the quantization of gravity quantization of the hamilton equations claus gerhardt abstract we quantize the hamilton equations instead of the hamil ton condition the resulting equation has the simple form u 0 in a fiber bundle where the laplacian is the laplacian of the wheeler dewitt metric provided n 6 4 using then separation of variables the solutions u can be expressed as products of temporal and spatial eigenfunctions where the spatial eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of the laplacian in the symmetric space sl n r so n since one can define a schwartz space and tempered distributions in sl n r so n as well as a fourier transform fourier quantization can be applied such that the spatial eigenfunctions are transformed to dirac measures and the spatial laplacian to a multiplication

globally hyperbolic lorentzian manifold r the scalar curvature and a cosmological constant we also omitted the integration density in the integral in order to apply a hamiltonian description of general relativity one usually defines a time function x 0 and considers the foliation of n given by the slices 1 2 m t x 0 t we may without loss of generality assume that the spacetime metric splits 1 3 ds 2 w 2 dx 0 2 gij x 0 x dxidxj cf 6 theorem 3 2 then the einstein equations also split into a tangential part 1 4 gij gij 0 and a normal part 1 5 g 0 where the naming refers to the given foliation for the tangential einstein equations one can define equivalent hamilton equations due to the ground breaking paper by arnowitt deser and misner 1 the normal einstein equations can be expressed by the so called hamilton condition 1 6 h 0 where h is the hamiltonian used in defining the hamilton equations in the canonical quantization of gravity the hamiltonian is transformed to a partial differential operator of hyperbolic type h and the possible quantum solutions of gravity are supposed to satisfy the so called wheeler dewitt equation 1 7 h u 0 in an appropriate setting i e only the hamilton condition 1 6 has been quantized or equivalently the normal einstein equation while the tangential einstein equations have been ignored in 6 we solved the equation 1 7 in a fiber bundle e with base space s 0 1 8 s 0 x 0 0 m 0 and fibers f x x s 0 1 9 f x t 0 2 x s 0 the elements of which are the positive definite symmetric tensors of order two the riemannian metrics in s 0 the hyperbolic operator h is then expressed in the form 1 10 h r 2 where is the laplacian of the wheeler dewitt metric given in the fibers r the scalar curvature of the metrics gij x f x and is defined by 1 11 2 det gij det ij quantization of the hamilton equations 3 where ij is a fixed metric in s 0 such that instead of densities we are con sidering functions the wheeler dewitt equation could be solved in e but only as an abstract hyperbolic equation the solutions could not be split in corresponding spatial and temporal eigenfunctions therefore we discarded the wheeler dewitt equation in 7 see also 8 chapter 1 and looked at the evolution equations given by the second hamil ton equation the left hand side a time derivative we replaced with the help of the poisson brackets on the right hand side we implemented the hamilton condition equation 1 6 after canonical quantization the poisson brackets became a commutator and we applied both sides of the equation to smooth functions with compact support defined in the fiber bundle the resulting equation we evaluated for a particular metric which we considered important to the problem and then obtained a hyperbolic equation in the base space which happened to be identical to the wheeler dewitt equation obtained as a result of a canonical quantization of a friedman universe if we only looked at functions that did not depend on x but only on the scale factor which now acted as a time variable evidently this result can not be regarded as the solution to the problem of quantizing gravity in a general setting the underlying mathematical reason for the difficulty was the presence of the term r in the quantized equation which prevents the application of separation of variables since the metrics gij are the spatial variables in this paper we overcome this difficulty by quantizing the hamilton equations without alterations i e we completely discard the hamilton condition from a logical point of view this approach is as justified as the prior procedure by quantizing only the normal einstein equation and discarding the tangential einstein equations despite the fact that the tangential einstein equations are equivalent to the hamilton equations this equivalence is considered to be an essential prerequisite for canonical quantization which is the quantization of the hamilton equations during quantization the transformed hamiltonian is acting on smooth functions u which are only defined in the fibers i e they only depend on the metrics gij and not explicitly on x s 0 as result we obtain the equation 1 12 u 0 in e where the laplacian is the laplacian in 1 10 the lower order terms of h 1 13 r 2 present on both sides of the equation cancel each other however the equa tion 1 12 is only valid provided n 6 4 since the resulting equation actually looks like 1 14 n 2 2 u 0 this restriction seems to be acceptable since n is the dimension of the base space s 0 which by general consent is assumed to be n 3 the fibers add quantization of the hamilton equations 4 additional dimensions to the quantized problem namely 1 15 dimf n n 1 2 m 1 the fiber metric the wheeler dewitt metric which is responsible for the laplacian in 1 12 can be expressed in the form 1 16 ds 2 16 n 1 n dt 2 gabd ad b where the coordinate system is 1 17 a 0 a t a the a 1 a m are coordinates for the hypersurface 1 18 m m x gij t 4 det gij x 1 x s 0 we also assume that s 0 rn and that the metric ij in 1 11 is the eu clidean metric ij it is well known that m is a symmetric space 1 19 m sl n r so n g k it is also easily verified that the induced metric of m in e is identical to the riemannian metric of the coset space g k now we are in a position to use separation of variables namely we write a solution of 1 12 in the form 1 20 u w t v a where v is a spatial eigenfunction of the induced laplacian of m 1 21 mv v 2 2 v and w is a temporal eigenfunction satisfying the ode 1 22 w mt 1 w 0 t 2 w 0 with 1 23 0 16 n 1 n 2 2 the eigenfunctions of the laplacian in g k are well known and we choose the kernel of the fourier transform in g k in order to define the eigenfunc tions this choice also allows us to use fourier quantization similar to the euclidean case such that the eigenfunctions are transformed to dirac mea sures and the laplacian to a multiplication operator in fourier space here is a more detailed overview of the main results let nak be an iwasawa decomposition of g and 1 24 g n a k be the corresponding direct sum of the lie algebras let a be the dual space of a then the fourier kernel is defined by the eigenfunctions 1 25 e b x e i loga x b quantization of the hamilton equations 5 with a x gk g k and b b where b is the furstenberg bound ary see section 5 and section 6 for detailed definitions and references we then pick a particular b 0 b and use e b 0 as eigenfunctions of 1 26 e b 0 2 2 e b 0 the fourier transform of e b 0 is 1 27 e b 0 b 0 and of f 1 28 f f 2 2 f a f s g k the elementary gravitons correspond to special characters in a namely 1 29 ij 1 i j n for the off diagonal gravitons and 1 30 i 1 i n 1 for the diagonal gravitons note that only n 1 diagonal elements gii can be freely chosen because of the condition 1 18 to define the temporal eigenfunctions we shall here only consider the case 3 n 16 then all temporal eigenfunctions are generated by the two real eigenfunctions contained in 1 31 w t t m 1 2 ei log t where 0 is chosen appropriately these eigenfunctions become un bounded if the big bang t 0 is approached and they vanish if t goes to infinity 2 definitions and notations the main objective of this section is to state the equations of gau codazzi and weingarten for spacelike hypersurfaces m in a n 1 dimen sional lorentzian manifold n geometric quantities in n will be denoted by g r etc and those in m by gij rijkl etc greek indices range from 0 to n and latin from 1 to n the summation convention is always used generic coordinate systems in n resp m will be denoted by x resp i covariant differentiation will simply be indicated by indices only in case of possible ambiguity they will be preceded by a semicolon i e for a function u in n u will be the gradient and u the hessian but e g the covariant derivative of the curvature tensor will be abbreviated by r we also point out that 2 1 r i r x i with obvious generalizations to other quantities letm be a spacelike hypersurface i e the induced metric is riemannian with a differentiable normal which is timelike quantization of the hamilton equations 6 in local coordinates x and i the geometric quantities of the spacelike hypersurface m are connected through the following equations 2 2 x ij hij the so called gau formula here and also in the sequel a covariant deriva tive is always a full tensor i e 2 3 x ij x ij k ijx k x i x j the comma indicates ordinary partial derivatives in this implicit definition the second fundamental form hij is taken with respect to the second equation is the weingarten equation 2 4 i h k i x k where we remember that i is a full tensor finally we have the codazzi equation 2 5 hij k hik j r x i x j x k and the gau equation 2 6 rijkl hikhjl hilhjk r x i x j x kx l now let us assume that n is a globally hyperbolic lorentzian manifold with a cauchy surface n is then a topological product i s 0 where i is an open interval s 0 is a riemannian manifold and there exists a gaussian coordinate system x such that the metric in n has the form 2 7 ds 2 n e 2 dx 0 2 ij x 0 x dxidxj where ij is a riemannian metric a function on n and x an abbreviation for the spacelike components xi we also assume that the coordinate system is future oriented i e the time coordinate x 0 increases on future directed curves hence the contravariant timelike vector 1 0 0 is future directed as is its covariant version e 2 1 0 0 let m graphu s 0 be a spacelike hypersurface 2 8 m x 0 x x 0 u x x s 0 then the induced metric has the form 2 9 gij e 2

2 hence graphu is spacelike if and only if du 1 the covariant form of a normal vector of a graph looks like 2 12 v 1 e 1 ui and the contravariant version is 2 13 v 1 e 1 ui thus we have remark 2 1 let m be spacelike graph in a future oriented coordinate system then the contravariant future directed normal vector has the form 2 14 v 1 e 1 ui and the past directed 2 15 v 1 e 1 ui in the gau formula 2 2 we are free to choose the future or past directed normal but we stipulate that we always use the past directed normal look at the component 0 in 2 2 and obtain in view of 2 15 2 16 e v 1 hij uij 000

an easy calculation shows 2 18 h ije 12 ij ij where the dot indicates differentiation with respect to x 0 3 the hamiltonian approach to general relativity the einstein equations with a cosmological constant in a lorentzian manifold n nn 1 n 3 with metric g 0 n are the euler lagrange equations of the functional 3 1 j n r 2 where r is the scalar curvature of the metric and where we omitted the density g the euler lagrange equations are 3 2 g g 0 quantization of the hamilton equations 8 where g is the einstein tensor we proved in 6 theorem 3 2 see also 8 theorem 1 3 2 that it suffices to consider only metrics that split i e metrics that are of the form 3 3 ds 2 w 2 dx 0 2 gij x 0 x dxidxj where xi are spatial coordinates x 0 is a time coordinate gij are riemannian metrics defined on the slices 3 4 m t x 0 t t a b and 3 5 0 w w x 0 x is an arbitrary smooth function in n a stationary metric in that restricted class is also stationary with respect to arbitrary compact variations and hence satisfies the full einstein equa tions following arnowitt deser and misner 1 the functional in 3 1 can be expressed in the form 3 6 j b a a 2 h 2 r 2 w g cf 8 equ 1 3 37 where 3 7 a 2 hijhij is the square of the second fundamental form of the slices m t 3 8 hij 12 w 1 g ij h 2 is the square of the mean curvature 3 9 h gijhij r the scalar curvature of the slices m t the interval a b is compactly contained in 3 10 i x 0 n and is a bounded open subset of the fixed slice 3 11 s 0 m 0 where we assume 3 12 0 i here we also assume n to be globally hyperbolic such that there exists a global time function and n can be written as a topological product 3 13 n i s 0 let f f hij be the scalar curvature operator 3 14 f 1 2 h 2 a 2 quantization of the hamilton equations 9 and let 3 15 f ij kl gijgkl 1 2 gikgjl gilgjk be its hessian then 3 16 f ij klhijhkl 2 f h 2 a 2 and 3 17 f ij f ij klhkl hgij hij in physics 3 18 gij kl f ij kl is known as the dewitt metric or more precisely a conformal metric where the conformal factor is even a density is known as the dewitt metric but we prefer the above definition combining 3 8 and 3 16 j can be expressed in the form 3 19 j b a 1 4 gij klg ij g klw 2 r 2 w g the lagrangian density l is a regular lagrangian with respect to the vari ables gij define the conjugate momenta 3 20 ij l g ij 1 2 gij klg klw 1 g gij klhkl g and the

gij the tan gential einstein equations 3 23 gij gij 0 are equivalent to the hamilton equations 3 24 g ij h ij and 3 25 ij h gij where the differentials on the right hand side of these equations are varia tional or functional derivatives quantization of the hamilton equations 10 the mixed einstein equations vanish 3 26 g 0 j g 0 j 0 1 j n and the normal equation 3 27 g 0 is equivalent to 3 28 a 2 h 2 r 2 cf 5 equ 1 1 43 which in turn is equivalent to 3 29 h 0 which is also known as the hamilton condition we define the poisson brackets 3 30 u v u gkl v kl u kl v gkl and obtain 3 31 gij kl klij where 3 32 klij 1 2 ki l j l i k j then the second hamilton equation can also be expressed as 3 33 ij ij h in the next section we want to quantize the hamilton equations or more precisely 3 34 gij ij h gij h gij n 2 2 a 2 h 2 w g n 2 r 2 w g rw g n 1 w g cf 8 equ 1 3 64 1 3 65 where is the laplacian with respect to the metric gij t 4 the quantization for the quantization of the hamiltonian setting we first replace all densities by tensors by choosing a fixed riemannian metric in s 0 4 1 ij x and for a given metric g gij t x we define 4 2 x gij det gij det ij 1 2 quantization of the hamilton equations 11 such that the einstein hilbert functional j in 3 19 on page 9 can be written in the form 4 3 j b a 1 4 gij klg ij g klw 2 r 2 w the hamilton density h is then replaced by the function 4 4 h 1 gij kl ij kl r 2 w where now 4 5 ij gij klhkl and 4 6 hij 1 gij kl kl the effective hamiltonian is of course 4 7 w 1 h fortunately we can at least locally assume 4 8 w 1 by choosing an appropriate coordinate system let t 0 x 0 n be an arbi trary point then consider the cauchy hypersurface 4 9 m t 0 t 0 s 0 and look at a tubular neighbourhood ofm t 0 i e we define new coordinates t xi where xi are coordinate for s 0 near x 0 and t is the signed lorentzian distance to m t 0 such that the points 4 10 0 xi m t 0 the lorentzian metric of the ambient space then has the form 4 11 ds 2 dt 2 gijdxidxj secondly we use the same model as in 6 section 3 the riemannian metrics gij t are elements of the bundle t 0 2 s 0 denote by e the fiber bundle with base s 0 where the fibers consist of the riemannian metrics gij we shall consider each fiber to be a lorentzian manifold equipped with the dewitt metric each fiber f has dimension 4 12 dimf n n 1 2 m 1 let a 0 a m be coordinates for a local trivialization such that 4 13 gij x a is a local embedding the dewitt metric is then expressed as 4 14 gab gij klgij agkl b quantization of the hamilton equations 12 where a comma indicates partial differentiation in the new coordinate system the curves 4 15 t gij t x can be written in the form 4 16 t a t x and we infer 4 17 gij klg ij g kl gab a b hence we can express 3 6 as 4 18 j b a 1 4 gab a b r 2 where we now refrain from writing down the density explicitly since it does not depend on gij and therefore should not be part of the legendre transformation we also emphasize that we are now working in the gauge w 1 denoting the lagrangian function in 4 18 by l we define 4 19 a l a gab 1 2 b and we obtain for the hamiltonian function h 4 20 h a l a l gab 1 2 a 1 2 b r 2 1 gab a b r 2 where gab is the inverse metric the fibers equipped with the metric 4 21 gab are then globally hyperbolic lorentzian manifolds as we proved in 8 theo rem 1 4 2 in the fibers we can introduce new coordinates a 0 a 0 a m and 1 a m such that 4 22 0 log and a are coordinates for the hypersurface 4 23 m 1 0 the lorentzian metric in the fibers can then be expressed in the form 4 24 ds 2 4 n 1 n d 2 gabd ad b quantization of the hamilton equations 13 cf 8 equ 1 4 28 where we note that in that reference is a misprint namely the spatial part of the metric has an additional factor 4 n 1 n which should be omitted defining a new time variable 0 t by setting 4 25 t 2 we infer 4 26 ds 2 16 n 1 n dt 2 gabd ad b the new metric gab is independent of t when we work in a local trivial ization of the bundle e the coordinates a are independent of x as well as the time coordinate t cf 8 lemma 1 4 4 we can now quantize the hamiltonian setting using the original variables gij and ij we consider the bundle e equipped with the metric 4 24 or equivalently 4 27 gij kl which is the covariant form in the fibers and with the riemannian metric in s 0 furthermore let 4 28 c c e be the space of real valued smooth functions with compact support in e in the quantization process where we choose 1 the variables gij and ij are then replaced by operators g ij and ij acting in c c e satisfying the commutation relations 4 29 g ij kl i klij while all the other commutators vanish these operators are realized by defining g ij to be the multiplication operator 4 30 g iju giju and ij to be the functional differentiation 4 31 ij 1 i gij i e if u c c e then 4 32 u gij is the euler lagrange operator of the functional 4 33 s 0 u s 0 u hence if u only depends on x gij and not on derivatives of the metric then 4 34 u gij u gij quantization of the hamilton equations 14 therefore the transformed hamiltonian h can be looked at as the hyperbolic differential operator 4 35 h r 2 where is the laplacian of the metric in 4 27 acting on functions 4 36 u u x gij we used this approach in 6 to transform the hamilton constraint to the wheeler dewitt equation 4 37 h u 0 in e which can be solved with suitable cauchy conditions however the above hyperbolic equation can only be solved abstractly because of the scalar cur vature term r which makes any attempt to apply separation of variables techniques impossible therefore we discard the wheeler dewitt equation by ignoring the hamilton constraint and quantize the hamilton equations in stead this approach is certainly as justified as quantizing the hamilton con straint which takes only the normal einstein equations into account whereas the hamilton equations are equivalent to the tangential einstein equations furthermore the resulting hyperbolic equation will be independent of r and we can apply separation of variables following dirac the poisson brackets in 3 33 on page 10 are replaced by 1 i times the commutators in the quantization process since 1 i e we obtain 4 38 ij h i h ij dropping the hats in the following to improve the readability equation 3 34 is then transformed to 4 39 igij h ij n 2 2 a 2 h 2 n 2 r 2 r where we note that now w 1 we have 4 40 i h ij h gij gij r 2 gij cf 4 35 we apply both sides to functions u c c e where we addition ally require 4 41 u u gij i e u does not explicitly depend on x s 0 hence we deduce 4 42 gij u gij u rij klu kl because of the ricci identities where 4 43 rij kl quantization of the hamilton equations 15 is the ricci tensor of the fiber metric 4 27 and 4 44 ukl u gkl is the gradient of u for the second commutator on the right hand side of 4 40 we obtain 4 45 r 2 gij u r 2 u gij gij r 2 u where the last term is the euler lagrange operator of the functional 4 46 s 0 r 2 u s 0 r 2 u s 0 r 2 u g with respect to the variable gij since the scalar curvature r depends on the derivatives of gij in view of 8 equ 1 4 84 we have 4 47 gij r 2 u 1 2 r 2 giju riju u ij ug ij r 2 u gij where the semicolon indicates covariant differentiation in s 0 with respect to the metric gij is the corresponding laplacian we also note that 4 48 dku u xk u gij gij xk u xk 0 in riemannian normal coordinates hence we conclude that the operator on the left hand side of equation 4 39 applied to u is equal to 4 49 n 2 r 2 u r u in e since 4 50 gijr ij kl 0 cf 8 equ 1 4 89 on the other hand applying the right hand side of 4 39 to u we obtain 4 51 n 2 2 u n 2 r 2 u r u where the laplacian is the laplacian in the fibers since 4 52 a 2 h 2 1 gij kl ij kl thus we conclude 4 53 n 2 2 u 0 quantization of the hamilton equations 16 in e and we have proved the following theorem theorem 4 1 the quantization of equation 3 34 on page 10 leads to the hyperbolic equation 4 54 u 0 in e provided n 6 4 and u c c e only depends on the fiber elements gij to solve the equation 4 54 we first choose the gaussian coordinate system a t a such that the metric has form as in 4 26 then the hyperbolic equation can be expressed as 4 55 n 16 n 1 t m t tm u t t 2 u 0 where is the laplacian of the hypersurface 4 56 m t 1 we shall try to use separation of variables by considering solutions u which are products 4 57 u t a w t v a where v is a spatial eigenfunction or eigendistribution of the laplacian 4 58 v v and w a temporal eigenfunction satisfying the ode 4 59 n 16 n 1 t m t tm w t t 2 w 0 which can be looked at as an implicit eigenvalue equation the function u in 4 57 will then be a solution of 4 54 in the next sections we shall determine spatial and temporal eigendistri butions by assuming 4 60 s 0 rn equipped with the euclidean metric the dimension n is then merely sup posed to satisfy n 3 though of course the equation 4 54 additionally requires n 6 4 5 spatial eigenfunctions in m the hypersurface 5 1 m 1 can be considered to be a sub bundle of e where each fiber m x is a hypersurface in the fiber f x of e we shall use the same notation m for the sub bundle as well as for the hypersurface and in general we shall omit the reference to the base point x s 0 furthermore we specify the metric quantization of the hamilton equations 17 ij t 0 2 s 0 which we used to define to be equal to the euclidean metric such that in euclidean coordinates 5 2 2 det gij det ij det gij then it is well known that each m x with the induced metric gab is a symmetric space namely it is isometric to the coset space 5 3 g k sl n r so n cf 2 equ 5 17 p 1123 and 15 p 3 the eigenfunctions in symmetric spaces and especially of the coset space in 5 3 are well known they are the so called spherical functions one can also define a fourier transformation for functions in l 2 g k and prove a plancherel formula similar to the euclidean case cf 14 chapter iii also similar to the euclidean case we shall use the fourier kernel to define the eigenfunctions or eigendistributions since the spherical functions because of their symmetry properties are not specific enough to represent the elementary gravitons corresponding to the diagonal metric variables gii 1 i n 1 recall that from the n diagonal coefficients of a metric only n 1 are independent because of the assumption 5 4 det gij 1 which has to be satisfied by the elements of m but before we can define the eigenfunctions and analyze their properties we have to recall some basic definitions and results of the theory of symmetric spaces we shall mainly consider the coset space in 5 3 which will be the relevant space for our purpose its so called quadratic model the naming of which will be obvious in the following is the space of symmetric positive definite matrices in rn with determinant equal to 1 i e the quadratic model of g k is identical to an arbitrary fiber m x of the sub bundle m of e since the symmetric space g k as a riemannian space is isometric to its quadratic model the eigenfunctions of the laplacian in the respective spaces can be identified via the isometry unless otherwise noted the symbol x should denote the coset space g k where g is the lie group sl n r and k so n the elements of g will be referred to by g h we shall also express the elements in x by x y and by a slight abuse of notation the elements of m will also occasionally be referred to by the symbol g but always in the form gij the canonical isometry between the quadratic model m and x is given by the map 5 5 g k m x gk gk x gk gk gg where the star denotes the transpose hence the name quadratic model for fixed gij m the action 5 6 g gij g gij g g g quantization of the hamilton equations 18 is an isometry in m where m is equipped with the metric 5 7 g ij kl 1 2 gikgjl gilgjk and where 5 8 gij gij 1 cf 8 equ 1 4 46 p 22 let 5 9 g nak be an iwasawa decomposition of g where n is the subgroup of unit upper triangle matrices a the abelian subgroup of diagonal matrices with strictly positive diagonal components and k so n the corresponding lie alge bras are denoted by 5 10 g n a and k here 5 11 g real

an with positive entries 5 15 log a diag log ai hence 5 16 a g eloga g helgason uses the symbol a g if g decomposed as in 5 9 but uses the symbol h g if 5 17 g kan which can be obtained by applying the isomorphism 5 18 g g 1 because of the uniqueness 5 19 h g a g 1 quantization of the hamilton equations 19 hence 5 20 logh g loga g cf 14 equs 2 3 p 198 note that the functions we define in g should also be defined in g k i e we would want that 5 21 a g a gk which is indeed the case if we used the iwasawa decomposition g kan then 5 22 h g h kg would be valid which would be useful if we considered the right coset space k g remark 5 1 i the lie algebra a is a n 1 dimensional real algebra which as a vector space is equipped with a natural real symmetric scalar product namely the trace form 5 23 h 1 h 2 tr h 1 h 2 hi a ii let a be the dual space of a its elements will be denoted by greek symbols some of which have a special meaning in the literature the linear forms are also called additive characters iii let a then there exists a unique matrix h a such that 5 24 h h h h a this definition allows to define a dual trace form in a by setting for a 5 25 h h iv the lie algebra g is a direct sum 5 26 g n a k let eij 1 i j n be the matrices with component 1 in the entry i j and other components zero then these matrices form a basis of n for h a h diag xi the lie bracket in g which is simply the commutator applied to h and eij yields 5 27 h eij xi xj eij h a hence the eij are the eigenvectors for the characters ij a defined by 5 28 ij h xi xj here eij is said to be an eigenvector of ij if 5 29 h eij ij h eij h a the eigenspace of ij is one dimensional the characters ij are called the relevant characters or the a n characters they are also called the positive quantization of the hamilton equations 20 restricted roots the set of these characters will be denoted by we define 5 30 and 5 31 1 2 lemma 5 2 let h diag xi a and define 5 32 i h i k 1 xk for 1 i n 1 then 5 33 n 1 i 1 i furthermore 5 34 1 12 n 1 2 n proof 5 33 follows from the definition of and for details see 15 p 84 5 34 from 5 25 we obtain 5 35 h h and the definition of implies 5 36 h 1 2 h on the other hand 5 37 h n 1 i 1 ci where ci a has 1 in the first i entries of the diagonal i in the i 1 th entry and zero in the other entries furthermore 5 38 ci cj 0 i 6 j and 5 39 ci ci i 2 i cf 15 p 266 hence we conclude 5 40 1 4 n 1 i 1 i 2 i 1 12 n 1 2 n quantization of the hamilton equations 21 remark 5 3 the eigenfunctions of the laplacian will depend on the additive characters the above characters ij 1 i j n will represent the elementary gravitons stemming from the degrees of freedom in choosing the coordinates 5 41 gij 1 i j n of a metric tensor the diagonal elements offer in general additional n degrees of freedom but in our case where we consider metrics satisfying 5 42 det gij 1 only n 1 diagonal components can be freely chosen and we shall choose the first n 1 entries namely 5 43 gii 1 i n 1 the corresponding additive characters are named i 1 i n 1 and are defined by 5 44 i h hi if 5 45 h diag h 1 hn the characters i 1 i n 1 and ij 1 i j n will represent the n 2 n 1 2 elementary gravitons at the character level we shall normalize the characters by defining 5 46 i h i 1 i and 5 47 ij h ij 1 ij such that the normalized characters have unit norm cf 5 25 definition 5 4 let a then we define the spherical function 5 48 g k e i loga kg dk g g where the haar measure dk is normalized such that k has measure 1 and where g nak observe that 5 49 g gk i e can be lifted to x g k the weyl chambers are the connected components of the set 5 50 a 1 i j n 1 ij 0 quantization of the hamilton equations 22 they consist of diagonal matrices having distinct eigenvalues the weyl chamber a defined by 5 51 a h a ij h 0 1 i j n is called the positive weyl chamber and the elements h a h diag hi satisfy 5 52 h 1 h 2 hn let m resp m be the centralizer resp normalizer of a in k then 5 53 w m m is the weyl group which acts simply transitive on the weyl chambers the weyl group can be identified with the group sn of permutations in our case i e if s w and h diag hi a then 5 54 s h diag hs i the subgroup m consists of the diagonal matrices diag i with i 1 let b be the homogeneous space 5 55 b k m then b is a compact riemannian space with a k invariant riemannian met ric cf 16 theorem 3 5 p 203 b is known as the furstenberg boundary of x and the map 5 56 b a x km a kak is a differentiable surjective map while the restriction of to 5 57 b a a exp a is a diffeomorphism with an open dense image also 5 58 x ka ek cf 14 prop 1 4 p 62 if x gk b km and g nak we define 5 59 a x b a gk km a k 1 g cf 5 13 we are now ready to describe the fourier theory and plancherel formula due to harish chandra fork bi invariant functions cf 9 10 and 11 p 48 and by helgason for arbitrary functions in l 1 x and l 2 x cf 12 and 13 theorem 2 6 the extension of the fourier transform to the schwartz space s x and its inversion is due to eguchi and okamato 4 this paper is only an announcement without proofs the proofs are given in 3 we follow the presentation in helgason s book 14 chapter iii to simplify the expressions in the coming formulas the measures are normalized such that the total measures of compact spaces are 1 and the quantization of the hamilton equations 23 lebesgue measure in euclidean space is normalized such that the fourier transform and its inverse can be expressed by the simple formulas 5 60 f rn f x e i x dx and 5 61 f x rn f ei x d the fourier transform for functions f c c x c is then defined by 5 62 f b x f x e i loga x b dx for a and b b or if we define 5 63 e b x e i loga x b by 5 64 f b x f x e b x dx the functions e b are real analytic in x and are eigenfunctions of the lapla cian cf 14 prop 3 14 p 99 5 65 e b 2 2 e b where 5 66 2 cf 5 25 and similarly for 2 we also denote the fourier transform by f such that 5 67 f f f its inverse f 1 is defined in r f by 5 68 f x 1 w b a f b c 2 d db where c is harish chandra s c function and 5 69 w cardw the number of elements in w in our case w n as in the euclidean case a plancherel formula is valid namely citing from 14 theorem 1 5 p 202 theorem 5 5 the fourier transform f x f b defined by 5 62 extends to an isometry of l 2 x onto l 2 a b with measure c 2 d db on a b moreover 5 70 x f 1 x f 2 x dx 1 w a b f 1 b f 2 b c 2 d db quantization of the hamilton equations 24 we shall consider the eigenfunctions e b as tempered distributions of the schwartz space s x and shall use their fourier transforms 5 71 e b b b as the spatial eigenfunctions of 5 72 f m 2 2 which is a multiplication operator in the next section 6 fourier quantization the fourier theory in x g k which we described at the end of the preceding section uses the eigenfunctions 6 1 e b x e i loga x b b a b as the fourier kernel the fourier quantization in euclidean space uses the fourier transform of the hamilton operator or only the spatial part of hamilton operator which in our case is 6 2 m x and the fourier transforms of the corresponding physically relevant eigen functions if the hamilton operator is the euclidean laplacian in rn then the spatial eigenfunctions would be 6 3 ei x therefore we consider the eigenfunctions e b as a starting point as in the euclidean case the e b are tempered distributions we first need to extend the fourier theory to the corresponding schwartz space s x and its dual space s x the space of tempered distributions let d g be the algebra of left invariant differential operators in g and d g be the algebra of right invariant differential operators furthermore let 6 4 0 0 be the spherical function with parameter 0 then 0 satisfies the following estimates 6 5 0 0 a 0 e 1 a a and 6 6 0 a c 1 a de log a a a where 6 7 d card the cardinality of the set of positive restricted roots here we used the following definitions for g k 1 ak 2 a a k 1 k 2 k cf 5 58 on page 22 6 8 g a log a quantization of the hamilton equations 25 and c is a positive constant the schwartz space s x is then defined by definition 6 1 the schwartz space s g is defined as the subspace of c g c the topology of which is given by the semi norms 6 9 pl d e f sup g g 1 g l 0 g 1 def g for arbitrary l n d d g and e d g the schwartz space s x consists of those functions in s g which are right invariant under k the fourier transform for f s x is then well defined 6 10 f b x f x e b x dx integrating over b we obtain 6 11 f b f b db x f x b e i loga x b dbdx x f x x dx cf 17 equ 1 8 for the last inequality hence we deduce lemma 6 2 f satisfies 6 12 f s f s w proof the spherical function has this property cf 15 theorem 5 2 p 100 next we define the schwartz space s a b note that a is a euclidean space in our case a rn 1 and b k m is a compact riemannian space hence we define the schwartz space s a b as follows cf 4 def 2 p 240 definition 6 3 let s a b denote the set of all functions f c a b c which satisfy the following condition for any natural numbers l m q 6 13 pl m q f sup b a b 1 2 l m b 1 qd f where 1 r r dim a is a multi index 6 14 d f d 11 d r r f are partial derivatives with respect to a and b is the laplacian in b quantization of the hamilton equations 26 the semi norms pl m q define a topology on s a b with respect to which it is a fr chet space theorem 6 4 the fourier transform f 6 15 f s x s a b is continuous and if we define 6 16 s a b f s a b f b f b db satisfies 6 12 then 6 17 f s x s a b is a linear topological isomorphism proof confer 4 theorem 4 and 3 lemma 4 8 2 theorem 4 8 3 p 212 remark 6 5 note that the measure in s a b is defined by 6 18 d b 1 w c 2 d db and that the function 6 19 c 1 has slow growth cf 14 lemma 3 5 p 91 we can now define the fourier quantization let s x resp s a b be the dual spaces of tempered distributions then 6 20 f 1 s a b s x is continuous let f 1 be the dual operator 6 21 f 1 s x s a b defined by 6 22 f 1 f b f 1 f b for s x and f s a b let 6 23 f b f b f s x then 6 24 f f 1 f now choose e b where b a b is arbitrary but fixed then 6 25 f x f x e b x dx f b hence we deduce 6 26 f 1 b b quantization of the hamilton equations 27 lemma 6 6 let s x then we may call f 1 to be the fourier transform of 6 27 f 1 proof s x can be embedded in s x be defining for s x 6 28 f x f dx f s x is obviously an element of s x and the embedding is antilinear on the other hand in view of the plancherel formula we have 6 29 x f dx a b f b b d b and thus because of 6 24 6 30 f 1 f a b f d b looking at the fourier transformed eigenfunctions 6 31 e b b it is obvious that the dependence on b has to be eliminated since there is neither a physical nor a mathematical motivation to distinguish between e b and e b the first ansatz would be to integrate over b i e we would consider the fourier transform of 6 32 b e bdb which is equal to the fourier transform of the spherical function i e 6 33 and it would act on the functions 6 34 f b f b db f s x these functions satisfy the relation 6 12 which in turn implies 6 35 s s 1 s w if was allowed to range in all of a hence we would have to restrict to the positive weyl chamber a but then we would not be able to define the eigenfunctions corresponding to the elementary gravitons gii 2 i n 1 since the corresponding belong to different weyl chambers cf remark 5 3 on page 21 therefore we pick a distinguished b b namely 6 36 b 0 em e id k quantization of the hamilton equations 28 and only consider the eigenfunctions e b 0 with corresponding fourier trans forms 6 37 b 0 e b 0 a then we can prove lemma 6 7 let be defined as above then for any s w satisfying s 6 there exists f s a b such that 6 38 f f b 0 6 f s b 0 s f proof let c c a be a function satisfying 6 39 6 s and choose c b with the properties 6 40 b 0 1 and 6 41 b db 0 then 6 42 f s a b and satisfies 6 38 the fourier transform of the laplacian is a multiplication operator similar to the euclidean case lemma 6 8 i let f s x then 6 43 f f m f b s a b where 6 44 m 2 2 a ii let s x then is defined as usual 6 45 f f and 6 46 f m s a b where 6 47 m f b m f b f s a b quantization of the hamilton equations 29 proof i the result follows immediately by partial integration ii from 6 24 and 6 45 we deduce 6 48 f f f m f b m f b f f b now choosing 6 49 e b 0 where a is fixed then 6 50 f m m m since 6 51 m f b m f b m f b 0 in remark 5 3 on page 21 we already identified the additive characters cor responding to the elementary gravitons namely the characters 6 52 ij 1 i j n and 6 53 i 1 i n 1 we shall now define the corresponding forms in a with arbitrary energy levels definition 6 9 let r be arbitrary then we consider the characters 6 54 i ij where we recall that the terms embellished by a tilde refer to the corre sponding unit vectors then the eigenfunctions representing the elementary gravitons are e i b 0 and e ij b 0 the corresponding eigenvalue with respect to is 2 2 where by a slight abuse of notation 2 2 and 2 note that 2 is always strictly positive indeed 6 55 n 2 3 2 1 if x sl n r so n and n 3 cf 5 40 on page 20 quantization of the hamilton equations 30 7 temporal eigenfunctions the temporal eigenfunctions w w t have to satisfy the ode 4 59 on page 16 or equivalently 7 1 w mt 1 w 0 t 2 w 0 where 0 should be equal to 7 2 0 16 n 1 n 2 2 and where 2 2 is the eigenvalue of a spatial eigenfunction to solve 7 1 we make the ansatz 7 3 w t t m 1 2 ei log t 0 to obtain 7 4 w mt 1 w 0 t 2 w m 1 2 4 0 2 w in order to choose such that the term in the braces vanishes we have to ensure that 7 5 0 m 1 2 4 0 now the estimate 7 6 0 m 1 2 4 16 n 1 n 2 m 1 2 4 is valid where 7 7 2 n 1 2 n 12 and 7 8 m n 1 n 2 2 one can easily check that 7 9 16 n 1 n 2 m 1 2 4 0 3 n 16 0 17 n in case n 17 and 7 10 0 m 1 2 4 0 we obtain the solution 7 11 w c 1 t m 1 2 m 1 2 4 0 c 2 t m 1 2 m 1 2 4 0 while for 7 12 0 m 1 2 4 0 quantization of the hamilton equations 31 we get 7 13 w c 1 t m 1 2 c 2 t m 1 2 log t remark 7 1 in all three cases 7 5 7 10 and 7 12 we obtain two real independent solutions which become unbounded if the big bang t 0 is approached and vanish if t goes to infinity the two real solutions contained in 7 3 which generate all possible temporal eigenfunctions if 3 n 16 seem to be the physically relevant solutions 8 conclusions quantizing the hamilton equations instead of the hamilton constraint we obtained the simple equation 8 1 u 0 in the fiber bundle e provided n 6 4 where the laplacian is the laplacian of the wheeler dewitt metric in the fibers and where u is a smooth function which is only defined in the fibers of e 8 2 u u gij x x s 0 rn expressing then the fiber metric as in 4 26 on page 13 we can use separation of variables and write the solutions u as products 8 3 u w t v gij x a where gij x a is a local trivialization of the sub bundle m the fibers of which consists of the metrics gij with unit determinant or more precisely 8 4 det gij x det ij x 1 where ij is the euclidean metric using euclidean coordinates in s 0 we can identify the fibers m x with the symmetric space 8 5 g k sl n rn so n the riemannian metric in g k is identical to the induced fiber metric of m x such that the spatial eigenfunctions of the corresponding spatial laplacians can also be identified due to the well known fourier theory in g k we choose the fourier kernel elements 8 6 e b 0 y e i loga y b 0 a where we used the iwasawa decomposition g nak and where b 0 is the distinguished point specified in 6 36 on page 27 these smooth functions are tempered distributions and are eigenfunctions of the laplacian 8 7 e b 0 2 2 e b 0 their fourier transforms are dirac measures 8 8 e b 0 b 0 quantization of the hamilton equations 32 in fourier space the laplacian is a multiplication operator 8 9 f f 2 2 f b f s g k where ranges in a and b in the furstenberg boundary b let 8 10 g k m be the canonical isometry defined in 5 5 on page 17 then the eigenfunctions f in g k can be transformed to be eigenfunctions in the fibers of the sub bundle m by defining 8 11 v gij x a f 1 gij x a i e 8 12 e b 0 1 gij x a a are the spatial eigenfunctions with eigenvalues 2 2 the eigenfunc tions corresponding to the elementary gravitons we defined in definition 6 9 on page 29 they are characterized by special characters i 1 i n 1 for the diagonal gravitons and ij 1 i j n for the off diagonal gravitons the temporal eigenfunctions w t which we defined in the previous sec tion have the properties that they become unbounded if t 0 and they vanish together with all derivatives if t furthermore if we consider t 0 then the functions 8 13 w t w t t 0 also satisfy the ode 7 1 on page 30 for t 0 i e they are also temporal eigenfunctions if the light cone in e is flipped thus we conclude theorem 8 1 the quantum model we derived for gravity can be de scribed by products of spatial and temporal eigenfunctions of corresponding self adjoint operators with a continuous spectrum the spatial eigenfunctions can be expressed as dirac measures in fourier space and the spatial laplacian as a multiplication operator the spatial eigenvalues are strictly positive 8 14 2 2 2 3 2 1 choosing 0 we have a common ground state with smallest eigenvalue 2 which could be considered to be the source of the dark energy furthermore we have a big bang singularity in t 0 since the same quantum model is also valid by switching from t 0 to t 0 with appropriate changes to the temporal eigenfunctions one could argue that at the big bang two universes with different time orientations could have been created such that in view of the cpt theorem one was filled with matter and the other with anti matter quantization of the hamilton equations
