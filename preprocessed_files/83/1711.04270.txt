relativity many basic properties of gravity have been discovered through investigations of test particle motions in gravitational fields of different massive sources the classical results concerning mo tions of a simple particle which follows geodesic lines in schwarzschild s and kerr s metrics are presented for ex ample in 1 2 if a test particle possesses inner ro tation spin in general its motion differs from geodesic the equations which describe motions of a macroscopic spinning particle in gravitational fields were obtained in 3 and have been rederived later in 4 8 and in many other papers now these equations are known as mathisson papapetrou mp or mathisson papapetrou dixon mpd equations in addition it was shown that in a certain sense these equations follow from the general relativistic dirac equation as a classical approximation 9 in the first papers where some partial solutions of the mp equations were investigated the schwarzschild 10 11 melvin 12 and lense thirring 13 metrics were taken into account the physical effects of the spin gravity interaction in kerr s spacetime are presented in 14 18 more full bibliography can be found in 19 20 and in other papers in some recent publications the mp equations are studied for the schwarzschild de sitter spacetime 21 24 as usual the effects of the spin gravity coupling on spinning particle motion are very small however un der certain specific conditions when the orbital velocity of a spinning particle relative to a source of the gravi tational field is close to the speed of light role of the spin gravity coupling becomes much greater different types of highly relativistic motions of a spinning particle in schwarzschild s and kerr s background were studied in 26 33 it was shown that depending on the correla tion of signs of the spin and the particle s orbital velocity the spin gravity coupling acts as a significant repulsive or attractive force what is the dependence of the influence of the cos mological constant on a spinning particle for its different velocities relative to the schwarzschild source of the grav itational field answering this question is the purpose of this paper note that now the role of the cosmological constant is widely considered in cosmology and astro physics the paper is organized in the following way section ii is devoted to the consideration of the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic components of the single gravita tional field in general relativity which can be estimated by an observer moving in the schwarzschild de sitter back ground with arbitrary velocity in sec iii we present necessary information about the mp equations and then study the spin gravity coupling in the schwarzschild de sitter background from the point of view of an observer comoving with the spinning particle different cases of highly relativistic circular orbits of a spinning particle in this background which are caused by the strong spin gravity repulsion or attraction are in the focus of sec iv we conclude in sec v ii gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic components from the point of view of a moving observer in the schwarzschild de sitter background we use the schwarzschild de sitter metric in the stan dard coordinates x 1 r x 2 x 3 x 4 t then the nonzero components of the metric tensor g are g 11 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 g 22 r 2 g 33 r 2 sin 2 g 44 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 wherem and 0 are respectively the mass parameter and the cosmological constant in this paper we use the http arxiv org abs 1711 04270 v 2 2 signature of the metric and the unites c g 1 are chosen in order to investigate the physical properties of the schwarzschild de sitter background it is appropriate to consider some specific features of the gravitational field which is determined by metric 1 from the point of view of any observer moving relative to a source with the mass m for the description of this motion one can use the local tetrad coordinates which are put in the parenthesis below according to the general definition the expres sions of the values e i k and b i k are 25 e i k r i 4 k 4 2 b i k 1 2 r i 4 m n m n k 3 where e i k and b i k are the gravitoelectric and gravit omagnetic components of the gravitational field respec tively in contrast to greek indices which run 1 2 3 4 latin indices in 2 and 3 run 1 2 3 let us consider relationships 2 and 3 in the spe cific case of the schwarzschild de sitter metric with out loss of generality we put that the plane of the ob server motion is 2 it is convenient to orient the first space axis 1 of the local basis along the di rection which is orthogonal to the plane determined by the direction of the observer motion and the radial di rection to the mass m and the second space axis 2 we orient along the direction of this motion as a di rect result of such choice of the local basis orientation we write e 1 e 1 0 e 1 e 3 0 e 2 e 2 0 e 3 e 2 0 where e i and e j are the vectors of the local and global basis respectively then for the tetrad components we have 1 1 0 3 1 0 2 2 0 2 3 0 other tetrad components which are nonzero can be found from the general relationship between the metric tensor g and g 4 where is the minkowski tensor it is not difficult to verify that according to 4 the full set of the nonzero tetrad components can be presented in the following form 2 1 g 22 1 2 u 1 u 4 g 44 u 4 u 4 1 3 2 u 3 u 4 g 44 u 4 u 4 1 4 2 u 4 u 4 1 g 44 1 3 u 3 g 11 g 33 u 4 u 4 1 3 3 u 1 g 33 g 11 u 4 u 4 1 1 4 u 1 3 4 u 3 4 4 u 4 5 where u 1 dr ds u 3 d ds u 4 dt ds are the components of the observer 4 velocity for the motion in the plane 2 we have u 2 0 to obtain the nonzero tetrad components of riemann s tensor r we use the general relationship r r 6 where r are the components of the riemann ten sor in the global coordinates the components r for metric 1 can be calculated in the direct manner and for the sake of brevity we do not write here the correspond ing explicit expressions instead of taking into account relationships 5 and 6 we write the final nonzero ex pressions for e i k and b i k according to 2 and 3 e 1 1 m r 3 3 3 m r 3 u 2 e 2 2 2 m r 3 3 3 m r 3 u 2 u 4 u 4 1 e 2 3 e 3 2 3 m r 3 u u u 4 u 4 u 4 1 e 3 3 m r 3 3 3 m r 3 u 2 u 4 u 4 u 4 u 4 1 7 b 1 2 b 2 1 3 mu u r 3 u 4 u 4 1 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 2 b 1 3 b 3 1 3 mu 2 u 4 r 3 u 4 u 4 1 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 2 8 where u dr ds and u rd ds are the radial and tangential components of the observer 4 velocity and by the general expression u u 1 we have u 4 u 4 1 u 2 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 u 2 9 relationships 7 and 8 hold true for any arbitrary ve locity of the observer if the condition 1 2 m r r 2 3 0 10 i e g 44 0 is satisfied similarly to the case of schwarzschild s background which was considered in 34 expressions 7 and 8 show that the special direction exists in space along which the components e i k and b i k remain finite because in the 3 case with u 0 all components e i k and b i k are finite for any u moreover then according to 8 all compo nents b i k are equal to 0 and this property is similar to the corresponding one in electrodynamics when the usual magnetic field of the moving electric charge is estimated in general when u 6 0 the components e i k and b i k in 7 and 8 significantly depend on the observer motion note that the corresponding dependence of the gravitoelectric components in schwarzschild s field as well as the gravitomagnetic components caused by a ro tating mass in the post newtonian approximation were considered in 34 in the context of the tidal accelerations estimation it is convenient to consider expressions 7 and 8 using the lorentz factor as estimated by an observer which is at rest relative to the source of the gravitational field the value of which corresponds to the u and u is given by the expression 1 1 v 2 11 where v 2 is the second power of the particle s 3 velocity relative to the observer in the case of the diagonal met ric according to the general expression for the 3 velocity components vi we have 35 vi dxi g 44 dt 12 then for v 2 we write v 2 viv i ikv ivk 13 where ik is the 3 space metric tensor with the following relationship between ik and g for the diagonal metric ik gik it follows from 11 13 with u u 1 that u 4 u 4 14 for our further purposes we write the values of the components b i k using factor explicitly then by 8 and 14 we have b 1 2 b 2 1 3 m r 3 u u 2 1 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 2 15 b 1 3 b 3 1 3 m r 3 u 2 2 1 16 let us compare the values from 15 and 16 at low and high velocities when the velocity is low with u 1 u 2 1 1 2 1 and 2 1 2 1 where by 9 2 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 21 2 2 17 it follows from 15 and 16 that b 1 2 b 2 1 3 m r 3 1 2 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 2 18 b 1 3 b 3 1 3 m r 3 22 19 that is at low velocity the common term 3 m r 3 in the expressins for the gravitomagnetic components 18 and 19 is multiplied by corresponding small factors whereas in the highly relativistic region when 2 1 and both u 2 and u 2 have order 2 it follows from 15 and 16 that b 1 2 b 2 1 3 m r 3 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 2 20 b 1 3 b 3 1 3 m r 3 2 21 when only u 2 1 with u 2 u 2 the values from 20 are proportional to u and the values from 21 are proportional to 2 in the case when u 2 1 and u 2 u 2 the values from 20 and 21 are proportional to u and u 2 respectively note that in contrast to the dependence on of the magnetic field of a moving electric charge in electrody namics where components of this field are proportional to some above considered gravitomagnetic components can be proportional to and others to 2 iii spin gravity coupling by estimation of an observer comoving with the spinning particle a some general relationships connected with the mp equations we take into account the mp equations in the form 3 4 d ds mu u ds ds 1 2 u s r 22 ds ds u u ds ds u u ds ds 0 23 where u dx ds is the particle s 4 velocity s is the tensor of spin m and d ds are the mass and the covariant derivative along u respectively as usual these equations are considered with some supplementary condition and more often than not either the mathisson pirani condition 3 36 s u 0 24 4 or the tulczyjew dixon one 5 37 s p 0 25 are used where p mu u ds ds 26 is the particle 4 momentum in both 24 and 25 the constant of motion of the mp equations is s 20 1 2 s s 27 where s 0 is the absolute value of spin the value m in the left hand side of eq 22 is the constant of motion under condition 24 the value p p is the constant of motion at condition 25 in recent papers 38 40 instead of eqs 22 and 23 the set of equations m du ds 1 2 u s r 28 ds ds 0 29 dm ds 0 30 is studied and it means that the new ohashi kyrian semera k supplementary condition is used this approach is related to the possibility to exclude the hidden momen tum which is determined by the term u ds ds in the mp equations 22 and 23 other aspects of the supplementary conditions for the mp equations are elucidated for example in 41 42 as it is pointed out in 15 the physical condition for a spinning test particle s 0 mr 1 31 must be taken into account in many papers where condition 24 is used the 4 vector of spin s is taken into account in the mp equa tions instead of the 4 tensor s where by definition s 1 2 g u s 32 g is the determinant of g and is the levi civita symbol under condition 24 it follows from 23 that ds ds s du ds u 33 and it means that the 4 vector of spin is fermi trans ported the relationship s s s 20 holds in addition in practical calculations it is convenient to represent the mp equations through the spin 3 vector si which is de fined by si 1 2 g iklskl 34 the following relationship holds si uis 4 u 4 si 35 at condition 24 the three independent equations of set 23 can be written as u 4 s i u 4 si 2 u 4 ui u u 4 ui sku k 2 sn n 4 ui u 0 36 where a dot denotes the usual differentiation with re spect to the proper time s and square brackets denote antisymmetrization of indices in general the solutions of eqs 22 and 23 under conditions 24 and 25 are different however in the post newtonian approximation these solutions coincide with high accuracy 43 just as in other cases when the spin effects lead to small corrections to the corresponding geodesic expressions therefore instead of rigorous mp eqs 22 their linear spin approximation m d ds u 1 2 u s r 37 is often considered in this approximation condition 25 matches with 24 an important physical consequence follows from eqs 37 after their representation in terms of the local tetrad values which describe the situation when an ob server is comoving with the spinning particle then one can obtain from eqs 37 the relationships 26 31 i 4 4 s 1 m r i 4 2 3 38 where k 1 4 are the ricci coefficients of rotation and here the first local vector 1 is chosen to be oriented along the particle s spin it means that s 2 0 s 3 0 and by the property of the spin 4 vector for a comoving observer s 4 0 14 it is known that value i 4 4 is the dynamical char acteristic of the reference frame namely its acceleration that is according to 38 we have a i s 1 m r i 4 2 3 39 where a i is the 3 acceleration with which the spinning particle deviates from free geodesic fall as measured by the comoving observer taking 3 into account it is easy 5 to see that the right hand side of 39 contains the grav itomagnetic components for comparison we present the relationship which fol lows from the rigorous mp equations 22 under condi tion 24 taking into account the condition of the fermi transport for the local orthogonal vectors i k 4 0 we write this relationship as 31 a 1 s 1 m r 1 4 2 3 40 a 2 s 1 m r 2 4 2 3 a 3 41 a 3 s 1 m r 3 4 2 3 a 2 42 where a dot denotes the usual derivative with respect to s in a particular case of a 2 const and a 3 const eqs 40 42 coincide with eq 39 some correspond ing special examples will be considered below b the acceleration a i in the schwarzschild de sitter background let us consider 39 in the specific case of spinning par ticle motion in the schwarzschild de sitter background when the particle s spin is orthogonal to the plane de termined by the direction of the particle motion and the radial direction we choose the same orientation of the space local axes as in the previous section then by 39 we write a i s 1 m b 1 i 43 because b 1 i 0 all nonzero components b i k are writ ten in 8 we have a 1 0 i e the acceleration is absent in the direction of the spin orientation according to 8 and 43 the nonzero components a 2 and a 3 are a 2 s 1 m 3 mu u r 3 u 4 u 4 1 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 2 44 a 3 s 1 m 3 mu 2 u 4 r 3 u 4 u 4 1 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 2 45 for the absolute value of the acceleration a where a a 2 1 a 2 2 a 2 3 according to 44 45 and 9 we get a 3 m r 2 s 0 mr u 1 u 2 46 in 46 we take into account that s 1 s 0 it follows from the general relationship s s s s s 20 one can check that the vector a is oriented along the radial direction because the scalar product of a and the tan gentially directed vector e 3 is equal to 0 indeed a a 2 e 2 a 3 e 3 then a e 3 a 2 e 2 a 3 e 3 e 3 a 2 2 3 a 3 3 3 g 33 a 2 3 2 a 2 3 2 47 using expressions 5 44 and 45 we obtain that the value in the last brackets of 47 is equal to 0 we also emphasize that the value of acceleration 46 does not depend on the radial component of the particle velocity u and depends significantly on its tangential velocity u that is expression 46 shows the essential difference between the two cases when 1 u 1 the weak relativistic motion and 2 u 1 the highly relativistic motion in the first case after 46 we write a 3 m r 2 48 where the small value is determined in 31 and u 1 note that m r 2 is equal to the newtonian acceleration of free fall which is caused by a body with the mass m according to 48 the acceleration of a spinning particle is much less than the newtonian value m r 2 whereas in the second case by 46 we have a 3 m r 2 2 49 where is the lorentz factor calculated by the tangential velocity u expression 49 shows that for any small value one can choose such the high values which would lead to a m r 2 note that expression 46 is common for schwarzschild s and the schwarzschild de sitter back ground and the role of the can be revealed by consideration of the dependence of u on for specific spinning particle motions naturally it is important to study the cases of motions which can be described in some clear analytic expressions if it is possible for this purpose in the next section we consider the circular orbits of a spinning particle when u 0 and u 6 0 in this context we note that on the circular orbits with u const expression 38 is rigorous in contrast to the noncircular orbits when 38 is within the linear spin approximation in the following we will consider rigorous mp equations 22 and 23 under condition 24 iv highly relativistic circular orbits of a spinning particle in the schwarzschild de sitter spacetime first note that by the geodesic equations in metric 1 circular orbits of a spinless particle the schwarzschild de 6 sitter spacetime are allowed when its orbital tangential 4 velocity u satisfies the relationship u 2 m r 3 r 2 1 3 m r 1 50 it follows from 50 that under the condition m r 3 r 2 51 circular orbits exist for r 3 m similarly as for schwarzschild s spacetime and the orbit with r 3 m is the so called orbit of a photon the circular orbits are highly relativistic only at r 3 m 1 where 0 1 i e in a small neighborhood of the value 3 m note that the right hand side of 50 is also posi tive when m r 3 r 2 r 3 m 52 however it follows from 52 that then g 44 0 i e then the meaning of the coordinate t is changed now we take into account the mp equations 22 and 23 with supplementary condition 24 because in gen eral for a correct description of highly relativistic mo tions of a spinning particle this condition is more appro priate than condition 25 30 32 some points pertain ing to the issue of choosing different supplementary con ditions are discussed below in subsection a it is easy to check by direct calculations that in the case when spin is orthogonal to the plane 2 in metric 1 i e when s 1 sr 0 s 3 s 0 and only s 2 s is nonzero eqs 22 24 in this metric have solutions which de scribe the circular orbits of a spinning particle in the plane 2 according to these solutions there is the connection between the nonzero components of the par ticle 4 velocity u 3 u 4 and the component of the 3 vector of spin s 2 r u 3 u 3 m r 3 3 u 4 u 4 1 1 3 m r 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 u 3 s 2 mr 3 m r 3 u 3 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 s 2 mr 53 relationship 53 follows directly from the first equation from 22 with 1 in addition to 53 it is necessary to take into account the relationship for u 3 and u 4 r 2 u 3 u 3 1 2 m r r 2 3 u 4 u 4 1 54 which is a direct consequence of the general relationship u u 1 from 53 and 54 we obtain the third order algebraic equation for u u 3 1 3 m r 2 s 2 mr 2 u 2 1 3 m r 1 2 m r r 2 3 u s 2 mr 2 m r 2 3 m r r 2 3 1 6 m r m r r 2 3 1 2 m r r 2 3 0 55 which determines the dependence of the spinning parti cle velocity on r m and s 2 without any loss in generality we can put s 2 0 by the way the set of equations for the spin 3 vector 36 becomes much sim pler when spin is orthogonal to the trajectory of motion siu i 0 u 4 s i u 4 si 2 sn n 4 ui u 0 56 in our case of particle motions in the equatorial plane of the schwarzschild de sitter metric with s 1 0 and s 3 0 the single nontrivial equation from 56 with i 2 can be easily integrated as a result we have s 2 ru 4 s 0 57 a the case r 3 m in the particular case when r 3 m equation 55 becomes linear for u and we have u 3 mm 2 s 2 1 9 m 2 58 without any loss in generality we can put s 2 0 then after 57 using 54 we rewrite 58 in the form u 1 3 3 m 2 1 4 1 1 4 1 3 3 m 2 1 2 59 where is determined in 31 it follows from 31 and 59 that u 2 1 60 and it means that for the motion on the circular orbit with r 3 m the spinning particle must posses a highly relativistic velocity there are two points here worth drawing our attention to the first one is that the term in the left hand side of 53 1 3 m r 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 u 3 s 2 mr 61 7 is determined just by the term u ds ds 62 from the left hand side of 22 and in the right hand side of 26 the second one is that for the considered cir cular orbit with r 3 m both term 61 and 62 are equal to 0 they allow us to make a conclusion that partial solution 58 of the the mp equations in the schwarzschild de sitter background which describes the highly relativistic circular orbit with r 3 m is com mon under the mathisson pirani tulczyjew dixon and ohashi kyrian semera k conditions from this point this solution is unique nevertheless it cannot be excluded that the mp equations may have some other solutions that describe noncircular highly relativistic orbits and that are the same or close under different supplemen tary conditions with this in mind it should also be noted that in order to describe motion of a spinning par ticle correctly any partial solution of the mp equations which is obtained under some supplementary condition other than the mathisson pirani one has to be the same or very close to the corresponding nonhelical solution of the mp equations under the mathisson pirani condition this point is elucidated in 30 31 it is appropriate to compare solution 58 with the well known circular solutions of the exact mp equations under condition 24 in the minkowski spacetime from eq 58 in the case of m 0 and 0 we have u mr 2 s 2 63 circular solution 63 represents a partial case of the general helical solutions which have eqs 22 24 in the minkowski spacetime as it can easily be seen expres sions 58 and 63 have different signs for the fixed sign of s 2 it means that the directions of the rotation accord ing to 58 and 63 are opposite and that the circular orbit 58 cannot be interpreted as the one which is anal ogous to the orbits with 63 eq 63 does not follow from eq 58 when m tends to 0 for 0 b the case r 3 m m r r 2 3 0 in this case the cubic eq 55 has the single real root which is u 3 m r 1 1 2 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 4 1 1 k 64 where k c d 1 4 1 3 m r 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 2 65 c m r r 2 3 m r 5 12 m r r 2 3 2 3 m r 3 m r 2 3 m r r 2 3 1 6 m r 2 m r 4 3 m r 18 m 2 r 2 r 2 3 2 33 m r 72 m 2 r 2 2 r 4 3 2 3 m r d 54 1 3 m r 3 m r r 2 3 3 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 2 and these expressions are written for the case when 1 3 m r 3 1 i e when r is not very close to 3 m similarly to the case with r 3 m here the value u is proportional to 1 and u 0 for the chosen positive sign of s 2 note that the case of highly relativistic circular orbits with r 3 m in schwarzschild s background was under inves tigation in 28 30 it was shown that these orbits exist due to the strong coupling of spin with the gravitational field and the force of this coupling acts on a particle as a repulsive one 30 it is known that a spinless par ticle which starts in the tangential direction relative to schwarzschild s mass with any velocity from the posi tion r 3 m falls on the horizon surface the specific feature of the schwarzschild de sitter background is the property that the constant 0 describes the cosmolog ical repulsion according to 64 the presence of 0 in the right hand side of 64 leads to less absolute value of the tangential velocity and the corresponding factor which is necessary for the realization of the circular or bits with some fixed r 3 m than it is necessary in schwarzschild s background as it is noted above the case r 3 m m r r 2 3 0 means that g 44 0 c the case r 3 m m r r 2 3 0 under these conditions eq 55 has three real roots for u which can be written as u 1 3 m r 1 2 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 4 8 1 1 k 66 u 1 2 m r 3 r 2 1 2 1 3 m r 1 2 1 67 where the expression for k is the same as in 65 and the expression for is 3 m 2 r 1 3 m r 1 1 2 m r r 2 3 m r 3 r 2 1 2 68 concerning eq 66 we note that in contrast to expres sion 64 the sign of u in 66 is positive for the positive sign of s 2 in the particular case of schwarzschild s back ground 0 the analogous to 66 expression was considered in 30 and it was pointed out that the corre sponding highly relativistic circular orbits at r 3 m are caused by the strong attractive action of the spin gravity coupling if 6 0 the second bracket in the right hand side of eq 66 shows the influence of on the necessary value of u for the realization of these orbits relationship 67 describes a simple situation of circu lar motions of a spinning particle which are close to the corresponding geodesic motions in this context see eq 50 i e when the influence of the particle s spin on its orbital velocity u is weak d the case r 3 m m r r 2 3 0 this case does not have an analogy in schwarzschild s background and then eq 55 has the single real positive root for u u 1 3 m r 1 2 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 4 1 1 k 69 where the expression for k is the same as in 65 the corresponding circular orbits of a spinning particle exist because of the attractive action of the spin gravity cou pling for comparison note that according to 50 any circular orbits of a spinless particle are possible at the conditions r 3 m m r r 2 3 it is important to emphasize that from 59 64 66 and 69 we can see that for corresponding circular orbits of a spinning particle the absolute values of u are pro portional to 1 and by 31 the relationship u 2 1 takes place then in this context we point out that ac cording to 49 the value of the acceleration a is of order m r 2 now there are several remarks regarding the possibil ity of interpreting the highly relativistic circular solutions which are described by 59 64 66 and 69 as cor responding to the partial case of helical solutions first let us take into account eqs 41 and 42 the general solution of these equations is a 2 s s 0 m s 0 r 3 4 2 3 m s 0 r 2 4 2 3 sin m s 0 s x dx a 2 0 cos m s 0 a 3 0 s 0 m r 3 4 2 3 0 sin m s 0 s 70 a 3 s s 0 m s 0 r 2 4 2 3 m s 0 r 3 4 2 3 sin m s 0 s x dx a 3 0 cos m s 0 s a 2 0 s 0 m r 2 4 2 3 0 sin m s 0 s 71 where a 2 0 and a 3 0 are the corresponding values at s 0 in the simple case of the minkowski spacetime it follows from 70 and 71 that a 2 s a 2 0 cos m s 0 s a 3 0 sin m s 0 s 72 a 3 s a 3 0 cos m s 0 s a 3 0 sin m s 0 s 73 as it can easily be seen the expressions for a 2 s and a 3 s in 72 and 73 do not contain oscillatory terms if and only if a 2 0 0 and a 3 0 0 when one of the values a 2 0 and a 3 0 or both of them are nonzero eqs describe the known oscillatory solutions it gets more interesting when we investigate some spe cial solutions of the strict mp equations 22 and 23 under condition 24 in a spacetime with some nonzero curvature indeed let us suppose that we obtained a par tial solution of these equations in a certain background theoretically after calculations of comoving tetrad com ponents we can obtain explicit expressions of r 2 4 2 3 9 and r 3 4 2 3 as functions of s then by performing cor responding integration in the right hand side of eqs 70 and 71 explicit expressions for a 2 s and a 3 s can be written in eqs 70 and 71 a 2 0 and a 3 0 are the constants of integration and different numeri cal values of a 2 0 and a 3 0 correspond to different types of particle motions both oscillatory and nonoscil latory as a result due to the obtained expressions for eqs 70 and 71 it is possible to identify the par tial solution of the mp equations under condition 24 as the one which describes some helical or nonhelical motion it is appropriate to illustrate this procedure with considered above highly relativistic circular orbits in schwarzschild de sitter background for this purpose we take into account that according to eqs 5 and 6 all components r are constant on circular or bits because in this case u 1 0 u 3 const u 4 const and r const we also note that in this case the relation ship i k 4 0 is satisfied then the integrals in the right hand side of eqs 70 and 71 can be calculated easily and we obtain a 2 s r 2 4 2 3 s 0 m 1 cos m s 0 s r 3 4 2 3 s 0 m sin m s 0 s a 2 0 cos m s 0 s a 3 0 sin m s 0 s 74 a 3 s r 3 4 2 3 s 0 m 1 cos m s 0 s r 2 4 2 3 s 0 m sin m s 0 s a 3 0 cos m s 0 s a 2 0 sin m s 0 s 75 it follows from eqs 74 and 75 that the oscillatory terms in the right hand sides of these equations can be excluded if and only if the values a 2 0 and a 3 0 are a 2 0 s 0 m r 2 4 2 3 a 3 0 s 0 m r 3 4 2 3 76 note that these values coincide with the constant values of a 2 and a 3 on the circular orbits which were consid ered above the behavior of a spinning particle in the schwarzschild de sitter background was investigated in 21 23 without focusing just on specific cases of highly relativistic motions in 21 the stationary equi librium condition for a spinning particle located in the schwarzschild de sitter background was studied using the mp equations with relationship 24 this condition is m r r 2 3 and then the gravitational attraction is compensated by the cosmological repulsion the mp equations with con dition 25 were studied in 22 to find the location of the turning points when a spinning particle is moving in the equatorial plane of the schwarzschild de sitter metric the specific case with the isofrequency pairing of spin ning particles in the schwarzschild de sitter background was investigated by the mp equations under condition 25 v conclusions the above considered situations with highly relativis tic motions of a spinning particle in the schwarzschild de sitter background give the new theoretical data concern ing physical effects following from general relativity at the same time it is useful to take into account the cor responding results in the practical high energy physics astrophysics and cosmology for understanding the physical reason which deter mines the specific features of highly relativistic motions of a spinning particle in the schwarzschild de sitter back ground it is important to keep in mind that in the proper system of reference such a particle feels the strong action of the gravitomagnetic field as it is estimated in secs ii and iii this action is repulsive or attractive depending on the correlation between the particle s spin and orbital velocity the corresponding examples are presented in sec iv for highly relativistic circular orbits 1 c w misner k s thorne and j a wheeler gravi tation freeman san francisko 1973 2 s chandrasekhar the mathematical theory of
