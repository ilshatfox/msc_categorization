positive constant 1 2 are positive cou pling constants and the other symbols should be self evident the existence of the time variable and its range is due to the quantization process 1 1 remark for the results and arguments in that paper it was com pletely irrelevant that the values of the higgs field lie in a lie algebra i e could also be just an arbitrary scalar field or we could consider a higgs field as well as an another arbitrary scalar field hence let us stipulate that the higgs field could also be just an arbitrary scalar field if s 0 is compact we also proved a spectral resolution of equation 1 1 by first considering a stationary version of the hyperbolic equation namely the elliptic eigenvalue equation 1 3 n 1 v n 2 rv 1 n 8 fijf ijv 2 n 4 ab ij ai b iv 2 n 2 mv v v it has countably many solutions vi i such that 1 4 0 1 2 1 5 lim i let v be an eigenfunction with eigenvalue 0 then we looked at solutions of 1 1 of the form 1 6 u x t w t v x u is then a solution of 1 1 provided w satisfies the implicit eigenvalue equa tion 1 7 1 32 n 2 n 1 w t 2 4 nw nt 2 w 0 where is the eigenvalue this eigenvalue problem we also considered in a previous paper and proved that it has countably many solutions wi i with finite energy i e 1 8 0 w i 2 1 t 2 t 2 4 n wi 2 more precisely we proved cf 2 theorem 6 7 a complete set of eigendistributions 3 1 2 theorem assume n 2 and s 0 to be compact and let v be a solution of the eigenvalue problem 1 3 with 0 then there exist countably many solutions wi i of the implicit eigenvalue problem 1 7 such that 1 9 i i 1 0 1 10 lim i i 0 and such that the functions 1 11 ui wiv are solutions of the wave equation 1 1 the transformed eigenfunctions 1 12 w i t wi n 4 n 1 i t where 1 13 i i n 1 n form a basis of l 2 r c and also of the hilbert space h defined as the completion of c c r c under the norm of the scalar product 1 14 w w 1 0 w w t 2 w w where a prime or a dot denotes differentiation with respect to t in this paper we want to extend this spectral resolution to the case when s 0 is non compact denote by a the elliptic differential operator on the left hand side of 1 3 then assuming that its coefficients are smooth with bounded cm norms for any m n we have a self adjoint operator in h l 2 s 0 and a gelfand triplet 1 15 s h s such that we can apply the nuclear spectral theorem of gelfand maurin lead ing to a complete set of eigendistributions 1 16 f s of a where is a measure space for almost every we have 0 6 f and f is a solution of the eigenvalue equation 1 17 af a f where 1 18 a a is a measurable function having a as its essential range since the f are distributions and a is uniformly elliptic and smooth the f are also smooth and since they are also tempered distributions we could prove that the eigenvalues satisfy 1 19 a 0 4 claus gerhardt for a e hence the separation of variables described in 1 6 can be applied with an eigenfunction v be replaced by an eigendistribution f since all eigenvalues a are strictly positive this can be considered to be a spectral resolution of the wave equation the smooth functions 1 20 ui wif are classical solutions of the wave equation 1 1 with bounded temporal energy and locally bounded spatial energy 2 the nuclear spectral theorem we assume that s 0 ij is complete and that there exists a compact subset k 0 s 0 and a chart u 0 x such that 2 1 s 0 k 0 u 0 and 2 2 0 x u 0 r n b r 0 0 moreover we require 2 1 assumption i the metric ij and the lower order coefficients of the elliptic operator on the left hand side of equation of the equation 1 3 on page 2 are smooth with bounded cm norms for any m n we call the elliptic operator a ii the metric ij is uniformly elliptic the last assumption implies that the radial distance from a center x 0 k 0 2 3 r x d x x 0 and the euclidean distance x are equivalent in 0 i e there are constants c 1 c 2 such that 2 4 r x c 1 x c 2 r x x 0 and hence the schwartz space of rapidly decreasing test functions in s 0 can be identified with the schwartz space in rn we shall denote the schwartz space by 2 5 s s s 0 and its dual space the tempered distributions by 2 6 s s s 0 the topology of s is defined by a sequence of norms 2 7 m k sup x s 0 1 r x 2 k m d x s is a fre chet space and also a nuclear space cf 8 example 5 p 107 the differential operator a defined by the left hand side of 1 3 on page 2 is a a complete set of eigendistributions 5 continuous map from s into s in view of assumption 2 1 a is a self adjoint linear operator in l 2 s 0 c and 2 8 s d a a dense subspace by duality a can also be defined on the dual space s namely let f s then 2 9 af f a s where the self adjointness of a has been used 2 2 definition f s is said to be an eigendistribution of a with eigenvalue r i e 2 10 af f iff 2 11 af f s or equivalently iff 2 12 f a f s a setting where we have a self adjoint operator a in a separable hilbert space h a dense subspace 2 13 e h which is also a nuclear space in a finer topology with dual space e such that 2 14 e h e where the imbedding of e into h is continuous a property which we already specified by speaking of a finer topology and where moreover 2 15 a e e is continuous is known as a rigged hilbert space setting though usually e is replaced by the space of antilinear functionals however since we do not use dirac s ket notation we shall consider e in such a framework a nuclear spectral theorem has been proved by gelfand and maurin cf 1 theorem 5 p 126 5 satz 2 and 6 chap xviii p 333 which we shall formulate and prove for a single self adjoint operator a and not for a family of strongly commuting operators the proof closely follows the one given by maurin in 5 satz 2 since this paper is writ ten in german we like to include a proof for the convenience of the reader 2 3 theorem maurin let h be a separable complex hilbert space a a densely defined self adjoint operator e h a dense subspace which also carries topology such that it is a nuclear space and assume that the imbedding 6 claus gerhardt in 2 13 and the map a in 2 15 are continuous then there exists a locally compact measure space a finite positive measure a measurable function 2 16 a a r and a unitary operator 2 17 u h l 2 c such that if we set 2 18 u uu u h 2 19 a uau 1 we have 2 20 u d a au l 2 2 21 a u au u d a and for a e the mapping 2 22 f e c is continuous in e and does not vanish identically i e 2 23 0 6 f e and hence 2 24 f e moreover 2 21 implies 2 25 f a a a a f e for a e or equivalently 2 26 af a f for a e the generalized eigenvectors f are complete since 2 27 2 2 2 d e and hence 2 28 0 for a e is equivalent to 0 proof the first part of the theorem is due to the multiplicative form of the spectral theorem cf 7 theorem viii 4 p 260 let us remark that we used a different version of von neumann s spectral theorem than maurin which simplifies the proof slightly especially the completeness part note that the spectrum 2 29 a a is the essential range of a a complete set of eigendistributions 7 to prove 2 22 and the following claims we observe that the imbedding 2 30 j e h is continuous and therefore also nuclear hence there is a semi norm p on e sequences uk h fk e such that 2 31 j k fk uk e and 2 32 k fk p uk k fk p u k where p is the dual norm in e 2 33 fk p sup p 1 fk we shall show that the mapping in 2 30 which when composed with u can now be expressed as 2 34 k fk u k is continuous in e and not identically 0 for a e indeed without loss of generality we may assume 2 35 uk 1 to deduce from 2 32 2 36 k fk p k fk p uk k fk p uk 2 k fk p u k 2 k fk p u k 2 hence 2 37 k fk p u k 2 c 1 2 for a e and 2 38 c 1 l 2 8 claus gerhardt to prove 2 22 we now estimate 2 39 2 k fk u k 2 k fk p p u k 2 k fk 1 2 p p fk 1 2 p u k 2 k fk p 2 p k fk p u k 2 c 1 2 k fk p 2 p in view of 2 36 and 2 37 the fact that the mapping in 2 34 does not vanish identically for a e is proved in the lemma below this completes the proof of the theorem since the other properties are evident 2 4 lemma the mapping 2 34 does not vanish identically in e for a e proof we argue by contradiction and assume that there exists a measurable set 0 with positive measure such that 2 40 0 0 e let 0 be the characteristic function of 0 and set 2 41 u 0 u 1 0 then 2 42 0 6 u 0 h let k e be sequence converging to u 0 then 2 43 u 0 2 lim k k u 0 lim k k 0 0 a contradiction 3 the eigendistributions are smooth functions in our case e s and a is a uniformly elliptic linear differential operator with smooth coefficients hence we can prove 3 1 theorem let a satisfy the assumption 2 1 on page 4 then the solutions f s of the eigenvalue problem 3 1 af f belong to c s 0 and for each m n and r 0 f can be estimated by 3 2 f m br x 0 cmr n f p a complete set of eigendistributions 9 where p is one of the defining norms in s such that 3 3 f p sup p 1 f and n depends on n p a and s 0 while cm depends on m a the eigenvalue and on s 0 br x 0 is a geodesic ball of radius r for a fixed x 0 k 0 s 0 proof first we note that we can absorb the right hand side of the eigenvalue equation into the left hand side and simply consider the equation 3 4 af 0 hence it is well known that the distributional solutions is smooth and equa tion 3 4 can be understood in the classical sense see e g 4 theorem 3 2 p 125 the important estimate 3 2 is due to the fact that f is a tempered distribution since f s we have 3 5 f c sup x s 0 1 r x 2 k m 0 d x c p and the dual norm 3 6 f p c to prove 3 2 we fix m n and assume that 3 7 f m br 1 x 0 c 0 for some sufficiently large radius r 1 such that we only have to prove the estimate in the domain 3 8 br 0 b r 0 0 where we now consider euclidean balls cf the assumptions in 2 1 and 2 2 on page 4 hence we may consider equation 3 4 to be a uniformly elliptic equation in an exterior region of euclidean space with smooth coefficients let r r 0 then we first prove a priori estimates for f in smalls balls 3 9 b y b 2 r 0 br 0 0 where 3 10 2 0 1 and 0 is fixed let 3 11 h m 2 0 m n be the usual sobolev spaces where 3 12 rn 10 claus gerhardt is an open set to be defined as the completion of c c under the norm 3 13 2 m 2 m d 2 h m 2 0 is a hilbert space its dual space is denoted by 3 14 h m 2 and its elements are the distributions f d which can be written in the form 3 15 f m d u where 3 16 u l 2 and the dual norm of f is equal to 3 17 f m 2 m u 2 2 1 2 the sobolev imbedding theorem states that 3 18 m n 2 h m 2 0 c 0 such that 3 19 u 0 c u m 2 u h m 2 0 where c only depends on m and n as a corollary we deduce 3 20 m n 2 h m m 0 2 0 c m 0 0 with a corresponding estimate 3 21 u m 0 0 c u m m 0 2 where c c n m m 0 hence for any ball 3 22 b 0 y b 2 r 0 f can be considered to belong to 3 23 f h m 0 n 2 b 0 y with norm 3 24 f n m 0 2 cr 2 k in view of the estimate 3 5 where we also assume r 0 1 the constant c depends on n m 0 k and the constant in 3 5 from the proofs of 4 theorem 3 1 p 123 and 4 theorem 3 2 p 125 we then deduce that for any m n there exists 0 depending only on a complete set of eigendistributions 11 the lipschitz constant of the metric ij m n and m 0 such that the c m norm of the solution f of equation 3 4 can be estimated by 3 25 f m b y c r 2 k where c also depends on the c m norms of the coefficients of a and on the ellipticity constants now 3 26 4 r n 2 n n balls 3 27 b y b 2 r 0 cover the closed ball b r 0 hence we conclude 3 28 f m br 0 k 0 cr 2 k n where c c m m 0 n a 4 the positivity of the eigenvalues to apply the separation of variables method to find a complete set of eigensolutions for the wave equation the eigenvalues of the elliptic operator have to be positive in this section we shall prove that eigenvalues of the eigenvalue equation 3 1 on page 8 are always strictly positive provided some rather weak assumptions are satisfied let us start with the following lemma 4 1 lemma let a be the differential operator on the left hand side of 1 3 on page 2 and let us write the operator in the form 4 1 av n 1 v n 2 rv gv 2 n 2 mv v where 4 2 0 g 1 n 8 fijf ij 2 n 2 ab ij ai b j assume there are positive constants 0 m 0 and r 1 such that 4 3 n 2 r g 2 n 2 m 0 v 0 r 2 x br 1 x 0 where x 0 k 0 is fixed and r is the geodesic distance to x 0 then there exists m 1 m 0 such that for all m m 1 the quadratic form of a satisfies 4 4 br 1 x 0 u 2 au u u h 1 2 s 0 provided 4 5 v 0 a e in s 0 12 claus gerhardt proof the ball br 1 x 0 is bounded hence the imbedding of 4 6 h 1 2 br 1 x 0 l 2 br 1 x 0 is compact and we can apply a compactness lemma to conclude that for any 0 there is a constant c such that 4 7 br 1 x 0 u 2 br 1 x 0 du 2 c br 1 x 0 v u 2 for all u h 1 2 br 1 x 0 in view of the assumption 4 5 cf 3 lemma 7 5 hence we deduce 4 8 br 1 x 0 u 2 n 1 br 1 x 0 du 2 br 1 x 0 n 2 r g u 2 2 n 2 m br 1 x 0 v u 2 for all u h 1 2 br 1 x 0 provided m is sufficiently large 4 9 m m 1 choosing m 1 m 0 completes the proof of the lemma because of the assump tion 4 3 4 2 theorem under the assumptions of the preceding lemma and the general provisions in 2 1 2 2 and assumption 2 1 on page 4 the eigenvalue equation 3 1 on page 8 is only solvable if 0 proof since the quadratic form of a is positive we immediately infer 4 10 a r hence the eigenvalue in 3 1 has to satisfy 4 11 0 so that we have to exclude the case 4 12 0 we argue by contradiction let 4 13 f s c s 0 be a solution of 4 14 af 0 then we shall prove 4 15 f 0 let k n and r r 1 be large and let be defined by 4 16 x r k x r x k x r a complete set of eigendistributions 13 then 4 17 f 2 h 1 2 s 0 in view of the estimate 3 2 on page 8 which can be rephrased to 4 18 m d f x cm x n x r 0 here we use the euclidean distance multiplying 4 14 by f 2 and integrating by parts yields 4 19 0 s 0 n 1 df 2 2 n 2 r f 2 g f 2 2 n 2 m f 2 2 n 1 s 0 br 1 x 0 2 df f d br n 1 df 2 n 2 r f 2 g f 2 2 n 2 m f 2 r 2 k s 0 br 0 x 2 c x 2 f 2 2 where c is a fixed constant depending only on the metric ij and k the first integral is strictly positive unless f vanishes in br x 0 and the difference in the braces is also strictly positive if r is large enough hence we conclude 4 20 f 0 we can now prove a spectral resolution of the hyperbolic equation 1 1 on page 1 by choosing an eigendistribution f f with eigenvalue a and look at solutions of 1 1 of the form 4 21 u x t w t f x u is then a solution of 1 1 provided w satisfies the implicit eigenvalue equa tion 4 22 1 32 n 2 n 1 w t 2 4 nw nt 2 w 0 where is the eigenvalue this eigenvalue problem we also considered in a previous paper and proved that it has countably many solutions wi i with finite energy i e 4 23 0 w i 2 1 t 2 t 2 4 n wi 2 cf 2 theorem 6 7 we can then extend the spectral resolution which we proved in 3 the orem 1 7 for a compact cauchy hypersurface s 0 to the case when s 0 is non compact 14 claus gerhardt 4 3 theorem assume n 2 and let s 0 and the elliptic differential oper ator a satisfy the assumptions of the theorem 4 2 pick any solution f of the eigenvalue problem 3 1 then there exist countably many solutions wi i of the implicit eigenvalue problem 4 22 such that 4 24 i i 1 0 4 25 lim i i 0 and such that the functions 4 26 ui wif are solutions of the wave equations 1 1 on page 1 the transformed eigen functions 4 27 w i t wi n 4 n 1 i t where 4 28 i i n 1 n form a basis of l 2 r c and also of the hilbert space h defined as the completion of c c r c under the norm of the scalar product 4 29 w w 1 0 w w t 2 w w where a prime or a dot denotes differentiation with respect to t 4 4 remark this result is the best we can achieve under the present assumptions in order to prove a mass gap i e prove an estimate of the form 4 30 0 0 for ally eigenvalues of the eigenvalue equation 3 1 on page 8 we have to strengthen our assumptions on the zero order terms instead of the assump tion 4 3 we have to require 4 31 n 2 r g 2 n 2 m 0 v 0 0 x br 1 x 0 then we immediately would derive a mass gap an even stronger estimate of the form 4 32 n 2 r g 2 n 2 m 0 v 0 r x br 1 x 0 with 0 would yield that the operatora would have a pure point spectrum since the quadratic form 4 33 au u would then be compact relative to the l 2 scalar product and we would be in the same situation as if s 0 would be compact a complete set of eigendistributions 15 references 1 i m gel fand and n ya vilenkin generalized
