reaction diffusion equation whose diffusivity is a non linear functional of the boundary temperature we do this by studying systems of one dimensional reflecting diffusions whose noise is a function of the reflection local time of the system and by characterizing the large scale hydrodynamic behavior by showing propagation of chaos in addition we analyze the one particle case by computing the distribution of the hitting times of its reflection local time this work is the noise analog of work done by frank knight 2001 contents 1 introduction 1 1 1 description of model 1 1 2 free boundary

surely for all t 0 t and i 1 n x n i t x n i 0 l n i t t 0 l n s dbi s 0 l n t 1 n n i 1 l n i t l n i t is the local time of x n i at zero at time t 1 informally x n 1 x n n are one dimensional reflecting diffusions whose diffusiv ity depends on the collected reflection local time consequently the n diffu sions are coupled together through the diffusivity function if is constant then x n 1 x n n are independent but are dependent otherwise for instance if one of the particles has an unusually large reflection local time this will alter the oscil lations of the other particles we determine the limiting behavior of the empirical process n t n i 1 x n i t as the unique solution to the reaction diffusion equation 2 5 by proving propaga tion of chaos for the system see theorem 1 3 often one appeals to known results in the pde literature that guarantees uniqueness of limiting pde however this does not seem to be covered in the case of our non linear free boundary problem in this article we show existence and uniqueness of the pde using a stochastic representation theorem see section 5 1 2 free boundary problem let f x 0 be a probability density supported on 0 consider the following non linear equation for q q t x t 1 2 2 t xq t x x 0 2 q t 0 x 0 3 t 1 2 t 0 q s 0 2 s ds 4 lim t 0 q t dx f dx 5 we think of q t x as the temperature at time space location t x here 3 is the neumann boundary condition which is equivalent to the boundary point at zero being a perfect insulator so that heat is conserved in the system because the initial condition u 0 x f x is a density q t defines a probability density for any t 0 and 5 means the distribution defined by q t dx converges to the distribution defined by the initial condition f as t 0 the relations 2 and 4 imply diffusions with local time dependent noise 3 the diffusivity of heat 2 t is a non linear functional of the past temperature at the insulator q s 0 if such a solution exists it follows automatically from 4 that t is differentiable note that the pde problem above is for the pair q and is consequently non linear because of the interaction between the diffusivity and the insulator s temperature temperature at insulator equation 4 diffusivity of heat in proving well posedness for the above free boundary problem we arrive at a stochastic represenation for both q t x and and give an example where this can be used to solve for explicitly 1 3 main results theorem 1 1 there exists a unique classical solution to the free boundary problem in subsection 1 2 theorem 1 2 strong existence and uniqueness of particle system let 0 0 be lipschitz n n and p ft t 0 a probability space supporting n i i d ft brownian motions there continuous ft adapted processes x n 1 x n n l n 1 l n n satisfying 1 for t 0 t such a solution is pathwise unique let p r be the space of probability measures on r equipped with the weak topology notice that the system x n 1 x n n is exchangeable in the sense that the law does not depend on the labeling for such systems propagation of chaos is equivalent to convergence in law of the empirical process n when it is viewed as a p r valued process the distributional limit of n is the deterministic p r valued process concentrated on the transition density of x 1 constructed in theorem 1 3 for fixed t n t 1 n n i 1 x n i t is a random probability measure on r because each x n i is continuous n t t 0 t is a continuous p r valued stochastic process therefore n induces a distribution on c 0 t p r with the metric of weak convergence placed on p r the hydrodynamic limit theorem 4 9 characterizes the distributional limit as n approaches infinity see section 4 1 for more details and me leard 19 theorem 1 3 propagation of chaos assume x n i 0 w 1 xi 0 where w 1 is the wasserstein metric and xi 0 i n are i i d samples of a non negative ran dom variable independent of the brownian motions bi i n then for any k x n 1 x n k converges in distribution to a k tuple of

density of x 1 given in theorem 1 3 the empirical process n converges weakly to q t x dx t 0 t in the space c 0 t p r 1 4 results for one particle in this subsection we describe the basic results for the hitting time distribution of l in the n 1 particle case theorem 1 5 existence and uniqueness let 0 0 have support 0 0 possibly 0 assume that is locally lipschitz on 0 0 then there exists a unique strong solution to y t y 0 l t t 0 l s db s 0 l is the reflection local time of y at zero for all t 0 0 here for any a 0 0 a inf t 0 l t a is the hitting time of l at level a assuming the initial condition y 0 is independent of the brownian motion b the distribution of a has laplace transform given by e exp 2 y 0 exp 2 a 0 ds s furthermore 0 almost surely if 0 0 ds s 0 almost surely if 0 0 ds s in particular when y 0 0 the distribution of 0 is determined by its laplace transform e e 0 exp 2 0 0 ds s remark 1 strong existence and uniqueness of processes similar to 9 reflecting in an orthant follow from dupuis and ishii s work 6 to see this consider the higher dimensional process x x 1 x 2 reflecting in g r 0 r in the direction 1 1 let ij be degenerate in the bottom row 21 0 22 in this way the second component x 2 becomes the local time of x 1 and one can write x 1 as a reflected diffusion depending on its local time x 2 we prove theorem 1 5 from an approximation method which in addition gives us tools for studying the hitting times of l example 1 x 1 x p 1 0 x in this example the noise decreases as a power p 0 of the local time s proximity to one if 0 p 1 then 1 almost surely and the noise will almost surely disappear while 1 almost surely if p 1 diffusions with local time dependent noise 5 1 5 outline in section 2 we construct a map f 7 xf l via an approximation method for the one particle case n 1 of 1 that is we construct the following integral system for any f c 0 t when is a non negative lipschitz function bounded away from zero such that xf t l t 0 for all t 0 t xf t xf s l s t s if l is flat on s t 8 where t 7 l t is a nondecreasing continuous function that is flat off the set s xf s l s 0 we construct the pair y l by replacing f in 8 pathwise with brownian motion in section 3 we prove theorem 1 5 by applying results obtained in section 2 that allow us to characterize the hitting times of l in section 4 we prove the propagation of chaos theorem 1 3 in general processes that interact through their local times are hard to study because the correlation structure between the particles is difficult to analyze in our approach we study the large scale behavior of hitting times for the local time of the system l n showing that it becomes deterministic in the limit see propostition 4 7 see 20 where the authors study systems of one dimensional particles interacting through hitting times we conclude with section 5 where we demonstrate existence and uniqueness for the free boundary problem described in subsection 1 2 existence follows from a stochastic representation that is the solution of the pde is the transition density of the limiting process for a fixed particle of the system as described in the statement of propagation of chaos uniqueness of the pde is demonstrated by first showing uniqueness of the diffusivity function t which is done by a coupling argument 1 6 background historically the study of macroscopic behavior for systems of randomly interacting particles began in 1956 by kac 14 and continued with mck ean 18 in 1969 this was followed by fundamental contributions during the 1980 s by sznitman 24 25 tanaka 26 ga rtner 12 and many others the hydrodynamic limit of a system of interacting particles is sometimes referred to as the macroscopic behavior of the system or the asymptotic behavior of the empirical measures such a result is closely related to propagation of chaos and the two are equivalent when the system of interacting particles satisfies an exchangability condition 24 25 19 for a history of hydrodynamic limits see 13 and 4 systems of randomly interact ing particles are probabilistic models originally motivated by statistical mechanics and statistical thermodynamics particularly the theory explored by maxwell boltz mann and vlasov who describe the deterministic evolution of the distribution of gas a good review of interacting particle systems of the mckean vlasov type is found in me le ard 19 fan 7 shows that a reflection term for a random walk reflecting inside a discretiza tion of a sufficiently smooth domain will approximate the local time of reflected brownian motion we mention that our results also give a discrete approximation scheme for solutions to 9 6 clayton barnes there is a large variety of interacting particle systems giving rise to many different limiting behaviors see the above mentioned works of tanaka 26 sznitman 25 24 as well as skorohod 23 nadtochiy and shkolnikov 20 chen and fan 4 coghi et al 5 to mention some for models of interacting particles with rank dependence see sarantsev 21 22 karatzas pal and shkolnikov 16 and cabezas et al who study out of equilibrium behavior of particles interacting through their ranks 3 we briefly bring attention to the relatively recent study of stochastic free boundary problems these are essentially spde s with a free boundary see 17 in 1 the author demonstrated hydrodynamic behavior using lipschitz properties of skorohod maps we also employ skorohod maps for constructing the solutions to 1 however the construction of the skorohod maps and their use in demonstrating hydrodynamic behavior is completely different than the methods we use here we use a stochastic representation see remark 6 to prove existence and uniqueness of the free boundary problem without relying on existence and uniqueness theorems from the theory of pdes this is the first existence and uniqueness result for the free boundary problem we study as it seems not to be subsumed by known results in the analysis literature see 8 9 10 for existence and uniqueness for generalizations of the stephan problem because hitting times for the local time process is employed in our proof of the propagation of chaos we include a study of the n 1 case for 1 which is simply a one dimensional reflected diffusions whose noise term depends on the reflection local time for any filtered probability space p ft t 0 satisfying the usual conditions and supporting an ft adapted brownian motion b consider an ft adapted continuous pair y l such that almost surely y t y 0 t 0 l s db s l t 0 for all t 0 t 9 where l is the local time of y at zero and where is non negative and locally lipschitz on its support we show strong existence of such a process and characterize the hitting time distribution for l the process y has a generalized ito tanaka rule which we describe notice that y is not a markov process because its noise depends on its path history however y l is a markov process intuitively y is a process reflected inside 0 whose noise changes upon every contact with the boundary at zero for example if is a strictly decreasing func tion with support 0 0 possibly with 0 the noise of y will lose power upon reflecting because decreases to zero it is conceivable that the noise will completely disappear at some random time 0 inf s l s 0 inf s l s 0 whenever 0 is finite the process y will have lost all noise at time 0 that is we can continuously extend the noise l to be zero from time 0 onward hence we call 0 the time of determinacy we characterize 0 and show it is either a s finite or a s infinite by characterizing the distribution of the hitting times of l in general see theorem 1 5 diffusions with local time dependent noise 7 1 7 definitions we list the following definitions that will be used throughout the paper definition 1 we define the space c 0 t as the set of continuous functions f 0 t r with the metric defined by the uniform norm definition 2 for a function f 0 t r and a set a 0 t define f a sup x a f x similarly we let f t sup t s s t 0 t f t f s be the modulus of continuity of f on 0 t depending on definition 3 we define p r w 1 as the space of probability measures on r together with the wasserstein 1 metric in general n under w 1 if there exists a probability space supporting random variables x and xn n n such that x d xn d n for all n n and xn x almost surely and in l 1 see 27 definition 4 for g c 0 t define mg t min s 0 t g s 0 as the signed running minimum of g below zero we define g x inf t 0 mg t x s where s sup t g t g t as a right continuous inverse of mg and inf it is the unique right continuous inverse on its restricted domain 0 g t definition 5 let 0 t 0 t 1 tk t be a partition of the interval 0 t given another partition 0 x 0 x 1 xm t we define the common refinement of q ti i 0 k and p xi i 0 m to be the partition of 0 t formed from their union a partition q is called finer than another partition q if q q 2 construction of skorohod map for a continuous function f and positive lipschitz function we give a well defined meaning to the following system xf t f 0 t 0 l s df s xf t l t 0 for all t 0 t 10 where t 7 l t is a nondecreasing continuous function that is flat off the set s xf s l s 0 because l is nondecreasing and continuous it defines a measure on 0 t we show the existence and uniqueness of xf l with the property that 8 clayton barnes for an interval t t on which l does not increase i e the measure induced by l gives zero measure to t t we have xf s xf t l t f s f t for any s t t we use the integral notation in 10 because the increments of xf are the increments of f scaled by l t in such an interval furthermore when f is replaced pathwise by a brownian motion the resulting process xb l l will be a strong solution to the pair y l described in theorem 1 5 we show this in section 3 we construct xf l as a limit of a sequence of approximations x n f l n for a given n n we define the pair x n f l n

and x n f 0 f 0 that x n f n n diffusions with local time dependent noise 13 c 0 f 1 k satisfies the equicontinuity and uniform boundedness criteria of the arzela ascoli theorem proposition 2 6 let p

follows from lemma 2 1 vii and viii corollary 2 7 for any m n n and t 0 f 1 k we have x n f t x m f t i 0 k l n xi l m xi 2 m n f t xi 1 f t xi where xi is the partition of 0 f 1 k formed from the common refinement of t n i and t m i proof apply proposition 2 6 and the lipschitz property of lemma 2 8 fix 0 and let x nk f be a convergent subsequence in c 0 f 1 k as guaranteed by corollary 2 5 and denote the limit as xf fix f 1 k for a given 0 let ef f a a 0 0 and denote ank t nk i i 0 nc 0 a n n ank then exf a ef where e denotes the closure of e furthermore l nk converges to mxf in c 0 and we have l x mxf x xf x 17 for all x ef for any t 0 e xf t xf t l t f t f t 18 where t max s t s e 14 clayton barnes proof by lemma 2 1 iii an ef hence a ef and a ef we assume there exists a such that

any a 0 1 k there is a decreasing sequence a n in converging to a and f a n in f a by right continuity this implies ef a so ef a and we have shown ef a similarly exf a to show 17 let x ef and choose a nk ik ank such that a nk ik x we know l nk a nk ik mx nk f a nk ik x nk f a nk ik taking limits as k on both sides and using the assumption that x nk f converges uniformly to xf we see l x mxf x xf x equation 18 follows from the convergence of x nk f to xf lemma 2 1 vii and the fact that there is a sequence of times t nk ik such that t nk ik t with t t nk ik t nk ik 1 the following result is classical and we state it as a lemma lemma 2 9 let g c 0 t be a nondecreasing function then g a inf t 0 g t a is the unique right continuous inverse function of g that is g 0 maxx g x r is the unique right continuous map such that g g id we now prove uniqueness of the subsequential limits of x n f l n theorem 2 10 for any 0 the sequence x n f l n converges uniformly on 0 f 1 k to a unique pair of continuous functions xf l where for s t 0 f 1 k s t xf t xf s xg t s for g x xf s l s f s x f s under g x l s x diffusions with local time dependent noise 15 proof step 1 again it suffices to show x n f converges to a unique function xf be cause in this case l n mx n f will converge to mxf let nk mk be two sequences such that x nk f xf and x mk f x f 20 uniformly in c 0 f 1 k we will show xf x f step 2 to do this we first show xf t x f t for all t ef where ef is given in lemma 2 8 assuming this fact note that f a ef for any a 0 1 k 17 shows xf xf a x f xf a then mxf xf a xf xf a x f xf a m x f xf a this means that xf is a right continuous inverse of m x f by lemma 2 9 xf x f in other words mxf and m x f are two continuous nondecreasing functions with domain 0 f 1 k having the same right continuous inverse hence mxf m x f on 0 f 1 k then given any t 0 f 1 k let t max s t s ef from 18 it follows that xf t xf t mxf t f t f t x f t m x f t f t f t x f t so that xf x f on the entire interval step 3 now we prove xf x f on ef denote xi as the partition of 0 f 1 k formed from t nk i t mk i from corollary 2 7 and lemma 2 8 we have x nk f t x mk f t i 0 k l nk xi l mk xi 2 nk mk f t

mf is nondecreasing i 0 mf t xi 1 mf t xi mf t 16 clayton barnes hence x nk f t x mk f t k x nk f x mk f ef 0 t 2 nk mk mf t 21 the right hand side of inequality 21 is nondecreasing so the same upper bound holds when taking the supremum of the term on the left hand over ef 0 t x nk f x mk f ef 0 t sup s ef 0 t x nk f t x mk f t k x nk f x mk f ef 0 t 2 nk mk mf t now take nk mk on both sides and apply 20 to see xf x f ef 0 t k xf x f ef 0 t mf t but in fact kmf t 1 for t 0 f 1 k by definition of f consequently unless xf x f ef 0 t 0 xf x f ef 0 t xf x f ef 0 t for all t ef which is a contradiction hence xf x f ef 0 t 0 i e xf x f on ef this next proposition shows the map f 7 x n f is asymptotically continuous with shifts of the initial condition and domain shifts of proposition 2 11 let n x n x where n zn 0 and zn z n let x z f be the unique function guaranteed by theorem 2 10 under the function and x nzn f be the unique function under n then x nzn f x z f 0 z f 1 k 0 proof proposition 2 4 can be modified to show that the collection x nzn f constructed with n is tight in c 0 f 1 k as in corollary 2 5 take a subsequence nk such that x nk znk f converges to a function x uniformly it suffices to show xf x since zn f is a shift of z f m zn f mz f zn z 0 so t n i zn f are hitting times for mf by lemma 2 1 iii one can show the results of lemma 2 8 hold with the times t nk i znk f and the set ef recall that f xi 1 f xi mf xi 1 mf xi 22 for xi xi 1 ef we incorporate the functions and n in the notation of the functions x n f given in 11 by letting x n zn f l n denote x

we have constructed xf l by showing x n f l n converges uniformly on 0 f 1 k to a unique function we extend this construction by showing that for each t x n f l n converges uniformly on 0 t to a unique pair xf l this extends theorem 2 10 to hold for c 0 t for any positive t theorem 2 12 for any t 0 x n f l n converges uniformly to a unique xf l c 0 t r 2 furthermore i for t 0 t let t sup 0 s

argument with the shifting property lemma 2 1 ix to show x n f converges uniformly on larger intervals set f 1 k and let xf be the limit of x n f on 0 by lemma 2 1 ix we write x n f t x n f x n g n t 23 18 clayton barnes for t 0 g 1 k for g n x x n f l n f x f n g n x l n x g x xf l f x f g x l x and 0 1 k applying proposition 2 11 with n l n zn x n f l n z xf l shows x n g n xg uniformly on 0 g 1 k consequently we can apply theorem 2 10 to x n f and x n g n with equation 23 because both terms on the right hand side converge uni formly the left hand side also converges uniformly thus x n f converges uniformly to a continuous function xf on 0 f 1 k g 1 k 0 f 2 k 2 furthermore x n f t xf xg t for t 0 g 1 k we can repeat this argument to see x n f converges uniformly on 0 f n k n for any n n since f is continuous it is bounded on compact time sets take n large enough so that for any t 0 then x n f converges uniformly on 0 f n k n 0 t 3 diffusions with local time dependent noise in this section we show that the map f 7 xf l constructed in section 2 when applied path wise to a brownian motion to yield the process xb l is a construction of the process y l in theorem 1 5 proposition 3 1 let r 0 r be a lipschitz function bounded away from zero p ft t 0 be a probability space supporting an ft adapted brownian motion b and take x 0 0 there exists a continuous ft adapted markov process x l such that the following holds almost surely for all t 0 t x t x 0 t 0 l s db s l 0 0 l is nondecreasing and flat off s x s l s 0 furthermore x t t 0 2 l s ds the proof of theorem 3 1 essentially follows from the results in section 2 proof almost every brownian path is continuous hence we can construct the pair x n b l n by replacing f in equation 11 pathwise with the brownian motion b from lemma 2 1 vii x n b is the stochastic integral with respect to brownian motion x n b x n b 0 t 0 nl n s n db s diffusions with local time dependent noise 19 where l n t mx n b t by theorem 2 12 x n b l n converges in c 0 t r 2 to the pair of processes xb l almost surely this along with lemma 2 1 x implies xb l is an ft adapted markov process note that l t mxb t is an ft adapted continuous nondecreasing process on 0 t hence p t 0 2 l s ds t 2 l t 1 and consequently we can define the stochastic integral t 0 l s db s 15 ch 3 2 clearly t 0 nl n s n l s 2 d b s t 0 nl n s n l s 2 ds t nl n

n b 0 t 0 in probability but we already know x n b xb almost surely therefore xb t xb 0 t 0 l s db s for all t 0 t almost surely where l mxb because xb can be constructed for any probability space supporting a brownian motion and is adapted to the same filtration this proves a strong solution exists theorem 3 2 y t x t l t x 0 l t t 0 l s db s is a process reflecting inside 0 with local time dependent noise that is l is the local time of y at zero furthermore there exists a continuous random field t a r 0 r r such that i t a is ft adapted for fixed a 20 clayton barnes ii the map t 7 t a is continuous and nondecreasing for each a with 0 a 0 and a flat off s y s a iii for every borel measurable k r r 0 t 0 k y s 2 l s ds 2 r k a t a da almost surely for all t 0 t we also have the ito tanaka formula for linear combinations of convex functions f f y t f y 0 t 0 f y s l s db s r t a d a 24 for all t 0 t almost surely furthermore l t is the local time of y at zero t 0 almost surely for all t 0 t here f is the left hand derivative which exists lebesgue almost everywhere and is the measure constructed from a b f b f a remark 2 see 15 chap 3 6 d where karatzas shreve refer to 24 as the generalized ito rule for convex functions the random field is the stochastic field of local times where t a is the local time of y at level set a and time t we use the same normalization of local time as karatzas shreve 15 remark 3 6 4 and ch 3 7 proof the statements i ii and iii follow from 15 ch 3 7 since x is a continuous martingale that l is the local time of y at zero apply 24 to f x x max x 0 so that f x 1 0 and 0 we have y t y 0 t 0 1 y s 0 l s db s t 0 25 for all t 0 t almost surely because the measure becomes a point mass at zero taking k x 1 0 in theorem 3 2 iii we see t 0 1 y s 0 d x s 0 for all t 0 t almost surely this implies that 1 y s 0 is equivalent to 1 y s 0 under the l 2 norm on 0 t generated by the measure m a e t 0 1 a t d x s consequently the stochastic integrals t 0 1 y s 0 l s db s and t 0 1 y s 0 l s db s t 0 l s db s x t x 0 diffusions with local time dependent noise 21 are indistinguishable that is they agree almost surely for all t 0 t 15 ch 3 2 since y 0 x 0 0 we write 25 as y t y 0 x t x 0 t 0 x t t 0 almost surely for all t 0 t now y t max y t 0 y t since y 0 so y t x t t 0 almost surely for all t 0 t but by definition y t x t l t hence l t and t 0 are indistinguishable consequently l is the martingale local time of y at zero justifying our claim that y is a reflected diffusion with local time dependent noise remark 3 by examining the proof of theorem 2 12 x n f converges to xf uniformly on 0 f c for any finite c 0 this holds even when f c since xf t xf t l t f t f t for all t t infs r mf s maxx r mf x this does not apply for brownian paths however since b c almost surely 3 1 time of determinacy in this subsection we give the proof of theorem 1 5 after introducing various lemmas we consider the pair y l when the noise of y is a function 0 with support 0 0 and locally lipschitz on 0 0 such a function is not bounded away from zero so existence of y l does not immediately follow from theorems 3 1 and 3 2 however x x for x 0 0 0 for x 0 does satisfy these properties for each 0 and we can build up a strong solution by letting decrease to zero it is conceivable that the noise will disappear completely if the noise decreases to zero at the random time the local time reaches 0 the edge of the support of after this time we may continuously extend the process to be zero that is it will be deterministically zero from this time forward because of this we call this time the time of determinacy and denote it by 0 formally 0 inf t 0 l t 0 inf t 0 l t 0 it is evident that 0 is a hitting time of l we characterize the distribution of hitting times of l in the statement of theorem 1 5 in order to stay true to our notation of f defined earlier the next proposition is phrased using this notation lemma 3 3 let an be a deterministic sequence of non negative real numbers con verging to a r 0 let b an inf t 0 b t an be the first time the running minimum of a standard brownian motion exceeds an then b an b a almost surely 22 clayton barnes proof let lim sup n b an lim inf n b an note and are stopping times and b maxn an almost surely for each there is a random sequence nk such that b ank by continuity b lim k b b ank lim k ank a by the strong markov property b t a t 0 is a standard brownian motion so for every 0 there is an s such that b s a 0 i e b s a almost surely this implies b a almost surely pick 0 and choose n such that an a for all n n then b an b a almost surely for all n n consequently lim sup n b an b a almost surely recall that z 7 b z is right continuous almost surely for a fixed 0 one can find such that b a b a with probability greater than 1 by letting 0 we see b a almost surely hence b a almost surely so b an b a almost surely as well lemma 3 4 let satisfy the conditions in theorem 3 1 choose 0 0 and c 0 such that 0 ds s c by remark 3 we can define the process y l on 0 b c then l x 0 b 0 ds s remark 4 this can be thought of as a time change formula for the local time proof according to lemma 2 1 iii l n t n n n n where t n n x 0 b n j 0 1 j n n note that n j 0 1 j n n 0 ds s since the sum is a riemann approximation converging to the integral by lemma 3 3 t n n x 0 b 0 ds s t diffusions with local time dependent noise 23 almost surely since l n converges to l uniformly on 0 x 0 b c 0 t almost surely and l t lim n l n t n n lim n n n almost surely proof of theorem 1 5 step 1 we show strong existence holds we assume 0 in the case 0 one replaces 0 below with n where n as 0 set s 0 ds s for 0 0 pick 0 we can construct a solution y t l t t 0 b s 0 where y t y 0 l t t 0 l s db t by lemma 3 4 l y 0 b s 0 0 so l s ranges from zero to 0 on 0 y 0 b s 0 this implies that l on 0 y 0 b s 0 so y t y 0 l t t 0 l s db t 26 for t 0 y 0 b s 0 this pathwise construction can be done for any 0 take the sequence n 1 n and for a given sample path of brownian motion define yn t x 0 l t xb t 27 where xb l is constructed according to theorem 2 12 for t 0 y 0 b s 0 1 n for n m the paths yn and ym are identical almost surely on their common domain 0 y 0 b 0 1 n by taking n a strong solution y l of 27 can be defined on 0 y 0 b s 0 where s 0 lim 0 s 0 0 0 ds s by setting y t limn yn t for t 0 y 0 b s 0 this shows a strong solution to 26 holds for t 0 when 0 0 ds s furthermore lemma 3 4 yields l y 0 b s 0 1 n 0 1 n so the noise of y at time y 0 b s 0 1 n is l y 0 b s 0 1 n 0 1 n consequently the noise of y t approaches zero as t approaches y 0 b 0 0 ds s setting y t 0 for t y solves 26 for all t 0 as long as we can sensibly define l for these times one option would be to freeze l t at 0 after time but then l would not retain the notion of local time because the local time 24 clayton barnes of a constant function at that level is infinite it seems more natural to define l t for t meaning l would jump to infinity with these definitions y l solves 26 by extending 0 step 2 we characterize the laplace transform for the hitting time of l for any a 0 0 the argument in the previous step shows l y 0 b s a a that is a inf t 0 l t a y 0 bs a almost surely this characterizes the hitting times of l the laplace transform of y 0 b is well known 15 since y 0 is independent of the brownian path using the strong markov property we have y 0 b a d w y 0 b a where w and b are two independent standard brownian motions independent of y 0 the laplace transform is then computed e exp a e exp w y 0 b s a e exp 2 y 0 e exp 2 a 0 ds s 4 propagation of chaos for systems of diffusions in this section we characterize the macroscopic behavior for systems of reflected diffusions interacting through the local time of the processes in the system in the prescribed manner for a given n let p ft t 0 be a probability space sup porting n independent ft adapted brownian motions bi for i 1 n for any lipschitz function 0 0 we consider continuous ft adapted processes x n i l n i such that 1 holds for all t 0 t almost surely we assume that x n i 0 are i i d and independent of the brownian motions in the convergence theorems we also assume there exist i i d xi 0 such thatw 1 x n i 0 xi 0 0 here w 1 is the wasserstein 1 metric recall that convergence in this metric is equivalent to the existence of a probability space supporting x n i 0 xi 0 such that x n i 0 converges almost surely and in l 1 to xi 0 theorem 4 1 strong existence and uniqueness let 0 0 be

surely this is sufficient for tightness recall definition 4 we denote 1 n n i 1 m x n i bi a as mn a for convenience the lemma below is an analog of lemma 3 4 and the proof is similar lemma 4 5 for each a 0 l n mn a 0 ds s a almost surely we use the following classical lemma whose proof remains for the reader lemma 4 6 let fn be a sequence in c 0 t converging uniformly to a function f if f is strictly increasing then for any a f 0 f t fn a f a proposition 4 7 l n converges in distribution to a deterministic continuous function such that emb xi 0 t a 0 ds s a 28 clayton barnes in particular when xi 0 0 em b t 2 t and therefore 2 a 0 d s 2 a proof by tightness of l n let l nk be some sequence of processes converging in distribution to a process l by the slln 1 n n i 1 mbi x n i 0 t emb 1

is continuous and nondecreasing hence almost every path has a unique nondecreasing and right continuous right inverse determined from its values on a dense set by 30 this right inverse is deterministic and not dependent on the subsequence nk therefore l is deterministic and does not depend on the subsequence nk when x 1 0 0 we know emb t 2 t so the right inverse is in fact equal to a 7 2 a 0 d s 2 we now prove theorem 1 3 proof of theorem 1 3 as in 29 x n i can be written as a time change of a reflected brownian motion zi x n i d zi n n t t 0 2 l n s ds by proposition 4 7 this time change n converges in distribution to a deterministic function 0 2 s ds consequently any finite collection of particles x n 1 xk diffusions with local time dependent noise 29 will converge to x 1 x k given by x i xi 0 zi 0 2 s ds 31 li t local time at zero of x i at time t where the zi are independent reflected brownian motions and xi 0 is the dis tributional limit of x n i 0 therefore x n 1 xk converges to a collection of independent processes this demonstrates propagation of chaos for the system to show the remaining claims we use a standard localization argument by first assuming to be bounded the convergence assumption onx n i imply the existence of a probability space so x n i 0 xi 0 almost surely and in l 1 by proposition 4 7 l n converges in probability to c 0 t consequently we have a subsequence nm such that l nm almost surely from boundedness of it follows that l nm 0 t 0 almost surely and in l 2 we have x n i x n i 0 t sup t 0 t l n i t x n i 0 t 0 l n s dbi s l i t xi 0

maximal inequality e x nm i x i 0 t e x nm i 0 xi 0 2 e t 0 l nm s s 2 ds e x nm i 0 xi 0 2 te l nm 2 0 t 0 32 this also shows that x n 1 x n k converges as a distribution on c 0 t r k to the k tuple of independent processes x 1 x k consequently by the triangle inequality and exchangeability of the system e l nm 1 nm nm i 1 l i 0 t e x nm i x i 0 t 0 but by the slln 1 n n i 1 l i t el 1 t 30 clayton barnes for each fixed t almost surely so l nm converges to el 1 in l 1 since l nm already converges in probability to we conclude l t el 1 t for all t 0 t almost surely 4 1 hydrodynamic limit measure on path space vs measure valued paths in this subsection we compare two different ways of viewning the empirical collection of particles x n 1 x n n that of a measure on path space scheme a and that of measure valued paths scheme b we first describe scheme a for each n 7 x n i maps the probability space to c 0 t consequently 7 x n i is a map from to p c 0 t the space of probability measures on c 0 t with the metric of weak convergence here g is the point mass at g c 0 t therefore n 1 n n i 1 x n i is a random element in p c 0 t in other words n is a random measure on path space in scheme b we view n as a measure valued path note that for a fixed time t 0 t x n i t i 1 n is a random collection of particles in r so n t 1 n n i 1 x n i t is a random element in p r the space of probability measures on r with the metric of weak convergence it follows easily from path wise continuity of the x n i that n t is a s continuous in t under this metric therefore n t is random element in c 0 t p r i e a continuous p r valued process and induces a measure on continuous measure valued paths theorem 4 8 hydrodynamic limit a let q denote the law on c 0 t induced by the process x 1 limn x n 1 then n converges weakly to q that is n q in p c 0 t theorem 4 9 hydrodynamic limit b let q t x be the density of x 1 the empir ical process n converges in distribution to q t x dx t 0 t in c 0 t p r where q is the transition density of the process x 1 theorem 4 8 is equivalent to the propagation of chaos theorem 1 3 for exchange able systems of processes see me leard 19 where the difference between settings a and b is discussed and an easily adapted argument shows that theorem 4 8 implies theorem 4 9 diffusions with local time dependent noise 31 5 existence and uniqueness of the pde the limit process of x 1 admits a density because it is a continuously differentiable time change of a reflected brownian motion as given in equation 31 let q t x be the density of x 1 with initial condition x 1 0 from the generalized ito rule with convex functions 15 chap 3 6 d we see from 31 that t 0 1 0 y s 2 s 2 ds 2 1 0 t a da where t a is the random field local time of x 1 t 0 l 1 t by taking expec tations of both sides letting 0 one can show using a dominated convergence argument that 2 el 1 t t 0 q s 0 d x 1 s t 0 q s 0 2 s ds so t el 1 t 1 2 t 0 q 0 s 2 s ds 33 then the pair q solves the pde given in subsection 1 2 where x 1 0 d f the condition lim t 0 q t dx f dx can be interpreted as x 1 t approaching x 1 0 almost surely as t 0 so in par ticular the distribution of x 1 at time t converges to that of x 1 0 as t 0 see remark 6 below remark 6 one can also demonstrate 33 from the time change representation of x 1 given in 31 reflected brownian motion z 1 can be expressed as z 1 lz 1 b where lz 1 is the local time of z 1 at zero and b is a brownian motion then 31 becomes x 1 t x 1 0 lz 1 t 0 2 s ds b t 0 2 s ds and furthermore l 1 t lz 1 t 0 2 s we use the classical fact that elz 1 u 1 2 u 0 p 0 s ds where p x t is the transition density of z 1 see 2 for a more general result define u t t 0 2 s ds 32 clayton barnes then el 1 t 1 2 e lz 1 u t 1 2 t 0 p 0 u s du s 1 2 t 0 p 0 u s 2 s ds 1 2 t 0 q 0 s 2 s ds here q x s is the transition density of x 1 if x 1 0 0 we know from classical theory 15 that elz 1 u 2 2 u there fore as in remark 6 2 t 1 2 elz 1 u t 2 2 u t 2 t 0 2 s ds the integral representation of implies exists so taking derivatives of both sides above t t 1 2 t 0 0 34 this fact which was derived using the explicit formula of the expectation for local time of reflected brownian motion shows that the solution for in equations 2 5 can be computed from q by solving 34 however the solution of q and are dependent since q depends on once it is found example 2 x 1 xp 2 for p 0 solving 34 when x 1 xp 2 t 1 t p 1 so t pt 1 p 2 where p p 2 1 p 2 the time change of the solution to the classical neumann problem or equivalently the time change of the reflected brownian motion is determined by u s s 0 2 x dx 1 p s 0 dx xp p 2 ps 2 p 2 p 2 where p p 2 2 p p p 1 the propagation of chaos result theorem 1 3 gives existence of a process x 1 whose transition density exists and satisfies 2 5 to show uniqueness we use a stochas tic representation coupling by considering two solutions and expressing each as an appropriate time change of the same reflected brownian motion diffusions with local time dependent noise 33 theorem 5 1 uniqueness there exists a unique pair q that solves 2 5 in the classical sense proof existence follows from letting q be the transition density of x 1 and t el 1 t as mentioned above to demonstrate uniqueness assume q 1 1 q 2 2 are two solutions of 2 5 let p ft t 0 be a probability space supporting a brownian motion b consider two processes z 1 z 2 driven by b so zi are coupled on p solving zi t x 1 0 lzi t t 0 i s db s 35 where lzi is the local time of zi at zero and x 1 0 d f dx is independent of b the density of zi qi t x solves 2 5 with i in place of the same argument as in remark 6 shows qi is the unique solution because it is the specific time change given by i as mentioned in remark 5 lzi is the signed running minimum of x 1 0 t 0 i s db s i t elzi t because z 1 z 2 are driven by the same brownian motion we obtain similar bounds as 32 by jensen s inequality and doob s maximal inequality 1 2 2 0 t e lz 1 lz 2 2 0 t e lz 1 lz 2 2 0 t e 0 1 s 2 s db s 2 0 t 4 e t 0 1 s 2 s 2 ds by lipschitz continuity of 1 2 2 0 t k t 0 1 s 2 s 2 ds k t 0 1 2 2 0 s ds gro nwall s inequality implies 1 2 2 0 t is bounded by 1 0 2 0 expkt which is zero therefore 1 2 from the definition 35 we see z 1 z 2 0 t 2 t 0 1 s 2 s db s 0 t 0 so z 1 t z 2 t for all t 0 t almost surely consequently q 1 q 2 because q 1 and q 2 are the transition density of the same process remark 7 at the end of the proof of theorem 5 1 we showed that p z 1 t z 2 t for all t 0 t 1 in other words we demonstrated strong uniqueness of processes solving 6 and 7 this was used to show uniqueness of the pair q solving 2 5 in fact strong existence and uniqueness of the aforementioned process is equivalent to existence and uniqueness
