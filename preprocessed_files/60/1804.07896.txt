random weighted averages partition structures and generalized arcsine laws jim pitman dept statistics evans hall u c berkeley ca 94720 april 24 2018 abstract this article offers a simplified approach to the distribution theory of randomly weighted averages orp meansmp x j xjpj for a sequence of i i d random variables x x 1 x 2 and independent random weights p pj with pj 0 and j pj 1 the collection of distributions of mp x indexed by dis tributions of x is shown to encode kingman s partition structure derived from p for instance if xp has bernoulli p distribution on 0 1 the nth moment of mp xp is a polynomial function of p which equals the probability generat ing function of the number kn of distinct values in a sample of size n from p e mp xp n epkn this elementary identity illustrates a general moment formula for p means in terms of the partition structure associated with random samples from p first developed by diaconis and kemperman 1996 and kerov 1998 in terms of random permutations as shown by tsilevich 1997 if the par tition probabilities factorize in a way characteristic of the generalized ewens sam pling formula with two parameters found by pitman 1995 then the mo ment formula yields the cauchy stieltjes transform of an mean the anal ysis of these random means includes the characterization of 0 means known as dirichlet means due to von neumann 1941 watson

xjpj 1 where p p 1 p 2 is a random discrete distribution meaning that the pj are random variables with pj 0 and j pj 1 almost surely where x 1 x 2 and p are independent and it is assumed that the series converges to a well defined limit almost surely this article is concerned with characterizations of the exact distri bution of x under various assumptions on the random discrete distribution p and the sequence x 1 x 2 interest is focused on the case when the xi are i i d copies of some basic random variable x then x is a well defined random variable called the p mean of x whatever the distribution of x with a finite mean and whatever the random discrete distribution p independent of the sequence of copies of x these characterizations of the distribution of p means are mostly known in some form but the literature of random p means is scattered and the conceptual foundations of the theory have not been as well laid as they might have been there has been recent interest in refined development of the distribution theory of p means in various set tings especially for the model of distributions of p indexed by two parameters 2 whose size biased presentation is known as gem after griffiths engen and mc closkey and whose associated partition probabilities were derived by pitman 1995 see e g regazzini et al 2002 regazzini et al 2003 lijoi and regazzini 2004 james et al 2008 a james 2010 a b lijoi and pru nster 2009 see also ruggiero and walker 2009 petrov 2009 canale et al 2017 lau 2013 for other recent applications of two parameter model and closely related random discrete distributions in which settings the theory of means may be of further interest so it may be timely to review the foundations of the theory of random p means with special atten tion to p governed by the model and references to the historical literature and contemporary developments the article is intended to be accessible even to readers unfamiliar with the theory of partition structures and to provide motivation for further study of that theory and its applications to p means the article is organized as follows section 2 offers an overview of the distribution theory of p means with pointers to the literature and following sections for details section 4 develops the foundations of a general distribution theory for p means es sentially from scratch section 5 develops this theory further for some of the standard models of random discrete distributions the aim is to explain as simply as possible some of the most remarkable known results involving p means and to clarify relations between these results and the theory of partition structures introduced by kingman 1975 then further developed in pitman 1995 and surveyed in pitman 2006 chap ters 2 3 4 the general treatment of p means in section 4 makes many connections to those sources and motivates the study of partition structures as a tool for the analysis of p means 2 overview 2 1 scope this article focuses attention on two particular instances of the general random average construction x j xjpj i the xj are assumed to be independent and identically distributed i i d copies of some basic random variable x with the xj independent of p then x is called the p mean of x typically denoted mp x or x p ii the case x x 1 p 1 x 2 p 1 with only two non zero weights p 1 and p 1 1 p 1 it is assumed that p 1 is independent of x 1 x 2 but x 1 and x 2 might be independent and not identically distributed or they might have some more general joint distribution of course more general random weighting schemes are possible and have been stud ied to some extent for instance durrett and liggett 1983 treat the distribution of randomly weighted sums iwixi for random non negative weights wi not subject to any constraint on their sum and xi a sequence of i i d random variables indepen dent of the weight sequence but the theory of the two basic kinds of random averages indicated above is already very rich this theory was developed in the first instance 3 for real valued random variables xj but the theory extends easily to vector valued random elements xi including random measures as discussed in the next subsection here for a given distribution of p the collection of distributions of mp x in dexed by distributions of x is regarded as an encoding of kingman s partition struc ture derived from p corollary 9 that is the collection of distributions of n the random partition of n indices generated by a random sample of size n from p for in stance if xp has bernoulli p distribution on 0 1 the nth moment of the p mean of xp is a polynomial in p of degree n which is also the probability generating function of the numberkn of distinct values in a sample of size n from p e mp xp n epkn proposition 10 this elementary identity illustrates a general moment formula for p means involving the exchangeable partition probability function eppf which de scribes the distributions of n corollary 22 an equivalent moment formula in terms of a random permutation whose cycles are the blocks of n was found by diaconis and kemperman 1996 for the 0 model and extended to general partition struc tures by kerov 1998 as shown in section 5 7 following tsilevich 1997 this mo ment formula leads quickly to characterizations of the distribution of p means when the eppf factorizes in a way characteristic of the two parameter family of gem models defined by a stick breaking scheme generating p from suitable independent beta factors then the moment formula yields the cauchy stieltjes transform of an mean x derived from an i i d sequence of copies of x the analysis of these random means x includes the includes the characterization of 0 means commonly known as dirichlet means due to von neumann 1941 watson 1956 and cifarelli and regazzini 1990 as well as generalizations of le vy s arcsine law for the time spent positive by a brownian motion due to lamperti 1958 and barlow pitman and yor 1989 2 2 random measures to illustrate the idea of extending p means from random variables to random mea sures suppose that the xj are random point masses xj yj 1 yj for a sequence of i i d copies yj of a random element y with values in an abstract measurable space s s with ranging over s then p mp 1 y j 1 yj pj 2 is a measure valued random p mean this is a discrete random probability measure on s s which places an atom of mass pj at location yj for each j informally p is a reincarnation of p pj as a random discrete distribution on s s instead of the positive integers obtained by randomly sprinkling the atoms pj over s according to the distribution of y in particular if the distribution of y is continuous on the event of probability one that there are no ties between any two y values the list of magnitudes of atoms of p in non increasing order is identical to the corresponding reordering p of the sequence p pj j 1 2 the original random discrete 4 distribution p on positive integers and the derived random discrete distribution p on s s are then so similar that using the same symbol p for both of them seems justified the integral of a suitable real valued s measurable function g with respect to p is just the p mean of the real valued random variable g y s g s p ds mp g y j g yj pj 3 hence the analysis of random probability measures p of the form 2 on an ab stract space s s reduces to an analysis of distributions of p means mp x for real valued x g y for p a listing of the normalized jumps of a standard gamma process r 0 r that is a subordinator or increasing process with stationary independent increments with p r dx dx 1 r xr 1 e x 1 x 0 4 formula 2 is ferguson s 1973 construction of a dirichlet random probability mea sure p on s s governed by the measure p y with total mass for r s 0 let r s denote a random variable with the beta r s distribution on 0 1 p r s du du r s r s ur 1 1 u s 11 0 u 1 5 such a beta r s variable is conveniently constructed from the standard gamma pro cess r r 0 by the beta gamma algebra r s r r s r r s 6 where s r s r d s is a copy of s that is independent of r and r s and r s are independent 7 as a consequence for g s 1 s b in 3 so g x has the bernoulli p distri bution on 0 1 for p p y b the simplest dirichlet mean 3 for an indicator variable has a beta distribution p b d p q for p p y b q 1 p 8 see section 5 3 for further disussion replacing the gamma process by a more general subordinator makes p a homo geneous normalized random measure with independent increments hrmi as studied by regazzini et al 2003 james et al 2009 from the perspective of bayesian in ference for p given a random sample of size n from p basic properties of p means derived from normalized subordinators are developed here in section 5 2 5 2 3 splitting off the first term it is a key observation that the p mean of an i i d sequence can sometimes be ex pressed as a p 1 p 1 mean by the splitting off the first term that is the decomposition x p j 1 xjpj 9 x 1 p 1 x rp 1 where x r j 1 xj 1 rj 10 with rj pj 1 p 1 the residual probability sequence defined on the eventp 1 0 by first conditioning p on 2 3 and then shifting back to 1 2 in general the residual sequence r may be dependent on p 1 then x r and p 1 will typically not be independent and analysis of x p will be difficult however if p 1 and r 1 r 2 are independent 11 then p 1 x 1 and x r are mutually independent so x p x 1 p 1 x rp 1 12 the right side is the p 1 p 1 mean of x 1 and x r with p 1 independent of x 1 and x r which are independent but typically not identically distributed this basic decomposition of a p mean by splitting off the first term leads naturally to discussion of p means for random discrete distributions defined by a recursive split ting of this kind called residual allocation models or stick breaking schemes discussed further in section 5 1 2 4 le vy s arcsine laws an inspirational example of splitting off the first term is provided by the work of le vy 1939 on the distributions of the time at spent positive up to time t and the time gt of the last zero before time t for a standard brownian motion b at t 0 1 bu 0 du and gt max 0 u t bu 0 see e g kallenberg 2002 theorem 13 16 for background to place this example in the framework of p means let p 1 1 g 1 be the length of the meander interval g 1 1 let x 1 1 b 1 0 be the indicator of the event b 1 0 with bernoulli 12 distribution let pj xj for j 2 be an exhaustive listing of the lengths pj of excursion intervals of b away from 0 on 0 g 1 with xj the indicator of the event that bt 0 for t in the excursion interval of length pj 6 if the lengths pj for j 2 are put in a suitable order for instance by ranking then xj j 1 will be a sequence of i i d copies of a bernoulli 12 variable x 1 2 with xj j 1 independent of the excursion lengths pj j 1 then by construction a 1 mp x 1 2 is the p mean of a bernoulli 1 2 indicator x 1 2 representing the sign of a generic excursion this is so for any listing p of excursion lengths of b on 0 1 that is independent of their signs but if p 1 1 g 1 puts the meander length first as above then the residual sequence r 1 r 2 is identified with the sequence of rel ative lengths of excursions away from zero of b on 0 g 1 but that is also the list of excursion lengths of the rescaled process bbr b ug 1 g 1 0 u 1 with corresponding positivity indicators x 2 x 3 le vy showed that bbr is a standard brownian bridge equivalent in distribution to bu 0 u 1 b 1 0 and that a last exit decomposition of the path of b at time g 1 makes the length p 1 of the me ander interval independent of bbr hence also independent of the residual sequence r 1 r 2 and the positivity indicators x 2 x 3 which are encoded in the path of bbr let abr 1 denote the total time spent positive by this brownian bridge b br so abr 1 d a 1 b 1 0 while also abr 1 j 1 rjxj 1 by the previous construction then the last exit decomposition provides a splitting of a 1 mp x of the general form 12 in this instance a 1 x 1 p 1 a br 1 p 1 13 where on the right side x 1 p 1 and abr 1 are independent with x 1 1 b 1 0 d x 1 2 a bernoulli 1 2 indicator p 1 the meander length abr 1 the total time spent positive by bbr and p 1 1 p 1 g 1 the last exit time le vy showed the meander interval has length p 1 d 1 2 1 2 known as the arcsine law because p 1 2 1 2 u 2 arcsin u 0 u 1 14 while the bridge occupation time has the uniform 0 1 distribution abr 1 d 1 1 le vy then deduced from 13 that the unconditioned occupation timea 1 has the same arcsine distribution as p 1 and g 1 p 1 a 1 d p 1 d g 1 d 1 2 1 2 15 7 2 5 generalized arcsine laws le vy s arcsine laws 15 for the brownian occupation time a 1 the time g 1 of the last zero in 0 1 and the meander length p 1 1 g 1 and his associated uniform law for the brownian bridge occupation times abr 1 have been generalized in several differ ent ways one of the most far reaching of these generalizations gives corresponding results when the basic brownian motion b is replaced by process with exchangeable increments discrete time versions of these results were first developed by andersen 1953 feller 1971 xii 8 theorem 2 gave a refined treatment with the follow ing formulation for a random walk sn x 1 xn with exchangeable incre ments xi started at s 0 0 the random number of times n i 1 1 si 0 that the walk is strictly positive up to time n has the same distribution as the random in dex min 0 k n sk mn at which the walk first attains its maximum value mn max 0 k n sk in the brownian scaling limit sparre andersen s identity im plies the equality in distribution a 1 d gmax 1 the last time in 0 1 that brownian motion attains its maximum on 0 1 that the distribution of gmax 1 is arcsine was shown also by le vy who then argued that gmax 1 d g 1 the time of the last zero of b on 0 1 by virtue of his famous identity in distribution of reflecting processes mt bt t 0 d bt t 0 16 where mt max 0 s tbs is the running maximum process derived from the path of b many other generalizations of the arcsine law have been developed typically start ing from one of the many ways this distribution arises from brownian motion or from one of its many characterizations by identities in distribution or moment evaluations see for instance kallenberg 2002 theorem 15 21 for the result that le vy s arcsine law 15 extends to the occupation time a 1 of 0 up to time 1 for any symmetric le vy process x with p xt 0 0 instead of b with g 1 replaced by gmax 1 the last time in 0 1 that x attains its maximum on 0 1 and p 1 replaced by 1 gmax 1 see also taka cs 1996 a b 1999 1998 petit 1992 and mansuy and yor 2008 chap ter 8 regarding the distribution of occupation times of brownian motion with drift and other processes derived from brownian motion see getoor and sharpe 1994 bertoin and yor 1996 bertoin and doney 1997 for more general results on le vy processes and knight 1996 and fitzsimmons and getoor 1995 for an extension of the uniform distribution of abr 1 for brownian motion to more general bridges with exchangeable increments and yano 2006 for an extension to conditioned diffusions watanabe 1995 gave generalized arc sine laws for occupation times of half lines of one dimensional diffusion processes and random walks which were further developed in kasahara and yano 2005 and watanabe et al 2005 yet another generalization of the arcsine law was proposed by lijoi and nipoti 2012 the focus here is on generalized arcsine laws involving the distributions of p means for some random discrete distribution p the framing of le vy s description of the laws of the brownian occupation times a 1 and abr 1 as p means of a bernoulli 1 2 variable for distributions of p determined by the lengths of excursions of a brownian motion or brownian bridge inspired the work of barlow pitman and yor 1989 and 8 pitman and yor 1992 these articles showed how le vy s analysis could be extended by consideration of the path of bt 0 t t for a random time t independent of b with the standard exponential distribution of 1 for then gt t d g 1 by brownian scaling while the last exit decomposition at timegt breaks the path ofb on 0 t into two independent random fragments of random lengths gt and t gt respectively thus g 1 d gt t gt gt t gt d 1 2 1 2 1 2 d 1 2 1 2 this realizes the instance r s 1 2 of the beta gamma algebra 6 in the path of brownian motion stopped at the independent gamma 1 distributed random time t a similar subordination construction was exploited earlier by greenwood and pitman 1980 in their study of fluctuation theory for le vy processes by splitting at the time gmaxt of the last maximum before an independent exponential time t see bertoin 1996 and kyprianou 2014 for more recent accounts of this theory this involves the lengths of excursions of the le vy process below its running maximum process m le vy recognized that for a brownian motion b his famous identity in law of processes m b d b as in 16 implied that the structure of excursions of b below m is identical to the structure of excursions of b away from 0 this leads from the decomposition of m b at the time gmaxt of the last zero of m b on 0 t to the corresponding decomposition for b discussed earlier the same method of subordination was exploited further in pitman and yor 1997 a proposition 21 in a deeper study of random discrete distributions derived from stable subordinators the above analysis of the p mean mp x for an indicator variable x x 1 2 and p the list of lengths of excursions of a brownian motion or brownian bridge was generalized by barlow pitman and yor 1989 to allow any discrete distribution of x with a finite number of values that corresponds to a linear combination of occupation times of various sectors in the plane by walsh s brownian motion on a finite number of rays whose radial part is b and whose angular part is made by assigning each excursion of b to the ith ray with some probability pi independently for different excursions the analysis up to an independent exponential time t relies only on the scaling properties of b the poisson character of excursions of b and beta gamma algebra all of which extend straightforwardly to the case when b is replaced by a bessel process or bessel bridge of dimension 2 2 for 0 1 then p becomes a list of excursion lengths of the bessel process or bridge over 0 1 while gt and t gt become independent gamma and gamma 1 variables with sum t that is gamma 1 so the distribution of the final meander length in the stable case is given by p 1 d t gt t d 1 17 by another application of the beta gamma algebra 6 the excursion lengths p in this case are a list of lengths of intervals of the relative complement in 0 1 of the range of a stable subordinator of index with conditioning of this range to contain 1 in the bridge case in particular for 0 p 1 the p mean of a bernoulli p indicator xp represents the occupation time of the positive half line for a skew brownian motion 9 or bessel process each excursion of which is positive with probability p and negative with probability 1 p the distribution of such a p mean say m 0 xp associated with a stable subordinator of index 0 1 and a selection probability parameter p 0 1 was found independently by darling 1949 and lamperti 1958 darling indicated the representation m 0 xp d t p t 1 where t s s 0 is the stable subordinator with e exp t s exp s 0 18 darling also presented a formula for the cumulative distribution function ofm 0 xp corresponding to the probability density p m 0 xp du du pq sin u 1 u 1 q 2 u 2 2 pqu u cos p 2 u 2 0 u 1 19 where q 1 p and u 1 u later zolotarev 1957 derived the corre sponding formula for the density of the ratio of two independent stable variables t p t 1 t p by mellin transform inversion this makes a surprising con nection between the stable subordinator and the cauchy distribution discussed fur ther in section 3 lamperti 1958 showed that the density of m 0 xp displayed in 19 is the density of the limiting distribution of occupation times of a recurrent markov chain under assumptions implying that the return time of some state is in the domain of attraction of the stable law of index and between visits to this state the chain en ters some given subset of its state space with probability p lamperti s approach was to first derive the the stieltjes transform e 1 m 0 xp 1 n 0 e m 0 xp n n q p 1 1 q p 1 20 where q 1 p the associated beta 1 distribution of p 1 appearing in 17 is also known as a generalized arcsine law in lamperti s setting of a chain returning to a recurrent state the results of dynkin 1961 presented also in feller 1971 xiv 3 imply that lamperti s limit law for occupation times holds jointly with convergence in distribution of the fraction of time since last visit to the recurrent state to the meander length p 1 as in 17 along with the generalization to this case of the distributional identity 13 which was exploited by barlow pitman and yor 1989 due to the results of sparre andersen mentioned earlier this beta 1 distribution also arises from random walks and le vy processes as both a limit distribution of scaled occupation times and as the exact distribution of the occupation time of the positive half line for a limiting stable le vy process xt with p xt 0 1 for all t but in the context of the 0 model for p this beta 1 distribution appears either as the distribution of the length of the meander interval p 1 as in 17 or as the distribution of a size biased pick p 1 from p see also pitman and yor 1992 and pitman and yor 1997 b 4 for closely related results and james 2010 b for an authoritative recent account of further developments of lamperti s work 10 2 6 fisher s model for species sampling a parallel but independent development of closely related ideas from the 1940 s to the 1990 s was initiated by fisher 1943 see pitman 1996 b for a review fisher introduced a theoretical model for species sampling which amounts to random sam pling from the random discrete distribution p 1 pm with the symmetric dirichlet distribution with m parameters equal to m on the m simplex of p 1 pm with p i 0 and m i 1 pi 1 see section 5 3 for a quick review of basic proper ties of dirichlet distributions fisher showed that many features of sampling from this symmetric dirichlet model for p have simple limit distributions as m with fixed ignoring the order of the pi the limit model may be constructed directly by supposing that the pi are the normalized jumps of a standard gamma process on the in terval 0 that model for a random discrete distribution called here the 0 model was considered by mccloskey 1965 as an instance of the more general model dis cussed in section 5 2 in which the pi are the normalized jumps of a subordinator on a fixed time interval 0 which for a stable subordinator corresponds to the 0 model involved in the le vy lamperti description of occupation times mccloskey showed that if the atoms of p in the 0 model are presented in the size biased order p of their appearance in a process of random sampling then p admits a sim ple stick breaking representation by a recursive splitting like 9 with i i d factors p j 1 p 1 p j 1 d 1 engen 1975 interpreted this gem 0 model as the limit in distribution of size biased frequencies in fisher s limit model this pre sentation of 0 model was developed in various ways by patil and taillie 1977 sethuraman 1994 and pitman 1996 a in this model for p p in size biased ran dom order the basic splitting 12 holds with a residual sequence r that is identical in law to the original sequence p hence also x r d x p then 12 becomes a character ization of the law of x p by a stochastic equation which typically has a unique solution as discussed in feigin and tweedie 1989 diaconis and freedman 1999 hjort and ongaro 2005 see also bacallado et al 2017 for a recent review of species sampling models ferguson 1973 and kingman 1975 further developed mccloskey s model of p derived from the normalized jumps of subordinator working instead with the ranked rearrangement p of p with p 1 p 2 0 however it is easily seen that the distribution of the p mean of a sequence of i i d copies of x is unaffected by any reordering of terms of p provided the reordering is made independently of the copies of x so for any random discrete distribution p and any distribution of x there is the equality in distribution mp x d m p x d mp x 21 where p can be any random rearrangement of terms of p this invariance in distribu tion of p means under re ordering of the atoms of p is fundamental to understanding the general theory of p means in the analysis ofmp x by splitting off the first term the distribution of mp x is the same no matter how the terms of p may be ordered but the ease of analysis depends on the joint distribution of p 1 and p 2 p 3 which in turn depends critically on the ordering of terms of p detailed study of problems 11 of this kind by pitman 1996 a explained why the size biased random permutation of terms p first introduced by mccloskey in the setting of species sampling is typically more tractable than the ranked ordering used by ferguson and kingman the nota tion p will be used consistently below to indicate a size biased ordering of terms in a random discrete distribution 2 7 the two parameter family the articles of perman et al 1992 and pitman and yor 1997 a introduced a family of random discrete distributions indexed by two parameters which includes the various examples recalled above in a unified way various terminology is used for dif ferent encodings of this family of random discrete distributions and associated random partitions the distribution of the size biased random permutationp is known as gem after griffiths engen and mccloskey who were among the first to study the sim ple stick breaking description of this model recalled later in 150 the distribution of the corresponding ranked arrangement p is known as the two parameter poisson dirichlet distribution pitman and yor 1997 a feng 2010 the corresponding random discrete probability measure on an abstract space s s constructed as in 2 by assigning the gem or poisson dirichlet atoms i i d locations in s has become known as a pitman yor process ishwaran and james 2001 the corresponding partition structure is governed by the sampling formula of pitman 1995 which is a two parameter generalization of the ewens sampling formula recently reviewed by crane 2016 the p means associated with the 0 model are commonly called dirichlet means james et al 2008 b james 2010 a the model refers here to this model of a random discrete distribution p whose size biased presentation is gem for such a p the associated p mean will be called simply an mean with similar terminology for other attributes of the model such as its partition structure following further work by numerous authors including cifarelli and regazzini 1990 diaconis and kemperman 1996 and kerov 1998 a definitive formula char acterizing the distribution of an mean x for an arbitary distribution of a bounded or non negative random variable x was found by tsilevich 1997 for all for which the model is well defined except if 0 or 0 the distribution of x is uniquely determined by the generalized cauchy stieltjes transform e 1 x e 1 x 6 0 6 0 0 22 companion formulas for the 0 case with 0 0 1 trace back to lamperti forx xp a bernoulli p variable as in 20 while the 0 case with 0 0 12 is the case of dirichlet means due to von neumann 1941 and watson 1956 in the classical setting of mathematical statistics involving ratios of quadratic forms of normal variables and developed by cifarelli and regazzini 1990 and others in fergu son s bayesian non parametric setting these formulas are all obtained as limit cases of the generic two parameter formula 22 naturally involving exponentials and log arithms due to the basic approximations of these functions by large or small powers as the case may be e g ex limn 1 x n n and log x lim 0 x 1 for x 0 for 0 1 the transform 22 was obtained earlier by barlow et al 1989 in their description of the distribution of occupation times derived from a brownian or bessel bridge by a straightforward argument from the perspective of markovian excursion theory but tsilevich s extension of this formula to general is not obvious from that perspective rather the simplest approach to tsilevich s for mula involves analysis of partition structure associated with model as discussed in section 5 7 further development of the theory of means was made by vershik yor and tsilevich 2001 see also the articles by james lijoi and coauthors listed in the introduction for the most refined analysis of means by inversion of the cauchy stieltjes transform 3 transforms typical arguments for identifying the distribution of a p mean involve encoding the distribution by some kind of transform this section reviews some probabilistic tech niques for handling such transforms by study of some key examples related to ratios of independent stable variables see chaumont and yor 2003 for further exercises with these techniques and james 2010 b for many deeper

distribution of logc given the event c 0 with p c 0 s d logc c 0 0 1 24 with s 1 0 and the distribution of s 0 defined as the limit distribution of s as 0 for each fixed with 0 1 the distribution of s is characterized by each of the following three descriptions to be evaluated for 0 by continuity in as detailed later in 34 13 i by the symmetric probability density p s ds ds f s sin 2 cos cosh s s r 25 ii by the characteristic function e exp i s sinh sinh r 26 iii by the moment generating function e exp rs e cr c 0 ir sin r sin r r 1 27 proof the linear change of variable 23 from the standard cauchy density ofc makes p c dx sin x 1 dx x 2 cos x 1 x r 28 restrict to x 0 and divide by p c 0 to obtain p c dx c 0 for x 0 make change of variable s log x ds x 1 dx x es in 28 to obtain the density p logc ds c 0 f s as in 25 with constant 2 p c 0 in place of 2 to check p c 0 use the standard formula p c c 1 2 arctan c arccot c 29 and the fact that 0 sin 1 for 0 1 to calculate p c 0 p c

continuation and the change of vari able x es as above to the classical mellin transform of a truncated cauchy density 0 xr dx 1 2 x cos x 2 sin sin r sin r r 1 32 whittaker and watson 1927 example 4 p 119 attribute this mellin transform to euler and present it to illustrate a general techique of computing mellin transforms by calculus of residues this mellin transform also appears as an exercise in complex variables in morse and feshbach 1953 part i problem 4 10 talacko 1956 gave details of the derivation of the fourier transform 31 by contour integration a more elementary proof of the key fourier transform 31 is indicated below 14 the fourier transform 31 appears also in zolotarev 1957 formula 21 at tributed to ryzhik and gradshtein 1951 p 282 but with a typographical error the lower limit of integration should be not 0 chaumont and yor 2012 4 23 present some of zolotarev s results below their 4 23 4 including 31 with the cor rect range of integration but missing a factor of 2 the 1 on their left side should be 1 2 as in 31 talacko 1956 regarded the family of symmetric densities f s for 0 s 1 as a one parameter extension of the case 1 2 with f 1 2 s 1 cosh s 1 2 1 cosh 2 33 and the limit case 0 with f 0 s 1 2 1 cosh s 1 4 cosh 2 s 2 0 sinh 34 these probability densities and their associated characteristic functions were found earlier by le vy 1951 in his study of the random area ale vy t 1 2 t 0 xsdys ysdxs 35 swept out by the path of two dimensional a brownian motion xt yt t 0 started at x 0 y 0 0 in terms of the distribution of s defined by the above proposition le vy proved that ale vy t d t s 1 2 and ale vy t xt yt 0 d t 2 s 0 36 le vy first derived the characteristic functions 0 and 1 2 by analysis of his area func tional of planar brownian motion he showed that the distributions of s 0 and s 1 2 are infinitely divisible each associated with a symmetric pure jump le vy process whose le vy measure he computed he then inverted 0 and 1 2 to obtain the densities f 0 and f 1 2 displayed above by appealing to the classical infinite products for the hyper bolic functions le vy s work on brownian areas inspired a number of further studies which have clarified relations between various probability distributions derived from brownian paths whose laplace or fourier transforms involve the hyperbolic functions see biane and yor 1987 and pitman and yor 2003 for comprehensive accounts of these distributions their associated le vy processes and several other appearances of the same fourier transforms in the distribution theory of brownian functionals and revuz and yor 1999 0 6 for a summary of formulas associated with the laws of s 0 and s 1 2 note from 26 and 34 that the characteristic function of s is derived from 0 by the identity 0 0 0 1 15 corresponding to the identity in distribution s 0 d s 0 s 0 1 where s 0 and s are assumed to be independent that is to say the distribution of s 0 is self decomposable as discussed further in jurek and yor 2004 an easier approach to these fourier relations 33 and 34 for 1 2 and 0 which extends to the fourier transform 31 for all 0 1 is to recognize the distributions involved as hitting distributions of a brownian motion in the complex plane the cauchy density of c in 28 is well known to be the hitting density of xt on the real axis for a complex brownian motion xt iyt t 0 started at the point on the unit semicircle in the upper half plane x 0 iy 0 cos 1 i sin 1 cos i sin and stopped at the random time t inf t yt 0 let xt iyt rt exp iwt be the usual representation of this complex brownian motion in polar coordinates with radial part rt and continuous angular winding wt starting from r 0 1 and w 0 1 then by construction c d xt rt 1 wt 0 rt 1 wt according to le vy s theorem on conformal invariance of brownian motion the process logrt iwt 0 t t is a time changed complex brownian motion u i u u 0 logrt iwt ut i ut where ut t 0 ds r 2 s and ut inf u u 0 see pitman and yor 1986 for further details of this well known construction the conclusion of the above argument is summarized by the following lemma which combined with the next proposition provides a nice explanation of the basic fourier transform 31 lemma 2 the talacko zolatarev distribution of s introduced in proposition 1 as the conditional distribution of logc given c 0 may also be represented as p s p 1 t t 0 p t t 37 where p governs t t 0 and t t 0 two independent brownian motions started at 0 0 and 0 0 and t inf t t 0 or proposition 3 with the notation of the previous lemma and the talacko zolatarev densities and characteristic functions f and defined as in proposition 1 the joint distribution of t and t is determined by any one of the following three formulas each of which holds jointly with a companion formula for 0 instead of with replaced by on the right side only so sin sin is unchanged and cos is replaced by cos cos 16 i the density of t on the event t with p t is p t ds t ds sin 2 cosh s cos f s 38 ii the corresponding cumulative distribution function is p t s t 1 2 1 2 arctan tan 2 tanh x 2 39 iii the corresponding fourier transform is e ei t 1 t sinh sinh 40 proof by the well known description of hitting probabilities for brownian motion in terms of harmonic functions the p distribution of t t is the harmonic measure on the boundary of the vertical strip s 0 s r for brownian motion with initial point 0 in the interior of the strip formula 38 is then read from the classical formula for the poisson kernel in the strip which gives the hitting density on the two vertical lines this formula is mentioned in hardy 1926 and derived in detail by widder 1961 as indicated by widder the formula for the poisson kernel for the strip follows easily from the corresponding kernel for the upper half plane by the method of conformally mapping is to ei is e sei this proves i and ii follows by integration as for iii it is easily seen that conditionally given t and t the distribution of t is gaussian with mean 0 and variance t hence e ei t 1 t e e 1 2 2 t 1 t sinh sinh 41 where the last equality is a well known formula for one dimensional brownian motion revuz and yor 1999 exercise ii 3 10 which holds because exp t 12 2 t t 0 is a martingale for each choice of sign and 0 the average of these two martingales is m t sinh t exp 12 2 t so p governs m t t 0 as a martingale with continuous paths which starts at m 0 sinh and is bounded by 0 m t sinh for 0 t t but sinh 0 0 makes sinh t sinh 1 t so sinh em 0 em t e sinh e 1 2 2 t 1 t as a check on 40 its limit as 0 gives p t 3 2 laplace and mellin transforms the laplace transform of a non negative random variable x x ee x 0 e xp x dx 42 17 can always be interpreted probabilistically as follows for 0 let d 1 be a standard exponential variable independent of x by conditioning on x x p x p x 0 43 this basic formula presents x as the survival probability function of the random ratio x whose distribution is the scale mixture of exponential distributions with a random inverse scale parameter x see steutel and van harn 2004 for much more about such scale mixtures of exponentials this formula 43 works with the convention x if x 0 for instance if x t has the standard stable law with laplace transform 18 then 43 gives p t exp 44 and hence for x 1 p t x p t x 1 exp x 45 that is to say in view of the uniqueness theorem for laplace transforms the standard stable distribution of t is uniquely characterized by the identity in law t d 46 where d 1 is an exponential variable with mean 1 independent of t equate real moments in 46 to see that the distribution of t has mellin transform et r 1 r 1 r r 1 47 this provides another characterization of the standard stable law of t by unique ness of mellin transforms this derivation of 46 and 47 is due to shanbhag and sreehari 1977 a more general mellin transform for stable laws appears much earlier in zolotarev 1957 theorem 3 consider now the ratio r t t of two independent standard stable vari ables immediately from 47 the mellin transform of r is er p 1 p 1 p 1 p 1 p 1 p p 1 p 1 p 1 sin p sin p p 1 48 by two applications of the reflection formula for the gamma function 1 z z sin z compare with 26 to see the identity in distribution r d s for s as in in proposition 1 that is p r dx sin dx 1 2 x cos x 2 x 0 49 equivalently by the change of variable r x 1 so x r dx r 1 dr p r dr sin r 1 dr 1 2 r cos r 2 r 0 50 18 by calculus the density 50 of r has derivative at r 0 which is is a strictly negative function of r multiplied by 1 x 2 2 x cos 1 where x r 51 analysis of this quadratic function of x explains the qualitative features of the densities of r displayed in figure 1 for selected values of 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4 figure 1 probability densities of r and r t t for k 8 1 k 7 the 7 densities of r in the left panel are those of the scaled cauchy variable c in 23 conditioned to be positive the curves are identified by their values at 0 which decrease as increases and their values at 1 which increase with the corresponding densities of r can be identified similarly in the right panel by unimodality of the cauchy density in the left panel each density of r is unimodal with maximum density at 0 for 1 2 and at sin 1 2 for 1 2 each density of r in the right panel has an infinite maximum achieved at 0 the discrimant of the quadratic 51 is 2 cos 2 2 1 which is negative for c where c 0 736484 is the unique root 0 1 of the equation 0 so the density of r is strictly decreasing for c with strictly negative derivative for c and with a unique point of inflection for c at 1 2 c 1 c 1 c 0 278018 for c as for the top two curves with 6 8 and 7 8 the density of r is bimodal with a local minimum at r and a local maximum at r where r x 1 for x the two roots in 0 1 of the quadratic 51 a common feature of the laws of r and r for all 0 1 is that each law has median 1 due to r d r 1 and each law has infinite mean as 1 both laws converge to the distribution degenerate at 1 but as 0 the behavior is different at each x 0 the density of r converges to 1 x 2 which is the density of the limit in distribution of r in parallel with this convergence as 0 the density of r converges pointwise to 0 as the distribution of r converges vaguely to an atom of 12 at 0 and an atom of 1 2 at this pointwise convergence of densities as 0 is apparent in both panels 3 3 cauchy stieltjes transforms for a real valued random variablex the cauchy stieltjes transform ofx is commonly defined to be the function of a complex variable z gx z e z x 1 z r 52 there are inversion formulas both for this transform as well as for the generalized cauchy stieltjes transform of x of order say gx z obtained by replacing the power 1 in 52 by gx z e z x z r 53 19 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 1 0 0 5 0 5 1 0 0 80 0 85 0 90 0 95 1 00 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 figure 2 discrimant and locations of the minimum and maximum of the density of r t t half the discriminant of the quadratic equation 51 is cos 2 2 1 as plotted in the left panel with c 0 736484 the unique root of this function in 0 1 the right panel shows the two graphs of r x 1 for x the two roots in 0 1 of the quadratic equation 51 for c 1 the lower curve r gives the location of the unique minimum in 0 1 of the density of r this location decreases from r c 0 278018 to 0 as increases from c to 1 the upper curve r is the location of the unique local maximum of the density 0 this modal value is always less than 1 and increases from r c 0 278018 to the median value of 1 as increases from c to 1 see demni 2016 for a recent article about this transform with references to earlier work for x with values in 0 1 it is more pleasant to deal with the variant of this transform e 1 x n 0 n n exn n gx 1 54 where the series is convergent and equal to e 1 x for every 1 by domi nated convergence a distribution of x on 0 1 is uniquely determined by its moment sequence exn n 0 1 2 hence also by its generalized cauchy stieltjes trans form of order for any fixed 0 for unbounded non negative x including x with ex for which there is not even a partial series expansion 54 for in any neighbourhood of 0 it is typically easier to work with e 1 x gx 0 55 here the left side is evidently a well defined and analytic function of with positive real part the right side may be understood by analytic continuation of gx z from non real values of z but arguments by analytic continuation can often be avoided by the following key observation by introducing with gamma distribution independent of x and conditioning on x the expectation in 55 is e 1 x e exp x 0 56 that is the ordinary laplace transform of x this determines the distribution of x by uniqueness of laplace transforms and the the following lemma which has been frequently exploited pitman and yor 2001 p 358 chaumont and yor 2012 1 13 20 4 2 4 24 mckinlay 2014 theorem 3 as a general rule in reading formulas in volving generalized stieltjes transforms of probability distributions of x especially x 0 matters are often simplified by interpreting the generalized stieltjes transform as the laplace transform of x lemma 4 cancellation of independent gamma variables for random variables or random vectors x and y and with gamma distribution independendent of both x and y for each real a there is the equivalence of identities in distribution ax d ay x d y 57 proof consider first the case of real random variables obviously p ax b p x b if b is any of the subsets 0 0 or 0 of r so by conditioning it may as well be assumed that both x and y are strictly positive when there is no dif ficulty in taking logarithms it is known gordon 1994 that the distribution of log is infinitely divisible hence has a characteristic function which does not vanish the conclusion in the univariate case follows easily by characteristic functions an appeal to the crame r wold theorem takes care of the multivariate case to illustrate these ideas let us derive the ordinary cauchy stieltjes transform of the ratio r t t of two i i d standard stable variables whose mellin transform and probability density were already indicated above from above the problem is to calculate e 1 r 1 e exp t t 58 for independent random variables d 1 and t d t but we already know from 46 that t d 1 so e 1 r 1 e exp 1 t e exp 1 1 59 thus the distribution of r is uniquely characterized by the simple cauchy stieltjes transform e 1 r 1 1 1 0 60 it is notable that the explicit formula 50 for the density of r with laplace stieltjes transform 1 1 is much simpler than the corresponding inversion for the common distribution of r d r 1 d 1 t which has 1 1 as its ordinary laplace transform p r x e x x 0 61 where e z k 0 zk k 1 z c is the classical mittag leffler function with parameter this is an entire function of z c for each c with strictly positive real part with 0 1 here this formula was found by pillai 1990 see also mainardi et al 2001 3 9 and 4 37 21 for closely related transforms and gorenflo et al 2014 for a recent survey of mittag leffler functions and their applications compare also with the density of t given by pollard 1946 p t dt dt 1 k 0 sin k 1 k 1 k 1 k tk 1 62 only for 1 2 when t 1 2 d 1 2 1 2 is there substantial simplification of this series formula but see penson and go rska 2010 for explicit expressions for the density 62 in terms of the meijer g function for rational and schneider 1986 for a general representation of stable densities in terms of fox functions see also ho et al 2007 returning to the context of random discrete distributions if p 0 is governed by the 0 model defined by normalizing the jumps of a stable subordinator on some fixed interval of length say s 0 then it is evident that for x xp the indicator of an event of probability p the distribution of the p 0 mean of xp is determined by m 0 xp d t p t 1 d p 1 t p 1 t q 1 t d 1 1 cr 63 where t s s 0 is the stable subordinator with t s d s 1 t for t the standard stable variable as above and c q p 1 for q 1 p here the second d appeals to the decomposition of t 1 into two independent components t 1 t p t 1 t p with t p d p 1 t and t 1 t p d q 1 t the distribution of m 0 xp is thus obtained from that of r by a simple change of variable moreover for any real x the identity 1 1 cx 1 1 1 1 cx 1 1 allows the cauchy stieltjes transform of 1 cx 1 to be expressed directly in terms of that of x in particular for the ratio of independent stable variables x r with the simple cauchy stieltjes transform 60 and c q p 1 with q 1 p this algebra simplifies nicely to give in 63 e 1 m 0 xp 1 q p 1 1 q p 1 64 this is the stieltjes transform 20 found by lamperti see pitman and yor 1997 b 4 for further discussion 4 some basic theory of p means this section presents some general theory of p means for an arbitrary random discrete distribution p and its relation to kingman s theory of partition structures relying only the simplest examples to motivate the development this postpones to section 5 7 the study of the rich collection of examples associated with the model 22 4 1 partition structures kingman 1978 introduced the concept of the partition structure associated with sam pling from a random probability distribution f that is the collection of probability distributions of the random partitions n of the set n 1 n generated by a random sample y 1 yn from f meaning that conditionally given f the yi are i i d according f the blocks of n are the equivalence classes of the restriction to n of the random equivalence relation i j iff yi yj a convenient encoding of this par tition structure is provided by its exchangeable partition probability function eppf pitman 1995 this is a function p of compositions n 1 nk of n that is to say sequences of k positive integers n 1 nk with k i 1 ni n for some 1 k n the function p n 1 nk gives for each particular partition b 1 bk of n into k blocks the probability p n b 1 bk p b 1 bk 65 where bi is the size of the block bi of indices j with the same value of yj a ran dom partition n of n is called exchangeable iff its distribution is invariant under the natural action of permutations of n on partitions of n equivalently its probability function is of the form 65 for some function p n 1 nk that is non negative and symmetric the sum of these probabilities 65 over all partitions b 1 bk of n into various numbers k of blocks must then equal 1 this constraint is most easily expressed in terms of the associated exchangeable random composition of n n ex n n ex 1 n n ex 2 n n ex kn n defined by listing the sizes of blocks of n in an exchangeable random order this means that conditionally given the numberkn of components of n equals k for some 1 k n and that n b 1 bk for some particular sequence of blocks b 1 bk which may be listed in any order for instance their order of least el ements n ex n b 1 b k where is a uniform random permutation of k as indicated in pitman 2006 2 8 the usual probability function of this random composition of n is the exchangeable composition probability function ecpf p n ex n n 1 nk p ex n 1 nk 1 k n n 1 nk p n 1 nk 66 these probabilities must sum to 1 over all compositions of n so the normalization condition on an eppf is that for pex derived from p using the multiplier in 66 n k 1 n 1 nk pex n 1 nk 1 67 here and in similar sums below n 1 nk ranges over the set of n 1 k 1 composi tions of n into k parts to understand 66 observe that putting the components of n in an exchangeable random order creates a random ordered partition of n with block sizes n ex n so p n ex n n 1 nk is the sum over all ordered partition of n 23 into k blocks of the specified sizes of the probability of each ordered partition of those sizes each particular ordered partition has probability p n 1 nk k and the num ber of these ordered partitions with sizes n 1 nk is the multinomial coefficient for n generated by sampling from a random discrete distribution with atoms of sizes pj let j 1 jn denote the corresponding sample of positive integer indices then for each particular partition b 1 bk of n as in 65 p n b 1 bk k i 1 bi j ji e k i 1 pniji with ni bi hence by conditioning on p p n 1 nk j 1 jk e k i 1 pniji 68 where the sum is over all sequences of k distinct positive integers j 1 jk as observed by kingman as n varies the partition structure associated with sampling from a random distribution is subject to a consistency condition the restriction of n 1 to n must be n for every n 1 in terms of the eppf this consistency condition implies p n k 1 i 1 p n i 69 where n n 1 nk ranges over compositions of n and n i for 1 i k 1 is n with the ith component incremented by 1 meaning for n 1 obtained by appending a 1 to n for i k 1 see pitman 2006 3 2 for further discussion the instance of the general formula 3 when s s is the unit interval 0 1 with borel sets and the yj uj are i i d uniform 0 1 variables independent of p is of particular importance write fp for the random probability measure on 0 1 which sprinkes the atoms of p at i i d uniform random locations so by definition for all bounded or non negative measurable g 1 0 g u fp du mp g u j 1 g uj pj 70 in particular for g u 1 u v the indicator of the interval 0 v the random cumulative distribution function c d f of fp is fp 0 v mp 1 u v j 1 1 uj v pj 0 v 1 71 note that fp 0 0 0 and fp 0 1 1 almost surely the following proposition summarizes some well known facts proposition 5 kallenberg 1973 kingman 1978 the random c d f f v fp 0 v derived as above for 0 v 1 from a random discrete distribution p 24 is a process with exchangeable increments meaning that for each m 1 2 the sequence f i m f i 1 m 1 i m is exchangeable the collection of distributions of these exchangeable sequences is an encoding of the partition structure generated by p as is the collection of finite dimensional distributions of p the ranked re ordering of p and the collection of finite dimensional distributions of p the size biased permutation of p in other words for two random discrete distributions p and q with associated random c d f s with exchangeable increments fp and fq and exchangeable partition probability functions pp and pq the following conditions are equivalent p d q p d q pp n pq n for all compositions of positive integers n fp and fq share the same finite dimensional distributions proof as indicated by kallenberg the finite dimensional distributions of f fp determine those of the list p of ranked jumps of p and conversely it is obvious that the laws of p and p determine each other and that either of these laws determines the eppf pp by application of formula 68 with p replaced by p or p that the law of p can be recovered from the partition structure was shown by kingman 1978 see also pitman 2006 theorem 3 1 for an explicit formula expressing the eppf in terms of product moments derived from p a nice exercise in kallenberg s encoding of p by an exchangeable random c d f f fp is provided by the following construction proposed by patil and taillie 1977 example 2 10 in an insightful review article which appeared a year before the general theory of partition structures was offered by kingman 1978 suppose p is a random discrete distribution with p pi 0 1 for each i 1 2 let ui be a sequence of i i d uniform variables independent of p and for each 0 p 1 consider the sequence pi 1 ui p obtained by annihilating each pi with ui p and keeping each pi with ui p then a new random discrete distribution p p called a p thinning or p screening of p is obtained by ignoring the annihilated en tries pi with ui p and listing the remaining entries of pi with pi p in their original order renormalized by their sum f p i pi 1 ui p more precisely the jth entry of p p is pj p p p j f p where p j is the jth index i with ui p so p j is the sum of j independent copies of p 1 with the geometric p distribution p p 1 k pqk 1 for q 1 p and the sequence of indices p j j 1 2 is independent of p in terms of the random c d f with ex changeable increments f u i pi 1 ui u whose jumps in some order are the pi the p thinning p p is by construction a listing of jumps of the random c d f with exchangeable increments f up f p 0 u 1 in terms of p means for suitable distributions of x the p p mean of x is the ratio of two jointly distributed 25 p means mp p x mp x 1 u p mp 1 u p ixi 1 ui p pi i 1 ui p pi 72 a particularly appealing instance of this construction is described by the following proposition proposition 6 patil and taillie 1977 theorem 2 5 ifp is governed by the gem 0 model pj hj j 1 i 1 hi for i i d random factors hi with hi d 1 for some 0 then i the random fraction f p has beta p q distribution for q 1 p ii the p thinned random discrete distribution p p has gem 0 p distribution iii the fraction f p is independent of the random discrete distribution p p proof as indicated by patil and taillie this is a consequence of the representation of p by random sampling from the random c d f f u u derived from the standard gamma subordinator see pitman 2006 4 2 for a proof of mccloskey s result that the size biased representation of jumps of this f gives p governed by the gem 0 model with i i d beta 1 distributed residual factors granted the gamma representation of p part i is just the basic beta gamma algebra 6 part ii holds by the identification of f up f p up p 0 u 1 as the c d f with exchangeable increments associated with p p part iii appeals to independence part 7 of the beta gamma algebra which makes f p p independent of the process f up f p 0 u 1 hence also independent of its list of jumps p p in their order of discovery by a process of uniform random sampling as remarked by patil and taillie the above proposition holds also with gem 0 replaced by its decreasing rearrangement the poisson dirichlet 0 distribution var ious components of the proposition can be broken down and generalized as follows proposition 7 let p p be the random discrete distribution obtained by p thinning of a random discrete distribution p with p pi 0 1 for each i 1 2 i if p p is in ranked order then so is p p ii if p p is in size biased random order then so is p p suppose p is a list of jumps of the random c d f f with exchangeable increments defined by normalization of a subordinator a say f u a u a 0 u 1 for some fixed 0 then iii p p is a list of normalized jumps of the same subordinator on the interval 0 p instead of 0 26 iv if p is in either ranked or size biased order then the following two conditions are equivalent p p d p for every 0 p 1 73 a is a stable subordinator for some 0 1 74 in which case p is governed by the gem 0 model with independent residual factors hi d 1 i for i 1 2 proof part i is obvious to see part ii observe that p p may be constructed by listing the jumps of the associated random c d f with exchangeable increments f in the order they are discovered by a process of random sampling from f but then by construction as above p p is the list of sizes of jumps of f in 0 p relative to their sum f p in the order of their discovery in samping from f but the successive values of the sample from f which fall in 0 p form a sample from f conditioned on 0 p thus p p is just the list of atoms of this random conditional distribution in their order of their discovery by a process of random sampling and it follows that p p is in size biased random order part iii is just a reprise of part ii of the previous proposition with a general subordinator instead of the gamma process as for part iv if f is derived from a stable subordinator it is easily seen that the distribution of the process f up f p a up a p 0 u 1 does not depend on p hence p p d p for either ranked or size biased ordering of p by i and ii conversely it is known pitman and yor 1992 lemma 7 5 that for a subordinator a the distribution of a 1 is determined up to a scale factor by that of the process a u a 1 0 u 1 if p p d p for all 0 p 1 then the distribution of f up f p a up a p 0 u 1 is the same for all 0 p 1 hence a p d c p a 1 for some constant c p it is well known that for a subordinator a this condition implies that a is stable with some index 0 1 as indicated in 74 the only part of proposition 6 which does not extend to a subordinator more general than the gamma process is the independence of f p and p p this is a consequence of independence of a t and a ut a t 0 u t which is well known to be a characteristic property of a t a bt for some a b 0 see pitman 2006 4 2 and work cited there see also pitman 2003 and e mery and yor 2004 for more about bridges with exchangeable increments obtained by normalizing a subordinator the construction of infinitely divisible semi stable laws by le vy 1954 58 shows for each fixed q 0 1 there exist non stable subordinators such that 73 holds if p qn for some n 1 2 but not for all 0 p 1 let p 0 denote a random discrete distribution governed by the 0 model say in size biased order for simplicity but it could just as well be ranked part iv of the above proposition implies that for each probability distribution on 0 1 which might be regarded as a prior distribution on the stability index the formula p p 0 1 d p p 0 75 defines a mixture of 0 laws which governs p with the invariance property 73 under p thinning for all 0 p 1 27 problem 8 are there any other laws besides 75 of random discrete distributions p such that p pi 0 1 for all i and p p d p for all 0 p 1 see pitman 1999 and bertoin and pitman 2000 for various constructions of p 0 governed by the 0 model as a stochastic process indexed by 0 1 4 2 p means and partition structures the present point of view is that the collection of distributions of p means mp x indexed by various distributions of x should be regarded as yet another encoding of the partition structure associated with p that point of view is justified by the following corollary of proposition 5 which does not seem to have been pointed out before call a random variable simple if it takes only a finite number of possible values corollary 9 characterization of partition structures by p means for each random discrete distribution p the collection of distributions of its p means mp x as x ranges over simple random variables is an encoding of the partition structure of p that is to say for any two random discrete distributions p and q the condition mp x d mq x for every simple x can be added to the list of equivalent conditions in the proposition 5 proof as remarked earlier around 21 it the distribution of mp x remains un changed if p is replaced by p and the same for q instead of p so p d q implies mp x d mq x for the converse the crame r wold theorem shows that the finite dimensional distributions of fp are determined by the collection of one dimensional distributions of finite linear combinations of fp 0 v 0 v 1 each of which is a p mean by application of 70 i ai fp 0 vi mp i ai 1 u vi somp x d mq x for all simplex implies that the finite dimensional distributions of fp and fq are the same hence the conclusion by the preceding proposition part of how the partition structure of p is determined by the distributions of p means mp x as the distribution of x varies is found by consideration of the p means of indicator variables x that is x 1 u v whose p mean is fp v so there is the following proposition which also does not seem to have been noticed before though it is the easiest case for an indicator variable of the general moment formula for p means due to kerov which is presented later in corollary 22 proposition 10 let f v fp 0 v be the random cumulative distribution function with exchangeable increments on 0 1 derived from a random discrete distribution p and let kn be the number of distinct values in a random sample of size n from either 28 p or from f then the nth moment of f v is a polynomial in v of degree at most n which equals the probability generating function of kn evaluated at v e f v n evkn n k 1 p kn k vk 76 where p kn k is determined by the ecpf pex of p according to the formula p kn k n 1 nk pex n 1 nk 77 where the sum is over all n 1 k 1 compositions of n into k parts consequently the collection of one dimensional distributions of kn for n 1 2 determines the collection of one dimensional distributions of f v for 0 v 1 and vice versa proof formula 76 displays two different ways of evaluating the probability of the event e 1 i n vi v for a random sample v 1 vn from f on the one hand p e f f v n on the other hand p e kn k vk because given k distinct values of the vi these values are k independent uniform 0 1 variables uj 1 j k which all fall to the left of v with probability vk it is known nacu 2006 that another equivalent condition is equality in distribution of the two sequences kn n 1 generated by sampling from p and q respectively problem 11 does equality of the one dimensional distributions of kn generated by sampling from p and q for each n imply equality of partition structures by corollary 10 this condition is the same as equality of one dimensional distri butions of fp 0 p and fq 0 p for each 0 p 1 so the issue is whether the finite dimensional distributions of an increasing process with exchangeable increments are determined by its one dimensional distributions kallenberg 1973 established a result in this vein that the distribution of any process on 0 1 with exchangeable increments and continuous paths is determined by its one dimensional distributions it appears that the distribution of an exchangeable random partition n on n with restrictions m to m for m n is determined by the collection of distributions of km the number of blocks of m for 1 m n for n 11 but not for n 12 to see this consider the part n probabilities of individual partitions of n in the distribution of the partition of n induced by the ranked block sizes of n where part n is the number of partitions of n these part n probabilities are subject only to the constraints of being non negative with sum 1 so the range of part n 1 of these probabilities contains some open ball in r part n 1 the p km k for 1 k m n then form a collection of n 1 2 linearly independent linear combinations of the part n it is easily checked that part n 1 n 1 2 for 1 n 11 but part 12 1 76 66 12 2 hence the conclusion however it does not seem at all obvious how to construct such an example which is part of an infinite partition structure derived by sampling from a random discrete distribution the following proposition develops the meaning of the terms pex n 1 nk in the sum 77 for p kn k in the context of the preceding proof 29 proposition 12 let v 1 vn be a sample from fp meaning that p ni 1 vi vi fp n i 1 fp 0 vi 0 vi 1 78 letkn be the number of distinct values among v 1 vn and letn ex n be the numbers of repetitions of these values in the sample v 1 vn in increasing order of v values then n ex n is an exchangeable random composition of n with the probability function pex featured in formulas 66 and 77 proof by construction kn is the number of blocks of n the random partition of n generated by sampling from p on the event of probability one that there are no ties among the u values the association vi uji pairs distinct v values with distinct j values in a sample j 1 jn of indices of p thus kn is the number of distinct values in a sample of size n from p and the distinct v values are the uniform order statistics u 1 kn u 2 kn ukn kn where for k 1 2 the u 1 k u 2 k uk k are the order statistics of the first k i i d uniform variables u 1 uk it is well known that ui u k i k for a random permutation k of k that is independent of these k order statistics hence n ex n is an exchangeable random composition whose probability function 66 encodes the partition structure of p 4 3 p means as conditional expectations the point of view taken here is that a random discrete distribution p may be regarded as a probabilistic mechanism for turning a suitable random variablex into another ran dom variable mp x considered in this way mp becomes an operator on random variables x whose properties are those of a conditional expectation operator in the first instance the definition mp x j xjpj makes mp an operator on proba bility distributions which converts the common distribution of x and the xj into the distribution of the new random variable mp x there is no specification of which of the many identically distributed variables xj should be regarded as x this construction of x mp x puts x on the same probability space as all the copies xj of x but the joint distribution of x and xj will typically depend on j so there is no well defined joint distribution of x and a generic representative x of the terms xj without some further precision for instance if e x 0 and ex 2 then the covariance e x xj epj ex 2 will typically depend on j only exceptionally as in the case of exchangeablep 1 pm does the joint law of x xj not depend on j for some finite range 1 j m this apparent lack of a joint distribution of x and x mp x should be contrasted with conditional expectations x e x g for g any sub field of events in a proba bility space f p on which x is defined and integrable for then x and x are 30 defined on the same probability space with an induced joint probability distribution p x x on r 2 there are however many indications in the literature of particular p means that the operation which transforms a random variable x into mp x shares properties of a conditional expectation operator e x g most obviously mp is a positive operator x 0 implies mp x 0 and mp is a linear operator meaning that if x y has some arbitrary joint distribution such that both x mp x and y mp y are well defined almost surely then the natural construction of a random pair x y mp x y using one copy of p and an i i d sequence xj yj of copies of x y makes mp ax by amp x bmp y it is also easily shown there is a monotone convergence theorem for p means with the same coupling construction 0 xn x as n implies 0 mp xn mp x a s 79 all of which supports the idea that p means should be regarded as some kind of condi tional expectation operator in fact for any prescribed distribution of x on an abstract measurable space there is the following canonical construction of x jointly with a sequence of i i d copies xj of x and a random discrete p with any desired distribu tion and a suitable field of events g which makes mp g x e g x g a s for all bounded or non negative measurable functions g assume that the xj and pj are defined together with a uniform 0 1 variable u as needed for further ran domization on some probability space f p with xj pj and u independent conditionally given xj and p pj let j be a random draw from p p j j x 1 x 2 p 1 p 2 pj j 1 2 which may be constructed in the usual way by letting j j if j 1 i 1 pi u j i 1 pi then set x xj so x is not any particular xj but x xj for j picked at random according to p independently of the entire sequence of xj values then the following proposition is easily verified proposition 13 let x xj be defined in terms of an i i d sequence xj and a random discrete distribution pj independent of xj by this canonical construction with the random index j picked according to p independently of xj then the distribution of x is the common distribution of the xj 31 for each measurable function g with e g x let the p mean of g x be defined by mp g x j 1 g xj pj then the series converges absolutely both almost surely and inl 1 andmp g x is the conditional expectation mp g x e g x x 1 x 2 p 1 p 2 a s in particular if x is real valued with e x and x mp x then e x x x so the sequence ex x x is a three term martingale consequently for each random discrete distribution of p the transformation from the distribution of x to that of its p mean x enjoys all the well known general prop erties of conditional expectation operator so p means should be properly be under stood like conditional expectations as a kind of partial averaging operator some of these properties of p means inherited from conditional expectations are listed in the following corollary recall that the convex partial order on the distributions of real valued random variables x and y with finite means is defined by x cx y iff e x e y for every convex function 80 this relation x cx y should be understood as a relation between the distributions of x and of y subject to e x and e y comparable to the usual stochastic order x d y meaning that e x e y for all bounded increasing because every convex function x is bounded below by some affine function ax b the assumption e x implies e x has a well defined value which is either finite or for every convex and similarly for y so for x and y with both e x and e y the meaning of the condition 80 can be made more precise in either of the following equivalent ways 80 holds for all convex allowing as a value on one or both sides 80 holds for all convex such that both e x and e y are finite it is known shaked and shanthikumar 2007 2 a that further equivalent conditions are ex ey and the inequality 80 holds for x x a for all a r ex ey and the inequality 80 holds for x x a for all a r 32 given some prescribed distributions on the line for x and for y a coupling of x and y is a construction of random variables x and y with these distributions on a common probability space it is a well known that x d y is equivalent to existence of a coupling of x and y with p x y 1 simply take x f 1 x u and y f 1 y u where f 1 x and f 1 y are the usual inverse distribution functions and u has uniform 0 1 distribution by jensen s inequality for conditional expectations x cx y is implied by there exists a martingale coupling of x and y that is a construction of x and y with e y x x that remark is all that is needed to deduce the following corollary from proposition 13 it is a well known result of strassen that x cx y implies the existence of a martingale coupling of x and y but the construction is quite difficult and not explicit in general see hirsch profeta roynette and yor 2011 and beiglbo ck nutz and touzi 2017 for this result and more about the convex order corollary 14 let x be a random variable with e x and let x mp x be its p mean for some random discrete distribution p then x cx x in particular i e x e x and ex ex ii if e x r for some r 1 then e x r e x r iii the distributions ofx and x cannot be the same except if either p x x 1 for some x or p pj 1 for some j 1 proof all but part iii follow immediately from proposition 13 these statements also follow from the definition x j xjpj by applying jensen s inequality j xjpj j xj pj before taking expectations as for iii it is well known durrett 2010 exercise 5 1 12 that if a martingale pair x x has x d x then p x x 1 it is easily seen that for x mp x this can only be so in one of the two exceptional cases indicated part i of this corollary and the instance of part ii for r n a positive integer can also be deduced from the formula for ex n presented later in corollary 22 part iii appears in yamato 1984 proposition 3 for the case of dirichlet 0 means as an operator mapping a distribution of x to a distribution of x one property of p means extends those of a typical conditional expectation operator the p mean of x may be well defined and finite by almost sure convergence even if e x for instance there is the following easy generalization of a result of yamato 1984 for dirichlet 0 means and van assche 1987 for the uniformly weighted mean x 1 p 1 x 2 1 p 1 for p 1 with uniform distribution on 0 1 proposition 15 suppose that x d a by for some fixed a and b and y with the standard cauchy distribution p y dy 1 1 y 2 1 dy then no matter what the random discrete distribution p the p mean x is well defined as an almost surely convergent series with x d x 33 proof this can be shown by a computation with characteristic functions after con ditioning on p as in yamato 1984 alternatively using the well known scaling property y p d py 1 of a standard cauchy process with stationary independent increments y t t 0 assumed independent of p the p mean x may be con structed as the limit of a by ji 1 pi as j it is easily seen by conditioning on p 1 p 2 that the limit exists and equals a by 1 almost surely for the case of x x 1 p 1 x 2 1 p 1 with p 1 uniform on 0 1 van assche 1987 theorem 2 obtained the conclusion of this proposition by a more complicated argument involving stieltjes transforms but he also obtained a converse the equality in distribution x d x implies that x d a by for some real a and b and y standard cauchy it appears that this converse is true under very much weaker conditions on p but some condition is required to avoid the case p 2 1 p 1 with the distribution of p 1 concentrated on terms of a geometric progression qn n 1 2 for some 0 q 1 for le vy 1954 58 established the existence of infinitely divisible semi stable laws of x such x d px 1 p x if p qn for some n besides the family of strictly stable cauchy laws ay b which is characterized by this property for all p 0 1 4 4 refinements for p and r two random discrete distributions say that r is a refinement of p if there is a coupling of p and r on a common probability space such that that both p pi and r ri may be indexed by i n 1 2 in the usual way while some rearrangement of atoms of r may be indexed by i j n 2 as ri j with pi j n ri j i n the following proposition provides a simple explanation of many monotonicity results for p means proposition 16 if r is a refinement of p then mr x cx mp x for every x with e x proof it must be shown that for arbitrary convex and x with e x e i jxi jri j e ixipi 81 where xi j i j n is a doubly indexed array of copies of x independent of r and xi i n is a singly indexed list of copies of x independent of p by conditioning on the coupling p r it is enough to establish 81 for a fixed non random discrete distribution r which is a refinement of some other fixed non random discrete distri bution p a further reduction by easy limit arguments shows it is enough to establish 81 when r has only a finite number of non zero atoms moreover by induction on the number these atoms it is enough to consider the case when only one atom of p is split to obtain r from p that case reduces easily by conditioning and scaling to the base case e mr x e x of corollary 14 34 by general theory of the convex order of distributions on the line recently reviewed by letac and piccioni 2018 the above proposition implies it is possible to realize the sequence ex mr x mp x x on a suitable probability space as a four term martingale it is well known however that the general construction of such a martingale from a sequence of distributions in creasing in the convex order is not at all explicit or elementary and the proof sketched above does not help much either so it is natural to ask if the canonical martingale construction of mp x x in proposition 13 can be extended to provide an explicit martingale mr x mp x x on a suitable probability space whenever r is a re finement of p the following argument shows how this is possible but the argument is quite tricky and it does not seem obvious how to extend it to a sequence of succes sive refinements in any nicer way than by forcing the martingale to be markovian with prescribed two dimensional laws martingale proof of proposition 16 the aim is to constructr and p jointly withx on some common probability space f p so thatmr x e x r andmp x e x p for some sub fields r p f note well that while r is a refinement of p the associated field r must be coarser than p it is possible to make such a construction quite generally but the definition of the fields involved is tricky so as in the previous proof let us rather argue that by conditioning on r p it is enough to consider the case of deterministic r and p so consider a fixed pair of discrete distributions r p and let i j be a random element of n 2 which conditionally given x xi j i j n is a pick from r p i j i j x ri j i j n 82 and set x xi j i j xi j 1 i j i j 83 to make e x x mr x i j xi jri j 84 to involve p as well for i with pi 0 let ji be a random index with the conditional distribution of j given i i that is p ji j ri j pi suppose that the ji are independent forming a sequence j ji with i ranging over i pi 0 assume further that the sequence j is independent of the double array x of copies of x now a random pair i j as in 82 and x xi j subject to 84 is conveniently constructed from the double array x of copies of x and the sequence of conditional indices j as j ji for a single random index i with p i i x j pi i n 85 so that x xi j i xi ji 1 i i 86 35 and hence e x x j mp x i xi jipi 87 where it is easily argued that xi ji is a sequence of independent copies of x with this sequence independent of p by 85 thus we obtain a coupled pair of representa tions mr x e x r and mp x e x p with r p for r the field generated by x and p generated by x and j hence the desired conclusion 81 by jensen s inequality for conditional expectations as an application of this proposition there are known constructions of the 0 model which are refining as increases gnedin and pitman 2007 for instance let vi yi be the points of a poisson process with intensity dvdy 1 v in the strip 0 v 1 0 y then let p 0 j be the length of the jth component interval of the relative complement in 0 1 of the random set of points vi 0 yi reading the intervals from left to right as shown by ignatov 1982 this construction makes p 0 j hj j 1 i 1 1 hi where the hj are i i d copies of 1 which is the characteristic property of the size biased ordering of the 0 model this construction refines the random discrete distributions p 0 as increases hence the following corollary of proposition 16 corollary 17 letac and piccioni 2018 theorem 1 2 for every x with e x as increases on 0 the family of distributions of 0 means of x is decreasing in the convex order of distributions on the line starting from the distribution of x at 0 and converging to the constant e x in the limit as see letac and piccioni 2018 for many more refined results regarding the family of dirichlet curves in the space of probability distributions on the line meaning the laws of 0 means of a fixed distribution of x as a function of it is an implica tion of corollary 17 and a well known result of kellerer discussed further in letac and piccioni 2018 2 that for each distribution of x with finite mean it is pos sible to construct a markovian reversed martingale x 0 with x 0 x and lim x ex almost surely such that x d m 0 x for each 0 however there is no known way to explicitly construct the transition kernel of such a markov process the construction indicated above gives an explicit enough process x j 1 xjp j 88 for xj i i d copies of x and p j j 1 2 the family of coupled copies of gem 0 generated by ignatov s poisson construction even for the simplest choice of bernoulli p distributed xj when we know x d p q it seems difficult to pro vide any explicit description of the joint law of x x for 0 or even to determine whether or not this process is markovian or a reversed martingale it is known however gnedin and pitman 2007 that a corresponding process of com positions of n obtained by sampling from this model is markovian with a simple 36 transition mechanism and it might be possible to proceed from this to some analysis of x 0 defined by 88 one final remark about proposition 16 the converse is completely false consider the classical example with pn the deterministic uniform distribution on n discussed further in section 4 8 it is well known that mpn x x 1 xn n is a reversed martingale for any distribution of x with e x so the distribution of mpn x is decreasing in the convex order but pn is a refinement of pm iff m divides n problem 18 what more explicit condition on a pair of random discrete distributions p and r is equivalent to mr x cx mp x for all x with a finite mean even for deterministic p and r this seems to be a non trivial problem a discus sion of various measures of diversity for random discrete distributions and concepts of comparison of p and r with respect to such measures with many references to earlier work was provided by patil and taillie 1977 that article discusses relations between four different partial orderings on distributions of random discrete distributions each of which provides some sense in which r may be stochastically more diverse than p denoted sd 2 sd 3 sd 4 sd 5 it appears that all of these orderings are implied by the ordering by refinement call it sd 1 as that notation was not used by patil and taillie and the refinement ordering sd 1 seems to be both the simplest and strongest of all these orderings already in fisher 1943 there is the idea that in his limit model for species sampling called here the 0 model the parameter 0 which fisher called not to be confused with the second parameter 0 1 of the model should be regarded as some kind of index of diversity in the random distribution of species frequencies in the population this idea was confirmed by patil and taillie 1982 theorem 2 9 according to which the 0 family is increasing in stochastic diversity according to the partial order sd 3 as discussed above the 0 family is increasing in the refinement order sd 1 hence also in all of the other orders considered by patil and taillie a sixth partial order say sd 6 defined by mr x cx mp x for all x with a finite mean is implied by sd 1 and is perhaps the same as one of partial orders proposed by patil and taillie one of these partial orders denoted sd 4 by patil and taillie is the condition that r n n i 1 r i is stochastically smaller than p n for each n r n d p n for every n 1 2 sd 4 89 that is to say for each fixed n it is possible to construct a coupling of r and p with p r n p n 1 a stronger stochastic ordering condition say sd 7 with sd 7 sd 4 is that there exists a single coupling of r and p such that p r n p n for all n 1 sd 7 90 it is easily shown that the refinement ordering sd 1 sd 7 but not conversely due to the counterexample with pn and pm mentioned above it is also the case that the two variants of the stochastic ordering condition sd 4 with different couplings for different n and sd 7 with a single coupling for all n are not equivalent this can be seen from the following simple example 37 let p p be equally likely to be 3 3 0 6 or 4 1 1 6 let r r be equally likely to be 3 2 1 6 or 4 2 0 6 then r n d p n hence r n d p n for each n 1 2 3 but it is impossible to couple p and r so that p r n p n for n 1 2 1 for p r n p n 1 and r n d p n would imply p r n p n 1 for n 1 2 hence p r n p n for n 1 2 1 hence r d p which is obviously not the case it is easily shown that if r n p n for all n then i r i 2 i p i 2 91 this is really a fact about arbitrary fixed ranked distributions which applies also to ran dom ranked distributions to see 91 for 0 1 consider the convex combination p 1 r p which is evidently another ranked discrete distribution and differentiate i p i 2 with respect to this derivative is a linear function of which is of the requisite positive sign for all 0 1 iff it is positive for 0 and 1 but that is easily checked using the condition that both p and r are ranked a connection with the convex order of means is that if x has mean 0 and finite mean square then as discussed further in section 4 7 it is easily seen that e mp x 2 e x 2 e i p 2 i 92 so a necessary condition for mr x cx mp x for all x with a finite mean is that e i r 2 i e i p 2 i 93 this is obviously implied by the existence of a coupling ofr and p with i r i 2 i p i 2 as implied by 91 but is clearly a lot weaker than that condition other necessary conditions for mr x cx mp x are implied by the generalization of 92 to higher powers presented later in corollary 22 so much remains to be clarified regarding these various orderings with respect to stochastic diversity 4 5 reversed martingales in the chinese restaurant this section which can be skipped at a first reading explains how in the canonical construction of ex mp x x as a three term martingale as in proposition 13 the x and mp x are the first term and the almost sure limit of the reversed martingale constructed in the following proposition proposition 19 let j 1 j 2 be a random sample from a random discrete distribu tion p with j 1 j 2 and p independent of the i i d sequence x 1 x 2 let j k the kth distinct value observed in the sequence j 1 j 2 with jk if there is no such value let pn k 1 n n i 1 ji j k 38 so pn pn k k 1 2 is the random empirical distribution of sample values j 1 jn reindexed by their order of appearance for a measurable function g let mpn g x k 1 g xj k pn k 1 n n i 1 g xji so in particular mp 1 g x g x for x xj 1 xj 1 then for each g with e g x the sequence of pn means mpn g x is a reversed martingale which converges both almost surely and in l 1 to mp g x k 1 g xj k pk d j 1 g xj pj proof the equality of the two expressions for mpn g x follows easily from the definitions the rest of the argument is a variation of the proof of kingman s represen tation of partition structures by aldous 1985 it is easily checked that the sequence xji i 1 2 is exchangeable so mpn g x is a reversed martingale by stan dard theory of exchangeable sequences the remaining conclusions follow easily the chinese restaurant process provides a visualization of successive random par titions generated by the cycles of random permutations n of n where n 1 is ob tained from n by inserting element n 1 into one of n 1 possible places relative to the cycles of n various aspects of this metaphor are developed in pitman 2006 3 1 in terms of chinese restaurant the random distribution pn with support 1 kn is the empirical distribution of how the first n customers are assigned to tables j for 1 j kn where kn the number of distinct values in the sample j 1 jn from p in this picture table k is brought into service when the kth distinct value j k ap pears and that kth table is labeled by the positive integer j k the n 1 th customer is given the random value jn 1 picked from p 1 p 2 and assigned to whichever table has label equal to jn 1 if that label has appeared before and otherwise if there are kn k tables in use with k different labels customer n 1 is assigned to a new table k 1 with value j k 1 jn 1 suppose that in addition to its index k in order of appearance and its label j k the kth table is assigned value xj k for x 1 x 2 an i i d sequence with values in an arbitrary measurable space independent of p and the sample j 1 j 2 from p which drives the chinese restaurant process sayxj k is the table color of the kth table brought into service in the restaurant then the se quence of table colors encountered by customers as they enter the restaurant that is xj 1 xj 2 is an exchangeable sequence of random variables which generates a partition structure which may be coarser than the partition of customers by tables if there are ties among the x values but which will be identical to the partition of cus tomers by tables if the distribution ofx is continuous so thex values are almost surely distinct note that the sequence p j j 1 2 is a size biased random permuta tion of the original random discrete distribution pj driving the chinese restaurant process by a mechanism that is independent of the x sequence 39 4 6 fragmentation operators and composition of p means pitman and yor 1996 6 introduced the composition operation on two random dis crete distributions p and q which creates a new random discrete distribution r p q as follows let p pi be independent of qi j j 1 2 a sequence of i i d copies of q and let p q denote the ranked ordering of the collection of products piqi j i 1 2 j 1 2 intuitively each atom of p is frag mented by its own copy of q and these fragments are reassembled in non increasing order to form r p q clearly r is a very special kind of refinement of p as discussed in section 4 4 the composition operation may be regarded either as an operation on ranked discrete distributions as in pitman and yor 1996 6 or on their corresponding partition structures as detailed in pitman 1999 lemma 35 independent of pi and qi j as above let xi j be an array of i i d copies of x assumed to be either bounded or non negative then m i q x j 1 xi jqi j is a sequence of i i d copies of mq x so a p mean of mq x is naturally con structed as mp mq x i 1 m i q pi 94 i 1 j 1 xi jpiqi j d mp q x 95 hence the following proposition proposition 20 the operation p q of composition of random discrete distributions p and q corresponds to composition of their mean operators mp and mq mp q x d mp mq x 96 for all bounded or non negative x consequently for three random discrete distribu tions p q and r the following two conditions are equivalent mr x d mp mq x for every x with a finite number of values r d p q proof the first sentence summarizes the preceding discussion the second sentence follows from the characterization of partition structures by their p means corollary 9 typically the operation of composition of random discrete distributions is quite difficult to describe explicitly a remarkable exception is the result of pitman and yor 40 1997 a proposition 22 that for the p governing the model there is the simple composition rule p p 0 p 0 0 1 0 97 corresponding to the identity in distribution of corresponding p means m x d m 0 m 0 x 0 1 0 98 for all bounded or non negative random variables x see pitman 2006 3 4 for an account of how the identity 97 was first discovered by a representation of the model for 0 1 and 0 as the limiting proportions of various classes of individuals in a continuous time branching process see also pitman 1999 theorem 12 for a proof of the more general result that p p p 0 1 0 1 99 which has a similar interpretation in terms of p means see also pitman 2006 5 5 for further discussion and combinatorial interpretations of 97 and 99 as indicated in section 5 7 these composition rules for means are closely related to tsilevich s formula 22 for the generalized stieltjes transform of an mean see also james et al 2008 a theorem 2 1 where a presentation of 98 was derived from tsilevich s formula 22 but the equivalence of 97 and 98 is only hinted at there by a reference to gnedin and pitman 2005 which contains related results for interval partitions and random discrete distributions derived from self similar random sets a result of pitman 1999 theorem 12 establishes a close connection between the operation of fragmentation of one random discrete distribution by another and a kind of dual coagulation operation curiously while this coagulation operation has a simple description in terms of composition of associated processes with exchangeable increments it does not seem to have any simple description in terms of p means see pitman 2006 5 and bertoin 2006 for further discussion of fragmentation and coagulation operations and associated markov processes whose state space is the set of ranked discrete distributions 4 7 moment formulas let x y mp x y be the pair of p means of two random variables x and y with some joint distribution it is a basic problem to calculate the expectation ex y in particular ex 2 in the case x y this problem was first considered by ferguson 1973 for the 0 model of p following ferguson s approach in that particular case expand the product as x y j xjpj k xkpk j xjyjp 2 j j 6 k xjyjpjpk and take expectations to conclude that ex y p 2 e xy p 1 1 e x e y 100 41 where p 2 e j p 2 j and p 1 1 e j 6 k pjpk are the two most basic partition probability formulas encoded in the eppf p derived from the random discrete distribution by 68 that is p 2 p j 1 j 2 and p 1 1 p j 1 6 j 2 for j 1 j 2 a sample of size 2 from p in the dirichlet case considered by ferguson 1973 theorem 4 p is governed by the 0 model which makes p 2 1 1 and p 1 2 1 this method extends easily to a product of three p means say x y z with a dif ferent sum appearing for each of the 5 partitions of the index set 3 according to ties between indices of summation ex y z i j k i j kdistinct i j 6 k i k 6 j j k 6 i where for instance i j 6 k e xy e z e i 6 k p 2 i pk e xy e z p 2 1 by 68 continuing to a product of n factors the corresponding moment formula is given by the following proposition this is a variant of product moment formulas due to kerov and tsilevich 2001 proposition 10 1 for the two parameter model and ishwaran and james 2003 for a general random discrete distribution p possibly even defective as in section 4 9 proposition 21 product moment formula for p means let y i 1 i n mp y 1 yn be the random vector of p means derived from some joint distribution of y 1 yn for instance if yi gi x for some sequence of measurable functions gi and some basic random variable x then y i j gi xj pj for x 1 x 2 a sequence of i i d copies of x independent of p with eppf p then assuming either the yi are either all bounded or all non negative e n i 1 y i n k 1 b 1 bk p b 1 bk k j 1 bj 101 where b is the size of block b and b e i b yi and where for each k the inner sum is over the set of all partitions of n into k blocks b 1 bk proof expand the product according to the partition generated by ties between indices for each particular partition b 1 bk the corresponding expectation is evaluated using the basic formula 68 for the eppf observe that no matter what the joint distribution of the yi if n is the random par tition generated by a sample of size n from p and the definition of the product moment 42 function b on subsets b of n is extended to a partition b 1 bk of n by k j 1 bj then the product moment formula 101 becomes simply e n i 1 y i e n 102 it is tempting to think this formula somehow evaluates e n i 1 y i by conditioning on n in a suitable construction of the product jointly with n to make e n i 1 y i n n which would obviously imply 102 however this thought is completely wrong just consider the simplest case 100 for n 2 for x y with e x e y 0 we know from examples that the distribution of x 2 can be continuous with p 1 1 0 but then there is no event e with probability p 1 1 such that e x 2 e e x e y 0 be that as it may the probabilistic form 102 of the product moment formula for p means explains why this formula reduces easily in special cases by manipulation of e n for instance if the joint distribution of y 1 yn is exchangeable then b depends only on b say b b where the definition of the moment function is extended to positive integersm by m e m i 1 yi that is the mean product of any collection ofm of the variables in this case as a function of partitions of n simplifies to b 1 bk k j 1 bj this is a symmetric function of the sizes of the blocks of n which can be evaluated by listing the sizes of these blocks in any order say n 1 n n 2 n nkn n so for exchangeable y 1 yn formula 102 becomes e n i 1 y i e kn j 1 nj kn e n i 1 i ci n 103 where m is the expected product of any m of the yi and ci n kn j 1 1 nj kn i is the number of blocks of n of size i in the important special case when yi x for every 1 i n m exm and 103 may be recognized in kerov 1998 theorem 4 2 2 in the equivalent form ex n p n n i 1 exi c i 104 where n is a random permutation of n which conditionally given n is uniformly distributed over all permutations of n whose cycle partition is n as generated by the chinese restaurant construction of n and c i is the number of cycles of size i in see also diaconis and kemperman 1996 2 where the formula 104 was first derived for the 0 model of p which generates the ewens distribution on 43 random permutations with p n n kn n 105 for kn the number of cycles of here is a version of kerov s moment formula 104 in terms of the ecpf of p as introduced in 66 corollary 22 moment formula for p means let p be a random discrete distribution with ecpf pex for every distribution of x with e x n the nth moment of x p the p mean of a sequence of i i d copies of x is finite and given by the formula ex np n k 1 n 1 nk pex n 1 nk k i 1 exni 106 where the inner sum is over all n 1 k 1 compositions of n into k parts in particular if e exp tx for t in some open interval i containing 0 as for a bounded random variable x then for every random discrete distribution p e exp tx p e exp tx for t i the distribution of x p is uniquely determined by its moment sequence 106 proof for non negative x this is read from 103 for yi x and the particular choice of the exchangeable random presentation n ex n of sizes of blocks of n then take the usual difference x x x for signed x the rest is read from corollary 14 and standard theory of moment generating functions a good check on this general moment formula forp means is provided by takingx to be the constant random variable x 1 in 106 then x 1 too and the moment formula confirms that pex n 1 nk is a probability function on compositions of n for each n as in 67 another check is provided by the classical case when p pm say is constant and equal to the uniform distribution on m the exchangeable composition probability function of n ex n is then pexm n 1 nk 1 m n m k n n 1 nk 107 the above moment formulas for p means then reduce to classical formulas for mo ments of the arithmetic mean of a sequence of i i d random variables discussed further in section 4 8 the ecpf 107 can be derived quickly as follows each of n balls indexed by 1 i n is equally likely to be painted any one of m colors j m and given there are k different colors used the clusters of balls by color are put in any one of k different orders by a uniform random permutation of k then pexm n 1 nk is the probability that the sequence of cluster sizes n 1 nk is achieved by this ran dom ordering but there are k m k different ways to choose the sequence of k different colors j 1 jk generated by this ordering and for each of these choices of k colors the probability of the achieving the counts n 1 nk by this sequence of colors is 44 the probability 1 k that the particular k colors are put in the desired order times the multinomial probability of achieving counts n 1 nk for these colors j 1 jk and count 0 for all other colors in a simple random sample with replacement of n colors from m problem 23 suppose that pex is a symmetric function of compositions n 1 nk such that for some random discrete distribution p the moment formula 106 holds for all simple random variables x if pex is known to be an ecpf then pex pexp the ecpf of p by corollary 9 but this is not very obvious algebraically what if pex is not known to be an ecpf can it still be concluded that pex pexp if not what further side conditions e g non negativity might be imposed to obtain this conclusion as a simple case in point for each m 1 2 the classical moment formula for arithmetic means shows that the moment formula 106 holds for all simple random variables x and the function pex displayed in 107 does formula 106 alone imply that pex pexm is in fact the ecpf for sampling from the uniform distribution on m for small n 1 nk 1 2 3 4 it seems easy enough to conclude that by varying the distribution of x over two values that there are enough independent linear equations to force pex n 1 nk pexp n 1 nk but as n increases it seems necessary to involve three or more values of x in which case the necessary linear independence of these equations does not seem to be obvious 4 8 arithmetic means the study of averages of i i d random variables has a long history borel and kol mogorov established almost sure convergence of x m m j 1 xj m to e x as m in this instance x m is the p mean of x for the non random weights pj 1 j m m that are uniform on the set m 1 m and it is assumed that e x characterizations of the exact distribution of x m in terms of the dis tribution of x are provided by the theory of moments moment generating functions and characteristic functions developed specifically for this purpose as described in ev ery textbook of probability theory for x with a moment generating function m g f e exp tx that is finite for t in some neighborhood of 0 the m g f of mx m is e exp tmx m e exp t m i 1 xi e exp tx m 108 from which the nth moment of mx m can be extracted by equating coefficients of tn mnex nm n t n j 0 exj j tj m 109 where tn g t is the coefficient of tn in the expansion of g t in powers of t in expanding the product of m factors on the right side of 109 each product of terms contributing to the coefficient of tn involves some subset i m with say i k 45 factors involving some tni with ni 0 for i i and ni 0 otherwise hence for all positive integers m and n the classical moment formula for the arithmetic mean of m i i d copies of some basic variable x ex nm 1 m n n k 1 n 1 nk m k n n 1 nk k i 1 e xni 110 where n 1 nk ranges over the set of n 1 k 1 compositions of n into k parts that is sequences of k positive integers with sum n the term indexed by n 1 nk is a symmetric function of n 1 nk which remains unchanged if n 1 nk is replaced by its non increasing rearrangement n 1 n k called a partition of n this partition of n is often encoded by the sequence of counts cj n i 1 1 ni j n i 1 1 n i j for 1 j n in terms of which k j cj and j jcj and the right side of 110 involves n n 1 nk k i 1 e xni n n j 1 exj j cj so the classical moment formula may be rewritten as a sum over partitions of n with a multiplicity factor counting the number of compositions for each partition or as a similar sum over permutations of n with a different multiplicity factor using the cycle structure of the permutations to index partitions of n the classical moment formula shows explicitly how the moments of x m are de termined by those of x in the first instance for x with a m g f that converges in a neighborhood of 0 but then by standard arguments involving formal power series the formula holds also for every x with e x n instances and applications of this formula are well known for instance the case n 2 of 110 gives ex 2 m e x 2 m if e x 2 and e x 0 111 hence the weak law of large numbers for such x by chebychev s inequality and the case n 4 of 110 gives ex 4 m 1 m 4 me x 4 3 m 2 e x 2 2 if ex 4 and e x 0 112 hence the strong law of large numbers for such x by chebychev s inequality and the borel cantelli lemma durrett 2010 theorem 2 3 5 the classical moment formula 110 and its variant with summation over partitions have been known for a long time it was used already by markov in one of the first proofs of the central limit theorem see e g uspensky 1937 appendix ii it was also used by nelson 1967 to establish the gaussian nature of increments in his proof of le vy s martingale characterization 46 of brownian motion see also ferger 2014 for a recent discussion without acknowl edgement of the classical literature the above derivation of moments of the arithmetic mean x m of a sequence of i i d copies of x can be adapted to p means by first conditioning on p this gives e x np e e x np p n t n e j 1 1 pje x t 1 p 2 j e x 2 t 2 2 now the coefficient of tn involves expanding the infinite product picking out some finite number k of the factors say those indexed by ji factors of tni with ni 0 for 1 i k and then summing over all choices of j 1 jk and all compositions n 1 nk of n this provides another proof of the moment formula for p means 106 4 9 improper discrete distributions kingman 1978 showed that to provide a general representation of sampling consistent families of random partitions of positive integers n it is necessary to treat not just sampling from random discrete distributions pi with pi 0 and i pi 1 but also to consider sampling from pi with pi 0 and i pi 1 this more general model may be interpreted to mean that the pi with pi 0 are the jumps of some random distribution function f but that f may also have a continuous component whose total mass is the defect p 1 i pi 0 113 call p proper iff p 0 and defective or improper if p 0 it was shown in pitman 1999 proposition 26 how improper random discrete distributions arise naturally in the study of random coalescent processes see mo hle 2010 3 and work cited there for more recent developments in this vein kerov 1998 indicated the right generalization of the definition of the p mean mp x to defective random discrete distributions p restrict discussion to x with e x and set mp x j xjpj p ex 114 for xj as usual a sequence of i i d copies ofx this definition is justified by the way that defective distributions of p arise as weak limits of proper discrete distributions for instance if pm is the uniform distribution on m as in the previous section then pm d p 0 0 as m in the sense of convergence of finite dimensional distributions in this case the limit p has p 1 and kolmogorov s law of large numbers gives mpm x m 1 m i 1 xi e x almost surely this justifies the definition 114 in the extreme case pj 0 and p 1 more generally it is known pruitt 1966 that if an k is a toeplitz summation matrix i e limn an k 0 for each k limn k an k 1 and k an k is bounded in n and x n k an kxk then for any non degenerate distribution of x with e x there is convergence 47 x n e x in probability iff maxk an k 0 as n as an easy consequence of this fact there is the following proposition whose proof is left to the reader proposition 24 assumee x let pn be a sequence of proper discrete distribu tions with p n d p meaning that the finite dimensional distributions of p n converge in distribution to those of p for p some possibly improper random discrete distri bution then mpn x d x mp x defined by 114 moroever this conclusion continues to hold for a sequence of possibly defective discrete distribution pn provided 114 is taken as the definition of mpn x in other words for x with e x the definition 114 is the only definition of mp x which agrees with the definition in the proper case and which makes p 7 mp x weakly continuous as a mapping from laws of possibly defective random ranked discrete distributionsp to laws ofmp x beware that the above proposition is false if the assumption p n d p is replaced by pn d p just take pn to be certain to be a unit mass at n then pn d 0 0 but mpn x d x for every n which does not converge to ex unless x is constant for more about improper discrete distributions and the tricky issue of extending the notion of a size biased permutation to this case see gnedin 1998 5 models for random discrete distributions this section recalls some of the basic models for random discrete distributions these models all arose from applications of random discrete distributions and spurred the development of a general theory of distributions of p means and its relation to partition structures 5 1 residual allocation models consideration of p means by splitting off the first term suggests that their study should be simplest for those p which can be presented in some order by a residual allocation model or stick breaking scheme involving a recursive splitting like 9 that is as suming the terms of p have already been put in the right order for such a recursion there is the stick breaking representation pj hj i 1 i 1 1 hi j 1 2 115 for a sequence of independent stick breaking factors hi with hi 0 1 freedman 1963 studied bayesian estimation for such p given a sample j 1 jn from p assuming the stick breaking representation 115 for hi such that h 1 hn hn 1 hn 2 are independent for some fixed n 0 freedman called such distributions of p tail free gnedin et al 2010 provide an extensive account of the distribution theory of a 48 sample j 1 jn from a residual allocation model with i i d factors calling this model for j 1 jn the bernoulli sieve assuming the stick breaking form 115 forp p 1 p 2 derived from h 1 h 2 let r r 1 r 2 be the residual random discrete distribution defined derived correspondingly from h 2 h 3 then assuming only that h 1 is independent of h 2 h 3 for mp x the p mean of a sequence of i i d copies of x there is the decomposition mp x d p 1 x 1 1 p 1 mr x 116 where on the right side p 1 x 1 and mr x are independent with x 1 d x the case of independent stick breaking when p 1 d r s for some r s 0 is of particular interest due to the ease of computation of moments of mp x in this case multiply 116 by an independent r s variable and appeal to the beta gamma algebra 7 to see that 116 for p 1 d r s implies r smp x d rx 1 smr x where on the right side x 1 and mr x are independent independent also of r and s which are independent gamma variables with the indicated parameters in terms of moment generating functions this becomes e exp r smp x e exp rx 1 e exp smr x that is by conditioning on all except the gamma variables e 1 mp x r s e 1 x 1 re 1 mr x s 117 for instance if xp 1 u p is an indicator variable of an event with probabilty p and p 1 d r s is independent of the residual fractions r 2 r 3 then e 1 mp xp r s 1 p p 1 r e 1 mr xp s 118 formula 117 is a generalization of proposition 3 of hjort and ongaro 2005 which is the particular case with r 1 and s 0 of greatest interest in bayesian non parametric inference see also proposition 4 of hjort and ongaro 2005 which gives the corresponding expression in terms of moments for an i i d stick breaking scheme with factors hi d p 1 for all i formula 116 holds withr d p implying that the distribution of x mp x solves the stochastic equation x d p 1 x 1 p 1 x 119 where on the right side p 1 x and x are independent as shown by feigin and tweedie 1989 and diaconis and freedman 1999 this stochastic equation uniquely deter mines the distribution of x under mild regularity conditions see hjort and ongaro 2005 proposition 9 regarding the important case of the 0 model with p 1 d 1 for some 0 49 5 2 normalized increments of a subordinator a well known method of construction of random discrete distributionsp p 1 p 2 is to start from a sequence of non negative random variables a 1 a 2 and then normalize these variables by their sum a p 1 p 2 1 a a 1 a 2 where a i 1 ai 120 here it is assumed that p a 0 1 which provided p ai 0 0 for some i can always be arranged by conditioning on the event a 0 say p 1 p 2 is derived from increments of a subordinator a r 0 r where 0 if a is an increasing process with stationary independent increments and the ai are the independent increments of a over consecutive intervals of lengths i with i i the normalizing factor a in 120 is then a a a closely related but more important construction with the same normalizing fac tora is obtained by supposing thatai ai in 120 are some exhaustive list of the jumps a r a r a r with a r 0 and 0 r for a subordinator with no drift component meaning that almost surely a 0 r a r i 1 ai 121 precise definition of the ai and the corresponding pi in 120 requires an order ing for these jumps however according to corollary 9 the distribution of p means mp x and all other aspects of the partition structure derived from p do not depend on what ordering of jumps is chosen as shown by le vy s analysis of occupation times of brownian motion it may be possible to identify the distributions of various p means by suitable decompositions like 12 even without fully specifying the ordering in a construction of p from a countable collection of interval lengths historically this was done by le vy and lamperti decades before analysis of the size biased orderings of jumps of a subordinator by mccloskey and the ranked jumps by ferguson and klass 1972 and kingman 1975 according to the le vy ito theory of subordinators the jumps ai in 121 are the points of a poisson point process on 0 n 0 r 1 ar i 1 1 ai 122 with intensity measure for some le vy measure on 0 which is uniquely determined by the le vy khintchine representation of the laplace exponent of the sub ordinator 0 1 e x dx 0 123 with e exp a t exp t t 0 0 124 50 the joint law of ranked jumps a is then easily read from the poisson description of the associated counting process 122 as detailed in ferguson and klass 1972 more or less explicit descriptions of the finite dimensional distributions of p j j 1 2 are known see pitman and yor 1997 a proposition 22 which reviews earlier work on ranked discrete distributions but to derive partition probabilities or distribu tions of p means ranked discrete distributions are impossible to work with for such purposes a much better ordering is the size biased ordering p introduced in this set ting by mccloskey 1965 mccloskey imagined each ai to be a poisson intensity rate of trapping called the abundance of some species labeled by i in a species sam pling model driven by a collection of independent poisson point processes of random rates ai for some fixed parameter value 0 mccloskey showed that for ai the jumps of a standard gamma process r 0 r in the size biased order of their discovery in the poisson species sampling model the resulting random discrete distribution p has i i d beta 1 distributed residual fractions and that beta 1 is the only possible distribution of i i d residual fractions which generates a random dis crete distribution with its components in size biased random order later work showed that this gem 0 model for p introduced by mccloskey is the size biased presen tation of limit frequencies associated with the limit model proposed earlier by fisher 1943 with partition probabilities governed by the ewens sampling formula before discussing the gem 0 this model in more detail the following proposition presents a fundamental connection between the more elementary model 120 with p 1 p 2 the normalized increments of some subordinator a over some fixed sequence of in tervals of lengths i with i i and the model obtained from the same subordi nator by some ordering of its relative jump sizes proposition 25 let p j 1 yj pj be the random probability measure on an abstract space s s defined as in 2 by assigning i i d random locations yi to each normalized jump pi of a subordinator up to time then for every ordered partition s 1 s 2 of s into disjoint measurable subsets with p yj si i there is the equality in distribution of discrete random distributions on the positive integers p si i 1 2 d ai i a i 1 2 125 where on the right side the ai ii are the independent increments of the subordinator a over a partition of 0 into a succession of disjoint intervals of lengths i with i i that is ai i a i h 1 i a i 1 h 1 i proof this is a straightforward consequence of standard marking and thinning prop erties of poisson point processes which make the ti ai yi the points of a poisson process on 0 0 s with intensity dt da p y ds where ti is the arrival time in 0 of the jump of the subordinator with magnitude a ti a ti ai this proposition yields a fairly explicit description of the finite dimensional dis tributions of the random measure p on s as well as the distribution of various p means 51 corollary 26 let p pj j 1 2 be the sequence of normalized jumps of a subordinator a r 0 r governed by a le vy measure with infinite total mass then every discrete random variable x i aixpi with distinct possible values xi and xpi the bernoulli pi indicators of disjoint events x xi with pi p x xi subject to i pi 1 the distribution of mp x the p mean of a sequence of i i d copies of x independent of p is determined by the equality in distribution mp ixixpi d 1 a i xiai pi 126 where the right side is a corresponding normalized linear combination of independent increments ai pi of the subordinator a over a partition of 0 into disjoint inter vals as in 125 if x has an infinite number of possible values 126 means that if either side is well defined by almost sure absolute convergence then so is the other and the distributions of both sides are equal proof the case of a finite sum is read immediately from the previous proposition the case of infinite sums then follows by an obvious approximation argument these distributions of p means can be described much more explicitly in the par ticular cases of gamma and stable subordinators as discussed further below see also regazzini lijoi and pru nster 2003 regarding more general subordinators 5 3 dirichlet distributions and processes the model for a random discrete distribution derived from normalized increments of a subordinator is of special interest for the standard gamma subordinator a r r for r 0 defined by the standard gamma density 4 the convolution property of gamma distributions that r s d r s for independent gamma variables of the indicated parameters r s 0 is part of the basic beta gamma algebra 6 7 which underlies all the following calculations with the gamma process first of all this property allows the construction of the standard gamma subordinator with stationary independent increments for any subordinator a it is known sato 1999 corollary 8 9 that for each continuity point 0 of its le vy measure the restriction of to is the weak limit as r 0 of the same restriction of the measure r 1 p a r for the gamma density 4 in this limit there is the pointwise convergence of densities at each x 0 p r dx r xr 1 e x r r x 1 e x as r 0 because r r r 1 1 1 this identifies the le vy measure of the gamma process dx x 1 e x 1 x 0 dx 127 52 hence the le vy khintchine exponent 0 1 e x x 1 e xdx log 1 0 128 which is a frullani integral the corresponding laplace transform is obtained more easily by integration with respect to the gamma r density 4 e exp exp 1 0 0 129 the negative binomial expansion of this laplace transform in powers of encodes the moments of n 0 e n n n n 0 n n n 1 1 0 130 hence by equating coefficients of n the list of integer moments of a gamma variable e n n n n i 1 i 1 n 0 1 2 131 apart from the last equality this moment evaluation holds also for all real n by direct integration and the definition of the gamma function easily from 131 by beta gamma algebra or by direct integration there is the corresponding beta moment formula e nr s 1 r s m r n s m r s n m 132 where for non negative integers r and s the right side involves just factorial powers of r s and r s and the formula extends to all real n r andm s with the general definition 131 of the pochhammer symbol n this pochhammer symbol appearing in most formulas involving dirichlet distributions with total weight is often best understood through beta gamma algebra as the nth monent of a gamma variable that is the magic multiplier which makes the dirichlet components independent the dirichlet distribution of p with weights 1 2 is the distribution obtained as pi ai a from the normalized subordinator increments construction 120 with independent ai d i for some i 0 with i i 0 so a d the finite dirichlet 1 m distribution of p is the distribution of p 1 pm on the m simplex m i 1 pi 1 so obtained by taking i 0 for i m this distribution can be characterized in a number of different ways for instance by the joint density of p 1 pm 1 at u 1 um 1 relative to lebesgue measure in rm 1 which is p p 1 dui 1 i m 1 1 m i 1 u i 1 i 1 0 ui 1 n i 1 ui 1 53 or by its product moments e m i 1 pnii m i 1 i ni n for ni i with m i 1 ni n which are easily obtained by beta gamma algebra like the case 132 for m 2 the symmetric dirichlet distribution with total weight denoted here by dirichlet m is the particular case with i m for 1 i m as examples the distribution of the m consecutive spacings between order statistics of m 1 independent uniform 0 1 variables is the dirichlet m m distribution with m weights equal to 1 for any integer composition m 1 mk ofm a finite dirichlet m 1 mk random vector can then be constructed from suitable disjoint sums of terms in a dirichlet m m random vector by property ii in the following proposition this proposition summarizes some well known properties of the dirichlet model for p proposition 27 let p pj j 1 have the dirichlet distribution with weights 1 2 defined by the normalization pj aj as in 120 for a sequence of independent gamma j variables aj with total j aj for a set of positive integers b let p b j b pj then i the sequence of ratios p 1 p 2 is independent of the total ii for each partition of positive integers into a finite number of disjoint subsets b 1 bm the distribution of p bi 1 i m is the finite dirichlet p bi 1 i m distribution on the m simplex iii in particular the distribution of p b is beta p b p b iv this model is identical to the residual allocation model 115 with independent beta distributed factors hj d j j with j j i 1 i j 1 i 2 133 proof straightforward applications of the basic beta gamma algebra 6 7 these definitions and properties of dirichlet distributions allow proposition 25 and its corollary to be combined and restated as follows for the dirichlet random discrete distributions on abstract spaces introduced by ferguson 1973 proposition 28 let p j 1 yj pj be the random probability measure on an abstract space s s defined as in 2 by assigning i i d random locations yj to each normalized jump pj of a standard gamma subordinator up to time then for every ordered partition s 1 s 2 of s into disjoint measurable subsets with 54 p yj si i the sequence p si i 1 has the dirichlet distribution with parameters i i 1 that is p s 1 p s 2 d 1 1 1 2 2 134 where the i i are the independent gamma i distributed increments of the gamma subordinator over a partition of 0 into disjoint intervals of lengths i moreover for each discrete distribution of x i aixpi as in 126 there is the particular case of 126 mp i aixpi d 1 i ai i pi 135 where p is a random discrete distribution defined by any exhaustive listing of the normalized jumps pj of a standard gamma subordinator up to time 5 4 finite dirichlet means as a general remark if thexi in a random average x ixipi are either constants or made so by conditioning say xi xi for some bounded sequence of numbers xi then as xi ranges over bounded sequences the collection of distributions of x or a suitable collection of moments or transforms of those distributions provides an encoding of the joint distribution of random weights pi this approach works very nicely for the dirichlet model proposition 29 von neumann 1941 watson 1956 for each fixed sequence of non negative coefficients x 1 xm and p 1 pm with dirichlet 1 m distribution with m i 1 i the distribution of the finite dirichlet mean m i 1 xipi is uniquely determined by the following laplace transform of m i 1 xipi for with gamma distribution independent of p 1 pm e exp i xipi e 1 i xipi i 1 xi i 136 for 1 with the left side regarded as the multivariate laplace transform of the random vector p 1 pm with arguments x 1 xm this formula uniquely characterizes the dirichlet 1 m distribution of p 1 pm proof after multiplying both sides of 136 by an independent variable the beta gamma algebra makes the pi a collection of independent gamma i variables hence i xipi i xi i i 137 for independent i i with sum as above hence by taking laplace transforms e exp i xipi i e exp xi i i 138 55 condition on all the pi and integrate out the gamma variables using the laplace trans form 129 to obtain the two further expressions in 136 for each fixed choice of coefficients xi this formula determines the laplace transform of i xipi hence the distribution of i xipi hence also the distribution of the finite dirichlet mean i xipi by lemma 4 the basic dirichlet mean transform 136 has a long history dating back to von neu mann 1941 who gave a more complicated derivation in the case of particular interest in mathematical statistics with parameters i ki 2 for some positive integers ki with m i 1 ki k when pi 1 i m d ai 1 i m a for a sequence of independent random variables ai d 2 ki d 2 ki 2 and a m i 1 ai d 2 k d 2 k 2 where 2 k d k i 1 z 2 i for a sequence of i i d standard gaussian variables zi so in this instance which provided the original motivation for study of the finite dirichlet distribution in mathematical statistics i xipi is the ratio of two dependent quadratic forms in a sequence of k i i d standard gaussian variables as observed by von neumann for half integer i the basic beta gamma algebra behind the above formulas especially the key independence 7 of the dirichlet distributed ratios and their gamma distributed denominator follows from the symmetry of the joint distribution of the underlying gaussian variables in rk with respect to orthonormal transformations watson 1956 gave the simple general argument indicated above using beta gamma algebra watson also supposed each j to be a multiple of 1 2 but his argument gen eralizes immediately to general i as above watson indicated how the same method yields a transform of the joint law of any finite number of linear combinations of dirich let variables simply take 1 and xj i ti j xi jdj in 136 to obtain a joint laplace transform of i j xi jdj 1 i m for any matrix of real coefficients xi j 1 i m 1 j k this trick of turning what looks at first like a univariate transform into a multivariate transform has been rediscovered many times often with out recognizing that it can done so simply by a change of variables see also mauldon 1959 weisberg 1971 diniz et al 2002 for detailed studies of the distributions and joint distributions of linear combinations of dirichlet variables motivated by applica tions to linear combinations of order statistics and their spacings the above proposition was formulated for a fixed sequence of coefficients x 1 xm but a corresponding result for random coefficients x 1 xm follows immediately by conditioning corollary 30 let x 1 xm be a sequence of random variables independent of p 1 pm with dirichlet 1 m distribution with m i 1 i then the distribution of the random dirichlet mean ixipi is uniquely determined by the following laplace transform for independent of p 1 pm and 0 e exp ixipi e 1 ixipi e i 1 xi i 139 56 if the xi are independent this holds with e i replaced by i e in the right most expression in particular if the xi are i i d copies of x so mp x ixipi is the p mean of x for this dirichlet distribution of p then e exp mp x e 1 mp x i e 1 x i 140 as a special case for x m the p mean of x for p p 1 pm with the symmetric dirichlet m distribution with total weight e exp x m e 1 x m e 1 x m m 141 to illustrate the basic transform 141 of the distribution of a symmetric dirichlet mean observe that for a b 0 the beta a b distribution is characterized by x d a b e 1 x a b 1 a 142 hence easily from 141 x d a b x m m a b d ma mb 143 in the particular case a b 1 2 for the symmetric dirichlet m m mean of i i d copies of x with the arcsine distribution of 1 2 1 2 the implication in 143 was established in roozegar and soltani 2014 by a more difficult argument involving stieltjes transforms see also homei 2017 where the same case is derived by moment calculations involving the instance for dirichlet m m of the general moment formula 106 for p means to illustrate 143 for 0 p 1 and q 1 p if a unit interval is cut into m segments bym 1 independent uniform cut points and a beta p q distributed fraction of each segment is painted red independently from one segment to the next then the total length of red segments has beta mp mq distribution 5 5 infinite dirichlet means the extension of the basic transforms of corollary 30 from finite to infinite dirichlet means is surprisingly easy corollary 31 infinite dirichlet mean transform cifarelli and regazzini 1990 for every non negative random variable x and p 0 the random discrete distribution de rived from the normalized jumps of standard gamma process on 0 the distribution of the distribution of the p 0 mean x 0 of x is uniquely determined by the laplace transform of x 0 for independent of x 0 according to the formula for 0 e exp x 0 e 1 x 0 exp e log 1 x 144 57 for unboundedx 0 this formula should be read with the convention 1 e 0 implying p x 0 1 or 0 according as e log 1 x or 145 proof suppose first thatx is a simple random variablex m i 1 xixpi for bernoulli pi indicators xpi of m disjoint events with probabilities pi i proposition 28 gives x 0 d i xipi for p 1 pm with the finite dirichlet distribution with parameters pi 1 i m so proposition 29 gives e exp x 0 e 1 i xipi i 1 xi pi exp i pi log 1 xi exp e log 1 x this is 144 for simple non negative x the case of general x 0 follows by taking simple xn with 0 xn x and appealing to the monotone convergence theorem for p means 79 corollary 32 feigin and tweedie 1989 for a general distribution of x for each fixed 0 the 0 mean x 0 of x is well defined by almost sure absolute conver gence iff e log 1 x see also sethuraman 2012 for a nice proof of this result without use of transforms the problem of inverting the transform 144 to obtain more explicit formulas for the distribution of a 0 mean x 0 has attracted a great deal of attention one of the first appearances of the right side of formula 144 in connection with the distribution of a 0 mean x 0 is in hannum et al 1981 theorem 2 5 where for x with e x it is shown that for each real x the formula tx t exp e log 1 it x x t r 146 with log 1 iv log 1 v 2 i for arctan v 147 defines the characteristic function of a random variable tx which is a limit in distri bution of a linear combination of independent gamma variables with suitable dirichlet distributed weights provided p x x 1 the distribution of t x is continuous and such that p x 0 x p tx 0 148 the c d f of x 0 is therefore determined by inversion of the characteristic function 146 something missing in this discussion of hannum et al 1981 identification t x x 0 x for independent of x 0 149 58 which is evident by inspection of formula 144 for it this observation makes both the identity 148 and the continuity of the distribution of t x completely obvious it is also clear from corollary 32 that this description of the distribution of x 0 is valid for anyx with e log 1 x closely related generalized stieltjes transforms of the distribution of x 0 appear also in cifarelli and regazzini 1990 with references to earlier work by those authors for a later treatment with further references and explicit inversion formulas for the density of x 0 see regazzini et al 2002 proposition 2 which is a fourier variant of corollary 31 with subsequent analysis involving 148 and inversion of the fourier transform 146 surprisingly none of the above references mention the simple interpretation 149 of t x 5 6 the two parameter model as recalled in section 2 7 following the initial development of the basic infinite dirich let model with a single parameter by fisher who used instead of for the param eter subsequent work of mccloskey ewens ferguson and engen and the work of le vy lamperti dynkin and others on last exit times and occupation times of various stochastic processes related to the stable subordinator of index 0 1 perman pitman and yor 1992 developed the two parameter extension of these basic models for random discrete distributions the partition structure of this model was de scribed by pitman 1995 following which pitman and yor 1997 a gave an account of the corresponding ranked discrete distributions and tsilevich 1997 characterized the distributions of p means for the complete range of parameters the model is most easily described by a residual allocation model 115 for generating its size biased permutation p commonly known as the gem distribution this is obtained by the particular choice of distributions for independent factors hi with hi d 1 i i 1 2 150 the corresponding eppf is known to be p n 1 nk k 1 i 1 i k i 1 1 ni 1 1 n 1 151 it is easily shown that this eppf corresponds to the above choice of beta distributed factors in the residual allocation model and that this choice leads to a well defined random discrete distribution p iff one of following three cases obtains see pitman 2006 3 1 for details and references to original sources gem m size biased dirichlet m this is the case m 0 for some positive integer m and 0 with the convention pj hj 0 for j m this distribution of p 1 pm is the size biased random permutation of the symmetric dirichlet m model gem 0 size biased dirichlet this is the case 0 and 0 which is the weak limit of the dirichlet m model as m in this model pj 0 a s for all j if 0 statistical aspects of this limit process were first considered by fisher 1943 as first shown by mccloskey the gem 0 model is the size biased 59 ordering of relative sizes of jumps of the standard gamma process on 0 relative to their gamma distributed total this is also the size biased distribution of atom sizes of any dirichlet random measure governed by a continuous measure with total weight the corresponding partition structure is governed by the ewens sampling formula gem size biased stable model derived from a stable subordinator this is the case 0 1 and with pj 0 a s for all j this case has special subcases as follows 0 this model with 0 is the size biased ordering of relative sizes of jumps of a stable process of index on 0 s for any fixed time s equivalently in distribution an interval partition of 0 1 may be created by the collection of maximal open intervals in the complement of the range of the stable subordi nator relative to 0 1 then the gem 0 distributed pj may be obtained either as a size biased ordering of the lengths of these intervals or by letting p 1 be the last meander interval with right end 1 and size biasing the order of the rest of the intervals this case with 0 1 is derived from the previous construction by conditioning the stable subordinator to hit the point 1 so there is no last interval rather an exchangeable interval partition whose lengths in size biased order are gem equivalently this is the sequence of lengths of excursions in size biased random order for the excursions of a bessel bridge of dimension 2 2 from 0 0 to 1 0 m for m 1 2 this model is obtained from the 0 model by deleting the first m values pj 1 j m and renormalizing the residual values pm 1 pm 2 by their sum 1 m i 1 pi or by the same scheme starting from the model associated with the excursions of a bessel bridge of di mension 2 2 after deleting the first m 1 values pj 1 j m 1 and renormalizing the residual values for 0 this model model can be obtained by first splitting 0 1 into subintervals by gem 0 that is by i i d beta 1 stick breaking then splitting each of these subintervals independently according to gem 0 the result is an interval partition of 0 1 meaning that the interval lengths in size biased order form a gem with 0 there is no known construction of gem of a comparable kind for general 0 1 and the gem model for generating p and a random sample from p from which the partition structure is created is absolutely continuous relative to the gem 0 model with density factor c s where s the diversity of p is the almost sure limit of kn n as n for kn the number of distinct elements in a sample of size n from p and c 1 1 is a normalization constant so if e is the expectation operator governing p as a gem and a sample j 1 j 2 60 from p then for every non negative random variable y which is a measurable function of p and the sample j 1 j 2 from p e y c e 0 y s 152 in the 1990 s this model for a random discrete distribution p and its asso ciated partition structures and p means were extensively studied in a series of articles cited in section 5 6 since around 2000 the merits of this model for a random discrete distribution p have been widely acknowledged and there is by now a substan tial literature of developments and applications of this model in various contexts as mentioned in the introduction 5 7 two parameter means looking at the general moment formula for p means 106 it is evident that this for mula will simplify greatly if the eppf factors as p n 1 nk v k c n k i 1 w ni 153 for some pair of weight sequences v k k 1 2 and w m m 1 2 for then by 66 the corresponding ecpf factors as pex n 1 nk v k k c n n k i 1 w ni ni 154 it was shown by kerov 2005 that apart from some degenerate limit cases the only eppfs of the form 153 defined for all positive integer compositions and subject to the consistency constraint 69 for all n are those in displayed in 151 corresponding to a random discrete distribution p whose size biased presentation follows the gem residual allocation model 150 assuming that 154 is an eppf which we know is possible for suitable choices of weights v k w n and c n the general moment formula 106 reduces easily to the identity c n n e x n n k 1 v k k m 1 w m m e y m k 155 introducing the generating functions c t 1 n 1 c n n tn v s 1 k 1 v k k sk w t m 1 w m m tm formula 155 is the identity of coefficients of n in ec x v ew x 156 61 which for x x 1 gives c v w v w 157 thus the general formula 106 for moments of p means has the following corollary corollary 33 composite moment formula for means tsilevich 1997 for any presentation of an eppf in the product form 153 for some sequences of weights v k and w n with exponential generating functions v and w as above these generating functions are convergent in some neighborhood of the origin and for each bounded random variable x the distribution of the mean x is the unique distribution whose positive integer moments are determined by the identity of formal power series in e v w x v ew x 158 to check the claim of convergence of the generating functions it seems necessary to check case by case as below but this composite moment formula for means provides a remarkable unification of a number of different formulas that were first discovered in the special cases listed below this composite moment formula for p means is a variation of the compositional or faa di bruno formula which shows how the coefficients c n of the composite function c v w are determined the two weight sequences v k and w m see pitman 2006 1 2 consider the product n 1 nk v k k i 1 w ni appearing in 153 without the factor of c n in the denominator starting from any two sequences of weights v k and w m such that this product is non negative for all n 1 nk the compositional formula 157 determines the sequence of non negative coefficients c n that is necessary to make p n 1 nk n 1 nk c n the eppf of some exchangeable random partition n of n for each n however for these n to be derived by sampling from some random discrete distribution p it is necessary that they be consistent as n varies in the sense of 69 and it is this consistency requirement that limits the scope of application of the composite moment formula to the model the simplest algebraic form of the eppf 151 is obtained for 6 0 and 6 0 by writing it as p n 1 nk 1 k k n k i 1 ni 6 0 6 0 159 which allows the product form 153 to be achieved by what appears to be the simplest possible choice of weights that is w m m n 1 i 0 i 1 mm m 160 v k 1 k k 1 kk k 161 c n n 162 62 the corresponding exponential generating functions then all simplify by negative bi nomial expansions w t m 1 m m tm 1 t 1 163 v s k 1 k k sk 1 s 164 c t n 0 n n tn 1 t 165 which magically combine as they must according to the composite formmula 157 v w t 1 1 t 1 1 t c t this argument simplifies a similar argument due to tsilevich 1997 by working con sistently with compositions rather than partitions of n a puzzling feature of the ar gument is that for 0 1 there is no obvious interpretation of the weight se quence w m m in probabilisitic or combinatorial terms due to negativity of the weight for m 1 this is compensated by the alternating sign in the definition of v k which ensures that the product 153 is positive as it must be for all compositions of positive integers n 1 nk still the result of this algebraically simple calcula tion is a remarkable unified formula for what appear at first to be extremely different cases of the model that is the elementary symmetric dirichlet m case with only a finite number m of positive pi and the fat tailed models for 0 1 corollary 34 generic cauchy stieltjes transform tsilevich 1997 suppose that either m for some m 1 2 or 0 1 and with 6 0 then for any distribution of x 0 the distribution of x the mean of x is uniquely determined by the formula e 1 x e 1 x 6 0 6 0 0 166 also for 6 0 6 0 and all x with e x n for some n 1 2 the nth moment of x is well defined and given by the equality of coefficients of n in the formal power series n n ex n n j 1 j j j 1 1 1 e x j 167 and for 0 1 and arbitrary x is finite with probability one for all if ex x is infinite with probability one for all if ex 63 proof formula 166 is read from corollary 33 in the first instance for bounded x when the convergence of all power series is easily justified the formula then extends to unbounded x 0 by monotone convergence using the consequence of proposition 13 that p means x and y of x and y with 0 x y can always be constructed as x xj y yj for xi yi a sequence of i i d copies of x y it follows easily that if e x n for some n 1 2 then the nth moment of x is well defined and can be evaluated as indicated by equating coefficients in the formal power series the conclusions regarding finiteness of x follow similarly by monotone approximation in the first instance for and for 0 1 and with 6 0 then also for 0 by the result of pitman and yor 1997 a that for each fixed 0 1 the laws of gem distributions are mutually absolutely continuous as varies two checks on formula 166 are provided as follows one check is the finite symmetric dirichlet case with 0 and m for some m 1 2 when 166 reduces to the symmetric dirichlet mean transform 141 another check is provided by the case when for simple x it reduces to a formula of barlow et al 1989 the infinite dirichlet mean transform 144 is the limit case for fixed and m 0 as m as already indicated around 144 next the limit case for 0 1 0 corollary 35 for 0 1 and x 0 if ex then the distribution of x 0 is determined by the transform e log 1 x 0 1 log e 1 x 0 1 0 168 which admits the alternative form e 1 x 0 1 e 1 x 1 e 1 x 0 1 0 169 observe that 169 for x xp the indicator of an event of probability p reduces to lamperti s stieltjes transform 20 for the generalized arcsine law with probability density 19 the case of 169 for simple x is due to barlow et al 1989 while while 168 was first indicated by tsilevich 1997 for simple x each of 168 and 169 follows easily from the other by differentiation or integration of the power series these formulas for general x 0 are obtained by increasing approximation with simple x as in the proof of corollary 34 acknowledgement thanks to lancelot james wenpin
