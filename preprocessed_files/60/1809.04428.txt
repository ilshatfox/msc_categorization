convergence of jump processes with stochastic intensity to brownian motion with inert drift submitted to bernoulli convergence of jump processes with stochastic intensity to brownian motion with inert drift clayton barnes 1 1 e mail cbarnes campus technion ac il consider a random walker on the nonnegative lattice moving in continuous time whose positive transition in tensity is proportional to the time the walker spends at the origin in this way the walker is a jump process with a stochastic and adapted jump intensity we show that upon brownian scaling the sequence of such processes converges to brownian motion with inert drift bmid bmid was introduced by frank knight in 2001 and generalized by white in 2007 this confirms a conjecture of burdzy and white in 2008 in the one dimensional setting keywords brownian motion discrete approximation random walk local time 1 introduction brownian motion with inert drift bmid is a process x that satisfies the sde dx db dl kldt 1 where k 0 is a constant and l is the local time of x at zero this process behaves as a brownian motion away from the origin but has a drift proportional to its local time at zero note that such a process is not markovian because its drift depends on the past history see figure 1 for sample path comparisons between reflected brownian motion and bmid bmid can be constructed path by path from a standard brownian motion via the employment of a skorohod map this is discussed in more detail in section 2 we consider continuous time processes xn vn on 2 nn r such that fork 0 i vn t k 2 n leb 0 s t xn s 0 is the scaled time xn spends at the origin ii xn is a jump process with positive jump intensity 22 n 2 nvn t and downward jump intensity 22 n modified appropriately so xn does not transition below zero the existence of such a process and its rigorous definition is presented in section 3 intuitively xn is a random walker on the lattice 2 nn whose transition rates depend linearly on the amount of time the walker spends at zero in other words the positive jump rate of xn increases each time xn reaches zero we show that as the lattice size shrinks to zero i e as n xn vn converges in distribution to x v where x is bmid and v kl is its velocity see theorem 4 4 and corollary 4 5 for pre cise statements by setting k 0 we recover the classical result that random walk on the nonnegative lattice converges to reflected brownian motion 1 1 outline in section 2 we introduce bmid and its construction using skorohod maps we also give an equiva lent formulation of the process x v in section 3 we introduce the necessary background on jump 1 imsart bj ver 2020 08 06 file discreteapprox 2 tex date february 18 2021 ar x iv 1 80 9 04 42 8 v 3 m at h p r 1 7 f eb 2 02 1 http www bernoulli society

reflected brownian motion and a path of bmid each coming from the same brownian sample path this drift of bmid becomes evident as its domination over reflected brownian motion grows with time the drift of bmid comes from its contact with zero which in this figure occurs in the beginning of the process process with stochastic intensity and introduce the setting used by burdzy and white in 6 section 4 contains the statement and proof of the main results theorem 4 4 and corollary 4 5 we conclude by briefly discussing bmid in a multidimensional setting in section 5 1 2 background the study of bmid began in 2001 when knight 11 described a brownian particle reflecting above a particle with newtonian dynamics this two particle system of knight is equivalent in some sense to bmid in that the gap between the brownian particle and the newtonian particle is bmid see section 2 for more background on bmid see 13 where white constructs a multidimensional analog to bmid 3 where bass burdzy chen and hairer study the stationary distribution 1 where barnes describes the hydrodynamic behavior of systems of brownian motions with inert drift burdzy and white studied similar processes from a discrete state point of view 6 they consider a pair of processes x l with state space l rd where l is a finite set and where the transition rate of x depends on l the scaled time x has spent on previous states see subsection 3 2 for defini tions the authors find necessary and sufficient conditions for such a process x l to have stationary distribution where is uniform on space and is gaussian burdzy and white make many conjectures involving approximating bmid and its variants and suggest the results of bass burdzy chen and hairer 3 concerning a multidimensional analog of bmid stem from a discrete approxi mation scheme where the continuous process of bmid is a limit of these processes whose values take place in discretized space the main result of this article confirms the discrete approximation scheme converges to the continuous model in the one dimensional setting bmid is just one example where a process with memory has a gaussian stationary distribution gauthier 8 studies diffusions whose drift is also dependent on the process history through a linear combination of sine and cosine functions he shows the average displacement across time obtains a imsart bj ver

burdzy and gauthier use this discrete approximation scheme taking limits of markov processes in the same class considered here to demonstrate billiards with certain markovian reflection laws have as the stationary measure for space and velocity where as above is the uniform stationary measure in the spatial component and the gaussian stationary measure in the velocity component in section 5 we briefly discuss a multidimensional analog of bmid that inspired conjectures of burdzy and white 2 an equivalent formulation of bmid in this section we describe the process x y v where x is brownian motion reflecting from the inert particle y and where y has velocity v we begin with a probability space p ft t 0 with the filtration ft t 0 satisfying the usual conditions supporting a brownian motion b theorem 2 1 existence and uniqueness knight 11 white 13 choose k 0 and v r there exists a unique strong solution of continuous ft adapted processes x y v satisfying x t b t l t for all t 0 almost surely x t y t for all t 0 almost surely dy v t dt v kl t dt for all t 0 almost surely l is nondecreasing and is flat away from the set s x s y s 2 remark 2 2 flatness of l off s x s y s means 0 1 x s 6 y s dl s 0 one can use the ito tanaka formula to show that l is the local time of x y at zero see 13 th 2 7 that is l t lim 0 1 2 t 0 1 x s y s ds where the right hand side is the local time of x y at zero bmid together with its velocity is equivalent in a certain sense to the process x y v whose existence is given in theorem 2 1 we will refer to the following result by skorohod lemma 2 3 skorohod see 10 let f c 0 t r with f 0 0 there is a unique continuous nondecreasing function mf t such that xf t f t mf t 0 mf 0 0 mf t is flat off s xf s 0 that is given by mf t sup 0 s t f s 0 remark 2 4 the classical l vy s theorem states that for a brownian motion b xb is distributed as b see 10 section 3 6 c imsart bj ver 2020 08 06 file discreteapprox 2 tex date february 18 2021 4 clayton barnes to see the equivalence between bmid and the process x y v from theorem 2 1 consider the gap processg t x t y t obviouslyg 0 almost surely and from 2 it follows that when v 0 dg db dl kldt 3 where l is continuous nondecreasing and flat off u 1 0 from the comment in remark 2 2 on local time g is a reflected diffusion whose drift is proportional to its local time at zero consequently the gap process g is bmid as it satisfies 1 assume we have a pair of processes u v adapted to a continuous filtration ft that supports a brownian motion b and that for fixed k 0 v r u t b t t 0 v x dx v t v kmu t mu t sup 0 s t u s 0 4 in the system 4 it is clear from the definition of mu that u mu 0 and it follows from the skorohod lemma 2 3 that mu is flat off the set s u s mu s 0 therefore b t mu t 0 v s ds and mu is flat off of s b t mu t 0 v s ds consequently b t mu t t 0 v s ds v t satisfies the original equation 2 with respect to the filtration ft similarly one can use the uniqueness statement in skorohod s lemma to go from a solution of 4 to a solution of 2 this demonstrates the equivalence of the two systems 2 and 4 in the sense that if one solution exists for a given probability space p ft where ft supports a given brownian motion then the other solution can be given by a path by path transformation existence of a solution to 2 was first shown by knight in 11 a strong solution to a more general process was attained via the employment of a skorohod map by david white 13 in a more general version of theorem 2 5 given below theorem 2 5 white 13 for every f c 0

18 2021 approximating brownian motion with inert drift by jump processes 5 remark 2 6 in remark 2 4 it is mentioned that replacing the function f with a brownian motion in the formulation of skorohod s lemma 2 3 gives rise to a representation of reflected brownian motion similarly when replacing f in theorem 2 5 pathwise by brownian motion the corresponding process x i v is a solution to 4 note that skorohod s lemma 2 3 implies that m t in theorem 2 5 is the unique monotonically increasing continuous function which is flat off of the level set s x s m s 0 such that x m is nonnegative remark 2 7 one can also see from the above arguments that u v of 4 solves du t db t dl t v t dt dv t kl t dt v 0 v where l is the local time of u at zero 3 markov processes with memory the title of this section seems contradictory because markov processes lose their memory when con ditioning on their current location the processes considered are pairs of processes one process taking values in space and the other process storing the history of the space valued process the transi tion rate of the space valued process depends on this stored history we let c denote the class of such processes which we introduce more formally in this section we will later construct a sequence of pro cesses in c that will approximate bmid first we review well known facts of poisson processes and point process with stochastic intensity for reference see br maud s description of a doubly stochastic point process in 5 chapter 2 3 1 non homogeneous poisson processes a non homogeneous poisson process with a nonnegative locally integrable rate or intensity function t is a process n such that i n 0 0 a s ii n has independent increments iii n is rcll a s iv n a b n b n a d poisson b a s if we let t inf t n

poisson process then t 1 stochastically dominates t 2 in 5 chapter ii br maud discusses the notion of point processes adapted to a filtration ft whose intensity s is not a deterministic function but rather a process adapted to ft with certain conditions definition 3 2 5 ii let nt be a point process adapted to the filtration ft and let t be a nonneg ative ft progressive process such that t 0 s ds

we say nt has stochastic intensity t remark 3 3 in the proofs of later results we will refer to point processes with a given intensity or jump step size by a point process of jump step size a 0 and stochastic intensity we mean a process ant where nt is a point process with stochastic intensity by the positive resp negative jump process for a process we mean the process ant resp ant for example a process with jump size 2 n with positive jump rate 1 t and negative jump rate 2 t is 2 n n 1 n 2 where ni is a point process with stochastic rate i some well known facts of poisson processes have analogous results for poisson processes with stochas tic intensities which we list below lemma 3 4 let n 1 n 2 be two independent point processes with stochastic intensities 1 2 adapted to filtrations f 1 f 2 respectively then n 1 n 2 is a point process with stochastic intensity 1 2 adapted to ft f 1 t f 2 t sketch the fact that n 1 n 2 are independent implies the two processes do not have common jumps so that n 1 n 2 is a multivariate point process the result follows from 5 t 15 chapter ii 2 lemma 3 5 let n 1 be a point process with stochastic intensity 1 t almost surely for some r then we can enlarge the probability space to support a poisson point processn 2 with constant intensity and a point process n 3 of stochastic intensity 3 1 such that n 3 is independent of n 2 and n 2 n 3 has stochastic intensity 1 remark 3 6 it is clear that one can generate a poisson point process n 2 with constant intensity which is independent of n 1 lemma 3 5 could be generalized to include more general lower bounds than a constant however we don t require this and sketch the proof only in the case when n 2 has constant intensity sketch enlarge the probability space to support two independent processes n 2 n 3 where n 2 is a poisson point process of rate and n 3 is a point process with stochastic rate 3 1 by lemma 3 4 n 1 d n 2 n 3 and the processes are adapted to the filtration generated

whose drift depends on the local time of the diffusion at zero intuitively to approximate this diffusion with a markov process on the lattice 2 nn one would want the velocity to depend on the accumulated time spent at zero this is modeled as a jump process whose intensity function is stochastic and depends linearly on the accumulated time the process spends at zero these jump processes need to converge as n to a process whose drift is the appropriate local time imsart bj ver 2020 08 06 file discreteapprox 2 tex date february 18 2021 8 clayton barnes in section 2 we introduced an equivalent formulation for bmid given by u v in 4 in this sub section we will describe two equivalent discrete processes that mirror the equivalence of the continuous processes described earlier see proposition 4 3 we do this because in order to prove the convergence result described in the introduction we actually prove the convergence result for the equivalent formu lation jump processes whose intensity depends linearly on the accumulated time at zero are described by the class c in subsection 3 2 consider a process xn v xn on the state space 2 nn r where vj 0 for all j 6 0 v 0 k 2 n as given in the notation in that subsection we may hide the dependence on n for convenience for an initial velocity v r we define v xn t v k 2 nln t v k 2 n leb 0 s t xn s 0 the rate functions aij r r are ai i sign l 2 n l 2 2 n 2 n l 22 n 2 n v xn t ai i sign l 2 n l 2 2 n 13 where l v xn t except when i 0 where we do not allow a downward transition by lemma 3 4 the jump process xn can be decomposed into a sum of independent processes sn and zn whose rate functions sum to that of xn the following definition will be used throughout the paper definition 4 1 for a process q t we define mq t as the signed running minimum below zero of q that is mq t sup 0 s t q s 0 definition 4 2 consider the processes sn zn vn on 2 nz 2 r where i sn is a continuous time simple random walk on 2 nz with

equivalent formulation of bmid given by u v in 4 to un vn given above existence of sn zn vn follows from the fact that it is of class c or equivalently one can construct the processes via the dynamics given in 8 by using the intensity functions 13 proposition 4 3 the processes un mn vn and xn v xn have the same law imsart bj ver 2020 08 06 file discreteapprox 2 tex date february 18 2021 approximating brownian motion with inert drift by jump processes 9 proof with these definitions un mn vn has the same law as xn v xn because it is of class c and satisfies 13 to see this note that vn

assume the probability space included a process z n with downward stochastic jump intensity v 2 n and step size 2 n such that z n t z n s zn t zn s for all 0 s t t almost surely this inequality holds because the negative transitions of z will have a rate less than v 2 n which is the transition rate for negative jumps of z n and by definition z n makes negative jumps only the jump times of z n are independent of sn hence the processes are independent this demonstrates 15 it follows that un sn zn sn z n u n almost surely notice both processes un mn u n m n transition as a continuous time nonnegative random walk but with an additional drift process of zn z n respectively for instance a transition of un beginning from its running minimum corresponds to a transition from zero for the

skorohod topology remark 4 23 as topological spaces d 0 t rd with the skorohod topology is not equivalent to d 0 t r d with the product topology however because the marginals are c tight this a non issue essentially because uniform convergence to a continuous function becomes the same in both spaces see the comment in jacod and shiryaev 9 vi 1 21 proof note that sn is c tight by donsker s

s z v can be assumed to con verge almost surely in the product metric d d d the product metric ond 0 t r 3 byc tightness of the marginals s z v are all continuous so that s z v is a continuous process as in remark 4 6 this implies the subsequence of sn zn vn converges to s z v almost surely in the uni form norm which implies almost sure convergence in d 0 t r 3 under the skorohod metric thus sn zn vn is c tight as a collection of processes with paths in d 0 t r 3 4 5 lemma 4 8 characterization of subsequential limits we prove items i iv in lemma 4 8 separately the proof of iii was inspired by

almost surely to a process m in the uniform norm one expects ln to converge to m as well proof of iii by tightness and without loss of generality assume lnk l and unk u almost surely in the uniform
