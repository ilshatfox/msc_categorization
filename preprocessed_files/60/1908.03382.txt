theorem 2 9 in section 2 5 below shows the existence of unique solutions of certain sfpes in an abstract setting as an application of theorem 2 9 we establish in theorem 3 8 the existence of unique solutions of sfpes associated with semilinear kolmogorov pdes with lipschitz continuous nonlinearities even in the case where the associated semilinear kolmogorov pde does not possess a classical solution see for example hairer et al 9 to illustrate theorem 3 8 in more detail we provide in the following result theorem 1 1 below a special case of theorem 3 8 theorem 1 1 let d m p n l t p p 0 8

semilinear kolmogorov pdes and arise for example in models from the environmental sciences as well as in pricing problems from financial engineering cf for example burgard kjaer 2 cr pey et al 3 duffie et 2 al 4 and henry labord re 10 sfpes such as 2 are also important for full history recursive multilevel picard approximation mlp methods which were recently introduced in 5 11 see also 1 6 12 13 in 11 12 it has been shown that functions which satisfy sfpes related to semilinear kolmogorov pdes can be approximated by mlp schemes without the curse of dimensionality theorem 1 1 above establishes existence of unique solutions of sfpes related to semilinear kolmogorov pdes with lipschitz continuous nonlinearities within the class of at most polynomially growing continuous functions theorem 1 1 is an immediate consequence of corollary 3 10 in section 3 4 below corollary 3 10 in turn follows from corollary 3 9 which itself is a special case of theorem 3 8 theorem 3 8 is an application of theorem 2 9 the main result of this article theorem 3 8 shows the existence of unique solutions of sfpes associated with suitable semilinear kolmogorov pdes with lipschitz continuous nonlinearities within a certain class of continuous functions related existence and uniqueness results can be found e g in pazy 18 theorem 6 1 2 segal 20 theorem 1 weissler 22 theorem 1 and hutzenthaler et al 11 corollary 3 11 the remainder of this article is organized as follows in section 2 we investigate sfpes in an abstract setting in theorem 2 9 in section 2 5 the main result of this article we obtain under suitable assumptions an abstract existence and uniqueness result for solutions of sfpes its proof is based on banach s fixed point theorem in sections 2 1 2 3 we establish the well definedness of the mapping to which banach s fixed point theorem is applied in the proof of theorem 2 9 in section 2 4 we prove a lipschitz estimate which establishes the contractivity property of the mapping to which banach s fixed point theorem is applied in the proof of theorem 2 9 in section 3 we apply the abstract theory from theorem 2 9 in section 2 in the context of certain stochastic differential equations sdes to obtain theorem 3 8 the main result of section 3 in sections 3 1 3 3 we present several auxiliary results on certain sdes in order to demonstrate that the hypotheses of theorem 2 9 are satisfied in the setting of theorem 3 8 the article is concluded by means of two simple corollaries of theorem 3 8 see corollary 3 9 and corollary 3 10 in section 3 4 below 2 abstract stochastic fixed point equations sfpes in this section we study sfpes from an abstract point of view this section s main result is theorem 2 9 below it is an application of banach s fixed point theorem to a suitable function corollary 2 7 in section 2 3 establishes the well definedness of this function corollary 2 7 is a direct consequence of lemma 2 6 which we establish through an approximation argument building upon lemmas 2 2 and 2 5 the contractivity property of the function to which we apply banach s fixed point theorem in the proof theorem 2 9 is established in lemma 2

continuity properties for solutions of sfpes in this section we establish in lemma 2 2 lemma 2 3 and corollary 2 4 several elementary con vergence and approximation results the convergence result in lemma 2 2 and the approximation result in corollary 2 4 pave the way for section 2 3 they will together with lemma 2 5 be em ployed in the proof of lemma 2 6 in section 2 3 lemma 2 6 in turn has corollary 2 7 as a rather direct consequence which itself is one of the cornerstones of the proof of theorem 2 9 lemma 2 2 let d p n t p p 0 8 q let rd r 0 8 q be a norm on rd let o rd be a non empty

holds that un rd is an open set which satisfies un o and it holds that on un urysohn s lemma cf for example rudin 19 lemma 2 12 hence ensures for every n p n that there exists n p cpr 0 t s o rq which

next let hn r 0 t s o r n p n satisfy for all n p n t p r 0 t s x p o that hnpt xq gnpt xqv pt xq hence we obtain that for all n p n it holds that hn p cpr 0 t s o rq and lim sup k 8 sup tpr 0 t s sup
