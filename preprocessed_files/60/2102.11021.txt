levels 1 introduction the coronavirus has an enormous impact on our health system and today s society as a whole on march 11 2020 the world health organization has officially characterized covid 19 as a pandemic by the end of january 2021 the number of people diagnosed worldwide with covid 19 crossed the 100 million mark 29 which has put a tremendous strain on scarce hospital capacities specifically the pandemic places a load on clinical bed capacity and in particular on intensive care units icu s that is well beyond the currently available bed capacities 4 5 the catastrophic situation in lombardy italy mid march 2020 has tragically shown the impact of the lack of health capacities 24 and the need to manage hospital bed capacities as good as possible in 22 the authors call upon icu practitioners hospital administrators governments and policy makers to be prepared early for a substantial increase in critical care capacity their recommendations relate to among others icu capacity and icu staffing more specifically they recommend to make plans for an increase in capacity as a result of a rapid increase in critically ill covid 19 patients the aim of this paper is to present a prediction model to support plans related to adjusting clinical bed capacities in the netherlands there is a national plan in place for 1 ar x iv 2 10 2 11 02 1 v 1 st at a p 1 5 f eb 2 02 1 upscaling the number of icu beds for covid 19 patients moreover to balance the pressure on clinical and icu beds over the netherlands patients may be relocated to dif ferent regions the lcps landelijk coo rdinatiecentrum patie nten spreiding is the dutch center responsible for these relocations in both situations regions and local hospitals need a couple of days to modify the number of available covid 19 beds and thus require occupancy predictions of a couple of days ahead the prediction model that we implemented consists of two steps first we predict arrivals on the basis of historical data for this we employ a linear programming model that is inspired by smoothing splines that incorporates weekly seasonality and requires little data the prediction has interpretations in terms of the day to day reproduction factor these arrival predictions together with information about the length of stay los distribution is used in the second step to predict hospital occupancy this second step uses methods stemming from queueing theory specifically from discrete time infinite server queues in this paper we use publicly available data to make predictions at the national level the same model was and is used to make predictions at the regional level at the lcps the amount of literature on short term predictions in the order of days of bed oc cupancy levels is limited recently 10 used an ensemble of two forecasting methods for a short term forecast of occupied covid 19 beds in italy furthermore 31 applied epi demic models for short term icu occupancy forecasts in switzerland 19 uses a similar approach for the situation in france the authors of 20 focus on a collection of coun tries and provide predictive analytic tools for excess demand in the supply chain due to covid 19 we refer to 12 for an overview of the transmission dynamics of the covid 19 pandemic the studies above focus directly on the number of occupied beds we think that queueing based insight is essential to understand the relation between arrivals and occupancy which the studies above are lacking the study of 18 provides such a queueing theoretic foundation they explicitly focus on bed demand due to covid 19 and use queueing models to present scenarios for the occupancy based on different arrival patterns of patients that are based on different measures taken however the paper does not involve short term predictions for a more extensive exposition of these types of queues in health care we refer the reader to 28 there are also some papers focusing on short term occupancy forecasts that is not directly related to covid 19 in 13 the authors use a hybrid approach of neural networks and arima models to predict hospital occupancy directly the studies 3 14 mainly focus on hourly seasonality and 16 uses a predictive occupancy database in which the data of each patient is registered the focus of 7 21 is on distinguishing patient groups see also 7 for additional references we note that our approach differs from the methods used in the papers mentioned above the organization of the paper is as follows the method for predicting the arrivals is discussed in section 2 the los distribution can be found in section 3 which is used to in the model to predict the bed occupancy in section 4 the prediction results can be found in section 5 whereas section 6 concludes with a brief discussion on delayed care 2 2 admissions there are different possibilities for building a model for admissions an obvious option is a statistical model that uses historical values to make predictions a disadvantage of such a model is that trend changes cannot be predicted also many classical statistical models require a substantial number of observations in order to produce reliable predic tions whereas data is typically scarce when a new pandemic arises furthermore one would assume that somehow data on positive tests could be used and that presumably positive tests occur before admissions such that data on tests can be used to predict later admissions in figure 1 data on admissions and positive tests at the day of registration are plotted data comes from different publicly available sources in this case nice and rivm as is conveniently gathered at 30 the solid lines are smoothing splines on the logs of the values the red bars indicate policy changes partial lockdowns it took 13 and 11 days for the numbers of admissions to go down the black bars surprisingly the number of positive tests spikes at the same days as the number of admissions for this reason the number of newly registered positive tests per day cannot be used to predict trend changes in admissions another reason are the substantial changes in test policy and behavior the green bar corresponds to one of many changes in test behavior from that day dec 1 on civilians without symptoms could also get a test we see that this led to a sharp increase in number of positive tests hospital admission also increased but at a lower pace other variables than number of positive tests were tried as well on their ability to predict admissions but they were neither useful for these reasons we focused on predicting admissions without external variables a statistical model for predicting daily admissions should have the following properties 1 it should be smooth but at the same time allow for trend changes 2 it should have non negative predictions and exponential growth or decline 3 it should model the intra week seasonality present in the data for these reason we chose inspired by smoothing splines a model with the following features 1 an additive model on the logs because of the multiplicative effect of time and the intra week seasonality 2 that minimizes a weighted sum of errors and second differences to have a smooth trend 3 that uses absolute values to reduce the impact of outliers and few trend changes hopefully representing the policy changes a similar model is used in 15 to forecast demand in hospitality as the model is inspired by smoothing splines it requires little data which is preferable at the start of a pandemic in mathematical terms let at be the realization either of the admissions at the 3 figure 1 admissions and our fits and predictions positive tests and their smoothing spline icu or the clinics our statistical models minimizes the sum of errors and trend changes thus it is actually a minimization problem the decision variables are sd and xt the day factors and the weekly factors respectively let w t be the weekday of day t thus sw t is the day factor of day t also define xt xt xt 1 and 2 xt xt xt 1 and let t be the last day with data our minimization problem is min x s t t 1 xt sw t log at t t 3 2 xt 1 here 0 is a parameter that determines the smoothness of the prediction the smooth ing parameter the first term in 1 gives the difference between the smoothed curve and the data and the second term introduces a penalty for trend changes the fit is given by exp xt sw t t t whereas the t day ahead prediction is a t t exp xt t xt xt 1 sw t t it is interesting to note that rt e xt xt 1 is the fractional de seasonalized increase or decrease it can be interpreted as a day to day reproduction factor epidemiologists define the reproduction factor rt as the amount of people that get infected on average by one infected person at time t as the incubation time is around four days there should be relation between rt and r 4 t in figure 2 r 4 5 t is compared to rt as it is determined by the dutch national institute for public health and the environment rivm we see a similar shape and that the biggest correlation is for a lag of around twelve days which corresponds roughly to the time between infection and hospital admission 4 figure 2 reproduction factors over time 3 length of stay to determine the length of stay los we use data of nice again specifically on their website nice presents data describing the frequencies of number of days that patients spend at the icu and the clinic define s as a random variable denoting the number of hospitalized days taking values in 0 1 that is s may be interpreted as the number of overnight stays at the icu or the clinic some recent studies 1 26 have described the los at two time scales the los in hours depends on many operational factors whereas the los in days is attributed to medical factors our focus is on the latter i e the time resolution in days currently there are still covid 19 patients present at the icu and at the clinic yielding right censoring of the data clearly the number of patients present is also non negligible compared to the total number of covid 19 patients which in particular holds for the icu therefore to estimate the los distribution we use the kaplan meier estima tor in particular we have p s 0 1 and for t 1 2 p s t t s 1 1 ds ns where ds is the number of patients that are discharged after s days and ns is the number of patients that have a los of at least s days either discharged or still present the mean and standard deviation of the los can be found in table 1 we see that the average los at the icu increases with over a day by taking the right censoring into 5 icu clinic patients mean stdev patients mean stdev patients discharged or died 6 984 15 35 12 81 37 274 8 01 6 96 patients currently treated 627 17 25 13 62 1 323 11 98 12 92 kaplan meier estimate 16 64 13 69 8 43 7 51 table 1 los based on public nice data account the impact is smaller at the clinic as a smaller fraction of the patients is still present 8 2 at the icu vs 3 4 at the clinic it is natural to consider the los at the time scale of minutes or hours and model the los as a continuous random variable there is also a considerable body of literature devoted to fitting probability distributions to such a continuous los specifically let x represent a los taking values in 0 recall that s is a random variable denoting the number of hospitalized days taking values in 0 1 when fitting a distribution to the los we will use a fit to the continuous los x and use a continuity correction to find the distribution of s in particular we have for t 1 2 p s t p s t 1 p x t 0 5 in 1 a lognormal distribution is found to fit the los data well the authors also pose the challenge to explain why lognormal distributions seem to fit service durations so well other common distributions for lengths of stay or survival functions are gamma and weibull distributions 17 mixtures of exponentials may also be appropriate we refer to 27 for a study of the los of covid 19 patients in the uk based on a weibull distribution in line with the los distribution of covid 19 patients worldwide 23 we fit lognormal gamma and weibull distributions in figures 8 and 9 these distributions are displayed together with the data adjusted by the kaplan meier estimate for both the icu and the clinic the gamma and weibull distributions can hardly be distinguished interestingly for the icu the gamma and weibull distributions provide visually excellent fits whereas for the clinic the lognormal distribution provides very good fits remark 1 there are different ways to determine parameters of our parametric distri bution x from the perspective of medical specialist and decision makers the method of moments is especially appealing as the first two moment are relatively easy to interpret for instance the impact of changes in the los distribution are straightforward to incorporate for x lognormal 2 we obtain ln x 2 x 2 s 2 and 2 ln 1 s 2 x 2 with x and s 2 denoting the sample mean and the sample variance for x gamma we obtain the shape parameter x 2 s 2 and rate parameter x s 2 for weibull distributions there are no closed form expressions when using the method of moments 6 4 occupancy to predict the occupancy we use principles from queueing theory to describe the evolution of the number of covid 19 patients essentially we model the number of patients as a discretized infinite server queueing model with a time dependent arrival pattern for the special case of continuous time dependent poisson arrivals the mt g has well been analyzed with tractable results 2 8 9 18 uses such an mt g model to quantify how flattening the curve affects peak demand for hospital beds the application of infinite server models also in discrete time is also discussed in 28 as our goal is to predict the demand for beds without capacity constraints the infinite server assumption is appropriate albeit we use a discrete time version when predicting future occupancy we need to distinguish two groups of patients i patients that are currently present and ii patients that will arrive in the future for the patients that will arrive in the future we need a prediction of admissions as described in section 2 and the subsequent length of stay as described in section 3 for the first group observe that the patients that are currently present the total length of stay differs from the one in section 3 whereas part of the length of stay has elapsed since we predict on publicly available data we cannot use the elapsed length of stay of each individual patient a reasonable alternative seems to use the stationary residual length of stay for which p sr t k t p s k es which follows directly from renewal theory a disadvantage of the stationary residual length of stay is that the arrival process is obviously not stationary therefore we propose an alternative that takes the past arrival pattern into account next we derive the residual length of stay sr of a tagged patient present at time t note that the probability that this patient arrived at day t u is proportional to at up s u for u 1 t hence the probability that this tagged patient arrived at day t u is at up s u t k 1 at kp s k the probability that the residual length of stay of the tagged patient is at least s when the patient arrived at day t u equals p s s u s u p s s u p s u combining the above we have p sr t t u 1 at up s u t k 1 at kp s k p s t u p s u t u 1 at up s t u t k 1 at kp s k observe that this is consistent with the stationary residual length of stay by taking a constant and letting t now we turn to predicting the occupancy as the allocation of covid 19 patients is based on the occupancy in the morning we focus on nt the number of occupied beds at the beginning of day t we then have the following relation nt t nt i 0 1 sri t t 1 s 0 at s i 1 1 si t s 7 where sri is the residual los of the ith patient present and si represents the los of the ith patient arriving on that specific day the first term is due to patients that are currently present at time t whereas the second term are patients arriving in the future observe that with the relation above it is possible to derive the distribution of nt t focusing on the expectation it holds that n t t ent t ntp sr t t 1 s 0 eat sp s t s providing the t day ahead prediction n t t at day t moreover using the same relation above and assuming that at s and at u are independent for s 6 u the variance is varnt t ntp sr t 1 p sr t t 1 s 0 varat s g t s 2 eat s g t s 1 g t s where g t s p s t s note that the expression above simplifies if the arrivals follow a poisson process with a known parameter in that case varat s eat s and varnt t will converge to ent t such that nt t will behave as a poisson random variable for t large enough 5 predictions in this section we present the numerical results that follow from our prediction model as we only have reliable occupancy data of covid 19 patients from mid october 2020 we will use the time period from november 1 2020 until february 1 2021 as an illustration this also involves an interesting period due to the remarkable behavior of infections and hospital admissions during the second wave in line with the operations at the lcps we use predictions of 3 and 7 days ahead to assess the accuracy of the predictions we use the following three evaluation measures weighted absolute percentage error wape mean absolute error mae and root mean squared error rmse we note that the wape is also referred to as the weighted mape for a period of n days these measures are defined as wape n t 1 yt y t n t 1 yt mae 1 n n t 1 yt y t rmse 1 n n t 1 yt y t 2 where yt and y t are the actual and predicted values respectively at day t first in the arrival predictions 1 there is a tunable smoothing parameter figure 3 shows the impact of the smoothing parameter on the wape and mae for both the icu arrivals red lines and occupied icu beds 3 day ahead predictions for the icu beds we use both the complete prediction model blue lines and the occupancy model fed by the 8 figure 3 impact of the smoothing parameter on accuracy of arrival and occupancy 3 day ahead predictions at the icu actual arrival stream green lines the aim of the latter is to obtain insight in the impact of the los on the accuracy of the occupancy forecast as there is no error in the arrival prediction in that case this also implies that the green lines are not affected by as this parameter only affects the arrival prediction the differences between the green and blue lines should be interpreted as the error in occupancy prediction that is due to the unknown arrival process also observe that the arrivals red and occupancy blue are at a completely different level as will also become apparent below explaining the differences in absolute mae and relative wape errors clearly for very small the forecast is too responsive whereas the opposite occurs for large we note that the behavior is similar for 7 day ahead predictions and for the clinic in practice it is desirable to tune the parameter based on contextual information such as measures taken as this may improve the prediction 25 for consistency we use a single smoothing parameter of 10 in the experiments below next we visualize the predictions for 1 7 days ahead for the arrivals and occupancy of both the icu and the clinic in figure 4 we present the predictions made at december 22 2020 the arrivals are plotted on the left with the solid lines the actual values the blue dotted lines the fit and the red dotted lines the predictions the occupancies are plotted on the right with the solid lines the actual values again the red dotted lines the predicted values and the blue dotted lines the predictions when the arrivals are known the aim of the latter is to obtain insight in the impact of inaccurate predictions for the arrival process for the arrivals we see a very good fit blue line with an apparent weekly arrival pattern in particular for the clinic the arrival predictions for the clinic are accurate but for the icu the model seems to overestimate the number of arrivals specifically the increasing trend does not continue as strongly as suggested by the data up to dec 22 this also leads to an overestimation of the number of occupied icu beds compare the red line 9 figure 4 predictions of arrivals left and occupancies right for the icu top and clinic bottom at december 22 2020 10 figure 5 3 day ahead predictions of arrivals left and occupancies right for the icu top and clinic bottom with the blue line for the icu beds regarding the occupancy for the clinic there seems an overestimation of the number of occupied beds for the period from dec 24 until dec 28 this is not due to the arrival predictions as the red and blue lines are rather similar it seems likely that some patients might be discharged earlier from the clinic in the period around christmas to see how the predictions behave over time we use a rolling horizon and for every day make predictions for 3 and 7 days ahead in figure 5 the 3 day ahead predictions with corresponding bandwidth together with their realizations are shown for the arrivals and occupancies for the icu and the clinic overall the predictions are visually accurate we see that the predictions tend to deviate from the realizations at moments when the arrival pattern changes i e when the arrivals reach a local peak or valley when the number of arrivals is at such a local peak or valley it takes a couple of days for the arrival prediction to detect that the local trend is changing and this change is not caused by some random realizations when the predictions are completely based on the time series without further contextual information it seems difficult to overcome such an issue however the prediction model is able to adapt to such trend changes after a couple of days similar 7 day ahead predictions are shown in figure 6 we see similar phenomena for 11 figure 6 7 day ahead predictions of arrivals left and occupancies right for the icu top and clinic bottom 12 3 days ahead 7 days ahead wape mae rmse wape mae rmse arrivals ic 26 9 19 11 27 34 12 10 14 90 arrivals clinic 15 34 24 47 28 24 52 02 68 55 beds ic realized arrivals 2 9 72 12 67 2 13 24 17 18 beds ic forecasted arrivals 3 20 02 25 58

predictions the 7 days ahead predictions as for the 3 days ahead predictions however the bandwidth is wider and it naturally takes more time to detect a trend change for the 7 days ahead predictions than for 3 days ahead in table 2 the accuracy measures of the predictions are presented again for the arrivals and occupancies and the icu and the clinic clearly the relative errors wape are largest for the admissions which is partly explained by the fact that the number of arrivals is considerably smaller than the number of occupied beds see also remark 2 for the impact of scale moreover it reveals that predicting arrivals is complicated for such a volatile process including changes in trend the 3 day ahead prediction in the required number of icu beds is remarkably accurate given the inherent randomness in the bed census process see remark 2 a wape of 3 seems to be the best achievable for the 7 day ahead prediction of icu occupancy we see that the error is mainly determined by the error in the arrival process 9 with forecasted arrivals vs 2 with actual arrivals overall the model performs very well for the most important predictions i e the icu occupancies compared to the icu the predictions for the clinic occupancies seem not as good as expected in particular even with the actual arrival streams the wape is still 6 and 7 for 3 and 7 days ahead respectively these errors can be explained by the discharge behavior at the clinic where there are only few discharges during the weekend which are compensated during the week we like to emphasize that the discharge behavior during the week only has a modest impact on the prediction results in our current practice as the predictions are only used for at specific days during the week finally we consider the impact of the number of days ahead on the accuracy mae and wape of the icu predictions in figure 7 the red line concerns the arrivals whereas the blue line is the prediction of the occupancy the green line is the occupancy in case the actual arrivals are used and deviations are due to the los as the scale differs between arrivals and occupancy the mae is considerably smaller and the wape considerably larger for the arrivals compared to the occupancy of course the predictions become less accurate when the forecast is longer ahead if the actual number of arrivals are known we see that the occupancy predictions green line remain quite accurate even for 14 days ahead hence prediction of the arrival process is crucial in particular for predictions that are more than a week ahead 13 figure 7 accuracy of icu predictions for 1 14 days ahead remark 2 the assessment of the accuracy of predictions is complicated by the inherent randomness in arrivals and los for instance suppose that our aim is to predict the value of a poisson random variable with rate the poisson distribution typically reflects the randomness in arrivals or occupancy the most accurate prediction would be y t in that case with n and using 6 we have mae 2 b c 1 e b c wape mae and rmse for example for equal to 50 500 and 2000 the mae is 5 6 17 8 and 35 7 respectively whereas the wape is 11 3 3 6 and 1 8 respectively 6 conclusion and discussion in this paper we presented a mathematical model to give short term predictions in the order of days of the number of occupied icu and clinical beds due to covid 19 the model first predicts the arrivals and then employs a queueing based method to convert arrivals into occupancy the predictions for the icu occupancies are accurate in particular for 3 days ahead for the clinical occupancies there is a seasonal component in discharges with considerably less discharges during the weekend that affects the performance of the predictions averaged over all days an interesting topic for further research is to take the seasonal component in discharges into account as well predictions of a couple of days ahead are crucial to properly manage icu and clinical bed capacity and to relocate patients across the country in essence the framework is also suitable for longer term scenarios but an appropriate approximation of the behavior of the arrival process is then crucial moreover covid 19 admissions consume a considerable part of the resources at the ics and clinics in the netherlands additional resources were also used such as post anesthesia recovery beds and anesthesiologists who worked as buddies next to the intensivists this also reduced other forms of hospital capacity 14 together leading to reduced capacity for other forms of care leading to waiting lists for multiple forms of care it is hard to quantify the impact of the delays for example 11 reports up to 50000 healthy years of life lost due to the first wave based on 28 of the specialist medical care however some of this loss can be recovered if extra treatments are provided in the future there is no centralized information on the length of waiting lists and the rate at which lives are lost from a mathematical view it is interesting to study the impact of the second wave on the delayed care for the moment the daily admissions have not reached the peak level of the first wave but the rise and decline of the second wave has been much slower leading to a higher number of patients and days of hospitalization this inevitably leads to more delayed care it is highly likely that waiting lists will become at least twice as long this has a quadratic impact on the years of life lost if twice as many patients wait on average twice as long before treatment the total impact is 4 times higher this amplifies the need for an efficient use of resources and good predictions of required capacity acknowledgments part of the work has been carried out during the period that we were affiliated with the lcps we would like to thank marcel de jong and the lcps for providing us insight in the management of covid 19 in the netherlands and the pleasant and fruitful cooperation a length of stay distributions in figures 8 and 9 the length of stay distribution is displayed for the icu and the clinic respectively for both cases the data is plotted after applying the
