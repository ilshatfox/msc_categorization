abstract in this study we propose a new method that is useful for estimating unknown parameter values of stochastic differential equation sde models based on probability density function pdf data measured from random dynamical systems as our method does not require explicit description of pdf it can be applied to the sde models even when their pdfs are hardly derived in explicit forms due to multiplicative noise terms nonlinear terms and so on therefore our method is expected to provide a versatile tool to dynamically parameterize measured pdf data in our proposed method it is assumed that a measured pdf is obtained from a random dynamical system whose structure is described by a known sde model with unknown parameter values with the help of it calculus the fokker planck equation fpe is derived from the sde model the measured pdf and a candidate of parameter values are substituted into the fpe to calculate a fpe residual our method is applied to two random vibration systems their fpe residuals tend to zero as the parameter values tend to exact values showing that our proposed fpe residual can be utilized for unknown parameter estimation of sde models key words parameter

accurate modeling of random dynamical systems is an old and new issue in the fields of physics hatjispyros et al 2007 engineering poulimenos and fassois 2006 yoshida et al 2019 economics bhattacharya and majumdar 2003 and so on in this study we propose a new method that estimates unknown parameter values of sde models based on measured pdf data of random dynamical systems as shown in fig 1 our proposed method assumes that a measured pdf is obtained from a random dynamical system whose structure is described by a known sde model with unknown parameter values the sde model is transformed into the corresponding fpe with the help of it calculus the measured pdf and a candidate of parameter values are substituted into the fpe to calculate a fpe residual the resulting fpe residual is expected to tend to zero as the parameter values tend to exact values our continuous time domain approach clearly differs from other typical previous methods using discrete time models and or frequency domain techniques hatjispyros et al 2007 poulimenos and fassois 2006 moreover our method has the advantage that it does not require explicit description of pdf it can be applied to the sde models whose pdfs are hardly derived in explicit forms due to multiplicative noise terms nonlinear terms and so on in this study our proposed method is tested on two linear random vibration systems the resulting fpe residuals tend to zero as the parameter values tend to exact values meaning that our proposed method is capable of estimating unknown parameters of sde models the rest of the paper is organized as

dynamical system described by a stratonovich sde as 0 0 1 where is time is the random state vector is an dimensional vector valued function is an matrix valued function is an dimensional standard brownian motion and is a dimensional parameter vector in this study we impose the following assumptions on our problem the system is stable the system functions and are structurally known the value of the parameter vector is unknown a stationary pdf data of the state is obtained for a certain our problem is to estimate that makes the sde 1 reproduce the measured shape in the sense of least squares 3 method of parameter estimation 3 1 fitting measure based on fpe residual although the stratonovich sde 1 provides a proper stochastic description of classical mechanics with random fluctuations it is incompatible with it calculus gardiner 2004 that we use in this study to make it compatible with it calculus we transform 1 to the it sde 0 0 2 which is mathematically equivalent to 1 through 1 2 1 1 1 3 hereafter and denote th and th components of vector and matrix respectively according to it calculus gardiner 2004 the pdf of the solution of 2 satisfies the following fpe fpe 0 0 0 1 0 4 where is the dimensional dirac s delta function and 1 5 is the divergence of the vector field of called a probability current whose components are given by 1 2 1 1 6 letting be the exact solution of 4 and be an estimated solution we propose a pdf fitness as d fpe 2 7 where d is an appropriate state space domain and fpe is a fpe residual obviously 0 for furthermore in this study we expect the following asymptotic property 0 8 based on the above we can solve the optimization problem arg min 9 2 2020 the japan society of mechanical engineers where is substituted by the measured pdf data in the following sections in addition since this study assumes that the system is time invariant and stable the fep has a stationary solution i e this yields 0 and simplifies the fpe residual to the stationary version fpe 10 in the following sections we use the stationary 10 to solve the optimization problem 9 and estimate unknown with the stationary pdf data 3 2 numerical implementation we consider a time series of the state vector of length measured from the random dynamical system 1 as 0 0 1 11 where is a sampling interval a sufficiently large initial time 0 is taken to obtain a

random linear vibration systems in this final section we demonstrate capability of our proposed method described in section 3 4 1 random linear vibration system with additive noise to provide reliable tests on our method we start with a linear vibration system whose pdf is explicitly known specifically we consider a linear vibration system with an additive noise only given by a 23 where is a damping is a stiffness a is a noise strength and is a standard gaussian white noise using a state vector denotes transpose and a parameter vector a we rewrite 23 to the sde from with 0 1 0 a scalar 24 we obtained a sample of time series of length 107 by numerically solving 23 from 0 0 0 for 1 0 5 1 with time step 0 01 to obtain a stationary data the same length of initial response was skipped to store for numerical integration a fourth order runge kutta gill method was used with the white noise term simulated by 0 1 where is normal pseudo random numbers and 1 is the numerical factor required for integrating stochastic differential equations higham 2012 from this stationary the pdf data was numerically generated as shown in fig 2 by means of the procedure described in section 3 2 2 on the 1 2 domain d 4 4 4 4 with the bin number 50 4 1 1 estimation of independent parameters fig 3 plots the value of our proposed pdf fitness on parameter plane with a 3 1 fixed the square root value is plotted for ease of viewing on the plane 0 the small cross mark indicates the exact parameter value and the curves indicate contours of obviously our proposed forms a smooth and unimodal concave shape and its minimal point appears to be close to the exact this implies that our optimization problem in 21 can be solved by gradient methods in this way the unknown parameter values were estimated as 0 99980749 0 49415439 with 4 529 10 4 their estimation errors were 0 019 1 169 of the exact 1 0 5 therefore the results show that our proposed method achieved a reasonable degree of accuracy of the unknown parameter estimation 4 2020 the japan society of mechanical engineers 0 6 0 8 1 0 1 2 1 4 c 0 30 4 0 50 60 7 0 8 e 0 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 1 2 fig 4 pdf fitness value plotted on a parameter

extraction of parameter dependency our method can also be applied to extracting parameter dependency as the system 23 is linear and additive gaussian its stationary pdf becomes gaussian and can be explicitly derived as risken 1989 a 2 exp a 2 21 2 2 25 such a gaussian distribution is determined by only the following statistics 1 2 0 1 a 2 2 2 a 2 2 1 2 0 26 where and denote mean and variance of respectively and denotes covariance between and in these statistics only the variances depend on the system parameters and they have a common factor a 2 2 in other words the shape of the pdf 25 is parameterized by a under the constraint a 2 2 2 particularly in this example since the pdf data was built for 1 0 5 1 our pdf fitness must vanish along the level set a 2 2 2 12 2 0 5 1 fig 4 shows the corresponding value on a parameter plane with 1 1 fixed the abovementioned level set a 2 2 or a 2 2 1 appears as the bottom of the ravine shape of in fig 5 the small circles indicate our estimated value for given and a values where is fixed to the exact 1 1 and a is taken at 25 uniform grid points within the range 0 a 1 the solid curve indicates the exact level set a 2 2 in these results the maximal estimation error of was less than 2 81 of the exact value in this way our proposed method also achieved a reasonable degree of accuracy of extracting unknown parameter dependency 4 2 random linear vibration system with both additive and multiplicative noises the second example is of the system whose pdf is not explicitly known this is simply given by a linear vibration system subjected to both additive and multiplicative noises as follows 0 1 0 0 a 1 a 2 1 1 2 27 where 1 and 2 are independent standard brownian motions and a 1 and a 2 are the corresponding noise strengths this system is linear but its explicit pdf is not yet known gitterman 2005 nakao 1998 zorzano et al 1999 using the same procedure and conditions as those in the first example we generated the pdf data of 27 for a 1 a 2 1 0 5 1 0 6 then we applied our method to estimating a 1 a 2 values with 1 2 fixed the resulting estimation was a 1 a 2 1 00762436 0 58836647 with the pdf fitness 7 267 10 4 and thus their estimation errors were 0 762 1 939 of the exact a 1 a 2 1 0 6 the results show that our method yielded a reasonable degree of accuracy even when the explicit pdf formulation is not available given the above it is clearly demonstrated that our proposed method has an advantage of not requiring any explicit pdf expression to estimate parameters although this advantage will become distinguished in nonlinear problems we have restricted ourselves in this study to linear problems to demonstrate primal examples of our method 5 2020 the japan society of mechanical engineers 5 conclusion in this study we developed a new method that estimates the unknown parameter values of sde models from pdf data without any explicit pdf formulation for this purpose we used fpe residuals and developed a pdf fitness measure that tend to zero as the parameter values tend to exact values using the proposed measure we estimated unknown parameter values of linear random vibration systems and obtained the following results as for a random linear vibration system with an additive noise only the independent parameters i e the damping and stiffness were estimated with estimation errors of under 1 7 the relationship between the dependent parameters i e the damping and noise strength were extracted with estimation errors of under 2 9 as for a random linear vibration system with both additive and multiplicative noises the independent parameters i e the additive and multiplicative noise strengths were estimated with estimation errors of under 2 0 the above results lead to the conclusion that our method achieved sufficient practical accuracy of the unknown parameter estimation even when the explicit pdf formulation is not available in future work we plan to apply our method to nonlinear problems for which the advantage of our method will become distinguished acknowledgment we would like to thank prof hiroya nakao for suggesting the topic treated in this paper this work was funded by
