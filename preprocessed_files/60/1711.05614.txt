azarbaijan shahid madani university department of electrical engineering tabriz iran 1 f samadi azaruniv ac ir 2 j salehi azaruniv ac ir abstract the supply of electrical energy is being increasingly sourced from renewable generation resources the variability and uncertainty of renewable generation compared to a dispatchable plant is a significant dissimilarity of concern to the traditionally reliable and robust distribution systems in order to reach the optimal operation of community microgrids mgs including various distributed energy resource der the stochastic nature of renewable generation should be considered in the decision making process to this end this paper proposes a stochastic scenario based model for optimal dynamic energy management of mgs with the goal of cost and emission minimization as well as reliability maximization in the proposed model the uncertainties of load consumption and also the available output power of wind and photovoltaic units are modeled by a scenario based stochastic programming through this method the inherent stochastic nature of the proposed problem is released and the problem is decomposed into a deterministic problem finally an

power systems comprising distributed energy resources ders and electricity end users possibly with controllable elastic loads all deployed across a limited geographic area 1 depending on their origin ders can come either from distributed generation dg or from energy etorage systems ess dg refers to small scale power generators such as diesel generators fuel cells and renewable energy sources res as in wind or photovoltaic pv generation since mgs can participate in power markets and also provide some ancillary services proper scheduling of the mg is essential from the main grid point of view 2 6 therefore a suitable strategy should be pursued for the mg operation in recent years many researchers have gravitated to optimization based fields 8 10 locating global optima in many real world optimization problems is often painstakingly tedious thus finding a better optimization algorithm is a critical task the self adaptive evolutionary programming method is implemented for solving the nonlinear optimal power flow problem in 8 the bacterial foraging algorithm is used for the optimal control of a dg system in 9 and 10 mailto f samadi azaruniv ac ir mailto j salehi azaruniv ac ir an

the variability of res single period chance constrained economic dispatch problems for res have been studied in 11 yielding probabilistic guarantees that the load will be served considering the uncertainties of demand profiles and pv generation a stochastic program is formulated to minimize the overall cost of electricity and natural gas for a building in 12 without dsm robust scheduling problems with penalty based costs for uncertain supply and demand have been investigated in 13 recent works explore energy scheduling with dsm and res using only centralized algorithms 14 15 an energy source control for optimal operation of mg is formulated and solved using model predictive control in 16 the probabilistic methods can be classified into three categories the monte carlo simulation mcs the analytical techniques and the approximate methods the mcs methods are the most straightforward and accurate one but have the shortcoming of remarkable computational efforts analytical techniques need fewer number of simulations but still require complicated mathematical computation approximate methods provide balance among computational efficiency and accuracy the 2 m point estimate method pem as approximate method is an efficient and reliable method to model the uncertainty in power systems we focus on selecting a strong and robust evolutionary algorithm in order to solve the proposed complex operational scheduling of mgs that is located on the top of the dispatching priority one of the new evolutionary algorithms that has great potential is a cuckoo optimization algorithm coa also this paper implements the stochastic scenario based approach to model the uncertainty in hourly load demand and available output power of solar and wind dg units the rest of this paper is structured as follows section ii shows the stochastic scenario based model in section iii the modelling of load and renewable generation are shown the proposed problem is formulated in section iv and section v explains the utilized algorithm results and conclusions are drawn in section vi and vii respectively ii stochastic analysis approach random sampling is a corner stone of the stochastic scenario based method hence using a most efficient method for scenario generation is crucial load uncertainty roots from the characteristics of the load that can be affected by many different variables such as weather temperature humidity special programs followed by the governments etc here we assume that a prediction tool is available for hour by hour sequence of load forecasts since the load forecasts are generally inaccurate the forecast error is modelled as zero mean normally distributed random variable note that the normality assumption of the demand forecast error is standard in the literature 17 in this regard firstly the probability density function pdf is performed by the use of data samples of previous several years then depending on the desired accuracy the pdf is divided into different levels the area related to each level represents the probability of such forecast error level wind energy as one the most important kinds of the renewable energy sources has played a significant role in the growth of the renewable resources owing to its characteristics of the environmental compatibility and also the economical fuel costs it has experienced fast development in the recent years however as the random variation of the wind speed the output power generated by the wt is neither continuous nor stable and therefore cannot be supposed as a reliable power source 17 the basic idea to model these variations in the evaluations is the probabilistic methods iii system model a modeling of dg units the model describing each dg is described as follows a

pch t 1 dis pdis t 7 b load demand model the electric load is an uncertain parameter in deregulated environment such as mgs but this parameter is specifically tied with various factors an increase decrease in electric load will tend to increase decrease in electricity price and vice versa without loss of generality the correlation between wind speed and load price pattern are assumed to be independent which can be modeled as a normal distribution function by mean value and standard deviation as an efficient scenario based stochastic model for dynamic operational scheduling of community

function of the ded problem is to minimize the total production cost over the operating horizon by minimizing f 1 the total energy and operating cost of the mg includes the fuel costs of units operation costs emission cost as well as power losses costs the utilized objective function simultaneously minimizes fuel cost and operating costs the optimal values obtained by minimizing f 1 provide

all types of emissions considered such as nox sox thermal emission etc in the present study two important types of emission gases are taken into account the amount of nox and sox emission is given as a function of generator output that is the sum of a quadratic and exponential function as follows e pg i ipgi i pgi 2 i exp ipgi 12 ne i 1 d power losses cost hourly power losses considering network

mainly one year this cost is calculated as the amount of unsupplied energy multiplied by the forfeit as 16 where ens specifies the amount of unsupplied energy kwh at stage t and aens signifies the value of forfeit kwh for the unsupplied energy at t indicates set of hours at one day it is clear that f 2 indicates the daily cost in day then the average energy not supply or loss of load

considered since the objective function of this paper equation 16 comprises several terms and all terms are given in day therefore the reliability cost should also be given in day as a result ens kwh multiplied by the value of forfeit kwh is equal to the reliability cost ens cost in h or day in case of applying the other reliability indexes that their units are not day the problem has to be reformulate as a multi objective problem that allows different units for instances many electric distribution company use saifi or saidi because of end users in such case the problem is reformulated

by controllable dg units v solution algorithm cuckoo optimization algorithm is a meta heuristic algorithm developed by rajabioun in 2011 20 the basic idea of this algorithm is based on the obligate brood parasitic behavior of some cuckoo species in combination with the levy flight behavior of some birds and fruit flies cuckoos are fascinating birds not only because of the beautiful sounds they can make but also because of their aggressive reproduction strategy some species such as the ani and guira cuckoos lay their eggs in communal nests though they may remove others eggs to increase the hatching probability of their own eggs quite a number of species engage the obligate brood parasitism by laying their eggs in the nests of other host birds some host birds can engage direct conflict with the intruding cuckoos if a host bird discovers the eggs are not its own it will either throw these alien eggs away or simply abandon its nest and build a new nest elsewhere each cuckoo starts laying eggs randomly in some other host birds nests within her elr fig 3 gives a clear view of this concept 21 fig 3 random egg laying in egg laying radius elr vi results and discussions the pg e 69 bus distribution network with three kinds of dgs units and esss is utilized for implementing the proposed stochastic scenario based model for optimal daily operation of mgs details about the pg e 69 bus test system can be found in reference 22 in this paper a typical low voltage lv mg portrayed in figs 4 is considered as the test system the mg consists of different der units such as the chp pv wt and also nimh battery based ess the system data is adopted from ref 23 it is supposed that all dg units produce active power at unity power factor neither requesting nor producing reactive power furthermore there is a power exchange link between the mentioned mg and the utility lv network in order to trade energy during a day based on decisions of the microgrid central controller mgcc table i offers the technical specifications of the utilized der units including pv and wt in the mentioned mg as shown table i although the pv and wt units don t use any fuel their price is much higher than the other units this fact is because of their high capital cost the price of these units considers high to assign payback cost for the initial outlay or as maintenance and renewal costs the hourly forecasted load demand inner the mg the normalized forecasted output power of wt and pv for a typical day are shown in fig 5 furthermore there is a power exchange link between the utility and the mg during the time step in the study period based on the decisions made by the mgcc it is assumed that the mgcc purchases the maximum available power of the wt and pv at each hour of the day moreover in order to make the analysis simpler it is supposed that all the units work in electricity mode and no heat load demand is needed it should be pointed out that all evolutionary methods require tuning of different algorithm parameters for their proper searching a small change in these parameters may result in a large change in the algorithm performance coa overcomes such difficulties because it does not require any parameter for tuning it means this algorithm reaches the optimal solution without adjusting any parameter an efficient scenario based stochastic model for dynamic operational

00 pm 12 00 pm the average value of generated power of utilized der units consists of pv wt chp and ess units are shown in fig 5 for 24 hours from the point of mg operation the stochastic approach by consideration of the intermittent nature of system components and loads can provide a more accurate solution for determining the allowance and optimum costs and emissions the stochastic single objective mgs operation is solved by usage of the scenario generation scheme described in previous section 2 1000 24 h scenarios 22 are generated and subsequently trimmed to six batches the number of scenarios is usually selected in a way that the coefficient of variation becomes small i e between 0 1 and 1 23 the voltage profile based on mean values has been shown in fig 6 according to this figure with using the proposed method for daily energy management of mg voltage profile of system is improved fig 7 shows the power losses and ens for proposed method and traditional energy management for smart distribution network according to this figure it is observed that by applying the proposed method for energy management the power losses of system are decreased based on correlation between network input and output variables the output of the network parameters shows probabilistic behavior it should be noted that the main disadvantage of the batches with enormous scenarios is the great

65 58 63 49 fig 7 power losses and ens of mg based on expected value in this paper the stochastic approach tries to find expected optimal solutions for operation of mgs the stochastic solutions may not be global optima solutions to the individual scenarios but they are a robust and also located near global solutions which this provides possible realizations of the uncertainties in the optimization process each scenario considers different values for load wt and pv powers output and market price also each scenario has different decision variables but the same state variables the expected operation costs and emissions of these 30 scenarios are the output random variables which should be optimized simultaneously in the algorithm procedure the power loss and ens cost of mg can be shown in pdf form in fig 8 fig 9 illustrate the optimal charging discharging of ess units during operation horizon it can be seen that in the off peak times the ess units charge and then in peak hours discharge into the network therefore by optimal arbitrage of ess units can be achived more profit for fig 8 pdfs of power losses and ens value fig 9 plot box of ess over entire operation times mg operatore and it leads to more reduction in ens value in peak periods also it can be inferred from the results that modeling of the system uncertainties will increase the operation cost and emission values because stochastic procedure considers different most probable scenarios instead of one scenario as the deterministic scheme indeed approaching to the real conditions of the power system in the ante scheduling studies will cost some expenses which are expectable in other words stochastic dynamic operation will concurrently consider the most probable scenarios besides using the proposed stochastic framework all 30 accepted scenarios according to their probability values contribute into the output random variable results whereas the deterministic method relies on only one scenario the 30 accepted scenarios capture more of the uncertainty spectrum of the power system which is an efficient scenario based stochastic model for dynamic operational scheduling of community microgrids 32 nd power system conference 2017 tehran iran 7 approximately four times more than that of the deterministic framework so the results of the stochastic framework are more realistic than the deterministic framework results vii conclusion in this paper coa based method has been developed and applied to solve the dynamic operational scheduling of mgs with clean sources such as wt pv and ess units for economic reliable and emission operation problem by considering uncertainties including wt and pv powers output and load demand over the 24 h study horizon also for getting closer to real condition as well as the reliability reasons a reserve constraint is taken into account the best advantage of the proposed algorithm is quick transfer of the information between agents which this gives more ability to the proposed algorithm in finding the global optima irrespective of the complexity of the problem besides an innovative parameter setting technique is complemented to the original coa to cope with the drawback of premature convergence this modification includes two powerful knowledge interaction strategies each individual according to a probability model chooses one of these methods to improve its knowledge since some ress such as wt pv have intermittent characteristic approaches to analyze mgs would be stochastic rather than deterministic the proposed approach shows how the proposed formulation works in comparison with an unreal case based deterministic technique to take the uncertainties into account a stochastic scenario based method according to the monte carlo technique is implemented using the proposed model possible scenarios of power system operating states are generated and a probability is assigned to each scenario for a tradeoff between computation time and accuracy a backward scenario reduction technique is utilized there are three possible avenues for future work arising from this paper namely 1 considering other uncertainty modeling approaches such as igdt pem and roa 2 taking into account anther mgs management options like capacitor switching and network reconfiguration 3 integrating of phev parking lots in mgs as backup source to cope with operating uncertainties and 4 using multi objective optimization to create a tradeoff between various objectives references 1 department of energy office of electricity
