captive jump processes andrea macrina levent a mengu tu rk murat c mengu tu rk department of mathematics university college london london united kingdom center for financial engineering ozyegin university istanbul turkey november 16 2021 abstract we explicitly construct so called captive jump processes these are stochastic processes in continuous time whose dynamics are confined by a time inhomogeneous bounded domain the drift and volatility of the captive processes depend on the domain s boundaries which in turn restricts the state space of the process we show how an insurmountable shell may contain the captive jump process while the process may jump within the restricted domain in a further development we also show how within a confined domain inner time dependent corridors can be introduced which a captive jump process may leave only if the jumps reach far enough while nonetheless being unable to ever penetrate the outer confining shell captive jump pro cesses generalize the recently developed captive diffusion processes in the case where a captive jump diffusion is a continuous martingale or a pure jump process the uppermost confining boundary is non decreasing and the lowermost confining boundary is non increasing captive jump processes could be considered to model phenomena such as electrons transitioning from one orbit valence shell to another and quantum tunneling where stochastic wave functions can penetrate boundaries i e walls of potential energy we provide concrete worked out examples and simulations of the dynamics of captive jump processes in a geometry with circular boundaries for demonstration keywords captive processes jump diffusion in continuous time martingales monitoring and path dependence bounded domains quantum systems msc 2020 60 1 introduction in this work we develop captive jump processes which may include jump diffusion pure jump pro cesses and path dependent processes with jumps all of which have a confined path space these stochastic processes generalize the recently introduced captive diffusion processes by mengu tu rk mengu tu rk 2020 along with several potential applications thereof see mengu tu rk mengu tu rk 2021 a for an example in quadratic optimization and mengu tu rk mengu tu rk 2021 b to model random particle systems in many physical and social systems one encounters random processes that are restricted in their dynamics where the stochastic phenomenon stays within a given topological subspace we emphasize a macrina ucl ac uk l menguturk ucl ac uk murat menguturk ozyegin edu tr 1 ar x iv 2 11 1 07 13 5 v 1 m at h p r 1 3 n ov 2 02 1 several examples such as skorokhod type stochastic differential equations sdes 3 4 6 16 diffusion processes on submanifolds 1 2 13 reflected diffusions 9 11

share is that they all have continuous paths however there are many observed systems which display discontinuities at random times possibly due to shocks producing substantial impact on the evolution of the system here we mention transitions of quantum systems across excitation levels e g electrons jumping to a different energy level sudden price reactions to news in financial markets and so on thus studying processes manifesting pure jump or jump diffusion dynamics attracts a great deal of interest in numerous applications and modelling purposes if not for their sake captive jump processes by construction cannot leave a given bounded domain we call the master domain within this domain these processes may have either pure jump continuous or jump continuous dynamics in fact such a process may display all of these dynamics over non overlapping time intervals to construct captive jump processes we rely on the approach developed in 23 and thus generalize it at the same time pure jump and jump diffusion processes are controlled by coefficients of stochastic differential equations sde which satisfy certain regularity conditions with respect to a pair of ca dla g paths acting as the boundaries one may further sub divide the bounded domain into subspaces e g internal corridors as in 25 and require by construction that the process stay within one of these restricting subspaces at the same time however we can allow for non zero probabilities that the processes may jump from one subspace to another while still staying constricted within the master domain almost surely the structure of this paper is as follows section 2 introduces captive jump diffusion processes and studies some of their properties in section 3 we apply the framework to the physical phenomena as mentioned above along with some simulations for demonstration purposes 2 construction and properties of captive jump processes we consider a filtered probability space f ft t p f f where all filtrations are right continuous and complete we denote the borel field by b and introduce the time interval t 0 t with some fixed horizon t we let d r be the skorokhod space of ca dla g functions where x d r r produces a ca dla g process xt t t by fxt t t we denote the natural filtration of xt t t such that fxt ft for any t t we start next with the construction of markovian captive jump processes after which we gener alize to a path dependent setting 2 1 capitve jump diffusion processes the space of continuous r valued ft p markov martingales e g brownian motion is denoted m r c r where c r d r is the space of continuous functions we denote j r d r as the space of discontinuous functions so that any element jt t t of j r is a markov jump process with finite activity and jump size equal to one that is if jt t t is a stochastic process its randomness arises only from its jump times e g the poisson process we write jt jt jt for t t for all t t so if jt 0 then the process jt is continuous at t if jt 6 0 then this implies there is a discontinuity at t the following function space will model the boundaries that define the restricted domains definition 2 1 let g d r be a set of measurable ca dla g functions where for any g g g t r is a locally bounded map with a locally bounded right derivative dg t dt on the intervals where g t is continuous we also introduce the following subspaces 2 1 g g is the space of purely continuous boundaries 2 g l g is such that g g l implies g t 0 for all t t 3 g u g is such that g g u implies g t 0 for all t t we now introduce a family of processes that extends 23 and forms the main focus of this paper thereafter we study their main properties and provide some examples below definition 2 2 let gl g l and gu g u such that gl t gu t for all t t then a captive jump diffusion process xt t t d r is the solution to an sde governed by xt x 0 t 0 s xs g l s gu s ds t 0 s xs g l s gu s dms 0 s t s xs gl s gu s js 1 where x 0 x 0 gl 0 gu 0 the maps t r r and t r r are locally bounded and continuous and t r r is locally bounded and ca dla g they satisfy 1 t gl t gl t gu t dgl t dt gl t and t gu t gl t gu t dgu t dt gu t 2 t gl t gl t gu t 0 and t gu t gl t gu t 0 3 gl t xt t xt gl t gu t gu t xt for all t t p a s assuming that mt t t m r and jt t t j r are mutually independent to maintain a flexible level of generality we define captive jump diffusion processes as solutions governed by eq 1 without imposing specific conditions on the coefficients of the sde for existence and uniqueness in order to get a unique strong solution one can further require the coefficients satisfy lipschitz continuity and linear growth proposition 2 3 for any t t gl t xt gu t holds p almost surely proof the continuous case is recovered if t xt g l t gu t 0 for all t t which is proven in 23 we have xt 6 0 only when jt 1 where the magnitude of xt is conditionally restricted for all t t by property 3 in definition 2 2 jumps can at most take xt t t onto a boundary where the conditions on and ensure reflection or absorption p a s given that jt t t has finite activity hence gl t xt gu t for all t t p almost surely the reason why we call these processes captive stems from proposition 2 3 the process cannot break free from the restricted domain proposition 2 4 let x c t t t and x d t t t be such that 1 x c t t t is a captive continuous process with paths in g l c t g u c t t t almost surely 2 x d t t t is a captive pure jump process and thus discontinuous with paths in g l d t g u d t t t almost surely then xt t t given by x c t x d t is a captive jump diffusion process with path in g l c t g u c t t t a s given that x c 0 x d 0 glc 0 guc 0 glc t gld t and g u d t g u c t for all t t 3 proof if 0 then xt t t is a captive continuous process see 23 and if 0 then xt t t is a captive pure jump process the statement follows from the linear construction in definition 2 2 and by using proposition 2 3 remark 2 5 since neither mt t t nor jt t t are necessarily markovian in general captive jump diffusion processes are not necessarily markov processes the term diffusion in this paper is to highlight continuity of paths and not markovianity when xt t t is markovian we replace mt t t in 1 with an ft p brownian motion wt t t for a canonical representation and choose for jt t t an independent markov jump process example 2 6 as a trigonometric example we first show that st t t given by st sin wt is a captive diffusion process between l c t t t 1 and u c t t t 1 this follows since st 1 2 t 0 sin wu du t 0 cos wu dwu 1 2 t 0 sin sin 1 su du t 0 cos sin 1 su dwu 1 2 t 0 su du 1 s 2 s dwu where t st 1 1 12 st satisfies property 1 and t st 1 1 1 s 2 t satisfies property 2 of definition 2 2 respectively at 1 1 for all t t next we can consider a captive pure jump process zt t t between l d t t t 0 and u d t t t 1 as follows zt 0 s t s 1 z 2 s js where t 0 1 for all t t hence using proposition 2 4 the following sde provides a captive jump diffusion process within 1 1 with positive jumps xt 1 2 t 0 xs ds t 0 1 x 2 s dws 0 s t s 1 x 2 s js one can replace st t t above with st cos wt which is also a captive diffusion process we can generalise the continuous part given in example 2 6 for a subclass of bounded functions as such the result below together with proposition 2 4 provides an alternative way to construct different captive jump diffusion processes proposition 2 7 let f r a b be a bounded continuous function such that for x f y 1 f has continuous inverse i e y f 1 x 2 f has bounded continuous first derivative i e g y f y with g f 1 a g f 1 b 0 3 f has bounded continuous second derivative i e h y 2 f y 2 where h f 1 a 0 and h f 1 b 0 then xt t t given by xt f wt is a captive diffusion within a b for all t t proof using ito s integration by parts formula and the conditions provided for the map f we have xt x 0 1 2 t 0 h ws ds t 0 g ws dws x 0 1 2 t 0 h f 1 xs ds t 0 g f 1 xs dws 4 since f r a b we have f 0 x 0 a b having h f 1 a 0 and h f 1 b 0 property 1 in definition 2 2 is satisfied since a and b have vanishing right derivatives in addition g f 1 a g f 1 b 0 shows that property 2 is satisfied since the process xt t t is continuous 0 and the statement follows resorting to proposition 2 7 is not the only way to construct captive jump continuous processes in fact this construction only gives rise to a relatively small family of captive jump diffusions we provide an alternative and more involved example below example 2 8 let jt t t be a poisson process the following process is a mean reverting captive jump diffusion with reflective boundaries xt x 0 t 0 s s xs ds t 0 s xs ls us xs dws 0 s t s min xs ls us xs js 2 for x 0 l 0 u 0 where t t t and t t t 0 are adapted continuous locally bounded maps and lt t ut for all t t so that t t lt dl t dt lt and t t ut du t dt ut for all t t also t t t is a ca dla g map where t 1 1 0 for all t t in the figure below we plot sample paths genereted by a simplified version of the sde 2 where we consider constant boundaries lt t t and ut t t and constant t t t figure 1 here lt t t 2 and ut t t 3 and t t t 2 5 since sums of semimartingales are semimartingales if jt t t is a ft p semimartingale then xt t t is a ft p semimartingale given that has locally bounded variation proposition 2 9 let l u g then lt t t must be non increasing and ut t t must be non decreasing if either of the following holds 1 xt t t is a continuous ft p martingale 2 xt t t is a pure jump process proof since l u g we have lt ut 0 for any t t for the first part if xt t t is a continuous ft p martingale then 0 since t lt lt ut 0 dl t dt and t ut lt ut 0 du t dt must hold for all t t it follows that lt t t must be non increasing and ut t t must be non decreasing for the second part if xt t t is a pure jump process 5 then 0 since the jump times of jt t t do not depend neither on lt t t or on ut t t and since cannot act on xt t t over time horizons where jt t t does not jump we have the following p xt ut 0 if du t dt 0 p xt lt 0 if dl t dt 0 for t t however the captivity property is preserved if du t dt 0 and dl t dt 0 since the boundaries cannot block the paths of xt t t even over time horizons where no jumps occur and hence over periods during which xt t t remains constant proposition 2 10 let lt t t and ut t t be constant and ep jt ft 0 for all t t then the boundaries must be absorbing if 1 xt t t is a continuous ft p martingale 2 xt t t is a pure jump ft p martingale proof let inf t 0 xt lt l xt ut u be the first hitting time to either of the boundaries where inf and define yt t t such that yt xt for all t t since lt t t and ut t t are constant we have dl t dt du t dt 0 if xt t t is an ft p martingale then we have ep xt and ep xt fu x 0 u 0 s xs ls us ds u 0 s xs ls us dms 0 s u s xs ls us js ep t u s xs ls us fu ds ep t u s xs ls us dms fu ep u s t s xs ls us js fu xu t u ep s xs ls us fu ds u s t ep s xs ls us js fu xu 3 for all u t t if xt t t is continuous then 0 and 0 must hold and since 0 by definition 2 2 we must have xt t t yt t t if xt t t is a pure jump process then 0 by using the independence of jt t t the following must hold u s t ep s xs ls us js fu u s t ep s xs ls us fu ep js fu 0 since this holds for every u s t t and ep js fu 0 ep s xs ls us fu 0 must hold for every u s t t if t that is the captive process jumped onto a boundary during t and if t is any time strictly after at which jt t t jumps this always holds due to the finite activity property we have ep x l u f 0 ep l l u f 0 if x l ep u l u f 0 if x u 4 for t using property 3 in definition 2 2 we have one of the following cases l l u 0 u l u 0 in any of these two cases eq 4 holds only if x l u 0 for any thus xt t t yt t t must hold 6 we now ask is there a family of transformations under which a captive jump diffusion is mapped to another captive jump diffusion the answer is yes first let c 2 b r c r be the subspace of continuous locally bounded functions that are twice differentiable with continuous locally bounded derivatives from this point onwards xt t t is a markovian captive jump diffusion process as in remark 2 5 we shall recall that the jump times of jt t t are mutually independent of xt t t proposition 2 11 let l u g f c 2 b r and yt f xt for all t t if f is monotonic over the domain of xt t t then yt t t is also a captive jump diffusion process proof first of all since f is monotonic either f lt yt f ut if f is increasing or f ut yt f lt if f is decreasing for all t t p a s we write f lt t and f ut t for t t note that g next we derive the sde for yt t t and check the conditions in definition 2 2 at these boundaries using ito s lemma we have the following yt y 0 t 0 f x dxcs 1 2 t 0 2 f x 2 d xcs x c s 0 s t f xs f xs y 0 t 0 f x s xs ls us 1 2 2 f x 2 2 s xs ls us ds t 0 f x s xs ls us dws 5 0 s t f xs f xs y 0 t 0 s ys s s ds t 0 s ys s s dws 0 s t ys 6 for all t t we can write and in 6 in terms of y and since f is monotonic and thus has an inverse so that we can find some and that can provide 5 also since f c 2 b r and are locally bounded and continuous and due to this continuity yt 6 0 if and only if jt 1 for all t t since the jump times of jt t t are mutually independent of xt t t f does not change the distribution of the jumps times of yt t t it only acts on the jump sizes hence there exists some function where we can write ys s ys s s js therefore we recover 1 yt y 0 t 0 s ys s s ds t 0 s ys s s dws 0 s t s ys s s js for all t t we now need to check whether and satisfy property 1 and 2 in definition 2 2 respectively and whether satisfies property 3 in definition 2 2 at the boundaries we begin with the case where f is increasing then and yt attains its minimum at t when xt lt since f x 0 for any x we have t t t t f l t lt lt ut f l dl t dt d t dt given that we know 2 f l 2 2 s ls ls us 0 since s ls ls us 0 by property 2 in definition 2 2 on the other hand yt attains its maximum at t when xt ut and hence t t t t f u t ut lt ut f u du t dt d t dt therefore satisfies property 1 in definition 2 2 as for it satisfies 2 in definition 2 2 since s s s s f l s ls ls us 0 and s s s s f u s us ls us 0 7 finally t yt t yt t t t yt must hold p a s since we know that t yt t holds and jt 0 1 for all t t p a s the case when f is decreasing follows similarly here and yt attains its minimum at t when xt ut hence having f x 0 for any x t t t t f u t ut lt ut f u du t dt d t dt also since yt attains its maximum at t when xt lt we have the following t t t t f l t lt lt ut f l dl t dt d t dt again satisfies property 1 in definition 2 2 we already know satisfies property 2 in definition 2 2 finally since t yt t for all t t p a s we must have t yt t yt t t t yt for all t t p a s which is property 3 in definition 2 2 example 2 12 let yt e xt for all t t then yt t t is a captive jump diffusion process where elt yt eut for all t t p a s example 2 13 let lt 0 and yt x 1 t for all t t then yt t t is a captive jump diffusion process where u 1 t yt l 1 t for all t t p a s 2 2 path dependent captive jump processes so far the generated jump processes have been restricted to never leave a single confined space in mengu tu rk mengu tu rk 2021 b captive diffusion processes have been introduced which are confined to stay within a finite space for some time in their terminology a tunnel before being allowed to diffuse into another confined space in a following period of time this behaviour makes of a captive diffusion a path dependent process because of the implicit monitoring that is required in order to control the shift of the diffusion from one corridor to another in what follows we show how captive jump processes can be constructed such that for part of the time they stay confined in a bounded space before they are allowed to jump to another restricted area for some time this behaviour requires the modelling of controlled jumps arrival times and size and continuous monitoring of the process which in turn makes the captive jump process path dependent as the simulation in section 3 will illustrate the restricted areas tunnels captive jump processes may jump to are not required to be adjacent in the sense that the process may skip neighbouring corridors such features render captive jump processes flexible and useful in a variety of applications accordingly we go on to develop a way to extend definition 2 2 by allowing internal boundaries to appear in doing so we follow 25 and introduce multiple time segments denoted by t j t for j 0 m n for a fixed m 1 here t j j start j end such that 0 j start j end t for j 0 m we choose t 0 t m t that is 0 start m start 0 and 0 end m end t each of these time segments govern a boundary process g j t t t j where we have g 0 g l g m g u and g j g for any j 6 0 and j 6 m given that m 1 we emphasize that g 0 t t t 0 stands for lt t t and g m t t t m stands for ut t t in the previous section these are the master or outer boundaries we collect all boundaries by gt g 0 t g m t in the situation where there is a g j t for 0 j m that is not defined over some t t then gt does not include such a g j t at the time t t finally for any j k at any t t j t k 6 we require the ordering g j t g k t and for any pair g j t g k t where t j t k their order can be pairwise arbitrary 8 remark 2 14 the master boundaries g 0 and g m define the largest bounded domain on which captive processes may evolve and each g j is called an internal boundary for j 6 0 j 6 m and m 1 next we introduce progressively measurable and increasing processes j t t t j given by j t j start sup s xs 6 0 for j start s t t j for j 0 m where we adopt the convention sup hence if there is no jump in a given time period t j then j t j start for all t in the period t j we also introduce a monitoring process t t t that records the values of xt t t at j t t t j for j 0 m as such we let t t t be the non anticipative and set valued process t x j t j t j t t j 0 m for all t t in the case we require a function to be continuous with respect to the topology we mean is continuity with respect to the elements of the following definition may also be viewed as a lemma to proposition 2 16 below definition 2 15 a piecewise confined captive jump process xt t t c r is the solution to the stochastic differential equation xt x 0 t 0 s s xs gs ds t 0 s s xs gs dms 0 s t s s xs gs js 7 where x 0 x 0 g 0 0 g m 0 here is a locally bounded map that is continuous possibly except at x 6 0 is a locally bounded continuous map and is a locally bounded ca dla g map satisfying 1 t t g j t gt dg j t dt g j t if x j t g j j t for all t t j 2 t t g j t gt dg j t dt g j t if x j t g j j t for all t t j 3 t t g j t gt 0 for all t t j 4 g 0 t xt t t xt gt g m t xt for all t t for j 0 m p a s given that mt t t m r and jt t t j r are mutually independent there are a few observations worth making at this stage first we notice that g j t 0 for any j 6 0 and j 6 m since they belong to g i e internal boundaries cannot have discontinuities this however is no real restriction since multiple internal confining functions g j t t t can be used in sequence to construct a piecewise process that behaves like an internal corridor with jumps the reason for requiring each individual g j g for any j 6 0 and j 6 m is a technical requirement that is needed for proposition 2 16 below to ensure captivity in each corridor segment that would otherwise be broken over time periods where xt t t is continuous second the sde coefficients are path dependent that is they monitor past values of the captive jump process at j t t t j this means that such processes are non markovian even if mt t t and jt t t are markov processes third the initial condition x 0 g 0 0 g m 0 does not include g m 0 since we associated the case x j start g j j start with property 1 above which could have been associated with property 2 having initial condition x 0 g 0 0 g m 0 fourth property 4 only requires the jump coefficient to be bounded with respect to the master boundaries g 0 t g m t hence definition 2 15 allows for jump sizes to exceed internal corridors this will be useful for applications of captive jump processes 9 proposition 2 16 the following statements hold p almost surely 1 for any t t g 0 t xt g m t 2 for any j 6 0 and j 6 m if x j start g j j start then xt g j t if jt 0 for all t t j if jt 1 for some t t j then p xt g j t 0 3 for any j 6 0 and j 6 m if x j start g j j start then xt g j t if jt 0 for all t t j j start if jt 1 for some t t j then p xt g j t 0 proof this follows from our construction of definition 2 15 together with proposition 2 3 and proposition 2 8 in 25 combined with property 4 in definition 2 15 that allows xt for t t to be large enough for xt t t to exceed the boundary g j for j 6 0 and j 6 m but not from the master boundaries g 0 g m p a s proposition 2 16 also tells us that can be chosen in such a way that if xt t t is in an internal corridor then it may remain in that corridor even if there is a jump property 4 of definition 2 15 allows for this feature however we are more interested in modelling systems where a transition between two internal corridors is allowed if there is a jump and only if there is a jump as definition 2 15 offers 3 applications we shall work with mean reverting captive jump processes see example 2 8 for demonstration we refer the reader to 23 for other families of captive processes with no jumps which can be extended by use of definition 2 2 3 1 confinement within circular domains we first consider a setup without internal corridors let x 1 t t t be a captive jump diffusion where x 0 0 a d for some 0 a d and let x 2 t t t be another captive jump diffusion where x 0 0 0 2 these two processes are governed by dx i t i x i t dt x i t l i u i x i t dw i t i t min x i t l i u i x i t j i t here w 1 t t t and w 2 t t t may be correlated similarly j 1 t t t and j 2 t t t may also be correlated the process t t t may be any ca dla g map as long as t 1 1 0 for all t t for the examples below we simulate in advance a random path for t t t by uniformly sampling its values at every step on a discrete time grid the boundaries are given by a l 1 1 u 1 d 0 l 2 2 u 2 2 next we construct the two dimesional process pt t t given by x 1 t x 2 t t t on a polar coordinate system where x 1 t t t models the distance from the origin and x 2 t t t is the radian process if r d is the radius of a circle we can choose a and d such that pt t t evolves either inside the outer circular domain or within a circular corridor inside the domain first we show the case where an outer circle serves as the outer boundary for the confined circular domain we can see two different accumulation behaviours in figure 2 on the left hand side we see that the process tends to evolve towards the origin of the circle while on the right hand side the process visits the border of the circle many times during the simulation period 10 figure 2 here a 0 d r 4 and 1 2 a d remark 3 1 one can introduce a third captive jump diffusion process x 3 t t t as the second or thogonal radian coordinate and project x 1 t x 2 t x 3 t t t inside a sphere this indicates how the construction of captive jump processes can be extended to processes taking values in confined domains in rn n n in figure 3 we shrink the domain inside the circle to keep the paths within shrinking rings each shaped as a toroid again this can be extended to three dimensions in the spirit of remark 3 1 figure 3 confining boundaries a d top left 0 3 5 top right 1 3 bottom left 1 5 2 5 bottom right 1 5 2 this setup can be used to model systems with a central gravitational force which keeps stochastic particles within circular corridors here even if x 1 t x 2 t t t jumps it can never cross the master outer boundaries and so break free from the confined toroidal space in the next section we shall add internal corridors which the particles are allowed to trespass only if they jump far enough 11 3 2 captive jumps across circular domains now we consider the situation where in addition to the outer boundaries there are two inner boundaries for the distance process x 1 t t t we keep the radian process x 2 t t t as in the previous section we set t 0 t 1 t 2 t 3 t such that g 0 t t t a g 1 t t t b g 2 t t t c and g 3 t t t d hence j start 0 and j end t for j 1 3 so we simply write j t t for j 1 3 and t t we initialize x 1 t t t such that it starts within the inner circular corridor where x 0 0 a b for some 0 a b c d where a b forms the lowermost corridor b c forms a mid corridor and c d forms the uppermost corridor for x 1 t t t which is now governed by dx 1 t 1 t 1 t x 1 t dt g j g x 1 t g j dw 1 t 1 t min x 1 t a d x 1 t j 1 t here g a b c d and 1 t 1 t t t is given by t t w 1 a 1 w 1 b if x t a b w 2 b 1 w 2 c if x t b c w 3 c 1 w 3 d if x t c d for some w 1 w 2 w 3 0 1 next we construct a process pt t t by introducing the two dimesional process x 1 t x 2 t t t taking values in the polar coordinate system the plots in figure 4 show samples of x 1 t t t and the associated process x 1 t x 2 t t t the simulation on the left hand side shows how x 1 t x 2 t t t in polar coordinates remains within the lower or upper corridors where the transition from a b to c d occurs when x 1 t t t jumps far enough to skip the mid corridor b c on the right hand side x 1 t x 2 t t t visits every corridor depending on the size of the jumps of course the process might jump within a specific corridor without necessarily leaving it the conditional state probabilities can be calculated where in our context state means a corridor that is it is possible to calculate the probability of the captive jump process to move from one corridor to another we express the conditional state probability by pt k l a b p x 1 t k l ft x 1 t a b for k l b c c d we also define the set s k l k x 1 t min x 1 t a d x 1 t l x 1 t min x 1 t a d x 1 t finally we ask for 1 t t t and j 1 t t t to be mutually exclusive then we have the following pt k l a b p t s k l ft x 1 t a b p jt 1 ft x 1 t a b for k l b c c d note that since in this model t 1 1 0 for all t t we have pt k l a b 0 if k x 1 t min x 1 t a d x 1 t this shows that x 1 t t t has a higher probability of moving to another corridor if it is closer to a boundary of that corridor these probabilities can be calculated from any one corridor to another i e we also have pt k l c d p t s k l ft x 1 t c d p jt 1 ft x 1 t c d 12 figure 4 here a 1 b 2 c 2 5 d 3 5 also w 1 w 2 w 3 0 5 for k l a b b c again since t 1 1 0 for all t t we have pt k l c d 0 if l x 1 t min x 1 t a d x 1 t finally the probability of the captive jump process moving from the mid corridor to either the inner or outer corridor is given by pt k l b c p t s k l ft x 1 t b c p jt 1 ft x 1 t b c for k l a b c d hence the set s k l serves for all possible changes of state in this model all expressions can be further simplified if t t t and jt t t are mutually independent such that pt k l x 1 x 2 p t s k l x 1 t x 1 x 2 p jt 1 this setup can be used to model a system in which a stochastic particle may jump from one energy state to another with a large enough jump that is induced by a sufficiently energetic exogenous shock here one might make a connection to a quantum mechanical system whereby one is interested in modelling the transition of the stochastic wave function of a quantum particle from one energy state to another another application that could be considered is the modelling of quantum tunnelling in a stochastic setting here the potential walls barriers of the quantum system that the particle overcomes could be modelled by the boundaries of an internal corridor which are overcome by a large enough jump in this context while the quantum particle is modelled by a captive jump process able to overcome walls a classical particle would be modelled by a captive diffusion process 13 trapped within a possibly time dependent corridor see 25 the concept of domain boundaries or walls which produce clusters unable to disperse if unaided by external intervention abounds in many fields of physics but it is also encountered in finance e g volatility clustering herding in markets
