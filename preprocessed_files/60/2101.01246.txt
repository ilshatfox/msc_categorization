escape proba escape and absorption probabilities for obliquely reflected brownian motion in a quadrant philip a ernst sandro franceschi and dongzhou huang abstract we consider an obliquely reflected brownian motion z with positive drift in a quadrant stopped at time t where t inf t 0 z t 0 0 is the first hitting time of the origin such a process can be defined even in the non standard case where the reflection matrix is not completely s we show that in this case the process has two possible behaviors either it tends to infinity or it hits the corner origin in a finite time given an arbitrary starting point u v in the quadrant we consider the escape resp absorption probabilities p u v t resp p u v t we establish the partial differential equations and the oblique neumann boundary conditions which characterize the escape probability and provide a functional equation satisfied by the laplace transform of the escape probability we then give asymptotics for the absorption probability in the simpler case where the starting point in the quadrant is u 0 we exhibit a remarkable geometric condition on the parameters which characterizes the case where the absorption probability has a product form and is exponential we call this new criterion the dual skew symmetry condition due to its natural connection with the skew symmetry condition for the stationary distribution we then obtain an explicit integral expression for the laplace transform of the escape probability we conclude by presenting exact asymptotics for the escape probability at the origin 1 introduction 1 1 model and goal let z t z 1 t z 2 t be a reflected brownian motion rbm in the quadrant starting from the point u v with positive drift 1 2 that is 1 0 2 0 the covariance matrix is 1 1 with 1 and the reflection matrix is 1 r 2 r 1 1 we further assume that r 1 0 r 2 0 and 1 6 r 1 r 2 1 see figure 1 for a representation of the parameters we define this reflected process up to the first hitting time t of the corner defined as t inf t 0 z t 0 for t 6 t this process may be written as z 1 t u w 1 t 1 t l 1 t r 2 l 2 t z 2 t v w 2 t 2 t r 1 l 1 t l 2 t 2 where l 1 t resp l 2 t is a local time on the vertical resp horizontal axis and is a continuous non decreasing process starting from 0 which increases only when z 1 t 0 resp z 2 t 0 under condition 1 when t t that is after that the process z hits the corner the process is no longer defined by 2 for reasons of convexity in lieu for t t we define z t 0 0 and say that the process is absorbed when t further details on the existence and uniqueness of this process will be given in section 1 2 the objective of the present paper is to study the probability of escape to infinity for a process starting from u v we denote this probability as p u v t the corresponding absorption probability at the origin is p u v t 1 p u v t key words and phrases escape probability absorption probability obliquely reflected brownian motion in a quadrant functional

figure 1 reflection vectors and drift since its introduction in the eighties by harrison reiman varadhan and williams 25 26 44 42 45 reflected brownian motion in the quarter plane has received significant attention from probabilists recurrence and transience of obliquely reflected brownian motion were examined in 29 44 and the process has also been considered in planar domains 22 27 as well as in general dimensions in orthants 26 41 46 the stationary distribution of obliquely reflected brownian motion has been studied in 9 10 21 31 12 and its green s functions have been studied in 18 the roughness of its paths has been studied in 32 obliquely reflected brownian motion has played an important role in applications concerning heavy traffic approximations for open queueing networks 23 39 it has also been utilized in queueing models as diffusion approximations for tandem queues 33 34 37 there are several possible interpretations in insurance risk of models involving reflected le vy processes in a quadrant 1 4 30 for example suppose there are two funds each of whose free surplus is modelled by a crame r lundberg process and which have the following agreement a deficit in one fund is instantly covered by the other fund with ruin occuring when neither company can cover the deficit of the other in the case of our problem the absorption probability could be interpreted to be the probability of ruin the escape probability may be interpreted as the probability of survival and infinite capital expansion the aforementioned process also arises in the study of queueing models as diffusion approximations for some le vy tandem queues 7 17 43 previous works 3 13 16 21 17 have adapted an analytic method initially developed for random walks by fayolle and iasnogorodski 14 and malyshev 36 for studying obliquely reflected brownian motion above all we mention 17 which focus on a non standard regime where the reflected process escapes to infinity along one of the axes the techniques and the results employed to solve this problem are very similar to this article this method is based on the boundary value problem theory documented by the books of fayolle et al 15 and cohen and boxma 8 the present article is in part inspired by this analytic approach 1 2 definition of the process given in 2 brownian motion in a quadrant with oblique reflection is usually defined as a process which behaves as a standard brownian motion in the interior of the quadrant reflects instantaneously on the edges with constant direction and the amount of time spent at the origin has lebesgue measure zero varadhan and williams 42 such a process is defined as a solution of a submartingale problem 42 an interesting case arises when the process is a semimartingale reflecting brownian motion srbm reiman and williams 40 showed that a necessary condition for the process to be an srbm is for the reflection matrix to be completly s 1 taylor and williams 41 showed that this condition was also sufficient for the existence of an srbm which is unique in law due to condition 1 the reflection matrix of the process in 2 is not completely s the process indeed is not a standard srbm as it may be trapped at the origin nonetheless it is 1 a square matrix r is said to be completly s if for each principal sub matrix r there exists x 0 such that r x 0 escape and absorption probabilities for brownian motion in a quadrant 3 possible to define this absorbed process up to the stopping time t the existence and uniqueness as a solution of a submartingale problem for the absorbed process is given in 42 2 1 thm 2 1 further in taylor and williams 41 4 2 and 4 3 the existence and uniqueness of an srbm absorbed at the origin are proven without assuming that the reflection matrix is completely s 1 3 from the quadrant to the wedge franceschi and raschel 21 appendix recently showed that studying reflected brownian motion in a quadrant is equivalent to studying reflected brownian motion in a wedge with angle with identity covariance matrix with two reflection angles and and with drift angle see figure 2 the angles and when the drift is nonzero are in 0 and are defined by tan sin r 2 cos tan sin r 1 cos tan sin 1 2 cos cos 3 the angles are equal to 2 when the denominators of the tangents are equal to 0 figure 2 reflected brownian motion in a wedge of angle reflection angles and and drift angle finally we denote now a standard quantity in the srbm literature to be 4 condition 1 is equivalent to or equivalently 1 and 1 4 the case of zero drift the case of zero drift 0 was treated by varadhan and williams 42 in this case the absorption probability does not depend on the starting point we have from 42 thm 2 2 p t 1 if 0 0 if 6 0 if 6 0 the corner is not reached if 0 2 the corner is reached but the amount of time spent by the process in the corner is lebesgue measure zero if 2 the process reaches the corner and remains there the previous properties are valid in the case of zero drift under condition 1 the case of positive drift poses a new challenge as 0 p u v t 1 remark that condition 1 is equivalent to 1 1 5 escape probability and stationary distribution of the dual process harrison 23 and foddy 16 showed that the hitting time on one of the axes is intrinsically connected to the stationary distribution of a certain dual process as the present article was nearing completion it came to our attention that harrison 24 has extended the results in his earlier work 23 by introducing a dual rbm in the quadrant with drift and reflection matrix r 2 1 1 r 1 when 1 r 1 r 2 this configuration of parameters is depicted in figure 3 below this dual process has an explicit connection with the study of the escape probability in particular harrison 24 cor 2 states that p u v t s u v where is the stationary distribution of the dual process and s u v u r 2 z 1 z 2 v z 1 r 1 z 2 r 2 z 1 z 2 r 2 is a trapezoid as pictured in figure 3 4 philip a ernst sandro franceschi and dongzhou huang figure 3 dual process parameters and trapezoid s u v in brown 1 6 plan the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we explore some general properties of the process of interest given in 2 this section s key result is theorem 10 which states that the process has only two possible behaviors either t which means that the process is absorbed at the origin in finite time or t in which case the process escapes to infinity namely z t when t in section 3 we present proposition 11 which gives a partial differential equation characterizing the escape probability later in this section we give proposition 12 which provides a functional equation satisfied by the laplace transform of the escape probability in section 4 we study the kernel of this functional equation and obtain asymptotic results for the absorption probability in the simpler case where the starting point is u 0 proposition 17 in section 5 we find a geometric condition which characterizes the cases where the absorption probability has a product form and is exponential theorem 20 such a result recalls the famous skew symmetry condition studied a lot for invariant measures 25 28 in section 6 we establish a boundary value problem bvp satisfied by the laplace transform of the escape probability proposition 22 and conclude with theorem 30 which gives an explicit integral formula of this transform in section 7 we obtain exact asymptotics for the escape probability at the origin in memory of larry shepp we dedicate this article in memory of our colleague mentor and friend professor larry shepp professor shepp indelibly contributed to many areas of applied probability and one of the areas that interested him most concerned rbm in a quadrant as well as in a strip 22 27 2 general properties of process z in this section we investigate a few key properties of the process given in 2 we prove three key results the first one is that if the starting point tends to infinity then the probability that the process does not hit the origin tends towards 1 theorem 4 the second one is that when the starting point tends to the origin the probability that the process hits the origin in finite time tends towards 1 theorem 6 the third key result is that the process has only two possible behaviors either t which means that the process is absorbed at the origin in finite time or t in which case the process escapes to infinity namely z t when t theorem 10 2 1 limits of the hitting probability our first key results of the section theorems 4 and 6 concern the probability of the process hitting the origin we wish to show that lim u v p u v t 1 we shall prove this with the aid of lemma 1 and proposi tion 3 for ease of notation let us define 1 inf t z 1 t t and 2 inf t z 2 t t further let x 1 t u w 1 t 1 t and let x 2 t v w 2 t 2 t suppose z t is a one dimensional reflected brownian motion the analysis of z t is con verted to that of one dimensional brownian motion with a drift by the skorokhod map however escape and absorption probabilities for brownian motion in a quadrant 5 in the case of obliquely reflected brownian motion in a quadrant this method does not generally work due to the presence of l 1 t and l 2 t however on the event 1 note that l 1 t 0 the previously reflected brownian motion becomes an obliquely reflected brownian motion in a half plane this allows the one dimensional techniques to be applied in our case this motivates us to consider the event 1 below lemma 1 for u 0 we have p u v 1 p u v x 1 t t r 2 sup 0 s t t x 2 s for every t 0 5 where x equals x if x 0 and is 0 otherwise hence p u v 1 p u v x 1 t r 2 sup 0 s t x 2 s for every t 0 6 a symmetrical result holds for v 0 and p u v 2 proof on the event 1 for every t 0 we have l 1 t 0 p u v a s then z 1 t t x 1 t t r 2 l 2 t t z 2 t t x 2 t t l 2 t t note that l 2 t t increases only when z 2 t t 0 by uniqueness of the skorokhod map see e g 38 and references therein l 2 t t sup 0 s t x 2 s t sup 0 s t t x 2 s thus z 1 t t x 1 t t r 2 sup 0 s t t x 2 s we may then write 1 z 1 t t for every t 0 z 1 t t for every t 0 and l 1 t 0 x 1 t t r 2 sup 0 s t t x 2 s for every t 0 and l 1 t 0 7 p u v a s we now wish to show that p u v x 1 t t r 2 sup 0 s t t x 2 s for every t 0 and l 1 t 0 0 8 note that there is a set n such that p u v n 1 and for every n we have z 1 t t x 1 t t l 1 t t r 2 l 2 t t 0 9 z 2 t t x 2 t t r 1 l 1 t t l 2 t t 0 10 l 1 t t increases only when z 1 t t 0 11 l 2 t t increases only when z 2 t t 0 12 let n we claim that the following statements a x 1 t t r 2 sup 0 s t t x 2 s for every t 0 b l 1 t 0 cannot hold simultaneously the proof is by contradiction for sake of contradiction assume that statements a and b hold simultaneously by 10 12 and the uniqueness of skorokhod map we have l 2 t t sup 0 s t r 1 l 1 s t x 2 s t 6 philip a ernst sandro franceschi and dongzhou huang sup 0 s t r 1 l 1 s t sup 0 s t x 2 s t r 1 l 1 t t sup 0 s t t x 2 s let inf t l 1 t t 2 r 1 r 2 then for every t 0 z 1 t t x 1 t t l 1 t t r 2 l 2 t t x 1 t t r 2 l 2 t t x 1 t t r 2 sup 0 s t t x 2 s r 1 r 2 l 1 t t 2 2 where in the last inequality we have invoked statement a since l 1 t t increases only when z 1 t t 0 we have l 1 t t 0 for every t 0 which contradicts statement b and the definition of by contradiction 8 holds combining 7 and 8 5 follows note that 6 follows directly from 5 remark 2 to estimate the probability of the event x 1 t r 2 sup 0 s t x 2 s for every t 0 we note that the above event contains the intersection of the event x 1 t c for every t and the event sup 0 s t x 2 s c r 2 for every t for every positive c both of which correspond to the first hitting problems of one dimensional brownian motion with a drift we will use the idea repeatedly in the proofs of theorem 4 and lemma 8 we now turn to proposition 3 below which is a reformulation of the formula 1 2 4 1 on p 252 of 5 proposition 3 let b t be a one dimensional brownian motion started from the origin under p for 0 and x 0 we have p b t t x for every t 0 1 e 2 x with lemma 1 and proposition 3 in hand we state theorem 4 below theorem 4 when the starting point tends to infinity the probability that the process does not hit the origin tends to one namely lim u v p u v t 1 equivalently lim u v p u v t 0 proof fix 0 for u v sufficiently large we have u 2 or v 2 if u 2 by lemma 1 we have p u v t p u v 1 p u v x 1 t r 2 sup 0 s t x 2 s for every t 0 p u v x 1 t u 2 for every t 0 and x 2 t u 2 r 2 for every t 0 p u v x 1 t u 2 for every t 0 p u v x 2 t u 2 r 2 for every t 0 1 p u v w 1 t 1 t u 2 2 for every t 0 escape and absorption probabilities for brownian motion in a quadrant 7 p u v w 2 t 2 t u 2 r 2 v for every t 0 1 1 e u 2 1 1 e u r 2 2 v 2 1 1 e u 2 1 e u r 2 2 v 2 where the second to last equality invokes proposition 3 similarly if v 2 we have p u v t 1 e v 2 2 e v r 1 2 u 1 hence p u v t max 1 e u 2 1 e u r 2 2 v 2 1 u 2 1 e v 2 2 e v r 1 2 u 1 1 v 2 letting u v tend to the desired result follows we now turn to proposition 5 below which shall be needed to prove theorem 6 proposition 5 we have the following subset relationship u w 1 t 1 t 0 and v w 2 t 2 t 0 for some t r t proof we prove this claim by contradiction for the sake of contradiction let us fix u w 1 t 1 t 0 and v w 2 t 2 t 0 for some t r t assuming t the process can be written as z 1 t u w 1 t 1 t l 1 t r 2 l 2 t z 2 t v w 2 t 2 t r 1 l 1 t l 2 t solving the linear system for l 1 and l 2 we obtain r 1 r 2 1 l 1 t u w 1 t 1 t z 1 t r 2 v w 2 t 2 t z 2 t r 1 r 2 1 l 2 t r 1 u w 1 t 1 t z 1 t v w 2 t 2 t z 2 t for all t r such that u w 1 t 1 t 0 and v w 2 t 2 t 0 we have r 1 r 2 1 l 1 t 0 and r 1 r 2 1 l 2 t 0 which is not possible since l 1 t and l 2 t 0 and as we assumed r 1 r 2 1 0 a contradiction has been reached theorem 6 below considers the behavior of the process when the starting point tends to the origin theorem 6 when the starting point tends to the origin the probability that the process hits the origin in finite time tends towards one that is lim u v 0 0 p u v t 1 or equivalently lim u v 0 0 p u v t 0 proof by proposition 5 we have that p u v t p t r u w 1 t 1 t 0 and v w 2 t 2 t 0 by the properties of planar brownian motion we have p t r w 1 t 1 t 0 and w 2 t 2 t 0 1 let un vn r 2 be a sequence of points such that un vn 0 0 note that n 1 m n t r un w 1 t 1 t 0 and vn w 2 t 2 t 0 t r w 1 t 1 t 0 and w 2 t 2 t 0 8 philip a ernst sandro franceschi and dongzhou huang applying fatou s lemma yields lim inf n p t r un w 1 t 1 t 0 and vn w 2 t 2 t 0 1 we may therefore conclude that p un vn t n 1 and the desired result follows 2 2 complementarity of absorption and escape we now turn to theorem 10 which states that the process has only two possible behaviors either t or t in which case z t when t the result first requires the proofs of three auxiliary statements which we give below proposition 7 suppose b t is a one dimensional brownian motion starting from the origin under the measure p let a b be two positive numbers then p a bt b t a bt for every t 0 0 proof let ln 2 2 b 1 note that 1 2 e 2 b 0 then p bt b t bt for every t 0 p b t bt for every t 0 p b t bt for every t 0 1 2 1 e 2 b 1 1 2 e 2 b 0 let ha inf t b t a by standard exit time properties of brownian motion p ha b 1 0 then p a bt b t a bt for every t 0 p ha b 1 p a bt b t a bt for every t 0 ha b 1 by the strong markov property of brownian motion p a bt b t a bt t ha b 1 p a b t ha b t ha a b t ha t ha b 1 p a b t ha b ha b t ha b ha a b t ha b ha t ha b 1 p bt b t ha b ha bt t ha b 1 p bt b t bt t 0 from which the desired result follows we now turn to lemma 8 lemma 8 for a positive number inf u p u 0 0 1 0 13 inf v p 0 v 0 2 0 14 proof we need only prove 13 since the proof of 14 is completely symmetric let us consider by lemma 1 p u 0 0 1 p u 0 1 p u 0 x 1 t r 2 sup 0 s t x 2 s for every t 0 p u 0 u w 1 t 1 t r 2 sup 0 s t w 2 s 2 t for every t 0 p u 0 w 1 t 1 t u 2 for every t 0 and w 2 t 2 t u 2 r 2 for every t 0 15 escape and absorption probabilities for brownian motion in a quadrant 9 let b 1 t and b 2 t be two independent brownian motions starting from 0 under p u 0 then under p u 0 the process w 1 t w 2 t has the same law as b 1 t b 1 t 1 2 b 2 t we now show that 13 holds in three separate cases 0 0 1 and 1 0 case i 0 if 0 then w 1 t and w 2 t are two independent brownian motions then 15 p u 0 w 1 t 1 t u 2 for every t 0 p u 0 w 2 t 2 t u 2 r 2 for every t 0 1 e u 1 1 e u 2 r 2 where the last equality invokes proposition 3 taking infimums yields inf u p u 0 0 1 1 e 1 1 e 2 r 2 0 case ii 0 1 if 0 1 then 15 p u 0 b 1 t 1 t u 2 for every t 0 and b 1 t 1 2 b 2 t 2 t u 2 r 2 for every t 0 p u 0 b 1 t 1 2 t u 2 r 2 for every t 0 and 1 2 b 2 t 1 2 t 1 u 2 r 2 for every t 0 using the same argument in the case for 0 13 follows case iii 1 0 if 1 0 then for u 15 p u 0 b 1 t 1 t u 2 for every t 0 and b 1 t 1 2 b 2 t 2 t u 2 r 2 for every t 0 p u 0 b 1 t 1 t u 2 for every t 0 b 1 t 1 2 t u 2 r 2 for every t 0 and 1 2 b 2 t 2 1 2 t 1 u 2 r 2 for every t 0 p u 0 u 2 r 2 1 2 t b 1 t u 2 r 2 1 2 t t and 1 2 b 2 t 2

proposition 7 13 follows this concludes the proof let us denote tr inf t 0 z t t r lemma 9 for fixed n on the event t 1 n we have p u v a s lim t z t that is p u v lim inf t z t t 1 n 0 16 proof we will first show 16 holds when v 0 then 16 will follow immediately in the case u 0 we conclude by showing that 16 holds when u 6 0 and v 6 0 case i v 0 when v 0 let k sup u 0 p u 0 lim inf t z t t 1 n 10 philip a ernst sandro franceschi and dongzhou huang for u 1 n p u 0 lim inf t z t t 1 n 0 then k sup u 1 n p u 0 lim inf t z t t 1 n 17 we now define a stopping time 01 inf t 01 z 2 t 0 0 1 01 by lemma 8 inf u 1 n p u 0 0 1 inf u 1 n p u 0 0 1 0 and hence sup u 1 n p u 0 0 1 1 18 note that p u 0 lim inf t z t t 1 n p u 0 01 lim inf t z t t 1 n p u 0 01 0 1 lim inf t z t t 1 n p u 0 01 lim inf

hand side of 19 is 0 we now consider the second term on the right hand side of 19 on the event 01 let us define 0 1 inf t 0 z 2 t 0 1 0 and t 1 n inf t 0 z t 01 1 n by the strong markov property we have p u 0 01 0 1 lim inf t z t t 1 n p u 0 01 inf 0 s 01 z s 1 n 01 lim inf t z t 01 t 1 n e u 0 1 01 inf 0 s 0 1 z s 1 n pz 01 01 lim inf t z t t 1 n 0 by the same argument used to show that the first term on the right hand side of 19 is 0 for v 0 p 0 v 01 lim inf t z t t 1 n 0 this proves that the second term on the right hand side of 19 is also 0 we now consider the third term on the right

t z t t 1 n p u v lim inf t z t t 1 n 22 on the event t and for every t 0 l 1 t l 2 t 0 then as t z 1 t u w 1 t 1 t p u v a s hence the first term on the right hand side of 22 is 0 we now consider the second term on the right hand side of 22 by the strong markov property p u v lim inf t z t t 1 n e u v 1 pz lim inf t z t t 1 n 0 where 20 and 21 have been invoked in the last equality hence the second term on the right hand side of 22 is also 0 thus for u 6 0 and v 6 0 p u v lim inf t z t t 1 n 0 the proof is now complete with the above results in hand we are now ready to state theorem 10 theorem 10 on the event t p u v a s the process z t tends to infinity when t namely p u v lim t z t t 1 equivalently p u v lim inf t z t t 0 12 philip a ernst sandro franceschi and dongzhou huang proof we deduce from lemma 9 that for every n n p u v lim inf t z t t p u v lim inf t z t t 1 n t applying the strong markov property yields p u v lim inf t z t t 1 n t e u v 1 t 1 n pz t 1 n lim inf

study of the escape probability p u v t we begin with proposi tion 11 which provides partial differential equations characterizing the escape probability we proceed with proposition 12 which gives a functional equation satisfied by the laplace trans form of the escape probability note that there is no particular difficulty in defining the process starting from the edge except the origin let us define the infinitesimal generator of the process inside the quarter plane as gf u v lim t 0 1 t e u v f z t t f u v where f must be a bounded function in the quadrant to ensure that the above limit exists and is uniform for f twice differentiable the infinitesimal generator inside the quadrant is gf 1 2 2 f z 21 2 f z 22 2 2 f z 1 z 2 1 f z 1 2 f z 2 this leads us to proposition 11 proposition 11 partial differential equation the absorption probability f u v p u v t is the only function which is both i bounded and continuous in the quarter plane and on its boundary and ii continuously differentiable in the quarter plane and on its boundary except perhaps at the corner and which satisfies the partial differential equation gf u v 0 u v r 2 with oblique neumann boundary conditions r 1 f 0 v f u 0 v r 1 f v 0 v 0 v 0 r 2 f u 0 r 2 f u u 0 f v u 0 0 u 0 23 and with limit values f 0 0 1 lim u v f u v 0 the same result holds for the escape probability g u v 1 f u v p u v t but with the following limit values g 0 0 0 lim u v f u v 1 escape and absorption probabilities for brownian motion in a quadrant 13 remark that a similar partial differential equation with different limit values

similar to that in 21 except that in the present paper the drift is positive we define the functions x and y satisfying k x y y 0 and k x y x 0 escape and absorption probabilities for brownian motion in a quadrant 15 the branches are given by x y y 1 y 2 2 1 2 y 1 2 21 y x x 2 x 2 2 1 2 x 2 1 22 28 and the branch points of x and y which are roots of the polynomials in the square roots of 28 are given respectively by y 1 2 1 2 2 21 1 2 1 2 x 2 1 2 1 2 22 1 2 1 2 29 by 3 we obtain that y 1 1 cos sin sin 30 the functions x and y are analytic respectively on the cut planes c y y and c x x figure 4 below depicts the functions y on x x recall k 1 and k 2 as defined in 26 consider the intersection points between the ellipse k 0 and the lines k 1 0 and k 2 0 we define x 0 2 1 0 and y 0 2 2 0 31 x 1 2 r 2 2 1 1 r 22 2 r 2 0 and y 2 2 r 1 1 2 1 r 21 2 r 1 0 32 these points are represented on figure 4 and satisfy the following k x 0 0 k 2 x 0 0 0 k 0 y 0 k 1 0 y 0 0 y 1 r such that k x 1 y 1 k 2 x 1 y 1 0 x 2 r such that k x 2 y 2 k 1 x 2 y 2 0 let us define the curve h which is the boundary of the bvp established in section 6 1 h x y x c k x y 0 and y y 33 lemma 13 hyperbola h the curve h is a branch of the hyperbola of equation 2 1 x 2 2 y 2 2 1 2 x 1 1 2 2 34 the curve h is symmetrical with respect to the horizontal axis and is the right branch of the hyperbola if 0 further it is the left branch if 0 and it is a straight line if 0 proof a similar kernel has already been studied we refer the reader to 21 lemma 4 and 3 lemma 9 where the equation of such a hyperbola is derived let h denote the part of the hyperbola h with positive imaginary part we also define the domain g bounded by h and containing x this is depicted in figure 5 below 4 1 meromorphic continuation this section focuses on establishing the boundary value problem we begin by meromorphically continuing the laplace transform 1 x which con verges for x 0 lemma 14 meromorphic continuation by the formula 1 x k 2 x y x 2 y x k 1 x y x 35 the laplace transform 1 x can be meromorphically continued to the set s x c x 0 or y x 0 0 36 where the domain g and its boundary h are included in the set defined in 36 then 1 is meromorphic on g and is continuous on g 16 philip a ernst sandro franceschi and dongzhou huang figure 4 the ellipse k 0 the function y in blue the function y in red the two lines k 1 0 and k 2 0

and domain g proof the laplace transforms 1 x and 2 y are analytic respectively on x c x 0 and y c y 0 the functional equation 27 implies that for x y in the set s x y c 2 x 0 y 0 and x y 0 we have 0 k 1 x y 1 x k 2 x y 2 y 37 the open connected set s 1 x c y x 0 intersects the open set s 2 x c x 0 for x s 1 s 2 x y x s equation 37 implies that the continuation formula in 35 is satisfied for all x s 1 s 2 figure 6 represents escape and absorption probabilities for brownian motion in a quadrant 17 these sets with 1 x defined as in 35 we invoke the principle of analytic continuation and meromorphically extend 1 to s s 1 s 2 note that the inclusion of g in the set s defined in 36 is similar to that in 21 lemma 5 this inclusion is depicted below in figure 6 figure 6 the complex plane of x the red curve of equation y x 0 bounds the red domain s 1 x c y x 0 the orange dotted curve corresponds to the equation y x 0 the domain g is bounded on the left by the green hyperbola h contains

laplace transform 1 has either one or two poles as follows one pole if k 1 x y x 0 the point 0 is the unique pole of 1 in s and this pole is simple two poles if k 1 x y x 0 the points 0 and x 1 defined in 32 are the only possible poles of 1 in s and these poles are simple x 1 s if and only if x 1 x 0 in addition limx 0 x 1 x 1 further the point x 1 is a pole of 1 and belongs to the domain g if and only if k 1 x y y 0 proof the final value theorem for the laplace transform together with theorem 4 imply that lim x 0 x 1 x lim u p u 0 t 1 we may thus conclude that 0 is a simple pole on the set x c x 0 1 is defined as a laplace transform which converges and thus has no poles therefore with the exception of 0 the only possible poles in s are the zeros of k 1 x y x which are the zeros of the de nominator of the continuation formula in 35 straightforward calculations show that equation k 1 x y x 0 has either no roots or one simple root and that this depends on the sign of k 1 x y x when the root exists it is x 1 see 32 the condition for the existence of this root is depicted in figure 7 below it now only remains to remark that when x 1 is a pole x 1 is in g if and only if x 1 x y the latter holds if and only if k 1 x y y 0 see figure 8 before turning to lemma 16 recall that the angles and were defined above in 3 and that k 1 was defined in 26 18 philip a ernst sandro franceschi and dongzhou huang figure 7 on the left we see that k 1 x y x 0 and x 1 is a simple pole of 1 on the right we see that k 1 x y x 0 and 1 has no pole in s figure 8 on the left we see that k 1 x y y 0 and x 1 is in g on the right we see that k 1 x y y 0 and x 1 is not in g lemma 16 geometric conditions the condition k 1 x y x 0 resp 0 and 0 is equivalent to 2 resp and the condition k 1 x y y 0 resp 0 and 0 is equivalent to 2 2 resp 2 and 2 proof by condition 1 and by the fact that the drift is positive we have 0 by 3 and 29 x 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 1 cot cot 2 1 sin 38 we begin by proving the first equivalence for 2 in this case we have k 1 x y x 0 1 2 r 2 x y x x 2 0 escape and absorption probabilities for brownian motion in a quadrant 19 r 2 2 x since y x x 2 by 28 and 29 r 2

since 0 2 2 it is straightforward to see that if 2 then 2 further 2 is equivalent to r 2 0 by 3 which implies that r 2 2 x therefore k 1 x y y 0 this proves the first equivalence the second equivalence is proved in exactly the same way so the details are omitted this concludes the proof 4 3 absorption asymptotics along the axes in this section we establish asymptotic re sults for the absorption probability and escape probability in a simpler case where the starting point is u 0 proposition 17 absorption asymptotics let us assume that x s for some constant c the asymptotic behavior of p u 0 t as u is given by p u 0 t c eux 1 if 2 u 3 2 eux if 2 u 1 2 eux if 2 proof the largest singularity of the laplace transform of p u 0 t determines its asymp totics we proceed by invoking a classical transfer theorem see 11 theorem 37 1 this theorem says that if a is the largest singularity of order k of the laplace transform that is the laplace transform behaves as s a k up to additive and multiplicative constants in the neighborhood of a then when u the probability p u 0 t is equivalent up to a constant to uk 1 eau the laplace transform of p u 0 t is 1 x 1 x by lemma 15 the point 0 is not a singularity and the point x 1 is a simple pole when that pole exists the asymptotics are given by ceux 1 for some constant c when there is no pole that is when k 1 x y x 0 the largest singularity is given by the branch point x the definition of y and 35 together imply that for some constants ci we have 1 x x x c 1 c 2 x x o x x if k 1 x y x 0 c 3 x x o 1 if k 1 x y x 0 the proof is then completed by applying lemma 16 and invoking the classical transfer theorem remark 18 asymptotics along the vertical axis studying the singularities of 1 we obtained in proposition 17 the asymptotics of the absorption probability and then of the escape probability which is equal to 1 p u 0 t along the horizontal axis a similar study for 2 would lead 20 philip a ernst sandro franceschi and dongzhou huang to the following asymptotics along the vertical axis as v p 0 v t c evy 2 if 2 v 3 2 evy if 2 v 1 2 evy if 2 remark 19 bivariate asymptotics the bivariate asymptotics of the absorption probability could be derived using the saddle point method and studying the singularities see 19 and 13 such a study is very technical and requires to distinguish a lot of different cases we would obtain some functions a b c depending on the parameters such that for u v r cos t r sin t in polar coordinates p u v t r a t rb t e c t r typically b would take the values 0 or 1 2 5 product form and exponential absorption probability in this section we consider a remarkable geometric condition on the parameters characterizing the case where the absorption probability has a product form and is exponential we call this new criterion the dual skew symmetry condition due to its natural connection with the famous skew symmetry condition studied by harrison reiman and williams 25 28 which characterizes the cases where the stationary distribution has a product form and is exponential the dual skew symmetry condition gives a criterion for the solution to the partial differential equation of proposition 11 dual to that satisfied by the invariant measure to be of product form the following theorem states a simple geometric criterion on the parameters for the absorption probability to be of product form the absorption probability is then exponential theorem 20 dual skew symmetry let f u v p u v t be the absorption probability the following statements are equivalent 1 the absorption probability has a product form i e there exist f 1 and f 2 such that f u v f 1 u f 2 v 2 the absorption probability is exponential i e there exist x and y in r such that f u v eux vy 3 the reflection vectors are in opposite directions i e r 1 r 2 1 4 the reflection angles in the wedge satisfy 1 i e in this case we have f u v eux 1 vy 2 where x 1 and y 2 are given in 32 proof 1 2 neumann boundary conditions 23 imply that f 1 0 f 2 y r 1 f 1 0 f 2 y 0 and r 2 f 1 u f 2 0 f 1 u f 2 0 0 solving these differential equations imply that f 1 and f 2 and thus f are exponential 2 1 this implication is straightforward 2 3 neumann boundary conditions 23 imply that for all v 0 xevy r 1 yevy 0 and that for all u 0 r 2 xeux yeux 0 it follows that r 1 x y r 2 y x and thus r 1 r 2 1 3 2 let us define f u v eux 1 vy 2 we need to show that f satisfies the partial differential equation of proposition 11 this will imply that f is the absorption probability the fact that r 1 1 r 2 combined with 32 gives r 1 x 1 y 2 this implies that f satisfies the neumann boundary conditions in 23 the limit values are satisfied because f 0 0 1 and escape and absorption probabilities for brownian motion in a quadrant 21 lim u v f u v 0 for x 1 0 and y 2 0 it now only remains to show that gf 0 we now only need verify that k x 1 y 2 0 see figure 9 by definition of y 2 see 32 we have k x 1 y 2 y 2 y 2 2 x 1 y 2 2 1 2 x 1 y 2 1 x 1 y 2 2 y 2 y 2 2 r 21 1 2 r 1 1 r 1 2 0 3 4 the following equivalences hold r 1 r 2 1 sin tan cos sin tan cos 1 by 3 sin tan tan sin cos tan cos tan 1 cos 2 cos sin sin cos tan tan tan tan 1 tan tan tan tan remark 21 standard and dual skew symmetry the standard skew symmetry condition for the matrix 1 r 2 r 1 1 is 2 r 1 r 2 or equivalently the standard skew symmetry condition for the dual matrix r 2 1 1 r 1 defined in section 1 5 is 2 1 r 1 1 r 2 or equivalently 2 note that the dual skew symmetry condition obtained in theorem 20 is different from these two conditions further properties of the dual skew symmetry condition will be explored in future work figure 9 dual skew symmetry on the left we see that k x 2 y 2 0 on the right we see that condition r 1 r 2 1 implies that the reflection vectors are in opposite directions 6 integral expression of the laplace transform 1 in this section we establish a boundary value problem bvp satisfied by the laplace trans form proposition 22 the section s key result is theorem 30 which gives an explicit integral formula for the laplace transform of the escape probability 22 philip a ernst sandro franceschi and dongzhou huang 6 1 carleman boundary value problem we state a carleman bvp satisfied by the laplace transform 1 proposition 22 carleman bvp the laplace transform 1 satisfies the following boundary value problem i 1 x is meromorphic on g and continuous on g ii 1 x admits one or two poles in g 0 is always a simple pole and x 1 is a simple pole if and only if 2 2 iii limx x 1 x 0 iv 1 satisfies the boundary condition 1 x g x 1 x x h where g x k 1 k 2 x y x k 2 k 1 x y x 39 proof statement i immediately follows from lemma 14 statement ii immediately follows from lemmas 15 and 16 statement iii follows from the initial value theorem for the laplace transform which implies that limx x 1 x p 0 0 t 0 to prove statement iv we recall the functional equation 27 for x h we evaluate this equation for x y x and x y x by the definition of y we have k x y x k x y x 0 by the definition of the hyperbola h in 34 we have y x y x this enables us to obtain the following system of equations 0 k 1 x y x 1 x k 2 x y x 2 y x 0 k 1 x y x 1 x k 2 x y x 2 y x solving this system of equations and eliminating 2 y x we obtain the boundary condition in statement iv 6 2 gluing function to solve the bvp we need a conformal gluing function which glues together the upper and lower parts of the hyperbola this conformal gluing function was intro duced in 20 21 for a 0 and for x c 1 the generalized chebyshev polynomial is defined by ta x cos a arccos x 1 2 x x 2 1 a x x 2 1 a we define the angle arccos we also define the functions w x t 2 x x x x x 40 and w x w x w x y w x w 0 we now recall a useful lemma from 21 for the conformal gluing function w lemma 23 lemma 9 21 the function w satisfies the following properties i w is holomorphic in g 0 continuous in g 0 and bounded at infinity ii w is bijective from g 0 to c 0 1 iii w satisfies the gluing property on the hyperbola w x w x x h escape and absorption probabilities for brownian motion in a quadrant 23 6 3 index we begin with some necessary notation let the angle be the variation of the argument of g x when x lies on h argg x h arg k 1 k 2 x y x h further let d be the argument of g at the real point of the hyperbola h d argg x y we define the index as d 2 the index shall prove useful to solving the boundary value problem given in proposition 22 lemma 24 we have d 0 if k 1 x y x 6 0 i e 2 6 2 if k 1 x y x 0 i e 2 2 and tan d 2 1 r 1 2 r 2 2 1 2 r 1 r 2 3 r 1 r 2 2 r 1 r 2 2 4 3 tan note also that 2 is equivalent to 1 r 1 2 r 2 2 6 0 proof the proof is in each step similar to the proof of 21 lemma 13 firstly note that the value of d is obtained by the fact that g x y 1 if k 1 x y x 6 0 and that g x y 1 if k 1 x y x 0 we recall that by definition we have lim x x h argg x d and that by 39 we have g x 1 2 r 2 y x x 2 x 1 2 1 r 1 y x x y x x 1 x 1 2 r 2 y x x 2 x 1 2 1 r 1 y x x y x x 1 x by 28 we may compute the limit lim x x h y x x i 1 2 from which we obtain ei d lim x x h g x r 2 i 1 2 1 r 1 2 2 i r 1 2 1 2 r 2 i 1 2 1 r 1 2 2 i r 1 2 1 2 r 2 1 r 1 2 2 r 1 2 1 2 i 1 r 1 r 2 2 r 1 r 2 4 2 1 2 r 2 1 r 1 2 2 r 1 2 1 2 i 1 r 1 r 2 2 r 1 r 2 4 2 1 2 we then see that tan d 2 1 r 1 r 2 2 r 1 r 2 4 2 1 2 r 2 1 r 1 2 2 r 1 2 1 2 tan where the last equality follows from 3 and straightforward calculations the proof concludes by recalling the two following facts 1 for 1 and for and 0 we have that 2 6 2 2 by 3 sin has the same sign as that r 1 2 r 2 2 1 where r 1 2 r 2 2 1 sin sin sin sin 24 philip a ernst sandro franceschi and dongzhou huang we now prepare to state lemma 25 below for 1 r 1 2 r 2 2 6 0 let us define y 2 2 1 r 2 2 r 1 2 r 2 2 1 2 1 sin sin sin sin 41 where the last equality holds by 3 lemma 25 if y y 6 0 or if 1 r 1 2 r 2 2 0 then g x 1 and x h x x y and thus d 2 2 if y y 0 then g x 1 and x h x x y or x x y and thus d 4 4 proof assume that x h where x a ib for a b r and y y x then by 39 g x 1 is equivalent to k 1 a ib y k 2 a ib y 0 straightforward calculations yield k 1 a ib y k 2 a ib y b 4 y 2 r 1 2 r 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 r 2 2 from which we may obtain that g x 1 is equivalent to b 0 or to y y we conclude the proof by noting that 1 b 0 and x h together imply that x x y the latter being the only real point of the hyperbola 2 by the definition of 33 x h and y y imply that y y we continue with lemma 26 below lemma 26 assume that 2 2 then y y is equivalent to 2 proof we first note that 2 2 implies that 2 and thus that sin 0 recall that we have previously seen that the conditions in 1 are equivalent to 1 and and thus that 3 we employ the following steps to conclude the proof 1 assume that y y then for y 0 we have that y 0 then by 41 we have that sin 0 and thus 2 2 we now assume that 2 hence sin 0 by hypothesis we have 2 using 41 we may easily see that 7 y is increasing for 2 replacing by in 41 we may deduce that y y 2 1 sin sin sin sin 2 by hypothesis we have that 2 2 2 note that 7 y is increasing in this interval we then see that y yinf 2 1 sin 2 sin sin sin 2 2 employing 30 and performing straightforward calculations we obtain y y yinf y 1 2 sin 2 sin 2 2 sin sin sin 0 before stating the main lemma of this section we introduce the following indicator variable which is associated with the results of lemma 15 and lemma 16 1 if 2 2 x 1 is a pole of 1 in g 0 if 2 6 2 1 has no pole but 0 in g 42 escape and absorption probabilities for brownian motion in a quadrant 25 lemma 27 index the index satisfies if 2 1 if 2 the value of the index appears below in table 1 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 6 2 0 1 table 1 value of the index remark 28 index and argument principle notice that the index can take the values 0 1 and 2 while in 21 lemma 14 the index takes only the values 0 and 1 the difference comes from the fact that 1 can have two distinct poles while in 21 the laplace transform has at most one simple pole the index is deeply connected to number of zeros and poles of 1 in the case of a closed curve the argument principle implies that the index is equal to the number of zeros minus the number of poles counted with multiplicity of the function of the bvp see 17 lemma 6 9 which presents a case where the boundary of the bvp is a circle in our case the boundary is an unbounded hyperbola and 1 is not meromorphic at infinity therefore we cannot apply directly the argument principle and the index is not always equal to the opposite of the number of poles proof the proof proceeds with two separate cases case i y y 6 0 in this case by lemma 25 we have that d 2 2 and that g x 6 1 for all x h such that x 6 x y then 0 or 1 depending on the sign of d this sign is given by the sign of argg x when x h and x x y note that x a ib h and y y x we then compute k 1 a ib y k 2 a ib y k 1 a y k 2 a y b 2 4 r 2 2 i b 4 1 r 1 2 r 2 2 y y figure 10 represents the curve c k 1 k 2 x y x x h it is useful to remark that arg k 1 k 2 x y x arg k 1 x y x k 2 x y x we may thus deduce that sgn argg x sgn arg k 1 a ib y k 2 a ib y sgn b 1 r 1 2 r 2 2 y y k 1 a y k 2 a y b 2 4 r 2 2 for x h we have k 2 x y y 0 b 0 when x x y we have that b 0 and a x y thus for x h and x x y sgn argg x sgn k 1 x y y 1 r 1 2 r 2 2 y y sgn 2 2 sgn 2 where the last equality comes from lemmas 16 and 24 as well as from the fact that in this case y y 0 for y y this allows us to conclude the following if 2 and 2 2 then for x h and x x y the sign of argg x is negative we may thus deduce that 1 see figure 10 a if 2 and 2 6 2 then for x h and x x y the sign of argg x is positive we may thus deduce that 0 see figure 10 b 26 philip a ernst sandro franceschi and dongzhou huang if 2 and 2 6 2 then for x h and x x y the sign of argg x is positive we may thus deduce that 1 see figure 10 c we pause to note that by lemma 26 it is not possible to have 2 and 2 2 this is because we have assumed y 6 y case ii y y 0 in this case by lemma 25 we have that d 4 4 and g x 1 and x h x x y or x x y then 2 1 0 1 to obtain the value of the index we study the curve c k 1 k 2 x y x x h by straightforward calculations we see that a k 1 k 2 x y y is positive the study of the sign of the real and the imaginary parts of k 1 k 2 x y x for x h and x x y gives the value of following the same logic as that of case i above we see that the real part of k 1 k 2 x y x for x h and x x y has the same sign as 2 2 further the imaginary part has the same sign that 2 we may then conclude as follows

probability 1 theorem 30 explicit expression for 1 the laplace transform 1 is given for x g by 1 x w 0 w x w 0 w 0 w x 1 w x w x 1 exp 1 2 i h logg t w t w t w x w t w t w 0 dt 43 where x 1 is defined in 32 g is defined 39 w is defined 40 is defined in 42 and h is defined in 34 remark 31 let us now give some remarks about theorem 30 the poles 0 and x 1 found in lemma 15 can be easily visualized in the formula of theo rem 30 the indicator variable defined in 42 indicates clearly on the formula if the pole x 1 is in g or not a symmetrical result holds for 2 using the functional equation 27 we obtain an ex plicit formula for by inverting this laplace transform we obtain the escape probability which is the main motivation of our work but such an inversion is not easy neither very explicit except in some special cases but it is still possible to deduce some concrete results from the integral formula obtained in theorem 30 in section 7 we derive thanks to this explicit expression a very explicit and simple expression for the asymptotics of the escape probability at the origin it can also be used to show some differential properties of the laplace transform more precisely similarly to 6 thm 2 3 9 1 we can show that 1 is differentially algebraic if q such results on the algebraic nature of a generating function are very classical in analytic combinatorics to obtain concrete results when 1 is differentially algebraic it satisfies a differential equation from which it is possible to deduce a polynomial recurrence relation for the moments of the escape absorption probability see 6 6 3 which gives an explicit example for the srbm stationary distribution in the recurrent case the methods and techniques employed to prove this theorem are inspired by the one used to study random walks in the quarter plane 15 proof let 1 y y w x 1 y 1 1 1 w 1 y proposition 22 lemma 23 and lemma 27 together imply that 1 is analytic on c 0 1 1 y cy for some constant c 1 1 0 for y 0 1 1 satisfies the boundary condition 1 y g y 1 y where 1 y is the left limit and 1 y is the right limit of 1 on 0 1 w 1 is the right limit of w 1 on 0 1 and g y g w 1 y we now define s y y 1 exp 1 2 i 1 0 log g u u y following the classical boundary theory results in 15 5 2 24 and theorem 5 2 3 the above function is analytic and does not cancel on c 0 1 and is such that s y c y for some constant c furthermore for y 0 1 it satisfies the boundary condition s y g y s y escape and absorption probabilities for brownian motion in a quadrant 29 where s y is the left limit and s y is the right limit of s on 0 1 by the properties of 1 and s detailed above the function 1 s is analytic on c and bounded at infinity therefore there must exist a constant c such that 1 y cs y invoking the definition of 1 we have that w x w x 1 w x 1 1 1 x c w x 1 exp 1 2 i 1 0 log g u u w x 44 noting that w x 1 w 0 w x y w x w 0 and w x w x 1 w x w x 1 w x w 0 w x y w 0 w x 1 w 0 and making a change of variable u w t in the integral in 44 we obtain for some constant c 1 x c 1 w x w 0 1 w x w x 1 exp 1 2 i h logg t w t w t w x dt the final value theorem for the laplace transform gives lim x 0 x 1 x lim u p u 0 t 1 this enables us to compute the constant c w 0 w 0 w x 1 exp 1 2 i h logg t w t w t w 0 dt which gives us 43 completing the proof 7 asymptotics of the escape probability at the origin in this section we use the explicit expression in theorem 30 to obtain the asymptotics of the escape probability at the origin we begin with computing the asymptotics of 1 at infinity lemma 32 asymptotics of 1 let be defined as in 4 for ease of notation allow c to be a constant which may change from one line to the next for some positive constant c 1 x x cx 1 a symmetrical result holds for 2 that is for some positive constant c 2 y y cy 1 proof this proof follows the same steps as those of 21 prop 19 the key is to invoke 15 5 2 20 which states that exp 1 2 i 1 0 log g u u y y 1 c y 1 d 2 recall that w x x cx and that w x 1 x cx the explicit expressions of 1 obtained in 43 and in 44 imply that 1 x x cx d 2 1 the proof concludes by invoking lemma 29 which states that d 2 1 1 lemma 33 asymptotics of let defined as in 4 for t 0 2 and some positive constant ct r cos t r sin t r ctr 2 30 philip a ernst sandro franceschi and dongzhou huang proof the result is immediate from the functional equation 27 and lemma 32 proposition 34 asymptotics at the origin for positive constants c 0 and c 1 we have the following asymptotics p u 0 t u 0 c 0 u and p 0 v t v 0 c 1 v proof the result follows by combining the asymptotic results of 1 and 2 at infinity that we computed in lemma 32 with the reciprocal of the result in 11 thm 33 3 2 we begin by denoting g u p u 0 t then by definition 1 x 0 e xug u du as 1 x has no singularities greater than 0 for every a 0 the inverse laplace transform gives g u 1 2 i a i a i eux 1 x dx by lemma 32 we have 1 x c x x 1 where is a function such that lim 0 recalling that the laplace transform of u 1 is x 1 and performing a change of variables s ux we obtain g u 1 2 i a i a i eux c x x 1 dx u c 1 1 2 i au i au i es s u s 1 ds it remains to show that the last integral tends to 0 when u 0 to do so consider 0 arbitrarily small then there exists b 0 sufficiently large such that x for all x b for all u such that u 1 b let us consider a 1 u this gives 12 i au i au i es s u s 1 ds 2 i 1 i 1 i 1 s 1 ds where the last integral converges for 1 the proof concludes by letting tend towards 0 theorem 35 asymptotics at the origin for t 0 2 and some positive constant ct we have p r cos t r sin t t r 0 ctr proof this proof follows directly from the asymptotics of the double laplace transform com puted in lemma 33 recall the result used in the proof of proposition 34 linking the asymptotics of a function at 0 to the asymptotics of its laplace transform at infinity the only necessary modification is to apply this result with a polar coordinate transformation the desired asymp totics then follows with nearly identical calculations acknowledgments we thank l c g rogers for many inspiring conversations and motiva tional ideas without which this paper would not
