multivariate stochastic processes over a finite time horizon that we call generalised liouville processes glps glps are markov processes constructed by splitting le vy random bridges into non overlapping subprocesses via time changes we show that the terminal values and the increments of glps have generalised multivariate liouville distributions justifying their name we provide various other properties of glps and some examples keywords le vy process le vy bridge markov process multivariate liouville distribution msc 2010 60 1 introduction le vy random bridges lrbs le vy processes conditioned to have a fixed marginal law at a fixed future date have been applied to various problems in credit risk modelling asset pricing and insurance see for example 2 4 5 6 14 in 15 the authors present a bivariate insurance reserving model by splitting an lrb in this case based on the 1 2 stable subordinator in two the two subprocesses are transformed to span the same time horizon and are used to model the accumulation of insurance claims in a similar fashion the present authors constructed in 16 two classes of multivariate process by splitting and transforming an lrb based on the gamma process the first class archimedean survival processes provide a natural link between stochastic processes and archimedean copulas and was applied to a copula interpolation problem the second more general class was the class of liouville processes so named because the finite dimensional distributions of a liouville process are multivariate liouville distributions 8 10 11 12 this more general class was applied to the joint modelling of realised variance for two stock indices we extend the splitting and transformation mechanism to a general lrb to create what we call a generalised liouville process glp we show that the sum of coordinates of glps are one dimensional lrbs and prove that the finite dimensional distributions of glps are generalised multivariate liouville distributions as defined in 13 we show that glps are markov processes and that there exists a measure change under which the law of an n dimensional glp is that of a vector of n independent le vy processes we prove that any integrable glp admits a canonical semimartingale representation with respect to its natural filtration we also show that glps are multivariate harnesses we prove that glps satisfy the weak markov consistency condition but not necessarily the strong markov consistency condition similarly we introduce what we call weak and strong semimartingale consistency properties and show that glps have the former but not necessarily the latter the class of glps contains as special cases archimedean survival processes liouville processes and the bivariate process based on the 1 2

throughout much of this work we focus on processes taking continuous values however although details are omitted many results are straightforward to extend to processes on a lattice indeed later we provide examples of both a continuous and a discrete glp more specifically we consider what we call brownian liouville processes and poisson liouville processes and present some of their special characteristics 2 preliminaries throughout this work for a vector x rn we denote the sum of its coordinates by 1 x i xi we work on a probability space f p equipped with a filtration ft t 0 we fix a finite time horizon t 0 t for some t and assume ft 0 t t and all its sub filtrations are right continuous and complete unless stated otherwise every stochastic process is ca dla g with a state space that is a continuous subspace of rn b rn for some n n where b rn is the borel field let xt t 0 be a le vy process taking values in r such that the law of xt is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure for every t 0 t in this case the density ft of xt exists and satisfies the chapman kolmogorov convolution identity ft x r ft s x y fs y dy for 0 s t t and x r having independent and stationary increments the finite dimensional law of xt 0 t t is given by p xt 1 dx 1 xtm dxm m i 1 fti ti 1 xi xi 1 dxi for m n 0 t 1 tm t and x 1 xn r a le vy bridge is a le vy process conditioned to take some fixed value at a fixed future time since le vy processes are homogenous strong markov processes the definition of their bridges can be formalised in terms of doob h transformations see 9 for further details on the bridges of markov processes let x z t t 0 t t be a bridge of xt 0 t t to the value z r at time t where 0 ft z the transition density of x z t t 0 t t is given by the following doob h transform of the transition density of xt 0 t t p x z t t dx x z s t y ht x hs y ft s x y dx 1 for 0 s t t where ht x ft t z x note that ht 0 t t defined as such is harmonic with respect to xt 0 t t note also that p 0 ht x z t t 1 for all 0 t t so the ratios of densities in 1 are almost surely well defined this is discussed in the remark following proposition 1 of 9 similar ratios feature throughout this work and are likewise almost surely well defined and we may pass by them without further comment le vy random bridges lrbs are an extension of le vy bridges their interpretation in 14 is as a bridge to an arbitrary random variable at time t rather than a fixed value a process lt 0 t t is an lrb with generating law if it satisfies i lt has marginal law ii there exists a le vy process xt 0 t t such that the density ft of xt exists for all t 0 t iii concentrates mass where ft is positive and finite a s iv for all m n every 0 t 1 tm t every x 1 xm rm and a e z p lt 1 x 1 ltm xm lt z p xt 1 x 1 xtm xm xt z the finite dimensional distribution of lt 0 t t is given by p lt 1 dx 1 ltm dxm lt dz m i 1 fti ti 1 xi xi 1 dxi tm dz xm 2 2 where 0 dz y dz and t dz y dz ft t z y ft z for t 0 t it follows that lrbs are markov processes with stationary increments where the transition law of lt 0 t t is p lt dz ls y s dz y s r y p lt dx ls y t r x s r y ft s x y dx 3 for 0 s t we note that the finite dimensional distributions of lrbs with discrete state spaces have similar transition probabilities given in terms of probability mass functions for details see 14 the extension of many later results to discrete processes follows from this remark 2 1 note that 3 is also a doob h transform of the transition density of xt 0 t t and t r xt 0 t t is a positive fxt p martingale where fxt xu 0 u t let x 1 xn be random variables taking values in r with a joint density of the form p n i 1 xi n i 1 ai xi 4 where a 1 an 0 are parameters and the set of functions a a 0 satisfies the convolution property a b a b in 13 this is referred to as a liouville density function indeed according to the definition given in 13 x 1 xn then has a liouville distribution although we prefer to refer to this as the generalised liouville distribution to distinguish it from the original and special case that a are gamma densities see 8 10 11 12 the actual definition of the generalised liouville distribution given in 13 replaces the functions a with measures and so it includes examples where the joint density may not exist for our purposes it is convenient to relax 4 in a different way we keep a but replace the function p with a measure definition 2 2 let x 1 xn be random variables taking values in r b r r be a probability law and a a 0 a a be a family of functions satisfying the convolution property a b a b for a b a then x 1 xn has a generalised multivariate liouville distribution if its joint probability law is of the form p x 1 dx 1 xn 1 dxn 1 n i

xn 1 dxn 1 xn dxn p i xi 1 a i xi n i 1 ai xi dxi 3 3 generalised liouville processes to construct a glp we start with a master lrb lt 0 t un for un r and n 2 where lun has marginal law we assume that has no continuous singular part and split lt 0 t un into n non overlapping subprocesses definition 3 1 for m 1 mn 0 n 2 define the strictly increasing sequence ui ni 1 by u 0 0 and ui ui 1 mi for i 1 n then a process t 0 t 1 is an n dimensional generalised liouville process glp if t 0 t 1 law ltm 1 l 0 ltmi ui 1 lui 1 ltmn un 1 lun 1 0 t 1 for some lrb lt 0 t un with generating law we say that the generating law of t 0 t 1 is and the activity parameter of t 0 t 1 is m m 1 mn we have restricted the definition of glps to the time horizon 0 1 for convenience it is straightforward to generalise to an arbitrary closed time horizon each coordinate i t 0 t 1 of t 0 t 1 is a subprocess of an lrb since subprocesses of lrbs are themselves lrbs see 14 glps form a multivariate generalisation of lrbs for the rest of the paper we let t 0 t 1 be an n dimensional glp with generating law and lt 0 t un be the master process of t 0 t 1 in addition we denote the filtration generated by t 0 t 1 by f t 0 t 1 ft 0 t 1 explicitly we have f t u 0 u t remark 3 2 the bivariate model of insurance claims based on the 1 2 stable subordinator pro posed in 15 is a glp remark 3 3 liouville processes and archimedean survival processes as introduced in 16 form a subclass of glps in definition 3 1 if the lrb lt 0 t un is a gamma random bridge with unit activity parameter then we have a liouville process if we further fix mi 1 for i 1 n then we have an archimedean survival processes proposition 3 4 the following hold for any glp t 0 t 1 1 the increments of t 0 t 1 have a generalised multivariate liouville distribution 2 the terminal value 1 has a generalised multivariate liouville distribution proof see appendix in what follows we define a family of unnormalised measures t 0 t 1 such that 0 b x b t b x b f 1 m 1 t z x f 1 m z dz 7 for t 0 1 x r and b b r we also write t x t r x we define rt to be the sum of coordinates of t rt n i 1 i t 1 t proposition 3 5 the glp t 0 t 1 is a markov process with the transition law given by p 1 1 dz 1 n 1 1 dzn 1 n 1 b s x s b n 1 i 1 zi xn n 1 i 1 zi s 1 x n 1 i 1 f 1 s mi zi xi dzi 4 and p t dy s x t 1 y s 1 x n i 1 f t s mi yi xi dyi 8 where x y rn t 1 mn 1 t 1 m 0 s t 1 and b b r proof see appendix remark 3 6 from proposition 3 5 if the generating law admits a density p we get a neater transition law to the terminal value given by p 1 dz s x p 1 z s 1 x f 1 m 1 z n i 1 f 1 s mi zi xi dzi remark 3 7 our definition of glps is somewhat heuristic a formal definition is possible through a doob h transform since t 0 t 1 is harmonic to a le vy process xt t 0 taking values in rn with marginal density gt x n i 1 fmit xi to see this note that we can alternatively write 8 as p t dy s x t y s x gt s y x dy where t x t 1 x for 0 t 1 to see that t 0 t 1 is harmonic to x 0 t 1 note that rn gt s y x t y dy rn n i 1 f t s mi yi xi t y dy r rn f 1 m 1 t z 1 y n i 1 f t s mi yi xi dy d z f 1 m z r f 1 m 1 s z 1 x d z f 1 m z 9 s x for 0 s t 1 where 9 follows from repeated use of the convolution property of ft 0 t 1 m remark 3 7 demonstrates that the laws of t 0 t 1 and xt 0 t 1 are equivalent which we formalise by the corollary below corollary 3 8 suppose that t t 0 is a le vy process under measure p with p t dx gt x dx then t rt 1 0 t 1 is a radon nikodym density process that defines the measure change dp dp f t t rt 1 0 t 1 10 and t 0 t 1 is a p glp with generating law and activity parameter m proof see appendix remark 3 9 let st b p rt b f s for 0 s t 1 and b b r given s the increment t s has a generalised multivariate liouville distribution with generating law st b rs for b b r and parameter vector m t s proposition 3 10 given 1 the process t 0 t 1 is a vector of independent le vy bridges proof for all s 0 1 the transition probabilities to t s t 1 can be computed from 8 by first substituting with the dirac measure 1 z in 7 yielding p t dy 1 z f s n i 1 fmi t s yi i s fmi 1 t zi yi fmi 1 s zi i s dyi for almost every z rn conditional on 1 z we see that the transition laws of the coordinates of t 0 t 1 are independent and that each is the transition law of a le vy bridge 5 using the markov property of t 0 t 1 we can also provide the conditional laws of the coordinates i t given f i s i u 0 u s or given f s for s t proposition 3 11 the coordinates of t 0 t 1 have the following transition laws 1 the marginally conditioned case p i t dyi i s xi i t yi i s xi f t s mi yi xi dyi where i t x r f 1 m tmi r x f 1 m r dr 2 the fully conditioned case p i t dyi s x i t x yi s 1 x f t s mi yi xi dyi where i t x y r f 1 m 1 s t s mi r 1 x y xi f 1 m r dr for 0 s t 1 proof see appendix proposition 3 12 the process rt 0 t 1 is an lrb with generating law and the transition law p r 1 dr s x s dr 1 x s 1 x 11 p rt dr s x t r s 1 x f t s 1 m r 1 x dr 12 proof see appendix the next statement is a key result for defining stochastic integrals of integrable lrbs and hence integrable glps proposition 3 13 if e rt for all t 0 1 then rt 0 t 1 admits the canonical semi martingale representation rt t 0 e r 1 f s rs 1 s ds mt 13 for 0 t 1 where mt 0 t 1 is an f t p martingale with initial state m 0 0 proof from proposition 3 12 rt 0 t 1 is an lrb hence if e rt for all t 0 1 then e rt s x 1 t 1 s 1 x t s 1 s e r 1 s x s 0 t 14 6 we shall use 14 to prove that mt 0 t 1 given in 13 is an f t martingale since t 0 t 1 is markov e mt ms f s e rt rs f s t s e r 1 s e ru s 1 u du 1 t 1 s 1 s t s 1 s e r 1 s rs t s e r 1 s 1 u du t s 1 1 u 1 u 1 s 1 s u s 1 s e r 1 s du 0 for 0 s t 1 given e rt e t 0 e r 1 s rs 1 s ds for 0 t 1 remains to be shown e t 0 e r 1 s rs 1 s ds e t 0 e r 1 s 1 s ds e t 0 rs 1 s ds t 0 e e r 1 s 1 s ds t 0 e rs 1 s ds since e r 1 f t 0 t 1 is a martingale hence e mt for 0 t 1 finally m 0 0 since r 0 0 remark 3 14 let t 1 t 1 and t e r 1 t then drt t t rt dt dmt for 0 t 1 in this form the dynamics of lrbs resemble those of an ornstein uhlenbeck process with an increasing mean reversion rate t 0 t 1 and a state dependent reversion level t 0 t 1 we can write rt t 0 1 t 1 s 2 e r 1 s ds t 0 1 t 1 s dms for 0 s t 1 the following two propositions are motivated by 18 we first recall that a measurable process ht t 0 is called a harness if for all t 0 e ht and for all 0 a b c d e hc hb c b ha d hd ha d a where ha d ht t a ht t d proposition 3 15 if e 1 t for t 0 1 then t 0 t 1 and rt 0 t 1 are harnesses proof see appendix proposition 3 16 let be a c 1 function if e rt for all t 0 1 then the stochastic process zt 0 t 1 defined by zt e r 1 t rt 1 t 1 t u du t 0 u dru 0 t 1 is an f t p martingale 7 proof we have e 1 t u dru f t 1 e r 1 f t t rt 1 t e ru f t d u e r 1 t rt 1 t 1 t u du from the integration by parts formula 14 and the markov property of t 0 t 1 hence zt e 1 0 u dru f t which is an f t p martingale similar to proposition 3 13 we have the following result we omit the proof to avoid repetition proposition 3 17 if e t for all t 0 1 then t 0 t 1 admits the canonical semi martingale representation t t 0 e 1 f s s 1 s ds mt 0 t 1 15 where mt 0 t 1 is an f t p martingale in 17 it is shown that archimedean survival processes satisfy the weak markov consistency condition but not necessarily the strong markov consistency condition motivated by this propo sition 3 18 below provides a generalised version of this result for glps first we recall the weak and strong markov consistency conditions let xt t 0 be an n dimensional real valued markov process and fxt xu 0 u t also for each coordinate process x i t t 0 i 1 n write fx i t x i u 0 u t fxt the process xt t 0 satisfies the weak markov consistency condition if p x i t b fx i s p x i t b x i s 16 for every i 1 n and every b b r further xt t 0 satisfies the strong markov consis tency condition if p x i t b fxs p x i t b x i s 17 for every i 1 n and every b b r proposition 3 18 any glp t 0 t 1 is weak markov consistent but not necessarily strong markov consistent proof each coordinate i t 0 t 1 of the glp t 0 t 1 is an lrb since every subprocess of an lrb is an lrb see 14 thus 16 is satisfied for every i 1 n every b b r and all 0 s t 1 however 17 does not necessarily hold since p i t i s dy f s p i t i s dy j j s is only equal to p i t i s dy i s if both j j s and i s are independent from the increment i t i s for all 0 s t 1 in such a case the coordinates of t 0 t 1 are independent le vy processes in the same spirit we shall introduce weak and strong semimartingale consistency conditions definition 3 19 below goes beyond a markov setting but in the context of glps it offers links to markov consistency definition 3 19 let st t 0 be an fst p semimartingale where fst su 0 u t let s i t t 0 be a coordinate of st t 0 and fs i t s i u 0 u t for i 1 n 8 1 if s i t t 0 admits a decomposition s i t a i t m i t where a i t t 0 is a ca dla g fs i t adapted process with bounded variation and m i t t 0 is an fs i t p local martingale then st t 0 is weakly semimartingale consistent with respect to s i t t 0 if this holds for every i 1 n then st t 0 satisfies the weak semimartingale consistency condition 2 let st t 0 be decomposed as st at m t where at t 0 is a ca dla g fst adapted process with bounded variation and m t t 0 is an fst p local martingale with coordi nates a i t t 0 and m i t t 0 respectively given that s i t a i t m i t if a i t t 0 is fs i t adapted and m i t t 0 is an fs i t p local martingale then st t 0 is strongly semimartingale consistent with respect to s i t t 0 if this holds for every i 1 n then st t 0 satisfies the strong semimartingale consistency condition proposition 3 20 any glp t 0 t 1 where e t for all t 0 1 is weak semimartin gale consistent but not necessarily strong semimartingale consistent proof let e t for all t 0 1 and define t 1 t 1 for t 1 following similar steps to the proof of proposition 3 13 each coordinate of t 0 t 1 admits a decomposition i t a i t m i t where a i t t 0 s e i 1 f i s i s ds which is f i t adapted and m i t 0 t 1 is an f i t p martingale for i 1 n hence t 0 t 1 is weak semimartingale consistent from proposition 3 17 we also know that i t a i t m i t where a i t t 0 s e i 1 f s i s ds which is f t adapted and m i t 0 t 1 is an f t p martingale since t 0 t 1 is markov and using proposition 3 18 we know that e i 1 t is not necessarily equal to e i 1 i t hence a i t 0 t 1 is not necessarily f i t adapted also m i t 0 t 1 is not necessarily an f i t p martingale we used proposition 3 18 to prove proposition 3 20 we shall note another link between semi martingale consistency and markov consistency from 1 if a markov process xt t 0 satisfies the weak markov consistency with respect to its marginal x i t t 0 then xt t 0 is also strongly markov consistent with respect to x i t t 0 if and only if fx i t t 0 is p immersed in fxt t 0 here p immersion means that if x i t t 0 is an fx i t p local martingale then it is an fxt p local martingale as an opposite direction to p immersion we prove a result that links strong martingale consistency and strong markov consistency proposition 3 21 let st t 0 be a markov fst p martingale satisfying weak markov con sistency then st t 0 is strong semimartingale consistent if and only if it is strong markov consistent proof since st t 0 is an fst p martingale we have e s i t fsu s i u for 0 u t then if st t 0 is strong martingale consistent we have e s i t fsu e s i t fs i u s i u thus given that st t 0 is markovian satisfying weak markov consistency e s i t fsu r xp s i t dx fsu r xp s i t dx su e s i t fs i u r xp s i t dx fs i u r xp s i t dx s i u 9 for the opposite direction if st t 0 is strong markov consistent then since st t 0 is an fst p martingale satisfying weak markov consistency r xp s i t dx fsu e s i t fsu s i u r xp s i t dx s i u r xp s i t dx fs i u e s i t fs i u hence s i t t 0 is also an fs i t p martingale and the statement follows 4 examples we shall now study two examples of glps in more detail brownian liouville processes and poisson liouville processes 4 1 brownian liouville processes as a subclass of glps let us consider what we call brownian liouville processes blps in definition 3 1 we let lt 0 t un be a brownian random bridge given by lt t 1 m l 1 m wt t 1 m w 1 m 18 where 0 and wt 0 t un is a standard brownian motion independent of the random variable l 1 m for a background of the anticipative orthogonal representation given in 18 for a brow nian random bridge we refer the reader to 3 and 6 we also note that the gaussian process wt t 1 mw 1 m 0 t 1 m in 18 is a brownian bridge starting and ending at zero the following proposition is analogous to 16 proposition 3 10 for archimedean survival processes we denote the hadamard i e element wise product of vectors x y rn by x y we say t 0 t 1 is a standard brownian bridge if a it is a brownian bridge b 0 1 0 and c var t 1 t 2 proposition 4 1 if t 0 t 1 is a blp with the master process 18 then it admits the indepen dent brownian bridge representation t t m 1 m r 1 z m t 19 where m m 1 mn t is a vector of independent standard brownian bridges and the random vector z z 1 zn is multivariate gaussian with cov zi zj ijmi mimj 1 m proof for the proof we use wt and w t interchangeably we have i t l mit ui 1 l ui 1 mit 1 m l 1 m w mit ui 1 w ui 1 mit 1 m w 1 m mit 1 m r 1 mi i t t w ui w ui 1 mi 1 m w 1 m since r 1 l 1 m and where mi i t w mit ui 1 w ui 1 t w ui w ui 1 10 so i t 0 t 1 is a standard brownian bridge and is independent ofw ui w ui 1 andw 1 m it is straightforward to verify the independence by noting that they are jointly gaussian with nil covariation thus we can write i t t mi 1 m r 1 zi mi i t where zi is given by zi w ui w ui 1 mi 1 m w 1 m 20 and r 1 zi and i t 0 t 1 are mutually independent furthermore 1 t 0 t 1 n t 0 t 1 are mutually independent since they are jointly gaussian with nil covariation proposition 4 1 provides an anticipative orthogonal representation for blps whereas 15 provides a non anticipative semimartingale representation when t 0 t 1 is a blp remark 4 2 note that 1 z 0 from 20 and so its covariance matrix is singular also using 19 from proposition 4 1 rt 0 t 1 admits the anticipative representation rt 1 t t 1 m 1 m r 1 z 1 m t tr 1 1 m t where t 0 t 1 is a standard brownian bridge proposition 4 3 let 0 dx p 1 dx and t dx p 1 dx f t also let bt 0 t 1 be a vector of standard f t p brownian motions then if e 1 the multivariate measure valued process t 0 t 1 satisfies t dx 0 dx t 0 s dx s m dbs for 0 t 1 where each coordinate of t 0 t 1 is given by i t x i e i 1 t 2 mi 1 t proof see appendix remark 4 4 note that 1 b t 1 m bt gives the non anticipative semimartingale repre sentation for rt 0 t 1 which is rt t 0 e r 1 s rs 1 s ds n i 1 mib i t which provides the explicit example of the f t p martingale in 13 4 2 poisson liouville processes our second example are poisson liouville processes plps which are counting processes accord ingly in definition 3 1 we let lt 0 t un be a poisson random bridge with p lun i i for i n 0 proposition 4 5 let rt 0 t 1 be the intensity process of the l 1 norm process rt 0 t 1 if e r 1 then rt e r 1 t rt 1 t for 0 t 1 21 11 proof since rt 0 t 1 is a counting process we have rt limh 0 e rt h rt f t h since rt 0 t 1 is a markov process with respect to f t 0 t 1 using 14 we have rt lim h 0 e rt h t h rt h lim h 0 1 t h 1 t h 1 t he r 1 t 1 t h rt h e r 1 t 1 t lim h 0 rt 1 t h 1 t h 1 h e r 1 t 1 t lim h 0 rt h 1 t h which yields the result remark 4 6 when t 0 t 1 is a plp proposition 4 5 provides an alternative proof for propo sition 3 13 since rt 0 t 1 is a counting process proposition 4 7 let i t 0 t 1 be the intensity process of the coordinate i t 0 t 1 if e r 1 then i t mi 1 m rt for 0 t 1 proof fix 0 s t 1 from remark 3 9 we know that given s the increment t s has a generalised multivariate liouville distribution with generating law i st i rs for i n 0 and parameter vector m t s we define st i 0 i i i rs i st i rs e rt s rs t s 1 s e r 1 rs rs where the last equality comes from 14 then from 8 theorem 6 3 and 13 we have e i t s mi 1 m st i s since i t 0 t 1 is a counting process we have i t limh 0 e i t h i t f t h thus i t mi 1 m lim h 0 t t h h mi 1 m e r 1 rt rt 1 t the result then follows from 21 remark 4 8 note that rt i i t if we let pt 0 t 1 denote a poisson process and define by i pti pti 1 for some partition 0 t 0 t 1 tn we have p x ptn k k n i 1 pxii xi for x nn 0 with 1 x k 0 otherwise 12 where pi ti ti 1 tn in other words given ptn has a multinomial distribution let t 0 t 1 be a poisson liouville process with generating law k a k k n 0 then p 1 x a 1 x 1 x n i 1 pxii xi write g for the probability generating function of g z k 0 zka k let t i be the time of the first jump of the ith marginal process if i 1 1 then we set t i proposition 4 9 the random times t i i 1 n satisfy the following p t i s g 1 spi p t i g 1 pi p t i si i 1 n g 1 n i 1 pisi p t i i 1 n a 0 for s 0 1 and s 0 1 n proof see appendix g is increasing and invertible on 0 1 write x g 1 x and note that is invertible on 0 1 if ui 0 pi then we have p t i 1 ui pi ui it follows that the conditioned random variable pit i t i 1 is uniformly distributed furthermore p t i 1 ui pi i 1 n i 1 ui the form of the joint survival function oft t i i 1 n resembles that of an archimedean copula however the fact that p t i 1 0 means that it is not an archimedean copula 5 conclusion we introduced generalised liouville processes a broad and tractable class of multivariate stochas tic processes the class of glps generalises some processes that have already been studied we detailed various properties of glps and provided some new examples acknowledgements the authors are grateful to

that in 22 all the increments of type t s are vectors of non overlapping increments of the master lrb lt 0 t 1 m given r 1 l 1 m lt 0 t 1 m is a le vy bridge and so its law is invariant to a reordering of its non overlapping increments this is a direct result of the so called cyclical exchangeability property of le vy bridges see for example 7 the integrands in 23 can then be recognised as le vy bridge transition probabilities we now consider transitioning to 1 for all k 1 all 0 t 1 tk 1 all x 1 xk r n all y 1 yk 1 r and all b b r we have p 1 1 dy 1 n 1 1 dyn 1 n 1 b t 1 x 1 tk xk p

since t rt 0 t 1 is harmonic t rt 0 t 1 is an f t p martingale explicitly we have e p t rt f s ep f 1 m 1 t z rs rt rs f 1 m z dz s f 1 m 1 t z rs y f 1 m t s y dy dz f 1 m z f 1 m 1 s z rs f 1 m z dz s rs 15 for 0 s t 1 since 0 r 0 1 and t rt 0 t rt 0 t 1 is a radon nikodym density process we continue by verifying that under p the transition law of t 0 t 1 is that of a glp with generating law and

stationary increments property of lrbs and 2 dividing 30 by 31 concludes the second part 16 a 5 proposition 3 12 proof since t 0 t 1 is a markov process with respect to f t 0 t 1 rt 0 t 1 is a markov process with respect to f t 0 t 1 we first verify 11 the s conditional law of r 1 for s 0 trivially the law of r 1 is for 0 s 1 using 31 we have p r 1 dr s x p s dx r 1 r dz p s dx f 1 m 1 s r 1 x dr f 1 m r r f 1 m 1 s r 1 x dr f 1 m r as required next we verify 12 the s conditional law of rt for 0 s t 1 the process rt 0 t 1 is a p le vy process with p rt dr f 1 m t r dr where p is given by 10 using corollary 3 8 or 14 proposition 3 7 we have rt 0 t 1 a p lrb where p rt dr s x s r 1 ep t r 1 rt dr rs 1 x s r 1 r f 1 m 1 t z r f 1 m z dz f t s 1 m r 1 x dr as required a 6 proposition 3 15 proof conditional on d 0 d 1 the coordinates of t t d are independent le vy bridges and rt t d is a le vy bridge thus it is sufficient to prove that an integrable le vy bridge is a harness let xt 0 t 1 be a le vy process such that xt has a density ft for t 0 1 we shall show that the conditional process and le vy bridge xt x 1 k is a harness the conditions of the proposition allow us to assume that xt x 1 k is integrable we start by computing the following p ny i 1 xti dyi nx i 1 xai xi nz i 1 xdi zi x 1 k 32 for any nx ny nz n any 0 a 0 a 1 anx a t 1 tny d d 1 dnz 1 any x 1 xnx rnx any y 1 ynx

vy bridge between xa and xd define t 0 t d a by t xa t xa then t hxa d is le vy bridge from 0 to xd xa and e t hxa d t d a xd xa which yields the result a 7 proposition 4 3 proof define the mapping h r r 0 1 r r as follows h z y t m exp zy tz 2 2 m 2 1 t since the brownian bridges i t 0 t 1 i 1 n in 19 are mutually independent and t 0 t 1 is markov we have p 1 dx f t law n i 1 h x i i t t mi p 1 dx rn n i 1 h x i i t t mi p 1 dx exp n i x i i t t x i 2 2 2 mi 1 t p 1 dx rn exp n i x i i t t x i 2 2 2 mi 1 t p 1 dx 33 if we define the numerator of 33 as the function g i t i 1 n t dx exp n i x i i t t x i 2 2 2 mi 1 t p 1 dx 34 and apply ito s formula to 34 we get dg g t dt n i 1 g i t d i t 1 2 n i 1 2 g i t 2 d i t n i 6 j 2 g i t j t d i t j t g i t i 1 n t dx n i 1 x i i t 2 mi 1 t 2 dt n i 1 x i 2 mi 1 t d i t 18 where the covariation brackets i t j t for i 6 j disappear since the i t 0 t 1 i 1 n are mutually independent let g i t i 1 n t rn g i t i 1 n t dx then using fubini s theorem dg i t i 1 n t g i t i 1 n t n i 1 e i 1 t i t 2 mi 1 t 2 n i 1 e i 1 t 2 mi 1 t d i t the statement follows by applying ito s formula to the ratio 33 where we get d t dx t dx n i 1 x i e i 1

the proof of proposition 3 13 we can show that b i t 0 t 1 is continuous with quadratic variation t and is an f t p martingale then from le vy s characterisation bt 0 t 1 is a vector of standard f t p brownian motions a 8 proposition 4 9 proof let i t i 1 n 0 t 1 be the coordinates of the poisson liouville process t 0 t 1 the survival function of t i is p t i s p i s 0 e p i s 0 1 1 e 1 spi 1 1 g 1
