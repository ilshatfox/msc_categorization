eigenvalues of random networks with cycles pau vilimelis aceituno max planck institute for mathematics in the sciences max planck school of cognition leipzig germany aceituno mis mpg de abstract networks are often studied using the eigenvalues of their adjacency matrix a powerful mathematical tool with a wide range of applications since in real sys tems the exact graph structure is not known researchers resort to random graphs to obtain eigenvalue properties from known structural features however this theory is far from intuitive and often requires training of free probability cavity methods or a strong familiarity with probability theory in this note we offer a different perspective on this field by focusing on the cycles in a graph we use the so called method of moments to obtain relation between eigenvalues and cycle weights and then we obtain spectral properties of random graphs with cyclic motifs we use it to explore properties of the eigenvalues of adjacency matrices of graphs with short cycles and of circulant directed graphs although our result is not as powerful as the some of the existing methods they are nevertheless useful and far easier to understand 1 introduction networks and graphs are a very flexible modeling tool that has been crucial in studying complex systems of particular importance in those studies are the spectral methods a family of tools that use the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the graph 1 2 and which has been applied to fields as diverse as wireless communications 3 ecology 4 biological networks 5 image processing 6 machine learning 7 or nuclear physics 8 however in real world systems with many interacting elements the exact graph is not known and scientists must estimate those eigenvalues in order to use spectral methods hence researchers resort to spectral random matrix theory the mathematical field that studies the distribution of eigenvalues from a probabilistic perspective 9 however this approach requires a deep understanding of probability theory 10 or of statistical mechanics 11 and its results can be difficult to understand for non experts in our work is based so called method of moments used to prove winger s semicircle law 12 that has been extended to other families of symmetric matrices in an intuitive way 13 however we give an extra twist by giving it a graph theoretical 1 ar x iv 1 80 4 04 97 8 v 3 m at h s p 2 9 ja n 20 20 interpretation allowing us to go beyond the symmetric case and providing an intuitive approach to network spectra the rest of this paper is organized as follows first we explain the connection between cycles in a graph and the eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix then we use this connection to study the symmetries embedded in the spectra of random graphs with circular motifs and finally the spectral radius of directed circulant graphs 2 framework a directed graph g n e is a set of n nodes and e edges where every edge e n m represents a directed connection going from node n to node m each edge has an associated weight w e which represents the strength of that connection and might be negative the graph can be represented by its adjacency matrix m an n n matrix where every entry mnm is the weight of edge n m and non existent edges correspond to entries with value zero we define the normalized weight of the cycles of length l l 1 n c cl wc 1 where cl is the set of cycles of length l and wc e c w e the multiplication of weights of the edges e in cycle c note that this includes cycles where edges or nodes are visited multiple times as opposed to simple cycles where every node and edge can only be visited once since the value c cl wc is given by the entries of the power of the graphs adjacency matrix m 14 we can obtain l from the adjacency matrix m by the formula l 1 n tr ml 2 where tr is the trace operator the trace of a matrix equals the sum of its eigenvalues 15 therefore l can be written as l 1 n n n 1 l n 3 where n is the nth eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix m equation 3 is particularly interesting as n for this limit we can consider the eigenvalues of a matrix as random i i d values sampled from a probability density function p in the complex plane c for a random graph sampled from a probability distribution with a fixed l this value corresponds to a moment of the eigenvalue distribution l c p ld lim n 1 n n n 1 l n l 4 3 random networks with cyclic motifs many real world networks have an unexpectedly high number of network motifs small subgraphs that are overrepresented with respect to randomized networks 16 one of 2 the most relevant examples is the feedback loop a well known structure in control theory 17 which is equivalent to a directed cycle in a network this section shows how feedback loops shape graph spectra by studying graphs with abundant cyclic mo tifs we will consider sparse random graphs sampled from a distribution where all the connections between nodes have the same probability and with weights independently drawn from w w with equal probability in order to work on the limit n we will normalize the weights so that the variance of incoming and outgoing edge weights is one therefore w n e to account for the feedback motifs a fraction of the edges are embedded into cycles of length where the multiplication of the weights of edges in each cycle is either always positive or always negative corresponding respectively to positive or negative feedback as the number of nodes goes to infinity the values of l converge to their expecta tions and since only the cycles of length have non zero expectations lim n l wl fl n l 0 mod 0 otherwise 5 where cl is the number of cycles of length l that were added as feedback loops since l are the moments of p the previous equation says that the moments which are not multiples of tend to zero we will use this to study the symmetries in the eigenvalues but first we need to consider the rotated density function p e i the moments of this distribution can be computed through a simple change of variable l c p e i ld c p lel id el i c p ld el i l 6 then the moments of p and p e i are equal under the following conditions l l e l i l 0 2 l 4 l 2 l 1 l l 0 7 by using eq 5 in a large graph with abundant cycles of length l l l 0 2 4 8 and since the eigenvalues are bounded the equality of moments implies that p p e i so p p e i 9 for 0 2 2 1 in geometric terms this means that p has rotational symmetries in the complex plane since the entries of our adjacency matrix are real the eigenvalue distribution is also symmetric with respect to the real line combining this axis of symmetry with the rotational symmetries from eq 9 we obtain that p has axes of symmetry in the 3 complex plane all of them passing through the origin and with at angles 0 2 2 within the constraints of this symmetries we would still need to know how affects the eigenvalue distribution since the entries of our adjacency matrix are i i d and their magnitude decreases sub exponentially the probability distributions are uniform 18 within a closed curve this means that increasing decreases the surface in the angular range k 2 k while increasing it in 0 k intuitively 0 accounts for the number of cy cles and every cycle is a feedback loop therefore the linear system described by m has many cycles with positive feedback so it resonates at the frequency 1 and its corresponding harmonics this resonant frequency corresponds to the phases of the dominant eigenvalues meaning that when increases the eigenvalues with the phases 2 k for k 0 1 1 increase their moduli while those with phases 2 k 1 de crease it for 0 the argument is the same but the eigenvalues that are dampened are those with phases 2 k and the enhanced ones correspond to phases 2 k 1 we computed the eigenvalue distributions of large graphs with overrepresented cir cular motifs where degrees and weights are homogeneous the resultant eigenvalue distributions shown in fig 1 agree with our previous discussion in fact their support is given by the hypotrochoidic law of random matrices 19 which states that the support of the eigenvalues of such a matrix with a variance across columns normalized to 1 has the boundary z e i e i 1 10 where is an angle 1 0 1 real axis 1 5 1 0 5 0 0 5 1 1 5 im a g in a ry a x is l 2 d 20 d c 10 eigenvalues

with short cycles each plot shows the spectrum of a single random graph with cycles of length being overrepresented each blue point corresponds to one eigenvalue in the complex plane and the black lines correspond to the axis of symmetry that we investigated the graphs have 5000 nodes each with average degree of 20 the connections are assigned randomly and the weights can be either 1 d or 1 d with equal probability 4 circulant directed networks having studied the spectra of random graphs with short cycles we now investigate the effects of long cycles we turn to circulant graphs a well known class of graphs that 4 figure 2 circulant graph graphical representation of a directed circulant with graph ten nodes and degree two provided landmark results in graph theory 20 in our case we take their directed ver sion where every node with index n z nz and degree d is connected to its neighbors n 1 n 2 n d as shown in figure 4 for d 2 for simplicity we consider ran dom weights independently sampled from the set 1 1 with equal probability when n d this family of graphs contain only long cycles and is therefore well suited for our question the simplest case is given when d 1 since there is only a single simple cycle of length n k 0 for all k n and n n n 1 wn n 1 the solutions for those equations are the nth roots of n for n 1 n e 2 n n i n z nz 11 where i is the imaginary unit if n 0 the phase is shifted by n we computed the eigenvalues of large circulant directed networks our results are in fig 3 for d 1 our prediction matches the distribution when we increase d we find a surprising result for d 2 there is an outer ring and the rest of eigenvalues concentrate in a lemniscate shape and for d 2 the eigenvalues are concentrated on the real line and on d d 2 e rings centered at the origin to extend eq 11 to d 1 we start by studying the value of the largest eigenvalues by a combinatorial argument when we take eq 3 in the limit where l the eigenvalues with the largest modulus dominate the rest then l 1 n n k 1 l k max l 12 so l grows exponentially in l at the rate max we can use eq 1 to write l as a binomial distribution where cycle weights wc are independently sampled from 1 1 with equal probability then l can be approxi 5 1 0 5 0 0 5 1 real axis 1 0 8 0 6 0 4 0 2 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 im a g in a ry a x is degree 1 1 0 5 0 0 5 1 real axis 1 0 5

di rected circulant graph with 5000 nodes where the weights are randomly chosen to be 1 or 1 with equal probability each blue point corresponds to one eigenvalue in the complex plane mated by a normal distribution n 0 2 l with 2 l 1 n cl 13 where cl is the number of cycles of length l to obtain this value we consider the recurrence relation between paths in the circulant graph pl n m d k 1 pl 1 n m

distribution the expected value of the first order statistic has the order of magnitude of the standard deviation so l dl 16 by putting together eq 12 and eq 16 max d 17 6 eq 17 gives us the approximate position of the larger ring which agrees with the observed values see figure 4 we also observe empirically that the radii of the rings are distributed following the rule rd k 2 k 1 d 1 mod 2 2 k d 0 mod 2 18 where rd k is the radius of the kth ring in a circulant graph with degree d we compare our observation with the empirical data in figure 4 finding that the fit is quite good 0 5 10

distribution of eigenvalues for a circulant matrix with 5000 nodes and signs sampled at random see fig 3 every red rhombus is the radius given by eq 18 and the highest ones for every degree correspond to the radius given by eq 16 5 discussion in this paper we have argued that the structure of a graph can reveal information about its spectra by counting cycles and shown two examples of families of matrices where some properties of their eigenvalue distribution can be studied using this relationship although we restricted our examples to simple graphs we are confident that our frame work can be applied to more complicated weight distributions and more complex struc tural features we believe that the results presented here are easily translated into complex systems setting cycles are easy to understand and quantify eigenvalues are better suited to 7 study a systems stability and dynamics by establishing a link between both we provide a better insight into the relationship between both cases furthermore we also showed two beautiful families of eigenvalue distributions hopefully making random matrix theory more attractive by sheer aesthetics acknowledgement p v a is supported by the
