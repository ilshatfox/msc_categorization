print slightly shortened j stat phys 182 3 55 41 pp 2021 open access online since 06 march 2021 abstract we extend two rigorous results of aizenman lebowitz and ruelle in their pioneering paper of 1987 on the sherrington kirkpatrick spin glass model without external magnetic field to the quantum case with a transverse field of strength b more precisely if the gaussian disorder is weak in the sense that its standard deviation v 0 is smaller than the temperature 1 then the random free energy almost surely equals the annealed free energy in the macroscopic limit and there is no spin glass phase for any b v 0 the macroscopic annealed free energy times turns out to be non trivial and given for any v 0 by the global minimum of a certain functional of square integrable functions on the unit square according to a varadhan large deviation principle for v 1 we determine this minimum up to the order v 4 with the taylor coefficients explicitly given as functions of b and with a remainder not exceeding v 6 16 as a by product we prove that the so called static approximation to the minimization problem yields the wrong b dependence even to lowest order our main tool for dealing with the non commutativity of the spin operator components is a probabilistic representation of the boltzmann gibbs operator by a feynman kac path integral formula based on an independent collection of poisson

exhibiting at low temperatures a complex magnetic phase without spatial long range order in contrast to a ferro or antiferromag netic phase fh 91 m 93 n 01 to this day most theoretical studies of spin glasses are based on models which go back to the classic al sherrington kirkpatrick sk model sk 75 in this simplified model lenz ising spins are pairwise and multiplicatively cou pled to each other via independent and identically distributed gaussian random variables and are possibly subject to an external longitudinal magnetic field the sk model may be viewed as a generalization of the traditional curie weiss cw model in which the spin coupling is given by a single non random constant of a suitable sign in both models the pair interaction is of the somewhat unrealistic mean field type in the sense that it is the same for all spin pairs ns 03 this neglect of geometric distances requires the effective strength of the pair interaction to decrease sufficiently fast with increasing total number of the spins in order to ensure thermostatic behavior in the limit of macroscopically many of them the notion mean field indicates the comfortable fact that the bragg williams mean field approximation of equilibrium statistical mechanics h 87 yields the exact free energy in this limit fsv 80 according to standard textbook wisdom it is easy to calculate the macroscopic free energy of the cw model and to show that it provides a simplified but qualitatively correct description of the onset of ferromagnetism at low temperatures d 99 in contrast for the sk model the calculation has turned out to be much harder due to the in terplay between thermal and disorder fluctuations in particular for low temperatures never theless by an ingenious application of the heuristic replica approach see fh 91 m 93 n 01 parisi found that the macroscopic quenched free energy of the sk model is given by the global maximum of a rather complex functional of probabilistic distribution functions on the unit interval p 80 a p 80 b the unique maximizing distribution function is interpreted as the functional spin glass order parameter the attempt at understanding this parisi formula became a challenge to mathematical physicists and mathematicians t 98 highly gratifying for him and his intuition p 09 the formula was eventually confirmed by a math ematically rigorous proof due to the efforts and insights of guerra talagrand and others gt 02 g 03 ass 03 t 06 t 11 b p 13 ac 15 since magnetic properties cannot be explained at the sub microscopic level of atoms and molecules by classical physics alone some spin glasses require for fundamental and experimental reasons a quantum theoretical modelling of course the sk model may be viewed as a simplistic quantum model by interpreting the values of the ising spins as twice the eigenvalues of one and the same component of associated three component spin operators each of them with main quantum number 1 2 but a genuine quantum sk model with quantum fluctuations and inherent dynamics needs the presence of different non commuting components of the spin operators the theory of such a model was pio neered by bray and moore bm 80 and by sommers s 81 more precisely for a quan tum spin glass model with isotropic frenkel heisenberg dirac spin coupling of mean field type these authors handled the competition of thermal disorder and quan tum fluctuations by combining the dyson feynman time ordering of operator products with the replica approach bm 80 or with the thouless anderson palmer tap approach s 81 for the tap approach see fh 91 m 93 n 01 since these authors did not aim at rigorous results they applied the so called static approximation to simplify the rather complicated equations derived by them however this approximation is still insufficiently understood even for higher temperatures a simpler genuine quantum sk model is obtained by considering an extremely anisotro quantum spin glass model 3 pic pair interaction where only one component of the spins is coupled which is perpendicular to the direction of the external magnetic field this model was introduced by ishii and yamamoto iy 85 and approximately studied within the tap approach it is usually called the sk model with or in a transverse field see sic 13 and references therein it is this model to which we devote ourselves in the present paper it is characterized by the random energy operator or hamiltonian hn b 1 i n s x i v n 1 i j n gi js z i s z j 1 1 acting selfadjointly on the n spin hilbert space isometrically isomorphic to c 2 c 2 c 2 n c 2 n that is the n fold tensor product of the two dimensional complex hilbert space c 2 for a single spin here n 2 is the total number of a collection of three component spin 1 2 operators where the selfadjoint spin operator s i 2 with component and index or site i is given by the tensor product of n factors according to s i 1 1 s 1 1 x y z i 1 n in this definition the identity operator 1 and the operator s as the i th factor are understood to act a priori on c 2 and satisfy the specialized dirac identities s 2 1 sxsy isz sysz isx szsx isy 1 2 with i 1 denoting the imaginary unit with respect to the eigenbasis of sz these four operators are represented by the 2 2 unit matrix and the triple of 2 2 pauli matrices according to 1 1 0 0 1 sx 0 1 1 0 sy 0 i i 0 sz 1 0 0 1 the first term in 1 1 models an ideal quantum paramagnet and represents the energy of the spins due to their individual interactions with a constant magnetic field of strength b 0 externally applied along the positive x direction the second term in 1 1 models disorder in spin glasses and represents the energy of the spins due to random mean field type pair interactions of their z components more precisely we assume the n n 1 2 coupling coefficients gi j 1 i j n to form a collection of jointly gaussian random variables with mean e gi j 0 and covariance e gi jgkl ik jl in terms of the kronecker delta the parameter v 0 is the standard deviation of vgi j and stands for the strength of the disorder at given b or v quantum fluctuations become more important with increasing v or b respectively due to the non commutativity of sxi and s z i we proceed by introducing the basic thermostatic quantity of the model 1 1 for any reciprocal absolute temperature 0 we define the random partition function or sum as the trace zn tre hn 1 3 of the boltzmann gibbs operator and the specific gibbs free energy by fn 1 n ln zn 1 4 4 h leschke et al which is the random variable of main physical interest in particular in the macroscopic limit n the disorder average e fn of fn is called the mean or quenched free energy and has to be distinguished from the annealed free energy f ann n 1 n ln e zn 1 5 the latter is physically less relevant for spin glasses with frozen in disorder but math ematically more accessible and provides a lower bound on the quenched free energy by the concavity of the logarithm and the jensen inequality j 06 see also k 02 lem 3 5 f ann n e fn 1 6 over the years the work iy 85 has stimulated many further approximate and numerical studies devoted to the macroscopic quenched free energy of the quantum sk model 1 1 and the resulting phase diagram in the temperature field plane among them fs 86 yi 87 us 87 k 88 rcc 89 bu 90 a gl 90 bu 90 b mh 93 kk 02 t 07 y 17 mrc 18 not surprisingly this has led to partially conflicting results especially for low temperatures from a rigorous point of view a solid understanding of the low temperature regime seems still to be out of reach the main and modest aim of the present paper is there fore to provide the first rigorous explicit results for the opposite regime characterized by v 1 since in this regime b 0 may be arbitrary we call it the weak disorder regime in the following sections we firstly compile some properties of f annn for arbitrary v 0 next we show that f annn has a well defined macroscopic limit f ann with similar and well understood properties see theorem 3 1 theorem 4 3 and theorem 5 3 below in particular for v 1 the limit f ann takes a rather explicit form as a function of v and b then we prove that the more important free energies fn and e fn have both f ann as its almost sure macroscopic limit if v 1 see theorem 6 3 and corollary 6 6 for v 1 we also prove the absence of spin glass order in the sense that limn sz 1 sz 2 2 0 almost surely see corollary 6 4 and remark 6 5 here en fn tre hn denotes the random gibbs expectation induced by hn these results extend two of the pioneering results of aizen man lebowitz and ruelle alr 87 for the model 1 1 with b 0 to the quantum case b 0 unfortunately for any v 1 we only have the somewhat weak result that the difference between the macroscopic quenched and annealed free energies is strictly positive if the ratio b v is sufficiently small to our knowledge the only other rigorous results for the quantum sk model 1 1 are due to crawford c 07 and to adhikari and brennecke ab 20 crawford has extended key results of guerra and toninelli gt 02 and carmona and hu ch 06 for the model 1 1 with b 0 to the quantum case b 0 more precisely he has proved the existence of the macroscopic quenched free energy not only for v 1 but for all v 0 without a formula furthermore he has shown that the limit is the same for ran dom variables gi j 1 i j n which are not necessarily gaussian but merely independently and identically distributed with e g 12 0 e g 12 2 1 and e g 12 3 more re cently adhikari and brennecke have provided a variational formula for the macro scopic quenched free energy for all v 0 this formula is still somewhat implicit and given by a suitable d limit of a parisi like functional for a classical d component vector spin glass model due to panchenko quantum spin glass model 5 2 the annealed free energy and its deviation from the quenched free energy in this section we attend to the annealed free energy f annn for arbitrary values of n 2 v 0 and b 0 according to 1 5 we have to perform the gaussian disorder av erage of the partition function zn in order to do so explicitly we will use the following poisson feynman kac pfk probabilistic representation of zn in terms of n copies of a poisson process with constant rate or intensity parameter b zn cosh b n s exp 1 0 dt hn s t b 2 1 here the classical hamiltonian hn characterizing the zero field sk model sk 75 is defined by hn s v n 1 i j n gi jsis j 2 2 where s s 1 sn 1 1 1 1 1 1 n denotes one of the 2 n classical spin configurations and the notation s indicates summation over all of them the integrand in 2 1 is obtained from 2 2 by replacing there each si by the product si i t where i t 1 n i t t 0 i 1 n 2 3 defines the spin flip process with index i in other words a semi random telegraph signal k 74 kr 13 it is a continuous time homogeneous pure jump type two state markov pro cess k 02 ch 12 steered by a simple poisson process ni in the positive half line the random variable ni t is n 0 valued and poisson distributed with mean b t 0 indepen dent of the index i the n poisson processes n 1 nn are assumed to be stochastically mutually independent the angular brackets b denote the corresponding joint pois son expectation conditional on i 1 1 for all i 1 n in 2 1 and in the following we often write t 1 t n t and suppress the n dependence of b to keep the notation simple for the validity of the pfk representation 2 1 we refer to b 16 in appendix b for performing the gaussian disorder average of the partition function zn we start out with the disorder mean e hn s 0 2 4 and the disorder covariance e 2 hn s hn s 2 n qn s s 2 1 2 5 of the classical hamiltonian in terms of the dimensionless disorder parameter 2 v 2 4 and the overlap qn s s 1 n n i 1 sis i s s 1 1 n 2 6 between two classical spin configurations formula 2 1 then gives e zn 2 cosh b n e zn b 2 7 for a concise definition of poisson point processes well suited for our purposes the reader may consult appendix a 6 h leschke et al here the functional zn 7 zn is a random variable with respect to the underlying n poisson processes and defined by zn e 2 n s e exp 1 0 dt hn s t 2 8 e 2 n s exp 1 2 e 1 0 dt hn s t 2 2 9 exp n 1 0 dt 1 0 dt qn t t 2 2 10 exp n pn 2 11 equation 2 9 reflects the gaussianity of the disorder average with 2 4 interchanging now the expectation with the two fold time integration according to the fubini tonelli theorem using 2 5 and observing si 2 1 yields 2 10 by 0 qn s s 2 1 the two fold integral pn is a 0 1 valued random variable so that we have the crude estimates 1 zn en 2 12 somewhat to our surprise we have not succeeded in calculating f annn explicitly not even for n see however theorem 4 3 and theorem 5 3 below for the time being we derive certain estimates and properties of f annn for the formulation of the corresponding theorem we introduce some notation we begin with the function 0 1 0 1 0 1 defined by t t i t i t b cosh b 1 2 t t cosh b 1 cosh b 2 13 for all i 1 n it is the thermal duhamel kubo auto correlation function of the z component of a single spin in the absence of disorder 0 see b 13 in appendix b upon explicit integrations we get 1 0 dt 1 0 dt t t 1 0 dt t 0 tanh b b m 2 14 and 1 0 dt 1 0 dt t t 2 1 0 dt t 0 2 1 tanh b 2 m 2 p 2 15 so that 2 p m 1 cosh b finally we introduce two positive sequences by pn p 1 p n gn ln 1 pn e n 1 n 1 2 16 lemma 2 1 inequalities between m and p and bounds on gn for any n 2 b 0 and 0 we have the inequalities 0 m 2 p m min 1 2 p 2 p 1 p m 2 17 pn ln 1 pn e 1 gn n pn 1 pn n 2 2 2 18 max 0 ln pn n gn n 2 19 quantum spin glass model 7 proof the first five inequalities in 2 17 are obvious the last one is a consequence of the elementary inequalities sinh x x x 3 6 and tanh x x x 3 3 for x 0 the first in equality in 2 18 follows from the convexity of the exponential and the jensen inequality for a 0 1 valued bernoulli random variable taking the success value 1 with proba bility pn 0 1 for the second inequality we use 1 pn e 1 n 1 pn en 1 exp gn by the convexity of the n th power x 7 xn for x 0 and the jensen inequality the last inequality is an application of ln 1 a ex 1 a x 1 a x 2 2 a 0 1 x r 2 20 for a pn and x n inequality 2 20 itself follows from x x exp x 1 x x 2 2 and ln y y 1 for y 0 the inequalities 2 19 are simple consequences of pn 1 now we are prepared to present our first result theorem 2 2 on the annealed free energy a for any value of the dimensionless disorder parameter 2 v 2 4 0 and any number of spins n 2 we have the three estimates gn n n f annn ln 2 cosh b p n 1 n 2 21 f annn n 1 n ln 2 2 22 b the dimensionless quantity f annn depends on the disorder strength v only via the vari able 0 the function 7 f annn is concave is not increasing and has the following weak and strong disorder limits lim 0 1 f annn ln 2 cosh b p n 1 n 2 23 lim 1 f annn n 1 n 2 24 c the function 7 f annn is concave for any v 0 proof a the claimed inequalities 2 21 are equivalent to n pn fn gn 2 25 where fn n f annn n ln 2 cosh b 2 26 ln exp n pn b 2 27 confer 1 5 2 7 and 2 11 by an explicit calculation using 2 13 and 2 15 we obtain pn b pn 2 28 consequently the lower estimate in 2 25 follows from the convexity of the exponential and the jensen inequality with respect to the poisson expectation in 2 27 to obtain the upper estimate in 2 25 we recall from 2 12 that pn 0 1 therefore we have exp n pn b 1 pn b en 1 2 29 8 h leschke et al by the jensen inequality eya 1 a ey 1 for y r and a 0 1 used al ready in the proof of the first inequality in 2 18 and by taking the poisson expecta tion estimate 2 22 follows from the disorder average of the inequality zn b v zn 0 v limb 0 zn b v for the random trace zn zn b v for later refer ence we prove this probabilistically and estimate the poisson expectation in 2 1 from below by restricting it to the single realization without any spin flip that is without any jump in the time interval 0 1 this realization occurs if and only if the random variable n i 1 1 i defined by 1 i 1 if i t 1 for all t 0 1 and 1 i 0 otherwise takes its maximum value 1 the probability of this event is n i 1 1 i b n i 1 1 i b 1 1 b n cosh b n 2 30 b the first sentence is obvious by 2 27 this equation also shows that f annn is concave in because the right hand side of 2 27 is convex by the ho lder inequality the monotonicity in then follows from the concavity and f annn ln 2 cosh b for all 0 by 2 21 with obvious equality in the limiting case 0 the claim 2 23 follows from 2 21 and lim 0 gn n pn see 2 18 the claim 2 24 follows from 2 22 and the lower estimate in 2 21 by using lim gn n 1 see 2 19 c this concavity follows from definition 1 5 by the ho lder inequality with respect to the product measure e tr remark 2 3 i equation 2 30 shows that the classical limit b 0 corresponds to taking into account only the single realization without any spin flip for each spin ii the last inequality in 2 19 weakens the lower estimate in 2 21 to n this weaker lower estimate is quasi classical in the sense of lemma 2 5 below it may also be derived from using the jensen inequality exp 1 0 dt 1 0 dt exp in the pfk representation 2 1 or from applying the golden thompson inequality di rectly to the trace 1 3 the inequality zn b v zn 0 v underlying the esti mate 2 22 may also be derived directly from 1 3 by applying the jensen peierls bogolyubov inequality for such trace inequalities we refer to s 05 iii the parameter p on both sides of 2 21 is actually a bijective function of the prod uct b 0 see 2 15 it is strictly decreasing approaches its extreme values 1 and 0 in the limiting cases b 0 and b respectively and attains the value 1 2 at b 1 19967 more precisely at the solution of b tanh b 1 see figure 2 1 in the first limiting case the estimates 2 21 yield the well known result for the zero field sk model given by the right hand side of 2 22 they also guarantee that f annn coin cides with the free energy of the ideal paramagnet in the absence of disorder 0 in the opposite limit of extremely strong disorder the result 2 24 shows that the magnetic field becomes irrelevant in agreement with the zero field sk model and physical intuition for the case b v iv the lower estimate in 2 21 may be sharpened by replacing gn with the less explicit bound g n 1 0 dt ln r dxwn x cosh 4 x t 0 sinh 4 x n 2 31 where wn x n exp nx 2 defines the centered gaussian probability den sity on the real line r with variance 1 2 n in fact we have the two inequalities fn g n gn for their proofs we note that the quantity ln exp kn b as a quantum spin glass model 9 0 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 0 0 5 1 0 p b fig 2 1 plot of the parameter p defined in 2 15 as a function of b see re mark 2 3 iii functional of r valued poisson random variables kn 7 kn is convex by the ho lder inequality the first inequality now follows from 2 26 2 27 the jensen inequality applied to the two fold integration in 2 11 a gaussian linearization using wn and an explicit calculation confer the proof of lemma 6 1 below the first step in the proof of the second inequality is the same as in the proof of the first inequality but then instead of performing the gaussian linearization we use 2 29 with pn replaced by qn t t 2 combine this with 2 28 and finally apply again the jensen inequality to the two fold integration but this time using the concavity of the logarithm we note that g n like gn for any n 2 may be viewed to depend on b only via p because the function b 7 p is bijective v the upper estimate in 2 21 may be sharpened considerably by combining 2 26 with 4 27 below as n this becomes optimal for any according to theorem 4 3 a vi in the simple case n 2 the quenched and annealed free energies can be calculated exactly by determining the four eigenvalues of the two spin hamiltonian h 2 with the results e f 2 1 2 e ln 2 cosh 2 b 2 2 g 2 12 2 cosh 2 g 12 2 32 f ann 2 1 2 ln e 2 cosh 2 b 2 2 g 2 12 2 e 2 33 for the remaining gaussian integrations over the real line there are explicit closed form expressions available only in the limiting cases b 0 and or 0 the basis for our somewhat weak result mentioned near the end of section 1 is theorem 2 4 on the difference between the quenched and annealed free energies a for any 0 we have the crude bounds 0 e fn f annn gn n n n 1 n 2 34 b for any 0 we also have the lower bound k n ln cosh b e fn f annn 2 35 where k max q 0 1 1 1 q 2 e ln cosh g 12 4 q 2 36 10 h leschke et al c a simple condition implying strict positivity of the lower bound in 2 35 is bmin b 2 1 n 1 n 8 2 37 the proof of theorem 2 4 given below is based on the lower estimate in 2 21 the estimate 2 22 certain quasi classical estimates for the random free energy fn fn b v divided by the temperature and on the so called replica symmetric sk approximation k ln 2 to the macroscopic quenched free energy of the zero field sk model sk 75 this approximation provides a lower bound one fn 0 v for all v and n 2 according to guerra see g 01 ineq 5 7 g 03 and also t 11 a thm 1 3 7 since the quasi classical estimates are of some independent interest we firstly compile them in lemma 2 5 quasi classical estimates for the free energy fn 0 v fn b v ln cosh b fn 0 pv ln 2 2 38 0 fn 0 v fn b v ln cosh b bmin b 2 1 2 39 proof lemma 2 5 the first estimate in 2 38 follows from using the jensen inequality exp 1 0 dt 1 0 dt exp in the pfk representation 2 1 alternatively it may be viewed as an application of the golden thompson inequality confer remark 2 3 ii using in 2 1 the jensen inequality exp b exp b combined with 2 13 and 2 15 yields the second estimate in 2 38 the last estimate in 2 38 is due to the operator inequality exp hn 1 hn and trhn 0 for arbitrary b and v the first two estimates in 2 39 follow by combining the first estimate in 2 38 with the random version underlying 2 22 see its proof and also remark 2 3 ii the last estimate in 2 39 is due to the elementary inequalities cosh y exp min y 2 2 y for y r here the second inequality is obvious and the first one follows by comparing the two associated taylor series termwise and using n 2 n 2 n for n n remark 2 6 i the estimates 2 38 are quasi classical because the quantum fluctuations lurking behind the anti commutativity szi s x i sxi szi equivalently behind the random ness of the poisson process ni are neglected by the first estimate and taken somewhat into account by the second one in terms of an effective disorder parameter pv v the last estimate in 2 38 corresponds to the limiting cases v 0 and b the es timates 2 39 control in a simple way the influence of the transverse magnetic field on the values attainable by the free energy ii the estimates 2 38 imply especially fn ln 2 cosh b 0 this estimate can be derived without fn 0 pv directly from 2 1 by using exp y 1 y for y r and s hn s t 0 alternatively it may be viewed as an application of the jensen peierls bogolyubov inequality similarly as in remark 2 3 ii proof theorem 2 4 a the first bound in 2 34 is 1 6 for the second bound in 2 34 we take the disorder average of the second estimate in 2 38 and combine the result with the lower estimate in 2 21 this gives e fn f annn gn n n e fn 0 pv ln 2 2 40 quantum spin glass model 11 finally we use the disorder average of the last crude estimate in 2 38 e fn 0 pv ln 2 2 41 the simplified last bound in 2 34 is due to 2 19 b we begin by claiming the lower estimate e fn k ln 2 cosh b 2 42 it simply follows by combining the disorder average of the second estimate in 2 39 with guerra s lower bound on e fn 0 v that is with 2 42 for b 0 the claim 2 35 now follows by combining 2 42 with 2 22 c we have k e ln cosh g 12 4 8 here the first inequality follows from restricting the maximization in 2 36 to q 1 the second inequality follows from ln cosh y y for y g 12 4 combined with e g 12 2 the last estimate in 2 39 now completes the proof remark 2 7 i the upper bound in 2 34 has an underlying random version namely fn f annn gn n it simply follows by combining the lower estimate in 2 21 with the estimate in remark 2 6 ii ii we recall some more or less well known properties of the function k 7 k first we have the bounds max 0 8 k the lower bound 0 follows from restricting the maximization in 2 36 to q 0 the other lower bound has just been derived in the proof of theorem 2 4 c and the upper bound follows from using cosh y 1 in 2 36 second we have the equivalence 4 1 k 0 it follows by considering the first two derivatives with respect to q of the function to be maximized in 2 36 these can be studied via gaussian integration by parts third for 4 1 the function k is strictly increasing according to its first derivative k q 2 0 where q is the unique strictly positive solution of q e tanh g 12 4 q 2 some times called the zero field sk equation iii obviously any sharpening of 2 41 or 2 42 improves the bound in 2 34 or 2 35 respectively 3 the topics of section 2 in the macroscopic limit from now on we are mainly interested in the macroscopic limit n the next theorem is the main result of this section and analogous to theorem 2 2 theorem 3 1 on the macroscopic annealed free energy a for any 0 the macroscopic limit of the annealed free energy exists is given by f ann lim n f ann n sup n 2 f ann n n 3 1 and obeys the three estimates inf n 2 gn n f ann ln 2 cosh b p 3 2 f ann ln 2 3 3 12 h leschke et al b the dimensionless limit f ann depends on the disorder strength v only via the dimension less variable 0 the function 7 f ann is concave is not increasing and has the following weak and strong disorder limits lim 0 1 f ann ln 2 cosh b p 3 4 lim 1 f ann 1 3 5 c the difference between the macroscopic annealed free energy and the ideal paramag netic free energy vanishes for any v 0 in the high field limit according to lim b f ann ln 2 cosh b 0 3 6 d the function 7 f ann is concave for any v 0 remark 3 2 i for the lower estimate in 3 2 lemma 2 1 implies the bounds p ln 1 p e 1 inf n 2 gn n gm m 3 7 p 1 p 2 2 1 p m 2 m 2 3 8 max 0 ln p 2 inf n 2 gn n gm m lim n gn n 3 9 for any 0 b 0 and natural number m 2 another upper bound is inf n 2 gn n ln 1 3 2 pe 2 2 3 10 which follows from 3 9 by choosing m 2 p and observing p 1 it is smaller than if and only if p 2 3 1 e 2 ii the infimum over m 2 in 3 8 is attained and depends on the smaller is the larger is the minimizing m in particular if 1 3 then and only then the minimizing m is larger than 2 iii returning to infn 2 gn n itself the minimizing n 2 depends on and via p also on b in the weak and strong disorder limits we have lim 0 g p lim g 1 3 11 for g infn 2 gn n the strong disorder limit is obvious from 3 9 for the proof of the weak disorder limit we use 3 8 to obtain limsup 0 g p 1 p m pm taking now the infimum over m 2 and observing p g from 3 7 completes the proof of 3 11 for intermediate values of in the sense that 2 ln 1 2 p equivalently g 4 4 g 2 2 the infimum in 3 2 is attained at some n 3 a numerical approach suggests that the minimizer is n 2 for all 1 if b 1 2 in this context we recall from 2 25 the inequality f 2 g 2 for all and b and from 2 33 and 2 26 that f 2 can be calculated exactly however while f 2 2 provides a sharper lower bound in 3 2 than g 2 2 it is a less explicit function of and b quantum spin glass model 13 proof theorem 3 1 a for the proof of 3 1 we show that the sequence fn n 2 as defined in 2 26 is sub additive indeed for two arbitrary natural numbers n 1 n 2 2 and classical spin config urations s s 1 1 n 1 n 2 we have qn 1 n 2 s s 2 n 1 n 1 n 2 1 n 1 n 1 i 1 sis i 2 n 2 n 1 n 2 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 i n 1 1 sis i 2 3 12 by the convexity of the square and the jensen inequality by combining this with 2 27 2 10 and 2 6 and by using the independence of the involved poisson processes we get the claimed sub additivity fn 1 n 2 fn 1 fn 2 according to fekete f 23 see also k 02 lem 10 21 this establishes the convergence result lim n fn n inf n 2 fn n p 0 3 13 where we have used also 2 25 and 2 16 by 2 26 this gives the claim 3 1 the estimates 3 2 and 3 3 follow from 3 1 applied to 2 21 and 2 22 respectively b the first sentence follows from 3 1 and the corresponding one in theorem 2 2 b the function 7 f ann is concave and not increasing because it is the pointwise limit of a family of such functions according to 3 1 and theorem 2 2 b the claim 3 4 follows from 3 2 and 3 11 the claim 3 5 follows from 3 3 the lower estimate in 3 2 and 3 11 c this follows from 3 2 3 10 and lim b p 0 d the function 7 f ann is concave because it is the pointwise limit of a family of such functions according to 3 1 and theorem 2 2 c remark 3 3 i the lower estimate in 3 2 becomes sharpened for intermediate values of when gn is replaced by g n this is a consequence of remark 2 3 iv ii the high field relation 3 6 complements the strong disorder relation 3 5 a relation analogous to 3 6 also holds for the macroscopic quenched free energy limn e fn this follows by combining 3 6 with 1 6 and the disorder average of the estimate in remark 2 6 ii in the limit n here we rely on the fact that limn e fn exists for all 0 for the classical limit b 0 this has been shown by guerra and toninelli in their seminal paper gt 02 its extension to the quantum case b 0 is due to craw ford c 07 by building on gt 03 for 1 4 this extension also follows from our main result limn e fn f annn 0 obtained by probabilistic arguments in theorem 6 3 below returning to the high field relation for the macroscopic quenched free energy we note that it is consistent with the inequality lim n e fn min ln 2 cosh b lim n e fn 0 v 3 14 following from the disorder averages of 2 38 and 2 39 for any b 0 equality in 3 14 for given v 0 only holds in the limiting cases b 0 and b as follows from 2 38 and the strict concavity of limn e fn in b r this contrasts the quantum random energy model qrem for which equality holds in the analog of 3 14 for all b and v according to goldschmidt in g 90 although the qrem is much simpler than the quantum sk model 1 1 a rigorous proof of his statement was achieved only recently by manai and warzel in mw 20 14 h leschke et al iii in the limit n the bounds in theorem 2 4 take the form max 0 k ln cosh b inf n 2 gn n 3 15 the upper bound in 3 15 is due to the disorder average of 2 38 and the lower estimate in 3 2 at the expense of weakening this bound for intermediate values of it can be made somewhat more explicit with the help of 3 8 and 3 9 or 3 10 for small and large respectively in any case by 3 7 the upper bound in 3 15 is not sharp enough to vanish for 1 4 but it vanishes for any 0 in the high field limit b due to 3 10 iv according to the monotonicity mentioned in remark 2 7 ii the lower bound in 3 15 is strictly positive for sufficiently large 1 4 in particular if bmin b 2 1 8 see 2 37 it follows from 3 15 that the difference 0 between the macroscopic quenched and annealed free energies is strictly positive for any pair b 0 0 provided that v 0 is sufficiently large physically more important is the situation of a fixed v 0 then strict positivity holds for any b 0 provided that 0 is sufficiently large and conversely for any 1 v provided that b 0 is sufficiently small nevertheless the lower bound in 3 15 is not sharp enough to characterize the maximum region with 0 in the 1 b plane for b 0 but it is so for b 0 the latter can be seen by combining the main result in alr 87 or theorem 6 3 with 2 42 for b 0 and the equivalence in remark 2 7 ii these facts are illustrated in figure 3 1 where we also have included the result of theorem 6 3 and a cartoon of the critical line that is the border line between the spin glass and the paramagnetic phase as obtained by approximate arguments and or numerical methods for example in fs 86 yi 87 us 87 gl 90 t 07 y 17 mrc 18 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 1 2 0 1 2 1 v b v 0 0 spin glass paramagnet fig 3 1 in the temperature field quarter plane there is one region where the difference limn e fn f annn 0 is strictly positive light gray according to 3 15 and another one where it is zero heavy gray according to theorem 6 3 the red dashed line is a cartoon of the critical line between the spin glass and the paramagnetic phase as obtained by approximate arguments and or numerical methods see remark 3 3 iv the region with 0 is larger than the light gray region but we do not know how large it should at least contain the critical line the region characterized by 0 is larger than the region implied by 3 15 for example for 1 v 1 4 ln 2 0 60056 there is a region where the annealed entropy 2 f ann is nega tive as follows from theorem 3 1 d the lower estimate in 3 2 and 3 3 this region does not completely belong to the region implied by 3 15 quantum spin glass model 15 v for any b 0 the lower bound in 3 15 is good enough to coincide with the upper one for asymptotically large in the sense that lim 1 it follows from 3 11 and lim k 1 according to the simple bounds in remark 2 7 ii com bining this observation with 3 5 yields lim limn e fn 0 reflecting the finiteness of the specific macroscopic quenched ground state energy which in its turn directly follows from 2 42 and remark 2 7 ii finally we note that the lower bound in 3 15 also implies lim in agreement with 3 3 4 a dual pair of variational formulas for the macroscopic annealed free energy in the last section we have seen that the macroscopic annealed free energy f ann exists and obeys explicitly given lower and upper bounds which become sharp in the limits of weak and strong disorder 0 and respectively furthermore the bounds in 3 2 coincide asymptotically also in the limits of low and high field that is b 0 and b however so far we have no formula which makes the dependence of f ann more transparent for general 0 and b 0 this will be achieved to some extent in the present section more precisely we will show that f ann may be viewed as the global minimum of a non linear functional with a simple dependence and defined on the hilbert space of real valued functions being square integrable over the unit square this follows from an asymptotic evaluation of the right hand side of 2 27 as n by large deviation techniques due to varadhan v 66 and others see ds 89 dz 10 and also k 02 for the formulation of the corresponding theorem we need some preparations we begin by introducing some further notation we consider the separable real hilbert space l 2 l 2 0 1 0 1 l 2 0 1 l 2 0 1 of all lebesgue square integrable functions 0 1 0 1 r t t 7 t t with scalar product 1 0 dt 1 0 dt t t t t and norm 1 2 for l 2 if l 2 then obviously its absolute value also belongs to l 2 where t t t t for almost all t t 0 1 0 1 with respect to the two dimensional lebesgue measure the tensor product i j of two random functions 2 3 is defined pointwise by i j t t i t j t so that i j l 2 obviously in particular we consider the sequence i i i 1 of independent and identically distributed l 2 valued random variables and its empirical or sample aver ages n n i 1 i i n with mean n b and variance 2 n b 2 1 2 n for all n n finally we introduce the non linear functional l 2 r 7 generating the cumulants or logarithmic moments of 1 1 1 by ln exp 1 b 4 1 and its legendre fenchel transform l 2 r 7 by sup l 2 4 2 with its effective domain d l 2 we stress that and d depend on b 0 equivalently on p but we suppress this dependence to simplify the notation as we have done with m and p introduced in 2 13 2 14 and 2 15 lemma 4 1 some properties of the functionals and for any l 2 with l 2 as defined in 2 13 and with 1 l 2 denoting the constant unit function we have 16 h leschke et al a for the inequalites 1 4 3 1 ln cosh b 4 4 b for the equality and inequalities 0 1 ln cosh b 4 5 moreover we have the properties c the functional is convex which is reflected by the inequalities 4 6 here the non linear mapping l 2 l 2 7 is defined by the l 2 function e e 1 1 b 1 b 1 4 7 this function is in its argument t t continuous and exchange symmetric t t more over for 0 pointwise it satisfies the equality and inequalities 0 0 4 8 0 p m 1 1 0 4 9 d the functional is lipschitz continuous with constant 1 1 4 10 and also weakly sequentially continuous that is sequentially continuous with respect to the weak topology on l 2 furthermore the functional has at any l 2 the linear and continuous ga teaux differential l 2 r 7 because d da a a 0 a r 4 11 e the mapping is lipschitz continuous with constant 1 4 12 f the finiteness equivalently d implies 1 0 1 and 0 for all l 2 0 1 in particular 0 g the functional is convex and so is its non empty set d furthermore is weakly lower semi continuous and its lower level sets d r l 2 r for r 0 are non empty convex weakly sequentially compact and weakly compact quantum spin glass model 17 proof a the first and last inequality in 4 3 are obvious the second one is the jensen inequality combined with 2 13 the fourth one follows from 1 1 and the fifth one is the schwarz inequality the third inequality follows from the taylor series of the exponential in 4 1 by estimating termwise according to 1 n b 1 n b for n n this estimate is due to and the positivity implied by the inequalities k i 1 tk b ti t j k i i j 1 tk b 0 4 13 they are proved within a more general setting in appendix a see a 6 here t 1 t 2 n denote 2 n arbitrary points of the time interval 0 1 and i j denote two arbitrary elements of the index set i 1 2 n for the proof of 4 4 we restrict the poisson expecta tion in definition 4 1 to the single realization without any spin flip in 0 1 by inserting 1 1 confer the proof of 2 22 by this we get 1 ln 1 1 b 1 ln cosh b b by definitions 4 2 and 4 1 we have 0 0 0 for all in particular 0 on the other hand 4 2 also gives 0 by from 4 3 the second inequality in 4 5 follows from using 4 4 in 4 2 c the functional is convex by the ho lder inequality the first inequality in 4 6 follows from the jensen inequality with respect to the expectation b and the fubini tonelli theorem the second inequality then follows from interchanging and the exchange symmetry t t of the function t t 7 t t 1 t t b 1 t 1 t b is obvious the proof of the continuity of this func tion is postponed until the proof of d the estimate in 4 7 is due to the triangle inequality b b combined with 1 1 it ensures that l 2 the pointwise equality in 4 8 is obvious the inequality there follows from the taylor series of the exponential under the expectation in 4 7 and using 4 13 with n 1 instead of n the inequalities 4 9 are immediate consequences of the estimates 0 1 see 4 7 and 4 8 and the definitions 2 14 and 2 15 d inequality 4 10 follows from 4 6 and the inequality in 4 7 moreover for any se quence n n 1 l 2 weakly converging to some l 2 we have a supn 1 n as a consequence of the banach steinhaus theorem see bc 17 lem 2 46 and lem 2 22 therefore we get 1 limn n 1 and n 1 n a for all realizations of the underlying poisson process n 1 the claimed weak sequen tial continuity limn n now follows from the lebesgue dominated convergence theorem with respect to the poisson expectation for the proof of the global ga teaux differentiability we replace in 4 6 by a with a 0 and get a a a the proof of 4 11 is now completed by observing that lima 0 a for all l 2 the latter follows from 4 7 4 10 and by dominated convergence with respect to the poisson expectation and to the integration underlying the scalar product of l 2 for the postponed proof of the continuity of t t 7 t t 1 t t exp 1 b for given l 2 we apply the schwarz inequality to the poisson expectation and obtain for the time being t u t u t t 2 2 e 2 1 1 t u t u 1 t t b 4 14 the last poisson expectation with t t 0 1 and t u t u 0 1 is bounded from below by t u t t u t according to 4 13 with n 2 thus the left hand 18 h leschke et al side of 4 14 tends to zero for all t t 0 1 as u u tends to 0 0 this implies the continuity of the l 2 function exp on the unit square e the claimed inequality 4 12 is equivalent to l 2 4 15 in fact 4 12 follows from 4 15 for conversely 4 15 follows from 4 12 by the schwarz inequality for the proof of 4 15 we write 1 0 da d da a 1 0 da d da 1 a 4 16 using the a expectation a b a see 4 7 the integrand turns out to be the a covariance of the centered random variables a 1 1 a and b 1 1 a and has an a independent upper bound according to d da 1 a ab a a 2 a b 2 a 1 2 4 17 here the first estimate is the schwarz inequality with respect to a for the second estimate we use b 2 a 1 2 a 1 a 2 2 which follows from the positivity of squared real numbers the schwarz inequality for the scalar product and 1 1 we also use a 2 a 2 which follows analogously f for the first claim we use 1 from 4 3 in 4 2 to obtain 1 now we pick an arbitrary 0 and apply the last inequality to a function l 2 satisfying the lower estimate 1 on some borel measurable set b 0 1 0 1 of strictly positive lebesgue area b b 1 0 where b denotes the indicator function of b for such a we choose a b l 2 with a 0 and get a 1 b a 1 b 0 taking the supremum over a 0 gives which is equivalent to the first claim for the second claim we restrict the supremum in 4 2 to a 1 with a 0 and obtain a 1 if 1 0 since the 0 1 valued random variable 1 1 1 0 dt 1 t 2 has the strictly positive variance 2 1 2 m p b 2 2 1 m 2 b 2 the supremum over a 0 gives which is equivalent to the second claim for the third claim we note that a 0 by 4 1 and 1 0 by 4 2 we therefore get a for all l 2 taking the supremum over a 0 gives if 0 this is equivalent to the third claim g the functional has the claimed two properties because it is by definition 4 2 the pointwise supremum of a family of affine and weakly continuous functionals see bc 17 prop 13 13 the sets d and d r are convex because is convex and they are not empty because d 0 d r d since d is contained in the closed unit ball b 1 l 2 1 by the previous claim f it is bounded consequently every sequence in d r is bounded and therefore has a sub sequence n n 1 weakly converging to some b 1 see bc 17 lem 2 45 since liminfn n r by the weak sequential lower semi continuity of we actually have d r in words d r is weakly sequentially closed to conclude d r is weakly sequentially compact and hence by the s mulian eberlein equivalence also weakly compact see bc 17 cor 2 38 since the unit ball b 1 is closed with respect to the l 2 norm and also convex by the convexity of that norm it is also weakly closed see bc 17 thm 3 34 and weakly sequentially compact bc 17 cor 2 38 quantum spin glass model 19 remark 4 2 i the fourth inequality in 4 3 may be sharpened in a b dependent way according to ln cosh sinh 1 1 4 18 the first inequality follows from the convexity of and the jensen inequality applied to the two fold integration underlying the l 2 scalar product the second inequality is due to 1 ii since is weakly sequentially continuous it is in particular weakly sequentially lower semi continuous w s l s c by its convexity is therefore even weakly lower semi continuous see bc 17 thm 9 1 iii since the ga teaux differential 7 in lemma 4 1 d is linear and con tinuous is even the fre chet derivative or gradient of at see bc 17 fact 2 62 iv the inequalities 4 6 imply monotonicity of in the sense that 0 in fact this monotonicity is even equivalent to the convexity of see bc 17 prop 17 7 v we also have a pointwise monotonicity of in the sense that 0 if 0 this is a consequence of 0 here the first inequality is obvious by 0 the second one follows from 4 8 and the third one is 4 6 vi we only have the inequalities 0 1 1 and 0 m instead of 4 9 for general not necessarily positive l 2 the first positivity follows from 0 1 0 dt 1 t 2 1 1 1 1 1 the proof of the second positivity contains an ad ditional argument according to 0 d 2 1 0 dt 1 t 2 t 2 d 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 b 1 here we are using d 2 b as another no tation for the partial expectation with respect to the poisson process steering the spin flip process 2 eventually we are prepared to present the main result of this section theorem 4 3 dual variational formulas for the macroscopic annealed free energy a for any 0 the limit f ann of the dimensionless annealed free energy satisfies the following two equivalent variational formulas f ann ln 2 cosh b inf d 4 19 inf l 2 1 4 4 20 b the infimum in 4 19 and the infimum in 4 20 are attained and each global minimizer d l 2 in 4 19 at given b 0 corresponds to a minimizer l 2 in 4 20 and vice versa through the relation 2 in 4 20 and hence in 4 19 one may restrict the infimization to positive and exchange symmetric l 2 without losing generality c each minimizer l 2 in 4 20 is a continuous and exchange symmetric function solving the euler lagrange critical equation 2 4 21 and obeying the pointwise bounds 2 2 1 so that 2 p 2 corresponding properties hold for the minimizer in 4 19 by b 20 h leschke et al d for any 1 2 there exists only one solution of 4 21 and hence by c only one minimizer in 4 20 and hence by b only one minimizer in 4 19 proof a at first we note that the infimum in 4 19 is lower bounded by as follows from 0 and 1 for d see lemma 4 1 f by 4 19 and 3 9 this lower bound may be recognized as a weakened version of the one in 3 2 from this lemma and remark 4 2 ii we also recall that is convex and weakly lower semi continuous two properties which are well known to be shared by the l 2 norm and its square due to the schwarz and the jensen inequality the equality 4 20 there fore easily follows from legendre fenchel duality see t 79 thm 2 2 or bc 17 cor 14 20 the proof of 4 19 requires more work we begin by rewriting 2 27 as fn ln exp n n n b n 2 4 22 using 2 11 2 6 and the empirical averages n introduced above lemma 4 1 in view of 2 26 and 3 1 we need to show that lim n fn n sup d 4 23 to this end we observe that the sequence n n 1 satisfies a large deviation princi ple ldp with convex good rate functional with respect to the weak topology on l 2 equivalently this ldp is satisfied by the sequence of borel probability mea sures dn n 1 on l 2 where dn is the distribution of n characterized by its lap lace functional 7 l 2 dn d exp exp n n on l 2 this fol lows from lemma 4 1 and ds 89 thm 3 3 11 or dz 10 sec 6 1 that given the varadhan integral lemma dz 10 thm 4 3 1 see also k 02 thm 27 10 as an extension of the classic asymptotic method of laplace then yields limn fn n sup b 1 here we have used the norm continuity of the squared norm 7 2 and the fact that the measure dn is supported on the closed unit ball b 1 l 2 because n 1 since for all b 1 d the desired equality 4 23 follows b at first we show that the infimum i inf l 2 in 4 20 is attained here 1 4 2 l 2 0 4 24 defines the underlying non linear functional l 2 r we will use two properties of by from 4 3 we have 4 4 so that is super coercive that is lim furthermore we claim that is w s l s c in the sense of remark 4 2 ii because it is the sum of two functionals with this property for the first functional the squared norm this is well known namely if n n 1 l 2 converges weakly to l 2 then we get 2 liminfn n 2 from the obvious inequality 2 n 2 2 2 2 n the second functional is w s l s c because is even weakly sequentially continuous by lemma 4 1 d now we choose an arbitrary sequence j j 1 l 2 infimizing in the sense that lim j j i since the converging sequence j j 1 is bounded the norm and weak topologies on l 2 induce the same borel sigma algebra of events e 77 this functional ldp is one natural extension fromrd to l 2 valued random variables of the pioneering refinement of the weak law of large numbers due to crame r 1938 and h chernoff 1952 quantum spin glass model 21 the coerciveness of implies the same for the underlying sequence j j 1 see bc 17 prop 11 20 therefore this has at least one sub sequence n n 1 n j n weakly converging to some limit in l 2 see bc 17 lem 2 45 we name this unknown limit use the fact that is w s l s c and conclude by a well known beautiful argument going back to bolzano and weierstrass confer for example bb 92 i liminf n n limsup j j lim j j i 4 25 to summarize each weak accumulation point of any infimizing sequence is a minimizer the other claims about the minimizers follow from the simplicity of the squared norm 2 and from the finiteness convexity weak sequential continuity and ga teaux differentiability of according to t 79 sec 2 1 or by extending an argument in the proof of cet 05 thm a 1 from the euclidean rd to the real hilbertian l 2 one may restrict to positive in 4 20 because and by 4 3 one may restrict to exchange symmetric because and here t t t t t t 2 defines the exchange symmet ric part of c at first we assert the two inequalities 2 1 4 2 4 26 here l 2 is arbitrary is an arbitrary minimizer of and 2 1 is the fre chet gradient of at both inequalities follow from the second inequality in 4 6 rewritten as 2 2 2 4 to obtain the first inequality in 4 26 we take the supremum over for a minimizing this then yields 2 0 hence a solution of 4 21 the claimed continuity and exchange symmetry just reflect the corresponding properties of for any l 2 according to lemma 4 1 c the claimed bounds follow from 4 21 combined with 4 7 and 4 8 the second inequality in 4 26 will be used only later in the proof of theorem 5 3 in the next section it follows from the above rewritten inequality in 4 6 with by using the just obtained 0 and renaming to d for two solutions l 2 of 4 21 we have 2 2 by 4 12 it follows that 1 2 if 6 this implication is equivalent to the claim remark 4 4 i as to the proof of 4 23 it is interesting to notice that the inequality fn n sup l 2 1 4 sup d n 2 4 27 can be derived easily without large deviation techniques one only has to use in 4 22 the obvious inequality n n 2 n for arbitrary l 2 combined with properties of the exponential the definition 4 1 and the fact that the random variables 1 1 n n are independent and identically distributed the equality in 4 27 is 4 20 ii from 4 19 and 4 20 we immediately rediscover that f ann depends on v only via 0 and that f ann is not increasing in because it is the pointwise infimum of a fam ily of such functions since inf l 2 inf l 2 2 by scaling the concavity of f ann in is seen to follow similarly from the convexity of from 22 h leschke et al 4 19 and 4 20 also the upper estimates in 3 2 and 3 3 can easily be rediscov ered namely the upper estimate in 3 2 follows from 4 19 by restricting to the single function and from 4 20 by using see 4 3 the estimate 3 3 follows from 4 19 or 4 20 by restricting to the constant function 1 or 2 1 and by observing 4 5 or 4 4 respectively the lower estimate in 3 2 does not seem to be obtainable so easily from 4 19 or 4 20 however the weaker lower estimate see 3 9 immediately follows from 4 19 according to the beginning of the proof of theorem 4 3 a alternatively it follows from 4 20 by see 4 3 iii the lipschitz continuity 4 12 implies 2 by the schwarz inequality applying this to 4 24 yields 1 2 1 2 4 28 and hence strict monotonicity of equivalently bc 17 prop 17 7 strict convexity of on l 2 if 2 1 this shows again without referring to the critical equation 4 21 that has exactly one minimizer for 2 1 iv the variational formula 4 20 may be derived informally and without referring to 4 19 from rewriting 4 22 as follows fn ln wn d exp n 4 4 29 here we have interchanged the poisson expectation with the linearizing integration over the generalized sample paths 0 1 0 1 t t 7 t t of centered two time gaussian white noise with generalized covariance wn d t t u u t u t u 2 n in terms of the dirac delta the symbolic equation wn d d exp n for the gaussian probability measure wn in 4 29 suggests the laplace method for the asymptotic evaluation as n the resulting variational formula then turns into 4 20 by the replacement 7 4 in the physics litera ture such a derivation often goes under the name hubbard stratonovich trick or transformation in particular when a dyson feynman time ordered exponential or product integral instead of the pfk representation 2 1 is employed in order to dis entangle non commuting hilbert space operators see for example m 75 bm 80 s 81 kk 02 for a rigorous approach to feynman s disentangling formalism we refer to the monograph jl 00 v upon dividing by the functional 4 24 in 4 20 may be viewed as a simple landau ginzburg wilson free energy h 87 obtained by integration over the paths 1 t 7 1 t of a single spin flip process in the sense of 2 3 1 1 ln exp h 1 1 b 4 30 here the effective hamiltonian h 1 1 associates to any l 2 and any 1 a non instantaneous self interaction energy by h 1 1 4 1 1 the corresponding effective gibbs expectation is given by b see 4 7 the critical equation 0 see 4 21 combined with 4 7 then identifies the positive self interaction function self consistently up to a factor 2 with the perturbed auto correlation function of the spin 1 1 b 1 1 b the combination of theorem 4 3 and theorem 6 3 below therefore constitutes for 4 1 a rigorous the ory of the self consistency equations in the respective physics literature among them quantum spin glass model 23 fs 86 yi 87 us 87 gl 90 mh 93 in this literature the condition 1 1 2 is some times used to determine the critical line between the paramagnetic and the spin glass phase in the temperature field plane see for example us 87 by the pointwise in equalities 2 2 1 from theorem 4 3 c this condition implies 1 4 1 m which indicates the absence of spin glass order for 4 1 in agreement with corol lary 6 4 below see also section 7 in this connection we mention that the parameter m defined in 2 14 may be recognized as the zero field single spin or local z z susceptibility for 0 5 the macroscopic annealed free energy for weak disorder unfortunately we do not know explicitly a single minimizer in 4 19 or 4 20 if 0 in this section we therefore compare the global minimum f ann ln 2 cosh b see theorem 4 3 b to its simple upper bound 2 that is to the functional 4 24 evaluated at 2 fortunately it turns out that 2 not only shares with the properties of convexity and monotonicity in but also constitutes a very good approx imation to for small more precisely their respective asymptotic expansions as 0 coincide up to the second order the corresponding second order coefficient turns out to be a rather complicated function of b 0 taking only negative values larger than 0 14 see figure 5 1 below the main drawback of 2 is the fact that it does not yield the true behavior of for large however due to our main result theorem 6 3 in the next section it is presently only the weak disorder regime 4 1 for which is known to be physically relevant we begin with lemma 5 1 some properties of the upper bound 2 the function 7 2 p 2 a is concave and strictly decreasing b obeys for any 0 the estimates p ln 1 p m e 2 m 1 2 p 5 1 2 m p 2 2 m p ln cosh b 5 2 c has the second order taylor formula 2 p 2 c 0 2 4 3 r 3 5 3 with the variance c 0 1 2 b p 2 m p 4 b 2 2 p m 6 2 p m 2 2 5 4 and some continuous function r 0 m 3 m 3 7 r d has the strong disorder limit lim 1 2 2 m p 5 5 in the limiting case 0 we simply have 0 see 4 5 and therefore 0 0 0 coincidence up to the first order follows already by an argument in remark 4 4 ii 24 h leschke et al proof a the concavity follows from the convexity of the strict monotonicity follows from concavity and the fact that the first derivative at 0 equals p 0 b in terms of the 0 m valued random variable q 1 see remark 4 2 vi we have e 2 1 e 2 m q m 1 q m e 2 m 1 5 6 by the elementary jensen inequality used in the proof of the first inequality in 2 18 taking now the poisson expectation and the logarithm gives an upper bound on 2 which in turn yields the lower estimate in 5 1 the upper estimate in 5 1 is 2 2 p from 4 3 the lower estimate in 5 2 follows from weakening that in 5 1 by us ing p m 1 the upper estimate in 5 2 follows from 4 4 c we use the expectation b 2 see 4 7 since q 0 m the convex function 7 2 ln e 2 q 0 is arbitrarily often differentiable and its second order taylor formula at 0 with remainder in lagrange form affirms that for each 0 there exists some unknown number a 0 1 such that 2 2 q 0 2 2 2 q q 0 2 0 2 3 3 r 5 7 with the third cumulant r q q a 3 a m 3 m 3 the claim now follows from q 0 p and an explicit calculation of q 2 0 the latter is based on 2 13 a 7 in appendix a for 1 t 1 1 t 2 1 t 3 1 t 4 0 and a straightforward but somewhat te dious integration over the four dimensional unit cube 0 1 4 d the limit 5 5 follows from 5 2 remark 5 2 i since the explicit expression 5 4 for the variance c 0 is rather compli cated we mention its simple bounds according to m p 2 cosh b c 0 m p p 5 8 in the notation of the proof of lemma 5 1 the lower bound follows from c 0 q p 2 0 q p 21 1 0 m p 2 1 1 0 confer the proof of 2 22 the upper bound simply follows from q 2 qq mq the lower bound implies the expected strict positivity of c 0 for b 0 the upper bound shows that c 0 vanishes only in the limiting cases b 0 and b and is smaller than p 4 as a function of b the variance c 0 is continuous and attains its maximum value 0 0695 at b 0 9089 according to a simple numerical computation see figure 5 1 for small b we have the asymptotic expansion c 0 4 5 b 2 13 36 b 4 as b 0 ii the rather explicit lower estimate in 5 1 shares with 2 the properties of con cavity and monotonicity it also has the same leading asymptotic behaviors in the limits of small and large and b but the second order coefficient of its small taylor series is already smaller and given by 2 m p p confer 5 3 and 5 8 neverthe less the positive difference between 2 and the lower estimate in 5 1 does not exceed 2 m p min m 1 for all this follows from 5 1 combined with 2 20 respectively with p m 1 iii obviously 5 5 does not reflect the true strong disorder limit 3 5 of because 2 m p m 2 p 1 but by generalizing 2 to the one parameter variational ex pression minx 0 1 2 x 1 2 this limit may be included for x 1

a function of b see remark 5 2 i the next theorem shows that 2 is a very good approximation to the global minimum f ann ln 2 cosh b for small see theorem 4 3 b and 4 24 theorem 5 3 the macroscopic annealed free energy up to second order in we have the following error estimates 0 2 4 3 0 5 9 and the two term asymptotic expansion for weak disorder f ann ln 2 cosh b p 2 c 0 2 o 3 0 5 10 with c 0 given by 5 4 and the usual understanding of the landau big oh notation that o 3 stands for some function of with limsup 0 o 3 3 proof the first inequality in 5 9 is obvious because is a minimizer of for the second inequality we observe 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 by 4 8 theorem 4 3 c and 4 12 using this estimate in the second inequality of 4 26 yields 5 9 combining 5 9 with 5 3 yields 5 10 remark 5 4 i the first two terms on the right hand side of 5 10 reflect the concavity and monotonicity of in both of the positive coefficients p and c 0 vanish in the limit b in agreement with 3 6 and 5 1 recall also remark 3 3 ii ii the estimates 5 9 can be sharpened according to 2 2 2 min 4 3 inf n 2 gn n p 5 11 the lower estimate in 5 11 follows from the lower estimate in 4 26 and is strictly positive because 2 is not a minimizer of for 0 the second upper estimate in 5 11 follows from the lower estimate in 3 2 and the upper estimate in 5 1 for given 0 it sharpens the one in 5 9 for sufficiently small and sufficiently large b see remark 3 2 i we also have the simplified relative error estimates 2 2 2 min 4 2 p 1 p 5 12 the lower and the first upper estimate follow by combining 5 11 with the estimates p infn 2 gn n from 3 2 and remark 3 2 i the second upper estimate follows from writing the relative error as 2 1 and using again 2 p as well as 26 h leschke et al iii in view of 4 21 combined with 4 12 the unique minimizer of for 2 1 may be determined numerically with arbitrary precision by the successive approximations n 1 2 n 1 2 n n 5 13 the norm convergence of this minimizing sequence is exponentially fast according to n 2 n 1 1 2 n 2 n 1 5 14 here the first inequality follows from 4 12 by mathematical induction for the next inequalities see the proof of theorem 5 3 using n in 4 26 combined with 5 14 yields an approximation to the macroscopic annealed free energy with an error not exceeding 2 2 n 1 2 for n 1 we get back to 5 9 iv by theorem 5 3 we know that 1 coincides with up to the order 2 as 0 by 5 14 we see that 2 coincides with the minimizer up to the same or der therefore it is of interest to determine 2 up to that order to this end we recall that for each non zero l 2 the mapping 7 defines a positive rank one operator on l 2 which we denote by following dirac the poisson average e 1 1 b of the projection 1 1 is a positive integral operator with a contin uous 0 1 valued kernel given by 1 t t 1 u u b for t t u u 0 1 0 1 by an extension of 5 7 we now have 2 2 2 2 2 e o 3 5 15 for any l 2 with the derivative 2 2 e o 2 5 16 hence we arrive at 2 2 2 2 2 2 e p 1 2 o 2 o 3 5 17 with 1 denoting the identity operator on l 2 like the first order term in 5 17 also the second order term is a continuous exchange symmetric and positive l 2 function in agreement with theorem 4 3 c the first two properties are directly inherited from the integral kernel of the operator e the positivity follows from the pointwise inequality e for all 0 due to 4 13 the function e can be calculated explicitly by 5 4 we have in particular e c 0 p 2 further properties of e are given by the operator inequalities 0 e 1 and the equality tre 1 for its trace consequently the uniform norm of the operator difference a e 0 obeys a tra 1 p sometimes variational problems in function spaces like 4 20 are drastically simplified by restricting the set of all allowed variational functions to the one parameter subset of func tions of the form y 1 where 1 is the constant unit function in l 2 for the present case and y r is arbitrary this is often called for an obvious reason the static approximation confer for example bm 80 s 81 yi 87 us 87 kk 02 t 07 in view of lemma 5 1 and theo rem 5 3 it is not surprising that this approximation in the present case does not yield the true this is of course consistent with the banach fixed point theorem quantum spin glass model 27 behavior for small not even up to the first order in as opposed to that 2 1 has the same strong disorder limit as which however does not reflect the true behavior of the macroscopic quenched free energy in this limit the main properties of the static approximation to the macroscopic annealed free energy are compiled in corollary 5 5 on the static approximation and its insufficiency for weak disorder let the restriction of the infimization in 4 20 to the one dimensional subspace of all con stant l 2 functions be denoted as j inf x r 2 x 1 inf x r x 2 2 x 1 5 18 then the function 7 j a is concave and not increasing b obeys for any 0 the three estimates inf n 2 gn n j m 2 5 19 j ln cosh b 5 20 c obeys for any r 2 1 m with arbitrary r 0 1 the lower estimate m 2 1 r j 5 21 d has the weak and strong disorder limits lim 0 j m 2 lim j 1 5 22 proof a the claim holds because it is true for any function defined by an arbitrary restric tion of the infimization in 4 20 confer remark 4 4 ii more explicitly j is concave because it is the pointwise infimum of a family of such functions according to the con vexity of and similarly j is not increasing because it is the pointwise infimum of a family of such functions according to j infy r y 2 4 y 1 b the lower estimate in 5 19 is obvious from infn 2 gn n j the upper estimate in 5 19 follows by restricting to x m in 5 18 and using from 4 3 estimate 5 20 follows by restricting to x 1 and using 4 4 c in terms of the 0 1 valued random variable q 1 0 dt 1 t 2 we have y 1 1 yq and by an analogy to 5 6 therefore y 1 ln 1 m ey 1 m y 1 m y 2 2 5 23 for all y r the second inequality follows from 2 20 this gives y 2 4 y 1 1 2 1 m y 2 4 m y 1 r y 2 4 m y 5 24 the proof of 5 21 is completed by completing the square in 5 24 and dividing by 4 d the strong disorder limit follows from 5 20 the lower estimate in 5 19 and 3 11 for the weak disorder limit we start from m 2 r 1 liminf 0 j by 5 21 take the supremum over r 0 1 and observe the upper estimate in 5 19 28 h leschke et al remark 5 6 i the small estimate 5 21 is not only useful for the proof of the weak disorder limit in 5 22 which differs from the true limit in 5 10 since m 2 p but it also implies that j is strictly larger than the minimum in 4 20 for suf ficiently small 0 more precisely by choosing r 1 m 2 p we get from 3 2 4 20 with 4 19 and 5 21 that f ann ln 2 cosh b p j 5 25 for all p m 2 2 p 1 m m p 2 p 1 2 this upper bound on is a continuous and strictly increasing function of b 0 and approaches its extreme values 0 and 1 2 in the limiting cases b 0 and b respectively it attains the value 1 4 approximately at b 3 on the other hand the true strong disorder limit in 5 22 implies that j p for sufficiently large ii our proof of corollary 5 5 is based on rather crude estimates of y 1 that easily follow from its definition additional information on j for intermediate values of may be obtained from the formula y 1 ln r dze z 2 cosh b 2 4 yz 2 cosh b y 0 5 26 it follows from a gaussian linearization and a consequence of the pfk formula see remark b 2 iii in appendix b the restriction to y 0 in 5 26 causes no problem because one may restrict to x 0 in 5 18 without losing generality this follows from in 4 3 iii for related models without disorder one may restrict to constant variational functions without losing generality as has been shown in d 09 ccil 08 in particular for the quantum cw model defined by 1 1 with non random gi j 1 n this observation provides one but not the simplest rigorous approach to its well known macroscopic free energy and to the equation tanh b b v of its critical line bmt 66 s 86 6 the macroscopic free energy and absence of spin glass order for weak disorder in this section we are going to prove that for weak disorder more precisely for any 4 2 v 2 in the open unit interval 0 1 and any b 0 the free energy fn coincides almost surely with the annealed free energy f annn in the macroscopic limit n we begin by comparing the first and the second moment of the partition function with respect to the gaussian disorder average by the positivity of general variances we know that e zn 2 e zn 2 in the present case of 1 1 we also have e zn 2 c e zn 2 with c e 2 1 4 1 6 1 provided that 4 1 this is a special case of the following lemma which in its turn is an extension of t 11 b lem 11 2 3 for the zero field sk model to the present quantum case with a transverse field for its formulation we recall definition 2

the joint gibbs expectation corresponding to the duplicated quantum sk model with hilbert space c 2 n c 2 n and hamiltonian defined as the sum of hn 1 see 1 1 and a copy 1 hn thereof with spin

with the unitary operator un exp i 2 n n 1 s x n isx n on c 2 n lemma 6 1 controlling a generalized second moment of zn by its first moment for any n 2 0 and a 0 with 4 a 1 we have e zn 2 exp 2 n a 1

integrations according to the fubini tonelli theorem in a first step we observe the following identity for the gaussian disorder average e 4 e exp 1 0 dt hn s t hn s t zn zn exp 2 n rn 6 6 here we have used 2 4 2 5 2 10 and 2 8 the left hand side lhs of 6 5 can therefore be written as lhs e 4 cosh b 2 n zn zn s s exp 2 na rn b 6 7 in a second step we use the jensen inequality exp 2 na rn 1 0 dt

by the crude inequalities cosh y n exp n y exp ny exp ny for y r the last integral is seen to be bounded from above by 2 exp 2 na for arbitrary a 0 if 4 a 1 then it even has the n independent upper bound 1 1 4 a as claimed in 6 5 it is due to the inequality cosh y exp y 2 2 mentioned at the end of the proof of lemma 2 5 remark 6 2 for the zero field sk model equality holds in 6 8 and hence in 6

5 see 6 7 and or 6 8 the special case a 1 see 6 1 is the main ingredient for the proof of the next theorem this theorem and its two corollaries extend two of the pioneering results of aizenman

of n and n 0 with n 0 as n such that the probability of finding the right hand side of 6 16 to be smaller than n is larger than this then yields n n and hence limn n 0 in fact with an initially arbitrary energy 0 we estimate as follows 1 4 c 2 exp 2 2 v 2 p fn f annn ln 2 n p fn e fn n 1 6 17 p fn f annn ln 2 n and fn e fn n 6 18 p fn f annn fn e fn ln 2 n n 6 19 here 6 17 is due to 6 15 with x zn and q 1 2 combined with 6 1 and due to the large deviation estimate c 2 in appendix c using n 1 n and replacing by n for 6 18 we have used the inclusion exclusion formula for two sets events and the fact that probabilities do not exceed the value 1 inequality 6 19 is just the monotonicity of prob ability measures finally we choose so large that 1 4 c 2 exp 2 2 v 2 0 and put n ln 2 n n theorem 6 3 has two important consequences corollary 6 4 absence of spin glass order for weak disorder if 4 1 then we have lim n e sz 1 sz 2 2 0 6 20 proof by applying the jensen inequality to the

6 3 32 h leschke et al remark 6 5 following alr 87 see also ps 91 wb 04 the left hand side of 6 20 is the mean of the spin glass order parameter in the macroscopic limit because the pre limit e sz 1

corollary 6 4 also the variance e qn e qn 2 of qn is seen to vanish as n since qn e qn 1 the dominated convergence theorem establishes thep almost sure relation limn qn 0 that is the self averaging property of the sequence qn n 2 in particular the distribution of qn converges weakly to the dirac distribution at 0 r as n if 4 1 confer b 96 thm 5 1 in the physics literature this asymptotic

until now the model 1 1 seems to be the only quantum mean field spin glass model for which the second limit is known to exist for arbitrary 0 this is due to crawford c 07 theorem 6 3 above provides for 4 1 a variational formula for the limit and therefore its existence for the weak disorder regime as a by product similarly as in alr 87 for the case b 0 in view of the complexity of the parisi formula p 80 a p 80 b d 81 t 06 p 09 t 11 b p 13 ac 15 even for vanishing longitudinal field we conjecture a more complicated variational formula to hold for 4 1 and b 0 the last three references also contain results for classical sk models with multi spin interactions quantum spin glass model 33 7 concluding remarks and open problems the present paper contains the first rigorous explicit results on the thermostatics of the quan tum sherrington kirkpatrick spin glass model 1 1 for the regime v 1 unfor tunately the opposite and more important regime remains not nearly as well understood as in the classical limit b 0 at least from a rigorous point of view over the 35 years of research several investigators have provided stimulating and possibly correct results by ap proximate arguments and or numerical methods but for low temperatures these results are typically less reliable for example due to the unjustified interchange of various limits and or because of too small lie trotter numbers therefore one should find rigorous argu ments for the actual shape of the red dashed line in figure 3 1 in view of remark 4 4 v it is tempting to conjecture that the assertions 6 14 6 20 and 6 26 remain true under the b dependent condition v 1 m this would enlarge the heavy gray region in figure 3 1 slightly beyond the vertical line v 1 and help to localize the critical line somewhat further in any case the precise determination of this line is a demanding problem a similar challenge is to aspire after the analog of the parisi formula for the macroscopic quenched free energy of the quantum sk model 1 1 a first step in this direction has been achieved recently by adhikari and brennecke ab 20 see the end of section 1 at present we do not know how their variational formula reduces to our 4 19 if v 1 unfortunately for v 1 we only have the inequalities 2 38 which may be used to bound the free energy of 1 1 from below and above in terms of the zero field parisi formula nevertheless it could be that the quantum analog of the parisi formula is in certain respects simpler than the classical one because of quantum fluctuations confer rcc 89 bu 90 b mrc 18 a the positivity of certain poisson process covariances for the proofs of 2 13 4 13 and related facts it is convenient to consider poisson point processes being more general than the one used in the main text see for example k 02 lp 18 k 93 a poisson process in a general sigma finite measure space a is a random measure on a the distribution of is uniquely defined in terms of the positive measure by the elegant and powerful formula exp dx f x exp dx 1 e f x a 1 for its laplace functional which dates back to campbell c 09 here and in appendix b the angular brackets denote the expectation with respect to the probability measure steering the randomness of and f 0 is an arbitrary measurable function into the positive half line for f a a with a 0 a a and a the right hand side of a 1 equals the laplace transform of the poisson distri bution with mean a hence the random variable a is n 0 valued and poisson distributed with mean a a in words the mean number of poisson points lying in a equals its measure by choosing f m j 1 a j a j it also follows from a 1 that the random variables a 1 am are independent for pairwise disjoint sets a 1 am a of finite measures for all m n finally we note that a 1 remains valid when f is replaced by the imaginary function i f with f r obeying dx min f x 1 in the main text we are mainly interested in 1 1 valued random variables corresponding to a 1 a with a a obeying a by choosing f i mj 1 a j with an arbitrary collection of m n such sets a a 1 am a we get from a 1 a exp dx 1 a x a 2 in terms of the 1 1 valued products a mj 1 a j and a m j 1 1 2 a j in particular we have a j exp 2 a j by choosing ak 0 for all k 6 j if b b 1 bn a is another arbitrary collection of n n such sets we obtain the positive covariance a b a b a 3 34 h leschke et al by a 2 the pointwise inequality a b a b 1 and the functional equation of the exponential a simple consequence of a 3 by iteration is a m j 1 a j exp 2 m j 1 a j 0 a 4 as in the main text we are going to introduce a conditional poisson expectation for a fixed with a and we write the two kronecker deltas 1 as 1 1 2 the poisson expectation conditional on 1 equivalently on even can therefore be written as 1 1 1 e 2 a 5 by a 5 and a 3 we immediately see that a a the conditional analog of a 3 is lemma a 1 a b a b a 6 proof from a 2 and a 5 we get the conditional analog of a 2 a cosh i a cosh exp dx 1 a x a 7 with i a dx a x corresponding formulas hold for b and a b in the latter case a has to be replaced with the product a b and i a with i a b dx 1 a x b x for the proof of a 6 we firstly employ again the above inequality a b a b 1 then it remains to show that cosh cosh i a b cosh i a cosh i b to this end we use the hyperbolic re lation 2 cosh cosh i a b cosh i a b cosh i a b therefore the two inequalities i a b i a i b based on the pointwise equalities 1 a b a b and the triangle inequality combined with the relation cosh y cosh y for y r complete the proof remark a 2 i if a j for all j then the exponential factor in a 7 takes its maximum value 1 for example in the case of two such sets say a and b we simply have a b cosh 2 a 2 b 4 a b cosh a 8 the numerator further simplifies to cosh 2 a b if a b or b a ii in the main text and in appendix b we only consider the special case corresponding to 0 a b 0 borel sigma algebra in 0 b lebesgue measure and 0 1 there we write n t and t 1 n t 1 n t instead of 0 t and 0 t respectively for any t 0 we also write b instead of 0 1 it is well known that the stochastic pro cess n t t 0 has independent and in distribution time homogeneous increments n t u n u t t u for u 0 this implies that it is a markov process more precisely a continuous time homogeneous markov chain with transition probabilities pn n t t e b t t b t t n n n n 0 t t n n n 0 n n a 9 also the spin flip process t t 0 is such a markov process its transition probabilities are ps s t t 1 ss exp 2 b t t 2 with s s 1 1 b the poisson feynman kac formula in this appendix we consider an independent collection of n n poisson processes in the positive half line 0 with common rate b 0 in the sense and notation of remark a 2 ii we begin with the case of a single spin here g r is an arbitrary parameter the rest of the notation has been introduced in section 1 quantum spin glass model 35 lemma b 1 operator valued pfk formula for a single spin for a single spin we have the operator identity exp bsxi gs z i e b s x i ni 1 exp gszi 1 0 dt i t i 1 n b 1 on the n spin hilbert space c 2 n c 2 n proof it is enough to prove b 1 on the single spin hilbert space c 2 so we suppress the spin index i for the auxiliary operator kg u t exp u t dt gsz t with 0 t t u we write kg u 0 1 u 0 dt d dt kg u t 1 u 0 dt kg u t gs z t b 2 and define the operator tg u s x n u kg u 0 t 0 u u 0 dt sx n u kg u t gs z t b 3 the last integrand can be rewritten as follows sx n u n t sx n t kg u t gs z t sx n u n t kg t u t gs z sx n t b 4 here we have moved sx n t to the utmost right by using n t times the relation sx f sz f sz sx based on 1 2 and the elementary spectral identity f a 1 f 1 f 1 2 a f 1 f 1 2 for any selfadjoint operator a with a 2 1 and any borel measurable function f 1 1 c now we assert that the poisson expectation of b 3 leads to tg u t 0 u u 0 dt s x n u n t kg t u t gsz t 0 t b 5 t 0 u u 0 dt tg u t gsz t 0 t u 0 b 6 equation b 5 relies on the fact that the increments n u n t as well as n t n t occurring in kg t u t exp u t dt 1 n t n t gsz are independent of n t n 0 n t for b 6 we recall that n t n t has the same distribution as n t t n 0 n t t by time homogeneity since sx n u 1 u 1 s x u 1 1 2 1 sx 1 2 1 sx u u e 2 bu b 7 we see that the mapping u 7 t 0 u exp u b sx 1 is the free or unperturbed semigroup on c 2 corresponding to g 0 and up to the factor eu b consequently the combination of b 5 and b 6 im plies that u 7 tg u satisfies the same duhamel dyson phillips integral equation as the perturbed semigroup u 7 exp u b sx 1 u gsz actually this equation is equivalent to the differential equa tion u tg u tg u b sx 1 gsz with the initial condition tg 0 1 since the solution is unique the proof is completed by considering tg 1 remark b 2 i formula b 1 dates back to kac k 74 there he has not written down it explicitly but it is the backbone of his pfk formula for the solution of the telegraph or damped wave equation for a modern account of this genre see kr 13 and also cd 06 ii we learned the pfk formula b 1 for a single spin semigroup from gaveau and schulman gs 89 who proved it by a suitable lie trotter p r chernoff product formula our proof avoids time slicing and is in the spirit of simon s second proof of the wiener feynman kac formula for schro dinger semigroups s 05 thm 6 1 see also r 94 sec 2 2 it easily extends to time dependent integrable g 0 1 r so does the alternative slightly more direct proof at the end of this appendix iii the pfk formula b 1 is equivalent to the explicit formulas l 1 g b w sinh w l 1 g cosh w g w sinh w w b 2 g 2 b 8 36 h leschke et al for the laplace transforms of the two conditional distributions of the random variable 1 0 dt i t lsi g e b i 1 si exp g 1 0 dt i t si 1 1 i 1 n b 9 up to a g independent factor this follows from b 7 with u 1 and the special case exp h 1 cosh w h sinh w w h bsxi gszi h 2 1 w 2 b 10 of the elementary spectral identity mentioned between b 4 and b 5 iv clearly we have tr exp h 2 cosh w by b 10 on the other hand by evaluating this trace in the eigenbasis of szi and using b 1 we get its spin flip representation tre h e b si i 1 1 exp gsi 1 0 dt i t cosh b si exp g 1 0 dt si i t b b 11 v as a simple example of a gibbs expectation value in the spin flip representation we consider the case g 0 and the non selfadjoint operator s z i t e b tsx i s z i e b tsx i szi e 2 b tsx i t 0 b 12 that is the operator szi in the imaginary time heisenberg picture then we have for the duhamel kubo auto correlation function of the z component of a single spin the formula tr e bsx i s z i t s z i t tre bsx i i t i t b 0 t t 1 b 13 it is due to the positive product szi t s z i t exp 2 b t t sxi and a 8 for the special case used in the main text if t t then the factor order of the two spin operators in b 13 has to be reversed it also follows that 4 13 may be viewed as an inequality for multi time correlation functions of the z component of a single spin which interacts with a transverse field only for an odd number of instants these functions vanish by szi reversal symmetry confer the argument immediately above lemma 6 1 corollary b 3 operator valued pfk formula for several spins let s 1 s n be a collection of n n pairwise commuting spin operators with component x y z and let n 1 nn be associated mutually independent poisson processes in the positive half line 0 with the common rate b 0 moreover let vn 1 1 n r be a borel measurable function and consider the boltzmann gibbs operator wn exp b n i 1 s x i vn s z 1 s z n b 14 then the operator identity wn e n b n i 1 s x i ni 1 exp 1 0 dt vn s z 1 1 t s z n n t b 15 holds on the n spin hilbert space c 2 n proof apply the arguments used in the proof of lemma b 1 for the i th spin also for all other spins j 6 i remark b 4 a two examples v 1 s 1 gs 1 vn s 1 sn v n 1 i j n gi jsis j n 2 b by b 15 formula b 11 naturally extends to trwn cosh b n s 1 sn exp 1 0 dt vn s 1 1 t sn n t b b 16 quantum spin glass model 37 alternative proof of lemma b 1 proof using the auxiliary operator kg u t introduced in the first proof we want to show that u 7 t g u s x n u kg u 0 b 17 is an operator semigroup onc 2 with generator b sx 1 gsz in the first step we pick u t 0 and get t g u t s x n u t kg u t 0 s x n u t n t s x n t kg u t t kg t 0 b 18 s x n u t n t kg t u t t s x n t kg t 0 b 19 s x n u t n t kg t u t t t g t t g u t g t b 20 the first two equations are obvious for b 19 we have moved sx n t to the right of kg u t t by us ing n t times the relation sx f sz f sz sx known from the first proof the first equality in b 20 relies on the fact that the increments n u t n t and n t n t occurring in kg t u t t exp u t t dt 1 n t n t gsz are independent of n t n 0 n t for the second equality in b 20 we recall that n t n t has the same distribution as n t t n 0 n t t by time homogeneity in the second step of this proof we combine the definition b 17 with b 2 and b 7 to get t g u 1 1 2 1 e 2 bu s x 1 u 1 0 dt sx n u kg u ut ut gsz b 21 due to sx n u kg u ut ut eu g the dominated convergence theorem gives in the operator norm sense limu 0 t g u 1 u b sx 1 1 0 dt 1 gsz b sx 1 gsz as claimed this completes the proof of b 1 by considering t g 1 c large deviation estimate for the free energy for the reader s convenience we begin by quoting theorem 1 3 4 in t 11 a without proof proposition c 1 gaussian concentration estimate for d n let f rd r be a globally lipschitz continuous function f x f x l x x with some constant l 0 arbitrary x x rdand denoting the euclidean norm on rd moreover let g g 1 gd be an independent collection of d gaussian random variables with common mean 0 and variance 1 then p f g e f g 2 exp 2 4 l 2 c 1 for any 0 it is the basis of lemma c 2 large deviation estimate for the free energy for the random free energy fn defined in 1 4 with v 0 we have p fn e fn 2 exp n 2 2 2 n 1 v 2 c 2 for any total number of spins n 2 and any 0 proof we interprete the coefficients gi j 1 i j n in the quantum hamiltonian hn defined in 1 1 as the components of a non random vector g rd with d n n 1 2 and write more explicitly hn g and fn g for its specific free energy in view of proposition c 1 we then only have to show that the function g 7 fn g is lipschitz continuous onrd with constant l v n 1 n 2 to this end we introduce 38 h leschke et al the gibbs expectation g en fn g tre hn g induced by hn g then the jensen peierls bogolyubov inequality see for example s 05 gives fn g fn g n hn g hn g g v n 3 2 1 i j n gi j g i j szi szj g g g rd c 3 v n 3 2 1 i j n gi j g i j szi szj g v n 3 2 g g 1 l g g c 4 for c 4 we have used the triangle inequality the operator inequalities 1 szi szj 1 and the jensen inequality x 1 d x between the 1 norm and the 2 norm of x x 1 xd rd by considering the last chain of inequalities also with g and g interchanged we get the desired lipschitz continuity remark c 3 a similar result was already given by crawford c 07 we include the lemma for two rea sons first it serves to make the present paper reasonably self contained second the above proof is simpler than the one in c 07 it does not need the pfk spin flip representation and can easily be extended to quantum spin glass models with additional mean field type interactions between the spins for example to the quantum mean field heisenberg spin
