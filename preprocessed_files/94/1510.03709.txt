signal and image analysis laboratory rochester institute of technology rochester usa mad 6384 rit edu bxgbme rit edu abstract in compressive sensing cs theory as the number of samples is decreased below a minimum threshold the average error of the recovery increases sufficient sampling is either required for quality reconstruction or the error is resignedly accepted however most cs work has not taken advantage of the inher ent structure in a variety of signals relevant to engineering ap plications hence this paper proposes a new method of recov ery built on basis pursuit bp called structure constrained basis pursuit scbp that constrains signals based on known structure rather than through extra sampling preliminary as sessments of this method on timit recordings of the speech phoneme a show a substantial decrease in error with a fixed 5 1 compression ratio the average recovery error is 23 8 lower versus vanilla bp more significantly this method can be applied to any cs application that samples structured data such as fsk waveforms speech and tones in these cases higher compression ratios can be reached with comparable error index terms basis pursuit compressive sensing speech coding 1 introduction in compressive sensing theory signals that are sparse in some domain can be sampled below the nyquist rate and still be successfully recovered using a convex optimization problem such as basis pursuit bp that minimizes the 1 norm of the solution 1 the number of required samples is based on the signal s sparsity and a property of the sensing matrix called coherence 1 3 if the signal is sampled below this thresh old error can be introduced into the bp solution essentially each sample is the inner product of a row of a sensing basis and the original signal each sample adds a constraint to the bp problem requiring that the final solu tion solve that particular inner product equation with enough samples the problem is constrained enough that the correct solution is within the convex set with overwhelming prob ability 1 departing from mainstream cs discussion this paper proposes structure constrained basis pursuit scbp as a modification to normal bp this method tightly bounds the solution with static bounds based on structure known a priori solutions to the system of equations that minimize the 1 norm but do not look like the expected result are excluded from the final result fig 1 illustrates how such a system would behave compared to traditional cs this paper hypothesizes that such bounds can substan tially reduce error when recovering an insufficiently sampled cs vector a speech coding application is assessed as a pre liminary test in speech blocks of samples are often rel atively sparse in a frequency domain such as the discrete cosine transform domain 4 moreover individual pho netic elements phonemes can be identified by looking at a frequency domain plot or spectrogram 5 therefore if a block of speech is guaranteed to contain only phonemes of a known spectral structure and that structure is known a priori scbp exploits static upper and lower bounds defined in the frequency domain to enforce it 1 1 relation to prior work the theory of compressed sensing was pioneered by donoho cande s romberg tao and others 1 3 6 the work of boyd vandenberghe grant and others made it possible to quickly formulate and test convex optimization problems through guidance on theory and flexible software tools 7 9 ramdas mishra and gorthi recently proposed a compressed sensing based speech code that used the dct as a sparsify ing basis 10 which inspired a desire to make such a speech code even more compelling yin morgan yang and zhang proposed a more efficient compressed sampling algorithm based on adding a rigid circulant structure to random sensing bases 11 this inspired a desire to see if rigid structure in the data could also be exploited for increased performance section 2 describes the mathematics of compressive sens ing and recovery section 3 introduces the scbp method section 4 provides the experimental setup testing the tech nique on a single phoneme a section 5 discusses the results http arxiv org abs 1510 03709 v 1

acknowledgements 2 compressive sensing theory compressive sensing concerns the sampling of sparse signals a signal x rn is called s sparse if all but s of its ele ments are zero or near zero 3 many signals are not natu rally sparse but can be represented sparsely by a linear trans formation with an orthonormal sparsifying basis the discrete cosine transform dct basis is one such sparsi fying basis used for this purpose in practical compression schemes such as jpeg 12 conventional sampling involves direct evenly spaced measurements of a signal it can be modeled roughly as in eq 1 3 ix b 1 the identity matrix i can be thought of as a sensing basis composed of time shifted impulses the resulting sampled signal is b compressed sensing theory posits that a sensing basis rn n could be defined such that not every row of the basis needs to be used in the sampling equation a matrix rm n can be formed by a subset of m n rows of this basis and sampling is performed as in eq 2 x b b rm 2 the sensing basis should be chosen so that correlation is min imized between any given row of the sensing basis and any given row of the sparsifying basis the worst case measure of this row wise correlation is typically referred to as coher ence 3 typically sensing bases of gaussian or bernoulli random numbers decently minimize this correlation 1 6 the resulting vector b is not usable in its present form it needs to be recovered into an approximation of the original signal to recover the original eq 2 is posed again with x as the unknown quantity and b as the known quantity this is an underdetermined linear system of equations likely having multiple solutions a measure based on the solution vector should be minimized or maximized to choose the optimal so lution the signal x is known to be sparse so this problem could be posed as a convex optimization problem designed to maximize sparsity unfortunately optimizing for the 0 norm a count of the number of nonzero elements in the vector is a combinatorial problem 13 however minimiz ing the 1 norm of the solution also known as basis pursuit or bp also promotes sparsity and is convex 1 7 eq 3 poses bp in terms of a cs application minimize x 1 subject to x b 3 the minimum m required to effectively recover x is a func tion of the sparsity and the coherence 2 the sparser x is and the more incoherent and are the fewer samples are required if not enough samples are taken error between the desired signal and the recovered signal will increase essen tially too few samples mean too few constraints in the basis pursuit problem and minimizing the 1 norm will not neces sarily lead to the desired solution 3 the proposed structure constrained basis pursuit this paper puts forward a modification to the basis pursuit formulation shown in eq 3 if an insufficient number of samples are taken but the sparse solution vector can be bounded between an upper bound u and a lower bound l u l x r n and r is a scale factor then a superior recovery with reduced error shall be found in eq 4 minimize x 1 1 subject to x b 1 and l x u 4 this structure constrained basis pursuit explicitly forbids solutions that minimize the 1 norm but do not have a com parable structure to the expected signal the structure is en forced using upper and lower bounds l and u the use of upper and lower bounds has been suggested previously for regression problems by boyd and vandenberghe 7 the re quirement of the compressed sensing equation being exactly solved can be loosened by restricting the solution s inexacti tude to within a handpicked the scale factor is optimized so that the magnitude of the bounds are sized to encompass the signal as closely as possible for speech whose phonemes offer predictable frequency characteristics regardless of the speaker tight bounds l and u should be able to be constructed in terms of the signal s dct domain representation if the phoneme could somehow be known or surmised tight bounds of this form would en able scbp to reduce recovery error in the absence of suffi cient compressive sampling the loudness or softness of the speech is irrelevant as the optimal scale of the bounds will be discovered by the convex solver 4 experimental setup to evaluate scbp this paper samples and recovers a subset of timit 14 all instances of a alone are extracted into individual vectors and separated into test and training sets ac cording to timit s test and train partitions respec tively this is trivial because timit provides phonetic tran scripts that define the beginning and ending sample for each phoneme in a recording vectors longer than 1024 samples are cut into 1024 sample blocks and a remainder block in or der to limit the size of the basis pursuit problem this means that an 1025 sample vector is split into a 1024 sample block and a 1 sample block in this dataset 59 of the vectors are exactly 1024 samples long and only 3 8 have a length less than or equal to 100 samples all of the vectors are sampled at 16 khz many prac tical real time speech codes impose an 8 khz sample rate because much of the speech frequency content used is con centrated between 300 3400 hz 15 however some of the higher frequency content such as fricative data is lost at this sampling rate this test is keeping the higher sampling rate in order to maintain fidelity of the signal and because speech data should become relatively more sparse as sampling rate increases perception of speech content is minimally affected by frequencies beyond 10 khz 15 the phoneme a was chosen for study because it is a rel atively orderly phoneme it is a vowel which means that in stances of it tend to be long periodic and sparse in the dct domain that said experimental evidence shows that the for mant frequencies that identify a vowel can vary widely per person 5 that effective bounds can be decided in the face of this fact shall be demonstrated by this paper upper and lower bounds were constructed by taking each a vector from timit s train set transforming it with scipy s orthonormal dct function interpolating it to exactly 1024 samples with scipy s resample function and normal izing using the 2 norm this produces row vectors i i 1 2 n for n training vectors the processed vectors are stacked into a matrix rn 1024 and the maximum and minimum of each column are the upper and lower bound for the corresponding element in a vector x r 1024 as shown in eq 5 u j max i i j l j min i i j j 1 2 1024 5 these are the most inclusive bounds based on the training data fig 2 shows the bounds defined for a there is a clear structure with low frequencies containing most of the energy and high frequencies much less represented this fol lows general speech patterns where most energy is concen trated in low frequencies for test vectors that are less than 1024 samples these bounds are decimated with matlab s resample command to the correct length these decimated bounds will still be useful as lower resolution dcts main tain the same general shape the only difference is that each bin in a dct with fewer samples will represent a wider range of frequencies 0 200 400 600 800 1000 dct

1 100 times each for vanilla bp and just over 100 times each for scbp data collection errors in one of the constrained runs led to it being thrown out and rerun resulting in exactly 100 runs consisting of 278 000 total data points for each type of bp in both cases was the dct basis and was gaussian random with zero mean and unit variance orthonormalized with qr factorization 7 in the scbp

the mean energy of the original signal as shown in eq 6 nmse n k 1 x k x k 2 n k 1 x k 2 6 the data from the evaluation clearly favors scbp in this application fig 3 compares scbp to bp scbp s distri

over all a data with the extra constraints and the requirement that be optimized as part of the bp operation scbp is considerably slower than bp actual timing numbers are not presented in this paper due to the fact that the speed of the machines used to perform the test was not controlled but there was roughly a six fold increase in recovery time with scbp vs vanilla bp future work could determine if could be efficiently com puted beforehand based on knowledge of the bp inputs in or der to free the convex solver from the task 6 conclusion this paper proposed structure constrained basis pursuit scbp as a method of recovering a signal from insuffi cient compressed samples with lower error while typical cs applications build bp constraints solely from compres sive samples scbp enables static constraints based on the signal s structure to act as an effective substitute a small speech related testbed demonstrated compelling improve ments of 23 8 in recovery error due to scbp this provides numerous opportunities for future work discovering the structure of a signal before bp is an open question com pressed samples measured with an appropriate sensing basis could betray some structure of the original signal hidden markov models and other speech modeling techniques could be applied to predict the structure of compressed speech in a future work the authors intend to pursue the exploitation of cs basis structure for feature extraction to enable scbp in practical speech coding however scbp has a much wider application than as a method for speech coding any compressed sensing applica tion where the data is predictably structured can benefit from this technique resulting in lower sampling rates that still ac ceptably recover data two obvious examples are tone detec tors and fsk receivers where the problem can be tightly con strained to only seek a narrow range of frequencies trans forms besides frequency domain transforms may also be used to great effect while bound constraints have been a feature of convex solvers for some time there exists substantial oppor tunity to exploit them through scbp for improved sampling 7 acknowledgements the authors would like to thank dr ernest fokoue for his assistance with convex optimization concepts and his insight that helped increase the performance of scbp 8 references 1 d l donoho compressed
