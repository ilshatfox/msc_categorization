communication vvlc is a promis ing communication technology aiming simultaneous data transmission and illumination through vehicle light emitting diode led lights vvlc is considered as a secure comple mentary technology to radio frequency rf communications due to its rf interference free nature license free wide spectrum availability non frequency selective flat fading and directional line of sight los channel characteristics fundamentally wireless communication channel models can be classified into two categories deterministic and stochastic channel models a deterministic channel model aims to predict the channel characteristics in a specific location with respect to transmitter and receiver locations as well as the surrounding environment exploiting computational electro magnetics with ray tracing and finite difference time domain fdtd methods however deterministic channel models lack b turan and s coleri are with the department of electrical and electronics engineering koc university sariyer istanbul turkey e mail bturan 14 ku edu tr scoleri ku edu tr computational efficiency and heavily depend on site specific geometry with dielectric properties of scatter materials on the other hand stochastic approaches are utilized to reproduce the statistical behaviors of the channel yielding non site specific but lower accuracy models stochastic channel models are classified into geometry based stochastic models gbsm where ensemble of the scatterers are placed in different geometrical positions based on statistical distributions and non gbsm fit measured or generated channel parameters into certain probability distributions stochastic approaches con front challenges with incorporating all relevant channel fea tures gbsm highly depend on the probabilistic distributions of physical parameters i e transmitter receiver distance an gle scatterer locations whereas non gbsm stochastic chan nel models lack instantaneous channel spatial consistency as all channel parameters in one channel realization are generated for a single location 1 considering the required effort to obtain various probabilistic distributions for different environ ments stochastic channel models generally rely on certain assumptions where channel parameters are fitted averaged out for generalized environments and possible scenarios lacking precision moreover mathematical expressions and probability distribution fitting constraints impose additional assumptions on the stochastic models leading limited accuracy recently machine learning ml methods are proposed for channel modelling to overcome site specific high complexity limitations of deterministic approaches and low accuracy limi tations of stochastic models 2 moreover highly complicated mediums such as in body underwater vehicle to vehicle v 2 v 3 optical and molecular communication channels 4 inherent certain distortion effects which are challenging to be expressed analytically therefore ml based channel mod elling aims to develop low complexity and accurate models for complicated channels through direct learning of the robust patterns in the data without imposing any assumptions on the analytical expressions moreover ml models distinguish over scenarios by providing physical parameters corresponding to the specific scenario as inputs channel modelling with ml can be classified into super vised and unsupervised learning based with respect to the labels of training data supervised learning based channel modelling aims to learn a general function between inputs and outputs yielding solution for regression problems such as path loss predictions through labeled data 5 6 on the other hand unsupervised learning based channel modelling is favorable for clustering of multi path components mpcs

measurements for unique environ ment yielding received signal strength rss with respect to transmitter receiver angle and distance 23 however considering core dependency of vvlc channel model on channel loss due to ambient light and atmospheric effects i e fading scintillation with mobility ray tracing based studies lack consideration of solar radiation and optical turbulence effects on vlc link moreover recursive methods rely on assumptions such as lambertian reflection for all surfaces while empirical models represent only the small portion of usage scenarios for deterministic models on the other hand stochastic channel models offer increased flexibility reduced computational complexity and lower ac curacy when compared to deterministic approach vlc and optical wireless

distributions are utilized to fit measured cir for an indoor owc channel under the consideration of gbsm 18 proposed a 2 d non stationary gbsm to generate cir for vvlc channel obtained gaussian distributions for channel gain and root mean square rms delay spread considering the limited applicability of deterministic and stochastic methods on vvlc channel models due to site specific characteristics and low accuracy ml based channel model frameworks with the capability of learning complex features pave the way to accurately model vvlc channel propagation to date ml based owc channel modelling has not been investigated in the literature however ml based channel model frameworks trained through measurement data sets on contrary to relying numerous assumptions are proposed for rf communications 3 4 25 30 considering millimeter wave mmwave communication channels huang et al pro posed an artificial neural network ann enabled channel model framework to obtain channel

channels authors in 30 proposed an ann based channel model outperforming generalized gamma polynomial fitting and dual slope distance break point models for path loss predictions ramya et al showed that non parametric learning based random forest method increased v 2 v channel path loss prediction accuracy with 2 2 db mean and 1 5 db standard deviation of absolute error when compared to log distance path loss model 3 on the other hand 4 proposed an ann based molecular communications channel model to predict channel model parameters accurately where obtaining exact analytical channel model is challenging thereby ml can be regarded as an appealing approach for accurate and computationally efficient wireless communication channel modelling taking into account the considerable amount of work in the vlc channel modelling literature none of the studies to date characterized vvlc links targeting v 2 v with respect to various ambient light exhaust plume induced optical turbu 3 lence

ambient light vvlc channel frequency response and path loss measurements conducted via production vehicle led lights in real road scenarios are utilized to train and validate ml based models proposed channel model frameworks are directly learned from measurement data sets yielding higher accuracy than slope intercept fits proposed for vlc channel furthermore a comparative study between random forest non parametric learning method and two types of neural networks nns multilayer perceptron mlp radial basis function rbf is conducted to model vvlc channel path loss the goal is to obtain a ml based vvlc channel propagation model framework that is not overly complex but still generalizes well and is accurate enough for practical vvlc applications in this work we leverage the use of ml techniques towards channel path loss and channel frequency response estimation to accurately model vvlc channel with respect to given physical conditions in particular we propose exploiting ml to predict vvlc link quality depending on features of ambient light inter vehicular distance transmitter receiver geometry and modulation frequency to enable better utilization of the vvlc channel figure 1 ml based vvlc channel propagation modelling the main novelties and contributions of this work are as follows we extracted the importance of predictor variables to ob tain vvlc channel loss and channel frequency response cfr through measured vvlc propagation channels we fit the measured channel loss data to current vlc channel models and demonstrated that the current models do not capture channel loss deviations due to mobility and environment induced variations this is the first work to provide a measurement based quantitative analysis of vvlc channel under various ambient lighting optical turbulence through exhaust plume inter vehicular dis tance and geometry with both los and dlos conditions we proposed mlp rbf nn and random forest learning based channel model frameworks to be trained with the predictor variables of inter vehicular distance geometry ambient light optical turbulence existence lane occu pation and receiver inclination angle features yielding highly accurate channel loss and channel frequency re sponse for the cases that proposed frameworks were not trained with this is the first study to propose ml based vvlc channel propagation models we evaluated the validity and performance of the pro posed models with their sensitivity to the amount of training data this is the first work to analyze the validity and robustness of ml based channel model frameworks for vvlc channels across a wide range of varying physical conditions the remainder of this paper is organized in the following way section ii outlines the vvlc channel differences from rf

atmospheric interaction yielding a combination of absorption and scattering plays an important role on vvlc channel characteristics vvlc chan nel characterization and utilization further depends on optical turbulence ambient light induced noise transmitter receiver geometry and low pass frequency response characteristics of leds and optical receivers optical turbulence sourced by random temperature fluctua tions on road surface and around exhaust plumes distort vvlc signals resulting optical power fluctuations 31 however accurate characterization of optical turbulence and finding a mathematical expression to incorporate into vvlc channel model is challenging due to mobility induced abrupt temper ature wind weather changes 4 wavelength nm 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 s

during day time thus the number of photons to reach the optical receiver from vvlc transmitter decreases moreover photons absorbed from ambient lights and solar radiation excite electrons and cause them to generate current in the form receiver shot noise and thermal noise sunlight contamination dominates the noise and determines the number of photons captured by the receiver for daylight conditions as solar spectrum see fig 2 a is stronger in the visible light region optical sun interference filters that attenuate communication signals are not favorable for practical vvlc systems there fore with the increase in ambient light less photons from vvlc signals reach to the receiver and dynamic range of the vvlc receiver decreases due to increased receiver noise leading more channel

driven minimum illumination field of view fov with the utilization of beam shaping optics such as lenses reflectors and mirrors determine los and dlos characteristics of vvlc channel compared to indoor and underwater vlc channels diffuse components sourced from nearby scatters is weak for vvlc channels hence vvlc channels are mainly explored for their los characteristics low pass frequency response of both leds and optical receivers impose additional limitations on the vvlc received optical signal power as high frequency modulated signals are transmitted and received with lower optical

fading poses limitation on rf based vehicular communication system performance due to different transmit ter and receiver geometries mobility nearby scatter objects and dynamic propagation conditions however vvlc utiliz ing non coherent vehicle led lights and receiver apertures in the order of millions of wavelengths is immune to multipath fading with no small fading 34 even though multipath fading is not a major concern for vvlc multipath dispersion sourced from the transmitted signals outreach to the receiver via different paths and times cause symbols spreads yielding intersymbol interference isi road surface with different reflection properties and nearby scatters such as guard rails and vehicles can be considered as main source of multipath dispersion for vvlc however considering the low amplitude of mpcs when compared to strong los signals multipath dispersion has subtle isi effects on practical vvlc inter vehicular distances i e 10 m to 100 m on the other hand high doppler spread in vehicular en vironments for rf based vehicular schemes induces short channel coherence time requiring accurate channel estimation for reliable communications however for vvlc consider ing 650 nm wavelength taillight led at a vehicle speed of 250 km h yields 210 mhz doppler frequency or 0 00015 nm wavelength shift from its nominal value since the optical receiver detects only the intensity of the optical wave the generated photo current will deviate from the expected level based only on the spectral sensitivity a w of the receiver even though this results with electrical signal to noise ratio snr variation at the receiver side as the wavelength shift due to doppler spread is subtle doppler spread can be regarded negligible for vvlc channels vvlc channels

better fit for two term exponential ds 2 fitting results indicate that for night conditions path loss variations below 20 m and same lane scenarios is higher when compared to weaker illumination region of nearby lane and distances over 20 m therefore it can be concluded that fitting based generalizations are not enough to obtain accurate vvlc channel path loss existing channel models lack incorporating all features of ambient light led frequency dependent characteristics optical turbulence effects and reflections i e road surface with respect to receiver orientation angle effects on vvlc channel thus they provide limited generalization ability to accurately characterize vvlc channel path loss therefore vvlc channel models generated with the consideration of ambient noise led

transmitter receiver vehicle geometries ambient light and op tical turbulence considerations is not convenient hence mod eling the physical parameter relationships by nns and random forest through machine learning is utilized therefore channel loss data collected from different vvlc scenarios are used to train ml models yielding a scenario based vvlc channel path loss and cfr framework we describe the proposed ml based channel model frameworks in section v a and section v b a neural networks based channel model framework neuron is the basic component and processing unit of nns neurons produce an output vector of nns through multipli cation of input vector x x 1 x 2 xn and its weight vectors w w 1 w 2 wn where differentiable activation functions f between layers and bias to shift activation function are additionally employed can be generalized in the following form y foj m j 1 woj fji n i 1 wjixi j out 4 where foj woj and fji wji are activation functions and weights from neuron to output input to neuron respectively minimization of the output error according to target optimiza tion criteria i e mean square error mean absolute percentage error is the objective of neuron models two nn architectures mlp and rbf nns are proposed to generalize vvlc channel path loss and channel frequency response 1 mlp mlp networks are feed forward nns compromise of multiple hidden layers involving three stages at the first stage input training pattern is feed forwarded using activation functions then associated error and weights are backpropa gated through learning function outputs are compared with target values where the weights are readjusted to minimize the error at each iteration activation function is selected to be monotonically non decreasing and differentiable for regression problems sigmoid function in the hidden layers and linear function in the output layers are utilized mlps unlike simple perceptron are capable of classifying linearly inseparable multivariate patterns and can solve complicated problems 2 rbf nn radial basis function neural networkss rbf nns are three layer feed forward networks where the input is transformed by radially symetric basis functions at the hidden radial basis layer rbf nns consist of an input layer a hidden radial basis layer with a non linear rbf activation function and a linear output layer the number of nodes in the hidden layer depends on the complexity of the problem however rbf nns generally require more neurons than standard mlp networks this is because sigmoid neurons can have outputs over a large region of the input space while radial basis neurons only respond to relatively small regions of the input space rbf nns perform better when many training vectors are available designing rbf nn takes less time than training a mlp network the nonlinear activation function for rbf nn can be gaussian function multi quadratic function inverse multi quadratic or cauchy function however 36 stated that the activation function selection is not crucial for performance of the rbf nn gaussian activation functions defined by mean and standard deviation is the most common choice for rbf nn in rbf nn the connections between the input and the hidden layers are not weighted the inputs therefore reach the hidden layer node unchanged and then the output of 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110

5 where x x 1 x 2 xn is the input data vm is the center of the mth neuron of the hidden layer having same dimension with x m is the spread of the mth gaussian and gm x is the output of the mth gaussian function m denotes the total number of hidden layer nodes non linear mapping of input layer x gm x whereas output layer linear mapping gm x yk forms a linear combination of hidden layer functions with weighted sums as follows yk m i 1 wikgm x k 1 2 n 6 where yk is the output of rbf nn wik are the weights of linear mapping n is the number of output layer nodes for the input signals closer to the centre range of the gauss kernel the hidden layer nodes will produce larger output therefore the radial basis function network is a local approaching network and it has a superiority of fast learning speed spread of rbf nn defines the selectivity of the network as small spread implies very selective and many neurons are needed to obtain smooth function fit on the other hand large spread implies less selective network output yielding smoother function approximations rbf nn tend to have good interpolation properties but not as good extrapolation properties as mlps using a given number of neurons mlp performs better for extrapolation purposes on the other hand rbf nn are robust to adversarial noise due to their non linear nature b random forest learning based channel model ensemble learning utilizing multiple individual decision trees to solve classification and regression problems provide superior generalization performance due to its insensitive nature to variable scaling and inclusion of irrelevant variables 37 random forest is one of the prominent ensemble learning algorithms combining estimates from multiple decision trees with random selection of features for training to yield true output through bootstrap aggregation 38 randomization and averaging estimates from multiple decision trees further provide robustness to noisy measurements the maximum tree depth and the size of the ensemble determines the accuracy of the algorithm random forest algorithm sort the importance of features enabling feature dimension reduction to avoid overfitting with lower complexity models vi system model and problem formulation two different model frameworks are considered yielding vvlc channel frequency response and channel path loss predictions utilizing ds 1 and ds

vehicular distance led modulation frequency ambi ent light levels occupied lane optical turbulence level and receiver elevation angle are inputs of the proposed models whereas model output yields channel path loss the vvlc channel path loss predictions can be considered as function approximation where the goal is to approximate an unknown mapping f x y from a set of input parameters x dl ol

data set using rmse for path loss models 90 80 60 30 and 10 of ds 2 samples are utilized for training while the rest portions 10 20 40 70 90 are used as test set for performance evaluations c data preprocessing input values of the proposed models vary in different ranges as they are different physical units therefore input parameters are normalized and mapped to values between 1 to 1 inverse conversion is executed at the output to obtain predicted values outlier samples captured through measurement errors are excluded from all data sets for path loss prediction models high variance region is observed for closer inter vehicular distances due to the narrower beam divergence angle thus k means clustering is utilized to further label the data as high variance region and low variance region 1 k means clustering k means clustering iteratively par titions n observations into k non overlapping clusters where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean expected maximization approach of k means clustering assigns data points to a cluster where the sum of the squared distance between the data points and the mean of all the data points that belong to that cluster centroid is at the minimum k means clustering is conducted to define low variance and high variance regions with respect to inter vehicular distances for channel path loss prediction models as the initial choice of centroids can affect the output clusters the algorithm is executed 10 times with different initializations to obtain two fair cluster partitions of ds 2 3297 samples of 7686 samples is found to be in high variance region with maximum distance of 38 m whereas 4389 samples are considered in low variance regions as depicted in fig 10 high variance and low variance region labels are added to

for vvlc cfr moreover vna model feature selection is perceived to have a considerable effect on the predictor performance for cfr estimations as vna drives the led through frequency swept electrical voltage signals and accurate calibrations can not be executed for low impedance leds on contrary to 50 load receiver angle inclination is concluded to be the least important feature for both data sets hence reflections from road surface can be considered to be negligible for dlos when compared to los transmissions d hyperparameter selection ml model parameters that can be selected before training process are known as hyperparameters grid search random search and bayesian optimization methods are commonly utilized for hyperparameter optimization hyperparameter op timization plays an important role for ml models to obtain accurate prediction results in reduced training time while en suring simultaneous convergence hence avoiding over fitting in this work grid search is employed to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters through search of all possible points in the given range for mlp the following parameter intervals are considered for both cfr and path loss models number of neurons for 2 hidden layers between 1 to 50 and the number of maximum validation failures between 3 to 10 minimum performance gradient between 1 e 3 to 1 e 8 with 1 e 5 intervals considering rbf nn selection of spread is important to obtain smoother function therefore spread values are evaluated between 0 2 to 10 for both cfr and path loss estimation models for path loss predictions with random forest the number of decision trees between 150 and 300 and the maximum tree depths between 16 and 1024 are evaluated the optimum hyperparameters yielding best predictions are obtained as follows for cfr prediction mlp model 30 neurons at first hidden layer 20 neurons at second hidden layer whereas for 20 neurons at first hidden layer and 10 neurons at second hidden layer for cfr maximum validation failure of 5 minimum performance gradient of 1 e 6 are set for both mlp networks rbf nn spread factor for path loss is 0 2 and 0 7 for cfr for random forest the depth of trees and the number of decision trees are finally chosen as 253 and 710 respectively for path loss predictor e model implementation we developed the proposed models using matlab soft ware running on dell t 5610 workstation the workstation is equipped with nvidia quadro k 2000 graphics card and 12 cpu cores enabling parallel training on gpu and cpu multi cores 1 mlp framework for vvlc channel path loss predic tions data sets of mlp networks are splitted as 60 training 20 testing and 20 validation then the input features were scaled between 1 to 1 five fold cross validation scheme is employed to determine best model for mlp our network is multi layer perceptron mlp type feed forward architecture it is based on a supervised training using scaled conjugate gradient back propagation we use hyperbolic tangent sigmoid function tansig in the hidden layers and linear function purline in the output layer mlp networks for both cfr and path loss predictions are modeled with a perceptron of three layers two hidden layers and one output layer the number of neurons per layer is varied to improve performance 2 rbf framework for vvlc channel path loss pre dictions the rbf framework created for vvlc channel path loss predictions has the gaussian function as activation function in its hidden layer and linear function in its output layer training of the hidden layer involves the determination of the radial basis functions by specifying appropriate m values of 5 this parameter depend only on the input data and are independent of the outputs yielding unsupervised learning on the other hand output layer is trained by a supervised learning method where the synaptic weights are updated in proportion to the difference between the network and target output the input data is scaled between 1 and 1 where 70 of data sets is used for training and 30 of the all samples are used for testing rbf nns the spread of the gaussian for cfr estimator rbf nn and path loss estimator rbf nn is defined as

validation results based on experimental measurements demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed frameworks to predict or generate vvlc channel path loss with respect to relevant input parameters revealing the importance of the features affecting vvlc channel performance through ensemble learning accurate channel loss and cfr predictions can be obtained moreover data acquisition for channel modelling can be executed in a systematic manner as more concentration will be given to relatively important features however the importance of the features can be experimental setup dependent increased variance in the captured data of the feature increases its importance for example with wide fov optical receiver angular orientation may be less important when compared to narrower fov receiver therefore experimental setup plays an important role for the feature importance selection and generalization ability of the ml model for vvlc channels ml techniques are demonstrated to yield better generalization than fitting based models even for the reduced amount of training data therefore the main drawback of big data acquisition to train ml models is not the case for vvlc channel modelling through ml methods prediction accuracy obtained through the proposed ml meth ods can be further increased through refinement of the models with the evaluation of various algorithms and hyper parameter optimization proposed ml models built and validated through real world measurements enable new scenario based data set generation as they are not constrained with probabilistic distributions analytical expressions and assumptions parameters extracted from generated data sets and ml based channel models will be closer to field measurements references 1 l raschkowski p kyo sti k kusume and
