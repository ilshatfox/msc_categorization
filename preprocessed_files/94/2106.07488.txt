ieee transactions on multimedia vol 1 no 1 march 2021 1 user guided personalized image aesthetic assessment based on deep reinforcement learning pei lv jianqi fan xixi nie weiming dong member ieee xiaoheng jiang bing zhou mingliang xu member ieee and changsheng xu fellow ieee abstract personalized image aesthetic assessment piaa has recently become a hot topic due to its usefulness in a wide variety of applications such as photography film and television e commerce fashion design and so on this task is more seriously affected by subjective factors and samples provided by users in order to acquire precise personalized aesthetic distribution by small amount of samples we propose a novel user guided personalized image aesthetic assessment framework this frame work leverages user interactions to retouch and rank images for aesthetic assessment based on deep reinforcement learning drl and generates personalized aesthetic distribution that is more in line with the aesthetic preferences of different users it mainly consists of two stages in the first stage personalized aesthetic ranking is generated by interactive image enhancement and manual ranking meanwhile two policy networks will be trained the images will be pushed to the user for manual re touching and simultaneously to the enhancement policy network the enhancement network utilizes the manual retouching results as the optimization goals of drl after that the ranking process performs the similar operations like the retouching mentioned before these two networks will be trained iteratively and alternatively to help to complete the final personalized aesthetic assessment automatically in the second stage these modified images are labeled with aesthetic attributes by one style specific classifier and then the personalized aesthetic distribution is gen erated based on the multiple aesthetic attributes of these images which conforms to the aesthetic preference of users better once these two stages are completed our approach can automatically generate personalized aesthetic assessment and ranking of the images provided by the user through comparing with previous mentioned personalized aesthetic distribution compared with other existing methods our approach has achieved new state of the art in the task of personalized image aesthetic assessment on the public ava and flickr aes datasets index terms image aesthetic assessment personalized image enhancement deep reinforcement learning user interaction personalized aesthetic distribution i introduction personalized image aesthetic assessment is a vitalproblem that has numbers of applications such as film and television etc due to the subjectivity of individual preference and the vast of images it is challenging for users to immediately outcrop images that satisfy them in this paper we aim to model more accurate personalized aesthetic distribution pei lv jianqi fan xixi nie xiaoheng jiang bing zhou and

small amount of user interactions and personalized images which helps to more quickly find out images that meet the user s aesthetic preferences in recent years plenty of work has been devoted to image aesthetic assessment some hand crafted low level vi sual features 1 6 and high level aesthetic attributes 7 9 have been proposed to estimate the image aesthetic quality although using these traditional aesthetic features to classify images has made some progress their accuracy can still not satisfy the requirement of different users it is gratifying that the state of the art features extracted by deep convolution neural networks 10 21 have been involved to evaluate the aesthetic quality of images due to its powerful representation however a small set of annotated images are insufficient to fully describe the user s personal preference owing to its strong subjectivity some methods 10 22 24 have introduced personalized features into aesthetic assessment nevertheless in these methods users are only allowed to express limited aesthetic preferences through the existing original images without changing the contents of them the image retouching results by different users shown in fig 1 show that the existing original images can not fully highlight the aesthetic preferences of different users fortunately deep convolutional neural networks dc nns have shown great promise for image enhancement many approaches have been employed for automatic photo enhancement including style transfer 25 27 and automatic image enhancement 28 34 the goal of style transfer is that the combined image will be generated via reconstructing the content of one image and the style of another one since the publicly available dataset mainly represents general style ar x iv 2 10 6 07 48

automatic retouched results c the personalized aesthetic distributions of different users characteristics it can not accurately reflect the personalized aesthetic preferences of different users automatic image en hancement intends to gain higher quality images based on black box image enhancer 33 34 which lacks of the full consideration of the personalized aesthetic attributes hence by retouching the image with specific user interaction we can obtain more accurate user personalized aesthetics distribution as shown in fig 2 in addition training one high quality dcnn requires a great quantity of data the approach of personalized image enhancement can be used to alleviate the problem of insufficient training samples in this paper we propose one new framework for image aesthetic assessment which is termed user guided person alized image aesthetic assessment ug piaa ug piaa mainly consists of two stages user guided image aesthetic ranking and personalized aesthetic distribution generation there are two inherent motivations here on the one hand most of public image dataset can not highlight the personalized aesthetic preference of different users at the same time even if different users retouch one same image various results will often be obtained as shown in fig 1 based on this fact we introduce personalized image enhancement into the task of image aesthetic assessment which is not covered by previous work on the other hand the task of ranking and retouching are heavily dependent on visual feedback common users need to complete these tasks serially and finally output results based on continuous feedback rather than directly inferring the final result from the input for aesthetic evaluation more comprehensive retouching and ranking process needs to take into account different types of operations as well as the selective usage of these operations since above two kinds of operations can naturally be modeled as the correspond ing sequential decision making procedure deep reinforcement learning is involved to help to complete the image aesthetic assessment the pipeline of our ug piaa is as following it firstly uses the public aesthetic dataset to initialize two different policy networks and then uses the modified images by the user interaction to optimize the personalized policy networks in the retouching process of user interaction the original images will be pushed to the image enhancement policy network while the retouched images by the user will serve as the feedback to this network after that the retouched images will be pushed to the image ranking policy network while the ranked results by the user will be treated as the feedback of the ranking policy network the above process will be iterated for multiple rounds until the new image sequence generated by the proposed framework meets the user s aesthetic pref erence finally we use the modified image sequence from stage one to generate the personalized aesthetic distribution after that the correlation coefficient between the personalized aesthetics distribution of the enhanced images and that of the original images is obtained the larger the coefficient the higher the aesthetic score and ranking of the images some examples of the visualization results are shown in fig 2 to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach we conduct comprehensive ablation studies on two large scale public datasets through in depth and insightful experiments our major contributions are listed as follow we propose a novel user guided personalized aesthetic assessment framework via a small amount of retouching and ranking interactions we introduce the personalized image enhancement incor porating user interaction into the personalized aesthetic ranking with the aim of highlighting users personalized aesthetic preferences we develop a deep reinforcement learning approach for personalized aesthetic ranking through online fine tuning by user interactions experiments show that our results outperform existing methods in the field of personalized image aesthetic enhancement and ranking it is to be mentioned that this work extends the prelim inary version of our paper 22 which is mainly improved in the following three aspects 1 we provide more compre hensive discussion on the introduction of personalized image aesthetics enhancement into the personalized image aesthetics assessment and make an intensive evaluation of the proposed personalized image aesthetic enhancement 2 we use the deep reinforcement learning approach instead of svmrank in the personalized image aesthetics ranking and quantitatively evaluate its performance 3 we perform more ablation studies for the personalized aesthetic assessment which enables an insight understanding of the results the positive effect of personalized aesthetics enhancement on personalized aesthetic assessment also points towards a promising avenues for future research ii related work a image aesthetics assessment image aesthetics assessment is an important problem in computer vision and computer graphics in recent years previous studies mainly focus on hand crafted features 1 2 and high level features 3 4 6 8 35 36 extracted from high quality images however hand crafted features are not comprehensive it is often unable to fully capture the diversity and aesthetic features of images since deep learning ieee transactions on multimedia vol 1 no 1 march 2021 3 can make up for the above defects significant progress in this research area has been achieved through deep neural networks 10 13 18 20 22 23 37 41 lu et al 13 first proposed a double columned deep convolutional neural network based on alexnet their approach combined global and local features adopted a two way network structure and output the probability of images aesthetic classification wang et al 41 proposed the first multi patch method for the prediction of image aesthetic score with the original image aspect ratios being preserved kong et al 37 developed a deep network architecture by combining the aesthetic attributes and content information of images to assess aesthetic quality however due to the strong subjectivity of image aesthetic assessment it is difficult to quantify the criteria for image aesthetic some studies 10 19 20 22 23 took the subjectivity of aesthetic assessment into consideration yeh et al 19 20 introduced the concept of personalized ranking and incorporated user feedback into the ranking algorithm to describe the personalized aesthetic style of the user vlad et al 40 proposed a structure that could maintain the resolution of the original image and input images of any size for training feature maps of different scales are extracted from different layers of the network and merged to train a cnn model to predict the image aesthetic score in order to learn different human cognition of image aesthetics zhu et al 10 proposed a piaa method based on meta learning with bilevel gradient optimization xu et al 42 exploited the attention mechanism to learn the spatial attention map of image layout and find the spatial importance in aesthetics li et al 24 introduced personality traits to the task of the image aesthetics assessment and presented a personality assisted multi task deep learning framework for both generic and personalized image aesthetics assessment lv et al 22 proposed to continuously optimize user aesthetic preferences through multiple rounds of simple user interactions however during the interaction phase user can only rerank the images without changing the contents of these images but simply ranking the images does not highlight personalized aesthetic preferences very well in order to solve the above problems and acquire better personalized aesthetic distribution we further involve user retouching and re ranking operations into the interaction phase b aesthetic image enhancement image enhancement is dedicated to improving the aesthet ics of an image through transforming or altering the image using various methods and techniques the work in 22 25 31 36 43 49 enhanced images to obtain more satisfying results over the years for the problem of style transfer gatys et al 25 applied the dcnn to produce impressive stylization results by decomposing content and style from images liao et al 27 founded semantically mean ingful dense correspondences between two input images and produced reconstructed results of visual style transfer through deep image analogy deng et al 43 designed one generator for enhancing low quality images from the perspective of color transformation fang et al 44 decomposed the entire task of image enhancement into a series of independent filters and connected these filters to complete the final goal from the perspective of image aesthetics some researchers also improved the quality of images by automatically cutting 29 43 45 47 and automatic composition 48 49 li et al 46 proposed a strategy of clipping images to make them more beauty by reinforcement learning the above researches mainly consider the image en hancement of common aesthetic attributes recently some researchers tried to model the user s personalized preference to produce personalized stylization in the process of automatic image retouching unfortunately existing algorithms do not fully consider personalized issues such as the user s subjec tivity in view of this we utilize subjective operations in the process of image modification according to the retouching and reordering of images by users c reinforcement learning reinforcement learning is an important branch of ma chine learning which is widely used in games robotics natural language processing image enhancement 29 31 etc there have been some excellent work in recent years like deep q network dqn 50 double q learning 51 dueling network 52 in reinforcement learning the core problem 53 is how an agent learns to adapt a possibly complex initially unknown environment in a sequential trial and error process it can directly obtain the learning information and update the model parameters by receiving the reward of the action park et al 29 proposed a deep reinforcement learning method for color reinforcement it regarded color enhancement as markov decision process and trained an agent to learn the optimal global enhancement sequence in each step when one professional photographer retouches images in real life each operation will depend on the visual feedback presented by the current image the above series of operations can be described as a trial and error process which is a sequential decision problem inspired by this idea we use reinforcement learning to model sequential decision problems of retouching and ranking the reinforcement learning algo rithm based on the value function doesn t need to change the selection strategy but it is not suitable for the large scale re inforcement learning process the policy based reinforcement learning algorithm easily converges to local optimal rather than the global one therefore this paper uses the actor critic algorithm which breaks the limitations of the above two kinds of algorithms the actor chooses the next action according to the strategy and the critic gives the score according to the action selected by the actor we propose a personalized image enhancement module that adapts the retouched images as the input to the actor critic neural network the actor network is used to generate enhanced images and the critic network is used to score the generated images so that we can obtain a personalized retouched image with the user preferences as a guide iii framework in this paper we propose a novel user guided person alized image aesthetic assessment framework based on deep ieee transactions on multimedia vol 1 no 1 march 2021 4 fig 3 the overview framework of user guided personalized image aesthetic assessment which consists of two stages for stage 1 in the process of user interaction k images are firstly retrieved from the aesthetic database then it is necessary to judge whether it is the first round of interaction if it is the original images and the retouched images by users will be directly pushed to the enhancement policy network in pairs for model training and then these images and the ranked images by users are further pushed to the ranking policy network for model training otherwise the original images are firstly auto retouched by the enhancement policy network and then retouched manually by users these two types of retouched images will also be pushed to the enhancement policy network for its fine tuning the similar process will be implemented for the ranking policy network after several iterative operations these two policy networks are able to output the ranking sequence of personalized enhanced images which satisfy users aesthetic preferences for stage 2 the aesthetic distribution of users can be generated by multi label classification of the aesthetic attributes of those modified images which are from several rounds of interactions reinforcement learning illustrated in fig 3 it comprises of two stages user guided image aesthetic ranking and person alized aesthetic distribution generation the framework uses the images in public aesthetic dataset to initialize the policy network and then uses the user interaction to optimize the personalized policy network the user guided image aesthetic ranking is divided into two kinds of situations if it is the first round of user interaction the enhancement policy network uses the retrieved images and the user retouched images for model learning subsequently the retouched images and the user ranked images are used by the ranking policy network for model learning under another situation the enhancement policy network is used to automatically retouch the retrieved images and then the ranking policy network is used to automatically rank the retouched images after several rounds of iterative interaction we will obtain the final personal ized policy network that satisfies the aesthetic preferences of users finally the personalized enhanced image sequences are obtained through the above process and then multiple labels of images are obtained by aesthetic attribute classifier and personalized aesthetic distribution is generated based on the ranking of the images and multiple aesthetic attributes representing the user s aesthetic preferences accurately in this section we will describe in detail the procedures and techniques involved above a interactive personalized aesthetic enhancement in order to reduce the influence of the instability and randomness caused by small amount of samples during the training phase usar 22 introduced the user interaction to optimize the results generated by the primary personalized ranking module however usar did not allow users to retouch images according to personal preference different from usar this paper improves the interactive strategy and proposes a new module of personalized image aesthetic enhancement the process of user interaction is described in detail as follows shown in fig 4 our approach generates the personalized aesthetic distribution representing the user s pref erence through multiple rounds of retouching and ranking interactions of the user as usar pointed out it is clear that only one round of iteration is not so convincing therefore in order to obtain satisfactory results for users n rounds of adjustment and editing operations will be performed to ieee transactions on multimedia vol 1 no 1 march 2021 5 fig 4 the flow chart of user interaction the desired ranking results will be obtained after n iterations in each interaction the user can perform two operations rank and retouch which will guide the optimization of the policy networks continuously update the personalized dataset of the user s aesthetic preference in this paper the user interaction contains two types of operations images ranking and images retouching exposure gamma white balance contrast tone color curve saturation wnb etc for the retouching process users can adjust the aesthetic parameters of images to conform to their aesthetic preferences by recording the retouching process of one user and training the enhancement module we can acquire more precise personalized aesthetic model in detail we describe the image enhancement process as selecting the next operation based on the effect of the current image and finally simulating the entire sequence of operations for image modification this process can be regarded as a sequential decision problem inspired by hu 31 we use actor critic strategy to learn the personalized aesthetic enhancement model the actor critic strategy is shown in fig 5 the actor chooses actions according to the strategy the critic network updates the value function according to the reward that is given by the environment and guides the actor network to choose better strategy as the number of iterations increases the actor obtain the reasonable probability of each action and the critic constantly improve the reward value of action under each state the above process can be described as p s a s is state space and a is action space in the reinforcement learning framework the intermediate images are generated in the retouching process a is the set of all filter operations as we know in 31 the filter parameters need to be determined after choosing the filter operation when retouching an image action space consists of two parts the discrete set of filter a 1 and the continuous set of filter parameter a 2 a 1 contains eight kinds of filter operations that reflect image aesthetic features fig 5 deep reinforcement image aesthetic enhancement the actor com prises of filters policy network and filter parameter policy network the critic belongs to the value based learning algorithm the former requires reward and punishment information to adjust the probability of taking various filters and filter parameters in different states the latter will be updated in a single step to calculate the reward and punishment value for each step fig 6 the architecture of actor critic network the actor network shares the same convolution layer as the critic network and produces different results through different output layers nc two strategies will be generated in the actor network one of which is followed by softmax to randomly generate discrete filter id and the other is followed by tanh to calculate the continuous parameters of the filter the critic network is followed by a fully connected layer to produce a value and a 2 has different continuous values according to each filter a 1 gamma exposure contrast tone color curve white balance saturation wnb 1 therefore the strategy of actor selection also consists of two parts 1 2 1 represents the probability distribution for each filter and 2 is the filter parameters which are generated by the actor network the critic network is in charge of evaluating the result our actor critic network consists of 5 convolutional layers and one fully connected layer shown in fig 6 the expected value of critic network is v s e r v s 2 in order to evaluate the strategy the value function is defined as follows q s a r a s v s 3 ieee transactions on multimedia vol 1 no 1 march 2021 6 the loss function in the critic network is defined as follows lc 1 n n i 1 a s a 2 4 where a s a is the monte carlo estimation of the optimiza tion function a s a q s a v s r v s v s 5 actor network chooses actions based on strategy to obtain more return values the objective of actor network is to maximize the la different from hu s work 31 we focus on personalized aesthetic enhancement for different users while introducing user interaction to achieve accurate extraction of user aesthetic preferences therefore in order to use small amount of user interaction to obtain satisfactory image retouching results we adopt the following strategy the enhancement policy network first trains a generic aesthetic enhancement model offline by extracting generic aesthetic features on the publicly available dataset and then online fine tunes this model using the images modified by user interaction b interactive personalized aesthetic ranking recently many approaches are proposed to solve the problem of image ranking the personalized image aesthetic ranking becomes even more challenging due to three following reasons 1 due to the high abstraction of image aesthetic features and user s aesthetic preferences the approach is required to have strong ability of aesthetic feature extraction 2 the existing public dataset highlights the popular aesthetics while there are some differences with the individual aesthetic preferences of different users 3 for personalized image aesthetic ranking the approach must be able to quickly learn different aesthetic preferences of different users with relatively small amount of data to address these challenges we introduce the deep q network dqn 50 to realize personalized image aesthetic ranking specifically we represent the sequence of images as continuous state features the movement of the image as continuous action features and use them as the input to dqn to predict the potential reward i e whether close to the real ranking by the user at the same time our approach can leverage large amounts of public aesthetic data and then quickly adapt to the different aesthetic preferences of different users by online fine tuning dqn meanwhile dqn is different from other machine learning methods it needs to constantly take action according to the feedback thus we propose to combine user interaction i e user reranks the images in the image sequence as feedback the dqn models the probability that a user may move a particular image in an image sequence and how to move it in the setting of dqn the similarity of image sequences and that provided by the user is essentially the reward available to the fig 7 deep reinforcement image aesthetic ranking at time t the agent receives the state st of image sequence from the environment the agent uses its policy network to choose an appropriate action a once a is executed the environment is transferred to the next step and the next status st 1 of image sequence is provided as well as the reward rt 1 at the same time the image sequence and feedback will be stored in memory the agent uses knowledge st at st 1 at 1 rt 1 in the memory to learn and improve its policy network agent therefore we can model the total reward as equation 6 rs a q s a rimmediate rfuture 6 where state s is represented by the current image sequence action a is represented by the position and the direction of movement of the image rimmediate represents the reward of the current situation i e the similarity between the current image sequence state and the final image sequence state and rfuture represents the estimated future rewards of the agent is a discount factor to balance the relative importance of immediate reward and future reward of action a specifically given s as the current state we use the strategy of double dqn 51 to predict the future total reward by taking action a at time t as in equation 7 rs a t ra t 1 q sa t 1 argmaxq sa t 1 a t t 7 where ra t 1 represents the immediate reward by taking action a t and t are two different sets of parameters of the policy network in this equation when action a is selected the agent will speculate the next state sa t 1 moreover the action a that gives the maximum future reward is selected on the next state sa t 1 based on t after this the estimated future reward for the given state sa t 1 is calculated based on t for each fixed number of iterations t will replace t this strategy has been proved to eliminate overly optimistic estimates of q 51 based on this our agent will be able to make decisions considering both immediate and future situations the deep reinforcement aesthetic ranking can be shown as fig 7 in this part the pool of users and images constitutes the environment and ranking policy network play the role of agent the state is defined as the representation of the image sequence and action is defined as the position and direction of movement for images at each interaction the state i e images sequence is pushed to the agent the agent will select ieee transactions on multimedia vol 1 no 1 march 2021 7 the best action i e the position and direction of movement and fetch interactive feedback as the reward specifically the reward is composed of the similarity of the image sequence all these image sequences and feedback log will be stored in the memory of the agent after certain fixed time the agent will extract the experience from memory to update its ranking policy network c personalized aesthetic distribution generation after obtaining the ranking sequence of personalized re touched images we turn to generate the personalized aesthetic distribution to match the user s aesthetic preferences how ever the personalized image aesthetic ranking mainly extracts deep implicit features from user specific images and does not highlight why users show these specific aesthetic preferences therefore we introduce the image aesthetic attribute classifier to complete the image aesthetic classification furthermore inspired by the multi label classification task we generate the user s personalized aesthetic distribution based on the ranking sequence of personalized retouched images the aesthetic attributes are used in this paper listed in table i once labeled by the well designed aesthetic attribute clas sifier images with multiple aesthetic attribute labels are pushed to our pre trained one vs all classifier to generate personalized aesthetic distributions the personalized aesthetic distribution is calculated by concatenating the specific distributions of all single styles as follows dugiar c i 1 rc i 1 rc c ai 8 where dugiar indicates the personalized distribution of user specific images rc is the ranking of c th image s distribution and ai represents the aesthetic score of i th image given new testing images we need to do the following two tasks at the same time to evaluate them 1 we push these testing images to the aesthetic attribute classifier to generate test distribution dtest then the prediction score is calculated by the correlation s between dugiar and dtest with equation iii c 2 we send them to users for watching and assessment and use the generated scores as the ground truth finally we can get the final result by comparing the prediction and the ground truth of users s dugiar dugiar n i 1 dtest dtest dugiar dugiar 2 n i 1 dtest dtest 2 9 where dtest represents the distribution of test images s represents the relative score between dugiar and dtest iv experiments in this section we extensively evaluate the performance of the proposed ug piaa on the two public datasets and compare them with other state of the art methods table i the chosen aesthetic attribute aesthetic attribute method aesthetic attribute method rule of

images and is rated by amateur photographers based on image aesthetic qualities each image is scored by an average of 200 people in response to photography contests and is associated with a single challenge theme with nearly 900 different contests in the ava the image ratings range from 1 to 10 the flickr aes dataset is downloaded from flickr 58 and consists of 40 000 images whose aesthetic levels are marked by amt the aesthetic levels range from the minimum of 1 to the maximum of 5 to reflect different levels of image aesthetics each image in this dataset is evaluated by five amt workers who participated in the flickr aes annotation process it should be noticed that the previous datasets are mainly suitable for generic image aesthetic assessment and enhance ment in contrast our approach mainly focuses on considering individual preference and learns the image aesthetic features of different users due to the high cost of data annotation and privacy previous datasets have too strict limitations to solve the personalized problem to obtain the personalized aesthetic assessment users need to retouch the images to produce the enhancement images according to their aesthetic preference considering that the high cost of collecting large scale personalized datasets and most of common people are not good at using the professional retouching software we provide a reliable online website to collect the personalized dataset of multiple users with different ages genders educational backgrounds etc users can use this platform to generate datasets that match their own aesthetic preferences which can be referred to at https zzuciisr github io ug piaa users can choose the images unlike to retouch maybe like or download like when dealing with the recommended images from flickr aes or ava dataset on the website once users choose to retouch the images they can use different operations to polish the images until they are satisfied with them and then save them during this stage to select representative attributes we investigate the mainstream image retouching software on mobile phones currently on the market and select the top eight operations for most of users after the retouched operations these images will be used as target images to guide the personalized automatic enhancement in the modification process we could get two scores one for the original image and the other for the retouched image users ieee transactions on multimedia vol 1 no 1 march 2021 8 can score the image from 1 and 10 in order to make this score more credible when the process of personalized collection ends users are allowed to score images in the second round based on the retouched images if the images have large score deviations they will be considered as invalid data finally we rank these images and use them to accomplish our experiment b experimental setting 1 user recruitment we select 60 volunteers from a variety of professions aged 20 to 45 to obtain user friendly dataset our system will automatically deliver images to volun teers from the dataset volunteers are asked to score the images and retouch images based on their preferences in contrast to usar 22 our model needs volunteers to retouch and rank the images the retouched and ranked images are pushed sequentially to the enhancement and ranking policy network in pairs once the images are pushed to the policy network the personalized automatic image enhancement policy network will be trained subsequently the enhanced image is used as the input of the ranking policy network and the ranking policy network is trained to finally generate a sequence of the ranked images this process requires multiple rounds of iterations 2 comparison metric to compare the existing giaa and piaa methods we compare the ranking correlation mea sured by spearman s between the predicted aesthetics scores and the ground truth aesthetics scores on the ava dataset suppose rk represents the k th ranking with the score sk and r k represents the ranking of the user according to the score s k subsequently dk rk r k is then substituted to 1 6 d 2 k n n 2 1 10 measures the difference between the two rankings n repre sents the number of images the coefficient lies in the range 1 1 3 our approach with different settings in order to study the effect of the image enhancement module on the distribution of personalized aesthetics we set up two sets of comparison experiments with or without image enhancement ranking without enhancement our ug piaa directly uses the public datasets for ranking and then uses the ranked images to generate aesthetic distributions finally we use the aesthetic distribution of images and ground truth to calculate the correlation between them ranking with enhancement since the personalized aes thetic features of the images can be improved by the automatic image enhancer more reliable personalized distribution of customized enhancement images will be received meanwhile we construct a personalized image collection platform for image aesthetic enhancement and image aesthetic assessment all workers are asked to rank and retouch the test images ac cording to their preferences for the generation of benchmark distribution users need to label the aesthetic attributes listed in table i c automatically personalized image enhancement in this section we will discuss

automatic enhancement images based on reinforcement learning are more in line with users aesthetic preferences ssim is used to measure the correlation of the outputs of user friendly enhancer and the ground truth of user s preference 2 different settings to thoroughly study and compare the automatic personalized image enhancement method in detail several different settings are implemented as follows and compared with other state of the art methods to study the impact of the few shot problem involved in the performance of personalized image aesthetic enhancement we select 5 10 15 20 30 and 40 images as the input data to fine tune the well pre trained model and called it as ours i where i 5 10 15 20 30 40 consequent operation depends on the current visual effect of the images during users retouch an image hence different filter combinations are applied to simulate the user s retouching image sequence the number of filters ranges from 3 7 which is written as ours j where j 3 4 5 6 7 3 results and discussion in order to enhance the im ages most of the existing methods that automatically beau tify images usually retouch the images by using a black box image enhancer or aesthetic rules in contrast to those methods we take into account the user s aesthetic preferences to achieve personalized enhanced images in this section we compare our results with the he histogram equalization 59 dhe dynamic histogram equalization 59 dped 33 abdullah et al 59 ying et al 34 feqe 60 agccwd 61 and son et al 62 to verity that our results are more in line with the users aesthetic preferences experiments show that our method works best in table ii to further explore the effect of the filters on the personal ized aesthetic enhancement module proposed in this paper we experimented the performance of the module by limiting the number of filters and that of input images and finally used these experimental results to select appropriate numbers in table iii it can be seen that when i 30 and j 5 the model describes the user s preferences most closely ssim is 0 6729 although the number of filters has been increased the performance of the model has not been promoted the experimental results are not only related to the number of filters but also related to the number of images these two factors need to be coordinated to make the experiment work perfectly therefore

that the model outperforms best when i 30 as the number of input increases more user aesthetic preference information can be obtained therefore the performance on i 30 outperforms that on i 5 10 15 20 however psychological research 63 shows that along with the increase of number of input the data quality will decrease because of the individual s aesthetic fatigue the performance on i 40 is generally worse than that on i 30 according to these results we set i 30 j 5 and compare our results with others on the ava dataset as detailed in section iv d d personalized image ranking results in

small number of user in teractions pa iaa introduces personality traits and multi task deep learning to the personalized image aesthetics assessment our approach achieves excellent performance with the addition of personalized image aesthetics enhancement the aesthetic distribution is limited if the user can only select satisfactory images in order to overcome this problem we encourage users to generate aesthetic attributes that may not exist in the dataset by adding retouched operations in the user interaction stage on the one hand the aesthetic distri bution can be optimized by adding new aesthetic attributes on the other hand it can highlight the user s personalized aesthetic preferences and avoid missing aesthetic attributes due to a small number of interactions the results show that using the personalized dataset can obtain more accurate personalized aesthetic expression 2 results and discussion on ava dataset the image ranking correlation and the image classification accuracy on the ava dataset are summarized in table v by adding the retouched operation in the user interaction stage the precision ieee transactions on multimedia vol 1 no 1 march 2021 10 fig 8 the heat map

fig 8 then the personalized aesthetic assessment will be more accurate the setting of ours ranking with enhancement outperforms best we further explore whether our approach can stabilize user preferences by limiting the parameters of n and t where n is the number of images pushed to the user during each interaction and t is the total number of interactions between ug piaa and the user based on this we use the data from different users in our established dataset and calculate the spearman s between the real user ranking and predicted individual ranking using the parameters of variation of n and t in table vi the table vi clearly shows that different parameters n and t have a certain influence on the results at the same time in order to further analyze how parameters n and t should be set during the interaction process we change the number of images pushed to users in each interaction process and count the average time spent by different users to complete all the retouching and ranking operations in the interaction process as table vii by analyzing the user s feedback of the retouching and ranking operations in the real interaction we have come to the following conclusion the impact of the different number of images on the user s retouching time is linear however when more images need to be ranked the time consumed by the user will increase exponentially during the ranking operation we notice that the real situation of users is that if the number of images doubles the user can not watch all images at a glance to get the final ranking result and needs to watch them several times to have a general judgment moreover when the number of images increases some users need to adjust the order of some images after the first ranking at the same time combined with the statistical data in table vi and table vii we comprehensively analyzed the accuracy of the aesthetic ranking and the time of the interaction process we concluded that the number of images pushed to the user during each interaction process should not be too much through a small number of interactions with enough times not only better accuracy can be obtained but also the interaction time can be minimized and the user s aesthetic fatigue can be reduced v conclusion in this paper we propose a novel user guided person alized image aesthetic assessment framework particularly personalized image aesthetic enhancement and user interaction are introduced into the aesthetic assessment to describe the aesthetic preferences of users and we explore their positive effects on personalized image aesthetic assessment extensive experimental results on the publicly available datasets demon strate the advancement and effectiveness of the method from two aspects 1 the proposed personalized image aesthetic ranking achieves outstanding results compared to the existing approaches 2 our approach achieves excellent performance in predicting the aesthetic preferences of various users and the ieee transactions on multimedia vol 1 no 1 march 2021 11 generated aesthetic distribution is closer to the real aesthetic distribution of users in future work it would be meaningful 1 we use the flickr aes and ava dataset for training to realize the image aesthetic enhancement and ranking but there is still large gap compared to the 1 4 107 images used for image classification in imagenet in the future we will consider how to transfer the knowledge extracted from imagenet to solve the aesthetic problem or generate another massive datasets of high quality aesthetics enhancement and assessment images in an automatic way 2 our experiments verify the positive effect of personalized aesthetic enhancement on personalized aesthetic evaluation and we believe that using more powerful personalized aesthetic enhancement measures e g optimizing the image composition will achieve better results references 1 h tong m li h j zhang j he and c zhang classification
