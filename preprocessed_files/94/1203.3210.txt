yerramalli rahul jain ubli usc edu abstract this paper is eligible for the student paper award the behavior of rational and selfish play ers receivers over a multiple input multiple output gaussian broadcast channel is investigated using the framework of non cooperative game theory in contrast to the game theoretic model of the gaussian multiple access channel where the set of feasible actions for each player is independent of other players actions the strategies of the players in the broadcast channel are mutually coupled usually by a sum power or joint covariance constraint and hence cannot be treated using traditional nash equilibrium solution concepts to characterize the strategic behavior of receivers connected to a single transmitter this paper models the broadcast channel as a generalized nash equilibrium problem with coupled constraints the concept of normalized equilibrium noe is used to characterize the equilibrium points and the existence and uniqueness of the noe are proven for key scenarios i introduction we consider a multiple input multiple output mimo gaussian broadcast channel gbc in which a single trans mitter is assigned to send independent messages to several re ceivers subject to a sum power constraint or a joint covariance constraint our goal is to introduce a game theoretic model for signaling over the gbc to model strategic non cooperative be havior among receivers who are the players in the game such a model allows us to predict the operating point of a broadcast channel e g finding the equilibrium precoding matrices and enables the development of distributed algorithms to achieve this operating point in a typical non cooperative game the choice of an action by a player affects the utility obtained by every player but does not change the set of available actions for other players several game theoretic models for signaling over wireless channels adopt this framework for characterizing the interaction between rational or selfish nodes see 1 2 for a detailed survey for example the gaussian multiple access channel mac has been studied extensively under this framework 3 6 in practice we encounter several scenarios in which the choice of actions of one player may modify the set of feasible choices for every other player 7 8 for example in 9 the problem of maintaining a minimum rate over parallel gaussian interference channels subject to a sum power constraint for each user is considered the choice of power allocation of a player for a given interference channel is this research has been funded in part by the following grants and orga nizations nsf ccf 0917343 nsf iis 0917410 career cns 0954116 onr n 00014 09 1 0700 nsf cns 0832186 nsf ccf 1117896 and nsf cns 082175 then also influenced by the choice of power allocation by other players on other interference channels to maintain an overall desired rate and hence is a game with coupled constraints for the gaussian broadcast channel the choice of precoding covariance matrix for one of the receivers restricts the choice of precoding matrices for all other receivers due to the joint power or covariance constraints interaction of players at the level of feasible sets makes the problem much harder than standard non cooperative games the problem of determining the equilibrium points of games with coupled constraints is called the generalized nash equilibrium problem gnep 1 7 9 and the points themselves are called generalized nash equilibria gne from a game theoretic perspective the broadcast channel has received very little attention as compared to other channels such as the mac a discrete memoryless broadcast channel with 2 users and a resource manager was considered in 10 and impact of the information available to the resource manager in modifying utility of each user is studied the main contributions of this paper are the following 1 we model the interaction between selfish receivers getting data over a gbc with the transmitter employing dirty paper coding or linear precoding as a gnep the transmitter computes the precoding matrix for the message intended for each receiver and the precoding matrices are constrained by a common joint constraint 2 we first show that there exists at least one gne for the broadcast channel in fact it is well know that under mild conditions there may exist infinitely many gnes for a given gnep 7 8 games in which each player has the same coupled constraints such as in the broadcast channel game belong to a special class whose gnes can be characterized with weight vectors the gnes of this special class first defined by rosen 7 are called normalized equilibrium noe points 3 using rosen s methodology we show that for every feasible weight vector there exists at least one noe 4 for the special case of the aligned and degraded broadcast channel 11 we first derive a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of noes as was done in 5 for the multi antenna gaussian mac see also 7 and then 5 determine the set of weight vectors for which the noe is unique the rest of the paper is organized as follows section ii briefly introduces the model for the broadcast channel and presents several game theoretic definitions and preliminaries useful for the rest of the paper section iii discuss the existence and uniqueness of gnes and section iv concludes this paper http arxiv org abs 1203 3210 v 1 ii signal model and preliminaries in this section we describe the signal model and state several game theoretic concepts used throughout this paper a broadcast channel model consider a general multiuser multi input multi output mimo system with one transmitter and k receivers we first define several classes of broadcast channels which are simplified models of the gbc we use the terminology from 11 herein the transmitted signal is denoted by x a vector of length t where t is the number of antennas at the transmitter tx this tx signal is the sum of independent xi each drawn from a gaussian codebook and intended for the ith receiver rx x k i 1 xi xi n 0 qi 1 the signal at the ith rx can be expressed as y i hix ni n n 0 k i 1 ni 2 where hi is the ri t channel gain matrix from the tx to the ith rx and ri is the number of antennas at the i th rx without loss of generality we assume that transmitter signaling is constrained by a covariance matrix s 0 such that e xxt k i 1 qi s 3 the scenario with a sum power constraint i e can be similarly modeled as tr e xxt ptot 4 where ptot is the maximum transmit sum power for all the antennas for simplicity of illustration we only consider the covariance matrix constraint in this paper all the results derived are also valid for sum power constraint as well we now define a special class of broadcast channels which are simplified versions of the general gbc 11 1 ambc a mimo bc is called aligned if the number of transmit antennas is equal to the number of antennas at each of the receivers t r 1 r 2 rk and the channel gain matrices are all identity matrices hi it t 2 adbc a mimo bc is called aligned and degraded if the bc is aligned and the covariances of the gaussian noise at the receiver are ordered such that 0 n 1 n 2 nk where a b implies that b a is a positive semi definite matrix b generalized nash equilibrium problems 1 definition formally a gnep consists of k players with each player controlling the variables qk qk are positive semi definite covariance matrices in our problem each player has an objective function vk which depends on qk as well as the controlling variables of all other players denoted by q k we denote the utility function by vk qk q k or vk q q q 1 q 2 qk to emphasize the dependence on the controlling variables and will be called the utility function of the kth player for the rest of this paper given the strategies q k picked by all other players the set of feasible actions of the kth player determined by the joint constraints is given by a q k and this is the feasible set or the strategy space of the kth player we emphasize that the set ak q k is a function of the strategies of the other players each player given the strategies of all other players picks a strategy that solves the maximization problem max qk vk qk q k subject to qk ak q k 5 let bk q k denote the set of all the solutions for this maximization problem the gnep is the problem of finding q k such that q k b q k for all k 1 2 k 6 define b q ki 1 b q i in other words the gnep is to find a fixed point q such that q b q and q solves the maximization in 5 such a point is called a generalized nash equilibrium gne or a solution to the gnep a point q q 1 q k is therefore an equilibrium if no player can increase his objective function by unilaterally changing qk to any other feasible point 2 discussion a gnep usually has multiple or even infinitely many solutions 7 a special class of gneps called gnep with shared common constraints was defined by rosen 7 this class is characterized by dependent constraints that are common to all the players and our paper herein considers a problem belonging to this class rosen proposed a solution concept called the normalized equilibrium noe to characterize gnep belonging to this class the noe is a gne for which the lagrange multipliers shadow prices associated with the shared constraints are equal among all players up to constant factors and its uniqueness is guaranteed under appropriate conditions 7 gnes are not self enforceable like a nash equilibrium as it is not feasible to assume that each player picks his strategy independently and the selected strategies satisfy the coupled constraints however gnes have significant explana tory power and capture the characteristics of several real world problems as will be demonstrated later c concave games existence and uniqueness of normalized equilibrium points definition 1 a game is said to be concave if the set of allowed strategies of all the players is a convex set the utility functions are concave in each players control variables and continuous in the control variables of all other players let us denote by f the set of jointly feasible strategies of the players and by fi the projection of f on the space from which the control variables for the ith player come from then f f 1 f 2 fk with equality satisfied when the control variables do not have any joint constraints let us define the function f p q r k i 1 rivi q 1 qi 1 pi qi 1 qk 7 for a fixed vector r r 1 r 2 rk r k the k tuple q q 1 q k is a normalized equilibrium point if q satisfies the equivalent fixed point condition q argmax p f p q r 8 where the maximization is carried out over the convex set f for concave games the existence of a normalized equilib rium point is guaranteed by theorem 3 in 7 for all vectors r in the positive orthant note that for any given value of r there could be multiple normalized equilibrium points we now state the conditions for the uniqueness of the noes 1 uniqueness of normalized equilibrium points let q r k i 1 rivi qi q i ri 0 9 be a weighted sum of the utilities of each player where q are the control variables for all the players and r is a vector containing a set of weights definition 2 the function g q r r 1 1 v 1 q 1 q 1 r 2 2 v 2 q 2 q 2 rk kvk qk q k 10 where i is the derivative w r t the i th players control vari ables is called the pseudo gradient of q r definition 3 vector valued strategies 7 the function x r is called diagonally strictly concave dsc in vector valued strategies for x f and a fixed r rk if for every x 0 x 1 f we have x 1 x 0 t g x 0 r x 0 x 1 t g x 1 r 0 11 from theorem 4 in 7 we know that for vector valued strategies if x r is dsc for every r r where r is a convex subset of the positive orthant then for each r r the noe is unique definition 4 matrix valued strategies 5 the function q r is called dsc in matrix valued strategies for q f and a fixed r rk if for every q 0 q 1 f we have tr q 1 q 0 t g q 0 r q 0 q 1 t g q 1 r 0 12 we also show that if for matrix valued strategies the dsc condition is satisfied for every r r then the noe is unique for that r r iii the broadcast channel as a generalized nash equilibrium problem a model of the game as mentioned previously the broadcast channel has a single tx sending data to several rxs over the wireless channel the receivers are the players of this game and it can be assumed that a fictitious agent of each rx is located at the tx plays and the game on behalf of the rx we assume gaussian codebooks are used for communication and each rx s control variable is the covariance matrix qi of the signal xi intended for that receiver rxi all these players are constrained by a joint covariance constraint given by k i 1 qi s thus it is clear that the dependent constraints are common to each player and hence this game belongs to the special class of gneps which can be characterized by noe points we consider both linear precoding 12 and dirty paper coding dpc 11 based encoding schemes at the tx for the dpc we also assume a fixed encoding order at the tx without time sharing between orders each player obtains a rate the game utility based on the choice of actions of all other players and the tx for a general gbc if the data streams are linearly precoded at the tx with covariance matrices qi the utility function rate achievable of the kth player can be written as 12 vk qk q k log ni hi k i 1 qi h h i ni hi i 6 k qi h h i 13 similarly if the data streams are coded using dpc with encoding order k k 1 1 then the utility function of the kth player can be written as 11 vk qk q k log ni hi k i 1 qi h h i ni hi k 1 i 1 qi h h i 14 it is easy to see that the utilities of the kth player vk qk q k in 13 and 13 are concave in qk and continuous in the control variables of all the other players b existence of normalized equilibrium points proposition 1 the broadcast channel game with linear pre coding or dpc is a concave game and hence for each weight vector in the positive orthant r r 1 r 2 rk r k there exists at least one normalized equilibrium point proof each players control variable in the broadcast channel game is the signaling covariance matrix qi by definition qi 0 in addition the sum power constraint or the joint covariance constraint ensure that the set of jointly feasible strategies is compact and convex the kth players utility is concave in qk and is continuous in q k and hence the broadcast channel game is a concave game from theorem 3 of 7 we know that a concave game has at least one noe for every weight vector r rk c uniqueness of normalized equilibrium points we now derive the condition for the uniqueness of the equilibrium points we start by assuming that for a given r rk there exist multiple equilibrium points and then arrive at a contradiction which proves the uniqueness proposition 2 the sufficient condition for the uniqueness of the normalized nash equilibrium for a given weight vector r is given as tr q q t g q r q i q i g q r 0 15 proof let q q 1 q 2 q k and q q 1 q 2 q k be two k tuples of covariance matrices which are normalized equilibria to the game characterized by the weight vector r we know from 8 that f q q r maxp f f p q r and f q q r maxp f f p q r writing the karush kuhn tucker kkt conditions 13 for the two equilibria yields a q i q i 0 i 1 2 k b k i 1 q i s and k i 1 q i s c tr l iq i 0 and tr l iq i 0 d tr d k i 1 q i s 0 e tr d k i 1 q i s 0 f ri ivi q l i d 0 g ri ivi q l i d 0 now multiplying f and g with q i q i and q i q i respectively summing on i and taking the trace we get 0 k i 1 tr q i q i ri ivi q l i d k i 1 tr q i q i ri ivi q l i d k i 1 tr q i q i ri ivi q q i q i ri ivi q k i 1 tr q i q i l i d q i q i l i d 16 re arranging and evaluating the second term tr k i 1 q i q i d l i d l i c tr k i 1 q id q id q il i q id q il i q id d e tr sd sd tr i q id i q id tr i q il i q il i a tr s i q i d tr s i q i d b 0 17 we have shown that 0 and hence for 0 we need that 0 now k i 1 tr q i q i ri ivi q q i q i ri ivi q tr q q t g q r q i q i g q r 18 this condition is exactly the dsc condition defined in section ii if for the broadcast channel game we have that 0 for some r then we have arrived at a contradiction and hence there cannot exist multiple noe for that r for all such r 0 is a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of the noe note that we have derived the sufficient condition for uniqueness of the noe for the broadcast channel game with joint covariance constraints we state without proof that the dsc condition with matrix valued strategies holds for a more general scenarios for example sum power or per antenna power constraint or other common constraints and is not restricted to the broadcast channel problem see 7 for a discussion on how the dsc condition with vector valued strategies holds for concave games in general we now consider special cases for the broadcast channel and determine which values of r result in unique noes we first state two trace inequalities that will be used to derive the uniqueness results lemma 1 14 for any positive integer k and a set of posi tive semi definite matrices a 1 a 2 ak and b 1 b 2 bk such that a 1 0 and b 1 0 we have that tr k k 1 ak bk k l 1 bl 1 k l 1 al 1 0 19 note that the set of inequalities may not be the tightest trace inequalities for example for k 2 and any positive real number w it has been shown in 15 that tr a 1 b 1 b 1 1 a 1 1 4 a 2 b 2 wb 1 b 2 1 wa 1 a 2 1 0 20 clearly there is much room for deriving generalizations of such inequalities and such generalizations will improve the characterization of the unique noes we restrict our attention to the above known inequalities in this paper d uniqueness results for normalized nash equilibrium points proposition 3 for the aligned and degraded broadcast channel adbc with dirty paper coding at the transmitter and interference canceling receivers a unique normalized equilibrium point exists for r 1 r 2 rk 0 proof for the adbc the utility obtained by the kth receiver is given by 11 vk qk q k log k i 1 qi nk k 1 i 1 qi nk 21 for this utility function we now show that 0 and thus determine the unique noes let q 1 q 2 q k and q 1 q 2 q k be any two tuples of covariance matrices which satisfy the covariance constraint k i 1 q i s and k i 1 q i s substituting the utility obtained when using the two sets of covariances in the dsc condition we get tr k k 1 rk q k q k kvk q kvk q 22 tr k k 1 rk q k q k nk k i 1 q i 1 nk k i 1 q i 1 k 1 n 1 rn rn 1 tn rktk 23 where the term tn can be expressed as tr n k 1 q k q k nk k i 1 q i 1 nk k i 1 q i 1 24 it is now sufficient to show that tn 0 notice that the structure of tn closely resembles the inequality in 19 choose the quantities a 1 n 1 q 1 b 1 n 1 q 1 ai ni ni 1 q i and bi ni ni 1 q i by definition since n 1 is a positive definite matrix and q 1 q 1 are positive semi definite the matrices a 1 and b 1 are strictly positive definite from the degradedness of the channel we get that ni ni 1 is a positive semi definite matrix and hence ai and bi are positive semi definite for i 2 k substituting the values of ai and bi in eq 19 it is straight forward to see that tn 0 for an adbc channel having identity channel matrices we know from 5 that if the noes q 6 q then tn 0 and hence the normalized equilibrium points of the adbc game as unique for r 1 r 2 rk 0 it is clear that the region of weight vectors r for which uniqueness can be shown is dependent on the tightness of the matrix trace inequalities for k 2 the inequality in 19 has been improved to the inequality in 20 thus for the 2 user adbc the uniqueness can be derived for a more general set of weight vectors lemma 2 for a 2 user adbc with dirty paper coding at the transmitter and interference canceling receivers a unique normalized equilibrium point exists for r 1 r 2 4 0 proof the proof follows exactly on the lines of lemma 3 with the dsc condition decomposing into two terms given by r 1 r 2 4 t 1 and r 2 4 t 2 now using the inequality in 20 with w 1 it is easy to show that there exists a unique normalized equilibrium point for each point in the region r 1 r 2 4 0 e discussion we have characterized the unique noes of the adbc above uniqueness of the noes ensures that each there exists a single reasonable outcome for the broadcast channel game and simplifies the development of algorithms to compute noes we also note that the proof of uniqueness makes explicit use of the degradedness of the broadcast channel and hence cannot be directly extended to the ambc and the general gbc characterizing the uniqueness of the noes for the ambc and the gbc and computation of these equilibria 9 is currently being investigated iv conclusions strategic behavior among rational non cooperative receivers in a gaussian broadcast channel has not been studied so far in literature in this paper we presented a game theoretic model for the general gaussian broadcast channel and showed that it belongs to the special class of generalized nash equilibrium problems with common dependent constraints we showed the existence of the normalized equilibrium points the solutions of the gnep with coupled constraints for the gaussian broadcast channel with dirty paper coding and linear precoding strate gies in general there exist multiple equilibrium points for a gnep we then derived a sufficient condition to determine the unique normalized equilibrium points and characterized the uniqueness of these points for the special case of an aligned and degraded broadcast channel references 1 g scutari d p palomar f facchinei and j s pang convex optimization game theory and variational inequality
