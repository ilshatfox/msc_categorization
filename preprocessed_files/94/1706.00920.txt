sica buenos aires argentina and consejo nacional de investigaciones cient ficas y te cnicas buenos aires argentina l rebo n departamento de f sica iflp universidad nacional de la plata c c 67 1900 la plata argentina dated october 30 2021 we propose a method for preparing mixed quantum states of arbitrary dimension d d 2 which are codified in the discretized transverse momentum and position of single photons once they are sent through an aperture with d slits following our previous technique we use a programmable single phase only spatial light modulator slm to define the aperture and set the complex trans mission amplitude of each slit allowing the independent control of the complex coefficients that define the quantum state since these slms give us the possibility to dynamically varying the complex coefficients of the state during the measurement time we can generate not only pure states but also quantum states compatible with a mixture of pure quantum states therefore by using these apertures varying on time according to a probability distribution we have experimentally obtained d dimensional quantum states with purities that depend on the parameters of the distri bution through a clear analytical expression this fact allows us to easily customize the states to be generated moreover the method offer the possibility of working without changing the optical setup between pure and mixed states or when the dimensionality of the states is increased the obtained results show a quite good performance of our method at least up to dimension d 11 being the fidelity of the prepared states f 0 98 in every case i introduction in quantum optics pure quantum states of single pho tons have been widely explored both theoretically and experimentally they can be generated controlled and measured using the several degrees of freedom of a pho ton and by means of different techniques 1 3 however a quantum system is not in general in a pure state be cause of experimental imperfections or interactions with the environment we have only partial knowledge of its physical state and it cannot be described through a well defined vector in the hilbert space for that rea son the most general description of a quantum system is given by a mixture of pure quantum states that can be matematicaly expressed by the formalism of the den sity matrix 4 in consequence the progress in the study of quantum systems and their potentialities for practical applications relies on the ability for controlling mixed states and not only pure states for instance the abil ity for engineering and measuring mixed quantum states allows to experimentally study how quantum comput ing algorithms and quantum communication protocols are affected by decoherence 5 6 besides beyond the original model for quantum information 7 8 based in unitary gates operating on pure quantum states alter native models based on mixed quantum states have been developed 9 10 these models also give the possibility to perform some tasks not realizable with a comparable classical system 11 14 moreover as the system is ini miguel df uba ar tially in a mixed quantum state and entanglement is not the required physical resource they are less restrictive more robust against noise and easier to implement than the standard quantum information model controllable generation of mixed quantum states has been successfully proposed in earlier works mainly using the polarization degree of freedom to codified the state 15 18 while these methods are relatively simple to implement they only allow the realization of two level systems otherwise higher dimensional quantum states namely qudits d level quantum systems increase the quantum complexity without increasing the number of particles involved for instance systems of dimension d 2 n can be used to simulate a composite system of n qubits 19 for quantum communication protocols d dimensional quantum channels show higher capacity and provide better security againts an eavesdropper 20 22 moreover multi level information carriers are crucial to reduce the number of gates required in the circuits for quantum computing 23 among the feasible degrees of freedom for encod ing high dimensional quantum systems 24 27 the dis cretized transverse momentum position of single photons have attracted particular interest they have proven useful for several application such as quantum infor mation protocols 28 29 quantum games 30 quan tum algorithms 31 and quantum key distribution 32 the encoding process is achieved by sending the pho tons through an aperture with d slits which sets the qudits dimension 33 more sophisticated methods to generate these so called spatial qudits take advantage of liquid crystal displays lcds as programmable spatial ar x iv 1 70 6 00 92 0 v 1 qu an t ph 3 j un 2 01 7 mailto miguel df uba ar 2 light modulators slms these programmable optical devices can be used to define a set of independent d slits with complex transmission in this way it is possi ble to produce and measure arbitrary pure qudits with out any extra physical alignment of the optical compo nents 19 34 36 recently lemos et al 37 have characterized the ac tion of an slm as a noisy quantum channel acting on a polarization qubit and they used it for implementing a phase flip channel with a controllable degree of decoher ence in ref 38 marques et al extended the use of the slms to simulate the open dynamics of a d dimensional quantum system by using films instead of images in this paper we present a method to generate ar bitrary spatial mixed states of d dimension d 2 which is based in the techniques developed in our previ ous works 35 36 we have extended these techniques to consider a d slits with a variable complex transmission the use of a programmable slm makes it possible to dy namically modify the complex transmission in order to obtain a mixed qudit state by averaging the sample over the time the paper is organized as follows in section ii we give the mathematical description of a single photon state when it is sent trough an aperture with a time varying transmission function by considering that we can vary the relative phase values of the complex transmission fol lowing an uniform probability distribution we have de rived simple analytical expressions which show the de pendence between the distribution widths and the purity of the state for any dimension d from these expressions it is possible to obtain any degree of purity by continu ously varying the the distribution widths which allows us to use the same method for preparing pure and mixed states in section iii a it is described the experimental set up and it is explained how a first slm is addressed to generate the states while a second slm is employed to encode the measurement bases used to perform the to mographic reconstruction of the system in section iii b it is reported a first experiment consisting in the genera tion and measurement of pure qudit states it was carried on in order to test the set up and the proposed methods afterwards in section iii c we implement the variable transmission function for generating mixed states with different degree of purity in dimensions d 2 3 7 and 11 finally the results are presented in section iv and discussed before go into the conclusions ii formalism let us to start by considering the generation of a spa tial qudit in a pure state a paraxial and monochromatic single photon field is transmitted through an aperture described by a complex transmission function a x as suming an initial pure state it is transformed as dx x 1 x a x dx x a x 1 x 1 where x x y is the transverse position coordinate and x is the normalized transverse probability amplitude for this state i e dx x 2 1 we are interested in generating an incoherent mixture of pure states by varying the transmission function of the aperture over time so let us consider that a x t is an array of d 2 rectangular slits of width 2 a period d and length l a d where each slit has a transmission amplitude t a x a x t rect x l d 1 0 t rect y d 2 a 2 with d 1 2 thus instantaneously at any time t a pure state t is obtained whereas in a finite period of time t an en semble of these pure states is created in consequence the result after a measurement process is the ensemble average over the integration time t whose statistics cor responds to a mixed state described by the density matrix 4 1 t t 0 dt t t dx dx x x 1 x 1 x 3 where x x x x 1 t t 0 dta x t a x t hence the state of the photon in eq 3 can be writ ten as d 1 0 c 4 where denotes the state of the photon passing through the slit 26 the states satisfy the condition ll and they are used to define the logical base for spatial qudits the quantum state of the system is determined by the coefficients c 1 t t 0 dt t t which carry the information codify in the transfer func tion a x t in principle given that in the most gen eral case the transmission amplitudes t are complex values we could introduce the time dependence either in the modulus t or in the argument arg t and even in both however as it is well known phase information plays a more important role than real ampli tude in signal processing 39 so we can get full control of the state by varying only the phases see sec iii c for a complete discussion then for a time dependent 3 phase t the transmission for the slit is written as t e i t and the complex coefficients in the mixture in eq 4 are given by the expression c d 1 j 0 2 j c 5 with c 1 t t 0 dt e i t e i t 6 to define this state we have proposed that the phase of each slit varies according to a probabilistic distribu tion if the time t is much longer than the characteristic time where the phase varies the integration in the time domain can be replaced by an integration in the phase domain in fact we can assume that for a period of time long enough t reaches all its possible val ues with a frequency of occurrence given by a probability distribution f in addition if the phase of each slit varies independently of the other ones the joint probability distribution is obtained as f f 0 1 d 1 f 0 f 1 f d 1 7 according to this scheme the complex coefficients in eq 6 turn into c d f e i e i 8 from this expression we directly obtain c 1 0 1 d 1 and c c 0 1 d 1 imply ing that the diagonal elements of the density matrix eq 4 which denote the probabilities to find the system in one of the pure quantum states are real valued coef ficients in the interval 0 1 and as expected the density matrix is hermitian as only the relative phases but not the absolute val ues in the linear combination that define the quantum state are relevant we have indistinctly fixed the phase value of one of the slit 0 to be 0 0 then the corresponding probability distribution in eq 7 is the dirac delta function 0 besides we have assumed that f is a uniform distribution of width and cen tered in 1 d 1 in this way the joint probability distribution is f n 0 d 1 1 rect 9 n 1 d 1 j 1 j therefore the statistical mixture which describe the state of the transmitted photon will be completely de termined by the real amplitudes the phases and the distribution widths which can be completely and independently controlled in our experimental setup see sec iii a even more it is straightforward to obtain the purity of the state p tr 2 p z 2 d 1 i 0 4 i 2 z 2 d 2 i 0 d 1 j i 2 i 2 j sinc i 2 2 sinc j 2 2 10 being the normalization constant z d 1 i 0 2 i 1 from this equation eq 10 it becomes clear how to generate a qudit state with an arbitrary purity by set ting up the experimental parameters in particular the maximal mixed state p 1 d is obtained when the real coefficients have all of them the same value and the phases can reach any value between 0 and 2 with the same probability i e 2 1 d 1 on the other hand if 0 1 d 1 i e when the phase of each slit remains constant over the time t the terms sinc 2 are equal to 1 in such a case the purity of the state tends to 1 as expected for a pure quantum state thus the scheme discussed here is reduced to the previous ones presented in refs 35 and 36 for prepar ing arbitrary pure spatial qudits let us consider as example the preparation of qubit states because of their simplicity they are helpful to understand the general behaviour of the scheme in this case d 2 we explicitly obtain c 01 1 1 1 12 1 1 2 d 1 e i 1 e i 1 sinc 1 2 11 the diagonal coefficients of the density matrix are inde pendent of the phase probability distribution since as was mentioned before c 1 while the rest of coeffi cients can be obtained by complex conjugation there fore these states are described by the density matrix 1 20 2 1 20 0 1 e i 1 sinc 1 2 0 1 e i 1 sinc 1 2 21 they have a purity given by p 40 4 1 2 2 0 2 1 sinc 2 1 2 20 2 1 2 12 4 and any degree of purity can be achieved by controlling the relation 1 0 and 1 in the next section we described our technique devel oped for implementing these concepts and illustrate with the generation of mixed states in different dimensions d iii experimental implementation a experimental set up the experimental setup used for the generation and reconstruction of the spatial qudit states is shown schematically in fig 1 the first part consists in a 4 f optical system with a spatial filter in the fourier plane a 405 nm laser diode beam is expanded filtered and collimated in order to illuminate the spatial light modu lator slm 1 with a planar wave with approximately con stant phase and amplitude distribution over the region of interest this modulator is used to represent the spa tial qudit according with the techniques described in 35 36 these methods allows us to generate pure spatial qudits with arbitrary complex coefficients by us ing only one pure phase modulator the coefficient mod ulus see sec ii is given by the phase modulation of the diffraction gratings displayed on each slit region the argument can be defined either by adding a con stant phase value 35 or by means of a lateral displace ment of the gratings 36 both methods have a good performance being the latter one developed to reduce the effects of the phase fluctuations present in modern liquid crystal on silicon lcos displays 40 in par ticular the phase modulators used in our experiment are conformed by a sony liquid crystal television panel lctv model lcx 012 bl in combination with polarizers and wave plates that provide the adequate state of light polarization to reach a phase modulation near 2 41 42 as this device is free of phase fluctuations the first cod ification method was implemented given that it avoids the phase quantization required in the second scheme the spatial filter sf 2 is used to select the first orders diffracted by the mentioned gratings in such a way that on the back focal plane of lens l 2 is obtained the complex distribution that represents the spatial qudit fig 1 experimental setup o is a expansor sfi are spatial filters li are lenses slmi are spatial light modulators and d is a single pixel detector on the same plane which is also coincident with the front focal plane of l 3 is placed the second modulator slm 2 on which are represented the reconstruction bases m used to implement the quantum state tomogra phy process 19 these bases are also displayed as slits and its complex amplitudes are codified by following the previously described method the measurements that allow characterizing the quantum state are performed by means of a single pixel detector placed at the back focal plane of l 3 and a spatial filter sf 3 used to select the center of the interference pattern produced by the slits it is worth to mention that the proposed architecture performs the exact fourier transform at each stage and avoid the introduction of spurious phases through the propagation process b generation of pure states in order to test the implementation of the encoding method in our optical set up and optimize the alignment process we started by preparing and reconstructing pure quantum states the generation of pure states is achieved by representing the state on the slm 1 as we ex plained in sec iii a the tomographic process is carried out by means of projective measurements that allow re constructing the density matrix in eq 4 we rep resent the reconstruction basis m on the slm 2 and take the number of counts in the center of the fourier plane as the value of the proyection p m m 2 we use mutually unbiased basis which require d d 1 projections and reconstruct the density as 43 d 1 1 d m 1 p m m m i 13 to quantify the quality of the whole experiment we used the fidelity f tr between the state intended to be prepared and the density matrix of the state actually prepared 44 ideally it is desirable to have f 1 we have tested the system for different hilbert space dimensions with excellent results as an example the reconstruction results obtained for d 11 are shown in fig 2 to this end we have generated 500 pure states ei l with an arbitrary phase uniformly distributed between 0 and 2 the mean fidelity is f 0 992 with standard deviation 0 003 the sys tem proved to be reliable for the generation and recon struction of pure qudits in different dimensions c generation of mixed states the mixed states generation is achieved by means a statistical mixture of pure states this can be per formed by varying the modulus t and or phases 5 fig 2 fidelity occurrence for qudits states with d 11 there are represented 500 arbitrary states d 1 0 ei the mean fidelity is f 0 992 and the stan dard deviation is 0 003 t of the states represented on slm 1 while the mea surement process is carried on as previously mentioned in sec ii in general many of the important features of a signal are preserved when only the phase is retained re gardless of the amplitude 39 in order to verify this asser tion in our case we studied first by numerical simulation the effect of varying separately these magnitudes we started by keeping constant the amplitudes and chang ing the phases with a uniform probability distribution centered on a mean phase value and with a width the purity of the states are determined by the width as is stated in eq 10 the highest incoherence is achieved when 2 for each slit and narrower widths lead to greater coherence between slits as pure states are added to the mixture purity converges to a steady value as an example in fig 3 it is shown the purity evolution as a function of the number of pure states used to generate a mixed state of dimension d 2 the evo lution is depicted for different width distributions we can observe that there is a stabilization afterwards 250 pure states were used to generate the mixture a simi lar behaviour was observed for higher dimensions d see supplementary material 45 following the same technique for generating mixed states we also tested the purity evolution of the states by varying the real amplitudes instead of the phases we have observed that the convergence to a steady purity value is obtained after adding at least 500 pure states in the mixture besides independently of which distribu tion width is considered it is not possible to achieved the lowest purity value summarizing phase variation results the best option in order to generate mixed states iv results in this section are presented and analyzed the results obtained for mixed states ranging from dimension d 2 fig 3 purity evolution for qubits as a function of the num ber of states composing the statistical mixture and different probability distribution widths 1 we note that after 250 pure states were used to generate the mixture the purity be haviour stabilizes and it achieves its final value to d 11 let us start with the mixed qubits case we have generated states with three different relative amplitudes of the two slits 0 and 1 and diverse width distributions of the phase variations 1 the purity of the states p as a function of these magnitudes is shown in fig 4 in every case the experimental values of purity matches very well with the theoretical behaviour described by equation 12 for 1 2 in the case of 0 1 represented with circles it is possible to reach the lowest purity for qu dits p 1 2 however in the cases where 0 2 1 crosses and 0 3 1 squares the lowest purity ob tained is higher than in the first case in fact the value of purity defined by eq 12 is function of 0 1 and 1 and the lowest purity achievable is when 0 1 and 1 2 fig 4 purity of qubits in function of the probability distri bution width 1 for different relative amplitudes 0 and 1 the solid line represents the theoretical values according to eq 12 in case of qutrits d 3 we have generated sev eral mixed states a particular situation is illustrated in 6 fig 5 it shows the purity of these states as a function of the probability width 1 of the second slit for different widths 2 fixed on the second slit the relative ampli tudes between slits are 0 1 2 in the case of 2 2 circles the lowest possible purity p 1 3 is reached for 1 2 lower values of 2 in this case 2 crosses and 2 0 plus signs leads to higher purities the situation becomes trivial for 1 2 0 when it is obtained a pure state p 1 fig 5 purity of d 3 qudits in function of the probability distribution width 1 for different fixed width 2 the rel ative amplitude are 0 1 2 the solid line represents the theoretical values according to eq 10 for d 7 we illustrate the case with two different mixed states which density matrices are shown in fig 6 for both states the amplitudes of the slits are equal i e 0 1 6 on the left side it is shown the case of lowest coherence between slits obtained when 2 for every slit it can be seen that the diago nal elements on the real part the system populations are equal and different of zero while the off diagonal el ements the system coherences are null on the right side is shown the density matrix of a state which slit co herences are governed by probability distribution widths that follow a lineal dependence with the slit label that is 2 7 it can be noted that the system populations remain equal like in the previous case but the system coherences decrease as the slit label increases these ex amples show that by means of the proposed method it is possible to modify the coherence between the slits in an arbitrary way in the case d 11 we present two mixed states with different coherences among slits fig 7 shows the real left and imaginary right part of an incoherent state and thus with minimal purity all the relative ampli tudes are equal and the phase distribution widths are 2 fig 7 a show the reconstructed density ma trix by mixing 250 pure states fig 7 b show simulated results using the same 250 states and fig 7 c are the theoretical density matrix the fidelity beetween exper imental and simulated density matrices is reported as f 0 9886 the reported purities are p exp 0 1201 and p sim 0 1177 for experimental and simulated density matrix respectively in this case the lowest pu rity for a d 11 state is p theo 1 11 0 0909 we note that the agreement between experimental and sim ulated results are excellent the theoretical value corre spond to a mixture of infinite pure states and this is the reason for not having reached the maximum incoherence in the supplementary material 45 it is shown a dynami cal evolution from the initial pure state to the final mixed state same as in the case d 7 for d 11 we have gen erated a mixed state with arbitrary coherences among slits fig 8 shows the real left and imaginary right parts of this mixed state in this case the phase distri bution width is given by 2 11 11 fig 8 a show the reconstructed density matrix by mixing 250 pure states fig 8 b show simulated results using the same 250 states and fig 8 c are the theoretical density matrix the fidelity between experimental and simulated density matrices is f 0 9955 the reported purities are p exp 0 3152 and p sim 0 2870 for experimental and simulated density matrix respectively in this case the lowest purity for a d 11 state is p theo 0 2670 additionally a demonstration of the convergence is shown in the supplementary material 45 v conclusions we have presented a method for the controlled gen eration of mixed spatial qudits with arbitrary degree of purity the state generation is achieved by a succession of random pure qudits according to a pre set probability distribution we have experimentally showed the viabil ity of the method for qudits from dimension d 2 up to d 11 the excellent agreement between experimental simulated and theoretical results demonstrate the feasi bility of the method to easily control the coherence be tween each pair of slits that allow us engineering the state the method can be extended for the generation of composite systems with controllable degrees of entangle ment or mixedness besides it can be used to study the evolution of the system under a specific dynamics since the same technique permit to vary the phases and or the real amplitude of the slits acknowledgments this work was supported by uba cyt
