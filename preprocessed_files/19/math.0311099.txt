group k 2 of a field and universal central extensions quadratic forms central simple algebras differential forms abelian extensions abelian coverings explicit reciprocity laws special values of zeta functions and special values of l functions no proofs minimal bibliography 1 the birth of k 2 11 15 31 it was in 1956 that a grothendieck had the idea of assigning to every scheme x a group k x the letter k stands for klassen and indeed the elements of k x are equivalence classes of certain objects associated to x the need for such a group arose in his generalisation of the riemann roch theorem of f hirzebruch from complex analytic geometry to a relative version in abstract algebraic geometry let us recall the defintion of this group when x spec a is an affine scheme i e the spectrum of a commutative ring a isomorphism classes of finitely generated projective a modules form a commutative monoid m whose law of composition is given by taking the the direct sum there arise in practice a number of morphisms from m into commutative groups grothendieck defined k x also denoted k a in this affine case as the universal object amongst them thus k a is simply the group of differences of the monoid m just as z is the group of difference of the monoid n it is a powerful invariant of the ring a for example when a is the ring of integers in a finite extension of q the torsion subgroup of k a is the group of ideal classes of a when a is a field f the rank or dimension gives an isomorphism k f z h bass realised that a pre grothendieck construction of j h c white head the quotient of gl a limgln a by its derived subgroup should be the right definition of the k 1 of a ring a when a is a field f the determinant gives an isomorphism k 1 f f the next step was taken by j milnor who defined the group k 2 a and a cup product map k 1 a k 1 a k 2 a for every ring a it turned out to be the homology group h 2 d gl a z where d is the derived subgroup a deep theorem of h matsumoto gave a presentation of the k 2 of a field f we have chosen to take this presentation as our starting point to recount a few places where the group k 2 makes its appearance we have had to leave out more than we have been able to include 1 http arxiv org abs math 0311099 v 4 2 definition of k 2 2 20 29 let f be a commutative field and let a be a commutative group an a valued symbol on f is a z bilinear map s f f a satisfying s x y 0 for all x y f f such that x y 1 a symbol s is said to be trivial if s x y 0 for all x y f clearly if s is an a valued symbol on f if f f f is a homomorphism of fields and if a a a is a homomorphism of commutative groups then a s f is an a valued symbol on f example 1 take f r a 1 1 and set s x y 1 if and only if x 0 and y 0 then s is a symbol note that s x y 1 if and only if the conic xr 2 ys 2 1 has a solution r s over r note also that the symbol s is continuous example 2 keep a 1 1 and define an a valued continuous symbol on q 2 bilinearly by s 2 x y 1 x 1 2 y 1 2 s 2 x 2 1 x 2 1 23 x y z 2 one has s 2 x y 1 if and only if the conic has a solution over q 2 example 3 let p be an odd prime number and take f qp a f p denoting by v q p z the valuation one sees that the element 1 v x v y xv y y v x belongs to z p for every x y q p let sp x y be its image in f p then sp is a continuous symbol further hp x y sp x y p 1 2 is also a symbol with values in 1 1 as an exercise show that hp x y 1 if and only if the conic has a solution r s over qp as an aside let us mention the local to global principle for q conics i e curves of genus 0 for x y q the conic has a solution r s over q if and of course only if hp x y 1 for every odd prime p s 2 x y 1 and s x y 1 it so happens that if all but one of these local conditions are satisfied then so is the recalcitrant local condition cf th 10 let f be any field and let x y f the conic has a solution over f if and only if there exists a homomorphism f r s xr 2 ys 2 f of 2 f algebras examples 1 3 thus provide a criterion for the existence of such a homomorphism when f r q 2 qp p odd prime respectively example 4 let k be any field take f k t a k and denote by v f z the valuation for every pair x y f the element belongs to k t let s x y be its image in k then s is a symbol example 5 more generally let f be any field endowed with a discrete valuation v f z and denote the residue field by k we get a k valued symbol s on f by defining s x y to be the image in k of the element s is called the tame symbol associated to v examples 3 and 4 are particular cases examples 1 and 2 are not does there exist a universal symbol u f f uf on f in other words does there exist a commutative group uf and a symbol u on f with values in uf such that given any a valued symbol s on f a being a commutative group there exists a unique homomorphism f uf a of groups such that s f u clearly if such a universal symbol exists it is unique up to unique isomorphism nor is the existence of a universal symbol hard to see just take uf to be the quotient of f z f by the subgroup generated by those elements x y x y f for which x y 1 definition 1 let f be a field the universal symbol on f is denoted f f k 2 f or more precisely by f the risk of confusing the element x y k 2 f with the subset x y f is minor example 6 let k be a field take f k t and a k 2 k write x f as x amt m a 0 bntn b 0 am bn k and define c x am bn which does not depend on the way x is written as a quotient of two polynomials then x y 7 c x c y k is a k 2 k valued symbol on f hence there is a unique homomorphism k 2 f k 2 k such that x y f c x c y k for all x y f one can show that it is a retraction of the canonical homomorphism k 2 k k 2 f in fact milnor defines a graded ring k f n kn f functorially in the field f as being the quotient of the n graded tensor algebra of the z module f t f z f f f by the homogenous ideal generated by the elements x y x y f such that x y 1 thus k 0 f z and k 1 f is generated by x x f subject to the only conditions that xy x y the map x 7 x 3 is an isomorphism f k 1 f we shall say very little about the groups kn f for n 2 if we are given a graded ring a n an and a homomorphism of groups f a 1 such that x y 7 x y is an a 2 valued symbol on f there exists a unique homomorphism of graded rings k f a extending sometimes this homomorphism or its components are also called symbols by abuse of language people go to the extent of calling elements of k f or their images in a symbols quillen has defined higher k groups for arbitrary schemes they do not agree for fields with those of milnor for n 2 in a certain precise sense milnor s theory is the simplest part of quillen s theory proposition 1 let f be a field in the group k 2 f one has i x x 0 x f ii x y y x 0 x y f iii x x 1 x x f proof i this is clear by bilinearity if x 1 if x 6 1 write x 1 x 1 x 1 1 and compute x x x 1 x x 1 x 1 x 1 1 x 1 0 using i we have 0 xy xy x x x y y x y y x y y x so ii holds for iii we have x x 1 x x x 1 x again using i note ii implies that the projection t f k f factors through the exterior algebra f if we tensor all three with z 1 2 3 computations of k 2 17 20 3 the fact that the group k 2 f vanishes for every finite field f will have many consequences when k 2 will be related to other objects like central extensions central simple algebras quadratic forms etc theorem 1 steinberg for every finite field f the group k 2 f is trivial consequently all the higher k groups of a finite field are trivial proof the multiplicative group f of a finite field is always cyclic let be a generator it is sufficient to show that 0 4 one has 2 0 by prop 1 ii this implies that 2 x y 0 for any x y f writing x m y n we have 2 x y 2 m n 2 mn 0 so k 2 f is killed by 2 if f is of characteristic 2 then and 0 by prop 1 i so the proof is complete in this case suppose that 2 is invertible in f a counting argument shows that the equation x 2 y 2 1 has a solution x y f f the number of elements x 2 x f plus the number of elements 1 y 2 y f is cardf so there is a pair x y f such that x 2 y 2 1 necessarily x y f as is not a square we then have 0 x 2 y 2 since as we have seen k 2 f is killed by 2 this completes the proof the symbols of examples 1 2 3 are the only continuous symbols on r q 2 qp p odd respectively moore for more information about the k 2 of local fields see the section on the uniqueness of reciprocity laws let us state the result of tate s computation of k 2 q he was inspired by the first proof of the law of quadratic reciprocity given by the young gauss example 2 provides a homomorphism s 2 k 2 q 1 1 and similarly example 3 provides sp k 2 q f p for every odd prime p given x y q one has sp x y 1 for almost all p so we get a map into the direct sum k 2 q 1 1 z 3 z z 5 z z 7 z theorem 2 tate this map is an isomorphism of groups it is easily seen that the law of quadratic reciprocity is a consequence of tate s calculation we have another symbol on q namely the symbol s of example 1 expressing it in terms of the symbols s 2 s 3 s 5 it turns out to be the product s 2 h 3 h 5 cf examples 2 3 leads to the result when k is a field and f k t the group k 2 f is canonically isomorphic to the direct sum of k 2 k and the various groups k t p where p runs through the maximal ideals of k t cf example 4 thus we get an exact sequence 0 k 2 k k 2 f p k t p 1 which admits a retraction cf example 6 applying this result to the place at infinity of f k one is lead to weil s reciprocity law 5 let a f 2 t be the polynomial ring in one indeterminate over the field f 2 and let a a 0 a 1 a 2 be its gradation consider the homomorphism r a 1 which sends x r to t if and only if x 0 then x y 7 x y x y r is the symbol s of example 1 it can be shown that the associated homomorphism k r 2 k r f 2 t is an isomorphism of graded rings let f be a global field it can be shown bass tate that the real places of f suppose there are r 1 of them induce an isomorphism kn f z 2 z r 1 n 2 4 k 2 and universal central extensions 28 20 recall that the derived subgroup d g of a group g is the subgroup of g generated by all the commutators x y xyx 1 y 1 x y g it is normal in g and g d g is the largest commutative quotient of g a group g is said to be perfect if d g g recall also that an extension of a group g is a pair g p consisting of a group g and a surjective homomorphism p g g it is said to be central if the subgroup ker p g is central a section of an extension is a homomorphism s g g such that p s idg an extension is said to split if it admits a section a morphism from an extension g p to an extension g p of g is a homomorphism of groups f g g such that p p f if an extension g p of g splits it is isomorphic to ker p g pr 2 a central extension u of a group g is said to be universal if given any central extension g of g there exists a unique morphism f u g the universal central extension if it exists is unique up to unique isomorphism with these definitions let us recall a few facts a group g admits a universal central extension if and only if g is perfect a central extension u of a group g is universal if and only if u is perfect and every central extension of u splits the universal central extension g of a perfect group g can be identified with the homology group h 2 g z whose definition we do not recall ker g g is the central subgroup of g under the identification h 2 g h 2 g z endz h 2 g z the extension g corresponds to id h 2 g z h 2 g z also a central extension g p of g is universal if and only if h 1 g z 0 and h 2 g z 0 some people think of g d g h 1 g z as the 0 g of a discrete group g and call it connected if 0 g 1 g is then its universal cover and the kernel of g g is the fundamental group 1 g of g 6 now let f be a field and n 2 an integer the group sln f is perfect with three exceptions when n cardf equals 3 2 3 4 or 4 2 we do not consider them in what follows let g p be its universal central extension for x y f choose x 12 y 13 g such that p x 12 diag x x 1 1 1 and p y 13 diag y 1 y 1 1 in sln f then the commutator x 12 y 13 which depends only on x and y belongs to ker p h 2 sln f z and defines a bilinear map x y 7 x 12 y 13 f f h 2 sln f z theorem 3 matsumoto steinberg apart from the three exceptional n f mentioned above the map is a symbol inducing an isomorphism k 2 f h 2 sln f z note that in view of the triviality of the k 2 of a finite field this theorem implies that the discrete groups sln f n 2 f finite are simply connected leaving aside the three exceptions noted above which are not connected in fact k 2 f is the fundamental group of g f for every simple simply connected split algebraic f group g not just g sln f the only exceptions are spn f for which k 2 f is a quotient of the fundamental group with kernel z 5 k 2 and quadratic forms 19 13 22 let f be a field in which 2 is invertible recall that a regular quadratic space over f is a finite dimensional vector f space v endowed with a regular symmetric bilinear form b it is possible to choose a basis for v and a 1 an f such that one has b a 1 2 1 a 2 2 2 an 2 n for all 1 2 n n dimv in v the isometry classes of quadratic f spaces form a monoid with orthogonal direct sum as the law of addition this monoid is integral witt the corresponding group of differences w f is called the grothendieck group of f the class of the form in w f is denoted a 1 a 2 an a 1 a 2 an tensor product over f makes w f into a ring whose multiplication is characterised by x y xy and for which 1 is the neutral element taking dimensions gives a canonical surjection of rings dim w f z denote by i the kernel the augmentation ideal 7 let h 1 1 1 1 be the class of the hyperbolic plane it corresponds to the quadratic space l homf l f 7 where l is a vector f line the subgroup h generated by h is an ideal in w f a quadratic space a 1 a 2 an represents 0 if and only if a 1 a 2 an b 1 b 2 bn 2 h for some quadratic space b 1 b 2 bn 1 one has h i 0 the quotient w f w f h is called the witt ring of f the image i i h i i of the ideal i is maximal in w f with z 2 z as the quotient we will be mainly interested in the graded f 2 algebra associated to the filtered ring i 3 i 2 i w f there is a homomorphism s 1 f i i 2 given by s 1 x x 1 lemma 1 milnor 1970 the map s 2 x y s 1 x s 1 y is an i 2 i 3 valued symbol on f the corresponding homomorphism from k 2 f is trivial on 2 k 2 f there is therefore a unique homomorphism of graded f 2 algebras s k f 2 k f z 2 z i i 2 i 2 i 3 extending s 1 and s 2 it is easy to see that the discriminant provides an inverse w 1 i i 2 f f 2 of s 1 and the hasse invariant an inverse w 2 i 2 i 3 k 2 f 2 k 2 f of s 2 milnor showed that the map is always surjective and conjectured 1970 that it is bijective for all fields f in which 2 is invertible he proved the bijectivity for global fields the conjecture was finally proved by orlov vishik voevodsky in a preprint available on the arxiv theorem 4 orlov vishik voevodsky 1996 the map is an isomorphism of graded f 2 algebras continuing to assume that 2 is invertible in the field f let f be a separable algebraic closure of f and gal f f the profinite group of f automorphism of f consider the exact sequence 1 1 1 f 2 f 1 of discrete modules the associated long cohomology sequence furnishes upon identifying the module 1 1 2 f with z 2 z an injec tion 1 f f 2 h 1 z 2 z which is an isomorphism by hilbert s theorem 90 h 1 f 0 8 lemma 2 tate 1970 the map 2 x y 1 x 1 y is an h 2 z 2 z valued symbol on f the corresponding homomorphism from k 2 f is trivial on 2 k 2 f there is therefore a unique homomorphism of graded f 2 algebras k f 2 k f z 2 z h 1 z 2 z h 2 z 2 z extending 1 and 2 we have seen that 1 is an isomorphism merkurjev 1981 proved that 2 is an isomorphism milnor 1970 proved that is an isomorphism when f is a finite a local a global or a maximally ordered field his conjecture that this is an isomorphism for all fields f in which 2 is invertible was finally proved by voevodsky in 1996 and got him a medal nearly a decade earlier rost and merkurjev suslin had proved that 3 is an isomorphism theorem 5 voevodsky 1996 the map is an isomorphism of graded f 2 algebras as a consequence of theorems 4 and 5 the graded ring associated to the filtered ring w f is canonically isomorphic to the cohomology ring of the module z 2 z to see how far this result goes note that previous attempts to construct maps between the two let alone showing that they are isomorphisms had been successful only in low degrees 6 k 2 and central simple algebras 20 27 30 let f be a commutative field recall that a finite dimensional asso ciative unital f algebra a is called simple if the only bilateral ideals of a are 0 and a an f algebra a is called central if f is precisely the centre of a every central simple f algebra a is isomorphic to the matrix algebra mn d of a skew field d over f wedderburn the pair n d is uniquely determined by a up to isomorphism two such algebras a a are called similar if the corresponding skew fields are isomorphic similarity classes of central simple f algebras form a group b f the brauer group of f with tensor product as the law of multiplication it is a torsion group as a restriction corestriction argument shows the group b f can also be viewed as the group of f isomorphism classes of f algebras which become isomorphic over a separable algebraic closure f of f to mn f some n with tensor product of algebras providing the group law it can also be viewed as the group of f varieties which are f isomorphic to pn some n 9 now let n 0 be an integer and assume that f contains a primitive nth root of 1 i e f is of order n thus n is invertible in f for a b f consider the f algebra a a b with the presentation xn a yn b xy yx it is a central simple f algebra called a cyclic algebra in general and a quaternion algebra when n 2 since it was so called in the case f r 1 a 1 b 1 by its discoverer hamilton whose class s a b b f is killed by n i e lies in the n torsion nb f before going on observe that a quaternion qp algebra defined by a b q p is the matrix algebra precisely when hp a b 1 example 3 for an odd prime p when s 2 a b 1 example 2 for p 2 and when s a b 1 example 1 for qp r the local to global principle for quaternion q algebras a essentially the same as the one for conics says that a is a matrix algebra if and of course only if a qp is a matrix algebra for every place p of q as before it is in fact sufficient to demand that they be matrix algebras at all places with one possible exception the exception is then not an exception there is a local to global principle for central simple algebras over every global field i e over finite extensions of q or of fp t p prime lemma 3 tate 1970 the map a b 7 s a b is an nb f valued symbol on f theorem 6 merkurjev suslin 1982 the associated map is an isomorphism k 2 f nk 2 f nb f thus every central simple algebra whose class is killed by n is similar to a product of cyclic algebras in the presence of nth roots of 1 the choice of a primitive nth root of 1 in f allows us to identify nb f with h 2 z nz the lemma implies that there is a unique homomorphism of graded z nz algebras k f nk f z nz h 1 z nz h 2 z nz which restricts to the symbol s on f f but let turn to what happens when a primitive nth root of 1 may not be available in f more generally without assuming the existence of a primitive nth root of 1 in f but merely that n is invertible in f we have an exact sequence 1 z nz 1 f n f 1 10 of discrete modules where z nz 1 nf is the group of nth roots of 1 in f with its natural action the associated long exact cohomology sequence and hilbert s theorem 90 furnish as we have seen before in the case n 2 an isomorphism 1 f f n h 1 z nz 1 the next few terms of the same cohomology sequence furnish a canonical isomorphism h 2 z nz 1 nb f a group which also classifies f varieties potentially isomorphic to pn 1 cup product on cohomology h r z nz r hs z nz s hr s z nz r s then provides a bilinear map 2 f f n f f n h 2 z nz 2 lemma 4 tate 1970 the map 2 x y 1 x 1 y is a symbol on f choosing a primitive nth root of 1 when there is one in f and using it to identify the groups nb f h 2 z nz and h 2 z nz 2 the symbol 2 turns out to be the same as the symbol s of lemma 3 the map associated to s is thus the same in this case as the one in the conjecture bloch kato 1986 the associated homomorphism of graded z nz algebras k f nk f z nz h 1 z nz 1 h 2 z nz 2 is an isomorphism for all fields f in which n is invertible the main theorem cf th 6 of merkurjev suslin 1982 says that the map 2 k 2 f nk 2 f h 2 z nz 2 is always an isomorphism tate had proved this earlier 1976 for global fields bloch gabber kato prove this conjecture when f is a field of characteristic 0 endowed with a henselian discrete valuation of residual characteristic p 6 0 and n is a power of p the bloch kato conjecture which remains a major open problem in its full generality makes the remarkable prediction that the graded algebra r h r z nz r is generated by elements of degree 1 galois groups should thus be very special among profinite groups in this respect 7 k 2 and differential forms 10 8 let a be a commutative ring and b a commutative a algebra recall that an a derivation on b is a pair m consisting of a b module m and an a linear map b m such that xy x y x y for all x y b 11 a morphism of a derivations m m on b is an b linear map f m m such that f does there exist a universal a derivation db 1 b a on b clearly it would then be unique up to unique isomorphism as for the existence we just need to take the b module generated by db x x b subject to the relations i db x db x for all a x b ii db x y db x db y for all x b y b iii db xy db x y x db y for all x b y b write 0 b a b and put n b a n b 1 b a for n 0 recall that there is a unique system of a linear maps db n b a n 1 b a extending db b 1 b a verifying db db 0 and such that db db 1 r r db rb a r b a let f be a field in what follows we shall take a z b f and simplify notations to d nf the groups n f are generated by the elements x dy 1 y 1 dyn yn x f y 1 yn f i e the map f f f nf which sends x y 1 yn to is surjective we have a homomorphism dlog 1 f 1 f dlog 1 x dx x of groups lemma 5 tate 1970 the map dlog 2 x y dx x dy y is an 2 f valued symbol on f there is therefore a unique map dlog k f n nf of graded rings which restricts to dlog 2 on k 2 f it restricts to dlog 1 on f now suppose that f is of characteristic p 6 0 and denote by fp the subfield of f which is the image of the homomorphism p f f denote by znf nf the kernel of the differential d nf n 1 f and by b n f znf the image of the differential d n 1 f nf as d p p d for all f nf the differential d is fp linear thus bnf and z n f are vector sub f p spaces we shall consider them as vector f spaces via the isomorphism p f fp recall that there is a unique system of isomorphisms nf znf bnf of vector f spaces such that x dy 1 y 1 dyn yn xp dy 1 y 1 dyn yn bnf 12 for the system of generators of nf cartier we have an fp linear map id nf nf bnf defined by bnf in degree 0 it is the endomorphism x 7 xp x of the additive group f explicitly for the system of generators of the group nf one has x dy 1 y 1 dyn yn xp x dy 1 y 1 dyn yn bnf let n f be kernel of this map it is easy to see that dlogn 0 i e dlogn maps kn f into n f ker as dlogn pkn f 0 we have a map of graded fp algebras dlog k f pk f 0 f 1 f 2 f theorem 7 bloch gabber kato 1986 the map is an isomor phism for every field f of characteristic p 6 0 in degree 0 we get the isomorphism z pz fp ker f f there is also an interpretation of the quotients k f prk f but it is more complicated to state let us briefly mention the case p 2 where the notions of regular bilinear form and regular quadratic space are distinct so we get two objects a filtered ring w f and a w f module q f a theorem of kato 1982 says that the kernel n f of n f nf bnf is isomorphic to in in 1 and the cokernel to inq f in 1 q f 8 k 2 and abelian extensions 23 let f be a field f the maximal abelian extension of f and gal f f the profinite commutative group of f automorphisms of f assume that f is finite we know that then there is a natural map k 0 f z namely n 7 n where is the automorphism x 7 xq q cardf the image of is dense in next let f be a local field i e a finite extension of qp p prime or a field isomorphic to k t where k is a finite field then there is a natural k 1 f f which is less easy to describe whose image is dense in this map and its properties form the essential content of the theory of abelian extensions of local fields what we have just seen are the 0 and 1 dimensional versions of a general theory of n dimensional local fields such a field f n 1 is complete with respect to a discrete valuation whose residue field is an n 1 dimensional local field 13 theorem 8 kato s saito 1986 let f be an n dimensional local field there is a natural homomorphism kn f gal f f whose image is dense in addition this reciprocity map is compatible with norms from finite abelian extensions a notion which we do not pursue here thus for a 2 dimensional local field f the group gal f f is generated as a profinite commutative group by elements of the form x y x y f and all relations among these elements are consequences of bilinearity and x y 1 whenever x y 1 examples of such fields include qp t p prime and k x y where k is a finite field 9 k 2 and abelian coverings of curves 5 25 32 let f be a finite extension of qp or of fp t i e a field complete with respect to a discrete valuation with finite residue field and let c be a smooth proper absolutely connected f curve for x c 1 a closed point of c we have the tame symbol k 2 f c f x at the place x of the function field f c example 5 define v 1 c coker k 2 f c x c 1 f x for every closed point x c 1 there is a norm map f x f inducing a map v 1 c f let v 1 c 0 ker v 1 c f a group introduced by s bloch let 1 c be the profinite group classifying abelian e tale coverings of c it is the maximal commutative quotient of the e tale fundamental group 1 c of c there is a natural surjection 1 c 1 f denote by 1 c 0 the kernel called the the geometric part by general results i e valid for any smooth proper absolutely connected f variety the torsion subgroup of 1 c 0 is finite and the quotient modulo the torsion subgroup is z r where r is the toric rank of the jacobian variety of the albanese variety in general j of c i e the dimension of the maximal split torus in the closed fibre of the ne ron model of j generalising from the classical case of reciprocity maps for 1 dimensional schemes like the spectrum of the ring of integers in a number field one constructs reciprocity maps v 1 c 1 c 0 v 1 c 0 1 c 0 14 we have a commutative diagram with exact rows 0 v 1 c 0 v 1 c f 0 y y y 0 1 c 0 1 c 1 f 0 in which is the reciprocity map for the local field f inducing an isomor phism upon completion of f theorem 9 bloch 1981 s saito 1985 yoshida 2003 the kernel of the reciprocity map 0 is the maximal divisible subgroup of v 1 c 0 and the image is the torsion subgroup of 1 c 0 the kernel of is the maximal divisible subgroup of v 1 c and the quotient of 1 c by the closure of im is z r where r is the toric rank of the jacobian of c the idea is that we have described the group 1 c 0 purely in terms of the group v 1 c 0 constructed from the function field f c just as we describe the group gal h k of k automorphisms of the maximal unramified abelian extension h of a number field k in terms of a group constructed from k namely the ideal class group 10 k 2 and uniqueness of reciprocity laws 21 9 let us briefly recall the definition of the norm residue symbol sometimes called the hilbert symbol let f be a local field other than c and let f f be the group of roots of 1 in f it is cyclic and its order m is invertible in f consider the extension l f m f of f it is the maximal abelian extension of exponent m it is of finite degree as the closed subgroup f m f is of finite index exercise compute this index the quotient f f m admits two descriptions on the one hand by the theory of abelian extensions of local fields it is canonically isomorphic to the group g gal l f of f automorphisms of l on the other hand we get an isomorphism f f m h 1 g f from the short exact sequence 1 f l m l 1 of discrete g modules as the g action on f is trivial we have h 1 g f hom g f thus we get an isomorphism f f m hom f f m f 15 i e a perfect duality of z mz modules the corresponding bilinear map f f f f happens to be a symbol the norm residue symbol it is the universal continuous symbol on f moore further it can be shown that the natural surjective map k 2 f f admits a section and that its kernel is a uniquely divisible group tate merkurjev of course for any divisor d of m we get a continuous d f valued symbol on f by raising the norm residue symbol to the power n d when f r resp q 2 we have m 2 and the symbol s resp s 2 of example 1 resp example 2 is the norm residue symbol when f qp p odd we have m p 1 and the symbol sp of example 3 can be viewed as the norm residue symbol up to the canonical isomorphism f f p example 4 includes the case of local function fields now let f be a global field f f the group of roots of 1 in f and for every real or ultrametric place v of f let fv be the group of roots of 1 in the local field fv put m card f mv card fv m divides mv for every v imaginary places of f play no role in what follows c is connected and therefore the universal continuous symbol on c is trivial consider v fv where v runs over the real or ultrametric places of f we have a natural homomorphism from this direct sum to f which on the v th component is the map 7 mv m also for x y f we have a b fv 1 for almost all v we thus get a sequence k 2 f v fv f 1 the explicit reciprocity law says that this sequence is a complex tate s computation th 2 amounts to saying that is exact for f q and that ker 0 we have seen that in the notation of examples 1 3 hilbert s product formula s s 2 h 3 h 5 1 which is equivalent to the law of quadratic reciprocity is a particular case in general one has uniqueness of reciprocity laws in the following sense theorem 10 moore 1968 the sequence is exact for every global field f when f is a function field of characteristic p tate proved that ker is a finite group of order prime to p for number fields the finiteness of ker was proved by brumer in the totally real abelian case and by garland in general as a consequence of his theorem whose proof uses riemannian geometry and harmonic forms about the vanishing of h 2 sln o r n 6 for the ring of integers o of f now these finiteness results are corollaries of the general results of quillen 16 11 k 2 and special values of functions 2 16 18 24 let f be a global function field over a finite field k let us rewrite the sequence in terms of the multiplicative groups k v of the residue fields kv at the various places v necessarily ultrametric of f at every v there is a canonical isomorphism fv k v there is also an isomorphism f k so the exact sequence becomes 0 ker k 2 f v k v k 1 cf in the case f k t which can also be derived more directly by looking at the tame symbols corresponding to the various discrete valuations of f theorem 11 tate 1970 for a function field f in one variable over a finite field of q elements we have cardker q 2 1 f 1 cardcoker where f is the zeta function of f let us give a brief sketch of the proof let k be an algebraic closure of k and put f fk denote the groups of automorphisms of these z extensions by gal k k gal f f let d be the free commutative group on the places of f i e on the rational points of the k curve corresponding to f or equivalently on the set of discrete valuations of f the maps div f d divisor of a function and deg d z degree of a divisor induce the exact sequences 1 k f d c 0 0 j k c z 0 of modules where j is the jacobian of f tensoring the first one with k yields the exact sequence 0 tor k c k f k d k 1 j k k 0 since j k is a divisible and k a torsion group on the other hand taking tame symbols cf example 5 at the various discrete valuations of f provides an exact sequence of modules 0 ker k 2 f k d k 1 the map e k f k 2 f which sends w f to w f f induces a equivariant map of sequences which can be shown to be an 17 isomorphism it can be shown further that the map induced by the inclusion f f is also an isomorphism thus ker is isomorphic to ker and hence to tor k c which is the kernel of 1 acting on tor k c where is the topological generator t 7 tq the order of this kernel is the same as that of the kernel of 1 q acting on c or what comes to the same 1 q acting on the jacobian j of f where is the frobenius endomorphism to conclude the proof of it suffices to remark that deg 1 q q 2 1 f 1 q 1 what is the analogue of for a number field f the first difficulty is that the zeta function f has a zero of order r 2 the number of imaginary places of f at s 1 but this can be overcome by assuming that f is totally real r 2 0 next one has to interpret the number q 2 1 in this context so let f be a number field let us restrict ourselves to ultrametric places as in and consider only the universal continuous tame symbols at these places again as in at each place v denote by kv the residue field there is a canonical surjection fv k v which is an isomorphism for almost all v the norm residue symbols are tame at almost all places of f from we deduce an exact sequence th 9 k 2 f v k v 1 which will play the role in the totally real case played by in the function field case if we had introduced the k 2 of rings we could have interpreted ker as k 2 o where o is the ring of integers of f what should be the analogue of the number q 2 1 birch and tate with the help of numerical computations of atkin interpreted it as the largest integer m such that gal f f acts trivially on z mz 2 it can also be defined as cardh 0 f q z 2 they were thus led to the conjecture birch tate 1969 for a totally real number field f cardker w 2 f f 1 where w 2 f is the largest m for which gal f f acts trivially on z mz 2 the sign of f 1 is 1 if and only if f has an odd number of real places as follows from the functional equation for f let us note that siegel has proved 1969 that f 1 is a rational number and serre has proved 1971 that w 2 f f 1 is an integer 18 in the special case f q one has q 1 1 12 cardker 2 and w 2 q 24 tate s result that k 2 f h 1 f q z 2 is an isomorphism for a totally real f led lichtenbaum to formulate his more general conjectures about f m for every odd integer m 0 in terms of the gal f f module q z m 1 theorem 12 wiles 1990 the birch tate conjecture is true up to powers of 2 for every totally real number field f and indeed exactly true if moreover f is abelian over q the proof rests on the main conjecture of iwasawa theory for all totally real number fields which has been proved by wiles however for totally real abelian number fields it had been proved earlier by mazur wiles in this abelian case the work of kolyvagin rubin and thaine when combined with the earlier work of iwasawa gives a different and simpler proof of the main conjecture i thank prof john coates and r sujatha for their help in getting these remarks right and for their critical reading of an earlier version of this report up to this point 12 k 2 and special values of l functions 4 6 7 12 let c be a smooth projective absolutely connected curve over q of genus g 1 let n be the conductor and l c s the l function associated to the continuous linear gal q q representation h 1 cq ql for any prime number l l c s converges when the real part of s is 3 2 conjecture hasse weil the function c s n s 2 2 gs s gl c s admits an analytic continuation to the whole of c and satisfies the func tional equation c s w c s 2 with w 1 or w 1 it would follow that c 0 r the conjecture is known to be true for modular curves it is also true for curves of genus 1 as a result of the seminal work of wiles and others showing that all elliptic q curves are quotients of the jacobians of modular curves we are interested in the special value c 0 let f q c be the field of functions of c it is also the field of functions of any regular proper flat z scheme whose generic fibre is c such integral 19 models of c are known to exist fix such a scheme every codimension 1 point p of gives rise to a discrete valuation vp of f and hence example 5 to the tame symbol homomorphism hp k 2 f k p where k p is the residue field at p denote by k 2 c z the intersection of the kernels of all these homomorphisms it is independent of the choice of put k 2 c q k 2 c z z q conjecture beilinson the vector space k 2 c q is g dimensional let x c c be complex analytic curve deduced from c it is a compact connected orientable surface of genus g and comes equipped with a real analytic involution induced by complex conjugation for f g f f recall that f q c consider the real analytic 1 form f g log f darg g log g darg f on the complement in x of the divisors of f and g it is bilinear in f and g this 1 form is closed as d f g is the imaginary part of d log f d log g which vanishes let s be a finite subset of x and a closed smooth 1 form on x s for any oriented smooth loop in x s we have the number x s 1 2 which depends only on the class of in h 1 x s z let f g f be such that f g 1 and take s to be complement in x of the divisors of f g we have f g x s 0 since f g dd f where d is the dilogarithm function a real analytic function of z 6 0 1 in c d z arg 1 z log z im z 0 log 1 t dt t further for s s let s be a smooth loop around s in x and let f g f it can be checked that s f g x s log ts f g where ts is the tame symbol at the place of f determined by s thus if f g happens to lie in k 2 c z then s f g x s 0 for every s s thus we get a pairing h 1 x z k 2 c z r 20 the invariants h 1 x z under complex conjugation lie in the left kernel of it is the restriction to the anti invariants which gives the regulator map h 1 x q k 2 c q r coming from integrating 1 forms against 1 cycles as we have seen note that dimh 1 x q g conjecture beilinson the pairing is perfect choosing q bases for h 1 x q and k 2 c q the pairing gives a matrix in glg r the class of its determinant in r q is independent of the choice of the q bases conjecture beilinson the determinant of equals c 0 in r q a weak version has been proved for elliptic curves having complex multiplications similar conjectures have been advanced for curves over any number field numerical verification has been carried out in some cases i would like to thank ramesh sreekantan and tim dokchitser for a careful reading of this section 13 beyond the multiplicative group and the point 26 1 k 2 is related to numerous other things and it has been generalised to numerous other functors there is the k 2 of a ring there are milnor s higher k groups for fields which we have furtively encountered there are quillen s k groups which make sense for any scheme not just for rings and fields these groups can be sheafified and the cohomology of these sheaves is of interest we have chosen to close by touching upon a recent generalisation due to kato somekawa and akhtar we shall be even more cryptic here than elsewhere in this report as we merely wish to illustrate by one example among many how k 2 continues to play a central ro le in current research the idea is to replace the multiplicative group f of a field f with an algebraic f group g which is an extension 0 t g a 0 of an abelian f variety a by an f torus t i e g is a semi abelian variety over f 21 let g 1 g 2 gs be semi abelian f varieties inspired by the presen tation of k 2 f by generators and relators the group k f g 1 gs is defined by a presentation a typical generator for which is an element of g 1 e gs e for a variable finite extension e of f they are added as elements of this group and are subject to two sets of ralators coming from the projection formula for gi e gi e for a morphism e e of finite extensions and from a certain reciprocity law for gi k vgi ev for the function field k of an f curve with v running over the places of k and ev denoting the residue field at v when each gi 1 i s is the multiplicative group one recovers milnor s ks f for every n 1 invertible in f there is a functorial homomorphism c which makes the diagram g 1 e gs e h 1 e ng 1 h 1 e ngs y y k f g 1 gs z nz c hs f ng 1 ngs commute for every finite extension e of f the map is a particular case it is conjectured that this c is always injective this follows from the bloch kato conjecture in the case when each gi f in this case the result is known as we have seen if s 2 merkurjev suslin or if n 2 a voevodsky take f to be a number field s 2 and g 2 f there is a certain local to global exact sequence for k f g 1 f of which moore s exact sequence is the particular case g 1 f the case when g 1 is the jacobian of a smooth projective f curve having a 0 cycle of degree 1 reduces to a theorem of bloch and kato saito already akhtar has further generalised these k groups to mixed k groups his construction can be seen as a passage from specf to a certain number of smooth quasiprojective f varieties x 1 xr a typical generator of the group k f x 1 xr g 1 gs is an element of a 0 x 1 e a 0 xr e g 1 e gs e involving the chow groups a 0 xi e modulo rational equivalence of 0 cycles on xi e xi f e and the groups of rational points gj e for all 22 finite extensions e of f the relators come essentially as before from the projection formula and the reciprocity law for local symbols the case r 0 gives the k groups of kato somekawa at the other extreme when s 0 and the xi are projective one retrieves the group a 0 x 1 f fxr of 0 cycles modulo rational equivalence the groups k f x g 1 gs where x is a smooth projective f variety and each gi is the multiplicative group f turn out to be the higher chow groups of x as defined by bloch interesting computations have been made over finite fields and local fields but much remains to be done bibliographical references we content ourselves with a very short bibliography
