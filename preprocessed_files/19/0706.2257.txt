define a descent variant of the algebraic k theory of varieties over a field of characteristic zero kd x which coincides with k x for smooth varieties after a result of haesemeyer this new theory is equivalent to the homotopy algebraic k theory introduced by weibel we also prove that there is a natural weight filtration on the groups kh x 1 introduction f guille n and v navarro have proved in gn 02 a general theorem which in presence of resolution of singularities permits to extend some contravariant functors defined on the category of smooth schemes to the category of all schemes in this paper we apply this result to algebraic k theory more specifically we consider the algebraic k theory functor which to a smooth algebraic variety over a field of characteristic zero x associates the spectrum of the cofibration category of perfect complexes k x we apply guille n navarro extension criterion to prove that this functor admits an essentially unique extension to all algebraic varieties kd x which satisfies a descent property is is well known that algebraick theory of schemes does not satisfies descent c haesmeyer has proved in h that the homotopy algebraick theory kh introduced by weibel in w 1 satisfies descent for varieties over a field of characteristic zero from the uniqueness of our extension kd and haesemeyer s result it follows that for any variety x over a field of characteristic zero the spectra kd x and kh x are weakly equivalent following gn 02 we find also an extension of k to a functor with compact support kc which once again by uniqueness is weakly equivalent to the algebraic k theory with compact support introduced by gillet and soule in gs moreover by using the extension theorem in analogy of guille n and navarro s paper gn 03 we are able to prove the existence of some natural filtrations on the kd groups associated to an algebraic variety in fact the kd theory of an algebraic variety x is defined by cubical descent and therefore ifx is a cubical hyperresolution ofx see gnpp there is a convergent spectral sequence see proposition 4 1 3 e pq 1 p 1 kq x kdq p x 1 partially supported by projects dgcyt bfm 2003 06001 and mt m 2006 14575

chosen hyperresolution x of x in the analogous situation for compactly supported algebraic k theory we recover the weight filtration introduced in gs we observe that cortin as haesemeyer and weibel have analyzed in chw the fiber of the morphism k kh in terms of the negative cyclic homology functor acknowledgements we thank f guille n v navarro and a roig for many helpful discussions 2 the descent theorem of guille n navarro in this section we recall the main extension theorem proved by guille n and navarro and present some corollaries of its proof not explicitely stated in gn 02 we also fix some notations 2 1 descent categories the descent theorem in gn 02 is stated for functors from the cate gory of smooth varieties to a cohomological descent category this kind of category is a higher variation of the classical triangulated categories we recall the main features of descent cate gories and refer to gn 02 1 5 3 and 1 7 for the precise definitions see also the proof of proposition 3 2 6 2 1 1 for any finite set s the associated cubical set s is the ordered set of non empty subsets of s and the augmented cubical set s is the ordered set of subsets of s including the empty set when s 0 1 n we simply write n respectively n which may be identified with the ordered set of n 1 tuples i 0 in where ik 0 1 such that there is a k with ik 6 0 and including the 0 0 tuple in the augmented case we will write n 0 ik as usual we will denote by the same symbol the associated category following gn 02 we denote by the category whose objects are finite products of categories s and whose mor phisms are the functors associated to injective maps in each component the objects of will be called cubical index categories is a symmetric monoidal category 2 1 2 let d be a category given a cubical index category a cubical diagram of d is a functor x d we denote by codiag d the category of cubical diagrams of d according to gn 02 we should call these functors cubical codiagrams reserving the term diagram for the contravariant functors x op d its objects are pairs x where x is a cubical diagram a morphism from the diagram x to the diagram y is a functor together with a natural transformation x x y 2 1 3 a descent category is essentially a triple d e s given by a cartesian category d with initial object a saturated class of morphisms e of d called weak equivalences and a functor s codiag d d called the simple functor which satisfy the following properties 1 product for any object x of d there is a natural isomorphism s 0 x 0 x and for any ob and any couple of diagrams x y the morphism s x y s x s y algebraic k theory and cubical descent 3 is an isomorphism 2 factorisation let ob for any diagram x x there is an isomorphism s x s s x natural in x 3 exactness let f x y be a morphisms of diagrams ob if for all the morphism f x y is a weak equivalence i e it is in e then the morphism s f s x s y is a weak equivalence 4 acyclicity criterium let f x 1 x 0 be a morphism of d then f is a weak equivalence if and only if the simple of the 1 diagram x 0 f x 1 is acyclic that is it is weakly equivalent to the final object of d the acyclicity criterium has to be verified also for higher cubical diagrams gn 02 more specifically let x be a n diagram in d and denote by x the cubical diagram obtained from x by restriction to n then the acyclicity criterium takes the following form see property cd 8 op of definition 1 5 3 of gn 02 4 acyclicity criterium the augmentation morphism x 0 s x is a weak equivalence if and only if the canonical morphism s x is a weak equivalence we remark that the transformations and of properties 2 and 4 are in fact part of the data of a descent structure 2 1 4 the categories of complexes give the basic examples of descent categories if a is an abelian category the category of bounded below cochain complexes c a with the class of quasi isomorphisms as weak equivalences and the total functor of a multicomplex as simple functor is a descent category see gn 02 for other examples 2 2 guille n navarro theorem let k be a field of characteristic zero we denote by sch k the category of reduced separated schemes of finite type over k simply called algebraic varieties and by sm k the category of smooth varieties 2 2 1 let y j x g y yf y i x be a cartesian diagram of schemes which we may consider as a 1 diagram we say that it is an acyclic square if i is a closed immersion f is a proper morphism and the induced morphism x y x y is an isomorphism 4 pere pascual and llorenc rubio pons we say that an acyclic square is an elementary acyclic square if all schemes in the diagram are irreducible and smooth and f is the blow up of x along y theorem 2 2 1 gn 02 2 1 5 let d be a cohomological descent category and g sm k hod a contravariant rectified functor satisfying the following conditions f 1 g 0 and the canonical morphism g x y g x g y is an isomorphism f 2 if x is an elementary acyclic square in sm k then sg x is acyclic then there is an extension of g to a rectified functor gd sch k hod which satisfies the descent condition d if x is an acyclic square in sch k sgd x is acyclic moreover this extension is essentially unique if g is another extension of g verifying the descent property d then there is a uniquely determined isomorphism of rectified functors gd g we will say that the functor gd has been obtained from g by cubical descent the proof of guille n navarro s theorem gives more than stated above in fact if x is an algebraic variety and x x is any cubical hyperresolution see gnpp it is proved in gn 02 that under the hypothesis of the theorem gd x sg x gives a well defined functor from sch k to hod independent of the chosen hyperresolution x from this explicit presentation we deduce easely some more properties of the descent extension gd proposition 2 2 2 suppose that the functor g in theorem 2 2 1 is already defined for all varieties that is we have g sch k hod and satisfies f 1 and f 2 then there is a natural transformation of rectified functors g gd proof let x be a variety and x a cubical hyperresolution of x indexed by a cubical set taking the simple of the morphism of cubical diagrams g x g x we get the morphism g x sg x sg x gd x looking at the construction and properties of cubical hyperresolutions it may be proved that the extended functor gd inherits many properties of the functor g over the smooth varieties as an example and in view of their interest in algebraic k theory let us remark the two properties inclosed in the following proposition proposition 2 2 3 consider the hypothesis of theorem 2 2 1 algebraic k theory and cubical descent 5 1 suppose that g is homotopy invariant i e for any smooth variety x the projection x a 1 x induces an isomorphism g x g x a 1 then gd is homotopy invariant for any variety x there is an isomorphism gd x gd x a 1 2 suppose that g satisfies the mayer vietoris i e for any smooth variety x and any open decomposition x u v the square induced by inclusions g x g u y y g v g u v is acyclic in d then gd satisfies mayer vietoris for all varieties proof given x an algebraic variety we fix x a cubical hyperresolution of x 1 by the definition of gd and the homotopy invariance of g we have a sequence of weak equivalences gd x sg x sg x a 1 gd x a 1 so the proof follows 2 by the definition of cubical hyperresolutions see gnpp the restrictions ofx to u v and u v give hyperresolutions of these varieties let s denote by u v and u v respectively these restrictions by construction for any index we have an open decompositionx u v with u v u v so from the mayer vietoris property for g on the category of smooth schemes we deduce that the morphisms g x s g u y g v g u v are weak equivalences for any by the exactness property of descent categories we have that sg x s s g u y g v g u v is also a weak equivalence but by the factorization axiom of descent categories the simple on the right is weak equivalent to s sg u y sg v sg u v so taking into account the definition of gd we finally deduce that the morphism gd x s gd u gd u v gd v is a weak equivalence hence tha mayer vietoris property for open sets follows 6 pere pascual and llorenc rubio pons 2 3 extension with compact support in gn 02 the authors present some variations on the main theorem in particular they prove in gn 02 2 2 2 that with the same hypothesis of theorem 2 2 1 there is an extension gc of g with compact support if schc k denotes the category of varieties and proper morphisms there is an extension of g to a rectified functor gc schc k hod which satisfies the descent property d and moreover dc if y is a subvariety of x then there is a natural isomorphism gc x y s 0 gc x gc y 3 the descent category of spectra in this section we prove that the category of spectra with the homotopy limit as a simple functor is a cohomological descent category in the sense of gn 02 3 1 fibrant spectra we will work in the category of fibrant spectra of simplicial sets our main references will be the paper by bousfield friedlander bf and section 5 of thomason s t 80 recall that a prespectrum is a sequence of pointed simplicial sets xn n 0 together with structure maps xn xn 1 where for a pointed simplicial set k k s 1 k a prespectrum x is a fibrant spectrum also called spectrum if each xn is a fibrant simplicial set and the maps xn xn 1 obtained by adjunction of the structure maps are weak equivalences morphisms between preespectra and between fibrant spectra are defined as maps in each degree that commute with the structure maps we denote by presp and sp the categories of prespectra and fibrant spectra respectively the homotopy groups of a prespectrum x are defined by the direct limit k x lim k n xn k z so that if x is a fibrant spectrum k x k n xn for k n 0 and more specifically for k 0 k x k x 0 a map f x y of prespectra is a weak equivalence if it induces an isomorphism on homotopy groups in this way a map of fibrant spectra is a weak equivalence if and only if it induces weak equivalences in each degree 3 2 homotopy limit let x be a functor from an index category i to sp the homotopy limit spaces holimxn n 0 in the sense of bousfield kan bk chapter xi define a fibrant spectrum holimx see t 80 5 6 in fact one can see that presp has a structure of simplicial closed model category see s so that we can apply the general theory of homotopy limits for theses categories h the main properties we need of homotopy limits between fibrant spectra are i functoriality and exactness on fibrant spectra let f x y be a morphism of i diagrams spectra then there is a natural morphism holimf holimx holimy algebraic k theory and cubical descent 7 if for each i the morphism f x y is a weak equivalence then holimf is a weak equivalence ii functoriality on the index category and cofinality theorem given a functor i j and a diagram x j sp there is a natural map holimjx holimi x where x x if is left cofinal this morphism is a weak equivalence iii for any diagram x i sp there is a natural map limx holimx 3 2 1 for a cubical diagram of spectra x sp we define the simple spectrum of x as the homotopy limit s x holim x for a fixed cubical category s defines a functor s codiag sp sp and by the functoriality of the homotopy limit with respect to the index category we obtain a functor s codiag sp sp 3 2 2 following gn 02 1 4 3 we extend the functor s to augmented cubical diagrams by using the cone construction for instance if f x y is a 0 diagram of spectra that is to say a morphism it follows from loc cit that s 0 f s 1 x f y which is weakly equivalent to the homotopy fiber of f take an isomorphism n 0 n 1 as the cone construction respects this product struc ture we find s n x s n 1 s 0 x that is by viewing x as a morphism of two n 1 diagrams f x 0 x 1 the simple spectrum associated to x is obtained as the simple of the n 1 cubical diagram which in each degree has the homotopy fiber of f as a consequence the simple spectrum s nx is isomorphic to the total fiber space of x as defined by goodwillie in g 3 2 3 if x is a n diagram and x denotes its restriction to n it follows from the general properties of homotopy limits outlined above that there is a natural map x 0 holimx as a consequence of g 1 1 b compare also with p proposition 3 3 for a similar situation we obtain proposition 3 2 1 let x n sp be an augmented cubical diagram of spectra and x the cubical diagram obtained by restriction to n the simple s n x is isomorphic to the homotopy fiber of the morphism x 0 s x holimx denote by the initial object of sp the following corollary relates the simple of a cubical diagram with the simple of an augmented diagram corollary 3 2 2 let x n sp be a cubical diagram of spectra and let x the augmented cubical diagram obtained from x by adding x 0 then s n x s nx 8 pere pascual and llorenc rubio pons we also deduce the following result which will be used later corollary 3 2 3 let x be a n diagram of spectra then there is a convergent spectral sequence e pq 1 p 1 q x q p s nx proof consider the cubical diagrams f px defined by f px x if p 1 if p 1 observe that f 1 x is the constant diagram defined by and that f nx x we obtain a sequence of cubical diagrams f nx f n 1 x f 0 x which is a degreewise sequence of fibrations of spectra hence taking homotopy limits there is a sequence of fibrations s f nx s f n 1 x s f 0 x the bousfield kan spectral sequence associated to the tower of fibrations obtained by adjoining identities from the left converges to the homotopy of s f nx s x the e 1 terms are e pq 1 q p sgr px where gr px is the diagram obtained degree wise as the fibers of the morphism s f px s f p 1 x but reasoning as in the proof of proposition 3 3 of p for these diagrams we have s ngr px p 1 px hence it follows that e pq 1 q p p 1 px p 1 q x convergence is a consequence of lemma 5 48 of t 80 3 2 4 we say that an augmented cubical diagram of spectra x is acyclic if the canonical morphism s x is a weak equivalence the acyclic diagrams are also called homotopy cartesian diagrams see g and w 1 from proposition 3 2 1 it follows immediately see also w 1 proposition 1 1 corollary 3 2 4 let x n sp be an augmented cubical diagram of spectra and x the cubical diagram obtained by restriction to n then x is acyclic if and only if the natural morphism x 0 holimx is a weak equivalence remark 3 2 5 observe that for n 2 this result reduces to the well known fact that a square of fibrant spectra x y y yh x k y algebraic k theory and cubical descent 9 is acyclic or homotopy cartesian if and only if the natural map from x to the homotopy limit of x k y h y is a weak equivalence 3 2 5 after the remarks above on sp we have a class of weak equivalences and a simple functor s codiag sp sp according to gn 02 de finition 1 7 1 to have a cohomological descent category on sp we also need the following data i a natural transformation s s s ii a natural transformation idsp s i in such a way that s 0 coreal sp defines a comonoidal quasi strict functor see loc cit as the homotopy limit is the end of a functor by fubini theorem see m there is a natural transformation s s s such that for any diagram x x is an isomorphism as for recall that s x is the function space from the classifying space of the index category to x so one defines x x s x by constant functions proposition 3 2 6 the category of fibrant spectra sp with weak homotopy equivalences as weak equivalences and the homotopy limit holim as simple functor for cubic diagrams and the natural transformations defined above is a cohomological descent category proof the actual definition of cohomological descent category consist of 8 axioms which are dual to the axioms cd 1 cd 8 of gn 02 definition 1 5 3 see also their 1 7 much of them are immediate from the definitions and the properties of homotopy limits so we comment the four axioms summarized in section 2 1 3 see also r for an extension of this result to stable simplicial model categories it is clear from the definitions that sp is a cartesian category with initial object 1 product since the homotopy limit is an end it is compatible with products so for any diagrams x y of sp there is a natural isomorphism s x y s x s y 2 factorisation also because of the fubini theorem for ends if x is a diagram there are natural isomorphism s s x s x s s x see t 80 lemma 5 7 3 exactness if f x y is a morphism of diagrams in sp such that for any the morphism f is a weak equivalence then s f s x s y is a weak equivalence since the homotpy limit preserves weak equivalences between fibrant spectra see t 80 5 5 observe that this property is not true for prespectra 4 acyclicity criterium this is exactly the result of corollary 3 2 4 10 pere pascual and llorenc rubio pons 4 descent algebraic k theory 4 1 let x be a noetherian separated scheme we denote by k x the k spectrum associated to the category of perfect complexes on x see tt definition 3 1 it defines a contravari ant functor from the category of noetherian separated schemes to the category of spectra sp tt 3 14 moreover it is a covariant functor for perfect projective maps and for proper flat morphisms tt 3 16 theorem 4 1 1 let k be a field of characteristic zero the functor k sm k hosp admits a unique extension up to unique isomorphism of rectified functors to a functor kd sch k hosp such that satisfies the descent property d d if x is an acyclic square in sch k skd x is acyclic proof by proposition 3 2 6 we know that sp is a descent category so in order to apply guille n navarro descent theorem 2 2 1 we have to verify properties f 1 f 2 the first one is immediate while f 2 follows from thomason s calculation in t 93 of the algebraic k theory of a blow up along a regularly immersed subscheme as has been observed by many authors see for example in h gs and chsw in the context of cubical spectra we propose the following presentation of property f 2 con sider an elementary acyclic square as in 2 2 1 and the square of spectra obtained by application of the algebraic k functor k x i k y f y yg k x j k y we have to prove that this square is an acyclic square of spectra if n is the conormal bundle of y in x then y p n so the morphism d k y k y induced by the functor which is defined on a sequence of perfect complexes by e 0 ed 1 7 d 1 i 0 op n i lg ei is a weak equivalence see tt theorem 4 1 and also t 91 for the blown up variety x it has been proved by thomason see t 93 the ore me 2 1 that the morphism k x d 1 k y k x algebraic k theory and cubical descent 11 which is induced by the functor on perfect complexes given by f e 1 ed 1 7 f f d 1 i 1 j op n i lg ei is also a weak equivalence define j k x d 1 k y d k y componentwise by g i on the first component and the morphism given by multiplication by 1 n in the y components after the self intersection formula t 93 3 1 4 the diagram k x d 1 k y k x j y yj d k y k y is commutative since are weak equivalences it is an acyclic diagram consider now the augmented commutative cubical diagram k x w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w k x d 1 k y wwnn n n n n n n n n n n n j k x i f k x j k y w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w d k y wwnn n n n n n n n n n n n k y g k y where the horizontal back arrows are the inclusion on the first factor as the right and left side squares are acyclic it follows from the definition in 3 2 2 that it is an acyclic cubical diagram but the back square is acyclic because the two horizontal morphisms have the same cofiber so the front square must be acyclic which is what has to be proved for a k variety x we will denote by kd x the homotopy groups of kd x kd x kd x the descent property d gives rise to exact sequences corollary 4 1 2 let x an acyclic square in sch k then there is an exact sequence kdn x f i kdn x kdn y j g kdn y kdn 1 x more generally if x is a k variety then kd x is defined as the simple of the cubical diagram of spectra k x where x is a cubical hyperresolution so from proposition 3 2 3 we deduce 12 pere pascual and llorenc rubio pons proposition 4 1 3 let k be a field of characteristic zero and x be an algebraic k variety let x be a cubical hyperresolution of x then there is a convergent spectral sequence e pq 1 p 1 kq x kdq p x if x is of dimension d we can take cubical hyperresolutions of size d see gnpp i 2 15 so it follows corollary 4 1 4 let k be a field of characteristic zero and x be an algebraic k variety of dimension d then kdn x 0 n d 4 2 some properties of kd as explained in section 1 kd inherites many properties of the algebraic k theory of smooth schemes for example from proposition 2 2 3 and the properties of homotopy invariance and mayer vietoris for the k theory of smooth schemes see q we deduce immediately proposition 4 2 1 the descent kd theory satisfies 1 kd is homotopy invariant that is for any variety x the projection x a 1 x induces a weak equivalence kd x kd x a 1 2 kd has the mayer vietoris property that is if x u v with u v open sets then the square kd x kd u y y kd v kd u v is homotopy cartesian one may prove in a similar maner that kd satisfies the fundamental bass theorem also following t 80 w 1 one can prove the existence of a brown gersten type spectral sequence e pq 2 h p x k d q kd p q x where k d stands for the sheaf in the zariski topology associated to the presheaf kd 4 3 equivalence with homotopy algebraic k theory in h theorem 3 5 haesemeyer has proved that the homotopy algebraic k theory kh of an algebraic variety x defined by weibel in w 1 see also tt satisfies the descent axiom d as the kh theory coincides with k theory for smooth varieties we can apply the uniqueness property of the extension theorem 2 2 1 to obtain corollary 4 3 1 let x be an algebraic variety over a field of characteristic zero there is a natural morphism kd x kh x in hosp which is a weak equivalence this may also be stated as a uniqueness result for kh theory algebraic k theory and cubical descent 13 corollary 4 3 2 let k be a field of characteristic zero the homotopy algebraic k theory kh is the unique rectifiable functor sch k hosp up to equivalence which satisfies the descent property d and is equivalent to the algebraic k functor k over smooth algebraic varieties 4 4 algebraic k theory with compact support we can apply the same arguments of the proof of theorem 4 1 1 jointly with the compact support extension theorem in gn 02 to extend the algebraic k theory of smooth projective varieties over a field of characteristic zero to a theory with compact support theorem 4 4 1 let k be a field of characteristic zero and v k be the category of smooth projective k varieties the rectified contravariant functor k v k hosp admits a unique extension up to unique isomorphism of rectified functors to a functor kc schc k hosp such that satisfies the descent property d and the compact support descent property dc if y is a subvariety of x then there is a natural isomorphism kc x y holim k c x kc y in other words property dc says that the sequence kc x y kc x kc y is a fibration sequence in hosp so that taking homotopy groups it gives rise to a long exact sequence kcn x y k c n x k c n y k c n 1 x y in gs theorem 7 gillet soule defined a k theory with compact support satisfying dc so by the uniqueness of the compact support extension we find corollary 4 4 2 let x be an algebraic variety over a field of characteristic zero then kc x is naturally isomorphic in hosp to the algebraic k theory with compact support introduced by gillet and soule in gs theorem 7 we will write kc x k c x 5 weight filtration in this section we prove that there are well defined filtrations on the groups kd x or equivalently on kh x and on the groups k c x which are trivial for x smooth in the compact support case we recover the weight filtration obtained by gillet soule gs we fix a field k of characteristic zero 14 pere pascual and llorenc rubio pons 5 1 let x be an algebraic variety the spectral sequence 4 1 3 associated to a cubical hy perresolution x of x induces a filtration on the groups kdn x our next goal is to prove that this filtration on kdn x is independent of the cubical hyperresolution x we will follow section 3 of gn 03 closely where the authors analyze the weight filtration in an abelian setting 5 2 towers of fibrant spectra first we introduce a cohomological descent structure on the category of towers of fibrations tow sp 5 2 1 a tower of fibrations x is a sequence of fibrations of spectra x n x n 1 x 1 x 0 a morphism of towers of fibrations is a morphism of diagrams we denote by tow sp the category of towers of fibrations defining weak equivalences of towers of fibrations and simple functors for cubical diagrams degree wise it is immediate to prove the following result proposition 5 2 1 the category of towers of fibrations tow sp together with weak equiva lences and simple functors for cubical diagrams defined degree wise is a descent category 5 2 2 we now introduce a second descent structure on tow sp recall that if x is a tower of fibrations there is a functorial spectral sequence e pq 1 q p f p q p x where f p is the fiber of the morphism x p x p 1 and x limx p see t 80 5 43 where convergence is understood in the sense of bousfield kan definition 5 2 2 we say that a morphism of towers f x y is an e 2 weak equivalence if the morphism e 2 f induced on the e 2 terms of the corresponding spectral sequences is an isomorphism observe that if fp x p y p is a weak equivalence for all p 0 then f induces an isomorphism in the e 1 terms of the spectral sequence and hence it is also a e 2 weak equivalence 5 2 3 now we define a simple construction s 2 tow sp tow sp compatible with the e 2 weak equivalences given a tower of fibrations x and a positive integer n 0 we denote by x n the tower of fibrations defined by x n p 0 p n x p n p n with the evident morphisms so that the new tower is obtained by translating n places to the left the tower x definition 5 2 3 let be a cubical category and x be a diagram of towers of fibra tions denote by dx the diagram of towers of fibrations given by dx x 1 algebraic k theory and cubical descent 15 with morphisms induced by x we define the s 2 simple of x as the tower of fibrations obtained by applying homotopy limits in each cubical degree of dx that is s 2 x p s dx p holim x p 1 for example given a 1 diagram x of towers of fibrations x 1 x 0 y y y 1 y 0 x x z 1 z 0 the new diagram dx is the diagram x 1 x 0 y y y 0 x x z 1 z 0 and it follows that its s 2 simple in degree p corresponds to the spectrum holim x p y p 1 z p lemma 5 2 4 for any cubical diagram of towers of fibrations x there is a canonical isomorphism of complexes of abelian groups e q 1 s 2 x s 7 e q 1 x proof the notation s 7 e q 1 x refers to the ordinary simple functor for complexes of abelian groups also called the total complex associated to a cubical complex the group in degree p of this complex is s 7 e q 1 x p s 7 q rf r r p 1 q r f r while the differential is induced by the differentials of the bousfield kan spectral sequence of the tower x on the other hand by definition for each p s 2 x p is the ordinary simple of the cubical diagram of spectra dx p so the complex e q 1 s 2 x is the e 1 term of the bousfield kan spectral sequence associated to the tower of fibrations sdx p sdx 1 sdx 0 16 pere pascual and llorenc rubio pons denote by f p the fiber of the fibration x p x p 1 since homotopy limits com mute the fiber of the fibration sdx p sdx p 1 is isomorphic to the simple spectrum associated to the cubical diagram df p but in this diagram all morphisms are constant so sdf p 1 f p 1 r p 1 p rf r hence its homotopy groups are given by e pq 1 q p sdf p r p 1 q r f r the differential is also induced by the differentials of the bousfield kan spectral sequence of the tower x proposition 5 2 5 the simple s 2 and the e 2 weak equivalences define a cohomological descent category structure on tow sp proof observe that a morphism between towers of fibrations f is a e 2 weak equivalence if and only if the morphism e 1 f of the corresponding spectral sequence is a quasi isomorphism of complexes if grc z denotes the category of graded complexes of abelian groups the functor e 1 tow sp grc z x 7 e 1 commutes with direct sums and by the previous result it commutes with the simple s 2 functor so the result follows from gn 02 1 5 12 5 3 an extension criterion for towers in the next result we write ho 2 tow sp for the homotopy category obtained from tow sp by inverting e 2 weak equivalences the following result remarked by navarro several years ago in the abelian context is the key point in order to extend some functors on sm k with values in the category of spectra to functors defined for all varieties and taking values in ho 2 tow sp proposition 5 3 1 compare with gn 03 proposition 3 10 let g sm k hosp be a rectifiable functor and denote also by g sm k ho 2 tow sp the associated constant functor then g satisfies property f 2 if and only if for every ele mentary acyclic square the sequence 0 ng x f i ng x ng y j g ng y 0 is exact proof the f 2 property for the extended functor g says that the morphism e q 1 g x e q 1 s 2 g x algebraic k theory and cubical descent 17 is a quasi isomorphism observe that we have e q 1 g x q g x p 0 0 p 6 0 by the other hand the e 1 page of the spectral sequence of s 2 g x reduces to the exact sequence ng x ng y j g ng y so the f 2 property is equivalent to the the fact that the morphism of complexes of abelian groups ng x f i ng x ng y j g ng y is a quasi isomorphism which is precisely the condition stated in the proposition 5 3 1 we return now to the applications to algebraic k theory the following proposition has also been proved by gillet soule directly from thomason s calculations see gs theorem 5 proposition 5 3 2 for any elementary acyclic square of sm k and any n 0 the sequence 0 kn x f i kn x kn y j g kn y 0 is exact proof as we have recalled in the proof of theorem 4 1 1 an elementary acyclic square gives rise to a homotopy cartesian square of algebraic k theory spectra so we have an exact sequence kn x f i kn x kn y j g kn y kn 1 x but by thomason calculation of the algebraic k theory of a blow up t 93 there are iso morphisms kn x d 1 i 1 kn y kn x d 1 i 0 kn y kn y given respectively by x y 1 yd 1 f x d 1 i 1 j i g yi y 0 y 1 yd 1 d 1 i 0 j i g yi with this identifications the morphism f corresponds to the inclusion of kn x on the first factor of kn x and so the morphism f i is injective this splits the exact sequence above into the required short exact sequences 18 pere pascual and llorenc rubio pons now by propositions 5 3 1 and 5 3 2 we can apply the extension criterion of theorem 2 2 1 so we find corollary 5 3 3 let k be a field of characteristic zero the constant algebraic k theory functor k sm k ho 2 tow sp admits an essentially unique extension kd sch k ho 2 tow sp which satisfies the descent property d moreover for any variety x the tower of fibrations kd x satisfies kd n x kd x for n 0 proof we have only to justify the last sentence take an algebraic variety x and an hyperres olution x whose type is of length by the definition of the descent functor kd the tower kd x is the s 2 simple tower associated to the diagram of constant towers k x that is it is the tower whose spectra are the homotopy limits of the diagram dk x n for each n see definition 5 2 3 observe that this diagram is constant for n and moreover it is precisely the cubical diagram x so the result follows since the spectral sequence of a tower of fibrations is functorial in the category ho 2 tow sp from the e 2 term on we deduce from the corollary above corollary 5 3 4 there is a well defined and functorial finite increasing filtration f p on kdn x which is trivial for smooth varieties remark 5 3 5 equivalently by 4 3 1 for any variety x the last corollary defines a functorial finite filtration on the homotopy algebraic k theory groups khn x 5 4 finally we observe that the same procedure may be applied to the algebraic k theory with compact support in this case from the uniqueness property of descent extensions and gs theorem 7 we deduce corollary 5 4 1 there is a well defined and functorial finite increasing filtration w pkcn x which is trivial for complete smooth varieties this filtration coincides with the
