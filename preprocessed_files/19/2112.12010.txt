ometry broadly construed over p adically complete commutative rings these developments include foundational advances within the subject as well as external applications contents introduction 1 1

introduction fix a prime number p the last decade has witnessed multiple conceptual advances in algebraic geometry over mixed characteristic rings which in this article we take to mean commutative rings that are p adically complete these advances have led to the resolution of longstanding questions in different areas of mathematics where p adic completions appear moreover entirely new and fascinating domains of inquiry have been uncovered the goal of this survey is to discuss some of these developments especially in topics close to the author s expertise a highlight of the last decade of activity in the area has been its seat as an exchange of ideas across different fields of mathematics for instance a central topic of this survey is prismatic cohomology which is a new cohomology theory for mixed characteristic rings 1 and 2 its discovery was inspired in part by calculations in homotopy theory and in part by developments in galois representation theory remark 3 5 prismatic cohomology in turn played a prominent role in the proof of a mixed characteristic analog of the kodaira vanishing theorem theorem 4 7 which then helped develop the minimal model program in the birational geometry of arithmetic threefolds theorem 4 10 in the reverse direction an important flatness lemma discovered in the solution 3 of a longstanding question in commutative algebra facilitated via prismatic cohomology again the proof of an analog of bott s vanishing theorem for algebraic k theory theorem 3 8 the author hopes this survey can convey some of the excitement surrounding this interplay of ideas we emphasize right away that the topics covered are chosen somewhat idiosyncratically and we have not attempted to be comprehensive even in the topics we do cover to make partial amends a number of references have been included to help the reader navigate the subject moreover the level of the exposition is uneven across sections for instance we have taken a macroscopic view of topics that are reasonably well documented elsewhere but have gone into more detail and depth while covering very recent ideas that seem promising 1 http arxiv org abs 2112 12010 v 1 2 bhargav bhatt this survey is organized as follows in 1 we discuss relative prismatic cohomology and related developments the absolute version of this story which is comparatively new is the subject of 2 we then present applications covering algebraic k theory in 3 and commutative algebra and birational geometry in 4 we end in 5 with some relatively recent work on p adic riemann hilbert problems and their algebro geometric implications all rings that appear are assumed commutative unless otherwise specified 1 prisms and relative prismatic cohomology in the last century especially following the work of grothendieck cohomology theories have emerged as extremely important tools in algebraic geometry and number theory they lie at the heart of some of the deepest theorems and conjectures in both subjects for example classical hodge theory which studies the singular cohomology with real complex coefficients for complex varieties is a central topic in modern algebraic geometry with applications throughout the subject and beyond likewise p adic hodge theory which studies the p adic cohomology of p adic varieties is an equally fundamental notion in arithmetic geometry it provides one of the best known tools for understanding galois representations of the absolute galois group of q moreover unlike in the complex setting there is a large number of cohomology theories in the p adic world tale de rham hodge crystalline de rham witt etc in this section we will report on work from the last few years dedicated to finding an organizational framework to better understand p adic cohomology theories in p adic arithmetic geometry especially their relationships with each other remark 1 1 why do derived objects appear repeatedly before embarking on our journey let us explain one reason derived notions i e those with a homological homotopical flavor often appear in recent work in the area and consequently also in our exposition in classical algebraic geometry the fundamental objects are smooth algebraic varieties over an algebraically closed field similarly in mixed characteristic algebraic geometry the basic geomet ric objects are p adic formal 1 smooth schemes over the ring of integers oc of a complete alge braically closed nonarchimedean field c qp in particular unlike the classical setting the rings of functions that appear in mixed characteristic algebraic geometry are often not noetherian in deed the ring oc is a non noetherian valuation ring as its value group is divisible replacing oc with a discrete valuation ring like zp while quite tempting and important for applications leads to arithmetic subtleties that one would like to avoid at least at first pass in a purely geometric study even more exotic non noetherian rings are critical to several recent innovations in the area such as perfectoid geometry 202 143 descent techniques for extremely fine grothendieck topologies such as the pro tale quasi syntomic v and arc topologies 40 205 41 37 39 the theory of rings 138 etc in the non classical situations described above derived notions often have better stability properties than their classical counterparts for instance given a commutative ring r with a finitely generated ideal i the category of derived i complete r modules forms an abelian subcategory e g it is closed under kernels and cokernels of the category of all r modules unlike the subcategory of classically i adically complete r modules moreover the assignment carrying r to the category di comp r of derived i complete r complexes forms a stack for the flat topology or even a suitably defined i completely flat topology unlike the corresponding assignment at the triangulated category level for such reasons the language of higher category theory and derived algebraic geometry 169 170 171 223 224 has played an important role in the developments discussed in this paper 1 a p adic formal scheme is a formal scheme whose affine opens are given by formal spectra of p adically complete rings equipped with the p adic topology algebraic geometry in mixed characteristic 3 the work described in this section began with the goal to enhance fontaine s perspective 93 on p adic hodge theory to work well with integral coefficients a concrete goal was to understand how the torsion in the zp tale cohomology of the geometric generic fibre of a smooth projective scheme over a mixed characteristic discrete valuation ring relates to the torsion in the crystalline cohomology of its special fibre this question was already stressed by grothendieck in his algerian letter to deligne in 1965 see 60 for a survey on the status of this question 20 years ago and 2 in loc cit for history after initial attempts 38 39 that worked well in important examples a satisfactory theory was found via the notion of a prism recalled next the definition relies on the notion of a ring which is roughly a commutative ring a equipped with a map a a lifting the frobenius endomorphism f 7 fp of a p interpreted in a derived sense when a has p torsion see 138 61 the importance of this notion in arithmetic geometry has long been stressed by borger see 57 definition 1 2 prisms 42 a prism is a pair a i where a is a ring and i a is an invertible ideal such that a is derived p i complete and p i i write a a i in practice we restrict to bounded prisms i e those prisms a i where the p power torsion in a is annihilated by pn for some n 0 this restriction allows us to avoid certain derived technicalities without sacrificing the key examples two important examples are discussed next see remark 1 9 for another key example example 1 3 crystalline prisms if a is any p complete p torsionfree ring then a p is a bounded prism for instance given a reduced fp algebra r we could take a w r to be the ring of p typical witt vectors of ring with its natural frobenius lift example 1 4 perfect prisms a prism a i is called perfect if the frobenius a a is an isomorphism any such prism is bounded and the ring a is perfectoid as in 101 38 in fact the construction a i 7 a yields an equivalence of categories between perfect prisms and perfectoid rings thus the notion of a prism may be viewed as a deperfection of the notion of a perfectoid ring an important example is the perfect prism a i corresponding to the perfectoid ring a oc where c qp is a complete and algebraically closed extension we call this a fontaine prism in homage to its discovery 92 5 given a bounded prism a i as well as an a scheme x the following key definition allows us to extract an a linear cohomology theory for x definition 1 5 the relative prismatic site fix a bounded prism a i and a p adic formal a scheme x the relative prismatic site x a is the category of all bounded prisms b j over a i equipped with an a map spf b j x topologized via the flat topology write o i and o for the sheaves obtained by remembering b j or b j respectively so there is a natural action on o and o o i write r x a r x a o for the resulting cohomology theory the main comparison theorems for r x a are informally summarized next theorem 1 6 relative prismatic cohomology 38 42 fix a bounded prism a i and let x be a smooth p adic formal a scheme the relative prismatic cohomology theory r x a recovers the standard integral p adic cohomology theories for x a with their extra structures e g tale de rham hodge crystalline de rham witt via a specialization procedure thereby giving new relationships between them for instance if a i is crystalline theorem 1 6 leads to a canonical frobenius descent of crystalline cohomology 17 this descent was previously observed on cohomology groups in 189 4 bhargav bhatt 210 on the other hand the ainf cohomology of 38 is recovered by specializing to a fontaine prism we refer to the surveys 183 24 for more precise assertions with pictures about the comparisons in this case an early concrete application of the latter was the following result relating tale and de rham cohomology integrally via classical comparisons this gives a new technique to bound the p torsion in singular cohomology of complex algebraic varieties via the geometry of their mod p reductions corollary 1 7 torsion inequality 38 let c qp be a complete and algebraically closed field with residue field k e g we may take c cp q p so k fp let x oc be a proper smooth p adic formal scheme then dimfp h i et xc fp dimk h i dr xk for all i 0 more generally a similar inequality bounds the length of the torsion subgroup of h iet xc zp in terms of that of h i crys xk in particular if the latter is torsionfree so is the former since its discovery the prismatic theory in 38 42 has found several applications some of which are discussed below and elsewhere in this paper other results featuring this theory include hodge theory of classifying spaces of reductive groups 154 28 vanishing theorems for the cohomology of the moduli space of curves with level structures 196 essential dimension calculations 89 poincar duality for z pn coefficients in rigid geometry 232 calculation of the zp cohomology of drinfeld s p adic symmetric spaces 67 a fairly optimal form of dieudonn theory in mixed characteristic 8 better understanding of the moduli stacks of breuil kisin fargues modules 81 and several improvements to known comparisons in integral p adic hodge theory 182 160 161 remark 1 8 rational comparison theorems specializing part of theorem 1 6 to a fontaine prism a i gives a generalization of fontaine s crystalline comparison conjecture ccrys to proper smooth formal schemes x a variants of both this result and its proof have a long history in p adic hodge theory including 95 50 83 85 226 187 15 68 remark 1 9 q de rham cohomology 42 given a smooth z algebra r equipped with a choice of tale co ordinates which we call a framing and indicate by one can define a complex q r of zjq 1 k modules by q deforming the differential of the de rham complex r z see 12 204 this complex strongly depends on the framing nevertheless motivated by some local calculations from 38 scholze had conjectured in 204 that q r is independent of the framing up to canonical quasi isomorphism this conjecture was deduced from the existence of prismatic cohomology in 42 as explained next prior partial progress was made by pridham 192 also using rings by a patching procedure scholze s co ordinate independence conjecture reduces to its analog when all objects are p completed the latter follows from the existence of prismatic cohomology relative to the q de rham prism a i zpjq 1 k qp 1 q 1 where q qp given a formally smooth p complete zp algebra r equipped with a framing as before the relative prismatic complex r spf r zp a a which is visibly independent of the framing is naturally quasi isomorphic to the q dr complex q r the preceding perspective on q de rham cohomology also yields a formalism for more sys tematically discussing related notions such as e g gauss manin q connections we refer to 64 107 108 184 for more on these and related developments remark 1 10 perfections in mixed characteristic 42 the theory of perfectoid rings can be regarded as a mixed characteristic analog of the theory of perfect fp algebras i e fp algebras where the frobenius is bijective the utility of this analogy is enhanced by theorem 1 6 by algebraic geometry in mixed characteristic 5 attaching objects with frobenius actions to rings in mixed characteristic this result yields a notion of perfectoidization for a large class of mixed characteristic rings indeed given any perfect prism a i and an a algebra r one can naturally construct a derived perfectoidiza tion r rperfd with excellent formal properties for instance if r is integral over a then r rperfd is in fact the universal map to a perfectoid ring this construction has several appli cations for instance 42 uses these to prove an optimal generalization of the faltings almost purity theorem extending versions from 83 86 202 143 4 as well as the result that zariski closed strongly zariski closed for affinoid perfectoid spaces the latter plays an important role in aspects of 90 the perfectoidization functor also powers the construction of the p adic riemann hilbert functor in 5 remark 1 11 a new perspective on de rham witt complexes 34 the de rham witt complex of bloch deligne illusie 47 135 is a fundamental object in characteristic p algebraic geometry with applications transcending algebra e g 119 its construction traditionally relied on somewhat laborious calculations the paper 34 inspired by structures on relative prismatic cohomology offered a new homological perspective on this object to explain this we first recall the isogeny theorem for prismatic cohomology in the setup of theorem 1 6 when x spf r is affine one often writes r a r x a regarded as an object of the derived category of a there is then a natural quasi isomorphism r a r a l i r a isog induced by the relative frobenius where l i is a variant of the berthelot ogus deligne d calage functor see 38 6 the isomorphism r a which is a prismatic avatar of the berthelot ogus isogeny theorem 18 plays a critical organizational role in capturing the additional structures on r a such as the nygaard filtration the paper 34 shows that when a i is a perfect crystalline prism e g zp p one can reconstruct the de rham witt complex w r from the pair r a r a by a pure homological algebra construction dubbed saturation moreover this construction has the potential to offer a better behaved alternative to the de rham complex for singular varieties in characteristic p analogous to the du bois complex in characteristic 0 we refer to 136 188 for more on these developments remark 1 12 logarithmic analogs the smoothness assumption on x in theorem 1 6 is a good reduction hypothesis while adequate for several purposes this is often too restrictive for studying the generic fibre not every proper smooth scheme x c admits such a smooth model x oc a more natural assumption one that is conjecturally always satisfied up to replacing models would be a form of logarithmic smoothness of x oc e g semistability in the sense of log geometry 139 thus one wants a version of 38 42 in the logarithmic setting this has been accomplished in 62 150 151 it is also possible to approach this problem by reduction to the smooth case using the language of infinite root stacks following ideas of olsson 190 work in progress with mathew remark 1 13 non abelian p adic hodge theory fix a bounded prism a i and a smooth p adic formal a scheme x motivated by the precise form of theorem 1 6 define a prismatic f crystal on x a to be a vector bundle e on x a o equipped with a frobenius structure e e 1 i e 1 i see definition 2 2 for a more explicit description in a variant context prismatic f crystals provide a viable notion of coefficients in the theory somewhat analogous to the role played by harmonic bundles in complex non abelian hodge theory 212 213 in particular given such an f crystal e e the specialization functors used in theorem 1 6 yield a zp local system t e on the rigid generic fibre x when a is perfect a vector bundle edr 6 bhargav bhatt with flat connection on x a an f crystal ecrys on x a a p perf and under certain auxiliary lifting data a higgs bundle ehiggs on x a the relationship realized by these functors is rather close and has been investigated by various authors such as 184 222 29 when a i is a fontaine prism this relationship is part of the p adic simpson correspondence pioneered by faltings 87 88 1 on the other hand if a i is a perfect crystalline prism this relationship yields an alternative perspective on at least the local aspects of the non abelian hodge theory of 189 remark 1 14 extension to the singular case via animation for several applications including most results discussed in this paper it is important to extend the prismatic cohomology con struction r 7 r a see remark 1 11 to possibly singular a algebras r directly imitating definition 1 5 does not produce a computable or useable result instead inspired by the con struction of the cotangent complex and derived de rham cohomology 133 134 as well as their utility in a wide variety of problems 14 19 21 26 132 111 one extends the functor a to ar bitrary p complete a algebras by quillen s non abelian derived functor machinery 194 dubbed animation by clausen 63 as reformulated in 169 the resulting complex r a can be fairly efficiently controlled using the cotangent complex lr a thanks to the animated hodge tate comparison which makes this extension quite useable 2 absolute prismatic cohomology in 1 we fixed a base prism a i and discussed results about the relative prismatic cohomol ogy of a smooth p adic formal a scheme x in this section we describe the picture that arises if one does not fix a base prism a i this distinction is analogous to that between geometric and absolute tale cohomology in arithmetic or that between singular cohomology and deligne beilinson cohomology in hodge theory the objects considered here are newer than those in 1 consequently some results are surely not optimal and we have tried to indicate some natural further directions in the exposition 2 1 definition and key examples to begin let us recall the definition of the absolute pris matic site obtained roughly from definition 1 5 by discarding a i definition 2 1 the absolute prismatic site given a p adic formal scheme x its absolute pris matic site x is the category of all bounded prisms b j equipped with a map spf b j x topologized using the flat topology write o i and o for the sheaves obtained by remember ing b j or b j respectively write r x r x o and r x r x o for the resulting cohomology theories if there exists a perfect prism a i and a map x spf a the natural map x a x is an equivalence so theorem 1 6 describes r x in this case e g r spf a a at the the other end spf zp is the opposite of the category of all bounded prisms as this category has no final object the cohomology theory r spf zp is potentially interesting in fact we shall see in 3 that r spf zp is closely related to the p completed algebraic k theory of zp in this section we shall be interested in the following objects on x definition 2 2 crystals fix a p adic formal scheme x a prismatic crystal resp hodge tate crystal e of vector bundles on x is given by an assignment b j x 7 e b vectb finite projective b modules resp b j x 7 e b vectb j algebraic geometry in mixed characteristic 7 that is compatible with base change in b j x a prismatic f crystal of vector bundles on x is given by a prismatic crystal e with an isomorphism e e 1 i e 1 i of o modules similarly one has analogous notions of crystals of perfect or just p i complete complexes as in the relative case remark 1 13 there are realization functors carrying a prismatic f crystal e on x to a zp local system t e on the rigid generic fibre x a vector bundle edr with flat connection on x and an f crystal ecrys on x zp fp the simplest examples of such crystals are as follows example 2 3 breuil kisin twists for any prism b j one has a naturally defined invertible b module b 1 given heuristically by b 1 j j 2 j this b module comes equipped with a natural isomorphism b 1 b 1 j 1 b 1 so the assignment b j 7 b 1 b 1 gives a prismatic f crystal o 1 o 1 on spf zp and thus on x for any x we refer to this f crystal as the first breuil kisin twist the tale realization of o 1 is identified with the usual tate twist zp 1 example 2 4 gauss manin f crystals fix a proper smooth map f y x of p adic formal schemes the formalism of relative prismatic cohomology yields an f crystal rf o of perfect complexes on x its value on a prism b j x identifies with the relative prismatic complex r y x spf b j b similarly one obtains a hodge tate crystal rf o of perfect complexes on x the formation of rf o resp rf o is compatible with the aforementioned realization functors moreover if y p 1 x then the prismatic logarithm 29 yields a natural isomorphism h 2 rf o o 1 of f crystals giving a geometric description of the breuil kisin twist 2 2 hodge tate crystals in this subsection we fix a perfect field k of characteristic p and write w k spf w k for the absolute prismatic site of w k our goal is to explicitly describe the structure of hodge tate crystals on w k we then specialize this description to the gauss manin case to obtain geometric consequences for the former we have proposition 2 5 sen theory 76 77 29 the category d crys w k o of hodge tate crystals e of p complete complexes on w k can be identified as the category of pairs e consisting of a p complete object e d w k and an endomorphism e e such that p is locally nilpotent on h e p we refer to such pairs e as sen complexes and as the sen operator the implicit functor carrying the crystal e to e d w k in proposition 2 5 is given by evaluating at the object of w k obtained by base changing to w k the f p fixed points of the q de rham prism remark 1 9 remark 2 6 the stacky approach to prismatic crystals 76 29 proposition 2 5 is proven via a stacky approach to prismatic cohomology developed independently in 76 with a precursor in 75 and 29 using a tiny amount of derived algebraic geometry 171 these works attach a stack wcartx the cartier witt stack of x called the prismatization x in 76 on p nilpotent test rings to any p adic formal scheme x this stack comes equipped with an effective cartier divisor wcarthtx wcartx called the hodge tate locus these stacks are devised to geometrize the study of crystals on the prismatic site for quasi syntomic x there is a natural identification of the category d crys x o of crystals of p i complete complexes on x o with the quasi coherent derived category dqc wcartx similarly the category d crys x o of crystals of p complete complexes on x o identifies with the quasi coherent 8 bhargav bhatt derived category dqc wcart ht x proposition 2 5 is then deduced from an explicit description of wcarthtw k as bg for a group scheme g w k whose representations are identified with sen complexes notation 2 7 diffracted hodge cohomology let f x spf w k be a smooth map of p adic formal schemes write r x d x for the sen complex corresponding to the hodge tate crystal rf o d crys w k o via proposition 2 5 we call r x d x the diffracted hodge complex of x the next result says that r x d x is a slightly twisted form of the hodge cohomology complex ir x i x i justifying the name diffracted hodge cohomology theorem 2 8 the sen structure of d x 29 let x w k be a smooth p adic formal scheme then the sen complex r x d x has a natural multiplicative increasing conjugate filtration fil conj equipped with natural isomorphisms griconj r x d x r x i x w k i i for all i theorem 2 8 also shows that the assignment u 7 r u d u patches to a perfect complex d x on x justifying the notation r x d x remark 2 9 relation to classical sen theory 29 fix a proper smooth map f x spf w k of p adic formal schemes write k w k 1 p fix a completed algebraic closure c k and write gk for the absolute galois group of k classical results in p adic hodge theory 209 83 show that for each n 0 the c semilinear gk representation h n xc qp qp c comes equipped with a canonical semisimple endomorphism n whose eigenvalue decomposition yields the hodge tate decomposition we have hn xc qp qp c n i 0 hn i x ix w k w k c i with n acting by i on the i th summand on the right using the comparison isomorphisms in theorem 1 6 one can roughly regard theorem 2 8 as an integral lift of this assertion the value of rf o on the fontaine prism for oc recovers r xc qp qp c on inverting p the sen operator from theorem 2 8 induces the sen operator n on each h n with the conjugate filtration from theorem 2 8 yielding the hodge tate decomposition it was a pleasant surprise to the author that the sen operator admits a nice integral form remark 2 10 drinfeld s refinement of deligne illusie 76 29 in the setup of theorem 2 8 there is a natural identification r x d x p r dr xk compatible with the conjugate fil tration via theorem 1 6 drinfeld observed that the sen operator then yields interesting conse quences for r dr xk more precisely there is a z p grading on r dr xk corresponding to the generalized eigenspace decomposition for the sen operator and the i th conjugate graded piece grconji r xk i xk i contributes only to the generalized eigenspace for i by theorem 2 8 in particular if dim xk p the conjugate filtration on r dr xk splits canoni cally this gives a conceptual new proof in fact a refinement of the seminal deligne illusie result 73 on hodge to de rham degeneration itself inspired by 141 95 83 as in 73 one only needs a w 2 k lift of xk to obtain the sen operator and thus the z p grading on r dr xk this follows from an analysis of wcart ht w 2 k similar to proposition 2 5 the results algebraic geometry in mixed characteristic 9 discussed in this paragraph refine those in 2 by one cohomological degree another stacky proof was recently found in 162 for x w k a smooth formal scheme without any constraints on dim xk one now obtains a residual nilpotent operator i on the generalized eigenspace r dr xk i r dr xk corresponding to the eigenvalue i this operator seems to be a new piece of structure that awaits further investigation 2 3 the nygaard filtration the absolute prismatic cohomology 2 r x of a p adic for mal scheme x carries an important filtration fil n called the nygaard filtration this filtration plays roughly the same role for prismatic cohomology as the hodge filtration does for de rham cohomology moreover for applications to algebraic topology such as theorem 3 8 below it is critical to understand this filtration its defining feature is that the frobenius on r x carries filinr x to r x i i for all i the relative version of this filtration is well under stood at least on graded pieces thanks to the isomorphism isog and the beilinson t structure see 39 proposition 5 8 for the absolute version one has a similar description theorem 2 11 the nygaard fibre sequence 29 for any p adic formal scheme x and any integer i 0 there are natural fibre sequences grinr x fil conj i r x d x i fil conj i 1 r x d x nyg and r x i r x o i r x d x i r x d x ht with the convention that fil conj 0 0 remark 2 12 calculations via the nygaard fibre sequence the sequence nyg is quite useful for calculations of the nygaard filtration for instance in conjunction with the thh variant of theorem 3 2 below see remark 3 3 as well one may use nyg to calculate thh r zp for a p completely smooth ok algebra r where k is a discretely valued extension of qp with perfect residue field this recovers calculations of 54 163 comparing nyg and ht also quantifies the failure of the frobenius map grinr x r x i to be an isomorphism in terms of coherent cohomology thus giving a new mechanism to study the so called segal conjecture for thh remark 2 13 view spec z as a curve several results in mathematics have been inspired by the seemingly nonsensical idea that spec z is a curve over some non existent base f in p adic arithmetic geometry this idea can sometimes lead to useful and testable predictions in conjunction with the following related heuristics perfectoid rings e g finite fields are formally tale over f topologically finite type regular p complete zp algebras r are smooth over f of relative dimension dim r the krull dimension we briefly discuss some examples of such predictions first if r is a perfectoid ring then the p completion of lr zp identifies with r 1 which is consistent with the prediction of a transitivity triangle of cotangent complexes for f z r and the heuristics above this was already essentially observed in 84 next theorem 2 11 was partially conceived based on these heuristics the fibre sequence nyg is obtained as the associated graded of a fibre sequence of filtered complexes allowing one 2 the complex r x as defined in definition 2 1 works well under mild assumptions on the singularities of x e g for lci x in general one modifies the definition of r x by a categorical procedure involving quasi syntomic descent and animation we do not elaborate on this further in this survey and refer to 11 29 for more 10 bhargav bhatt to compute the absolute nygaard filtration in terms of the relative one the underlying fibre sequence of complexes for the latter was guessed based on the analogy between z and a smooth curve over a perfectoid ring next if one views the hodge tate locus wcarthtx wcartx of the cartier witt stack remark 2 6 as a version of the hodge stack i e the classifying stack of the tangent bundle over f then the second heuristic above predicts that wcarthtx is well behaved if x is regular e g the map wcarthtx x should be a gerbe and r must have coherent cohomological dimension at most dim x the first of these predictions is true while the second is true at least in dimension 1 29 relatedly there are some recently defined candidate notions of differential forms relative to f 198 128 80 it would be interesting to find a direct connection between the stack wcarthtx and these objects finally let us remark that the philosophy discussed in this remark also featured in scholze s report for the previous icm 206 and has paid amazing dividends in geometrizing the local langlands correspondence in recent years 207 205 90 remark 2 14 p adic tate twists 39 42 an early observable extracted from absolute pris matic cohomology was a good notion of p adic tate twists zp i in mixed characteristic these are functors on p adic formal schemes x defined by a fibre sequence zp i x fil i nr x i 1 r x i syn for all i 0 these functors are often called syntomic complexes for mixed characteristic rings as they extend those in characteristic p considered in 181 140 one can also regard zp i as as a form of tale motivic cohomology in weight i see the forthcoming remark 3 6 in fact for formally smooth ok schemes with k qp finite the syntomic complexes zp i agree with the p adic tale tate twists of geisser sato schneider 103 200 199 defined by glueing motivic complexes on the generic and special fibres 36 we refer the reader to 39 11 42 29 for more on these syntomic complexes remark 2 15 p adic picard and brauer groups via coherent cohomology the syntomic com plex from remark 2 14 in weight 1 has the following relationship with gm 39 proposition 7 17 as motivic intuition predicts for any p adic formal scheme x we have zp 1 x r xet gm 1 where the completion is p adic plugging this into the sequence syn gives a fibre sequence r xet gm 1 fil 1 nr x 1 1 r x 1 lef that can be regarded as a weak p adic analog of the lefschetz 1 1 theorem e g it enables one to compute the p completion of pic x or br x in terms of absolute prismatic cohomology and thus ultimately via coherent cohomology the idea described in the previous paragraph inspired the eventual proof of a generalization of gabber s purity conjectures for picard and brauer groups in 63 in a global direction cotner and zavyalov have recently used lef to prove the vanishing of pic x for complete intersection surfaces x pn in characteristic p in progress settling a question left open since 109 in a different direction the sequence lef can be used to prove that r 7 r spf r et gm commutes with sifted colimits in r in the p complete world this allows one to reduce general questions about r spf r et gm to particularly nice rings and played an important role in bragg and olsson s work 58 on finiteness results for higher direct images of finite flat group schemes along projective morphisms in characteristic p algebraic geometry in mixed characteristic 11 2 4 galois representations in this subsection fix a discretely valued field k qp with perfect residue field k we discuss the relationship of prismatic f crystals over x spf ok and galois representations of gk gal k k for a prime 6 p the notion of unramifiedness for z or q representations of gk is a galois theoretic analog of the property of having good reduction for varieties over k viewed as an adic local system on spec k an unramified gk representation is exactly one that extends to a local system over spf ok in contrast for zp or qp representations unramifiedness is too restrictive even the cyclotomic character or any nonzero h i yk qp with y ok smooth projective and i 0 is not unramified to remedy this fontaine invented 93 the notion of crystalline gk representations it has been stunningly successful at capturing the desired good reduction intuition on the other hand any prismatic f crystal e on spf ok gives rise to a gk representation t e as well an f crystal ecrys on k see definition 2 2 and following discussion these have the same rank so one may view ecrys as a special fibre of t e suggesting that the prismatic f crystal e itself should be viewed as a witness for a good reduction of t e the following theorem shows that these two perspectives on good reduction for p adic representations coincide theorem 2 16 prismatic f crystals and crystalline gk representations 43 the tale real ization functor e 7 t e gives an equivalence of the category of prismatic f crystals on spf ok with the category of zp lattices in crystalline qp representations of gk thus prismatic f crystals on spf ok provide a reasonable notion for local systems on spf ok with zp coefficients remark 2 17 theorem 2 16 can be viewed as a refinement of kisin s classification of crys talline gk representations 146 in particular this refinement attaches prismatic meaning to the integrality properties of a somewhat mysterious connection in 146 an alternative proof of theorem 2 16 was since given in 78 relying on the theory in 166 see also 230 various results in the deformation theory of gk representations e g 147 81 indicate it would be fruitful to extend the notion of crystalline gk representations to torsion coefficients or even to the derived category however as the property of being crystalline is essentially a rational concept it is not clear how to proceed theorem 2 16 points to a way forward e g perhaps prismatic f crystals with o pn coefficients are a reasonable candidate for crystalline z pn representations while satisfactory for describing zp local systems this approach does not quite lead to a reasonable derived theory as the definition of a prismatic f crystal e e is not quantitative enough the isomorphism e does not come equipped with bounds on its poles zeroes leading to certain poorly behaved ext groups instead the correct objects seem to be perfect complexes on an enlargement of the cartier witt stack wcartok remark 2 6 constructed by drinfeld 76 we describe one piece of evidence for this correctness assertion in the rest of the subsection write d perf wcart ok for the category of perfect complexes on the stack spf ok from 76 1 8 let us call such objects prismatic f gauges on ok 3 given such an f gauge e write r wcart ok e for its global sections to a first approximation a prismatic f gauge e consists of a prismatic f crystal e of perfect complexes on wcartok equipped with the additional datum of a nygaard style filtration on r wcartok e in fact this can be made precise if ok is replaced by a qrsp ring work in progress with lurie the prismatic f crystals from examples 2 3 and 2 4 have natural lifts to prismatic f gauges the promised piece of evidence is the following result 3 the definition of wcart ok in 76 denoted ok there is inspired by the fontaine jansen theory 94 of f gauges in crystalline cohomology 12 bhargav bhatt theorem 2 18 a lagrangian property 30 assume k is unramified let e d perf wcart ok be a prismatic f gauge with o linear dual d e and tale realization t e in an appropriate de rived category of continuous zp representations of gk then the natural map r wcart ok e r gk t e is the exact annihilator of the corresponding map of local tate duals i e there is a natural fibre sequence r wcart ok e r gk t e r wcart ok d e 1 2 lag where rhomzp zp on the rightmost term theorem 2 18 is work in progress with lurie 30 the statement is likely not quite optimal yet e g we hope to show it for ramified k as well remark 2 19 the crystalline part of galois cohomology given a qp representation v of gk bloch kato constructed 51 3 the crystalline part h 1 f gk v h 1 gk v of the galois cohomology of v and proved that the crystalline parts for v and v 1 are orthogonal complements under the tate duality pairing when v is crystalline theorem 2 18 may be viewed as an integral and cochain level variant of this statement such integral refinements have been formulated previously in special cases e g 102 it would be interesting to compare them to theorem 2 18 remark 2 20 the analogy with 3 manifolds in the mazur mumford analogy between num ber rings and 3 manifolds 180 158 the scheme spec k corresponds to a riemann surface while spf ok corresponds to a 3 manifold m with boundary m a standard topological result states that the space loc of local systems on has a symplectic structure induced by poincar duality on and the restriction map loc m loc is lagrangian see 96 propo sition 3 27 the sequence lag may be viewed as an arithmetic analogue of the infinitesimal form of this result with the role of a local system on spf ok played by prismatic f gauges in fact this picture motivated the discovery of theorem 2 18 remark 2 21 lichtenbaum quillen for ok the breuil kisin prismatic f gauges o i com pute the p adic tate twists from remark 2 14 i e we have natural identifications r wcart ok o i zp i ok using the vanishing of zp i for i 0 the sequence lag then implies that the natural map zp i ok r gk zp i is an equivalence for i 2 under the relationship of either side to the tale k theory of ok and k as well as the localization sequence in k theory this result was essentially known 119 nevertheless theorem 2 18 provides a different conceptual explanation 3 algebraic k theory quillen s algebraic k theory 193 functor attaches a space in fact a spectrum k x to a scheme x generalizing the construction of the grothendieck group k 0 x the study of these invariants and their generalizations is an important pursuit in modern algebraic topology in fact its impact extends far beyond algebraic topology the higher k groups ki x feature prominently in some of the deepest conjectures in arithmetic geometry in this section we report on some recent progress in understanding the structural features of the p completed algebraic k theory spectrum k r zp of a p complete ring r with an emphasis on connections to prismatic cohomology the case of adic completions for 6 p is classical going back to work of thomason algebraic geometry in mixed characteristic 13 221 suslin 217 and gabber 98 more complete recent surveys of material covered in this section include 120 121 179 in classical algebraic topology combining the atiyah hirzeburch spectral sequence with bott periodicity gives the following structure on the complex k theory ktop x of a reasonable topological space x the k theory spectrum ktop x admits a natural filtration with gri identified with the shifted singular cohomology complex r x z 2 i filtk in recent work motivated in part by conjectures of beilinson 13 and hesselholt a p adic ana log of filtk for tale sheafified algebraic k theory of p complete rings has been established with the role of singular cohomology now played by prismatic cohomology to explain this bet ter recall that algebraic topologists often study algebraic k theory through a cyclotomic trace map tr k tc where tc is the topological cyclic homology functor this invariant of rings was invented by contemplating hochschild homology over the sphere spectrum goes back to 55 and was recently given a simple categorical definition in 186 the trace map is a powerful calculational tool see 117 118 119 104 for some successes and there are two main reasons for this first tc is built via a rather elaborate homotopical procedure from objects of coherent cohomology namely differential forms and is thus potentially more computable than k theory secondly the trace map turns out to yield a very good approximation of k theory in various situations in our p adic context the state of the art is the following theorem 3 1 p adic tale k theory is tc 66 65 for p complete rings r the trace map k r zp tc r zp identifies the target with the p completed tale sheafified k theory of r moreover the tale sheafification is not necessary in sufficiently large degrees if r satisfies mild finiteness conditions via theorem 3 1 the following result can be viewed as a p adic analog of the atiyah hirzebuch part of filtk theorem 3 2 the motivic filtration on tale k theory 39 11 as a functor on p complete rings there is a natural motivic filtration on tc zp with gr i mottc zp naturally identi fied with the shifted syntomic complex zp i 2 i from remark 2 14 remark 3 3 variants for thh and cousins let us briefly recall the 186 approach to cal culating tc for a commutative ring r the p completed topological hochschild homology spectrum thh r zp comes equipped with a natural action of the circle s 1 and a certain frobenius map one can then define auxiliary invariants tc r zp thh r zp hs 1 and tp r zp thh r zp ts 1 together with two natural maps can tc r zp tp r zp the paper 186 then proves there is a natural fibre sequence tc r zp tc r zp can tp r zp tc thereby yielding a clean modern construction of tc r zp the construction of the motivic filtration on tc zp in theorem 3 2 is sufficiently flexi ble to ensure that similar ideas also yield compatible motivic filtrations on tc r zp and tp r zp in fact 39 lifts the sequence tc to a filtered fibre sequence that recovers the se quence syn on associated graded pieces up to nygaard completions in particular one recovers 14 bhargav bhatt nygaard completed absolute prismatic cohomology as the associated graded of a filtration on tp note that while thh and cousins are non commutative invariants i e can be defined for arbitrary stable categories the construction of the motivic filtration crucially uses algebraic geometry it is unclear if analogous filtrations exist even in slightly more general settings e g for tc c for a symmetric monoidal stable category c remark 3 4 comparison with the hodge filtration on classical hochschild homology the topological hochschild homology of a commutative ring r is defined as thh r hh r s i e it is the hochschild homology relative to the sphere spectrum s from this optic theorem 3 2 and the variants in remark 3 3 are analogs of known constructions in the hochschild homology of ordinary rings for instance given a smooth algebra r over a commutative ring k there is a natural filtration on hc r k hh r k hs 1 with gri identified with the hodge filtration level filihodge r k 2 i see 167 5 1 2 and 228 for characteristic 0 and 39 5 2 and 9 in general specializing to k a for a fontaine prism a i this allows one to recover crystalline and de rham cohomology but not tale cohomology of the generic fibre as graded pieces of a natural filtration on classical hochschild homology and its variants theorem 3 2 and the variants in remark 3 3 thus contain the surprise that working relative to the sphere spectrum permits one to see the tale cohomology of the generic fibre as well one can in fact recover prismatic cohomology remark 3 5 origin story let a i be a fontaine prism example 1 4 write acrys for the ring obtained by formally adjoining divided powers of i to a in the p complete setting given a smooth proper scheme x over oc a its absolute crystalline cohomology r crys x is a perfect complex of acrys modules with a frobenius structure the relation between the theory of breuil modules 59 and breuil kisin modules 146 in galois representation theory strongly suggested that r crys x ought to descend naturally along a acrys separately hesselholt had calculated 116 that 0 tp oc zp equals a comparing this to the known fact that 0 hp oc zp equals acrys up to a completion it was natural to speculate that for any x oc as above one could find a filtration on tp x zp whose graded pieces realize the desired descent of r crys x along a acrys this eventually led to the tp variant of theorem 3 2 and gave a construction of prismatic cohomology over the fontaine and breuil kisin prisms 39 11 in fact as tp zp is independent of the base oc this also gave the first construction of absolute prismatic cohomology 39 7 3 remark 3 6 tale motivic cohomology we briefly explain why theorem 3 2 can be viewed as a p completed and tale sheafified analog of the filtration of algebraic k theory by motivic cohomology defined via bloch s higher chow groups 48 recall that the latter geometric motivic filtration was conjectured to exist in 13 and established in many cases including most smooth cases in 52 97 227 159 see 129 for a clean construction it is thus natural to conjecture that the p completed tale sheafification of this geometric motivic filtration identifies with the one in theorem 3 2 for smooth varieties over a perfect field k of characteristic p this is indeed the case by combining 106 and 39 in mixed characteristic while we do not know the full story a positive answer at the associated graded level follows from the comparison result from 36 mentioned in remark 2 14 let us also remark that 168 has established the expected relationship of milnor k theory extended as in 145 and the i i part of the syntomic complexes giving a p adic analog of 185 225 the above discussion raises a natural question as theorem 3 2 applies to any p complete ring can the domain of definition of the geometric motivic filtration of the previous paragraph also be extended to all p complete rings in particular is there a meaningful geometric motivic filtration algebraic geometry in mixed characteristic 15 on k r for a non reduced p complete ring r thanks to a forthcoming result of mathew on glueing the filtration from theorem 3 2 with the tale sheafified postnikov filtration on k 1 local k theory there is a variant of theorem 3 2 for any ring so one may even reasonably ask these questions for all rings remark 3 7 constructing the motivic filtration via quasisyntomic descent the construction of the motivic filtration in theorem 3 2 is quite different from that of the geometric motivic filtration mentioned in remark 3 6 indeed the general case of theorem 3 2 is proven in 11 see also 29 by reducing via animation as in remark 1 14 to the quasisyntomic case treated in 39 the latter has two essential ingredients the topological ingredient is b kstedt s fundamental periodicity result 53 that thh fp fp u for a degree 2 class u see 153 for a quick modern proof based on properties of the dual steenrod algebra 91 for an overview of other approaches and 120 for a deduction of bott periodicity from b kstedt periodicity the new algebraic input is the flat descent property 19 39 of the cotangent complex used in conjunction with the very perfectoid idea going back in spirit to 95 that working with certain infinitely ramified covers can discretize constructions involving differential forms in the p adic world as remark 3 5 explains the first construction of absolute prismatic cohomology was through theorem 3 2 and variants however thanks to the alternative and more direct construction via the prismatic site one can now use theorem 3 2 as a tool to study k theory via prismatic cohomology for instance this approach gives the following result theorem 3 8 the odd vanishing theorem 42 for odd i the functor ik zp is quasi syntomic locally 0 on the category of quasi syntomic rings theorem 3 8 can be regarded as a variant of the bott periodicity part of filtk in the algebraic setting while periodicity is known to be false due to geometric phenomena we still have vanishing in odd degrees the proof in 42 relies on andr s flatness lemma 3 and it would be interesting to find a more explicit description of the necessary covers remark 3 9 further relations to p adic arithmetic geometry another application of prismatic cohomology to k theory was proving that lk 1 k r lk 1 k r 1 p for any associative ring r 27 this equality is a k theoretic avatar of the tale comparison from 42 and was proved in 27 via explicit calculations in prismatic cohomology it has since been reproved and significantly extended using purely homotopy theoretic methods in 156 in the reverse direction and preceding most of the developments reported in this paper 49 used results from topological cyclic homology 105 to prove the infinitesimal portion of the p adic variational hodge conjecture in the unramified case the extension to the ramified case was recently obtained in 11 as a consequence of a purely k theoretic assertion called the beilinson fibre square using this square and theorem 3 2 11 also gave a simple description of the rationalized syntomic complexes zp i 1 p via derived de rham cohomology this description is quite useful as derived de rham cohomology is more computable in practice than prismatic cohomology in fact this description formed an essential ingredient in the classification of crystalline representations given in theorem 2 16 the connections discussed above have mostly concerned relative prismatic cohomology it seems likely that a better understanding of absolute prismatic cohomology as in 2 will lead to more refined applications for instance 164 recovers rather conceptually the highly non trivial calculation 119 of the k theory of local fields k qp by exploiting certain covers of the final object in the absolute prismatic topos of ok coming from breuil kisin prisms other related observations are discussed in remark 2 12 and remark 2 21 16 bhargav bhatt 4 commutative algebra and birational geometry the kodaira vanishing theorem as well as the generalization by kawamata viehweg is one of the most important foundational results in complex algebraic geometry it is especially useful in birational geometry its original proof relies crucially on hodge theory and thus no longer applies in positive mixed characteristic in fact the result is known to be false in those settings 195 alongside the non availability of resolution of singularities in dimensions 4 this is a ma jor obstacle to progress in birational geometry in postive mixed characteristic about a decade ago schwede observed 208 that methods from f singularity theory in positive characteristic commutative algebra can sometimes be used as a substitute for the use of vanishing theorems in positive characteristic algebraic geometry this eventually led to significant progress in birational geometry in positive characteristic in dimension 3 such as 113 in recent years input from p adic hodge theory has made it possible to prove similar vanishing theorems in mixed charac teristic algebraic geometry this has led to solutions of longstanding questions in commutative algebra and also to progress in the minimal model program in mixed characteristic 4 1 vanishing theorems in commutative algebra f singularity theory is the study of singularities in positive characteristic via the behaviour of the frobenius endomorphism it was born with a classical theorem of kunz 155 proving that a noetherian fp algebra is regular exactly when its frobenius endomorphism is flat this subject was systematically developed by hochster huneke and several others over many decades see 125 as well as the survey 218 an important landmark in the subject was a cohen macaulayness result of hochster huneke 126 see 130 for a fairly recent survey the following recent result extends this to mixed characteristic theorem 4 1 cohen macaulayness of r 25 35 let r be an excellent noetherian domain let r be the integral closure of r in an algebraic closure of its fraction field then the p adic completion r is cohen macaulay over r remark 4 2 a concrete formulation despite involving the large ring r theorem 4 1 is a finitistic statement whose essential content is the following if r is local and x p x 1 xd is a system of parameters then any relation on x becomes a linear combination of the trivial koszul relations in a finite extension s of r this formulation explains why theorem 4 1 can be viewed as a vanishing theorem up to finite covers it says that the local cohomology classes on r coming from the potentially non trivial relations can be annihilated by passing to finite extensions r s moreover it also highlights the essential difficulty one must construct finite extensions of r from the unwanted relations remark 4 3 weakly functorial cohen macaulay algebras andr s recent resolution 3 4 of hochster s direct summand conjecture led to a lot of activity in mixed characteristic commutative algebra including 23 175 176 114 211 178 see 177 for a recent survey in particular andr 6 and gabber 99 proved the existence of weakly functorial cohen macaulay algebras in the key remaining mixed characteristic case via rather indirect constructions this existence result implies many of the homological conjectures in commutative algebra a notable exception being serre s intersection multiplicity conjecture see 124 5 122 prior to andr and gabber s work this existence was known 123 115 only in dimension 3 theorem 4 1 now yields an alternative and extremely simple construction of such weakly functorial cohen macaulay algebras in mixed characteristic we may simply use r remark 4 4 what was known theorem 4 1 is straightforward in dimension 2 and is the main result of 126 in the positive characteristic case in mixed characteristic theorem 4 1 is new even in dimension 3 it was previously known 115 in dimension 3 only in the almost algebraic geometry in mixed characteristic 17 category in the sense of faltings almost mathematics 83 100 see 25 remark 1 9 for an explanation of prior expectations remark 4 5 splinters a noetherian commutative ring r is called a splinter if it satisfies the conclusion of the direct summand conjecture i e it splits off as a module from every finite extension this class of singularities formally introduced in 172 has recently received renewed attention e g 173 10 70 7 an external reason to care about this notion is a major conjecture in f singularity theory 126 page 85 127 page 640 splinters in characteristic p are expected to be the same as strongly f regular rings see 174 end of 3 for a discussion this conjecture is known for q gorenstein rings 214 one consequence of this conjecture is that characteristic p splinters are derived splinters i e they satisfy a derived version of the splinter condition for any proper surjective map and are thus analogous to rational singularities this consequence was proven unconditionally in 20 methods from 31 used in proving theorem 4 1 give the same result in mixed characteristic in conjunction with theorem 4 1 itself one learns that that any mixed characteristic splinter is cohen macaulay and has rational singularities in the sense of 152 it would be interesting to prove the latter even just after inverting p without using p adic hodge theory remark 4 6 ingredients in the proof of theorem 4 1 using essentially elementary methods 35 reduces theorem 4 1 to the statement that r p is cohen macaulay over r p which is proven in 25 despite the simple reformulation highlighted in remark 4 2 the proof relies on two major theoretical inputs the first is prismatic cohomology theorem 1 6 which gives a substitute for the frobenius operator in mixed characteristic this allows one to begin mimicking the cohomological proof of 126 given in 131 in mixed characteristic at the cost of replacing rings with derived rings the second is the p adic riemann hilbert functor from theorem 5 1 below applied to certain perverse fp sheaves on the generic fibre spec r 1 p arising from finite covers to facilitate the induction on dimension strategy of 131 this proof is not effective and it might be interesting to explicitly constructed the relevant covers in low dimensional examples such as cones over smooth projective curves and surfaces over a p adic discrete valuation ring 4 2 birational geometry there is a well known analogy between projective geometry and local algebra e g the global cohomological properties of a projective variety x pn are faithfully reflected in the local cohomological properties of its affine cone y an 1 over x near the vertex 0 y this analogy suggests that theorem 4 1 ought to have a global variant this is indeed the case and the result can be summarized as follows theorem 4 7 kodaira vanishing up to finite covers 25 let v be a p adic discrete valuation ring e g v zp let x v be a flat proper scheme equipped with a semiample and big line bundle l then any p power torsion class in h x l 1 h x ox or h x l can be annihilated by pullback to a finite cover of x analogous results hold true in the relative setting 25 and were previously known in charac teristic p 126 for l ample and 20 in general remark 4 8 relation to kodaira vanishing the classical kodaira vanishing theorem says that h dim y y m 1 0 for a smooth projective variety y c with ample line bundle m this assertion is false in char acteristic p 195 and mixed characteristic by totaro see 35 footnote 1 the l 1 case of theorem 4 7 can be viewed as an up to finite covers variant of the kodaira vanishing theorem that is true in mixed characteristic spurious cohomology classes ones that should not be there if kodaira vanishing were true for x l can be annihilated by passing to finite covers 18 bhargav bhatt this up to finite covers perspective was pioneered in characteristic p by 215 in the wake of 126 for completeness we remark that an up to finite covers version of the more general kodaira akizuki nakano vanishing theorem also holds true in the setting of theorem 4 7 in fact the cases not covered by theorem 4 7 are much easier as sheaves of differential forms themselves become p divisible on passage to finite covers remark 4 9 relation to the p adic poincar lemma the assertion in theorem 4 7 for h x ox with finite covers weakened to alterations was previously known by 14 22 in fact it formed the key geometric ingredient in the proof of the p adic poincar lemma in 14 curiously while the p adic poincar lemma was used in 14 to give a new proof of the fundamental de rham comparison conjecture in p adic hodge theory the proof of theorem 4 7 uses the full strength of modern advances in p adic hodge theory such as the primitive comparison theorem of 203 for arbitrarily singular varieties we end this section with an application of theorem 4 7 to birational geometry in mixed characteristic briefly it is possible to use this variant of kodaira vanishing in a critical lifting argument in an inductive proof of the existence of flips in dimension 3 following 113 which goes back to ideas of shokurov combining this with witaszek s recent mixed characteristic analog 229 of keel s semiampleness theorems 144 it became possible to emulate the ideas of 113 44 45 69 amongst others to show the following theorem 4 10 minimal model program in mixed characteristic 35 219 one can run the minimal model program for arithmetic threefolds whose residue characteristics are 5 theorem 4 10 uses ideas from 46 178 and extends 220 142 global geometric applications of the ideas going into theorem 4 10 can be found in 35 219 112 216 231 remark 4 11 the stable sections we informally discuss a new notion introduced in the proof of theorem 4 10 in a simple case and state a question see 35 4 or 219 3 2 for the general notion for reasonable mixed characteristic rings r one can define a submodule b 0 r r r of the dualizing module r it is the submodule of elements that lift to all alterations of spec r under the trace maps if r is regular then b 0 r r r so in general b 0 r r is an invariant measuring the singularities of r analogous invariants exist in characteristic 0 given by the grauert riemenschneider sheaf 157 example 4 3 12 and characteristic p given by the parameter test submodule 46 2 5 corollary 3 4 basic properties of b 0 r r such as its behaviour under alterations or restriction to divisors play a key role in the proof of theorem 4 10 however a fundamental question about these invariants remains open does their formation commute with localization due to the infinite intersection implicit in the definition of b 0 r r this question is delicate nevertheless a positive answer which we expect would have several geometric applications as evidence for a positive answer using theorem 5 4 one can show the claim for inverting p the localization b 0 r r 1 p agrees with the grauert riemenschneider sheaf of spec r 1 p work in progress as a sequel to 35 we refer to 112 8 for more discussion of this question 5 p adic riemann hilbert the riemann hilbert problem has a rich history going back at least to hilbert s 21 st problem in modern terms it asked if any c local system on a smooth complex algebraic curve x can be realized as the solution system of a flat vector bundle on x with regular singularities at this variant was precisely formulated and solved by deligne in 71 which also contained a higher dimensional analog soon after this picture was significantly generalized by kashiwara algebraic geometry in mixed characteristic 19 and mebkhout there is a natural equivalence of categories between topological objects c linear perverse sheaves and differential objects regular holonomic d modules on any smooth complex variety see 56 in this section we discuss joint work with lurie towards a p adic analog of the preceding story our aim was to extend existing results attaching flat connections to p adic local systems on p adic varieties such as 87 88 1 203 165 74 to p adic constructible complexes and in particular to p adic perverse sheaves unlike the complex picture there are several meanings one can attach to p adic sheaves one can work with z pn zp or qp coefficients our theorem for fp coefficients is the following the z p n case is analogous theorem 5 1 riemann hilbert for torsion coefficients 31 let c qp be a complete and algebraically closed extension let x oc be a finite type scheme then there is a natural exact functor rh dbcons xc fp d b qc x oc oc p this functor commutes with proper pushforward intertwines verdier and grothendieck duality in the almost category 83 100 and interacts well with the perverse t structure the functor rh above also almost commutes with tensor products and pullbacks provided the target is refined to rh fp modules in fact it is possible to refine the target further to frobenius modules over the tilt rh fp the resulting functor is fully faithful and agrees with the construction in 33 which was a dual form of 82 that works for all characteristic p schemes when x has characteristic p remark 5 2 relation to existing work in p adic geometry theorem 5 1 appears to be the first general construction attaching coherent objects to constructible fp sheaves on algebraic varieties in characteristic 0 on the other hand several ingredients that go into the proof have appeared before in p adic arithmetic geometry indeed the functor rh can be regarded as a generalization of a perfectoidization functor from remark 1 10 to non constant coefficients one can almost identify rh fp with ox perfd p moreover the compatibility with duality with constant coefficients is closely related to the gabber zavyalov approach 232 to poincar duality for the fp cohomology of rigid spaces nevertheless the flexibility of applying rh to non constant perverse coefficients is immensely useful in applications including theorems 4 1 and 4 7 or the localization result mentioned in remark 4 11 relatedly let us mention that theorem 5 1 itself suffices to prove theorem 4 1 in the almost category extending heitmann s almost vanishing theorem 115 to arbitrary dimensions prima facie theorem 5 1 looks quite different from the complex riemann hilbert corre spondence the output is a quasicoherent and in fact almost coherent complex rather than a d module in fact the functor in theorem 5 1 is better understood as a p adic analog of a construction from saito s fundamental work 197 on mixed hodge modules recall that this theory gives a filtered refinement of the classical riemann hilbert functor for many constructible sheaves including those that are of geometric origin more precisely given a smooth proper complex variety x any mixed hodge module on x has an underlying dx module equipped with a hodge filtration as well as an underlying perverse sheaf the picture relating them can be 20 bhargav bhatt summarized in the following commutative diagram mhm x forget ww forget dbcons x c rhcl dfcoh dx gr forget xx dbcoh gr t x dbcoh gr x db dx where mhm x is saito s category of mixed hodge modules dfcoh dx is a suitable derived category of dx modules equipped with a good filtration the functor rh cl is the classical riemann hilbert functor the functor gr is the associated graded construction carrying a filtered d module to a graded ox module with an action of gr dx sym tx i e a higgs module and the functor is the graded higgs complex construction heuristically the functor in theorem 5 1 is an analog of the composite correspondence dbcons x c forget mhm x gr forget dbcoh gr x r h for fp coefficients slightly surprisingly unlike in the complex story we get an honest functor instead of a correspondence in the p adic setting on the other hand objects of mhm x also have a weight filtration which we ignore in our discussion remark 5 3 why is there no grading in comparison with the correspondence r h there is no grading in the target of theorem 5 1 but this is to be expected the grading on the target of r h reflects the fact that objects in mhm x are fairly motivic in nature e g they give variations of hodge structures on an open subset of x in contrast in theorem 5 1 we are working with all constructible sheaves over the algebraically closed field c so there is no motivicity or even a galois action the previous discussion suggests it might be useful to lift theorem 5 1 to qp coefficients and restrict to sheaves defined over a discretely valued field so there is a galois action in order to obtain a p adic variant of r h this can indeed be done and the resulting structure seems slightly cleaner than r h theorem 5 4 riemann hilbert for qp coefficients 32 let k qp be a finite extension let x k be a smooth proper variety then there is a natural exact functor rhd d b wht x qp dfcoh dx where the source is a full subcategory of dbcons x qp spanned by what we call weakly hodge tate sheaves including all sheaves of geometric origin this functor commutes with proper pushforward intertwines verdier and grothendieck duality and interacts well with the perverse t structure theorem 5 4 represents ongoing work in progress with lurie and the statement above is not quite optimal e g there is a variant for singular x remark 5 5 the case of local systems the functor rhd from theorem 5 4 is not really new for local systems up to a certain nilpotent operator encoding that a weakly hodge tate local system is not quite de rham it coincides with the one appearing in 165 theorem 1 5 and is thus related to constructions from 203 see also 87 1 74 however for geometric applications such as example 5 7 below it is critical to apply rhd to constructible complexes that are not local systems algebraic geometry in mixed characteristic 21 remark 5 6 why is the hodge filtration automatic theorem 5 4 implies that constructible qp sheaves f of geometric origin on a variety x k as above have a functorially attached filtered dx module m rhd f i e the hodge filtration on the dx module m is actually deter mined by f unlike in the correspondence r h this discrepancy is ultimately because the con structible sheaves in theorem 5 4 carry galois symmetries as they are defined over k moreover this is perfectly consistent with known phenomena in p adic hodge theory that stem ultimately from the richness of the absolute galois group gk of k for instance when x spec k and f rf qp for a smooth proper map f y x we are simply observing that the gk representation h yk qp knows the de rham cohomology of h dr y k as a filtered vector space and in particular knows the hodge numbers of x via the de rham comparison see 137 for a purely geometric application of this fact as theorem 5 4 gives an honest functor one can now directly apply rhd to deep theorems on the constructible side such as the bbdg decomposition theorem 16 to obtain highly nontrivial results on the coherent side this mechanism appears robust enough to yield some results in birational geometry that are traditionally best understood via mixed hodge module theory e g koll r s vanishing theorems 148 149 see 201 25 for the hodge module proof we sketch the argument for vanishing next to illustrate this idea example 5 7 recovering koll r vanishing p adically fix a finite extension k qp say f y x is a projective surjective morphism of proper k varieties of dimensions dy and dx respectively with y smooth consider the functor rh dbwht y qp d b coh gr y obtained by composing the functor rhd from theorem 5 4 with gr as in r h essentially by the local hodge tate decomposition of 203 we have rh qp dy i iy k dy i with its natural grading so i forms have weight i if y were singular one would have a similar formula with the deligne du bois variants iy k of differential forms as in 79 and 191 7 3 on the right by 110 pushing forward along f using the proper pushforward compatibility of rh and extracting the weight dy summand gives rh rf qp dy wt dy rf y on the other hand the decomposition theorem 16 72 shows that rf qp dy dy dx i dy dx phi i n where each phi is perverse and n is a summand of rg qp dy with g yz z x being the restriction of f over the closed subvariety z x where f is not smooth the singular variant of the reasoning just used for f applied to g then shows that rh rg qp dy wt dy rg dy yz 0 where the last vanishing follows as dyyz 0 since dy dim yz see 110 for a purely p adic proof of this property of deligne du bois complexes but then the same vanishing is also true 22 bhargav bhatt for the summand n of rg qp dy so we learn that rf y rh rf qp dy wt dy dy dx i dy dx rh hi i wt dy the perverse exactness properties of rh now imply that the i th summand on the right lies in d i whence rf y d dy dx as i dy dx i e rjf y 0 for j dy dx proving the koll r vanishing theorem 148 theorem 2 1 from this perspective one answer to koll r s question why is y better behaved than oy 149 could be the following as y is the highest hodge tate weight summand of rh qp dy it does not see interference from smaller dimensional varieties when moved around via operations such as rf acknowledgements the landscape of algebraic geometry in mixed characteristic has changed substantially in the last decade i feel extremely fortunate to have had the opportunity to witness many aspects of this metamorphosis up close i am thus eternally indebted
