relative algebraic k theory by elementary means ar x iv 1 31 0 86 44 v 2 m at h k t 1 6 f eb 2 01 6 relative algebraic k theory by elementary means daniel r grayson abstract in a previous paper i gave a presentation for the quillen higher al gebraick groups of an exact category in terms of acyclic binary multicomplexes in this paper i take that presentation as a definition of the higher k groups generalize it to the relative k groups of an exact functor between exact cate gories and produce the corresponding long exact sequence by elementary means without homotopy theory introduction the paper 1 provided the first presentation by generators and relations for the higher algebraic k groups of quillen which are defined as homotopy groups of certain spaces constructed by combinatorial means from the algebraic situation under consideration the generators and relations involve ingredients just a bit more complicated than the notion of chain complex from homological algebra a fundamental aspect of algebraic k theory is the construction and use of long exact sequences of algebraic k groups such as those provided by the localization theorem for abelian categories or the localization theorem for projective modules of quillen the most general of these is the long exact sequence kn 1 n kn 1 f knm knn for an exact functor f m n involving the relative k groups of f which are also defined as homotopy groups this paper 1 presents a conjectural presentation for the relativek groups adopts it as a definition and then uses it directly to construct the long exact sequence by elementary means without homotopy theory hence the long exact sequence of relative k theory in algebraic k theory is intermediate in complexity between the long exact sequence in homotopy theory and the long exact sequence in homological algebra the result can also be viewed as an imaginary reconstruction of history providing a step toward an approach 2000 mathematics subject classification

techniques developed here for computing with the presentation provided here can serve as tools for the construction of useful new long exact sequences of k groups i intend to settle the conjecture 1 6 in a future paper acknowledgments i thank the university of bielefeld where much of this work was done for its hospitality the national science foundation for support under grant nsf dms 10 02171 and the oswald veblen fund and the bell companies fellowship for supporting my stay at the institute for advanced study in 2013 2014 where the paper was written 1 basic constructions in 1 definition 1 4 we defined what it means for an exact category n to support long exact sequences what a long exact sequence of n is 1 definition 1 1 and what a quasi isomorphism of n is 1 definition 2 6 any exact category can be converted to one that supports long exact sequences by adding objects representing images of idempotent maps and the conversion changes only k 0 n the advantage of working in such a category is that all the usual statements from homological algebra about exactness of bounded chain complexes hold 1 text after definition 1 4 without further comment we assume that the exact categories mentioned here all support long exact sequences in 1 are various results that state that the constructions we use for making new exact categories from old ones for example categories of chain complexes or binary chain complexes preserve the property of supporting long exact sequences similar statements hold for the slightly more advanced constructions of this paper we let grn denote the exact category of bounded z graded objects n of n as in 1 definition 2 1 remark 2 2 for an exact category n we let cn denote the exact category of bounded chain complexes n d of objects of n and as in 1 definition 3 1 we let bn denote the exact category of bounded binary chain complexes n d d of objects of n here d is the top differential and d is the bottom differential we also introduce c 2 n as an abbreviation for cn 2 the category of pairs n d n d of pairs of chain complexes of objects of n because its use alternates so often with the use of bn we introduce the following exact functors relative algebraic k theory by elementary means 3 cn gr grn n d n bn gr grn n d d n cn c 2 n n d n d n d cn bn n d n d d bn cn n d d n d bn cn n d d n d bn c 2 n n d d n d n d c 2 n c 2 n n d n d n d n d bn bn n d d n d d an object in the image of a functor is called diagonal when it is likely to cause little confusion we identify an object of bn with its image under but beware the faithful functor bn c 2 n is not full because a map m c c n d d in bn is a single mapm n in grn that commutes with both differentials in any of our exact categories we let i denote the subcategory of isomorphisms and in any of our exact categories of chain complexes or binary chain complexes etc we let q denote the subcatgory of quasi isomorphisms as explained in the second paragraph of 1 section 4 the map kn kqcn arising from the embedding n cn is a homotopy equivalence of spectra now we pass to relative k theory for an exact functor f m n between exact categories and we introduce several definitions definition 1 1 let c f be the exact category of triples x m n u where m cm n cn and u fm n is a quasi isomorphism of cn a map x x is a pair f g consisting of maps f m m and g n n such that u ff g u we call u the comparison map we introduce the notations xsrc m xtar n and xcomp u definition 1 2 let b f be the exact category of triples x m n u where m c 2 m n bn and u fm n is a quasi isomorphism of c 2 n we call u the comparison map a map m n u m n u is a pair f g consisting of maps f m m in c 2 m and g n n in bn such that u ff g u we introduce the notations xsrc m xtar n xcomp u and the following exact functors 4 daniel r grayson c f b f m n u m n u b f c f m n u m n u b f c f m n u m n u b f c f 2 m n u m n u b f b f m n u m n u here f 2 f f m 2 n 2 and we freely identify such categories as c m 2 and cm 2 for x c f or x b f we say that x is acyclic if xsrc and xtar are acyclic definition 1 3 let p c f be the subcategory whose arrows f x x are those where fsrc xsrc x src is a quasi isomorphism of cm and ftar xtar x tar is an isomorphism of cn identifying f with the pair fsrc ftar q i suggests the mnemonic notation q i for p observe that pc f is an exact category with weak equivalences in the sense of 1 definition a 1 the category p does not satisfy the cylinder axiom of waldhausen 2 1 6 because the rear projection of a mapping cylinder in cn is not an isomorphism definition 1 4 let p q i b f be the subcategory whose arrows f x x are those where fsrc xsrc x src is a quasi isomorphism of c 2 m and ftar xtar x tar is an isomorphism of bn observe that pb f is an exact category with weak equivalences and that pc f pb f is an exact functor the category p does not satisfy the cylinder axiom of waldhausen a helpful mnemonic may be to view pb f as a sort of homotopy pullback of the diagram ibn qc 2 m f qc 2 n definition 1 5 let f denote the pair pb f f pc f of exact categories with weak equivalences where pair has the meaning adopted in 1 definition 4 1 relative algebraic k theory by elementary means 5 and in the text after 1 definition a 3 we point the arrow leftward to emphasize the role of its target a helpful mnemonic may be to view f as a sort of homotopy pullback of the diagram ibn icn 1 qc 2 m qcm f qc 2 n qcn conjecture 1 6 passing to k theory gives the following homotopy pullback square k f k ibn icn 1 km k qc 2 m qcm kf k qc 2 n qcn kn the upper right hand corner in the square above was shown to be contractible in 1 proof of theorem 4 3 commutativity of the square up to homotopy is provided by the maps u which are in q recalling the definition 1 definition a 4 observe that the grothendieck group k 0 f is the quotient of k 0 b f that equates objects in the image of f to 0 and equates the source and the target of maps in p alternatively and better for our purposes is to take that description as the definition of k 0 f the following theorem is our main result the proof will be given later theorem 1 7 given an exact functor f m n between exact categories that support long exact sequences the sequence k 0 0 m k 0 0 n k 0 m f n edbc gf a k 0 m 0 k 0 n 0 of abelian groups induced by the maps of pairs 0 m 1 f 0 n 0 1 m f n 1 0 m 0 f 1 n 0 is exact recall the notations bqn and cqn for the subcategories of acyclic objects in bn and cn respectively introduced in the last paragraphs of 1 sections 2 and 3 recall also the notation n ibqn icqn which was introduced in 1 definition 4 2 6 daniel r grayson lemma 1 8 let n be an exact category then k 0 n 0 k 0 n and k 0 0 n k 1 n proof observe that k 0 n 0 k 0 qc 2 n qcn coker k 0 qc 2 n k 0 qcn k 0 qcn k 0 n an object 0 n u b 0 n is essentially the same thing as an object n bqn because the unique arrow u 0 n is a quasi isomorphism if and only if n bqn similarly for an object of c 0 n observe then that k 0 0 n k 0 ib qn icqn k 0 n k 1 n the final isomorphism of the chain is provided by 1 corollary 7 2 for our current purpose we may adopt either k 0 0 n or k 0 n as the definition of k 1 n and we identify a class 0 n 0 k 0 0 n with the corresponding class n k 1 n corollary 1 9 given an exact functor f m n between exact categories that support long exact sequences there is an exact sequence k 1 m k 1 n k 0 f k 0 m k 0 n remark 1 10 an explicit computation shows that in general k 0 f is not isomorphic to coker k 1 m k 1 n ker k 0 m k 0 n it compares the exact sequence above to quillen s localization sequence for the embedding of a dedekind domain with nontrivial ideal class group into its field of fractions 2 the long exact sequence to extend the long exact sequence of 1 9 to the left we introduce the notion of split cubes of exact categories definition 2 1 a pair f in a category c is split if there is a map g called the splitting with g f 1 a split 0 cube of c is an object of c for n n a split n 1 cube is a split pair c c in the category of split n cubes of c a split n cube of exact categories is a split n cube in the category of exact categories recall from 1 section 7 first paragraph that the functor n 7 n can be iterated n times yielding a functor n n 7 nn where nn is regarded here as a split n cube of exact categories it is split because the functor is split by the functor since the functor is natural the functor can be viewed as a split pair of functors from exact categories to exact categories and thus n can be viewed as a split n cube of such functors in particular if m n is a pair of exact categories then n m f n nm f nn is a split n cube of pairs of exact relative algebraic k theory by elementary means 7 categories that is a stronger condition than being a pair of split n cubes since the splittings are not part of the data incorporated into a cube observe that if g c ab is a functor from a category c to the category ab of abelian groups then we can extend it to a functor on split n cubes in c by induction on n by defining g c c coker gc gc since a direct summand of an exact sequence is exact an exact sequence g g g of functors c ab remains exact when extended to a sequence of functors on split n cubes of c if c is a split n cube of exact categories and m n then the discussion above gives a meaning to kmc as does the notion of multi relative k theory of a cube of exact categories discussed in 1 appendix the two meanings agree because the long exact sequence of relative k theory for a split pair f m n splits into a collection of split short exact sequences 0 kmm kmn km f 0 demonstrating that the relative k group km f is isomorphic to coker kmm kmn since the meanings agree we may allow the ambiguity in notation as in the statement of the following lemma for those readers interested only in the elementary content of this paper the second meaning can be ignored lemma 2 2 given an exact category n with m n and n n there is a natural isomorphism km nn km nn proof we apply 1 corollary 7 1 and use the notation used there km nn mk nn mv 0 nkn m nkn km nn here k nn is the multi relative k theory spectrum of the split n cube nn of exact categories and v 0 denotes the functor that gives the 0 th stage of the postnikov filtration of a spec trum readers interested only in the elementary content of this paper may takeknn k 0 nn as a definition in that case the proof of the lemma would amount to the following chain of isomorphisms km nn k 0 m nn k 0 m nn k 0 m nn km nn corollary 2 3 given an exact functor f m n between exact categories that support long exact sequences and n n there is a long exact sequence kn 1 m kn 1 n k 0 n m f n edbc gf a knm knn edbc gf a k 0 m k 0 n here k 0 denotes the functor on pairs of exact categories discussed above ex tended to split n cubes of such pairs 8 daniel r grayson remark 2 4 settling the conjecture 1 6 would imply that k 0 n f kn 1 f for n n the corollary doesn t address generators and relations for k 0 f but good ones are already provided by the isomorphism k 0 f coker k 0 f k 0 m k 0 n proof we interpret the groups in the statement of 1 9 as functors from the cat egory of pairs f of exact categories to the category of abelian groups so we can extend them to functors on split n cubes of pairs of exact categories the se quence remains exact when applied to n m f n yielding the following exact sequence k 1 nm k 1 nn k 0 n m f n k 0 nm k 0 nn by 2 2 we can rewrite it as follows kn 1 m kn 1 n k 0 n m f n knm knn splicing these 5 term exact sequences together yields the desired result 3 proof of exactness part 0 lemma 3 1 letm be an exact category and let 1 m m m be the identity functor then k 0 1 m 0 proof consider a generator m n u of k 0 1 m with m n u b 1 m the map u 1 m n u n n 1 is in p so n n 1 the successive subquotients ni i ni i 1 of the degree wise filtration of n n 1 are in b 1 m because an identity map is a quasi isomorphism so we can write i ni i ni i 1 the object ni i ni i 1 is concentrated in degree i so its differentials vanish rendering its top and bottom differentials equal and thus it is in the image of hence each term in the sum vanishes corollary 3 2 the sequence of groups in 1 7 is a chain complex proof examine the following commutative diagram in which the lemma has been applied at three spots k 0 0 m 1 f 0 1 k 0 0 n 1 0 0 1 k 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 k 0 m 1 m 1 f k 0 m f n 1 0 f 1 k 0 m 0 f 1 0 k 0 n 1 n 1 0 k 0 n 0 relative algebraic k theory by elementary means 9 4 facts about the grothendieck group part 1 lemma 4 1 letm be an exact category and consider objectsm m m their classes m and m in k 0 m are equal if and only if there exist objects v 0 v 1 v 2 of m and exact sequences of the form e 0 m v 0 v 1 v 2 0 and e 0 m v 0 v 1 v 2 0 we assume no relationship between the maps of e and the maps of e remark 4 2 clayton sherman has notified me that this lemma occurs in a 1974 preprint of steven gersten entitled higher k theory i products where it is attributed to richard swan proof use the notationm m to indicate the condition that the three objects and two short exact sequences exist if m m then m m follows from additivity and the existence of e and e we introduce some terminology a commutative additive monoid is cancella tive if in it x z y z x y holds an additive equivalence relation is called cancellative if the corresponding quotient commutative monoid is the relation is a cancellative additive equivalence relation on the commutative monoid consisting of the isomorphism classes of m where direct sum gives the addition operation for example additivity follows by forming direct sums of the exact sequences involved to show m m reflexivity one takes e and e to be 0 m 1 m 0 0 compatibility with isomorphism is similar symmetry follows from interchanging e and e to show m w m w m m cancellation one replaces v 0 by v 0 w to show m m m m m transitivity one uses additivity to deduce that m m m m and then cancels m now let h denote the commutative monoid of equivalence classes of objects of m modulo with the equivalence class of m denoted by m since it is cancellative the universal map from h to a group g is injective to see that construct g in the standard way as a quotient set of h h where h h k k if and only if h k h k we may thus identify h with the equivalence class of h 0 there is a well defined homomorphism g k 0 m defined by m m 7 m m there is also a well defined homomorphism k 0 m g defined on generators by m 7 m because the relation is additive over short exact sequences to see that consider an exact sequence 0 m i m p m 0 and use the following 10 daniel r grayson pair of exact sequences to show m m m 0 m 10 m m 0 1 m 0 0 m m i 00 1 m m p 0 m 0 the two homomorphisms are inverse to each other as can be verified on generators so they are isomorphisms hence m m if and only if m m yielding the result desired corollary 4 3 the classes m and m in k 0 m are equal if and only if there exist three objects v 0 v 1 v 2 of m and two exact sequences of the form e 0 m v 0 v 1 v 2 0 and e 0 m v 0 v 1 v 2 0 proof the leftward implication follows from additivity in k 0 applied to e and e to prove the rightward implication suppose m m adding length 1 acyclic complexes formed from the maps 1 m and 1 m to the short exact sequences provided by the lemma yields the following exact sequences of the form desired 0 m m m v 0 v 1 v 2 0 0 m m m v 0 v 1 v 2 0 5 proof of exactness part 1 lemma 5 1 the subsequence k 0 m f n k 0 m 0 f k 0 n 0 of the sequence in theorem 1 7 is exact proof by corollary 3 2 we know the sequence is a complex the identifications in lemma 1 8 allow us to write the sequence in the form k 0 f k 0 m f k 0 n so we consider an arbitrary element m m ofk 0 m killed by f and try to show it is in the image of the previous map which we ll call projection by 4 3 applied to fm and fm we find exact sequences 0 fm u n 0 d n 1 d n 2 0 and 0 fm u n 0 d n 1 d n 2 0 in n let n denote the binary complex n d d and regard u and u as quasi isomorphisms u fm n and u fm n here we write the same name for an object and the corresponding chain complex concentrated in degree 0 the class in k 0 f of the object m m n u u b f projects to m m in k 0 m yielding the result relative algebraic k theory by elementary means 11 6 proof of exactness part 2 let m f n be an exact functor between exact categories for i n and m n u b f let m n u i m i n i u i where the shift operation on chain complexes or on binary chain complexes is the standard one as defined in 1 definition 2 1 lemma 6 1 for i n and m n u b f the equation m n u i 1 i m n u holds in k 0 f proof we may assume i 1 the naive filtration of m and n does not necessarily induce a filtration of u in b f because the components uj may not be isomorphisms nevertheless it does induce a filtration of the mapping cone c of the identity map 1 m n u because identity maps have acyclic mapping cones and any map between such cones is a quasi isomorphism moreover the successive subquotients of the filtration are diagonal hence c 0 additivity over the cone exact sequence 0 m n u c m n u 1 0 gives the result corollary 6 2 any element of k 0 f can be written in the form m n u for some object m n u of b f proof using direct sum an arbitrary element can be written as a difference m n u m n u of generators which can be rewritten as m m 1 n n 1 u u 1 lemma 6 3 the subsequence k 0 0 n k 0 m f n k 0 m 0 of the sequence in theorem 1 7 is exact proof by corollary 3 2 we know the sequence is a complex using the corol lary consider an arbitrary element of the form m n u in k 0 m f n that projects to 0 where m n u b f and try to show it is in the image of the previous map identifying k 0 m 0 with k 0 m by lemma 1 8 we see that m m k 0 m where c i 1 i ci for a chain complex c us ing that equality we refer to the elementary proof of 1 lemma 5 4 which shows something slightly stronger than is written in the statement of the lemma that there exists a pairx c 2 m of acyclic chain complexes such that gr m gr x gr m gr x acyclicity of x tells us that x 0 0 is in b f and that the map 0 x 0 0 is in p hence that x 0 0 0 in k 0 f we replace m n u by m n u x 0 0 without changing its class in k 0 f arriving at a situation where gr m gr m replacing the objects of m by the objects of m and composing the differentials of m with the appropriate isomorphisms we achieve gr m gr m without changing the isomorphism class of m hence m l for some l bm the quasi isomorphism u fl n has an acyclic mapping cone cone u c 2 n since gr cone u gr n gr fl 1 gr cone u there is a unique object cone u bqn with cone u cone u thus we 12 daniel r grayson get a class 0 cone u 0 k 0 0 n the first group of our sequence and the goal is to show it maps to our generator the remark in the previous paragraph about mapping cones applies more gen erally given x y b f and a map f x y in c f 2 the mapping cone cone f is uniquely of the form cone f for some cone f b f let c f be defined just as c f was except that the comparison maps inside each object are not required to be quasi isomorphisms now consider the following exact sequences of pairs in c f 2 where each pair is displayed as a vertical arrow 0 0 m fl 1 1 u 1 m fl 1 0 0 m n u 1 m n u 0 0 0 0 fl 0 u m fl 1 1 u m 0 0 1 0 0 0 n 0 m n u m 0 0 0 applying cone to each of the pairs above yields the following pair of exact sequences in c f 2 0 m n u y w 0 0 0 cone u 0 y z 0 the comparison maps in each of the objects here are quasi isomorphisms because in every case either we have the mapping cone of a quasi isomorphism in 4 of the 6 cases or we have the mapping cone of a map between two objects each with a comparison map that is a quasi isomorphism in 4 of the 6 cases thus the exact sequences lie in c f 2 we see that our exact sequences arise from exact sequences in b f in which y cone 1 u 0 m n u y w m fl 1 1 0 0 0 cone u 0 y z cone 1 m 0 0 0 the naive filtration of l and m induces filtrations of w and z with diagonal successive subuotients so w and z vanish in k 0 f from additivity and the two exact sequences we deduce that m n u y 0 cone u 0 yielding the result relative algebraic k theory by elementary means 13 7 facts about the grothendieck group part 2 lemma 7 1 let vd wm be an exact functor between exact categories with weak equivalences in the sense of 1 definition a 1 and with a cylinder functor in the sense of 2 1 6 assume that the cone of any isomorphism in m has an admissible filtration whose successive subquotients are in the image of up to isomorphism consider objects m m m their classes m and m in the relative grothendieck group k 0 of the pair are equal if and only if there exist objects v 0 v 1 v 2 ofm mapping cones c and c of maps in w objects d and d in the image of and exact sequences of the form e 0 m c d v 0 v 1 v 2 0 and e 0 m c d v 0 v 1 v 2 0 remark 7 2 a cylinder functor supports also the construction of cones and suspensions if wm is the category of chain complexes over an exact category then the mapping cylinder for chain complexes provides a cylinder functor and if w contains the quasi isomorphisms then the cylinder axiom holds the cone is defined as the cokernel of the front inclusion into the cylinder and agrees with the mapping cone and the suspension of m is defined as the cone of m 0 and agrees with the functor m 7 m 1 the assumption about filtrations of mapping cones in the lemma is a substitute in our context for the cylinder axiom remark 7 3 the grothendieck group k 0 is the quotient of k 0 m by the sub group h generated by all elements of the form f d for some d d together with all elements of the form m m for some m m in w it is indepen dent of v for the elementary purposes of this paper that may be taken as the definition proof given f m m inm consider the following pair of exact sequences 0 m cone f m 1 0 0 m cone 1 m m 1 0 by the hypothesis on filtrations we know cone 1 m vanishes in k 0 so by additivity cone f m m in particular cones of maps in w vanish in k 0 establishing the leftward implication write k 0 as the quotient k 0 m h where h is the subgroup described by 7 3 and use the notation m 0 temporarily to denote the class of m in k 0 m thereby distinguishing it from m k 0 a further consequence of the hypothesis on filtrations and the argument above is that we may regard h as being generated by all elements of the form f d 0 for some d d together with all elements of the form cone f 0 for some f w to prove the rightward implication consider objects m m m and suppose m m it follows that m 0 m 0 h and can be written as a linear 14 daniel r grayson combination of generators using direct sums to combine like terms with coeffi cients of the same sign in the linear combination we may write m 0 m 0 d 0 d c 0 c 0 for some objects d and d in the image of and for some mapping cones c and c of maps in w thus m c d 0 m c d 0 and an application of 4 1 gives the result 8 facts about k 1 for forming the total complex of a complex n of complexes or for forming the total binary complex of a binary complex of complexes and so on we will fix the following convention for adjusting the signs of the differentials to produce the differential of the total complex we alter the sign of the differential of the complex ni by 1 i that is equivalent to rewriting the chain complex ni d ni 1 where each d is a chain map of degree 0 as a chain complex ni i d ni 1 i 1 where each d is a chain map of degree 1 obeying the usual sign rule observe that any chain complex m d is isomorphic to m d and isomorphic objects have the same class in grothendieck groups so the change of sign causes no problem in practice lemma 8 1 given n bqn the equation n i 1 i n holds in k 1 n proof apply 6 1 to the exact functor 0 n an acyclic binary chain complex n 1 n 0 of length 1 is essentially the same thing as an automorphism n 0 n 0 we formalize that as follows definition 8 2 if is an automorphism of an object n of an exact category n let a k 1 n where a is the acyclic binary complex of n with copies of n in degrees 0 and 1 with top differential n n and with bottom differential 1 n n any acyclic binary chain complex of n of the form n 1 f g n 0 is isomorphic to a f g 1 definition 8 3 an automorphism of an object n of an exact category n is called elementary if it has the form 1 0 1 with respect to some direct sum decomposition n n n of n lemma 8 4 let n be an exact category and let n be an object of n 1 if and are automorphisms of n then k 1 n 2 if is a product of elementary automorphisms then 0 relative algebraic k theory by elementary means 15 proof for 1 consider the following pair of bicomplexes in n with the same underlying z 2 graded object concentrated in degrees 0 1 0 1 n 1 n n n n 1 1 n 1 n 1 n the diagrams above anticommute as they ought to in a bicomplex the total complexes give a single object k of bqn filter by rows one of which is diagonal to see that k k 1 n filter by columns and apply 8 1 to see that k yielding the result for 2 by 1 we may assume is elementary with respect to a direct sum decomposition n n n of n additivity over the short exact sequence 0 a 1 n a a 1 n 0 gives the result lemma 8 5 suppose m and n are objects of bqn and f m n and g m n are isomorphisms of complexes then the following equation holds in k 1 n n m i 1 i fig 1 i proof form two complexes of complexes of n with the same underlying z 2 graded object that have m in column 1 and n in column 0 using f and the top differentials ofm and n in the first and using g and the bottom differentials in the second all rows and columns are acyclic so the total complexes form an object k of bqn filter by columns and apply 8 1 to see that k n m filter by rows to get acyclic binary complexes of length 1 of the form mi fi gi ni supported in degrees i i 1 which are in turn isomorphic to acyclic binary complexes of the form a fig 1 i i lemma 8 6 suppose that d 1 dn are acyclic differentials on a graded object n of n and let be a permutation of the set 1 n then the following equation holds in k 1 n n d 1 d 1 n d 2 d 2 n dn d n 0 proof a permutation can be written as a product of disjoint cycles so by treating each cycle separately we may assume is a cycle of order n by renumbering we may assume 1 2 2 3 n 1 16 daniel r grayson the signed block permutation matrix s 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 gives an automorphism of nn that is a product of elementary matrices for example when n 2 one uses the following equation 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 the general case follows from the case for n 2 by writing s as a product of signed transpositions moreover s satisfies the equation s d 1 dn 0 d 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 dn d 1 0 0 0 d 2 dn d 1 s and thus gives an isomorphism s n d 1 dn n d 2 dn d 1 in cqn now apply 8 5 to the objects nn d 1 dn d 1 dn and nn d 1 dn d 2 dn d 1 along with 8 4 to get n d 1 d 2 n d 2 d 3 n dn 1 dn n dn d 1 n n d 1 dn d 2 dn d 1 nn d 1 dn d 1 dn 0 corollary 8 7 if n bqn then n n in k 1 n proof this follows from the case n 2 of the lemma 9 proof of exactness part 3 letm f n be an exact functor between exact categories lemma 9 1 given e bc f such that tote b f is acyclic the classes totesrc k 1 m and totetar k 1 n are related by the equation f totesrc totetar proof by the exact sequence of a mapping cone it suffices to show that cone totecomp totfesrc totetar k 1 n vanishes observe that for each i z the map eicomp fe i src e i tar is a quasi isomorphism in cn and hence its mapping cone is acyclic thus the successive subquotients of the naive filtration of e in the b direction are in bqn moreover they are diagonal because the two differentials in the b direction no longer contribute and there was only one differential in the c direction hence their classes vanish in k 1 n and thus so does their sum as desired lemma 9 2 the subsequence k 0 0 m f k 0 0 n k 0 m f n of the sequence in theorem 1 7 is exact relative algebraic k theory by elementary means 17 proof by corollary 3 2 we know the sequence is a complex consider an arbitrary element n n of k 0 0 n that dies in k 0 m f n by 7 1 we can find a pair of exact sequences q 0 n c d v 0 v 1 v 2 0 q 0 n c d v 0 v 1 v 2 0 in b f in which c and c are mapping cones of maps in p and d and d are diagonal since n n c and c are acyclic the subcomplexes l d v 0 p e v 1 e v 2 l d v 0 p e v 1 e v 2 have acyclic total complexes in b f applying the functors and yields the complexes l l l and l of objects in c f up to a permutation of direct summands the objects of c f involved in the two complexes l l and l l are equal to achieve equality we implement the permutation of direct summands explicitly to get the following pair of complexes a anda connecting the same objects in c f each with acyclic total complexes and with isomorphisms a l l and a l l where the isomorphisms are implemented as permutations of direct summands possibly with signs a d d v 0 v 0 q v 1 v 1 r v 2 v 2 a d d v 0 v 0 q v 1 v 1 r v 2 v 2 the diagram above does not commute the matrices of the four maps are given by the following equations q p 0 e 0 0 p 0 e r e 0 0 e q 0 p e 0 p 0 0 e r e 0 0 e we have inserted an unmotivated minus sign so the computation below comes out right compensating for it with a minus sign in let e be the object of bc f provided by the pair a a its total complex is an acyclic object of b f applying lemma 9 1 to e we see that it suffices to show that n n totetar in k 1 n the exact sequences 0 totl totq n c 0 0 totl totq n c 0 18 daniel r grayson allow us to deduce that n n totltar totl tar c tar ctar in k 1 n since ctar and c tar are mapping cones of isomorphisms of binary complexes the naive filtration of those binary complexes induces a filtration on them whose successive quotients are diagonal and acyclic showing that c tar ctar 0 hence it is enough to show that totltar totl tar totetar in k 1 n notice the difference between two meanings of tot here totltar and totl tar are total binary complexes of complexes of binary complexes whereas totetar is the total binary complex of a binary complex of complexes we implement the direct sum l l up to a permutation b l l of summands by defining b cb f to be the following chain complex of objects of b f d d v 0 v 0 p 0 e 0 0 p 0 e v 1 v 1 e 0 0 e v 2 v 2 applying the functors and yields the following chain complexes displayed here as a and a were displayed above b d d v 0 v 0 q v 1 v 1 r v 2 v 2 b d d v 0 v 0 q v 1 v 1 r v 2 v 2 here q and r are as in a above so b a e but q and r differ from q and r as follows q p 0 e 0 0 p 0 e r e 0 0 e it suffices to show that totetar totbtar we know that totbtar totetar so we introduce a permutation isomorphism g e b defined as follows intending to apply 8 5 g 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0

following diagram commutes e g d d v 0 v 0 q g 0 v 1 v 1 r g 1 v 2 v 2 g 2 b d d v 0 v 0 q v 1 v 1 r v 2 v 2 commutativity of the left hand square amounts to the following computation g 1 q 0 1 1 0 0

g induces an isomorphism tot gtar tot etar tot btar that serves as a companion for the identity tot etar tot btar since it is a product of elementary matrices in each degree 8 4 and 8 5 yield the desired equality totetar totbtar 10 proof of exactness conclusion proof of 1 7 apply 5 1 6 3 and 9 2 references 1 daniel r grayson algebraic k theory via binary complexes j amer math soc 25 2012 no 4
