often have specific expectations limiting the possible inferences that can be drawn from the experiment nonetheless as hacking has said experiments have lives of their own those lives do not end with the initial report of the results and consequences of the experiment going back and re thinking the consequences of the experiment in a new context theoretical or empirical has great merit as a strategy for investigation and for scientific problem analysis i apply this analysis to the interplay between fizeau s classic optical experiments and the building of special relativity einstein s understanding of the problems facing classical electrodynamics and optics in part was informed by fizeau s 1851 experiments however between 1851 and 1905 fizeau s experiments were duplicated and reinterpreted by a succession of scientists including hertz lorentz and michelson einstein s analysis of the consequences of the experiments is tied closely to this theoretical and experimental tradition however einstein s own inferences from the experiments necessarily differ greatly from the inferences drawn by others in that tradition 1 experiment theory and matter ether interaction a

experiments 2 experiments have lives of their own in hacking s well known formulation those lives do not end with the experiments themselves but include how researchers take up the results of the experiments in formulating and pursuing theories problems and research programs franklin 1986 and 1993 and hacking 1983 among others emphasize the role of experiment in the building and pursuit of scientific theories following peirce s and laudan s earlier analyses i focus on how successive reconsideration of key experiments within a given research tradition can reveal substantive information about the problems scientists see themselves as needing to solve and about the structure of possible new theories and research programs i investigate the relationship between the experimental and theoretical tradition in electrodynamics and optics in the 19 th century and einstein s abandonment of the luminiferous ether as superfluous in his 1905 paper on special relativity einstein s strategy here was partly a very clever avoidance of blind alleys into which 19 th century researchers had been led in particular the blind alley of including matter ether interaction as a variable in electrodynamics and optics i will trace a tradition of inferences about matter ether interaction drawn from the fizeau experiments a tradition of which einstein was aware einstein s knowledge of this tradition informed his decision to build a theory with certain distinctive features einstein s removal of the ether required him to depart from the series of previous conclusions drawn from the fizeau experiments in particular conclusions which blocked the principle of relativity i conclude that the role of re examining experiments sometimes is to show that a given problem like the problem of matter ether interaction has hitherto unknown facets or even solutions this fact can be of considerable interest independently of the other material conclusions that can be drawn from the experiment 3 1 experiment theory and matter ether interaction the influence of experiment and of 19 th century ether theories on the building of special relativity is difficult to assess einstein gives few citations in his 1905 paper on electrodynamics and few letters notes drafts or journal entries from the period survive i in his sixties einstein writes that during his student years he read works by hertz maxwell kirchoff and helmholtz einstein 1979 1946 15 einstein presents his argument against the luminiferous ether in 1905 as partly inspired by mach s humean arguments that the ether and atoms should be treated as speculative and not as well founded empirically in the same reminiscences though einstein argues that exterior criteria testing the fit between theory and observed phenomena are crucial and primary einstein 1979 1946 20 ff holton 1969 cites a first hand report by shankland according to which einstein said he could not remember whether he was aware of albert michelson s ether drift experiments when he composed his 1905 electrodynamics paper p 154 in that paper einstein does mention unsuccessful attempts to discover any motion of the earth relatively to the light medium but these could have been bradley s and airy s stellar aberration experiments einstein 1952 1905 37 shankland reports from those conversations that einstein said he was aware of the stellar aberration experiments and of hippolyte fizeau s experiments from the 1850 s testing the effect of traveling through refractive media such as water on the velocity of light and that these two sets of experiments were enough ii but to say that einstein was aware of fizeau s experiments and stellar aberration is not to say that these were an experimentum crucis that decided the question in favor of special relativity or to say that the experiments pointed unambiguously and immediately to the theory of special relativity iii to say so is to skip two significant steps first as emphasized recently by 4 stachel 2005 19 th century scientists did not see the fizeau experiments as a crucial test ruling out ether theories fizeau himself intended the experiments to help determine the correct approach to a theory of matter ether interaction and the approaches he considered are incompatible with the principle of relativity only in 1895 did hendrik lorentz show that the fizeau experiments could be reinterpreted without matter ether interaction and even lorentz retains the immobile ether as a reference frame the second step then is einstein s reinterpretation of the fizeau experiments in the light of lorentz s and hertz s subsequent theories in 6 of the 1905 paper and in his later lecture on the ether and relativity einstein 2007 1920 einstein works from a very different interpretation of the fizeau experiments from fizeau s own this distinct analysis points the way for einstein to narrow down possible strategies for building his theory of electrodynamics and of optics in doing so he considers carefully the way that lorentz s and hertz s theories incorporate the ether into their explanations i will consider these two steps in turn a stellar aberration and fizeau s experiments experiments on the angle of aberration of light from a star reaching a telescope on the moving earth were a prominent stimulus for fizeau s experiments iv an early such experiment was performed in 1727 by james bradley norton points out that bradley s stellar aberration results were explicable either on the theory that light is emitted as a stream of particles from the star the emission theory or that light is a wave propagating in the luminiferous ether the wave theory norton forthcoming 4 5 it was worth an experimenter s while to attempt to find a way to decide between the emission and wave theories in 1871 george b airy repeated the experiment with a different experimental design airy filled the telescope with water and then 5 compared the results of the water filled telescope with those of the ordinary telescope holton 1969 sums up the results on the model of light as wave propagation through an ether the aberration angle was expected to be larger when the observing telescope was filled with water but on experiment the angle was found to be the same augustin fresnel therefore proposed that the ether is partly carried or dragged along in the motion of a medium such as water having a refractive index larger than 1 p 136 the equation measuring the influence of the medium on the velocity of light became known as the fresnel drag coefficient v fresnel s drag coefficient could not be a direct measure of ether drag since that is an unobservable the drag coefficient measures only the velocity of light proportional to the index of refraction of the medium in which the light is moving any good ether theory needed then to be able to relate the velocity of light relative to the index of refraction of the medium through which the light travels to a theoretical explanation in terms of ether drag as fizeau sums it up in an 1851 paper reporting his experimental results several theories have been proposed to account for the phenomena of light aberration in the wave system first fresnel and more recently monsieurs doppler stokes challis and several others have published important works on the subject but it does not appear that any of the proposed theories has received the complete assent of physicists in the absence of secure notions of the properties of the luminiferous ether and of its relations with ponderable matter one has had to make hypotheses fizeau 1851 385 fizeau s self reported intention in constructing his experiment was thus to choose an appropriate theory to explain light aberration the drag coefficient was well supported already by arago s and fresnel s results but the drag coefficient itself does not explain light aberration nor did it lend itself easily to constructing a theory fizeau shrewdly identifies the problem there was no good theory of the interaction between the light ether and matter without such a theory explanations of light aberration in terms of ether drag beg the crucial question how does the ether participate in the behaviour of light with respect to the medium through which it travels 6 as fizeau sees it then a suitable theory of matter ether interaction had not been found and fizeau s intention is for his experiment to help to decide among various hypotheses that could explain this interaction as fizeau conceives of them these hypotheses are either the ether is adherent and as if fixed to the molecules of the body and consequently shares the movements that can be attributed to this body or in fact the ether is free and independent and is not dragged by the body in its movements or finally by a third hypothesis which shares elements of the other two only part of the ether would be free and the other part would be fixed to the molecules of the body and it alone would participate in the movements of that body fizeau 1851 349 350 the third hypothesis is fresnel s fizeau then analyzes each hypothesis and observes that for each of these hypotheses the influence of motion on the speed of light will be different if the ether is entrained with the body in its motion the speed of light will be increased by the entire speed of the body the ray being supposed to be directed towards the motion if the ether is supposed free the speed of light will not be altered at all if only a part of the ether is entrained the speed of light will be increased when the ray is traveling with the current but by only a fraction of the speed of the body and not by the totality of it as with the first hypothesis this consequence is not as evident as the two preceding ones but fresnel has shown that it can be supported by very probable mechanical considerations fizeau 1851 386 387 the experiment fizeau devises to attempt to decide between the hypotheses is deceptively simple the mode of observation consists in producing interference fringes with two rays of light after passing through two parallel tubes in which air or water flow with a great speed and in opposite directions fizeau 1851 387 388 after the light rays go through the tubes of water or air they interfere a little in a window that they pass through and it is there that one observes the fringes by means of an eyepiece with divisions ibid 389 7 mascart 1893 101 provides this schematic diagram of fizeau s experiment vi the observer is at the far right l and l are converging lenses and m on the far left is a mirror e is a screen and o 1 and o 2 are slits in the screen g is the window or sheet of glass on which the fringes are observed fringes are the visible sign of the location of the light rays at a certain time s and s are the locations of the fringes a 1 and a 2 are tubes of water five millimeters in diameter and nine millimeters apart the water in a 1 flows in the opposite direction from the water in a 2 two rays of sunlight are sent through both tubes in succession beginning at the same time each is sent through one tube converging onto the mirror reflecting back through the other tube and then converging again to produce a fringe on the window one ray travels with the current and another against the current if the light travels at the same speed no matter in which direction the medium is moving then the fringes should coincide perfectly in the window given that they take a path of the same length through the same medium if they do not coincide perfectly then displacement of the fringes will be observed that is an area in which one fringe is seen before the other fringe because the light is moving faster or slower this appears to the observer as the fringes moving to the left or to the right for a few instants fizeau reports the following results t he motion of the air does not produce any sensible displacement of the fringes for water there was an evident displacement the fringes moved to the right when the water moves away from the observer in the tube to his right and towards the observer in the tube to his left the fringes moved to the left when the direction of current in each tube was in the opposite direction fizeau 1851 390 391 original emphasis 8 from a backward looking relativistic perspective this way of putting the observations is suggestive the displacement of the fringes is symmetrical for both cases in whichever direction the water is moving with respect to the observer from this perspective there is nothing in the observations to distinguish the two cases from each other except relative motion the case is very different when we turn to fizeau s conclusions from the experiment about which theoretical hypothesis to adopt fizeau argues that the displacement observed is consistent with the hypothesis that the ether is partly dragged with the current but adopting the hypothesis of partial or full ether drag requires that the ether s motion depends on the motion of the material body that drags it the water in this case that requires some way to distinguish whether the ether is moving with respect to the water or the water with respect to the ether that is it requires distinguishing inertial frames from each other fizeau adopts the hypothesis of partial ether drag with evident reluctance he argues that the fact that any displacement is observed at all rules out the second hypothesis of free ether ibid 393 as fizeau reasons above if the ether is free the velocity of light will not be altered at all by the medium fizeau argues that the actual displacement values are not great enough to confirm the first hypothesis of the fully dragged ether ibid 395 fizeau is forced to concede that the third hypothesis that which is due to fresnel leads to a value of displacement very little different from the result of the observation ibid 396 fizeau concludes that fresnel s hypothesis of partial ether drag appears to give a theoretical explanation for the experiments fizeau has scruples about this result however as stachel observes fizeau concludes his paper with the remark that while fresnel s drag coefficient is well supported by his experiments fresnel s conception of partial ether drag would appear so extraordinary and in several respects so difficult to accept that one would require still more proofs and a deepened examination by mathematical physicists g om tres before accepting 9 it as the expression of the way things really are fizeau 1851 404 translation from stachel 2005 6 b lorentz s reconsideration of fizeau s experiments as stachel 2005 traces in detail fizeau s experiment was not accepted at the time as a rigorous test of theories of ether drag the responses to fizeau s experiment in the succeeding years by mascart poincar and veltmann for instance recognize fizeau s result as a significant empirical advance but not as giving a clear signpost on the path to an adequate theoretical explanation pp 6 7 fizeau frames his experiment in 1851 as a test of the explanatory hypotheses about the interaction between matter and ether is the ether free of interaction with matter in motion is it partially dragged by matter in motion or is it fully dragged but fizeau never considers the hypothesis that the entire effect could be explained without appealing to matter ether interaction at all a signal advance on this score was made in 1895 by hendrik lorentz in his well known attempt at a theory of electrical and optical phenomena in moving bodies or as it is usually called the versuch lorentz shows that fresnel s drag coefficient can be interpreted as exclusively a refraction coefficient lorentz 1895 82 ff lorentz proves that the effect observed by fizeau can be explained and predicted by the reflection and refraction of light waves by the medium through which they pass vii in fact then the first reconsideration of the experiment in this narrative takes place in the versuch fizeau s intention with his original experiment was to test three hypotheses about matter ether interaction but fizeau s write up of his experiment does not consider an alternative hypothesis that there is no matter ether interaction involved rather some other cause is responsible for the observed effect lorentz considers this hypothesis and concludes that it is 10 correct the reflection and refraction of light waves not matter ether interaction is responsible for the effects fizeau observed in his optical and electrodynamical theories lorentz does not abandon the ether he retains the still ether as a reference frame in his 1895 lorentz distinguishes between motion of a light ray with respect to matter and with respect to the ether for instance p 97 however as einstein puts it in his kyoto lecture einstein 2007 1920 as to the mechanical nature of the lorentzian ether it may be said of it in a somewhat playful spirit that immobility is the only mechanical property of which it has not been deprived by h a lorentz p 615 einstein sees lorentz s removal of most mechanical properties from the ether such as fresnel s ether density as a significant step toward the correct account however lorentz s still ether is an absolute reference frame that distinguishes inertial frames from each other as such a picture of electrodynamics and optics that includes the still ether blocks the principle of relativity c hertz s response to the early michelson experiments lorentz s influence on einstein s 1905 paper and on einstein s subsequent elaborations of the theory is well established however einstein s famous assertion in the beginning of the 1905 paper that he will not assign a velocity vector to a point of the empty space in which electromagnetic processes take place has another source the electrodynamic theory of heinrich hertz einstein 1952 1905 38 there is documentary evidence from the period in which einstein was constructing special relativity that einstein was reading hertz s work on electrostatics and electrodynamics in a letter to mileva mari of 1899 einstein writes i ve returned the helmholtz volume and am once again studying hertz s investigations into the propagation of electric force very carefully i am becoming more and more convinced that the electrodynamics of moving bodies as it is currently presented does not correspond to reality and instead can be presented more simply the introduction of the name ether into electrical theories has led to the idea of a medium of whose movement one may be able to 11 speak yet in my opinion without being able to link a physical sense to this expression einstein to mari 1899 cited in einstein 1987 226 after hertz s famous experiments on radio waves in the late 1880 s hertz with many other german scientists leaned toward maxwell s field theory as the simplest and most elegant explanation of the observed phenomena viii however in his 1865 maxwell incorporated states of tension and elasticity of the ether which he saw on analogy with an incompressible fluid into his model of electrodynamic action ix as a report of a lecture by einstein sums up the situation for maxwell himself the ether indeed still had properties which were purely mechanical but neither maxwell nor his followers succeeded in elaborating a mechanical model for the ether which might furnish a satisfactory mechanical interpretation of maxwell s laws of the electromagnetic field the laws were clear and simple the mechanical interpretations clumsy and contradictory einstein 2007 1920 614 in investigations into the propagation of electric force hertz tries to assign a more restricted role to the ether in his own theory than it is given in maxwell s based on the negative results of experiments attempting to establish the motion of the ether relative to matter hertz s electrostatic theory a theory of charges and potentials assigns a single directed magnitude a vector to each point of space to describe the electric and magnetic state of the medium which fills the space at that point hertz 1900 1890 b 241 in the case of actions that take place in the ether and no other medium the ether is assigned a vector nonetheless the significant point is that charges and potentials are taken to depend on conditions of the ether hertz proceeds to identify a difficulty with applying his approach to electrodynamics the description of currents and changing fields whenever in ordinary speech we speak of bodies in motion we have in mind the motion of ponderable matter alone according to our view however the disturbances of the ether which simultaneously arise cannot be without effect and of these we have no knowledge this is equivalent to saying that the question here raised cannot at present be treated at all without introducing arbitrary 12 assumptions as to the motion of the ether furthermore the few existing indications as to the nature of the motion of the ether lead us to suppose that the question above raised whether hertz s approach in electrostatics can be extended to electrodynamics is strictly to be answered in the negative for it appears to follow from such indications as we have that even in the interior of tangible matter the ether moves independently of it indeed this view can scarcely be avoided in view of the fact that we cannot remove the ether from any closed space if now we wish to adapt our theory to this view we have to regard the electromagnetic conditions of the ether and of the tangible matter at every point in space as being in a certain sense independent of each other hertz 1900 1890 b 241 ff hertz s initial preferred approach was to consider the charge of matter in a neighborhood to depend on the electromagnetic conditions of the ether in that neighborhood this allowed him to exclude helmholtz s action at a distance in electrostatics there was no bar to positing this dependence although there was no particular evidence for it either but in electrodynamics there was a barrier the fizeau and michelson experiments x michelson was engaged in duplicating fizeau s experiment when he invented the interferometer in his early experiments in berlin in 1881 michelson and morley re cast the conclusions one can draw from fizeau s experiment when they performed an expanded version of the experiment in 1885 1886 in these experiments michelson and morley famously try to detect ether drift with respect to the earth s motion however the experiments were also intended to repeat the fizeau experiments by investigating more closely with the new more precise interferometer the influence upon the velocity of light of the motion of the medium through which it passes michelson and morley 1886 377 while michelson morley and fizeau agree that the fresnel drag coefficient fits the data fizeau argues that his results support hypothesis of a partially dragged ether michelson and morley argue the experiments support a modified claim the luminiferous ether is entirely unaffected by the motion of the matter which it permeates ibid 386 13 michelson s and morley s reading does not correspond directly to any of fizeau s three hypotheses but is rather a more general conclusion it appears at first glance to correspond to fizeau s second hypothesis of the free ether but michelson and morley argue that another interpretation is possible they report fresnel as arguing that the ether within a moving body is stationary except those parts coalesced around the moving particles of the body which is fizeau s third hypothesis michelson and morley respond that if each particle of a body with its halo of ether is treated as a single body then the hypothesis that the ether is not affected by the motion of the body is confirmed by their more precise results ibid 379 if the ether is not separate from the particles of the body then no variables are needed to describe the effect of the motion of matter on the ether hertz continues his essay on electrodynamics by arguing that responding to experimental data requires removing any independent properties of the ether from electrodynamics since experiments had failed to detect the motion of the ether relative to matter xi but the state of the case is different if we explicitly content ourselves with representing electromagnetic phenomena in a narrower sense up to the extent to which they have hitherto been satisfactorily investigated we may assert that among the phenomena so embraced there is not one which requires the admission of a motion of the ether independently of ponderable matter within this latter this follows at once from the fact that from this class of phenomena no hint has been obtained as to the magnitude of the relative displacement at least this class of electric and magnetic phenomena must be compatible with the view that no such displacement occurs but that the ether which is hypothetically assumed to exist in the interior of ponderable matter only moves with it for the purpose of the present paper we adopt this view hertz 1900 1890 b 242 thus hertz solves the problem posed by experiment for electrodynamic theory by postulating the fully dragged electromagnetic ether which is consistent with michelson s and morley s later reading of the consequences of their experiments 14 2 einstein s 1905 paper as stein 1970 and stachel 2005 show the problem of detecting and describing ether matter interaction was perhaps the most significant problem for ether theories throughout the 19 th century xii in the 1905 paper and in the 1920 address einstein works from a re interpretation of the fizeau experiments and uses this re interpretation to remove barriers to his argument for the principle of relativity fizeau concludes reluctantly that the ether is partially dragged by matter in motion though he concedes that this hypothesis is implausible and tentative hertz infers from the experiments that the ether is not affected by the motion of matter and does not move independently of it nonetheless hertz retains an electrodynamic ether fully dragged by matter even lorentz retains the still ether as a reference frame lorentz 1895 97 einstein argues that a re casting of the experiments justifies the claim that the ether is superfluous einstein 1952 1905 38 and does not take part in the movements of bodies einstein 2007 1920 614 this seemingly minor re casting of the consequences of the experiments has profound significance for the interpretation of special relativity and of its relationship to the preceding experimental and theoretical tradition in the introductory remarks to 6 of the 1905 paper einstein observes the introduction of a luminiferous ether will prove to be superfluous inasmuch as the view here to be developed will not require an absolutely stationary space provided with special properties nor assign a velocity vector to a point of the empty space in which electromagnetic processes take place einstein 1952 1905 38 einstein s remark about absolute stationary space often is taken to be a response to lorentz and certainly it appears to be xiii lorentz focuses on whether it is possible to detect the motion of the ether relative to matter and takes the null result of the ether experiments to confirm his theory of the stationary ether einstein takes this reasoning one step further if the motion of the 15 ether relative to matter can t be detected why include it in the theory as a postulated vector quantity as a set of variables or as a reference frame einstein s first remark was no doubt directed at lorentz but what about the remark about assigning a velocity vector to empty space in the versuch lorentz argues that the divergence assigned to the pure ether is zero lorentz 1895 5 by contrast hertz 1900 1890 b begins with a proposal to assign velocity vectors to apparently empty space which hertz postulates is filled with the ether we therefore assume that at every point a single definite velocity can be assigned to the medium which fills space and we denote the components of this in the directions of x y z by a b g wherever we find tangible matter in space we definitely deduce the values of a b g from the motion of this wherever we do not find in the space any tangible matter we may assign to a b g any arbitrary value which is consistent with the given motions at the boundary of the empty space and and of the same order of magnitude we might for example give a b g those values which would exist in the ether if it moved like any gas hertz 1900 1890 b 243 hertz removes maxwell s variables describing the elasticity and density of the ether from the theory in hertz 1900 1890 b but hertz s 1890 theory requires postulating that the ether behaves like a gas and assigning corresponding velocity vectors to empty space for einstein hertz s theory wins the formal battle with maxwell but loses the interpretive war xiv maxwell appeals to interaction between the ether and material bodies to explain electrodynamic action hertz argues that there is no evidence for action of the electromagnetic ether independent of matter nonetheless for hertz the ether is the carrier of fields as the report of einstein s kyoto lecture has it in hertz s theory matter appears not only as the bearer of velocities kinetic energy and mechanical pressures but also as the bearer of electromagnetic fields since such fields also occur in vacuo i e in the ether the ether also appears as bearer of electromagnetic fields the ether appears indistinguishable in its functions from ordinary matter within matter it takes part in the motion of matter and in empty space it has everywhere a velocity so that the ether has a definitely assigned 16 velocity throughout the whole of space there is no fundamental difference between hertz s ether and ponderable matter which in part subsists in the ether the hertz theory was at variance with the result of fizeau s important experiment on the velocity of the propagation of light in moving fluids and with other established experimental results einstein 2007 1920 615 the final sentence is not quite historically correct as discussed above hertz s theory of the fully dragged ether was at least consistent with michelson s and morley s interpretation of their own results from 1885 and 1886 but hertz s theory is inconsistent with einstein s own interpretation of the fizeau result which is that one is obliged to infer from fizeau s experiment that the luminiferous ether does not take part in the motions of bodies ibid 614 it is not correct that the hertz theory was falsified by experiment but it is correct that hertz s inferences from experiment along with michelson s and morley s own inferences from their experiments were underdetermined by the experimental evidence for einstein there is no evidence that the ether moves at all and so there is no reason to assign it a velocity vector further if hertz s and michelson s postulate of the fully dragged ether were correct and if hertz s velocity vectors were assigned to empty space then that would distinguish inertial frames from each other the ether would have a definitely assigned velocity throughout the whole of space that would mean that the laws of electrodynamics and of optics are not invariant with respect to arbitrary transformations of inertial frames which would undermine the principle of relativity whether einstein formulated the principle of relativity before or after his reconsideration of the consequences of the fizeau experiment is an interesting and perhaps unanswerable question however even once einstein had formulated the principle of relativity two things were necessary for einstein to be able to formulate an argument for the relativity of simultaneity as consistent with experiment 17 1 einstein had to be able to argue against lorentz s still ether which distinguishes inertial frames from each other 2 einstein had to argue that the ether does not take part in the motions of bodies as do hertz s fully dragged ether and fizeau s partially dragged ether if the ether is the carrier of fields and the ether has a definitely assigned velocity throughout the whole of space then here again the principle of relativity arguably would not hold this possibility requires einstein to reinterpret hertz s and fizeau s inferences from the fizeau and michelson experiments in the 1905 paper einstein demonstrates that there is a consistent and simple model of his own theory that eliminates matter ether interaction altogether einstein shows that the single relation necessary to the representation of electrical action is a consistent representation of the force exerted on the charge carriers he proves using the lorentz transform that his model of that force is invariant with respect to arbitrary transformations of inertial frames the path and intensity of the currents in the maxwell hertz equations are represented by vectors these vectors map displacements of points within systems of spatial coordinates the principle of relativity postulates that the laws of electrodynamics and of optics are valid for arbitrary transformations of these systems of coordinates einstein postulates the principle of relativity the light principle and the maxwell hertz equations to capture the relations that hertz and maxwell capture using postulates about the motion and mechanical and dynamical behavior of the ether again then einstein eliminates the relation of interaction between ether and matter altogether einstein s removal of the ether from this theory is backed by a sound but little appreciated re interpretation of the fizeau experiments which differs significantly from the 18 conclusions fizeau michelson morley and hertz draw from the same experiments the following are the conclusions drawn beginning with fizeau s third hypothesis the one he accepts after the experiment only part of the ether would be free and the other part would be fixed to the molecules of the body and it alone would participate in the movements of that body fizeau 1851 350 the luminiferous ether is entirely unaffected by the motion of the matter which it permeates michelson and morley 1886 386 the ether which is hypothetically assumed to exist in the interior of ponderable matter only moves with it hertz 1900 1890 b 242 the introduction of a luminiferous ether will prove to be superfluous einstein 1952 1905 38 the luminiferous ether does not take part in the movements of bodies einstein 2007 1920 614 fizeau michelson and morley lorentz and hertz focus on whether it is possible to detect the motion of the ether relative to matter einstein goes further if the motion of the ether relative to matter cannot be detected then the ether should not be considered to contribute to the motions of bodies or to move independently of or with material bodies it is superfluous to electrodynamics and to optics einstein found a solution to key problems in electrodynamics and optics only when he realized that an account of electromagnetic and optical action need not incorporate any assumptions about the mechanical properties of the ether xv this was the assumption that required hertz and lorentz to include elements in their theories that to einstein were unnecessary lorentz s still ether as absolute reference frame and the vector quantities hertz assigns to empty space 19 3 reconsidering experiments the question of what influence the michelson michelson morley and fizeau experiments had on einstein s 1905 paper depends on the answer to the question how did einstein interpret these experiments einstein would not and indeed could not have used the fizeau experiments to falsify lorentz s and hertz s ether theories the experiments don t falsify those theories instead the brief remarks at the beginning of 6 that einstein will neither appeal to the ether as stationary inertial frame nor assign velocity vectors to empty space indicate that einstein used the lack of evidence for ether matter interaction as delineating the outlines of and substantive constraints on the theory he should build this is a substantive inference from the reconsideration of existing experiments hertz attempted to integrate the experiments on matter ether interaction into his theory but he ended up having to make a substantial idealizing assumption assigning velocity vectors to empty space lorentz posited the seeming opposite that the ether had no object like properties at all but was used as a rest frame of reference einstein s position in 6 of the 1905 paper is that neither of these theoretical strategies is necessary but that is not to say that the problem that these theories were attempting to solve has an easy answer it is to say the opposite that the tradition of trying to use variables describing matter ether interaction to construct explanations in electrodynamics and in optics had reached an impasse a major gain from re examining experiments or from examining them particularly closely in the first place is to find mistaken or too narrow inferences made by previous theories these may indicate blind explanatory alleys or in some cases which can appear miraculous new unconsidered investigative paths the examination of experiment can illuminate existing 20 problems but can also show that problems are lurking in the fit between existing theory and evidence problems that have not yet been appreciated from an historical perspective the more interesting the experiment the more many faceted are its consequences an experiment can provide hints for the structure of a new theory not just evidential support for that theory xvi these hints can function in several ways 1 they can give heuristic guidance as to the possible structure of the final theory 2 they can help the scientist to avoid blind alleys of previous or merely possible theories 3 they can provide the occasion for the scientist to see unexplored theoretical alternatives to ask new questions and to pose new problems even when these alternatives questions and problems may not be related directly to the initial goal of the experiment re evaluating the evidential support for a theory is not the only reason to reconsider experiments a new problem a problem that existing theory does not consider or address might be found in an existing experimental tradition while einstein was particularly gifted at evaluating scientific problems reconsidering experiments and the problems they pose is an activity that might profitably be engaged in by historians and philosophers of science as well 21 references brown harvey 1995 physical relativity space time structure from a dynamical perspective oxford oxford university press darrigol olivier 1999

storing up two kinds of energy namely the actual energy depending on the motions of its parts and potential energy consisting of the work which the medium will do in recovering from displacement in virtue of its elasticity the propagation of undulations consists in the continual transformation of one of these forms of energy into the other alternately maxwell 1865 463 x even if einstein was not aware of the michelson experiments hertz had reason to know about them in intimate detail hermann von helmholtz had been hertz s doctoral supervisor hertz finished his dissertation in 1880 then remained in helmholtz s lab as a post doctoral researcher for several years mulligan 2001 147 n in 1880 michelson traveled to berlin to work with helmholtz michelson invented the interferometer and made his first experiments with it in helmholtz s laboratory in berlin in 1880 1881 while hertz was working in the same laboratory by 1890 hertz had known about michelson s early negative results for almost a decade xi see also a letter of september 3 1889 from hertz to heaviside cited by mulligan 2001 the motion of the ether relative to matter this is indeed a great mystery i thought about it often but did not get an inch in advance i hope for experimental help all that has been done till now has given negative results p 147 xii see also mulligan 2001 xiii see stachel 2002 157 ff and 171 ff for discussion of these points 25 xiv see hon and goldstein 2005 439 and 2005 498 ff for a similar argument regarding einstein s interpretation of an earlier paper of hertz s xv the timeline of einstein s reasoning as reconstructed by stachel 2002 and earman rynasiewicz and glymour 1982 supports this reading xvi i would like to thank an anonymous reviewer for this journal for suggesting this way of putting it
