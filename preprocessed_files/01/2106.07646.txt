have probably heard about voting paradoxes one of the most simple and easy to describe among those paradoxes is the following in certain situations an assembly can very well decide by successive majority votes that a is preferable to b that b is preferable to c but that c is preferable to a no matter what a b and c are this is a cyclic paradoxical set of decisions those a b c might be candidates in some election or options choices to be compared or what else you wish and can figure out for brevity s sake one writes a b c a this paradox has been noticed a long time ago one way to speak about it in french is to say l effet condorcet in most decision procedures this situation is inevitable attempts have been made to find a way out and to avoid it with no avail many details can be found in the book 4 by sen before we go on just a few words about guilbaud s paper 2 con cerning the problem of aggregation of decisions and voting systems on guilbaud s voting systems studying condorcet s paradox guilbaud 2 devised a schema for a whole set of possible voting systems let a be an assembly each subset k of a is called a coalition let the complement kc ark denote the opposing coalition to k a voting system for the assembly a is a set e of coalitions of a to be used as substitutes for ordinary majorities in other words e is a subset of the set s a of all subsets of the set a the elements of e http arxiv org abs 2106 07646 v 1 2 labib haddad are by definition the efficient coalitions there are two requirements put on e c 1 a coalition is efficient if and only if the opposing coalition is not c 2 any coalition that contains an efficient coalition is efficient itself the system a e operates in the following way questions submit ted to the assembly are dichotomous choices which the members of the assembly answer by yes or no thus two coalitions form the pros and the cons the two coalitions are complementary of these two coalitions the efficient one the one which belongs to e outweighs the other the decision is hers of course the majority system is one of guilbaud s voting systems provided a special clause is added to it such as a cast vote in case there is an even number of voters by the way dictatorship is also a guilbaud voting system now to make a long story short there is a problem which stated in terms of pure mathematics is as follows the problem suppose there are three candidates a b c to be compared two by two by successive votes of an assembly a according to a guilbaud voting system a e each member of the assembly having his own preferences to be called his profile one among the six following linear orders 1 a b c 2 a c b 3 c a b 4 c b a 5 b c a 6 b a c those profiles are labeled by the elements 1 2 3 4 5 6 of the cyclic group z 6 z of order 6 the labelling has the following peculiarities rankings p and p 1 always have either a first same candidate or a last same candidate to condorcet paradox 3 go from p to p 1 one disturbs as little as possible these rankings i e one simply swaps the ranks of either the two first or of the two last candidates in a sense rankings p and p 1 are as close as possible to each other finally rankings p and p 3 are opposite for example one has 1 a b c 4 a b c thus in particular the same candidate occupies the second rank in two different rankings p and q if and only if we have p q 3 i e when the two rankings p and q are opposite let k p be the set of the members of the assembly whose profile is p similarly denote k p q the union of coalitions k p and k q and let k p q r be the union of coalitions k p k q and k r problem find conditions on those coalitions such that the final de cision of the assembly be one of the six rankings not a cyclic ranking answer condition c that there exists a profile p such that both coalitions k p p 1 p 2 and k p 1 p 2 p 3 are efficient is necessary and sufficient for the decision of the assembly to be one of the six rankings not cyclic indeed suppose that k p p 1 p 2 and k p 1 p 2 p 3 are both efficient the ranking p has the form x y z there are only two possible cases in the first case one has p x y z p 1 x z y p 2 z x y p 3 z y x the efficient coalition k p p 1 p 2 thus imposes the collective preference x y and efficient coalitionk p 1 p 2 p 3 the collective preference z y whatever the collective preference between x and z the collective ranking will always be linear it will be either p 1 or p 2 in the second case one has p x y z 4 labib haddad p 1 y x z p 2 y z x p 3 z y x here the two efficient coalitionsk p p 1 p 2 andk p 1 p 2 p 3 force respectively collective preferences y z and y x so that the collective ranking is linear this will again be either p 1 or p 2 now conversely suppose the collective ranking of the three candidates is linear even if we have to change the names of the candidates we can assume that this ranking is a b c the coalition of voters for whom a b is efficient this coalition is none other than k 1 2 3 similarly the coalition of voters for whom a c is efficient and that is coalition k 6 1 2 so that condition c is satisfied condition c is both necessary and sufficient of course this applies to the majority system provided a special clause is added to it a quotation here is a long quotation from the paper 1 by elsholtz and list condorcet s paradox shows that pairwise majority voting over three or more candidates can lead to cyclical majority preferences even when the preferences of individual voters are transitive a large literature in social choice theory addresses the threat posed by cycles for the functioning of democratic decision mechanisms several sufficient conditions for the avoidance of cycles have been identified black identified one such condition single peakedness later other sufficient conditions for transitive majority preference were found amongst them single cavedness separability into two groups and latin squarelessness for instance in a famous paper sen generalized these results showing that a con dition that is less demanding than but implied by each of these condi tions is already sufficient for avoiding cycles sen s condition is called triplewise value restriction however sen s condition and theorem are not intuitively straightforward this note aims to make the mechanism underlying sen s result easily accessible by giving an elementary proof of sen s theorem together with a simple reformulation of the condi tion of triplewise value restriction finally we suggest that although there is still some logical space between sen s sufficient condition for condorcet paradox 5 the avoidance of cycles and a necessary and sufficient condition this space may be too narrow to allow an appealing generalization of sen s condition it might be interesting to compare that quotation with the above elaboration we must say that we have already wrote similar comments about the paper by elsholtz and list in 3 references 1 elsholtz
