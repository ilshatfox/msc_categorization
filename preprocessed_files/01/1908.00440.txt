mumbai 400098 abstract the ma nava s ulvasu tra while less sophisticated than the other s ulvasu tras is seen to contain some mathematical ideas and constructions not found in the other s ulvasu tras here we discuss some of these constructions and discuss their significance in the overall context of the s ulvasu tra literature 1 introduction among the works from the vedic period that have come down to us the s ulvasu tras constitute a major source enabling understanding of that time concerning the mathematical aspects s ulvasu tras were composed in aid of the activity around construction of agnis and vedis fireplaces and altars for performance of the yajnas which it is needless to add here had a very important role in the life of the vedic people the vedic community was fairly heterogeneous though with a shared tradition and body of knowledge and there would have been numerous s ulvasu tras used by various local communities not surprisingly very few have survived of the handful of extant s ulvasu tras four are found to be significant from a mathematical point of view baudha yana s ulvasu tra a pastamba s ulvasu tra ma nava s ulvasu tra ka tya yana s ulvasu tra while there is considerable uncertainty about the time when the s ulvasu tras were composed it has now become customary among the commentators to assign to their composition the period 800 200 bce with baudha yana s ulvasu tra believed to be the earliest to be from around 800 500 bce it is also concluded from various considerations that ma nava s ulvasu tra is from a later period than baudha yana s ulvasu tra but is a little older than a pastamba s ulvasu tra and 1 text version of a talk given at the annual conference on history and development of mathematics 2018 organized by the sanskrit academy madras in collaboration with and at sri chandrasekharendra saraswati vishwa mahavidyalaya enathur kanchipuram during november 27 29 2018 under the auspices of the indian society for history of mathematics 1 http arxiv org abs 1908 00440 v 1 considerably so compared to ka tya yana s ulvasu tra the ranges assigned typi cally are 650 300 bce for ma nava and a pastamba s ulvasu tras and 400 200 for ka tya yana s ulvasu tra despite being the oldest baudha yana s ulvasu tra is found to be better organized and more elegant in its presentation among all the four while ma nava s ulvasu tra is least appealing from these considerations it has also been the one to have received least attention in terms of editions commentaries etc whether in traditional or in modern context perhaps due to its lack of appeal the first modern edition with english translation due to jeanette van gelder 12 is only a little over 50 years old while for the others similar activity was undertaken well over a hundred years ago in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries notwithstanding its lack of appeal there are some very interesting original observations in ma nava s ulvasu tra in terms of the mathematical content which in the overall context seem to have not received adequate attention i may also put in a comment here that there seems to be a tendency among the scholars in the area to view the s ulvasu tras body of knowledge mostly as a totality and the special features of the individual s ulvasu tras are scarcely highlighted except at a superficial level while on the other hand there is no doubt that comparative studies between the individual s ulvasu tras could throw a good deal of light on various aspects of the vedic civilization especially as the s ulvasu tras are from different periods and very likely also from different geographical regions in india it is the aim of this article to highlight some of the unique features of ma nava s ulvasu tra compared to the other s ulvasu tras circumferance of the circle during the ancient period around the world the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of the circle was thought to be 3 2 and the belief is also reflected in one of the su tras in baudha yana s ulvasu tra at one point there is an incidental 2 one may wonder why the value for the ratio was taken to be 3 across various cultures my hypothesis on the issue is that the idea of the ratio being 3 dates back to the time when humans were yet to think in terms of fractions except perhaps for half which may have meant a substantial portion that is not nearly the whole as commonly used even now in informal conversations rather than its precise value it may be noted that while encounter with the circle in the context of wheels is at least over 5000 years old fractions seem to have appeared on the scene in a serious way in indian as well as egyptian cultures only around the first millennium bce the ratio is thus 3 in the sense that it is not 2 or 4 or even three hand half the ingrained notion could have developed into a belief often tagged also to religious authority it was then not reconsidered for a long time even after fractions became part of human thought process the episodes such as discussed here mark a departure from the past 2 reference to this where a circular pit with diameter 1 pada and circumference 3 padas is mentioned indicating that the circumference was taken to be 3 times the diameter the issue does not feature elsewhere in baudha yana s ulvasu tra and in a pastamba and ka tya yana s ulvasu tras in the ma nava s ulvasu tra how ever one sees a recognition that the assumption is not correct a verse in ma nava 10 2 3 13 as per 7 and 11 13 as per 11 numberings states vis kambhah pan cabha gas ca vis kambhastrigun as ca yah sa man d alapariks epo na va lamatiricyate a fifth of the diameter and thrice the diameter is the circumference of a circle not a hair breadth remains vis kambha which also means supporting beam or bolt or bar of a door see 8 1 was the technical term used for the diameter of a circle man dala stands for the circle and pariks epah is the term for the circumference even though the value described is considerably off the mark the fact of recognition of the ratio being strictly greater than 3 is worth taking note of and so is the apparent exultation over the finding 3 it may be recalled here that in the jaina tradition a similar recognition is seen in su ryaprajna pti believed to be from 5 th century bce where the classical value 3 for the ratio is recalled and discarded in favour of another value 10 the values could thus be contemperanous but evidently unrelated from a historical point of view especially on account of the substantial difference in the values proposed in numerical as well as structural terms 3 in 12 and in 7 following it the verse is wrongly interpreted as concerning determination of a square with the same area as the given circle the translation of the verse is given as dividing the diameter of the circle into five parts and then individual parts into three parts each thus dividing the diameter into 15 parts and taking away two parts yields the side of a square with the same area as the circle this is accurate to a hair breadth if the translation in the first part were to be correct then it would correspond to the formula for the side of the square with area equal to that of a given circle is 13 15 seen in baudha yana at 1 60 and also in a pastamba and ka tya yana s ulvasu tras the translation however is quite erroneous in many respects occurrence of the word vis kambha twice readily shows that it is not the individual parts that are being subdivided and there is no reference at all to taking away two parts from the 15 subdivided parts besides pariks hepa unambiguously corresponds to circumference with the verb parikship meaning to surround to encircle etc see 8 1 and not the area it appears that having difficulties in interpreting the verse the translator chose to relate it to the 13 15 formula seen in the other s ulvasu tras the translation in 11 on the other hand is along the lines described here 3 a brief description of the location of the verse in the body of the ma nava s ulvasu tra would be in order here to place the verse in context section 10 3 in which the verse occurs at 10 3 2 13 4 is the last of the three sections in ma nava s ulvasu tra referred by the sulvaka ra as vais n ava the significance of the name and association with vis n u if any is not clear from the contents of the section the general narrative in the part containing the verse concerns description of construction of vedis interestingly after talking about the volume of the vedi called s amitra vedi the su traka ra states a ya mama ya magun am vista ram vistaren a tu samasya vargmu lam yat tatkarn am tadvido viduh multiply the length by the length and the width by the width it is known that adding them and taking the square root gives the hypotenuse the reader would recognize this statement as an equivalent form of what is called the pythagoras theorem with the figure in question not specified in the verse being the rectangle 5 it may also be noted that the statement is in quite a different form than in the other s ulvasu tras in a way while the other s ulvasu tras seem to be referring to geometric principle involved considering in particular the areas of the squares over the respective sides the exposition here is seen to be focussed on computing the the size of the hypotenuse from the sizes of the sides without specific reference to the underlying geometry a few verses down from there which concern practical details about the vedis and the performance of yajna we are led to another important mathematical statement involving now the construction of a circle with the same area as a square 6 in the vedic literature this issue concerns constructing the a havani ya 4 actually the 10 is superfluous in these numbers since the whole of ma nava s ulvasu tra is covered in sections of chapter 10 the numbering has to do with the translation of ma nava s rautasu tras in 12 in which the s ulvasu tra appears as chapter 10 5 7 also mentions the right angled triangle in this respect but there is no evidence on the whole of the s ulvasu tras discussing right angled triangles 6 it is argued in 6 that 10 3 2 10 gives rules both for squaring the circle and circling the square with the latter being the same as baudhayana s rule discussed earlier the rule for the other direction according to the interpretation in 6 is that given a circle the perpendicular bisector of the equilateral triangle with the diameter of the circle as the side is the side of a square with the same area as the circle the argument involves an emendation of the extant 4 which is a square and ga rhapatya which is circular with the same area 7 along with there is also the semicircular figure with the same area to be constructed for the daks in a gni the method described here for finding a circle with the same area as a given square is the same as given in baudha yana s ulvasu tra in geometrical content but formulated with a difference in an isosceles triangle produced by the diagonals of the square extend the perpendicular as much as the semidiagonal side of the triangle and of the extra part of the semidiagonal beyond the side adjoin a third part of it to the part within the square to get the radius of the circle as is well known see in particular 2 for a discussion on this this is not very accurate but is interesting as an approximate construction this is followed by two verses which concern doubling of area when measure of a side is replaced by that of the diagonal of the square this is evidently related in this context with the construction of the daks in a gni though it has not been explicitly mentioned and has also not been brought out in the translations in 7 and 11 and then comes the cited verse for the circumference of the circle what is the relevance that we can identify we see that some circles have appeared on the scene though what is involved about them are the areas nothing in the context warrants apparently consideration of the circumference however having got to the circles seems to have inspired the author to mention and that too with some gusto something interesting that he had realized namely that the circumference is not just 3 times the diameter as people thought but more than that and one would have a safe estimate by adding one fifth of the diameter thus the statement like much else actually but it bears emphasis here appears to be side input from which it would be difficult to draw further inference about the thought process that may be involved indeed one may wonder why the sulvaka ra chose the value 31 5 for the correc tion rather than something that would have been better specifically like 1 6 if not 1 7 from the context and the value itself it is clearly an ad hoc value being adopted essentially in the context of becoming aware of the classical value of 3 text which the author justifies also on considerations of grammar but with it many aspects which are unclear from the earlier translations from 12 and 11 become clearer as noted in 6 the above mentioned rule for squaring the circle is unique to ma nava s ulvasu tra the rule however is not very accurate 7 in 2 concerning the motivation for considering the problem of circling the square i had made a reference to the rathacakraciti which however seems to be an inadequate explanation the primary motivation for the problem is very likely to have been the equality of the areas of a havani ya and ga rhapatya 5 for the ratio is not satisfactory and that something remains i may reiterate here in this respect that the verse notes that not a hair breadth remains which is what atiricyate corresponds to with the verb atiric meaning to be left with a surplus see 8 and is strictly not a reference accuracy in terms of both lower and upper estimates as treated for instance in 7 but having recognized that the value should be more than 3 why and how did 31 5 come to be chosen for it the value 31 7 which would be appropriate in hindsight would perhaps would have been rather odd lacking in aesthetic appeal which is often a consideration while making ad hoc choices to think about at that time however why not say 31 6 which would have been much closer to the correct value thinking of a sixth would seem simpler and natural compared a fifth part it being half of the a third and division into three parts is easier operationally than into five parts and then halving would of course be the trivial next step the su trakara however prefers to consider division into five parts a clue for this seems to lie in the decimal place value system of representation of numbers writing numbers to base 10 as we do now for a number written in this system it is much easier to compute its fifth part than the third or any other part indeed ma nava s ulvasu tra shows preference to using decimally convenient divisions in other contexts as well the verse following the cited one for the circumference describes the size of a square inscribed in a circle viz with vertices on the circumference it may be noted that the desired size would be 1 2 times the diameter of the circle the prescription given is to divide the diameter into 10 parts and take away 3 parts thus 7 10 is used as as a n approximate value for 1 2 actually for 2 there was a standard approximate value 17 12 adopted in the s ulvasu tras according to which the desired ratio would be 12 out of 17 parts which would be more accurate but ma nava adopts the proportion 7 out of 10 suggesting preference for decimal division in the verse for a new construction for circling the square which we shall discuss in the next section there is a division into 5 parts involved it may also be recalled here that the major large unit involved in the s ulvasu tras is purus a and there is a subunit aratni which is a 5 th part of purus a this may also be looked upon as a factor related to the use of the decimal system which would have encouraged considering division into 5 parts i may also recall here that in the construction of various vedis that are described division by 5 is involved in many computations we conclude this discussion with another small related observation granting that the value of the circumference to diameter ratio was recognized by the sulvaka ra as being greater than 3 and that he looked for additional decimal 6 parts after which nothing will remain 1 5 is the right choice 1 10 would have been closer but it is less than the correct value 3 circling the square as noted in the last section the problem of circling the square viz of de scribing a circle with the same area as a given square had attained considerable importance in the s ulvasu tras period it may be emphasized that the frame work envisaged for the problem is quite different from the analogous problems in greek mathematics where the constructions were sought to be performed with only the ruler and compass and any comparison of the achievements of the an cient indians in the context of the greeks not having been successful with the problem are facile and irrelevant the constructions given are important in terms of historical development of mathematical ideas and need to be viewed only as such we have gone over the geometric construction given in baudha yana s ulvasu tra for drawing a circle with the same as a given square as noted there the result it produces is not very accurate and in fact involves an error of the order of 1 7 percent see 2 for more details in this respect in course of time the suspi cions would have gained weight serving as motivation to look for an alternative construction and one seems to find such an attempted construction in ma nava s ulvasu tra which we shall now discuss the construction in question is described in a verse which follows right after the contents discussed in the last section here in 10 3 2 15 as per the numbering of 7 and 11 15 of 11 the verse is caturasram navadha kurya t dhanuh kot istridha tridha utsedha tpan camam lumpetpur s eneh ta vatsamam the first part of the verse may be translated quite unambiguously as divide the square into nine parts by dividing the horizontal and vertical sides into three parts each unfortunately arriving at the right translation of the rather terse second part of the verse and its interpretation call for additional inputs of contextual nature and want of these seems to have confused earlier translators in 11 the authors translate the second part as 7 drop out the fifth portion in the centre and fill it up with loose earth and in the commentary section they comment possibly these are not problems of quadrature of the circle ordinary squares are drawn without any mathematical significance the comment seems quite unwarranted though it may be emphasized there that nothing in the verse specifically indicates that it does concern a quadrature formula or procedure towards one in 7 following 12 the second part is interpreted in marathi and hindi equivalents as from the part jutting out take away one fifth part and draw a circle with the remaining part as the radius here the word utsedha is interpreted to mean the part of the trisectors arrived at in the first part that is jutting out on either side of the square until meeting the circle passing through the vertices of the square one fifth of that is sub tracted from the segment of the trisector upto its midpoint and the remaining part is taken as the radius of the prescribed circle implementing the procedure accordingly they calculate the radius it however turns out to be much too large for the corresponding circle to have the same area as the square thus putting the interpretation into question but the matter is left at that with no comment another interpretation of the verse was given by r c gupta 4 see also 5 here utsedha is interpreted to mean height and is associated with the height viz the radius of the semicircle from the circle through the vertices of the square thus the author infers that the radius of the prescribed circle is meant to be 4 5 th of the circumscribing circle with this interpretation the area of the circle produced starting with the unit square works out to be 8 25 and thus the procedure corresponds to a value of as 25 8 this is a good value by the s ulvasu tras standards however the interpretation is unsatisfactory in various ways first and foremost the interpretation does not involve the first part of the verse at all it is inconceivable that the sulvaka ra first asks you to elaborately divide the square into nine parts and in the following line gives a procedure for the quadrature problem which has nothing to with the subdivision secondly in the second part if it was just the radius of the circumscribing circle to be used as a reference why would it be referred to with the unusual word utsedha which 8 does not occur anywhere else in ma nava or in other s ulvasu tras rather than in terms of the diameter of the circle which is something that occurs so frequently in s ulvasu tras geometry for a faithful interpretation of the verse it seems imperative that it must involve the trisectors of square introduced in the first part also utsedha must have something to do with the trisectors and the choice of the unusual term must have to do with that the trisectors also do not occur anywhere else thus it would seem that the interpretation in 12 and 7 is on the right track inasmuch as it focusses on considering individually the lines trisecting the given square along each of the sides extended upto the circle passing through the vertices of the circle the circle is indeed being described in terms of certain points on these lines the main difficulty however seems to be in understanding which points are meant evidently the interpretation with regard to the points and how they are to be used see more on this below adopted in 12 and 7 does not seem to the right one as it is way off the mark the overall formulations and symmetry considerations suggests that we are to pick two points on each of the four lines that trisect the square along a side located symmetrically and hence at the same distance from the centre of the square and the circle through these points is the desired circle this in a way explains the explication through covering with loose earth as the totality of the eight points is indicative of a circle which is what is to be covered now which are the two points on each of the lines one would be in a better position to figure out what the sulvaka ra s line of thought if one keeps in mind the baudha yana construction of the circle described earlier recall that there the bisector of the square is extended until meeting the circle through the vertices and 1 3 rd of the part is added to the segment within to get the radius of the circle that is sought after one can alternatively think of this as identifying the point through which the circle should pass the centre of the circle is of course understood to be the centre of the square the new idea now is that instead of the bisectors of the squares we are considering the trisectors on the bisectors the points in question were chosen to be at 1 3 rd of the jutting out part from the side of the square one now needs to look for a similar number and the analogous point on the trisectors to complete the analogous construction the number is picked to be 1 5 th the choice could have been based on intuition and the point is now meant to be on the trisector at 1 5 th of the jutting out part from the side of the square at this point the analogy with the baudha yana construction throws open to our minds two possibilities one is to take the segment of the trisector 9 upto the point thus constructed either from the midpoint of the trisector or the centre of the square in the case of the baudha yana construction with the bisector the two coincide but here they are different for some reason in 7 the former interpretation is favoured with respect to the point picked there on which was commented upon above however viewed in the full context it is the other interpretation that may be seen to be more appropriate the sulvaka ras do not in general try describe a number for the radius but a region to be covered determined by some point or a collection of points and secondly in the overall context of the description of the construction the midpoint of the trisector has no relevance and has not been referred to once these points are noted the inference would be that the prescribed circle passing through the point s as above on the trisectors at one fifth of the jutting out part from the side of the square one may now rewrite the interpretation of the second part referring to the collection of the 8 points as on the parts jutting out mark the points at one fifth from the square and draw the circle through them a simple calculation shows that for a square with unit side length the radius of the circle is 1 2 1 1 5 17 3 1 2 1 18 and this yields the area of the circle to be 0 994 a much more accurate value compared to the earlier one with an error of only about 0 5 in place of 1 7 see 2 for details of the calculations and other related comments thus from a mathematical point of view this turns out to be a good choice we see also that it emerges naturally as a generalization of the baudha yana construction in terms of development of ideas thus it seems reasonable to expect that this is what the sulvaka ra had in mind the inter pretation incorporates all the components of the verse and all the ingredients needed in the formulation may be seen to be present in the verse in their natural order the author is hopeful that the interpretation would be confirmed to be valid by expert sanskritists from a linguistic point of view possibly after some emendation that could be could be justified based on considerations of corruption on account of one or other factors references 1 vaman shivram apte the students sanskrit english
