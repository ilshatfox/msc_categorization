the cartesian method and fermat s last theorem by hector ivan nunez hinunez unah hn abstract we prove fermat s last theorem using the philosophical and mathematical knowledge of 1637 when french mathematician pierre de fermat claimed to have a proof of his conjecture our strategy consists in setting three variables of the fermat s equation as integers and then we evaluate if the remaining variable can be an integer as well we assert that at least an irrational number is needed to satisfy fermat s equation we confirm that fermat s last theorem is valid 1 introduction while a proof of fermat s last theorem has already been accomplished by sir andrew wiles in 1995 there is a gap of scientific knowledge of proving it using the simple mathematical machinery available when it was conjectured by pierre de fermat in 1637 in this paper we present important progress toward filling that gap in that regard we consider the philosophical method of analysis today known as the cartesian method 1 which was coincidentally proposed in the latter mentioned year 1637 by the french rene descartes some steps of this method consist of dividing a complex problem into as many parts as possible until its fundamental composition is found then we have to solve those simple parts that appear afterwards group them and synthesize the problem it is well known that fermat s last theorem also referred to as the fermat wiles theorem has a mathematical structure remarkably similar to the pythagorean the orem one may ask whether the fermat s claim can be studied using the cartesian method with analogies to the pythagorean theorem in fact that is what our exposi tion is about and we give an affirmative answer to that question there is a lot of historical literature 2 about this famous theorem therefore we just say its statement if n is an integer greater than 2 then there are no positive integers a b c that satisfy the equation an bn cn the author is grateful to professor danny guerrero phd for his valuable support and making useful suggestions danny guerrero unah edu hn this research was accomplished during the covid 19 pandemic 1 ar x iv 2 10 6 11 77 5 v 4 m at h g m 1 3 a ug 2 02 1 to prove fermat s last theorem we begin by developing a geometric represen tation of the equation an bn cn next we study the arithmetic structure of that equation in the event that a b c n are positive integers with n 2 then we divide the problem in two parts one when n is even and the other when n is odd both with n 2 and as a b c positive integers when n is even we use the fundamental theorem of arithmetic and again we divide the problem into simple parts using analogies to the pythagorean theorem we investigate whether in these parts it is possible that a simplified form of the equation an bn cn is valid the concept of pythagorean triples makes a final invitation to divide the problem into several more parts once again the pythagorean triples points out that such equation is not valid since in the triple a b c there are no three integers but at least an irrational number next we consider perfect square numbers to solve the remaining case when n is odd greater than 2 square numbers provide a link to the case when a b c are any positive integer and n is odd by contradiction we find that in the triple a b c there are no three integers but at least an irrational number finally when we synthesize results in a proof of fermat s last theorem expand ing the scope of work in section 5 we show some applications definition 1 define an bn cn a fermat s equation particularly a primitive fermat s equation is when gcd a b c 1 assumptions we will analyze primitive fermat s equations only it suffices to our proof since non primitive fermat s equations is simply a multiple of those additionally consider that the universe of discourse has a partition of three disjoint sets namely z q and qc such that z q z qc q qc and z q qc r next section clears up this notation 2 notation a b c n arbitrary positive integers with b a c and n 2 a b c a triple gcd a b c greatest common divisor of the integers a b c d s positive odd integers k p q r positive integers z the set of positive integers q the subset of positive rational numbers excluding positive integers then p q such that q 6 0 q 6 1 and gcd p q 1 qc positive irrational numbers which are neither integers nor rationals r the set of positive real numbers abc a triangle with a b c vertexes x y real numbers even positive even integers odd positive odd integers 2 3 mathematical structure of fermat s last theorem 3 1 geometric representation this section 3 1 is devoted to developing a geometric representation of the equation an bn cn in the space of real numbers that will help us to understand the dy namics of the four variables a b c n from a geometrical point of view specially when they are set as integers this geometry will be referenced in lemma 3 and section 5 the equation an bn cn can be written as a function of n as c n n an bn we can graph this equation in the x y cartesian plane where x y r n is the independent variable and c is the dependent variable let us graph the geometric representation of the equation c n n an bn in a pythagorean way like a triangle in the first quadrant of the x y cartesian plane we draw an abc triangle which has one side of length a and another of length b the third side is set to a length of c n an bn the side a is drawn from point 0 0 to a 0 and side b has one end fixed at a 0 let vertex c be able to freely rotate according to the circle drawn by side b from point a 0 notice that the location of vertex c depends on the value of n since b a c then vertex c of abc cannot touch the circle drawn by side a from 0 0 as n rises in value the vertex c approaches this circular area if n goes down in value vertex c rotates to the right approaching the x axis when n 1 these and other details are illustrated in figure 1 figure 1 fermat s last theorem graphed as a more general representation than pythagoras theorem let s be the space formed by the points x y such that a b c n r in the equation cn an bn with n 2 that space is shown in the shaded area of figure 1 and is bounded between the arc inclusive and it is when a b arc b not inclusive because c a and line b not inclusive because n 2 3 certain relevant characteristics to fermat s last theorem appear in this area suppose that a and b are positive integers then there are b arcs and for each of them there could be certain points for the vertex c such that c is also a positive integer in section 5 1 we prove that n and are irrationals in that point since we have supposed that a b z and c n r from figure 1 follows that the minimum c is when c a and n the maximum c in the arc occurs when a b and n 2 hence a c a 2 remark abc tends to be an equilateral triangle whenever a b and n if a b and n then abc tends to be an isosceles triangle if 1 n 2 then abc is obtuse and for n 2 the abc is acute at n 2 it abc is a right triangle 3 2 arithmetical structure here we develop some simple but useful concepts that are so often needed to apply contradiction techniques 3 that they deserve singling out lemma 1 suppose equation an bn cn is valid for a b c n positive integers and n 2 then a single element of the triple a b c is even proof let us prove by contradiction any odd raised to a positive integer power is odd and any even raised to a positive integer power is even the sum of two odd numbers is even and the sum of an odd with an even is odd therefore it is impossible that in the equation cn an bn we have a triple a b c with all its elements odd because otherwise we would have that an odd number is equal to an even which is absurd suppose that in the triple a b c we have two even and one odd if the odd is c then the sum an bn is even then the equality is absurd if c is even then the sum of an odd and an even number in an bn is odd then the equality is also absurd therefore in the triple a b c there not exist two even and one odd the case when the three elements of the triple a b c are even is not considered since in the introduction assumptions we have stated that the equation cn an bn is simplified then a b c have no common factors corollary 1 suppose equation an bn cn is valid for a b c n positive integers and n 2 applying the fundamental theorem of arithmetic implies that this equation has one of the following three forms 2 kd n an bn a b d are odd and k z 1 cn an 2 kd n a c d are odd and k z 2 cn 2 kd n bn b c d are odd and k z 3 remark notice that equations 2 and 3 look alike from the commutative prop erty of addition point of view but we have stated that b a c then to keep generality and formality the three equations will be evaluated individually by cases 4 lemma 2 suppose cn an bn has a b n as positive integers with n 2 then c is not a fractional number furthermore c z or c qc proof let us prove by contradiction assume that c q such that c p q then the equation cn an bn can be written as p q n an bn the right hand side of the equal sign is a positive integer since a b n z however the left hand side is a fractional number since p q n is irreducible therefore the equality is absurd corollary 2 suppose that two elements in a b c are positive integers then to satisfy equation cn an bn with n 2 the third element is not a fractional number lemma 3 let b a c if n is an integer greater than 2 then there are no positive integers a b c that satisfy the equation an bn cn when b a in particular fermat s last theorem is valid proof if b a then a b z rewriting equation 1 gives 2 kd b n a b n 1 if n 2 then 2 kd b qc since there is no pythagorean triple that has number 1 in the triple in fact we have that a b a b 2 1 a b 1 let us generalize for n 2 from figure 1 we observe that if n increases then c 2 kd decreases thus 2 kd b decreases therefore a b n a b n 1 a b 1 substituting a b 2 kd b a b 1 awfully good the number 2 kd b is locked down between two continuous inte gers by corollary 2 follows that 2 kd qc corollary 3 if n is an integer greater than 2 then there are no positive integers a b c that satisfy the equation an bn cn when a b in particular fermat s last theorem is valid proof it is a special case of lemma 3 additionally observe that if a b then from equation 1 results 2 kd a n 2 therefore 2 kd qc proposition 1 suppose a b c n are integers and n 2 then gcd a b c 1 if and only if gcd an bn cn 1 4 fermat s last theorem proof 4 1 n is an even integer greater than 2 according to the cartesian method to find the fundamental concepts we should divide the problem as much as possible let us divide the corollary 1 equations in two parts one for d 1 and the other for d 1 once finding the fundamental concepts will work up to the most difficult when synthesizing it will be proved that fermat s last theorem is valid when n is even greater than 2 5 4 1 1 d 1 lemma 4 let n be even greater than 2 then there are no positive integers a b c that satisfy the equation an bn cn when one element in the triple a b c has the form 2 k where k z in particular fermat s last theorem is valid proof by contradiction we will prove that 2 k qc according to lemma 1 in a b c there exist one even and two odd let us assume that the even is 2 k where k z next by cases we analyze the three equations of corollary 1 with d 1 case 1 notice that the left hand side of equation 1 with d 1 is 2 k which is an even integer since k 6 0 for b a 2 k since gcd a b 2 k 1 by lemma 1 we know that a and b are odd summarizing we have a primitive fermat s equation with n as an even integer greater than 2 a and b are odd c 2 k even k z b a 2 k and it is as follows 2 kn an bn 4 let us do an artifice rewriting equation 4 similarly to pythagoras theorem gives 2 kn 2 2 an 2 2 bn 2 2 5 remark since n is an even integer and a b are odd then an 2 and bn 2 are odd and 2 kn 2 is even besides the upper exponent is 2 and gcd an 2 bn 2 2 kn 2 1 clearly a necessary condition for equation 5 is that an 2 bn 2 2 kn 2 must be a primitive pythagorean triple pythagorean triples has been studied since babylonians between 1900 bc and 1600 bc 4 today we know that the euclid s formula is a generator of all primitive pythagorean triples but not all the non primitives 5 recall that gcd a b 2 k 1 then we are interested in primitives only which requires that the hypotenuse 2 kn 2 is odd but it contradicts the fact that 2 kn 2 is even therefore equation 4 is impossible with integers lemma 2 and corollary 2 assert that 2 k q then within a b 2 k there exist at least an irrational number since a b are odd then 2 k qc case 2 suppose equation 2 with d 1 then the equation to analyze is cn an 2 kn 6 rewriting equation 6 analogously to the pythagorean theorem gives cn 2 2 an 2 2 2 kn 2 2 7 remark since n is even and c a are odd then cn 2 an 2 are odd and 2 kn 2 is even besides the upper exponent is 2 and gcd a 2 k c gcd an 2 2 kn 2 cn 2 1 cer tainly a necessary condition for equation 7 is that an 2 2 kn 2 cn 2 must be a primitive pythagorean triple 6 diophantus may have written the euclid s formula as we know it today 4 it points out that to generate primitive pythagorean triples the integers an 2 2 kn 2 and cn 2 must satisfy the following equations for two relatively primes p and q with p q and not both odd cn 2 p 2 q 2 8 an 2 p 2 q 2 9 2 kn 2 2 pq 10 solving for p in equation 10 gives p 2 kn 2 2 q substituting p in equation 8 gives cn 2 2 kn 2 2 q 2 q 2 which is simplified as cn 2 2 kn 2 q 2 q 2 11 first consider equation 11 when q is even 1 suppose q 2 2 kn 2 squaring both sides of equation 10 gives 2 kn 2 q 2 which is a contradiction therefore it is impossible that q 2 2 kn 2 2 assume q is even such that q 2 2 kn 2 and 2 kn 2 6 q 2 then cn 2 is even contradicting the fact that cn 2 is odd hence it is impossible 3 if q is even such that q 2 2 kn 2 then cn 2 q which contradicts that cn 2 is odd therefore it is impossible that q 2 2 kn 2 secondly consider q is odd 1 suppose q 1 solving equation 9 gives p 2 an 2 1 substituting in equation 8 and rewriting gives cn 2 an 2 2 such equality is impossible since a and c are odd with a c and the minimum difference between them is 2 but when raising a and c to an integer power greater than 1 then the difference is greater than 2 therefore cn 2 an 2 2 which is a contradiction hence q 1 is impossible 2 assume q is odd greater than 1 then cn 2 q since q 2 2 kn 2 contradicting the fact that cn 2 is odd therefore q odd greater than 1 is impossible thus equation 6 cannot be satisfied with integers from corollary 2 follows that within a 2 k c there exist at least an irrational number since a c are odd clearly 2 k qc case 3 suppose equation 3 with d 1 then the equation to analyze is cn 2 kn bn similarly to case 2 and using the commutative property of sum it is concluded by contradiction that 2 k qc remark in general the value of lemma 3 is that it proves that n pn qn is irrational when n is even greater than 2 and p q are any positive integer with p q furthermore notice that if k is not a positive integer then 2 k must be irrational to satisfy fermat s equation 7 4 1 2 d is odd greater than 1 by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic 2 kd with k z and d odd represents all positive even integers let us approach the case when d 1 clearly if we apply the transitive axiom of equality among 2 h n an bn and 2 kd by lemma 4 case 1 follows that 2 kd 2 h qc a similar situation occurs in cases 2 and 3 next lemma shows a formal proof and next corollary covers all cases when d 1 lemma 5 let n be even greater than 2 then there are no positive integers a b c that satisfy the equation an bn cn when one element in the triple a b c has the form 2 kd where k z and d is odd greater than 1 in particular fermat s last theorem is valid proof let us analyze the equation cn an bn by cases case 1 suppose equation 1 such that d is an odd integer greater than 1 and k z notice that 2 kd can be expressed as 2 h with h r then 2 kd 2 h using lemma 4 case 1 with c 2 h and a b odd such that 2 h n an bn follows that 2 h qc therefore 2 kd 2 h qc by contradiction 2 kd qc case 2 suppose equation 2 such that d is odd greater than 1 and k z observe that 2 kd can be expressed as 2 h with h r then 2 kd 2 h invoking lemma 4 case 2 with b 2 h and a c odd such that cn an 2 h n it is concluded that 2 h qc therefore by contradiction 2 kd qc case 3 suppose equation 3 when d is odd d 1 and n is even n 2 analogously applying lemma 4 case 3 follows that in cn 2 h n bn we have 2 h 2 kd qc 4 1 3 synthesis for n as an even integer greater than 2 corollary 4 fermat s last theorem is true for all n even integers greater than 2 proof it follows from combining lemma 4 and lemma 5 the objective of this section 4 1 has been reached next we will address the other half of the proof 4 2 n is an odd integer greater than 2 our approach to this case is via mathematical artifices to make the corollary 1 equations look like if n were even and therefore enabling us to use what has been proved in section 4 1 again let us address the problem by cases first we will consider triples a b c that have perfect square numbers only and afterwards will generalize it for any positive integer within the triple 8 4 2 1 a b c are perfect square numbers lemma 6 let n be odd greater than 2 then there are no perfect square numbers a b c that satisfy the equation an bn cn in particular fermat s last theorem is valid proof consider the three equations of corollary 1 where a b c is a triple with three perfect square numbers by contradiction we will prove that 2 kd qc case 1 suppose equation 1 where a b are odd and 2 kd is even and all of them are perfect square numbers rewriting that equation similarly to pythagoras theorem gives 2 kd n 2 2 an 2 2 bn 2 2 12 remark since a b 2 kd are positive and perfect square numbers if we apply to each of them a square root they are still integers recall that we are considering positive numbers only therefore an 2 bn 2 are odd and 2 kd n 2 is even it is evident that a necessary condition for equation 12 is that an 2 bn 2 2 kd n 2 must be a primitive pythagorean triple let us consider a similar procedure as shown in section 4 1 1 let d 1 this case is proved following a similar reasoning as shown in lemma 4 case 1 under the here mentioned conditions therefore by contradiction 2 k qc 2 let d 1 and d is odd this case is proved following similar steps as explained in lemma 5 case 1 therefore by contradiction we assert that 2 kd qc 3 synthesizing 2 kd qc case 2 suppose equation 2 where a c are odd and 2 kd is even and all of them are perfect square numbers suppose n is an odd integer greater than 2 let us follow an analogous procedure as shown in case 1 invoking the procedure of lemma 4 case 2 and lemma 5 case 2 we conclude that 2 kd qc case 3 suppose equation 3 where b c are odd and 2 kd is even and all of them are perfect square numbers let us follow an analogous procedure as shown in case 1 invoking the procedure of lemma 4 case 3 and lemma 5 case 3 we conclude that 2 kd qc corollary 5 let n be odd greater than 2 suppose a b c is a triple with two odd perfect square numbers then the other element in the triple is irrational in particular fermat s last theorem is valid 4 2 2 generalization to a b c as positive integers let us consider the arithmetical structure of equations that has the form cn an bn where a b c has two odd perfect square numbers and an irrational by simplicity 9 sake we are not interested in equations that have even perfect square numbers and an irrational since they are not aligned to corollary 5 however one may see that same conclusions arise in that situation lemma 7 let n be odd greater than 2 then there are no integers a b c that satisfy the equation an bn cn in particular fermat s last theorem is valid proof let us present a direct proof case 1 consider the equation 2 kd 2 n a 2 n b 2 n where 2 kd 2 a 2 and b 2 are perfect square numbers a b d n are any odd and n 2 by corollary 5 follows that 2 kd 2 qc considering the fact that b a c we solve for b 2 n as follows 2 kd 2 b 2 n a 2 b 2 n 1 13 since 2 kd 2 qc and b 2 is odd then 2 kd 2 b 2 is irrational and can be expressed as 2 hd such that 2 hd qc particularly 2 h qc and d is odd substituting 2 hd 2 kd 2 b 2 in equation 13 then we have a valid equation with the following structure 2 hd n a b 2 n 1 14 where 2 hd qc a b d n are any odd n 2 additionally a b 1 and 2 hd n 1 next we will do a mathematical artifice to transfer the existing irrationality in the left hand side of the equal sign in equation 14 to the right hand side let 2 hd be a positive even integer 1 suppose a b it is impossible because contradicts that 2 hd is integer 2 assume b a by lemma 3 it is impossible because contradicts that 2 hd is integer 3 suppose b a by corollary 2 and the fact that 1 1 n it is impossible because contradicts that 2 hd is integer remark if 2 hd z then a necessary condition for equation 14 is that a b 2 qc therefore a b qc which implies that a or b qc case 2 consider the equation c 2 n a 2 n 2 kd 2 n where c 2 a 2 are perfect square numbers a c d n are any odd n 2 analogously to case 1 we have a valid equation with the following structure c a 2 n 1 2 hd n with 2 hd qc and a c are odd and c a 1 let 2 hd be a positive even integer then a or c qc case 3 consider the equation c 2 n 2 kd 2 n b 2 n where b 2 c 2 are perfect square numbers b c d n are any odd n 2 analogously to case 1 we have a valid equation with the following structure c b 2 n 2 hd n 1 where 2 hd qc and b c are odd and c b 1 let 2 hd be a positive even integer then b or c qc 10 4 2 3 synthesis for n as an odd integer greater than 2 corollary 6 fermat s last theorem is true for all n odd integers greater than 2 4 3 synthesis for n as an integer greater than 2 theorem 1 fermat s last theorem if n is an integer greater than 2 then there are no positive integers a b c that satisfy the equation an bn cn proof in section 4 1 we proved that fermat s last theorem is valid when n is even greater than 2 whereas in section 4 2 we proved that it is also valid when n is odd greater than 2 in all cases happened that within a b c there exists at least an irrational number synthesizing we confirm that fermat s last theorem is valid it is impossible for any number which is a power greater than the second to be written as the sum of two like powers rei demonstra tionem mirabilem sane detexi hanc marginis exiguitas non caperet pierre de fermat 5 final considerations 5 1 applications of fermat s last theorem the scottish mathematician john napier published his method of logarithms in 1614 just some years before the fermat s claim since we aim to use the mathematical knowledge of that poque we will apply logarithms to show some applications of fermat s last theorem theorem 1 today also known as fermat wiles theorem lemma 8 suppose a b c are positive integers that satisfy equation an bn cn then n is irrational proof our first task is to consider the cartesian method of analysis so we divide the problem in simple parts and then synthesize let us present a direct proof 1 suppose that a b c are positive integers where one of them has the form 2 k with k z and gcd a b c 1 case 1 assume a primitive fermat s equation with c 2 k then 2 kn an bn solving for the exponent kn gives kn log 2 a n bn 15 consider the logarithmic argument in equation 15 by the fundamental the orem of arithmetic we claim that an bn 2 rs where r s z and s is odd by theorem 1 follows that n z for n 2 then n q or n qc 11 rewriting equation 15 gives kn r log 2 s 16 a suppose s 1 clearly log 2 s qc since k r z then a necessary condition for equation 16 is that n qc b the case when s 1 is absurd because otherwise equation 16 contradicts theorem 1 therefore n qc since it is obvious that n q therefore n qc case 2 suppose b 2 k let cn an 2 rs similarly to case 1 n qc case 3 consider a 2 k let cn bn 2 rs therefore n qc 2 suppose that a b c are positive integers where two of them are odd while the other has the form 2 kd with k z and d is odd greater than 1 additionally gcd a b c 1 similarly to the previous item solving for kn gives kn r log 2 s log 2 dn notice that theorem 1 implies s 6 dn moreover the sum is well defined and it is irrational whenever n is integer or rational it is evident that n q since k is integer a necessary condition for the equality is that n qc 3 observe that item 1 is a special case of item 2 when d 1 combining item 1 and 2 follows that in general n qc figure 1 illustrates the range of n lemma 9 there are no rational numbers a b c n such that an bn cn proof let us present a direct proof let a p q b t u c v w q and n r recall that the subset q has elements such that the numerator and denominator are positive integers and the denominator is neither 0 nor 1 let us construct a fermat s equation and do some algebra with those numbers v w n p q n t u n v w n pu n qt n qu n vqu w n pu n qt n vqu n puw n tqw n theorem 1 ensures that n is not an integer greater than 2 besides lemma 8 states that n is strictly irrational therefore n 6 q see the range of n in figure 1 lemma 10 the angle in figure 1 is irrational proof it follows from cosines law c 2 a 2 b 2 2 ab cos and theorem 1 12 5 2 principles of analysis using complex numbers notice that we may easily generalize theorem 1 for a b c n when they are nonzero integers and n 0 1 2 now that we have a complete analysis of fermat s equation within real numbers one may ask how this equation behaves within complex numbers probably could be simpler or even more complex we do not pretend to answer that question here but at least we leave a first step toward that purpose observe that beyond real numbers c n n an bn is not a one to one function since has multiple non real solutions this follows from demoivre s theorem named after french mathematician abraham de moivre 1667 1754 god alone is the author of all the motions in the world cogito ergo sum rene descartes notes if b 1 2 3 then in arc figure 1 there not exist a vertex c such that c z since n an bn qc for all a z and n 2 the maximum number of vertices c that exist in arc with a b c z and n r is h such that h ba 3 2 1 c b 0 2599 ac by definition of logarithms log 2 s x 2 x s recall that s is odd greater than 1 suppose that x q such that x p q and q 6 0 then 2 p sq which is absurd because the left hand side of the equal sign is even while the right hand side is odd therefore by contradiction log 2 s qc similarly log 2 dn qc references 1
