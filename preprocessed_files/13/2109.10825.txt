extensions r s and the poset r s of their subextensions with a special look at fcp extensions extensions such that r s is artinian and noether ian when the extension has fcp we show that there exists a co integral closure that is a least element r in r s such that r s is integral replacing the integral property by the inte grally closed property we are able to prove a similar result for an fcp extension the radicial closure of r in s is well known we are able to exhibit a suitable separable closure of r in s in case the extension has fcp and then results are similar to those of field theory the fcp property being always guaranteed we discuss when an extension has a co subintegral or a co infra integral clo sure our theory is made easier by using anodal extensions these co closures exist for example when the extension is catenarian an interesting special case for the study of distributive extensions to appear in a forthcoming paper 1 introduction and notation we consider the category of commutative and unital rings whose epimorphisms will be involved if r s is a ring extension we denote by r s the set of all r subalgebras of s we set r s r s r s with a similar definition for r s or r s then r s endowed with the partial order is a lattice called the lattice of the extension now r s is the conductor of the extension r s the integral closure of r in s is denoted by r s or by r if no confusion can occur the aim of this paper is to introduce or revisit various relative clo sures or hulls associated to ring extensions but we will mainly work in the context of fcp or fip extensions whose meanings are defined be low we emphasize that these restricted contexts produce results that 2010 mathematics subject classification primary 13 b 02 13 b 22 secondary 13 b 40 key words and phrases fcp extension minimal extension integral extension pru fer extension closure co closure 1 http arxiv org abs 2109 10825 v 1 2 g picavet and m picavet may not be valid in an arbitrary context actually some of them are established because we need them in forthcoming papers for example when we characterize extensions whose lattices are distributive note also that many of them have their own interest the extension r s is said to have fip for the finitely many intermediate algebras property or is an fip extension if r s is finite a chain of r subalgebras of s is a set of elements of r s that are pairwise comparable with respect to inclusion we will say that r s is chained if r s is a chain we also say that the extension r s has fcp or is an fcp extension if each chain in r s is finite or equivalently its lattice is artinian and noetherian clearly each extension that satisfies fip must also satisfy fcp dobbs and the authors characterized fcp and fip extensions 4 our main tool are the minimal ring extensions a concept that was introduced by ferrand olivier 8 recall that an extension r s is called minimal if r s r s an extension r s is called simple if s r t for some t s a minimal extension is simple the key connection between the above ideas is that if r s has fcp then any maximal necessarily finite chain c of r subalgebras of s r r 0 r 1 rn 1 rn s with length c n results from juxtaposing n minimal extensions ri ri 1 0 i n 1 an fcp extension is finitely generated and module finite if integral for any extension r s the length r s of r s is the supremum of the lengths of chains of r subalgebras of s notice that if r s has fcp then there does exist some maximal chain of r subalgebras of s with length r s 5 theorem 4 11 an fcp extension r s is called catenarian if all the maximal chains of r s have the same length we study such extensions in 25 recall that an extension r s is called pru fer if r t is a flat epimorphism for each t r s or equivalently if r s is a normal pair 11 theorem 5 2 p 47 it follows that a pru fer integral extension is an isomorphism the pru fer hull of an extension r s is the greatest pru fer subextension r of r s 19 in 21 we defined an extension r s to be quasi pru fer if it can be factored r r s where r r is integral and r s is pru fer an fcp extension is quasi pru fer 21 corollary 3 4 an extension r s is called almost pru fer if r s is integral or equivalently when r s is fip if s r r 21 theorem 4 6 an almost pru fer extension is quasi pru fer closures and co closures 3 1 1 a summary of the main results any undefined material is explained in the next sections and at the end of this section where the reader may find standard results on minimal extensions ring extensions admit numerous closures and we add in this paper some more one of our aims is to define dual closures for example like the co integral closure of a ring extension these dual closures exist for fcp extensions but the reader is warned that they do not for arbitrary extensions we think that the main reason is that fcp extensions have artinian and noetherian lattices although proofs most of time rely on induction over tower of minimal extensions for a ring extension r s section 2 recalls some known facts about the seminormalization and the t closure of r in s we also recall less known facts about the u closure of r in s that can be found in a comprehensive study of the first author 15 also some technical results about these closures that are needed in the sequel are established in the fcp context we have postponed deeper results on the u closure in section 5 because it is interwoven with another closure theorem 5 8 shows that the t closure of an integral fcp extension is the composite of its u closure and its seminormalization we show that an fcp extension r s has a co integral closure r containing r with equality if and only if the extension is almost pru fer theorems 3 5 and 3 7 we give an fip example of an almost pru fer extension example 3 9 in section 3 we consider the elements t r s such that r t is integrally closed evidently the pru fer hull ofr in s is such an element we are interested in extensions that have a greatest integrally closed subextension for example if the extension is chained another example is a quasi pru fer extension for example an fcp extension in some cases this greatest element t verifies t s is integral and could have been considered as a co integral closure but it is not always the case actually the right co integral closure is defined in section 3 we consider in section 4 some closures linked to the properties of their residual field extensions kubota introduced the radicial closure of a ring extension 12 reconsidered by manaresi under another name 14 the second author considered a weaker closure 27 another type of ring extensions that are linked to residual extensions are the unramified extensions of algebraic geometry in order to unify these concepts if p is a property of field extensions we say that an ex tension is a p extension if all its residual extensions verify p for example a radicial extension is a radicial i extension as a first result we show that an unramified radicial fcp integral extension is trivial 4 g picavet and m picavet proposition 4 2 we give some properties of unramified extensions in the fcp context we introduce a new concept the separable ex tensions within the framework of integral extensions this concept is more tractable than the unramified property they coincide in some cases an integral t closed fcp extension is unramified if and only if it is separable corollary 4 4 an important result is that an fcp integral extension r s admits a separable closure sr such that sr s is radicial theorem 4 12 and corollary 4 13 in section 5 we give properties of u integral extensions and an odal u closed extensions valid in the fcp context for example an fcp integral extension is u integral if and only if it is locally an epi morphism in which case the extension is unramified theorem 5 7 moreover an integral fcp extension is anodal if and only if it is an i extension proposition 5 2 we also examine the links between the u closure and the other closures or properties previously considered we then introduce the unramified closure sr of a ring extension r s and show that sr s is u closed in case the extension is integral and has fcp proposition 5 13 results of section 5 about the radicial property may not hold in section 6 we consider dual closures of the seminormalizations and t closures of ring extensions this may seem weird but in a forth coming paper on distributive fcp extensions these new closures are an essential tool the reader is warned that these closures may not exist but exist in the context we have to consider a co subintegral closure of a ring extension r s is the least t r s such that t s is subintegral the co infra integral closure is similarly defined we give some generalities about these closures and their properties for example an infra integral fcp extension admits a co subintegral closure we then compare all the closures we have introduced with these dual closures now considering an integral fcp extension r s and setting t u r s u s subintegral we get that the co subintegral closure exists if and only if t s is catenarian resp subintegral in which case t is the co subintegral closure theorem 6 15 as a corollary we have that if in addition the extension is cate narian the co subintegral closure exists we have similar results for the co infra integral closure but the proofs are much more involved the rest of the paper exhibits examples where these dual closures exist or not section 7 explores the cardinality of lattices of integral fip exten sions some results are linked to co subintegral closures and comple ments a striking result is theorem 7 11 which says that if r s is an fip integral extension over the local ring r then r s is the sum closures and co closures 5 of the number of the complements of the t closure tsr in all extensions r s for each r s r tsr tsr s 1 2 definitions and notation a local ring is here what is called elsewhere a quasi local ring as usual spec r and max r are the set of prime and maximal ideals of a ring r for an extension r s and an ideal i of r we write vs i p spec s i p and ds i for its complement the support of an r module e is suppr e p spec r ep 6 0 and msuppr e suppr e max r we denote by lr e the length of e as an r module when r s is an extension we will set supp t r suppr t r and supp s t suppr s t for each t r s unless otherwise specified let r s be a ring extension for t r s an element u r s is called a complement of t if t u r and tu s if t has a unique complement this complement is denoted by t o if r s is an extension and t r s we say that the extension splits at t if msupp s t msupp t r in 26 theorem 4 8 we proved that if an fcp extension splits at t then t has a unique complement t o let r s be an fcp extension with msupp s r mi ni 1 in 23 the paragraph before proposition 2 21 we say that r s is a b extension if the map r s n i 1 rmi smi defined by t tmi n i 1 is bijective in this case is an order isomorphism an integral fcp extension is a b extension 4 theorem 3 6 if in addition r s has fip then r s n i 1 rmi smi if r s is a ring extension and p spec r then sp is both the localization sr p as a ring and the localization at p of the r module s we denote by r p the residual field rp prp at p if r s is a ring extension and q spec s there exists a residual field extension r q r s q moreover for p spec r the ring morphism p p rs sp psp is called the fiber morphism at p whose target is the fiber of the extension at p a ring extension r s is called an i extension if the natural map spec s spec r is injective finally x is the cardinality of a set x denotes proper inclusion and for a positive integer n we set nn 1 n the characteristic of an integral domain k is denoted by c k 1 3 results on minimal extensions 6 g picavet and m picavet definition 1 1 26 definition 2 1 an extension r s is called m crucial if msupp s r m such a maximal ideal m is called the crucial maximal ideal c r s of r s theorem 1 2 8 the ore me 2 2 a minimal extension is simple cru cial and is either integral finite or a flat epimorphism in 21 a minimal flat epimorphism is called a pru fer minimal ex tension an fcp pru fer extension has fip and is a tower of finitely many pru fer minimal extensions 21 proposition 1 3 three types of minimal integral extensions exist characterized in the next theorem a consequence of the fundamental lemma of ferrand olivier whence four types of minimal extensions exists and are mu tually exclusive theorem 1 3 4 theorems 2 2 and 2 3 let r t be an extension and m r t then r t is minimal and finite if and only if m max r and one of the following three conditions holds a inert case m max t and r m t m is a minimal field extension b decomposed case there exist m 1 m 2 max t such that m m 1 m 2 and the natural maps r m t m 1 and r m t m 2 are both isomorphisms or equivalently there exists q t r such that t r q and q 2 q m c ramified case there exists m max t such that m 2 m m t m r m 2 and the natural map r m t m is an isomorphism or equivalently there exists q t r such that t r q and q 2 m in each of the above cases m c r t 2 recall on closures involved in ring extensions 2 1 definitions the following definitions are needed for our study we first consider more or less classical concepts definition 2 1 an integral extension r s is called infra integral 18 resp subintegral 30 if all its residual extensions are isomor phisms resp and is an i extension we next consider some other concepts that will allow us to give an elementwise interpretation of the above definitions two of them are classical and the third was developed by the first author and does not seem well known but is essential in the sequel closures and co closures 7 definition 2 2 according to 15 definitions 1 1 1 2 and 1 5 propo sition 1 6 18 and 30 and setting pr x x 2 rx r x where r s is a ring extension r s is called s elementary resp t elementary u elementary if s r b where p 0 b bp 0 b r resp pr b bpr b r for some r r p 1 b bp 1 b r in the following the letter x denotes s t or u cx elementary if r s is a tower of finitely many x elementary extensions x integral if there exists a directed set si i i r s such that r si is cx elementary and s i isi in particular an s elementary resp u elementary extension is a t elementary extension in the same way a cs elementary resp cu elementary extension is a ct elementary extension and an s integral resp u integral extension is a t integral extension proposition 2 3 an s integral resp t integral extension is nothing but a subintegral 30 resp infra integral 18 extension definition 2 4 an extension r s is called s closed or seminor mal resp t closed u closed or anodal if an element b s is in r whenever p 0 b bp 0 b r resp pr b bpr b r for some r r p 1 b bp 1 b r let x s t u the x closure xsr of r in s is the smallest element b r s such that b s is x closed and the greatest element b r s such that r b is x integral it follows that usr tsr note that the s closure is actually the seminormalization sr of r in s and is the greatest subintegral extension of r in s note also that the t closure tsr is the greatest infra integral extension of r in s in some next subsections other closures will be defined the canonical decomposition of an arbitrary ring extension r s is r sr tsr r s one of our aims is to investigate when a dual decomposition exists proposition 2 5 an fcp pru fer extension is t closed proof let r s be an fcp pru fer extension since an fcp pru fer extension is a tower of finitely many pru fer minimal extensions let r 0 r ri rn s be a maximal chain so that each ri ri 1 is minimal pru fer for i 0 n 1 let b s such that b 2 rb b 3 rb 2 r rn 1 for some r r rn 1 then either b or b r is in rn 1 by 8 proposition 3 1 so that b rn 1 an easy induction shows that b r and r s is t closed 8 g picavet and m picavet 2 2 technical results needed in the sequel the next proposition describes the link between the elements of the canonical decomposition and minimal extensions proposition 2 6 22 proposition 4 5 let there be an integral exten sion r s and a maximal chain r r 0 ri rn s of subextensions each ri ri 1 being minimal the following state ments hold 1 r s is subintegral if and only if each ri ri 1 is ramified 2 r s is seminormal and infra integral if and only if each ri ri 1 is decomposed 3 r s is infra integral if and only if each ri ri 1 is either decomposed or ramified 4 r s is t closed if and only if each ri ri 1 is inert 5 r s is seminormal if and only if each ri ri 1 is either decomposed or inert if either 1 or 4 holds then spec s spec r is bijective lemma 2 7 4 corollary 3 2 if there exists a maximal chain r r 0 ri rn s of extensions such that each ri ri 1 is minimal then supp s r c ri ri 1 r i 0 n 1 we emphasize on the following useful result proposition 2 8 26 proposition 2 4 let r s be an integral fcp extension then r s is seminormal if and only if r s is an intersection of finitely many maximal ideals of s if this condition holds the intersection giving r s is irredundant in r and s proposition 2 9 let r s be an fcp integral extension with con ductor i then vr i has finitely many elements and is contained in max r so that vr i supp s r msupp s r moreover for each q spec s such that r q dr i the residual extension q r q is an isomorphism proof since r s is an integral fcp extension r i is an artinian ring 4 theorem 4 2 and the extension is finite so that vr i supp s r msupp s r where the last equation is valid because r i is artinian let q spec s such that p r q d i since p 6 supp s r we have thatrp sp sq whence q r q closures and co closures 9 lemma 2 10 let r s be an fcp integral t closed extension then for each m msupp s r there exists a unique n max s ly ing above m moreover rm sm msn nsn and n sn rm sm we denote by this last statement for a later use proof let m msupp s r since r s is an fcp t closed ex tension so is rm sm and rm sm mrm max sm by 4 proposition 4 10 so that mrm msm moreover there exists a unique n max s lying above m by proposition 2 6 and sm sn according to 2 proposition 2 page 40 these facts combine to yield that i rm sm msn nsn in particular m rm i and n sn nsn sn i 3 co integral closures let r s be an almost pru fer fcp extension since r is the least t r s such that t s is integral 21 proposition 4 17 we can ask if for any fcp extension r s there exists a least t r s such that t s is integral the answer is yes as we are going to show but this statement may not hold for any arbitrary ring extension to see this we will use for instance 7 example 2 1 where the following situation holds let p be a prime number k a field with c k p and n a prime number such that n p let x be an indeterminate over k and set k k x f k xn and l xn xp then we get that k f l k fl is not algebraic and then not integral while f k and l k are minimal field extensions and then integral actually intersecting two minimal integral extension whose targets are s is a first test for the validity of the result we have in view proposition 3 1 let r s be an fcp extension and t u r s be such that t s and u s are minimal integral extensions with t 6 u then t u s is integral with t u 6 t u proof set v t u m t s and n u s assume first that m 6 n then v s is integral according to 7 proposition 6 6 since so are v t and v u assume now that m n it follows by 7 proposition 5 7 that m max v but we also have m max t and m max u with m v s it follows that v m t m and v m u m are fcp field extensions and then integral by 4 theorem 4 2 since any minimal subextension of v m t m and v m u m is inert by theorem 1 3 hence v m s m is an integral extension and so is v s obviously t u 6 t u since t 6 u 10 g picavet and m picavet to get the general result the following lemmata are needed lemma 3 2 let r s be an fcp extension and t u r s such that t s is integral and u s is minimal integral with u 6 t s then there exists w t u t such that w t is minimal integral proof let ti ni 0 r s be a maximal chain such that t 0 s and tn t so that each ti 1 ti is minimal integral for each i nn set vi ti u giving v vn t u obviously we have vi 1 ti 1 vi we intend to build by induction on i nn a set wi ni 1 v s such that wi vi ti with wi ti minimal integral for each i nn our induction hypothesis is the following for i nn there exists wi vi ti with wi ti minimal integral and either wi 6 ti 1 or wi ti 1 6 vi when i n for i 1 since t 1 s and u s are minimal integral we know by proposition 3 1 that v 1 t 1 is an integral fcp extension of course v 1 6 t 1 because t 1 6 u in particular there exists w 1 v 1 t 1 with w 1 t 1 minimal integral assume that w 1 t 2 leading to v 2 t 2 u w 1 u v 1 u v 1 so that v 2 v 1 if t 2 v 1 then t t 2 u leads to a contradiction it follows that t 2 6 v 1 assume that the induction hypothesis holds for some i nn 1 so that wi ti is minimal integral for somewi vi ti such that either wi 6 ti 1 or wi ti 1 6 vi first assume that wi 6 ti 1 and set w i 1 ti 1 wi we claim that w i 1 6 ti 1 otherwise ti 1 wi which leads to ti 1 wi a contradiction then w i 1 ti 1 is integral by proposition 3 1 and there exists wi 1 w i 1 ti 1 such that wi 1 ti 1 is mini mal integral if i n 1 we are done if i n 1 assume that wi 1 ti 2 then vi 2 ti 2 u wi 1 u vi 1 u vi 1 so that vi 2 vi 1 if ti 2 vi 1 then t ti 2 u leads to a contradiction it follows that ti 2 6 vi 1 then the induction hy pothesis holds we therefore have the following commutative diagram vi wi ti vi 1 w i 1 wi 1 ti 1 now assume that wi ti 1 vi it follows that vi wi u ti 1 u vi 1 vi which gives vi 1 vi and vi 1 ti 1 then there exists wi 1 vi 1 ti 1 such that wi 1 ti 1 is min imal integral if i n 1 we are done if i n 2 assume that wi 1 ti 2 vi 1 then t ti 2 u leads to a contra diction it follows that ti 2 6 vi 1 then the induction hypothesis holds for i 1 and then for any i nn in particular there exists closures and co closures 11 wn vn tn ti ni 0 such that wn tn is minimal integral that is there exists w t u t such that w t is minimal integral lemma 3 3 let r s be an fcp extension and t u r s such that t s is integral and u s is minimal integral with u 6 t s then t u s is an integral extension proof set v t u we are going to show by induction that there exists a maximal finite chain wj mj 0 such that w 0 t and wm v where wj 1 wj is minimal integral our induction hypothesis is the following for k 0 m 1 where m is some positive integer such that m t u t there exists a maximal finite chain wj kj 0 v t such that w 0 t and wj 1 wj is minimal integral for any j 0 k the induction hypothesis holds for k 0 by lemma 3 2 assume that the induction hypothesis holds for some k 0 m 1 set t wk v t so that t s is an integral extension moreover v t u t u v so that t u v if u t s then t u t v and v s is integral assume now that u 6 t s we apply lemma 3 2 to the extensions t s which is integral and u s which is minimal integral then there exists wk 1 v t v t such that wk 1 t wk is minimal integral it follows that the induction hypothesis holds for k 1 and we have a decreasing maximal chain in v t which stops at some wm v since r s has fcp in particular v t is an integral extension and so is v s proposition 3 4 let r s be an fcp extension and t u r s such that t s and u s are integral then t u s is integral proof set v t u if v t u we have the result now assume that v 6 t u let ui ni 0 be a maximal chain such that u 0 s and un u then ui 1 ui is minimal integral for each i 0 n set vi t ui for each i 0 n we are going to prove by induction on i that vi s is integral for any i 0 n the induction hypothesis holds obviously for i 0 and is lemma 3 3 for i 1 if u 1 6 t s if u 1 t s then v 1 t so that v 1 s is integral assume that the induction hypothesis holds for some i 0 n 1 that is vi s is integral we have vi 1 t ui 1 t ui ui 1 vi ui 1 since vi s is integral so is vi ui moreover ui 1 ui is minimal integral using again lemma 3 3 for the extensions vi ui and ui 1 ui if ui 1 6 vi ui we get that vi 1 vi is integral and so is vi 1 s if ui 1 vi ui then vi 1 ui 1 vi vi and then the result also holds the induction 12 g picavet and m picavet hypothesis holds for i 1 and then for any i 0 n and in particular for i n so that v s is integral the previous results combine to yield that for an fcp extension r s we can introduce a new closure namely the co integral closure as it is shown in the following theorem theorem 3 5 let r s be an fcp extension there exists a least t r s such that t s is integral we call such t the co integral closure of r s and denote it by r moreover r u r s u s integral and r r proof set e t r s t s integral then s e and since r s is an artinian lattice e admits a minimal element we claim that this minimal element is unique indeed assume that there exist t u two distinct minimal elements of e so that t 6 u where t s and u s are integral extensions then t u s is integral according to proposition 3 4 a contradiction with the minimality of t it follows that the minimal element of e that we denote r is the least t r s such that t s is integral in particular r u r s u s integral and any t r s is such that t s is integral now we show that r r let v be the integral closure of r in r and set w r v we have the following commutative diagram r w r v s r v r since r v is integral so is r w and r w is almost pru fer according to 21 proposition 4 16 rp wp is either integral or pru fer for each p spec r in case we get rp r p so that vp wp in case we get rp vp so that r p wp leading to vp wp is pru fer then v w is pru fer as is v r and so is v wr by 11 corollary 5 11 page 53 since v r wr holds we deduce that r wr is pru fer but wr r s implies that r wr is integral giving r wr to end r w wr r corollary 3 6 let r s be an fcp extension let t be the co integral closure of r s and u be the integral closure of r in t then u s is almost pru fer and t is the pru fer hull of u s proof since u t is pru fer and t s is integral we get that u s is almost pru fer and t is the pru fer hull of u s closures and co closures 13 theorem 3 7 let r s be an fcp extension then r s is almost pru fer if and only if r r proof assume that r r then r r is pru fer and r r s is integral so that r s is almost pru fer conversely assume that r s is almost pru fer according to 21 proposition 4 17 r is the least t r s such that t s is integral which implies that r r the previous theorem shows that for an fcp extension r s which is not almost pru fer then r r in particular r r is not pru fer and then not integrally closed because an integrally closed fcp extension is pru fer this situation holds in example 3 9 if r s is an almost pru fer extension the closures r and r are linked as we can see in the following proposition which improves 26 theorem 6 13 since r r proposition 3 8 if r s is an almost pru fer fcp extension there are order isomorphisms 1 r r r s defined by t tr for any t r r and whose inverse r s r r is defined by u u r for any u r s 2 r r r s defined by t tr for any t r r and whose inverse r s r r is defined by u u r for any u r s 3 r s r r r r defined by w w r w r for any w r s and whose inverse r r r r r s is defined by w w ww for any w w r r r r proof since r s is an almost pru fer fcp extension 26 propo sition 4 3 says that r s splits at r and r with r r o and theorem 3 7 asserts that r r 1 according to 26 theorem 6 13 4 the map r r r s is an order isomorphism moreover r s r r defined by u u r clearly exists and preserves order let t r r and u r s then t r r r r and s r r ur it follows that t tr r t and u u r r u a consequence of 21 proposition 4 21 then is an order isomorphism such that 1 2 similarly r r r s is an order isomorphism by 26 theorem 6 13 3 and r s r r defined by u u r 14 g picavet and m picavet exists and preserves order let t r r and u r s then t r r r r and s r r ur it follows that u u r r u a consequence of 21 proposition 4 21 now 21 corollary 4 3 implies that t tr r t then is an order isomorphism such that 1 3 according to 26 theorem 6 13 5 r r r r r s defined by w w ww for any w w r r r r is an order isomorphism and so is obviously r r r r r s defined by w w ww for any w w r r r r moreover the map r s r r r r defined by w w r w r for any w r s exists and preserves order let w r s then u w w r w r tak ing into account 21 proposition 4 18 and localizing at any m msupp s r msupp r r msupp r r with msupp r r msupp r r we get the following if m msupp r r then rm r m and sm r m so that um wm if m msupp r r then rm r m and sm r m so that um wm it follows that u w and w w for any w r s then is the identity on r s since is an order isomorphism so is 1 in the context of algebraic orders we built an fip extension r k which is not almost pru fer 26 example 6 15 but where we exhibit its almost pru fer closure as the co integral closure was not still defined we recall this example here and show that k is the co integral closure of the extension example 3 9 26 example 6 15 let k be an algebraic number field t be its ring of algebraic integers and r be an algebraic order of k such that r t is a minimal inert extension set m r t max r so that m max t let n max r m 6 n set r m n which is a multiplicatively closed subset then r r is a semilocal ring with two maximal ideals m m and n n moreover t t is also a semilocal ring with two maximal ideals and such that r t is a minimal inert extension with m m r t max t the other maximal ideal of t is p nt in particular t is a pru fer domain with quotient field k t tm is mini mal pru fer with p c t tm and n msuppr tm t moreover t is the integral closure of r k and r k is an fcp extension there is a commutative diagram with r k r t rm tm tp k closures and co closures 15 rm r tm k t tp where r tm is almost pru fer with rm tm minimal inert as r t and r rm is pru fer minimal as t tm tm k t tp and tp k when considering the extension r k obviously there does not exist some v r k such that v k is integral which implies that k is the co integral closure of r k and rm is the pru fer hull of r k and also of r tm then as it is said after theorem 3 7 the co integral closure and the pru fer hull do not always coincide but in the present example as r tm is almost pru fer rm is also the co integral closure of r tm example 3 10 let r s be an extension each t r s such that t s is integrally closed contains r dually things are not so simple for an extension r s we set r s ic t r s t r r i e t r s ic if and only if r t is integrally closed in particular r r s ic clearly r belongs to r s ic and this set is inductive in the poset r s by zorn lemma it contains maximal elements it also contains t r s such that t r is a mcs by 29 the ore me 1 d let m be a maximal element of r s ic and s s m then m m s cannot be integrally closed because otherwise r m s would be integrally closed it follows that there is some p s m s m which is integral over m and then s is algebraic over m therefore s is algebraic over m if we choose some maximal m containing r we get a tower r r m s where the last extension is algebraic in particular for each s s there is some m m such that ms is integral over m there exist some extensions r s such that r s ic has a greatest element for example if the extension is chained other examples are quasi pru fer extensions like fcp extensions because such extensions are integrally closed if and only if they are pru fer and subextensions of quasi pru fer extensions are quasi pru fer 21 corollary 3 3 in this case the greatest element of r s ic is r actually r s is quasi pru fer whence a p extension that is each element s s is a zero of a polynomial p x over r whose content is r in particular s is algebraic over r 16 g picavet and m picavet another example is given by completely distributive extensions r s extensions such that for each v r s and for any family wi i i of elements of r s we have i i wi v i i wi v the greatest element of r s ic is the product of all elements of r s ic denote by ti i i the elements of r s ic by u their product and let t be one of them then it is enough to show that u is integrally closed over r because t u but we have u r i i ti r r which proves that u is integrally closed over r note that the same proof holds if r s is distributive and has fcp whence has fip by 23 lemma 2 10 if r s ic t 1 tn we thus get that r t 1 tn we can also consider for an extension r s the set of all t r s such that r t is seminormal resp t closed u closed an element t r s is such that r t is seminormal resp t closed u closed if and only if sr t r resp tsr t usr t r then most of the preceding considerations hold 4 radicial and separable ring extensions we first introduce some notation if is a property of field exten sions we say that a ring extension is a extension if all its residual field extensions verify in the sequel of the section we will consider the separable and radicial properties where in this paper a purely in separable field extension is called radicial example 4 1 an fcp t closed extension r s is catenarian if and only if r s is catenarian indeed according to 25 proposi tion 4 3 r s is catenarian if and only if rm sm is catenar ian for each m msupp s r since r s is an fcp t closed extension we infer from property of lemma 2 10 that for each m msupp s r there exists a unique n max s lying above m moreover rm sm mrm nsn nsm and n sn rm sm set i rm sm in particular m rm i and n sn i then 25 corollary 3 7 shows that rm sm is catenarian for each m msupp s r rm i sm i is cate narian for each m msupp s r m n is catenarian for each m msupp s r n r n is catenarian for each n max s because of the bijection spec s spec r r s is catenarian kubota introduced the radicial closure of a ring extension focussing his results on integral ring extensions 12 later on manaresi reintro duced this notion and named it weak normalization 14 we keep the closures and co closures 17 notation of manaresi but not her terminology for a ring extension r s that we will suppose integral for the rest of the section we denote by sr the radicial closure of r in s we recall from 14 or 12 that sr x s x 1 1 x nil s r s moreover sr is the greatest subextension r t of r s such that r t is a radicial extension that is the ring morphism r t is univer sally an i morphism or equivalently an i morphism which is radicial 9 definition 3 7 2 p 248 and 12 proposition 1 for instance a subintegral extension is radicial yanagihara proved that a ring extension r s is radicial if and only if s is the filtered union of all u r s such that r u is a finite tower of finitely many subextensions of the type t t x with x s and t r s such that either xp t and px t for some prime integer p or x 2 x 3 t 31 theorem 2 let r s be an integral ring extension in 27 the second author says that r s is weakly infra integral if it is radicial she defined the strong t closure that is here termed the radicial closure of a ring extension r s as the greatest subalgebra v sr r s such that r v is radicial 27 definition 3 1 in particular rs sr let f r s be a ring morphism and its co diagonal ring mor phism f s r s s denote by i the kernel of the surjective ring morphism f if f is of finite type as an algebra then i is an ideal of finite type and i i 2 if and only if i is generated by an idempo tent we recall that a ring morphism f r s is called formally unramified if r s i i 2 the s module of differentials of f is zero and unramified if it is formally unramified and of finite type we see that a ring morphism of finite type f r s is unramified if and only if i is generated by an idempotent in this case f is called sep arable by some authors because f defines s as an s r s projective module 28 proposition 9 p 32 chapitre iii we will not use this terminology but in this paper we will say that an integral extension r s is separable if its residual extensions are separable in which case r u and u s are separable for any u r s to check that an integral fcp extension r s with conductor i is separable it is enough to verify that the extensions q r q are sepa rable for each maximal ideal q vs i by proposition 2 9 note that r u is separable for any u r tsr note also that a radicial and separable extension is infra integral the following proposition belongs to the algebraic geometry folklore but we can not give any reference so we give an outline of its proof 18 g picavet and m picavet proposition 4 2 a finite type extension r s is a ring epimorphism if and only if it is radicial and unramified therefore an integral fcp extension is trivial when it is radicial and unramified proof one implication is clear because an epimorphism is an i extension and the residual extensions are isomorphisms 13 proposition 1 5 page 109 now if r s is radicial and unramified then the kernel of s r s s is generated by an idempotent which is nilpotent therefore is an isomorphism and the extension is an epimorphism 13 proposition 1 5 p 109 the last assertion is a consequence of the following facts each subextension of an integral fcp extension is module finite and a module finite ring epimorphism is surjective 13 proposition 1 7 p 111 we have the following results that may not hold if the extension is not fcp proposition 4 3 let r s be an integral fcp extension the following statements are equivalent 1 the extension is unramified 2 for all q spec s the ring morphism rr q sq is formally unramified 3 qsq psq and p q is a finite separable field exten sion for each q spec s and p q r 4 the extension is separable and for each q spec s and p q r the ideal psp of sp is semiprime 5 p p r s is unramified for each p spec r it follows that an unramified extension is universally separable proof 1 2 is 10 exercise 1 14 vi to prove that 1 4 we use 28 exercise 1 p 38 which states that a ring morphism of finite type r s is unramified if and only if qsq psq and p q is a finite separable field extension for each q spec s and p q r which proves 1 3 we next prove that 3 4 suppose that the extension is unramified we can assume that r is local with maximal ideal p then r p s ps is e tale over the field r p it follows that s ps is reduced and ps is semiprime by 28 proposition 1 page 74 to prove the converse if ps is semiprime we observe that ps is the intersection of the finitely many maximal ideals of s lying over p because r s is finite it is now easy to show that psq qsq now 1 5 because of 10 property 2 2 vi page 8 and the fact that the unramified property is stable under any base change closures and co closures 19 corollary 4 4 let r s be an integral fcp t closed extension then r s is unramified if and only if r s is separable proof according to proposition 4 3 r s is unramified if and only if qsq psq and p q is a finite separable field extension for each q spec s and p q r but the condition of lemma 2 10 shows that qsq psq for each q spec s and p q r then r s is unramified p q is a finite separable field extension for each q spec s and p q r r s is separable the following facts are known if r s t is an unramified tower of extension then t s is unramified and a tower of unramified extensions is unramified but r s does not need to be unramified except if r is a field 10 lemme 3 4 p 11 however we can provide the following result that can be used on a tower of finitely many minimal extensions the last one being pure recall that a ring morphism f r s is called pure if r r rs is injective for each ring morphism r r or equivalently m m r s is injective for each r module m if f is pure then f 1 is i for each ideal i of r so that f is injective moreover a pure ring morphism r s verifies the condition o i e an r module m is zero if m r s 0 proposition 4 5 let r s t be an unramified fcp extension such that s t is pure then r s is unramified proof consider a prime ideal p of r and the fiber morphism p p r s p r t the last morphism is injective because deduced from the pure morphism s t by the base change s p r s now it is enough to use proposition 4 3 5 because over a field a subextension of an unramified extension is unramified 10 lemma 3 4 p 11 the next result gives a necessary and sufficient condition in order that the above result holds proposition 4 6 let r s be an integral seminormal fcp extension and t r s then r s is unramified if and only if r t and t s are unramified proof we need only to prove that if r s is unramified then so is r t indeed the unramified property is stable under composition and stable under left division without any other hypothesis by 10 properties 2 2 ii and 2 2 v p 8 let q spec t p q r and let m spec s be lying over q so that p r m since 20 g picavet and m picavet p m is a separable field extension so is p q then according to proposition 4 3 to show that r t is unramified it is enough to show that ptp is semiprime in tp that is an intersection of prime ideals of tp but rp tp is still a seminormal fcp integral extension with rp a local ring it follows that we may assume that r p is a local ring and we have to show that pt is semiprime in t set c r t which is an intersection of maximal ideals of t and r according to proposition 2 8 so that c p to conclude r t is unramified by 16 lemma 2 2 if i is the conductor ideal of an extension r s then r s is unramified if and only if r i s i is unramified it follows that an inert minimal extension r s with conductor m is unramified if and only if the field extension r m s m is separable in which case the extension r s is called separable inert remark 4 7 1 in the previous proposition the condition that r s is seminormal is necessary indeed assume that r s is an integral fcp extension which is not seminormal then r 6 sr and there exists t r sr such that r t is minimal ramified it follows that p r t max r let q max t be the unique because of theorem 1 3 maximal ideal of t lying above p and letm max s be lying above p and then above q even if r s is unramified so that p m is separable by proposition 4 3 and then p q is separable r t is not unramified indeed rp tp is still minimal ramified with prp ptp ptq qtp qtq because tp tq by 2 proposition 2 page 40 2 the situation of 1 occurs in the following example let r m be a spir such that m 2 0 set s r 2 and t sr r m m by 20 proposition 2 8 then r t is minimal ramified and t s is minimal decomposed because max s r m m r so that r s is infra integral with residual extensions which are isomorphisms and then separable to show that r s is unramified using proposition 4 3 4 it is enough to show that ms is semiprime in s which is obvious since ms m m m r r m then r s is unramified although r t is not 3 but there exist unramified extensions r u that cannot be seminormal with t s r u such that r s s u t u are unramified and r t is not unramified we keep the hypotheses of the preceding example let r v be a minimal inert separable extension and set m rt it is always possible to build such an extension it is enough to choose the spir r m such that k r m has a minimal separable field extension closures and co closures 21 k k x k x f x and to set v r x tx g x where f x g x k x is the monic polynomial whose coefficients are the classes of coefficients of g x then r v is minimal inert separable now set u v r according to 3 proposition iii 4 s u is also minimal inert separable with s u m r giving the type of the minimal extension so that r u is unramified as the composite of two unramified extensions r s and s u however we still have r t not unramified and t u unramified since so are t s and s u looking at the preceding example we may ask under what con ditions an unramified extension is a tower of only unramified minimal extensions we begin by characterizing minimal unramified extensions proposition 4 8 let r s be a minimal extension then r s is unramified if and only if r s is either decomposed or separable inert or minimal pru fer proof we first observe that a ramified minimal extension r s with conductor m a maximal ideal is luckily not unramified otherwise r m r m x x 2 would be e tale and then r m x x 2 reduced now a decomposed extension is modulo its conductor ideal of the form k k k where k is a field whence is unramified a minimal inert separable extension is unramified as we said before remark 4 7 at last a minimal pru fer extension is unramified because it is an epimorphism by proposition 4 2 proposition 4 9 let r s be an fcp integral extension the following statements are equivalent 1 r s is a seminormal separable extension 2 r s is a tower of finitely many decomposed minimal exten sions and inert separable extensions if these conditions hold then r s is unramified proof r s is a seminormal extension if and only if r s is a tower of decomposed minimal extensions and inert extensions by proposition 2 6 which proves a part of the equivalence assume that the previous conditions hold let r 0 r ri rn s be a maximal chain where ri ri 1 is minimal for each i 0 n 1 let q spec s set p q r and pi q ri for each i 0 n 1 so that pi pi 1 ri then ri pi ri 1 pi 1 is either an isomorphism or a minimal field 22 g picavet and m picavet extension in this last case ri pi ri 1 pi 1 is either radicial or separable it follows that r p s q is separable if and only if ri pi ri 1 pi 1 is either an isomorphism or a minimal separable field extension for each i 0 n 1 if and only if ri ri 1 is either a decomposed minimal extension or an inert separable minimal extension for each i 0 n 1 the last result comes from propositions 4 8 and 4 6 we will define the unramified closure of an fcp integral extension in section 6 we are now going to show the existence of the separable closure of an fcp integral ring extension r s as the greatest subal gebra v sr r s such that r v is separable remark 4 10 contrary to the unramified context we can note that the separable and radicial properties verify due to field theory and without any additional hypotheses the following statement let r s t be a tower of integral fcp ring extensions then r t has the separable or the radicial property if and only if so do r s and s t lemma 4 11 if r s is an integral fcp t closed extension there exists a greatest subalgebra v sr r s such that r v is separable proof we begin to assume that r m is a local ring and so is s m by 4 proposition 4 10 since m r s there is an order preserv ing bijection r s r m s m defined by t 7 t m according to 3 lemma ii 3 but r m s m is an algebraic field extension and admits a separable closure w which is the greatest subextension of r m s m such that r m w is a separable algebraic field ex tension then the previous bijection shows that there exists a greatest subalgebra v sr r s such that r v is separable assume now that r s is an arbitrary integral fcp t closed ex tension and set msupp s r m 1 mn define r s n i 1 rmi smi by t tm 1 tmn by 4 theorem 3 6 is a bijection let mi msupp s r then rmi smi is an in tegral fcp t closed extension where rmi mirmi a local ring the first part of the proof shows that there exists a greatest subalgebra vi rmi smi such that rmi vi is separable let v be the unique element of r s such that vmi vi for each i nn moreover r s is an i extension being t closed by proposition 2 6 let ni be the unique maximal ideal of s lying above mi so that smi sni then mi r mi rmi mirmi and ni s ni smi mirmi because mirmi rmi smi for each i nn set pi ni v closures and co closures 23 max v then we have the fields extensions mi pi ni with pi v pi the greatest subalgebra of mi ni such that mi pi is separable then there exists a separable closure v of r s theorem 4 12 an integral fcp extension r s admits a greatest subalgebra v sr r s such that r v is separable moreover any subextension u of s is separable over r if and only if u r v and any z v s is such that z s is radicial proof let t tsr be the t closure of r s since t s is t closed it admits a separable closure v by the previous lemma let p max r q max v lying over p and n q t which is also lying over p then p n because r t is infra integral and n q is separable by definition of v it follows that p q is separable and r v is separable obviously any subextension of v is separable over r let z v s and let m max z be lying above q which is also lying over p then q m is radicial by definition of q so that z s is radicial let u r s be such that r u is separable if u t s then t u is separable so that u v assume that u 6 t s we claim that u r v set w u t t which is the t closure of r u we have the following commutative diagram r w u t tu s since w t is infra integral there exists a directed set wi i i ofw subalgebras of t such that w wi is ct elementary and t i iwi by 15 definition 1 2 it obviously follows that there exists a directed set ui i i of u subalgebras of tu such that u ui is ct elementary and tu i iui indeed if a b is a t elementary subexten sion of w t ua ub is a t elementary subextension of u tu therefore u tu is infra integral and then separable by an above remark hence r ut is separable and so is t ut so that u ut v and u r v corollary 4 13 let r s be an integral fcp extension then sr s is radicial and tsr sr sr proof set t tsr v sr and u sr let q max s p q t and m q r p r since r t is infra integral we have m p but we also have v st by the proof of theorem 4 12 hence n q v is the unique maximal ideal of v lying over 24 g picavet and m picavet p moreover vp ptp n is the separable closure of the field extension p q as a consequence of the construction made in lemma 4 11 so that n q is radicial at last spec s spec v is bijective since v s is t closed by proposition 2 6 whence v s is radicial in particular t u v since the residual extensions of r t are isomorphisms assume that t u v then the residual extensions of t u v are both radicial and separable fields extensions that is isomorphisms so that t u v is infra integral a contradiction to conclude t u v 5 u closures of integral fcp extensions in this section we work in the context of fcp integral extensions where many results of 15 about anodality will be easier to handle proposition 5 1 an integral fcp extension r s is u closed if and only if r i s i is u closed for any ideal i shared by r and s proof obvious the next result does not hold if r s is not fcp proposition 5 2 let r s be an integral fcp extension then the following conditions are equivalent 1 r s is u closed 2 r s is an i extension 3 sr t sr if these conditions are satisfied any minimal subextension of r s is either ramified or inert proof 1 2 set i r s proposition 5 1 shows that r i s i is u closed moreover r i is an artinian and so a noetherian ring by 4 theorem 4 2 then by 15 proposition 2 35 spec s i spec r i is bijective it follows that spec s spec r is bijective 2 1 assume that spec s spec r is bijective then 15 theorem 2 27 asserts that r s is u closed 2 3 sr 6 tsr implies that spec tsr spec sr is not bi jective according to theorem 1 3 since there is a minimal decomposed subextension of sr tsr 3 2 if sr tsr then spec s spec r is bijective since so are spec s spec tsr and spec sr spec r by proposition 2 6 the last assertion is an easy consequence of 3 corollary 5 3 a minimal extension r s is u closed if and only if r s is either ramified or inert or minimal pru fer closures and co closures 25 proof the equivalence in the integral case is a consequence of propo sition 5 2 since spec s spec r is bijective if and only if r s is either ramified or inert assume that r s is a minimal pru fer ex tension then r s is u closed since t closed by proposition 2 5 proposition 5 4 let r s be a u closed integral fcp extension then t u is u closed for any t u r s such that t u proof we use proposition 5 2 assume that spec u spec t is not bijective there exist n 1 n 2 max u n 1 6 n 2 such that n 1 t n 2 t in particular n 1 r n 2 r since r s is an fcp integral extension so are t u and u s in particular there exist m 1 m 2 max s such that n 1 m 1 u and n 2 m 2 u it follows that m 1 r m 2 r with m 1 6 m 2 since n 1 6 n 2 a contradiction with spec s spec r bijective then spec u spec t is bijective and t u is u closed by proposition 5 2 proposition 5 5 let r s be an integral fcp extension 1 usr m u sm rm for any m msupp s r 2 usr i u s i r i for any ideal i shared by r and s proof set u usr 1 letm msupp s r we first show that um sm is u closed using proposition 5 2 it is enough to show that spec sm spec um is bijective which is obvious since so is spec s spec u because u s is u closed then usmrm um now since r s is an integral fcp extension 4 theorem 3 6 shows that there exists u r s such that u m usmrm for any m msupp s r in particular u m sm is u closed for any m msupp s r therefore u s is u closed by 15 proposi tion 1 16 then u u which implies um u m usmrm for any m msupp s r so that um usr m usmrm for any m msupp s r by 2 let i be an ideal shared by r and s then i is also an ideal of u since u s is u closed so is u i s i by proposition 5 1 so that u s i r i u i but spec s i spec u s i r i is bijective with u s i r i r i s i it follows that there exists u r s such that u i u s i r i with u i u i giving u u moreover spec s i spec u i is bijective and so is spec s spec u at last proposition 5 2 shows that u s is u closed which implies u u and to conclude u u by that is u i u s i r i 26 g picavet and m picavet corollary 5 6 let r s be an integral fcp extension the following conditions are equivalent 1 r s is u closed resp u integral 2 rm sm is u closed resp u integral for anym msupp s r 3 r i s i is u closed resp u integral for any ideal i shared by r and s proof we use proposition 5 5 then usr m u sm rm for any m msupp s r and usr i u s i r i for any ideal i shared by r and s the different equivalences are obvious since r s is u closed resp u integral if and only if usr r resp u sr s with similar equalities for rm sm and r i s i we recall 15 definition 2 11 that a ring morphism f a b is said to be locally an epimorphism if af 1 q bq is an epimorphism for every q spec b the next result gives a characterization of u integral extensions in the fcp context by some property of ring morphisms as it is the case for subintegral and infra integral extensions in an arbitrary context this result may not hold theorem 5 7 an integral fcp extension r s is u integral if and only if r s is locally an epimorphism in which case r s is unramified proof assume first that r s is u integral then r s is locally an epimorphism by 15 corollary 2 23 conversely assume that r s is locally an epimorphism since usr s is u closed proposition 5 2 asserts that spec s spec usr is bijective moreover r s is a finite injective locally epimorphism according to 15 remark 2 34 1 r s is cu elementary and in particular u integral the last statement holds by proposition 4 3 2 and 10 exercise 1 14 p 7 the seminormalization the t closure and the u closure are linked as it is shown in the following theorem theorem 5 8 if r s is an integral fcp extension then usr sr t sr holds in particular such an extension is t closed if and only if it is seminormal and u closed anodal proof since spec s spec tsr is bijective proposition 5 2 shows that tsr s is u closed so that usr tsr we already know that sr tsr by definition 2 1 whence usr sr tsr holds closures and co closures 27 now usr usr sr and sr usr sr combine to yield that usr sr s is both seminormal and u closed and then locally u closed by corollary 5 6 hence usr sr s is t closed accord ing to 17 proposition 3 17 leading to tsr usr sr and then to usr sr t sr the last statement is 17 proposition 3 17 since u closedness is equivalent to local u closedness by corollary 5 6 theorem 5 9 let r s be an integral fcp extension the following conditions are equivalent 1 r s is u integral and seminormal 2 r s is seminormal infra integral 3 vs r s vr r s r s 4 sr r and t sr s 5 r s is an irredundant intersection of r s n maximal ideals of s and an intersection of n maximal ideals of r for some positive integer n if these conditions hold then n vr r s proof set n vr r s by proposition 2 9 1 2 since r s is u integral then r s is infra integral by definition 2 2 and proposition 2 3 2 1 since r s is infra integral we have s tsr and since r s is seminormal we have r sr then theorem 5 8 leads to u sr u sr r u sr sr t sr s so that r s is u integral 2 3 because of proposition 2 6 2 4 is obvious according to the definitions of sr and tsr 2 5 since r s is seminormal fcp r s mi 1 mi where mi max s for each i nm by proposition 2 8 so that m vs r s vr r s r s by 3 but we also have r s nj 1 pj where the pj s are the intersections of the mi s with r with perhaps more than one mi for one pj then m n r s giving 5 5 3 assume that r s mi 1 mi where mi max s for each i nm with m r s n and that r s nj 1 pj where the pj max r for each j nn then vs r s vr r s r s giving 3 the following proposition was proved in 15 theorem 4 8 in a dif ferent context proposition 5 10 15 theorem 4 8 a minimal extension r s is u integral if and only if r s is decomposed 28 g picavet and m picavet proof let r s be a minimal extension and set m c r s if r s is decomposed there exists q s such that s r q q 2 q m r and mq m so that q 3 q 2 r then r s is u integral conversely assume that r s is u integral by assumption r s is a minimal integral extension if r s is either minimal ramified or minimal inert then r s is an i extension so that r s is u closed which implies r s a contradiction then r s is decomposed remark 5 11 let r s be an integral fcp extension with sr tsr 6 r s according to proposition 2 6 a minimal subextension of r sr is ramified and a minimal subextension of sr s is either decomposed or inert similarly any minimal subextension of r tsr is either ramified or decomposed and any minimal subextension of tsr s is inert contrary to these cases we have seen in proposition 5 2 that any minimal subextension of an u closed extension is either ramified or inert but a minimal ramified extension can also be a subextension of an u integral extension as we can see in the following examples we have not the same behavior with the u closure where we may have two minimal extensions of the same type contained and containing the u closure let r s be an integral fcp extension with u closure u sr we can see in the following examples that there exists a minimal ramified subextension of r usr and a minimal ramified subextension of usr s 1 let r be an artinian non reduced ring then r r 2 is an fcp infra integral and not seminormal extension by 20 proposition 1 4 it follows that there exists u r r 2 such that r u is minimal ramified moreover r r 2 is u integral by 15 example 2 32 this example also shows that a subextension of an u integral extension is not necessarily u integral indeed r r 2 r is u closed since subintegral by proposition 5 2 2 we continue to work with the situation of 1 with r z 2 z t t 2 z 2 z t where t is the class of t in r then r is an artinian local non reduced ring let m rt be its maximal ideal it follows that r r 2 is u integral according to 20 proposition 2 8 r m m r 2 r with r r m m minimal ramified indeed setting e 1 1 0 we have r m m r te 1 with te 1 2 0 r andmte 1 rt 2 e 1 0 and r m m r 2 is minimal decomposed since max r 2 2 then r r 2 2 set s r r x where r x r x x 2 tx and x is the class ofx in r x x 2 tx since x 2 0 and mx rtx 0 we get that r r x is minimal ramified as r 2 s by 3 proposition iii 4 so that r s 3 we claim that closures and co closures 29 r 2 usr set u u sr then u 6 r since r s is infra integral and not subintegral because max r 2 2 for a similar reason u 6 s because r 2 s is subintegral then r u r 2 s which implies that r u 1 2 if r u 2 then u r 2 and we are done assume that r u 1 so that r u is minimal necessarily decomposed since u integral and u r 2 is minimal ram ified considering the extension r r 2 and using 6 lemma 17 we get that mr 2 m m is not a radical ideal of r 2 a contradic tion then r u 2 and u r 2 usr this example exhibits a subintegral minimal ramified subextension r r 2 r of r usr r 2 as well as a subintegral minimal ramified subextension usr s of it self usr s as we can see in the following commutative diagram sr r r 2 r s u sr r 2 in the preceding remark we can observe that r sr usr r 2 r it may be asked under what conditions r sr usr holds for an fcp extension r s the answer is given in the following proposition proposition 5 12 let r s be an fcp extension then r sr usr if and only if r usr is seminormal proof set u usr then t sr u ur it follows that t r if and only if r ur if and only if r u is seminormal the closure of a ring extension r s is the greatest element u sr of r s such that r u is unramified 15 proposition 3 3 proposition 5 13 let r s be an fcp integral extension there exists a greatest unramified subextension r sr of r s then sr s is u closed so that usr sr sr proof for the first part use 15 proposition 3 3 taking into account that all subextensions of an fcp extension are of finite type to show that sr s is u closed consider some s s such that s 2 s s 3 s 2 sr then sr sr s is u integral whence unramified according to theorem 5 7 and so is r sr s by maximality of the unramified closure s belongs to sr since sr s is u closed usr sr now sr sr holds by proposition 4 3 since r sr is unramified corollary 5 14 let r s be a radicial fcp extension for in stance infra integral there exists some r s such that r is unramified s is radicial and sr usr 30 g picavet and m picavet proof it is enough to observe that the extension usr sr is unramified because so isr sr and radicial because radicial and an i extension by proposition 5 2 moreover a radicial unramified fcp extension is trivial by proposition 4 2 then set sr u sr remark 5 15 theorem 4 12 shows that for an integral fcp exten sion r s the extension r sr is separable and sr s is radicial the following example shows that we cannot generalize the above corollary to arbitrary integral extensions which means that we cannot replace the separable property by the unramified property we use 22 example 4 10 to get such a situation let k l be a minimal separable field extension of degree 2 so that there exists y l such that l k y set s l x x 2 and let x be the class of x in s set r k kx and t k lx so that r is a local ring with maximal ideal m kx and t is a local ring with maximal ideal m m rxy it was proved in 22 example 4 10 that r t is minimal ramified t s is minimal inert with m t s and t m s m is a minimal separable field extension with r s 3 moreover r t is radicial because an i extension with residual extensions which are isomorphisms and t s is unramified by proposition 4 3 since r s 3 there does not exist r s such that r is unramified and s is radicial 6 co subintegral closure and co infra integral closure of an integral fcp extension definition 2 4 recalls the definitions of several closures let r s be a ring extension as we did in section 3 with the co integral closure we are going to characterize some closures defined as the least t r s such that t s satisfies a given property let r s be an integral fcp extension in 6 lemma 17 we give a condition under which there exists t r s such that t s is minimal ramified a more general requirement is as follows let r s be an fcp extension there exists some u r s which is the least v r s such that v s is a subintegral extension if such a ring u exists we call it the co subintegral closure of r s and denote it by s r since it is a kind of dual of the seminormalization which is nothing but the subintegral closure sr and the largest v r s such that r v is subintegral similarly we can ask if there exists some u r s which is the least v r s such that v s is an infra integral extension if this u exists we call it the co infra integral closure of r s and denote it by closures and co closures 31 str since it is a kind of dual of the t closure t sr the largest v r s such that r v is infra integral many of the proofs of this section are similar for the subintegral case and the infra integral case if these co subintegral closure or co infra integral closures exist we have r str s r s with r s an integral fcp extension that is the reason why we limit ourselves to consider only integral fcp extensions proposition 6 1 let r s be an integral fcp extension the co subintegral resp co infra integral closure exists in the following cases 1 r s is subintegral resp infra integral then r s r resp str 2 r s is seminormal resp t closed then s s r resp str and u sr t sr proof obvious corollary 6 2 let r s be an integral fcp extension then r sr r sr t r t sr t r proof since r sr resp tsr is subintegral resp infra integral whence infra integral proposition 6 1 gives the answer in both cases the following remark shows that such closures do not always exist remark 6 3 let k k be a minimal radicial field extension of degree 2 so that c k c k 2 let k be such that k k with a 2 k set s k x x 2 k x k kx where x is the class of x in s then k s is a minimal ramified extension and then subintegral and infra integral with x 2 0 set x s and l k s it follows that 2 2 a k so that k l is a minimal radicial field extension with l k t t 2 a k of course k 6 l and s l x l lx with l s a minimal ramified extension and then subintegral and infra integral as k l k the extension k s has neither a co subintegral closure nor a co infra integral closure since there is no t k s such that t s is subintegral resp infra integral with t k l proposition 6 4 let r s be an integral fcp extension 1 if the co subintegral resp co infra integral closure t of r s exists then tm is the co subintegral resp co infra integral closure of rm sm for any m msupp s r 32 g picavet and m picavet 2 assume that for any m msupp s r there exists a co subintegral resp co infra integral closure t m of rm sm then the co subintegral closure resp co infra integral t of r s exists and satisfies tm t m for anym msupp s r proof 1 assume that the co subintegral resp co infra integral clo sure t of r s exists so that t is the least u r s such that u s is subintegral resp infra integral then tm sm is subintegral resp infra integral for any m msupp s r by 30 corollary 2 10 resp 17 proposition 1 16 let v rm sm be such that v sm is subintegral resp infra integral for some m msupp s r since r s is an integral fcp extension there exists w r s such that wm v and wm sm for any m msupp s r m by 4 theorem 3 6 then again by 30 proposition 2 9 resp 17 proposition 3 6 we get that w s is subintegral resp infra integral so that t w which leads to tm wm v then tm is the least u rm sm such that u sm is subintegral resp infra integral which means that tm is the co subintegral resp co infra integral closure of rm sm 2 conversely assume that for any m msupp s r there ex ists a co subintegral resp co infra integral closure t m of rm sm so that t m sm is subintegral resp infra integral for any m msupp s r we deduce from the above reference 4 theo rem 3 6 that there exists t r s such that tm t m for any m msupp s r so that tm sm is subintegral resp infra integral for any m msupp s r giving that t s is subintegral resp infra integral by 30 proposition 2 9 resp 17 proposition 3 6 now let v r s be such that v s is subintegral resp infra integral then vm sm is subintegral resp infra integral for any m msupp s r it follows that tm t m vm for any m msupp s r to end t v shows that t is the co subintegral resp co infra integral closure of r s let r s be an fcp extension we recall that r is called un branched in s if r is local in which case all rings in r s are local by 24 lemma 3 29 we also say that r s is unbranched a lo cally unbranched extension is an extension r s such that rp sp is unbranched for each p spec r a locally unbranched integral extension is nothing but an integral i extension proposition 6 5 if r s is an integral locally unbranched fcp extension such that the co subintegral closure exists then s r s t r closures and co closures 33 proof since r s is locally unbranched so is str s r so that str s is subintegral and then str s r theorem 6 6 an infra integral fcp extension r s has a co subintegral closure and usr s r proof since r s is infra integral usr s is infra integral and u closed and then an i extension by proposition 5 2 so that usr s is subintegral in particular usr is the least element t r s such that t s is subintegral since the least element t r s such that t s is an i extension then usr s r corollary 6 7 if r s is integral and fcp then tsr r usr proof set t tsr r which exists by theorem 6 6 and u u sr since t tsr is subintegral it is an i extension and so is tsr s since t closed then t s is an i extension and then u closed by proposition 5 2 so that u t tsr therefore u t is infra integral and an i extension whence subintegral so that u t corollary 6 8 let r s be an integral fcp extension whose co infra integral closure exists then the co subintegral closure of r s exists and s r s st r proof set t str then t s is infra integral and admits a co subintegral closure u s t according to theorem 6 6 let v r s be such that v s is subintegral whence infra integral it follows that u s t v then u is also the co subintegral closure of r s proposition 6 9 an integral fcp extension r s which has a co subintegral closure distinct from s is not unramified proof assume that r s is unramified and admits a co subintegral closure distinct from s then there exists t r s such that t s is minimal ramified hence not unramified a contradiction proposition 6 10 let r s be an integral fcp extension 1 assume that the co infra integral closure str exists then s t r t and t s are infra integral for any t str s 2 assume that the co subintegral s r closure exists then s r t and t s are subintegral for any t s r s proof we prove the two parts together assume that the co infra integral resp co subintegral closure exists and set u str resp u s r according to proposition 2 6 any maximal chain of u s defined by u u 0 ui un s where each ui ui 1 is minimal is such that each ui ui 1 is either ramified or decomposed 34 g picavet and m picavet resp ramified let t u s any maximal chain of u t followed by a maximal chain of t s defines a maximal chain of u s then using again proposition 2 6 we get that u t and t s are infra integral resp subintegral the following propositions show the links between the co subintegral closure the co infra integral closure the closure the u closure and the radicial closure proposition 6 11 let r s be an integral fcp extension then u sr sr tsr sr sr rs rs sr and rs sr r the following statements hold 1 usr sr if and only if r sr is infra integral 2 if the co subintegral closure exists then usr s r tsr proof we already know that usr tsr by 15 definition 1 5 and proposition 1 6 and usr sr sr by proposition 5 13 so that u sr sr tsr since usr tsr is both u closed and infra integral any minimal subextension of usr tsr is ramified by proposition 5 2 since usr sr is unramified any minimal subextension of usr sr is either decomposed or inert separable by proposition 4 8 it follows that usr sr tsr since tsr sr sr by corollary 4 13 we get that usr sr sr sr but sr sr gives usr sr sr now rs sr rs sr sr because rs sr which leads to rs sr rs tsr since we have t sr sr sr it follows that rs sr rs because rs tsr rs according to 27 corollary 3 6 to end rs sr rs sr sr sr rs sr sr tsr usr sr by the previous equalities but u sr sr r according to proposition 4 2 because r usr sr is both subintegral and then radicial and u integral then also unramified by theorem 5 7 in particular usr sr if and only if sr tsr if and only if r sr is infra integral moreover if the co subintegral closure exists s r s is subintegral and then u closed by proposition 5 2 then usr s r which leads to u sr s r tsr let r s be an integral fcp extension such that the co infra integral closure exists for the first diagram we have the following commutative diagrams closures and co closures 35 sr tsr r usr sr s str s r and sr sr sr r tsr s u sr sr sr proposition 6 12 let r s be an integral fcp extension 1 assume that the co subintegral resp co infra integral closure exists then s s r sr resp s t r t sr moreover s r sr s r r resp str tsr tst r r 2 assume that the co infra integral closure exists so that the co subintegral closure exists then usr s t r s r proof 1 set u s r sr s using proposition 6 10 we get that u s is subintegral and by proposition 2 6 we get that u s is seminormal so that u s a similar argument shows the equality for the infra integral case the two last equalities come from the properties of the seminormalization and the t closure 2 assume that the co infra integral closure exists according to corollary 6 8 the co subintegral closure exists and satisfies str s r we know by proposition 6 11 that usr s r then usr str s r assume that usr s t r s r and let v usr str s r be such that v s r is minimal since str s is infra integral v s r is either ramified or decomposed since usr s is u closed v s r is either ramified or inert by corollary 5 3 then v s r is ramified and v s is subintegral a contradiction with the definition of s r to conclude usr s t r s r thanks to proposition 6 12 we are able to give a characterization of extensions whose closures and co closures play a similar role as in almost pru fer extensions corollary 6 13 let r s be an integral fcp extension 1 assume that the co subintegral closure s r of r s exists then the following conditions are equivalent a r s r is seminormal b r sr s r c r s r is an intersection of finitely many maximal ideals of s r 2 assume that the co infra integral closure str of r s exists then the following conditions are equivalent a r str is t closed b r tsr str 36 g picavet and m picavet c r str is an intersection of finitely many maximal ideals of str and vstr r s t r vr r str proof a b in 1 and 2 by proposition 6 12 1 a c by proposition 2 8 2 a c by proposition 2 8 theorem 5 8 and proposition 5 2 proposition 6 14 let r s be a locally unbranched integral fcp extension if the co infra integral closure str exists then s t r s r proof we know that s r exists by corollary 6 8 and satisfies s t r s r in order to prove the equality of these rings it is enough to prove it locally thanks to proposition 6 4 then we may assume that r is local but the fact that r s is unbranched implies that r s is an i extension as str s which is then subintegral then str s r in 25 proposition 4 7 we proved that an fcp infra integral exten sion is catenarian theorem 6 15 let r s be an integral fcp extension set t u r s u s is subintegral then the following conditions are equivalent 1 the co subintegral closure of r s exists 2 t s is subintegral 3 t s is catenarian if these conditions hold then t is the co subintegral closure of r s proof since usr u for any u r s such that u s is subintegral we get that usr t so that t s is u closed and then an i extension by proposition 5 2 we prove that 1 2 and more precisely that t is the co subintegral closure of r s indeed let t be the co subintegral closure of r s so that t t but t u for any u r s such that u s is subintegral then t t leads to t t 2 3 by 25 proposition 4 7 3 1 if t s there is no u r s such that u s is subintegral so that s is the co subintegral closure of r s assume now that t 6 s let u r s be such that u s is subintegral then t u so that the co subintegral closure of r s if it exists is the co subintegral closure of t s and the converse also holds it follows that to show the existence of the co subintegral closure of r s it is enough to show the existence of the co subintegral closure of t s using proposition 6 4 we are reduced to show that for any m msuppt s t there exists a co subintegral closure of tm sm since t s is catenarian so is closures and co closures 37 tm sm for any m msupp s t by 25 proposition 4 3 let m msupp s t then tm sm is catenarian and unbranched and 25 theorem 4 13 asserts that tm sm tm t sm tm tsmtm sm assume that there exists some v tm sm such that v sm is subintegral we deduce that either v tsmtm or t sm tm v in case we have tsmtm sm since v sm is subintegral and tm sm is subintegral so that tm is the co subintegral closure of tm sm but in case we also have v sm t closed so that v sm a contradiction if there does not exist some v tm sm such that v sm is subintegral sm is the co subintegral closure of tm sm in any case there exists a co subintegral closure of tm sm so that there exists a co subintegral closure of t s and also of r s corollary 6 16 let r s be an integral fcp extension if usr s is catenarian then the co subintegral closure of r s exists in particular these conditions hold if r s is catenarian proof we use the ring t u r s u s is subintegral defined in theorem 6 15 it was proved in this theorem that usr t so that t s is catenarian if so is usr s then theorem 6 15 shows the existence of the co subintegral closure of r s this corollary shows in another way than in theorem 6 6 that an fcp infra integral extension admits a co subintegral closure although we have similar statements for the subintegral case the orem 6 15 and the infra integral case theorem 6 21 this last case needs some lemmata before getting the result to this aim we begin by considering an fcp extension r s with t u r s t 6 u such that t s and u s are both minimal non inert and look at the behavior of t u s lemma 6 17 let r s be an integral fcp extension assume that there exist t u r s t 6 u such that t s and u s are both minimal non inert with the same crucial maximal ideal m set v t u the following properties hold 1 t s and u s are minimal of the same type 2 m max v and m v s 3 v t and v u are t closed finite extensions 4 if t s and u s are both ramified then r s admits neither a co subintegral closure nor a co infra integral closure proof 1 according to 7 proposition 5 7 t s and u s are minimal extensions of the same type and m max v 38 g picavet and m picavet 2 since m is also an ideal of s it follows that m v s 3 we get that m max v max t and m max u so that v m t m and v m u m are finite fields extensions and then t closed extensions by 17 lemme 3 10 and so are v t and v u by 17 the ore me 3 15 in particular v s is not infra integral 4 assume that r s admits a co subintegral closure s r if t s and u s are both minimal ramified t u s r s implies that v t u s r s a contradiction by 3 since s r s is subin tegral it follows that the co infra integral closure also does not exists by corollary 6 8 lemma 6 18 let r s be an integral catenarian fcp extension let t u r s t 6 u be such that t s and u s are minimal non inert then t u s is infra integral and t u s 2 proof set v t u m t s and n u s then m and n are ideals of s assume first that m 6 n according to 7 proposition 6 6 v t and v u are both minimal non inert so that v s is infra integral assume now thatm n by lemma 6 17 we get that v t is t closed since r s has fcp there exists t v t such that t t is minimal inert by proposition 2 6 moreover m t t t s a contradiction given by 25 lemma 4 10 since r s is catenarian to conclude the only possible case is that m 6 n and t u s is infra integral with v s 2 lemma 6 19 let r s be a catenarian fcp integral extension let t u r s be such that t s is infra integral and u s is minimal non inert then t u s is infra integral if in addition t 6 u then t u t is minimal non inert proof assume first that t u then t u t so that t u s is infra integral assume now that t 6 u and set v t u we will prove that v s is infra integral and v t is minimal non inert by induction on r t s r s for r 1 we have t s 1 so that t s and u s are minimal non inert then lemma 6 18 gives the result because t 6 u assume that the result holds for some 1 r r s 2 let t u r s t 6 u be such that t s is infra integral and u s is minimal non inert with t s r 1 since r 1 t s is not minimal so that there exists t t s such that t t is minimal non inert since r s is catenarian we have t s t t t s which implies that t s r and the induction closures and co closures 39 hypothesis holds for t s and u s because t 6 u setting v t u we get that v s is infra integral with v t minimal non inert we have the following commutative diagram t t s v v u applying lemma 6 18 to the extensions t t and v t it follows that t v t t u t v v t is infra integral and so is v s in fact v 6 t otherwise v t leads to t u a contradiction moreover v t is minimal non inert then the induction hypothesis holds for r 1 and then for any r lemma 6 20 let r s be an integral catenarian fcp extension if t u r s are such that t s and u s are infra integral then t u s is infra integral proof set n u s there exists a maximal chain ui ni 0 such that u 0 s and un u with ui 1 ui minimal infra integral for each i nn set vi t ui we prove by induction on i nn that vi s is infra integral for each i nn for i 1 lemma 6 19 gives the result assume that the induction hypothesis holds for some i nn 1 so that vi s is infra integral in particular vi ui is infra integral and ui 1 ui is minimal infra integral as vi 1 t ui 1 and ui 1 ui we get that vi 1 t ui 1 ui vi ui 1 applying lemma 6 19 to the extensions vi ui and ui 1 ui we get that vi 1 ui is infra integral and so is vi 1 s to conclude the induction hypothesis holds for any i nn in particular for i n it follows that vn t u s is infra integral theorem 6 21 let r s be an integral fcp extension set t u r s u s is infra integral then the following conditions are equivalent 1 the co infra integral closure of r s exists 2 t s is infra integral 3 t s is catenarian if these conditions hold then t is the co infra integral closure of r s proof 1 2 we prove first that t is the co infra integral closure of r s indeed let t be the co infra integral closure of r s so that t t but t u for any u r s such that u s is infra integral hence t t leads to t t and then 1 2 40 g picavet and m picavet 2 1 since any u r s such that u s is infra integral verifies t u it follows that t is the co infra integral closure of r s 2 3 by 25 proposition 4 7 3 2 since r s has fcp set m t s if t s there is no u r s such that u s is infra integral so that s is the co infra integral closure of r s assume that m 1 then t s we show by induction on k nm that there exists uk t s such that uk s is infra integral with uk s k since m 1 there is some u 1 t s such that u 1 s is minimal infra integral so that the induction hypothesis holds for k 1 assume that the induction hypothesis holds for some k nm 1 so that there exists uk t s such that uk s is infra integral with uk s k in particular t uk since k m assume that for any v r s such that v s is infra integral we have uk v then t uk a contradiction this implies that there exists some v r s such that v s is infra integral with uk 6 v giving t v uk uk by lemma 6 20 v uk uk is infra integral and there exists uk 1 v uk uk such that uk 1 uk is minimal infra integral so that uk 1 s k 1 then the induction hypothesis holds for any k nm of course for k m we get that um t and t s is infra integral corollary 6 22 let r s be an integral catenarian fcp extension then the co infra integral closure of r s exists proof we use the ring t u r s u s is infra integral defined in theorem 6 21 then t s is catenarian and theorem 6 21 shows the existence of the co infra integral closure of r s proposition 6 23 let r s be an integral fcp extension with co subintegral resp co infra integral closure t for any u r s tu is the co subintegral resp co infra integral closure of u s that is s r u s u resp s t r u s t u proof since tu t s we get that tu s is subintegral resp infra integral with tu u s let v u s be such that v s is subintegral resp infra integral it follows that t v so that tu v and tu is the least v u s such that v s is subintegral resp infra integral then tu is the co subintegral resp co infra integral closure of u s remark 6 24 let r s be an integral fcp extension with co subintegral closure t and let u r s contrary to other closures like integral closure seminormalization or t closure there is no reason for u t to be the co subintegral closure of r u because u t is closures and co closures 41 not necessarily the least v r t such that u t u is subintegral the example given in remark 5 11 and theorem 6 6 show that r 2 is the co subintegral closure of r s but r 2 sr r 2 r is not the co subintegral closure of r sr since r sr is subintegral in this example since r s is infra integral r is both the co infra integral closure of r s and r sr we recall a result from 26 proposition 6 25 26 proposition 5 21 an integral fcp extension r s that is split at sr resp tsr has a co subintegral resp co infra integral closure s r resp s t r which is its complement remark 6 26 1 the last result of proposition 6 25 could also be gotten by proposition 6 12 2 let r s be an integral fcp extension such that the co subintegral closure s r exists and is a complement of sr then r s does not need to split at sr see the example of remarks 6 24 and 5 11 and take r 1 r m m then sr 1 sr and s r 1 s r r 2 we get sr 1 s r 1 r 1 and sr 1 s r 1 s but r 1 is a local ring so that r 1 s does not split at sr 1 we end this section by giving some examples where we can check if the co subintegral closure exists or not the following lemmata are special cases of lemma 6 17 and explain more precisely the situation of remark 6 3 lemma 6 27 let k s and l s be two minimal ramified exten sions where k and l are distinct fields set k k l the following properties hold 1 there exists x s x 6 0 such that x 2 0 with s k kx l lx which is a local ring moreover m kx lx is the maximal ideal of s 2 there exists a k isomorphism of k algebras k l defined for any a k by a b where b is the unique element of l such that ax bx 3 k is a field and the extension k s does not admit a co subintegral closure proof 1 since k s is ramified there exists x s x 6 0 such that x 2 0 with s k kx which is a local ring with maximal ideal m kx by theorem 1 3 since x 2 0 we have x 6 l because l is a field so that s l x then s l lx andm lx in particular kx lx 42 g picavet and m picavet 2 let a k there exists b l such that ax bx by we claim that this b is unique for such a let b l such that ax b x so that ax bx b x which leads to b b x 0 in particular b b m if not b b is a unit of s since s is a local ring which leads to x 0 a contradiction with 1 then b b m l 0 so that b b define k l by a b for any a k where b is the unique element of l such that ax bx if a k k l the equality ax ax shows that a a giving that is the identity on k for a a k we obviously have a a a a set b a and b a so that ax bx and a x b x then aa x ab x b ax b bx leads to aa a a in particular this relation shows that is a k algebra injective morphism because between two fields and is obviously surjective to conclude is a k algebra isomorphism 3 k is obviously a field and k k l s is not subintegral since there is a residual extension k s m k which is not an isomorphism anyway when k s has fcp lemma 6 17 4 shows that k s does not admit a co subintegral closure since k s l s 0 the maximal ideal of both k and l lemma 6 28 let k s and l s be two minimal decomposed extensions where k and l are distinct fields set k k l the following properties hold 1 there exists x s x 6 0 such that x 2 x with s k kx l lx moreover m 1 kx lx and m 2 k 1 x l 1 x are the maximal ideals of s 2 there exists a k isomorphism of k algebras k l defined for any a k by a b where b is the unique element of l such that ax bx 3 k is a field and the extension k s does not admit a co infra integral closure proof 1 sincek s is decomposed there exists x s x 6 0 1 such that x 2 x with s k kx which has maximal ideals m 1 kx and m 2 k 1 x by theorem 1 3 since x 2 x 0 we have x 6 l since l is a field so that s l x then s l lx and m 1 lx because x m 1 in a similar way m 2 l 1 x in particular kx lx 2 let a k there exists b l such that ax bx by as in lemma 6 27 we claim that this b is unique for such a let b l such that ax b x so that ax bx b x which would lead to b b x 0 in particular b b is not a unit of s which leads to x 0 a contradiction with 1 then b b m 1 m 2 l 0 closures and co closures 43 so that b b define k l by a b for any a k where b is the unique element of l such that ax bx if a k k l the equality ax ax shows that a a giving that is the identity on k for a a k we obviously have a a a a set b a and b a so that ax bx and a x b x then aa x ab x b ax b bx leads to aa a a in particular this relation shows that is a k algebra injective morphism because between two fields and is obviously surjective to conclude is a k algebra isomorphism 3 k is obviously a field and k k l s is not infra integral since there are two residual extensions k s mi k i 1 2 which are not an isomorphism anyway if k s has fcp since k s l s 0 the maximal ideal of both k and l a proof similar as the one of lemma 6 17 4 shows that k s does not admit a co infra integral closure we remark that there do not exist k s and l s which are two minimal infra integral extensions of different types where k and l are distinct fields indeed if k s is minimal ramified then s is local while it has two maximal ideals if l s is minimal decomposed a contradiction see also 7 proposition 5 7 the situation of lemma 6 28 is satisfied in the following example example 6 29 let k q j where j 1 i 3 2 and s k x x 2 x k x where x is the class of x in s and satisfies x 2 x then k s is a minimal decomposed extension hence infra integral and q k is a minimal separable field extension of degree 2 and then t closed set j 1 2 j x s k because x 6 k a short calculation shows that is a zero of the irreducible polynomial x 2 x 1 q x so that l q is a field with l q s l 6 k because 6 k and q l a minimal separable field extension of degree 2 moreover x 6 l since l is a field and x 2 x 0 since 2 x 1 2 1 this shows that 2 x 1 is a unit of l x then j x 2 x 1 1 l x so that s l x it follows that l s is a minimal decomposed extension and then infra integral as q k l lemma 6 28 shows that q s does not admit a co infra integral closure by lemma 6 17 we get that an fcp extension of the form t u s where t s and u s are minimal ramified with the same crucial maximal ideal does not admit a co subintegral closure if t s 6 u s then 7 proposition 6 6 asserts that t u s is subintegral and then t u is the co subintegral closure of t u s the following 44 g picavet and m picavet proposition exhibits cases where situation of lemma 6 17 does not occur proposition 6 30 let r s be an unbranched integral fcp exten sion where r p and s n are local rings assume that r p s n is a finite separable field extension then there does not exist t u r s t 6 u such that t s and u s are minimal ramified with the same crucial maximal ideal proof assume that there exist t u r s t 6 u such that t s and u s are minimal ramified with the same crucial maximal ideal m set v t u according to lemma 6 17 v t and v u are t closed finite extensions such thatm v s v t v u max v set k v m k t m l u m 6 k s s m and n n m since s n k l we get that r p k and r p l are finite separable field extensions and so are k k and k l then there exists k such that k k moreover k s and l s are distinct minimal ramified extensions we are in the situation of lemma 6 27 so that there exists x s x 6 0 such that x 2 0 with s k x l x where n kx lx is the maximal ideal of s in particular n 2 0 furthermore there exists a k isomorphism of k algebras k l defined for any a k by a b where b is the unique element of l such that ax bx set which gives l k since x x in s we have x 0 so that y n satisfies y 2 0 with y 6 0 let q x n i 0 aix i k x be the minimal monic polynomial of which is also the minimal monic polynomial of through then q q y 0 n i 0 ai y i n i 0 ai i n i 0 iaiy i 1 q yq yq with q k l which is a field it follows that q 0 since y 6 0 but q x is a separable polynomial a contradiction with q x the minimal polynomial of to conclude our assumptions do not hold and there do not exist t u r s t 6 u such that t s and u s are minimal ramified with the same crucial maximal ideal contrary to proposition 6 30 example 6 29 shows that there exist t u r s t 6 u such that t s and u s are minimal decomposed with the same crucial maximal ideal where r p is a local ring max s m 1 m 2 and r p s mi is a finite separable field extension for i 1 2 it is enough to take r q t k and u l so that s mi k l for i 1 2 r p q and r p s mi is a finite separable field extension for i 1 2 closures and co closures 45 7 cardinality of the lattices of integral fip extensions let r s be an integral fip extension we are going to give information about r s because r s is a b extension it is enough to assume that r is a local ring in order to examine the elements of r s we use the different closures the t closure and the seminormalization we studied in the previous sections to get bounds for r s let r s be an integral fcp extension and t its seminormalization resp t closure when it exists let t be its co subintegral resp co infra integral closure define the map r s r t t s by u t u tu for any u r s recall that t o denotes the complement of t in r s when it exists and is unique the following proposition gives relations between the existences of a complement of t and t proposition 7 1 let r s be an integral fcp consider the follow ing conditions 1 is bijective 2 is surjective 3 t admits a complement 4 t o exists 5 t exists we have the following implications 1 2 3 1 4 3 and 3 5 4 with t t o in this last case proof we make the proof for t sr 1 2 is obvious 2 3 since is surjective there exists u r s such that u r s t u tu so that t u r and tu s which shows that u is a complement of t 1 4 since is bijective the previous proof shows that t has a unique complement 3 5 4 assume that t has a complement v and that the co subintegral closure t exists by definition tv s implies that v s is subintegral so that t v assume that t 6 v since r v is seminormal so is t v and t v is subintegral because so is t s then t v and t has a unique complement t o t when t tsr it is enough to replace in the previous proof semi normal with t closed and subintegral with infra integral we begin to consider integral u closed extensions 46 g picavet and m picavet lemma 7 2 let r s be an integral fcp u closed extension where r m is a local ring such that r 6 sr 6 s assume that r s is t closed for any s r s such that ms is the maximal ideal of s then sr has a complement if in addition this complement is unique then it is the co subintegral closure of r s that is sr o s r proof recall that sr t sr and spec s spec r is a bijection by proposition 5 2 moreover r s is unbranched and only ramified and inert minimal extensions appear in a maximal chain of extensions composing r s set f u r s u s is subintegral we have f 6 because s f since r s has fcp there exists some u 0 f such that u 0 s is maximal so that there does not exists any v r u 0 such that v u 0 is minimal ramified as r s is not subintegral r 6 u 0 then according to 6 lemma 17 mu 0 is a radical ideal of u 0 that is an intersection of maximal ideals of u 0 but u 0 is a local ring so that mu 0 is the maximal ideal of u 0 giving that r u 0 is t closed by assumption then u 0 6 s because r s is not t closed as u 0 s is subintegral we get that sr u 0 r and sru 0 s so that u 0 is a complement of sr assume in addition that this complement is unique and let t be this complement then t f of course sr t r and srt s show that r t is t closed and t s is subintegral set t u f so that t t if t 6 t there exists some v f with v 6 t s choose such v 6 t s satisfying that v s is maximal as we proved in the beginning of the proof for u 0 we get that v is a complement of sr a contradiction with the uniqueness of this complement then t t implies that t s is subintegral so that t is the co subintegral closure of r s by theorem 6 15 remark 7 3 lemma 6 17 shows that when tsr has more than one complement then the co subintegral closure of r s does not exists contrary to proposition 6 30 where separable field extensions ap pear here is an example illustrating lemma 7 2 in the context of radi cial field extensions example 7 4 let k be a field with c k 2 and let k k t be a radicial field extension of degree 2 such that t 2 a k set s k x x 2 k x where x is the class of x in s so that k s is a minimal ramified extension and set t x then 2 t 2 a k so that l k is a radicial field extension of k of degree 2 with y 2 a the minimal polynomial of and l is a field different from k since x 6 k moreover l s is a minimal ramified extension and k s has fcp this example illustrates also lemma 6 27 the maximal closures and co closures 47 ideal of s is kx lx since k is a field its maximal ideal is 0 and for any s r s such that 0 s 0 is the maximal ideal of s we have that s is a field so that k s is t closed then k s satisfies the assumptions of lemma 7 2 in particular k tsk k kx k lx because k lx k shows that k k is subintegral while k s is t closed because k s lx with k k lx s lx l a field extension such that l k to end we remark that k and l are both complements of tsk in case r s is an integral u closed fip extension the following proposition shows that when sr has a complement it is unique and equal to the co subintegral closure of r s when this last one exists proposition 7 5 let r s be an integral u closed fip extension assume that r m is a local ring and r 6 sr 6 s 1 if sr has a complement then ms 6 max s moreover this complement is unique if in addition s r exists then sr o s r 2 the map r s r sr sr s defined by u u sr sru for u r s is injective in particular r sr sr s 1 r s r sr sr s proof 1 let t r s be a complement of sr since r t sr and s srt we have t 6 r s because r s is neither subintegral nor t closed in particular t s is subintegral so that there exists some u t s such that u s is minimal ramified then 6 lemma 17 shows thatms is not a radical ideal of s and in particular ms 6 max s let n be the maximal ideal of s which is a local ring because r s is u closed assume now that there exist another complement t r s of sr set t t t s hence m is also the maximal ideal of t and t since r t and r t are t closed and also an ideal of t a local ring since r s is an i extension set k r m k t m k t m and k t m k k so that k k and k are fields with k k s n because t s and t s are subintegral moreover k k has fip since so has r s and k is a local artinian ring we claim that k cannot be a field because k 6 k otherwise if k is a field and k 6 k then k k and t t so that m t t max t which gives that t t is t closed a contradiction because t s is subintegral using 1 theorem 3 8 we have to look at two cases assume first that k then k k for some k which satisfies 3 0 in this case dimk k 3 and is a prime number but dimk k 48 g picavet and m picavet dimk k k k gives that either dimk k 1 or k k 1 this last condition cannot happen since k 6 k so that dimk k 1 which gives k k k a contradiction at last if k is a finite field so are k and k moreover they are isomorphic as k algebras and k k k are galois according to 7 proposition 7 8 we get a contradiction since t s is subintegral then t t now t s r by proposition 7 1 when s r exists 2 we next consider r s r sr sr s defined by t t sr srt for t r s set r t sr and s srt then sr s r let t r s be such that t t then t and t are both complements of s r in r s it follows that t t applying 1 to the extension r s so that is injective so we get r s r sr sr s and r sr sr s 1 r s comes from r sr sr s r s with r sr sr s sr corollary 7 6 let r s be an integral u closed fip extension as sume that r m is a local ring and r 6 sr 6 s if r s is t closed for any r s r sr sr s and for any s r s such that m s max s where max r m then r s r sr sr s proof first observe that r s r sr sr s implies that s r sr since r s is an i extension any element of r s is a local ring using the notation of the proof of proposition 7 5 we have r s r sr sr s if and only if is surjective if and only if for any r s r sr sr s there exists t r s such that r t sr and s srt if r sr it is enough to take t s and if s sr it is enough to take t r then holds also assume that for any r s r sr sr s and for any s r s such that m s max s where max r m this im plies that r s is t closed we have r 6 s r ts r 6 s applying lemma 7 2 to the extension r s we get that there exists t r s r s such that r t sr and s srt and holds it follows that r s r sr sr s proposition 7 7 let r s be a seminormal integral fcp exten sion such that r m is a local ring and tsr 6 r s the following statements hold 1 s is a semilocal ring whose maximal ideals are n 1 np then r s m i npni 2 tsr has a complement in r s if and only if s ni s nj as r m algebras for each i j np closures and co closures 49 3 if in addition this complement is unique then it is the co infra integral closure of r s proof 1 s is a semilocal ring because r s is a finite extension let n 1 np be its maximal ideals by proposition 2 8 r s is an intersection of finitely many maximal ideals of s and of r so that r s m i npni 2 since r s m is an ideal of s let s s m be the canonical map as m i npni we get that s s m i np s ni set k r m and ki s ni for each i np which are field extensions of k moreover ts k t sr m by 17 proposition 2 10 let t r s so that t t m k i np ki up to a k algebra isomorphism it follows that t is a complement of tsr in r s if and only if t is a complement of ts k in k s if and only if t ts k k and t ts k s assume that this condition holds then k t is t closed so that t is a field extension of k by 17 lemme 3 10 and t s is seminormal infra integral giving that ki t as k algebras for each i np so that s ni s nj as r m algebras for each i j np conversely assume that s ni s nj as r m algebras for each i j np so that ki kj as k algebras for each i j np set for example k k 1 so that s kp let t k s be such that t k through the diagonal map so that k t is t closed and t s is seminormal infra integral there exists t r s such that t t and satisfying r t is t closed and t s is seminormal infra integral then t tsr r and t tsr s which shows that t is a complement of tsr 3 assume in addition that the complement of tsr is unique we are going to show that it is the co infra integral closure of r s we keep the previous notation with t the complement of tsr and to make simpler the proof assume that s kp which is satisfied up to an isomorphism let u r s be such that u s is infra integral then u is a semilocal ring set max u m 1 mn so that m j nnmj since u s is infra integral we have u mj s ni for any ni lying over mj but s ni k as r m algebra for each i np leads to u mj k as r m algebra for each j nn then u m kn in particular there exists v r u such that v k this shows that r v is t closed and v s is seminormal infra integral this means that v is a complement of tsr by uniqueness of this complement it follows that v t giving t u then t is the co infra integral closure of r s 50 g picavet and m picavet remark 7 8 let r s be an fip seminormal extension such that t sr 6 r s assume that r m is a local ring then s is semilocal since r s is a finite extension let n 1 np be the maximal ideals of s as in corollary 7 6 we can define a map r s r tsr tsr s by t t tsr tsrt but contrary to the results of this corollary we are going to show that is not always injective and never surjective assume first that there exists t such that r t is t closed and t s is infra integral so that t r s and t is a complement of tsr then m max t each ni lies over m in t and m pi 1 ni r s by proposition 2 8 moreover s ni t m for each i 1 p set k r m k t m and l s m p i 1 s ni kp assume that the galois group of the field extension k k has more than one element and let be such an element different from the identity since r t has fip so has k k and there exists x k algebraic over k such that k k x in view of the primitive element theorem in particular x 6 x set y x x x kp and k k y then k and k are k isomorphic distinct k subalgebras of kp and the inverse image t of k under the canonical map s s m is an r subalgebra of s such that r t tsr and s tsrt with t 6 t it follows that t t and is not injective see also example 6 29 where k l with k 6 l but if k k is a radicial extension its galois group has only one element and kp has no k subalgebra isomorphic to k distinct from k then there is a unique complement of tsr this reasoning still holds for any r s r tsr tsr s in this case is injective now we claim that is never surjective for each i np set mi ni tsr then tsr mi r m let r 1 tsr s be such that tsr r 1 is minimal inert with conductor m 1 max tsr after a suitable reordering and set n j nj r 1 for j 2 p it follows that tr 1 r t sr in view of proposition 2 6 and r r 1 is an fip seminormal extension moreover r 1 n j tsr mj r m for each j 2 p but r 1 m 1 6 tsr m 1 so that r 1 m 1 6 r 1 n j for each j 2 p it follows by proposition 7 7 that tr 1 r does not admits a complement in r r 1 so that there does not exist t such that tsrt r 1 and r t sr t then is not surjective proposition 7 9 let r s be an infra integral fcp extension the map r s r sr sr s defined by t t sr srt is injective in particular if r s has fip then r s r sr sr s closures and co closures 51 proof let u u r s be such that u u set r u sr and s sru then sr s r with r s infra integral moreover u and u are both complements of s r as theorem 6 6 asserts that r s admits a co subintegral closure t it follows from proposition 7 1 that t u u so that is injective then r s r sr sr s if r s has fip the following proposition gives us another way to calculate r s when r s is an integral fip extension with r local proposition 7 10 let r s be an fip integral extension over the local ring r m and set max s n 1 np let n r s be the number of complements of tsr in r s the following conditions hold 1 there exists a greatest r subalgebra r of s such that m is an ideal of r 2 if s ni 6 s nj as r m algebras for some i 6 j np then n r s 0 3 assume that n r s 6 0 then any complement t of tsr is in r r and satisfies s ni t m for any i np let p x r m x be the minimal monic polynomial of some y t m such that t m r m y for any i np there exists some yi s ni such that s ni r m yi where p x is also the minimal monic polynomial of yi moreover n r s r m x x r m p x 0 proof first observe that s is semilocal by propositions 2 6 and 2 8 1 set r t r s m is an ideal of t then r is a finite nonempty set it has maximal elements assume that r and r are two maximal elements of r if r 6 r then r r r with r r r a contradiction then r has a unique maximal element which is its greatest element let r be this element 2 assume that s ni 6 s nj as r m algebras for some i 6 j np and that n r s 6 0 then tsr admits some complement t such that r t is t closed so that t is local with maximal ideal m and t s is infra integral it follows that s ni t m for each i np in particular s ni s nj as r m algebras for each i 6 j np a contradiction whence n r s 0 3 according to 2 n r s 6 0 implies that s ni s nj as r m algebras for each i j np assume that tsr admits some complement t so that r t is t closed therefore t is local with maximal ideal m whence m r t giving t r r then r m t m is a finite fip field extension so that there exists some y t m such that t m r m y since t s is infra integral 52 g picavet and m picavet so that s ni t m for each i np let i t m s ni be the r m algebra isomorphism and set yi i y for each i np it follows that s ni i t m i r m y r m i y r m yi let p x r m x be the minimal monic polynomial of y then p x is also the minimal monic polynomial of yi and t m r m x p x s ni for each i np let t be another complement of tsr as we have just seen before t r r and is local with maximal ideal m and t s is infra integral which implies that s ni t m for each i np then there exists an r m algebra isomorphism t t setting x y we get that p x is also the minimal monic polynomial of x conversely let x r m be such that p x 0 and let t r r be the inverse image of r m x by the canonical map r r m then t is an r subalgebra of s with maximal ideal m because t m r m x r m x p x which is a field so that r t is t closed since m r t as we have t m r m x p x s ni for each i np it follows that t s is infra integral then t is a complement of tsr to end let x x r m be such that p x p x 0 if r m x r m x their inverse images by give the same t then n r s r m x x r m p x 0 we deduce the following theorem theorem 7 11 let r s be an fip integral extension over the lo cal ring r m for each r s r tsr tsr s let n r s be the number of complements of ts r in r s then r s r s r t s r t s r s n r s proof let r s r tsr tsr s as we already have seen we have tsr t s r let t r s set r t tsr and s tsrt so that r s r tsr tsr s then t r s and is a complement of ts r tsr in r s moreover for any r s r tsr tsr s such that r s 6 r s we get that t is not a complement of ts r tsr in r s consider the map r s r tsr tsr s defined by t t tsr tsrt since n r s t r s r t ts r s ts r t we get that n r s t r s t r s it follows that r s r s r t s r t s r s n r s be cause t r s implies that t r s we may remark that it can be that n r s 0 for some r s r tsr tsr s according to proposition 7 10 2 closures and co closures 53 remark 7 12 in the preceding theorem we may define n r s even if r is not a local ring but since r s is an integral fip extension it is a b extension moreover for any m msuppr s r we have t s m r m t s r m so that for some t r s we have r t ts r and s ts r t if and only if r m tm ts m r m and s m t s m r mtm for anym msuppr s r it follows that n r s n i 1 n r mi s mi which we can calculate using proposition 7 10 we now consider some types of integral fip extensions we still work with an extension r s such that r m is a local ring since r s is a b extension in the following proposition we recall and generalize a result of 5 using the nagata rings r x and s x proposition 7 13 let r s be an fip subintegral extension as sume that r m is a local ring 1 5 proposition 4 13 if r m then r s is chained and r s r s 1 2 assume that r m and let n be the nilpotency index of m r s if r sm 2 s is chained and lr ms m n 1 then r s is chained and r s r s 1 lr n m where n is the maximal ideal of s proof since r is a local ring and r s is an fip subintegral exten sion s is also a local ring 2 assume that r m r sm 2 s is chained and lr ms m n 1 by 5 corollary 3 31 we get that r x s x has fip more over r x mr x is a local ring such that r x mr x and r x s x is a finite subintegral extension 5 lemma 3 15 then 1 gives that r x s x is chained but the map r s r x s x defined by t t x for each t r s is an order preserving and order reflecting injection 5 lemma 3 1 d so that r s is also chained giving r s r s 1 lr n m 1 by 4 lemma 5 4 remark 7 14 1 when r m is a local ring with r m such that r x s x has not fip the previous reasoning does not hold as well as the equalities of proposition 7 13 2 we use 5 example 3 12 to illustrate this situation let k be a finite field with n k set t k y y 4 k y where y is the class of y in t so that y 4 0 then t is a finite local artinian ring with maximal ideal n yt moreover k t is finite subintegral let s k t be such that s t is minimal ramified then s is also a finite local artinian ring let m be its maximal ideal then n 2 m 54 g picavet and m picavet gives y 2 y 3 m so that k y 2 y 3 s t implies k y 2 y 3 s by considering the dimensions of the different k vector spaces obviously k k k y 3 and k k k y 2 y 3 are minimal extensions all distinct for any k moreover k s and k s are also minimal extensions then k t k k k s t k so that k t n 4 as k t is not chained k x t x has not fip according to 5 corollary 3 31 2 we can add another property about r s for an fip subintegral extension r s when r m is a finite local ring let n be the maximal ideal of s and let t r s be such that t s is a minimal ramified extension then p t s is the maximal ideal of t and an n primary ideal of s such that p and n are adjacent in s equivalently dimr m n p 1 by theorem 1 3 assume that there exists t r s such that t s is minimal with t s p then t t r p conversely if p is an n primary ideal of s such that p and n are adjacent in s and m p r setting s r p we get that s s is a minimal ramified extension then the map p an n primary ideal of s p and n adjacent m p r s r s s s minimal defined by p r p is a bijection let m be the number of n primary ideals p of s such that p and n are adjacent and m p r in particular if lr n m 2 then r s 2 by 4 lemma 5 4 and r s m 2 it follows by 22 theorem 6 1 6 that either r s 3 or r s r m 3 in case we get that r s is chained and m 1 in case we get that r m m 1 proposition 7 15 let r s be an fip integral t closed extension with c r s then r s m vr c s ms r m in fact s ms r m is the number of r m subalgebras of s sm proof since r s is t closed c r s is an intersection of maximal ideals of r and s by proposition 2 8 since r s is an i extension for each m vr c there is one and only one max imal ideal n of s lying over m we claim that n is of the form n sm first sm n but mrm msm msn nsn by 2 proposition 2 page 40 and proposition 2 6 since sm sn moreover for m max r m 6 m we have msm sm nsm then n sm since r s is a b extension we have r s m msupp s r rm sm but mrm rm sm so that rm mrm sm mrm rm sm by 4 proposition 3 7 since mrm max sm it follows that rm mrm sm mrm is a field extension at last rm mrm r m and sm mrm s ms closures and co closures 55 we end this section with open questions in lemma 7 2 we proved that for a u closed integral extension r s where r is a local ring under some special assumptions if sr has a unique complement in r s then it is the co subintegral closure of r s we can ask if the same result holds in the more general situation of proposition 7 5 in a similar way proposition 7 7 shows that for a seminormal integral ex tension r s where r is a local ring under some special assumptions if tsr has a unique complement in r s then it is the co infra integral closure of r s we can ask if the same result holds in the more general situation of proposition 7 10 references 1 d d anderson d e dobbs and b mullins the primitive element theo rem for commutative algebras houston j math 25 1999 603
