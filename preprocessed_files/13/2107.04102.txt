subextensions and is mainly devoted to fcp ex tensions extensions whose lattices are artinian and noetherian the object of the paper is the introduction and the study of ele ments of the lattices that split in some sense ring extensions the reason why is that this splitting was used in earlier paper without their common nature being recognized there are some favorable cases allowing to build splitters mainly when we are dealing with b extensions for example integral extensions integral closures and pru fer hulls of extensions play a dual role the paper gives many combinatorics results with the explicit computation of the pru fer hull of an fcp extension we show that a split extension cannot be pinched except trivially 1 introduction and notation we consider the category of commutative and unital rings whose epimorphisms will be involved if r s is a ring extension we denote by r s the set of all r subalgebras of s and set r s r s r s with a similar definition for r s or r s the poset r s is a lattice whose operations are defined by u v 7 u v and u v 7 uv for u v r s called the lattice of the extension in the context of the paper for an extension r s and t r s the support suppr s t of the r module s t is a preponderant tool as well as msuppr s t suppr s t max r as a general rule the subscript r is dropped and specified if it is not r a chain of r subalgebras of s is a set of elements of r s that are pairwise comparable with respect to inclusion we say that the extension r s has fcp or is an fcp extension if each chain in r s is finite or equivalently the lattice of the extension is artinian and noetherian in case r s has finitely many elements we say that 2010 mathematics subject classification primary 13 b 02 13 b 21 13 b 22 sec ondary 13 b 30 13 f

abs 2107 04102 v 1 2 g picavet and m picavet the extension has fip or is an fip extension dobbs and the authors characterized fcp and fip extensions 13 we start by explaining the ideas that lead us to write this paper the two books 18 and 19 authored by knebusch and his co authors introduce pru fer extensions and we use their terminology and results they are known in the literature as normal pairs but the key point is that an extension r s is pru fer if and only if r t is a flat epimorphism for each t r s we are interested in factorizations of ring extensions introduced in 18 and comprehensively studied in 19 an element u of the lattice r s of an extension is called a factor of the extension if u has a com plement v in the sense of lattices that is r u v and s uv it can be shown that for a pru fer extension these two last conditions are equivalent to the following diagram is a pushout and a pullback u r s v moreover since uv u v holds for a pru fer extension we get that 0 u r s r v r 0 is a split exact sequence of r modules now for an arbitrary extension the nice properties of complements or factors that hold for pru fer extensions are no longer true as our paper focusses on fcp extensions and complements may appear in a hidden form a fact we observed in our earlier papers on fcp extensions it seemed to us that a systematic study was necessary the key idea to get a theory that provides substantial results is the following we say that a ring extension r s is split at t r s if the supports of the r modules t r and s t do not meet the theorem 4 8 shows that when the extension has fcp and is split at t then t has a unique complement t o verifying tt o t t o moreover there is an order isomorphism r s r t t s defined by v 7 v t v t there is crosswise exchange between the maximal support of t r and s t o and the maximal support of t o r and s t but the reader should note that the proof relies heavily on properties of fcp extensions the properties of split extensions are the subject of section 4 it is now time to introduce the definition of a splitter x at a subset x of msuppr s r an element t of r s is a splitter of the extension at x if x msuppr t r and x c msuppr s t where xc is the complement of x in msuppr s r in which case we set x t because such a t is unique naturally each element that splitting ring extensions 3 splits an extension is a splitter and vice versa a comprehensive study of splitters is given in section 4 with the notation of the above quoted theorem we have t o xc if x msupp t r we show that splitters exist in case we deal with an fcpb extension that is an element of r s is uniquely determined by an element of rm sm m msupp s r actually an fcp extension r s is a b extension if and only if r p is a local ring for each p supp s r this last condition being valid if the extension is integral 28 proposition 2 21 theorem 4 6 states that an fcp extension is a b extension if and only if each subset of its maximal support has a splitter the properties of b extensions are studied in section 3 a chained fcp extension like a pru fer manis extension is a b extension this last fact is already an indication that we have to give a strong look at pru fer extensions especially because an fcp extension r s has an integral closure r which is pru fer in s i e the extension is quasi pru fer or equivalently the extension is an inc pair see 18 moreover an fcp extension is a b extension if r s is a b extension among other results the deep and hard theorem 3 10 characterizes pru fer fcp extensions that are b extensions by the way generalizing ayache jarboui s nice results on normal pairs of domains note that these authors did not consider b extensions section 5 explores the properties of fcpb extensions and their split ters for an fcp b extension r s and an elementm of its maximal support we can consider the elementary splitter m we then ob serve that any splitter of a subset x of its maximal support is the product in a unique way of all the elementary splitters m where m x proposition 5 11 it is also interesting to know that x is the intersection of some large quotient rings of the form r m where m varies in the complement of x when the extension is integral this decomposition is related to a primary decomposition of the r i module x r where i is the conductor of the extension among many other results we have the following theorem 5 18 if r s is an fcp b extension then any element of r s is a splitter if and only if the extension is fip locally chained and its lattice is boolean another principal aim of the paper concerns almost pru fer exten sions that are extensions r s such that r s is integral where r is the pru fer hull of the extension 26 they are quasi pru fer and an fcp extension is almost pru fer if and only if it splits at r or at r see proposition 4 3 in section 6 we characterize fcp extensions that are almost pru fer by conditions on length or by order isomorphisms of 4 g picavet and m picavet lattices associated to the lattices of some subextensions we also con sider in the same way the almost pru fer closures of fcp or fip exten sions one of the most striking result is as follows an fcp extension r s is almost pru fer if and only if the natural map r r r s is an order isomorphism moreover we are able to compute the pru fer hull of an fcp extension r s as an intersection of some large quo tient rings and also as the large quotient ring of r with respect to 1 r r all other results are difficult to sum up and the reader is invited to look at section 6 for more details section 7 contains information on pinched extensions if an extension is pinched at an element of its lattice it cannot be split at this element except it is trivial the case of an fip extension is particularly vivid a special look is given at fcp extensions that are pinched at the integral closure id est each element of the lattice is comparable to the integral closure we develop a new criterion and apply it to dobbs jarboui av ring pairs and ayache recent results 2 some notation and definitions a local ring is here what is called elsewhere a quasi local ring as usual spec r and max r are the set of prime and maximal ideals of a ring r if r s is a ring extension and p spec r then sp is both the localization sr p as a ring and the localization at p of ther module s for an ideal i of a ring r we write v i p spec r i p and d i for its complement the support of an r module e is suppr e p spec r ep 6 0 and msuppr e suppr e max r when r s is an extension we will set supp t r suppr t r and supp s t suppr s t for each t r s unless otherwise specified we denote by r s the conductor of the extension r s while the integral closure of r in s is denoted by r s or by r if no confusion can occur recall that a ring extension r s is called an i extension if the natural map spec s spec r is injective definition 2 1 an extension r s is called crucial if msupp s r 1 in this case setting msupp s r m where m is a maximal ideal of r m is called the crucial maximal ideal c r s of r s and the extension is called m crucial we gave a different definition of crucial extensions 8 definition 2 10 that is an extension r s is crucial if supp s r 1 our new definition is more suitable for this paper moreover supp s r 1 implies msupp s r 1 splitting ring extensions 5 one of our tools are the minimal ring extensions introduced by ferrand olivier 17 an extension r s is called minimal if r s r s simple if s r t for some t s and locally minimal if rm sm is minimal for each m msupp s r a minimal ex tension is simple and is either integral finite or a flat epimorphism 17 the ore me 2 2 three types of minimal integral extensions ex ist ramified decomposed and inert whose definitions are given by the following theorem a minimal extension is crucial theorem 2 2 13 theorem 2 2 let r t be an extension and m r t then r t is minimal and finite if and only if m max r and one of the following three conditions holds inert case m max t and r m t m is a minimal field extension decomposed case there existm 1 m 2 max t such thatm m 1 m 2 and the natural maps r m t m 1 and r m t m 2 are both isomorphisms ramified case there existsm max t such thatm 2 m m t m r m 2 and the natural map r m t m is an isomorphism in each of the above cases m c r t and r t is an i extension when either inert or ramified definition 2 3 1 let r s be an integral extension then r s is called infra integral 23 if all its residual extensions are isomorphisms and subintegral 31 if r s is an infra integral i extension 2 let r s be a ring extension the seminormalization sr is the largest subextension t r s such that r t is subintegral and also the least subextension t r s such that t s is seminormal the t closure tsr is the largest subextension t r s such that r t is infra integral and also the least subextension t r s such that t s is t closed the canonical decomposition of an arbitrary ring extension r s is r sr t sr r s an fcp extension which is either subintegral or t closed is an i extension 30 proposition 2 10 we do not give here the definition of a seminormal or t closed exten sion see 31 and 23 for the definitions but give a characterization in the context of fcp extensions the arguments of the following propositions have often appeared in earlier papers we state them now to get a reference we emphasize that the following result is crucial 6 g picavet and m picavet proposition 2 4 an integral fcp extension r s is seminormal if and only if r s is an intersection of finitely many maximal ideals of s and this intersection is irredundant in r and s proof set c r s since r s is an integral fcp exten sion vr c resp vs c is finite and contained in max r resp max s by 13 theorem 4 2 assume first that r s is seminormal and fcp then c is a radical ideal of s by 13 lemma 4 8 an intersection of finitely many maximal ideals of s by conversely assume that c is an intersection of finitely many max imal ideals of s let t r s r then c is also an ideal of t which is an intersection of finitely many maximal ideals of t but c r t so that r t is an intersection of finitely many maximal ideals of t by 22 lemma 4 7 it follows that r s is seminormal according to 13 lemma 4 8 the last result is obvious proposition 2 5 an fcp integral extension r s is t closed if and only if r s is an intersection of finitely maximal ideals of s such that vr r s vs r s proof let m msupp s r assume that r s is an fcp t closed extension then r s is an fcp seminormal extension so that r s is an intersection of finitely maximal ideals of s by proposition 2 4 moreover r s is an i extension by definition 2 3 so that vr r s vs r s conversely assume that r s is an intersection of finitely maximal ideals of s such that vr r s vs r s localizing at any m vr r s it follows that we can assume that r m is a local ring because r s is t closed if and only if rm sm is t closed for any m max r by 23 the ore me 3 15 then r s m is the only maximal ideal of s considering the extension r m s m 23 lemme 3 10 shows that r s is t closed because so is r m s m the connection between the above ideas is that if r s has fcp then any maximal necessarily finite chain c of r subalgebras of s of the form r r 0 r 1 rn 1 rn s with length c n results from juxtaposing n minimal extensions ri ri 1 0 i n 1 for any extension r s the length r s of r s is the supremum of the lengths of chains of r subalgebras of s notice that if r s splitting ring extensions 7 has fcp then there does exist some maximal chain of r subalgebras of s with length r s 14 theorem 4 11 we will say that an extension r s is chained if r s is a chain recall that an extension r s is called pru fer if r t is a flat epimorphism for each t r s or equivalently if r s is a normal pair 18 theorem 5 2 p 47 a useful result is 18 theorem 5 2 p 47 48 which states that a ring extension r s is pru fer if and only if r s r s r s for each s s note that a pru fer integral extension is an isomorphism the pru fer hull of an extension r s is the greatest pru fer subextension r of r s 24 in 26 we defined a quasi pru fer extension as an extension that can be factored r r s where r r is integral and r s is pru fer or equivalently r s is pru fer an fcp extension is quasi pru fer 26 corollary 3 4 in 26 a minimal flat epimorphism being pru fer is called a pru fer minimal extension an extension r s is called almost pru fer if r s is integral or equivalently when r s is fcp whence quasi pru fer if s r r 26 theorem 4 6 an almost pru fer extension is quasi pru fer finally x is the cardinality of a set x denotes proper inclusion and if x y we denote by xc its complement in y and for a positive integer n we set nn 1 n 3 b extensions let r s be an fcp extension with msupp s r mi n i 1 recall that msupp s r by 13 corollary 3 2 according to 13 theorem 3 6 the map r s n i 1 rmi smi defined by t tmi n i 1 is injective in 28 the paragraph before proposition 2 21 we say that r s is a b extension if is bijective b stands for bijective in this case is an order isomorphism for the product order on n i 1 rmi smi we characterized an fcp b extension as follows adding now a property of the length of such an extension proposition 3 1 28 proposition 2 21 an fcp extension r s is a b extension if and only if r p is local for each p supp s r and in this case r s rm sm m msupp s r the above local condition on the factor domains r p holds in case supp s r max r and in particular if r s is integral proof we have to prove the equation set msupp s r m 1 mn if is bijective r s n i 1 rmi smi n i 1 rmi smi by 13 proposition 3 7 d there is a misprint in the quoted reference 8 g picavet and m picavet let t r s then t r s is called a complement of t if t t r and tt s if t is the unique complement of t in r s we write t t o an extension r s is called boolean if r s is a distributive lattice that is such that intersection and product are each distribu tive with respect to the other and such that each t r s has a necessarily unique complement corollary 3 2 an fcp extension r s is locally minimal if and only if r s is an fip b extension such that r s 2 msupp s r if these conditions hold then r s is a boolean extension such that r s msupp s r proof assume first that r s is locally minimal we show that r s is a b extension let p supp s r and assume that p 6 max r then there exists m msupp s r such that p m in particular there exist t u r s such that t u is minimal with p c t u r but rm tm um sm is minimal with tm 6 um because tp 6 up it follows that rm tm and um sm then m msupp u r and there exists a unique n max t lying over m so that tm tn and um un this implies that n msuppt u t so that n c t u a contradiction with p c t u r m n r then r s is a b extension it follows that r s is an fip extension since rm sm 2 for any m msupp s r and the definition of a b extension gives r s 2 msupp s r conversely assume that r s is an fip b extension such that r s 2 msupp s r it follows that rm sm 2 for each m msupp s r so that r s is locally minimal if these conditions hold then r s is boolean according to 28 proposition 3 5 and example 3 3 1 by proposition 3 1 we get that r s msupp s r the statement of corollary 3 2 admits equivalent statements if the extension is either pru fer proposition 3 9 or split theorem 5 18 the local condition for b extension holds for every prime ideals of pm rings introduced by de marco and orsatti in 9 they are also called gelfand rings by some other authors a ring r is a pm ring if every prime ideal of r is contained in a unique maximal ideal of r of course a local ring is a pm ring we deduce the obvious following result proposition 3 3 if r is a pm ring then any fcp extension r s is a b extension splitting ring extensions 9 we exhibit in example 6 15 an fcp b extension r s such that r is not a pm ring proposition 3 4 a chained fcp extension r s is a b extension for example a pru fer manis fcp extension is a b extension proof proposition 3 1 gives the answer let p supp s r and as sume there exist m m max r m 6 m such that p m m according to 27 lemma 1 8 there exist t t r s t 6 t such that r t and r t are minimal with m c r t and m c r t a contradiction with r s is chained then p is contained in a unique maximal ideal of r and r s is a b extension assume that r s is a pru fer manis fcp extension then r s is chained by 18 theorem 3 1 page 187 hence r s is a b extension since fcp by using the next result we can reduce in some contexts the char acterization of fcp b extensions to the case of pru fer extensions proposition 3 5 let r s be an fcp extension 1 if r s is a b extension so is r s 2 if r s is a b extension and r r is an i extension then r s is a b extension 3 if r s is a b extension and t r s then r t is a b extension proof we use the characterization of proposition 3 1 1 assume that r s is a b extension and let p supp s r to show thatr s is ab extension it is enough to consider p 6 max r so that p 6 supp r r since supp r r max r this implies that p suppr s r but p 6 supp r r implies that there is a unique q spec r lying over p so that rp rq by 13 lemma 2 4 in particular q suppr s r let ri n i 0 be a maximal chain of r s there exists some i nn such that q r c ri 1 ri since r s is a b extension q is contained in a unique maximal ideal of r then p q r is contained in a unique maximal ideal of r and r s is a b extension 2 assume that r s is a b extension and that r r is an i extension let q suppr s r and set p q r so that p suppr s r supp s r the assumption gives that p is contained in a unique maximal ideal m of r but r r being an i extension there is a unique n max r lying above m then n is the unique maximal ideal of r containing q and r s is a b extension 3 obvious since supp t r supp s r 10 g picavet and m picavet remark 3 6 1 let r s be an fcp extension if r is local i e r s is unbranched then r s is chained according to 13 theorem 6 10 and then a b extension by proposition 3 4 an extension r s is said almost unbranched if each t r r is a local ring 2 the i extension hypothesis of proposition 3 5 2 cannot be sup pressed we now exhibit an example of an fcp b extension r s such that r s is not a b extension let r s be an extension such that r m is a two dimensional local ring with r r minimal decomposed so that r r is not an i extension set max r m 1 m 2 assume moreover that r s is a pru fer extension of length 2 and that there exists p supp s r p 6 m since p 6 supp r r this implies that there is a unique q spec r ly ing over p in particular we have p supp s r which leads to q suppr s r if q m 1 m 2 then r s is not a b extension it is enough to consider a two dimensional pru fer domain r with ex actly two height 2 maximal ideals n 1 and n 2 both of then containing the unique height 1 prime ideal p of r such situation exists see 20 theorem 3 1 this also happens when r r satisfies going down in this case since p m with m 1 m 2 lying over m there exist q 1 q 2 spec r lying over p and such that qi mi for i 1 2 but r r being minimal we get rp rp so that there is a unique q spec r lying over p giving q q 1 q 2 which leads to q m 1 m 2 we meet this situation in the following example example 3 7 consider the ring of integer valued polynomials t int z it is known that t is a two dimensional pru fer domain whose prime ideals are of two types 7 proposition v 2 7 and 21 example page 293 set q x x 2 x p q x where p is an odd prime number then 7 exercise 12 page 116 says that pq qq x t is a height one prime ideal of t lying above 0 in z and contained in two distinct maximal ideals m 1 and m 2 of t lying both above pz set t m 1 m 2 which is a multiplicatively closed subset and t t q pq and mi m i for i 1 2 then t is a two dimensional pru fer domain with two maximal ideals m 1 and m 2 moreover t tm 1 tm 2 where vi tmi is a two dimensional valuation domain with maximal ideal ni mivi for i 1 2 and q is a prime ideal of t contained inm 1 andm 2 we have ni z mi z pz and vi ni t mi z pz for i 1 2 set m m 1 m 2 and r z m which gives m z pz it follows that r m t mi z pz for i 1 2 so that r t is a minimal decomposed extension with r m a local domain moreover since t is a pru fer domain q splitting ring extensions 11 is the unique non maximal prime ideal of height one contained in m 1 andm 2 giving that tq is a one dimensional valuation domain setting p q r this yields that p is the unique non maximal prime ideal of height one contained in m as spec t 0 q m 1 m 2 we get the following commutative diagram where k q x v 1 r t tq k v 2 we obtain that suppt k t q m 1 m 2 and suppr k r p m at last t is the integral closure of r in k giving that r k is a b extension and t k is not a b extension since the prime ideal q of t is in suppt k t and is contained in two maximal ideals of t as we said in proposition 3 1 an fcp integral extension is a b extension let r s be an fcp extension if r s is a b extension by proposition 3 5 we deduce that r s is a b extension in the fol lowing we characterize fcp pru fer b extensions recall 13 theorem 6 3 that an fcp pru fer extension has fip at the same time we take the opportunity to get some additional results about the cardinality of the set of intermediate rings in fcp pru fer extensions after those obtained in 13 and 14 we give also results generalizing some results that ayache and jarboui get for extensions of integral domains in 3 the following proposition allows us to generalize 13 theorem 6 10 and makes 3 corollary 2 7 valid for an arbitrary fcp pru fer exten sion although the context of ayache jarboui s result seems different from ours they are in fact the same but our proof is different according to 13 proposition 6 9 an integrally closed extension r s has fcp if and only if it is a normal pair such that supp s r is finite if and only if it is an fcp pru fer extension we recall the following definition and notation a poset x is called a tree if x 1 x 2 x 3 in x implies that x 1 and x 2 are comparable with respect to a subset y of x is called an antichain if no two distinct elements of y are comparable let r s be an fcp pru fer extension set m msupp s r for each k nm let k be the set of all antichains of supp s r that have cardinality k proposition 3 8 let r s be an fcp pru fer extension whence fip the following statements are equivalent 1 r s is chained 2 there exists a unique t r s such that r t is minimal 12 g picavet and m picavet 3 supp s r is linearly ordered 4 r s 1 supp s r if one of the above conditions is verified then r s is a b extension proof 1 2 obvious 2 3 set m c r t max r where t is the unique ele ment of r s such that r t is minimal we claim that msupp s r m assume there exists m msupp s r m according to 27 lemma 1 8 there exists t r s t 6 t such that r t is minimal with m c r t a contradiction it follows that msupp s r m and p m for any p supp s r by 14 proposition 4 2 b supp s r is a tree and then is linearly ordered since it has only one maximal element 3 4 we keep notation of 14 theorem 4 3 and proposition 4 2 with m msupp s r then we have msupp s r 1 so that m 1 and 1 supp s r because 1 supp s r since any antichain of supp s r has only one element by 14 theorem 4 3 we get r s 1 supp s r 4 1 because supp s r r s by 13 proposition 6 12 so that r s 1 r s and there is a unique maximal chain in r s the last statement follows from proposition 3 4 as a second proposition we now give a generalization to arbitrary rings of ayache jarboui s result 3 theorem 3 1 our proof is com pletely different proposition 3 9 let r s be an fcp pru fer extension then the following conditions are equivalent 1 r s is locally minimal 2 supp s r max r 3 r s 2 supp s r 4 r s is a boolean fip b extension proof 1 2 since r s is an fcp pru fer extension so is rm sm for any m supp s r it follows from 13 proposition 6 12 that rm sm supp sm rm for any m supp s r then r s is locally minimal for any m supp s r rm sm 1 supp sm rm for any m supp s r supp sm rm mrm supp s r max r 1 3 by corollary 3 2 because supp s r max r 3 2 assume that r s 2 supp s r we keep the notation of 14 theorem 4 3 set r supp s r and n msupp s r splitting ring extensions 13 so that r n it follows that r s 2 r 1 1 r r k 0 c k r 1 r k 1 c k r but c k r is the number of subsets of supp s r whose cardinality is k moreover for each k 0 n we have k ckr since 14 theorem 4 3 gives that r s 1 n i 1 i we get that r k 1 c k r n k 1 k n k 1 c k r it follows that r n giving msupp s r supp s r and any element of supp s r is a maximal ideal of r hence supp s r max r 1 4 r s is a boolean fip b extension by corollary 3 2 4 2 by 28 proposition 3 21 because r s is a boolean fip pru fer extension the next result characterizes fcp pru fer b extensions and general izes the ayache jarboui s result 3 theorem 3 3 theorem 3 10 let r s be an fcp pru fer extension whence fip msupp s r m 1 mn and p 1 pr the set of minimal elements of supp s r then the following statements are equivalent 1 r s is a b extension 2 r s n i 1 rmi smi 3 v p is linearly ordered for each minimal element p of supp s r 4 r s n i 1 2 ht mi pji where pji is the only minimal element of supp s r contained in mi 5 supp s r n i 1 1 ht mi pji where pji is the only minimal element of supp s r contained in mi proof first by 14 proposition 4 2 b which says that supp s r is a tree eachmi contains only one pj for i nn let msupp s r p 1 pr be the map defined by mi pji where pji is the only minimal element of supp s r contained inmi the map r s n i 1 rmi smi defined by t tm 1 tmn is injective by 13 theorem 3 6 1 2 since is injective 1 3 assume that there is a minimal element p of supp s r such that v p is not linearly ordered there exist p 1 p 2 v p which are incomparable it follows that they are not contained in a same maximal ideal of r because supp s r is a tree so we may assume that there exist m 1 m 2 v p msupp s r with m 1 6 m 2 a contradiction by proposition 3 1 since is bijective then v p is linearly ordered and this holds for each minimal element p of supp s r 3 1 assume that v p is linearly ordered for each minimal element p of supp s r then r q is local for each q supp s r and proposition 3 1 shows that is bijective 14 g picavet and m picavet 2 4 let i nn since rmi is local we have rmi smi chained according to 13 theorem 6 10 moreover rmi smi 1 supprmi smi rmi and supprmi smi rmi is linearly ordered by proposition 3 8 its smallest element is of the form pjirmi where pji mi then supprmi smi rmi 1 ht mi pji it follows that rmi smi 2 ht mi pji and 4 r s n i 1 2 ht mi pji n i 1 rmi smi 2 3 5 by 14 proposition 4 2 c rj 1 vr pj is a partition of supp s r it follows that supp s r r j 1 vr pj since is surjective we get that r n for each j nr set mj 1 mj sj vr pj msupp s r 1 pj and r j 1 sj k 1 1 ht mj k pj a as supp s r is a tree there do not exist j j nr j 6 j such that mj k mj k for any k k nsj nsj then a n i 1 1 ht mi pji where pji mi and because each mi appears one and only one time in a for j nr we have vr pj sj k 1 1 ht mj k pj with equality if and only if sj 1 since pj is counted in ht mj k pj for eachmj k 1 pj it follows that vr pj sj k 1 1 ht mj k pj if and only if pj is contained in a unique maximal ideal mj k if and only if vr pj is linearly ordered because supp s r is a tree now supp s r r j 1 vr pj r j 1 sj k 1 1 ht mj k pj a but a n i 1 1 ht mi pji to conclude 5 supp s r a vr pj sj k 1 1 ht mj k pj for each minimal element pj of supp s r vr pj is linearly ordered for each minimal element pj of supp s r 3 4 general properties of splitters given a ring extension r s and t r s it is easy to see that msuppr s r msuppr t r msuppr s t the case when this equation defines a partition of suppr s r has a great interest because we will show that in some contexts we can reduce our results to this situation in the following we denote by xc the complement of a subset x of msuppr s r in msuppr s r lemma 4 1 let r s be a ring extension assume that there is some t r s such that msupp s t msupp t r then t is the unique t r s such that msupp s t msupp s t and msupp t r msupp t r proof setx msupp t r and y xc so that y msupp s t let t r s be such that msupp t r x and msupp s t y since x y and msupp s r x y we get tm t m sm splitting ring extensions 15 for any m x and tm t m rm for any m y moreover since rm tm t m sm for any m max r x y it follows that t t definition 4 2 if r s is an extension and t r s we say that the extension splits at t if msupp s t msupp t r in fact if r s is an extension and t r s we have obvi ously msupp s t msupp t r if and only if supp s t supp t r that is the reason why we work only with maximal ideals the following proposition gives a first example of a split extension section 6 is devoted to almost pru fer extensions proposition 4 3 26 proposition 4 16 and 24 proposition 3 6 let r s be an fcp extension the following statements are equivalent 1 r s is an almost pru fer extension 2 r s splits at r 3 r s splits at r 4 r r r and s rr 5 there exists u r s such that r r u and s ru if these conditions hold r is the only u r s satisfying 5 definition 4 4 letr s be a ring extension andx msuppr s r we say that an element t of r s is a splitter of the extension at x if x msuppr t r and x c msuppr s t clearly such a split ter splits the extension and each element that splits an extension is a splitter remark 4 5 the fcp hypothesis on r s is necessary in propo sition 4 3 in 13 remark 2 9 c we give the following example let r m be a one dimensional valuation domain with quotient field s and set t s x x 2 s x where x is the class of x in t we get that r s and r r sx but neither r nor r are splitters since msuppr t r msuppr r r msuppr t r msuppr r r m in fact according to 26 theorem 4 6 a quasi pru fer extension r s is an almost pru fer extension if and only if r is the complement of r and according to 26 corollary 4 7 if r s is an almost pru fer extension then r s splits at r if and only if r s splits at r according to lemma 4 1 a splitter at x is unique and we will denote it by x it follows that if the extension splits at t then t x where x msuppr t r we observe that if x msupp s r 16 g picavet and m picavet then msupp s r s and if x then r we say that r and s are trivial splitters the following theorem shows that for an fcp b extension r s and for any x msupp s r the splitter of the extension at x always exists in fact it is a new characterization of b extensions a precise study of splitters in such extensions is the subject of section 5 theorem 4 6 let r s be an fcp extension then r s is a b extension if and only if for any x msupp s r the splitter of the extension at x exists proof let x msupp s r and set y xc assume that r s is a b extension so that the map r s m msupp s r rm sm defined by t tm m msupp s r is bijective in particular there exists a unique t r s such that tm sm for each m x and tm rm for each m y this implies in particular that msupp t r x and msupp s t y since x y it follows that t is the splitter of r s at x conversely assume that the splitter of r s at x exists for any x msupp s r and assume that r s is not a b extension then there exists p supp s r which is contained in two max imal ideals m 1 m 2 of r obviously m 1 m 2 msupp s r set x m 1 and y x c so that m 2 y and let t x it follows that msupp t r x and msupp s t y let ri n i 0 be a maximal chain of r s containing t so that t rk for some k nn 1 since p supp s r there is some i nn 1 such that p c ri ri 1 r then p suppr ri 1 ri which implies that m 1 m 2 msuppr ri 1 ri if i k then ri ri 1 r t and m 2 msuppr t r a contradiction a similar contradiction holds if i k to conclude r s is a b extension corollary 4 7 let r s be an fcp extension assume that there exists x msupp s r such that the splitter of the extension at x does not exist then there exists some p supp s r contained in two distinct ideals of msupp s r proof according to theorem 4 6 there exists x msupp s r such that the splitter of the extension at x does not exist if and only if r s is not a b extension which is equivalent to there exists some p supp s r such that r p is not local by proposition 3 1 that is there exists some p supp s r contained in two distinct ideals of msupp s r when an fcp extension r s splits at some t r s we get a bijection between r s and r t t s which allows to get a general splitting ring extensions 17 formula about cardinalities of set of intermediary rings in case of fip extensions theorem 4 8 let r s be an fcp extension that splits at t and set x msupp t r then the following statements hold 1 there is an order isomorphism r s r t t s defined by v v t v t 2 t has a unique complement t o which is the splitter xc and satisfies t t o tt o 3 msupp t r msupp s t o and msupp s t msupp t o r 4 if r s is an fip extension r s r t t s holds proof 1 is 24 lemma 3 7 for the bijective property the condition about the order is obvious considering the product order on r t t s 2 the existence of t o comes from the fact that there exists a unique u r s such that u r s so that r u t and s ut shows that u is the complement t o of t since msupp s r msupp t o r msupp s t o by we get t o m rm for any m x and gives t o m sm for any m y xc it follows that tm t o m tm t o m sm for any m supp s r leads to t t o tt o at last x msupp s t o and y msupp t o r shows that r s splits at t o in particular msupp s r msupp t r msupp t o r since msupp s r x y 3 we have just proved that x msupp s t o msupp t r and y msupp t o r msupp s t 4 comes from 1 corollary 4 9 let r s be an fcp ring extension split at t 1 ut v t implies u v for any u v r t o 2 u t v t implies u v for any u v t o s proof 1 u v r t o implies u t v t r since t o t r applying the isomorphism of theorem 4 8 we get u v 2 u v t o s implies ut v t s since t ot s the same isomorphism gives u v proposition 4 10 let r s be an fcp extension then any split ter is trivial if r is a local ring proof as msupp s r 1 since r 6 s we see that r and s are the only splitters 18 g picavet and m picavet we recall that a ring extension r s is called pinched at t r s if r s r t t s we will see in section 7 that when an extension r s is pinched at t r s then r and s are the only splitters a simple situation is given by the following crosswise exchange lemma which allowed us to develop the properties of split fcp ex tensions proposition 4 11 ce 13 lemma 2 7 let r s and s t be minimal extensions m c r s n c s t and p n r suppose also that p 6 m then there exists s r t such that r s is minimal of the same type as s t and s t is minimal of the same type as r s moreover for any such s we have r t r s s t analysing the hypotheses and the statement we see that msupp s r m msupp t s p so that msupp s r msupp t s s so and r t r s s t by the map defined in theorem 4 8 1 remark 4 12 1 in 18 proposition 1 6 page 88 the equation t v tv of theorem 4 8 holds for arbitrary t v r s when r s is a pru fer extension moreover in this case if t has a complement this complement is unique by 18 theorem 7 11 and remarks 7 12 p 132 in fact these authors define a complement for an r submodule i of s containing r as an r submodule j of s such that i j s and i j r their notation io denotes the polar j of i as an r submodule of s such that i j r and every r submodule k of s such that i k r is contained in j and when a complement of i exists it coincides with its polar in the following result t o denotes the complement of t as defined in section 3 and coincide with the complement defined by 18 proposition 4 13 holds for an arbitrary fcp extension and is similar to 18 propositions 7 2 and 7 3 p 130 which is satisfied for pru fer extensions 2 let r s be an fcp extension that splits at t so that t x for some x msupp s r it follows that for any m msupp s r either tm sm when m x or tm rm when m xc then v rm is the only complement of tm in case and v sm is the only complement of tm in case in both cases we recover that tm o t o m proposition 4 13 let r s be an fcp extension that splits at t then the following properties hold 1 t o is the largest v r s such that v t r 2 t o x s t rx r splitting ring extensions 19 proof as in theorem 4 8 we set x msupp t r and y xc then tm sm for any m x and t o m sm for any m y 1 obviously t o t r let v r s be such that v t r so that vm tm vm rm t o m for any m x moreover vm sm t o m for any m y giving v t o hence t o is the largest v r s such that v t r 2 set w x s t rx r and let x w so that t rx r if m x then gives tm rm x 1 rm but tm sm yields x 1 rm t o m if m y then t o m sm so that x 1 t o m whence x t o conversely if x t o then rx t o which implies that t rx t t o r proposition 4 14 let r s be an fcp extension that splits at t then the following properties hold 1 the map 1 r t o t s defined by 1 v v t is an order isomorphism 2 the map r t r t o r s defined by v w vw is an order isomorphism proof let r s r t t s be the bijection defined by v v t v t as in theorem 4 8 1 let v w r t o be such that 1 v 1 w v t wt since v t w t r because t t o r we get v w so that v w and 1 is injective let w t s there exists v r s such that v r w so that r v t andw v t letm supp s r supp t r supp t o r by theorem 4 8 then rm vm tm ifm supp t r then tm sm and rm t o m lead to vm t o m if m supp t o r then vm sm t o m it follows that v t o giv ing v r t o and 1 is surjective hence bijective the property concerning the order is obvious 2 using 1 and localizing at any m msupp s r we may remark that id 1 since and id 1 are order isomorphisms so is remark 4 15 we will see in corollary 6 2 that theorem 4 8 has a con verse when taking t r for an fcp extension r s but for some t r s we may have a bijection r s r t t s defined by u u t ut even if msuppr s t msuppr t r 6 consider the following situation let r t s be a composite of two minimal extensions where r m is a quasilocal ring r t is decomposed and t s is ramified such a situation exists in the 20 g picavet and m picavet following example see also 13 remark 2 9 b take r k a field t k 2 and s k k z z 2 where z is an indeterminate so that r t is minimal decomposed with r s 0 and t s is minimal ramified with t s k 0 max t in view of 13 lemma 2 8 there exists t r s such that r t is mini mal ramified and t s is minimal decomposed since r s 4 and r s is of length 2 because infra integral 13 lemma 5 4 it follows from 27 theorem 6 1 5 that r s r t t s in fact t k z z 2 we have the following commutative diagram t r s t it follows that r s 4 r t t s and r s r t t s defined by u u t ut is a bijection indeed we have r r t t t t t r s and s t s to end msuppr s t msuppr t r 0 6 5 splitters in b extensions theorem 4 6 shows that the splitter ofx exists for anyx msupp s r if and only if r s is a b extension we now examine in this section b extensions theorem 4 8 has a converse in the pru fer case proposition 5 1 let r s be an fcp pru fer extension and t r s be such that t o exists then there exists x msupp s r such that t x proof recall that for a pru fer extension r s and any t r s if t has a complement this complement is unique and is denoted by t o see remark 4 12 we have msupp s r msupp t r msupp s t assume that msupp t r msupp s t 6 and let m msupp t r msupp s t so that tm 6 rm sm since r t t o and s tt o this gives rm tm t o m and sm tm t o m with tm 6 rm sm but rm sm is chained according to 13 theorem 6 10 so that tm and t o m are comparable assume that tm t o m then gives rm tm a contradiction if t o m tm then gives sm tm a contradiction to conclude msupp t r msupp s t and t x where x msupp t r proposition 5 2 let r s be an fcp extension splitting ring extensions 21 1 if the extension is chained it is crucial 2 conversely if the extension is pru fer and crucial it is chained proof 1 assume that msupp s r 1 and letm m msupp s r m 6 m according to 27 lemma 1 8 there exist t u r s such that r t and r u are minimal with c r t m and c r u m so that r s is not chained then 1 is proved 2 assume that r s is pru fer and msupp s r 1 let p supp s r and m v p max r so that m msupp s r then there is a unique maximal ideal m of r containing p it follows from proposition 3 1 that r s is a b extension in particular there is an order isomorphism r s rm sm but rm is a local ring and rm sm is pru fer whence chained by 13 theorem 6 10 and so is r s remark 5 3 1 we cannot extend proposition 5 1 to an arbitrary extension take for instance an infra integralm crucial extension r s such that sr 6 r s and m r s then 27 theorem 6 1 5 shows that r s is a length 2 extension with 4 elements r s r sr u s where u sr o while m msupp sr r msupp s sr 2 moreover for an arbitrary fcp extension r s with t u r s such that u is a complement of t this complement is not always unique consider for instance the following situation 16 proposition 7 1 r t is a minimal inert extension r u is a minimal de composed extension and assume that the composite s tu exists then r t s is a maximal chain and there exists a maximal finite chain r u v s of length 3 then t is the complement of both u and v corollary 5 4 let r s be an fcp b extension if t is a split ter then t msupp t r and if x msupp s r then x msupp x r proof let t be a splitter so that there exists some x msupp s r such that msupp t r x and then t x msupp t r now let x msupp s r and set t x by definition of the splitter at x we have msupp t r x msupp x r corollary 5 5 let r s be an fcp b extension then for any x msupp s r the following statements hold 1 r x u r s msupp u r x 2 x s u r s msupp s u x 22 g picavet and m picavet proof set t x for any m x we have tm sm and for any m 6 x we have tm rm 1 let u r t then um rm for any m 6 x so that msupp u r x conversely assume that msupp u r x for some u r s then for any m 6 x we have m 6 msupp u r so that tm rm um since tm sm for any m x we have um tm so that r x u r s msupp u r x 2 let u r s since um sm for any m x if and only if msupp s u x we get that um tm for any m x if and only if msupp s u x but rm tm um for any m 6 x it follows that u t s if and only if msupp s u x so that x s u r s msupp s u x let r s be an fcp b extension if x m for some m msupp s r we say that x is an elementary splitter and write m x for such a splitter r m is m crucial if p supp s r max r we cannot define an elementary splitter associated to p because there does not exists some t r s such that t p that is supp t r p in fact for any m max r v p we have m supp t r a contradiction in example 3 7 we proved that msuppt k t m 1 m 2 msuppt k tq so that there does not exist any u t k which is the splitter of t k at any mi for i 1 2 the reason why is that t k is not a b extension corollary 5 5 has the following application to elementary splitters corollary 5 6 let r s be an fcp b extension andm msupp s r then r m u r s r u is m crucial and m is a minimal element in the set of non trivial splitters of r s proof set t m according to corollary 5 5 we get that r t u r s msupp u r m it follows that u r t msupp u r m r u is m crucial assume there exists some 6 x msupp s r such that r v x t then the previous result shows that r v is m crucial so that x m and v t for an extension r s and a multiplicatively closed subset of r knebusch and zhang define r x s sx r for some s 18 definition 10 page 18 a definition reminiscent of large quotient rings in case r p for some p spec r then r is replaced with r p in this case r p is the pullback of the ring morphisms s sp and rp sp in particular r p s if and only splitting ring extensions 23 if p 6 supp s r if t r s we write r p t x t sx r for some s r p and drop t when t s we may compare the following proposition with 19 theorem 1 8 page 4 saying that for a pru fer extension r s and some t r s such that t o exists the following holds t o r m m t r where t r is the set of maximal ideals m of r which are t regular that is such that mt t in fact t r supp t r see proposition 5 8 proposition 5 7 let r s be an fcp extension such that the splitter at xexists for some x msupp s r and set r m x the following results hold 1 r x c and is the unique complement of x 2 x r m m x c assume in addition that r s is integral with conductor i and let m msupp s r 3 r m r is an m i primary submodule of s r and m r r m r m msupp s r m 6 m is the reduced primary decomposition of m r into primary r i submodules of s r proof set t x which has a unique complement t o xc by theorem 4 8 r m xc v r and v r then tm sm t o m sm tm rm and t o m rm for any m x and any m xc 1 let x t o then x 1 t o m rm for any m x so that x 1 r and x r then t o r conversely let x r then there exists s such that sx r in particular s 6 m for any m x so that x 1 rm t o m for any m x as t o m sm for any m xc we get that x 1 t o m for any m msupp s r and then x t o to conclude t o r 2 by 1 we get r x now let x s then x r there exists s such that sx r there exists s 6 m for any m xc such that sx r x r m for anym x c x r m m xc then r r m m x c 3 set i r s and r r i since r s is an integral fcp extension r s is a b extension it follows from 13 theo rem 4 2 that r is an artinian ring and in particular a noetherian ring moreover s r is an r module as s r m r m r and m r according to 6 corollaire 1 of proposition 7 page 136 we get that ass s r m msupp s r m m where ass s r m is the set of associated prime ideals of s r m see 6 de finition 1 page 131 then r m r is anm i primary submodule of s r by 6 proposition 1 and de finition 1 page 139 24 g picavet and m picavet hence the equality m r r m r m msupp s r m 6 m of 2 is a reduced primary decomposition into distinct primary r i submodules of s r the following proposition generalizes a result gotten for fcp pru fer extensions 13 remark 6 14 b if r s is pru fer supp s r can be characterized as follows proposition 5 8 let r s be a pru fer extension and p spec r then p supp s r if and only if ps s in which case r p is a valuation subring of s if p 6 supp s r then r p s proof let p spec r since r s is a pru fer extension it is a flat epimorphism equivalently weakly surjective by 18 theorem 4 4 page 42 then p supp s r rp 6 sp ps s if these conditions are satisfied then r p is a valuation subring of s 18 proposition 5 1 p 46 corollary 5 9 let r s be a ring extension then the following statements hold 1 r is an intersection of valuation subrings of r 2 assume in addition that r s has fcp then r is an inter section of valuation subrings of s 3 assume in addition that r s is a pru fer extension then any splitter is an intersection of valuation subrings of s proof 1 comes from 18 remark 5 5 p 50 and proposition 5 1 p 46 since r r is pru fer even if r r r r is pru fer 2 if r s has fcp then r s is pru fer the result comes from the previous reference 3 if r s is a pru fer extension then any splitter is an intersection of valuation subrings of s by propositions 5 7 and 5 8 in 28 we introduce the following sets if r s has fcp we set t t r s r t crucial and tm t t r t m crucial for some m msupp s r the sets tm give a partition of t associated to the equivalence relation r on t defined by t r t if and only if supp t r supp t r the next result improves 28 proposition 2 16 where we get that in case r s has fip and for any m msupp s r the set tm has a greatest element s m t tm t in fact s m is a splitter when r s is an fcp b extension proposition 5 10 if r s is an fcp b extension andm msupp s r then s m m so that r m tm splitting ring extensions 25 proof set u m by definition of the splitter at m we get msupp u r m and msupp s u msupp s r m then u tm so that u s m moreover um sm and um rm for any m msupp s r m let t tm it follows that supp t r m from which we infer that tm rm um for any m msupp s r m and tm sm um then t u which implies s m u to conclude u s m and tm r u ob viously any t r u satisfies 6 msupp t r msupp u r m yielding msupp t r m therefore t tm and the last equality holds proposition 5 11 let r s be an fcp b extension any splitter is a product in a unique way of elementary splitters of r s for any x msupp s r we have x m x m in particular s m msupp s r m moreover for m msupp s r there existsx msupp s r such that m x if and only ifm x proof let x m 1 mn msupp s r we may assume that n 1 because for n 1 the result is obvious setting t x we have by definition of the splitter msupp t r x and msupp s t msupp s r x for any mi x set ti mi and u n i 1 ti let m msupp s r x msupp s t then tm rm ti m for any i nn so that tm um if m x there exists some i nn such that m mi then tm sm and ti m sm since um n j 1 j 6 i tj m ti m sm we deduce that tm um to conclude t u the uniqueness of the product is obvious con sidering the relation x m x m since any different product of elementary splitters would lead to a different support and then to a different splitter as s is a splitter by definition 4 4 the last equality is obvious now assume that an elementary splitter u m is contained in a splitter t x we have msupp t r x and msupp u r m with u t this implies msupp u r msupp t r and then m x conversely m x implies m x by the previous equality corollary 5 12 let r s be an fcp b extension and x y msupp s r the following properties hold 1 x y x y 2 x y x y 3 x y x y 26 g picavet and m picavet 4 if m m msupp s r m 6 m then m m r proof set x y m 1 mk x m 1 mk mk 1 mn and y m 1 mk m k 1 m m 1 assume that x y so that n k according to proposition 5 11 we get x k i 1 mi k i 1 mi m j k 1 m j y conversely assume that x y then msupp x r msupp y r so that x y by corollary 5 4 2 by 1 we get x y x y set t x y and z msupp t r since t x we have z msupp x r x in the same way z y so that z x y assume that z 6 x y then let m x y z since m 6 z msupp t r we get rm tm butm x y implies that m x y t and then rm m m tm a contradiction it follows that x y x y 3 we use the notation of 1 then x y m 1 mk mk 1 mn m k 1 m m and x y k i 1 mi n j k 1 mj m j k 1 m j x y 4 since m 6 m then m m the results follows from 2 since r here is an example illustrating proposition 5 11 example 5 13 29 example 3 16 let k l be a radicial i e purely inseparable field extension of degree p 2 and k be the only proper subalgebra of l set r k 2 r 1 k x x 2 k r 2 k k r 3 k l s k x x 2 l m 0 k and n k 0 then max r m n with m 6 n we proved that r s r r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 r 3 s with the following commutative diagram r 1 r r 1 r 2 r 2 r 3 s moreover r r 1 is a minimal extension with c r r 1 m r r 2 is a minimal extension with c r r 2 n and r 2 r 3 is a minimal extension with c r 2 r 3 n so that msupp s r m n msupp r 1 r m and msupp r 3 r n it was also proved that r 1 m sm and sn r 3 n so that msupp s r 1 n and msupp s r 3 m then r 1 m and r 3 n with r 3 the complement of r 1 we recover the relation of proposition 5 11 m n s the following lemma is need in the sequel splitting ring extensions 27 lemma 5 14 let r s be an m crucial integral fcp extension and i r s there exists some positive integer n such that mn i proof since r s is an integral fcp extension r i is an artinian ring by 13 theorem 4 2 moreover since r s is an m crucial extension msupp s r m so that m is the only maximal ideal of r containing i then r i is an artinian local ring whose maximal ideal is m i so that there exists some positive integer n such that m i n 0 whence mn i corollary 5 15 let r s be an fcp b extension i an ideal shared by r and s x msupp s r a multiplicatively closed subset of r and y m x m the following properties hold 1 r i s i is an fcp b extension 2 setting r r i s s i and x m i m x we have x msupp s r and r s x x i 3 if r s is integral then x y r s y where y m m y if m for any m x then 4 and 5 hold 4 r s is an fcp b extension 5 setting x m m x we have x msupp s r and r s x x proof 1 comes from 13 proposition 3 7 for the fcp property and from proposition 3 1 for the b extension property 2 since i r s we get that i m for anym msupp s r set m m i for such an m then rm im r m and sm im s m so that m msupp s r giving x msupp s r more over corollary 5 5 shows that r r s x t r s msupp t r x but any t r s is of the form t i for some t r s so that msupp t r x is equivalent to msupp t r x giving r s x x i 3 let m x be such that m 6 and set u m according to lemma 5 14 there exists some positive integer n such that mn r u let x m then xn r u so that r u m by proposition 5 11 we have x m x m m y m m x y m which leads to x m y m m x y m m y m y 4 comes from 11 proposition 3 1 for the fcp property and from proposition 3 1 for the b extension property since the maximal ideals of r are the m for any m max r such that m 5 let m x for some m x then rm 6 sm but rm r m and sm s m leads to m msupp s r 28 g picavet and m picavet so that x msupp s r as in 2 corollary 5 5 shows that r r s x t r s msupp t r x but any t r s is of the form t for some t r s so that msupp t r x is equivalent to msupp t r x and then r s x x proposition 5 16 let r s be an fcp b extension and t r s then r t x r s x t for any x msupp t r proof let m msupp t r then rm 6 tm sm so that m msupp s r set u r s m and v r t m which exists since r t is an fcp b extension by proposition 3 5 3 then rm 6 vm tm sm um which gives vm tm um let m msupp s r m 6 m then rm vm um gives vm tm um it follows that r t m r s m t now consider x msupp t r a subset of msupp s r ac cording to proposition 5 11 we have x m x m we also have r t x m x r t m which implies by the first part r t x m r t m m r s m t m r s m m tm for any m x but r s x t m r s x m tm r s m m tm r t x m then r t x m r s x t m for any m x if m msupp s r x then rm r t x m r s x m r s x m tm r s x t m to conclude r t x r s x t proposition 5 17 let r s be an fcp b extension withmsupp s r m 1 mn and xk m 1 mk for each k nn assume n 1 then 1 xk 1 xk mk 1 for each k nn 1 2 xk n k 1 is a

permu tation of 1 n proof 1 let k nn 1 according to proposition 5 11 we have xk 1 k 1 i 1 mi mk 1 k i 1 mi xk mk 1 2 by 1 we get that xk xk 1 moreover mk 1 6 xk then 13 lemma 2 4 yields that mk 1 xk is the unique maxi mal ideal of xk lying over mk 1 it follows from the relations mk 1 xk 1 msupp xk 1 r msupp xk r mk 1 that mk 1 xk msupp xk xk 1 xk 1 xk giving that xk xk 1 is an mk 1 xk crucial extension splitting ring extensions 29 3 to each permutation i 1 in of 1 n we can build a unique chain xik then there are n such chains each chain corresponding to a permutation of 1 n a ring extension r s is called arithmetic if it is locally chained theorem 5 18 let r s be an fcp extension the following con ditions are equivalent 1 any element of r s is a splitter 2 r s is locally minimal 3 r s is an fip b extension such that r s 2 msupp s r 4 r s is a boolean and arithmetic fip extension proof 1 msupp t r msupp s t for any t r s by the definition of a splitter which is equivalent to r s is a locally minimal extension by 28 theorem 2 27 2 3 by corollary 3 2 2 3 4 by 28 corollary 3 6 and 4 2 by the same reference corollary 5 19 let r s be an fcp b extension then for any m msupp s r the map m r m rm sm defined by m t tm is an order isomorphism proof letm msupp s r according to 28 proposition 2 22 and proposition 5 10 m is surjective and obviously a respecting order map let t t r m be such that m t m t so that tm t m but t t r m implies that tm rm t m for any m msupp s r m 6 m then t t and m is bijective it follows that m is an order isomorphism in light of corollary 5 19 checking that an fcp b extension satisfies some type of property which is preserved by localization and globaliza tion the following proposition shows that we can limit to verify this property only for crucial extensions we say that an extension r s satisfies a local global property p in case the extension satisfies p if and only if rm sm satisfies p for any m msupp s r proposition 5 20 let p be a local global property then an fcp b extension r s satisfies p if and only if r m satisfies p for any m msupp s r proof for each m msupp s r we have msupp m r m by corollary 5 4 so that m m sm let p be a local global property then r s satisfies p if and only if rm sm satisfies p for any m msupp s r if and only if rm m m satisfies 30 g picavet and m picavet p for any m msupp s r if and only if r m satisfies p for any m msupp s r since m m sm and m m rm for any m msupp s r m 6 m the next proposition shows that some splitters are related to clo sures associated to a specified property of ring extensions let p be a property concerning a class c of ring extensions stable under subextensions i e r s in c and u v r s imply u v in c we say that p admits a closure in c if the following conditions i ii and iii hold for any extension r s in c i for any tower of extensions r u s then r s has p if and only if r u and u s have p ii there exists a largest subextension t r s such that r t has p iii no subextension u v of t s has p according to 25 the paragraph after theorem 1 4 such a t is unique is called the p closure of r in s and is denoted by rp some instances are the separable closure in the class of algebraic field exten sions the seminormalization and the t closure proposition 5 21 let p be a local global property of ring extensions admitting a p closure in a class c of ring extensions let r s be an fcp b extension which belongs to c let t rp be its p closure and set x m msupp s r rm sm satisfies p then x t with equality if and only if r s splits at t if this last condition holds then t o is the least subextension w r s such that w s has p proof set v x and y xc for each m x we have vm sm so that rm sm vm satisfies p for each m y we have vm rm so that rm vm satisfies p then r v satisfies p leading to v t if v t then t x is a splitter and r s splits at t conversely assume that r s splits at t and set x msupp t r so that t x if v t it follows that x x by corollary 5 12 let m x x then rm vm and tm sm so that rm sm satisfies p a contradiction since m 6 x then we get v t assume that t v x for m x we have t o m rm and tm sm so that t o m sm satisfies p and for m y we have t o m sm it follows that t o s satisfies p at last let w r s be such that w s has p for m x we have t o m rm so that t o m wm splitting ring extensions 31 assume that tw 6 s since t w tw s this implies that tw s has at the same time p because so has w s and has not p because so has not t s a contradiction it follows that tw s leading to tmwm sm wm t o m for m y to conclude t o w then t o is the least subextension w r s such that w s has p we give more details about a result from 13 proposition 5 22 let r s be a seminormal infra integral fcpm crucial extension set n r s then m r s vs m n 1 and s m r m n 1 proof since r s is an integral fcp m crucial extension it is a b extension so that there is an order isomorphism r s rm sm then vs m max sm and n rm sm it follows that we can assume that r m is a local ring according to proposition 2 4 and 13 lemma 5 4 r s m is an intersection of the maximal ideals of s max s n 1 and s m r m n 1 by the chinese remainder theorem since r s is infra integral 6 integral closure and pru fer hull as splitters the following theorem is a first application of theorem 4 8 to almost pru fer extensions because an almost pru fer fcp extension r s splits at r and r by the way we generalize a result gotten by ayache in 1 theorem 20 for extensions of integral domains theorem 6 1 let r s be an fcp extension there is an order isomorphism r s t t r r r s t t almost pru fer defined by t t r rt for each t r s in par ticular if r s has fip then r s r r r s proof let t t r r r s then r is also the integral closure t of t in t and in s let t r s and set t t r and t rt then t t t and t t r r r s assume first that t t so that t t r which implies that t r and suppt r t suppt t r it follows that t t is almost pru fer assume now that t 6 t applying proposition 4 3 to the extension t t we get that t t is almost pru fer therefore we can define r s t t r r r s t t almost pru fer by t t r rt for each t r s let t t r r r s and assume that t t is almost pru fer in view of theorem 4 8 applied to the extension t t 32 g picavet and m picavet there exists t t t r s such that t t t t t t t r rt hence is a surjection now let t 1 t 2 r s be such that t 1 t 2 t t which implies that t 1 t 2 t t another use of theorem 4 8 applied to the extension t t gives that t 1 t 2 so that is injective and then a bijection to end we have r s r r r s which implies that r s r r r s when r s has fip a converse of theorem 4 8 is developed in the following corollary corollary 6 2 let r s be an fcp extension the following state ments are equivalent 1 r s is an almost pru fer extension 2 there exists an order isomorphism r s r r r s defined by t t r rt if these conditions hold then msupp r r msupp s r and msupp r r msupp s r moreover if r s is an fip extension these conditions are equiv alent to 3 r s r r r s proof 1 2 by proposition 4 3 and theorem 4 8 2 1 since is a bijection there exists u r s such that u r s u r ru then r s is almost pru fer by proposition 4 3 if these conditions hold then msupp r r msupp s r and msupp r r msupp s r by theorem 4 8 assume now that r s has fip 2 3 obviously 3 2 assume that r s r r r s holds the map which holds in theorem 6 1 is the same as the map defined in 2 being injective it defines a bijection over r r r s giving 2 we recall the fundamental role of the support in an fcp extension proposition 6 3 14 proposition 4 1 let r s be a ring extension if there exists a maximal chain r r 0 ri rn s of extensions where ri ri 1 is minimal with crucial ideal mi for example if r s is an fcp extension then supp s r is a finite set in fact supp s r mi r i 0 n 1 moreover for each p supp s r we have vr p supp s r splitting ring extensions 33 let r s be an fcp extension in 26 theorem 4 6 we set r rr r which is the greatest almost pru fer subextension of r s the almost pru fer closure of r s in particular r resp r is also the integral closure resp pru fer hull of r in r we get the following theorem theorem 6 4 let r s be an fcp extension then r r m m msupp r r r 1 r r proof we consider the almost pru fer extension r r according to proposition 4 3 r r splits at r with r r o the complement of r in r r set x msupp r r and y xc the complement of x in msupp r r so that y msupp r r and r y xc by theorem 4 8 then proposition 5 7 gives that r y r m r m y c r m r m msupp r r because x y c c in particular r r m m msupp r r r assume that r r so that there exists u 1 r r such that r u 1 is a minimal necessarily integral extension by maximality of r indeed if r u 1 is minimal pru fer then r u 1 is pru fer a contradiction it follows that there exists r 1 r u 1 such that r r 1 is a minimal integral extension let x r 1 be such that r 1 r x and set m c r r 1 msupp r 1 r msupp r r since x r it follows that there exists s r m such that xs r giving x 1 rm so that r 1 m rm a contradiction then r r set i r r since r r has fcp 13 theorem 4 2 implies that r i is an artinian ring so that v i m 1 mn is a finite set by the previous equality we get that r mi v i r mi since v i msupp r r 14 proposition 4 1 let y r for each i nn we have y r mi and there exists i r mi such that iy r but in r i we have spec r i m 1 i mn i d 1 d n where i is the class of i in r i hence r i n i 1 r i i and there exist 1 n r such that x 1 n i 1 i i i giving that y n i 1 y i i xy but y i r for each i implies that 1 x y n i 1 y i i r with 1 x 1 i so that y r 1 i conversely if y r 1 i there exists some x i such that 1 x y r with x mi for each i whence 1 x 6 mi for each i then for each i we get that y r mi and y m msupp r r r m r to conclude we have r r 1 i 34 g picavet and m picavet corollary 6 5 let r s be an fcp extension and t r r then r r 1 r t proof use theorem 6 4 with s r t then r is also the pru fer hull of r s and t is the integral closure of r s corollary 6 6 if r s is an fcp extension such that r r 0 then r r so that r is pru fer closed in s proof obvious since r r 1 r corollary 6 7 an fcp extension r s with conductor i r r is almost pru fer if and only if r 1 i s is integral in which case r s r 1 i is pru fer proof the first part follows from theorem 6 4 set 1 i and assume that the extension is almost pru fer let x s r there exist a positive integer n 1 and a 0 an 1 r such that x n n 1 i 0 aix i 0 for each i 0 n 1 there exists si such that bi aisi r set s n 1 i 0 si sis i where s i for each i 0 n 1 multiplying the two sides of by sn we get sx n n 1 i 0 s n 1 is ibi sx i 0 so that sx r to sum up we have proved that for any x s there exists some s such that sx r which means that s r since an almost pru fer extension is quasi pru fer r s r is pru fer the following lemma gives a new result on r lemma 6 8 let r s be an fcp extension such that r 6 s then r 6 r if and only if msuppr r r 6 msuppr s r in which case r r t r s r t almost pru fer proof obviously msuppr s r msuppr r r msuppr s r set t r assume first that t 6 r since r is also the integral closure of r in t with r t almost pru fer we have msupp r r msupp t r moreover there exists r r t such that r r is a minimal pru fer extension set n c r r max r and m n r then m msupp t r in view of proposition 6 3 the assumption gives that m 6 msupp r r so that msupp r r 6 msupp s r conversely assume that msupp r r 6 msupp s r and let m msupp s r msupp r r so that m msupp s r let c be a maximal chain defined by r r 0 ri rn s where ri ri 1 is minimal with mi c ri ri 1 there exists splitting ring extensions 35 some k such that mk r m set n mk r spec r then m n r with n max r because r r is integral and n msuppr s r according to 27 lemma 1 8 there exists t 1 r s such that r t 1 is pru fer minimal with n c r t 1 so that n msuppr t 1 r leading to m msupp t 1 r so that msupp t 1 r msupp r r because m 6 msupp r r it follows that r t 1 is almost pru fer and t 1 r t to conclude r 6 r the last assertion comes from msuppr t r msuppr t r for any t r t the above lemma allows us to calculate the cardinality of r s for an fip extension r s corollary 6 9 let r s be an fip extension with msuppr r r 6 msuppr s r set r r ri i 1 n and r s r j j 1 p then r s p j 1 rj n i 1 si where rj ri r r ri r j almost pru fer for each j and si r j r s ri r j almost pru fer for each i more precisely si r ti where ti is the almost pru fer closure of ri s proof in theorem 6 1 we define the bijection r s t t r r r s t t almost pru fer by t t r rt so that r s r s but r s p j 1 ri r j r r r s ri r j almost pru fer n i 1 ri r j r r r s ri r j almost pru fer this gives the first result fix some ri r r ri 6 r the assumption gives r 6 s then r is also the integral closure of ri in s we may apply lemma 6 8 to the extension ri s because msuppri r ri msuppri s ri if msuppri r ri msuppri s ri then n msuppri r ri for any n msuppri s ri let ri t 0 tl r tm s be a maximal chain of extensions such that tk tk 1 is a minimal extension for each k 0 m 1 set mk c tk tk 1 this means that for each k l there exists k l such that mk ri mk ri so that mk r mk r msuppr r r since msuppr r r 6 msuppr s r there exists some k l such that mk r 6 msuppr r r in particular mk ri 6 msuppri r ri for any i k while mk ri msuppri s ri a contradiction it follows that msuppri r ri 6 msuppri s ri 36 g picavet and m picavet let ti be the almost pru fer closure of ri s by lemma 6 8 we have r ti r j r s ri r j almost pru fer so that si r ti we may remark that when ri r we get si r s since msuppr r r let r s be an fcp extension since r r is almost pru fer we may apply the previous results to the extension r r keeping in mind that r resp r is also the integral closure resp pru fer hull of r r proposition 6 10 let r s be a fcp extension the following statements hold 1 the maps r r r r r r defined by t t r tr and r r r r r r defined by t t r t r for any t r r are order isomorphisms 2 msupp r r msupp r r msupp r r msupp r r and msupp r r msupp r r msupp r r 3 the maps 1 r r r r defined by 1 t tr and 1 r r r r defined by 1 t tr are order isomorphisms 4 the map r r r r r r defined by t t tt is an order isomorphism in particular if r s has fip then r r r r r r proof 1 and 2 follow from proposition 4 3 theorem 4 8 and corol lary 6 2 3 we begin to remark that r and r play symmetric roles then use proposition 4 14 1 4 is proposition 4 14 2 the fip case is obvious corollary 6 11 let r s be an fcp ring extension the following properties hold 1 ur v r implies u v for any u v r r 2 u r v r implies u v for any u v r r 3 ur v r implies u v for any u v r r 4 u r v r implies u v for any u v r r proof apply corollary 4 9 to the extension r r since r r splits at r and r corollary 6 12 let r s be an fcp ring extension and let t u r s be such that r t is integral and r u is pru fer splitting ring extensions 37 1 v t wt implies v w for any v w r u 2 v u w u implies v w for any v w r t proof use corollary 6 11 applied to the extension r tu because t resp u is the integral closure resp pru fer hull of the almost pru fer extension r tu gathering the previous results we get new equivalences for an fcp extension to be almost pru fer theorem 6 13 let r s be an fcp extension the following con ditions are equivalent 1 r s is almost pru fer 2 msupp s r msupp r r 3 the map 1 r r r s defined by 1 t tr is an order isomorphism 4 the map 1 r r r s defined by 1 t tr is an order isomorphism 5 the map r r r r r s defined by t t tt is an order isomorphism if one of these conditions holds then msupp s r msupp r r if the extension has fip the preceding conditions are equivalent to each of the following conditions 6 r s r r r r 7 r r r s 8 r r r s proof first r s is an almost pru fer if and only if s r by defini tion of r 1 2 3 4 and 5 use proposition 6 10 2 to get 2 proposition 6 10 3 to get 3 and 4 and proposition 6 10 4 to get 5 moreover proposition 6 10 2 give msupp s r msupp r r 2 1 since msupp r r msupp r r by 26 propo sition 4 18 2 leads to msupp s r msupp r r so that r s splits at r then use proposition 4 3 3 4 or 5 1 because in each case we have s rr r assume now that r s has fip then obviously 5 6 3 7 and 4 8 6 1 assume that r s r r r r by proposi tion 6 10 4 it follows that r s r r so that s r 7 1 and 8 1 by proposition 6 10 3 because in each case we get s r 38 g picavet and m picavet example 6 14 we give an example where the equivalences of the orem 6 13 do not hold because r s has not fcp set r zp and s q x x 2 where p max z then r q because r r is pru fer minimal and r s is integral minimal so that r s is almost pru fer set m pr max r with r m a local ring it follows that m msupp r r msupp s r similarly m msupp r r msupp r r indeed r r has not fcp by using the results of the paper we build the almost pru fer closure r of an fip extension r s in the context of algebraic orders in this example we determine the pru fer hull and the integral closure of the extension these three rings are distinct and distinct from r and s example 6 15 let k be an algebraic number field t be its ring of algebraic integers and r be an algebraic order of k such that r t is a minimal inert extension set m r t max r so that m max t let n max r m 6 n set r m n which is a multiplicatively closed subset then r r is a semilocal ring with two maximal ideals m m and n n moreover t t is also a semilocal ring with two maximal ideals and such that r t is a minimal inert extension withm m r t max t it verifies m msupp t r the other maximal ideal of t is p nt thanks to 13 lemma 2 4 moreover t is a pru fer domain with quotient field k according to 10 corollary 2 5 it follows that there exists a maximal chain t t 1 k of length 2 and t k has fcp and fip by 13 theorem 6 3 in fact t k 2 and any maximal chain of t k has length 2 by 13 corollary 6 13 as tm t k it follows that t tm is minimal pru fer with p c t tm since ptm tm in fact n msuppr tm t therefore t is the integral closure of r tm and 13 theorem 3 13 gives that r tm is an fcp extension for the same reason t is the integral closure r of r k and r k is an fcp extension more precisely r k is an fip extension because r t and t k have fip 13 theorem 3 13 we have the following commutative diagram rm r tm k t tp because msupp t r msupp tm t m n we get that r tm is almost pru fer by proposition 4 3 applying theorem 6 13 to the almost pru fer extension r tm we deduce that r tm splitting ring extensions 39 is minimal integral but rm tm is integral because so is r t with m r t because r rm tm is minimal we get that r rm so that rm is the pru fer hull of r tm in the same way theorem 6 13 shows that r rm is pru fer minimal but rm is also the pru fer hull of r k since there does not exist some w rm k such that rm w is pru fer otherwise w would be a zero dimensional integral domain with quotient field k a contradiction then r k is not almost pru fer since rm k is not integral and tm r is the almost pru fer closure of r k we may apply corollary 6 9 to the extension r k we al ready knows that r k has fip moreover r r r t and r k t tm tp k so that setting r 1 r and r 2 t we get r k s 1 s 2 with t 1 tm the almost pru fer closure of r k and t 2 k the almost pru fer closure of t k it follows that s 1 t tm 2 and s 2 t k 4 by proposition 3 9 since suppt k t m p max t so that r k 6 and r k r rm t tm tn k we may remark that rn tn tp more over r k is a b extension since supp k r m n max r but r is not a pm ring we end by some length computations in the fcp context proposition 6 16 let r s be an fcp extension the following statements hold 1 r r r r and r r r r 2 r r r r r r r r r r 3 r r suppr r r r r suppr r r proof to prove 1 use the maps 1 and 1 of proposition 6 10 3 then 2 follows from 14 theorem 4 11 and 3 from 13 proposition 6 12 7 pinched extensions versus split extensions we recall that a ring extension r s is called pinched at t r s if r s r t t s proposition 7 1 let r s be an fcp ring extension then any splitter is trivial in the following cases 1 r s is pinched at some u r s 2 r s is chained proof 1 assume that there exists a proper splitter t of r s by theorem 4 8 t has a complement t o in r s such that t t o 40 g picavet and m picavet r and tt o s if t t o r u then s tt o u s a contradiction if t t o u s then r u t t o r a contradiction now if t and t o are not both in either r u or u s one of then is contained in u while the other contains u so that t o is comparable to t a contradiction with t is a proper splitter by 2 a chained extension is pinched at any of its subextension then apply 1 if r s is not minimal if r s is minimal the result is obvious corollary 7 2 an fcp ring extension r s is not pinched at any proper splitter proof see proposition 7 1 we have seen in proposition 4 3 that when an fcp extension r s is almost pru fer and r 6 r s then r is a non trivial splitter this implies by proposition 7 2 that r s is not pinched at r we end this paper by a new characterization of fcp extension r s pinched at r improving our earlier result 30 proposition 2 7 because it avoids to consider minimal extensions of the form u r by only using the properties of the canonical decomposition definition 2 3 we begin by recaling 30 proposition 2 7 and then give needed lemmata proposition 7 3 an fcp extension r s such that r 6 r s is pinched at r if and only if for any u r s such that u r is minimal then msuppr s r vr u r lemma 7 4 let r s be an m crucial integral fcp extension with conductor i and n vs i there is some u r s such that u s is minimal decomposed with n vs u s if and only if there exists n vs i n 6 n such that s n s n as r m algebras proof first since r s is m crucial u s r m so that n lies above m assume that there is some u r s such that u s is minimal decomposed with n vs u s then p u s max u according to theorem 2 2 there exists n max s n 6 n such that s n s n as u p algebras since m p it follows that s n s n as r m algebras conversely if there exists n vs i n 6 n such that s n s n as r m algebras 15 lemma 20 shows that that there is some u r s such that u s is minimal decomposed with u s n n so that n vs u s lemma 7 5 let r s be an m crucial integral fcp extension with conductor i and n vs i there is some u r s such that splitting ring extensions 41 u s is minimal ramified with vs u s n if and only if n msupps n ms proof since mi ni i we may assume that i 0 then according to 13 theorem 4 2 r is an artinian ring as s and r s is an m crucial fcp integral extension to prove the statement of the lemma it is enough to show that there exists some u r s such that u s is minimal ramified with vs u s n if and only if n msupps n ms we use the proof of 15 lemma 17 we begin to show that n 6 msupps n ms if and only if the n primary component of ms in s is n this is equivalent to show that n msupps n ms if and only if the n primary component of ms in s is different from n since s is an artinian ring let ms i qi q be the primary decomposition of ms into primary ideals of s with q its n primary component so that n is the only maximal ideal of s containing q localizing at n it follows that ms n qn then q n ms n nn n ms n 0 n 6 msupps n ms assume first that there exists some u r s such that u s is minimal ramified then u s max u and is contained in a unique maximal ideal n of s set p u s which is an n primary ideal of s and satisfies m p n because r s is m crucial it follows that ms p because p is also an ideal of s assume that ms i pi n is the primary decomposition of ms in s where pi is ni primary for each i hence i pi n p a contradiction with the uniqueness of the primary decomposition it is enough to localize at n then the n primary component ofms is different from n conversely assume that then primary component ofms is different from n letms i qi q be the primary decomposition ofms in s where qi is ni primary for any i and q is n primary with q n then there exists an n primary ideal p of s such that q p n where p and n are adjacent ideals we use again the proof of 15 lemma 17 then s p has a field of representatives k s n which contains r m let s s p be the canonical surjection and set t 1 k it follows that t s is a minimal ramified extension with t s p an n primary ideal of s this completes the proof proposition 7 6 an fcp extension r s such that r 6 r s is pinched at r if and only if r s is an m crucial extension for some m max r msuppr s r vr r r and one of the following conditions holds 42 g picavet and m picavet 1 msuppr s r 2 r r is infra integral and mr n 1 n 2 where msuppr s r n 1 n 2 2 t r r r and r s are n crucial extensions where n msuppr s r msuppt r r r t r r r n 6 r n for any distinct n n vr r r except for at most one pair n n n 6 n and for any n vr r r such that n 6 n then n 6 msuppr n mr 3 r s is an n crucial extension where msuppr s r n vr r r 2 with n vr r r setting vr r r n n r r is infra integral and n 6 msuppr n mr 4 r s is crucial and r r is subintegral proof we use proposition 7 3 which says that r s is pinched at r if and only if for any u r s such that u r is minimal then msuppr s r vr u r in the two parts of the proof we discuss according to the type of the minimal extension u r assume first that r s is pinched at r and let u r s be such that u r is minimal then msuppr s r vr u r for any n msuppr s r we have u r n since r r u r n then msuppr s r vr r r holds now u r being minimal there are at most two maximal ideals in r containing u r so that msuppr s r 2 with msuppr s r 2 only if u r is minimal decomposed case i this generalizes a result by ben nasr and zeidi 4 corollary 2 10 and remark 2 11 gotten in the context of fcp extensions of integral domains in case i let n 1 n 2 max r be such that u r n 1 n 2 max u and msuppr s r n 1 n 2 this implies that m u r r ni r msuppr r r if other types of minimal extension u r exist we also have m u r r msuppr r r if there does not exist some u r r such that u r is minimal decomposed then msuppr s r 1 case ii set n msuppr s r in this case and m n r assume that there exists some u r s such that u r is mini mal with n vr u r letn msuppr s r so that n ni for some i 1 2 in case i and n n in case ii there exists some t r s such that r t is minimal with crucial ideal n by 27 lemma 1 8 then n u u r n if u r is minimal either inert or ramified and then an i extension it follows that n n and vr u r n msuppr s r so that splitting ring extensions 43 vr u r msuppr s r if u r is minimal decomposed and msuppr s r 2 then u r n 1 n 2 as we have just seen before so that n ni for some i 1 2 then we still have vr u r msuppr s r to conclude u r r m for any u r r such that u r is minimal we claim that in any case msuppr s r 1 with msuppr s r m where m max r is such that either m ni r i 1 2 in case i or m n r in case ii it is enough to show that r r is an m crucial extension because msuppr s r vr r r msuppr r r the last equality holds because r r is the annihi lator of the r module r r 5 proposition 17 page 133 and r r is integral assume that there exists m msuppr r r m 6 m since r r is an fcp integral extension it is a b extension let t rm rm be such that t rm is a minimal extension in particular t rm rm m m there is a unique t r r such that tm t and tm rm for any m max r m 6 m then t r is minimal with t r r m a contradiction with v r r m for any v r r such that v r is minimal as we have just proved above then msuppr r r m so that msuppr s r 1 and r r is an m crucial extension in order to find the other conditions we make a discussion according to the cardinality of msuppr s r and the canonical decomposition of r s case i msuppr s r 2 this case happens if there exists some u r r where u r is minimal decomposed with u r n 1 n 2 for some n 1 n 2 max r such that msuppr s r n 1 n 2 since msuppr s r 2 there cannot be some v r s such that v r is either ramified or inert otherwise v r is contained in only one maximal ideal of r a contradiction with msuppr s r vr v r in particular r r is infra integral since t r r r we claim that u is the unique v r r such that v r n 1 n 2 if there exists v r r v 6 u such that v r n 1 n 2 then 16 proposition 5 7 shows that n 1 n 2 max u v but n 1 n 2 max u with u v n 1 n 2 u n 1 n 2 since u v u is infra integral a contradiction in particular vr r r n 1 n 2 since r r r is an i extension it follows that mr is a radical ideal of r thanks to 15 lemma 17 as mr u r n 1 n 2 we get mr n 1 n 2 and 1 is proved 44 g picavet and m picavet case ii msuppr s r 1 set msuppr s r n so that r s is n crucial then any u r s such that u r is minimal satisfies n vr u r if u r is minimal either inert or ramified then vr u r n if u r is minimal decomposed we have necessarily u r n n with n vr u r and u r n u n u with vr u r n n and n 6 msuppr s r in particular m n r since msuppr s r msuppr s r assume first that t r r r which is a t closed extension and then an i extension definition 2 3 we have n t r r msuppt r r r t r r because u r n for any u r r such that u r is minimal inert by assume that there exists some p msuppt r r r t r r with p 6 n t r r there is a unique q max r lying over p with q 6 n and successive applications of ce give some u r r such that u r is minimal inert with u r q a contradiction by then msuppt r r r t r r n since t r r r is t closed and then an i extension with t r r r a radical ideal of r if there exists some v r r such that v r is minimal de composed we have v r n n with n vr v r and v r n v n v by there is at most one n vr r r n 6 n such that n vr v r for some v r s otherwise if there exists another n 6 n corresponding to some w r s such that w r is minimal decomposed with w r n n there also exists some v r s such that v r is minimal decomposed with v r n n because r n r n r n a contradiction by lemma 7 4 then there are no distinct n n 6 n such that r n 6 r n in the same way there cannot be some u r s such that u r is minimal ramified with u r contained in some n 6 n by according to lemma 7 5 this is equivalent ton 6 msuppr n mr for any n vr r r with n 6 n in this case 2 holds assume now that t r r r so that r r is infra integral set t r r assume also that t 6 r set c t r which is an intersection of finitely many maximal ideals of r by proposition 2 4 and more precisely c ni 1 ni for some integer n 2 with for instance n 1 n since r r is an m crucial extension splitting ring extensions 45 since r t is an i extension and r r is m crucial c max t as the only maximal ideal of t lying over m then there is an order isomorphism t r tc rc given by u 7 uc which leads to r c rc cc tc cc n t c n by proposition 5 22 where n t r 1 then vr c n if n 3 by lemma 7 4 there exists v r r such that v r is minimal decomposed with v r ni nj such that i j 1 i 6 j a contradiction by then n 2 and t r is minimal decomposed in particular t r n n n t n t is the only maximal ideal of t lying over m since r t is an i extension it follows that vr r r n n assume that there exists some w r r such that w r is minimal ramified then the only possible case is when vr w r n by as n w 6 n w w r it follows that there does not exist any w r r such that w r is minimal ramified with w r n which is equivalent to n 6 msuppr n mr by lemma 7 5 in this case 3 holds at last if r r r then r r is subintegral and 4 holds conversely assume that msuppr s r 1 msuppr s r vr r r and one of conditions 1 2 3 or 4 holds where msuppr s r m let u r s be such that u r is minimal then u r r m because u r r msuppr s r and r r m we are going to show that msuppr s r vr u r in each case according to proposition 7 3 1 msuppr s r 2 r r is infra integral with msuppr s r n 1 n 2 and mr n 1 n 2 it follows that n 1 and n 2 are the only maximal ideals of r lying over m since r r is infra integral u r cannot be inert if u r is minimal decomposed it implies that u r n 1 n 2 since mr u r and mr n 1 n 2 which is a radical ideal of r then there cannot be any u r s such that u r is minimal ramified according to 15 lemma 17 it follows that msuppr s r vr u r 2 msuppr s r msuppt r r r t r r n r n 6 r n for any distinct n n vr r r except for at most one pair n n n 6 n and for any n vr r r such that n 6 n then n 6 msuppr n mr 46 g picavet and m picavet since msuppt r r r t r r n and t r r r is a t closed extension n t r r r is both a maximal ideal of t r r and of r by proposition 2 5 moreover msuppr s r m and msuppt r r r t r r n implies that m n r if u r is minimal inert then u r n if u r is minimal decomposed then u r n n by and there is only at most one n 6 n such that r n r n moreover there are no distinct n n 6 n such that r n r n then u r n at last if u r is minimal ramified as n 6 msuppr n mr lemma 7 5 shows that n is the only maximal ideal ofr containing u r in any case we have msuppr s r vr u r 3 msuppr s r 1 vr r r 2 with msuppr s r vr r r setting msuppr s r n and vr r r n n r r is infra integral and n 6 msuppr n mr first u r cannot be minimal inert since r r r is minimal decomposed because vr r r 2 r r is the only u r r such that u r is minimal decomposed we have necessarily m n r because msuppr s r msuppr s r then vr r r n n implies that r r r n n so that r r r n if u r is minimal ramified as n 6 msuppr n mr lemma 7 5 shows that n is the only maximal ideal of r containing u r in any case we have msuppr s r vr u r 4 msuppr s r 1 and r r is subintegral first u r cannot be minimal either inert or decomposed as in 3 we have necessarily m n r where msuppr s r n be cause msuppr s r msuppr s r since r r is an i extension n is the only maximal ideal of r lying abovem then vr u r n and msuppr s r vr u r to sum up in any case msuppr s r vr u r which shows that r s is pinched at r we deduce from ayache s result 2 theorem 26 and proposition 7 6 the following corollary corollary 7 7 2 theorem 26 let r m be a local integral domain with quotient field k such that r k has fcp the following condi tions are equivalent 1 r k is pinched at r 2 r r is almost unbranched splitting ring extensions 47 3 either r r is infra integral r r r is minimal decomposed and r r is pinched at r r or r r is an i extension proof 1 2 by 2 theorem 26 r k is pinched at r if and only if t is local for any t r r which is equivalent to r r is almost unbranched 1 3 since r r m we have msuppr k r vr r r max r now using proposition 7 6 r k is pinched at r if and only if msuppr k r 1 msuppr k r vr r r conditions that always hold and one of conditions 1 4 of proposition 7 6 holds so that 1 is equivalent to one of conditions 1 4 of proposition 7 6 then it is enough to get conditions equivalent to conditions 1 4 under the assumptions of the corollary condition 1 msuppr k r 2 r r is infra integral and mr n 1 n 2 where msuppr k r n 1 n 2 these conditions are equivalent to r r is infra integral r r r is minimal decom posed and r r is pinched at r r since there is no minimal ramified extension u r if one of conditions 2 4 holds r r is always an i extension since msuppr k r 1 implies that r is a local ring conversely assume that r r is an i extension it follows that r is a local ring so that msuppr k r 1 set msuppr k r n then r k is n crucial if t r r 6 r then msuppt r r r t r r 1 with msuppt r r r t r r n so that vr r r 1 we get that condition 2 of propo sition 7 6 is obviously satisfied r n 6 r n since there are not distinct n n vr r r and also any n vr r r such that n n 6 n if t r r r condition 3 of proposition 7 6 cannot happen because r is a local ring contradicting vr r r 2 but condition 4 of proposition 7 6 holds because msuppr k r 1 and r r is subintegral to sum up r k is pinched at r if and only if either r r is infra integral r r r is minimal decomposed and r r is pinched at r r or r r is an i extension in 12 dobbs and jarboui introduced the notion of av ring pairs if r s is a ring extension r s is an almost valuation ring pair or av ring pair if for any t r s and any a b t there exists an integer n 1 such that either ant bnt or bnt ant they proved that when r s is an av ring pair such that r r has fcp 48 g picavet and m picavet then r s is pinched at r 12 theorem 5 6 this leads us to the following example built from 12 example 3 3 a by dobbs jarboui example 7 8 let f be a field with characteristic a prime integer p let s f x be the ring of formal power series in the indeterminate x and k its quotient field set r f xp according to 12 example 3 3 a r k is an av ring pair and s is a valuation domain so that s r assume that p 3 and let n be an integer such that 2 n p set t r xns it follows that t k is an av ring pair such that c t s xns and s is also the integral closure t of t in k since t c r r c f then t c is a field and s is a finitely generated t module with basis 1 xn 1 therefore t s is an fcp integral extension then 12 theorem 5 6 shows that t k is pinched at s we recover in this example case 4 of proposition 7 6 since t s is subintegral remark 7 9 we can note that an av ring pair is quasi pru fer let r s be an av ring pair we may assume that r 6 r s because if r r s the result is obvious then r s is integrally closed and also an av ring pair it follows from 12 proposition 2 2 that r s is a normal pair or equivalently a pru fer extension so that r s is quasi pru fer moreover r is unbranched in s since r is local thanks to 12 theorem 2 6 if in addition we assume that r s has fcp with r 6 r s we claim that r s is not almost pru fer otherwise r s splits at r 6 r then applying again 12 theorem 2 6 to the pru fer extension then a normal pair r r we get that r is a local ring in contradiction with theorem 6 13 since msupp s r msupp r r and msupp s r msupp r r msupp r r msupp r r max r in the context of fip extensions the concepts of split extensions and pinched extensions are mutually exclusive as it is explained in the next remark lemma 7 10 let r s be an fip extension and t r s then r s is pinched at t if and only if r s r t t s 1 proof since r t t s r s with r t t s t we always have r s r t t s 1 then r s r t t s 1 if and only if there exists some u r s r t t s so that r s r t t s 1 if and only if there does not exist any u r s r t t s if and only if r s is pinched at t splitting ring extensions 49 proposition 7 11 let r s be an fip extension then the follow ing statements hold 1 r r r s 1 r s r r r s 2 r r r s 1 r s if and only if r s is pinched at r 3 r s r r r s if and only if r s splits at r proof 1 the first inequality comes from r r r s r s with r r r r s the second inequality comes from theorem 6 1 2 is lemma 7 10 applied to t r if r 6 r s otherwise if r r s the result is obvious see remark 7 12 2 3 comes from corollary 6 2 and proposition 4 3 remark 7 12 1 the three statements of proposition 7 11 show that when r s is an fip extension the least value of r s is gotten when r s is pinched at r and its greatest value is gotten when r s is split at r this means that the fact that r s is either pinched at r or split at r leads to extreme situation 2 we have seen in proposition 7 1 that a splitter of r s is trivial when r s is pinched at some u r s in particular if r s has fip the only case where r s is both pinched and split at r is when r r r s 1 r r r s an easy calculation shows that this equation is equivalent to either r r or r s which recovers proposition 7 1 3 we have seen in remark 4 15 that there exists an fip extension r s and t r s such that r s r t t s although r s is not split at t 4 as for the length for an arbitrary fcp extension r s we always have r s r r r s by 14 theorem 4 11 references 1 a ayache a constructive study about the set of intermediate rings comm algebra 41 2013 4637 4661 2 a ayache when is a fixed ring comparable to all
