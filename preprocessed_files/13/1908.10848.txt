koszul homology of quotients by edge ideals rachel n diethorn abstract we show that the koszul homology algebra of a quotient by the edge ideal of a forest is generated by the lowest linear strand this provides a large class of koszul algebras whose koszul homology algebras satisfy this property we obtain this result by constructing the minimal graded free resolution of a quotient by such an edge ideal via the so called iterated mapping cone construction and using the explicit bases of koszul homology given by herzog and maleki using these methods we also recover a result of roth and van tuyl on the graded betti numbers of quotients of edge ideals of trees 1 introduction let k be a field and let r i 0 ri be a standard graded k algebra let k r be the koszul complex on a minimal set of generators of r 1 it is well known that the differential graded algebra structure on k r induces a k algebra structure on its homology h r see for example 2 1 3 this algebra structure on koszul homology holds important information about the ring r for example r is a complete intersection if and only if h r is generated by h 1 r as a k algebra 1 thm 2 7 r is gorenstein if and only if h r satisfies poincare duality 5 and r is golod if and only if k r admits a trivial massey operation 2 thm 5 2 2 another property of r that has strong connections to the structure of h r is the koszul property r is said to be koszul if k has a linear resolution over r to discuss the connections between r and h r when r is koszul one views the koszul homology algebra h r i j hi r j as a bigraded algebra where i is the homological degree and j is the internal degree given by the grading on r if r is koszul then it is known that hi r j 0 for all j 2 i 3 thm 3 1 that hi r 2 i h 1 r 2 i 4 thm 5 1 and that hi r 2 i 1 h 1 r 2 i 2 h 2 r 3 6 thm 3 1 these results show that certain parts of h r are generated by the lowest linear strand when r is koszul avramov asked the following question regarding this behavior question 1 1 if r is koszul is the koszul homology algebra of r generated as a k algebra by the lowest linear strand that is is h r generated by ihi r i 1 the answer to this question is negative in general the authors of 6 show that the koszul homology algebra of the quotient by the edge ideal of an n cycle where n 1 mod 3 is not generated by the lowest linear strand however interest lies in determining for which koszul algebras this question has a positive answer the answer is positive for the koszul homology algebra of the quotient by the edge ideal of an n path 6 thm 3 15 and for the koszul homology algebra of the second veronese algebra 10 cor 2 4 still the question remains open for many classes of algebras known to be koszul in this paper we give a positive answer to this question for a large class of edge ideals let q k x 1 xn be a standard graded polynomial ring over any field k and let i be an edge ideal associated to a tree we show that the koszul homology algebra of the quotient r q i is generated by the lowest linear strand this result extends easily to edge ideals of forests and our result recovers 6 thm 3 15 to obtain this result we utilize the so called iterated mapping cone construction and the explicit k bases of each hi r given by herzog and maleki in 14 thm 1 3 1 ar x iv 1 90 8 10 84 8 v 2 m at h a c 1 3 s ep 2 01 9 we now outline the contents of this paper in section 2 we recall some important terminology which we use throughout the paper and we discuss the main tools we use in our results including the iterated mapping cone construction multiplicative structures on resolutions and explicit bases for the koszul homology modules from 14 in section 3 we construct the minimal graded free resolution of q i over q which we use in the proof of our main result we also recover a result of roth and van tuyl in 17 on the betti numbers of such quotients q i in section 4 we state and prove the main result 2 preliminaries in this section we set up the basic terminology which we use throughout the paper and discuss the main tools we use to obtain our results let q k x 1 xn be a standard graded polynomial ring over a field k we begin by recalling the notion of graded betti numbers we consider the minimal graded free resolution f j q j i j j q j i 1 j j q j 0 j of a q module m the i th graded betti number of internal degree j is i j the betti table of m is given by 0 1 2 3 0 0 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 1 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 2 0 2 1 3 2 4 3 5 3 0 3 1 4 2 5 3 6 now we recall the following basic isomorphism which we use throughout this paper let i be a homogeneous ideal in q and let r q i throughout this paper we denote the homology of the koszul complex k x 1 xn r by h r if f is the minimal graded free resolution of r over q then there is an isomorphism of k algebras f k h r 1 thus given a basis ei 1 e i bi of fi we have that the elements e i j 1 for j 1 bi form a basis for hi r furthermore if deg e i j k then e i j 1 hi r k given this isomorphism we can represent the koszul homology algebra of r as a table 0 1 2 3 0 h 0 0 h 1 1 h 2 2 h 3 3 1 h 0 1 h 1 2 h 2 3 h 3 4 2 h 0 2 h 1 3 h 2 4 h 3 5 3 h 0 3 h 1 4 h 2 5 h 3 6 where hi j hi r j in this paper we often discuss the lowest linear strand of h r which is the second row i e row 1 in the table above 2 2 1 edge ideals let q k x 1 xn be a standard graded polynomial ring over a field k we begin this subsection by recalling the notion of an edge ideal definition 2 1 let g be a simple graph that is with no loops nor multiple edges on vertices x 1 xn the edge ideal associated to g is the ideal ig xixj xixj is an edge in g if g is a graph on the variables of q and g is a subgraph of g we write ig for the edge ideal associated to g in q the class of edge ideals we focus on in this paper is that of trees definition 2 2 let g be a simple graph g is a tree if g is connected and contains no cycle equivalently g is a tree if every vertex in g is connected by exactly one path a leaf is a vertex in g of degree 1 a forest is a disjoint union of trees and a subforest of a forest g is a subgraph of g which is a forest we illustrate the above definitions with the following example example 2 3 let q k x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 be a polynomial ring the edge ideal associated to the tree g shown in figure 1 is ig x 1 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 4 x 2 x 5 x 3 x 6 x 4 x 7 figure 1 the graph g is a tree we make the following easy remarks about trees that will be useful throughout this paper remark 2 4 i by definition a tree g must have a leaf otherwise g would contain a cycle ii it is easy to see that any subgraph of a tree is a subforest in the following subsection we discuss a way to obtain the minimal graded free resolution of a quotient by the edge ideal of a tree 2 2 iterated mapping cones in this subsection we discuss one of the main tools we use to obtain the results in this paper namely the iterated mapping cone construction we begin by recalling the notion of a mapping cone definition 2 5 let f f and g g be two complexes of finitely generated q modules and let f g be a map of complexes the mapping cone of denoted cone is the complex cone with cone i gi fi 1 i gi i 1 0 fi 1 3 it is easy to see the following fact remark 2 6 if f g then there is a short exact sequence 0 g cone f 1 0 thus g is a subcomplex of cone mapping cones can be used to build free resolutions of quotients by monomial ideals in the following way see for example 16 constr 27 3 for more details construction 2 7 let q be a graded polynomial ring and let i be the ideal minimally generated by monomials m 1 mr denote by di the degree of the monomial mi and by ii the ideal generated by m 1 mi for each i 1 we have the following graded short exact sequence 0 q ii mi 1 di 1 mi 1 q ii q ii 1 0 note that we have shifted the first term by the degree of the monomial mi 1 to make the mul tiplication by mi 1 a degree zero map thus given graded q free resolutions g i of q ii and f i of q ii mi 1 there is a map of complexes i f i gi induced by multiplication by mi 1 which we will call the comparison map the mapping cone of the comparison map is a graded free resolution f i 1 cone i of q ii 1 applying this construction for each i 1 r 1 to obtain a graded free resolution of q i q ir is called the iterated mapping cone construction we make the following important remarks about the iterated mapping cone construction remark 2 8 using the notation from construction 2 7 we note the following i the resolution of i m 1 mr produced by the mapping cone construction depends on the given order of the monomials we illustrate this remark in example 2 12 below ii for any i 1 cone i need not be minimal even if the given free resolutions f i and gi are minimal thus the resolution of i produced by the iterated mapping cone construction need not be minimal we illustrate this remark in example 2 10 below we now recall the following theorem that follows from results of ha and van tuyl in 12 and was proved independently by bouchat in 7 thm 3 0 16 it will be useful in the proofs of our results theorem 2 9 let q k x 1 xn and let g be a simple graph on vertices x 1 xn such that xn is a vertex of degree 1 and is connected by an edge to the vertex xn 1 then the mapping cone construction applied to the map q ig xn xn 1 xn 2 xn 1 xn q ig xn is a minimal graded free resolution of q ig the following example shows that the conclusion of theorem 2 9 need not hold if the graph g has no vertex of degree 1 example 2 10 let g be the 5 cycle shown in figure 2 and consider its associated edge ideal ig x 1 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 4 x 4 x 5 x 1 x 5 applying the iterated mapping cone construction to resolve q ig we get the following comparison map in the last iteration 4 0 0 q 4 q 3 2 q 2 0 q 5 q 3 3 q 4 q 2 4 q 0 0 0 1 x 4 x 2 x 2 x 4 x 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 x 1 x 1 x 5 x 4 x 5 x 1 x 5 x 1 x 2 x 3 x 3 0 0 x 4 x 5 x 1 x 4 0 0 0 x 2 x 5 0 0 0 x 3 x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 4 x 4 x 5 we see that the cone of this comparison map will produce a non minimal resolution figure 2 the graph g is a 5 cycle by remark 2 4 theorem 2 9 provides an inductive method for finding the minimal graded free resolution of q ig where g is any tree we state this as a corollary corollary 2 11 if g is a tree then in some order the iterated mapping cone construction gives the minimal graded free resolution of q ig over q the following example illustrates the importance of the order in which the iterated mapping cone construction is applied example 2 12 let g be the tree shown in figure 3 and consider its associated edge ideal ig x 1 x 3 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 4 x 4 x 5 applying the iterated mapping cone construction to resolve q ig we get the following comparison map in the last iteration 0 0 0 q 3 q 2 0 q 4 q 3 3 q 2 3 q x 3 0 0 x 5 x 4 x 5 x 4 x 2 x 1 x 2 x 4 0 x 1 0 x 4 0 x 1 x 2 x 1 x 3 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 4 however if we instead order the minimal generators of the edge ideal as ig x 1 x 3 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 3 x 4 and apply the iterated mapping cone construction we get the following comparison map in the last iteration 5 0 q 5 q 4 3 q 3 3 q 2 0 q 5 q 3 q 4 2 q 2 3 q x 5 x 2 x 1 1 x 2 x 5 0 x 1 0 x 5 0 x 1 x 2 x 4 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 x 1 x 2 x 5 x 4 0 0 0 x 4 0 0 0 x 3 x 3 x 4 x 4 x 5 x 2 x 1 x 2 x 4 x 5 0 x 1 0 x 4 x 5 0 x 1 x 3 x 2 x 3 x 1 x 3 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 it is clear that applying the mapping cone construction in these two orders produce different resolu tions we note that the second resolution is not minimal if it was it would have to be isomorphic to the first one figure 3 the graph g is a tree we use the iterated mapping cone construction in section 3 to explicitly build the minimal graded free resolution of q ig where g is a tree this resolution is an important ingredient in our proof of the main result in section 4 2 3 multiplicative structures on resolutions let q k x 1 xn be a standard graded polynomial ring over any field k and let i be a monomial ideal of q let f be the minimal graded free resolution of q i over q in this section we recall the notion of a multiplicative structure on f see for example 15 definition 2 13 a q linear map f q f f sending a b to a b is a multiplication if it satisfies the following conditions for a b f i it extends the usual multiplication on f 0 q ii it satisfies the leibniz rule ab a b 1 a a b iii it is homogeneous with respect to the homological grading a b a b iv it is graded commutative a b 1 a b b a notice we do not require that a multiplication is associative the following fact is due to buchs baum and eisenbud proposition 2 14 9 prop 1 1 the resolution f admits a multiplication this fact will be useful in the proofs of our results 6 2 4 explicit bases for koszul homology let q k x 1 xn be a standard graded polynomial ring over any field k let i be a homoge neous ideal of q and let r q i in this section we discuss explicit bases of the koszul homology modules hi r given by herzog and maleki in 14 in order to describe these bases explicitly we first set up some notation herzog and maleki define operators on q as follows for f x 1 xn and for r 1 n let dr f f 0 0 xr xn f 0 0 xr 1 xn xr it is clear that the operators dr q q are k linear maps and that they depend on the order of the variables in this paper we apply these operators to monomials the following basic lemma describes how dr behaves in this context lemma 2 15 let f be the monomial xk 1 xki with k 1 ki then dr f xk 2 xki r k 1 0 otherwise proof if r k 1 then by definition d r f xk 1 xki 0 xk 1 xk 2 xki if r k 1 then d r f f f xr 0 if r k 1 then d r f 0 0 xr 0 this simple fact will be useful in the proof of our main result the following theorem due to herzog and maleki describes explicit bases for the koszul homology modules to set notation for the theorem let f be a minimal graded free resolution of q i over q and let bi be the rank of fi for each i for each i fix a homogeneous basis ei 1 e i bi of fi and let e i j bi 1 k 1 f i k je i 1 k let dx 1 dxn be the standard generators of k x 1 xn q theorem 2 16 14 thm 1 3 for each i 1 n a k basis of hi r is given by z i j for j 1 bi where zi j 1 k 1 ki n b 1 j 1 1 bi 1 ji 1 1 dki f iji 1 j d k 2 f 2 j 1 j 2 d k 1 f 11 j 1 dxk 1 dxki in the proof of theorem 2 16 herzog and maleki show that the isomorphism 1 is given explicitly by f q k h r eij 1 z i j we conclude this section with the following remark remark 2 17 we note that in 13 herzog gives a different description of bases for hi r under the assumption that k is a field of characteristic zero in 11 the author gives explicit bases in a more general case namely the case of the koszul complex on any full regular sequence which recover herzog s bases in characteristic zero in this paper we use the description of the bases given by herzog and maleki as they hold in any characteristic and also many terms vanish in the case of a monomial ideal this vanishing plays an important role in the proof of our main result 7 3 construction of the resolution let g be a tree and let q be a standard graded polynomial ring over any field k with variables given by the vertices in g in this section we construct the minimal graded free resolution of q ig over q we begin by setting the notation to be used throughout the section we name the vertices in g as follows since g is a tree it has at least one vertex of degree 1 call it x 1 and call the vertex it is connected to by an edge x 2 call the other vertices to which x 2 is connected to by an edge x 2 1 x 2 r for each 1 r call the other vertices to which x 2 is connected to by an edge x 2 1 x 2 m note that gr x 1 x 2 x 2 1 x 2 r is a subforest in particular it is the disjoint union of m r 1 m trees call them t 1 tm with this notation in mind we view g as the following diagram figure 4 the graph g with m rm 1 we aim to resolve q ig minimally by theorem 2 9 this can be done by applying the iterated mapping cone construction as long as at each iteration we add a vertex of degree one we choose the following order to apply the iterated mapping cone construction ig x 2 x 2 1 x 2 x 2 r x 2 x 2 p 1 r p 1 m e t 1 e tm x 1 x 2 2 where abusing notation we write e ti to mean the set of relations coming from the edges of the tree ti taking the edge connecting ti to the corresponding x 2 p to be the first one by corollary 2 11 there is an ordering for each ti which will preserve minimality in the iterated mapping cone construction we choose such an ordering for each one in this way we obtain the minimal graded free resolution of q ig throughout the remainder of this section we will write this resolution more explicitly in order to obtain our main result in the next section denote by g 1 the graph gr x 1 and by c the colon ideal ig 1 x 1 x 2 it is easy to see that c x 2 1 x 2 r e t 1 e tm x 2 1 x 2 r m i 1 iti for the remainder of this paper we denote by fg 1 and fc the minimal graded q free resolutions of q ig 1 and q c respectively the following fact is a key ingredient in our results lemma 3 1 the minimal graded free resolution of q c over q is fc k x 2 1 x 2 r q q f 1 q q fm where f i is the minimal graded free resolution of q iti for each i 8 proof let a denote the subring k x 2 1 x 2 r of q and let b denote the polynomial subring on all other variables in q so that q a k b let k be the minimal graded free resolution of a j over a where j x 2 1 x 2 r and let f be the minimal graded free resolution of b l over b where l m i 1 iti then we have that k k k b and f a k f are minimal graded free resolutions of q j and q l respectively over q we note that k is precisely the koszul complex k x 2 1 x 2 r q now we have that k q f k k b q a k f k k b a k b a k f k a a k b a k b a k b b f k a a k b b f k k f thus taking homology we see that hn k q f hn k k f i j n hi k k hj f where the last equality follows from the ku nneth formula over k see for example 18 cor 10 84 thus k q f is exact in all positive degrees and h 0 k q f a j k b l q i j q c minimality is clear so we have that k x 2 1 x 2 r q q f is the minimal graded free resolution of q c noticing that t 1 tm involve disjoint sets of variables we can apply a similar argument repeatedly to conclude that f f 1 q q fm thus giving the desired result now we have that the minimal graded free resolution f of q ig over q is the cone of where is a comparison map given by fc 2 q c 2 fg 1 q ig 1 x 1 x 2 3 thus we have that f has modules fi fg 1 i f c i 1 2 and differentials i g 1 i i 1 0 ci 1 4 we make the following remark about the resolutions f 1 fm in lemma 3 1 remark 3 2 the resolutions f 1 fm are subcomplexes of fg 1 indeed a minimal resolution of q ig 1 can be obtained from each f q by the iterated mapping cone construction thus by remark 2 6 each f q is a subcomplex of fg 1 we now aim to give an explicit description of the map to obtain such a description we first observe that it is enough to define on elements of the form 1 1 lemma 3 3 if is a comparison map 9 k x 2 1 x 2 r q 2 q x 2 1 x 2 r 2 fg 1 q ig 1 x 1 x 2 then 1 m 1 m 1 m defines a comparison map in 3 before giving a proof we note that each i is a basis element of f g 1 by remark 3 2 we also note that the multiplication appearing in the definition of in the lemma is a multiplication on the resolution fg 1 it has one by proposition 2 14 thus this definition of makes sense proof we must check that is a chain map thus we compute c 1 m k 1 m m i 1 1 i 1 f i i m k 1 m 1 m m i 1 1 i 1 f i i m 1 m on the other hand we have that g 1 1 m g 1 1 m 1 m g 1 1 m 1 m 1 g 1 1 m 1 m applying the leibniz rule repeatedly and by our assumption that is a chain map we see that c 1 m g 1 1 m which completes the proof now we work towards defining a comparison map to accomplish this we need to examine fg 1 more closely we apply the iterated mapping cone construction in the order given in 2 we observe that the resolution ofq x 2 x 2 1 x 2 x 2 r produced by the iterated mapping cone procedure is precisely the taylor resolution see for example 16 constr 26 5 which we write as follows let e be the exterior algebra over k on basis elements e 1 er then the minimal graded free resolution of q x 2 x 2 1 x 2 x 2 r over q is f where fi q ei and the differentials are given by f ej 1 eji i 1 1 1 lcm x 2 x 2 j 1 x 2 x 2 ji lcm x 2 x 2 j 1 x 2 x 2 j x 2 x 2 ji ej 1 e j eji i 1 1 1 x 2 j ej 1 e j eji i 2 x 2 x 2 j 1 i 1 recall that by remark 2 6 f is a subcomplex of fg 1 we are now ready to define to set up notation we write the koszul complex k x 2 1 x 2 r q as q a 1 ar k aj x 2 j we note that if fg 1 is a dg algebra the result below follows from standard dg algebra results see 2 prop 2 1 9 otherwise a different proof is needed 10 proposition 3 4 define fc 2 fg 1 by aj 1 aji 1 m x 1 ej 1 eji 1 m 1 m then is a comparison map for fc 2 q c 2 fg 1 q ig 1 x 1 x 2 proof we define aj 1 aji x 1 ej 1 eji so that aj 1 aji 1 m aj 1 aji 1 m 1 m then by lemma 3 3 it suffices to check that g 1 k for i 2 we compute c aj 1 aji 1 1 i 1 1 1 x 2 j aj 1 a j aji 1 1 i 1 1 1 x 1 x 2 j ej 1 e j eji g 1 x 1 ej 1 eji g 1 aj 1 aji 1 1 and for any j we have k aj x 2 j x 1 x 2 x 2 j g 1 x 1 ej g 1 aj which completes the proof to summarize the discussions in this section we decompose fc 2 and fg 1 as fci 2 ki x 2 1 x 2 r q 2 f ci fg 1 i fi f g 1 i and think of the minimal graded free resolution f of q ig as the cone of the diagram q r 2 f cr q 4 r 2 f c 2 q 3 r f c 1 q 2 q r 1 f g 1 r q 3 r 2 f g 12 q 2 r f g 11 q x 1 0 x 1 0 x 1 0 x 1 x 2 5 the following corollary is an immediate consequence of the construction and diagram above 11 corollary 3 5 for k x 2 1 x 2 r q and 1 the elements 1 1 are generators of h r of internal degree 1 thus they lie on the lowest linear strand we conclude this section by noting that the constructions above provide a way of counting the betti numbers on the linear strand of f and equivalently the generators on the lowest linear strand of h r in particular we recover the following result of roth and van tuyl 17 cor 2 6 corollary 3 6 let g be a tree then 1 2 q ig e g and i i 1 q ig v g deg v i for all i 2 proof we use induction on the number of edges in g for the base case we consider the tree with one edge in this case ig x 1 x 2 and the minimal graded free resolution f of r is 0 q 2 x 1 x 2 q 0 thus we see that 1 2 q ig 1 e g now take g to be any tree and assume that the result is true for every tree with strictly fewer edges we obtain the minimal graded free resolution f of q ig as the cone of the diagram 5 constructed in this section we count the betti numbers on the linear strand as follows from 5 and corollary 3 5 we see that for i 2 we have i i 1 q ig i i 1 q ig 1 r i 1 v g 1 degg 1 v i r i 1 where the equality follows from induction separating the summand corresponding to x 2 from the rest of the sum we get that i i 1 q ig x 2 6 v g 1 deg v i r i r i 1 x 2 6 v g 1 deg v i r 1 i where the equality is just the identity called pascal s rule we note that r 1 is precisely the degree of x 2 in g thus we have the inequality i i 1 q ig v g deg v i to show equality it suffices to take e to be any basis element of f ci 1 and show that it cannot be on the linear strand by lemma 3 1 we have that e 1 m for some basis elements of k x 2 1 x 2 r and p of f p ip where i 1 im i 1 and at least one p 6 1 in the following computations we denote by the homological degree and by intdeg the internal degree in f we denote by intdegc the internal degree in fc we have that intdeg e intdegc e 2 intdegc 1 1 intdegc 1 1 1 intdegc 1 1 m 2 intdeg 1 1 intdeg 1 intdeg m where the first equality follows from the fact that f cone fc 2 fg 1 and the last equality follows from this same fact and also from remark 3 2 now by minimality we have that intdeg e 1 1 1 m m 1 12 i 1 im m 2 i m 1 i 1 therefore since e i e cannot possibly be on the linear strand and we have equality the desired formula for 1 2 q ig clearly holds 4 the main result in this section we show that question 1 1 has a positive answer for edge ideals of trees and thus also for forests throughout this section we let g be a tree and let q be a standard graded polynomial ring over any field k with variables given by the vertices in g denote by n the set indices for the vertices so that q k xn n n let g 1 be the isomorphism fg 1 q k h q ig 1 as in 1 lemma 4 1 the canonical map of k algebras h q ig 1 h r induced by the surjection q ig 1 q ig r satisfies the equality g 1 e 1 e 1 for any e fg 1 proof first recall that the quotient map q ig q i r induces the map of dg algebras k q ig k r that sends dxi to dxi for all i and the induced map h q ig 1 h r on homology is a map of k algebras since fg 1 is a subcomplex of f see remark 2 6 it is clear that the equality g 1 e 1 e 1 holds now we show that the koszul homology algebra of the quotient by ig is generated by the lowest linear strand theorem 4 2 if r q ig then h r is generated by ihi r i 1 as a k algebra proof we use induction on the number of edges in g for the base case we consider the tree with one edge in this case ig x 1 x 2 and the minimal graded free resolution f of r is 0 q 2 x 1 x 2 q 0 thus applying the isomorphism from 1 to f k we see that the only basis element of h 1 r lies in h 1 r 2 hence h r is trivially generated by the lowest linear strand now take g to be any tree and assume that the result is true for every tree with strictly fewer edges let f be the minimal graded resolution of r over q constructed in section 3 and fix the basis of each hi r given in theorem 2 16 it is enough to show that each basis element of hi r 13 is in the subalgebra generated by j hj r j 1 thus we take h to be any basis element of hi r then h e 1 for some basis element e of fi we have that f is the cone of the map fc fg 1 defined in proposition 3 4 thus fi fg 1 i f c i 1 and e must either be a basis element of f g 1 i or of fci 1 we first consider the case where e is a basis element of fg 1 i by lemma 4 1 h g 1 e 1 but by the induction hypothesis h q ig 1 is generated by the lowest linear strand so we have that g 1 e 1 c m g 1 e m m 1 1 m where is a finite set of tuples m and for 1 bm m 1 the elements e m m 1 are basis elements of fg 1 m of internal degree m 1 and where c k now we have that h c m g 1 e m m 1 1 m c m g 1 e m m 1 1 m c m e m m 1 1 m by lemma 4 1 the elements e m m 1 1 are basis elements of hm r that are in hm r m 1 thus h is generated in the subalgebra generated by the linear strand now we assume that e is a basis element of fci 1 then by lemma 3 1 e 1 m for some basis elements of k x 2 1 x 2 r and p of f p ip where i 1 im i 1 by theorem 2 16 h g where g k 1 ki n b 1 j 1 1 bi 1 ji 1 1 dki f iji 1 ji d k 2 f 2 j 1 j 2 d k 1 f 11 j 1 dxk 1 dxki 6 and each fki j is the i j th entry in the kth differential of f when viewing the differentials as matrices with respect some fixed bases recall that the operators dk depend on the order of the variables so we fix an ordering on the variables in q as follows x 1 x 2 x 2 v t 1 v tm for all where by v tq we mean the variables given by the vertices in the tree tq listed in some fixed order now we analyze the terms in 6 more carefully in order to remove the initial sum we note that since the differentials of f are given by 4 we have that for each set j 1 ji 1 there is some m such that f iji 1 ji f m 1 jm jm 1 are entries of c fmjm 1 jm is an entry of m 1 and f m 1 jm 2 jm 1 f 11 j 1 are entries of g 1 that is for each p 1 m 1 we have that 1 jp p q ig 1 and for p m i we have p q ig 1 1 jp bp then in particular we have that fmjm 1 jm x 1 by proposition 3 4 thus by lemma 2 15 we have that dkm fmjm 1 jm 0 unless km 1 also since k 1 km ki our fixed ordering on the variables implies that m 1 so every term in the sum with km 6 1 or m 6 1 vanishes giving g 1 k 2 ki n b 1 j 1 a 1 bi 1 ji 1 ai 1 dki f iji 1 ji d k 2 f 2 j 1 j 2 d 1 f 11 j 1 dx 1 dxk 2 dxki 7 14 where ap p q ig 1 1 and with f i ji 1 ji f 2 j 1 j 2 entries of c hence monomials and f 11 j 1 an entry of 0 we note that b 1 a 1 since f c 0 q thus there is only one possible index j 1 and the sum over j 1 can be removed also 0 is given by multiplication by x 1 x 2 thus f 1 1 j 1 x 1 x 2 similarly by lemma 2 15 for each f p jp 1 jp with p 1 there is only one value of kp such that dkp f p jp 1 jp is nonzero thus we see that for each set j 1 ji 1 there exist unique kp kq j 1 ji 1 for p 2 i such that g b 2 j 2 a 2 bi 1 ji 1 ai 1 dki f iji 1 ji d k 2 f 2 j 1 j 2 d 1 x 1 x 2 dx 1 dxk 2 dxki 8 with f iji 1 ji f 2 j 1 j 2 entries of c for ease of exposition in the rest of the proof we drop the bounds on the sums in 8 and we denote by jp the sum from jp ap to jp bp for each p furthermore since c 1 m k 1 m m i 1 1 i 1 f i i m our chosen order of variables and lemma 2 15 imply that the only nonzero terms in 8 are the ones such that f iji 1 ji f i im 1 ji im ji im 1 are entries of f m f i imji im 1 ji im f i im im 1 1 ji im im 1 ji im im 1 1 are entries of f m 1 f i 1 1 j i 1 j i 1 1 f 2 j 1 j 2 are entries of f 1 f 1 j j 1 f 2 j 1 j 2 are entries of k where here we identify each f p with a matrix with respect to our fixed bases notice that 8 can be written as g j 1 ji 1 dki f iji 1 ji d k 2 f 2 j 1 j 2 j 2 j dk 1 f 1 j j 1 d 1 x 1 x 2 dx 1 dxk 1 dxk 2 dxki 9 next note that the sum over j 1 can be removed indeed f 2 j 1 j 2 is an entry of f 1 1 and since f 1 is the minimal graded free resolution of a cyclic module only one index j 1 is possible the last group of sums in 9 can be pulled out to yield g j 2 j dk 1 f 1 j j 1 d 1 x 1 x 2 dx 1 dxk 1 j 2 ji 1 dki f iji 1 ji d k 2 f 2 j 1 j 2 dxk 2 dxki we observe that the homology class of the first factor is precisely 1 repeating the procedure above with the sums in the second factor and then taking homology classes we find that h 1 1 1 m 1 by remark 3 2 since 1 m are basis elements of f g 1 a similar inductive argument to the one given in the first case implies that h 1 c m 1 m m 1 1 m c m m m m 1 1 m 15 where each q m m 1 is a basis element of fm of internal degree m 1 in addition by corollary 3 5 1 is a generator of h 1 r that is in h 1 r 2 therefore h is in the subalgebra generated by the lowest linear strand since paths are trees this recovers 6 thm 3 15 now consider a forest g by definition g is a disjoint union of trees t 1 tm thus the quotient of the edge ideal of g is of the form q ig q 1 it 1 k k qm itm where q 1 qm are polynomial rings on disjoint sets of variables such that q q 1 k k qm this induces an isomorphism on the koszul homology algebras h q ig h q 1 it 1 k k h qm itm thus yielding the following corollary as a direct consequence of theorem 4 2 corollary 4 3 if r q ig and g is a forest then h r is generated by ihi r i 1 as k algebras acknowledgments the author thanks her advisor claudia miller for guidance and support and srikanth iyengar for suggesting studying question 1 1 the author is also grateful for
