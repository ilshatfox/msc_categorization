characterization of finite e tale unramified ring extensions r s that have finitely many r subalgebras it generalizes our earlier results on diagonal ex tensions of the type r rn where r is a ring results vary along the subextensions appearing into the canonical decomposi tion of an integral extension defined by the seminormalization and the t closure of the extension a special treatment is given for a subintegral extension r s which is never unramified if r 6 s 1 a summary of the paper and some notation all rings considered are commutative nonzero and unital all mor phisms of rings are unital a ring is called local respectively semi local if it has only one maximal ideal respectively finitely many maximal ideals the conductor of a ring extension r s is denoted by r s and the set of all r subalgebras of s by r s the extension r s is said to have fip for the finitely many intermediate alge bras property if r s is finite a chain of r subalgebras of s is a set of elements of r s that are pairwise comparable with respect to inclusion we say that the extension r s has fcp for the finite chain property if each chain of r s is finite moreover an extension r s is dubbed chained if r s is a chain if m is a property of modules we say that a ring extersion r s is a m extension if m holds for the r module s for example m may be the finite free projective finite presentation properties an extension r s is said of finite type finite presentation if the r algebra s is of finite type finite presentation epimorphisms are here epimorphisms 2010 mathematics subject

03868 v 1 2 g picavet and m picavet of the category of commutative rings for example r r is a flat epimorphism for any multiplicatively closed subset of r we say that a property p of ring morphisms f r s is local if rp sq verifies p for each q spec s and p f 1 q this definition should not be confused with a ring morphism verifying locally a property that is rp sp verifies p for each p spec r if r is a ring and p spec r we denote by p the residual field rp prp of r at p for a ring extension r s q spec s and p q r there is a residual field extension p q clearly an extension r s has fip if and only if r r s s r s has fip so we can assume in many case that the conductor is 0 moreover recall that an integral extension r s has fcp if and only if r r s is an artinian ring and r s is finite 7 proposition 4 2 therefore we can often assume that r is artinian the charac terization of integral extensions that have fcp first appeared in the seminal r gilmer s paper 12 on integral domains as this condition is ubiquitous in this paper we dub these extensions r s as follows where r r s is called the nucleus of r s definition 1 1 an extension r s is called a gilmer extension if its nucleus is an artinian ring therefore an integral extension having fip is a finite gilmer extension it is easy to show that if r s is a finite gilmer extension and t r s then r t and t s are finite gilmer extensions we will show that an unramified gilmer extension is finite so that we are able to replace integrality hypotheses with finiteness assumptions we now sum up our main results using standard notation and def initions nevertheless the reader is advised that we will precise them later in this section in an earlier paper we gave a characterization of diagonal ring extensions r rn having fip n 0 an integer in volving rings with finitely many ideals see theorem 2 12 such ring extensions are e tale and finite and actually are trivial e tale covering separable finite field extensions are also e tale they are known to have fip because they are monogenic monogenic properties are beyond the scope of this paper actually we characterized arbitrary fcp and fip extensions in 7 a joint paper by d e dobbs and ourselves whose proofs do not need some monogenic conditions another point of view is given by the so called separable algebras explored in 6 we will not use the terminology of 6 because it may cause some confusion moreover in the context of the paper separable ring extensions identify to e tale algebras these observations motivated us to examine integral e tale extensions that have fip actually we will also look at integral e tale fip extensions 3 unramified extensions because on one hand the unramified property is sufficient to get some results and on the other hand the flatness condition acts on the nullity of the conductor note also that we have a surprising converse if r s is a seminormal and infra integral fi nite gilmer extension then r s is unramified and has fip see proposition 5 3 as in some of our earlier papers our strategy will consist to use the canonical decomposition of an integral ring extension at this stage some recalls about seminormality and t closedness are needed follow ing 23 and 29 an extension r s is termed 1 infra integral if r s is integral and all its residual extensions are isomorphisms 2 subintegral if r s is infra integral and spectrally bijective 3 seminormal if the relations b s b 2 b 3 r b r 4 t closed if for all b s r r b 2 rb b 3 rb 2 r b r the seminormalization sr of r in s is the greatest subalgebra b r s such that r b is subintegral and the smallest subalgebra c r s such that c s is seminormal the t closure tsr of r in s is the greatest subalgebra b r s such that r b is infra integral and the smallest subalgebra c r s such that c s is t closed for an integral extension r s the tower r sr t sr s is called the canonical decomposition of r s seminormalizations and t closures commute with the formation of localizations at arbitrary multiplicatively closed subsets 29 proposi tion 2 9 and 22 proposition 3 6 if r s is seminormal r s is a radical ideal of s it is now worth noticing that there are integral extensions having fip which are not unramified we studied in 26 idealizations having fip let r be a ring and m an r module then the idealization of m is the extension r r m defined by r 7 r 0 while the multiplication on r m is defined by r m s n rs rn sm we proved that an idealization of an r module m has fip if m has finitely many submodules such an extension is subintegral but is never unramified see remark 2 10 2 in section 2 we give recalls and technical results needed for our the ory in particular we introduce minimal extensions and their relations with the fip and fcp properties a crucial result is that a quasi finite for example unramified gilmer extension is finite we also introduce some special rings like spirs and rings with finitely many ideals for a ring extension r s with finite maximal support we define the 4 g picavet and m picavet localization r r s s r s with respect to r s where r r s is a semi local ring this localization encodes many properties of r s while its conductor is zero when r s is finite and flat for example finite e tale section 3 develops global results apart some localization results about e tale gilmer extensions see theorem 3 4 and corollary 3 5 where we prove in particular that a gilmer e tale extension is locally a trivial e tale cover our first result shows that a t closed unramified finite extension r s has fip if and only if r s is a gilmer exten sion many results ensue from the fact that some e tale covers become locally trivial after a base change it is then enough to use our earlier results on trivial e tale covers in 25 for example an e tale extension has fip when its domain is a fmir and the extension verifies some rank properties see theorem 3 10 also an unramified gilmer exten sion r s has fip when its nucleus is a reduced ring we will see that the subintegral part r sr is never unramified even if r s is unramified this fact introduces some real difficulties that we already met in 8 and 27 one main result is that if r s is an e tale ex tension whose domain has only finitely many ideals then r s has fip in case rkp sp 2 for each p supp s r such that rp is a spir naturally the converse does not hold as the following carica tured example shows whatever may be a ring r the extension r r is e tale and has fip the above result generalizes theorem 2 12 gotten for diagonal extensions in section 4 we suppose that r is a local ring in order to study the subintegral part of a finite extension r s indeed this part is never unramified even if r s is e tale finite so this section may seem to be disconnected from the subject of the paper but is here to give a description as complete as possible actually we show that a subintegral fip extension r t over a local ring can be immersed in an e tale extension necessarily of the type r rn with r non reduced if and only if t verifies some conditions see proposition 4 7 it re mains that we are not able to give a characterization of the subintegral part of a finite unramified e tale extension as a by product we get that the fip property can be reduced to local subextensions when r is henselian artinian under additional and necessary hypotheses we get that a subintegral ring extension has fip if and only if it is chained a significative consequence is as follows let r s be a finite e tale local gilmer extension which is not seminormal and whose nucleus is an infinite artinian ring then r s has fip if and only if r sr is chained see proposition 4 13 e tale fip extensions 5 section 5 is concerned with seminormal extensions we show that a finite seminormal and infra integral gilmer extension r s is un ramified and has fip this case corresponds to the part sr t sr of the canonical decomposition the behavior of tsr s is elucidated in section 3 the above considerations show that the seminormal case is much more agreeable and gives rise to results different from the previous sections we also get that r s has fip and is integral seminormal if and only if its nucleus is artinian and reduced among other results characterizing seminormal finite fip extensions 2 recalls and results needed in the sequel 2 1 unramified and e tale algebras we recall some material about e tale algebras a ring morphism r s is called unramified net in french with the raynaud s definition 28 if r s is of finite type and its s module of ka hler differentials s r 0 an r algebra s of finite type is unramified if and only if the property un holds see 28 exercices p 38 1 un psq qsq and p q is a finite and separable field extension for all q spec s and p q r we will use the following definition a ring morphism r s is called e tale if and only if it is flat of finite presentation and unram ified 28 corollaire 1 p 55 the e tale and unramified properties are universal that is stable under any base change a ring morphism r s is called an e tale cover if r s is e tale and finite an e tale cover is called trivial if it is isomorphic to a diagonal extension of the form r rn for some integer n 0 14 remarque 18 2 7 proposition 2 1 14 proposition 17 3 3 v let r s be an unram ified extension and t r s then t s is unramified we note here for later use the following result lemma 2 2 let r s be an extension such that r and s share an ideal i then s r is isomorphic to the s module s i r i gotten via s s i proof first observe that s r j j 2 where j ker s r s s is generated over s by the elements s 1 1 s with s in s it is clear that ij 0 so that j j 2 is an s i module we thus get s r s r s i s i s r s s i s i r i by 28 proposition 5 p 27 6 g picavet and m picavet 2 2 some finiteness results next result is crucial proposition 2 3 20 proposition 2 p 6 02 let r s be a flat epi morphism where r is zero dimensional then r s has the property se r s is surjective the following result is a strengthening of a well known result 14 proposition 18 3 1 it provides a connexion with the work of 6 lemma 2 4 let r s be a finite extension 1 r s is of finite presentation if r s is projective 2 r s and s r s s are projective if and only if r s is projective and unramified and if and only if r s is e tale 3 if r s is e tale and r t is an intermediary unramified extension then r t and t s are e tale projective and finite proof 1 since r s is finite it is of finite type then use 19 theorem 4 4 2 suppose that r s is e tale since r s is of finite presentation and finite by 13 chapter i proposition 6 2 10 s is an r module of finite presentation it follows that s is a projective r module because it is flat for s rs s see 14 proposition 18 3 1 for the converse use 1 to get that r s is of finite presentation then again apply 14 proposition 18 3 1 3 we first observe that t s is unramified by proposition 2 1 consequently t s is projective because r t is unramified 6 chapter ii proposition 2 3 whence faithfully flat it is also of finite presentation again by 13 chapter i proposition 6 2 10 or by 1 therefore t s is e tale by 14 17 3 4 and so is r t by 14 17 7 7 moreover r t is finite because it is integral proposition 2 5 let r s be a quasi finite gilmer extension then r s is finite in particular gilmer extensions that are either un ramified or have fcp are finite moreover an e tale gilmer extension is finite and projective proof we can assume that r s 0 and that r is an artinian ring the result is then a consequence of the zariski main theorem since a quasi finite extension r s is a finite extension r r followed by a flat epimorphism of finite presentation r s 28 corollaire 2 p 42 then r s is finite because r s is a flat epimorphism whose domain is zero dimensional whence is surjective by property se proposition 2 6 let r s be an extension and p spec r e tale fip extensions 7 1 if r s is e tale and r is reduced then s is reduced it follows that ps is a radical ideal 2 if r s is a unramified extension and r is an artinian ring then ps q 1 qn where q 1 qn are the prime ideals of s lying over p proof 1 is well known 28 proposition 1 p 74 2 assume that r s is unramified and that r is artinian then r s is finite by proposition 2 5 this entails that s is an artinian ring isomorphic to sq q spec s it follows that ps psq q r p qsq q r p by property un so that ps q 1 qn where the prime ideals qi are those above p 2 3 minimal extensions and extensions having fcp minimal extensions are examples of extensions that have fip this concept was introduced by ferrand olivier 10 recall that an extension r s is called minimal if r s r s the key connection between the above ideas is that if r s has fcp then any maximal necessarily finite chain r r 0 r 1 rn 1 rn s of r subalgebras of s with length n results from juxtaposing n minimal extensions ri ri 1 0 i n 1 since minimal extensions are of finite type monogenic it follows that an extension that has fip is of finite type we will use the following theorem theorem 2 7 24 theorem 3 3 let r t be a ring extension and m r t then r t is minimal and finite if and only if m max r and one of the following three conditions holds 1 inert case m max t and r m t m is a minimal field extension 2 decomposed case there exist m 1 m 2 max t such that m m 1 m 2 and the natural maps r m t m 1 and r m t m 2 are both isomorphisms 3 ramified case there exists m max t such that m 2 m m t m r m 2 and the natural map r m t m is an isomorphism then supp t r m holds in each of the above three cases moreover r m t m identifies to r m r m r m in case 2 and to r m r m x x 2 in case 3 next result describes minimal extensions appearing in the canonical decomposition if r u v s is a composite of extensions then u v is called a subextension of r s theorem 2 8 let r s be an integral extension that has fip with canonical decomposition r sr t sr s 8 g picavet and m picavet 1 r sr is a composite of finitely many ramified minimal ex tensions and its minimal subextensions are ramified 2 sr t sr is a composite of finitely many decomposed minimal extensions and its minimal subextensions are decomposed 3 tsr s is a composite of finitely many inert minimal extensions and its minimal subextensions are inert proof 1 since r sr is subintegral its spectral map is bijective and its residual extensions are isomorphisms these properties hold for any minimal subextension which is therefore ramified 2 since sr t sr is infra integral its residual extensions are iso morphisms this property holds for any minimal subextension which has to be either ramified or decomposed let a b be such a minimal subextension and set m a b since sr t sr is seminormal so is sr b then c sr b is a radical ideal in b moreover sr b is a finite fip extension so that r c and b c are artinian rings giving that b c is a product of finitely many fields it follows that b c is absolutely flat then c m implies that m c is a radical ideal of b c so that m is a radical ideal of b and a b is decomposed 3 is 7 lemma 5 6 proposition 2 9 suppose that r s is an integral minimal exten sion then r s is not unramified if it is ramified if r s is inert it is unramified if and only if r r s s r s is a separable field extension if r s is decomposed it is unramified proof use theorem 2 7 which describes the extension r m s m where m r s for a minimal extension r s with conductor a maximal ideal m then apply lemma 2 2 remark 2 10 1 we immediately observe that a finite minimal mor phism has fip but is not generally e tale for example consider a finite minimal morphism r s whose domain is local and is not a field by theorem 2 7 its conductor is the maximal ideal of r if such a morphism is e tale it is flat so that r is a field by 10 lemme 4 3 1 2 we now observe that a subintegral extension r s that is either finite or of finite type is never unramified deny then zorn lemma guaranties that there is some t r s such that t s is a minimal extension and this extension is unramified and finite let m max t be the conductor t s then t m s m is also unramified if t s is inert then t m s m an absurdity if t s is decomposed the spectral injectivity is violated if t s e tale fip extensions 9 is ramified then s m t m x x 2 is not unramified over t m because the polynomial x 2 is not separable as in some of our earlier papers the canonical decomposition of a finite extension r s leads to different cases the subintegral part r sr cannot be unramified by remark 2 10 2 even if r s is unramified this fact forbids us to use lemma 2 4 except when r is seminormal in s this case is studied in section 5 2 4 some special rings rings with finitely many ideals were char acterized by d d anderson and s chun recall that a spir is a special principal ideal ring i e a ring r with a unique nonzero prime ideal m rt such that m is nilpotent of index p 0 hence a spir is not a field and each nonzero element of a spir is of the form utk for some unit u and some unique integer k p we deduce from the proof of 7 lemma 5 11 that an artinian local ring r m is infinite if and only if r m is infinite theorem 2 11 1 corollary 2 4 a ring r has only finitely many ideals if and only if r is isomorphic to a finite product of finite local rings infinite spirs and fields we call fmir such a ring we observe that a fmir is an artinian ring and that its local rings can only be infinite fields finite rings and infinite spirs as we wrote in the summary our interest was motivated by the two next statements fmirs already appear when considering e tale algebras over a field theorem 2 12 25 theorem 4 2 let r be a ring and n 1 an integer then r rn has fip if and only if r is a fmir with n 2 when r has at least an infinite spir local ring theorem 2 13 5 proposition 3 a v 29 if k is a field and k a is an e tale algebra then k a has fip and a is a fmir as an example we extract from 8 proposition 4 15 the following more precise result for a positive integer n 1 recall that the nth bell number bn is the number of partitions of 1 n 3 p 214 proposition 2 14 let r be ring then the diagonal extension r rn is e tale a trivial e tale cover for any integer n 1 moreover if r is a field then r rn has bn elements and r n has 2 n ideals 2 5 some results on extensions having fip here are some no tation definitions and results needed in the sequel let r be a ring as usual spec r resp max r denotes the set of all prime ideals resp maximal ideals of r if i is an ideal of r we 10 g picavet and m picavet set vr i p spec r i p and dr i is its complement if r s is a ring extension and p spec r then sp is the localization sr p we denote the integral closure of r in s by r recall that if e is an r module its support suppr e is the set of prime ideals p of r such that ep 6 0 and msuppr e suppr e max r is also the set of maximal elements of suppr s r because a support is stable under specializations finally denotes proper inclusion and x denotes the cardinality of a set x proposition 2 15 let r s be a ring extension 1 if r s has fcp fip then supp s r 2 if msupp s r then r s has fcp fip if and only if rm sm has fcp fip for each m msupp s r 3 if r s is integral then r s has fcp if and only if r s is a finite gilmer extension 4 r s has fip if and only if r sr sr t sr and t sr s have fip proof read 7 proposition 3 7 corollary 3 2 theorem 3 13 theorem 4 2 theorem 5 9 corollary 2 16 if r s is an integral extension that has fip then r s is finite and a composite of n finite minimal extensions ri ri 1 with conductor mi moreover suppr s r is a finite set in fact vr r s suppr s r mi r i 0 n 1 max r proof read 7 corollary 3 2 4 proposition 17 p 133 we note here two useful results proposition 2 17 let r s be an extension that has fip let also j be an ideal of s and i j r then r i s j has fip proof it is enough to observe that an element of r i s j is of the form t j where t r s contains j by a noether theorem we have t j t j j t j t remark 2 18 we will also use the following result if r 1 rn are finitely many rings the ring r 1 rn localized at the prime ideal p 1 r 2 rn is isomorphic to r 1 p 1 for p 1 spec r 1 this rule works for any other prime ideal of the product 2 6 localization with respect to the conductor the above re sults suggest to introduce the following definition definition 2 19 letr s be a ring extension such that msupp s r has finitely many elements m 1 mn for example msupp s r supp s r is finite if r s is a finite gilmer extension e tale fip extensions 11 we set r r s rr m 1 mn and u r s ur m 1 mn u r r r s for any r module u the ring r r s is semi local note that 1 r s r m 1 mn in case vr r s suppr s r for example if r s is finite the above multiplicatively closed subsets have the same saturation so that r 1 r s r r s is an isomorphism in case r s is finite and msupp s r is finite we have r r s s r s r s r s and msupp s r s r r s max r r s the extensions r r s s r s and r s with the hypotheses of definition 2 19 share usual properties proposition 2 20 let r s be an extension such that msupp s r then r r s s r s verifies p if and only if r s verifies p when p is one of the following properties finite of finite type gilmer property fip flatness unramified seminormal infra integral subintegral note that r s r r s s r s proof we first observe that a maximal ideal ofr is either in supp s r or not moreover the conductor of a finite extension commutes to the formation of localizations finiteness properties hold because of lemma 2 22 for the fip property see proposition 2 15 2 for the gilmer property it is enough to observe that a ring r is artinian if and only if max r is finite and the length of rm is finite for each m max r for some other properties we may use the fol lowing fact by the very definition of a support rp sp for any p suppr s r and also rp sq for each q spec s lying over p therefore r s is flat respectively unramified if and only if so is r r s s r s for the seminormal infra integral and subintegral properties use the following statement let r s be an extension then the map ds r s dr r s induced by spec s spec r is an homeomorphism and rp sq is an isomorphism for each q ds r s and p q r remark 2 21 1 let r s be an extension such that r r s s r s is defined and p a property of ring morphisms verified by ring isomorphisms then r s verifies locally p if and only if r r s s r s verifies locally p 2 we can add in proposition 2 20 two properties p finite and projective and finite and e tale when r s is of finite presentation see theorem 3 6 this holds if r is a ring such that flat modules of finite type are projective i e is a s ring known cases of s rings are semi local rings and rings whose total quotient ring is semi local as noetherian rings and integral domains see 9 theorem 2 12 g picavet and m picavet lemma 2 22 let r s be a ring extension such that msupp s r then rm sm is finite of finite type for eachm msupp s r if and only if r s is finite of finite type proof let m s sm be the natural map for m msupp s r and assume that rm sm is finite for each m msupp s r there is a finite system gm of elements of s such that m gm generates sm over rm now gm m msupp s r clearly generates s over r as a module for the finite type property the proof is similar the following definition will also be used definition 2 23 let r s be an extension with msupp s r we set msupp s r m msupp s r rm if u is any r module we also set u r s ur m 1 mp where msupp s r m 1 mp proposition 2 24 let r s be a finite extension with msupp s r then r s has fip respectively is a gilmer extension if and only if r r s s r s has fip respectively is a gilmer extension proof if rm is finite then rm sm has fip because r s is finite then use proposition 2 15 2 for the fip property for the gilmer property observe that the length of rm is finite if rm is finite lemma 2 25 if r s is a finite and locally free i e flat extension then rp sp r s p 0 for each p supp s r if in addition r s is a gilmer extension then r r s s r s 0 r s ker r r r s and r r s r r s proof since r s is finite we can reduce to the case where r m is local and then r s is free of rank n let e 1 en be a basis of s over r suppose that n 1 then we can write 1 riei with ri r if each ri is in m then 1 belongs to some maximal ideal n of s lying over m because r s is finite this is absurd and we can suppose that r 1 is a unit of r therefore e 1 r 1 1 1 j 6 1 rjej entails that 1 e 2 en is a basis of s over r now for r r s we have re 2 u 1 for some u r so that r 0 if n 1 let e 1 be a basis then 1 re 1 for some r r shows that r is a unit in s as r s is integral and injective we see that r is invertible in r and then e 1 r it follows that r s an absurdity we observe that i r s is locally trivial and in particular is a pure ideal such that r i is flat over r it follows that i j ij for each ideal j of r and then for all x i there is some y i such that x xy therefore i is the kernel of r r 1 i r r s then e tale fip extensions 13 r i r r s is a flat epimorphism by 17 corollaire 3 2 p 114 i because maximal ideals of r i can be lifted up to r r s this last map is an isomorphism 3 e tale morphisms we begin with some results on diagonal extensions r rn n 2 an integer 3 1 properties of diagonal extensions lemma 3 1 for n 2 r rn 0 r rn is locally an isomor phism whence is infra integral moreover r rn is seminormal if and only if r is reduced proof the extension is a local isomorphism and infra integral by re mark 2 18 suppose that r is reduced if x y r are such that x 2 y 2 and x 3 y 3 then x y by 29 lemma 3 1 it follows that r rn is seminormal conversely if r s is seminormal its conductor 0 is a radical ideal and r is reduced we will show that an e tale gilmer extension is infra integral if and only if it is locally a diagonal extension see corollary 3 5 3 note that r rn cannot be subintegral since n 2 actually we have a result similar to lemma 3 1 for an extension which has fip proposition 3 2 if r s is an integral extension that has fip then r s is seminormal if and only if r s is a semiprime ideal of s proof we need only to show that r s semiprime in s implies the seminormality of r s consider the seminormalization t of r in s and suppose that r 6 t then there exists some integral minimal extension r u with u t then r u does be ramified with conductor p a maximal ideal of r such that there is some maximal ideal p of u such that p 2 p p because of theorem 2 8 clearly we have r s u r u p since r s is supposed to be semiprime in s it follows that r s u p q where q is either u or an intersection of maximal ideals of u different from p therefore the p primary ideal r u contains p q whence is equal to p a contradiction 14 g picavet and m picavet 3 2 first results we prove a first positive result in the t closed case proposition 3 3 let r s be a t closed unramified finite integral extension then r s has fip if and only if r s is a gilmer exten sion in that case each minimal subextension is inert with separable minimal residual field extensions proof assume that r r s is artinian we can suppose that r s 0 and that r m is local artinian with m supp s r spec r and then s is artinian as r s is t closed there is only one prime ideal n of s lying over m 22 the ore me 3 11 and then s n is local property un implies that ms n and that the residual extensions are separable whence have fip since r s is seminormal r s is semiprime so that r s n m since r m s n is separable this extension has fip and so does r s it follows that any decomposition of r s into minimal extensions is composed of inert extensions whose residual field extensions are separable and minimal the converse holds because the property fip implies the property fcp and then we can use proposition 2 15 3 we intend to study e tale gilmer extensions let r s be a finite extension and p spec r in the next proposition we set n p spec p r s that is the cardinal of the fiber at p of r s and by q 1 qn p the elements of this fiber theorem 3 4 let r be an artinian ring and r s an e tale exten sion the following statements hold 1 r s is a projective finite extension 2 let q spec s and p q r then rp sq is an extension and rp sp is free with finite rank moreover ps is a radical ideal of s equal to q 1 qn p 3 there is an e tale extension r n p p sp where n p s ps r p i 1 n p qi p 4 r s is infra integral if and only if n p s ps r p for each p spec r and if and only if sp is isomorphic to rp n p for each p spec r 5 r s is subintegral if and only if r s 6 rp sq is e tale finite and has fip if r s has fip proof 1 r s is projective finite by proposition 2 5 2 observe that the maps rp sp and rp sq are extensions because they are faithfully flat actually rp sp is free because flat and finite moreover ps is a radical ideal by proposition 2 6 e tale fip extensions 15 3 since sp is artinian it is isomorphic to sqi qi spec sp where q 1 qn is the finite set of maximal ideals of s lying over p there is a factorization rp rp n sp since rp rp n is e tale so is rp n sp by lemma 2 4 then we get n s ps r p because p n p r s and p r p 4 set n n p for a prime ideal p of r if n s ps r p we get by 3 that p qi for each i and rp sp is infra integral the converse is clear assume that rp sp is infra integral then rnp pr n p sp psp is an isomorphism because by 2 we have s ps n i 1 s qi r p n so that sp psp r p n p rp prp n the nakayama lemma implies that rnp sp since prp is a nilpo tent ideal 4 corollaire 1 p 105 for the converse use lemma 3 1 5 suppose that in addition to the hypotheses of 4 spec s spec r is injective it follows from 4 that each n p 1 and rp sp 6 now rp sq is e tale because rp sp is e tale and so is sp sq indeed sp sq is a flat epimorphism which is surjective by the property se and is therefore of finite presentation because sp is noetherian suppose that in addition r s has fip we have just shown that rp sq is of the form rp sp sq where sp sq is surjective denote by j the ideal of sp such that sq sp j we have j rp 0 we are in position to apply proposition 2 17 since rp sp has fip and then rp sq has fip hence if r is an artinian ring and r s is e tale and has fip then rp sq has fip this means that r s has locally fip in view of lemma 3 1 the same result is valid for the e tale extension r rn even if r is artinian and r rn has not fip see theorem 2 12 thus an extension that has locally fip does not need to have fip corollary 3 5 let r s be an e tale gilmer extension the following statements hold 1 r s is finite and projective and vr r s supp s r is a finite subset of max r 2 rp sq is e tale and finite for q spec s and p q r moreover rp sq has fip if r s has fip 3 r s is infra integral if and only if sm is rm isomorphic to some rm n for each m supp s r where necessarily n n m 4 r s if and only if r s is subintegral 16 g picavet and m picavet proof thanks to proposition 2 5 we get that r s is finite so that supp s r v r s it is projective by proposition 2 5 for the statements about infra integrality and subintegrality use proposi tion 2 20 and theorem 3 4 we thus find that an e tale finite extension is never subintegral an observation that already appeared in remark 2 10 theorem 3 6 let r s be an infra integral gilmer extension con sider the following statements 1 r s is e tale 2 r s is of finite presentation and is locally a trivial e tale cover that is for each p spec r sp rp n p for some integer n p 3 r s is locally a trivial e tale cover and r is an s ring for instance is either semi local or whose total quotient ring is semi local then 1 2 and 3 1 proof 1 2 assume that r s is e tale then locally s rn for some integer n in view of corollary 3 5 conversely since r rn is e tale for any integer n by proposition 2 14 r s is flat unramified and of finite presentation 3 1 because r s is then flat and unramified whence finite to conclude r s is projective by definition of an s ring see re mark 2 21 and is then of finite presentation by lemma 2 4 so that 2 is verified theorem 3 7 let r s be an e tale infra integral gilmer extension then r s has fip if and only if the nucleus of r s is a fmir and the cardinal of each fiber at a prime ideal m supp s r is 2 as soon as rm is an infinite spir proof we saw that under the hypotheses r s r s 0 so that r s m 0 for m supp s r set r r r s and m m r s for m supp s r we get that rm r m to conclude it is enough to apply theorem 2 12 and corollary 3 5 it is worth noticing that theorem 3 7 gives an answer for the part r tsr of the canonical decomposition of r s the next result has a simple proof because it concerns an extension whose domain is artinian reduced whence absolutely flat theorem 3 8 let r s be an unramified gilmer extension whose nucleus is reduced then r s is finite and has fip e tale fip extensions 17 proof there is no harm to assume that r is an artinian ring with maximal ideals m 1 mn where n 0 is an integer proposition 2 5 shows that r s is finite moreover supp s r is finite since so is the spectrum of r for each i rmi smi is e tale over the field rmi in view of theorem 2 13 this extension has fip since the support of s r is finite we get that r s has fip by proposition 2 15 2 remark 3 9 1 we now exhibit an e tale finite extension r rn s with conductor 0 by lemma 3 1 for any integer n 2 which has not fip showing that supposing only r with finitely many ideals is not sufficient and such that r is local artinian and is not reduced let k be an infinite field and set r k x x 2 where x is an indeterminate over k then r is a local artinian ring in fact an infinite spir with maxi mal ideal m such that m 2 0 and r m k then r rn is e tale by proposition 2 14 but has not fip by theorem 2 12 2 consider the faithfully flat e tale finite extension r r 2 s where we choose a ring r with finitely many ideals for instance a finite ring we can write s r rt for some t s in view of 11 proposition 4 12 there is a bijection from r s to the set of ideals of r it follows that r s has fip whereas r is not necessarily reduced there are no rank conditions because they are hidden by the choice of r rn with n 2 3 here is an example of an unramified infra integral fip extension which is not seminormal let r p be a spir such that p rz with z 2 0 take r k z z 2 k z where k is a field set t r x zx x 2 r x and s t y y 2 y zy x t y it is easy to see that r t is minimal ramified and t s is minimal decomposed 7 theorem 2 3 then r s has fip is infra integral and not seminormal moreover m p rx is the only prime ideal of t and q m ty q m t 1 y are the two prime ideals of s we get that ps m qq giving psq qq sq qsq and psq qq sq q sq so that r s is unramified since the residual extensions are isomorphisms 4 another example is as follows and shows that under the hypothe sis of theorem 3 4 the rank of s over rmay not be defined let r be an artinian reduced ring and f 1 fn r such that f 1 fn r we set s n i 1 rfi it is known that r s is a faithfully flat e tale morphism localizing the extension at each p spec r we get morphisms of the form rp sp rp p where p is the number of open subsets d fi containing p while rp is a field in view of proposition 2 15 2 and theorem 2 13 r s has fip 18 g picavet and m picavet 3 3 the case of a base ring with finitely many ideals we intend to generalize theorem 2 12 to e tale extensions r s that may not be infra integral as in a trivial e tale cover theorem 3 10 let r s be an e tale extension where r is a fmir 1 the ring s is a fmir and if q spec s and p q r then sq is a field respectively a finite ring an infinite spir if and only if rp is a field respectively a finite ring an infinite spir 2 if in addition rkp sp 2 for each prime ideal p suppr s r such that rp is an infinite spir then r s has fip proof we begin with the proof of 2 we can assume that the conduc tor of r s is zero and we will prove that rp sp has fip for each p supp s r if rp is either a field or a finite ring we know that rp sp has fip because r s is finite the only case to consider is when a rp is an infinite spir with maximal ideal m and then we have rkp sp 2 in this case a sp is an e tale cover because this extension is finite denote by a a strict henselization of a the ring a is local with maximal ideal m ma and a a is a faithfully flat ring morphism 28 pp 94 95 it follows that a is zero dimensional and noetherian whence artinian 28 pp 94 95 moreover if m at and m is nilpotent of index p 0 we have m a t and m is nilpo tent of index p 0 it follows that a is an infinite spir we deduce from 14 proposition 18 8 1 stating that an e tale cover over a strict henselian ring is trivial that sp a a a n for some integer n nec essarily equal to 2 therefore a sp a has fip by theorem 2 12 since a a is faithfully flat it descends morphisms that have fip 8 theorem 2 2 we have thus proved that r s has fip 1 now let q be a prime ideal of s lying over p in r since s is ar tinian we can identify this ring with a finite product of its localizations at prime ideals therefore to prove that s has finitely many ideals it is enough to prove that the rings sq have the same property now since sq is a localization of sp we need only to prove that sp has only finitely many ideals this is clear if rp is either a field or a finite ring in case a rp is an infinite spir the above argumentation without rank hypotheses shows that sp a n is faithfully flat and clearly a n has finitely many ideals to complete the proof it is enough to observe that for a faithfully flat ring morphism b c and i an ideal of b we have ic b i now by theorem 3 4 6 rp sq is faithfully flat finite and e tale if rp is a field then sq is a field since isomorphic to a product of e tale fip extensions 19 finitely many fields because r sq is e tale if rp is finite so is sq if rp is an infinite spir then sq cannot be neither a field nor finite deny then rp would be either a domain or finite if sq is either finite or a field so is rp suppose that sq is an infinite spir if rp is finite then p is finite and p q is finite so that q is finite this in turn implies that sq is finite an absurdity now if rp is an infinite field then sq is a product of fields because rp sq is e tale an absurdity it follows that rp is an infinite spir corollary 3 11 let r s be an e tale gilmer extension whose nu cleus is a fmir if rkrp sp 2 for each p suppr s r such that rp is an infinite spir then r s has fip proof we can replace r with r r s so that the base ring is a fmir because r r s s r s 0 then we can use theorem 3 10 because the spectrum of r r r s is the set of all extensions m of prime ideals m in supp s r so that rm r m is an isomorphism corollary 3 12 let r be a ring which is a product of finitely many fields and finite rings and r s s t two e tale extensions then s t has fip remark 3 13 let r be a ring with finitely many ideals and p x r x a monic polynomial we set r 1 r x p x if the de gree of p x is two then r r 1 has fip by 11 proposition 4 12 which states that there is a bijection from r s to the set of ideals of r so from now on we suppose that n 2 and that p x is a separable polynomial that is p x a x p x b x r x for some a x b x r x we have p x x a 1 p 1 x where a 1 is the class of x in r 1 and some p 1 x r 1 x then r r 1 is faithfully flat finite e tale and its conductor is 0 note that we can apply theo rem 3 9 if there is no infinite spir in the product of rings defining r because the rank of r 1 over r is constant and 2 4 the local case we intend to examine subintegral extensions when the base ring is local henselian for example artinian we recall that this kind of extension is never unramified 4 1 the fip property via local subextensions we begin with a generalization of a a result of m kosters established for a local artinian ring 16 lemma 4 12 it will allow us to reduce the study of the fip property of a finite extension r a where r m is a local henselian ring to local subextensions r b of r a where b n 20 g picavet and m picavet is a local ring we observe that r b is a local morphism we denote by r a loc the set of all subextensions of r a that are local we set ax an n x for any x max a and denote by a the set of all partitions of the finite set max a if s 1 sn is a partition of max a we set ai asi for i 1 n proposition 4 1 let r m be a local henselian ring and r a a finite ring extension so that a amax a 1 let s 1 sn be a partition of max a and let bi r ai loc with maximal ideal mi for each i 1 n then b n i 1 bi belongs to r a max b n 1 nn where ni mi j 6 ibj moreover the fiber of ni in a is si and bni bi 2 there is an injective map r a a p a x p r ax loc moreover the image of is p x p r ax loc p a proof by the very definition of an henselian ring we have that a amax a 28 chapter 1 hence we will replace a by the product 1 since we have bi an n si it is clear that b a because si n i 1 is a partition of max a then max b is well known within the ordering it follows from remark 2 18 that bni bi the maximal ideals of ai are lying overmi observe that there is a bijection si max ai we deduce from this fact that each element of si is lying over ni now if p is a maximal ideal of a which does not belong to si there is some j 6 i such that p sj and then p contracts to nj 6 ni hence the fiber of ni in a is si 2 let b r a the map max a max b defined by p 7 p b defines an equivalence relation whose classes are a partition p s 1 sn of max a set ni p b for each p si now 28 proposition 2 p 7 shows that bni is integral over r and is henselian therefore ani is the product of its local rings and finally we get that ani ap p b ni ai we deduce from 1 that bni r ai loc we then set b p bn 1 bnn where each bni r ai loc suppose that b c for b c r a set bi bni and b n i 1 bi then max b n 1 n n where n i ni j 6 ibj by 1 we have b n i bi bni but b b and n i is the only maximal ideal of b lying over ni then b n i b ni bni so that b b n i 1 bi n i 1 ci c it follows that is injective we infer from the above proposition the next result theorem 4 2 let r a a finite ring extension where r is a local ring the following statements are equivalent 1 r a has fip e tale fip extensions 21 2 r a loc is finite and r r a is henselian 3 r a loc is finite and r r a is artinian we note here a generalization of a result of m kosters given in a more general context but with less results because our context is richer proposition 4 3 m kosters let r m be an infinite local ring and r s a gilmer extension then r s has fip if and only if r m s ms has fip ms m is a uniserial r module and r r nil s has fip proof to prove this first observe that we can reduce to the case r s 0 then use some parts of the proof of 16 proposition 4 13 the step ii being superfluous because of theorem 4 2 proposition 4 3 is trivial if either r s m or r s is infra integral because in that case each t r s is contained in r nil s we will examine the condition ms m is uniserial in the following proposition 4 4 let r m be an infinite local ring and an unrami fied gilmer extension r s whose nucleus is not a field then r s has fip if and only if r r ms has fip and ms m is a uniserial r module in case s n is local then ms m n m proof we know that if r s is unramified then r m s ms is e tale and then nil s ms because s ms does be reduced more over an e tale algebra over a field has fip for the last statement use property un 4 2 the subintegral part of an e tale extension let r be ring and n 1 a positive integer we have seen in lemma 3 1 that r rn is an infra integral e tale extension which is not seminormal if r is not reduced in this case there is a subintegral part r rnr of the extension r rn we consider the inverse problem given a subintegral extension r t does there exist some infra integral e tale extension r s such that t r s assuming that r is a local artinian ring theorem 3 6 can be used we first give a general result proposition 4 5 let r t be a ring extension where r is a local artinian ring there exists an infra integral e tale extension r s such that t r s if and only if there exists some integer n such that t r rn up to an isomorphism of r algebras proof assume that there exists some integer n such that t r rn up to an isomorphism of r algebras set s rn since r 22 g picavet and m picavet rn is an infra integral e tale extension by lemma 3 1 so is r s and we have t r s conversely assume that there exists an infra integral e tale extension r s such that t r s then r s is a gilmer extension since r is artinian applying theorem 3 6 we get that s rn for some integer n giving that t r rn up to an isomorphism of r algebras the following example shows how to build an extension r s satisfying the conditions of proposition 4 5 given a particular minimal ramified and then subintegral extension r t example 4 6 let r m be a spir with m rt satisfying t 2 0 t 6 0 and let r t be a minimal ramified extension such that t r rx with tx x 2 0 it is enough to take t r x x 2 tx then p rx rt is the maximal ideal of t and m r t r x there is an injective morphism of r agebras t r 2 such that a bx a bt a indeed is well defined let z t with z a bx c dx a b c d r since d b x a c r it follows that d b m so that there exists r such that d b t then we get that a c tx 0 giving a c and b d t so that a bt c d t t c dt the same reasoning shows that is injective since a bx a bt a 0 0 implies first that a 0 and then bt 0 so that b m giving bx 0 hence t is an r subalgebra of r 2 identifying t and t so that 1 1 1 and x t 0 we get that t r 2 is a minimal decomposed extension with r 2 t y where y 1 0 satisfies y 2 y 0 p and py rxy rty rx p it follows that t r 2 r so that t r r 2 where r r 2 is an infra integral e tale extension according to proposition 4 5 we are led to the following problem given a subintegral fip extension r t what are the conditions in order that t r rn for some integer n we first observe that r must be non reduced since r rn is not seminormal lemma 3 1 in order that r rn has fip r is necessarily an fmir theorem 2 12 and proposition 4 5 forces r to be either a non reduced finite local ring or an infinite spir in which case n 2 proposition 4 7 let r t be a subintegral fip extension where r m is either a finite local ring which is not a field or a spir 1 there exists some integer n with n 2 if r is an infinite spir such that t rnr if and only if t r mr n 2 there exists some integer n with n 2 if r is an infinite spir such that t r rn if and only if t r n for some r submodule n of mrn containing m satisfying n 2 n e tale fip extensions 23 proof since r t is a subintegral fip extension it follows that t is a local artinian ring let n be its maximal ideal so that t r n because r m t n moreover r is not reduced 1 assume that t rnr then t r n is a seminormal extension with t rn n mrn in view of proposition 3 2 since n is the only prime ideal of t and mrn is the intersection of the prime maximal ideals of rn so we get that t r mrn conversely assume that t r mrn since t rn mrn is a radical ideal of rn then t rn is a seminormal extension by proposition 3 2 so that t rnr since r t is subintegral 2 assume that there exists some integer n such that t r rn then t rnr since r t is subintegral it follows that m n mrn in view of 1 with n an r module but as n is an ideal of t we have n 2 n conversely assume that t r n for some r submodule n of mrn containing m satisfying n 2 n then t rn giving t r rn moreover n 2 n implies that tn rn n 2 n hence n is an ideal of t such that n r m moreover n is a prime ideal by a noether s isomorphism for rings r m t n so that n n 4 3 subintegral extensions over local rings we now give some results about necessarily local subintegral extensions r s having fip in case they are gilmer extensions we need a result about an extension r s where r r s m r s is a local artinian ring we will set rk r m n ks giving rise to a sequence r 0 r r 1 rn 1 r ms s where n 1 is the nilpotency index of m r s it is clear that each extension rk rk 1 is a 0 extension in the sense of 15 that is each rk submodule of rk 1 containing rk is an element of rk rk 1 it follows that each element of rk 1 is a zero of a monic polynomial of rk x with degree 2 loc cit we will need some lemmata in view of 7 proposition 3 7 c there is a preserving order bijection r s r r s s r s given by t 7 t r s proposition 4 8 let r m be a local ring such that r m is infinite and let r s be a finite subintegral gilmer extension the following statements are equivalent 1 r s has fip 2 r s is chained 3 if n 1 then r rn 1 rk k 0 n 1 and rn 2 s 4 if n 1 then r s 4 24 g picavet and m picavet if one of the previous statements holds then r rn 1 n and when n 1 each rk rk 1 is a minimal ramified extension for k 0 n 2 moreover there exists s such that s rn 1 with 3 ms and one of the three following situations is satisfied either rn 1 s or rn 1 s is a minimal ramified extension or there exists t rn 1 s such that both rn 1 t and t s are minimal ramified extensions proof we know that r s has fcp by 7 theorem 4 2 then 1 2 by 8 proposition 4 13 indeed this proposition says that r s r s 1 where r s is the supremum of the lengths of any maximal chain of r subalgebras of s now 2 1 because r s is chained so that r s is composed of the elements of the unique finite maximal chain going from r to s for the equivalence 1 3 we may assume that r s 0 in view of a preceding remark we first assume that m 6 0 so that r is not a field in view of 7 proposition 5 15 1 is equivalent to r rn 1 and rn 2 s have fip but r rn 1 has fip if and only if r rn 1 rk k 0 n 1 by 7 lemma 5 12 and rn 2 s has fip if and only if rn 2 s 4 by 7 lemma 5 14 so that 1 3 assume now that m 0 so that r is a field then n 1 and 1 r s 4 3 by the proof of 2 lemma 3 6 b we come back to the general case if one of the previous statements holds then r rn 1 n and when n 1 each rk rk 1 is a minimal ramified extension for k 0 n 2 by the proof of 3 moreover 7 lemma 5 13 gives the last part of the statement first in s r s and then in s lemma 4 9 let r m be a local ring such that r m is infinite and r s a finite subintegral gilmer extension whose nucleus is not a field and has n as nilpotency index let mi m m n is then if r r ms has fip there exists some xi mi mi 1 such that mi m rxi for i 1 n 1 proof we can apply theorem 2 8 to r r ms which states that ri 1 ri is a minimal ramified extension so that the length of the ri 1 module mi mi 1 is 1 24 theorem 3 3 we deduce from 18 theorem 13 p 168 by the northcott extension formula for length that the length over r of mi mi 1 is 1 and then mi mi 1 rxi for any xi mi mi 1 set n m rxi then n mmi m rxi m 2 mn i 1 s m mn i 1 s rxi mi 1 rxi mi then the nakayama lemma shows that n mi e tale fip extensions 25 lemma 4 10 let r m be a local ring such that r m is infinite ring and r s a subintegral finite gilmer extension the following statements are equivalent 1 ms m is an uniserial r module 2 r r ms is a chained extension 3 lr ms m n 1 where n is the nilpotency index ofm r s 4 r i m i is a spir for i m ms r r ms and there exists some x ms such that ms m rx if one of the above statement holds then i r s m proof as in a previous proof we may first assume that r s 0 since r s i m ms we also may assume thatm 6 r s indeed ifm r s the conditions 1 2 3 and 4 are trivially satisfied in particular this holds when r is a field assume that ms m is an uniserial r module and let t r r ms then t n is a local artinian ring and r t is subintegral it follows that t n r m and t r n with r n m and n jm msk where jm msk denotes the set of r modules between m and ms let r r ms jm msk be the map defined by t 7 n then is an injective map which is order preserving it follows that r r ms is a chain we have 2 3 in view of 27 lemma 4 1 since r is not a field assume that r r ms is a chained extension and then fip we will denote by x a typical element of n ms m m s r first observe that i is the annihilator of the r module n mn 1 m rxn 1 the map r n defined by a 7 axn 1 is a surjective morphism of r modules then i ker is an ideal of r and n r i as an r module we denote by the induced isomorphism r ker n but by lemma 4 9 m m 2 s m rxn 2 so that m m 2 s m rxn 2 mn m r m m i we deduce that m i 1 rxn 2 r i 1 xn 2 is monogenic as an r i module whence is a principal ideal of r i since r is local artinian we get that r i is a spir and there exists some x xn 1 ms such that ms m rx by lemma 4 9 conversely assume that r i m i is a spir for i m ms r r ms and there exists some x ms such thatms m rx the preceding proof shows that we have an isomorphism of r modules r i ms m since r i is a spir its ideals are linearly ordered as they are also its r submodules the r submodules of ms m are linearly ordered assume that one of the above statement holds since ms is the maximal ideal of r sm we get that ims r so that im r 26 g picavet and m picavet s 0 giving im 0 and i 0 m but 0 m ms 0 gives 0 m i coming back to the general case where r s 6 0 we obtain i r s m example 4 11 we are going to show that the two conditions of 4 of lemma 4 10 are necessary let k be an infinite field set r k t t 3 and s k t y t 3 y 3 t 2 y 2 let t resp y be the class of t resp y in r resp s then r m is an infinite spir where m rt and r s a subintegral finite extension such that r r s is an artinian ring in fact r s 0 and m 3 0 m 2 6 0 so that the nilpotency index ofm is 3 using notations given before proposition 4 8 and in lemma 4 9 we get m 2 ms st and m 1 m m 2 s rt st 2 we see easily that 1 t t 2 is a basis of the k vector space r and 1 t t 2 y ty t 2 y y 2 ty 2 is a basis of the k vector space s this gives that m 2 is a k vector space with basis t t 2 ty t 2 y ty 2 and m 1 is a k vector space with basis t t 2 t 2 y giving dimk m 2 5 and dimk m 1 3 so that dimk m 2 m 1 2 lr m m 2 m 1 lr m 2 m 1 since mm 2 m 1 it follows that r 1 r 2 is not a minimal ramified extension 7 lemma 5 12 and r r ms is not a chained extension because it has not fip so the condition that r i m i is a spir is not sufficient to guarantee that r r ms be chained theorem 4 12 let r m be a local ring such that r m is infinite and let r s be a finite and subintegral gilmer extension the fol lowing statements are equivalent 1 r s has fip 2 r s is chained 3 if n 1 then r rn 1 rk k 0 n 1 and rn 2 s 4 if n 1 then r s 4 4 if n 1 then ms m is an uniserial r module and rn 2 s is chained proof we have already proved that 1 2 3 now 2 4 by lemma 4 10 and 7 proposition 5 15 when n 1 we note here that an integral gilmer extension r s is spectrally injective if and only if sr t sr 22 theorem 3 11 moreover if r is local and r r s is artinian then r s is spectrally injective if and only if s is a local ring indeed ds r s dr r s is a bijective map e tale fip extensions 27 proposition 4 13 let r s be a finite local e tale gilmer exten sion that is not seminormal and whose nucleus is an infinite artinian ring then r s has fip if and only if r sr is chained proof we denote by m the maximal ideal of r we know that r s is finite and gilmer then integral and fcp denote by the semi normalization of r in s then r is subintegral and also finite because of the spectral injectivity is also the t closure of r s moreover r r is artinian infinite and not a field indeed in case r m we get that m is a maximal ideal of and then r m m implies that r an absurdity now s is local and artinian it follows that the t closed and unramified finite exten sion s has fip thanks to proposition 3 3 since r s has fip if and only if r and s have fip 7 theorem 5 9 r s has fip if and only if r has fip to conclude use theorem 4 12 the lacking parts of the canonical decomposition when the base ring is local are particular cases of results of section 5 namely propo sition 5 3 and corollary 5 4 5 e tale and seminormal extensions lemma 3 1 shows that the seminormality of r rn is equivalent to the reduction of r we are thus lead to examine e tale extensions that are seminormal and what happens when r s is seminormal a case we excluded in proposition 4 13 proposition 5 1 let r s be a finite extension whose nucleus is zero dimensional then r s is seminormal if and only if s r s is absolutely flat if and only if s r s is reduced proof we can assume that r s 0 and that r is local with max imal ideal m indeed seminormality and absolute flatness commute with localization moreover s r s is reduced if and only if it is locally reduced then r m is a zero dimensional local ring and s is a zero dimensional semi local ring suppose that r s is seminormal we get that r s 0 n 1 nn m where n 1 nn is the set of all maximal ideals of s in fact r s is finite so that there are finitely many maximal ideals in s max s spec s since s is zero dimensional then s n i 1 s ni is a product of finitely many fields it follows that s is absolutely flat and reduced to show the converse assume that s is absolutely flat it is enough to observe that r is a field since a reduced local zero dimensional ring because s is a reduced zero dimensional ring then 0 r s is 28 g picavet and m picavet semiprime in s and 0 r t is semiprime in t for each t r s it follows that r s is seminormal 7 lemma 4 8 in particular this holds if s is reduced the next result generalizes proposition 5 1 proposition 5 2 let r s be an e tale ring extension such that r is artinian then s r s is reduced if and only if r s is seminormal and in this case r s has fip moreover r s m msupp s r bnm where nm rkr m s ms proof observe that r s is finite by corollary 3 5 then r s is seminormal if and only if s r s is reduced by proposition 5 1 to show that r s has fip we can assume that r is a field by using proposition 2 15 2 indeed we may assume that r s 0 and that r is local now r s has property fip by theorem 2 13 by 5 definition 1 ch 5 p 28 there is a base change r l where l is a field extension of r such that l r s l n then n is necessarily dimr s the result follows from proposition 2 14 and 8 lemma 2 1 since the base change r l is faithfully flat the last statement is a consequence of 7 theorem 3 6 we first offer two results showing that the involved morphisms do be unramified when r s is seminormal proposition 5 3 let r s be a seminormal and infra integral finite gilmer extension then r s is unramified and has fip proof we can suppose that r m is a local ring since supp s r because r s is seminormal r s is a semi prime ideal in s it follows that r s m and also r s p 1 pn where p 1 pn are the maximal ideals of s containing r s since r s is infra integral r r s s r s identifies to r m r m n since this last extension is e tale and has fip then r s is unramified by lemma 2 2 and has fip because supp s r m corollary 5 4 let r s be a seminormal finite unramified gilmer extension then r tsr and t sr s are unramified and have fip they are e tale if r s is e tale proof the statement about r tsr follows from proposition 5 3 to prove the statement for tsr s it is enough to show that this extension is a gilmer extension thanks to proposition 3 3 but the gilmer condition follows from r s tsr s and the finiteness of r tsr for the last property use lemma 2 4 e tale fip extensions 29 theorem 5 5 let r s be an e tale extension the following state ments hold 1 r s has fip is seminormal and finite if and only if its nucleus is artinian and reduced 2 r s has fip is finite and and its nucleus is reduced if and only if r s is a seminormal gilmer extension proof 1 assume that r r s is artinian and reduced in that case r r s s r s is finite and e tale in view of theorem 3 8 this extension has fip and is seminormal and finite the same properties hold for r s conversely assume that r s has fip and is seminormal and finite we know that r s is a gilmer extension because it is finite moreover the seminormality of r s entails that r s is semi prime in s 7 lemma 4 8 whence in r 2 if r s has fip and is finite then r r s is artinian which gives by 1 that r s is seminormal when moreover r r s is reduced conversely the seminormality of r s entails that r r s is reduced since r s is a radical ideal it follows by 1 that r s has fip when r r s is artinian consider the four conditions of theorem 5 5 a finite fip b gilmer c seminormal and d reduced nucleus we proved that a c b d and a d b c in fact a b a finite fip extension is gilmer and c d a seminormal extension has a reduced nucleus but ignoring these two results the examples below show that these four conditions are logically independent b 6 a and d 6 a take k k x where k is a field and x an indeterminate a 6 c b 6 c and d 6 c take r s minimal ramified c 6 b and d 6 b let r be a pid and set s rp where p is a prime element a 6 d take r r 2 where r is a spir b 6 d let k be a field take r k x x 2 and s r y and x y indeterminates c 6 a let r z 2 z and xi an infinite family of indetermi nates set s r xi x 2 i xi xixj as a consequence of the above theorem we see that a seminormal integral e tale extension has fip if and only if it has fcp use 7 the orem 4 2 moreover it follows from theorem 3 8 that a unramified 30 g picavet and m picavet extension r s whose conductor is an intersection of finitely many maximal ideals of r has fip we intend now to look at unramified extensions that have fip to begin with we consider integral minimal extensions we give three lemmata before giving another characterizations of seminormal e tale extensions having fip lemma 5 6 let r s be a finite ring morphism with finite separable residual extensions such that r is artinian reduced and s is reduced then r s is e tale proof since r is absolutely flat and noetherian we get that r s is flat and r s is of finite presentation let p be a prime ideal of r then rp is a field and then sp is artinian whence sp k 1 kn a product of fields that are finite extensions of p the hypotheses show that these field extensions are separable therefore 0 sp rp s r p for each p 28 proposition 11 p 34 it follows that s r 0 and r s is unramified whence e tale lemma 5 7 let r s be a seminormal integral extension which has fip then any minimal morphism a b which appears in a decomposition into minimal morphism of r s is either inert or decomposed whence unramified in case r s is e tale proof we observe that r s is finite because it has fip let i be the conductor of r s andm the conductor of a b by seminormality i is semi prime in s and is therefore a finite intersection of maximal ideals because r i and s i are artinian reduced observe that i m in b thenm is in b a finite intersection of maximal idealsm 1 mn because m i is an ideal of the absolutely flat ring b i it follows then that a b cannot be ramified for if not there is a maximal ideal n in b such that n 2 m n and then n m 1 mn an absurdity the conclusion follows from proposition 2 9 finally we give a characterization of seminormal e tale extensions that have fip we first rewrite a result of ferrand olivier lemma 5 8 let r s be a ring extension with conductor ni 1 mi mi max r for each i then rmi is a field for each i if and only if r s is flat proof as supp s r m 1 mn if rmi is a field for each i then r s is flat conversely if r s is flat so is rmi smi with conductor mirmi for each i to complete the proof use 10 lemme 4 3 1 e tale fip extensions 31 theorem 5 9 let r s be an extension of finite presentation the following statements are equivalent 1 r s is a seminormal e tale extension having fip 2 r s has finite separable residual field extensions and is finite msupp s r is finite r r r s is a reduced artinian ring and s s r s is reduced 3 same conditions as in 2 except that s is reduced is replaced with r s 0 if either 1 2 or 3 is verified then each minimal morphism a b with conductor c appearing in the canonical decomposition of r s is such that a a b ac is a field proof suppose that 1 holds we observe that r s is finite and supp s r is finite because it has fip write a decomposition r a b s of r s where a b is minimal ob serve that r a is unramified by lemma 5 7 because a composite of unramified ring morphism is unramified then apply inductively lemma 2 4 3 by using lemma 5 8 we get that ac is a field for c a b in particular rm is a field for m msupp s r the ring r is semi local with maximal ideals m 1 m n that are the min imal prime ideals of r since r r m i i 1 n is injective and its target is a product of fields r is reduced and is therefore ar tinian by the chinese remainder theorem in fact dim r 0 and r reduced give that r n i 1 r m i by seminormality r s is semiprime in s and then in r also r s rad r nil r 0 to complete the proof we see that r s has finite separable residual extensions because r s is e tale so 3 holds if 3 holds then 2 holds because the absolute flatness of r implies that r s is seminormal therefore its conductor is semiprime in s and zero so that s is reduced to end assume that 2 is valid we clearly get that r s is seminormal and flat since r is absolutely flat it follows that r s is seminormal and flat now r s is e tale it is enough to prove that r s is e tale the conclusion follows from lemma 5 6 and remark 2 21 2 finally r s has fip by theorem 3 8 we deduce that r s has fip then 1 holds observe that if r s is infra integral the separability hypotheses on residual extensions are verified actually we need only hypotheses of separability on residual extensions of tsr s a minimal extension 32 g picavet and m picavet a b with conductor m appearing in this last extension is inert so that a m b m is the only residual extension of a b that may not be separable since it is a minimal extension of fields it is either separable of purely inseparable moreover the separability of a residual extension p q is verified if r s q since this extension is an isomorphism also reduction hypotheses are valid when s is reduced they are also valid in case r s is e tale and r is reduced proposition 2 6 remark 5 10 let a be a ring p x a x and b a x p x with p x monic so that f a b is faithfully flat it is easy to show using 21 lemma 2 6 that f is infra integral if and only if p x splits in each p x for p spec a so that each fiber morphism p p ab is of the form p p n for some integer n it follows that f is e tale if f is infra integral note that the conductor of f is 0 therefore when f is infra integral f has fip and is seminormal if and only if a is artinian reduced the same result holds for a standard e tale algebra of the type r r x p x where p x r x is a monic polynomial whose derivative is invertible in r x p x
