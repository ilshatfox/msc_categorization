module e over a gorenstein local ring we provide sufficient conditions for e to be of linear type and for the rees algebra rpeq of e to be cohen macaulay our results are obtained by constructing a generic bourbaki i ideal of e and exploiting properties of the residual intersections of i 1 introduction let r be a noetherian ring and e a finitely generated r module with a rank the rees algebra rpeq of e is defined as the symmetric algebra speq modulo its r torsion submodule the main goal of this work is to provide sufficient conditions for rpeq to be cohen macaulay rees algebras arise in algebraic geometry as homogeneous coordinate rings of blow ups of schemes along a subscheme or as graphs of rational maps between varieties and have been studied in connection with resolution of singularities in many geometric situations one is interested in rees algebras of modules which are not ideals for instance the homogeneous coordinate ring of a sequence of successive blow ups of a scheme along two or more distinct subschemes is the rees algebra of a direct sum of two or more ideals moreover given a subvariety x of an affine space the conormal variety of x and the graph of the gauss map from x are projective spectra of the rees algebras of modules which are not ideals when e i is an r ideal the rees algebra rpiq coincides with the subalgebra rrits j 0 i j t j of the polynomial ring rrts if r is cohen macaulay and i has positive height the first step in order to study the cohen macaulay property of rpiq is to investigate the cohen macaulayness of the associated graded ring gpiq j 0 i j ij 1 rpiq irpiq in fact in this case gpiq is cohen macaulay whenever rpiq is 19 and although the converse is not true in general it holds if furthermore some numerical conditions are satisfied 21 23 33 39 38 27 in turn the cohen macaulay property of gpiq is well understood see for instance 40 31 30 29 12 13 16 22 11 28 by analogy with the case of ideals one defines the powers of an r module e as ej rrpeqsj where rrpeqsj denotes the degree j component of rpeq however since en 1 is not contained in en there is no module analogue for the associated graded ring hence the study of the cohen macaulay property of rees algebras of modules requires a completely different approach than in the case of ideals and much less is known about it see for instance 14 32 34 35 24 1 http arxiv org abs 1811 08402 v 3 2 alessandra costantini a systematic approach to the problem was provided by simis ulrich and vas concelos in 2003 34 given a finite r module e with a rank they construct a larger ring s which is a generic extension of r and an ideal i of s so that rpeq is cohen macaulay if and only if rpiq is i is called a generic bourbaki ideal of e see section 2 the problem of determining a sufficient condition for rpeq to be cohen macaulay is then ultimately reduced to that of crafting assumptions on e so that i has a cohen macaulay rees algebra and one could virtually attempt to extend any result known on the cohen macaulayness of rees algebras of ideals to the case of modules however this idea is often not easy to put in practice since very often transferring properties from e to i and backwards is only possible if rpeq yields a deformation of rpiq which is not always guaranteed the main goal of this work is to provide a sufficient condition for the cohen macaulayness of the rees algebra rpeq of a module e under the assumption that finitely many powers of e have sufficiently high depth more specifically we aim to generalize the following theorem proved independently by johnson and ulrich 22 3 1 and 3 4 and goto nakamura and nishida 11 1 1 and 6 3 for the rees algebra of ideals the assumptions that i satisfies g and the artin nagata property an k 1 indicate an overall nice behavior of the residual intersections of i we refer the reader to section 2 for detailed definitions theorem 1 1 11 22 let r be a local cohen macaulay ring of dimension d with infinite residue field let i be an r ideal with analytic spread height g and reduction number r and let k be an integer assume that g 1 1 k 1 r k and i satisfies g and an k 1 if depth i j d k j 1 for 1 j k then rpiq is cohen macaulay from a technical point of view the most challenging aspect of the problem is that it is not clear whether a module analogue for the artin nagata property would be well defined or behave well under passage to a generic bourbaki ideal moreover it is not guaranteed that similar assumptions on the depths of powers of e would transfer to the powers of a generic bourbaki ideal i of e nevertheless when r is gorenstein these technical obstructions can be overcome through a deep investigation of the linear type property of e and of the residual intersections of i we now describe the contents of this paper in section 2 we review the main properties of rees algebras of modules and of generic bourbaki ideals we also recall basic definitions and results on resid ual intersections of ideals that will be used throughout the paper in particular theorem 2 12 which follows from work of chardin eisenbud and ulrich 4 will be crucial in order to prove our main results in section 3 we discuss the linear type property of a module recall that a module e is said to be of linear type if its rees algebra rpeq can be expressed as a quotient of a polynomial ring rrt 1 tns modulo an ideal j generated by linear forms in rrt 1 tns our first main result theorem 3 3 shows that under mild assumptions e is of linear type if extirpe j rq 0 for finitely many given values of i and j this is obtained by showing that a generic bourbaki ideal i of e has good residual intersection properties as in theorem 2 12 we also show that the assumptions of theorem 3 3 are satisfied in a wide range of situations and provide a general technique to construct modules of linear type see theorem 3 6 section 4 is dedicated to the cohen macaulay property of rees algebras of mod ules our second main result theorem 4 3 shows that under mild assumptions residual intersections and modules with cohen macaulay rees algebra 3 the rees algebra of e is cohen macaulay if the depths of finitely many powers of e are sufficiently high recovering theorem 1 1 in the case when e i is an ideal the theorem is proved by showing that e is of linear type up to a certain codimension using theorem 3 3 and allows us to identify several examples of mod ules with cohen macaulay rees algebra a similar approach to the problem had previously appeared in work of lin 24 for more restrictive classes of modules our methods allow us to recover all of lin s main results with proofs that are logically independent of her work in particular lin s 24 3 4 is a special case of theorem 4 3 for modules with maximal reduction number see corollary 4 9 moreover theorem 4 10 for ideal modules is a minor variation of 24 4 3 and theorem 4 11 improves another of lin s results 24 3 1 regarding modules of lin ear type finally when pr mq is local theorem 4 3 and theorem 4 10 allow us to provide sufficient conditions for the special fiber ring fpeq rpeq br r m of a module e to be cohen macaulay recovering previous work of corso ghezzi polini and ulrich 5 these results are obtained by establishing a general technique to study the cohen macaulay property of the special fiber ring of a module and will be included in a separate article 8 see also the author s thesis 7 acknowledgements the content of this article was part of the author s ph d thesis the author is deeply grateful to her advisor bernd ulrich for his insightful comments and observations on the preliminary versions of the results here pre sented and for his valuable guidance through the background literature on residual intersections of ideals 2 preliminaries in this section we review basic properties of rees algebras of modules and generic bourbaki ideals and recall some facts about residual intersections of ideals 2 1 modules with a rank and rees algebras throughout this paper r will be a noetherian ring and e will be a finite r module with a rank recall that a finite r module e has a rank ranke e if e br quotprq pquotprqq e or equivalently if ep r e p for all p p assprq moreover we will often assume that e is orientable this means that e has a rank e 0 and the eth exterior power of e satisfies p e eq r where p q denotes the functor homrp rqq these notions are not very restrictive since every module admitting a finite free resolution has a rank and every module of finite projective dimension is orientable moreover every finite r module over an integral domain has a rank and every finite module over a ufd is orientable modules of rank 1 play a special role in our work in fact e is a torsion free module of rank 1 if and only if it is isomorphic to an r ideal i of positive grade a module e of rank e is said to satisfy condition gs if pepq dimrp e 1 for every p p specprq with 1 dimrp s 1 if the same condition holds for all s then e is said to satisfy g 8 notice that for an ideal i the gs condition can be restated as pipq dimrp for every p p v piq with dimrp s 1 moreover if r has dimension d then i is g 8 if and only if it is gd 1 now let rs rn e be any presentation of e the symmetric algebra of e is speq rrt 1 tns p 1 sq 4 alessandra costantini where 1 s are linear forms in rrt 1 tns so that rt 1 tns r 1 ss 1 if e has a rank the rees algebra rpeq of e is defined as the quotient of speq modulo its r torsion submodule in particular rpeq rrt 1 tns j for some ideal j called the defining ideal of rpeq the module e is said to be of linear type if speq is torsion free since in this case j p 1 sq is an ideal of linear forms modules of linear type will be the main focus of section 3 when e i is anr ideal rpiq coincides with the subalgebra rrits j 0 i jtj of the polynomial ring rrts by analogy with the case of ideals the powers of an r module e are then defined as ej rrpeqsj a more general definition of rees algebra which also applies to modules not having a rank was given by eisenbud huneke and ulrich in 10 in the same paper they also defined the notions of minimal reduction and analytic spread of a module e over a noetherian local ring see 10 2 1 and 2 3 a minimal reduction of e is a minimal submodule u e so that er 1 uer for some integer r 0 the least such integer r is denoted by ru peq and the reduction number of e is rpeq min tru peq u is a minimal reduction of eu finally the analytic spread peq of e is the krull dimension of the special fiber ring fpeq rpeqbrk where k is the residue field of r the following result extends the main properties of the analytic spread of an ideal to modules see 10 2 3 and 34 2 2 and 2 3 proposition 2 1 let r be a noetherian local ring with dimr d and residue field k let e be a finite r module paq if k is infinite all minimal reductions of e have the same minimal number of generators equal to peq moreover peq peq and equality holds if and only if e has no proper reductions pbq if k is infinite any submodule u generated by peq general elements in e is a minimal reduction of e with ru peq rpeq pcq suppose that d 0 and that e has a rank ranke e then e peq d e 1 dimrpeq 1 2 2 generic bourbaki ideals we now recall the definition and main properties of generic bourbaki ideals introduce by simis ulrich and vasconcelos in 34 notation 2 2 p 34 3 3 q let r be a noetherian ring e ra 1 ran a finite r module with ranke e 0 let z tzij 1 i n 1 j e 1 u be a set of indeterminates and denote r 1 rrzs e 1 e br r 1 xj n i 1 zijai p e 1 and f 1 e 1 j 1 r 1 xj if r is local with maximal ideal m let r 2 rpzq rrzsmrrzs and similarly denote e 2 e br r 2 and f 2 f 1 br 1 r 2 1 this definition is independent of the choice of in fact speq can be equivalently described through a universal property as a quotient of the tensor algebra of e modulo the commutators of elements of degree 1 see 3 section 1 6 residual intersections and modules with cohen macaulay rees algebra 5 theorem 2 3 p 34 3 1 3 2 and 3 4 q let r be a noetherian ring e a finite r module with ranke e 0 assume that e is torsion free and that ep is free for all p p specprq with depthrp 1 paq for r 1 e 1 and f 1 as in notation 2 2 f 1 is a free r 1 module of rank e 1 and e 1 f 1 is isomorphic to an r 1 ideal j with grade j 0 moreover j can be chosen to have grade at least 2 if and only if e is orientable pbq if e satisfies gs then so does j pcq if gradepjq 3 then e re 1 l for some r ideal l in this case lr 1 j theorem and definition 2 4 p 34 3 2 and 3 4 q let r be a noetherian local ring and e a finite r module with ranke e 0 with the assumptions of theorem 2 3 e 2 f 2 is isomorphic to an r 2 ideal i called a generic bourbaki ideal of e moreover if k is another ideal constructed this way using variables y then the images of i and k in s rpz y q coincide up to multiplication by a unit in quotpsq and are equal whenever i and k have grade at least 2 theorem 2 5 p 34 3 5 a and 3 8 q in the setting of notation 2 2 and with the assumptions of theorem 2 3 and theorem and definition 2 4 the following state ments are true paq rpeq is cohen macaulay if and only if rpiq is cohen macaulay pbq if graderpeq e then rpjq rpe 1 q pf 1 q pcq e is of linear type with graderpeq e if and only if i is of linear type if and only if j is of linear type thanks to theorem 2 5 questions about the linear type property of e or the cohen macaulay property of rpeq are reduced to the case of ideals notice that in order for the conditions in theorem 2 5 a and c to hold one must have that rpe 2 q pf 2 q rpiq and x 1 xe 1 form a regular sequence on rpe 2 q see 34 3 5 b this means that rpe 2 q is a deformation of rpiq in fact one has the following crucial technical result theorem 2 6 p 34 3 11 q let r be a noetherian ring e a finite r module with ranke e 0 let 0 f e i 0 be an exact sequence where f is a free r module with free basis x 1 xe 1 and i is an r ideal the following are equivalent paq rpeq pf q is r torsion free pbq rpeq pf q rpiq pcq rpeq pf q rpiq and x 1 xe 1 form a regular sequence on rpeq moreover if i is of linear type then so is e and the equivalent conditions above hold the construction described in notation 2 2 and theorem and definition 2 4 can be thought of as the pe 1 q st step of an iterative construction where at each step the ring is extended by adjoining n generic variables this will be relevant for the proof of theorem 4 11 in particular we will make use of the following result theorem 2 7 p 34 3 6 and 3 8 q let r be a noetherian ring e ra 1 ran a finite r module with ranke e 2 and let z 1 zn be indeterminates denote rr rrz 1 zns re e br rr x n i 1 ziai p re and r rp req pxq 6 alessandra costantini then paq x is regular on rp req pbq the natural epimorphism r rp re rrxq has kernel kerp q h 0 r prq pcq if graderpeq 2 then is an isomorphism the next proposition examines the connection between the analytic spread and reduction number of e and those of a generic bourbaki ideal i of e proposition 2 8 p 34 3 10 q let r be a noetherian local ring with dimr d and let e be a finite r module with ranke e if e admits a generic bourbaki ideal i then piq peq e 1 moreover rpiq rpeq if the residue field of r is infinite 2 3 residual intersections most of the results proved in this paper rely on properties of the residual intersections of generic bourbaki ideals of the modules under examination let r be a cohen macaulay ring and let i be an r ideal with htpiq g and s g an integer recall that a proper ideal k is an s residual intersection of i if there exists an ideal j i such that k j i pjq s and jp ip for every prime ideal p with dimrp s 1 k is called a geometric s residual intersection of i if in addition jp ip for every p p v piq with dimrp s residual intersections k of i always exist if i satisfies gs 37 1 5 and 1 6 a and can often be constructed using minimal reductions j of i see 28 3 1 or 22 2 7 for applications to the study of rees algebras it is often useful to consider also the following property definition 2 9 2 37 let r be a cohen macaulay local ring i an r ideal with htpiq g and s g an integer i is said to satisfy the artin nagata property ans if for all g i s and every i residual intersection k of i r k is cohen macaulay if the same property holds for every geometric i residual intersection then i is said to satisfy an s at least when r is gorenstein the artin nagata condition ans is satisfied by a large class of ideals including perfect ideals of height 2 perfect gorenstein ideals of height 3 complete intersections licci ideals and strongly cohen macaulay ideals notice also that ans is satisfied whenever s g 1 or when s g r is gorenstein and r i is cohen macaulay see 26 another sufficient condition is given by the following result due to ulrich theorem 2 10 p 37 2 9 q let r be a local gorenstein ring with dimprq d i an r ideal with htpiq g assume that i satisfies gs for some s g if depthpijq d g j 2 for 1 j s g 1 then i satisfies ans there is an interesting connection between the artin nagata condition and the linear type property of i as explained in the following result see also 37 1 8 and 1 9 the proof follows from the paper of ulrich 37 but we write it here for lack of a specific reference theorem 2 11 let r be a gorenstein local ring of dimension d let i be an r ideal with ht i g 1 and piq assume that i is g 1 and that depth i j d g j 2 for 1 j g then i is of linear type and rpiq is cohen macaulay residual intersections and modules with cohen macaulay rees algebra 7 proof without loss of generality we may assume that the residue field of r is infinite let j be a minimal reduction of i generated by general elements since i satisfies g 1 then htpj r iq 1 this is clear if j i if j i then from 37 1 6 it follows that j r i is a geometric residual intersection of i hence since i and j have the same radical htpj r iq 1 as claimed now by theorem 2 10 the assumption on the depths of powers of i imply that i satisfies an 1 hence if j r i is a proper ideal from 37 1 7 it follows that htpj r iq a contradiction so it must be that i j this means that i has no proper reductions whence piq in particular i satisfies sliding depth by 37 1 8 c hence by 13 6 1 it only remains to show that i satisfies g 8 notice that for every p p specprq one has pipq piq by 37 1 10 a it then follows that ip satisfies g pipq and an pipq 1 hence we can repeat the argument above to deduce that pipq pipq dimrp for every p p specprq that is i satisfies g 8 and the proof is complete thanks to work of chardin eisenbud and ulrich 4 the condition on the depths of powers of i in theorem 2 11 can be weakened to the requirement that certain ext modules vanish to produce ideals of linear type that do not necessarily satisfy the artin nagata property of theorem 2 10 see 4 5 2 more precisely one has the following result theorem 2 12 let r be a local gorenstein ring d dimr i an r ideal with htpiq g 1 and piq assume that i is g 1 and that ext g j 1 r pij rq 0 for 1 j min t g d g 1 u then i is of linear type proof without loss of generality we may assume that the residue field of r is infinite let j be a minimal reduction of i generated by general elements since i satisfies gl 1 as in the proof of theorem 2 11 it follows that htpj iq 1 now if j r i is a proper ideal one must have d 1 hence the assumption that ext g j 1 r pij rq 0 for 1 j d g 1 implies that htpj r iq by 4 4 1 and 3 4 this is a contradiction so it must be that i j whence piq therefore by 4 4 1 and 3 6 b it follows that i is generated by a d sequence hence it is of linear type see 17 theorem 3 1 an ideal i for which the vanishing conditions on the ext modules in theorem 2 12 are satisfied is called p 1 q residually s 2 since for g i 1 every i residual intersection k of i is such that r k satisfies serre s condition s 2 see 4 4 1 we refer the interested reader to the paper of chardin eisenbud and ulrich 4 for a thorough treatment of s residually s 2 ideals 2 4 ideal modules let r be a noetherian ring recall that an r module e is called an ideal module if e 0 is finitely generated and torsion free and moreover e is free where denotes the functor homrp rq equivalently e is an ideal module if and only if e embeds into a finite free module g with gradepg eq 2 see 34 5 1 in particular if e is an ideal module than e has a rank and ranke rankg an ideal module e of rank 1 is isomorphic to an r ideal i with gradepiq 2 since one can choose g r in general an ideal module e of rank e 2 behaves similarly to ideals of positive grade for instance if fittepeq denotes the e th fitting ideal of e the non free locus of e coincides with v pfittepeqq 8 alessandra costantini supppg eq moreover the analytic spread of e satisfies peq c e 1 where c htpfittepeqq see 34 5 2 this is a generalization of the well known fact that for an ideal of positive grade piq htpiq c examples of ideal modules of rank at least two include every finite direct sum of two or more ideals of grade at least two as well as the jacobian module of any normal complete intersection ring r kry 1 yms j over a perfect field k the following result shows that generic bourbaki ideals of an ideal module have nice residual intersection properties and will be used in the proof of theorem 4 10 theorem 2 13 p 34 5 3 q let r be a cohen macaulay local ring every ideal module e admits a generic bourbaki ideal i of height at least two moreover if e is free locally in codimension s 1 then i satisfies gs and ans 1 3 modules of linear type throughout this section we will assume the following setting 3 1 let r be a noetherian local ring with dimr d let e be a finite r module with rankpeq e 0 and analytic spread peq for a fixed generating set a 1 an of e let e 1 e 2 x 1 xe 1 f 1 and f 2 be constructed as in notation 2 2 assume that e 1 f 1 is isomorphic to an r 1 ideal j as an r 1 module let i jr 2 be a generic bourbaki ideal of e and let g ht i in the situation of setting 3 1 our first goal is to provide a sufficient condition for a module e to be of linear type that recovers theorem 2 12 in the case of ideals in other words we wish to be able to deduce the linear type property of e from the vanishing of finitely many modules of the form extirpe j rq for given values of i and j thanks to theorem 2 5 c it suffices to prove that a generic bourbaki ideal i of such a module e satisfies the assumptions of theorem 2 12 from the definition of generic bourbaki ideals one has the exact sequences 0 f 1 e 1 j 0 and 0 f 2 e 2 i 0 for every j 1 these induce r epimorphisms pe 1 qj jj and pe 2 qj ij which are obtained as the degree j components of the homogeneous epimorphisms rpe 1 q rpjq and rpe 2 q rpiq therefore one has well defined augmented koszul complexes c 1 j rk px 1 xe 1 rpe 1 qqsj b 1 0 jj 0 and c 2 j rk px 1 xe 1 rpe 2 qqsj b 2 0 ij 0 as we will see in several circumstances in this paper the exactness of these complexes plays a crucial role in transferring assumptions from ej to jj or ij respectively our first result in this sense shows that if the complexes c 1 j are exact locally up to a certain codimension then the condition that extirpe j rq 0 for finitely many given values of i and j is preserved after replacing ej with jj lemma 3 2 under the assumptions of setting 3 1 let k and s be positive integers with k s 2 assume that piq ext j 1 r pe j rq 0 for 1 j k residual intersections and modules with cohen macaulay rees algebra 9 piiq the complexes pc 1 jqq are exact for all q p specpr 1 q with depthr 1 q s 1 and all 1 j k then ext j 1 r 1 pjj r 1 q 0 for 1 j k proof fix j with 1 j k for i j let c 1 i zi bi and hi be the ith module cycle boundary and homology of the complex c 1 j rk px 1 xe 1 rpe 1 qqsj b 1 0 jj 0 respectively by assumption i we know that ext j 1 i r 1 pc 1 i r 1 q 0 for 0 i j also assumption ii implies that gradehi s k 2 hence ext n r 1 phi r 1 q 0 for all n k 1 and all 0 i j now by decreasing induction on i j we prove that ext j 1 i r 1 pbi 1 r 1 q 0 for 0 i j the assertion will then follow by the case i 0 assume that i j since bj impb 1 j 1 q 0 and ext n r 1 phj r 1 q 0 for n 0 and n 1 from the exactness of 0 bj zj hj 0 it follows that homr 1 pzj r 1 q homr 1 pbj r 1 q 0 therefore the long exact sequence of ext r 1 p r 1 q induced by 0 zj c 1 j bj 1 0 shows that ext 1 r 1 pbj 1 r 1 q 0 as well now assume that j i 1 and ext j i r 1 pbi r 1 q 0 since extnr 1 phi r 1 q 0 for n j i and n j i 1 it follows that ext j i r 1 pzi r 1 q ext j i r 1 pbi r 1 q 0 so the long exact sequence of ext r 1 p r 1 q induced by 0 zi c 1 i bi 1 0 shows that ext j 1 i r 1 pbi 1 r 1 q 0 and the proof is complete we are now ready to prove our first main result which is a module version of theorem 2 12 and will be crucial in order to study the cohen macaulay property of rees algebras of modules in section 4 theorem 3 3 let r be a local gorenstein ring of dimension d let e be a finite torsion free and orientable r module with ranke e 0 and peq assume that e is g e 2 and that ext j 1 r pej rq 0 for 1 j min t e 1 d 3 u then e is of linear type and e 1 f 1 is isomorphic to an r 1 ideal of linear type proof without loss of generality we may assume that e is not free let e ra 1 ran since e is torsion free orientable and satisfies g e 2 by theorem 2 3 e 1 f 1 j and e 2 f 2 i where i and j are ideals of height at least 2 satisfying g e 2 i e g piq 1 moreover we may assume that g d 1 in fact if g d then i is a complete intersection hence it is of linear type by 12 2 6 then by theorem 2 5 c e and j are of linear type if e 1 then r 2 r and e i an r ideal of height g with 2 g d 1 in fact it must be that g 2 otherwise by assumption we would have that ext g 1 r pi g 2 rq 0 contradicting the fact that grade i g 2 grade i g hence g 2 and so i is of linear type by theorem 2 12 if e 2 we proceed by induction on d dimr 1 g 2 if d 2 then g d and we have already proved that e and j are of linear type in this case so assume that d 2 we claim that e 1 q and jq are of linear type for all q p specpr 1 q with dimr 1 q d 1 indeed for any such q let p q x r then ep is a finite torsion free and orientable rp module with pepq satisfying g pepq e 2 and such that ext j 1 rp pe j p rpq 0 for 1 j min t pepq e 1 dimrp 3 u hence by the induction hypothesis ep and jp e 1 p f 1 p are of linear type where e 1 p and f 1 p are constructed as in notation 2 2 by choosing the images of a 1 an in ep 10 alessandra costantini as generators for ep hence their respective localizations e 1 q and jq are of linear type as claimed in particular by theorem 2 6 the complexes pc 1 jqq are exact for all j and all q p specpr 1 q with depthr 1 q d 1 therefore by lemma 3 2 ext j 1 r 1 pjj r 1 q 0 for 1 j min t e 1 d 3 u hence for j in the same range also ext j 1 r 2 pij r 2 q 0 now if 3 g d 1 we could choose j g 2 to obtain ext g 1 r 2 pi g 2 r 2 q 0 but this contradicts the fact that grade ig 2 grade i g so it must be that g 2 whence i is of linear type by theorem 2 12 in the remaining part of this section we show that the assumptions of theorem 3 3 are satisfied by several classes of modules our first example is given by modules of projective dimension one improving the well known result that a module of pro jective dimension one is of linear type when it satisfies g 8 see 1 propositions 3 and 4 18 1 1 and 36 3 4 proposition 3 4 let r be a local cohen macaulay ring e a finite torsion free r module with ranke e 0 and peq assume that projdime 1 and that e satisfies g e 2 then e has no proper reductions and ext j 1 r pe j rq 0 for all j 1 proof without loss of generality we may assume that the residue field of r is infinite let p p specprq be such that dimrp e 1 then ep satisfies g 8 and has projective dimension one hence by 1 proposition 3 and 4 it follows that rpepq spepq is a complete intersection in particular ep is of linear type and projdime j p j for all j 1 hence ext j 1 rp pep rpq 0 for all j 1 now let u be a minimal reduction of e generated by general elements since for all p p specprq with dimrp e 1 ep is of linear type then for any such p one has pe uqp 0 hence htpf 0 pe uqq e 2 where f 0 pe uq is the 0 th fitting ideal of e u on the other hand since e u is generated by peq elements by eagon northcott s theorem 9 theorem 3 if f 0 pe uq r we would have that htpf 0 pe uqq e 1 this is a contradiction hence it must be that e u in which case e has no proper reductions and peq in fact since pepq for every p p specprq one can repeat the same argument for a minimal reduction up of ep to show that pepq pepq dimrp e 1 for all p p specprq in particular e satisfies g 8 and the argument at the beginning of the proof then finally proves that ext j 1 r pe j rq 0 for all j 1 another class of modules satisfying theorem 3 3 can be constructed using strongly cohen macaulay ideals recall that an ideal i in a local cohen macaulay ring r is strongly cohen macaulay if all of its koszul homologies are cohen macaulay r modules 20 proposition 3 5 let r be a local gorenstein ring with dimr d let i be a strongly cohen macaulay ideal of height two with piq satisfying g 1 let f be a free r module of rank e 1 0 and let e i f then peq e 1 e satisfies g peq e 2 and ext j 1 r pej rq 0 for 1 j peq e 1 proof notice that e i f is a torsion free r module with ranke e and satisfies g 1 since i does moreover since spf q is a polynomial ring in e 1 residual intersections and modules with cohen macaulay rees algebra 11 variables over r the special fiber ring fpeq fpiq br spf q has dimension peq e 1 in particular e satisfies g peq e 2 now since i is strongly cohen macaulay of height 2 and satisfies g 1 by 37 2 10 we have that depth ij d j for 1 j since r is gorenstein then ext j 1 r pij rq 0 for 1 j and thus i is of linear type by theorem 2 12 in particular for all j rspeqsj rrpiq br spf qsj 0 i j pii br f j iq is a torsion free r module therefore ej rspeqsj 0 i j pii br f j iq whence ext j 1 r pe j rq 0 for 1 j peq e 1 we now provide a general technique to construct modules of linear type as submodules of modules that satisfy theorem 3 3 theorem 3 6 let r be a local gorenstein ring let m be a finite torsion free r module with rankm e 0 and pmq assume that ext j 1 r pm j rq 0 for 1 j min t e 1 d 3 u and that m satisfies g e 2 let e be an orientable submodule of m with dim pm eq max t d e 2 0 u if d e 1 assume also that e is generated by elements then e is of linear type proof we may assume that d 0 we show that e satisfies the assumptions of theorem 3 3 first notice that since dimpm eq max t d e 2 0 u it follows that ep mp for every prime ideal p with dimrp min t e 2 d u in particular e has a rank and ranke e moreover e is g e 2 this is clear from the discussion above if d e 2 otherwise by proposition 2 1 one must have that d e 1 in which case the discussion above shows that e satisfies gd since by assumption peq it follows that actually e is g e 2 as claimed moreover since peq peq then e satisfies g peq e 2 therefore it only remains to show that our assumptions imply the vanishing of the ext modules in the statement of theorem 3 3 since ep mp for every prime ideal p with dimrp min t e 2 d u it follows that for all j 1 gradepm j ejq min t e 2 d u since r is gorenstein this implies that ext j 2 r pm j ej rq 0 for 1 j min t e 1 d 3 u the long exact sequence of ext rp rq induced by the exact sequence 0 ej m j m j ej 0 then shows that ext j 1 r pe j rq 0 for 1 j min t e 1 d 3 u hence e is of linear type by theorem 3 3 explicit examples of submodulese ofm satisfying the assumptions of theorem 3 6 can be constructed by means of the following lemma lemma 3 7 let pr mq be a local cohen macaulay ring with infinite residue field let m be a finitely generated torsion free r module with rankm e 0 satisfying gs for some s 2 let e be a submodule generated by s e 1 general elements in mm then dimpm eq d s 12 alessandra costantini proof since e is generated by s e 1 general elements x 1 xs e 1 in mm it makes sense to define the module m m prx 1 rxe 1 q since m is torsion free and satisfies gs with s 2 by 6 2 2 a and b it follows that m is a torsion free module of rank 1 and satisfies gs that is m i an r ideal satisfying gs now let j be the ideal generated by the images of xe xs e 1 in i since the xe xs e 1 are general elements by 37 1 6 it follows that j r i is an s residual intersection of i whence htpj r iq s hence dimpm eq dim pi jq dimr htpj r iq dimr s as we wanted to prove corollary 3 8 let r be a local gorenstein ufd of dimension d and infinite residue field let m be a finite torsion free r module with rankm e 0 and pmq assume that ext j 1 r pm j rq 0 for 1 j min t e 1 d 3 u and that m satisfies g e 2 if d e 2 let e be a submodule generated by 1 general elements inside mm while if d e 1 let e be a submodule generated by general elements inside mm then e is of linear type proof since m satisfies g e 2 from lemma 3 7 it follows that dimpm eq d e 2 if d e 2 0 if d e 1 moreover e is orientable since r is assumed to be a ufd therefore the conclu sion follows from theorem 3 6 combining the latter result with proposition 3 4 and proposition 3 5 respec tively we have the following corollaries corollary 3 9 let r be a local gorenstein ufd of dimension d and infinite residue field let m be a finite r module with rankm e 0 pmq and projdimm 1 satisfying g e 2 if d e 2 let e be a submodule generated by 1 general elements inside mm while if d e 1 let e be a submodule generated by general elements inside mm then e is of linear type corollary 3 10 let r be a local gorenstein ufd of dimension d and infinite residue field let i be a strongly cohen macaulay ideal of height two with piq satisfying g 1 f a free r module of rank e 1 0 and let m i f if d e 2 let e be a submodule generated by 1 general elements inside mm while if d e 1 let e be a submodule generated by general elements inside mm then e is of linear type finally notice that since r is gorenstein the assumption that ext j 1 r pej rq 0 for 1 j min t e 1 d 3 u in theorem 3 3 is always satisfied if depthej d j for 1 j e 1 a condition that reminds of theorem 2 11 in fact theorem 4 11 at the end of the next section will provide a stronger result which extends theorem 2 11 to modules in order to prove theorem 4 11 we first need to understand how lower bounds on the depths of powers of a module behave under passage to a generic bourbaki ideal which we will discuss in section 4 residual intersections and modules with cohen macaulay rees algebra 13 4 modules with cohen macaulay rees algebra in this section we study the cohen macaulay property of rees algebras of mod ules our main goal is to show that the rees algebra rpeq of a module e is cohen macaulay if finitely many powers of e have sufficiently high depth so that we recover theorem 1 1 in the case when e is an ideal with the assumptions and notations of setting 3 1 the first step is to show that lower bounds on the depths of finitely many powers ej are preserved when passing to ij where i is a generic bourbaki ideal of e similarly as in the proof of theorem 3 3 the exactness of the complexes c 1 j rk px 1 xe 1 rpe 1 qqsj b 1 0 jj 0 and c 2 j rk px 1 xe 1 rpe 2 qqsj b 2 0 ij 0 described in section 3 will be crucial as explained in the following lemma lemma 4 1 under the assumptions of setting 3 1 let k and s be integers such that depthej s j for 0 j k if the complexes c 2 j are exact for 0 j k then depth ij s j for 0 j k proof fix j with 0 j k for 0 i j let c 2 i and bi be the ith module and boundary of the complex c 2 j respectively from our assumptions it follows that depth pe 2 qj s j for 0 j k hence by the depth lemma for 0 i j one has that depthc 2 i s j i now this implies that depthbi 1 s j i for all 0 i j which can be proved by decreasing induction on i using again the depth lemma the next lemma clarifies how the complexes c 1 j may fail to be exact lemma 4 2 under the assumptions of setting 3 1 let k and s be integers such that 0 k s assume that depthej d s k j for 0 j k then for all 0 j k and every minimal prime q in supp j i 0 hipc 1 jq dimr 1 q s proof fix j with 0 j k and suppose that dimr 1 q s 1 for some prime ideal q as in the statement we will prove that pc 1 jqq is exact and this will contradict the fact that hipc 1 jqq 0 for some i with 0 i j first notice that hipc 1 jqq is zero or has depth zero for all 0 i j since q is minimal in supp j i 0 hipc 1 jq now let p q x r since rp r 1 q is a flat local map then dimr 1 q depthpe 1 q qj dimrp depth pepq j d depthej 25 theorem 15 1 theorem 23 3 and exercise 17 5 hence from our assumption on depthej i it follows that depthpe 1 q qj i dimr 1 q s k j i i 1 hence pc 1 jqq is acyclic by the acyclicity lemma and therefore it is exact since h 1 pc 1 jq 0 by construction we are now ready to state and prove the desired generalization of theorem 1 1 theorem 4 3 let r be a local gorenstein ring of dimension d with infinite residue field let e be a finite torsion free orientable r module with ranke e 0 and peq let g be the height of a generic bourbaki ideal of e and assume that the following conditions hold 14 alessandra costantini paq e satisfies g e 1 pbq rpeq k for some integer 1 k e pcq depthej d g j 2 for 1 j e k g 1 d e k j for e k g 2 j k pdq if g 2 ext j 1 rp pe j p rpq 0 for e k j e 3 and for all p p specprq with dimrp e such that ep is not free then rpeq is cohen macaulay proof let e ra 1 ran by theorem 2 3 e admits a generic bourbaki ideal i with hti g 2 and rpiq rpeq k that satisfies g e 1 i e g piq we will prove that rpiq is cohen macaulay so that rpeq is cohen macaulay by theorem 2 5 if e 1 then r 2 r and e i an r ideal with piq and such that depthej d g j 2 for 1 j k g d k j 1 for k g 1 j k since r is gorenstein by theorem 2 10 it follows that i satisfies an k 1 more over all assumptions of theorem 1 1 are satisfied hence rpiq is cohen macaulay now assume e 2 it suffices to prove that depth ij d g j 2 for 1 j e k g 1 d e k j for e k g 2 j k in fact then depth ij d piq k j 1 for 1 j k and by theorem 2 10 i would satisfy an k e i e an piq k 1 hence rpiq would be cohen macaulay by theorem 1 1 notice that depth pe 2 qj depthej since r 2 is flat over r also if g 3 then by theorem 2 3 c i is a free direct summand of e 2 so for every j ij satisfies the same depth condition as pe 2 qj hence as ej thus we may assume that g 2 so that assumption c becomes depthej d j for 1 j e k 1 d e k j for e k j k in particular depthej d e k j for 1 j k and also for j 0 since r is cohen macaulay therefore by lemma 4 1 with s d e k and lemma 4 2 with s e it suffices to show that the complexes pc 1 jqq are exact for all q p specpr 1 q with dimr 1 q e and all 0 j k for each such q let p q x r if ep is free then also its localization e 1 q is free hence e 1 q is of linear type and rpe 1 q q is cohen macaulay so by theorem 2 5 c and theorem 2 6 the complexes pc 1 jqq are exact for all j if ep is not free then by assumption ext j 1 rp pe j p rpq 0 for all p p specprq with dimrp e and all j with e k j e 3 in particular since pepq and dimr 1 q e this is true for e k j min t pepq e 1 dimrp 3 u moreover since rp is gorenstein by assumption c the same vanishing holds if 1 j e k 1 hence ext j 1 rp pe j p rpq 0 for all 1 j min t pepq e 1 dimrp 3 u therefore by theorem 3 3 e 1 p f 1 p is isomorphic to an r 1 p ideal of linear type where e 1 p and f 1 p are constructed as in notation 2 2 by choosing the images of a 1 an in ep as generators for ep therefore pe 1 f 1 qq which is a localization of e 1 p f 1 p is isomorphic to an r 1 q ideal of linear type thus all the pc 1 jqq are exact residual intersections and modules with cohen macaulay rees algebra 15 by theorem 2 6 comparing the statements of theorem 1 1 and of theorem 4 3 it is clear that assumption d in theorem 4 3 is redundant in case e is of rank one moreover in this case assumption c simplifies to pc 1 q depthej d e k j for 1 j k it is then natural to ask what other situations produce similar simplified statements for theorem 4 3 notice that assumption d in theorem 4 3 is vacuously satisfied when k 2 or when e 3 also if e 2 assumption c can be replaced by assumption c above in particular we have the following two corollaries which correspond to the cases when a generic bourbaki ideal of e has analytic deviation at most 1 or at most 2 respectively corollary 4 4 let r be a local gorenstein ring of dimension d with infinite residue field let e be a finite torsion free orientable r module with ranke e 0 and peq let g be the height of a generic bourbaki ideal of e and assume that the following conditions hold paq e satisfies g e 1 pbq rpeq k for some integer 1 k e and e 2 pcq depthej d e k j for 1 j k then rpeq is cohen macaulay corollary 4 5 let r be a local gorenstein ring of dimension d with infinite residue field let e be a finite torsion free orientable r module with ranke e 0 and peq let g be the height of a generic bourbaki ideal of e and assume that the following conditions hold paq e satisfies g e 1 pbq rpeq k for some integer 1 k e and e 3 pcq depthe d g 1 and depthej d e k j for 2 j k then rpeq is cohen macaulay observe also that assumption b of theorem 4 3 implies that rpeq peq e which is a necessary condition in order for rpeq to be cohen macaulay 34 4 2 recalling that peq e d 1 it then makes sense to investigate the cohen macaulay property of rpeq for rings of small dimensions in particular in 34 4 4 and 4 6 sufficient conditions were given in the case when d 5 under the assumption that rpeq 2 and e satisfies gd as a consequence of theorem 4 3 when d 5 we can now give similar results for the full range of non zero admissible reduction numbers assuming that e satisfies the weaker condition g e 1 corollary 4 6 let r be a gorenstein local ring of dimension 4 with infinite residue field let e be a finite torsion free orientable r module with ranke e and peq assume that e satisfies g e 1 and rpeq e then rpeq is cohen macaulay if one of the following conditions holds paq rpeq 1 e and depthe 2 or rpeq 1 e and depthe 3 pbq rpeq 2 e and depthe 2 or rpeq 2 e and depthej 4 j for 1 j 2 pcq rpeq 3 and depthej 4 j for 1 j 3 16 alessandra costantini proof since e d 1 3 if e 3 it follows that e satisfies gd hence if rpeq 2 by 34 4 6 b it suffices to assume that depthe 2 in all the remaining cases our assumptions imply the assumptions of theorem 4 3 with d 4 and k rpeq in fact since rpeq e 3 assumption d in theorem 4 3 is vacuously satisfied and if rpeq 3 then it must be e 3 corollary 4 7 let r be a gorenstein local ring of dimension 5 with infinite residue field let e be a finite torsion free orientable r module with ranke e and peq assume that e satisfies g e 1 let g be the height of a generic bourbaki ideal of e then rpeq is cohen macaulay if one of the following conditions holds paq e 4 rpeq 2 and depthe 4 pbq e 4 rpeq e 1 3 and depthej rpeq 1 j for 1 j rpeq if g 2 assume also that ext 2 rppep rpq 0 for all p p specprq with dimrp 4 such that ep is not free pcq rpeq e 3 and depthej 5 j for 1 j rpeq pdq rpeq e 1 2 and depthej 4 j for 1 j rpeq peq e 3 rpeq 1 and depthe 4 if g 2 2 if g 3 proof in the situation of a e must satisfy gd and the result was proved in 34 4 6 c the remaining claims follow from theorem 4 3 with d 5 and k rpeq by noticing that assumption d is non vacuous only when e 4 finally from the proof of theorem 4 3 it follows that assumption c implies that k e g 2 see also the discussion in 22 page 14 and that the ext modules in assumption d automatically vanish when g 2 and k e g 2 moreover if k e g 1 we only need to assume r to be gorenstein locally in codimension e since the artin nagata property an e k is automatically satisfied when e k g in this case the depth condition in c can be simplified to assumption c these observations prove the following two corollaries for modules with large reduction numbers which recover 11 6 5 and 11 6 4 in the case when e is an ideal corollary 4 8 let r be a local cohen macaulay ring with infinite residue field and assume that r is gorenstein locally in codimension e let e be a finite torsion free orientable r module ranke e 0 peq e 1 2 let g be the height of a generic bourbaki ideal of e then rpeq is cohen macaulay if the following conditions hold paq e satisfies g e 1 pbq rpeq e g 1 pcq depthej d g j 1 for 1 j e g 1 pdq if g 2 ext j 1 rp pe j p rpq 0 for 1 j e 3 for all p p specprq with dimrp e such that ep is not free corollary 4 9 let r be a local cohen macaulay ring with infinite residue field and assume that r is gorenstein locally in codimension e let e be a finite torsion free orientable r module ranke e 0 peq e 1 2 let g be the height of a generic bourbaki ideal of e then rpeq is cohen macaulay if the following conditions hold paq e satisfies g e 1 residual intersections and modules with cohen macaulay rees algebra 17 pbq rpeq e g 2 pcq depthej d g j 2 for 1 j e g 2 notice that corollary 4 9 recovers lin s result 24 3 4 in her proof a generic bourbaki ideal i of e is shown to satisfy the sliding depth property locally in codi mension e recall that an n generated ideal i in a cohen macaulay local ring r satisfies sliding depth if its koszul homologies satisfy depthhj d n j for all j 1 15 moreover ideals with g 8 and sliding depth are of linear type by 13 6 1 in the proof of corollary 4 9 we only require i to be of linear type locally in codimension e instead the improvement ultimately depends on being able to replace the depth condition of theorem 2 11 with the weaker vanishing condition on the ext modules in theorem 2 12 we remark that the assumptions of theorem 4 3 are usually not satisfied for ideal modules nevertheless by modifying the proof of theorem 4 3 we are able to provide a sufficient condition for the rees algebra of an ideal module to be cohen macaulay this is discussed in the following theorem which recovers lin s 24 4 3 with a simplified proof theorem 4 10 let r be a local cohen macaulay ring and let e be an ideal module with ranke e and peq assume that the following conditions hold paq rpeq k where k is an integer such that 1 k e pbq e is free locally in codimension e mint 2 ku and satisfies g e 1 pcq depthej d e k j for 1 j k then rpeq is cohen macaulay proof since e is an ideal module then e admits a generic bourbaki ideal i with ht i g 2 and rpiq rpeq k which satisfies g e 1 that is g piq moreover since e is free locally in codimension e mint 2 ku by theorem 2 13 i satisfies an e mint 2 ku we next prove that depth ij d piq k j 1 d e k j for 1 j k hence by theorem 1 1 it would follow that rpiq is cohen macaulay whence the proof would be complete thanks to theorem 2 5 the depth condition above is clearly satisfied if e 1 so assume that e 2 by lemma 4 1 with s d e k and lemma 4 2 with s e it suffices to show that the complexes pc 1 jqq are exact for all q p specpr 1 q with dimr 1 q e and all 0 j k for each such q let p q x r then ep is an ideal module which is free locally in codimension e mint 2 ku and satisfies g e 1 i e g 8 hence e 1 p f 1 p is isomorphic to an r 1 p ideal which satisfies g 8 and an e mint 2 ku then by 37 1 9 its localization pe 1 f 1 qq satisfies g 8 and an e mint 2 ku whence also an dimr 1 q 2 since dimr 1 q e by 37 1 9 it then follows that pe 1 f 1 qq sat isfies sliding depth hence it is of linear type by 13 6 1 so that the complexes pc 1 jqq are exact for all 0 j k thanks to theorem 2 6 our last goal is to prove the following result which is a module version of theorem 2 11 theorem 4 11 let r be a gorenstein local ring of dimension d let e be a finite torsion free orientable r module with ranke e 0 and peq assume that 18 alessandra costantini e satisfies g e 2 and that depthe j d j for 1 j e 1 then e is of linear type and rpeq is cohen macaulay this improves a result of lin 24 3 1 where the module was assumed to satisfy g 8 and the condition on the depths of powers e j was imposed on a larger range of exponents in order to prove the theorem we will make use of the following preliminary lemma which was inspired by the proof of 24 3 1 lemma 4 12 let r be a cohen macaulay local ring of dimension d and let e ra 1 ran be a finite r module denote rr rrz 1 zns re e br rr and x n i 1 ziai p re for a positive integer s assume that depthej d j for 1 j s then the following statements hold paq for all q p spec rr and for all 1 j s depth re jq x re j 1 q dim rrq j pbq assume furthermore that s d 1 and that p re rrxqq is of linear type for all q p spec rr such that dimrqxr d 1 then for all 1 j s re j x re j 1 re rrx j proof for q p specp rrq let p q x r since rp rrq is a flat local map for all 1 j s we have that dim rrq depth rejq dimrp depthe j p d depthe j j see 25 theorem 15 1 theorem 23 3 and exercise 17 5 moreover by theorem 2 7 x is a regular element on rp req hence on rp reqq therefore for all j 1 we have x rej 1 q rej 1 q hence the conclusion in a follows from the depth lemma applied to the short exact sequence 0 x rej 1 q rej q re jq x re j 1 q 0 now assume that s d 1 in order to prove b by theorem 2 6 it suffices to show that rejq x rej 1 q is a torsion free rr module for all 1 j s equivalently we need to show that depth re jq x re j 1 q 1 for all q p specp rrq with dim rrq 1 let p qxr if dimrp d 1 then by assumption p re rrxqq is of linear type hence by theorem 2 6 it follows that rejq x rej 1 q is torsion free for all 1 j s if dimrp d by part a we have that depth re jq x re j 1 q dim rrq j d j and the latter is at least 1 since d s 1 this completes the proof proof of theorem 3 11 without loss of generality we may assume that e is not free let e ra 1 ran since e is torsion free orientable and satisfies residual intersections and modules with cohen macaulay rees algebra 19 g e 2 by theorem 2 3 e 1 f 1 j and e 2 f 2 i where i and j are ideals of height at least 2 satisfying g e 2 i e g piq 1 by proposition 2 8 by theorem 2 5 it suffices to show that i is of linear type and rpiq is cohen macaulay let g denote the height of i if e 1 then r r 2 and e i so by assumption depth ij d j d j g 2 for 1 j e 1 piq 2 hence for 1 j piq g then theorem 2 11 implies that i is of linear type and rpiq is cohen macaulay so assume that e 2 we induct on d 2 if d 2 then piq d 2 g and i is g 8 this implies that i is a complete intersection thus i satisfies sliding depth hence by 13 6 1 it follows that i is of linear type and rpiq is cohen macaulay assume now that d 2 notice that by theorem 2 11 it suffices to show that depth ij d j d j g 2 for 1 j e 1 piq 2 by lemma 4 1 and lemma 4 2 this follows once we show that the complexes pc 1 jqq are exact for all q p specpr 1 q with dimr 1 q e and all 0 j e 1 in turn by theorem 2 6 we only need to show that pe 1 f 1 qq jq is of linear type for any such prime q for any such q let p q x r then notice that ep is a finite torsion free orientable rp module of rank e and analytic spread pepq moreover our assumptions imply that depthe j p dimrp j for 1 j e 1 hence for 1 j pepq e 1 since dimrp dimr 1 q e 1 d 1 by the induction hypothesis ep is of linear type and rpepq is cohen macaulay now let rp rprz 1 zns ep ep brp rp and x n i 1 zi ai 1 p ep be as in lemma 4 12 since ep is of linear type and rpepq is cohen macaulay by theorem 2 5 c it follows that p ep rpxq is of linear type hence by lemma 4 12 we have that ep j x ep j 1 ep rpx j and that depthp ep rpx q dim rp j for all 1 j e 1 therefore the same conclusions hold after tensoring with the ring s rp m rp where m is the maximal ideal of r in particular the s module psep sxq satisfies the same assumptions as the rp module ep hence we can iterate lemma 4 12 e 1 times to obtain that a generic bourbaki ideal of ep constructed as in theorem and definition 2 4 with respect to the generators a 1 1 an 1 satisfies the inequalities depthpe 2 p f 2 p qj d j for 1 j e 1 the same ideal also satisfies g e 2 hence g pepq e 2 since ep does thus by theorem 2 11 it is of linear type with cohen macaulay rees algebra this implies that ep is of linear type whence finally jq is of linear type by theorem 2 5 c 20 alessandra costantini references 1 l avramov complete intersections and symmetric algebras j algebra 73 1981 248 263 2 m artin and m nagata
