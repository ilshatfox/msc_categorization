of subextensions r s are finite i e r s has the fip property and are boolean lattices that we call boolean fip extensions some characterizations involve factorial properties of the poset r s a non trivial result is that each subextension of a boolean fip extension is simple i e r s is a simple pair 1 introduction and notation we consider the category of commutative and unital rings whose epimorphisms will be involved if r s is a ring extension we denote by r s the set of all r subalgebras of s and set r s r s r s with a similar definition for r s or r s a lattice is a poset l such that every pair a b l has a supremum and an infimum for an extension r s the poset r s is a complete lattice where the supremum of any non void subset is the compositum which we call product from now on and denote by when necessary and the infimum of any non void subset is the intersection we are aiming to study some lattice properties of the poset r s mainly the boolean property as a general rule an extension r s is said to have some property of lattices if r s has this property the extension r s is said to have fip for the finitely many intermediate algebras property or an fip extension if r s is finite a chain of r subalgebras of s is a set of elements of r s that are pairwise comparable with respect to inclusion when r s is a chain the extension r s is called a extension by some authors we will say that r s is chained we also say that the extension r s has fcp or is an fcp extension if each chain in r s is finite clearly each extension that satisfies fip must also satisfy fcp dobbs and the authors characterized fcp and fip extensions 11 2010 mathematics subject classification primary 13 b 02 13 b 21 13 b 22 06 e 05 06 c 10 secondary 13 b 30 12 f 10 06 e 25 key words and phrases

picavet let r s be an fcp extension then r s is a complete noether ian artinian lattice with r as the least element and s as the largest element we use lattice definitions and properties described in 24 our main tool are the minimal ring extensions a concept that was introduced by ferrand olivier 18 recall that an extension r s is called minimal if r s r s an extension r s is called a simple extension if s r t for some t s and a simple pair if r t is a simple extension for each t r s a minimal extension is simple the key connection between the above ideas is that if r s has fcp then any maximal necessarily finite chain of r subalgebras of s r r 0 r 1 rn 1 rn s with length n results from juxtaposing n minimal extensions ri ri 1 0 i n 1 an fcp extension is finitely generated and module finite if integral for any extension r s the length r s of r s is the supremum of the lengths of chains of r subalgebras of s notice that if r s has fcp then there does exist some maximal chain of r subalgebras of s with length r s 12 theorem 4 11 1 1 a summary of the main results any undefined material is explained at the end of the section or in the next sections section 2 is devoted to some general properties of lattices r s mainly in the context of fcp and fip extensions since boolean ex tensions are distributive we have evidently to work on distributive extensions which is done in this section we discuss the decomposi tion of elements of r s into irreducible elements when r s has finitely many atoms and each element of r s is a product of atoms then proposition 2 17 shows that r s has fip and is almost pru fer and theorem 2 11 shows that r s is a simple pair for extensions r s of integral domains ayache considered boolean lattices also called boolean algebras r s that are distributive lattices such that each t r s has a unique complement 1 2 and 3 in particular 2 problem 45 asked under which conditions r s is a finite boolean lattice this question is completely answered in sections 3 and 4 where we get in theorem 3 29 a characterization of boolean extensions in particular theorem 3 1 shows that an fcp boolean extension r s has fip each element of r s has a unique representation by a finite product of atoms and r s a simple pair section 3 is devoted to the study of arbitrary fip extensions the canonical decomposition of a ring extension is crucial it consists of the tower r sr tsr r s where sr resp tsr is the seminormalization resp t closure of r in s see section 3 this de composition allows us to only consider special extensions subintegral boolean fip 3 seminormal infra integral t closed and integrally closed the t closed case is reduced to the context of field extensions and is the subject of section 4 in particular for a field extension k l with separable closure t and radicial closure u such that u t 6 k l theorem 4 2 shows that k l is boolean if and only if k u and t l are minimal k l k t u l k t and k u are linearly disjoint and k t is a boolean lattice boolean separable field extensions needs a special study a striking result is theorem 4 19 a galois finite ex tension hence fip k l is boolean if and only if k l is a cyclic extension whose dimension is square free 1 2 some conventions and notation a local ring is here what is called elsewhere a quasi local ring as usual spec r and max r are the set of prime and maximal ideals of a ring r the support of an r module e is suppr e p spec r ep 6 0 and msuppr e suppr e max r when r s is an extension we will set suppr t r supp t r and suppr s t supp s t for each t r s unless otherwise specified if r s is a ring extension and p spec r then sp is both the localization sr p as a ring and the localization at p of the r module s we denote by r p the residual field rp prp at p an extension r s is called locally minimal if rp sp is minimal for each p supp s r or equivalently for each p msupp s r we denote by r s the conductor of r s the integral closure of r in s is denoted by r s or by r if no confusion can occur recall that an extension r s is pru fer or a normal pair if r t is a flat epimorphism for each t r s the pru fer hull of an extension r s is the greatest pru fer subextension r of r s 28 an extension r s is called almost pru fer if r s is integral or equivalently when r s is fip if s r r 30 theorem 4 6 a poset x is called a tree if x 1 x 2 x 3 in x implies that x 1 and x 2 are comparable with respect to we also say that x is treed a subset y of x is called an antichain if no two distinct elements of y are comparable finally x is the cardinality of a set x denotes proper inclusion and for a positive integer n we set nn 1 n the characteristic of an integral domain k is denoted by c k for a b c in a ring r if c divides a b we write a b c 4 g picavet and m picavet 2 lattices properties of the poset r s 2 1 some definitions on the lattice r s in the context of a lat tice r s some definitions and properties of lattices have the following formulations an element t r s is called irreducible resp irreducible see 24 if t t 1 t 2 resp t t 1 t 2 implies t t 1 or t t 2 an element t of r s is an atom resp co atom if and only if r t resp t s is a minimal extension therefore an atom resp co atom is irreducible resp irreducible we denote by a the set of atoms of r s and by ca the set of co atoms of r s now r s is called a atomic resp atomistic if each t r s contains some atom resp is the product of atoms contained in t 32 page 80 b co atomic resp co atomistic if each t r s is contained in some co atom resp is the intersection of co atoms containing t c distributive if intersection and product are each distributive with respect to the other actually each distributivity implies the other 24 exercise 5 page 33 d factorial resp co factorial if each element of r s has a unique irredundant representation by a finite product of atoms resp a unique irredundant representation by a finite intersection of co atoms an fcp extension is both atomic and co atomic we introduce a definition reminiscent of arithmetic rings 29 definition 2 1 a ring extension r s is called arithmetic if rp sp is a chain for each p spec r example 2 2 the extension r s is arithmetic in the following cases 29 example 5 13 for 2 3 and 4 1 r s is locally minimal 2 r s has fcp and is integrally closed 3 r s is fip subintegral and r m for each m msupp s r 4 r s is fip t closed integral such thatrm mrm sm mrm is radicial for each m msupp s r 5 we also have examples in 31 theorem 6 1 of arithmetic ex tensions of length 2 r s when r s 3 we proved in 29 proposition 5 18 proposition 2 3 an arithmetic extension is distributive the following proposition will make easier many proofs boolean fip 5 proposition 2 4 let r s be a ring extension the following state ments are equivalent 1 r s is distributive 2 rm sm is distributive for each m msupp s r 3 rp sp is distributive for each p supp s r 4 r i s i is distributive for each ideal i shared by r and s 5 r i s i is distributive for some ideal i shared by r and s proof we have obviously 1 3 2 and 1 4 5 1 conversely assume that rm sm is distributive for each m msupp s r then rm sm is distributive for each m max r it follows that the distributivity property holds in r s since it holds in any rm sm proposition 2 5 21 theorem 1 p 172 in a distributive lattice of finite length all maximal chains between two comparable elements have the same length the jordan ho lder chain condition or condition jh in 16 dobbs and shapiro defined a field extension k l of finite length to be catenarian if all maximal chains of fields between k and l have the same length and get examples of catenarian field extensions it follows that a distributive field extension is catenarian proposition 2 6 8 remarks page 9 and theorem 1 7 a distributive extension r s satisfies the upper covering condition ucc which means that for each t u r s such that t u t is minimal then u tu is minimal 2 2 some distributive extensions are simple we are going to show that some special subextensions of an fcp distributive extension are simple before next lemma is needed lemma 2 7 if r s is a distributive extension then r x y r x y whenever y s r x s r y and r r x is minimal proof consider the diagram r x y r x r y r since r x r y r x y and r r x is minimal we get that r y r x y is minimal by ucc there is another diagram 6 g picavet and m picavet r x y r x r y r x y r where r x r y r x y r and r r x is minimal using again ucc we get that r y r x y r x r y r x y is minimal but r x r y r x y r x r y r x r x y r x y by distributivity so that r y r x y r x y is minimal from r y r x y r y r x y we deduce r y r y r x y which implies r y r x y r x y because x 6 r y and then r x y r x y proposition 2 8 let r s be a distributive extension let t r s be a product of finitely many atoms then r t is simple more precisely if t n i 1 r xi where the r r xi are minimal distinct extensions then t r n i 1 xi proof we prove the two statements by induction on n there is noth ing to prove when n 1 assume that the induction hypothesis holds for n 1 and set t n 1 i 1 r xi 6 r so that t r x with x n 1 i 1 xi then t r x r xn with x 6 r and xn s r x deny then r xn n 1 i 1 r xi would imply r xn r xi for some i 1 n 1 a contradiction 32 theorem 4 30 now use lemma 2 7 to get the result 2 3 the lattice r s for an fcp or fip extension proposition 2 9 24 proposition 1 4 4 if r s has fcp then any t r s is a finite intersection resp product of irreducible resp irreducible elements of r s lemma 2 10 if r s is a distributive extension and t r s has an irredundant representation t t 1 tm by irreducible elements of r s resp t u 1 tr by irreducible elements of r s for example by atoms resp co atoms the representation is unique if in addition r s has fcp r s has exactly n irreducible resp irreducible elements if and only if r s n if these conditions hold r s has fip proof 32 theorem 4 30 17 theorem 147 and 23 lemma 4 page 486 combine to yield the result the fip property is then an easy consequence boolean fip 7 theorem 2 11 an extension r s is atomistic distributive and fip if and only if r s is factorial respectively is co factorial if these conditions hold then r s is a simple pair proof if r s is an atomistic distributive fip extension then r s has finitely many atoms and then is factorial by lemma 2 10 conversely assume that r s is factorial whence atomistic let t u v r s obviously t u t v t uv since r s is factorial we can write t i a u j a and v k a for finite subsets a i a j and a k of a then uv j k a so that t uv i a j k a write t uv l a i a j k a then for any l we have a t and a j k a so that there exist some i such that a a and some j k such that a a if j then a u so that a t u t u t v if k then a v so that a t v t u t v in both cases a t u t v which yields t uv t u t v and then t uv t u t v therefore r s is distributive moreover r s has fip since a is finite s is the product of all elements of a now let r s be factorial whence distributive set n a and for a a set b 6 a obviously ca b nn let t r s with t i a for j nn i an easy calculation shows that t jb in a unique way hence r s is co factorial to end assume that r s is co factorial we get that r s is factorial and distributive mimicking the previous proof it is enough to exchange product and intersection and atoms and co atoms in fact we use the fact that r s is co atomistic if these conditions hold then r s is a simple pair by proposition 2 8 the following notions and results are deeply involved in the sequel definition 2 12 7 theorem 4 5 an extension r s is called m crucial if there is some unique m max r called the crucial maximal ideal c r s of r s such that rp sp for each p spec r m theorem 2 13 18 the ore me 2 2 a minimal extension is crucial and is either integral finite or a flat epimorphism lemma 2 14 11 corollary 3 2 if there exists a maximal chain r r 0 ri rn s of extensions where ri ri 1 is minimal then supp s r c ri ri 1 r i 0 n 1 8 g picavet and m picavet lemma 2 15 31 lemma 1 8 let r s be an fcp extension and m msupp s r there is some t r s such that r t is minimal and c r t m if r s has fcp set t t r s msuppr t r 1 and tm t t msuppr t r m we are able to give dual results with t t r s msuppr s t 1 but they do not appear in this paper because they are not used in the sequel proposition 2 16 a subextension r t of an fcp extension r s is m crucial when t tm is such that supp t r max r moreover a is the set of all minimal elements of t in case r s has fip tm has a greatest element s m t tm t proof let t tm be such that supp t r max r it follows that suppr t r msupp t r m and rp tp for each p spec r m hence r t is m crucial if u r s is an atom r u is minimal andm c r u with msupp u r m whence u t since r u is minimal u is a minimal element of t conversely let u be a minimal element of t if u is not an atom there is u r s with r u u then 6 msupp u r msupp u r m implies msupp u r m giving u t contradicting the minimality of u in t therefore u is an atom since s m t tm t we get that t s m for each t tm and r s m whence msupp s m r 6 since rp tp for each t tm and p spec r m we get s m p rp so that msupp s m r m and s m is the greatest element of tm proposition 2 17 let r s be an fcp atomistic extension such that a with msupp s r m 1 mn set am a tm and for each k nn vk k i 1 s mi and v 0 r then the following statements hold 1 r s has fip 2 for each m msupp s r s m a am a 3 for each k nn supp vk vk 1 mk and vk nk 0 is an increasing chain such that vn s 4 for each t r s there exists ti tmi for each mi msupp t r such that t mi msupp t r ti 5 r s is almost pru fer proof 1 since a and any element of r s is a product of atoms then r s and r s has fip boolean fip 9 2 let m msupp s r any element of tm is a product of atoms which are necessarily in tm and then in am it follows from proposition 2 16 that s m a am a 3 let mj msupp s r for some j nn assume 1 k n since vk k i 1 s mi and vk 1 k 1 i 1 s mi we have vk 1 mj vk mj rmj if j k so that mj 6 supp vk vk 1 if j k k 1 then vk 1 mk rmk and vk mk s mk mk 6 rmk so that mk supp vk vk 1 at last if j k then vk 1 mj vk mj s mj mj so that mj 6 supp vk vk 1 hence supp vk vk 1 mk if k 1 n the same reasoning holds the end of 3 is obvious 4 let t r s let i nn be such that supp t r mi i i since t is a product of atoms a for each i i set ti a a tmi then ti tmi and t mi msupp t r ti 5 since r a is minimal for any a a either r a is integral or r a is integrally closed moreover by 31 lemma 1 5 for a given m msupp s r minimal extensions r a for a tm are either all integral or all integrally closed reorder msupp s r such that for some k nn r a is integrally closed for all a tmi and for any i k and r a is integral for all a tmi and for any i k then r vk is pru fer and vk s is integral so that r s is almost pru fer proposition 2 18 let r s be an fcp extension such that t is a tree then 1 the elements of t are irreducible in r s 2 for eachm msupp s r tm is a chain whose least element i m is the only t r s satisfying r t is minimal and m c r t 3 let m msupp s r for each t r s such that m msupp t r we have i m t proof 1 let t t andm msupp s r such that msupp t r m it follows that rm 6 tm and rm tm for eachm max r m let t 1 t 2 r s be such that t t 1 t 2 then we have r ti t for i n 2 giving ti m rm tm for each m max r m and rm ti m tm for i n 2 giving for each i n 2 either r ti a or msupp ti r m b fix i and let j n 2 i case a gives t tj case b gives that ti t in this case either tj r giving t ti or tj t hence ti and tj are comparable because t is a tree therefore t is equal to the greatest element of t 1 t 2 and t is irreducible 10 g picavet and m picavet 2 let m msupp s r and t 1 t 2 tm set u t 1 t 2 so that ti u for i n 2 and then ti m rm um for each m max r m and rm ti m um then msupp u r m therefore u t so that t 1 and t 2 are comparable and tm is a chain by lemma 2 15 there is t r s such that r t is minimal with m c r t obviously we have msupp t r m so that t tm since tm is a chain t is the least element of tm because any u tm is comparable to t and we cannot have u t moreover since any t r s such that r t is minimal with m c r t satisfies t tm we have just proved that there is only one t r s such that r t is minimal with m c r t we set i m t 3 let t r s withm msupp t r for eachm max r m we have rm i m m tm and a maximal chain r r 0 ri rn t where ri 1 ri is minimal for each i nn since m msupp t r there is some i nn such that m c ri 1 ri r by lemma 2 14 let k nn be the least i satisfying this property assume k 6 1 so that m 6 msupp rk 1 r again by lemma 2 15 there is r 1 r rk such that r r 1 is minimal with m c r r 1 from 2 we deduce that r 1 i m so that i m t if k 1 then rk 1 r and rk i m t we will see in proposition 2 21 that under some conditions for an fcp extension r s any element of r s can be written in a unique way as a product of elements of t but remark 2 24 shows that this property does not always hold now we look at some properties of arithmetic fcp extensions theorem 2 19 let r s be an arithmetic fcp extension then 1 r s has fip and r s m msupp s r 1 rm sm 2 tm is a chain for each m msupp s r and t is treed proof clearly rm sm has fcp for each m msupp s r 11 proposition 3 7 a 1 therefore rm sm follows since rm sm is a chain and rm sm has fip for each m msupp s r hence r s has fip 11 proposition 3 7 b by 11 theorem 3 6 a we have r s m msupp s r rm sm but rm sm 1 rm sm holds since rm sm is la chain giving the requested inequality 2 let t 1 t 2 tm so that m msupp ti r for i n 2 then t 1 m t 2 m rm for eachm msupp s r m moreover ti m rm sm for i n 2 so that t 1 m and t 2 m are comparable and so are t 1 and t 2 then tm is a chain boolean fip 11 let t 1 t 2 t t be such that ti t for i n 2 and m msupp s r such that msupp t r m we get for i n 2 that 6 msupp ti r msupp t r m so that msupp ti r m it follows that t 1 t 2 tm which is a chain and then t 1 and t 2 are comparable therefore t is a tree let r s be an fcp extension and msupp s r m 1 mn we will use the maps r s n i 1 rmi smi defined by t tm 1 tmn and m r s rm sm defined by m t tm for each m msupp s r then is injective 11 theorem 3 6 if is bijective r s is called a b extension b stands for bijective proposition 2 20 an fcp extension r s is a b extension if and only if r p is local for each p supp s r the above local condition on the factor domains r p holds in case supp s r max r and in particular if r s is integral proof one implication appears in the proof of 11 theorem 3 6 b which uses 11 lemma 3 5 conversely assume that is bijective and that there is some p supp s r contained in two elements m 1 m 2 max r consider a maximal chain c r r 0 ri rn s where ri 1 ri is minimal for each i nn since p supp s r there exists some i nn such that p n r where n c ri 1 ri by lemma 2 14 in particular p supp ri r which implies thatmj supp ri r for j n 2 since is surjective there is t r s such that tm 1 ri m 1 and tm rm for each m msupp s r m 1 in particular m 2 6 supp t r localizing c at m 1 we get that pm 1 supp ri m 1 rm 1 supp tm 1 rm 1 so that p supp t r now m 2 supp t r is absurd then r p is a local ring for each p supp s r if supp s r max r it follows from lemma 2 14 that each c ri 1 ri lies over a maximal ideal of r and so r p is a field hence local for each p supp s r finally it is standard that maximal ideals lie over maximal ideals in any integral extension cf 22 theorem 44 under an additional assumption next proposition gives a converse to theorem 2 19 set msupp s r m 1 mn for an fcp ex tension r s it follows that the elements of msupp t r are some mi when t r s proposition 2 21 let r s be an fcp b extension 1 for each m msupp s r we have rm sm m t rm m tm rm 12 g picavet and m picavet 2 any t r s is a product of msupp t r distinct elements ei t in a unique way such that ei tmi for each mi msupp t r 3 r s is arithmetic if and only if t is a tree 4 assume that r s is arithmetic then t is the set of irreducible elements of r s moreover r s m msupp s r 1 rm sm proof 1 the following inclusions are obvious m tm rm m t rm rm sm let e rm sm since is a bijection there exists t r s such that tm e and tm rm for each m msupp s r m the result follows from e m t and t tm 2 let t r s from msupp t r 6 we infer that some mi msupp t r since is a bijection there exists a unique ei r s such that ei mi tmi and ei m rm for m 6 mi it follows that ei tmi for each mi msupp t r set ej r when mj 6 msupp t r and e e 1 en for each j nn we get that emj tmj so that e t is the product of msupp t r distinct elements of t the uniqueness of these elements is obvious 3 one implication is theorem 2 19 assume that t is a tree let m msupp s r by proposition 2 18 tm is a chain since m preserves order 1 implies that rm sm is a chain 4 assume that r s is arithmetic then t is a tree it results from proposition 2 18 that the elements of t are irreducible con versely let t r s be irreducible in view of 2 t is a product of elements ei tmi where mi msupp t r and then of only one element of t so that t t now m msupp s r rm sm m msupp s r 1 rm sm r s since is bijective and each rm sm a chain for the definition of the goldie dimension of a distributive lattice the reader may look at 24 p 14 and exercise 8 p 33 we will use the following results proposition 2 22 24 theorem 1 5 9 if r s is an fcp arithmetic extension its goldie dimension is the integer n such that r b 1 bn is an irredundant representation of r by irreducible elements proposition 2 23 let r s be an fcp arithmetic b extension ex tension then the goldie dimension of r s is n msuppr s r proof for each mi msupp s r there exists a unique e i r s such that e i mi rmi and e i m sm for m 6 mi set e boolean fip 13 e 1 e n for each i we get that e i mi rmi so that e r is the intersection of msupp s t distinct elements of r s the uniqueness of these elements is obvious we claim that the e i are irreducible let t t r s be such that e i t t then we have r e i t t giving e i m sm tm t m for each m max r mi and rmi e i mi tmi t mi since r s is arithmetic tmi and t mi are comparable and so are t and t by it follows that e i is the least element of t t and then is irreducible so that n is the goldie dimension of r s by proposition 2 22 remark 2 24 using 11 remark 3 4 b we exhibit a nonb extension for which some statements of proposition 2 21 do not hold we now summarize the context of the above quoted remark let r be a two dimensional pru fer domain with exactly two height 2 maximal ideals n and n each of which containing the unique height 1 prime ideal p of r set r 0 r r 1 rn r 1 rn r 2 rp and r 3 k the quotient field of r since each overring of a pru fer domain is an intersection of localizations 19 theorem 26 2 it is easy to check that r 0 r 1 r 0 r 1 r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 and r 2 r 3 are pru fer minimal extensions moreover c r 0 r 1 n c r 1 r 2 nrn and c r 2 r 3 p which is an ideal of r 2 because p r 0 r 2 it follows that supp k r p n n and msupp k r n n by propo sition 2 20 the map is not bijective since r p is not local the poset t r 1 r 1 is a tree moreover rn kn rn rp k r 1 r 2 r 3 and rn kn rn rp k r 1 r 2 r 3 are chains however n t r 1 r 2 because rn n rp then proposi tion 2 21 1 is not satisfied in the same way proposition 2 21 2 is not satisfied because k is not a product of elements of t in particular some irrreducible element as r 3 k of r s is not in t the conditions of proposition 2 21 hold in the following context and provide us a structure of boolean lattices in proposition 3 14 proposition 2 25 let r s be an fcp extension assume that supp t r supp s t for all t r s then 1 supp s r max r and r s is a b extension 2 t is an antichain proof 1 assume that supp t r supp s t for all t r s we use proposition 2 20 to show that is a bijection let p supp s r consider a maximal chain c r r 0 ri rn s where ri 1 ri is minimal for each i nn since p 14 g picavet and m picavet supp s r there exists some k nn such that p n r where n c rk 1 rk in view of lemma 2 14 in particular p supp rk r and more precisely p supp rk rk 1 supp s rk 1 assume that p is not a maximal ideal and let m max r be such that p m then m supp rk r moreover there is some j k such that m n r where n c rj 1 rj indeed j 6 k because n r p 6 m therefore m supp rj r supp rk 1 r since j k 1 and m supp rk 1 r supp s rk 1 is absurd hence supp s r max r and is a bijection by proposition 2 20 2 let t t t be such that t t and m max r such that supp t r m since t t we get that supp t r supp t r giving supp t r m but 6 supp t t supp t r m implies that m supp t t supp s t therefore m supp t r supp s t a contradiction then two distinct elements of t are incomparable and t is an antichain let r s be an fcp extension in the following we will meet the condition that supp t r supp s t for some t r s here is a theorem which gives a stronger result theorem 2 26 if r s has fcp then supp t r supp s t for all t r s if and only if r s is locally minimal in this case r s is an fip factorial extension proof assume that supp t r supp s t for all t r s by propositions 2 25 and 2 21 r s is arithmetic let t r s there is u r s such that u t r and ut s 28 lemma 3 7 which gives um tm rm and umtm sm for each m msupp s r so that um tm rm sm whence rm sm is minimal conversely if there exists some n msupp t r msupp s t for some t r s we get that tn 6 rn sn so that rn sn 2 but rn sn is minimal a contradiction if these conditions hold then r s has fip by theorem 2 19 and is factorial by propositions 2 21 and 2 16 3 boolean fcp extensions 3 1 general properties of boolean extensions let r s be an extension and t r s then t r s is called a complement of t if t t r and tt s if r s is distributive then t has at most one complement 24 exercise 9 page 33 we denote this complement by t when it exists we recall that r s is boolean if and only if r s is distributive and each t r s has a unique complement t 32 definition boolean fip 15 page 129 in a boolean fip extension r s any t r s is in a unique way a product of finitely many atoms and the intersection of finitely many co atoms to see this use lemma 2 10 32 theorems 5 1 and 6 3 and the fact that r s is a complete boolean lattice in particular if a is an atom then a is a co atom 32 theorem 3 43 next theorem characterizes boolean fcp extensions amid distributive fcp extensions theorem 3 1 let r s be an fcp distributive extension and set n r s then the following conditions are equivalent 1 r s is a boolean extension 2 n a where a is the set of atoms of r s 3 r s 2 n if these conditions hold then r s is fip factorial and a simple pair moreover for each t u r s with t u all maximal chains of t u have the same length proof to begin with r s has fip by lemma 2 10 moreover r s has exactly n irreducible element by lemma 2 10 since any atom is irreducible the equivalences of 1 2 and 3 are a translation of the equivalences given in 33 page 292 if these conditions hold then r s is factorial and a simple pair by theorem 2 11 since a boolean lattice is a distributive lattice the last results comes from proposition 2 5 example 3 2 1 an extension r s is boolean and chained if and only if it is minimal one implication is obvious conversely assume that r s is chained and a boolean lattice if there is some t r s it has a complement t then t t r and tt s implies t t r s since t and t are comparable a contradiction 2 let r s be a boolean fcp extension and x s r we intend to compute r x let ca b 1 bn then r x b y for a unique family y b of co atoms 32 theorem 6 3 so that x b for each b y let b ca which does not contain x then r x 6 b and y is the set of co atoms containing x now r x b y b b y where the b are atoms then r x is the product of atoms which are complements of the co atoms containing x but we also have r x b ca y indeed set t b ca y obviously r x t r and assume that r x t 6 s so that r x t b x for some x ca let b x then r x b y b implies b b for some b y in the same way b b for some b ca y a contradiction then r x t s and t r x 16 g picavet and m picavet 3 by theorem 3 1 an fcp boolean extension r s verifes r s 2 n where n r s but an extension r s may be dis tributive with r s 2 n for some integer n without being boolean it is enough to consider a chained extension of length 2 n 1 the following lemma is needed for the next proposition see the close notion of patching due to dobbs shapiro 15 lemma 3 3 let r s be an fcp extension and m msupp s r for any t rm sm such that rm t is minimal there exists t r s such that r t is minimal with tm t proof let s sm be the canonical ring morphism and set t 1 t then t r s is such that t t m 6 rm so that m msupp t r from lemma 2 15 we deduce the existence of some t r t r s such that r t is minimal with m c r t hence rm tm t m t gives tm t proposition 3 4 let r s be an fcp extension the following statements are equivalent 1 r s is boolean 2 rm sm is boolean for each m msupp s r 3 rp sp is boolean for each p supp s r 4 r i s i is boolean for each ideal i shared by r and s 5 r i s i is boolean for some ideal i shared by r and s proof we have obviously 1 3 2 and 1 4 5 1 conversely assume that rm sm is boolean for each m msupp s r then rm sm is boolean for each m max r it follows that the distributivity property holds in r s since it holds in any rm sm it remains to show that any t r s has a comple ment let m msupp s r then tm has a complement tm in rm sm satisfying tm tm rm and tm tm sm since rm sm is boolean any of its element is a product of its atoms 32 theorem 5 2 then tm i im r i m where the r i m are atoms of rm sm that is rm r i m is minimal by lemma 3 3 for each r i m rm sm there is ri m r s such that r ri m is minimal with r i m ri m m in particular ri m m rm for each m msupp s r m setting t m msupp s r i im ri m we get for each m msupp s r that t m i im r i m tm so that and give tm t m rm and tmt m sm and to end t t r and tt s showing that t is the complement of t therefore r s is boolean boolean fip 17 corollary 3 5 let r s be an fip extension the following state ments are equivalent 1 r s is atomistic and arithmetic 2 r s is boolean and arithmetic 3 r s is locally minimal assume that these conditions hold and let the set of atoms be a a 1 aa where a is some integer then the complement of any t i i ai r s where i na is t j j aj where j na i if in addition r s is integral then r s msupp s r proof 1 2 by proposition 2 3 and the equivalences given in 33 page 292 2 1 by 32 theorem 5 2 and 2 3 by proposition 3 4 and example 3 2 1 assume that these conditions hold we observe that s is the product of all atoms let t i i ai r s where i na since t is a product of atoms the relations t t r and tt s give t j j aj where j na i in case r s is integral we use r s m msupp s r rm sm 12 proposition 4 6 next proposition uses the notation of 4 proposition 10 p 52 proposition 3 6 let r s be a ring extension f r r a faithfully flat ring morphism and s r r s assume that r s is distributive then 1 r s is distributive 2 let t r s be such that r t is irreducible resp an atom in r s then t is irreducible resp an atom in r s 3 in case r t is irreducible for any irreducible t r s and r s is an fip boolean extension so is r s proof 1 the ring morphism s s defines a map r s r s while there is a map r s r s defined by t r r t and such that is the identity of r s by 4 proposition 10 p 52 it is enough to take f s and to observe that if m is an r submodule of s then with the notation of the above reference r m identifies tom rr in particular is injective the same reference shows that t u t u for u t r s it is easy to show that tu t u if r s is distributive it follows that for t u v r s we get t u v t u v t u t v tu tv giving t u v tu tv then r s is distributive 18 g picavet and m picavet 2 let t r s be such that r t is irreducible in r s and let u v r s be such that t uv then r t r u r v so that either r t r u or r t r v which implies either t u or t v and t is irreducible in r s let t r s be such that r t is an atom in r s assume that t is not an atom in r s there exists u r t which yields r r u r t a contradiction then t is an atom in r s 3 assume that r t is irreducible in r s for any irreducible t r s this holds if or is bijective if r s is an fip boolean extension any irreducible element of r s is an atom in r s in view of 33 page 292 moreover r s is also an fip extension since is surjective let t r s be irreducible in r s then r t is irreducible in r s then r t is an atom in r s so that t is an atom in r s by 2 since irreducible elements of r s are atoms the same reference shows that r s is boolean proposition 3 7 an fcp extension r s whose nagata extension r x s x has fip and is boolean has fip and is boolean proof in view of 12 corollary 3 5 r s is an fcp extension implies that s x r x r s so that we can use proposition 3 6 because r x s x is distributive since r x s x has fip the map r s r x s x defined by t t x in propo sition 3 6 is an order isomorphism by 13 theorem 32 let t r s be irreducible then t t x tr x is irreducible so that r s is boolean by proposition 3 6 proposition 3 8 let r s be a ring extension f r r a flat ring epimorphism and s r r s if r s is a distributive extension resp a fip boolean extension then so is r s proof the proof is a consequence of the following facts let f r r be a flat epimorphism and q spec r lying over p in r then rp r q is an isomorphism moreover we have r r s q r q rp sp so that rp sp identifies to r q r r s q s q assume that r s is distributive resp fip boolean then so is rp sp for each p spec r by proposition 2 4 resp proposition 3 4 and 11 proposition 3 7 let q spec r and p f 1 q spec r since rp sp identifies to r q s q we get that r q s q is distributive resp fip boolean for each q spec r it follows that r s is distributive resp fip boolean by the same references indeed in the fip boolean case since r s has fip so has r s because spec r spec r is injective boolean fip 19 proposition 3 9 let r s be an fcp distributive extension the following statements are equivalent 1 r s is boolean 2 any irreducible element is an atom 3 any irreducible element is a co atom proof 1 2 and 3 assume that r s is boolean by 32 theorem 5 2 the irreducible elements of r s are the atoms of r s using complements we deduce that the irreducible elements of r s are the co atoms of r s 2 1 by the equivalences given in 33 page 292 since r s has fip by lemma 2 10 3 2 it is enough to exchange products and intersections and atoms and co atoms theorem 3 10 let r s be an fcp extension the following state ments are equivalent each of them implying that r s has fip 1 r s is boolean 2 r s is factorial 3 r s is co factorial proof 1 2 by theorem 3 1 and 1 3 because by proposition 2 9 any t r s is a finite intersection of irreducible elements and then a finite intersection of co atoms of r s by proposition 3 9 2 1 by theorem 2 11 r s is an atomistic distributive fip extension then use the equivalences given in 33 page 292 3 2 it is enough to exchange products and intersections and atoms and co atoms proposition 3 11 17 theorems 107 and 158 let r s be a boolean extension then u t is boolean for any u t r s such that u t and the complement of v u t in u t is u t v we can now generalize ayache s result 3 theorem 7 in case of an arbitrary ring extension proposition 3 12 when r s has a maximal chain of length n from r to s such that supp s r msupp s r n then r s is fip boolean any maximal chain of r s has length n and r s 2 n proof let r 0 r ri rn s be a maximal chain of r subalgebras of length n for each i nn set mi 1 c ri 1 ri r then supp s r mi n 1 i 0 max r in view of lemma 2 14 it follows that mi 6 mj for each i 6 j so that rmi ri mi ri 1 mi smi is minimal and then has fip so 20 g picavet and m picavet that r s has fip by 11 proposition 3 7 now rmi smi is boolean see example 3 2 1 and so is r s by proposition 3 4 the last results follow from theorem 3 1 let r s be an fcp boolean extension and let r 0 r ri rn s be a maximal chain of r subalgebras of s by proposition 3 11 r rn 1 is an boolean fcp extension and rn 1 s is minimal next theorem gives a kind of converse which allows us to check by induction that an fip extension is boolean theorem 3 13 an fip extension r s which is not minimal is boolean if and only if there exist u t r s such that the conditions 1 2 3 and 4 hold if and only if there exist u t r s such that the conditions 1 4 and 5 hold 1 r s r t u s 2 u s ul l r t 3 l ul is a minimal extension for each l r t 4 r t is a boolean lattice 5 the map r t u s defined by l ul for l r t is bijective moreover if these conditions hold u is an atom t u is a co atom in fact these conditions hold for any atom u and its comple ment t and r t u s proof assume that r s has fip and is not minimal set a a 1 an we will prove the theorem in four steps a r s is boolean 1 2 3 4 b 1 2 3 4 1 4 5 c 1 4 5 1 2 3 4 d 1 2 3 4 5 r s is boolean a assume that r s is boolean set u a 1 r s and t u r s the complement of u so that u t r and ut s moreover t n i 2 ai 32 theorems 3 43 and 5 1 1 let l r s and assume that l 6 u s we have u l the complement of l 32 theorem 5 1 and u l implies l t by 32 theorem 5 1 so that l r t hence 1 is proved moreover r t u s because u l t for some l r t u s leads to the contradiction u t u r 2 each element of r s is a product of some ais by theorem 3 10 let l i i ai u s for some i nn then 1 i because u l if not u l r u is absurd in particular l ul where l i i 1 ai t and 2 follows since ul u s boolean fip 21 3 let l i i ai r t so that 1 6 i by 1 then ul i i 1 ai let l l ul there exists some j nn such that l i j ai by the uniqueness of this writing i j i 1 so that we have either i j or j i 1 giving either l l or l ul it follows that l ul is minimal and 3 holds 4 by proposition 3 11 r t is boolean remark that 1 2 3 and 4 hold for any atom u with complement t in fact we have the following diagram r l t u ul s b assume that 1 2 3 4 holds then is surjective by 2 let l l r t be such that l l that is ul ul since l l t we get that ll r t moreover u ll ul ul ul then l l ll ul ul gives by 3 either ll 6 ul ul so that ll l l or ll ul u s but in this last case ul ll ull ul is minimal a contradiction because ll r t then is bijective and 5 holds c assume that 1 4 5 holds then 2 holds by 5 let l r t since ul u s we get l 6 ul deny so that u l t yields s ut t a contradiction assume that there exists some l l ul it follows that ul ul u ul ul a contradiction then l ul is minimal giving 3 d assume that 1 2 3 4 5 holds for some u t r s and that r t u s 6 if l r t u s then l ul is a contradiction with 3 so r t u s we are going to prove that r s is a complemented distributive lattice we first show that t is the complement of u we get that r u is minimal by 3 so that r u t because u t u would imply u t a contradiction indeed ut s by 2 because the map r t u s defined by l 7 ul is increasing then t is a complement of u now conditions 1 2 and 5 show that r s is a decomposable lattice that is for any l r s there is a unique pair l 1 l 2 r t r u such that l l 1 l 2 see 36 p 57 set l 1 l and l 2 r when l r t set l 2 u and take l 1 r t such that l l 1 when l u s the uniqueness of such l 1 l 2 is obvious in each case then r s is isomorphic as a lattice to r t r u in particular since r t and r u are each boolean and then distributive so is r s by 36 proposition 3 5 1 let l r s r t u s assume first that l r t with complement l in r t because r t is boolean so that l l r and ll t setting l l u we get ll ll u tu s 22 g picavet and m picavet moreover l l l l u l l l u r then l is a complement of l in r s now assume that l u s set l l t r t and let l r t be its complement in r t then l l l l t l l r moreover ll lul ul l ut s gives that ll s then l has a complement in r s so any element of r s has a complement in r s which is unique by distributivity to conclude r s is boolean we are now in position to generalize and improve ayache s result 2 theorem 38 for an arbitrary fip extension using a completely different method we will need next results proposition 3 14 an fcp extension r s such that supp t r supp s t for all t r s is a boolean extension proof by theorem 2 26 rm sm is minimal whence boolean for m msupp s r so that r s is boolean by proposition 3 4 proposition 3 15 let r s be an fcp extension and let t r s such that msupp s t msupp t r then r s is boolean if and only if r t and t s are boolean proof assume first that r t and t s are boolean let m msupp s r then eitherm msupp s t orm msupp t r in case m 6 msupp t r so that tm rm hence rm sm tm sm is boolean by proposition 3 4 in case m 6 msupp s t so that tm sm then rm sm rm tm is boolean by proposition 3 4 therefore rm sm is boolean for each m msupp s r and proposition 3 4 gives that r s is boolean the converse is given by proposition 3 11 3 2 characterization of boolean extensions theorem 3 16 an fip extension r s is boolean if and only if 1 and 2 hold in which case r is the complement of r 1 supp r r supp s r 2 r r and r s are boolean lattices proof if r s is boolean set t r then r t r and rt s so that supp r r supp s r 28 proposition 3 6 and 1 holds the same proposition shows that r r now 2 results from proposition 3 15 conversely assume that 1 and 2 hold then proposition 3 15 implies that r s is boolean boolean fip 23 we get a generalization of ayache s result 2 theorem 38 as a corol lary thanks to the following lemma lemma 3 17 let r s be an fcp extension set x t t r r r s suppt r t suppt t r there is a bijec tion r s x defined by t t r rt for each t r s in particular if r s has fip then r s r r r s proof let t t r r r s then r is also the integral closure t of t in t and in s let t r s set t t r and t rt then t t r r r s if t t then t t r implies t r and suppt r t suppt t r now assume that t 6 t then suppt r t suppt t r 28 proposition 3 6 hence we can define r s x by t t r rt for each t r s now let t 1 t 2 r s be such that t 1 t 2 t t assume t 6 t another use of 28 proposition 3 6 gives that t 1 t 2 if t t then t t r so that t 1 t 2 r it follows that is injective the same reference gives that is bijective corollary 3 18 the extension r s is fip boolean if and only if the two following conditions hold 1 r r and r s are fip boolean extensions 2 r s r r r s proof if r s is fip boolean proposition 3 11 implies that so are r r and r s giving 1 since supp r r supp s r by theorem 3 16 we infer that r s r r r s 28 lemma 3 7 conversely assume that conditions 1 and 2 which are equivalent to those of theorem 3 16 because r s has fip hold the map defined in lemma 3 17 being injective condition 2 shows that r s r r r s therefore there is t r s such that t r s inducing by the properties of that suppr r r suppr s r actually the condition of theorem 3 16 1 asserting that r s is boolean corollary 3 19 let r s be an fip boolean extension where r is a local ring then r s is either pru fer or integral proof use theorem 3 16 and 30 proposition 4 16 by corollary 3 19 and proposition 3 4 the characterization of boolean fip extension r s can be reduced to those that are either pru fer or integral with r local 24 g picavet and m picavet for the pru fer case we recover and generalize some ayache s results on extensions of integral domains 2 proposition 35 proposition 3 20 an integrally closed extension r s is boolean and fip if and only if r s is a pru fer extension and supp s r msupp s r if these conditions hold r s 2 supp s r proof assume first that supp s r msupp s r and that r s is pru fer from 11 proposition 6 9 we infer that r s has fip moreover we proved in 11 proposition 6 12 that under these conditions rm sm 2 for each m supp s r so that rm sm is boolean for each m supp s r by example 3 2 1 and then r s is boolean by proposition 3 4 from 11 proposition 6 12 we deduce that r s 2 supp s r conversely suppose that r s is boolean and has fip then 11 proposition 6 9 implies that r s is pru fer and supp s r is finite since r s is boolean so is rm sm for each m supp s r by proposition 3 4 but rm sm is chained 11 theorem 6 10 it follows thatrm sm is minimal for eachm supp s r by example 3 2 1 so that supprm sm rm 1 for each m supp s r and then supp s r msupp s r completes the proof corollary 3 21 an integrally closed fip extension r s with msupp s r m 1 mn is boolean if and only if r s is locally minimal in this case r s is a b extension proof the two properties are equivalent by the proof of the above proposition since supp s r msupp s r holds in this case 11 theorem 3 6 shows that is a bijection the following definitions are needed for the sequel definition 3 22 an integral extension r s is called infra integral 26 resp subintegral 34 if all its residual extensions r p s q withq spec s and p q r are isomorphisms resp and the natural map spec s spec r is bijective an extension r s is called t closed cf 26 if the relations b s r r b 2 rb r b 3 rb 2 r imply b r the t closure tsr of r in s is the smallest element b r s such that b s is t closed and the greatest element b r s such that r b is infra integral an extension r s is called seminormal cf 34 if the relations b s b 2 r b 3 r imply b r the seminormalization sr of r in s is the smallest element b r s such that b s is seminormal and the greatest element b r s such that r b is subintegral the extension r sr tsr r s is called the canonical decomposition of r s boolean fip 25 three types of minimal integral extensions exist characterized in the next theorem a consequence of the fundamental lemma of ferrand olivier so that there are four types of minimal extensions theorem 3 23 11 theorems 2 2 and 2 3 let r t be an extension and m r t then r t is minimal and finite if and only if m max r and one of the following three conditions holds a inert case m max t and r m t m is a minimal field extension b decomposed case there exist m 1 m 2 max t such that m m 1 m 2 and the natural maps r m t m 1 and r m t m 2 are both isomorphisms or equivalently there exists q t r such that t r q q 2 q m and mq m c ramified case there exists m max t such that m 2 m m t m r m 2 and the natural map r m t m is an isomorphism or equivalently there exists q t r such that t r q q 2 m and mq m it remains to solve 2 problem 45 under which conditions an in tegral extension r s is boolean and has fip the study is quite complicated we are going to use the canonical decomposition of an integral ring extension and proposition 3 4 which allows us to only consider local rings r proposition 3 24 let r s be an integral fip boolean extension where r is local then r s is either infra integral or t closed proof let t tsr be the t closure of the local ring r m in s and let t r s be its complement let t be the t closure of r in t so that r t is infra integral and then t t it follows that t t t r then t r and r t is t closed in the same way let t be the t closure of t in s so that t s is t closed and then t t hence s t t t so that t s and t s is infra integral assume that r s is neither t closed nor infra integral so that t t 6 r s then there are r 1 r t and r 1 r t such that r r 1 is minimal infra integral and r r 1 is minimal inert with both the same crucial maximal ideal m by 14 propositions 7 1 and 7 4 there are two maximal chains from r to r 1 r 1 with different lengths and the same statement holds for r s this contradicts condition jh of proposition 2 5 since r s is distributive then r s is either infra integral or t closed remark 3 25 proposition 3 24 is no longer true if r is not local take a ring r with two distinct maximal idealsm 1 andm 2 and two minimal 26 g picavet and m picavet extensions r t 1 ramified and r t 2 inert with m 1 c r t 1 and m 2 c r t 2 assume that s t 1 t 2 exists so that rm 1 sm 1 t 1 m 1 is minimal ramified and then boolean and rm 2 sm 2 t 2 m 2 is minimal inert and then boolean it follows from proposition 3 4 that r s is boolean although being neither infra integral nor t closed to get such a situation we may take s z i t 2 z 2 s t 1 z 3 s and r t 1 t 2 z 6 s it is well known that 2 is ramified in s and 3 is inert in s then t 2 s is a minimal ramified extension with conductor 2 s and t 1 s is a minimal inert extension with conductor 3 s moreover 2 s and 3 s are incomparable setting m 1 2 s r 2 t 1 and m 2 3 s r 3 t 2 14 proposition 6 6 a shows that r t 1 is minimal ramified and r t 2 is minimal inert with m 1 c r t 1 m 2 c r t 2 and s t 1 t 2 we first consider the infra integral case for which we need the next lemma lemma 3 26 a subintegral fip extension resp seminormal and infra integral r s where r m is local is boolean if and only if r s is minimal ramified resp decomposed proof one implication is example 3 2 1 conversely assume that r s is a boolean lattice the atoms of r s are of the form ri r rxi for i i nn n a where xi s is such that x 2 i m resp x 2 i xi m and xim m because r ri is minimal ramified resp decomposed with m r ri then s i i ri by theorem 3 1 let mi m rxi be the resp one maximal ideal of ri assume that n 1 let i j i be such that i 6 j so that r ri rj with xixj rirj but ri rirj and rj rirj are minimal theorem 3 1 so that xi mi ri rirj and xj mj rj rirj in the decomposed case we may choose xi and xj in order that mi and mj are the needed conductors it follows that mi and mj are ideals of rirj and so is mi mj which contains mimj butmi mj ri rj r this implies that xixj mi mj mi r mj m the maximal ideal of r then xixj m giving s r i i rxi set x xi xj 6 r and rx r rx 6 ri rj we get that x 2 x 2 i x 2 j 2 xixj m resp x 2 xi xj m x m where m m moreover xm xim xjm m so that r rx is minimal by theorem 3 23 and rx is an atom of r s but we have rx rirj so that rx rx rirj rx ri rx rj r a contradiction then n 1 s r 1 and r s is minimal it may be asked if extensions of boolean rings and boolean extensions are linked next result shows that they are quite never linked boolean fip 27 proposition 3 27 let s be a boolean ring and r a subring of s such that r s is a finite extension then r s is seminormal infra integral and r s is boolean if and only if r s is locally minimal proof since s is a boolean ring r s is seminormal integral be cause a boolean local ring is isomorphic to z 2 z the residual exten sions of r s are isomorphisms so that r s is infra integral now r s is finite implies that it has fcp by 11 theorem 4 2 assume that r s is boolean then r s has fip by theorem 3 1 because fcp distributive moreover an appeal to lemma 3 26 shows that r s is locally minimal conversely if r s is locally minimal then r s is boolean in view of corollary 3 5 indeed r s has fip 11 proposition 3 7 next proposition gives a characterization of arbitrary infra integral boolean fip extensions proposition 3 28 an infra integral fip extension r s where r m is local is boolean if and only if there exist x y s such that s r x y where x 2 xy y 2 y m and xm ym m if these conditions hold then r x y r x y proof if r s is subintegral we choose y 0 if r s is seminormal we choose x 0 in both cases we use lemma 3 26 to get the equiva lence from now on we assume that r s is neither subintegral nor seminormal assume that r s is boolean and set t sr 6 r s from proposition 3 11 we deduce that r t and t s are boolean then r t is minimal ramified which implies that t is also local it follows that t s is minimal decomposed by lemma 3 26 so that r s 2 because all maximal chains of r s have the same length 11 lemma 5 4 if u t then u 6 r s so that r u and u s are minimal since u t r we get that r u is decomposed because it cannot be ramified for the same reason u s is minimal ramified let x y s be such that t r x and u r y so that s r x y where x 2 y 2 y m and xm ym m set m m rx which is the only maximal ideal of t so that m t s set m m ry max u we can assume that m u s then xy m m t u m m conversely assume that there exist x y s such that s r x y where x 2 xy y 2 y m and xm ym m so that m r s set t r x and u r y then r t is minimal ramified and m rx is the maximal ideal of t whereas r u is minimal 28 g picavet and m picavet decomposed and m ry max u moreover t u r and tu s since m rx m ry m it follows from 14 proposition 7 6 that r s is an fcp infra integral extension of length 2 so that t s is minimal decomposed and u s is minimal ramified hence r s r t u s by 31 theorem 6 1 and is boolean by theorem 3 13 assume that the preceding conditions hold so thatr s is boolean whence simple by theorem 3 1 since r x y 6 r t u we have s r x y we can now sum up the previous results in order to get a character ization of boolean fip extensions theorem 3 29 an fip extension r s is boolean if and only if for each m msupp s r one of the following conditions holds 1 rm sm is a minimal extension 2 there exist u t rm sm such that rm t is minimal ramified rm u is minimal decomposed and rm sm rm t u sm 3 rm sm is a boolean t closed extension equivalently rm sm is t closed and r m s n is a boolean field extension where n is the only maximal ideal of s lying above m proof from proposition 3 4 we deduce that r s is boolean if and only if for eachm msupp s r rm sm is boolean an appeal to corollary 3 19 shows that this statement is equivalent to the following for each m msupp s r either rm sm is boolean and integrally closed or rm sm is boolean integral in case corollary 3 21 gives that rm sm is boolean integrally closed if and only if rm sm is pru fer minimal in case when rm sm is integral proposition 3 24 says that rm sm is boolean if and only if either rm sm is infra integral boolean a or rm sm is t closed boolean b to sum up if r s is boolean for each m msupp s r either or a or b holds case implies 1 case a implies either 1 or 2 indeed by proposition 3 28 there exist x y sm such that sm rm x y where x 2 xy y 2 y mrm and xmrm ymrm mrm since m msupp s r we have rm 6 sm so that either x 6 rm or y 6 rm if both x y 6 rm setting t rm x and u rm y we get 2 if only one of x y 6 rm we get 1 case b is 3 conversely if 1 holds then rm sm is boolean by example 3 2 1 if 2 holds then rm sm is boolean by proposition 3 28 setting t rm x and u rm y for some boolean fip 29 x t y u such that x 2 xy y 2 y mrm and xmrm ymrm mrm at last 3 is b we now show that for some m msupp s r rm sm is boolean t closed is equivalent to rm sm is t closed and m n is a boolean field extension where n is the only maximal ideal of s lying above m set r rm m mrm and s sm since r s is t closed m r s and s m is local 12 lemma 3 17 it follows that there is only one maximal ideal n in s lying over m so that sm sn 5 proposition 2 page 40 and s n s m then r m r m s m s n is an fip field extension now r s is boolean if and only if r m s m is boolean by proposition 3 4 it follows that the remaining t closed case can be reduced to the case of fip field extensions the case of fields is the subject of the next section because of its complexity proposition 3 30 a ring extension r s has fip and is boolean if and only if r x s x has fip and is boolean proof one part of the proof is proposition 3 7 so assume that r s has fip and is boolean then r x s x has fip if and only if r sr is arithmetic 29 corollary 4 3 if this conditions holds the map r s r x s x defined by t 7 t x is an order isomorphism 13 theorem 32 it follows thatr x s x is boolean since boolean conditions are preserved through to complete the proof we need only to show that r x s x has fip it follows from proposition 3 11 that r sr is finite and boolean but under these conditions theorem 3 29 yields that either rm sr m or rm sr m is minimal for each m msupp s r this means that r sr is arithmetic so that r x s x has fip 4 boolean fip field extensions the characterization of a boolean extension of fields is quite different from those obtained in theorem 3 13 and needs a special study 4 1 fip non separable field extensions we will call in this pa per radicial any purely inseparable field extension we recall that a minimal field extension is either separable or radicial 27 p 371 we will use the separable closure of a fip algebraic field extension in this subsection we only consider fip field extensions indeed a finite algebraic field extension is not necessarily fip for instance a radicial extension k l has not fip when p c k l k x y with xp yp k and l k p 2 30 g picavet and m picavet lemma 4 1 an fip radicial field extension k k is chained proof since k k has fip there exists k such that k k by the primitive element theorem moreover c k p is a prime integer because k k is radicial then the monic minimal polynomial of over k is of the form f x xp n a x pn where a pn for some positive integer n the map 0 n k k defined by m k pm is strictly decreasing let l k k and g x be the monic minimal polynomial of over l then g x divides f x in k x and is of the form g x x pm for somem 0 n because l k l is radicial and then the degree of g x is a power of p it follows that g x xp m pm xpm where pm l by the proof of the primitive element theorem l is generated over k by the coefficients of g x so that l k k p m m then is a bijection and k k is chained we here take the opportunity to correct a miswriting in the proof of 29 proposition 2 3 the sentence it follows that there is only one maximal chain composing k l and it has length n has to be replaced with it follows that any maximal chain composing k l has length n theorem 4 2 an fip field extension k k with separable closure t and radicial closure u such that u t 6 k k is boolean if and only if the following conditions hold 1 k u and t k are minimal 2 k k k t u k 3 k t and k u are linearly disjoint 4 k t is a boolean lattice if these conditions hold then k t u k and u t proof since k u is radicial c k p is a prime integer assume that k k is boolean if t is the complement of t and t the separable closure of k in t then t t t k entails that k t is radicial so that t u but k t t ut gives ut k moreover k u t shows that t u we claim that k u is minimal deny and let u 1 k u be such that k u 1 is minimal since k u is radicial k u is a chain by lemma 4 1 let u 1 t k be the complement of u 1 in k k then k u 1 u 1 uu 1 implies k uu 1 moreover k u u 1 u u u 1 k u if k 6 u u 1 then u 1 u u 1 u 1 u 1 u 1 u 1 k is absurd because u 1 6 k hence u u 1 k so that u 1 is also the complement of u which is absurd it follows that k u is boolean fip 31 minimal then 1 2 and 4 hold by theorem 3 13 3 1 4 we get that u k k t p since k u and t k are minimal radicial but k tu tu t u k and then k t and k u are linearly disjoint 6 proposition 5 a v 13 conversely assume that 1 2 3 and 4 hold then the above conditions 2 and 4 on t and u coincide with theorem 3 13 1 4 so that we can use the diagram appearing in its proof where l k t k l t u ul k then l lu and l t are linearly disjoint 6 proposition 8 a v 14 in particular lu l k t p shows that l lu is minimal as in theorem 3 13 3 let l u k and set l l t which is the separable closure of k l then l l is radicial but ul l is both separable because so is u k by 6 proposition 16 page 45 and radicial because l l is radicial so that l u l u l t then u k ul l k t implies theorem 3 13 2 finally k k is boolean by theorem 3 13 the missing statement k t u k hold by theorem 3 13 hence we need only to consider either radicial or separable boolean field extensions to have a complete answer we recall 20 that a finite field extension k l is said to be exceptional if k is the radicial closure and l is not the separable closure then a finite exceptional field extension k l is never boolean deny using notation of theorem 4 2 u k t implies t l a contradiction proposition 4 3 an fip radicial field extension k k is boolean if and only if k k is minimal if and only if c k k k proof use example 3 2 1 since k k is a chain by lemma 4 1 for the first equivalence the second comes from 27 proposition 2 2 a galois extension k k is minimal if and only if k k is a prime integer 27 proposition 2 2 but this equivalence does not always hold for an arbitrary finite separable extension theorem 4 5 charac terizes minimal separable extensions independently of galois theory contrary to philippe s methods 25 she proved that a separable exten sion k k x is minimal if and only if the galois group of the minimal polynomial of x is primitive 27 proposition 2 2 3 see also cox 9 page 414 for the characterization and links between primitive groups and primitive separable polynomials a non trivial theory 32 g picavet and m picavet 4 2 finite separable field extensions let k l be a finite separa ble field extension whence fip then any t k l is an intersection of finitely many irreducible elements of k l by proposition 2 9 we give an upper bound of k l and recall a result from dobbs mullins proposition 4 4 let k l be a finite separable field extension of degree n 1 then k l bn where bn is the nth bell number 2 10 theorem 2 7 if k is an infinite field then k l 2 n 2 1 proof 1 k l is e tale since a finite separable field extension and then letting be an algebraic closure of k 6 proposition 2 page av 29 shows that the algebra k l is diagonalizable and then isomorphic to n for some integer n but n bn by 12 proposition 4 15 so that k l bn moreover if k l is boolean any irreducible element is a co atom by proposition 3 9 in fact theorem 3 10 says that k l is boolean if and only if any t k l is an intersection in a unique way of finitely many co atoms thanks to principal subfields introduced in 35 and some of their properties we studied in 31 we are able to characterize co atoms of a finite separable field extension and then give a characterization of a finite separable boolean field extension by using 35 from van hoeij klu ners and novocin that gives an algorithm to compute subextensions of a finite separable field extension we recall the notation of 31 ku x is the set of monic polynomials of k x from now on our riding hypotheses for the subsection will be l k x is a finite separable whence fip field extension of k with degree n and f x ku x is the minimal polynomial of x over k if g x lu x divides f x we denote by kg the k subalgebra of l generated by the coefficients of g for any k k l we denote by fk x ku x the minimal polynomial of x over k the proof of the primitive element theorem shows that k kfk of course fk x divides f x in k x and in l x if f x x x f 1 x fr x is the decomposition of f x into irreducible factors of lu x we set f f 1 fr because the f s are different by separability for each nr we set l g x l g x k x g x g x f x in l x the l s are called the principal subfields of k l it may be that l l for some 6 see 31 example 5 17 1 to get rid of this situation we defined in 31 f k l by f l if t f we set f e 1 et e we denote by e the common value of these l s and by e f the set of all distinct principal subfields of k l we set m fe for nt boolean fip 33 for k k l we set i k nr fk x f x lu x we also set j k nt f e for all i k for each nt we set f f f f divides m in l x theorem 4 5 31 theorem 5 5 let k k l then fk x x x i k f x and k g x l g x k x g x g x fk x in k x j k e i k l in particular k l 2 t and k l is minimal if and only if t 1 proof the inequality comes from that any k k l is an intersection of some principal subfields and gives the equivalence the inequality in theorem 4 5 gives a better bound than the one of proposition 4 4 because 2 t 2 n 1 bn thanks to the induction formula bn 1 n i 0 c i nbi in case k l is not a galois extension we get a better bound than the bound of 10 theorem 2 7 corollary 4 6 let k l be a finite separable field extension which is not galois and of degree n then k l 2 n 2 proof let f x be the minimal polynomial of the extension k l and set f x x x f 1 x fr x the decomposition of f x into irreducible factors of lu x since k l is not galois at least one fi is not of degree 1 so that n 1 r i 1 deg fi 1 2 r 1 r 2 it follows that t r n 2 implies k l 2 t 2 n 2 in the following we write k kg where g x x x f x lemma 4 7 for k k k l k k fk x fk x in l x proof assume that k k then fk x k x satisfies fk x 0 so that fk x divides fk x in k x and also in l x conversely assume that fk divides fk in l x since theorem 4 5 implies k i k l k i k l and fk divides fk in l x any f which divides fk divides fk so that i k i k and then k i k l i k l k proposition 4 8 if k k k l then lcm fk fk divides fk k and fkk divides gcd fk fk in l x proof use lemma 4 7 applied to k k k k kk we set d fk k k l then d is a poset for the order defined as follows if fk fk d then fk fk if and only if fk fk in l x which is equivalent to k k by lemma 4 7 in particular sup and inf are respectively lcm and gcd in d 34 g picavet and m picavet corollary 4 9 the map k l d defined by k 7 fk is a reversing order bijection such that sup fk fk fk k and fkk inf fk fk for k k k l proof is obviously surjective and is injective since k kfk by it is reversing order by lemma 4 7 let k k k l we deduce from proposition 4 8 that fkk fk fk fk k let k 1 k l be such that fk 1 fk fk it follows that k k k 1 so that kk k 1 whence fk 1 fkk and then fkk inf fk fk a similar proof shows that sup fk fk fk k we denote by ca k k l k l minimal the set of co atoms of k l proposition 4 10 assume that k l is not minimal and let k k l if k ca there is some nt such that k e moreover for any nt the following conditions are equivalent 1 e ca 2 f is a minimal element in the set f nt 3 e is a minimal element in d x x proof by 31 lemma 5 10 k e for some nt since k is irreducible moreover m x x x f f f x by the defi nition of f 1 2 assume that e l is minimal we claim that f is minimal in the poset f nt deny then there is some nt such that f f so that m divides strictly m we get e e l contradicting e l minimal and 2 holds 2 3 let e for some nt satisfying 2 and assume that e is not minimal in d x x then there is some k k l such that fk divides strictlym it follows that e k by lemma 4 7 but k is an intersection of some e s by theorem 4 5 in particular we have e k e which implies that m divides strictly m so that f f a contradiction with 2 3 1 let e for some nt satisfying 3 assume that e l is not minimal so that there exists some k k l such that e k l using again theorem 4 5 we exhibit some e such that k e l giving e k e then m divides strictly m contradicting 3 and then e ca in case k l is galois we can give a characterization of ca from the galois group of the extension proposition 4 11 let k l be a finite galois extension with n l k i nm peii and galois group g boolean fip 35 1 let k k l then k ca there exists some i nm such that l k pi there exists some subgroup h of g of order pi such that k is the fixed field of h in l 2 ca m proof 1 an appeal to the fundamental theorem of galois theory shows that k ca the group h of k automorphisms of l has no proper subgroup h pi for some i nm since g n there exists some i nm such that l k h pi because k is the fixed field of h 2 for each i nm there exists a subgroup of g of order pi and therefore an element of ca by 1 which yields ca m since each element of ca is some e we can reorder them so that ca e 1 es with s t if k l is a finite separable field extension theorem 4 5 tells us that any k k l is an intersection of some e s that we can suppose irreducible in order to have a boolean extension any irreducible e must belong to ca remark 4 12 an irreducible element is not necessarily a co atom it is enough to take a galois cyclic extension k l such that l k pn n 3 where p is a prime integer then the galois group of the extension is a chain and so is k l with k l n any k k l such that k k 1 n 2 is irreducible but not a co atom we have seen in lemma 4 7 that for each k k l there exists g x x x g x where g x l x is a product of some of the f x and satisfying g fk let g x x x g x where g x l x is a product of some of the f x a necessary and sufficient condition in order that there is k k l such that g fk is gotten for k q in 35 remark 6 a result without proof that we supply for an arbitrary field k proposition 4 13 if g x lu x there exists k k l such that g fk g d g x 0 and l kg deg g proof if g fk for some k k l then k kg by obviously g x 0 moreover l k deg fk deg g l kg conversely if g x 0 and l kg deg g hold set k kg then fk x divides g x in k x since g x 0 moreover l k deg fk l kg deg g so that g fk if g x x x we get that l k this result allows to characterize boolean and finite separable ex tensions using only polynomials with the following result 36 g picavet and m picavet theorem 4 14 let k l k x be a finite separable field extension the following conditions are equivalent 1 k l is a boolean extension 2 for any k k l there is a unique subset t of ca such that fk sup m e t 3 for any g d x x there is a unique subset i ns such that g sup m i proof theorem 3 10 states that k l is boolean if and only if each k k l is of the form k e te for some unique t ca 1 2 assume first that k l is boolean let k k l and t e ca k e te which is unique corollary 4 9 yields that fk sup m e t let t ca be such that fk sup m e t then k e t e and t t follows from the uniqueness property 2 1 assume that for any k k l there is a unique subset t of ca such that fk sup m e t this implies that k e te by corollary 4 9 assume that there is some t 6 t such that k e t e with t ca it follows that fk sup m e t and t t because of the assumption on t therefore k l is boolean by theorem 3 10 2 3 use corollary 4 9 and the bijection scholium here are the different steps in order to check that a finite separable extension k l with minimal polynomial f x is boolean according to theorem 4 14 1 decompose f x into irreducible elements of l x 2 determine the set e of principal subfields 3 determine ca using proposition 4 10 4 determine d using proposition 4 13 5 check if condition 3 of theorem 4 14 holds remark 4 15 1 assume that k l is a finite separable boolean field extension of degree n using the previous notation we have ca s which is also the value of a using theorem 3 1 and proposition 4 4 we get that 2 s bn it follows that if we want to calculate the elements of ca it is enough to calculate the e 1 et and to stop as soon as we get r distinct elements of ca such that bn 2 r 1 2 let k l k x be a finite separable boolean field extension and let ca e 1 es be the set of co atoms of the extension let k k z k k then example 3 2 implies that if k e y where y ca we have y e ca z e moreover k e ca y but since the extension is finite separable there boolean fip 37 exists y l such that k k y then ca y e ca y e e ca z 6 e it follows that fk sup m e y and fk y sup m e ca y we recall that the sup is considered in d the set of the minimal polynomials of the elements of r s proposition 4 16 a finite separable field extension k l k x such that d g x lu x g x 0 g x f x in l x is boolean if in addition k l is galois and k an infinite field then k l is minimal of degree 2 proof for nr we have g x x x f x d giving that there exists some k k l such that g fk with l 6 k because fl x x x it follows that k l is minimal by 31 lemma 5 7 hence k e for some ns let k k l and set fk x x x i f x for some i nr moreover fk lcm i m for a unique i and then a unique subset t l i of ca satisfying the hypotheses of theorem 4 14 in fact the l are all distinct and are the e therefore k l is boolean and k l r by theorem 3 1 because ca a r now if k l is galois any f has degree 1 set n deg f so that r n 1 with the previous notation then k l n 1 and k l 2 n 1 by theorem 3 1 but k is infinite which implies that 2 n 1 k l 2 n 2 1 by proposition 4 4 which gives n 2 there exist finite separable boolean extensions k l such that d g x lu x g x 0 g x f x in l x and k l is not galois take k q and l k x where x 3 2 then k l is finite separable and not galois because not normal indeed the minimal polynomial of x is f x x 3 2 x x x 2 xx x 2 with x 2 xx x 2 irreducible in l x then k l is boolean by proposition 4 16 here is an example of boolean extension where we show how the irre ducible divisors of the minimal polynomial provides the subextensions of a finite separable extension of fields example 4 17 29 remark 5 19 let k q x 6 2 and set l k x which is a finite separable extension of k but not galois the monic minimal polynomial of x over k is f x x 6 2 x x x x x 2 xx x 2 x 2 xx x 2 which is its decomposition into irreducible polynomials over l set f 1 x x x f 2 x x 2 xx x 2 f 3 x x 2 xx x 2 and g x x x f x for 1 2 3 then g 1 x x 2 x 2 x 2 3 2 g 2 x x 3 x 3 x 3 2 and g 3 x x 3 2 xx 2 2 x 2 x x 3 it follows that k 1 k 3 2 k 2 k 2 and k 3 l then l 1 k 1 and l 2 k 2 by 38 g picavet and m picavet 31 lemma 5 10 moreover no subextension k k l is such that g 3 fk since k 3 l let k k l be such that g 3 divides strictly fk in l x then l k deg fk 3 gives that l k 6 so that k k l 3 because fl 3 f 31 proposition 5 8 to end l 1 l 2 k l 3 hence k l k l 1 l 2 k is a boolean lattice by theorem 3 13 and we get the following diagram l l 1 l 2 k l 3 remark 4 18 31 example 5 17 2 let k q and l k x where x 2 3 the monic minimal polynomial of x over k is f x x 4 10 x 2 1 x x x x x x 1 x x 1 set f 1 x x x f 2 x x x 1 f 3 x x x 1 we get k 1 l 1 k 6 k 2 l 2 k 3 and k 3 l 3 k 2 in particular l e for each and l l k for 6 n 3 which shows that k l k l 1 l 2 l 3 l is not boolean because k l 2 and k l 5 6 22 but k l is galois therefore although k l is boolean for n 2 the product k l 1 l 2 l is not boolean we also observe that despite the fact that k l and l l are boolean for n 3 k l is not boolean however we are able to characterize boolean galois extensions theorem 4 19 let k l be a finite separable extension with normal closure n if k n is a cyclic extension with a square free degree then k l is a boolean extension in particular a finite galois extension k l with galois group g is boolean if and only if k l is cyclic whose degree is square free proof we begin to prove the second part of the theorem let g be the set of subgroups of g for h h g we denote by h h the subgroup of g generated by h and h define k l g by k autk l the group of k automorphisms of l for each k k l and g k l by h fix h the fixed field of h in l for each h g the fundamental theorem of galois theory for finite extensions shows that and are reversing order isomorphisms of lattices with 1 therefore k l is a boolean lattice if and only if g is a boolean lattice to conclude use 37 corollary 2 which says that for a finite group g the lattice of its subgroups is a boolean lattice if and only if g is a cyclic group whose order is square free boolean fip 39 now if k l is a finite separable extension whose normal closure is n such that k n is a cyclic extension with a square free degree then k l is boolean by proposition 3 11 because k n is boolean remark 4 20 the last part of the theorem has no converse unless adding some new assumptions as in theorem 3 13 consider example 4 17 the normal closure n of the extension k l is generated over k by x and its conjugates which are the zeroes x jx j 2 x of f x x 6 2 where j 1 i 3 2 then n k x jx j 2 x moreover k n is galois assume that k n is boolean then k n is a cyclic extension by theorem 4 19 set k 1 k j 2 x 2 n since j 2 x 2 3 2 we get that k 1 k 3 k 1 k and we have two subextensions of k n of degree 3 a contradiction for a cyclic extension see 6 av page 81 then k n is not boolean the two next examples exhibit galois boolean field extensions example 4 21 1 let n be a positive integer n 2 in view of 6 av 152 exercice 3 there exists a cyclic extension of q of degree n it is enough to take a square free integer n and to use theorem 4 19 to get a boolean extension 2 let k f 2 z 2 z be the finite field with two elements and let kn be the cyclic extension of k of degree n set l k 30 the subfields of l are the kn where n divides 30 in view of theorem 4 19 k l is a boolean extension because cyclic of degree a square free integer and k l kn n 1 2 3 5 6 10 15 30 proposition 4 22 let k l be a finite galois boolean extension and let t u r s then u t if and only if k tand k u are linearly disjoint with l tu proof if k t and k u are linearly disjoint then t u k so that u t since tu l conversely assume that u t we are going to show how u is build from t since k l is a finite galois boolean extension theorem 4 19 shows that k l is cyclic n l k is square free and so is t k set n p 1 pkpk 1 pr where the pi s are distinct prime integers ordered such that m t k p 1 pk and set l n m since k l is cyclic there exists v k l such that v k l it follows that m l t k v k 1 so that v t k and tv l indeed t v tv l shows that m l dividing tv k gives that l k n ml divides tv k which leads to tv l then v t u under these conditions we have tu k l k ml t k u k which shows that k t and k u are linearly disjoint 40 g picavet and m picavet we can say more about distributive galois extension non necessarily boolean involving a result from dobbs mullins proposition 4 23 let k l be a finite galois extension with degree n m i 1 p ei i the factorization into prime integers 1 10 proposition 2 2 if k l is abelian then k l m i 1 ei 2 if in addition k l is distributive then k l is cyclic k l m i 1 ei and k l n where n is the number of divisors of n 3 if in addition k l is boolean k l m and k l 2 m proof 2 let g be the galois group of k l and g be the set of subgroups of g since k l is distributive so is g then g is cyclic by 32 page 97 and so is the extension k l the first part of 2 comes from 1 since a cyclic extension is abelian moreover there is a bijection between the subgroups of a cyclic group of order n and the divisors of n as there is a bijection between g and k l this gives the last equality 3 assume that k l is boolean then cyclic by theorem 4 19 and n is square free so that ei 1 for each i hence k l m and k l 2 m since k l is boolean by theorem 3 1 in a recent paper 31 we characterized ring extensions r s of length 2 and gave the value of r s it is then easy to characterize an extension of length 2 which is boolean proposition 4 24 let r s be an fip extension of length 2 then r s is boolean if and only if r s 4 and if and only if one of the following condition holds 1 supp s r 2 and supp s r max r 2 r s is infra integral such that supp s r m sr 6 r s and r s m 3 r s is t closed integral such that supp s r m m r s max s and one of the following conditions holds a r m s m is neither radicial nor separable nor exceptional b r m s m is a finite separable field extension and t 2 where t is the number of principal subfields of s m different from r m proof assume that r s is boolean then r s 4 by theorem 3 1 conversely if r s 4 then r s r t u s for some u t r s where t and u are incomparable so that r s is boolean by theorem 3 13 now the second equivalence comes from 31 theorem 6 1 which gives the different cases for a length 2 extension r s to satisfy r s 4 boolean fip 41 references 1 a
