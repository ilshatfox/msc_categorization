a ring r we can ask if this property extends to the polynomial ring over r or vice versa for example it is well known that r is a unique factorization domain if and only if r x is a unique factorization domain if r is not a domain this is no longer true in this paper we survey unique factorization in commutative rings with zero divisors and characterize when a polynomial ring over an arbitrary commutative ring has unique factorization 1 introduction let d be an integral domain it is well known that the polynomial ring d x is a unique factorization domain ufd if and only if d is a ufd of course d is a ufd if 1 every nonzero nonunit of d is a finite product of irreducible elements and 2 if a 1 an b 1 bm where ai bj are irreducible then n m and after re ordering if necessary ai and bi are associates equivalently d is a ufd if each nonzero nonunit of d is a finite product of principal primes suppose that we allow our commutative ringr to have zero divisors we consider the question is r x a unique factorization ring if and only if r is now there are several ways to define a unique factorization ring all of which agree in the domain case first there are a number of ways to define irreducible element and the notion of associates see section 2 for details we define r to be a bouvier 15 galovich 22 unique factorization ring if 1 and 2 defined in the first paragraph hold see definition 5 3 a related type of unique factorization ring called weak unique factorization rings were considered in 1 fletcher 19 defined another type of unique factorization ring and several types of reduced unique factorization rings were investigated in 17 we can also consider rings called factorial rings in which the nonunit regular elements have unique factorization into irreducibles let r be a commutative ring and x an indeterminate over r the main pur pose of this article is to determine when the polynomial ring r x has some form of unique factorization we determine when r x is a factorial ring a unique fac torization ring a weak unique factorization ring a fletcher unique factorization ring or a strong reduced unique factorization ring see section 5 unlike the domain case if a commutative ring r has one of these types of unique factorization r x need not in section 6 we examine the good and bad behavior of factorization in r x where r is one of these types of unique factorization rings in section 2 we begin with a brief review of factorization in integral domains and commutative rings with zero divisors the various types of irreducible elements and 2010

2 d d anderson and ranthony a c edmonds associate relations are defined section 3 reviews some basic facts about polynomial rings that will be used throughout the paper we also discuss irreducible elements of r x section 4 involves the factorization of powers of an indeterminate x over a commutative ring r it is shown theorem 4 3 that x is a product of irreducible elements resp principal primes if and only if r is a finite direct product of indecomposable rings resp integral domains in the case where x is a product of irreducibles this factorization is unique up to order and associates theorem 4 3 while each power of xn has unique factorization into irreducibles if and only if r is reduced and a finite direct product of indecomposable rings theorem 4 5 throughout this paper all rings will be commutative with an identity suppose that r is a commutative ring we denote the jacobson radical nilradical the set of zero divisors and the set of idempotents of r by j r nil r z r and id r respectively an element is regular if it is not a zero divisor 2 a brief review of factorization in this section we first give a very brief review of factorization in an integral domain and then give a slightly longer review of factorization in a commutative ring with zero divisors let d be an integral domain two elements a b d are associates denoted a b if a b and b a which is equivalent to da db or to a ub for some unit u d an element a d is irreducible or an atom if a is a nonzero nonunit and for b c d a bc implies b or c is a unit of d it is easy to see that for a nonzero nounit a d the following conditions are equivalent 1 a is irreducible 2 if a bc for b c d then a b or a c and 3 da is a maximal element of the set of proper principal ideals of d an integral domain is atomic if every nonzero nonunit of d is a finite product of atoms while d satisfies the ascending chain condition on principal ideals accp if every ascending chain of principal ideals becomes stationary it is well known that if d satisfies accp then d is atomic but the converse need not hold for a review of factorization in an integral domain the reader is referred to 4 and 23 the terminology and general theory of factorization for commutative rings with zero divisors is less standard a general approach to factorization in commutative rings is given in 11 also see 2 and 12 we review some of the details let r be a commutative ring two elements a b r are associates denoted a b resp strong associates denoted a b very strong associates denoted a b if a b and b a or equivalently ra rb resp a ub for some unit u r a b and either a b 0 or a 6 0 and a rb for r r implies that r is a unit in r for a b r we have a b a b a b but none of these implications can be reversed while and are congruences on the monoid r is reflexive on r and hence a congruence on r if and only if r is pre simplifiable that is each element x of r is pre simplifiable x xy for y r x 0 or y is a unit of r in 6 the last two associate relations were generalized as follows the elements a b r are strongly regular associates denoted a r b resp very strongly regular associates denoted a r b if a rb and b sa where r s r are regular resp a b and either a b 0 or a 6 0 and a rb for r r implies that r is regular unique factorization in polynomial rings with zero divisors 3 finally r is weakly pre simplifiable if for x y r x xy implies x 0 or y is regular using the three different associate relations we can define three different types of irreducible elements a nonunit a r with possibly a 0 is irreducible or an atom resp strongly irreducible very strongly irreducible if for a bc with b c r a b or a c resp a b or a c a b or a c the nonunit a r is m irreducible if ra is a maximal element of the set of proper principal ideals of r note that the following are equivalent 1 r is an integral domain 2 0 is prime 3 0 is irreducible 4 0 is strongly irreducible and 5 0 is very strongly irreducible but 0 is m irreducible if and only if r is a field let r be a commutative ring a nonzero nonunit p r is weakly prime 1 if p ab 6 0 a b r implies p a or p b certainly a prime element is weakly prime and a weakly prime element is irreducible moreover a weakly prime element p is either prime or satisfies p 2 0 for suppose that p is weakly prime and p 2 6 0 suppose that p ab if ab 6 0 p a or p b so suppose that ab 0 now p a b p so p a or p b p and hence p b unless a b p 0 but a b p 0 gives ap 0 likewise we can assume that bp 0 but then a p b p p 2 6 0 so p a p or p b p and hence p a or p b thus p is prime hence a regular weakly prime element is prime also if r is not indecomposable a nonzero weakly prime element p is prime for if p p 1 p 2 r r 1 r 2 is weakly prime but not prime p 2 0 gives p 21 p 2 2 0 hence p p 1 1 1 p 2 but p 6 p 1 1 1 p 2 for more on weakly prime elements see 10 for a nonzero element of r we have the following implications none of which can be reversed prime weakly prime very strongly irreducible 3 m irreducible 3 strongly irreducible 3 irreducible the following theorem summarizes some useful facts about irreducible elements theorem 2 1 let r be a commutative ring 1 for regular elements or more generally nonzero pre simplifiable elements the four types of irreducible elements coincide 2 for a r the following are equivalent a a is irreducible b there is a prime ideal p of r with ra a maximal element of the set of principal ideals of r contained in p and c either i a is regular and a ism irreducible or ii a is a zero divisor and ra is a maximal element of the set of principal ideals of r contained in z r 3 if a 1 a 2 r with a 1 irreducible and ra 1 ra 2 r then a 1 is a zero divisor and a 2 is regular 4 d d anderson and ranthony a c edmonds 4 a nonzero nonunit a r is very strongly irreducible if and only if for b c r with a bc either b or c is a unit 5 suppose that 0 6 a r is very strongly irreducible then ann a j r hence if j r 0 a is regular 6 for 0 6 a r a is m irreducible if and only if either i a is very strongly irreducible or ii ra is an idempotent maximal ideal thus for r inde composable a is m irreducible if and only if it is very strongly irreducible 7 let r be a nonempty family of commutative rings and let a r then a is irreducible resp strongly irreducible m irreduc ible prime if and only if each a except for one 0 is a unit in r and that a 0 is irreducible resp strongly irreducible m irreducible prime however a 0 is very strongly irreducible if and only if each a except for one 0 is a unit in r and that a 0 is very strongly irre ducible in r 0 and is nonzero unless 1 and r 0 is an integral domain proof 1 if x is a nonzero pre simplifiable element then x y x y so x is irreducible if and only if it is very strongly irreducible 2 a b 11 theorem 2 14 a c 5 corollary 1 3 5 theorem 1 4 11 theorem 2 5 5 suppose that 0 6 a r is very strongly irreducible let c ann a for d r a a 1 dc hence 1 dc is a unit for each d r so c j r 6 16 theorem 2 9 7 11 theorem 2 15 each of the forms of irreducibility leads to a form of atomicity the commutative ring r is atomic resp strongly atomic very strongly atomic m atomic p atomic if each nonzero nonunit of r is a finite product of irreducible resp strongly irre ducible very strongly irreducible m irreducible prime elements of r note that if r is not a domain then 0 too is a finite product of the appropriate type of irre ducible elements we collect some facts about atomic rings theorem 2 2 let r be a commutative ring 1 r very strongly atomic r m atomic r strongly atomic r atomic r p atomic r strongly atomic and r satisfies accp and r satisfies accp r is atomic however none of these implications can be reversed 2 suppose that r is indecomposable then r is very strongly atomic r is m atomic 3 r is p atomic r is a finite direct product of ufds and spirs 4 suppose that 0 is a product of n n 1 irreducible elements then r is a direct product of at most n indecomposable rings 5 suppose that r is a nonempty family of commutative rings if r satisfies accp or any of the forms of atomicity then is finite 6 let r 1 rn be commutative rings unique factorization in polynomial rings with zero divisors 5 a r 1 rn satisfies accp resp is atomic strongly atomic p atomic if and only if each ri satisfies accp resp is atomic strongly atomic p atomic b r 1 rn is m atomic if and only if each ri is m atomic and if n 1 and some ri 0 is an integral domain then ri 0 must be a field c r 1 rn is very strongly atomic if and only if each ri is very strongly atomic and if some ri 0 is an integral domain we must have n 1 7 if r satisfies accp resp is atomic strongly atomic m atomic very strongly atomic p atomic then r is a finite direct product of indecom posable rings satisfying accp resp which are atomic strongly atomic m atomic very strongly atomic p atomic proof 1 11 theorem 3 7 2 theorem 2 1 6 3 if r is p atomic every proper principal ideal of r is a finite product of principal prime ideals so r is a ring i e a commutative ring in which every proper principal ideal is a product of prime ideals hence r is a finite direct product of special principal ideal rings spirs and domains thus r is a finite direct product of spirs and p atomic integral domains ufds the converse is clear see 11 theorem 3 6 and the paragraph preceding it 4 11 theorem 3 3 and its proof 5 11 theorem 3 4 6 11 theorem 3 4 7 this follows from 1 4 and 6 3 some simple results about polynomial rings in this section we collect some simple useful results concerning polynomial rings the following characterizations of units zero divisors idempotents and nilpotents and of the jacobson radical and nilradical of r x are well known theorem 3 1 let r be a commutative ring and x an indeterminate over r let f a 0 a 1 x anx n r x 1 f is a unit a 0 is a unit and ai is nilpotent for i 1 2 f is a zero divisor there exists 0 6 c r with cf 0 3 f is idempotent a 0 is idempotent and ai 0 for i 1 4 f is nilpotent each ai is nilpotent 5 j r x nil r x nil r x since id r id r x r is indecomposable if and only if r x is inde composable any finite direct product decomposition of r x arises from a di rect product decomposition of r for a finite direct product decomposition r r 1 rn we may naturally identify r x with r 1 x rn x via the map a 0 i a 1 i x a n i x n a 0 i a 1 i x a n i x n 6 d d anderson and ranthony a c edmonds for an ideal i of r we may also identify r x i x with r i x via the map a 0 a 1 x anx n i x 7 a 0 i a 1 i x an i x n now for a r we may consider a as an element of r or of r x and for example for a b r we may consider a b as elements of r or of r x with the obvious notation we write a r b or a r x b the next result collects some simple results theorem 3 2 let r be a commutative ring and x an indeterminate over r let a b r and f g r x 1 a r b a r x b 2 a r b a r x b 3 a r x b a r b and a 0 or ann b nil r 4 f r x g f rr x g 5 a r b a rr x b 6 r x is pre simplifiable r is pre simplifiable and 0 is primary 7 r x is weakly pre simplifiable r is weakly pre simplifiable hence if r is pre simplifable r x is weakly pre simplifable 8 a is irreducible as an element of r if and only if a is irreducible as an element of r x proof 1 clear 2 clear 3 we may assume a 6 0 suppose a fb for f a 0 a 1 x anx n r x then a a 0 b so a r b gives a 0 u r for i 1 aib 0 so ai ann b nil r hence f u r x certainly a r x b a r b so a rb for some r r suppose c ann b then a r cx b so a r x b gives r cx u r x and hence c nil r 4 this follows from the proof of 6 theorem 18 3 5 combine 1 and 4 6 14 7 6 theorem 18 2 8 11 theorem 6 2 if r is an integral domain and a r and f r x with a f then f r suppose that r has a nonzero nilpotent a then 1 ax u r x so 1 1 ax in fact 1 1 ax thus if r x satisfies a f f r for a r and f r x r must be reduced the converse is also true proposition 3 3 for a commutative ring r and indeterminate x over r the following are equivalent 1 r is reduced 2 for a r and f r x a f f r 3 for a r and f r x a f f r 4 for a r and f r x a f f r proof 1 2 suppose that r is reduced and a f a 0 a 1 x anx n r x let p be a prime ideal of r then in r r p a f a 0 a 1 x a nx n since r is an integral domain a 1 a n 0 so for i 1 ai p p spec r nil r 0 so f r 2 3 4 clear 4 1 this was shown in the preceding paragraph unique factorization in polynomial rings with zero divisors 7 let a r we have seen that a is irreducible as an element of r if and only if a is irreducible as an element of r x and certainly the same holds for prime however the next example essentially 11 example 6 1 shows that this does not hold for the other forms of irreducibility indeed a can be very strongly irreducible and prime as an element of r but not even strongly irreducible as an element of r x but it is easily checked that if a r is strongly irreducible very strongly irreducible m irreducible or weakly prime as an element of r x then it has the corresponding property as an element of r we do not know whether a weakly prime element of r is weakly prime as an element of r x example 3 4 let r z 2 z 4 idealization so r is a one dimensional local ring and hence is pre simplifiable and very strongly atomic let a 0 1 r so a is very strongly irreducible and prime as an element of r so as an element of r x a is irreducible and prime however a is not strongly irreducible as an element of r x in fact a is not even a product of strongly irreducible elements of r x hence a strongly irreducible resp m irreducible very strongly irreducible of r need not be strongly irreducible resp m irreducible very strongly irreducible as an element of r x for let f 1 0 2 0 x r x so a af 2 af f however it is easily checked that a 6 af and a 6 f so a is not strongly irreducible as an element of r x moreover a is not even a product of strongly irreducible elements of r x for if a f 1 fn where each fi r x is strongly irreducible then a irreducible in r x gives that a fi for some i but then fi strongly irreducible gives that a is strongly irreducible a contradiction thus r is very strongly atomic but r x is not even strongly atomic however since r x is noetherian it is atomic note that a af but a 6 af and a r a but a 6 r x a also r is pre simplifiable but r x is not now in general an element can bem irreducible but not very strongly irreducible e g a 0 1 in r z 2 z 2 note that the element a 0 1 z 2 z 2 just defined is strongly irreducible as an element of r x but is not m irreducible in fact it is not even a product ofm irreducible elements ofr x herer x is strongly atomic but not m atomic however we next show that for a nonzero element in a polynomial ring the notions of m irreducible and very strongly irreducible coincide we have already given an example of an irreducible element of r x r z 2 z 4 that is not strongly irreducible theorem 3 5 let r be a commutative ring and x an indeterminate over r let 0 6 f r x 1 f is m irreducible if and only if f is very strongly irreducible 2 r x is very strongly atomic if and only if r x is m atomic 3 suppose that r is reduced if f is very strongly irreducible f is regular 4 suppose that r x is reduced and very strongly atomic then r is an integral domain and hence r is very strongly atomic proof 1 a nonzero very strongly irreducible element is always m irreducible con versely suppose that 0 6 f r x is m irreducible by theorem 2 1 6 either f is very strongly irreducible or r x f is an idempotent max imal ideal of r x so in the second case we have f f 2 g for some 8 d d anderson and ranthony a c edmonds g r x then e fg is idempotent and r x f r x e now e r so r x f r x e x e r x a contradiction 2 clearly follows from 1 3 suppose that r is reduced and 0 6 f r x is very strongly atomic by theorem 2 1 5 ann f j r x nil r x 0 so f is regular 4 by 3 every very strongly irreducible element of r x is regular since every nonzero nonunit of r x is a product of very strongly irreducible elements each nonzero element of r x is regular that is r is an inte gral domain but it is easily checked that for r an integral domain r x very strongly atomic atomic implies that r is very strongly atomic atomic it is well known that r atomic does not imply r x is atomic even for r an integral domain 26 however it is easily seen that if r is an integral domain and r x is atomic then r itself is atomic coykendall and trentham 18 give an example of a zero dimensional quasilocal ring s having no atoms with s x being very strongly atomic note that in 18 the term strongly atomic is used for what we have called very strongly atomic however in this case since s x is pre simplifiable the various forms of atomicity all coincide they also show that if r is a reduced ring with r x very strongly atomic then r is very strongly atomic however by theorem 3 4 4 such a ring r is actually an integral domain and hence trivially r x atomic implies r is atomic if r is an integral domain r x satisfies accp if and only if r does while for any commutative ring r r x satisfies accp implies r satisfies accp the converse is false 25 for an integral domain r a polynomial f r x is indecomposable if it is not a product of two polynomials of positive degree this is equivalent to f gh g h r x implies g r or h r which may be restated as f gh implies g r x a or h r x a for some a r certainly an irreducible polynomial is indecomposable but 2 x 4 z x is indecomposable but not irreducible any polynomial of degree at most one is indecomposable and any polynomial is a product of indecomposable polynomials with this definition the zero polynomial is indecomposable we would like to extend the definition of an indecomposable polynomial to com mutative rings with zero divisors in general the condition that f must not be a product of two polynomials of positive degree is very strong for if r has nonzero nilpotent elements r x has units of positive degree and hence if a r is a factor of f so is au for any unit u r x with this in mind we define f r x to be indecomposable if f gh for g h r x implies g r x a or h r x a for some a r we next collect some facts about indecomposable polynomials theorem 3 6 let r be a commutative ring and x an indeterminate let f r x 1 f very strongly irreducible f is indecomposable 2 for r reduced f is indecomposable f is not a product of two polynomials of positive degree 3 0 is indecomposable 0 is irreducible or equivalently prime proof unique factorization in polynomial rings with zero divisors 9 1 suppose that f is very strongly irreducible if f 0 this follows from 3 so suppose f 6 0 now f gh for g h r x implies f or g is a unit in r x and hence is very strongly associated with 1 in r x 2 suppose that r is reduced then u r x u r r thus f gh g r x a or h r x a for some a r is equivalent to g r or h r 3 now if 0 is irreducible equivalently prime this gives 0 gh g 0 or h 0 so g r x 0 or h r x 0 so 0 is indecomposable suppose that 0 is not irreducible so 0 ab where a b r 0 then 0 a ax b bx suppose that say a ax r x c where c r then a ax cu where u u r x so we may take u u 0 u 1 x where u 0 u r and u 1 nil r then a cu 0 and a cu 1 so a au 1 0 u 1 hence 0 a 1 u 10 u 1 where u 1 0 u 1 nil r and hence 1 u 1 0 u 1 u r but then a 0 a contradiction we next give some examples of bad behavior of indecomposable elements example 3 7 1 r reduced but x not indecomposable letr z 6 andx an indeterminate over r then x 2 3 x 3 2 x so x is not indecomposable in theorem 4 1 we will see that x is indecomposable x is irreducible r is indecomposable 2 r reduced with a nonzero element of r not indecomposable let s and t be indeterminates over z and let r z s t 3 s st 2 t z s t let x be an indeterminate over r then in r x 6 sx 2 tx 3 here r is reduced so 6 is not indecomposable 3 while very strongly irreducible indecomposable irreducible 6 indecomposable this is a continuation of example 3 4 let r z 2 z 4 idealization a 0 1 and f 1 0 2 0 x so a is prime and irreducible in r x now a af 2 af f hence a af and so af is also irreducible and prime in r x we claim that a and af are not indecomposable now a af f and af af f 2 so it suffices to show that af 6 r x f 6 and f 2 6 r x for any r suppose that af r x c d r so 0 1 0 2 x af c d a 0 b 0 a 1 b 1 x an bn x n where a 0 b 0 u r and ai bi nil r for i 1 now 0 1 c d a 0 b 0 so c 0 since a 0 b 0 is a unit thus a 1 b 1 nil r 0 m gives 0 2 c d a 1 b 1 0 0 a contradiction next suppose that f r x c d r so 1 0 2 0 x f c d a 0 b 0 a 1 b 1 x an bn x n where a 0 b 0 u r and ai bi nil r for i 1 now 1 0 c d a 0 b 0 so c d u r but then 2 0 c d a 1 b 1 nil r a contradiction a similar proof shows that f 2 6 r x c d r 4 factorization of powers of x in this section we investigate when xn is a product of irreducible elements and when this factorization is unique we first show that x is irreducible or equivalently indecomposable if and only if r is indecomposable 10 d d anderson and ranthony a c edmonds theorem 4 1 let r be a commutative ring and x an indeterminate over r 1 x is prime r is an integral domain 2 the following are equivalent a x is irreducible b x is indecomposable c r is indecomposable proof 1 x is prime x is prime r r x x is an integral domain 2 a b suppose that x is irreducible since x is regular it is actually very strongly irreducible by theorem 3 6 1 x is indecom posable b c suppose that x is indecomposable but r is not indecomposable let e 6 0 1 be a nontrivial idempotent of r now x e 1 e x 1 e ex without loss of generality we can assume that e 1 e x r x a where a r so e 1 e x a b 0 b 1 x bnx n where b 0 b 1 x bnx n is a unit of r x so b 0 is a unit of r then e ab 0 so a eb 1 0 hence 1 e ab 1 eb 1 0 b 1 so 1 e 1 e 2 1 e eb 10 b 1 0 a contradiction c a suppose that r is indecomposable let x fg where f a 0 a 1 x anx n and g b 0 b 1 x bmx m are in r x so 0 a 0 b 0 and 1 a 0 b 1 a 1 b 0 then a 0 a 0 1 a 0 a 0 b 1 a 1 b 0 a 2 0 b 1 a 1 a 0 b 0 a 2 0 b 1 put e a 0 b 1 so e 2 e and a 0 e since r is indecomposable e 0 or e 1 if e 0 then a 0 0 so x x a 1 a 2 x anx n 1 g thus 1 a 1 a 2 x anx n 1 g so g is a unit if e 1 a 0 is a unit so a 0 b 0 0 gives b 0 0 then as before f is a unit since the map r x r x given by x x a a r is an automorphism x is irreducible x a is irreducible thus if r is indecomposable each x a is irreducible we next generalize theorem 4 1 to powers of x being a product of atoms we need the following lemma lemma 4 2 let r be a commutative ring and x an indeterminate over r let f r x be a nonunit factor of xn n 1 then f is indecomposable if and only if f is very strongly irreducible proof let f be an irreducible factor of xn since xn is regular so is f hence f is very strongly irreducible by theorem 3 6 f is indecomposable suppose that f is a nonunit factor ofxn that is indecomposable sayxn fg where g r x let f f 1 f 2 where fi r x since f is indecomposable say f 1 a r so f 1 au where u u r x now x n au f 2 g since a is a factor of xn it is regular write f 2 g bmx m bsx s xm bm bsx s m where bm 6 0 since au 0 is regular m n and 1 au 0 bm thus a is a unit and hence f 1 au is a unit so f is very strongly irreducible theorem 4 3 let r be a commutative ring and x an indeterminate over r then the following are equivalent 1 r is a finite direct product of indecomposable rings unique factorization in polynomial rings with zero divisors 11 2 x is finite product of atoms resp indecomposable elements 3 each xn n 1 is a finite product of atoms resp indecomposable ele ments 4 some xn n 1 is a finite product of atoms resp indecomposable ele ments in this case x can be written uniquely up to order and unit associates as a finite product of atoms resp indecomposable elements proof we first do the atomic case the indecomposable case then follows from lemma 4 2 1 2 let r r 1 rm where each ri is indecomposable by theorem 4 1 x is an atom of ri x now identifying r x r 1 x rm x fi 1 1 1 x 1 1 where x is in the i th coordinate is an atom of r 1 x rm x but then x f 1 fm is a product of atoms 2 3 4 clear 4 1 letr r 1 rs suppose thatx n f 1 fm where each fi r x is irreducible since fi is irreducible in r 1 x rs x it has exactly one coordinate that is a nonunit since each coordinate of xn is a nonunit s m since there is a bound on the number of factors in a direct product decomposition of r r is a finite direct product of indecomposable rings the equivalence 1 2 for the atomic case is given in 11 theorem 6 4 suppose that r r 1 rm where ri is indecomposable then in r x r 1 x rm x x x x x 1 1 x 1 1 1 x is a product of m atoms suppose that x f 1 fs where fi is irreducible in r x let fi fi 1 fim where fij rj x so for each i exactly one fij say fiji is not a unit and it is an atom in rji x now in rji x x f 1 ji fiji fsji since x is an atom of rji x as rji is indecomposable fiji ujix where uji u rji x now fi fi 1 fiji 1 ujix fiji 1 fim fi 1 fiji 1 uji fiji 1 fim 1 1 x 1 1 where the first factor is a unit of r x since f 1 fs x x we must have s m and j 1 jm 1 2 m thus the factorizationx x x x 1 1 1 1 x is unique up to order and unit multiplication corollary 4 4 let r be a commutative ring and x an indeterminate over r then the following are equivalent 1 r is a finite direct product of integral domains 2 x is a product of primes 3 each xn n 1 is a product of primes 4 for some n 1 xn is a product of primes proof 1 2 let r r 1 rm where ri is an integral domain then x is prime in ri x so 1 1 x 1 1 is prime in r x r 1 x rm x so x x x x 1 1 1 1 x is a product of primes 2 3 4 clear 4 1 suppose that xn is a product of primes then xn is a product of atoms so r r 1 rm where ri is indecomposable so x is irreducible in ri x and x n is a product of primes in ri x say x n p 1 ps now pi prime gives pi x and since x is irreducible pi x thus x is prime in ri x and hence ri is an integral domain we next determine when each xn has a unique factorization into atoms 12 d d anderson and ranthony a c edmonds theorem 4 5 let r be a commutative ring and x an indeterminate over r then the following are equivalent 1 r is reduced and is a finite direct product of indecomposable rings 2 for each n 1 xn has a unique factorization into irreducibles up to order and unit multiplication 3 for some n 2 xn has unique factorization into irreducibles up to order and unit multiplication 4 x 2 has unique factorization into irreducibles up to order and unit multi plication proof 2 3 clear 3 4 suppose that xn has a unique factorization into irreducibles by theorem 4 3 x 2 is a finite product of irreducibles suppose that x 2 has two different factorizations into irreducibles now either n 2 or xn 2 is a product of irreducibles thus xn x 2 xn 2 also has two different factorizations into irreducibles a contradiction 4 1 by theorem 4 3 r is a finite direct product of indecomposable rings say r r 1 rm suppose that r is not reduced hence some ri is not reduced let 0 6 a ri with a 2 0 then in ri x x 2 x x x a x a are two different atomic factorizations of x 2 but this leads to two different atomic factorizations of x 2 in r x a contradiction 1 2 since r is a finite direct product of indecomposable rings xn is a product of atoms since r is reduced u r x u r suppose that r r 1 rm where each ri is indecomposable an easy modification of the proof in theorem 4 3 that x has a unique factorizations shows that if xn has a unique factorization into atoms in each ri x then x n has a unique factorization into atoms in r x thus we may assume that r is a reduced indecomposable ring since x has a unique factorization into atoms by theorem 4 3 we may assume that n 2 let f a 0 a 1 x asx s be an irreducible factor of xn say xn fg where g b 0 b 1 x btx t then 0 a 0 b 0 a 0 b 1 a 1 b 0 a 0 bn 1 a 1 bn 2 an 1 b 0 and a 0 bn a 1 bn 1 anb 0 1 now suppose that we have shown that 0 a 0 b 0 a 0 b 1 a 0 bi where 0 i n 2 then 0 a 0 0 a 0 a 0 bi 1 a 1 bi ai 1 b 0 a 2 0 bi 1 a 1 a 0 bi ai 1 a 0 b 0 a 2 0 bi 1 then a 0 bi 1 2 0 so a 0 bi 1 0 since r is reduced hence 0 a 0 b 0 a 0 b 1 a 0 bn 1 so a 0 a 0 1 a 0 a 0 bn a 1 bn 1 anb 0 a 2 0 bn a 1 a 0 bn 1 ana 0 b 0 a 2 0 bn so e a 0 bn is idempotent with a 0 e since r is indecomposable either e 1 so a 0 is a unit or e 0 so a 0 0 first suppose that a 0 is a unit let p be a prime ideal of r then in r p x a 0 a 1 x a sx s is a factor of xn since a 0 is a unit a 0 6 0 so a 1 a s 0 that is a 1 as p then for i 1 ai p p spec r nil r 0 so f a 0 is a unit a contradiction so e 0 and hence a 0 0 so f a 1 x asx s a 1 asx s 1 x now f is irreducible and regular and hence is very strongly irreducible thus a 1 asx s 1 u r x u r so a 1 u r and 0 a 2 as so f a 1 x where a 1 u r corollary 4 6 let r be a commutative ring and x an indeterminate over r then the following conditions are equivalent 1 r is reduced and indecomposable 2 s uxn u u r n 1 is a saturated multiplicatively closed subset of r x unique factorization in polynomial rings with zero divisors 13 3 for each n 1 the only irreducible factors of xn are uxm where u u r and 0 m n m 1 4 for some n 2 the only irreducible factors ofxn are uxm where u u r and 0 m n m 1 5 the only irreducible factors of x 2 are uxm where u u r and 0 m 2 m 1 it is easy to see that in 2 5 of corollary 4 6 we can replace u r by u r x also let us mention a related result of gilmer and heinzer 24 corollary 7 r is reduced and indecomposable if and only if the set of polynomials of r x with unit leading coefficient is a saturated multiplicatively closed set we have seen that each power of xn has unique factorization into irreducibles if and only if r is reduced and a finite direct product of indecomposable rings the smallest example of a ring in which each xn is a product of irreducibles but the factorization is not unique is z 4 here z 4 x is pre simplifiable so all the forms of irreducibility coincide also z 4 is indecomposable so x is strongly irreducible and hence indecomposable so each ax b where a 1 3 and b z 4 is irreducible and indecomposable now 2 is prime and hence irreducible and indecomposable it is easily checked that 2 x and 2 x 2 are indecomposable the only atomic factorizations are 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 and 2 x 2 2 x 1 2 x 3 now for n 1 xn 2 is irreducible for each n 2 xn xn 2 x 2 2 are two different atomic factorizations of xn now for n 1 x 2 n xn 2 2 so x 2 n has atomic factorizations of length 2 and 2 n it is easily checked that any atomic factorization of x 2 n has length l with 2 l 2 n likewise for n 1 x 2 n 1 x xn 2 2 and it is easily checked that any atomic factorization ofx 2 n 1 has length l where 3 l 2 n 1 for n 1 let l xn m f 1 fm where fi is irreducible the set of lengths of x n it is easily checked that l x 1 l x 2 2 and l x 3 3 belshoff kline and rogers 13 have shown that l x 4 2 4 l x 5 3 4 l x 6 2 4 6 and for n 7 l xn 2 3 n 4 n 2 n for n even and l xn 3 4 n 4 n 2 n for n odd in fact they have determined l xn where r m is a local artinian ring with m 2 0 5 unique factorization in r x it is well known that for d an integral domain d x is a ufd if and only if d is a ufd there are a number of ways in which the notion of a ufd can be extended to commutative rings with zero divisors in this section we investigate when r x r a commutative ring satisfies any of these various generalizations of a ufd while structure theories for certain of these generalizations are known we strive to derive our results from first principles using certain features of r x of course an integral domain d is a ufd if 1 every nonzero nonunit of d is a product of irreducibles and 2 this factorization into irreducibles is unique up to order and associates in the nondomain case we have a number of ways to define associate and irreducible we begin with the following definition definition 5 1 let r be a commutative ring and a r a nonunit two factor izations of a into nonunits a a 1 an b 1 bm are isomorphic resp strongly isomorphic very strongly isomorphic if n m and there exists a permutation sn with ai b i resp ai b i ai b i two factorizations of a into 14 d d anderson and ranthony a c edmonds nonunits a a 1 an b 1 bm are homomorphic resp strongly homomorphic very strongly homomorphic weakly homomorphic if for each i 1 n there exists a j 1 m with ai bj resp ai bj ai bj ai bj and for each i 1 m there exists a j 1 n with bi aj resp bi aj bi aj bi aj note that isomorphic factorizations are homomorphic but the converse may be false even if a is regular for consider the two homomorphic factorizations of x 15 into irreducibles in q x 2 x 3 x 15 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 3 also if e is a nontrivial idempotent of a commutative ring r e e 2 are homomor phic but not isomorphic factorizations of e however if for each nonunit regular element of r any two atomic factorizations are weakly homomorphic then any two atomic factorizations of a regular nonunit are isomorphic each form of atomicity and isomorphic leads to a type of unique factorization ring as given by our next definition definition 5 2 let r be a commutative ring let atomic strongly atomic m atomic very strongly atomic and isomorphic strongly isomorphic very strongly isomorphic then r is an unique factorization ring if 1 r is and 2 any two factorizations of a nonzero nonunit element into irreducible elements of the type used to define are note that for any choice of and an unique factorization ring r is pre simplifiable thus in an unique factorization ring the notions of associate strongly associate and very strongly associate coincide and hence the notions of ir reducible strongly irreducible m irreducible and very strongly irreducible coincide as do the notions of isomorphic strongly isomorphic and very strongly isomorphic factorizations definition 5 3 let r be a commutative ring then r is a unique factorization ring ufr if r is an unique factorization ring for some and hence all in our terminology bouvier 15 showed that r is an m atomic isomorphic unique factorization ring if and only if r is either 1 a ufd 2 an spir or 3 a quasilocal ring r m with m 2 while galovich 22 gave a similar characterization of very strongly atomic strongly isomorphic unique factorization rings so r is a ufr if and only if r is either 1 a ufd 2 an spir or 3 a quasilocal ring r m with m 2 0 since a polynomial ring r x is never quasilocal it follows that r x is a ufr if and only if r x or equivalently r is a ufd however we give a simple proof of this result without the use of the previously mentioned structure theory for ufrs see corollary 5 5 in 11 theorem 4 6 it was shown that for a commutative ring r the following conditions are equivalent 1 r is either a a ufd b a quasilocal ring r m with m 2 0 or c a finite direct product of spirs and fields 2 r is atomic and any two factorizations of a nonzero nonunit element into irreducibles are homo morphic and 3 r is m atomic and any two factorizations of a nonzero nonunit element into m irreducibles are strongly homomorphic and it was noted that this result could be stated for any form of atomicity except for very strongly atomic and for either homomorphic or strongly homomorphic in the statement of this unique factorization in polynomial rings with zero divisors 15 result we cannot replace atomic by very strongly atomic since a direct product of two or more rings where at least one is an integral domain is not very strongly atomic using 11 theorem 4 6 one can show that the following are equivalent for a commutative ring r 1 r is either a a ufd b a quasilocal ring r m with m 2 0 or c a finite direct product of spirs that are not fields and 2 r is very strongly atomic and any two factorizations of a nonzero nonunit element into very strongly irreducible elements are homomorphic or equivalently strongly homomorphic or very strongly homomorphic now since r x has infinitely many maximal ideals using the previously men tioned structure theory we have that the following are equivalent 1 r x is a ufd 2 r x is atomic and any two factorizations of a nonzero nonunit elements into irreducibles are homomorphic and 3 r x is very strongly atomic and any two factorizations of a nonzero nonunit element into very strongly irreducible ele ments are very strongly homomorphic however we will again give a simple proof from first principles see corollary 5 5 another generalization of a ufd was given in 1 a commutative ring r was defined to be a weak ufr if 1 r is atomic and 2 any two factorizations of a nonzero nonunit of r into irreducibles are weakly homomorphic it was shown that the following conditions are equivalent 1 r is a weak ufr 2 every nonzero nonunit of r is a finite product of weakly prime elements 3 r is atomic and every irreducible elements of r is weakly prime and 4 r is either a finite direct product of ufds and spirs or r m is a quasilocal ring with m 2 0 1 theorem 2 3 gives that 1 3 are equivalent while 1 theorem 2 13 gives 1 and 4 are equivalent thus r x is a weak ufr if and only if r is a finite direct product of ufds in theorem 5 4 we give a proof of this without recourse to the structure theorem given in 1 fletcher 19 defined a unique factorization ring in yet another way let r be a commutative ring for r r let u r s r s r r he defined the u decomposition of a nonunit a r as a a 1 ak b 1 bn where ai bj are irreducible ai u b 1 bn for each i 1 k and bj 6 u b 1 b j bn for each j 1 n he then called r a unique factorization ring which we will called a fletcher unique factorization ring if 1 every nonunit of r has a u decomposition and 2 if a 1 ak b 1 bn a 1 a k b 1 b n are two u decompositions of a nonunit element of r then n n and after a reordering if necessary bi b i for i 1 n as any atomic factorization of an element can be refined to a u decomposition it is 2 that is essential note that if a r is a regular nonunit then a u decomposition of a is just a factorization of a into irreducible elements so in a fletcher unique factorization ring any two factorizations of a regular nonunit into irreducible elements are isomorphic we call r a factorial ring if 1 every regular nonunit of r is a finite product of irreducible elements and 2 any two factorizations of a regular nonunit into irreducible elements are isomorphic thus a fletcher unique factorization ring is a factorial ring in 20 fletcher proved that r is a fletcher unique factorization ring if and only if r is a finite direct product of ufds and spirs thus r x is a fletcher unique factorization ring if and only if r is a finite product of ufds we prove this without recourse to fletchers s structure theory in our next theorem it is worth noting 1 theorem 2 1 that r is a fletcher unique factorization ring if and only if 1 r is atomic and 2 any two atomic factorizations of a nonunit possibly 0 are weakly homomorphic 16 d d anderson and ranthony a c edmonds theorem 5 4 let r be a commutative ring then the following conditions are equivalent 1 r is a finite direct product of ufds possibly fields 2 every nonzero nonunit of r x is a product of prime elements 3 every regular nonunit of r x is a product of prime elements 4 r x is factorial that is every regular nonunit of r x is a product of irreducible elements and any two factorizations of a regular nonunit into irreducible elements are isomorphic 5 every regular nonunit of r x is a product of irreducible elements and any two factorizations of a regular nonunit into irreducible elements are homomorphic 6 r x is a fletcher unique factorization ring 7 r x is a weak ufr proof 1 2 suppose that r r 1 rn where each ri is a ufd then each ri x is a ufd and r x r 1 x rn x but it is easily checked that in a direct product of ufds each nonunit is a product of prime elements 2 3 clear 3 4 now a prime element is irreducible so every regular nonunit of r x is a product of irreducible elements moreover since a regular irreducible element is a product of primes it is itself prime but it is well known that the factorization of a regular element into primes is unique up to order and associates 4 5 clear 5 1 since x is a product of irreducible elements r r 1 rn where each ri is indecomposable now r x r 1 x rn x and it is easily checked that each ri x satisfies 5 thus we can assume that r is indecomposable and we must prove that r is an integral domain for then r is a ufd suppose that there exist nonzero elements a and b of r with ab 0 since r is indecomposable x x a x b and x a b are irreducible so x a x b x 2 a b x x x a b are two factorizations of the regular element x 2 a b x into irreducibles that are not homomorphic since x c and x d are associates if and only if c d 6 4 in the paragraph preceding this theorem we remarked that a fletcher unique factorization ring is a factorial ring 1 6 r x is a finite direct product of ufds now certainly a ufd is a fletcher unique factorization ring and it is easily checked that a direct product of fletcher unique factorization rings is a fletcher unique factorization ring thus r x is a fletcher unique factorization ring 1 7 here r x is a finite direct product of ufds and it is easily checked that a finite direct product of ufds is a weak ufr 7 5 if for every regular nonunit any two atomic factorizations are weakly homomorphic they are actually homomorphic the equivalence of 1 4 and 6 of theorem 5 4 is given in 8 theorem 3 8 also see 9 where we use the term ufr for a fletcher unique factorization ring the proof given there involves krull rings corollary 5 5 for a commutative ring r the following conditions are equivalent 1 r x or equivalently r is a ufd 2 r x is a unique factorization ring 3 r x is atomic and any two factorizations of nonzero nonunits into irre ducibles are homomorphic unique factorization in polynomial rings with zero divisors 17 proof 1 2 3 clear 3 1 by 5 1 of theorem 5 4 r d 1 dn where each di is a ufd suppose that n 1 then 0 1 1 and x 1 1 are irreducible elements of r x d 1 x dn x but 0 1 1 0 1 1 x 1 1 are two nonhomomorphic factorizations of 0 1 1 into irreducibles we next discuss a theory of factorization introduced in 17 let r be a com mutative ring by a factorization of a nonunit a r we mean a factorization a a 1 an where u r and each ai is a nonunit a factorization of a is a factorization with 1 which is then omitted the factorization a 1 an is strongly reduced if a 1 an 6 a 1 a i an a 1 an 6 ai 1 aij for any proper subset i 1 ij of 1 n and is strongly reduced if a 1 an 6 a 1 a i an a 1 an 6 ai 1 aij for any proper subset i 1 ij of 1 n so we have strongly reduced 3 strongly reduced reduced 3 reduced and it is easily seen that none of these implications can be reversed note that if a r is a regular nonunit then any factorization is strongly reduced also it is easily seen that any factorization can be reduced to a strongly factorization then r is a weak strongly reduced unique factorization ring if 1 r is atomic and 2 for each nonzero nonunit a r if a 1 a 1 an 2 b 1 bm are two strongly reduced atomic factorizations of a then n m and after re ordering if necessary ai bi and r is a weak strongly reduced unique factorization ring if 1 r is atomic and 2 if a r is a nonzero nonunit of r and a 1 a 1 an 2 b 1 bm are two atomic strongly reduced factorizations of a then n m and after re ordering if necessary ai bi note that in 2 there is no loss in generality in just taking 1 and hence omitting it thus we have r strongly reduced ksks r strongly reducedks r reduced ks r reduced and in the next paragraph we note that the two vertical implications are actually equivalences theorem 3 3 17 gave that r is a strongly reduced ufr if and only if r is a finite direct product of ufds and spirs while theorem 3 4 17 gave that r is a strongly reduced ufr if and only if r is a ufd spir or a finite direct product r d 1 dn where each di is a ufd with u di 1 so in the case of a polynomial ring r x we have that r x is a strongly reduced ufr if and only if r is a finite direct product of ufds and r x is a strongly reduced ufr if and only if r is a ufd or r d 1 dn where di is a ufd with u di 1 we next give simple proofs of these results for r x using theorem 5 4 theorem 5 6 for a commutative ring r the following conditions are equivalent 18 d d anderson and ranthony a c edmonds 1 r x is a weak strongly reduced ufr 2 r x is a weak reduced ufr 3 r is a finite direct product of ufds proof 3 2 r x is a finite direct product of ufds and it is easily checked that a finite direct product of ufds is a reduced ufr 2 1 clear 1 3 assume that r x is a weak strongly reduced ufr then for a regular nonunit f r x any two atomic factorizations of f are isomorphic that is r x is factorial by theorem 5 4 r is a finite direct product of ufds theorem 5 7 for a commutative ring r the following conditions are equivalent 1 r x is a weak strongly reduced ufr 2 r x is a weak reduced ufr 3 r is either a ufd or r d 1 dn where di is a ufd with u di 1 proof 3 2 here either r x is a ufd or r x d 1 x dn x is a ufd with u d xi 1 in either case it is easily checked that r x is a reduced ufr 2 1 clear 1 3 suppose that r x is a weak strongly reduced ufr then as in 1 2 of theorem 5 6 r x is factorial and hence r d 1 dn where di is a ufd suppose that n 1 we need each u di x u di 1 now suppose that some u di 1 let u u di 1 then 0 1 1 0 1 1 u 1 0 1 1 u 1 1 1 where u and u 1 appear in the ith coordinate are two strongly reduced atomic factorizations of 0 1 1 a contradiction it is interesting to note that while theorems 3 3 and 3 4 of 17 require the factorization of 0 to be unique theorems 5 6 and 5 7 do not our last result of this section summarizes the various unique factorization char acterizations for r x and extends them to several variables theorem 5 8 let r be a commutative ring and x an indeterminate over r 1 the following are equivalent a r is a ufd b r x is a ufr resp is atomic and any two factorizations of nonzero nonunits into irreducibles are homomorphic c for any set x 1 of indeterminates overr r x is a ufr resp is atomic and any two factorizations of nonzero

c holds c d clear d a let 0 and 0 so r x x 0 r x is a ufr resp is atomic and any two factorizations of nonzero nonunits into irreducibles are homomorphic by a b r x is a ufd hence r is a ufd 2 a b theorems 5 4 and 5 6 the other implications follow as in 1 mutatis mutandis 3 a b theorem 5 7 the other implications follow as in 2 mutatis mutandis and the observation that for any set x of indeterminates over an integral domain d u d u d x 6 polynomial rings over unique factorization rings a polynomial ring over a ufd is again a ufd this is not the case for the other types of unique factorization rings that we have defined suppose that r is a total quotient ring then r is certainly factorial but r x need not even be atomic indeed x need not be a finite product of atoms e g r an infinite direct product of fields if r is an spir or a quasilocal ring r m with m 2 0 then r is factorial a ufr a weak ufr and a strongly reduced ufr but r x has none of those properties except for the trivial case where r is a field and if r is an spir then r is a fletcher ufr but r x is not a fletcher ufr unless r is a field this raises the question of what factorization properties r x has in the case where r is an spir or a quasilocal ring r m with m 2 0 recall the following definitions from 11 let r be a commutative ring then r is a half factorial ring hfr if r is atomic and for any nonzero nonunit a r any two atomic factorizations of a have the same length the ring r is a bounded factorization ring bfr if 1 r is atomic and 2 for each nonzero nonunit a r there is a bound on the length of atomic factorizations of a or equivalently 3 for each nonzero nonunit a r there is a natural number n a so that for any factorization of a into nonunits a a 1 an n n a finally r is called a finite factorization ring ffr if every nonzero nonunit of r has only a finite number of 20 d d anderson and ranthony a c edmonds factorizations up to order and associates a weak finite factorization ring wffr if every nonzero nonunit of r has only a finite number of nonassociate divisors and an atomic idf ring if r is atomic and each nonzero element of r has at most a finite number of nonassociate irreducible divisors an hfr ffr and a bfr are pre simplifiable note that the following are equivalent 1 r is an ffr 2 r is a bfr and wffr 3 r is pre simplifable and a wffr 4 r is a bfr and an atomic idf ring and 5 r is pre simplifiable and an atomic idf ring 11 proposition 6 6 we have the following diagram where none of the implications can be reversed hfr p pp pp p pp p pp pp p pp p pp p pp ufr 2 p pp pp pp pp pp p pp pp pp pp pp pp bfr 3 accp 3 atomic ffr 2 wffr atomic idf ring in section 3 we remarked that coykendall and trentham 18 gave an example of a zero dimensional quasilocal ring s with s x atomic or equivalently very strongly atomic but s is not atomic it is easily checked that if r x satisfies any of the conditions in the diagram other than being atomic or an atomic idf ring then so does r certainly if r x is an idf ring so is r now if r x is an atomic idf ring then either r is an integral domain and hence a ffd or r is a finite local ring 12 theorem 1 7 in either case r is pre simplifiable and hence so is r x so for a polynomial ring r x the notions of ffr wffr and atomic idf ring coincide hence if r x is an atomic idf ring so is r suppose that r m is a quasilocal ring with mn 0 for some n 1 then r is a bfr we next note that r x is a bfr theorem 6 1 suppose that r m is a quasilocal ring with mn 0 for some n 1 let x be an indeterminate over r then r x is a bfr hence if r is a ufr r x is a bfr and thus is atomic proof in 7 theorem 12 it was shown that if r is a bfr with the zero ideal pri mary and m 1 nil r m 0 then r x is a bfr thus if r m is a quasilocal ring with mn 0 for some n 1 r x is a bfr we next show for r a ufr r x is an hfr only in the trivial case where r is a ufd theorem 6 2 let r be a commutative ring and x an indeterminate over r suppose that r has a nonzero nilpotent atom then r x is a not an hfr hence unique factorization in polynomial rings with zero divisors 21 if r is a zero dimensional quasilocal ring that is not a field e g a ufr that is not a ufd r x is not an hfr proof we may suppose that r is indecomposable for otherwise r x is not an hfr let m be a natural number let b nil r we first note that xm b is a product of atoms and any atomic factorization of xm b has at most m factors for let xm b f 1 fn where fi r x is a nonunit pass to r r nil r so r is an indecomposable reduced ring then xm xm b f 1 f n since fi is a nonunit so is f i by corollary 4 6 n m thus x m b is a product of atoms and any atomic factorization of xm b has at most m factors suppose further that b is an atom then xm b is actually irreducible for let xm b f 1 fn where each fi r x is irreducible since b is an atom exactly one fi has fi 0 a nonunit suppose that fj 0 is a unit then fj 0 is a unit and f j is a factor of x m so again by corollary 4 6 f j is a unit and so fj is a unit so x m b is an atom choose n 1 with b 2 n 1 0 then x 2 n x 2 n b 2 n 1 x 2 n 1 b 2 n 2 x 2 n 2 b 2 n 3 x 4 b 2 x 2 b x 2 b since r is indecomposable x is an atom hence x 2 n is a product of 2 n atoms factoring x 2 n 1 b 2 n 2 x 4 b 2 into atoms and noting that x 2 b and x 2 b are both atoms we see that x 2 n x 2 n b 2 n 1 has an atomic factorization with at most 2 n 1 2 n 2 4 2 2 n atoms thus r x is not a hfr for other examples of non unique factorization in the spir zpn for n 2 see 21 we end by noting that for r a ufr that is not an integral domain or equiva lently a ufd r x is an ffr if and only if r is finite theorem 6 3 let r be a commutative ring andx an indeterminate over r then r x is an ffr if and only if either 1 r is an ffd or 2 r m is a finite local ring satisfying a for x 1 xk m m 2 x 1 xk m k mk 1 for 1 k n 1 or equivalently x m i m i 1 and y m j m j 1 xy m i j m i j 1 for i j n where mn 0 but mn 1 6 0 and b am m 2 for a m m 2 thus if r is a ufr r x is an ffr if and only if r is a ufd or r is finite proof first suppose that r m is a finite local ring wheremn 0 butmn 1 6 0 then 3 theorem 17 r x is an ffr if and only if r satisfies a if r 1 rk are atoms of r where k n then r 1 rk m k mk 1 and b every element of m m 2 divides all elements of m 2 clearly b and b are equivalent also b implies that r r is an atom if and only if r m m 2 so a and a are equivalent also note that x mk mk 1 for 1 k n 1 if and only if x is a product of k atoms so a is also equivalent to the condition x m i m i 1 and y m j m j 1 where i j n xy m i j m i j 1 suppose that r x is an ffr by 12 theorem 1 7 r is either an integral domain and hence a ffd or r is a finite local ring but if r is a finite local ring then r satisfies a and b by the remarks of the previous paragraph if r is an ffd then it is well known that r x is an ffd 4 proposition 5 3 if r is a finite local ring satisfying a and b r x is an ffr by the remarks of the first paragraph of the proof 22 d d anderson and ranthony a c edmonds the last statement is now immediate since a quasilocal ring r m with m 2 0 or r an spir clearly satisfies a and b this is remarked in the paragraph after 3 theorem 17 note that if r is one of the types of unique factorization rings that are not indecomposable then r and r x have nontrivial idempotents and hence
