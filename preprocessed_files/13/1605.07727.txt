maximal degrees of the syzygies of facet ideals simplicial forests for such an ideal i if the i th betti number is nonzero and i a b we show that there are monomials in the lcm lattice of i that are complements in part of the lattice each supporting a nonvanishing a th and b th betti numbers the subadditivity formula follows from this observation 1 introduction let k x 1 xn where k is a field and let i be a graded ideal of s and suppose s i has minimal graded free resolution 0 j ns j p j j ns j p 1 j j ns j 1 j s where the graded betti numbers i j s i denote the rank of the degree j component s j ap pearing in the ith homological degree in this sequence for an integer i define ta i max j a j s i 6 0 we say that the degrees of the betti numbers of i satisfy the subadditivity property if ta b i 6 ta i tb i for all a b 0 with a b 6 p where p is the projective dimension of s i it is known that in general the subadditivity property does not hold avramov conca iyen gar aci but under restrictive conditions many cases have been known to hold these include some algebras of krull dimension at most 1 eisenbud huneke and ulrich ehu when a 1 ferna ndez ramos and gimenez fg if i is

case a 1 2 3 for a monomial ideal generated in degree 2 abedelfatah and nevo an other wise the question is wide open for the class of monomial ideals we approach this problem using lattice complements which appear in the topology of lattices two elements of a lattice are complements if their join and their meet are 1 and 0 respectively in the case of two monomials in the lcm lattice of a monomial ideal they are complements if their gcd is not in the ideal and their lcm is the lcm of all the generators our motivation for using complements is the fact that if the top degree betti number of a mono mial ideal i is nonzero then every monomial in the lcm lattice of i has a complement this follows from the interpretation of betti numbers of monomial ideals in terms of homology of open intervals in lattices by gasharov peeva and welker gpw p and baclawski s b work that relates the homology of lattices to the existence of complements by polarization to find betti numbers of monomial ideals it is enough to consider betti num bers of square free monomial ideals moreover in this case inquiries about a specific graded betti number reduces to that of top degree betti numbers see below for more on this so we ask the following question question 1 1 if i is a square free monomial involving n variables and i n s i 6 0 a b 0 and i a b are there complements m and m in the lcm lattice of i with nonzero multigraded betti numbers a m s i and b m s i if the answer is positive then the subadditivity conjecture is true for all monomial ideals since deg m deg m n in this paper we give a positive answer to this question in the case where i is the facet ideal of a simplicial forest in this case we take advantage of the a recursive formula relating betti numbers in each homological degree to lower ones hv f 2 what we really use is the inductive existence of a facet with a free vertex which acts as a splitting facet in the eliahou kervaire sense we hope however that some of these methods can be used to study the general version of the subadditivity property for monomial ideals a further study to see if question 1 1 holds in general would be extremely useful for this purpose

maximal elements under inclusion are called facets and the dimension of a face f of is defined as f 1 the faces of dimensions 0 and 1 are called vertices and edges respectively and dim 1 the dimension of is the maximal dimension of its facets we denote the set of vertices of by v a subcollection of is a simplicial complex whose facets are also facets of in other words a simplicial complex generated by a subset of the set of facets of if u v then the subcollection u consisting of all facets of contained in u is an induced subsollection of 2 we denote the set of facets of by facets if facets f 1 fq we write f 1 fq the simplicial complex obtained by removing the facet fi from is fi f 1 f i fq if f is a facet of then f v f i e all vertices of that are not in f a facet f of simplicial complex is called a leaf if either f is the only facet of or for some facet g f we have f f g equivalently we can say a facet f is a leaf of if f f is a face of f it follows immediately from the definition above that a leaf f must contain at least one vertex that belongs to no other facet of but f we call such a vertex a free vertex we call a simplicial forest if every nonempty subcollection of has a leaf a connected simplicial forest is called a simplicial tree let s k x 1 xn and i a square free monomial ideal in s for a subset u x 1 xn we denote by mu the square free monomial with support u that is mu xi uxi the facet complex of i denoted is the simplicial complex f i u mu is a generator of i conversely given a simplicial complex on vertices from the set x 1 xn we can define the facet ideal of as f mu u is a facet of which is an ideal of s one of the properties of simplicial trees that we will be using in this article is the following lemma 2 1 localization of a forest is a forest f 1 suppose is a simplicial forest with facet ideal i in the polynomial ring s then for any prime ideal p of s ip is the facet ideal of a simplicial forest which we denote by p for a simplicial complex with i f s by i j we mean i j s i the localiza tion property has a substantial effect on the calculation of betti numbers of forests if i is a square free monomial ideal in the polynomial ring s k x 1 xn and with facet complex then every graded betti number i j s i is calculated by taking the sum of all multi graded betti numbers i m s i where m is a square free monomial in s of degree j see for example p such a monomial m is in fact mu for some u x 1 xn and using for example the taylor complex t p one can see that i mu i j u i u u where u is the induced subcollection of on u and j u the taylor resolution also shows that if i mu 6 0 then u must have exactly u vertices these observations reduce the calcu lation of i j to the calculation of the top degree betti numbers of certain subcollections see remark 2 3 and lemma 3 1 of ef 1 3 when i is the facet ideal of a simplicial tree much more about i j is known see for example ef 1 ef 2 in particular a recursive formula for the calculation of the betti numbers of trees in f 2 which is deduced from a splitting formula due to ha and van tuyl theorem 5 5 of hv can be used effectively in this case if is a connected simplicial complex with facet ideal i and f is facet of with a free vertex for example a leaf of a tree then ha and van tuyl s theorem 5 5 gives f 2 for i j 0 i j i j f i 1 j f f f 1 in what follows we will use the localized complex f f extensively it is worth observing that if f 1 fq then has as facets the minimal elements under inclusion of f 1 f fq f which correspond to the generators of the ideal i f this leads to the following observation which was used in the case of trees in ef 2 proposition 2 2 let be a simplicial complex on n vertices f a facet of with a free vertex and suppose f f then for every i we have i n i 1 n f proof if is connected then since f has a free vertex f has strictly less than n vertices so in equation 1 i n f 0 which results in i n i 1 n f suppose has connected components 1 r each with n 1 nr vertices respectively assume without loss of generality f is a facet of 1 the connected components of are of the form a a f f where if a 1 one can see immediately that a a as f and a will have no vertices in common so we can write see lemma 3 2 of ef 1 i n u 1 ur i u 1 n 1 1 ur nr r u 1 ur i u 1 1 n 1 f 1 f f u 2 n 2 2 ur nr r u 1 ur i u 1 1 n 1 f 1 u 2 n 2 2 ur nr r i 1 n f 4 3 betti numbers of complements let i be a square free monomial ideal in s k x 1 xn we denote the lcm lattice of i by lcm i the atoms of this lattice are the generators of i and the other members are lcm s of the generators of i ordered by divisibility the top element 1 is the lcm of all generators of i and the bottom element 0 is 1 see p for more on lcm lattices and their properties the following definition is an adaptation of the usual concept of lattice complements to the lcm lattice definition 3 1 let i be a square free monomial ideal two monomials m and m in lcm i 0 1 are called complements if lcm m m 1 and gcd m m i this definition leads directly to the following statement lemma 3 2 let be a simplicial complex on n vertices and with facet ideal i s and let u and v be two proper subsets of x 1 xn with mu mv lcm i 0 1 then the following are equivalent 1 mu and mv are complements in lcm i 2 a u v x 1 xn and b the two induced subcollections u and v have no facet in common based on the observation above we call two proper induced subcollections u and v of complements in if the two conditions in lemma 3 2 2 hold lemma 3 3 let be a simplicial complex f a facet of with a free vertex f f and u f 1 u f u f f 2 if u has u vertices then f u has u f u f vertices proof 1 we show each inclusion let g f be a facet of u then g is a facet of such that g f u which implies that g u f hence g is a facet of f u if h is another facet of f u with h f g f then as h f u we will have h f u which contradicts the fact that g f is a facet of u suppose g f is a facet of f u f f then g f u and hence g f u if g f u then there is another facet h of with h f g f u but then then h f f u f f which is a contradiction 5 2 suppose u g 1 f gt f where by the previous part we can pick g 1 gt to be facets of f u then g 1 gt f u and also f f u since u f we have already accounted for f u vertices in f u however this is the maximum number of vertices that f u could have so our claim is proved theorem 3 4 let be a simplicial forest with n vertices and more than one facet and suppose i n 6 0 then for every facet g of g has a complement u in with i 1 u u 6 0 proof we use induction on n the smallest case is n 2 and a complex consisting of two iso lated vertices f x 1 and g x 2 and we have 2 2 6 0 and 1 1 f 1 1 g 6 0 since f and g are complements this settles the statement in the case n 2 since every forest has at least two leaves f 1 we can choose f to be a leaf of with f 6 g suppose f f by proposition 2 2 i n 6 0 results in i 1 n f 6 0 which in particular implies that has n f vertices by lemma 2 1 is a forest so it satisfies the induction hypothesis now has a facet h f such that h f g f with h g possible by the induction hypothesis h f has a complement v in such that i 2 v v 6 0 which in particular implies that v has v vertices by lemma 3 3 f v has f v vertices and v f v f f proposition 2 2 now implies that i 1 f v f v 6 0 we set u f v and show that u and g are complements in since v and h f are complements in v h f v v f and add to this the fact that h f g f to conclude u g v f g v if u and g have a facet in common then g u which implies that g u v f on the other hand h f g f v h f v which contradicts v and h f being complements in so u and g are complements in and we are done theorem 3 5 let be a simplicial forest with more than one facet and facet ideal i s suppose i n 6 0 and i a b for some positive integers a and b then there are complements u and w in with a u u 6 0 and b w w 6 0 proof without loss of generality assume has n vertices we prove the statement by induction on n the base case is n 2 where is two isolated vertices in this case i 2 1 1 and the claim follows from theorem 3 4 6 we consider the general case from theorem 3 4 the statement is true if a 1 or b 1 so we may assume a b 1 let f be a leaf of and let f f by proposition 2 2 i 1 n f 6 0 and in particular v n f by the induction hypothesis since i 1 a 1 b there are complements u and v in such that a 1 u u 6 0 and b v v 6 0 let u u f and v v f by lemma 3 3 we have that v v f f and u u f f and u and v have u and v vertices respectively proposition 2 2 implies that a u u 6 0 and b 1 v v 6 0 now we focus on v which contains the facet f by theorem 3 4 f has a complement w in v with b w w 6 0 we show that w and u are complements in from the fact that w and f are complements in v we see f 6 w and w f v v f but v f so w v we write w v w where w f it is clear that w u v if g is a facet of and g u w u f v w u v f then g f u v now there is a facet h of such that h f g f and h f is a facet of but then since h f u v we have that h f is a facet of both u and v which contradicts the fact that these two are complements in so w and u have no facets in common and are therefore complements in remark 3 6 it must be noted that under the assumptions of theorem 3 5 not every mu lcm i with a u u 6 0 has a complement mv with b v v 6 0 for example consider the ideal i ab bc cd de the only complement of mu bcd is mv abde we have 3 5 s i 6 0 and 2 3 s bc cd 6 0 but 1 4 s ab de 0 theorem 3 7 subadditivity of betti numbers of forests let be a simplicial forest with facet ideal i and suppose i is at most the projective dimension of s i and i a b where a b 0 then ta i tb i ta b i 7 proof assume without loss of generality that has n vertices and i n 6 0 if has only one facet there is nothing to prove as i 1 if has more than one facet by theorem 3 5 there are complements u and v in with a u u 6 0 and b v v 6 0 it follows that ta i tb i u v n ta b i references aci l avramov a conca and s iyengar
