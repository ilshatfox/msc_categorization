relativize quasi pru fer domains and to take also into account some contexts in recent papers where such extensions appear in a hidden form an extension is quasi pru fer if and only if it is an inc pair the class of these extensions has nice stability properties we also define almost pru fer extensions that are quasi pru fer the converse being not true quasi pru fer extensions are closely linked to finiteness properties of fibers applications are given for fmc extensions because they are quasi pru fer 1 introduction and notation we consider the category of commutative and unital rings an epi morphism is an epimorphism of this category let r s be a ring extension the set of all r subalgebras of s is denoted by r s the extension r s is said to have fip for the finitely many intermedi ate algebras property if r s is finite a chain of r subalgebras of s is a set of elements of r s that are pairwise comparable with respect to inclusion we say that the extension r s has fcp for the finite chain property if each chain in r s is finite dobbs and the authors characterized fcp and fip extensions 10 clearly an extension that satisfies fip must also satisfy fcp an extension r s is called fmc if there is a finite maximal chain of extensions from r to s we begin by explaining our motivations and aims the reader who is not familiar with the notions used will find some scholia in the sequel as well as necessary definitions that exist in the literature knebusch and zang introduced pru fer extensions in their book 26 actually these extensions are nothing but normal pairs that are intensively studied in the literature we do not intend to give an extensive list of recent papers written by ayache ben nasr dobbs jaballah jarboui and some others we are indebted to these authors because their pa pers are a rich source of suggestions we observed that some of them 2010 mathematics subject classification primary 13 b 22 secondary key words and phrases flat epimorphism fip fcp extension minimal exten sion integral extension morita pru fer hull support of a module 1 http arxiv org abs 1610 10023 v 1 2 g picavet and m picavet are dealing with fcp fip fmc extensions followed by a pru fer extension perhaps under a hidden form these extensions reminded us quasi pru fer domains see 18 therefore we introduced in 38 quasi pru fer extensions r s as extensions that can be factored r r s where the first extension is integral and the second is pru fer note that fmc extensions are quasi pru fer we give a systematic study of quasi pru fer extensions in section 2 and section 3 the class of quasi pru fer extensions has a nice behavior with respect to the classical operations of commutative algebra an im portant result is that quasi pru fer extensions coincide with inc pairs another one is that this class is stable under forming subextensions and composition a striking result is the stability of the class of quasi pru fer extensions by absolutely flat base change like localizations and henselizations any ring extension r s admits a quasi pru fer clo sure contained in s examples are provided by laskerian pairs open pairs and the pseudo pru fer pairs of dobbs shapiro 15 section 4 deals with almost pru fer extensions a special kind of quasi pru fer extensions they are of the form r t s where the first extension is pru fer and the second is integral any ring extension admits an almost pru fer closure contained in s the class of almost pru fer extensions seems to have less properties than the class of quasi pru fer extensions but has the advantage of the commutation of pru fer closures with localizations at prime ideals we examine the transfer of the quasi almost pru fer properties to subextensions section 5 study the transfer of the quasi almost pru fer properties to nagata extensions in section 6 we complete and generalize the results of ayache dobbs in 5 with respect to the finiteness of fibers these authors have evi dently considered particular cases of quasi pru fer extensions a main result is that if r s is quasi pru fer with finite fibers then so is r t for t r s in particular we recover a result of 5 about fmc extensions now section 7 gives calculations of r s with respect to its pru fer closure quasi pru fer almost pru fer closure in case r s has fcp 1 1 recalls about some results and definitions the reader is warned that we will mostly use the definition of pru fer extensions by flat epimorphic subextensions investigated in 26 the results needed may be found in scholium a for flat epimorphic extensions and some results of 26 are summarized in scholium b their powers give quick proofs of results that are generalizations of results of the literature quasi pru fer extensions 3 as long as fcp or fmc extensions are concerned we use minimal ring extensions a concept introduced by ferrand olivier 17 an extension r s is called minimal if r s r s it is known that a minimal extension is either module finite or a flat epimorphism 17 and these conditions are mutually exclusive there are three types of integral minimal module finite extensions ramified decomposed or inert 36 theorem 3 3 a minimal extension r s admits a crucial ideal c r s m which is maximal in r and such that rp sp for each p 6 m p spec r moreover c r s r s when r s is an integral minimal extension the key connection between the above ideas is that if r s has fcp or fmc then any maximal necessarily finite chain of r subalgebras of s r r 0 r 1 rn 1 rn s with length n results from juxtaposing n minimal extensions ri ri 1 0 i n 1 following 24 we define the length r s of r s as the supremum of the lengths of chains in r s in particular if r s r for some integer r there exists a maximal chain in r s with length r as usual spec r max r min r u r tot r are respectively the set of prime ideals maximal ideals minimal prime ideals units total ring of fractions of a ring r and p rp prp is the residual field of r at p spec r if r s is an extension then r s is its conductor and if p spec r then sp is the localization sr p we denote the integral closure of r in s by r s or r a local ring is here what is called elsewhere a quasi local ring the support of an r module e is suppr e p spec r ep 6 0 and msuppr e suppr e max r finally denotes proper inclusion and x the cardinality of a set x scholium a we give some recalls about flat epimorphisms see 27 chapitre iv except 2 which is 31 proposition 2 1 r s is a flat epimorphism for all p spec r either rp sp is an isomorphism or s ps rp sp is a flat epimorphism for all p spec r 2 s a flat epimorphism with a zero dimensional domain is sur jective 3 if f a b and g b c are ring morphisms such that g f is injective and f is a flat epimorphism then g is injective 4 let r t s be a tower of extensions such that r s is a flat epimorphism then t s is a flat epimorphism but r t does not need a pru fer extension remedies to this defect 4 g picavet and m picavet 5 l a faithfully flat epimorphism is an isomorphism hence r s if r s is an integral flat epimorphism 6 if f r s is a flat epimorphism and j an ideal of s then j f 1 j s 7 if f r s is an epimorphism then f is spectrally injective and its residual extensions are isomorphisms 8 flat epimorphisms remain flat epimorphisms under base change in particular after a localization with respect to a multiplica tively closed subset 9 flat epimorphisms are descended by faithfully flat morphisms 1 2 recalls and results on pru fer extensions we recall some definitions and properties of ring extensions r s and rings r there are a lot of characterizations of pru fer extensions we keep only those that are useful in this paper we give the two definitions that are dual and emphasize some characterizations in the local case scholium b 1 26 r s is called pru fer if r t is a flat epimorphism for each t r s 2 r s is called a normal pair if t s is integrally closed for each t r s 3 r s is pru fer if and only if it is a normal pair 26 theorem 5 2 4 4 r is called pru fer if its finitely generated regular ideals are invertible or equivalently r tot r is pru fer 20 theorem 13 5 9 hence pru fer extensions are a relativization of pru fer rings clearly a minimal extension is a flat epimorphism if and only if it is pru fer we will then use for such extensions the terminology pru fer minimal extensions the reader may find some properties of pru fer minimal extensions in 36 proposition 3 2 lemma 3 4 and proposition 3 5 as serted by l dechene in her dissertation but where in addition r must be supposed local the reason why is that this word has surprisingly disappeared during the printing process of 36 we will need the two next results some of them do not explicitely appear in 26 but deserve to be emphasized we refer to 26 definition 1 p 22 for a definition of manis extensions proposition 1 1 let r s be a ring extension 1 r s is pru fer if and only if rp sp is pru fer for each p spec r respectively p supp s r quasi pru fer extensions 5 2 r s is pru fer if and only if rm sm is manis for each m max r proof 1 the class of pru fer extensions is stable under localization 26 proposition 5 1 ii p 46 47 to get the converse use scholium a 1 2 follows from 26 proposition 2 10 p 28 definition 1 p 46 proposition 1 2 let r s be a ring extension where r is local 1 r s is manis if and only if s r u s and x s r x 1 r in that case r s is integrally closed 2 r s is manis if and only if r s is pru fer 3 r s is pru fer if and only if there exists p spec r such that s rp p sp and r p is a valuation domain under these conditions s p is the quotient field of r p proof 1 is 26 theorem 2 5 p 24 2 is 26 scholium 10 4 p 147 then 3 is 10 theorem 6 8 next result shows that pru fer fcp extensions can be described in a special manner proposition 1 3 let r s be a ring extension 1 if r s has fcp then r s is integrally closed r s is pru fer r s is a composite of pru fer minimal extensions 2 if r s is integrally closed then r s has fcp r s is pru fer and supp s r is finite proof 1 assume that r s has fcp if r s is integrally closed then r s is composed of pru fer minimal extensions by 10 lemma 3 10 conversely if r s is composed of pru fer minimal extensions r s is integrally closed since so is each pru fer minimal extension a pru fer extension is obviously integrally closed and an fcp integrally closed extension is pru fer by 10 theorem 6 3 2 the logical equivalence is 10 theorem 6 3 definition 1 4 26 a ring extension r s has 1 a greatest flat epimorphic subextension r r s called the morita hull of r in s 2 a greatest pru fer subextension r r s called the pru fer hull of r in s we set r r s and r r s if no confusion can occur r s is called pru fer closed if r r note that r s is denoted by p r s in 26 and r s is the weakly surjective hull m r s of 26 our terminology is justified because 6 g picavet and m picavet morita s work is earlier 30 corollary 3 4 the morita hull can be computed by using a transfinite induction 30 let s be the set of all s s such that there is some ideal i of r such that is s and is r then r s is a subextension of r s we set s 1 s and si 1 si si by 30 p 36 if r s is an fcp extension then r sn for some integer n at this stage it is interesting to point out a result showing again that integral closedness and pru fer extensions are closely related proposition 1 5 olivier 33 corollary p 56 an extension r s is integrally closed if and only if there is a pullback square r s y y v k where v is a semi hereditary ring and k its total quotient ring in that case v k is a pru fer extension since v is a pru fer ring whose localizations at prime ideals are valuation domains and k is an absolutely flat ring as there exist integrally closed extensions that are not pru fer we see in passing that the pullback construction may not descend pru fer extensions the above result has a companion for minimal extensions that are pru fer 21 proposition 3 2 proposition 1 6 let r s be an extension and t r s then r t r t therefore for t u r s with t u then r t r u proof obvious since the pru fer hull r t is the greatest pru fer exten sion r v contained in t we will show later that in some cases t u if r s has fcp 2 quasi pru fer extensions we introduced the following definition in 38 p 10 definition 2 1 an extension of rings r s is called quasi pru fer if one of the following equivalent statements holds 1 r s is a pru fer extension 2 r s can be factored r t s where r t is integral and t s is pru fer in that case r t to see that 2 1 observe that if 2 holds then t r is integral and a flat injective epimorphism so thatr t by l scholium a 5 quasi pru fer extensions 7 we observe that quasi pru fer extensions are akin to quasi finite ex tensions if we refer to zariski main theorem this will be explored in section 6 see for example theorem 6 2 hence integral or pru fer extensions are quasi pru fer an extension is clearly pru fer if and only if it is quasi pru fer and integrally closed quasi pru fer extensions allow us to avoid fcp hypotheses we give some other definitions involved in ring extensions r s the fiber at p spec r of r s is fibr s p q spec s q r p the subspace fibr s p of spec s is homeomorphic to the spectrum of the fiber ring fr s p p r s at p the homeomorphism is given by the spectral map of s p r s and p p r s is the fiber morphism at p definition 2 2 a ring extension r s is called 1 incomparable if for each pair q q of prime ideals of s then q r q r q q or equivalently p r t is a zero dimensional ring for each t r s and p spec r such that p r t 6 0 2 an inc pair if r t is incomparable for each t r s 3 residually algebraic if r q r s q is algebraic for each q spec s 4 a residually algebraic pair if the extension r t is residually algebraic for each t r s the following characterization was announced in 38 we were un aware that this result is also proved in 7 corollary 1 when we present it in arxiv however our proof is largely shorter because we use the powerful results of 26 theorem 2 3 an extension r s is quasi pru fer if and only if r s is an inc pair and if and only if r s is a residually algebraic pair proof suppose that r s is quasi pru fer and let t r s we set u rt then r u is a flat epimorphism by definition of a pru fer extension and hence is incomparable as is r r it follows that r u is incomparable since t u is integral it has going up it follows that r t is incomparable conversely if r s is an inc pair then so is r s since r s is integrally closed r s is pru fer 26 theorem 5 2 9 p 48 the second equivalence is 14 proposition 2 1 or 18 theorem 6 5 6 corollary 2 4 an extension r s is quasi pru fer if and only if r t is pru fer for each t r s 8 g picavet and m picavet it follows that most of the properties described in 6 for integrally closed inc pairs of domains are valid for arbitrary ring extensions moreover a result of dobbs is easily gotten an inc pair r s is an integral extension if and only if r s is spectrally surjective 14 theorem 2 2 this follows from scholium a property l example 2 5 quasi pru fer domains r with quotient fields k can be characterized by r k is quasi pru fer the reader may consult 9 theorem 1 1 or 18 in view of 2 theorem 2 7 r is a quasi pru fer domain if and only if spec r x spec r is bijective we give here another example of quasi pru fer extension an exten sion r s is called a going down pair if each of its subextensions has the going down property for such a pair r t has incomparability for each t r s at each non maximal prime ideal of r 3 lemma 5 8 ii now let m be a maximal ideal of r whose fiber is not void in t then r t is a going down pair and so is r m t mt because mt r m by 3 corollary 5 6 the dimension of t mt is 1 therefore if r s is a going down pair then r s is quasi pru fer if and only if dim t mt 6 1 for each t r s and m max r also open ring pairs r s are quasi pru fer by 8 proposition 2 13 an i pair is an extension r s such that spec t spec r is injective for each t r s or equivalently if and only if r s is quasi pru fer and r r is spectrally injective 38 proposition 5 8 these extensions appear frequently in the integral domains context another examples are given by some extensions r s such that spec s spec r as sets as we will see later 3 properties of quasi pru fer extensions we now develop the machinery of quasi pru fer extensions proposition 3 1 an extension r s is quasi pru fer if and only if rp sp is quasi pru fer for any p spec r p msupp s r proof the proof is easy if we use the inc pair property definition of quasi pru fer extension see also 6 proposition 2 4 proposition 3 2 let r s be a quasi pru fer extension and s s an integral ring morphism then r s is quasi pru fer and s s r where r is the integral closure of r in s proof it is enough to apply 26 theorem 5 9 to the pru fer extension r s and to use definition 2 1 this result applies with s s r r where r r is an integral morphism therefore integrality ascends the quasi pru fer property quasi pru fer extensions 9 we know that a composite of pru fer extensions is pru fer 26 theo rem 5 6 p 51 the following corollary 3 3 contains 7 theorem 3 corollary 3 3 let r t s be a tower of extensions then r s is quasi pru fer if and only if r t and t s are quasi pru fer it follows that r t is quasi pru fer if and only if r rt is quasi pru fer proof consider a tower t of extensions r r s r r s a composite of two quasi pru fer extensions by using proposition 3 2 we see that r s r r is quasi pru fer then t is obtained by writing on the left an integral extension and on the right a pru fer extension therefore t is quasi pru fer we prove the converse if r t s is a tower of extensions then r t and t s are inc pairs whenever r s is an inc pair the converse is then a consequence of theorem 2 3 the last statement is 7 corollary 4 using the above corollary we can exhibit new examples of quasi pru fer extensions we recall that a ring r is called laskerian if each of its ideals is a finite intersection of primary ideals and a ring extension r s a laskerian pair if each t r s is a laskerian ring then 42 proposition 2 1 shows that if r is an integral domain with quotient field f 6 r and f k is a field extension then r k is a laskerian pair if and only if k is algebraic over r and r in k is a laskerian pru fer domain it follows easily that r k is quasi pru fer next result generalizes 25 proposition 1 corollary 3 4 an fmc extension r s is quasi pru fer proof because r s is a composite of finitely many minimal exten sions by corollary 3 3 it is enough to observe that a minimal extension is either pru fer or integral corollary 3 5 let r s be a quasi pru fer extension and a tower r t s where r t is integrally closed then r t is pru fer proof observe that r t is quasi pru fer and then that r r t next result deals with the dobbs shapiro pseudo pru fer extensions of integral domains 15 that they called pseudo normal pairs suppose thatr is local we call here pseudo pru fer an extension r s such that there exists t r s with spec r spec t and t s is pru fer 15 corollary 2 5 if r is arbitrary the extension r s is called pseudo pru fer if rm sm is pseudo pru fer for each m max r in view of the corollary 3 3 it is enough to characterize quasi pru fer extensions of the type r t with spec r spec t 10 g picavet and m picavet corollary 3 6 let r t be an extension with spec r spec t and r m local then r t is quasi pru fer if and only if spec r spec u for each u r t and if and only if r m t m is an algebraic field extension in such a case r t is pru fer closed proof it follows from 1 thatm max t part of the proof is gotten by observing that r u is an inc extension if spec r spec u another one is proved in 1 corollary 3 26 now r r is a spectrally surjective flat epimorphism and then by scholium a r r let r s be an extension and i an ideal shared with r and s it is easy to show that r s is quasi pru fer if and only if r i s i is quasi pru fer by using 26 proposition 5 8 in the pru fer case we are able to give a more general statement lemma 3 7 let r s be a quasi pru fer extension and j an ideal of s with i j r then r i s j is a quasi pru fer extension if r s is pru fer and n is a maximal ideal of s then r n r is a valuation domain with quotient field s n proof assume first that r s is pru fer we have j is by scholium a 6 because r s is a flat epimorpism therefore any d r i s j is of the form c j where c r s we can write c is c i is c c is as r c is a flat epimorphism c is ic it then follows that d c r i and we get easily that r i s j is pru fer since r i d is a flat epimorphism the quasi pru fer case is an easy consequence with this lemma we generalize and complete 23 proposition 1 1 proposition 3 8 let r s be an extension of rings the following statements are equivalent 1 r s is quasi pru fer 2 r q r s q is quasi pru fer for each q spec s 3 x s s x r x 6 m x for each s s and m max r 4 for each t r s the fiber morphisms of r t are integral proof 1 2 is entailed by lemma 3 7 assume that 2 holds and let m max r that contains a minimal prime ideal p lain over by a minimal prime ideal q of s then 2 3 follows from 23 propo sition 1 1 1 applied to r q r s q if 3 holds argue as in the paragraph before 23 proposition 1 1 to get that r s is a p extension whence an inc extension by 14 proposition 2 1 because integral extensions have incomparability we see that 4 1 corol lary 3 3 shows that the reverse implication holds if any quasi pru fer quasi pru fer extensions 11 extension r s has integral fiber morphisms for p spec r the extension rp prp sp psp is quasi pru fer by lemma 3 7 the ring rp prp is zero dimensional and rp prp sp psp being a flat epimorphism is therefore surjective by scholium a s it follows that the fiber morphism at p is integral remark 3 9 the logical equivalence 1 2 is still valid if we replace quasi pru fer with integral in the above proposition it is enough to show that an extension r s is integral when r p s q is integral for each q spec s and p q r we can suppose that s r s r x i where x is an indeterminate i an ideal of r x and q varies in min s because for an extension a b any element of min a is lain over by some element of min b if is the set of unitary polynomials of r x the assumptions show that any element of spec r x containing i meets as is a multiplicatively closed subset i 6 whence s is integral over r but a similar result does not hold if we replace quasi pru fer with pru fer except if we suppose that r s is integrally closed to see this apply the above proposition to get a quasi pru fer extension r s if each r p s q is pru fer actually this situation already occurs for pru fer rings and their factor domains as lucas s paper 29 shows more precisely 29 proposition 2 7 and the third paragraph of 29 p 336 shows that if r is a ring with tot r absolutely flat then r is a quasi pru fer ring if r p is a pru fer domain for each p spec r now example 29 example 2 4 shows that r is not necessarily pru fer we observe that if r s is quasi pru fer then r m is a quasi pru fer domain for each n max s and m n r in case r s is integral r m is a field to prove this observe that r m s n can be factored r m m s n as we will see r m m is quasi pru fer because r m s n is quasi pru fer the class of pru fer extensions is not stable by flat base change for example let v be a valuation domain with quotient field k then v x k x is not pru fer 26 example 5 12 p 53 thus if we consider an ideal i of r and j is r s pru fer may not imply r i s is pru fer except if is r i this happens for instance for a prime ideal i of r that is lain over by a prime ideal of s proposition 3 10 let r s be a quasi pru fer extension and r t a flat epimorphism then t s rt is quasi pru fer if in addition s and t are both subrings of some ring and r t is an extension then t ts is quasi pru fer 12 g picavet and m picavet proof for the first part it is enough to consider the pru fer case it is well known that the following diagram is a pushout if q spec t is lying over p in r rp sp y y tq t r s q as rp tq is an isomorphism since r t is a flat epimorphism by scholium a it follows that rp sp identifies to tq t r s q the result follows because pru fer extensions localize and globalize in case r t is a flat epimorphic extension the surjective maps t r s ts and r r t rt are isomorphisms because r tr resp s st is injective and r t t r resp s s r t is a flat epimorphism then it is enough to use scholium a the reader may find in 26 corollary 5 11 p 53 that if r a s and r b s are extensions and r a and r b are both pru fer then r ab is pru fer proposition 3 11 let r a and r b be two extensions where a and b are subrings of a ring s if they are both quasi pru fer then r ab is quasi pru fer proof let u and v be the integral closures of r in a and b then r a av is quasi pru fer because a av is integral and corollary 3 3 applies using again corollary 3 3 with r v av we find that v av is quasi pru fer now proposition 3 10 entails that b ab is quasi pru fer because v b is a flat epimorphism finally r ab is quasi pru fer since a composite of quasi pru fer extensions it is known that an arbitrary product of extensions is pru fer if and only if each of its components is pru fer 26 proposition 5 20 p 56 the following result is an easy consequence proposition 3 12 let ri si i 1 n be a finite family of quasi pru fer extensions then r 1 rn s 1 sn is quasi pru fer in particular if r si i 1 n is a finite family of quasi pru fer extensions then r s 1 sn is quasi pru fer in the same way we have the following result deduced from 26 remark 5 14 p 54 proposition 3 13 let r s be an extension of rings and an upward directed family r i of elements of r s such that r r is quasi pru fer for each i then r r i is quasi pru fer quasi pru fer extensions 13 proof it is enough to use 26 proposition 5 13 p 54 where a is the integral closure of r in r a ring morphism r t preserves the integral closure of ring mor phisms r s if t t rs t rr for every ring morphism r s an absolutely flat morphism r t r t and t r t t are both flat preserves integral closure 33 theorem 5 1 flat epimorphisms henselizations and e tale morphisms are absolutely flat another ex amples are morphisms r t that are essentially of finite type and absolutely reduced 37 proposition 5 19 2 such morphisms are flat if r is reduced 28 proposition 3 2 we will prove an ascent result for absolutely flat ring morphisms this will be proved by using base changes for this we need to introduce some concepts a ring a is called an aic ring if each monic polynomial of a x has a zero in a we recalled in 35 p 4662 that any ring a has a faithfully flat integral extension a a where a is an aic ring moreover if a is an aic ring each localization ap at a prime ideal p of a is a strict henselian ring 35 lemma ii 2 theorem 3 14 let r s be a quasi pru fer extension and r t an absolutely flat ring morphism then t t r s is a quasi pru fer extension proof we can suppose that r is an aic ring to see this it is enough to use the base change r r we set t t rr s s rr we first observe that r s is quasi pru fer for the following reason the composite extension r s s is quasi pru fer because the last extension is integral moreover r t is absolutely flat in case t t r s is quasi pru fer so is t t r s because t t t r r is faithfully flat and t t r s is deduced from t r s by the faithfully flat base change t t r s it is then enough to apply proposition 3 17 we thus assume from now on that r is an aic ring letn spec t be lying overm in r then rm tn is absolutely flat 32 proposition f and rm sm is quasi pru fer now observe that t r s n tn rm sm therefore we can suppose that r and t are local and r t is local and injective we deduce from 33 theorem 5 2 that rm tn is an isomorphism therefore the proof is complete in the quasi pru fer case for the pru fer case we need only to observe that absolutely flat morphisms preserve integral closure and a quasi pru fer extension is pru fer if it is integrally closed 14 g picavet and m picavet proposition 3 15 let r s be an extension of rings and r t a base change which preserves integral closure if t t r s has fcp and r s is pru fer then t t r s is pru fer proof the result holds because an fcp extension is pru fer if and only if it is integrally closed we observe that t r r t needs not to be an isomorphism since this property may fail even for a localization r rp where p is a prime ideal of r proposition 3 16 let r s be an extension of rings r r a faithfully flat ring morphism and set s r r s if r s is quasi pru fer respectively fcp then so is r s proof the pru fer case is clear because faithfully flat morphisms de scend flat epimorphisms scholium a 9 for the quasi pru fer case we use the inc pair characterization and the fact that fr s p fr s p is faithfully flat for p spec r lying over p in r 22 corollaire 3 4 9 the fcp case is proved in 11 theorem 2 2 proposition 3 17 let r s be a ring extension and r r a spectrally surjective ring morphism for example either faithfully flat or injective and integral then r s is quasi pru fer if r r rs is injective for example if r r is faithfully flat and quasi pru fer proof let t r s and p spec r and set t t r r there is some p spec r lying over p because r r is spectrally surjective there is a faithfully flat morphism fr t p fr t p fr t p k p p 22 corollaire 3 4 9 by theorem 2 3 the result follows from the faithful flatness of fr t p fr t rr p theorem 3 18 let r s be a ring extension 1 r s has a greatest quasi pru fer subextension r r r 2 r rr r is quasi pru fer and then r r 3 r r r and r r r proof to see 1 use proposition 3 13 which tells us that the set of all quasi pru fer subextensions is upward directed and then use proposi tion 3 12 to prove the existence of r then let r t r be a tower with r t integral and t r pru fer from t r r r we deduce that t r and then r r 2 now r rr can be factored r r rr and is a tower of quasi pru fer extensions because r r r is integral quasi pru fer extensions 15 3 clearly the integral closure and the pru fer closure of r in r are the respective intersections of r and r with r and r r r this last result means that as long integral closures and pru fer closures of subsets of r are concerned we can suppose that r s is quasi pru fer 4 almost pru fer extensions we next give a definition dual of the definition of a quasi pru fer extension 4 1 arbitrary extensions definition 4 1 a ring extension r s is called an almost pru fer extension if it can be factored r t s where r t is pru fer and t s is integral proposition 4 2 an extension r s is almost pru fer if and only if r s is integral it follows that the subring t of the above definition is r r when r s is almost pru fer proof if r s is almost pru fer there is a factorization r t r r s where t r is both integral and a flat epimorphism by scholium a 4 therefore t r r by scholium a 5 l corollary 4 3 let r s be a quasi pru fer extension and let t r s then t r tr is almost pru fer moreover t r t tr proof t r t is quasi pru fer by corollary 3 3 being integrally closed it is pru fer by corollary 3 5 moreover t tr is an integral extension then t r tr is almost pru fer and t r t tr we note that integral extensions and pru fer extensions are almost pru fer and hence minimal extensions are almost pru fer there are quasi pru fer extensions that are not almost pru fer it is enough to consider 39 example 3 5 1 let r t s be two minimal exten sions where r is local r t integral and t s is pru fer then r s is quasi pru fer but not almost pru fer because s r and r r the same example shows that a composite of almost pru fer extensions may not be almost pru fer but the reverse implication holds 16 g picavet and m picavet theorem 4 4 let r s be an almost pru fer extension then r s is quasi pru fer moreover r r r p r p for each p spec r in this case any flat epimorphic subextension r t is pru fer proof let r r s be an almost pru fer extension that is r s is integral the result follows because r r is pru fer now the morita hull and the pru fer hull coincide by proposition 4 2 in the same way r p r p is a flat epimorphism and r p sp is integral we could define almost pru fer rings as the rings r such that r tot r is almost pru fer but in that case r tot r by theo rem 4 4 so that r is a pru fer ring the converse evidently holds therefore this concept does not define something new we observed in 10 remark 2 9 c that there is an almost pru fer fmc extension r s t where r s is a pru fer minimal exten sion and s t is minimal and integral but r t is not an fcp extension proposition 4 5 let r s be an extension verifying the hypotheses i r s is quasi pru fer ii r s can be factored r t s where r t is a flat epimorphism 1 then the following commutative diagram d is a pushout r r y y t tr tr s is pru fer and r tr is quasi pru fer moreover fr r p ft tr q for each q spec t and p q r 2 if in addition r t is integrally closed d is a pullback t r r r r t tr r and t tr r r t proof 1 consider the injective composite map r r r t tr as r r r t is a flat epimorphism because deduced by a base change of r t we get that the surjective map r r t tr is an isomorphism by scholium a 3 by fibers transitivity we have ft rt q q k p fr r p 22 corollaire 3 4 9 as p q is an isomorphism by scholium a we get that fr r p ft rt q 2 as in 5 lemma 3 5 r t r the first statement on the conductors has the same proof as in 5 lemma 3 5 the second holds because r t is a flat epimorphism see scholium a 6 quasi pru fer extensions 17 theorem 4 6 let r s be a quasi pru fer extension and the diagram d r r y y r r r 1 d is a pushout and a pullback such that r r r and r r r r r r so that r r r r r r 2 r s can be factored r r r r r r r s where the first extension is almost pru fer and the second is pru fer 3 r s is almost pru fer if and only if s rr r r 4 r r r r r is the greatest almost pru fer subextension of r s and r r r 5 supp s r supp r r supp r r if r s is almost pru fer supp can be replaced with msupp proof to show 1 2 in view of theorem 3 18 it is enough to apply proposition 4 5 with t r and s r because r r r is almost pru fer whence quasi pru fer keeping in mind that a pru fer extension is integrally closed whereas an integral pru fer extension is trivial more over r rr because rr r is both integral and integrally closed 3 is obvious 4 now consider an almost pru fer subextension r t u where r t is pru fer and t u is integral applying 3 we see that u r u r u rr in view of proposition 1 6 5 obviously supp r r supp r r supp s r conversely let m spec r be such that rm 6 sm and rm r m rm then 3 entails that sm r m r m rm which is absurd corollary 4 7 let r s be an almost pru fer extension the follow ing conditions are equivalent 1 supp s r supp r r 2 supp s r supp r r 3 supp r r supp r r proof since r s is almost pru fer we get r p r p for each p spec r moreover supp s r supp r r supp r r supp s r supp r r supp s r supp r r 1 2 assume that there exists p supp s r supp r r then r p 6 sp rp so that rp sp is neither pru fer nor integral 18 g picavet and m picavet but p supp s r supp s r supp r r if p supp s r then p 6 supp r r so that r p rp and rp sp is pru fer a contradiction if p supp r r then p 6 supp s r so that r p sp and rp sp is integral a contradiction 2 3 assume that there exists p supp r r supp r r then rp 6 r p r p so that rp sp is neither pru fer nor in tegral but p supp s r supp s r supp r r if p supp s r then p 6 supp r r so that r p rp and rp sp is integral a contradiction if p supp r r then p 6 supp s r so that r p sp and rp sp is pru fer a contradiction 3 1 assume that there exists p supp s r supp r r then r p 6 rp sp so that rp sp is neither pru fer nor integral but p supp s r supp r r supp r r if p supp r r then p 6 supp r r so that r p rp and rp sp is pru fer a contradiction if p supp r r then p 6 supp r r so that r p rp and rp sp is integral a contradiction proposition 4 5 has the following similar statement proved by ayache and dobbs it reduces to theorem 4 6 in case r s has fcp because of proposition 1 3 proposition 4 8 let r t s be a quasi pru fer extension where t s is an integral minimal extension and r t is integrally closed then the diagram d is a pullback s tr and t s r r t proof 5 lemma 3 5 proposition 4 9 let r u s and r v s be two towers of extensions such that r u and r v are almost pru fer then r uv is almost pru fer and u v u v proof denote by u v and w the pru fer hulls of r in u v and w uv we deduce from 26 corollary 5 11 p 53 that r u v is pru fer moreover u v uv is clearly integral and u v w because the pru fer hull is the greatest pru fer subextension we deduce that r uv is almost pru fer and that u v u v proposition 4 10 let r u s and r v s be two towers of extensions such that r u is almost pru fer and r v is a flat epimorphism then u uv is almost pru fer proof mimic the proof of proposition 4 9 and use 26 theorem 5 10 p 53 proposition 4 11 let r s be an almost pru fer extension and r t a flat epimorphism then t t r s is almost pru fer quasi pru fer extensions 19 proof it is enough to use proposition 3 10 and definition 4 1 proposition 4 12 an extension r s is almost pru fer if and only if rp sp is almost pru fer and r p r p for each p spec r proof for an arbitrary extension r s we have r p r p suppose that r s is almost pru fer then so is rp sp and r p r p by theorem 4 4 conversely if r s is locally almost pru fer whence locally quasi pru fer then r s is quasi pru fer if r p r p holds for each p spec r we have sp rr p so that s rr and r s is almost pru fer by theorem 4 6 corollary 4 13 an fcp extension r s is almost pru fer if and only if rp sp is almost pru fer for each p spec r proof it is enough to show that r s is almost pru fer if rp sp is almost pru fer for each p spec r using proposition 4 12 any minimal extension r r 1 is integral by definition of r assume that r p rp so that there exists r 2 r s such that r p r 2 p is a pru fer minimal extension with crucial maximal ideal q r p for some q max r with q r p in particular r r 2 is not integral we may assume that there exists r 1 r r 2 such that r 1 r 2 is a pru fer minimal extension with p 6 supp r 1 r using 39 lemma 1 10 there exists r 2 r r 2 such that r r 2 is a pru fer minimal extension with crucial maximal ideal q a contradic tion then r p sp is integral for each p whence r p rp we now intend to demonstrate that our methods allow us to prove easily some results for instance next statement generalizes 5 corol lary 4 5 and can be fruitful in algebraic number theory proposition 4 14 let r m be a one dimensional local ring and r s a quasi pru fer extension suppose that there is a tower r t s where r t is integrally closed then r s is almost pru fer t r and s is zero dimensional proof because r t is quasi pru fer and integrally closed it is pru fer if some prime ideal of t is lying over m r t is a faithfully flat epimorphism whence an isomorphism by scholium a which is absurd now let n be a prime ideal of t and p n r then rp is zero dimensional and isomorphic to tn therefore t is zero dimensional it follows that tr is zero dimensional since rt s is pru fer we deduce from scholium a that rt s the proof is now complete 20 g picavet and m picavet we also generalize 5 proposition 5 2 as follows proposition 4 15 let r s be a quasi pru fer extension such that r is local with maximal ideal n r r then r is local and r s r r r s if in addition r is one dimensional then either r s is integral or there is some minimal prime ideal p of r such that s r p p sp and r p is a one dimensional valuation domain with quotient field s p proof r is obviously local let t r s r r and s t r then s u s and s 1 r by proposition 1 2 1 but s 1 6 u r so that s 1 n it follows that there exists some integer n such that s n r r giving s nr r or equivalently r rsn t then t r s and we obtain r s r r r s assume that r is one dimensional if r s is not integral then r s is pru fer and r is one dimensional to complete the proof use proposition 1 2 3 4 2 fcp extensions in case we consider only fcp extensions we obtain more results proposition 4 16 let r s be an fcp extension the following statements are equivalent 1 r s is almost pru fer 2 rp sp is either integral or pru fer for each p spec r 3 rp sp is almost pru fer and supp s r supp r r 4 supp r r supp s r proof the equivalence of proposition 4 12 shows that 2 1 holds because t t and over a local ring t an almost pru fer fcp extension t u is either integral or pru fer 39 proposition 2 4 moreover when rp sp is either integral or pru fer it is easy to show that r p r p next we show that 3 is equivalent to 2 of proposition 4 12 let p supp s r supp r r be such that rp sp is almost pru fer then r p 6 rp sp so that rp r p sp since r r is pru fer so is rp r p giving r p r p and rp 6 r p it follows that r p sp in view of the dichotomy principle 39 proposition 3 3 since rp is a local ring and then r p 6 r p conversely assume that r p 6 r p i e p supp s r then rp 6 r p so that r p sp as we have just seen hence rp sp is integrally closed it follows that rp rp rp so that p 6 supp r r and p supp r r by theorem 4 6 5 moreover r p 6 quasi pru fer extensions 21 sp implies that p supp s r to conclude p supp s r supp r r 1 4 an fcp extension is quasi pru fer by corollary 3 4 sup pose that r s is almost pru fer by theorem 4 6 letting u r we get that u r r and s ru we deduce from 39 proposition 3 6 that supp r r supp s r suppose that this last condition holds then by 39 proposition 3 6 r s can be factoredr u s where r u is integrally closed whence pru fer by proposition 1 3 and u s is integral therefore r s is almost pru fer lemma 4 17 let b d and c d be two integral minimal exten sions and a b c if a d has fcp then a d is integral proof set m b d and n c d if m 6 n then a d is integral by 13 proposition 6 6 assume that m n then m max a by 13 proposition 5 7 let b be the integral closure of a in b then m is also an ideal of b which is prime in b and then maximal in b if a d is an fcp extension so is b b which is a flat epimorphism and so is b m b m then b b since b m is a field it follows that a b is an integral extension and so is a d proposition 4 18 let r s be an fcp almost pru fer extension then r r is the least t r s such that t s is integral proof we may assume that r s is not integral if there is some u r r such that u r is integral then u r set x t r s t s integral it follows that r is a minimal element of x we are going to show that r is the least element of x set n r s 1 and let r r 0 r 1 rn 1 rn s be a maximal chain of r s with length n there does not exist a maximal chain of r subalgebras of s with length n let t x we intend to show that t r s it is enough to choose t such that t is a minimal element of x consider the induction hypothesis hn x r s when n r s we first show h 1 if n 1 r s is minimal let t x and t 1 t s be such that t 1 s is minimal assume that t 1 6 r lemma 4 17 shows that t 1 r r is integral which contradicts the beginning of the proof then t 1 r so that t r for the same contradiction and h 1 is proved assume that n 1 and that hk holds for any k n let t x and t 1 t s be such that t 1 s is minimal if t 1 r s then 22 g picavet and m picavet k r t 1 n 1 but we get that t r t 1 with t t 1 integral moreover r is also the pru fer hull ofr t 1 with k r t 1 n 1 since hk holds we get that t r t 1 r s if t 1 6 r s set u t 1 rn 1 we get that t 1 s and rn 1 s are minimal and integral using again lemma 4 17 we get that u s is integral with r rn 1 n 1 and u r rn 1 as before r is also the pru fer hull of r rn 1 since hn 1 holds u r rn 1 so that t 1 r s a contradiction therefore hn is proved we will need a relative version of the support let f r t be a ring morphism and e a t module the relative support of e over r is sr e af suppt e and msr e sr e max r in partic ular for a ring extension r s we have sr s r suppr s r proposition 4 19 let r s be an fcp extension the following statements hold 1 supp r r supp r r 2 supp r r supp r r supp r r supp r r 3 msupp s r msupp r r msupp r r proof 1 is a consequence of proposition 4 16 4 because r r is almost pru fer we prove the first part of 2 if somem supp r r supp r r it can be supposed in max r set r rm u r m t r m and m mrm then r 6 u t with r u fcp pru fer and r t fcp integral an absurdity 39 proposition 3 3 to show the second part assume that some p supp r r supp r r then p 6 supp r r by the first part of 2 so that rp rp giving r p rp r p r p a contradiction 3 obviously msupp s r ms s r ms s t s ms t s t ms t u t ms u t u ms u r by 39 propositions 2 3 and 3 2 we have ms s t s s t s t s r r t ms r r msupp r r ms t u t s r t r s r r supp r r andms u t u s r t r supp r r to conclude msupp s r msupp r r msupp r r proposition 4 20 let r s be an fcp extension andm msupp s r then r m r m if and only if m 6 msupp s r msupp r r proof in fact we are going to show that r m 6 r m if and only if m msupp s r msupp r r quasi pru fer extensions 23 let m msupp s r msupp r r then r m 6 rm sm and then rm r m sm since r r is pru fer so is rm r m by proposition 1 2 giving r m r m and rm 6 r m therefore r m sm 39 proposition 3 3 since rm is local and then r m 6 r m conversely if r m 6 r m then rm 6 r m so that r m sm as we have just seen and then rm sm is integrally closed it follows that rm rm rm so that m 6 msupp r r hence m msupp r r by proposition 4 19 3 moreover r m 6 sm m msupp s r to conclude m msupp s r msupp r r if r s is any ring extension with dim r 0 then r m r m for any m max r indeed by scholium a 2 the flat epimorphism r r is bijective as well as rm r m this conclusion is still valid in another context corollary 4 21 let r s be an fcp extension assume that one of the following conditions is satisfied 1 msupp s r msupp r r 2 s rr or equivalently r s is almost pru fer then r m r m for any m max r proof 1 is proposition 4 20 2 is proposition 4 12 proposition 4 22 let r s be an almost pru fer fcp extension then any t r s is the integral closure of t r in tr proof set u t r and v tr since r s is almost pru fer u r is pru fer and r v is integral and r is also the pru fer hull of u v because r s is almost pru fer for eachm msuppr s r rm sm is either integral or pru fer by proposition 4 16 and so is um vm but r m r m by corollary 4 21 is also the pru fer hull of um vm let t be the integral closure of u in v then t m is the integral closure of um in vm assume that um vm is integral then vm t m and um r m so that vm tm r m tm giving tm t m assume that um vm is pru fer then um t m and vm r m so that um tm r m tm giving tm t m to conclude we get that tm t m for each m msuppr s r since rm sm with tm t m for eachm max r msuppr s r we get t t whence t is the integral closure of u v 24 g picavet and m picavet we build an example of an fcp extension r s where we have r m 6 r m for some m max r in particular r s is not almost pru fer example 4 23 let r be an integral domain with quotient field s and spec r m 1 m 2 p 0 where m 1 6 m 2 are two maximal ideals and p a prime ideal satisfying p m 1 m 2 assume that there are r 1 r 2 and r 3 such that r r 1 is pru fer minimal with c r r 1 m 1 r r 2 is integral minimal with c r r 2 m 2 and r 2 r 3 is pru fer minimal with c r 2 r 3 m 3 max r 2 such that m 3 r m 2 and m 2 r 3 r 3 this last condition is satisfied when r r 2 is either ramified or inert indeed in both cases m 3 r 3 r 3 moreover in the ramified case we have m 2 3 m 2 and in the inert case m 3 m 2 36 theorem 3 3 we apply 13 proposition 7 10 and 10 lemma 2 4 several times set r 2 r 1 r 2 then r 1 r 2 is integral minimal with c r 1 r 2 m 2 m 2 r 1 and r 2 r 2 is pru fer minimal with c r 2 r 2 m 1 m 1 r 2 max r 2 moreover m 1 6 m 3 spec r 1 m 2 p 1 0 where p 1 is the only prime ideal of r 1 lying over p but p r r 1 by 17 proposition 3 3 so that p p 1 set r 3 r 3 r 2 then r 2 r 3 is pru fer minimal with c r 2 r 3 m 3 m 3 r 2 max r 2 and r 3 r 3 is pru fer minimal with c r 3 r 3 m 1 m 1 r 3 max r 3 it follows that we have spec r 3 p 0 where p is the only prime ideal of r 3 lying over p to end assume that r 3 s is pru fer minimal with c r 3 s p hence r 2 is the integral closure of r in s in particular r s has fcp 10 theorems 6 3 and 3 13 and is quasi pru fer since r r 1 is integrally closed we have r 1 r assume that r 1 6 r then there exists t r 1 s such that r 1 t is pru fer minimal and c r 1 t m 2 a contradiction by proposition 4 16 since m 2 c r 1 r 2 with r 1 r 2 integral minimal then r 1 r it follows that m 1 msupp r r but p c r 3 s r supp s r and p m 1 give m 1 msupp s r so that r m 1 6 r m 1 by proposition 4 20 giving that r s is not almost pru fer we now intend to refine theorem 4 6 following the scheme used in 4 proposition 4 for extensions of integral domains proposition 4 24 let r s and u t r s be such that r u is integral and r t is pru fer then u ut is pru fer in the following cases and r ut is almost pru fer 1 supp r r supp r r for example if r s has fcp 2 r u preserves integral closure quasi pru fer extensions 25 proof 1 we have msupp u r msupp t r since u r and t r let m msupp ut r for m msupp u r we have rm tm and ut m um if m msupp u r then um rm and ut m tm so that um ut m identifies to rm tm let n max u and set m n r max r since r u is integral if m 6 supp r r then rm rm um and n is the only maximal ideal of u lying over m it follows that um un and ut m ut n by 10 lemma 2 4 then un ut n identifies to rm tm which is pru fer if m 6 supp r r then rm tm gives um ut m so that un ut n by localizing the precedent equality and un ut n is still pru fer therefore u ut is locally pru fer whence pru fer by proposition 1 1 2 the usual reasoning shows that u r t ut so that u ut is integrally closed since u is contained in r ut we get that u r ut now observe that r ut is almost pru fer whence quasi pru fer it follows that u ut is pru fer next propositions generalize ayache s results of 4 proposition 11 proposition 4 25 let r s be a quasi pru fer extension t t r s and u t t the following statements hold 1 t t r for each t r s 2 t t t t 3 let supp t t supp t t this assumption holds if r s has fcp then t t t t 4 if supp u u supp u u then t t t t proof 1 we observe that r t is quasi pru fer by corollary 3 3 since t r is the integral closure of r in t we get that t r t is pru fer it follows that t r t is pru fer we thus have t t r to prove the reverse inclusion we set v t r and w v t we have w r v r v because v v r is integral and pru fer since we have a tower v v r v therefore v w is pru fer because w v v moreover t t v since v t is pru fer then t w is integral because w t t and we have v t w this entails that t w v t so that t v is pru fer it follows that v t since t v v 2 a quasi pru fer extension is pru fer if and only if it is integrally closed we observe that t t t t is integrally closed whence pru fer it follows that t t t t 26 g picavet and m picavet 3 set u t r and u t r so that u u r r with u u in view of 1 we thus can suppose that t t r r it follows that t t is integral and t t is pru fer we deduce from proposition 4 24 1 that t t t is pru fer so that t t t because supp t t supp t t and t r therefore we have t t 4 assume that supp u u supp u u then t t t t gives t t t t in view of 3 so that t t t t by 2 proposition 4 26 let r s be a quasi pru fer extension and t t a subextension of r s set u t r u t r v tr and v t r the following statements hold 1 t t is integral if and only if v v 2 t t is pru fer if and only if u u 3 assume that u u is integral minimal and v v then t t is integral minimal of the same type as u u 4 assume that v v is pru fer minimal and u u then t t is pru fer minimal 5 assume that t t is minimal and set p c t t a if t t is integral then u u is integral minimal if and only if p u max u b if t t is pru fer then v v is pru fer minimal if and only if there is exactly one prime ideal in v lying over p proof in r s we have the integral extensions u u t v t v and the pru fer extensions v v u t u t moreover r is also the integral closure of u v 1 is gotten by considering the extension t v which is both t v v and t t v 2 is gotten by considering the extension u t which is both u t t and u u t 3 assume that u u is integral minimal and v v then t t is integral by 1 and t 6 t because of 2 set m u u suppu u u for any m max u such that m 6 m we have um u m so that tm t m because um t m is pru fer but u t is almost pru fer giving t tu by theorem 4 6 t t u u t mt 6 t because t 6 t we get that u t pru fer implies that m 6 suppu t u and um tm it follows that t m tmu m u m therefore tm t m identifies to um u m which is minimal of the same type as u u by 13 proposition 4 6 then t t is integral minimal of the same type as u u 4 assume that v v is pru fer minimal and u u then t t is pru fer by 2 and t 6 t because of 1 set q c v v quasi pru fer extensions 27 and p q t max t since q max v for any p max t such that p 6 p and q max v lying above p we have vq v q so that vp v p it follows that t p v p is integral so that tp t p and p 6 suppt t t we get that t t is pru fer minimal in view of 10 proposition 6 12 5 assume that t t is a minimal extension and set p c t t a assume that t t is integral then v v and u 6 u by 1 and 2 we can use proposition 4 5 getting that p u u t max t and q u u p u spec u it follows that q 6 suppu t u so that uq tq and u q t q then uq u q is integral minimal with q suppu u u if q 6 max u then u u is not minimal by the properties of the crucial maximal ideal assume that q max u and let m max u with m 6 q then um u m because m q u so that u u is a minimal extension and a is gotten b assume that t t is pru fer then v 6 v and u u by 1 and 2 moreover pt t gives pv v let q max v lying over p then qv v gives that q suppv v v moreover we have v v t let p max t p 6 p then tp t p gives vp v p it follows that suppt v v p and suppv v v q max v q t p but by 10 proposition 6 12 v v is pru fer minimal if and only if suppv v v 1 and then if and only if there is exactly one prime ideal in v lying over p lemma 4 27 let r s be an fcp almost pru fer extension and u r r v r s then u v has fcp and is almost pru fer proof obviously u v has fcp and r is the integral closure of u in v proposition 4 16 entails that suppr r r suppr s r we claim that suppu r u suppu v r deny and let q suppu r u suppu v r then rq 6 uq vq if p q r we get that rp 6 up vp giving rp 6 rp sp a contradiction another use of proposition 4 16 shows that u v is almost pru fer proposition 4 28 let r s be an fcp almost pru fer extension and t t a subextension of r s set u t r and v t r let w be the pru fer hull of u v then w is also the pru fer hull of t t and t t is an fcp almost pru fer extension proof by lemma 4 27 we get that u v is an fcp almost pru fer extension let t be the pru fer hull of t t since u t and t t are pru fer so is u t and t v gives that t w then t w is pru fer as a subextension of u w 28 g picavet and m picavet moreover in view of proposition 4 18 w is the least u subalgebra of v over which v is integral since t v is integral we get that w t so that w t t with w t integral as a subextension of w v it follows that w is also the pru fer hull of t t and t t is an fcp almost pru fer extension 5 the case of nagata extensions in this section we transfer the quasi pru fer and almost pru fer prop erties to nagata extensions proposition 5 1 let r s be a pru fer and fcp extension then r x s x is a pru fer and fcp extension proof we can suppose that r m is local in order to use proposi tion 1 2 3 then it is enough to know the following facts v x is a valuation domain if so is v r x p x r x p x rp x where p x pr x and r x p x r p x for p spec r if in addition r s is fcp it is enough to use 11 theorem 3 9 r s has fcp if and only if r x s x has fcp proposition 5 2 if r s is quasi pru fer then so is r x s x r x r x r r r x and s x s r r x proof it is enough to use proposition 5 1 because r x r x the third assertion results from 34 proposition 4 and proposition 7 proposition 5 3 if r s is almost pru fer then so is r x s x it follows that r x r x for an almost pru fer extension r s proof if r s is almost pru fer then r r is pru fer and r s is integral and thenr x r x is pru fer and r x s x is integral whence r x s x is almost pru fer with r x r x lemma 5 4 let r s be an fcp ring extension such that r r then r x r x proof if r x 6 r x there is some t r x r x such that r x t is pru fer minimal set c r x t msupp s x r x m there is m msupp s r such that m mr x 11 lemma 3 3 but m 6 msupp r x r x msupp r x r x by proposition 4 19 2 giving that m 6 msupp r r s r r then 39 proposition 1 7 3 entails that m s s r by 39 proposition 1 7 4 there are some t 1 t 2 r s with t 1 t 2 pru fer minimal an fcp extension is quasi pru fer with m c t 1 t 2 r quasi pru fer extensions 29 we can choose for t 1 t 2 the first minimal extension verifying the pre ceding property therefore m 6 s t 1 r so that m 6 s t 1 r supp t 1 r by 39 lemma 1 10 we get that there exists t r t 2 such that r t is pru fer minimal a contradiction proposition 5 5 if r s is an fcp extension then r x r x proof because r r is pru fer r x r x is pru fer by corol lary 5 1 then r x r x assume that r x 6 r x and set t r so that t t giving t x t x r x by lemma 5 4 hence t x r x is a pru fer extension contradicting the definition of t x so r x r x proposition 5 6 let r s be an almost pru fer fcp extension then r x r x r x proof we have a tower r x r x r x r x r x where the first and the third equalities come from theorem 4 4 and the second from proposition 5 5 we end this section with a special result proposition 5 7 let r s be an extension such that r x s x has fip then r x r x proof the map r s r x s x defined by t 7 t x r x r t is bijective 12 theorem 32 whence r x t x for some t r s moreover r x r x is a flat epimorphism since r r x is faithfully flat r t and the result follows 6 fibers of quasi pru fer extensions we intend to complete some results of ayache dobbs 5 we begin by recalling some features about quasi finite ring morphisms a ring morphism r s is called quasi finite by 40 if it is of finite type and p p r s is finite as a p vector space for each p spec r 40 proposition 3 p 40 proposition 6 1 a ring morphism of finite type is incomparable if and only if it is quasi finite and if and only if its fibers are finite proof use 41 corollary 1 8 and the above definition 30 g picavet and m picavet theorem 6 2 an extension r s is quasi pru fer if and only if r t is quasi finite respectively has finite fibers for each t r s such that t is of finite type over r if and only if r t has integral fiber morphisms for each t r s proof it is clear that r s is an inc pair implies the condition because of proposition 6 1 to prove the converse let t r s and write t as the union of its finite type r subalgebras t now let q q be prime ideals of t lying over a prime ideal p of r and set q q t and q q t if r t is quasi finite then q q so that q q and then r t is incomparable the last statement is proposition 3 8 corollary 6 3 an integrally closed extension is pru fer if and only if each of its subextensions r t of finite type has finite fibers proof it is enough to observe that the fibers of a flat epimorphism have a cardinal 1 because an epimorphism is spectrally injective a ring extension r s is called strongly affine if each of its subex tensions r t is of finite type the above considerations show that in this case r s is quasi pru fer if and only if each of its subex tensions r t has finite fibers for example an fcp extension is strongly affine and quasi pru fer we also are interested in extensions r s that are not necessarily strongly affine and such that each of its subextensions r t have finite fibers next lemma will be useful its proof is obvious lemma 6 4 let r s be an extension and t r s 1 if t s is spectrally injective and r t has finite fibers then r s has finite fibers 2 if r t is spectrally injective then t s has finite fibers if and only if r s has finite fibers remark 6 5 let r s be an almost pru fer extension such that the integral extension t r s has finite fibers and let p spec r the study of the finiteness of fibr s p can be reduced as follows as r s is an epimorphism because it is pru fer it is spectrally injective see scholium a the hypotheses of proposition 4 5 hold we examine three cases in case r r 6 p it is well known that rp r p so that fibr s p 1 because r s is spectrally injective suppose now that r r p from r r t s r we deduce that p is lain over by some q spec t and then fibr r p fibt s q the conclusion follows as above thus the remaining case is r r p quasi pru fer extensions 31 and we can assume that pt t for if not fibr r p fibt s q for some q spec t by scholium a 1 proposition 6 6 let r s be an almost pr ufer extension if r s has finite fiber morphisms and r p sp is a maximal ideal of r p for each p suppr s r then r r and r s have finite fibers proof the pru fer closure commutes with the localization at prime ideals by proposition 4 12 we set t r let p be a prime ideal of r and r rp the canonical morphism we clearly have fibr p a fibrp p prp therefore we can localize the data at p and we can assume that r is local in case t s t we get a factorization r r t since r t is pru fer so is r r and it follows that r r because a pru fer extension is integrally closed from proposition 1 2 applied to r t we get that there is some p spec r such that t rp r p is a valuation ring with quotient field t p and p pt it follows that t s pt p r and hence t s t s r r r we have therefore a pushout diagram by theorem 4 6 r r p r p r y y t t p s p s where r p is a valuation domain t p is its quotient field and r p s p is pru fer by 26 proposition 5 8 p 52 because r s is injective and a flat epimorphism there is a bijec tive map min s min r but t s is the fiber at p of t s and is therefore finite therefore min s is a finite set n 1 nn of maximal ideals lying over the minimal prime ideals m 1 mn of r lying over 0 in r we infer from lemma 3 7 that r mi s ni is pru fer whence integrally closed therefore r mi is an integral do main and the integral closure of r in s ni any maximal ideal m of r contains somemi to conclude it is enough to use a result of gilmer 19 corollary 20 3 because the number of maximal ideals in r mi is less than the separable degree of the extension of fields t s ni remark 6 7 1 suppose that r s is a maximal ideal of r we clearly have r s p r p sp and the hypotheses on r s of the above proposition hold 32 g picavet and m picavet 2 in case r s is a tower of finitely many integral minimal extensions ri 1 ri with mi ri 1 ri then suppr s r n 1 nn max r where ni mi r if the ideals ni are dif ferent each localization at ni of r s is integral minimal and the above result may apply this generalizes the ayache dobbs result 5 lemma 3 6 where r s is supposed to be integral minimal proposition 6 8 let r s be a quasi pru fer ring extension 1 r s has finite fibers if and only if r r has finite fibers 2 r r has finite fibers if and only if each extension r t where t r s has finite fibers proof 1 let p spec r and the morphisms p p rr p rs the first second morphism is integral a flat epimorphism because deduced by base change from the integral morphism r r the flat epimorphism r s therefore the ring p r r is zero dimensional so that the second morphism is surjective by scholium a 2 set a p r r and b p r s we thus have a module finite flat ring morphism a b hence aq bq is free for each q spec a 16 proposition 9 and bq 6 0 because it contains p 6 0 therefore aq bq is injective and it follows that a b 2 suppose that r r has finite fibers and let t r s then r rt is a flat epimorphism by proposition 4 5 1 and so is p r r p r rt since spec p r rt spec p r r is injective r rt has finite fibers now r t has finite fibers because t rt is integral and is therefore spectrally surjective remark 6 9 actually the statement 1 is valid if we only suppose that r s is a flat epimorphism next result contains 5 lemma 3 6 gotten after a long proof corollary 6 10 let r s be an almost pru fer extension then r s has finite fibers if and only if r r has finite fibers and if and only if r s has finite fibers proof by proposition 6 8 1 the first equivalence is clear the second is a consequence of lemma 6 4 2 the following result is then clear theorem 6 11 let r s be a quasi pru fer extension with finite fibers then r t has finite fibers for each t r s corollary 6 12 if r s is quasi finite and quasi pru fer then r t has finite fibers for each t r s and r s is module finite quasi pru fer extensions 33 proof by the zariski main theorem there is a factorization r f s where r f is module finite and f s is a flat epimorphism 40 corollaire 2 p 42 to conclude we use scholium a in the rest of the proof the map r r f s is injective because f r r f is a flat epimorphism and is surjective since it is integral and a flat epimorphism because r r f s is a flat epimorphism corollary 6 13 an fmc extension r s is such that r t has finite fibers for each t r s proof such an extension is quasi finite and quasi pru fer then use corollary 6 12 5 example 4 7 exhibits some fmc extension r s such that r r has not fcp actually r r is an infinite maximal chain proposition 6 14 let r s be a quasi pru fer extension such that r r has finite fibers and r is semi local then t is semi local for each t r s proof obviously r is semi local from the tower r tr s we deduce that r tr is pru fer it follows that tr is semi local 5 lemma 2 5 f as t tr is integral we get that t is semi local the following proposition gives a kind of converse proposition 6 15 let r s be an extension with r semi local then r s is quasi pru fer if and only if t is semi local for each t r s proof if r s is quasi pru fer r s is pru fer let t r s and set t tr so that t t is integral and r t is pru fer and then a normal pair it follows from 5 lemma 2 5 f that t is semi local and so is t if t is semi local for each t r s so is any t r s then r s is a residually algebraic pair 6 theorem 3 10 generalized to arbitrary extensions and so is rm sm for each m max r whence is pru fer 6 theorem 2 5 same remark and proposition 1 2 then r s is pru fer by proposition 1 1 and r s is quasi pru fer 7 numerical properties of fcp extensions lemma 7 1 let r s be an fcp extension the map r s t t r r r s suppt r t suppt t r defined by t t r rt for each t r s is bijective in particular if r s has fip then r s r r r s 34 g picavet and m picavet proof let t t r r r s then r is also the integral closure of t in t and in s let t r s set t t r and t rt then t t r r r s assume that t t so that t t r giving t r and suppt r t suppt t r assume that t 6 t in view of 39 proposition 3 6 we get suppt r t suppt t r hence is well defined now let t 1 t 2 r s be such that t 1 t 2 t t assume t 6 t another use of 39 proposition 3 6 gives that t 1 t 2 if t t then t t r so that t 1 t 2 r it follows that is injective the same reference gives that is bijective proposition 7 2 let r s be a fcp extension we define two order isomorphisms and as follows r r r r r r defined by t t r tr r r r r r r defined by t t r t r proof this follows from 39 lemma 3 7 and proposition 4 19 we recall that r r corollary 7 3 if r s has fcp then supp r r supp r r supp r r supp r r and supp r r supp r r supp r r proof set a supp r r b supp r r c supp r r and d supp r r then a b c d supp r r with a b c d b d by proposition 4 19 assume that a b 6 b d and let p a b b d then rp 6 r p r p r p rp a contradiction it follows that a b b d intersecting the two members of this equality with a and d we get a a d d in the same way intersecting the equality a b c d c a by b and c we get b c corollary 7 4 let r s be an fcp extension we define two order isomorphisms 1 r r r r by 1 t tr 1 r r r r by 1 t tr proof we use notation of proposition 4 19 we begin to remark that r and r play symmetric roles let t t r r be such that 1 t 1 t since t r t r r by proposition 4 19 we get t t so that t t and 1 is injective a similar argument shows that 1 is injective quasi pru fer extensions 35 let u r r there exists t r r such that t r u so that r t r and u tr let m supp r r supp r r supp r r by corollary 7 3 ifm supp r r thenm 6 supp r r by proposition 4 19 giving tm r m rm r m r m if m supp r r the same reasoning gives tm rm so that rm tm rm tm but rm r m then tm r m it follows that t r giving t r r and 1 is surjective hence bijective a similar argu ment shows that 1 is surjective hence bijective corollary 7 5 if r s has fcp then r r r r r r defined by t t tt is an order isomorphism in particular if r s has fip then r r r r r r r s proof using notation of proposition 7 2 and corollary 7 4 we may remark that id 1 since and id 1 are order isomorphisms so is the fip case is obvious gathering the previous results we get the following theorem theorem 7 6 if r s has fcp the next statements are equivalent 1 supp r r supp s r 2 the map r s r r r s defined by t t r tr is an order isomorphism 3 r s is almost pru fer 4 supp s r supp r r 5 the map 1 r r r s defined by 1 t tr is an order isomorphism 6 the map 1 r r r s defined by 1 t tr is an order isomorphism 7 the map r r r r r s defined by t t tt is an order isomorphism if one of these conditions holds then supp s r supp r r if r s has fip the former conditions are equivalent to each of the following conditions 8 r s r r r r 9 r s r r r s 10 r r r s 11 r r r s proof 1 2 by 39 lemma 3 7 36 g picavet and m picavet 2 1 if the statement 2 holds there exists t r s such that t r r and tr s then 39 proposition 3 6 gives that supp r r supp s r 1 3 by 39 proposition 3 6 3 4 5 6 and 7 use corollary 7 3 to get 4 corollary 7 4 to get 5 and 6 and corollary 7 5 to get 7 moreover 3 and corollary 7 3 give supp s r supp r r 4 1 by proposition 4 19 2 5 6 or 7 3 because in each case we have s rr assume now that r s has fip then obviously 7 8 2 9 5 10 and 6 11 9 3 by corollary 7 5 which gives r r r r r r so that r s r r and then s r 8 1 using the map of lemma 7 1 we get that t t r r r s suppt r t suppt t r r r r s so that suppr r r suppr s r 10 3 and 11 3 by corollary 7 4 example 7 7 we give an example where the results of theorem 7 6 do not hold if r s has not fcp set r zp and s q x x 2 where p max z then r q because r r is pru fer minimal and r s is integral minimal setm prp max r with r m a local ring it follows that m supp r r supp s r because r s is neither integral nor pru fer similarly m supp r r supp r r indeed r r has not fcp we end the paper by some length computations in the fcp case proposition 7 8 let r s be an fcp extension the following statements hold 1 r r r r and r r r r 2 r r r r r r r r r r 3 r r suppr r r r r suppr r r proof to prove 1 use the maps 1 and 1 of corollary 7 4 then 2 follows from 11 theorem 4 11 and 3 from 10 proposition 6 12 references 1 d f anderson and d e
