ideal in a noetherian ring r let e 2 be an integer let te r u ti u 1 e r u 1 e t 1 e where t is an indeterminate and u 1 t and let re u 1 ete then the itoh e valuation rings of i are the rings te z p z where p varies over the height one associated prime ideals of re and z is the unique minimal prime ideal in te that is contained in p we show among other things 1 re is a radical ideal if and only if e is a common multiple of the rees integers of i 2 for each integer k 2 there is a one to one correspondence between the itoh k valuation rings v n of i and the rees valuation rings w q of ur u ti namely if f u is the quotient field of w then v is the integral closure of w in f u 1 k 3 for each integer k 2 if v n and w q are corresponding valuation rings as in 2 then v is a finite integral extension domain of w and w and v satisfy the fundamental equality with no splitting also if uw qe and if the greatest common divisor of e and k is d and c is the integer such that cd k then qv n c and v n w q d further if uw qe and k qe is a multiple of e then there exists a unit e v such that v w e u 1 k is a finite free integral extension domain of w qv n q n u 1 k v and v w k 4 if the rees integers of i are all equal to e then v w e is a simple free integral extension domain of w qv n u 1 ev and v w e v n w q 1 introduction all rings in this paper are commutative and have an identity element 1 6 0 and our terminology is mainly as in nagata 7 thus a basis of an ideal is a generating set of the ideal the term altitude refers to what is often called dimension or krull dimension and for a pair of local rings r m and s n s dominates r in case r s and n r m and we then write r s or s n r m in 1988 shiroh itoh proved the following interesting and useful theorem in 5 p 392 lines 3 11 the terminology is defined in section 2 1 http arxiv org abs 1607 05341 v 1 theorem 1 1 let i be a regular proper ideal in a noetherian ring r let r r u ti be the rees ring of r with respect to i let w 1 q 1 wn qn be the rees valuation rings of ur for j 1 n let uwj qj ej so e 1 en are the rees integers of i and let e 2 be an arbitrary common multiple of e 1 en also let s r u 1 e let t s r u 1 e t 1 e and let r u 1 et then 1 1 1 r is a radical ideal so the rees integers of r and of u 1 es a are all equal to one 1 1 2 there is a one to one correspondence between the rees valuation rings v n of r and the rees valuation rings w q of ur namely if f u is the quotient field of w then v is the integral closure of w in f u 1 e 1 1 3 let v n and w q be corresponding rees valuation rings of r and ur re spectively as in 1 1 2 so w wj for some j 1 n then qv n e ej so the ramification index of v relative to w is equal to e ej actually the only part of this theorem that s itoh specifically stated in 5 was that r is a radical ideal when e is the least common multiple of e 1 en his proof of this essentially shows that 1 1 1 1 1 3 hold but his goals in 5 were to prove several nice applications of the radicality of the ideal r not to find additional properties of the rees valuation rings of this ideal however it turns out that the rees valuation rings of ideals like r have some additional nice properties and the goal of this present paper is to derive some of these properties to facilitate discussing these valuation rings we make the following definition definition 1 2 for an arbitrary integer e 2 the itoh e valuation rings of i are the rees valuation rings of re u 1 ete where te r u ti u 1 e r u 1 e t 1 e 2 definitions and known results in this section we recall the needed definitions and mention the needed known results concerning them definition 2 1 let i be an ideal in a ring r then 2 1 1 r denotes the integral closure of r in its total quotient ring 2 2 1 2 ia denotes the integral closure of i inr so ia is the ideal x r x is a root of an equation of the form xn i 1 x n 1 in 0 where ij i j for j 1 n the ideal i is integrally closed in case i ia 2 1 3 the rees ring of r with resect to i is the graded subring r r i r u ti of r u t where t is an indeterminate and u 1 t 2 1 4 assume that r is noetherian and that i is a regular proper ideal in r that is i contains a regular element of r and i 6 r and let b 1 bg be regular elements in r that generate i for i 1 g let ci r i bi let pi 1 pi ni be the height one associated prime ideals of bici see 2 1 1 let zi j be the unique see remark 2 2 1 below minimal prime ideal in ci that is contained in pi j possibly zi h zi j for some h 6 j or zi j 0 and let vi j ci zi j pi j zi j so vi j is a dvr then the set rv i of all vi j i 1 g and j 1 ni is the set of rees valuation rings of i the rees valuation rings of i are well defined by i they do not depend on the basis b 1 bg of i 2 1 5 if v n is a rees valuation ring of i see 2 1 4 then the rees integer of i with respect to v is the positive integer e such that iv n e if rv i v 1 1 n 1 1 vg ng ng ng and if ivi j ni j ei j for i 1 g and j 1 ni then e 1 1 eg ng are called the rees integers of i 2 1 6 if w q v n are dvrs such that v is a localization of an integral extension domain of w then the ramification index of v relative to w is the positive integer k such that qv n k remark 2 2 let i be a regular proper ideal in a noetherian ring r then 2 2 1 concerning 2 1 4 it is shown in 9 definition p 213 and propositions 2 7 and 2 13 that if b is a regular nonunit in the integral closure a of a noetherian ring a then ba has a finite primary decomposition each associated prime ideal p of ba has height one p contains exactly one associated prime ideal z of 0 and a z p z is a dvr 2 2 2 it is shown in 11 proposition 10 2 3 that if v 1 vn are the rees valuation rings of i then ik a i kvj r j 1 n for all k n 0 n 0 denotes the set of positive integers 2 2 3 it readily follows from definition 2 1 4 that the set rv i of rees valuation rings of i is the disjoint union of the sets rv i z z where z runs over the minimal prime 3 ideals w in r such that i w 6 r also if v is a rees valuation ring of i and of i z z then the rees integer of i with respect to v is the rees integer of i z z with respect to v 2 2 4 it follows from definition 2 1 4 and is proved in 11 example 10 3 2 that if i br is a regular proper principal ideal in r then the rees valuation rings of i are the rings r z p z where p varies over the height one associated prime ideals of br and z is the unique minimal prime ideal in r that is contained in p it is readily checked that if a r r 1 b then there is a one to one correspondence between the associated prime ideals p of br and the associated prime ideals q of ba namely q p a and then r z p z a z q z where z z a 2 2 5 it follows from definitions 2 1 4 and 2 1 5 that if a is a ring such that r a r then i and ia have the same rees valuation rings and the same rees integers and it also follows that for all positive integers k ia and ika have the same rees valuation rings 2 2 6 it is well known and is readily proved much as in the proof of 1 2 5 that if r is a noetherian integral domain and a is an integral extension domain of r then the rees valuation rings of ia are the extensions of the rees valuation rings of i to the quotient field of a the following theorem is a special case of 13 theorems 19 and 20 pp 55 and 60 61 the terminology fundamental inequality is due to o endler in 2 pp 127 128 theorem 2 3 fundamental inequality let v n be a dvr with quotient field f let e be a finite algebraic extension field of f let e f e let v 1 n 1 vn nn be all of the valuation rings of e that are extensions of v to e so the integral closure v of v in e has exactly n maximal ideals m 1 mn and vj v mj j 1 n and for j 1 n let nvj nj ej and vj nj v n fj then fi n j 1 ejfj e and the equality holds if the integral closure v of v in e is a finite v module terminology 2 4 if v n and v 1 n 1 vn nn are as in theorem 2 3 if n 1 and if the equality in fi holds then it will be said that v n and v 1 n 1 satisfy the fundamental equality with no splitting 4 notation 2 5 if r is an integral domain then r 0 denotes the quotient field of r therefore if s is a finite algebraic extension domain of r then s 0 r 0 denotes the dimension of the quotient field s 0 of s over the quotient field r 0 of r if s is a finite free integral extension domain of r and if it is clear that the rank of s is equal to s 0 r 0 then we often write s r in place of s 0 r 0 the next three propositions are known but we do not know specific references for them so we sketch their proofs proposition 2 6 let w q be a dvr let q w let f 2 be an integer let d w 1 f and let p 1 f d then d is a dvr that is a simple free integral extension domain of w p is the maximal ideal in d qd p f d 0 w 0 f and d p w q therefore w and d satisfy the fundamental equality with no splitting see terminology 2 4 proof p q 1 f d is a maximal ideal in d since d p w q is a field and p 1 f d is a principal ideal since q is generated by also d is integral over w and q is the unique maximal ideal in w so every maximal ideal in d contains qd so it follows that p is the only maximal ideal in d hence d is a dvr it therefore follows that qd p f therefore since d 0 w 0 f it follows from the fundamental inequality fi that d 0 w 0 f hence d is a simple free integral extension domain of w thus by 2 4 the last statement is clear proposition 2 7 let m be a maximal ideal in a noetherian ring r and let m x be a monic polynomial in r x if the image m x of m x in r m x is irreducible then m x is irreducible in r x mr x is a maximal ideal in r x r x m x r x and r x is a simple free integral extension ring of r of rank equal to deg m x proof by considering the maps r x r m x r m where is a root of the irreducible by hypothesis polynomial m x in r m x it follows that m x is irre ducible inr x m m x r x is a maximal ideal mr x m m x r x m x r x is a maximal ideal in r x and r x is a simple free integral extension ring of r of rank equal to deg m x 5 proposition 2 8 let i be a regular proper ideal in a noetherian ring r let b 1 bg be regular elements in i that are a basis of i and let r r u ti be the rees ring of r with respect to i then there exists a one to one correspondence between the rees valua tion rings v n of i and the rees valuation rings w q of ur u ti namely if v r i bi z p z where i 1 g p is an associated prime ideal of bir i bi and z is the minimal prime ideal in r i bi that is contained in p then w v tbi nv tbi where tbi t bi z and q nw note that tbi tbi z where z zr u t r u ti corresponds to t bi in the isomorphism between r u ti z and r z u t i z z see 10 proof since t is transcendental over r and u 1 t there is a one to one correspondence between the minimal prime ideals z in r and the minimal prime ideals z in r namely z zr u t r and then z z r thus it follows from remark 2 2 3 that it suffices to prove this proposition for the case when r is a noetherian integral domain therefore assume that r is a noetherian domain fix b b 1 bg let c r i b and let c r 1 tb so r 1 tb c c tb 1 tb also uc bc so since tb is transcendental over c there exists a one to one correspondence between the height one associated prime ideals p of bc and the height one associated prime ideals p of uc namely p pc and p p c therefore there exists a one to one correspondence between the dvrs v c p and the dvrs w c p and for corresponding v and w if v r i b p and n pv then w v tb nv tb and q nw pw it follows that for each rees valuation ring v n of i of the form v r i b p the ring w v tb pv tb is a rees valuation ring of ur and w r 0 v finally let w be a rees valuation ring of ur say w r p where p is a height one associated prime ideal of ur see remark 2 2 4 to complete the proof of the one to one correspondence it suffices to show that there exists b b 1 bg and a rees valuation ring v n of i such that v r i b p and w v tb nv tb for this tb p for some b b 1 bg by 8 lemma 3 2 the assumption in 8 that r is analytically unramified is not used in the proof of lemma 3 2 therefore w r 1 tb p where p p w r 1 tb so p is a height one associated prime ideal of ur 1 tb br 1 tb and r 1 tb c tb 1 tb where c r i b let p p c then p is a height one 6 associated prime ideal of bc and p pc tb 1 tb so it follows from the second preceding paragraph that w v tb nv tb where v c p and n pv 3 properties of itoh e valuation rings in this section we show that itoh e valuation rings have several nice properties for this we need the following proposition which is essentially a corollary of proposition 2 7 proposition 3 1 let i be a regular proper ideal in a noetherian ring r let b 1 bg be regular elements in i that generate i and let r r u ti be the rees ring of r with respect to i let v n and w q be corresponding as in proposition 2 8 rees valuation rings of i and ur respectively say v r i b z p z where b b 1 bg p is a height one associated prime ideal of br i b and z is the minimal prime ideal in r i b that is contained in p so w v tb nv tb where b b z let e 2 be an integer let v v n let me x x e v tb and let e be a root of me x in a fixed algebraic closure of the quotient field of w then u w e is a dvr that is a simple free integral extension domain of w qu is its maximal ideal and u w e u qu w q therefore w and u satisfy the fundamental equality with no splitting see terminology 2 4 proof since w v tb nv tb with tb transcendental over v and q nw is an extended ideal from v tb q w q is transcendental over v n so it follows that the image me x w q x of me x is irreducible hence w q y w q e where y x me x w q x therefore it follows from proposition 2 7 that me x is irreducible in the ufd w x m qu is a principal maximal ideal where u w e and u w e further u is integral over w and q is the unique maximal ideal in w so every maximal ideal in u contains the maximal ideal qu hence u is a dvr that is a simple free integral extension domain of w and m is its maximal ideal therefore by 2 4 the last statement is clear our first theorem theorem 3 2 is an expanded version of itoh s theorem see theorem 1 1 note that 1 1 3 is proved in 3 2 5 theorem 3 2 let i be a regular proper ideal in a noetherian ring r let b 1 bg be regular elements in i that are a basis of i let v 1 n 1 vn nn be the rees valuation 7 rings of i let e 1 en be the rees integers of i let e be an arbitrary common multiple of e 1 en and let fj e ej j 1 n also let r r u ti be the rees ring of r with respect to i let s r u 1 e let t s r u 1 e t 1 e and let r u 1 et then 3 2 1 r is a radical ideal 3 2 2 there is a one to one correspondence between the itoh e valuation rings v n of i and the rees valuation rings w q of ur namely given w if f u is the quotient field of w then v is the integral closure of w in f u 1 e 3 2 3 let w q and v n be corresponding as in 3 2 2 valuation rings and let v n v be the rees valuation ring of i that corresponds as in proposition 2 8 to w so v w v and nw q assume that v vj so iv n ej nj ej then there exists a unit v such that u p w n w is an itoh ej valuation ring of i that is a simple free integral extension domain of w and p qu is the maximal ideal in u so the ramification index of u relative to w is equal to one see definition 2 1 6 also qu u yu where y u 1 ej and u w ej u p w q therefore w and u satisfy the fundamental equality with no splitting 3 2 4 let v n u p v n with v vj be as in 3 2 3 then there exists a nonunit x v such that v u x is a simple free integral extension domain of u n xv where x y 1 fj with y u 1 ej as in 3 2 3 so x u 1 e and pv n fj so the ramification index of v relative to u is equal to fj also v u fj and v n u p so u and v satisfy the fundamental equality with no splitting 3 2 5 v w x n xv u 1 ev where is as in 3 2 3 and x is as in 3 2 4 and v is a finite free integral extension domain of w also the ramification index of v relative to w is equal to fj v n w q ej and v w e so w and v satisfy the fundamental equality with no splitting 3 2 6 assume that e 1 en e and let w q and u w be as in 3 2 3 then v u is a simple free integral extension domain of w p qu u 1 eu is the maximal ideal in u and u w ej u p w q therefore w and v u satisfy the fundamental equality with no splitting and u 1 et is a radical ideal where t r u ti u 1 e r u 1 e t 1 e 8 proof we first prove 3 2 3 3 2 5 for this fix an itoh e valuation ring v n of i then by definitions 1 2 and 2 1 4 there exists a height one associated prime ideal p of u 1 et and a minimal prime ideal z p such that v t z p z since t r u 1 e t 1 e and t and r u 1 e t 1 e have the same total quotient ring it follows that z z r u 1 e t 1 e r is a minimal prime ideal in r and z zr u 1 e t 1 e t also z zr u t r is a minimal prime ideal in r and z r z let f be the quotient field of r z so f u resp f u 1 e is the quotient field of r z resp v and t z also by definition 1 2 v is a rees valuation ring of u 1 et so v is also a rees valuation ring of u 1 et z z by remark 2 2 3 so v is also a rees valuation ring of ut z z by remark 2 2 5 therefore w v f u is a rees valuation ring of the ideal ur z z by remark 2 2 6 and so also of ur by remark 2 2 3 hence v is an extension of w to f u 1 e let v be the rees valuation ring of i that corresponds as in proposition 2 8 to w and assume that v vj c z p z where c is the integral closure of c r i b in its total quotient ring b b 1 bg p is a height one associated prime ideal of bc and z is the unique minimal prime ideal in c that is contained in p let n and q be the maximal ideals in v and w respectively then q nw by proposition 2 8 so 3 2 7 tb q w q is transcendental over v n where b b z let n v so by hypothesis bv iv n ej ejv therefore uw bw iw qej ejw so 3 2 8 there exist units v v and w w such that b v ej and u w ej since b u tb see the last part of proposition 2 8 it follows from 3 2 8 that 3 2 9 w v tb let w 1 ej in a fixed algebraic closure f u of f u and let u w then it follows from proposition 3 1 that u is a dvr that is a simple free integral extension domain of w qu is its maximal ideal u w ej u qu w q and w and u satisfy the fundamental equality with no splitting 9 continuing with the proof of 3 2 3 we next show that u v and we first show that v for this w ej u by 3 2 8 w 1 ej and u 1 e v so w ej 1 ej u 1 ej u 1 e fj v hence u 1 ej v further q v so is in the quotient field f u 1 e of v moreover w 1 ej is integral over w and is a unit w v and v is integrally closed in f u 1 e so v and is a unit in v therefore u w v and u 1 ej u u u qu n u is the maximal ideal in u thus to complete the proof of 3 2 3 it remains to show that u is an itoh ej valuation ring of i for this u w w u 1 ej r u 1 ej tej r where tej r u ti u 1 ej r u 1 ej t 1 ej and p r p w r q r is a height one associated prime ideal of ur so p tej q say is a height one associated prime ideal of u 1 ej tej since u 1 ej p therefore u tej q tej q is an itoh ej valuation ring of i and u and tej q are dvrs with the same quotient field so u tej q is an itoh ej valuation ring of i thus 3 2 3 holds for 3 2 4 let y u 1 ej let x y 1 fj so x u 1 e since ej fj e and let d u x by 3 2 3 p yu is the maximal ideal in u so it follows from proposition 2 6 that d is a dvr that is a simple free integral extension domain of u qu d p fj where p 1 fj d is the maximal ideal in d so d p u p d u fj and u and d satisfy the fundamental equality with no splitting further since u 1 e x d d and v have the same quotient field f u 1 e thus v and d are dvrs in f u 1 e and d v so it follows that d v and p n therefore 3 2 4 holds it follows from 3 2 3 and 3 2 4 that v w x w u 1 e is a finite free integral extension domain of w that n xv u 1 ev and that v w ej fj e also since the ramification index of u over w is equal to one by 3 2 3 and the ramification index of v d over u is equal to fj by 3 2 4 it follows that the ramification index of v over w is equal to fj further u p w q ej by 3 2 3 and v n u p by 3 2 4 so v n w q ej thus it follows that w and v satisfy the fundamental equality with no splitting hence 3 2 5 holds moreover since v is a finite free integral extension domain of w and since v is integrally closed it follows that v is the integral closure of w wj in the quotient field 10 f u 1 e of v therefore it has been shown that if v is an itoh e valuation ring of i then v t z p z for some height one associated prime ideal p of u 1 et where z is the minimal prime ideal in t that is contained in p z z r and z z r are minimal prime ideals in r and r respectively and if f resp f u is the quotient field of r z resp r z then v is the integral closure of w v f u in f u 1 e and w is a rees valuation ring of ur and of ur z z it follows that each itoh e valuation ring v with quotient field f u 1 e corresponds to the rees valuation ring w v f u of ur on the other hand if w is a rees valuation ring of ur then w r z p z for some height one associated prime ideal p of ur where z is the minimal prime ideal in r that is contained in p z z r and z zr u 1 e t 1 e t are minimal prime ideals in r and t respectively and if f resp f u 1 e is the quotient field of r z resp t z and w is the integral closure of w in f u 1 e then for each maximal ideal m in w w m is a rees valuation ring of ut z z and of u 1 et z z by remarks 2 2 6 and 2 2 5 so each v m is a rees valuation ring of ut and of u 1 et by remark 2 2 3 hence each such w m is an itoh e valuation ring of i by definition 1 2 it therefore follows from the first part of this paragraph that w has exactly one maximal ideal so the one to one correspondence of 3 2 2 holds for 3 2 1 u 1 ev n by 3 2 4 therefore since v is an arbitrary itoh e valuation ring of i it follows from definitions 1 2 and 2 1 5 that the rees integers of u 1 et are all equal to one also since t r u 1 e r u 1 e t 1 e by 9 remarks ii p 215 it follows that u 1 et u 1 et a therefore it follows from remark 2 2 2 that r u 1 et u 1 et a u 1 evj t j 1 n nj t j 1 n is a radical ideal thus 3 2 1 holds so 3 2 1 3 2 5 hold finally for 3 2 6 let w be a rees valuation ring of ur let v be the corresponding as in 3 2 2 itoh e valuation ring of i and let u be as in 3 2 3 so w u v then there exists j 1 n such that u w ej by 3 2 3 e by the hypothesis in 3 2 6 v w by 3 2 5 so v u is a simple free integral extension domain of w also p n u 1 ev by 3 2 5 u 1 eu since this holds for all itoh e valuation rings u p of i u 1 et is a radical ideal hence 3 2 6 holds concerning theorem 3 2 6 it is shown in corollary 4 12 below that there always exists 11 a finite integral extension ring a of r such that the rees integers of ia are all equal to e where e is an arbitrary common multiple of the rees integers e 1 en of i so theorem 3 2 6 directly applies to ia in place of i remark 3 3 let v n be a rees valuation ring of i and assume that iv nk let w q be the rees valuation ring of ur u ti that corresponds as in proposition 2 8 to v and let h be an arbitrary positive integer then it follows from theorem 3 2 3 and 3 2 4 that u w u 1 k and d w u 1 hk u u 1 k 1 h are dvrs that are finite free integral extension domains of w the maximal ideal of u resp d is p u 1 ku resp m u 1 hkd the ramification index of d relative to u resp u relative to w is equal to h resp 1 d u h and u w k and d m u p and u p w q k it therefore follows that w and u resp w and d u and d satisfy the fundamental equality with no splitting also it follows from theorem 3 2 3 resp 3 2 4 that u resp d is an itoh k valuation resp hk valuation ring of i remark 3 4 the following result is called the theorem of independence of valuations and it is proved in 7 11 11 let v 1 n 1 vn nn be valuation rings with the same quotient field f and assume there are no containment relations among the vj let v v 1 vn and let pj nj v j 1 n then p 1 pn are the maximal ideals in v and vj vpj for j 1 n corollary 3 5 let i b 1 bg r be a nonzero proper ideal in a noetherian integral domain r let f be the quotient field of r let r r u ti let w 1 q 1 wn qn be the rees valuation rings of ur let e be a positive common multiple of the rees integers e 1 en of ur let w w 1 wn and let d w x where x u 1 e in a fixed algebraic closure f u of f u then 1 w is a semi local dedekind domain with exactly n maximal ideals pj qj w j 1 n 2 d is a simple free integral extension domain of w of rank e and d has exactly n maximal ideals mj pj x d 3 there exist distinct elements 1 n in the quotient field f x of d such that 3 1 d is the intersection of the itoh e valuation rings v 1 n 1 vn nn of i where vj wj j x d mj where mj nj d 12 3 2 d d 1 n is a semi local dedekind domain that is a finite integral extension domain of d and d has exactly n maximal ideals mj nj d pj x 1 j 1 j 1 n d 3 3 the jacobson radical of d is xd 4 assume that e 1 en e and that there exists b i such that bwj iwj for j 1 n then with d as in 3 1 and qj jwj for j 1 n x 1 n is a unit in d d d x 1 n w x 1 n and xd is the jacobson radical of d proof 1 and part of 3 1 follow immediately from the independence of valuations the orem see remark 3 4 the first part of 2 is clear also each mj is a maximal ideal in d since d mj wj qj further u resp x is in the jacobson radical of w resp d xd w uw since d is a free w algebra and d xd w uw so it follows that w w uw d and d xd each have exactly n maximal ideals so 2 holds for 3 for j 1 n let vj nj be the rees valuation ring of i that corresponds as in proposition 2 8 to wj qj so there exists b j where 1 n 1 g in b 1 bg such that vj r i b j pj for some height one prime ideal pj in r i b j so wj vj tb j njvj tb j wj f vj and qj f nj let v v 1 vn and for j 1 n let qj nj v then v w f and w v u s where s v u q 1 v u qnv u and qj qj f v qj w v pj v for j 1 n therefore it follows from the independence of valuations theorem see remark 3 4 that v is a semi local dedekind domain with exactly n maximal ideals qj j 1 n thus v is a principal ideal domain by 12 theorem 16 p 278 so for j 1 n there exists j qj such that qj jv so jvj nj v vqj nj jw qjw pj v w pj and jwj qjwqj w pjwj qj then since the rees integers of ur are e 1 en by hypothesis uw p 1 e 1 pn en p 1 e 1 pn en 1 e 1 n enw so there exists a unit w w such that u w 1 e 1 n en hence 1 there exists a unit wj wj such that u wj j ej inwj wpj for j 1 n where 2 wj u ej j w i 6 j ei i i 6 j pi pj for j 1 n 13 also since ej is the rees integer of i with respect to vj and ivj b j vj there exists a unit vj vj such that 3 b j vj j ej in vj for j 1 n therefore since b j u tb j in r wj it follows from 3 and 1 that vj j ej b j u tb j wj j ej tb j hence 4 wj vj tb j and wj pj is transcendental over v pj v for j 1 n therefore 5 mej x x ej wj pj is irreducible in w pj x for j 1 n for j 1 n let j wj 1 ej in the fixed algebraic closure f u of f u then it is shown in theorem 3 2 3 3 2 5 that for the itoh e valuation ring vj of i 6 vj wj j x and j is a unit in vj for j 1 n also v 1 vn is the integral closure w of w in f x by theorem 3 2 2 and x u 1 e w since u w so it follows that w w x d further for j 1 n j wj 1 ej w by 2 and 6 and by 2 1 j 1 j 1 n nj w nj d mj for j 1 n hence by 2 and 6 we see that 7 for i 1 n i nj d j 1 i 1 i 1 n ni d let e d 1 n then for j 1 n x d e w by 2 and 6 vj wj j x therefore wj wnj w dnj d enj e w nj w vj wj x j enj e so vj enj e for j 1 n also d and w have exactly n maximal ideals so it follows from integral dependence that e has exactly n maximal ideals further for each integral domain a a am m is a maximal ideal in a by 7 33 9 therefore it follows that e d 1 n v 1 vn d thus 3 1 and 3 2 hold 14 3 3 follows immediately from theorem 3 2 4 finally for 4 let vj nj be the rees valuation ring of i that corresponds as in proposition 2 8 to wj qj then it follows from the hypothesis on b that for j 1 n wj vj tb njvj tb and qj njwj let v v 1 vn so by remark 3 4 v is a semi local dedekind domain with exactly n maximal ideals nj v pj v thus v is a principal ideal domain by 12 theorem 16 p 278 so for j 1 n there exists j nj v such that jv nj v let 1 n let n n 1 nn and let q q 1 qn then since the rees integers of i are all equal to e it follows that 3 5 4 1 iv bv ne ev and iw uw qe ew it follows from 3 5 4 1 that 3 5 4 2 there exist units v v and w w such that b v e v and u w e w since b u tb in r w and since qj njvj tb njvj tb for j 1 n it follows from 3 5 4 2 that 3 5 4 3 w v tb and w pj is

together with 3 5 4 4 that me x is irreducible in the ufd w x for j 1 n mj pje is a principal maximal ideal where e w and e w e also e is integral over w so it follows that m 1 mn are the only nonzero prime ideals in e hence e is a semi local dedekind domain that is a simple free integral extension domain of w and qe q 1 qn e m 1 mn e 1 ne e is its jacobson radical j therefore d e w d and since w u e is a unit in w it follows that w 1 e x is a unit in d and that j e xe the next remark lists several well known facts concerning finite field extensions and ramification 15 remark 3 6 let u 1 p 1 u 2 p 2 u 3 p 3 be dvrs such that u 3 is a finite integral extension of u 1 then 1 u 3 0 u 1 0 u 3 0 u 2 0 u 2 0 u 1 0 2 u 3 p 3 u 1 p 1 u 3 p 3 u 2 p 2 u 2 p 2 u 1 p 1 also if we let r 3 1 resp r 3 2 r 2 1 denote the ramification index of u 3 relative to u 1 resp u 3 relative to u 2 u 2 relative to u 1 then 3 r 3 1 r 3 2 r 2 1 further if u 1 and u 3 satisfy the fundamental equality with no splitting then 4 r 3 1 u 3 p 3 u 1 p 1 u 3 0 u 1 0 it then follows from 1 4 and the fundamental inequality 2 3 that 5 r 3 2 u 3 p 3 u 2 p 2 u 3 0 u 2 0 6 r 2 1 u 2 p 2 u 1 p 1 u 2 0 u 1 0 7 hence if u 1 and u 3 satisfy the fundamental equality with no splitting then both u 1 and u 2 and u 2 and u 3 satisfy the fundamental equality with no splitting the next proposition shows that theorem 3 2 2 holds for all integers greater than one proposition 3 7 with the notation of theorem 3 2 let k 2 be an arbitrary integer let sk r u 1 k and let tk sk r u 1 k t 1 k then 1 there exists a one to one correspondence between the itoh k valuation rings u p of i and the rees valuation rings w q of ur namely given w if f u is the quotient field of w then u is the integral closure of w in f u 1 k 2 let w and u be corresponding as in 1 then u is a finite integral extension domain of w and w and u satisfy the fundamental equality with no splitting proof let m be the least common multiple of e 1 en and let e k m then it is clear that r tk te r u 1 e r u 1 e t 1 e and that te is integral over r also by theorem 3 2 2 there exists a one to one correspondence between the rees valuation rings w q of ur and the itoh e valuation rings v n of i and v is the integral closure of w in the quotient field of v it follows from this and integral dependence that 1 holds for 2 it follows from the proof of 1 that if w and v are as in 1 then there exists an itoh k valuation ring u of i such that w u v also v is a finite free integral 16 extension domain of w by theorem 3 2 5 hence u is a finite integral extension domain of w further w and v satisfy the fundamental equality with no splitting by theorem 3 2 5 so it follows from remark 3 6 7 that 2 holds terminology 3 8 if w q is a rees valuation ring of ur u ti and u p is the cor responding as in proposition 3 7 1 itoh k valuation ring of i so u w and u is the integral closure of w in the quotient field f u 1 k of u then we say that u p is the itoh k valuation ring of i that corresponds to w q also if v n is the rees valuation ring of i that corresponds as in proposition 2 8 to w q then we say that u p is the itoh k valuation ring of i that corresponds to v n proposition 3 9 let i be a regular proper ideal in a noetherian ring r let v n be a rees valuation ring of i let w q be the rees valuation ring of ur u ti that corresponds as in proposition 2 8 to v n and let uk pk be the itoh k valuation ring of i that corresponds to v n see 3 8 where k 2 is an arbitrary integer assume that iv n e then the following hold 1 if e is a multiple of k then pk nuk and uk 0 w 0 k uk pk w q 2 if e and k are relatively prime then nuk pk k uk 0 w 0 k and uk pk w q 3 if the greatest common divisor of e and k is d and if c n 0 is such that cd k then nuk pk c uk 0 w 0 k and uk pk w q d proof for 1 let ue pe be the itoh e valuation ring of i that corresponds to v n then it follows from remark 3 3 that pe nue and ue 0 w 0 e ue pe w q also it is clear that w uk ue and that uk 0 w 0 k item 1 readily follows from this together with remark 3 6 1 3 6 3 for 2 let uke pke be the itoh ke valuation ring of i that corresponds to v n then it follows from remark 3 3 that pke k nuke uke 0 w 0 ke and uke pke w q e also it is clear that w uk uke and that uk 0 w 0 k since e and k are relatively prime 2 readily follows from this together with remark 3 6 2 3 6 3 and 3 6 7 17 for 3 let uc pc resp ud pd be the itoh c valuation resp d valuation ring of i that corresponds to v n since cd k it follows that w uc uk and w ud uk since e is a multiple of d it follows from 1 that a qud pd and ud 0 w 0 d ud pd w q since c and e are relatively prime it follows from 2 that b quc pc c and uc pc w q it follows from a b and remark 3 6 2 3 6 3 and 3 6 7 that 3 holds proposition 3 10 gives several equivalences to property 3 2 1 of theorem 3 2 and also shows that the hypothesis of theorem 3 2 is necessary for 3 2 1 proposition 3 10 let i be a regular proper ideal in a noetherian ring r let r r u ti be the rees ring of r with respect to i let k 2 be an arbitrary integer let sk r u 1 k and let tk sk r u 1 k t 1 k then the following statements are equivalent 1 u 1 ktk is a radical ideal 2 the rees integers of u 1 ktk are all equal to one 3 the rees integers of u 1 ksk a are all equal to one 4 k is a common multiple of the rees integers of i proof a primary decomposition of the regular proper principal radical ideal u 1 ktk together with remark 2 2 4 shows that 1 2 and the next to last paragraph of the proof of theorem 3 2 shows that 2 1 also 2 3 by remark 2 2 5 since sk tk sk assume that 2 holds and let v 1 n 1 vn nn be the itoh k valuation rings of i so u 1 kvj nj for j 1 n for j 1 n let uwj qj ej whererv ur u ti wj qj j 1 n suppose that k is not a multiple of ej for some j let d be the greatest common divisor of k and ej and let c 1 and h 1 be integers such that cd k and hd ej then it follows from proposition 3 9 3 with wj qj resp vj nj in place of w q resp uk pk that qjvj nj c since uwj qj ej it follows that u 1 kvj nj cej k nj h however h 1 and this contradicts 2 therefore the supposition that k is not a multiple of ej leads to a contradiction hence 2 4 18 finally 4 1 by theorem 3 2 1 corollary 3 11 let i be a regular proper ideal in a noetherian ring r let r r u ti be the rees ring of r with respect to i and for each integer k 2 let sk r u 1 k and let tk sk r u 1 k t 1 k then the following statements are equivalent 1 the rees integers of i are all equal to one 2 for all integers k 2 the ideal u 1 ktk is a radical ideal proof this follows immediately from proposition 3 10 1 4 4 a related theorem in this section we first prove an expanded version of corollary 3 5 and theorem 3 2 6 and we then prove a closely related and more general theorem the next theorem is an expanded version of corollary 3 5 and theorem 3 2 6 one of the main reasons for including this theorem is to show that it displays except for separability a realization see definition 4 3 below of a powerful classical method this is explained somewhat more fully in remark 4 4 below theorem 4 1 let i be a nonzero proper ideal in a noetherian integral domain r let f be the quotient field of r let r r u ti let w 1 q 1 wn qn be the rees valuation rings of ur let e be a positive common multiple of the rees integers e 1 en of ur let w w 1 wn let q q 1 qn and for j 1 n let pj qj w so w is a semi local dedekind domain q is its jacobson radical and the ideals p 1 pn are the maximal ideals in w then there exists an integral domain e with an ideal j such that 4 1 1 e w x is a semi local dedekind domain that is a finite integral extension domain of w where x u 1 e in a fixed algebraic closure f u of f u 4 1 2 e 0 w 0 e 4 1 3 j xe

e and if there exists b i such that bv iv for each rees valuation ring v n of i then there exists a unit e such that e w so e is a simple free integral extension domain of w of rank e 4 1 8 e ts where t r u ti u 1 e r u 1 e t 1 e and s t q q is a height one associated prime ideal of u 1 et proof it is shown in corollary 3 5 1 that w is a semi local dedekind domain q is its jacobson radical and the ideals p 1 pn are the maximal ideals in w 4 1 1 follows from corollary 3 5 1 and corollary 3 5 3 2 note e is frequently denoted by d in corollary 3 5 and its proof 4 1 2 follows from corollary 3 5 2 4 1 3 is proved in corollary 3 5 3 3 and corollary 3 5 3 2 for 4 1 4 it is shown in corollary 3 5 3 and 3 5 3 2 that there exist 1 n e such that e w x 1 n and mj pj x 1 j 1 j 1 n e therefore e mj w j pj wj qj j pj and vj nj wj x j nj wj qj j pj so e mj vj nj for j 1 n also w pj wj qj for j 1 n therefore 4 1 4 follows from theorem 3 2 5 since ie ue 4 1 5 follows from corollary 3 5 3 3 and then 4 1 6 follows from 4 1 5 and definition 2 1 5 4 1 7 is proved in corollary 3 5 4 finally for 4 1 8 e w x is the intersection of the itoh e valuation rings of i by corollary 3 5 3 1 also ts is the intersection of the itoh e valuation rings of i by definition 1 2 so e ts so 4 1 8 holds we next consider a powerful classical theorem of krull and to state the theorem we use the following terminology of gilmer in 3 definition 4 2 let v 1 n 1 vn nn be distinct dvrs of a field f and for j 1 n let kj vj nj denote the residue field of vj let m be a positive integer by an m consistent system for v 1 vn we mean a collection of sets s s 1 sn satisfying the following conditions 1 for each j sj kj i fj i ej i i 1 sj where kj i is a simple algebraic field extension of kj with fj i kj i kj and sj ej i n 0 20 2 for each j the sum sj i 1 ej ifj i m definition 4 3 the m consistent system s as in definition 4 2 is said to be realizable if there exists a separable algebraic extension field l of f such that 1 l f m 2 for j 1 n vj has exactly sj extensions vj 1 vj sj to l 3 for j 1 n the residue field of vj i is kj isomorphic to kj i and the ramification index of vj i relative to vj is equal to ej i so njvj i nj i ej i if s and l are as above we say the field l realizes s or that l is a realization of s remark 4 4 4 4 1 with definition 4 3 in mind and with the notation of theorem 4 1 the semi local dedekind domain e w x or its quotient field f x in theorem 4 1 is except for separability a realization of the e consistent system s s 1 sn for the rees valuation rings w 1 q 1 wn qn of ur u ti here e is an arbitrary positive common multiple of the rees integers e 1 en of ur u ti and of i and for j 1 n sj wj qj j ej e ej where j is a root of x ej wj with wj playing the role of w in 3 5 4 3 in the proof of corollary 3 5 and j j qjwj j 4 4 2 more generally let i be a nonzero proper ideal in a noetherian integral domain r let r r u ti be the rees ring of r with respect to i let w 1 q 1 wn qn be the rees valuation rings of ur let w w 1 wn and let k 2 be an arbitrary integer for j 1 n let ej be the rees integer of ur with respect to wj and let dj be the greatest common divisor of k and ej also let f be the quotient field of r let f u be an algebraic closure of f u and let e be the integral closure of w xk where xk u 1 k f u then e is a realization of the k consistent system s s 1 sn for the valuation rings w 1 q 1 wn qn here for j 1 n sj wj qj j k dj k dj where j k is a root of xej k wj k with wj k playing the roll of w in 3 5 4 3 in the proof of corollary 3 5 and j k j k qjwj j k proof item 4 4 1 follows immediately from theorem 4 1 it follows from proposition 3 9 1 that qjwj j is a prime ideal and item 4 4 2 follows from proposition 3 9 3 theorem 4 5 krull 6 let v 1 n 1 vn nn be distinct dvrs of a field f with kj vj nj for j 1 n let m be a positive integer and let s s 1 sn be an 21 m consistent system for v 1 vn with sj kj i fj i ej i i 1 sj for j 1 n then s is realizable if one of the following conditions is satisfied 1 sj 1 for at least one j 2 f has at least one dvr v distinct from v 1 vn 3 for each monic polynomial xt a 1 x t 1 at with ai n j 1 vj d and for each h n 0 there exists an irreducible separable polynomial x t b 1 x t 1 bt d x with bl al nj h for each l 1 t and j 1 n observation a condition 1 of theorem 4 5 is a property of them consistent system s s 1 sn b condition 2 of theorem 4 5 is a property of the family of dvrs of the field f c condition 3 of theorem 4 5 is a property of the family v 1 n 1 vn nn remark 4 6 let r be a noetherian integral domain with quotient field f and assume that altitude r 2 then there exist infinitely many height one prime ideals in r so r has infinitely many height one prime ideals by the lying over theorem 7 10 8 therefore since r is a krull domain by 7 33 10 there exist infinitely many distinct dvrs with quotient field f hence theorem 4 5 2 is always satisfied for such fields f we can now state and prove the first new result in this section it is closely related to theorem 4 1 and it is also considerably more general theorem 4 7 let r be a noetherian integral domain with quotient field f and assume that altitude r 2 let i be a nonzero proper ideal in r let v 1 n 1 vn nn n 2 be the rees valuation rings of i let d v 1 vn so d is a dedekind domain with exactly n maximal ideals mj nj d j 1 n and let m 1 e 1 mn en m 1 e 1 mn en be an irredundant primary decomposition of id so e 1 en are the rees integers of i let m be the least common multiple of e 1 en let dj m ej j 1 n and let e km be a positive multiple of m then there exists an integral domain e with an ideal j such that 4 7 1 e d is a semi local dedekind domain that is a simple free separable integral extension domain of d 4 7 2 e d e 22 4 7 3 j is the jacobson radical of e and e has exactly k e 1 en maximal ideals 4 7 4 e qj i d mj 1 for j 1 n and for the kej associated prime ideals qj i of mje 4 7 5 ie jm 4 7 6 the rees integers of ie are all equal to m proof let s s 1 sn with sj kj i 1 dj i 1 kej j 1 n observe that dj kej km e for j 1 n so s is an e consistent system for dm 1 dmn so s is a realizable e consistent system for dm 1 dmn by theorem 4 5 2 and remark 4 6 therefore the integral closure e of d in a realization l of s for dm 1 dmn is a simple free separable integral extension domain of d such that e d e and e is a dedekind domain by 12 theorem 19 p 281 also since sj kj i 1 dj i 1 kej j 1 n each vj has exactly kej extensions vj i nj i to l e v 1 1 vn ken and qj i nj i e e qj i vj i nj i vj nj d mj j 1 n and i 1 kej and njvj i nj i dj j 1 n and i 1 kej therefore 4 7 1 4 7 4 hold and ie n j 1 mj eje n j 1 kej i 1 nj i dj ej n j 1 kej i 1 nj i m jm where j n j 1 kej i 1 nj i is the jacobson radical j of e thus ie j e so 4 7 5 holds and since e is a semi local domain with jacobson radical j 4 7 6 follows immediately from 4 7 5 definition 2 1 5 and remark 2 2 4 remark 4 8 in the proof of proposition 4 7 there are many cases when the simpler e consistent system t t 1 tn with tj kj 1 kej dj j 1 n can be used in place of sj kj i 1 dj i 1 kej j 1 n and then the resulting realization e of t for dm 1 dmn has the same number of maximal ideals as d however t cannot always be used since for example if d mj is algebraically closed and kej 2 then there are no extension fields kj 1 of kj d mj such that kj 1 kj kej remark 4 9 in the proof of proposition 4 7 if sj kj i 1 dj i 1 kej is replaced with uj kj i 1 kdj i 1 ej j 1 n then the same conclusions hold but replace 23 a each vj has exactly kej extensions vj i nj i to l with each vj has exactly ej extensions vj i nj i to l b the rees integers of ie are all equal to m with the rees integers of ie are all equal to e c ie jm with ie je d njvj i nj i dj j 1 n and i 1 kej with njvj i nj i kdj j 1 n and i 1 ej e ie n j 1 mj eje n j 1 kej i 1 nj i dj ej n j 1 kej i 1 nj i m with ie n j 1 mj eje n j 1 ej i 1 nj i kdj ej n j 1 ej i 1 nj i e our first corollary of theorem 4 7 is a more complete and detailed version of 4 theorem 2 8 1 corollary 4 10 let i be a nonzero proper ideal in a noetherian domain r let v 1 n 1 vn nn n 2 be the rees valuation rings of i let ej be the rees integer of i with respect to vj j 1 n and let e km be a positive multiple of the least common multiple m of e 1 en then there exists an integral domain be such that 1 be is a semi local dedekind domain that is a simple free separable integral extension domain of r 2 be r e 3 the rees integers of ibe are all equal to m proof let d be the intersection of the n rees valuation rings vj nj of i and let mj nj d j 1 n so d is a semi local dedekind domain with exactly n maximal ideals mj and id m 1 e 1 mn en m 1 e 1 mn en therefore by proposition 4 7 there exists a simple free separable extension field le of the quotient field f of r such that le f e the integral closure ee of d in le is a finite by free separability integral extension domain of d and is a semi local dedekind domain with exactly kej maximal ideals qj i lying over each mj j 1 n and id ee je m where je is the jacobson radical of ee by separability le f so there exists r r such that r is integral over r so let be r r then be is a simple free separable integral extension domain of r be r e and ee is the intersection of the rees valuation rings of ibe by remark 2 2 6 since 24 ibe ee id ee je m and since je is the jacobson radical of ee it follows that the rees integers of ibe are all equal to m remark 4 11 4 11 1 with the notation of corollary 4 10 there exists an integral domain ce such that 1 ce is a semi local dedekind domain that is a simple free separable integral extension domain of r 2 ce r e 3 the rees integers of ice are all equal to e 4 11 2 let i be a regular proper ideal in a noetherian ring r let v 1 n 1 vn nn n 2 be the rees valuation rings of i let ej be the rees integer of i with respect to vj j 1 n and let e km be a positive multiple of the least common multiple m of e 1 en assume that rad 0 r is prime say rad 0 r z then there exists a ring be such that 1 be is a simple free integral extension ring of r 2 be r e 3 the rees integers of ibe are all equal to m 4 zbe rad 0 be so zbe is the only minimal prime ideal in be 4 11 3 with the notation of 4 11 2 there exists a ring ce such that 1 ce is a simple free integral extension ring of r 2 ce r e 3 the rees integers of ice are all equal to e 4 zce rad 0 ce so zce is the only minimal prime ideal in ce proof the proof of 4 11 1 is the same as the proof of corollary 4 10 but use remark 4 9 in place of proposition 4 7 for 4 11 2 since rad 0 r z is the only minimal prime ideal in r the rees valuation rings of i are the rees valuation rings of i i z z see remark 2 2 3 also by corollary 4 10 there exists an integral domain be such that 1 be is a semi local dedekind domain that is a simple free separable integral extension domain of r r z 2 be r e 25 3 the rees integers of ibe are all equal to m let fe x be the pre image in r x of the irreducible monic polynomial fe x of degree e in r x such that be r x fe x r x then be r x fe x z r x r x zr x where x x fe x r x let be r x then since be r x zr x is an integral domain it follows that zbe is a prime ideal also by hypothesis there exists r n 0 such that z r 0 in r so it follows that zbe is the only minimal prime ideal in be so 4 holds therefore the rees valuation rings and rees integers of ibe are the rees valuation rings and rees integers of ibe by remark 2 2 3 so 1 3 follow immediately from 1 3 the proof of 4 11 3 is the same as the proof of 4 11 2 but use remark 4 11 1 in place of corollary 4 10 the next corollary of theorem 4 7 extends corollary 4 10 to noetherian rings corollary 4 12 let i be a regular proper ideal in a noetherian ring r let e 1 en be the rees integers of i let m be the least common multiple of e 1 en and let e km be a positive multiple of m then there exist rings r and be such that 1 r r be and be is a finite integral extension ring of r 2 ir and ibe are regular proper ideals 3 there is a one to one correspondence between the minimal prime ideals w in be such that ibe w 6 be the minimal prime ideals z in r such that ir z 6 r and the minimal prime ideals z in r such that i z 6 r namely w z be and z z r 4 the rees integers of ibe are all equal to e proof let 0 qh h 1 k be an irredundant primary decomposition of the zero ideal in r and let rad qh zh h 1 k assume that the zh are re ordered so that z 1 zd 1 are the minimal prime ideals z in r such that i z 6 r and zd 1 1 zd 2 are the remaining minimal prime ideals in r so d 1 d 2 k rewrite qh h 1 k as zh h 1 d 2 where zh is the intersection of all qi such that zi zh for h 1 d 2 for i 1 d 2 let ri r zi let zi zi zi so the unique minimal prime ideal in ri is zi therefore zi rad 0 ri and let ii i zi zi so ii is a regular proper ideal in ri for i 1 d 1 and ii ri for i d 1 1 d 2 26 by remark 2 2 3 the set of rees valuation rings of i is the disjoint union of the sets of rees valuation rings of the ideals ii i 1 d 1 so the rees integers of the ii are among the rees integers of i hence e is a multiple of the least common multiple of the rees integers of the ideals ii i 1 d 1 therefore by remark 4 11 3 for i 1 d 1 there exists a simple free integral exten sion ring bi e of ri such that bi e ri e the rees integers of iibi e are all equal to e and zibi e is the only minimal prime ideal in bi e let r r 1 rd 2 let i i 1 id 2 so i ir and for i 1 d 2 let zi r 1 ri 1 zi ri 1 rd 2 then r is a finite integral extension ring of r i is a regular proper ideal in r and for i 1 d 1 the zi are the minimal prime ideals z in r such that i z 6 r also zi r zi and r zi ri zi r zi i 1 d 2 so the rees valuation rings of i are the rees valuation rings of i so the ideals i and i have the same rees integers let be b 1 e bd 2 e where for notational convenience we let bh e rh for h d 1 1 d 2 also for i 1 d 2 let wi b 1 e bi 1 e zibi e bi 1 e bd 2 e so wi r zi and wi zi be then be is a finite r module and is also a finite integral extension ring of r ibe i be ib 1 e ibd 1 e bd 1 1 e bd 2 e is a regular proper ideal in be the wi are d 2 minimal prime ideals in be and be wi bi e zibi e for i 1 d 2 since the ideals zi are the minimal prime ideals z in r such that i z 6 r for i 1 d 1 and since wi is a minimal prime ideal in be such that wi zi be it follows that the wi i 1 d 1 are the minimal prime ideals w in be such that ibe w i be w 6 be so the set of rees valuation rings of i be is the disjoint union of the sets of rees valuation rings of the ideals i be wi wi i be zi be wi b 1 e bi 1 e ii zi bi e bi 1 e bd 2 e wi iibi e zibi e zibi e therefore since zibi e is the unique minimal prime ideal in bi e it follows that for i 1 d 1 iibi e and iibi e zibi e zibi e have the same rees valuation rings and the same rees integers finally for i 1 d 1 the rees integers of iibi e are all equal to e by the last sentence in the second preceding paragraph so it follows that the rees integers of ibe are all equal 27 to e to state an additional corollary we need the following definition definition 4 13 let i and j be ideals in a ring r then 4 13 1 i and j are projectively equivalent in case there exist i j n 0 such that ii a j j a see 2 1 2 4 13 2 i is projectively full in case for each ideal j in r that is projectively equivalent to i see 4 13 1 ja i k a for some k n 0 remark 4 14 with definition 4 13 in mind it should be noted that theorem 4 7 6 shows that the jacobson radical j of e is projectively equivalent to ie and since e is a semi local dedekind domain it follows that j is a projectively full radical ideal whose rees integers are all equal to one the next corollary of theorem 4 7 was proved in 4 theorem 2 8 2 in the case when r is a noetherian domain of altitude one corollary 4 15 if r is a noetherian ring of altitude one then for each regular proper ideal i in r there exists a finite integral extension ring a of r with an ideal j such that j and ia are projectively equivalent j is a projectively full radical ideal and the rees integers of i are all equal to one proof it is shown in 4 theorem 2 8 2 that this result holds for nonzero proper ideals in noetherian domains of altitude one so a proof similar to the proof of corollary 4 12 shows that it continues to hold for regular proper ideals in noetherian rings of altitude one references 1 c ciuperca w j heinzer l j ratliff jr and d e rush projectively full ideals in noetherian rings ii j
