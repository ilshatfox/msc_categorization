commutative rings we consider the lattice r s of all the r subalgebras of s we assume that the poset r s is both artinian and noetherian that is r s is an fcp extension the loewy series of such lattices are studied most of main results are gotten in case these posets are distributive which occurs for integrally closed extensions in general the situation is much more complicated we give a dis cussion for finite field extensions 1 introduction and notation if l is a complete lattice with smallest and greatest elements its socle s l is defined as the supremum of all its atoms then the loewy series of l is defined by transfinite induction where in par ticular si 1 l s si l for a positive integer i see section 3 for more details when l is the lattice of submodules of a module the loewy series of l is a well known topic and its theory a long chapter of algebra even when the base ring is non commutative in this paper we consider the category of commutative and unital rings whose epimorphisms will be involved if r s is a ring extension we denote by r s the set of all r subalgebras of s and set r s r s r s with a similar definition for r s or r s we will consider lattices of the following form for an extension r s the poset r s is a complete lattice where the supremum of any non void subset is the compositum of its elements which we call product from now on and denote by when necessary and the infimum of any non void subset is the intersection of its elements we emphasize on the following if r s is a ring extension our main interest is in the properties of the loewy series related to the lattice r s and not 2010 mathematics subject classification primary 13 b 02 13 b 21 13 b 22 06 e 05 06 d 05 secondary 13 b 30 12 f 10 key words and phrases fip fcp extension

submodules r c submodules of s r where c is the conductor of r s although there are some relations moreover we only consider extensions of finite length in a sense defined below so that loewy lengths are finite in this paper as a general rule an extension r s is said to have some property of lattices if r s has this property we use lattice definitions and properties described in 17 the extension r s is said to have fip for the finitely many intermediate algebras property or is an fip extension if r s is finite a chain of r subalgebras of s is a set of elements of r s that are pairwise comparable with respect to inclusion we will say that r s is chained if r s is a chain we also say that the extension r s has fcp or is an fcp extension if each chain in r s is finite clearly each extension that satisfies fip must also satisfy fcp dobbs and the authors characterized fcp and fip extensions 6 this paper is a continuation of our earlier paper 26 where we con sidered boolean ring extensions it is devoted to the study of loewy series of an fcp distributive extension a notion linked to boolean extensions as much as possible we give results for fcp extensions that are not necessarily distributive in particular for the behavior of the loewy series with respect to classical constructions of ring theory it may be asked whether the distributivity property may be replaced with the modular condition since the lattice of submodules of a module is evidently modular in a forthcoming paper we study distributive extensions note that integrally closed fcp extensions are distributive our main tool will be the minimal ring extensions a concept that was introduced by ferrand olivier 10 in our context minimal exten sions coincide with atoms they are completely known see section 2 recall that an extension r s is called minimal if r s r s the key connection between the above ideas is that if r s has fcp then any maximal necessarily finite chain c of r subalgebras of s r r 0 r 1 rn 1 rn s with length c n re sults from juxtaposing n minimal extensions ri ri 1 0 i n 1 an fcp extension is finitely generated and module finite if integral for any extension r s the length r s of r s is the supremum of the lengths of chains of r subalgebras of s notice that if r s has fcp then there does exist some maximal chain of r subalgebras of s with length r s 7 theorem 4 11 any undefined material is explained at the end of the section or in the next sections loewy 3 section 2 is devoted to some recalls and results on ring extensions and their lattice properties in section 3 we study the loewy series of a arbitrary fcp exten sion as a first property the loewy series behaves well with respect to localization proposition 3 14 let r s be a distributive fcp extension proposition 3 8 shows that the loewy series s 0 r si sn s is such that si si 1 is a boolean ex tension for each i 0 n 1 in particular theorem 3 25 gives a characterization of such extensions verifying r s ni 0 si si 1 we give computations of loewy series for some special extensions or some subextensions for example for nagata extensions we also show how to compute the loewy series of some modules by using the loewy series of a ring extension we give many examples for instance if r s is an fcp almost pru fer extension with pru fer hull r the loewy series of r s is gotten by using the loewy series of r r and r r corollary 3 35 note here that ring extensions whose loewy length is 1 are for example boolean extensions and pointwise minimal extensions corollary 3 9 and proposition 3 12 section 4 specially deals with field extensions we begin with the characterization of the loewy series of a finite field extension k l by means of the loewy series of k t and k u where t resp u is the separable resp radicial closure of k l proposition 4 3 loewy series of finite cyclic field extensions they are necessarily distributive are completely determined in theorem 4 13 we denote by r s the conductor of r s the integral closure of r in s is denoted by r s or by r if no confusion can occur the characteristic of a field k is denoted by c k a purely inseparable field extension is called radicial in this paper in particular if k l is a radicial fip field extension then k l is a chain finally x is the cardinality of a set x denotes proper inclusion and for a positive integer n we set nn 1 n 2 recalls and results on ring extensions this section is devoted to two types of recalls commutative rings and lattices 2 1 rings and ring extensions a local ring is here what is called elsewhere a quasi local ring as usual spec r and max r are the set of prime and maximal ideals of a ring r the support of an r module e is suppr e p spec r ep 6 0 and msuppr e suppr e max r if e is an r module lr e also denoted l m is its length 4 g picavet and m picavet if r s is a ring extension and p spec r then sp is both the localization sr p as a ring and the localization at p of the r module s we denote by r p the residual field rp prp at p an extension r s is called locally minimal if rp sp is minimal for each p supp s r or equivalently for each p msupp s r the following notions and results are deeply involved in the sequel definition 2 1 3 definition 2 10 an extension r s is called m crucial if supp s r m such m is called the crucial maximal ideal c r s of r s theorem 2 2 10 the ore me 2 2 a minimal extension is crucial and is either integral module finite or a flat epimorphism recall that an extension r s is called pru fer if r t is a flat epimorphism for each t r s or equivalent if r s is a normal pair 15 theorem 5 2 in 24 we called an extension which is a minimal flat epimorphism a pru fer minimal extension three types of minimal integral extensions exist characterized in the next theorem a consequence of the fundamental lemma of ferrand olivier so that there are four types of minimal extensions mutually exclusive theorem 2 3 6 theorem 2 2 let r t be an extension and m r t then r t is minimal and finite if and only if m max r and one of the following three conditions holds a inert case m max t and r m t m is a minimal field extension b decomposed case there exist m 1 m 2 max t such that m m 1 m 2 and the natural maps r m t m 1 and r m t m 2 are both isomorphisms c ramified case there exists m max t such that m 2 m m t m r m 2 and the natural map r m t m is an isomorphism in each of the above cases m c r t 2 2 lattice properties letr s be an fcp extension then r s is a complete noetherian artinian lattice r being the least element and s the largest in the context of the lattice r s some definitions and properties of lattices have the following formulations see 17 an element t r s is called 1 irreducible resp irreducible if t t 1 t 2 resp t t 1 t 2 implies t t 1 or t t 2 2 an atom resp a co atom if and only if r t resp t s is a minimal extension therefore an atom resp a co atom is irreducible resp irreducible we denote by a resp ca the set loewy 5 of atoms resp co atoms of r s theorems 2 2 and 2 3 show that there are four types of atoms 3 essential if t 6 r and u t 6 r for each u r s if n is an r submodule of an r module m then n is essential as a submodule if n n 6 0 for any submodule n 6 0 of m clearly t is essential if t r is an essential submodule of the r module s r 4 r s is called catenarian or graded by some authors if r s has fcp and all maximal chains between two comparable elements have the same length 5 r s is called distributive if intersection and product are each distributive with respect to the other actually each distributivity implies the other 17 exercise 5 page 33 6 let t r s then t r s is called a complement of t if t t r and tt s 7 an extension r s is called boolean if r s is a dis tributive lattice such that each t r s has a necessarily unique complement proposition 2 4 12 theorem 1 p 172 a distributive lattice of finite length is catenarian the jordan ho lder chain condition holds proposition 2 5 if r s has fcp then t r s is irreducible resp irreducible if and only if either t s resp t r or there is a unique t r s such that t t resp t t is minimal proof obvious definition 2 6 a ring extension r s is called arithmetic if rp sp is a chain for each p spec r an arithmetic extension is distributive by 22 proposition 5 18 in the next proposition we need the following definition a ring extension r s is called quadratic if each t s is a zero of a monic quadratic polynomial over r 14 definition page 430 proposition 2 7 let r s be a ring extension and let t r s 1 if t r is an essential r submodule of s r then t is an es sential r subalgebra of s 2 if in addition r s is quadratic then t is an essential r subalgebra of s if and only if t r is an essential r submodule of s r proof 1 obvious 2 one part is 1 assume that r s is quadratic and that t is an essential r subalgebra of s let n be a nonzero r submodule 6 g picavet and m picavet of s r there exists an r submodule n of s containing r such that n n r let t n r then r r t r rt n because t satisfies a monic quadratic polynomial over r it follows that r 6 t r t t n which shows that 0 6 t r n r t r n and t r is an essential r submodule of s r remark 2 8 there exist ring extensions such that the equivalence of 2 in proposition 2 7 does not hold let k l be a radicial fip extension of degree p 2 where c k p there exists a unique k k l such that k k p because k l is a chain so that k l k k l then k and l are both essential k subalgebras of s but k k is not an essential k vector subspace of l k indeed l k p 2 shows that there exists a basis x 1 xp 2 of the k vector space l such that x 1 xp is a basis of the k vector spacek let v k kxp 1 then v k k k 0 although v k 6 0 3 the loewy series of an fcp distributive extension we first note that a distributive fcp extension r s has fip 27 theorem 4 28 in this section we associate a chain in r s to the lattice r s called the loewy series of r s definition 3 1 4 definitions pages 47 51 and 77 17 page 29 let r s be an fcp extension a the set of atoms of r s ca the set of co atoms and e the set of essential elements 1 the socle of the extension r s is s r s a aa 2 the radical of the extension r s is r r s a caa 3 the loewy series of the extension r s is the chain si ni 0 defined by induction as follows s 0 r s 1 s r s and for each i 0 such that si 6 s we set si 1 s si s 4 the loewy length r s of the extension r s is the least integer n such that s sn of course since r s has fcp there is some integer n such that sn sn 1 s proposition 3 2 let r s be an fcp extension then r s r s lr s r proof since the loewy series si ni 0 of r s is a chain which is not necessarily maximal we have r s n 1 i 0 si si 1 n r s now it exists rj mi 0 a maximal chain such thatm r s 7 theorem 4 11 then lr s r m 1 j 0 lr rj 1 rj 18 theo rem 6 page 20 with lr rj 1 rj 1 for each j 0 m so that lr s r r s loewy 7 proposition 3 3 let r s be an fcp extension then s r s e ee and is the least element of e proof by definition s r s a a a let t e and a a then r t a a shows that t a a since r a is minimal which leads to a t so that any element of a is contained in any element of e in particular s r s e ee let u r s since r s has fcp there exists some a a such that a u so that a u a but a s r s shows that r a u s r s then s r s is essential and gives the result we recall that an r module n 6 0 is called simple if it is an atom in the lattice n of r submodules of n which is equivalent to n rx for any nonzero x n 17 lemma 2 4 1 in the following corollary we set ms r s n s r n n r simple in s r ms r s stands for module socle in view of 17 page 52 ms r s is the intersection of the r submodules n of s containing r such that n r is essential in s r corollary 3 4 let r s be an integral m crucial fcp extension then s r s ms r s with equality if r s is quadratic proof set k r m let a a since r a is minimal we have m r a max r so that m s r s r let x s r s and set n r rx r x which gives mn r let x be the class of x in n r then n r rx but n r is also a one dimensional k vector space generated by x it follows by 18 corollary 2 page 66 that lr n r lk n r dimk n r 1 showing that n r is a simple r submodule of s r then x ms r s which leads to s r s ms r s assume in addition that r s is quadratic let x s be such that n r rx satisfies the following n r is a simple r submodule of s r since r s is quadratic it follows that n r s moreover the fact that n r is a simple r submodule of s r shows that there is no r submodule and a fortiori no r subalgebra of s strictly contained between r and n so that n a s r s this property holding for any r submodule n of s containing r such that n r is a simple r submodule we get that ms r s s r s with equality because of the first part remark 3 5 we use the example of remark 2 8 to show that in general the two socles of corollary 3 4 do not coincide let k l be a radicial fip extension of degree p 2 where c k p there exists a unique k k l such that k k p so that k is the unique 8 g picavet and m picavet atom of k l giving that k s k l but l k p 2 shows that there exists a basis x 1 1 xp 2 of the k vector space l with l p 2 i 1 kxi for i 1 set vi k kxi then each vi k is a simple subspace of l k and l ms k l 6 s r s k lemma 3 6 let r s be a distributive fcp extension hence fip and let s 1 be its socle then s 1 sup t r s r t boolean proof r s 1 is boolean because distributive and s 1 is a product of atoms of r s 1 28 page 292 let t r s be such that r t is boolean it follows from 26 theorem 3 1 that t a ba where b a and then t s 1 corollary 3 7 let r s be a distributive fcp extension hence fip then s r t s r s t holds for each t r s proof set s 1 s r s t 1 s r t and t 1 s 1 t because t 6 r there exists some a a such that r a t so r a s 1 t t 1 s 1 since r s 1 is boolean so is r t 1 by 26 proposition 3 11 then t 1 t 1 in view of lemma 3 6 but r t 1 being also boolean it follows that t 1 s 1 from t 1 t 1 t s 1 t 1 we infer that t 1 t 1 the loewy series of a distributive fcp extension provides a chain of boolean subextensions of this extension proposition 3 8 if r s is a distributive fcp extension hence fip and si ni 0 is its loewy series then si si 1 is boolean for each 0 i n 1 whence is either locally integral or locally pru fer moreover r s n 1 i 0 si si 1 proof by definition 3 1 3 for each i 0 n 1 si 1 s si s holds so that si si 1 is boolean by lemma 3 6 since r s has fcp the chain stops for some positive integer n such that sn s deny then there is some s which is an atom of sn s a contradiction for each i 0 n 1 si si 1 is either locally integral or locally pru fer 26 proposition 3 4 and corollary 3 19 since r s is distributive r s n 1 i 0 si si 1 by proposi tion 2 4 corollary 3 9 let r s be a distributive fcp extension hence fip and si ni 0 its loewy series then 1 r s r s if and only if r s is a chain in this case r s si ni 0 2 r s 1 if and only if r s is boolean loewy 9 proof assume that n r s proposition 3 8 implies n r s si si 1 1 for each i 0 n 1 si si 1 is minimal for each i 0 n 1 si s has only one atom which is si 1 for each i 0 n 1 we show by induction on i 0 n that if t r s is such that r t i then t si for i 0 obviously t r s 0 assume that the induction hypothesis holds for i 1 that is si 1 is the only element u of r s such that r u i 1 since r t i and r s is distributive and fcp any element t of r s such that t t is minimal satisfies r t i 1 so that t si 1 and si 1 t is minimal giving that t is an atom of si 1 s that is t si the induction holds for any i 0 n and r s si ni 0 is a chain the converse is immediate using the fact that si s has only one atom which is si 1 again by proposition 3 8 n 1 s s 1 r s is boolean example 3 10 let r s be an integrally closed fcp extension such that r is a local ring then 6 theorem 6 10 says that r s is a chain therefore distributive 26 proposition 2 3 and corollary 3 9 shows that r s si ni 0 proposition 3 11 let r s be an extension of length 2 the fol lowing conditions are equivalent 1 r s is a chain 2 r s 3 3 r s 2 if these conditions do not hold then r s 1 proof 1 2 obvious 3 1 by corollary 3 9 assume that these conditions do not hold then r s r s by proposition 3 2 leads to r s 1 recall that an extension r s is called pointwise minimal if r r x is minimal for each x s r these extensions were studied by cahen and the authors in 3 proposition 3 12 if r s is pointwise minimal then r s 1 proof any atom is a simple extension of r see 20 page 370 before lemma 1 2 conversely let x s r so that r r x is minimal and r x is an atom of r s then s x s rr x gives that s s r s s 1 and r s 1 in order to look at the behavior of loewy series under localizations we need the following lemma 10 g picavet and m picavet lemma 3 13 let r s be an fcp extension t u a subextension and m supp s r 1 if t u is minimal then either tm um is minimal or tm um 2 if tm um is minimal there exists v t s such that t v is minimal with vm um proof 1 is 10 lemme 1 3 2 assume that tm um is minimal let q c tm um msupptm um tm max tm there exists n spec t such that q nm in particular we have tm q um q minimal and tm p um p for each p spec tm p 6 q since tm q tm nm tn and um q um nm un by 1 proposition 7 page 85 implies that tn un is minimal then there exists some v t s such that t v is minimal with vn un um q vm q 26 lemma 3 3 it follows that vn tn for any n spec t n 6 n but gives for n spec t such that p n m where p 6 q that n 6 n so that tm p um p un vn vm p which leads to um vm to conclude if tm um is minimal there exists v t s such that t v is minimal with vm um proposition 3 14 let r s be an fcp extension with loewy series si ni 0 then 1 let i be an ideal shared by r and s then si i ni 0 is the loewy series of r i s i 2 letm supp s r and s i nm i 0 be the loewy series of rm sm then s i si m for each i 0 nm where nm inf i nn m 6 supp s si proof 1 let t u r s by 20 corollary 1 4 t u is minimal if and only if t i u i is minimal then an easy induction on i shows that the loewy series of r i s i is si i ni 0 2 let m supp s r we show by induction on i 0 nm that s i si m the induction hypothesis is satisfied for i 0 assume that it holds for i 0 nm 1 that is s i si m let a be an atom of si s so that si a is minimal then from lemma 3 13 we infer that either si m am is minimal or si m am so that am s i s i 1 it follows that si 1 m s i 1 now m 6 supp s si leads to s i si m sm s i 1 and i nm a contradiction so that m supp s si let b be an atom of si m sm so that si m s i b is minimal there exists some u si s such that b um with si m um minimal by lemma loewy 11 3 13 there exists b si s such that si b is minimal with bm um b so that b si 1 giving b bm si 1 m since s i 1 is the product of all atoms b of si m sm we get that s i 1 si 1 m to conclude s i 1 si 1 m and the induction hypothesis holds for i 1 as we have just seen before we get s i si m sm s i 1 as soon as m 6 supp s si so that nm inf i nn m 6 supp s si corollary 3 15 let r s be an fcp extension then r s sup rm sm m msupp s r proof letm supp s r and s i nm i 0 be the loewy series of rm sm set n r s we proved in proposition 3 14 that s i si m for each i 0 nm where nm rm sm inf i nn m 6 supp s si then for any m supp s r rm sm r s assume that for any m supp s r rm sm r s n it follows that s n 1 sn 1 m sm and hence sn 1 s contra dicting the definition of n then r s sup rm sm m msupp s r example 3 16 we use the example of remark 2 8 in order to exhibit a computation of nm in proposition 3 14 k l is a radicial fip field extension of degree p 2 and k is the only proper subalgebra of l set r k 2 r 1 k x x 2 k r 2 k k r 3 k l s k x x 2 l m 0 k and n k 0 then max r m n with m 6 n moreover k k x x 2 is a minimal ramified extension and s r 1 r 3 by 5 lemma iii 3 d r s r r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 r 3 s we have the following diagram where r

if and only if t k k k x x 2 k r 1 r 2 and then s 1 r 1 r 2 using again 5 proposition iii 4 we get that s 1 s is minimal so that s 2 s then n 2 now s 1 m r 1 m sm s 2 m so that nm 1 and s 1 n r 2 n 6 sn r 3 n s 2 n whence nn 2 let r s be an fcp extension and msupp s r m 1 mn consider the map r s n i 1 rmi smi defined by t 12 g picavet and m picavet tm 1 tmn then is injective 6 theorem 3 6 in 26 we called r s a b extension if is bijective b stands for bijective we proved in 26 proposition 2 20 that r s is a b extension if and only if r p is local for each p supp s r this condition holds in case supp s r max r and in particular if r s is integral the loewy series of such extensions have nice properties proposition 3 17 let r s be an fcp b extension for each m msupp s r set am a a c r a m then 1 s rm sm a am am 2 there exists a unique s 1 m r s such that s 1 m m s rm sm and s 1 m m rm for any m spec r m 6 m in particular s 1 m a am a 3 a m msupp s r am and s 1 m msupp s r s 1 m proof 1 s r s m s rm sm by proposition 3 14 it follows that s rm sm a aa m a aam let m msupp s r m 6 m and a am then c r a m implies a m rm so that s rm sm a am am 2 since r s is a b extension the bijective map r s n i 1 rmi smi shows that there exists a unique s 1 m r s such that s 1 m m s rm sm a am am and s 1 m m rm for any m spec r m 6 m moreover for a am we have am rm giving a am am rm so that s 1 m a am a 3 a m msupp s r am because for each a a we have c r a msupp s r which leads to s 1 a aa m msupp s r a am a m msupp s r s 1 m proposition 3 18 let r s be an integral arithmetic fcp extension with loewy series si ni 0 for each m msupp s r let rm i nm i 0 be the maximal chain of rm sm set am a a c r a m and m supm msupp s r rm sm then 1 for each m msupp s r am 1 let t 1 m be the unique element

r since rm sm is a chain rm 1 is its only atom from lemma 3 13 we deduce that there is t 1 m r s such that r t 1 m is minimal with t 1 m m rm 1 and t 1 m m rm for m msupp s r m 6 m since r s is integral it is a b extension by 26 proposition 2 20 so that t 1 m am is the only element of a satisfying then am t 1 m and am 1 2 proposition 3 17 yields that s r s m msupp s r a am a m msupp s r t 1 m 3 we proved in proposition 3 14 that for m supp s r and s i nm i 0 the loewy series of rm sm then s i si m for each i 0 nm where nm inf i nn m 6 supp s si in par ticular s i si m rm i let t be an atom of si 1 s and set m c si 1 t r msuppr s si 1 so that i nm and s i 1 tm is minimal moreover by minimality of si 1 t we get tm si 1 m for m msupp s r m 6 m since r s is a b extension it follows that t is unique for a given m and of the form ti m such that for each m m msupp s r m 6 m ti m m rm i if i nm and ti m m sm if i nm and ti m m rm moreover si m msupp s r ti m in particular r s supm msupp s r rm sm m by corollary 3 15 4 since r s is arithmetic it is distributive definition 2 6 so that r s n 1 i 0 si si 1 by proposition 3 8 but si si 1 is boolean so that si si 1 is the number of atoms of si si 1 by 26 theorem 3 1 in view of 3 they are gotten for each si si 1 by the elements of the chain rm sm which are of the form rm i 1 that is for i nm then si si 1 rm i 1 i nm giving r s m msupp s r nm 1 in corollary 3 9 we proved that if r s is a chain then r s si ni 0 we introduce the following property definition 3 19 an fcp extension r s with loewy series si ni 0 is said to satisfy the property p or is a p extension if r s n 1 i 0 si si 1 the loewy series gives a partition of r s here is an example of such a p extension example 3 20 in 25 example 5 17 2 we gave the following exam ple set k q l k x where x 3 2 and ki k i i 14 g picavet and m picavet 2 3 6 then k l k k 1 k 2 k 3 l and the following diagram holds l k 1 k 2 k 3 k so that k l is a non distributive extension of

be gotten for a dis tributive extension we begin to give two results for a non necessarily distributive p extension proposition 3 21 let r s be an fip extension with loewy series si ni 0 then r s n 1 i 0 si si 1 1 n with equality if and only if r s is a p extension proof since n 1 i 0 si si 1 r s we get that n 1 i 0 si si 1 r s but si ni 0 is an ascending chain so that si 1 si si si 1 si for each i nn 1 and sj sj 1 si si 1 for any i j such that j 6 i i 1 i 1 then n 1 i 0 si si 1 n 1 i 0 si si 1 1 n since there are n 1 elements si common to two distinct subsets sj sj 1 the equality holds if and only if n 1 i 0 si si 1 r s if and only if r s satisfies property p theorem 3 22 let r s be an fcp p extension with loewy series si ni 0 then r s is distributive if and only if si si 1 is boolean for each 0 i n 1 if these conditions hold then r s has fip proof one part of the proof is proposition 3 8 conversely assume that r s satisfies property p and that si si 1 boolean for each i n let t u v r s be such that ut v t and u t v t we claim that that u v this will prove that r s is distributive by 4 theorem 1 6 page 9 the result is obvious if s u v t then choose i j k 0 n 1 such that t si si 1 u sj sj 1 v sk sk 1 set l sup j 1 k 1 and l inf j k this yields that l l and sl u v sl consider the different cases 1 if i j k then u v because t u v si si 1 which is boolean and then distributive 2 assume i l so that u v sl si t then u u t v t v loewy 15 3 assume that i l so that i 1 l which implies t si 1 sl u v then u ut v t v 4 the last case to consider which has two subcases is when l i l there is no harm to assume j k in this case l j and l k 1 so that yields j i k if j i k we can take i k because of 1 and then i 1 k it follows that u t si 1 sk v then v v t ut and t t v t u leads to t u whence v ut u if j i k then by j 1 i we obtain u sj 1 si t which gives u t u v t si sk v so that si t v u a contradiction which shows that this case does not occur to conclude u v in each case and r s is distributive the last result holds since an fcp distributive extension has fip corollary 3 23 let r s be a distributive fcp hence fip p extension with loewy series si ni 0 and t r s there is some k 0 n 1 such that t sk sk 1 and then si ki 0 t is the loewy series of r t and t si ni k 1 is the loewy series of t s moreover r t and t s are p extensions proof since r s is a p extension there is some k 0 n 1 such that t sk sk 1 so that sk t sk 1 let ti mi 0 resp t i ri 0 be the loewy series of r t resp t s by definition of the socle of an extension we have obviously si ti for each i 0 k moreover sk sk 1 is boolean by proposition 3 8 which implies that t is a product of atoms of sk s 26 theorem 3 1 in fact t is a product of the atoms of sk s contained in t so that t is the product of atoms of sk t giving t s sk t then tk 1 t and m k 1 now t t 0 from 26 proposition 3 11 we deduce that t sk 1 is also boolean and sk 1 is the product of the atoms of t sk 1 we claim that sk 1 s t s deny so that there exists some atom a of t s which is not in t sk 1 but t a is a minimal extension since r s is a p extension we get that a n 1 i k 1 si si 1 and then t sk 1 a a contradiction then sk 1 t 1 and the other terms of the loewy series of t s are the si for i k 2 n the last property follows easily in the next result we use the radical r of an extension defini tion 3 1 2 corollary 3 24 let r s be a distributive fcp p extension hence fip with loewy series si ni 0 then si r si si 1 for each i 0 n 1 and sn 1 r r s 16 g picavet and m picavet proof in view of theorem 3 22 si si 1 is boolean for each i 0 n 1 then si r si si 1 for each i n 1 by de morgan s law 27 theorems 3 43 and 5 1 and the equivalences of 28 page 292 indeed since si si 1 is boolean si is the complement of si 1 now si 1 is the product of atoms of si si 1 which implies that si is the intersection of co atoms of si si 1 that is r si si 1 since r s is a p extension r s n 1 i 0 si si 1 let a ca there is some i 0 n 1 with a si si 1 whence a is comparable to any si but a s is minimal so that sn 1 a yields that a is a co atom of sn 1 s it follows that sn 1 a caa r r s r sn 1 s sn 1 by the first part of the proof proposition 2 5 says that when r s has fcp t r s is irreducible if and only if either t r or there is a unique t r s such that t t is minimal for an fcp distributive p extension these elements can be characterized thanks to the loewy series in fact the following theorem characterizes fcp distributive p extensions theorem 3 25 let r s be a distributive fcp hence fip exten sion with loewy series si ni 0 then r s is a p extension if and only if the following condition holds any t r s is irreducible in r s if and only if there exists some i n 1 such that t is an atom of si si 1 proof assume first r s is a p extension let t r s be irreducible in r s there is some i 0 n 1 such that t si si 1 which is boolean it follows that t is a product ofm atoms of si si 1 by 26 theorem 3 1 but t being irreducible in r s is a fortiori irreducible in si si 1 givingm 1 so that t is itself an atom of si si 1 conversely let t be an atom of some si si 1 we show that t is irreducible in r s deny and let u v r s t be such that t uv so that u v t si 1 because of property p there exist j k 0 n 1 such that u sj sj 1 and v sk sk 1 moreover implies that j k i we cannot have j k i since t is an atom of si si 1 assume that only one u v is in si si 1 for instance u si si 1 so that i j then v si u t leads to uv u t a contradiction for the remaining case j k i we have j 1 k 1 i and u v 6 si si 1 we get that uv si t again a contradiction then t is irreducible now we show that r s n 1 i 0 si si 1 if the following condition holds any t r s is irreducible if and only if there exists some i 0 n 1 such that t is an atom of si si 1 let u r s loewy 17 so that u m j 1 tj for some positive integer m where tj is irreducible for each j by 26 proposition 2 9 the hypothesis gives that for each j there exists a unique ij 0 n 1 such that tj is an atom of sij sij 1 set k sup ij j nm i 1 j nm ij k and i 2 j nm ij k in particular i 2 6 then for each h i 1 and for each l i 2 we have th sk tl sk 1 so that u h i 1 th l i 2 tl l i 2 tl then u sk sk 1 and property p holds the following definitions are needed for our study definition 3 26 an integral extension r s is called infra integral 19 resp subintegral 29 if all its residual extensions r p s q with q spec s and p q r are isomorphisms resp and the natural map spec s spec r is bijective an exten sion r s is called t closed cf 19 if the relations b s r r b 2 rb r b 3 rb 2 r imply b r the t closure tsr of r in s is the smallest element b r s such that b s is t closed and the greatest element b r s such that r b is infra integral an extension r s is called seminormal cf 29 if the relations b s b 2 r b 3 r imply b r the seminormalization sr of r in s is the smallest element b r s such that b s is seminormal and the greatest element b r s such that r b is subintegral the canonical decomposition of an arbitrary ring extension r s is r sr tsr r s next proposition describes the link between the elements of the canonical decomposition and minimal extensions proposition 3 27 25 proposition 4 5 let there be an integral exten sion r s and a maximal chain c of r subextensions of s defined by r r 0 ri rn s where each ri ri 1 is minimal the following statements hold 1 r s is subintegral if and only if each ri ri 1 is ramified 2 r s is seminormal and infra integral if and only if each ri ri 1 is decomposed 3 r s is t closed if and only if each ri ri 1 is inert if either 1 or 3 holds then spec s spec r is bijective example 3 28 we now give three examples of an fcp distributive hence fip and not boolean extension where property p holds or not 1 set g z 12 z which is a cyclic group and let k l be a cyclic extension with galois group g the proper subgroups of g 18 g picavet and m picavet are 2 g 3 g 4 g and 6 g so that the lattice g of subgroups of g is 0 2 g 3 g 4 g 6 g g which is distributive 27 exercise 15 page 125 using the order isomorphism of lattices g k l defined by h fix h we obtain the following lattice k l k fix ig l i 2 3 4 6 set li ig we have the following diagram l 2 l 4 k l 6 l l 3 then k l is distributive but does not satisfy property p indeed l 6 is the socle of k l because l 2 and l 3 are the atoms of k l with l 6 l minimal so that s 0 k s 1 l 6 and s 2 l moreover l 4 6 s 0 s 1 s 1 s 2 in particular we cannot apply corollary 3 24 indeed r k l l 4 l 6 6 s 1 l 6 this example shows that the results of theorem 3 22 hold even if property p is not satisfied since s 0 s 1 and s 1 s 2 are boolean this also shows that in a distributive extension a irreducible element is not necessarily an atom of some sj sj 1 see l 4 and an atom of some sj sj 1 is not necessarily irreducible see l 2 an obvious example of a distributive p extension r s is when r s is a chain 3 we give here a more involved example of a distributive p extension take k l a finite separable field extension of degree 6 such that k l is a boolean algebra with k l k l 1 l 2 l and k l 2 26 example 4 17 set s l x x 2 so that l s is a minimal ramified extension and s is a local ring with maximal ideal m set t tsk which is a local ring because k s is a finite integral ex tension then t s is t closed with m t s max t 7 lemma 3 17 since k s has fcp by 6 theorem 4 2 there exists a finite chain k r 0 rn rn 1 t such that ri ri 1 is minimal ramified for each i 0 n there are no decomposed minimal extension ri ri 1 because t is local set r rn and consider the extension r s since t m k and s m l we get that t s is a boolean extension by 26 proposition 3 4 5 with t s t t 1 t 2 s where ti is such that ti m li because of the bijection t s k l given by u 7 u m moreover r s 3 by 22 proposition 3 2 we claim that t is the only atom of the ex tension assume there exists some t r s t such that r t is minimal we get that r t can be neither decomposed as we already observed since s is local nor ramified because in this case we loewy 19 should have t t a contradiction if r t is minimal inert this leads also to a contradiction because t would not be the t closure since some minimal ramified extensions would start from t 9 propo sition 7 4 then t is the socle s 1 of the extension moreover s s 2 since t s is boolean consider some u r s and let v r u be such that r v is minimal as we already observed v t so that u t s s 1 s 2 which yields r s s 0 s 1 s 1 s 2 we have the following diagram t 1 r t s 1 s s 2 t 2 then r s is a p extension and r s is distributive by corollary 3 22 let r s be a ring extension we recall that r is called unbranched in s if r is local in this case if r s has fcp the following lemma shows that any t r s is local an extension r s is called quasi pru fer if r s is a pru fer extension that is r t is a flat epimorphism for each t r s 24 definition 2 1 an fcp extension is quasi pru fer 24 corollary 3 3 since an fcp integrally closed extension is pru fer 24 proposition 1 3 lemma 3 29 let r s be a quasi pru fer extension such that r is unbranched in s then t is local for each t r s in particular this holds if r s has fcp proof since r is local so is any element of r r let t r s so that r t r t is local since r s is quasi pru fer so is r t and t is local by 24 proposition 1 2 3 because r t t is pru fer as we saw in example 3 28 3 the t closure of the extension is the socle of the extension we are going to show that for some distributive extensions r s the t closure and the integral closure are elements of the loewy series proposition 3 30 let r s be an fcp distributive extension hence fip such that r is unbranched in s and si ni 0 its loewy series then there exist k l 0 n such that t r r sk and r sl moreover r t r r and r s are chains proof since r is a local ring so are r and si for any i nn 1 by lemma 3 29 let m be the maximal ideal of r 20 g picavet and m picavet since si is local and si si 1 is boolean fip it follows from 26 corollary 3 19 that si si 1 is either integral or pru fer assume that si si 1 is pru fer for some i 0 n 2 and let j i for j n we claim that sj sj 1 is pru fer deny so that si sj 1 is neither integral nor pru fer set s i si sj 1 then s i 6 si sj 1 it follows that there exist a minimal integral extension si t and a minimal pru fer extension si u with t u si sj 1 t s i u si 1 an application of 25 lemma 1 5 leads to c si t 6 c si u a contradiction since si is local then sj sj 1 is pru fer for any j i in particular as soon as some sk sk 1 pru fer so is si si 1 for each i k whence sk r now if r 6 r we can work with the extension r r which is also distributive and its loewy series is si ki 0 from 26 proposition 3 24 we deduce that si si 1 is either infra integral more precisely subintegral since si 1 is local or t closed for each i k since si is local in order to establish the result for the t closure we mimic the previous proof given for the integral closure assume that si si 1 is t closed and let j i for j k we claim that sj sj 1 is t closed deny so that si sj 1 is neither infra integral nor t closed set s i t sj 1 si then s i 6 si sj 1 it follows that there exist a minimal ramified extension si t and a minimal inert extension si u with t u si sj 1 t s i u si 1 then 9 proposition 7 4 shows that there are two maximal chains in si tu of different lengths contradicting the distributivity of r s by proposition 2 4 then sj sj 1 is t closed for any j such that k j i in particular as soon as sl sl 1 is t closed so is si si 1 for each i l giving sl t r r since r is a local ring and r sl is subintegral so is si si 1 for each i l and then is minimal ramified by 26 lemma 3 26 in particular each si si 1 has only one atom which is si 1 let t r sl since r t has fcp there is a tower r ti t where ti ri 0 is the loewy series of r t since r s 0 t 0 an obvious induction shows that ti si for all i r and t sr for some r l so that r t r r is a chain by 6 theorem 6 10 r s is a chain remark 3 31 example 3 16 shows that the conclusion of proposition 3 30 does not hold in general in this example r is not local although r s is spectrally injective and tsr r 1 6 si for i 1 2 because r r 1 is minimal ramified and r 1 s is t closed a more precise study will be made in a forthcoming paper loewy 21 when an fcp distributive extension satisfies property p the loewy series allows to give information about the extension proposition 3 32 let r s be an fcp distributive hence fip p extension and si ni 0 its loewy series so that each si si 1 is boolean then 1 there exist j k 0 n with j k such that t r r sj sj 1 and r sk sk 1 2 let i 0 n 1 if i j si si 1 is infra integral if j i k si si 1 is t closed if i k si si 1 is pru fer 3 for i 0 n 1 let ai be the set of atoms of si si 1 then r s n 1 i 0 ai proof each si si 1 is boolean because of proposition 3 8 1 since r s n 1 i 0 si si 1 there exist j k 0 n such that t r r sj sj 1 and r sk sk 1 moreover j k since sj t r r r sk 1 implies j k 1 2 let i k so that i 1 k which implies si si 1 sk r then si si 1 is integral if i j then si si 1 sj trr and si si 1 is infra integral if j i k then j 1 i so that t r r sj 1 si si 1 sk r and si si 1 is t closed let i k so that i k 1 which implies r sk 1 si si 1 then si si 1 is pru fer 3 by 16 lemma 4 p 486 we get that r s is the number of irreducible elements of r s then theorem 3 25 gives the result we end this section by studying the loewy series of some special extensions we need the following lemma used in the next proposition lemma 3 33 21 lemma 2 9 and the paragraph before proposition 2 3 an fcp extension r s with a factorization r t s such that suppr t r suppr s t admits a unique factorization r u s such that t u r and tu s u is the complement of t in r s moreover suppr u r suppr s t and suppr s u suppr t r proposition 3 34 let r s be an fcp extension with loewy series si ni 0 and t r s such that suppr t r suppr s t then 1 t has a unique complement u r s 2 let ti mi 0 resp ui ri 0 be the loewy series of r t resp of r u then si tiui for each i 0 n with n r s sup r t r u sup m r 22 g picavet and m picavet proof 1 lemma 3 33 gives t u r and tu s moreover u is unique satisfying these properties 2 set m msuppr s r mt msuppr t r and mu msuppr u r msuppr s t then m mt mu with mt mu by lemma 3 33 now we use proposition 3 14 let m m and s i nm i 0 resp t i mm i 0 u i rm i 0 be the loewy se ries of rm sm resp rm tm rm um then s i si m for each i 0 nm t i ti m for each i 0 mm and u i ui m for each i 0 rm in view of we have ei ther m mt a or m mu b in case a m 6 mu so that um rm and tm sm it follows that nm mm and s i t i for each i nm moreover u i rm for each i nm so that s i t iu i si m ti m ui m tiui m the same reasoning shows that in case b nm rm and si m ti m ui m tiui m so that si m tiui m for anym msuppr s r from corollary 3 15 we deduce that n supm m nm sup supm mt nm supm mu nm sup supm mt mm supm mu rm sup m r if m r then n m r let i n then si m ti m ui m for each m m leads to si tiui if m 6 r assume m r so that n r as above si tiui t s for each i m recall that ti t for each i m r in particular sm tmum tum t s and we still have si tiui t s for each i m moreover msuppr s si msuppr s t mu for each i m in 24 definition 4 1 we call an extension r s almost pru fer if it can be factored r u s where r u is pru fer and u s is integral actually u is the pru fer hull r of the extension corollary 3 35 let r s be an fcp almost pru fer extension with loewy series si ni 0 let ti mi 0 resp ui ri 0 be the loewy series of r r resp of r r then si tiui for each i 0 n with n r s sup r r r r sup m r proof we have suppr r r suppr s r 24 proposition 4 16 with r the unique u r s such that r u r and u s then proposition 3 34 gives the result given a ring r recall that its nagata ring r x is the localization r x t 1 r x of the ring of polynomials r x with respect to the multiplicatively closed subset t of all polynomials with content r in 8 theorem 32 dobbs and the authors proved that when r s is an extension whose nagata extension r x s x has fip the loewy 23 map r s r x s x defined by t t x is an order isomorphism we show now that this map send the loewy series of r s to the loewy series of r x s x proposition 3 36 let r s be an extension such that r x s x has fip if si ni 0 is the loewy series of r s then si x ni 0 is the loewy series of r x s x in particular r s r x s x proof since the map r s r x s x defined by t t x is an order isomorphism it is also a lattice isomorphism in particular if t u r s is such that t u is minimal so is t x u x 7 theorem 3 4 let s i mi 0 be the loewy series of r x s x then an obvious induction on i shows that s i si x for each i 0 n since an atom a of si s gives the atom a x of si x s x and all atoms of si x s x are of this form in particular n r s m r x s x remark 3 37 if r s is an fcp extension such that r x s x is distributive then r x s x has fip because it has fcp by 7 theorem 3 9 in this case r s is distributive 26 proposition 3 6 and then has fip in corollary 3 4 and in remark 3 5 we proved that for a ring ex tension r s the two socles s r s and ms r s may differ using idealization we may associate to some modules a ring extension the loewy length of some modules can be computed as the loewy length of a ring extension let m be an r module the loewy length of the r module m is denoted by m we consider the ring extension r r m where r m is the idealization of m in r recall that r m r m r m r m is a commutative ring whose operations are defined as follows r m s n r s m n and r m s n rs rn sm then 1 0 is the unit of r m and r r m is a ring mor phism defining r m as an r module so that we can identify any r r with r 0 proposition 3 38 let m be an r module with finite length and let s r m be the idealization of m let si ni 0 be the loewy series of the ring extension r s then si r mi for each i 0 n where mi ni 0 is the loewy series of the lattice m in particular r s m proof since m is an r module with finite length r r m is an fcp quadratic extension 23 propositions 2 2 and 2 3 and 14 lemma 2 moreover there is an order isomorphism m 24 g picavet and m picavet r r m given by n r n in particular for n n m such that n n 23 proposition 2 8 says that r n r n is minimal if and only if n n is a simple r module at last for n n m obviously r n r n r n n so that is also a lattice isomorphism let si m 0 be the loewy series of r r m then an easy induction on i shows that si r mi for each i 0 n where mi ni 0 is the loewy series of the lattice m indeed an atom n of m mi is of the form n mi where n m and mi n and gives the atom r n of r mi r m moreover all atoms of r mi r m are of this form in particular r s m 4 finite distributive field extension we first consider a finite field extension k l with separable closure t and radicial closure u the loewy series of k l is linked to those of k t and k u if k l is a radicial extension then c k is a prime number we recall that a minimal field extension is either radicial or separable 20 remark before proposition 2 2 page 371 if k is an atom of k l then k k is either radicial or separable in the first case we say that k is a radicial atom and in this case k k p c k in the second case k is a separable atom if k l is a finite field extension which is not separable let t be its separable closure so that t l is a radicial extension in particular p c t is a prime number so that c k p since a finite dimensional separable field extension has fip we consider in this section mainly fip field extension we found less results for fcp not fip field extensions we begin with the following lemma lemma 4 1 let k l be an fcp field extension with separable closure t radicial closure u such that t u 6 k l let t k t and u k u set k t u then 1 u k is separable and t k is radicial 2 if there exists u k u such that u is a radicial atom of u u then ku is a radicial atom of k l moreover if k l has fip then ku is the only radicial atom of k l 3 the separable atoms v of k l are of the form v kt where t is an atom of t t in particular t v t proof since k u is radicial p c k is a prime number 1 obvious because t resp u is generated by a separable ele ment resp radicial elements over k which implies that this element generates a separable resp these elements generate a radicial exten sion u k u t resp t k u t loewy 25 2 for the same reason k ku is radicial and of degree p since u u p in particular ku is a radicial atom of k l moreover assume that k l has fip then ku is the unique radicial atom of k l deny and let w k l w 6 ku be a radicial atom of k l then k u w is a finite radicial extension which is not a chain a contradiction it follows that ku is the only radicial atom of k l 3 let v be a separable atom of k l we have the following diagram u k v l k t v t t where v t is the separable closure of t v in particular v t v is radicial with v t 6 t because t v is not radicial and v t 6 v because t v is not separable we claim that v is of the form kt where t is an atom of t t since v t t t there is some t t v t such that t t is minimal then t t v t implies k u t u t u v t v but k v minimal implies that either u t k or u t v in case we have t t k with t k radicial so that t t is both radicial and separable a contradiction so only case holds and v u t u v t u t t kt because t t in particular t v t as the separable closure of t v because t u t v is radicial conversely an atom t of t t is such that t t is minimal separable the inclusion t t leads to k u t u t separable with t u t radicial and k 6 u t by a similar reasoning as before in particular t u t t as the separable closure of t u t assume that k u t is not minimal so that there exists v k u t with k v separable then t k t v t u t t t as above v t 6 t because t v is not radicial which leads to v t t and then to u t u v t v a contradiction then k u t is minimal definition 4 2 11 a finite field extension k l is said to be excep tional if k lr and ls 6 l proposition 4 3 let k l be an fip field extension with separable closure t radicial closure u and t u 6 k l let si ni 0 resp ti mi 0 ui ri 0 ti si m be the loewy series of k l resp k t k u t l then 1 if i inf m r then si tiui 26 g picavet and m picavet 2 if m r then si ti m for i m in particular k l n s m 3 if r m and u l is separable then u is the complement of t moreover si urti uti for i r m with l sn ts utn in particular k l n m k t and s k t k u m r 4 assume that r m and u l is not separable for i r the si s are gotten by induction on i in the following way if si l is exceptional then si 1 siti 1 if si l is not exceptional then si 1 viti 1 where vi is the unique radicial atom of si l in this way we obtain the family si ti r for the least t such that st tm l as there exists some l such that st tl then si tl i t for i t in particular n s t l proof set p c k 1 we show by induction on i that si tiui for any i inf m r for i 0 we have k s 0 t 0 u 0 t 0 u 0 assume that for some i inf m r we have si tiui we are going to determine the atoms of si l since any minimal field extension is either radicial or separable it is enough to characterize any v si l which is either a radicial atom or a separable atom we use lemma 4 1 in case v siui 1 since ui 1 is the only radicial atom of ui l in case v sit where t is any atom of ti t because si 1 is the product of all atoms of si l we get that si 1 siui 1 ti 1 but si tiui with ti ti 1 and ui ui 1 leads to si 1 ui 1 ti 1 and the induction is proved 2 assume that m r in view of 1 we have sm tmum tum with sm l radicial indeed tm l is radicial and then a chain and sm tm l ti si m we have the following diagram um k tmum l tm with k um tm tmum both radicial and k tm um tmum both separable in particular um k tmum tm p m since ui 1 is a radicial atom of ui l for each i 0 m 1 it follows that tmum sm t 2 m and si tm i for any i m n so that m n s because s sn ts tm n 3 assume that m r so that sr trur utr let v be an atom of sr l if v is a separable atom of sr l then v srt where t is an atom of tr t in view of lemma 4 1 in particular loewy 27 srtr 1 urtrtr 1 urtr 1 is the product of the separable atoms of sr l since u l is separable there is no radicial atom in sr l it follows that sr 1 urtr 1 an obvious induction shows that si urti for any i r m since tu t l u l we get l tu therefore u is a complement of t because k t u which is obviously unique moreover t tm urtm and u ur urtm so that l urtm sm sn ts utn since u l is separable and t l is radicial then n m moreover s m r since l t u k pr ps m 4 assume that r m and that u l is not separable we have sr urtr by 1 we get by induction on i r the si s in the following way assume that si is gotten if si l is exceptional there is no v si l such that si v is minimal radicial then si 1 siti 1 as in case 3 if si l is not exceptional there is a unique radicial atom vi of si l but in this case since siti 1 is the product of separable atoms of si l then si 1 siti 1 vi viti 1 because si vi since si ni r is an increasing sequence there is a least t r such that st tm l indeed tm sm and there exists some l m such that st tl because tm l ti si m then si tl i t for i t which implies that s l n t that is n s t l proposition 4 4 let k l be an fcp radicial field extension set p c k and l k pn 1 then s k l x l xp k 2 if k l has fip the loewy series of k l is k l and k l n proof 1 s k l a aa where a is the set of atoms of k l now a a k a is minimal a k x with k k x minimal radicial k x k p a k x with xp k in particular tp k for any t a since c k p let y s k l then y is a finite sum of products z x 1 xn of elements of atoms of k l but zp xp 1 xpn k which yields that yp k then s k l x l xp k conversely if xp k for some x l k it follows that k k x is minimal so that k x a which leads to x s k l then s k l x l xp k 2 obvious since k l is a chain remark 4 5 contrary to fcp separable field extensions which are always fip there exist fcp radicial field extensions which are not fip take for instance k z 2 z y t the field of rational functions over z 2 z in two indeterminates y and t let y resp t be the class of y resp t in k and let resp be a zero of f x x 2 y resp g x x 2 t then k k is an fcp radicial extension of 28 g picavet and m picavet length 2 but it has not fip by 25 theorem 6 1 8 a because k k 4 gives k k actually the following proposition gives a characterization of fip radicial field extensions proposition 4 6 let k l be an fcp radicial field extension the following conditions are equivalent 1 k l is a chain 2 k l is distributive 3 k l has fip proof 1 2 by 26 proposition 2 3 1 3 since k l has fcp 3 1 by 26 lemma 4 1 2 1 assume that k l is distributive and not a chain there exist k 1 k 2 k 3 k l such that k 1 ki is minimal for i 2 3 with k 2 6 k 3 we get that k 1 k 2 k 3 4 because k 1 k 2 k 3 2 indeed k l is distributive so that k 1 k 2 k 3 does not contain a diamond 12 theorem 1 page 59 a contradiction with 25 theorem 6 1 8 a the last case to consider is the case of a finite separable field exten sion we recall here some results gotten in 26 let l k x be a finite separable whence fip field extension of k and f x ku x the set of monic polynomials of k x the minimal polynomial of x over k if g x lu x divides f x we denote by kg the k subalgebra of l generated by the coefficients of g for any k k l we denote by fk x ku x the minimal polynomial of x over k the proof of the primitive element theorem shows that k kfk of course fk x divides f x in k x and in l x we set d fk k k l then d is a poset for the order defined as follows if fk fk d then fk fk if and only if fk divides fk in l x which is equivalent to k k by 26 lemma 4 7 in particular inf is gcd in d corollary 4 7 26 corollary 4 9 the map k l d defined by k 7 fk is a reversing order bijection such that fkk inf fk fk for k k k l proposition 4 8 let k l k x be a finite separable field extension of k and k k a subextension then k k is minimal if and only if fk is a maximal proper divisor of fk in d proof in view of corollary 4 7 we have k k if and only if fk divides fk in d moreover k k is minimal if and only if there is loewy 29 no k k l such that k k k if and only if there is no proper divisor of fk divided strictly by fk if and only if fk is a maximal proper divisor of fk in d proposition 4 9 let k l k x be a finite separable field extension of k the loewy series si ni 0 of k l is gotten by induction in the following way s 0 k and for i 0 n 1 we have si 1 kg where g inf h d h is a maximal proper divisor of fsi in d proof for a given si we have si 1 v si v minimal in view of proposition 4 8 si v is minimal fv is a maximal proper divisor of fsi it follows from corollary 4 7 that si 1 kg g fsi 1 inf h d h is a maximal proper divisor of fsi proposition 4 10 let k l k x be a minimal separable field extension let n be the normal closure of l then k n 1 moreover the following conditions are equivalent 1 k n is distributive 2 k n is boolean 3 k n is a cyclic extension and n k is square free proof let g be the galois group of k n then n k x g g k x since k k x is obviously minimal for any g it follows that n s k n so that k n 1 1 2 by lemma 3 6 and by definition of a boolean extension 2 3 by 26 theorem 4 19 corollary 4 11 let k l be a finite galois extension with galois group g the socle s k l is globally invariant by the elements of g moreover k s k l is galois proof by definition s k l a aa for any a a there exists xa a such that a k xa so that s k l a a k xa for any g we have s k l a a k xa a a k xa obviously k xa a which yields s k l s k l but being a k isomorphism for any x l such that k x a and setting y 1 x that is x y we have k x k y with k y a to conclude s k l s k l and s k l s k l this equality shows that k s k l is galois by 2 proposition 5 page a v 54 we give here a complete study of the case of finite galois distributive field extensions they are evidently fip recall that a finite galois field extension is minimal if and only if its degree is a prime integer 20 proposition 2 2 and is boolean if and only if it is a cyclic extension with a square free degree 26 theorem 4 19 30 g picavet and m picavet proposition 4 12 a finite galois field extension is distributive if and only if it is cyclic proof let k l be a finite galois field extension with galois group g and let g be the set of subgroups of g in view of the funda mental theorem of galois theory the maps k l g defined by k autk l the group of k automorphisms of l for each k k l and g k l defined by h fix h the fixed field of h in l for each h g are reversing order isomorphisms of lattices with 1 see 2 corollaire 2 page a v 65 it follows that k l is distributive if and only if g is distributive if and only if g is cyclic 13 theorem 19 2 1 theorem 4 13 let k l be a finite cyclic field extension set r l k m i 1 p i i where the pi are distinct prime integers let dr be the set of divisors of r and a be the set of atoms of k l then 1 for each i nm there is a unique ai a such that ai k pi let t k l then t a if and only if t k pi for some i nm 2 s k l m i 1 ai 3 set sup i i nm let sj nj 0 be the loewy series of k l and let j 0 n then sj k m i 1 p i i where either i i if i j or i j if i j moreover t k l is an atom of sj sj 1 if and only if t k m i 1 p i i where there exists a unique i 0 such that i 0 i 0 satisfying i i for each i 6 i 0 and i 0 i 0 1 in particular n 4 sj sj 1 is boolean for each j 0 n 1 5 let t k l then t is a irreducible element of k l if and only if t k p i i for some i n i and some i nm 6 k l d l k m i 1 i 1 dr let aj be the set of atoms of sj sj 1 then k l 1 j 0 aj m i 1 i which is the number of irreducible elements of k l 7 the following conditions are equivalent a k l is a p extension b k l is either boolean or a chain c either m 1 or 1 proof first observe that any subextension of k l is still cyclic and k l is galois distributive moreover there is a lattice isomorphism dr k l where d 7 t such that t k d 1 let g be the galois group of k l then g z rz with g r since k l is cyclic it follows that for any integer d dr there exists a unique t k l such that t k d and conversely loewy 31 t k dr for any t k l in particular k t is minimal if and only if t k is a prime integer then t a if and only if t k pi for some i nm and for each i nm there is a unique ai a such that ai k pi 2 by definition s k l a aa m i 1 ai 3 we show by induction on j 0 that sj k m i 1 p i i where either i i if i j or i j if i j the induction hypothesis holds clearly for j 0 assume that the induction hypothesis holds for some j 0 n 1 so that sj l then sj k m i 1 p i i where either i i if i j or i j if i j set mj i nm i j there is no harm to renumber the i s so that i j for each i mj and i j for each i mj let t be an atom of sj sj 1 so that sj t is minimal and t sj pi 0 for some i 0 nm in particular t k p i 0 1 i 0 i 6 i 0 p i i so that i 0 1 i 0 which leads to i 0 i 0 then i 0 j that is i 0 j and i 0 mj conversely if i mj then i j so that there exists t sj l such that t sj pi and t is an atom of sj l since sj 1 is the product of all atoms of sj l it follows that sj 1 sj mj i 1 pi giving sj 1 k sj 1 sj sj k mj i 1 pi m i mj 1 p i i mj i 1 p i i m i 1 p i i where i i 1 if i mj and i i for i mj this means the following if i j 1 j then i i 1 j 1 if i j then i i i and if i j then i i j i hence the induction hypothesis holds for sj 1 in particular l s sn and n 4 sj sj 1 is boolean for each j 0 n 1 by proposition 3 8 since k l is distributive in particular we recover the fact that sj 1 sj is square free for each j 0 n 1 5 let t k l be such that t k p ii for some i n i and some i nm it follows that k t is a chain since so is the galois group of k t isomorphic to z p ii z then t is irreducible by proposition 2 5 assume now that t k is divided by at least two distinct prime integers after a suitable reordering we may assume that t k r i 1 p i i r 1 and i 0 for each i nr in view of the fundamental theorem of galois theory there exist t 1 t 2 k t such that t ti pi for i 1 2 so that t 1 t and t 2 t are two minimal field extensions as it is recalled before proposition 4 12 then t is not irreducible by proposition 2 5 32 g picavet and m picavet 6 the equality k l d l k is obvious because of the lattice isomorphism recalled at the beginning of the proof by 16 lemma 4 p 486 k l is the number of irreducible elements of k l then k l m i 1 i by 5 to end k l 1 j 0 sj sj 1 by propo sition 3 8 but each sj sj 1 is boolean so that sj sj 1 aj by 26 theorem 3 1 this yields k l 1 j 0 aj we can remark that we may consider k l in two different ways when we write k l 1 1 1 2 1 m a 0 aj in line i we have the power of pi in l k which is the number of irreducible elements whose degree of extension over k is a power of pi and in column j we have the number of atoms of sj sj 1 with either 1 or 0 instead of and 0 after and under each 0 7 we discuss with respect to m and if m 1 then k l is a chain and a p extension by corollary 3 9 assume m 1 if 1 then l k m i 1 pi shows that k l is boolean by the remark before proposition 4 12 because its degree is square free and then a p extension since k l k s 1 assume that 1 after reordering we may assume that 1 1 there exists t k l such that t k p 21 since s 1 k m i 1 pi by 3 we get that t 6 k s 1 s 1 l so that k l 6 n 1 i 0 si si 1 and k l is not a p extension in this case in particular k l is neither boolean nor a chain gathering the different cases we get 7 remark 4 14 comparing theorem 3 22 and theorem 4 13 4 we see that the latter is a generalization of theorem 3 22 in case of a finite cyclic field extension indeed k l is distributive and sj sj 1 is boolean for each j 0 n 1 whatever k l is a p extension or not references 1 n bourbaki alge bre commutative chs 1 2 hermann paris 1961 2
