stable under the formation of sums the so called extensions an integrally closed extension has the property if and only it is a pru fer extension we then give characterizations of fcp extensions using the fact that for fcp extensions it is enough to consider integral fcp extensions we are able to give substantial results in particular our work can be applied to extensions of number field orders because they have the fcp property 1 introduction and notation in this paper we work inside the category of commutative and unital rings whose epimorphisms will be involved if r s is a ring extension r s denote the set of all r subalgebras of s an extension r s is said to have fcp or is called an fcp extension if the poset r s is both artinian and noetherian which is equivalent to each chain in r s is finite the so called extensions have been the subject of many papers the seminal paper on the subject was authored by gilmer and huckaba 13 a ring extension r s is called a extension if t u r s for each t u r s i e t u tu 13 definition page 414 although the notion of extensions originates in commutative algebra the lattice properties of r s associated to an extension r s bring a new point of view to their theory we will explain what we are aiming to show about them in some contexts that have not been considered yet we consider lattices of the following form for an extension r s the poset r s is a complete lattice where the supremum of any non void subset is the compositum of its elements which we call product 2010 mathematics subject classification primary 13 b 02 13 b 21 13 b 22 06 e

rule an extension r s is said to have some property of lattices if r s has this property we use lattice definitions and properties described in 16 any undefined material is explained at the end of the section or in the next sections a representative example of the use of lattices is given by the follow ing result a catenarian i e verifying the jordan ho lder condition integral fcp extension r s with t closure t is a extension if and only if r t and t s are extensions note also that an infra integral integral with isomorphic residual field extensions fcp extension has the property if and only if it is modular in case we are dealing with an integrally closed extension a char acterization is immediately given as follows such extensions are extensions if and only if they are pru fer extensions defined by knebush and zhang 14 or equivalently they are normal pairs this result is often reproved by authors working in some particular contexts we mainly consider fcp extensions the fcp condition allows us to prove results by induction fcp extensions are of the form r r s where r is the integral closure of r in s and r s is pru fer 22 proposition 1 3 we show that these extensions are extensions if and only if r r is a extension theorem 4 5 therefore we need only to consider integral fcp extensions inter esting examples of integral fcp extensions are given by extensions of number field orders we exhibit examples of such extensions show ing that everything is possible note also that an extension r r t where t is either idempotent or nilpotent of index 2 and such that r is a spir is a extension section 2 is devoted to some recalls and results on ring extensions and their lattice properties the general properties of extensions are given in section 3 in section 4 the main result is theorem 4 28 where we give a char acterization of extensions using the canonical decomposition of an integral extension r s through the seminormalization and the t closure of r in s actually the property of r s is equivalent to the property of all the paths of the canonical decomposition plus an extra lattice condition relative to some b 2 subextensions the case of infra integral extensions is specially considered while length two extensions are strongly involved for example an infra integral fcp extension of length two is a extension extensions 3 the paper ends in section 5 with examples of extensions in particular we consider boolean extensions pointwise minimal exten sions extensions of the form r rn these special cases allow to characterize more generally some extensions we denote by r s the conductor of r s and by r the integral closure of r in s we set r s r s r s with a similar definition for r s or r s the extension r s is said to have fip for the finitely many intermediate algebras property or is an fip extension if r s is finite a chain of r subalgebras of s is a set of elements of r s that are pairwise comparable with respect to inclusion we will say that r s is chained if r s is a chain we also say that the extension r s has fcp resp fmc or is an fcp resp fmc extension if each chain in r s is finite resp there exists a maximal finite chain clearly each extension that satisfies fip must also satisfy fcp and each extension that satisfies fcp must also satisfy fmc dobbs and the authors characterized fcp and fip extensions 6 our principal tool are the minimal ring extensions a concept that was introduced by ferrand olivier 11 in our context minimal exten sions coincide with lattice atoms they are completely known see section 2 recall that an extension r s is called minimal if r s r s the key connection between the above ideas is that if r s has fcp then any maximal necessarily finite chain c of r subalgebras of s r r 0 r 1 rn 1 rn s with length c n results from juxtaposing n minimal extensions ri ri 1 0 i n 1 an fcp extension is finitely generated and module finite if integral for an fcp extension r s the length r s of r s is the supremum of the lengths of chains of r subalgebras of s notice that this length is finite and there does exist some maximal chain of r subalgebras of s with length r s 7 theorem 4 11 the characteristic of a field k is denoted by c k finally x is the cardinality of a set x denotes proper inclusion and for a positive integer n we set nn 1 n 2 recalls and results on ring extensions this section is devoted to two types of recalls commutative rings and lattices 2 1 rings and ring extensions a local ring is here what is called elsewhere a quasi local ring as usual spec r and max r are the set of prime and maximal ideals of a ring r for an extension r s 4 g picavet and m picavet and an ideal i of r we write vs i p spec s i p the support of an r module e is suppr e p spec r ep 6 0 and msuppr e suppr e max r note that if r s is an fmc or fcp extension then suppr s r 6 corollary 3 2 if e is an r module lr e also denoted l e is its length as a module if r s is a ring extension and p spec r then sp is both the localization sr p as a ring and the localization at p of the r module s we denote by r p the residual field rp prp at p the following notions and results are deeply involved in the sequel definition 2 1 3 definition 2 10 an extension r s is called m crucial if supp s r m such m is called the crucial maximal ideal c r s of r s theorem 2 2 11 the ore me 2 2 a minimal extension r s is ei ther integral module finite or a flat epimorphism and supp s r 1 moreover if supp s r m then m is the crucial maximal ideal of r s such that rp sp for all p spec r m recall that an extension r s is called pru fer if r t is a flat epimorphism for each t r s or equivalently if r s is a normal pair 14 theorem 5 2 page 47 in 22 we called an extension which is a minimal flat epimorphism a pru fer minimal extension three types of minimal integral extensions exist characterized in the next theorem a consequence of the fundamental lemma of ferrand olivier so that there are four types of minimal extensions mutually exclusive theorem 2 3 6 theorems 2 2 and 2 3 let r t be an extension and m r t then r t is minimal and finite if and only if m max r and one of the following three conditions holds inert case m max t and r m t m is a minimal field exten sion decomposed case there exist m 1 m 2 max t such that m m 1 m 2 and the natural maps r m t m 1 and r m t m 2 are both isomorphisms or equivalently there exists q t r such that t r q q 2 q m and mq m ramified case there exists m max t such that m 2 m m t m r m 2 and the natural map r m t m is an isomorphism or equivalently there exists q t r such that t r q q 2 m and mq m in each of the above cases m c r t the crucial ideals of minimal subextensions of an fcp extension give many useful properties as we can see in the following extensions 5 lemma 2 4 23 lemma 1 5 let r s be an extension and t u r s such that r t is finite minimal and r u is pru fer minimal then c r t 6 c r u so that r is not a local ring lemma 2 5 crosswise exchange 6 lemma 2 7 let r s and s t be minimal extensions m c r s n c s t and p n r be such that p 6 m then there is s r t such that r s is minimal of the same type as s t and p c r s and s t is minimal of the same type as r s with ms c s t moreover r t r s s t and rq sq s q tq for q max r m p 2 2 some special ring extensions let r s be an extension and c ti i nn r s n 1 be a finite chain we say that r s is pinched at c if r s ni 0 ti ti 1 where t 0 r and tn 1 s which means that any element of r s is comparable to the ti s if r s is an extension we say that r is unbranched in s if r is local we also say that r s is unbranched if r s is unbranched and fcp then each t r s is a local ring 25 lemma 3 29 an extension r s is said locally unbranched if rm sm is unbranched for all m msupp s r in particular for an fcp extension r s this is equivalent to spec r spec r is bijective an extension is said branched if it is not unbranched an extension r s is said almost unbranched if each t r r is a local ring then unbranched implies almost unbranched remark 2 6 let r s be a ring extension and t r s then it is easily seen that t r resp tr is the integral closure of r in t resp of t in s similar relations exist for the t closure and the seninormalization we warn the reader that these properties will be often used in this paper corollary 2 7 an fcp almost unbranched extension is pinched at r proof assume that r s is not pinched at r so that there exists t r s r r r s set u t r r r since r s is almost unbranched and fcp then u is a local ring when u 6 r that is t 6 r s which is satisfied because t 6 r r it follows that u 6 t then there exist v u t and w u r such that u v is minimal pru fer and u w is minimal integral a contradiction by lemma 2 4 proposition 2 8 let r s be an fcp extension such that r 6 r s then r s is pinched at r if and only if for any u r s such that u r is minimal then msuppr s r vr u r 6 g picavet and m picavet proof assume that r s is pinched at r so that r s r r r s let u r s be such that u r is minimal and set p u r max u letm msuppr s r according to 23 lemma 1 8 there exists v r s such that r v is minimal pru fer with m c r v if m u 6 p by the crosswise exchange there exists t r s such that u t is minimal pru fer so that t 6 r r then t r s a contradiction with u r t and u t minimal then m u p and more precisely m u p because m max r and u r is integral to conclude p m that is m vr u r conversely assume that msuppr s r vr u r for any u r s such that u r is minimal supppose that r s 6 r r r s and let t r s r r r s set u t r r because u r implies t r s we also have u 6 t because u t implies t r r then there exist u 1 u r and t 1 u t such that u u 1 is minimal integral and u t 1 is minimal pru fer by lemma 2 4 we have c u u 1 6 c u t 1 it follows from 9 proposition 7 10 that u 1 u 1 t 1 is minimal pru fer and t 1 t 1 u 1 is minimal integral with c u 1 u 1 t 1 6 msuppu 1 r u 1 of course u 1 t 1 6 r r because t 1 u u 1 t 1 if t 1 u 1 r s then u 1 r t 1 u 1 implies u 1 r so that u r is minimal if t 1 u 1 6 r s then t 1 r s r r r s it follows that we get u 1 u 1 t 1 r because u 1 is the integral closure of u u 1 t 1 since u 1 r u r an easy induction shows that there exists a maximal finite chain ui ni 0 such that u 0 u un r with t 1 ui 6 r r r s for each i 0 n 1 we have the following commutative diagram t s t 1 t 1 u 1 t 1 un 1 t 1 r u u 1 un 1 r then in both cases we get that un 1 r is minimal integral with un 1 t 1 un 1 minimal pru fer as r t 1 r so that t 1 r r s we still have c un 1 un 1 t 1 6 c un 1 r with c r rt 1 un 1 c un 1 un 1 t 1 6 c un 1 r un 1 r but m c r rt 1 msuppr s r gives by assumption that un 1 r m so that m un 1 un 1 r because un 1 r max un 1 a contradiction extensions 7 with which is m un 1 6 un 1 r hence r s r r r s the following definitions are needed for our study definition 2 9 an integral extension r s is called infra integral 19 resp subintegral 29 if all its residual extensions r p s q with q spec s and p q r are isomorphisms resp and the natural map spec s spec r is bijective an exten sion r s is called t closed cf 19 if the relations b s r r b 2 rb r b 3 rb 2 r imply b r the t closure tsr of r in s is the smallest element b r s such that b s is t closed and the greatest element b r s such that r b is infra integral an extension r s is called seminormal cf 29 if the relations b s b 2 r b 3 r imply b r the seminormalization sr of r in s is the smallest element b r s such that b s is seminormal and the greatest element b r s such that r b is subintegral the canonical decomposition of an arbitrary ring extension r s is r sr tsr r s proposition 2 10 23 proposition 4 5 and 20 lemma 3 1 let there be an integral extension r s admitting a maximal chain c of r subextensions of s defined by r r 0 ri rn s where each ri ri 1 is minimal the following statements hold 1 r s is subintegral if and only if each ri ri 1 is ramified 2 r s is infra integral if and only if each ri ri 1 is either ramified or decomposed 3 r s is seminormal and infra integral if and only if each ri ri 1 is decomposed 4 r s is t closed if and only if each ri ri 1 is inert moreover spec s spec r is bijective if and only if each ri ri 1 is either ramified or inert proof the last result comes from theorem 2 3 where it is shown that decomposed minimal extensions are the only extensions whose spectral maps are not bijective 2 3 lattice properties letr s be an fcp extension then r s is a complete noetherian artinian lattice r being the least element and s the largest in the context of the lattice r s some definitions and properties of lattices have the following formulations see 16 1 an element t r s is an atom if and only if r t is a minimal extension we denote by a the set of atoms of r s 8 g picavet and m picavet 2 r s is called catenarian or graded by some authors working in the lattices context if r s has fcp and all maximal chains between two comparable elements have the same length 3 r s is called semimodular if for each t 1 t 2 r s such that t 1 t 2 ti is minimal for i 1 2 then ti t 1 t 2 is minimal for i 1 2 4 r s is called modular if t 1 t 2 t 3 t 2 t 1 t 3 for each t 1 t 2 t 3 r s such that t 2 t 1 5 r s is called distributive if intersection and product are each distributive with respect to the other actually each distributivity implies the other 16 exercise 5 page 33 moreover r s distributive r s modular r s semi modular r s catenarian 6 let t r s then t r s is called a complement of t if t t r and tt s 7 r s is called boolean if r s is a distributive lattice such that each t r s has a necessarily unique complement 8 r s is called a b 2 extension if r s is a boolean extension of length 2 which is equivalent to r s 2 and r s 4 see 15 fig 1 in particular if r s t is an extension satisfying the crosswise exchange then r t is a b 2 extension 9 r s is called simple if there exists x s r such that s r x 10 r s is called arithmetic if rp sp is chained for each p spec r proposition 2 11 16 corollary 1 3 4 p 172 a modular lattice of finite length is catenarian the jordan ho lder chain condition holds proposition 2 12 26 proposition 4 7 an infra integral fcp exten sion is catenarian according to 4 exercise 3 2 p 37 a finite length lattice is modular if and only if it satisfies both covering conditions which means that for a ring extension r s for each t u r s such that t u t is minimal then u tu is minimal upper covering condition and for each t u r s such that u tu is minimal then t u t is minimal lower covering condition in particular we have the following lemma 2 13 let r s be an fcp modular extension then t uv 2 for t u v r s u 6 v such that t u and t v are minimal proof assume that r s is modular and let t u v r s u 6 v such that t u and t v are minimal then t u v implies extensions 9 that u uv is minimal since any maximal chains of r s have the same length t uv t u u uv 2 proposition 2 14 a length 2 extension is modular whence catenar ian proof let r s be a length 2 extension with t 1 t 2 t 3 r s such that t 2 t 1 it t 1 t 2 then obviously t 1 t 2 t 3 t 2 t 1 t 3 if t 1 6 t 2 then either t 2 r or t 1 s and t 1 t 2 t 3 t 2 t 1 t 3 also holds the following proposition summarizes 9 propositions 7 1 7 4 7 6 and 7 10 different cases occur when considering two minimal integral extensions with the same domain the discussion is organized with respect to their crucial maximal ideals proposition 2 15 let r t and r u be two distinct minimal integral extensions whose compositum s tu exists set m c r t and n c r u the following statements hold 1 assume that m 6 n then r s r t u s 2 assume that m n r t is inert and r u is not inert then r s is not catenarian 3 assume that m n r t r u are both non inert and pq m for some p max t and some q max u both lying above m then r s is catenarian infra integral and r s 2 4 assume that m n r t r u are both non inert and pq 6 m for any p max t and any q max u both lying above m then r s is catenarian infra integral and r s 3 proof we only prove that r s r t u s in 1 indeed 9 proposition 7 10 says that t s is a minimal extension such that c t s lies over n in r in particular n r c t s 6 m shows that r s 4 by the crosswise exchange lemma 2 5 since r t u s r s the result follows 3 general properties of extensions we begin by recalling a gilmer huckaba s result about extensions proposition 3 1 13 proposition 1 let r s be a ring extension the following conditions are equivalent 1 r s is a extension 2 r s t r s r t for all s t s 10 g picavet and m picavet 3 r s 1 sn n i 1 r si for all integer n and s 1 sn s corollary 3 2 a ring extension r s is a extension if and only if t u is a extension for each t u r s proof obvious lemma 2 13 and proposition 2 14 show that modular extensions and extensions of length 2 are linked all along the paper we will see that extensions of length 2 play a significant role in particular we have the following corollary corollary 3 3 a ring extension r s is not a extension if there exist t u r s t u such that t u 2 and t u is not a extension proof obvious according to corollary 3 2 proposition 3 4 a ring extension r s is a extension if and only if t u tu for each t u r s proof let r s be a extension and let t u r s since t u is an r algebra we get that t u t u tu so that t u tu conversely t u tu shows that t u r s corollary 3 5 let r s be a ring extension and c ti i nn r s n 1 be a finite chain such that r s is pinched at c set t 0 r and tn 1 s then r s is a extension if and only if ti ti 1 is a extension for each i 0 n proof one implication results from corollary 3 2 conversely assume that ti ti 1 is a extension for each i 0 n let u v r s ni 0 ti ti 1 if u v are both in some ti ti 1 then u v uv by proposition 3 4 applied to ti ti 1 assume that u ti ti 1 and v tj tj 1 with i 6 j let for instance i j so that i 1 j then u ti 1 tj v leads to u v v uv another application of proposition 3 4 shows that r s is a extension proposition 3 6 let r s be a ring extension the following state ments are equivalent 1 r s is a extension 2 rm sm is a extension for each m msupp s r 3 rp sp is a extension for each p supp s r 4 r i s i is a extension for some ideal i shared by r and s proof obvious with the help of proposition 3 4 extensions 11 remark 3 7 according to the equivalences of proposition 3 6 and as we mostly consider in the rest of the paper fcp extensions there is no harm to replace fcp integral extensions by locally fcp integral extensions let r s be an integral extension satisfying the follow ing property any t r s such that r t is finite implies that msupp t r then r s is locally fcp if and only if r s is locally finite and for any t r s such that r t is finite then r t has fmc first assume that r s is locally finite and for any t r s such that r t is finite then r t has fmc let m max r so that there exist x 1 xn r s r m such that sm rm x 1 s xn s set t r x 1 xn which is a finite exten sion of r in particular r t has fmc and so has rm tm sm it follows that rm sm has fcp by 6 theorem 4 2 conversely assume that r s is locally fcp the previous refer ence shows that rm sm is locally finite let t r s be such that r t is finite in particular rm tm is finite for eachm max r and rm tm r t m so that rm rm tm rm r t m r r t m since rm sm has fcp so has rm tm but msupp t r implies that r t has fcp according to 6 proposition 3 7 and then has fmc proposition 3 8 let r s be a ring extension f r r a ring morphism and s r r s 1 if f r r is a faithfully flat ring morphism and if r s is a extension then so is r s 2 if f r r is a flat ring epimorphism for example a lo calization with respect to a multiplicatively closed subset and r s is a extension then so is r s proof 1 the ring morphism s s defines a map r s r s by t r r t and r s r s by t t s such that is the identity of r s by 2 proposition 10 p 52 it is enough to take f s and to observe that if m is an r submodule of s then with the notation of the above reference r m identifies to r r m the same reference shows that t u t u and t u t u for u t r s it is easy to show that tu t u then the result follows 2 the proof is a consequence of the following facts let f r r be a flat epimorphism and q spec r lying over p in r then rp r q is an isomorphism by 22 scholium a moreover we have r r s q r q rp sp so that rp sp identifies to r q r r s q 12 g picavet and m picavet remark 3 9 we deduce from the above statement 1 that the property is local on the spectrum this means that for a ring extension r s and any finite set r 1 rn of elements of r such that r rr 1 rrn then r s is a extension if and only if all the extensions rri sri have the property given a ring r recall that its nagata ring r x is the localization r x t 1 r x of the ring of polynomials r x with respect to the multiplicatively closed subset t of all polynomials with content r in 8 theorem 32 dobbs and the authors proved that when r s is an extension whose nagata extension r x s x has fip the map r s r x s x defined by t t x is an order isomorphism we look at the transfer of the property between r s and r x s x we recall the following 20 corollary 4 3 if r s has fip then r x s x has fip if and only if r sr is arithmetic proposition 3 10 an fcp extension r s is a extension if r x s x is a extension the converse hold if r x s x has fip proof assume that r x s x is a extension by 7 corollary 3 5 we have s x r x r s since r r x is faithfully flat an application of proposition 3 8 gives the result conversely assume that r s is a extension and r x s x has fip according to the previous remark the map r s r x s x defined by t t x is an order isomorphism and more precisely a lattice isomorphism then two elements of r x s x are of the form t x u x for some t u r s in particular t x u x t u x tu x t x u x then propo sition 3 4 shows that r x s x is a extension proposition 3 11 an arithmetic extension is a extension proof 20 proposition 5 16 corollary 3 12 let r s be a ring extension and t u r s such that r t and r u are minimal assume that either c r t 6 c r u or r t and r u are minimal of different types with r tu 2 then r tu is a b 2 extension and a extension proof set m c r t and n c r u with m 6 n obviously supp tu r msupp tu r m n since rm um and rn tn it follows that r tu is locally minimal then arithmetic and a extension by proposition 3 11 moreover 6 theorem 3 6 shows that the map r tu rm tmum rn tnun defined extensions 13 by v 7 vm vn for any v r tu is bijective with tmum tm and tnun un so that r tu 4 with r tu 2 therefore r tu is a b 2 extension assume now that m c r t c r u with r t and r u minimal of different types and r tu 2 in this case neither r t nor r u is minimal pru fer by lemma 2 4 in particular r tu is catenarian by proposition 2 14 and integral so that nei ther r t nor r u is minimal inert according to proposition 2 15 2 it follows that r tu is infra integral with tur 6 r tu assume that r t is minimal ramified and r u is minimal de composed since t tu is minimal it is necessarily decomposed so that t tur we now show that r tu r t u tu assume that there exists some w r tu r t u tu so that r w and w tu are minimal because r tur is minimal we cannot have r w minimal ramified but r u and r w both mini mal decomposed implies r uw seminormal infra integral according to 9 proposition 7 6 with uw s a contradiction to conclude r tu r t u tu then r tu is a b 2 extension and a extension proposition 3 13 a extension is modular and hence is catenarian when it has fcp proof let r s be a extension and let t u v r s be such that u t we always have u t v t uv since t uv t u v u t v u t v we get that t uv u t v and r s is a modular extension in particular an fcp extension is catenarian by proposition 2 11 proposition 3 14 13 theorem 1 let k l be a field extension then k l is a extension if and only if k l is chained in particular the previous proposition is satisfied when k l is either an fip purely inseparable extension 24 lemma 4 1 or a cyclic extension whose degree is a power of a prime integer in 26 before proposition 2 7 we define the following notion a property t of ring extensions r s is called convenient if the fol lowing conditions are equivalent 1 r s satisfies t 2 rm sm satisfies t for any m msupp s r 3 r i s i satisfies t for any ideal i shared by r and s proposition 3 15 let r s be an fcp extension and t a con venient property assume that r n i 1 ri is a product of rings 14 g picavet and m picavet for each i nn there exist fcp ring extensions ri si such that s n i 1 si moreover r s satisfies property t if and only if so does ri si for each i nn since the property is convenient r s is a extension if and only if so is ri si for each i nn proof the first part of the statement is 5 lemma iii 3 except for the fcp property of the ri si but this property is obvious since any t r s is of the form n i 1 ti where ti ri si for each i nn we recall the following of 21 the last paragraph of section 1 if r 1 rn are finitely many rings the ring r 1 rn localized at the prime ideal p 1 r 2 rn is isomorphic to r 1 p 1 for p 1 spec r 1 this rule works for any prime ideal of the product since a maximal ideal m max r is of the form r 1 mi rn for some i nn andmi max ri we get that rm ri mi and sm si mi in particular rm sm can be identified with ri mi si mi it follows that m msupp s r rm 6 sm ri mi 6 si mi mi msupp si ri since property t holds for r s if and only if it holds for rm sm for each m msupp s r because convenient the previous isomorphisms give the last result 4 characterization of extensions 4 1 first characterizations of extensions our results mainly hold for fcp extensions proposition 4 1 let r s be a ring extension the following state ments hold 1 r s is a pru fer extension if and only if r s is an integrally closed extension 2 if r s is integrally closed and supp s r the follow ing conditions are equivalent a r s is a extension b r s is an fcp extension c r s is an fip extension proof 1 a pru fer extension is integrally closed by 22 scholium b then arithmetic by 20 theorem 5 17 and a extension by proposi tion 3 11 conversely if r s is an integrally closed extension then r s is a pru fer extension by 14 theorem 1 7 page 88 2 using 1 22 proposition 1 3 gives the equivalence of a and b because an integrally closed extension r s has fcp if and only if r s is pru fer with supp s r the equivalence of b and extensions 15 c follows from 6 theorem 6 3 because an integrally closed extension has fip if and only if it has fcp lemma 4 2 let r s be a ring extension and t u r s then t u tu if msupp t r msupp u r proof letm max r msupp t r msupp u r then rm tm um yields t u m tm um rm tmum tu m let m msupp t r so that m 6 msupp u r then rm um yields t u m tm um tm tmum tu m letm msupp u r so thatm 6 msupp t r then rm tm yields t u m tm um um tmum tu m since for each m max r it holds that t u m tu m we have t u tu in 22 definition 4 1 we call an extension r s almost pru fer if it can be factored r u s where r u is pru fer and u s is integral actually u is the pru fer hull r of the extension that is the greatest t r s such that r t is pru fer lemma 4 3 let r s be an fcp extension then r r is a extension if and only if t tu is a extension for any subextension t u of r s proof one implication is obvious now assume that r r is a extension and consider the tower r t u s set r 1 r t and s 1 t u we get the following commutative diagram where i resp p indicates an integral resp pru fer extension t i s 1 p u p p r i r 1 i ru s the definition of r 1 and s 1 implies that r 1 t and r u s 1 t u are integrally closed and then pru fer extensions by 22 proposition 1 3 2 while t s 1 and r 1 r u are integral then r 1 s 1 is almost pru fer with t r 1 s 1 the pru fer hull of the extension r 1 s 1 and r u r 1 s 1 it follows that msupp t r 1 msupp r u r 1 and msupp s 1 r 1 msupp t r 1 msupp r u r 1 by 22 proposition 4 18 since r u r we deduce from corollary 3 2 that r 1 r u is a extension and so is r 1 m r u m for each m max r 1 by proposition 3 6 let v w t s 1 and m max r 1 if m 6 16 g picavet and m picavet msupp r u r 1 we get that r u m r 1 m which implies that r 1 m s 1 m is pru fer so that tm s 1 m vm wm then v w m vm wm vm vmwm vw m if m msupp r u r 1 we get thatm 6 msupp t r 1 so that tm r 1 m which in turn implies that r 1 m s 1 m is integral and s 1 m r u m this shows that tm r 1 m s 1 m r u m is a extension so that v w m vm wm vmwm vw m to conclude we have v w m vw m for each m max r 1 and then v w vw showing that t s 1 t u is a extension proposition 4 4 let r s be an fcp extension and t u r s such that r t is integral and r u is pru fer then u t ut proof since r t is integral we have t r r and since r u is pru fer we have u r r by definition of the pru fer hull then msupp t r msupp r r and msupp u r msupp r r but msupp r r msupp r r by 22 proposition 4 18 it follows that msupp t r msupp u r and lemma 4 2 shows that u t ut theorem 4 5 an fcp extension r s is a extension if and only if r r is a extension proof corollary 3 2 gives one implication conversely assume that r s is an fcp extension such that r r is a extension let v w r s and set t v w u vw we denote by u resp v w the integral closure of t in u resp v w according to lemma 4 3 t u is a extension in particular v w v w 1 since v w u we get the following commutative diagram where i resp p indi cates an integral resp pru fer extension v p v i vw i i p p t v w u i i p p w p w i vw since v v is pru fer and v v w is integral proposition 4 4 leads to v v w v v w vw 2 for the same reason we get w v w vw 3 moreover v vw and w vw are almost pru fer with v resp w as pru fer hull of v vw resp w vw according to 22 extensions 17 proposition 4 16 msupp v v msupp v w v we claim that vw vw and vw vw are pru fer indeed msupp vw v msupp v v msupp vw v let m msupp vw v if m msupp v v then vm vmwm so that v mwm vm vmwm is pru fer if m msupp vw v then vm v m leads to v mwm vmwm it follows that vw vw is pru fer the same holds for vw vw it follows that vw vw vw vw is pru fer since vw and vw are both contained in the pru fer hull of vw u then vw vw is a extension by proposition 4 1 so that vw vw vw vw vw 4 adding 2 and 3 and using 1 and 4 this leads to v v w w v w v v w w v w v w vw vw vw to conclude we obtain v w vw for any v w r s and r s is a extension remark 4 6 when r s is an almost unbranched fcp extension the result of theorem 4 5 is gotten immediately indeed corollary 2 7 shows that r s is pinched at r since r s is a extension by proposition 4 1 then corollary 3 5 gives the result of theorem 4 5 theorem 4 5 shows that it is enough to characterize integral extensions that are fcp which we are aiming to do by using the paths of the canonical decomposition proposition 4 7 a t closed fcp extension r s is a extension if and only if r s is arithmetic proof one implication is proposition 3 11 conversely assume that r s is a extension by proposition 3 6 we can assume that r m is a local ring so that r s m because s m is a local ring by 7 lemma 3 17 moreover r m s m is a extension again by proposition 3 6 and a field extension then r m s m is chained by proposition 3 14 and so is r s lemma 4 8 if r s is a catenarian fcp extension and t u r s are such that r t is infra integral and r u is t closed then t u tu and msupp t r msupp u r proof we claim that msupp t r msupp u r deny and let m msupp t r msupp u r according to 23 lemma 1 8 there exist v r t and w r u such that r v is minimal infra integral that is either ramified or decomposed and r w is minimal inert while both extensions have m as conductor it follows that there exist two maximal chains from r to vw whose lengths are different by proposition 2 15 contradicting that r s is catenarian 18 g picavet and m picavet moreover msupp tu r msupp t r msupp u r now let m msupp tu r if m msupp t r then m 6 msupp u r so that rm um giving t u m tm um tm tmum tu m if m msupp u r then m 6 msupp t r so that rm tm giving t u m tm um um tmum tu m if finally m 6 msupp tu r then rm tm um giving t u m tm um rm tmum tu m since t u m tu m for any m max r we get t u tu lemma 4 9 let r s be a catenarian integral fcp extension then t sr s is arithmetic if and only if tut u is arithmetic for any subextension t u of r s proof one implication is obvious now assume that tsr s is arith metic consider the tower r t u s and set r 1 tur r 2 t sr and t 1 t ut we get the following commutative diagram where i resp t indicates an infra integral resp t closed extension t i t 1 t u t r i r 1 i r 2 t s since r 1 is the t closure of r in u and r t u s we get that r 1 t 1 and r 1 r 2 the definition of r 1 r 2 and t 1 implies that r 1 t 1 t 1 u and r 2 s are t closed while r r 1 t t 1 and r 1 r 2 are infra integral by lemma 4 8 and because r s is catenarian msuppr 1 u r 1 msuppr 1 r 2 r 1 moreover msuppr 1 u r 1 msuppr 1 r 2 r 1 msuppr 1 ur 2 r 1 let n msuppt 1 u t 1 and set m n r 1 so that m msuppr 1 u r 1 according to 7 lemma 3 17 m r 1 m r 1 m t 1 m r 1 m um and is the maximal ideal of the local rings t 1 m and um because r 1 m um is t closed as is r 1 m t 1 m in particular n is the only maximal ideal of t 1 lying above m and we get t 1 m t 1 n and um un moreover m 6 msupp r 2 r 1 which yields r 1 m r 2 m to conclude we get the tower r 2 m r 1 m t 1 m um sm where r 2 m sm is chained and so is t 1 m t 1 n um un then tut u is arithmetic lemma 4 10 let r s be a catenarian integral fcp extension then r tsr is a extension if and only if t tut is a extension for any subextension t u of r s extensions 19 proof one implication is obvious now assume that r tsr is a extension consider the tower r t u s set r 1 tur r 2 t sr t 1 t tr and t 2 t ut there is no harm to assume that t 2 6 t we get the following commutative diagram where i resp t indicates an infra integral resp t closed extension t 1 t t i t 2 t u i i t r i r 1 i r 2 t s since r 1 is the t closure of r in u and r t u s we get that t 1 r 1 t 2 and r 1 r 2 then r 1 is also the t closure of t 1 in t 2 it follows from the definitions of r 1 r 2 t 1 and t 2 that t 1 t r 1 t 2 t 2 u and r 2 s are t closed while r t 1 t 1 r 1 r r 1 t t 2 and r 1 r 2 are infra integral since r r 2 is a extension so is t 1 r 1 let n msuppt t 2 t and set m n t 1 max t 1 then m msuppt 1 t 2 t and t 1 m t 2 m is not t closed whence t 1 m 6 r 1 m from whch we deduce that m msuppt 1 r 1 t 1 now lemma 4 8 shows that m 6 msuppt 1 t t 1 in particular n is the only maximal ideal of t lying above m then we have t 1 m tm tn by 6 lemma 2 4 for the same reason t 2 m t 2 n r 1 m where the last equality is consequence of the following facts t 1 m t 2 m is infra integral and r 1 t 2 is t closed with r 1 t 1 t 2 then t 1 m tm tn t 2 n t 2 m r 1 m is a extension because so is r r 1 since this property holds for any n msuppt t 2 t we get that t t 2 tut is a extension by proposition 3 6 the proof of the next theorem mimics the proof of theorem 4 5 theorem 4 11 a catenarian integral fcp extension r s is a extension if and only if r tsr and tsr s are extensions the last condition is equivalent to tsr s is arithmetic proof one implication is obvious because of proposition 4 7 and corol lary 3 2 conversely assume that r s is a catenarian fcp integral extension such that r tsr is a extension and tsr s is arithmetic let v w r s and set t v w u vw and u 1 tut resp v 1 t v t w 1 t wt according to lemma 4 10 we get that t u 1 is a extension in particular v 1 w 1 v 1 w 1 1 since v 1 w 1 t u 1 we get the following commutative diagram where i resp t indi cates an infra integral resp t closed extension 20 g picavet and m picavet v 1 t v i vw 1 i i t t t v 1 w 1 u vw i i t t w 1 t w i v 1 w since v 1 v is t closed and v 1 v 1 w 1 is infra integral because t v 1 w 1 u 1 implies t v 1 w 1 u 1 the t closure of t in u so that t u 1 is infra integral lemma 4 8 gives v v 1 w 1 v v 1 w 1 vw 1 2 for the same reason we get w v 1 w 1 v 1 w 3 now v 1 w 1 vw 1 and v 1 w 1 v 1 w are t closed in deed lemma 4 8 yields msuppv 1 v v 1 msuppv 1 v 1 w 1 v 1 and msuppv 1 v v 1 msuppv 1 v 1 w 1 v 1 msuppv 1 vw 1 v 1 let m msuppv 1 vw 1 v 1 if m msuppv 1 v v 1 then v 1 m v 1 m w 1 m entails that v 1 m v 1 m w 1 m vm w 1 m v 1 mvm w 1 m v 1 mvm vm is t closed if m msuppv 1 v 1 w 1 v 1 then v 1 m vm so that v 1 m w 1 m vm w 1 m it follows that v 1 w 1 vw 1 is t closed for the same reason v 1 w 1 v 1 w is t closed now v 1 w 1 vw is also t closed assume that the contrary holds let u be the t closure of v 1 w 1 in vw and m msupp u v 1 w 1 lemma 4 8 implies thatm 6 msupp vw 1 v 1 w 1 msupp v 1 w v 1 w 1 because r s is catenarian then vw 1 m vm w 1 m v 1 w 1 m v 1 m w 1 m v 1 w m v 1 mwm which leads to v 1 w 1 m vw m a contradiction because m msupp u v 1 w 1 and u v 1 w 1 v w then v 1 w 1 vw is a extension by proposition 4 7 and lemma 4 9 so that vw 1 v 1 w vw 1 v 1 w vw 4 now 2 and 3 using 1 and 4 combine to yield that vw vw 1 v 1 w v v 1 w 1 w v 1 w 1 v v 1 w 1 w v 1 w 1 v w to conclude we obtained v w vw for any v w r s and r s is a extension corollary 4 12 an unbranched integral fcp extension r s is a extension if and only if r s is pinched at tsr r tsr is a extension and tsr s is chained in particular if these conditions hold r s is catenarian proof since r s is integral unbranched then s is local let n be the maximal ideal of s then n tsr s and is also the maximal ideal of tsr because t sr s is t closed 6 proposition 4 10 moreover extensions 21 sr t sr because r s is spectrally bijective by proposition 2 10 so that any t r s is local 25 lemma 3 29 andr tsr is subintegral assume that r s is a extension and then is catenarian by proposition 3 13 then r tsr is a extension by corollary 3 2 and t sr s is chained by proposition 4 7 moreover r s is pinched at t sr according to 26 theorem 4 13 conversely assume that r s is pinched at tsr r tsr is a extension and tsr s is chained let c ri ni 0 be a maximal chain of r s since any ri r tsr tsr s and ri 1 ri is minimal for each i nn there exists some k 0 n such that rk t sr if k 0 then r s is t closed and chained then a extension if k n then r s is a extension by assumption now assume that k nn 1 it follows that ri ki 0 is a maximal chain of r tsr and ri ni k is a maximal chain of tsr s but c n k n k r tsr tsr s because r tsr is a extension and then catenarian by proposition 3 13 and tsr s is chained hence all the maximal chains of r s have the same length then r s is catenarian and is a extension by theorem 4 11 in case of a t closed extension we recover proposition 4 7 but this proposition was necessary to prove theorem 4 11 and corollary 4 12 example 4 13 here is an example of an integral fcp extension k s such that k is a local ring but s is not a local ring so that the extension is branched as a corollary we get that k k 3 is a extension let k be a field k k 3 the ring extension defined as the diagonal map e 1 e 2 e 3 the canonical basis of k 3 whose elements are idempo tents of the ring k 3 and k k a minimal field extension we know that k k 3 has fip by 21 proposition 2 1 according to 7 proposi tion 4 15 k k 3 k r 1 r 2 r 3 k 3 where ri kei k 1 ei for i 1 2 3 set r ke 1 k 1 e 1 and s ke 1 ke 2 ke 3 rk 3 in particular n k 3 s ke 2 ke 3 is a maximal ideal of k 3 and s it is easily seen that we have the following commutative diagram where d resp i indicates a minimal decomposed resp inert extension r 2 and r 3 do not appear to make the situation clearer r i d k d r 1 s d i k 3 22 g picavet and m picavet in particular k s is seminormal because so are k k 3 and k 3 s then k s k since k 3 tsk obviously r 6 k tsk tsk s we claim that k s k r 1 r 2 r 3 k 3 r s we first show that there does not exist some l k s ri 3 i 1 such that k l is minimal suppose that the contrary holds we proved above that k l can be neither decomposed nor ramified since l 6 k k 3 then k l is inert and a minimal field extension with some x l k but l s implies that x y z t with y k and z t k let p x k x be the monic minimal polynomial of x over k it follows that p x is irreducible in k x and satisfies p y p z p t 0 a contradiction since x 6 k hence there does not exists such l we have just also proved that the only minimal extensions of r 1 are r 1 k 3 and r 1 r indeed r 1 r is the only minimal inert subextension of r 1 s starting from r 1 and r 1 k 3 is the only minimal decomposed subextension of r 1 s starting from r 1 let i 6 1 for instance i 2 the proof would be the same for i 3 then r 2 k 3 is the only minimal decomposed extension of r 2 since k 3 tsk there does not exist any u r 2 s such that r 2 u is minimal ramified for the same reason assume that there is some u r 2 s such that r 2 u is minimal inert moreover r 2 has two maximal ideals n 1 ke 2 and n 2 k 1 e 2 k e 1 e 3 with r 2 k 3 n 1 we claim that r 2 u n 2 indeed by 9 proposition 7 1 r 2 u n 1 leads to a contradiction k 3 s is not minimal then n 2 max u but n 1 s ke 2 ke 1 ke 2 ke 3 ke 2 n 1 shows that n 1 r 2 s is also an ideal of u a contradiction since n 1 n 2 r 2 it follows that k k 3 and k r are the only extensions of k of length 2 since k 3 s and r s are minimal we get that k s k r 1 r 2 r 3 k 3 r s k k 3 r s it remains to show that u v uv for any u v k s the result is obvious if either u v k k 3 or u k k 3 and v s or u v r s the two last cases are when either u k k 3 and v r or u r and v k k 3 which are also obvious then k s is a extension in particular k k 3 is a extension by corollary 3 2 because k 3 is a subextension of s rk 3 according to theorem 4 11 we can reduce our study to infra integral fcp extensions these extensions are catenarian by proposition 2 12 we will see in the next subsection that for such extensions the property is linked to extensions of length 2 4 2 properties linked to extensions of length 2 we begin with the following lemmas extensions 23 lemma 4 14 let r s be an fcp extension and t u r s t 6 u be such that t u t t u u t u tu if r t and r u are minimal so are t tu and u tu in particular r t u proof since we have the chain r t u t with r t minimal it follows that either t u r or t u t in the last case we should have r t u with r u minimal a contradiction then r t u and r t r u 2 r tu with t u tu both minimal lemma 4 15 let r s be an fcp extension and t u r s t 6 u be such that r tu is infra integral with r t and r u minimal then r tu is a extension if and only if r tu 2 proof assume first that r tu is a extension then r tu is modular by proposition 3 13 and r tu 2 by lemma 2 13 conversely assume that r tu 2 and let v w r tu we are aiming to show that v w vw the result is obvious if either v w or v r tu or w r tu in the other cases r v w and v w tu are minimal infra integral extensions in particular vw tu set m c r v and n c r w assume first thatm 6 n then corollary 3 12 shows that r tu is a extension assume now that m n in particular m r tu using proposition 3 6 working with the extension r m tu m and setting k r m we get that dimk v m dimk w m 2 by minimality of the infra integral extensions r v and r w and theorem 2 3 this leads to dimk v w m 3 since k v m and k w m are still minimal infra integral extensions there exist x v m k and y w m k such that v m k x k kx and w m k y k ky moreover we may choose x resp y generating the or one of the two maximal ideal s of v m resp w m since we still have k tu m k vw m 2 it follows from 9 proposition 7 6 that xy 0 so that vw m k x y k kx ky giving dimk vw m 3 to end v w m vw m leads to v w vw and r tu is a extension theorem 4 16 an infra integral fcp extension of length two is a extension proof let r s be an infra integral fcp extension of length two let t u r s t 6 u be such that r t and r u are minimal since t tu s it follows that tu s giving r tu 2 hence r s is a extension by lemma 4 15 24 g picavet and m picavet lemma 4 17 let r s be an infra integral fcp extension for any t u v r s u 6 v such that u t and v t are minimal then u v t 2 proof set w u v m u t and n v t we use several dual results of proposition 2 15 we claim that m 6 n deny then 9 proposition 5 7 asserts that m max w so that m w u a contradiction because w u is infra integral and not t closed then m 6 n if either m and n are incomparable or not at least one of w u and w v is minimal infra integral by 9 proposition 6 6 it follows that w t 2 because w t is infra integral and then catenarian according to proposition 2 12 theorem 4 18 let r s be an infra integral fcp extension the following conditions are equivalent 1 r s is a extension 2 r s is modular 3 t u t t u u t u tu for any t u r s 4 r s is semi modular 5 t uv 2 for any t u v r s such that t u and t v are minimal with u 6 v proof 1 2 is proposition 3 13 2 3 by 28 theorem 4 15 3 1 assume that t u t t u u t u tu for any t u r s let v w r s we claim that v w vw choose two maximal chains r v 0 v 1 vi vn v and r w 0 w 1 wj wm w such that vi vi 1 and wj wj 1 are minimal infra integral for each i 0 n 1 and each j 0 m 1 we are going to show by induction on k 2 m n that vi 1 wj viwj and viwj 1 viwj are minimal and that vi wj viwj for each i j 1 such that i j k i n j m let k 2 so that i j 1 since r v 1 and r w 1 are minimal so are v 1 v 1 w 0 v 1 w 1 and w 1 v 0 w 1 v 1 w 1 by lemma 4 14 moreover r v 1 w 1 2 so that v 1 w 1 v 1 w 1 by lemma 4 15 then the induction hypothesis holds for k 2 assume that the induction hypothesis holds for k m n so that for any i j such that i j k we have vi 1 wj viwj 1 viwj minimal and vi wj viwj let be such that k 1 then 1 1 k and the induction hypothesis holds extensions 25 for k consider the following commutative diagram v 1 v v w 1 v 1 w 1 v w w 1 w v 1 w it follows that v 1 w 1 v 1 w v w 1 are minimal and so are v 1 w v w 1 v w by lemma 4 14 now v 1 w 1 v w 2 so that v 1 w v w 1 v 1 w v w 1 v w by lemma 4 15 but v 1 w v 1 w and v w 1 v w 1 by the induction hypothesis for k then yields v w v 1 w v w 1 v 1 w v w 1 v w then the induction hypothesis holds for k 1 as it holds for any k in particular for k n m we get vn wm v w vnwm vw then r s is a extension 2 4 see the properties at the beginning of subsection 2 3 4 5 assume that t u and t v are minimal with u 6 v so that t u v 4 implies that u uv and v uv are minimal by definition of a semi modular extension it follows that t uv 2 giving 5 5 2 in order to prove that r s is modular we are going to show that both covering conditions are satisfied that is for each t u r s such that t u t is minimal then u tu is minimal and for each t u r s such that u tu is minimal then t u t is minimal see 28 definition page 105 and theorem 4 15 first let t u r s be such that t u t is minimal we prove that u tu is minimal by induction on l t u u if l 1 then t u u is minimal and u tu is minimal by 5 since t u tu 2 assume that the induction hypothesis holds for l 1 and let u t u u be such that u u is minimal so that t u t u and t u u l 1 from the induction hypothesis we deduce that u tu is minimal using 5 for the minimal extensions u tu and u u we get that u tu 2 so that u tu is minimal in the same way let t u r s be such that u tu is minimal we prove that t u t is minimal by induction on r t tu if r 1 the result holds by lemma 4 17 since t u tu are minimal assume that the induction hypothesis holds for r 1 and let t t tu be such that t t is minimal so that tu t u and t t u r 1 from the induction hypothesis we deduce that t u t is minimal using again lemma 4 17 for the minimal 26 g picavet and m picavet extensions t t and t u t we get that t u t is minimal to conclude r s is modular we may remark that 1 2 in the above theorem re proves the orem 4 16 by proposition 2 14 proposition 4 19 let k be a field and n a positive integer n 1 then k kn is an fip extension if and only if n 3 proof according to 21 proposition 2 1 for any positive integer n k kn is an fip extension for n 2 k k 2 is a minimal extension by 11 lemme 1 2 and then a extension by proposition 3 11 since arithmetic example 4 13 asserts that the result is valid for n 3 let n 4 and let b e 1 en be the canonical basis of the k algebra kn set x e 1 e 2 and y e 1 e 3 then xy e 1 k x y and xy 6 k x k y k e 1 e 2 k e 1 e 3 k k e 1 e 2 k e 1 e 3 using proposition 3 1 we get that k kn is not a extension corollary 4 20 let r s be a seminormal infra integral fcp ex tension the following conditions are equivalent 1 r s is a extension 2 vs ms 3 for any m msupp s r 3 rm sm 2 for any m msupp s r proof 1 2 according to proposition 3 6 r s is a extension if and only if rm sm is a extension for any m msupp s r moreover vs ms 3 for any m msupp s r if and only if max sm 3 for any m msupp s r indeed max sm nsm n max s m n nsm n max s m vs ms therefore we can assume that r m is a local ring since r s is a seminormal fcp extension we deduce from 6 proposition 4 9 that r s m is an intersection of finitely many maximal ideals of s moreover r s being infra integral s m r m n where n max s by the chinese remainder theorem moreover r s is a extension if and only if r m s m is a extension by propo sition 3 6 since r m is a field r m r m n is a extension if and only if n 3 by proposition 4 19 to conclude r s is a extension if and only if vs ms 3 for any m msupp s r 2 3 by 6 lemma 5 4 since rm sm max sm 1 vs ms 1 4 3 applications of extensions of length 2 to extensions before giving a more striking characterization of fcp infra integral extensions we need the following technical lemmas extensions 27 lemma 4 21 let r s be an infra integral fcp extension over the local ring r m such that r sr is a extension and sr s is minimal decomposed let t u r s t 6 r sr be such that t u is subintegral then the following hold 1 max s max t max u 2 2 let v t u and set w v sr vr then t v tr w 3 for any v 1 v 2 t u such that t v 1 v 2 are minimal then v 1 v 2 v 1 v 2 and v 1 v 2 v 1 v 2 are minimal ramified 4 t u is a extension proof 1 since r m is a local ring so is sr and max s 2 since sr s is minimal decomposed we also have max t 2 because t 6 r sr implies that r t is not subintegral which gives that max r max t max s 2 it follows that max u max t 2 because t u is subintegral 2 let v t u and w v sr vr since t u is subintegral so is t v which implies that max v 2 but tr t andw v are seminormal infra integral therefore tr t and w v are minimal decomposed and tr t w v 1 now tr v tr t t v tr w w v because r s is infra integral whence catenarian by proposition 2 12 so we get t v tr w 3 let v 1 v 2 t u be such that t v 1 v 2 are minimal rami fied as in 2 set wi sr vi vir for i 1 2 which are local rings since t v 1 v 2 is subintegral because v 1 v 2 t u there is no harm to assume that u v 1 v 2 as t v 1 t v 2 max t we consider two cases a t v 1 6 t v 2 propositions 2 15 1 and 3 4 and lemma 4 15 say that v 1 v 2 v 1 v 2 moreover proposition 2 15 shows that v 1 v 2 v 1 v 2 are minimal ramified b t v 1 t v 2 set n t v 1 t v 2 for each i 1 2 there is a unique ni max vi lying above n since max u max t is bijective then mi ni wi is the maximal ideal of wi from 2 we deduce that tr wi is minimal ramified with conductor m n tr the maximal ideal of tr in particular w 1 w 2 tr sr where tr sr is a extension because so is r sr then tr w 1 w 2 2 by lemma 4 15 an application of proposition 2 15 shows that m 1 m 2 m since max t max vi 2 let n resp n i be the other maximal ideal of t resp of vi then m nn because tr t 28 g picavet and m picavet is minimal decomposed for the same reason we have mi nin i by theorem 2 3 then yields n 1 n 1 n 2 n 2 m 1 m 2 m nn since n 6 msupp vi t we have tn vi n nn ni n moreover n n tn and n i n vi n localizing at the two maximal ideals n n of t we get n 1 n 1 n 2 n 2 n n 1 n 2 n nn and n 1 n 2 n tn nn it follows that n 1 n 2 n so that t v 1 v 2 2 by proposition 2 15 and v 1 v 2 v 1 v 2 since t v 1 v 2 is a extension by lemma 4 15 in particular v 1 v 1 v 2 and v 2 v 1 v 2 are minimal ramified extensions 4 let v v t u we want to show that v v v v since r s has fcp there exists a maximal chain v 0 t v 1 vi vn v and a maximal chain v 0 t v 1 v j v m v such that vi vi 1 and v j v j 1 are minimal extensions for each i 0 n 1 j 0 m 1 we mimic the proof of theorem 4 18 although the assumptions are not the same we are going to show by induction on k 2 m n that vi 1 v j viv j and viv j 1 viv j are minimal and vi v j viv j for each i j 1 such that i j k i n j m if k 2 then i j 1 since t v 1 and t v 1 are minimal v 1 v 1 v 1 v 1 by 3 and the induction hypothesis holds for k 2 assume that the induction hypothesis holds for k hence for any i j such that i j k we have that vi 1 v j viv j 1 viv j are minimal and vi v j viv j let be such that k 1 and consider the following commutative diagram v 1 v v v 1 v 1 v 1 v v v 1 v v 1 v then 1 1 k since the induction hypothesis holds for k it follows that v 1 v 1 v 1 v v v 1 are minimal moreover v 1 v 1 v v t u implies that v 1 v 1 v v is subintegral applying 3 to this extension we get that v 1 v v v 1 v 1 v v v 1 v v but v 1 v v 1 v and v v 1 v v 1 by the induction hypothesis for k then yields v v v 1 v v v 1 v 1 v v v 1 v v moreover v 1 v v v 1 v v are minimal by 3 then the induction hypothesis holds for k 1 as it holds for any k in particular for k n m we get vn v m v v vnv m v v then t u is a extension extensions 29 corollary 4 22 let r s be an infra integral fcp extension over the local ring r m such that r sr is a extension and sr s is minimal decomposed let t u r s be such that t u is subintegral then t u is a extension proof according to lemma 4 21 it is enough to verify only the case where t r sr which is obvious since u r sr and r sr is a extension use corollary 3 2 lemma 4 23 let r s be an infra integral fcp extension such that r m is a local ring r sr and sr s are extensions let t u r s t 6 r sr sr s be such that t u is subintegral then t u is a extension proof since sr s is a extension max u max s 3 by corollary 4 20 since sr 6 s we have max s 2 because sr s 1 and there is at least one minimal decomposed extension sr v with v sr s then use theorem 2 3 we are done if max s 2 by lemma 4 21 since in this case sr s is minimal decomposed so assume that max s 3 if max u 2 we may apply lemma 4 21 to the extension r u because ur sr and ur u is minimal decomposed in which case we are done assume now that max u max t 3 since t u is subintegral then tr t max t 1 2 by 6 lemma 5 4 since tr t is seminormal infra integral it follows that there exists t tr t such that tr t and t t are minimal decomposed in particular max t 2 set u t ur ur u n tr ur r 0 tr and t 0 t we are going to prove that there is some m n which will be exhibited below and by induction on i nm such that for each i nm there exist ri tr ur and ti t u where ti t ri ri 1 ri 1 2 ri ti is minimal decomposed and t ti is subintegral since r s has fcp there exists r 1 tr ur such that r 0 r 1 is minimal ramified consider t r 1 t u using proposition 2 15 two cases occur according to the behavior of the maximal ideals of t and r 1 case a t t r 1 is minimal ramified and r 1 t r 1 is minimal decomposed then we set t 1 t r 1 t u and r 1 r 1 it fol lows that r 0 r 1 is minimal ramified r 1 t 1 is minimal decomposed and t t 1 is subintegral case b we use 9 proposition 7 6 there exists t 1 t t r 1 such that t t 1 and t 1 t r 1 are minimal ramified and r 1 r 1 t r 1 such that r 1 t r 1 is minimal decomposed and r 1 r 1 is minimal ramified we have the following commutative diagram where 30 g picavet and m picavet the horizontal maps are ramified and the vertical maps are decomposed t t 0 t 1 t r 1 tr r 0 r 1 r 1 set t 1 t r 1 t u and r 1 r 1 it follows that r 0 r 1 2 r 1 t 1 is minimal decomposed t t 1 is subintegral and t 1 t r 1 the induction hypothesis holds for i 1 assume that the induction hypothesis holds for i nn 1 so that there exist ri tr ur and ti t u such that ri 1 ri 1 2 ri ti is minimal decomposed t ti is subintegral and ti t ri we mimic the proof made for i 1 and use again proposition 2 15 and 9 proposition 7 6 since ri tr ur there exists r i 1 tr ur such that ri r i 1 is minimal ramified and two cases occur according to the behavior of the maximal ideals of ti and r i 1 similar to the case i 1 in case a ti tir i 1 is minimal ramified and r i 1 tir i 1 is minimal decomposed then we set ri 1 r i 1 tr ur and ti 1 tiri 1 t u it follows that ri ri 1 is minimal ramified ri 1 ti 1 is minimal decomposed t ti 1 is subintegral and ti 1 tiri 1 t riri 1 t ri 1 then the induction hypothesis holds for i 1 in case b there exists t i ti tir i 1 t u such that ti t i and t i tir i 1 are minimal ramified and r i 1 ri tir i 1 such that r i 1 tir i 1 is minimal decomposed and r i 1 r i 1 is minimal ramified we do not draw a new diagram it is enough to replace 0 with i and 1 with i 1 in the above diagram then we set ti 1 tir i 1 and ri 1 r i 1 it follows that ri ri 1 2 ri 1 ti 1 is minimal decomposed t ti 1 is subintegral and ti 1 tir i 1 tir i 1 r i 1 tir i 1 t rir i 1 t r i 1 t ri 1 because r i 1 ri 1 tir i 1 the induction hypothesis holds for i 1 once ri 1 ur is gotten we set m i 1 in which case tm t ur u ur u with ur u minimal decomposed and t u subintegral we can apply lemma 4 21 to the extension r u which gives that t u is a extension we may remark that when we get that ri ur is minimal ramified we are necessarily in case a since r i 1 ur set max t m m so that t m mm is a local ring we are first going to show that tm um and tm um are extensions observe that the context is as follows t m um is an infra integral fcp extension where the local ring t m mm verifies u m um t m t u is a extension and so is t m u m by proposition 3 6 either extensions 31 t m tm is minimal decomposed or t m tm in this last case um u m so that tm um is a extension if t m tm is mini mal decomposed the assumptions of lemma 4 21 are satisfied for the extension t m um as tm um is a subintegral subextension of t m um we get that tm um is a extension in the same way tm um is a extension we intend to show that t u is a extension by applying twice proposition 3 6 indeed max t 3 moreover t t m since t m tm is minimal decomposed let n p max t be lying over m and n max t be lying over m then tm tn um un and tn tp resp un up are localizations of tm resp um so that tn un tp up and tn un are extensions and so is t u corollary 4 24 let r s be an infra integral fcp extension over the local ring r m such that r sr and sr s are extensions then a subintegral subextension t u of r s is a extension proof according to lemma 4 23 it is enough to assume that t r sr sr s if t r sr so is u then t u is a extension because r sr is a extension if t sr s then t u s implies that u sr s a contradiction with t u is subintegral then in any case t u is a extension proposition 4 25 an infra integral fcp extension r s is a extension if and only if the following statements hold 1 r sr and sr s are extensions 2 for each t u v r s such that t u is minimal ramified and t v is minimal decomposed t uv is a b 2 extension or equivalently a extension or equivalently t uv 2 proof one implication is obvious in the light of corollary 3 2 and lemma 4 15 moreover in 2 the three conditions are equivalent in deed if t u is minimal ramified and t v is minimal decomposed then t uv is infra integral by proposition 2 10 then t uv is a extension if and only if t uv 2 by lemma 4 15 at last 23 theorem 6 1 5 gives that t uv 2 if and only if t uv 4 conversely assume that 1 and 2 hold since r s is infra integral there is no minimal inert subextension of r s always by proposition 2 10 we can assume that r m is a local ring and so is sr it follows that max s 3 by corollary 4 20 according to theorem 4 18 it is enough to verify that t uv 2 for any t u v r s such that t u and t v are minimal with u 6 v if they are minimal of different types that is one is minimal ramified 32 g picavet and m picavet and the other minimal decomposed t uv 2 by 2 assume that t u and t v are both minimal ramified then t uv is subintegral if t r sr so are u and v then t uv is a extension by 1 so that t uv 2 by theorem 4 18 moreover we cannot have t sr s since t u is minimal ramified if t 6 r sr sr s then t uv is a extension by lemma 4 23 so that t uv 2 by theorem 4 18 at last assume that t u and t v are both minimal decomposed by proposition 2 15 t uv 3 but 9 proposition 7 6 b says that when t uv 3 there exists u u uv such that u u and u uv are both minimal decomposed it follows that max t 3 max uv max s 3 a contradiction then t uv 2 this equality holding in any case r s is a extension by theorem 4 18 remark 4 26 the condition 2 of proposition 4 25 is necessary in order to have a extension as it is shown in the following example we use 27 example 5 of 16 4 and its results let s be the ring of integers of q 7 i then s is a z module of basis b 1 7 t u where t 7 i 2 and u 1 i 7 2 it is shown that 2 s q 2 1 q 2 2 where q 1 q 2 are the maximal ideals of s lying above 2 z set r z 2 s and w sr then 2 s r s is a maximal ideal of r it is easy to see that w z q 1 q 2 so that w s is minimal decomposed and then a extension hence the second part of condition 1 of proposition 4 25 is satisfied set u 1 z q 2 1 q 2 and v 1 z q 2 1 a short calculation shows that r u 1 and v 1 s are both minimal ramified while u 1 v 1 is minimal decomposed then r s 3 which leads to r w 2 it follows that r w is a extension by theorem 4 16 and the first part of condition 1 of proposition 4 25 is satisfied we show that condition 2 of proposition 4 25 is not satisfied set t r x where x 1 7 since x 2 8 2 7 2 s and 2 xs 2 s we get that r t is minimal ramified by theorem 2 3 set t r u since u 2 u 2 2 s and 2 us 2 s we get that r t is minimal decomposed by theorem 2 3 now tt r x u r 7 1 i 7 2 with 7 1 i 7 2 t 3 i tt but i 2 t 7 t tt implies that t tt to conclude tt s and r tt 2 shows that r s is not a extension we can check that t t is not a ring because it does not contain 7 u we will see in section 5 an example where conditions of proposition 4 25 hold in the context of number field orders lemma 4 27 let r s be an integral fcp extension such that t uv 2 for each t u v r s such that t u and t v extensions 33 are minimal of different types then for any maximal chain c of r s there exists a maximal chain c of r s containing tsr such that c c proof let c be a maximal chain of r s according to 26 propo sition 4 11 there exists a maximal chain c of r s containing tsr such that c c assume that c 6 c the same ref erence shows that there exist a b c c such that a b is in ert b c is minimal non inert and a b b c set w tca 6 a c because a c is neither infra integral nor t closed and m a b b c max a in particular m a c let w 1 a w be such that a w 1 is minimal non inert in par ticular m a w 1 then proposition 2 15 asserts that a bw 1 is not catenarian a contradiction with a bw 1 2 by assumption and 26 proposition 3 4 to conclude c c theorem 4 28 an fcp extension r s is a extension if and only if the following conditions hold 1 r r r r r t r r and t r r r are extensions the last condition being equivalent to t r r r is arithmetic 2 for each t u v r r such that t u and t v are minimal of different types then t uv is a b 2 extension proof assume that r s is a extension and then catenarian so that 2 holds by lemma 2 13 and corollary 3 12 moreover 1 holds because of proposition 4 7 and corollary 3 2 conversely assume that conditions 1 and 2 hold by proposition 4 25 we get that r t r r is a extension thanks to 1 and 2 and is catenarian since infra integral we now observe that 2 implies that r r is catenarian indeed any maximal chain from r to t r r has the same length r t r r k and any maximal chain from t r r to r has the same length t r r r l because t r r r is a extension by proposition 3 13 whence catenar ian now let r 0 r ri rn r be a maximal chain c such that ri ri 1 is a minimal extension for each i 0 n 1 set m k l if t r r c then t r r rk and c n m because r t r r and t r r r are catenarian now assume that t r r 6 c ac cording to lemma 4 27 2 implies that there exists a maximal chain c of r s containing t r r such that c c m it follows that any maximal chain of r r have length m and r r is catenarian now theorem 4 11 shows that r r is a extension which im plies at last that r s is a extension by theorem 4 5 34 g picavet and m picavet adding some assumptions in the statement of theorem 4 28 we get a simpler characterization of extensions corollary 4 29 let r s be a catenarian fcp extension then r s is a extension if and only if the following conditions hold 1 r r r r r t r r and t r r r are extensions the last condition being equivalent to t r r r is arithmetic 2 for each t u v r r such that t u and t v are minimal non inert of different types then t uv is a b 2 extension proof one implication is theorem 4 28 conversely in order to prove that r s is a extension it is enough to prove that 2 implies condition 2 of theorem 4 28 so let t u and t v be minimal extensions of different types with one of them inert since r s is a catenarian extension proposition 2 14 says that c t u 6 c t v and t uv t u v uv then t uv is a b 2 extension there fore r s is a extension corollary 4 30 a modular fcp extension r s is a extension if and only if t r r r is arithmetic proof if r s is a extension t r r r is arithmetic by corollary 4 29 conversely assume that t r r r is arithmetic then corollary 4 29 1 holds since r r r is modular and then a extension by theorem 4 18 let t u v r r be such that t u and t v are minimal non inert of different types then they are infra integral and so is t uv which is also modular it follows that t uv 2 by theorem 4 18 so that t uv t u v uv by 23 theorem 6 1 5 therefore t uv is a b 2 extension to conclude r s is a extension by corollary 4 29 5 examples the preceding section shows that we are lacking of a characterization of arbitrary subintegral extensions except those of theorem 4 18 which says that an infra integral fcp extension is a extension if and only if it is modular this last condition being unsatisfactory in this section we give examples of subintegral extensions with various properties we also characterize some special types of fcp extensions that are extensions proposition 5 1 let r s be an fcp subintegral extension as sume that r s m 6 mm for any m msupp s r then r s is a extension extensions 35 proof according to proposition 3 6 we may assume first that r m is a local ring such that m 6 r s and after considering the factor ring r r s so that r s 0 with r which is a local artinian ring by 6 theorem 4 2 and not a field first assume that r m is infinite then 6 proposition 5 15 asserts that r s is chained and then a extension by proposition 3 11 assume now that r m is finite and so is r because artinian 6 lemma 5 11 set r r x s s x and m mr x then r is a local artinian ring with maximal ideal m which has the same index of nilpotency as m so that r is not a field r m is infinite and r s 0 then the first part of the proof says that r s is a extension and so is r s by proposition 3 10 since a extension r s is modular proposition 3 13 a first approach consists in exhibiting conditions that imply the distributivity of a modular extension for a distributive fcp extension r s and its loewy series si ni 0 see the definition before corollary 5 3 25 proposition 3 8 says that si si 1 is boolean for each i 0 n we begin with the characterization of boolean extensions in the light of 24 proposition 3 5 we first consider extensions r s over a local ring proposition 5 2 let r s be a boolean fcp extension where r m is a local ring then r s is a extension if and only if either r s is minimal or an infra integral extension in fact b 2 proof let r s be a boolean fcp extension by 24 theorem 3 30 one of the following conditions is satisfied 1 r s is a minimal extension 2 there exist u t r s such that r t is minimal ramified r u is minimal decomposed and r s r t u s 3 r s is a boolean t closed extension in case 1 r s is a extension by proposition 3 11 in case 2 s tu r s 2 and r s is a b 2 extension because t 6 u in particular r s is infra integral since s tu t sr then theorem 4 16 implies that r s is a extension to sum up a boolean infra integral extension is always a extension in case 3 proposition 4 7 shows that r s is a extension if and only if r s is chained but a chain is boolean if and only if it is minimal by 24 example 3 3 1 then we recover case 1 in 25 we studied the loewy series si ni 0 associated to an fcp ring extension r s defined as follows in 25 definition 3 1 the socle 36 g picavet and m picavet of the extension r s is s r s a aa the product of the atoms of r s and the loewy series of the extension r s is the chain si ni 0 defined by induction s 0 r s 1 s r s and for each i 0 such that si 6 s we set si 1 s si s of course since r s has fcp there is some integer n such that sn 1 6 sn sn 1 s we said that r s is a p extension if r s is pinched at the chain si n 1 i 1 25 definition 3 19 corollary 5 3 a distributive fcp p extension r s with loewy series si ni 0 is a extension if and only if si si 1 is locally either minimal or an infra integral b 2 extension for each 0 i n 1 proof by 25 proposition 3 8 si si 1 is boolean for each 0 i n 1 because r s is distributive since r s is a p extension r s is pinched at the chain si n 1 i 1 then r s is a extension if and only if si si 1 is a extension for each 0 i n 1 by corollary 3 5 to end propositions 3 6 and 5 2 show that si si 1 is a extension if and only if si si 1 is locally a extension if and only if si si 1 is locally either minimal or an infra integral b 2 extension proposition 5 4 a locally unbranched distributive fcp extension r s is a extension if and only if it is arithmetic proof if r s is arithmetic then r s is a extension by propo sition 3 11 conversely assume that r s is a extension according to proposition 3 6 there is no harm to assume that r m is a local ring we begin to show that r r is chained we may assume r 6 r since r s is distributive so is r r the assumption yields that r is local as any element of r r set t r r t r r because r s is unbranched proposition 2 10 then corollary 4 12 shows that r r r t t r with t r chained now assume that r 6 t if si ni 0 is the loewy series of r t then si si 1 is a boolean extension for each i 0 n 1 according to 25 proposition 3 8 but si si 1 is also a extension with si a local ring for each i 0 n 1 now si si 1 is necessarily minimal ramified because r t is subintegral see the conditions of 24 theorem 3 30 in the proof of proposition 5 2 an easy induction shows that r t is chained since s 0 r s 1 is minimal r t has only one atom which is s 1 and so has any subextension si t for each i 0 n 1 whence r t is chained now r s r t t r r s according to lemma 2 4 because there does not exist extensions 37 some v r s r r r s since v r r but r s is also chained because r being local 6 theorem 6 10 implies that r s is chained to conclude r s is chained we saw in theorem 4 16 that an infra integral extension of length 2 is a extension the next proposition characterizes extensions of length 2 proposition 5 5 a length 2 extension r s is a extension except when the three following conditions are together verified msupp s r 1 r s is t closed and r s 3 proof we use the characterization of ring extensions of length 2 de scribed in 23 theorem 6 1 and keep only cases involving extension a ring extension r s is of length 2 if and only if one of the following conditions hold 1 supp s r 2 supp s r max r and r s 4 in this case for each m supp s r rm sm is minimal so that r s is arithmetic and then a extension by proposi tion 3 11 2 supp s r 2 supp s r 6 max r and r s 3 3 r s is a non integral m crucial extension and r s 3 4 r s is an integral m crucial extension such that tsr 6 r s and r s 3 in cases 2 3 and 4 r s is chained and then a extension by proposition 3 11 5 r s an infra integral m crucial extension such that sr 6 r s and either r s 3 or r s m with r s 4 6 r s is a subintegral m crucial extension of length 2 with either r s 3 or r s r m 3 7 r s is a seminormal infra integral m crucial extension such that r s 5 in cases 5 6 and 7 r s is infra integral and then a extension by theorem 4 16 8 r s is a t closed integral m crucial extension of length 2 so that m r s and r m s m is a field extension according to proposition 4 7 a t closed extension r s is a extension if and only ifr s is arithmetic if and only ifr m s m is chained form msupp s r but msupp s r 1 so that r m s m is chained for m msupp s r if and only if r s is chained if and only if r s 3 38 g picavet and m picavet to sum up a ring extension r s of length 2 is a extension except when r s is a t closed integral extension such that msupp s r 1 and r s 3 corollary 5 6 a b 2 extension is a extension except if it is t closed proof let r s be a b 2 extension that is r s 2 and r s 4 according to the characterization of length 2 extensions recalled in the proof of proposition 5 5 r s 4 happens in the following cases of this proof 1 and then r s is a extension 5 and r s is a extension in the t closed case when r s is a extension r s is chained so that r s 3 6 4 when r s 2 we now consider the properties for pointwise minimal extensions a ring extension r s is pointwise minimal if r r t is minimal for each t s r we characterized these extensions in a joint work with cahen in 3 the properties of pointwise minimal extensions r s allow to assume that r m is a local ring in 3 theorems 3 2 and 5 4 and proposition 3 5 we gave the different conditions for an extension r s to be pointwise minimal firstly a pointwise minimal extension is either integral or integrally closed and in this last case is minimal as minimal extensions are extensions we need only to consider pointwise minimal integral extensions which are not minimal that we describe as follows let r s be an integral extension such that r m is a local ring and which is not minimal then r s is a pointwise minimal extension if and only if m r s and one of the following condition is satisfied r m z 2 z and s m r m n for some integer n 3 in this case r s is seminormal infra integral m max s c r m p a prime integer and r m s m is a purely inseparable extension where xp r for each x s in this case r s is t closed r s is subintegral with max s n such that x 2 m for each x n max s n is such that x 2 m for each x n r r n s c r m p a prime integer and xp r for each x s in this case the spectral map of r s is bijective proposition 5 7 a pointwise minimal fcp extension r s over the local ring r m is a extension if and only if one of the following conditions holds 1 r s is minimal 2 r s is seminormal infra integral with max s 3 3 r s is subintegral with n 2 m where max s n extensions 39 proof since we have recalled just before the characterization of point wise minimal extensions r s we examine for each case a necessary and sufficient condition in order that r s be a extension so in the following we assume that r s is a pointwise minimal extension if r s is integrally closed r s is minimal and then a extension and we recover case 1 if r s is not integrally closed then r s is a integral extension if r s is minimal then r s is a extension and we recover case 1 if r s is a integral extension which is not minimal then r s satisfies one of conditions and moreover m r s in case we have r m z 2 z and s m r m n for some integer n 3 in this case r s is seminormal infra integral and by corollary 4 20 r s is a extension if and only if vs ms 3 for anym msupp s r which is equivalent since r m is a local ring to max s 3 but max s 2 implies that r s is minimal a contradiction to sum up if r s is seminormal infra integral non minimal then r s is a extension if and only if max s 3 which gives case 2 the condition is not involved for a t closed non minimal extension r s where r m is a local ring since it is chained by proposition 4 7 and so is r m s m in fact in this case r m s m is chained if and only if r m s m is minimal assume that the contrary holds then r m s m is a non minimal chain satisfying condition let s r m s m be such that r m s is minimal which implies that s 6 s m let x s m s so that xp r m giving r m r m x is minimal with s 6 r m x a contradiction it follows that r s needs to be a minimal extension and we recover case 1 if case holds r s is subintegral with max s n such that x 2 m for each x n in particular r x r rx for each x n we claim that r s is a extension if and only if n 2 m but n 2 m if and only if xy m for each x y n according to proposition 3 1 r s is a extension if and only if r s t r s r t for all s t s since r s is subintegral the isomorphism r m s n shows that s r n assume that r s is a extension and let x y n r n m then r r x is minimal ramified by theorem 2 3 because x 2 m and xm m for the same reason r r y is minimal ramified let p be the maximal ideal of r x if r x r y it follows that x y n r x p so that xy p 2 m assume r x 6 r y then xy r x y r x r y r rx ry so that xy a bx cy 40 g picavet and m picavet with a b c r then a xy bx cy r n m by we have a bx y x c if c 6 m then c 6 n which leads to c x is a unit in r x and in s it follows that y a bx x c 1 in s since a bx x c 1 r x we get y r x a contradiction then c m and cy m because m r s a similar proof shows that bx m giving xy m so that n 2 m conversely assume thatn 2 m we claim that r s t r s r t for all s t s it is enough to prove that st r s r t for all s t s since s r n we can write s x and t y with r and x y n in particular xy n 2 m but st y x xy y x xy t s xy r s r t to conclude r s is a extension we do not consider the case for the following reason an exten sion verifying cannot be a extension because it is not catenarian there exist two minimal extensions r r x and r r y with for instance r r x ramified r r y inert and m r s see proposition 2 15 in fact y s r n we saw in proposition 5 7 that in the seminormal infra integral case we deal with extensions of the form r m r m 3 we are going to look at infra integral extensions of the type r rn lemma 5 8 let r be an artinian ring and n an integer with n 1 if r rn is a extension then n 3 proof since rn m rm n for any maximal ideal m of r we may assume that r is a local ring by proposition 3 6 set s rn and t sr then r s is fcp infra integral by 21 proposition 1 4 with max s n and t s n 1 by 6 lemma 5 4 using corollary 4 20 we get that n 3 proposition 5 9 let r be an absolutely flat ring then r rn is a extension if and only if n 3 proof by proposition 3 6 we may assume that r is local so that r is a field then 21 proposition 1 4 shows that r rn is an infra integral seminormal fcp extension by proposition 4 20 r rn is a extension if and only if r rn 2 if and only if n 3 according to 21 proposition 1 4 when r is not reduced and n 3 there is a subintegral part r r 3 r of r r 3 so that we cannot use corollary 4 20 we next give an example of a extension r r 3 where r is an artinian local and non reduced ring which is not a field moreover r r 3 has fcp and is infra integral by the above extensions 41 reference we leave the easy but tedious calculations of this example to the reader example 5 10 set r z 2 z t t 2 z 2 z t where t is the class of t in r then r is an artinian local ring which is not reduced and whose maximal ideal m rt 6 0 is such that m 2 0 moreover r m z 2 z 2 let b e 1 e 2 e 3 be the canonical basis of r 3 according to 21 proposition 2 8 s r 3 r r n r e 1 e 2 e 3 rte 1 rte 2 for instance where n m m m rte 1 rte 2 rte 3 is the maximal ideal of the local ring s since max r 3 3 we get s r 3 2 according to 6 lemma 5 4 so that s r 3 is a extension by corollary 4 20 and r s lr n m by 6 lemma 5 4 but mn 0 yields lr n m lr m n m dimr m m m m m 2 thanks to 17 corollary 2 of proposition 24 page 66 it follows that r s 2 and r r 3 4 always by 6 lemma 5 4 in particular theorem 4 16 shows that r s is a extension hence from proposition 4 25 we deduce that r r 3 is a extension if and only if t uv 2 for each t u v r r 3 such that t u is minimal ramified and t v is minimal decomposed to find such extensions we are going to determine all elements of r r 3 for each i 1 2 3 set xi tei so that r xi r rtei is a local ring with maximal ideal ni rtei rt ej el for j l 6 i and j 6 l then r r x 1 r x 2 r x 3 s r s with the r xi s all distinct so that r s 3 then 23 theorem 6 1 says that r s 5 because r s is subintegral in particu lar r s r r x 1 r x 2 r x 3 s moreover s r 3 5 be cause s r 3 is seminormal infra integral indeed r r 3 is infra integral a short calculation shows that there does not exist any y r 3 such that r r y is minimal decomposed by defini tion of s r 3 r for each i 1 2 3 the only minimal ramified ex tension starting from r xi is r xi s for each i 1 2 3 set ri r ei r rei r xi eir xi we get that r xi ri is minimal decomposed and another calculation shows that this is the only minimal decomposed extension starting from r xi it follows that the maximal ideals of ri are mi m rei ni eir xi and m i m r 1 ei by definition of s there does not exist any y r 3 such that s s y is minimal ramified moreover for each i 1 2 3 we have s sri r 3 with sri r rei rtej rtel for j l 6 i and j 6 l since s r 3 is seminormal infra integral then sri r 3 ri because ri sri is minimal ramified use sri ri tej with i 6 j for instance and ri sri is the only minimal ramified extension 42 g picavet and m picavet starting from ri in particular s r 3 s sr 1 sr 2 sr 3 r 3 be cause s r 3 5 as we have seen just above we claim that there does not exist any y r 3 such that ri ri y is minimal decomposed if the contrary holds then ri y r 3 is minimal ramified contradicting 8 lemma 17 because mr 3 m m m is a radical ideal of r 3 containing 0 r r 3 to sum up the only minimal extensions of r are the r xi for a given i the only minimal extensions of r xi are ri and s the only minimal extension of ri is sri and the only minimal extensions of s are the sri at last sri r 3 is minimal for each i then we get the following commutative diagram corresponding to only one i 1 2 3 where r resp d indicates a minimal ramified resp decomposed extension ri d r r r r xi sri d r 3 r d s to conclude the only extensions such that t u is minimal ramified and t v is minimal decomposed are gotten for t r xi u s and v ri for each i 1 2 3 since uv sri and t uv r xi sri 2 we get that r r 3 is a extension by proposi tion 4 25 as we claimed before in the context of extensions of the form r rn for a positive integer n we now consider extensions of the form r r t where t is either idempotent or nilpotent of index 2 we recall that a ring r is called a spir if r is a principal ideal ring with a nonzero prime ideal m such that m is nilpotent of index p 0 proposition 5 11 an extension r r t where t is either idem potent or nilpotent of index 2 and such that r is a spir is an fip extension proof set s r t if t is either idempotent or nilpotent of index 2 then s is a finitely generated r module moreover r r s is an artinian ring because r is a spir then r s has fcp by 6 theorem 4 2 in both cases we can write t 2 rt 0 with either r 0 or r 1 this implies t 3 rt 2 0 then r r t is an t elementary extension 18 definition 1 1 and 18 proposition 2 18 shows that r r s s r s can be identified with r r s r r s x x 2 r x where r is the class of r in r r s but r s is a extension if and only if r r s s r s is extensions 43 a extension by proposition 3 6 then there is no harm to assume that r s 0 so that s r t r rt r x x 2 rx with r 1 0 since r is a spir r m is an artinian local ring and m rt is a maximal ideal of s lying above m if m 0 then r is a field and either s r 2 or s r x x 2 in both cases r s is a minimal extension decomposed when r 1 and ramified when r 0 and then a extension if m 6 0 then m is nilpotent and principal let n be its index of nilpotency so that mn 0 with mn 1 6 0 set m rx we begin by showing a result that holds for both values of r for k nn set rk r m ks r rxkt which is obviously a local ring with maximal ideal mk m m ks rx rxkt in particular for k n we have mk 1 mrk and rk rk 1 x kt set yk x kt and c rk k nn so that rk rk 1 yk next we show that c is a finite maximal chain observe that y 2 k x 2 kt 2 x 2 krt rk 1 mk 1 yk rx rxk 1 t xkt rxk 1 t rx 2 k 1 rt mk 1 and lrk 1 mk mk 1 lrk 1 mk 1 mk mk 1 dimr m mk mk 1 1 since mk mk 1 rx kt it follows that rk 1 rk is minimal ramified by 21 theorem 1 1 therefore c is a finite maximal chain and r r 1 is subintegral now we intend to prove that r r 1 c assume that the contrary holds so that there exists some u r r 1 c since rk nk 1 is a decreasing chain going from r 1 to r there exists some k nn 1 such that u rk with u 6 rk 1 moreover r s is an fcp extension since u 6 rk there exists v u rk so that v rk is minimal in particular v is a local ring let n be its maximal ideal then n v rk max v which is also an ideal of rk since r v is subintegral we get that v r n then m n implies mk 1 mrk nrk n so that rk 1 r mk 1 r n v rk which leads to v rk 1 then u rk 1 a contradiction therefore r r 1 c to show that r s is a extension we split the proof in two cases according to the value of r assume that r 1 it follows that we are reduced to show that r r 2 s is a extension according to 21 proposition 1 4 r r 2 is an infra integral fcp extension and setting t sr 21 proposition 2 8 says that t r m m r ms r 1 since max s 2 it follows that r 1 s is minimal decomposed by 6 lemma 5 4 proposition 4 25 asserts that r s is a extension if and only if the following 44 g picavet and m picavet statements hold r r 1 is a extension 1 r 1 s is a extension 2 and for eachw u v r s such thatw u is minimal ramified and w v is minimal decomposed w uv 2 3 since r 1 s is minimal 2 is satisfied we have proved above that r r 1 c is a finite maximal chain and then is a extension to show 3 we prove that there do not exist w u v r s such that w u is minimal ramified andw v is minimal decomposed assume that the contrary holds then in particular 2 max w 1 max v max s 2 implies that max v 2 assume first that w 6 r r 1 r 1 s and set w w r 1 r r 1 with w 6 w so that w w is seminormal infra integral with max w 2 but 2 max v max w 1 3 a contradiction it follows that w r r 1 r 1 s if w r 1 s then w u s together with w u minimal ramified leads to a contradiction then w r r 1 which implies u r r 1 but max v 2 max s implies that either v s which is impossible since v uv s or v s is subintegral in this case there exists v r s such that v s is minimal ramified now 8 lemma 17 gives that ms is not a radical ideal of s a contradiction with ms m m to conclude 3 is an invalid statement and r s is a extension when r 1 moreover r s has fip by 21 corollary 2 5 because r has finitely many ideals assume now that r 0 then s r t r 1 t where t 2 0 and m 1 t rxt rxt 2 rxt m 1 show that r 1 s is minimal ramified in fact r s r r 1 s it is enough to use the proof showing that r r 1 is a maximal chain with k 0 setting r 0 s and m 0 m rt since r s is chained it is a extension and has fip because it has fcp in the same spirit as the previous proposition we get the following result proposition 5 12 let r s be an fcp subintegral extension where r m is a local artinian ring so that s n is also a local ring let n 0 be the index of nilpotency of m set rk r m ks for any k 0 n with r 0 s and rn r assume that n 2 ms and that r s is pinched at rk n 1 k 1 then r s is a extension proof for each k 1 n set mk m mks and m 0 n mimicking the proof of proposition 5 11 we get that rk mk is a local ring such that mk 1 mrk rk 1 rk for each k 0 n 1 since r s is subintegral so are each rk 1 rk then rk r mk r m ks we begin to show that each rk 1 rk extensions 45 is pointwise minimal for k 1 n 1 let x a y rk rk 1 a r y mks so that rk 1 x rk 1 y for k 0 we choose y n ms then mk 1 y mk 1 by which also holds for k 0 moreover y 2 m 2 k m 2 mk 1 s m 2 ks mk 1 shows that rk 1 rk 1 y is minimal so that rk 1 rk is pointwise minimal this also holds for k 0 since n 2 ms in particular this shows that r 1 s is a extension by proposition 5 7 the same proposition shows that rk 1 rk is a extension becausem 2 k mk 1 as we have just seen then r s is a extension because r s is pinched at rk n 1 k 1 according to corollary 3 5 proposition 5 13 an fip subintegral extension k s over the field k is a extension if either 1 k or 2 k s is chained proof we use 1 theorem 3 8 together with the fact that k s is fip subintegral this last condition implies that either a k with s a finite dimensional vector space such that k s is subintegral or b k with s k for some s which satisfies 3 0 if 2 holds then k s is a extension by proposition 3 11 assume now 1 that is k since k s is subintegral s is a local ring with maximal ideal m k k 2 if 2 0 it follows that k s is minimal ramified and then a extension if 2 6 0 6 lemma 5 4 shows that k s lk m dimk m 2 hence k s is a extension according to theorem 4 16 remark 5 14 even if k then k x and we may use 1 of proposition 5 13 for the extension k x s x because of proposition 3 10 then k s is a extension if so is k x s x but in order to use 1 we need that k x s x has fip this last property being equivalent to k s is an fip chained extension according to 20 theorem 4 2 corollary 5 15 let r n i 1 ki be a product of infinite fields and r s be an fip subintegral extension then r s is a extension proof proposition 3 15 says that for each i nn there exists ring extensions ki si such that s n i 1 si moreover r s is a subintegral extension if and only if so is ki si for each i nn see the proof of proposition 3 15 conclude with proposition 5 13 here is an example of an infra integral extension of number field orders whose length is 2 its property is proved by checking the hypotheses of proposition 4 25 and in particular the condition 2 of proposition 4 25 46 g picavet and m picavet example 5 16 in 10 example 3 7 5 el fadil chillali and akhar raz consider the quartic number field k defined by the irreducible poly nomial x 4 22 x 66 let s be the ring of integers of k it is shown in this example that 3 s p 1 p 3 2 where p 1 and p 2 are the maximal ideals of s lying above 3 z set r z 3 s we are going to prove that r s is a extension since k q 4 the fundamental formula 27 theorem 1 page 193 gives 4 g i 1 eifi where g is the decomposition number of 3 z in the extension q k ei is the ramification index of pi and fi is the inertial degree of pi it follows that g 2 e 1 1 e 2 3 and fi 1 for each i observe that s pi k for each i where k z 3 z in particular r s is an infra integral extension because 3 s r s is a maximal ideal of r and r 3 s z 3 z k s pi for each i where p 1 and p 2 are the only maximal ideals of s containing r s 3 s set w sr then w 6 s because vs 3 s p 1 p 2 and 3 s max r so that r s is not subintegral since vs 3 s 2 it follows that w s is minimal decomposed according to theorem 2 3 and proposition 2 10 and then a extension hence the second part of condition 1 of proposition 4 25 is satisfied now 3 s p 1 p 3 2 w s p 1 p 2 implies w s p 1 p 2 by the same reference since w s max w with z 3 z z p 1 p 2 p 1 p 2 w p 1 p 2 s pi z 3 z for each i 1 2 this shows that w z p 1 p 2 moreover 3 s r w let n be the maximal ideal of the local ring w 3 s because r s 3 s 6 lemma 5 4 gives r w r 3 s w 3 s lk n dimk n dimk w 3 s dimk s 3 s 4 so that r w 2 it follows that r w is a extension by theorem 4 16 and condition 1 of proposition 4 25 is satisfied in particular r s 3 since r s is infra integral we show that condition 2 of proposition 4 25 is also satisfied set u 1 r p 1 p 2 2 v 1 r p 3 2 v 2 r p 2 2 and u 2 r p 1 p 2 we have the following commutative diagram with w u 2 so that r w 2 and r s 3 u 1 u 2 r s v 1 v 2 since r s p 1 p 3 2 for any t r s we have p 1 p 32 t s so that p 1 and p 2 are the only maximal ideals of s that may contain t s moreover t s p 1 p 2 for some 0 1 0 1 2 3 extensions 47 because s is a dedekind domain in particular if t s is minimal it is either ramified and in this case m 2 t s m for some maximal ideal m of s this leads to t s p 2 2 and t v 2 if t s is decomposed the only possible case is t s p 1 p 2 and t w u 2 let t u v r s be such that t u is minimal ramified and t v is minimal decomposed since r s 3 we may have t uv 2 only if t r and uv s we are going to show that v v 1 of course the diagram shows that r v 1 is minimal and p 32 v 1 s is a maximal ideal of v 1 since p 2 is the only maximal ideal of s lying above v 1 s it follows that v 1 s is subintegral now r v 1 is minimal decomposed because if we suppose that the contrary holds then r s is subintegral a contradiction assume that there is another v r s such that r v is minimal decomposed there would be in v 1 v 3 maximal ideals lying above 3 s because r v 1 v 2 in this case with r v 1 v seminormal infra integral a contradiction since only 2 maximal ideals of s lie above 3 s then v 1 is the only v r s such that r v is minimal decomposed now let u r s be such that r u is minimal ramified so that there is only one maximal ideal n of u lying above 3 s r s since p 1 and p 2 lie above 3 s in r they both lie above n in u so that n p 1 p 2 it follows that np 3 2 p 1 p 42 p 1 p 32 which shows that r uv 1 2 according to proposition 2 15 since condition 2 of proposition 4 25 is also satisfied r s is a extension we now introduce a property linked to extensions and to 13 see proposition 3 1 let r s be a ring extension we say that r s is a extension if r x r y r x y for any x y s such that r x 6 r y proposition 5 17 let r s be a ring extension 1 r s is a extension if and only if n i 1 r xi r n i 1 xi for any x 1 xn s and any integer n such that r xi 6 j i r xj for any i nn i and for any i nn 2 if r s is a extension then r s is a extension 3 if r s is an fcp extension then r s is simple proof 1 one implication is obvious conversely assume that r s is a extension that is r x r y r x y for any x y s such that r x 6 r y and let x 1 xn s be such that r xi 6 j i r xj for any i nn i and for any i nn we show that n i 1 r xi r n i 1 xi by induction on n the induction hypothesis is obviously satisfied for n 2 let n 2 and set y n 1 i 1 xi so 48 g picavet and m picavet that n i 1 xi y xn assume that the induction hypothesis holds for n 1 it follows that r y n 1 i 1 r xi with r xn 6 r y then r n i 1 xi r y xn r y r xn by the hypothesis which leads to r n i 1 xi n 1 i 1 r xi r xn n i 1 r xi then it holds for any n 2 if r s is a extension then r x r y r x y for any x y s such that r x 6 r y so that r x r y r s for any x y s which shows that r s is a extension by proposition 3 1 since x y r x r y implies r x y r x r y r x y 3 recall that an extension r s is called strongly affine if each element of r s is a finite type r algebra assume that r s is an fcp extension then r s is strongly affine by 6 proposition 3 12 so that s r x 1 xn for some x 1 xn s we can choose the xi s as a minimal generating set so that r xi 6 j i r xj for any i nn i and for any i nn moreover r s is a extension by 2 then we get s n i 1 r xi by proposition 3 1 so that s r n i 1 xi and r s is simple proposition 5 18 a chained extension is a extension proof let r s be a chained extension and let x y s be such that r x 6 r y since r x and r y are comparable assume r x r y so that x r y which implies r x y r y moreover r x y and r x are comparable if r x y r x then x y r x which gives y r x a contradiction it follows that r x r x y and then x r x y which gives y r x y then r x y r y r y r x and r s is a extension corollary 5 19 a pru fer extension is a extension proof let r s be a pru fer extension and so is rm sm for any m msupp s r let m msupp s r according to 22 proposition 1 2 rm sm is chained indeed rm sm is pru fer for each m supp s r by 22 proposition 1 1 and since rm is local there exists p spec rm such that sm rm p p psm with rm p a valuation domain with quotient field sm p then rm p sm p is chained and so is rm sm it follows that rm sm is a extension by proposition 5 18 let x y s then rm x rm y rm x y since this holds for any m msupp s r we get that r x r y r x y so that r s is a extension example 5 20 1 let r t and r u be two minimal extensions such that s tu exists if r s satisfies one of the two following conditions then r s is a extension extensions 49 a c r t 6 c r u b r t and r u are two minimal infra integral extensions of different types such that r s 2 in both cases we can set t r x and u r y if case a holds let m c r t and n c r u then um rm and tn rn imply t u m tm sm and t u n un sn so that t u s since x y 6 t u we have s r x y r x y because r s r t u s by proposition 2 15 then r x r y r x y finally any z s is such that r z r t u s so that r s is a extension if case b holds we can assume m c r t c r u if not then a holds now r s 2 implies r s r t u s by 23 theorem 6 1 5 because r s 4 we still have s r x y because x y 6 r t u but in this case we can choose xy m and s r rx ry by proposition 2 15 the end of the proof of case a still holds giving that r s is a extension 2 proposition 5 17 asserts that a extension is a extension the converse does not hold let r s be a non simple fcp extension then r s is not a extension by proposition 5 17 take r z 2 z and s r 3 according to proposition 5 7 r s is a pointwise minimal extension which is not minimal in particular r s is not simple by the definition of a pointwise minimal extension then r s is a extension which is not a extension references 1 d d anderson d e dobbs and b mullins the primitive element theo rem for commutative algebras houston j math 25 1999 603 623 2 n bourbaki alge bre
