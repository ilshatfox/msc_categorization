poset r s of r subalgebras of s is called catenarian if it verifies the jordan ho lder property this property has already been studied by dobbs and shapiro for finite extensions of fields we investigate this property for arbitrary ring extensions showing that many type of extensions are catenarian we reduce the char acterization of catenarian extensions to the case of field extensions an unsolved question at that time 1 introduction in this paper we consider the category of commutative and unital rings whose epimorphisms will be involved if r s is a ring extension we denote by r s the set of all r subalgebras of s and set r s r s r s with a similar definition for r s or r s a lattice is a poset l such that every pair a b l has a supremum and an infimum we will consider for an extension r s the poset r s which is a complete lattice where the supremum of any non void subset is the compositum which we call product from now on and denote by when necessary and the infimum of any non void subset is the intersection as a general rule an extension r s is said to have some property of lattices if r s has this property any undefined material is explained at the end of the section or in the next sections we only consider extensions of finite length in a sense defined below and called fcp extensions these extensions r s are the extensions such that r s is an artinian and noetherian lattice dobbs and shapiro published a paper in which they examine finite field extensions with the catenarian property 9 these extensions are such that the lattice k l associated to a field

these extensions is lacking and actually is an open problem that we did not try to solve our aim is to consider arbitrary fcp extensions that are catenarian i e that have the jordan ho lder property surprisingly we are able to give substantial positive results some types of ring extensions are natu rally catenarian for example in the fcp context distributive exten sions length 2 extensions 19 pru fer extensions 18 some pointwise extensions 2 infra integral extensions are catenarian the catenarian property has a good stability with respect to the usual constructions of commutative algebra an fcp ring extension r s is catenarian if and only if r r is catenarian where r is the integral closure of r in s however there are some ring extensions namely the t closed extensions whose definition is given in the sequel that are catenarian if and only if some associated residual field extensions are catenarian as t closed extensions factorize any ring extension because any extension r s has a t closure tsr of r in s the reader may understand that a complete characterization is unavoidable unless the same problem is solved for fields actually some results are valid under the hypothesis t sr s is catenarian for example if r s r tsr tsr s we give some complements on finite field extensions that are cate narian catenarian galois extensions have been characterized in 9 another lattice property is involved the supersolvable property a property considered by dobbs and shapiro in the context of galois group of a field extension providing finite galois extensions that are catenarian supersolvable lattices are defined in 24 example 3 14 4 for galois extensions the two notions coincide for arbitrary ring extensions this is not the case we must add some special condition of modularity to get catenarity this paper is the continuation of our earlier papers on lattice proper ties of ring extensions 20 and 21 where we considered boolean ring extensions and loewy series of a ring extension we have a forthcoming paper about distributive extensions 2 some material of commutative algebra 2 1 some conventions and notation a local ring is here what is called elsewhere a quasi local ring as usual spec r and max r are the set of prime and maximal ideals of a ring r for an extension r s and an ideal i of r we write vs i p spec s i p we denote by r p the residual field rp prp at p the support of an r module e is suppr e p spec r ep 6 0 and catenarian extensions 3 msuppr e suppr e max r when r s is an extension we will set suppr t r supp t r and suppr s t supp s t for each t r s unless otherwise specified if r s is a ring extension and p spec r then sp is both the localization sr p as a ring and the localization at p of the r module s we denote by r s the conductor of r s the integral closure of r in s is denoted by r s or by r if no confusion can occur finally x is the cardinality of a set x denotes proper inclusion and for a positive integer n we set nn 1 n the characteristic of an integral domain k is denoted by c k we now describe the material we use in this paper 2 2 results on fcp extensions the extension r s is said to have fip for the finitely many intermediate algebras property or an fip extension if r s is finite we will say that r s is chained if r s is a chain that is a set of elements that are pairwise comparable with respect to inclusion we also say that the extension r s has fcp or is an fcp extension if each chain in r s is finite clearly each extension that satisfies fip must also satisfy fcp dobbs and the authors characterized fcp and fip extensions 5 our main tool are the minimal ring extensions a concept that was introduced by ferrand olivier 10 recall that an extension r s is called minimal if r s r s the key connection between the above ideas is that if r s has fcp then any maximal necessarily finite chain c of r subalgebras of s r r 0 r 1 rn 1 rn s with length c n results from juxtaposing n mini mal extensions ri ri 1 0 i n 1 an fcp extension is finitely generated and module finite if integral for any extension r s the length r s of r s is the supremum of the lengths of chains of r subalgebras of s notice that if r s has fcp then there does exist some maximal chain of r subalgebras of s with length r s 6 theorem 4 11 the following results are deeply involved in the sequel a ring exten sion r s defining s as an r module is called finite if the r module s is of finite type theorem 2 1 10 the ore me 2 2 and 8 proposition 4 6 1 a minimal extension is either finite or a flat epimorphism of finite type 2 a ring extension r s is minimal if and only if there is some m max r called the crucial maximal ideal of the exten sion and denoted by c r s such that rm sm is minimal 4 g picavet and m picavet and rp sp for each p spec r m in particular supp s r m proposition 2 2 5 corollary 3 2 suppose there exists a maximal chain r r 0 ri rn s of extensions where ri ri 1 is minimal with crucial ideal mi for instance suppose r s is an fcp extension then supp s r mi r i 0 n 1 recall that an extension r s is pru fer or a normal pair if r t is a flat epimorphism for each t r s 12 theorem 5 2 page 47 in 18 we called a minimal extension which is a flat epimorphism a pru fer minimal extension three types of integral minimal extensions exist characterized in the next theorem a consequence of the fun damental lemma of ferrand olivier so that there are four types of minimal extensions theorem 2 3 5 theorem 2 2 let r t be an extension and m r t then r t is minimal and finite if and only if m max r and one of the following three conditions holds a inert case m max t and r m t m is a minimal field extension b decomposed case there exist m 1 m 2 max t such that m m 1 m 2 and the natural maps r m t m 1 and r m t m 2 are both isomorphisms c ramified case there exists m max t such that m 2 m m t m r m 2 and the natural map r m t m is an isomorphism we recall here the crosswise exchange which will be used in the rest of the paper lemma 2 4 crosswise exchange 5 lemma 2 7 let r s and s t be minimal extensions m c r s n c s t and p n r be such that p 6 m then there is s r t such that r s is minimal of the same type as s t and p c r s and s t is minimal of the same type as r s and ms c s t moreover r t r s s t and rq s q tq for q max r m p the following material is needed for our study definition 2 5 an integral extension r s is called infra integral 15 if all its residual extensions r p s q withq spec s and p q r are isomorphisms an extension r s is called t closed cf 15 if the relations b s r r b 2 rb r b 3 rb 2 r imply b r the t closure tsr of r in s is the smallest element b r s catenarian extensions 5 such that b s is t closed and the greatest element b r s such that r b is infra integral integral closures and t closures play an a crucial role in the sequel the next proposition gives the link between these notions and the minimal extensions involved proposition 2 6 16 lemma 3 1 let there be an integral extension r s admitting a maximal chain c of r subextensions of s defined by r r 0 ri rn s where each ri ri 1 is minimal the following statements hold 1 r s is t closed if and only if each ri ri 1 is inert 2 r s is infra integral if and only if each ri ri 1 is either ramified or decomposed 3 if r is field and r s is t closed s is a field if 1 holds then spec s spec r is bijective proof the last result comes from theorem 2 3 and theorem 2 1 2 because they imply the bijectivity of spec ri 1 spec ri when ri ri 1 is inert the following situation is often met when controlling lattice prop erties of ring extensions we say that a property t of integral fcp t closed extensions r s is convenient if the following conditions are equivalent 1 r s satisfies t 2 rm sm satisfies t for any m msupp s r 3 r i s i satisfies t for any ideal i shared by r and s proposition 2 7 let r s be an integral hence finite t closed fcp extension and i r s then vr i msupp s r is finite and q vs i lying over p in r verifies q ps moreover if t is a convenient property the following conditions are equivalent 1 r s satisfies t 2 the residual extensions r p s q satisfy t for any q vs i and p q r 3 r p r p r s satisfies t for any p vr i 4 the field extension r p s q satisfies t for any q vs i and p q r proof since r s is an integral fcp extension r i is an artinian ring 5 theorem 4 2 and the extension is finite so that vr i supp s r msupp s r where the last equation is valid because r i is artinian actually i is an intersection of finitely many maximal 6 g picavet and m picavet ideals because the extension is seminormal 5 lemma 4 8 moreover for each p vr i there is a unique q vs i lying above p by proposition 2 6 1 in particular sq sp and s q sq qsq sp qsp sp prp because sp sq is a local ring with maximal ideal prp according to 6 lemma 3 17 this shows that prp rp sp psp qsq qsp since pmsm qm sm for any m max r p we get ps q to conclude s q r p rs which gives 2 3 because t is convenient r s satisfies t if and only ifrm sm satisfies t for any m msupp s r we have just seen that rm sm mrm which is an ideal shared by rm and sm fix p msupp s r using the second equivalence characterizing a con venient property and the equalities of we get that rp sp satisfies t if and only if r p rp prp sp prp s q satisfies t gathering these two equivalences we get that 1 is equivalent 2 moreover since r p rp prp r p and s q sq qsq s q we get 2 4 this proposition shows that in order to prove that a convenient property t holds for integral t closed fcp extensions it is enough to establish that this property holds for finite dimensional field extensions 3 first properties of catenarian extensions if r s is an fcp extension r s is a complete noetherian ar tinian lattice with r as the least element and s as the largest element we use lattice definitions and properties described in 13 in the context of a lattice r s some definitions and properties of lattices have the following formulations an element t of r s is an atom if and only if r t is a minimal extension we denote by a the set of atoms of r s a following dobbs and shapiro in 9 we say that an fcp extension r s is catenarian or graded if all maximal chains between r and s have the same length the jordan ho lder chain condition actually in lattice theory 22 theorem 1 12 and the definition just before a poset p is called graded if there is a function g p z for which a b g a g b with g b g a 1 if b covers a which is equivalent for an fcp extension to all maximal chain between two comparable elements have the same finite length therefore r s is catenarian if and only if r s is a graded lattice b distributive if intersection and product are each distributive with respect to the other actually each distributivity implies the other 13 exercise 5 page 33 catenarian extensions 7 we begin by giving some simple examples proposition 3 1 a chained extension of finite length is catenarian proof obvious proposition 3 2 11 corollary 14 page 62 a distributive lattice of finite length is catenarian proposition 3 3 let r s be an fcp extension then r s is catenarian if and only if so is each subextension t u of r s proof obvious proposition 3 4 a ring extension r s of length 2 is catenarian proof clear because any maximal chain of r s cannot be minimal and so is of length 2 we are going to look at the stability of catenarity under some usual constructions of commutative algebra proposition 3 5 let r s be an fcp extension j an ideal of s and i j r if r s is catenarian so is r i s j proof since catenarity still holds for any subextension it holds for r j s and also for r j j s j because of the lattice isomorphism r j s r j j s j defined by t 7 t j since j is a ideal shared by any element of r j s now r j j r i gives the result we remark that the converse may not hold let r s be an fcp extension j an ideal of s and i j r if r i s j is catenarian so is r j s use the lattice isomorphism of the proof of proposition 3 5 but if r r j is not catenarian then r s is not corollary 3 6 let r s be a ring extension the following state ments are equivalent 1 r s is catenarian 2 r i s i is catenarian for each ideal i shared by r and s 3 r i s i is catenarian for some ideal i shared by r and s proof 1 2 by proposition 3 5 obviously 2 3 and 3 1 because of the bijection r s r i s i recall that the idealization r m r m r m r m is a commutative ring whose operations are defined as follows r m s n r s m n and r m s n rs rn sm 8 g picavet and m picavet then 1 0 is the unit of r m and r r m is a ring mor phism defining r m as an r module so that we can identify any r r with r 0 proposition 3 7 let m be an s module then an fcp extension r s is catenarian if and only if so is r m s m proof since m is an s module it is also an r module and there is a ring extension r m s m set c r s obviously we have c m r m s m since r m c m r c and s m c m s c the following holds r m s m is catenarian r m c m s m c m is catenarian r c s c is catenarian r s is catenarian by corollary 3 6 the next proposition is needed in the last example of this section proposition 3 8 4 lemma iii 3 and 5 proposition 3 7 d let r s be a ring extension where r n i 1 ri is a cartesian product of rings for each i nn there are ring extensions ri si such that s n i 1 si each t r s is of the form t n i 1 ti where ti ri si for each i nn moreover r s has fcp if and only if so has ri si for each i nn proposition 3 9 let r s be an fcp extension where r i nn ri is a cartesian product of rings for each i nn there exists fcp ring extensions ri si such that s i nn si moreover r s is cate narian if and only if so is ri si for each i nn if these conditions hold then r s i nn ri si proof the first part of the statement is proposition 3 8 set r r s and ri ri si assume that r s is catenarian and so is any subextension of r s let ci ti j j ns be a maximal chain of ri si using the construction of proposition 3 8 and setting tj k nn tk j such that tk j rk for k 6 i and j ns we get a maximal chain c tj j ns of r ts since r ts is catenarian of length s any maximal chain of ri si leads by this construction to a maximal chain of r ts of length s and so is of length s ri then ri si is catenarian conversely assume that ri si is catenarian for each i nn let c tj j nr be a maximal chain of r s with tj 1 tj minimal for each j nr for each j nr set tj i nn ti j for a given j nr since tj 1 tj is minimal there exists a unique ij nn such that tij j 1 tij j is minimal and tk j 1 tk j for any k nn ij then cij tij j j nr is a maximal chain of rij sij with tij j 1 tij j catenarian extensions 9 minimal and either tij l 1 tij l or tij l 1 tij l minimal for l 6 j now looking at the elements of c and of the ci s we get that each minimal extension in c comes from only one minimal extension in some cij such that the corresponding jth extensions in the ck s for k 6 ij are trivial conversely fix some i nn and let ti j ti k be a minimal extension in ci with j k if k j 1 then ti j ti j 1 comes from tj tj 1 which is minimal if k j 1 then tj tk is not minimal but there exists j j k 1 such that ti j ti j ti j 1 ti k so that ti j ti j 1 comes from tj tj 1 which is still minimal any tj r s can be uniquely expressed as a product t 1 j tn j where ti j ri si for each i nn since any minimal extension tj tj 1 comes from a unique minimal extension tij j tij j 1 corresponding to a unique ij we get that c i nn ci i nn ri is a constant and r s is catenarian if these conditions hold then r s i nn ri si see 5 propo sition 3 7 d in fact there was a misprint in the quoted reference where one should replace with in the length formula 4 characterization of catenarian ring extensions the aim of this section is to characterize catenarian ring extensions some special extensions are catenarian proposition 4 1 a pru fer fcp extension is catenarian proof use 5 theorem 6 3 and proposition 6 12 the following theorem reduces the study to the charcterization of integral catenarian extensions theorem 4 2 an fcp extension r s is catenarian if and only if r r is catenarian proof one implication comes from proposition 3 3 conversely assume that r r is catenarian set r r m which is the length of any maximal chain from r to r and r s r which is the length of any maximal chain from r to s by proposition 4 1 let c be a maximal chain from r to s using the proof of 6 theorem 4 11 there exists a maximal chain c from r to s containing r with c c since c r r r s m r we get that all maximal chains from r to s have the same length and r s is catenarian the previous proposition shows that we can limit to characterize integral extensions before we show it is enough to deal with ring extensions r s where r is a local ring 10 g picavet and m picavet proposition 4 3 let r s be an fcp ring extension 1 if r s is integral then r s is catenarian if and only if rm sm is catenarian for each m msupp s r 2 if r s is an arbitrary fcp ring extension the following statements are equivalent a r s is catenarian b rm sm is catenarian for each m msupp s r c rp sp is catenarian for each p supp s r 3 in particular if r s is integral then r s m msupp s r rm sm proof we begin to prove the result for an integral extension since the integral case is involved in the proof of the general case 1 assume that r s is catenarian for some m msupp s r let c ti ni 0 and c t j mj 0 be two maximal chains of rm sm so that ti 1 ti is minimal for each i nn t j 1 t j is minimal for each j nm with t 0 t 0 rm and tn t m sm using 5 theorem 3 6 for each i nn there exists ri r s such that ri m ti and ri m rm for any m msupp s r m in particular ri 1 ri is minimal for each i nn by theorem 2 1 it follows that ri ni 0 is a maximal chain of r rn of length n in the same way we can build a maximal chain r j j 0 of r r m of length m such that r j m t j and r j m rm for any m msupp s r m but rn m tn sm t m r m m and rn m rm r m m for any m msupp s r m it follows that rn r m since r rn is catenarian by proposition 3 3 we get that m n so that c c and rm sm is catenarian conversely assume that rm sm is catenarian for each m msupp s r let c and c be two maximal chains of r s we denote by cm resp c m the chain deduced from c resp c by lo calization at m spec r and deletion of redundant elements so that cm and c m are maximal chains of rm sm and then cm c m from 6 lemma 4 5 we deduce that c m msupp s r cm m msupp s r c m c and r s is catenarian 2 according to theorem 4 2 and 1 we have a r r is catenarian rm rm is catenarian for each m msupp s r rp rp is catenarian for each p supp s r rp sp is catenarian for each p supp s r rm sm is catenarian for each m msupp s r 3 the equality comes from 6 proposition 4 6 catenarian extensions 11 proposition 4 4 let r s be a catenarian extension f r r a flat ring epimorphism and s r r s then r s is catenarian proof the proof is a consequence of the following facts let f r r be a flat epimorphism and q spec r lying over p in r then rp r q is an isomorphism moreover we have r r s q r q rp sp so that rp sp identifies to r q r r s q s q assume that r s is catenarian then so is rp sp for each p spec r by proposition 4 3 let q spec r and p f 1 q spec r since rp sp identifies to r q s q we get that r q s q is catenarian for each q spec r it follows that r s is catenarian by the same references given a ring r recall that its nagata ring r x is the localization r x t 1 r x of the ring of polynomials r x with respect to the multiplicatively closed subset t of all polynomials with content r in 7 theorem 32 dobbs and the authors proved that when r s is an extension whose nagata extension r x s x has fip the map r s r x s x defined by t t x is an order isomorphism in this case we have the following result proposition 4 5 let r s be an fcp extension whose nagata extension r x s x has fip then r s has fip and r s is catenarian if and only if r x s x is catenarian proof since r x s x has fip r s has fip and the map r s r x s x defined by t t x is an order isomorphism by 7 theorem 32 in particular any maximal chain c ri ni 0 of r s of length n is such that c ri ni 0 is a maximal chain of r x s x of length n conversely any maximal chain of r x s x of length n comes through from a maximal chain of r s of length n then the catenarity of r s is equivalent to the catenarity of r x s x by the way we recover the equality r s r x s x of 7 theorem 32 which always holds when r x s x has fip when looking at the previous proposition where r r x is a faithfully flat ring morphism we may ask if the statement of the above proposition is still satisfied when taking r r an arbitrary faithfully flat ring morphism instead of r r x which is faithfully flat the answer is no as shown at the end of the next section example 4 27 in 21 we studied the loewy series si ni 0 associated to an fcp ring extension r s defined as follows in 21 definition 3 1 the socle of the extension r s is s r s a aa and the loewy 12 g picavet and m picavet series of the extension r s is the chain si ni 0 defined by induction s 0 r s 1 s r s and for each i 0 such that si 6 s we set si 1 s si s of course since r s has fcp there is some integer n such that sn sn 1 s we introduced a property often involved in 21 an fcp extension r s with loewy series si ni 0 is said to satisfy the property p or is a p extension if r s n 1 i 0 si si 1 for such extensions the loewy series gives a catenarity criterion for instance we have a catenarian p extension which is not distributive in 21 example 3 20 set k q l k x where x 3 2 and ki k i i 2 3 6 then k l k k 1 k 2 k 3 l and the following diagram holds l k 1 k 2 k 3 k k l is a non distributive extension of length 2 but is catenarian moreover s k l l s 1 k l k s 1 and k l is a p extension proposition 4 6 let r s be an fcp p extension with loewy series si ni 0 then r s is catenarian if and only if si si 1 is catenar ian for each i 0 n 1 moreover r s n 1 i 0 si si 1 proof one implication is obvious because of proposition 3 3 con versely assume that each si si 1 is catenarian and set ni si si 1 let c rj mj 0 be a maximal chain of r s so that r 0 r rm s and rj rj 1 is minimal for each j 0 m 1 since r s is a p extension for each j 0 m 1 there is a unique ij 0 n 1 such that rj sij sij 1 so that any rj is comparable to any si we claim that for each i 0 n 1 there is a unique ji 0 m 1 such that si rji for i 1 n 1 set ji inf j 1 m 1 si rj so that si rji if si rji we are done assume that si rji by definition of ji we get that rji 1 6 si s so that rji 1 si rji a contradiction since rji 1 rji is minimal in particular rji 1 rji si 1 si ni 1 which leads to c m n i 1 rji 1 rji n i 1 si 1 si n i 1 ni 1 which is independent of c then any maximal chain of r s has the same length and r s is catenarian before characterizing catenarian integral fcp extensions we begin to look at special simpler cases proposition 4 7 an infra integral fcp extension is catenarian catenarian extensions 13 proof 5 lemma 5 4 corollary 4 8 let r be a commutative ring and n 2 a positive integer then r rn is catenarian proof r rn is infra integral 17 proposition 1 4 proposition 4 9 let r s be an integral fcp extension such that t sr s is catenarian let m r tsr and r tsr s the following statements hold 1 any maximal chain containing tsr has length m r 2 if r s r tsr tsr s then r s is catenarian proof proposition 4 7 ensures us that r tsr is catenarian if tsr r s then r s is catenarian assume that tsr 6 r s 1 let c be a maximal chain of r s containing tsr set c 1 c r tsr and c 2 c tsr s since tsr c we get that c 1 is a maximal chain of r tsr and c 2 is a maximal chain of t sr s so that c c 1 c 2 m r 2 assume that r s r tsr tsr s let c ri ni 0 be a maximal chain of r s such that ri 1 ri is minimal for each i nn let k sup i nn ri r tsr in fact k 6 n because tsr 6 s then rk tsr rk 1 since rk rk 1 is minimal it follows that t sr rk c then 1 yields that c m r which shows that r s is catenarian lemma 4 10 let r t and t s be two minimal extensions such that r t is inert and t s is either decomposed or ramified i e non inert setting t tsr the following statements hold 1 if r t 6 t s then r t resp t s is minimal of the same type as t s resp r t and r s r t t s 2 if r t t s then r s 2 proof set m r t and n t s since r t is inert then m max t 1 if m 6 n then r t is a minimal extension of the same type as t s and t s is a minimal inert extension by the crosswise ex change lemma 2 4 indeed n r 6 m sincen r max r more over the crosswise exchange lemma says that r s r t t s 2 assume that m n so that m r s since r s is neither infra integral nor t closed we get that t 6 r s moreover r s has fcp by 5 theorem 4 2 then there exists r 1 r t such that r r 1 is minimal non inert with m r r 1 using 8 14 g picavet and m picavet proposition 7 1 or 7 4 we obtain two maximal chains of r tr 1 of different lengths so that r s 2 proposition 4 11 let r s be an integral fcp extension for any maximal chain c of r s there exists a maximal chain c of r s containing tsr such that c c in particular c c if and only if there exist u t v c such that u t is inert t v is minimal non inert and u t t v if these last conditions hold then t v r msupp tsr r and p tsr p vs u t msuppt s r s t sr proof let c be the maximal chain r r 0 ri rn s where ri 1 ri is minimal for each i nn if there exists some i such that ri t sr take c c assume that ri 6 tsr for each i 0 n in particular tsr 6 r s so that r s is neither t closed nor infra integral we claim that there exists some i such that ri 1 ri is inert and ri ri 1 is minimal non inert deny so that no inert extension is followed by a minimal non inert extension it follows that there exists k nn 1 such that rj rj 1 is not inert for j k and rj rj 1 is inert for j k then r rk is infra integral and rk s is t closed according to proposition 2 6 it follows that rk t sr a contradiction an applica tion of lemma 4 10 gives a maximal chain from ri 1 to ri 1 containing at less two minimal extensions and with first only minimal non inert extensions followed by only inert extensions repeating this construc tion until we have first only minimal non inert extensions followed by only inert extensions we get a maximal chain c of r subextensions of s containing tsr such that c c still using lemma 4 10 we get that c c if and only if there exist u t v c such that u t is inert t v is minimal non inert and u t t v assume that these conditions hold so that there exist u v u v such that u u is minimal non inert and v v is inert in particular the conductors of these minimal extensions lie above m u t t v u v in u using the previous construction to get a maximal chain c of r subextensions of s containing tsr we get that n m r msupp tsr r in deed rn vn is neither infra integral nor t closed so that tsr n 6 rn sn moreover since u t is inert we get that u m 6 t m for the same reason let p max s be lying over m so that r m r 6 s p giving p tsr msuppt s r s t sr because um sm is not infra integral then p tsr p vs m msuppt s r s t sr catenarian extensions 15 let r s be a ring extension then r is said unbranched in s if r is local we recall the following lemma lemma 4 12 21 lemma 3 29 let r s be an fcp ring extension such that r is unbranched in s then t is local for each t r s theorem 4 13 an integral fcp unbranched extension r s is cate narian if and only if r s r tsr tsr s and tsr s is catenar ian proof since r is unbranched in s any element of r s is local by lemma 4 12 one implication of the statement is proposition 4 9 conversely assume that r s is catenarian then tsr s is catenarian by proposition 3 3 we claim that r s r tsr tsr s deny so that there exists some t r s r tsr tsr s in particular r t is not infra integral and t s is not t closed then t ttr 6 t and t t is t closed since r s is fcp there exist u t t v t s such that u t is minimal inert and t v is minimal ramified it cannot be minimal decomposed because v is local let m be the maximal ideal of u so that m u t max t because t u is t closed 6 lemma 3 17 giving m t v because m max t and m t v then lemma 4 10 shows that u v 2 which yields that u v is not catenarian a contradiction to conclude r s r tsr tsr s proposition 4 14 let r s be an integral fcp extension such that t sr s is catenarian setting m 1 n max s n r msupp tsr r and m 2 n max s n r msupp s tsr the following statements hold 1 m 1 m 2 n max s n r msupp s r 2 r s is catenarian if and only if for each u t v r s such that u t is minimal inert and t v is minimal non inert and for each n m 1 n m 2 such that u t n t and t v n t we have n 6 n 3 if m 1 m 2 then r s is catenarian proof 1 obvious since n r msupp s tsr for any n m 2 and msupp s r msupp tsr r msupp s tsr 2 set n r s by propositions 4 9 and 4 11 any chain con taining tsr has length n and r s is not catenarian if and only if there exist u t v r s such that u t is inert and t v is minimal non inert with u t t v assume that r s is not catenarian then t v r msupp tsr r and n tsr n 16 g picavet and m picavet vs u t msuppt s r s t sr let n vs u t it follows thatn r t v r msupp tsr r so that n m 1 moreover n tsr msuppt s r s t sr implies that n r msuppr s tsr so that n m 2 then n m 1 m 2 conversely if there exists some n m 1 m 2 such that u t n t and t v n t for some u t v r s such that u t is minimal inert and t v is minimal non inert then u t t v so that r s is not catenarian to conclude r s is catenarian if and only if for each u t v r s such that u t is minimal inert and t v is minimal non inert and for each n m 1 n m 2 such that u t n t and t v n t we have n 6 n 3 if m 1 m 2 then 2 shows that r s is catenarian if r s is a ring extension and n a positive integer an n minimal subextension is an extension u v where u v r s which is a tower of n minimal extensions we say that r s is 2 catenarian if each of its 2 minimal subextension has length 2 this definition will allow us to give a simpler characterization of cate narity than in proposition 4 14 moreover we gave in 19 a complete characterization of extensions of length 2 which play a fundamental role in the lattice properties of extensions theorem 4 15 an integral fcp extension r s is catenarian if and only if tsr s is catenarian and r s is 2 catenarian proof one implication is obvious conversely assume that tsr s is catenarian r s is 2 catenarian but not catenarian the assumption of the theorem is the same as in the proof of proposition 4 14 using this proof and proposition 4 11 r s is not catenarian if and only if there exist u t v r s such that u t is inert and t v is minimal non inert with u t t v for such u t v set m u t t v so that m u v max u because r s is 2 catenarian we get that u v 2 since u v is neither t closed nor infra integral t tv u 6 u v let u 1 u t be such that u u 1 is minimal either ramified or decomposed since u t is infra integral then u u 1 m and tu 1 v which implies that u v 2 u tu 1 2 according to 8 propositions 7 1 and 7 4 a contradiction it follows that r s is catenarian corollary 4 16 an integral fcp extension r s such that tsr s is catenarian and r s r tsr tsr s is catenarian proof according to theorem 4 15 it is enough to show that r s is 2 catenarian to get that r s is catenarian so let t u v catenarian extensions 17 r s such that t u and u v are minimal then either u r tsr or u tsr or u tsr s in case we have t u v r tsr because u v is minimal so that v 6 tsr s since u tsr then t v 2 by proposition 4 7 in case we have u tsr it follows that t r tsr and v tsr s we claim that t v t u v deny and let u t v t u v then u 6 tsr which implies u r u u s if u r u we have t u u a contradiction since t u is minimal if u u s we have u u v a contradiction since u v is minimal then t v t u v and t v 2 in case we have t u v tsr s because t u is minimal so that t 6 r tsr since tsr u then t v 2 because tsr s is catenarian gathering all the situations we get that r s is 2 catenarian and then catenarian remark 4 17 we can easily find examples of catenarian fcp integral extensions r s such that tsr 6 r s with tsr s catenarian and m 1 m 2 6 in proposition 4 14 it is enough to take r m a local ring so that m 1 max s m 2 since any n max s satisfies n r m msupp tsr r msupp s tsr see 19 proposition 4 7 and for the example 19 example 4 10 2 k l is a minimal field extension set r k and s k l then tsr k 2 and r s r tsr s which is obviously catenarian the remaining case to study is the characterization of t closed fcp catenarian extensions for an fcp t closed integral extension the catenarian property is a convenient property according to proposition 4 3 and corollary 3 6 then using proposition 2 7 we get that an fcp integral t closed extension r s with i r s is catenarian if and only if the residual extensions r p r p s q s q is catenarian for any q vs i and p q r it follows that the catenarian property relies heavily on the characterization of catenarian field extensions this last characterization is an open problem in this paper a purely inseparable field extension is called radicial note that if k l is a radicial fip field extension then k l is a chain whence k l is catenarian the following result by dobbs shapiro gives a new reduction of the study proposition 4 18 9 theorem 2 9 a finite dimensional field ex tension k l with separable closure t is catenarian if and only if k t is catenarian in particular a finite dimensional radicial field extension is catenarian 18 g picavet and m picavet in the introduction of their paper 9 page 2604 dobbs and shapiro noted that a finite dimensional galois field extension is catenarian if and only if its galois group is supersolvable recall that a finite group g is called supersolvable if there exists a finite chain 1 gr g 1 g 0 g of normal subgroups of g such that each factor group gi gi 1 is cyclic a finite lattice l is called supersolvable 24 example 3 14 4 if it possesses a maximal chain c such that the sublattice generated by c and any other chain of l is distributive for a finite galois extension we are going to show that being catenarian is equivalent to being supersolvable as a lattice to this aim we introduce a new material an element x of a lattice l is left modular if it satisfies y x z y x z for all y z and l is called left modular if it has a maximal chain of left modular elements 26 page 481 the reader is warned that this notion should not be confused with the classical definition of modular proposition 4 19 9 page 2604 let k l be a finite galois exten sion with galois group g the following conditions are equivalent 1 k l is catenarian 2 g is supersolvable 3 g is catenarian proposition 4 20 let k l be a finite galois extension then k l is catenarian if and only if k l is a supersolvable lattice proof by 23 page 197 a supersolvable lattice is catenarian conversely assume that k l is catenarian and let g be the galois group of the extension in 23 example 2 5 it was proved that for a supersolvable group g the lattice of its subgroups is a supersolvable lattice then proposition 4 19 asserts that the lattice g of subgroups of g is supersolvable let k l g defined by k autk l the group of k automorphisms of l for each k k l then is a reversing order isomorphism of lattices let c 1 be a maximal chain of k l c 2 be an other chain of k l and h the sublattice of k l generated by c 1 and c 2 that is the least sublattice of k l containing c 1 and c 2 and closed for and set c 1 c 1 and c 2 c 2 then c 1 is a maximal chain of g and c 2 is a chain of g since g is supersolvable the lattice h of g generated by c 1 and c 2 is distributive and so is any sublattice of h because of the reversing order isomorphism it follows that h is the greatest sublattice of g contained in c 1 c 1 and c 2 c 2 and closed for and in particular h h then h is distributive and so is h to conclude k l is supersolvable catenarian extensions 19 proposition 4 21 let k l be a finite separable extension with normal closure n then k n is catenarian if and only if the galois group g of k n is supersolvable if this condition holds k l is catenarian proof proposition 4 19 entails the first part of the proposition if this condition holds k l is catenarian since so is k n proposition 4 20 cannot be generalized to any catenarian extension nevertheless we have the following result proposition 4 22 let r s be an fip extension then r s is catenarian and left modular if and only if r s is supersolvable proof one implication is thomas paper 26 theorem 1 1 conversely a supersolvable lattice is catenarian 23 page 197 moreover 23 proposition 2 2 shows that a supersolvable lattice is left modular we next give another characterization of catenarian finite separable field extensions for a field k we denote by ku x the set of all monic polynomials of k x our riding hypotheses are l k x is a finite separable whence fip field extension of k with degree n and f x ku x is the minimal polynomial of x over k for any k k l we denote by fk x ku x the minimal polynomial of x over k and set d fk k k l the elements of d have been characterized in 20 proposition 4 13 according to 20 corollary 4 9 there is a reversing order bijection k l d defined by k 7 fk which gives that d is an ordered set for the divisibility and a lattice we begin with a characterization of minimal subextensions of k l proposition 4 23 21 proposition 4 8 let l k x be a finite sep arable field extension of k and k k a subextension then k k is minimal if and only if fk is a maximal proper divisor of fk in d proposition 4 24 a finite separable field extension k l k x is catenarian if and only if all maximal chains of d have the same length proof use the bijection k l d defined by k 7 fk the following result due to dobbs mullins gives an example of cate narian field extensions proposition 4 25 3 proposition 2 2 a let k l be a finite abelian field extension such that l k s i 1 p ei i is it prime power factorization then k l is catenarian with k l s i 1 ei 20 g picavet and m picavet we can find other examples of catenarian or not catenarian field extensions in dobbs and shapiro s paper 9 example 4 26 let k l be a finite field extension and n l k if n is a prime number or the product pq of any possibly equal prime numbers p and q then k l is catenarian minimal in the first case and of length 2 in the second case 9 lemma 2 1 c if n 6 m where m is an even positive integer there exists a non catenarian field extension of degree n 9 theorem 2 4 example 4 27 let k l be a finite separable field extension of degree n which is not catenarian see example 4 26 and let be an algebraic closure of k then k l is e tale and diagonalizes l 1 proposition 2 a v 29 more precisely k l n according to corollary 4 8 n is catenarian although k l is not while k is faithfully flat see our remark after proposition 4 5 we end this paper with an application of our results to pointwise minimal extensions we characterized these extensions in a joint paper with cahen 2 a ring extension r s is called pointwise minimal if r r t is minimal for each t s r a pointwise minimal extension is either integral or pru fer and in this last case is minimal and then catenarian in the integral case there is a maximal ideal m of r such that m r s there are four types of integral pointwise minimal extensions since we study the catenarian property we consider only fcp extensions so let r s be an integral fcp pointwise minimal extension set m r s and k r m then r s satisfies one of the following conditions 2 theorem 5 4 where sr denotes the swan seminormalization of r in s 25 1 r sr and s t sr with s m k 2 if k 6 z 2 z and s m kn if k z 2 z where n vs m 2 s sr with x 2 m for any x n where n is the unique maximal ideal of s lying above m 3 r tsr so that s m is a field and either k s m is a separable minimal extension or c k p a prime integer and xp r for any x s 4 sr t sr with x 2 m for any x n where n is the unique maximal ideal of s lying above m c k p is a prime integer and xp r for any x s in all cases except 4 r s is catenarian 2 proposition 5 8 this is obvious for the two first cases since r s is infra integral proposition 4 7 in the third case if k s m is a separable minimal extension r s is minimal and then obviously catenarian in the catenarian extensions 21 second subcase if u is the separable closure of k s m we have either k u or k u minimal so in both subsubcases k s m is catenarian according to proposition 4 18 the last case leads to a non catenarian extension indeed setting t tsr r n l 1 t s and pl 1 r t 2 corollary 5 17 shows that for each i 0 l 1 there exists a maximal chain from r to s of length pi l 1 so that r s is not catenarian references 1 n bourbaki alge bre chs 4 7 masson paris 1981 2 p j cahen g picavet and m
