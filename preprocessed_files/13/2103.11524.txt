non vanishing local cohomology modules of b r b v b k where r is either a complete regular local ring or a complete local normal domain with coefficient ring v field k and b is its integral closure in an algebraic extension of q r similar problem is also studied over a normal domain r containing a field k of characteristic 0 in this connection new observations on the direct summand property for integral extensions are also presented 1 introduction in this note we mainly address the following problem let r be a normal domain containing a field k of characteristic 0 or let r m be a complete regular local ring complete local normal domain of dimension n with co efficient ring v field k let k denote the field of fractions of r and let b denote the integral closure of r in an algebraic extension f of k let b r b v b k denote the module of differentials of b over r v k respectively problem determine whether homr b k r homr b v r 6 0 homr b r r 6 0 or determine the highest non vanishing local cohomology modules with respect to m of b v b k and b r in section 2 we prove several lemmas that will be used in the proofs of theorems in section 3 section 4 the corresponding results include providing sufficient conditions for a extensions a b so that b a becomes b flat b a becomes null and for b extensions a b c so that the corresponding right exact sequence of module of differentials becomes left exact another useful tool in this respect is theorem 2 3 where by utilizing popescu s work 11 14 we provide a simple proof of the fact that for any geometrically regular extension of noetherian rings a b b a is b flat and b a 0 ams subject classification 13 d 02 13 d 22 13 d 45 13 n 05 key words and phrases module of differentials integral extension geometric

popescu 11 via his characterization of geometrically regular extensions a stronger version of this result has been proved by gabber ramero cor 5 6 25 4 as a corollary to lemma 2 1 it has been pointed out that for any in tegral domain a integral over a complete local normal domain r m of dimension n such thatq a is separably algebraic overq r hnm a r 0 one of our main results in section 3 is the following theorem 3 5 let r be a normal domain of dimension n containing a field k of characteristic 0 with a non null derivation d derk r and let b be its integral closure in an algebraic extension f of k then homr b k r 6 0 if r m is a complete local normal domain of dimension n with maximal ideal m and a non null derivation d derk r then h n m b k 6 0 the two key steps in the proof of this theorem are theorem 3 1 and proposition 3 4 where the same statement is proved for a complete d v r and for a d v r with a non null derivation respectively in these proofs we provide a prescription for defining a non null r linear map b k r that depends on the non null derivation d next we deal with complete local domains we would like to mention here that if c q is a complete local domain of dimension n with coeffi cient ring v k then c v c k is not necessarily a finitely generated c module we prove the following theorem 3 6 let c q be a complete local domain of dimension n 2 with coefficient ring v field k let r m be a power series ring over v k contained in c such that c is a module finite extension of r we have the following i if q c q r is separably algebraic then hnq c v h

theorem 3 7 the final result of this section can be viewed as an extension of the theorem on purity of branch locus 10 15 to infinitely generated integrally closed domains b integral over a regular local ring r in section 4 we deal with the situation where r is a complete regular local ring and b is the absolute integral closure of r our problem is irrelevant in positive characteristic since b k 0 and b r 0 i e local cohomology of module of differentials of integral extensions 3 k b and r b are unramified extensions due to theorem 3 5 we focus our attention on mixed characteristic in this part of our work the highest non vanishing local cohomology of b r gets connected with the direct summand property for integral extensions of r conjectured by m hochster 7 hochster proved the equicharacteristic case of his conjecture in early seventies 7 in 2016 y andre 2 proved this conjecture in mixed characteristic by using aspects of almost ring theory introduced by faltings in his work on p adic hodge theory afterwards bhatt 3 gave a short proof of this conjecture and its derived variant both proofs use the notion of perfectoid geometry the main theorem in section 4 is the following theorem 4 1 let r m be a complete regular local ring of di mension n with coefficient ring v of mixed characteristic p and let b denote its absolute integral closure we have the following i b v p b v b r p b r these observations imply the following a for any ideal i of r of the form i p x 1 xi 1 generated by a part of a system of parameters containing p of r h ii b v 0 and h ii b r 0 in particular h n m b v 0 and h n m b r 0 b b v 0 b r where denotes the i adic completion and hence v b r b v b and r b are all formally unramified extensions ii non vanishing of hn 1 m b r implies the direct summand prop erty for integral extensions of r equivalently descent of flatness for integral extensions of noetherian rings 12 and the converse is also true non vanishing of hn 1 m b v implies the direct summand property for integral extensions over r for part i we do not need r to be regular actually we prove a much more general statement as a corollary due to y andre s proof of the direct summand conjecture in mixed characteristic it follows that hn 1 m b r 6 0 we do not know whether part ii of the above theorem is valid in equicharacteristic zero as corollaries to proposition 4 2 we derive the following over r v x 1 xn 1 and m b as above i for any i 0 if h i 1 m b 6 0 then h im b r 6 0 and ii for any i 0 there exists an exact sequence 0 n 1 1 ext n i 1 r b r ext n i r b r r ext n i r b v r 0 4 s p dutta in particular 0 n 1 1 b ext 1 r b r r ext 1 r b v r 0 is exact our final theorem deals with local cohomology with respect to the ideal x 1 xn 1 generated by a part of a regular system of pa rameters the second assertion in this theorem provides an apparently approachable sufficient condition for the direct summand property theorem 4 3 let r m be a complete regular local ring in mixed characteristics p 0 with co efficient ring v and b be its absolute in tegral closure let p x 1 xn 1 be a system of parameters of r such that x 1 xn 1 form a regular system of parameters let x denote the ideal x 1 xn 1 in r then h n 1 x b v 6 0 non vanishing of hn 1 x b r implies the direct summand property for integral exten sions of r corollary if h 0 p h n 1 x b v 6 0 then h n 1 m b v 6 0 let us note that some of the results proved in section 4 are not valid in equicharacteristic zero i do not know answers to several questions that came up during the course of this work a few of these questions related to this paper are mentioned at the end for definition of s r and for basic properties of s r and s r the reader is referred to 5 14 notations given an extension r s the corresponding module of differentials is denoted by s r instead of 1 s r d v r stands for discrete valuation ring for any integral domain ring c q c denotes the field of fractions quotient ring of c for any local ring r m e denotes the injective hull of r m over r e k p denotes the injective hull of r p over r and for any r modulem m stands homr m e m stands for homr m r section 2 in this section we are going to prove several lemmas and propositions that will be used in section 3 and section 4 2 1 lemma let r be a normal domain r a an integral extension such that a is an integral domain and q r q a is a separable algebraic extension then homr a r r 0 proof for any a a a 6 0 the minimal polynomial f x for a has all its co efficient in r separability of q a over q r implies f a 6 0 since f a 0 f a da 0 1 local cohomology of module of differentials of integral extensions 5 since f a is integral over r and a is an integral domain an integral equation of smallest degree satisfied by f a is of the form f a t r 1 f a t 1 rt 0 ri r where rt 6 0 this implies due to 1 that rtda 0 this is true for every a in a r thus a r is a torsion module over both a and r and hence homr a r r 0 corollary if r m is a complete local normal domain of dimension n and a is as above then hnm a r 0 this follows from local duality due to the fact that the canonical module of r is isomorphic to a height 1 ideal in r and r can be embedded into this ideal 2 2 sub lemma let r s be two integral domains such that s r x 1 xn f 1 fn where f 1 fn form anr x 1 xn sequence and q s q r is separably algebraic then s r 0 proof let i f 1 fn we have the following exact sequence of s modules 0 s r i i 2 n 1 sdxi s r 0 2 since i i 2 is a free s module of rank n and s is a domain i i 2 is torsion free over s hence so is s r unless it is 0 since q s q r is separably algebraic q s q r 0 i e s r q s 0 tensoring the above sequence with q s we obtain the following exact sequence 0 q s s r q s i i 2 n 1 q s dxi 0 3 since rank q s i i 2 n rank n 1 q s dxi it follows from 3 that q s s r 0 hence s r 0 lemma let r s be two regular rings such that s is a module finite extension of r and q s is separable algebraic over q r then s r 0 proof first we assume that both r and s are local since dimr dims we have s r x 1 xn p where p is a prime ideal of height n one could also write s r x 1 xn t p where t is the inverse image of the maximal ideal of s under the onto map r x 1 xn s since s is regular local p is a complete intersection ideal generated by n elements and p p 2 is a free s module of rank n the proof now follows by the above sub lemma now let us assume that r is local let m denote the maximal ideal of r and let m 1 mr denote the maximal ideals of s let si smi for 1 i n and let r s and s i denote them adic completions of r s 6 s p dutta and si respectively then s i is a complete regular local ring module finite over r it can be checked that s r s s r r i 1 s i r due to the result proved above it follows that s r s 0 and hence s r 0 finally the general case follows via localization 2 3 theorem andre gabber ramero popescu see intro duction let a b be an extension of noetherian rings such that b is geometrically regular over a then b a is b flat and b a 0 proof popescu s theorem 11 14 asserts that in the above situ ation b lim c a filtered inductive limit over smooth a algebras c then c a is a finitely generated projective c module and c a 0 since b a lim c a b a lim c a the conclusion follows 2 4 lemma a b c are injective ring homomorphisms of integral domains such that q c is a separable algebraic extension of q b and b a is a flat b module then the following sequence 0 b a b c c a c b 0 is exact proof we have an exact sequence 0 c b a b a b c c a c b 0 4 since b a is b flat b a b c is c flat since c is an integral domain this implies that c b a is a torsion free c module unless it is null let s c 0 tensoring 4 with s 1 c q c we obtain the following exact sequence 0 s 1 c b a q b q a q c q c q a q c q b 0 since q c is separable algebraic over q b q c is quasi smooth in grothendieck s language formally smooth with respect to discreet topology over q b and hence it follows that s 1 c b a 0 20 5 7 5 since c b a is torsion free it follows that c b a 0 2 5 here we state a result that has been used several times in this paper this result is known as jacobi zariski sequence henceforth jz sequence jz sequence 1 14 given ring extensions a b c there exists an exact sequence c a c b b a c c a c b 0 if b a is b flat then this sequence can be extended by putting b a c on the left for a proof we refer the reader to 14 local cohomology of module of differentials of integral extensions 7 section 3 equicharacteristic 0 complete local domains and extension of purity 3 1 theorem let r m be a complete discrete valuation ring containing a field k of characteristic 0 and let b denote its integral closure in an algebraic extension f of q r then homr b k r 6 0 proof let k denote the field of fractions of r since characteristic of k 0 r is geometrically regular over k by theorem 2 3 r k is a flat r module and hence torsion free over r let r c c b be such that c c are integral closures of r in q c q c respectively and q c k q c k then c c are module finite extensions of r and c is a module finite extension of c since r is a complete d v r c c are also the same hence by argument as above c k c k is a flat c c module and c c 0 lemma 2 2 due to lemma 2 4 and the jz sequence 2 5 we obtain the following short exact sequences 0 c k b b k b c 0 5 0 r k c c k c r 0 6 0 c k c c k c c 0 7 0 c r c c r c c 0 8 also note that b k lim c k and b r lim c r over all c as above 9 since characteristic of k 0 and r is a complete d v r any c as above is of the form c r x f x r b where f x is monic irreducible in r x 13 thus c is a free r module with bases 1 b b 2 bn 1 n deg f x hence c r c f b db is a cyclic c module generated by db it follows from 5 6 7 and 9 that any b k can be expressed as ti i cdb c c for some c as above i r k ti c 1 i r 10 let tr f k denote the trace map for any x 6 0 f if x l f such that l k then tr x trl k x l k let d derk r be non null e g d x r k x k r m since characteristic of k 0 d can be extended uniquely to a derivation d same notation b f we define an r linear map l b k k as follows for any b k l tr d where d b k f is the b linear map induced by d claim im l r 8 s p dutta proof of the claim due to 10 given any b k we have l l ti i l cdb for any x b tr x r and d i r for every i hence l ti i r 11 we need to show that l cdb r recall that f b 0 where f x is an irreducible polynomial in r x let f x xn r 1 x n 1 rn ri r then we have f b db n 1 d ri b n i 0 hence f b d db d ri b n i 0 due to separability f b 6 0 this implies d db d ri b n i f b 1 i n since c r b c sib i si r 0 i n 1 due to the fact that f b 0 and d ri r for 1 i n we obtain d cdb cd db ib i f b i r 0 i n 1 since tr bi f b 0 for i n 1 and tr bn 1 f b 1 13 we have l cdb itr b i f b r 12 from 11 and 12 l r for any b k and thus the claim is proved 3 2 remarks notations are as in the proof of the above theorem 1 we have b k lim c k and b k lim c k since c is com plete d v r containing a field k of characteristic 0 c is geometrically regular over k it follows by theorem 2 3 that c k is a flat torsion free c module and c k 0 hence b k is a flat torsion free b module and b k 0 2 we have b r lim c r since c r is a cyclic c module of finite length h 0 m b r b r and by lemma 2 1 h 1 m b r 0 3 3 corollary notations are as in the proof of the above theorem the following sequence 0 b r r k h 1 m b h 1 m b k 0 is exact from remark 1 and the exact sequence 0 r k b b k b r 0 we obtain the following exact sequence 0 h 0 m b r h 1 m r k b h 1 m b k 0 since r k is a flat r module we have h 1 m r k b r k h 1 m b the assertion now follows from remark 2 3 4 next we deal with the non complete d v r case proposition let r m be a discreet valuation ring containing a field k of characteristic 0 with a non null derivation d derk r and local cohomology of module of differentials of integral extensions 9 let b be its integral closure in an algebraic extension f of q r then homr b k r 6 0 proof let k denote the field of fractions of r since characteristic of k 0 d can be extended uniquly to a derivation d same notation b f let tr f k denote the trace map we define an r linear map l b k k in the following way for any b k l tr d where d b k f is the b linear map induced by d claim im l r can assume d 6 0 we will show that l r let c be a normal domain integral over r such that q c k and c b we have b k lim c k over all such c as above for any r c c c c as above are module finite extensions of r and hence are semi local dedekind domains since characteristics of k 0 for any such c k c is geometrically regular and hence c k is a flat c module theorem 2 3 the exact sequences 5 8 in 3 1 are valid here in particular we have the following exact sequence 0 c k c c k c c 0 13 the left exactness in 13 follows from lemma 2 2 and the jz sequence 2 5 without any lose of generality can assume c k for some c as above let q 1 qr be the maximal ideals of c lying over m then c c q 1 c qr m adic completion 14 here each c qi is a complete d v r and a module finite extension of r since r contains a field of characteristic 0 each cqi c qi is geometrically regular and hence so is c c by theorem 2 3 c c is a flat c module and c c 0 hence due to the jz sequence 2 5 we obtain the following short exact sequence 0 c k c c k c c 0 15 we also have c k c q 1 k c qr k 16 due to the fact that b k lim c k and 13 15 and 16 we can write 1 r i c qi k 1 i r 17 since d derk r and derk r r derk r r being local any such d is continuous d can be extended uniquely to a derivation d r r this derivation d can be extended uniquely to a derivation d i c qi ki whereki is the field of fractions of c qi 1 i r thus d can be extended uniquely to a derivation d c k 1 kr 10 s p dutta such that d c qi d i due to uniqueness of extension of derivation we have d c d hence from 17 we have d di i where di is the corre sponding c qi linear map c qi k ki this implies that l tr d tr di i by theorem 3 1 tr di i r 1 i r hence l k r r and the claim is proved remark remarks in 3 2 and corollary of 3 3 are also valid here 3 5 our next theorem in this section addresses the general set up theorem let r be a normal domain containing a field k of charac teristic 0 with a non null derivation d derk r and let b be its inte gral closure in an algebraic extension f of q r then homr b k r 6 0 in particular if r m is a complete local normal domain of di mension n containing a field k of characteristic 0 with a derivation as above then hnm b k 6 0 proof let k denote the field of fractions of r since characteristic of k 0 d can be extended to a derivation d same notation b f and hence to a derivation bp f for any prime ideal p of r let tr f k denote the trace map we define an r linear map l b k k in the following way for any b k l tr d where d b k f is the b linear map induced by d the same prescription works for bp k f for any prime ideal p of r claim im l r can assume d 6 0 let p be a prime ideal of height 1 in r let also denote the image of in bp k it follows from proposition 3 4 that l rp since this holds for every prime ideal p of height 1 in r and r is a normal domain l htp 1 rp r hence the claim follows in particular if r is a complete local normal domain then the canon ical module of r is isomorphic to a height 1 ideal of r hence the assertion follows by local duality 3 6 the following theorem deals with complete local domains we recall that if c q is a complete local domain of dimension n with coefficient ring v k then c v c k is not necessarily a finitely gen erated c module theorem let c q be a complete local domain of dimension n 2 with coefficient ring v field k let r m be a power series ring over v k contained in c such that c is a module finite extension of r we local cohomology of module of differentials of integral extensions 11 have the following i if q c q r is separably algebraic then rank c k n rank c v n 1 and h n q c v h n q c k 6 0 ii if characteristic of k p 0 k perfect and q c k 6 0 then rank c k q c q c p hnq c k 6 0 and iii if q c q r is separably algebraic then hnq c r 0 more over if c r 6 0 and c is normal then h n 1 q c r 6 0 proof let r k x 1 xn or r v x 1 xn 1 be con tained in c such that c is a module finite extension of r letm denote the maximal ideal of r then for any c module m him m h i q m for i 0 we intend to show that c v c k them adic equivalently q adic completion of c v c k is a finitely generated c module of finite rank and hence a finitely generated r module of finite rank this would imply that homr c v c k r 6 0 since r is complete we have homr c v c k r homr c v c k r 6 0 now the result would follow by local duality i a equicharacteristic case the arguments in 21 9 5 5 show that c k is a finitely generated c module and rankc c k n b mixed characteristic p in this case c is a module finite extension of r v x 1 xn 1 we need to modify the arguments in 21 9 5 5 for this purpose we need the following lemma lemma let r m be as above then r v is a faithfully flat r module r v r n 1 and the sequence 0 mt t 0 r v r v r v 0 is split exact proof of the lemma there exists an exact sequence 0 r m m m 2 r v r m 0 1 p this implies that dim r v r m n 1 hence due to theorem 2 3 r v is a faithfully flat r module moreover t the hausdorff module associated with r v i e r v m t r v is generated by images of dx 1 dxn 1 over r r being complete implies t is also complete and hence t r v due to the existence of derivations xi r r xi xj ij 1 i j n 1 and duality between 12 s p dutta derivatives and differentials it follows that images of dx 1 dxn 1 are linearly independent in r v thus r v is free r module of rank n 1 and this implies the split exactness of the sequence in the lemma now arguing as in 21 9 5 5 we observe that c v is a finitely generated c module of finite rank n 1 and hence a finitely generated r module of finite rank ii characteristic of k p 0 we assume that k is perfect and q c k 6 0 let r 1 k x p 1 x p n by 21 9 4 5 c k c r 1 let a r 1 c p then c r 1 c a let y 1 yt in c form a p basis of q c over q r 1 i e q c over k since k is perfect due to our assumption that q c k 6 0 such a basis exists let b a y 1 yt then b is a free a module of rank pt and b a is a free b module of rank t with basis dy 1 dyt we have the following short exact sequence b a c c a c b 0 since q c q b c b is a torsion c module claim dy 1 dyt are also linearly independent in c a the claim follows via the existence of linearly independent q a derivations yi q c q c yi yj ij 1 i j t due to the above exact sequence we conclude that c a is a finitely generated c module of rank t hence c k is a finitely generated r module of finite rank the referee made the following observation if q c q r is not separable then since r c s module finite c r q c c r q c q c q r 6 0 since c k c r is onto it follows that c k q c 6 0 and thus c k has a positive rank iii now assume that r is a complete regular local ring contained in c such that c is a module finite extension of r and q c q r is separably algebraic then by corollary to lemma 2 1 hnm c r 0 assume in addition that c r 6 0 and c is normal let 0 r k htp 1 e k p e 0 denote an injec tive resolution of r k q r let t im then t htp 1 e k p is an essential extension consider the exact sequence 0 r k t 0 by assumption homr c r k homk q c k k 0 and ext i r c r k 0 for every i 0 hence homr c r t ext 1 r c r r thus by local cohomology of module of differentials of integral extensions 13 local duality in order to prove our assertion we need to show that homr c r t 6 0 we have an injection homr c r t homr c r htp 1 e k p if homr c r e k p homrp cp rp e k p 0 for ev ery prime ideal p of r of height 1 then cp rp 0 for every prime ideal of height 1 hence cq r 0 for every prime ideal q of height 1 in c by the theorem on purity of branch locus 8 13 this would imply c r 0 a contradiction thus there exists at least one prime ideal p of height 1 such that homr c r e k p 6 0 hence homr c r htp 1 e k p 6 0 let f 6 0 homr c r htp 1 e k p c r is a finitely gener ated r module let 1 t denote the generators of c r then each f i 1 i t has only finitely many non null components in htp 1 e k p since t htp 1 e k p is essential there exists s 6 0 in r such that sf i t for 1 i t and sf i 6 0 for at least one i thus homr c r t 6 0 remarks 1 the proof for part i of the above theorem is valid in equicharacteristic when dimension c 1 2 with hypothesis as in part iii of the above theorem dim c r n 1 the proof in this part is also valid in the non complete case 3 7 our final result of this section can be viewed as an extension of the theorem on purity of branch locus 10 15 to infinitely generated integrally closed domains b integral over a regular local ring r let us recall that an extension r s is unramified if and only if s r 0 and a local extension r m s q of essentially finite type is unramified if and only if ms q and s q is a separable algebraic extension of r m theorem let r be a regular local ring and let b denote the integral closure of r in a field extension k of q r such that k q r is separably algebraic suppose that for every prime ideal q of height 1 in b bq r 0 then b r 0 i e b is an unramified extension of r proof if k q r then this is the usual theorem on purity of branch locus assume that k q r let r c c b be such that c c are integral closures of r in q c q c respectively and q c q r q c q r then c c are module finite extensions of r and c is a module finite extension of c since 14 s p dutta b lim c b r lim c r over all such c as mentioned above let q be a prime ideal of b of height 1 and let p q r then bp r lim cp r from the assumption it follows that bp r 0 each cp is a semi local dedekind domain and cp c p is a module finite extension hence c p cp 0 lemma 2 2 by the jz sequence 2 5 we obtain an exact sequence 0 cp r c p c p r c p cp 0 since bp r 0 from the above exact sequence it follows that cp r 0 for every such c by our assumption this holds for every prime ideal p of height 1 in r and hence for prime ideals of height 1 in c we have c r 0 due to the theorem on purity of branch locus it follows that c r 0 for every such c hence b r 0 section 4 mixed characteristic in this section we deal with the situation r b where b is the absolute integral closure of r in the positive characteristic p 0 case we have b r 0 b k 0 i e k b r b are unramified extensions due to theorem 3 5 we now concentrate on the mixed char acteristic case first we define formally unramified extension 19 10 5 definition let f a b be a continuous ring homomorphism between two topological rings we say b is formally unramified over a if given any discrete a algebra c any ideal i of c such that i 2 0 c i with discrete topology and c c i the natural surjection every continuous a algebra homomorphism b c i has at most one a algebra extension b c such that 4 1 theorem let r m be a complete regular local ring of dimension n in mixed characteristic p with coefficient ring v and let b denote its absolute integral closure we have the following i b v p b v b r p b r these observations imply the following a for any ideal i of r of the form i p x 1 xi 1 generated by a part of a system of parameters containing p of r h ii b v 0 and h ii b r 0 in particular h n m b v 0 and h n m b r 0 b b v 0 b r where denotes the i adic completion and hence v b r b v b and r b are all formally unramified extensions ii non vanishing of hn 1 m b r implies the direct summand prop erty for integral extensions of r 5 equivalently descent of flatness local cohomology of module of differentials of integral extensions 15 for integral extensions of noetherian rings 10 and the converse is also true non vanishing of hn 1 m b v implies the direct summand property for integral extensions of r proof i actually we would prove the following more general state ment let a be an integral domain of characteristic 0 and let b be the absolute integral closure of an integral domain c containing a let t be a positive integer such that t is not a unit in c then for any proper ideal i of a containing t and for every n 0 we have b a in b a let b a and b denote the i adic completion of b a and b respectively then b a 0 b a and a b a b are formally unramified extensions with respect to the i adic topology proof for every element x 6 0 in b x has a tnth root y in b i e yt n x hence dx tnyt n 1 dy this implies that b a t n b a and thereby b a i n b a for every n 0 let b b inb a a ina via base change we obtain b a b b a we have from above b a 0 hence b a 0 let b b inb b inb this implies b a b a 0 hence b a 0 it fol lows from 20 7 4 and 20 7 5 5 that a b a b are formally unramified extensions next let a q be a complete local normal domain of dimension n with coefficient ring v and let b be its absolute integral closure by our assumption it follows from above that b v p t b v and if i p x 1 xi 1 generated by a part of a system of parameters of r and it p t xt 1 x t i 1 then b v it b v for t 0 similar statement is valid for b r now the assertion follows immediately ii let r b denote the inclusion as mentioned in the setup we need to show that splits as an r module map hn 1 m b r 6 0 recall that splits as an r module map b homr b r 6 0 i e hnm b 6 0 8 same condition for descent of flatness 12 first we deal with the unramified case i e r v x 1 xn 1 if dimension of r 1 r v q b q r 0 implies that b r 1 p 0 hence h 0 m b r b r 6 0 we can assume dimr 2 16 s p dutta since the direct summand property is valid over r 2 we have hnm b 6 0 since v r is geometrically regular r v is a flat r module theorem 2 3 by lemma 2 4 we have the following short exact sequence 0 r v r b b v b r 0 since r v is a flat r module h i m r v b r v h i m b for every i 0 applying local cohomology to the above short exact sequence by i we obtain the following short exact sequence hn 1 m b r r v r h n m b 0 18 due to the short exact sequence 0 r m m m 2 r v r m 0 1 p we obtain r v r m 6 0 and thus r v is faithfully flat over r since hnm b 6 0 r v r h n m b 6 0 hence from 18 it follows that hn 1 m b r 6 0 conversely suppose that hn 1 m b r 6 0 consider the short exact sequence obtained via base change r b spectral sequence 0 ext 1 b b r b ext 1 r b r r homb b r ext 1 r b r note that since r m is complete given any r modulem extir m r is m separated actually it is linearly compact for every i 0 9 this can be checked by considering a free resolution f of m and then applying homr f r and noticing that for any continuous r linear map f t 1 t 2 between two linearly compactm separated r modules imf and kerf are both linearly compact m separated closed submod ules of t 2 and t 1 respectively 9 since ext 1 r b r is m separated and b r p n b r for every n 0 the right end term of the above exact sequence is 0 by local duality hn 1 m b r 6 0 implies ext 1 r b r r 6 0 hence from the above exact sequence ext 1 b b r b 6 0 and thus b 6 0 if hn 1 m b v 6 0 same argument as above shows that homr b r 6 0 now let us deal with the ramified case in this case the proof that ext 1 r b r r 6 0 implies homr b r 6 0 is same as above our proof for the reverse implication needs a modification due to the fact that in this case v r is not geometrically regular and hence r v is not necessarily flat we have the following exact sequence 0 n r v r b b v b r 0 19 local cohomology of module of differentials of integral extensions 17 since r is ramified r s x f x where s v x 1 xn 1 and f x is an eisenstein polynomial in s x then r s r f by lemma 2 2 and the jz sequence we have the following short exact sequence 0 s v s r r v r f r 0 tensoring this sequence with b we obtain the following exact se quence 0 s v s b r v r b b f b 0 20 let q denote the maximal ideal of s then for any r module m h iq m h i m m and homr b r homs b s since hnm b 6 0 and s v is faithfully flat over s it follows that hnm s v b s v h n m b 6 0 we have s v h n m b hom s v h n m b hom s v b n 1 1 b lemma in i b theo rem 3 6 hence from the above exact sequence we obtain hnm r v b 6 0 we also obtain an exact sequence lemma 2 4 via v s b 0 s v s b b v b s 0 21 in 19 let w im from 19 20 and 21 we get the following commutative diagram of exact sequences 0 0 y y n n y y 0 s v b r v b b f b 0 y y 22 0 s v b w u 0 y y 0 0 from the exact column on the right end we obtain hnm n 0 hence from the middle column we obtain hnm r v b h n m w 6 0 now applying local cohomology to the exact sequence from 19 0 w b v b r 0 we obtain our required result hn 1 m b r 6 0 by part i 18 s p dutta when s v is not flat over s i e when s v r s x f x as mentioned earlier dimr 1 and dimb 1 then b v is p torsion and h 0 p b v b v 6 0 corollaries with r b as in the above theorem we have the fol lowing i hn 1 m b r 6 0 this follows due to andre s proof 2 of the direct summand con jecture ii ext 1 b b r b 6 0 this follows from the proof of the theorem remark we do not know whether part ii of the above theorem is valid in equicharacteristic zero 4 2 our next proposition points out a relation between local coho mologies of b and that of b r b v proposition let r m be a complete unramified regular local ring of dimension n with coefficient ring v and let b be its absolute integral closure then for every i 0 there exists a short exact sequence 0 him b v h i m b r r v r h i 1 m b 0 proof consider the exact sequence lemma 2 4 0 r v r b b v b r 0 since r v is r flat and r v r r m 6 0 r v is faithfully flat as an r module hence him r v r b r v r h i m b is non null whenever him b is so claim for any b module m b v b h i m m 0 same result holds for b r proof of the claim homr b v b h i m m e homb b v homr h i m m e homb b v ext n i r m r local duality since ext n ir m r is hausdorff in them adic topology and b v p n b v for n 0 we have homb b v ext n i r m r 0 and hence the claim follows now the assertion follows from noticing that the map him r v r b him b v is the composition of the following two maps r v r h i m b r v r b b h i m b b v b h i m b and b v b h i m b h i m b v when r v is not r flat i e when dimr 1 i e r v r v 0 and the asserted sequence becomes obvious local cohomology of module of differentials of integral extensions 19 corollary 1 with r b as above hi 1 m b 6 0 h i m b r 6 0 for i 0 corollary 2 with r b as above for every i 0 there exists a short exact sequence 0 n 1 1 ext n i 1 r b r ext n i r b r r ext n i r b v r 0 in particular 0 n 1 1 b ext 1 r b r r ext 1 r b v r 0 is exact proof it follows from the lemma in part b i theorem 3 6 that r v is a faithfully flat r module r v r n 1 and the sequence 0 mt t 0 r v r v r v 0 is split exact since r is complete ext n i 1 r b r is m separated a proof of this fact is sketched in the proof of part ii theorem 4 1 we have r v h i 1 m b homr r v h i 1 m b homr r v ext n i 1 r b r since ext n i 1 r b r is m separated it follows from the above lemma that homr r v ext n i 1 r b r homr n 1 1 r ext n i 1 r b r n 1 1 ext n i 1 r b r now applying homr e to our asserted exact sequence in the above proposition the corollary follows remarks 1 if dimr 2 then h 0 m b v h 0 m b r this follows due to the fact that if dimr 2 then h im b 0 i 0 1 and r v is r flat 2 part i of theorem 4 1 except hnm b r 0 and results in 4 2 are not necessarily valid in equicharacteristic zero this follows mainly due to theorem 3 5 4 3 our final theorem deals with local cohomology of module of differentials with respect to the ideal x 1 xn 1 generated by a part of a regular system of parameters theorem let r m be a complete regular local ring of dimension n in mixed characteristics p with co efficient ring v and let b be its absolute integral closure let p x 1 xn 1 be a system of parame ters of r such that x 1 xn 1 form a regular system of parameters let x denote the ideal x 1 xn 1 in r then h n 1 x b v 6 0 20 s p dutta non vanishing of hn 1 x b r implies the direct summand property for integral extensions of r proof for any x 6 0 r and for any r module m let k x m denote the complex 0 m m 1 x 0 and k x 1 xn 1 r denote the complex n 1 1 k xi r the local cohomology modules of b v with respect to m are obtained by taking cohomologies of k x 1 xn 1 r k p b v since this complex is a tensor product of two complexes we obtain the following exact sequence hn 1 m b v h n 1 x b v hn 1 x b v 1 p h n m b v 0 23 by theorem 4 1 hnm b v 0 hence is onto let q denote the prime ideal x r then qrq is a maximal ideal in rq we have hn 1 x b v 1 p b v 1 p r hn 1 x r b v r hn 1 x r 1 p b v r hn 1 qrq rq b v r hn 1 qr q r q h n 1 qr q bq k r q k field of fractions of v by theorem 3 5 we have homrq bq k rq 6 0 homrq bq k r q 6 0 homr q bq k r q r q 6 0 hence by local duality it follows from above that hn 1 x b v 1 p 6 0 since is onto in 23 it follows that hn 1 x b v 6 0 now let us assume hn 1 x b r 6 0 by similar arguments as for exactness in 23 we obtain the following exact sequence hn 1 m b r h n 1 x b r h n 1 x b r 1 p h n m b r 0 24 by arguments as above we have hn 1 x b r 1 p h n 1 qrq bq rq 0 corollary to lemma 2 1 and hence hn 1 x b r 1 p 0 it follows from 24 that the sequence hn 1 m b r h n 1 x b r 0 is exact hence the assertion follows by part ii theorem 4 1 corollary if h 0 p h n 1 x b v 6 0 then h n 1 m b v 6 0 suppose h 0 p h n 1 x b v 6 0 then in the exact sequence 23 is not an isomorphism and hence hn 1 m b v 6 0 remark with notations as above if i is an ideal in r generated by a system of parameters of length n 1 such that p i then hn 1 i b r 0 and h n 1 i b v 0 this has been pointed out in part i of theorem 4 1 4 4 we here mention a couple of questions that came up during this study and whose answers we do not know at present local cohomology of module of differentials of integral extensions 21 1 let r m be a complete regular local ring of dimension n of equicharacteristic 0 and let b be its absolute integral closure is hn 1 m b r 6 0 2 let r m be a complete regular local ring of dimension n of mixed characteristic p with coefficient ring v and let b be its absolute integral closure let p x 1 xn 1 be a system of parameters of r such that x 1 xn 1 form a part of a regular system of parameters a is hn 1 x b r 6 0 b is h 0 p h n 1 x b v 6 0 remark it can be shown that an affirmative answer for b implies an affirmative answer for a references 1 m andre homologies des alge bres commutative springer verlag berlin hei delgerg new york 1974 2 y andre la conjecture de
