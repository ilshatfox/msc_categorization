hamidreza rahmati and rebecca r g abstract the main goal of this paper is to prove in positive characteristic p stability behavior for the graded betti numbers in the periodic tails of the minimal resolutions of frobenius powers of the homogeneous maximal ideals for most choices of hypersurface in three variables whose degree is the opposite parity to that of p we achieve this by developing a method to obtain the degrees of the generators of the defining ideal of a relatively compressed gorenstein artinian graded algebra from its socle degree introduction let r k x 1 xn f be a standard graded hypersurface ring over a field k with homogeneous maximal ideal m in this paper we study the question in positive characteristic p of how the free resolutions of the frobenius powers m pe x p e 1 x p e n are related to each other in view of the fundamental role that frobenius powers play in providing invariants of the ring in three variables kustin and ulrich made a fascinating computational observation that the periodic tails of these resolutions seem to eventually cycle as e increases and in fact sometimes stabilize in the case that r is a diagonal hypersurface that is for f xd 1 x d 2 x d 3 this behavior has successfully been determined by kustin rahmati and vraciu in krv 12 in addition they identify for which p and e the tails are infinite they prove similar results for the two variable case in this paper we prove that stability of the graded betti numbers holds for general choices of f the precise result is the following see theorem 5 10 in view of remark 2 8 theorem a let r k x y z f be a standard graded hypersurface ring over a field k of characteristic p 0 suppose that p and d deg f have opposite parity let q 1 q 0 be powers of p with q 0 d 3 then for general choices of f the graded betti numbers of the r modules r m q 0 and r m q 1 are the same up to a constant shift 3 2 q 1 q 0 1 moreover their eventually 2 periodic minimal graded free resolutions are of the

a holds for q 0 if f is very general see remarks 2 8 and 4 2 for a detailed discussion on why very general choices of f suffice in fact our experiments on the computer program macaulay 2 gs did not yield any example that failed the conclusion of theorem a we prove theorem a by first finding the relevant minimal graded resolutions over the polynomial ring see theorem 5 6 this also allows us to compute the hilbert kunz function as follows see theorem 5 11 in view of remark 2 8 the leading term agrees with the results of buchweitz and chen in bc 97 theorem b suppose that p and d have opposite parity and let q be a power of p for general choices of f the value of the hilbert kunz function of r at q is given by hk q 3 4 dq 2 1 12 d 3 d it would be very interesting to find what general principle lies behind this stabil ity phenomenon for the betti numbers and whether this behavior has connections with other invariants of singularities such as f signature and f pure threshold for which much is still unknown even for hypersurfaces the question of stability of the betti numbers is closely related to another ques tion of independent interest and indeed answering this question provides the key ingredient to our proof of theorem a the question is what is the behavior as e increases of the socles soc r x p e 1 x p e n where the socle of a module is the largest submodule that is a k vector space these socles have played a key role in other results such as in kv 07 the connection between the two problems is further evident in three variables indeed kustin and ulrich prove that in this case under some mild hypotheses the graded betti numbers of these quotients are the same up to a constant shift if and only if their socles are isomorphic as graded vector spaces up to the same shift see ku 09 1 1 our proof of theorem a which does not use kustin and ulrich s result relies on the following technical result in which we determine the socle behavior for general choices of f in fact in any number of variables the result as stated below follows from theorem 4 1 in view of remark 4 2 and yields the isomorphism of socles in corollary 4 8 note that in the statement s is even when p is odd and d is even or p 2 and n d is even s is odd when p is odd and d is odd or p 2 and n d is odd theorem c let r k x 1 xn f be a standard graded hypersurface ring over a field k of characteristic p 0 set d deg f and s n q 1 d assume that n 3 and q n d n 2 for general choices of f the following hold for the socle module soc r m q 1 its generators lie in degrees si 1 2 n q 1 d i i 2 if s is even 1 3 if s is odd betti numbers 3 2 if n 3 its dimension satisfies if s is even dimk soc r m q s 2 2 d if s is odd dimk soc r m q s 1 d and dimk soc r m q s 3 3 d 3 if n 4 its dimension is equal to a polynomial in q with leading term 2 n 2 n 2 n 2 n n 2 2 n 2 qn 2 for s even and bounded by a polynomial in q of degree n 2 for s odd furthermore the coefficients of these polynomials depend only on n and d note that in the three variable case the result is more explicit in that the exact dimension is determined for n 4 variables the socle dimensions are not nearly as well behaved which indicates that the story of high syzygies of frobenius powers of the maximal ideal is more complicated however there is a bound depending on q which can be derived from the proofs this result in any number of variables could be helpful in future investigations of frobenius powers we prove theorem c by considering the linked ideal j x q 1 x q n f in the polynomial ring p k x 1 xn as in krv 12 which defines a gorenstein artinian algebra by the theory of macaulay inverse systems such an algebra is determined by its associated inverse polynomial which turns out to be very simple in this setting see lemma 2 6 to investigate this algebra we develop a theory to describe some of the structure of p free resolutions of certain truncations of j more generally given a standard graded gorenstein artinian algebra a written as a quotient a p j of the polynomial ring p symk a 1 we use its associated inverse polynomial to determine the format of resolutions of quotients p j m by truncations of the ideal we do not find the minimal free resolutions explicitly but identify parts of the resolution as cohomologies of certain subcomplexes of koszul complexes however when a is relatively compressed with respect to a complete intersection ideal we prove that the first few such cohomologies vanish for m s 2 indeed this is the case in our setting j x q 1 x q n f for a general choice of f in any case this yields enough information that we can read off the degrees of the generators of j and so the application we have in mind goes through relatively compressed algebras are a useful generalization of compressed alge bras which have been studied for many years see definition 2 3 for the precise definition this newer concept appears for example in ci 01 iar 84 mmrn 05 in fact it is known that most artinian gorenstein ideals containing the complete intersection ideal are relatively compressed in the sense that general choices of in verse polynomial suffice zan 07 a zan 07 b however not much was known about their resolutions or even generators we extend the methods for compressed alge bras of el khoury and kustin in ekk 14 and miller and rahmati in mr 18 to find resolutions neither minimal nor completely explicit of p j m for every m in any characteristic see theorem 3 6 when p j is relatively compressed with respect to a complete intersection ideal and m s 2 where s is the socle degree of p j the beginning of the resolution becomes more explicit section 3 is dedicated to these results 4 c miller h rahmati and r r g in section 4 we apply the linkage theory to determine the desired socle degrees for theorem c from the resolution of the algebra p j m where j is the linked ideal x q 1 x q n f as a function of q whenever this is a relatively compressed gorenstein algebra with respect to the complete intersection ideal x q 1 x q n see remark 4 3 we also note the curious fact that the behavior of the resolutions of the frobenius powers for a general hypersurface can differ from that in the diagonal hypersurface case found in krv 12 for some degrees the diagonal hypersurface case is rel atively compressed and for some it is not see example 6 2 so while we were inspired by the results of kustin rahmati and vraciu our results are a comple mentary case rather than a generalization of their results the paper is organized as follows in section 1 we review the theory of inverse systems and establish some useful properties and in section 2 we prove some pre liminary results about algebras that are relatively compressed with respect to a complete intersection ideal resolutions of such algebras can be found in section 3 then in section 4 we apply this general theory of resolutions to prove our main results on the socle in section 5 for the relatively compressed case in 3 vari ables we compute some of the structure of the resolutions of the frobenius powers over the hypersurface ring and the hilbert kunz function of the hypersurface ring section 6 includes examples illustrating the stability behavior in both the general hypersurface case and the diagonal hypersurface case 1 inverse systems in 1918 macaulay described a one to one correspondence between gorenstein ar tinian algebras of the form p i where p k x 1 xn and cyclic r submodules of the ring of inverse polynomials k x 11 x 1 n later emsalem ems 78 and iarrobino iar 84 extended this correspondence to all artinian algebras p i and finitely generated p submodules of the ring of inverse polynomials as such the correspondence can be viewed as a version of matlis duality in view of nor 74 in characteristic zero they can equivalently be described using the ring of partial derivative operators all of these are now called macaulay s inverse systems see also eis 95 2 6 and ik 99 we describe this correspondence in the graded setting in the gorenstein case we use the divided power ring in place of the inverse polynomial ring since they are isomorphic as p modules consider a homogeneous gorenstein ideal i primary to the homogeneous maximal ideal x 1 xn so that a p i is a graded artinian gorenstein algebra every such ideal i has an explicit description as an annihilator of divided power polynomials as follows let v be a vector space of dimension d with basis x 1 xn let s v denote the symmetric k algebra which can be identified with p k x 1 xn and let d v denote the divided power k algebra that is d v homgdd k s v k i 0 homk s v i k which is a k vector space on the dual basis of monomials x i 1 1 x in n where x 0 i denotes 1 for all i recall that d v is a module over s v via x j 1 1 x jn n x i 1 1 x in n x i 1 j 1 1 x in jn n if in jn for all n 0 else betti numbers 5 1 1 remark in place of d v one could just as well use the ring of inverse polynomials k x 11 x 1 n with the analogous s v module structure that is with x i x i 0 whenever note that k x 11 x 1 n can be identified with the injective hull e k of k over r as proved by northcott in nor 74 and so the ideal obtained from an inverse system is actually the annihilator of a finitely generated k submodule of the injective hull we now describe the one to one correspondence between homogeneous goren stein ideals i of r with r i artinian and cyclic submodules of d v given a homogeneous element of d v let i 0 s v r s v r 0 which is a graded artinian ideal of r indeed all monomials of degree greater than s deg are in i and so r i s 0 conversely given a homogeneous artinian gorenstein ideal i of r let i 0 d v i d v i 0 it turns out that since i is artinian gorenstein i is a cyclic s v submodule of d v such an element is called an inverse system for i this correspondence between artinian gorenstein ideals in r and cyclic submod ules of d v was given by macaulay it was extended to the non cyclic finitely generated submodules in ems 78 and iar 84 1 2 example taking for the inverse system the divided polynomial x 2 y 2 z 2 one obtains the ideal i ann xy yz xz x 2 y 2 x 2 z 2 the main result in the theory of inverse systems is that these assignments are inverse to each other and that the type of the resulting algebra r i is equal to the minimal number of generators of the submodule i in particular any ho mogeneous artinian gorenstein ideal can be obtained in this way using a single homogeneous d v the degree of gives the socle degree of the resulting artinian algebra 1 3 we now lift the machinery of the inverse system from k vector spaces to free r modules let f be a free r module of rank d with basis x 1 xn we let s s f and d d f denote the symmetric r algebra and the divided power r algebra respectively we also set to denote the exterior r algebra f note that d has an s module structure analogous to the one described in remark 1 1 since k r is faithfully flat properties for the k vector spaces s v and d v transfer to the free r modules s and d in the obvious way given any homogeneous inverse polynomial in d v we can think of it as a polynomial in d by replacing each xi by xi it should not cause any confusion to call it in either case for any such inverse polynomial we get a collection of maps s 0 0 s 1 1 si i ss s ss 1 s 1 ds ds 1 ds i d 0 0 6 c miller h rahmati and r r g defined by i p p for p si and where s deg for more detail see mr 18 1 4 definition given an inverse polynomial we define d s m im sm m ds m note that each d s m is a free direct summand of ds m as p modules note further that rank d m rank d s m by lemma 1 5 and since dual maps have the same rank 1 5 lemma mr 18 let be a divided power polynomial of degree s the induced maps i si ds i satisfy the following properties for every integer i 1 homr i r s i 2 we have ker i coker s i by changing each exponent in a monomial in the kernel to a divided power 2 relatively compressed algebras in this section we recall the definitions of compressed and relatively compressed artinian algebras and translate them to certain properties of the maps i described in the previous section for the corresponding inverse system using this we give several criteria for an ideal to be relatively compressed with respect to a complete intersection ideal especially when the complete intersection ideal is a frobenius power of the maximal ideal x 1 xn first we recall the definition of compressed but only for the case of gorenstein algebras so that the reader can compare the two notions recall that the hilbert function of a graded algebra b is defined to be hi b dimk bi 2 1 definition a graded artinian gorenstein algebra p j whose socle is of degree s is said to be compressed if it satisfies 2 1 1 hi p j min hi p hs i p for i 1 s 2 2 iarrobino iar 84 3 4 see also boij and laksov bl 94 3 4 proves that being compressed holds generally even in the non gorenstein level case specifically for general choices of inverse system of divided power polynomials of the same degree the corresponding algebra is compressed the hilbert function of a compressed algebra is maximal among all the algebras with the same socle degrees in this paper the algebras we study are not compressed but satisfy a more gen eral condition called relatively compressed defined below the following definition with a slight change was also made for non gorenstein ideals but we only require the gorenstein case 2 3 definition ci 01 definition 2 2 let c p be a homogeneous complete intersection ideal such that p c is artinian let j p be a homogeneous goren stein ideal containing c we say that the algebra a p j or equivalently the betti numbers 7 ideal j is relatively compressed with respect to c if for every i hi p j takes on the maximum possible value i e hi p j min hi p c hs i p c where s is the degree of the socle of a since hi p c increases as i increases the minimum in the formula is hi p c for i 6 s 2 and hs i p c for i s 2 in particular note that the condition implies that ji c i in degrees i s 2 we say that a is relatively compressed with respect to c in degree i if hi p j min hi p c hs i p c in the next lemma we give an interpretation of the relatively compressed condi tion in terms of the maps i for the corresponding inverse system further when the complete intersection is x q 1 x q n we give an even more explicit version recall from 1 4 that d s m im m is a free summand of d s m 2 4 lemma let c p be a homogeneous complete intersection ideal such that p c is artinian and let c be the lift of c to the symmetric algebra s obtained by replacing each xi by xi let j p be a homogeneous gorenstein ideal containing c with inverse polynomial and let s be the degree of the socle of p j the following conditions are equivalent 1 j is relatively compressed with respect to c 2 for every i 6 s 2 equivalently for every i s 2 j is relatively compressed with respect to c in degree i 3 for i 6 s 2 the kernel of the map i si ds i equals the ith graded piece of the ideal c 4 for i s 2 the cokernel of the map i si ds i is generated minimally by the set c s i of inverse polynomials in ds i obtained from a minimal generating set of polynomials in cs i by changing all powers to divided powers 5 for every i equivalently for every i 6 s 2 or for every i s 2 one has an equality rank d i min rank si ci rank ss i cs i in particular when c x q 1 x q n and so c x q 1 x q n the conditions 3 and 4 translate to 3 for i 6 s 2 the kernel of the map i si ds i is generated by the mono mials xa 11 x an n in si with aj q for some 1 6 j 6 n 4 for i s 2 the cokernel of the map i si ds i is generated by the monomials x a 1 1 x an n in ds i with aj q for some 1 6 j 6 n proof first note that dimk ji rank ker i hi p j rank si ker i rank d s i hi p c rank si ci rank d i rank d s i 2 4 1 where the first two follow from 1 3 the third is obvious and the last one is from 1 4 and the fact that dual maps have the same rank therefore we also get 8 c miller h rahmati and r r g hi p j hs i p j hence 1 2 and 5 are equivalent since the relevant equations are unchanged if we replace i with s i furthermore 3 is equivalent to 4 by the duality of the maps i si ds i and s i ss i di for the proof of 5 implies 3 since i 6 s 2 we have rank d i rank si ci by hypothesis so since rank d i rank si ker i and ci ker i we get that ci ker i lastly note that 3 implies 2 by the second and third formulas in 2 4 1 2 5 remark the equivalences in lemma 2 4 remain valid for a fixed i as long as one rewrites any i s 2 as its dual value s i for the rest of this section assume that c x q 1 x q n first we give a concrete version of 5 in proposition 2 7 that is similar to 3 and 4 then we use it to show that in that case it is actually only necessary to confirm the relatively compressed condition or the equivalent condition in one degree see lemma 2 10 and corollary 2 11 for details this requires us to first obtain the inverse polynomial of j which turns out to be surprisingly simple 2 6 lemma for any gorenstein ideal j p that contains c x q 1 x q n there exists a homogeneous f p of degree d with 1 d q such that j is of the form j x q 1 x q n f the inverse polynomial of j is f x q 1 1 x q 1 n in inverse variables see remark 1 1 or the equivalent version in divided powers where x i has been replaced by x i equivalently is a linear combination of divided power monomials of degree s n q 1 with each variable having power strictly less than q in particular its degree is deg s n q 1 d where d deg f proof the first part follows from the theory of linkage it suffices to show that annp j x q 1 x q n f suppose that g annp this is equivalent to gf x q 1 1 x q 1 n 0 in the divided power ring this holds if and only if fg is a polynomial where each term has a factor of xai with a q for some i this is true if and only if fg x q 1 x q n if and only if g jq the last statement follows from the form of given above recall that an ideal j is relatively compressed with respect to a complete inter section ideal c in degree i if the following equality holds hi p j min hi p c hs i p c holds for that integer i by the arguments in the proof of lemma 2 4 see re mark 2 5 this is equivalent to the condition that the rank of the induced map i si d s i is equal to min hi p c hs i p c for that integer i for any fixed i s 2 or i s 2 respectively it is also equivalent to parts 3 and 4 respec tively of lemma 2 4 the following consequence of lemma 2 6 will turn out to be very useful later betti numbers 9 2 7 proposition let c x q 1 x q n for any a s 2 jq is relatively com pressed with respect to c in degree a if and only if the free submodule d s a ds a has basis given by all the inverse monomials x a 1 1 x an n of degree s a such that aj q for all j 1 n proof let a s 2 and set ys a k x a 1 1 x an n ai s a and aj q for all 1 6 j 6 n recall that d s a consists of the elements of ds a that can be written in the form g where g sa and f x q 1 1 x q 1 n by lemma 2 6 first notice that g has maximum degree q 1 in each xi since both f and g have only positive powers of the xi and xi respectively hence there is an inclusion d s a ys a by lemma 2 4 and remark 2 5 the ideal jq is relatively compressed with respect to c in degree a if and only if the divided power monomials x a 1 1 x an n with some ai q form a basis for the free module coker a ds a d s a hence d s a has the same vector space dimension as ys a in this case and we must have d s a ys a whenever jq is relatively compressed with respect to c in degree a 2 8 remark recall that for any fixed q pe and general choices of f of fixed degree d in p k x 1 xn the gorenstein ideal x q 1 x q n f is relatively compressed with respect to x q 1 x q n by a result of zanello indeed the condition is open since it can be described by the maps i s x q 1 x q n d being of maximal rank for 1 i s n q 1 d so it suffices to determine existence which is given in zan 07 a proposition 3 which in turn cites for proof the observation at the beginning of section 2 of zan 07 b and requires remark 2 15 at the end of his paper to be seen to be fully characteristic free in order to apply his result notice by the comment in lemma 2 6 that general choices of f yield general subject to the condition that the corresponding ideal contains the complete intersection ideal x q 1 x q n since this condition can easily be seen to be equivalent to consisting of a linear combination of monomials with each variable to a power strictly less than q 2 9 question one may ask whether general choices of f simultaneously yield relatively compressed ideals x q 1 x q n f for all q a stronger question is if the gorenstein ideal x q 1 x q n f is relatively compressed with respect to x q 1 x q n for some value of q does the same hold for all larger q this is a relatively concrete question in view of lemma 2 6 and proposition 2 7 the answer to a variant on this question is yes for very general choice of f when k is uncountable see remark 4 2 for details as a brief aside we use proposition 2 7 to obtain the following lemma whose corollary below gives a shortcut to deciding whether an ideal is relatively com pressed this generalizes a basic and useful lemma from the compressed case mr 18 2 10 lemma let c x q 1 x q n and let be a divided power polynomial of degree s if an ideal j is relatively compressed with respect to c in degree m for some integer m s 2 then j is relatively compressed with respect to c in degree m i for every integer i 0 10 c miller h rahmati and r r g proof suppose that j is relatively compressed with respect to c in degree m for some m s 2 we show that the rank of m i sm i d s m i is equal to min hm i p c hs m i p c for all i 0 set ya k x a 1 1 x an n ai a and aj q for all 1 6 j 6 n and recall that d a ya as explained in the proof of proposition 2 7 by the same proposition this containment is an equality for a s m we show that ys m i is in the image of m i which implies that d s m i ys m i we do this by forming the composition of maps of free r modules m i ys m i ys m d s m m sm sm i where the first map sends any divided power monomial x a 1 1 x an n to the monomial x a 1 b 1 1 x an bn n where bj min q aj 1 i j 1 t 1 bt the map m is a splitting of m and the last map sends a monomial x a 1 1 x an n to xa 1 b 11 x an bn n with the bj chosen as above note that since the exponents remain less than q under the first map the image lands in ys m d s m we show that m i gives a preimage for each monomial in ys m i m i m i x a 1 1 x an n m i xb 11 x bn n m x a 1 b 1 1 x an bn n m i m x a 1 b 1 1 x an bn n xb 11 x bn n m m x a 1 b 1 1 x an bn n xb 11 x bn n x a 1 b 1 1 x an bn n x b 1 1 x bn n x a 1 1 x an n where the second equality follows from the commutativity of the symmetric algebra s and the third one holds because d is an s module hence m i surjects onto ys m i and so indeed d s m i ys m i so we have in fact constructed an r module homomorphism m i splitting m i since these monomial form a basis of d s m i using lemma 1 5 and lemma 2 4 we get the following as an immediate corollary 2 11 corollary let c x q 1 x q n and let be a divided power polynomial of degree s if jq is relatively compressed with respect to c in degree s 2 then jq is relatively compressed with respect to c 3 resolutions of relatively compressed ideals in this section given an ideal j that is relatively compressed with respect to a complete intersection ideal our goal is to determine the form of the resolution of and the degrees of the minimal generators of j we will describe all possible degrees of the generators of an ideal that is not necessarily relatively compressed see corollary 3 8 we do this using macaulay s inverse system we begin by giving an outline of the process that we use first we see immediately from the definition of relatively compressed that in degrees n s 2 the only generators are the complete intersection generators which must be there and nothing else betti numbers 11 next in order to obtain the generators in degrees n s 2 we use the methods in miller rahmati in mr 18 section 6 to obtain a resolution of the truncated ideal j s 2 that is the ideal jq in degrees greater than or equal to s 2 the beginning of the resolution turns out to be explicit enough to read off the degrees and if deg f is even the number of the generators in degrees n s 2 unlike in section 6 of that paper here we are able in this setting to prove that the images of certain maps split out of the target this enables us to simplify the resulting multi complex at each step by taking kernels and cokernels as was done in the compressed case ekk 14 in order to explain this modified process we discuss the construction more concretely subsequently we show that some of these cokernels vanish and hence we determine the degrees of the generators of j the defining ideal of the algebra before we begin constructing the resolution we introduce the basic building blocks involved and determine that they are free 3 1 definition in be 75 buchsbaum and eisenbud construct minimal free reso lutions of powers of ideals that are generated by regular sequences we recall the special case of their construction for powers of the homogeneous maximal ideal m of p here all tensor products are over p we begin by describing the free p modules involved in their resolutions they arise as kernels in strands of the general koszul complex k x 1 xn s on the symmetric algebra s p x 1 xn more precisely the homogeneous strands look like a 1 sb 1 a 1 b 1 a sb a b a 1 sb 1 where a b n and denotes the exterior p algebra f on the free p module f of rank d and the differential is given by a b xi 1 xia p a j 1 1 jxi 1 x ij xia xijp the p dual of this complex is isomorphic to the koszul complex k x 1 xn d for the variables on the s module d its homogeneous strands are of the form n a 1 db 1 n a 1 b 1 n a db n a b n a 1 db 1 if a b 1 these sequences are split exact and so all kernels equivalently images are free p modules this follows from the fact that x 1 xn is an exact sequence on s see also be 75 prop 2 2 with this in mind define la b ker a b im a 1 b 1 a sb ka b ker a b im a 1 b 1 a db these are schur and weyl modules corresponding to hooks define complexes lm 0 ln 1 m kos 1 ln 2 m kos 1 l 0 m p 0 km 0 p kn 1 m kos 1 kn 2 m kos 1 k 0 m 0 where kos is the restriction of the differential on the koszul complex k x 1 xn p 12 c miller h rahmati and r r g is induced by the map l 0 m s p x 1 xn s v k x 1 xn p that sends xi to xi for each i and is its dual 3 2 in be 75 buchsbaum and eisenbud show that lm is the minimal p free reso lution of r mm taking duals one sees that 3 2 1 hom lm p km 1 is the minimal p free resolution of extnp p m m p next we recall the new ingredients introduced in mr 18 that are needed for our resolutions of noncompressed algebras 3 3 definition recall that d s m im sm m ds m one can verify that 1 1 and so the restrictions of the maps give the subcomplex 3 3 1 i d s m i 1 d s m 1 this complex is no longer necessarily exact we denote the cycles by 3 3 2 k i s m ker i d s m i 1 d s m 1 which is a free summand of ki s m by the proof of proposition 3 4 we define the cokernels 3 3 3 ci s m coker i 1 d s m 1 k i s m notice that these cokernels are in fact the homologies of the subcomplex 3 3 1 3 3 4 ci s m hi i 1 d s m 1 i d s m furthermore they are always free as we show in proposition 3 4 one can verify that kos 1 kos 1 and so these modules fit together to make a subcomplex k s m 0 p k n 1 s m kos 1 k n 2 s m kos 1 k 0 s m 0 of the complex ks m where kn 1 m k n 1 m is any chosen projection to the summand next note that for every i the commutative diagram on the right below induces the map on kernels indicated on the left li m 1 m i sm 1 m i 1 sm 1 1 m 1 k i s m i d s m i 1 d s m 1 betti numbers 13 which we also denote by 1 m this induced map is not necessarily surjective note that the maps 1 and kos 1 commute and hence the induced map lm 1 m k s m ks m is a chain map in section 4 we show that in certain cases the modules ci s m are zero for i 0 1 see proposition 4 4 in general one can see that they are all free modules 3 4 proposition the p module k i s m and ci s m defined above are free for every i and m proof we show that the image of each map is a summand of ki s m for every i we have a commutative diagram i 1 sm 1 1 m 1 li m 1 m i 1 d s m 1 k i s m since and 1 m 1 are surjective the maps and 1 m have the same image furthermore we know that 1 m is represented by a matrix whose entries come from the coefficients of hence are units or equal to 0 and so its image is a summand of k i s m therefore the image of is also a summand of k i s m and so is free for all i m from the short exact sequences 0 k i s m i ds m im 0 and 0 im k i s m ci s m 0 we now conclude that k i s m and ci s m are free as well with these ingredients we now obtain a resolution of any standard graded gorenstein algebra in these resolutions the only nonexplicit modules and maps are coming from the cokernels c defined above the proof is modeled on that of the main result in mr 18 we note that when the algebra is compressed these cokernels always vanish by the remarks in definitions 3 1 and 3 3 since in that case d d when the algebra is not compressed they can be nonzero however further below we show that under certain assumptions some of these cokernels will vanish we first recall the proposition from mr 18 that is used in the proof for the explicit differentials in the resulting complex see mr 18 prop 2 1 3 5 proposition let r be a ring and let x x and y y be complexes of r modules and consider a chain map x y for each i let ai ker i bi im i and ci coker i 14 c miller h rahmati and r r g suppose that for every i 0 ai and bi are direct summands of xi and yi respectively which we display visually with choices of splitting maps as a 3 a 2 a 1 x 3 bb x 2 bb x 1 bb x 0 x 1 y 3 y 2 y 1 y 0 y 1 c 3 bb c 2 bb c 1 bb then the mapping cone of is homotopy equivalent to a complex of the form a 3 a 2 a 1 x 0 x 1 c 4 c 3 c 2 c 1 y 0 where the horizontal maps are those induced by the differentials x and y and the diagonal maps are a composition of maps in the following order the splitting from ci 2 to yi 2 the differential y yi 2 yi 1 the projection to the image bi 1 of i 1 the splitting of i 1 from bi 1 up to xi 1 the differential x xi 1 xi and for i 0 the projection to the summand ai in other words for i 0 the xi have been replaced by the kernels ai and the yi have been replaced by the cokernels ci at the cost of some induced snake lemma like maps ci 2 ai or c 2 x 0 if i 0 3 6 theorem for any standard graded artinian gorenstein algebra p j and every integer m 1 the mapping cone of the following chain map is a p free betti numbers 15 resolution of the quotient p j m of p by the truncated ideal j m 0 p ln 1 m 1 m 0 ss k n 1 s m wn 1 s m 1 k 0 k k 0 k l 2 m 1 m 0 ss k 2 s m w 2 s m 1 k 0 k l 1 m 1 m 0 ss k 1 s m w 1 s m 1 k 0 k l 0 m 1 m 0 ss k 0 s m w 0 s m 1 p 3 6 1 where wa b b j 0 ca j with ca j coker a 1 d j 1 k a j as defined in definition 3 3 and the vertical differentials along the complexes are induced by the differentials of l and k as follows k a s m wa s m 1 k 0 k k a 1 s m wa 1 s m 1 with the exception of the map proof we use a descending inductive process to go from a resolution of p j m 1 to a resolution of p j m as follows consider the short exact sequence 0 j m j m 1 p j m 1 p j m 0 and let f be a graded free resolution of p j m 1 then j m j m 1 is the graded component jm which is a k vector space say of dimension t and hence resolved by t copies et of the koszul complex e k x 1 xn p on the variables so for any lift f et f of the inclusion jm j m j m 1 p j m 1 the mapping cone of f is a free resolution of p j m in order to get an explicit lift we will use in place of et a mapping cone of koszul complexes that is quasi isomorphic to et namely e sm 1 m e d s m indeed since d s m is a free p module the surjection 16 c miller h rahmati and r r g sm m d s m is split and so the map e sm 1 m e d s m is also a split surjection hence it is homotopy equivalent in particular quasi isomorphic to its kernel which is the tensor product of e with the kernel of sm m ds m which is a free p module of rank t since its basis maps bijectively via to the minimal generators of jm see 1 3 for the base of the inductive process we begin with a resolution of p j s 1 note that in degrees s 1 and higher the ideal is equal to a power of the homogeneous maximal ideal more precisely j s 1 p s 1 m s 1 since js 1 ker ss 1 s 1 d 1 ss 1 ps 1 hence a free resolution of p j s 1 is given by the buchsbaum eisenbud complex ls 1 see definition 3 1 to proceed with the induction we can think of the base case resolution ls 1 as the mapping cone of 1 s 1 ls 1 k 1 since k 1 0 we note that when performing inductive steps the very first step from the base case of j s 1 to j s has a slightly different explanation since k 1 0 we will explain it separately at the end assume by induction that the resolution of p j m 1 is as given in the state ment and form the following diagram 3 6 2 in which the mapping cone of the right wall is the above mentioned resolution of p j m 1 and the mapping cone of the left wall is a free resolution of jm j m j m 1 since it is homotopy equivalent to et where t dimk jm as explained further above p n sm 1 m ww ln 1 m 1 1 m 1 tt n d s m 0 k n 1 s m 1 wn 1 s m 2 2 sm 1 m ww l 1 m 1 1 m 1 tt 2 d s m 0 k 1 s m 1 w 1 s m 2 1 sm 1 m vv l 0 m 1 1 m 1 ss 1 d s m 0 k 0 s m 1 w 0 s m 2 0 sm 1 m uu p ss 0 d s m 0 3 6 2 here wa b b j 0 ca j and ca j coker a 1 d j 1 k a j one can easily check that the induced map on the 0 th homologies agrees with the inclusion of j m j m 1 into p j m 1 therefore the total complex of the entire diagram is a resolution of p j m the final step of the inductive process is to simplify this diagram indeed proposition 3 5 enables us to simplify the front and back walls of the cube diagram betti numbers 17 3 6 2 assume first that m s so that the front right hand column containing k is not zero along the back wall the maps are surjective and have kernels equal to la m these maps are clearly split as each l is free along the front wall the kernels of the horizontal maps are k a s m and the cokernels are equal to k a s m 1 im wa s m 2 ca s m 1 wa s m 2 wa s m 1 note furthermore that k n j ln j and cn j vanish for all j these maps are split by proposition 3 4 although the map situated in homological degree 0 is not split putting these together proposition 3 5 yields that the totalization of di agram 3 6 2 is homotopy equivalent to the totalization of the following diagram where one can calculate that the map from p to k n 1 s m is the map in the complex ks m 0 p ln 1 m 1 m 0 ss k n 1 s m wn 1 s m 1 k 0 k k 0 k l 2 m 1 m 0 ss k 2 s m w 2 s m 1 k 0 k l 1 m 1 m 0 ss k 1 s m w 1 s m 1 k 0 k l 0 m 1 m 0 ss k 0 s m w 0 s m 1 p 3 6 3 in the case that m s the first inductive step from the base case m s 1 the right hand column of 3 6 2 is zero and we can simplify the diagram the same way along the back wall the maps are surjective and have kernels equal to la m along the front wall the kernels are simply equal to the left hand front column i d 0 which is in fact the complex k 0 note that n d 0 has rank 1 and therefore can be identified with p and also that wi s m 1 wi 1 0 this completes the inductive step and hence the proof to conclude this section we give the practical consequences of theorem 3 6 in particular we analyze the degrees of the maps in the resolution and then discuss 18 c miller h rahmati and r r g what can be deduced about the minimal resolution this information will be applied as the main tool in the proof of corollary 4 5 3 7 remark for convenience we rewrite the mapping cone from theorem 3 6 horizontally as follows where we have set t s m ln 1 m 1 0 l 1 m 1 0 l 0 m 1 0 p p k n 1 t wn 1 t 1 k 1 t w 1 t 1 k 0 t w 0 t 1 and note that in fact one always has w 0 t 1 0 by proposition 4 4 first let us understand the maps k 0 k in the second row of the diagram above better for each i recall that wi t 1 t 1 j 0 ci j and that each free module ci j splits out ofk i j which splits out of i dj both by proposition 3 4 so ci j and k i j have bases consisting of elements that are k linear combinations of elements of the form e g where e ek 1 eki is an exterior monomial of degree i and g is a divided power monomial of degree j the maps k k i t k i 1 t and k wi t 1 wi 1 t 1 take each such basis element to a sum of elements of the form re g where r m m 2 i e r is homogeneous of degree 1 e is an exterior monomial of degree i 1 and g is a divided power monomial of degree t the map wi t 1 k i 1 t is more complicated if one follows carefully each application of proposition 3 5 in the proof of theorem 3 6 one sees that the map is a composition of the induced maps from cokernels to kernels that is the diagonal maps in the conclusion of the proposition recall that these maps are a composition of maps ignoring the various projections which don t change the degrees of the coefficients starting with the differential on k i t wi t 1 which we can assume we understand by induction on t followed by the splitting of 0 and last by the map kos 1 so a basis element of each summand ci j for j 0 t 1 maps under to an element of k i 1 t that is a sum of elements of the form re g where r mt j 1 mt j 2 i e r is homogeneous of degree t j 1 e is an exterior monomial of degree i 1 and g is a divided power monomial of degree t altogether taking j 0 t 1 we see that the basis of w 1 t 1 maps to sums of elements of the form re g where r mj mj 1 with 2 j t 1 i e r is homogeneous of degree j e is an exterior monomial of degree i 1 and g is a divided power monomial of degree t next we apply proposition 3 5 once again this time to reduce the resolution in the diagram above to a minimal one indeed since the coefficients of are units one can show that the vertical maps 1 0 are completely split the kernels and images the maps 1 0 split out of their domains and codomains respectively although reducing the entire resolution in general is too complicated without more knowledge of these kernels and cokernels we can say something about the degrees of the maps that result in particular we analyze the beginning of the resolution in order to determine the degrees of generators of j m betti numbers 19 looking at the maps resulting from the proposition and considering the discus sion above one arrives at the following conclusion choose a splitting of the surjective map l 0 m 1 k 0 t 3 8 corollary for any standard graded gorenstein algebra p j a homogeneous generating set of j m is given by a union of the following sets the image under the map of a basis of ker 1 l 0 m k 0 t the image under the composition k of a lift to k 1 t of a basis of coker 1 l 1 m k 1 t and the image under the composition of a basis of w 1 t 1 their respective degrees are m m 1 m j with 2 j t 1 in our main application to frobenius powers in the next section the generators of the ideal j in degrees less than or equal to s 2 are known and to obtain the generators in higher degrees we prove that w 1 t 1 0 for m s 2 see corollary 4 5 so that we obtain all the generators of j m from corollary 3 8 4 socle result let k be a field of positive characteristic p and let p k x 1 xn be the polynomial ring with homogeneous maximal ideal x x 1 xn p when n 3 we use x y z instead for the variable names for any nonzero homo geneous polynomial f p of degree deg f d let r p f be the hypersurface ring and let m denote the image of x in r we study the betti numbers of the ideals m pe x p e 1 x p e n r of r we will use the notation q pe whenever it does not cause confusion in this section we study the socle of r m q for general choices of f in any number of variables recall that as shown in ku 09 1 1 in three variables the behaviour of the socles of the frobenius powers of a gorenstein ideal determines whether the betti numbers are stable as the frobenius power increases so we apply our results from this section to the study of free resolutions of the frobenius powers of the maximal ideal of r the result as stated below follows from remark 4 3 and proposition 4 6 note that in the statement s is even when p is odd and d is even or p 2 and n d is even s is odd when p is odd and d is odd or p 2 and n d is odd 4 1 theorem let r k x 1 xn f be a standard graded hypersurface ring over a field k with homogeneous maximal ideal m set q pe d deg f and s n q 1 d 20 c miller h rahmati and r r g assume that n 3 and q n d n 2 assume further that the linked goren stein algebra k x 1 xn x q 1 x q n f is relatively compressed with respect to the complete intersection ideal x q 1 x q n then the following hold for the socle module soc r m q 1 its generators lie in degrees si 1 2 n q 1 d i i 2 if s is even 1 3 if s is odd 2 if n 3 its dimension satisfies if s is even dimk soc r m q s 2 2 d if s is odd dimk soc r m q s 1 d and dimk soc r m q s 3 3 d 3 if n 4 its dimension is equal to a polynomial in q with leading term 2 n 2 n 2 n 2 n n 2 2 n 2 qn 2 for s even and bounded by a polynomial in q of degree n 2 for s odd furthermore the coefficients of these polynomials depend only on n and d 4 2 remark for any fixed power q for general choices of f p k x y z the gorenstein ideal xq yq zq f of p is relatively compressed with respect to xq yq zq by a result of zanello see the discussion in remark 2 8 hence the relatively compressed condition in theorem 4 1 holds generally for q 0 and q 1 or indeed for any finite set of values of q note therefore to get condition 1 to hold for all values of q one only needs f to be very general that is f is in a countable intersection of zariski open sets of polynomials of some fixed degree d so if k is an algebraically closed field this would mean very general f should work i e randomly chosen choices should work see also the discussion in question 2 9 hence the main goal of this section is to obtain the socles including the num ber of generators and their degrees of the quotient rings r m q for which the gorenstein ideal xq f of p is relatively compressed with respect to the com plete intersection ideal xq in fact we obtain such information for any number of variables not just 3 our strategy for achieving this is as follows first we rewrite the quotient rings as r m q p iq where iq x q f as in kustin rahmati vraciu krv 12 we consider the link of iq in p via the complete intersection ideal c as follows 4 2 1 jq x q p iq x q p f since jq is linked to an almost complete intersection ideal iq it follows that jq is a gorenstein ideal that is p jq is a gorenstein ring there is a useful connection between the socle degrees of p iq and the degrees of the generators of its link jq betti numbers 21 4 3 remark let p k x 1 xn and let f be a homogeneous polynomial in p let x x 1 xn and iq x q f x q 1 x q n f assume that x q 1 x q n are part of a minimal generating set for the gorenstein ideal jq x q iq for any basis u 1 u of the socle of p iq there are homogeneous elements v 1 v in p such that x q 1 x q n v 1 v minimally generate jq and ui vi n q 1 see for example kv 07 1 4 in particular one has jq dimk socp iq n note that the converse also holds that is if x q 1 x q n v 1 v is a minimal set of homogeneous generators for jq there are elements u 1 u in p iq with ui vi n q 1 that form a basis for the socle of p iq we will apply this remark to deduce corollary 4 8 from proposition 4 6 in view of remark 4 3 it suffices to find the number and degrees of minimal homogeneous generators of the linked ideal j defined in 4 2 1 for the rest of this section we assume that f is chosen so that jq is relatively compressed with respect to the complete intersection ideal x q 1 x q d for the theorem we apply the results below for q q 0 and q q 1 in particular by the literature as described in the introduction and remark 4 2 for general choices of f the ideal jq will have this property recall from lemma 2 6 that the inverse polynomial of jq is f x q 1 1 x q 1 n in inverse variables see remark 1 1 or the equivalent version in divided powers where each x ij j has been replaced by x ij j its degree equals deg s n q 1 d where d deg f our strategy for finding the number and degrees of the generators of jq is as follows recall that since jq is relatively compressed with respect to a complete in tersection ideal xq its minimal homogeneous generators besides those of xq lie in degrees greater than or equal to s 2 see the remark in definition 2 3 or lemma 2 4 3 for the ideal jq we figure out the number and degrees of these additional generators by determining the beginning of the resolution of p jq s 2 via proposition 3 6 in this case the unknown cokernels in the beginning part of the resolution turn out to be zero by the following result we note that we cannot find an explicit resolution of p jq since the appropriate cokernels no longer vanish in degrees below s 2 we now show that the modules wi s m 1 in the diagram 3 6 1 are zero for i 0 1 recall from definition 3 3 that ci s m 1 coker i 1 d s m k i s m 1 4 4 proposition assume the notation above for all m 6 s 1 one has c 0 s m 1 0 moreover if jq is relatively compressed with respect to x q 1 x q n then c 1 s m 1 0 for every m s 2 1 22 c miller h rahmati and r r g proof we begin with c 0 s m 1 it is easy to see that the map 1 d s m 0 d s m 1 k 0 s m 1 is surjective indeed since by definition d s m 1 im m 1 it is enough to show that for any monomial generator g of sm 1 the product g is in the image of to see this suppose that xi is a variable appearing in the monomial g then one has ei g xi xi g xi xi g xi g where the last equality is because d is an s module to prove the second assertion we first calculate the differential on each basis element of 1 d s m 1 as follows first recall from proposition 2 7 that a basis for d s m 1 is given by the monomials x a 1 1 x an n of degree s m 1 with each exponent satisfying 0 ak q for each i 1 n and each such monomial we have ei x a 1 1 x an n 1 x a 1 1 x ai 1 i x an n if ai 1 0 if ai 0 since the elements 1 x b 1 1 x bn n with 0 bi q 1 form a basis of 0 d s m 2 the kernel k s m 1 is clearly generated by the cycles ei x a 1 1 x 0 i x an n for 1 i d and 0 ak q 1 and the cycles ei x a 1 1 x ai 1 i x aj j x an n ej x a 1 1 x ai i x aj 1 j x an n for 1 i j d and 1 ak q 1 the latter of these cycles is the image of ei ej x a 1 1 x ai i x aj j x an n under for the former cycles note that aj d q 1 2 implies that aj q 1 for some j 6 i assume without loss of generality that j i else one just needs an additional minus sign then one has ei x a 1 1 x 0 i x an n ej ei x a 1 1 x aj 1 j x 0 i x an n as desired under the assumption that jq is relatively compressed with respect to x q 1 x q n and q 6 s 2 lemma 2 4 applies to the ideal jq and tells us that the minimal homoge neous generators of jq in degrees i s 2 are simply x q 1 x q n the next proposition assures us that any additional generators in degrees i s 2 lie only in certain degrees 4 5 corollary let p k x 1 xn with n 3 assume the notation above and assume that jq is relatively compressed with respect to the ideal x q 1 x q n for some q with q d n n 2 so that q 6 s 2 then the minimal homogeneous generators for jq in degrees i s 2 lie in degree s 2 1 when s is even and in degrees s 2 and s 2 1 when s is odd proof in view of proposition 4 4 it follows from theorem 3 6 for m s 2 as explained at length in its unpacking in remark 3 7 and summarized in corollary 3 8 that the generators of jq m lie in degrees m and m 1 but by definition of betti numbers 23 relatively compressed the only minimal generators of jq in degrees less than or equal to m are x q 1 x q n so the minimal generators of jq lie in degrees q m and m 1 if furthermore s is even then since s 2 s 2 and j is relatively compressed there are in fact no generators of jq in degree m the next question is how many such additional generators are there beyond the obvious ones x q 1 x q n this is answered by the following result 4 6 proposition let p k x 1 xn with n 3 assume the notation above and assume that jq is relatively compressed with respect to the ideal x q yq zq for some q with q n d n 2 so that q 6 s 2 then x q 1 x q n are part of a minimal set of generators and the number of remaining generators is described below if n 3 and s is even then jq has exactly 2 d additional minimal generators in degree s 2 1 and no others of higher degree if n 3 and s is odd then jq has exactly d additional minimal generators in degree s 2 it also has at most 3 d additional generators in degree s 2 1 and no others of higher degree if n 4 its dimension is equal to a polynomial in q with leading term 2 n 2 n 2 n 2 n n 2 2 n 2 qn 2 for s even and bounded by a polynomial in q of degree n 2 for s odd furthermore the coefficients of these polynomials depend only on n and d proof recall that by lemma 2 6 s n q 1 d by corollary 4 5 we know in which degrees the generators lie it remains to determine the number in each degree when s is even we check the number of generators of jq in degree s 2 1 and demonstrate that it does not depend on q when s is odd we check the number of generators of jq in degree s 2 and demonstrate that it does not depend on q in this case there are additional generators in degree s 2 1 and the number of generators may depend on q first we examine the case where n 3 and s is even set a s 2 we are expecting new generators of jq in degree a 1 we find the dimension of jq in degree a 1 which is just the rank of the kernel of the map a 1 sa 1 da 1 we count ranks along the exact sequence 0 ker a 1 sa 1 a 1 da 1 coker a 1 0 the ranks of sa 1 and da 1 are a 1 2 2 and a 1 2 2 respectively the cokernel of a 1 is the same as the kernel of the dual map a 1 sa 1 da 1 which has basis given the monomial generators of x q 1 x q 2 x q 3 x 1 x 2 x 3 a 1 q so it has 3 a 1 q 2 2 generators there are also 3 a 1 q 2 2 generators of jq in degree a 1 that are multiples of the old generators x q 1 x q 2 x q 3 and do not interest us subtracting we are left with a 1 2 2 a 1 2 2 3 a 1 q 2 2 3 a 1 q 2 2 generators this expression simplifies to 2 d generators independent of q 24 c miller h rahmati and r r g next we examine the case where n 3 and s is odd set a s 1 2 s 2 first we consider the new generators of jq in degree a 1 we have a rank of a 1 2 2 for sa 1 and a rank of a 2 2 for da the cokernel has rank equal to the kernel of the dual map sa da 1 note that s a 1 a which has rank 3 a q 2 2 lastly there are 3 a 1 q 2 2 generators coming from x q 1 x q 2 x q 3 that we discount we are left with a 1 1 2 a 2 2 3 a q 2 2 3 a 1 q 2 2 generators in degree a 1 which simplifies to d generators independent of q next we consider the new generators of jq in degree a 2 by a similar process we get a 2 2 2 a 1 2 2 3 a 1 q 2 2 3 a 2 q 2 2 generators minus whatever new generators came from the degree a 1 piece of jq if we call this number of new generators gq this gives us 3 d gq generators lastly we consider the case that n 4 we give the details when s is even when s is odd the proof follows from a modification analogous to the one above for n 3 set a s 2 we are expecting new generators of jq in degree a 1 as in the 3 variable case we use the same exact sequence to compute the dimension of jq in degree a 1 then subtract the portion from the ideal x q 1 x q n finally obtaining 4 6 1 a 1 n 1 n 1 a 1 n 1 n 1 n a 1 q n 1 n 1 n a 1 q n 1 n 1 the first 2 terms can be simplified to 1 n 2 a n 2 n 3 2 a n 1 n 2 1 n 3 an 3 lower order terms 2 a n 2 n 2 an 2 lower order terms where we note that lower order in a is equivalent to lower order in q similarly after we factor out n from the last 2 terms the remaining quantities can be simplified to the same thing with a q substituted for a as a s 2 n q 1 d 2 the expression 4 6 1 simplifies to give the desired asymptotic result we remark that for s odd we are not sure whether gq depends on q 4 7 remark for polynomial rings with four or more variables in contrast to the three variables case the dimension of the socle of r m q depends on q even when s is even one can see this almost with any random choice of f and q s 2 that is q deg f n n 2 as we mentioned in the introduction a result of kustin and ulrich in ku 09 says that under some mild conditions two frobenius powers of the maximal ideal have the same betti numbers if and only if their quotient rings have isomorphic socles in section 5 we show when two frobenius powers of the maximal ideal have the same betti numbers in the next result we directly verify the corresponding isomorphism of socles from ku 09 1 1 without the mild hypotheses in their result betti numbers 25 4 8 corollary assume the notation above and assume that jq is relatively com pressed with respect to xq yq zq for all q q 0 with q 0 deg f 3 i e q 0 6 s 2 if s is even or if s is odd and the number of generators of jq in degree s 2 1 does not depend on q then for every q socr m q 0 q socr m q 0 3 2 q 0 q 1 are isomorphic as graded vector spaces proof set q pe and q 0 p e 0 we calculate soc r m q for any q pe q 0 and then specify to the values q q 0 and q qq 0 p e e 0 to obtain the desired result to do this recall that r i q p iq and apply remark 4 3 with i iq j jq and xq x q 1 x q n to obtain the degrees of the generators of soc r m q from the degrees generators of the link jq note that the socle degree of the complete intersection is p xq is 3 q 1 by proposition 4 6 plus the additional hypothesis when s is odd the number of generators of jq in each degree does not depend on q hence the dimension of soc r m q does not either the degrees of the generators of jq do however depend on q first suppose that s is even the same proposition yields that the socle generators have degrees equal to 4 8 1 3 q 1 1 2 3 q 1 d 1 1 2 3 q 1 d 1 where d deg f now suppose that s is odd then the socle generators have degrees 3 q 1 1 2 3 q 1 d 1 2 3 q 1 d 1 2 or 3 q 1 1 2 3 q 1 d 1 1 2 3 q 1 d 3 2 4 8 2 plugging in q q 0 and q q 0 q p e e 0 and subtracting one obtains degree shifts equal to 1 2 3 pe e 0 1 d t 1 2 3 pe 0 1 d t 3 2 pe e 0 pe 0 3 2 pe 0 pe 1 3 q 0 q 1 2 where t 1 2 1 or 3 2 the last assertion follows from the fact that p xq 0 is resolved by the koszul complex and therefore its back twist is b 3 q 0 5 application to frobenius powers we now specialize to the case of three variables where our socle results are strongest applying these to obtain graded betti numbers of frobenius powers of the maximal ideal and hilbert kunz functions let r p f with p k x y z be a standard graded hypersurface ring over a field k of characteristic p 0 with homogeneous maximal ideal x such that f x 2 in this section for sufficiently randomly chosen polynomials f we find the format of the free resolutions of the quotients r m q by the frobenius powers of m over both rings p and r as well as the structure of each associated matrix factorization 26 c miller h rahmati and r r g which turns out to be a pair of alternating matrices one of which is linear with pfaffian equal to f and the hilbert kunz function for m in fact we prove these results for all f with the property that xq f is relatively compressed with respect to xq recall that general choices of f have this property the organization of the section is as follows in the first part we explore what can be said without any generalness assumptions on f specifically about the resolution over p using linkage the buchsbaum eisenbud structure theorem for gorenstein ideals of codimension three and the corresponding dg algebra structure in the sec ond part we determine the structure of the resolution over r using the construction of shamash eisenbud avramov buchweitz in the third part for suitably general f we apply this in concert with theorem 4 1 to deduce theorem 5 8 on the sta bility of betti numbers of frobenius powers of the maximal ideal in the fourth part again for suitably general f we use these results to compute the hilbert kunz function of the maximal ideal in theorem 5 11 in the first two parts we develop resolutions for any complete intersection ideal not just xq yq zq in the last two parts we specialize to the case of xq yq zq for our applications 5 1 notation let d deg f and let q be a power of p in this section we work with the following graded ideals of the polynomial ring p the complete intersection ideal c c 1 c 2 c 3 where deg ci ri and the linked ideals i c f and j c i since i is an almost complete intersection ideal p j is a gorenstein ring later in parts 3 and 4 of this section we will specialize to the case c xq xq yq zq and the linked ideals iq x q f xq yq zq f and jq x q iq so that we can apply the results from section 4 when it is not likely to cause confusion we write i j for iq jq respectively assume c 1 c 2 c 3 are part of a a minimal generating set for j this holds automatically in the special case if we assume that jq is relatively compressed with respect to xq yq zq and q d 3 see remark 5 9 for details fix a set of minimal generators for j as follows j c 1 c 2 c 3 w 1 wm so m j 3 part 1 resolutions over p in this section we construct the p free resolutions of p i in terms of those of p j via the theory of linkage we follow the ideas and techniques from avramov avr 81 using the dg algebra structure defined by buchsbaum and eisenbud in be 77 4 to derive explicit formulas for our particular situation see also avr 78 section 8 4 note also that the results are similar but derived in the opposite order to those in krv 12 lemma 2 3 betti numbers 27 first recall that since p j is gorenstein of codimension three and its resolution is given by the well known buchsbaum eisenbud structure theorem for the reader s convenience we now modify the proof given in bh 93 theorem 3 4 1 b to make it valid in the graded setting and for the order of generators for j that we prefer 5 2 lemma buchsbaum eisenbud be 77 graded version there is a graded p free resolution of p j of the form 0 p 3 p 3 pm 2 p 3 pm 1 p 0 where 1 c 1 c 2 c 3 w 1 w 2 wm 3 t 1 and the map 2 is given by an alternating matrix which we can describe as x t where is a 3 3 block is m 3 and is m m and furthermore the jth entry of 1 equals 1 j 1 pfj x for each j 1 m 3 proof take a graded minimal free resolution f 0 f 3 f 2 f 1 f 0 0 of p j fixing bases e 1 em 3 and c of f 1 and f 0 r respectively so that the ei map to the generators c 1 c 2 c 3 w 1 wm of j by bh 93 3 4 3 we can assume there is a possibly non associative graded product on f in particular we get pairings fi f 3 i f 3 p and by tensor hom adjointness this gives us graded homomorphisms si fi homp f 3 i f 3 f 3 i by bh 93 3 4 4 we get an isomorphism of complexes t f f where ti si consequently the elements s 1 e 1 s 1 em form a basis for f 2 let f 1 fm be a basis for f 2 such that f i s 1 ei by construction and by the properties given in bh 93 we have fiej ijg where g is the basis element for f 3 such that s 3 g f 0 is the dual of c f 0 the rest of the proof follows as in bh 93 page 124 5 3 definition let x be a skew symmetric also known as alternating matrix we denote by pfi 1 ij x the pfaffian of the matrix obtained from x by removing the rows and columns indexed by i 1 ij the pfaffian adjoint of x denoted x is the alternating matrix with entries x i j 1 i jpfij x i j 0 i j 1 i j 1 pfij i j 5 4 definition buchsbaum and eisenbud define a dg algebra structure on their resolutions be 77 4 the formulas that we recall here are taken from avr 78 section 8 4 let c bi m 3 i 1 and ai m 3 i 1 be the standard bases for the free 28 c miller h rahmati and r r g modules respectively from left to right in the resolution in lemma 5 2 for 1 i j m 3 define the products aiaj 2 d 3 p 1 ijp pfijp x bp bhai aibh ihc where ijp is the sign of the permutation sending the numbers 1 2 m 3 to the numbers i j p followed by the remaining numbers in increasing order if i j and p are distinct and 0 otherwise these induce a dg algebra structure on the minimal free resolution of p j in order to find a resolution of p i via linkage theory as developed algebraically in ps 74 we need an explicit map from the koszul complex on the complete inter section ideal c to the resolution of p j lifting the natural surjection p c p j we will use the dg algebra structure defined above to achieve this 5 5 proposition let f be the free resolution of p j from lemma 5 2 with and as defined there let k be the koszul complex k c 1 c 2 c 3 p then there is a lifting of the identity map k 0 f 0 to a map of complexes k f such that in the standard basis of the koszul complex and the basis for f given in lemma 5 2 1 1 is given by the matrix i 3 0 where i 3 is the 3 3 identity matrix 2 2 is given by the product of matrices pf i 3 i 3 where i 3 is the 3 3 identity matrix with middle entry changed to 1 and 3 3 is multiplication by pf proof consider the koszul complex k k c 1 c 2 c 3 p 0 p d 3 p 3 d 2 p 3 d 1 p 0 resolving p c over p by using the dg algebra structures of the two resolutions k and f we will construct a map of complexes k f given by 0 p d 3 3 p 3 d 2 2 p 3 d 1 1 p 0 0 0 p 3 p 3 pm 2 p 3 pm 1 p 0 that lifts the identity map in homological degree 0 first let t 1 t 2 t 3 be the basis elements of k 1 that are sent to c 1 c 2 c 3 in p to make the right hand square commute set ti ai for i 1 2 3 this determines the map 1 whose matrix is i 3 0 where i 3 is the 3 3 identity matrix betti numbers 29 then as the koszul complex is a free graded dg algebra on t 1 t 2 t 3 and f is a dg algebra with structure as described in definition 5 4 this map extends uniquely to a map of dg algebras k f we now compute it explicitly on the bases t 1 t 2 t 1 t 3 t 2 t 3 in degree two and t 1 t 2 t 3 in degree three first we find 3 since is a dg algebra map we have 3 t 1 t 2 t 3 1 t 1 1 t 2 1 t 3 a 1 a 2 a 3 using the dg algebra structure on f described in definition 5 4 we find that 5 5 1 3 t 1 t 2 t 3 a 1 a 2 a 3 m 3 p 1 12 p pf 12 p x bp a 3 m 3 p 1 12 p pf 12 p x p 3 c 123 pf 123 x c pf 123 x c pf c similarly to find 2 we compute 2 t 1 t 2 1 t 1 1 t 2 a 1 a 2 m 3 p 1 12 p pf 12 p x bp to find this sum we first compute the the first nonzero term 123 pf 123 x bp pf 123 x bp pf bp for the remaining terms we compute pf 12 p for p 4 expanding along the third row and column we get pf 12 p x m 3 4 6 p 1 x 3 pf 123 p x where if p and 1 if p and x 3 is the 3 entry of x thus pf 12 p x m 3 4 6 p 1 pf p this simplifies to m 3 4 1 x 3 1 p p where is the adjoint of and by definition p pf p if p 0 if p pf p if p hence one has pf 12 p x m 3 4 1 p x 3 p 30 c miller h rahmati and r r g notice that x 3 m 3 4 is the 3 rd row of t whereas p m 3 4 is the pth column of hence this simplifies to pf 12 p x 1 p t 3 p hence 2 t 1 t 2 pf b 3 m 3 p 4 12 p 1 p t 3 pbp pf b 3 m 3 p 4 t 3 pbp pf b 3 m 3 p 4 p 3 bp where the last equality follows because t t t this gives the third column of the matrix of 2 the computations of 2 t 1 t 3 and 2 t 2 t 3 are similar except that for the former one gets an extra minus sign hence the matrix of the map 2 p 3 p 3 pm is pf i 3 i 3 where i 3 is the 3 3 identity matrix with middle entry changed to 1 now we use the explicit map from proposition 5 5 to obtain the resolution of p i from that of the linked ring p j recall that are the blocks appearing in the middle matrix of the resolution of p j as defined in lemma 5 2 5 6 proposition assume that ri d for i 1 2 3 the minimal homogeneous resolution g of p i over p is of the form 0 p c vf p 3 p t vf i 3 w xq pm p 3 t pm 0 with pf vf for some unit v k c c 1 c 2 c 3 and w w 1 wm proof as the ideals i and j are linked via the complete intersection ideal c we use the method developed in ps 74 to go from a resolution of p j to one of p i starting with the map of complexes from proposition 5 5 we take the mapping cone and dualize it to get a resolution g of p i over p as the cone of 0 p oo p 3 d 3 oo p 3 d 2 oo p d 1 oo 0 oo 0 p oo 3 oo p 3 pm 3 oo 2 oo p 3 pm 2 oo 1 oo p 1 oo 0 oo 0 oo now the non minimal pieces of the resolution can be removed as follows 0 is the identity map so those copies of p are removed the map 1 identifies the two copies of p 3 so those can be removed as well from the formulas in proposition 5 5 we see betti numbers 31 that the maps 2 and 3 are minimal this yields a minimal resolution as the cone of the following diagram since the matrix of 2 equals x t x t 0 p oo p 3 d 3 oo 0 p oo 3 oo p 3 pm c w oo 2 oo pm t oo 0 oo in particular the sum of the images of 3 and d 3 must equal i f c by proposition 5 5 the map 3 is multiplication by pf and d 3 is given by the matrix c 1 c 2 c 3 in the dual of the usual basis for the koszul complex hence pf and f must generate the same ideal modulo c so we must have pf vf h 1 c 1 h 2 c 2 h 3 c 3 for some unit v p but by lemma 5 2 must be homogeneous and so pf is homogeneous since f is homogeneous and d ri for i 1 2 3 by assumption we must have hi 0 for all i hence pf vf as desired last if one changes basis on the p 3 in the top row by the matrix i 3 the map d 3 has matrix c 1 c 2 c 3 and the map 2 has matrix pf i 3 t vf i 3 t since t t t t as is alternating this agrees with the resolution in the statement once one notes that the sum mands in p 3 pm are now listed in the opposite order and one puts minus signs on the second row when forming the totalized complex we rewrite the resolution of p i from proposition 5 6 as follows for use in the next part p 3 c ss pm t oo w ww p pm kk ss p vf kk p 3 c oo vf i 3 ggppppppppppppp and rename the summands as follows to distinguish between the two free modules p 3 and likewise for pm 5 6 1 g 1 c ss g 2 t oo w ww g 0 g 3 kk ss g 1 vf kk g 2 c oo vf i 3 gg part 2 resolutions over r in this section we follow the classic construction of shamash sha 69 3 to obtain a minimal resolution of p i r c over r p f from the resolution over p given in part 1 for more details see also remark 2 2 1 and theorem 9 1 1 in avramov s exposition avr 10 32 c miller h rahmati and r r g we begin with the resolution g of p i from proposition 5 6 as rewritten in diagram 5 6 1 the first step is to find a null homotopy for multiplication by f on g 5 7 lemma with the notation above the following assignments define a null homotopy for multiplication by f on g 0 0 1 1 0 0 i 3 0 2 0 in other words define 0 1 on g 0 g 1 the identity map 1 i 3 on g 1 g 2 the identity map 2 on g 2 g 3 and all remaining maps between summands equal to 0 furthermore 2 0 proof using the formulas for the differential of g given in proposition 5 6 one can easily check that f using the fact that f i 3 recalled in definition 5 3 we are now ready to give the form of the r free resolution of r c p i 5 8 proposition assume that ri d for i 1 2 3 rm rm rm rm t r 3 c r 0 where by t and c above we mean the images in r of these p matrices in addition the homogeneous alternating matrix has pfaffian equal to vf for some unit v k and the pair of matrices over p is the matrix factorization of vf over p associated to the periodic portion proof we apply the construction of shamash sha 69 we take as input the reso lution g of p i from proposition 5 6 and the homotopy from lemma 5 7 let d r be the divided power r algebra on one variable call it t as 2 0 the construction requires no higher homotopies it yields a resolution of the form g p d r with differential given by 5 8 1 g t i g t i 1 g g t i 1 for g g i 0 one may rewrite this as follows set g g p r and note that on the underlying modules we have g p d r g r d r i 0 g r rt i each of whose summands is a copy of the complex g that is r 3 c ss rm t oo w ww r rm kk ss r 0 kk r 3 c oo 0 ggppppppppppppp equipping the direct sum of these with the shamash differential 5 8 1 we get that the totalization of the following diagram which consists of shifted copies of betti numbers 33 the diagram above is a resolution over r note that the sign in the formula for the differential changes the map i 3 in 1 to i 3 r 3 c tt rm t oo w yyss ss ss ss ss r rm jj tt r 0 jj r 3 c oo 0 ee r 3 tt i 3 ww rmoo yyss ss ss ss ss uu r 1 uu rm jj tt r jj r 3 oo ee i 3 ww uu 1 uu it is clear that one can reduce this to a minimal resolution by removing the parts identified under the maps 1 and i 3 in the picture to do this one rebuilds the complex as the limit of its subcomplexes i 0 g r rt i each built as a mapping cone from the previous one and each of which can be reduced to a minimal complex using proposition 3 5 it is easy to see all the relevant free modules drop out and the inherited differentials are what is listed there that is the induced differentials from cokernels to kernels in the statement of proposition 3 5 turn out to be zero here since their domain or codomain is zero the result is the desired complex part 3 conclusions for the relatively compressed case in this part we apply our technical results on the socles proved in section 4 under the further assumption that f is chosen generally or more precisely such that j is relatively compressed with respect to x q we use these to derive the graded betti numbers and facts about the matrix factorization in the next section we use these to determine various frobenius invariants we now specialize to the case c xq xq yq zq and the linked ideals iq x q f xq yq zq f and jq x q iq when it is not likely to cause confusion we write i j for iq jq respectively since j is relatively compressed with respect to xq yq zq and n d 3 the elements xq yq zq are part of a minimal generating set for jq see remark 5 9 for details fix a set of minimal generators for j as follows j xq yq zq w 1 wm so m j 3 the new information employed in this section is one of the main results from section 4 namely that when j is relatively compressed one has j 2 d 3 and hence m 2 d see proposition 4 6 34 c miller h rahmati and r r g 5 9 remark the mild hypothesis q 0 deg f 3 implies that q s 2 for all q q 0 which ensures that the generators xq yq zq lie in degree at most s 2 this is implicitly used in several results in comparison to previous sections this hypothesis is the n 3 case of q 0 d n n 2 5 10 theorem let r k x y z f be a standard graded hypersurface ring over a field k of characteristic p 0 with homogeneous maximal ideal m suppose that p and d deg f have opposite parity let q d 3 be a power of p assume further that the linked gorenstein algebra k x y z xq yq zq f is relatively compressed with respect to the complete intersection ideal xq yq zq then a the matrix in the matrix factorization from proposition 5 8 is a 2 d 2 d linear matrix with pfaffian equal to vf for some unit v k and its pfaffian adjoint is a 2 d 2 d matrix with entries of degree d 1 the matrix is 2 d 3 with entries of degree 1 2 q d 1 in particular the minimal graded resolution of p i r m q over r has the following eventually 2 periodic form r 2 d b d r 2 d b 1 r 2 d b t r 3 q xq r 0 where b 3 2 q 1 2 d 1 2 b the minimal graded resolution of p i over p from proposition 5 6 has the following form 0 p p 3 q p d p 2 d 3 2 q 1 2 d 1 2 p 3 q d p 2 d 3 2 q 1 2 d 1 2 0 proof we prove a in the process of proving b first note that the hypothesis that p and d deg f have opposite parity is equivalent to the socle degree s 3 q 1 d of p j being even we begin by determining the graded shifts in the resolution of p j from lemma 5 2 0 p 3 p 3 pm 2 p 3 pm 1 p 0 where 1 x q yq zq w 1 w 2 wm 2 x t and 3 t 1 as is well known the last shift sometimes called the backtwist is equal to s 3 3 q d see for example kv 07 cor 1 7 but by the hypotheses proposition 4 6 yields that m 2 d and degwi s 2 1 3 2 q 1 2 d 1 2 for each i 1 m therefore the minimal graded resolution has the form 0 p 3 q d 3 p 3 a pm b 2 p 3 c pm e 1 p 0 betti numbers 35 where a 3 q d q 2 q d b 3 q d degwi 3 2 q 1 2 d 1 2 c q e degwi 3 2 q 1 2 d 1 2 from this one deduces that is linear since e b 1 this can also be seen from the fact that m 2 d and pf vf so its pfaffian adjoint is a homogeneous matrix with entries of degree d 1 in addition is a homogeneous matrix of degree deg e a 1 2 q 1 2 d 1 2 from this one in combination with proposition 5 6 one gets the desired result equivalently one can redo the mapping cone argument in the proof there and track the resulting shifts note that for very general f such that p and d have opposite parity the results of theorem 5 10 hold for all q 0 by remark 4 2 if k is uncountable this is a nonempty set of polynomials f part 4 hilbert kunz function given a finitely generated graded k algebra r with respect to the homogeneous maximal ideal m the hilbert kunz function of r is defined as hkr q dimk r m q in mon 83 monsky shows that asymptotically these functions have the form of hkr q ehk r q r o qr 1 where r is the krull dimension of r the constant ehk r is called the hilbert kunz multiplicity of r we compute the hilbert kunz function of r for suitably general choices of f 5 11 theorem suppose that p and d have opposite parity if the gorenstein ideal x q f of p is relatively compressed with respect to the complete intersection ideal x q for some q then hk q 3 4 dq 2 1 12 d 3 d proof taking the alternating sum of the poincar series of the free modules in the resolution of p i from theorem 5 10 one sees that p i 1 1 t 3 3 tq 1 t 3 td 1 t 3 2 dtb 1 t 3 3 ta 1 t 3 2 dtb 1 1 t

evaluate this at t 1 which we achieve by taking the limit as t 1 via l h pital s rule this yields hk q p i 1 6 3 q q 1 q 2 d d 1 d 2 2 d b b 1 b 2 3 a a 1 a 2 2 d b 1 b b 1 1 6 3 q q 1 q 2 d d 1 d 2 6 d b b 1 3 a a 1 a 2 plugging in the values of b and a and simplifying yields the desired result in bc 97 it is shown that for general choices of f the hilbert kunz multiplic ity of r achieves the minimum possible value 3 4 d a similar result follows from theorem 5 11 if x q f is relatively compressed for q large enough or if k is uncountable and f is very general see remark 4 2 6 examples in this section we give some examples to illustrate the various types of stability phenomena that occur with respect to frobenius powers in each we contrast the behavior for a general polynomial with that for a diagonal hypersurface xd yd zd as studied in krv 12 furthermore the non diagonal polynomial in example 6 2 is general enough that it further displays the behavior described in theorem a in the introduction in fact it is easy to find such examples since most randomly chosen ones should be generic enough see remark 4 2 we set p k x y z with k z pz and r p f for each example we first use macaulay 2 to compute the degrees of the generators of the linked ideal jq x q yq zq f in order to check whether it is relatively compressed indeed using lemma 2 4 we know that the gorenstein ideal jq is relatively compressed with respect to the complete intersection ideal xq yq zq as long as its only graded generators in degrees i s 2 are xq yq zq unless q s 2 in which case as long as there are none then we display the effect on the resolutions by providing some of the graded betti tables for the r modules r m q again computed using macaulay 2 betti numbers 37 6 1 example let f xy 2 yz 2 zx 2 first let p 5 and so k z 5 z then there are nongraded isomorphisms syz r 3 r x 5 y 5 z 5 syz r 3 r x 25 y 25 z 25 syz r 3 r x 125 y 125 z 125 syz r 3 r x 625 y 625 z 625 coker x z 2 0 0 y y 2 xz 0 0 2 z 0 y 2 xz z 2 0 z 2 y 2 x and so perhaps the tails of the resolutions are in fact the same for all powers of p up to a graded shift from macaulay 2 we compute the generators of jq to be as follows for e 2 there are 3 generators of degree 25 namely x 25 y 25 z 25 3 generators of degree 35 and 1 generator of degree 36 for e 3 there are 3 generators of degree 125 namely x 125 y 125 z 125 3 generators of degree 185 and 1 generator of degree 186 so jq is relatively compressed with respect to the complete intersection x q yq zq for at least q 25 and q 125 and hence exhibit the expected stable betti number behavior the betti tables are below note that in the betti tables below the rows that are skipped are zero and the rows that do appear have their row number indicated at the left note also that since these resolutions are over a hypersurface and hence eventually periodic we only display columns up to homological degree 4 after which the pattern repeats e 1 0 1 2 3 4 total 1 3 4 4 4 0 1 4 3 6 3 1 7 1 3 3 8 1 e 2 0 1 2 3 4 total 1 3 4 4 4 0 1 24 3 36 3 1 37 1 3 3 38 1 however since p 5 and d 3 have the same parity we do not get the behavior described in theorem a in contrast take the diagonal hypersurface f x 5 y 5 z 5 and let p 7 so k z 7 z there are nongraded isomorphisms syz r 3 r x 7 y 7 z 7 syz r 3 r x 73 y 7 3 z 7 3 coker y 3 x 3 z 3 0 x 2 y 2 0 z 3 z 2 0 y 2 x 3 0 z 2 x 2 y 3 syz r 3 r x 72 y 7 2 z 7 2 syz r 3 r x 74 y 7 4 z 7 4 38 c miller h rahmati and r r g coker z 0 x 4 y 4 x y 4 z 4 0 y x 4 0 z 4 0 z y x in this case the syzygy cycle appears to have length 2 the betti tables are below e 1 0 1 2 3 4 total 1 3 4 4 4 0 1 6 3 9 1 10 3 11 3 12 1 1 13 3 e 2 0 1 2 3 4 total 1 3 4 4 4 0 1 48 3 72 3 1 75 1 3 3 78 1 6 2 example this example shows how the relatively compressed and the diagonal hypersurface cases can differ even for the same values of p and d here p d 4 first we show that in the diagonal case the link jq is not relatively compressed by examining the generator degrees and then we provide the resulting betti tables for the resolutions of r m q over r recall that in the relatively compressed case the ideal jq is generated in degrees s 2 and s 2 1 in contrast the data in the diagonal case is as follows all computations performed in macaulay 2 gs for p 5 and p 7 in case of the diagonal hypersurface x 4 y 4 z 4 the ideal jq is not relatively compressed which we can see as follows from the degrees of generators of jq for p 5 the ideal x 5 y 5 z 5 x 4 y 4 z 4 has 1 generator in degree 3 and 6 generators in degree 6 in the relatively compressed case it would have generators only in degree 5 which is equal to both pe and s 2 1 the ideal x 25 y 25 z 25 x 4 y 4 z 4 has generators in degrees 25 31 and 36 rather than in degrees 25 pe and 35 s 2 1 as in the relatively compressed case the case of p 7 is similar the ideal x 7 y 7 z 7 x 4 y 4 z 4 has six generators of degree 7 and one of degree 9 in the relatively compressed case there are generators of degrees 7 pe and 8 s 2 1 the ideal x 49 y 49 z 49 x 4 y 4 z 4 has generators of degrees 49 70 and 72 rather than pe 49 and s 2 1 71 as in the relatively compressed case we can see the impact of these differences in the betti tables for the resolutions of r m q over r which we display side by side below the tables below are for the polynomial listed that appears to be general enough to give a relatively com pressed link jq and the polynomial x 4 y 4 z 4 which behaves differently as in example 6 1 the rows that are skipped are zero row numbers are indicated at the left and after column 4 the pattern repeats first take p 7 for e 1 we have betti numbers 39 f xy 3 yz 3 zx 3 0 1 2 3 4 total 1 3 8 8 8 0 1 6 3 10 8 8 12 8 f x 4 y 4 z 4 0 1 2 3 4 total 1 3 4 4 4 0 1 6 3 9 3 1 11 1 3 3 13 1 and for e 2 we have f xy 3 yz 3 zx 3 0 1 2 3 4 total 1 3 8 8 8 0 1 48 3 73 8 8 75 8 f x 4 y 4 z 4 0 1 2 3 4 total 1 3 4 4 4 0 1 48 3 72 3 1 74 1 3 3 76 1 next we give an example for which the contrast is more extreme for e 2 take p 5 indeed as established in krv 12 for the polynomial x 4 y 4 z 4 the module r m q has finite projective dimension over r compare this to the hypersurface given by the polynomial f x 3 y xy 3 x 3 z xz 3 yz 3 for which the ideal x 25 y 25 z 25 f has three generators of degree 25 and 8 of degree 35 so it is relatively compressed for e 1 we have f x 3 y xy 3 x 3 z xz 3 yz 3 0 1 2 3 4 total 1 3 4 4 4 0 1 4 3 7 8 8 9 8 f x 4 y 4 z 4 0 1 2 3 4 total 1 3 4 4 4 0 1 4 3 5 1 7 3 3 1 9 1 3 and for e 2 we have f x 3 y xy 3 x 3 z xz 3 yz 3 0 1 2 3 4 total 1 3 4 4 4 0 1 24 3 37 8 8 39 8 f x 4 y 4 z 4 0 1 2 3 4 total 1 3 2 0 0 0 1 24 3 33 1 38 1 for e 2 for the diagonal hypersurface r m q even has finite projective dimension over r in contrast the other polynomial is general enough that the resolution exhibits the behavior described in theorem a of the introduction that is one of 40 c miller h rahmati and r r g the
