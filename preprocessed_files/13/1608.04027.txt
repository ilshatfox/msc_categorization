field k of charactersitic zero and d a k derivation of r consider the isotropy group if d aut r d autk r d 1 d in his doctoral thesis 1 baltazar proved that if d is a simple shamsuddin derivation of k x 1 x 2 then its isotropy group is trivial he also gave an example of a non simple derivation whose isotropy group is infinite recently mendes and pan 12 generalized this result to an arbitrary derivation of k x 1 x 2 proving that a derivation of k x 1 x 2 is simple if and only if its isotropy group is trivial in this paper we prove that the isotropy group of a simple shamsuddin derivation of the polynomial ring r k x 1 xn is trivial we also calculate other isotropy groups of not necessarily simple derivations of k x 1 x 2 and prove that they are finite cyclic groups 1 introduction throughout this paper k is a field of characteristic zero let d be a derivation of a commutative k algebra r we say that d is a simple derivation of r or just that r is d simple if r does not have any proper non zero ideal i such that d i i such an ideal i is called a d invariant ideal a d stable ideal or simply a d ideal research on simple derivations of commutative k algebras has increased signifi cantly in the past years this was motivated on one hand by the connection with the theory of noncommutative noetherian simple rings in fact if r x d is the ore extension of r by d then r x d is a simple ring in the sense that it has no non trivial two sided ideals if and only if r is d simple see 8 in this case if r is a noetherian k algebra then so is r x d by hilbert basis theorem and r x d provides a useful example for testing conjectures in the still mysterious theory of noncommutative noetherian simple rings on the other hand there have been many recent connections of d simplicity with commutative algebra and algebraic geometry via the theory of holomorphic foliations see for example 5 7 and 16 d modules see for example 4 and 6 and also with the question of algebraic independence of solutions of certain differential equations in the power series ring k t see 3 we should mention at least two important results in commutative algebra that involve d simple rings a seidenberg showed in 15 that if a finitely generated domain r admits a simple derivation d then r is regular r hart showed in 9 that if r is a localization of a finitely generated domain then r is regular if and only if r admits a simple derivation d despite their ubiquity simple derivations are far from being well understood and even a characterization of simple derivations of the polynomial ring k x 1 xn cannot be foreseen up to now the only known and trivial case is when n 1 nev ertheless there is a class of polynomial derivations the shamsuddin derivations whose simplicity we now understand better a shamsuddin derivation is a deriva tion d of the polynomial ring k x y 1 yn of the type d x n i 1 aiyi bi yi with ai bi k x for every i 1 n owing to a seminal paper of 1 http arxiv org abs 1608 04027 v 1 2 l n bertoncello and d levcovitz y lequain 10 we can decide effectively if a shamsuddin derivation is simple or not in terms of the polynomials ai and bi we will recall lequain s result in the next paragraph observe that simplicity is preserved by the action of the group of automorphisms of r over the module of derivations of r by conjugation more precisely if r is a k algebra its k automorphism group autk r acts by conjugation over the module of k derivations of r derk r given d derk r and autk r then d 1 derk r moreover d is simple if and only if d 1 is simple in order to understand this action better we focus on the stabilizer subgroup of the action the isotropy group of a derivation d is its stabilizer subgroup aut r d autk r d 1 d this group behaves well with respect to the conjugation action if d d 1 then aut r d aut r d 1 the isotropy groups are conjugated in his doctoral thesis baltazar see 1 investigated the isotropy group of a simple shamsuddin derivation of a polynomial ring in two variables k x y he showed that this group is trivial he also calculated the isotropy group of the non simple derivation x of k x y y is a d ideal and obtained the infinite group aut k x y x x y 7 x p y ay b p y k y a k b k baltazar thesis advisor was i pan based on this result of his thesis and on this example they conjectured baltazar pan conjecture let d be a simple derivation of a finitely generated k algebra r then its isotropy group is finite as far as we know the status of this conjecture up to now is the following as we mentioned baltazar proved it for shamsuddin derivations in two variables in his doctoral thesis 1 recently mendes and pan proved the conjecture in dimension two 12 the main purpose of this paper is to prove the baltazar pan conjecture for an arbitrary simple shamsuddin derivation of a polynomial ring k x 1 xn in fact we show that for this class of derivations the isotropy group is trivial see theorem 3 2 to do so we strongly use the characterization of simple shamsuddin derivations given by lequain in 10 this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we recall the main results of 10 that will be used to prove our results we also use this section to establish the basic notations of the paper in section 3 we prove the main theorem on the isotropy group of a simple shamsuddin derivation theorem 3 2 in section 4 we study the isotropy group of certain derivations of the polynomial ring in two variables k x y that may not be simple we prove that their isotropy group are finite but not necessarily trivial in section 5 we consider derivations that are simple but not shamsuddin we claim without proving it that their isotropy group are trivial as well finally in section 6 based on all previous results and examples we formulate another conjecture on the isotropy group of a simple derivation of a polynomial ring 2 simple shamsuddin derivations lequain s characterization recall that throughout this paper k is a field of characteristic zero given integers s r 1 rs 1 we consider x yi j i 1 s j 1 ri a set of indeterminates over k we denote the derivation yi j of the polynomial ring k x yi j i 1 s j 1 ri simply by i j for an element f k x we will often use f instead of x f on the isotropy group of a simple derivation 3 remember that a derivation of the polynomial ring k x y 1 yn of the type d x n i 1 aiyi bi yi with ai bi k x for every i 1 n was defined to be a shamsuddin derivation grouping the terms that have the same ai we can rewrite d in the following form d x s i 1 ri j 1 aiyi j bi j i j with ai bi j k x and ai 6 ak if i 6 k this specific form of the derivation d is called the canonical form of d the restriction d k x yi 1 yi ri that is the deriva tion di x ri j 1 aiyi j bi j i j of the polynomial ring k x yi 1 yi ri is called the i th canonical component of d although we will not need it explicitly it would be important to begin announcing the following simple and beautiful result from shamsuddin theorem 2 1 shamsuddin 17 let r be a ring y an indeterminate over r and d a derivation of r y such that d r r r is d simple d y ay b with a b r then the following statements are equivalent i r y is d simple ii the equation d z az b does not have any solution in r we will now recall the main results of 10 they will be used abundantly in the next section theorem 2 2 10 theorem 3 1 local global principle the following properties are equivalent i d is a simple derivation of k x yi j i 1 s j 1 ri ii for every i 1 s di x ri j 1 aiyi j bi j i j is a simple deriva tion of k x yi 1 yi ri for this result to be useful we need a criteria to decide if the i th component of d that is di is simple or not this is given to us by 10 theorem 3 2 to enunciate it we need a lemma and a definition lemma 2 3 10 lemma 2 3 let a b k x a 6 0 consider the following sequences of equalities b a q 1 r 1 q 1 a q 2 r 2 q t a 0 rt 1 where q 1 qt r 1 rt 1 k x and deg ri deg a for every i a the following statements are equivalent i the equation z az b has a solution in k x ii t 1 i 1 ri 0 b if the equation z az b has a solution f k x then f t i 1 qi definition 2 4 10 definition 2 4 let a b k x a 6 0 be two polynomials and r 1 rt 1 the sequence of polynomials defined in the previous lemma the polynomial t 1 i 1 ri will be denoted by p a b observation 2 5 note that in the definition above if a k then p a b 0 theorem 2 6 10 theorem 3 2 let i 1 s a the following properties are equivalent i di is a simple derivation of k x yi 1 yi ri 4 l n bertoncello and d levcovitz ii ai 6 0 and the polynomials p ai bi 1 p ai bi ri are k linear independent iii for every k 1 kri k ri 0 0 the equation z aiz ri j 1 kjbi j does not have any solution in k x b we can always determine effectively whether property ii is satisfied or not 3 the isotropy group of simple shamsuddin derivations recall the following notation for the isotropy group of d aut k x y 1 yn d aut k x y 1 yn d 1 id proposition 3 1 let d x n j 1 aiyi bi i be a simple shamsuddin derivation of the polynomial ring k x y 1 yn if aut k x y 1 yn d then x x for some k proof let us first show that x depends only on x write x cty t i c 1 yi c 0 for some t n ck k x y 1 yi 1 yi 1 yn ct 6 0 since 1 d x d x then 1 d x d cty t i c 1 yi c 0 d ct taict y t i terms of lower degree in yi if t 1 then d ct taict 0 that is ct is a d ideal but this implies that ct 0 because as d is simple ai 6 0 therefore t 0 and x does not depend on yi for every i then x k x but then 1 d x d x x thus x x for some k let us write the polynomial ring k x y 1 yn as k x y 1 ys where yi yi 1 yi ri accordingly the shamsuddin derivation d has a canonical form x s i 1 ri j 1 aiyi j bi j i j where ai bi j k x and for every i 6 k ai 6 ak to simplify even further the notation we denote the polynomial ring k x y 1 ys simply by k x yi j recall that each derivation di x ri j 1 aiyi j bi j i j of the polynomial ring k x yi 1 yi ri is called the i th canonical component of d theorem 3 2 if d is a simple shamsuddin derivation of the polynomial ring k x y 1 yn n 1 then its isotropy group is trivial proof let y and w be any of the variables yi j for i 1 s and j 1 ri including the case w y we want to analyze the degw y to simplify the notation we put d y ay b d w a w b with a b a b k x we write y cnw n cn 1 w n 1 c 0 with ck k x yi j w cn 6 0 so n degw y from d y d y we get a y b d cnw n cn 1 w n 1 c 0 let us suppose that n 1 and look for a contradiction if y 6 w comparing the coefficients of wn above and taking into account that by proposition 3 1 a b k x and that d ck k x yi j w since d is a shamsuddin derivation we have that a cn d cn na cn d cn a na cn as d is simple cn k and a na changing the role of the variables y and w we also have that a ma if m degy w 1 then by proposition on the isotropy group of a simple derivation 5 3 1 a x a ma m 1 a m 1 na mna x since a 6 0 m n 1 then a x a x as deg a 1 by observation 2 5 and theorem 2 6 a ii 0 but now a a a note that we just proved three things x x y and w belong to the same component of d since a a and degw y degy w 1 let us suppose without loss of generality that y and w belong to the first component say y w y 1 1 y 1 r 1 to simplify the notation we put y 1 y 1 1 yr y 1 r 1 and d yi ay 1 bi a bi k x then by the previous argument y 1 c 1 y 1 cryr c 0 with c 1 cr k and c 0 k x if we impose the condition d y 1 d y 1 again we have c 1 d y 1 cr yr c 0 a c 1 y 1 cryr c 0 b substituting d yi ayi bi and canceling aciyi on both sides we get 3 3 c 0 ac 0 c 1 1 b 1 crbr if r 2 this contradicts theorem 2 6 a iii since cr 6 0 therefore degyj y 1 0 if j 2 r that means that y 1 does not depend on any of the variables y 2 yr besides y 1 c 1 y 1 c 0 c 1 k and c 0 k x but now equation 3 3 reads c 0 ac 0 c 1 1 b 1 by theorem 2 6 a iii again c 1 1 and then c 0 0 since a 6 0 thus y 1 y 1 as we already proved that x x we have that id 4 quadratic and cubic derivations in this section we study the isotropy group of some derivations in two variables that are not shamsuddin derivations note that in general we will not suppose that the derivation is simple definition 4 1 let k x y be the polynomial ring in two variables over a field k of characteristic zero a derivation d of k x y has y degree n if d x 1 and d y has degree n as a polynomial in y with coefficients in k x therefore a derivation in two variables of y degree n has the following form d x h 0 h 1 y hny n y with hi k x hn 6 0 a derivations of y degree 2 respectively 3 is called a quadratic derivation in two variables respectively a cubic derivation in two variables remark our quadratic derivations differ a little and are more general from those studied by maciejewski moulin ollagnier and nowicki in 11 in their case d y y 2 a x y b x is a monic polynomial in y they studied the simplicity of these derivations nowicki also proved that there are simple derivations in two variables with an arbitrarily large y degree see 13 theorem 4 2 let d be a derivation of the polynomial ring in two variables k x y of y degree n 2 let aut k x y d then i x x and y b 0 b 1 y with b 0 k x b 1 k and b 1 satisfies b n 1 1 1 ii if b 1 1 then b 0 0 in this case id 6 l n bertoncello and d levcovitz iii let d y h x y h 0 h 1 y hny n with hi k x hn 6 0 if h 0 6 0 and b 0 0 then b 1 1 in this case id iv if d is simple and b 0 0 then b 1 1 in this case id proof i let us write x a 0 a 1 y asy s with ai k x as 6 0 we will show first that s 0 since d x 1 and d x d x we have 1 d a 0 a 1 y asy s a 0 a 1 y a sy s a 1 d y sasy s 1 d y substituting d y for h 0 hny n and collecting the coefficient of y n s 1 on both sides of the above equation we get sashn 0 since n s 1 s 1 1 as ashn 6 0 then s 0 therefore x k x imposing the condition d x d x again we have 1 x then x x for some k let us write now y b 0 b 1 y bty t with bi k x bt 6 0 then bi x bi x thus d y h 0 x h 1 x b 0 bty t hn x b 0 bty t n on the other hand d y b 0 b 1 y b ty t b 1 d y tbty t 1 d y since d y d y substituting d y for h 0 hny n and comparing the terms of higher degree in y we get hn x b n t y nt tbthn x y n t 1 then t 1 bn 1 t 1 and 0 therefore x x and y b 0 b 1 y with b 0 k x b 1 k and b 1 satisfies b n 1 1 1 ii we impose again the condition d y d y but now by i and the hypothesis y b 0 y looking at the coefficient of degree n 1 in y we have nhnb 0 0 this implies that b 0 0 since nhn 6 0 then id iii now we look at the constant term in d y d y we have 4 3 hnb n 0 hn 1 b n 1 0 h 1 b 0 h 0 1 b 1 b 0 if h 0 6 0 and b 0 0 then b 1 1 and id iv if d is simple then h 0 6 0 otherwise y would be a d ideal now it follows from iii above corollary 4 4 let d be a derivation in two variables of y degree n 2 let n 1 k denote the cyclic group of n 1 roots of unity in k then the isotropy group of d is a subgroup of n 1 k in particular it is a finite cyclic group proof consider the map k x y d n 1 k given by b 1 where y b 0 b 1 y it is a group homomorphisms by theorem 4 2 i it is well defined by ii it is injective then the result follows corollary 4 5 let d be a derivation in two variables of y degree n 2 over a field k suppose that k r then the isotropy group of d is either trivial or cyclic with two elements proof since k r the only possible roots of units in k are 1 an interesting consequence of corollary 4 4 is that a quadratic derivation has a trivial isotropy group regardless of whether it is simple or not but cubic deriva tions can have an isotropy group of order 2 on the isotropy group of a simple derivation 7 corollary 4 6 i if d is a quadratic derivation in two variables then its isotropy group is trivial ii if d be a cubic derivation in two variables then its isotropy group is either trivial or a group of order 2 and both cases occur proof it follows immediately from corollary 4 4 example 4 7 let d be the cubic derivation in two variables given by d x 1 d y h 1 h 3 y 3 h 1 h 3 k x h 3 6 0 let be the isomorphisms of k x y given by x x y y then k x y d id it is therefore a cyclic group of order 2 example 4 8 let d be the derivation in two variables given by d x 1 d y y n px where n 2 p k nowicki proved in 13 that d is simple we claim that its isotropy group is trivial in fact let k x y d by theorem 4 2 y b 0 b 1 y b 0 k x b 1 k by equation 4 3 we have bn 0 px 1 b 1 b 0 since n 2 b 0 k then p 1 b 1 x b n 0 0 then b 1 1 b 0 0 and therefore id 5 examples in this section we give three more examples the first is of a non simple shamsuddin derivation with an infinite isotropy group actually baltazar in his thesis 1 had already given such an example the difference here is that our example is a shamsuddin derivation in three variables while his example is not a shamsuddin derivation and it is in two variables example 5 1 let d be the derivation of the polynomial ring k x y z given by d x 1 d y 1 xy and d z 1 xz this is a non simple shamsuddin derivation of k x y z since the ideal y z is a d ideal its isotropy group is given by aut k x y z such that x x y ay bz z cy dz with a b 1 c d 1 and ad bc 6 0 therefore it is an infinite group we now give two examples of simple derivations of polynomial rings that are not shamsuddin derivations but still have a trivial isotropy group since the techniques of proofs are very similar to the ones we have been given before we will omit them example 5 2 consider the derivation of the polynomial ring k x y z given by d x xy 1 y y z 1 z nowicki proved in 14 example 13 4 3 that this derivation is simple its isotropy group is trivial note that d is not a shamsuddin derivation example 5 3 consider the derivation of the polynomial ring in n variables k x 1 x 2 xn given by d x 1 1 d xi aixi bi where ai bi k x 1 xi 1 bi 6 0 degxi 1 ai 1 and degxi 1 bi degxi 1 ai nowicki proved in 14 example 13 4 2 that this derivation is simple its isotropy group is trivial note that d is not a shamsuddin derivation 6 a new conjecture on the isotropy group of a simple derivation based on baltazar 1 2 and mendes pan results 12 and also on the results and examples we presented in this paper we can make the following conjecture conjecture let d be a derivation of the polynomial ring k x 1 x 2 xn in n variables over a field k of characteristic zero then d is simple if and only if its isotropy group is trivial 8 l n
