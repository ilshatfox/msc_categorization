characterization of r modules m whose local cohomol ogy is finite length up to some index in terms of asymptotic vanishing of koszul cohomology on parameter ideals up to the same index in particular we show that a quasi unmixed module m is asymptotically cohen macaulay if and only if m is cohen macaulay on the punctured spectrum if and only if sup h i f 1 fd m f 1 fd m i d for d dim m dim r 2 introduction throughout this paper all rings are assumed to be commutative rings with unity and all modules are assumed to be unital we will use r m to denote a local ring by which we mean a noetherian ring with unique maximal ideal m and residue field the goal of this paper is to give precise conditions under which lengths of koszul cohomology of a finitely generated r module m on all systems of parameters on m are bounded these conditions will be whether or not certain local cohomology of m on the maximal ideal have finite length looking to bound lengths of koszul cohomology on systems of parameters in this way is natural in light of theorems of lech s described below together with their recent strengthings and also timely in light of work on similar asymptotics also described below recently there has been a great deal of interest in the asymptotics of koszul cohomology bhatt hochster and ma have recently shown that several results including positivity of serre intersection multiplicities that would follow from the existence of small cohen macaulay modules over complete local domains would also follow from the existence of lim cohen macaulay sequences of modules i e sequences of modules whose koszul cohomology on a fixed system of parameters is eventually small enough in a sense we will not make precise here 1 5 in this vein one may wonder if there are other environments in which koszul cohomology vanishing may be replaced as a condition by koszul cohomology being asymptotically small some theorems of lech s together with more recent work in their wake point to koszul cohomology we would reasonably expect to be asymptotically small in this way lech s inequality states that for any local ring r m of dimension d and any m primary ideal i ei r r i d em r 8 theorem 3 lech s inequality is an invaluable tool in many areas of commutative algebra such as in the study of the minimal number of generators of ideals 2 of first hilbert coefficients 10 and of reduction numbers 13 there has additionally been recent work to improve lech s inequality most notably in 4 and 6 most recently lech s inequality was generalized to the case of finitely generated modules in 7 in the same paper it is shown that there also exists a nonzero lower bound depending only on m for the ratio ei m m im for all m primary ideals i whenever m is a finitely generated quasi unmixed r module which is to say 1 http arxiv org abs 1810 01359 v 2 2 patricia klein that the stu ckrad vogel conjecture is settled in the affirmative furthermore the authors show that hi xt 1 xt d m m xt 1 xt d m converges to 0 uniformly over all systems of parameters x 1 xd for every 0 i dim m whenever m is quasi unmixed where h i x 1 xd m denotes the ith koszul cohomology module of the elements x 1 xd on the module m returning to classical work due to lech the lech s limit formula 8 theorem 2 generalized can be generalized to modules see 9 states that lim mini ni e x n 1 1 x nd d m m x n 1 1 x nd d m 1 in light of these formulas a natural question is whether lech s limit formula holds when the sequence of parameter ideals given by powers of a fixed system of parameters is replaced by any sequence of parameter ideals in increasingly high powers of the maximal ideal example 4 6 demonstrates that it does not in general moreover theorem 4 5 gives precise conditions on when lim n h i x 1 n xdn m r in 0 for all sequences of parameter ideals x 1 n xdn in mn and all i dim m dim r if assh m assh r these same conditions also give lim n h i x 1 n xdn m m inm 0 for all sequences of parameter ideals x 1 n xdn in mn and all i dim m which directly implies that lim n ein m m inm 1 by serre s formula 11 which states that 2 1 ei r d i 0 1 i hd i x 1 xd r for our convenience in studying these asymptotics we make two definitions definition 2 1 we say thatm is i effaceable if for every sequence of parameter ideals x 1 n xdn in mn we have lim n h i x 1 n xdn m r inr 0 define assh m p ass m dim r p dim m if assh m assh r we may replace r inr by m inm in the definition above 7 lemma 4 4 definition 2 2 the asymptotic depth of m denoted asydepth m is k if m is i effaceable for all i k and m is not k effaceable we say that m is asymptotically cohen macaulay if asydepth m dimm we are now prepared to state the main theorem of this paper theorem 2 3 if m is a finitely generated module over the local ring r m of with dim m dim r d then the following three conditions are equivalent for each 0 k d 1 asydepth m k 2 sup h i x 1 xd m f 1 fd m i k 3 h im m for all i k we will give two proofs of theorem 2 3 one as theorem 4 5 in section 4 and one as corollary 5 7 in section 5 recall that whenever m is quasi unmixed i e if m is an equidimensional r module condition 3 is equivalent to depthp mp height p k d for all prime ideals p 6 m note that when k d this is saying that m is cohen macaulay on the punctured spectrum it is surprising that requiring that certain koszul cohomology modules grow slowly as in the definition finite length local cohomology and bounds on koszul cohomology 3 of aymptotic depth actually forces the lengths of all koszul cohomology modules on all systems of parameters to share a global bound that is to say that condition 2 which requires an absolute bound on the lengths of koszul homology modules is prima facie much stronger than condition 1 which merely requires that these lengths grow somewhat slowly one key ingredient in the major proofs of this paper is the result that one can find prime ideals p and sequences of parameter ideals in such that r in and r in p have approximately the same length even when dim r p 1 the precise statements of these surprising results together with their proofs which are computational in nature can be found in section 6 we give one example of such a sequence of parameter ideals here example 2 4 let r x y z where k is any field let p x y and let in z n 4 znxn yn znx xn 1 xzn 4 n yzn then r in x y n 4 while n 4 r in n 4 2 n 2 n 1 2 3 n and so lim n r in r in p 1 details of the computation appear in section 6 as part of proposition 6 1 we will use such parameter ideals together with one key spectral sequence argument to give a proof of the main result in section 5 we will give an alternative proof that m asymptotically cohen macaulay implies m cohen macaulay on the punctured spectrum this alternative proof shows directly that m asymptotically cohen macaulay implies m h 0 m m torsion free lemma 5 2 and that the quotient of an asymptotically cohen macaualy module by a non zerodivisor is asymptotically cohen macaulay lemma 5 3 which gives intuition for asymptotic depth behaving as a depth theory this approach also allows us to give a rigidity result on asymptotic depth corollary 5 6 this argument gives more information than the section 4 argument on where meaning in which cohomology module the obstruction to asymptotic cohen macaulayness can be found in corollary 5 7 we see how the equivalence of asymptotically cohen macaulay with cohen macaulay on the punctured spectrum and quasi unmixed together with the torsion free result implies directly the entirety of the main result it is worth noting that the quasi unmixed assumption is genuinely necessary for m cohen macaulay on the punctured spectrum to imply asymptotically cohen macaulay theorem 5 8 the example below gives intuition for that result roughly speaking what goes wrong in the example below is that the ratio of the length of the first koszul cohomology module to the length of r in cannot be bounded away from 1 if it could be given that r is not quasi unmixed we would have a counterexample to 12 theorem 1 example 2 5 r x y z xz yz let in x n zn 3 yn then ein r e xn yn r z n 2 while r in x y z yn xn zn 3 xz yz n 3 n n 1 where the n 3 counts monomials with a positive power of z whose image is nonzero in r in noting that z n 3 1 z xn 0 r in and n n 1 counts monomials yixj with 0 i n and 0 j n 1 whose images are nonzero in r in noting that xn 1 xzn 3 0 r in using serre s formula n 2 ein r r in h 1 xn zn 3 yn r n 3 n n 1 h 1 xn zn 3 yn r and so h 1 xn zn 3

during her doctoral work of which this paper is part the author has been partially supported by nsf grants dms 1401384 and 0943832 3 statements of results from section 6 and some simplifications we summarize below in one statement the results whose proofs appear in section 6 we will need only theorem 3 1 in section 4 to show the main result theorem 3 1 if r x 1 xd or r v x 1 x 2 xd 1 or r v x 1 x 2 xd p sx 1 with s 1 d 2 and v v pv a discrete valuation ring then neither r x 1 xk nor r p x 1 xk nor r p x 2 xk with 1 k d 1 are d effaceable this result is proved as propositions 6 9 and 6 10 in section 6 we will need the full strength of theorem 3 2 in addition to theorem 3 1 in section 5 to show that m asymptotically cohen macaulay implies m h 0 m m torsion free theorem 3 2 let d 3 k 1 s 1 d 2 h 1 a field and v v pv a discrete valuation ring if r x 1 xd then m x 1 xd h r is not h 1 effaceable if r v x 1 x 2 xd 1 then neither m p k x 1 xd h 1 r nor m x 1 xd h r is h 1 effaceable if r v x 1 x 2 xd p sx 1 then none of m p k x 1 xd h r nor m pk x 2 xd h 1 r nor m x 1 xd h 1 r is h 1 effaceable in all cases above and also when h d 1 n r m is not h effaceable theorem 3 2 combines the results of theorem 6 5 corollary 6 6 corollary 6 8 proposition 6 9 and proposition 6 10 definition 3 3 if m is a finitely generated module over the local ring r m let h i i m denote any one of the ith koszul cohomology modules of f 1 fr on the module m when f 1 fr minimally generate i recall that if f 1 fr and g 1 gr both minimally generate i then h i f 1 fr m h i g 1 gr m for all i z we will only use this notation when we are interested in the module h i f 1 fr m up to isomorphism for example when we are interested in its length as we will frequently be we now make a reduction relevant to both section 4 and section 5 we will reduce to the complete case denote by r the m adic completion of the local ring r m and by m the m adic completion of the r module m using the fact we recalled just above it is sufficient to show that expansion and contraction give a bijection between ideals of r generated by parameters on m and those of r generated by parameters on m lemma 3 4 let m be a d dimensional module over the local ring r m then expansion and contraction give a bijection between ideals of r generated by parameters on m and ideals of r generated by parameters on m proof by replacing r by r ann m we may assume that m is faithful and that dim r d let x 1 xd be parameters on m and denote by x 1 x d their images in r r m because m x 1 xd m m x 1 x d m it is immediate that x 1 x d are parameters on m suppose that y y d r are parameters on m and let i y 1 y d choose n 0 so that m n m i we claim that for any i m n for 1 i d i y 1 1 y d d the containment y 1 1 y d d i is clear because each y i i and each i m n m i i finite length local cohomology and bounds on koszul cohomology 5 the other containment follows from nakayama s lemma together with the fact that images of the y i i generate i m i because the i m i and the y i generate i now choose the i so that each y i i is the image of some yi r and set i y 1 yd because i mi i m i we have as the notation suggests i ir and using the well known bijection between m primary ideals of r and of m primary ideals of r i i r 4 the spectral sequence argument in all characteristics the purpose of this section is to prove theorem 2 3 let denote the matlis dual lemma 4 1 let r m be a complete local ring and let m be a finitely generated r module of dimension d then for each 0 i d and every ideal i f 1 fd of r generated by parameters on m h i f 1 fd m i j 0 hd i j f 1 fd h j m m proof the argument is similar to theorem 3 16 in 3 and an explanation of how this result follows directly from the that result can be found in 7 we consider the spectral sequence of the double complex coming from applying hom a where a is the dualizing complex of r with the homological koszul complex of f 1 fd on m the inequality in the statement of the theorem can be read off from the e 2 page theorem 4 2 let r m be a local ring let m be a finitely generated r module of dimension d and fix 0 k d if hjm m for all j k then sup h i f 1 fd m f 1 fd parameters on m 0 i k moreover if r is complete then for each 0 i k sup h i f 1 fd m f 1 fd parameters on m i j 0 d i j hjm m proof using lemma 3 4 we may assume that r and m are complete therefore it suffices to show only the last statement of the theorem which follows from lemma 4 1 more precisely by examining the koszul cohomology modules hd i j f 1 fd h j m m on the right hand side of the inequality in lemma 4 1 using the facts that each h j m m for 0 j d 1 and that f 1 fd m we see that for each parameter ideal i f 1 fd and each 0 i d h i f 1 fd m i j 0 d i j hjm m we now aim to prove that asymptotically small koszul cohomology implies finite length local cohomology we begin by reducing to the case of a ring that is either regular or gorenstein of a certain form lemma 4 3 suppose that for all finitely generated modules m over a complete local ring s n with dim m dim s where s is either regular or gorenstein of the form v x 1 xd psx 1 where p generates the maximal ideal of the complete discrete valuation ring v and s 1 if asydepth m k then h im m for all i k then the same holds over any local ring r m 6 patricia klein proof using lemma 3 4 we may assume that r and m are complete suppose asydepth m k over the complete local ring r by cohen s structure theorem r is a module finite extension of a ring s n that is either regular or of the form s v x 1 xd psx 1 where p generates the maximal ideal of the complete discrete valuation ring v and s 1 every parameter ideal in of s is a parameter ideal of r every finitely generated r module is also a finitely generated s module and h ir in m h i s in m for all i z because r inr s r s in for each n 1 where s r denotes the minimal number of generators of r as an s module we have h i in m s in s r h i in m r inr n 0 for all i k which is to say that asydepth m k over s by assumption then h in m for all i k but h in m h im m for all 0 i d and so h im m for all i k theorem 4 4 let r m be a complete d dimensional ring with that is either regular or goren stein of the form v x 1 xd psx 1 where v is a complete discrete valuation ring with maximal ideal p and s 1 let m be a finitely generated r module then for all 0 k d asydepth m k implies h im m for all i k proof suppose that asydepth m k but that h im m for some 0 k d and as sume that k is minimal with respect to this property notice that for each parameter ideal i h i 1 i syz 1 m h i i m and h i 1 syz 1 m h im m for each 0 i d 1 and so by replacing m by syzd k 1 m we have a counterexample when k d 1 and h im m for all 0 i d 1 we now return to the spectral sequence from lemma 4 1 in order to improve the inequality below is the possibly nonzero component of the e 2 page of the spectral sequence run by taking homology of columns first we omit maps which will not be of interest to us h 0 i hdn m h 0 i hd 1 n m h 0 i h 0 n m h 1 i hdn m h 1 i hd 1 n m h 1 i h 0 n m h i i hdn m h i i hd 1 n m hi i hi 1 n m h i i h 0 n m hd i hdn m hd i hd 1 n m hd i h 0 n m we may from here improve the result of lemma 4 1 in the case of i d 1 note that hd 1 i m is computed as the sum of the lengths of modules on the e page currently occupied in the grid above by the modules hj i h j 1 m m for 0 j d the appropriate diagonal is shown finite length local cohomology and bounds on koszul cohomology 7 in bold above for j d we already have h j 1 m m it follows that hd i hd 1 m m only maps to and from modules of finite length on pages ei for i 2 therefore controlling the lengths of the hd 1 i m is the same task as controlling the lengths of the hd i hd 1 m m more precisely the task remaining to us is to show that if dim hd 1 m m 0 then there exists a sequence of parameter ideals in such that hd 1 m m inh d 1 m m r in 6 0 as in if dim hd 1 m m 0 then there is a map hd 1 m m r p for some prime ideal p with dim r p 0 it is therefore sufficient to find a sequence of parameter ideals in such that r p in r in 6 0 as in for every prime ideal p with dim r p 0 we now seek to reduce to the special cases of the above limits studied in section 6 suppose that p is height h choose y 1 yh r such that y 11 yh 1 form a system of parameters in rp and using prime avoidance extend to a system of parameters y 1 yd in r in the mixed characteristic case in which p is a parameter in r choose y 1 p if p p or yd p if p p when extending to a full system of parameters choose yd before choosing yj for h j d form the ring s y 1 yd in the equal characteristic case s v y 2 yd in the mixed characteristic case with p p and p a parameter and s v y 1 yd 1 if p p and p a parameter if p is not a parameter in r and x 1 p p take y 1 x 1 p and form s v x 1 y 2 yd psx 1 if x 1 p 6 p take yd x 1 p and form s v x 1 y 1 y 2 yd 1 psx 1 again choose yd before the yj for h j d when necessary in all cases we have the short exact sequence 0 s r c 0 with c now for any parameter ideal i of s we have from the long exact sequence of koszul homology 0 hd 1 i c s i r ir c ic 0 note that hd 1 i c d 2 c and c ic c independent of i it follows that lim in r inr s in 1 for every sequence of parameter ideals in mn now if s is regular set q y 1 yh s in the gorenstein case set q p y 1 yh or q p x 1 y 1 yh or q x 1 y 1 yh depending on whether p p but x 1 p p p and x 1 p or p p but x 1 p respectively using the short exact sequence 0 s q r p c 0 where c is a quotient of c completing the short exact sequence and the argument from the proceeding paragraph we have lim in r in p r s in q 1 for every sequence of parameter ideals in mn we may therefore assume that r is either regular or gorenstein of the form described the result now follows from propositions 6 9 and 6 10 we are now prepared to prove the desired theorem theorem 4 5 if m is a finitely generated module over the local ring r m of with dim m dim r d then the following three conditions are equivalent for each 0 k d 1 asydepth m k 2 sup h i f 1 fd m f 1 fd m i k 3 h im m for all i k proof it is obvious that 2 implies 1 using lemma 3 4 we may assume that r and m are complete using lemma 4 3 we may assume that r is a complete ring with that is either regular or 8 patricia klein gorenstein of the form v x 1 xd psx 1 where v is a complete discrete valuation ring with maximal ideal p and s 1 the result now follows from theorem 4 2 and theorem 4 4 example 4 6 we now give an application of theorem 4 5 in particular we give an example of a local ring r m showing that r in ein r need not approach 1 as n for every sequence of parameter ideals in mn this example shows that lech s limit formula does not generalize to the case of all parameter ideals in increasingly high powers of the maximal ideal let r m be the localization of x y z x 3 y 3 z 3 s u v w at the homogeneous maximal ideal where is a field and s denotes segre product because r is normal it is in particular s 2 and so its only nonvanishing koszul cohomology modules are i 3 4 it is not cohen macaulay on the punctured spectrum and so h im r for some i d and so r is not asymptotically cohen macaulay by theorem 4 5 therefore we may pick a sequence of parameter ideals in such that h 3 in r r in 6 0 it follows that for that sequence ein r r in h 4 in r h 3 in r h 4 in r 6 1 because we do an explicit computation of the only non zero homology modules below we do not exactly think of this example as an application of the theorem but the computation is certainly part of our understanding of the theorem and it is a particularly interesting example of the computation of the ratio ein m m inm example 4 7 let r x y z andm x y r note that depthm m 2 and soh i i m 0 for i 0 1 for every parameter ideal i because m is generated by 2 elements m im 2 r i for every m primary ideal i let in zn 4 znxn yn znx xn 1 xzn 4 n yzn as in proposition 6 1 using the computation in proposition 6 1 we compute 0 lim n ein m m inm lim n m inm h 2 in m m inm 1 lim n h 2 in m m inm 1 lim n h 2 in m 2 r in 1 lim n n 4 2 n 4 2 n 2 n 1 2 3 n 1 2 we pose two questions for further study about possible generalizations of lech s limit formula and related asymptotic vanishing of koszul cohomology question 1 for a fixed local ring r m and finitely generated r module m which sequences of parameter ideals in mn satisfy lim n ein m m inm 1 question 2 for a fixed local ring r m and finitely generated r module m with dim r dim m which sequences of parameter ideals in mn satisfy lim n h i in m r in 0 for all 0 i dim m 5 an alternative approach we will begin by showing that if a module m is asymptotically cohen macaulay then m is cohen macaulay on the punctured spectrum our first step will be to show that if m is asymp totically cohen macaulay then m h 0 m m must be torsion free once we have that m h 0 m m is finite length local cohomology and bounds on koszul cohomology 9 torsion free we show that we may quotient by a non unit non zerodivisor and preserve the asymp totically cohen macaulay property at which point we are prepared to show that m is cohen macaulay on the punctured spectrum by induction lastly we will show by taking syzygies over an appropriately chosen cohen macaulay ring that this equivalence gives all of theorem 2 3 definition 5 1 let r be a ring and m an r module we call m torsion free if for each m m and r r whenever rm 0 m 0 or r p for some p ass r lemma 5 2 suppose r m is a complete regular local ring of dimension d 2 or a gorenstein ring of the form v x 1 xd p sx 1 with d 2 and s 1 where v v pv is a complete discrete valuation ring if m is dimension d and asymptotically cohen macaulay then m h 0 m m is torsion free proof because h 0 m m is finite length either m and m h 0 m m are both asymptotically cohen macaulay or neither is because the difference between any h i in m and h i in m h 0 m m is bounded by d i d i 1 h 0 m m from the long exact sequence of koszul cohomology while r in we may therefore replace m by m h 0 m m suppose t 6 0 is the torsion submodule of m t cannot be supported only at the maximal ideal because then t h 0 m m 0 let p r a prime ideal of height h d be minimal in supp t we will show that m is not d h effaceable first suppose that r is regular in which case r x 1 xd or r v x 2 xd where v v p k is a complete discrete valuation ring let y 1 yh or p y 1 yh 1 be local generators of p that extend to a system of parameters y 1 yd or p y 2 yd of r and form the regular ring s y 1 yd if r is equal characteristic or s v y 2 yd if r is mixed characteristic by clearing denominators we may without loss of generality assume that the local generators of p are elements of r this can be done in equal characteristic by prime avoidance by choosing y 1 a minimal generator of p and each yi for 2 i h a minimal generator of p not in the minimal primes of y 1 yi 1 in the mixed characteristic regular ring case we choose each yi to avoid p y 2 yi 1 and the minimal primes of p y 2 yi 1 p 2 rp r for 2 i h so that p will also be a parameter in s in the gorenstein case as in theorem 4 4 we will find appropriate y 1 yh to be a system of parameters of rp if x 1 p p take y 1 x 1 p choose the remaining yi by prime avoidance as above and form s v x 1 y 2 yd psx 1 if x 1 p 6 p take yd x 1 p choose the remaining yi by prime avoidance and form s v x 1 y 1 y 2 yd 1 psx 1 because p was a minimal prime of t we have s p s r p t m more concretely we have s s p s yh 1 yd m or s s p s v yh 1 yd 1 note that in the gorensein case we must have x 1 p or p p so that by our construction s p s will always be regular we aim to use these injections to split off as a direct summand of m over a smaller regular or gorenstein ring a torsion module of the form studied in section 6 let m be a maximal s submodule of m disjoint from s and n m m then s n is an essential extension and a retraction of the inclusion of s into n lifts to a retraction of the map to m we begin with the equal characteristic case for each i h there exists k 1 such that yi kn yh 1 yd yi n k yki n yh 1 yd 0 by the artin rees lemma but yi kn yh 1 yd 0 implies that yi kn 0 because the extension is essential therefore after replacing each yi with y ki i we may assume without loss of generality that yin 0 for all i h and view n as a module over yh 1 yd now because frac yh 1 yd is a maximal essential extension of yh 1 yd we may view n as a finitely generated submodule of 10 patricia klein frac yh 1 yd i e n yh 1 yd 1 f for some f yh 1 yd equivalently the essential extension we have been studying may be described as yh 1 yd f yh 1 yd choosing t 0 we may take f to be part of a basis of yh 1 yd over yth 1 ytd which means that our map splits as a map of yth 1 y t d modules and so as a map of a y 1 yh y t h 1 y t d modules in mixed characteristic we consider the case of p p and p p separately we first assume p p call a v yh 1 yd 1 because a injects into m a p injects into m p because a p is a discrete valuation ring mp must be free over a p and so we may choose an element u of a free basis of m p over a p and note that u pm p then a p m p given by 1 7 u is a splitting now because hom m p a p hom m a p the retraction m p a p with u 1 gives a map m a with u p a therefore there exists a map m f where f is a free a module and u p f now because t p y t h 1 y t d 1 f p f and u p f we may choose t sufficiently large that u p yth 1 ytd 1 f which is to say that u is not in the maximal ideal of b v yth 1 y t d 1 expanded to f because f is free over a and a is free over b f is free over b it follows that there is a retraction f a as b modules composing with a retraction a b and restriction to m we obtain a splitting of b m as b modules which gives a splitting as a v x 1 y 1 yh y t h 1 y t d 1 psx 1 modules lastly we suppose p p in which case a yh 1 yd thinking of yd x 1 p when x 1 p fix k so that pkm 0 but pk 1 m 6 0 as in the previous cases we replace each yi with some y ki i for 2 i h so that for each such i yim 0 and think of m as a module over b v x 1 yh 1 yd 1 pk psx 1 in the gorenstein case if x 1 p or over b v pk yh 1 yd in the regular case or in the gorenstein case if x 1 p for each t 0 set bt v pk yth 1 y t d or bt v xt 1 y t h 1 y t d 1 pk psxt 1 as is appropriate to the case we aim to find a t such that a copy of bt splits from m as a bt module because b p is a 0 dimensional gorenstein ring it splits from m p as in the previous case this gives a map m b with an element u m such that u p b again choose t sufficiently large that u p yth 1 ytd b or u p xt 1 yth 1 ytd 1 b as is appropriate to the case now b is free over bt and u is not in the expansion of the maximal ideal of bt to b so there is a bt module map b bt such that u 7 1 and so the composite map m b bt sends u to 1 which gives a splitting of bt from m as a bt module this map is also a splitting over a v y 2 yh y t h 1 y t d in the regular case over a v x 1 y 2 yh y t h 1 y t d psx 1 in the gorenstein case when x 1 p and over a v xt 1 y 2 yh y t h 1 y t d 1 psxt 1 in the gorenstein case when x 1 p we now have a module of the form of of theorem 6 5 or proposition 6 9 as a direct summand of m over a gorenstein ring which have named a in each case because r is module finite over a it is sufficient to find a sequence of parameter ideals in in a such that lim n hd h in m r inr 6 0 because r inr a r a in it is sufficient to show that lim n hd h in m a ina 6 0 finite length local cohomology and bounds on koszul cohomology 11 but m a a n or m bt a n for some a module n as is appropriate to the case and koszul homology splits over direct sums so for each n 1 h d h in m a in h d h in a a in or hd h in m a in h d h in bt a in as is appropriate to the case but by theorem 6 5 and proposi tion 6 9 lim n hd h in a a in 6 0 and lim n hd h in bt a in 6 0 and so lim n hd h in m a in 6 0 that is to say that m is not d h effaceable and in particular is not asymptotically cohen macaulay a contradiction lemma 5 3 let r m be a cohen macaulay local ring m a finitely generated r module with dim m dim r and x a non unit of r not a zerodivisor on m if m is asymptotically cohen macaulay over r then m xm is asymptotically cohen macaulay over r x proof fix r m and x as in the theorem statement by 3 4 we may assume that r and m are complete using the long exact sequence for koszul cohomology coming from the short exact sequence 0 syz 1 m rh m 0 we have 0 h i i m h i 1 i syz 1 m 0 for every i d 1 and every parameter idea li of r it follows that syz 1 m is asymptotically cohen macaulay whenever m is similarly from 0 syz 1 m xm r x g m xm 0 with g h we have 0 h i j m xm h i 1 j syz 1 m xm 0 for all i d 2 and every parameter ideal j of r x it follows that if m xm is not i effaceable for some i d 2 then syz 1 m xm syz 1 m x syz 1 m is not i 1 effaceable but syz 1 m must be asymptotically cohen macaulay because m is therefore we may assume by induction that i d 2 let 0 we aim to show that there exists n n such that for all parameter ideals i n hd 2 i m xm r x i r x we claim that syz 1 m is equidimensional fix p min syz 1 m and fix ring a that is either regular or gorenstein of the form v x 1 xd psx 1 for some s 1 where v is a complete discrete valuation ring with maximal ideal p over which r is module finite by lemma 4 3 syz 1 m is also asymptotically cohen macaulay over a and so by lemma 5 2 torsion free over a hence a p must also be an associated prime of a but then d dim a dim a a p dim r p as desired because a is gorenstein it therefore follows from 7 theorem 2 4 that there exists a constant csyz 1 m such that syz 1 m i syz 1 m csyz 1 m ei syz 1 m for every m primary ideal i of r now because m is asymptotically cohen macaulay over r we may fix n n such that for all parameter ideals i mn we have hd 1 i m r i csyz 1 m 2 fix an arbitrary parameter ideal j n and fix a d 1 generator lift j of j to r with j mn note that for every t 1 j xt is a parameter ideal of r for each t n we observe 12 patricia klein hd 2 j m xm r j x t hd 1 j x m t r j x t hd 1 j x m r j xt t hd 1 j x m hd 1 j xt m hd 1 j xt m r j xt t hd 1 j x m hd 1 j xt m csyz 1 m 2 hence it suffices to show that there exists t n such that hd 1 j x m hd 1 j xt m t 2 csyz 1 m we will separately bound the numerator from above and the denominator from below from 0 syz 1 m rh m 0 and the fact that r is cohen macaulay the long exact sequence of koszul cohomology gives 0 hd 1 j x m syz 1 m j x syz 1 m from which it follows that hd 1 j x m r syz 1 m r j x we now consider for each t 1 the short exact sequence 0 h d 2 j m xt hd 2 j m hd 2 j m xt m annm jm xt 0 from which we see that hd 1 j xt m hd 2 j m xt m hd 2 j m xt hd 2 j m because hd 2 j m is a one dimensional r j module there exists some t n such that for all t t hd 2 j m xt hd 2 j m t e x h d 2 j m 2 now hd 2 j m hd 1 j syz 1 m syz 1 m j syz 1 m because r is cohen macaulay and j is gen erated by d 1 elements it follows that e x h d 2 j m e x syz 1 m j syz 1 m e j x syz 1 m csyz 1 m syz 1 m j x syz 1 m finite length local cohomology and bounds on koszul cohomology 13 combining equations and we obtain a lower bound on the denominator for all t t hd 1 j xt m t hd 2 j m xt hd 2 j m t e x h d 2 j m 2 csyz 1 m 2 syz 1 m j x syz 1 m combining this lower bound with the upper bound on the denominator from we have for all t t hd 1 j x m hd 1 j xt m t 2 syz 1 m j x syz 1 m csyz 1 m syz 1 m j x syz 1 m 2 csyz 1 m finally by choosing n max n t we ensure that for all parameter ideals i n we have hd 2 i m xm r x i r x theorem 5 4 let r m be any local ring and m a finitely generated r module with dim m dim r if m is asymptotically cohen macaulay then m is cohen macaulay on the punctured spectrum proof using lemma 3 4 we may assume that r is complete by lemma 4 3 we may assume that r is either regular or gorenstein of the form v x 1 xd p sx 1 with d 2 and s 1 where v v pv is a complete discrete valuation ring we assume that m is asymptotically cohen macaulay after replacing m by m h 0 m m we may assume that m is torsion free by lemma 5 2 because all torsion free modules of dimension 1 are cohen macaulay we may assume that d 1 0 fix a prime p of r of height d 1 we aim to show that some system of parameters on mp is a regular sequence on mp we claim that depthmp 0 if mp has depth 0 then p is an associated prime of m equivalently of mp then because m is torsion free p must be an associated prime of r but then p has height 0 contradicting the assumption that p has height d 1 0 therefore we may fix x 1 xd 1 a system of parameters of mp with x 1 not a zerodivisor by 5 3 m x 1 m is asymptotically cohen macaulay and so m x 1 m is cohen macaulay on the punctured spectrum of r x 1 by induction hence m x 1 m p mp x 1 mp is cohen macaulay now because x 2 xd 1 is a system of parameters on rp x 1 rp it must also be a regular sequence it follows that x 1 xd 1 is a regular sequence on mp theorem 5 5 if m is a finitely generated module over the local ring r m of with dim m dim r d then the following three conditions are equivalent 1 m is asymptotically cohen macaulay 2 sup h i f 1 fd m f 1 fd m i d 3 m is equidimensional and cohen macaulay on the punctured spectrum proof it is obvious that 2 implies 1 using lemma 3 4 we may assume that r and m are complete and using lemma 4 3 we may assume that r satisfies the hypotheses of lemma 5 4 the implication 1 implies 3 follows from lemma 5 2 together with theorem 5 4 lastly 3 implies 2 is the case k d of theorem 4 2 using the same technique we give a result on rigidity of asymptotic depth under the assumption that m is quasi unmixed 14 patricia klein corollary 5 6 let m be a finitely generated quasi unmixed module over the local ring r m with dim m dim r d 1 fix 0 i d if m is i effaceable then m is j effaceable for every 0 j i proof using lemma 3 4 we may assume that r is complete and by lemma 4 3 gorenstein fix a module m of minimal dimension giving a counterexample to the theorem we may replace m by m h 0 m m without changin the problem and fix x m a non unit in r and non zerodivisor on m this proof will precede by describing appropriate modifications to lemma 5 3 by taking syzygies as in lemma 5 3 we may assume that m is d 1 effaceable and aim to show that it is asymptotically cohen macaulay because m is equidimensional so are all of its modules of syzygies and so we have a constant csyz 1 m as described in lemma 5 3 we may now follow the computations in lemma 5 3 identically to conclude that m xm is d 2 effaceable by induction asydepth m xm d 1 which is to say that m is asymptotically cohen macaulay but then m xm is cohen macaulay on the punctured spectrum by theorem 5 5 and so m is following the argument of theorem 5 4 then m is asymptotically cohen macaulay by theorem 5 5 as desired corollary 5 7 if m is a finitely generated module over the local ring r m of with dim m dim r d then the following three conditions are equivalent for every 0 k d 1 asydepth m k 2 sup h i f 1 fd m f 1 fd m i k 3 h im m for all i k proof as above it is clear that condition 2 implies condition 1 to see that 1 implies 3 fix a local gorenstein ring a n over which r m is module finite and take 0 syz 1 a m a m 0 for v a m we first establish the result over a if k d 1 then for any parameter ideal i of a hk i m hk 1 i syz 1 a m and h in m h i 1 n syz 1 a m we may then without loss of generality assume k d 1 which is the result of theorem 5 5 if condition 1 is satisfied over r then it is certainly satisfied over a because every system of parameters in a is a system of parameters in r it then follows that h im m h i n m for all i k which is to say that condition 3 is satisfied over r lastly 3 implies 2 is theorem 4 2 to finish the section we give a direct proof that an asmptotically cohen macaualy ring must always be quasi unmixed using a result of stu ckrad and vogel on the relationship between mul tiplicity and colength when m is not quasi unmixed their result is that over a ring with an infinite residue field if the set ei m m im i parameter is bounded away from 0 then m must be quasi unmixed 12 theorem 1 theorem 5 8 let r m be a local ring of dimension d if r is asymptotically cohen macaulay then r is quasi unmixed proof using 3 4 we may assume that r is complete replacing r by r t we assume that assume r is d 1 effaceable by corollary 5 6 this assumption is equivalent to the assumption that r is quasi unmixed so we are using the full power of our hypotheses then there exists some n n such that for all parameter ideals i mn hd 1 i r r i 1 2 let i f 1 fd be finite length local cohomology and bounds on koszul cohomology 15 any parameter ideal then ei r r i e fn 1 fn d r nd r i e fn 1 fn d r nd r fn 1 fnd 1 nd 1 hd 1 fn 1 f n d r r fn 1 f n d 1 2 nd and so the set ei m m im i parameter is bounded away from 0 it follows that m is quasi unmixed 12 theorem 1 6 quotients of surprisingly large length in this section we study modules that arise as quotients of regular rings and gorenstein rings of a specified form by ideals generated power series variables and powers of a generator of the maximal ideal of a discrete valuation ring in particular we study lengths of quotients of these modules by special choices of parameter ideals of the ambient ring and compare these lengths to the lengths of quotients of the ambient rings by those same ideals we will typically separate the theorems depending on whether the ambient ring is regular or merely gorenstein the proofs are very similar and the reader interested in getting a flavor for the arguments might prefer to read only proposition 6 1 theorem 6 5 and proposition 6 9 and might prefer to think only about the equal characteristic case proposition 6 1 if r x 1 xd with d 3 then m x 1 xd 1 r is not asymptotically cohen macaulay if r v x 1 x 2 xd 1 where v v p k is a discrete valuation ring then neither of m p x 1 xd 2 nor m x 1 xd 1 is asymptotically cohen macaulay in all cases n r m is also not asymptotically cohen macaulay in particular n is not 1 effaceable and m is not 2 effaceable proof before giving the general proof we will compute in detail the case of d 3 with r x y z as a guiding example let in z n 4 znxn yn znx xn 1 xzn 4 n yzn it is easy to see that r in x y n 4 and the computation below will show that r in n 4 2 n 2 n 1 2 3 n we claim that x 2 n 1 y 2 n 1 yz 2 n xz 3 n and zn 4 2 n are elements of in and so the elements zi with i n 4 2 n and ziyjzk with i 3 n j k 2 n 1 span the quotient r in as a k vector space though they will not in general form a basis the claimed inclusions can be seen in the following identities yz 2 n zn xn 1 xzn 4 n yzn x zn 4 znxn xz 3 n z 2 n yn znx ynz 2 n xn 1 yzn xn

patricia klein zn 4 2 n z 2 n zn 4 znxn xnz 3 n elements on the left can be seen to be in in as they are put in terms of elements already known to be in in on the righthand side of each equation because r is regular h i in r 0 for i 3 and so the long exact sequence of koszul coho mology yields 0 h 1 in z h 2 in m 0 because zn 4 is not a zerodivisor on z and the image of in in z is z n 4 0 0 we have that h 1 in n h 0 0 0 z zn 4 r in x y whose length is n 4 from the long exact sequence above n 4 must also be the length of h 2 in m now because lim n h 2 in m r in lim n n 4 n 4 2 n 2 n 1 2 3 n 1 0 m is not 2 effaceable and so in particular is not asymptotically cohen macaulay we now consider all dimensions d 3 letr x y z v 1 vd 3 m x y v 1 vd 3 r or r v y z v 1 vd 3 and m p y v 1 vd 3 in which case we will denote p by x be low or r v x y v 1 vd 3 and m x y v 1 vd 3 in which case we will denote p by z below in all cases take n r m from the short exact sequence 0 m r n 0 and the fact that r is regular we know h i in m h i 1 in z or h i in m h i 1 in v for all i d 1 we aim to show that n is not 1 effaceable and so that m is not 2 effaceable we define in f 1 fd where f 1 z t znxn f

very large relative to n as in the 3 dimensional case we may use the first two equation to show yz 2 n in we then find d 3 i 1 1 i 1 viz 3 n 1 d 1 xz 3 n z 2 nf 3 yz 2 n in we will now show by induction on i that viz 3 ni 1 ni n and d 3 j i 1 1 jvjz 3 n i 2 ni 1 n 2 n 1 d xz 3 ni 2 ni 1 n 2 n are elements of in for all 1 i d 3 if i 1 then using that modulo in v 1 z 3 n d 3 j 2 1 jvjz 3 n 1 d xz 3 n implies that modulo in v 1 z 3 n n d 3 j 2 1 jviz 3 n 1 d xz 3 n n finite length local cohomology and bounds on koszul cohomology 17 we compute v 1 z 3 n 2 n v 1 z 3 n 2 n zt znxn z 3 n 2 f 4 v 1 z 3 n n d 3 j 2 1 jviz 3 n 1 d xz 3 n n where the right hand side consists of elements known to be in in it follows that d 3 j 2 1 jvjz 3 n 2 n 1 d xz 3 n 2 n z 3 n 2 f 3 v 1 z 3 n 2 n ynz 3 n 2 in for the inductive step we compute vi 1 z 3 n i 2 ni 1 n 2 n vi 1 z 3 ni 2 ni 1 n 2 n zt znxn z 3 ni 2 ni 1 n 2 fi 4 vi 1 z 3 n i 1 ni n 2 n n d 3 j i 2 vjz 3 ni 1 ni n 2 n 1 d 1 xz 3 ni 1 ni n 2 n

that vd 3 z 3 nd 2 nd 3 n 2 n in and that 1 d 3 vd 3 z 3 n d 2 nd 3 n 2 n 1 dxz 3 nd 2 nd 3 n 2 n in and so xz 3 n d 2 nd 3 n 2 n in as well in particular xz 3 n d 2 nd 3 n 2 n yz 3 n d 2 nd 3 n 2 n and viz 3 nd 2 nd 3 n 2 n are ele ments of in for all 1 i d 3 now using f 2 xn 1 xzt n yzn we notice that modulo in xn 1 3 n d 3 nd 4 n 2 n xzt n yzn 3 nd 3 nd 4 n 2 n 0 and then that zt 3 n d 2 nd 3

n 0 because x n 1 3 n d 3 nd 4 n 2 n in and viz 3 n d 2 nd 3 n 2 n in for each 1 i d 3 and so any product of n 0 elements each of which is divisible either by x or by z n is an element of in provided that whenever it is not divisible by x n 1 3 nd 3 nd 4 n 2 n it is divisible by some vi for 1 i d 3 when k 0 we use fd vnd 3 vd 3 zt n xn vd 3 zn vd 3 xn to see that modulo in v n 0 d 3 vd 3 z t n xn

is now clear that r in is spanned by xz j yzj and viz j for j 3 nd 2 nd 3 n 2 n and 1 i d 3 together with zj for j t 3 nd 2 nd 3 n 2 and x xy yv 1 1 v d 3 d 3 with y n 3 n d 3 nd 4 n 1 and x n 1 3 n d

ways to pick an allowable monomial that is not a power of z for n 0 as in the 3 dimensional case h 2 in m h 1 in n h 0 0 0 z zt r in x y v 1 vd 3 whose length is easily seen to be t because r in

discrete valuation ring m pk x 1 xd 2 r and n r m v pk xd 1 with d 2 and k 1 then n is not 1 effaceable and m is not 2 effaceable finite length local cohomology and bounds on koszul cohomology 19 proof we proceed by induction on k the case k 1 is proposition 6 1 for k 1 we use the short exact sequence 0 pk 1 n n v pk 1 xd 1 0 and the fact that v pk 1 xd has depth 1 to obtain an injection h 1 i pk 1 n h 1 i n from the long exact sequence of koszul cohomology for every parameter ideal i the result now follows from the isomorphisms pk 1 n xd 1 and h 1 i n h 2 i m we now prove the results of proposition 6 1 and corollary 6 2 over a the ring that is a certain type of gorenstein ring rather than regular proposition 6 3 let r v x 1 xd psx 1 with d 3 where v v pv is a discrete valuation ring and s 1 then neither m p x 1 xd 1 nor m x 1 xd nor m p x 2 xd is asymptotically cohen macaulay in all cases n r m is also not asymptotically cohen macaulay in particular n is not 1 effaceable and m is not 2 effaceable proof as in proposition 6 1 we consider the short exact sequence 0 m r n 0 and using that r is cohen macaulay and dimension at least 3 note that h 2 i m h 1 i n for every parameter ideal i we will again choose parameter ideals in so that h 1 in n r in p for some prime ideal p of r with r p v or r p y for some indeterminate y set in f 1 fd where f 1 z t zn x p n f 2 x p n 1 x p

generators used in propostion 6 1 except that x p replaces x everywhere it appears we now follow identically the computations of proposition 6 1 borrowing its notation with x replaced by x p to see that that x p n 1 3 nd 3 nd 4 n 2 n zt 3 nd 2 nd 3 n 2 yn 3 n d 3 nd 4 n 1 and v 2 d 4 n 1 3 nd 3 nd 4 n 2 n 3 nd 2 nd 3 n 2 n i for 1 i d 3 are elements of in multiplying the first element by x or by p we have x n 2 3 n d 3 nd 4 n 2 n and pn 2 3 n d 3 nd 4 n 2 n elements of in as well similarly x p z 3 n d 2 nd 3 n 2 n yz 3 n d 2 nd 3 n 2 n and viz 3 nd 2 nd 3 n 2 n are elements of in for 1 i d 3 again we multiply the first of these last three elements by x or by p to find x 2 z 3 n d 2 nd 3 n 2 n and p 2 z 3 n d 2 nd 3 n 2 n as elements of in as well it is this final modification that prevents us from establishing a limit of 1 as we were able to in proposition 6 1 we now count elements spanning r in as in proposition 6 1 with the different that we must also allow xzj and pzj for j small enough that zj in we note that r in is spanned by x 2 zj p 2 zj yzj and viz j for j 3 nd 2 nd 3 n 2 n and 1 i d 3 together with zj pzj and xzj for j t 3 nd 2 nd 3 n 2 and x xpy yv 11 v d 3 d 3

and so if lim n n inn r in exists then 1 lim n n inn r in lim n t r in 3 t 3 nd 2 nd 3 n 2 8 2 n d 2 d 1 3 for every t nd 2 because n inn r in h 1 in n r in h 2 in m r in this completes the proof corollary 6 4 let r v x 1 xd psx 1 with d 3 where v v pv is a discrete valuation ring and s 1 then neither m pk x 1 xd 1 r nor m pk x 2 xd r for any k 1 is asymptotically cohen macaulay in all cases n r m is also not asymptotically cohen macaulay in particular n is not 1 effaceable and m is not 2 effaceable proof we proceed by induction on k the case k 1 is proposition 6 3 for k 1 if m pk x 1 xd 1 r or if m p k x 2 xd r and k s we may follow identically the proof of corollary 6 2 if m pk x 2 xd r and k s observe that the short exact sequence 0 x 1 n n n x 1 n 0 gives rise to h 0 i v pk h 1 i x 1 n h 1 i n for each parameter ideal i so that h 1 i n h 1 i x 1 n k noting that x 1 n v x 1 ps which is the case of s k completes the proof theorem 6 5 suppose r x 1 xd with d 3 and m x 1 xd h r or that r v x 1 xd 1 and m x 1 xd h r or m p x 2 xd h r or some 1 h d 1 then neither m nor n r m is asymptotically cohen macaulay in particular m is not h 1 effaceable and n is not h effaceable proof we will proceed by induction on h the base case h 1 is proposition 6 1 for the inductive step we consider the following short exact sequences 0 x 1 xd h 1 r x 1 xd h r xd h xd h xd 0 or 0 x 1 xd h 1 r x 1 xd h r xd h v xd h xd 1 0 or 0 x 2 xd h r p x 2 xd h r p v x 1 xd h 1 xd 1 0 call the module appearing as the cokernel in each of these sequences ac where a xd h or a p and c xd h xd c v xd h xd 1 or c v x 1 xd h 1 xd 1 call the middle term of each sequence d and the left hand term e we observe that the depth of e is h 2 and the depths of d and ac are h 1 we therefore have 0 hh 1 in d hh 1 in ac which shows that ac c is not h 1 effaceable since d is not by the inductive hypothesis we now consider another short exact sequence 0 e r c 0 for each c and e defined above because r has depth d h 2 by assumption the long exact sequence of koszul homology yields 0 hh 1 in c hh 2 in e finite length local cohomology and bounds on koszul cohomology 21 and so e is not h 2 effaceable because c is not h 1 effaceable completing the induction because r is cohen macaulay the short exact sequence 0 m r n 0 gives immediately that whenever m is not h 1 effaceable n is not h effaceable for 1 h d 1 corollary 6 6 if r v x 1 xd 1 and m p k x 2 xd h for some k 1 and 1 h d 1 then neither m nor n r m is asymptotically cohen macaulay in particular m is not h 1 effaceable and n is not h effaceable proof using induction on h the base case is proposition 6 3 we now follow the proof of theorem 6 5 using the short exact sequence 0 x 2 xd h r pk x 2 xd h r pk v xd h xd 0 or 0 pk x 2 xd h 1 r pk x 2

neither m nor n r m is asymptotically cohen macaulay in particular m is not h 1 effaceable and n is not h effaceable proof the base case h 1 is proposition 6 3 for the inductive step we follow the

then neither m nor n r m is asymptotically cohen macaulay in particular m is not h 1 effaceable and n is not h effaceable proof we follow the proof of corollary 6 4 using theorem 6 7 for the base case k 1 proposition 6 9 let r x 1 xd or r v x 1 xd 1 where v v pv is a discrete valuation ring and n x 1 xd xd x 1 xd 1 n v x 1 xd 1 p k v pk x 1 xd 1 for k 1 22 patricia klein or n v x 1 xd 1 xd 1 v x 1 xd 2 then n is not d 1 effaceable for d 2 proof call the generator of the principle ideal by which we are quotienting r by to obtain n in each case a we note that the techniques of the previous lemmas do not work here because ar r using the short exact sequence 0 r a r n 0 we get the long exact sequence 0 hd 1 in n r in r in n inn 0 from which we see that hd 1 in n n inn it is therefore sufficient to give a family of ideals in such that lim n r a in r in 6 0 we have previously discussed such families for d 3 since r a x 1 xd 2 in r a in for d 2 we may use the family in x n 1 1 x 1 xn 2 xn 3 2 x n 1 with x 2 p when r v x 1 it is clear that r x 1 in n 3 and because neither x 1 nor x n 1 xn 2 is a zerodivisor on r xn 3 2 x n 1 we may compute r in r x 1 x n 3 2 r x n 1 xn 2 xn 3 2 x n 1 notice that x 21 xn 2 xn 3 2 x n 1 x n 2 1 x n 3 n 2 and so x n 1 x n 2 in hence r in r x 1 x n 3 2 r x n 1 xn 2 xn 3 2 x n 1 n 3 n 2 of course lim n n 3 n 3 n 2 1 6 0 we give the corresponding proposition over a gorenstein ring of the desired type proposition 6 10 let r v x 1 xd p sx 1 where v v pv is a discrete valuation ring and s 1 then neither n r pk xd for any k 1 nor n r x 1 xd is d 1 effaceable for d 2 proof as in the proceeding proposition we let a pk if n v x 1 xd p k xd and a x 1 if n v x 1 xd x 1 xd again we note that it is sufficient to find a sequence of parameter ideals in mn such that lim n r a in r in 6 0 and that we need only consider d 2 because r p in r pk in k r p in for each k 1 it is sufficient to consider the case k 1 we will take in x n 1 2 x 2 p x 1 n p x 1 n 3 xn 2 it is clear that v x 1 x 2 in a x 2 n 3 meanwhile min xn 12 x 2 p x 1 n p x 1 n 3 yn x 2 p x 1 for all n 1 and so neither p nor x 1 is a zerodivisor on v x 1 x 2 xn 12 x 2 p x 1 n p x 1 n 3 yn therefore v x 1 x 2 in psx 1 v x 1 x 2 in ps v x 1 x 2 in x 1 s v x 1 x 2 in p v x 1 x 2 in x 1 the computation of v x 1 x 2 in p and v x 1 x 2 in x 1 are symmetric and both equal to n 3 n 2 following the computation in proposition 6 9 therefore lim n r a x 2 in r in n 3 s 1 n 3 n 2 1 s 1 6 0 finite length local cohomology and bounds on koszul cohomology 23 completing the proof references 1 b bhatt
