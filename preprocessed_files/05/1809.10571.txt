that biject with alternating sign matri ces the notions of weak order and descent sets for permutations are generalized here to monotone triangles and shown to enjoy many analogous properties it is shown that any linear extension of the weak order gives rise to a shelling order on a poset recently introduced by terwilliger whose maximal chains biject with monotone triangles among these shellings are a family of el shellings the weak order turns out to encode an action of the 0 hecke monoid of type a on the monotone triangles generalizing the usual bubble sorting action on permutations it also leads to a notion of descent set for monotone triangles having another natural property the surjective algebra map from the malvenuto reutenauer hopf algebra of permutations into quasisymmetric functions extends in a natural way to an algebra map out of the recently defined cheballah giraudo maurice algebra of alternating sign matrices 1 introduction permutations in the symmetric group sn on n letters when thought of as n n permutation matrices are special cases of fascinating objects known as alternating sign matrices asms the latter have been intensely studied since their introduction by mills robbins and rumsey 12 and turn out to be connected with such areas as statistical mechanics representation theory and number theory see bressoud 6 and brubaker bump and friedberg 7 for more history and context we recall their definition here as well as their bijection with the equivalent objects known as monotone triangles a vector in 0 1 n is called alternating if its 1 values alternate in sign beginning and ending with 1 denote by altn the set of all such alternating vectors of length n an n n alternating sign matrix is one whose row and column vectors all lie in altn denote by asmn the set of all such matrices for example we depict here on the left a matrix a in asm 6 abbreviating and for entries 1 and 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a t 2 2 4 1 3 6 1 3 4 6 1 2 3 5 6 there is a simple bijection between asmn and the set mtn of monotone triangles of size n a monotone triangle of size n is a sequence t t 0 t 1 tn 1 tn of subsets of n 1 2 n where tm m with the extra property that tm 1 interlaces tm in this sense if one list entries of tm tm 1 in increasing order as tm i 1 i 2 im tm 1 j 1 j 2 jm jm 1 then one has 2 j 1 i 1 j 2 i 2 j 3 jm im jm 1 one depicts t as a triangular array having tm as its m th row from the top omitting t 0 tn n for example t 2 2 4 1 3 6 1 3 4 6 1 2 3 5 6 6 mt 6 is shown on the right in 1 for the sake of defining the bijections asmn mtn first introduce the indicator vector 1 s in 0 1 n for a subset s n having coordinates 1 s i 1 for i s and 1 s i 0 for i 6 s then given a in asmn 1991 mathematics subject classification 05 axx

one maps a 7 t t 0 tn in mtn whose m th row tm is the unique subset for which 1 tm is the sum of the first m rows of a the inverse bijection sends t 7 a where the mth row of a is 1 tm 1 tm 1 for example the matrix a in asm 6 shown on the left in 1 above has corresponding monotone triangle t in mt 6 shown to its right it is not hard to check see terwilliger 17 thm 3 2 that an m 1 subset j n interlaces an m set i n if and only if the difference of the indicator vectors 1 j 1 i lies in altn thus mtn is in bijection with the maximal chains of a partial order on the subsets of n that is the transitive closure of the relation i j when j interlaces i terwilliger denotes this partial order n note that this partial order n is stronger than the usual boolean algebra poset 2 n whose order relation is given by inclusion and whose maximal chains are the monotone triangles of the form t w w 1 w 1 w 2 w 1 w 2 wn 1 n which correspond to the permutations w w 1 w 2 wn in sn this monotone triangle t w also corresponds to the usual permutation matrix of w 1 thinking of permutation matrices as a subset of asmn the hasse diagram for the poset 3 on subsets of 3 is shown below with solid edges indicating the weaker boolean algebra 2 3 ordering and the unique extra order relation 2 1 3 from 3 shown dotted 1 2 3 1 2 sss 1 3 2 3 1 ssss 2 ssss 3 rrrrr section 2 explores properties of the order n including characterizing it via a generalization of interlacing one of our original goals was to show that n is a shellable poset a notion that we review here say that an abstract simplicial complex is pure if all of its facets inclusion maximal simplices have the same number of vertices in this case say that an ordering f 1 f 2 of the facets of is a pure shelling if for every j 2 the intersection of the boundary of fj with the subcomplex generated by the facets f 1 fj 1 forms a pure subcomplex of codimension one within the boundary of fj said differently for any pair 1 i j there exists k j such that fi fj fk fj with fk fj fj 1 having a shelling for imposes strong topological properties for its geometric realization and strong algebraic properties for its stanley reisner ring k see bjo rner 1 appendix and 3 1 here we are starting with a partially ordered set p having both a bottom element 0 and top element 1 such as the boolean algebra 2 n with inclusion order on subsets of n or the order n on subsets where in either case 0 and 1 n in this setting one often removes the bottom and top elements and associates an abstract simplicial complex called the order complex to its proper part so that has vertex set p 0 1 and simplices for each totally ordered subset of p 0 1 this means that facets of biject with maximal chains of p as mentioned above for p n and its subposet the boolean algebra 2 n these facets or maximal chains are naturally labeled by the monotone triangles mtn and permutations sn respectively we illustrate this here for n 3 depicting the order complex 3 0 1 with one extra facet edge shown dotted whose removal gives the subcomplex 2 3 0 1 3 3 3 2 3 2 3 2 2 3 1 3 2 1 3 3 1 3 rrrrrrrrr 1 1 3 2 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 rrrrrrrrr 2 for the boolean algebra 2 n this order complex 2 n 0 1 is isomorphic to the coxeter complex of type an 1 and a result of bjo rner 3 thm 2 1 shows that it is shellable with a shelling order on its facets provided by any linear ordering on the permutations sn that extends the right weak order w this weak order is the transitive closure of the relation in which wsi w w if w w 1 wn has wi wi 1 where si i i 1 is an adjacent transposition one can view this weak order as induced from the action of the bubble sorting operators 1 n 1 on sn 4 w i wsi if wi wi 1 w if wi wi 1 which satisfy the relations of the 0 hecke monoid of type an 1 5 i j j i if j i 2 i i 1 i i 1 i i 1 2 i i note that i acts on right this notational choice highlights the relationship between the application of i and multiplication on the right by si one may then define the right weak order by w w w if and only if w lies in the 0 hecke orbit of w section 3 extends this 0 hecke action from sn to mtn by letting t i replace the i th row of the monotone triangle t with the componentwise smallest row that still forms a monotone triangle with the remaining rows one can then extend the weak order w from sn to mtn by setting t t whenever t lies in the 0 hecke orbit of t for n 3 these actions of h 3 0 on s 3 and mt 3 look as follows illustrating the weak order posets w on both 3 2 3 2 1 3 1 3 1 2 1 3 1 2 2 2 3 2 1 1 3 2 2 1 2 1 1 1 2 section 4 then uses this to prove our first main result theorem 1 1 linear extensions of w on mtn give shelling orders on n there is another sense in which the terminology weak order is appropriate lascoux and schu tzenberger 10 showed that the componentwise order on mtn is a distributive lattice one that turns out to be the macneille completion of the strong bruhat order b on sn we therefore refer to this componentwise order on mtn as its strong bruhat order b depicted below is the the poset mt 3 b with the usual bruhat order s 3 b as a subposet and dotted edges indicating the order relation to the unique element t in mt 3 s 3 3 2 3 tt tt 3 1 3 2 2 3 2 1 3 1 1 3 2 1 2 tt tt 1 1 2 3 it turns out see remark 3 5 that this bruhat order b on mtn is stronger than the weak order w defined above in particular any linear extension of the componentwise order gives rise to a shelling of n the weak order shellings provided by theorem 1 1 have another tight analogy to the weak order shellings of the boolean posets 2 n in that they contain as a special case certain el shellings a notion which we recall here given a poset p with c p x y x y p its set of cover relations x y means x y but 6 z with x z y an el labeling of p is a function c p where is any poset having these properties for every interval x y p there is a unique maximal chain x x 0 x 1 xk y that has weakly rising labels x 0 x 1 x 1 x 2 xk 1 xxk if x z y with z 6 x 1 then x x 1 x z for example the boolean algebras 2 n have a very simple el labeling it assigns a covering relation between subsets i j with j i 1 the unique integer i j j such that j i j here the labels come from the poset 1 2 n with the usual ordering on integers a poset is el shellable or lexicographically shellable if it admits an el labeling bjo rner 1 thm 2 3 showed that for a poset with an el labeling one obtains a shelling order on its maximal chains via any linear extension of the lexicographic extension of to sequences of edge labels in section 5 we prove the following theorem 1 2 there is a partial order on altn so that the edge labeling which assigns i j 1 j 1 i in altn becomes an el labeling of n furthermore any of the el shelling orders associated with this labeling will be a linear order on mtn that extends the weak order w the weak order shellings and el shellings in theorems 1 1 1 2 show that n is a cohen macaulay poset and allow one to combinatorially re interpret its flag f vector f n fj j n 1 here fj is the number of chains in n that pass through the ranks in j one can instead consider the flag h vector h n fj j n 1 defined by an inclusion exclusion relation fj i j hi or equivalently hj j i 1 j ifi general shelling theory then implies this combinatorial interpretation for hj hj n t mtn des t j here one is led to define the descent set des t for a monotone triangle t as follows via the following generalization of the usual descent set des w i n 1 wi wi 1 that is w i 6 w for permutations w in sn des t i n 1 t i 6 t section 6 discusses this descent set des t and collects some data on its distribution over mtn there is a further way in which this notion of a descent set for monotone triangles extends a pleasant property of descents for permutations recall that malvenuto and reutenauer 11 defined a graded hopf algebra sometimes denoted fqsym n 0 fqsymn where fqsymn has z basis elements w indexed by permutations w in sn the ring structure is determined by a shuffle product for u v in sn sm defined as uv w u v n w in which the sum runs over all shuffles w of u u 1 un and v n v 1 n vm n this shuffle product was introduced in such a way as to make a ring and hopf algebra morphism into the quasisymmetric functions qsym defined by 6 fqsym qsym w 7 l des w 4 here l denotes gessel s fundamental quasisymmetric function associated to a composition and des w is the composition whose partial sums give the elements of des w see 16 7 19 and section 7 below recently cheballah giraudo and maurice embedded fqsym inside a larger graded hopf algebra asm whose nth graded component has a basis a indexed by a in asmn 8 and whose product and coproduct extend that of fqsym section 7 proves the following theorem 1 3 the map fqsym qsym in 6 extends to an algebra but not a coalgebra morphism asm qsym a 7 l des a where des a des t a for an alternating sign matrix a is the descent set of its monotone triangle t a sections 8 concludes by comparing poset properties of the weak order on mtn with analogous properties for the weak order on sn including a conjecture for the homotopy type of

feedback on an earlier draft leading to numerous improvements including his illuminating example this work began during the fall 2017 msri semester in geometric and topological combinatorics 2 interlacing monotone trapezoids and the order n the goal here is to relate terwilliger s order n with the notions of interlacing and monotone trapezoids definition 2 1 start with the componentwise order comp on subsets i i n of the same cardinality k for 0 k n i i 1 i 2 ik i i 1 i 2 i k defined by setting i comp i if im i m for m 1 2 k for j j 1 j n with j k i say that j interlaces i written i lace j if j 1 j 2 jk comp i comp j k 1 j k 2 j 1 j note that when j k 1 i 1 this condition i lace j is the usual definition of j interlacing i as given in 2 earlier one then has the following proposition which is easily checked or see 17 3 proposition 2 2 if j i 1 then i lace j if and only if 1 j 1 i lies in altn one can also readily check that lace is a partial order that is i lace j lace k implies i lace k this partial order lace is closely related to monotone trapezoids and terwilliger s order n as we now explain definition 2 3 an i j monotone trapezoid is a sequence of subsets t ik ik 1 i 1 i of 1 2 with ik i i j im m and im lace im 1 for k m in other words an i j monotone trapezoid is a saturated chain in lace from i to j when i j n one calls t a monotone triangle of size n proposition 2 4 the following are equivalent for subsets i j n a there exists at least one i j monotone trapezoid b i n j c i lace j in proving this proposition and in the sequel the following construction will be useful 5 definition 2 5 for i lace j with i k and j k 2 define hmin i j h 1 h 2 hk 1 by the rule 7 hm max im 1 jm and convention ip 0 for p 0 thus when k 0 so that i then hmin j j 1 lemma 2 6 the set hmin i j has these properties i it is a k 1 subset that is h 1 hk 1 ii it lies in the family h n k 1 i lace h lace j iii every h in this family has hmin i j comp h proof assertion i the definition of hmin i j implies hm hm 1 since hm max im 1 jm max im 1 jm 1 1 max im jm 1 1 hm 1 1 assertion ii we must show two lace inequalities or equivalently four comp inequalities two of the four come from im 1 jm max im 1 jm hm for m 1 2 k 1 which shows both that i comp h 2 hk 1 and also that j 1 jk 1 comp hmin i j the inequality h 1 hk comp i comes from hm max im 1 jm max im jm im which uses im 1 im and the fact that j 1 jm comp i since i lace j the last inequality hmin i j j k j k 1 j 1 j comes from hm max im 1 jm j k m 1 which uses jm j k m 1 as k 2 and im 1 j k m 1 as i lace j assertion iii any such h h 1 h k 1 has i lace h lace j implying for 1 m k 1 that h m im 1 coming from i comp h 2 h 3 h k 1 h m jm coming from j 1 jm comp h thus h m max im 1 jm hm that is hmin i j comp h as desired with the construction hmin i j and its properties in hand one can now prove proposition 2 4 proof of proposition 2 4 note a b via proposition 2 2 and definition of n then a c from the transitivity of lace while c a follows by induction on j i via lemma 2 6 remark 2 7 it is worth pointing out an involutive poset symmetry in n coming from the action of the longest permu tation w 0 n n 1 2 1 in sn this permuation w 0 acts on subsets as follows i i 1 i 2 ik w 0 7 w 0 i n 1 ik n 1 i 2 n 1 i 1 since i j if and only if n 1 i n 1 j this action of w 0 preserves the interlacing inequalities 2 that define the covering relations i n j thus it is an involutive automorphism of the poset n and therefore also gives an involution on monotone triangles t t 0 t 1 tn w 0 7 w 0 t w 0 t 0 w 0 t 1 w 0 tn passing through the bijection asmn mtn the corresponding involution w 0 acting on a matrix a aij in asmn simply reflects it through a vertical axis w 0 a ai n 1 j due to this w 0 symmetry for i lace j with j i 2 instead of defining the set hmin i j as in definition 2 5 we could have defined a set hmax i j h 1 h 2 h k 1 via two equivalent formulas 8 h m min im jm 1 k for m 1 2 k 1 with convention ik 1 or hmax i j w 0 hmin w 0 i w 0 j 6 one would then have the corresponding properties as in lemma 2 6 namely that hmax i j is actually a k 1 subset that it lies between i and j in the order lace and that it is the componentwise maximum among all such k 1 subsets between i and j we simply chose here to use hmin i j not hmax i j the key property that we will need for shellability of n is that for any pair i lace j there is a componentwise smallest i j monotone trapezoid and that it can be characterized locally lemma 2 8 fixing i lace j the following are equivalent for an i j monotone trapezoid t i ik ik 1 i 1 i j a im hmin im 1 j for m k 1 k 2 1 b im hmin im 1 im 1 for m k 1 k 2 1 c the elements of im h m 1 h m 2 h m m are h m p max jp ip k m with iq 0 for q 0 d t is the componentwise smallest among all i j monotone trapezoids proof first check that if t satisfies a then its entries have the formula from c using induction on m the base case m k 1 comes from the definition of hmin ik j the inductive step is this calculation h m p max jp h m 1 p 1 max jp max jp ip 1 k m 1 max jp ip k m next check that if t satisfies b then its entries obey the formula from c this time using induction on j i k assume that b holds for the trapezoid t so im h m 1 h m 2 h m m hmin i m 1 i m 1 this means that 9 h m p max h m 1 p h m 1 p 1 by restriction condition b also holds for the smaller trapezoid im im 1 i 1 i j and hence by induction one has h m 1 p max jp h m p 1 similarly by restriction condition b also holds for the smaller trapezoid i ik ik 1 im 1 im and hence by induction one has h m 1 p 1 max h m p 1 ip 1 k m 1 plugging these last two expressions into 9 one concludes that h m p max max jp h m p 1 max h m p 1 ip 1 k m 1 max jp h m p 1 ip k m max jp ip k m since h m p 1 h m p this last expression is the one from c as desired thus since a does define a monotone trapezoid having i j as its bottom top rows then t satisfiying b or c is equivalent to t being the one defined by a to see c d let t i i k i k 1 i 1 i j be an i j monotone trapezoid with i m i 1 i m then i p max jp ip k m by the inequalities defining monotone trapezoids since the sets defined using c form an i j monotone trapezoid we see they must form the minimal i j monotone trapezoid and vice versa remark 2 9 it should not be surprising that there exists a componentwise smallest i j monotone trapezoid as in lemma 2 8 since lascoux and schu tzenberger 10 5 showed that the componentwise order on mtn has meet and join operations given by componentwise minimum and maximum similarly there is a componen twise largest such i j monotone trapezoid having similar properties which can be built in a analogous fashion by iterating the hmax i j construction from remark 2 7 7 3 action of hn 0 and the weak order recall from the introduction 5 that the 0 hecke monoid hn 0 for the symmetric group sn or type an 1 is the monoid with n 1 generators 1 2 n 1 subject to the usual braid relations 10 i j j i for i j 2 i i 1 i i 1 i i 1 for i 1 2 n 2 together with the quadratic relations 11 2 i i for i 1 2 n 1 see norton 13 for background on hn 0 and the associated monoid algebra called a 0 hecke algebra definition 3 1 define maps i mtn mtn for i 1 2 n 1 sending t 7 t i where t i is obtained from t by replacing its ith row ti with hmin ti 1 ti 1 proposition 3 2 the operators i on mtn satisfy the braid and quadratic relations 10 11 and hence define an action of hn 0 on mtn proof the relations 2 i i and i j j i for i j 2 should be clear only i i 1 i i 1 i i 1 requires verification we can check this locally in rows i 1 i i 1 i 2 of a monotone triangle t by tracking two generic entries in rows i i 1 shown in bold below here we are using concatenation of sets of entries to abbreviate their maximum a b c d e f g h i i 7 a b af bg f g h i i 1 7 a b af bg afi h i i 7 a b abfi afi h i a b c d e f g h i i 1 7 a b c d e ch di h i i 7 a b ach bdi ch di h i i 1 7 a b ach bdi achi h i thus it only remains to check these equalities max a b f i max b d i 12 max a f i max a c h i 13 which both follow since a d b and f i implies that the two sides in 12 are both equal to max b i c h f i implies that the two sides in 13 are both equal to max a i once one knows that the operators i satisfy the braid relations one can define operators w for every permutation w in sn as follows pick any factorization w si 1 si 2 si for w that is shortest possible i e reduced as a product of the adjacent transpositions s 1 s 2 sn 1 s and then let w i 1 i 2 i as a consequence of satisfying the relations of hn 0 one could equivalently define w recursively as follows 14 w i wsi if w i w i 1 that is if i 6 des w w if w i w i 1 that is if i des w starting with the initial condition e 1 8 remark 3 3 it is worth noting in the case where t has ti ti 1 for all i so that t t w w 1 w 1 w 2 w 1 w 2 wn 1 n for some permutation w w 1 w 2 wn in sn then one has t w i t w if wi wi 1 that is if i 6 des w t wsi if wi wi 1 that is if i des w here si i i 1 is the adjacent transposition so that wsi w 1 w 2 wi 1 wi 1 wi wi 2 wn 1 wn thus the action of hn 0 on mtn extends its action on sn via bubble sorting operators as mentioned in the introduction we let w i denote the permutation corresponding to t w i so that t w i t w i definition 3 4 extend the weak order w on the symmetric group sn to a weak order w on monotone triangles mtn as the transitive closure of the relations t i t where i is any index in the range 1 2 n 1 equivalently t w t means that t lies in the hn 0 orbit of t remark 3 5 the name weak order is appropriate here since mtn w is indeed weaker than the componentwise order mtn b and we view the latter as the appropriate extension of strong bruhat order on sn to a strong bruhat order on mtn via macneille completion to see that mtn w is weaker than the componentwise order note that it is the transitive closure of the relations t i w t where t i is obtained from t by replacing the ith row of t with hmin ti 1 ti 1 the latter being componentwise smaller by lemma 2 6 4 proof of theorem 1 1 recall the statement of the theorem theorem 1 1 any linear extension t 1 t 2 t n of w on mtn gives a shelling order on n before proving the theorem we note in the next proposition a useful reinterpretation of lemma 2 8 generalizing the definition of the t i on monotone triangles given any subset j s s 1 sn 1 recall there is a unique longest permutation w 0 j in the young or parabolic subgroup j of sn generated by j this w 0 j is an involution characterized within j by the property that 15 j des w 0 j des w 0 j 1 here we identify j sj 1 sjk with j 1 jk for example if n 9 and j s 1 s 2 s 4 s 5 s 6 s 8 s 1 s 2 s 8 s then the parabolic subgroup j inside s 9 is the subgroup isomorphic to s 3 s 4 s 2 that stabilizes the blocks of the partition 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 its longest permutation is w 0 j 3 2 1 7 6 5 4 9 8 proposition 4 1 given any monotone triangle t and j s then t w 0 j is the unique componentwise smallest monotone triangle tmin having the same rows tm as t for all sm 6 j proof lemma 2 8 b shows that this componentwise smallest triangle tmin is uniquely characterized by tminm tm for sm 6 j hmin t min m 1 t min m 1 for sm j on the other hand we claim that the triangle t t w 0 j has these same properties t t w 0 j shares the same rows t m tm for sm 6 j since w 0 j lies in j for any sm j one has t m t w 0 j m t w 0 j t combining 14 with the fact that sm lies in j des w 0 j by 15 this means that t m hmin t m 1 t m 1 9 proof of theorem 1 1 thinking of each monotone triangle t i as corresponding to a facet we identify it with its subset of n 1 vertices namely t i t i 0 t i 1 t i n 1 t i n n shellability as defined in the introduction requires that for each pair i j with 1 i j n we must exhibit some k j satisfying t k t j n including and n and t i t j t k t j given i j let j m t i m 6 t j m we claim that t j m 6 t j for at least one m in j otherwise proposition 4 1 implies the two equalities here t j t j w 0 j t i w 0 j w t i but then the inequality t j w t i would contradict i j given such an m one checks that the index k defined by t j m t k does the job t k t j m w t j implies that k j t k t j t j m t j n 1 since t j m 6 t j t i t j t k t j because sm lies in j we close this section with two remarks about the above shelling remark 4 2 since the i operators on mtn restrict to the usual bubble sorting operators on the symmetric group sn embedded inside mtn via w 7 t w one finds that the subposet sn w is actually an order ideal inside mtn w it is even the principal order ideal below t w 0 where w 0 n n 1 2 1 as a consequence it is possible to pick a linear extension of w on mtn which contains all of the elements of the order ideal sn as an initial segment this then gives a shelling order on the facets of n 0 1 which shells the coxeter complex 2 n 0 1 first before continuing on to shell the remaining facets of n 0 1 that do not correspond to permutations remark 4 3 shellability implies that the n 2 dimensional simplicial complex n 0 1 has the homotopy type of a bouquet of n 2 spheres the coxeter complex 2 n 0 1 inside it is homeomorphic to a single n 2 sphere and this sphere has well known easy embeddings into rn 1 for example it is isomorphic to the barycentric subdivision of the boundary of a simplex with vertex set 1 2 n alternatively one can embed it within the hyperplane x 1 xn 0 inside r n by extending piecewise linearly the map that sends its vertices to the sn images of the fundamental dominant weights of type an 1 the vertex indexed by a subset i with i n is sent to the vector i i ei i n e 1 en where ei is the i th standard basis vector of rn after looking at the picture 3 of 3 0 1 which embeds it in r 2 one might wonder whether n 0 1 embeds in some simple way into r n 1 we are doubtful for example when n 4 one can check that if one takes either of the two vertex coordinates for embedding 2 4 0 1 into r 3 as described in the previous paragaph when one extends this piecewise linearly over the extra simplices in 4 0 1 it leads to self intersections and not an embedding 5 el labeling and proof of theorem 1 2 recall the statement of the theorem theorem 1 2 there is a partial order on altn so that the edge labeling which assigns i j 1 j 1 i in altn becomes an el labeling of n furthermore any of the el shelling orders associated with this el labeling is a linear order on mtn which extends the weak order w we will define the partial order on altn via its identification with a boolean algebra 2 n 1 note that a vector v in 0 1 n lies in altn exactly when each of its tail sums v 1 i n vi vi 1 vn lies in 0 1 with n i 1 vi 1 the following proposition is straightforward to verify 10 proposition 5 1 one has mutually inverse bijections altn 2 n 1 v 7 s v i n 1 v 1 i 1 n 1 e 1 i s ei 1 ei 1 7 s definition 5 2 put a partial order el on altn that pulls back the inclusion order on 2 n 1 via the above bijection that is v el w if and only if s v s w equivalently v el w if and only for every i 1 2 n one has dot product w v ei ei 1 en 0 example 5 3 here is the order el on altn for n 3 4 5 next we show that c n altn defined by i j 1 j 1 i is an el labeling of n with respect to el on altn for the rest of this section fix a pair i lace j in n with hmin i j as in definition 2 5 lemma 5 4 assume i lace h lace j with h i 1 then 1 hmin i j 1 i el 1 h 1 i proof recall el can be rephrased as follows a el b if and only if 1 b 1 a 1 n 0 for all thus since hmin i j comp h according to lemma 2 6 iii for all one will have 1 h 1 i 1 hmin i j 1 i 1 n 1 h 1 hmin i j 1 n 0 it turns out that one can characterize hmin i j in terms of el lemma 5 5 assume i lace h lace j with j i 2 then 1 h 1 i el 1 j 1 k if and only if h hmin i j proof name the elements of i h j as follows i i 1 ip h h 1 hp hp 1 j j 1 jp jp 1 jp 2 assume h hmin i j we check for each that 1 h 1 i 1 n 1 j 1 h 1 n or equivalently j n i n 2 h n 0 11 if h n this is clear otherwise let h n hk hk 1 hp 1 so that h n p 2 k then the interlacing i lace h lace j along with hk max ik 1 jk imply that i n ik ik 1 ip if hk ik 1 ik 1 ik ik 1 ip if hk ik 1 j n jk 1 jk 2 ip 1 if hk jk jk jk 1 jk 2 jp 2 if hk jk from this one can calculate that j n i n 2 h n 0 if hk jk ik 1 or hk ik 1 jk 1 if hk ik 1 jk assume 1 h 1 i el 1 j 1 h claim one cannot have both strict inequalities ik 1 hk ik nor a strict inequality ip hp 1 to see this claim note that in either case ik 1 hk ik or ip hp 1 it would imply hk h i then since i lace h this would imply 1 h 1 i 1 hk n 1 but then hk h and h lace j implies 1 j 1 h 1 hk n 0 1 1 h 1 i 1 hk n a contradiction to our assumption by lemma 2 8 c and d i lace h lace j implies hk max ik 1 jk for k 1 2 p 1 we must now show that these are all equalities not inequalities for the sake of contradiction assume not and pick k maximal such that hk max ik 1 jk the claim above then forces k p and hk ik else ik 1 hk ik or k p 1 and ip hp 1 then hk 1 hk ik and the maximality of k forces hk 1 max ik jk 1 max hk jk 1 jk 1 and again the claim forces k 1 p and ik 1 hk 1 jk 1 we now repeat this argument to show by induction that for all m k 1 k 2 one has both m p and this triple coincidence jm hm im this would contradict finiteness of p the inductive step again notes that hm 1 hm im and maximality of k forces hm 1 max im jm 1 max hm jm 1 jm 1 but then the claim forces m 1 p and im 1 hm 1 jm 1 recreating the inductive hypothesis proof of theorem 1 2 we first check our edge labeling satisfies the two conditions for an el labeling for every interval x y n there is a unique maximal chain x x 0 x 1 xk y that has weakly rising labels x 0 x 1 x 1 x 2 xk 1 xxk if x z y with z 6 x 1 then x x 1 x z the first condition follows by combining lemma 2 8 b and lemma 5 5 which show that for any i lace j the unique maximal chain in the interval i j corresponds to the i j monotone trapezoid tmin i j then the second condition comes from lemma 5 4 for the second assertion of the theorem it suffices to check that if t t are monotone triangles with t w t then any of the above el shellings which come from linearly extending the lexicographic ordering of el on edge labels will have t earlier than t by definition of the weak order w it suffices to check this holds when t t i for some i in this case it follows because lemma 5 4 shows that t will have lexicographically earlier edge label sequence than t the two sequences first differ in replacing the label 1 ti 1 1 ti with the el smaller label 1 hmin ti ti 2 1 ti 6 descents h vectors and flag h vectors recall from the introduction the usual descent set for a permutation w w 1 wn in sn des w k n 1 wk wk 1 k n 1 w k wsk w w it has a natural extension to monotone triangles t motivated by the weak order w and our shelling results 12 definition 6 1 define the descent set des t for t t 0 t 1 tn in mtn by des t k n 1 t k w t k n 1 tk 6 hmin tk 1 tk 1 there is another way to define des t lemma 6 2 for t in mtn one has des t k n 1 there does not exist some t 6 t with t k t in particular t is one of the maximal elements of the weak order w if and only if des t n 1 proof since 2 k k if there exists t with t k t then t k t t k t so k 6 des t conversely if k 6 des t so that t k t we wish to exhibit at least one t 6 t having k t t from t k t t 0 t 1 tn we know that tk hmin i j where i tk 1 j tk 1 so that if we construct t from t by replacing tk with hmax i j as defined in 8 then it will certainly have t k t it only remains to show that t 6 t that is hmax i j 6 hmin i j to check this name elements i i 1 i 2 ik 1 hmin i j h 1 h 2 hk 1 hk hmax i j h 1 h 2 h k 1 h k j j 1 j 2 jk 1 jk jk 1 then the formulas defining hmin i j hmax i j are hm max im 1 jm h m min im jm 1 implying that h m hm if and only if im jm or im 1 jm 1 since i j i k 1 such an equality occurs at most k 1 times and hence h m 6 hm for at least one m 1 2 k remark 6 3 embedded in the previous proof are operators k t 7 t on mtn for k 1 2 n 1 where t is obtained from t by replacing tk with t k hmax tk 1 tk 1 because of the relation between the hmin and hmax constructions described in remark 2 7 the operators k k 1 2 n 1 satisfy the same braid and quadratic relations as k giving a different action of the 0 hecke monoid hn 0 on mtn one can check that this other action in fact extends the right regular action of hn 0 on itself when one identifies the monotone triangle t w in mtn with w in hn 0 one could use it to define a different version of a weak order on mtn having a unique top element t w 0 but several different minimal elements one reason that we instead chose the action by k and their resulting weak order w is so that the monotone triangle t e corresponding to e 1 2 n in sn labels the first facet in all of the shellings as mentioned in the introduction descent sets conveniently encode the flag f vector f n fj j n 1 where fj counts the number of chains that pass through the ranks in j one instead considers the flag h vector h n hj j n 1 defined by these inclusion exclusion relations fj i i j hi or equivalently hj i i j 1 j ifi general shelling theory e g bjo rner 3 1 b then implies this combinatorial interpretation for hj hj n t mtn des t j the usual f vector f f 1 f 0 f 1 fn 2 and h vector h h 0 h 1 hn 1 for n 0 1 can then be obtained by grouping the terms in fj hj as follows fi j n 1 i 1 fj and hi j n 1 i hj 13 n h n h 0 h 1 hn 1 2 1 1 3 1 4 2 4 1 11 21 9 5 1 26 130 192 80 6 1 57 638 2318

and flag h polynomial for small values of n we remark on some features of this data note the sequence of values 1 2 9 80 1321 39026 2016716 for hn 1 t mtn des t n 1 maximal elements in the poset mtn w appearing at the right in table 1 which is not in the online encyclopedia of integer sequences oeis the data invites comparison with the boolean algebra 2 n which has h vector h 2 n h 0 h 1 hn 1 given by the eulerian numbers that is hi 2 n w sn des w i the eulerian numbers are well behaved in many ways see petersen 14 for example they satisfy recurrences and have the symmetry hi hn 1 i they also have the very strong property that the h polynomial h 2 n t n 1 i 0 hit i w sn t des w has only real zeroes this implies log concavity h 2 i hi 1 hi 1 which then implies unimodality meaning that there is some k in this case k n 1 2 works for which h 0 h 1 hk hn 2 hn 1 from the data in table 1 the reader can check that for n the h polynomial h n t n 1 i 0 hit i t mtn t des t is irreducible in q t with only real zeroes for n 8 hence is log concave for those values question 6 4 does h n t have only real zeroes if not is its coefficient sequence log concave or at least unimodal 14 question 6 5 what is the largest entry in the h vector of n is it always hn 2 7 descents as a map to qsym and proof of theorem 1 3 as described in the introduction the map w 7 des w that sends a permutation w insn to its descent set was pleasingly reinterpreted in the work of malvenuto and reutenauer 11 as a morphism of hopf algebras we wish to explain here how this extends to the map t 7 des t sending a monotone triangle to its descent set giving at least an algebra but not coalgebra morphism out of the hopf algebra of asms recently defined by cheballah giraudo and maurice 8 let us start by recalling the algebra structures on quasisymmetric functions permutations and asms definition 7 1 the ring of quasisymmetric functions qsym can be defined as the subalgebra of the algebra z x 1 x 2 of formal power series that has z basis given by the monomial quasisymmetric functions m 1 i 1 i 2 ik x 1 i 1 x kik as 1 k runs through all ordered compositions having i 1 2 and any length k 0 the ring qsym was introduced by gessel 9 he observed that if one defines the unitriangularly related z basis of fundamental quasisymmetric functions 16 l coarsens m then results from stanley s theory of p partitions 16 cor 7 19 5 imply the following expansion for products of l s given a subset j j 1 j n 1 define its associated composition of n to be j j 1 j 2 j 1 j 3 j 2 j j 1 n j in other words j is the composition whose partial sums are the elements of j for u v in sa sb let u v a be the set of all shuffles w w 1 w 2 wa b of the sequences u u 1 ua and v a a v 1 a v 2 a vb in other words w sa b is in u v a if u 1 ua and a v 1 a vb are subsequences of w proposition 7 2 given u v in sa sb 17 l des u l des v w u v a l des w this was part of malvenuto and reutenauer s motivation for the following definition definition 7 3 the malvenuto reutenauer hopf algebra of permutations is a graded free abelian group fqsym n 0 fqsymn in which fqsymn has z basis elements w w sn as an algebra its multiplication is extended z linearly from this rule for u v in sa sb 18 u v w u v a w in which the sum runs over the same set of w as in 17 thus the algebra structure on fqsym was defined so that this map is a surjective algebra morphism 19 fqsym qsym w 7 l des w 15 definition 7 4 cheballah giraudo and maurice 8 embedded fqsym inside a larger graded hopf algebra 20 asm n 0 asmn whose nth graded component asmn has a z basis a indexed by a in asmn its algebra structure generalizes that of fqsym to the following row shuffle 1 product given asms a b of sizes a a and b b define a b to be the a a b matrix with first a columns a and last b columns all 0 vectors likewise a b is the b a b matrix with last b columns b and first a columns all 0 vectors then define 21 a b c a b a b c where c runs through all the a b a b matrices obtained by shuffling the rows of a b and of a b example 7 5 if a 0 0 0 0 and b 0 0 then a b 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 and a b 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 one then has a b 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 note that when one restricts the product formula 21 to the elements of the form w a w where a w is the permutation matrix corresponding to w 1 it agrees with the multiplication rule for u v given in 18 we also wish to recast the formula 21 in terms of monotone triangles the following proposition is straightforward using the bijection asmn mtn described in the introduction proposition 7 6 fix a b in asma asmb with corresponding monotone triangles t a t b in mta mtb let c in a b a b have s a b the a element subset indexing the rows of c that come from a b and a b s the b element subset indexing the rows of c that come from a b then t c in mta b has as its k th row the set t c k t a i a t b j where i s k and j a b s k k i example 7 7 for a 0 0 0 0 and b 0 0 as in example 7 5 one has t a 2 1 3 1 2 3 and a t b 5 4 5 hence the terms c appearing in the product a b correspond to these monotone triangles t c 1 actually in 8 the algebra structure uses column shuffles but this is equivalent to what is described here after transposing the alternating sign matrices a 7 at 16 s 1 2 3 1 2 4 1 2 5 1 3 4 1 3 5 t c 2 1 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 5 2 1 3 1 3 5 1 2 3 5 2 1 3 1 3 5 1 3 4 5 5 2 5 1 3 5 1 2 3 5 5 2 5 1 3 5 1 3 4 5 s 1 4 5 2 3 4 2 3 5 2 4 5 3

algebra but not a coalgebra morphism asm fqsym a 7 l des a where des a des t a for a in asmn is the descent set of its monotone triangle t a proof of theorem 1 3 given a b in asma asmb we claim that the multiset of descent sets des t c as c runs through the elements of a b a b depends only upon the descent sets des t a des t b not on a b themselves assuming this claim for the moment one finishes the proof by picking arbitrary u v in sa sb having des u des t a and des v des t b and calculating a b c a b a b l des t c w u v l des w l des u l des v l des a l des b a b here the second equality used the claim while the third equality used 19 to prove the claim note that each c in a b a b is determined by the a subset s a b indexing the rows of c that come from a b we give rules in cases below that decide whether some k a b 1 lies in des t c based only on the subset s and the descent sets des t a and des t b not on a b themselves as notation let i s k 1 j a b s k 1 and name these elements t a i 2 a 1 ai ai 1 ai 2 a t b j 2 b 1 bj bj 1 bj 2 note that deciding whether k lies in des t c simply means checking whether any of the entries of t k where t t c k k hmin t c k 1 t c k 1 differs from the corresponding entry of t c k when computed via the formula 7 as the maximum of its two neighboring entries to the northwest and southwest case 1 both k k 1 lie in s in this case proposition 7 6 implies that t c k 1 t c k t c k 1 look like this a 1 ai b 1 bj a 1 ai ai 1 b 1 bj a 1 ai ai 1 ai 2 b 1 bj each of the entries bm in t c k equals its northwest neighbor so is unchanged in t c k this implies that k des t c if and only if k des t a 17 case 2 both k k 1 lie in a b s here t c k 1 t c k t c k 1 look like this a 1 ai b 1 bj a 1 ai b 1 bj bj 1 a 1 ai b 1 bj bj 1 bj 2 similarly to case 1 each entry am in t c k equals its southwest neighbor so is unchanged in t c k this implies k des t c if and only if k des t b case 3 k lies in s but k 1 lies in a b s here t c k 1 t c k t c k 1 look like this a 1 ai b 1 bj a 1 ai ai 1 b 1 bj a 1 ai ai 1 b 1 bj bj 1 we claim that in this case k 6 des t c since each entry am of t c k equals its southwest neighbor while each entry bm of t c k equals its northwest neighbor case 4 k 1 lies in s but k lies in a b s here t c k 1 t c k t c k 1 look like this a 1 ai b 1 bj a 1 ai b 1 bj bj 1 a 1 ai ai 1 b 1 bj bj 1 in this case k des t c since the entry b 1 of t c k has b 1 a max ai ai 1 to see that a 7 l des a is not a coalgebra morphism for example one can check from the coproduct formula of cheballah giraudo and maurice 8 1 3 5 that the alternating sign matrix a 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 has coproduct a 1 a a 1 that is a is primitive meanwhile its image a l 1 1 1 has a l 1 1 1 1 l 1 1 1 l 1 l 1 1 l 1 1 l 1 l 1 1 1 1 which is not the same as a 1 l 1 1 1 l 1 1 1 1 that is a is not primitive remark 7 8 it is well known and not hard to see e g as a special case of 16 thm 7 19 7 that applying to the sum of all of the basis elements w w sn for fqsymn gives a readily identifiable symmetric function w sn w w sn l des w x 1 x 2 n this fails for asmn e g the data in table 1 for n 4 together with 16 shows that a asmn a a asm 4 l des t a l 4 3 l 1 3 5 l 2 2 3 l 3 1 7 l 1 1 2 7 l 1 2 1 7 l 2 1 1 9 l 1 1 1 1 m 4 4 m 1 3 6 m 2 2 4 m 3 1 16 m 1 1 2 14 m 1 2 1 16 m 2 1 1 42 m 1 1 1 1 which is not a symmetric function because its coefficient on m is not constant for all compositions within the same rearrangement class it would be interesting to find natural subcollections a of asmn not contained entirely in sn for which a a is a symmetric function 18 3 2 3 1 3 4 1 3 2 2 2 3 1 3 4 2 3 3 1 3 1 3 4 3 1 3 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 ww 2 1 3 1 3 4 3 1 3 1 3 1 2 3 1 1 1 3 1 3 4 3 2 1 3 1 2 3 1 2 2 2 3 1 2 3 2 1 1 3 1 2 3 2 2 1 2 1 2 3 1 1 1 2

lattice and a subinterval within it 8 poset properties of weak order on mtn the weak order w on the symmetric group sn has many pleasant poset theoretic properties it has bottom and top elements 0 e 1 2 n 1 n and 1 w 0 n n 1 2 1 it is a lattice it is ranked with rank function given by the cardinality inv w of the left inversion set of w inv w wj wi 1 i j n and wi wj it has an encoding via inclusion of these left inversion sets u w v if and only if inv u inv v the mo bius function u v for u w v only takes on values in 0 1 1 more precisely the homotopy type of the order complex u v of any of its open intervals u v is contractible or homotopy spherical specifically one can phrase this in terms of hn 0 action on sn as follows u v is contractible unless u v w 0 j for some subset j des u in which case u v is homotopy equivalent to a j 2 dimensional sphere see bjo rner 2 theorem 6 only a few of these properties extend to the weak order w to mtn it is still true that mtn w has a bottom element 0 t e 1 1 2 1 2 3 n but it no longer has a top element 1 as there are many maximal elements since mtn is finite and has no top element it cannot be a lattice but it is also true that its intervals fail to be lattices for example the lower interval shown on the left in figure 1 is not a lattice because for example 1 1 3 1 2 3 and 2 1 2 1 2 3 do not have a least upper bound since both 2 1 3 1 2 3 and 3 2 3 1 2 3 are minimal upper bounds note that this same lower interval is not ranked since there are maximal chains of lengths four and five alternating sign matrices a aij have a well established inversion number inv a i k j aijak introduced by mills robbins and rumsey 12 p 344 which generalizes the rank function inv w for 19 sn w of permutations however it is not clear that it relates to chains in the weak order mtn w for example one might hope that the length of the shortest saturated chain from 0 to t in weak order might correspond to the inversion number of the alternating sign matrix of t however roger behrend noted that this fails for the first time in mt 4 where one can check that t 3 2 4 1 3 4 a 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 inv a 5 but the shortest saturated chain from 0 to t has length 4 additionally in mt 5 one can check that t 3 3 4 1 4 5 1 2 4 5 a 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 inv a 5 but all saturated chains in the weak order from 0 to t have length at least 6 question 8 1 is there a generalization of the notion of the left inversion set inv w for permutations to an inversion set inv t for monotone triangles encoding the weak order mtn w via inclusion that is t w t if and only if inv t inv t in spite of some of the above shortcomings the mo bius function and homotopy type of open intervals in mtn w may be just as simple to describe as for weak order on sn conjecture 8 2 for two monotone triangles t w t the order complex t t of their open interval in w is contractible unless t t w 0 j for some j des t namely j m t m 6 tm in which case t t is homotopy equivalent to a j 2 dimensional sphere conjecture 8 2 would imply that t t 0 in the contractible case and 1 j when t t w 0 j example 8 3 an interesting example is the non lattice lower interval 0 y on the left in figure 1 which has the order complex 0 y of its open interval homotopy equivalent to a 1 sphere circle meanwhile its subinterval x y shown to its right has x y contractible references 1 a
