10851 v 1 preliminary definitions let f x be a smooth function over some domain d define the operator r as follows f r x x d dx r f x r n 0 1 please notice that this definition uses square brackets differing from the familiar notation f r x which involves round brackets and indicates the rth derivative of f x define the elementary functions g h c 0 c g x 1 2 x x 1 h x 1 2 x x 1 2 from 1 it follows immediately g 1 x h x h 1 x g x 3 zeros of g and h are g i 0 h 1 0 g i 0 h 1 0 4 here i denotes the imaginary unit based on 2 define the functions gs j c 0 1 1 i i c gs j g s j hj s 0 j z 5 the domain of gs j in general excludes 0 1 1 i i because if j 0 the zeros of h 4 cause poles wikf of gs j and so do the zeros of g in case j s for each given s 0 the infinite set of functions gs gs 2 gs 1 gs 0 gs 1 gs 2 s 0 6 are linearly independent the reason is that for each j z gs j has unique orders of zeros poles for example by definition 5 x 1 is a zero of order j if j 0 and a pole of order j if j 0 therefore no finite linear combination of other elements in gs can reproduce the same order j of the zero pole at x 1 the triangular array a application of the r operator with r 1 to gs j as defined in 5 yields g 1 s j j gs j 1 s j gs j 1 s 0 j z 7 2 this suggests the expansion g r s 0 j z as r j gs j s r 0 8 applying r 1 to 8 leads to a recurrence relation for the coefficients here are the steps in detail g r 1 s 0 j z as r j g 1 s j j z as r j j gs j 1 j z as r j s j gs j 1 j z as r j 1 j 1 gs j j z as r j 1 s j 1 gs j 9 10 a follows if one compares this with 8 after having replaced r r 1 and when observing linear independence of 6 as r 1 j as r j 1 s j 1 as r j 1 j 1 j z s r 0 10 a as 0 0 1 10 b as r j 0 if not 0 j r 10 c initial or seed values 10 b 10 c make as r j a triangular array wike we can therefore write 8 as a finite sum g r s 0 r j 0 as r j gs j s r 0 11 the coefficients in 7 add up to j s j s by induction this is readily extended to the identity r j 0 as r j s r s r 0 12 table 1 displays a few elements from the tip of as r j as computed from 10 a here the s k denote falling factorials wikb the elements of a are integer functions of the size parameter s 0 in particular elements in the j 0 column can be expressed in terms of cosh 15 at the same time for any given r 0 the rth item in the j 0 column equals the rth moment of a centered binomial distribution of size s 20 coefficients of s k in the j 0 column match the triangle of numbers given in int when selecting only even values of r 3 j 0 1 2 3 4 r 0 1 1 0 s 2 s 0 s 2 3 0 3 s 2 s 0 s 3 4 3 s 2 s 0 6 s 3 4 s 2 0 s 4 5 0 15 s 3 15 s 2 s 0 10 s 4 10 s 3 0 6 15 s 3 15 s 2 s 0 45 s 4 75 s 3 16 s 2 0 7 0 105 s 4 210 s 3 63 s 2 s 8 105 s 4 210 s 3 63 s 2 s 9 0 table 1 apex of as r j relation to hyperbolic functions exactly the same table is generated if one replaces g h from 2 by cosh sinh wikc and at the same time replaces the r operator from 1 by the rth derivative r g cosh h sinh r r 13 with these replacements 11 becomes cosh t s r r j 0 as r j cosh t s j sinh t j s r 0 14 and therefore setting the formal parameter t 0 as r 0 cosh t s r t 0 s r 0 15 relation to centered binomial distribution gs 0 as defined in 5 if written as the laurent series gs 0 x j z bs j x j s 0 16 generates a centered binomial distribution wika for if we define the set of events vs 2 k s 0 k s s 0 17 4 each event v vs is associated with bs v from 16 which can be written as bs v 1 2 s s v s 2 v vs s 0 18 according to e g bul 79 the moment generating function ms t is defined by the expected value of et v ms t s k 0 1 2 s s k et 2 k s cosh t s s 0 19 therefore if s r denotes the r th moment of 18 and m r s denotes the r th derivative of ms t with respect to the formal parameter t we have s r m r s 0 cosh t s r t 0 s r 0 20 on the other hand by construction of g r s 0 we have the identity s r g r s 0 1 r j 0 as r j gs j 1 as r 0 s r 0 21 comparing 20 and 21 again gives 15 the condensed form b in order to exclude the intermediate zero elements in table 1 we derive from a the con densed form bs r n as r r 2 n n z s r 0 22 transcribing 10 a 10 b 10 c and 12 in terms of 22 gives bs r 1 n bs r n s r 2 n bs r n 1 r 2 n 1 s r 0 23 a bs 0 0 1 23 b bs r n 0 if not 0 n r 2 23 c r 2 n 0 bs r n s r s r 0 24 5 the triangular field expansion in terms of falling factorials consider the transformation bs r n 0 k j n s r n j r 2 n k n j k s r 0 n z 25 if one inserts 25 into 23 a while applying appropriate identities to match factorial powers wikb of s and r on both sides one gets the recurrence relation 2 n k n j k n j 1 n j 1 k 1 k 1 n 1 j k 1 n 1 j k 0 k j n 26 a 0 0 0 1 26 b n j k 0 if not 0 k j n 26 c seed values 26 b 26 c which are counterparts of conditions 23 b 23 c make a triangular array in 3 dimensions for given n 0 n j k can be regarded as a lower triangular matrix of dimension n 1 indices j and k denote row and column indices respectively the matrix associated with n 0 reduces to the scalar 1 special solutions some special solutions of the triple 26 b 26 c 26 a are easily verified n k k 1 2 n n k k 3 k n k 0 27 a n n 1 0 1 2 n n n 1 1 2 n 1 n 1 27 b n n 0 n 0 n z 27 c from 27 a we have in particular n 0 0 1 2 n n n n n 1 6 n n n 0 28 6 relation to stirling numbers inserting 25 into 24 gives after rearrangement r i 0 s r i j 0 r j n 0 n i n j 2 n sr s r 0 29 comparing this with the basic relation for stirling numbers 2 nd kind wikd r i 0 s r i r r i sr s r 0 30 we get the identity j 0 r j n 0 n i n j 2 n r r i 0 i r 31 relation to hyperbolic functions if one substitutes r 2 n in 25 one gets bs 2 n n 0 k j n s n j 2 n 2 n k n j k 2 n 2 n 0 j n s n j n j 0 s n 0 32 and therefore from 22 and 15 0 j n s n j n j 0 1 2 n cosh t s 2 n t 0 s n 0 33 the adjoint form it is useful to introduce the adjoint form n k n n k k k z n 0 34 rewriting 26 a 26 b 26 c in terms of gives 2 n k n k k 1 n k 1 k 1 n 1 k 1 n 1 1 k 0 k n 35 a 7 0 0 0 1 35 b n k 0 if not 0 k n 35 c the modifier in 34 can be viewed as a mapping which turns the lower triangular matrix n into the lower triangular matrix n in that sense it is an involution n n n 0 36 1 0 1 2 1 n n 1 1 0 1 2 n n n n 0 n 1 n 1 n 2 n 2 n 1 1 2 n n 1 n n 0 1 2 n 1 n 1 6 n n n 1 table 2 triangular field n j k n k table 2 illustrates the triangular shape of n j k n k row and column indices j and k run over all integers z the blue area which extends in all directions marks zero elements the diagonals of n j k form the rows of the adjoint field n k 34 and vice versa by involution 36 the diagonals of n k form the rows of n j k special solutions 28 27 b and 27 c have been inserted 8 the generating functions fn based upon the adjoint quantities 34 define the functions fn z k z n k z k n z 37 here z is a formal parameter if f n denotes the derivative of 37 with respect to z we have f n z k z k n n k k z k 1 n z 38 if one multiplies 35 a by zk performs summation over all k z matches powers of z on both sides and replaces 37 and 38 one gets the recursive differential equation 2 n z fn z z z 1 f n z fn 1 1 z f n 1 z n 0 39 a f 0 0 1 39 b fn 0 if not n 0 39 c with boundary conditions 39 b and 39 c being direct consequences of the corresponding properties 35 b and 35 c of a distinctive special value is fn 0 n 0 n n 0 n z 40 frequency representation of integer partitions the solution 43 of 39 a involves integer partitions in frequency representation and 98 let pn denote the set of integer partitions of n 0 with a given number 0 of parts as 64 let pn be a partition of n with parts then k denotes the frequency of part k 1 in this implies the identities n n k 1 k k 41 a n k 1 k 41 b in the degenerate case 0 we have pn 0 empty partition if n 0 if n 0 42 42 means that n 0 has exactly one partition namely the empty partition without parts and on the other hand clearly there is no partition of n 0 without parts 9 solution of 39 a 39 b the recursive differential equation 39 a including boundary condition 39 b is solved by fn z pn n k 1 1 k fk z k n 0 43 the component functions fk being defined as fk z 1 2 k 1 z 2 k 1 k 0 44 setting z 0 in 43 while using 40 gives n n 0 pn n k 1 k 2 k k 1 n 0 45 for 0 this reduces to 27 c and for n to the first part of 28 proof that 43 solves 39 a 39 b the proof is divided into three sections first get rid of the recursiveness in 39 a by forming power series over the whole range of the indices and n this leads to the linear partial differential equation 50 a including boundary condition 50 b second solve 50 a 50 b and third focus on specific powers of x and y in the representation of solution 51 as an infinite product of infinite sums 52 summation over z starting from 37 define the functions fn y z z fn z y n z 46 here y and z are formal parameters if one multiplies 39 a by y performs summation over all z matches powers of y and z on both sides and replaces 46 or their partial derivatives one gets the recursive partial differential equation 2 nfn y z z z 1 zfn y z z y yfn y z y fn 1 y z zfn 1 y z n 0 47 a f 0 1 47 b 10 fn 0 n 0 47 c with boundary conditions 47 b and 47 c again being direct consequences of the correspond ing properties 39 b and 39 c a distinctive special value here is fn 0 0 fn 0 0 n 0 0 n n 0 n 0 n z 48 here we have made use of 40 and 27 c summation over n z next in a quite analogous manner define the function f x y z n z fn y z x n 49 where fn has been declared in 46 again x y and z are formal parameters if one multiplies 47 a by xn performs summation over all n z matches powers of x y and z on both sides and replaces 49 or their partial derivatives one gets the linear partial differential equation 2 x xf x y z z z 1 zf x y z z y yf x y z y xf x y z x zf x y z 50 a f 0 0 0 f 0 0 0 1 50 b with boundary condition 50 b derived from 48 solution of 50 a the linear partial differential equation 50 a including boundary condition 50 b is solved by f x y z exp y k 1 fk z x k 51 where fk is from 44 this is verified by insertion result 43 becomes clear if one writes down 51 as an infinite product of infinite sums as illustrated in 52 here each row represents an infinite sum 1 y f 1 z x 1 1 1 2 y 2 f 21 z x 1 2 1 3 y 3 f 31 z x 1 3 1 y f 2 z x 2 1 1 2 y 2 f 22 z x 2 2 1 3 y 3 f 32 z x 2 3 1 y f 3 z x 3 1 1 2 y 2 f 23 z x 3 2 1 3 y 3 f 33 z x 3 3 52 11 43 follows for any given pair n 0 if upon multiplication of all rows one combines all coefficients of xn and at the same time all coefficients of y summary starting from the pair of elementary functions 2 the triangular array a see
