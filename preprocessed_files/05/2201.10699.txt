lemma states that in a bipartite graph an average vertex weighted by its degree has the property that almost all small subsets s in its neighborhood has common neighborhood almost as large as in the random graph of the same edge density two well known applications of the lemma are as follows the first is a theorem of fu redi 12 and of alon krivelevich and sudakov 2 showing that the maximum number of edges in an n vertex graph not containing a fixed bipartite graph with maximum degree at most r on one side is o n 2 1 r this was recently extended by grzesik janzer and nagy 14 to the family of so called r t blowups of a tree a second application is a theorem of conlon fox and sudakov 5 confirming a special case of a conjecture of erdo s and simonovits and of sidorenko showing that if h is a bipartite graph that contains a vertex complete to the other part and g is a graph then the probability that the uniform random mapping from v h to v g is a homomorphism is at least 2 e g v g 2 e h in this note we introduce a nested variant of the dependent random choice lemma which might be of independent interest we then apply it to obtain a common extension of the theorem of conlon fox and sudakov and the theorem of grzesik janzer and nagy regarding tura n and sidorenko properties of so called tree degenerate graphs 1 introduction given a graph g let g denote its number of vertices a homomorphism from a graph h to a graph g is a mapping f v h v g such that for each edge uv in h f u f v is an edge in g let hh g denote the number of homomorphisms from h to g and th g hh g g h thus th g represents the fraction of mappings from v h to v g that are homomorphisms viewed probabilistically th g is the probability that the uniform random mapping from v h to v g is a homomorphism a beautiful conjecture of sidorenko 22 is as follows conjecture 1 1 sidorenko 21 for every bipartite graph h and every graph g th g tk 2 g e h department of mathematics miami university oxford oh 45056

partially supported by national science foundation grant dms 1855542 1 http arxiv org abs 2201 10699 v 1 since tk 2 g e h 2 e g n 2 e h one may view sidorenko s conjecture as saying that the number of homomorphic copies of h in an n vertex graph g is asymptotically at least as large as in the n vertex random graph with the same edge density the following lemma based on tensor products see remark 2 in the english version of 21 for instance is commonly known and is used in many earlier papers see 1 5 18 for instance it reduces the conjecture to a slightly weaker statement lemma 1 2 21 let h be a bipartite graph if there exists a positive constant c depending only on h such that for all graphs g th g c tk 2 g e h holds then for all g th g tk 2 g e h when the edge density of g is sufficiently high it is expected that many of the homomorphisms from h to g are injective erdo s and simonovits 10 made several conjectures regarding the number of injective homomorphisms as usual let ex n h denote the tura n number of h which is the maximum number of edges in an n vertex graph not containing h let h h g denote the number of injective homomorphisms from h to g and let t h g h h g g h the first conjecture of erdo s and simonovits from 10 states that for every c 0 there is a c 0 such that if e g 1 c ex n h then t h g c tk 2 g e h the second weaker conjecture from 10 says if ex n h o n 2 then there exist constants 0 c c 0 such that if e g cn 2 then t h g c tk 2 g e h it is known see 21 that this weaker version is equivalent to sidorenko s conjecture however compared to the stronger conjecture of erdo s and simonovits sidorenko s conjecture does not give an explicit sharp edge density threshold on when to guarantee the stated number of injective homomorphisms there is yet another version of the erdo s simonovits conjecture given in 19 that is equivalent to saying that there exist two constants c c 0 such that if g is an n vertex graph g with e g c ex n h then t h g c tk 2 g e h sidorenko 22 verified his own conjecture when h is a complete bipartite graph an even cycle a tree or a bipartite graph with at most four vertices on one side hatami 15 proved that hypercubes satisfy sidorenko s conjecture by developing a concept of norming graphs the first major progress on sidorenko s conjecture was made by conlon fox and sudakov 5 who used the celebrated dependent random choice method see 11 for a survey to show theorem 1 3 conlon fox sudakov 5 if h is a bipartite graph with m edges which has a vertex complete to the other part then h satisfies sidorenko s conjecture in fact conlon fox and sudakov proved the stronger theorem that h contains a vertex complete to the other part and the minimum degree in the first part is at least d then th g tkr d g m rd from theorem 1 3 conlon fox and sudakov 5 also deduced an approximate version of sidorenko s conjecture since the work of conlon fox and sudakov there has been a lot of further progress on sidorenko s conjecture li and szegedy 20 used entropy method presented in the form of logarithmic convexity inequalities to the extend the result of conlon fox and sudakov to a more general family of graphsh which they refer to as reflection trees these ideas were further developed by kim lee and lee 18 who proved the conjecture for what they called tree arrangeable graphs and showed that if t is a tree and h is a bipartite graph that satisfies sidorenko s conjecture then the cartesian product of t and h also satisfies sidorenko s conjecture subsequently conlon kim lee and lee 6 7 and independently szegedy 23 established more families of bipartite graphsh for 2 which sidorenko s conjecture holds these include bipartite graphs that admit a certain type of tree decomposition subdivisions of certain graphs including cliques and certain cartesian products and etc more recently conlon and lee 8 showed that sidorenko s conjecture holds for any bipartite graph h with a bipartition a b where the number of vertices in b of degree k satisfies a certain divisibility condition for each k as a corollary for every bipartite graph h with a bipartition a b there is a positive integer p such that the blowup h p a formed by taking p vertex disjoint copies of h and gluing all copies of a along corresponding vertices satisfies sidorenko s conjecture another line of work that motivates our result is related to a long standing conjecture of erdo s regarding the tura n number of so called r degenerate graphs given a positive integer r a graph h is r degenerate if its vertices can be linearly ordered such that each vertex has back degree at most r conjecture 1 4 erdo s 9 let r be a fixed positive integer let h be any r degenerate bipartite graph then ex n h o n 2 1 r the first major progress on conjecture 1 4 was the following theorem which was first obtained by fu redi 12 in an implicit form and then later reproved by alon krivelevich and sudakov 2 using the dependent random choice method theorem 1 5 fu redi 12 alon krivelevich sudakov 2 let r be a positive integer let h be a bipartite graph with maximum degree at most r on one side then ex n h o n 2 1 r the family of graphs satisfying the condition of theorem 1 5 forms a very special family of r degenerate bipartite graphs which we will refer to as one side r bounded bipartite graphs recently grzesik janzer and nagy 14 among other things extended theorem 1 5 to a broader family of graphs called r t blowups of a tree definition 1 6 r t blowups of a tree let r t and m be positive integers a bipartite graph h is an r t blowup of a tree or r t blowup in short with root block b 0 and non root blocks b 1 bm if b 0 b 1 bm partition v h b 0 r b 1 bm t and h can be constructed by joining b 1 completely to b 0 and for each 2 i m joining bi completely to a r subset of b i for some i i 1 theorem 1 7 grzesik janzer nagy 14 let r t be positive integers if h is an r t blowup of a tree then ex n h o n 2 1 r since every one side r bounded graph is a subgraph of an r t blowup with two blocks b 0 b 1 theorem 1 7 substantially generalizes theorem 1 5 in this paper we give a common strengthening of theorem 1 3 and theorem 1 7 by proving a general theorem on the tura n and sidorenko properties of so called tree degenerate graphs definition 1 8 tree degenerate graphs a bipartite graph h is tree degenerate with root block b 0 and non root blocks b 1 bm if b 0 b 1 bm partition v h and h can be constructed by letting p b 1 b 0 and joining b 1 completely to b 0 and for each 2 i m joining bi completely to a subset p bi of b i for some 1 i i 1 such that for all i 2 p b i p bi we call p bi the parent set of bi and b i the parent block of bi and we call p the parent function we call b 0 bm p a block representation of h 3 we present our main result in terms of so called r norm density we will explain the advantage of doing so after the presenting the theorem let g be a graph with n vertices for each positive integer r we define the the r norm density of g denoted by pr g as pr g tk 1 r g 1 r note that p 1 g tk 2 g 2 e g n 2 is the usual edge density of g in general one may view pr g as a modified measure of edge density of g that takes the degree distribution into account using convexity one can show that pr g ps g whenever r s see lemma 2 3 theorem 1 9 main theorem for any graph g and positive integer let p g tk 1 g 1 let h be a tree degenerate graph with a block representation b 0 b 1 bm p let s b 0 and r maxi p bi there exist positive constants c 1 c 1 h c 2 c 2 h c 3 c 3 h depending only on h such that for any graph g th g c 1 ps g e h c 1 tk 2 g e h furthermore if hk 1 r g c 2 n r where n g then t h g c 3 pr g e h c 3 tk 2 g e h the first part of the theorem and lemma 1 2 imply the following corollary 1 10 let h be a tree degenerate graph then h satisfies sidorenko s conjecture since a bipartite graph h containing a vertex complete to the other part is tree degenerate with b 0 1 and i 1 for all i 2 corollary 1 10 generalizes theorem 1 3 a special case of the second part of theorem 1 9 yields the following corollary 1 11 let r t be positive integers let h be an r t blowup of a tree with h vertices then ex n h o n 2 1 r furthermore there exist constants c c 0 such that every n vertex graph g with hk 1 r g cn r contains at least c nh 2 e g n 2 e h copies of h corollary 1 11 strengthens theorem 1 7 in two ways first it relaxes the density requirement on g from e g n 2 1 r to hk 1 r g n r i e from p 1 g n 1 r to pr g n 1 r second it not only gives at least one copy of h but an optimal number up to a multiplicative constant of copies of h a closer examination of the proof of theorem 1 7 given by grzesik janzer and nagy in 14 shows that their proof can be strengthened to also give corollary 1 11 however theorem 1 9 is more general than corollary 1 11 as the counting statement applies to any tree degenerate graph h where parent set sizes can vary instead of just to r t blowups the relaxation of p 1 g n 1 r to pr g n 1 r is also a useful feature as in bipartite tura n problems sometimes we need to handle cases where the host graph has very uneven degree distribution and hence high r norm density despite having relatively low 1 norm density see 17 for an instance of this kind 4 to prove theorem 1 9 we introduce a notion of goodness and prove a lemma that might be viewed as a nested variant of the dependent random choice lemma once we establish the lemma the proof of theorem 1 9 readily follows conceivably this variant could find more applications we organize our paper as follows in section 2 we introduce some preliminary lemmas in section 3 we establish the nested goodness lemma in section 4 we prove theorem 1 9 in section 5 we give some concluding remarks 2 preliminary lemmas in this section we first give some useful lemmas they will be used in motivating some definitions and will also be used in the proofs in later sections we start with a standard convexity based inequality which is sometimes referred to as the power means inequality we include a proof for completeness lemma 2 1 let n be a positive integer let 1 a b be reals let x 1 xn be reals then n i 1 xai n 1 a b n i 1 xbi a b equivalently 1 n n i 1 xai 1 a 1 n n i 1 xbi 1 b proof since the function xb a is either linear or is concave up by jensen s inequality we have n i 1 x b i n i 1 x a i b a n 1 n n i 1 x a i b a rearranging we obtain the desired inequalities let g be a graph with n vertices let r be a positive integer recall that pr g tk 1 r g 1 r lemma 2 2 for any graph g and positive integers r pr g 1 n 1 n v v g d v r 1 r proof let n g recall that t 1 r g hk 1 r g n r 1 where hk 1 r g is the number of homomorphisms from k 1 r to g it is easy to see that hk 1 r g v v g d v r hence pr g tk 1 r g 1 r 1 nr 1 v v g d v r 1 r 1 n 1 n v v g d v r 1 r lemma 2 2 and lemma 2 1 imply the following useful fact lemma 2 3 for any graph g and positive integers r s we have pr g ps g 3 nested goodness lemma given a set w and a sequence s of elements of w we call s a sequence in w for brevity the length of s is defined to be number of elements in the sequence s multiplicity counted and is denoted by s given a positive integer k we let w k denote the set of sequences of length k in w and we let wk denote the set of sequences of length k in w in which the k elements are all different 5 given a graph g and a sequence s in v g the common neighborhood n s is the set of vertices adjacent to every vertex in s we now introduce a goodness notion that is inspired by lemma 2 1 of 5 a more specialized version of it was introduced in 16 definition 3 1 i good sequences let 0 1 be reals let h r be positive integers let g be an n vertex graph let p pr g tk 1 r g 1 r for each 0 i h we define an i good sequence in v g relative to h r or simply i good in short as follows we say that a sequence t in v g is 0 good if n t p t n for all 1 i h we say that a sequence s of length at most h in v g is i good if s is 0 good and for each s k h the number of i 1 good sequences of length k in n s is at least 1 n s k below is our main theorem on the goodness notion theorem 3 2 nested goodness lemma let h r be positive integers let 0 1 be a real there is a positive real depending on h r and such that the following is true let g be any graph on n vertices let p pr g tk 1 r g 1 r for any i j h let ai j denote the set of i good sequences of length j relative to h r in v g then for each i h and r j h s ai j n s r 1 nj rpjr in particular there exists an i good sequence s of size j such that n s 1 1 rpjn applying theorem 3 2 with r 1 we get the following theorem that is of independent interest theorem 3 3 let h be a positive integer let 0 1 be a real there is a positive real depending on h and such that the following is true let g be any graph on n vertices let p 2 e g n 2 for any i j h let ai j denote the set of i good sequences of length j relative to h 1 in v g then for all i h s ai j n s 1 nj 1 pj in particular there exists an i good sequence s of size j such that n s 1 pjn loosely speaking one may think of the usual dependent random choice lemma as saying that for any positive integers j h and real 0 1 there is a 1 good sequence s of size j relative to h 1 for some appropriate 0 such that most of the subsets t in n s of size at most h have their common neighborhood fractionally as large as expected in the random graph of the same edge density in that regard one may view theorem 3 3 as a strengthening of the dependent random choice lemma to a stronger notion of goodness theorem 3 2 follows from the following more technical lemma lemma 3 4 let h r be positive integers let 0 1 be a real there exists a positive real depending on h r and such that the following is true let g be a graph on n vertices let g be any 6 graph on n vertices let p pr g tk 1 r g 1 r for each 0 i h and 1 j h let ai j denote the set of i good sequences of length j relative to h r in v g and let bi j v g j ai j then for each 0 i h 1 j h and 1 j s bi j n s nj pj proof suppose has been specified we define a sequence i 0 i h by letting 0 and i h i 1 1 h for each i h for fixed h and it is easy to see that by choosing to be small enough we can ensure that i in increasing in i and h let us fix such an now let ai j and bi j be defined as stated we use induction on i to prove that for all 0 i h j h and 1 j s bi j n s in j pj for the basis step let i 0 let j h where j by definition s b 0 j n s nj pjn nj pj 0 n j pj 1 hence the claim holds for i 0 for the induction step let i 1 and suppose the claims hold when i is replaced with i 1 let j h for each j k h let cki j denote the set of sequences s in bi j such that the number of sequences of length k in n s that are not i 1 good is at least n s k by definition bi j b 0 j h k j c k i j let fk be the collection of pairs s t where s cki j and t is a sequence of length k in n s that is not i 1 good by our definition fk s ck i j n s k s ck i j n s k on the other hand for each sequence t of length k in v g that is not i 1 good the number of sequences s of length j that satisfy s t fk is most n t j hence fk t bi 1 k n t j i 1 n j kpjk where the last inequality follows from the induction hypothesis combining the lower and upper bounds on fk we get s ck i j n s k i 1 n j kpjk 2 let h such that j since j k we have k applying lemma 2 1 with a b k and using cki j n j we get s ck i j n s nj 1 k i 1 k nj kpjk k i 1 1 hnj pj 7 where we used the fact that i 1 1 by 1 and 2 we have s bi j n s s b 0 j n s h k j s ck i j n s h i 1 1 h nj pj in j pj this completes the induction and the proof we need another quick lemma given two positive integers n j let nj n n 1 n j 1 lemma 3 5 let g be a graph on n vertices and j r positive integers let p pr g tk 1 r g 1 r then s v g j n s r nj rpjr if p 4 jn 1 r then s v g j n s r 1 2 j 1 nj rpjr proof first note that t v g r n t hk 1 r g ntk 1 r g n r 1 pr hence by convexity t v g r n t j nr t v g r n t nr j nr npr j nj rpjr if p 4 jn 1 r then t v g r n t 2 j n t j nj rpjr nr 2 j j 1 2 nj rpjr hence t v g r n t 2 j n t j t v g r n t 2 j n t 2 j 1 2 j 1 nj rpjr to prove the first statement note that s v g j n s r counts pairs s t where s is a se quence of length j and t is a sequence of length r in n s by double counting we have s v g j n s r t v g r n t j nj rpjr for the second statement note that s v g j n s r counts pairs s t where s is a sequence of length j with no repetition and t is sequence of length r in n s by double counting and convexity we have s v g j n s r t v g r n t j 1 2 j 1 nj rpjr now we are ready to prove theorem 3 2 proof of theorem 3 2 let h r be positive integers and 0 1 a real let be defined as in lemma 3 4 let i h and r j h letai j denote the set of i good sequences of length j relative to h r in v g and let bi j v g j ai j by lemma 3 5 s v g j n s r nj rpjr by lemma 3 4 s bi j n s r nj rpjr hence s ai j n s r 1 nj rpjr as desired this proves the first part of the theorem now since ai j n j by averaging there exists an s ai j such that n s r 1 pjr and hence n s 1 1 rpjn this proves the second part of the theorem in order to prove the second part of theorem 1 9 we need the following variant of theorem 3 3 we omit the proof since it is almost identical to that of theorem 3 3 except that we use the second statement of lemma 3 5 instead of the first statement 8 lemma 3 6 let h r be positive integers let 0 1 be a real there is a positive real depending on h r and such that the following is true let g be any graph on n vertices let p pr g tk 1 r g 1 r for any i j h let a i j denote the set of i good sequences of length j relative to h r in v g that has no repetition if p 4 jn 1 r then for each i h and r j h s a i j n s r 1 2 j 1 nj rpjr 4 proof of theorem 1 9 proof of theorem 1 9 let n g and h h let 1 2 h 2 let be the positive constant given by theorem 3 2 for the given h and r let c 1 c 1 h 1 b 1 b 0 m i 2 bi 1 h m 1 let c 2 c 2 h 4 h and c 3 c 3 h c 1 2 h 2 suppose h has root block b 0 and non root blocks b 1 bm such that b 1 is completely joined to its parent set p b 1 b 0 and for each i 2 m bi is completely joined to its parent set p bi where p bi b i for some 1 i i and p bi p b i for each i m let fi denote the collection of all the parent sets p bj that are contained in bi let t be a tree with v t v 0 v 1 vm and edge set e t v 0 v 1 viv i m we call t the auxiliary tree for h for each i m define the depth of bi denoted by di to be the distance from v 0 to vi in t let q denote the maximum depth of a block then clearly q m h 1 let g be any graph for convenience we say that a sequence in v g is i good if it is i good relative to h r as in theorem 3 2 for each 0 i h and r j h let ai j be the set of i good sequences of length j in v g let bi j v g j ai j let a i j be the set of i good sequences of length j in v g

the event that f is injective on b 0 b 1 bi 9 recall that s b 0 and r maxi p bi by theorem 3 2 s aq b 0 n s s 1 n 2 sps 2 3 furthermore by lemma 3 6 if p 4 jn 1 r then s a q b 0 n s s 1 2 j 1 n 2 sps

b 1 1 2 h 2 b 1 p b 0 b 1 6 we now bound p f 1 e 1 recall that f 1 consists of parent sets p bj that are contained in b 1 by requirement these sets have size at least p b 1 b 0 let s be any fixed sequence in aq b 0 by the definition of aq b 0 for each b 0 k h the number of q 1 good sequences of length k in n s is at least 1 n s k so conditioning on f mapping b 0 to s and b 1 to n s the probability that f maps any particular sequence in f 1 to an q 1 good sequence is at least 1 since there are clearly at most h sequences in f 1 the probably that f maps every sequence in f 1 to a q 1 good sequence is at least 1 h hence p f 1 e 1 1 h 7 for each i 2 h we estimate p ei e 1 f 1 ei 1 fi 1 assume the event e 1 f 1 ei 1 fi 1 since p bi b i where i i by our assumption p bi is mapped to a

the theorem 5 concluding remarks in this note we used a nested variant of the dependent random choice to not only embed an appropriate tree degenerate bipartite graph h in a host graph g but also give tight up to a 11 multiplicative factor counting bound on the number of copies of h in g in this variant we get extra goodness features almost for free it will be interesting to find more applications of it another interesting feature of theorem 1 9 is that the condition of the host graph is relaxed from 1 norm density to r norm density which makes the result more flexible for applications in principle one could study the so called r norm tura n problem for bipartite graphs where one wants to determine the maximum r norm density of an h free graph on n vertices for a given bipartite graph h the problem seems particularly natural for the family of r degenerate graphs for hypergraph co degree problems such a study has recently been initiated by balogh clemen and lidicky 3 4 last but not least it will be highly desirable to make more progress on conjecture 1 4 beyond the following general bound obtained by alon krivelevich and sudakov 2 which has stood as the best known bound in the
