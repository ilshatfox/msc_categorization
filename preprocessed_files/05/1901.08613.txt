such that for every exact rb n eq coloring of n there exists a solution to eq with every member of the solution set assigned a distinct color this paper focuses on linear equations and in particular establishes the rainbow number for the equations k 1 i 1 xi xk for k 3 and k 4 the paper also establishes a general lower bound for k 5 keywords anti ramsey rainbow schur 1 introduction let 1 2 n n and eq be any equation the rainbow number of n for eq denoted rb n eq is the smallest number of colors such that for every exact rb n eq coloring of n there exists a solution to eq with every member of the solution set assigned a distinct color although much of the literature has fo cused on linear equations as does this paper this definition is general enough to define rainbow numbers for any set and any equation the rainbow number is an anti ramsey type function since the key structures are multichromatic or rain bow as opposed to monochromatic the rainbow number function was inspired by schur numbers see 6 and references therein the authors originally thought 1 http arxiv org abs 1901 08613 v 3 of the rainbow number as the anti schur number and the anti van der waer den function the anti van der waerden number on n 1 n denoted aw n k is the smallest number of colors such that every exact aw n k coloring of n is guaranteed to have an arithmetic progression of length k where each element of the progression is colored distinctly note that 3 term arithmetic progressions satisfy the equation x 1 x 2 2 x 3 the anti van der waerden number was first defined in 11 and many results on arithmetic progressions on n the cyclic groups zn finite abelian groups and graphs have been considered directly or indirectly see 1 2 3 5 8 10 12 rainbow results have also been considered for equations of the form a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a 3 x 3 b over zp see 4 7 9 an exact r coloring c of the integers 1 2 n n is a function c n r such that c is onto if eq is any linear equation on k variables namely x 1 x 2 xk and non zero coefficients then the set s 1 s 2 sk is a rainbow solution if substituting si xi makes eq true and c s 1 c s 2 c sk k note that if a solution does not have distinct elements it cannot be a rainbow solution and such solutions will be called degenerate i e the only solutions that will be considered are non degenerate the rainbow number of n for equation eq denoted rb n eq is the smallest r such that every exact r coloring of n is guaranteed to have a rainbow solution to eq a coloring is extremal with respect to eq and n if it uses rb n eq 1 colors and avoids rainbow solutions as a technical note if eq has m variables and m n or there are no solution sets to eq in n define rb n eq n 1 some more notation and a convention about the way n is colored are now introduced let c be an exact r coloring on n define ci a n c a i and define si ci such that si is the smallest element of ci for each color i note that for any exact r coloring c it is always possible to have si sj for i j if that is not the case say si sj and i j an isomorphic coloring can be created by swapping the color of any number with color i to have color j and vice versa observation 1 1 follows directly from the definition of rainbow numbers and describes the strategy used throughout the paper to find rb n eq observation 1 1 if c is an exact r 1 coloring of n that avoids rainbow solutions for eq then r rb n eq if every exact r coloring of n guarantees a rainbow solution to eq then rb n eq r example 1 2 consider the equation eq x 1 x 2 x 3 over 5 define c 5 3 by c 1 1 c 2 2 c 3 1 c 4 3 and c 5 1 since this is an exact 3 coloring that avoids rainbow solutions to eq observation 1 1 gives 4 rb 5 eq on the other hand any exact 4 coloring of 5 must either use 4 distinct colors in 1 2 3 4 or 2 3 4 5 in the former case 1 2 3 is a rainbow solution and in the latter case 2 3 5 is a rainbow solution thus rb 5 eq 4 2 2 the rainbow number of n for the equation x 1 x 2 x 3 this section focuses on the rainbow number for the equation x 1 x 2 x 3 so for the rest of the section it is assumed that eq is x 1 x 2 x 3 also when a b c is presented as a solution to eq it will be recognized that x 1 a x 2 b and x 3 c in order to discuss the results in this section it is easier if an exact r coloring uses the color set 0 1 r 1 lemma 2 1 starts with a specific coloring that avoids rainbow solutions lemma 2 1 for n 3 log 2 n 2 rb n eq proof the number of trailing zeros that an integer has is the number of ze ros starting from the right before there is a nonzero digit define an exact log 2 n 1 coloring of n as c x the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of x see example 2 2 let a b n if a and b are odd then c a c b 0 since their binary representation ends with a 1 this means a b a b is not a rainbow solution if a is odd and b is even then a b is odd so c a c a b 0 thus a b a b is not a rainbow solution finally consider the case where a and b are both even if a and b have the same number of trailing zeros then c a c b meaning a b a b is not a rainbow solution if c a 6 c b assume without loss of generality that c a c b since the number of trailing zeros of b exceeds the number of trailing zeros of a it follows via binary arithmetic that b a has the same number of trailing zeros as a thus c a b c a and a b a b is not a rainbow solution therefore no rainbow solutions exist with this coloring and log 2 n 2 rb n eq example 2 2 a table describing the coloring from lemma 2 1 x x in binary c x 1 1 0 2 10 1 3 11 0 4 100 2 5 101 0 6 110 1 7 111 0 8 1000 3 lemma 2 3 indicates that when attempting to color n and avoid rainbow so lutions there are restrictions on how quickly new colors can be added lemma 2 3 let c be an exact r coloring of n with color set 0 1 r 1 that avoids rainbow solutions then 3 1 if si then 2 si 1 for 0 i r 2 2 2 i si for 0 i r 1 proof for the first claim if 1 then i 0 so the smallest m for which s 2 m is m 2 if 2 let 1 a with a n then c a 6 c so c a c a c thus c a 6 i 1 hence 2 si 1 proving the second claim proceeds by induction on k the base case is easily observed in particular s 0 1 2 0 for the induction hypothesis assume 2 k sk for 0 k r 2 applying part 1 to our induction hypothesis yields 2 2 k 2 k 1 sk 1 which completes the proof theorem 2 4 follows almost directly from lemmas 2 1 and 2 3 theorem 2 4 for n 3 rb n eq log 2 n 2 proof by lemma 2 1 log 2 n 2 rb n 3 let r log 2 n 2 and c be an exact r coloring with color set 0 1 r 1 of n that avoids rainbow solutions then by lemma 2 3 2 r 1 sr 1 so 2 r 1 2 log 2 n 1 sr 1 thus n sr 1 so if color r 1 appears in a coloring of n there must be a rainbow solution a contradiction that such a coloring exists therefore rb n eq log 2 n 2 3 the rainbow number of n for the equation x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 this section defines eq x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 except in theorem 3 2 and an exact r coloring will use color set r lemma 3 1 is used to define a coloring on n that avoids rainbow solutions which gives a lower bound on rb n eq it is interesting to note that the equations in section 2 and 3 are similar but one result is logarithmic and the other is linear lemma 3 1 for 2 let b 1 b 2 b n with bi bi 1 for 1 i 1 such that i 1 bi n the smallest b that satisfies these conditions gives a corresponding maximum b 1 value of b 1 2 n 1 2 proof notice that by first minimizing b and then maximizing b 1 gives bi 1 bi 1 for 1 i 1 and b b 1 1 observe i 1 bi n 4 well known facts about triangular numbers gives the equivalent inequality b b 1 2 b 1 1 b 1 2 n and solving for b 1 yields b 1 2 n 1 2 since b 1 is an integer and the bi s are consecutive it can be concluded that b 1 2 n 1 2 theorem 3 2 let eq k 1 i 1 xi xk k 4 and define l 2 n 1 2 for k 2 then rb n eq n 1 if n k 1 k 2 n l 3 otherwise proof the lower bound of n 1 which is actually an equality occurs when n does not have any solutions to eq and is based on k 1 i 1 i k 1 k 2 hence every integer in n can be colored distinctly and rb n eq n 1 by definition if n does have solutions to eq then consider the coloring c on n where c x 1 if 1 x l 1 i 2 if x l i this coloring avoids rainbow solutions since any rainbow solution must have at least k 1 elements that are bigger than l and lemma 3 1 indicates that the sum of these elements is greater than n thus no rainbow solutions exist it remains to count how many colors are used the number of elements that are not colored 1 is n l 1 thus c uses n l 2 colors since c avoids rainbow solutions this gives n l 3 rb n eq corollary 3 3 for n 5 1 2 n 7 rb n eq proof as noted in the introduction to section 3 eq in this problem has k 4 and 2 thus so l n 1 2 applying theorem 3 2 gives the result proposition 3 4 if n is odd and n 5 then rb n eq 1 2 n 7 and there is a unique extremal coloring of n 5 proof when n 5 the result is immediate when n 7 the lower bound is a result of corollary 3 3 the upper bound is trivial since the only coloring of 7 with seven colors is to color each number distinctly if c is an extremal coloring of 7 then 6 colors are used since 1 2 3 6 and 1 2 4 7 are both solutions c 1 c 2 and the coloring is unique for the induction hypothesis assume that for all odd k with 7 k n n odd that rb k eq 1 2 k 7 and there is a unique extremal coloring of k namely the coloring provided in theorem 3 2 define r 1 2 n 2 7 l n 1 2 and let c be an exact r coloring of n 2 with color set 1 r the induction hypothesis implies that if r or r 1 colors appear in n then there is a rainbow solution so sr n 2 and sr 1 n 1 the induction hypothesis also implies that if r 2 colors appear in n there is a unique coloring of n with r 2 colors that avoids rainbow solutions however applying the unique coloring yields c 1 1 c l 2 c l 1 3 and c n 1 r 1 3 thus 1 l l 1 n 1 is a rainbow solution therefore rb n 2 eq 1 2 n 9 equality comes from the lower bound in corollary 3 3 now let c be an exact r 1 coloring of n 2 with color set 1 2 r 1 that avoids rainbow solutions if r 1 colors appear in n the inductive hypothesis implies there is a rainbow solution thus n 1 sr 1 n 2 if r 2 colors appear in n then n has the coloring from theorem 3 2 this means s 2 l and s 3 l 1 hence either 1 l l 1 n 1 or 2 l l 1 n 2 is a rainbow solution since n 1 sr 1 n 2 therefore n sr 2 which implies sr 2 n 1 and sr 1 n 2 now consider the case where r 3 colors appear in n if r j 1 colors appear in n 2 j 2 for 2 j n 3 4 then the coloring from theorem 3 2 gives lj n 2 j 2 1 2 l j 1 s 2 l j 2 s 3 n 2 j 2 sr j 1 however notice that l j 1 l l 1 n 2 j 2 n 1 thus 1 l l 1 n 1 is a rainbow solution which implies n 2 j 3 sr j 1 combining this with si si 1 gives n 2 j 3 sr j 1 n j 2 note that inequality gives s 2 sr r 3 1 n r 3 2 l 1 the remainder of the proof will show that if s 2 6 l 1 then there is a rainbow solution this then implies that s 2 l 1 and c must be the coloring from theorem 3 2 set n 2 1 a b n 1 n n 1 n 2 with a 2 3 l and b l 1 l 2 n 2 note that a b l 1 n 3 2 and that s 2 a also for any x a the set 1 x n x n 1 is a solution to eq and c 1 1 6 r 2 c n 1 this implies that each element of the pair 6 x n x is either the same color or at least one of them is color 1 further since x a and n x b c a b uses at most l 1 of the remaining 2 3 r 3 r 4 l 1 colors this forces c n 2 r 4 c n 1 r 3 and each pair x n x contributing one color from 2 3 r 5 that is not accounted for among any other y n y pair for y a however now 1 s 2 n s 2 1 n 2 is a rainbow solution to see this observe that c s 2 1 1 and if c n s 2 1 2 then the s 2 1 n s 2 1 pair contributes the color 2 so the s 2 n s 2 pair must contribute a color that is not 2 this means c n s 2 6 2 which makes 1 s 2 n s 2 n 1 a rainbow solution lemma 3 5 if n 5 is odd then rb n 1 eq 1 2 n 7 proof let r 1 2 n 7 and c be an exact r coloring of n 1 if r colors appear in n then by proposition 3 6 there exists a rainbow solution thus c n 1 r and r 1 colors appear in n note that there is unique extremal coloring of n with r 1 colors thus 1 n 1 2 n 1 2 n 1 is a rainbow solution since c 1 1 c n 1 2 2 c n 1 2 3 and c n 1 r therefore rb n 1 eq 1 2 n 7 theorem 3 6 follows proposition 3 4 and lemma 3 5 theorem 3 6 for n 5 rb n eq 1 2 n 7 4 conclusion it is believed that future work on equations of the form k 1 i 1 xi xk k 5 should focus on the coloring exhibited in theorem 3 2 and arguments should utilize si data indicates that there are unique colorings when k 5 for n 9 12 15 and colorings for other values of n are closely related to the unique colorings
