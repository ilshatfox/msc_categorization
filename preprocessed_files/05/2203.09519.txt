functions fn as given in 5 a 5 b it is proven by induction that the fn solve the recurrence relation 8 a 8 b 8 c and satisfy the reflection property 14 section 2 contains some definitions used in sections 3 and 4 in section 3 it is shown that the functions fn can be expressed as linear combinations 24 of functions jn k 1 with coefficients k being determined by the recurrence relation 26 a 26 b 1 http arxiv org abs 2203 09519 v 1 section 4 is dedicated to the further analysis of the functions jn 1 n fold powers of the j operator 21 b applied to the 1 function they can be decomposed 28 into expressions of the type qj x ln x n j with functions qj being generated by the recurrence relation 29 a 29 b the functions qj in turn are power series 32 in 1 x whose coefficients are determined by 33 a 33 b here lower triangular integer matrices asm j become involved which may be computed from 34 a 34 b example data are listed in table 1 1 convolution powers of 1 x let and a be real parameters fulfilling the condition a 0 1 define real functions a r r a x 0 x 2 a a x 1 x a x 2 b convolution powers wikb of a are defined by the recurrence relation 1 a a 3 a n 1 a x a x t n a t dt x r n 1 3 b cut off condition 2 a translates into the general property n a x 0 x n n 1 4 regarding the non zero part of n a x consider the transformation n a x n x n a fn 1 x n a x n n 1 5 a fn 1 y y n n a n a a y n y 0 n 1 5 b the functions fn are defined on non negative real numbers and their index n starts from zero 2 rewriting 3 a 3 b in terms of fn yields fo 1 6 a n 1 fn y y n 1 y o 1 y s 1 1 s n fn 1 s ds y o 1 y s 1 fn 1 s ds y o 1 s n fn 1 s ds y 0 n 1 6 b this makes clear that through the transformation 5 a 5 b the parameters and a have been eliminated 6 b implies fn 0 0 n 1 7 consider the set of conditions fo 1 8 a fn 0 0 n 1 8 b f n y 1 y n fn 1 y y 0 n 1 8 c 8 a and 8 b just repeat 6 a and 7 in the recurrence relation 8 c f n denotes the derivative of fn with respect to its argument assertion 8 c will be proved by induction replacing n 1 in 6 b while observing 6 a gives 2 f 1 y y o 1 y s 1 ds y o 1 s 1 ds ln y s 1 ln s 1 s y s o 2 ln y 1 y 0 9 which verifies the induction hypothesis 8 c for n 1 when deriving 6 b with respect to y while applying the leibniz integral rule wikd one gets n 1 f n y 1 1 y n fn 1 y y o 1 y s 1 2 fn 1 s ds y 0 n 1 10 3 substituting n n 1 and applying partial integration to the second term with respect to s yields n 2 f n 1 y 1 y n 1 fn y 1 y 1 fn 0 y o 1 y s 1 f n s ds y 0 n 0 11 on the other hand using the induction hypothesis 8 c and 6 b we have y o 1 y s 1 f n s ds y o 1 y s 1 1 s n fn 1 s ds n 1 y n 1 fn y y 0 n 1 12 finally inserting 12 into 11 gives f n 1 y 1 n 2 n 2 y n 1 fn y 1 y 1 fn 0 y 0 n 1 13 from which the induction step follows if one observes 8 b the non recursive reflection property y o 1 y s 1 fn s ds n 1 y o 1 s n 1 fn s ds y 0 n 0 14 follows as a corollary if one replaces fn y y o f n s ds 8 c y o 1 s n fn 1 s ds in the left hand side of 6 b 2 some definitions given a smooth real function f declare the harmonic integration operator h as the an tiderivative wika h f f x x dx 15 in particular if g denotes a power series in 1 x with radius of convergence c 0 g x k 0 ak x k x 1 c 0 16 4 one gets h g x ao ln x k 1 ak k x k x 1 c 17 here ln denotes the natural logarithm clearly if g x converges for x 1 c so does the second term in 17 more generally applying h multiple times we get hm g x ao ln x m m 1 m k 1 ak km x k m 0 x 1 c 18 let denote the backward difference operator wikc f x f x f x 1 19 applying to 16 and to the natural logarithm gives g x k 2 k 1 r 1 k 1 r ak r x k x 1 c 1 20 a ln x li 1 1 x x 1 20 b in 20 b the notation lis refers to the polylogarithm wike finally declare the operators s i 21 a j h s 21 b in 21 a i denotes the identity operator 3 decomposition of fn in terms of j n k 1 it is shown in this section that solutions fn of the recurrence relation 8 a 8 b 8 c are linear combinations of jn k 1 applying x d dx to jm 1 one gets x d dx jm 1 x x d dx h s jm 1 1 x s jm 1 1 x jm 1 1 x 1 x m m 1 22 hence replacing x y n in 22 for n m y n d dy jm 1 y n jm 1 1 y n 1 y 0 n m 1 23 5 therefore if one writes fn y n k 0 k j n k 1 y n y 0 n 0 24 and applies y n d dy to 24 while making use of 23 one gets y n d dy fn y n k 0 k y n d dy jn k 1 y n n 1 k 0 k j n 1 k 1 y n 1 fn 1 y y 0 n 1 25 here the fact has been exploited that d dy jo 1 d dy 1 0 25 clearly reproduces 8 c while 8 a 8 b impose the following recurrence relation on the coefficients o 1 26 a n n 1 k 0 k j n k 1 n n
