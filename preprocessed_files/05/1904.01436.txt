lattice for p x we say that p is t intersecting if rank x y t for all x y p the seminal theorem of erdo s ko and rado describes the maximum intersecting p in the lattice of subsets of a finite set with the additional condition that p is contained within a level of the lattice the erdo s ko rado theorem has been extensively studied and generalized to other objects and lattices in this paper we focus on intersecting families of permutations as defined with respect to the weak bruhat lattice in this setting we prove analogs of certain ex tremal results on intersecting set systems in particular we give a characterization of the maximum intersecting families of permutations in the bruhat lattice we also characterize the maximum intersecting families of permutations within the rth

uregina ca 1 http arxiv org abs 1904 01436 v 1 1 introduction let l x be a lattice for p x we say that p is t intersecting if rank x y t for all x y p if l is the subset lattice two subsets a b are t intersecting exactly when a b t we will refer to 1 intersecting sets simply as intersecting sets the problem of finding maximum collections of intersecting sets has a long history see 6 and the references within perhaps the most famous result is the erdo s ko rado ekr theorem 3 this theorem gives the size of the largest collection of sets at level r in the subset lattice such that any two of the sets intersect theorem 1 1 let r and n be integers with n 2 r if a is an intersecting collection of r subsets of the set 1 n then a n 1 r 1 moreover if n 2 r equality holds if and only if a consists of all the r subsets that contain a common element another well known result is katona s theorem 10 which gives the size of the largest collection of t intersecting sets with no restriction on the size of the sets in the subset lattice on n points if n t 2 v then this maximum size is achieved by the collection of all subsets with size larger than v if n t 2 v 1 an example of a collection of maximum size is the collection that contains all subsets with size at least v along with all subsets of size v 1 that do not contain a fixed element in the special case that t 1 these sets have size 2 n 1 this implies that the collection of all subsets that contain a fixed element is a 1 intersecting set of maximum size in this case there are also many other non isomorphic collections of maximum size one of the reasons that the ekr theorem is so famous is that versions of it hold for many other objects for example there are versions for integer sequences vector spaces over a finite field perfect matchings independent sets in graphs and permutations these are just a few of the examples again see 6 and the references within for more details in this paper we give versions of katona s theorem and the erdo s ko rado the orem for the weak bruhat lattice of permutations we start with some general results for all lattices next we define and give properties of the weak bruhat lattice section 4 has information about properties of intersecting sets in the bruhat lattice and a charac terization for the maximum intersecting collections of intersecting permutations in the bruhat lattice section 5 gives a version of the ekr theorem for permutations in level r of the bruhat lattice provided that n is large relative to r in the sequel collections of sets will be called systems and collections of permutations will be called families 2 2 general lattices for a subset f of elements in a lattice l x define the upset of f to be up f z x x z some x f similarly the downset of f is defined to be down f z x z x some x f for any f if up f f then we say that f is an upset similarly f is a downset if down f f upsets and downsets are also called filters and ideals respectively for a single element p l the family up p which we abbreviate up p is called a star with center p if the rank of p is t then up p is t intersecting we call up p a canonical t intersecting family more generally for some h l we define up h f up f h in this paper we only consider the case where h is the set of all elements in l with rank k this set is denoted by lk if rank p t then uplk p is called a t star at level k define ft l to be the maximum size of a t intersecting family from the lattice l we say that l has the t ekr property or is t ekr if ft l is equal to the size of a t star equivalently l has the t ekr property if ft l maxp lt up p a lattice that has the 1 ekr property will simply be said to have the ekr property similarly ft lk is defined to be the maximum size of a t intersecting family in level k of the lattice the level lk has the t ekr property or is t ekr if the size of the largest t intersecting family of lk can be realized by a t star at level k this is equivalent to saying that ft lk maxp lt uplk p again we suppress the use of t when t 1 the erdo s ko rado theorem is equivalent to saying that in the subset lattice all levels below n 2 have the 1 ekr property wilson 14 proved the subset lattice for 1 n has the t ekr property at level k provided that n t 1 k t 1 frankl 5 had previously proved this with the restriction that t 14 ahlswede and khachatrian s complete intersection theorem 1 describes all the largest intersecting sets for all values of n k and t we say that a lattice l is uniquely complemented if for all x x there exists a unique y x such that rank x y 0 and rank x y rank l a lattice is distributive if for all x y z l the following holds x y z x y x z theorem 2 1 any uniquely complemented distributive lattice has the ekr property proof assume that l is a uniquely complemented lattice and denote the least element in l by 0 denoting the complement of an element x l by x at most one of the pair 3 x x can belong to an intersecting family thus an intersecting set can be no larger than l 2 let p be any element of the lattice with rank 1 and assume that for some x l both x and x are not comparable to p then 0 p x p x p x x p which is a contradiction thus for any element x l either x or x is comparable to p since p is rank 1 this means that either x or x is above p in the lattice and so up p l 2 since the subset lattice is uniquely complemented this theorem implies that the subset lattice has the ekr property katona s theorem shows that the subset lattice does not have the t ekr property for t 1 it seems to be harder to find general results about maximum intersecting families within a level of a lattice many of the standard proofs for the ekr property use regularity conditions on the set suda 12 considered the t ekr property for levels in semi lattices with regularity conditions the bruhat lattice is different since it does not satisfy these regularity conditions specifically the upsets of different elements at the same level may have different sizes this makes the bruhat lattice a particularly interesting lattice to consider more details are given in the next section 3 properties of the weak bruhat lattice the right weak bruhat ordering on the symmetric group produces a lattice b n sym n for any permutation p sym n we write p p 1 p 2 pn to mean p i pi this is the second line in the two line notation the covering relation that generates the relation is defined by p 1 p 2 pn q 1 q 2 qn whenever there is some i 1 n 1 such that pi pi 1 qi pi 1 qi 1 pi and qk pk otherwise this means that p q if q is obtained by reversing two consecutive and increasing elements from p see figure 1 for b 4 the transpositions i i 1 for i 1 n 1 are called the generators and we will denote the generator i i 1 by gi we also define gn gi 1 i n to be the generating set for b n from another point of view b n is the cayley graph generated by gn turned into a lattice with ranks given by distance from the identity id the set of all permutations at rank in b n is denoted by b n for a permutation p sym n we define its set of inverse descents by id p gi i 1 precedes i in p 4 and for a set of permutations p we define id p id p p p the set of inverse descents play an important role in the bruhat lattice since for any p sym n we have gi id p if and only if gi p in the weak order we denote the inversion set for a permutation p sym n by inv p pj pi 1 i j n pj pi with this definition rank p inv p our definition of inverse descents is nonstandard usually the inverse descents are integers but we are using the simple transpositions indexed by those integers the inversion sets of different permutations are always distinct while their inverse descent sets are sometimes not for example id 3214 g 1 g 2 inv 3214 1 2 1 3 2 3 id 3241 g 1 g 2 inv 3241 1 2 1 3 1 4 2 3 1 for a set a gn define the multiplicity of a by p b n id p a and the multiplicity of a at level by p b n id p a for example consider the set g 1 g 4 its multiplicity in b 2 6 is 1 since 213546 is the only permutation with rank 2 and inverse descents set exactly g 1 g 4 its multiplicity in b 3 6 is 3 since each of 1 3 3 5 and 4 6 may be reversed to increase the rank without introducing a new inverse descent the permutations in b 3 6 with inverse descents set g 1 g 4 are 231546 215346 and 213564 lemma 3 1 the multiplicity of any k set of generators at level of b n is at most k 1 k 1 ek 2 3 proof let s gi 1 gi 2 gik be a k set of generators and b s be the set of per mutations at level of b n whose inverse descent set is s set i 0 0 ik 1 n and assume i 1 i 2 ik any permutation in b s will preserve the natural order of each of the sets s 0 1 2 i 1 s 1 i 1 1 i 2 sk ik 1 n and so we can identify every permutation in b s with a permutation of the multiset ms 1 i 1 2 i 2 i 1 kik ik 1 k 1 n ik in general there will be more multiset permutations than elements of b s an inversion in the multiset permutation represents an inversion in the corresponding permutation in b s the q multinomial coefficient n i 1 i 2 i 1 ik ik 1 n ik n i 1 n i 1 i 2 i 1 n ik n ik 2 5 is the generating function by inversions for permutations of ms see 11 there fore b s is less than the coefficient of q in 2 the coefficient of q in 2 is a 1 a 2 ak k j 1 aaj where aaj is the coefficient of q aj in n ij 1 ij ij 1 in other words b s a 1 a 2 ak k j 1 aaj 3 since n ij 1 ij ij 1 is the generating function by size for partitions whose young dia gram fits inside an ij ij 1 n ij rectangle see 11 aaj is the number of partitions of aj with at most ij ij 1 parts whose first part is at most n ij we can crudely bound aaj by p the number of partitions of and replace the bound in 3 with b s a 1 a 2 ak p k 4 the number of weak compositions of with k parts is k 1 k 1 11 and p e 2 3 2 chapter 5 so we can replace 4 by b s k 1 k 1 ek 2 3 which is our result the bound above is often much larger than the actual multiplicity of a set the next result gives a much stronger bound for the number of permutations in a level with the property that every inversion is a generator a set of inverse descents is called a separated set if it does not contain generators gi and gi 1 for any i proposition 3 2 if a permutation p in level of b n has an inverse descents set of size then the inverse descents set must be a separated set proof assume that a is a set of size that is not a separated set then i i 1 a for some i any permutation that has both i and i 1 in its inverse descents set must also have i i 2 in its inversion set thus the inversion set for any p with id p a must have at least 1 elements and p is above rank so the multiplicity of a in b n is 0 the next claim follows from directly from the definitions of the relation in the bruhat order inverse descents sets and inversion sets 6 1234 2134 1324 1243 2314 3124 1342 2143 1423 2341 3214 3142 2413 1432 4123 3241 2431 3412 4213 4132 3421 4231 4312 4321 1 2 3 1 2 2 1 3 3 1 1 2 2 1 3 2 3 3 1 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 3 1 2 1 3 2 3 1 2 3 figure 1 two representations of the bruhat lattice b 4 on the left vertices are labeled by p p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 where p i pi on the right each vertex p is labeled by its set of inverse descents id p claim 3 3 let p q b n then the following hold 1 if p q then id p id q 2 p q if and only if inv p inv q 3 p q 6 id if and only if id p id q 6 the converse of statement 1 in the above claim is not true since it is possible to have incomparable permutations p and q with id p id q for example 2431 and 4213 are incomparable but have the same set of inverse descents corollary 3 4 let p q b n then id p q id p id q proof statement 1 implies that id p q id p id q conversely if gi id p id q then i i 1 p q and gi id p q thus id p q id p id q and the result follows for a subset a gn let a gi a gi this permutation is called the minimal element for a since b n is a lattice p is well defined and unique 7 lemma 3 5 for any subset a gn in the bruhat ordering p a is the unique minimum permutation such that id p a further for any q with id q a both inv p inv q and p q hold proof since a gi agi it follows that id p a let q be any other permutation with id q a then for any g 1 a it follows that g 1 q and so p q and by claim 3 3 2 inv p inv q lemma 3 5 implies that a min p b n id p a lemma 3 5 also shows that the multiplicity for any inverse descents set is at least 1 however it is possible to have a set that is not an inversion set for any permutation for example there is no permutation with the inversion set 1 2 2 3 if 2 is before 1 and 3 is before 2 then 3 is also before 1 the goal of the next section is to give properties of intersecting families in the bruhat lattice in order to characterize the extremal intersecting sets 4 properties of intersecting sets in b n the bruhat ordering on permutations is not a uniquely complemented lattice but the permutations can be paired so that the pairs have no common elements in either their inverse descents or their inversion sets the permutation p p 1 p 2 pn is paired with the permutation p pn p 2 p 1 these pairs have the property that inv p i j 1 i j n inv p and also that id p gn id p with this paring a version of theorem 2 1 holds for the bruhat lattice we alter notation slightly to write ft b n as ft n and ft bk n as ft k n theorem 4 1 let n be an integer with n 2 then f 1 n n 2 proof let x be a permutation at level 1 in b n assume that id x gi the upset of x is the set of all permutations that have i in its inverse descents set for each p b n exactly one of p and p will have i in its inverse descents set corollary 4 2 the bruhat lattice has the 1 ekr property 8 the next goal is to give a characterization of the maximum intersecting families in b n if p b n is an intersecting family of permutations of maximum size then p n 2 and so for every permutation p either p p or p p an intersecting family p is called maximal if every permutation that intersects all the permutations in p is also in p equivalently there are no elements not in p that intersect all the elements in p for a family p b n define min p p p if there exists q p with q p then q p observe that p is an antichain if and only if min p p further if p is a maximal intersecting family then up min p p lemma 4 3 let p b n be a maximal intersecting family if p min p then p id p proof let p min p and set a id p then for any permutation q p we have that id q a 6 thus a intersects every q p since p is maximal a p by definition of a we have a p and since p is minimal in p we have p a in developing our characterization of maximum intersecting families we will move between permutations and their sets of inverse descents to do this we will use the following lemma lemma 4 4 let p b n then the following statements are equivalent 1 p is intersecting 2 up p is intersecting 3 min p is intersecting 4 id p is an intersecting set system 5 if g is a system of subsets of gn with p g g g then g is intersecting proof since b n is a poset for all p p q q p with p p and q q it follows that p q p q this implies that if a family p is intersecting then up p is also intersecting this fact shows that statement 1 implies statement 2 statement 2 implies statement 3 since min p up p statement 3 implies statement 1 since p up min p thus the first three statements are equivalent 9 finally statement 3 of claim 3 3 implies that statements 4 and 5 are equivalent to 1 for any set system a defined on an n 1 set which we may take to be gn there is a corresponding subfamily of b n defined by p a up a a a this means that p a is the family of all permutations p such that there exists an a a such that a id p corollary 4 5 if a is an intersecting set system on gn then p a is an intersecting family in the bruhat ordering proof this follows from statement 3 of claim 3 3 and part 5 of lemma 4 4 further it is possible to construct a set system from a family of permutations if p is a family of permutations then id min p is a set system on gn called the generating set for p the next three lemmas give properties of this set system lemma 4 6 let p b n be an intersecting family and define a id min p then a is an intersecting set system further if p is maximal then p p if and only if a id p for some a a proof the first statement is clear from statement 3 of claim 3 3 the implication in the second statement follows from the definition of a in par ticular if p p then a id p for some a a conversely for any permutation p if a id p for some a a then a p and a p since p is maximal this implies that p p corollary 4 7 let p b n then p p id min p if p is a maximal intersect ing family then p p id min p the next result shows that id is a weak order preserving map on the poset so it preserves the min operation corollary 4 8 let p b n be a maximal intersecting family of permutations then id min p min id p 10 proof from part 1 of claim 3 3 if p q then id p id q this implies that if id p min id p then p min p thus min id p id min p conversely if id p id min p then id p id p for some p min p since p is maximal lemma 4 3 implies that p id p if there is a set id q id p with id q id p then id q id p which contradicts p min p this means that id p is a minimal set in id p and thus id p id p min id p corollary 4 8 implies that id min p is an antichain we call a a maximal intersect ing antichain if a is an intersecting antichain with the additional property that for any set b 6 a there is a set a a such that either a b or a b equivalently an intersecting antichain a is a maximal intersecting antichain if for any b with x b 6 for all x a there exists an a a with a b lemma 4 9 let p b n be a maximal intersecting family and define a id min p then a is a maximal intersecting antichain proof from corollary 4 6 a must be intersecting since a id min p corollary 4 8 implies a min id p and that a is an antichain suppose that a is not a maximal intersecting antichain then there must be some b 6 a such that a b is intersecting and there is no a a with a b let p b since no a a has the property that a id p we have that p 6 p then p p is a intersecting family contradicting the maximality of p at this point to avoid unnecessary technicalities we associate any set of integers with the set of generators having those integers as subscripts e g 1 3 4 g 1 g 3 g 4 there are many maximal intersecting set systems that are not maximal intersecting antichains for example consider the following system of r subsets of m 1 m with m 2 r defined by hm r k h m r h 1 2 k 1 k 5 where 1 k r m 1 2 if k 1 this is the canonical intersecting set but the set system hm r k is a maximally intersecting antichain if and only if k r if r k consider the set r m which intersects each set in hm r k since r k the set r m is neither contained in nor contains any of the sets from hm r k the 11 following sets are examples of maximally intersecting antichains a a m r a 1 2 2 r 1 r b 12 13 14 15 1 m 234 m and c 123 134 145 156 126 235 245 246 346 356 on an 6 set the sets below are not maximally intersecting antichains d a m r a 1 2 2 k 1 k if r k and e a m r 1 a if r 1 the final theorem of this section is our characterization of the maximum intersecting families in the bruhat lattice theorem 4 10 let p b n be an intersecting family and define a id min p then p is maximum if and only if a is a maximal intersecting antichain and p p a proof we have already seen in lemma 4 9 that if p is maximum then a is a maximal intersecting antichain further by corollary 4 7 p p a assume that a is a maximal intersecting antichain and p p a we will show that for every permutation p either p p or p p for a permutation p b n let b id p if b intersects every set in a then by maximality a b for some a a this implies that p up a p if b does not intersect every set in a then b a for some a a this implies that a b so p up a p a p from corollary 4 5 the family p hm r k defined in equation 5 is intersect ing there are many different set systems that are isomorphic to hm r k formed by permuting the underlying set it is possible that isomorphic maximal intersecting an tichains give rise to non isomorphic maximum intersecting families of permutations for example when m r k 6 2 2 then h 6 2 2 1 2 1 3 2 3 and h 1 3 1 5 3 5 is isomorphic to h 6 2 2 both set systems can be used to construct an intersecting set of permutations in the bruhat order p h 6 2 2 up 321456 214356 143256 p h up 214356 213465 124365 12 both of these sets have size 360 but they are non isomorphic families in b n this can be seen since the ranks of 321456 and 143256 are 3 whereas the other permutations are of rank 2 one can see that the key distinction here is that the sets in h are separated sets the final corollary of this section follows from theorem 4 10 corollary 4 11 let h be a set system isomorphic to hm r k with 1 k r m 1 2 if k r then p h m 2 while if k r then p h m 2 5 erdo s ko rado theorem for levels in the bruhat lattice in this section we prove that an erdo s ko rado theorem holds for the rth level of b n provided that n is large relative to r recall that br n denotes the set of all permutations of rank r in the bruhat lattice b n and that br n is ekr if the size of its largest intersecting subfamily is no larger than the largest 1 star at level r it is clear that b 2 n is ekr in this section we first give a proof that b 3 n is ekr and more generally that br n is ekr provided that n is large relative to r lemma 5 1 let h b 3 n and p b 1 n then uph p n 1 2 proof define the polynomial m 1 x xm 1 then the generating function for the sizes of the ranks in b n is f x n 1 x 1 x x 2 1 x x 2 xn 1 from 13 the generating function for the sizes of the ranks in up p where rank p 1 is given by the generating function f x 1 x n 1 x 1 x x 2 1 x x 2 xn 1 hence up h p is the coefficient of x 2 in f x 1 x this coefficient is the same as that in 1 x x 2 n 2 which is n 2 2 n 2 n 1 2 we will use the following result of holroyd spencer and talbot 7 on ekr theorems for separated sets theorem 5 2 7 the largest intersecting system of separated r sets from an m set has size m r r 1 and consists of all the separated sets that contain some fixed point 13 theorem 5 3 the set b 3 n is ekr for all n 3 proof if n 3 the result is evident so we let n 4 let p b 3 n be an intersecting family of maximum size we are done if p is a star so we assume otherwise let pi p p id p i where i 1 2 3 clearly p 3 i 1 pi if p p 1 then since p is intersecting every permutation in p has the single element in id p in its inverse descent set this implies that p is a star and we are done so we may assume that p 1 now we will consider pi for i 1 any permutation p in p 3 must have id p inv p since it is a rank 3 permutation with 3 inverse descents and by proposition 3 2 id p must be a separated set and every set inv p for p p 3 has multiplicity 1 thus the set system id p p p 3 is an intersecting system of separated sets that has the same size as p 3 by theorem 5 2 with m n 1 we have p 3 n 4 2 next consider p 2 and define the set system a 2 id p p p 2 clearly a 2 is an intersecting 2 set system if a 2 4 then a 2 must contain four sets isomorphic to 12 13 14 15 since the inverse descent sets for the permutations in p 2 and p 3 are sets of size no more than 3 and these inverse descents sets intersect all the sets in a 2 this implies that all the permutations in both p 2 and p 3 must have a common element in their inverse descent thus if a 2 4 then p is a star so we can assume that a 2 3 the multiplicity of any set in a 2 is no more than 4 so p 2 12 since p is not a star we have p 12 n 4 2 1 2 n 2 9 n 44 6 which is no more than n 1 2 1 2 n 2 3 n 2 provided that n 7 for n 6 equation 6 provides a bound which is at most the size of a star in the poset if n 4 then from figure 1 each set in a 2 has multiplicity 2 the bound in equation 6 becomes p 3 which is exactly the size of a star in the poset similarly when n 5 the multiplicities of the sets in a 2 are no more than 2 and the bound becomes p 6 this again is the size of a star in the poset finally when n 6 the multiplicity is no more than 3 and the bound is p 3 3 1 10 this also is the size of a star in the poset next we will use a counting method similar to the one used in theorem 5 3 to show that br n is ekr provided that n is sufficiently large first we will prove a lower bound on the size of a star in br n and then give two known results that can be used to show that if an intersecting set is sufficiently large then there are minimum number of sets that intersect in exactly one element 14 lemma 5 4 let h br n and p b 1 n then uph p n 2 r 1 proof as we have seen if p b 1 n then the size of uph p is given by the coefficient of x r 1 in n x 1 1 x x 2 1 x x 2 x 3 1 x x 2 xn 1 there are n 2 r 1 ways to select the term x from r 1 different factors so the coefficient of x r 1 is at least n 2 r 1 the next result is the hilton milner theorem this result gives a bound on the size of an intersecting set system in which the sets do not all contain a common element theorem 5 5 8 if a is an intersecting system of k subsets of an m set with a aa then a m 1 k 1 m k 1 k 1 1 we will also use a version of erdo s matching conjecture due to frankl theorem 5 6 4 let a be a system of k subsets of anm set assume that a contains no r 1 pairwise disjoint sets and that m 2 r 1 k r then a m k m r k the previous two results can be used to show that if an intersecting set system is sufficiently large then there will be many sets that intersect in exactly in one common element lemma 5 7 let f be an intersecting system of sets on an n 1 set with 2 and n 2 r 1 1 r 2 if r and f n 2 1 n 2 r 1 then every set in f includes a fixed element x and f contains at least r 1 sets that pairwise intersect in exactly the element x 15 proof first note that since 2 r it follows that f n 1 1 1 n 1 1 1 1 and theorem 5 5 implies that every set in f contains some element x every set in f contains x so let fx be the family of 1 sets on an n 2 set formed by removing x from every set in f applying theorem 5 6 to fx yields that for the stated values of n the family fx contains at least r 1 sets that are pairwise disjoint the previous lemma will be used to bound the number of permutations p in an intersecting family in br n that have id p r theorem 5 2 will be used to bound the number of such p having id p r since in this case proposition 3 2 implies that id p is a separated set theorem 5 8 the set br n is ekr for n sufficiently large relative to r proof we may assume that r 3 since we have seen that both b 2 n and b 3 n are ekr let p br n be an intersecting family of maximum size we are done if p is a star so we assume otherwise as in the proof for b 3 n let pi p p id p i where i 1 2 r clearly p r i 1 pi further set ai id p p pi as in the proof of theorem 5 3 if p 1 6 then then p is a star so we may assume that p 1 now we will consider p for 2 r 1 by lemma 5 7 if a n 2 1 n 2 r 1 then a is a star centered on some x which contains at least r 1 sets that pairwise intersect at exactly x every p p has id p r and intersects each of these r 1 sets thus each id p contains x meaning that p is a star hence we may assume that a n 2 1 n 2 r 1 for each 2 r 1 finally since ar is an intersecting family of separated r sets from an n 1 set theorem 5 2 implies that ar n 1 r r 1 the multiplicity of any set from a in p is at most r 1 1 e 2 r 3 thus p n 1 r r 1 r 1 2 r 1 1 e 2 r 3 n 2 1 n 2 r 1 n 1 r r 1 r 1 2 r 1 1 e 2 r 3 r 2 j 3 n j 2 7 n 3 r 1 r 2 2 r 2 r 2 e 3 r 3 2 r n 3 r 3 8 equation 7 follows from repeated applications of pascal s rule the bounds used in equation 8 are very rough upper bounds 16 provided that n is larger than r 2 2 r 2 r 2 e 3 r 3 2 r r 2 r the size of p is less than n 2 r 1 which by lemma 5 4 is less than the size of the largest star the previous result uses a very rough counting method to bound the size of an intersecting family of permutations that is not a star we believe that the lower bound on n given above is far larger than necessary in fact we conjecture that all levels below the middle level in the weak bruhat lattice have the ekr property conjecture 5 9 for all values of 1 r 1 2 n 2 the set br n is ekr thus for any p b 1 n we have f 1 r n up p which equals the coefficient of xr 1 in f x 1 x figure 1 reveals that the conjecture holds for b 4 the upper bound on r is based on the fact that permutations in levels above 1 2 n 2 have larger sets of inverse descents for sufficiently large r the entire r level is intersecting since the size of the inverse descent sets are large we suspect that for levels above 1 2 n 2 the sets of all permutations with inverse descent sets of size at least n 1 2 are larger than a star 6 t intersecting families in this section we conjecture that a version of the ekr theorem holds for some levels of the bruhat lattice for t intersecting permutations the original version of the ekr theorem was for t intersecting sets and can be stated as follows theorem 6 1 let k t and n be positive integers with t k assume that a is a t intersecting system of k subsets of 1 n there exists a function f k t such that if n f k t then a n t k t moreover equality holds if and only if a is a t star at level k similar to the ekr theorem for t intersecting k sets we conjecture that the largest t intersecting family of rank k permutations in the bruhat lattice is the upset of a permutation at level t unlike the case for sets the sizes of the upsets of the permutations at level t are not all equal in the bruhat lattice before stating the conjecture we need 17 to determine which permutation at level t we believe has the maximum number of rank r permutations in its upset consider the permutation t that is formed by starting with the trivial permuta tion 1 2 n and reversing exactly t pairs in 1 n these reversals are done iteratively in t steps at each step the largest element in the permutation that has a smaller element directly before it this is the largest element with a smaller element on its left is switched with the element directly to the left of it for example for n 6 we have 0 123456 1 123465 2 123645 3 126345 4 162345 5 612345 6 612354 7 612534 8 615234 9 651234 10 651243 11 651423 12 654123 13 654132 14 654312 15 654321 if i and j are positive integers with i chosen as large as possible so that t n 1 n 2 n i n i j 1 9 then t n n 1 n i 1 1 2 j n i j 1 j 2 n i 1 the set inv t is the set of the final t transpositions in the lexicographic ordering for example if n 6 then inv 11 2 4 3 4 1 5 4 5 1 6 5 6 and t is at level t in the bruhat lattice further the inverse descent set for t is the set of the final i 1 generators by corollary 3 7 of 13 the generating function for the sizes of the levels in the down set of t is given by n n 1 n i 1 n i j where i and j are as defined in equation 9 by theorem 3 1 of 13 this implies that generating function of the levels in the upset of t is fn t x n i n i j 1 n i j 2 2 1 for example with n 4 and t 4 see figure 1 we have 4 4132 i 1 and j 1 this yields the generating functions 4 2 1 2 x 2 x 2 2 x 3 x 4 for its downset and f 4 4 x 3 1 x x 2 for its upset the inverse descent set of t is very small this means that there are many dif ferent permutations of a given rank with an inverse descent set that contains inv t we conjecture that t is a rank t permutation with the maximum number of rank r permutations in its upset 18 conjecture 6 2 let 1 t r n 2 if n is sufficiently large relative to t and r then the set br n is t ekr in particular ft r n up p br n which equals the coefficient of xr t in fn t x finally we note that the question of t intersection for any t n can also be considered for the entire poset in the case of the subsets poset the largest t intersecting sets are given by katona s theorem 10 the theorem states that the largest such set is roughly the collection of all set with size greater than n t 2 at present it is not clear to us what the case will be for the bruhat poset two possible candidates for largest t intersecting family are the set of all permutations with at least n t 2 inverse descents and up t this is the set of all permutations that have a common set of size t in their inverse descent set question 6 3 what is the size and structure of the largest t intersecting permutations in b n acknowledgment karen meagher s research is
