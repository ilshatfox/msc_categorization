error of the prime number theorem keywords the prime number theorem average error riemann s zeta function residue theorem 1 introduction the functions x x x n are the familiar ones in the number theory 1 log if is a power of prime number 0 otherwise log p x n x p x x p n p n x n x p where variable p in the sums are of prime numbers the prime number theorems are the ones to describe the distribution rule of prime numbers there are mainly the following three equivalent versions i log or li ii iii x x x x x x x x 1 1 that is logx x x x are the dominant parts of functions x x and x respectively when x is sufficient great so the rest work is to determine the error parts in the paper we are merely in regard to the version iii let r x x x de la vall e poussin proved that exp logr x

error 1 n x r x r n x in this paper we will give some estimation the argument is essentially an extension of perron formula theorem 1 suppose that is the set of non trivial zeros of riemann s zeta function s 1 4 max re im logx x then r x x 1 4 in general 2 5 3 5 1 5 exp 2 log log log r x x c x x 1 5 it should be mentioned that although the factor 6 5 log x in 1 3 actually may be assimilated into exp of its right hand in order to coincide with the one in 1 5 we have preserved it 2 the proofs of theorems 1 lemma 1 for 0 b t it has 1 2 3 1 1 if 1 1 if 0 1 2 1 1 if 1 s b it b it a r a a ds r
