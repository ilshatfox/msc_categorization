open problems 2 introduction the bivariate tutte polynomial t g x y for graphs and matroids introduced in 1954 by w t tutte arose from attempts to generalize the chromatic polyno mial introduced by g birkhoff in 1912 6 83 the tutte polynomial lived a life in the shadows of mainstream mathematics until it entered center stage via the discovery in 52 that the jones polynomial for knots and links was an incarna tion of the tutte polynomial for alternating link diagrams for the connection between the tutte polynomial and knot theory see chapter 13 s huggett since then numerous papers have investigated amazing properties of the tutte polynomial and its generalization to signed graphs and more generally to edge colored graphs see chapter 1 j ellis monaghan and i moffatt chapter 18 l traldi and for its history chapter 29 g farr when evaluating the tutte polynomial we look at problem of computing the exact value of t g x 0 y 0 where the input is a graph g and two elements x 0 y 0 c one could alternatively also ask for the list of all coefficients of t g x 0 y 0 or more modestly for the sign of t g x 0 y 0 when x 0 y 0 r if we can evaluate efficiently we can use interpolation to compute the coefficients see 53 for a detailed discussion surprisingly m jerrum and l goldberg showed in 42 that even computing the sign of t g x 0 y 0 can be very hard in this chapter we concentrate on the complexity of exactly evaluating the tutte polynomial and its relatives as a function of the order of the graph g 3 approximate computation of the tutte polynomial is treated in chapter 26 bordewich the landmark paper initiating the study of the complexity of t g x y is 53 this paper sets the paradigm for further investigations it studies the complexity of the problem given a graph g as input to compute the value of all the coefficients of the polynomial t g x y the question is stated and answered in the turing model of computation and the complexity class suitable to capture the most difficult cases is p which was introduced by valiant in 84 in the course of the chapter it is observed that the results can be extended to any subfield of c the elements of which can be represented is finite binary strings the main result of 53 states that for almost all pairs x 0 y 0 c the problem is p complete and the set for which it is not p complete the exception set is given explicitly as a semialgebraic set of lower dimension we shall discuss this result in detail in section 4 1 3 background i in this section we collect some background material needed for discussing the complexity of the tutte polynomial for graphs further background for the case of matroids follows in section 5 3 1 complexity classes background on complexity in the turing model of computation can be found in 56 75 79 43 3 and for valiant style algebraic complexity in 21 for complexity over the reals and complex numbers we refer to 14 and for quantum computing we refer to 44 70 for parameterized complexity we refer the reader to 34 29 30 27 37 informally a decision problem is a computational problem for which the answer is either yes or no e g given a graph g is there a proper r coloring of it a counting problem is a computational problem for which the answer is the number of satisfying configurations e g given a graph g how many proper r colorings does it have we denote by p respectively fp the set of decision problems counting problems which can be solved in time polynomial in the size of the input problems which belong to p or to fp are called tractable and are considered to be efficiently computable we denote by np the set of decision problems for which it is possible to verify whether a given configuration is correct in polynomial time in the size of the input we denote by p pronounced number p the set of counting prob lems which count configurations whose correctness can be verified in polynomial time for example the problem of deciding whether a graph is r colorable is in np and computing the number of r colorings is in p whether p np and whether fp p are famous and notoriously difficult open questions in theoretical computer science a problem x is np hard p hard if using it as an oracle allows one to solve any problem in np respectively in p in polyno mial time problems which are np hard or p hard are provably the hardest 4 problems in np respectively p and are are considered intractable they are not considered effectively computable unless np p respectively p fp so far the complexity of computational problems was measured with respect to one parameter of the input only the size of the input e g the number of vertices or edges of the input graph parameterized complexity measures the complexity of problems in terms of additional parameters of the graph a problem is fixed parameter tractable with respect to a parameter k if there is a computable function f a polynomial p and an algorithm solving the problem in time f k p n where n is the size of the problem and the function f k does only depend on k however f may grow arbitrarily in k and indeed is often exponential in k the set of fixed parameter tractable decision problems is denoted by fpt 3 2 structural graph parameters tree width and clique width are graph parameters which measure the compo sitionality of a graph tree width is usually defined as the minimum width of a certain map of a graph into a tree called a tree decomposition in contrast graphs of clique width k are defined inductively for uniformity of presentation we also give an inductive definition of graphs of tree width k the various notions of graph width have had a large impact on the study of efficient algorithms for graph problems 49 due to the inductive definitions of graphs of bounded tree width and clique width problems which are np hard or p hard on general graphs are often fixed parameter tractable with respect to tree width or clique width 23 24 some of the techniques used to compute the tutte polynomial on graphs of bounded tree width may also be found in chapter 26 c merino let k 1 k a k graph is a graph g v e together with a partition r r 1 rk of v the sets ri are called labels of g and r is a labeling the classes tw k and cw k of k graphs are defined inductively below a graph has tree width clique width k if k is the minimal value such that there is a labeling r of g for which g r tw k respectively in g r cw k definition 1 tree width the class tw k of graphs of tree width at most k is defined inductively as follows all k 1 graphs of order at most k 1 belong to tw k tw k is closed under the following operations i disjoint union t ii renaming of labels i j all vertices in ri are moved to rj iii fusion fusei all vertices in ri are contracted into a single vertex tw g the tree width of g denotes the smallest k such that g tw k 5 all trees have tree width 1 and all cycles have tree width 2 a clique of size k has tree width k 1 definition 2 clique width the class cw k of graphs of clique width at most k is defined inductively as follows all k graphs of order 1 belong to cw k cw k is closed under the following operations i disjoint union t ii renaming of labels i j iii edge addition i j all possible undirected edges are added between ri and rj cw g the clique width of g denotes the smallest k such that g cw k every graph of tree width at most k has clique width at most 2 k 1 1 cf 25 while there are classes of graphs of bounded clique width which have unbounded tree width such as cliques clique width 1 or complete bipartite graphs clique width 2 logarithmic clique width is defined similarly to clique width with the exception that r 1 rk are no longer required to be disjoint every graph of tree width at most k has logarithmic clique width at most k 2 a graph g v e of tree width k has at most k v edges while a graph of clique width k can have the maximal number of edges of a loop free undirected graph v 2 a tw k expression is a term t consisting of base elements and operations which witnesses that a k graph belongs to tw k cw k a cw k expression is defined correspondingly computing the exact tree width or the exact clique width of a graph is np hard however computing a tw k expression is fixed parameter tractable in k due to the fixed parameter tractabil ity of computing a tree decomposition 16 for clique width the computation of an exponential upper bound k on the clique width k of a graph and a cw k expression for the graph is fixed parameter tractable 73 other notions of widths of graphs are studied in the literature a survey is given in 49 among these we have bw g the branch width of g which is related to tree width and rw g the rank width of g which is related to clique width more precisely theorem 3 i bw g tw g 1 b 3 2 bw g c 76 ii rw g cw g 21 rw g 1 73 among these notions of width only branch width generalizes to matroids see section 5 5 6 4 the exact complexity of the tutte polynomial on graphs 4 1 the main paradigm a dichotomy theorem the natural basic computational task associated with the tutte polynomial is to compute for a given graph g the table of coefficients of t g x y however this task is p hard since the number 1 r e 3 k g t g 2 0 of proper 3 colorings of g is p hard and the prefactor 1 r e 3 k g is polynomial time computable in particular the evaluation 2 0 of the tutte polynomial is p hard f jaeger d vertigan and d welsh began the study of the complexity of the tutte polynomial in their classic paper 53 they studied the problem of computing the tutte polynomial on input a graph g at a fixed point a b c 2 in the complex plane the main result of 53 is a dichotomy theorem a theorem which classifies the complexity of evaluations a b of the tutte polynomial into tractable or p hard technically the complexity is measured in an extension field of the rational numbers containing a and b let h 1 be the hyperbola h 1 x y c 2 x 1 y 1 1 theorem 4 f jaeger d vertigan and d welsh 53 let g be a graph and let h be the union of h 1 with 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 i i i i j j 2 j 2 j where j e 2 i 3 for every a b c 2 1 if a b 6 h then t g a b is p hard 2 if a b h then t g a b is computable in polynomial time see figure 1 for a plot of the r 2 part of the tutte plane 4 2 planar and bipartite planar graphs the method of kasteleyn 57 for tractable computation of the ising partition function on planar graphs carries over to the tutte polynomial theorem 5 p kastelyn 57 for planar graphs evaluating the tutte poly nomial on the hyperbola h 2 x 1 y 1 2 is in p otherwise points which are p hard on general graphs remain p hard even on bipartite planar graphs 7 figure 1 t g x y is polynomial time computable on the hyperbola x 1 y 1 1 and the points 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 otherwise it is p hard figure 2 t g x y is polynomial time computable on the hyperbolas x 1 y 1 1 2 and the points 1 1 1 1 for bipartite planar graphs otherwise it is p hard jaeger and welsh studied the complexity of evaluating the tutte polynomial on the class of graphs which are both bipartite and planar theorem 6 d vertigan and d welsh 88 87 let hb p be the union of h 1 h 2 and 1 1 1 1 j j j j for every a b c 2 1 if a b 6 hb p then t g a b is p hard for bipartite planar graphs 2 if a b hb p then t g a b is computable in polynomial time for bi partite planar graphs see figure 2 for a plot of the tutte plane for bipartite planar graphs 4 3 graphs of bounded tree width and clique width the tutte polynomial and variants of it are efficiently computable on graphs of bounded tree width or clique width j oxley and d welsh initiated the study of the complexity of evaluating the tutte polynomial on graph classes of bounded width 74 however their notion of width is more restricted than tree width but does include the series parallel graphs which are of tree width 2 the first general results on the 8 computation of the tutte polynomial on graphs of bounded tree width were obtained independently by a andrzejak 1 and s noble 71 they proved that for every fixed evaluation a b of t g x y there an algorithm which computes t g a b using a linear number of arithmetic operations theorem 7 a andrzejak 1 s noble 71 t g x y can be evaluated in linear time in v on graphs with bounded tree width in fact t g x y is fixed parameter tractable with respect to tree width analogues of theorem 7 for variants of the tutte polynomial are given below the coefficients of the tutte polynomial and its variants can be computed in polynomial time on graphs of bounded tree width in the case of t g x y the list of coefficients can be computed in time o v 3 by evaluating t g x y at sufficiently many points to interpolate it there is a matching cubic lower bound for the computation of all the coefficients 71 the result 1 and 71 has a wide generalization based on logical techniques which covers colored versions of the tutte polynomial the jones polynomial in knot theory and many other graph polynomials which can be defined in monadic second order logic t zaslavsky 90 91 defined a generalization of the tutte polynomial with an edge coloring function c e called the the signed tutte polynomial for graphs and normal function of the colored matroid 1 respectively this was rediscovered by bolloba s and riordan 18 as colored versions of the tutte polynomial theorem 8 i averbouch b godlin and j makowsky 4 63 i evaluating the tutte polynomial for signed graphs and normal function of a colored graph is fixed parameter tractable with respect to tree width 4 ii let be a finite set evaluating the colored tutte polynomial tcolored g c x y x y for colored graphs g c with c e is fixed parameter tractable with respect to tree width 63 similar theorems stated for knot diagrams rather than graphs can be found in 64 a detailed discussion of the signed and colored tutte polynomials can be found in chapter 17 1 the jones polynomial and other relatives of the tutte polynomial and their application to knot theory are discussed in chapter nn x yyy the complexity of the algorithms given in 63 and 4 is asymptotically the same as in 1 and 71 however the runtimes of the algorithms given in 63 and 4 work also for the signed or colored tutte polynomials but involve very large constants due to the generality of the logical methods involved which make them 1 we discuss the complexity of the tutte polynomial on matroids in section 6 9 impractical the algorithms given in 1 and 71 give workable upper bounds but do not work for the signed or colored tutte polynomials a more efficient algorithm for the colored tutte polynomial was given in 82 based on 1 finally noble in 72 extended his approach to a further generalization of the tutte polynomial the weighted graph polynomial u he showed that evaluating the weighted graph polynomial u g x y is also fixed parameter tractable with respect to tree width on graphs of bounded clique width the tutte polynomial can be computed in subexponential time however unlike the case of tree width t g x y is unlikely to be fixed parameter tractable with respect to clique width theorem 9 o gime nez p hline ny and m noy 40 t g x y can be computed in time exp o v 1 1 k 2 on graphs of clique width at most k theorem 10 f fomin p golovach d lokoshtanov and s saurabh 35 36 given a graph g and r n deciding whether g r 6 0 is not fixed parameter tractable with respect to clique width under the complexity theoretic assumption fpt 6 w 1 in particular this shows that the same applies to evaluating the chromatic polynomial the chromatic polynomial however is polynomial time computable if the clique width is fixed theorem 11 j makowsky u rotics i averbouch and b godlin 66 the chromatic polynomial g can be computed in time o v f k on graphs of clique width at most k where f k o 2 k is a function depending only on k it is open whether theorem 9 can be improved to match the bound for the chromatic polynomial given in theorem 11 we summarize the results of sections 4 1 4 3 in table 1 4 4 exact computation of the t g x y on small graphs computing the tutte polynomial on large graphs is a major challenge the deleting contraction reduction formula of the tutte polynomial gives a naive algorithm for com puting the list of coefficients of the tutte polynomial whose runtime is exponential in the number of edges of the graph sekine imai and tani 78 gave an algorithm com puting the tutte polynomial of a planar graph of order n whose runtime is o 2 o n bjo rklund et al 7 gave an algorithm for general graphs which is exponential in the number of vertices and uses polynomial space haggard pearce and royle 45 imple mented an algorithm which exploits isomorphisms in the computation tree to allow more efficient computation of the tutte polynomial and used it disprove a conjecture by welsh on the roots of the tutte polynomial see chapter xx for more details 10 graph class p hard

vertex exponential algorithm of 7 under the assumption that there is no subexponential algorithm for the num ber of proper 3 colorings this assumption is called the counting exponential time

subex ponential in e log 3 e on simple graphs 5 background ii matroids were introduced in chapter 8 j oxley and further discussed in chapter 11 e gioan for convenience of the reader we repeat some of the basic definitions here a matroid is an ordered pair e c consisting of a finite set e called the ground set and a set c of subsets of e called the circuits which satisfy the following conditions c 1 6 c c 2 if c 1 c 2 c and c 1 c 2 then c 1 c 2 c 3 if c 1 c 2 c c 1 6 c 2 and e c 1 c 2 then there is c 3 c such that c 3 c 1 c 2 e matroids have many equivalent definitions cf 89 46 or chapter 8 section 4 j oxley instead of c one can consider i the independent sets s the spanning sets f the flats b the bases h the hyperplanes other definitions use a closure operator on the subsets of e a rank function or a girth function all these definitions of matroids are equivalent from an axiomatic point of view but differ from an algorithmic point of view cf 46 67 for convenience we repeat here also the definition of a matroid via a rank function from chapter 8 chapter 8 j oxley let e a finite set a function r 2 e z is a rank function if it satisfies the following conditions r 1 if x e then 0 r x x r 2 if x y e then r x r y r 3 if x y e then r x r y r x y r x y for a e a r a is called the corank or nullity of a a nonempty set a e is a circuit if r a a 1 and for every e e we have that r a e r a here is another equivalent definition of matroids using a girth function cf 46 it is introduced here because we will discuss its computational power as a matroid oracle in theorem 15 let e a finite set a function g 2 e n is a girth function if it satisfies the following conditions for all x y e and x e 12 g 1 if g x there is y x with g x g y y g 2 if x y e then g x g y g 3 if g x x g y y x 6 y and x x y then g x y x in all the definitions of matroids there is an exponential gap between the size of the underlying set e and the information needed to capture the properties of the family of subsets the closure operation the rank function or the girth function defining the ma troid in order to develop a complexity theory for matroid problems three approaches are used matroid oracle computations the restriction to matroids with succinct pre sentations and using the full listing of the family of subsets circuits independent sets etc or the functions on the subsets of the ground sets rank function closure opera tion etc pioneering papers for the first two approaches are 31 32 17 77 46 54 more recent discussions can be found in 67 80 5 1 succinct presentation of matroids let a be a class of matroids closed under matroid isomorphisms and be the finite words over a finite alphabet let w denote the length of w and an the class of matroids in a with ground set 1 n n of size n a class of matroids has a succinct description or is succinct if there is an injective mapping e a and a polynomial p n x such that for each m an we have that e m p n it is easy to see that a is succinct iff an o 2 q n for some q n x examples 13 i the graphic matroids are succinct using the underlying graph as their description ii the binary matroids are succinct the same is true for the matroids which can be represented over any finite field iii the regular matroids are the matroids which are representable over every field hence they form a succinct class of matroids cf chapter 8 theorem 8 16 if m is regular so is its dual graphical matroids are regular iv transversal matroids defined in oxley s chapter 8 are representable over suffi ciently large finite fields hence they form a succinct class of matroids cf 19 theorem 2 5 special cases of transversal matroids are a the class of bicircular matroids given a graph g its bicircular matroid b g is given by e e g and its independent sets are the edge sets in which each connected component contains at most one cycle b the class of lattice path matroids a lattice path matroid is a transversal matroid that has a presentation by a collection of intervals in the ground set relative to some fixed linear order such that no interval contains another cf 19 section 4 2 in this chapter complexity results are always formulated for succinct classes of ma troids the uniform matroid ur n has an underlying set e with n elements and its basis consists of all the subsets of e with exactly r elements the uniform matroids are succinct we assume the reader is familiar with the following operations on matroids 13 cf chapter 8 j oxley let m n be two matroids and e f be an edge of m and n respectively i m e is the matroid obtained from m by deleting e ii m e is the matroid obtained from m by contracting e iii m te f n is the 2 sum of m and n iv m n is the tensor product of m and n here n is a pointed matroid with distinguished edge d in the case n is a uniform matroid ur n the result is independent of the choice of d in ur n let m be an arbitrary matroid the k stretch sk m is defined as sk m m uk k 1 and the k thickening tk m is defined as sk m m u 1 k 1 definition 14 53 86 i a class of matroids c is closed under expansions if it is closed under sk m and ts m for every k n ii c is expand succinct or a jvw class if it is succinct and sk m and tk m can be constructed in polynomial time for each m c typical jvw classes are the graphic matroids the regular matroids and matroids representable over a fixed finite field the class of transversal matroids is not a jvw class it is closed under deletion but not under contraction cf section 8 7 in chapter 8 5 2 matroid oracles matroid oracles are used to show that most matroid properties are hard to compute for general matroids cf 77 54 this is largely due to the fact that the number of matroids with underlying set e of size n is doubly exponential in n oracles may vary cf 46 but the most widely used is the independence oracle which takes as its input a set of matroid elements and returns as output a boolean value true if the given set is independent and false otherwise naturally every one of the nine axiomatic definitions of matroids independent basis circuit spanning flat hyperplane rank girth and closure gives rise to an oracle the oracles return boolean values also for basis sets circuits spanning sets flats and hyperplanes in the case of the rank or girth function the oracle returns an element of 0 1 e and in the case of the closure a subset of e the computational strength of the different oracles can be compared by polynomial time simulation let o 1 o 2 be two oracles of matroids on a ground set e we say that o 1 is polynomially reducible to o 2 denoted by o 1 o 2 iff one call in o 1 can be simulated by at most polynomially many calls on o 2 theorem 15 d hausmann and b korte 46 under the partial order of poly nomial reducibility we have i basis circuit flat hyperplane are incomparable and weaker as or acles than rank ii rank independent spanning and closure polynomially bi reducible iii girth is strictly stronger than all the other oracles many natural matroid parameters are hard to compute 54 14 theorem 16 the following are not polynomial time computable using the independent oracle i decide whether m is uniform self dual orientable bipartite eulerian or repre sentable ii compute the girth or the connectivity of m iii count the number of circuits bases hyperplanes or flats of m however to the best of our knowledge there are no papers studying the degrees of computability for oracle computations on matroids 5 3 full presentations of matroids a matroid is essentially a finite set with a structured family of subsets which can be described explicitly this approach has originally not been studied because the input for a turing machine was considered too large if the size of the matroid should be polynomial in the size of the cardinality of the ground set e it was suspected that this would make most if not all computational matroid problems solvable in polynomial time in the size of its true input however d mayhew analyzed the situation carefully 67 by comparing the various input sizes of rank independent spanning basis circuit flat and hyperplane suppose that input 1 and input 2 are two methods for describing a matroid m then input 1 input 2 iff there exists a polynomial time turing machine which will produce for every matroid m the presentation m input 2 given the presentation m input 1 we write input 1 input 2 iff it is not the case that input 2 input 1 surprisingly comparing input modes gives a different picture than comparing matroid oracles theorem 17 d mayhem 67 under the partial ordering of we have i rank independent and rank spanning furthermore independent and spanning are incomparable ii spanning basis circuit and basis hyperplanes further more circuits and hyperplanes are incomparable iii independent flats hyperplanes and independent basis furthermore basis and flats are incomparable 5 4 comparing notions of matroid computability for succinct presentations of matroids decision and counting problems can be found in most time complexity classes between polynomial time and exponential time because this includes graph matroids complexity results for matroid oracle are usually of the form there exists no polynomial oracle algorithm for computing problem in 46 twenty problems are listed for which this is true for independent among them also the problem of computing the tutte polynomial for arbitrary matroids it remains open how to work out the details needed to refine complexity results for matroid oracles analogue to the case of succinct presentations for which problems is there an analogue to np completeness or p completeness in the oracle setting 15 finally in the case of full descriptions of the matroids it is not the case that as one might naively suspect that all natural problems are in p the situation is well illustrated by the following problem problem 3 matroid intersection 3 mi instance an integer k and three matroids mi input 1 i 3 over the same ground set e question does there exist a set a e such that a k and a is independent in each mi theorem 18 d mayhem 67 i if circuits input or hyperplanes input then 3 mi is np complete ii if input basis then 3 mi is in p to the best of our knowledge the complexity of the tutte polynomial has not been established in the full description framework 5 5 matroid width j oxley and d welsh in 74 introduce a very restriced notion of matroid width a class of matroids m has ow width k if a largest 3 connected member of m has a groundset of k elements they show that under some stronger assumption than suc cinct representability evaluating the tutte polynomial on matroid classes of bounded ow width a in fpt we shall not persue this further a branch decomposition of a matroid m with ground set e and rank function r is a tree t such that i all inner nodes of t have degree three and ii the leaves of t are in one one correspondence with e an edge e of t splits t into two subtrees with leaves corresponding to e 1 e and e 2 e which partition e the width of e is defined by r e 1 e r e 2 e r e 1 the width of the branch decomposition t is the maximum width of an edge of t finally the branch width of m is the minimum width of the branch decompositions of m and is denoted by bw m we collect some basic facts listed in the survey paper 49 theorem 19 i the branch width of a bridgeless graph every edge is contained in a cycle equals the branch width of its cycle matroid ii given a matroid m with n elements and a positive integer k it is possible to test using an independent oracle in polynomial time with the degree depending on k whether bw m k iii for matroids m representable over a fixed finite field deciding whether bw m k is in fpt fixed parameter tractable if so then the same algorithm also outputs a branch decomposition of m of width at most 3 k although testing whether bw m k is easy to check in the oracle framework appli cations usually require that the matroid be representable which is hard by theorem 16 16 to remedy this other notions of matroid width were recently introduced decom position width in 60 and amalgam width in 62 without going into details we note that matroids of decomposition width dw m k amalgam width aw m k can be represeted by a decomposition tree amalgam tree although this tree is not known to be computable in polynomial time however if the decomposition or amalgam tree is given together with m and is of width k then many parameters can be computed in polynomial time using the independent oracle 60 62 we also note that for matroids m representable by a finite field f and branch width bw m k both dw m and aw m are bounded by functions which depend on k and the size of f 6 the exact complexity of the tutte polynomial for matroids the paper 53 was the first to analyze the complexity of evaluating the tutte polyno mial for pairs of algebraic numbers x 0 y 0 a also for matroids the tutte polynomial of a graphic matroid m g is the same as the tutte polynomial of g so here we only discuss classes of non graphic matroids 6 1 succinct presentations for the case of a class c matroids the analogue of theorem 4 uses two assumptions on the class c which are trivially satisfied for the class g of all graphic matroids we have introduced these assumptions in section 5 to define a jvw class of matroids a jvw class has to be succinct closed under k stretching and k thickening for all k n the operations of stretching and thickening have to be computable in polynomial time theorem 20 f jaeger d vertigan and d welsh 53 let c be jvw class of matroids and m c then evaluating t m a b is p hard on all points a b 6 h if a b h then t m a b is computable in polynomial time here h is the same as in theorem 4 the class of transversal matroids t is succinct cf example 13 however it is not a jvw class we still have the following dichotomy theorem 21 c colbourn j provan and d vertigan 22 for the class of transversal matroids m t the evaluation the tutte polynomial t m x 0 y 0 is p hard for all x 0 y 0 a unless x 0 1 y 0 1 0 in which case it is in p to prove this theorem the authors replace the operations k stretching and k thickening used in the proof of theorem 20 by operations k expansion and k augmentation which preserve transversality a bicircular matroid of a graph g is the matroid b g whose points are the edges of g and whose independent sets are the edge sets of pseudoforests of g that is the edge sets in which each connected component contains at most one cycle the class b of bicircular matroids is contained in the class t of transversal matroids which unlike transversal matroids is closed under minors a bicircular matroid b b g is determined by its underlying graph g but it need not be graphic the k stretching of a bicircular matroid b denoted by sk b can be shown to be b sk g hence bicircular matroids are closed under k stretching however they are not closed under k thickening 17 theorem 22 41 for a matroid m b the evaluation of the tutte polynomial t m x y is p hard for all x 0 y 0 a unless x 0 1 y 0 1 0 for x 0 0 and x 0 1 the complexity has not yet been determined proposition 23 41 for the complete graph kn and the bicircular matroid m b kn b the evaluation of the tutte polynomial t m x 0 y 0 is in p a further special case of transversal matroids is the class of the lattice path matroids lp they are obtained from the lattice with vertices in i j n 2 with 0 i m and 0 j r with steps east and north let p and q be two paths in this lattice the lattice paths that go from 0 0 to m r and that remain in the region bounded by p and q can be identified with the bases of a particular type of transversal matroid 20 theorem 24 69 for lattice path matroids m lp the evaluation of the tutte polynomial t m x 0 y 0 is in p 6 2 matroid oracles the situation for matroids which have no succinct presentation the situation is less understood we summarize here what is known about the computability of the tutte polynomial when the matroid is given by an oracle theorem 25 let m be a matroid of size n and rank r using the independent oracle we have i the tutte polynomial m is not computable in polynomial time 54 ii if the the matroid m has branch width bw m k and is representable over a finite field f then t m x y is computable in time o n 6 log n log log n even without the oracle 48 iii if m has decomposition width dw m k and is given with its decomposition tree then t m x y is computable in time o k 2 n 3 r 2 and evaluated in time o k 2 n under the assumption of unit cost of the arithmetic operations 60 iv if m has amalgam width aw m k and is given with its amalgam tree then t m x y is computable in time o nd for some constant d independent of k 62 7 tutte polynomial in algebraic models of com putation the complexity of the tutte polynomial was also studied in various alternative models of computation 7 1 valiant s algebraic circuit model l valiant introduced in 85 an algebraic model of computation based on uniformly defined families of algebraic circuits and a notion of reducibility based on substitutions called p projections in this framework it is natural to consider multivariate versions 18 of graph polynomials see also see also chapter 18 traldi in this model there is analogue for polynomial time called vp and for non deterministic polynomial time called vnp computing the family of determinants detn of an n n matrix where the entries are treated as indeterminates is in vp computing the corresponding permanent pern is vnp complete the major problem in valiant s framework is the question whether vp vnp a detailed development of valiant s theory can be found in 21 typical families of functions in vnp are generating functions of graph properties these are polynomials depending on graphs with indeterminate weights on the edges let p be a graph property i e a class of finite graphs closed under isomorphisms for a graph g v g e g the generating function of a graph property is defined as gf g p e e v g e p e e xe the complexity of generating functions of graph properties in valiant s model was first studied by m jerrum in 55 and further developed by p bu rgisser in 21 the tutte polynomial of a graph has only two variables therefore it cannot be vnp complete in valiant s model in order to get a complete family of tutte poly nomials we have to put weights on the edges of the underlying graph this leads to a weighted tutte polynomial as defined in 81 or in 18 let g v g e g be a graph for each e e g we have four indeterminates xe ye xe ye fix an order on the edges e g the multivariate whitney rank generating function w gn xe ye xe ye is defined for connected graphs g by w gn xe ye xe ye t e g e t int act xe e e g t ext act ye e t int inact xe e e g t ext inact ye where the sum is over all spanning trees t and the condition of internal external active inactive is defined with respect to the order on e g for graphs not connected we add additional indeterminates traldi s dichromatic polynomial q g ve q z is defined by q g ve q z e e g q k e z e r e e e ve where k e is the number of connected components of the spanning subgraph induced by e and r e is its rank the complexity of the tutte polynomial in valiant s model was studied in 61 to get a meaningful complexity analysis the notion of p projections is modified to allow also a wider class of substitutions which the authors call polynomial oracle reductions not surprisingly they show that in this slightly modified framework of valiant s model the multivariate tutte polynomial is vnp complete more precisely theorem 26 61 1 there is a family of graphs gn such that the family of multivariate tutte polynomials w gn xe ye xe ye is vnp complete under p projections 2 traldi s dichromatic polynomial q g ve q z is vnp complete via polynomial oracle reductions for details the reader is referred to 61 50 19 7 2 the blum shub smale model in the early 1970 s computability over arbitrary first order structures was introduced independently in 33 38 by e engeler and h friedman what they propose is roughly speaking to use register machines over first order structures a where the registers contain elements of a and the tests and operations are defined by the re lations and functions of a their framework was rediscovered by l blum m shub and s smale in 15 see also 14 and 39 for a comparison between 38 and 15 they main merit of 15 is the introduction of a complexity theory for computability over the real and complex numbers which includes complexity classes pr for deter ministic polynomial time computable and npr for non deterministic polynomial time computable problems and the existence of npr complete problems where r is an arbitrary possibly ordered ring we call this model of computation the bss model of computation later k meer 68 introduced also a complexity class pr for the bss model of computation as it is customary to look at the tutte polynomial t g x y as a polynomial in r x y or c x y and graphs can be viewed as 0 1 matrices the complexity of the tutte polynomial is most naturally discussed in the bss model of computation 65 however the theory of counting complexity in the bss model of computation has various drawbacks in particular there is no satisfactory theory for pr complete problems furthermore it is not clear whether and it seems unlikely that evaluating the chromatic polynomial at the point x 3 is npr complete a detailed description of these problems can be found in 58 59 where also an abstract algebraic version of the jvw theorem 4 is formulated in 2 the descriptive complexity of counting problems in the bss model of computation over r is also discussed using essentially the same framework as in 58 59 8 open problems the complexity of computing or evaluating the tutte polynomial in the turing model of computation in a ring r x y is well understood for graphs without restrictions on their presentations and for matroids provided the matroids have succinct presentations provided the arithmetic operations in the ring r are polynomial time computable in some standard presentation of r the same is true for special classes of graphs planar bipartite etc and special succinct classes of matroids transversal bicircular etc for graph classes of bounded tree width evaluating the tutte polynomial is fixed parameter tractable however for graph classes of bounded clique width the situation is not completely understood problem 1 determine the complexity of evaluating the tutte polynomial for graphs of fixed clique width planar graphs are a special cases of a minor closed class of graphs problem 2 determine the complexity of evaluating the tutte polynomial for other minor closed graph classes the jvw theorem 4 and its variations show a dichotomy the difficult point property dpp evaluation of the tutte polynomial at fixed evaluation points is 20 p hard on all points in r 2 a where a r 2 is a semialgebraic quasialgebraic set of dimension 1 versions of dpp have been proven also for many other graph polynomials e g the bolloba s riordan version of the tutte polynomial 10 11 the interlace polynomial 12 13 the cover polynomial for directed graphs 8 9 the bivariate matching polynomial for multi graphs defined first in 47 in 5 51 and many more which are surveyed in 59 problem 3 characterize the graph polynomials for which dpp holds if one studies the complexity in the turing model of computation the real or complex numbers have no recursive presentation moreover the recursive presentaions of the countable subrings which do have a recursive presentation are not uniform this makes the statement about the complexity over the reals or complex numbers somehow artificial in the bss model of computation cf 59 this problem of non uniformity does not arise problem 4 refine the complexity analysis of the tutte polynomial in the bss model of computation in the case of matroids without succinct presentation it is known that the tutte polynomial is not polynomial time computable using the the independent oracle theorem 25 but to the best of our knowledge the analogues of np completeness or higher levels of the complexity hierarchy within exponential time oracle computability of matroids has not been developed problem 5 develop a coherent theory of complexity for computations with matroid oracles in general references 1 a andrzejak an algorithm for the tutte
