cells t in each column filled with a certain set of numbers that is symmetric about the number zero such that every row and column has a zero sum we use the notation sma m n if m t and n s in this paper we prove that for every even number n 2 there exists an sma m n such that the entries x appear in the same row for every x 1 2 3 mn 2 if and only if m 0 3 mod 4 and n 2 or m 3 and n 4 keywords magic array heffter array signed magic array shiftable array 1 introduction an integer heffter array h m n s t is an m n array with entries from x 1 2 ms such that each row contains s filled cells and each column contains t filled cells the elements in every row and column sum to 0 in z and for every x x either x or x appears in the array the notion of an integer heffter array h m n s t was first defined by archdeacon in 1 integer heffter arrays with m n represent a type of magic square where each number from the set 1 2 3 n 2 is used once up to sign a heffter array is tight if it has no empty cell that is n s and necessarily m t the proof of the following theorem can be found in 2 theorem 1 let m n be integers at least 3 there is a tight integer heffter array if and only if mn 0 3 mod 4

x 1 2 3 ms 2 if ms is even such that precisely s cells in every row and t cells in every column are filled every integer from set x appears exactly once in the array and the sum of each row and of each column is zero an sma m n s t is called tight and denoted sma m n if it contains no empty cells that is m t and necessarily n s figure 1 displays tight sma 3 2 sma 3 4 and sma 4 2 1 1 2 2 3 3 1 1 2 2 5 4 5 4 6 3 3 6 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 figure 1 an sma 3 2 sma 3 4 and sma 4 2 an sma m n s t is shiftable if it contains the same number of positive as negative entries in every column and in every row these arrays are called shiftable because they may be shifted to use different absolute values by increasing the absolute value of each entry by k we add k to each positive entry and k to each negative entry if the number of entries in a row is 2 this means that we add k k 0 to each row and the same argument applies to the columns thus when shifted the array retains the same row and column sums the proof of the following theorem can be found in 8 theorem 2 an sma m n exists precisely when m n 1 or when m 2 and n 0 3 mod 4 or when n 2 and m 0 3 mod 4 or when m n 2 corollary 3 let n 2 then there exists an sma m 2 such that the entries x are in the same row for every x 1 2 3 m if and only if m 0 3 mod 4 we also note that if a is an m n tight integer heffter array then the m 2 n array a a is an sma m 2 n with the property that the entries x appear in the same row for every x 1 2 mn for more information on signed magic arrays consult 5 6 7 8 in this paper we prove that for every even number n 2 there exists an sma m n such that the entries x appear in the same row for every x 1 2 3 mn 2 if and only if m 0 3 mod 4 and n 2 or m 3 and n 4 for simplicity we say an sma m n with n even has the required prop erty if the entries x appear in the same row for every x 1 2 3 mn 2 2 2 the case m and n are even theorem 4 let m n 4 and even then there exists a shiftable sma m n such that the entries x appear in the same row for every x 1 2 3 mn 2 proof proceed by strong induction first on n and then on m as the base case we provide arrays for m n 4 4 6 4 4 6 and 6 6 in figures 2 and 3 respectively now let m 4 6 and n be even and assume that there exists a shiftable sma m n 4 with the required property we may extend this array by adding four columns to create an m n array the empty m 4 array may be filled by a shifted copy of the sma 4 4 or sma 6 4 in figure 2 as the shifted copies each has a row and column sum of zero they do not change the row sums from the m n 4 array and the sums of the new columns will be zero as well moreover the shifted copies have the required property therefore a shiftable sma m n exists with the required property hence by strong induction on n a shiftable sma m n exists for m 4 6 and n 4 even such that every entries x appear in the same row for every x 1 2 3 mn 2 see figure 4 for an illustration now let m and n both be even and m n 4 assume that there exists a shiftable sma m 4 n with the required property we may extend this array by adding four rows to create an m n array the empty 4 n array may be filled by a shifted copy of a shiftable sma 4 n with the required property which exists by the above argument hence by strong induction on n a shiftable sma m n exists for m n 4 and even such that every entries x appear in the same row for every x 1 2 3 mn 2 1 1 5 5 2 2 6 6 3 3 7 7 4 4 8 8 2 2 6 6 4 4 8 8 1 1 12 12 3 3 9 9 5 5 10 10 7 7 11 11 figure 2 ssma 4 4 and ssma 6 4 with the required property 3 1 1 5 5 9 9 2 2

obtained by construc tions given in theorem 4 3 the case m odd and n even since the structure of the sma 3 n given below is crucial in our construc tions we include the proof of this lemma here which can also be found in 8 lemma 5 let n be even then there exists an sma 3 n with the prop erty that the entries x appear in the same row for every x 1 2 3 3 n 2 proof an sma 3 2 and an sma 3 4 are given in figure 1 now let n 2 k 6 and pj j 2 for 1 j 2 k define a 3 n array a ai j as follows for 1 j 2 k a 1 j 3 pj 2 2 j 0 mod 4 3 pj 1 2 j 1 mod 4 3 pj 1 2 j 2 mod 4 3 pj 2 2 j 3 mod 4 for the third row we define a 3 1 3 k a 3 2 k 3 k and when 2 j 2 k 1 4 a 3 j 3 k pj j 0 mod 4 3 k pj 1 j 1 mod 4 3 k pj j 2 mod 4 3 k pj 1 j 3 mod 4 finally a 2 j a 1 j a 3 j for 1 j 2 k it is straightforward to see that array a is an sma 3 n with the property that the entries x appear in the same row for every x 1 2 3 5 n 2 figure 7 in appendix 1 displays an sma 3 12 constructed by above method lemma 6 let n 4 and even then there exists an sma 5 n with the property that the entries x appear in the same row for every entry x 1 2 3 5 n 2 proof we consider two cases case 1 n 0 mod 4 let a be an sma 3 n constructed by lemma 5 by construction the entries in row one of a are 3 i 1 3 i 2 0 i n 4 4 see figure 7 in appendix 1 switch 3 i 1 with 3 i 2 and 3 i 1 with 3 i 2 for 0 i n 4 4 to obtain the 3 n array b see figure 8 in appendix 1 note that the row sum is still zero in b and the column sums consists of n 2 ones and n 2 negative ones we now extend array b by adding two rows to create a 5 n array c the empty 2 n array may be filled by members of 3 n 2 j 1 j n such that the row sum and column sum of the resulting 5 n array are zero see figure 9 in appendix 1 case 2 n 2 mod 4 figure 5 displays an sma 5 6 with the required property now let n 10 and let a be an sma 3 n constructed by lemma 5 by construction the numbers in row one of a are 3 i 1 3 i 2 0 i n 6 4 3 n 2 4 see figure 10 in appendix 2 in row one of a switch 3 i 1 with 3 i 2 and 3 i 1 with 3 i 2 for 0 i n 10 4 and switch 3 n 6 4 1 with 3 n 6 4 2 note that we switch every entries in row one except the entries in columns n 5 n 2 n 1 and n now we switch the entries in row two and columns n 5 n 2 n 1 and n as follows switch 3 n 2 4 with 3 n 10 4 and 3 n 2 4 with 3 n 10 4 to obtain the 3 10 array b see figure 11 in appendix 2 5 note that the row sum is still zero in b and the column sums consists of n 4 2 ones n 4 2 negative ones 2 twos and 2 negative twos we now extend array b by adding two rows to create a 5 n array the empty 2 n array may be filled by members of 3 n 2 j 1 j n such that the row sum and column sum of the resulting 5 n array say c are zero see figure 12 in appendix 2 theorem 7 let m 3 be odd and n be even there exists an sma m n such that x appear in the same row for x 1 2 mn 2 if and only if m 0 3 mod 4 and n 2 or m 3 and n 4 proof for n 2 we apply corollary 3 now let m 3 and n 4 we consider two cases case 1 m 3 mod 4 by lemma 5 the statement is true for m 3 let m 7 and let a be an sma 3 n constructed in lemma 5 we extend array a by adding m 3 rows to create an m n array the empty m 3 n array may be filled by a shifted copy of the sma m 3 n given by theorem 4 as the shifted copies each have a row and column sum of zero they do not change the row sums from the 3 n array and the sums of the new columns will be zero as well moreover the shifted copies have the required property therefore an sma m n exists with the property that the entries x appear in the same row for every x 1 2 3 mn 2 case 2 m 1 mod 4 by lemma 6 the statement is true for m 5 now let m 9 and let a be an sma 5 n constructed in lemma 6 we extend array a by adding m 5 rows to create an m n array the empty m 5 n array may be filled by a shifted copy of the sma m 5 n given by theorem 4 as the shifted copies each have a row and column sum of zero they do not change the row sums from the 5 n array and the sums of the new columns will be zero as well moreover the shifted copies have have the required property therefore an sma m n exists with the property that the entries x appear in the same row
