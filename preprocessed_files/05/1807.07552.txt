realization spaces of uniform phased matroids amanda ruiz department of mathematics university of san diego san diego ca 92110 alruiz sandiego edu abstract a phased matroid is a matroid with additional structure which plays the same role for complex vector arrangements that oriented matroids play for real vector arrangements the realization space of an oriented resp phased matroid is the space of vector ar rangements in rn resp cn that correspond to oriented resp phased matroid modulo a change of coordinates according to mne v s universality theorem the realization spaces of uniform oriented matroids with rank greater than or equal to 3 can be as complicated as any open semi algebraic variety in contrast uniform phased matroids which are not essentially oriented have remarkably simple realization spaces if they are uniform we also present a criterion for realizability of uniform phased matroids that are not essentially oriented 1 introduction a matroid is a combinatorial object that abstracts the notion of linear independence in a vector configuration over an arbitrary field f oriented matroids are matroids with additional structure which encodes more geometric information than matroids by assigning to each ordered basis an element of 1 0 1 the theories of matroids and oriented matroids are major branches of combinatorics with applications in many fields of mathematics including topology algebra graph theory and geometry their contribution to mathematics motivates the question what is a complex matroid in fact ziegler wrote a paper with this title 11 several mathematicians have addressed the question posed by ziegler with varying answers in 11 ziegler proposed his own definition of a complex matroid his complex matroids are discrete objects with desirable characteristics consistent with being a generalization of oriented matroids but they lack a notion of cryptomorphisms an important characteristic of matroids and oriented matroids another approach to ziegler s question is to generalize oriented matroids by assigning to each ordered basis an element of the set s 1 0 in 7 dress and wenzel show that this non discrete approach corresponds to basis orientations over the fuzzy ring c r 0 of which s 1 0 is a subset phased matroids referred to as complex matroids in 1 3 are an answer developed by anderson and delucchi 1 growing out of work by below krummeck and richter gebert 3 1 ar x iv 1 80 7 07 55 2 v 1 m at h c o 1 9 ju l 20 18 and building on delucchi s diploma thesis 6 in 1 anderson and delucchi explore how much of the foundations of oriented matroids can be paralleled with the structure of the set s 1 0 they give a phased analog to the chirotope and circuit axioms of oriented matroids and show that the definitions are cryptomorphic a recent paper of baker and bowler 2 yet to appear as of the writing of this introduction generalizes oriented matroid and phased matroid properties into matroids over hyperfields proving the definitions are cryptomorphic on the hyperfield level and uniting the fields of oriented matroids phased matroids and matroids over hyperfields other than signs of real numbers and phases of complex number baker and bowler s paper is already expected to be important by allowing common properties of phased matroids and oriented matroids to be proven once on the hyperfield level in this paper we will focus on some of the differences between phased matroids and oriented matroids that can not be proven on at the hyperfield level but rely on the extra degree of freedom allowed over the complex numbers that is not allowed for over the real numbers some long term goals of phased matroid theory are to apply it to complex vector bundles and complex hyperplane arrangements in a way analogous to the applications of oriented matroids to real hyperplane arrangements and real vector bundles a celebrated theorem in oriented matroid theory is mne v s universality theorem 8 which describes how complicated the topology of realization spaces of oriented matroids including uniform oriented matroids can be an obvious question for phased matroid theory is how does the topology of realization spaces of phased matroids compare to that of oriented matroids this paper sets out to answer that question in the case of uniform phased matroids that are not essentially oriented surprisingly the realization spaces of uniform phased matroids that are not essentially oriented are remarkably simple in fact regardless of the rank of a uniform phased matroid with a groundset of size n if the phased matroid is not essentially oriented then the realization space is homeomorphic to rn 1 0 theorem 3 3 determining realizability of an oriented matroid is np hard 4 theorem 8 7 2 in contrast in theorem 6 3 we give a polynomial time algorithm for determining realizability of a uniform phased matroid that is not essentially oriented this algorithm also in the affirmative case gives a unique canonical realization of the phased matroid 2 phased matroid definitions we will use polar coordinates to denote nonzero complex numbers thus we will view c 0 as r 0 s 1 where s 1 z c z 1 is the complex unit circle definition 2 1 phase of a complex number 3 let s r 0 and s 1 for the complex number z s c the phase of z is ph z 0 if s 0 if s 6 0 thus ph z s 1 0 also s is the norm of z definition 2 2 hypersum 2 define the hypersum s m k 1 k of a finite set s 1 m s 1 0 to be the set of all phases of strictly positive linear combinations of s thus 2 for all 0 0 for all if s ei 1 ei k with k 2 and 1 k 1 then s s 0 ei 1 k if s ei 1 ei k with k 3 and 1 k 1 then s s 0 ei 1 k otherwise i e if the nonzero elements of s do not lie in a closed half circle of s 1 s s 1 0 note that in 1 the hypersum is reffered to as phased convex hull definition 2 3 phirotope 1 a rank r phirotope on the set e is a non zero alternating function er s 1 0 satisfying the following combinatorial complex grassmann plu cker relations for any two subsets x 1 xr 1 y 1 yr 1 of e 0 r 1 k 1 1 k x 1 x k xr 1 xk y 1 yr 1 1 the phirotope definition is a generalization of a chirotope in which im 1 0 1 as suggested by the name the combinatorial complex grassmann plu cker relations are mo tivated by the grassmann plucker relations which the minors of every matrix in cr n with r n satisfy so every such matrix gives rise to a phirotope example 2 4 consider the 3 5 matrix m 1 0 0 12 ei 4 13 ei 20 1 0 1 4 3 ei 4 0 0 1 0 1 with complex entries the function m 5 3 s 1 0 such that m i j k ph det mi j k satisfies the combinatorial complex grassmann plu cker relations and is a phirotope there is a phirotope for any n r matrix with n r proposition 2 5 phirotope of a matrix 3 every matrix m cr e with e r gives rise to the following function m e r s 1 0 1 r 7 ph m furtheremore m is a phirotope notice that if m rr e then m is a chirotope consider m cn r let a gl r c then am ph det a m so multiplication on the left by gl r c rotates the coordinate system 3 definition 2 6 phased matroid 1 the set m s 1 is a phased matroid if is a chirotope then is an oriented matroid definition 2 7 realizable phased matroid realization of a phased matroid let m be a phased matroid with a phirotope m is realizable if there exists a matrix m such that m the matrix m is a realization of m we can also say that the phirotope is realizable with realization m define the equivalence class of a matrix as m am a gl r c notice that if m is a realization of m then every element in the equivalence class m is a realization of m example 2 8 the matrix m in example 2 4 is a realization of the realizable phased matroid m s 1 denoted mm also for any invertible 3 3 matrix a am is a realization of mm definition 2 9 underlying matroid of a phased matroid 1 let m be a rank r phased matroid with phirotope then m i 1 r i 1 ir 6 0 is a matroid called the underlying matroid of m if m is realizable with realization m then its underlying matroid m is realizable with realization m example 2 10 the underlying matroid of mm obtained from the matrix m in example 2 4 is 1 2 3 1 2 5 1 3 4 1 3 5 1 4 5 2 3 5 3 4 5 2 1 remark about uniform phased matroids let be a phirotope there is an underlying matroid m with bases b 6 0 if im s 1 then and m are uniform the matrix m in example 2 4 gives rise to a realizable phased matroid m m which is not uniform because 1 2 4 0 3 the realization space definition 3 1 realization space the realization space over c of a rank r phased matroid m on the ground set e is the quotient space rc m gl r c m cr e m is a realization of m if m is an oriented matroid rr m gl d r m rr e m is a realization of m for the special case of oriented matroids realization spaces have been well studied results from oriented matroid theory apply to the phased matroids that are also oriented matroids theorem 3 2 mne v s universality theorem 4 theorem 8 6 6 1 let v rs be any semialgebraic variety then there exists a rank 3 oriented matroid m whose realization space r m is homotopy equivalent to v 4 2 if v is an open subset of rs then m may be chosen to be uniform however when we consider uniform phased matroids that are not essentially oriented the topology of the realization space is surprisingly simple theorem 3 3 let m be a rank r uniform not essentially oriented realizable phased matroid on n then r m rn 1 0 the proof of theorem 3 3 will appear in section 5 as a motivating lemma we will prove the rank 2 case in which we can drop conditions of uniformality and not essentially orientetability lemma 3 4 let m be a simple rank 2 realizable phased matroid on n elements then r m rn 1 k 0 where k 0 if m is not essentially oriented and k 0 if m is essentially oriented this result for rank 2 uniform phased matroids that are not essentially oriented was previ ously proven in 3 using cross ratios since cross ratios do not generalize to higher dimensions their proof is not generalizable to phased matroids with rank 2 for essentially oriented phased matroids the lemma follows from the fact that all rank 2 oriented matroids have contractible realization spaces 4 we will show an alternative proof for the not essentially oriented case in section 5 first in the following section we will develop tools which will be useful in proving the above statements 4 useful tools in this section we will introduce some tools that help prove theorem 3 3 we will see how some of the content and structure of a potential realization is determined by the phirotope in fact in section 4 1 we will be on the hunt for a canonical form of a realization of a phased matroid in section 4 2 through the triangle lemma we see the geometry of the complex space that real space does not have this provides insight into why the essentially oriented phased matroids have realization spaces so different from the non essentially oriented phased matroids the definitions in this section refer to uniform phased matroids but they can all be generalized to the non uniform case see 10 for details 4 1 canonical form every phased matroid m can be compared to a possibly different phased matroid m which is in canonical form definition 4 18 while m 6 m we will show that r m r m so we can look at the realization space of m in order to understand the realization space of m we will find that a phased matroid in canonical form provides advantages such as easily determining whether or not the phased matroid is essentially oriented as well as easily building a realization of a realizable phased matroid that is not essentially oriented and computing the realization space in order to get a phased matroid into canonical form there are a lot of details that we need to address in this section we will use matroid theoretic facts about bipartite graphs compute signs of some special permutations and recall some basic geometry facts about similar triangles the next lemma will help us prove corollary 4 2 which is an important part of the process of building up a realization of a given phased matroid containing as much information about the potential realization as we can from a phirotope in fact corollary 4 2 simply allows us to 5 relate the minor of a matrix i n containing only columns of n to a maximal minor of i n by bringing in columns of i the two minors will differ only by a sign but how the sign is determined is dependent on so many things that it is worth it s own lemma denote by h r 1 h 1 h k r the ordered set 1 r without the elements h 1 hk hr let j j 1 jk where jl r 1 n and jl jl 1 for all 1 l k denote by h r j the permutation of h r j where the elements of j replace in ascending order the elements of hr which are missing from h r lemma 4 1 consider the matrix i n let n be a k k submatrix of n consisting of rows h h 1 hk r and columns j j 1 jk n let h h k h r k h 1 then det n 1 det i n h r j proof note that is summing for each h h the number of elements in r but not in h which are greater than i the sign 1 is the sign of the shuffle permutation s h j that replaces in order the elements of j for the elements of h removed from r for example let r 7 h 2 3 5 and j 8 11 12 then the permutation is 1 8 11 4 12 6 7 since the determinant is an alternating function the determinant of the submatrix n is given by det n det i n s h j 1 det i n h r j corollary 4 2 letm be a rank r realizable phased matroid with realization i n and phirotope i n let n be a k k submatrix of n consisting of rows h h 1 hk and columns j j 1 jk then for defined as in lemma 4 1 ph det n 1 h r j proof since m is realizable h r j ph det i n h r j 1 ph det n so this follows from lemma 4 1 throughout this paper we are only interested in the case when k 1 2 in the case that k 1 we get the phases of the entries of any potential realization of because 1 r i ph i n i j ph det i n 1 i r j 1 i r j corollary 4 3 suppose 1 r is a basis of m a phirotope of m determines the phases of n for any realization i n of m for example if we consider the matrix m from example 2 4 we see that 1 3 5 ph det 1 0 13 ei 20 0 4 3 ei 4 0 1 1 ei 2 1 3 2 ph m 2 5 definition 4 4 rephasing of a phirotope 3 let be a rank r phirotope of a phased matroid m let 1 n s 1 n the function n r s 1 0 1 r 7 1 r 1 r is the rephasing of by 6 in 3 rephasing is refered to as reorienting motivated by it s similarity to reorientation of oriented matroids lemma 4 5 3 the function is a phirotope let m be the phased matroid with phirotope then m is the rephasing of m by notice that if we start with a chirotope and apply rephase by s 1 n then im 0 0 0 for some 0 s 1 so is a phirotope but not a chirotope and s 1 is a phased matroid but not an oriented matroid let d x 1 xm be the m m diagonal matrix with entries x 1 xm on the diagonal lemma 4 6 3 if m is a realization of m then m d 1 n is a realization of m the following notion of scaling equivalence is borrowed from matroid theory definition 4 7 scaling equivalent matrices 9 let m and n be r n matrices over a field f we say m and n are scaling equivalent if n can be obtained by scaling rows and columns of m by non zero elements of f scaling rows and columns of a r n matrix m is algebraically equivalent to multiplying m on the left by a diagonal r d matrix and on the right by an n n diagonal matrix both with non zero determinant in matroid theory if two matrices are scaling equivalent then they give rise to the same matroid this is not the case with phased matroids however scaling equivalent matrices give rise to phased matroids that are rephasings of each other the following result demonstrates why these are useful to us when studying the realization space theorem 4 8 let m n be phased matroids let m r m n r n if m and n are scaling equivalent then r m r n proof since m and n are scaling equivalent matrices there exist diagonal matrices d 1 and d 2 such that m d 1 nd 2 consider the map f r m r n where f h d 1 hd 2 let k h then there is an a gl r c such that k ah we first check that for f to be well defined we need d 1 kd 2 d 1 hd 2 so we must find a b gl r c such that d 1 kd 2 bd 1 hd 2 let b d 1 ad 11 then d 1 kd 2 d 1 ahd 2 d 1 ad 1 1 d 1 hd 2 bd 1 hd 2 so d 1 kd 2 d 1 hd 2 the inverse map is f 1 g d 11 gd 1 2 since both f and f 1 are quotients of continuous maps f and f 1 are continuous therefore f is a homeomorphism a consequence of theorem 4 8 is that any phased matroid with a phirotope which is a rephasing of chirotope from an oriented matroid gives rise to a phased matroid whose realizability results defer to those of oriented matroids including mne v s universality theorem 3 2 and that determining realizability is np hard 4 proposition 4 10 classifies such phased matroids consider a matrix m rr n m gives rise to a chirotope m which is also a phirotope m with im m 1 0 1 we can multiply m by a gl r c on the left to give a matrix with non real entries which is a realization of the same phased matroid as m if det a r im am 0 6 1 0 1 but am is a phirotope of the same phased matroid that came from a real matrix these special phirotopes are called complexified chirotopes we can also complexify chirotopes that do not come from a matrix let be a chirotope and s 1 r then is a phirotope but is not a chirotope the set s 1 is a phased matroid the phased matroids of such phirotopes are called complexified oriented 7 matroids and have realization spaces that defer to the oriented matroid the original chirotope comes from similarly as theorem 4 8 suggests rephases of complexified chirotopes will give rise to a phase matroidm whose realization space defers to the realiziation space of the original oriented matroid it turns out the matrix m from example 2 4 is scaling equivalent to a real matrix example 4 9 let a ei 2 0 00 2 ei 4 0 0 0 3 and d ei 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 ei 7 4 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 ei 7 4 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 then a 1 0 0 1 10 1 0 1 2 0 0 1 0 1 gives rise to a complexified oriented matroid furthermore a 1 0 0 1 10 1 0 1 2 0 0 1 0 1 d m so mm is a rephrase of the a complexified oriented matroid we call such phased matroids essentially oriented proposition 4 10 essential orientability let m be a phased matroid the following are equivalent 1 m is a rephasing of a complexified oriented matroid 2 for some phirotope of m and some s 1 there exists s 1 n such that im 0 3 for every phirotope i of m there is an i s 1 and i s 1 n such that im i i i 0 i 4 there exist a phirotope of m and s 1 n such that im 1 0 1 ifm is realizable with realization space r m the following are also equivalent to the above 5 for some s 1 n there exists m r m with all real entries 6 for any m r m there exists a matrix n rr n such that m and n are scaling equivalent proof 1 3 m is a rephasing of a complexified oriented matroid m there is some s 1 n such that m m s 1 for all phirotopes i of m there is an i s 1 such that i i is a phirotope of m im i im i 1 0 1 8 2 3 let be phirotopes ofm then there is some s 1 such that suppose there is a s 1 n such that im 0 then im im im 0 2 4 suppose is a phirotope ofm and there is a such that im 0 1 is a phirotope of m and im 1 1 0 1 0 1 5 6 suppose m is a rank r realizable phased matroid on n elements for s 1 n there is a matrix n r m such that n rr n if and only if there is m r m such that md n for every m i r m there is an ai gl r c such that aim i m so aim id n if and only if aim i and n are scaling equivalent matrices for all aim i r m 5 4 suppose there is an m r m such that m rr n then every minor of m r so 1 0 1 for all 4 5 suppose there is a phirotope of m with 1 r 6 0 and s 1 n such that im 1 0 1 consider i n r m since ph i n i j 1 i r j 1 0 1 every entry of i n r definition 4 11 essential orientablity if any of the conditions of proposition 4 10 hold we say m or any of its phirotopes is essentially oriented note that in previous literature essentially oriented phased matroids and phirotopes are referred to as chirotopal 1 3 corollary 4 12 let m be a rank r essentially oriented phased matroid on n let m be a rank r oriented matroid on n with chirotope such that for some phirotope ofm s 1 n and for all n r then r m r m proof this follows from proposition 4 10 and theorem 4 8 as a consequence of corollary 4 12 results about realizations of essentially oriented phased matroids defer to the results about their oriented matroid cousins our main results theorem 3 3 and theorem 6 3 in this paper refer to phased matroids that are not essentially oriented now that we have determined that rephasing a phased matroid results is a phased matroid with a homeomorphically equivalent realization space we can partition phased matroids into realization classes and choose our favorite phirotope of our favorite phased matroid from the same realization class which we will call the canonical phased matroid we do this with the help of the associated bipartite graph a tool also borrowed from matroid theory definition 4 13 associated bipartite graph gm 9 6 4 let m be a rank r simple matroid on n such that 1 r is a basis let gm be the bipartite graph with vertex set n in which ei j is an edge if and only if 1 i r j is a basis of m the two disjoint sets of vertices of the bipartite graph gm are vertices 1 r which are the left hand side and vertices r 1 n which are the right hand side if m is realizable with realization i n then there is an edge ei j in gm if and only if i n i j 6 0 the associated bipartite graph for the phased matroid mm where m is the matrix from example 2 4 is shown in figure 1 notice that by corollary 4 3 if m is uniform then gm is a complete graph 9 1 2 3 4 5 figure 1 the associated bipartite graph for the mm theorem 4 14 5 let m be a rank r matroid on n realizable over f with i n fr n a realization of m let f t 1 tn k be a spanning forest of gm let s 1 sn k be an ordered n k tuple of non zero elements of f then m has a unique realization i n fr n such that for each i n k the entry of n corresponding to ti is si in fact i n can be obtained from i n by a sequence of row and column scalings hence i n is scaling equivalent to i n if m is uniform then f is a tree as a result of theorem 4 14 we see that given a matrix i n whose associated bipartite graph has k connected components we can determine n k entries of n to be any values we want we will utilize this by choosing s 1 sn k to be an n k tuple of ones the next definition helps us decide which spanning tree we will use with our choice of an n k tuple of ones and a particular spanning tree we can build an r n array that might be a realization of m if we can determine the real lengths of the entries that are not determined by the associated bipartite graph theorem 4 14 can be applied to phirotopes regardless of whether or not they are realizable we will be able to use this and the tools to come to build an array which will become a realization of the phirotope if and only of the phirotope is realizable corollary 4 15 let be a rank r phirptope n r s 1 0 let f t 1 tn k be a spanning forest of gm let s 1 sn k be an ordered n k tuple of non zero elements of f then there exists a such that 1 r i 1 i r j sl for all ei j t and for each associated sl s the proof of this follows from theorem 4 14 and corollary 4 2 definition 4 16 canonical spanning tree for each connected component in an associated bipartite graph g with corresponding array a we say the canonical spanning tree of the com ponent is the tree containing all edges associated to the first non zero entry in each row of m the last non zero entry in each column of a assuming it does not make a cycle in g and any other edges of g corresponding to the last non zero entry in each column of a that has not already been included and does not create a cycle example 4 17 the canonical spanning tree for the associated bipartite graph in example 1 is seen as a collection of red dashed edges in figure 2 therorem 4 14 is very useful to us because by theorem 4 8 scaling equivalent matrices give rise to phased matroids with realization spaces with homeomorphically equivalent topology we 10 1 2 3 4 5 figure 2 the associated bipartite graph for the mm will use this to distinguish a canonical realization of a phased matroid that we will use to explore the topology of the realization space of any phased matroid in its equivalence class definition 4 18 canonical form of a realization of m a realization i n of a rank r uniform phased matroid is in canonical form if the n k entries of n that correspond to the canonical spanning tree of gm are 1 a uniform phirotope of m is in canonical form if 1 r 1 j 1 for all j d and 1 i r 1 1 i r for all i r example 4 19 the realization of mm from example 2 4 which is in canonical form would look like the following we will get to the unknown entry soon 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 there may not be such a realization in r mm but there is such a realization in r m m for ei 3 2 ei 7 4 1 ei 7 4 1 the values of come from the diaganol matrix d in example 4 9 since this matrix is scaling equivalent to a real matrix by proposition 4 10 the phased matroids mm and m m are essentially oriented and the unknown value is real corollary 4 20 let m be a rank r realizable phased matroid on n let be the phirotope of m in canonical form let i n be a realization ofm in canonical form thenm is essentially oriented if and only if im 1 0 1 and i n rr n proof suppose m is a realizable essentially oriented phased matroid with phirotope then im 0 for s 1 if is in canonical form then 1 r 1 so 1 and im 1 0 1 in particular 1 i d j ph i n i j 1 0 1 so i n rr n the canonical form of a realization of a realizable uniform phased matroid m is i n i 1 1 n 1 corollary 4 21 let m be a uniform rank r phased matroid on n there exists s 1 n such that r m i n i n is a realization of m in canonical form rn 1 0 11 proof the existence of i n follows from theorem 4 14 using theorem 4 14 in building canonical realization i n we chose the values associated with each of the n 1 edges of our conanical spanning tree to be 1 it is clear that if we had chosen any other set of positive real values s 1 sn 1 rn 1 0 the result would be a different matrix in r m this n 1 degrees of freedom is where the rn 1 0 comes from the equivalence follows from theorem 4 8 4 2 triangle lemma definition 4 22 triangular equation let s 1 such that 6 an equation of the form ph s 1 s 2 where s 1 s 2 r 0 is called a triangular equation the following lemma will be used often to prove later results lemma 4 23 triangle lemma if ph s 1 s 2 is a triangular equation and either s 1 or s 2 are known then the equation can be solved uniquely for the unknown quantity proof consider and s 1 consider the rays through and in the complex plane since ph s 1 s 2 we can draw a triangle with interior angles and as seen in figure 3 the angles and are determined by and therefore the triangular equation determines the triangle up to similarity since either s 1 or s 2 is known the entire triangle is determined by the triangular equation 1 0 0 0 figure 3 the triangle with interior angles and is constructed from the equation ph s 1 s 2 5 proof of theorem 3 3 now that we have a canonical realization and the triangle lemma we can prove our main theorem 12 theorem 5 1 therorem 3 3 let m be a rank r uniform not essentially oriented realizable phased matroid on n then r m rn 1 0 as a warm up we will prove the case for rank 2 phased matroids which is stated as lemma 3 4 5 1 rank 2 phased matroids for rank 2 phased matroids we can drop the condition that the phased matroid is uniform and not essentially oriented and get a similar result recall lemma 3 4 states that for a simple rank 2 realizable phased matroid m on n elements r m rn 1 k 0 where k 0 if m is not essentially oriented and k 0 if m is essentially oriented this result for the uniform rank 2 phased matroids that are not essentially oriented was previously proven in 3 using cross ratios since cross ratios do not generalize to higher di mensions their proof is not generalizable to phased matroids with rank 2 for essentially oriented phased matroids the lemma follows from the fact that all rank 2 oriented matroids have contractible realization spaces 4 5 1 1 proof of lemma 3 4 proof if m is a rank 2 phased matroid and is not uniform then either zeros appear as entries of columns 3 n in the canonical realization or a pair of elements i j are parallel but any column with a zero is either a loop in m or is parallel to either e 1 or e 2 if e is a loop of of m then r m i r m and if elements i j are parallel inm then r m i r 0 r m 10 for the case whenm is essentially oriented the proof follows from analogous results about oriented matroids so without loss of generality we may assumem is a uniform not essentially oriented realizable phased matroid consider a canonical realization m 1 0 1 s 4 4 sn n 0 1 1 1 1 of m notice that 1 i and 2 j give us the phases of each entry of n so the only unknown information about the realization is the values of s 4 sn r 0 in fact i n i n is a canonical realization of m can be thought of as s 4 sn rn 4 0 si m 1 i for a realization m of m 2 since m is not essentially oriented for some j 4 n j 1 1 therefore by lemma 4 23 sj is determined by the equation 3 j ph 1 sj j for any other k 6 j 4 n the equation k j ph sk k sj j determines sk since sj is determined by for all j 4 n the set i n i n is a canonical realization of m is a single point therefore by corollary 4 21 r m rn 1 0 5 1 2 proof of theorem 3 3 the previous proof for rank 2 phased matroids provides insight into the proof for rank r uniform phased matroids that are not essentially oriented 13 proof consider i n r m since m is uniform all entries of n are non zero since m is not essentially oriented there is at least one non real entry in n furthermore by corollary 4 2 for each 1 i r 1 and r 1 j n i j is determined by that is i j 1 r i 1 i 1 j i 1 n thus by corollary 4 21 it remains to find all si j such that 1 i r 1 r 1 j n i

of i m 1 therefore 1 i m 1 1 i m r k j i n det si k i k si j i j sm k m k sm j m j to determine the value of si j there are four cases to consider in each case we find a minor of i n that is equal to a 2 2 minor of i n which results in a triangular equation in which si j is the only unknown for case 1 suppose i j 6 1 then 1 r i 1 1 i r 1 j ph det 1 sij ij 1 1 ph 1 si j i j 3 is a triangular equation and si j is determined by the triangle lemma for the remaining three cases we assume i j 1 for the second case suppose there exists k r 1 such that i k 6 1 we know sik from case 1 without loss of generality assume k j then 1 r i 1 1 i r 1 j k ph det sij ij si k i k 1 1 ph si j i j si k i k is a triangular equation and si j is determined by the triangle lemma for the final two cases si k i k r for all r 1 k n this means the entire row has phase 1 for case 3 we assume there is a non real entry in the jth column the equation 1 i m 1 1 i m r 1 j ph det 1 si j i j 1 sm j m j ph sm j m j si j i j is triangular and si j is determined by the triangle lemma for the final case assume all entries in row i and column j are real there must be a non real entry sm k m k r with m 6 i k 6 j from previous cases sm j and si k are determined also we know i j i k and m j are all 1 so 1 i m 1 1 i m k j ph det si k 1 si j 1 sm k m k sm j 1 ph si ksm j si jsm k m k 14 is a triangular equation so si

are realizable in contrast not all phased matroids are realizable in this section we give an example of a non realizable phased matroid and a simple realizability criterium that can be used to determine in a rank 2 or any other non essentially oriented uniform phased matroid is realizable 6 1 a non realizable rank 2 phased matroid example 6 1 the phased matroidm with phirotope such that 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 2 3 1 2 4 ei 2 2 5 ei 3 3 4 ei 7 4 3 5 ei 5 3 and 4 5 ei 5 6 is not realizable proof it is not hard to check the combinatorial complex grassman plu cker relations to confirm is a phirotope of a phased matroid suppose m is realizable since is in canonical form the proof of lemma 3 4 provides a construction of a potential realization of the values of on all pairs except 4 5 determine the following canonical realization ofm m 1 0 1 ei 2 ei 3 0 1 1 1 1 where 2 4 and 2 5 determine the phases of m 1 4 and m 1 5 respectively and the norm of each entry is determined by 3 4 and 3 5 but 4 5 ei 6 6 ph ei 2 ei 3 ei 11 12 so m is not realizable in 3 a different method is provided to test the realizability of the above phased matroid in which a phirotope is confirmed to be realizable if an equation of 24 terms sums to 0 their method can be generalized to uniform rank 2 phased matroids on n elements by checking the sum for all n 5 subsets of elements of the groundset example 6 1 sheds light on a two point realizability criteria for rank 2 phased matroids proposition 6 2 let m be a uniform rank 2 not essentially oriented phased matroid on n with phirotope in canonical form let j arg 3 j and j arg 3 j arg 2 j then m is realizable if and only if for any pair j k 4 n j k ph sin k sin k 2 k sin j sin j 2 j 4 proof ifm is realizable a unique canonical realization m ofm can be constructed using 2 j and 3 k for all j k 3 where sin j sin j is the norm of m 1 j equation 4 is j k ph j k m and must hold by definition of realizability 15 the 5 point realizability criteria for rank 2 uniform phased matroids is given in 3 depends on cross ratios so it is not generalizable to phased matroids with rank greater than 2 however using the triangle lemma as its foundation the realizability criteria from proposition 6 2 is easily extended to higher ranked phased matroids theorem 6 3 letm be a rank r uniform not essentially oriented phased matroid on n with canonical phirotope let i n be a matrix such that ph i n i j i j and i n i j is determined by i r r 1 j as in theorem 3 3 m is realizable if and only if for all n r ph i n proof given a uniform phased matroid with a phirotope in canonical form it is always possible to construct a potential canonical realization i n of m following the construction in the proof of theorem 3 3 if ph i n for all n r then i n r m otherwise m is not realizable 7 conclusion we have shown that in comparison to oriented matroids uniform phased matroids can have remarkable simple realization space and we can answer the realizability question for uniform not essentially oriented phased matroids in polynomial time in light of a new umbrella theory that encompasses oriented and phased matroids called f matroids in our
