introduction 1 1 background in 1946 erdo s introduced the problem of finding asymptotic bounds on the minimum number of distinct distances among sets of n points in the plane er the erdo s distance problem as it has become known proved infamously difficult and was only finally essentially resolved by guth and katz in 2015 guka the erdo s distance problem has also spawned a wide variety of related questions including the problem of finding maximal point sets with at most k distinct distances characterizing the largest possible point sets satisfying a given property in this way is a classic problem in discrete geometry as another example erdo s introduced the problem of finding maximal point sets of all isosceles triangles in 1947 erke ionin date august 30 2021 2020 mathematics

maximal 3 distance sets in r 4 4 distance sets in r 3 and 6 distance sets in r 2 szos in elmp brdepase brdepast point sets with a low number of distinct triangles in euclidean space are investigated along these lines we consider the related problem of maximal planar point sets admitting at most k distinct angles in 0 we ignore angles of 0 and so as to align our convention with related research see pasha 92 for example although we provide results including the 0 angle as corollaries we completely answer this question for k 2 and k 3 and provide asymptotically tight linear bounds for k 3 in answering this question for k 2 and k 3 we consider systematically consider all possible triangles in such configurations and then reduce to adding points in a finite number of positions by geometric casework we provide linear asymptotic bounds using bounds on the related problem of the minimum number of distinct angles among n non collinear points in the plane 1 2 definitions and results by convention we only count angles of magnitude strictly between 0 and our computations still answer the related optimal point configuration questions including 0 angles see corollaries 3 1 4 1 we begin by introducing convenient notation definition 1 1 let p r 2 then a p abc 0 a b c distinct a b c p now we define the quantity we are interested in studying definition 1 2 p k max p p r 2 not all points in p are collinear a p k we first provide general linear lower and upper bounds for p k in particular we have the following theorem theorem 1 3 for all k 1 2 k 3 p 2 k 12 k 2 k 3 p 2 k 1 12 k 6 in the distance setting the best known upper bound on the analogous parameter is the quadratic 2 k 1 k and no lower bound is well understood szos it is therefore interesting and surprising that we find p k n in the angle setting we prove theorem 1 3 in section 2 furthermore we explicitly compute p 1 p 2 and p 3 and exhaustively identify all maximal point configurations for each proposition 1 4 we have p 1 3 and the equilateral triangle is the unique maximal configuration in order to have only a single angle every triangle of three points in the configuration must be equilateral as this is impossible for point configurations that are not the vertices of an equilateral triangle p 1 3 p 2 and p 3 are considerably less trivial quantities we calculate p 2 p 3 via exhaustive casework simultaneously characterizing all of the unique optimal point configurations up to rigid motion transforma tions and dilation about the center of the configuration we proceed by first considering sets of three points and then search for what additional points may be added without determining too many angles we prove theorem 1 5 in section 3 and theorem 1 6 in section 4 theorem 1 5 we have p 2 5 moreover the unique optimal point configuration is four vertices in a square with a fifth point at its center see a in figure 1 theorem 1 6 we have p 3 5 there are 5 unique optimal configurations shown in figure 1 2 figure 1 optimal two and three angle configurations 5 2 5 3 5 2 general bounds although one may in principle calculate p k for any k by extensive casework as we later calculate p 2 p 3 it quickly becomes overwhelming as such we instead provide general bounds on p 2 k and p 2 k 1 note that the construction of a square with a point in the center is no accident in the case of p 2 indeed adding a point in the center of a regular 2 k gon introduces no additional angles this is because in a regular 2 k gon the line from the center to any boundary vertex intersects an additional vertex on the other side as such the only additional angles that may be added from the center point are those with the center point as the center of the angle for the other angles including it as an endpoint choosing the point on the other end of the line through the center gives an equal angle moreover the angles formed with the center point as the center of the angle are precisely i k for 1 i k 1 which are already achieved among the other points of the regular 2 k gon so using the regular 2 k 2 gon with a point added in the center yields the following lemma lemma 2 1 we have p 2 k 2 k 3 moreover in the case of p 2 k 1 the regular 2 k 3 gon and the projection of a regular 2 k 3 gon onto a line via a stereographic like projection from a cap vertex both achieve 2 k 1 angles providing a bound on p 2 k 1 lemma 2 2 we have p 2 k 1 2 k 3 proposition 2 3 if we wish to also count the 0 angle then we may not add the center to an even polygon and in general we reach a bound of p k k 2 we conjecture that both of these lower bounds are tight in general nonetheless we provide a linear upper bound we achieve this bound as a corollary of a lower bound on the number of distinct angles using progress on the weak dirac conjecture in 1961 erdo s er conjectured the following based on an earlier more difficult conjecture of dirac conjecture 2 4 erdo s 1961 every set p of n non collinear points in the plane contains a point incident to at least dn 2 e lines of l p where l p is the set of lines formed by points in p 3 while dirac s conjecture has not been proven significant progress has been made let l n be the largest proven lower bound proven for dirac s conjecture i e every set p of n non collinear points in the plane contains a point incident to at least l n lines of l p we have l n dn 3 e 1 from ha let a n be the minimum number of distinct angles among n points in the plane we have the following lemma lemma 2 5 for n 3 a n l n 1 2 n 6 proof fix a set p of n non collinear points in the plane let p be a point in p incident to at least n lines of l p fix a point q 6 p in p it shares exactly one line with p note that for a fixed nonzero angle there are exactly two possible lines which r must be on in order for qpr as such since p is incident to n 1 lines without q p is the center angle of at least n 1 2 distinct angles therefore a n n 1 2 we have n dn 3 e 1 from ha as such we have a n n 6 as desired note that such a use of the weak dirac conjecture is known see bmp section 6 2 corollary 2 6 we have p k 6 k proof sincea n n 6 by lemma 2 5 then p k 6 k as point configurations with at least 6 k 1 points define at least k 1 angles 3 computing p 2 5 proof in any point configuration with at least three points there are triangles for any point configuration with at most two angles all triangles must be isosceles we divide into two cases based on whether or not there is an equilateral triangle 3 1 there is an equilateral triangle we consider adding a fourth point in cases figure 2 figure 2 equilateral triangle regions case 1 p a then acp 3 and cap 3 leading to more than two angles case 2 p ab then bcp 3 and one of cpb and apc 2 leading to more than two angles case 3 p ac to the upper right of a then cbp 3 and cpb 3 again leading to more than two angles 4 case 4 p b in this case cbp 3 and cpb 3 leading to more than two angles case 5 p 4 abc in this case one of apb bpc cpa 2 3 and acp 3 leading to more than two angles up to symmetry these cases are exhaustive thus if there is an equilateral triangle in the configuration there can only be at most three points 3 2 there is no equilateral triangle now let a b and c be the vertices of an isosceles triangle with vertex angle base angle and a the apex vertex we reduce the number of possibilities for additional points by partitioning the plane into regions ai figure 3 note that we may without loss of generality assume that figure 3 isosceles triangle regions no fourth point is added within 4 abc as we could then choose that triangle as our initial triangle also note that a 1 and a 1 and a 3 and a 3 are equivalent up to symmetry case 1 p a 1 in this case pab and pcb so regardless of whether or is greater adding p introduces an additional angle so no additional points can be in a 1 or a 1 case 2 p a 2 in this case pcb and pbc are greater than so both must be to not add additional angles but then cpb 2 6 in order to not add angles implying 3 but this implies 4 pcb is an equilateral triangle thus no points may be added in this case case 3 p a 3 or a 3 by symmetry in this case bap and abp so there is an additional angle added regardless and no additional points are possible case 4 p a 4 in this case cap bap so both must equal therefore 2 which implies 4 and 2 moreover since acp and abp are greater than they must both equal 2 so the only possibility for an addable point in this case is for p to be the fourth vertex of the square acpb 5 case 5 p bc if p is on bc between b and c then cap bap in order for these not to introduce additional angles they must both be equal to this implies 4 and 2 and p is the center of the side bc if p bc to the left of c or by symmetry right of b bap and thus bap since 2 2 but then acp 2 thus there is exactly one point possible on line bc the centerpoint of the edge between b and c case 6 p ac or p ab if p is between a and c then cbp and thus cbp but as before 2 moreover one of bpc or bpa is at least 2 thus there are too many angles in this case if p is to the bottom left of c apb and thus apb but again either bca or bcp 2 creating too many angles in this case if p is on ac to the upper right of a pbc and thus equals then pba and must equal and thus 2 this implies 4 and 2 and 4 cbp is an isosceles right triangle with b the apex vertex p on ac to the upper right of a and a at the center of side pc as such in order to add additional points to an isosceles triangle point configuration without adding additional angles we must have 2 and 4 the four additional possible points are marked in figure 4 figure 4 compatible points with the right triangle note that x 4 ax 1 x 4 ax 2 2 so x 4 cannot be in the same point configuration as x 1 or x 2 by symmetry the same follows for x 3 however we may have both x 1 and x 2 or both x 3 and x 4 either of which give the unique optimal configuration a in figure 1 corollary 3 1 one might also wish to include the trivial 0 angle in our count in this case p 2 4 and the unique configuration is the square proof the only 5 point configuration no longer holds when we count the 0 angle figure 4 displays all valid four point configurations which define only 2 angles excluding 0 as detailed in the proof of p 2 all the shown points but x 2 define a 0 angle so the only valid 4 point configuration is the square 6 4 computing p 3 5 in this section we prove the surprising result that p 3 5 that is adding an additional allowable distinct angle from two to three does not increase the maximum number of points in an optimal point configuration proof we divide the casework for this section into four parts based on the triangles exhibited in the point configuration 1 there is a scalene triangle 2 all triangles are isosceles with at least one with base angle larger than vertex angle 3 all triangles are isosceles with the base angle at most the vertex angle with at least one non equilateral triangle 4 all triangles are equilateral 4 1 there is a scalene triangle let a b and c be the vertices of a scalene triangle in the configuration we without loss of generality assume figure 5 as in the proof of theorem 1 5 we begin by figure 5 scalene triangle regions reducing the number of possible points to a finite number by region based casework case 1 p a 1 as bap no points may be added in a 1 case 2 p a 2 in this case abp and thus must equal moreover bap if bap bpa thus bap which implies bpa but bpc bpa so we define a fourth angle therefore there cannot be points added in a 2 case 3 case 4 p a 3 a 4 as bcp no points may be added in a 4 case 5 p a 5 in this case cbp and thus cbp moreover cap and is thus or which implies pab or respectively if cap we have that pab and thus is equal to so 7 2 then abp cannot be because then apb so abp so 2 and 2 so the angles are 7 2 7 and 4 7 we then have figure 6 figure 6 four point kite configuration 7 2 4 alternatively we have pab and thus cap then so abp and implies 2 i e a b c p are the vertices of a rectangle as such we reach figure 7 figure 7 four point rectangular configuration therefore there are exactly two possible points to add in a 5 with each choice exactly deter mining the angles and case 6 p a 6 as acp no points may be added in a 6 case 7 p ab if p is to the right of b then acp note that 2 then if p is to the left of a pac 2 and must equal but then and are supplementary implying 0 finally if p is between a and b one of cpa and cpb is at least 2 so 2 moreover as neither nor can be supplementary to we have that the supplement of is and hence 2 this yields a diagram like figure 8 so exactly one point may be added on ab and it forces 2 8 figure 8 four point configuration from case 7 case 8 p bc if p is between b and c then bap recall that 2 then if p is not on bc and is closest to b abp 2 and thus must equal so but this implies 0 finally if p is not on bc and is closest to c then acp is supplementary to since neither nor can supplementary to be without implying the other is 0 this implies 2 we then have the configurations in figure 9 since cap or figure 9 four point configurations from case 8 so exactly two points can be added on bc and both force 2 case 9 p ac if p is between a and c then one of bpa and bpc are at least 2 and must thus be since neither nor can be supplementary to this implies 2 however abp and thus must be this then yields 2 2 from 4 abp contradicting 2 since 6 if p is left of a we have pab 2 and thus must be but this implies and are supplementary if p is right of c then bcp is supplementary to since neither nor can be this implies 2 this leads to the allowable point configuration in figure 10 so exactly one point may be added in this case with 2 being forced case 10 p in the interior of 4 abc in this case pac we no points may be added 9 figure 10 four point configuration from case 9 figure 11 compatible points with the right triangle it now remains to show that all six addable points are mutually incompatible suppose we add p a 5 as in the first case of a kite figure 6 as 6 2 as in all the other cases no additional points may be added where 2 we have the five point placements to consider presented in figure 11 suppose we add x 1 adding x 2 yields an angle x 1 x 2 b 2 or x 1 x 2 a 2 the diagonals cannot intersect at right angles lest adding x 3 adds x 1 ax 3 2 and similarly for x 4 adding x 5 adds x 1 bx 5 2 suppose we add x 2 adding x 3 yields x 2 cx 3 2 and similarly for x 4 adding x 5 adds ax 2 x 5 2 suppose we add x 3 adding x 4 creates ax 3 x 4 2 adding x 5 forces ax 3 x 5 bx 5 x 3 abx 5 2 but bax 3 2 so the angles in abx 5 x 3 do not add to 2 finally suppose we add x 4 and x 5 in this case cx 4 x 5 cx 3 x 5 so if there is a scalene triangle in the point configuration there can be at most four points 4 2 all triangles are isosceles with at least one with base angle larger than vertex angle let a b and c be the vertices of an isosceles triangle with the base angle larger than the vertex angle figure 12 specifically cba abc acb 10 figure 12 isosceles triangle with small vertex angle case 1 p a 1 note that bcp let this new angle be then since only three angles are admissible and since pca acb then pca or pca suppose pca then pcb 2 additionally since pbc pbc since 2 then bpc lest the angles in 4 pbc be too large then as 4 pbc must be isosceles bpc thus the angles in 4 bpc sum to 2 2 2 2 a contradiction thus pca in this case observe that pbc and so pbc similarly pba thus giving bca 2 then 3 the angles in 4 abc must add to so 2 5 which implies 5 moreover as 4 pbc must be isosceles cpb then as bpa cpa we have bpa or bpa both of which determine pac thus in this case we have two points ina 1 which are contenders to give acceptable four point configurations figure 13 figure 13 configurations of interest from case 1 consider further the case where bpa we have pabc is a parallelogram we have deduced above that pb bisects abc but this is only true if abcp is a rhombus however this would mean that 11 4 abc is equilateral since then ab ac bc contradicting our original assumption that thus this case is impossible and bpa so there is exactly one point we may add in a 1 thus forming the left configuration of figure 13 and by symmetry an additional one point in a 1 case 2 p a 2 note that bcp bca and cpb cab thus no points may be added in a 2 case 3 p a 3 if p a 3 then abp then as pab we have apb and thus apb so that we may still have only three angles but then apc apb yielding a fourth angle thus no new angles may be added in a 3 or a 3 case 4 p a 4 in this case pac bac bca pca thus there are already four angles and no points can be added in a 4 case 5 p inside 4 abc in this case pab pac cab so let pab pac as 4 abp must be isosceles and cannot be the vertex angle of 4 abp since this implies the vertex angle of 4 abp must be so 2 and 2 but this is a contradiction as 2 no points are addable in this case case 6 p bc first assume p is between b and c that is p is located on the base of 4 abc then pab and one of pba or cpa 2 thus no points can be added on the base of 4 abc now suppose that p is not between b and c by symmetry we may assume that p is on the left i e it is closer to c than to b now since 2 acp 2 as 4 acp must be isosceles cannot be a base angle and we have cpa pac this implies 2 2 and 2 along with this yields 5 2 3 so two points are addable in this case one on either side of the edge bc see figure 14 figure 14 four point configuration from case 6 case 7 p ac or p ab by symmetry we may assume p ac first assume p is between a and c that is p is located on a leg of 4 abc in this case one of apb and bpc 2 let this angle be as cbp and thus must equal since 4 cbp must be isosceles we have bpc so bpa and moreover we have 2 this again implies 5 2 3 this is a legal configuration next assume that p ac is not on the triangle s side and that it is closer to a than to c in this case bap and cpb cab thus no points may be added in this case now assume that p ac is not on the triangle s side and that it is closer to c than to a then we have a new angle pba cba we also have pcb because 2 so to maintain only three angles we must have pcb pba then as 4 cbp must be 12 isosceles and bcp must be the vertex angle cbp cpb as before we conclude that 5 2 5 3 5 this is a legal configuration so in this case all our angles are exactly determined and there are two points addable on ac and by symmetry two points addable on ab so there are only eight addable points in the case of there being an isosceles triangle with vertex angle smaller than base angle figure 15 we examine each of these points up to symmetry and examine which are compatible figure 15 compatible points with the isosceles triangle with small vertex angle combination case 1 including x 1 we cannot add x 4 as x 4 x 1 a cx 1 a additionally note that bx 1 x 4 bx 1 x 2 ax 3 x 1 and thus none of x 4 x 3 or x 2 may be added each of x 1 x 2 and x 3 are individually compatible with x 1 leading to three valid five point configurations including x 1 see b d e of figure 1 by symmetry x 1 is then individually compatible with x 1 x 2 and x 3 combination case 2 including x 2 note that x 2 x 3 c x 2 x 3 c ax 4 x 2 so none of x 3 x 3 or x 4 are addable in this case adding x 2 is analogous to adding both x 1 and x 3 to 4 abc so x 2 is addable and x 4 is addable as the projection of a regular pentagon onto a line via one of its vertices so there are three valid five point configurations including x 2 see e d c of figure 1 by symmetry x 2 is compatible with exactly x 1 x 2 and x 4 combination case 3 including x 3 in this case cx 4 x 3 so x 4 is not addable in this case adding x 3 creates a projected pentagon and adding x 4 creates the construction of a trapezoid with a point in the middle and both are individually compatible with x 3 so each of x 1 x 3 and x 4 may be individually added alongside x 3 leading to three valid five point configurations including x 3 see e c d of figure 1 by symmetry x 3 is compatible with x 1 x 3 and x 4 combination case 4 including x 4 x 4 is compatible with x 4 in combination with the above case work we have x 4 is individually compatible with exactly x 2 x 3 and x 4 so there are three valid five point configurations including x 4 see c d e of figure 1 by symmetry x 4 is compatible with exactly x 2 x 3 and x 4 13 at this point we have exhaustively identified all our five point configuration for this case of from our casework we see there are no compatible addable points which share an additional compatible point therefore there are most five points in this case with c e and f of figure 1 as the possible five point configurations 4 3 all triangles are isosceles with the base angle at most the vertex angle with at least one non equilateral triangle as before we proceed by region based casework fortunately whenever we en counter a scalene triangle or an isosceles triangle with the vertex angle larger than the base angle we reduce to the previous cases our diagram for this section is figure 16 where figure 16 isosceles triangle with large vertex angle case 1 p a 1 in this case bpc since pcb and pbc we then have two cases if bpc then pcb and pbc cannot both be as 2 moreover 4 cpb must be isosceles and neither pcb nor pbc can be so both must be this implies 2 2 and but bpa creating more than 3 angles if bpc then since cpa bpa both must be so 2 now 4 pcb must be isosceles since 2 this implies both pbc and pcb must be but then 3 6 and 2 3 figure 17 figure 17 four point configuration from case 1 as such there is exactly one point addable in this case and it forces the choice of and 14 case 2 p a 2 or a 2 in this case bcp and cap so no points may be added case 3 p a 3 as both cap bap we have three cases 1 cap bap 2 cap bap 6 and swapping cap and bap by symmetry and 3 bap cap 6 case 1 implies 2 and hence 4 2 moreover 4 bcp must be isosceles and must include one of or note 4 bcp cannot be equilateral as then acp 7 12 and we have four angles note that 2 cannot be a base angle in 4 bcp and being the vertex angle reduces to the previous casework in section 4 2 thus the only option is cbp bcp 4 and bpc 2 yielding a valid configuration the square abpc case 2 implies this is illustrated in the figure 18 figure 18 four point configuration from case 3 first we show that if then abp which implies cbp we similarly have bcp but then bpc 2 yielding four angles 2 thus we then have two sub subcases to consider 2 i abp 2 ii abp 6 in case 2 i note that cbp since 4 abp must be isosceles with largest angle the vertex angle apb then we have 2 2 contradicting the assumption of case 2 that 6 in case 2 ii we have since cbp it must equal so 2 this implies 3 thus 5 2 5 and 3 5 since 4 acp must be isosceles with smaller base angle apc completing 4 abp we have apb but then 4 abp is isosceles with smaller vertex angle thus this case reduces to the previous casework in case 3 we have 2 now cbp cannot be since 6 as it cannot be either thus it must be since 6 we must then have 2 so we have 4 thus 6 3 2 3 this yields the valid point configuration in figure 19 so there are exactly two addable points p a 3 and each forces a choice of and case 4 p a 4 or a 4 in this case cap and apc thus no points are addable in this case case 5 p ac or ab by symmetry if p is to the left of a pab 6 we then have two subcases 1 pab 2 pab 6 15 figure 19 four point configuration from case 3 in case 1 pab implies 2 and 4 as 4 pab must be isosceles bpa pba 4 so we get the valid configuration in figure 20 figure 20 four point configuration from case 5 in case 2 we have pab note 4 pbc needs to be isosceles with the vertex angle at least as large as the base angle and that pcb thus since pbc pbc and bpc then abp since 4 pab must be isosceles and pab 6 so 2 2 and this implies 5 2 5 and 3 5 but then 4 pba has angles 2 5 2 5 5 and so the vertex angle is smaller than the base angles thus this case reduces to the previous section now if p is between a and c then abp cbp furthermore bpc giving four angles so no points can be added in this subcase finally if p is to the bottom right of c then bcp but 4 bcp must be isosceles with largest angle not repeated thus cbp so exactly two points are addable in this case and they exactly determine and the second by symmetry case 6 p bc in this case left of b is equivalent to right of c by symmetry so we without loss of generality consider p left of b in this case pba then 4 pba must be isosceles with largest angle non repeated so pab so no points are addable in this subcase it remains to consider p between b and c in this case 4 acp and 4 abp are isosceles triangles including however cannot be the vertex angle so another of their angles must be and the 16 third since cap pab we must then have 2 thus we have 4 and 2 the resulting valid point configuration is displayed in figure 21 figure 21 four point configuration from case 6 so there is a single addable point in this case and it forces the choice of and case 7 p in the interior of 4 abc in this case pbc pcb and thus cpb is greater than thus no points are addable in this case combinations adding more than one point now we determine which of the six addable points are mutually compatible as exactly two force 2 3 6 and 3 those two from case 1 and case 3 are at most compatible with each other this is displayed in figure 22 figure 22 attempting to combine cases 1 and 3 however this adds an additional angle qcp 3 2 so we only consider the addable points which force 2 and 4 such addable points are shown in figure 23 both pairs x 1 x 2 and x 3 x 4 are compatible and both yield a square with a point in the center see a of figure 1 17 figure 23 compatible points with the right triangle however x 3 is not compatible with either of x 1 x 2 for x 1 then 4 x 1 x 3 b is not isosceles and similarly for x 2 also x 4 is not compatible with either of x 1 x 2 as then we have angles bx 1 x 4 or bx 2 x 4 therefore the only 5 point configurations are a b c x 1 x 2 a b c x 3 x 4 therefore only 5 points are allowed in this case and the only acceptable 5 point configuration of the square with its center see a in figure 1 4 4 there are only equilateral triangles since an equilateral triangle has all equal side lengths every distance between two points in the configuration must be equal that is we need a 1 distance set the largest 1 distance set in the plane is the equilateral triangle thus no configuration of four or more points can exist defining only equilateral triangles the maximal number of points in this case is thus three then across all cases we find that the largest configurations of points on the plane which define at most three angles contain exactly five points as such p 3 5 and the complete list of configurations is shown in figure 1 corollary 4 1 one might also wish to include the trivial 0 angle in our count in this case p 3 5 but the square with the center point and the pentagon are now the only valid configurations proof the set of valid five point configurations when we count the 0 angle must be a subset of the valid five point configurations we identified above by direct inspection the square with the center point and the pentagon are the only of the five in figure 1 which define only three angles all the others define three angles greater than zero and also the 0 angle by collinearity 5 future work while it seems possible to compute p k by exhaustive casework for higher values of k the casework quickly becomes overwhelming additionally while it is potentially possible to repeat such methods in higher dimensions the visualization of the proofs played a crucial role in this analysis in combination with the added degrees of freedom from adding dimensions this would make this method of computation quickly intolerable 18 future work may tighten our upper bound on p k however we make the following conjecture conjecture 5 1 the lower bound on p k in theorem 1 3 is tight namely p 2 k 2 k 3 and p 2 k 1 2 k 3 for all k 1 therefore we believe that future work should improve the upper bound of p n 6 n either via progress towards the weak dirac conjecture which would still fall short of our conjecture or by some other means alternatively future research may find a more efficient method of constructing viable point sets without the need for the exhaustive search we perform we propose the related problem of characterizing optimal point sets in higher dimensions with a low number of solid angles definition 5 2 solid angles given d 1 points in rd fix one of the points p let s be a unit d dimensional hypersphere about p project the remaining d points onto the surface of the sphere along the lines connecting them to p the solid angle formed by the d 1 points with center p is the surface area of s enclosed by the projections of the other points onto s and connected via geodesics solid angles have applications to physics and have not been extensively studied in the context of discrete geometry they provide an exciting new avenue for angle related problems they also motivate the following problem for a fixed d 3 what is the maximum number of non coplanar points in a configuration
