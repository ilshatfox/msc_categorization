weakly distinguishing graph polynomials on addable properties johann a makowsky and vsevolod rakita abstract a graph polynomial p is weakly distinguishing if for almost all finite graphs g there is a finite graph h that is not isomorphic to g with p g p h it is weakly distinguishing on a graph property c if for al most all finite graphs g c there is h c that is not isomorphic to g with p g p h we give sufficient conditions on a graph property c for the characteristic clique independence matching and domination and polyno mials as well as the tutte polynomial and its specialisations to be weakly distinguishing on c one such condition is to be addable and small in the sense of c mcdiarmid a steger and d welsh 2005 another one is to be of genus at most k contents 1 introduction and

makowsky and vsevolod rakita 1 introduction and preliminaries we consider only unless otherwise stated simple finite loopless undirected graphs with no parallel edges graphs with vertices labeled 1 n a graph prop erty is a family of graphs that is closed under isomorphisms for a graph property c denote by c n the graphs of order n in c we only consider properties such that c n is non empty for all sufficiently large n let p be a graph polynomial we say that two non isomorphic graphs g and h are p mates if p g p h and that g is p unique if it has no p mates p is trivial if all graphs g h are p mates p is complete if all graphs g are p unique in this paper we investigate conditions which imply that almost all graphs in a graph property c have a p mate more formally we give the following definitions let p be a graph polynomial and denote by g n the family of graphs of order n with vertices labeled 1 n and by up n the set of p unique graphs of order n definition 1 1 p is weakly distinguishing if lim n up n g n 0 and that p is almost complete if lim n up n g n 1 in 5 bolloba s pebody and riordan conjectured conjecture 1 bpr conjecture the chromatic and tutte polynomials are almost complete in 17 the analogous question for r regular hypergraphs was considered and for r 3 the conjecture was refuted in 24 it was observed as a remark in the conclusions that the independence polynomial in g x discussed in section 7 3 is weakly distinguishing on all finite graphs in 15 it was proven that an infinite number of graph polynomials among them the independence clique and harmonious polynomials are weakly distinguishing a natural way to approach the question whether a graph polynomial p is weakly distinguishing almost complete or otherwise is to ask given a graph property c whether almost all graphs in c are p unique in c let c be a graph property and denote by up c n g c n g has no p mate in c definition 1 2 p is weakly distinguishing on c if lim n up c n c n 0 and that p is almost complete on c if lim n up c n c n 1 in this paper we prove that many well studied graph polynomials are weakly dis tinguishing in infinitely many graph properties c example 3 2 however all these properties c are small in the sense that they are sets of measure 0 in the collection of all graphs so these results do not imply that any of the above polynomials are weakly distinguishing or almost complete for arbitrary properties c weakly distinguishing graph polynomials on addable properties 3 the graph polynomials for which we show that they are weakly distinguishing for c include the characteristic polynomial the domination polynomial and the polynomial which is a generalization of the both the matching and the tutte poly nomial these three polynomials are mutually incomparable in distinctive power by proposition 2 3 once we know that is weakly distinguishing for a graph prop erty c the holds also for all the graph polynomials which are substitution instances of in c this includes the matching polynomials the independence polynomial the chromatic polynomial the tutte polynomial the euler polynomial and many others see section 7 this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce a method to com pare distinctive power of graph polynomials and formulate how to use it lemma a in section 3 we give a graph theoretic background on addable properties and graphs of genus at most k and formulate our main tools lemma b and lemma c in sections 4 and 5 we prove our results theorems 4 4 4 7 for the characteris tic polynomial theorems 5 5 5 8 for the domination polynomial in section 6 we prove the same for the polynomial and in section we apply lemma a to derive the corresponding results for the matching polynomials the independence polynomial the chromatic polynomial the tutte polynomial the euler polynomial and many others in section 8 we draw conclusions and present open problems acknowledgements preliminary versions of our results were presented at the 19 th international conference on random structures and algorithms 15 to 19 july 2019 zu rich switzerland the results of sections 6 and 7 were partially obtained during seminar 19401 in dagstuhl comparative theory for graph polynomials in october 2019 we want to thank the participants of the dagstuhl seminar delia garijo anna de mier marc noy elena ravve and peter tittmann for valuable discussions and comments thanks go especially to peter tittmann for his guid ance and comments about invariants derivable from polynomial which helped us formulating section 7 2 comparing graph polynomials in this section we provide a tool lemma a which allows us to show that many graph polynomials are weakly distinguishing definition 2 1 let c be a graph property p and q be two graph polynomials and g and h two finite graphs i g and h are similar if they have the same number of vertices edges and connected components ii p cd p q or q is at least as distinctive as p in c if for all graphs g h c q g x q h x implies p g y p h y iii p cd p q or p and q are of the same distinctive power in c if p c d p q and q cd p p iv p cs d p q or p and q are of the same distinctive power in c on similar graphs if if for all similar graphs g h c q g x q h x implies q g y q h y v p cs d p q if p c s d p q and q c s d p p vi for all graph properties c p cd p q implies p c s d p q 4 johann a makowsky and vsevolod rakita if c consists of all finite graphs we omit it the partial preorders d p and s d p between graph polynomials or general graph invariants are studied extensively in 16 a complete trivial graph poly nomial is a maximal minimal element with respect to d p example 2 2 i the chromatic polynomial g x and the tutte polynomial satisfy g x s d p t g x y but not g x d p t g x y see section 7 because t x y does not determine the order of g in the presence of isolated vertices ii the characteristic polynomial pa g x and the defect aka acyclic matching polynomial g x from section 7 2 are d p equivalent on forests see 10 iii let g be the loopless complement graph of a simple graph g and p g x be a possibly multivariate graph polynomial put p g x p g x then p g x d p p g x if we relativize this to a graph property c p g x cd p p g x holds provided c is closed under complement graphs proposition 2 3 the following graph polynomials are pairwise incomparable by s d p i the chromatic polynomial g x and the independence polynomial in g x from section 7 ii the characteristic polynomial pa g x from sections 4 and the chromatic polynomial g x iii the characteristic polynomial pa g x and the independence polynomial in g x iv the characteristic polynomial pa g x and the domination polynomial dom g x from sections 4 and 5 v the characteristic polynomial and the polynomial from section 6 vi the domination polynomial and the polynomial proof the first three examples are from 16 for iv vi we first note that all graphs of order less than 8 and all trees of order less than 10 are unique see 26 a consider the graphs c 4 tk 1 and s 5 in figure 1 we have pa s 5 x pa c 4 tk 1 x x 2 x 2 x 2 dom s 5 1 1 dom c 4 tk 1 1 0 and s 5 x 6 c 4 tk 1 x since they are of order 5 figure 1 pa mates b let p 5 and p 5 be the graphs of order 5 in figure 4 used in corollary 5 4 dom p 5 x dom p 5 x since every dominating set of p 5 is also a dominating set of p 5 pa p 5 x x x 1 x 1 x 2 3 6 pa p 5 x x x 2 x 3 x 2 x 1 weakly distinguishing graph polynomials on addable properties 5 hence pa p 5 x 6 pa p 5 x p 5 x 6 p 5 x since both p 5 and p 5 are unique figure 2 mates c the graphs g 1 and g 2 figure 2 are of order 10 therefore we have g 1 x g 2 x however dom g 1 x x 10 10 x 9 40 x 8 82 x 7 92 x 6 56 x 5 16 x 4 and dom g 2 x x 10 10 x 9 41 x 8 86 x 7 94 x 6 48 x 5 9 x 4 hence dom g 1 x 6 dom g 2 x and pa g 1 x x 2 x 4 x 3 4 x 2 2 x 3 x 4 x 3 4 x 2 2 x 3 and pa g 2 x x 2 x 1 x 1 x 2 2 x 4 5 x 2 3 hence pa g 1 x 6 pa g 2 x now a and b proves iv a and c proves v and b and c proves vi in section 7 we use the following observation lemma a let p g x and q g y two graph polynomials and c and d be graph properties with d c assume that p cs d p q and q is weakly distinguishing in c then also p is weakly distinguishing in c but not necessarily in d proof clearly p cs d p q implies that up n uq n hence lim n uq n g n lim n up n g n 3 addable properties and graphs of genus k we discuss properties on which the tutte domination matching clique and characteristic polynomials are weakly distinguishing these properties were discussed in 20 and 18 3 1 small addable classes definition 3 1 we say a graph property a is decomposable if a graph is in a if and only if each of its connected components are in a we say a graph property a is bridge addable if for each graph g a and every two vertices u v in different components of g the graph obtained by adding an edge between u and v is also in a we say a graph property a is addable if it is decomposable and bridge addable example 3 2 the following properties are easily seen to be addable i planar graphs ii outerplanar graphs iii series parallel graphs 6 johann a makowsky and vsevolod rakita iv graphs with tree width at most k for k 2 v k colorable graphs for k 2 vi graphs with no cycles of length greater than k vii graphs with no kk minor for k 2 let a be a graph property if a is minor closed that is closed under deletion of vertices and edges and under contraction of edges the graph minor theorem says that a is characterized by a finite set of forbidden minors see 14 for more on graph minors and the graph minor theorem we can characterize addable minor closed graph properties in terms of their forbidden minors proposition 3 3 19 let a be a minor closed graph property then a is addable if and only if each excluded minor of a is 2 connected note that any non empty minor closed addable graph property a contains all forests as it contains the graph with a single vertex and is closed under taking dis joint unions of graphs in a and under adding edges between different components in addition to being addable we will require the properties we consider to be small definition 3 4 we say that a graph property a is small if there exists a constant a 0 such that an ann for all sufficiently large n the following result of norine et al is convenient theorem 3 5 23 let c be a proper minor closed graph property then c is small let h be a graph on vertex set 1 h and let g be a graph on the vertex set 1 n where n h let w v g with w h and let the root rw denote the least element in w we say that w is a pendant appearance of h in g if a the increasing bijection from 1 h to w gives an isomorphism between h and and the induced subgraph g w of g and b there exists exactly one edge between w and v g w and this edge is incident with the root rw our method for proving graph polynomials are weakly distinguishing will relay on the following theorem theorem 3 6 mcdiarmid steger welsh 20 let c be a non empty addable and small graph property let h c be a connected graph and let rn be a random graph selected uniformly at random from the graphs of order n in c denote by fh rn the number of pendant appearances of h in rn then there are constants 0 n 0 n such that for all n n 0 p fh rn n e n for our purposes we shall only need a weaker corollary of theorem 3 6 corollary 3 7 let a be an addable proper minor closed graph property h a fixed connected graph in a denote by a n the set of all n vertex graphs g a that have at least one pendent appearance of h then limn a n an 1 all the properties listed in example 3 2 are addable and minor closed hence the corollary applies to them using this corollary we get lemma b let p be a graph polynomial a a small addable graph property if there is a fixed h a such that if a graph g a has a pendant appearance of h g has a p mate g a then p is weakly distinguishing on a weakly distinguishing graph polynomials on addable properties 7 proof by corollary 3 7 almost all graphs g a have a pendant appearance of h and hence almost all graphs g a have a p mate so p is weakly distinguishing on a 3 2 graphs with genus at most k let g be a graph the genus of g denoted g g is the minimal genus of a surface in which g can be embedded for more on graphs embedded in surfaces see for example 13 22 it is easy to see that g g is well defined as for all g g g e g for k n denote by ck the property of graphs with genus at most k note that in general ck is not addable for instance the genus of k 5 the complete graph with 5 vertices is 1 but the genus of a disjoint union of two copies of k 5 has genus 2 so we can not apply theorem 3 6 to ck however the same result does hold for ck with a slight modification theorem 3 8 mcdiarmid 18 let h be a connected graph k n and let rn be a random graph selected uniformly at random from the graphs of order n in ck denote by fh rn the number of pendant appearances of h in rn then there are constants 0 n 0 n such that for all n n 0 p fh rn n e n again we only need a weaker corollary of this theorem corollary 3 9 let h a fixed connected planar graph k n and let a ck denote by a n the set of all n vertex graphs g a that have at least one pendent appearance of h then limn a n an 1 using this corollary we get lemma c let p be a graph polynomial ck the property of graphs with genus at most k if there is a planar graph h such that if a graph g has a pendant appearance of h g has a p mate g ck then p is weakly distinguishing on ck proof by corollary 3 9 almost all graphs g ck have a pendant appearance of h and hence almost all graphs g ck have a p mate so p is weakly distinguishing on ck 4 the characteristic polynomial definition 4 1 let g be a graph and denote by ag its adjacency matrix the characteristic polynomial of g denoted pa g is defined as the characteristic poly nomial of ag the roots of pa g are referred to as the spectrum of g a pa unique graph is usually referred to as a graph determined by its spectrum and if g and h are two non isomorphic graphs such that pa g pa h g and h are said to be cospectral the characteristic polynomial and particularly its roots are a widely studied topic see e g 6 for an introduction a classic result of schwenk states that almost all trees are not determined by their spectrum see 25 for details using corollary 3 7 we can extend this result to all small addable graph properties we use the following recurrence relation for the characteristic polynomial lemma 4 2 see 7 let g 1 and g 2 be two graphs and let v 1 v g 1 v 2 v g 2 denote by h the graph obtained from the disjoint union of g 1 and g 2 by adding an edge from v 1 to v 2 then pa h x pa g 1 x pa g 2 x pa g 1 v 1 x pa g 2 v 2 x 4 1 8 johann a makowsky and vsevolod rakita consider the graphs in figure 3 considered by schwenk in 25 figure 3 cospectral graphs note that s and r are isomorphic and we can check that pa s v x pa r u x x 8 6 x 6 10 x 4 4 x 2 thus we get lemma 4 3 let gs be a graph with a pendent appearance of s rooted at v denote by gr the graph obtained from g by replacing the pendant appearance of s in g with a pendant appearance of r rooted at u then gs and gr are cospectral mates proof denote by w v gs the vertex adjacent to v that is not in the pendant appearance of s and by h the graph obtained from gs by deleting all the vertices in the pendant appearance of s by applying relation 4 1 to gs with the edge wv we get pa gs x pa s x pa h x pa s v x pa h w x by applying relation 4 1 to gr with the edge wu we get pa gr x pa r x pa h x pa r u x pa h w x but since pa r x pa s x and pa s v x pa r u x we get that pa gs x pa gr x so gs and gr are cospectral mates note that s and r as unrooted graphs are isomorphic thus we have theorem 4 4 let a be a small addable graph property such that s a then pa is weakly distinguishing on a proof from lemmas b and 4 3 we get that pa is weakly distinguishing on a corollary 4 5 let a be a proper minor closed addable graph property then pa is weakly distinguishing on a proof since all forests are in a and s is a tree by theorems 4 4 and 3 5 pa is weakly distinguishing on a since all the properties in list 3 2 are addable and minor closed we have corollary 4 6 pa is weakly distinguishing on all the properties listed in example 3 2 weakly distinguishing graph polynomials on addable properties 9 similarly we get theorem 4 7 denote by ck the class of graphs of genus at most k then pa is weakly distinguishing on ck for all k n proof since s is a tree from lemmas c and 4 3 we get that pa is weakly distin guishing on ck instead of the characteristic polynomial pa which is based on the adjacency matrix one can also look at the analogue graph polynomial pl which is based on the laplacian matrix lg dg ag where dg is the diagonal matrix with diagonal elements dv v deg v for each v v g now pl g x is the characteristic polynomial of lg an early survey about the laplacian polynomial may be found in 21 the graph polynomials are d p equivalent on regular graphs but d p incomparable on all finite graphs cf 6 and 16 our proofs of theorems 4 4 and 4 7 do not work for pl g x problem 4 1 find two graphs r and s which can be used two prove the analogue of theorems 4 4 and 4 7 5 the domination polynomial the domination polynomial is the generating function of dominating sets in a given graph g more formally definition 5 1 let g be a graph a set s v g is called a dominating set if for every v v g either v s or v has a neighbor u s define dom g x s v g x s where the sum is over all dominating sets of g the domination polynomial was extensively studied in recent years see 2 for a survey in 12 the following was observed lemma 5 2 let g be a graph we say a vertex v v g is a stem if it has a neighbor u v g with deg u 1 assume g has two stems u u g u u e g and denote by g the graph resulting from g by deleting the edge u u then for every set s v g s is a dominating set of g if and only if s is a dominating set of g proof if s is a dominating set of g it is clearly also a dominating set of g on the other hand let s be a dominating set of g after deleting u u the only vertices that are perhaps not dominated by s are u u but u has a vertex of degree 1 as a neighbor so either it or u are in s and in either case u is dominated the same applies to u so s is a dominating set of g from this lemma we get theorem 5 3 every graph g that has two distinct stems has a dom mate proof this is a direct consequence of the lemma thus we have corollary 5 4 let g be a graph that has a pendant appearance of p 5 rooted at r see figure 4 and let g be the graph obtained from g by replacing the pendant appearance of p 5 with a pendant appearance of p 5 rooted at r then g and g are dom mates 10 johann a makowsky and vsevolod rakita figure 4 a path of length 5 and so theorem 5 5 let a be a small addable graph property such that p 5 p 5 a then dom is weakly distinguishing on a proof from lemma b and corollary 5 4 we get that dom is weakly distinguishing on a corollary 5 6 let a be a proper minor closed addable graph property such that p 5 a then dom is weakly distinguishing on a proof note that since all forests are in a p 5 a and hence from theorems 5 5 and 3 5 dom is weakly distinguishing on a as in the previous sections we have corollary 5 7 dom is weakly distinguishing on all the properties listed in example 3 2 similarly we get theorem 5 8 denote by ck the property of graphs of genus less than k then dom is weakly distinguishing on ck for all k n proof since p 5 and p 5 are planar from lemma c and corollary 5 4 we get that dom is weakly distinguishing on ck 6 the polynomial the polynomial introduced in 3 4 generalizes the matching and the tutte polynomial it is defined via a recurrence relation definition 6 1 let g be a graph define the tri variate polynomial g x y z using the recursive relation g x y z g e x y z y g e x y z z g e x y z 6 1 g th x y z g x y z h x y z with the base conditions k 1 x y z x and x y z 1 let g v g e g be a graph and a e g we denote by g a the graph v g a the spanning subgraph of a in g an alternative representation of the polynomial was introduced by trinks in 26 weakly distinguishing graph polynomials on addable properties 11 definition 6 2 letg be a graph the covered components polynomial c g x y z of g is defined as c g x y z a e g xk g a y a zc g a were g a is the graph v g a k g a is the number of connected components of g a and c g a is the number of covered connected components of g a that is connected components in g a with at least one edge we sometimes write c g for c g x y z to simplify long expressions the two definitions are connected via the following result proposition 6 3 26 for all graphs g c g x y z g x y xyz xy 6 2 corollary 6 4 let g and h be graphs then c g x y z c h x y z if and only if g x y z h x y z we will use the following recurrence relation theorem 6 5 26 let g 1 g 2 be graphs and v 1 v g 1 v 2 v g 2 let h be the graph obtained from g 1 and g 2 by identifying v 1 with v 2 then the following holds c g 1 xz 2 x c g 1 c g 2 1 z 1 c g 1 c g 2 v 2 c g 1 v 1 c g 2 x z x c g 1 v 1 c g 2 v 2 6 3 consider the graph s in figure 5 figure 5 a tree with pseudosimilar vertices we use the graphs in figure 5 together with theorem 6 5 to prove lemma 6 6 let gv be a graph with a pendent appearance of s depicted in figure 5 rooted at v and let gu be the graph obtained from gv by replacing the pendant appearance of s rooted at v by a pendant appearance of s rooted at u then gv and gu are c mates 12 johann a makowsky and vsevolod rakita proof we apply relation 6 5 to gv with g 1 s and g 2 being the graph h 1 obtained from gv by replacing the pendant appearance of s with a single vertex w we get c gv 1 xz 2 x c s c h 1 1 z 1 c s c h 1 w c s v c h 1 x z x c s v c h 1 w 6 4 similarly we apply relation 6 5 to gu with g 1 s and g 2 being the graph h 2 obtained from gu by replacing the pendant appearance of s with a single vertex w we get c gu 1 xz 2 x c s c h 2 1 z 1 c s c h 2 w c s u c h x z x c s u c h 2 w note that h 1 h 2 h 1 w h 2 w and s v s u and hence c gv c gu as a direct consequence of lemma 6 6 and corollary 6 4 we have corollary 6 7 let gv be a graph with a pendent appearance of s depicted in figure 5 rooted at v and let gu be the graph obtained from gv by replacing the pendant appearance of s rooted at v by a pendant appearance of s rooted at u then gv and gu are mates thus we have theorem 6 8 let a be a small addable graph property such that s a then is weakly distinguishing on a proof from lemma b and corollary 6 7 we get that is weakly distinguishing on a corollary 6 9 let a be a proper minor closed addable graph property then is weakly distinguishing on a proof note that since all forests are in a s a and hence from theorems 6 8 and 3 5 m is weakly distinguishing on a as in the previous section we get corollary 6 10 is weakly distinguishing on all the properties listed in example 3 2 similarly we get theorem 6 11 denote by ck the class of graphs of genus less than k then is weakly distinguishing on ck for all k n proof since s is a tree from lemmas c and 6 7 we get that is weakly distin guishing on ck weakly distinguishing graph polynomials on addable properties 13 7 invariants in this section we investigate consequences of theorems 6 8 and 6 11 by using lemma a from theorem 6 8 we get corollary 7 1 let a be a small addable graph property such that s a and let p be a graph polynomial such that p cs d p then p is weakly distinguishing on a corollary 7 2 let a be a proper minor closed addable graph property and let p be a graph polynomial such that p cs d p then p is weakly distinguishing on a from theorem 6 11 we get corollary 7 3 let ck the class of graphs of genus less than k and let p be a graph polynomial such that p cs d p then p is weakly distinguishing on ck for all k n in the sequel of this section we collect results from the literature which show that there are many graph polynomials p where we can apply this among them we find the i generalized chromatic polynomial from 8 including the chromatic polyno mial ii the matching polynomials iii independence polynomial including the vertex cover polynomial iv tutte polynomial including the flow polynomial the reliability polynomial and the euler polynomial 7 1 the generalized chromatic polynomial the generalized chromatic poly nomial gc g x y was introduced in 8 there are two disjoint sets of colors y the set of proper colors and z a generalized coloring of a graph g v e is a map c v y t z such that for all u v e if c u y and c v y then c u c v for two positive integers x y the value of the polynomial gc g x y is the number of generalized colorings by x colors where y of them are proper the chromatic polynomial g x is obtained for the case x y theorem 7 4 4 proposition 22 for all graphs g gc g x y g x 1 x y therefore cd p cg c d p 7 2 the matching polynomial there are several variants of the matching poly nomial considered in the literature definition 7 5 let g be a graph with n vertices a matching in g is a spanning subgraph of g in which every connected component is either an isolated vertex or two vertices connected by a single edge we say a matching is of size k if it has exactly k edges denote by mk g the number of k matchings in g the matching acyclic polynomial also known as the matching defect polynomial is defined as g x bn 2 c k 0 1 kmk g xn 2 k 14 johann a makowsky and vsevolod rakita the matching generating polynomial is defined as g g x bn 2 c k 0 mk g x k the bivariate matching polynomial of g is defined as m g w 1 w 2 bn 2 c k 0 mk g w n 2 k 1 w k 2 for an introduction to the bivariate matching polynomial see 9 for a recent survey on the acyclic matching polynomial see 11 for our purposes we note the following fact fact 7 1 all of the polynomials in definition 7 5 are of the same distinctive power on similar graphs s d p g s d p m in fact we also have d p m but for the edgless graphs en of order n we have g en x g em for all m n 1 but en 6 em thus we will only consider the bivariate matching polynomial theorem 7 6 4 proposition 20 for all graphs g m g x y g x 0 y therefore m s d p 7 3 independence and clique polynomial the independence polynomial is defined as in g x a e g x a where the graph induced graph g a is edgless the vertex cover polynomial v g x is defined as v c g x a e g x a where a is a vertex cover of g the following is taken from but possibly not originally due to 26 proposition 7 7 for all graphs g we have i in g x gc g x 1 1 ii v c g x xnin g 1 x hence v c s d p in s d p gc the clique polynomial is defined as cl g x a e g x a where the graph induced graph g a is a complete graph we note that in g x cl g for simple graphs therefore in d p cl by example 2 2 iii weakly distinguishing graph polynomials on addable properties 15 both in g x and cl g x were shown in 15 to be weakly distinguishing on all finite graphs in the light of the above in g x is also weakly distinguishing on small addable graph properties and on graphs of genus at most k this also holds if c is addable small and closed under complements if c is addable and small but not closed under complements we can use the following lemma figure 6 a path of length 3 lemma 7 8 let gr be a graph such that g has a pendant appearance of p 3 see figure 6 rooted at r and gu the graph obtained from gr by replacing the pendant appearance of p 3 by a pendant appearance of p 3 rooted at u then gr and gu are clique mates proof for all k 2 gr and gu have the same number of k cliques since no k clique can include vertices from the pendant appearance and g and g have the same number of vertices and edges and hence the same number of 1 and 2 cliques so cl gr x cl gu x thus we have theorem 7 9 let a be a small addable graph property such that p 3 a then cl is weakly distinguishing on a proof from lemmas b and 7 8 we get that cl is weakly distinguishing on a 7 4 the tutte polynomial let g v g e g be a graph and a e g we denote by g a the graph v g a k a is the number of connected compo nents of g a the tutte polynomial t g x y is defined by t g x y a e g x 1 k a k e y 1 k a a v g the partition function z g q w is defined by z g q w a e g qk f w f they are related by the equation t g x y x 1 k e y 1 v g z g x 1 y 1 y 1 the chromatic polynomial g x can be obtained from the tutte polynomial by g x 1 v g k g xk g t g 1 x 0 from this we get proposition 7 10 s d p t s d p z d p c d p 16 johann a makowsky and vsevolod rakita a graph is eulerian if all its vertices have even degree it does not have to be connected the euler polynomial e g x of a graph is defined by e g x a e g v a is eulerian x a from 1 chapter 10 p 468 we get that it is related to the tutte polynomial by e g x 1 x e g v g k g x v g k g t g 1 x 1 x 1 x hence we get proposition 7 11 e s d p t the flow polynomial fl g x and the reliability polynomial r g p are related to the tutte polynomial by fl g x 1 e g v g k g t g 0 1 x r g p p e g v g k g 1 p v g k g t g 1 1 p hence we get proposition 7 12 fl s d p t and r s d p t 8 conclusion we have shown that many graph polynomials are weakly distinguishing on all proper minor closed addable graph properties including many interesting properties such as planar graphs graphs with tree width at most k and kk free graphs for 4 k n in addition we proved that the domination characteristic and the edge elimination polynomial g x y z are weakly distinguishing on the properties of graphs with genus less then k for all k n this also applies to graph polynomials derivable from such as the generalized chromatic polynomial tutte polynomial and its variants the matching the independence and the clique polynomials our results relied on the fact that proper minor closed addable properties are in a sense small and so they do not settle the question whether the domination characteristic or tutte polynomials are weakly distinguishing almost complete or otherwise on all graphs we have shown that for the above graph polynomials p the sequence cp n ucp n c n tends to 0 as n tends to infinity the following questions are natural extensions of the work in this paper problem 8 1 what can be said about cp n when c is assumed to be a hereditary or monotone graph property problem 8 2 can we find a graph polynomial p and a graph property c such that we can prove that cp n for all sufficiently large n for some fixed 0 1 problem 8 3 for p one of the above polynomials and a a proper minor closed addable property select a random graph gn uniformly at random in an and denote gn h an p g p h what can be said about the limit distribution of the random variable gn weakly distinguishing graph polynomials on addable properties 17 references 1 martin aigner a course
