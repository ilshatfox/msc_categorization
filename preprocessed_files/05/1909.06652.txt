the steady state degree and mixed volume of a chemical reaction network elizabeth gross university of hawai i at manoa cvetelina hill georgia institute of technology april 27 2020 abstract the steady state degree of a chemical reaction network is the number of complex steady states which is a measure of the algebraic complexity of solving the steady state system in general the steady state degree may be difficult to compute here we give an upper bound to the steady state degree of a reaction network by utilizing the underlying polyhedral geometry associated with the corresponding polynomial system we focus on three case studies of infinite families of networks each generated by joining smaller networks to create larger ones for each family we give a formula for the steady state degree and the mixed volume of the corresponding polynomial system 1 introduction chemical reaction networks crns under the assumption of mass action kinetics are deterministic polynomial systems commonly used in systems biology to model mechanisms such as inter and intracellular signaling in this paper we study the newton polytopes of the steady state system of several reaction networks the ge ometry of these polytopes can inform us about the steady state degree of the network and consequently the algebraic complexity of exploring regions of multistationarity one way to evaluate whether a given reaction network is an appropriate model for a biological process is to consider its capacity for multiple positive real steady states if a reaction network has this capacity we call the network multistationary multistationarity for reaction networks with mass action kinetics has been extensively studied see js 15 with algebraic methods playing a key role dic 16 once multistationarity is established then bounds on the number of real posi tive steady states bdg 18 fh 18 mfr 16 ostt 19 and the regions of multista tionarity can be explored cfmw 17 cik 18 gbd 18 ghrs 16 one method to 1 ar x iv 1 90 9 06 65 2 v 2 m at h c o 2 3 a pr 2 02 0 explore regions of multistationarity which is used in ghrs 16 and cik 18 is to sample parameters in a systematic way and repeatedly solve the steady state system the steady state system of a reaction network is the parameterized polynomial sys tem formed by the steady state equations and the conservation equations solving steady state systems can be done numerically using solvers based on polynomial ho motopy continuation such as bertini bhsw 13 phcpack ver 99 and hom 4 ps 2 llt 08 such solvers will return all complex solutions and so a final step requires filtering for real positive solutions we call the number of complex steady states for generic rate constants and initial conditions the steady state degree of a chemical reaction network the steady state degree is not only a bound on the number of real positive steady states but is also a measure of the algebraic complexity of solving the steady state system for a given reaction network the steady state degree is similar to the maximum likelihood degree studied in algebraic statistics chks 06 and the euclidean distance degree studied in optimization dho 16 the former is a mea sure of the algebraic complexity of maximum likelihood estimation and the latter is a measure of the algebraic complexity of minimizing the distance between a point and a variety from the viewpoint of using numerical algebraic geometry to explore regions of multistationarity the steady state degree is the number of paths that need to be tracked when using a parameter homotopy to solve the steady state system and can serve as a stopping criterion for monodromy based solvers such as the one described in dhj 18 using the steady state degree as motivation in this paper we study the polyhedral geometry associated to the steady state and conservation equations in many cases particularly when there are many variables involved the steady state degree of a family of networks can be difficult to establish however we can provide an upper bound by the be zout bound and in the absence of boundary solutions the mixed volume of the polynomial system arising from the chemical reaction network as an example the mixed volume was used to bound the steady state degree of a model of erk regulation in ostt 19 in this paper we explore the mixed volumes of reaction networks further giving formulas for three families of networks in particular we study the combinatorics of the newton polytopes and their minkowski sums that arise for three infinite families of networks the three infinite families of chemical reaction networks that we study are con structed by successively building on smaller networks to create larger ones the base network for each family is the cell death model from hh 10 the edelstein network mfplv 10 and the one site phosphorylation cycle see for example motif a in fw 12 for each network we compute the mixed volume and steady state degree of the networks using various techniques such as explicit computation reducing to semi mixed and unmixed volume computation che 17 and in the case of a random ized system constructing a unimodular triangulation as shown in table 1 each of these examples illustrate a different relationship 2 crn family be zout bound mixed volume steady state degree cluster model n n 2 n includes two for cell death boundary sols edelstein 2 n 1 3

paper see theorems 3 7 3 10 and 3 12 propositions 3 2 3 3 3 4 3 6 and 3 11 and conjecture 3 17 between the steady state degree and the mixed volume of the the steady state system for the first family based on a cluster model for cell death we see that that the steady state degree is actually slightly larger than the mixed volume due to the presence of boundary steady states in the second family based on the edelstein model the mixed volume and steady state degree agree in the third family multisite distributive phosphorylation we see that the mixed volume is quadratic in the number of sites while the steady state degree is linear in the number of sites the most significant of these three case studies is the exploration of the multisite distributive phosphorylation system in section 3 3 the n site distributive phosphory lation system can be obtained by successively gluing together n copies of the one site phosphorylation cycle ghms 18 the regions of multistationarity of this network have been been recently investigated e g see bdg 18 cik 18 hfc 13 in the field of chemical reaction network theory in addition the number of real positive solutions has been well studied for example the authors of ws 08 show that the number of real positive solutions is bounded above by 2 n 1 and below by n 1 when n is even and n when n is odd furthermore the authors of fhc 14 show that the 2 n 1 bound can be achieved when n 3 and n 4 while the authors of grmd 19 describe parameter regions where the steady state system has n 1 real positive solutions when n is even and n when n is odd in section 3 3 we give the mixed volume of the randomized steady state system of n site distributive phosphory lation the randomized system is a square system obtained from the overdetermined steady state system by taking random combinations of the polynomials determining the mixed volume requires computing the normalized volume of a 3 n 3 dimensional 0 1 polytope with 5 n 4 vertices and 3 n 7 facets at the end of section 3 3 we show that this polytope of interest is the matching polytope of a graph the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we give the necessary background definitions and motivation in section 3 we systematically explore each of the three families of networks 3 2 background motivation a chemical reaction network n s c r is a triple where s a 1 a 2 an is a set of n chemical species c y 1 y 2 yp is a set of p complexes finite nonnegative integer combinations of the species and r yi yj yi yj c is a set of r reactions each complex in c can be written in the form yi 1 a 1 yi 2 a 2 yinan where yij z 0 and thus we will view the elements of c as vectors in zn 0 i e yi yi 1 yi 2 yin additionally to each complex of the chemical reaction network we associate a monomial xyi x yi 1 a 1 x yi 2 a 2 xyinan where xai xai t represents the concentration for species ai with respect to time for example for the reaction a b 4 b c the monomials corresponding to the reactant a b and the prod uct 4 b c are xaxb and x 4 bxc respectively with exponent vectors y 1 1 1 0 and y 2 4 0 1 let yi yj be the reaction from the i th to the j th complex to each reaction we associate a reaction vector yj yi that gives the net change in each species due to the reaction moreover each reaction has an associated positive reaction rate constant kij given a chemical reaction network s c r and a choice of kij rr 0 the system of polynomial ordinary differential equations under the assumption of mass action kinetics is dx dt yi yj r kijx yi yj yi f x x rn 1 setting the left hand side of the odes above equal to zero gives us a set of polynomial equations that we call the steady state equations the stoichiometric subspace associated with the chemical reaction network n s c r is a vector subspace of rn spanned by the reaction vectors yj yi denoted by sn r yj yi yi yj r 2 given initial conditions c rn the stoichiometric compatibility class is the affine space sn c and the conservation equations of n are the set of linear equations defining sn c in this paper we are concerned with the parameterized system of equations formed by the steady state and conservation equations which we call the steady state system we view the polynomials of the steady state system as polynomials in the ring q k c x 1 xn when the solution set of this polynomial system is zero dimensional for generic parameters k and c we define the number of complex solutions to the system for generic parameters as the steady state degree of n where we distinguish boundary steady states as complex solutions x cn such that xi 0 for one or more i 1 n 4 the steady state degree can be computed symbolically using gro bner bases or numerically using polynomial homotopy continuation however both these methods become computationally expensive when a large number of species are involved in such cases we would like to know an upper bound on the degree two such bounds are the be zout bound and the bernhtein kushnirenko khovanskii bkk bound given a zero dimensional polynomial system p f 1 fm with fi q x 1 xn the be zout bound on the number of solutions in cn is the product of the degrees of all the polynomials in the system the bkk bound on the number of solutions in c n is the mixed volume of p which requires p to be a square system i e a system of n equations in n variables in this case m n the mixed volume of p is the mixed volume of the newton polytopes of f 1 fn i e it is the coefficient of the term 1 n in the expansion of vol 1 newt f 1 n newt fn chen provides sufficient conditions under which the mixed volume of the newton polytopes is the normalized volume of the convex hull of their union we state these results below and reference them later in this note theorem 2

give the steady state degree the be zout bound and the mixed volume of the steady state systems employing these results and other standard techniques 5 3 three families of networks in what follows we investigate three infinite families of reaction networks the second two families result from successively joining or gluing smaller networks to form a larger network as defined in ghms 18 the first two families in this study showcase different methods that can be used to understand the steady state degree while the third family mulitisite distributive sequential phosphorylation requires more sophisticated methods in particular in the third case study we describe the polytopeqn obtained by taking the convex hull of the exponent vectors of the support of the system we compute the normalized volume of qn which bounds the number of non boundary steady states this computation is done by first establishing the h representation of qn and then explicitly constructing a regular unimodular triangulation of qn 3 1 cell death model the first case study is a model representing the cell death mechanism as described in hh 10 we consider these cluster stabilization reactions involving unstable and stable open receptors where each network of the family has two species y and z the unstable and stable receptors respectively the nth reaction network in this family denoted cdn has n complexes ci of the form ci n i y iz with i 1 n and n n 1 2 reactions ci ki j cj such that i j the polynomial system associated to cdn consists of one linear conservation equation in the variables xy and xz and their initial conditions c cy cz and two steady state equations one for each species specifically the polynomial system of interest is f 1 xy xz cy cz f 2 x y n i j i 6 j j i ki jx j y x n j z f 3 x z n i j i 6 j j i ki jx j y x n j z 3 since x z x y there is only one unique steady state equation of degree n in this example both the be zout and bkk bounds are linear in n with the bkk bound being slightly lower in proposition 3 4 we show that the steady state degree including boundary solutions is given by the be zout bound see remark 3 5 example 3 1 for n 4 the cell death model has two species four complexes and six reactions figure 1 shows the reaction graph for this model the polynomial system for cd 4 consists of one conservation equation and two steady state equations 6

we have a square system in two variables 4 proposition 3 2 the be zout bound for the chemical reaction network cdn is n proof the be zout bound can be seen from the system 3 there are always three equations one linear and two of degree n however the two degree n equations are identical hence we have two equations and the be zout bound is n proposition 3 3 the polynomial system corresponding to the chemical reaction net work cdn has mixed volume n 2 7 the proof of this result requires a direct computation of the mixed volume of the system there are two newton polytopes for any n one of which is a line segment hence the computation is straightforward recall that the mixed volume of m poly topes q 1 qm rn is mv q 1 qm which is the coefficient of 1 2 m in the expansion of voln 1 q 1 2 q 2 mqm with i 0 proof consider the system 3 for a network of type cdn for some n 1 as discussed earlier we can consider only the first two polynomials f 1 and f 2 whose newton polytopes in r 2 are n 1 conv 1 0 0 1 0 0 n 2 conv 1 n 1 2 n 2 n 2 2 n 1 1 5 note that n 1 is a triangle of area 1 2 and n 2 is a line of length 2 n 2 in this case the mixed volume of 3 is the coefficient of 1 2 in the following expansion vol 2 1 n 1 2 n 2 vol 2 n 1 2 1 2 vol 2 n 1 n 2 1 2 vol 2 n 2 2 2 1 2 0 6 implying that vol 2 n 1 n 2 1 2 vol 2 n 1 n 2 vol 2 n 1 vol 2 n 2 7 since n 1 is an equilateral right triangle of side length one we have that vol 2 n 1 1 2 and because n 2 is a line it follows that vol 2 n 2 0 the polytope n 1 n 2 is the minkowski sum of the two newton polytopes n 1 and n 2 that is n 1 n 2 conv a b a n 1 b n 2 the minkowski sum of a line segment and an equilateral right triangle is a trapezoid as shown in figure 3 for n 4 the two bases of the trapezoid have length 2 n 2 and 2 n 1 and the height of the trapezoid is 1 2 hence the area of n 1 n 2 is vol 2 n 1 n 2 2 2 n 3 2 1 2 2 n 3 2 8 and from 7 we have that vol 2 n 1 n 2 n 2 2 thus the coefficient of 1 2 in 6 is n 2 which is precisely mv n 1 n 2 proposition 3 4 for the chemical reaction network cdn there are n steady states including two boundary steady states proof based on the discussion following 3 we wish to solve a square polynomial system in two variables with one linear equation and one equation of degree n this is easily done with elimination using the linear conservation equation we can express 8 one of the indeterminates say xz in terms of xy that is xz cy cz xy observe that we can factor out xy xz in x y and substitute the expression for xz this results in two boundary solutions of the form xz yz 0 cy cz cy cz 0 and n 2 complex solutions in c 2 hence there are n steady states including the boundary steady states remark 3 5 based on proposition 3 4 there are more steady states than the mixed volume predicts this is not contradictory since the mixed volume gives a bound on the solutions in the torus c n while the steady state degree counts all solutions of the polynomial system when there are boundary steady states i e solutions with some zero entries the steady state degree may be larger than the mixed volume 3 2 edelstein model the edelstein model was proposed by b edelstein in 1970 ede 70 it is known to exhibit multiple real positive steady states mfplv 10 and thus is an example of a multistationary network we study the behavior of the steady state degree of the network after gluing n copies of the edelstein model over shared complexes see ghms 18 for more details on gluing we denote the new network en this model is of particular interest because although the be zout bound is exponential in the number of species the mixed volume bound is constant and is achieved for all n to construct en we start with the edelstein model e 1 itself a 2 a a b b 1 b then beginning at i 2 and continuing until i n each step is defined by adding one new species bi and four reactions gluing over the complexes a b and b for instance for n 2 the network e 2 would have the form a 2 a a b b 1 b a b b 2 b in general the nth reaction network in this family has n 2 species n 4 complexes and 4 n 2 reactions the corresponding polynomial system consists of one conservation equation and n 2 differential equations f 1 xb cb n i 1 xbi cbi f 2 k 10 x 2 a k 23 k 25 k 2 n 3 xaxb k 01 xa k 32 xb 1 k 52 xb 2 kn 3 2 xbn f 3 k 23 k 25 k 2 n 3 xaxb k 43 k 45 k 4 n 3 xb k 32 k 34 xb 1 kn 3 2 kn 3 4 xbn f 4 k 23 xaxb k 43 xb k 32 k 34 xb 1 fn 3 k 2 n 3 xaxb k 4 n 3 xb kn 3 2 kn 3 4 xbn 9 observe that only n 1 of the differential equations are needed to define the steady state system as there is a linear dependence between f 3 fn 3 namely f 3 9 n 3 i 4 fi despite the exponential be zout bound shown in proposition 3 6 it turns out that the mixed volume of the polynomial system 9 is constant and it is achieved as the steady state degree proposition 3 6 the chemical reaction network en has a be zout bound of 2 n 1 proof there are n 3 equations in the system where one equation is linear and the rest n 2 are quadratic since f 3 n 1 i 4 fi we can drop the polynomial f 3 and we are left with n 1 quadratic equations this gives us a be zout bound of 2 n 1 theorem 3 7 the mixed volume of the polynomial system corresponding to en is 3 example 3 8 before we give a proof to theorem 3 7 we give details for n 1 the polynomial system for e 1 is f 1 xb xb 1 cb cb 1 f 2 x a k 1 0 x 2 a k 0 1 xa k 2 3 xaxb k 3 2 xb 1 f 3 x b k 2 3 xaxb k 3 2 xb 1 k 3 4 xb 1 k 4 3 xb f 4 x b 1 k 2 3 xaxb k 3 2 xb 1 k 3 4 xb 1 k 4 3 xb 10 let si be the support of fi i 1 4 and qi conv si where f 4 f 3 so we consider only f 3 for ease of notation we write 101 for 1 0 1 then the supports of the three polynomials are s 1 000 010 001 s 2 200 110 100 001 s 3 110 010 001 11 let s s 1 s 2 s 3 and q conv s see figure 5 we will show that the collection of sets in 11 satisfies the hypothesis of che 17 theorem 2 let f be a facet of q which is a pyramid with a trapezoidal base if f is one of the lateral facets then f contains 001 which is a member of each set si i 1 2 3 if f is the base of the pyramid then f si 6 i 1 2 3 since f contains at least two elements from each set si if f is an edge containing 001 then f si 6 i 1 2 3 the edges containing 001 are the lateral edges we now consider the four edges of the base of q in the case when f conv 110 010 we have that f si 6 for all i otherwise when f is one of the other three edges condition b of che 17 theorem 2 is satisfied since for at least one i 1 2 3 f si is a singleton hence each face of q satisfies either condition a or b of che 17 theorem 2 and therefore the mixed volume of the system in 10 is the same as the normalized volume of the convex hull of the union of the newton polytopes of the corresponding system that is mv q 1 q 2 q 3 3 vol 3 q 12 10 figure 4 unimodular triangulation of the trapezoidal base of q in example 3 8 figure 5 the polytope q conv s from example 3 8 and its unimodular triangu lation the euclidean volume of q is the number of simplices contained in a unimodular regu lar triangulation ofq times the normalized volume of a unimodular three dimensional simplex which is 1 3 to see the triangulation first we note that q is a pyramid with a trapezoidal base this base has a unimodular triangulation containing three simplices see figure 4 to construct q we simply add the vertex 001 and cone over the existing simplices see figure 5 hence there are 3 simplices each with volume 1 3 by 12 we have that mv q 1 q 2 q 3 3 3 1 3 3 4 13 to prove theorem 3 7 we use results from che 17 to compute the mixed volume of the polynomial system in 9 consider 9 and let si newt fi we relabel the polynomials fi by omitting f 3 and letting fj fi 1 for i 4 let qi conv si i 1 n 2 and for n 2 let s s 3 sn 2 q conv s and q conv s where s n 2 i 1 si lemma 3 9 let n 2 and consider the chemical reaction network en and the corresponding polynomial system 9 then mv q 1 qn 2 n 2 voln 2 q 14 11 proof the mixed volume computation in this case can be reduced to a semi mixed volume computation where some of the polytopes are identical first we want to show that mv q 1 qn 2 mv q 1 q 2 q q n let the indeterminates of 9 be ordered lexicographically xa xb xb 1 xbn and let ei be the corresponding exponent vetor for each monomial we write e 0 for the zero vector in rn 2 and eij for ei ej where i j a b b 1 bn after the aforementioned relabeling the supports of the fis i 1 n 2 in 9 are s 1 e 0 eb eb 1 ebn s 2 2 ea eab ea eb 1 ebn s 3 eab eb eb 1 15 sn 2 eab eb ebn observe that s 3 sn 2 differ by one element only hence they meet the criterion in che 17 corollary 1 implying that mv q 1 qn 2 mv q 1 q 2 q q n 16 now the mixed volume of the system with support 15 is the same as the mixed volume of the system below s 1 e 0 eb eb 1 ebn s 2 2 ea ea eab eb 1 ebn s j eab eb eb 1 ebn j 3 n 2 17 we want to show that the collection of s i i 1 n 2 satisfies the hypothesis of che 17 theorem 2 let f be a positive dimensional face of q if any of the vertices of f are in s n 2 i 1 si then f s i 6 for all i 1 n 2 in this case f satisfies theorem 2 2 i suppose that none of the vertices of f are in s then they must be in the set difference d s s e 0 eb 2 ea ea eab note that ea d is in the interior of the edge e 0 2 ea so it is not a vertex suppose that the vertices of f are all of d ea then f s i 6 for all i and we are in case i of theorem 2 2 if the vertices of f are a smaller subset of d ea then f must be an edge there are four such edges and for each one of them either f s i 6 for all i or for some j we have that f s j is a singleton in this case we meet condition ii of the theorem hence we have that mv q 1 qn 2 n 2 voln 2 q 18 12 proof of theorem 3 7 to compute the volume of q we construct a unimodular tri angulation recall that the euclidean volume of an n dimensional unimodular sim plex is 1 n the vertices of q are e 0 2 ea eab eb ebi where i 1 n note that all ej j a b bi are the 0 1 unit vectors in rn 2 and that vectors ebi are linearly independent this means that we can work with the polytope p conv e 0 2 ea eab eb r 2 after constructing a unimodular triangulation of p we cone over it with each of the vertices ebi i 1 n this process preserves unimodularity as shown in figure 4 p is a trapezoid consisting of three unimodular simplices each with area 1 2 1 2 in particular we have 1 conv 00 10 01 2 conv 10 01 11 3 conv 10 20 11 19 as we cone over the existing triangulation with each ebi the number of simplices remains the same see figure 5 for example thus q has three n 2 dimensional simplices each with volume 1 n 2 hence by lemma 3 9 it follows that mv q 1 qn 2 n 2 voln 2 q n 2 3 n 2 3 20 theorem 3 10 the steady state degree of the chemical reaction network en is 3 proof we use elimination to reduce the system to a univariate cubic polynomial in xa the elimination algorithm is easy to see fore 1 the corresponding system 10 contains four polynomials in three variables with f 4 f 3 so we can reduce the system to three polynomials by forgetting f 4 using f 1 we solve for xb 1 as a linear expression in xb subtracting f 3 from f 2 and substituting for xb 1 in the difference we can solve for xb and in turn for xb 1 as a quadratic in xa lastly substituting for all variables in terms of xa in f 2 results in a univariate cubic polynomial in xa hence there are exactly three equilibrium solutions to 10 the polynomial system for n 2 has the general form of 9 similarly to the first case using equations f 4 fn 3 for each i 1 n we can express xbi as a bilinear expression in xa and xb these expressions can then be substituted in f 1 from where we can solve for xb and respectively all xbi as a rational expression in terms of xa with a quadratic numerator and a linear denominator in xa these operations are defined since we assume that the collection of kijs is generic and hence no linear combination is zero moreover we assume that xa is nonzero substituting the rational expressions for xb and xbi into f 2 and clearing the denominators results in a univariate cubic polynomial in xa hence there are three solutions to the system i e the steady state degree is 3 this result along with lemma 3 9 shows that the bkk bound is tight for all n 13 s 0 e x 1 e s 1 s 1 f y 1 s 0 f s 1 e x 2 e s 2 s 2 f y 2 s 1 f sn 1 e xn sn e sn f yn sn 1 f complex

since they are linear combinations of other polynomials from the system let p n be the polynomial system for the reaction network pcn consisting of the 3 n 4 equations from 21 and 22 set equal to zero proposition 3 11 the be zout bound for the reaction network pcn is 2 3 n 1 proof note that each of the 3 n 1 polynomial odes in 22 is quadratic and each of the three conservation equations in 21 is linear hence the be zout bound for the system p n is 2 3 n 1 since p n is overdetermined to compute the mixed volume and compare it with the be zout bound we consider the randomized system pn m p n where m c 3 n 3 3 n 4 is a generic matrix note that every solution of p n is a solution of pn so the mixed volume of pn still provides an upper bound on the number solutions of p n in c n the system pn is a square system with 3 n 3 equations where each polynomial is a linear combination of the polynomials fi i 1 3 n 4 15 for the remainder of this section we work with the system pn where each poly nomial has support sn 3 n 4 i 1 si for si supp fi i 1 3 n 4 let qn conv sn be the newton polytope of each polynomial of pn this leads to the main theorem of this section theorem 3 12 let pn be the randomized polynomial system for the reaction network pcn then mv qn qn 3 n 3 3 n 3 vol 3 n 3 qn n 1 n 4 2 1 23 the first equality of 23 follows from the definition of mixed volume in the special case when all polytopes are identical to prove the second equality we construct a triangulation tn of the polytope qn provided tn is unimodular i e all simplices are unimodular the normalized euclidean volume of qn is the number of simplices in tn first we give a description of the vertices of qn followed by a hyperplane representation of qn which aids in the construction of the triangulation tn with the desired number of simplices we illustrate theorem 3 12 with an example for n 1 example 3 13 the reaction network for n 1 is s 0 e x 1 s 1 e s 1 f y 1 s 0 f and the corresponding polynomial

1 q 1 6 6 vol 6 q 1 observe that e 3 and e 6 are linearly independent from the rest of the vertices as vectors in order to simplify computations we will project away e 3 and e 6 and relabel the vertices we will study the new polytope k 1 conv v 1 in r 4 where v 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 v 0 v 1 v 4 v 12 v 34 then we will cone over the triangulation of k 1 with e 3 and then e 6 to recover q 1 to compute the volume of k 1 we construct a placing triangulation t 1 which is unimod ular see the proof of lemma 3 16 and dl 10 got 17 for more details we begin the triangulation by placing the first five vertices v 0 v 4 which form a standard simplex in r 4 let 1 conv v 0 v 4 next we place the vertex v 12 note that v 12 6 1 but it is in the affine hull of 1 we consider the facets of 1 visible from v 12 where the only such facet is f 1 conv v 1 v 4 since all other facets lie on the coordinate hyperplanes we cone over f 1 with v 12 and obtain the simplex 2 conv v 1 v 4 v 12 lastly we place v 34 and observe that v 34 is not in the convex hull of v 0 v 1 v 4 v 12 but it is in their affine hull none of the facets of 1 are visible from v 34 but two of the facets of 2 are visible f 21 conv v 1 v 3 v 4 v 12 and f 22 conv v 2 v 3 v 4 v 12 we cone over each one with v 34 constructing two more simplices 3 conv f 21 v 34 and 4 conv f 22 v 34 the collection t 1 4 i 1 i is a triangulation of k 1 by construction moreover by a similar proof as the one for lemma 3 16 t 1 is a unimodular triangulation to construct a triangulation of q 1 we embed k 1 in r 6 and then we cone over each i with e 3 and then e 6 this gives t 1 4 i 1 si where s 1 conv e 0 e 6 s 2 conv e 1 e 6 e 12 s 3 conv e 1 e 3 e 4 e 5 e 6 e 12 e 45 s 4 conv e 2 e 3 e 4 e 5 e 6 e 12 e 45 the triangulation t 1 remains unimodular hence the normalized euclidean volume of each simplex is 1 6 and mv q 1 q 1 6 6 vol 6 q 1 6 4 6 4 n 1 n 4 2 1 4 17 now lets consider the general case where the dimension of the ambient space of qn is 3 n 3 let ei r 3 n 3 represent the ith standard unit vector e 0 be the zero vector and eij ei ej for 1 i d the vector ei is the exponent vector of ith indeterminate in the following ordered list xs 0 xe xx 1 xs 1 xf xy 1 xxj xsj xyj n j 2 of size 3 n 3 for n 1 and n 2 the vertices of q 1 and q 2 are given by the vec tor configurations e 0 e 1 e 6 e 12 e 45 and e 0 e 1 e 9 e 12 e 24 e 45 e 58 respectively going from the j 1 site phosphorylation network to the j site phosphorylation network j 2 we gain three new steady state equations and five new monomials xxj xsj xyj xsj 1 xe xsjxf hence for n 3 the vertices of qn are given by the 5 n 4 vectors of dimension 3 n 3 in the configuration vn e 0 e 1 e 3 n 3 e 12 e 24 e 28 e 2 3 n 7 e 2 3 n 4 e 45 e 58 e 5 3 n 1 e 5 3 n 2 25 proposition 3 14 let qn be the newton polytope of each polynomial in the system pn for n 2 the h representation of qn is given by 1 x 1 x 3 x 4 3 n 3 i 6 xi 0 1 x 1 x 3 x 5 n i 2 x 3 i x 3 i 1 x 3 n 3 0 1 x 2 x 3 x 5 n i 2 x 3 i x 3 i 1 x 3 n 3 0 1 x 2 x 3 n i 2 x 3 i x 3 i 1 x 3 n 2 x 3 n 3 0 xi 0 i 1 3 n 3 26 proof let qhn be the polytope defined by 26 we aim to show that qn and q h n coincide note that each coordinate xi i 1 3 n 3 is bounded in qhn in particular 0 xi 1 otherwise if xi 1 or xi 0 at least one of the multivariate resp univariate inequalities will be violated it remains to show that the vertex sets of qn and q h n coincide observe that none of the inequalities in 26 can be obtained by taking positive linear combinations of the remaining inequalities implying that 26 is an irredundant description of qhn hence each inequality defines a distinct facet zie 95 a vertex of the polytope qhn must be in the intersection of at least 3 n 3 hy perplanes described in 26 hence a vertex must satisfy a subsystem of 26 of size at least 3 n 3 3 n 3 at equality we begin by considering subsets of 3 n 3 inequalities whose corresponding linear systems are consistent 18 first consider all 3 n 3 univariate equations and set xi 0 for all i 1 3 n 3 this yields the origin e 0 as a vertex of q h n next select 3 n 2 variables xi set equal to zero and one of the four multivariate equations note that some of these combinations will result in an inconsistent system those yielding a consistent system will have a solution with each coordinate zero except one of the xis which will be 1 there are 3 n 3 distinct choices for the nonzero xi these choices yield the vertices e 1 e 3 n 3 thus far we have found 3 n 4 vertices of qhn and each is also a vertex of qn continuing in the same manner we now choose 3 n 1 variables xi set equal to zero and two of the four multivariate equations each of the nonzero variables must take the value 1 otherwise we would have 0 xi xj 1 where i 6 j implying that they appear together in both multivariate equations in this case each multivariate equa tion is reduced to 1 xi xj 0 however this system yields a positive dimensional face of qhn and hence does not describe a vertex thus both nonzero variables must be 1 and they cannot appear in the same multivariate equation independent of the choice of the two multivariate equations the pair xi xj will be a subset of the vari ables in the symmetric difference of their supports in particular there are 2 n distinct such choices x 1 x 2 x 2 x 4 x 4 x 5 x 2 x 3 j 2 x 5 x 3 k 2 for 2 j n 1 2 k n these combinations yield the 2 n vertices e 12 e 24 e 28 e 2 11 e 2 3 n 1 e 45 e 58 e 5 3 n 2 together with the previously found 3 n 4 vertices we have a total of 5 n 4 vertices of qhn which are exactly the vertices of qn shown in 25 it remains to show that qhn does not have any more vertices suppose that qhn has a vertex q 6 vn then since we considered all vertices of qhn with zero one or two nonzero entries q must have more than two nonzero entries now suppose that for distinct i j and k the entries qi qj and qk are all nonzero and the remaining 3 n entries of q are zero note that qi qj and qk must have value 1 otherwise q cannot satisfy a zero dimensional system constructed from the inequalities in 26 since qi qj qk the variables xi xj and xk cannot appear in the same inequality but there is no possible choice for three such variables implying it is also not possible to have more than three nonzero variables therefore we have found all vertices of qhn in particular they coincide with the vertex representation of qn hence qhn qn now we will compute the normalized euclidean volume of qn by constructing a unimodular triangulation let dn n 3 similar to example 3 13 we can reduce qn to a lower dimensional polytope kn rdn by projecting down 2 n dimensions corresponding to the vectors e 3 e 6 e 3 j 1 and e 3 j 3 2 j n these are the exponent vectors of the monomials xxj and xyj to avoid ambiguity of notation we relabel the standard unit vectors and their sums after the projection e g v 1 will be the 1 st standard unit vector in rdn and v 12 v 1 v 2 so kn conv vn where vn 3 n 4 and vn v 0 v 1 vdn v 12 v 23 v 25 v 2 dn 1 v 34 v 45 v 4 dn 27 19 following the ideas of example 3 13 we construct a placing triangulation tn of kn then we cone over tn with the 2 n remaining unit vectors from vn to recover a uni modular triangulation of qn we will construct tn by successively placing vertices after placing each vertex we will need information about the convex hull of the vertices already placed the following lemma describes these intermediate polytopes and is used in the construction of tn the proofs are omitted as they follow the same process and reasoning as the proof of proposition 3 14 lemma 3 15 let dn n 3 for each n let k n 1 be the embedding of kn 1 in rdn let k n conv k n 1 vdn and k n conv k n v 2 dn 1 then 1 the h representation of k n is 1 x 1 x 3 n j 2 xdj 0 1 x 1 x 4 xdn 0 1 x 2 x 4 xdn 0 1 x 2 xdn 1 xdn 0 xi 0 i 1 dn n 3 28 2 the h representation of k n is 1 x 1 x 3 n j 2 xdj 0 29 1 x 1 x 4 xdn 0 30 1 x 2 x 4 xdn 0 31 xi 0 i 1 dn 32 lemma 3 16 let n 2 and dj j 3 j n let t 1 be the triangulation of k 1 as described in example 3 13 let tn be the placing triangulation obtained from tn 1 by coning over the kn 1 simplices of tn 1 with apex vdn and placing v 2 dn 1 and v 4 dn in that order the simplices obtained by placing v 2 dn 1 and v 4 dn are kn 1 1 conv v 2 vdn 1 vdn v 12 v 23 v 25 v 2 dn 1 v 4 dn 1 kn 1 2 conv v 1 v 4 vdn v 12 v 34 v 45 v 4 dn kn 1 3 conv v 2 v 4 vdn v 12 v 23 v 25 v 2 dn 1 v 4 dn kn 1 4 conv v 2 vdn v 12 v 23 v 34 v 45 v 4 dn kn 1 5 kn 1 4 v 34 v 25 kn 1 dn 1 kn 1 dn 1 1 v 4 dn 1 1 v 2 dn 1 33 20 furthermore tn has kn 4 n 1 j 2 dj simplices and is unimodular proof the triangulation tn is obtained inductively beginning with the explicit con struction of t 1 in example 3 13 containing k 1 4 unimodular simplices suppose the triangulation tn 1 has been constructed by successively placing vertices as described in the statement of the lemma furthermore assume tn 1 contains kn 1 4 n 2 j 2 dj unimodular simplices as described in 33 we embed kn 1 and its triangulation tn 1 into rdn and place the vertices i vdn ii v 2 dn 1 and iii v 4 dn as follows i placing vdn placing vdn increases the dimension of the polytope kn 1 by one from dn 1 to dn we cone over all simplices of tn 1 with vdn and obtain the first kn 1 simplices of tn the resulting polytope is k n and its facet defining inequalities are given in 28 ii placing v 2 dn 1 consider the facet defining inequalities of k n in 28 note that the hyperplane 1 x 2 xdn 1 xdn 0 is the only one separating v 2 dn 1 and k n facets of k n contained in this hyperplane will be visible from v 2 dn 1 there is only one such facet namely f 2 dn 1 dn conv v 2 vdn 1 vdn v 12 v 23 v 25 v 2 dn 2 v 4 dn 1 containing dn vertices and hence it is a simplex of dimension dn 1 coning over f 2 dn 1 dn with v 2 dn 1 yields the dn dimensional simplex kn 1 1 the resulting polytope after placing v 2 dn 1 is k n whose facet defining inequalities are given in 29 32 iii placing v 4 dn we aim to show that in this step we add dn 1 1 new simplices investigating the facet defining inequalities of k n we note that there are two hyperplanes separating v 4 dn from k n namely 30 and 31 containing the respective facets f 1 4 dn conv v 1 v 4 vdn v 12 v 34 v 45 v 4 dn 1 f 2 4 dn conv v 2 v 4 vdn v 12 v 23 v 25 v 2 dn 1 v 34 v 45 v 4 dn 1 note that f 1 4 dn is a dn 1 dimensional simplex so coning over it with v 4 dn results in the dn dimensional simplex kn 1 2 the facet f 2 4 dn lies in the facet defining hyperplane 1 x 2 x 4 xdn 0 it has 2 dn 1 2 vertices and a unimodular triangulation induced by the triangulation of k n in particular the simplices in the triangulation of f 2 4 dn are kn 2 3 vdn 1 vdn kn 2 dn 2 vdn 1 vdn kn 1 1 vdn 1 these dn 1 dimensional simplices are obtained by considering the intersection of the simplices kn 2 1 vdn kn 2 dn 2 vdn kn 1 1 kn 1 2 of k n with the hyperplane 1 x 2 x 4 xdn 0 note that we do not need to consider 21 the remaining simplices of k n since each intersection with f 2 4 dn is necessarily of dimension less than dn 1 we cone over the triangulation of f 2 4 dn with v 4 dn and obtain the dn 2 1 dn 3 simplices kn 1 3 kn 1 dn 1 hence we have a total of kn kn 1 2 dn 3 kn 1 dn 1 4 n 1 j 2 dj simplices in tn finally we show that the placing triangulation tn is unimodular the polytope kn is a dn dimensional compressed polytope dl 10 implying that all of its pulling triangulations are unimodular a placing triangulation is equivalent to a pushing triangulation the latter is a regular triangulation with a lifting vector of heights j r where j is the set of labels on vn with respect to some order reversing the order of the labels of vn and the heights of the weight vector makes the pushing triangulation into a pulling triangulation got 17 dl 10 hence tn as constructed is a regular unimodular triangulation proof of theorem 3 12 the first equality in 23 follows from the definition of mixed volume in the special case when all polytopes are identical we aim to obtain a unimodular triangulation of qn by lemma 3 16 kn has a triangulation tn with 4 n 1 i 1 di 4 n 1 i 1 i 3 n 4 n 1 2 1 simplices to achieve a unimodular triangulation ofqn we cone over the triangulation tn in the 2 n originally collapsed dimensions which preserves the number of simplices the polytope qn has dimension 3 n 3 hence the normalized euclidean volume of each full dimensional unimodular simplex is 1 3 n 3 the second equality of 23 now follows the mixed volume for the randomized system of pcn is quadratic in n which is a tighter bound than the exponential be zout bound nonetheless for it is still significantly higher than the steady state degree of the ideal that we witness in com putation indeed based on numerical computations up to n 15 we conjecture the following for the steady state degree of pcn which is linear in n conjecture 3 17 the steady state degree of the chemical reaction network pcn is 2 n 1 22 figure 7 the graph gn qn pma gn figure 8 the graph g n kn pma g n remark 3 18 we note the authors of ws 08 show that the number of real positive solutions is bounded above by 2 n 1 by using a positive reparameterization along the way they introduce a polynomial with degree 2 n 1 with careful treatment we expect this polynomial could be used to establish steady state degree of pcn our exploration of qn reveals that newton polytopes of steady state equations are interesting combinatorially on their own indeed we finish our discussion of qn by showing that it is a matching polytope of a graph let gn be the multigraph on n 3 vertices with d 3 n 3 edges such that gn contains one four cycle n 1 edges incident with one node of the four cycle say s 1 and 2 n parallel edges connecting s 1 diagonally with s 3 see figure 8 for example each edge of gn represents a species of pcn the matching polytope of the graph gn is the convex hull of the incidence vectors of all matchings of gn i e pma gn conv m m is a matching ofgn a matching of gn is a subset of edges m e gn such that each vertex is incident with no more than one edge of m the incidence vector m 0 1 e gn of a matching m is mt 1 t m 0 otherwise each matching of the graph gn equivalently each vertex of pma gn corresponds to the support of a monomial in the dynamical polynomial system pn of 3 3 proposition 3 19 the polytope qn is the matching polytope of the graph gn de scribed above i e qn pma gn 23 proof the incidence vector of a matching of gn containing only one edge ti coincides with the standard vector ei with entry 1 in the ith position a matching of gn can contain at most two edges and each pair is either of the form mj t 2 tj j 1 4 8 11 3 n 1 or of the form m t 5 t 4 8 11 3 n 1 3 n 2 note that the incidence vectors of the matchings of type mj and m can be represented as e 2 j or e 5 for j as specified above hence the vertices of the matching polytope of gn are the same as the vertices of qn as given in 25 implying the two polytopes coincide let g n be the simple graph arising from gn by deleting the 2 n parallel edges t 3 i t 3 i 1 1 i n and relabeling the remaining edges then g n is the graph on n 3 vertices and n 3 edges proposition 3 20 the polytope kn is the matching polytope for g n i e kn pma g n proof similarly to the proof of proposition 3 19 we will show that the vertices of kn and pma g n are the same note that the matching for g n will be a subset of the matching of gn in particular there will be 2 n fewer singleton matchings resulting from the deletion of the 2 n parallel edges no two edge matching will be lost in the construction of g n from gn all single edge matchings correspond to the standard vectors ei for 1 i n 3 with e 0 representing the empty matching as in the proof of proposition 3 19 we have two edge matchings of types mj and m for j 1 3 5 6 n 1 and 3 5 6 n corresponding to the vertices v 2 j and v 4 from the vertex representation of kn given in 27 hence kn pma g n 4 acknowledgements elizabeth gross was supported by nsf dms 1620109 cvetelina hill was partially supported by nsf dms 1600569 additionally this material is based upon work
