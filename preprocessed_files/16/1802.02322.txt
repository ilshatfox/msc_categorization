all classes in the n torsion of br x are z n cyclic we show that in general not all classes are z n cyclic classes on the other hand if x has good reduction and n is prime to p of if x is an elliptic curve over qp with split multiplicative reduction and n is a power of p then we prove that all order n elements of br x are z n cyclic finally if x has good reduction and its function field k x contains all p 2 th roots of 1 we show the existence of indecomposable division algebras over k x with period p 2 and index p 3 1 introduction let p be a prime by a p adic curve x we mean a smooth geometrically connected projective curve over some finite extension k of qp let k x be the function field of x division algebras over k x have been extensively studied by many different authors see for instance sal 97 sal 98 hhk 09 bmt 11 ps 14 bmt 16 among others in this paper we focus on two different aspects about k x division algebras cyclicity and indecomposability we will be particularly interested in classes of azumaya algebras over x classified by the brauer group of x as much as possible we will try to tackle the thorny part of br k x namely its p primary component for which fewer techniques are available and much less is known about let f be any field let n n be prime to charf and write br f n for the n torsion of the brauer group br f of f a central simple f algebra is called z n cyclic if it contains a maximal z n cyclic galois e tale subalgebra then its class in br f n can be written as the cup product of an element in h 1 f n f n and a character in h 1 f z n we call such classes z n cyclic as well cyclic algebras are the simplest amongst all central simple algebras and it is known that for a local or global field f all classes in br f n are z n cyclic for the function field k x of a p adic curve x it is known that not all elements in br k x n are z n cyclic see the appendix of sal 97 by w jacob and j p tignol for a counter example when n 2 and p 6 2 in bmt 16 it was shown that for n prime to p any class in br k x n is the sum of at most two z n cyclic classes that result led the author to consider the question of whether all classes in the subgroup br x n of br k x n are z n cyclic or not it is not difficult to show that if x has good reduction see subsection 3 3 for the definition and n is prime to p then all classes in br x n are z n cyclic this is done in theorem 13 however the answer to the above question is negative in general in 2010 mathematics subject classification 16 k primary 14 g secondary key words and phrases brauer group p adic curves cyclic algebras 1 http arxiv org abs 1802 02322 v 2 2 eduardo tengan section 5 for almost all p 1 mod 3 we show the existence of a p adic curve x of genus 10 having bad reduction and a class in br x 3 that is not z 3 cyclic since we believe this construction to be of interest on its own we made an extra effort to identify and isolate the main points that make it work proving results in a bit more generality than actually needed in the last two sections we obtain results that also work for the p primary part of br k x in section 6 we study cyclicity for the brauer group of an elliptic curve e with split multiplicative reduction using tate s p adic uniformization and lichtembaum s duality we show in theorem 25 that all classes in br e n are z n cyclic if n is either prime or satisfies gcd n k 1 where k is the group of roots of unity in k as an interesting corollary we get that if e is defined over qp then all classes in br e p r are z pr cyclic r 1 for the last result recall that an f division algebra is indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the tensor product of two nontrivial f division algebras all division algebras of equal period and index are indecomposable while division algebras of composite period are decomposable so the problem of producing an in decomposable division algebra is only interesting when the period and index are un equal prime powers albert constructed decomposable division algebras of unequal 2 power period and index in the 1930 s but indecomposable division algebras of unequal period and index appeared for the first time only in the late 1970 s in the papers sal 79 and art 79 since then there have been several constructions including tig 87 jw 90 jac 91 svdb 92 kar 98 bru 96 and mck 08 for a p adic curve x with good reduction indecomposable algebras over k x were constructed in bmt 11 for several combinations of prime power period indices that are not multiples of p in the last section assuming k contains all p 2 th roots of unity we construct indecomposable algebras over k x of period p 2 and index p 3 for any p adic curve x with good reduction theorem 36 here in contrast with the tame case treated in bmt 11 we do not have general lifting theorems at our disposal which unfortunately constrains our methods to the above period p 2 and index p 3 however given the paucity of results addressing the p primary part of br k x we still believe this particular construction to be of interest as the methods here employed may help future investigations of related questions 2 notation and setup throughout this paper p will be a fixed prime and k will be a p adic field i e a finite extension of the field of p adic numbers qp r will be the ring of integers of k r will be a uniformizer and k r will be its residue field a finite field of characteritic p 0 k will be an algebraic closure of k and gk def gal k k will be its absolute galois group s spec k and speck will be the closed and generic points of specr x will be a smooth geometrically connected projective curve over speck we write k x for its function field and x 0 for the set of its closed points for each closed point x x 0 ox x is a discrete valuation ring and we denote by vx k x z the associated discrete valuation cyclicity and indecomposability in the brauer group of a p adic curve 3 x its residue field a p adic field k x x the completion of k x with respect to vx we will still write vx k x x z for the discrete valuation induced by the original valuation vx on k x if z is a scheme over speca and b is an a algebra we write z b for the set of specb valued points of z and z ab for the fibered product z speca specb if z is defined over specr we denote by zs def z specr s z r k and z def z specr z r k its special and generic fibers respectively for any abelian group g we respectively write g n and g n for the kernel and cokernel of the multiplication by n map g n g moreover if g is a topological abelian group we denote by g def homc g q z its pontryagin dual i e the group of all continuous morphisms g q z here q z is endowed with the discrete topology unless otherwise stated all cohomology groups will either be galois or e tale cohomology groups for any field f and n n not divisible by charf we write n for the group or galois module or e tale sheaf of all n th roots in the separable closure f sep of f we also write n f h 1 f n for the connecting map relative to the kummer sequence 1 n f sep n f sep 1 if n is clear from the context we drop it and simply write instead 3 some auxiliary facts in this section we recall some facts that will be used in the proofs of the main results we advise the reader to skip this section coming back as needed 3 1 ramification let k be a discretely valued complete field let v k z be the associated normalized valuation and f be its residue field there is a split exact sequence ser 79 xii 3 corollary to proposition 4 p 186 0 br f br k h 1 f q z 0 inf v where br k ker br k br k nr here k nr denotes the maximal unramified extension of k in case f is perfect br k br k and if charf n then br k n br k n the map v is called ramification or residue map with respect to v intuitively v can be thought of as valuation for cohomology so that the inflation map identifies br f with the subgroup of unramified classes in br k by choosing a uniformizer v k the map 7 n v inf yields a section of v for the n torsion of the above sequence and hence a non canonical isomorphism br f n h 1 f z nz br k n 7 inf n v inf 1 which will be refered to as witt decomposition of br k n by abuse of nota tion we will usually omit the inflation maps writing v instead it is fairly easy to compute the index of elements in br k n thanks to see jw 90 theorem 5 15 p 161 for a proof 4 eduardo tengan lemma 2 nakayma s index formula in the above notation let n n and br k n with witt decomposition v write for the order of the character h 1 f z nz f f for the degree field extension defined by f br f for the restriction of to f then the index of is given by ind ind f next we define ramification residue maps in more general contexts for r z and n n prime to charf denote the r th tate twist of the galois module or e tale sheaf z nz by z nz r def rn if r 1 z nz if r 0 hom r n z nz if r 1 for n n prime to charf and i 1 there are noncanonical split exact sequences see gms 03 ii 7 9 p 18 0 hi f z nz r inf hi k z nz r v hi 1 f z nz r 1 0 the map v is the ramification or residue map with finite coefficients when i 2 and r 1 it is compatible with the previously defined ramification map via the isomorphism br k n h 2 k n let z be an integral regular scheme with function field k z let d z be an irreducible weil divisor with generic point z then oz is a discrete valuation ring write vd k z z and d for the corresponding valuation and residue field respectively and let k z d be the completion of k z with respect to vd if n n is prime to char d we define the ramification or residue map d h i k z z n r hi 1 d z n r 1 with respect to d as the composition hi k z z n r hi k z d z n r h i 1 d z n r 1 res vd lemma 3 let z be an integral regular scheme of dimension at most 2 and let k z be its function field i for any n n invertible in z there is an exact sequence 0 br z n br k z n d d h 1 d q z n where d runs over all prime divisors of z ii suppose that z speca for some excellent 2 dimensional local ring a let p z be its closed point and p be the residue field of p suppose that n n is prime to char p then the following sequence is a complex br k z n d d h 1 d z n p h 0 p 1 n here d runs over all prime divisors of z and p q cor q p q where q runs over all closed points in the normalization of d in d and q is the ramification map with respect to the discrete valuation of d defined by q cyclicity and indecomposability in the brauer group of a p adic curve 5 proof the injectivity of br z br k z in i is proven in mil 80 iv 2 6 p 145 while the exactness in the middle term follows from the purity of the brauer group see ag 60 7 4 or mil 80 iv 2 18 b p 153 and also sal 08 lemma 6 6 item ii is proven in kat 86 1 p 148 in particular for a p adic curve x as in section 2 the residue field x of any closed point x x 0 is a p adic field of characteristic 0 thus we get an exact sequence 4 0 br x br k x x x x 0 h 1 x q z which allows us to interpret br x as the subgroup of br k x consisting of unramified classes with respect to all x x 0 3 2 lichtembaum s duality here we collect some facts about lichtenbaum s duality see lic 69 and also sai 86 appendix theorem 5 lichtenbaum let x be a p adic curve as in section 2 then there is a non degenerate pairing pic x br x q z inducing an isomorphism between br x and pic x this paring can explicitly be described as follows for each x x 0 write inv x br x q z for the invariant map with respect to the p adic field x x br x for the image of br x under the natural map br x br x induced by the inclusion spec x x let pic x br x and let x x 0 nxx div x be a divisor representing lichtenbaum s pairing is given by x x 0 nx inv x x the topology on pic x is defined as follows let pic 0 x be the kernel of the degree map deg pic x z and jx be the jacobian variety of x there is an exact sequence cs 86 remark 1 6 p 169 0 pic 0 x jx k br k invk q z where has finite image im 1 p z z with p period of x def gcd deg h 0 k pic x k k in particular observe that pic 0 x jx k whenever x k 6 we view jx k as a topological group with the usual p adic topology and pic 0 x as a topological subgroup with the induced topology from mat 55 we have lemma 6 mattuck let a be an abelian variety of dimension g over a p adic field k then a k contains an open subgroup of finite index isomorphic to rg 6 eduardo tengan thus the group jx k is compact and all its finite index subgroups are open thus also closed and compact since any such subgroup contains a finite index subgroup of rg which is open in particular pic 0 x is an open compact subgroup of jx k we endow pic x with the unique topology compatible with its group structure and for which pic 0 x is open in pic x with this topology all subgroups npic x of pic x n 1 2 3 are of finite index and open therefore the n torsion of br x is given by br x n lich pic x n homc pic x q z n hom pic x n 1 n z z finally we mention an important consequence of lichtembaum s duality which is implicit in the proof of theorem 5 p 132 of lic 69 see also sai 86 9 appendix p 408 and pop 88 theorem 4 5 p 172 theorem 7 ha e principle let x be a p adic curve then the following diagonal map is injective br k x x x 0 br k x x here k x x is the vx completion of k x see notation in section 2 3 3 integral models from now on we choose once and for all an integral model x of x i e a 2 dimensional regular r scheme such that f x specr is flat and proper there is an isomorphism of schemes x x the reduced scheme xs red is a 1 dimensional proper scheme over s whose irreducible components are all regular and have normal crossings i e xs only has ordinary double points as singularities the existence of such an integral model follows from the resolution of singularities of excellent 2 dimensional schemes lip 78 coupled with the embedded resolution of the special fiber see liu 02 corollary ix 2 30 p 404 if x admits a smooth integral model x over r then we say x has good reduction over r if that is the case then the special fiber xs will have a single irreducible component a proper smooth curve over s spec k and its function field k xs will be a global field of characteritic p observe that since x is geometrically integral by assumption h 0 x ox k by sta 18 lemma 0 bug then by stein s factorization sta 18 lemma 0 ay 8 the map f x specr has geometrically connected fibers and satisfies f ox or recall that a horizontal prime divisor d x is a prime divisor which is not contained in the special fiber xs for the next lemma see liu 02 proposi tion viii 3 4 p 349 and lemma viii 3 35 p 360 lemma 8 let x be a p adic curve as in section 2 and x specr be an integral model then i a horizontal divisor d x is finite and flat over specr in particular it is affine d specs for some finite extension of domains s r and the generic point d of d is the spectrum of a p adic field fracs ii there is a bijection between the set of horizontal divisors of x and x 0 namely this bijection maps a horizontal divisor d x to its generic point x d x 0 and conversely the closure d x of x x 0 inside x defines the corresponding horizontal divisor https stacks math columbia edu tag 0 bug https

fiber xs transversally at p the next lemma summarizes the facts we will need concerning the relation be tween the brauer and picard groups of the special and generic fibers of x lemma 9 in the above notation let c 1 cr be the irreducible components of the special fiber xs i artin br x br xs 0 ii assume that h 0 xs gm k and let n n not divisible by p then there are canonical isomorphisms pic x n

i r ai ci in particular if x has good reduction i e x is smooth over r then restriction pic x pic x is an isomorphism proof item i follows from the canonical isomorphism br x br xs gro 68 the ore me 3

diagram with exact rows the vertical arrows are restrictions 0 hi 1 x gm n h i x n h i x gm n 0 0 hi 1 xs gm n h i xs n h i xs gm n 0 pbc the middle vertical arrow is an isomorphism by proper base change mil 80 corol lary vi 2 7 p 224 for i 1 since the subgroup u 1 def 1 of r is n divisible by hensel s lemma from the exact sequence 1 u 1 r k 1 the leftmost vertical arrow is also an isomorphism h 0 x gm n r n k n h 0 xs gm n recall that f x specr satisfies f ox or and h 0 xs gm k by hypothesis hence the rightmost vertical arrow is an isomorphism pic x n pic xs n for i 2 by i both groups br x h 2 x gm and br xs h 2 xs gm vanish and we get the remaining isomorphisms to be shown to show iii observe that exactness at the two rightmost terms follows from ful 98 proposition 1 8 p 21 applied to the closed subscheme xs and its open complement x x r xs while exactness at the two leftmost terms follows from the intersection theory for arithmetic surfaces see liu 02 9 1 2 p 381 in particular

in charac teristic p 0 while its generic fiber is isomorphic to a kummer type sequence thus giving an explicit interpolation between the artin schreier witt and kummer theories in order to describe

schreier witt extensions to kummer ones consider the polynomial 12 c x y xp y p x y p p z x y let b be an a algebra and write b def b afp b 2 for its reduction modulo 2 to give an artin schreier witt extension of b is the same as to give a morphism f specb v 2 a fp specfp t 0 t 1 i e to give a pair b 0 b 1 b 2 so that f is defined by t 0 t 1 7 b 0 b 1 then the corresponding artin schreier witt

defines a kummer extension lifting the above artin schreier witt one namely let b 0 b 1 b 2 be any lift b 0 b 1 with pb 0 1 and pb 1 g b 0 units in b then t 0 t 1 7 b 0 b 1 defines a morphism f specb v 2 and taking the pullback spec b v 2 w 2 spec b of with respect to f we get a kummer extension b t 0 t 1 b via equations t 0 1 p 1 p b 0 1 p t 1 f t 0 p t 0 1 g b 0 b 1 or written in a more kummerish style t 0 1 p 1 b 0 p t 1 f t 0 p t 0 1 b 1 p g b 0 so that b t 0 t 1 b is built by succesively taking p th roots of certain elements 4 cyclicity for curves with good reduction in this section our goal is to show theorem 13 assume that x has good reduction and let x specr be a smooth integral model let n n with p n the ramification map with respect to the prime divisor xs induces an isomorphism br x n h 1 xs z n 10 eduardo tengan hence all elements of br x n are cyclic namely given any uniformizer k they have the form n where h 1 x z n is the unique lift of the ramifi cation h 1 xs z n of with respect to xs proof let k xs be the function field of the special fiber xs and denote by s br k x n h 1 k xs z n the corresponding ramification map first we show that s restricts to a map s br x n h 1 xs z n i e that for br x n the character s is unramified with respect to any closed point p xs from sequence 4 we get x 0 for all x x 0 thus also d 0 for all horizontal prime divisors d of x by lemma 8 ii applying lemma 3 ii with a ox p we get that p 0 i e is unramified at p as desired next given h 1 xs z n let h 1 x z n be its unique lift under the proper base change isomorphism h 1 x z n h 1 xs z n mil 80 corol lary vi 2 7 p 224 since is a uniformizer for the valuation defined by xs and is unramified we have s n showing that s br x n h 1 xs z n is surjective finally if br x n is such that s 0 then in unramified on the whole scheme x thus br x 0 by lemmas 3 i and 9 i this proves s br x n h 1 xs z n is also injective remark 14 the previous theorem can also be obtained using lichtembaum s du ality we briefly sketch the proof first recall that from class field theory of global fields of positive characteristic see mil 86 chapter i appendix a for any smooth projective curve z over a finite field k there is a non degenerate pairing of finite groups 15 h 1 z z n pic z n z n yielding an isomorphism h 1 z z n pic z n this pairing is induced by the local perfect pairings h 1 k z z z n h 1 k z z n br k z z n z n here k z z stands for the completion of the function field k z of z with respect to the valuation given by a closed point z z 0 explicitly given h 1 z z n and a divisor z nzz div z representing a given pic z n the pairing 15 maps to z nz z frobz where frobz g z is the frobenius automorphism here z denotes the residue field of z a finite field now to get the theorem we just splice together lichtenbaum s duality theorem 5 lemma 9 the isomorphism h 1 xs z n pic xs n given by 15 and the proper base change theorem br x n 5 hom pic x n z n 9 iii hom pic x n z

map s above cyclicity and indecomposability in the brauer group of a p adic curve 11 5 non cyclic division algebras in the singular case in this section we show that for a general p adic curvex with bad reduction one cannot expect br x n to be comprised solely of z n cyclic algebras in example 17 below for infinitely many primes p we exhibit a non z 3 cyclic class of period 3 in the brauer group of a certain p adic curve of genus 10 both for conceptual clarity and in order to facilitate the construction of other similar examples we work in a more general situation as described in the following setup 16 let d n be prime to p and suppose that d k choose homogenous polynomials f 1 f 2 r x y z with degfi d such that i in p 2 r the closed subschemes v f 1 and v f 2 intersect the line v z at two r points 1 2 each with multiplicity d and such that 1 6 2 here i denotes the special fiber of i ii the reductions f 1 f 2 k x y z modulo define geometrically connected smooth curves over k c 1 def projk x y z f 1 c 2 def projk x y z f 2 having normal crossings in p 2 k with at least one k rational common point p 0 c 1 c 2 iii pic c 1 d 6 0 define the integral projective r scheme x def proj r x y z f 1 f 2 z 2 d specr and the elements f 1 def f 1 z d f 2 def f 2 z d k x in its function field k x finally let u r be any unit which is not a d th power example 17 as a concrete example we may choose d 3 and a prime p 1 mod 3 so that there is a primitive third root of unity zp by hensel s lemma we will show that for almost all p the polynomials in zp x y z f 1 y 2 z yz 2 x 3 x 2 z 7 xz 2 5 z 3 f 2 x 2 z y 3 26 z 3 will satisfy the conditions of the setup the curve v f 1 p 2 q is the elliptic curve labeled 91 b 2 in the lmfdb database see http www lmfdb org let x v f 1 f 2 pz 6 p 2 zp and fi fi z 3 k x as above then in p 2 zp the subschemes v f 1 and v f 2 intersect the line v z at the r points 1 v x z and 2 v y z both with multiplicity 3 if p 6 2 3 7 13 then both reductions f i will be elliptic curves over fp sharing a common fp rational point p 0 1 3 1 c 1 c 2 moreover the resultant of f 1 x y 1 and f 2 x y 1 with respect to the variable x is 18 y 3 y 8 3 y 7 9 y 6 66 y 5 196 y 4 587 y 3 1084 y 2 3209 y 9585 which is separable over fp as long as p 6 2 3 37 97 29723 447692787897013 then by be zout s theorem each of the 32 9 roots of 18 will correspond to a different multiplicity 1 intersection point of c 1 and c 2 thus for almost all p the curves c 1 and c 2 will be regular and have normal crossings finally pic c 1 3 6 0 in fact if p 1 1 0 1 then p 1 1 pic 0 c 1 3 is a nontrivial element 12 eduardo tengan we will need the following result concerning the picard group of reducible curves such as xs see hid 12 theorem 4 1 5 chapter 4 p 296 lemma 19 let k be a field and c c 1 c 2 be the union of two proper smooth irreducible curves over k such that its components intersect transversally at r points over a finite extension of fields l k then there is a split exact sequence 0 t k pic 0 c pic 0 c 1 pic 0 c 2 0 where t is an algebraic torus that becomes isomorphic to gr 1 m over l lemma 20 assume setup 16 then a x is a regular scheme b the generic fiber x def x projk x y z f 1 f 2 z 2 d of x is a smooth projective curve over k c the special fiber xs projk x y z f 1 f 2 of x is a reduced k scheme whose irreducible components are c 1 and c 2 d the divisors c 1 and c 2 in div x are principal divisors modulo d more precisely div f 1 c 1 d 2 1 d 2 2 div f 2 c 2 d 2 2 d 2 1 in particular pic x can be generated by horizontal divisors only see defini tion before lemma 8 e there exists h k x such that div h de for some e div x the restriction h k c 1 to the function field of c 1 is well defined h is not a d th power in k c 1 p 0 is not a pole of h and h p 0 1 k p 0 here k p 0 denotes the residue field of p 0 proof to prove a we have to show that for all closed points p x the maximal ideal mp of ox p a 2 dimensional local ring can be generated by 2 elements since p necessarily lies on the special fiber xs there are two cases to consider p is a regular point of the special fiber xs in that case if t is a uniformizer of the discrete valuation ring oxs p ox p then mp t for any lift t ox p of t p is one of the nodal points in c 1 c 2 then mp f 1 f 2 which is clearly equal to f 1 f 2 since f 1 f 2 in ox p since x is regular so is its open subset x therefore b holds item c is clear to show d we work with f 1 the case for f 2 being similar first notice that as an element of the ring ox d z f 1 is a prime defining the generic point of c 1 since here f 1 stands for f 1 mod ox d z f 1 r x z y z f 1 f 2 f 1 k x z y z f 1 oc 1 d z the complement v z x r d z of the open subset d z consists of two r points 1 and 2 hence the support of div f 1 is contained in c 1 1 2 and all that is left is to compute the valuations v i f 1 of f 1 with respect to the points i actually it suffices to show that v 1 f 1 d 2 then by symmetry v 2 f 2 d 2 and from f 1 f 2 we will automatically get v 2 f 1 d 2 cyclicity and indecomposability in the brauer group of a p adic curve 13 to show v 1 f 1 d 2 it is enough to work over the 2 dimensional local ring ox 1 without loss of generality say that 1 d y and write x x y z z y and i fi y d r x z let specr x z p 2 r be the prime corresponding to the generic point of 1 so that 1 and ox 1 r x z 1 2 z 2 d since 1 6 2 by hypothesis 1 v f 2 p 2 k and thus 2 is a unit in ox 1 therefore 1 2 z 2 d f 1 1 z d 2 z d in ox 1 showing that v 1 f 1 d v 1 z finally to show that v 1 z d we have to compute the length of the ox module ox z r x z 1 2 z 2 d z r x z 1 z since 2 o x 1 2 in r x z and thus 2 r x z as well but the length of the last module is exactly the intersection multiplicity of v z and v f 1 in p 2 r at 1 which is d by hypothesis finally to show e let l 1 pic c 1 d be a nontrivial element whose existence is guaranteed by setup 16 iii since xs is geometrically connected h 0 xs oxs k and by lemmas 9 ii and 19 the natural map pic x d pic xs d pic 0 c 1 d pic 0 c 2 d is surjective hence there is l pic x d restricting to l 1 we may write l ox e for some divisor e div x whose support does not contain c 1 c 2 or any divisor going through any of the at most d 2 intersection points of c 1 and c 2 in fact pic x is generated by horizontal divisors moreover as in the proof of the lemma in sal 98 we may modify e by a principal divisor using the fact that there is an affine open set speca of x containing all these intersection points and that the semi localization of a with respect to the corresponding maximal ideals is a ufd by auslander buchsbaum s theorem and mat 89 exercise 20 5 p 169 since l ox e has order d in pic x there exists h k x such that div h de and by the choice of e the restriction h k c 1 is well defined and p 0 is neither a zero nor a pole of h thus multiplying h by a unit in r we may further assume that h p 0 1 now all that is left is to show that h is not a d th power in k c 1 write e 1 div c 1 for the restriction of e to c 1 then l 1 oc 1 e 1 in pic c 1 and div h de 1 hence if h gd with g k c 1 we would have div g e 1 which contradicts the fact that l 1 oc 1 e 1 is not trivial in pic c 1 this finishes the proof of item e now we are ready to show claim 21 assume setup 16 and let h be as in the previous lemma choose a primitive root of unity d d and define the period d sum of symbol algebras def f 1 h d f 2 u d br k x d then br x d if m and n are respectively the orders of h in k c 1 d and u in k d then mn ind in particular when d is prime ind d hence is not z d cyclic 14 eduardo tengan proof let p x 0 be an arbitrary closed point of the generic fiber of x then p is the generic point of a unique horizontal divisor on x lemma 8 ii write vp k x z and p br k x d h 1 p q z d for the corre sponding discrete valuation and ramification maps by sequence 4 to prove that br x d we have to show that p 0 but this is clear since all vp f 1 vp f 2 vp h vp u 0 are multiples of d by itens d and e of the previous lemma next let k x be the completion ofk x k x with respect to the valuation defined by the prime divisor c 1 observe that f 1 is a uniformizer of k x and that its residue field is k c 1 the function field of c 1 to show that mn ind it is enough to show that the index of the restriction k x is a multiple of mn we just have to apply nakayma s index formula lemma 2 denoting by a bar images in k c 1 since the order of the f 1 unramified kummer character given by d h h 1 k c 1 d h 1 k x d is m ind k x m ind f 2 u d k c 1 h 1 d since k c 1 h 1 d is a global field of characteristic p by class field theory the index of f 2 u d k c 1 h 1 d is the least common multiple of its local invariants hence it suffices to show that one of these invariants equals n since h p 0 1 by construction p 0 splits completely in the kummer extension k c 1 h 1 d hence the local invariant of f 2 u d k c 1 h 1 d with respect to any point lying over p 0 is the same as invp 0 f 2 u d but the latter is equal to the order n of u in k d since f 2 is a uniformizer of p 0 c 1 recall that c 1 and c 2 have normal crossings by assumption and we are done 6 tate curves in this section we use lichtenbaum s duality in order to study the brauer group of elliptic curves with split multiplicative reduction i e tate curves the nice fact about tate curves is that they enjoy a p adic uniformization which will allow us to obtain cyclicity results even for the p primary case let q k with q 1 recall that the tate elliptic curve eq is the elliptic curve defined by the affine equation y 2 xy x 3 a 4 q x a 6 q where sr q n 1 nrqn 1 qn a 4 q 5 s 3 q a 6 q 5 s 3 q 7 s 5 q 12 for the next result see sil 94 theorems v 3 1 on p 423 v 5 3 on p 442 theorem 22 tate let q k with q 1 and eq be the tate elliptic curve as defined above i there is an exact sequence of gk modules 0 z k eq k 0 n 7 qn cyclicity and indecomposability in the brauer group of a p adic curve 15 with the usual trivial gk action on z and galois actions on k and eq k in particular for every algebraic extension l k induces an isomorphism eq l l qz since h 1 gl z homc gl z 0 ii let e be an elliptic curve over k with split multiplicative reduction then e is k isomorphic to eq for some q k q 1 the main technical result in this section is given by the following lemma 23 let q k with q 1 and eq be the corresponding tate elliptic curve for any finite field extension l k let l l gabl be the local reci procity map see ns 13 chapter v p 317 and ser 79 chapter xiii p 188 and write h 1 q gl q z for the kernel of q h 1 gl q z homc g ab l q z q z 7 l q then there is an isomorphism q br eq l h 1 q gl q z q z sitting in a commutative diagram br eq l h 1 q gl q z q z br eq h 1 q gk q z q z q res q res l k proof first observe that the continuous map l l gabl induces an isomor phism h 1 gl q z homc g ab l q z l homc l q z in fact l is injective since l has dense image to show that l is surjective let f homc l q z and let l be a uniformizer of the ring of integers rl of l so that l zl ul where ul denotes the group of units of rl since q z has discrete topology ker f must be open in l i e ker f u i l def 1 l i for some i 1 since l zl ul and f l and ul u i l have finite orders im f is finite and thus ker f has finite index in l therefore ker f nm l m is a norm group for some finite abelian extension m l by the existence theorem ser 79 xiv 6 theorem 1 p 218 therefore f will be the image under l of the composition gabl gal m l l nm l m l ker f q z 1 m l f where m l denotes the isomorphism induced on finite quotients by l next by theorem 22 i there is an exact sequence of topological groups 0 z l eq l 0 which together with the isomorphism l h 1 gl q z homc l q z gives rise to an exact sequence 0 homc eq l q z h 1 gl q z q homc z q z q z 16 eduardo tengan hence eq l ker q h 1 q gl q z therefore by lichtembaum s duality theorem 5 we get isomorphisms br eq l 5 pic eq l eq l z h 1 q gl q z q z here we have used the identifications eq l pic 0 eq k l pic eq k l pic 0 eq k l z p 7 p ol 7 deg ol deg where p pic eq k l denotes the class of the degree 1 divisor given by p eq l and ol eq l is the identity element of the elliptic curve finally to prove that the diagram in the statement of the lemma commutes write f eq k l eq for the natural map let n l k and 1 n l l be the k imersions of l into its separable closure l k then f pic eq k l pic eq is given on closed points p eq l by f p 1 i n i p pic eq k k gk pic eq where pic eq k k gk pic eq follows from the hochschild serre spectral se quence and the fact that eq has a k rational point so that br k br eq is injective see for example lic 69 2 p 122 hence f ol n ok and there is a commutative diagram pic eq k l pic 0 eq k l z eq l z l qz z pic eq pic 0 eq z eq k z k qz z f f f nl k n where the rightmost vertical arrow is induced by the norm on the first component and by multiplication by n l k on the second combining the above diagram with the next one expressing one of the functorial properties of the local reciprocity map l gabl k gabk nl k l k taking pontryagin duals and applying lichtenbaum s duality finishes the proof the following lemma is well known but we include its short proof for the con venience of the reader lemma 24 let m n be such that gcd m k 1 where k denotes the finite group of all roots of unity in k then the character group h 1 gk q z is m divisible proof taking gk invariants of 0 1 mz z q z m q z 0 we obtain an exact sequence h 1 gk q z m h 1 gk q z h 2 gk 1 mz z 0 cyclicity and indecomposability in the brauer group of a p adic curve 17 whose last term vanishes by local duality nsw 00 theorem 7 2 6 p 327 h 2 gk 1 m z z h 0 gk m m k 0 now we can show the main result in this section theorem 25 let m n and eq be a tate elliptic curve over k suppose that p m is allowed i either m is prime or ii gcd m k 1 then all elements of br eq m are z m cyclic proof by looking at primary parts it suffices to consider the case when m r is a power of some prime let br eq m be an element of order m and q a h 1 q gk q z q z then either or a has order m r if h 1 q gk q z has order m then it corresponds to a surjective morphism gk z mz hence to a degreem cyclic extension l k by the commutative diagram in lemma 23 l 0 i e is z m cyclic if has order s with s r then there exists a character h 1 gk q z of order m r such that r s this is clear in case i while in case ii it follows from the previous lemma then defines a degree r cyclic extension l k such that l 0 again by the diagram in lemma 23 noting that qp p 1 we obtain the following interesting corollary 26 let eq be a tate elliptic curve over qp and r n then all classes in br eq p r are z pr cyclic 7 indecomposable algebras in this section we assume once again that x is the generic fiber of a smooth projective r curve x our goal is to show that there are indecomposable algebras in the function field k x of x with period p 2 and index p 3 assuming enough roots of unity theorem 36 the construction basically follows the strategy in bmt 11 but we now have to struggle with the fact that for the p primary case we do not have at our disposal general lifting theorems as was the case in the prime to p situation treated in that paper that unfortunately restricts our construction to the above period p 2 and index p 3 as in bmt 11 we rely on the following well known criterion for indecomposability lemma 27 let n pr and br k x n be such that ind p 1 p ind then is indecomposable we begin with a lemma 28 let c be a smooth projective curve over the finite field k fq for all sufficiently large integers m 0 there exist distinct closed points p p 1 p 2 c all of degree m such that the divisors p 1 p and p 2 p are principal proof let g be the genus of c and for each m n 0 denote by s m the set of all closed points p c of degree p k m by hkt 08 theorem 9 25 p 346 s m q m m 2 7 g qm m for all m 2 lim m s m qm m 1 18 eduardo tengan hence s m asympotically grows as qm m and ifm is large enough then s m 2 pic 0 c fix such an m and pick an arbitrary point q s m then in the set p q div 0 c p s m there will be three distinct divisors p q p 1 q p 2 q having the same image in pic 0 c hence their differences p 1 p and p 2 p will have trivial image in pic 0 c i e they will be principal divisors let x specr be a smooth projective curve as above fix m n such that m is not divisible by p m 2 g 2 where g is the genus of xs m 0 satisfies the conditions of the lemma for c xs so that there are three distinct degree m points p p 1 p 2 xs such that div f i pi p div xs i 1 2 for some elements f i k xs in the function field of xs by lemma 8 iii there is a horizontal divisord on x intersecting the special fiber xs transversally at p xs and since m 2 g 2 hh 10 proposition 4 1 p 71 shows that the map h 0 x ox d h 0 xs oxs p is surjective hence we may choose fi h 0 x ox d k x lifting f i then all components of div fi are horizontal since f i 6 0 and d is the only pole of fi hence div fi di d div x i 1 2 where di is a horizontal divisor on x restricting transversally to pi xs for i 1 2 moreover since oxs pi f i k is a separable degree m field extension ox pi fi r is a finite unramified extension of degree m hence ox pi fi is a complete p adic ring with uniformizer now set f f 1 f 2 so that it restricts to f f 1 f 2 and div f d 1 d 2 2 d div x div f p 1 p 2 2 p div xs from now on suppose that p 6 2 and p 2 k we keep the notation of subsection 3 4 writing 2 p 2 for a primitive p 2 th root of unity 2 2 1 and so on observe that 2 is a uniformizer of qp 2 a subfield of k hence 2 in r consider the degree p 2 artin schreier witt extension of k xs given by xp x f 29 yp y c xp x f 1 30 where c x y z x y is the polynomial 12 defined in subsection 3 4 since p 6 2 it is easy to check that both p 1 and p 2 split completely in k xs x k xs and each place above p 1 or p 2 is totally ramified in k xs x y k xs x while p is totally ramified in k xs x y k xs in particular this shows that the latter extension indeed has degree p 2 now we lift k xs x y k xs to the kummer extension of k x defined by equations x 1 p 1 p f 31 1 p y f x p x 1 g f 1 f 32 cyclicity and indecomposability in the brauer group of a p adic curve 19 where f g r x are the p truncated exponentials 11 let h 1 k x z p 2 be a kummer character of order p 2 associated to this extension andw respectively y be the normalization of x in the kummer extension of k x defined by 31 respectively 31 and 32 so that the composition y w x defines a degree p 2 cyclic cover of x observe that the function fields of w and y are given by k w k x x and k y k x x y respectively lemma 33 in the above notation for i 1 2 let ai and bi be the normalizations of ox pi in k w and k y respectively then i ai and bi are regular semilocal rings hence ufds each with exactly p max imal ideals ii the prime divisor di of x splits completely into p disjoint horizontal divisors d i 1 d ip in specai i e di x specai d i 1 d ip with each d ij di corresponding bijectively to the maximal ideals of ai in particular f is a local parameter for each d ij iii each d ij is totally ramified in specbi proof we will prove the lemma for i 1 observe that p 1 is the closed point of d 1 f 2 o x p 1 since f 2 p 1 6 0 both f 1 and f f 1 f 2 are local parameters for d 1 in specox p 1 and f f 1 is the maximal ideal of the 2 dimensional regular local ring ox p 1 expanding 31 since p 1 p in r ox p 1 we get the following monic equation for x with coefficients in ox p 1 34 xp p xp 1 p p 1 2 xp 2 p p 1 x f 0 whose reduction modulo is 29 sinceox p 1 x ox p 1 is an integral extension if we show thatox p 1 x is a regular semilocal ring then ox p 1 x will be a ufd by auslander buchsbaum s theorem and mat 89 exercise 20 5 p 169 hence normal showing also that a 1 ox p 1 x since 34 reduces to xp x 0 modulo the maximal ideal f of ox p 1 the fiber of f under specox p 1 x specox p 1 is given by specox p 1 x f spec p 1 x xp x a disjoint union of p copies of spec p 1 this shows that ox p 1 x is semilocal with p maximal ideals x a f for a 0 1 p 1 equation 34 shows that x a f x a in the localization ox p 1 x x a f therefore ox p 1 x is regular since d 1 x speca 1 specox p 1 x f in order to show ii we have to show that ox p 1 x f is isomorphic to a product of p copies of ox p 1 but ox p 1 f is a complete p adic ring with uniformizer and 34 reduces to the separable equation xp x 0 modulo f therefore the result follows by hensel s lemma expanding 32 and multiplying by 1 x f yp we get f x p 1 x g f p f 1 x 1 y p pf p 1 f x p 1 1 y p 1 pf f x 1 y f 0 35 20 eduardo tengan the last equation implies that a 1 1 y a 1 is an integral extension in fact by ss 01 5 15 p 236 one has that f t p t 1 g t 1 p 1 p mod p moreover 1 x is a unit in the semilocal ring a 1 ox p 1 x since belongs to the maximal ideal f of ox p 1 therefore the coefficient of 1 y p belongs to a 1 equation 35 also shows that the fiber under speca 1 1 y speca 1 of any maximal ideal x a f with a 0 1 p 1 is spec p 1 1 y 1 y p i e consists of a single maximal ideal x a f 1 y hence a 1 1 y is semilocal with p maximal ideals next we show that the 2 dimensional semilocal ring a 1 1 y is regular hence normal thus proving that b 1 a 1 1 y in the localization a 1 x a f we have x a f f by 34 hence in a 1 1 y x a f 1 y we have x a f 1 y 1 y by 35 showing that a 1 1 y is regular finally if d 1 i speca 1 is the prime divisor corresponding to the maximal ideal x a f of a 1 in ii since f is a local parameter ford 1 i speca 1 x a f f from 35 we get d 1 i speca 1 specb 1 spec a 1 x a f 1 y f 1 y p hence the pre image of d 1 i in specb 1 is the divisor locally given by 1 y with multiplicity p i e d 1 i is totally ramified in specb 1 now we can show theorem 36 suppose p 6 2 and let x be the generic fiber of a smooth projective geometrically connected r curve x assume p 2 k and let h 1 k x z p 2 be the degree p 2 character constructed above corresponding to the field extension k y k x let h f 1 f 2 and h 1 k z p 2 be the unramified character of order p 2 define def p 2 h p 2 br k x p 2 then is the class of an indecomposable algebra with ind p 3 the proof of the theorem will immediately follow from lemma 27 once we show the next two lemmas lemma 37 p 3 ind and p 2 ind p proof let k x be the completion of k x with respect to the discrete valuation defined by the special fiber xs notice that k x has uniformizer and residue field k xs the function field of xs a global field of characteristic p our goal is to show that the restriction of to k x has index p 3 since the compositum of k x and k x splits and both define unramified extensions of k x we may apply lemma 2 in order to compute ind k x ind h k xs p 2 ind h k xs let h k xs br k xs we must show that ind k xs p and for that we need to compute the local invariants of k xs since defines an un ramified cover of xs and div h p 1 p 2 div xs withm pi k prime cyclicity and indecomposability in the brauer group of a p adic curve 21 to p where h f 1 f 2 has nontrivial invariants 1 p 2 q z only at p 1 and p 2 on the other hand by construction k xs k xs is the artin schreier witt extension given by equations 29 and 30 which defines local extensions of degree p at the completions of k xs at p 1 and p 2 therefore k xs will have local invariants 1 p q z at those places and thus its index is p as desired a similar argument shows that ind p k x p 2 for the next and final lemma we make some preliminary remarks first for any x x 0 denote by rx the ring of integers of the p adic field x then by the valuative criterion of properness the inclusion x spec x x x extends uniquely to an rx valued point specrx x the normalization of the horizontal divisor x x see lemma 8 ii second let m k x be a field extension let z be the p adic curve obtained by normalizing x in m and z x be the natural map induced by the inclusion of function fields k x m k z by corollary 7 to show that m splits some br k x we can proceed locally showing that for every closed point z z 0 with image x x 0 the completion k z z of k z at z splits k x x third let x x 0 and z z 0 be a closed point lying over x with respect to the map z x let dx def x x be horizontal divisor associated to x see lemma 8 ii write px xs for the closed point of dx let a ox px and p speca be the height 1 prime ideal which is the generic point of dx speca p let c k z be the normalization of a in k z we claim that oz z cq for some height 1 prime ideal q specc which is contained in a single maximal ideal of c in fact since oz z is a localization of the normalization of ox x in k z we have the following inclusions of rings and corresponding maps of spectra c oz z a ox x ap q specc specoz z p speca specox x let q specc be the image of the closed point of specoz z so that q lies over p since p has height 1 and a c is integral with a normal by the going up and going down theorems q also has height 1 thus cq is a discrete valuation ring being a local noetherian normal domain of dimcq 1 then the inclusion c oz z induces a local injective map cq oz z which must be an equality since discrete valuation rings are maximal with respect to domination of valuation rings mat 89 exercise 10 5 p 77 finally we have to check that q is contained in a single maximal ideal of c i e that c q is a local domain consider the inclusion a p c q a finite extension of domains since dx speca p is a horizontal divisor speca p is finite and flat over specr lemma 8 i hence specc q specr is finite with r henselian now the result follows from mil 80 theorem i 4 2 b p 32 lemma 38 let l k be the unramified extension of degree p let m l y be the compositum of l and k y then m k x p 3 and m splits thus ind is at most p 3 similarly ind p is at most p 2 proof first observe that l and k y are linearly disjoint over k x for instance by lemma 33 the maximal ideals of specb 1 lying over p 1 define trivial residue field extensions in specb 1 specox p 1 hence m l y k x is a degree 22 eduardo tengan p 3 extension and since it visibly splits we must show that it splits the remaining part h let z be the normalization of x in m the inclusions m k y k x define maps of p adic curves z y x fix a closed point z z 0 and let y y 0 and x x 0 be its images our goal is to show that k z z splits k x x let px xs be the closed point of the horizontal divisor x there are a few cases to consider i px 6 p 1 p 2 then h is a unit in ox px thus also in ox x since is also unramified with respect to x k x x br x but k x x h x is already trivial in br x since is also unramified and h o x px implies that the image of h in rx the valuation ring of x a normalization of a quotient of ox px is also a unit ii px p 1 or the analogous case px p 2 write b k y and c m for the normalizations of a ox p 1 in k y and m k z respectively by lemma 33 b is a 2 dimensional regular semilocal ring with p maximal ideals m 1 mp moreover since both f and h are local parameters of d 1 in speca by the same lemma we may write h ut p 1 t p p where u b and ti b are prime elements defining the irreducible components of d 1 x specb with ti mi and ti mj for i 6 j by the above remarks oy y bq for some height 1 prime ideal q specb say contained in m 1 and not in any other mi with i 6 1 in bm 1 h u t p 1 with u b m 1 therefore we may write m h m p m t 1 u m u m since l has order p and thus p m 0 but u b m 1 u o y y hence the same argument of i shows that u k y y u y 0 therefore k z z u k z z 0 as well references ag 60 maurice auslander and oscar goldman the brauer group of a commutative ring trans amer math soc 97 367 409 1960 art 79 s a amitsur l h rowen and j
