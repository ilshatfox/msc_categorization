describe the leavitt path algebra of the cayley graph cn corresponding to the cyclic group z nz using a kirchberg phillips type realization result we show that there are exactly four isomorphism classes of such leavitt path algebras arising as the algebras cor responding to the graphs ci 3 i 6 for each finite group h the cayley graph ch of h is a directed graph which en codes information about the relationships between elements of h and a set of gener ators of h in the particular case where hn z nz and n 3 the cayley graph chn which we denote simply by cn consists of n vertices v 1 v

cn is the graph with n vertices and 2 n edges where each vertex emits two edges one to both of its neighboring vertices we denote by acn the incidence matrix of cn which for n 3 is easily seen to be

focus of sustained investigation since 2004 we give here a basic description of lk e for additional information see e g aap 1 or aas definition of leavitt path algebra letk be a field and let e e 0 e 1 r s be a directed graph with vertex set e 0 and edge set e 1 the leavitt path k algebra lk e of e with coefficients in k is the k algebra generated by a set v v e 0 together with a set of variables e e e e 1 which satisfy the following relations v vw v wv for all v w e 0 e 1 s e e er e e for all e e 1 e 2 r e e e s e e for all e e 1 ck 1 e e e e r e for all e e e 1 ck 2 v e e 1 s e v ee for every v e 0 for which 0 s 1 v an alternate description of lk e may be given as follows for any graph e let e denote the double graph of e gotten by adding to e an edge e for each edge e e 1 then lk e is the usual path algebra ke modulo the ideal generated by the relations ck 1 and ck 2 it is easy to show that lk e is unital if and only if e 0 is finite this is of course the case when e cn let e be a directed graph with vertices v 1 v 2 vn and adjacency matrix ae ai j we let fn denote the free abelian monoid on the generators v 1 v 2 vn so fn n i 1 z as monoids we denote the identity element of this monoid by z we let rn e denote the submonoid of fn generated by the relations vi n j 1 ai jvj for each non sink vi the graph monoid me of e is defined as the quotient monoid me fn rn e the elements of me are typically denoted using brackets leavitt path algebras of cayley graphs arising from cyclic groups 3 as a representative example we explicitly describe the graph monoid mc 3 associated to the cayley graph c 3 this is the free abelian monoid on the generators v 1 v 2 v 3 modulo the submonoid generated by the relations v 1 v 2 v 3 v 2 v 1 v 3 and v 3 v 1 v 2 note that for instance v 1 v 1 v 2 v 3 v 1 v 2 v 1 v 3 v 3 v 2 v 1 so that v 1 v 1 v 1 v 2 v 3 in mc 3 let x denote the element v 1 v 2 v 3 of mc 3 then a similar computation yields that v 2 v 2 x and v 3 v 3 x in mc 3 moreover v 1 v 1 v 1 v 2 v 3 x and in a similar fashion we also have 2 v 2 2 v 3 x in mc 3 thus we see that mc 3 z v 1 v 2 v 3 v 1 v 2 v 3 we have not justified why these five elements are distinct in mc 3 but this can be done easily see e g as page 171 more generally for any n 1 the monoidmcn is generated by v 1 v 2 vn subject to the relations vi vi 1 vi 1 for all 1 i n where subscripts are interpreted mod n this description also covers the cases n 1 and n 2 we present now the background information required to achieve our main result theorem 8 which yields a description of the leavitt path algebras corresponding to the cayley graphs cn n 1 the cornerstone of the result is a utilization of the algebraic kirchberg phillips theorem to motivate and explain how this theorem is used in the following three paragraphs we make a streamlined visit to three elegant fundamental results in the theory of leavitt path algebras and purely infinite simple algebras for a unital k algebra a the set of isomorphism classes of finitely generated projective left a modules is denoted by v a we denote the elements of v a using brackets for example a v a represents the isomorphism class of the left regular module aa v a is a monoid with operation and zero element 0 the monoid v a is conical this means that the sum of any two nonzero elements of v a is nonzero or rephrased that v a v a 0 is a semigroup under a striking property of leavitt path algebras was established in amp theorem 3 5 to wit v lk e me as monoids moreover lk e v e 0 v under this isomorphism a unital k algebra a is called purely infinite simple in case a is not a division ring and a has the property that for every nonzero element x of a there exists b c a for which bxc 1 a it is shown in agp corollary 2 2 that if a is a unital purely infinite simple k algebra then the semigroup v a is in fact a group and moreover that v a k 0 a the grothendieck group of a indeed for unital leavitt path algebras the converse is true as well if v lk e is a group then lk e is purely infinite simple this converse is not true for general k algebras summarizing when lk e is unital purely infinite simple we have the following isomorphism of groups k 0 lk e v lk e m e 4 gene abrams and benjamin schoonmaker the finite graphs e for which the leavitt path algebra lk e is purely infinite simple have been explicitly described in aap 2 to wit lk e is purely infinite simple e is cofinal sink free and satisfies condition l somewhat more fully these are the graphs e for which every vertex in e connects via some directed path to every cycle of e every cycle in e has an exit i e in each cycle of e there is a vertex which emits at least two edges and e contains at least one cycle the structure of the field k plays no role in determining the purely infinite simplicity of lk e we now have the necessary background information in hand which allows us to present the powerful tool which will yield our main result the proof of the following theorem utilizes deep results and ideas in the theory of symbolic dynamics the letters k and p in its name derive from e kirchberg and n c phillips who independently in 2000 proved an analogous result for graph c algebras the algebraic kp theorem alps corollary 2 7 suppose e and f are finite graphs for which the leavitt path algebras lk e and lk f are purely in finite simple suppose that there is an isomorphism k 0 lk e k 0 lk f for which lk e lk f and suppose also that the two integers det i e 0 a t e and det i f 0 a t f have the same sign i e are either both nonnegative or both nonpositive then lk e lk f as k algebras we note that as of fall 2013 it is not known whether the hypothesis regarding the germane determinants can be eliminated from the statement of the algebraic kp theorem on the other hand is the case that the determinant hypothesis can be eliminated in the analogous graph c algebra result established by kirchberg and phillips thus alps corollary 2 7 is sometimes called the restricted algebraic kirchberg phillips theorem our goal for the remainder of this short note is to analyze the data required to invoke the algebraic kp theorem in the context of the collection of algebras lk cn n n we start by noting that displays and immediately give proposition 1 for each n 1 the k algebra lk cn is unital purely infinite simple in particular m cn mcn z is a group referring to the explicit description of mc 3 given above it is easy to see that m c 3 v 1 v 2 v 3 v 1 v 2 v 3 z 2 z z 2 z using the previous computations we see that x v 1 v 2 v 3 is the identity element of the group m c 3 indeed we will see below that for any n n the element n i 1 vi is the identity element in m cn however for an arbitrary graph e the analogous element v e 0 v need not be the identity of m e let e be a finite directed graph for which e 0 n and let ae denote the usual incidence matrix of e let be denote the matrix in a t e we view be both as a matrix and as a linear transformation be z n zn via left multiplication viewing elements of zn as column vectors in the situation where lk e is leavitt path algebras of cayley graphs arising from cyclic groups 5 purely infinite simple so that in particular m e is a group necessarily isomorphic to k 0 lk e we have that k 0 lk e m e z n im be coker be see aalp section 3 for a complete discussion under this isomorphism we have vi 7 bi im be where bi is the element of z n which is 1 in the ith coordinate and 0 elsewhere for any n nmatrix t mn z we may view t as a linear transformation from z n to zn in the usual way then the finitely generated abelian group zn im t may be described by analyzing the smith normal form of t see e g s specifically if the smith normal form of t is the diagonal matrix diag 1 2 n then z n im t z 1 z z 2 z z nz where z 1 z is interpreted as the trivial group 0 most computer software packages e g mathematica and scientific notebook contain a built in smith normal form function using this method where we let t be the matrix be in a t e we present here a description of the groups m c 1 through m c 12 of course the description of some of these groups can be achieved using a more straightforward approach than the utilization of smith normal form as was done above for the group m c 3 m c 1 0 m c 2 z 3 z m c 3 z 2 z z 2 z m c 4 z 3 z m c 5 0 m c 6 z z m c 7 0 m c 8 z 3 z m c 9 z 2 z z 2 z m c 10 z 3 z m c 11 0 m c 12 z z the displayed isomorphisms suggest a pattern first noticed by a egri nagy and shared with the first author in a private communication although for an arbitrary graph e there is no appropriate notion of the inverse of an element in the semigroup m e since this need not be a group we use the standard minus sign notation to denote inverses in m e whenever this semigroup is actually a group in particular it is appropriate to consider an element of the form x in m cn for any x m cn lemma 2 for each vi in the group m cn we have vi vi 3 conse quently vi vi 6 for all 1 i n in m cn proof in m cn we have vi 1 vi vi 2 and vi 2 vi 1 vi 3 substituting yields vi 1 vi vi 1 vi 3 since m cn is a group we can cancel vi 1 and the result follows immediately proposition 3 for n m 1 if n m mod 6 then m cn m cm proof by the previously displayed isomorphisms it suffices to show that if n 6 and n nmod 6 with 6 n 11 then m cn m cn we choose n 6 in order to avoid some notational issues involving the interpretation of integers mod 6 for any graph e having e 0 t we denote by t the canonical homomorphism of monoids ft ft rt e we note that since none of the generating relations which produce rt e are of the form n i 1 mivi 0 for mi n t restricts to a homomorphism t f t ft rt e define the semigroup homomorphism f n f n by setting vi vimod 6 for each generator vi 1 i n of f n and extending linearly let f n m cn be the composition n so that in particular vi vimod 6 for 1 i n to show that factors to a homomorphism from m cn to m cn we need only show that takes each of the relations vi vi 1 vi 1 1 i n interpreted modn in rn e to a relation valid in m cn in other words it suffices to show that 6 gene abrams and benjamin schoonmaker vi vi 1 vi 1 in m cn we consider five cases the point here is that we must understand the given relations with two things in mind the interpretation of the integers kmod 6 which arise in the definition of as integers between 1 and 6 inclusive as well as the interpretation of the subscripts in the expressions in m cn as integers modn case 1 a 1 i 1 and i 1 n and i 1 1 2 3 or 4 mod 6 then vi vimod 6 vi 1 mod 6 vi 1 mod 6 vi 1 vi 1 case 1 b 1 i 1 and i 1 n and i 1 5 mod 6 so i 6 mod 6 and i 1 1 mod 6 then using lemma 2 we have vi vimod 6 v 6 v 5 v 7 v 5 v 1 vi 1 mod 6 vi 1 mod 6 vi 1 vi 1 case 1 c 1 i 1 and i 1 n and i 1 6 mod 6 so i 1 mod 6 and i 1 2 mod 6 then using lemma 2 we have vi vimod 6 v 1 v 7 v 6 v 8 v 6 v 2 vi 1 mod 6 vi 1 mod 6 vi 1 vi 1 case 2 i 1 so vi 1 vn in fn by definition then using that nmod 6 nmod 6 and lemma 2 we get v 1 v 1 vn v 2 vnmod 6 v 2 vnmod 6 v 2 vi 1 mod 6 vi 1 mod 6 vi 1 vi 1 case 3 i n so vi 1 v 1 in fn by definition then using that nmod 6 nmod 6 and lemma 2 we get vn vnmod 6 vnmod 6 vn vn 1 v 1 vn 1 mod 6 v 1 vn 1 mod 6 v 1 vi 1 mod 6 vi 1 mod 6 vi 1 vi 1 thus preserves the relations which generate rn e and so extends to a group homomorphism m cn m cn in a completely analogous manner for n nmod 6 with 6 n 11 there exists a group homomorphism m cn m cn for which vi vimod 6 it is then clear that and are inverses thus establishing the result for n m 6 the observation made prior to the proposition shows that the cases n 1 2 3 4 5 satisfy the statement as well as a consequence of proposition 3 and using the previously displayed compu tations we see that there are up to isomorphism only four groups represented by the collection m cn n n as follows corollary 4 the following is a complete description of the isomorphism classes of the groups m cn for n n 1 m cn 0 in case n 1 mod 6 or n 5 mod 6 2 m cn z 3 z in case n 2 mod 6 or n 4 mod 6 3 m cn z 2 z z 2 z in case n 3 mod 6 4 m cn z z in case n 6 mod 6 leavitt path algebras of cayley graphs arising from cyclic groups 7 with the first piece of the analysis now in place we turn our attention to describing the element lk cn of the group k 0 lk cn by this amounts to describing the element n i 1 vi in the group m cn lemma 5 for each n n n i 1 vi is the identity element of the group m cn proof let x denote the element n i 1 vi ofm cn using the defining relations rn cn we have x n i 1 vi n i 1 vi 1 vi 1 n i 1 vi 1 n i 1 vi 1 x x as we interpret the indices of the generating elements modulo n in m cn but the equation x x x in a group yields immediately that x is the identity element suppose that m n are integers for which m cn m cm see corollary 4 then trivially such an isomorphismmust send the element n i 1 vi ofm cn to the element m i 1 vi of m cm as lemma 5 shows that each of these expressions is the identity element in the respective group the final piece of the hypotheses in the algebraic kp theorem involves deter minants of appropriate matrices which we analyze in the next result proposition 6 for each n n det in a t cn 0 proof an n n matrix b bi j is circulant in case we have bi 1 j 1 bi j for 1 i n 1 1 j n 1 b 1 j 1 bn j for j 1 n and bi 1 1 bi n for i 1 n less formally b is circulant in case each subsequent row of b is obtained from the previous row by moving each entry of the previous row one place to the right and moving the last entry of the previous row to the first position of the subsequent row the last row gets moved to the first row in this way as well if b is circulant then there is a formula derived from an analysis of the eigenvectors of b which expresses det b as the following product det b n 1 j 0 b 1 b 2 j b 3 2 j bn n 1 j where b 1 b 2 b 3 bn is the first row of b and j e 2 ij n is an nth root of unity in c see e g ks for a description of some of the many places in which circulant matrices arise in the case of the cayley graph cn for n 3 the matrix b in a t cn has b 1 1 b 2 bn 1 and bi 0 for i 3 4 n 1 using that e i cos i sin together with the displayed equation we get det in a t cn n 1 j 0 1 j n 1 j n 1 j 0 1 e 2 ij n e 2 ij n 1 n n 1 j 0 1 cos 2 j n i sin 2 j n cos 2 j n 1 n i sin 2 j n 1 n n 1 j 0 1 2 cos 2 n j 8 gene abrams and benjamin schoonmaker with the final equality coming as a direct result of the basic trigonometry facts that for any integer j cos 2 j n 1 n cos 2 j n and sin 2 j n 1 n sin 2 j n when j 0 we have 1 2 cos 2 n j 1 2 cos 0 1 0 in case n is even when j n 2 we have 1 2 cos 2 n j 1 2 cos 3 0 furthermore since 1 2 cos 2 n j 1 2 cos 2 n n j we see that 1 2 cos 2 n j 1 2 cos 2 n n j 0 this yields the result we note as a consequence of the previous analysis that det in a t cn 0 precisely when one of the factors 1 2 cos 2 n j 0 j n 1 equals 0 this can easily be shown to happen precisely when n is a multiple of 6 this information is consistent with the observation that the only values of n for which the group m cn is infinite are multiples of 6 of the four groups which arise up to isomorphism as a group of the form m cn for n 1 we see that two are cyclic 0 and z 3 z purely infinite simple unital leavitt path algebras lk e whose corresponding k 0 groups are cyclic and for which det i e 0 a t e 0 are relatively well understood and arise from the classical leavitt algebras lk 1 n as follows for any integer n 2 lk 1 n is the free associative k algebra in 2 n generators x 1 x 2 xn y 1 y 2 yn subject to the relations yixj i j 1 k and n i 1 xiyi 1 k these algebras were first defined and investigated in l and formed the motivating examples for the more general notion of leavitt path algebra it is easy to see that for n 2 if rn is the graph having one vertex and n loops the rose with n petals graph then lk rn lk 1 n it is clear from that each lk rn is purely infinite simple it is straightforward from that k 0 lk rn m rn is the cyclic group z n 1 z of order n 1 where the regular module lk rn in k 0 lk rn corresponds to 1 in z n 1 z now let d 2 and consider the graph rdn having two vertices v 1 v 2 d 1 edges from v 1 to v 2 and n loops at v 2 rdn v 1 d 1 v 2 n ff it is shown in aalp that the matrix algebra md lk 1 n is isomorphic to lk r d n by standardmorita equivalence theory k 0 md lk 1 n k 0 lk 1 n moreover the element md lk 1 n of k 0 md lk 1 n corresponds to the ele ment d in z n 1 z in particular the element mn 1 lk 1 n ofk 0 mn 1 lk 1 n corresponds to n 1 0 in z n 1 z finally an easy computation yields that det i 2 a t rd n n 1 0 for all n d therefore by invoking the algebraic kp theorem the previous discussion immediately yields the following proposition 7 suppose e is a graph for which lk e is unital purely infinite simple suppose that m e is isomorphic to the cyclic group z n 1 z via an iso morphism which takes the element v e 0 v of m e to the element d of z n 1 z finally suppose that det i e 0 a t e is negative then lk e md lk 1 n we now have all the ingredients in place to achieve our main result theorem 8 for each n 1 let cn denote the cayley graph corresponding to the cyclic group z nz with respect to the subset 1 n 1 as described previously leavitt path algebras of cayley graphs arising from cyclic groups 9 then up to isomorphism the collection of leavitt path algebras lk cn n n is completely described by the following four pairwise non isomorphic classes of k algebras 1 lk cn lk cm in case m 1 or 5 mod 6 and n 1 or 5 mod 6 in this case these algebras are isomorphic to lk 1 2 2 lk cn lk cm in case m 2 or 4 mod 6 and n 2 or 4 mod 6 in this case these algebras are isomorphic to m 3 lk 1 4 3 lk cn lk cm in case m n 3 mod 6 4 lk cn lk cm in case m n 6 mod 6 proof we seek to invoke the algebraic kp theorem by proposition 1 lk cn is purely infinite simple for each n n for any of the four indicated cases we choose a pair of integers m n by corollary 4 and we have k 0 lk cn k 0 lk cm and by the observation made subsequent to lemma 5 together with this isomorphism necessarily takes lk cn to lk cm by proposition 6 det in a t cn and det im a t cm are both nonpositive the algebraic kp theorem now gives the bulk of the result the two extra statements in parts i and ii follow directly from statements i and ii of corollary 4 together with proposition 7 in aap 3 a description is given of the leavitt path algebras associated to
