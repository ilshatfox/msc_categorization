suggesting question 1 2 and for helpful comments the author is indebted to p etingof for his help with the proofs and for his interest in the paper and encouragement the author thanks v ostrik for telling him about the paper r the research was partially supported by the israel science foundation grant no 317 09 2 the main results the following standard lemma shows that without loss of generality we may and shall work over an algebraically closed field lemma 2 1 if c is a locally finite abelian category over a field k then the map gr c gr c k k is injective proof it is well known that c is equivalent to the category of finite dimensional a comodules over k where a is a coalgebra over k let us denote gr c by gr a we need to show that the map gr a gr a k k is injective clearly we may assume that a is finite dimensional so c rep a then we can pass to the quotient of a by its radical and assume that a is semisimple so we can assume that a is simple i e a matn d d a division algebra over k but in this case the claim is obvious since gr a z virtually indecomposable tensor categories 3 corollary 2 2 a tensor category c over k is virtually indecomposable if c k k is virtually indecomposable therefore throughout the paper we shall work over an algebraically closed field k 2 1 based rings in section 3 1 we recall the definition of a unital based ring and then prove in section 3 2 the following theorem about them theorem 2 3 let a be any unital based ring then a is virtually indecomposable recall that a k linear abelian rigid tensor category c is said to have the cheval ley property if the tensor product of any two semisimple objects of c is also semi simple in other words the subcategory css of semisimple objects in c is a tensor subcategory for example in characteristic zero c rep g and c rep g where g is any group and g is any lie algebra have the chevalley property c of course if c is semisimple e g a fusion category then c has the chevalley property now if c has the chevalley property then gr c gr css so gr c is a unital based ring hence theorem 2 3 implies the following corollary corollary 2 4 let c be a k linear abelian rigid tensor category if c has the chevalley property then c is virtually indecomposable remark 2 5 in general it is not true that the representation categories of groups and lie algebras in positive characteristic have the chevalley property and likewise for supergroups and lie superalgebras in any characteristic 2 2 the hopf algebra case in section 4 we prove the following innocent looking result which will turn out to play the key role in proving our results concerning super groups and super lie algebras theorem 2 6 let h be a not necessarily commutative hopf algebra over a field k and let corep h denote the tensor category of finite dimensional h comodules over k suppose that i is a hopf ideal in h such that n 1 i n 0 let r be any commutative ring and if the characteristic of k is p 0 assume that n 1 p nr 0 then if corep h i is virtually indecomposable over r then so is corep h remark 2 7 in fact theorem 2 6 holds also with the same proof in the topo logical case i e when h is a topological hopf algebra see below 2 3 the group case in section 5 we use theorem 2 6 to prove increasingly strong results culminating in the following theorem theorem 2 8 let k be any field and let g be an affine group scheme over k let s be the set of all primes not equal to the characteristic of k and not dividing g g 0 then spec z s 1 z gr g is connected theorem 2 8 generalizes to formal groups recall that a formal group g over a field k whose subset of closed points reduced part is the affine proalgebraic group g over k is the following algebraic structure we have a structure alge bra o g over k which has an ideal i such that o g i o g and o g is complete and separated in the topology defined by i i e o g lim o g im finally we have a cocommutative coproduct o g o g o g where the 4 shlomo gelaki latter completed tensor product is lim o g im o g im defining a topological hopf algebra structure on o g such that i is a hopf ideal and the isomorphism o g i o g is a hopf algebra isomorphism thus combining theorems 2 6 and 2 8 we obtain the following result theorem 2 9 let k be any field and let g be a formal group over k with reduced part g let s be the set of all primes not equal to the characteristic of k and not dividing g g 0 then spec z s 1 z gr g is connected therefore as an immediate corollary of theorem 2 9 the case g 1 we deduce a positive answer to the second part of serre s question 1 2 nevertheless in section 4 3 we shall also give a self contained proof of this theorem in the positive characteristic case theorem 2 10 let g be a lie algebra over any field k and let c rep g be the category of finite dimensional representations of g over k then spec gr g is connected remark 2 11 note that the case g 1 formal groups with one closed point re duces to lie algebras in characteristic zero but in positive characteristic it contains much more recall that a hopf algebra h over a field k is called coconnected if every simple h comodule over k is trivial see e g eg where in particular coconnected hopf algebras over c are classified in theorem 4 2 we have the following result which extends corollary 2 10 theorem 2 12 let h be a coconnected hopf algebra over any field k and let s be the set of all primes not equal to the characteristic of k then rep h is virtually indecomposable over z s 1 proof if h is coconnected then h is a topological hopf algebra with maximal ideal i ker which is complete and separated in the topology defined by i as the powers of i are orthogonal to the terms of the coradical filtration of h so the claim follows from the topological version of theorem 2 6 see remark 2 7 2 4 the supergroup case in section 6 1 we recall the notion of a hopf super algebra and in section 6 2 we recall the notions of an affine supergroup scheme and a formal supergroup over k we then generalize in section 6 3 the results from section 5 to the super case assuming the characteristic of k 6 2 let g be an affine supergroup scheme or more generally a formal supergroup and let u g be an element of order 2 acting by parity on the algebra of regular functions o g let rep g u be the category of representations of g on finite dimensional supervector spaces over k on which u acts by parity and let gr g u be its grothendieck ring theorem 2 13 let k be any field of characteristic 6 2 let g be an affine super group scheme over k or more generally a formal supergroup over k let s be the set of all primes 6 2 not equal to the characteristic of k and not dividing g g 0 then spec z s 1 z gr g u is connected remark 2 14 note that the prime 2 must be excluded i e cannot be inverted indeed already in the category supervect of finite dimensional supervector spaces over k see section 6 the element 1 2 k 0 k 1 is a nontrivial idempotent virtually indecomposable tensor categories 5 recall that a lie superalgebra over a field k is a lie algebra in supervect see e g b in other words a lie superalgebra g g 0 g 1 is a supervector space over k equipped with an operation g g g satisfying the following axioms x y 1 x y y x and x y z x y z 1 x y y x z for homoge neous elements x y g and z g the following result on lie superalgebras is an immediate corollary of theorem 2 13 corollary 2 15 let g be a lie superalgebra over a field k of characteristic 6 2 let s be the set of all primes 6 2 not equal to the characteristic of k then spec z s 1 z gr g is connected by a theorem of deligne d in characteristic zero the categories rep g u ex haust all k linear abelian symmetric rigid tensor categories of exponential growth hence we deduce the following corollary corollary 2 16 if c is a k linear abelian symmetric rigid tensor category of exponential growth over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic zero then c is virtually indecomposable recall that a super tannakian category over a field k is a k linear abelian sym metric rigid tensor category c with end 1 k where 1 denotes the unit object which admits a fiber functor to the category of finite dimensional super vector spaces see d in the following proposition we deduce a positive answer to the first part of serre s question 1 2 proposition 2 17 a super tannakian category c over any field k is virtually indecomposable proof by the super analog of a theorem of deligne milne dm which is in d c is equivalent to a category of the form rep g u so the claim follows by theorem 2 13 3 the virtually indecomposability of a unital based ring in characteristic zero there is an alternative combinatorial proof of a slight generalization of theorem 1 1 in the framework of unital based rings 3 1 based rings let a be a free z algebra with a distinguished z basis bi not necessarily of finite rank which contains the unit element such that bibj k nkijbk where n k ij z the map i nibi i mibi 7 i nimi defines a positive inner product a a z on a we call a a unital based ring if there is an involution i 7 i such that the induced map x i nibi 7 x i nibi satisfies xy z x zy y x z for all x y z a in particular it follows that the matrix of multiplication by x is transposed to the matrix of multiplication by x for any x a example 3 1 if c is a k linear semisimple rigid tensor category its grothendieck ring gr c is a unital based ring a typical example of such category is the category c corep h of finite dimensional comodules of a cosemisimple hopf algebra h the distinguished z basis of gr c is formed by the isomorphism classes of the simple h comodules and the involution is given by taking the k linear dual of a comodule 6 shlomo gelaki 3 2 the proof of theorem 2 3 let e 6 1 be a central idempotent in a we have to show that e 0 we first note that e is a projection operator on an inner product space which is normal i e ee e e so e is self adjoint indeed e 1 e e 1 e e e 1 e 1 e ee 1 e 1 e 0 thus by positivity of the inner product e 1 e 0 so e ee hence e e then e is an orthogonal projector to a proper subspace of r z a which does not contain 1 so 0 e e e 1 e 1 1 1 1 but e e is an integer so e e 0 and hence e 0 remark 3 2 it is interesting to mention here a classical result of kaplansky which asserts that there is no nontrivial idempotent in the integral group ring of any not necessarily commutative group see k p i e the integral group ring of any group is strongly virtually indecomposable equivalently the tensor category v ecg ofg graded vector spaces over k is strongly virtually indecomposable for any group g in fact proposition 3 in r extends the result of kaplansky to fusion rings unital based rings of finite rank equivalently any fusion category is strongly virtually indecomposable 4 the proof of theorem 2 6 in this section we let h be a hopf algebra not necessarily commutative over k and c corep h be the category of finite dimensional right comodules of h then c is a k linear abelian rigid tensor category in which every object has a finite length let gr c be the grothendieck ring of c it is the free z algebra with a distinguished basis formed by the classes x of the simple objects x c 4 1 characters in hopf algebras recall that any m c has a canonical rational h module structure definition 4 1 for an object m c the character ch m of m is the character of the h module m in other words the character ch m is the function h k defined by ch m x tr x m clearly ch m h ch m ch n ch m n and ch m ch n ch m n moreover if m 1 mn are the distinct composition factors of m with mul tiplicities a 1 an then ch m n i 1 aich mi in other words the character of m and the character of its semisimplification ni 1 aimi coincide we therefore have a well defined k algebra homomorphism ch k z gr c h a m 7 a ch m proposition 4 2 the character map ch is injective in other words if m n c with ch m ch n then m n in k z gr c proof it is enough to show that if m i 1 aich mi 0 on h for some finite number of non isomorphic irreducible comodules mi c and some elements ai k then ai 0 for all i indeed by the density theorem the map h iendk mi is surjective so we can choose an element x h which maps to 0 on endk mj for j 6 i and to an element with trace 1 on endk mi which implies that ai 0 for all i virtually indecomposable tensor categories 7 remark 4 3 note that if the characteristic of k is zero then proposition 4 2 implies that the character of m determines the composition factors of m together with their multiplicities i e ch gr c h is injective so in particular if m n are semisimple then m n are isomorphic on the other hand if the characteristic of k is p 0 then proposition 4 2 implies only that the character of m determines the composition factors of m together with their multiplicities modulo p 4 2 the proof of theorem 2 6 set c corep h i the surjection of hopf algebras h h i induces a tensor functor c c which in turn induces a ring homomorphism r z gr c r z gr c suppose e r z gr c is an idempotent which is not 0 or 1 and let e be the image of e in r z gr c by assumption e is either 0 or 1 without loss of generality we may assume that e 0 replacing e by 1 e if needed now if k has characteristic p 0 at least one of the coefficients of e is not divisible by p indeed if e pf then en pnfn e so e pnr z gr c for all n and hence it is zero which is a contradiction therefore the image e of e in r z k z gr c which is r pr fp k z gr c in positive characteristic is nonzero and the image e of e in r z k z gr c is zero as e 0 now using the embedding ch k z gr c h we get a nonzero idempotent ch e in r z h which has zero image in r z h i this image is ch e this implies that ch e r z i but since ch e is an idempotent ch e n ch e for all n so ch e n 1 r z i n 0 which is a contradiction 4 3 a proof of theorem 2 10 let g be a lie algebra over a field k of character istic p 0 we may assume without loss of generality that k is algebraically closed see corollary 2 2 let a u g be the dual algebra of the universal enveloping algebra u g of g it is a topological hopf algebra in the topology defined by the maximal ideal i of a let e gr g be an idempotent which is not 0 or 1 we can assume that tre 1 0 modulo p by replacing e with 1 e if needed now at least one of the coefficients of e is not divisible by p indeed otherwise e p n e pn so e pn gr g for all n but e pn does not have integer coefficients for large enough n consequently the image e of e in k z gr g is nonzero hence using proposition 4 2 we get a nonzero idempotent ch e in a on the other hand the augmentation map a k maps ch e to zero since tre 1 0 modulo p so ch e is contained in i but ch e is an idempotent so it is contained in any power in of i but n 1 i n 0 so ch e is zero which is a contradiction 5 the proof of theorem 2 8 the proof of theorem 2 8 will be carried in several steps 5 1 g is a reductive abelian affine algebraic group over k recall that if g is a reductive abelian affine algebraic group over k then g g 0 a where g 0 gnm is the n dimensional torus over k and a is a finite abelian group of order prime to p in case the characteristic of k is p 0 see e g sp in particular all finite dimensional simple representations of g over k are 1 dimensional and their isomorphism types are parameterized by pairs z where z zn and a thus all idempotents in q z gr g can be easily described in this case they involve a factor of 1 a so the result follows in a straightforward manner 8 shlomo gelaki 5 2 g is any abelian affine algebraic group over k recall that if g is an abelian affine algebraic group over k then g gs gu where gs and gu are the subgroups of semisimple and unipotent elements of g respectively see e g sp so rep g and rep gs have the same grothendieck rings and the claim follows from 5 1 5 3 g is any affine algebraic group over k let g be any affine algebraic group over k and leto g be its coordinate hopf algebra it is a finitely generated commu tative reduced hopf algebra over k suppose e gr rep g gr corep o g is an idempotent then ch e o g is an idempotent so in particular a class function on g taking the values 0 1 here we are using the trick with dividing by p as we did in the proof of theorem 2 6 which explains why we cannot invert p therefore it suffices to prove that ch e g ch e 1 for all g g but for that purpose we may assume that g is the zariski closure of the cyclic group with generator g so g is abelian and the claim follows from 5 2 5 4 g is an affine proalgebraic group over k let g be an affine proalgebraic group over k and leto g be its coordinate hopf algebra over k it is a commutative reduced hopf algebra over k not necessarily finitely generated but it is well known that o g is the inductive limit of its finitely generated hopf subalgebras see e g a so the claim follows in a straightforward manner from part 5 3 5 5 g is an affine group scheme over k let g be an affine group scheme and let o g be the commutative hopf algebra representing the group functor g it is not necessarily reduced see e g w since k is algebraically closed it is well known essentially by hilbert nullstellensatz that the nilradical i of o g is a hopf ideal now the commutative reduced hopf algebra o g i over k represents an affine proalgebraic group over k so by 5 4 corep o g i is virtually indecomposable finally since n 1 i n 0 it follows from theorem 2 6 that corep o g rep g is virtually indecomposable as claimed this concludes the proof of theorem 2 8 6 the proof of theorem 2 13 6 1 hopf superalgebras recall that a hopf superalgebra over a field k is a hopf algebra in the k linear abelian symmetric tensor category supervect of supervector spaces over k see e g b in other words a hopf superalgebra h h 0 h 1 is an ordinary z 2 graded associative unital algebra over k i e a superalgebra equipped with a coassociative morphism h h h in supervect which is multiplicative in the super sense and with a counit and antipode satisfying the standard axioms here multiplicativity in the super sense means that satisfies the relation ab 1 a 2 b 1 a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 where a b h are homogeneous elements a and b denote the degrees of a and b a a 1 a 2 and b b 1 b 2 a hopf superalgebra h is said to be commutative if ab 1 a b ba for all homogeneous elements a b h let j h h 1 h 2 1 h 1 be the hopf ideal of h generated by the odd elements h 1 then the quotient h h j h is an ordinary hopf algebra note that if h is commutative then j h consists of nilpotent elements virtually indecomposable tensor categories 9 let us recall the following useful construction introduced in section 3 1 in aeg let h be any hopf superalgebra over k and let h k z 2 h be the semidirect product hopf superalgebra with comultiplication and antipode s where the generator g of z 2 acts on h by ghg 1 1 h h for x h write x 0 x 1 x where 0 x h h 0 and 1 x h h 1 then one can define an ordinary hopf algebra structure on the algebra h h with comultiplication and antipode maps given by h 0 h 1 h g 1 1 h and s h g h s h h h see theorem 3 1 1 in aeg theorem 6 1 let h be a hopf superalgebra over a field k of characteristic 6 2 and let corep h be the tensor category of finite dimensional h comodules in supervect over k the tensor categories corep h and corep h are equivalent proof an h comodule in supervect is a continuous z 2 graded h module in the category vect of vector spaces over k which is the same as a continuous module over the algebra k z 2 h but k z 2 h is isomorphic to h as an algebra so a h comodule in supervect is the same thing as a h comodule in vect finally it is easy to check that this equivalence is in fact a tensor equivalence we note that as a consequence of theorem 6 1 we can define the character map ch k z gr corep h h a m 7 a ch m and deduce from proposition 4 2 that it is an injective k algebra homomorphism 6 2 affine supergroup schemes and formal supergroups recall that an affine supergroup scheme g is the spectrum of a not necessarily finitely generated commutative hopf superalgebra o g over k see e g d in other words it is a functor g from the category of supercommutative algebras to the category of groups defined by a 7 g a hom o g a where hom o g a is the group of algebra maps o g a in supervect recall that a formal supergroup g over a field k with reduced part g is the following algebraic structure we have a superalgebra o g over k which has an ideal i such that o g is complete and separated in the topology defined by i i e o g lim o g im and o g i o g finally we have a supercocom mutative coproduct o g o g o g where the latter completed tensor product is lim o g im o g im defining a topological hopf algebra structure on o g such that i is a hopf ideal and the isomorphism o g i o g is a hopf superalgebra isomorphism let g be an affine supergroup scheme the ordinary commutative hopf algebra o g is isomorphic to o g for some affine group scheme g which is referred to as the even part of g let g be an affine supergroup scheme over k or more generally a formal su pergroup over k and let rep g denote the category of finite dimensional algebraic representations of g in supervect over k then rep g is a k linear abelian sym metric rigid tensor category with end 1 k where 1 denotes the unit object which admits a fiber functor a symmetric tensor functor to the full k linear abelian symmetric rigid tensor subcategory of supervect whose objects are the finite dimensional supervector spaces just like in the even case rep g is equiva lent to corep o g 10 shlomo gelaki 6 3 the proof of theorem 2 13 let g be an affine supergroup scheme over k let h o g be the commutative hopf superalgebra representing the group functor g and let h be the ordinary hopf algebra associated with h then the quotient h k z 2 j h is a commutative hopf algebra representing the group functor z 2 g where g is the even part of g therefore corep h k z 2 j h is virtually indecomposable by theorem 2 8 and it follows from theorems 2 6 and 6 1 that corep h is virtually indecomposable as claimed for formal supergroups g over k the proof is completely parallel using theorem 2 9 about formal groups over k references a e abe hopf algebras translated from the japanese by hisae kinoshita and hiroko tanaka

proof it is well known that c is equivalent to the category of finite dimensional a comodules over k where a is a coalgebra over k let us denote gr c by gr a we need to show that the map gr a gr a k k is injective clearly we may assume that a is finite dimensional so c rep a then we can pass to the quotient of a by its radical and assume that a is semisimple so we can assume that a is simple i e a matn d d a division algebra over k but in this case the claim is obvious since gr a z corollary 2 2 a tensor category c over k is virtually indecomposable if c k k is virtually indecomposable therefore throughout the paper we shall work over an algebraically closed field k 2 1 based rings in section 3 1 we recall the definition of a unital based ring and then prove in section 3 2 the following theorem about them theorem 2 3 let a be any unital based ring then a is virtually indecomposable recall that a k linear abelian rigid tensor category c is said to have the chevalley property if the tensor product of any two semisimple objects of c is also semisimple in other words the subcategory css 4 shlomo gelaki of semisimple objects in c is a tensor subcategory for example in characteristic zero c rep g and c rep g where g is any group and g is any lie algebra have the chevalley property c of course if c is semisimple e g a fusion category then c has the chevalley property now if c has the chevalley property then gr c gr css so gr c is a unital based ring hence theorem 2 3 implies the following corollary corollary 2 4 let c be a k linear abelian rigid tensor category if c has the chevalley property then c is virtually indecomposable remark 2 5 in general it is not true that the representation cat egories of groups and lie algebras in positive characteristic have the chevalley property and likewise for supergroups and lie superalgebras in any characteristic 2 2 the hopf algebra case in section 4 we prove the following innocent looking result which will turn out to play the key role in proving our results concerning super groups and super lie algebras theorem 2 6 let h be a not necessarily commutative hopf algebra over a field k and let corep h denote the tensor category of finite dimensional h comodules over k suppose that i is a hopf ideal in h such that n 1 i n 0 let r be any commutative ring and if the characteristic of k is p 0 assume that n 1 p nr 0 then if corep h i is virtually indecomposable over r then so is corep h remark 2 7 in fact theorem 2 6 holds also with the same proof in the topological case i e when h is a topological hopf algebra see below 2 3 the group case in section 5 we use theorem 2 6 to prove in creasingly strong results culminating in the following theorem theorem 2 8 let k be any field and let g be an affine group scheme over k let s be the set of all primes not equal to the characteristic of k and not dividing g g 0 then spec z s 1 z gr g is connected theorem 2 8 generalizes to formal groups recall that a formal group g over a field k whose subset of closed points reduced part is the affine proalgebraic group g over k is the following algebraic structure we have a structure algebra o g over k which has an ideal i such that o g i o g and o g is complete and separated in the topology defined by i i e o g lim o g im finally we have a cocommutative coproduct o g o g o g where the virtually indecomposable tensor categories 5 latter completed tensor product is lim o g im o g im defining a topological hopf algebra structure on o g such that i is a hopf ideal and the isomorphism o g i o g is a hopf algebra isomorphism thus combining theorems 2 6 and 2 8 we obtain the following re sult theorem 2 9 let k be any field and let g be a formal group over k with reduced part g let s be the set of all primes not equal to the characteristic of k and not dividing g g 0 then spec z s 1 z gr g is connected therefore as an immediate corollary of theorem 2 9 the case g 1 we deduce a positive answer to the second part of serre s question 1 2 nevertheless in section 4 3 we shall also give a self contained proof of this theorem in the positive characteristic case theorem 2 10 let g be a lie algebra over any field k and let c rep g be the category of finite dimensional representations of g over k then spec gr g is connected remark 2 11 note that the case g 1 formal groups with one closed point reduces to lie algebras in characteristic zero but in pos itive characteristic it contains much more recall that a hopf algebra h over a field k is called coconnected if every simple h comodule over k is trivial see e g eg where in particular coconnected hopf algebras over c are classified in theorem 4 2 we have the following result which extends corollary 2 10 theorem 2 12 let h be a coconnected hopf algebra over any field k and let s be the set of all primes not equal to the characteristic of k then rep h is virtually indecomposable over z s 1 proof if h is coconnected then h is a topological hopf algebra with maximal ideal i ker which is complete and separated in the topology defined by i as the powers of i are orthogonal to the terms of the coradical filtration of h so the claim follows from the topological version of theorem 2 6 see remark 2 7 2 4 the supergroup case in section 6 1 we recall the notion of a hopf superalgebra and in section 6 2 we recall the notions of an affine supergroup scheme and a formal supergroup over k we then generalize in section 6 3 the results from section 5 to the super case assuming the characteristic of k 6 2 let g be an affine supergroup scheme or more generally a formal supergroup and let u g be an element of order 2 acting by parity on 6 shlomo gelaki the algebra of regular functions o g let rep g u be the category of representations of g on finite dimensional supervector spaces over k on which u acts by parity and let gr g u be its grothendieck ring theorem 2 13 let k be any field of characteristic 6 2 let g be an affine supergroup scheme over k or more generally a formal super group over k let s be the set of all primes 6 2 not equal to the char acteristic of k and not dividing g g 0 then spec z s 1 zgr g u is connected remark 2 14 note that the prime 2 must be excluded i e can not be inverted indeed already in the category supervect of finite dimensional supervector spaces over k see section 6 the element 1 2 k 0 k 1 is a nontrivial idempotent recall that a lie superalgebra over a field k is a lie algebra in supervect see e g b in other words a lie superalgebra g g 0 g 1 is a supervector space over k equipped with an operation g g g satisfying the following axioms x y 1 x y y x and x y z x y z 1 x y y x z for homogeneous elements x y g and z g the following result on lie superalgebras is an immediate corol lary of theorem 2 13 corollary 2 15 let g be a lie superalgebra over a field k of char acteristic 6 2 let s be the set of all primes 6 2 not equal to the characteristic of k then spec z s 1 z gr g is connected by a theorem of deligne d in characteristic zero the categories rep g u exhaust all k linear abelian symmetric rigid tensor cate gories of exponential growth hence we deduce the following corollary corollary 2 16 if c is a k linear abelian symmetric rigid tensor category of exponential growth over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic zero then c is virtually indecomposable recall that a super tannakian category over a field k is a k linear abelian symmetric rigid tensor category c with end 1 k where 1 denotes the unit object which admits a fiber functor to the category of finite dimensional super vector spaces see d in the following proposition we deduce a positive answer to the first part of serre s question 1 2 proposition 2 17 a super tannakian category c over any field k is virtually indecomposable proof by the super analog of a theorem of deligne milne dm which is in d c is equivalent to a category of the form rep g u so the claim follows by theorem 2 13 virtually indecomposable tensor categories 7 3 the virtually indecomposability of a unital based ring in characteristic zero there is an alternative combinatorial proof of a slight generalization of theorem 1 1 in the framework of unital based rings 3 1 based rings let a be a ring with a distinguished z basis bi i i not necessarily of finite rank which contains the unit ele ment 1 such that bibj k nkijbk where n k ij z the bilinear map i nibi i mibi 7 i nimi defines a positive inner product a a z on a we call a a unital based ring if there is an invo lution i 7 i such that the induced map x i nibi 7 x i nibi satisfies xy z x zy y x z for all x y z a in particular it follows that the matrix of multiplication by x is transposed to the matrix of multiplication by x for any x a example 3 1 if c is a k linear semisimple rigid tensor category its grothendieck ring gr c is a unital based ring a typical example of such category is the category c corep h of finite dimensional co modules of a cosemisimple hopf algebra h the distinguished z basis of gr c consists of the isomorphism classes of simple h comodules and the involution is given by taking the k linear dual of a comodule 3 2 the proof of theorem 2 3 let e 6 1 be a central idempotent in a we have to show that e 0 we first note that e is a projection operator on an inner product space which is normal i e ee e e so e is self adjoint indeed e 1 e e 1 e e e 1 e 1 e ee 1 e 1 e 0 thus by positivity of the inner product e 1 e 0 so e ee hence e e then e is an orthogonal projector to a proper subspace of r z a which does not contain 1 so 0 e e e 1 e 1 1 1 1 but e e is an integer so e e 0 and hence e 0 remark 3 2 it is interesting to mention here a classical result of kaplansky which asserts that there is no nontrivial idempotent in the integral group ring of any not necessarily commutative group see k p i e the integral group ring of any group is strongly virtually indecomposable equivalently the tensor category v ecg of g graded vector spaces over k is strongly virtually indecomposable for any group g in fact proposition 3 in r extends the result of kaplansky to fusion rings unital based rings of finite rank equivalently any fusion category is strongly virtually indecomposable 8 shlomo gelaki 4 the proof of theorem 2 6 in this section we let h be a hopf algebra not necessarily commuta tive over k and c corep h be the category of finite dimensional right comodules of h then c is a k linear abelian rigid tensor cat egory in which every object has a finite length let gr c be the grothendieck ring of c it is the free z algebra with a distinguished basis formed by the classes x of the simple objects x c 4 1 characters in hopf algebras recall that any m c has a canonical rational h module structure definition 4 1 for an object m c the character ch m ofm is the character of the h module m in other words the character ch m is the function h k defined by ch m x tr x m clearly ch m h ch m ch n ch m n and ch m ch n ch m n moreover if m 1 mn are the distinct com position factors of m with multiplicities a 1 an then ch m n i 1 aich mi in other words the character of m and the character of its semisimplification ni 1 aimi coincide we therefore have a well defined k algebra homomorphism ch k z gr c h a m 7 a ch m proposition 4 2 the character map ch is injective in other words if m n c with ch m ch n then m n in k z gr c proof it is enough to show that if m i 1 aich mi 0 on h for some finite number of non isomorphic irreducible comodules mi c and some elements ai k then ai 0 for all i indeed by the density theorem the map h iendk mi is sur jective so we can choose an element x h which maps to 0 on endk mj for j 6 i and to an element with trace 1 on endk mi which implies that ai 0 for all i remark 4 3 note that if the characteristic of k is zero then propo sition 4 2 implies that the character of m determines the composition factors of m together with their multiplicities i e ch gr c h is injective so in particular if m n are semisimple then m n are isomorphic on the other hand if the characteristic of k is p 0 then proposition 4 2 implies only that the character of m determines the composition factors of m together with their multiplicities modulo p 4 2 the proof of theorem 2 6 set c corep h i the surjec tion of hopf algebras h h i induces a tensor functor c c which virtually indecomposable tensor categories 9 in turn induces a ring homomorphism r z gr c r z gr c suppose e r z gr c is an idempotent which is not 0 or 1 and let e be the image of e in r z gr c by assumption e is either 0 or 1 without loss of generality we may assume that e 0 replacing e by 1 e if needed now if k has characteristic p 0 at least one of the coefficients of e is not divisible by p indeed if e pf then en pnf n e so e pnr z gr c for all n and hence it is zero which is a contradiction therefore the image e of e in r z k zgr c which is r pr fp k zgr c in positive characteristic is nonzero and the image e of e in r z k z gr c is zero as e 0 now using the embedding ch k z gr c h we get a nonzero idempotent ch e in r z h which has zero image in r z h i this image is ch e this implies that ch e r z i but since ch e is an idempotent ch e n ch e for all n so ch e n 1 r zi n 0 which is a contradiction 4 3 a proof of theorem 2 10 let g be a lie algebra over a field k of characteristic p 0 we may assume without loss of generality that k is algebraically closed see corollary 2 2 let a u g be the dual algebra of the universal enveloping algebra u g of g it is a topological hopf algebra in the topology defined by the maximal ideal i of a let e gr g be an idempotent which is not 0 or 1 we can assume that tre 1 0 modulo p by replacing e with 1 e if needed now at least one of the coefficients of e is not divisible by p indeed otherwise e p n e pn so e pn gr g for all n but e pn does not have integer coefficients for large enough n consequently the image e of e in k z gr g is nonzero hence using proposition 4 2 we get a nonzero idempotent ch e in a on the other hand the augmentation map a k maps ch e to zero since tre 1 0 modulo p so ch e is contained in i but ch e is an idempotent so it is contained in any power in of i but n 1 i n 0 so ch e is zero which is a contradiction 5 the proof of theorem 2 8 the proof of theorem 2 8 will be carried in several steps 5 1 g is a reductive abelian affine algebraic group over k re call that if g is a reductive abelian affine algebraic group over k then g g 0 a where g 0 gnm is the n dimensional torus over k and a is a finite abelian group of order prime to p in case the character istic of k is p 0 see e g sp in particular all finite dimensional 10 shlomo gelaki simple representations of g over k are 1 dimensional and their iso morphism types are parameterized by pairs z where z zn and a thus all idempotents in q z gr g can be easily described in this case they involve a factor of 1 a so the result follows in a straightforward manner 5 2 g is any abelian affine algebraic group over k recall that if g is an abelian affine algebraic group over k then g gs gu where gs and gu are the subgroups of semisimple and unipotent elements of g respectively see e g sp so rep g and rep gs have the same grothendieck rings and the claim follows from 5 1 5 3 g is any affine algebraic group over k let g be any affine algebraic group over k and let o g be its coordinate hopf algebra it is a finitely generated commutative reduced hopf algebra over k suppose e gr rep g gr corep o g is an idempotent then ch e o g is an idempotent so in particular a class function on g taking the values 0 1 here we are using the trick with dividing by p as we did in the proof of theorem 2 6 which explains why we cannot invert p therefore it suffices to prove that ch e g ch e 1 for all g g but for that purpose we may assume that g is the zariski closure of the cyclic group with generator g so g is abelian and the claim follows from 5 2 5 4 g is an affine proalgebraic group over k let g be an affine proalgebraic group over k and let o g be its coordinate hopf algebra over k it is a commutative reduced hopf algebra over k not necessarily finitely generated but it is well known that o g is the inductive limit of its finitely generated hopf subalgebras see e g a so the claim follows in a straightforward manner from part 5 3 5 5 g is an affine group scheme over k let g be an affine group scheme and let o g be the commutative hopf algebra representing the group functor g it is not necessarily reduced see e g w since k is algebraically closed it is well known essentially by hilbert null stellensatz that the nilradical i of o g is a hopf ideal now the commutative reduced hopf algebra o g i over k represents an affine proalgebraic group over k so by 5 4 corep o g i is virtually inde composable finally since n 1 i n 0 it follows from theorem 2 6 that corep o g rep g is virtually indecomposable as claimed this concludes the proof of theorem 2 8 virtually indecomposable tensor categories 11 6 the proof of theorem 2 13 6 1 hopf superalgebras recall that a hopf superalgebra over a field k is a hopf algebra in the k linear abelian symmetric tensor category supervect of supervector spaces over k see e g b in other words a hopf superalgebra h h 0 h 1 is an ordinary z 2 graded associative unital algebra over k i e a superalgebra equipped with a coassocia tive morphism h h h in supervect which is multiplicative in the super sense and with a counit and antipode satisfying the stan dard axioms here multiplicativity in the super sense means that satisfies the relation ab 1 a 2 b 1 a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 where a b h are homogeneous elements a and b denote the degrees of a and b a a 1 a 2 and b b 1 b 2 a hopf superalgebra h is said to be commutative if ab 1 a b ba for all homogeneous elements a b h let j h h 1 h 2 1 h 1 be the hopf ideal of h generated by the odd elements h 1 then the quotient h h j h is an ordinary hopf algebra note that if h is commutative then j h consists of nilpotent elements let us recall the following useful construction introduced in sec tion 3 1 in aeg let h be any hopf superalgebra over k and let h k z 2 h be the semidirect product hopf superalgebra with co multiplication and antipode s where the generator g of z 2 acts on h by ghg 1 1 h h for x h write x 0 x 1 x where 0 x h h 0 and 1 x h h 1 then one can define an ordinary hopf algebra structure on the algebra h h with comultiplication and antipode maps given by h 0 h 1 h g 1 1 h and s h g h s h h h see theorem 3 1 1 in aeg theorem 6 1 let h be a hopf superalgebra over a field k of character istic 6 2 and let corep h be the tensor category of finite dimensional h comodules in supervect over k the tensor categories corep h and corep h are equivalent proof an h comodule in supervect is a continuous z 2 graded h module in the category vect of vector spaces over k which is the same as a continuous module over the algebra k z 2 h but k z 2 h is isomorphic to h as an algebra so a h comodule in supervect is the same thing as a h comodule in vect finally it is easy to check that this equivalence is in fact a tensor equivalence 12 shlomo gelaki we note that as a consequence of theorem 6 1 we can define the character map ch k z gr corep h h a m 7 a ch m and deduce from proposition 4 2 that it is an injective k algebra ho momorphism 6 2 affine supergroup schemes and formal supergroups re call that an affine supergroup scheme g is the spectrum of a not nec essarily finitely generated commutative hopf superalgebra o g over k see e g d in other words it is a functor g from the category of supercommutative algebras to the category of groups defined by a 7 g a hom o g a where hom o g a is the group of algebra maps o g a in supervect recall that a formal supergroup g over a field k with reduced part g is the following algebraic structure we have a superalgebra o g over k which has an ideal i such that o g is complete and sepa rated in the topology defined by i i e o g lim o g im and o g i o g finally we have a supercocommutative coproduct o g o g o g where the latter completed tensor prod uct is lim o g im o g im defining a topological hopf algebra structure on o g such that i is a hopf ideal and the isomorphism o g i o g is a hopf superalgebra isomorphism let g be an affine supergroup scheme the ordinary commutative hopf algebra o g is isomorphic to o g for some affine group scheme g which is referred to as the even part of g let g be an affine supergroup scheme over k or more generally a formal supergroup over k and let rep g denote the category of finite dimensional algebraic representations of g in supervect over k then rep g is a k linear abelian symmetric rigid tensor category with end 1 k where 1 denotes the unit object which admits a fiber functor a symmetric tensor functor to the full k linear abelian symmetric rigid tensor subcategory of supervect whose objects are the finite dimensional supervector spaces just like in the even case rep g is equivalent to corep o g 6 3 the proof of theorem 2 13 let g be an affine supergroup scheme over k let h o g be the commutative hopf superalgebra representing the group functor g and let h be the ordinary hopf algebra associated with h then the quotient h k z 2 j h is a commutative hopf algebra representing the group functor z 2 g where g is the even part of g therefore corep h k z 2 j h is virtually indecomposable by theorem 2 8 and it follows from theorems 2 6 and 6 1 that corep h is virtually indecomposable as claimed virtually indecomposable tensor categories 13 for formal supergroups g over k the proof is completely parallel using theorem 2
