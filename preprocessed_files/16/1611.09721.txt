we investigate a class of noncommutative k algebras called connected quantized weyl algebras such an algebra has a pbw basis for a set of generators x 1 xn such that each pair satisfies a relation of the form xixj qijxjxi rij where qij k and rij k with in some sense sufficiently many pairs for which rij 6 0 for such an algebra it turns out that there is a single parameter q such that each qij q 1 assuming that q 6 1 we classify connected quantized weyl algebras showing that there are two types linear and cyclic when q is not a root of unity we determine the prime spectra for each type the linear case is the easier although the result depends on the parity of n and all prime ideals are completely prime in the cyclic case which can only occur if n is odd there are prime ideals for which the factors have arbitrarily large goldie rank we apply connected quantized weyl algebras to obtain presentations of two classes of quantum cluster algebras let n 3 be an odd integer we present the quantum cluster algebra of a dynkin quiver of type an 1 as a factor of a linear connected quantized weyl algebra by an ideal generated by a central element we also consider the quiver p 1 n 1 identified by fordy and marsh in their analysis of periodic quiver mutation when n is odd we show that the quantum cluster algebra of this quiver is generated by a cyclic connected quantized weyl algebra in n variables and one further generator we also present it as the factor of an iterated skew polynomial algebra in n 2 variables by an ideal generated by a central element for both classes the quantum cluster algebras are simple noetherian we establish poisson analogues of the results on prime ideals and quantum cluster alge bras we determine the poisson prime spectra for the semiclassical limits of the linear and cyclic connected quantized weyl algebras and show that when n is odd the cluster algebras of an 1 and p 1 n 1 are simple poisson algebras that can each be presented as a poisson factor of a polynomial algebra with an appropriate poisson bracket by a principal ideal generated by a poisson central element date november 1 2021 2010 mathematics subject

vladimir dot senko for his helpful comments at an early stage of this project the referee for many helpful suggestions of improvements in the exposition and bach v nguyen for pointing out some errors in our original manuscript 1 http arxiv org abs 1611 09721 v 3 2 christopher d fish and david a jordan 1 introduction this paper is mostly in the context of noncommutative ring theory in particular skew polynomial rings classification of prime ideals and applications to quantum cluster algebras the original motivation can be traced back to the classification of mutation periodic quivers by fordy and marsh 11 and to a poisson algebra p introduced by fordy 12 in a further study of some such quivers the poisson algebra p is a polynomial algebra in an odd number of indeterminates x 1 xn and it may be helpful to think of these arranged cyclically so that x 1 is adja cent to xn as well as to x 2 up to a factor of 2 the poisson bracket is such that xi xi 1 xixi 1 1 1 i n 1 where xn 1 should be interpreted as x 1 and for 1 i j n with j i 1 xi xj xixj if j i is odd xixj if j i is even 2 in the sense of 4 chapter iii 5 this algebra is quantized by the algebra cqn generated by x 1 xn subject to the relations xixi 1 qxi 1 xi 1 q 1 i n 3 where xn 1 should again be interpreted as x 1 and for 1 i j n with j i 1 xixj qxjxi if j i is odd q 1 xjxi if j i is even 4 we shall interpret the relation 3 as the defining relation for the quantized weyl algebra a q 1 generated by xi and xi 1 this is more commonly written xixi 1 qxi 1 xi 1 1 i n 5 but unless q 1 the two are isomorphic by a change of variable and 5 is less satisfactory both from the point of view of quantization as it gives a noncommutative algebra on setting q 1 and from the point of view of symmetry as it is equivalent not to xi 1 xi q 1 xixi 1 1 but to xi 1 xi q 1 xixi 1 q 1 it is possible to construct cqn as an iterated skew polynomial algebra in x 1 x 2 xn over the base field k if 1 m n the intermediate iterated skew polynomial algebra in x 1 x 2 xm will be denoted l q m when n is odd l q n and c q n both exist and are skew polynomial rings over l q n 1 as iterated skew polynomial algebras over the base field l q n and if n is odd cqn are noetherian domains with pbw bases motivated by the algebras lqn and c q n we define a connected quantized weyl algebra to be a k algebra with a finite set x 1 xn of generators such that each pair of generators satisfies a relation of the form xixj qijxjxi rij where qij k and rij k connected quantized weyl algebras and quantum cluster algebras 3 the standard monomials xa 11 x a 2 2 x an n form a pbw basis the graph g with vertices x 1 x 2 xn in which there is an edge between xi and xj if and only if rij 6 0 is connected in section 2 we shall see that provided at least one qij 6 1 l q n and c q n are the only connected quantized weyl algebras in sections 3 and 4 using a deleting derivations algorithm similar to that applied to quantum matrices by cauchon 5 we determine when q is not a root of unity the prime spectra of lqn and when n is odd c q n in the case of l q n the hypotheses of 16 theorem 2 3 are satisfied so all prime ideals are completely prime but we shall see that cqn does have prime ideals that are not completely prime in lqn there is a sequence of elements z 1 zn defined by the formula zj zj 1 xj zj 2 where z 0 1 and z 1 0 such that zn is central if n is odd and normal but not central if n is even in the odd case the non zero prime ideals of lqn are the ideals of the form zn l q n k and in the even case they are znl q n and the ideals of the form znl q n zn 1 l q n 0 6 k there is a similar sequence in cqn but with zn replaced by a central element the prime ideals of c q n are the ideals of the form cqn k and for each positive integer m two prime ideals fm 1 and fm 1 such that the factors c q n fm 1 have goldie rank m thus the prime spectrum of l q n is akin to those of u sl 2 and uq sl 2 but unless n 3 the exceptional maximal ideals are not annihilators of finite dimensional simple modules section 5 determines the k automorphism groups of lqn and c q n when q 6 1 whereas autk l q n is isomorphic to the multiplicative group k with each k corresponding to an automorphism with xi 7 1 ixi autk c q n is cyclic of order 2 n generated by the product of the k automorphism of order n such that each xi 7 xi 1 where xn 1 x 1 and the automorphism of order 2 such that each xi 7 xi in section 6 we apply connected quantized weyl algebras to quantum cluster algebras useful references for such algebras include 2 19 20 26 although there are several papers for example 19 20 showing that given noncommutative algebras have quantum cluster algebra structures there are not many in which a quantum cluster algebra is determined given a particular quiver for two classes of quivers we relate the quantum cluster algebra to connected quantized weyl algebras and obtain presentations in terms of generators and relations for an even positive integer m we present the quantum cluster algebra for a dynkin quiver of type am as a factor of the linear connected quantized weyl algebra l q m 1 for an odd integer n 3 we present the quantum cluster algebra for the periodic quiver denoted p 1 n 1 in 11 as an extension of the cyclic connected quantized weyl algebra c q 2 n requiring one further generator and also as a factor by the principal ideal generated by a central element of an iterated skew polynomial ring in n 2 variables over the base field k sections 7 and 8 present poisson analogues of earlier results in section 7 the poisson prime spectra of the semiclassical limits of lqn and c q n are determined and in section 8 the cluster algebras of an 1 and p 1 n 1 are presented as factors by poisson ideals generated by a poisson central element of polynomial algebras with appropriate poisson brackets 4 christopher d fish and david a jordan 2 connected quantized weyl algebras throughout k will denote an algebraically closed field and q k we make a fixed choice of one of the square roots of q in k and denote it by q 1 2 notation 2 1 the co ordinate ring of the quantum plane rq is the k algebra generated by x and y subject to the relation xy qyx there is symmetry up to the transposition of q and q 1 as the relation can be rewritten yx q 1 xy it is well known that rq is the skew polynomial ring k y x q where q is the k automorphism of k y such that q y qy as such it has a pbw basis yixj i j 0 by symmetry rq k x y q 1 where q 1 is the k automorphism of k x such that q 1 x q 1 x and has a pbw basis xiyj i j 0 by the first quantized weyl algebra a q 1 k we mean the k algebra generated by x and y subject to the relation xy qyx 1 q with q and q 1 as in the above discussion of the quantum plane a q 1 k has presentations as the skew polynomial ring k y x q where y 1 q and as the skew polynomial ring k x y q 1 where y 1 q 1 as such it has pbw bases yixj i j 0 and xiyj i j 0 remark 2 2 the reader may be more familiar with the relation xy qyx 1 here unless q 1 the two give isomorphic algebras indeed if r k and xy qyx 1 and x rx then x y qyx r so by changing generators the right hand side of the relation xy qyx 1 can be replaced by any non zero scalar r there are two advantages in choosing 1 q in this role the first is that the relation xy qyx 1 q can be rewritten yx q 1 xy 1 q 1 giving symmetry up to the transposition of q and q 1 the second is that setting q 1 yields the commutative algebra k x y giving rise to a poisson bracket on k x y with x y xy 1 this poisson bracket arises from the quantization procedure outlined in 4 iii 5 4 with a k y q 1 x and h q 1 where is the k automorphism of k y q 1 such that y qy and q q and is the derivation of k y such that y 1 q and q 0 whence q and h are central xy qyx 1 q xy yx h xy 1 a ha k x y and if q 6 1 a q q a a q 1 k loosely speaking a connected quantized weyl algebra is a finitely generated k algebra with a pbw basis in which any two generators satisfy a quantum plane relation or a quantized weyl relation and there are sufficiently many of the latter the formal definition is as follows definition 2 3 by a connected quantized weyl algebra over k we shall mean a k algebra with generators x 1 x 2 xn n 2 satisfying the following properties i there are scalars qij k and rij k 1 i 6 j n with each qji q 1 ij and each rji q 1 ij rij such that the relation xixj qijxjxi rij holds ii the standard monomials xa 11 x a 2 2 x an n form a pbw basis for r iii the graph with vertices x 1 x 2 xn in which there is an edge between xi and xj if and only if rij 6 0 is connected connected quantized weyl algebras and quantum cluster algebras 5 remark 2 4 the conditions on qji and rji ensure that the relations xixj qijxjxi rij and xjxi qjixixj rji are equivalent the relations xixj qijxjxi rij ensure that the standard monomials xa 11 x a 2 2 x an n span r the pbw condition therefore ensures that the relations xixj qijxjxi rij form a complete set of defining relations for r when n 2 up to isomorphism the quantized weyl algebra a q i is the only connected quantized weyl algebra over k we can take q 12 q and r 12 1 q or if q 1 r 12 1 remark 2 5 we can orientate and label the graph in the definition to carry more informa tion as shown in figure 1 we orientate an edge representing a relation xixj qijxjxi rij with rij 6 0 from xi to xj with label qij or from xj to xi with label qji but not both xjxi qij figure 1 orientation of edges example 2 6 let n 1 and let q k 1 let lqn denote the k algebra generated by x 1 x 2 xn subject to the relations xixi 1 qxi 1 xi 1 q 1 6 i 6 n 1 6 xixj qxjxi 0 i 1 i 1 j 6 n j i odd 7 xixj q 1 xjxi 0 i 1 i 1 j 6 n j i even 8 in particular l q 1 k x 1 and l q 2 a q 1 using 9 proposition 1 one can show inductively that for n 2 lqn is the skew polynomial ring l q n 1 xn n n for a k automorphism n and a n derivation n of l q n 1 such that n xj q 1 n jxj 1 6 j 6 n 1 n xj 0 1 6 j 6 n 2 n xn 1 1 q 1 informally it suffices to show that n and n respect the defining relations of l q n 1 more formally one can write l q n 1 as a factor f i of the free algebra over k on n 1 generators and show that n and n are induced by an appropriate automorphism n and n derivation n of f such that n i i and n i i x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 q q q q figure 2 l q 5 as lqn is an iterated skew polynomial ring over k it has a pbw basis x a 1 1 x a 2 2 x an n a 1 a 2 an n n 0 where n 0 n 0 provided n 2 l q n clearly satisfies the other 6 christopher d fish and david a jordan conditions for a connected quantized weyl algebra the relevant graph for the presentation in 6 8 being the path graph pn and we may refer to it as the linear connected quantized weyl algebra lqn figure 2 shows the graph for l q 5 as presented in 6 8 in the next example the two ends of the graph are joined up and each vertex is linked to two others resulting in the cycle graph or n gon cn example 2 7 let n 1 be odd and let q k let cqn denote the k algebra generated by x 1 x 2 xn subject to the relations xixi 1 qxi 1 xi 1 q 1 6 i 6 n 1 9 xnx 1 qx 1 xn 1 q 10 xixj qxjxi 0 i 1 i 1 j 6 n j i odd 11 xixj q 1 xjxi 0 i 1 i 1 j n j i even 12 in comparison with the odd case of lqn the relation x 1 xn q 1 xnx 1 0 is replaced by the quantized weyl relation xnx 1 qx 1 xn 1 q as in example 2 6 one can show that c q n is the skew polynomial ring l q n 1 xn n n for the same k automorphism n of l q n 1 as for l q n and the n derivation n of l q n 1 such that n x 1 1 q n xj 0 2 6 j 6 n 2 n xn 1 1 q 1 as for lqn the algebra c q n satisfies the conditions for a connected quantized weyl algebra the relevant graph for the presentation in 9 12 being the cycle graph cn we may refer to it as the cyclic connected quantized weyl algebra cqn figure 3 shows the graph for c q 5 as presented in 9 12 x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 qq q q q figure 3 c q 5 remark 2 8 cyclic connected quantized weyl algebras with n 3 are related to the quantized enveloping algebra uq sl 2 provided q 6 1 localization of c q 2 3 at x i 1 i 1 which is a right and left ore set by 14 lemma 1 4 gives uq sl 2 in the equitable presentation 21 connected quantized weyl algebras and quantum cluster algebras 7 example 2 9 for a k algebra r satisfying i and ii of definition 2 3 neither the graph in iii nor its connectedness are invariants of the algebra for example consider the weyl algebra a 2 generated by x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 with relations xiyi yixi 1 i 1 2 and commutation relations for other pairs of generators the graph for these generators has two connected components each with two vertices and a single edge however taking x 1 y 1 x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 as generators gives a square and taking x 1 y 1 x 1 x 2 y 2 gives the path graph p 4 thus a 2 is a connected quantized weyl algebra although this is not apparent from its usual presentation a similar situation exists for higher weyl algebras an n 3 with an increasing variety of possible graphs for different sets of generators for example a 3 has the hexagonal graph c 6 for the generators x 1 y 1 x 1 x 2 y 2 x 2 x 3 y 1 y 3 the path graph p 6 for x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x 2 x 3 y 1 y 3 and the complete bipartite graph k 3 3 for x 1 x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 x 3 y 1 y 1 y 2 y 1 y 2 y 3 whenever we refer to the graph for lqn or c q n we shall mean the graph for the presentation in 6 8 or 9 12 as appropriate example 2 10 consider the k algebra r generated by x 1 x 2 and x 3 subject to the relations x 1 x 2 x 2 x 1 1 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 2 1 x 3 x 1 x 1 x 3 1 this can be obtained from c q 3 by first changing generators to replace the scalar terms 1 q in the relations by 1 and then setting q 1 writing x y and z for x 1 x 2 and x 3 respectively r is a skew polynomial ring a 1 z where is the derivation of the first weyl algebra a 1 with x 1 and y 1 as such it is a connected quantized weyl algebra with the same graph as c q 3 all derivations of a 1 are known to be inner 8 lemma 4 6 8 and is the inner derivation induced by x y setting t x y z which is central r is a polynomial ring a 1 t relative to the generators x y t the graph is not connected having connected components x y and t a similar construction reveals the polynomial algebra ak t over the kth weyl algebra ak to be a connected quantized weyl algebra with the same cyclic graph as c q 2 k 1 we shall see that the algebra c q 2 k 1 of example 2 7 has a distinguished central element which loosely speaking quantizes t so that the quotient c q 2 k 1 c q 2 k 1 quantizes ak the next result tells us that for an algebra r satisfying condition i of definition 2 3 condition ii is independent of the ordering of the generators and that every algebra satis fying both is an iterated skew polynomial extension of k lemma 2 11 let n 2 and for 1 i 6 j 6 n let qij k and rij k be such that for i 6 j qji q 1 ij and rji q 1 ij rij let r be the k algebra generated by x 1 x 2 xn subject to the n n 1 2 relations xjxi qijxixj rij 1 6 i j 6 n 13 the following are equivalent 8 christopher d fish and david a jordan i the standard monomials xa 11 x a 2 2 x an n form a k basis for r ii whenever i j k are distinct rij 6 0 implies qik qkj q 1 jk iii r is an iterated skew polynomial algebra over k in x 1 x 2 xn iv for any permutation sn the standard monomials x a 1 1 xa 2 2 xan n form a k basis for r v for any permutation sn r is an iterated skew polynomial algebra over k in x 1 x 2 x n proof as ii is invariant under permutation and iv and v are obtained from i and iii respectively by permutation it suffices to prove the equivalence of i ii and iii i ii suppose that xa 11 x a 2 2 x an n is a k basis for r and let 1 u v w n the element xwxvxu can be written in terms of this basis by computing either xwxv xu or xw xvxu equating the resulting two expressions and cancelling the term in xuxvxw that appears in both gives qvwquwruvxw qvwruwxv rvwxu ruvxw quvruwxv quvquwrvwxu if ruv 6 0 or equivalently rvu 6 0 then comparing coefficents of xw gives qvw qwu if ruw 6 0 or equivalently rwu 6 0 then comparing coefficents of xv gives qvw quv if rvw 6 0 or equivalently rwv 6 0 then comparing coefficents of xu gives quv qwu this covers all six possibilities for the relative order of i j k where i j k u v w in ii ii iii suppose that ii holds for 1 6 m 6 n let rm be the subalgebra of r generated by x 1 x 2 xm let i j k consider the relation xjxi qijxixj rij and let x i qikxi and x j qjkxj then x jx i qijx ix j rij this is trivial if rij 0 and follows from ii otherwise this gives rise inductively to a k automorphism k of rk 1 with k xi qikxi for 1 i k to see that there is a k derivation k of rk 1 with k xi rik for 1 i k we need to check that rjkxi xj rik qijrikxj qij xi rjk 0 that is rjk 1 qijqik xi rik qjk qij xj 0 which is immediate from ii using 9 proposition 1 it now follows inductively that rk rk 1 xk k k and hence that r is an iterated skew polynomial algebra in x 1 x 2 xn over k iii i this is immediate from the fact that as a left r module any skew polynomial ring r x is free as a left r module with basis 1 x x 2 corollary 2 12 let r be a connected quantized weyl algebra generated by x 1 x 2 xn with parameters qij and rij there exists q k such that qij 1 i 6 j n q q 1 connected quantized weyl algebras and quantum cluster algebras 9 proof as r is connected and every finite connected graph has a spanning tree we can renum ber the generators so that for 1 m n the subgraph corresponding to the subalgebra rm generated by x 1 xm is connected by lemma 2 11 rm is a connected quantized weyl al gebra for m 2 for 2 m n let qm qij 1 i 6 j m then q 2 q q 1 where q q 12 let 2 m n suppose that qm q q 1 and let i m 1 there exist j k such that 1 k j m rij 6 0 and rjk 6 0 by lemma 2 11 ii qij qki qjk q q 1 and qi q j q q 1 for all 1 2 m j it follows that qm 1 q q 1 and by induction that qn q q 1 as required corollary 2 13 let r be a connected quantized weyl algebra generated by x 1 x 2 xn with single parameter q as in corollary 2 12 suppose that q 6 1 if rij 6 0 and rjk 6 0 then rj 0 for 1 2 n i j k in other words in the graph associated with the given presentation of r the maximum degree of a vertex cannot exceed two proof suppose that rij 6 0 rjk 6 0 and rj 6 0 without loss of generality assume that qij q by lemma 2 11 ii applied to i j and either or k qj qjk q whereas by lemma 2 11 ii applied to k j and qj qkj q 1 as q 6 1 this is a contradiction the next result is readily checked from the defining relations for lqn and c q n proposition 2 14 let n 1 and let q k 1 i let k there is a k automorphism of l q n such that xi 1 ixi for 1 i n ii if n is odd then there is a k automorphism of of cqn such that xi xi for 1 i n iii there is an injective k homomorphism l q n 1 l q n such that xi xi 1 for 1 i n 1 iv if n is odd then there is a k automorphism of cqn such that xi xi 1 for 1 i n where subscripts are interpreted modulo n in 1 2 n v there is a k isomorphism from lqn to l q 1 n such that xi 7 xn i 1 for 1 i n vi if n is odd then there is a k isomorphism from cqn to c q 1 n such that xi 7 xn i 1 for 1 i n remark 2 15 when n is odd and j n then l q j 1 and l q j are subalgebras of c q n and the injective k homomorphism l q j 1 l q j in proposition 2 14 iii is the restriction to l q j 1 of the automorphism of cqn in proposition 2 14 iv proposition 2 16 let n 2 and let r be a connected quantized weyl algebra generated by x 1 x 2 xn with single parameter q as in corollary 2 12 suppose that q 6 1 then r lqn or r c q n proof as in the proof of corollary 2 12 we can renumber the generators so that for 2 i n the algebra ri generated by x 1 xi is a connected quantized weyl algebra in view of proposition 2 14 v vi we can assume that q 12 q we shall show by induction on n that there exist 1 n k such that if x i ixi then when the defining relations of r 10 christopher d fish and david a jordan are written in terms of the generators x i they become those of l q n or c q n this is true when n 2 take 1 1 and 2 1 q r 1 12 by induction we may assume that rn 1 has a presentation for which the graph is the same as for l q n 1 or if n is even c q n 1 and that for 1 i j n 1 qij q 1 j i 1 and for 1 i n 2 ri i 1 1 q all vertices in the graph for c q n 1 and vertices x 2 xn 1 in the graph representing l q n 1 have vertex degree 2 so by corollary 2 13 and as r is connected the graph for rn 1 must be the same as for l q n 1 rin 0 for 1 i n 1 and rn 1 6 0 or rn 1 n 6 0 or both first suppose that r n 1 n 6 0 as r n 1 n 6 0 it follows from lemma 2 11 ii that for 1 i n qin q 1 i n 1 q 1 n i 1 thus qij q 1 j i 1 for 1 i j n now suppose also that rn 1 0 let x i xi for 1 i n 1 and let x n 1 q r 1 n 1 n xn then x i x n generate r subject to the q commutation relations x ix j q 1 j i 1 xjxi i j 1 and the quantized weyl relations x ix i 1 qx i 1 x i 1 q 1 i n 1 thus r lqn similar calculations with the generators ordered as xn x 1 xn 1 give the same conclusion when rn 1 6 0 and r n 1 n 0 it remains to consider the case where r 1 n 6 0 6 r n 1 n in this case by lemma 2 11 ii q q 12 q 2 n q 1 n 1 so as q 6 1 n must be odd the same change of generators as above gives the same relations between the x i but with the q commutation relation between x 1 and x n replaced by x nx 1 qx 1 x n 1 q where r 1 n 1 n rn 1 let k be such that 2 1 and let x i 1 i 1 x i for 1 i n then x 1 x n generate r subject to the q commutation relations x i x j q 1 j i 1 x jx i when i j 1 unless i 1 and j n and the quantized weyl relations x i x i 1 qx i 1 x i 1 1 q 1 q 1 i n 1 and x nx 1 qx 1 x n 2 1 q 1 q thus r cqn in this case remark 2 17 proposition 2 16 is false when q 1 if q 1 and qij is always q when i 6 j then by lemma 2 11 one can take any connected graph g on x 1 x 2 xn and construct a connected quantized weyl algebra using the relations xixj qxjxi rij 1 i j n where rij 1 if there is an edge between xi and xj in g and rij 0 if there is no such edge in 6 the authors consider the k algebra wn constructed in this way when q 1 and g is the complete graph many ring theoretic properties of cqn and l q n follow from the fact that they are iterated skew polynomial extensions of the field k connected quantized weyl algebras and quantum cluster algebras 11 proposition 2 18 i the connected quantized weyl algebras cqn and l q n are right and left noetherian domains with k as their group of units ii if m is a simple module over either cqn or l q n then endm k if r is a prime factor ring of either cqn or l q n for which the centre z r of r is not k then r is not primitive iii if r is a prime factor of either cqn or l q n then the jacobson radical jac r 0 if further the intersection of the non zero prime ideals of r is non zero then r is primitive proof i cqn and l q n are right and left noetherian domains by repeated application of 28 theorem 1 2 9 iv and i or 18 theorem 2 6 and exercise 2 o although explicit references are elusive it is well known and easy to see using degree that for a skew polynomial ring r x over a ring r with an automorphism and derivation u r x u r hence u cqn k u lqn ii and iii by 28 example 1 6 11 cqn and l q n are constructible k algebras in the sense of 28 9 4 12 so by 28 theorem 9 4 21 they satisfy the nullstellensatz over k as stated in 28 9 1 4 thus every factor ring has nil jacobson radical and for any simple module m endm is algebraic over k here k is algebraically closed so endm k if z r 6 k and z r k then multiplication by induces an endomorphism of any simple module m as endm k m is annihilated by for some k whence r cannot be primitive as r is noetherian and prime the nil ideal jac r is nilpotent and hence 0 if the intersection of the non zero prime ideals of r is non zero then as jac r 0 the ideal 0 must be primitive proposition 2 19 if q is not a root of unity then every prime ideal of lqn is completely prime proof this is a consequence of 16 theorem 2 3 conditions a and b of that result are clearly satisfied condition c holds because in example 2 6 i i xj 0 i i xj for 1 j i 1 and i i xi 1 1 q 1 q i i xi 1 both d and the supplementary condition on the group which here is q hold because q is not a root of unity remark 2 20 we shall see that the analogue of proposition 2 19 for cqn is false the conditions of 16 theorem 2 3 break down in a rather minimal way when the final generator xn is adjoined condition c fails because n n xj 0 n n xj for 1 j n 1 and n n xn 1 1 q 1 q n n xn 1 whereas n n x 1 1 q q 1 n n x 1 3 prime spectrum of lqn the purpose of this section is to determine the prime spectrum of the linear connected quantized weyl algebras lqn n 3 it is well known for example 14 8 4 and 8 5 or 24 example 6 3 iii that the quantized weyl algebra a q 1 has a distinguished normal element z such that if q is not a root of unity the localization of a q 1 at the powers of z is simple with a q 1 as in 2 1 z x 1 x 2 1 q x 2 x 1 1 we shall identify a sequence of elements zi 1 i n such that for 1 i n zi is normal in l q i notation 3 1 let n 3 in lqn let z 1 0 z 0 1 and for 1 i n let zi zi 1 xi zi 2 12 christopher d fish and david a jordan the next lemma gives an alternative expression for zi in terms of the k homomorphism l q n 1 l q n of proposition 2 14 iii for which 2 l q n 2 l q n lemma 3 2 for 1 i n zi x 1 zi 1 2 zi 2 proof the proof is by induction on i when i 1 x 1 z 0 2 z 1 x 1 z 1 and when i 2 x 1 z 1 2 z 0 x 1 x 2 1 z 2 if i 2 and the result holds for i 1 and i 2 then zi zi 1 xi zi 2 x 1 zi 2 xi 2 zi 3 xi x 1 zi 3 2 zi 4 x 1 zi 2 xi 1 zi 3 2 zi 3 xi 2 zi 4 x 1 zi 1 2 zi 2 we now seek relations between xi and zj for 1 i j n and between zi and zj when i 6 j lemma 3 3 let 1 i j n then xizj q 1 i 1 zjxi if j is odd and j i 1 zjxi if j is even and j i 1 zi 1 xi q 1 zi 2 if i is odd and j i 1 q 1 zi 1 xi 1 q 1 zi 2 if i is even and j i 1 zjxi if j is odd and j i q 1 i 1 zjxi if j is even and j i proof this is a straightforward induction on j using the defining relations and the equations zk zk 1 xk zk 2 and applying the previous two cases at each inductive step the trivial case j 0 where zj 1 can be used along with the case j 1 in the initial step separate calculations are needed for the cases j i 2 j i 1 j i j i 1 and j i 2 we give details for the cases j i 1 j i and j i 1 when j is even the odd cases of these are similar and the cases j i 2 and j i 2 are routine suppose that j is even and that the result holds for j 1 and j 2 if j i 1 then xizi 1 xizi 2 xi 1 xizi 3 zi 2 xi 1 xi 1 q zi 3 xi zi 1 xi 1 q zi 2 if j i then xizi xizi 1 xi xizi 2 q 1 zi 1 x 2 i 1 q 1 zi 2 xi zi 2 xi q 1 zixi connected quantized weyl algebras and quantum cluster algebras 13 and if j i 1 then xizi 1 xizixi 1 xizi 1 qzi xi 1 xi 1 q zi 1 xi 1 q zi

odd q 1 zi 1 xi 1 q 1 zi 2 if i is even the result follows by using the equation zi 2 zi 1 xi zi to substitute for zi 2 on the right hand side corollary 3 5 i for 1 i n znxi ixizn where i 1 if n is odd and i q 1 i if n is even consequently the element zn is normal in l q n ii for 0 i j n zizj q ijzjzi where ij 0 if j is odd or if j and i are both even and ij 1 if j is even and i is odd proof i is immediate from lemma 3 3 and ii follows inductively using the formula zi zi 1 xi zi 2 notation 3 6 let n 2 let q k let ij be the n n antisymmetric matrix over k such that for 1 i j n ij is as specified in lemma 3 5 ii and for 1 i j n let qij q ij thus qji q 1 ij qii 1 and for i j qij 1 if j is odd or if j and i are both even and qij q if j is even and i is odd let w qn and t q n respectively denote the co ordinate ring of quantum n space with genera tors z 1 zn and the co ordinate ring of the quantum n torus with generators z 1 1 z 1 n subject to the relations zizj qijzjzi for 1 i j n we may also refer occasionally to the subalgebras w q i and t q i generated by z 1 z 2 zi or by z 1 1 z 1 2 z 1 i as appropriate where 1 i n as is well known w qn is an iterated skew polynomial algebra over k and t qn is an iterated skew laurent polynomial algebra over k lemma 3 7 suppose that q is not a root of unity if n is even then t qn is simple and if n is odd then t qn is a laurent polynomial ring t q n 1 z 1 n over the simple ring t q n 1 proof if n is even we apply the criterion given by 27 proposition 1 3 let m 1 mn z be such that qm 11 j q m 2 2 j q mn nj 1 for all j 1 j n if j is even then qij 1 unless i is odd and i j in which case qij q so successive considerations of the cases j 2 4 n 14 christopher d fish and david a jordan gives m 2 m 4 mn 0 if j is odd then qij 1 unless i is even and i j in which case qij q 1 successive considerations of the cases j n 1 3 1 gives mn 1 m 3 m 1 0 by 27 proposition 1 3 t q n is simple if n is odd then it is clear from corollary 3 5 ii that t qn t q n 1 z 1 n the following result of wexler kreindler 31 proposition 2 on changing the indeterminate of a skew polynomial ring will be useful lemma 3 8 let be an automorphism of a ring r and let be an derivation of r let a r and let u be a unit in r with inner automorphism u r 7 uru 1 let u and for r r let r u r ar u r a then is an derivation of r and r x r x where x ux a the next result allows us to identify lqn with an intermediate k algebra between w q n and t qn after the proof of i this identification which is pre empted by the use of the notation zi in all three algebras will be made implicitly notation 3 9 for 1 j n let zj denote the multiplicatively closed set fz a 1 1 z a 2 2 z aj j f k ai n 0 1 i j of w q n we will make use of the fact that each zn is right and left ore and that t qn is the localization of w q n at zn proposition 3 10 let n 2 and q k suppose that q is not a root of unity i there are injective k algebra homomorphisms w qn l q n and l q n t q n such that zi zi for 1 i n this allows us to regard w q n as a subalgebra of l q n and to regard each zj as a subset of l q n ii the sets zn and zn 1 are right and left ore sets in l q n the localization of l q n at zn is t qn if n is odd then the localization of l q n at zn 1 is the polynomial algebra t q n 1 zn and if n is even it is the skew polynomial algebra t q n 1 zn where zi zi if i is even and zi q 1 zi if i is odd proof i by corollary 3 5 ii applied to each of the algebras l q i there is a k algebra homomorphism w qn l q n such that zi zi for 1 i n as l q n is a domain so also is the image w qn hence ker is a completely prime ideal of w q n if ker 6 0 then by lemma 3 7 either zi ker for some i 1 i n 1 or zn ker for some k with 0 if n is even as lqn has a pbw basis and the coefficient of x 1 x 2 xi in zi is 1 it follows that ker 0 and hence that is injective with z 1 0 and z 0 1 let wi z 1 i 1 zi and vi wi w 1 i 1 z 1 i 1 zi zi 2 t q n 1 i n it follows by corollary 3 5 ii that for 1 i j n wjwi q 1 wiwj if i j is even qwjwi if i j is odd from this it follows routinely that if i j 1 then vjvi q 1 vjvi if i j is even qvjvi if i j is odd connected quantized weyl algebras and quantum cluster algebras 15 and that vi 1 vi qvivi 1 1 q thus the vi s satisfy the defining relations for l q n and there is a k algebra homomorphism lqn t q n such that xi vi and zi zi for 1 i n as t q n is a domain so also is lqn so ker is a completely prime ideal of l q n let d r lqn zr w q n for some z zn 1 using corollary 3 5 ii it is easy to see that d is a subalgebra of lqn for 1 i n zi 1 xi zi zi 2 so each xi d and therefore lqn d now suppose that ker 6 0 and let 0 6 f ker as f d there exists z zn 1 such that zf ker w q n as zi zi for all i ker w q n 0 so zf 0 but lqn is a domain so f 0 hence ker 0 and is injective ii as t qn is a right and left quotient ring of w q n with respect to zn it is also a right and left quotient ring of the intermediate ring lqn with respect to zn and hence zn is right and left ore in lqn the set zn 1 is a n invariant right and left ore set in l q n 1 with quotient ring t q n 1 so it follows easily from 14 lemma 1 4 that it is right and left ore in l q n with quotient ring t q n 1 xn n n as zn zn 1 xn zn 2 and zn 1 is invertible in t q n 1 it follows from lemma 3 8 that if n is odd then t q n 1 xn n n t q n 1 zn and that if n is even it is the skew polynomial algebra t q n 1 xn n n t q n 1 zn where zi zi if i is even and zi q 1 zi if i is odd notation 3 11 for m n and q k let m q 1 q q 2 qm 1 which if q 6 1 is qm 1 q 1 proposition 3 12 let n 2 and let z fza 11 z a 2 2 z an 1 n 1 zn 1 where f k and ai n 0 for 1 i n 1 let l l q n and suppose that q is not a root of unity then lzl l and p zn 1 for all prime ideals p of l proof suppose that lzl 6 l and let m be a maximal ideal of l containing lzl by proposition 2 19 m is completely prime and so zi m for some i 1 i n 1 by lemma 3 3 zj m for 0 j i 1 in particular 1 z 0 m which is impossible hence lzl l and consequently p zn 1 for all prime ideals p of l we are now in a position to determine the prime ideals of lqn when q is not a root of unity theorem 3 13 let l lqn and suppose that q is not a root of unity if n is odd then the prime ideals of l are 0 and for each k p zn l if n is even then the prime ideals of l are 0 znl and for each k p zn 1 l znl proof first note that if n is odd then p is an ideal of l as zn is central if n is even then znl is an ideal of l by corollary 3 5 i and zn 1 is central modulo znl q n in l q n by corollary 3 4 so p is an ideal of l for k note that zn zn 1 xn zn 2 has degree one in xn using 22 proposition 1 and corollary 3 5 it is easily shown by induction that zn l is completely prime if n is odd or if n is even and 0 if 6 0 xn 1 zn 2 mod p so l p is generated by the images xi 1 i n 1 and there are inverse homomorphisms l p l q n 1 zn 1 l q n 1 and l q n 1 zn 1 l q n 1 l p such that xi xi 16 christopher d fish and david a jordan and xi xi for 1 i n 1 thus l p l q n 1 zn 1 l q n 1 and hence p is also completely prime let t be the localization of l at zn 1 and let p be a non zero prime ideal of l suppose that n is odd by proposition 3 10 and lemma 3 7 t is the polynomial ring t q n 1 zn t q n 1 k k zn over the simple ring t q n 1 by 27 proposition 1 3 the centre of t q n 1 is k it is then a consequence of 28 lemma 9 6 9 i that pt p t for some k by proposition 3 12 and 28 proposition 2 1 16 vii p p now suppose that n is even by proposition 3 10 and lemma 3 7 t is a skew polynomial ring t q n 1 zn and t q n 1 z 1 n is simple it follows that pt contains zn and hence has the form q znt for some prime ideal q of t q n 1 t q n 2 z 1 n 1 by 28 lemma 9 6 9 i every such prime ideal of t q n 1 has the form 0 or zn 1 t q n 1 for some k so pt znt or pt p t the result in the even case now follows as in the odd case using 28 proposition 2 16 vii and proposition 3 12 recall from 7 that a noetherian domain r is called a unique factorization domain ufd if every non zero prime ideal of r contains a non zero completely prime ideal of the form pr where p is normal in r the following is immediate from theorem 3 13 corollary 3 14 suppose that q is not a root of unity if n 2 then the linear connected quantized weyl algebra lqn is a ufd if n is odd then every height one prime ideal of l q n is maximal if n is even then there is a unique height one prime ideal znl q n and l q n znl q n is a ufd in which every height one prime ideal is maximal corollary 3 15 let l lqn and suppose that q is not a root of unity if n is odd then the primitive ideals of l are the prime ideals zn l k if n is even then the primitive ideals of l are 0 and for each k zn 1 l znl proof suppose that n is odd the ideal 0 of l is not primitive by proposition 2 18 ii due to the existence of the central element zn all the non zero prime ideals are maximal and hence primitive now suppose that n is even the ideal 0 of l is primitive by proposition 2 18 iii because l has a unique height one prime ideal the ideal znl is not primitive by proposition 2 18 ii as zn 1 is central modulo znl the remaining prime ideals are maximal and hence primitive 4 prime spectrum of cqn throughout this section n 3 is an odd positive integer recall that the cyclic connected quantized weyl algebra cqn has the form l q n 1 xn n n and contains l q m as a subalgebra for 1 m n 1 let be the k automorphism of cqn specified in proposition 2 14 iii thus xi xi 1 for 1 i n 1 and xn x 1 for 1 m n l q m is the k subalgebra of cqn generated by x 2 x 3 xm 1 the relations that the elements z 1 z 2 zn 1 c q n satisfy with each other and with x 1 x 2 xn 1 are as in lemma 3 3 and corollaries 3 4 and 3 5 the next lemma gives the relations between xn and each of z 1 z 2 zn 1 in connected quantized weyl algebras and quantum cluster algebras 17 cqn and by modifying the formula that defined zn in l q n identifies a distinguished central element of cqn lemma 4 1 let zn 1 xn zn 2 q zn 2 c q n and let be the k automorphism of cqn specified in proposition 2 14 iii i for 1 j n 2 xnzj qzjxn 1 q zj 1 if j is odd zjxn

derivation n of l q n 1 such that n x 1 1 q n xj 0 for 2 j n 2 and n xn 1 1 q 1 for i let 1 j n 2 it is a routine matter to check by induction that n zj qzj if j is odd and n zj zj if j is even and that n zj n zj 1 xj zj 2 1 q zj 1 the result i follows using i we see that n zn 1 n zn 2 xn 1 zn 3 zn 1 and that n zn 1 n zn 2 xn 1 zn 3 1 q zn 3 xn 2 1 q 1 qzn 2 1 q zn 4 1 q zn 2 zn 2 thus ii holds

of unity the subsets zn 1 and zn 2 of l q n 1 are right and left ore sets in c q n the localization of c q n at zn 1 is the polynomial ring t q n 1 over the simple algebra t q n 1 proof by proposition 3 10 zn 1 is a right and left ore set in l q n 1 and it is clearly n invariant by 14 lemma 1 4 zn 1 is right and left ore in c q n with quotient ring t q n 1 xn n n similarly zn 2 is a right and left ore set in l q n 1 and in c q n as uxn a where u zn 1 which is invertible in t q n 1 and a zn 2 q zn 2 l q n 1 it follows from lemma 3 8 that t q n 1 xn n n has the form t q n 1 n n as is central n must be the identity automorphism on l q n 1 and n must be the zero derivation the next lemma will be significant in identifying the localization of cqn at zn 2 as an ambiskew polynomial ring our notation for such rings and the related generalized weyl algebras will be essentially as in 24 given a k algebra a commuting k automorphisms and of a an element v a such that va a v for all a a and v v and a scalar k 0 the ambiskew polynomial ring r r a v is the iterated skew polynomial ring a y x where 1 is extended to a k automorphism of a y by setting y y and is a derivation of a y such that a 0 and y v thus xy yx v and for all a a ya a y and xa a x if v is regular as will be the case in all examples considered here then v determines if there exists u a such that ua a u for all a a and v u u then the element z xy u yx u is such that zy yz zx 1 xz za a z for all a a and zu uz if such an element u exists then r is a conformal ambiskew polynomial ring u is a splitting element and z which is normal in r is the corresponding casimir element of r the factor r zr which we denote here by w a u is then generated by a x x zr and y y zr subject to the relations xy u y x u and for all a a y a a y and xa a x in the case where u is central this is one of the algebras named generalized weyl algebras in 1 and we use the same name here lemma 4 3 for q k and 1 i n 1 qzi zi 2 zi 1 zi 1 q i 1 2 if

let q k suppose that q is not a root of unity let be the k automorphism of t q n 2 such that for 1 i n 2 zi zi if i is even and zi q 1 zi if i is odd i the localization s of cqn at zn 2 is the ambiskew polynomial algebra r t q n 2 v 1 where v 1 q q n 3 2 z 1 n 2 zn 2 x 1 zn 1 and y z 1 n 2 zn 1 ii for any k the element q n 3 2 z 1 n 2 qzn 2 is splitting is a central casimir element and s s is a generalized weyl algebra over t q n 2 proof i by 14 lemma 1 4 t q n 2 xn 1 n 1 n 1 xn n n is the localization of c q n at zn 2 observe that y xn 1 z 1 n 2 zn 3 and that by lemma 3 2 x 1 zn 1 xnzn 2 zn 3 qzn 2 xn 1 q zn 3 zn 3 by 4 1 i q zn 2 xn zn 3 as qzn 2 is a unit in t q n 2 it follows from lemma 3 8 that s is an iterated skew polynomial ring of the form t q n 2 y n 1 n 1 x n n over t q n 2 by corollary 3 5 yxi q 1 ixiy for 1 i n 2 and it follows that n 1 and n 1 0 also by corollary 3 5 zn 1 xi 1 q 1 i 1 xi 1 zn 1 for 1 i n 2 applying 1 we see that xxi q 1 i 1 xix for 1 i n 2 and hence that the restrictions of n and n to t q n 2 are 1 and 0 respectively it remains to show that n y y and that n y v by lemma 4 1 i n zn 1 zn 1 and n zn 2 qzn 2 and by 3 5 qzn 2 zn 1 qzn 1 it follows by lemma 3 8 that n y y 20 christopher d fish and david a jordan we have seen that n t 0 for all t t q n 2 so n y n xn 1 z 1 n 2 zn 3 n xn 1 applying 1 to the equation in lemma 4 1 ii we obtain xxn 1 xn

central also u u q n 3 2 z 1 n 2 qzn 2 qq n 3 2 z 1 n 2 zn 2 q 1 zn 2 q n 3 2 z 1 n 2 v so u is a splitting element as zn 2 is central in l q n 2 the corresponding casimir element is z xy u 1 zn 1 xn

by lemma 4 3 with i n 2 zn 2 zn 2 zn 1 zn 3 q n 3 2 so applying 1 and postmultiplying by z 1 n 2 1 zn 2 1 zn 1 zn 3 z 1 n 2 q n 3 2 z 1 n 2 hence z is a casimir element and s s is a generalized weyl algebra over t q n 2 connected quantized weyl algebras and quantum cluster algebras 21 proposition 4 5 there is a bijection between speccqn and specs given by p 7 ps for p speccqn and q 7 q c q n for q specs proof for all z zn 2 l q n 1 zl q n 1 l q n 1 by proposition 3 12 and so c q nzc q n c q n hence p zn 2 for all p specc q n the result follows by 28 proposition 2 1 16 vii the ambiskew polynomial ring s is the main example of 10 where its prime spectrum is computed it consists of 0 a height one prime ideal s for each k for each positive integer m two maximal ideals fm 1 and fm 1 such that s fm 1 and s fm 1 have goldie rank m here fm 1 contains the height one prime ideal s where q m 1 q n 2 m 1 4 and fm 1 contains s also if m n are such that m 6 then q m 1 q n 2 m 1 4 6 q 1 q n 2 1 4 for details see 10 examples 2 8 and 3 12 and corollary 4 7 where p n 2 proposition 4 6 for all k the ideal cqn is a completely prime ideal of c q n proof as zn 1 l q n 1 is completely prime in l q n 1 and zn 2 q zn 2 zn 1 l q n 1 this follows on applying the last part of 22 proposition 1 to zn 1 xn zn 2 q zn 2 lemma 4 7 let r be a right and left noetherian ring with a right and left denominator set s and let p be a prime ideal such that p s then the elements of s are regular modulo p and their images in r p form a right and left ore set with right and left quotient ring rs prs proof let j r r rs p for some s s by a standard argument on the right ore condition j is an ideal of r as r is left noetherian j rj 1 rjn for some j 1 jn r such that jisi p for some s 1 sn s by 28 lemma 2 1 8 with r 1 rn 1 there exists s s such that each jis p and hence such that js p as j is an ideal containing the prime ideal p and s p it follows that j p by symmetry r r sr p for some s s p whence the elements of s are regular modulo p for the rest it is easy to check that s s p s s is a right and left ore set in r p and that rs prs is a right and left quotient ring of r p with respect to s theorem 4 8 suppose that q is not a root of unity the prime spectrum of cqn consists of 0 the height one prime ideals cqn k and for each positive integer m two height two prime ideals mm 1 and mm 1 for which the factors c q n mm 1 and c q n mm 1 have goldie rank m if 6 qm 1 q n 2 m 1 4 for all m n then cqn is maximal if q m 1 q n 2 m 1 4 then cqn mm 1 and c q n mm 1 proof it follows from proposition 4 5 the above specification of specs and 28 proposition 2 1 14 that the prime ideals of cqn are as listed lemma 4 7 ensures that 28 lemma 2 2 12 is applicable to show that s fm 1 and c q n fm 1 c q n have the same goldie rank m 22 christopher d fish and david a jordan corollary 4 9 suppose that q is not a root of unity if n 3 then the cyclic connected quantized weyl algebra cqn is a ufd in which all but countably many height one prime ideals are maximal corollary 4 10 suppose that q is not a root of unity the primitive spectrum of cqn consists of the non zero prime ideals listed in theorem 4 8 proof by proposition 2 18 ii the ideal 0 of cqn is not primitive due to the existence of the central element all other prime ideals of cqn are primitive for the non maximal height one prime ideals this is a consequence of proposition 2 18 iii and the fact that each of the non maximal height one prime ideals is strictly contained in a unique height two prime ideal fm 1 or fm 1 for an appropriate value of m 5 automorphisms in this section we determine the automorphism groups of the algebras lqn and c q n when q 6 1 we have already observed in proposition 2 14 the k automorphisms of l q n such that xi 1 ixi for 1 i n k and when n is odd the k automorphisms and of cqn such that xi xi and xi xi 1 for 1 i n where indices are interpreted modulo n clearly theorem 5 1 if n 3 is odd and q 6 1 then autk c q n is cyclic of order 2 n generated by proof we interpret the indices in the xi s modulo n as has odd order n and has order 2 the subgroup of autk c q n is cyclic of order 2 n generated by let autk c q n as must send height 1 primes to height 1 primes and u c q n k it follows from theorem 4 8 that for some k k as has total degree n and degree 1 in each xi there must be a permutation sn and scalars i k and i k such that for 1 i n xi ix i i for r s cqn let r s q rs qrs the possibilities for xk x q 1 k n are as follows if k 1 then xk x q 1 q if k 1 then xk x q 1 q 2 xkxk

so 1 q i i 1 x i x i 1 q thus x i x i 1 q k but as q 6 1 the only possibility is that i 1 i 1 hence each i i 1 1 and 1 2 3 n 1 1 also 11 n 1 n 1 n 2 12 1 so 1 1 and either i 1 for all i or i 1 for all i thus 1 1 or 1 1 whence and therefore autk c q n theorem 5 2 if n 2 and q 6 1 then the map k autk l q n given by 7 is a group isomorphism connected quantized weyl algebras and quantum cluster algebras 23 proof certainly is an injective homomorphism we proceed as in the proof of theorem 5 1 with zn which has total degree n and degree 1 in each xi replacing the height one primes have the form zn l q n with 0 if n is odd so if autk l q n then xi ix i i for some permutation sn and some scalars i k i k proceeding as in 5 1 we find that 1 q i i 1 x i x i 1 q but only for 1 i n 1 if 1 k n 1 then xn xk q k 0 as q 6 1 so i 6 n for 1 i n 1 hence n n and it follows successively that n 1 n 1 1 1 so is the identity permutation although unlike the cyclic case it is not necessary that n 1 1 we do have i i 1 1 for 1 i n 1 and so where 1 1 thus is an isomorphism 6 quantum cluster algebras in this section we present two classes of quantum cluster algebras in terms related to the connected quantized weyl algebras lqn and c q n when n is odd we shall not give a full account of the theory of quantum cluster algebras helpful references include 3 where the theory was first developed 20 and although we will not exploit its multiparameter aspect 19 the quantum cluster algebras that we consider here will have no frozen variables in published definitions of uniparameter quantum cluster algebras the base ring may be the ring z q 1 2 for an indeterminate q as in 3 or a field which may be either q q 1 2 with q as before as in 20 or more generally an arbitrary field k with a distinguished element q that has a square root in k and is not a root of unity as in 19 we shall take the last of these approaches let n 3 be odd consider the dynkin quiver n 1 of type an 1 oriented as shown 1 2 3 n 2 n 1 it is known that all quivers with the dynkin diagram of type an 1 as underlying graph are mutation equivalent see 13 lemma 3 23 the adjacency matrix is b bij where for 1 i j n 1 bij 1 if j i 1 and bij 0 if j 6 i 1 the inverse of b t is the skew symmetric n 1 n 1 integer matrix ij where as in corollary 3 5 ij 0 if j is odd or if j and i are both even and ij 1 if j is even and i is odd hence there is a quantum cluster algebra a q n 1 on an 1 and with each zjzi q ijzizj n 1 z 1 z 2 zn 1 is an initial seed where z 1 zn 1 are as in notation 3 6 it will be convenient to amend the quantum cluster z 1 z 2 zn 1 to y 1 y 2 yn 1 where yi q 1 i 4 zi if i is odd and yi q i 4 zi if i is even by the laurent phenomenon 3 corollary 5 2 a q n is a k subalgebra of t q n 1 k y 1 1 y 1 n

1 and proposition 2 18 i while simplicity is immediate from proposition 6 1 and theorem 3 13 remark 6 3 it can be deduced either from theorem 6 1 or directly using a similar proof that lqn is the quantum cluster algebra of n if the vertex n is frozen we continue to fix an odd integer n 3 and a scalar q k that is not a root of unity we now aim to explain the connection between the cyclic connected quantized weyl algebra cq 2 n and the quantum cluster algebra qq of the quiver denoted p 1 n 1 in the classification of periodic mutation by fordy and marsh 11 we shall express this quantum cluster algebra as a quotient u u of an iterated skew polynomial extension u of k with central in u both u and u u contain cq 2 n as a subalgebra the quiver p 1 n 1 has n 1 vertices which we label 0

commutation matrix let dq denote the quotient division algebra of tq and pq the quantum cluster algebra qq for p 1 n 1 is the subalgebra of dq generated by all possible cluster variables and by the laurent phenomenon it is a subalgebra of tq our next step is to use the exchange relations 3 4 23 or 20 2 3 to identify some further quantum cluster variables the mutation illustrated in figure 4 is in the direction of w 0 where the quiver has its source and yields the new quantum cluster variable wn 1 and the seed w 1 w 2 wn 1 where by the exchange relations wn 1 w 1 0 1 qw 1 wn 1 q 1 w 1 wn w 1

the automorphism of a restricts to an automorphism of p which we also denote and v is central in p so we can form the ambiskew polynomial ring b r p v 1 thus b u r the multiplicatively closed set s

connected quantized weyl algebras lqn and c q n are quantizations in the sense of 4 iii 5 4 of poisson algebras in other words there are poisson brackets on the polynomial algebra k x 1 xn that are semiclassical limits of the families l q n and c q n the poisson algebra that is the semiclassical limit of cq 2 n was introduced by fordy 12 and this sparked our interest in cqn in this section we shall present results of an analysis of the poisson prime spectrum of the semiclassical limits of lqn and c q n this analysis was carried out in parallel with that of the prime spectra of lqn and c q

with poisson centre k and extend the poisson bracket to the polynomial algebra s t with t s 0 for all s s then the non zero poisson prime ideals of s t are the ideals of the form t s t for some k proof as chark 0 it follows from 15 lemma 6 2 that the poisson core i of any maximal ideal of s is prime by poisson simplicity i 0 so s is an integral domain it is clear that the ideals t s t are poisson prime with s t t s t s let p be a non zero proper poisson prime ideal of s t and let d be the minimal degree in t of non zero elements of p then d 0 as p s is a poisson ideal of s and must be 0 it is easy to verify that j s s std sd 1 t d 1 s 0 p for some sd 1 s 0 s is a poisson ideal in s by poisson simplicity 1 j so there exist sd 1 s 0 s such that f td sd 1 t d 1 s 0 p for each s s deg s f d so sd 1 s 0 pz s k thus the prime ideal p k t is non zero and as k is algebraically closed t s t p for some k by the poisson simplicity of s t t s t p t s t in remark 2 2 we observed that the semiclassical limit of the relation xy qyx 1 q is x y xy 1 a similar discussion shows that the semiclassical limits of the relations xy qyx 0 and xy q 1 yx 0 are given by x y xy and x y xy respectively the semiclassical limit of lqn is the polynomial algebra fn with the poisson bracket given by xi xi 1 xixi 1 1 if 1 6 i 6 n 1 xi xj xixj if i 1 i 1 j 6 n and j i is odd xi xj xixj if i 1 i 1 j 6 n and j i is even this can be made formal by applying the quantization procedure described in 15 2 1 and 4 iii 5 4 to the algebra obtained from lqn on replacing the parameter q by a central invertible indeterminate q and taking h q 1 the poisson algebra obtained on equipping fn with this bracket will be denoted fln 34 christopher d fish and david a jordan similarly for odd n 3 the family cqn q k has semiclassical limit fn with poisson bracket given by xi xi 1 xixi 1 1 if 1 6 i 6 n 1 xi xj xixj if i 1 i 1 j 6 n and j i is odd xi xj xixj if i 1 i 1 j n and j i is even xn x 1 xnx 1 1 the poisson algebra obtained on equipping fn with this bracket will be denoted f c n there is a poisson automorphism of fcn analogous to the automorphism of c q n in 2 14 iv given by xi xi 1 where subscripts are taken modulo n in 1 2 n notation 7 4 we specify n distinguished elements z 1 z 2 zn of f l n by the same re currence formula as in section 3 z 1 0 z 0 1 and for i 0 zi 1 zixi 1 zi 1 note that if tl is the localization of fn at the multiplicatively closed set generated by z 1 z 2 zn then tl k z 1 1 z 1 2 z 1 n because for 1 j n xj zj zj 2 z 1 j 1 it follows that z 1 z 2 zn are algebraically independent let sl k z 1 z 2 zn and u k z 11 z 1 2 z 1 n 1 and note that u zn is the localization of fn at the multiplicatively closed set generated by z 1 z 2 zn 1 the formulae listed in the following result can be deduced from lemmas 3 2 3 3 and 3 4 and corollary 3 5 by passing to the semiclassical limit or by direct calculation lemma 7 5 in the poisson algebra fln the following hold i for 1 i n zi x 1 zi 1 2 zi 2 ii for 1 i j n xi zj 1 i 1 xizj if j is odd and j i 1 0 if j is even and j i 1 zi 2 zi 1 xi zi if j is odd and j i 1 zi 2 if j is even and j i 1 0 if j is odd and j i 1 i 1 xizj if j is even and j i iii for 1 i j n zi zj 0 if j is odd or i j are both even zizj if j is even and i is odd thus sl is a poisson subalgebra of f l n with the log canonical poisson bracket deter mined by the n n skew symmetric matrix n ij such that for j i ij 1 if j is even and i is odd 0 otherwise connected quantized weyl algebras and quantum cluster algebras 35 lemma 7 6 if n is odd then the ideals zn fn k are poisson prime ideals of f l n if n is even then znfn and the ideals znfn zn 1 fn k are poisson prime ideals of fln proof it follows easily from lemma 7 5 ii that the listed ideals are all poisson as zn zn 1 xn zn 2 and by degree zn 2 zn 1 fn 1 it is readily checked by induction that zn is irreducible in fn it follows as fn is a ufd that zn fn is prime for all thus zn fn is poisson prime for all if n is odd and when 0 if n is even suppose that n is even and that 6 0 as xn 1 zn 2 mod znfn zn 1 fn there is a poisson isomorphism between fn znfn zn 1 fn and fn 1 zn 1 fn 1 so znfn zn 1 fn is poisson prime proposition 7 7 for n 2 let sl tl and u be as in notation 7 4 i if n is even then tl is poisson simple ii if n is odd then tl u z 1 n u is a poisson simple subalgebra of tl and zn is poisson central iii the non zero proper poisson prime ideals of fln are the ideals zn fn k if n is odd and znfn and the ideals znfn zn 1 fn k if n is even proof i this follows from lemma 7 5 iii and proposition 7 2 in the application of the latter which is analogous to the proof of lemma 3 7 the rows of n should be considered in the order 2 4 6 n n 1 n 3 n 5 1 ii if n is odd zn is poisson central by lemma 7 5 iii and u is poisson simple by the even case iii by lemma 7 6 the listed ideals are poisson prime let p be a non zero poisson prime ideal of fn by lemma 7 5 ii if zm p for some m n then zj p for 0 j m and in particular 1 z 0 p so zm p for m n and pu zn is a poisson prime ideal of u zn which as observed in 7 4 is the localization of fn at the multiplicatively closed set generated by z 1 z 2 zn 1 suppose that n is odd by ii u is poisson simple so by lemma 7 3 pu zn zn u zn for some k as zn fn is prime in fn it follows from standard localization theory for example 29 theorem 5 32 that p zn fn now suppose that n is even by ii tl which is the localization of u zn at the powers of zn is poisson simple so zn pu zn if pu zn znu zn then p znfn by 29 theorem 5 32 so we can assume that pu zn znu zn as u zn znu zn u it follows from the odd case that pu zn znu zn zn 1 u zn for some k by 29 theorem 5 32 p znfn zn 1 fn we now turn our attention to the poisson algebra fcn note that for 1 i n the pois son subalgebra k x 1 xi coincides with f l i the poisson brackets among the elements z 1 z 2 zn 1 and x 1 x 2 xn 1 are as before the following lemma can be deduced from lemma 4 1 by passing to the semiclassical limit or by direct calculation lemma 7 8 let n 3 be odd and let zn 1 xn zn 2 zn 2 fn 36 christopher d fish and david a jordan i for 1 j n 2 xn zj zjxn zj 1 if j is odd zj 1 if j is even ii xn zn 1 zn 2 zn 2 iii iv is poisson central in fcn one might expect that by analogy with fln when n is odd the non zero poisson prime ideals of fcn would be the ideals fn however there are two exceptional non zero poisson primes m 1 such that f c n m f l n 2 zn 2 f l n 2 to establish the existence of these we shall need to calculate zn 3 zn 3 lemma 7 9 let n 3 be odd the following hold in fcn i x 1 zn 3 2 zn 4 x 1 zn 3 zn 2 ii let 2 i n 2 then xi zn 3 1 ixi zn 3 iii let 0 i n 3 then zi zn 3 i 1 zn i 3 if i is odd zi zn 3 i 1 zn i 3 if i is even iv zn 3 zn 3 zn 3 zn 3 1 proof i by lemma 7 8 i xn zn 3 zn 4 the result follows by applying and using lemma 3 2 ii by lemma 7 5 ii xi 1 zn 3 1 ixi 1 zn 3 and the result again follows on apply ing iii the result is true when i 0 in which case zi 1 and by i when i 1 in which case zi x 1 let i 1 and suppose that the result holds for i and for i 1 if i is even then zi 1 zn 3 zixi 1 zi 1 zn 3 zixi 1 zn 3 zixi 1 zn 3 i 1 zn i 3 xi 1 i zn i 2 by ii and induction i zn i 3 x 1 zn i 2 i 2 zn i 4 by 7 5 i i 2 zn i 4 connected quantized weyl algebras and quantum cluster algebras 37 which is the result for i 1 in this case if i is odd then zi 1 zn 3 zixi 1 zi 1 zn 3 xi 1 i 1 zn i 3 zixi 1 zn 3 zi 1 zn 3 i zn i 2 by ii and induction i x 1 zn i 3 zn i 2 zn 3 zixi 1 zi 1 i 2 zn i 4 zn 3 zi 1 by 7 5 i i 2 zn i 4 zn 3 zi 1 which is again the result for i 1 in this case the result follows by induction iv this is the special case of iii when i n 3 lemma 7 10 i let 1 let fn fn 2 be the k algebra homomorphism such that xi xi for 1 i n 2 xn 1 zn 3 and xn zn 3 let fn 2 fn 2 zn 2 fn 2 be the canonical epimorphism and let then f c n f l n 2 zn 2 f l n 2 is a poisson homomorphism ii for 1 let m ker then m is a poisson prime ideal of f c n and is maximal as a poisson ideal of fcn as an ideal of fn m is generated by zn 2 xn 1 zn 3 and xn zn 3 also zn 1 m zn 2 m and 2 m proof i write and for and respectively we need to show that xi xj xi xj for 1 i j n this is clear when j n 2 let j n 1 if i n 3 then xi xn 1 1 i 1 xizn 3 and by lemma 7 5 ii xi xn 1 xi zn 3 1 i 1 xizn 3 it follows immediately that xi xj xi xj also xn 2 xn 1 xn 2 xn 1 1 xn 2 zn 3 1 zn 2 zn 4 1 whereas by lemma 7 5 ii xn 2 xn 1 xn 2 zn 3 zn 4 as zn 2 zn 4 1 zn 4 2 1 0 it follows in this case also that xi xj xi xj now let j n if 2 i n 2 then a calculation similar to that in the case j n 1 i n 3 but with lemma 7 9 rather than lemma 7 5 shows that xi xj xi xj 1 i xj zn 3 and hence that xi xj xi xj this leaves the cases i 1 and i n 1 in the latter xn 1 xn xn 1 xn 1 2 zn 3 zn 3 1 zn 3 zn 3 1 as 2 1 and by lemma 7 9 iv xn 1 xn 2 zn 3 zn 3 zn 3 zn 3 1 it follows that xn 1 xn xn 1 xn finally x 1 xn 1 x 1 xn 1 x 1 zn 3 1 zn 2 2 zn 4 by 7 5 i whereas by lemma 7 8 i x 1 xn x 1 zn 3 xn zn 3 2 zn 4 38 christopher d fish and david a jordan as 1 zn 2 2 zn 4 2 zn 4 1 2 0 it follows again that xi xj xi xj ii it is clear that is surjective and hence by lemma 7 7 and the first isomorphism theorem for poisson algebras that m is poisson prime and maximal as a poisson ideal clearly zn 2 m xn 1 zn 3 m and xn zn 3 m also m fn 2 is poisson prime in fln 2 and by lemma 7 7 must be zn 2 fn 2 let w xn 1 zn 3 and y xn zn 3 then fn fn 2 w y and so m m fn 2 wfn 2 yfn 2 zn 2 fn 2 wfn 2 yfn 2 also zn 1 zn 2 xn 1 zn 3 zn 2 xn 1 xn 1 zn 3 m zn 2 zn 2 xn zn 1 m by lemma 7 8 ii and 2 zn 1 xn zn 2 zn 2 m proposition 7 11 let n 3 be odd and let sc be the polynomial algebra k z 1 zn 1 and tc be the laurent polynomial algebra k z 1 1 z 1 n 1 1 i sc is a poisson subalgebra of f c n and the poisson brackets on sc and tc are the log canonical poisson brackets determined by n ii tc u 1 where u k z 11 z 1 2 z 1 n 1 is a poisson simple subalgebra of tc and is poisson central iii the non zero proper poisson prime ideals of fcn are the ideals fn k and the two ideals m 1 and m 1 from lemma 7 10 iv for k the poisson algebra fcn f c n is poisson simple if and only if 6 2 proof the proofs of i and ii are completely analogous to those of the odd part of propo sition 7 7 with replacing zn iii the ideals m 1 are poisson prime by lemma 7 10 the ideal f c n is poisson as is poisson central by lemma 7 8 iv and prime as for zn fn in the odd part of proposition 7 7 so all the ideals listed are poisson prime let p be a non zero poisson prime ideal of fcn by lemma 7 5 ii if zm p for some m n 1 then zj p for 0 j m and in particular 1 z 0 p so zm p for m n 1 if also zn 1 p then p f c n for some k as in the proof of the odd part of proposition 7 7 iii with replacing zn so we may assume that zn 1 p by lemma 7 8 ii zn 2 zn 2 xn zn 1 p so zn 2 zn 2 p fn 1 by total degree zn 2 zn 2 zn 1 fn 1 so by proposition 7 7 iii p fn 1 which is poisson prime in fln 1 must have the form zn 1 fn zn 2 fn 1 for some k as zn 2 zn 2 p we also have that zn 2 p let 1 note that zn 2 xn 1 zn 3 zn 1 p so xn 1 zn 3 p also xn zn 2 1 p so by proposition 7 8 i zn 2 xn zn 3 p hence xn zn 3 p therefore xn 1 xn zn 3 p and as xn 1 zn 3 mod p xn 1 xn 2 zn 3 zn 3 p connected quantized weyl algebras and quantum cluster algebras 39 using lemma 7 9 iv xn 1 xn 1 2 zn 3 zn 3 1 p but we also have that xn 1 xn zn 3 p so xn 1 xn xn 1 zn 3 p and xn 1 xn 2 zn 3 zn 3 p combining this with 2 1 p so we must have 1 and we now know that p contains z xn 1 zn 3 and xn zn 3 and it then follows from lemma 7 10 that m p by the maximality of m p m iv this is immediate from iii and the fact that by lemma 7 10 ii 2 m 8 commutative cluster algebras with poisson structure let n 3 be odd let n 3 be odd in this section we aim to present the commutative cluster algebras a of the quivers an 1 and p 1 n 1 considered in section 6 as poisson simple algebras j j where j is a polynomial algebra with a poisson bracket and is a poisson central element of j we first consider p 1 n 1 if w 0 w 1 wn are the initial cluster variables then a is a poisson subalgebra of the laurent polynomial algebra r k w 10 w 1 1 w 1 n with the log canonical bracket such that for 0 i j n wi wj ijwiwj where if j i ij ji 1 if j i is odd 0 if j i is even 22 with the matrices b and as in section 6 13 theorem 1 4 ensures that the above poisson bracket is compatible with the cluster algebra a in other words for each seed y 1 y 2 yn and for 0 i j n yi yj ijyiyj for some antisymmetric n 1 n 1 matrix ij lemma 8 1 the poisson algebra r is poisson simple proof let m 0 m 1 mn z be such that m 0 i 0 mn in 0 for 0 i n from the cases i 0 and i n 1 m 1 m 3 mn 2 mn 0 m 1 m 3 mn 2 mn whence mn 0 similarly the cases i 1 and i n give m 0 m 2 mn 1 0 m 0 m 2 mn 1 and m 0 0 repeating the argument deleting the first and last columns at each stage gives 0 mn 1 m 1 mn 2 m 2 m n 1 2 by proposition 7 2 r is poisson simple as in the quantum case there are new cluster variables wi and xi i z such that for i n wi w 1 i n 1 1 wi nwi 1 for i 0 wi w 1 i n 1 1 wi nwi 1 40 christopher d fish and david a jordan and for i z xi w 1 i wi 1 wi 1 the following can be deduced from the quantum counterpart lemma 6 5 by taking the semiclassical limit or directly from 22 parts i

the subalgebra of r generated by the cluster variables w 1 w 0 w 1 wn wn 1 x 1 x 2 xn by lemma 8 2 iv x 0 xn so by 23 w 1 w 0 xn w 1 and for j 2 wj wj 1 xj 1 wj 2 hence the list of generators can be reduced to w 0 w 1 x 1 x 2 xn by lemmas 8 2 iv and 8 3 a is a poisson subalgebra of r notation 8 4 let d k w 0 w 1 wn 1 be a polynomial algebra in n 2 variables and let e k w 10 w 1 1 w 1 n wn 1 let j be the subalgebra of e generated by w 0 w 1 x 1 x 2 xn where for 1 i n xi w 1 i wi 1 wi 1 observe that wi 1 wixi wi 1 from which it follows that d j e and hence that j is a polynomial algebra in n 2 indeterminates w 0 w 1 x 1 x 2 xn connected quantized weyl algebras and quantum cluster algebras 41 lemma 8 5 there is a poisson bracket on d and hence on e such that for 0 i j n 1 wi wj wiwj if j i is odd 0 if j i is even and j i n 1 2 w 1 wn if i 0 and j n 1 also j is a poisson subalgebra of d proof note that the given rules for wi wm determine log canonical poisson brackets on each of k w 1 wn 1 and k w 0 w 1 wn to establish the jacobi identity on d it suffices to check it on the triples w 0 wi wn 1 0 i n 1 if i is odd then w 0 wi wn 1 w 0 wiwn 1 2 w 1 wiwn wi wn 1 w 0 w 0 wiwn 1 2 w 1 wiwn and wn 1 w 0 wi 2 w 1 wn wi 0 so the jacobi identity holds if i is even then w 0 wi wn 1 0 wi wn 1 w 0 and wn 1 w 0 wi 2 w 1 wn wi 0 so the jacobi identity holds again also for 1 i n wi is a derivation on d and wn 1 is the restriction to d of the derivation n 1 i 0 fi i where each i wi f 0 2 w 1 wn fi 0 if i 0 is even and fi w 1 wn 1 if i is odd as r s r s and rs r s s r for p is a derivation for all p d so we have a poisson bracket on d and hence by 25 lemma 1 3 on e the following can be deduced from the poisson bracket on d xi xi 1 2 xixi 1 1 if i n 27 xn x 1 2 xnx 1 1 28 xi xi 2 k 2 xi 2 kxi if 1 i i 2 k n 29 xi xi 2 k 1 2 xi 2 k 1 xi if 1 i i 2 k 1 n 30 xi wi wi 1 wi 1 31 xiwi 2 wi 1 32 2 wi 1 xiwi 33 xn w 0 xnw 0 2 w 1 34 xi wj xiwj if i j is odd and j 0 or j 1 35 xi wj xiwj if i j is even j 6 i and j 0 or j 1 36 it follows that j is a poisson subalgebra of d proposition 8 6 let w 0 wn 1 w 1 wn 1 then is poisson central in d e and j also d e and j are poisson prime ideals of d e and j respectively and both e e and j j are poisson simple proof for 1 i n either i is even and wi wn 1 0 wi w 0 and wi wn w 1 wi w 1 wn or i is odd and wi wn 1 w 0 wi w 0 wn 1 and wi wn 0 42 christopher d fish and david a jordan wi w 1 in both cases wi 0 also wn 1 wn 1 2 wnw 1 2 wn 1 wnw 1 0 and w 0 w 0 2 wnw 1 2 w 0 wnw 1 0 hence pz d it follows that pz e and pz j as is irreducible and poisson central in d d is a poisson prime ideal of d observe that e is the localization of d and also of the intermediate ring j at the multiplicatively closed set w generated by w 0 w 1 wn and that w d it follows that e is a poisson prime ideal of e so that is irreducible in e as w 0 w 1 wn are by an easy induction using the formula wi 1 wixi wi 1 prime elements of j it follows that is irreducible in the ufd j hence j is a poisson prime ideal of j there is a poisson algebra homomorphism from r to e e given by wi 7 wi e for 0 i n as wn 1 e w 1 0 w 1 wn is surjective and as r is poisson simple by lemma 8 1 is an isomorphism thus e e is poisson simple suppose that j j is not poisson simple by 23 3 3 ii j has a poisson primitive and hence poisson prime ideal q such that j q j recall that e is the localization of j at w so qe is a poisson prime ideal of e strictly containing e by the poisson simplicity of e e qe e and therefore q w 6 as q is prime wi q for some i with 0 i n by 34 xn w 0 xnw 0 2 w 1 and if i 0 then by 32 and 33 xi wi xiwi 2 wi 1 2 wi 1 xiwi it follows that wj q for 0 j n 1 but w 0 wn 1 w 1 wn 1 q so 1 q contradicting the fact that q is proper thus j j is poisson simple proposition 8 7 the cluster algebra a is isomorphic to the simple poisson algebra j j proof recall the poisson isomorphism from r to e e such that wi 7 wi e and note that xi 7 xi e we have observed that a is the subalgebra of r generated by w 0 w 1 x 1 x 2 xn and is a poisson subalgebra of r hence a a which is generated by w 0 e w 1 e and the n elements xi e 1 i n as j e j by standard localization theory j j embeds in e e by b j 7 b e and j j is generated by w 0 j w 1 j and the n elements xi j 1 i n so j j a thus a j j remarks 8 8 in accordance with the quantum case a has a poisson automorphism such that wi wi 1 giving rise to an infinite orbit wi i z and xi xi 1 giving rise to a finite orbit wi 1 i n the full set of cluster variables in a is the union of n orbits namely the infinite orbit wi i z and the n 1 finite orbits j zk 0 j n 1 1 k n 1 where the elements zk are as in section 7 the poisson analogue of theorem 6 7 where w 0 could be omitted from the generators is more subtle here w 0 x 1 w 1 x 1 w 1 2 so the omission of w 0 from the generators would require an appropriate definition of generators of a poisson algebra in the case of the dynkin quivers an 1 we have the following result the proof is omitted as is that of the subsequent analogue of corollary 6 2 it is parallel to that of proposition 6 1 connected quantized weyl algebras and
