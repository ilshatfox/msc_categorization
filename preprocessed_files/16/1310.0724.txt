have noetherian coho mology rings a property inherited from their component parts the proof is an adaptation of evens proof of finite generation of group cohomology we apply the result to a series of examples of finite dimensional hopf algebras in positive characteristic 1 introduction the cohomology ring of a hopf algebra encodes potentially useful information about its structure and representations it is always graded commutative see for example 25 for many classes of finite dimensional hopf algebras it is also known to be finitely generated for example cocommutative hopf algebras fried lander and suslin 13 small quantum groups ginzburg and kumar 14 and small quantum function algebras gordon 16 etingof and ostrik 11 conjec tured that it is always finitely generated as a special case of a conjecture about finite tensor categories snashall and solberg 23 made an analogous conjecture for hochschild cohomology of finite dimensional algebras that was seen to be false when xu 27 constructed a counterexample in contrast there is neither a counterexample nor a proof of the hopf algebra conjecture each finite generation result so far has used in crucial ways known structure of a particular class of hopf algebras further progress will require new ideas in this article we present one technique for handling some types of algebras inductively many hopf algebras of interest are skew group algebras that is smash products with group algebras under some conditions on a skew group algebra we show that its cohomology is noetherian if the same is true of the underlying algebra on which the group acts date october 21 2017 2010 mathematics subject classification 16 e 40 16 t 05 key words and phrases cohomology hopf algebras skew group algebras this material

2 van c nguyen and sarah witherspoon specifically if a is a finite dimensional augmented algebra over a field k with an action of a finite group g by automorphisms there is a spectral sequence re lating the cohomology of the smash product a kg definition in section 2 as an augmented algebra to that of each of a and g it is essentially the lyndon hochschild serre spectral sequence this allows us to use the framework of evens classic proof of finite generation of group cohomology 12 to prove that the coho mology rings of some smash products are noetherian theorem 3 1 in order to do this we need a particularly nice set of permanent cycles in the cohomology of a in the finite group case these cycles exist due to an application of evens norm map in our setting there may be no such norm map and we instead hypothesize existence of these permanent cycles we focus on a class of examples in section 5 found by cibils lauve and the second author 9 that satisfy our hypotheses we prove finite generation of the cohomology of these noncommutative noncocommutative hopf algebras in positive characteristic while our main theorem is tailored to suit these examples we state and prove it in the abstract setting in order to add one more tool to the collection of techniques available for proving finite generation our restrictive hypotheses serve to highlight the difficulty in adapting methods designed for the finite group setting where serendipity reigns we thank d benson and p symonds for very insightful conversations and suggestions we thank solberg for computing the cohomology of some of the nichols algebras in section 4 these computations led us to our general result on this series of nichols algebras and corresponding hopf algebras 2 definitions and notation throughout this article let k be a field all algebras will be associative algebras over k and all modules will be left modules finite dimensional over k let k let g be a finite group acting on a finite dimensional augmented k algebra a by automorphisms let a kg be the resulting smash product or skew group algebra that is a kg as a vector space with multiplication a g b h a gb gh for all a b a and g h g for simplicity we will drop tensor symbols in this notation from now on we assume the action of g preserves the augmentation of a so that a kg is also augmented with augmentation map a kg a kg k defined by a kg ag a a for all a a g g we use the symbol k also to denote the one dimensional a module respectively a kg module on which a respectively a kg acts via its augmentation let h a k ext a k k and h a kg k ext a kg k k both are algebras under yoneda composition the embedding of a into a kg as a subalgebra induces a restriction map resa kg a h a kg k h a k finite generation of cohomology 3 on cohomology there is an action of g on h a k that may be defined for example via the diagonal action of g on the components of the bar resolution for a there is a similar action of g on h a kg k that is trivial since it comes from inner automorphisms on a kg 3 finite generation of cohomology in this section we prove our main theorem that under certain hypotheses the cohomology ring h a kg k of a kg is noetherian theorem 3 1 let g be a finite group acting on a finite dimensional augmented algebra a preserving the augmentation map assume that im resa kg a contains a polynomial subalgebra over which h a k is noetherian and free as a mod ule with a free basis whose k linear span is a kg submodule of h a k then h a kg k is noetherian remarks 3 2 a the hypothesis that im resa kg a contains a polynomial subalgebra over which h a k is noetherian together with the left module version of 15 corol lary 1 5 implies that h a k is left noetherian b we did not specify the characteristic of the base field k in the theorem if the characteristic of k does not divide the order of g then kg is semisimple and its co homology is trivial except in the degree 0 in this case h a kg k h a k g the invariant ring under the action of g here one can use invariant ring theory in the noncommutative setting to show that the conclusion of the theorem holds see for example 19 corollary 4 3 5 for the proof of theorem 3 1 we assume the characteristic of k divides the order of g proof we use the lyndon hochschild serre spectral sequence see for example 5 chapter vi in a very general setting e p q 2 e p q 2 k h p g hq a k hp q a kg k let er k denote the resulting rth page and note that for each q h q a k is a finite dimensional k vector space note that e 0 is a submodule of e 0 2 since no dr e p q r e p r q r 1 r ends on the vertical edge it follows that the restriction map h a kg k e 0 2 k is part of the following commuting diagram h a kg k resa kg a h 0 g h a k h a k g e 0 k e 0 2 k we can identify e 0 with the image of the restriction map in e 0 2 4 van c nguyen and sarah witherspoon let t k 1 m denote the polynomial subalgebra of im resa kg a hy pothesized in the statement of the theorem the action of g on h a k restricts to the trivial action on t since it is a subalgebra of im resa kg a therefore by the universal coefficients theorem h g t h g k t an isomorphism of graded algebras let s h g k e 0 2 k let r be the subring of e 2 k generated by s and t by the above observations r s 1 m a polynomial ring over s in m indeterminates that we also denote by 1 m for convenience since d 2 vanishes on the horizontal edge r ker d 2 so r projects onto a subring of e 3 k h e 2 k d 2 similarly r projects onto a subring of er k for every r 0 including therefore we may consider er k to be a module over r for every r 0 including claim 1 e 2 k is a noetherian module over r proof of claim 1 by hypothesis there are homogeneous elements 1 t h a k that form a free basis of h a k as a t module and for which v spank 1 t is a kg submodule of h a k let l h g v note that l contains a copy of s h g k as v must include an element in degree 0 that is in h 0 a k k which has trivial g action by hypothesis h a k k 1 m v and so e 2 k h g k 1 m v further k 1 m has trivial g action and the module h a k for this poly nomial ring is free with free basis 1 t it follows that as a kg module k 1 m v i 1 im 0 i 11 im m v i 1 im 0 v a direct sum of copies of the same kg module v therefore by the universal coefficients theorem e 2 k is the image of h 0 g k 1 m h g v k 1 m l under cup product we thus identify e 2 k with s 1 m s l since g is a finite group and v is a finite dimensional vector space over k l h g v is noetherian over s h g k 12 by the hilbert basis theorem for graded commutative rings see for example 15 theorem 2 6 s 1 m sl is noetherian over r s 1 m therefore e 2 k is noetherian over r we have proven claim 1 claim 2 the spectral sequence stops i e er e for some r finite generation of cohomology 5 proof of claim 2 let zi be the space of i cocycles and bi be the space of i coboundaries in ei ei k recall that e 1 z 1 and e 2 z 2 b 2 consider the pull back br in e 2 of dr er as follows each element of e 2 on which d 2 vanishes determines an element of e 3 suppose d 3 vanishes on that element so that it in turn determines an element of e 4 con tinue placing such restrictions until we determine an element of er and suppose that element is in the image of dr we define br e 2 ker di for 2 i r 1 and im dr note that br is an r submodule of e 2 since dj is a derivation for all j 2 j r and the image in each ej of r consists of universal cycles moreover br br 1 so we obtain an ascending chain of r submodules of e 2 0 b 1 b 2 since e 2 is noetherian over r by claim 1 this chain must stabilize by the as cending chain condition thus there exists some r 0 finite such that br 0 br 0 1 br 0 2 and so dr 0 for all r r 0 this implies er e for all r r 0 we have proven claim 2 we can put this together to finish the proof of the theorem each zr br is a submodule of e 2 over r s 1 m thus each er which is a submodule of a quotient module of er 1 is noetherian over r by claim 1 and induction on r by claim 2 e is noetherian over r and so by 15 corollary 1 5 it is a noetherian ring now h a kg k has a filtration whose filtered quotients are ep q k f php q a kg k f p 1 hp q a kg k suppose that h a kg k is not noetherian and let t 1 t 2 h a kg k be an infinite ascending chain of ideals of h a kg k let f pti ti f ph a kg k and ui p 0 f pti f p 1 ti e k if x ti 1 ti then for some p x f pti 1 but x f pti and x f p 1 ti 1 so x f p 1 ti 1 is not in the image of the inclusion f pti f p 1 ti f pti 1 f p 1 ti 1 that is x ui 1 ui so ui 1 properly contains ui for all i therefore we have an infinite ascending chain of ideals of e k u 1 u 2 6 van c nguyen and sarah witherspoon this contradicts the result that e k is noetherian hence h a kg k is noetherian remark 3 3 theorem 3 1 parallels the main step in evens proof of finite gener ation of group cohomology let h be a finite p group where k has characteristic p a kz is the group algebra of a central subgroup z of h of order p and g h z in case z is complemented in h we obtain kh a kg whereas more generally kh is a crossed product of a with g in this case evens norm map is applied to show that im reskh kz contains a polynomial subalgebra k in one indeterminate one observes that h kz k is a free module over k and that the k linear span of any free basis is a kg submodule this special case is somewhat simpler than our more general context as it uses a polynomial ring in one indeterminate we are particularly interested in those actions of finite groups g on algebras a for which a kg is a hopf algebra we turn to a class of such examples in the remainder of the paper 4 examples nichols algebras in positive characteristic in this section we first recall the nichols algebras a from 9 corollary 3 14 and the corresponding hopf algebras a kg from the same paper we will prove that these hopf algebras have finitely generated cohomology this will follow from theorem 3 1 and explicit calculation using anick s resolution 4 in this section we explain these calculations for a and in the next we complete the proof of finite generation of cohomology of a kg the results of this section were anticipated by solberg 24 as a consequence of computer calculations for small p that gave the graded vector space structure and generators of cohomology in the remainder of the paper k will be a field of characteristic p 2 the case p 2 is included in 9 but is different and we will not consider that case here let a be the augmented k algebra generated by a b with relations ap 0 bp 0 ba ab 1 2 a 2 and augmentation a k given by a b 0 let g be a cyclic group of order p with generator g acting on a on the right by g a a g b a b 1 then a kg is a hopf algebra with comultiplication given by g g g a a 1 g a b b 1 g b 1 to apply results in 20 we changed from the left g module structure g a a g b b a to this right g module structure finite generation of cohomology 7 it is useful to consider a as a quotient of a larger algebra let 4 1 b k a b ba ab 1 2 a 2 so that a b ap bp we will show that b is a pbw algebra in the sense of 8 or 22 section 2 although we will not need this fact for our cohomology calculations choose the lexicographic order on n 2 for which 0 1 1 0 and assign deg a 0 1 deg b 1 0 then ba ab 1 2 a 2 is a gro bner basis for the ideal of the free algebra k a b that it generates it follows that aibj i j 0 is a vector space basis of b the relation ab ba 1 2 a 2 satisfies the required condition in the definition of a pbw algebra since deg a 2 deg ab so b is a pbw algebra moreover b is a koszul algebra by a theorem of priddy 21 theorem 5 3 applying 9 3 9 one finds that the elements ap bp are in the center of b we may thus apply a theorem of shroff 22 theorem 4 3 to the nichols algebra a to conclude that the cohomology ring h a k of a is noetherian we will need some details about this cohomology of a for the next section for this we will construct anick s resolution 4 for a and show that it is minimal we use the combinatorial description of the resolution given by cojocaru and ufnarovski 10 however we index differently and use left modules instead of right this is a free resolution of the trivial a module k of the form a kc 2 a kc 1 a kc 0 k 0 for finite sets cn where kcn denotes the vector space with basis cn let c 0 1 and c 1 a b then c 2 a p bp ba is the set of tips or obstructions to define cn in general consider the graph 1 a boo ap 1 ii bp 1 hh ii the elements of cn correspond to paths of length n that start at 1 we label such paths with the product of all elements through which the path passes including the endpoint in this way we obtain c 3 a p 1 bp 1 bpa bap c 4 a 2 p b 2 p bp 1 a bpap bap 1 8 van c nguyen and sarah witherspoon and in general c 2 m 1 b kpa m 1 k p 1 bkp 1 a m 1 k p k 0 1 m 1 c 2 m b mp bkpa m k p bkp 1 a m 1 k p 1 k 0 1 m 1 for qualitative understanding of the differentials give each of the generators a b of a the degree 1 we claim that the differentials preserve degree where the graded module structure of a tensor product a kci is given by deg a x deg a deg x if a x are homogeneous this claim results from the recursive definition of the differential d in each homological degree by construction d applied to elements of a kc 1 is multiplication and to a kc 2 takes each tip to the gro bner basis element to which it corresponds suitably expressed as an element of a kc 1 the remaining differentials are defined iteratively via splitting maps in each homological degree that are also defined iteratively since the relations are homogeneous and differentials in low homological degrees preserve degrees of elements the splitting maps and differentials in higher degrees may be chosen to have the same property now note that c 2 m 1 consists of elements of degree m 1 p 1 and c 2 m consists of elements of degrees mp and m 1 p 2 therefore elements of cn and of cn 1 never have the same degree as a consequence the differential takes elements of cn to elements of a cn 1 where a denotes all elements of a of positive degree and these are in the kernel of the augmentation map when applying the functor homa k then the induced differentials all become 0 therefore in this case anick s resolution is minimal and for each n the dimension of hn a k is n 1 5 examples pointed hopf algebras in positive characteristic we wish to apply theorem 3 1 to the hopf algebrasa kg introduced in the pre vious section in order to do this we next give some of the details from shroff 22 section 4 as they apply to these examples in particular recall the pbw algebra b defined in 4 1 let a b b b k be the k linear functions given by a r s a b r s b where a respectively b is the scalar coefficient of a p respectively bp in the product rs in b these functions are denoted 1 2 in 22 extend ing to left b module homomorphisms in homb b 3 k under the isomorphism homb b 3 k homk b 2 k the functions a b are coboundaries on the bar resolution of b as shown in 22 and they factor through a b ap bp the resulting functions which we will also denote a b by abuse of notation are no longer coboundaries they represent nonzero elements in the cohomology of a corresponding to permanent cycles in the may spectral sequence for a as a filtered algebra see 18 theorem 3 or 26 5 4 1 on page e 1 of this spectral sequence finite generation of cohomology 9 their counterparts generate a polynomial ring over which e 1 is finitely generated by the elements 1 a b a b where a b have cohomological degree 1 functions dual to a and b in homk gra k homgra gra gra k the cohomology h a k is finitely generated over its subalgebra generated by a b as a conse quence of the proof of 22 theorem 4 3 we will see below that the subalgebra generated by a b is in fact a polynomial ring in a b which is noetherian so applying the left module version of 15 corollary 1 5 h a k is itself left noetherian to verify the hypothesis of theorem 3 1 we will want 2 cocycles representing elements in h a kg k we use results in 20 where the notation is slightly different with x in place of a and y in place of b there it is shown directly that there are 2 cocycles a b in h a k generating a polynomial subring k a b results in 20 section 5 1 also imply that a b are in im resa kg a the needed elements in h a kg k are constructed explicitly using a twisted tensor product resolution in 20 section 3 3 we next claim that h a k is free with free basis 1 a b a b over the polynomial subalgebra k a b 2 this will follow once we see that the set ia j b la m b i j 0 l m 0 1 represents a basis of h a k since a b commute with each other note that the cohomology of s gra is well known and has a basis precisely of this form recall that anick s resolution for a is minimal and a comparison shows that in each degree the dimensions of h a k and of h s k are the same this forces the may spectral sequence 18 for a to collapse at e 1 h s k and so grh a k h s k and h a k has basis as claimed therefore h a k is indeed free as a k a b module further the k linear span of 1 a b a b is a kg submodule of h a k we compute g a a b g b b g a b a b we have shown that the hypotheses of theorem 3 1 are satisfied therefore h a kg k is noetherian question 5 1 are there more examples of nichols algebras in positive charac teristic to which theorem 3 1 applies nichols algebras and their bosonizations which are hopf algebras have only just begun to be explored in positive characteristic there is a vast and recent literature on nichols algebras in characteristic 0 see for example 1 2 3 17 2 since b is a koszul algebra h b k b the koszul dual of b which is generated by a b by abuse of notation with relations dual to those of b that is 2 a 1 2 a b 2 b 0 b a a b these relations also hold in h a k however we do not need this fact 10 van c nguyen and sarah witherspoon references 1 n andruskiewitsch f fantino m gran a and l vendramin
