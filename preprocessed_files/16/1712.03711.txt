frobenius constant quantizations a power operation is an enhanced version of a pth power map one of the most famous examples is steenrod s operations 15 a cornerstone of algebraic topology in section 2 we will give an account of steenrod s construction in the language of derived categories in these terms the construction itself is very simple and it yields not only steenrod s cohomology operations but also operations in borel moore ho mology which are presumably related to the kudo araki dyer lashof operations 11 9 a reader who knows about equivariant constructible derived categories on complex algebraic varieties will be able to understand these constructions even if they do not know any homotopy theory perhaps this is an advantage 1 2 in section 3 we will introduce a different type of power operation due to bezrukavnikov kaledin 6 which is an important tool in non commutative alge braic geometry such a power operation is known as a frobenius constant quanti zation essentially a frobenius constant quantization of a commutative algebra a over fp is a 1 parameter flat deformation a of a in associative algebras which has a large center see subsection 3 1 for a precise definition which also justifies regarding such a thing as a power operation the main example is the weyl algebra fpr sxx by prb xs q which contains xp bp in its center 1 3 we will then illustrate a general method to apply steenrod s construction to produce frobenius constant quantizations it is not completely clear just how general this method may be but heuristically it ought to work whenever the multi plication in a is somehow related to if not directly inherited from the homotopy commutative multiplication of a based loop group the example which we use to illustrate the method is the quantum coulomb branch of braverman finkelberg nakajima 4 or rather its natural characteristic p version that is we prove theorem 1 1 for any complex reductive algebraic group g and finite dimensional representation n of g and any odd prime p the quantum coulomb branch is a frobenius constant quantization steenrod operators the coulomb branch and the frobenius twist i 3 the coulomb branch is the g equivariant borel moore homology of a certain algebraic space r the quantum coulomb branch is obtained by switching on loop rotation equivariance the key geometric insight behind the theorem is that following ideas of beilinson drinfeld 1 one may deform the space r with its p action by loop rotation torp with its p action by permuting the factors cyclically 1 4 this is already quite a broad class of examples for instance it includes partially spherical rational cherednik algebras see 2 17 it is expected that the same underlying geometry will lead to the discovery of large centers of related algebras in fact in section we indicate how the same underlying geometry shows that the k theoretic version of integral quantum coulomb branch which is it self a q deformation of the k theoretic version of the coulomb branch admits a large center when q is evaluated at any complex root of unity not necessarily of prime order essentially the only difference with the homological case is to replace steenrod s construction with a so called adams construction which is to adams operations as steenrod s construction is to steenrod s operations question 1 2 are there such things as equivariant elliptic borel moore homology and equivariant elliptic k homology can we similarly deduce the analogous large center statements for these in the loop group situation 1 5 in part ii of this work we apply the same method in the case n 0 but to the entire satake category we thus obtain a triangulated monoidal central functor f d b gpoqpgrg fpq d b gpoq c pgrg fpqr 1 s where is the first chern class of b c the approach is entirely analogous to gaitsgory s central sheaves 10 there is a perverse tate cohomology functor p h 0 tate d b gpoq c pgrg fpqr 1 s pervsphpgr fpq and we show theorem 1 3 let g denote the langlands dual group to g over fp let s reppg q pervsphpgr fpq be the geometric satake equivalence 13 then the functor s 1 ph 0 tate f s reppg q reppg q is isomorphic to the frobenius twist functor the operation of perverse tate cohomology is strictly necessary in general how ever if a representation of g has a zp free lift then we can cook up its frobenius twist on the nose using the same geometry we will formulate this precisely and propose some links to derived geometric satake and the finkelberg mirkovic conjecture in the next installment warning 1 4 the proof of theorem 1 1 relies quite heavily on the theory of placid ind schemes dimension theories etc see 14 the first half of section 3 simultaneously reviews this theory and introduces the examples which are relevant for us as such it is written to be reasonably convincing with the key facts explained in full detail but with some details missing all of the details are available in 14 which the reader is strongly recommended to read acknowledgements i wish to thank many people for their interest help and en couragement even if they are not aware of it including d ben zvi a braverman p etingof v ginzburg i loseu d vogan special thanks go to d nadler and v drinfeld for inviting me to speak about this project at their seminars causing a 4 gus lonergan dramatic improvement in my productivity levels to g williamson for raising the question 1 what is the representation theoretic meaning of the steenrod algebra action on mod p cohomology which this project is an attempt to answer to my adviser r bezrukavnikov for eternal patience and support and to j louveau whom this is for 2 steenrod s construction 2 1 overview let p be an odd prime number and let p be the group of complex pth roots of unity let r be a commutative ring let k be a field of characteristic p and let f k k be the frobenius map let x be a topological space and let dbpx rq denote the bounded derived category of sheaves of k modules on x we write x p for mapp p xq following steenrod 15 we construct a functor st dbpx rq db ppx p rq wheredb ppx p rq denotes the bounded p equivariant derived category of sheaves of r modules on x p this functor is not linear or triangulated but nonetheless if we take r k compose with restriction to the diagonal and apply to morphisms between shifted constant sheaves we obtain linear maps f h npx kq hpn p px kq i j pn h ipx kq bhjpb p kq 2 1 for each n 0 recall that h pb p kq kra s is the super polynomial algebra in one variable a of degree 1 and one variable of degree 2 here is the first chern class of the tautological complex line bundle on b p arising from the embedding p c the direct sum of the maps of equation 2 1 is not in the most naive sense an algebra homomorphism this fact led steenrod to introduce certain correction factors which make it so his famous cohomology operations are then defined to be the coefficients of the resulting algebra homomorphism in the monomial basis of kra s however the sum of maps of equation 2 1 does give a homomorphism of super graded algebras h px kqp 1 q h ppx kq h px kqra s 2 2 where h px kqp 1 q denotes the frobenius twist of h px kq naively one might think that this is just the p dilation of f h px kq this is wrong rather the nat ural and correct definition of the frobenius twist of an algebra a in any symmetric monoidal category over k is as the tate cohomology ap 1 q h 0 ppa b pq where the symmetric monoidal structure endows ab p with the structure of p equivariant algebra in the case of the super graded k algebra h px kq the un derlying super graded k module of this construction is the same as the p dilation of f h px kq but the multiplication differs by a sign 2 removal of which is part of the purpose of steenrod s correction factors 1 at the aim workshop sheaves and modular representations of reductive groups march 28 to april 1 2016 2 when p 3 mod 4 steenrod operators the coulomb branch and the frobenius twist i 5 we prefer therefore to use steenrod s operations in their raw form that is without the correction factors and packaged as in equation 2 2 this has the ad vantage of revealing the fundamental connected between steenrod s operations and the artin schreier map which is obscured by the correction factors fact 2 1 let x bt for some complex torus t then the picard group of x is canonically isomorphic to the character lattice x pt q of t and the cohomology ring is the polynomial algebra h px zq sym z x pt q with x pt q in degree 2 this is equal to the ring optzq of polynomial functions on the canonical z form of the scheme t liept q likewise we have h px kq optkq where tk denotes the canonical k form of t under this identification the map of equation 2 2 factors as optkq p 1 q as optkqr s optkqra s where as corresponds on the level of k points to the k equivariant family pa rameterized by p k of additive maps of free k modules k b tk k p 1 q b tk i xi b vi i px p i p 1 xiq b vi for a basis tviu of tfp this family interpolates between the usual artin schreier map for 1 and the frobenius map for 0 remark 2 2 the appearance of as in the topological setting was the first indi cation that steenrod s construction might be related to the theory of frobenius constant quantizations where as plays a central role see fact 3 2 2 2 steenrod s construction recall that p is an odd prime p is the group of complex pth roots of unity r is a commutative ring k is a field of characteristic p and x is a topological space we denote by cbpx rq dbpx rq the bounded cochain derived categories of sheaves of r modules on x if y is a topological space with an action of p we denote by c b p py rq db ppy rq the corresponding p equivariant categories since p is a finite group these are the same as the bounded cochain derived categories of p equivariant sheaves of r modules on y consider the functor of pth external tensor power c bpx rq bp cbpx p rq it sends quasi isomorphisms to quasi isomorphisms and so descends to a non triangulated functor dbpx rq bp dbpx p rq by the universal property of derived categories notice that the cochain level functor factors as bp cbpx rq stc cb ppx p rq cbpx p rq to make this explicit we first choose an isomorphism p z p t 1 pu rps 6 gus lonergan the result will be independent of this choice write for the generator of p corresponding to 1 under the isomorphism then for a complex a we give the complex pa qbp i 1 ip ai 1 b baip the p equivariant structure by letting the generator act by the direct sum of the canonical isomorphisms of sheaves ai 1 b baip pai 2 b baip bai 1 q each twisted by the sign p 1 qi 1 pn i 1 q the sign twist is the natural koszul choice which makes the action of p commute with the differential moreover given a chain map f a b fbp is automatically a p equivariant chain map since the functor cb ppx p rq cbpx p rq reflects quasi isomorphisms it follows im mediately that stc descends to a functor std as below bp dbpx rq std db ppx p rq dbpx p rq writing for the suspension functor we have std pstd also std is not triangulated nor additive or even linear the following two propositions control the failure of linearity proposition 2 3 suppose given two parallel morphisms f g a b in dbpx rq then the morphism stdpf gq stdpfq stdpgq stdpa q stdpb q is an induced map that is there exists some non equivariant map h pa qb p pb qb p such that the equivariant map avphq xp p xhx 1 stdpa q stdpb q is equal to stdpf gq stdpfq stdpgq proof let us right away replace a b by isomorphic objects so that f g become genuine maps of complexes let f g denote the constant functions p tf gu with respective values f g then p acts freely on tf gu p tf gu choose a set th 1 hnu of orbit representatives n p 2 p 2 q p then each hi determines a non equivariant map pa qb p pb qb p hence so does their sum h then we have pf gqb p fb p gb p xp p xhx 1 where by definition xhx 1 is the composition xhx 1 pa qb p x pa qb p x phq x pb qb p pb qb p where the two isomorphisms are given by the equivariant structures proposition 2 4 std is frobenius multiplicative with respect to the action of the multiplicative monoid r on hom sets that is std determines a functor std ind r rd bpx rq db ppx p rq steenrod operators the coulomb branch and the frobenius twist i 7 which respects multiplication by r here the category on the left is obtained from dbpx rq by regarding each hom set as a set with an action of the multiplicative monoid r and inducing along the pth power map of monoids r r note that indrrd bpx rq is not an additive category in general however sup pose that r k and k is perfect in that case the frobenius map of monoids is actually a map of rings f and is moreover bijective write m k mod k set for the forgetful functor where k set denotes the category 3 of sets with action of the multiplicative monoid k we have the following lemma 2 5 suppose that k is a perfect field of characteristic p then we have m f indkk m proof indeed in that case both f and ind k k are equivalent to functors which do not change the underlying abelian group set and only change the way that k acts it follows that if k is a perfect field of characteristic p we have produced a k multiplicative functor std f dbpx kq db ppx p kq since f dbpx kq is triangulated we find this statement somewhat nicer that the version for general r 2 3 localization the category db ppx p rq is enriched in a triangulated sense over h ppx p rq that is the monoidal structure of db ppx p rq gives maps of r modules hn ppx p rq homdb p px p rqpr nrq homdb p px p rqpid nq for each n 0 whose sum is a map of algebras in particular db ppx p rq is enriched in the same sense over h pp rq h pb p rq r b l z pzr s p q here is the first chern class of the tautological line bundle on b p corresponding to the embedding p c in particular this super commutative ring receives a map from r bl z zr s rr s so that db ppx p rq is enriched over rr s thus we may consider the 2 periodic r linear triangulated category db ppx p rqr 1 s which is enriched over r bl z pzr s p qr 1 s r bl z fpr 1 s the degree 0 component of this ring is r p and the natural map from r to here is the modular reduction map in particular there is a frobenius map of rings f r r bl z fpr 1 s in this way it makes sense to ask whether a functor from a triangulated category enriched over r to one enriched over r bl z fpr 1 s is frobenius linear 3 the reader may prefer to replace this by its full subcategory of all k sets with a unique stable point 8 gus lonergan proposition 2 6 the composition st 1 d d bpx rq std db ppx p rq db ppx p rqr 1 s is exact frobenius linear and preserves direct sums proof first we prove that st 1 d preserves direct sums let a b be complexes in dbpx rq we argue as in the proof of proposition 2 3 that we have stdpa b q stdpa q stdpb q ind p 1 c for some complex c in dbpx p rq here ind p 1 is the averaging functor ind p 1 d bpx p rq db ppx p rq bi adjoint to the restriction functor res p 1 therefore it suffices to prove that the composition d bpx p rq ind p 1 db ppx p rq db ppx p rqr 1 s is isomorphic to 0 this follows by adjunction from the fact that res p 1 p q 0 next we prove frobenius linearity by proposition 2 4 it suffices to prove that st 1 d respects addition of parallel morphisms by proposition 2 3 it is enough to see that the image of an induced morphism in db ppx p rq in the localized category db ppx p rqr 1 s is 0 this we have shown in the previous paragraph finally we prove exactness first we must specify an exact structure i e an isomorphism e st 1 d st 1 d which makes the image under st 1 d of any triangle a triangle note that since p is odd there is a morphism in db ppx p rq of functors pp 1 q 2 p which becomes an isomorphism when is inverted already on the level of complexes we have a canonical isomorphism pstc stc the exact structure is taken to be the composition e st 1 d ppp 1 q 2 q pp 1 q 2 pst 1 d st 1 d this is indeed an isomorphism since the localized category is enriched over fp the reason for the factor ppp 1 q 2 q will be explained shortly thus given a triangle 4 b g c h a f b in dbpx rq we have a triangle st 1 dpb q st 1 dpgq st 1 dpc q st 1 dphq st 1 dp a q st 1 dp fq st 1 dp fq st 1 dp b q e 1 st 1 dpb q in db ppx p rqr 1 s we must show that this is exact whenever the original trian gle is since any exact triangle in a derived category is isomorphic to a semi split one we may assume that f is a chain map and c is the usual mapping cone satisfying cn an 1 bn 4 we have immediately rotated the arbitrary exact triangle a f b g c h a for convenience later steenrod operators the coulomb branch and the frobenius twist i 9 with differential d 0 f d so we have stcpc q i 1 ip pai 1 1 bi 1 q b b paip 1 bipq with some differential 5 this complex has a pp 1 q step equivariant increasing filtration stcpb q f 0 stcpc q fpstcpc q stcpc q where fistcpc q consists of the subcomplex of stcpc q in which at most i sum mands a are taken in the expansion of the external tensor product the inclusion of the zeroth piece of this filtration is equal to stcpgq while the quotient map stcpc q stcpc q fp 1 stcpc q stcp a q is equal to stcphq furthermore arguing as in proposition 2 3 we see that fistcpc q fi 1 stcpc q is an induced complex for each 1 i p 1 therefore the map stcpc q stcpb q stcp a q becomes an isomorphism in db ppx p rqr 1 s consider now the commutative diagram stcpb q stcpgq stcpc q stcpc q stcpb q stcpb q stcpb q stcpgq stcpc q stcphq pstcpa q pstcpfq pstcpb q of equivariant chain complexes here are the usual chain maps which make the image of the top row in db ppx rq an exact triangle is the quotient map whose image in db ppx rqr 1 s is an isomorphism and stc has been identified with pstc comparing with the definition of the triangle obtained by applying st 1 d to b g c h a f b we see that it is enough to prove that the diagram stdpc q stdpb q stdpb q ppp 1 q 2 q pp 1 q 2 pstdpa q pstdpfq pstdpb q commutes in db ppx rqr 1 s here we have written for their own images in db ppx rq let d be the cocone of a id a so that f induces a map d c we have a commutative diagram stcpd q stcpa q stcpa q stcpfq stcpc q stcpb q stcpb q where is the standard boundary map and the vertical arrows are induced 6 by f now becomes an isomorphism in db ppx p rq for the same reason that 5 which the reader may write down if desired its exact form is not important 6 without additional signs the sign changes in the horizontal rows are complementary 10 gus lonergan does therefore so does so it is enough to show that the composition of these two diagrams is commutative by functoriality of the resulting composition equals stdpd q stdpa q stdpa q pstdpfq ppp 1 q 2 q pp 1 q 2 pstdpa q pstdpfq pstdpb q let p pr rr ps 1 rr ps n 1 rr psq be the equivariant resolution of the trivial rr ps module supported in degrees p 1 pq 0 we have the standard chain maps p r which is an isomorphism in the equivariant derived category and p p 1 r which equals pp 1 q 2 by definition now is a chain map which is an isomorphism in the equivariant derived category but not in the equivariant complex category however there is a chain map pb stcpa q stcpd q stcpa q such that is induced by the standard chain map p r i e counit in degree 0 to see this it is enough to do the case a r and then tensor on the right with stcpa q in that case we are looking for an equivariant chain map from the complex r rr ps 1 rr ps n 1 rr ps supported in degrees p 1 to the complex e satisfying ei s rps s i rs where rs is a copy of r and with differential sending rs to sps rs tsu by p 1 1 1 q let us write 1 s for the canonical generator of rs one example of such a map is the map which sends the element 1 in the degree p 2 i 1 q copy of rr ps to the term i t t 2 pu t 2 i even block lengths 1 t 1 uyt and sends the element 1 in the degree p 2 i 2 q copy of rr ps to the term i t t 3 pu t 2 i even block lengths 1 t 1 uyt 2 uyt the sign is chosen so that is induced by the standard chain map p r we compute ppp 1 q 2 q pp 1 q 2 therefore the two paths stdpd q stdpa q pstdpb q in this composed di agram are equalized by since is an isomorphism in db ppx p rqr 1 s they coincide in the localized category as required corollary 2 7 suppose r k is a field of characteristic p then we have a triangulated k linear functor st 1 d f dbpx kq db ppx p rqr 1 s steenrod operators the coulomb branch and the frobenius twist i 11 2 4 six functors we are mainly concerned with the case where x is the borel quotient eg g y of a complex algebraic variety y by the action of some affine algebraic group g and r is a noetherian ring of finite homological dimension in this case we will replace the category db with its constructible analogue dbc that is any g equivariant constructible sheaf on y descends to a sheaf on x and dbcpx rq is the thick subcategory of d bpx rq generated by all such sheaves we will usually write dbc gpy rq instead of d b cpx rq the constructions of the previous section preserve constructibility so we have a steenrod construction std d b c gpy rq d b c g p p py p rq recall that we have the six functor formalism for constructible derived categories we assume that the reader is familiar with this material but remind him her of the standard notation for a g equivariant algebraic map f y y 1 we have the adjoint pairs of exact functors f dbc gpy 1 rq dbc gpy rq f f d b c gpy rq d b c gpy 1 rq f and also a pair of bi exact bifunctors p q b p q dbc gpy rq d b c gpy rq d b c gpy rq homp q dbc gpy rq op dbc gpy rq d b c gpy rq related by a tensor hom adjunction there is also a verdier duality functor d and an exceptional tensor product b which can be written in terms of the other functors as can the external tensor product b we call the collection of all of these functors the six plus functors notice that g p p is also an affine algebraic group so the six functor formalism exists for the target category of std also if f y y 1 is g equivariant then f p y p py 1 q p is g p p equivariant the following fact is essentially a consequence of the same fact for bp proposition 2 8 steenrod s construction is compatible with the six functor for malism that is we have canonical isomorphisms pf pq std stdf pf pq std stdf pf pq std stdf pf pq std stdf stdp q b stdp q stdp b q hompstdp q stdp qq stdhomp q commuting with any and all adjunction morphisms of the six functor formalism we have the same compatibilities with functors st 1 d remark 2 9 many of the six plus functors are defined in much more general con texts than the constructible derived category for instance f f are defined in complete generality and their compatibilities with steenrod s construction hold in that generality one expects that in some sense any time any of these functors is defined it is compatible with steenrod s construction but we wish to avoid making any precise statement along these lines 12 gus lonergan 2 5 tate s construction note that the object stdp nrq is canonically isomor phic to pnr with its trivial p equivariant structure here r is the constant sheaf since a degree n cohomology class is just a morphism r nr in dbpx rq we thus obtain a frobenius multiplicative map of multiplicative r sets sth hnpx rq hpn p px p rq this map is not frobenius linear but as in proposition 2 3 its deviation from additivity is by a class induced from hpnpx p rq to see how these maps interact with multiplication we make the following definition definition 2 10 let pc 1 e a sq be a symmetric monoidal abelian category enriched over some commutative ring r i e c is an abelian category is a bi exact r linear functor c c c 1 is an object of c e is a pair of equivalences 1 id id id 1 a is an associativity constraint for and s is a commutativity constraint for satisfying natural compatibilities let a be an object of c then s determines an action of p on a p and we define a p 1 q h 0 ppa pq kera p p 1 q ima p pnq this is the so called tate construction for a morphism f a b the morphism f p a p b p is p equivariant and so induces a morphism a p 1 q bp 1 q so that p qp 1 q becomes a functor lemma 2 11 p qp 1 q is additive over z proof we essentially rehash the proof of propositions 2 3 2 6 first we show that p qp 1 q is linear over z suppose f g a b are two parallel morphisms in c let f g denote the constant functions p tf gu with respective values f g then p acts freely on tf gu p tf gu choose a set th 1 hnu of orbit representatives n p 2 p 2 q p then each hi determines a non equivariant map a p b p and we have pf gq p f p g p xp p n i 1 xhix 1 restricting to kera p p 1 q this becomes ppf gq p f p g pqker a p p 1 q xp p n i 1 xhi n n i 1 hi which factors through imb p pnq as required next we show that p qp 1 q preserves direct sums let a b denote the con stant functions p ta bu with respective values a b then p acts freely on ta bu p ta bu choose a set tc 1 cnu of orbit representatives then each ci determines an object of c and as a p module in c we have pa bq p a p b p n i 1 cir ps the result then follows from the fact that h 0 ppkr psq 0 in r mod let svectk denote the symmetric monoidal category of z 2 super graded k vector spaces steenrod operators the coulomb branch and the frobenius twist i 13 lemma 2 12 suppose that r k is a field of characteristic p and that c admits a super fiber functor c svectk then p q p 1 q is exact monoidal and frobenius linear over k in the case c svectk p q p 1 q is equivalent to the functor kbf which tensors the k linear structure along the frobenius map f k k proof since tate s construction commutes with the fiber functor it is enough to take c svectk where it is a simple calculation using bases now suppose that a b are objects of c we have a p equivariant isomorphism pa bq p pa p b pq we have also the natural inclusions kera p p 1 q kerb p p 1 q kera p b p p 1 q ima p pnq kerb p p 1 q ima p b p pnq kera p p 1 q ima p pnq ima p b p pnq which induce a map ap 1 q bp 1 q pa bqp 1 q suppose that pa 1 a maq is a unital ring in c then ap 1 q still has a multiplication map 1 q a p 1 q ap 1 q pa aqp 1 q m p 1 q a ap 1 q also there is a canonical isomorphism ker 1 p p 1 q 1 hence a canonical surjection 1 1 p 1 q which determines a map 1 ap 1 q 1 1 p 1 q 1 p 1 q a ap 1 q one may check that this makes ap 1 q into a ring and moreover that ap 1 q is associa tive or commutative if a is the following lemma explains how this looks in the main example lemma 2 13 suppose a ipz 2 ai is a unital ring in c svectk then the ring structure on ap 1 q corresponds under the identification ap 1 q k

with the y th copy of aj for every p x y 1 arguing the same way we have the following proposition 2 14 let a be a hopf algebra in svectk then a p 1 q is naturally a hopf algebra in svectk it has multiplication and unit given as in 2 13 comultipli cation given by ap 1 q pr b aq r b p 1 q pp 2 qdeg b deg apaq 14 gus lonergan counit given by ap 1 q pr b aq rp apaqq p and antipode given by sap 1

over k concentrated in degree 0 p z 2 then opgmq comod contains as a full subcategory over svectk the category of z super graded vector spaces and tate s construction there is isomorphic to the functor which applies k bf p q and multiplies degrees by p recall we have the frobenius multiplicative maps of multiplicative k sets sth hnpx kq hpn p px p kq we view cohomology rings as commutative ring objects of z super graded vector spaces in particular we can apply functor p qp 1 q to them by lemma 2 5 if k is perfect then it gives a map of z super graded k sets stex h px kqp 1 q h ppx p kq the following fact is immediate from the constructions proposition 2 16 stex respects the multiplicative k monoidal structures remark 2 17 if k is not perfect then the map h px kq h ppx p kq of z 2 super graded sets respects the multiplicative monoidal structures up to the sign change of lemma 2 13 there is presumably an appropriate non linear version of tate s construction which would allow us to say that we really have a certain z super graded k monoid h px kq p 1 q nl and a map of monoids h px kq p 1 q nl h ppx p kq but we prefer for simplicity not to do it 2 6 borel moore homology we return to the setting of subsection 2 4 let denote the g equivariant dualizing complex on y with coefficients in r we have a canonical isomorphism 7 stdp q by definition the g equivariant borel moore homology of y is h bm g n py rq homdb g py rqpr n q see subsection 3 9 for more about this altogether hbm gn py rq form a z super gradedh gpy rq module in particular it is a module forh gp rq by functoriality we have the non linear maps st bm hbm gn py rq h bm g p p pn py p rq 7 here of course the second denotes the g p p equivariant dualizing complex on y p with coefficients in r steenrod operators the coulomb branch and the frobenius twist i 15 this is a map of sth monoids its discrepancy from additivity it averaged from hbm g p pn py p rq if r is a perfect field k of characteristic p we can say that we have a non linear graded map of stex monoids st bm ex h bm g py kq p 1 q h bm g p p py p kq 2 7 steenrod operations for simplicity let s assume k to be perfect from now on let us compose stex with the restriction map to the diagonal stin h px kqp 1 q stex h ppx p kq h ppx kq h px kqra s this is again a map of multiplicative k monoids tautologically we have stinpxq xp mod pa q also stin is compatible with pull back maps in cohomology in the natural way since induction commutes with restriction the difference between stinpx yq and stinpxq stinpyq is induced from a cohomology class z p h px kq since p acts trivially on x that means that it is equal to pz 0 so stin is linear that is we have a map of super commutative k algebras stin h px kqp 1 q h px kqra s remark 2 18 the coefficients of m a m in stin are not the steenrod operations more precisely they are the steenrod operations only up to some non zero scalars even more precisely let x p hnpx kq and let p 2 q 1 consider p 1 qqnpn 1 q 2 pq q nstinpxq where x is viewed as a degree pn element of h px kqp 1 q the coefficient of m in this expression vanishes unless m 1 2 pp 1 qpn 2 sq for some s such that 2 s n in which case that coefficient is equal to p 1 qsp spxq where p s is the sth steenrod operation similarly the coefficient of a m in that expression vanishes unless m 1 2 pp 1 qpn 2 sq 1 for some s such that 2 s n in which case that coefficient is equal to p 1 qs 1 p spxq where is the bockstein operation 2 8 artin schreier we indicate how the artin schreier map comes naturally out of the above considerations first note that if n is even then the number p 1 qqnpn 1 q 2 pq q n boils down to p 1 qn 2 it is a standard fact that on a degree 2 class x we have p 0 pxq x p 1 pxq xp and higher powers vanish therefore stinpxq x p p 1 x p 2 pxq let x bt for some compact torus t since its cohomology is supported in even degrees the bockstein operator acts as zero and stin on the level of k cohomology is exactly the artin schreier map optkq p 1 q as optkqr s optkqra s as defined in fact 2 1 recall that if g is a compact lie group with maximal torus t and p is large enough with respect to the weyl group of g then the projection bt bg induces an inclusion h pbg kq h pbt kq which is identified with optk w q optkq 16 gus lonergan the artin schreier map induces a map on subspaces optk w q p 1 q as optk w qr s which is also important in the theory of frobenius constant quantization the point is that this map is also induced by stin since it is compatible with pullbacks it is entertaining to show more directly how as arises without relying on any outside facts about steenrod operations we can reduce to the rank one case t s 1 let b denote the degree 2 generator first chern class of tautological line bundle of bs 1 we need to show that stinpbq b p p 1 b let cp s 1 denote the cyclic group of order p considered as distinct from p consider the projection bcp bs 1 it induces an injective map krbs krs bs in cohomology where s is a degree 1 generator by functoriality it is enough to prove the equality when b is regarded as a cohomology class of bcp note that amongst degree 2 p elements of krb s the desired element bp p 1 b is the unique one which gives 0 when we set b to any multiple in fp of and gives b p when we set 0 the latter statement is automatic so we have to check the former so fix some t p fp having chosen an isomorphism p cp t determines a group homomorphism p cp the constant sheaf nk of bcp is contained in the full subcategory d bpkrcps modq dcpp q dpbcpq our coefficients are k which we drop from the notation it is easier for our purpose to work in dbpkrcps modq compatible with the functor std out of dpbcpq we have the functor std d bpkrcps modq d bpkr p pcpq ps modq this is then composed with the diagonal restriction dbpkr p pcpq ps modq dbpkr p c ps modq by definition stinpbq is given by applying that composition to the morphism k b kr 2 s where k is the trivial cp module we want further to set b t this corre sponds to restricting along the map p id t p cp write pid tq dbpkr p cps modq d bpkr ps modq for the corresponding restriction map we need to show that pid tq stpbq 0 but actually there is an isomorphism of functors pid tq std std i where i is the forgetful functor dbpkrcps modq dcpp q dp q indeed for an object a of dbpkrcps modq the underlying complex of both functors is pa qb p and the automorphism which sends each summand a i 1 b baip steenrod operators the coulomb branch and the frobenius twist i 17 to itself by 1 b t b 2 t b b pp 1 qt intertwines the two actions of p here is some generator of p but the functor st i kills b since i does 3 coulomb branch 3 1 prelude frobenius constant quantizations let k be a field of charac teristic p and let c be a symmetric monoidal category over k the reader may assume that c is the category of comodules of some commutative hopf algebra in svectk let a be a commutative and associative algebra in c let f ap 1 q a be the frobenius map let q be an augmented commutative algebra in c with augmentation q k following 6 we make the following definition definition 3 1 1 a q quantization of a is a flat associative q algebra aq in c such that aq bq k a 2 a frobenius constant q quantization of a is a q quantization aq of a together with a map fq a p 1 q zpaqq of algebras which lifts the frobenius map i e such that fq f here zpaqq denotes the center of aq the main example for us is the following we take k to be some gm equivariant algebraic group in vectk and view o opk gmq as a hopf algebra in svectk concentrated in degree 0 we take c o comod let be a basis vector of the 1 dimensional representation of k gm in which k acts trivially and gm acts with weight 2 let q kr s in this case we will call a q quantization simply an quantization or just a quantization if the meaning is clear fact 3 2 1 let x be a smooth affine algebraic variety over k then the ring of asymptotic crystalline differential operators d pxq is a canonical quantization of opt xq here gm acts trivially on opxq and on vector field with weight 2 let b be a vector field on x then bp acts as a deriva tion on opxq so that bp brps annihilates opxq for a unique vector field brps then d pxq has a canonical frobenius constant structure determined by f x x p x p opxq b bp p 1 brps b p v ectpxq 2 let j be a smooth algebraic group over k then f as above is k j j equivariant induced by left and right regular actions in particular if we take invariants for the left factor we obtain a frobenius constant structure for the quantization u pjq of opliepjq q 3 let t be a complex torus and let t be the langlands dual split torus over k that is t specpkrx pt qsq where x pt q is the cocharacter lattice of t and krx pt qs is its group algebra we have canonical identifications oppt q q optkq u pt q optk gaq 18 gus lonergan if we take spec of the frobenius constant structure we recover the artin schreier map f as tk ga t p 1 q k of fact 2 1 remark 3 3 if a commutative algebra and its quantization contain in a natural way h g p kq for some complex reductive group g with maximal torus t then when searching for a frobenius constant structure it is natural to look for one which is compatible with the artin schreier map 3 2 formal neighborhoods let x be a smooth complex curve and let s be a finite set given a commutative ring r and an r point x of xs we denote the coordinates of x by xs s p s write pxsq for the graph of xs in xr and write ipxsq for its ideal we write spxq for the formal neighborhood of the union of the graphs of xs s p s that is spxq is the direct limit in affine schemes over x spxq colim i s ipxq where s ipxq spec oxr o sps ipxsq i given a subset s 1 s and an r point x of xs we will write s 1 s pxq for the s 1 punctured formal neighborhood i e the complement of the union of the graphs of xs s p s 1 in spxq as a sheaf of algebras on spxq op s 1 s pxqq has an exhaustive increasing filtration f j op s 1 s pxqq op spxqq sps 1 ipxsq j suppose we have s 2 s 1 s and x p xsprq the inclusion s 1 s defines a projection f xs xs 1 and we will occasionally write s 2 s 1 pxq for s 2 s 1 pfpxqq we have a closed embedding s 2 s 1 pxq s 2 s pxq note however that this is in a sense non uniform in x for instance if for every s p s there exists an s 1 p s 1 such that xs xs 1 then the embedding is an isomorphism and conversely this is essentially the fact underlying beilinson drinfeld s fusion grassmannian 1 we will make more of this when we discuss co placid morphisms see example 3 14 for notational simplicity we frequently remove commas and braces from s s 1 and also drop the part pxq when it is clear which point we refer to so for example the expression t 1 u t 1 2 u pxq becomes 112 steenrod operators the coulomb branch and the frobenius twist i 19 3 3 global groups pro smoothness now fix an affine algebraic group g over c consider the following functor from commutative rings to groups over xs gsprq tpx fq x p x sprq f spxq gu then gs is represented by the limit of an inverse system of smooth affine group schemes over xs gs lim i gs i such that each transition morphism is a smooth homomorphism here gs i may be taken to represent the functor gs iprq tpx fq x p x sprq f s ipxq gu later the notation gs i may represent a piece of some other cofiltered system pre senting gs we will refer to the specific group above by mapp s i gq the fact that each transition morphism is smooth is directly verified using the valuative cri terion indeed let specp rrq be a square zero thickening of specprq a commutative diagram specprq gs i 1 specp rrq gs i is the same thing as a point rx p xsp rrq with residue x p xsprq and a commutative diagram s ipxq s i 1 pxq s iprxq g this determines a morphism p g where p is the appropriate pushout in affine schemes since s ipxq is equal to the intersection of s i 1 pxq with s iprxq inside s i 1 prxq and s i 1 prxq is a square zero thickening of s i 1 pxq it follows that s i 1 prxq is a square zero thickening of p therefore since g is smooth we can extend p g to s i 1 prxq g as required note thatgs 0 xs so in particular each gs i is smooth over x s now fix x p xspcq it partitions s into subsets s 1 sn according to coin cidence amongst the coordinates write ym for the coordinate xs for any s p sm and zm for the c point of x sm with coordinates ym we have s ipxq spec ox l n m 1 ipymq i sm n m 1 spec ox l ipymq i sm therefore we have gs i xs txu n m 1 gsm i xsm tzmu n m 1 gtmu i sm xtmu tymu the smooth transition map gtmu pi 1 q sm xtmu tymu gtmu i sm xtmu tymu is surjective for all i 0 and has a unipotent kernel for all i 1 it follows that gs i 1 gs i has the same property thus gs is a prosaic affine group scheme over xs in the following sense definition 3 4 1 a scheme t over b is said to be pro smooth over b if it can be written as the limit of a inverse system of schemes ti smooth over b and with smooth transition morphisms if t is pro smooth then it is formally smooth in particular flat over t 20 gus lonergan 2 an affine groupoid scheme g over b is pro smooth over b if it can be written as the limit of an inverse system of affine groupoid schemes gi over b whose structure maps to b are both smooth and which has smooth transition homomorphisms 8 3 in 2 and 3 we can upgrade to the property of being a pro smooth cover by demanding that each transition map and structure map is a smooth cover 4 let the affine groupoid scheme g limipzop 0 gi over b be a pro smooth cover then each gi is the fpqc quotient over b of g by some pro smooth affine subgroup ki we say that g is prosaic if the ki can be chosen to be also pro unipotent 5 let g be an affine group scheme over the same base b then g is said to be pro smooth a pro smooth cover prosaic over b if it is so when regarded as a groupoid from now on groupoid will mean affine pro smooth covering groupoid unless it is clear from the context that this is not the case all examples of groupoids will actually be prosaic remark 3 5 recall the construction of gs if the affine algebraic group g is replaced by an arbitrary smooth affine variety t over c we get a pro smooth affine variety ts over x s in exactly the same way 3 4 beilinson drinfeld grassmannians reasonableness we also consider the functor gs 1 s prq tpx fq x p x sprq f s 1 s gu then gs 1 s is represented by an ind affine ind scheme formally smooth over x s it is a group in ind schemes over xs but not an inductive limit of group schemes it is a reasonable ind scheme in the following sense taken from 8 definition 3 6 1 an ind scheme t is reasonable if it admits a reasonable presentation that is an expression t colim jpj t j where j is some countable filtered indexing category and the transi tion morphisms in the filtered system of schemes pt jqjpj are all finitely presented f p closed embeddings 9 note that any two reasonable pre sentations admit a common refinement so that the category of reasonable presentations of t is filtered 2 a closed subscheme of a reasonable ind scheme t is reasonable if it is a term in some reasonable presentation of t 3 a morphism u t of reasonable ind schemes is co reasonable if for some equivalently any reasonable presentation t colim jpj t j of t the presen tation u colim jpj u t t j of u as an ind scheme is reasonable warning this is not a relative version of reasonableness for ind schemes 8 is this the same thing as an affine groupoid scheme g over b such that both structure mor phisms g b are pro smooth in the sense of 2 9 that is they have finitely generated ideal sheaves steenrod operators the coulomb branch and the frobenius twist i 21 example 3 7 1 let t be a reasonable ind scheme and let u t be either ind f p or an ind flat cover then u t is co reasonable 2 in the case of gs 1 s one reasonable presentation is given as follows fix a finite set ta 1 anu of generators of opgq then set j z 0 and set g s 1 j s to be the closed subscheme of g s 1 s which on the level of r points is given by g s 1 j s prq tpx fq x p x sprq f s 1 s g ak f p h 0 f j op s 1 s qu here we have taken g s 1 0 s gs the left and right regular actions of the subgroup gs preserve the inductive structure meaning that each g s 1 j s has a free action on both sides by gs over x s even though it is not itself a group moreover the fpqc quotient g s 1 j s gs is of finite type over x s and flat although generally quite singular the result is that the fpqc quotient gs 1 s gs has the structure of ind finite type ind flat ind scheme over xs in par ticular it is reasonable and gs 1 s gs is an ind flat cover and thus co reasonable on r points we may identify g s 1 s gsprq px e fq x p xsprq e a principal g bundle over spxq f a trivialization of e over s 1 s pxq here the symbol means taken up to isomorphism i e we identify two r points px e fq px 1 e 1 f 1 q if x x 1 and there exists an isomorphism of e with e 1 which intertwines f f 1 such an isomorphism is unique if it exists the following fact is due to 1 lemma 3 8 1 gs 1 s gs is ind projective over x s if and only if g is reduc tive 2 gs 1 s gs is ind reduced if and only if g has no non trivial characters remark 3 9 ultimately we are concerned only with the analytifications of these ind schemes so point 2 appears merely for interest s sake but point 1 is crucial for the definition of convolution in borel moore homology we may re identify the r points of gs 1 s in a way more compatible with the above identification of gs 1 s gsprq gs 1 s prq px e f gq x p xsprq e a principal g bundle over spxq f a trivialization of e over s 1 s pxq g a trivialization of e over spxq notice that the inclusion s 1 s induces a closed embedding s 2 s 1 s 2 s for any s 2 s 1 this in turn induces restriction homomorphisms gs 2 s g s 2 s 1 these maps are co reasonable one readily checks by looking at points that the induced maps g s 2 s gs x s s 1 g s 2 s 1 gs 1 22 gus lonergan are isomorphisms in particular we have gs 2 s gs xs s 2 g s 2 s 2 gs 2 remark 3 10 gss gs is known as the beilinson drinfeld grassmannian grs on s points in particular the fibers of gs 1 s gs over x s are products of copies of the ordinary affine grassmannian grg of g 3 5 jet bundles placidity we will use the following notion due to raskin 14 definition 3 11 1 a scheme t is called placid if it admits a placid presen tation that is an expression t lim ipiop ptiq for some filtered countable indexing category i such that each ti is of finite type over c and each transition morphism ti ti 1 is a smooth affine covering we will denote this placid presentation by ti 2 an ind scheme t is called placid if it admits a placid presentation that is an expression t colim jpj lim ippijqop pt j i q here j ij are filtered countable indexing categories t j ij is a placid pre sentation of its limit scheme t j lim ippijqop pt j i q and the transition mor phisms t j t j 1 are ind f p closed embeddings remark 3 12 1 if the placid ind scheme t maps to some base b of finite type over c then the placid presentation may be taken over b 2 let t be a placid ind scheme and let t colim jpj ptjq be a reasonable presentation of t then each tj is a placid scheme so that this reasonable presentation can be extended to a placid presentation 3 any two placid presentations of the placid ind scheme t admit a common refinement which is again a placid presentation thus the collection of placid presentations of t forms a filtered category ppt q 4 suppose that t is a placid ind scheme and u is an ind scheme with an ind f p map f u t then u is automatically placid the short explanation is by noetherian approximation we spell it out given any reasonable presentation t colim jpj pt jq of t we set uj u t tj and obtain the reasonable presentation u colim jpj pu jq of u then given any placid presentation t j lim ippijqop t j i of t j there exists some index a of ij such that there is a t ja scheme u j a fitting into a cartesian diagram u j t j u ja t j a steenrod operators the coulomb branch and the frobenius twist i 23 moreover since t j t ja is a covering the choice of t j a scheme u j a is unique thus if we replace ij by its final subcategory based at a we can present u j t j as the limit of a cofiltered system of f p morphisms pu j i t j i qippijqop such that for each i i 1 in i the square u j i 1 t j i 1 u j i t j i is cartesian placid presentations of this form will be called cartesian 5 the product over b of placid ind schemes is placid 6 consider placid presentations t colim jpz 0 lim ippz jqop pt j i q of t with the property that t j i is formed out of t j 1 i as in point 4 of this remark whenever i j 1 j we call such placid presentations neat this is possibly a technically useless notion but every placid presentation admits a refinement which is neat up to replacing the indexing categories j ij by final subcategories thus many constructions on placid ind schemes can be phrased in terms of neat presentations note that for any morphism f u t of placid schemes and any placid presentations u lim i iopu ui t lim i iopt ti then for any i p it there exists i 1 p iu and a unique map ui 1 ti making the square u t ui 1 ti commutative thus by changing the indexing sets appropriately we can choose placid presentations of u t with a common indexing set i and write f lim ipi pui tiq such a presentation will be called compatible this notion extends immediately to morphisms of placid ind schemes a cartesian presentation is a compatible pre sentation in which all appropriate squares are cartesian if g is an affine groupoid scheme over some base b of finite type over c and f is g equivariant over b then we can find a g equivariant compatible presentation if in addition f is f p so that it admits a cartesian presentation then this can also be chosen to be g equivariant the following definition is due to 14 10 definition 3 13 1 a morphism f u t between placid schemes is called co placid if for some equivalently every pair of placid presentations uiu tit of u t and for every index i p it then for some equivalently every 10 in loc cit a co placid map of placid ind schemes is called simply placid as noted in loc cit it is not a relative version of placidity for ind schemes this is the reason for the present renaming 24 gus lonergan index i 1 p iu such that we have a commutative square u f t ui 1 f 1 ti the morphism f 1 is a smooth covering 2 a morphism f u t between placid ind schemes is called placid if it is co reasonable and for some equivalently every reasonable presentation t colim jpj t j of t the map of placid schemes u t t j t j is co placid example 3 14 1 let t be a placid ind scheme let u t be either ind smooth or an ind pro smooth cover then it is co placid 2 gs 1 s is a placid ind scheme and the fpqc quotient map g s 1 s g s 1 s gs is an ind pro smooth ind affine affine cover of a placid indeed ind finite type ind scheme so is co placid 3 given s 2 s 1 s the morphism f gs 2 s x s xs 1 g s 2 s 1 is co placid indeed consider gs i mapp s i gq we have gs lim ipz 0 gs i and x s xs 1 gs 1 lim ipz 0 xs xs 1 gs i and the morphism gs i x s xs 1 gs 1 i induced by the closed embeddings s 1 ipxq s ipxq for any x p x sprq this is a smooth covering by the same argument of subsection 3 3 for the prosaicness of gs this shows that g gs x s xs 1 gs 1 is co placid to conclude note that the morphism f is an ind locally trivial g bundle over the ind finite type ind scheme gs 2 s gs x s xs 1 g s 2 s 1 gs 1 warning 3 15 morphism g is not a pro smooth cover 11 it is tempting to imagine that it is the quotient map by some group scheme kerpgs xs xs 1 gs 1 q but there is no such group scheme to see this fix some section s s 1 and consider the corresponding multi diagonal embed ding xs 1 xs then g is an isomorphism over xs 1 however over a generic point of xs g is a non trivial projection from gpoqs gpoqs 1 see subsection 3 8 for the notation 4 fix a representation n of g of dimension d let n specpsympn qq be the corresponding g module i e vector space in the category of schemes over c with g action then ns is a gs module 12 we have the placid ind scheme rt s 1 s g s 1 s xs ns 11 correspondingly f is not an ind pro smooth cover 12 indeed each mapp s i nq is a mapp s i gq module and the transition maps are gs equivariant steenrod operators the coulomb branch and the frobenius twist i 25 this is an ind pro smooth covering of its fpqc quotient relative to xs ind scheme t s 1 s g s 1 s xs gs ns this is an infinite dimensional vector bundle over gs 1 s gs on the level of r points we identify t s 1 s prq px e f rvq x p xsprq e a principal g bundle over

s 1 s gs t s 1 s lim i t s 1 s i where t s 1 s i is the associated bundle of ns i a vector bundle of rank di s in particular t s 1 s is a placid ind scheme with t s 1 j s being the infinite dimensional vector bundle t s 1 s gs 1 j s gs over g s 1 j s gs we identify the r points of rt s 1 s compatibly as follows rt s 1 s prq px e f g rvq x p xsprq e a principal g bundle over spxq f a trivialization of e over s 1 s pxq g a trivialization of e over spxq rv an n section of e 5 ns 1 s is a g s 1 s module in ind schemes therefore multiplication gives a map between the placid ind schemes t s 1 s n s 1 s we define rs 1 s to be the fiber product r s 1 s t s 1 s ns 1 s ns this is an ind scheme overgs 1 s gs withr s 1 j s t s 1 j s n s 1 s ns r s 1 s gs 1 j s gs moreover rs 1 s is a vector space over g s 1 s gs but unlike t s 1 s it is not a vector bundle because the fibers jump furthermore r s 1 j s contains kerpt s 1 j s t s 1 j s i q for i large enough depending on j that is we have a diagram kerpt s 1 j s t s 1 j s i q r s 1 j s t s 1 j s of vector spaces over g s 1 j s gs therefore r s 1 s is placid we may take r s 1 j s i to be the image in t s 1 j s i of r s 1 j s for i large enough also r s 1 s is of ind finite codimension in t s 1 s i e it is an ind f p closed sub ind scheme on 26 gus lonergan the level of r points we have r s 1 s prq px e f vq x p xsprq e a principal g bundle over spxq f a trivialization of e over s 1 s pxq v an n section of e such that fpvq extends to spxq here fpvq is a section of the trivial n bundle on s 1 s pxq and we require that it extends to a section of the trivial n bundle over spxq such an extension is unique if it exists we denote the preimage of rs 1 s in rt s 1 s as rr s 1 s it is an ind f p closed sub ind scheme of rt s 1 s an ind pro smooth cover of rs 1 s its fpqc quotient locally on x s by gs and on r points we identify rr s 1 s prq px e f g vq x p xsprq e a principal g bundle over spxq f a trivialization of e over s 1 s pxq g a trivialization of e over spxq v a section of the trivial n bundle on spxq such that fg 1 pvq extends to spxq 6 the product over b of co placid maps is co placid remark 3 16 1 suppose x ga with parameter t then ipxsq is trivialized by t txs there is an isomorphism from t s 1 s to the kernel of the covering t s 1 s t s 1 s i given on r points by px f e rvq px f e sps pt txsqrvq we call this isomorphism the fiberwise shift map of t 2 the placid ind scheme t gs 1 s gs t s 1 s r s 1 s is special in that one may take the smooth affine covering maps t j i t j i 1 to be vector bundles but placidity seems to be the more flexible definition for instance i do not know if point 3 of remark 3 12 holds if we replace placid by special 3 6 equivariance 1 note that gs 1 s gs t s 1 s r s 1 s are all acted on by gs and the various maps between them are gs equivariant in fact each approximation g s 1 j s gs t j i r j i is acted on by some quotient gs i 1 of gs and the transition mor phisms are all gs equivariant 2 suppose that x ga then we have the action of gm on x by multiplica tion it also acts diagonally onxs therefore we may considerc xs as a smooth groupoid over xs the group gs 1 s over x s is c xs equivariant so we may form the semidirect product g s 1 s c a placid affine groupoid ind scheme over xs the special case gs c is a prosaic affine groupoid scheme over xs then the gs equivariant structures of gs 1 s gs t s 1 s r s 1 s and their above approximations upgrade to gs c equivariant structures over xs again all morphisms transition or otherwise of the previous subsection are gs c equivariant steenrod operators the coulomb branch and the frobenius twist i 27 remark 3 17 1 let t be a placid ind scheme over some base b and g be a groupoid scheme over b which acts on t then we can always choose a g equivariant placid presentation of t simply by smoothing out any placid presentation by the action of g the category pgpt q of g equivariant placid presentations of t is filtered 2 now suppose that t is special i do not know whether we can choose the special presentation of t to be g equivariant however if t is special by virtue of being a placid vector space over some intermediate g equivariant ind scheme u of ind finite type t u b and g acts linearly then we can do it this is what happens for gs 1 s t s 1 s r s 1 s in the latter two cases we can take u gs 1 s gs in the former case we can take u to be the quotient of gs 1 s by the kernel of the surjection gs mapp s 1 gq 3 7 dimension theories the following definitions can be found in 14 and essentially in the earlier work 8 and probably in many other texts definition 3 18 1 let t be a placid scheme with a placid presentation t lim ippiqop ptiq a dimension theory on ti is a function d i z whose value on i p i will be written dptiq satisfying the condition dpti 1 q dptiq dimpti 1 q dimptiq whenever i i 1 in i 2 take a placid presentation t lim ippiqop ptiq of the scheme t

dimptiq for any i 1 p i such that i 1 i 1 in i 1 we have thus constructed a filtered system ptdimension theories on tiuqtipp indexed by the filtered category p of placid presentations of t 3 a dimension theory on t is an element of the colimit of the above filtered system now let f u t be an f p map of placid schemes and choose cartesian placid presentations indexed by i as in remark 3 12 in this presentation a dimension theory d on ti defines one on ui denoted 13 f d and given by the formula f dpuiq dptiq that is we have a map tdimension theories on tiu tdimension theories on uiu the

operators the coulomb branch and the frobenius twist i 29 remark 3 20 1 the set of dimension theories on a connected placid ind scheme t is a z torsor thus the set of dimension theories on a general placid ind scheme t is a z 0 pt q torsor for an ind f p resp co placid map f u t of placid ind schemes f resp f is a map of z 0 pt q sets 2 in fact there is a sheaf in an appropriate sense of z torsors on any placid ind scheme t whose set of global sections equals the set of dimension the ories on t we do not need to consider it since in every example of this paper this sheaf is trivial example 3 21 1 recall that t s 1 s is an infinite dimensional vector bundle over gs 1 s gs with approximations t s 1 j s i for j p z 0 and i p z for some positive integer depending on j see example 3 14 the approximation t s 1 j s i is a vector bundle over g s 1 j s gs of rank di s thus f t s 1 s gs 1 s gs is co placid and since g s 1 s gs is ind finite type it has a dimension theory d 0 with constant value 0 we will denote the dimension theory f d 0 on t s 1 s by rankpt s 1 s q we have rankpt s 1 s qpt s 1 j s i q di s it would perhaps be safer to call this rank gs 1 s gs pt s 1 s q but the notation becomes too unwieldy the reader should bear this in mind 2 let f rs 1 s t s 1 s be the defining ind f p closed embedding then we have the dimension theory f rankpt s 1 s q on r s 1 s we will call this simply rankpt s 1 s q 3 we also have the dimension theory on rt s 1 s obtained as the pullback of rankpt s 1 s q or of d 0 directly its pullback to rrs 1 s coincides with the pullback of the dimension theory rankpt s 1 s q on r s 1 s these dimension theories on rt s 1 s rr s 1 s will both be denoted rankp rt s 1 s q 4 we will denote the pullback to gs 1 s of the constantly 0 dimension theory on gs 1 s gs by rankpg s 1 s q it satisfies rankpgs 1 s qpg s 1 j s i q dimxs pgs iq dimpgs iq s 3 8 notational remark we will use the same notational simplification for gs 1 s t s 1 s r s 1 s rt s 1 s rr s 1 s as for formal neighborhoods for instance r t 1 u t 1 2 u may be written as r 1 12 fix a c point x p x and a local parameter t at x this determines isomorphisms 1 pxq specpoq 1 1 pxq specpkq where o crrtss k cpptqq the groups of c points of pg 1 qx pg 1 1 qx are put in isomorphism with gpoq gpkq note that since g 1 is pro smooth over x we have pg 11 g 1 qx pg 1 1 qx pg 1 qx we will write informally pg 1 qx gpoq 30 gus lonergan pg 11 qx gpkq pg 11 g 1 qx grg we will write pt 11 qx pr 1 1 qx as t r since these are ind f p sub ind schemes of t 1 1 they have dimension theories given by pulling back rankpt 11 q we will write the resulting dimension theories both as rankpt q these dimension theories correspond to the dimnpoq of 4 although dimension theories are not explicitly used in loc cit 3 9 borel moore homology rather than recall the general formalism of equi variant constructible derived categories on placid ind schemes see 14 we content ourselves with the following definition definition 3 22 1 let r be a commutative ring 15 let t be a scheme of finite type over the base b of finite type over c with an action of the affine algebraic groupoid g over b then t an has a gan equivariant constant sheaf r and dualizing complex with coefficients in r and we will write h n g pt rq h n ganpt an rq homdb gan ptanqpr n rq hbm gn pt rq h n ganpt an q homdb gan ptanqpr n q 2 now suppose that g is an affine groupoid scheme over b we may write g as the limit of its fpqc quotient affine algebraic groupoids pgiqipiop we may assume that action of g on t factors through each gi we set h g pt rq colim ipi h gipt rq and h bm g pt rq colim ipi h bm gi pt rq here we have used the fact that for any i i 1 in i the gi 1 equivariant complexes obtained from the gi equivariant constant sheaf respectively dualizing complex are canonically isomorphic to their gi 1 equivariant coun terparts thus these restriction functors determine the maps of equivariant cohomology respectively borel moore homology which we take colimits over 3 let t be a placid scheme over some base b of finite type over c and let g be an affine algebraic groupoid over b which acts on t let d be a dimension theory on t then the 2 d shifted g equivariant borel moore homology of t h bm g 2 d pt rq is defined as follows let t lim ippiqop ptiq be a g equivariant placid presentation of t observe that pullback defines a graded map of r modules h bm g 2 dptiq pti rq h bm g 2 dpti 1 q pti 1 rq whenever i i 1 in i since ti 1 ti is a dpti 1 q dptiq dimensional smooth covering we then set h bm g 2 d pt rq colim ipi h bm g 2 dptiq pti rq 15 there is a clash of notation here r denotes a ring of homological coefficients not necessarily over c rather than a geometric test ring over c i sincerely hope this is not a source of confusion steenrod operators the coulomb branch and the frobenius twist i 31 for different choices of placid presentation we get canonically isomorphic answers which justifies the definition 4 let f t 0 t 1 be a g equivariant ind f p embedding of placid ind schemes over b let d be a dimension theory on t 1 then there is a pushforward map f h bm g 2 f d pt 0 rq h bm g 2 d pt 1 rq defined by choosing cartesian placid presentations of t 0 t 1 indexed by i and observing that for each i p i the diagram h bm g 2 dpt 0 i 1 q pt 0 i 1 rq f h bm g 2 dpt 1 i 1 q pt 1 i 1 rq h bm g 2 dpt 0 i q pt 0 i rq f h bm g 2 dpt 0 i q pt 1 i rq commutes here the horizontal maps are pushforwards maps along the closed embeddings t 0 i t 1 i while the vertical maps are the pullback maps of point 1 the resulting map is independent of any choices we have made 5 now let t be a placid ind scheme over some base b of finite type over c and let g be an affine algebraic groupoid over b which acts on t let d be a dimension theory on t then we set h bm g 2 d pt rq colim jpj h bm g 2 f d pt j rq using the pushforward maps of point 2 of this definition for any choice t colim jpj pt jq of g equivariant reasonable presentation of t for dif ferent presentations we get canonically isomorphic colimits here we have written d for the unique dimension theory on t j compatible with the di mension d on t remark 3 23 1 since g is a pro smooth covering groupoid its action on any finite type approximation t j i to the placid ind scheme factors through the quotient h by some pro smooth covering subgroup we then have h bm g 2 dpt j i q pt j i rq h g pb rq bh h pb rq h bm h 2 dpt j i q pt j i rq 2 if moreover g is prosaic then we can choose the sub group in question to be also pro unipotent in which case we have h g pb rq h h pb rq so that h bm g 2 dpt j i q pt j i rq h bm h 2 dpt j i q pt j i rq 3 it may even happen that we can choose a section h g take for example x ga g g 1 c h g c x where g embeds in g 1 as the subgroup of constant functions in this case h acts on all of t and we have h bm g 2 d pt rq h bm h 2 d pt rq though it may give a psychological advantage since h is an actual smooth algebraic groupoid this reduction is usually technically unhelpful the following procedures in ordinary equivariant borel moore homology are also defined in the world of placid ind schemes fix a g equivariant placid ind scheme t over b of finite type over c and a dimension theory d on t 32 gus lonergan 1 change of groupoid base suppose that we have some finite type g space a over b then there exists a semi direct groupoid scheme g ba affine pro smooth over a suppose that t b factors through a then t is also g ba equivariant over a and we have a canonical isomorphism h bm g 2 d pt rq h bm g ba 2 d pt rq 2 open restriction let a b be a g equivariant open subscheme and let j t a t be the g equivariant ind f p ind open embedding 16 of placid ind schemes over a the restriction to a of a g equivariant placid presen tation of t is a g a equivariant placid presentation of t a and applying the ordinary open restriction in borel moore

schemes over b and let f 1 u 1 t 1 be a g equivariant section of p let g t t 1 be ind f p and let u t t 1 u 1 so that we have a cartesian square u f t g 1 g u 1 f 1 t 1 suppose we have a dimension

scheme over b ga we have the closed subscheme i t 0 u ga and the complementary open subscheme j gm ga let us write t g for the restrictions to gm and t 0 g 0 for the restrictions to t 0 u choose a g equivariant placid presentation t colim jpj lim ippijqop t j i of t over ga then by restriction we obtain a g equivariant placid pre sentation t colim jpj lim ippijqop pt j i q of t over ga and a g 0 equivariant placid presentation t 0 colim jpj lim ippijqop pt j i q 0 of t 0 over t 0 u both of which are cartesian with the original placid pre sentation since g is pro smooth covering we have specialization maps s j i h bm g ppt j i q rq h bm g 0 2 ppt j i q 0 rq which are compatible so yield s h bm g 2 j d pt rq h bm g 0 2 2 i d pt 0 rq we will write d j d d 0 i d 9 steenrod s

following facts carry over from the ordinary case 1 descent a suppose that h is a normal pro smooth covering subgroup of g over b and that the fpqc quotient group g h exists as a pro smooth covering group over b the main example here is g h b l for pro smooth covering groups h l over b suppose that h acts freely on t so that in particular the fpqc quotient relative to b t h exists as a g h equivariant placid ind scheme over b so the quotient map f t t h is g equivariant and co placid suppose that there exists a dimension theory d 1 on t h satisfying f d 1 d then the composition h bm g h 2 d 1 pt h rq h bm g 2 d 1 pt h rq f h bm g 2 d pt rq is an isomorphism b suppose that g l q where q is an algebraic group acting regu larly 18 on b and l is a q equivariant pro smooth covering group over b thus the maximal subgroup h l bqb is a pro smooth cover ing group over b and the quotient groupoid p g h pq bq qb is smooth over b let a b p b a suppose that we are given a slice i a b consider the placid g b ph aq equivariant ind scheme g a a t a on the one hand the normal subgroup ph aq acts freely and the quotient is t giving h bm g 2 d pt rq h bm g a h a 2 d 1 pg a a t a rq where d 1 is the pullback of d on the other hand the normal subgroup l acts freely and the quotient is q t a with its residual action of pq bq b ph aq pq h aq a b where h a acts trivially on b over a thus we have the isomorphisms h bm h a 2 d 2 pt a rq h q h a 2 d 2 2 dimqpq t a rq h bm g a h a 2 d 1 pg a a t a rq h pq h aq ab 2 d 2 2 dimqpq t a rq if d 2 is a dimension theory whose pullback along g a a t a q t a t a equals d 1 thus we obtain an isomorphism h bm h a 2 d 2 pt a rq h bm g 2 d pt rq 2 compatibilities these various maps between borel moore homology groups all commute with each other whenever this makes sense for in stance we have a if f u t resp p v t are ind proper resp co placid g equivariant maps so that we have a g equivariant cartesian square w f 1 v p 1 p u f t 18 i e the stabilizer groupoid qb b b pq bq is smooth over b steenrod operators the coulomb branch and the frobenius twist i 35 then we have p f f 1 pp 1 q b specialization commutes with proper pushforward restriction of equiv ariance co placid restriction and averaging to spell this out in the most complicated case take a restriction with supports framework as in 6 above with b ga and g a group we may restrict all the data over t 0 u or over ga t 0 u and obtain again restriction with supports frameworks we therefore obtain a square h bm g 2 d pt rq st h bm g 0 2 d 0 pt 0 rq pf ga t 0 uq pf t 0 uq h bm g 2 pdgq

the branch we assume from now on that x ga with global parameter t thus the 0 fibers gpoq of g 1 r of r 1 1 etc have actions of c we assume also that g is reductive so that gs 1 s gs is ind projective over x s we recall the definitions of 4 with respect to our notations definition 3 24 1 the coulomb branch overr is the gradedh gpoq p rq module a h bm gpoq 2 rankpt q pr rq 2 the quantum coulomb branch over r is the graded h gpoq c p rq h gpoq p rqr s module a h bm gpoq c 2 rankpt q pr rq here has degree 2 3 we will often write a a as simply a a lemma 3 25 a a are evenly graded and free over h gpoq p rq h gpoq p rqr s we have a canonical isomorphism a a proof the proof in 4 in the case r c works for any r the essential point is that the equivariant parameters are in even degrees and an equivariant placid presentation may be chosen such that each approximation has a complex cell decomposition we will also consider a h bm gpoq p 2 rankpt q pr rq the same proof shows that the natural map h pp rq brr s a a is an isomorphism in particular in the case r fp we have a a ras we have an averaging map a a which after identifying a r brr s a a h pp rqbrr sa is induced by the averaging map of rr s modulesr h p rq 19 that is if h g is of finite index over b and g 1 g is a map the fiber product h g g 1 is of finite index in g 1 and the two possible maps from the h equivariant bm homology to the g 1 equivariant homology coincide for some reason we have steadfastly avoided using quotient stacks if we had used them this would be an example of proper base change 36 gus lonergan this is the map which multiplies by p in degree 0 therefore in the case r fp the averaging map equals 0 remark 3 26 1 in 4 a a are given ring structures 20 by a form of con volution in borel moore homology they show 21 that a is commutative and a is an quantization of a we will recall the construction in the course of the proof of our main theorem the idea due originally to beilin son and drinfeld 1 is to express the multiplication in a by a manifestly commutative specialization map 2 recall that t is the fpqc quotient gpkq gpoq npoq of the placid ind scheme rt gpkq npoq both are ind pro smooth covers 22 of grg and have respective dimension theories rankpt q rankprt q given by their ranks over grg let us denote by rr the corresponding gpoq bundle over r it has a compatible dimension theory rankprt q by descent we have the isomor phism a h bm gpoq c 2 rankpt q pr rq h bm pgpoq gpoqq c 2 rankp rt q p rr rq and similarly for a this shows that a a have two module structures over h gpoq p rq in fact these module structures coincide with the left and right multiplication by a subalgebra h gpoq p rq a a since a is commutative these two module structures coincide everywhere however h gpoq p rq is not in the center of a so these two module structures are different there 3 11 the map f we will set r fp from now on the rest of this section is devoted to the proof and explanation of the following theorem theorem 3 27 a is a frobenius constant quantization of a we will construct the requisite map f using steenrod s construction and a specialization map first we introduce some new notation we will fix x ga with parameter t we will use another base curve y ga with parameter t p we have y x p where p c acts on x through the character given by restricting the weight one action of c let x y be the quotient map under the identifications x ga y is the p th power map and is c equivariant when c acts on y with weight p for y p y sprq we will use tp to identify the coordinates ys with elements of r then for y p y sprq we have the affine scheme s 1 s pyq specprrtsrr sps ptp ysqssr sps 1 ptp ys 1 q 1 sq now determines a twisted diagonal embedding x x p as the eigenline for the cyclic action of p let be one of the symbols g n t r rt rr then we will set ppq p p ppq ppq p p p 20 a is also a ring in the same way 21 for r c but it is true for any r 22 in fact ind pro smooth ind fiber bundles steenrod operators the coulomb branch and the frobenius twist i 37 here the symbol p means restrict along the twisted diagonal then take cate gorical quotient by p the action of p in question is the one that does not involve loop rotation i e that which scales x p xprq but does not change any of the data e f v etc these are all placid ind schemes over y and behave in essentially

ppq ppq q rankp t ppq ppq q etc which are compatible with each other in the same way as for the s 1 s and compat ible with the dimension theories on p p in the natural way 23 unlike s 1 s which is globally trivial over the coincidence free open subset of xs these spaces ppq ppq ppq are only locally trivial away from t 0 u on the level of r points they admit similar interpretations to s 1 s only involving 1 pyq 11 pyq for example we have r ppq ppq prq py e f vq y p y prq e a principal g bundle over 1 pyq f a trivialization of e over 11 pyq v an n section of e such that fpvq extends to 1 pyq the fiber of this space over t 0 u is a copy of r while the fibers over y t 0 u y are copies of rp another example is gppqprq py gq y p y prq g 1 pyq g the action of gppq c on r ppq ppq is given as py gq py e f vq py e g f vq z py e f vq pzpy z e z f z vq where for z p r z denotes the pushforward along the multiplication by z endo morphism of xr t zt which transforms 1 pyq into 1 pz pyq the key new feature is that gppq p is a subgroup 24 of gppq c note that the 0 fiber of gppq c r ppq ppq is identified with gpoq c r c acting in the usual way i e with weight 1 on t p o meanwhile the 1 fiber of gppq p r ppq ppq is identified with gpoq p p r p where now p acts in the usual cyclic way of section 2 without any loop rotation this latter identification comes from the defining identification of t 1 u with p warning 3 28 notation r p means mapp p rq this p superscript is not to be confused with the p superscript in r p p where it indicates a set of allowed poles as in rs 1 s 23 that is the or pullback along the p fppf quotient map of the chosen dimension theory on ppq ppq coincides with the pullback along the ind f p closed embedding x x p p p p p of the chosen dimension theory on p p 24

of keeping one copy of r fixed and allowing the other to deform to r p with its cyclic p action we allow both copies of r to deform in that way in fact it is easier because we only need one path we

npoq p ofr p over the base point of gr p and this is sent by the descent isomorphism b construction to the fundamental class of the fiber n ppq of pr ppq ppq q over the base section of gr ppq but this section extends to a base section of grppq namely the trivial g bundle with the trivial trivialization the fiber of r ppq ppq over this section is nppq since this is a vector bundle over y specialization sends its fundamental class to the fundamental class of its zero fiber npoq as required 3 f mod is the frobenius map this is essentially clear from the con struction it amounts to showing that the specialization over y of the class b in h bm gppq 2 rankpt ppq ppq q ppr ppq ppq q q obtained by applying steenrod s construction to a p pa qp 1 q then ap plying descent isomorphism b

the restriction along the twisted diagonal embeddingx x p of the global convolution diagram see appendix to 5 29 rather than gppq p equivariance this is the same as killing since the restriction from

have already used one of these to prove linearity of f in subsection 3 12 2 for large p the n 0 version of a has a name it is 30 the quantum toda lattice denoted toda and given as the two sided quantum hamiltonian reduction n zzd pg q of the rees algebra of crystalline differential operators d pg q of the langlands dual group g over fp with respect to a regular character of a maximal unipotent n g as a quantum hamiltonian reduction of a ring of differential operators it has a canonical frobenius constant structure it follows from a torus localization argument that this frobenius constant structure coincides with the one we have pro duced in this paper the ind f p closed embedding r t induces a pushforward map of h g c p fpq algebras a h bm g c 2 rankt pt fpq h bm g c pgr fpq for all p this map is compatible with the frobenius constant structure for large p this map is an embedding so for large p theorem 3 27 can be understood as saying that the subalgebra a of the quantum toda lattice contains the image of a toda toda under the canonical frobenius constancy map todap 1 q toda 3 an example let g c n c r r 0 then on c points we identify a gr z b t z c rrrtss c r z 0 c

0 this is due to 3 in characteristic p it requires some proof a note will shortly be available 46 gus lonergan it is a direct calculation that f is the map xp 1 q xp yp 1 q bp pxyqp 1 q xpbp p 1 i 0 pxb i q pxbq p p 1 xb as pxbq here y b mod for n c r with r 0 a is the reduction modulo p of the subalgebra of the integral weyl algebra zr sxx by prb xs q with fpr xbs basis x 2 x 1 1 r i 1 prxb i q x 2 r i 1 prxb i q x 2 it satisfies p nr i 1 prxb i qx nqp mr i 1 prxb i qx mq pm nqr i 1 prxb i qx m n note that this is a subalgebra of the mod p weyl algebra if and only if p does not divide r it is again a direct computation that f is the map px 1 qp 1 q x p pprxyqrxqp 1 q pr i 1 prxb i qx p pxyqp 1 q p 1 i 0 pxb i q it is an interesting exercise to check that these are really central of course their images in the mod p weyl algebra are 4 for large p one can prove the centrality and multiplicativity of the map f constructed in subsection 3 11 via torus localization in conjunction with the above example but theorem 3 27 is true for all odd primes p in fact the same construction works for p 2 but one has to be a little careful to account for the fact that a 2 in that case 5 suppose that the action of g on n extends to an action of a normalizing supergroup rg of g then the same proof shows that the corresponding flavor deformation is also a frobenius constant quantization 6 in 5 an algebra ind object of the satake category d b gpoq c pgr cq is constructed its cohomology algebra is the quantum coulomb branch the commutativity of the coulomb branch corresponds to commutativity of the image algebra of in d b gpoq pgr cq it is also possible by essentially the same method given in the appendix to loc cit to tell the same story with fp coefficients in part ii we will use the functor f of theorem 1 3 to upgrade the frobenius constant structure in the same way 4 k theoretic version 4 1 k theory and k homology let x be a scheme over some base b over c and let g be a affine pro smooth groupoid scheme over b acting on x we have the g equivariant k homology of x kgpxq k 0 pd b g cohpxqq which is by definition the grothendieck group of db g cohpxq the g equivariant derived category of complexes of sheaves on x with bounded coherent cohomology sheaves we have also the g equivariant k theory of x kgpxq k 0 pperfgpxqq steenrod operators the coulomb branch and the frobenius twist i 47 which is by definition the grothendieck group of the full subcategory perfgpxq of db g cohpxq consisting of perfect complexes we recall some basic facts see 7 1 kgpxq forms a ring since perfgpxq is monoidal the unit element is given by the class of the structure sheaf 2 kgpxq is a module over kgpxq since d b g cohpxq is a module category over perfgpxq under suitable conditions 31 every equivariant coherent sheaf has a bounded equivariant resolution by vector bundles so that the defining functor perfgpxq d b g pxq is an equivalence and in particular the map from kgpxq to k gpxq is an isomorphism but this will certainly not be the case in most of our examples 3 let f x y be a g equivariant map of schemes over b we have a monoidal pullback map f perfgpy q perfgpxq hence the ring map f kgpy q kgpxq if the derived functor f db g qcohpy q db g qcohpxq sends 32 db g cohpy q to db g cohpxq then we also get a map f kgpy q kgpxq of kgpy q modules 4 if instead the derived functor f d g shpxq d g shpy q sends 33 db g cohpxq to db g cohpy q then we have a map f k gpxq kgpy q of kgpy q modules 5 there is also a version of specialization in equivariant k homology due to 16 let f x b ga be g equivariant map where the factor ga is a multiplicity space ignored by the action of g let i x 0 x denote the inclusion of the fiber of b t 0 u and j xo x denote the inclusion of the complement assume that i is a regular embedding then the map i i on k homology vanishes and so we get a map k gpxq i k gpx 0 q k gpx 0 q note that the restriction map j kgpxq kgpxoq has kernel i k gpx 0 q so we get an injection kgpxq i k gpx 0 q k gpxoq assume that this injection is also a surjection 34 then we have obtained a map s kgpxoq kgpx 0 q which is the promised specialization map 6 there is also a version of restriction with supports suppose f x y is a g equivariant regular closed embedding and g z y is an arbitrary g equivariant map then f ox is isomorphic to an object of perfgpy q so that g f ox is isomorphic 35 to an object of perfgpzq moreover this perfect complex is set theoretically supported on w x y z i e its 31 for instance if x is smooth and g is a connected linear algebraic group 32 for instance f may be flat or a regular closed embedding 33 for instance if f is proper and y is finite type 34 for instance if x is quasi projective 35 without regularity assumption it is just some bounded above equivariant coherent complex 48 gus lonergan restriction to the complement ofw in z is isomorphic to 0 thus tensoring with g f ox gives an exact functor p q bloz g f ox d b g cohpzq d b g cohpzqw the rhs is the full subcategory of db g cohpzq consisting of complexes set theoretically supported on w the pushforward functor db g cohpw q db g cohpzq factors through this category the resulting functordb g cohpw q db g cohpzqw induces 36 an isomorphism in k homology k gpw q k 0 pd b g cohpzqw q thus we have produced a map kgpzq kgpw q which is the promised restriction with supports 7 change of groupoid base restriction of equivariance averaging work exactly as for equivariant borel moore homology see subsection 3 9 the same compatibilities which were used in the previous section to extend the analogous procedures in equivariant borel moore homology to the case of ind schemes hold just as well for equivariantk homology thus we are able to define the k theoretic versions of the coulomb branch and the quantum coulomb branch by using precisely the same underlying geometry we have rings under convolution ka kgpoqprq and kaq k gpoq c prq which receive ring maps from respectively kgpoqp q kgp q rpgq and kgpoq c p q kg c p q rpgqrq q 1 s here rpgq is the integral representation ring of g for a maximal torus t of g we have rpgq zrx pt qsw where w is the weyl group moreover the various compatibilities between specialization and the other procedures hold here as in the case of borel moore homology see subsection 3 9 so that the ring structure on ka may also be defined using specialization on the appropriate beilinson drinfeld grassmannian and is commutative also ka is free over rpgq kaq is free over rpgqrq q 1 s with respect to both left and right multiplication q is in the center zpkaqq of kaq and ka ka 1 kaq q 1 we will show theorem 4 1 fix a positive integer n and a primitive nth root of unity then there is an injective map of algebras ka zpka q here ka kaq npqq where n is the n th cyclotomic polynomial equivalently since kaq is free over zrq q 1 s this is the same as the subalgebra 1 b kaq of c bzrq q 1 skaq where c is the zrq q 1 s algebra whose underlying ring is c and in which q acts as 36 since the embedding w z is f p being the base change of the f p embedding x y steenrod operators the coulomb branch and the frobenius twist i 49 the proof is essentially the same as for the quantum coulomb branch except that remark 4 2 we must generalize from r p r ppq ppq etc to r n r pnq pnq which are defined exactly as before by replacing any instance of p with n indeed we never used that p was prime in any of our previous constructions nor in any of our proofs except for questions of linearity so for instance it is true that we have maps from the mod n rings f n a zpa q which lift the nth power map a a to linearize these maps we have to kill all non unit factors of n if n is not a prime power this means we have to kill every thing so we do not obtain an interesting linear map if n pd is a prime power this amounts to killing p and the resulting map f pd mod p is the composition of f p with the pd 1 q th power of the frobenius endomorphism of a mod p so gives nothing new however the map of theorem 4 1 is a linear map between algebras free over z and is something genuinely different for all q 4 2 adams operations let x b g be as in the previous subsection and n be a positive integer we have a monoidal nonlinear functor st dbgcohpxq d b g n n cohpx nq whose composition with the functor db g n n cohpx nq db g n cohpx nq which forgets the n equivariant structure coincides with the n th external tensor power functor the construction is exactly the same as steenrod s construction of subsec tion 2 2 except we work with coherent complexes rather than constructible ones and with n rather than p proposition 2 3 also holds in this situation with the sole caveat that by is an induced map we mean is a sum of maps induced from various proper subgroups of n rather than only from the trivial subgroup the analogous fact holds also for objects so we get linear maps adn kgpxq kg n npx nq i where i is the subgroup of kg n npx nq spanned by all classes of g n n equivariant complexes induced from g n equivariant complexes for some proper subgroup of n furthermore the functor st preserves perfectness we have st perfgpxq perfg n npx nq and thus linear maps adn kgpxq kg n npx nq j where j is the subgroup of kg n npx nq spanned by all classes of g n n equivariant complexes induced from g n equivariant perfect complexes for some proper subgroup of n in fact j is an ideal by the projection formula i is a j stable submodule for the same reason adn is a map of rings and ad n is a map of adn modules remark 4 3 true adams operations induction commutes with restriction so we have a ring map kgpxq adn kg n npx nq j kg npxq j 1 kgpxqrq q 1 s npqq 50 gus lonergan here j 1 is the subgroup ofkg npxq kgpxqrq q 1 s pqn 1 q spanned by induced classes this equals the ideal generated by the elements d j 1 q nj d for all d 1 dividing n and the lcf of these is npqq by the splitting principle the image of this map is contained in kgpxq kgpxqrq q 1 s npqq the resulting ring endomorphism of kgpxq is the n th adams operation the relevant example for us is with g gpoq x fix a maximal torus t of g then the nth adams operation is identified with the ring map zrx pt qsw zrx pt qsw which sends a w invariant sum i i of characters i to the w invariant sum i ni 4 3 proof of theorem 4 1 the map in question is constructed as in equation 3 1 as the composition 4 1 ka kgpoqprq kgpoq n npr nq i k g pnq nppr pnq pnq q q i 2 k g pnq c ppr pnq pnq q q i 1 kgpoq nprq i 3 ad n descent isomorphism b specialize restrict here 1 i is the ideal of kgpoq n npr nq spanned by all classes induced from kgpoq n n dpr nq for some d 1 dividing n 2 i 1 is the ideal of k g pnq c ppr pnq pnq q q corresponding to i under the descent isomorphism it is equal to the ideal spanned by all classes pushed forward fromk c cg pnq c ppc cr pnq pnq q q for some non trivial c equivariant cover 37 c c 3 i 2 is the image of i 1 under restriction it is the ideal of k g pnq nppr pnq pnq q q spanned by all classes pushed forward from k c cg pnq nppc c r pnq pnq q q for some non trivial c equivariant cover c c note that for the degree d equivariant cover we havek c cg pnq nppc c r pnq pnq q q k g pnq n dppr pnq pnq q q and pushing forward along c c corresponds to inducing from n d equivariance to n equivariance 4 i 3 is the image of i 2 under specialization using the second description 38 of i 2 given above we see that this is the ideal of kgpoq nprq spanned by all classes induced from kgpoq n dprq for some d 1 dividing n 37 recall that in this situation the base copy of c has the action of c of weight n so a c equivariant non trivial cover c c is the dth power map for some d 1 dividing n 38 the first is inapplicable since there is no specialization for k g pnq n ppr pnq pnq q q over the non trivial cover c since n acts non trivially on the base steenrod operators the coulomb branch and the frobenius twist i 51 now on the one hand by the projection formula we see that the composition kgpoq nprq restriction kgpoq n dprq induction kgpoq nprq coincides with multiplication by the class d j 1 q nj d on the other hand it is a con sequence of the cellularity ofr that the restriction of equivariancekgpoq nprq kgpoq n dprq is surjective so the ideal i 3 coincides with the ideal generated by the sums d j 1 q nj d whose lowest common factor is npqq for the same reason the restriction k gpoq c prq kgpoq nprq is also surjective and realizes kgpoq nprq kgpoq c prq pqn 1 q therefore we have produced the map ka kaq npqq ka this map is linear by construction the proof that it is a map of adn algebras and lands in the center is just as for the borel moore homology example 4 4 we return to the situation of subsection 3 15 example 3 we have rpgq zry y 1 s and for n 0 kaq is the zry y 1 q q 1 s algebra opt q q opt q zry y 1 q q 1 sxx x 1 y pyx qxyq for n c r r 0 kaq is given instead by the subalgebra with

primitive nth root of unity it sends p 1 yrqrx to p 1 ynrqrxn n 1 i 0 p 1 yr iqr xn nr 1 i 0 p 1 yr iq xn which is indeed an element of the appropriate subalgebra remark 4 5 f 1 if we set n p d and consider the rings ka kaq npqq mod ulo p then we have pdp 1 q p 0 so that kaq pdpqq becomes a fprqs pdpqq quantization of ka and the map of theorem 4 1 is its frobenius constant struc ture however for other values of n there is no obvious analogue of this fact and already for n a prime power we had to lose some information by killing p in or der to say that our central map lifts some operation of commutative algebra we speculate that on the contrary our map is a lift of some operation of commutative f 1 algebra 39 thus for n 0 it suffices to set qn 1 to obtain such a map why 52 gus lonergan
