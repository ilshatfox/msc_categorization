that it implied his vanishing conjecture which is equivalent to the famous jacobian con jecture we prove various cases of the image conjecture and show that how it leads to another fascinating and elusive assertion that we here dub the factorial conjecture various cases of the factorial conjecture are proved 1 introduction the notion of a mathieu subspace was introduced by coauthor wenhua zhao in 7 inspired by a conjecture of olivier mathieu 3 which was shown by mathieu to imply the famed jacobian conjecture the third author then formulated the image conjecture conjecture 2 1 upon noticing the resemblance of mathieu s conjecture with his own van ishing conjecture which he had shown to be equivalent to the jacobian conjecture 6 he proved that the image conjecture for characteristic zero implies the vanishing con jecture this connection makes the image conjecture a matter of intrigue the reader is referred to 1 for more details on this story we begin by defining a mathieu subspace let k be a field and a a commutative k algebra consider the following two conditions relating to a k vector subspace m of a and an element f of a m 1 fm m for all m 1 and m 2 for any g a we have fmg m for m 0 we will refer to these conditions by their labels m 1 and m 2 throughout this paper definition 1 1 a sub k vector space m of a is called a mathieu subspace if for all f a m 1 implies m 2 2000

the research of the third author was partially supported by nsa grant h 98230 10 1 0168 1 http arxiv org abs 1008 3962 v 2 2 arno van den essen david wright and wenhua zhao it is not difficult to verify that in the definition of mathieu subspace the condition m 1 can be replaced by m 1 fm m for all m 0 and although m 1 appeared in the original definition of mathieu subspace given in 7 the authors have of late been stating the definition using m 1 for the purpose of comparison with the definition of an ideal a proof of the equivalence of the two definitions has been given in proposition 2 1 of 9 we list some basic facts about mathieu subspaces which we leave to the reader to verify 1 a and 0 are mathieu subspaces 2 if m is a mathieu subspace and 1 m then m a 3 any ideal in a is a mathieu subspace 4 the sum m n of two mathieu subspaces is not necessarily a mathieu subspace hint use basic facts 2 and 3 or see example 4 12 in 7 in the next section we will state the image conjecture for which the notion of a mathieu subspace is needed and prove some special cases before we proceed one more definition is in order definition 1 2 for any ring a and variables z 1 zn let l a z 1 zn a be the a linear map defined by l zi i meaning l z 11 z n n 1 n many of the results surrounding the conjecture involve this curious map l which will be at the heart of the factorial conjecture introduced and discussed in section 4 2 the image conjecture the image conjecture formulated by the third author in 8 1 goes as follows conjecture 2 1 image conjecture let k be a field and a be a k algebra and let b a z 1 zn be the polynomial ring in n variables over a for a 1 an a a regular sequence the image of the a linear map bn b defined by d z 1 a 1 zn an is a mathieu subspace in b we will begin by showing the image conjecture is true when k has positive characteristic we are most interested though in the case when k has characteristic zero from which the jacobian conjecture would follow for the characteristic zero case we have only a partial result for n 1 theorem 2 8 below beyond that the image conjecture remains a mystery theorem 2 2 let a be an fp algebra and let b a z 1 zn be the polynomial ring in n variables over a for a 1 an a a regular sequence the image of the a linear map bn b defined by d z 1 a 1 zn an is a mathieu subspace in b 1 the formulation in 8 assumes a is a q algebra however it is more general in its assumption about d see conjecture 1 3 in 8 on the image conjecture 3 remark 2 3 the theorem fails if we drop the hypothesis that a 1 an forms a regular sequence this can be seen in the case n 1 a fp or any field of characteristic p and a 1 0 in that case 1 zz imd but z p 1 imd so imd is not a mathieu subspace by item 2 in the introduction this is example 2 7 in 8 before proving theorem 2 2 we need some preliminary results the first of which is a well known fact about regular sequences lemma 2 4 let a be a ring and let a 1 an be a regular sequence a if g 1 gn a are such that n i 0 aigi 0 then for each pair i j with 1 i j n and i 6 j there exists an element gij a such that gij gji for each pair and gi j 6 i gijaj proof this follows from the exactness of the koszul complex for the sequence a 1 an see 4 18 d for the rest of this section a b a 1 an and d will be as in theorem 2 2 and a will denote the ideal aa 1 aan of a we will write z r for the monomial z r 1 1 z rn n for the very next result a does not need to be an fp algebra lemma 2 5 let g b a z be of degree d with gd its degree d homogeneous summand if g imd then all coefficients of gd belong to the ideal a proof being in the image of d g has the form 1 g n i 1 zi ai hi for some h 1 hn b for 1 i n and any integer m 0 we will denote by hi m the degree m homogeneous summand of hi let e be the maximum of the degrees of h 1 hn since deg g d it is clear from 1 that not all of h 1 hn can have degree strictly less than d so we have e d if e d it follows from 1 that gd n i 1 aihi d and hence that all its coefficients belong to a and we are done if e d then it follows from 1 that n i 1 aihi e 0 we appeal to lemma 2 4 replacing a with b which is innocent since a 1 an is a regular sequence in b as well which asserts the existence of polynomials pij e b for i 6 j such that pij e pji e and hi e j 6 i pij eaj since each hi e is homogeneous of degree e we can replace pij e by its degree e homogeneous summand and assume pij e homogeneous of degree e as well more generally we claim that for m d 1 we have for each pair i j with i 6 j a polynomial pij m homogeneous of degree m and 0 if m e such that pij m pji m and 2 hi m j 6 i pij maj zjpij m 1 note that the preceding paragraph established exactly this for m e with pij e 1 0 as required suppose inductively that the polynomials have been found for larger values of m reading equation 1 in degree m gives 0 n i 1 zihi m 1 aihi m 3 4 arno van den essen david wright and wenhua zhao n i 1 zi j 6 i pij m 1 aj zjpij m 2 aihi m n i 1 zi j 6 i pij m 1 aj aihi m i 6 j zi zjpij m 2 n i 1 zi j 6 i pij m 1 aj aihi m since zi zjpij m 2 zj zipji m 2 n i 1 ai hi m j 6 i zjpij m 1 this uses pij m 1 pji m 1 4 from this equation lemma 2 4 provides polynomials pij m b with pij m pji m such that hi m j 6 i zjpij m 1 j 6 i pij maj which solving for hi m yields 2 finally we complete the proof by reading 1 in degree d which gives gd as the right side of 3 with m d and hence following the same reasoning gd is equal to 4 with m d this shows the coefficients of gd lie in a we now will need to assume that a is an fp algebra corollary 2 6 let f crz r b with cr a if f p imd then c p r a for all r proof the proof will be by induction on the number d of non zero homogeneous summands of f write f f 1 fd where fi are non zero homogeneous summands with deg fi deg fj when i j then f p f p 1 f p d and since fp imd lemma 2 5 says that all coefficients of f p d belong to a and this proves the case d 1 in any case f p d is the sum of monomials of the form caiz pr with c a r r 1 rn r 1 rd deg fd since caiz pr i ai cz rp imd it follows that f p d imd so fp f p d f p 1 f p d 1 imd and the proof is complete by induction lemma 2 7 for all r r 1 rn we have a p i z r imd proof since p i 0 on b we have ai pzr i ai pzr imd with these facts the proof of theorem 2 2 follows quickly proof of theorem 2 2 we will show more strongly that if f b with fp imd then for any g b we have fmg imd when m p 2 let f crz r be such that fp imd by corollary 2 6 we have c p r a hence c p 2 r aa p 1 aa p n for all r since f p 2 c p 2 r z p 2 r it follows that for every g b all coefficients of fmg belong to aa p 1 aa p n if m p 2 therefore fmg imd by lemma 2 7 for characteristic zero the image conjecture is not even completely solved in the case n 1 however the theorem below solves a weak version of this case here z represents only one variable on the image conjecture 5 theorem 2 8 if a is a q algebra and if a a is a non zero divisor such that aa is a radical ideal then the image of d z a is a mathieu subspace in b a z remark 2 9 the proof of this theorem will appeal to a result from section 4 namely theorem 4 9 which says that if f c z z representing one variable and l fm 0 for all m 0 then f 0 an easy use of the lefschetz principle shows that the same holds replacing c by an arbitrary field of characteristic zero in the case where a is a unit in a it can be shown rather easily that imd b hence is a mathieu subspace just note that z a has the inverse map z a 1 a 1 a 1 z 1 a 1 i 0 a i iz which makes sense because z is locally nilpotent therefore we make some preparations in the case a is not a unit in which case i i 1 aa i 6 a for c a i there exists a unique integer m 0 such that c aam aam 1 setting m if c i we call m the a order of c and denote it by va c since a is a non unit in b as well va extends to elements of b which do not lie in i 1 ba i it is clear that an element f of b of the form czi then va f va c in the following proposition d is as in theorem 2 8 here a can be any commutative ring not necessarily a q algebra proposition 2 10 let a a be a non zero divisor let f b 0 b 1 z bdz d a z i if f imd then bd 0 mod a and 5 d bd d 1 bd 1 a d 2 bd 2 a 2 b 0 a d 0 mod ad 1 ii conversely let a be either a q algebra or an fp algebra such that d p if f satisfies 5 then f imd proof for i we can assume bd 6 0 if d 0 the two statements coincide and are easy to prove assume d 1 and g imd so that f z a c 0 c 1 z cdz d note that the polynomial on the inside must have the same degree as that of f since a is not a zero divisor in particular bd acd establishing the first assertion of i and therefore f z a cdz d b 0 bd 2 z d 2 bd 1 dcd z d 1 imd by induction on d we have d 1 bd 1 dcd d 2 bd 2 a b 0 a d 1 0 mod ad multiplying by a and using bd acd gives 5 for ii note that the hypothesis and 5 imply that bd acd for some cd a if d 0 all is clear if d 1 we again have f z a cdz d b 0 bd 2 z d 2 bd 1 dcd z d 1 so f imd if and only if b 0 bd 2 z d 2 bd 1 dcd z d 1 imd by induction it suffices to show d 1 bd 1 dcd d 2 bd 2 a b 0 a d 1 0 mod ad or equivalently since a is a non zero divisor that d 1 bd 1 a dacd d 2 bd 2 a 2 b 0 a d 0 mod ad 1 since acd bd this is precisely the hypothesis now we return to our assumption that a is a q algebra lemma 2 11 an element of b of the form czi lies in the image of d if and only if va c i 1 proof this is immediate from proposition 2 10 6 arno van den essen david wright and wenhua zhao corollary 2 12 let f c 0 c 1 z cdz d b if va ci i 1 for 0 i d then for each g b we have gfm imd for m 0 proof let n deg g and let m n 1 note that each term czj in fm satisfies va c j m hence each term cz j of gfm satisfies va c j m n j 1 by lemma 2 11 each term of gfm and hence gfm itself lies in imd lemma 2 13 let f c 0 c 1 z cdz d b be such that va ci i for 0 i d and for some t d va ct t 1 let f f ctz t if fm imd for some m 1 then f m imd proof writing f m fm h one easily sees that the terms of h satisfy the hypothesis of lemma 2 11 and so we have h imd since fm imd it follows that f m imd proof of theorem 2 8 let f c 0 c 1 z cdz d b be such that fm imd for all m 1 we will show that va ci i 1 for 0 i d which implies imd is a mathieu subspace by virtue of corollary 2 12 suppose to the contrary that va ci i for some i let t be the maximum of the numbers i va ci which by our assumption is non negative let h a tf then for each term czi of h we have va ci i and equality holds for at least one i clearly h m imd for all m 1 using lemma 2 13 to remove the terms for which equality does not hold we arrive at a polynomial f c 0 c 1 z cdz d b with fm imd for all m 1 having the property that va ci i when ci 6 0 we have ci a ibi with bi a and when bi 6 0 we have bi aa letting p biz i we then have f p az for any g z b if g has degree n for some integer n 0 it follows from propo sition 2 10 that g az imd if and only if anl g 0 mod an 1 l as in definition 1 2 noting that fm pm az and deg pm md we thereby conclude amdl pm 0 mod amd 1 for all m 1 since a is not a zero divisor we get l pm 0 mod a for all m 1 let s be the smallest of all i such that bi 6 0 then bs aa we are assuming aa is a radical ideal hence it is the intersection of the prime ideals containing it therefore there is a prime ideal p in a containing aa but not containing bs letting p be the image of p in k z where k is the fraction field of a p we have p 6 0 and l p m 0 but this contradicts theorem 4 9 see remark 2 9 3 specific version of the image conjecture relevant to the vanishing and jacobian conjectures the following specific version of the image conjecture from 8 is of special interest for this we let 1 n and z z 1 zn be two sets of commuting indeterminates and we consider the commuting operators di i zi 1 i n on the polynomial ring a c z we consider the map d d 1 dn a n a conjecture 3 1 special image conjecture the image of d is a mathieu subspace in 8 it is shown that the above conjecture implies the jacobian conjecture 2 more specifically it is shown that it suffices to show that 2 one has to prove the conjecture for all n 1 which then implies the jacobian conjecture for all n 1 on the image conjecture 7 theorem 3 2 8 theorem 3 7 the following two statements are equivalent 1 for any f c z of the form 21 2 n p with p c z and p is homogeneous of degree four then fm imd for all m 1 implies that for each g c z fmg imd for all m 0 2 the jacobian conjecture holds in all dimensions n 1 we now give a realization of the image of d that is established in 8 let e be the c linear map from c z to c z defined by sending a monomial 1 1 n n z 1 1 z n n to 1 z 1 n zn z 1 1 z n n then theorem 3 3 8 theorem 3 1 imd kere this obviously makes it much easier to determine whether an element lies in imd as e is easy to apply we now set m imd kere and make a number of observations letting a c z as above first noting that by theorem 3 3 condition m 1 coincides with e fm 0 for all m 1 in this context we define a multi grading on the polynomial ring c z by setting the multi degree of a monomial i 11 in n z j 1 1 z jn n to be j 1 i 1 jn in we also have the ordinary grading on c z by which 1 n each have degree 1 and z 1 zn each have degree 1 the motivation for these choices is the map e which preserves z 1 zn but converts 1 n to operators which lower degree by one in the discussion below multi degree refers to the former degree refers to the latter with c z viewed as a subring of a c z these gradings restrict to give a multi grading and a grading on c z note that the map e a c z preserves both the multi degree and the degree of a monomial 1 condition m 2 is satisfied if it holds whenever g is a monomial in a 2 we can write any f a as a sum of terms of the form z r 1 1 z rn n q where q has multi degree 0 0 and r 1 rn z n these terms are just the multi homogeneous summands of f any q z of multi degree 0 0 can be written in the form q u 1 un where ui izi for i 1 n 3 if f is multi homogeneous of multi degree r 1 rn in other words if f has the form z r 1 1 z rn n q u 1 un then a if r 1 rn 0 then e f cz r 1 1 z rn n for some c c since e preserves multi degree b if ri 0 for some i then e f 0 note that if b holds for f then it holds for fm for any m 1 hence m 1 holds for f moreover it s easy to see that for any g a b holds for all multi homogeneous terms of fmg for m 0 so m 2 holds for f as well 4 for any f a let nf be the convex polyhedron newton polyhedron in r n determined by the finite set of points r 1 rn which are multi degrees of the nonzero terms z r 1 1 z rn n q u as above appearing in f 8 arno van den essen david wright and wenhua zhao 5 note that if f a is such that there exists i such that the multi degree of all multi homogeneous summands of f have negative i coordinate then again we have e fm 0 for allm 1 and e fmg 0 for all g a m 0 hence f satisfies m 1 and m 2 this condition simply says that nf lies in the half space x 1 xn rn xi 0 6 more generally if there exists a hyperplane h rn through the origin such that the strictly positive n tant x 1 xn r n x 1 xn 0 and nf lie strictly on opposite sides of h then e fm 0 for all m 1 and l fmg 0 for all g a m 0 hence f satisfies m 1 and m 2 this can be seen as follows there is a nonzero vector v v 1 vn r n such that v 1 vn 0 and such that h x rn x v 0 usual inner product then v r 0 for all r nf it follows that for all terms zs 11 z sn n q u 1 un of f m where m 1 we must have v s 0 where s s 1 sn in other words all points on the newton polyhedron of fm lies below h therefore we must have si 0 for some i from which it follows that e fm 0 similarly if g a then for sufficiently large m all points in the newton polyhedron of fmg are below h so that e fmg 0 7 if f a and nf has an extremal point r 1 rn corresponding to the term zrq u z r 1 1 z rn n q u 1 un then the point mr 1 mrn lies on the newton polyhedron of fm from the term zmrq u m z mr 1 1 z mrn n q u 1 un m and in fact is an extremal point thus if f satisfies m 1 so does the multi homogeneous summand zrq u 8 we suspect that it cannot happen that a nonzero multi homogeneous element zrq u with r 1 rn 0 satisfies m 1 if this suspicion is true then by the last item the newton polyhedron of an f a satisfying m 1 cannot have an extremal point in the closed positive n tant x 1 xn r n x 1 xn 0 9 to address the problem in the previous item note that if a multi homogeneous element f zr 11 z rn n q u 1 un satisfies m 1 i e e f m 0 for all m 1 then so does r 11 rn n f u r 1 1 u rn n q u which has multi degree 0 0 thus we need to show that if h c u 1 un and if e h m 0 for all m 1 then h 0 this will be conjecture 4 2 below recall that ui izi one sees that for a monomial u u 1 1 u n n we have e u 1 n thus the map e restricted to c u 1 un is precisely the map l of definition 1 2 in the conjectures below u u 1 un can be taken to be any system of variables forgetting and z for the moment and l c u 1 un c the c linear map sending u to 4 the factorial conjecture it follows from the discussion of the preceding section that the following assertion which draws interest merely by virtue of its simplicity is necessary for the image conjecture to hold conjecture 4 1 the kernel of l c u 1 un c is a mathieu subspace on the image conjecture 9 as per items 8 and 9 above we propose the stronger assertion which we dub the factorial conjecture conjecture 4 2 factorial conjecture let f c u 1 un be such that l f m 0 for all m 1 then f 0 as seen above this conjecture would imply that the newton polyhedron of any f a c z satisfying m 1 has no extremal points in the closed positive n tant the factorial conjecture looks innocent on first glance one would think it is either easy to prove or else a counterexample should be findable however no proof or counterexample has yet been given the authors believe it to be true and will devote quite a bit of effort below in showing that the condition l fm 0 for all m 1 implies f 0 in various situations in this case we say the factorial conjecture holds for f as a first observation let us note that the factorial conjecture holds for f cm where c c and m is a monomial in c u since the condition l f 0 obviously implies c 0 more strongly we have proposition 4 3 the factorial conjecture holds for f c u 1 un of the form c 1 m 1 c 2 m 2 where m 1 m 2 are monomials and c 1 c 2 c more strongly l f l f 2 0 implies f 0 in this case the proof will involve the following observation remark 4 4 the one variable formula 0 uke udu k easily proved inductively using integration by parts leads to the multi variable formula dn uke udu k where uk u k 1 1 u kn n and k k 1 kn du du 1 dun and dn is the non negative n tant u 1 0 un 0 in r n it follows that for f c u 1 un l f can be realized as 6 l f dn f u e udu which incidentally gives a way to calculate l f using a symbolic algebra program such as maple letting be the hermitian inner product defined on c u by 7 f g dn f u g u e udu we note that this restricts to a positive definite form on r u and that l f 2 f f which must be strictly positive if f r u and f 6 0 proof of proposition 4 3 we have l f c 1 l 1 c 2 l 2 0 with l 1 l 2 z 0 so c 2 c 1 l 1 l 2 and f c 1 h where h m 1 l 1 l 2 m 2 q u 0 from remark 4 4 we have 0 l f 2 f f c 1 c 1 h h which shows c 1 0 since h h 0 by symmetry we have c 2 0 so f 0 10 arno van den essen david wright and wenhua zhao now we make two remarks that will be important in several of the proofs that follow 3 the first remark shows that to prove the factorial conjecture we may assume f has coefficients which are algebraic numbers remark 4 5 algebraic reduction given a collection of monomials m 1 md c u where u represents u 1 un we consider whether there exists f 6 0 of the form d i 1 cimi which satisfy l f m 0 for all m 1 thinking of of c 1 cd as indetermi nates we note that l fm is a homogeneous polynomial of degreem in z c 1 cd by the nullstellensatz the existence of a nonzero solution is equivalent to saying the polynomials l fm generate a homogeneous ideal in q c 1 cd whose radical is strictly contained in the ideal generated by the indeterminates c 1 cd which in turn is equivalent to the existence of a nonzero solution over q the algebraic closure of q similarly if f has the form h d i 1 cimi where h is a nonzero polynomial in q u not involving the monomi als m 1 md then consider the ideal generated by the non homogeneous polynomials l fm in q c 1 cd the existence of a solution over c is equivalent to saying this ideal is not all of q c 1 cd which is equivalent to the existence of a solution over q remark 4 6 extension of primes given any c 1 cd q the ring q c 1 cd has a ring extension o in q which is integral over z 1 for some z and we can take o to be a dedekind ring replacing o by its integral closure hence for all but finitely many primes p z specifically those primes not dividing pz extends to a prime ideal of o or equivalently o has a not necessarily unique valuation vp which has positive value at p we will say vp is a valuation lying over p for k z it will then be the case that vp k 0 if and only if p divides k in z proposition 4 7 the factorial conjecture holds for f c u 1 un having the form f mh where m is a monomial and h has nonzero constant term proof suppose such an f has the property l fm 0 for m 1 we can assume the constant term of h is 1 and that h 6 1 then f m c 1 m 1 cdmd where m 1 md are monomials properly divisible by m for any prime p z we have 8 fp mp d i 1 c p im p i p j gj c 1 cd nj where for each j gj c 1 cd z c 1 cd and nj is a monomial divisible by m p write m u m 1 u 1 md u d and nj u j applying l to 8 yields 9 l fp p d i 1 c p i p i p j gj c 1 cd j 0 we make two observations since m properly divides mi we have i so p divides p i in z and moreover p divides p i p in z secondly since m p divides nj p 3 it should be acknowledged that the technique of making reductions using these ideas is due to mitya boyarchenko on the image conjecture 11 divides p j in z dividing 9 by p we get 1 d i 1 c p i p i p p j gj c 1 cd j p 0 which shows that p divides 1 in z c 1 cd however only finitely many primes can be units in z c 1 cd so choosing p to avoid this finite set brings us to a contradiction proposition 4 7 has these two immediate consequences proposition 4 8 the factorial conjecture holds for f c u 1 un having nonzero constant term proof apply proposition 4 7 with m 1 theorem 4 9 the factorial conjecture holds for n 1 proof any nonzero polynomial in one variable has the form f mh of proposition 4 7 the following says something a little different from proposition 4 7 proposition 4 10 the factorial conjecture holds for f c u 1 un of the form cm 0 d i 1 cimi where m 0 u k 1 1 u kn n with k 1 1 and k 1 ki for i 2 n c c 1 cd c with c 6 0 and m 1 md are monomials each divisible by u k 1 1 1 proof assume such an f has the property l fm 0 for m 1 we may assume c 1 and that c 1 cd q by remark 4 5 choose a dedekind overring o of z c 1 cd as in remark 4 6 writing fm m 0 d i 1 cimi m i 0 i 1 id m m i 0 i 1 id c i 1 1 c id d m i 0 0 m i 1 1 m id d mm 0 m i 1 i 1 id i m m i i 1 id c i 1 1 c id d mm i 0 m i 1 1 m id d we have 10 0 l fm l mm 0 m i 1 i 1 id i m m i i 1 id c i 1 1 c id d l mm i 0 m i 1 1 m id d let us note that by our assumption about m 0 mk 1 1 does not divide l m m 0 in z if mk 1 1 is prime also by our assumptions about m 1 md mk 1 1 does divide each of the terms l mm i 0 m i 1 1 m id d appearing in 10 using dirichlet s prime number theorem 4 we can select a prime number p of the form mk 1 1 for which o has a valuation 4 which asserts that for any two positive coprime integers a and b there are infinitely many primes of the form a nb where n 0 see theorem 66 and corollary 4 1 in 2 12 arno van den essen david wright and wenhua zhao vp over p viewing 10 as an equation in o we see that vp takes on positive values at each summand l mm i 0 m i 1 1 m id d for the first term however we have l mm 0 k 1 kn which is not divisible by p in z by our assumption and hence vp l m m 0 0 this gives a contradiction since the sum is 0 proposition 4 11 the factorial conjecture holds for f c u 1 un a power of a linear homogenous form proof we have f gr where g n i 1 ciui we concern ourselves with g for a mo ment for m 0 an integer we have gm i 1 in m m i 1 in c i 1 1 c in n u i 1 1 u in n thus l gm i 1 in m m i 1 im c i 1 1 c in n i 1 im m i 1 in m c i 1 1 c in n let us denote by hm the polynomial i 1 in m c i 1 1 c in n viewing c 1 cn as indeterminates for the moment the polynomials h 1 h 2 c c 1 cn are related to the elementary symmetric poly nomials s 1 sn where sm 1 i 1 im n ci 1 cim in the following way let t be an indeterminate and set s t n i 1 1 cit 1 s 1 t s 2 t 2 1 nsnt n in c c 1 cn t we have s t 1 n i 1 1 1 cit n i 1 1 cit c 2 i t 2 1 h 1 t h 2 t 2 and we let p t be the latter power series now we specialize to c 1 cn c and view s t and p t as elements of c t c t respectively returning to f gr we see that our hypotheses l fm 0 for m 1 says that hmr 0 for m 1 by theorem 4 13 we must have s t 1 i e s 1 sn vanish at c 1 cn it is well known and easily seen that the only zero of s 1 sn is 0 0 so we must have g 0 remark 4 12 in the case where f itself is a linear form one can easily see from the proof that more strongly l f l f 2 l fn 0 implies f 0 theorem 4 13 n mohan kumar let s t c t with constant term 1 and let p t 1 a 1 t a 2 t 2 be it s multiplicative inverse in the power series ring c t if there exists an integer r 0 such that amr 0 for all m 1 then s t 1 proof we note that c t is a free module over b c t r with basis 1 t t r 1 and that c t is free over a c t r with the same basis accordingly we write p t b 0 b 1 t br 1 t r 1 and s t a 0 a 1 t ar 1 t r 1 with b 0 br 1 b and a 0 ar 1 a our assumption about p t clearly shows b 0 1 since the constant term is the only power of t r that has non zero coefficient now we tensor c t and c t with the rational function field k c t r which is the field of fractions of a this gives the containment c t ak c t ak the first ring is the field c t since t is algebraic over c t r which is free over k c t r with basis 1 t t r 1 the second ring is the field of laurent power series ring c t t 1 which is free with the same basis over l c t r a k c t r t r which is the field of laurent power series in on the image conjecture 13 t r so we have s t a 0 a 1 t ar 1 t r 1 1 b 1 t br 1 t r 1 p t a at at r 1 b bt bt r 1 c t k kt kt r 1 l lt lt r 1 since s t lies in the field c t k kt kt r 1 so must its inverse p t and this shows that b 1 br 1 lie in k c t r let q c t r be a common denominator for b 1 br 1 as rational functions in t r then q qp t s t q qb 1 t qbr 1 t r 1 s t since q qb 1 qbr 1 all lie in c t r there is no cancellation amongst summands of q qb 1 t qbr 1 t r 1 hence its degree is at least the degree of q this shows the degree of s t is zero i e s t 1 as desired we have not succeeded in proving that the factorial conjecture holds for more general homogeneous polynomials except in a few situations given below proposition 4 14 the factorial conjecture holds for f c u 1 u 2 a quadratic homoge nous form in two variables proof writing f c 20 u 2 1 c 11 u 1 u 2 c 02 u 2 2 we have fm i j k m m i j k ci 20 c j 11 c k 02 u 2 i j 1 u j 2 k 2 so that l fm i j k m m i j k ci 20 c j 11 c k 02 2 i j j 2 k 0 i k m m i m i k k ci 20 c k 02 c m i k 11 m i k m i k 0 11 let m be the sum of the terms in above where k i i e m 0 2 i m m i 2 m 2 i m 2 c 20 c 02 icm 2 i 11 by the integrality reduction remark 4 5 we can assume c 20 c 11 c 02 lie in a ring o which is dedekind and integral over z 1 for some z 6 0 let p 2 r 1 z be an odd prime which corresponds to a valuation in o and consider the above equations with m 2 r let us note that p divides all of the summands of 11 except those comprised 14 arno van den essen david wright and wenhua zhao by m i e those for which k 6 i for if say i k then p m i k thus we have l fm m mod p from lemma 4 15 below we get 0 m r i 0 r i c 2 r 2 i 11 4 c 20 c 02 i c 211 4 c 20 c 02 r mod p hence p divides c 211 4 c 20 c 02 r in o this shows that d c 211 4 c 20 c 02 has a positive valuation for infinitely many valuations of o which shows that d 0 since d is the discriminant of f we conclude that f is the square of a linear form in c u 1 u 2 so we are in the situation of proposition 4 11 and the proof is complete modulo the lemma below lemma 4 15 for p 2 r 1 z an odd prime we have setting m 2 r m 3 i 2 m 2 i r i 4 i mod p for 0 i r proof we have m 1 mod p by wilson s theorem 5 so it remains to prove that 12 i 2 r 2 i r r i 4 i 1 mod p to see this we begin with the expression on the left i 2 r 2 i r r i 4 i i 2 r 2 i r r 1 r i 1 2 i 2 i i 2 r 2 i 2 r 2 r 2 2 r 2 i 2 2 i i 2 r 2 r 1 2 r 3 2 r 2 i 1 2 i i p 1 p 2 p 4 p 2 i 2 i i 1 2 4 2 i 2 i going mod p and again appealing to wilson s theorem i 1 i 2 i 2 i 1 proposition 4 16 the factorial conjecture holds for f c u 1 un of the form c 1 u d 1 cnu d n where d 1 5 wilson s theorem an integer n 1 is prime if and only if n 1 1 mod n see 5 for a very nice survey on this on the image conjecture 15 proof the case d 1 is covered in proposition 4 11 so we assume d 2 and each of c 1 cn is non zero here we only need to assume that l f m 0 for m 0 we consider the powers fnm of f fnm k 1 kn nm nm k 1 kn c k 1 1 c kn n u k 1 d 1 u knd n which yields l fnm k 1 kn nm nm k 1 kn c k 1 1 c kn n k 1 d knd nm k 1 kn nm k 1 d k 1 knd kn c k 1 1 c kn n 13 one term of 13 we ll call it the special term occurs when k 1 kn m for all other summands we have ki m for some i since ki nm and we now examine one of these other summands without loss of generality suppose k 1 m and write k 1 d k 1 k 1 d k 1 k 1 d 1 k 1 d d 1 k 1 1 d k 1 1 k 1 d d 1 2 d 1 2 d 2 2 d 1 d 1 1 d d d 1 1 from this one easily sees that k 1 d k 1 is an integer divisible by p m 1 d 1 which by dirichlet s prime number theorem is prime for infinitely many values of m as in previous arguments we apply the algebraic reduction remark 4 5 and let o be the dedekind ring chosen as in remark 4 6 for all but finitely many such p o has a valuation vp lying over p the above observation shows then shows that vp is positive at all the terms of 13 except the special term and since l fnm 0 it must be positive at the special term as well since p m 1 d 1 does not divide k 1 d k 1 knd kn when k 1 kn m we must have vp c m 1 c m n 0 and since this holds for infinitely many valuations of o we conclude cm 1 c m n 0 therefore ci 0 for some i contradicting our assumption references 1 arno
