dancheng lu department of mathematics suzhou university suzhou 215006 p r china abstract a local ring r is called z local if j r z r and j r 2 0 in this paper the structures of a class of z local rings are determined key words z local ring structure polynomial rings let r be a commutative local ring which is not necessarily noetherian denote by j r the jacobson radical of r z r the zero divisor elements of r r is called z local if j r z r and j r 2 0 this concept was introduced in 2 where the authors proved that for any commutative ring s such that 2 is regular in s and that s satisfies dcc on principle ideals if the zero divisor graph s of s is uniquely determined by neighborhoods and s is not a boolean ring then s is a z local ring the zero divisor graph of a commutative ring was introduced and studied in 1 in this paper we will try to determine the structure of a class of z local rings for any commutative ring extension a b and any b recall that is said to be integral over a if there is a monic polynomial f x a x such that f 0 it is well known that is integral over a if and only if there is a subring c of b which contains a such that c and c is finitely

minimal polynomial of over a is a monic polynomial f x with the least degree such that f 0 in general a minimal polynomial over a need not be unique but if a is a field then it is unique if a zp 2 for some prime number p then the minimal polynomial of over zp 2 is unique modulo p that is p divides all the coefficients of f x g x for any minimal polynomials f x and g x of over zp 2 in this case we will denote it as f x g x mod p these observations will be used in the latter part of the paper by 2 theorem 2 5 the characteristic of a z local ring has only three possible values i e 0 p or p 2 for a z local ring r with characteristic 0 since any element of a z local ring is either a unit or a zero divisor we have q t r r theorem 1 for a z local ring r let f be the prime subfield of the field k r j r assume that the characteristic of the ring r is not p 2 for any prime number p assume further that k f is an algebraic extension over f for some r and let g x be the minimal polynomial of over f with degree n let s si i i be the k basis of the k module j r 1 there is an f algebra epimorphism from f x y yiyj i j i to r where y yi i i is a set of commutative indeterminants 2 if is integral over f then one and only one situation occurs in the following i if g 0 then r k y yiyj i j i where g x is irreducible over f and m 1 ii if g 6 0 then assume g m i 1 vi si where vi 6 j r then r f x y g x 2 g x m i 1 vi x yi g x yr ysyt r s t i notice that in the second case m 2 g x is irreducible over f with degree at least 2 and vi x are nonzero polynomials over f and deg vi x n proof 1 by assumption we have f r since f j r j r f r j r we have r f j r now consider the f algebra homomorphism f x y yiyj i j i r f j r h x yi 7 h si 2 by assumption s is the set of generators of the r module j r since j r 2 0 r f j r thus is a surjective f algebra homomorphism this proves the first part of the theorem 2 now assume further that is integral over f let g x f x be the minimal monic polynomial of over f and assume deg g x n let f x be the minimal monic polynomial of over f then g x is irreducible in f x and we have g x f x now assume f x g x u l x where l x g x 1 since g j r thus l u r by assumption we must have f x g x u where u 2 case 1 if u 1 then in r we have g 0 by assumption for each nonzero polynomial r x of degree less than n n deg g x we have r 6 j r i e r is invertible in r thus r f j r where f is a field and it is also a subring of r in this case we obviously have an f algebra isomorphism r k y yiyj i j i case 2 if u 2 then g 6 0 and g j r in this case consider f x y w r h x yi 7 h si where w g x 2 g x m i 1 vi x yi g x yr ysyt r s t i by assumption is a map and thus a surjective f algebra homomorphism in order to prove that is injective for any h x yi f x y we have h x yi g x 2 a i j yiyjbij r g x qr x fr x yr g x q x f x where the degrees of qd x and fe x are at most n 1 whenever they are not zero by assumption qd and fe are units of r when the corresponding polynomials are not zero then if h si 0 then we must have 0 r fr sr g q f now if f x 6 0 then f is a unit but from the previous equality we also obtain f j r a contradiction thus by assumption and we obtain r fr sr q m i 1 vi si 3 thus for r 6 1 2 m fr x must be zero or else it is a unit and at the same time it is in j r for r 1 2 m we have fr q vr since f x g x 2 we obtain fr x q x vr x now coming back to the previous decomposition of h x yi we obtain r fr x yr g x q x q x g x m i 1 vi x yi this shows that is injective this completes the whole proof now let r be a z local ring with char r p 2 for some prime number p then i 0 i p 2 1 zp 2 r denote by f the prime subfield zp of the field k r j r and let s p be a set of k basis of the k space j r where p 6 s and s si i i let y yi i i be a set of indeterminants determined by the index set i assume further that k f is an algebraic extension over f for some r and let g x be the minimal polynomial of over f with degree n where g x zp 2 x is a monic polynomial we also observe the following facts which will be used repeatedly for any polynomial u x zp 2 x if u x 6 0 mod p and its degree modulo p is less than n then u is a unit of r we are now ready to determine the structure of a class of z local rings with characteristic p 2 theorem 2 for a z local ring r with characteristic p 2 assume that r j r k f is an algebraic extension over zp f r j r for some r assume further that is integral over zp 2 then either r zp 2 x y q 1 where q 1 q g x and y 0 or r zp 2 x y q 2 where q 2 q g x 2 pg x g x yr g x m i 1 vi x yi r i in each case g x is irreducible over zp and q px ysyt pyr r s t i where m 1 is a fixed number and vi x 6 0 mod p we also notice that in the second case g x is some polynomial over zp 2 such that deg g x 1 proof first it is easy to see that r zp 2 j r since is integral over zp 2 we have a minimal polynomial f x zp 2 x which is unique modulo p by the choice of g x we have f x g x ur x mod p for some monic r x zp 2 x 4 satisfying g x r x 1 in f x thus r is invertible in r since g j r without loss of generality we can assume f x g x ur x h x where h x 0 mod p if u 3 then we obtain 0 f g ur h h thus the monic polynomial g x 2 r x annilates and it has a degree less than degf x contradicting to the choice of f x thus we must have u 2 case 1 if u 2 we have h 0 again in this case we must have r x 1 since g x 2 annilates in this case we can choose f x g x 2 case 2 if u 1 we have f x g x r x h x where h x 0 mod p in this case we have g h r 1 h w for some w x zp 2 x obviously g x g x h x w x mod p thus in this case we can choose the g x such that g 0 1 let us first consider the case when g 0 in this case consider f x y q 1 r f j r h x yi 7 h si for each generators h x yi of q 1 we have h si 0 thus is a surjective f algebra homomorphism now for any h x yi f x y we have a decomposition h x yi r fr x yr f x mod q 1 where fr x are some polynomials of x over f which has degree less than n when they are nonzero modulo p for all s 6 if in f x y q 1 h x yi 6 0 then either one of the fs x is not zero modulo p or f x 6 0 thus if f x 0 then we have some unit fs and hence h si 6 0 if f x 6 0 we also conclude that h si 6 0 in fact assume in the contrary that h si 0 if deg f x 0 with coefficients modulo p then f j r u r a contradiction if f x 6 0 and deg f x 0 then we need only consider the case when f pi mod px for some 1 i p 1 since px q 1 then we obtain a contradiction i p r fr sr 0 since p 6 s these arguments show that is injective in conclusion is an f algebra isomorphism under the assumption of g 0 2 now assume g 6 0 then g 2 0 and pg 0 since g j r since this case corresponds to the case of f x g x 2 we can choose an g x such that g m i 1 vi si where vi u r in this case consider f x y q 2 r h x yi 7 h si 5 by the choice ofq 2 it is easy to see that is a map and thus a surjective f algebra homomorphism in order to prove that is injective for any h x yi f x y we have h x yi r fr x yr g x q x f x mod q 2 where the degrees of q x and fr x are at most n 1 whenever they are not zero modulo p by assumption q and fr are units of r when the corresponding polynomials are not zero modulo p r 6 if h si 0 then we must have 0 r fr sr g q f subcase 1 if f x 0 then by assumption and we obtain r fr sr q m i 1 vi si thus for r 6 1 2 m fr x must be zero modulo p or else fr is a unit and at the same time it is in j r for r 1 2 m we have fr q vr mod j r since f x g x 2 we obtain fr x q x vr x modulo p now coming back to the previous decomposition of h x yi we obtain r fr x yr g x q x q x g x m i 1 vi x yi 0 mod q 2 subcase 2 if f x 6 0 then deg f x 0 modulo p or else f j r u r by a contradiction in the following we assume f x 6 0 and deg f x 0 with coefficients modulo p now consider and assume f x pi mod px for some 1 i p 1 we have i p r fr sr q g since i is invertible in r p can be written as an r combination of the si s this is certainly impossible the above arguments show that is injective this completes the whole proof it is well known that any finite field is a simple algebraic extension over it s prime subfield zp for some prime number p as an application of theorem 2 we immediately obtain the following results theorem 3 let r be a finite ring whose characteristic is a prime square p 2 then r is a z local ring if and only if either r zp 2 x y 1 ym g x px ysyt pyr 1 r s t m 6 for some polynomials g x zp 2 x such that g x is irreducible over zp or r zp 2 x y 1 ym m for some m g x 2 pg x g x yr px ysyt pyr g x m i 1 vi x yi 1 r s t m where g x is some polynomial over zp 2 such that deg g x 1 and that g x is irreducible over zp and at least one of the vi x is not zero modulo p while deg vi x is less than deg g x finally we remark that each ring of the four types in theorem 1 and theorem 2 is obviously a z local ring we also remark that not all finite local rings whose zero divisor graph is uniquely determined are z local for example each of z 2 x 1 x 2 xn x 2 1 x 2 2 x 2 n and z 4 x 1 x 2 xn x 2 1 x 2 2 x 2 n is a finite local rings with the property that j s z s and x 2 0 x z s obviously they are not z local references 1
