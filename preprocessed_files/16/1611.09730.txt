of an ambiskew polyno mial algebra r over an algebraically closed field k to be akin to those of two of the principal examples of such an algebra namely the universal enveloping algebra u sl 2 in character istic 0 and its quantization uq sl 2 when q is not a root of unity more precisely we determine sufficient criteria for the prime spectrum of r to consist of 0 the ideals z r for some central element z of r and all k and for some positive integer d and each positive integer m d height two prime ideals p for which r p has goldie rank m 1 introduction the results of this paper are applicable to the determination of the prime ideals of certain ambiskew polynomial algebras and generalized weyl algebras for readers unfamiliar with these algebras details appear at the end of this introduction the main results of 12 are simplicity criteria for an ambiskew polynomial algebra r over a field k and in cases where r is not itself simple certain localizations and factors of r including generalized weyl algebras such results are applicable to the analysis of the prime spectrum of an ambiskew polynomial ring or of any ring which has an ambiskew polynomial ring as a localization our aim is to prove results that can be applied together to show that under appropriate conditions the prime spectrum of a given algebra r over an algebraically closed field k meets the following description 0 is a prime ideal there exists z z r the centre of r such that the height one prime ideals have the form z r k z r is maximal for all but countably many values of and there is a positive integer d such that for each m 1 r has d height two prime ideals p for which r p has goldie rank m it is well known that the prime spectra of the universal enveloping algebra u sl 2 in char acteristic 0 and the universal quantized enveloping algebra uq sl 2 when q is not a root of unity fit the description with d 1 and 2 respectively these two algebras are among the main examples of ambiskew polynomial rings they are well understood and will serve to illustrate our results the new application will be to certain ambiskew polynomial rings over coordinate rings of quantum tori which arise as localizations in our analysis of connected 2010 mathematics subject classification primary 16 s 36 secondary 16 d 25 16 d 30 16 n 60 16 w 20 16 w 25 16 u 20 key words and phrases skew polynomial ring

be introduced in example 2 8 we shall see that the prime spectrum fits the description with d 2 this is applied in 6 to the determination of the prime spectra of connected quantized weyl algebras the first step in establishing for a domain is to identify an appropriate central element z for which the localization of r at k z 0 is simple this will be done in section 2 using the notion of a casimir element for an ambiskew polynomial ring when such elements exist they are normal but not necessarily central 12 theorem 4 7 is a simplicity criterion for the localization of r at the powers of z if z is central then this localization is never simple and the appropriate localization for which to consider simplicity is at k z 0 in proposition 2 2 we give sufficient conditions for this localization to be simple as the localization is central all ideals of r extend to ideals of the localization and simplicity of the localization is equivalent to the property that every non zero ideal r has non zero intersection with k z proposition 2 9 generalizes proposition 2 2 to a situation where there is a central polynomial subalgebra k z c 1 ct of r for some t 0 this general result will be applied with t 1 to show that the augmented down up algebras of 16 have the property that every non zero ideal has non zero intersection with the centre which for these algebras is a polynomial algebra in two indeterminates having completed the first step we proceed in section 3 to analyse prime spectra of the factors r z r for k for description to hold we need all but countably many of these to be simple these factors are generalized weyl algebras w a u in the sense of 1 and we apply known simplicity criteria 2 12 for w a u to give in corollary 3 2 sufficient conditions involving a positive integer parameter m for r z r to be simple we then proceed to give in corollary 3 14 sufficient conditions for r z r to have a unique non zero prime ideal p z r in section 4 under mild extra conditions we show that the parameter m is the right goldie rank of r p for the unique prime ideal p z r of r z r when it exists in the motivating examples arising from quantum tori it turns out that for each m 1 there are precisely two values of for which r z r is not simple and for each of these values of r z r has a unique non zero prime ideal for u sl 2 and the quantized enveloping algebra uq sl 2 the exceptional maximal ideals are annihilators of finite dimensional simple modules but this is not the case for the examples over quantum tori where the factors are infinite dimensional in the remainder of the introduction we give some reminders of the construction and properties of ambiskew polynomial rings and generalized weyl algebras definitions 1 1 let k be a field and let a be a k algebra for convenience we shall assume that k is algebraically closed let k 0 and let v be a central element of a let autka and let 1 extend to a k automorphism of a y by setting y y there is a derivation of a y such that a 0 and y v the ambiskew polynomial algebra r a v is the iterated skew polynomial algebra a y x thus ya a y and xa a x for all a a and xy yx v more general versions of ambiskew polynomial algebras are considered in 12 where v need not be central and need not be 1 and 10 where need not be bijective but here we consider only the case specified above if there is a central element u a such that v u u then the element z xy u yx u is such that zy yz zx 1 xz and za az for all a a hence z is 2 normal in r i e zr rz and it is central if and only if 1 if such an element u exists then it is called a splitting element and we say that r is a conformal ambiskew polynomial algebra we then refer to the element z as the casimir element of r if 1 then u and z are not unique and for any k can be replaced by u and z respectively let v 0 0 and v m m 1 l 0 l l v for m n in particular v 1 v each v m is central and it is easily checked by induction that for m 0 xym mymx v m ym 1 and 1 xmy myxm xm 1 v m 1 m v m xm 1 2 if u is a splitting element then v m u m m u definitions 1 2 1 let a be a ring be an automorphism of a with inverse and u be a central element of a the generalized weyl algebra w a u is generated as a ring extension of a by x and y subject to the relations y x u xy u and for all a a y a a y and xa a x here a and will be a k algebra and a k automorphism respectively if r is the conformal ambiskew polynomial ring r a u u 1 with casimir element z then we may identify w a u with r zr x with x zr and y with y zr the algebra w w a u has a z grading in which w 0 a and for i 0 wi ay i and w i ax i if a is a domain then by the z grading so too for each k is w a u r z r hence if a is a domain z r is a completely prime ideal of r for all k it is easy to check inductively that for all m 1 xmy m m 1 i 0 i u and y mxm m i 1 i u as observed in 12 notation 5 3 the isomorphic skew laurent polynomial rings a y 1 and a x 1 1 are the localizations of w at the ore sets y i i 1 and x i i 1 respectively remark 1 3 the numbering of results in this version is different to that in the previous version cited in 6 the references in 6 to example 3 12 and corollary 4 7 would in the current numbering be to example 3 17 and corollary 4 10 respectively 2 simple central localizations the following lemma which in the noetherian case is an immediate consequence of 14 2 1 16 vi is a generalization of 12 lemma 3 1 lemma 2 1 let b be a ring let y be a regular element of b such that y yi i 1 is a right and left ore set and let z be a multiplicatively closed set of central elements of b let w yiz i 1 z z which a right and left ore set and let c bw be the localization of b at w if c is simple and i is a non zero ideal of b then ysz i for some s 0 and some z z proof note that c bz y it follows easily from the centrality of z that ibz is an ideal of bz by 12 lemma 3 1 y s ibz for some s 0 by 14 2 1 16 iv y sz i for some z z 3 proposition 2 2 let r be a conformal ambiskew polynomial ring of the form r a v 1 where a is a k algebra and v a is central let u be a splitting element with corresponding casimir element z xy u and let z be the multiplicatively closed set of central elements k z 0 suppose that a y 1 is simple and that z a y 1 k then rz is simple if and only if for all m 1 there exists a non zero polynomial pm x k x such that pm u v m a proof assume that for all m 1 there exists a non zero polynomial pm x k x such that pm u v m a let y yi i 0 and let w y mq z m 1 q z z by the centrality of z w is a right and left ore set in r and rw ry z rz y we first show that rw is simple the argument in 7 1 5 where a is commutative is valid more generally and shows that y is a right and left ore set in r and ry a y 1 z as a y 1 is simple and z a y 1 k it follows from 14 lemma 9 6 9 with v k z that rw is simple now suppose thatrz is not simple letm 6 0 be a maximal ideal ofrz and let p m r then z p and p 6 0 using the centrality of z it is easy to check that p is a prime ideal of r and that q z is regular modulo p for all q z z by lemma 2 1 and the simplicity of rw y jq z p for some j 0 and some q z z hence yj p and there exists a minimal m 0 such that ym p suppose that m 1 by assumption there exists a non zero polynomial pm x k x such that pm u v m a by 1 v m ym 1 p whence v m aym 1 p and pm u y m 1 p as u and xy commute z i u xy i ui mod ry for i 0 and hence pm z pm u mod ry therefore pm z y m 1 pm u y m 1 mod rym and so as pm u y m 1 p and ym p we see that pm z y m 1 p the regularity of pm z modulo p then gives that ym 1 p contradicting the minimality of m thus m 0 1 p and m w this contradiction shows that rz is simple conversely suppose that rz is simple let m 1 as in the proof of 12 lemma 4 1 let j be the k subspace of r spanned by the elements of the form xiayj where i 0 or j m or a v m a then j is a right ideal of r and i annr r j is an ideal of r contained in j and containing ym note that j a v m a as z is central irz is a non zero ideal of the simple ring rz so by 14 proposition 2 1 16 iv it follows that pm z i for some non zero polynomial pm x k x thus pm u xy j and as x j and uxy xyu j it follows that pm u j a v m a remark 2 3 in proposition 2 2 the hypotheses that z a y 1 k and a y 1 is simple can be rephrased in terms of the base ring a using 14 theorem 1 8 5 it is easy to check that these conditions are equivalent to the following three conditions i a is simple ii n is outer for all positive integers n iii a z a a a k corollary 2 4 let r be a conformal ambiskew polynomial ring of the form r a u u 1 where u is central and the k algebra a is a domain such that a y 1 is simple z a y 1 k and for all m 1 there exists a non zero polynomial pm x k x such that pm u v m a then the height one prime ideals of r are the ideals of the form z r k where z is the casimir element xy u consequently r is a ufd in the sense of 4 4 proof by proposition 2 2 the localization of r at k z 0 is simple as z is central and k is algebraically closed it follows from lemma 2 1 with y 1 that every non zero prime ideal of r contains z r for some k as observed in 1 2 z r is completely prime for each k so the result follows we can apply proposition 2 2 to obtain alternative proofs of known results including 7 theorem 4 6 and 15 theorem 3 2 corollary 2 5 let a be either i k t where t t for some k and char k 0 or ii k t 1 where t qt for some q k that is not a root of unity let u a k and let r r a u u 1 then the height one prime ideals of r are the ideals of the form z r k where z is the casimir element xy u and every non zero ideal of r has non zero intersection with k z proof it is well known that in both cases a is simple and it is clear that conditions ii and iii of remark 2 3 hold hence a y 1 is simple and z a y 1 k for m 1 v m u m u 6 0 so the k algebra a v m a is finite dimensional u v m a is algebraic over k and there exists a non zero polynomial pm x k x such that pm u v m a by corollary 2 4 the height one prime ideals of r are the ideals of the form z r k and r being noetherian it follows that every non zero ideal of r has non zero intersection with k z in the following two examples we give details of the best known examples of cases i and ii of corollary 2 5 they are included to illustrate our results rather than to advance understanding of the examples we shall need to know the values of the elements v m m 1 example 2 6 assume that char k 0 let a be the polynomial algebra k t and let be the k automorphism of a such that t t 2 let 1 and let u 1 4 t 1 2 so that v t then r a v 1 is the enveloping algebra u sl 2 in which x y and t are usually written e f and h in the notation of definitions 1 1 the casimir element z is 1 4 1 where is the usual casimir element as for example in 5 for m 1 v m m t m 1 in accordance with proposition 2 2 and corollary 2 5 the localization of r at k z 0 is simple example 2 7 let q k and suppose that q is not a root of unity let a be the laurent polynomial algebra k t 1 and let be the k automorphism of a such that t q 2 t again it is well known that a is simple let 1 and let u q 1 t qt 1 q q 1 2 and that v u u t t 1 q q 1 here r a v 1 is the quantum enveloping algebra uq sl 2 for example see 3 chapter i 3 where as usual x y and t are written e f and k the casimir element z is xy q 1 t qt 1 q q 1 2 and for m 1 v m q 2 m 1 q 1 t q 1 2 m q t 1 q q 1 2 in accordance with proposition 2 2 and corollary 2 5 the localization of r at k z 0 is simple note that the version of uq sl 2 considered in 7 example 2 3 is different to the now established one considered here 5 in the next example which occurs as a localization of a connected quantized weyl algebra in 6 a is noncommutative if p 6 1 and the results of 7 8 on height one prime ideals do not apply example 2 8 let p be an odd positive integer and let q k suppose that q is not a root of unity let a be the quantum torus with generators z 1 i 1 i p subject to the relations zizj qijzjzi for 1 j i p where for i j qij 1 if i is odd or if i and j are both even q 1 if i is even and j is odd note that zp is central in a let be the k automorphism of a such that for 1 i p zi zi if i is even and zi q 1 zi if i is odd the skew laurent polynomial ring s a y 1 is a quantum torus in p 1 generators z 1 i 1 i p 1 where zp 1 y it follows from 13 proposition 1 3 that s is simple and has centre k see 6 lemma 3 7 for more detail let v 1 q q p 1 2 z 1 p zp z a and observe that v u u where u q p 1 2 z 1 p qzp thus r r a v 1 is conformal with casimir element z xy u let m 1 then v m u m u 1 qm q p 1 2 z 1 p q 1 mzp so z 2 p q p 2 m 3 2 mod v m a and z 2 p q p 2 m 3 2 mod v m a hence u 2 qp 1 z 2 p 2 q p 1 2 q 2 z 2 p q p 1 2 q m 2 qm mod v m a thus pm u v m a where pm x x 2 and q p 1 2 q m 2 qm by proposition 2 2 every non zero prime ideal of r has non zero intersection with k z and by corollary 2 4 every height one prime ideal has the form z r k the next result is a generalization of proposition 2 2 which is the case t 0 and is applicable to other algebras in which every ideal intersects the centre non trivially proposition 2 9 let b be a k algebra with a k automorphism such that b y 1 is simple and z b y 1 k let t 0 be an integer and let a be the polynomial algebra b c 1 ct in t algebraically independent commuting indeterminants extend to a k automorphism of a by setting ci ci for 1 i t let u a let v u u and in the conformal ambiskew polynomial ring r r a v 1 let z be the casimir element xy u i z a y 1 k c 1 ct and z r is the polynomial algebra k z c 1 ct ii let z z r 0 the localization rz is simple if and only if for allm 1 there exists a non zero polynomial pm x x 1 xt k x x 1 xt such that pm u c 1 ct v m a 6 proof i is straightforward ii we adapt the proof of proposition 2 2 with y yi i 0 ry a y 1 z b y 1 z c 1 ct w y mq z c 1 ct m 1 q z c 1 ct z and rw ry z rz y which is simple assume that for all m 1 there exists a non zero polynomial pm x x 1 xt k x x 1 xt such that pm u c 1 ct v m a suppose that rz is not simple let m 6 0 be a maximal ideal of rz and let p m r then z p p 6 0 and using the central ity of z it is easy to check that p is a prime ideal of r and that q z c 1 ct is regular mod ulo p for all q z c 1 ct z by lemma 2 1 and the simplicity of rw y jq z c 1 ct p for some j 0 and some q z c 1 ct z hence y j p let m 0 be is minimal such that ym p as p is proper m 1 by assumption there exists a non zero polynomial pm x x 1 xt k x x 1 xt such that pm u c 1 ct v m a as in the proof of proposition 2 2 pm u c 1 ct y m 1 p pm z c 1 ct pm u c 1 ct mod ry pm z c 1 ct y m 1 pm u c 1 ct y m 1 mod rym pm z c 1 ct y m 1 p and ym 1 p contradicting the minimality of m it follows that rz is simple conversely suppose that rz is simple let m 1 as in the proof of proposition 2 2 if j denotes the k subspace of r spanned by the elements of the form xiayj where i 0 or j m or a v m a then j is a right ideal of r and i annr r j is an ideal of r contained in j and containing ym also j a v m a as z is central irz is a non zero ideal of the simple ring rz so by 14 proposition 2 1 16 iv it follows that pm z c 1 ct i for some non zero polynomial pm x x 1 xt k x x 1 xt thus pm u xy c 1 ct j and as x j and uxy xyu j it follows that pm u c 1 ct j a v m a we next look at a class of algebras introduced by terwilliger and worawannotai 16 to which proposition 2 9 applies with t 1 example 2 10 let a k c k 1 let q k and suppose that q is not a root of unity let be the k automorphism such that k q 2 k and c c fix a non zero integer n and a laurent polynomial f k aik i k k k 1 such that an 0 let u ckn f k and v u u 1 q 2 n ckn bik i where each bi 1 q 2 i ai in particular b 0 0 then r r a v 1 is generated by k 1 c x and y subject to the relations ck kc xc cx yc cy 3 kk 1 1 k 1 k 4 xk q 2 kx yk q 2 ky 5 xy yx 1 q 2 n ckn bik i 6 by 6 c 1 q 2 n 1 xy yx bik i k n so as a generator c is redundant substituting the above expression for c in the relations xc cx and cy yc gives two relations in x y and k that are cubic in x y then r is 7 generated by k 1 x and y subject to these two relations and kk 1 1 k 1 k 7 xk q 2 kx yk q 2 ky 8 xy yx 1 q 2 n ckn bik i 9 this corresponds to the presentation in 16 definition 2 1 but the generators there are e q tksx and f y where t s n following 16 we shall refer to r as an augmented down up algebra by the construction above r is conformal with central casimir element z xy u and it is readily checked that z r k c z for m 1 v m 1 qmn ckn 1 q 2 im aik i so a v m a k k 1 which is an integral domain of transcendence degree 1 hence there exists a non zero polynomial p x y k x y such that p u c v m a applying propo sition 2 9 we obtain the following result proposition 2 11 if r is an augmented down up algebra then every non zero ideal of r has non zero intersection with z r and the localization of r at z r 0 is simple corollary 2 12 an augmented down up algebra r is a ufd in the sense of 4 proof certainly r is a domain it follows from proposition 2 2 that if p is a height one prime ideal of r then f p for some irreducible element f k c z it remains to show that fr is completely prime by 11 corollary 2 6 r is isomorphic to the generalized weyl algebra w w b u where b k c k 1 z c c k q 2 k and z z applying lemma 2 13 below with i fb we see that r fr is a generalized weyl algebra over the domain b fb and hence is a domain lemma 2 13 let w w a u be a generalized weyl algebra and let i be an ideal of a such that i i then iw is an ideal of w and w iw w a i u where is the automorphism of a i induced by and u u i proof it is routine to check that an isomorphism is given by aiy i a 0 a jx j iw 7 aiy i a 0 a jx j where for i z ai ai i 3 families of exceptional simple factors although the results of this section are more widely applicable they are aimed at the case where r satisfies the hypotheses and the simplicity criterion of proposition 2 2 examples include examples 2 6 2 7 and 2 8 we continue to assume that k is algebraically closed so that every height one prime ideal p of r has the form z r with k the factor r z r is then the generalized weyl algebra w a u and the following result from 2 is applicable an earlier version appeared in 9 where a is commutative and a more general version is 12 theorem 5 4 theorem 3 1 let be a k automorphism of an k algebra a let u a be central and let w be the generalized weyl algebra w a u then w is simple if and only if 8 i a is simple ii m is outer for all m 1 iii u is regular iv ua m u a a for all m 1 corollary 3 2 let r be a conformal ambiskew polynomial ring of the form r a u u 1 where u z a and the k algebra a is a domain such that a y 1 is simple and z a y 1 k let k the ideal z r is maximal if and only if u a m u a a for all m 1 proof recall that r z r w a u from remark 2 3 we know that as a y 1 is simple and z a y 1 k a is simple and m is outer for all m 1 if u 0 then w a u is not simple by theorem 3 1 and u a m u a 0 6 a so we can assume that u 6 0 in the domain a thus conditions i ii and iii in theorem 3 1 hold for w a u and z r is maximal if and only if u a m u a a for all m 1 example 3 3 let r be as in example 2 6 thus char k 0 a k t t t 2 1 u 1 4 t 1 2 v t and r is the enveloping algebra u sl 2 then every height one prime ideal of r has the form z r for some k and r z r w k t u for m 1 let mm u a m

maximal on the other hand if 1 4 m 2 for some necessarily unique m n thenmm v m a t m 1 a is maximal and by corollary 3 2 z is not maximal example 3 4 let r be the quantum enveloping algebra uq sl 2 as in example 2 7 thus q k is not a root of unity a k t 1 t q 2 t 1 and u q 1 t qt 1 q q 1 2 every height one prime ideal of r has the form z r xy u r for some k and r z r w k t 1 u where t q 2 t we have seen in 3 4 that for m 1 v m q 2 m 1 q 1 q q 1 2 t q 2 2 mt 1 for m 1 let mm u a m u a u a v m a then t 1 q 2 m 2 t mod v m a from which it follows that mm contains the ideal t 2 q 2 2 m a and the maximal ideal t a where q q 1 2 q 1 q 2 m 1 it now follows that mm 6 a mm is maximal 2 q 2 2 m q 1 m q m qm q q 1 2 9 by corollary 3 2 the ideal z r is maximal if and only if 6 q m qm q q 1 2 for all m n the following lemma determines those values of for which r z r is simple in example 2 8 lemma 3 5 suppose that q is not a root of unity let a u q p 1 2 z 1 p qzp and be as in example 2 8 and let k let m n then the ideal u a m u a is proper if and only if q p 2 m 1 4 qm 1 if q p 2 m 1 4 qm 1 then u a m u a is a maximal and completely prime ideal of a and u a a u a a for all a n m proof suppose that u a a u a is proper let b be the subalgebra of a generated by z 11 z 1 2 z 1 p 1 as for s in example 2 8 it follows from 13 proposition 1 3 that b is simple and z b k it then follows from 14 lemma 9 6 9 i that the maximal ideals of a have the form zp a k and are completely prime with factors isomorphic to quantum tori in p 1 indeterminates so there exists k such that u zp a and m u zp

zp q p 2 m 3 4 q 1 m 1 q p 6 m 3 4 z 1 p thus u a m u a zp q p 2 m 3 4 a 6 a moreover as q q p 2 m 1 4 z 1 p and 1 q p 6 m 3 4 z 1 p generate distinct maximal ideals u a m u a zp q p 2 m 3 4 a which is a maximal and completely prime ideal of a finally if u a a u a 6 a then q p 2 a 1 4 qa 1 q p 2 m 1 4 qm 1 10 from which it follows successively that q a 2 qa 1 q m 2 qm 1 q a 2 q a 2 q m 2 q m 2 qa q a qm q m and qa qm qa qm q a m as q is not a root of unity this cannot happen if a n m corollary 3 6 if r is as in example 2 8 then z r is maximal if and only if for all m 1 6 q p 2 m 1 4 qm 1 proof this is immediate from corollary 3 2 and lemma 3 5 we now aim to establish conditions that in the context of corollary 3 2 will imply that when z r is not maximal there is a unique non zero prime ideal in r z r lemma 3 7 let w w a u be a generalized weyl algebra with u central in a let j 1 be such that ua j u a a let j be an ideal of w if y j j then y j 1 j and if xj j then xj 1 j consequently

ei x iy i see definitions 1 2 lemma 3 10 let w and m be as in proposition 3 8 for 0 i m dia ua a dia m u a and eia i u a a eia m i u a proof suppose that dia ua 6 a and let m be a maximal ideal of a containing dia ua as u is central there exists j such that 1 j i m j u m and u m this contradicts the conditions of proposition 3 8 so dia ua a similarly dia m u a a and applying i eia i u a a eia m i u a lemma 3 11 let w i and j j i be as in proposition 3 8 and suppose that i is a maximal ideal of a then j is a maximal ideal of w proof recall that xm j and y m j let m be an ideal of w such that j m there exist a m 1 a 0 am 1 a such that g a m 1 x m 1 a 0 am 1 y m 1 m and ai ii for at least one i with m 1 i m 1 suppose that ai ii for some i with 0 i m 1 then there exists such that 0 i m 1 and ai i but y gy m 1 i m and its coefficient of y m 1 is ai replacing g by y gy m 1 i and recalling that y m j m we can assume that i m 1 thus am 1 im 1 i let f denote the set of all elements f a for which there exist b m 1 bm 2 a such that b m 1 x m 1 b 0 bm 2 y m 2 fy m 1 m then f is an ideal of a am 1 f i and i f so f 6 i and by the maximality of i f a hence we may assume that am 1 1 and that g w 1 m w 0 wm 2 y m 1 m where for m 1 i m 2 wi is homogeneous of degree i consider xm 1 gy m 1 xm 1 w 1 my m 1 xm 1 w 0 y m 1 xm 1 y m 1 y m 1 m the term xm 1 y m 1 xm 1 is homogeneous of degree 1 m and the other terms have de gree m as w k ax k for k m and xm j m the other terms are in m hence xm 1 y ixm 1 m that is em 1 x m 1 m where as in notation 3 9 em 1 u 1 u m 2 u as i 1 m m 1 u a m 1 u xm 1 m hence m 1 u a em 1 a x m 1 m and it follows from lemma 3 10 that xm 1 m by lemma 3 7 m w the argument if ai ii for some i with 0 i 1 m is similar we may assume that i 1 m and a 1 m 1 and consider y m 1 gy m 1 which belongs to m giving that y m 1 xm 1 y m 1 dm 1 y m 1 m which leads us to conclude using lemma 3 10 and the fact that uxm 1 j m that m w this completes the proof that j is maximal lemma 3 12 let w be as in proposition 3 8 let i ua m u a and let j j i be as in proposition 3 8 any prime ideal p of w containing xm and y m must contain j 12 proof for i 0 let di y ix i u 2 u i u let k be an ideal of w that contains xm and y m we claim that dm 1 j k for this it suffices to show that dm 1 ji k for all i z as y m k and xm k ji k and j i k for i m let 1 i m then j i x ia so dm 1 j i dm 1 x ia y m 1 xm 1 x ia y m 1 xmx i 1 a k also for 0 i m ji iy i so dm 1 ji dm 1 iy i udm 1 y ia m u dm 1 y ia udm 1 y ia dmy ia here dm y mxm k and udm 1 xy y m 1 xm 1 xy mxm 1 k so dm 1 ji k this completes the proof of the claim that dm 1 j k now suppose that k is prime and that j 6 k then as j is an ideal and dm 1 j k dm 1 k note that x m 1 u xm 1 xy xmy k so xm 1 ua dm 1 a k it follows by lemma 3 10 that xm 1 k by lemma 3 7 k w this is a contradiction so j k theorem 3 13 let w a u be a generalized weyl algebra with u central and regular in a such that for some fixed m n i au a i u a for all i n m ii m au a m u is a maximal ideal in a then the ideal j m is a maximal ideal of w containing both xm and y m and is the unique prime ideal p in w for which there exists r n such that xr p and y r p moreover if a is simple and no power of is inner then j m is the unique non zero prime ideal in w proof by lemmas 3 11 and 3 12 respectively j m is maximal and is the unique prime ideal in w containing xm and y m letk be an ideal ofw containing xr and y r for some r n by lemma 3 7 if 0 r m then k w and if r m then xm k and y m k hence j m is the unique prime ideal p in w for which there exists r n such that xr p and y r p now suppose that a is simple and that no power of is inner let p be a non zero prime ideal of w recall from definitions 1 2 that a y 1 and a x 1 1 are the localizations of w at the ore sets y i i 1 and x i i 1 respectively these rings are simple by 14 theorem 1 8 5 so by 12 lemma 3 1 there exist r s such that xr p and y s p replacing r and s by their maximum we can assume that r s by the above p j m corollary 3 14 let r be a conformal ambiskew polynomial ring of the form r a u u 1 where u z a k and the k algebra a is a domain such that a y 1 is simple and z a y 1 k let k be such that u a m u a 6 a for some m 1 if the ideal u a m u a is maximal and u a n u a a for all n n m then r z r has a unique non zero prime ideal proof this is immediate from theorem 3 13 using the isomorphism between r z r and w a u in the case of u sl 2 and uq sl 2 the maximal ideals that arise in the form j m are the annihilators of the finite dimensional simple modules these are well understood and provide nice illustrations of the theory developed above 13 example 3 15 let r be the enveloping algebra u sl 2 as in example 2 6 and example 3 3 thus char k 0 a k t t t 2 1 u 1 4 t 1 2 and v t we have seen that each v m m t m 1 whence v m a is maximal in a and that if z r is not maximal in r then 1 4 m 2 for some m n in this case u a m u a v m a and u a n u a a for all n n m by corollary 3 14 r z r has a unique non zero prime ideal example 3 16 let r be the quantum enveloping algebra uq sl 2 as in example 2 7 and example 3 4 thus q k is not a root of unity a k t 1 t q 2 t 1 and u q 1 t qt 1 q q 1 2 every height one prime ideal of r has the form z r and r z r can be identified with w k t 1 u let k m n and mm u a m u a we have seen in example 3 4 that mm 6 a if and only if is maximal if and only if q m qm q q 1 2 let q m qm q q 1 2 for n n m q n qn q m qm qm qn 1 q m n 0 so as q is not a root of unity mn a it now follows from corollary 3 14 that r z r has a unique non zero prime ideal j mm in the next example the exceptional maximal ideals j m have infinite codimension over k and so are not annihilators of finite dimensional simple modules example 3 17 let p 1 be odd let q k and suppose that q is not a root of unity let r r a v 1 and its casimir element z be as in example 2 8 we have seen that the height one prime ideals of r are the ideals z r and in corollary 3 6 that z r is maximal unless q p 2 m 1 4 qm 1 for some m n to complete the analysis of the spectrum of r let m n and let q p 2 m 1 4 qm 1 it follows from theorem 3 13 together with lemma 3 5 and its proof that in this case r z r which we identify with w a u has a unique non zero prime ideal j zp q p 2 m 3 4 a therefore the prime spectrum of r consists of 0 the height one prime ideals z r k and countably many height two prime ideals fm 1 1 j zp q p 2 m 3 4 a and fm 1 1 j zp q p 2 m 3 4 a where m n and each r r z r is the appropriate canonical epimorphism 4 goldie rank in examples 3 3 3 4 and 3 17 the height one prime ideals are principal generated by translates of the casimir element all but countably many of these are maximal and the other maximal ideals have height two for u sl 2 in 3 3 and uq sl 2 in 3 4 the height two maximals are annihilators of finite dimensional simple modules and so the factor rings are matrix rings over k for u sl 2 there is one simple module of each dimension d n and 14 so there is a unique height two maximal ideal of goldie rank d for uq sl 2 there are two height two maximal ideals of goldie rank d in example 3 17 the simple factor rings r fm 1 and r fm 1 are infinite dimensional and hence not isomorphic to matrix rings over k it is the purpose of this section to show that in the situation of theorem 3 13 but with the further condition that a m is a right ore domain the factor w j m has goldie rank m notation 4 1 for the remainder of the paper let w w a u be a generalized weyl algebra with u central and regular in a such that for some fixedm n m au a m u is such that a m is a simple right ore domain and au a i u a for i n m notation 4 2 in the notation of 4 1 and for 0 i m 1 let mi i m a i u a m i u i u a m i u a thus each mi is a maximal ideal as the generators s u are central mimj mjmi for 0 i j m 1 also m 0 m 1 mm 1 are distinct for if 0 i j m and i m mi mj j m then j i u j i m m which is impossible as au a j i u a so the following result applies lemma 4 3 let r be a ring with m commuting distinct maximal ideals m 0 m 1 mm 1 let 0 i 1 ir j 1 js k 1 kt m be distinct integers i mi 1 mir mj 1 mjs r ii mk

1 b s such that mia m and mjb m but then by maximality mia m mjb contrary to the hypotheses ii this is immediate from i and the law i j k ij ik iii we proceed by induction on i the statement is certainly true when i 0 so we may assume that i 0 and that m 0 mi 1 m 0 mi 1 let j m 0 mi 1 m 0 mi 1 then j mi r by i so as the mj s commute j mi j mi j mi jmi mij jmi j mi whence m 0 m 1 mi m 0 m 1 mi our aim now is to find m uniform right ideals of the z graded ring w j m whose sum is direct and equal to w j m notation 4 4 in the notation of 4 1 and 4 2 and for 0 i j m 1 and i r j we shall denote the product mimi 1 mr 1 mr 1 mj by m i r j and the product mimi 1 mj by m i j the components w j m d and w j m d are 0 if d m if 0 d m then by lemma 4 3 iii w j m d ay d m 0 m 1 d y d and w j m d ax d m d m 1 xd each w j m d is an a a bimodule while in accordance with the proof of proposition 3 8 right and left multiplication by y respectively x give well defined maps w j m d w j m d 1 respectively w j m d w j m d 1 notation 4 5 in the notation of 4 1 4 2 and 4 4 and for 0 r m 1 let j r be the graded right ideal m 0 r m 1 w j m j m 15 of w j m the 0 component of j r is m 0 r m 1 m 0 m 1 if d m r 1 then j r d 0 and if 1 d m r 1 then j r d m 0 r m 1 d y d m 0 m 1 d y d if r d then j r d 0 and if 1 d r then j r d m d r m 1 xd m d m 1 xd lemma 4 6 in the notation of 4 5 the sum j 0 j 1 j m 1 is direct and equal to w j m proof it suffices to show that for m d m j 0 d j 1 d j m 1 d w j m d and that the sum is direct let 0 s m then by repeated use of lemma 4 3 ii j 0 0 j 1 0 j s 0 sj 0 m 0 j m 1 m 0 m 1 m s 1 m 1 m 0 m 1 similar calculations show that if 0 d m then j 0 d j s d sj 0 m 0 j m d 1 y d m 0 m 1 y d m s 1 m d 1 y d m 0 m d 1 y d and j 0 d j s d sj d m d j m 1 x d m d m 1 xd m s 1 m 1 xd m d m 1 xd taking s m 1 above j 0 0 j 1 0 j m 1 0 a m 0 m 1 w j m 0 and for 0 d m j 0 d j 1 d j m 1 d ay d m 0 m d 1 y d w j m d and j 0 d j 1 d j m 1 d ax d m d m 1 xd w j m d it follows that j 0 j 1 j m 1 w j m also if s m 1 then j s 1 0 m 0 s 1 m 1 m 0 m 1 and if 0 d m then j s 1 d m 0 s 1 m d 1 y d m 0 m 1 y d 16 and j s 1 d m d s 1 m 1 xd m d m 1 xd thus using lemma 4 3 iii j 0 d j 1 d j s d j s 1 d 0 for all d and so j 0 j 1 j s j s 1 0 whence the sum j 0 j 1 j m 1 is direct lemma 4 7 for 0 r m 1 the right ideal j r of w is uniform proof first consider the a module j r 0 using lemma 4 3 j r 0 m 0 r m 1 m 0 m 1 m 0 r m 1 mr m 0 r m 1 mr m 0 r m 1 mr a mr as a m and a mr are isomorphic rings a mr is a right ore domain and hence j r 0 is a uniform right a module we next show that if 0 6 j j r then there exists w w such that jw has non zero component in degree 0 let d 0 be such that j r d 6 0 thus d m r 1 let h ay d m 0 m d 1 y d j r d where a m 0 r m d 1 and suppose that in j r d 1 hx 0 as ay dx ay d 1 u a d u y d 1 0 hx a d u y d 1 m 0 m d y d 1 0 hence a d u mr so either a mr or d u mr but 0 d r m and i u m for 0 i m so d u mr r m therefore a mr so a mr m 0 r m d 1 m 0 m d 1 by lemma 4 3 iii and h 0 it follows that if 0 6 h j r d then 0 6 hx d j r 0 a similar argument shows that if 0 6 h j r d then 0 6 hy d j r 0 therefore if 0 6 j j r then there exists w w such that jw has non zero component in degree 0 now let t r m 1 u r 1 u r 1 u r m 1 u we shall see that with j and w as above 0 6 jwt j r 0 let d 0 and as above let h ay d m 0 m d 1 y d j r d where a m 0 r m d 1 then h r d u a r u y d m 0 m d 1 y d 0 as r u mr whence a r u mr m 0 r m d 1 m 0 m d 1 17 thus j r d r d u 0 similarly j r d d r u 0 it follows that j r t j r 0 let h a m 0 m 1 j r 0 where a m 0 r m 1 suppose that ht 0 then at mr so mr contains one of a r m 1 u r 1 u r 1 u r m 1 u but the only integers such that u mr are r and m r so a mr and h 0 combining the previous three paragraphs if 0 6 j j r then there exists w w such that jw has non zero component in degree 0 jwt is homogeneous of degree 0 and jwt 6 0 finally let j 1 j 2 j r 0 by the above there exist v 1 v 2 w such that j 1 v 1 and j 2 v 2 are non zero and homogeneous of degree 0 as j r 0 is a uniform right a module it follows that j 1 w j 2 w 6 0 and hence that j r is a uniform right w module proposition 4 8 let w w a u be a generalized weyl algebra with u central and regular in a such that for some fixed m n m au a m u is such that a m is a simple right ore domain and au a i u a for i n m then the ring w j m has right goldie rank m proof this is immediate from lemmas 4 6 and 4 7 the next result amends corollary 3 14 to include the information on goldie rank given by proposition 4 8 corollary 4 9 let r be a conformal ambiskew polynomial ring of the form r a u u 1 where u z a k and the k algebra a is a domain such that a y 1 is simple and z a y 1 k let k be such that the ideal z r is not maximal and u a m u a 6 a for some m 1 if the factor a u a m u a is a simple right ore domain and u a n u a a for all n n m then r z r has a unique non zero prime ideal p z r and r p has right goldie rank m proof this is immediate from theorem 3 13 using the isomorphism between r z r and w a u corollary 4 10 suppose that q is not a root of unity let r r a v 1 be as in examples 2 8 and 3 17 let m n the prime ideals fm 1 and fm 1 of r specified in example 3 17 have right goldie rank m proof the conditions of corollary 4 9 are satisfied by lemma 3 5 and the fact that a is right noetherian references 1
