key words golod shaferevich algebras free subalgebras noetherian alge bras polynomial identity algebras finitely presented algebras jacobson rad ical nil rings introduction in 1964 golod and shaferevich proved the golod shafarevich theorem and subsequently golod constructed finitely generated nil and not nilpotent al gebras 9 8 recall that an algebra is nil if every element to some power is zero and that finitely generated nil algebras have no infinite dimensional homomorphic images which are noetherian nor which satisfy a polynomial identity 13 therefore in general we cannot hope that golod shafarevich 1 http arxiv org abs 1207 6503 v 3 gs algebras free subalgebras noetherian images 2 algebras with an infinite number of defining relations can be mapped onto in finite dimensional noetherian algebras nor onto infinite dimensional algebras satisfying a polynomial identity in this paper we will show that the case where the number of defining relations is finite is different namely that the following result holds theorem 0 1 let k be an algebraically closed field and let a be the free noncommutative algebra generated in degree one by elements x y let be a natural number let i denote the ideal generated in a by homogeneous elements f 1 f 2 f a suppose that there are exactly ri elements among f 1 f 2 f with degrees larger than 2 i and not exceeding 2 i 1 assume that there are no elements among f 1 f 2 f with degree k if 2 n 2 n 1 2 n 2 k 2 n 1 2 n for some n denote y n rn 6 0 suppose that for all n y m 0 y with m n we have 23 n 4 i n i y r 32 i rn 2 2 n m 3 then a i contains a free noncommutative graded subalgebra in two genera tors and these generators are monomials of the same degree in particular a i is not jacobson radical moreover a i can be homomorphically mapped onto a graded prime noetherian algebra with linear growth which satisfies a polynomial identity for a more general result see theorem 7 1 the following related question remains open is there a finitely presented infinite dimensional nil algebra note that under the conditions of theorem 0 1 the answer to this question is negative it was shown by zelmanov that this question is strongly related to the burnside problem for finitely presented groups namely are all finitely presented torsion groups finite it is also not known if the jacobson radical of a finitely presented algebra is nil zelmanov also asked whether an algebra in d generators subject to d 2 4 relations can be mapped onto infinite dimensional polynomial identity algebras with an affirmative answer possibly having applications within group theory 22 this question is related to theorem gs algebras free subalgebras noetherian images 3 0 1 since by the small warfield result 17 affine algebras with linear growth are finite dimensional modules over their centers with these centers being noetherian and containing subalgebras isomorphic to the polynomial ring k x we recall the definition of the aforementioned golod shafarevich theo rem see 9 22 19 golod shafarevich proved that if the series 1 dt i 2 rit i 1 has all coefficients nonnegative then all free algebras in d gener ators subject to arbitrary homogeneous relations f 1 f 2 with ri relations of degree i are infinite dimensional in 2 anick asked if the converse of the golod shafarevich theorem is true i e if there is a finitely generated algebra in d generators subject to ri homogeneous relations of degree i for i 2 3 provided that the series 1 dt i 2 rit i 1 has a negative coefficient this question is still generally open however the case of relations of degree two is well understood 20 and the complete solution in the case of quadratic semigroup relations was found in 10 another open question again related to theorem 0 1 is whether finitely presented algebras with exponential growth always contain free noncommutative subalgebras theo rem 0 1 shows that under its assumptions the answer is in the affirmative anick proved that finitely presented monomial algebras with exponential growth always contain free noncommutative subalgebras and recently bell and rogalski proved that quotients of affine domains with gelfand kirillov dimension two over uncountable algebraically closed fields contain free non commutative subalgebras in two generators 11 an open question by anick asks whether all division algebras of exponential growth contain free non commutative subalgebras in two generators 1 related questions concerning golod shafarevich groups have also been studied 7 22 in particular zel manov proved that a pro p group satisfying the golod shafarevich condition contains a free non abelian pro p group 21 gs algebras free subalgebras noetherian images 4 0 1 notation in what follows k is a countable algebraically closed field and a is the free k algebra in two non commuting indeterminates x and y by a graded algebra we mean an algebra graded by the additive semigroup of natural numbers the set of monomials in x y is denoted by m and for each k 0 its subset of monomials of degree k is denoted by m k thus m 0 1 and for k 1 the elements in m k are of the form x 1 xk with all xi x y the span of m k in a is denoted by a k its elements are called homogenous polynomials of degree k more generally for any subset x of a we denote by x k its subset of homogeneous elements of degree k the degree deg f of an element f a is the least k 0 such that f a 0 a k any f a can be uniquely written in the form f f 0 f 1 fk with each fi a i the elements fi are the homogeneous components of f a right left two sided ideal of a is homogeneous if it is spanned by its elements homogeneous components if v is a linear space over k we denote by dimv the dimension of v over k a graded k algebra r has a linear growth if there is a number c such that dimr n c for all n we say that a graded infinite dimensional algebra r has quadratic growth if there is a number c such that dimr n cn for all n and r does not have linear growth for more information about the growth of algebras see 12 1 general construction let k be a field and a be a free k algebra generated in degree one by two elements x y suppose that subspaces u 2 m v 2 m of a 2 m satisfy for every m 1 the following properties 1 v 2 m is spanned by monomials 2 v 2 m u 2 m a 2 m and v 2 m u 2 m 0 3 a 2 m 1 u 2 m 1 u 2 m 1 a 2 m 1 u 2 m gs algebras free subalgebras noetherian images 5 4 v 2 m v 2 m 1 v 2 m 1 where for m 0 we set v 20 kx ky u 20 0 we define a graded subspace e of a by constructing its homogeneous com ponents e k as follows given k n let n n be such that 2 n 1 k 2 n then r e k precisely if for all j 0 2 n 1 k we have a j ra 2 n 1 j k u 2 n a 2 n a 2 n u 2 n more compactly e k r a k ara a 2 n 1 u 2 n a 2 n a 2 n u 2 n 1 set then e k n e k lemma 1 1 the set e is an ideal in a moreover if all sets v 2 n are nonzero then algebra a e is infinite dimensional over k proof the proof of the first claim is the same as in theorem 5 in 14 a n is denoted as h n in 14 notice that we only need property 3 to prove that e is an ideal regarding the second claim suppose on the contrary that a e is a finite dimensional algebra by the definition of e we see that a e is a graded algebra hence v 2 n e for some n let r v 2 n e then by the defini tion of e we get that ra 2 n 2 2 n u 2 n 2 since v 2 n 3 a 2 n 2 2 n it follows that v 2 n 4 u 2 n 2 by property 4 v 2 n 2 v 2 n 4 hence v 2 n 2 u 2 n 2 by property 2 u 2 n 2 v 2 n 1 0 a contradiction hence a e is infinite dimensional over k we now prove the following theorem theorem 1 2 let k be a field and a be a free k algebra generated in degree one by two elements x y suppose that subspaces u 2 m v 2 m of a 2 m satisfy properties 1 4 above and moreover that there is n such that dim v 2 n 2 and v 2 m 1 v 2 m v 2 m for all m n then the algebra a e contains a free noncommutative algebra in 2 generators and these generators are monomials of the same degree gs algebras free subalgebras noetherian images 6 proof let v 2 n km 1 km 2 for some monomials m 1 m 2 a 2 n we will show that images of m 1 and m 2 generate a free noncommutative subalge bra in a e recall that e is a graded ideal therefore it is sufficient to show that if f x y k x y is a homogeneous polynomial in two noncom muting variables x y then f m 1 m 2 e notice that f m 1 m 2 a t for some t divisible by 2 n let m be such that 2 m t 2 m 1 and let j 2 m 2 t 2 n observe that f m 1 m 2 v 2 n t 2 n since m 1 m 2 v 2 n and so f m 1 m 2 m 1 j v 2 n 2 m 2 n observe that v 2 n 2 m 2 n v 2 m 2 since by assumption v 2 m 1 v 2 m v 2 m for all m n by property 3 we get u 2 m 2 v 2 m 2 0 therefore f m 1 m 2 m 1 j u 2 m 2 and so f m 1 m 2 e as required by the definition of e this completes the proof theorem 1 3 let k be a field and a be a free k algebra generated in degree one by two elements x y suppose that subspaces u 2 m v 2 m of a 2 m satisfy properties 1 4 above and moreover that there is such that dim v 2 m 1 for all m then v 2 m 1 v 2 m v 2 m and u 2 m 1 u 2 m a 2 m a 2 m u 2 m for all m n proof observe that by property 4 v 2 m 1 v 2 m v 2 m and by assump tion dimv 2 m 1 dimv 2 m v 2 m for all m therefore v 2 m 1 v 2 m v 2 m fixm we will now prove that u 2 m 1 t where t u 2 m a 2 m a 2 m u 2 m notice that t u 2 m 1 by property 3 on the other hand v 2 m 1 v 2 m v 2 m and property 2 imply that t v 2 m 1 a 2 m 1 therefore dimt dima 2 m 1 dimv 2 m 1 by property 2 dimu 2 m 1 dima 2 m 1 dimv 2 m 1 so dimt dimu 2 m 1 since t u 2 m 1 it follows that u 2 m 1 t we will now review some concepts introduced in 14 we will adhere to the notation used in 19 we extend the definition of u 2 n v 2 n to dimensions that are not pow ers of 2 in 14 section 4 the sets 2 5 are named respectively

proof of theorem 5 2 in 15 lemma 1 5 lemma 3 2 15 for any m n and any 0 k 2 m n h k 2 n u 2 n h 2 m n k 1 2 n u 2 m 2 algebras satisfying polynomial identities throughout this section k is a field and a is a free k algebra generated in degree 1 by two elements x y also in this section we assume that subspaces u 2 m v 2 m of a 2 m satisfy properties 1 4 from the beginning of section 1 and that there is such that dimv 2 m 1 for all m gs algebras free subalgebras noetherian images 8 lemma 2 1 there is a natural number c such that for every n the dimen sion of the space tn n i 0 v i v n i is less than c proof by assumption there is a monomial v of degree 2 such that v 2 kv observe that by assumption v 2 i kv 2 i by the definition the spaces v i and v i are contained in the appropriate products of spaces v 2 k it follows that the space tn has a basis consisting of elements of the form qvir where q and r are monomials of degrees not exceeding 2 and i is such that the total degree of qvir is n it follows that dimt n 22 2 2 as required we now recall the definition of the capelli polynomial see pp 8 11 pp 141 6 dn x 1 x 2 xn y 1 y 2 yn s 1 2 n 1 x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x n yn where s 1 2 n is the set of all permutations of the set 1 2 n lemma 2 2 let c be as in lemma 2 1 let n be a natural number and m 1 mc 1 m n and r 1 r 2 rc 1 m be such that deg ri n is divisible by 2 for all i c 1 then dc 1 m

have a 2 t i pa a 2 s 2 u 2 s 1 a 2 s 1 a 2 s 1 u 2 s 1 then because i t were arbitrary and by the definition of e we would get p e fix 0 i 2 we will show now that a 2 t i pa a 2 s 2 u 2 s 1 a 2 s 1 a 2 s 1 u 2 s 1 by lemma 1 3 u i a n i a i u n i v i v n i a n by lemma 2 1 there are i k such that c 1 j 1 jmj u i a n i a i u n i we can assume that mc 1 gs algebras free subalgebras noetherian images 9 i cmi i d for some i k and some d u i a n i a i u n i after substituting the expression for mc 1 into the expression for p we get p k 0 1 2 a 2 k u i a n i a i u n i a 2 q k n note that since degp

we get a 2 i u i u 2 recall that u 2 u 2 hence a 2 k t 1 a 2 i u i a n i a 2 q k n a i a a 2 k t 1 u 2 a b by lemma 1 3 we get u n i a 2 q k n i u 2 q k therefore a 2 k t 1 a 2 i a i u n i a 2 q k n a i a a 2 k t u 2 q k a using a and b we get a 2 t i pa a 2 s 2 k j 0 1 2 a 2 k u 2 j 1 a by assumptions from the beginning of this section we get dimv 2 i 1 if i 0 by theorem 1 3 u 2 i 1 u 2 i a 2 i a 2 i u 2 i for all i 0 applying this property several times we get that for all natural j 0 we have u 2 j i 0 1 j 1 a 2 i u 2 a 2 j i 1 it follows that a 2 t i pa 2 s 2 i j 0 1 a 2 i u 2 a 2 j therefore by lemma 1 4 and because s 1 we get that a 2 t i pa a 2 s 2 a 2 s 1 u 2 s 1 a 2 s 1 u 2 s 1 lemma 2 3 let c be as in lemma 2 1 let 2 c 1 let n be a natural number m 1 m m n and let r 1 r 2 r

lemma 2 2 consider elements e 1 deg r 1 n e 2 deg r 1 deg r 2 2 n e i i k 1 deg rk ni there are c 1 elements i 1 i 2 ic 1 such that e i 1 e i 2 e ic 1 give the same remainder modulo 2 denote z t i d 1 m 1 mi 1 mi 1 m r 1 ri 2 rt 1 mirt ri 1 r observe that for every t n z is a linear combination of such elements namely z i 1 kzi t we will call this construction specializing at place t we can repeat this construction to expressions zi t instead of z after repeating this construction several times and specializing at suitable places we get that z is a linear combination of elements of the form q dc 1 m 1 mc 1 q 1 qc 1 where m 1 mc 1 m 1 m and q a q 1 qc 1 m are such that n qi is divisible by 2 for each i c 1 and q a by lemma 2 2 all such elements are in e and hence z e lemma 2 4 let k be a field and let r be an infinite dimensional graded finitely generated k algebra then r can be homomorphically mapped onto a prime infinite dimensional graded algebra moreover if r has quadratic growth and satisfies a polynomial identity then r can be homomorphically mapped onto a prime graded algebra with linear growth proof we first construct a prime homomorphic image of r let b r be the prime radical of r then r b r is semiprime observe that b r is ho mogeneous since r is graded therefore r b r is graded consequently as a graded ring r b r is either infinite dimensional or nilpotent it cannot be nilpotent because it is semiprime hence p r b r is infinite dimensional graded and semiprime note that since the prime radical of p is zero the intersection of all prime ideals in p which equals the prime radical is zero hence there is a prime ideal q in p which is not equal to p note that the largest homogeneous subset call it m contained in q is also a prime ideal in p now p m is prime and non zero and graded hence it is infinite dimensional as required suppose now that r satisfies a polynomial identity we will now show gs algebras free subalgebras noetherian images 11 that p can be homomorphically mapped onto a prime graded algebra with linear growth since p is prime and satisfies a polynomial identity by rowen s theorem 16 it has a non zero central element z z 1 zm where zi has degree i and zm is nonzero and m 1 notice that zm is cen tral since if r is a homogeneous element of degree d then r z r zm e where e consists of lower degree terms observe that zm is regular as p is prime let s p zmp then dims n dimp n dimp n m since zm is regular homogeneous and of degree m since p is graded with quadratic growth we have some c such that dimp n cn for all n thus we have n i 0 dims i n i 0 dimp n dimp n m m i 0 dimp n i cmn by 17 and since m and c are constant we see that s has at most linear growth if p has linear growth then the proof is finished as p has linear growth and is a homomorphic image of r if p has greater than linear growth then s is infinite dimensional and so by the first part of our theorem s has prime infinite dimensional image with linear growth which is also a homomorphic image of r theorem 2 5 the algebra a e can be homomorphically mapped onto a graded noetherian prime algebra with linear growth proof by lemma 2 4 a e has a prime graded infinite dimensional image which is graded by natural numbers call it p we will now show that p satisfies a polynomial identity the extended centroid of a prime ring is a field see page 70 line 16 3 let c be the extended centroid of p then the central closure cp of p has at most linear growth as an algebra over the field c as there is less than n elements of degree not exceeding n linearly independent over c by lemma 2 3 and theorem 2 3 7 3 by the small stafford warfield theorem every algebra with linear growth satisfies a polynomial identity therefore cp satisfies a polynomial identity 18 it is known that the extended closure cp of a prime ring p is prime see 5 pp 238 and hence by 17 the algebra cp is finite dimensional over its center gs algebras free subalgebras noetherian images 12 by lemma 1 21 in 11 we see that cp satisfies a capelli identity therefore p is a polynomial identity algebra let c be as in lemma 2 1 by proposition 1 1 we have dima k e k k j 0 dimv k j dimv j k 1 c and so a e has at most quadratic growth notice that p has growth smaller than a e by bergman s gap theorem p has either linear or quadratic growth if the latter holds then we are done suppose that a e has quadratic growth then by lemma 2 4 p has a homomorphic image with linear growth by the small warfield theorem 17 prime finitely generated algebras with linear growth are noetherian this completes the proof 3 constructing algebras satisfying given re lations here we give the criteria for when an element f a is in the ideal e theorem 3 1 let n be a natural number suppose that subspaces u 2 m v 2 m of a 2 m satisfying properties 1 4 from section 1 were constructed for all n let f a k where 2 n k 2 n 1 suppose that afa a 2 n 1 a 2 n u 2 n u 2 n a 2 n suppose moreover that for all i j 0 with i j k 2 n we have f a i u 2 n a j u i a k i a k j u j with the sets u i u i defined as in section 1 then f e proof to show that f e it suffices to prove that a i fa j t a 2 n 1 u 2 n 1 u 2 n 1 a 2 n 1 for all i j n with i j k 2 n 2 if i 2 n 1 we get a i 2 n 1 fa j a 2 n u 2 n u 2 n a 2 n u 2 n 1 so a i fa j t similarly if j 2 n 1 we get a i fa j 2 n 1 u 2 n 1 so a i fa j t if i j 2 n then a i 2 n fa j 2 n a 2 n u 2 n u 2 n a 2 n so a i fa j t gs algebras free subalgebras noetherian images 13 if i 2 n and j 2 n 1 then f a 2 n i u 2 n a 2 n 1 j u 2 n i a 2 n 1 2 n j a 2 n 1 i u 2 n 1 j by the assumption so a i fa j a 2 n u 2 n a 2 n 1 t t because a i u 2 n i u 2 n and u 2 n 1 j a j u 2 n 1 by lemma 1 3 the case i 2 n 1 j 2 n is handled similarly we may now conclude that f 0 holds in a e 4 constructing u 2 n v 2 n from f 2 n in this section we introduce sets f 2 n which will later be used to show that the algebra a e satisfies given relations roughly speaking the relations which we want to hold in a e will be contained in the sets f 2 n for more details about the properties and construction of the sets f 2 n see section 6 we begin with a modification of theorem 3 from 14 let rn

assume that zero is a natural number let supy denote the largest element in y if y is finite theorem 4 1 let y s and e n n y be as above let an integer n be given suppose that for every m n we are

all m z and all 0 j e m 3 v 2 m is spanned by monomials 4 f 2 m u 2 m for every m y and f 2 m 0 for every m y gs algebras free subalgebras noetherian images 14 5 v 2 m u 2 m a 2 m 6 a 2 m 1 u 2 m 1 u 2 m 1 a 2 m 1 u 2 m 7 v 2 m v 2 m 1 v 2 m 1 8 moreover if y is finite and m supy then v 2 m 1 then there exist subspaces u 2 n v 2 n of a 2 n such that the extended col lection u 2 m v 2 m m n still satisfies conditions 1 8 proof for properties 1 7 the proof is the same as in 14 when we use e n instead of log n the detailed proof with the same notation can be found in 19 we can use this proof to define inductively v 2 i u 2 i for all i supy denote t supy by definition of s and y and by property 1 from theorem 4 1 we get that v 2 t km 1 km 2 for some m 1 and m 2 in a 2 t then define v 2 t 1 km

satisfy the following conditions for all n y 1 e n n 1 sets sn n 1 e n n 1 are disjoint and rn 2 t n where t n 2 e n 1 3 n 4 k y k n 2 e k 2 we will construct sets f 2 n a 2 n which let us apply theorem 4 1 we begin with the following lemma which generalizes lemma 3 1 from 19 gs algebras free subalgebras noetherian images 18 lemma 6 1 let n be a natural number suppose that for all m n we constructed sets v 2 m u 2 m which satisfy properties 1 8 of theorem 4 1 with e i i y defined as above consider all f a k f 1 f with 2 n 2 n 1 k 2 n 2 n 1 2 n 2 then there exists a linear k space f 2 n a 2 n with the following properties 0 dimf 2 n 1 2 dimv 2 n 1 2 for all i j 0 with i j k 2 n and for every f a k f 1 f we have f a i f 2 n a j u i a k i a k j u j with the sets u i u i defined in section 1 proof by lemma 1 3 we have u i v i a i and u j v j a j therefore a i a 2 n a j u i v i a 2 n u j v j consequently a i 2 n j t t where t u i a k i a k j u j t v i a 2 n v j hence dima i 2 n j dimt dim t dim t t observe that t t 0 since dima i 2 n j dimt dimt because t u i a 2 n u j v i a 2 n u j u i a 2 n v j so dimt dima i 2 n j dim v i a 2 n v j dima i 2 n j dim t it follows that a i 2 n

to belong to a basis and let t i j f a 2 n be the subspace spanned by all the zc d f above we then have dim t i j f dimv i dimv j observe also f a i t i j f a j u i a k i a k j u j define f 2 n 2 n 2

assumption rn 2 t n with t n 2 e i 1 3 n 4 4 k y k n 2 e k from the beginning of this section in this section we will use the following lemma from 19 lemma 6 2 lemma 3 3 19 let k be an algebraically closed field n be a natural number and let t a 2 n and q a 2 n 1 be k linear spaces such that dimt 4 dimq dima 2 n 2 then there exists a k linear space f a 2 n of dimension at most dima 2 n 2 such that t f and q fa 2 n a 2 n f proof a sketch of a proof is included following 19 choose a k linear complement c a 2 n to t we have c t a 2 n 7 let c 1 cs be a basis of c with s dima 2 n dimt let x y

nullstellensatz we show that there are assignments t k and t k for all t 1 s such that the following hold a there are u v such that cu uy uz and cv vy vz give two elements that are linearly independent over k gs algebras free subalgebras noetherian images 20 b q a 2 n ker ker a 2 n we define f ker hence q fa 2 n a 2 n f as required by con struction we have t ker so t f as required because cu uy uz and cv vy vz are k linearly independent we have dimf dima 2 n 2 as required the following lemma is a generalisation of lemma 3 4 from 19 lemma 6 3 suppose that sets u 2 m v 2 m were already constructed for all m n and satisfy the conditions of theorem 4 1 let f f 1 f 2 f be as in theorem 0 1 define a k linear subspace q a 2 n 1 as follows q f f 2 n 2 n 1 deg f 2 n 2 n 1 2 n 2 i j 2 n 1 deg f v i fv j then dimq 1 4 1 2 dimv 2 n 1 2 2 proof by lemma 5 3 the inner sum has dimension at most 22 n k n k y 22 e k 1 2 v 2 n 1 2 22 e n 1 summing over all i j 2 n 1 deg f multiplies by a factor of at most 2 n because 2 n 1 deg f 2 n 1 summing over all f f 1 f with degrees between 2 n 2 n 1 and 2 n 2 n 1 2 n 2 multiplies by rn therefore dimq rn 2 3 n k n k y 22 e k 1 2 v 2 n 1 2 22 e n

dimv 2 n 1 2 2 and f 2 n f 2 n u 2 n 1 a 2 n 1 a 2 n 1 u 2 n 1 moreover for all f f 1 f with deg f 2 n 2 n 1 2 n 2 n 1 2 n 2 we have afa a 2 n 1 a 2 n f 2 n f 2 n a 2 n a 2 n 1 u 2 n 1 a 2 n a 2 n u 2

with f 2 n as in lemma 6 1 observe that 4 dimq 1 2 dimv 2 n 1 2 2 by lemma 6 3 hence dimt dimf 2 n dima 2 n dim v 2 n 1 2 dima 2 n 1 2 dimv 2 n 1 2 therefore dimt 4 dimq dima 2 n 2 and we may apply lemma 6 2 to obtain a set f let i j k n with i j k 2 n 1 and consider f f 1 f with deg f k by lemma 1 3 a i fa j u i v i f u j v j v i fv j u i a 2 n 1 i a 2 n 1 j u j hence a i fa j a 2 n 1 q u i a 2

yields q a 2 n f fa 2 n consequently a i fa j a 2 n 1 a 2 n f fa 2 n u 2 n 1 a 2 n 2 n 1 a 2 n 2 n 1 u 2 n 1 recall u 2 n 1 a 2 n 1 a 2 n 1 u 2 n 1 t f let f 2 n f be a linear k space satisfying f 2 n

dimf dimu 2 n 1 a 2 n 1 a 2 n 1 u 2 n 1 so dimf 2 n dima 2 n 2 dima 2 n dim v 2 n 1 2 dimv 2 n 1 2 2 so the first claim of our theorem holds since f 2 n f f 2 n u 2 n 1 a 2 n 1 a 2 n 1 u 2 n 1 the proof is finished 7 free subalgebras and noetherian images theorem 7 1 suppose that the assumptions of theorem 0 1 hold and that we use the same notation as in theorem 0 1 assume that for each n y there is a natural number 1 e n n 1 such that for all n y sets sn n 1 e n n 1 are disjoint and rn 2 3 n 4 k n k y 22 e k 2 22 e n 1 then a i contains a free noncommutative graded subalgebra in two genera tors and these generators are monomials of the same degree in particular a i is not jacobson radical moreover a i can be homomorphically mapped onto a prime infinite dimensional noetherian graded algebra with linear growth proof we will first show that a i contains a free noncommutative subalge bra we will construct sets u 2 n v 2 n f 2 n satisfying properties 1 7 and 8 from theorem 4 2 applied to e n as in the assumptions of our the orem the union in 6 is disjoint by the assumptions we may therefore start the induction with u 20 f 20 0 and v 20 kx ky then assuming that we constructed u 2 m v 2 m for all m n if n y we construct f 2 n using proposition 6 1 and if n y we set f 2 n 0 we then construct u 2 n v 2 n using theorem 4 2 let e be defined as in section 1 by lemma 1 1 the set e is an ideal in a and a e is an in finite dimensional algebra by theorem 1 2 the algebra a e contains a gs algebras free subalgebras noetherian images 23 free noncommutative subalgebra in two generators and these two genera tors are monomials of the same degree we will now show that a e is a homomorphic image of a i we need to show that i e that is that elements f 1 f 2 f e let f a k be one of these elements for some 2 n 2 n 1 k 2 n 2 n 1 2 n 2 by lemma 6 1 and proposition 6 1 we get that f 2 n f 2 n u 2 n 1 a 2 n 1 a 2 n 1 u 2 n 1 u 2 n con sequently again by lemma 6 1 and proposition 6 1 we get that f satisfies the assumptions of lemma 3 1 therefore and by thesis of lemma 3 1 we have f e as required we will now prove that a i can be mapped onto a prime graded and infinite dimensional algebra which satisfies a polynomial identity we will construct sets u 2 n v 2 n f 2 n satisfying properties 1 8 from theorem 4 1 applied for e n as in the assumptions of our theorem we start the in duction with u 20 f 20 0 and v 20 kx ky then assuming that we constructed u 2 m v 2 m for all m n if n y we construct f 2 n us ing proposition 6 1 and if n y we set f 2 n 0 we then construct u 2 n v 2 n using theorem 4 1 applied for e i as in the assumptions let e be de fined as in section 1 by lemma 1 1 the set e is an ideal in a and a e is an infinite dimensional algebra by theorem 2 5 the algebra a e has a graded prime noetherian infinitely dimensional homomorphic image with linear growth call this r we will now show that r is a homomorphic image of a i we need to show that i e that is that elements f 1 f 2 f e these elements are as in theorem 0 1 let f a k be one of these elements for some 2 n 2 n 1 k 2 n 2 n 1 2 n 2 by lemma 6 1 and proposition 6 1 we get that f 2 n f 2 n u 2 n 1 a 2 n 1 a 2 n 1 u 2 n 1 u 2 n consequently and again by lemma 6 1 and proposition 6 1 we get that f satisfies the assumptions of lemma 3 1 therefore and by thesis of lemma 3 1 we have f e as required lemma 7 2 let y be a subset of the set of natural numbers and let ri i y be a sequence of natural numbers which satisfy assumptions of theorem 0 1 then there are natural numbers e i for i y such that 1 e n n 1 gs algebras free subalgebras noetherian images 24 and such that for all n y sets sn n 1 e n n 1 are disjoint and rn 2 3 n 4 k n k y 2 2 e k 2 22 e n 1 proof for each i let e i be such that 22 e i 3 ri 2 2 e i 2 note that such e i satisfy e i 1 because ri 2 by the assumptions ri 2 2 i j 3 for all i y j y 0 observe then that e i 3 i j 3 for all j i j y 0 therefore e i i j hence e i i j 1 this implies e i i 1 and i e i 1 j 1 therefore sets s n n e n 1 n 1 are disjoint for all n y we will now show that rn 2 t n where t n 2 e i 1 3 n 4 k y k n 2 e k 2 since rn 2 2 e n 2 it suffices to show that 2 e n 2 2 e n 1 3 n 4 k y k n 2 e k 2 hence it suffices to prove that 3 n 4 k y k n 2 e k 2 2 e n 2 since rn 2 2 e n 2 it suffices to show that 23 n 4 k y k

the assumptions of theorem 0 1 proof of theorem 0 1 by lemma 7 2 we can find e i satisfying the assumptions of theorem 7 1 and by the thesis of theorem 7 1 we get the desired result the last part of the thesis follows from the small warfield theorem 17 which says that prime affine algebras with linear growth are finite dimensional modules over its center acknowledgements the author is grateful to
