edu math vancliff abstract in 2010 a quantized analog of a graded clifford algebra gca called a graded skew clifford algebra gsca was proposed by cassidy and vancliff and many properties of gcas were found to have counterparts for gscas in particular a gca is a finite module over a certain commutative subalgebra c while a gsca is a finite module over a typically non commutative analogous subalgebra r we consider the case that a regular gsca is a twist of a gca by an automorphism and we prove in this case r is a skew polynomial ring and a twist of c by an automorphism introduction by 2011 in 5 10 it had been proved that almost all quadratic regular algebras of global dimension two or three may be classified using certain non commutative algebras called graded skew clifford algebras gscas the latter algebras were first defined by cassidy and vancliff in 5 and may be viewed as a quantized analog of a graded clifford algebra gca many properties of gcas were found in 5 to have counterparts for gscas in particular a gca is quadratic and regular if and only if its associated quadric system has no base points whereas a gsca is quadratic and regular if and only if its associated non commutative quadric system is normalizing 2010 mathematics subject classification 16 s 38 16 s 37 16 s 36 key words and phrases regular algebra clifford algebra quadric twist some of this research was carried out while the first author worked at the university of texas at arlington the second author was supported in part by nsf grant dms 0900239 http arxiv org abs 1204 0044 v 3 2 gscas that are twists of gcas and has no base points see theorem 1 3 moreover a gca is a finite module over a certain commutative subalgebra c while a gsca is a finite module over a typically non commutative analogous subalgebra r in this article we consider the case that a regular gsca a is a twist by an automorphism of a gca b in this setting we prove in theorem 2 4 that r is a skew polynomial ring and is a twist of c by an automorphism we also demonstrate in example 2 1 that this can fail if a is not a twist of a gca this article consists of two sections in section 1 notation and terminology are defined while section 2 is devoted to proving our main result which is given in theorem 2 4 acknowledgment the authors thank s p smith of the university of washington for the suggestion to study the subalgebra r 1 definitions in this section we introduce the algebras to be discussed in the paper and some known re sults concerning them including the connection between their homological properties and certain associated geometric data throughout the article k denotes an algebraically closed field such that char k 6 2 and m n k denotes the vector space of n n matrices with entries in k if m is a matrix then mij will denote the ij th entry of m for a graded k algebra e the span of the homogeneous elements in e of degree i will be denoted ei and if f is any ring or vector space then f will denote the nonzero elements in f let n 1 nn m n k denote symmetric matrices by definition c f 7 a graded clif ford algebra gca is the k algebra b on degree one generators x 1 xn and on degree two generators y 1 yn with defining relations given by a xixj xjxi n k 1 nk ij yk for all i j 1 n and b yk central for all k 1 n we write c for the subalgebra of b generated by y 1 yn and note that c is a polynomial ring and that b is a finite module over c results on gcas can be found in 11 12 the notion of graded skew clifford algebra is similarly defined but uses a generalization of the notion of symmetric matrix as follows let m n k where ij ji 1 for all i j with i 6 j in 5 a matrix m m n k is defined to be symmetric if mij ijmji for all i j definition 1 1 5 suppose additionally that ii 1 for all i and let m 1 mn m n k be symmetric matrices a graded skew clifford algebra gsca is the k algebra a on degree one generators x 1 xn and on degree two generators y 1 yn with defining relations given by gscas that are twists of gcas 3 a degree two relations xixj ijxjxi n k 1 mk ij yk for all i j 1 n and b degree three and degree four relations that guarantee the existence of a normalizing se quence y 1 y n that spans n k 1 kyk we refer to the subalgebra of a generated by y 1 yn as r and note that a is a finite module over r clearly a gca is a special case of a gsca it is proved in 5 that it is possible for all the yk to belong to a 1 2 and this happens if and only if m 1 mn are linearly independent however even in this case a need not be a quadratic algebra one may associate to a symmetric matrix a quadratic form and hence a quadric in pn 1 similarly as was shown in 5 one may associate a non commutative quadratic form and a non commutative quadric to a symmetric matrix as follows let s denote the k algebra on generators z 1 zn with defining relations zjzi ijzizj for all i j where ii 1 for all i if z z 1 zn t and if m m n k is a symmetric matrix then the map m ztmz from the vector space of symmetric n n matrices to s 2 is an isomorphism of vector spaces 5 as in 5 we call the elements of s 2 quadratic forms if q s 2 then the intersection in p s 1 p s 1 of the zero locus of the defining relations of s with the zero locus of q is called the quadric associated to q if q s 2 is normal in s then its quadric parametrizes those point modules over s that are annihilated by q thus this notion of quadric generalizes the commutative definition definition 1 2 a 5 the span of quadratic forms q 1 qm s 2 will be called the quadric system associated to q 1 qm if a quadric system is given by a normalizing sequence in s then it is called a normalizing quadric system b 6 we define a left base point of a quadric system q s 2 to be any left base point module over s q that is to be any 1 critical graded left module over s q that is generated by its homogeneous degree zero elements and which has hilbert series h t c 1 t for some c n we say a quadric system is left base point free if it has no left base points similarly for right base point etc if s is commutative then the notions of base point and base point free agree with their commutative counterparts since the only base point modules in this case are point modules by 6 corollary 11 a normalizing quadric system q is left base point free if and only if dimk s q hence such a quadric system is left base point free if and only if it is right base point free in particular the adjectives right and left may be dropped when referring to a normalizing quadric system being base point free 4 gscas that are twists of gcas this geometric data associated to a gca or gsca has fundamental influence on homological data of the algebra as demonstrated in the next result the reader is referred to 1 8 for definitions of the terms theorem 1 3 a 4 7 the gca b is quadratic auslander regular of global dimension n and satisfies the cohen macaulay property with hilbert series 1 1 t n if and only if its associated commutative quadric system is base point free in this case b is as regular and is a noetherian domain b 5 6 the gsca a is quadratic auslander regular of global dimension n and satisfies the cohen macaulay property with hilbert series 1 1 t n if and only if its associated quadric system is normalizing and base point free in this case a is as regular is a noetherian domain and is unique up to isomorphism in the next section we will consider a gsca that is a twist in the sense of definition 1 4 of a gca by an automorphism definition 1 4 3 8 let d k 0 dk be a graded k algebra and let be a graded degree zero automorphism of d the twist d of d by is a graded k algebra that is the vector space k 0 dk with a new multiplication defined as follows if a d i di b d j dj then a b a i b where the right hand side is computed using the original multiplication in d and a is the image of a in d etc the twist of a quadratic algebra is again a quadratic algebra for and a as in definition 1 4 we will write a for a we close this section with a simple lemma concerning gcas that will be useful in the next section lemma 1 5 let b be a gca as above if a b b 1 then ab ba is central in b proof the result is a consequence of xixj xjxi being central in b for all i j 2 the main theorem in this section we compare the subalgebras r and c that are defined in section 1 we prove in theorem 2 4 that if the gsca a is a twist by an automorphism of a regular gca b then r is a twist of c by an automorphism and is a skew polynomial ring that is r is a domain on n generators with n n 1 2 defining relations that guarantee that each generator is normal in r not surprisingly the algebra r is not in general a skew polynomial ring nor a twist of a polynomial ring and we first demonstrate this via a simple example gscas that are twists of gcas 5 example 2 1 9 3 2 let n 3 m 3 k be as above and let m 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 m 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 m 3 0 1 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 2 where 13 23 1 and 12 2 by theorem 1 3 b the gsca a associated to this data is quadratic and regular and so is the k algebra on x 1 x 2 x 3 with defining relations x 1 x 2 2 x 2 x 1 x 2 3 x 1 x 3 x 3 x 1 0 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 2 0 where yi x 2 i for i 1 2 3 by lemma 2 2 below since 13 6 12 23 the associated algebra s is not a twist of a polynomial ring and so by 5 proposition 4 5 a is not a twist of a gca by an automorphism moreover y 3 is central in r but no other element in 3 k 1 yk is normal in r this can be seen by using a computer algebra program such as w schelter s affine program and noting that any normal element in r would be normal in r y 3 in order to simplify the computations involved it follows that r is not a skew polynomial ring moreover there is an insufficient number of relations in low degree amongst the yk for r to be a twist of a polynomial ring lemma 2 2 let m n k and s be as in section 1 the algebra s is a twist of the polynomial ring k k z 1 zn by a graded automorphism aut k of degree zero if and only if ik ij jk for all i j k in this case k 1 is semisimple and for all i j we have ij i j where i k and zi izi for all i proof the first part of the result follows from 2 since ik ij jk for all i j k if and only if the point scheme of s or the zero locus of the defining relations of s is isomorphic to pn 1 and the latter holds if and only if s is a twist of the polynomial ring on n variables by an automorphism for the second part of the result suppose s is a twist of the polynomial ring k k z 1 zn by a graded automorphism aut k of degree zero where we identify zi and zi for all i from the relations in s we have zjz i ijziz j in k for all i j however k is a commutative unique factorization domain and deg zi 1 for all i so zi is irreducible in k moreover if i 6 j then zi zj so by zi z i for all i since z i has degree one z i k zi for all i hence k 1 is semisimple writing z i izi where i k for all i and substituting into completes the proof remark 2 3 suppose that b is a regular gca in the sense of theorem 1 3 and that a is a gsca that is a twist of b by a graded automorphism aut b of degree zero as was shown in section 1 there is a skew polynomial ring s associated to a by 5 proposition 4 5 since a is a twist of b by there exists a choice for s so that s is a twist of the polynomial ring 6 gscas that are twists of gcas k k z 1 zn by 1 and conversely by lemma 2 2 k 1 is semisimple and for each i we have zi izi for some i k and ij j i for all i j in the notation of lemma 2 2 i 1 i for all i since 1 theorem 2 4 suppose that a is a regular gsca in the sense of theorem 1 3 b and that r is the subalgebra of a generated by the yk as in definition 1 1 if a is a twist of a gca b by a graded automorphism aut b of degree zero then r is a twist of the analogous subalgebra c of b generated by the yk and is a skew polynomial ring that is r is a domain that has exactly n n 1 2 defining relations that guarantee that each yk is normal in r proof by remark 2 3 we may assume that s is a twist of the polynomial ring k k z 1 zn by 1 and that zi izi for some i k and that ij j i for all i j if necessary by lemma 1 5 we may also re choose the xk b 1 so that x 1 xn is dual to the basis z 1 zn for k 1 and so that the degree two relations of b still have the form given in section 1 although the symmetric matrices n 1 nn might change with this choice of bases it follows that x i ixi for all i and that the twist of xi is xi hence xixj ijxjxi xixj j i xjxi k x i xj x jxi for all i j we will prove that each x i xj x jxi rij is a normal element of a by definition 1 1 and rij r for all i j so the subalgebra of a generated by the rij is contained in r since a is quadratic each yk is a function of the rij and so r is the subalgebra of a generated by the rij moreover for all i j k we have xkrij xk x i xj x jxi xk x 2 i x 2 j x 2 j x 2 i 2 i 2 jxk xixj xjxi 2 i 2 j xixj xjxi xk 2 k 2 i 2 j x i xj x jxi xk ki kjrijxk so that the rij are normal in a it follows that rijrkp ik jk ip jprkprij 2 ik 2 jprkprij since ij j i for all i j thus r is a skew polynomial ring for all i j k p let ijkp 2 ik 2 jp so ijkp kpab ijab for all i j k p a b by lemma 2 2 it follows that r is a twist of a polynomial ring for all i j let cij b denote the element that twists to rij a that is cij x i x j x j x i xixj xjxi k xixj xjxi c gscas that are twists of gcas 7 moreover since b is quadratic each yk is a function of the xixj xjxi and so a function of the cij it follows that c is the subalgebra of b generated by the cij and so r is a twist of c by we have cijc 2 kp ijkpckpc 2 ij for all i j k p defining aut c by cij 2 i 2 jcij for all i j so 2 c we find that r is a twist of c by references 1 m artin and w schelter graded algebras of global dimension 3 adv math 66 1987 171 216
