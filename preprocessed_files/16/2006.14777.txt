algebras our approach is based on known facts about group gradings of matrix algebras 4 and other sources 1 introduction many papers have been devoted to the study of actions of hopf algebras on algebras however very few of them have actually classified the possible actions of a certain hopf algebra on a given algebra one of the first of these papers was the determination of the actions of the taft algebra and its double on a one generator algebra 16 more recently there has been a series of papers such as 10 8 on mostly semisimple hopf algebras acting on certain rings usually domains finally in 11 the actions of a taft algebra on finite dimensional algebras have been studied in order to look at their polynomial identities in this paper we study the actions of finite dimensional pointed hopf algebras with abelian group of group like elements on matrix algebras our methods are novel in that we use very strongly the classification of group gradings on matrices as in 4 we also use heavily the well known fact see 14 and also 15 chapter 6 that any action of a hopf algebra on a central simple algebra is inner one motivation for this work is to try to extend the work of 19 and 7 on the hopf brauer group to hopf algebras which are not quasitriangular to state our results in more detail we need few standard general definitions let h be a finite dimensional hopf algebra over a field f suppose that h acts on a unital algebra a this means that there is a unital left h module structure on a written by h a h a such that h 1 h 1 and h ab h 1 a h 2 b where h h a b a and h h 1 h 2 if is another action of h on a we say that the actions are isomorphic if there is an algebra automorphism a a such that h a h a for any h h and any a a the actions are called equivalent if there is an automorphism of algebras a a and an automorphism of hopf algebras h h such that h a h a for any h h and any a a we say that the action is inner if there is a convolution invertible linear map u h a such that for any h h and a a we have keywords hopf algebras graded algebras algebras given by generators and defining relations 2010 mathematics subject classification primary 16 t 05 secondary 16 w

abs 2006 14777 v 2 2 bahturin and montgomery h a h u h 1 au 1 h 2 in section 2 we recall the classification of gradings by abelian groups on the matrix algebras in the case where the group g of group likes of a hopf algebra h is semisimple the action of g is equivalent to the grading by the dual group g since any finite dimensional pointed hopf algebra h with abelian group g of group likes is generated by the group like and skew primitive elements see the survey 2 to determine the action of h we need to know the action of skew primitive elements on g graded algebras some information about this is given in proposition 3 1 in section 4 we give the criterion of isomorphism of two actions of a finite dimensional pointed hopf algebras on a matrix algebra theorem 4 2 in terms of their respective inner actions in section 5 we recall the definition of a class of pointed hopf algebras by an ruskiewitshch schneider 1 in terms of generators and defining relations then in theorems 5 3 5 5 5 6 we determine the relations satisfied by the matrices of the inner actions of these generators this enables us in what follows to approach the classification of the actions up to isomorphism in section 5 2 we determine the canonical form of these matrices in the case of pointed hopf algebras of rank 1 with the cyclic group of group likes in section 5 3 we study the actions of a pointed hopf algebra h on a matrix algebra a in the case where the respective g grading is a division grading that is a is a g graded division algebra we call such actions division actions theorem 5 9 treats division actions in the case where h is a pointed hopf algebra of rank 1 in proposition 5 10 we classify up to isomorphism the division actions of a pointed hopf algebra of dimension p 3 from 1 in section 5 11 we treat a much harder case of mixed gradings in section 6 we deal with the actions of the taft algebra tn canonically generated by g x on the matrix algebras theorem 6 1 gives the classification of such actions in the case where the matrix u x of the inner action of x is non singular in theorem 6 2 we give a complete classification in the case of the actions of t 3 on m 3 section 7 is devoted to the study of the actions of the drinfeld double d tn of tn on matrix algebras in section 7 1 we give the matrices for the division action d tn the case of mixed action is treated up to isomorphism in the case of d t 2 in section 7 3 we treat the case where the action of d tn is elementary in section 8 we describe the matrix form of the actions of uq sl 2 on the matrix algebras in section 8 1 we handle the inner actions of so called book hopf algebras from 1 and in section 8 2 we classify the actions of uq sl 2 on m 2 f in section 8 3 we note that all actions of uq sl 2 can be lifted up to the elementary actions of d tq but no division grading of d tq is a lifting of an action of uq sl 2 2 group gradings let g g h the group of group like elements in h denote by g the group of multiplicative f characters of g from now on we will be assuming that g is abelian and f is such that g g for instance f algebraically closed of characteristic coprime to g or f r and g 2 etc in this case it is well known that the group gradings and actions of pointed hopf algebras 3 algebra a acquires a g grading 1 a ga given by a a a g a g a for any g g if a a we also write deg a the set supp g a 6 0 is called the support of the grading the subspaces a are called homogeneous components of a an element a a is called homogeneous of degree one writes deg a a subspace b is called graded if b g b a group gradings on mn f have been completely described over arbitrary alge braically closed fields f 6 see also 17 9 chapter 2 and references therein let us call a graded algebra a graded simple if it has no nontrivial proper graded ideals a g graded algebra d is called graded division if all nonzero homogeneous elements of d are invertible in full analogy with the classical wedderburn artin theorem the following is true theorem 2 1 let g be a group and let a be a g graded algebra over a field f if a is graded simple satisfying the descending chain condition on graded left ideals then there exists a g graded algebra d and a g graded right d module v such that d is a g graded division algebra v is finite dimensional over d and a is isomorphic to endd v as a g graded algebra note that if e 1 em is a graded basis of v as a right vector space over d with deg ei i i 1 n then endd v is spanned by the elements eijd where d is a graded element of d and eij ej ei the grading is given by degeijd i deg d 1 j using kronecker products we can write a mn f d and identify eijd with eij d then deg eij d i deg d 1 j if g is abelian then we can simply say that degeijd degeij deg d we often say that v is a right graded vector space over a graded division algebra d if d f the above grading is called elementary defined by the n tuple 1 n if dimd v 1 then the grading is called division in this latter case any nonzero a a is invertible for any g we will use the terms elementary and division also for the actions of a hopf algebra h with g h abelian on a matrix algebra mm f in the case where the respective grading of mm f by g is elementary or division a simple remark is the following remark 2 2 if g h is coprime with m then the action of h on mm f is elementary also if 0 6 p char f and p m then the action of h on mm f is elementary if the grading is elementary and dimf v n then the grading is completely defined by the dimension function n 0 defined as follows let v v then dimv the group g naturally acts on the set of such functions if one defines two elementary gradings defined by the dimension functions and are isomorphic if and only if g let us take a graded basis e 1 en in v with deg ei i then is the number of elements ei 4 bahturin and montgomery in the basis such that deg ei a graded basis of endf v is then formed by the maps eij as above and degeij i 1 j no description of graded division algebras d over arbitrary fields is available but in the case of an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero or coprime to the orders of elements in g they are known to be isomorphic to the twisted group algebras d f t where z 2 t f is a 2 cocycle actually bicharacter on t with values in f two algebras corresponding to the cocycles 1 and 2 are graded isomorphic if and only if 1 and 2 belong to the same cohomology class in z 2 t f in the cohomology class of a bicharacter there is precisely one alternating bicharacter t t f given by an algebra d f t is simple if and only if t t f is nonsingular that is ker 1 for all t is trivial in the classification theorem 2 1 in the case of simple algebras the graded division algebra d is simple as an ungraded algebra as a result d is defined up to isomorphism by its support t and a nonsingular alternating bicharacter t t f different bicharacters lead to nonisomorphic graded division algebras d t note that each homogeneous component d of d t is one dimensional and its basis x can be chosen so that 2 xo i and x 2 x 1 2 1 x 1 x 2 where o is the order of t theorem 2 3 4 also 9 chapter 2 let t be a finite abelian group and let f be an algebraically closed field there exists a grading on the matrix algebra mn f with support t making mn f a graded division algebra over t if and only if charf does not divide n and 3 t z 2 1 z 2 r where 1 r n the isomorphism classes of such gradings are in one to one correspondence with nondegenerate alternating bicharacters t t f all such gradings belong to one equivalence class an explicit matrix realization of d t is the following first of all using the above equation 3 d t d z 2 1 1 d z 2 2 2 d z 2 r r where d z 2 n a mn f and the grading on mn f is given as follows if z 2 n where o o n and is a primitive nth root of 1 then one considers sylvester s clock and shift matrices c 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 n 1 s 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 then the matrices x k c ks satisfy the conditions of equation 2 with nu and the grading of mn f is given by setting a k span x k span x kx span x k x for all 0 k n group gradings and actions of pointed hopf algebras 5 in conclusion as we noted if a is simple then d is also a simple algebra if the field f is algebraically closed d mk f as a result if a is a matrix algebra over an algebraically closed field then for some n k we have a mn f mk f where the grading on mn f is elementary while on mk f the grading is division 3 actions on graded algebras in this paper we are interested in the actions of finite dimensional pointed hopf algebras with abelian group of group likes on matrix algebras we start with the actions of group algebras 3 1 actions of group algebras here we have h fg is the group algebra of an abelian group g let a be a matrix algebra algebra and u h a a convolution invertible map making this action inner in this case the elements u g can be explicitly written as follows let as before g be the group of characters of g g h according to 3 see also 9 corollary 2 43 if we are given a g grading of a mn f endd vd then the matrix u g of the action of for any g g in an appropriate basis of vd can be written as follows let t g be the support of d so that d spanx for each t suppose that 1 s are some elements of g which are pairwise non congruent mod t and such that vd v 1 d v s d is the decomposition of v as a graded vector space over d and all elements of v i are of degree i dimv i di i 1 s then the action of g g can be given as the conjugation by the matrix 4 u g 1 g id 1 xf g s h ids xf g where f g is a uniquely defined element of t such that g x g x xf g x x 1 f g f g x we have f g g since is nonsingular one easily checks that the map f g 7 f g is a well defined homomorphism from g to t the isomorphism classes of these actions are described by the same parameters as the isomorphism classes of corresponding gradings 3 2 skew primitive elements ifh is a pointed non cosemisimple finite dimensional hopf algebra with an abelian group g of group likes then there are always elements h k g a character g f with g 6 1 and an element x 6 fg such that gxg 1 g x for all g g 5 x x h k x 6 for an h k primitive element x one has x 0 and s x k 1 xh 1 if a hopf algebra is generated by g and x as above one can replace x by a g 1 primitive element or 1 g primitive element for a suitable g g thus when we study the actions of hopf algebras which are not group algebras it is important to know the actions of the elements x as above we start with the effect of 5 6 bahturin and montgomery proposition 3 1 let be a grading defined in 1 suppose x is an element of h such that there is a character g f satisfying hx h xh for all h g let k be the kernel of the action of g on a k its orthogonal complement in g t the subgroup generated by supp in g then the following are true i the action of x on a maps any a to a ii if 6 k then x acts trivially on a iii if 6 t then x acts trivially on a iv if there is natural m such that supp m and m 6 then x acts trivially on a proof i indeed if a a and h g then h x a hx a h xh a h x h a h h x a h x a it then follows that x a a ii note that supp k indeed if supp then there is 0 6 a a take any h k then h a ha a it follows that h 1 hence k to prove xa 0 for all a a we write a a is the sum of a a supp by the above supp k if 6 k then there is h k such that h 6 1 we have xa a by i now xagamma h xa h xa but h h h h 6 1 thus xa 0 as claimed iii follows easily from ii considering k is a subgroup of g iv in this case also tm 1 so that iii applies 3 3 taft pairs and algebras now let h contain a group like element g and a 1 g primitive element x such that 7 gn 1 xn 0 gx xg where is a primitive nth root of 1 we have g g g x x 1 g x g 1 x 0 s g g 1 s x g 1 x one calls such a pair of elements a taft pair in this case gsx gs gsx where gs s let g be the cyclic subgroup generated by g an n 2 dimensional hopf algebra generated by an pair g x is called an n 2 dimensional taft algebra denoted by tn or simply tn if is fixed since in this case g zn it follows from the above that a acquires a zn grading as follows let g be given by g set ak a k then a n 1 k 0 ak is the desired grading corollary 3 2 if the action of g is not faithful then the action of x is trivial if the support of the grading is contained in a proper subgroup t of g then the action of x is trivial proof let e 6 gk k n act trivially on a then the support of the grading is contained in proper subgroup t gk of g whereas generates g so we can use proposition 3 1 ii group gradings and actions of pointed hopf algebras 7 4 inner actions on central algebras an algebra a with identity element 1 is called central if its center coincides with f 1 suppose that a hopf algebra h acts on a and this action is inner via the convolution invertible map u h a then for any group like element g g and any h k primitive element x h k g one has 8 g a u g au g 1 x a u x au h 1 u k au k 1 u x u h 1 in the case where x is 1 k primitive we would have 9 g a u g au g 1 x a u x a u k au k 1 u x in the case where x is h 1 primitive we would have 10 g a u g au g 1 x a u x au h 1 au x u h 1 u x a u h 1 here a b ab ba is the usual commutator of a b a lemma 4 1 if g x act as in 9 then setting u x u x u g u g u g does not change the action in the case of 10 the action is preserved if we replace u x by u x i and u g by u g in both cases f and f 0 proof indeed if we denote the old action by and the new one by then g a u g au g 1 u g au g 1 g a x a u x a u g au g 1 u x u x u g a u g au g 1 u x u g u x a u g au g 1 u x x a as claimed the case of 10 is even simpler a much more general isomorphism result about the actions of pointed hopf algebras is the following theorem 4 2 let h be a finite dimensional pointed hopf algebra with abelian group of group likes a a matrix algebra if two inner actions and defined by the functions u h a and v h a are isomorphic then there exists an invertible element c a and g g x f such that u g g cv g c 1 where g f for any grouplike g h and u x cv x c 1 g x u g g x f for any 1 g primitive element x h in the case of a g 1 primitive element y we must have u y cv y c 1 g y i proof if g g h then a a is an isomorphism of actions then g a g a for any a a since a is central simple there is invertible c a such that a cac 1 so we have u g cac 1 u g 1 cv g av g 1 c 1 for all a a as a result v g 1 c 1 u g c 1 is a central element of a since a is central v g 1 c 1 u g c 1 g f and u g g cv g c 1 as claimed we can also write u g c g cv g and v g 1 c 1 g c 1 u g 1 now let x be a 1 g primitive element of h and suppose x a x a then u x cac 1 u g cac 1 g 1 u x c v x a v g av g 1 v x c 1 8 bahturin and montgomery it follows that u x cac 1 cv x ac 1 u g cauc 1 g 1 u x v g av g 1 v x c 1 u x c cv x a cv g a c 1 u g 1 u x c v g 1 v x v g 1 c 1 u x c v g 1 v x a a c 1 u g 1 u x v g 1 v x v g 1 c 1 u x c v g 1 v x a a v g 1 c 1 u x c v g 1 v x as a result v g 1 c 1 u x c v g 1 v x is a central element in a and so there exists g x c such that u x cv x c 1 g u g as claimed conversely suppose our conditions hold and h is generated by its group likes and skew primitives then v g 1 c 1 u g c 1 and v g 1 c 1 u x c v g 1 v x are central elements we can read our calculations in the reverse order to find that a cac 1 preserves the action of group like and skew primitive elements since h is generated by these elements we find that is an isomorphism of actions and 5 pointed hopf algebras pointed hopf algebras with abelian coradical have been classified thanks to ef forts of many authors specially n andruskiewitchsh h j schneider i hecken berger and i angiono a useful survey of the development in the area is 2 in this paper we will be looking at actions of a class oh pointed hopf algebras in the paper 1 let g be a finite nontrivial abelian group a datum for a quantum linear space r r a 1 an 1 n consists of the elements a 1 an g 1 n g g such that the following conditions are satisfied qj j aj 6 1 11 j ai i aj 1 for all 1 i 6 j n 12 one says that the datum or its associated quantum linear space has rank n if nj o qj the order of qi in g then r r a 1 an 1 n is an algebra with the following presentation in terms of generators and defining relations 13 r x 1 xn x ni i 0 xixj j ai xjxi for all 1 i 6 j n let us fix a decomposition g g 1 gk and denote by m the order of g 1 k let a 1 an g 1 n g be the datum for a quantum linear space r r a 1 an 1 n that is 11 12 hold a compatible datum d for g and r consists of a vector 1 n i 0 1 and a matrix ij ij f 1 i j n such that i if anii 1 or ni i 6 then i 0 ii if aiaj 1 or i j 6 then ij 0 definition 5 1 let g be a finite abelian group r a quantum linear space and d a compatible datum keep the notation above let p g r d be the algebra group gradings and actions of pointed hopf algebras

algebra structure on p g r d is given by g g g xi xi 1 ai xi 1 k 1 i j n s g g 1 s xi a 1 i xi 1 k 1 i n one can also say that h is generated by its group g g h of group likes which is abelian and the set of 1 ai primitive xi for some element ai g i 1 n these elements satisfy the above relations 16 17 18 in these relations 1 n are multiplicative characters i g f ni o i ai 6 1 if one denotes qi i ai then ni is the order of qi in the group f the elements i and ij are subject to the compatibility conditions i ii just before definition 5 1 finally the number n of generators of the quantum vector space r is called the rank of the hopf algebra p g r d remark 5 2 let p g r d act on an algebra a so that for some i 1 n the action of xi is nonzero if g acts trivially on a then i g 1 if ai acts trivially then xi acts trivially too this follows by proposition 3 1 and by 11 5 1 inner actions of pointed hopf algebras p g r d in this section we study the actions of pointed hopf algebras of rank one on matrix algebras we set h p g r d as above theorem 5 3 let u h a define an inner action of a hopf algebra h on a matrix algebra a then for each i 1 k there is a function i g f such that for any g g one has 19 u g u xi u g 1 i g u xi i g u ai one can choose u so that g 0 that is 20 u g u xi i g u xi u g for all g g the action remaining the same proof note that since g is abelian we have ai g a g ai a for any g g a a thus u g u ai xu ai 1 u g 1 u ai u g xu g 1 u ai 1 now let us compute g xi a i g xi g a in terms of the inner action via the map u h a we have g xi a u g u xi a u ai au ai 1 u

the right by u g we obtain u g 1 u ai 1 u g u xi i g u g 1 u ai 1 u xi u g a a u g 1 u ai 1 u g u xi g u g 1 u ai 1 u xi u g since a is arbitrary and a central simple there is i g f such that u g 1 u ai 1 u g u xi g u g 1 u ai 1 u xi u g i g 1 a u g u xi u g 1 i g u xi i g u ai proving 19 if g 1 g 2 g then u g 2 u xi i g 2 u xi u g 2 i g 2 u ai u g 2 23 u g 1 u g 2 u xi i g 2 u g 1 u xi u g 2 i g 2 u g 1 u ai u g 2 since u g 1 g 2 is a scalar multiple of u g 1 u g 2 we can write u g 1 g 2 u xi i g 1 g 2 u xi u g 1 g 2 i g 1 g 2 u ai u g 1 g 2 u g 1 u g 2 u xi i g 1 g 2 u xi u g 1 u g 2 i g 2 u

by g 1 to 24 we obtain i g 2 i g 1 u xi u g 1 i g 2 i g 1 u a u g 1 i g 2 u g 1 u ai i g 1 i g 2 u xi u g 1 i g 1 g 2 u a u g 1 it follows that i g 2 i g 1 u ai u g 1 i g 2 u g 1 u ai i g 1 g 2 u ai u

i g since i ai 6 1 it follows that once i a 0 all i g 0 now if we replace u xi by u xi u xi ai 1 i ai then we will have u ai u xi i ai u xi u ai our calculation shows that then also u g u xi i g u xi u g for all g g as claimed group gradings and actions of pointed hopf algebras 11 an important consequence of this theorem is the following corollary 5 4 let a hopf algebra h with a group of group likes g and g g act on a matrix algebra a let a g a be the associated g grading of a if x is a 1 a primitive element in h for some a g and g is such that gx g x for all g g then u x a let h p g r d as above theorem 5 5 let u h a define an inner action of a hopf algebra h on a matrix algebra a then there is i f such that the following relation holds for the elements u ai and u xi of the algebra a 26 u xi ni i 1 a iu ai ni proof this is an application of the q binomial formula 18 lemma 3 let ly rz a a denote the left respectively right multiplications by y respectively z in the algebra a then we can rewrite the action of x on any a a in equation 9 as xi a lu xi lu ai ru ai 1 ru xi a hence xnii a lu x lu a ru g 1 ru x ni a setting lu x lu a ru a 1 ru x we get lu ai ru ai 1 ru xi lu xi lu ai lu

u xi nia 1 niu ai nirni u ai 1 u xi a u xi nia 1 nir u ai 1 u xi nia now u ai 1 u xi ni q ni ni 1 2 i u xi niu ai ni so taking into account that 1 niq ni ni 1 2 i 1 for any natural ni we get i a u ai niau ai ni i 1 a ni i a u xi nia u ai niau ai niu x ni this can be rewritten as au ai ni i 1 a u xi ni u ai ni i 1 a u xi ni a since a is central simple and a a is arbitrary there is i f such that u

relations hold for the elements of the inner action of h p g r d on a matrix algebra a defined by the convolution invertible map u h a for any 1 i j n there exist ij f such that 27 u xj u xi j ai u xi u xj ij 1 a iju ai u aj proof for the proof we are going to use the defining relation 18 we compare the action of xjxi i aj xixj with the action of ij 1 aiaj on the elements of a let g be the group of

lusztig s kernel and so on not only do they give the necessary but also they give sufficient conditions for the actions of h on matrix algebras although it seems impossible to classify all sets of matrices satisfying all the relations given in these theorems some interesting examples can still be provided this is done in the remainder of the paper 5 2 matrix form for the actions of pointed hopf algebras of rank 1 with cyclic group of group likes let g be a cyclic group generated by an element g of orderm with the group of charactersg then there is g such that g a primitive mth root of 1 let r be a quantum torus of rank 1 with the compatible datum d a x where a g g such that q a 6 1 n o q in the hopf algebra h p g r d we have generators g x such that gx g xg and xn 1 an if an 1 or n 6 we must have 0 otherwise any hopf algebra is isomorphic to the one with either 0 or 1 the algebras with 0 are sometimes called of nilpotent type let us consider the action of such h on a matrix algebra a then a end v where v is a finite dimensional g graded vector space over f v g v if f a then f a a as a result x a a we can always choose u g so that u g m i it was shown in theorem 5 3 that u x can be chosen so that u g u x u g 1 g u x so u x a there is a primitive mth root of 1 f and a vector space decomposition v m 1 s 0 vs such that u g vs s idvs let be the order of and m r we rearrange the subspaces vs so that 32 v r 1 t 0 wt where wt 1 k 0 vt kr 14 bahturin and montgomery then each wt is invariant with respect to u x which follows from u g u x ru x u g in an appropriate basis the restriction u x t of u x to each wt has the form 33 u x t 0 0 0 u t 1 u t 21 0 0 0 0 0 u t 1 0 where each u t i 1 i is a rectangular d t k 1 d t k matrix of rank r t i here dim vt kr d t k and r t i rank u t i 1 i further restrictions on u x appear when one uses theorem 5 5 and compares u x n with idv u g n first assume that one of the conditions an 1 or n 6 holds then h is nilpotent we have u x n u a n now n is a divisor of and if n 6 which is the same as n 6 we must have simply u x n 0 because u a n is diagonal and u x n does not have nonzero diagonal blocks also if n hence n and an 1 then u a n is a scalar matrix and hence u x n is a scalar matrix so in this case u x n i is a scalar matrix it is hard to say much if 0 but if 6 0 then u x is a nonsingular map one easily concludes the all the maps u 21 u 32 u 1 are isomorphisms indeed the entries of u x t n are all cyclic permutations of u 21 u 32 u 1 since u x t n is a nonzero scalar matrix we have rank u x t n d t 1 d t if d t k is the smallest of the sizes of these blocks then the rank of each diagonal entry is at most this number it follows that all vt kr have the same dimension and all the blocks are nonsingular by an appropriate choice of the bases in these subspaces we may assume that u x t has the form 34 u x t 0 0 0 idt idt 0 0 0 0 0 idt 0 if we assume that both an 6 1 and n then we either have xn 0 or xn 1 an in the first case u x n u a n in the second u x n i u a n for some f in both cases on each wt the action of idv u a n is scalar with the coeffi cient t tn at the same time u x t n is a block diagonal matrix with blocks of the same size as those for u a if t 0 then u x t n 0 and we cannot say much more otherwise the same argument as the one leading to 34 works and we have that 35 u x t 0 0 0 tidt idt 0 0 0 0 0 idt 0 the results obtained above can be summarized as follows group gradings and actions of pointed hopf algebras 15 theorem 5 7 let a hopf algebra h p g r d with g g r f x be defined by gm 1 gx g xg and xn 1 an suppose h acts on a matrix algebra a end v then the action is inner via u h a there is an mth primitive root of 1 such that v m 1 i 0 vi where vi is an eigenspace for u a with eigenvalue i if m nr then v r t 0 wt each wt being invariant under both u g and u x in an appropriate basis of wt the matrix of u x has the form of 33 while the matrix of u a is scalar with coefficient t kr if h is nilpotent then either u x n 0 or u x takes the form 34 if h is not nilpotent and u x acts on wt in a nonsingular way then the matrix u x t of this restriction takes the form of 35 remark 5 8 note that up to some change of generators which we discuss at the beginning of section 7 this applies to all but one types of pointed hopf algebras of dimension p 3 from the classification in 1 the exceptional case a from that paper is discussed in section 5 3 1 the actions in the case of the popular taft algebras 11 are discussed in detail in section 6 5 3 actions of h and division gradings let h act on a matrix algebra a g g h g g a g x a 1 a primitive element satisfying gx g x and q a is of order n 6 1 suppose the action of g on a makes a a graded division algebra let t g be the support of the grading since the grading is division t is a subgroup whose order is a square m 2 where m 2 hence m are the divisors of the order of g the grading is accompanied by an alternating bicharacter t t f the basis of a is formed by the elements x t x o i and x x x x for all t also o is the order of in the group g as mentioned earlier the action of g g is conjugation by a matrix u g xf g such that f g g for any t from proposition 5 3 it follows that u g u x u g 1 g u x g u a we know that u x u x 1 a u a satisfies u g u x u g 1 g u x if we write u x t x then t xf g x t g x xf g t f g x xf g t g x xf g comparing like terms on both sides of the above equation and considering f g g we find g g thus 6 0 implies g g for all g hence u x x as a result 36 u x x 1 a xf a the value of the coefficient of xf a is unimportant so we simply write u x x xf a now we need to check that xn and 1 an act ona in the same way the necessary and sufficient conditions for this are given in proposition 5 5 i u x n u a n note that if an e or n 6 then 0 otherwise can be arbitrary but 16 bahturin and montgomery actually one can only consider the cases 0 or 1 let us start with the case 0 in this case one should have x xf a n xnf a using the q binomial formula we get nxn nxnf a nxnf a this shows that there was no need to view u x in its general form x xf a rather than simply u x x so we can continue as follows nxn nxnf a so n f an is a necessary condition in this case since is arbitrary this condition is also sufficient now let 1 so that an 6 e and n in this case we have i nx n nxnf a hence 1 n i nxnf a so we see that this can happen only when f an which is the same as an acts trivially on a it follows that if such a hopf algebra acts on a graded division algebra this action cannot be faithful even if we consider only group like elements theorem 5 9 let h p g r d be a pointed hopf algebra of rank 1 with admissible data d a o a n let g be the group of characters on g assume that the action of g on a matrix algebra a makes a a g graded division algebra with support t in any extension of this action of g to h we must have u x x for some f if 6 t then the action of x is zero if t and n f a n then extensions always exist with any f if 0 this condition is also necessary if 1 in which case n and an 6 e the extensions exist even if an acts non trivially in this case n 1 the actions via u x x and u x x are isomorphic if and only if 5 3 1 an example of a p 3 algebra in this section we consider the division actions of an algebra which is example a in the classification of pointed hopf algebras of dimension p 3 in 1 given an odd prime number p 2 this is an algebra of the form tp fzp in other words this is a pointed hopf algebra h of the type described in section 5 where g g h is an elementary abelian p group g f given by g h 1 0 let us consider the action of h on a matrix algebra a where the action of g g h induces a grading by g which is a division grading we have g where g h 1 g 1 h the grading is completely defined by an alternating bicharacter g g f given by where is a pth primitive root of 1 in this case a mp f is generated by the clock and shift matrices x and x and as mentioned earlier we may assume group gradings and actions of pointed hopf algebras 17 x diag 1 2 p 1 x 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 these matrices satisfy xp x p i and x x x x using proposition 5 3 we can say that the degree of u x is and so there is scalar f such that u x x now and so u x x as for u g and u h these can be found when we consider that the actions of g and h are conjugation by the matrices xf g and xf h given by x x xf g x x 1 f g f g x y x xf h x x 1 f h f h x so we must have f g g for all g similarly f h h for all g taking and f g k f h r s we easily find that f g where and f h r where r 1 as a result we may choose u g x and u h x where proposition 5 10 let h be a pointed hopf algebra of the form tp fzp if h acts on a matrix algebra a so that the induced grading by g h is a division grading then a mp f and the action is isomorphic to an inner action via a convolution invertible map u h a such that for some 1 p and f the matrices for the inner action are given by u g x u h x where and u x x for different pairs the actions are not isomorphic 5 4 actions of h p g r d and mixed gradings let us use the notation and some facts from section 3 suppose a hopf algebra h p g r d acts on a matrix algebra a in this case a becomes a g graded algebra in this section we will look at the action of one of the xi which we denote by x we also set ai a and i indices i j will not be used in the sense of definition 5 1 we set d d 1 ds and view our algebra a as a kronecker product a md f d the action of g is conjugation by u g given in 4 to determine u x we view this matrix as block diagonal according to the above splitting of d with coefficients in d then we can write 37 u x t u x and u 1 i j s u ij u ij being an i j th block of u ij as we know from theorem 5 4 for any g g we must have u g u x u g 1 g u x where is the selected character of g we have u g u x u g 1 i g u ij 1 j g g x g u ij x since g is arbitrary the only terms u ij of u x that survive in 37 are those for which i 1 j or i j 1 we can formulate the result so far obtained as follows 18 bahturin and montgomery proposition 5 11 let h as above act on a matrix algebra a so that the associ ated g grading of a is mixed we keep the notation used in this section then the inner action of h on a can be so chosen that u g 1 g id 1 xf g s g ids xf g g g u x 1 i j s uij x ij if ij 1 i j t in each block row or column of u x there is at most one block different from zero proof only the last claim needs proof but if we have 1 i j t and 1 i k t then 1 j k t which is impossible in some cases more can be said case 1 an interesting particular case is where t in this case only the elements u ii can be nonzero also as a result we must have u x u 11 x uss x or u x u x x where the grading of u x i equals subcase a let us first assume that the datum from definition 5 1 equals 0 that is xn 0 then as we know we must have u x n i for some if 6 0 then we must also have n and then unii idi for all i 1 s thus we may assume that in this case u x u x x where the nth power of u x is the scalar matrix if n 6 this case is not possible if 0 then u x n 0 subcase b let us consider the case where 6 0 then we have xn 1 an we know that in this case we must have an 6 e and n actually by theorem 5 5 i u x n u a n for some f since n we have un 11 x u n ss x id x 1 a n id 1 xf an s a n ids xf an if f an then for any t we must have f an 1 or that xf an commutes with any x t thus xf an x in this case we must have unii 1 i a nidi for all 1 i s thus the nth power of each uii is a scalar matrix but this time if i a n 1 the matrix uii is nilpotent otherwise it is semisimple if f an 6 then we must have 0 and diag u 11 uss n i this case is quite similar to subcase a where 0 except that u x is a nonsingular semisimple matrix with eigenvalues being nth roots of 1 case 2 generally assume that k 1 is the order of in g t remember v is a right graded vector space over a graded division algebra d with the support t we know that u x can be so chosen that u x maps v to v for all g we know that v g v let w t v then v g tw let us denote by k the order of in g t assume k 1 choose supp the sum u w w k 1 is direct we have u x w i w i 1 for i 0 k 1 and u x w k 1 w by an appropriate choice of bases over d we can ensure that the matrix for p u x on u is k k block diagonal with only nonzero blocks pi 1 i which are matrices with coefficients in d moreover the blocks p 2 1 p 3 2 pk k 1 can be group gradings and actions of pointed hopf algebras 19 chosen to have all their entries in the base field f the last matrix pk 1 is the ma trix of the map u x w k 1 w if e k 1 1 e k 1 dk 1 is a basis in w k 1 consisting of the elements of degree k 1 and e 01 e 0 d 0 consisting of the ele ments of degree then because say deg u x e k 1 1 k and u x e k 1 1 is a linear combination of homogeneous elements e 01 e 0 d 0 of degree with coefficients in d all these coefficients must be homogeneous of degree k t hence equal to the multiples of x k thus we have that all pi 1 i are of the forms yi 1 i and p 1 k must have the form of y 1 x k next we have to take 6 1 k 1 and repeat the process finally the matrix of u x will be the sum of the blocks corresponding to u where runs through all representatives of the cosets of the subgroup s of g generated by and t now if we raise the block corresponding to u to the power of k we will obtain diag z 1 x k zk x k where zi yiyi 1 yi 1 for all i 1 2 k as earlier we first assume that the datum from definition 5 1 equals 0 hence xn 0 then as we know we must have u x n i for some if 6 0 then we must also have n and then z n k i idi for all i 1 s thus all zi are non singular also in this case as in section 5 2 we may assume y 2 yk i while y 1 z x k as a result in this case we have u x k diag z x k z x k k raising to the power n k we find that zn k i as a result in this case 0 and u x n i 6 0 if t g s the u x can be reduced to the sum of blocks of the form 38 0 0 0 z x k idt x 0 0 0 0 0 idt x 0 here z is a matrix individual for each coset of g s such that zn k i the determination of the canonical form for u x in the cases 0 and u x n 0 as well as in the case 1 is even more technical so we leave this for a future research 6 action of tn on mm f the goal of this section is the classification of the actions of tn on m 3 f we will apply the results of section 5 2 possible forms for u x are 34 and 33 but we give a more direct treatment here so we have h tn and a mm f endv where is an nth primitive root of 1 and dimv n since g is cyclic of order n generated by an element g the grading by g on a is elementary that is induced from the grading of v g v now we know that u x can be chosen so that u x a where g also u x n i for some f this says that either u x is semisimple nonsingular or u x is nilpotent now u x v v so if there is supp v such that 6 suppv then u x v 0 in this case u x is a nilpotent otherwise u x is semisimple as a result we have two cases as follows 20 bahturin and montgomery case i v n 1 i 0 v i or case ii there are 1 t g such that v splits as the direct sum of both g and x invariant nonzero subspaces v i v i v i v i k 1 such that v i k 0 in case i we the matrices for u g and u x have the following form u g g id 0 0 0 0 g id 1 0 0 0 n 1 g idn 1 where is any element of g 39 u x 0 0 0 0 u 0 n 1 u 10 0 0 0 0 0 u 21 0 0 0 0 0 0 un 1 n 2 0 we know that u x n i for some f if 6 0 then arguing as in section 5 2 we will obtain u x 0 0 0 id id 0 0 0 0 id 0 0 0 0 id 0 where d is the common dimension of all v we can state it as follows theorem 6 1 let u tn mm f define an inner action tn onmm f such that u x is nonsingular then d n m is an integer and there exists f such that the action is isomorphic to the one where u g id 0 0 0 id 0 0 0 n 1 id u x 0 0 0 id id 0 0 0 0 id 0 0 0 0 id 0 two actions with different values of are not isomorphic otherwise if 0 we can conjugate u x in the form 39 by the block di agonal matrix t diag t 1 tn then each block uj 1 j will be replaced by tj 1 uj 1 jt 1 j this allows one to assume we can assume that in the matrix of u x i all blocks uj 1 j have the form where only the first rj 1 rows are different from zero where rj 1 is the rank of uj 1 j in case ii the matrices of u g and u x split into the blocks determined by v ti 1 v i we will write u g i and u x i for the ith blocks of u g and u x group gradings and actions of pointed hopf algebras 21 then u g i i g id 0 0 0 0 i g id 1 0 0 0 i k 1 g idk 1 also u x i 0 0 0 0 0 u 10 0 0 0 0 0 u 21 0 0 0 0 0 0 uk 1 k 2 0 here d 0 d 1 dk 1 are the dimensions of v i v i v i k 1 if we conjugate by the block diagonal matrix t diag t 0 tk 1 then u g i does not change while in u x i each block uj j 1 will be replaced by tjuj j 1 t 1 j 1 6 0 1 actions of tn on m 3 f let a m 3 f h tn n 3 a primitive nth root of 1 the action of g via matrix u g q makes a a zn graded algebra ai a qaq 1 ia we also set p u x and choose p is such a way that qp pq as a result p is of degree 1 it easily follows from the isomorphism criterion proposition 4 2 that we have only three nontrivial options for q case 1 q k diag 1 ki 2 where 0 k n case 2 q p q diag 1 p q where 0 p q n in case 1 the trivial component of the grading is the sum of two matrix sub algebras e 1 ae 1 e 2 ae 2 where e 1 e 11 and e 2 e 22 e 33 other components of the grading are a k e 1 ae 2 and ak e 2 ae 1 so if k 6 1 mod n then p 0 if k 1 then p e 2 pe 1 if k n 1 then p e 1 pe 2 in both cases the action will not change if we conjugate both q and p by a matrix t of the form t diag a d where a f and d m 2 f computing p tpt 1 we obtain p e 1 apd 1 e 2 in the first case and p e 2 adp e 1 in the second clearly we can choose t so that p gets the form p 1 e 31 and in the second p 2 e 13 case 2 this time the components of the grading area 0 span e 11 e 22 e 33 other components are ap span e 21 a p span e 12 aq span e 31 a q span e 13 ap q span e 23 aq p span e 32 if none of the num bers p q p q is congruent 1 mod n we have to set p 0 we can write p as follows p e 12 e 23 e 31 we can conjugate p by any nonsingular diagonal matrix t diag a b c we have p tpt 1 a b e 12 b c e 23 c a e 31 if one or two of the numbers equal zero then the remaining numbers can be made equal 1 which gives 6 pairwise nonisomorphic options for p p 3 1 e 21 p 3 2 e 32 p 3 3 e 13 p 3 4 e 21 e 32 p 3 5 e 32 e 13 p 3 6 e 13 e 21 in the case where all three of the numbers are nonzero which is only possible if n 3 the best we can do is to reduce p to p 3 e 21 e 32 e 13 where is a nonzero number since p 3 3 i for different values of the actions are not equivalent 22 bahturin and montgomery theorem 6 2 if n 6 3 then any action of tn on m 3 f is isomorphic to one of the inner actions via u h m 3 f where the pair u g u x is one of the following q 1 p 1 q n 1 p 2 q 1 n 1 p 3 i i 1 6 if n 3 then we can also have q 1 2 p 3 f all these actions are pairwise non isomorphic 7 actions of d tn on mm f the drinfeld double of a taft algebra is a particular case of algebras p g r d defined in section 5 we will use the following presentation of the drinfeld double h d tn of the taft algebra tn in the case where n is an odd number 1 as an algebra h is generated by g x g x where g g are group likes and x x are skew primitives and gn gn 1 xn xn 0 gg gg gx 1 xg gx 1 xg gx xg gx xg xx xx 1 gg x x 1 g x x x 1 g x generally it is possible in the definition of p g r d to replace some of the variables xi to xia 1 i and ai to a 1 in that case the relations 18 between an old and new xi xj will change to xjxi xixj g g the relations between two old and two new variables will looks the same way in particular this can be done with the generators of the drinfeld double to get xx xx g g in the next result we will show the connection between elements of the inner action when this change of old to new takes place proposition 7 1 let u h a provides an inner action of a hopf algebra h on a central algebra a suppose that x x a 1 x is a a 1 primitive element of h a a grouplike let x 1 xa 1 then x 1 x 1 a 1 a 1 x 1 and 40 u x u x 1 u a i and u x 1 u x u a 1 u a for some f proof let a be an arbitrary element of a we compute the action of x 1 on a in two different ways using formulas 8 9 10 then x a u x au a 1 au x u a 1 x 1 a u x 1 a u a 1 au a u x 1 since x x 1 a we have x a x 1 u a au a 1 u x 1 u a au a 1 u a 1 u a au a 1 u a u x 1 as a result we have u x au a 1 au x u a 1 u x 1 u a au a 1 au a 1 u a u x 1 then u x u x 1 u a au a 1 a u x u a 1 u a 1 u a u x 1 or u x u x 1 u a a a u x u x 1 u a since a is central there is f such that u x u x 1 u a i from this equation both equations 40 are immediate group gradings and actions of pointed hopf algebras 23 the above proposition is important because in distinction from definition 5 1 where all skew primitive elements are 1 a primitive in some real life example like algebras of dimension p 3 in 1 some skew primitive elements are 1 a primitive and some are b 1 primitive the above proposition allows one to switch in our formulas for the inner actions from one type of skew primitive elements to the other without repeating similar arguments note that the additional summand u a 1 and i in 40 can be ignored when computing the action of x and y this fact was proved in lemma 4 1 7 1 inner actions of d tn if a is an h algebra then we have g 1 g 1 1 and x 1 x 1 0 finally for any a b a we have g ab g a g b g ab g a g b x ab x a b g a x b x ab x a b g a x b if a is a matrix algebra there is a map u h a such that for any a a we have h a u h au h 1 for any h g g h x a u x a u g au g 1 u x x a u x a u g au g 1 u x in the case where the group g g h of grouplikes of a hopf algebra h acting on a matrix algebra a mm f is not cyclic we need to consider the gradings on the matrix algebras which do not need to be elementary now g g h g n g n zn zn the dual group g consists of pairs of characters g g each such pair can be identified with the pair k of numbers modulo n we have a ak if and only if g a ka g a a it follows from the defining relations that x ak ak 1 l 1 and x ak ak 1 l 1 for example if the action of g is not faithful then the action of both x and x is trivial the proof of lemma 3 2 works both for x and x similarly with g in place of g at the same time it is possible that the action of gg is trivial and x x still act in a non trivial way actually in this case one speaks about the actions of h uq sl 2 see section 8 note that in this case according to proposition 3 1 the support of the grading is a subgroup of g equal to the annihilator of gg which is a cyclic subgroup isomorphic to zn so the gradings lifted from h uq sl 2 must be elementary the following proposition is a direct consequence of theorems 5 3 5 5 5 6 proposition 7 2 if h d tn acts on a matrix algebra a then the action is inner and the matrices of the inner action can be chosen so that 41 u g u x u g 1 1 u x u g u x u g 1 1 u x 42 u g u x u g 1 u x u g u x u g 1 u x and 43 u x u x u x u x i u g u g for some constant f if the accompanying grading by g is not elementary then 44 u x u x u x u x i 24 bahturin and montgomery proof it follows from 44 that if the grading is not elementary then all matrices on the left hand side as well as i have degree while u g u g has degree different from see 4 as a result in this case we must have a more restrictive relation 44 let us define a character g f by setting g 1 g the sufficient conditions for the action of d tn on mm f will now look like u g n im u g n im u h u x h u x u h u h u x 1 h u x u h for any h g u x n i u x n i f u x u x u x u x i u g u g f an explicit form for of the division actions of d tn can be given as follows first if x and x act nontrivially then by theorem 3 1 the support of the grading cannot be a proper subgroup of g so if g o o n then also t we also need to fix an alternating bicharacter t t f this is done by fixing a primitive nth root of 1 say now as we concluded above u x x 1 while u x x for some f it follows from 44 that u x u x u x u x 1 i i thus we must have 1 1 now to determine u g and u g we should act exactly as in section 5 3 1 easy calculations show that we must have u g and u g be scalar multiples of u g x and u g x where is uniqely defined by one easily checks for example u g u x u g 1 x 1 x 1 x 1 x 1 1 1 x 1 x 1 x 1 1 u g an explicit example for n 3 looks like the following fix a 3 rd primitive root of 1 and consider two options if 2 then u g 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 u g 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 u x 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 u x 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 0 if then group gradings and actions of pointed hopf algebras 25 u g 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 u g 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 u x 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 u x 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 we also must have 1 1 7 2 mixed actions of d t 2 in this section we will use the following notation for the sylvester pauli matrices in the case n 2 a 1 0 0 1 b 0 1 1 0 c 0 1 1 0 then if d t 2 acts on r m 2 k f such that the grading by g is mixed the matrices of the inner action can be chosen as follows u g ik a u g ik b the commutation relations 41 and 42 will now take the form u g u x u x u g u g u x u x u g u g u x u x u g u g u x u x u g it is now easy to compute the matrices u x and u x 45 u x p c u x q c for some p q mk f using 44 we get the following i 2 k u x u x u x u x p c q c q c p c pq qp i 2 46 pq qp ik note that if t glk then one can conjugate r by t i 2 without changing the grading this allows one to reduce say p to a canonical form p 1 tpt 1 and find q 1 tqt 1 from the equation p 1 q 1 q 1 p 1 ik one also needs to remember that p 1 c 2 p 21 i 2 and q 1 c 2 q 21 i 2 are scalar matrices so in our future calculations we may assume that p and q are matrices satisfying 46 their squares are scalar matrices and p is in the normal jordan form case 1 one of p q is nilpotent say p 2 0 set j 0 1 0 0 then we can take p in the form p p 0 0 0 where p diag j j r easy calculation using 46 show that p must be the whole of p it will be more convenient to write 47 p 0 ir 0 0 where k 2 r 26 bahturin and montgomery in the above formula zeroes are zero r r matrices we also writeq q 11 q 12 q 21 q 22 where each qij is an r r matrix if we plug p and q as just above to 46 we will obtain q 21 q 11 q 22 0 q 21 ir 0 0 ir then q q 11 q 12 ir q 11 to further simplify u x q c we can conjugate this matrix by any matrix whose conjugation maps u g i 2 k a and u g i 2 k b to their scalar multi ples by 1 and u x to u x u g see lemma 4 2 if one writes the conjugating matrix as t ti i ta a tb b tc c then the condition t i 2 k a t 1 i 2 k a and t i 2 k b t 1 i 2 k b implies that t must be one of ti i ta a tb b tc c if we now conjugate u x p c by one of these matrices then first of all we must have 0 and also depending on what matrix has been chosen tip pti tap pta tbp ptb and tcp ptc in the case where tp pt using 47 we find that t t 11 t 12 0 t 11 in the case tp pt we have t t 11 t 12 0 t 11 here t 11 glr and t 12 mr f thus in both cases we can conjugate first by a matrix where t 11 ir and the conjugate by t t 11 0 0 t 11 before we do this we remember that q 2 ik for some f hence ik q 211 q 12 q 11 q 12 q 12 q 11 0 q 211 q 12 as a result q 12 q 2 11 ir and q q 11 q 2 11 ir ir q 11 if we conjugate this matrix by t ir t 12 0 ir where 1 we will obtain the following tqt 1 q 11 t 12 q 11 t 12 t 2 12 q 2 11 ir t 12 q 11 ir t 12 q 11 if we set t 12 q 11 then tqt 1 0 ir ir 0 proposition 7 3 if d t 2 acts on mm f so that u g does not commute with u g and u x is nilpotent then m 2 k and the action is isomorphic to precisely one inner action where u g ik a u g ik b u x 0 ir 0 0 c u x 0 ir ir 0 c group gradings and actions of pointed hopf algebras 27 for some f proof this follows if in the preceding argument we use conjugation by a matrix t i 2 where t ir t 12 0 ir also our argument about possible shapes for the conjugating matrix t shows that different produce non isomorphic actions case 2 p 2 ik q 2 ik 6 0 choose f such that xi 2 then after conjugation by a matrix t i 2 which does not change the actions by u g and u g we can reduce p to p ir 0 0 is let apply 46 to p as just above and q x y z u where the blocks have the sizes r r r s s r and s s then ir 0 0 is x y z u x y z u ir 0 0 is ir 0 0 is in this case 2 x ir 2 y is and we can assume q 1 2 ir y z is let us also remember q 2 ik were 6 0 then im 1 4 ir y z 0 0 zy is hence y z 4 1 ir zy 4 1 is unless 4 1 0 it follows that r s and y z zy 1 4 1 ir in this latter case any further reductions can only be provided by the matrices of the form t k 0 0 l or u t 0 ir ir 0 we have 48 k 0 0 l ir y z ir k 1 0 0 l 1 ir ky l 1 lzk 1 ir one can choosek and l so thatky l 1 ir now in general lzk 1 ky l 1 1 4 1 ir thus with the latter choice of k and l we should have and so lzk 1 1 4 1 ir and q ir ir 1 4 1 ir ir as a result in the case where 4 6 1 we have k 2 r and for a choice of xi with xi 2 u g ik a u g ik b u x ir 0 0 ir c u x ir ir 1 4 1 ir ir c it is easy to see that for different choices of of and the actons parametrized by these constants are not isomorphic remember 2 now let us consider the remaining case where y z zy 0 using our cal culation in 48 which is true also when r 6 s we will reduce q to the form 28 bahturin and montgomery q ir ky l 1 lzk 1 is where now 49 ky l 1 lzk 1 ky l 1 lzk 1 0 for appropriate k and l we can assume ky l 1 it 0 t s t 0 r t t 0 r t s t for some t r s from 49 we then find lzk 1 0 t t 0 t r t 0 s t t where is a rectangu lar s t r t matrix in this case we still have as one of the parameters of the action but instead of one parameter we have an s t r t array of parameters so if we set y r s t it 0 t s t 0 r t t 0 r t s t and z r s 0 t t 0 t r t 0 s t t then the last family of the actions is given by u g ik a u g ik b u x ir 0 0 is c u x ir z r s y r s t is c proposition 7 4 if d t 2 acts on mm f so that u g does not commute with u g and u x is not nilpotent then m k and the action is isomorphic to an inner action where u g ik a u g ik b u x ir 0 0 is c u x ir z r s y r s t is c two such actions with parameters r s t and r s t are isomorphic if and only if r r s s t t and there is u gls f such that u u 1 thus we have obtained a full classification of non elementary actions of d t 2 on mn f where f is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero 7 3 general elementary actions of the drinfeld double we now examine the elementary actions of the drinfeld doubles d tn in the case n 2 on the algebras of the form a endv v a finite dimensional vector space over the base field f containing nth roots of 1 letm dimv note that by 43 we always have u x u x u x u x i u g u g because the grading by g is elementary we have 50 v gv and u h g h for any h g here we denote by the projection of v onto v now let g be a uniquely defined character such that g g 1 then as we know u h u x u h 1 h u x and u h u x u h 1 1 h u x group gradings and actions of pointed hopf algebras 29 for all h g it then follows that u x a and u x a 1 any graded component a of a consists of linear transformations a satisfying a v v for any g if t is the cyclic subgroup of order n generated by the space v is split as the sum of subspaces v g t which are invariant under the action of u g u g u x u x we have v v if we fix any and set v k v k for k 0 1 n 1 then u x v k v k 1 and u x v k v k 1 we know that there exist f such that u x n im u x n im in what follows we restrict ourselves to the case when one of u x u x is nonsingular let us assume 6 0 in this case as we ve seen earlier in section 5 2 for any g fixed the dimensions of all v k are the same let us set fk k 1 u x k and gk k 1 u x k now fk 1 fk 1 fk k so all fk are isomorphisms let dimv k r if we choose a basis b 0 in v 0 and set bk fk b k 1 for any k 1 2 n 1 then we will obtain a basis b b 0 bn 1 such that the matrix for u x v will have the form 0 0 0 0 ir ir 0 0 0 0 0 ir 0 0 0 0 0 0 ir 0 to determine u x note that the subspaces v are invariant under all u x u x u g u g this allows us to use the relations for these matrices derived earlier for the restrictions to each of these subspace for instance we will have gk 1 gk 1 gk k let us use u x u x u x u x i u g u g restricted to v we have n 1 k 0 fk 1 gk gk 1 fk n 1 k 0 1 k gg k or n 1 k 0 fk 1 gk gk 1 fk n 1 k 0 1 2 k gg k let us set k 1 2 k gg then for each k 0 1 n 1 we will have fk 1 gk gk 1 fk k k this relation allows us to express all gk in terms of one of them once f 0 fk 1 is known for any k 0 1 n 1 we will have gk f 1 k 1 gk 1 fk k f 1 k 1 30 bahturin and montgomery using the above basis b for v let us denote by vij the block diagonal matrix for u x in this basis and uij the matrix for u x we have u x 0 v 12 0 0 0 0 v 23 0 0 0 0 vn 1 n vn 1 0 0 0 then vk 1 k u 1 k k 1 vk k 1 uk 1 k k u 1 k k 1 we already know that the only nonzero blocks in this matrix are uk 1 k for k 0 n 1 and uk 1 k ir if k 1 n 1 while u 0 n ir as a result we will obtain the recurrent matrix relation vk 1 k vk k 1 kir for k 1 n 2 and vn 1 0 1 v 0 1 nir vn 2 n 1 vn 1 0 n 1 ir this recurrent relation enables us to express all blocks of the matrix of the restriction u x to v by a single one say v 0 n 1 moreover if we conjugate all matrices in question by any diag t t t where t is a non singular square matrix of order r then the matrices for u g u g u x remain the same while we may assume that v 0 n 1 is a matrix in a jordan normal form 8 actions of h uq sl 2 we adopt the following presentation of h uq sl 2 from 1 h is generated by the elements a x y such that an 1 xn yn 0 ax 2 xa ay 2 ya xy yx a a 1 51 here n is an odd number n 3 the coproducts are given by x x a 1 x y y 1 a 1 y a a a here is a primitive nth root of 1 n an odd number suppose h acts on a matrix algebra a then the action is inner via a convo lution invertible map u h a and given by the formulas below where a is any element of a a a u a au a 1 x a u x au a 1 au x u a 1 y a u y a u a 1 au a u y 52 proposition 8 1 the elements u a u x u y a on the right hand sides of the equations in 52 can be so chosen that 53 u a n 1 54 u a u x 2 u x u a group gradings and actions of pointed hopf algebras 31 55 u a u y 2 u y u a 56 u x n 1 u y n 1 57 u x u y u y u x u a u a 1 where 6 0 f proof note that actually h is an algebra of the type described in the definition 5 1 if we set g a x 1 xa 1 a 1 a 1 x 2 y a 2 a 1 1 a 2 2 a 2 we also have n 1 n 2 n 1 2 0 hence x n 1 x n 2 0 also x 2 x 1 1 a 2 x 1 x 2 yxa 1 1 a 1 xa 1 y 58 yxa 1 2 xa 1 y yxa 1 xya 1 59 a 1 a a 1 1 a 1 a 2 60 it follows that 12 1 notice also that 1 a 2 2 a 1 1 as needed in definition 5 1 now one can apply theorems 5 3 5 5 5 6 to get our needed relations 53 54 55 56 57 the main tool here is proposition 7 1 for example for any g g we have u g u x 1 u g 1 1 g u x 1 so that u a u x 1 u a 1 2 u x 1 using proposition 7 1 we get u a u x u a 2 u a 1 2 u x u a 1 2 u a 1 u a u x u a 1 2 u x 1 2 i as claimed as another example u x 2 u x 1 1 a 2 u x 1 u x 2 1 12 u a 1 u a 2 u y u x u a 1 2 u x u a 1 u y 1 12 u a 1 u y u x u x u y u a 12 u a 1 u x u y u y u x u a 12 u a 1 as needed 8 1 book hopf algebra one more hopf algebra which is a part of the classi fication of hopf algebras of dimension p 3 p is an odd prime number in 1 is the so called book hopf algebra h q m where q is p th root of 1 and m zp 0 in terms of generators and defining relations generators and defining relations this algebra is given by h q m a x y axa 1 qx aya 1 qmy ap 1 xp 0 yp 0 xy yx 0 the coproduct is given by the following a a a x x a 1 x y y 1 am y the following is very similar by the statement and the proof to proposition 8 1 32 bahturin and montgomery suppose h acts on a matrix algebra a then the action is inner via a convo lution invertible map u h a and given by the formulas below where a is any element of a a a u a au a 1 x a u x au a 1 au x u a 1 y a u y a u a mau a mu y 61 proposition 8 2 the elements u a u x u y a on the right hand sides of the equations in 61 can be so chosen that 62 u a n 1 63 u a u x qu x u a 64 u a u y qmu y u a 65 u x n 1 u y n 1 66 u x u y u y u x u a m where 6 0 f proof again in the same way as in proposition 8 1 we note that the algebra in question is an algebra from definition 5 1 after this our relations 62 63 64 65 66 follow with the use of theorems 5 3 5 5 5 6 and proposition 7 1 8 2 actions on m 2 f as an example of the results in the previous section we consider the action of h uq sl 2 on a m 2 f first of all there is a basis of the underlying vector space f 2 where u a 1 0 0 k for f satisfying n 1 1 k n if u x a b c d then u a u x u a 1 2 u x that is a n kb kc d 2 a 2 b 2 c 2 d since we assume n 3 we must have a d 0 we also must have n kb 2 b and kc 2 c thus if none of k n k equals 2 the action of x is trivial this also follows by proposition 3 1 since the computation for u y is similar in the case none of k n k equals 2 the action of h is purely a group action so is just a grading by g zn since also n 6 4 only one of k n k equals 2 let us first look at the case k 2 in this case u x 0 0 p 0 u y 0 q 0 0 for some p q f clearly they satisfy all 53 to 56 so we need only to see what restrictions are imposed by 57 we have qp 0 0 pq 1 0 0 2 1 n 2 thus 2 1 2 1 n 2 and pq 2 n 2 1 n 2 similar is the case n k 2 group gradings and actions of pointed hopf algebras 33 if n 4 then k 2 and we have u x 0 p q 0 u y 0 r s 0 for some p q r s f again we need to check 57 it follows from 57 that ps qr 0 0 qr ps 1 1 0 0 2 since 2 1 it follows that any u x u y can be chosen and 57 will be satisfied with ps qr this enough freedom to produce different actions of h on a it would be good to determine the equivalence classes of actions 8 3 actions of drinfeld doubles of the taft algebra via the actions of uq sl 2 an alternate approach to the results in section 7 can be given as follows see 15 corollary 4 8 we use the notation from 12 ix 6 first it is well known that uq sl 2 is a hopf homomorphic image of d h for h tn 2 by setting q 2 and defining d h uq as follows g 7 k g 7 k 1 x 7 f and x 7 ek 1 q q 1 e moreover ker d h kg where g is the cyclic subgroup generated by gg corollary 8 3 each action of uq sl 2 on an algebra a lifts to an action of the drinfeld double d tq on a via the homomorphism shown above thus any action of uq sl 2 on mn f can be obtained from an elementary action of d tq described in section 7 3 with an additional provision that in 50 the summation is taken over the characters g such that gg 1 note that the converse is not true no division action of the drinfeld double d tq comes as a lifting of an action of the uq sl 2 because g and g do not act as inverses of each other for more specific examples see the formulas
