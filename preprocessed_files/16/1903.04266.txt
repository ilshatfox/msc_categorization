conjectured that a noncommutative domain must contain a free multiplica tive noncyclic subsemigroup he verified the conjecture when the center is un countable in this note we consider the existence or not of free subsemigroups in associative k algebras r where k is a field not algebraic over a finite subfield we show that r contains a free noncyclic subsemigroup in the following cases 1 r satisfies a polynomial identity and is noncommutative modulo its prime radical 2 r has at least one nonartinian primitive subquotient 3 k is uncountable and r is noncommutative modulo its jacobson radical in particular 1 and 2 ver ify klein s conjecture for numerous well known classes of domains over countable fields not covered in the prior literature in 1977 lichtman conjectured that the group of units of a noncommutative divi sion algebra always contains a noncyclic free subgroup 12 since then an extensive broad and ongoing literature has developed on the existence of free subobjects of as sociative algebras the reader is referred e g to 9 for an overview of this literature and e g to 7 and references therein for more recent results our focus in this note is on free subsemigroups of associative algebras hence forth references to free subsemigroups and free subgroups will assume them to be multiplicative and noncyclic in 1984 makar limanov conjectured that a noncom mutative division algebra must contain a free subsemigroup and he proved the same for division algebras over uncountable fields 14 in 1992 klein proved that a non commutative domain with an uncountable center must contain a free subsemigroup and he conjectured the same for all noncommutative domains 10 chiba proved in 1995 that a polynomial extension of a division algebra must contain a free subsemi group and also that a division algebra over an uncountable field must contain a free subgroup 5 in 1996 reichstein showed that an algebra over an uncountable field contains a free subsemigroup or subalgebra if the same holds true after an extension of the scalar field 18 cf smoktunowicz s constructions 19 our primary aim then is to establish the existence of free subsemigroups for some well known classes of algebras not covered in the prior literature 2010 mathematics subject classification primary 20 m 25 16 u 99 secondary 20 m 05 key words and phrases subsemigroup free semigroup associative algebra

them to be associative and unital finitely generated k algebras will be referred to as k affine we begin with an elementary but useful specialization lemma adapted from passman 16 2 2 lemma let a be a subring of a ring r and suppose there exists a surjective ring homomorphism a a if a contains a free subsemigroup then so does r proof choose x y a that generate a free subsemigroup s of a choose x 1 x and y 1 y letting s denote the subsemigroup of a generated by x and y we see that restricts to a surjective semigroup homomorphism from s onto s mapping x to x and y to y by universality s must be isomorphic to s and so s is a free subsemigroup of r 3 let n be an integer 1 in view of the tits alternative 20 and recalling that k is not algebraic over a finite subfield we can conclude that gln k contains a free subgroup therefore the full matrix algebra mn k contains a free subgroup as does the algebra of n n matrices over any k algebra lichtman 13 and gonc alves 8 used the tits alternative to verify that a noncommutative division algebra finite dimensional over its center must contain a free subgroup we can now conclude that a noncommutative central simple algebra finite dimensional over a field extension of k must contain a free subgroup the proof of the following employs a reduction to the k affine case and i am grateful to ken brown for this approach 4 theorem let r be a k algebra satisfying a polynomial identity and suppose that r is noncommutative modulo its prime radical then r contains a free subsemigroup proof by 2 we may assume without loss of generality that r is a noncommutative semiprime pi algebra over k choose x y r such that b xy yx 6 0 next since r is semiprime and pi it follows that rbr cannot be a nil ideal see eg 15 13 2 6 i consequently there exist a 1 c 1 a 2 c 2 at ct r such that d a 1 bc 1 a 2 bc 2 atbct is not nilpotent set r k x y b a 1 c 1 at ct a k affine not necessarily semiprime pi alge bra since d is not nilpotent the ideal r br of r is not nil but it was proved by amitsur that the jacobson radical of a k affine pi algebra must be nil 1 nilpo tency was later established by braun 3 therefore r br cannot be contained in the jacobson radical of r hence xy yx is not contained in the jacobson radical of r and we can conclude that r is noncommutative modulo its jacobson radical we now know that there exists at least one primitive ideal p of r such that r p is noncommutative and so by kaplansky s theorem see e g 15 13 3 8 free subsemigroups 3 r p must be a noncommutative central simple algebra finite dimensional over a field extension of k therefore by 3 r p contains a free subsemisubgroup and by 2 r contains a free subsemigroup 5 theorem let r be a k algebra with at least one nonartinian primitive subquotient then r contains a free subsemigroup proof to start assume that r is both left primitive and not artinian let m be a simple faithful left r module and let e endrm since r is not artinian it follows that m has infinite length as a right e module also for any given integer n 1 it follows from the jacobson density theorem that there exists a k subalgebra a of r equipped with a surjective homomorphism a mn e see e g 11 11 19 again by 3 the subalgebra mn k of mn e a must contain a free subsemigroup the theorem now follows from 2 6 remark observe that the preceding two results 4 and 5 verify klein s conjecture when r is a nonartinian primitive domain or when r is a noncommutative pi domain moreover those two results especially when k is countable establish the existence of free subsemigroups in numerous well known classes of algebras not covered in the prior literature indeed algebras with a nonartinian primitive subquotient or that are semiprime and pi are commonplace among iterated ore extensions cf 15 enveloping algebras of lie algebras cf 6 group algebras cf 17 quantum groups cf 4 and algebras arising in nocommutative algebraic geometry cf 2 we can also use 5 to show that makar limanov s conjecture over k is equivalent to an a priori more general statement 7 corollary the following two statements are equivalent i every noncommuta tive division algebra over k contains a free subsemigroup ii every k algebra non commutative modulo its jacobson radical contains a free subsemigroup proof it suffices to prove that i implies ii so assume i and let r be a k algebra noncommutiative modulo its jacobson radical to prove the corollary it will suffice to show as follows that r contains a free subsemigroup first by 2 we can assume without loss of generality that r is primitive and noncommutative next by 5 we can further reduce to the case when r is simple artinian now if r has rank n 1 then r contains a copy of mn k and so contains a free subsemigroup by 3 it remains only to consider the case when r is a division ring which is exactly i we conclude with a modest application to algebras over uncountable fields 8 corollary assume that k is uncountable and that r is noncommutative modulo its jacobson radical then r contains a free subsemigroup proof as noted above it was proved in 14 that a division algebra over an uncount able field contains a free subsemigroup the corollary now follows from 7 4 edward s letzter acknowledgement i am grateful to ken brown for his very useful comments on an earlier draft of this note and in particular for his
