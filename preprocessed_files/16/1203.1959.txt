representation theory of the quantum weyl algebra at an lth primitive root of unity boyette leyk plunkett sipe and talley found all nonsingular irreducible matrix solutions to the equation yx xy 1 assuming yx 6 xy in this note we complete their result by finding and classifying up to equivalence all irreducible matrix solutions x y where x is singular 1 introduction let k be an algebraically closed field a nonzero scalar in k the irreducible representations of the quantized weyl algebra a k x y yx xy 1 has been constructed and classified in 2 and 3 it is well known that when is a root of unity any irreducible representation of a is finite dimensional in 1 boyette leyk plunkett sipe and talley present a linear algebra method to prove the drozd guzner ovsienko result in the case when is a primitive root of unity let v be an a module and a end v mn k be a representation of a then is irreducible i e v is simple if and only if a mn k their approach then is to find explicitly up to equivalence all irreducible matrix solutions to the equation yx xy 1 with yx 6 xy two n n matrices x and y form a matrix solution if y x xy i the identity matrix a solution x y is irreducible if every matrix in mn k can be written as a noncommutative polynomial in x and y over k assuming the zero power of a matrix is the identity matrix two solutions x y and m n are equivalent if there is a nonsingular matrix q such that qxq 1 m and qy q 1 n throughout is an lth primitive root of unity for some integer l 2 unless specified otherwise any solution is a matrix solution to the equation yx xy 1 1 1 nonsingular solutions suppose x y is an irreducible solution and u y x xy 6 0 the following are proved in 1 i y x l x ly and y lx xy l and so x l and y l are scalar matrices it follows that any irreducible matrix solutions is at most l l 2010 mathematics subject classification 16 d 60 81 r 50 key words and phrases quantum weyl algebra representations matrix equations the first author was

least l l iii when x has at least one nonzero eigenvalue all irreducible solutions are l l and found explicitly in 1 as follows x 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 l y b s 1 1 b 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 b 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 l 1 bl 1 bl 0 0 0 1 1 l where b s are nonzero scalars in k the two matrices in each of these solutions are both nonsingular these solutions are corresponding to the x y torsion free simple a modules cf 3 summary 3 7 however for an irreducible solution x y it is not always true thatx has nonzero eigenvalues for example when l 2 1 the matrices x 0 1 0 0 and y 0 0 1 0 form an irreducible solution to the equation yx xy 1 in fact this solution gives the only simple a module where a k x y yx xy 1 that is both x and y torsion cf 3 example 4 1 hence the remark ii in 1 and the assertion in 1 proposition 2 are incorrect in this note we complete 1 proposition 2 by finding up to equivalence all irreducible matrix solutions x y where x only has zero eigenvalue moreover the two types of irreducible matrix solutions with x nonsingular or singular are classified up to equivalence these irreducible solutions give explicitly all irreducible representations of the quantum weyl algebra at the root acknowledgement this problem arose in conversations between the second author and her ph d advisor e letzter the authors are thankful for his generosity the authors are also grateful to the referee for the comments that lead to lemma 2 4 2 irreducible matrix solutions with x singular direct computation shows that the following is a solution irreducible representations by matrix solutions 3 2 1

note that x is the well known upper shift matrix and x l 0 fix a positive integer u l 1 then xu is a matrix with uth superdiagonal line all ones and zeroes elsewhere premultiplying a matrix a by xu results in a matrix whose last u rows are all zeroes and the first l u rows are the last l u rows of the matrix a ii note that each yk k 1 along the subdiagonal line of y is the only nonzero entry on the kth row of y fix a positive integer v l 1 it follows that y v l k 0 k 6 l v l j l v 1 l j i 0 i k l v that is the only nonzero entry on the lth row of the matrix y v is y v l l v 2 2 proposition the solution x y in 2 1 is irreducible proof let h span k x iy j 0 i j l 1 for any positive integers m n l we will show that the elementary matrices emn are in h for fixed integers m n l consider the matrix x l my l n by 2 1 i the last nonzero row of x l my l n is the mth row which is the same as the lth row of the matrix y l n by 2 1 ii the only nonzero entry in the lth row of y l n is y l n l n l j n 1 l j i 0 i hence x l my l n l j n 1 l j i 0 i emn m 1 s 1 l t 1 x l my l n s t est when m 1 we have x l 1 y l n l j n 1 l j i 0 i e 1 n for n 1 l then by induction on m it shows that any emn h

l y s l 1 l l 2 l 1 2 3 2 1 l 2 i 0 i l 2 l 2 4 3 2 0 l 3 i 0 i 2 5 4 3 0 0 1 l l 1 0 0 0 1 l where i are scalars in k for i 1 2 l proof suppose that a b with ba 6 ab is an n n irreducible solution for some positive integer n and that the only eigenvalue of a is 0 let c qaq 1 be the jordan canonical form for a where q is an n n matrix set d qbq 1 then c d is also an irreducible solution suppose the jordan blocks ji in c are mi mi for i 1 k partition the matrix d into blocks dij where dij are mi mj matrices for 1 i j k then we have diiji jidii 1 for i 1 2 k fix i let dii dpq mi mi note that along the diagonal line of the matrix diiji jidii should be all ones i e 1 0 d 21 1 d 21 d 32 1 dmi 1 mi 2 dmi mi 1 and 1 dmi mi 1 it then follows that 1 2 mi 1 0 but is an lth primitive root of unity thus mi must be an integer multiple of l hence n i mi must be greater than or equal to l it then follows from 1 1 i that c has to be the l l jordan block with zeroes on the diagonal line i e c qaq 1 x now it is sufficient to show that d qbq 1 must have the form y s it follows from ba ab 1 that dx xd 1 we will explore the problem element wise by 2 1 i we have dx ij di j 1 j 1 0 j 1 and xd ij di 1 j i l 0 i l since i 1 6 1 and j 1 6 l it is clear that d 1 l is a free variable case 1 i j fix 1 k l 1 the kth superdiagonal line of dx xd has entries dx xd i i k di i k 1 di 1 i k for i 1 2 l k that is d 1 k 1 d 2 k 0 d 2 k d 3 k 1 0 dl k l 1 dl k 1 l 0 then inductively di i k 1 l kdl k 1 l for i 1 2 l k therefore on the lth column of d we get free variables d 2 l dl 1 l irreducible representations by matrix solutions 5 case 2 i j we have 1 dx xd ii 0 d 2 1 i 1 di i 1 di 1 i 1 i l dl l 1 0 i l thus the entries on the subdiagonal line of d are d 21 1 l 2 i 0 i d 32 d 21 1 l 3 i 0 i dl 1 l 2 1 and dl l 1 1 case 3 i j we have 0 dx xd ij 0 di 1 1 j l and j i l dl j 1 i l and 1 j i di j 1 di 1 j i l and 1 j i it is not hard to see inductively that dij 0 for any 2 i l and 1 j i 2 the proposition follows 2 4 lemma any solution x y s in 2 3 is equivalent to a solution x y in 2 1 the equivalence classes of solutions in 2 3 are x y for k proof suppose x y is a solution as in 2 1 direct computation shows that the following uppertriangular matrix p is a nonsingular matrix such that p 1 xp x p 1 pl 1 pl 2 p 2 p 1 1 pl 1 p 3 p 2 1 pl 1 1 l l where pk are scalars in k for k 1 l 1 then the matrices x and p 1 y p also form a solution it is shown in the proof of 2 3 that if x d is a solution then d must be one of the form y s thus p 1 y p y s for some 1 l consider the matrices py s and y p the second row of y p is l 2 i 0 i 1 pl 1 p 1 set y s be the lower right l 1 l 1 block of the matrix y s and r be the l 1 l matrix obtained by removing the last row of the matrix x then the second row of py s can be written as 0 1 pl 1 p 2 y s l 2 i 0 i 0 0 1 pl 1 p 2 y sr 6 blaise heider and linhong wang it then follows from py s y p that l 2 i 0 i pl 1 p 1 1 pl 1 p 2 y s note that y s is the sum of the upper triangular matrix m l 2 l l 3 l 1 3 2 0 l 3 l 4 3 0 0 l l 1 0 0 0 l and the l 1 l 1 subdiagonal matrix l with entries l 3 i 0 i 1 1 along the diagonal line then we have l 2 i 0 i 1 pl 1 p 1 1 pl 1 p 2 l 1 pl 1 p 2 m and so l 2 pl 1 l 3 1 pl 2 l 3 i 0 i p 2 l 2 i 0 i p 1 1 pl 1 p 2 m therefore pl 1 l pk l 1 k i 0 i 1 k 1 l 1 i k 1 l k 1 i pi for k l 2 1 moreover it follows from py s 1 l y p 1 l that 1 l 1 i 1 l 1 i pi this shows that any solution x y s is equivalent to a solution x y for some in k the equivalence condition is given by a polynomial condition on s and that can be obtained inductively from and simply arguing by determinant we have the equivalence classes are x y for k the preceding lemma shows that up to equivalence the only irreducible solution with both determinants equal to zero is the solution x y 0 this solution corre sponds to the only x and y torsion simple module l 0 over the quantum weyl algebra a at the root cf 3 example 4 1 next we provide the equivalence classification for irreducible solutions found in 1 which are corresponding to the x and y torsion free simple a modules irreducible representations by matrix solutions 7 2 5 lemma any solution x y b s in 1 1 iii is equivalent to a solution x y where y 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 l 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 l for some k the equivalence classes of solutions in 1 1 iii are x y where k and k proof let x y b s and x y c s be two irreducible solutions as in 1 1 iii they are equivalent only if l l and l i 1 bi l i 1 ci suppose i for some 1 i l then by using an appropriate permutation matrix we have x i y i b s is equivalent to x y b s where the entries b s in y i b s and those in y b s are the same up to the corresponding permutation it then remains to show that x y b s is equivalent to x y where l i 1 bi this can be done by using a diagonal matrix p with entries 1 b 1 b 1 b 2 b 1 bl 1 along the diagonal line combining proposition 2 3 lemma 2 4 1 1 iii and lemma 2 5 we have 2 6 proposition 2 theorem 5 8 any irreducible solution a b to the equation yx xy 1 in which ba 6 ab is equivalent to either the solution x y in 2 5 or the solution x y in 2 1 references 1 j
