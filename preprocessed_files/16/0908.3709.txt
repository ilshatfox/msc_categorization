of polytopes originating in the study of higher categories and homotopy theory while the multiplihedra may be unfamiliar to the algebraic combinatorics community it is nestled between two families of polytopes that certainly are not the permutahedra s and associahedra y the maps s m y reveal several new hopf structures on tree like objects nestled between the hopf algebras ssym and ysym we begin their study here showing that msym is a module over ssym and a hopf module over ysym rich structural information about msym is uncovered via a change of basis using mo bius inversion in posets built on the 1 skeleta of m our analysis uses the notion of an interval retract which should have independent interest in poset combinatorics it also reveals new families of polytopes and even a new factorization of a known projection from the associahedra to hypercubes re sume les multiplihe dra m mn n 1 formez une famille des polytopes provenant de l e tude des cate gories plus e leve es et de

hypercubes introduction in the past 30 years there has been an explosion of interest in combinatorial hopf algebras related to the classical ring of symmetric functions this is due in part to their applications in combinatorics and representation theory but also in part to a viewpoint expressed in the elegant commuting diagram nsym ssym sym qsym date 25 august 2009 key words and phrases multiplihedron permutations permutahedron associahedron binary trees hopf algebras sottile supported by the nsf grant dms 0701050 1 http arxiv org abs 0908 3709 v 1 2 stefan forcey aaron lauve and frank sottile namely much information about an object may be gained by studying how it interacts with its surroundings from this picture we focus on the right edge ssym qsym we factor this map through finer and finer structures some well known and some new until this edge is replaced by a veritable zoo of hopf structures a surprising feature of our results is that each of these factorizations may be given geometric meaning they correspond to successive polytope quotients from permutahedra to hypercubes the known cast of characters let us reacquaint ourselves with some of the char acters who have already appeared on stage ssym the hopf algebra introduced by malvenuto and reutenauer 13 to explain the isomorphism qsym nsym a graded noncommutative noncocommutative self dual hopf algebra with basis indexed by permutations it offers a natural setting to practice noncommutative character theory 4 ysym the dual of the hopf algebra of trees introduced by loday and ronco 11 a graded noncommutative noncocommutative hopf algebra with basis indexed by planar binary trees it is important for its connections to the connes kreimer renormalization procedure qsym the hopf algebra of quasisymmetric functions introduced by gessel 9 in his study of p partitions a graded commutative noncocommutative hopf algebra with basis indexed by compositions it holds a special place in the world of combinatorial hopf algebras 1 the new players in this extended abstract we study in detail a family of planar binary trees that we call bi leveled trees which possess two types of internal nodes circled or not subject to certain rules these objects are the vertices of stasheff s multiplihedra 18 originating from his study of a categories the multiplihedra were given the structure of cw complexes by iwase and mimura 10 and realized as polytopes later 8 they persist as important objects of study among other reasons because they catalog all possible ways to multiply objects in the domain and range of a function f when both have nonassociative multiplication rules more recently they have appeared as moduli spaces of stable quilted discs 14 in section 2 we define a vector space msym with basis indexed by these bi leveled trees we givemsym a module structure for ssym by virtue of the factorization ssym msym ysym evident on the level of planar binary trees and a splitting msym ssym we also show thatmsym is a hopf module for ysym and we give an explicit realization of the fundamental theorem of hopf modules that is we find the coinvariants for this action our proof sketched in section 3 rests on a result about poset maps of independent interest we conclude in section 4 with a massive commuting diagram containing several new families of planar binary trees that further factors the map from ssym to qsym the remarkable feature of this diagram is that it comes from polytopes some of them even new and successive polytope quotients careful study of the interplay between the algebra and geometry will be carried out in future work 1 basic combinatorial data 1 1 ordered and planar binary trees we recall a map from permutations s nsn to planar binary trees y n yn that has proven useful in many contexts 19 12 hopf structures on trees 3 its behavior is best described in the reverse direction as follows fix a tree t yn the n internal nodes of t are equipped with a partial order viewing the root node as maximal an ordered tree is a planar binary tree together with a linear extension of the poset of its nodes these are in bijection with permutations as the nodes are naturally indexed left to right by the numbers 1 n the map takes an ordered tree permutation to the unique tree whose partial order it extends example 1 the permutations 1423 2413 and 3412 share a common image under 1 4 2 31 4 1 32 4 1 23 there are two right inverses to that will be useful later let min t respectively max t denote the unique 231 avoiding 132 avoiding permutation mapping to t under loday and ronco show that 1 t is the interval min t max t in the weak bruhat order on the symmetric group 12 thm 2 5 and that min and max are both order preserving with respect to the tamari order on yn 1 2 bi leveled trees and the multiplihedra we next describe a family of bi leveled trees intermediate between the ordered and unordered ones these trees arrange them selves as vertices of the multiplihedra m nmn a family of polytopes introduced by stasheff in 1970 18 though only proven to be polytopes much later 8 stasheff intro duced this family to represent the fundamental structure of a weak map f between weak structures such as weak n categories or an spaces the vertices ofmn correspond to as sociations of n objects pre and post application of f e g f a f b f c and f a f bc this leads to a natural description ofmn in terms of painted binary trees 5 but we use here the description of saneblidze and umble 16 a bi leveled tree is a pair t c with t yn and c n designating some nodes of t as lower than the others indexing the nodes from left to right by 1 n viewing t as a poset with root node maximal c is an increasing order ideal in t where the leftmost node is a minimal element graphically c indexes a collection of nodes of t circled according to the rules i the leftmost node is circled and has no circled children ii if a node is circled then its parent node is circled define a map from sn tomn as follows given a permutation 1 2 n first represent as an ordered tree next forget the ordering on the nodes save for circling all nodes i with i 1 example 2 consider again the permutations 1423 2413 and 3412 of example 1 viewed as ordered trees their images under are distinct 4 2 31 4 1 32 4 1 23 7 denote by the map from bi leveled trees to trees that forgets which nodes are circled the map helps define a partial order on bi leveled trees that extends the tamari lattice on planar binary trees say that the bi leveled tree s precedes the bi leveled tree t in the partial order if s t and the circled nodes satisfy ct cs we call this the weak order on bi leveled trees see figure 1 below for an example the equality is evident remarkably this factorization s m y 4 stefan forcey aaron lauve and frank sottile figure 1 the weak order onm 4 the bi leveled trees on 4 nodes extends to the level of face maps between polytopes see figure 2 our point of departure was the observation that it is also a factorization as poset maps figure 2 and extend to face and poset maps from the permu tahedra to the associahedra the distinguished vertices 1234 1234 and 1234 are indicated 1 3 dimension enumeration fix a field k of characteristic zero and let ssym denote the graded vector space n 0 ssymn whose n th graded piece has the fundamental basis f an ordered tree in sn definemsym and ysym similarly replacing sn by mn and yn respectively we follow convention and say that ssym 0 and ysym 0 are 1 dimensional by contrast we agree that msym 0 0 see 7 for categorical rationale briefly stasheff sm 1 is already 0 dimensional som 0 has no clear significance hopf structures on trees 5 in section 2 we give these three vector spaces a variety of algebraic structures here we record some information about the dimensions of the graded pieces for later reference hilbq ssym n 0 n qn 1 q 2 q 2 6 q 3 24 q 4 120 q 5 1 hilbq msym n 1 anq n q 2 q 2 6 q

q 5 4 we will recover this with a little algebra in section 2 3 the positivity of the quotient of 1 by 3 is established by 3 theorem 7 2 2 the hopf module msym let and be the maps between the vector spaces ssym msym and ysym induced by and on the fundamental bases that is for permutations and bi leveled trees t we take f f f f ft f t below we recall the product and coproduct structures on the hopf algebras ssym and ysym in 13 and 11 these were defined in terms of the fundamental bases departing from these definitions rich structural information was deduced about ssym ysym and the hopf algebra map between them in 2 3 this information was revealed via a change of basis from fundamental to monomial using mo bius inversion we take the same tack below withmsym and meet with similar success 2 1 the hopf algebras ssym and ysym following 3 we define the product and coproduct structures on ssym and ysym in terms of p splittings and graftings of trees a p splitting of a tree t with n nodes is a forest sequence of p 1 trees with n nodes in total this sequence is obtained by choosing p leaves of t and splitting them and all parent branchings right down to the root by way of example consider the 3 splitting below where the third leaf is chosen twice and the fifth leaf is chosen once t t 0 t 1 t 2 t 3 denote a p splitting of t by t g t 0 tp the grafting of a forest t 0 t 1 tp onto a tree with p nodes is also best described in pictures for the forest above and s 213 the tree 6 stefan forcey aaron lauve and frank sottile is the grafting of t 0 t 1 tp onto s denoted t 0 t 1 t 2 t 3 s splittings and graftings of ordered trees are similarly defined one remembers the labels originally assigned to the nodes of t in a p splitting and if t has q nodes then one increments the labels of s by q in a grafting t 0 t 1 t 2 t 3 s see 3 for details definition 3 fix two ordered or ordinary trees s and t with p and q internal nodes respectively we define the product and coproduct by 5 ft fs t g t 0 t 1 tp f t 0 t 1 tp s and ft t g t 0 t 1 ft 0 ft 1 in the coproduct for ordered trees the labels in t 0 and t 1 are reduced to be permutations of t 0 and t 1 2 2 module and comodule structures we next modify the structure maps in 5 to give msym the structure of left ssym module and right ysym hopf module given a bi leveled tree b let b g b 0 bp represent any p splitting of the underlying tree together with a circling of all nodes in each bi that were originally circled in b definition 4 action of ssym onmsym for w s and s mp write b w and set fw fs b g b 0 b 1 bp f b 0 b 1 bp s 6 where the circling rules in b 0 b 1 bp s are as follows every node originating in s is circled whenever b 0 0 otherwise every node originating in b w is uncircled this action may be combined with any section of to define a product on msym for example f f f f f f f f theorem 5 the action ssym msym msym and the productmsym msym msym are associative moreover putting msym 0 k they make into an algebra map that factors unfortunately no natural coalgebra structure exists on msym that makes into a hopf algebra map definition 6 action coaction of ysym onmsym given b m let b g b 0 bp denote a p splitting satisfying b 0 0 for s yp set 7 fb fs b g b 0 b 1 bp f b 0 b 1 bp s and fb b g b 0 b 1 fb 0 f b 1 where in b 0 b 1 bp s every node originating in s is circled and in b 1 all circles are forgotten example 7 in the fundamental bases ofmsym and ysym the action looks like f f f f f hopf structures on trees 7 while the coaction looks like f f 1 f f f f f f f f 1 f f f f f f f f the significance of our definition of will be seen in corollary 11 our next result requires only slight modifications to the original proof that ysym is a hopf algebra due to the restricted p splittings theorem 8 the maps msym ysym msym and msym msym ysym are associative and coassociative respectively they givemsym the structure of ysym hopf module that is fb fs fb fs 2 3 main results we next introduce monomial bases forssym msym and ysym given t mn define mt t t t t ft where is the mo bius function on the poset mn define the monomial bases of ssym and ysym similarly see 13 and 17 in 3 the coaction in this basis is particularly nice but we need a bit more notation to describe it given t mp and s yq let t s denote the bi leveled tree on p q internal nodes formed by grafting the root of s onto the rightmost leaf of t theorem 9 for a bi leveled tree t the coaction on mt is mt t t s mt ms example 10 revisiting the trees in the previous example the coaction in the monomial bases looks like m m 1 m m m m 1 m m m m recall that the coinvariants of a hopf module m over a hopf algebra h are defined by m co m m m m 1 the fundamental theorem of hopf modules provides that m m co h the monomial basis of msym demonstrates this isomorphism explicitly corollary 11 a basis for the coinvariants in the hopf module msym is given by mt t t where t comprises the bi leveled trees with no uncircled nodes on their right branches this result explains the phenomenon observed in 4 it also parallels corollary 5 3 of 3 to an astonishing degree there the right grafting idea above is defined for pairs of planar binary trees and used to describe the coproduct structure of ysym in its monomial basis 3 towards a proof of the main result we follow the proof of 3 theorem 5 1 which uses properties of the monomial basis of ssym developed in 2 to do the heavy lifting in 3 the section y max s of is shown 8 stefan forcey aaron lauve and frank sottile to satisfy m max t mt and m 0 if is not 132 avoiding this was proven using the following result about galois connections theorem 12 15 thm 1 suppose p and q are two posets related by a galois connection i e a pair of order preserving maps p q and q p such that for any v p and t q v t v t then the mo bius functions p and q are related by v p and t q w 1 t v w p v w s 1 v s t q s t there is a twist in our present situation specifically no galois connection exists between sn andmn on the other hand we are not aiming for an order preserving map m s satisfying m t mt indeed no such map exists rather we find that 1 t m mt 8 this fact is the key ingredient in our proof of theorem 9 its verification required modi fication of the notion of galois connection a relationship between posets that we call an interval retract section 3 2 3 1 sections of the map s m bi leveled trees t are in bijection with pairs s s where s is a planar binary tree with p nodes say and s s 1 sp is a forest sequence of planar binary trees in the bijection s comprises the circled nodes of t and si is the binary tree of uncircled nodes sitting above the i th leaf of s for example t s s a natural choice for a section mn sn would be to say build min s and min si for each i and splice these permutations together in some way to build a word on the letters 1 2 n let mm t denote the choice giving s 1 smaller letters than s 2 s 2 smaller letters than s 3 sp 1 smaller letters than sp and sp smaller letters than s mm mm 4 3 1 1 1 2 3 2 35 1 6 8 7 2 4 56187243 this choice does not induce a poset map the similarly defined mm also fails chosing maximal permutations representing s and s but mm has the properties we need mm 8 2 3 5 6 4 7 1 56487231 we define this map carefully given t yn and any subset s n of cardinality n write mins t for the image of min t under the unique order preserving map from n to s define maxs t similarly hopf structures on trees 9 definition 13 the section mm let t s s be a bi leveled tree on n nodes with p circled nodes write u u 1 up min a b s for a b n p 1 n and write vi max ai bi si 1 i p where the intervals ai bi are defined recursively as follows ap 1 and bp ap sp 1 ai 1 max j i sj and bi ai si 1 finally define mm t by the concatenation mm t u 1 v 1 u 2 v 2 upv p remark 14 alternatively mm t is the unique w 1 t avoiding the pinned patterns 0231 3021 and 2031 where the underlined letter is the first letter in w the first two patterns fix the embeddings of si 0 i p the last one makes the letters in si larger than those in si 1 1 i p the important properties of mm t are as follows proposition 15 the section mn sn given by t mm t is an embedding of posets the map sn mn satisfies t t for all t mn and 1 t sn is the interval mm t mm t 3 2 interval retracts let p q and q p be two order preserving maps between a lattice p and a poset q if t q t t and 1 t is an interval then we say that and demonstrate p as an interval retract of q theorem 16 if p and q are two posets related by an interval retract then the mo bius functions p and q are related by s t q v 1 s w 1 t p v w q s t the proof of theorem 16 exploits hall s formula for mo bius functions an immediate consequence is a version of 8 for any p and q related by an interval retract verifying that mm is an interval retract between sn andmn proposition 15 amounts to basic combinatorics of the weak order on sn 4 more families of binary trees and their polytopes we have so far ignored the algebra qsym of quasisymmetric functions advertised in the introduction a basis for its nth graded piece is naturally indexed by compositions of n but may also be indexed by trees as follows to a composition a 1 a 2 say 3 2 1 4 we associate a sequence of right combs i e trees with ai leaves and all internal leaves rooted to the rightmost branch and left pointing these may be hung on another tree a left comb with right pointing leaves to establish a bijection between compositions of n and combs of combs with n internal nodes 23 32 1214 2 3 3 2 1 2 1 4 10 stefan forcey aaron lauve and frank sottile to see how qsym and the hypercubes fit into the picture we briefly revisit the map of section 1 2 we identified bi leveled trees with pairs s s where s is the tree of circled nodes and s s 0 sp is a forest of trees the uncircled nodes under this identification may be viewed as a pair of maps with the first factor making a planar binary trees out of the nodes greater than or equal to 1 and the second factor making trees out of the smaller nodes 2 1 1 4 1 23 1 2 1 see also figure 3 two more fundamental maps are l and r taking trees to left or right combs e g l and r figure 3 displays several combinations of the maps l and r the algebra qsym corresponds to the terminal object there the set denoted combs comb the new binary tree like structures appearing in the factorization of ssym qsym i e those trees not appearing on the central vertical axis of figure 3 will be studied in upcoming papers it is no surprise that ssym qsym factors through so many intermediate structures what is remarkable and what our binary tree point of view reveals is that each family of trees in figure 3 can be arranged into a family of polytopes see figure 4 the hopf algebraic and geometric implications of this phenomenon will also be addressed in future work references 1 marcelo aguiar nantel bergeron and frank sottile
