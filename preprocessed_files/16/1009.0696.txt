algebra morphism from the local ring of lm at m to a the problem to classify all the deformation equivalence classes of a lie algebra with given base is solved by versal deformations first we give an algorithm for computing versal deformations second we prove there is a bi jection between the deformation equivalence classes of an algebraic lie algebra m r n in lm and its nilpotent radical n in the r invariant scheme l r n with reductive part r under some conditions so the versal deformations of m in lm is deduced to those of n in l r n which is a more simple problem third we study versality in central extensions of lie algebras finally we calculate versal deformations of some lie algebras introduction formal deformation theory of associative algebras and lie algebras over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic zero has been first studied by ger stenhaber 10 nijenhuis and richardson 13 for more information about this topic see 2 8 10 12 13 schlessinger generalized deformation theory from the base k t to a commutative local k algebra 15 a lie algebra of dimension m is viewed as a point 0 of the scheme lm defined by the jacobi s identities and antisymmetry prolonging these ideas we consider in 6 a deformation of 0 parametrized by a local k algebra a with maximal ideal m as a local k algebra morphism o a with o the local ring of lm at 0 there is a subgroup gm a of the linear group glm a acting on the set of deforma tions def 0 a an interesting and largely open problem is to classify all the deformation equivalence classes with fixed base of a lie algebra considering deformations with any base permits us to simplify this problem in fact this is equivalent to look for deformations called versal g o r with base r supported by the ec project liegrits mcrtn 505078 1 http arxiv org abs 1009 0696 v 1 satisfying that for any deformation h o a with base a there is a local morphism h r a a base change such that h g is equivalent to h and the zariski s tangent space of r is minimal for this property the aim of this paper is to provide an algorithm for computing versal defor mations a theorem called reduction theorem which reduces their computation for a class of algebraic lie algebras and to study versality in central extensions of subschemes of lm in section 1 we give classical material of deformations in this new definition where the properties depend on the k algebra a we introduce the schemes ldn consisting laws which are invariant under d gln k and def 0 a d the set of deformations of 0 l d n k defined by the local ring o d of ldn at 0 we assume that d is completely reducible in gln k the subgroup gn a d of gn a consisting elements which commute with d acts on def 0 a d in section 2 we provide an algorithm for computing versal deformations of 0 this method is based on the fixing some parameters indexed by a set a called admissible set at 0 the bases of versal deformations of 0 are the local rings of slices lam 0 which are transversal subschemes to the orbit of 0 in lm k under glm k in section 3 we give the reduction theorem let g r n be an alge braic lie algebra with reductive part r and nilpotent radical n of dimension n for any noetherian complete local k algebra a there is a bijection between def g a gm a and def n a r gn a r and the local ring of any slice of lm at g is isomorphic to that of any slice of l d n at n for an important class of algebraic lie algebras so the versal deformations of g in lm is deduced to those of n in lrn which is a more simple problem also we provide a new criterion of formal rigidity of 0 saying that if the krull s dimension of the completion local ring of any slice at 0 is zero then 0 is formal rigid under some hypotheses we could limit the local study of g r n in lm to that of n in lrn according to the reduction theorem moreover if the weights of the center t of r were different from zero the scheme lrn would be consisted of nilpotent laws passing from lm to l r n has the advantage to use methods which are specific for nilpotent lie algebras in particular we can use the construction method of nilpotent lie algebras based on successive central extensions then we build in section 4 some sequences of schemes ltn n for n n 0 consisting of nilpotent laws whose their versal deformations are made by successive central extensions from that of n 0 l t n 0 with n 0 the dimension where the maximal torus t appears this leads to a continuous family concept in section 5 we calculate versal deformations of some lie algebras 1 generality 1 1 in this work we consider an algebraically closed field k of characteristic 0 let ei be a basis of v k m a a commutative associative k algebra with unity 1 1 a and lm a the set of all lie a algebra multiplications on a k v an element of lm a is defined by its structure constants k ij a ei ej m k 1 k ijek then the set lm a can be identified with the set of 2 kij a m m 1 2 such that kij k ji 0 j l ijk p s 1 sij l sk s jk l si s ki l sj 0 1 1 it is well known that lm is a functor from the category of commutative associa tive k algebras to the category of sets denote by jm the ideal of the polynomial ring pm k x i generated by the relations 1 1 and im the quotient algebra im pm jm where i kij 1 i j m 1 k m is the set of all multi indices for any k algebras a b let us denote by homalg a b the set of k algebra homomorphisms from a to b let x be the class of x in im the k functor lm is representable by im i e there is a canonical bijection lm a homalg im a f defined by f im a with f x for all commutative associative a giving a point lm a is equivalent to giving an algebra morphism from im to a the k functor lm is an affine al gebraic k scheme with algebra im and we have lm spec im 14 the set of rational points of lm is identified with the set lm k of all lie k algebra multiplications on v 1 2 let a be a local k algebra with maximal ideal m m a residue field k a m augmentation map pr a k and let a denote its m adic comple tion k algebra a deformation of a point 0 of lm k with base a is a point of lm a such that 0 lm pr for all fixed point 0 we obtain a functor def 0 from the category of commutative associative local k algebras to the category of the sets we extend def 0 to a by taking inverse limits if o o 0 is the local ring of the scheme lm at 0 then it is equal to the localization ring of im by the maximal ideal m 0 ker f 0 with f 0 f 0 giving a deformation of 0 with base a is equivalent to giving a k algebra morphism f f im a such that f 0 pr f this is equivalent to f sends m 0 to m then f induces a local morphism from o to a we deduce that giving a deformation of 0 is equivalent to give a local k algebra morphism f o a then the set of deformation def 0 a can be identified with the set of local k algebra homomorphisms homalg o a the case where a k t corresponds to the gerstenhaber s deformations 10 the deformation id o o defined by id x x is called deformation identity or canonical deformation it is an initial universal object in the cate gory of deformations at the point 0 any deformation of 0 with base a may be deduced from the identity deformation by a base change a deformation def 0 a is defined by its structure constants f x the smallest subalgebra of a containing them is equal to f o it is a noetherian local k algebra since it is isomorphic to o ker f next we can assume that a is noetherian let r denote the category of noetherian local k algebras r that of noetherian complete local k algebras 1 3 let f homalg o a be a deformation with a r then for each p 0 its reduction modulo mp 1 is a deformation with base a mp 1 we obtain a map homalg o a limp homalg o a mp 1 1 2 it follows from the bijection 1 2 that for each element f of homloc o a there is a family fp p n with fp homloc o a m p 1 such that f lim fp 3 when p the statement that f forms a deformation is equivalent to lift each local morphism fp to the local morphism fp 1 this is equivalent to the commutativity of the following diagram o fp 1 fp f f f f f f f f f a mp 2 a mp 1 1 3 where is the projection we say that there is a p 1 obstruction if it is impossible to find such a solution 1 4 consider the chevalley eilenberg s complex c g g d with adjoint val ues of a lie algebra g the nijenhuis richardson s bracket of a m cochain f by a q cochain g is the commutator f g f g 1 m 1 q 1 g f it may be checked that df 1 m 1 0 f denote by z m g g bm g g and hm g g the space ofm cocycles m coboundaries andm cohomologies respec tively 13 1 5 let a r if r is the dimension of m m 2 over k we then have a k t 1 tr a with a an ideal if f homalg o a is a deformation its structure constants f x may be written as formal series in generators t 1 tr of m a say t 1 tr with 0 0 0 this defor mation may be written as t nr t with c 2 g g and t t 1 1 t r r this writing is not unique if a 6 0 1 6 let a be a local k algebra and glm a the group of invertible m matrices with coefficient in a the augmentation map pr a k induces a group k morphism denoted again by pr pr glm a glm k its kernel denoted by gm a is a subgroup of glm a equal to id mm m where mm m is the set of matrices with coefficients in m the group glm a canonically acts on lm a by s s s 1 s 1 1 4 i e s kij lpq s 1 li s 1 pj skq q lp 1 5 with s sij glm a and lm a denote by the glm a orbit of the action of the group gm a on homalg o a is given by s f fs o a x k ij 7 s k ij 1 6 with s gm a and f homalg o a two deformations of 0 with base a are said to be equivalent if they lie on the same orbit under gm a denote by def 0 a the set of deformation equivalence classes of 0 with base a a deformation is said to be a trivial if it is equivalent to the constant deforma tion c o a defined by c u f 0 u 1 a where u o a point 0 of lm k is said to be a rigid if each deformation of 0 is a trivial i e def 0 a consists of only one orbit under gm a the notion of a rigidity depends on the base a the geometric rigidity which means that the orbit of 0 under glm k is a zariski s open set in lm k corresponds to the rigidity with base a k t 13 the zariski s tangent space to lm k resp the glm k orbit 0 of 0 4 at 0 identifies with z 2 0 0 resp b 2 0 0 we have h 2 0 0 0 if and only if the glm k orbit of 0 is a zariski s open set in lm k and the scheme lm is reduced at point 0 we suppose that a is complete then each element s of gm a may be written as nr t s with s 0 id and s mm k let k be the smallest length nonzero of such that k t s is nonzero the action of s on a deformation nr t of 0

lm which is canonically isomorphic to spec idm let 0 be a point of l d m k a a local k algebra and let def d 0 a denote the set of deformations of 0 with base a in l d m a the quotient algebra k morphism from im to i d m induces a local algebra k morphism o 0 o d 0 and a scheme embedding from ldm onto lm denoted by i also it induces a map denoted again by i and defined by homalg o d 0 a homalg o 0 a f 7 i f f if 0 is an orbit of a law 0 in lm k we denote by 0 d 0 l d m k its trace in ldm k assume that d is a completely reducible lie subalgebra of gl kn i e its natural representation on v is semisimple the normalizer subgroup h of d in gl kn stabilizes ldm k and the trace orbits since the adjoint representation of d is semisimple hence the lie algebra of h is given by d gl kn d if h 0 is the identity component of h it is proved in 5 that a the zariski s tangent space to ldm k at 0 is equal to z 2 g g d b 0 d is a finite union of orbits under h 0 in l d m k c the zariski s tangent space to 0 d at 0 is equal to that of its orbit under h 0 at 0 it is also equal to b 2 0 0 d d the orbits under h 0 in l d m k are the same that under the identity com ponent gl kn d 0 of the group gl k n d consisting of the elements of gl kn commuting with d e for k c we have h 2 0 0 d 0 if and only if the h 0 orbit of 0 is a zariski s open set in ldm k and the scheme l d m is reduced at

the ideal defined by jm x 0 i i jm it suffices to set x 0 for all i i in the jacobi s polynomials jdabc for a b c n we obtain the jacobi s polynomials in function of coordi nates x i since n remains a

homalg o 0 a f 7 i f f 2 construction of versal deformations in this section we provide an algorithm for computing versal deformations of a lie algebra by fixing some parameters the idea to fix some structure constants of a lie algebra was used in 8 for parameterizing a deformation fuchs and fialowski provide in 9 an algorithm of computation the completion of a base of miniversal deformations based on calculations a basis of hi g g with i 2 3 and their massey products their method is valid if the dimension of h 2 g g is finite but treats only the miniversal case 6 2 1 parametrization of deformations let a r and a basis e i of c 2 v v a deformation i e of 0 or f o a can be written as f x 0 with m a a family of parameters of or f is a family ti 1 i r of the maximal ideal m m f o such that the classes ti modulo m 2 form a k basis of m m m 2 the number of parameters of the deformation is bounded by dimk z 2 0 0 if hk is a complement of bk g g in zk g g and wk a complement of zk g g in ck g g then hk is canonically isomorphic to hk g g and d induces an isomorphism from wk onto bk 1 g g thus we obtain a decomposition ck g g zk g g wk bk g g hk wk 2 1 called decomposition of hodge associated with g the law 0 is a deformation of 0 if and only if is a solution of the maurer cartan s equation mcm m m c 2 g g d 1 2 0 2 2 where the differential d extends to a c g g by ida d and denote it again by d we have d 1 2 d 1 2 b 3 1 2 h 3 1 2 w 3 2 3 where b 3 h 3 w 3 are the projections on m b 3 g g m h 3 and m w 3 respectively set mc m m m c 2 g g d 1 2 b 3 0 we can see mcm m mc m

wk bk 1 set p w 2 b 3 lemma 2 1 there is a unique map g m z 2 g g m w 2 g g with g 0 0 such that mc m m z g z z m z 2 g g proof consider a map f m z 2 g g m w 2 m b 3 g g defined by f z w d w 1 2 z w z w b 3 denote by f b 3 z z 2 and w w 2 the components of f z and w relative to above bases since f is polynomial in variables z and w we may regard f as an element of the ring a z w p of formal power series in variables z z z 2 and w w w 2 we have f 0 0 the jacobian f w 0 is invertible in a since pr f w 0 is invertible in a m k i e d 0 w 2 b 3 is an isomorphism it follows from above and the formal implicit theorem the formal equation f z w 0 admits a solution if and only if there is a unique formal map g g w 2 a z p such that g 0 0 and g z w it is clear that g converges in the m adic sense since a is complete it follows that we define by substituting a map g a z 2 ap by g a 1 a z 2 g a 1 a z 2 which satisfies g m z 2 mp for all 7 it follows from lemma 2 1 that we can define a map m z 2 g g m h 3 z 7 z g z z g z h 3 which is called obstruction map theorem 2 1 there are g and defined as above satisfying g 0 0 0 such that def 0 a 0 z g z z 0 z m z 2 g g proof the element belongs to mcm m iff d 1 2 b 3 0 w 3 0 h 3 0 we shall show that if satisfies h 3 0 d 1 2 b then w 3 0 we suppose that h 3 0 d 1 2 b 3 since 0 d 1 2 and by eq 2 3 it follows that w 3 0 we can check that w 3 d ad w 3 the graded jacobi s identity and the injectivity of d w 2 c 3 g g implies ad w 2 m c 3 g g does it follows that w 3 0 by lemma 2 1 is equal to z g z is equivalent to d 1 2 b 3 0 and we deduce that mcm

a deformation f o r with r r is formal versal if i for any deformation h o a with a r there is a local morphism h r a a base change such that h f is equivalent to h ii the zariski s tangent space of r is minimal for the property i i e dimk m r m 2 r dimk h 2 g g if the maximal ideal m of a in i satisfies m 2 0 is called miniversal in 9 if is the th component of the map gl v c 2 v v defined by s s 0 on the basis e i of c 2 v v then its differential at unit 1 is given by d 1 l l 0 dl l c 1 v v since 1 tl 1 tl 0 0 t l 0 0 l 0 l mod t 2 definition 2 2 a set a is said to be admissible at point 0 if it is a minimal subset of i such that the rank of d 1 a is maximal i e a rank d 0 dimb 2 g g dim 0 remark 2 1 let e i be a basis of c 2 g g from the exchange basis the orem there are parts b i a i such that the e b complete a given basis of b 2 g g to a basis of c 2 g g the set a is the complement of b in i let 0 be a deformation of 0 with m a the parameters a are called orbital parameters at 0 the set a permits to define a subscheme of lm 1 10 as f l a m 0 where the components a are expressed as k linear combinations of x 0 the tangent space 8 t 0 f is isomorphic to h 2 g g and is transversal at the orbit 0 under gm a at 0 f i e the tangent spaces at 0 satisfy t 0 lm t 0 0 t 0 f where the orbit is a reduced scheme and f is called slice associated with a the set of deformations of 0 with base a in the slice l a m 0 is given by defa 0 a lam 0 a pr 0 the functor defa 0 is representable by the local ring o a 0 of lam 0 at 0 if a is an admissible set of i at 0 then the vector subspace v 2 a of c 2 g g generated by e i a is a linear complement of b 2 g g in c 2 g g containing h 2 see remark 2 1 we have defa 0 a 0 v dv 1 2 v v 0 v m v 2 a 2 4 proposition 2 1 for any a r and an admissible set a at 0 then there are two maps g and defined as above satisfying g 0 0 0 such that defa 0 a 0 h g h h 0 h m h 2 proof see theorem 2 1 lemma 2 2 if a is an admissible set at 0 then the map f w v 7 id w 0 v 0 is a bijection from m w 1 m v 2 a g g to m c 2 g g proof let f i v i a and w w 1 be the components of f v and w relative to above bases see section 2 2 we may extend f to an element f of a v w i the ring of formal power series in indeterminates v v i a and w w w 1 we have f 0 0 the jacobian j f v f w 0 is given by j ii a 0 0 d 0 where ii a is the identity matrix of size i a it is easy to check that j is invertible in a since its projection pr j is inversible in a m k d 0 is an isomorphism from w 1 to b 2 g g it follows from above and the formal inversion theorem 2 that the formal map f is bijective it is clear that f converges in the m adic sense since a is complete it follows that f coincides with the associated map f by substituting the indeterminates v and w for the elements of a theorem 2 2 if a is an admissible set at 0 then the map f w 7 id w is a bijection from m w 1 defa 0 a to def 0 a proof let 0 def 0 a with m c 2 g g by lemma 2 2 there are unique elements w m w 1 and v m v 2 a g g such that s 0 v 0 i e s 0 v with s id w hence 0 v s 1 and def 0 a 0 m v 2 a g g defa 0 a 9 corollary 2 1 let a be an element r and a an admissible set at 0 for all deformation def 0 a there exists a in the orbit under gm a such that 0 for all a the local ring oa 0 of l a m 0 at 0 is the quotient of the local ring o 0 of lm at 0 by the ideal ao generated by the m

notation of proposition 2 1 corollary 2 2 for any admissible set a at 0 then 1 o oa 0 is versal 2 the canonical deformation id of 0 in l a m 0 defined by 2 5 may be written on the completing local ring o a 0 as y 0 y g y such that y 0 where runs through the set h 2 the parameters y h 2 are said to be essential proof 1 by corollary 2 1 each deformation h o 0 a with a r is equivalent to a deformation h 0 o 0 a such that h 0 x 0 for all a then h 0 vanishes on the ideal generated by the elements x 0 a so it factorizes through oa 0 there is a local morphism h 0 o a 0 a such that h 0 h 0 it is clear that dimk m o a 0 m 2 oa 0 dimk h 2 g g the statement 2 is coming from proposition 2 1 remark 2 2 the results in this section remain true in lrn by replacing gm a 0 o 0 o a 0 and ck g g to

reduction theorem and formal rigidity 3 1 reduction theorem let g r n 0 be an algebraic lie algebra with n 0 the nilpotent radical of dimension n and r u s a maximal reductive lie subalgebra to construct a versal deformation of a point in lm is a hard problem but in the algebraic case this problem can be reduced from that of 0 in l r n under some conditions the equality of the number of essential parameters of 0 in lm and 0 in l r n is a necessary condition according to corollary 2 2 and remark 2 2 the graded lie algebra morphism i c n n r c g g is defined by the composition of graded differential complex morphisms and defined by 0 c n n r c n g r c n g n r 0 3 1 and c n g r c g g defined by i f r gq 1 0 and i f nq f for each f cq n n r this lemma is left to the reader lemma

that 1 i 1 h 1 n n r h 1 g g is an epimorphism 2 i 2 h 2 n n r h 2 g g is an isomorphism and 13 3 i 3 h 3 n n r h 3 g g is a monomorphism then for every a r a i and a i admissible sets as above the map i from lrn to lm induces i a bijection from def 0 a r to def 0 a defined by 7 ii a local k algebra morphism o 0 o r 0 which induces a local k algebra isomorphism oa 0 o r a 0 for k c such that the following diagram is commutative o 0 or 0 oa 0 or a 0 3 7 proof surjection we shall show that for all deformation def 0 a there is def 0 a r such that and i are equivalent under gm a we will prove for t by induction on the integer p n the following property there are sp id p t s gm a and t def 0 a such that sp i 2 where c 2 n n r for p it is obvious if p 0 we assume that satisfies the induction hypothesis for p the deformation equation can be expressed as 1 2 t 1 t 2 1 2 0 we get 2 t d 0 with 1 2 1 2 1 6 0 2 6 0 1 2 it follows that p 1 t d p 1 t mod t p 2 3 8 from the equation 3 8 and the induction hypothesis hence p 1 t d p 1 t i 3 1 2 1 2 1 6 0 2 6 0 1 2 m mp 2 i 3 c 3 n n r we deduce from lemma 3 3 1 that d 0 i 3 z 3 n n r for all p 1 since i 3 is injective then d 0 i 3 b 3 n n r by corollary 3 1 1 hence there is c 2 n n r with p 1 such that d di and i z 2 g g since i 2 is sujective it follows from corollary 3 1 2 that there are c 2 n n r with p 1 such that i ds where s c 1 g g we set sp 1 id p 1 t s and for all p 1 we have sp 1 p t p 1 t ds degrees p 1 hence sp 1 p 1 t i degrees p 1 this deformation satisfies the property p 1 and the sequence of deformations sp s 1 converges in the krull sense to a limit under the form i which is equivalent to then belongs to def 0 a r since i is injective injection we suppose that 1 2 def 0 a r are two deformations of 0 such that their images i 1 i 2 def 0 a r are equivalent under gm a we shall show that there is i grn a such that i 2 i 1 we reason by induction on the integer p n there exists t gm a such that p p t i g r n m and i 1 i 2 this is obvious if p 0 then 1 p id p 1 t degrees p 1 since 14 p i gn a r i 1 i 2 i def 0 a r then the expression 1 p i 1 1 p i 1 id p 1 t i 1 p t i 1 p 1 t i 1 d 0 degrees p 1 1 p i 2 belongs to i def 0 a r from lemma 3 3 we have d 0 i 2 z 2 n n r for all p 1 since i 2 is injective then d 0 i 2 b 2 n n r by corollary 3 1 1 hence there are s c 1 n n r such that d 0 d 0 i 1 s and i 1 s z 1 g g for all p 1 since i 1 is surjective it follows from corollary 3 1 2 that there are 1 adg b 1 g g and 2 c 1 n n r such that i 1 s 1 i 1 2 for all p 1 the derivations 1 being inner it follows that they may be lifted to derivations 1 t of i 1 by lemma 3 4 since exp p 1 t 1 t is an automorphism of i 1 by lemma 3 5 and the induction hypothesis hence we get p 1 p p p 1 t i 1 s 2 termof degrees p 1 then verifies the property for p 1 the sequence p converges in the sense of krull to an automorphism which belongs to i g r n a satisfying i 1 i 2 2 local isomorphism let f b c be a local k algebra morphism and f b c its unique extension on the completion k algebras set a o a 0 from the surjectivity on the classes there are an element h or 0 o a 0 of defr 0 o a 0 and an element s of gm o a 0 such that h s 3 9 by corollary 2 2 and remark 2 2 there is a local morphism h or a 0 o a 0 and s grn o a 0 such that h s h 3 10 since is an epimorphism because is it follows from the equation 3 9 that h is an epimorphism by lemma 3 6 from the equation 3 10 we deduce that h is an epimorphism consequently h o a 0 o a 0 is an epimorphism is an epimorphism since i 2 is injective since o a 0 is the inverse limit of oa 0 m n oa 0 n it follows that the homomorphisms h n o a 0 mn oa 0 oa 0 m n oa 0 induced by h are isomorphisms n 1 2 since h is surjective and oa 0 m n oa 0 is a o a 0 m oa 0 module of finite dimension since oa 0 is noetherian hence h becomes an isomorphism and then is injective then is an isomorphism since is an epimorphism we deduce that is an isomorphism if and only if is by corollary 1 6 p 282 1 since k c 15 proposition 3 1 if a 1 and a 2 are two admissible sets at 0 then the local rings oa 1 0 and o a 2 0 are isomorphic for k c proof since i o 0 o ai 0 is versal for i 1 2 there are two local morphisms 1 o a 2 0 oa 1 0 and 2 o a 1 0 oa 2 0 such that 1 resp 2 is equivalent to 1 2 resp 2 1 it follows from above and since i is surjective that i is sujective for 1 2 the local morphism 1 2 o a 1 0 o a 1 0 and 2 1 o a 2 0 o a 2 0 are surjective as composition of surjective maps since oai 0 is noetherian then 1 2 and 2 1 are bijective by using the same argument as in the proof of theorem 3 1 hence the map i is injective so is bijective for 1 2 we deduce that i is bijective by corollary 1 6 p 282 1 proposition 3 2 an algebraic lie algebra g r n with reductive part r u s where s is the semi simple part and u is the torus part satisfies the hypotheses of theorem 3 1 iff it belongs to one of the following cases 1 u 6 0 g is complete h 1 n g n r 0 h 2 n g n r 2 u 0 h 1 n g n r 0 h 2 n g n r proof with the long sequence of cohomology of 3 1 and the factorization of hochschild serre 11 we can show the statement let n be a lie algebra a derivation of n has a strict positive spectrum denoted by 0 if all its eigenvalues are in q 0 the algebraic lie algebra derk n admits a chevalley s decomposition s a n where s is a levi subalgebra a is an abelian subalgebra such that s a 0 n is the largest ideal of nilpotence and r s a the reductive part proposition 3 3 if there is a derivation of n such 0 then n is nilpotent and we have 1 a is nonzero and contains a derivation with strict positive spectrum 2 any complete lie algebra with nilpotent radical n is given by g 1 r 1 n with r 1 s 1 t 1 r such that s 1 is a semisimple subalgebra of s and t 1 is a maximal torus in der n s 1 ss 1 a ns 1 with nr 1 0 there is a solvable lie algebra of this type t n if nt 0 for a maximal torus t on n the lie algebra g 1 satisfies the hypotheses of the theorem of reduction 3 2 formal rigidity let 0 lm k and a an admissible set at 0 the krull s dimension d of the completion local ring o a 0 of o a 0 for the m oa 0 adic topology is the maximal number of elements t 1 td of m o a 0 such that the subring of formal power series in t 1 td is isomorphic to the formal power series ring k t 1 td in d variables this gives the dimension of lam 0 at point 0 the formal rigidity is the rigidity relative to the base k t if we suppose that there is a valuation on k for example c we can define a separated strong topology on km and use the notion of convergence of series analyticity in this case the formal rigidity is 16 equivalent to the analytic rigidity by m artin s theorem 1 5 this rigidity is also equivalent to the orbit is open in the senses of zariski and strong topology cf 13 we call it the geometric rigidity at point 0 theorem 3 2 for all admissible set a of i at 0 then the following conditions are equivalent 1 dimko a 0 2 the krull s dimension d of o a 0 is null 0 is an isolated point of l 0 a m k 3 the elements of the maximal ideal of oa 0 are nilpotent 4 0 is formally rigid in lm 5 moreover if k is a valued field the orbit 0 is a zariski s open set in lm k proof 1 2 if t is an element of m oa 0 then the sequence t i i n linearly generates a vector subspace of finite dimension consequently the subring k t of o a 0 cannot be a ring of series power so d 0 2 3 if t m oa 0 then the ring k t is isomorphic to the ring k t t p where p n and tp 0 the equivalences 1 3 4 5 are proved in proposition 6 6 8 a formal rigid law in lm is algebraic 3 and admits a chevalley s decomposition g r n corollary 3 2 1 if g r n is such that g n n and h 2 n g n r 0 then g is formal rigid in lm if and only if is n in l r n 2 if g r n is such that g n n and g is formal rigid in lm then n is formal rigid in lrn proof 1 let 0 resp 0 denote the law of g resp n for all admissible set a i resp a i at 0 resp 0 defined as in theorem 3 1 the local morphism oa 0 o r a 0 is an isomorphism since g n n and h 2 n g n r 0 it follows that the dimension of the space oa 0 is finite if and only if it is for or a 0 then we deduce the statement from theorem 3 2 2 is surjective since g n n we deduce the statement from theorem 3 2 corollary 3 3 if gk rk nk satisfies h 1 nk gk nk rk h 2 nk gk nk rk 0 and rk nk nk for k 1 2 then g 1 g 2 is formal rigid if and only if g 1 and g 2 are formal rigid proof if g n and r are the direct products of gk nk and rk respectively we then obtain the same conditions in the statement for g in fact h 2 n g n r is equal to homr h 2 n g n where the second homology group h 2 n is isomorphic to h 2 n 1 h 2 n 2 e with e n 1 n 1 n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 n 2 n 2 we have homr e g n 0 the condition r n n implies that l r n l r 1 n 1 lr 2 n 2 since b 2 n n r b 2 n 1 n 1 r 1 b 2 n 2 n 2 r 2 then a a 1 a 2 is an admissible set at n with ai admissible sets at ni for i 1 2 hence l r a n l r 1 a 1 n 1 lr 2 a 2 n 2 and the local ring o r a n of l r a n at n is isomorphic to o r 1 a 1 n 1 k o r 2 a 2 n 2 with 17 orknk the local ring of l rk nk at nk k 1 2 then the k dimension of o r a n is finite iff it is for o r 1 a 1 n 1 and o r 2 a 2 n 2 we deduce the result from theorem 3 2 and corollary 3 2 4 versality in central extensions we shall construct a sequence of central extensions of schemes ltn n for n n 0 under some hypotheses on the weights of t such that 1 any law n 1 l t n 1 0 is a central extension of a law n l t n 0 where t is a maximal torus of n which is extended to n 1 by adding a weight n 1 2 the construction of a versal deformation of t n in lm is equivalent to that of n in l t n via the reduction theorem 3 a versal deformation of the laws n 1 is deduced from that of n by central extension starting from an initialization n n 0 where the torus t appears 4 1 central extensions of schemes a torus t on kn is defined by the set n of its weights i t t ei i t ei 1 i n t t we denote again by t the torus on k n 1 defined by adding the weight n 1 t t en 1 n 1 t en 1 t t the variety ltn k is the set of lie multiplications defined by ei ej n k 1 k ijek such that k i j t k ij 0 t t i j k this is equivalent to kij 0 for k 6 i j denote by j the set the multi indices k ij such that i j and i j k the coordinates x k ij in l t n are indexed by j and the jacobi s relations are given by jhijk ijk n l 1 x lijx h lk 0 1 i j k n 1 h n 4 1 for i j k h n let n t be the subset of l t n k consisting of laws such that t is exactly a maximal torus of derivations if n t is nonempty then t is algebraic let t be the torus on kn 1 given by n 1 n n 1 we suppose the choice of n 1 such that n 1 t is nonempty the weight of nonzero weightvector of the form ei en 1 for i n is i n 1 n 1 if 0 n and n 1 n n then ei en 1 0 for i n and ken 1 is central this means that any law n 1 l t n 1 k is a central extension of a law n l t n k of kernel ken 1 i e we have the exact sequence of lie algebras 0 ken 1 kn 1 n 1 kn n 4 2 if t is maximal on kn 1 n 1 i e n 1 n 1 t then the extension is not trivial and corresponds to a nonzero class of h 2 n ken 1 t for the trivial action the group of homology h 2 n is a t module decomposed as h 2 n t h 2 n 4 3 thus h 2 n ken 1 t homt h 2 n ken 1 h 2 n n 1 4 4 18 it follows from 4 4 that a nonzero cohomology class corresponds to a nonzero homology class such that the weight n 1 appears in the decomposition 4 3 and implies that n 1 i j for i j n we suppose that n consists of strict positive weights i e there is t t such that each weight i satisfies i t q for 1 i n we deduce the following properties 1 ltn k is formed of nilpotent lie multiplications 2 n 1 is formed of strict positive weights 3 t n where n l t n is complete and satisfies the reduction theorem definition 4 1 a sequence of weights p t is a path of weights if 1 there is n 0 n such that the family 1 n 0 generates t over k and i 0 for all i 1 n 0 2 n t is a nonempty set for all n n 0 3 n 1 does not belong to n n for all n n 0 n 0 is called the initialization of where the torus t is maximal the initialization n 0 of corresponds to the value of n where the torus t is maximal the condition of the central extension will give the existence of a morphism of schemes which generalizes the quotient map 4 2 let pn denote the polynomial ring k xkij k ij j and jn the ideal generated by the jacobi s polynomials jhijk see 4 1 proposition 4 1 if p p n t is a path of weights with n n 0 then 1 the ideal jn 1 is generated by the ideal jn and the polynomials j n 1 ijk where 1 i j k n 2 the canonical monomorphism in pn pn 1 induces a morphism on the quotients pn jn pn 1 jn 1 and a scheme morphism pn 1 l t n 1 ltn defined on the space of rational points l t n 1 k by the quotient map 4 2 proof 1 consider a nontrivial jacobi s polynomial jhijk with h n we will show that it belongs to jn it is clear for k n if k n 1 then i j n 1 n 1 it follows by assumptions that one of the following elements n 1 i n 1 j n 1 i j belongs to n 1 with i j n 1 however if i j n then the elements n 1 i n 1 j and n 1 i j do not belong to n 1 by hypothesis on n 1 if i j n then i j n 1 and its multiplicity is 1 the weight 2 n 1 corresponds to a trivial bracket by similar arguments we show that for i j k the polynomial jn 1 ijk satisfies k n we deduce that jn 1 is generated by jn and the polynomials j n 1 ijk 2 the correspondence xkij x k ij for i j n and k n induces an injective map in pn pn 1 which sends jn to jn 1 it induces a quotient morphism in pn jn pn 1 jn 1 and pn 1 spec in l t n 1 l t n 19 4 2 versality in central extensions the laws of the open set n 1 t are coming from n t in general and it is even possible that there are laws n of n t no having an extension in n 1 t this happens when h 2 n n 1 is zero however an extension n 1 of n n t cf 4 2 belongs to n 1 t iff it is not trivial we will say that n 1 is obtained by a direct filiation of n this means that there are two admissible sets an and an 1 at n and n 1 respectively such that an 1 an n 1 pq for some p q satisfying n 1 n 1 pq 6 0 the inclusion an an 1 thus induces a process of construction by central extension 4 2 such an obtained sequence of schemes is called a direct filiation next we shall develop it the trace p 1 n 1 n l t an 1 n 1 of the fiber of pn 1 l t n 1 l t n of each point n l t an n on l t an 1 n 1 is the set of laws n 1 l t an 1 n 1 which satisfy 4 2 and the condition n 1 n 1 pq 1 as subscheme it is the set of xn 1 ij which verify xn 1 pq 1 4 5 and jacobi s equations ijk l n l ijx n 1 lk 0 4 6 let n be a nilpotent lie algebra with bracket and a a central ideal of dimension one which is stable under a torus t on n let b be a complement of a in n stable under t identified with n a as t module hence may be written as 0 where 0 is the lie bracket defined on n a transferred on b and is a cocycle of z 2 n a a t let n be the t submodule of 3 n generated by the vectors xyz x y z if is the weight of t on a then the group h 2 n a t is isomorphic to homt h 2 n a h 2 n it follows from proposition 3 2 in 4 that h 2 n is isomorphic to ker n proposition 4 2 if t does not have a null weight on n a then the vector space h 2 n is isomorphic to ker 0 ker n a if the class of is nonzero then it is a hyperplan of h 2 n a proof we have b 1 a 1 b 2 a 2 b 1 a 1 b 2 a 2 b 1 b 2 0 b 1 b 2 b 1 b 2 for all b 1 b 2 a 1 a 2 b 2 a 2 it follows that ker ker 0 ker n a 4 7 hence n a 0 since a a 0 and b n a does not admit a null weight by hypothesis by eq 4 7 we have ker ker 0 ker the space n is generated by the cyclic sums of tensors and we have b 1 a 1 b 2 a 2 b 3 a 3 0 b 1 b 2 b 3 0 b 1 b 2 a 3 b 1 b 2 b 3 for all b 1 b 2 b 3 a 1 a 2 a 3 b 3 a 3 according to the hypothesis the last two tensors have a null projection on the weightspace of and hence there are iso morphisms n n a and h 2 n ker 0 ker n a 20 the homomorphism 2 n a a is zero on a complement of 2 n a if it is zero on ker 0 i e on ker 0 then it factorizes through the quotient 2 n a ker 0 hence 2 n a ker 0 and n a n a are isomorphic and may be written as h 0 for some h homk n a n a a thus the class of is zero it follows that if the class of is nonzero then can be identified with a linear form which is nonzero on ker 0 if lt ann 0 n is a direct filiation then the construction of the scheme l t an 1 n 1 is obtained from the scheme lt ann by vanishing the new jacobi s polynomials jn 1 ijk ijk l y lijx n 1 lk 1 j k n 4 8 and the polynomial xn 1 pq 1 4 9 where the variables y y lij 1 j n l n are the ancient coordinates and xn 1 lk l k n are the new we can summary this study showing the different cases of the discussion of the extension n n 1 if on on y is the local ring of lt ann at n then the local ring on 1 on 1 x y of l t an 1 n 1 at n 1 is obtained by localizing the quotient ring a on xn 1 ij j by the maximal ideal generated by the classes of representatives f x y which vanish at n 1 where j is the ideal generated by the polynomials 4 8 and 4 9 we obtain the following theorem with n dimh 2 n n 1 theorem 4 1 let lt ann 0 n be a direct filiation each point n 1 of the fiber of n in l t an 1 n 1 k verifies one of the following cases 1 if n 0 then the fiber does not exist 2 if n 1 then n 1 is unique in the fiber and on 1 is a quotient of on moreover if n is rigid then n 1 is rigid 3 if n 1 then on 1 is the localization ring at 0 0 of the quotient of on t 1 t n 1 by the ideal generated by polynomials in y of the form c 0 y 0 k n c k y tk 1 c l y m on 0 l n indexed over the triples i j k satisfying i j k n 1 the krull s dimension d of the scheme l t an 1 n 1 at n 1 is minored by n 1 in particular n 1 is not rigid proof the case n 0 is trivial if n 0 the jacobi s polynomials indexed by the set of triples i j k with i j k n 1 and the condition xn 1 pq 1 may be written as a 0 y 6 p q a y x where runs through the set m of couples i j such that i j n 1 i j 6 p q and a 0 a on let a be the system obtained by vanishing these polynomials if we fix y to n the equation system a becomes a equation system b where the solutions in x are formed of z 2 n ken 1 t such that n 1 pq 1 it gives an affine space of dimension n 1 see proposition 4 2 let 1 be a subset of such that the equation subsystem of b indexed by 1 is equivalent to b 21 and 1 is minimal for this property there is a subset m 1 m of cardinal 1 such that the submatrix a n 1 m 1 is invertible this matrix remains invertible if we take its values in on since its projection by pr on on m on is it follows that the equation subsystem of a indexed by 1 permits to express the variables x m 1 in function of variables x m m 1 i e x a 0 y a y x m 1 where a 0 y a y on we substitute these expressions in the remaining expressions of a for multi indices 1 which gives the new system of equations by vanishing the following expressions b 0 y m m 1 b y x 1 4 10 if we fix y to n then the equation system 4 10 corresponds to the system of equations b indexed by 1 theses equations give anything more on k and are identically null i e b 0 y b y 0 for 1 and m m 1 in other words the elements b 0 y and b y belong to the maximal ideal of on the ring a is equal to the quotient of on x m m 1 by the ideal generated by the terms 4 10 if we localize this ring at point n 1 we will take new adapted variables x n 1 which we write tk with indexation k on 1 n 1 then the jacobi s polynomials are written as c 0 y 0 k n c k y tk 1 with c l y m on 0 l n and a is written as in 3 we localize at point n 1 by considering the maximal ideal obtained as quotient of the maximal ideal of on t is m on t 1 k n tk on t if n 1 we see that the ring a is equal to the quotient of on by the ideal generated by the b 0 1 we obtain the result if n 1 there are n 1 new parameters which are algebraically independent over k then the krull s dimension satisfies d n 1 4 3 continuous families of lie algebras definition 4 2 a path of weights is said to be simple if all weights are distinct with this definition the coordinates xkij may be indexed by the weights them selves one can write xij instead of x k ij since the index k is fixed by the weight i j the set of pairs i j such that i j n shall be denoted again by j set gn gln k t 0 proposition 4 3 let t be a torus on kn one supposes that its set of weights n is a simple path of weights then n t is a zariski s open set equal to the set of elements n l t n such that t n is complete it is the union of the gn orbits of maximal dimension n dimk t proof if is an element of ltn k then der t is a torus containing t then the law satisfies t n n n n and nt z n 0 and then is a complete lie algebra cf 7 then the set n t consists of elements such that t i e dim dimt since t it follows that it is the zariski s open set union of orbits of maximal dimension remark 4 1 under the above hypotheses any element ltn belongs to the zariski s open n of the subscheme l n of l t n in which we can apply the reduction theorem for the different n form a stratification of l t n 22 the open stratum n t gives a quotient variety n t gn under gn proposition 4 4 the isomorphic classes in n t are the orbits of the nor malizer group h of t in gln k under the canonical action proof we can see that h stabilizes ltn k and n t conversely if 1 and 2 are isomorphic then there is s gln k such that s 1 is equal to 2 with maximal torus s t s 1 the field k being algebraically closed there is an automorphism s of 2 which conjugates s t s 1 and t according to a mostow s theorem we have s s h proposition 4 5 the isomorphic classes in the quotient n t gn are the orbits of the finite group h h 0 with h the normalizer group of t in gln k and h 0 its identity component this variety is called continuous family associated with the maximal torus t proof it is a direct consequence of proposition 4 4 next we will study the quotient variety n t gn with the help of slices l t a n 0 0 n t which are local affine charts the weights being distinct then gn is the diagonal group identified with k n the canonical action of an element s s 1 sn of gn on x is defined by s x k ij sk sisj xkij where x is a law defined by its coordinates x ei ej kx k ijek it is particularly easy to characterize an admissible set of j at a law it is just a subset a of j such that the following system of equations kij sk sisj kij for i j a 4 11 is equivalent to the system s and is minimal for this property the minimality of a implies that kij 6 0 for all i j a it follows that a is contained in the set j consisting of pairs i j such that k ij 6 0 proposition 4 6 a subset a of j is admissible at if and only if a is a minimal subset of j such that the system sk sisj i j a defines the subgroup aut t 0 of gn the laws of ltn k which have the same subset j j thus have the same admissible sets a j the same group aut t 0 and the same maximal torus two equivalent laws under gn have the same subset j of j since eq 4 11 implies that a nonzero coordinate remains nonzero under gn theorem 4 2 under the hypothesis of a simple path of weights each law n t admits an admissible set a of cardinal a n dimk t we have for such a subset a 1 admits a as admissible set iff kij 6 0 for all k ij a where i j 2 all laws of lt an 0 k admit a as admissible set 3 lt an 0 k is contained in n t and its isomorphic classes are the traces of the orbits 23 4 admits a as admissible set iff there is an element s gn such that s lt an 0 k 5 h 2 0 0 t is the zariski s tangent space to lt an 0 k at 0 proof the laws which admit a as admissible set satisfy 6 0 for all a this condition is sufficient if the cardinal of

terms sk sisj are free and can take arbitrary non null values there thus exits in the orbit of 0 a representative for any arbitrary choice of non null components a if a is maximal we obtain 4 and 5 results from transversal property of the slice consequence let a be the set of the laws admitting a as admissible set then a is an open set and n t a a the slices associated with a same a are isomorphic and identified with the quotient a gn varying the admissible parts a the slices are affine local charts of n t gn giving continuous families in theorem 4 2 3 convention from theorem 4 2 4 we may fix arbitrary values of the com ponents a of a law in n t one adopts the convention x k ij 1 for all kij a the corresponding subscheme denoted by l t a n is isomorphic to lt an 0 5 examples all examples considered in this section satisfy the hypothesis of proposition 3 3 then the calculation of versal deformations of m t n in lm can be deduced from those of n in l t n also versal deformations of n l t n are calculated from that of n 0 l t n 0 by successive central extensions with n 0 the dimension where the maximal torus t appears 5 1 first example let fn be a lie defined by 0

w 12 we have o t a 12 f 12 k u u 5 with a nilpotent element t u of order 5 and o t a 12 w 12 k it follows from theorem 3 2 that f 12 and w 12 are formal rigid in l t 12 now we reason by induction on n for n 1 13 we separately study the central extensions of fn and of wn proceeding by induction let yij denote the ancient structure constants for i j n and xij the new variables for i j n 1 the relations j 1 jn j xj 1 n j yj n j xj n 1 j 0 give xj n 1 j j k j 1 k jyk n k 1 j j 1 xj 1 n j 5 12 and it suffices to write another relation for fixing xij in function of the yij in particular the relation j 24 n 5 0 fixes x 6 n 5 for wn we obtain only the witt lie algebra wn 1 and there are not new parameters the others jacobi s relations are automatically satisfied for fn the relation 5 12 and j 24 n 5 0 fix the structure constants at neigh bourhood of fn 1 which verify the given relations in the theorem hence there are not new parameter we must verify that the remained jacobi s relations do not reduce the order of nilpotency of the parameter t it is obvious to see that the jacobi s polynomials jijk i j k are vanished for j 6 and it remains to see that jijk for 2 i j 5 are null too corollary 5 1 1 the slice lt ann 0 associated with an is isomorphic to spec k u u 5 10 u 1 for n 12 where u 1 10 resp u 0 corresponds to the witt lie algebra wn resp fn 2 the versal deformation of wn associated with an is constant o t an wn k remark 5 1 the lie algebra fn is formal t rigid if n 5 6 and n 12 and no formal t rigid for 9 n 11 if we develop their versal deformations on the competion local ring they will become gerstenhaber s deformations 26 5 2 second example let t be a torus defined by the set of its weights i 1 i 4 i j i j 6 1 4 i j k i j k 6 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 the coordinates xkij of the scheme l t n may be indexed by the weights them selves one writes x instead of x k ij since the index k is fixed by the weight the jacobi s polynomials are j x x x x x x 5 13 for and we consider successive central extensions by the sums of 2 3 and 4 weights and a is an admissible set the law defined by the i for 1 i 4 is abelian and provides the initialization n 0 4 central extension by the sums of 2 weights each i j with i j 6 1 4 is associated to the coordinate x i j without jacobi s relation set a 2 i j i j 6 1 4 and fix x 1 a 2 5 14 central extensions by the sums of 3 weights the weight 1 3 4 gives coordinates x 1 3 4 and x 4 1 3 since i j 6 14 and the jacobi s polynomial j 1 3 4 imposes x 4 1 3 x 1 3 4 in the same fash ion 1 2 4 gives x 1 2 4 and x 4 1 2 and j 1 2 4 implies that x 4 1 2 x 1 2 4 for 1 2 3 we have x 1 2 3 x 2 1 3 and x 3 1 2 and j 1 2 3 gives x 2 1 3 x 1 2 3 x 3 1 2 set a 3 a 2 4 1 3 4 1 2 3 1 2 and fix x 1 for all a 3 a 2 we have x 4 1 3 x 1 3 4 x 4 1 2 x 1 2 4 x 3 1 2 1 5 15 x 2 1 3 x 1 2 3 1 5 16 central extensions by the sums of 4 weights givesx 2 1 3 4 x 3 1 2 4 x 4 1 2 3 x 1 2 3 4 and x 1 3 2 4 set a 4 a 3 2 1 3 4 and fix x 2 1 3 4 1 the jacobi s relations j i j i j for i j 6 2 3 give the following equations x 1 2 3 4 x 2 1 3 4 1 x 1 3 2 4 x 3 1 2 4 5 17 x 1 3 2 4 x 4 1 2 3 1 5 18 x 1 2 3 x 4 1 2 3 0 5 19 with the choice of a a 4 we obtain two essentials parameters u x 1 2 3 and v x 4 1 2 3 verifying 5 19 and we can state with 0 l t a 13 theorem 5 2 the slice l t a 13 is isomorphic to spec k u v uv 1 if 0 1 2 3 0 4 1 2 3 0 then 0 is a singular point at the intersection of two components of the slice and 0 u 1 v 2 with uv 0 is a versal deformation of 0 where 1 and 2 are two cocycles with non null classes the local ring ot a 0 is the localization of k u v uv at the maximal ideal p consisting of p such that p 0 0 0 denoted by k u v uv p 27 2 if 0 1 2 3 6 0 resp 0 4 1 2 3 6 0 then 0 is a regular point at the one component of the slice and 0 u 1 resp 0 v 2 is a versal deformation of 0 where 1 and 2 are two cocycles with non null classes the local ring ot a 0 is equal to k u v uv p where the maximal ideal p consists of p such that p u 0 0 0 resp p 0 v 0 0 and is isomorphic to k remark 5 2 we deduce from the reduction theorem that a 0 u 1 v 2 is a versal deformation of 0 t 0 in case 1 and 0 u 1 or 0 v 2 in case 2 b the 2 cohomology group of 0 is c 2 in the case 1 and c in the case 2 5 3 conclusion gerstenhaber nijenhuis and richardson did not study versal deformations in their work however they studied obstruction problems of one parameter defor mations and proved the link between rigidity of an algebra and its cohomology to choose the local ring o as base is natural and provides the canonical deformation id o o which is a universal object in the category of de formations at 0 satisfying the property i of definition 2 1 however this deformation is not minimal for this property this is why we define a slice of lm containing the point 0 such that its canonical deformation in this subscheme is minimal and called versal the methods for computing versal deformations by fixing parameters and central extensions and the reduction s theorem presented above simplify a lot of their calculations we can deduce all the deformation equivalence classes of 0 with base a r from its versal deformation associated with an admissible set a given by the local ring ot a 0 of the slice at 0 each deformation with base a is equivalent to h where the change base h o t a 0 a is defined by its image h o t a 0 which corresponds to a quotient o t a 0 i of o t a 0 with i an ideal to classify all deformation equivalence classes of 0 with base a is equivalent to classify all ideals of i such that the local ring o t a 0 i is isomorphic to a local subring of a in the case where a k corresponds to the formal deformations in the gerstenhaber s sense of 0 since k is a domain then the ideals i will be considered prime in the first example the point 0 is regular for 7 n 11 and the com pletion of the local ring ot an 0 k t t is k t then the versal deformation of 0 can be written as n t n n on the completion ring and gives one formal deformation of 0 up an equivalence for n 12 the krull s dimension of the completion of the local ring ot an 0 k u u 5 is null then 0 is formal rigid cf theorem 3 2 and any formal deformation of 0 is trivial in the second example the point 0 at the intersection of two lines admits a versal deformation 0 u 1 v 2 the completion of the local ring o t a 0 k u v uv p is k u v uv let u resp v be denote the class of u resp v in o t a 0 it is clear that the ideals i 1 u and i 2 v are prime the krull s dimension of o t a 0 being one we have only three prime ideals i 1 i 2 and 28 p where p is the maximal ideal consisting of p o t a 0 such that p 0 0 0 this gives three formal deformations i 0 i i for h i o t a 0 o t a 0 ii k i for 1 2 and 0 for h o t a 0 o t a 0 p k the deformations 1 and 2 are not equivalent because 1 and 2 are linearly independent in h 2 n n t consequently there are two nontrivial formal deformations 1 and 2 of 0 up an equivalence
