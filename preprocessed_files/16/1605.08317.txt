friend abstract let e be a directed graph k any field and let lk e denote the leavitt path algebra of e with coefficients in k we show that lk e is a be zout ring i e that every finitely generated one sided ideal of lk e is principal given any directed graph e and field k one may construct the leavitt path algebra of e with coefficients in k denoted lk e as first described in 4 and 8 since the introduction of the topic in 2005 leavitt path algebras have been the object of broad and deep investi gation not only among algebraists but in the analysis and symbolic dynamics communities as well the synergy within this at first seemingly disparate group of researchers has led to a number of important advances in each of these disciplines for a general overview of the topic including a description of these wide ranging connections see e g 1 over the past decade various structural properties of the algebras lk e have been dis covered with many of the results in the subject taking on the following form lk e has some specified algebraic property if and only if e has some specified graph theoretic property the structure of the field k often plays no role in results of this type a few of many examples of such results include a description of those leavitt path algebras which are sim ple purely infinite simple finite dimensional prime primitive etc a significant majority of these results can be interpreted as statements about the two sided ideal structure of lk e indeed it has only been quite recently that the subject of the one sided structure and more generally the module theoretic structure of these algebras has been broached see e g 9 herein we continue this line of investigation by establishing a perhaps surprising result about the structure of the finitely generated one sided ideals of a leavitt path algebra as follows an ideal i of a ring r is called principal if it is generated by a single element i e if i rt for some t i the well studied notion of a principal ideal domain a commutative integral domain in which every ideal is principal appears throughout the mathematical literature the standard nontrivial example of such is the algebra of polynomials k x over a field k more generally a principal ideal ring is a not necessarily commutative not necessarily zero divisor free ring in which every one sided ideal is principal these too have been well studied with an overview appearing in 17 chapter 3 and foundational results appearing in e g 7 10 and 14 key words and phrases leavitt path algebra be zout ring 2010 ams subject

the notion of a principal ideal ring can be extended to include only those one sided ideals which admit the possibility of being principal definition a ring r is called left be zout in case every finitely generated left ideal of r is principal r is called be zout in case every finitely generated one sided left and right ideal of r is principal as with their more classical forebears be zout rings have been investigated in a number of settings for instance kaplansky considered be zout rings in 16 4 as part of his investigation of triangular reduction of matrices various additional properties of be zout rings have been considered as well in 11 12 19 and 20 there are a number of ring theoretic properties which r lk e possesses for any graph e these include r is hereditary every one sided ideal is projective r is semiprimitive zero jacobson radical and r is ring isomorphic to its opposite ring rop the main result of this article is theorem 15 and its generalization corollary 16 in which we add another property to this list theorem for any graph e and field k the leavitt path algebra lk e is be zout we note that a key role in establishing this theorem will be played by a construction motivated directly by a result coming from symbolic dynamics theorem 14 until the closing remarks of this article we will focus solely on establishing this result for finite graphs that the result holds for all graphs will then follow as an easy consequence of a general result about leavitt path algebras we set some notation a directed graph e e 0 e 1 s r consists of a vertex set e 0 an edge set e 1 and source and range functions s r e 1 e 0 for v e 0 the set of edges e e 1 s e v is denoted by s 1 v and the set of edges e e 1 r e v by r 1 v e is called finite in case both e 0 and e 1 are finite sets a vertex v is a source vertex or simply a source in case r 1 v i e in case v is not the range vertex of any edge in e a path in e is a sequence e 1 e 2 en of edges in e for which r ei s ei 1 for all 1 i n 1 we say that such has length n and we write s s e 1 and r r en we view each vertex v e 0 as a path of length 0 and denote v s v r v a path c e 1 e 2 en in e is a cycle in case r en s e 1 and there are no repeated vertices in the set c 0 s e 1 s e 2 s en a subset w of e 0 is called hereditary in case whenever w w and v e 0 and there is a path for which s w and r v then v w we say that w is saturated if whenever s 1 v 6 and r e s e v w then v w we give here a basic description of lk e for additional information see 3 let k be a field and let e e 0 e 1 s r be a directed graph with vertex set e 0 and edge set e 1 the leavitt path k algebra lk e of e with coefficients in k is the k algebra generated by a set v v e 0 together with a set of symbols e e e e 1 which satisfy the following relations v vu v uv for all v u e 0 e 1 s e e er e e for all e e 1 e 2 r e e e s e e for all e e 1 ck 1 e e e e r e for all e e e 1 and ck 2 v e e 1 s e v ee for every v e 0 for which 0 s 1 v leavitt path algebras are be zout 3 an alternate description of lk e may be given as follows for any graph e let e denote the double graph of e gotten by adding to e an edge e in a reversed direction for each edge e e 1 then lk e is the usual path k algebra ke modulo the ideal generated by the relations ck 1 and ck 2 it is easy to show that lk e is unital if and only if e 0 is finite in this case 1 lk e v e 0 v every element of lk e may be written as n i 1 ki i i where ki is a nonzero element of k and each of the i and i are paths in e with r i r i if path e then we may view lk e and will often refer to such as a real path in lk e analogously for e 1 e 2 en path e we often refer to the element e n e 2 e 1 of lk e as a ghost path in lk e the map ke lk e given by the k linear extension of 7 for path e is an injection of k algebras by 3 corollary 1 5 12 since for a leavitt path algebra we have lk e lk e op the properties left be zout and right be zout are equivalent in this context so we will simply say that lk e is be zout in either case we will use the language of left modules throughout remark 1 in making conjectures about structural properties of leavitt path algebras one always first tests those conjectures against the three primary colors of algebras which arise as such the n n matrix rings mn k the laurent polynomial ring k x x 1 and the classical leavitt algebras lk 1 n a matrix ring mn k is well known to be be zout in fact to be a principal ideal ring this is true as well for the principal ideal domain k x x 1 and for the principal ideal ring mn k x x 1 for a proof that mn k x x 1 is a principal ideal ring see for instance 17 theorem 40 intuitively these are well behaved examples the somewhat exotic nature of lk 1 n provides the reason that it too is be zout specifically let i be a finitely generated left ideal of r lk 1 n since any leavitt path algebra is hereditary i is finitely generated projective so i is isomorphic to a direct summand of rm for some m 1 but r has r rm as left r modules for any m 1 so that i is a direct summand of r and thus principal note that unlike the well behaved cases mn k and k x x 1 r lk 1 n in fact has the stronger property that every finitely generated left r module is principal on the other hand lk 1 n is not a principal ideal ring for instance it is not hard to construct left ideals of lk 1 n which are direct sums of infinitely many nonzero ideals see proposition 17 below a fourth primary color of leavitt path algebras is often added to the aforementioned three namely the jacobson algebra k x y xy 1 which arises as the leavitt path algebra lk t of the toeplitz graph t 99 the jacobson algebra was shown to be be zout by gerritzen 13 with these four classes of leavitt path algebras having been shown to be be zout the conjecture and subsequent establishment of theorem 15 followed plausibly notation a cycle c in a directed graph e is called a source cycle in case r 1 v 1 for every v c 0 in other words c is a source cycle if the vertices in c 0 receive no edges other than those which are already in the cycle c a subset v of e is called a source if either v v where v is a source vertex in e or v is the set of the vertices c 0 of a source cycle c in e in case e is finite we denote by w the set of vertices e 0 v the sum v v v the sum w w w 4 gene abrams francesca mantese and alberto tonolo note that 1 lk e remark 2 source cycles and source vertices share a number of properties but differ in many ways as well in our first few results we will be able to treat these two types of configurations simultaneously but further on we will need to distinguish them one from the other from now on if not differently specified by e we denote a finite graph by v e a source and by w the set of vertices e v by the source elimination graph e v we mean the subgraph of e from which we have eliminated all of the vertices in v and all of the edges having source vertices in v we denote this graph by ew and view it as the restriction subgraph of e to w we note that w is a hereditary subset of e 0 because v is a source lemma 3 let v be a source in e then lk e lk ew more generally let u be any hereditary subset of e 0 and let u u u then lk e lk eu proof in a nonzero expression of the form lk e we must have s w and r s w but then all of the vertices appearing in and are in w as v is a source and hence w is hereditary the general statement follows similarly notation we denote by j the two sided ideal of lk e generated by that is j lk e lk e w w w if v v is a non isolated source vertex then j lk e this follows from the ck 2 relation v e s 1 v ee and each ee e r e e is in j because r e w in case v is isolated or v is a source cycle we get j 6 lk e we denote by v the set of edges of e having source vertex in v and range vertex in w v e e 1 s e v r e w because each element of v is an edge we get that f i fj 0 for fi 6 fj v if v is the set of vertices of a source cycle we fix a starting vertex v 1 so that the source cycle will be denoted by c e 1 e 2 en with s ei vi and r ei vi 1 for 1 i n 1 and r en s v 1 in such a case we denote by v the countable set of all paths which have both s v and r v if v is a source vertex we define v v if p is a path in e with s p v and r p w then p may be completely and uniquely described as p where v v and is a path in ew we state this more formally and thereby obtain a useful description of the elements of lk e lemma 4 any x lk e can be written as x j jfj xj where j v fj v and xj lk e leavitt path algebras are be zout 5 proof this follows since any element x lk e can be written as j j j where the j s are real paths such that s j v and r j r j since r j s j w and w is hereditary then r j r j w so we can describe the j s using the previous discussion we note that we can assume jfj 6 f for j 6 and that any coefficients in k have been absorbed in the xj expressions lemma 5 consider two paths 1 f 1 and 2 f 2 with i v fi v and assume 1 f 1 6 2 f 2 then f 1 1 2 f 2 0 proof indeed if 1 f 1 6 2 f 2 and 1 2 then f 1 6 f 2 and hence f 1 1 2 f 2 f 1 f 2 0 on the other hand assume 1 6 2 if 1 2 6 0 then either 1 2 or 2 1 in the first case we get 1 2 f 2 f 2 0 while in the second case f 1 1 2 f 1 0 lemma 6 if is any path in e and r lk e then 1 is an idempotent in r 2 and 3 r r as left ideals of r 4 r rw as left r modules where w r more generally if y r then ry ryw proof 1 are 2 and trivial 3 follows from 2 the isomorphism in 4 is established by considering the two morphisms ryw ry via ryw 7 ryw and ry ryw via ry 7 ry ryw a description of the two sided ideal j as a left ideal will be central to the discussion lemma 7 as a left ideal of r lk e j r f v rf proof we know that j w w v r r as a two sided ideal since r r r and r j we have j r r j let m r j since m j then m i i i i since s i w and w is hereditary also r i s i r i belongs to w since m r then r i s i v by lemma 4 we have i ifi xi x i f i i so m belongs to i rf i i i r ifif i i where each r ifif i i is a direct summand of rr since its generator ifif i i is an idempotent by lemma 6 moreover by lemma 5 ifif i i is orthogonal to jfjf j j unless fi fj and i j this establishes that j is contained in the displayed direct sum the reverse containment is clear since f f for any f v as r f w by definition we note that it is possible for the summand f v rf which appears in the previous result to be zero this happens in case v is isolated in which case v is empty the general program here is to establish that lk e is be zout by showing that the be zout property passes from various factor rings and subalgebras of lk e back to lk e first of 6 gene abrams francesca mantese and alberto tonolo all we record a useful observation which will facilitate passing the be zout property to a ring from its subrings lemma 8 let r be any ring and let x 1 x 2 xn r let s be a unital subring of r if r is unital we do not require that 1 r 1 s suppose x 1 x 2 xn s and suppose the left s ideal sx 1 sx 2 sxn is principal i e suppose there exists x s for which sx 1 sx 2 sxn sx then rx 1 rx 2 rxn rx in particular if every finite subset of r is contained in a unital be zout subring of r then r is be zout proof since 1 sxi xi for all 1 i n we have in particular that each xi is in sx 1 sx 2 sxn so we get that for each i there exists si s with xi six but then rx 1 rx 2 rxn rs 1 x rs 2 x rsnx rx the reverse containment follows as well x 1 sx sx so x sx 1 sx 2 sxn rx 1 rx 2 rxn proposition 9 let i be a finitely generated left ideal of r lk e with i r suppose r is be zout then i ry for some y r moreover there exists a split epimorphism r i 0 proof write i rr 1 rrm for r 1 rm r for each 1 i m use lemma 4 to write ri ri ri ri j jfj r i j ri for some r i j r let s r and consider the finitely generated left s ideal i s ri i j s rij by the be zout hypothesis on s there exists y s such that i s ri i j s rij sy so by lemma 8 i r ri i j r rij ry and hence i ry conversely ri i and ri i since ri i and r i j f j j ri this follows since if j 6 k then jfj 6 kfk and so f j j kfk 0 so r i j i since y i r ri i j r rij we get ry i summarizing we have shown that if i is a finitely generated left ideal of r which is contained in r then i ry for some y r s since r lk e is hereditary necessarily ry is projective so the epimorphism r ry 0 sending 1 7 y splits notice that since y 0 we get that r 0 and so we have a split epimorphism r ry 0 lemma 10 let r denote lk e and let v be a source in e suppose r is be zout let b r be a finitely generated left ideal where is a real path with w r w then b is principal indeed b ry for some y r proof by lemma 6 4 we have that the map r rw given by right multiplication by is an isomorphism of left r modules so that b is a finitely generated submodule of rw but rw r so b is isomorphic to a left ideal of r contained in r so proposition 9 applies to b to yield b ry for some y r then b ry ry but b b because b r we now establish a result similar in flavor to proposition 9 but for ideals contained in the other type of summands of j notation let e be a graph and v e 0 the tree of v denoted t v is the smallest hereditary subset of e 0 containing v formally t v u e 0 there exists a path p in e having s p v and r p u leavitt path algebras are be zout 7 proposition 11 let r denote lk e and let v be a source in e let b r where is a real path with r w set w t r and define u w u suppose r and r are be zout then b is isomorphic to a direct summand of r indeed there is a split epimorphism r b 0 proof by lemma 10 we have b ry for some y r since w without loss of generality we may assume y r we define so that w w w thus y y y and ry r y r y since y y and y y y ry since the set w is hereditary any element of the form w rw w rw must be a sum of elements of the form k where k k and necessarily is a path starting inw and ending in w specifically no summand of w rw can start with a ghost path so in particular we can write y 1 y 1 y where the i are distinct each i igi for some real path possibly a vertex i and edge gi for which s i w r i s gi w and r gi w so the displayed equation gives that r y r y 1 r y for any two paths 1 2 in e the expression 1 2 is nonzero only when 1 is an initial subpath of 2 or 2 is an initial subpath of 1 but because each i has its final edge having source inw and range inw the only way that some i can be an initial subpath of some j is for i j thus i j 0 for i 6 j using this and multiplying the displayed equation on the left by i yields i y yi thus we get thatr y 1 r y r y hence r y 1 r y r y but then ry r y r y r y r y 1 r y so we conclude that z y yi 1 i is a set of generators for ry contained in r but r is be zout by assumption so by lemma 8 we get that ry rx for some x r in particular the map r rx b given by r 7 r x rx is an epimorphism since b is a left ideal of r it is necessarily projective the result follows the exotically behaved algebra lk 1 n for n 2 provides a model for the behavior of a large class of algebras each of which will be easily shown to be be zout definition 12 a ring r is said to have the unbounded generating number property more efficiently ugn in case for each pair of positive integers m n the existence of an epimor phism of left r modules rm rn 0 implies m n lemma 13 suppose r is a ring for which there is a left r module epimorphism r r 2 in other words suppose r fails the ugn property for the pair m 1 n 2 then r is be zout 8 gene abrams francesca mantese and alberto tonolo proof easily the given condition implies that there is a left r module epimorphism r rn for every positive integer n if i is a finitely generated left ideal of r then there exists an epimorphism rn i and so there exists an epimorphism r i so that i is principal we note that for any ring r satisfying the hypotheses of lemma 13 we may indeed conclude that every finitely generated left r module is principal let e be any graph and v e 0 a non sink we consider the nonempty set s 1 v i e the set of edges emitted by v for any nontrivial partition p of s 1 v one may define the out split graph of e at v relative to p denoted by ev p this definition is a specific case of a more general construction although the general construction does not concern us here we will utilize this one specific case of it in particular suppose v is a source vertex for which s 1 v f 1 fn for some n 2 let p be the partition f 1 fn 1 fn of s 1 v then ev p may be described in words as the graph whose vertex set otherwise looks exactly like e 0 but with one additional vertex v added and whose edge set otherwise looks exactly like e 1 except with fn eliminated and with a new edge g added for which s g v and r g r fn even less formally we build ev p by giving the edge fn its own new source vertex and leaving everything else alone for additional information about the out split process see e g 2 we will denote ev p by in the sequel to distinguish between the two related graphs e and we denote by v 0 the vertex v when viewed in 0 theorem 14 2 theorem 2 8 in the situation described above there is an isomorphism of k algebras lk e lk ev p we are now in position to prove our main result theorem 15 let e be a finite graph and k any field then lk e is be zout proof we proceed by induction on e 0 the number of vertices in e if e 0 1 then there are three possibilities either e has no edges exactly one edge or m 2 edges the leavitt path algebras of such graphs are then respectively k k x x 1 and lk 1 m but as established in the introduction each of these k algebras is be zout thus establishing the base case so we assume that e 0 n and that lk f is be zout for any graph f having fewer than n vertices we show that lk e is be zout as in the e 0 1 case there are three possibilities to analyze case 1 e contains neither source vertices nor source cycles by 6 theorem 3 9 lk e does not have unbounded generating number by 6 remark 3 10 the failure of ugn for a leavitt path algebra implies that there is an epimorphism of left lk e modules lk e lk e 2 so by lemma 13 lk e is be zout thus establishing case 1 case 2 e contains a source vertex let v denote a source vertex in e if v is also a sink i e if v is an isolated vertex then it is easy to establish that lk e is isomorphic as k algebras to the ring direct sum leavitt path algebras are be zout 9 k lk e v clearlyk is be zout and lk e v is be zout by the induction hypothesis so that lk e is a direct sum of be zout rings and hence is be zout we now consider the case where s 1 v 1 i e that v emits a single edge which we denote by f we will subsequently analyze the general case let w denote r f so let i lk e be a finitely generated left ideal then i lk e rv r note that rv rf using s 1 v f which yields ff v by the ck 2 relation and using f ff f this yields in particular that rv rw by lemma 6 4 then projecting i into rf along r gives that i i r is isomorphic to a finitely generated submodule of rf rv so that i i r is isomorphic to a left ideal of r contained in rf we denote this left ideal of r by b as r is hereditary this gives in particular that i i r is projective now consider the exact sequence 0 i r i i i r 0 since i i r is projective the sequence splits and we have i i r i i r i r b let w denote t w and the sum over all vertices in w by the induction hypothesis r and r are be zout so b satisfies the conditions of proposition 11 which allows us to write b ryf for some y r so we have i i r ryf since wf f we have ryf rywf so we may assume without loss that yw y as well since y r we have vy 0 by lemma 6 4 ryf ryw ry now we analyze the summand i r since i is finitely generated and i r is a direct summand of i then i r is finitely generated as well since we also have i r r and r is be zout by the induction hypothesis proposition 9 applies to n i r to yield that n is isomorphic to a direct summand of r we write w w w and let w then r rw r so we have i n ryf n ry which is isomorphic to a direct summand of rw r ry now consider the left ideal r ry this is a subideal of r since y yw let s denote r we have y yw s and s note that sy s 0 so that sy s is a finitely generated left ideal of s but s is be zout by the induction hypothesis so sy s sx for some x s then lemma 8 yields that ry r rx but rx r so by proposition 9 rx is isomorphic to a direct summand of r so that ry r is isomorphic to a direct summand of r so by the previous display i is isomorphic to a direct summand of rw r ry which is then isomorphic to a direct summand of rw r which as noted previously is isomorphic to rv r which is precisely r itself so i is isomorphic to a direct summand of r and hence is principal so we have shown if e has the property that lk f is be zout for any graph f having fewer vertices than e and e contains a source vertex v for which s 1 v 1 then lk e is be zout we now consider the general case in which we assume that e has the property that lk f is be zout for any graph f having fewer vertices than e and e contains a source vertex v for which s 1 v m for some positive integer m we seek to show that lk e is be zout 10 gene abrams francesca mantese and alberto tonolo we proceed by induction on m the m 1 case is precisely the case treated in the previous discussion so we assume that if g is any graph which has the property that lk f is be zout for any graph f having fewer vertices than g and g contains a source vertex v for which s 1 v m 1 then lk g is be zout we show that the result passes to the graph e we denote the set s 1 v by f 1 fm 1 fm we construct the out split graph ev p for the partition p f 1 fm 1 fm of s 1 v so using the description given prior to theorem 14 the vertex v 0 of is a source vertex with s 1 v 0 m 1 moreover the new vertex v of is a source vertex with s 1 v 1 we write s 1 v g note that 0 e 0 1 using the isomorphism provided by theorem 14 it suffices to show that lk is be zout we define the graph to be the graph with the vertex v and edge g eliminated so 0 e 0 and s 1 v 0 m then satisfies the appropriate criteria given in the previous two paragraphs so we conclude that lk is be zout so is a graph which contains a source vertex v which emits a single edge g we re examine the proof of the n 1 case above but replacing v and f by the pair v and g we note that t v t v and t r f t r g so that at the point in the previous proof where we construct we may still in the new proof conclude that lk is be zout since w w e 0 on the other hand at the point in the previous proof where we use that lk e is be zout by the induction hypothesis we now have that lk lk is be zout by the argument in the previous paragraph so proceeding as in the n 1 case we conclude that lk lk e is be zout as desired case 3 e contains a source cycle the third and final case in the induction involves an analysis of the situation in which e contains a source cycle recall that we have denoted the cycle by c and the set of vertices c 0 by v and the set of vertices e 0 v by w as in case 2 if c is an isolated cycle then lk e is isomorphic as k algebra to the ring direct sum lk ev lk ew the ring lk ev is be zout since it is isomorphic to mn k x x 1 with n the length of the cycle see remark 1 together with 3 lemma 2 7 1 and lk ew is be zout by the induction hypothesis so lk e is be zout if c is not isolated then the two sided ideal w of lk e is denoted by j by lemma 7 j r f v v rf since c is a cycle the set v is infinite for instance it contains cn for each n n we will use a two step process to show that lk e is be zout in this situation as well first we establish that any finitely generated left ideal i of lk e which is contained in j is principal we then parlay this first step result to show that every finitely generated left ideal of lk e is indeed principal for any n 0 we define n v v to be the finite subset of v consisting of those paths of the form ci where i n and neither nor contain c as a subpath we then set jn r f v n v rf since i j is finitely generated there necessarily exists n 0 for which i jn this observations allows us to prove that i is principal by using induction on the number of summands which appear in the above display call this number m leavitt path algebras are be zout 11 the m 1 case is established as follows by the induction hypothesis r is be zout if i r then proposition 9 can be invoked on the other hand if i rf for some f and then lemma 10 with f finishes the job so we assume that if i a 1 a 2 am 1 where each at is of the form rf and possibly at r for some unique t then i is principal we show that if i a 1 a 2 am where each at is of the form rf and possibly at r for some unique t then i is principal as well if i at 0 for some t then i is isomorphic via the projection along at to an ideal which is contained in a direct sum of m 1 a is and so we are done by induction hence we may assume that i at 6 0 for all 1 t m so in particular we have i aj 6 0 for some aj rf then i i aj i aj aj a 1 aj 1 aj 1 am so by induction we get i i aj is isomorphic to a principal left ideal that is since r is hereditary and hence any left ideal is projective i i aj is isomorphic to a direct summand of r r r moreover using again that i i aj is projective the short exact sequence 0 i aj i i i aj 0 splits and so i i aj i i aj so as a direct summand of i in particular we get that b i aj is both finitely generated and projective letw denote t r f and let denote the sum of the vertices inw then r is be zout by the induction hypothesis so we may apply proposition 11 to get that i aj is principal and is isomorphic to a direct summand of r so we have i i aj i i aj which is isomorphic to a direct summand of r r r now consider the cycle c for which c 0 v denote v by v 1 v 2 v and the edges of c by h 1 h 2 h with s hi vi and r hi vi 1 by the ck 2 relation we have v 1 h 1 h 1 f v s f v 1 ff so rv 1 rh 1 h 1 f v s f v 1 rff by lemma 6 parts 3 and 4 we have rv 2 rh 1 h 1 so that rv 1 rv 2 f v s f v 1 rff using this idea at each subsequent vertex of the cycle we eventually return back to v 1 and we get rv 1 rv 1 f v rff we denote f v rff by n so we have shown that rv 1 rv 1 n but by repeated substitution this then gives rv 1 rv 1 n s for any positive integer s we use this same idea to establish that rvi rvi n s for all 1 i and all positive integers s so i 1 rvi i 1 rvi n s for any positive integer s rephrased r r n s for any positive integer s now consider any vertex u t v v w then there is a path from v to u which necessarily must have as its initial edge an element f v so using the same argument as in the previous paragraphs by the ck 2 relations we have that for each u w ru is 12 gene abrams francesca mantese and alberto tonolo isomorphic to a direct summand of rff for some f v let p w then u w ru is isomorphic to a direct summand of np that is r is isomorphic to a direct summand of np so r r is isomorphic to a direct summand of n 2 p so r r r is isomorphic to a direct summand of r n 2 p which is isomorphic to a direct summand of r n s for some s sufficiently large but r n s in turn is isomorphic to r by the previous display in other words r r r is isomorphic to a direct summand of r now write 1 r then as left modules we have i is isomorphic to a direct summand of r r r so i is isomorphic to a direct summand of r r r r r r r r which by the previous display gives that i is isomorphic to a direct summand of r r but this last module is indeed a left ideal a direct summand of r so that i is isomorphic to a direct summand of r i e i is principal so we have established the first step of case 3 namely that any finitely generated left ideal i which is contained in j is principal next we establish the result for finitely generated left ideals i which contain j to do so we use some general results about leavitt path algebras see e g 3 we have that lk e j lk e h w where h w is the hereditary saturated closure of w in e and e h w is the graph gotten from e by eliminating all the vertices in h w and all attendant edges in particular if v is the set of vertices of a source cycle then lk e j lk v which it turns out to be isomorphic to mn k x x 1 as k algebras let as usual c e 1 en be the source cycle based on v 1 then specifically the isomorphism is given by pij x mn k x x 1 7 n i j 1 ipij c j where i ei en but mn k x x 1 is a principal ideal ring a proof is given in 17 theorem 40 specifically the left ideal i j of lk e j is principal say i j lk e j y so that i lk e y j for some y n i j 1 ipij c j r for any t n let dt r denote the element dt n i 1 ic t i then a straightforward computation yields that dty n i j 1 ic tpij c j moreover as left r ideals rdty ry because again by an easy computation we have d tdty y indeed d tdt and y y so if yt dty we may write i lk e yt j where dtd tyt yt leavitt path algebras are be zout 13 recall that for each positive integer m we have denoted by jm the left r ideal jm r f v mr ff r f v mrf let em denote the idempotent em f v m ff as the set of summands appearing in em is a set of orthogonal idempotents in r em itself is an idempotent clearly em jm and jm lk e em since i is finitely generated as a left r module we have that there exists m for which i lk e ym jm 1 but as lk e ym jm 1 lk e ym j i we have i lk e ym jm 1 lk e ym lk e em 1 remember that dmd mym ym on the other hand d mem 1 i i c m i f v m 1 ff i i c m i f v m 1 ff now by an easy computation we get c m i f 0 for each i and f since m 1 is the maximal power of c in any sequence vi c j vk m 1 we finally claim that lk e ym lk e em 1 lk e ym em 1 the inclusion is clear but dmd m ym em 1 ym 0 ym by the above computation so ym lk e ym em 1 and hence also em 1 belongs to lk e ym em 1 so we have established the second step of case 3 namely that any finitely generated left ideal i of r which is contained in j is principal we now use the two previously established steps to verify the result in the situation where i is not contained in j this will then complete the proof of case 3 since i i j i j j is a finitely generated ideal of the principal ideal ring lk e j mn k x x 1 then i i j i j j is cyclic as well generated by an element y y i so i ry i j notice that y y y where y i and y i j and i r y r y i j r y i j i since y i hence i r y i j notice that any element s j belongs to rem for a suitable idempotent em as defined before so it is of the form s rem i i i em we claim that there exists a suitable nk such that c k nks 0 for any k 1 n where ck denotes the cycle based in vk it is not restrictive to assume r to be a monomial and so consider the product em first notice that if c k t 6 0 for any t 0 then it has to be chkek ek for h 0 and suitable k and in such a case since v is a source it has to be and in particular e k e k 1 distributing over the summands of em we get expressions c h kek ek e k f each of those involving f v or so we can choose a suitable nk such that c k nk em 0 let now xj sj y tj for j 1 n be a set of generators for i with tj i j consider m rt 1 rtn then m is a finitely generated ideal in i j and in particular it is contained in j so now invoking the previously established first step of case 3 we have that m is principal generated by an element t j choose an n such that c k n t 0 so that 14 gene abrams francesca mantese and alberto tonolo cnk c k n t 0 for any k call cn k c n k and c n k c k n then c n t 0 notice that c ncn v 1 vn consider now i r y rt r cn y rt since y c n cn y we claim that i r cn y t clearly i r cn y t since t and y and so t cn y are in i for the other inclusion note that cn c n cn y t cn y cn c n t cn y so cn y r cn y t and hence t r cn y t thus rcn y rt r cn y t and so i r cn y t in summary we have shown that i is a principal ideal whenever i is a finitely generated ideal which is contained in j and also whenever i is a finitely generated ideal which is not contained in j so we have completed case 3 in the induction and thereby have established the theorem almost the entirety of the heavy lifting required to show that lk e is be zout for all graphs e has been completed by establishing the result for finite graphs i e theorem 15 corollary 16 let e be an arbitrary graph and k any field then lk e is be zout proof by 3 corollary 1 6 10 or by 15 theorem 4 1 lk e is the direct limit of unital subalgebras each of which is isomorphic to the leavitt path k algebra of a finite graph by theorem 15 each of these unital subalgebras is be zout so every finite set of elements of lk e is contained in a unital be zout subring of r now apply lemma 8 to provide some comparison with the previously mentioned work on principal ideal rings we offer the following proposition 17 let e be a finite graph then lk e is a principal ideal ring if and only if no cycle in e has an exit proof if no cycle in e has an exit then by 3 corollary 2 7 5 lk e is isomorphic as rings to a direct sum of copies of matrices over k and or matrices over k x x 1 but each of these is well known to be a principal ideal ring hence so is their direct sum on the other hand suppose there is a cycle in e which has an exit denote the cycle by c and without loss of generality assume that c is based at v and that the presumed exit f for the cycle has s f v for each positive integer i consider the element i ci c i ci 1 c i 1 lk e a straightforward computation yields that each i is an idempotent and that i j 0 for i 6 j moreover each i is nonzero since otherwise 0 i ic if cif ci 1 c f cif 0 cif which contradicts the previously mentioned property that ke embeds in lk e injectively so the left ideal i 1 lk e i of lk e is not finitely generated and therefore cannot be principal as one nice consequence of theorem 15 we get the following description of the finitely gen erated projective lk e modules which appear up to isomorphism as left ideals of lk e corollary 18 let e be an arbitrary graph and k any field let r lk e let p be a finitely generated projective left r module then p is isomorphic to a left ideal of r if and only if p is principal proof if p is isomorphic to a left ideal of r then corollary 16 gives the result conversely if p is principal then there exists r p 0 which splits since p is projective and so p is isomorphic to a direct summand of r and thus isomorphic to a left ideal of r leavitt path algebras are be zout 15 as another consequence of our main result we re establish the two sided version of the be zout property for leavitt path algebras corollary 19 18 corollary 8 let e be an arbitrary graph and k any field let i be a two sided ideal of r lk e which is finitely generated i e there exists x 1 x 2 xn r for which i n i 1 rxir then i is principal i e there exists x r with i rxr proof consider the finitely generated left ideal t n i 1 rxi of r then i tr as two sided ideals by corollary 16 there exists x r with t rx then i tr rxr as desired remark 20 in 9 it is shown that if v is a non isolated source vertex then lk e is morita equivalent to lk e v although at first glance one might think that this information could be useful in establishing case 2 in the proof of theorem 15 it indeed is not helpful in this context because the be zout property is in general not a morita invariant see e g 20 page 536 and or 19 page 625 we thank l small for pointing out these references we close the article with a remark about the usefulness of the main result in 5 we use the now established be zout property of leavitt path algebras to investigate the injectivity of a naturally occuring class of modules over lk e by means of a divisibility notion which arises in this setting the key tool is the fact that in a be zout ring the baer test on finitely generated ideals reduces to a divisibility property references 1 g abrams leavitt path algebras the first decade bull math sci 5 1 2015 59 120 2 g abrams p n a nh a louly and e pardo
