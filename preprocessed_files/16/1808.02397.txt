homological alge bra 1 we define a topology on modules over a not necessarily commutative ring r that coincides with the r topology defined by matlis when r is com mutative 2 we consider the class sf of strongly flat modules when r is a right ore domain with classical right quotient ring q strongly flat modules are flat the completion of r in its r topology is a strongly flat r module 3 we consider some results related to the question whether sf a covering class implies sf closed under direct limit this is a particular case of the so called enochs conjecture whether covering classes are closed under direct limit some of our results concerns right chain domains for instance we show that if the class of strongly flat modules over a right chain domain r is covering then r is right invariant in this case flat r modules are strongly flat 1 introduction the aim of this paper is to highlight some relations between completions strongly flat modules and perfect rings in the non commutative case we explore some connections between some notions of homological algebra cotorsion modules and topological rings completions in some natural topologies these connections are well known for modules over commutative rings thanks to matlis who proved that the completion in the r toplogy for an integral domain r is closely related to the cotorsion completion functor ext 1 r k here q is the field of fractions of r and k q r we investigate these connections in the non commutative case defining a suitable r topology on any module over a not necessarily commutative ring r this leads us to the study of strongly flat modules because the completion of r in its r topology turns out to be a strongly flat r module theorem 4 9 we consider strongly flat modules over non commutative rings as defined in 12 section 3 the class of strongly flat modules lies between the class of projective modules and the class of flat modules in particular we study when the class of strongly flat modules is covering because this is related to an open problem posed by enochs whether every covering class is closed under direct limit see for example 17 open problem 5 4 since flat modules are direct limits of projective modules the class of strongly flat modules is closed under direct limits if and only if flat modules are strongly flat bazzoni and salce 4 gave a complete answer key words and phrases

domains completely determining when the class of strongly flat modules over a commutative domain is covering subsequently bazzoni and positselski generalized this to arbitrary commutative rings in 5 they proved that for a commutative ring r the class sf of strongly flat modules is covering if and only if flat modules are strongly flat if and only if r ar is a perfect ring for every regular element a r in our example 5 18 we will show that there exist non invariant chain domains r for which end r i is perfect for every non zero principal right or left ideal i of r but the class of strongly flat left r modules is not covering very recent papers related to these topics are the articles 6 21 by bazzoni and positselski for a commutative ring r the set of regular elements is always an ore set and if q denotes the classical quotient ring of r the class of strongly flat modules is q 14 the generalization of strongly flat modules to non commutative rings given in 12 depends on the choice of the overringq of r more precisely if r q is a bimorphism in the category of rings that is is both a monomorphism and an epimorphism we assume that rq is a flat left r module we view at r as a subring of q and r q as the inclusion then a left r module rm is matlis cotorsion if ext 1 rq rm 0 12 let mc denote the class of matlis cotorsion left r modules for any class of left r modules a set a b r mod ext 1 r b a 0 for every a a and a b r mod ext 1 r a b 0 for every a a a left r module is strongly flat if it is in mc the class of strongly flat left r modules will be denoted by sf by 17 theorem 6 11 the cotorsion pair sf mc is complete that is every left r module has a specialmc preenvelope or equivalently every left module has a special sf precover thus by 17 corollary 6 13 the class sf consists of all direct summands of modules n such that n fits into an exact sequence of the form 0 f n g 0 where f is a free r module and g is q filtered for the terminology see 12 whenever r is a right ore domain i e the class of regular elements is a right ore set the class of strongly flat left r modules is the class q where q is the classical right quotient ring of r several of our results about strongly flat modules are for modules over a nearly simple chain domain recall that a chain domain r that is a not necessarily commutative integral domain for which the modules rr and rr are uniserial is nearly simple if it has exactly three two sided ideals necessarily r its jacobson radical j r and 0 the reason why we concentrate on chain domains r with classical quotient ring q is due to the fact that for these rings the r module rk q r is uniserial and thus in the study of end rk we can take advantage of our knowledge of the endomorphism rings of uniserial modules 9 10 11 13 22 23 in our example 5 18 we also take advantage of our knowledge of the endomorphism rings of cyclically presented modules over local rings 1 if r is a right chain domain and the class of strongly flat r modules is covering then r is right invariant that is ar ra for every a r in this case flat modules are strongly flat equivalently the class sf of strongly flat modules is closed under direct limit we began this paper in september 2017 when both of us where visiting the department of algebra of charles university in prague and continued in march 2018 when the first named author was visiting the ipm institute for research in covering classes strongly flat modules and completions 3 fundamental sciences in tehran we are very grateful to both institutions for their hospitality 2 the r topology in sections 2 3 and 4 of this paper we suppose that we have a ring r and a multiplicatively closed subset s of r satisfying 1 if a b r and ab s then a s 2 s is a right ore set in r 3 the elements of s are regular elements of r 4 the right ring of quotients q r s 1 of r with respect to s is a directly finite ring that is our setting is that of 12 section 4 correspondingly we have a gabriel topology g on r consisting of all the right ideals i of r with i s 6 cf 24 vi 6 in particular the gabriel topology g consists of dense right ideals of r the canonical embedding r q r s 1 is an epimorphism in the category of rings we view r as a subring of q and as the inclusion mapping and rq turns out to be a flat left r module 24 xi 3 there is a hereditary torsion theory t f on mod r in which the torsion submodule of any right r module mr consists of all the elements x mr for which there exists an element s s with xs 0 if we indicate the torsion submodule of m by t m then clearly t m r q 0 a right r module mr is in f that is is torsion free if and only if right multiplication s mr mr by s is an abelian group monomorphism for every s s dually we will say that a right r module mr is divisible if right multiplication s mr mr by s is an abelian group epimorphism for every s s that is if ms m for every s s every homomorphic image of a divisible right r module is divisible if a is a submodule of a right r module br and both ar and b a are divisible then br is divisible any sum of divisible submodules is a divisible submodule so that every right r module mr contains a greatest divisible submodule denoted by d mr a right r module mr is reduced if d mr 0 for every module mr mr d mr is reduced we have that g i i is a right ideal of r and i q q and g has a basis consisting of the principal right ideals sr s s let mr be any right r module by 24 xi proposition 3 4 the kernel of the canonical right r module morphism mr m r q is equal to t m note that if we set k q r then rkr is an r r bimodule and t mr tor r 1 mr rk see 15 and 16 in 12 section 3 we now define a topology on any right r module in the attempt of generalizing the r topology studied by matlis 19 for a commutative ring r our definition is as follows let r be any ring with identity not necessarily commutative and s be a subset of r with the properties written at the beginning of this section given any right r module mr the r topology on mr has a neighborhood base of 0 consisting for every non empty finite set of elements s 1 sn s of the submodules u s 1 sn x mr xr ms 1 msn of mr for the regular right module rr the r topology on r has a neighborhood base of 0 consisting for every non empty finite set of elements s 1 sn s of the right ideals u s 1 sn x r xr rs 1 rsn of r 4 alberto facchini and zahra nazemian lemma 2 1 on the right r module rr the right ideals u s are two sided ideals of r u s is the annihilator of the left r module r rs and the r topology is a ring topology on r proof clearly u s x r xr rs is the annihilator of the cylic left r module r rs and hence u s is a two sided ideal moreover r is a right linearly topological ring 24 p 144 because every filter of two sided ideals of a ring is a fundamental system of neighborhoods of 0 for a right and left linear topology on the ring 24 p 144 we will use rr top to denote the topological ring r with the r topology lemma 2 2 every right r module with respect to its r topology is a linearly topological module over the topological ring rr top proof it suffices to check property tm 3 in 24 p 144 that is we must prove that um s x ur s for every s s x mr equivalently that xur s um s now if r ur s then rr rs so that xrr xrs ms i e rx um s lemma 2 3 if the ring r is commutative the linear topology on any right r module m defined by the submodules u s s s coincides with the r topology defined by matlis in 19 proof u s x m xr ms ms in the next proposition we consider the behavior of continuity of right r module morphisms when the modules involved are endowed with the r topology recall that a submodule m of a right r module nr is an rd pure submodule if mr m nr for every r r equivalently if the natural homomorphism m r rr n r rr is injective for every r r or if the natural homomor phism hom r rr n hom r rr m is surjective for every r r see 26 proposition 2 proposition 2 4 a every right r module morphism f mr nr between two right r modules mr and nr endowed with their r topologies is continuous b for every right r module nr and every s s the r submodule u s of nr is the largest r submodule of nr contained in ns c a submodule mr of a right r module nr endowed with the r topology is an open submodule of nr if and only if mr u s for some s s d a right r module morphism f mr nr between two right r modules mr and nr with their r topologies is an open map if and only if f mr u s for some s s e every right r module epimorphism f mr nr between two right r modules mr and nr is an open continuous map f every right r module isomorphism f mr nr is a homeomorphism when the two right r modules mr and nr are endowed with their r topologies g if mr is an rd pure submodule of a right r module nr and mr nr are endowed with their r topologies then the embedding mr nr is a topological embedding the proofs are easy and we omit them covering classes strongly flat modules and completions 5 3 the right r module hom kr m r k in this section the hypotheses on r and s are the same as in the previous section for any right r module mr we will be interested in the right r module hom kr m r k here the right r module structure is given by the multiplication defined for every f hom kr m r k and r r by fr k f rk for all k k for any right r module mr the right r module hom kr m r k can be endowed with the r topology defined by the submodules u s 1 sn u s 1 u sn as a neighborhood base of 0 but we have that lemma 3 1 for the modules hom kr m r k one has that u s v s where for every element s s v s f hom kr m r k f rs 1 r 0 proof let f be an element of u s so that f hom kr m r k and fr hom kr m r k s in order to show that f v s we have to prove that f rs 1 r 0 fix r r then fr gs for some g hom kr m r k hence f rs 1 r fr s 1 r gs s 1 r g ss 1 r 0 thus f rs 1 r 0 suppose f v s so that f rs 1 r 0 in order to prove that f u s we must show that for every fixed element r r there exists g hom kr m r k with fr gs define g kr m r kr by g q r f rs 1 q r for all q q then g is a well defined right r module morphism because if q r then f rs 1 q r f rs 1 r q f rs 1 r r 0 and fr gs we will denote by v s 1 sn the intersection v s 1 v sn but it is necessary to remark that lemma 3 2 for every s s s there exists t s such that v s v s v t proof given s s s there exist t s and r r r with t sr s r 16 lemma 4 21 then s 1 rt 1 so that rs 1 rrt 1 rt 1 therefore v t v s because if f hom kr m rk and f rt 1 r 0 then f rs 1 r 0 that is f v s similarly v t v s a right or left r module mr is h divisible if every homomorphism rr mr extends to an r module morphism qr mr 12 section 2 any right or left r module m contains a unique largest h divisible submodule h m that contains every h divisible submodule of m an r module mr is h reduced if h mr 0 or equivalently if hom qr mr 0 12 obviously h divisible right r modules are divisible proposition 3 3 divisible torsion free right r modules are q modules in par ticular h mr d mr for any torsion free right r module mr 6 alberto facchini and zahra nazemian proof suppose mr torsion free and divisible then right multiplication by s is an automorphism of the abelian group m for every s s by the universal property of q r s 1 the canonical ring antihomomorphism r endz m extends to a ring antihomomorphism q endz m in a unique way that is there is a unique right q module structure on m that extends the right r module structure of mr thus m is a right q module in particular it is an h divisible right r module let mr be a right r module for every element x mr there is a right r module morphism rr mr 1 7 x tensoring with rk we get a right r module morphism x kr m r k defined by x k x k the canonical mapping mr hom kr m r k defined by x x for every x mr is a right r module morphism as is easily checked in the rest of this section all r modules are endowed with their r topologies theorem 3 4 let mr be an h reduced torsion free right r module then the canonical mapping mr hom kr m r k is an embedding of topological modules and hom kr m r k is complete proof the canonical mapping mr hom kr m r k is injective by 12 theorem 4 5 in order to show that mr hom kr m r k is an em bedding of topological modules it suffices to show that 1 v s 1 sn u s 1 sn for every s 1 sn s now x 1 v s 1 sn if and only if x v s 1 sn that is if and only if x rs 1 1 rs 1 1 r 0 in m r k equivalently if and only if x rs 1 i r 0 in m r k for every r r and i 1 2 n by 12 step 3 of the proof of theorem 4 5 this is equivalent to xr msi for every r r and i 1 2 n that is if and only if x u s 1 sn in order to prove that hom kr m rk is complete we must show that every cauchy net converges let a be a directed set with order relation and let f a be a cauchy net in hom kr m rk define a morphism f hom kr m rk as follows since we are dealing with a cauchy net for every s s there exists a such that f f v s for every a set f rs 1 r f rs 1 r for every r r we leave to the reader the easy verification that f is a well defined mapping let us check that f kr f k r for every k kr and r r we have that k as 1 r for some a r s s by the right ore condition there exist r r and t s such that as 1 r r t 1 since a is directed there exists such that f r t 1 r f r t 1 r and f as 1 r r f as 1 r r therefore f kr f k r it is now easily seen that f is the limit of the cauchy net for any right r module mr endowed with its r topology the hausdorff com pletion ofmr is m r lim m u s 1 sn notice that the set of all the submod ules u s 1 sn of mr is downward directed under inclusion here s 1 sn ranges in the set of all finite subsets of s there is a canonical mapping m m r whose kernel is the closure 0 of 0 in the r topology of mr clearly 0 s 1 sn s u s 1 sn s s u s x mr xr s s ms from lemma 2 2 we get that if mr is a right r module the right r module hom kr m r k with the topology defined by the submodules v s is a topo logical module over the topological ring rr top covering classes strongly flat modules and completions 7 proposition 3 5 the right r submodules v s of the ring end kr are two sided ideals of end kr the topology they define on end kr is a ring topology if r is commutative this topology on end kr coincides with the topology on the completion h of r with respect to the r topology 19 p 15 proof when we considerm rr then by 12 step 2 of the proof of theorem 4 5 the elements of k annihilated by right multiplications of an element s s are those of rs 1 r it follows that rs 1 r is a fully invariant submodule of kr from this we get that every v s is a two sided ideal of the ring end kr every filter of two sided ideals of a ring is a fundamental system of neighborhoods of 0 for a right and left linear topology on the ring 24 p 144 thus the topology defined by the two sided ideals v s is a ring topology on end kr moreover if r is commutative the submodules v s define the r topology on the right r module hom kr m r k for every module m lemma 2 2 which coincides with the r topology defined by matlis in 19 by lemma 2 3 finally matlis r topology on end kr coincides with the topology on the completion h of r with respect to the r topology because the topology on the completion h coincides with the r topology on h 4 torsion free modules in this section we keep the same hypotheses and notations as in the previous two sections as we have seen for any rightr modulemr there is a rightr module morphism mr hom kr m r k defined by x x for every x mr where x k x k and there is a canonical mapping m m r of mr with its r topology into its hausdorff completion proposition 4 1 let mr be a torsion free right r module then a ker is the closure of 0 in the r topology b ker is the kernel of the canonical mapping m m r and c ker is equal to h mr proof we have already remarked that the kernel of is the closure of 0 of 0 hence a b the right r module hom kr nr is h reduced for every right r module nr 12 theorem 2 8 let mr be a torsion free right r module since mr hom kr m r k is a homomorphism into an h reduced r module it follows that h m ker let us prove that ker 0 suppose x ker then x rs 1 r is equal to zero in the tensor product m k by 12 theorem 3 1 1 there exists an element yr s mr such that x rs 1 yr s 1 inm rq thus xr 1 yr ss 1 in m r q since mr is torsion free it follows that xr yr ss in mr by 12 theorem 3 1 1 again this proves that xr s s ms and so ker 0 conversely 0 ker because if x 0 then xr ms for every s s that is for every s s and every r r there exists mr s m with xr mr ss then for every element rs 1 r k we have that x rs 1 r xr s 1 r mr ss s 1 r mr s s s 1 r 0 in m r k thus x ker this proves that 0 ker therefore a and b hold we now show that ker is divisible for every s s s is invertible in q hence sq q so sk k now if x ker and t s then x 0 hence x yt for 8 alberto facchini and zahra nazemian some y mr we must prove that y ker that is that y k 0 in m k but y k y sk ys k x k 0 inm k this proves that ker 0 is divisible thus ker h m by proposition 3 3 clearly from proposition 4 1 we have that corollary 4 2 if mr is a torsion free module then m r mr h m lemma 4 3 let m be torsion free right r module then a every element of m r k can be written in the form x s 1 r for suitable elements x mr and s s b let s be an element of s the elements y of m r k such that ys 0 are those that can be written in the form x s 1 r for a suitable x mr c if x mr r r and s s then x rs 1 r 0 in m r k if and only if xr ms d the set u s s s is downward directed proof in the proof of steps 1 2 and 3 of 12 theorem 4 5 we do not use the fact that m is h reduced so the proofs of a b and c are like those of steps 1 2 and 3 in 12 theorem 4 5 d assume that s t s then there exist u s and r 1 r 2 r such that s 1 r 1 u 1 and t 1 r 2 u 1 if m u u and r r then m rs 1 r m rr 1 u 1 r 0 part c implies that m u s and so u u u s similarly u u u t remark 4 4 by lemma 4 3 d for m torsion free we have that m lim m u s notice that the kernel of the canonical mapping m m is divisible by theorem 4 1 now let mr be a torsion free right r module so that mr hom kr m r k is continuous with respect to the r topologies proposition 2 4 a and hom kr m r k is hausdorff notice that m r k and m h m r k are isomorphic so that hom kr m rk is complete theorem 3 4 thus extends in a unique way to a continuous morphism m hom kr m r k in theorem 4 5 and example 4 6 we see that is a continuous monomorphism but not necessary an isomorphism theorem 4 5 let mr be a torsion free right r module then there exists a right r module monomorphism m hom kr m r k such that proof define as follows we know that m lim m u s s s m u s so that every element of m is of the form m ms u s s s set m rs 1 r ms rs 1 r for every r r s s in order to prove that m kr m rk is a well defined mapping and is r linear note first of all that if s t s are such covering classes strongly flat modules and completions 9 that u t u s and r r then ms mt u s implies that ms rs 1 r mt rs 1 r by lemma 4 3 c from this it is easily shown that is a well defined r module morphism also notice that now we prove that is a monomorphism suppose that m ms u s s s is in ker then for any k k and any s s with ks 0 we have that ms k 0 in m r k in particular for every r r s s the identity rs 1 r s 0 implies that ms rs 1 r in m r k by lemma 4 3 c this means that msr ms for every r and s hence ms u s for every s s this shows that is injective example 4 6 let r be the nearly simple chain domain in 8 example 6 5 in that example the r module q r can be chosen to be countably generated because the group g is countable and so is its positive cone p if the skew field k in that example is countable then k p is countable in order to construct the ring r the authors consider a right and left ore subset s of k p which is necessarily countable because k p is countable and then they set r k p s 1 therefore if the skew field k is countable then r is countable and so q r is a countably generated r module as rr is torsion free its completion is lim r u s by remark 4 4 and for every non zero element s of j r u s 0 because r is nearly simple so r lim r u s let us prove that r end kr the module kr is a countably generated uniserial torsion locally coherent module that is every finitely generated submodule is coherent by 23 proposition 8 1 the module kr is not quasi small since uniserial modules with a local endomorphism ring are quasi small 10 the ring end kr cannot be isomorphic to r the same argument applies to any nearly simple chain domain r with q r countably generated proposition 4 7 if r is a topological ring with a basis b of neighborhoods of zero consisting of two sided ideals and r i is a local ring for every proper ideal i b then the hausdorff completion of r is either 0 or a local ring remark 4 8 the case of completion of r equal to zero concernes only the trivial case of b r we will not consider this case in the proof proof let mi be the maximal ideal of r such that mi i is the maximal ideal of r i for every proper ideal i b if i j b then considering the canonical projection r i j r i one sees that m i j mi it follows that there exists a maximal ideal m of r such that mi m for every proper ideal i b the completion of r is the inverse limit of the rings r i which is a subring of the ring i b r i which has i b m i as a two sided ideal whose intersection n with the inverse limit is a two sided ideal of the inverse limit let us prove that the inverse limit is a local ring with maximal ideal n it suffices to show that every element of the inverse limit not in n is invertible let xi i i b be an element in the inverse limit but not in n thus xi r and for i j r with i j we have that xi xj j i e xi i is mapped to xj j via the canonical projection r i r j also xi m for some proper ideal i of b it follows that xi m for every proper ideal i of b thus xi i m i hence is invertible in r m let yi i be the inverse of xi i in r i now the ring morphism r i r j maps inverses to inverses this shows that yi i i b is an element of the inverse limit and concludes the proof 10 alberto facchini and zahra nazemian therefore the completion of any local ring in the r topology is a local ring note that by theorem 4 5 and 12 proposition 2 6 if mr is torsion free then m r is torsion free theorem 4 9 let r be a right ore domain and r r the completion of rr in the r topology then r r is a strongly flat right r module proof we can apply the results of 12 section 3 which are right left symmetric that is hold for both right r modules and left r modules notice that rr is h reduced we have the short exact sequence 1 0 rr end kr ext 1 r rqr rr 0 we know that r r is a submodule of end kr that contains rr hence r r rr is isomorphic to a submodule of ext 1 r rqr rr in particular r r rr is torsion free because ext 1 r rqr rr is a q module hence torsion free let us prove that r r rr is divisible i e that r r rr r r r rr for every non zero r r equivalently we must prove that r r r rr rr now rr is dense in r r so that for every r r r and every non zero element s of r we have that r u s rr 6 in particular r u r rr 6 notice that u r r rr because for every x u r we have that xr r rr hence x r rr it follows that r r rr rr 6 thus there exists r r r and r rr with r r r r therefore r r r r r rr rr this proves that r r rr is divisible and torsion free hence a module over the division ring q thus r r rr q x for some set x the short exact sequence 0 rr r r q x 0 shows that r r is strongly flat 5 strongly flat modules in all this section we consider two rings r and q a bimorphism r q in the category of rings that is is both a monomorphism and an epimorphism and we assume that rq is a flat left r module for simplicity we will view r as a subring of q and r q as the inclusion let us recall some properties of such an inclusion r q it is always possible to suppose q qmax r the maximal ring of quotients of r 24 proof of theorem xi 4 1 the inclusion r q is an epimorphism in the category of rings if and only if the canonical r r bimodule morphism q r q q induced by the multiplication q q q of the ring q is an r r bimodule isomorphism 24 proposition xi 1 2 the family of all the subrings q of qmax r with r q a bimorphism and rq flat is directed under inclusion 24 lemma xi 4 2 its direct limit is the maximal flat epimorphic right ring of quotients qtot r of r see the paragraph after the proof of corollary 5 7 by 25 theorem 4 8 ext 1 rm rn ext 1 qm qn for any pairm n of left q modules and similarly for right q modules lemma 5 1 divisible strongly flat left r modules are projective q modules covering classes strongly flat modules and completions 11 proof assume that rd is a divisible strongly flat module since k q 0 we have k d 0 since rd is flat we have d q d for any exact sequence 0 r x d t q y 0 the corresponding exact sequence 0 q x d q t q y 0 splits therefore d is a projective q module recall that any left perfect ring is directly finite the following result shows that when rsf is covering then q is left perfect thus the results is the same as in the commutative case but the proof is necessarily different theorem 5 2 if all left q modules have a strongly flat cover as left r modules then q is left perfect proof assume that qm is a left q module and f rs rm is a strongly flat cover of rm then we have an epimorphism 1 f q s m 1 f q s 7 qf s since rs is strongly flat qq r s is a direct summand of a direct sum of copies of q i e it is a projective left q module since projective left q modules are strongly flat left r modules the left r module rq s is strongly flat but f is a strongly flat precover of m so that there exists g q s s with fg 1 f note that rs is flat and so s can be embedded in q s that is there is a left r module monomorphism h rs r q r s defined by h s 7 1 s then f gh f and thus gh is an automorphism of rs because f rs r m is a cover thus gh 1 gh 1 so that e h gh 1 g is an idempotent endomorphism of the left r module rq s hence e is an idempotent endomorphism of the left q module qq s this shows that qq s is the direct sum of the image and the kernel of e which are q modules but the image of e is the image of h hence the splitting monomorphism h s 7 1 s induces by corestriction a right r module isomorphism of rs onto the q module qh s by 12 section 2 7 if a left r module ra is a left q module qa then its unique left q module structure is given by the canonical isomorphism hom rq ra ra therefore s has a unique left q module structure which extends its left r module structure and as such qs is a projective q module thus f qs qm is a left q module morphism note that projective q modules are strongly flat and so f qs qm is a projective cover of qm therefore q is left perfect the following result has a proof similar to that of 4 proposition 2 4 1 and 2 lemma 5 3 let a be a module with a strongly flat cover and let 2 0 c m a 0 be a special strongly flat precover of a then the exact sequence 2 is a strongly flat cover if and only if c is mc small i e c h m and c h matlis cotorsion imply h m theorem 5 4 let i be a two sided ideal of r such that iq q if all left r i modules have a strongly flat cover as left r modules then r i is left perfect proof it is enough to show that every left r i module has a projective r i cover let m be an r i module and f ra rm be a strongly flat cover of rm since im 0 we have that ia ker f since ra is strongly flat there exists an exact sequence 0 r x a t q y 0 where x and y are sets since iq q 12 alberto facchini and zahra nazemian we have r i q 0 thus we see that a ia is a projective left r i module so f induces a map h a ia m h a ia 7 f a and ker h ker f ia now ra is strongly flat and iq q and so a ia is a projective left r i module we now show that h is a cover form or equivalently that ker f ia is small in a ia assume that t ker f a where t is an r module of a that ia t since iq q hom q ker f ker f t 0 on the other hand since f ra rm is a strongly flat cover of rm the module ker f is matlis cotorsion by wakamatsu lemma see 17 lemma 5 13 and thus ker f t is matlis cotorsion therefore t a by lemma 5 3 lemma 5 5 assume that r is a local ring with jacobson radical j let 0 c s m 0 be an sf cover for m then c js proof assume that c js then js 6 s since r j is a division ring there exists a proper submodule t js of s js such that t js c js js s js consequently t c s consider the exact sequence 0 t c c s t 0 let us show that hom q s t 0 note that rr is essential in qr because q is a subring of qmax r thus if x q r then the right ideal of i r xr r is proper ideal of r and so i j by 15 part b of theorem 3 9 iq q and so jq q if hom q s t 6 0 then there exists a proper submodule e of q such that q e is isomorphic to a submodule of s t thus q jq e which is a contradiction therefore hom q s t 0 and so t c q since c is mc small we have t s which is a contradiction it is known that if r is commutative q is the field of fractions of r and rsf is covering then p dim rq 1 we do not know what occurs in the non commutative case therefore we now study the projective dimension of rq proposition 5 6 suppose rq is a projective left r module then rq is a finitely generated left r module proof since rq is projective it has a dual basis 2 exercise 11 pp 202 203 that is there are elements x q and morphisms f rq rr a such that for all x q f x 6 0 for only finitely many a and x a f x x applying the functor qq r r mod q mod we get left q module morphisms 1 f qq r q qq r r now there are left q module isomorphisms q qq r q q 7 1 q and qq r r qq q r 7 qr composing we get left q module endomorphisms qq qq which are necessarily right multiplications by elements y q now for all x q f x 6 0 for only finitely many a for x 1 we get that there is a finite subset f of a such that f 1 0 for every a f thus 1 f 1 1 0 for every a f it follows that right multiplication by y maps 1 to 0 that is y 0 for every a f it follows that 1 f qq r q qq r r is the zero mapping for every a f thus 1 f q q is the zero element of qq rr for every q q q hence 1 f q is the zero element of qq rr it remains to show that the mapping rr qq rr r 1 r is injective which is easily seen because torr 1 k r 0 this proves that f 0 for every a f as a consequence rq is isomorphic to a direct summand of rr f so that rq is a finitely generated left r module corollary 5 7 let r be a ring s a multiplicatively closed subset of regular ele ments of r and suppose that s is a right denominator set so that the right ring covering classes strongly flat modules and completions 13 of fractions q r s 1 exists if rq is a projective left r module then q r that is all the elements of s are invertible in r proof by proposition 5 6 there are finitely many elements r 1 s 1 1 rns 1 n that generateq as a left r module reducing to the same denominator 16 lemma 4 21 we find elements r i r and s s such that sir i s for every i multiply ing by s 1 on the right and by s 1 i on the left we get that r is 1 s 1 i thus q n i 1 rr 1 s 1 1 rs 1 1 this proves that q rs 1 1 in particular s 2 rs 11 from which 1 rs let t r be such that 1 ts then t s 1 in q thus q rs 11 rt r hence q r on page 235 of 24 stenstro m asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for qmax r to be equal toqtot r he shows that ifqmax r is a right kasch ring i e a ring that contains a copy of its simple right modules then qmax r qtot r if r is right hereditary right noetherian 24 example 3 p 235 or commutative noetherian 24 example 4 p 237 or a right goldie ring 24 theorem xii 2 5 then qmax r is known to be kasch example 5 8 here is an example of a ring r for which qtot r qmax r is a projective right and left r module but r 6 qmax r let r be the ring of all lower triangular 2 2 matrices over a field f the ring r is right nonsingular and e rr s 0 r qmax r is a projective right and left r module 15 exercise 14 on page 78 and corollary 2 31 in goodearl s notation s 0 a e a z aa the injective envelope of a z aa for any ring a more precisely qmax r is the 2 2 matrix ring over the field f which is a semisimple artinian ring hence a right and left kasch ring and so qmax r qtot r as we have seen above we are now ready to consider the case of p dim rq 1 recall that a cotorsion pair a b is said to be hereditary if extir a b 0 for all i 1 a a and b b note that if f is the class of flat modules and ec the class of enochs cotorstion modules the the cotorsion pair f ec is always a hereditary cotorsion pair similarly to 17 lemma 7 53 we can show that lemma 5 9 the following conditions are equivalent for the pair of rings r q a p dim rq 1 b the cotorsion pair sf mc is hereditary proof a b assume that p dim rq 1 then strongly flat modules which are summands of extensions of a direct sum of copies of q by a free module are of p dim at most 1 thus the cotorsion pair sf mc is hereditary b a by 3 theorem 3 5 it is enough to show that that ext 1 k m is h reduced matlis cotorsion using the exact sequence 0 m e m e m m 0 we have the exact sequence 0 a b ext 1 k m 0 where a hom k e m hom k m and b hom k e m m note that for every module n hom k n is matlis cotorsion and h reduced by 12 theorem 2 8 so ext 1 k m is h reduced if and only if a q now a q follows from the fact that sf mc is hereditary and the exact sequence 0 hom k m hom k e m a 0 as the module a is matlis cotorsion from the exact sequence 0 a b ext 1 k m 0 and the fact that sf mc is hereditary we get that ext 1 k m is matlis cotorsion as a consequence rsf rf implies p dim rq 1 14 alberto facchini and zahra nazemian lemma 5 10 let r be a right ore domain and q the classical right quotient ring of r if s is a strongly flat left r module then s h s is also strongly flat proof assume that r is not a division ring there exists an exact sequence 0 r x s c q y 0 we claim that hom q r 0 otherwise i e if rq can be embeded in rr there exists a monomorphism rq r r then can be viewed as a monomorphism rq rq this monomorphism is right multiplication by an element q of q now a monomorphism implies q 6 0 and r right ore domain implies q division ring hence q is invertible in q so that r q which is a contradiction this proves our claim now we have the embedding hom q s c hom q q y so we have an exact sequence 0 r x s c h s c q y h s c 0 since h s c is a torsion free divisible module it is a q module but q is division ring so h s c is a direct summand of q y it follows that s h s is strongly flat a left coherent ring is a ring over which every finitely generated left ideal is finitely presented or equivalently intersection of two finitely generated left ideals is finitely generated theorem 5 11 assume that r is a left coherent ore domain with classical right quotient q a left ideal ri of r is a strongly flat left module if and only if ri is finitely generated projective proof assume ri a non zero strongly flat we have the exact sequence of r r bimodules 0 r q q r k 0 since ri is flat we get the exact sequence of left r modules 0 r i q i k i 0 therefore k i q i r i we want to show r i embeds in k i as r modules consider the sequence of left r modules 0 ri rq rq i 0 and apply to it the functor q r since qr is flat we get to an exact sequence 0 q r i q r q q r q i 0 under the natural isomorphism f q r q q the image of q i is qi q because i is non zero and the image of r i is i and so k i q i r i q i as a left r module now r i q i implies that r i embeds in k i as r module there exists an exact sequence 0 r x i t q y 0 since k r q 0 we conclude that k i and so r i embed in k x as left r modules consequently there exists an element x rk x whose annihilator is equal to i but the annihilator of an element of k x is equal to the intersection of finitely many annihilators of elements of k if ab 1 r rk then ann ab 1 r r rba 1 note that r rba 1 ra rb which is a finitely generated left ideal of r because r is left coherent thus i is a finitely generated left ideal of r and since it is flat i is projective 18 theorem 4 30 lemma 5 12 let r be a right ore ring with classical right quotient ring q then the strongly flat cover of any h reduced flat left r module is h reduced proof assume that m is a flat h reduced module and 0 c s m 0 is a strongly flat cover of m since m is h reduced we can assume that d h c h s so we have an exact sequence 0 c d s d m 0 by lemma 5 10 s d is strongly flat we can easily see that this sequence is a strongly flat precover for m note that c is torsion free and so d is a left q module thus ext 1 r q d 0 since c is mc small in s we see that c d is covering classes strongly flat modules and completions 15 mc small it follows that 0 c d s d m 0 is a strongly flat cover of m by lemma 5 3 2 and so s s d therefore d 0 proposition 5 13 assume that r is an ore local domain with classical quotient ring q suppose that k r s is direct sum of copies of k for every strongly flat module rs if rsf is a covering class then rsf rf proof firstly notice that left q modules are injective as r modules because r is both a right and a left ore domain so ifm is flat then h m is a direct summand of m and therefore m h m m h m clearly q modules are strongly flat and thus it is enough to show that any flat h reduced module is strongly flat let m be an h reduced flat left module and 0 c s m 0 be a strongly flat cover of m by lemma 5 12 s is also h reduced and thus c is an h reduced flat left r module assume that c 6 0 and let 0 c s c 0 be a strongly flat cover of c then s is matlis cotorsion h reduced strongly flat note that by the left version of 12 theorem 4 6 we have an exact sequence 0 s hom k k s ext 1 q s 0 thus s hom k k s since s is strongly flat it is a direct summand of a direct sum of copies of k and thus k s is isomorphic to a direct summand of a direct sum of copies of k k s k z say thus s hom k k s hom k k z hom k k r z by 12 theorem 4 6 we have an exact sequence 0 r z hom k k r z ext 1 q r z 0 since ext 1 q r z is a left q module r j ext 1 q r z 0 where j denotes the jacobson radical ofr consequently js 6 s on the other hand by lemma 5 5 and considering the pure exact sequence 0 c s m 0 we see that jc c by lemma 5 5 and considering the exact sequence 0 c s c 0 again we see that js s which is a contradiction this proves that c 0 so that m is strongly flat for any left module rm let add rm denote the class of all left r modules isomorphic to direct summands of direct sums of copies of rm we will say that add rm is trivial if every direct summand of a direct sum of copies of rm is a direct sum of copies of rm lemma 5 14 let r be a nearly simple chain domain and let rk be the uniserial left r module q r suppose add rk not trivial then there exists a submod ule v of rk that is not quasismall moreover all the elements of add rk are isomorphic to r modules of the form rk x r v y proof see 22 theorem 1 1 ii in the next proposition we describe uniserial strongly flat modules over ore domains proposition 5 15 if r is an ore domain with classical quotient ring q then every non zero uniserial strongly flat left module over r is isomorphic to rq or rr proof let ru be a non zero uniserial strongly flat left module over an ore domain r since ru is flat considering the exact sequence 0 r q we have an embedding u q r u hence the annihilator of every non zero element of ru is zero and so cyclic submodules of u are isomorphic to rr in particular the ring r is a left chain ring moreover u is the union of cyclic submodules isomorphic to rr that is a direct linearly ordered system of copies of rr where 16 alberto facchini and zahra nazemian the connecting homomorphisms are right multiplications by non zero elements of r applying the functor rq r since tensor product commutes with direct limits we get that rq r u is a direct limit of a direct system copies of rq in which the connecting isomorphisms are right multiplications by non zero elements of r that is the connecting isomorphisms are all left r module automorphisms of rq that is rq r u r q hence ru embeds into rq r u rq if this embedding is onto then ru rq if the embedding is not onto then ru is isomorphic to a proper submodule of rq hence to a left ideal of r by theorem 5 11 ru is cyclic and so isomorphic to rr lemma 5 16 let r be a nearly simple chain domain with jacobson radical j if add k is not trivial v is as in lemma 5 14 and m hom k v x where x is a non empty set then jm 6 m that is m has maximal submodule proof the module m hom rk rv is a left r module because rkr is a bi module notice that rm always has a direct summand isomorphic to hom k v so that we can suppose that x has exactly one element by 22 ii of theorem 1 1 k has an endomorphism whose image is contained in v say rk rv that is injective but not surjective let us show that is in m but not in jm for every j j and hom rk rv the left r module morphism j is not injective in fact j is right multiplication by j viewed as a morphism rk rk composed with rk rv thus the first morphism annihilates the element j 1 r so that the kernel of j is non zero this proves that j is not injective for j 6 0 but also when j 0 j is not injective now every element of jm a finite sum of elements of the form j i e of non injective homomorphisms hence is not injective because rk is uniserial hence uniform therefore rk rv is not an element of jm recall that a two sided ideal i of r is completely prime if xy i implies that x i or y i for every x y r theorem 5 17 if r is a right chain domain with classical right quotient ring q such that rsf is a covering class then r is invariant and rsf rf proof if i is a non zero completely prime two sided ideal of r r i is a left perfect domain by theorem 5 4 and so it is is a division ring since j r i is an ideal of r i we conclude that the only proper non zero completely prime ideal of r is j r a chain domain r is said to be of rank one if j r is its only non zero completely prime ideal by 8 such a ring is either invariant i e ar ra for all a r or it is nearly simple in which case 0 and j r are the only two sided ideals or r is exceptional and there exists a non zero prime ideal p properly contained in j r in this last case n pn 0 and there are no further ideals between p and j r in the second and the third case j r is not neither right nor left finitely generated and j 2 j now we break the proof in three steps step 1 the ring r cannot be exceptional the jacobson radical of r p is j p which cannot be nilpotent because j 2 j thus r p cannot have a t nilpotent jacobson radical see for example the proof of 20 lemma 3 33 and so r p is neither a right nor a left perfect ring and so the class of strongly flat left modules is not covering by theorem 5 4 step 2 the ring r cannot be nearly simple chain domain covering classes strongly flat modules and completions 17 suppose r a nearly simple chain domain for every strongly flat module rs k s is direct summand of a direct sum of copies of k so that k s belongs to add k we have two cases add k is trivial or not if add k is trivial then rsf covering implies rsf rf by proposition 5 13 but every cyclic finitely generated ideal of r is flat projective so rj must be flat hence strongly flat see for example 27 theorem 39 12 2 thus j must be finitely generated by theorem 5 11 which is a contradiction now assume that add k is not trivial by lemma 5 14 there exists a uniserial module v which is not quasismall and every element in add k is in form of k y v x for suitable sets x and y let 0 c s j 0 be a strongly flat cover of j by lemma 5 12 s is also h reduced and so c is an h reduced flat left module assume c 6 0 and let 0 c s c 0 be a strongly flat cover of c then s is matlis cotorsion h reduced strongly flat by the left version of 12 theorem 4 6 we have an exact sequence 0 s hom k k s ext 1 q s 0 so s hom k k s since s is strongly flat k s is a direct summand of a direct sum of copies of k therefore there exist sets x and y such that k s k y v x so s hom k k s hom k k y hom k v x as we saw in the proof of theorem 5 13 if y is non empty we can consider the exact sequence 0 ry hom k k r y ext 1 r q r y 0 and conclude that j hom k k y 6 hom k k y similarly by lemma 5 16 if x is non empty j hom k v x 6 hom k v x consequently js 6 s by lemma 5 5 considering the pure exact sequence 0 c s j 0 we see that jc c by lemma 5 5 again from the exact sequence 0 c s c 0 we get that js s which is a contradiction this proves that c 0 so that j is strongly flat which contradicts theorem 5 11 step 3 the ring r is invariant and rsf rf by steps 1 and 2 the ring r must be invariant therefore the endomorphism ring of every uniserial module is local the proof is similar to the commutative case because like in the proof of 13 corollary 3 every uniserial module is unshrinkable and so the endomorphism ring of every uniserial module is local like in the proof of 11 example 2 3 e thus end kr is local and every direct summand of copies of k is isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of k because kr is uniserial by 9 proposition 2 2 thus rsf rf by proposition 5 13 we conclude with an example concerning right noetherian right chain domains in a right noetherian right chain domain r all right ideals are principal and two sided 7 lemma 3 2 in particular j r pr for some p r the right noetherian right chain domain r is said to be of type 7 p 26 and lemma 3 4 if its chain of right ideals two sided ideals is the chain r p 0 r j r pr p 2 r 0 n 0 pnr thus for every non zero right ideal i of r we have that end rr i r i is a right artinian ring hence a perfect ring in the next example we show that this is also true for every non zero principal left ideal i of a right noetherian right chain domain r of type which is not left ore notice that in our example of right noetherian right chain domain of type which is not left ore the ring is not left chain otherwise it would be left ore and is not left noetherian 7 proposition 3 7 the main example of such a ring can be constructed with the skew poynomial 18 alberto facchini and zahra nazemian ring with coefficients in a field f where f has an endomorphism that is not an automorphism of f example 5 18 let r be a right noetherian right chain domain of type which is not left ore for every non zero principal left ideal i of r the endomorphism ring end rr i is a perfect ring proof for every non zero element x r we have that xr pnr for some n 0 therefore x pnu for some invertible element u r right multiplication by u induces an isomorphism r rpn r rx hence it suffices to show that end r rpn is right and left perfect for n 1 notice that rpn pnr set s end r rpn e rpn where e r r pnr rpn denotes the idealizer of rpn in r and set k r r pnr jpn by 1 theorem 2 1 s has at most two maximal ideals the ideals k rpn and j e rpn let us show that k j assume the contrary so that k contains a unit u of r therefore pnu rpn for some r j then r pjv for some unit v of r and some j 1 thus pn pjvpnu 1 if j n then 1 pj nvpnu 1 which implies j r r a contradiction if j n then pn j vpnu 1 thus pn j belongs to the two sided ideal pr of r which is a contradiction because n j n therefore k j so s is local with maximal ideal j e rpn we claim that if pny e then pny rpn to prove the claim assume that pny e then there exists s r such that pnpny spn similarly there exists i 0 and a unit u in r such that s piu if i n then we are done the claim is proved otherwise if i n by supposing that y pjv for some unit v we get that u 1 plv pn so l n which is a contradiction by 1 lemma 2 3 therefore j e n jn e pnr e rpn to that the jacobson radical j s je rpn of the local ring s is nilpotent it follows that s end r rpn is a right and left perfect ring references 1 b amini a amini and a facchini equivalence of
