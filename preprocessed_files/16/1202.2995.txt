cosmology of peoples friendship university of russia miklukho maklaya str 6 117198 moscow russia abstract a set of basic vectors locally describing metric properties of an arbitrary 2 dimensional 2 d surface is used for construction of fundamental algebraic objects having nilpotent and idempotent properties it is shown that all possible linear combinations of the objects when multiplied behave as a set of hypercomples in particular quaternion units thus interior structure of the 3 d space dimensions pointed by the vector units is exposed geometric representations of elementary surfaces 2 d sells structuring the dimensions are studied in detail established mathematical link between a vector quaternion triad treated as a frame in 3 d space and elementary 2 d sells prompts to raise an idea of world screen having 1 2 of a space dimension but adequately reflecting kinematical properties of an ensemble of 3 d frames keywords hypercomplex number quaternion spinor world screen 1 introduction raise of interest to the mathematics of hypercomplex hp numbers has been defi nitely manifested in the last decade e g 1 4 it was provoked not only by a dissipa tion of energy in aging physical theories of the gone century but rather by growing understanding of deep yet not completely revealed content of the mathematics of fering a fruitful field for theoretical thought one physical domain obviously linked with hp numbers is quantum theory with associative but often non commuting operators that resemble objects from the bi quaternion bq set 5 6 on the other hand the set is well known to comfortably represent main relations of theories of relativity 7 8 this pure mathematical relationship of still incompatible quantum physics and general relativity gravitation may one day make a path to reconcile the theories whether or not this occur the detailed study of hp algebras al ready now demonstrate its benefit allowing to find many physical correlations in this remarkably rich mathematical medium 9 here the study of basic elements of hp numbers set is continued concerning geometric introduction of quaterniona q spinors bq numbers a subset of hp numbers may be regarded unique since it comprises diverse representatives of associative algebras of good ones real complex and quaternion numbers as well as of not good ones admitting zero divisors bi quaternions double split complex and dual numbers 10 in particular one will see abiquaternion and quaternion algebras have the same set of units hence associated spinors so for simplicity further on the objects will be referred to only as q units and q spinors 1 http arxiv org abs 1202 2995 v 1 below that the hp unit of dual numbers despite the fact that it has zero norm is the most fundamental among all other units the real one included but a gen uine elementary object lying in the very basement of all units forming the named above algebras is a set of spinors or elements of ideals 11 that heuristically emerge as eigenfunctions of imaginary q units represented by square matrices 12 this way of introduction of the spinors suffers at least of two disadvantages first to hit the goal one has to use a definite representation of q units thus depriving the result of generality second the character of the q spinors as hidden basic elements of the q algebra having transparent geometric meaning 13 comes to light in solution of equations for eigenfunctions of an operator what in fact is an artificial math ematical act it seems logically sustainable to start vice versa from elementary geometric notions and objects arriving in result to composed objects describing other geometry this line is pursued in this study its result is an original model of nature of 3 d world dimensions in section 2 a geometric basement of the theory a 2 d surface locally described by a dyad two unitary and orthogonal vectors is introduced and all primitive direct products of the basic vectors nilpotent and idempotent objects are investigated section 3 contains a detailed study of algebraic properties of all possible linear com binations of the nilpotent and idempotent objects it is shown in section 4 that the four obtained new objects form a set of vector hp units in particular the set of q units what prompts to regard the initial surface 2 d sell as a fundamental struc tural element of a 3 d space dimension in section 5 the dyad vectors structuring the other dimensions of the space are found as functions of the initial 2 d sell ele ments and expressions for respective metric tensors are deduced an idea of world screen mathematically equivalent to a number of q frames particles in 3 d space is suggested in section 6 and samples of simple 2 d sells are considered giving birth to different q frames short discussion in section 7 concludes the study 2 tensor products of orthonormal vectors on a sur face consider a sufficiently smooth 2 d space surface endowed with a coordinate system xa x 1 x 2 and having a symmetric metric gab with its reciprocal existing gbc gabg bc ca a b c 1 2 c a is the symbol of kronecker summation over repeated indices is implied a square line element on the surface is ds

to eq 3 vanish gh gabhbc aaabbbbc 0 hg habgbc babbabac 0 12 i e these matrices are orthogonal thus tensor multiplication of the basic vectors on a 2 d surface yields four objects e f and g h summarize their algebraic properties the objects e f are non symmetric traceless 2 2 matrices with zero determinants they have zero squares hence norms thus belonging to the nilpotent set and their mutual left and right multiplication gives birth to a new couple g and h objects of mixed covariance each composed as a tensor product of same basic vector either a or b the objects g h are symmetric 2 2 matrices with unit trace and zero determinant their squares hence any natural power returns themselves thus referring the matrices to idempotent set and they are mutually orthogonal since their left and right products vanish one notes that the objects e and f possess properties characteristic to vector unit of the hp numbers subset dual hyperbolic numbers 10 among the four objects they should be considered more fundamental ones since they are used to compose idempotents not vice versa 3 simplest linear combinations of nilpotents and idem potents simplest linear combinations of the nilpotent couple e f

aaab b abb a b 1 18 therefore eq 15 written symbolically i 2 1 19 means that the object i ab can be thought of apart from a b as another type of real unit in the 2 2 matrix set the object 14 is a skew

gives an imaginary unit j the difference of idempotents 21 again gives a type of real unit k squares of these unit like objects are expressed through the real unit 1 given by the sum of idempotents 18 it is easily verified that products of 1 and any of the other unit like objects return this object e g k ab a bad b bbd a aab babb abad bbbd aaad babd k ad or symbolically k 1 k but multiplication of

as a set of some hypercomplex units and the table 23 may be regarded as a basis of a hypercomplex algebra but even with only real coefficients at the units this algebra would comprise zero divisors e g s 1 i s 2 s s 1 i 1 i 0 p i j p 2 p p i j i j 0 the number s belonging to the set of split complex double numbers the number p being a dual number 10 however one easily changes the non satisfactory set of units 1 i j k so that it becomes the basis of good quaternion algebra in fact only the objects with the tilde i k are to be converted from real like units into imaginary ones in the set of 2 2 matrices what is done with the help of the scalar imaginary unit i then the linear combinations of products of orthonormal vectors belonging to a 2 d surface give a set of quaternion units 1 ab aaab

vectors initiating a cartesian q frame in 3 d space each unit determining one dimension so eqs 25 reveal the non obvious fact that each dimension of the 3 d space physical space not excluded may be thought of having some fine structure the structural elements reflecting geometric properties of some two dimensional space surface this means that there is a clear functional interdependence between geometry of a surface and behavior of respective frame therefore each particular frame with an observer implied in its origin immanently has its elementary image represented by a couple of vectors forming a 2 d surface domain a 2 d sell 5 the metrics of 2 d sells associated with the q units the above study offers solution of direct problem of building a q frame from basic 2 d vectors procedure of the inverse problem solution of describing the 2 d sell on the base of properties of a given q frame is prompted by eqs 25 select e g eq 25 c with the identification q 3 kab and notice that this matrix has two eigenvectors ab bb and respective covectors aa ba with eigenvalues i kaba b i ab kabaa i ab k a bb b i bb kabba i bb 28 if the eigenfunctions are known then according to eqs 24 25 all other q units the scalar one included are straightforwardly constructed this moves out the eigenfunction problem for given q vector triad and makes it interesting to express eigenvectors belonging to other two q units 25 a and 25 b through vector and covector solutions of eqs 28 the procedure of finding the expressions is straight forward each eigenvector is assumed to be a linear combinations of the vectors ab bb the coefficients of the combination determined from respective eigenfunction equation in fact the solutions for the functions are found up to an arbitrary factor 7 a solution for eigenfunctions of the operator q 1 iab is with the free factor chosen a constant for i ca i 2 aa ba ca i 2 aa ba 29 a for i da 1 2 aa ba da 1 2 aa ba 29 b a solution for the operator q 2 jab is for i

unit i or the unit j e g i iac i cacb dadb j jac i eaeb fafb analysis of the quaternion multiplication table 26 27 shows 12 that the vector q units eigenfunctions ab bb and those given by eqs 29 has spinor properties since the multiplication table 26 or 27 remains invariant under transformations of the eigenfunctions by 2 2 matrices from special linear group sl 2 c according to results of the section 4 each q unit should have an associated 2 d sell with a metric constructed from the q unit s eigenfunctions find expression for all these metrics in the terms of the eigenfunctions and also in terms of the initially chosen spinors aa ba first find expression for metric g 3 ab of the 2 d sell associated with q 3 through its eigenfunctions aa ba the sought for expression immediately follows from eqs 18 or 25 a g 3 ab aaab babb 30 the orthonormality conditions 2 and 3 evidently fulfilled the formula for met ric g 1 ab associated with q 1 is given by analogous combination of the covector eigenfunctions ca db and with the help of eqs 29 a 29 b is expressed through aa ba g 1 ab cacb dadb aabb abba 31 one immediately notices that eq 31 is equivalent to eq 13 with its upper index lowered by metric 30 i e the metric of the 2 d sell belonging to unit q vector q 1 in terms of basic elements aa ba belonging to q 3 is perceived as the vector real unit i ab with all lower indices the metric associated with q 2 is found through its eigenfunctions and with the help of eqs 29 c 29 d through those belonging to q 3 as 8 g 2 ab eaeb fafb aaab bbba 32 i e in terms of aa ba this metric is perceived as vector real unit k ab with all lower indices eqs 31 32 to some extent reveal the geometric sense of the real vector units i k emerging in eqs 13 21 as simple linear combinations of nilpotents and idempotents if kronecker delta 18 is a natural metric of a 2 d sell the metric of the surface structuring a certain say basic space dimension then the units i andk are similar metrics of two other space dimensions but regarded from viewpoint of the basic dimensions 6 world screen technology and examples of q frames born by given 2 d sells a quaternion triad is known to be naturally associated with a frame of reference 8 providing exhaustive explanation of motion of an arbitrary particle but as is shown above such a frame has its more elementary image a 2 d sell formed by a couple of 2 d eigenvectors belonging to any of three unit q vectors therefore character istics of the particle motion are reflected by mathematical properties of the 2 d sell description let motion law of a certain number of particles be known then the chosen space domain with the particles in it can be adequately represented by a regular set of respective 2 d sells each sell describing behavior of one particle a collection of all such sells form a kind of screen containing full kinematical infor mation of the domain of 3 d world eqs 29 32 state that there are at least three options to construct the world screen using different sets of eigenfunctions how ever all linearly dependent detailed analysis of the 2 d sells reflecting properties of characteristic 3 d motions is to appear in following publications now stress that vice versa an arbitrary 2 d surface its sufficiently limited domain as well should generate a q frame some illustrative examples of q frames born by ordinary geometric surfaces are given below plane this trivial example details the procedure of constructing q frames from 2 d sells the cartesian metric of a plane assumed structuring the dimension q 3 is the kronecker delta g 3 ab a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 g ab 3 a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 in this case the basic vectors forming the 2 d sell are constant rows and columns plane spinors aa a 2 0 1 ba a 1 1 0 aa a 2 0 1 ba a 1 1

eqs 33 quaternion version of relativity theory 8 states that the units 34 describe a frame moving with constant velocityd v tanh in the positive sense of the direction q 2 and being observed from the immobile frame qk the time coordinate in this case changes along imaginary direction iq 1 i it is evident that a cylindrical surface with changing radius corresponds to a relativistic frame having rectilinear trajectory but variable velocity modulus sphere the spherical metric its reciprocal is a clear composition of the covectors vectors aa r sin a 2 ba r a 1 a a 1 r sin a 2 b a 1 r a 1 dfundamental velocity is chosen a unity 10 that due to eqs 25 give birth to the vector q units q 3 i 1 0 0 1 q 1 i 0 sin sin 1 0 q 2 i 0 i sin i sin 1 0 36 having in this case a singularity at the polar point to avoid infinities consider a domain close to the sphere s equator 2 1 so that sin cos 1 2 2 then one obtains a development of e g vector iq 1 of eqs 36 q 1 q 1 i 2 2 q 2 describing hyperbolic rotation of the frame 36 similar to that given by eq 35 but with small hyperbolic parameter 2 2 1 thus the spherical ring corresponds to a frame as in the previous case moving along q 2 relatively to qk but with variable velocity v tanh 2 2 other characteristic examples will be given elsewhere 7 discussion a somewhat prolonged and dull study undertaken in the first sections of this pa per of nilpotent and idempotent objects emerging upon 2 d surface geometry has nonetheless an exciting issue a set of strict mathematical correlations is obtained linking geometry of 2 d surface domains with functional dependence of 3 d hyper complex units existence of these math links on the one hand may correspond to presence of real space and time dimensions interior structure not detected in macroscopic experiments and since the basic vectors forming elementary 2 d sur faces behave like spinors this aspect of the study may lead to better understanding of essence of the quantum theory on the other hand the found correlations definitely open opportunity to replace description of quaternion triads successfully treated in physics as movable rigid frames of reference by description of respective 2 d sells geometry moreover it turns out that any q frame having a sense of an oriented particle body of reference can be adequately represented by at least three dif ferent 2 d sells each associated with a chosen space dimension this prompts to suggest an idea of mapping domains of 3 d space comprising a number of particles q frames onto a sufficiently wide world screen consisting of respective num ber of 2 d sells each sell represented by a somehow limited local spinor screen few given examples show that the idea of the screen is in principle realizable although a good deal of profound study remains yet undone so there is a space for explorations aiming to make this alluring technology work and as well be useful 11 references and notes 1 j p ward quaternions and cayley
