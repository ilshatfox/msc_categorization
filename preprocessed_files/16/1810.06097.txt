a partially ordered set hom r whose elements are all pairs a m where a ker and m 1 u s for some ring morphism of r into an arbitrary ring s here u s denotes the group of units of s the assignment r 7 hom r turns out to be a contravariant functor of the category ring of associative rings with identity to the category parord of partially ordered sets the maximal elements of hom r constitute a subset max r which for commutative rings r can be identified with the zariski spectrum spec r of r every pair a m in hom r has a canonical representative that is there is a universal ring morphism r s r a m a corresponding to the pair a m where the ring s r a m a is constructed as a universal inverting r a ring in the sense of cohn several properties of the sets hom r and max r are studied 1 introduction in this paper we study a contravariant functor hom ring parord from the category ring of all associative rings with identity to the category parord of partially ordered sets this functor associates to every ring r the set of all pairs a m where a ker and m 1 u s for some ring morphism r s here s is any other ring that is any object ofring and u s denotes the group of units invertible elements of s with respect to a suitable partial order the set hom r turns out to be a meet semilattice lemma 2 6 the idea is to measure and classify via the study of the partially ordered set hom r all ring morphisms from the fixed ring r to any other ring s we have at least five motivations to study our functor hom 1 we want to generalize the theory developed by bavula for left ore localiza tions 3 4 5 to arbitrary ring morphisms in those papers bavula discovered the importance of maximal left denominator sets therefore here we want to extend his idea from ring morphisms r s 1 r that arise as left ore localizations to ar bitrary ring morphisms r s in view of bavula s results we pay a particular attention to the maximal elements of the partially ordered set hom r for every ring r the subset max r of all maximal elements of hom r is always non empty theorem 5 6 2 for a commutative ring r the set max r is in one to one correspondence with the zarisky spectrum spec r of r proposition 5 3 thus

a possibly non commutative ring r unluckily the assignment r 7 max r is not a contravariant functor theorem 5 7 this is not quite surprising because in the commutative case the maximal spectrum i e the topological subspace of spec r whose elements are all maximal ideals of the commutative ring r is not a functor either all this is related to the paper 21 by manuel reyes notice that the category parord of partially ordered sets is isomorphic to the category of all alexandrov t 0 spaces which is a full subcategory of the category top of topological spaces thus our contravariant functor hom can be also viewed as a functor of ring into top 3 the hom of a direct limit of rings ri is the inverse limit of the corresponding partially ordered sets hom ri theorem 4 1 we are motivated to the study of the good behavior of our functor hom with respect to direct limits of rings because spectra of commutative monoids has a similar behavior 20 corollary 2 2 notice that reyes universal contravariant functor p spec ring set can be defined as the inverse limit of the spectra of the commutative subrings of r 21 proposition 2 14 4 an approach similar to ours appears in the paper 24 by vale he also considers a contravariant functor from the category ring but to the category of ringed spaces when the ring r is commutative he also gets a sort of completion of spec r 5 finally the partially ordered set hom r always has a least element the pair 0 u r which corresponds to the identity morphism r r more generally like in bavula s case the set hom r has a natural partition into subsets hom r a section 2 the least elements of these subsets hom r a with a contained in the jacobson radical j r of r correspond to local morphisms proposition 7 6 that is to the ring morphisms r s such that for every r r r invertible in s implies r invertible in r thus our interest in the functor hom is also motivated by the several applications of local morphisms 9 12 notice that the subset hom r 0 classifies all ring extensions r s every pair a m in hom r has a canonical representative that is a universal ring morphism r s r a m a corresponding to the pair a m theorem 3 3 the ring s r a m a is constructed as a universal inverting r a ring in the sense of cohn 10 any other ring morphism r s corresponding to a m has a canonical factorization through theorem 7 3 one of the mappings appearing in this factorization of is a ring epimorphism t r t which still corresponds to the pair a m ring epimorphisms that is epimorphisms in the category ring currently play a predominant role in homological algebra 1 6 14 15 16 in particular left flat morphism that is when the codomain is a flat left r module the functor hom is not representable section 2 the meet semilattice hom r has a smallest element 0 u r but does not have a greatest element in general hence for some results instead of hom r it is more convenient to enlarge the partially ordered set hom r adjoining to it a further element a new greatest element 1 setting hom r hom r 1 in some sense this new greatest element 1 corresponds to the zero morphism r s for any ring s this enlarged partially ordered set hom r is a bounded lattice theorem 6 3 finally we specialize some of our results to bavula s case of left ring of fractions in bavula s case the ring morphism r s is the canonical mapping of r into on a partially ordered set associated to ring morphisms 3 the right ring of fractions s of r with respect to some right denominator set such a is clearly a ring epimorphism throughout all rings are associative with identity 1 6 0 and all ring morphisms send 1 to 1 the group of right and left invertible elements of r will be denoted by u r and the jacobson radical of r will be denoted by j r 2 the partially ordered set hom r let r be a ring we associate to each ring morphism r s into any other ring s the pair a m where a ker is the kernel of and m 1 u s is the inverse image of the group of units u s of s in the next lemmas we collect the basic properties of these pairs a m recall that a monoid s is cancellative if for every x y z s xz yz implies x y and zx zy implies x y an element x of a ring r is regular if for all r r rx 0 implies r 0 and xr 0 implies r 0 lemma 2 1 let r s be a ring morphism and a m its associated pair then 1 m is a submonoid of the multiplicative monoid r 2 u r m 3 m m a m a j r and a m 4 m a m a m m consists of regular elements of r a in particu lar m a is a cancellative submonoid of the multiplicative monoid r a proof 1 2 and 4 are easy 3 the inclusionsm m a m a j r are trivial in order to prove that m a j r m notice that m a m and 1 j r u r m since m is multiplicatively closed and contains 1 r it follows thatm m a 1 j r m a mj r aj r m a 1 rj r m a j r remark 2 2 the monoidm is not cancellative in general as an example consider r z 6 z s z 2 z z 6 z z 2 z the canonical projection x 1 6 z and y z 3 6 z then x y z m and xz yz but x 6 y recall that a multiplicatively closed subset m of a ring r is saturated if for every x y r xy m implies x m and y m a ring r is directly finite if for every x y r xy 1 implies yx 1 lemma 2 3 let r s be a ring morphism and a m its associated pair then 1 if s is a not necessarily commutative integral domain then the ideal a is completely prime 2 if s is a division ring then r is the disjoint union of a and m i e a m is a partition of the set r 3 if s is a directly finite ring e g if s is an integral domain then m is a saturated multiplicatively closed subset of r proof 3 suppose s directly finite x y r and xy m 1 u s then x y xy u s hence there exists s s such that x y s 1 and s x y 1 thus x is right invertible and y is left invertible since s is directly finite we have that x and y are both invertible in s so that x m and y m 4 alberto facchini and leila heidari zadeh notice that every integral domain is directly finite because if x y are element of an integral domain s and xy 1 then yxy y so yx 1 y 0 hence yx 1 we will now deal with preorders on a set x that is reflexive and transitive relations on x recall that if x is a set or more generally a class and is a preorder on x then it is possible to associate to an equivalence relation on x and a partial order on the quotient set x the equivalence relation on x is defined for every x y x by x y if x y and y x the partial order on the quotient set x x x x is defined by x y if x y on the class h r of all morphisms r s of r into arbitrary rings s there are two natural preorders if r s r s are two ring morphisms we have a first preorder on h r defined setting if ker ker and 1 u s 1 u s a second preorder on h r is defined setting if there exists a ring morphism s s such that correspondingly there is a first equivalence relation on the classh r defined for all ring morphisms r s r s with associated pairs a m a m respectively by if a m a m that is if and only if ker ker and 1 u s 1 u s let hom r h r denote the set class of all equivalence classes modulo that is equivalently the set of all pairs ker 1 u s the partial order on hom r h r associated to the preorder on h r is defined by setting a m a m if a a and m m as far as the second natural preorder on h r is concerned the equivalence relation on h r associated to is defined for every r s r s in h r by if there exist ring morphisms s s and s s such that and the partial order on the quotient class h r associated to the preorder on h r is defined by setting if remark 2 4 if there exists a ring morphism s s such that then a m a m equivalently for all r s r s in h r implies thus for all r s r s in h r implies a m a m i e equivalently the identity mapping h r h r is a preorder morphism of h r onto h r similarly there is an induced surjective morphism of factor classes h r h r hom r 7 the implication implies cannot be reversed in general that is there are morphisms r s and r s with a m a m but for which there does not exist a ring morphism s s with for instance let k be a finite field k its algebraic closure m 2 k the ring of 2 2 matrices with entries in k and k k and k m 2 k the canonical embeddings then k and m 2 k are simple rings so that all ring morphisms k m 2 k are injective but k is finite and k is infinite so that there is no ring morphism k m 2 k the implication implies a m a m can be reversed in some special cases for instance when we restrict our attention to localizations at left denominator sets see remark 7 5 on a partially ordered set associated to ring morphisms 5 proposition 2 5 let ring be the category of rings with identity and parord the category of partially ordered sets then hom ring parord is a con travariant functor proof the functor hom assigns to each ring r the set hom r of all pairs a m where a ker and m 1 u s for some ring morphism r s partially ordered by where a m b n if a b and m n moreover it assigns to each ring morphism f r r the increasing mapping hom f hom r hom r a m hom r 7 f 1 a f 1 m notice that if r s is a ring morphism a ker and m 1 u s then f r s is a ring morphism f 1 a ker f and f 1 m f 1 u s the functor hom is not representable namely suppose the contravariant hom ring set representable i e that there exists a ring a with hom naturally isomorphic to the contravariant functor homring a ring set now for every ring a there always exists a ringr with homring r a if a has characteristic 0 take for r any ring of characteristic 6 0 if a has characteristic n 2 take for r any ring of characteristic p prime with p 6 n our functor hom is such that hom r 6 for every ring r hence the functors hom and homring a can never be isomorphic for any fixed proper ideal a of r set hom r a ker 1 u s r s ker a clearly hom r is the disjoint union of the sets hom r a hom r a r hom r a in particular the partial order on hom r induces a partial order on each subset hom r a the following lemma has an easy proof lemma 2 6 let a m a m be the elements of hom r corresponding to two morphisms r s and r s then the element of hom r corresponding to the product morphism r s s is a a m m as a consequence the partially ordered set hom r turns out to be a meet semilattice in particular with respect to the operation hom r is a commuta tive semigroup in which every element is idempotent and which has a zero element the least element 0 u r of hom r which corresponds to the identity mor phism r r we will see in theorem 5 6 that the partially ordered set hom r always has maximal elements but does not have a greatest element in general so the semigroup hom r does not have an identity in general 6 alberto facchini and leila heidari zadeh 3 a universal construction let r be any ring and n be any fixed subset of r let x xn n n be a set of non commuting indeterminates in one to one correspondence with the set n let r x be the free r ring over x 7 and 22 example 1 9 20 on page 124 then there are a canonical ring morphism r r x and a mapping x r x such that for every ring s every ring morphism r s and every mapping x s there is a unique ring morphism r x s such that and let i be the two sided ideal of r x generated by the subset xnn 1 n n nxn 1 n n and s r n r x i clearly i could be the improper ideal of r x and s r n could be the zero ring there is a canonical mapping r n r s r n composite mapping of r r x and the canonical projection r x r x i the r ring r x i is the universal n inverting r ring in the sense of 10 proposition 1 3 1 lemma 3 1 if 0 m hom r for a ring r then the canonical ring morphism r m r s r m is injective and 1 r m u s r m m proof if 0 m hom r there are a ring s and ring morphism f r s such that 0 m is associated to f in particular f is an injective mapping the morphism f clearly factors through r m that is there is a ring morphism g s r m s with g r m f as f is injective r m is also injective moreover g r m f implies that m f 1 u s 1 r m u s r m finally the elements of m are clearly mapped to invertible elements of s r m via r m by construction and so 1 r m u s r m m the proof of the following lemma is immediate lemma 3 2 if a m hom r then a a m a hom r a theorem 3 3 let r be a ring and a m be an element of hom r then s r a m a is a non zero ring and if r s r a m a denotes the composite map ping of the canonical projection r r a and r a m a r a s r a m a then ker a and 1 u s r a m a m moreover for any ring morphism f r s such that ker f a and f 1 u s m there is a unique ring morphism g s r a m a s such that g f proof since a m hom r there are ring morphisms r s such that ker a and 1 u s m more generally let f r s be any ring morphism with ker f a and f 1 u s m then f factors as the composite mapping of the canonical projection r r a and a unique morphism f r a s now construct the ring s r a m a r a x i where x xm m m a by the universal property of the free r a ring r a x there is a unique ring morphism f r a x s such that f f and f where r a r a x and x r a x are the canonical mapping and x s is defined by xm f m 1 for every m m a see the diagram below from f f we get that f m f m f m and from f we have that f xm f xm m f m 1 f m 1 thus the generators xmm 1 andmxm 1 of the two sided ideal i of r a x are mapped to zero via f so that f factors in a unique way through a ring morphism g s r a m a r a x i on a partially ordered set associated to ring morphisms 7 s that is f g where r a x r a x i s r a m a denotes the canonical projection this applied to any ring morphisms r s such that ker a and 1 u s m shows that s r a m a is a non zero ring moreover set r a m a and f f f g then f g this proves the existence of g in the last part of the statement of the theorem r f s r a f 99 ttttttttttt r a x f oo s r a m a g gg now we apply again the previous results to any ring morphism r s since a a m a hom r a by lemma 3 2 we now have that r a m a r a s r a m a is an injective mapping by lemma 3 1 thus the kernel ker of r a m a is equal to ker a also 1 u s r a m a 1 u s r a m a r a m a 1 u s r a m a 1 1 r a m a u s r a m a 1 m a m it remains to prove the uniqueness of g that is if g s r a m a s is another ring morphism such that g f then g g now s r a m a is generated as a ring by the image of r via and the inverses of the elements of m since g g both mappings g and g send each r to f r and each m 1 to f m 1 it follows that g g as desired theorem 3 3 shows that for any pair a m in hom r there is a canonical ring morphism r s r a m a that realizes that pair moreover the universal property described in the last part of the statement of the theorem shows that the canonical morphism r s r a m a is one of the least elements in the class h r a of all morphisms f r s such that a ker f andm f 1 u s with respect to the preorder in the sense that f for every morphism f r s with a ker f and m f 1 u s 4 direct limits now let ri i i be a direct system of rings indexed on a directed set i hence for every i j i i j we have compatible connecting ring morphisms ij ri rj applying our functor hom we get an inverse system hom ri i i of partially ordered sets with connecting partially ordered set morphisms hom ij hom rj hom ri theorem 4 1 hom lim ri lim hom ri 8 alberto facchini and leila heidari zadeh proof let j rj lim ri be the canonical ring morphisms for every j i these morphisms induce partially ordered set morphisms hom j hom lim ri hom rj let h lim hom ri j i hom rj be the inverse limit of the inverse system hom ri i i of partially ordered sets and hj h hom rj the canonical map ping by the universal property of inverse limit there exists a unique partially order set morphism hom lim ri h such that hj hom j for every j i thus a m 1 i a 1 i m i i we will show that is a bijection and 1 is a morphism of partially order sets first we prove that the mapping is injective let a m a m be two elements of hom lim ri with a m a m then 1 j a 1 j m 1 j a 1 j m for every j i we claim that for any two subset x and y of lim ri if 1 j x 1 j y for every j i then x y if we prove the claim then 1 j a 1 j m 1 j a 1 j m for every j i implies a m a m which proves that is injective in order to prove the claim assume x y lim ri and 1 j x 1 j y for all j i if x x then there exists i j and ri ri with i ri x hence ri 1 i x 1 i y so that x i ri y thus x y similarly y x this concludes the proof of the claim which shows that is injective let us prove that is surjective let ai mi i i be an element of h so that 1 ij aj 1 ij mj ai mi for every i j in i here ai mi is an element of hom ri so that ai mi corresponds to the ring morphism i ri s ri ai mi ai theorem 3 3 we now show that s ri ai mi ai i i with suitable canonical connecting maps form a direct system of rings since 1 ij aj ai the morphisms ij induce monomorphisms ij ri ai rj aj and ij mi ai mj aj thus ij extends to a ring monomorphism ri ai xm ai m mi rj aj xm aj m mj that maps xm ai to x ij m aj these canonical ring monomorphisms induce ring morphisms ij s ri ai mi ai s rj aj mj aj for all i j the diagrams ri i ij s ri ai mi ai ij rj j s rj aj mj aj clearly commute for every i j hence we have a morphism of direct systems of rings and taking the direct limit we get a ring morphism lim ri lim s ri ai mi ai let a m hom lim ri be the pair corresponding to this ring morphism we claim that a m ai mi i i that is the 1 i a ai and 1 i m mi for each i i let us prove that 1 i a ai on a partially ordered set associated to ring morphisms 9 an element ri ri belongs to 1 i a if and only if i ri a ker that is if and only if i ri 0 now we have commutative diagrams ri i i s ri ai mi ai i lim ri lim s ri ai mi ai so that i ri 0 if and only if i i ri 0 which occurs if and only if there exists j i such that ij i ri 0 that is j ij ri 0 i e if and only if there exists j i such that ij ri aj equivalently if and only if ri ai this proves that 1 i a ai for every i we will now prove that 1 i m mi set s lim s ri ai mi ai an ele ment ri ri belongs to 1 i m if and only if i ri m that is if and only if i ri u s i e if and only if i i ri u s this occurs if and only if there exists s s such that s i i ri 1 and i i ri s 1 now any ele ment s of s is of the form j sj for some j i and sj s rj aj mj aj also j sj i i ri 1 and i i ri j sj 1 in s if and only if there exists k i j such that jk sj ik i ri 1 and ik i ri jk sj 1 in s rk ak mk ak this occurs if and only if ik i ri is invertible in s rk ak mk ak that is if and only if k ik ri is invertible in s rk ak mk ak i e ik ri mk that is ri 1 ik mk mi this shows that 1 i m mi and concludes the proof of the claim thus is surjective finally let us prove that 1 is a morphism of partially order sets let ai mi i i a i m i i i be two elements in h with ai mi i i a i m i i i that is with ai a i and mi m i for every i i we have direct systems of rings s ri ai mi ai i i and s r i a i m i a i i i and canonical projections i ri ai r i a i which extend to the free r ai ring r ai xmi ai to the free r a i ring r a i xm i a i sending each indeterminate xm a xmi ai to the in determinate xm a i xm i a i in this way we get a canonical ring morphism r ai xmi ai r a i xm i a i which induces factoring out the corresponding ideals ii and i i a ring morphism s r ai m ai s r a i m i a i and commutative squares ri i ri i s ri ai mi ai i s ri a i m i a i taking the direct limit we get a commutative triangle lim ri s s thus we have with respect to the preorder on h r so that a m a m 10 alberto facchini and leila heidari zadeh for the last paragraph of this section we have been inspired by 24 any preordered set x can be viewed as a category whose objects are the elements of x and for every pair x y x of objects of the category there is exactly one morphism x y if x y and no morphism x y otherwise this applies in particular to our partially ordered set hom r for any ring r there is a covariant functor fr hom r ring it associates to any object a m of hom r the ring s r a m a like in the proof of the previous theorem where we show that 1 is a partially ordered set morphism we have that if a m a m then there is a canonical morphism s r a m a s r a m a so we have for every ring r a covariant functor fr hom r ring this can be expressed by means of diagrams in the category ring formally a diagram of shape j in a category c is a functor f from j to c here we are considering only the case in which the category j is a partially ordered set thus we have for every ring r a diagram of shape hom r in the category ring 5 maximal elements in hom r we now recall a classification due to bokut see 8 and 11 pp 515 516 let d 0 be the class of integral domains d 2 the class of invertible rings that is rings r such that the universal mapping inverting all non zero elements of r is injective and e be the class of rings embeddable in division rings then d 0 d 2 e notice that a ring r d 0 is in d 2 if and only if the mapping r r 0 r s r r 0 is injective if and only if 0 r 0 hom r proposition 5 1 let a be an ideal of a ring r such that a r a hom r then a is a completely prime ideal of r the ring r a is invertible and a r a hom r is a maximal element of hom r proof since a r a hom r the set r a is multiplicatively closed that is a is completely prime moreover a r a hom r implies that there exists a morphism r s with kernel a for which all elements of r a are invertible the induced mapping r a s is an injective morphisms for which the image of every non zero element of r a is invertible in s the injective morphism factors through the universal inverting mapping r a s r a m a by theorem 3 3 thus injective implies injective i e r a is an invertible ring finally a r a is a maximal element of hom r because if a r a a m then a a and r a m hence a m implies a a and m r a in the following example we show that not all maximal elements of hom r are of the form a r a for some completely prime ideal a example 5 2 let r be the ring of n n matrices with entries in a division ring d n 1 then any homomorphism r s s any ring is injective because r is simple every element of m 1 u s is regular by lemma 2 1 but regular elements in r are invertible this proves that hom r has exactly one element the pair 0 u r thus clearly hom r has a greatest element which is not of the form a r a because r is simple but not a domain and r has no completely prime ideals proposition 5 3 for any commutative ring r the maximal elements of hom r are the pairs p r p where p is a prime ideal on a partially ordered set associated to ring morphisms 11 proof by proposition 5 1 the pairs p r p where p is any prime ideal of the commutative ring r are maximal elements of hom r conversely let a m hom r be a maximal element the set f of all ideals b of r with a b and b m is non empty because a f by zorn s lemma the set f partially ordered by set inclusion has a maximal element p it is very easy to check that p is a prime ideal of r then a m p r p but a m is maximal so a m p r p proposition 5 4 let r be a commutative ring then hom r has a greatest element if and only if r has a unique prime ideal proof if hom r has a greatest element a m then a m is the unique maximal element of hom r so that r has a unique prime ideal by proposition 5 3 conversely let r be a commutative ring with a unique prime ideal p then r is a local ring with maximal ideal p clearly the pair p r p belongs to hom r because it is associated to the canonical morphism of r onto the field r p for any other ring morphism r s one has ker p because ker is a proper ideal of r in order to show that p r p is the greatest element of hom r it suffices to show that 1 u s r p we claim that 1 u s which is clearly a multiplicatively closed subset of r is saturated that is if r r r and rr u s then r u s this is sufficient because r is commutative if r r r and rr u s then there exists s s such that r r s 1 thus r is invertible in s this proves the claim the complement of a saturated multiplicatively closed subset of a commutative ring is a union of prime ideals 2 p 44 exercise 7 since r has a unique prime ideal the saturated multiplicatively closed subsets of r are only r p the improper subset r of r and the empty set it follows that 1 u s r p this concludes the proof example 5 5 as an example we now describe the structure of the partially ordered set hom z where z is the ring of integers for an arbitrary element a m of hom z we have that a nz for some non negative integer n 6 1 for n 0 the set m must be a saturated subset of z hence z m is a union of prime ideals 2 p 44 exercise 7 thus there exists a subset p of the set p p p is prime number such that m is the set mp of all z z z 6 0 with p z for every p p for any such subset p of p the pair 0 mp corresponds to the embedding of z into its ring of fractions with denominators in the multiplicatively closed subset mp of z now assume that a nz for some n 2 and that a m corresponds to some ring morphism z s then induces an injective ring morphism z nz s and m nz is a multiplicatively closed subset of z nz that consists of regular elements and contains u z nz since in a finite ring all regular elements are invertible it follows thatm nz u z nz so thatm mdiv n where div n p p p n thus hom z 0 mp p is a subset of p nz mdiv n n z n 2 notice that for any p p p and n n 2 1 0 mp 0 mp if and only if mp mp if and only if p p 2 nz mdiv n n z mdiv n if and only if nz n z if and only if n n because n n implies div n div n from which mdiv n mdiv n 3 0 mp nz mdiv n if and only if div n p 12 alberto facchini and leila heidari zadeh 4 nz mdiv n 0 mp never occurs in order to better describe the partially ordered set hom z we will now present an order reversing injective mapping hom z n 0 p where n 0 denotes the set of non negative integers with its usual order n 0 n 0 with n for all n n 0 p p 0 and the order on the product n 0 p is the component wise order via this the partially ordered set hom z can be identified as a partially ordered subset of the opposite partially ordered set of n 0 p notice that every positive integer n can be written uniquely as a product of primes n pe 11 p nt t for suitable distinct primes pi p and positive integers ei so that there is an order preserving injective mapping n np 0 where the set n of positive integers is ordered by the relation divides here n p ei if p pi for some i 0 if p p p 1 pt for every n n and p p similarly there are characteristic functions of subsets p of p so that there is an order preserving bijection p p 0 p defined by p p for every p in the power set p p of all subsets of p where p p 0 is such that p p if p p 0 if p p p for every p p and p p our mapping will extend both the order preserving injective mapping and the order isomorphism define hom z n 0 p by nz mdiv n p ei if p pi for some i 0 if p p p 1 pt 0 if p 0 for every n 2 and p p p 0 and 0 mp p if p p 0 if p p p 1 if p 0 for every p p in order to show that this mapping is an order reversing embedding of hom z into n 0 p we must prove that satisfies the following four properties correspond ing to the four properties 1 4 above 1 0 mp p 0 mp p for every p p if and only if p p 2 n z mdiv n p nz mdiv n p for every p p if and only if n n 3 nz mdiv n p 0 mp p for every p p if and only if div n p 4 for every p p and every n 2 there exists p p such that nz mdiv n p 0 mp p let p p be subsets of p in order to prove 1 notice that 0 mp p 0 mp p for every p p if and only if for every p p 0 mp p implies 0 mp p this is equivalent to p p implies p p for every p p that is if and only if p p now let n n 2 be integers then n z mdiv n p nz mdiv n p for every p p if and only if for every prime p p n implies p n and the exponent of on a partially ordered set associated to ring morphisms 13 p in a prime factorization of n is less than or equal to the exponent of p in a prime factorization of n this is equivalent to n n which proves 2 for 3 let n pe 11 p et t be a prime factorization of the integer n 2 then nz mdiv n p 0 mp p for every p p if and only if nz mdiv n p 0 mp p for every p p if and only if nz mdiv n pi 0 mp pi for every i 1 2 t if and only if ei 0 mp pi for every i 1 2 t that is if and only if div n p finally 4 is trivial because it suffices to take p 0 it easily follows that 1 hom z has 0 mp 0 1 1 0 u z as its least element and 2 the maximal elements of hom z are the pairs 0 m 0 z 0 and the pairs pz mdiv p pz z pz for every p p cf proposi tion 5 3 propositions 5 1 and 5 3 show that the set max r of all maximal elements of hom r could be used as a good substitute for the spectrum of a non commutative ring r let us show that the set of all maximal elements is never empty theorem 5 6 for every ring r the partially ordered set hom r has maximal elements proof let r be a ring it is known that r always has maximal two sided ideals that is maximal elements in the set of all proper two sided ideals this is a very standard application of zorn s lemma let m be a maximal two sided ideal of r set f m m 1 u s s is any ring and r s is a ring morphism with ker m then f is non empty consider the canonical projection r r m partially order f by set inclusion let m be a chain in f by theorem 3 3 m 1 u s r m m m where r s r m m m is the canonical mapping since the monoids m are linearly ordered by set inclusion the rings s r m m m form a direct system of rings over a linearly ordered set and there is a ring morphism lim r s lim s r m m m the elements of m are mapped to invertible elements of s via so that they are mapped to invertible elements of s via thus 1 u s m i e 1 u s f is an upper bound of the chain of the monoids m hence we can apply zorn s lemma which concludes the proof of the theorem from proposition 2 5 theorem 5 6 and 21 theorem 1 1 we get that theorem 5 7 there is no contravariant functor from the category of rings to the category of sets that assigns to each ring r the set of all maximal elements of hom r it would be very interesting to determine for any ring r if the set hom r 0 has a greatest element this would correspond with what has been done by bavula for left localizations at left ore sets in 4 theorem 2 1 2 the greatest element of hom r 0 corresponds to a suitable submonoid m of the multiplicative monoid regr of all regular elements of r notice that 1 when r is commutative the greatest element of hom r 0 is clearly 0 regr 2 more generally if regr is a right ore set or a left ore set then the greatest element of hom r 0 is 0 regr 14 alberto facchini and leila heidari zadeh 3 if the ring r is contained in a division ring the greatest element of hom r 0 is 0 r 0 4 more generally suppose that the canonical morphism r regr r s r regr is injective or equivalently r is contained in a ring in which all regular elements of r are invertible for example r could be an invertible ring see the definition in the first paragraph of this section then the greatest element of hom r 0 is 0 regr 5 ifm is a submonoid ofr the pair 0 m is a maximal element of hom r 0 if and only if the canonical morphism r m r s r m is injective and for every regular element x r x m the canonical mapping r m x r s r m x is not injective remark 5 8 for any ring r consider the three sets div r a r a a ker for a morphism r d into some division ring d cpr r p r p hom r p is a completely prime ideal of r max r of all maximal elements of hom r in general we have div r cpr r max r hom r proposition 5 1 and all these inclusions can be proper when r is commutative div r cpr r max r spec r hom r proposition 5 3 related to this we can consider cohn s spectrum x r of the ring r that is the topological space x r of all epic r fields up to isomorphism recall that a ring morphism f r d is an epic r field in the sense of 10 p 154 if d is a division ring and there is no division ring different from d between f r and d notice that there are rings r for which there is no epic r field r d for instance if r is a ring that is not ibn there is no ring morphism r d for any division ring d clearly there is an onto mapping x r div r 6 the partially ordered set hom r as we have said in section 2 the partially ordered set hom r is a meet semilattice hence a commutative semigroup in which every element is idempotent has a smallest element 0 u r but does not have a greatest element in general hence we now enlarge the partially ordered set hom r adjoining to it a further ele ment a new greatest element 1 setting hom r hom r 1 here a m 1 for every element a m hom r this new element 1 of hom r represents in some sense the zero morphism r 0 where 0 is the zero ring with one element the zero ring is not a ring in our sense strictly because we have supposed in the introduction that all our rings have an identity 1 6 0 this is the reason why the zero morphism r 0 does not appear in the definition of hom r moreover the pair a m corresponding to the zero morphism r 0 would clearly have a r but it is not clear what m should be the contravariant functor hom ring parord extends to a contravari ant functor hom ring parord simply extending for every ring mor phism r s the mapping hom hom s hom r to the mapping hom hom s hom r where hom 1 1 first of all we will now show that hom r 1 r 2 where r 1 r 2 denotes the ring direct product is canonically isomorphic to the cartesian product hom r 1 on a partially ordered set associated to ring morphisms 15 hom r 2 we first need an elementary proposition for every pair r s of rings we will denote the set of all ring morphisms r s including the zero morphism r 0 by homring r s proposition 6 1 let r 1 r 2 s be rings then there is a bijection between homring r 1 r 2 s and the set of all triples e 1 2 where e s is an idempotent element and 1 r 1 ese 2 r 2 1 e s 1 e are ring morphisms possibly zero when e 0 or e 1 proof let t denote the set of all the triples e 1 2 in the statement let homring r 1 r 2 s t be defined by 1 r 1 0 r 2 r 1 r 2 here r 1 r 2 s is any ring morphism so that e 1 r 1 0 r 2 is an idem potent element of s and r 1 r 1 ese r 2 r 2 1 e s 1 e denote the restrictions of to r 1 r 2 respectively or more precisely to the subsets r 1 0 and 0 r 2 of r 1 r 2 we leave to the reader to check that is a well defined surjective mapping as far as injectivity is concerned notice that if r 1 r 2 s and r 1 r 2 s are ring morphisms and then because r 1 r 2 is the direct sum of r 1 and r 2 as additive abelian groups and therefore are completely determined by their restrictions to the direct summands r 1 and r 2 of r 1 r 2 proposition 6 2 let r 1 and r 2 be rings then there is a canonical bijection between hom r 1 r 2 and the cartesian product hom r 1 hom r 2 proof first of all we show that for any ring morphism r 1 r 2 s we have 1 ker ker r 1 ker r 2 and 2 1 u s r 1 1 u ese r 2 1 u 1 e s 1 e here like in the proof of proposition 6 1 e is the image via of the idempotent element 1 r 1 0 r 2 of r 1 r 2 and r 1 r 1 ese r 2 r 2 1 e s 1 e are the restrictions of to r 1 r 2 we leave the easy proof of 1 to the reader as far as 2 is concerned notice that this formula makes no sense when one of the morphisms r 1 or r 2 is zero in these three cases either e 0 or e 1 and the morphisms r 1 r 2 correspond to the greatest element 1 of hom r 1 r 2 hom r 1 or hom r 2 respectively also remark that if r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 then r 1 r 2 1 u s if and only if r 1 r 2 u s now r 1 r 2 ese 1 e s 1 e is invertible in s if and only if it is invertible in ese 1 e s 1 e that is if and only if r 1 r 1 is invertible in ese and r 2 r 2 is invertible in 1 e s 1 e this concludes the proof of 2 from 1 and 2 it follows that the mapping hom r 1 r 2 hom r 1 hom r 2 ker 1 u s 7 ker r 1 r 1 1 u ese ker r 2 r 2 1 u 1 e s 1 e is a well defined injective mapping its surjectivity is proved considering for any pair of ring morphisms 1 r 1 s 1 2 r 2 s 2 the ring morphism 1 2 r 1 r 2 s 1 s 2 16 alberto facchini and leila heidari zadeh we saw in lemma 2 6 and the paragraph following it that the partially ordered set hom r is a meet semilattice so that hom r with respect to the operation is a commutative semigroup in which every element is idempotent now hom r is also a meet semilattice but with a greatest element 1 so hom r with respect to the operation turns out to be a commutative monoid in which every element is idempotent hence we can view the functor hom as a functor of ring into the category cmon of commutative monoids now commutative monoids have a spectrum set of its prime ideals i e there is a contravariant functor spec from the category cmon to the category top of topological spaces 20 for every commutative monoid a spec a is a spectral space in the sense of hochster hence the composite functor spec hom ring top associates to every ring a spectral topological space theorem 6 3 for every ring r the partially ordered set hom r is a bounded lattice proof it is clear that hom r is a partially ordered set with a least element 0 u r and a greatest element 1 since we already know that hom r is a meet semilattice we only have to show that any pair of elements a m a m of hom r has a least upper bound in hom r it is clear that the least upper bound exists when one of the two elements is the greatest element 1 of hom r suppose a m a m hom r let r s r a m a be the ring morphism corresponding to the pair a m as in the statement of theorem 3 3 similarly for r s r a m a let r p s r a m a r s r a m a be the pushout of and in ring and a m the element of hom r corresponding to we will now prove that a m a m a m in the partially ordered set hom r since factors through we have that a m a m similarly a m a m conversely let r t be any morphism with associated pair b n and with b n a m a m by the universal property of the orem 3 3 there is a unique ring morphism g s r a m a t such that g similarly there is a unique ring morphism g s r a m a t such that g by the universal property of pushout there exists a unique morphism h p t such that h g and h g where s r a m a p and s r a m a p are the canonical mappings into the pushout then h h g so factors through hence b n a m r s r a m a g s r a m a g p h t hence hom r with respect to the operation turns out to be a commutative monoid with zero the element 1 and identity the element 0 u r in which all elements are idempotent on a partially ordered set associated to ring morphisms 17 7 ring epimorphisms recall that a ring morphism r s is an epimorphism if for all ring mor phisms s t implies proposition 7 1 17 10 proposition 4 1 1 23 proposition xi 1 2 the fol lowing conditions on a ring morphism r s are equivalent a is an epimorphism b s 1 1 s in the s s bimodule s r s for all s s c the r r bimodule s r s is isomorphic to the r r bimodule s via the canonical isomorphism induced by the multiplication s s s of the ring r d the pushout r s r s of with itself is naturally isomorphic to r s e s r s r 0 proposition 7 2 let r s be a ring morphism and a m be its corre sponding pair in hom r let t be the subring of s generated by r and all the elements m 1 m m then the corestriction t r t is a ring epimorphism and its corresponding pair in hom r is a m proof let t be the subset of t consisting of all elements a t with a 1 1 a in the s s bimodule t r t the subset t of t is a subring of t that contains r because t r t is a t t bimodule in which multiplication by elements of t is defined by t t t tt t and t t t t t t so that a 1 1 a and b 1 1 b imply ab 1 a b 1 a 1 b a b a 1 b 1 a b 1 ab this shows that t is a subring of t moreover if m m then in t r t we have that m 1 1 m 1 m m 1 m 1 m m 1 1 m 1 it follows that t t hence t t it follows that the corestriction t r t is an epimorphism finally m 1 u s and m u t for every m m thus m 1 u t 1 u s m now consider the universal construction of theorem 3 3 let r s be a ring morphism and a m be its corresponding pair in hom r via the canonical ring morphism r s r a m a the subring t of s r a m a generated by r and the inverses of the images of the elements ofm is the whole ring s r a m a it follows that the canonical ring morphism r s r a m a is a ring epimorphism more generally for any ring morphism r s we have the canonical factor ization described in the next theorem theorem 7 3 let r s be any ring morphism and a m its corresponding element in hom r then is the composite ring morphism of the mappings r r a s r a m a g t s where t is the subring of s generated by r and the inverses m 1 of the images of the elements of m g s r a m a t is a surjective ring epimorphism and t s is the ring embedding this theorem shows that any ring morphisms r s can be factorized as 1 a canonical mapping r s r a m a which only depends on the pair a m hom r associated to 2 a ring morphism s r a m a t which is a surjective mapping and is an epimorphism in the category of rings 3 a ring embedding t s 18 alberto facchini and leila heidari zadeh proof apply the universal property of theorem 3 3 to the corestriction t r t getting a factorization r r a s r a m a g t of t the mapping g is surjective because t is generated by the images of the elements of r and the inverses of the elements of m like s r a m a moreover g is a ring epimorphism because t r t is a ring epimorphism by proposition 7 2 so g g implies g g i e t t from which for any other ring morphism f r s such that ker f a and f 1 u s m there is a unique ring morphism g s r a m a s such that g f it follows that the subring t of s generated by f r and the elements f m 1 is the image g s r a m a of s r a m a hence the corestriction f t r t is the composite mapping of r s r a m a and the corestriction g t s r a m a t recall that a subset t is a left ore subset of r if it is a submonoid of r such that tr rt 6 for every r r and t t a subset t of the ring r is called a left denominator set if it is a left ore subset and for every r r t t if rt 0 then there exists t t with t r 0 a left ring of fractions r t 1 r exists if and only if t is a left denominator set in r compare lemma 2 1 4 with the fact that a left quotient ring t 1 r of a ring r with respect to a multiplicatively closed subset t of r exists if and only if t is a left ore set and the set t t ass t r ass t t t consists of regular elements see 19 2 1 12 and 18 here ass t denotes the set of all elements r r for which there exists an element t t with tr 0 that is ass t is the kernel a of the canonical morphism r t 1 r lemma 7 4 let t be a left denominator set in r and r s t 1 r the canonical mapping into the left ring of fractions then m 1 u s is a left denominator set in r containing t a ass t ass m and s m 1 r proof it is well known that a ker ass t moreover m t let us prove that m is a left ore subset of r fix r r and m m we must show that mr rm 6 now r m 1 s t 1 r so that there exist r r and t t such that r m 1 t 1 r then t r r m in s so that there exists t t with rtt mr t rt mr rm mr t tr t r m tr rm mr rm this proves that m is a left ore subset of r in order to see that m is a left denominator set notice that if r r m m and rm 0 then r m 0 so r 0 hence r ker ass t so that tr 0 for some t t but t m this proves that m is a left denominator set it is now clear that s t 1 r m 1 r and thus a ker ass m clearly lemma 7 4 holds not only for left denominator sets and left rings of fractions but also for right denominator sets and right rings of fractions because associating the pair a m to a ring morphism is left right symmetric remark 7 5 we have already noticed in remark 2 4 that if there exists a ring morphism s s such that then a m a m this can be inverted for left localizations i e if s t 1 r and s t 1 r for suitable left denominator sets t t r s r s are the canonical mappings and a m a m then there exists a ring morphism s s such that on a partially ordered set associated to ring morphisms 19 to prove it suppose that s t 1 r and s t 1 r for left denominator sets t t that r s r s are the canonical mappings and a m a m since m m so t m m the elements of t are mapped to invertible elements of s m 1 r via the canonical mapping r s by the universal property of the mapping r s t 1 r there exists a unique ring morphism s s such that similarly for the equivalence relation if s t 1 r and s t 1 r for left denominator sets t t and r s r s are the canonical mappings then if and only if there exists a ring isomorphism s s such that finally we have already remarked in the introduction that a ring morphism r s is local if and only ifm u r moreover ker j r for every local morphism r s 13 lemma 3 1 it follows that local morphisms correspond to the least elements of hom r a with respect to the partial order more precisely proposition 7 6 let r s be a ring morphism and a m its corresponding pair in hom r then is a local morphism if and only if a m is the least element of hom r a for some ideal a j r proof suppose that a m is the least element of hom r a for some ideal a j r by proposition 7 7 the least element of hom r a is a 1 u r a where r r a is the canonical projection thus m 1 u r a let us prove that is local if r r and r is invertible in s then r m so that r 1 u r a hence r a is invertible in r a hence r j r is invertible in r j r so r is invertible in r as desired this proves that is a local morphism the inverse implication is trivial more generally for an arbitrary proper ideal a of r not necessarily contained in j r we have that proposition 7 7 for every proper ideal a of a ring r the partially ordered set hom r a always has a least element which is the pair a m corresponding to the canonical projection r r a that is the pair a m with m 1 u r a proof we must show that for every ring morphism r s with ker a we have 1 u r a 1 u s now given r s with ker a let r r a denote the canonical projection by the first isomorphism theorem for rings there exists a unique injective ring morphism r a s such that it is now easily checked that 1 u r a 1 u s we conclude the paper indicating a further possible generalization of our the results in this paper in remark 5 8 we have already mentioned cohn s spectrum x r of a ring r consisting of all epic r fields up to isomorphism p m cohn has shown that any epic r field r d is characterized up to isomorphism by the collection of square matrices with entries in r which are carried to singular matrices with entries in the division ring d he has also given the conditions under which a collection of square matrices over r is of this type calling such a collection a prime matrix ideal of r the natural ideal is therefore to refine the theory developed in the previous sections classifying all morphisms r s not only via our pairs a m where m is the set of all elements of r mapped to invertible 20 alberto facchini and leila heidari zadeh elements of r but also via the collection of all n m matrices with entries in r which are carried to invertible n m matrices with entries in the ring s references 1 l angeleri hu gel and j sa nchez tilting modules arising from ring epimorphisms algebr represent theor 14 2011 217 246 2
