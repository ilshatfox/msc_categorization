tors for appropriate bicharacters on a polynomial algebra in one indeterminate and for the coordinate algebra of quantum n space for n 3 in the former case a set of generators for the quantum differential operators was identified in work by the first author and t c mccune but it was not known whether the algebra is noe therian we answer this question affirmatively setting it in a more general context involving the behaviour noetherian condition un der localization at the powers of a single element in the latter case we determine the algebra of quantum differential operators as a skew group algebra of the group zn over a quantized weyl alge bra it follows from this description that this algebra is a simple right and left noetherian domain 1 introduction this paper brings together two approaches to algebras of quantum differential operators on the one hand there is the formal axiomatic approach of lunts and rosenberg 13 where a notion of quantum dif ferential operator is defined and one can then set out to identify the algebra of operators for familiar algebras and analyse their properties the definition of these quantum differential operators requires the base k algebra r to be graded for some abelian group and depends on the choice of a bicharacter k the first author and t c mccune have contributed to this theory through their identification of the quantum differential operators for appropriate bicharacters of the polynomial algebra k x in one variable 8 and the coordinate algebra of the quantum plane 9 a second approach is to study algebras that are either generated by particular operators of an intuitively quantum differential nature or are generalizations of familiar algebras of differen tial operators examples of the latter in the work of the second author date november 12 2018 2010 mathematics subject classification 16 p 40 13 n 10 16 s 32 key words and phrases noetherian rings quantum differential operators 1 http arxiv org abs 1612 00832 v 1 2 iyer and jordan are the quantized weyl algebras 10 arising from the quantum cal culus of maltsiniotis 14 and the algebras generated by two or more eulerian derivatives 11 quantized weyl algebras are iterated skew polynomial algebras over the field k making many of their properties transparent algebras constructed in this approach are often subalge bras of the more formal algebras of quantum differential operators of lunts and rosenberg and one can then ask how close the relationship is and whether known properties of the subalgebras can enhance the understanding of the full algebras the most substantial two projects in the paper are instances of this the algebra d of quantum differential operators on the polynomial algebra k x for a particular bicharacter depending on a parameter q was studied in 8 where a set of generators was identified together with relations satisfied by those generators and some structural properties the main question left open was whether d is noetherian and we here we shall answer this positively under reasonable conditions on the parameter q the algebra dx of quantum differential operators on the laurent polynomial algebra k x 1 is more accessible than d and is obtained from d by localizing at the powers of x which although x is not normal in d form a right and left ore set in particular dx is readily seen to be right and left noetherian this raises an interesting general problem namely given a domain a and an element a a such that the powers of a form a right and left ore set and the localization aa is noetherian to find conditions on a and a which guarantee that a itself is noetherian we make a contribution to this problem by showing that under conditions that although they appear strong are satisfied by d and x this is heavily dependent on the work of rogalski 17 in addition to the noetherian result we find a basis for d and a complete set of defining relations the approach here follows that used in 11 in the study of algebras generated by eulerian derivatives our second project concerns the identification of the algebra of quan tum differential operators for the coordinate algebra of quantum n space for n 3 and a natural bicharacter we shall see here that under reasonable conditions this algebra is a skew group algebra of the group zn over a quantized weyl algebra the approach here is first to identify quantum differential operators that generate a subal gebra that is isomorphic to such an algebra and then to show that this subalgebra is the full algebra of quantum differential operators many structural properties follow from this description in particular the algebra of quantum differential operators is a simple right and left noetherian domain noetherian algebras of quantum differential operators 3 other algebras for which we consider quantum differential operators are quantum tori the coordinate algebra of the quantum plane and the quantum exterior algebra operators related to quantum differen tial operators such as derivations skew derivations and generalized derivations on the algebras that we consider have been well studied see 1 2 3 4 16 and references therein the paper is arranged as follows the preliminaries of quantum dif ferential operators are explained in section 2 section 3 is concerned with quantum differential operators on polynomial algebras and lau rent polynomial algebras this section includes a summary of the re sults of 8 and our discussion of the noetherian problem discussed above in section 4 we consider quantum differential operators over the coordinate algebras of quantum n space and quantum tori we recall the results on the quantum plane from 9 and then study the case of the coordinate algebra of quantum n space concentrating on the case n 3 where there are distinct differences to the cases n 1 2 the short section 5 deals with the quantum experior algebra for which the algebra of quantum differential operators is the entire algebra of linear maps on the quantum exterior algebra acknowledgements we thank t c mccune for useful discussions the first author gratefully acknowledges support from the psc cuny grants award 65413 00 43 she

operators 13 throughout k will be a field of characteristic 0 and k will denote the multiplicative group k 0 let be an abelian group fix a bicharacter k let r be a graded k algebra and m a graded r bimodule let h r respectively h m denote the set of homogeneous elements of r respectively m let zq m denote the quantum center ofm defined as the k span of those elements m h m for which there exists d such that mr d dr rm for all r h r for each a define a grhomk m m defined by a m a dm m for m h m and extend a linearly from h m to m for m m and r r let m r a mr a r m using this notation zq m k span m h m a such that m r a 0 r r 4 iyer and jordan let mq 0 rzq m r for i 1 mq i denotes the r bimodule gener ated by the set k span m h m a such that m r a mq i 1 r r note mq 0 mq 1 and mq diff i 0 mq i when m grhomk r r we get the filtered algebra of quantum differential op erators dq r mq diff and the r bimodule of quantum differential operators of order i is diq r mq i for each r h r let r r grhomk r r be the left and right multiplication maps r s rs r s sr s r by the definition of quantum differential operators we have the algebra d 0 q r is generated by the set r s a r s r a where r s s r a r a r a and a r a r a for any algebra a and a group g acting on a the skew group algebra a g is the left free a module with basis g g g along with an associative multiplication defined by a 1 g 1 a 2 g 2 a 1 g 1 a 2 g 1 g 2 then d 0 q r is a homomorphic image of r z r r o where z r denotes the centre of r ro denotes the opposite algebra of r and the homomorphism is given by a bo 7 a b for i 1 each diq r is the r bimodule generated by the k span of the set homogeneous a such that r a d i 1 q r note that b r a b b r a b in particular a r a r a a hence each diq r is the d 0 q r bimodule generated by the k span of the set homogeneous r di 1 q r for each a let grhomk r r be a left skew a derivation that is rs r s a r s r s r then r a r r r that is d 1 q r we say that is a right skew b

quantum differential operators on polynomial algebras 3 1 polynomial algebra in one variable 8 let k be a field and let q k be transcendental over q let r k x be the polynomial algebra in one variable r is z graded with deg x 1 define the bicharacter z z k by n m qnm it is shown in 8 that the algebra of quantum differential operators on r denoted by dq r is a k algebra generated by the set x x 1 0 1 where the operators are given by x xn xn 1 a xn n qax n 1 for a 1 0 1 we now aim to determine a full set of defining relations for these generators and a basis for d dq k x to facilitate the handling of monomials in the generators x and 1 we rewrite and 1 as 1 and 1 respectively in general formulae involving a for a 1 0 1 0 should be interpreted as the generators x 1 and 1 satisfy the weyl algebra or quantized weyl algebra relations ax q ax a 1 a 1 0 1 3 1 and the relations inserting x into commutation relations ax b bx a a 6 b 1 0 1 3 2 there is also q commutation between 1 and 1 1 1 q 1 1 3 3 we shall show that 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 form a full set of defining relations for d in 8 this was claimed for 3 1 3 2 3 3 and an extra relation 3 9 below which we can now derive from the others however the proof given in 8 is invalid 6 iyer and jordan let e denote the k algebra generated by x 1 and 1 subject to the above relations 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 thus there is a surjective k homomorphism e d there will be some abuse of notation in using the same notation for elements of d and e we shall show that is an isomorphism in the following lemma n m is defined as in notation 2 1 lemma 3 1 the following relations where a 1 0 1 and b 1 0 1 hold in both d and e x qa a b q b b a a b 3 4 qa a b q b b a x q a a q b b 3 5 ax n qanxn a n qax n 1 3 6 nax q anx na n qa n 1 a 3 7 q 1 x 1 1 1 1 3 8 q 1 1 q 1 1 x 1 3 9 q 1 1 1 x q 1 q 1 1 3 10 proof both 3 4 and 3 5 are obtained from 3 2 using 3 1 the relations 3 6 and 3 7 can be deduced inductively from 3 1 using 3 3 the relation 3 4 in the case a 1 b 1 simplifies to 3 8 by 3 1 with a 1 and 3 8 we have 3 9 using 3 3 the relation 3 5 in the case a 1 b 1 simplifies to 3 10 remark 3 2 in the initial list of relations 3 3 can be replaced by 3 9 to see this assume that 3 1 3 2 and 3 9 hold and use 3 9 3 2 with a 1 and b 1 and 3 1 with a 1 to write 1 1 q 1 1 x 1 1 3 11 then pre multiply by 1 and apply 3 2 with a 1 and b 1 to obtain 1 1 1 q 1 1 1 x 1 1 1 q 1 1 1 x 2 1 3 12 next apply 3 1 with a 1 and 3 11 to deduce that 1 1 q 1 1 1 thus in our claimed full set of defining relations 3 3 may be replaced by 3 9 in d and in e let a 1 q a 1 x a for a 1 1 by 3 1 there are alternative expressions a q a 1 qa 1 ax in d 1 and 1 act as inverse k automorphisms of k x lemma 3 3 1 1 and 1 are inverses of each other in e as well as in d noetherian algebras of quantum differential operators 7 2 the following relations are satisfied 1 1 1 3 13 a b q b b a a 1 0 1 b 1 1 3 14 proof 1 the relations 1 1 1 1 1 can be derived from 3 1 3 3 and 3 8 2 3 13 is simply 3 8 rewritten in terms of 1 and 3 14 is easily checked using 3 2 lemma 3 4 for a 1 1 the following homogeneous cubic relations hold in d and in e q 2 a 2 a 2 a q a 1 a 2 a q a a 2 2 qa a a 0 3 15 proof these relations which are special cases of relations established for d in 11 follow from previously listed relations on comparing the results of simplifying the expression a q a a x a q a a using 3 4 or using 3 5 notation 3 5 here we establish notation for some algebras related to d by g we denote the subalgebra of d generated by 1 and 1 as the operators 1 and 1 on k x each reduce degree in x by one g is n graded with 1 and 1 having degree 1 as x increases degree in x by one d itself is z graded the actions of 1 and 1 on k x extend to actions on k x x 1 by s we denote the subalgebra of endk k x x 1 generated by 1 1 and x 1 thus s is also n graded and g s by t we denote the subalgebra of s generated by 1 1 and x 1 let dx denote the subalgebra of endk k x x 1 generated by 1 1 x and x 1 as a 1 q a 1 x a a 1 1 dx is generated by x x 1 1 and 1 note that by 3 14 1 q 1 1 and that 1 x qx 1 3 16 it follows that dx is a homomorphic image with x 7 1 of the skew laurent polynomial ring ax x 1 where a is the first weyl algebra generated by and x ax is its localization at the powers of x and is the k automorphism of ax such that x qx and q 1 as ax is simple with group of units xi i z k is not inner and by 15 theorem 1 8 5 ax x 1 is simple whence dx ax x 1 it follows from this that dx and its subalgebras d g s and t are domains and that dx is simple also by 6 theorems 1 12 1 17 dx is right and left noetherian 8 iyer and jordan note that dx is the localization of d at the powers of x which as a consequence of 3 1 form an ore set in d also dx is the localization of s at the powers of x 1 for n 0 and an n graded algebra h let hn denote the n degree component of h definition 3 6 following 11 a special monomial in 1 and is a monomial of the form j 1 or j 1 k 1 where j k are non negative integers thus a special monomial is either a standard monomial d 1 e d e 0 or can be obtained from such a monomial by moving one occurrence of to the left of a power of 1 it is shown in 11 that the special monomials in 1 and form a basis for the subalgebra of d generated by and 1 the number of special monomials of total degree n in 1 and is 1 2 n 2 n 2 and n 1 of these are standard let g denote the set j 1 k 1 j k 0 j 1 k 1 j 0 k 0 thus g consists of the standard monomials j 1 k 1 in 1 1 and and the non standard special monomials in 1 and let d denote the set g xj k 1 j 0 k 0 xj k 1 j 0 k 0 and let e be the corresponding set of monomials in e thus in addition to the monomials in g d contains those standard monomials in x 1 and or in x 1 and having a positive power of x lemma 3 7 the following relations hold in both d and e 1 1 q 2 1 1 3 17 1 n 1 q n 1 1 n 1 for n 0 3 18 1 1 q 1 q 1 1 1 q 1 1 3 19 1 1 q 1 1 1 q 1 21 q 2 1 2 1 q 2 1 1 3 20 proof using 3 13 we see that 1 1 1 1 1 applying 3 14 and 3 13 we obtain 3 17 the same method gives the generalization 3 18 premultiplying 3 8 by and applying 3 2 and 3 3 1 q 1 1 x 1 1 1 3 21 postmultiplying 3 10 by and applying 3 2 and 3 3 1 q 1 1 x 1 q 1 q 1 1 3 22 subtracting 3 21 from 3 22 and applying 3 2 with a 0 and 3 3 yields 3 19 in d the identity 3 20 can be confirmed by calculating the action of each side on xn for n 3 but for e we need to show that it follows noetherian algebras of quantum differential operators 9 from previously derived relations we shall not give full details of this calculation but shall describe the steps involved observe that of the six monomials appearing on the left hand side of 3 15 with a 1 four contain 1 as a submonomial using 3 19 to substitute for 1 in each of these the left hand side of 3 15 with a 1 becomes a linear combination of monomials from g together with 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 and 1 1 the term 2 1 is expressed by 3 15 as a linear combination of special monomials in 1 and and 3 3 converts 1 1 and 1 1 to scalar multiples of standard monomials the identity 3 17 is used to combine the terms in 1 1 and 1 1 in a single term in 1 1 as before 3 19 is used to substitute for 1 in 1 1 1 and 1 1 the upshot of these changes is to convert the left hand side of 3 15 with a 1 to a linear combination of monomials from g together with 1 1 this rearranges to give 3 20 remark 3 8 the following quadratic relation is observed in 11 1 q 1 q 1 1 q 1 1 1 q 1 1 1 0 3 23 using 3 3 this is equivalent to 3 19 lemma 3 9 1 g is spanned by g 2 d is spanned by d 3 e is spanned by e proof 1 note that 3 19 and 3 20 can be used to express 1 and 1 1 as linear combinations of monomials from g for n 0 let fn be the subspace of gn spanned by gn g we show by induction on n that gn fn this is certainly true for n 0 1 let n 1 and suppose that gn 1 fn 1 we need to show that ggn 1 fn for all g 1 1 by the inductive hypothesis it suffices to show that gm fn if m j 1 k 1 gn 1 is standard or if m j 1 k 1 gn 1 is special but not standard so k 6 0 this is clearly true for g 1 consider the case where g 1 if m j 1 k 1 is standard then 1 m is standard if j 0 and otherwise by 3 3 1 m 1 gn 1 fn let m j 1 k 1 k 6 0 be special but not standard if j 0 then by 3 17 1 m q 2 1 1 k 1 1 1 gn 1 fn if j 6 0 then by 3 3 1 m q 1 1 j 1 1 k 1 1 gn 1 fn finally consider the case where g if m is special then m is a linear combination of special monomials by 11 proposition 2 iii 10 iyer and jordan it remains to show that j 1 k 1 fn for all j k 0 this is true when k 0 because j 1 is special let k 0 and suppose inductively that j 1 d 1 fn whenever d k if j 0 then by 3 19 k 1 1 q 1 q 1 1 1 q 1 1 k 1 1 1 gn 1 1 gn 1 k 1 k 1 1 fn if j 6 0 then by 3 3 and 3 20 j 1 k 1 k 1 1 j 1 1 k 1 1 1 gn 1 k j 1 1 k 1 1 fn this completes the proof that gn fn and that g spans g 2 for n 0 let dn be the subspace of d spanned by monomials of degree n in the generators x 1 and 1 thus d n n 0 is a filtration of d and dn d 1 dn 1 let w be the subspace spanned by the standard monomials k 1 in 1 and and the standard monomials k 1 in 1 and we shall show that d j n 1 x nw g it suffices to show that hj j for all h x 1 1 because it will then follow inductively that dn j for all n first consider the case where h x it is clear that x n 1 x nw j so it suffices to show that xg xw g let u be the graded subalgebra generated by 1 and and let w be the subspace of u spanned by the standard monomials in 1 and thusw w using 3 4 with a 0 and b 1 it is shown in the proof of 11 theorem 1 that for n 0 xun 1 xw n 1 un whence xu xw u if m is a special monomial in 1 and then m u so xm xw u xw g now let m j 1 k 1 be a standard monomial if k 0 then m is special and xm xw g and replacing q by q 1 the same is true if j 0 so we can assume that j 6 0 and k 6 0 by 3 3 and 3 8 and writing f j 1 1 k 1 1 xm q 1 jx 1 1 f q 1 j q 1 1 1 f g j thus xg xw g from which it follows that xj j xg j and that xnj j for all n 1 if h 1 1 it suffices to show that hx nw j for all n using 3 6 hxnw xnhw xn 1 w xng xn 1 g xnj xn 1 j j noetherian algebras of quantum differential operators 11 this completes the proof that d n 1 x nw g and the result follows from 1 3 the proof of 2 uses only relations derived from 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 so it also valid for e the next step is to show that the elements of g are linearly indepen dent we will be working in d rather than e so can exploit the action on k x and the fact that d is a domain lemma 3 10 let vn xgn 1 gn then dimvn dimgn 1 proof by calculations in the proof of 11 theorem 1 based on 3 4 j q j 1 j mod xg g and j q 1 j 1 j mod xg g as xg g is a right ideal of g it follows that if 1 1 and m m is a monomial of degree n in 1 1 and then m n mod vn for some k as n q n 1 j n 1 n q 1 mod vn it follows that m n mod vn for some k thus vn has codimension 1 in gn by the action of on k x n vn because n xn n whereas xgn 1 x n 0 therefore dimvn dimgn 1 recall from 3 5 that s is the subalgebra of endk k x x 1 generated by 1 1 and x 1 and t is the subalgebra of s generated by 1 1 and x 1 lemma 3 11 let p be the k algebra generated by x 1 x 2 and x 3 subject to the relations x 2 x 1 q 2 x 1 x 2 x 3 x 1 qx 1 x 3 and x 3 x 2 q 1 x 2 x 3 then c x 23 qx 1 x 2 and d x 1 x 2 are normal in p and t p cp there exist a k automorphism of p pc and a derivation of p cp such that s p cp z also x 1 is normal in s and s x 1 s p dp proof it is straightforward to check that c and d are normal in p let b be the subalgebra generated by x 1 and x 2 a quantum plane with parameter q 2 and let c be the localization of b at the powers of x 1 and x 2 a quantum torus it is well known that c is simple see for example 6 corollary 1 18 the algebra p and its localization px at the powers of x 1 x 2 and x 3 are respectively the skew polynomial ring b x 3 and the skew laurent polynomial ring c x 1 3 where is the k automorphism of b resp c such that x 1 qx 1 and x 2 q 1 x 2 let q p cp and qx px cpx every element of qx has a unique expression of the form ay b where a b c and y is the image of x 3 in qx let i be a non zero ideal of qx and let i f c 12 iyer and jordan fy g i for some g c it is readily checked that i is a non zero ideal of c whence i c and there exists g c such that y g i also i c 0 or i c c and in the latter case i qx let r qx 1 x 2 c then i y g y r gy and i g y g gy g 2 hence r g 2 i c so either r g 2 or i qx but it is clear by a degree argument that r has no square root in c thus i qx which is therefore simple now let w 1 x 1 1 x 1 q 1 1 and w 1 x 1 1 x 1 q 1 1 1 then w 1 w 1 and x 1 generate t while w 1 w 1 and x 1 generate s the actions of w 1 and w 1 on k x are given by w 1 x n 7 qnxn 1 w 1 x n 7 q nxn 1 from this it is clear that w 1 w 1 q 2 w 1 w 1 x 1 w 1 qw 1 x 1 x 1 w 1 q 1 w 1 x 1 and qw 1 w 1 x 2 hence there is a surjective k homomorphism q t such that x 1 w 1 x 2 w 1 and y x 1 let k ker so that t q k by the simplicity of qx either k 0 or x j 1 x k 2 x 3 k for some j k 0 but t is a domain clearly xi k for i 1 2 3 so k 0 and t q from their actions on k x or from 3 1 3 14 and 3 16 it is easy to check the following relations between and the generators of t w 1 qw 1 x 1 w 1 3 24 w 1 q 1 w 1 x 1 w 1 3 25 x 1 x 1 x 2 3 26 there is a k automorphism of p such that x 1 qx 1 x 2 q 1 x 2 and x 3 x 3 it is a routine matter to verify that there is a left derivation such that x 1 x 3 x 1 x 2 x 3 x 2 and x 3 x 2 3 and that c c and c 2 x 3 c cp consequently and induce respectively a k automorphism of q and a derivation of q by 3 24 3 25 and 3 26 and the universal property of skew polynomial rings 6 theorem 2 4 there is a k homomorphism q z s such that x 1 w 1 x 2 w 1 y x 1 and z the element y is clearly normal in the domain q z let l be the localization of q z at the powers of y as y 2 qx 1 x 2 x 1 and x 2 are also invertible in l which is generated by z y u y 1 u 1 u 1 x 1 u 2 u 1 x 2 u 1 1 here u u 1 so and u generate a copy of the first weyl algebra a 1 also u 1 q 1 u 1 and u 1 u quu 1 so l is isomorphic to the simple ring a 1 u 1 1 where q 1 noetherian algebras of quantum differential operators 13 and u qu consequently either ker 0 or as q z is a domain y ker but by the action on x 1 on k x y 6 0 so q z s is an isomorphism notice that l dx the algebra q z yq z is generated by the images of x 1 x 2 and z subject to the relations zx 1 qx 1 z zx 2 q 1 x 2 z and x 1 x 2 0 so q z yq z p dp also s x 1 s q z yq z p dp theorem 3 12 1 for n 1 dimgn n 2 n 1 and g is a basis for g the hilbert series for g is 1 t 2 1 t 3 and gkdim g 3 2 d is a basis for d proof 1 the number of monomials of degree n in the spanning set g for g is n 2 n 1 1 2 n 2 n 1 n n 1 the number of standard monomials in 1 1 and of degree n being 1 2 n 2 n 1 and the number of non standard special monomials in 1 and of degree n being 1 2 n n 1 the generating function for the sequence n 2 n 1 n 0 is 1 t 2 1 t 3 so it suffices to show that dimgn n 2 n 1 let w denote the k subspace of g spanned by the standard mono mials in 1 and and the standard monomials in 1 and and let wn w gn let be the composition of the homomorphisms g s s x 1 s p dp where p and d are as in lemma 3 11 thus 1 x 1 1 x 2 x 3 and 1 1 0 the standard monomials in 1 and and the standard monomials in 1 and form a basis for p dp it follows that the standard monomials in 1 and and the standard monomials in 1 and are linearly independent hence dimkwn 2 n 1 for all n 0 it also follows that the restriction of to w is injective so as g x 1 s 0 we have w x 1 s 0 whence w x 1 g 0 and xw g 0 the sum j n 1 x nw g is direct to see this let jk k n 1 x nw g for k 1 we have seen that the sum j 1 g is direct suppose that k 1 and that the sum jk 1 is direct let x kw xkw jk 1 then w w x 1 s 0 so jk is direct by induction j is a direct sum in the proof of lemma 3 9 we saw that xg xw g whence xgn 1 xwn 1 gn therefore xgn 1 xwn 1 vn where vn xgn 1 gn as in lemma 3 10 by lemma 3 10 dimk vn dn 1 as x is invertible in endkk x 1 dimk xgn 1 dn 1 and dimk xwn 1 14 iyer and jordan dimkwn 1 2 n 3 therefore dn 1 dn 2 n 2 it is readily checked that dn n 2 n 1 is the solution to this difference equation with initial condition d 0 1 thus dimkgn n 2 n 1 as required completing the proof as indicated at the start 2 we have seen that d j n 1 x nw g and that this sum is direct as x is regular in endk k x andw has a basis w consisting of the monomials that are standard in 1 and or in 1 each summand xnw has basis xnw while g has basis g by 1 the result follows as the sum is direct corollary 3 13 d e is generated by the four generators x 1 1 and and presented by the relations 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 proof there is a surjective homomorphism e d the elements of d are linearly independent so application of to any linear combi nation of elements of e shows that the same is true for the spanning set e of e from which it follows that is an isomorphism remark 3 14 we close this subsection with some comments on the algebra dq k x x 1 it is shown in 8 theorem 3 1 that this algebra is generated by the set x x 1 1 1 this is the algebra denoted dx in notation 3 5 so dq k x x 1 ax x 1 a skew laurent polynomial ring over the first weyl algebra furthermore the relations 3 1 3 3 along with the relation x x 1 x 1 x 1 form a full set of defining relations for these generators note that the proof in 8 theorem 3 1 for the case of k x x 1 is valid whereas the proof for k x is invalid an alternative set of generators is x x 1 1 1 we thank s datt for pointing out the following corollary 3 15 there exists an isomorphism between dq k x x 1 and its opposite algebra dq k x x 1 o such that the isomorphism re stricts to an isomorphism of dq k x and its opposite dq k x o proof use the generators to define dq k x x 1 dq k x x 1 as follows x x o x 1 x 1 o o 1 q 1 1 o 1 q 1 o this gives the required isomorphism in terms of the alternative set of generators given in remark 3 14 above x x o x 1 x 1 o o 1 q 1 1 o and 1 q 1 o noetherian algebras of quantum differential operators 15 3 2 the noetherian property this section addresses the noether ian property for some of the algebras of quantum differential operators dq r previously considered we begin with two cases where the in vertibility of generators of r allows a change of generators that yields dq r as a k algebra that can be constructed from k by a combina tion of polynomial extensions skew polynomial extensions and skew laurent extensions 3 3 the noetherian condition and localization we have seen in the discussion within notation 3 5 that dq k x 1 is right and left noetherian this is a localization of dq k x at the powers of a single element x in this subsection we discuss the general situation where a is a domain and 0 6 a a is such that a ai i 0 is a right and left ore set and the localization aa is known to be right and left noetherian we prove a result sufficient to show that dq k x is right and left noetherian provided q is transcendental over q definition 3 16 let a be a domain let 0 6 a a and let c be a subring of a such that a c we say that a is right resp left c seminormal in a if a is normal in c that is ac ca and for all r a there exists k n such that rak ac resp akr ca note that if a is right c seminormal in a then ai i n is a right ore set in a for given r a and j n there exist c c c and k n such that rak ac and caj 1 aj 1 c whence rak j 1 ajc similarly if a is left c seminormal then ai i n is a left ore set in a if a is both right and left c seminormal then ai i n is an ore set and the right and left localizations coincide by 6 proposition 9 8 lemma 3 17 let a be a domain let 0 6 a a and let c be a subring of a such that a c and a is normal in c let d d a dak ac for some k n then d is a subring of a and if a is also a k algebra d is a subalgebra of a consequently if a is generated as a ring or as a k algebra by elements of d then a is right c seminormal in a proof it suffices to show that d is closed under addition and multi plication let b d a with baj ab and dak ad where b d c and k j then b d ak a d b ak j ac so d is closed under addition also by the normality of a in c there exists d c such that d aj 1 aj 1 d hence bdak j 1 bad aj 1 bajd ab d ac thus d is closed under multiplication and is a subring of a 16 iyer and jordan example 3 18 let t be a commutative domain with a derivation let a be the ore extension or skew polynomial ring t t and let a t 0 let c be the subring of a generated by t and at here a is normal in c with at a a at a also t d as ta 2 a at 2 a thus a is right c seminormal in a the fact that ai i n is a right ore set in a in this case is well known and is a special case of 5 1 4 a particular instance instructive for quantum differential operators is that of the weyl algebra k x x x 1 k x d dx with a x and with c generated by x and z x here zx x z 2 and c is the ore extension k z x where is the k automorphism of k z such that z z 2 example 3 19 we have seen that dq k x is generated as a k algebra by x 1 and 1 the subalgebra t generated by x x 1 and x 1 or equivalently by q 1 x 1 1 and 1 q 1 1 x 1 1 is commutative and x is normal in the sub algebra c generated by t and x where x 1 x and x q 1 x also x 2 x x 2 1 x 2 x q 2 x 1 q 1 and 1 x 2 x q 2 x 1 q 1 1 so d contains all four generators of dq k x and by lemma 3 17 x is right c seminormal similar calculations show that x is left c seminormal thus xi i n is an ore set in dq k x as dq k x x 1 is generated by dq k x and x 1 the right and left localization ofdq k x at x i i n isdq k x x 1 in theorem 3 21 below we show that under some extra conditions satisfied in example 3 19 if the localization of a at the powers of a seminormal element is noetherian then so is a this depends on the following ungraded version of a result of rogalski 17 on n graded rings theorem 3 20 rogalski let r s be rings such that r is a left ore domain and s is left noetherian then r is left noetherian if for all nonzero elements r of r the left r modules sr r rr and s r sr are noetherian proof see 17 lemmas 5 9 and 5 10 these lemmas appear in 17 in the context of n graded rings r and s lemma 5 9 is a general result in the graded context and although lemma 5 10 is explicitly about particular rings r and s the only extra property that is used in the proof is the left ore property for r for the non graded version view r as n graded with r r 0 in other more informal words ignore the references to homogeneity and shift noetherian algebras of quantum differential operators 17 theorem 3 21 let a be a right and left c seminormal element of a domain a and let be the automorphism of c such that ca a c for all c c suppose that the left module a aa is simple that i 0 a ia 0 and that for each c c ca there are only finitely many positive integers j such that j c aa c if the localization b of a at ai i n is left noetherian then a is left noetherian proof we show that a is left noetherian using theorem 3 20 with r a and s b let r x a as b is a left noetherian domain it is left ore so there exist c d a and m n 0 such that a ncx a mdr premultiplying by at where t max m n we see that c 1 x d 1 r for some c 1 d 1 a thus a is left ore suppose that r 6 0 consider the ascending chain ar aa 1 r a aa jr a aa j 1 r a the union of this chain is br a also aa j 1 r a ar aa j 1 r ar aa j 1 a a aaj 1 so aa j 1 r a ar has finite length and is a noetherian left module to show that br a ar is noetherian it will suffice to show that terminates as i 1 a ia 0 there exists j 0 such that r aju aja where u a aa then br bu and aa j t r a aa tu a for t 0 so deleting the first j terms in the chain gives the corresponding chain for u thus we may assume that r aa let k 0 be minimal such that rak ac and let c c be such that rak ac note that c ca otherwise rak 1 ac contradicting the minimality of k unless k 0 and r ac aa by hypothesis there exists n n such that for all j n j c aa let j n and let s ta j 1 r aa j 1 r a where t a then sak ta j 1 rak ta j 1 ac ta jc t j c a j whence t j c a j k s a and t j c aaj k aa let i be the left ideal x a x j c aa thus t i as a j c j 1 c a aa we have aa i however 1 i so by the maximality of aa i aa thus t ua for some u a and s ua jr aa jr a it follows that terminates and that br a ar is noetherian now consider the ascending chain a br aa 1 br aa j br aa j 1 br 18 iyer and jordan the union of which is b also aa j a aa j br a br so aa j br a br has finite length to show that b a br is noetherian it suffices to show that terminates let k c n and j be as above so that j c aa and j c a k j a j 1 r by the maximality of aa there exist u v a such that 1 u j c va then a k j u j c a k j va k j 1 ua j 1 r va k j 1 br aa k j 1 thus terminates and by theorem 3 20 b is left noetherian we now adapt methods from 11 to show that x and d dq k x satisfy the first of the extra hypotheses required for theorem 3 21 to be applicable proposition 3 22 let d dq k x then the left module d dx is simple proof we aim to show that d dx k we claim that for j 1 j q j jqj 1 j 1 mod dx 3 27 where j q qj 1 q 1 by 3 5 with a 0 and b 1 q 1 1 q 1 x 3 28 which establishes 3 27 when j 1 let j 1 and suppose that 3 27 holds for j 1 multiplying throughout 3 28 on the left by j 1 j q j 1 1 mod dx 3 29 multiplying throughout 3 28 on the right by j 1 and using 3 7 with a 0 and n j 1 j q 1 j 1 1 q 1 j 1 x j 1 j 2 1 j 1 q 1 j 2 mod dx 1 j 1 j 2 q j 1 1 j 1 mod dx q 1 j j 1 q j q j 1 1 j 1 mod dx simplifying we see that j j q j 1 j 1 q j jqj 1 j 1 mod dx that is 3 27 holds for j to show that d dx k let m be a monomial of length in the generators x 1 and 1 it is enough to show that m dx k noetherian algebras of quantum differential operators 19 this is certainly true if 1 so suppose it is true for monomials of length 1 and let m gm where m is a monomial of length 1 and g x 1 1 by 3 27 and its analogue for 1 if g 1 1 then gk dx k the same is true if g and as x j jx j j 1 if g x hence m gm g dx k dx gk dx k the left module k over the first weyl algebra a 1 k x x x 1 with x acting by differentiation with respect to and by left multiplication is well known to be simple therefore d dx is simple as a left d module and may be identified with k remark 3 23 analogous methods with 3 28 replaced by 1 x 1 q 1 x show that the right module d xd is also simple and can be identified with k for all f k f xd 1 0 where d is the degree of f so if u i 1 x id then u annd k but d is simple so annd k 0 and hence i 1 x id 0 the second hypothesis in theorem 3 21 proposition 3 24 with the notation from example 3 19 let 0 6 c c xc and suppose that q is transendental over q then j c dx c for only finitely many positive integers j proof here c k 1 x where q and 1 also 1 x dx and q 1 1 q 1 1 dx so dx c is the maximal ideal of c generated by x 1 and q 1 as c xc the constant term c 0 of c as a polynomial in x over k 1 is nonzero thus c 0 c 0 k 1 and j c dx c if and only if c 0 q j 1 j 1 0 the result follows by applying the methods of 17 section 12 in particular 17 12 7 and 12 8 to the homogenisation of c 0 in k t where s is minimal such that sc 0 k corollary 3 25 if q is transcendental over q then dq k x is left and right noetherian proof this follows from theorem 3 21 proposition 3 22 remark 3 23 and proposition 3 24 and their right sided analogues remark 3 26 rogalski 17 theorem 13 3 shows that the subalgebra of dq k x generated by and 1 is noetherian by 3 14 it follows that the algebra t generated by 1 and 1 is also noetherian being a homomorphic image of a skew laurent polynomial ring over a noetherian ring by 3 13 1 t so dq k x is generated by 20 iyer and jordan t and x corollary 3 25 can be deduced directly from this using 15 theorem 2 10 3 4 generalization to the polynomial algebra in several vari ables let r k x 1 xn which is z n graded by deg xi ei where ei is the standard basis element 0 0 1 0 0 let q 1 qn k be transcendental over q let zn zn k be such that ei ej qi if i j 1 if i 6 j then we know from 8 that dq r is generated as an algebra by the set xi 1 i i i 1 i n and that dq r is a simple domain here in notation 2 1 k i x a ai qk i xa ei where k 1 0 1 a a 1 an z n and xa xa 11 x an n the following relations can be seen k i xj ij kei k i m j 0 for i 6 j k i a 0 when ai 0 ei k i q 1 i k i ei let rs n be the commutative algebra k x 1 1 x 1 s xs 1 xn it is shown in 8 that the algebra dq rs n is generated by the set xi x 1 j 1 i i i 1 i n j s and that dq rs n is a simple domain also following corollary 3 15 we see that dq rs n dq rs n o for every s 0 s n remark 3 27 it would be very interesting to know whether the hy potheses in theorem 3 21 in particular the simplicity of a aa can be relaxed sufficiently to deal with dq r where r is the polynomial algebra k x 1 xn n 2 indeterminates x 1 xn and there is a noetherian localization dq k x 1 1 x 1 n obtained by inverting the powers of the element x 1 xn this would also cover the above al gebras dq rs n and potentially the algebra of quantum differential operators over the coordinate algebra of the quantum plane discussed in the next section 4 quantum coordinate algebras and quantum tori 4 1 the quantum plane 9 let q k be transcendental over q let r k x y xy qyx the coordinate algebra of the quantum plane let z 2 with standard basis e 1 e 2 here we summarise the noetherian algebras of quantum differential operators 21 results from 9 on the quantum differential operators for the bicharac ter k be given by ei ej q if i j 1 if i 6 j the algebra r is graded by with deg x e 1 and deg y e 2 note that x x e 2 and y y e 1 for a 1 0 1 let a x a y endk r be as follows a x x iyj i qa x i 1 yj and a y x iyj j qa x iyj 1 let dx and dy be the subalgebras of dq r generated by x a x a 1 0 1 and y a y a 1 0 1 respectively as k algebras dx dy dq k t where dq k t is as in subsection 3 1 further dq r which is a simple domain and dx dy dq r as filtered algebras as in the case of the commutative polynomial algebra in 2 indeterminates we do not know whether dq r is noetherian though its localization at the powers of xy is noetherian as will be shown in theorem 4 20 remark 4 1 the bicharacter above corresponds to the matrix q 1 1 q denote by x e 1 and y e 2 for r the quantum plane as above then d 0 q r is the subalgebra of hom r r generated by the set 1 x 1 y x y if the bicharacter corresponds to the matrix 1 q q 1 1 then x e 2 and y e 1 and again we see that d 0 q r is the subalgebra of hom r r generated by the set 1 x 1 y x y this bicharacter is natural as defined below in section 4 2 similarly when corresponds to 1 q q 1 we have x e 2 and y e 1 once we see that d 0 q r is the same algebra in each case we refer to 8 corollary 1 1 which states that diq r is generated as a d 0 q r module by the set homogeneous r di 1 q r r r that is in each of the three cases of the algebra dq r is the same 4 2 higher quantum coordinate algebras let n be an integer n 1 and qij k for 1 i j n let rn k x 1 xn xixj qijxjxi 22 iyer and jordan denote the coordinate algebra of quantum affine n space kn through out this section we assume that the elements qij are algebraically inde pendent over q for 1 s n rs n will denote the localization of rn with respect to the ore set t xi 11 x is s i 1 is 0 that is rs n k x 1 1 x 1 s xs 1 xn xixj qijxjxi we refer to rs n as a quantum torus in particular rn n is the quantum n torus note rs n is z n graded with deg xi ei where ei is the standard basis element 0 0 1 0 0 we have the natural bicharacter zn zn k given by ei ej qij note that in the case where each qij 1 the natural bicharacter is not the bicharacter used in the previous section when r was a commutative polynomial algebra or torus the following result tells us that if we can identify dq rn then we can identify the dq rs n for each quantum torus so we will con centrate first on quantum coordinate algebras of kn and then consider quantum tori proposition 4 2 for any dq rs n there exists t t such that t dq rn proof this is seen by induction on the order of for d 0 q rs n is given by multiplications and grading maps and hence the result is true let i 1 and suppose that diq rs n is such that r di 1 q rs n for all r rs n replacing by 1 we can assume that 1 0 for each l n xl d i 1 q rs n so there exists tl t such that t xl d i 1 q r hence there exists t x i 1 1 x is s t such that t xl d i 1 q r for all l n let c i 1 e 1 ises then t xl c t xl d i 1 q r further t grhomk r r and hence t d i q r remark 4 3 proposition 4 2 is true even when 1 for the quantum torus or for the polynomial algebra and any general by setting c 0 in the proof above 4 3 the quantized coordinate algebra on more than two vari ables let rn k x 1 xn xixj qijxjxi denote the coordinate algebra of quantum n space the algebra rn is z n graded and we shall use the natural bicharacter noetherian algebras of quantum differential operators 23 4 3 1 the algebra d 0 q r as explained in section 2 the algebra d 0 q r is a homomorphic image of r z r r o zn where a bo 7 a b note that z r k further xi xi ei for 1 i n hence d 0 q r is generated as an algebra by the set xi ei ei 1 i n that is d 0 q r is a homomorphic image of r z n suppose i ri ai 0 then by degree considerations and using the fact that r is a domain we may assume that i i ai 0 since the parameters qij are algebraically independent applying on the monomials xiyj we get i 0 i that is d 0 q r r zn in particular d 0 q r is a domain free over r with basis a a z n 4 3 2 the r bimodule d 1 q r proposition 4 4 let be an endomorphism of rn and for 1 i n let i xi then i xj qij xj i qij j xi xi j proof this follows from xixj qij xjxi the next result reveals a significant difference between the case n 2 and the case n 3 corollary 4 5 let end r and for 1 i n let i xi 1 let n 2 and suppose there exists a zn such that 1 a and 2 0 then there exists m z such that a e 1 me 2 similarly if 1 0 and 2 a for some a z n then there exists m z such that a me 1 e 2 2 let n 3 and suppose there exist a zn and 1 i n such that i a and j 0 for j 6 i then a ei 3 let n 3 and let 1 i n there is a right ei derivation i of rn such that i xi ei and i xj 0 if j 6 i proof 1 we have a x 2 q 12 x 2 a 0 thus a x 2 q 12 x 2 a e 2 q 12 a e 1 e 2 1 and a e 1 me 2 for some m the second claim is proved similarly 2 choose j 1 j 2 such that i j 1 and j 2 are distinct since j 1 j 2 0 we can apply the reasoning in the proof of 1 to conclude that a ei ej 1 1 and a ei ej 2 1 thus there are integers m 1 and m 2 such that a ei m 1 ej 1 and a ei m 2 ej 2 it follows that mj 1 mj 2 0 3 set i xi 1 and i xj 0 if j 6 i then i extends to a right ei derivation i of rn such that for j 6 i xixj qijxj qij xjxi so that the defining relations of rn are respected and i is indeed a right ei derivation of rn it is a routine matter to verify that i xi ei and i xj 0 if j 6 i 24 iyer and jordan definition 4 6 let n 3 and let 1 i n we shall retain the notation of corollary 4 5 3 thus i is the right ei derivation i of rn such that i xi 1 and i xj 0 if j 6 i in general for 1 i n i x m 1 1 x m 2 2 x mn n mi j i q mj ij xm 11 x mi 1 i 1 x mi 1 i x mi 1 i 1 x mn n let i ei i then i is a left ei derivation of rn such that i xi 1 i xj 0 if j 6 i and i xj ei if i j 0 if i 6 j theorem 4 7 the left d 0 q r module d 1 q r is generated by the set i 1 i n 1 proof let d 1 q r d 0 q r be such that xi d 0 q r for 1 i n by considering 1 we assume that 1 0 let deg riei for ri z note deg xj rj 1 ej i 6 j riei since xj d 0 q r we have rj 1 for every j case 1 suppose that rj 1 for some j then for i 6 j some monomial ti r and ai k we have xi ti ai zn ai ai implies that ti 0 since ti cannot have degree 1 in the variable xj further ri 0 for i 6 j that is xj t a zn a a xi 0 for i 6 j where t i 6 j x ri i to avoid too much notation without loss of generality consider the case x 1 t a zn a a xi 0 for i 6 1 note x 1 xi q 1 i xix 1 for i 6 1 implies that t a zn a a xi q 1 ixi t a zn a a hence xi t a zn a a ei a xi t a zn q 1 i a a since d 0 a r is a domain and the set a a zn is linearly independent over k we have a a ei aq 1 i noetherian algebras of quantum differential operators 25 thus whenever a 6 0 a ei q 1 i hence a e 1 maiei for some mai z for every i i 6 1 since n 3 this implies that a e 1 that is x 1 t e 1 e 1 and xi 0 for i 6 1 since 1 0 this implies that e 1 t 1 case 2 assume that rj 0 for every j 1 j n let xi ti a zn i a a for i n for each i let ti xi xr 11 x rn n by relacing by i i ei ti ei we assume that xi ti a zn ei ia a for i n without loss of generality assume that x 1 6 0 suppose 1 a 6 0 for some a ze 1 then there exists c k such that a c t 1 x 1 a e 1 has the property a x 1 1 a t 1 a therefore replacing by a ze 1 1 a 6 0 a we have two subcases subcase 1 x 1 t 1 n n 0 n 6 1 1 ne 1 ne 1 and n 0 e 1 6 0 here if xi 0 for every i 6 1 then by considering the equation x 1 xi q 1 i xix 1 we see that 1 ne 1 0 whenever n 6 1 this contradicts our assumption hence we can assume that x 2 t 2 a zn e 2 2 a a 6 0 now consider the equation x 1 x 2 q 12 x 2 x 1 note that xi xi ei then there exist c 12 c 21 k such that x 1 x 2 c 21 t qn 012 1 n 0 e 1 n 0 e 1 e 2 c 12 t 2 a a e 1 while q 12 x 1 x 2 c 12 t q

thus we get c 21 q n 0 12 1 n 0 e 1 c 12 2 a c 12 q 12 qa 1 2 a c 21 q 12 1 n 0 e 1 note q 12 qa 1 1 thus we see that n 0 1 which contradicts our assumption hence n 0 e 1 e 2 6 a e 1 with 2 a 6 0 then we have c 21 q n 0 12 1 n 0 e 1 c 21 q 12 1 n 0 e 1 which also implies that n 0 1 we therefore move to the next subcase subcase 2 x 1 0 for any i such that xi 6 0 we consider the equation x 1 xi q 1 i xix 1 this gives rise to the equation x 1 ti a zn ei ia a x 1 ti a zn ei q 1 iqa 1 i a a thus implying that qa 1 qi 1 in other words a ei ne 1 for some n z dependent on a in particular if x 2 6 0 then x 2 t 2 n z 0 2 n ne 1 e 2 for 26 iyer and jordan any n such that 2 n 6 0 there exists cn k such that n cn t 2 x 2 ne 1 has the property that n x 2 2 n t 2 ne 1 e 2 note that n x 1 0 thus replacing by 2 n 6 0 n we get that x 1 x 2 0 this in turn implies for i 1 2 by considering x 2 xi q 2 i xix 2 that whenever i a 6 0 we get a ei me 2 and by considering x 1 xi q 1 i xix 1 a ei ne 1 for some m n z dependent on a thus a ei which contradicts our assumptions hence x 1 x 2 0 implies that xi 0 for every i 1 2 thus t 4 3 3 the algebra dq r we first present some relations among the operators xi i ei 1

if any jr ir define the degree of i j to be i j z n define the standard degree of i j to be i j when appropriate we use the lexico graphical ordering on zn theorem 4 9 the algebra is a simple left and right noetherian domain of gk dimension 2 n with basis i j proof let ij be a n n matrix over k with non zero entries such that ji 1 ij for 1 i j n and i i 1 for 1 i n let a n denote the k algebra

an example of the higher quantized weyl algebras studied in 12 and it is an iterated skew polynomial ring over k constructed by adjoining u 1 v 1 un vn in turn using automorphisms and skew derivations it is therefore right and left noetherian and has basis ua 11 u an n v b 1 1 v bn n ai bi 0 it has an obvious filtration with deg ui deg vi 1 for which the associated graded ring gr a n is generated by ui and vi 1 i n subject to the relations vjvi jivivj 1 i j n ujui jiuiuj 1 i j n ujvi ijviuj 1 i j n this is the coordinate algebra of a quantum space and has the same growth as the commutative polynomial algebra in 2 n indeterminates the filtration is standard and finite dimensional in the sense of 15 and it follows from 15 proposition 8 1 14 that gkdim a n gkdim gr a n 2 n it is shown in 12 theorem 6 5 that provided char k 0 a n is simple for all alternatively it is not difficult to adapt the well known proof of simplicity of the usual weyl algebra an where each ij 1 so as to apply to a n if ij qji there is a surjective k algebra homomorphism a n given by ui i and vi xi as a n is simple is an isomorphism and the result follows remark 4 10 1 the group zn acts on by xi ei xi and i ei 1 i so we can form the skew group algebra zn the algebra zn can be viewed as an iterated skew laurent polynomial extension of 2 there is a homomorphism of algebras f zn dq r with f 7 for z n theorem 4 11 the algebra zn is a left and right noetherian sim ple domain with basis i j and gk dimension 3 n 28 iyer and jordan proof by 15 theorem 1 5 12 and theorem 1 4 5 zn is a right and left noetherian domain by the condition that the qij s generate a free abelian group zn acts as a group of outer automorphisms so by 15 proposition 7 8 12 zn is simple simplicity can also be established by successively applying 15 theorem 1 8 5 or 6 theorem 1 17 the stated set is clearly a basis and it is easy to see that gkdim zn 3 n remark 4 12 1 the algebra zn is generated by the set xi i 1 ei 1 i n note that xi xi ei so z n is also generated by the set xi i 1 ei 1 i n or by xi i 1 ei 1 i n where i is the left ei derivation ei i the subalgebra sn of dq r generated by the set xi i 1 i n is also isomorphic to a quantized weyl algebra of the form a n and hence is simple 2 the algebra dq r has a filtration d 0 q r d 1 q r the algebra is also filtered with filtration 0 1 where m k span i j j m this induces a filtration on zn given by zn m m z n 3 the following formula and lemmas will be needed in the next theorem for 1 i n j 1 1 j 2 2 jn n a xi ji i s q js s i a ei j 1 1 ji 1 i jn n a ei a

1 i j a i j a i j a without loss of generality assume that is homogeneous for each tuple i j a there ex ists i j a grhom r r such that i j a x 1 i j a j a that is i i j a x 1 i j a i j a and i j a xi 0 i 1 we may therefore assume that x 1 j a and xi 0 i 1 now for every i 1 since x 1 xi q 1 i xix 1 we have j axi q 1 i xi j a that is there exist c 1 c 2 k such that a ei q 1 i c 1 xi j a ei c 2 ji j

for every i 1 lemma 4 14 suppose dq r is such that xi 0 and for some j 6 i xj i j a i j a i j a 6 0 then there is an i 0 such that whenever i 0 j a 6 0 we have a ej zei and ji 0 proof to avoid confusion with several indices we show that if x 1 0 and x 2 i j a i j a i j a 6 0 then there is an i 0 such that whenever i 0 j a 6 0 we have a e 2 ze 1 and j 1 0 the general case can be inferred since x 1 x 2 q 12 x 2 x 1 we have x 1 i j a i j a i j a q 12 i j a i j a i j a x 1 x 1 i j a a e 1 q 12 i j a i j a i j a a e 1 q 12 i j acjj 1 i j e 1 a e 1 for some cj k therefore by setting qa 1 a e 1 we have x 1 i j a 1 qa 1 q 12 i j a i j a i j a qa 1 q 12 i j acjj 1 i j e 1 a e 1 using the fact that x 1 x 1 e 1 there exist dj k such that i j a 1 qa 1 q 12 i j adj i e 1 j a e 1 i j a qa 1 q 12 i j acjj 1 i j e 1 a e 1 4 6 let i 0 be the greatest index with respect to lexicographical ordering such that i 0 j a 6 0 for some j a then the equation 4 6 implies that qa 1 q 21 whenever i 0 j a 6 0 that is whenever i 0 j a 6 0 we have q e 2 ze 1 30 iyer and jordan moreover we have i 0 j a 1 qa 1 q 12 i 0 e 1 j adj j a e 1 i i 0 i 6 i 0 e 1 i j a 1 qa 1 q 12 i e 1 j adj j a e 1 i 0 j a qa 1 q 12 i 0 j acjj 1 j e 1 a e 1 i i 0 i j a qa 1 q 12 i j acjj 1 j e 1 a e 1 equating the coefficients of i 0 we get j a 1 qa 1 q 12 i 0 e 1 j adj j a e 1 j a qa 1 q 12 i 0 j acjj 1 j e 1 a e 1 4 7 recall that i 0 j a 6 0 implies that a e 2 ze 1 hence every a z n in the left hand side of the above equation 4 7 is such that a e 2 ze 1 that is qa 1 q 21 in other words the left hand side of equation 4 7 is zero the right hand side of equation 4 7 is therefore zero that is whenever i 0 j a 6 0 we get j 1 0 corollary 4 15 if homogeneous dq r is such that xi xj 0 for some i 6 j and xk f z n for all k 6 i j then f zn proof without loss of generality assume that x 1 x 2 0 and x 3 f z n following the proof of lemma 4 14 the multi index i 0 of the highest order in lexicographical ordering and multi index j 0 0 0 j 0 3 j 0 n are such that x 3 i 0 j 0 m z m e 3 me 1 i i 0 i j a zn a a and x 3 i 0 j 0 s z s e 3 se 2 i i 0 i j a zn a a noetherian algebras of quantum differential operators 31 for some m a m a k therefore we have x 3 i 0 j 0 e 3 i i 0 i j a zn a a for some k since j 0 0 0 j 0 3 j 0 n we have i 0 j 0 e 3 x 1 i 0 j 0 e 3 x 2 0 and i 0 j 0 e 3 x 3 i i 0 i j a zn a a proceeding simi larly there is a f zn such that x 1 x 2 x 3 0 continuing by induction we prove the corollary lemma 4 16 suppose homogeneous dq r is such that xi 0 and for some j 6 i xj i j a i j a i j a 6 0 then there exists a f zn such that xi xj 0 proof without loss of generality we may assume that x 1 0 and x 2 i j a i j a i j a 6 0 following the proof of lemma 4 14 the multi index i 0 of the highest order in lexicographical ordering is such that i 0 j a 6 0 implies that j 1 0 and a e 2 nae 1 for some na z dependent on a thus there exist m a k such that x 2 i 0 j 0 m z m e 2 me 1 i i 0 i j a zn a a suppose degree of is t t 1 t 2 tn and i 0 i 0 1 i 0 2 i 0 n then j 0 i 0 e 2 t since 1 is not a factor of j 0 we have t 1 i 0 1 0 thus for any i i 0 for which a 6 0 in the above sum we have i i 1 i 2 in with i 1 i 0 1 0 and 1 is not a factor of any of the corresponding j that is t 1 x 1 is a factor of x 2 similarly t 1 x 1 is a factor of xi for every i 2 if we prove the lemma for homogeneous with degree 0 t 2 tn then the general case is a multiple of t 1 x 1 so without loss of generality assume that t 1 i 0 1 0 and that 1 is not a factor of any of j 0 and j corresponding to those i such that a 6 0 in the above equation and any commutator equation xi for i 2 we now show that there exists f zn such that x 1 x 2 0 it is enough to show that there exists f z n such that x 1 0 and x 2 i i 0 i j a zn a a 32 iyer and jordan for some a k in other words we need to show the existence of f zn such that x 1 0 and x 2 i 0 j 0 m z m e 2 me 1 i i 0 i j a zn ra a for some r k note that i 0 j 0 e 2 x 1 0 and i 0 j 0 e 2 x 2 e 2 further for any m 6 0 if i 0 0 i 0 2 i 0 n is such that i 0 2 0 then there is c k such that c i 0 e 2 j 0 me 1 x 1 0 and c i 0 e 2 j 0 me 1 x 2 i 0 j 0 e 2 me 1 i i 0 i j a zn sa a for some sa k it remains to show that if x 2 i 0 j 0 m z m e 2 me 1 i i 0 i j a zn a a then i 02 0 and m 6 0 implies that m 0 suppose i 02 0 and m 0 6 0 for some m 0 6 0 in view of lemma 4 13 we assume that there is an i 2 such that xi 6 0 without loss of generality let x 3 p 0 q 0 s z s e 3 se 1 p p 0 p q a zn a a with 1 not a factor of q 0 and p 0 0 p 0 2 p 0 n now consider the identity x 2 x 3 q 23 x 3 x 2 that is x 2 x 3 q 23 x 3 x 2 q 23 x 3 x 2 x 2 x 3 that is there are scalars c 1 c 2 k such that qm 013 1 c 1 i 0 e 3 j 0 e 2 e 3 m 0 e 1 rest qm 013 1 c 2 p 0 e 2 q 0 e 2 e 3 m 0 e 1 rest in other words i 0 e 3 p 0 e 2 which would imply that i 0 2 6 0 unless m 0 0 this contradicts our assumption made in the beginning of this paragraph we have thus proved the lemma theorem 4 17 the map f zn dq r is an isomorphism of filtered algebras proof by theorem 4 11 zn is simple and hence f is injective it remains to show that f is surjective and that f is a map of filtered algebras noetherian algebras of quantum differential operators 33 to show that f is surjective it suffices to show that if a homogeneous grhom r r is such that xi f z n for every i n then f zn suppose that xi 0 for every i n then 1 f z n moreover in view of lemmas 4 13 4 16 and corollary 4 15 assume that xi 6 0 for every i let x 1 i j a i j a i j a f z n note that if a ze 1 then by formula 4 5 i j e 1 a e 1 x 1 c i j a for some c k similarly by the formula 4 5 for any a ze 1 and x 1 a factor of i i e 1 j a x 1 c 1 i e 1 j e 1 a e 1 c 2 i j a for some c 1 c 2 k thus we may replace by for some f zn and use induction on m where x 1 f m z n so that x 1 i j a i j a i j a where i j a 6 0 implies that a ze 1 and x 1 is not a factor of i we claim that this will imply that x 1 0 consider x 1 xi q 1 i xix 1 that is x 1 xi q 1 ixi x 1 q 1 i xi x 1 x 1 xi 4 8 note that x 1 is not a factor in any of the terms which appear in the left hand side fix an i 1 let xi m n b m n b m n b then there exist cm n b k such that q 1 i xi x 1 x 1 xi x 1 m n b q 1 i b 1 1 m n b m n b m n b n 1 m n bcm n b m n e 1 b e 1 since x 1 and hence x 1 is not a factor of any term in the left hand side of 4 8 we have q 1 i b 1 1 for every b whenever m n b 6 0 that is b ei ze 1 this further implies that b e 1 ei ze 1 since i j a 6 0 implies that a ze 1 again using 4 8 we conclude that n 1 0 whenever m n b 6 0 thus q 1 i xi x 1 x 1 xi 0 hence by 4 8 for every i 1 we have x 1 xi q 1 ixi x 1 that is x 1 1 e 1 x 1 f z n and x 1 1 e 1 xi 0 for all i 1 by the lemma 4 13 we have x 1 1 e 1 x 1 x 1 1 e 1 t e 1 for some t in the subalgebra of f zn generated by the set xi 1 i n 1 that is x 1 t 2 e 1 this contradicts the assumption on unless t 0 so we have x 1 0 now we appeal to lemmas 4 14 and 4 16 and corollary 4 15 to claim the conclusion of the theorem 34 iyer and jordan corollary 4 18 the algebra dq r is a left and right noetherian simple domain with gk dimension 3 n 4 3 4 quantum tori in two variables let a 1 dq k x x 1 y xy qyx a 2 dq k x y y 1 xy qyx and a 3 dq k x x 1 y y 1 xy qyx thus a 1 is generated by x x 1 y a x a y a 1 0 1 a 2 is generated by x y y 1 a x a y a 1 0 1 a 3 is generated by x x 1 y y 1 a x a y a 1 0 1 we first note the following corollary 4 19 there exists an isomorphism of the algebra a 3 and its opposite algebra ao 3 such that the isomorphism restricts to an iso morphism of dq r respectively a 1 and a 2 and its opposite dq r o respectively ao 1 and a o 2 where r k x y xy qyx is the coordinate algebra of the quantum plane proof by section 4 1 and remark 4 3 a 3 dq k t t 1 dq k t t 1 as filtered algebras now use corollary 3 15 to complete the proof let r be the quantum torus k x 1 y 1 xy qyx where q is not a root of unity dq r is generated by the set x x 1 y y 1 a x a y for a 1 0 1 following the same approach as for k x 1 we aim to include the following operators which act as automorphisms on r among the generators using notation from remark 4 1 and in section 4 1 x x iyj 7 qixiyj 1 x x iyj 7 q ixiyj y x iyj 7 qjxiyj 1 y x iyj 7 q jxiyj using the identities y y x y 1 1 x y 1 1 x q 1 1 x 1 x 1 1 x q 1 1 1 x 1 1 x 1 1 y q 1 1 y 1 y 1 1 y q 1 1 1 y 1 1 y 1 we can work with the alternative generating set x x 1 y y 1 x y x 1 x 1 y noetherian algebras of quantum differential operators 35 where x 0 x and y 0 y as described in section 4 1 as this only involves left multiplications we shall for z x 1 y 1 write z for z and thereby view r as a subalgebra of dq r acting by left multiplication let r 1 be the subalgebra generated by x y x and y x and let is a 2 be the quantized weyl algebra as in proof of theorem 4 9 with 1 q q 1 1 there is a surjective homomorphism a 2 r 1 with u 1 7 x u 2 7 y x v 1 7 x and v 2 7 y by 12 theorem 6 5 a 2 is simple so is an isomorphism thus r 1 is simple and right and left noetherian it follows that the localization r 2 of r 1 obtained by inverting x and y is also simple and right and left noetherian let be the k automorphism of r 2 such that x qx x q 1 x y y and y x y x clearly is not inner on r 2 where the units have the form x iyj 0 6 k i j 0 by 15 theorem 1 8 5 the skew laurent polynomial ring r 2 x 1 is simple and it follows since xx qx x x x q 1 x x xy y x and x y x y x x that the k algebra extension r 3 of r 2 gen erated by 1 x is isomorphic to r 2 x 1 finally let be the k automorphism of r 3 such that x x x x y q 1 y y x q y x and x x by similar arguments to those above dq r r 3 y 1 and is simple and right and left noetherian we have thus proved the following theorem 4 20 the algebras a 1 a 2 and a 3 are simple domains which are left and right noetherian 4 3 5 the algebra dq rs n n 3 by proposition 4 2 the algebra dq rs n is the localization of the algebradq r with respect to the ore set s generated by x 1 xs in other words dq rr n s 1 zn as in corollary 4 18 we see that dq rs n is a noetherian simple domain of gk dimension 3 n the contruction of dq rs n for 0 s n was with respect to the matrix of parameters qij notice that the algebra of quantum differential operators correspond to the transpose of the matrix qij is isomorphic to the algebra dq rs n o corollary 4 21 there is an isomorphism dq rn n dq rn n o which restricts to isomorphism from dq rs n to its opposite for every s 0 s n proof the required map dq rn n dq rn n o is given by i ei i o xi ei xi o o 36 iyer and jordan for 1 i n zn 5 the quantum exterior algebra here we consider the multiparameter quantum exterior algebra r in n variables 1 2 n with parameters pij such that pji 1 pij and pii 1 then r k 1 2 n
