the cohomology ring of a finite dimensional hopf algebra is conjectured to be finitely gen erated friedlander and suslin 8 proved this for cocommutative hopf algebras generalizing earlier results of evens 6 golod 10 and venkov 24 for finite group algebras and of fried lander and parshall 7 for restricted lie algebras there are many finite generation results as well for various types of

sarah witherspoon most of these results are in characteristic 0 in this paper we prove finite generation for classes of noncocommutative hopf algebras in prime characteristic p 2 these are some of the pointed hopf algebras arising in classification work of the first two authors our main result is the following combination of theorems 5 1 2 and 5 2 1 below theorem let k be an algebraically closed field of prime characteristic p 2 consider the following hopf algebras over k 1 the p 2 q dimensional bosonization r kg of a rank two nichols algebra r of jordan type over a cyclic group g of order q where q is divisible by p and 2 a lifting h of r kg when p q 3 then the cohomology rings of r kg and of h are finitely generated our theorem is exclusively an odd characteristic result since the nichols algebra of jordan type does not appear in characteristic 2 instead there is another related nichols algebra 4 that will require different techniques part 2 of our main theorem above is only stated for characteristic 3 this is because we use the classification of such hopf algebras from 18 and liftings are only known completely in this case we expect our homological techniques will be able to handle liftings when p 3 once more is known about their structure more specifically we let r kg be a p 2 q dimensional hopf algebra given by the bosoniza tion of a jordan plane as introduced in 4 see section 2 2 below we prove in theo rem 5 1 2 that the cohomology ring of such a hopf algebra r kg that is h r kg k ext r kg k k is finitely generated we also consider liftings h of r kg in the special case p q 3 see section 2 3 below we prove in theorem 5 2 1 that the cohomology ring h h k is finitely generated our techniques for proving the main theorem above rely on the may spectral sequence for the cohomology of a filtered algebra in either setting 1 or 2 we may choose a filtration for which the associated graded algebra is a truncated polynomial ring whose cohomology is straightforward the hard work is in finding some permanent cycles as required to use a spectral sequence lemma that goes back to friedlander and suslin 8 this we do in two ways by constructing two types of resolutions which should be of independent interest the general definitions of the resolutions are not new but we provide here some nontrivial examples with our main theorem as an application the first resolution is the twisted tensor product resolution of 20 recalled in section 3 1 used in section 3 2 and iterated in section 3 3 to obtain a resolution over the bosonization r kg of the nichols algebra r this is used in section 5 1 to prove finite generation of its cohomology the second resolution is the anick resolution 1 explained in section 4 1 with a general result for the anick resolution of a truncated polynomial ring in section 4 2 this anick resolution is used in section 5 2 to prove finite generation of the cohomology of the liftings h we could have chosen to work with just one type of resolution either anick or twisted tensor product for proofs of both parts 1 and 2 of our main theorem above we instead chose to work with both resolutions to illustrate a wider variety of techniques available each having its own advantages 2 settings throughout let k be a field for our main results we will assume that k is algebraically closed field of prime characteristic p 2 since we work with hopf algebras found in classifica tion work under this assumption the tensor product is k unless specified otherwise in cohomology of pointed hopf algebras 3 this section we will define the nichols algebras and pointed hopf algebras that are featured in this paper and summarize some structural results that will be needed 2 1 pointed hopf algebras let h be any finite dimensional pointed hopf algebra over k the coradical the sum of all simple subcoalgebras of h is h 0 kg a hopf subalgebra of h generated by the grouplike elements g g h g g g where is the coproduct on h let h 0 h 1 h 2 h be the coradical filtration of h where hn 1 h hn 1 h 0 h inductively see 17 chapter 5 consider the associated graded hopf algebra grh n 0 hn hn 1 with the convention h 1 0 note that the zero term of grh equals its coradical i e grh 0 h 0 there is a projection grh h 0 and an inclusion h 0 grh such that 1 the identity map on h 0 let r be the algebra of coinvariants of r grh co h grh 1 h h h 1 where 1 h denotes the identity map on h by results of radford 23 and majid 15 r is a hopf algebra in the braided category ggyd of left yetter drinfeld modules over h 0 kg moreover grh is the bosonization or radford biproduct of r and h 0 so that grh r h 0 with the hopf structure given in 17 theorem 10 6 5 as an algebra it is simply the smash product of h 0 with r analogous to a semidirect product of groups 2 2 our setting rank two nichols algebra and its bosonization for sections 3 and 5 1 we use the following setup let k be a field of prime characteristic p 2 let g g z qz be a cyclic group whose order q is divisible by p consider r k x y xp yp yx xy 1 2 x 2 which is a p 2 dimensional algebra as described in 4 theorem 3 5 with a vector space basis xiyj 0 i j p 1 observe that r is the nichols algebra of a rank two yetter drinfeld module v kx ky over g where the g action on v is given by gx x and gy x y here the left superscript indicates group action and the g gradings of x and y are both given by g let r kg be the bosonization of r and kg it is the corresponding p 2 q dimensional pointed hopf algebra as studied in 4 corollary 3 14 18 3 case b and 19 4 its hopf structure is given by x x 1 g x y y 1 g y g g g x 0 y 0 g 1 s x g 1 x s y g 1 y s g g 1 where is the coproduct is the counit and s is the antipode map of r kg remark 2 2 1 we remark the following 1 these r g r kg appear in 4 18 19 for various purposes in their settings g is a cyclic group of order p here we consider a more general setting with g being cyclic of order q divisible by p 4 van c nguyen xingting wang and sarah witherspoon 2 in 18 the first two authors classified p 3 dimensional pointed hopf algebra over prime characteristic p in their classification work this p 2 dimensional nichols algebra r of jordan type is unique up to isomorphism and only occurs when p 2 3 the authors of 4 used right modules in their settings whereas left modules were used in the classification work in 18 thus inducing a sign difference in the relation yx xy 1 2 x 2 of r there here we adopt the relation described in 4 in section 5 2 when we study the cohomology of pointed hopf algebras h lifted from the associated graded algebras grh r kg we modify the relations of the lifting structure given in 18 accordingly see the next section 2 3 2 3 our setting a class of 27 dimensional pointed hopf algebras let k be a field of characteristic p 3 and consider hopf algebras h defined from three scalar pa rameters as in 18 these are pointed hopf algebras of dimension 27 whose associated graded algebra is grh r kg the hopf algebra described in section 2 2 in this case p q 3 as an algebra h is generated by g x y with relations g 3 1 x 3 x y 3 y 2 2 y yg gy xg g g 2 xg gx g g 2 yx xy x 2 x y 1 g 2 where 0 1 and k are arbitrary scalars the coalgebra structure is the same as that of r kg described in section 2 2 by setting w g 1 we get a new presentation in which the generators are w x y and the relations are w 3 0 x 3 x y 3 y 2 2 y yw wy wx x w 2 w xw wx w 2 w yx xy x 2 x y w 2 w this choice of generating set will be convenient for our homological arguments later as shown in 18 h has dimension 27 with vector space basis wixjyk 0 i j k 2 3 twisted tensor product resolutions in this section we apply the construction of twisted tensor product resolutions introduced in 20 to our nichols algebra r and its bosonization r kg that was defined in section 2 2 3 1 the resolution construction let a and b be associative algebras over k with mul tiplication maps ma a a a and mb b b b and multiplicative identities 1 a and 1 b respectively we write 1 for the identity map on any set a twisting map b a a b is a bijective k linear map for which 1 b a a 1 b and b 1 a 1 a b for all a a and b b and 3 1 1 mb ma ma mb 1 1 1 1 as maps b b a a a b the twisted tensor product algebra a b is the vector space a b together with multiplication m given by such a twisting map that is m a b a b a b is given by m ma mb 1 1 cohomology of pointed hopf algebras 5 definition 3 1 2 20 definition 5 1 let m be an a module with module structure map a m a m m we say m is compatible with the twisting map if there is a bijective k linear map b m b m m b such that b m mb 1 1 mb b m 1 1 b m and 3 1 3 b m 1 a m a m 1 1 b m 1 3 1 4 as maps on b b m and on b a m respectively letm be an a module that is compatible with we say a projective a module resolution p q m of m is compatible with the twisting map if each module pi m is compatible with via maps b i for which b q b p q m p q m b is a k linear chain map lifting b m b m m b let n be a b module and let p q n be a projective resolution of n over b we put an a b module structure on the bicomplex p q m p q n by using maps b q under such compatibility conditions the twisted tensor product resolutions for left mod ules over a b were constructed in 20 satisfying the following theorem theorem 3 1 5 20 theorem 5 12 let a and b be k algebras with twisting map b a a b let p q m be an a projective resolution of m and p q n be a b projective resolution of n assume a m and p q m are compatible with and b yi j pi m pj n is a projective a b module for all i j then the twisted tensor product complex y q tot p q m p q n with yn i j n pi m pj n is a projective resolution of m n as a module over the twisted tensor product a b by tot p q m p q n we mean the total complex of the bicomplex p q m p q n that is the complex whose nth component is yn i j n pi m pj n and differential is dn i j n dij where dij di 1 1 i 1 dj in the statement of 20 theorem 5 12 we have replaced one of the hypotheses by our hypothesis b above and in this case the proof is given by 20 lemmas 5 8 and 5 9 in some contexts such as ours here the hypothesis b can be checked directly in which case this version of the theorem is sufficient for the rest of this section let r g be as defined in section 2 2 let k also denote the trivial left r or r kg module that is the field k with action given by the augmentation x 0 y 0 g 1 we will construct a resolution of k as an r module via a twisted tensor product and as an r kg module by iterating the twisted product construction 3 2 resolution over the nichols algebra r let k be a field of characteristic p 2 and let r be the nichols algebra described in section 2 2 let k be the r module on which x and y both act as 0 we start with a construction of a resolution of k as an r module using the relation 3 9 in 4 lemma 3 8 we can view r as the twisted tensor product r k x y xp yp yx xy 1 2 x 2 a b 6 van c nguyen xingting wang and sarah witherspoon where a k x xp b k y yp the twisting map b a a b is defined by yr x r t 0 r t 1 2 t t x t yr t where we use the convention t 1 2 t 1 with 0 1 for any consider the following free resolutions of k as a module and as b module respectively p q a xp 1 a x a xp 1 a x a k 0 p q b yp 1 b y b yp 1 b y b k 0 the map on a respectively on b takes x to 0 respectively y to 0 consider the tensor product p q a p q b as a graded vector space the total complex is a complex of vector spaces with differential in degree n given by dn i j n di 1 1 i dj we will put the structure of an r module on each pi a pj b so that this tensor product complex is an r projective resolution of k as an r module this will follow from 20 lemmas 5 8 and 5 9 once we define a chain map as in definition 3 1 2 and check that the resulting r modules are indeed projective that is as in definition 3 1 2 there are bijective k linear maps b i that we abbreviate here as i for which the diagram 1 xp 1 b a 3 1 x b a 2 1 xp 1 b a 1 1 x b a 0 1 b k 0 xp 1 1 a b x 1 a b xp 1 1 a b x 1 a b 1 k b 0 commutes and conditions 3 1 3 and 3 1 4 hold we claim that the following maps i satisfy the above conditions lemma 3 2 1 for any integer i 0 let i b a a b be defined as follows i y r x yr x i is even r t 0 r t 1 2 t 1 t x t yr t i is odd then a i is a bijective k linear map whose inverse is 1 i x yr r t 0 r t 1 2 t t yr t x t i is even r t 0 r t 1 2 t 1 t yr t x t i is odd cohomology of pointed hopf algebras 7 b i satisfies conditions 3 1 3 and 3 1 4 in particular i mb 1 1 mb i 1 1 i and i 1 ma ma 1 1 i 1 as maps on b b a and on b a a respectively c each square in the above diagram commutes consequently k and its resolution p q a are compatible with proof let i be defined as in the lemma a bijection to show i is bijective with the given inverse it suffices to show that i 1 i 1 a b and 1 i i 1 b a here we will check i 1 i 1 a b for the case when i is odd the remaining case is similar i 1 i x yr i r k 0 r k 1 2 k 1 k yr k x k r k 0 r k 1 2 k 1 k r k s 0 r k s 1 2 s k 1 s x k s yr k s r k 0 r k s 0 r k r k s 1 2 k 1 2 s 1 k k 1 s x k s yr k s r t 0 k s t r k r k s 1

that the maps i satisfy conditions 3 1 3 and 3 1 4 observe that if i is 0 or even then both conditions hold from the definition of as i in this case and satisfies 3 1 1 it remains to check the case when i is odd 8 van c nguyen xingting wang and sarah witherspoon let us verify 3 1 3 first on b b a the left hand side is i mb 1 y r 1 yr 2 x i y r 1 r 2 x r 1 r 2 t 0 r 1 r 2 t 1 2 t 1 t x t yr 1 r 2

pointed hopf algebras 11 by theorem 3 1 5 the total complex k q tot p q a p q b is a free resolution of k as a b module for each i j 0 let i j denote the free generator 1 1 of pi a pj b as an a b module then as an r module kn i j n r i j recall that the differentials of this total complex are dn i j n di 1 1 i dj as pi a pj b is free as an a b module with generator i j we can write the image of i j under the differential map as the action of a b on i j using values of the inverse map 1 defined in 3 2 3 where needed we express the differential on elements via this notation d i j xp 1 i 1 j

i or j is negative 3 3 resolution over the bosonization r kg again we take k to be a field of charac teristic p 2 and r g as described in section 2 2 for the group g g z qz where q is divisible by p we define an action of g on the r complex k q constructed in section 3 2 for the purpose of forming a twisted tensor product resolution of k q with a resolution of k as kg module the group action will give us a twisting map on the complex k q analogous to the twisting map defining a skew group algebra the resulting complex will give us a resolution of k over the bosonization r kg let r a b be the twisted tensor product with a k x x p b k y yp and b a a b as defined before under our setting in characteristic p 2 and relation yx xy 1 2 x 2 in r we obtain the following relations in r here we drop the tensor symbols and write xy in place of x y in r proposition 3 3 1 the following relations hold in r 1 for any integer 0 yx x y 2 x 1 2 for any integer n 1 x y n n i 0 n i i 1 2 i xiyn i proof 1 this was shown right after 4 lemma 3 8 we provide the proof here for com pleteness we proceed by induction on case 0 is trivial case 1 is from the relation yx xy 1 2 x 2 now assume the statement holds

by the action of g on kn so that i j g i j i j g if i is odd i j i 1 j 1 g if i is even and j is odd i j i 1 j 1 g if i j are even then k q is compatible with giving the twisting that governs the

freely generated by some i j k where k denotes the free generator for pk kg kg so by theorem 3 1 5 y q is a free resolution of the r kg module k cohomology of pointed hopf algebras 17 for each i j k 0 let i j k denote the free generator i j k of ki j pk kg as an r kg module we set i j k 0 if one of i j k is negative then for all n 0 as an r kg module yn i j k n r kg i j k we express the

divides q among these differentials of free r kg module basis elements the only terms in the outcomes d i j k that do not have coefficients in the aug mentation ideal ker are the terms g i 1 j 1 k 1

section we recall the anick resolution and make some additional observations about it in our setting we will use the anick resolution in section 5 2 4 1 the resolution construction we generally construct the anick resolution 1 as envisioned by cojocaru and ufnarovski 5 adapted here to left modules under some condi tions an algorithmic description using gro bner bases is given by green and solberg 12 the construction of the resolution also serves as a proof of exactness since the differentials are defined recursively in each degree making use of a contracting homotopy in the previous degree that is constructed recursively as well see theorem 4 1 2 below due to anick we include a proof in our setting because we will use the construction in sections 4 2 and 5 2 let a t v i where v is a finite dimensional vector space t v t k v is the tensor algebra on v over k and i is a set of relations generating an ideal i we denote the image of an element v of v in a also by v when it will cause no confusion we assume that a is augmented by an algebra homomorphism a k with v 0 for all v v fix a totally ordered basis v 1 vn of v say v 1 vn and consider the degree lexicographic ordering on words in v 1 vn that is we give each vi the degree 1 and monomials words are ordered first according to total degree then monomials having the same degree i e word length are ordered as in a dictionary a normal word called an element of an order ideal of monomials or o i m in 1 is a monomial considered as an element of t v that cannot be written as a linear combination cohomology of pointed hopf algebras 19 of smaller words in a as a vector space a has a basis in one to one correspondence with the set of normal words a tip called an obstruction in 1 is a word considered as an element in t v that is not normal but for which any proper subword is normal it follows that the tips correspond to the relations let u be a tip and write the image of u in a as a linear combination u aiti where each ti is a normal word and ai is a scalar then viewed as an element of t v u aiti is in the ideal of relations i it also follows that the tips are in one to one correspondence with a gro bner basis of i 12 we construct the anick resolution from the chosen sets of generators and relations in a as follows we reindex in comparison to 1 so that indices for spaces correspond to homological degrees and indices for functions correspond to homological degrees of their domains the anick resolution is a free resolution of k considered to be an a module under the augmentation we will first describe a free basis cn in each homological degree n of the resolution we will write the resolution as d 3 a kc 2 d 2 a kc 1 d 1 a k 0 where kcn denotes the vector space with basis cn we adapt the degree lexicographic ordering on monomials in t v to each a module a kcn by giving an element s t where s is a normal word and t cn the degree of st viewed as an element of t v let c 1 v 1 vn that is c 1 is the chosen set of generators let c 2 be the set of tips or obstructions the remaining sets cn will be defined as sets of paths of length n in a directed graph or quiver associated to the generators and tips as follows 5 the graph will have at most one directed arrow joining two vertices and paths will be denoted by the product of their vertices in t v written from right to left for example if f g are vertices and there is an arrow from f to g we denote the arrow by gf and if there is a further arrow from g to h then hgf denotes the path f g h starting at f passing through g and ending at h let b v 1 vn be a basis of v equipped with the ordering v 1 vn as above so that we may identify b with c 1 let t be the set of tips let r be the set of all proper prefixes that is left factors of the tips considered as elements of t v note that b r let q q b t be the following quiver the vertex set is 1 r the arrows are all 1 vi for vi b and all f g for which the word gf viewed as an element of t v uniquely contains a tip and that tip is a prefix possibly coinciding with gf the set cn consists of all paths of length n starting from 1 in the quiver in this context the path 1 f g is identified with the product gf note that f g does not occur on its own as an element of any ci if f 6 1 so for our purposes there will be no confusion in denoting paths this way for use in constructing the chains cn we observe that we only use the vertices that are in the connected component of q containing 1 let q q b t be the connected component of 1 in q called the reduced quiver of b and t 20 van c nguyen xingting wang and sarah witherspoon the differentials d are defined recursively with a simultaneous recursive definition of a k linear contracting homotopy s 4 1 1 d 3 a kc 2 s 2 oo d 2 a kc 1 s 1 oo d 1 a s 0 oo k oo 0 where is the unit map taking the multiplicative identity of k to the multiplicative identity of a we give these definitions next in our setting simultaneously proving the following theorem examples are given in 1 5 and below in sections 4 2 and 5 2 theorem 4 1 2 1 theorem 1 4 there are maps dn sn for which a kc q d q is a free resolution of k as an a module and s q is a contracting homotopy proof we first define the maps dn sn 1 for n 1 2 to illustrate the general method we then use induction on n degree 1 we take n 1 and let d 1 1 vi vi for all vi in b and extend d 1 so that it is a left a module homomorphism to define the k linear map s 0 a a kc 1 first write elements of a as k linear combinations of normal words which form the chosen vector space basis of a define s 0 on a via its values on all normal words which are as follows set s 0 1 0 and s 0 uvi u vi for all normal words of the form uvi for some word u and vi in b extend s 0 so that it is a k linear map on a and note that it will not be an a module homomorphism in general we now see that by construction a d 1 s 0 a for all a a it also follows that a kc 1 ker d 1 im s 0 to see this let b a kc 1 and write b b s 0 d 1 b s 0 d 1 b one checks that b s 0 d 1 b ker d 1 by definition s 0 d 1 b im s 0 the intersection of these two spaces is 0 by the above equation and definitions if b ker d 1 im s 0 write b s 0 c then c d 1 s 0 c c which implies c k so that b s 0 c 0 degree 2 we take n 2 and define d 2 1 u for u in c 2 as follows by definition of c 2 we may write u rvi uniquely in t v for a word r in r and vi c 1 consider r vi as an element of a kc 1 and further take its image under the a module homomorphism d 1 d 1 r vi rd 1 1 vi rvi define d 2 1 u r vi s 0 d 1 r vi r vi s 0 rvi and extend d 2 so that it is an a module homomorphism on a kc 2 by its definition rvi when considered as an element of t v is a tip not a normal word and considered here as an element of a it must be rewritten as a k linear combination of normal words before applying s 0 since s 0 is a k linear map but not an a module homomorphism now the definitions of d 1 and s 0 imply d 1 s 0 ker 1 ker the identity map on ker it also follows that d 1 d 2 0 we wish to define s 1 so that d 2 s 1 ker d 1 1 ker d 1 and more generally so that d 2 s 1 s 0 d 1 1 a kc 1 cohomology of pointed hopf algebras 21 first define s 1 on elements in ker d 1 by induction on their degrees starting with those that are least in the ordering which are elements of a kc 1 corresponding to relations ordering the elements of c 2 as u 1 u with u 1 least we define s 1 d 2 1 u 1 1 u 1 recall that we have chosen a total order on a vector space basis of a kc 1 given by elements r vi where r is a normal word and vi b to coincide with the order on the corresponding words rvi in t v assume s 1 has been defined on elements of ker d 1 with highest term of degree i e position in the total order less than n let m j 1 aijrij vij ker d 1 for some nonzero aij k rij a with vi 1 vim distinct elements of b and terms ordered so that ri 1 vi 1 is greatest and has degree n since d 1 aijrij vij 0 in a by assumption and ri 1 vi 1 is greatest the monomial ri 1 vi 1 in t v must contain a tip since ri 1 is a nonzero normal word the tip must be a suffix that is right factor of ri 1 vi 1 say ri 1 vi 1 v u in t v with u a tip since u is a tip there is an element in the ideal i of the form u k 1 bktk for some normal words tk and scalars bk write each tk t kvik for words t k set k 1 ai 1 bkv t k vik m j 2 aijrij vij and s 1 m j 1 aijrij vij ai 1 v u s 1 note that consists of terms of lower degree than ri 1 vi 1 and ker d 1 by construction so we may now apply the induction hypothesis to define s 1 recall that a kc 1 ker d 1 im s 0 we define s 1 on im s 0 to be 0 we claim that by these definitions d 2 s 1 s 0 d 1 1 a kc 1 to see this we check separately for elements of ker d 1 and of im s 0 if x m j 1 aijrij vij ker d 1 as above then by the inductive definition of s 1 we have d 2 s 1 s 0 d 1 x d 2 s 1 x x if x im s 0 then d 2 s 1 s 0 d 1 x s 0 d 1 x x since d 1 s 0 1 a it follows that a kc 2 ker d 2 im s 1 if b a kc 2 then b b s 1 d 2 b s 1 d 2 b with b s 1 d 2 b in ker d 2 and s 1 d 2 b in im s 1 if b ker d 2 im s 1 write b s 1 c and we have c d 2 s 1 s 0 d 1 c s 0 d 1 c then b s 1 c s 1 s 0 d 1 c 0 since s 1 s 0 0 by definition of s 1 degree at least 3 we take n 3 and assume that a module homomorphisms d 1 dn 1 and k linear maps s 0 sn 2 have been defined so that di 1 di 0 si 1 si 2 0 and disi 1 si 2 di 1 1 a kci 1 for 1 i n 1 it follows by an argument similar to the above that a kci ker di im si 1 for all 1 i n 1 in particular a kcn 1 ker dn 1 im sn 2 we will define dn and sn 1 the map dn is defined first as follows let u cn we may write uniquely u ru for u cn 1 and r in r by construction of the quiver q let 4 1 3 dn 1 u r u sn 2 dn 1 r u now dn 1 r u rdn 1 1 u since dn 1 is an a module homomorphism and in order to apply sn 2 to this element of a kcn 2 any elements of a will need to be rewritten as linear combinations of normal words before applying sn 2 since sn 2 is k linear but not an 22 van c nguyen xingting wang and sarah witherspoon a module homomorphism in general it follows directly from the definition of dn and the induction hypothesis that dn 1 dn 0 we wish to define sn 1 so that dnsn 1 ker dn 1 1 ker dn 1 and more generally so that dnsn 1 sn 2 dn 1 1 a kcn 1 the map sn 1 is defined inductively as follows let m i 1 airi ui ker dn 1 for some ai k normal words ri a and ui cn 1 recall that we have chosen a total order on a vector space basis of a kcn 1 given by elements r u where r is a normal word and u cn 1 to coincide with the order on the corresponding words ru in t v we may assume r 1 u 1 is the highest term among all ri ui write u 1 u u uniquely where u cn 2 then by definition of dn 1 replacing n by n 1 in equation 4 1 3 we have 0 dn 1 m i 1 airi ui a 1 r 1 u u where sn 3 dn 2 a 1 r 1 u u dn 1 m i 2 airi ui and when the term dn 1 airi ui is expanded due to cancellation the resulting expression for consists of terms lower in the order than r 1 u 1 since 0 a 1 r 1 u u considering r 1 u as a word in t v there is a tip v that is a factor of r 1 u in t v to make a unique choice of such a tip write r 1 vj 1 vj as a word in the letters in b now u is not a tip but r 1 u contains a tip and so there is a largest k k for which vjk vj u uniquely contains a tip and by construction this tip will then be a prefix thus we may write uniquely r 1 u v tu where t r and tu uniquely contains a tip that is a prefix so there is an arrow u t in the reduced quiver q by definition therefore tu 1 tu u cn we may thus set 4 1 4 sn 1 m i 1 airi ui a 1 v tu 1 sn 1 where m i 1 airi ui dn a 1 v tu 1 has highest term that is lower in the order than r 1 u 1 to obtain the above expression in the argument airi ui of sn 1 we have added and subtracted dn a 1 v tu 1 now continue in the same fashion to obtain sn 1 in terms of elements lower in the total order and so on since the chosen basis of a kcn 1 is well ordered we will eventually reach an expression involving sn 1 0 0 as before we define sn 1 on im sn 2 to be 0 so that sn 1 sn 2 0 a calculation as before now shows that dnsn 1 sn 2 dn 1 1 a kcn 1 now by its definition and the above arguments s q is a contracting homotopy for the com plex 4 1 1 implying that the complex is exact and therefore a kc q d q is a free resolution of k as an a module 4 2 a truncated polynomial ring in this section we let k be any field and m 1 m 2 m 3 be positive integers at least 2 we look closely at the anick resolution for the algebra a k w x y wm 1 xm 2 ym 3 which will be used in the next section for this purpose choose generating set b w x y and relations 4 2 1 i wm 1 xm 2 ym 3 wx xw wy yw xy yx cohomology of pointed hopf algebras 23 then a has basis wixjyk 0 i m 1 1 0 j m 2 1 0 k m 3 1 we choose the ordering w x y so for example the degree lex ordering on basis elements in degrees 0 1 2 is 1 w x y w 2 wx wy x 2 xy y 2 note that xy is a normal word while yx is a tip or obstruction generally the normal words correspond to the pbw basis of a and the tips are t wm 1 xm 2 ym 3 xw yw yx the proper prefixes of the tips are r wi xj yk 0 i m 1 1 0 j m 2 1 0 k m 3 1 the corresponding reduced quiver q as defined in section 4 1 is as follows the nonre duced quiver q contains additional vertices and arrows if m 3 but we will not need this here if m 1 2 the vertices w and w m 1 1 are identified and there is a loop at that vertex similarly for m 2 m 3 1 vv w x y wm 1 1 ii 66 33 xm 2 1 hh 66 ym 3 1 jj we have c 1 w x y c 2 w m 1 xm 2 ym 3 xw yw yx c 3 w m 1 1 xm 2 1 ym 3 1 xwm 1 ywm 1 yxm 2 xm 2 w ym 3 w ym 3 x yxw and similarly we may find cn for n 3 a free basis of cn is all 1 u where u is a path of length n starting at 1 in the above reduced quiver q fix such a free basis element 1 u suppose n i j k and the first i vertices in the path u are in the set w wm 1 1 the second j vertices of u are in the set x xm 2 1 and the third k vertices are in the set y ym 3 1 write u ui j k and note that the triple of indices i j k uniquely determines the path for convenience we set c 0 1 and u 000 1 identifying a with a kc 0 we set uijk 0 if i j or k is negative lemma 4 2 2 let a k w x y wm 1 xm 2 ym 3 and let p q denote the anick resolution of a with respect to the chosen generators w x y and relations 4 2 1 then dn 1 uijk y 3 k ui j k 1 1 kx 2 j ui j 1 k 1 j kw 1 i ui 1 j k where n i j k and a 1 if is odd ma 1 if is even proof we will prove the formula for dn by induction on n by definition d 1 1 u 100 w u 000 d 1 1 u 010 y u 000 and d 1 1 u 001 x u 000 and these values agree with the claimed formula for d 1 24 van c nguyen xingting wang and sarah witherspoon assume the formula holds for dn 1 we first consider the case j k 0 and i 0 dn 1 ui 00 w 1 i ui 1

next consider the case k 0 and j 0 applying the construction of sn 2 described in the proof of theorem 4 1 2 the vertex x 2 j is last in the path uij 0 so by induction dn 1 uij 0 x 2 j ui j 1 0 sn 2 dn 1 x 2 j ui j 1 0 x 2 j ui j 1 0 sn 2 1 j 1 w 1 i x 2 j ui 1 j 1 0 x 2 j ui j 1 0 1 jw 1 i ui 1 j 0 since x 2 j x 2 j 1 0 in a this agrees with the stated formula for dn in case k 0 since the vertex labeled y 3 k is the last in the path uijk by induction since y 3 k y 3 k 1 0 dn 1 uijk y 3 k ui j k 1 sn 2 dn 1 y 3 k ui j k 1 y 3 k ui j k 1 sn 2 y 3 k 1 k 1 x 2 j ui j 1 k 1 1 j k 1 w 1 i ui 1 j k

sign these terms have the same total degree since each arises via an application to ui j k of some differential maps that do not change total degree thus we must compare them lexicographically and we see that x 2 j y 3 k ui j 1 k 1 is the higher of the two terms the first step of applying sn 2 thus involves the term x 2 j ui j 1 k corresponding to this expression as the first term on the right side of equation 4 1 4 continuing by working inductively with appropriate signs we obtain y 3 k ui j k 1 1 kx 2 j ui j 1 k 1 j kw 1 i ui 1 j k as desired next we show that the anick resolution is isomorphic to a twisted tensor product resolution for this small example lemma 4 2 3 let a k w x y wm 1 xm 2 ym 3 the anick resolution p q for a is equiv alent to the total complex k q of the tensor

p aw be the following free resolution of k as an a module p aw wm 1 1 aw w aw wm 1 1 aw w aw k 0 let p ax and p ay be similar free resolutions of k as an ax module and as an ay module respectively let k q tot p ay p ax p aw be the total complex of the tensor product of these three complexes let denote the differential on p q cohomology of pointed hopf algebras 25 we will show that pn kn as an a module for each n and that such isomorphisms may be chosen so as to constitute a chain map between p q and k q we will prove this by induction on n beginning with n 0 and n 1 for n 0 note that p 0 a ay ax aw k 0 and each maps onto k via we take 0 to be this isomorphism for n 1 note that p 1 a k w x y while k 1 is equal to p ay 1 p ax 0 p aw 0 p ay 0 p ax 1 p aw 0 p ay 0 p ax 0 p aw 1 to keep

ijk y 3 k i j k 1 1 kx 2 j i j 1 k 1 j kw 1 i i 1 j k comparing with lemma 4 2 3 we see that q is a chain map 5 finite generation of some cohomology rings we now apply the constructions of twisted tensor product and anick resolutions discussed in sections 3 and 4 to prove that the cohomology rings of the hopf algebras in our settings see sections 2 2 and 2 3 are finitely generated 5 1 cohomology of the nichols algebra and its bosonization let r g be defined as in section 2 2 recall that we have used a twisted tensor product to construct a resolution k q for k as an r module in section 3 2 and further to construct a resolution y q for k as a module over the bosonization r kg in section 3 3 by examining the expression for the cohomology h 2 r kg k given at the end of sec tion 3 3 we see that it includes nonzero elements represented by the 2 cocycles 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 we find their cup products which will be used in the proof of theorem 5 1 2 below to simplify notation let x 2 0 0 y 0 2 0 g 0 0 2 using the projectivity of the resolution y q one can show that these functions may be extended to chain maps on y q as follows x i j k i 2 j k y i j k i j 2 k g i j k i j k 2 for all i j k where we set i j k 0 if any one of i j k is negative consequently x y g are generators of a polynomial subalgebra k x y g of h r kg k in even degrees for example the above formulas can be used to show that 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 and 2 0 0 0 2 0 2 2 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 and generally if i j k i j k are all even then i j k i j k i i j j k k 26 van c nguyen xingting wang and sarah witherspoon we will also need the following lemma which is 14 lemma 2 5 as adapted from 8 lemma 1 6 lemma 5 1 1 let e p q 1 e p q be a multiplicative spectral sequence of k algebras concentrated in the half plane p q 0 and let b be a bigraded commutative k algebra concentrated in even total degrees assume that there exists a bigraded map of algebras from b to e 1 such that the image of b consists of permanent cycles and e 1 is a noetherian module over the image of b then e is a noetherian module over tot b we are now ready to prove our first main theorem theorem 5 1 2 let r k x y xp yp yx xy 1 2 x 2 be the nichols algebra defined over a field k of prime characteristic p 2 and g g be a cyclic group of order q divisible by p acting on r by automorphisms with gx x and gy x y then the cohomology ring of the bosonization h r kg k is finitely generated proof without loss of generality we may assume that q pa for some a to see this note that g z paz z z for some coprime to p and some a 1 elements of the subgroup of g that is isomorphic to z z act trivially on r since their orders are coprime to p and so r kg r kz paz kz z as an algebra thus the cohomology of r kg is the graded tensor product of the cohomology of r kz paz and of kz z the cohomology of kz z is concentrated in degree 0 where it is simply k since is coprime to p now assume that q pa let w g 1 and note that since the order of g is q r kg k w x y w q xp yp yx xy 1 2 x 2 xw wx yw wy wx x assign the degree lexicographic order on monomials in w x y with w x y this gives rise to an n filtration on r kg for which the associated graded algebra gr r kg k w x y wq xp yp see e g 2 theorem 4 6 5 we will apply the may spectral sequence 16 in our context for which e 1 h gr r kg k e grh r kg k the algebra gr r kg k w x y wq xp yp has a resolution given by a tensor prod uct as in lemma 4 2 3 equivalently by repeating the twisted tensor product construction in section 3 3 but with trivial twisting we find that there are elements in degree 2 of h gr r kg k corresponding to w x y h 2 r kg k here we identify w g and we use the same notation for them by abuse of notation these elements are permanent cycles in the may spectral sequence we have already seen that these cocycles exist for the filtered algebra r kg as constructed in section 3 3 they are permanent cocycles as we may identify their images with the corresponding elements of h r kg k specifically let b k w x y by identifying h gr r kg k with group coho mology or by arguments in 14 section 4 we see that e 1 h gr r kg k is a noetherian b module it is generated over b by some elements w x y in degree 1 by lemma 5 1 1 e grh r kg k is a noetherian module over k w x y by an appropriate zariskian filtration 13 chapter 2 one can lift information from the associ ated graded ring to the filtered ring thus h r kg k is noetherian over k w x y therefore by 6 proposition 2 4 h r kg k is finitely generated as an algebra remark 5 1 3 there is a different proof of theorem 5 1 2 that is closer to evens original proof of finite generation of group cohomology see 19 theorem 3 1 section 5 and erratum for details cohomology of pointed hopf algebras 27 5 2 cohomology of some pointed hopf algebras of dimension 27 in this section we let k be a field of characteristic p 3 and consider the hopf algebras h defined in section 2 3 consider k to be the h module on which w x y each act as 0 theorem 5 2 1 let h be a hopf algebra of dimension 27 over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p 3 as defined in section 2 3 the cohomology h h k is finitely generated proof choose the ordering w x y as before and the corresponding degree lexicographic ordering on monomials due to the form of the relations this gives rise to an n filtration on h for which the associated graded algebra is grh k w x y w 3 x 3 y 3 see e g 2 theorem 4 6 5 we consider the anick resolution p q for h filtered correspondingly and the resulting may spectral sequence of the complex homh p q k this is a multiplicative spectral sequence under the product induced by a diagonal map p q p q p q lifting the identity map on k note that the associated graded resolution to p q is grp q which we may identify with the anick resolution for grh described in lemma 4 2 3 the anick resolution for a h has the same free basis sets cn as that for grh described in section 4 2 direct calculations show that it has the following differentials in degrees 2 and 3 recall that the parameter only takes the values 0 or 1 by the proof of theorem 4 1 2 values of d 2 on tips correspond to the relations specifically d 2 1 w 3 w 2 w d 2 1 x 3 x 2 x x d 2 1 y 3 y 2 y y y 2 y d 2 1 xw x w w x w w w d 2 1 yw y w w y w x 1 x w w w d 2 1 yx y x x y x x x y w w w values of d 3 require some computation using the algorithm outlined as part of the proof of theorem 4 1 2 and on free basis elements they are d 3 1 w 4 w w 3 d 3 1 x 4 x x 3 d 3 1 y 4 y y 3 d 3 1 xw 3 x w 3 w 2 xw d 3 1 x 3 w x

3 1 yx 3 y x 3 x 2 yx wx xw x yx x xw w xw d 3 1 y 3 x y 2 yx x y 3 xy yx wx yw wy yw w 2 yx wx xw w 2 yw w 2 xw y yx y yw x yx x xw w yx w yw w xw 28 van c nguyen xingting wang and sarah witherspoon for example to find d 3 1 yw 3 we first compute d 3 1 yw 3 y w 3 s 1 d 2 y w 3 y w 3 s 1 yw 2 w now using the relations rewrite yw 2 as w 2 y w 2 x wx w 2 w so that the above expression is y w 3 s 1 w 2 y w w 2 x w wx w w 2 w w w now d 2 w 2 yw w 2 y w w 2 x w 2 w and adding and subtracting w 2 x w 2 w the above may be rewritten as y w 3 s 1 w 2 y w w 2 x w 2 w w 2 x w 2 w w 2 x w wx w w 2 w w w y w 3 w 2 yw s 1 w 2 x w 2 x w wx w w 2 w w w for the next two steps we note that d 2 w 2 xw w 2 x w w 2 w and d 2 w xw wx w w 2 x w 2 w w w and so the above may be rewritten as y w 3 w 2 yw s 1 w 2 x w 2 x w w 2 w w 2 w wx w w w y w 3 w 2 yw w 2 xw s 1 w 2 x wx w w 2 w w w we recognize the argument of s 1 above as d 2 w xw and so we obtain the value of d 3 1 yw 3 as claimed looking at the values of d 3 given above note that the coefficients in the factor a h of a kc 2 in the image of each of these free basis elements under d 3 are in the augmentation ideal a similar statement does not apply to d 2 in particular letting w 3 denote elements in the dual basis in hom k kc 2 k homa a kc 2 k where a h to the tips w 3 of kc 2 it follows that d 3 w 3 0 d 3 x 3 0 d 3 y 3 0 setting w w 3 x x 3 y y 3 we see that these functions are cocycles in hom k kc 2 k homa a kc 2 k it follows from the above observations that w x y are permanent cocycles in the may spectral sequence and we may use them in an application of lemma 5 1 1 on the e 1 page w x y correspond to analogous 2 cocycles on grh that generate a polynomial subalgebra of its cohomology ring by a similar analysis to that in earlier sections that is by lemma 4 2 3 the anick resolution is essentially the same as the twisted tensor product resolution used earlier now let b k w x y let w w x x y y in hom k kc 1 k homa a kc 1 k the cohomology of grh is finitely generated as a module over b by w x y and their products note 2 w 0 2 x 0 2 y 0 so these products constitute a finite set by lemma 5 1 1 using an appropriate zariskian filtration 13 chapter 2 the cohomology h h k is noetherian over k w x y by 6 propostion 2 4 it is finitely as an algebra remark 5 2 2 an alternative proof of our earlier theorem 5 1 2 would proceed just as our above proof of theorem 5 2 1 one could compute the differentials on the anick resolution of the algebra there to show existence of the needed elements w x y we chose instead to use the twisted tensor product construction for which we were able to give formulas for the differentials in all degrees yielding a more explicit if not shorter presentation cohomology of pointed hopf
