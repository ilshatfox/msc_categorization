theory of perturbatively quantized general relativity coupled to spinor electrody namics provide the results thereof and set the notation to serve as a starting point for further research in this direction it includes the differential geometric and hopf algebraic background as well as the corresponding lagrange density and some renormalization theory then a particular problem in the renormalization of quantum general relativity coupled to quantum electrodynamics is addressed and solved by a generalization of furry s theo rem next the restricted combinatorial green s functions for all two loop propagators and all one loop divergent subgraphs thereof are presented finally relations between these one loop restricted combinatorial green s functions necessary for multiplicative renormalization are discussed keywords quantum field theory quantum gravity quantum general relativity quantum electrodynamics perturbative quantization hopf algebraic renormalization 1 introduction the theory of general relativity gr and quantum field theory qft are the two great achievements of physics in the 20 th century gr on the one side describes nature on very large scales when huge masses are involved qft on the other side describes nature on very small scales when tiny masses are involved being very successful in their regimes there are situations when both conditions appear at the same time i e when huge masses are compressed into small scales for example this situation occurs in models of the big bang and in models of black holes for these situations a theory of quantum gravity qg is needed to understand nature in particular a theory of qg should be able to clarify how the universe emerged i e through a big bang or otherwise therefore it was soon tried to apply the usual techniques of perturbative qft to the dynamical part of the metric in spacetimes of gr 2 these works in 2 called the covariant line of research were started by m fierz w pauli and l rosenfeld in the 1930 s then r feynman 3 and b dewitt 4 5 6 7 calculated feynman rules of gr in the 1960 s next d boulware s deser p van nieuwenhuizen 8 and g t hooft 9 and m veltman 10 found evidence of the non renormalizability of quantum general relativity qgr in the 1970 s we stress that by qgr we mean a quantization of gr using qft methods whereas by qg we mean any theory of quantized gravitation such as e g loop quantum gravity string theory or supergravity in this article we continue the work on perturbative qgr as started by d kreimer in the 2000 s 11 12 d kreimer used the modern techniques of hopf algebraic renormalization developed by a connes and himself in the 1990 s and 2000 s 13 14 15 16 17 department of mathematics and department of physics at humboldt university of berlin and max planck

situations were studied in the so called core hopf algebra by d kreimer and w d van suijlekom in the 2000 s 18 19 we start this article in section 2 with the differential geometric background needed to understand the lagrange density of quantum general relativity coupled to quantum electrodynamics qgr qed then we introduce the lagrange density of qgr qed lqgr qed 1 2 2 r 1 4 e 2 g g f f i u 1 m m dvg lgf lghost 1 which consists of the usual einstein hilbert lagrange density the canonical generalization of the maxwell dirac lagrange density to curved spacetimes and the gauge fixing and ghost lagrange densities finally the lagrange density of qgr qed is discussed in detail then in section 3 we introduce hopf algebras in general and the connes kreimer renormalization hopf algebra in particular next we discuss a problem which can occur when associating the connes kreimer renormalization hopf algebra to a given local qft as we remark this problem occurs already in qed and in particular in qgr qed more concretely there can exist divergent feynman graphs whose residue is not in the residue set of the given local qft thus there are no vertex residues in the theory present which are able to absorb the corresponding divergences then we present four different solutions to this problem in solutions 3 36 3 37 3 38 and 3 39 and discuss their physical interpretation we proceed by analyzing the structure of hopf ideals in the renormalization hopf algebra which represent the symmetries compatible with renormalization then we define the hopf algebra of qgr qed therefore we formulate and prove a generalization of furry s theorem in theorem 3 55 which holds also for amplitudes with an arbitrary number of external gravitons this is in particular useful since at least for the calculations done in the realm of this article these are the only feynman graphs which need to be set to zero when constructing the renormalization hopf algebra of qgr qed besides from pure self loop feynman graphs which vanish for kinematic renormalization schemes finally in section 4 we present all one and two loop propagator graphs and all one loop three point graphs then we present their coproduct structure for which the coproduct of 155 feynman graphs has been computed using these relations we discuss the obstructions to multiplicative renormalizability of qgr qed which results in a generalization of ward takahashi and slavnov taylor identities 20 21 22 23 24 1 finally we give an outlook in section 5 we remark that the feynman graphs were generated in two steps first the corresponding scalar unlabeled feynman graphs were created using 25 and then the feynman graphs were labeled with particle labels from qgr qed using several python programs written by the author 26 cf 1 appendix a then the feynman diagrams were drawn with jaxodraw 27 28 2 differential geometry and the lagrange density of qgr qed we start with the differential geometric background and the lagrange density of qgr qed throughout this article we use the einstein summation convention if not stated otherwise furthermore we use the sign convention as classified by 29 moreover we require sections to be smooth i e u u for any u m open where m is a manifold additionally we write the electric charge e in an upright font in order to avoid confusion with euler s number e vielbeins em and inverse vielbeins e m 1 actually slavnov taylor identities were first discovered by gerard t hooft in 22 2 2 1 differential geometry definition 2 1 spacetime let m g be a lorentzian manifold m g is called a spacetime if it is smooth connected 4 dimensional and time orientable furthermore we choose the west coast mostly minus signature signature for g moreover we denote the constant minkowski metric by and the unit matrix by i e 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 and 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 2 remark 2 2 we assume spacetimes to be 4 dimensional as e g the gravity matter feynman rules depend directly on the spacetime dimension cf remark 2 26 and 30 however the corresponding calculations could also be carried out in dimensions different than 4 definition 2 3 matter compatible spacetime let m g be a spacetime we call m g a matter compatible spacetime if it is diffeomorphic to the minkowski spacetime m remark 2 4 the motivation for definition 2 3 comes from the definition of the graviton field h relative to the minkowski metric cf definition 2 21 2 in a more general setting defini tion 2 3 could be weakened to let m g be a spacetime we call m g a matter compatible spacetime if it is globally hyperbolic oriented time oriented and such that its second de rham cohomology vanishes then this is then motivated by the following facts we want to consider spacetimes with well defined cauchy problems which requires m g to be globally hyperbolic furthermore we want m g to admit a spin structure in order to define matter via a spinor bundle which is equivalent to m g being globally hyperbolic 4 dimensional oriented and time oriented 31 32 finally we want to consider spacetimes which allow the exclusion of magnetic monopoles which is ensured if the second de rham cohomology vanishes as this allows for a global definition of the a priori local connection form iea on the base manifold m definition 2 5 spacetime matter bundle let m g be a matter compatible spacetime then we define the spacetime matter bundle to be the globally trivial super bundle s m tm e u 1 m tm t m u 1 u 1 3 tm is the tangent bundle and e a real 4 dimensional vector bundle used for the definition of vielbeins and inverse vielbeins then considered as the tensor product bundle tm r e to stress that vielbeins and inverse vielbeins are multilinear maps cf definition 2 8 u 1 is the principle bundle modeling electrodynamics and acting via the representation on the spinor bundle m which is a 4 dimensional complex vector bundle modeling fermions cf definition 2 21 u 1 m denotes the corresponding fiber product bundle to which we refer to as twisted spinor bundle finally tm t m and u 1 u 1 denote the parity shifted lie algebra and dual lie algebra bundles of the gauge groups which model the graviton ghost and the photon ghost respectively cf remark 2 23 we equip the spacetime matter bundle with metrics in definition 2 7 which in turn naturally include the corresponding dual 2 it is in principle also possible to choose a different background metric which might require a different topology of m this is for example necessary when a non vanishing cosmological constant is included as the background metric should be a solution of the vacuum einstein field equations then the cosmological constant behaves in the quantum theory like a mass term for the graviton propagator 3 bundles 3 additionally we also equip it with connections in definition 2 10 such that we have a notion of curvature cf definition 2 17 remark 2 6 the global triviality of the spacetime matter bundle in definition 2 5 is motivated by the following facts the tangent bundle tm and the spinor bundle m are globally trivial since matter compatible spacetimes are defined to be diffeomorphic to the minkowski spacetime and are thus in particular parallelizable cf definition 2 3 furthermore the vector bundle e is chosen to be trivial for the definition of vielbeins and inverse vielbeins cf definition 2 8 moreover the u 1 principle bundle is globally trivial since matter compatible spacetimes are defined to be diffeomorphic to the minkowski spacetime and thus in particular have vanishing second de rham cohomology which implies the first chern class of the associated line bundle to vanish cf definition 2 3 finally the parity shifted lie algebra and dual lie algebra bundles of the gauge groups tm t m and u 1 u 1 are globally trivial because of the global triviality of the bundles tm and u 1 definition 2 7 metrics on the spacetime matter bundle we consider the following metrics on the spacetime matter bundle s on the tangent bundle tm we consider the lorentzian metric g with west coast mostly minus signature mapping vector fields x 1 x 2 m tm to the real number x 1 x 2 tm g x 1 x 2 r 4 furthermore on the real vector bundle e we consider the constant minkowski metric with west coast mostly minus signature mapping vector fields y 1 y 2 m e to the real number y 1 y 2 e mny m 1 y n 2 r 5 moreover on the u 1 principle bundle we use the hermitian metric mapping sections s 1 s 2 m u 1 to the complex number 4 s 1 s 2 u 1 s 1 s 2 c 6 additionally on the spinor bundle m we use the hermitian metric together with the clifford multiplication by the unit timelike vector field mapping spinor fields 1 2 m m to the complex number 1 2 m 1 2 c 7 where we have set em 0 m 5 with the curved unit timelike vector field components of a vielbein em 0 6 being introduced in definition 2 8 and the clifford multiplication m being introduced in definition 2 12 thus on the twisted spinor bundle u 1 m we consider the induced fiber product metric mapping twisted spinor fields 1 2 m u 1 m to the complex number 1 2 u 1 m 1 2 c 8 where again we have set em 0 m finally on the parity shifted lie algebra and dual lie algebra bundles of the gauge groups tm t m and u 1 u 1 we consider the metrics induced by the metrics on tm and u 1 3 we denote the dual bundles via the asterisk except for the spinor bundle twisted spinor bundle and the parity shifted lie algebra and dual lie algebra bundles of the gauge groups for which we use the overline 4 where we denote complex conjugation via the asterisk 5 where we denote hermitian conjugation via the dagger 6 we remark that since we consider matter compatible spacetimes to be diffeomorphic to the minkowski space time and thus in particular diffeomorphic to a globally hyperbolic spacetime it is also possible to consider charts in which em 0 m 0 such that in particular em 0 m 0 and some references use this implicitly e g 33 however it should be noted that then the theory is only invariant under diffeomorphisms which preserve global hyperbolicity 4 definition 2 8 vielbeins and inverse vielbeins let s be the spacetime matter bundle then we can define global vector bundle isomorphisms e m t m r e called vielbeins such that g mne m e n 9 a furthermore we can define global inverse vector bundle isomorphisms e m tm r e called inverse vielbeins such that 7 mn g e me n 9 b greek indices here and belong to the tangent bundle tm and are referred to as curved indices thus they are raised and lowered using the usual metric g and its inverse g latin indices here m and n belong to the vector bundle e and are referred to as flat indices thus they are raised and lowered using the minkowski metric mn and its inverse mn therefore inverse vielbeins are related to vielbeins via e m g mne n 10 moreover notice that equations 9 a and 9 b are equivalent to g e n mne m e n 11 which states that when suppressing the einstein summation convention on the flat indices and viewing them as numbers inverse vielbeins e m m 1 2 3 4 are the set of the 4 eigenvector fields of the metric g with eigenvalues mm 1 which are normalized to unit length em g g e me m mm 1 12 finally we remark that the global definition of vielbeins and inverse vielbeins is only possible for parallelizable manifolds such as the matter compatible spacetimes of definition 2 3 this is because the tangent frame bundle fm allows for a global section if and only if the manifold is parallelizable i e it is then possible to choose a global coordinate system on tm that consists of normalized eigenvector fields of the metric g remark 2 9 given the situation of definition 2 8 notice that the definitions of vielbeins and inverse vielbeins are not unique since for any local lorentz transformation acting on e i e a section of the corresponding orthogonal frame bundle u foe acting via the standard representation on e we have g e me n mn rs r m s n g e r e s r m s n g e me n 13 here we denoted the transformed inverse vielbeins via e m e r r m obviously the same calculation also holds for vielbeins instead of inverse vielbeins with local lorentz transformations acting on e this ambiguity will lead to the first term in the spin connection en e l cf equation 17 in fact the first term in the spin connection can be viewed as the gauge field associated to local lorentz transformations 7 we omit the asterisk for inverse vielbeins e when the abstract index notation is used because of equa tion 10 5 definition 2 10 connections on the spacetime matter bundle we use the following connec tions on the spacetime matter bundle s for the tangent bundle tm of the manifold m we use the levi civita connection tm acting on a vector field x m tm via tm x x x 14 a and on a corresponding covector field via tm x x x 14 b with the christoffel symbol given in the case of the levi civita connection via 1 2 g g g g 15 furthermore for the vector bundle e we use the covariant derivative e induced via the connection on the tangent bundle using vielbeins and inverse vielbeins and acting on a vector field y m e via e y n y n n ly l 16 a and on a corresponding covector field via e yn yn l nyl 16 b with the spin connection n l e n tm e l en e l en e l 17 we remark that the first term in the spin connection en e l is due to the ambiguity in the definition of vielbeins and inverse vielbeins as was discussed in remark 2 9 moreover for the u 1 principle bundle we use the covariant derivative u 1 acting on a section s m u 1 via 8 u 1 s s iea s 18 a and on a corresponding dual section via u 1 s s iea s 18 b with the u 1 ir valued connection form iea 9 additionally for the spinor bundle we use the covariant derivative m induced via the connection on the real vector bundle e using a suitable representation and acting on a spinor field m m via m 19 a and on a corresponding cospinor field via m 19 b 8 the existence of global sections in the u 1 principle bundle is ensured by its global triviality cf definition 2 5 contrary to vector bundles such as tm e or m which always allow for the global zero section 9 the imaginary unit i is included into the definition such that a is real valued moreover the coupling constant e is included to introduce the right proportionality constant in the interaction term in the lagrange density lgr ed when taking covariant derivatives of fermion fields cf definition 2 21 6 with the spinor bundle spin connection i 4 rs rs 20 where rs i 2 r s is a representation of spin 1 3 on m thus on the twisted spinor bundle u 1 m we use the covariant derivative u 1 m induced via the connection on the u 1 principle bundle and the connection on the spinor bundle m and acting on a twisted spinor field m u 1 m via 10 u 1 m iea 21 a and on a corresponding twisted cospinor field via u 1 m iea 21 b finally on the parity shifted lie algebra and dual lie algebra bundles of the gauge groups tm t m and u 1 u 1 we use the connections induced via the connections on tm and u 1 respectively we remark that the levi civita connection is metric and torsion free and the other connections are metric remark 2 11 tetrad postulate given the situation of definition 2 8 the tetrad postulate states that vielbeins and inverse vielbeins are parallel sections in u t m r e and u tm r e respectively with respect to the corresponding tensor product bundle connection cf defini tion 2 10 i e we have tm re e n e n e n n le l 0 22 a and tm re e n e n e n l ne l 0 22 b in particular this implies that it is irrelevant whether vielbeins and inverse vielbeins are placed before or after the covariant derivative tm re on the product bundle tm r e finally we remark that despite its name the tetrad postulate is not a postulate but a consequence of the definition of the connection on e via the connection on tm using vielbeins and inverse vielbeins definition 2 12 clifford multiplication given the spacetime matter bundle s we define the clifford multiplication m e r end m for vector fields y m e and spinor fields m m via y y m m 23 furthermore using vielbeins e m t m r e we can define the clifford multiplication e m t m r end m for vector fields x m tm via x x em m 24 moreover we extend this definition to the twisted spinor bundle u 1 m via its action on m and denote it for simplicity via the same symbol m e r end u 1 m then we obtain for vector fields y m e and twisted spinor fields m u 1 m y y m m 25 10 being pedantic equations 21 should actually read u 1 m id iea id and u 1 m id iea id 7 additionally using vielbeins e m t m r e we can extend this definition to obtain e m t m r end u 1 m for vector fields x m tm x x em m 26 in the following we typically use the latter definitions for the twisted spinor bundle remark 2 13 we remark that the clifford multiplication or e turns the spaces of spinor fields m m and twisted spinor fields m u 1 m into modules over the space of vector fields m e or m tm respectively 11 furthermore it induces an automorphism if and only if the corresponding vector field y m e or x m tm has nowhere vanishing seminorm with respect to the metric mn or g respectively i e y mny my n 6 0 or x g g x x 6 0 12 definition 2 14 clifford relation we set the clifford relation for the vector bundle e as m n 2 mn id 27 or equivalently using vielbeins e m t m r e for the tangent bundle tm as em e n m n 2 g id 28 where the identity automorphism id is either considered on the spinor bundle m or extended to the twisted spinor bundle u 1 m cf definition 2 12 remark 2 15 we remark that the west coast mostly minus signature for the metrics g and together with the plus signed clifford relation induces a quaternionic representation for the clifford algebra cliff 1 3 as the matrix algebra mat 2 h choosing the pauli matrices as a representation for the quaternions we obtain the usual complex dirac representation as the matrix algebra mat 4 c whose generators are hermitian definition 2 16 twisted dirac operator let s be the spacetime matter bundle from def inition 2 5 then we define the dirac operator m on spinors m m such that the following diagram commutes m m m m m t m r m m tm r m m m g 1 rid e 29 a here m is the covariant derivative on the spinor bundle m and en n is the local representation of the clifford multiplication with n being the usual minkowski spacetime 11 this is similar to the fact that all spaces of super vector fields are modules over spaces of functions i e m tm m e m tm t m and m u 1 u 1 are modules over the space m r and m m and m u 1 m are modules over the space m c 12 again this is similar to the fact that the multiplication of a super vector field with a function induces an automorphism if and only if the corresponding function f m k for k r c has nowhere vanishing absolute value i e f 6 0 the only difference is that the clifford multiplication depends also on the metric which only induces a norm if the metric is positive or negative definite 8 dirac matrices thus the local description of the dirac operator on the spinor bundle m is given via 13 m e m m m e m m 29 b furthermore we extend this definition to the twisted spinor bundle u 1 m using the covariant derivative u 1 m instead of m then we define the twisted dirac operator u 1 m on twisted spinors m u 1 m such that the following diagram com mutes m u 1 m m u 1 m m t m r u 1 m m tm r u 1 m u 1 m u 1 m g 1 rid e 30 a here u 1 m iea is the covariant derivative on the twisted spinor bundle u 1 m and the rest as above thus the local description of the twisted dirac operator on the twisted spinor bundle u 1 m is given via 14 u 1 m e m m u 1 m e m m iea 30 b definition 2 17 curvatures of the spacetime matter bundle using the connections from definition 2 10 on the spacetime matter bundle s we can construct curvature tensors as com mutators of the corresponding covariant derivatives we start with the riemann tensor of the tangent bundle which acts on a vector field x m tm via r x tm tm x 31 a and reads r 31 b starting from the riemann tensor we can define the ricci tensor as the following contraction r r 32 and finally the ricci scalar as r g r 33 13 notice that by the tetrad postulate given in remark 2 11 it does not matter whether we place the inverse vielbeins e m before or after the covariant derivative m if we place it after however we need to consider the covariant derivative tm re m 14 notice again that by the tetrad postulate given in remark 2 11 it does not matter whether we place the inverse vielbeins e m before or after the covariant derivative u 1 m if we place it after however we need to consider the covariant derivative tm re u 1 m 9 furthermore we can construct the curvature two form on the u 1 principle bundle which acts on a section s m tm via 15 f s u 1 u 1 s 34 a and reads f ie a a 34 b finally we remark that being forms the connection form iea and the curvature form f both have naturally lower indices proposition 2 18 ricci scalar for the levi civita connection using the levi civita connec tion the ricci scalar is given via partial derivatives of the metric and its inverse as follows r g g g g g g g g g 1 4 g g 3 4 g 1 2 g g g 35 proof the claim is verified by the calculation r g r g g g g 1 2 g 1 2 g g g g g g g g g 1 2 g 1 4 g g 1 4 g 1 2 g g g g g g g g g g 1 4 g g 3 4 g 1 2 g g g 36 where we have used g g g g which results from 0 tm g g g g g g 37 15 we stress that f is defined as the covariant exterior derivative of the connection form iea or for abelian gauge groups via the ordinary exterior derivative as given in equation 34 b thus it has nothing to do with the connection on the tangent bundle nevertheless for torsion free connections the expressions coincide as the christoffel symbols are then symmetric in their lower two indices i e 10 remark 2 19 assuming the levi civita connection the riemann tensor r and the ricci tensor r are not sensitive to the choice of the signature of the metric g whereas the lowered riemann tensor r g r and the ricci scalar r are therefore the einstein hilbert lagrange density is sensitive to this choice as well which is the reason for the minus sign in front of the einstein hilbert lagrange density in equation 72 b in our west coast mostly minus signature convention cf definition 2 1 definition 2 20 riemannian volume form we define the riemannian volume form for the spacetime m g as dvg det g dt dx dy dz 38 in particular the riemannian volume form for the minkowski spacetime m is given via dv dt dx dy dz 39 definition 2 21 fermion photon and graviton field the mathematical objects correspond in the following way to physical particles the deviation of the metric g from the minkowski metric is defined to be proportional to the graviton field h with the proportionality factor given by the gravitational coupling constant 8 g to obtain the right interaction couplings 16 i e h 1 g g h 40 the graviton field can be thought of as a symmetric 0 2 tensor field living on the flat back ground minkowski spacetime m i e h m sym 2 t m moreover the connection form iea is defined to be proportional to the photon field a with the proportionality fac tor given by the imaginary unit i and the electromagnetic coupling constant e such that the photon field is real and induces the right interaction couplings with fermions it induces the faraday or electromagnetic field strength tensor f cf definition 2 17 moreover a section in the spinor bundle m m corresponds to a fermion field in particular in our case it is a linear combination of the electron and the positron field with charge e respectively in the following we are interested in the coupling of the fermion field to the photon field a mathematically this is obtained by viewing fermions as sections in the twisted spinor bundle m u 1 m therefore in the following we use twisted spinor fields i e sections in the twisted bundle u 1 m if not stated otherwise which are denoted by compared to which denote sections in m spinors and twisted spinors induce the four current j defined via j e m m e m m 41 finally the ghosts are sections in the parity shifted lie algebra and dual lie algebra bun dles of the gauge groups tm t m and u 1 u 1 we have the graviton ghost m tm the graviton antighost m t m the photon ghost m u 1 and the photon antighost m u 1 remark 2 22 physical interpretation of the connections on the spacetime matter bundle we stress that even though the connections on the spacetime matter bundle are mathematically similarly defined cf definition 2 10 their physical interpretation is rather different cf defini tion 2 21 the christoffel symbols and the spin connection n l are proportional to a series in the graviton field i e to a sum of arbitrary many particles contrary the connection form iea on the u 1 principle bundle corresponds directly to the photon field i e to a single particle 16 where g is newton s constant and we have furthermore where 8 g is einstein s constant 11 remark 2 23 gauge transformations the lagrange density of gr ed equation 72 b is invariant under two different symmetry transformations in the following called gauge trans formations 17 the first are diffeomorphisms of spacetime m g homotopic to the identity diff 0 m and the second are u 1 principle bundle automorphisms aut m u 1 while the first affects the whole spacetime matter bundle s the second affects only the u 1 principle bundle together with the spinor bundle m due to the action we remark that in contrast to finite dimensional lie groups the exponential map exp g g 42 is not locally surjective for infinite dimensional lie groups such as diff 0 m rather they are regular lie groups in the sense that there exists a bijective evolution operator from smooth curves in the lie algebra to smooth curves in the lie group evol i g i g 43 where i r is a compact interval cf 34 35 36 37 concretely we have diff m c m tm 44 a where c m tm denotes compactly supported vector fields and thus i diff m c i m tm 44 b i e compactly supported one parameter vector fields x for i 18 and u 1 ir 45 thus we can associate elements in the corresponding lie algebras with elements in the corre sponding lie groups this will be useful when we consider infinitesimal gauge transformations in order to fix the gauge and calculate the faddeev popov ghosts in subsubsections 2 2 2 and 2 2 3 respectively using the notations x evol x i diff m i diff 0 m 46 with i and x c i m tm and f exp f u 1 u 1 47 with f m u 1 the transformations of sections in the spacetime matter bundle m s with respect to x and f are given via corresponding pullbacks and pushforewards 19 fur thermore we also remark the identities d d x 0 x 0 48 17 we remark that the invariance is only strict for the bundle automorphism aut m u 1 because diffeomorphisms homotopic to the identity diff 0 m add a total derivative to the einstein hilbert lagrange density 18 we remark that diffeomorphisms homotopic to the identity diff 0 m differ from the identity also only on compactly supported domains 19 in the following we will not make a distinction between pullbacks and pushforewards as for diffeomorphisms homotopic to the identity diff 0 m the pushforeward is the pullback of the inverse i e 1 and vice versa this applies in particular also to bundle automorphisms f aut m u 1 furthermore when regarding evolutions we need to take the sign of the parameter into account as x 1 x i e contravariant indices transform via x x whereas covariant indices transform via x x 12 and d d f 0 f 49 moreover given an arbitrary tensor field of type r s t m t rsm such that the tensor field x t is representable via a taylor series around 0 we can consider the taylor expansion of its pullback x t in the parameter around 0 which converges then for some j i open x t k 0 1 k dk d k x t 0 k k 0 1 k kx t k 50 a where we have set kx t p dk d k x tp 0 50 b for all p m we remark that 0 x t t is the identity and 1 x t x 0 t is the lie derivative with respect to the constant vector field x 0 lemma 2 24 given the situation of remark 2 23 and a constant vector field x x 20 then the coefficients of equations 50 a and 50 b are given via iterated lie derivatives i e k 1 x t p x kxt p 51 20 in general the formulas will also contain derivatives of the vector field x in the parameter 13 proof this follows from the following calculation k 1 x t p dk 1 d k 1 x tp 0 d d 1 dk d k 2 1 2 x tp 1 0 2 0 d d 1 dk d k 2 1 x 2 x tp 1 0 2 0 d d 1 dk d k 2 1 x 2 x tp p 1 0 2 0 d d 1 dk d k 2 1 x 2 x tp p 2 0 1 0 d d 1 1 x dk d k 2 2 x tp 2 0 p 1 0 d d 1 1 x kxt p 1 0 x kxt p 52 remark 2 25 infinitesimal transformation properties given the situation of remark 2 23 we are now interested in infinitesimal transformation properties of the graviton field and the photon field this is needed in order to fix the gauge and calculate the faddeev popov ghosts in sub subsections 2 2 2 and 2 2 3 respectively to this end we can restrict to diffeomorphisms that are given as the flow of a constant vector field x x i e x diff 0 m as they generate the corresponding lie algebra diff m cf equation 48 to obtain the right interaction behaviour for the corresponding ghosts with the other fields we rescale the vector field x m tm by and the lie algebra section f m u 1 by ie 21 i e set x 1 x x x 53 and f i e f f ief 54 then the infinitesimal transformations of the graviton field h and the photon field a with respect to x are given via lie derivatives with respect to x and read o denotes the landau symbol x h h x x 2 x o 2 55 21 given that u 1 ir the convention is such that the connection form iea m t m r u 1 is purely imaginary and thus a m t m r r m t m is real and in particular hermitian as is the case when this definition is used for non abelian gauge theories thus in particular f m u 1 m ir with f m r 14 and x a a g a x g a x g a x o 2 56 furthermore the photon field a transforms in the following way under the principle bundle automorphism f aut m u 1 f a a f 57 where f m r is the real valued function on the spacetime m g associated to the bundle automorphism f finally we remark that only the linearized riemann tensor is invariant under the gauge transformation of equation 55 this is similar to non abelian gauge theories where the field strength tensor is also not invariant under gauge transformations however being a lorentz scalar the ricci scalar is invariant remark 2 26 feynman rules 1 to calculate the corresponding gravity matter feynman rules we need to express the inverse metric vielbeins and inverse vielbeins and the prefactor of the riemannian volume form in terms of the graviton field since we need only general properties of the feynman rules in this work we just motivate their derivation here and refer for a detailed treatment to 30 cf also 33 38 22 furthermore we remark that all following series converge if and only if h max max ew h 1 where ew h denotes the set of eigenvalues of h the inverse metric in terms of the graviton field is given by the corresponding neumann series i e g k 0 k hk 58 where h h 59 a h 0 59 b and hk h 1 h 1 2 h k 1 k times k n 59 c furthermore the expressions for vielbeins and inverse vielbeins read em k 0 k 1 2 k hk m 60 a with hm m h and e m k 0 k 1 2 k hk m 60 b with h m mh moreover the prefactor of the riemannian volume form det g det h det det 1 h det h 61 22 where we refer again to footnote 6 for a comment on the spinor feynman rules in 33 15 can be obtained by first expressing the determinant in terms of traces and then plug the result into the taylor series expansion of the square root more precisely the determinant of a 4 4 matrix 23 m can be expressed via newton s identities in terms of its trace as det m 1 4 det tr m 1 0 0 tr m 2 tr m 2 0 tr m 3 tr m 2 tr m 3 tr m 4 tr m 3 tr m 2 tr m 62 now we set m h 63 since the trace is linear we have tr h tr tr h 4 h 64 and similar expressions for the higher powers tr h k for k 2 3 4 thus the determinant is a polynomial in traces of powers of h i e det h r tr h 2 tr h 2 3 tr h 3 4 tr h 4 65 we separate the constant term which is 1 and summarize the non constant terms as the poly nomial p h i e p h det h 1 det h p h 1 66 then we plug this expression into the taylor series expansion of the square root around 1 i e x 1 k 0 1 2 k xk 67 which converges for x 1 finally we to obtain det g det h p h 1 k 0 1 2 k p h k 68 however for the realm of this article it suffices to know that the inverse metric vielbeins inverse vielbeins and the prefactor of the riemannian volume form are all power series in the graviton field h remark 2 27 feynman rules 2 in this article we consider two loop propagator feynman graphs and one loop propagator and three point feynman graphs therefore it is actually sufficient to consider the lagrange density lqgr qed only up to order 2 since the higher valent graviton vertices would only contribute to graphs with self loops thus the formulas from remark 2 26 read as follows o denotes the landau symbol the inverse metric is given by g h 2 h h o 3 69 23 this works for any d d matrix with the obvious generalizations of the following formulas 16 furthermore vielbeins and inverse vielbeins defined in definition 2 8 are given by em m 1 2 mh 1 8 2 mh h o 3 70 a and e m m 1 2 h m 3 8 2 h h m o 3 70 b and finally the prefactor of the riemannian volume form defined in definition 2 20 is given by det g 1 1 2 h 1 8 2 h h 2 h h o 3 71 2 2 the lagrange density of qgr qed having introduced the necessary differential geometric background in subsection 2 1 we can now turn our attention to physics in this article we consider qgr qed described via the following lagrange density as a functional on the spacetime matter bundle s lqgr qed lgr ed lgf lghost 72 a where lgr ed is the classical lagrange density of general relativity gr coupled with spinor electrodynamics ed lgr ed 1 2 2 r 1 4 e 2 g g f f i u 1 m m dvg 72 b lgf is the gauge fixing lagrange density lgf 1 4 2 g dd dd 1 2 e 2 l 2 dvg 72 c with dd g and l g tm iea and lghost is the ghost lagrange density lghost 1 2 g g 1 2 g g a g a g a g g g a g a g a g c g dvg 72 d with the graviton ghost and graviton antighost and respectively and the photon ghost and photon antighost and respectively and g c denotes ghost conjugate as explained below we compute the ghost lagrange density equation 72 d via the faddeev popov method 39 and remark that this can be embedded into the more general frameworks of brst cohomology 40 41 42 43 44 45 and bv formalism 46 47 48 we refer the interested reader to 49 50 51 for general introductions to brst cohomology and bv formalism and to 52 for the particular discussion of perturbative quantum general relativity we remark that in these formulations the lagrange multiplier is viewed as a vector in the corresponding lie algebra this is equivalent 17 to our formulation where the lagrange multiplier is a scalar if a non degenerate metric is present on the lie algebra more precisely in this case the product of the lagrange multiplier viewed as a vector in the lie algebra with the gauge fixing map described via a momentum map depends only on its length since only the vector components parallel to the gauge fixing map contribute thus the vector valued lagrange multiplier can be replaced via a scalar multiple of the gauge fixing function as in our gauge fixing lagrange density equation 72 c now we discuss the parts of the qgr qed lagrange density lqgr qed in detail 2 2 1 the lagrange density of gr ed the classical lagrange density of general relativity coupled with spinor electrodynamics is the sum of the einstein hilbert maxwell and dirac lagrange densities lgr ed 1 2 2 r 1 4 e 2 g g f f i u 1 m m dvg 73 where we have rescaled the einstein hilbert term by 1 2 and the maxwell term by 1 e 2 such that the graviton and photon propagators are of order o 0 and o e 0 respectively here r g r is the ricci scalar of the tangent bundle cf definition 2 17 f is the curvature two form on the u 1 principle bundle cf definition 2 17 u 1 m the twisted dirac operator cf definition 2 16 and dvg is the riemannian volume form cf definition 2 20 the classical lagrange density lgr ed leads to the einstein field equations g 2 t 74 a where g r 1 2 rg 74 b is the einstein tensor and t 1 e 2 g f f 1 4 g g g f f i 4 em m u 1 m u 1 m m i 4 en n u 1 m u 1 m n 74 c is the corresponding generalized hilbert energy momentum tensor for spinor electrodynam ics 24 we remark that considering linearized gr is equivalent to the vanishing of the first bracket in equation 35 from proposition 2 18 i e considering locally geometries such that g g g g 0 75 which could otherwise be interpreted as a source term for the graviton field h thus when considering feynman rules it would correspond to a graviton half edge however the cor responding feynman rule vanishes if momentum conservation is considered nevertheless it produces additional contributions to the higher valent pure graviton vertex feynman rules ob serve that the coupling of the graviton field to the matter fields is given via inverse metrics inverse vielbeins the spin connection in the dirac operator and the prefactor of the riemannian volume form 24 where we have already used the equations of motion for the fermionic energy momentum contribution 18 2 2 2 gauge fixing lagrange density in qgr qed there are two gauge symmetries present one coming from general relativity and affecting the whole spacetime matter bundle s and the other one coming from electrodynamics and affecting the u 1 principle bundle only these gauge transformations are described in remark 2 23 and lead to the transformations of the graviton and photon fields as given in remark 2 25 thus the gauge fixing part of the lagrange density consists also of two parts one for transformations due to infinitesimal diffeomorphisms where we choose the de donder gauge g 0 g g 1 2 g g 76 and one for infinitesimal principle bundle automorphisms where we choose the lorenz gauge g tm iea 0 77 the de donder gauge is motivated by the fact that in this gauge the divergence of a vector or covector field reduces to the following simpler expression involving only a partial derivative tm x x x g x x g x x 78 thus the beltrami laplace operator takes on the simple form tmbeltrami g 79 and in particular coordinate functions x m are harmonic tmbeltramix g x g 0 80 therefore this gauge is also called harmonic coordinate condition furthermore we remark that in general there does not exist a gauge such that the evolution of the graviton field is governed by a wave equation because the graviton field is in general non linear this comes from the first term in equation 35 cf the comment before equation 75 if however the linearized einstein hilbert lagrange density is considered together with the de donder gauge then the evolution of the graviton field is given via a wave equation a fact which is used in gravitational wave analysis cf e g 53 on the other hand the lorenz gauge is motivated by the fact that then the photon field a satisfies a wave equation with a source term given by the dual four current g j and the ricci curvature tensor applied to it r a 25 tmbochnera g tm tm a g tm tm a tm a tm a g tm i e f tm a g j g tm tm tm tm a g j g r a g j r a 81 25 where we have used that the levi civita connection is torsion free i e to match the definition of f cf definition 2 17 and footnote 15 19 where tmbochner is the bochner laplace operator observe that when we apply the de donder gauge given in equation 76 to the lorenz gauge given in equation 77 the expression simplifies to g tm iea g iea iea g iea 82 as was shown in general in equation 78 for the following we write the de donder gauge as dd g 0 83 and the lorenz gauge as l g tm iea 0 84 we implement the de donder gauge and the lorenz gauge in the lagrange density by using the lagrange multipliers 1 and 1 which act in the quantum theory like coupling constants i e by adding the following lagrange density lgf 1 4 2 g dd dd 1 2 e 2 l 2 dvg 85 where dvg is the riemannian volume form cf definition 2 20 if 1 and 1 are interpreted as parameters rather than lagrange multipliers then 1 corresponds to the de donder gauge and 1 to the feynman gauge 2 2 3 ghost lagrange density in qgr qed two ghosts together with their antighosts are needed the graviton ghost and graviton antighost which we denote by and respectively and the photon ghost and photon antighost which we denote by by and respectively the ghost lagrange density is obtained via faddeev popov s method as the variation of the gauge fixing condition via a gauge transformation and then replacing the transformation fields via the corresponding ghosts multiplied with the antighost corresponding to the gauge fixing then the variation of the lagrange density with respect to the antighosts gives the equation of motion for the ghosts which corresponds to the residual gauge transformations of the chosen gauge fixings furthermore we have added the ghost conjugate for the interaction terms involving the graviton ghost and the photon antighost i e the corresponding interaction terms with the graviton antighost and the photon ghost with the rest unaltered second term below observe also that the photon ghost couples to gravitons and thus is needed in contrast to normal qed where it decouples from the other particles lghost 1 2 g d d x 7 i 2 e l x 7 g c i e l f 7 dvg 1 2 g g 1 2 g g a g a g a g g g a g a g a g c g dvg 86 20 where we have set 26 d d g x x x x 87 l g g x a g a x a x g g x a g a x a x g 88 and l g f f 89 i e the gauge conditions dd and l from equations 76 and 77 applied to linearized pure gauge transformations from equations 55 56 and 57 and dvg is the riemannian volume form cf definition 2 20 moreover g c means ghost conjugate i e the simultaneous replacement 90 with the rest unaltered but partially integrated such that there is no partial derivative in front of we also remark the additional factor of 1 2 in front of the ghost mixing terms due to the addition of the corresponding ghost conjugate terms finally we notice that the photon ghost is a scalar particle whereas the graviton ghost is a spin one particle 3 hopf algebras the renormalization hopf algebra and qgr qed in this section we introduce hopf algebras in general and the connes kreimer renormalization hopf algebra in particular the intention is to review the basic notions and give the relevant definitions we refer the reader who wishes a more detailed treatment on hopf algebras in general and its connection to affine group schemes to 54 55 and the reader who wishes a more detailed treatment on the construction of the connes kreimer renormalization hopf algebra to 13 14 15 16 17 56 in this work we set k to be a commutative ring with one and then later consider the case k q for the connes kreimer renormalization hopf algebra 27 furthermore we set the tensor product over the corresponding ring if not stated otherwise i e k finally we study hopf ideals in the renormalization hopf algebra in order to understand which symmetries are compatible with renormalization 3 1 hopf algebras we start by defining hopf algebras in general in this article we set k to be a commutative ring with one furthermore by algebra we mean associative algebra with identity and by coalgebra we mean coassociative coalgebra with coidentity moreover all algebras coalgebras bialgebras and hopf algebras are all considered over the ring k 26 be aware of the difference between widetilde and tilde for the transformed lorentz gauge i e l vs l 27 actually the physical needs require k only to be a field with characteristic 0 since q is the smallest such field it is the canonical choice 21 definition 3 1 algebra the triple a m i is an algebra where a is a k module m a a a an associative multiplication map i e the following diagram commutes a a a a a a a a m id id m m m 91 and i k a the identity with respect to m 28 i e the following diagram commutes k a a a a k a i id m id i 92 definition 3 2 connected graded algebra an algebra a is called graded if the k module a can be written as a direct sum a i 0 ai 93 which is respected by the multiplication m i e m ai aj ai j i j n 0 94 and the identity i i e i a 0 a a 0 7 a 0 95 furthermore a graded algebra a is called connected if the grade zero component is isomorphic to the base ring i e a 0 k 96 definition 3 3 coalgebra the triple c i is a coalgebra where c is a k module c c c a coassociative comultiplication map i e the following diagram commutes c c c c c c c c id id 97 and i c k the coidentity with respect to 29 i e the following diagram commutes c k c c c c k i id id i 98 28 we denote both the neutral element in the algebra a with respect to the multiplication map m and the inclusion function k a by the symbol i 29 we denote both the neutral element in the coalgebra c with respect to the comultiplication map and the projection function c k by the symbol i 22 definition 3 4 connected graded coalgebra a coalgebra c is called graded if the k module c can be written as a direct sum c i 0 ci 99 which is respected by the comultiplication i e ci i j 0 cj ci j i n 0 100 and the coidentity i i e i c c 0 ci 7 0 ici 101 where 0 i is the kronecker delta and ci ci are homogeneous elements of degree i furthermore a graded coalgebra c is called connected if the grade zero component is isomorphic to the base ring i e c 0 k 102 definition 3 5 homomorphism of graded algebras let a 1 and a 2 be two algebras then a map f a 1 a 2 is called a homomorphism of algebras if f is compatible with the products m 1 on a 1 and m 2 on a 2 i e the following diagram commutes a 1 a 1 a 1 a 2 a 2 a 2 m 1 f f f m 2 103 and f maps the identity i 1 on a 1 to the identity i 2 on a 2 i e the following diagram commutes k a 1 a 2 i 1 i 2 f 104 if the algebras a 1 and a 2 are both graded then f additionally has to respect this structure to be a homomorphism of graded algebras i e f a 1 i a 2 i i n 0 105 definition 3 6 homomorphism of graded coalgebras let c 1 and c 2 be two coalgebras then a map g c 1 c 2 is called a homomorphism of coalgebras if g is compatible with the two coproducts 1 on c 1 and 2 on c 2 i e the following diagram commutes c 1 c 1 c 1 c 2 c 2 c 2 1 g g g 2 106 23 and g is compatible with the two coidentities i 1 on c 1 and i 2 on c 2 i e the following diagram commutes c 1 c 2 k g i 1 i 2 107 if the coalgebras c 1 and c 2 are both graded then g additionally has to respect this structure to be a homomorphism of graded coalgebras i e g c 1 i c 2 i i n 0 108 remark 3 7 relation between algebra and coalgebra finite dimensional connected graded algebras a are related to connected graded coalgebras c via dualization i e applying the functor homk alg k definition 3 8 connected graded bialgebra the quintuple b m i i is a bialgebra where the triple b m i is an algebra and the triple b i is a coalgebra furthermore the coproduct and the coidentity i are homomorphisms of the graded algebra b m i or equivalently the multiplication m and the identity i are homomorphisms of the graded coalgebra b i furthermore a bialgebra b is called graded if it is graded as an algebra and as a coalgebra moreover a bialgebra b is called connected if it is connected as an algebra or equivalently as a coalgebra 30 definition 3 9 connected graded hopf algebra the sextuple h m i i s is a hopf al gebra where the quintuple h m i i is a bialgebra and s h h is an anti endomorphism 31 called the antipode and is defined such that the following diagram commutes h h h h h k h h h h h s id m i i id s m 109 furthermore a hopf algebra h is called graded if it is graded as a bialgebra 32 moreover a hopf algebra h is called connected if it is connected as a bialgebra definition 3 10 hopf ideals and hopf subalgebras let h be a hopf algebra and i an ideal in h then i is called a hopf ideal if it satisfies additionally the following three conditions i i h h i 110 a i i 0 110 b 30 it can be shown that a connected graded bialgebra possesses an antipode and thus is already a hopf algebra cf definition 3 9 31 meaning that in the case of non commutative hopf algebras the antipode is an order reversing endomorphism i e given x y h then we have s xy s y s x 32 observe that if a hopf algebra h is graded as a bialgebra then the antipode s is automatically an anti endomorphism of graded algebras and an anti endomorphism of graded coalgebras 24 and s i i 110 c then the quotient h h i is a hopf algebra as well called a hopf subalgebra of h if h is graded then h inherits a grading from h via h h h i 0 hi h i 0 hi h i 0 hi 111 i e we define the grade i subspace of h as hi hi h for all i n 0 furthermore if h is connected then h is also connected since i 6 0 in h and thus h 0 ki k definition 3 11 augmentation ideal quoted from 1 given a bi or a hopf algebra b then the kernel of the coidentity aug hq ker i 112 is an ideal called the augmentation ideal furthermore we denote the projector to it via p i e p hq aug hq 113 definition 3 12 convolution product let a be an algebra and c a coalgebra then using the multiplication ma on a and the comultiplication c on c we can turn the k module homk mod c a of k linear maps from c to a into a k algebra by defining the convolution product for given f g homk mod c a via f g ma f g c 114 obviously this definition extends trivially if a or c possesses additionally a bi or hopf algebra structure since it only requires a coalgebra structure in the source algebra and an algebra structure in the target algebra 3 2 the connes kreimer renormalization hopf algebra from now on we consider the connes kreimer renormalization hopf algebra which is a hopf algebra over k q 33 furthermore let in this subsection q be a local qft such that the residue for each divergent feynman graph is in the residue set of q the general case will be discussed in subsection 3 3 cf problem 3 32 definition 3 13 weighted residue set of a local qft let q be a local qft then q is either given via a lagrange density lq or via a set of residues rq together with a weight function rq n 0 the set of residues is a disjoint union of all vertex types r 0 q and all edge types r 1 q of q i e rq r 0 q q r 1 q if q is given via a lagrange density then the set of residues rq and the weight r of each residue r rq is given as follows each field in the lagrange density lq corresponds to a particle type of q therefore every monomial in lq consisting of one field corresponds to a source term i e a vertex residue in r 0 q consisting of a half edge of that particle type every monomial in lq consisting of two equivalent fields corresponds to a propagation term i e an edge residue in r 1 q consisting of an edge of that particle type 33 again the physical needs require k only to be a field with characteristic 0 since q is the smallest such field it is the canonical choice 25 and every monomial in lq consisting of different fields corresponds to an interaction term i e a vertex residue in r 0 q consisting of half edges of that particle types finally the weight r n 0 of a residue r rq is set to be the number of derivative operators involved in the corresponding field monomial in lq definition 3 14 feynman graphs generated by residue sets 1 let q be a local qft with residue set rq then we denote by gq the set of all one particle irreducible 1 pi feynman graphs 34 that can be generated by the residue set rq of q definition 3 15 residue of a feynman graph let q be a local qft with residue set rq and feynman graph set gq then the residue of a feynman graph gq denoted by res is the vertex residue or edge residue res not necessary in the residue set rq obtained by shrinking all internal edges of to a single vertex definition 3 16 amplitude set of a local qft let q be a local qft with residue set rq and feynman graph set gq then we introduce its amplitude set aq as the set of residues of all feynman graphs aq r res gq 115 obviously the residue set is a subset thereof rq aq and thus the amplitude set splits into a disjoint union of the residue set rq and the pure quantum correction set cq aq rq q cq 116 definition 3 17 first betti number of a feynman graph 57 let q be a local qft and gq the set of its feynman graphs let furthermore gq be a feynman graph then we define the first betti number of as b 1 h 1 117 where h 1 is the rank of the first singular homology group of definition 3 18 superficial degree of divergence let q be a local qft with weighted residue set rq and feynman graph set gq we turn gq into a weighted set as well by declaring the function gq z 7 db 1 v 0 v e 1 e 118 where d is the dimension of spacetime of q and b 1 the first betti number of the feynman graph gq then the weight of a feynman graph gq is called the superficial degree of divergence of a feynman graph gq is called superficially divergent if 0 otherwise it is called superficially convergent if 0 remark 3 19 the definition of the superficial degree of divergence of a feynman graph defini tion 3 18 is motivated by the fact that the feynman integral corresponding to a given feynman graph via the feynman rules converges if the feynman graph itself and all its subgraphs are superficially convergent 58 definition 3 20 set of superficially divergent subgraphs of a feynman graph 1 let q be a local qft and gq a feynman graph of q then we denote by d the set of superficially 34 the use of 1 pi feynman graphs rather than connected feynman graphs is justified by theorem 3 55 as is discussed in remark 3 56 26 divergent subgraphs of i e d m m 1 m m n m 0 m 119 a furthermore we define the set d of superficially divergent proper subgraphs of i e d d 119 b definition 3 21 renormalization hopf algebra of a local qft let q be a local qft rq the set of its weighted residues and gq the set of its weighted feynman graphs we assume q to be such that the residues of all superficially divergent feynman graphs are in the residue set rq i e gq 0 res rq the general and more involving case is discussed in subsection 3 3 then the connected graded cf definition 3 25 renormalization hopf algebra hq m i i s is defined as follows we set hq to be the vector space over q generated by the set gq the associative multiplication m hq hq hq is defined as the disjoint union of feynman graphs i e m hq hq hq 7 120 then the identity i q hq is set to be the empty graph i e i 121 moreover we define the coproduct of a feynman graph such that it maps to the following sum over all possible combinations of divergent subgraphs of the left hand side of the tensor product of each summand is given by a superficially divergent subgraph of the feynman graph while the right hand side of the tensor product is given by returning the feynman graph with the corresponding subgraph shrunken to zero length i e hq hq hq 7 d 122 where the quotient is defined as follows if is a proper subgraph of then is defined by shrinking all internal edges of in to a single vertex for each connected component of otherwise if we define the quotient to be the identity i e i the coidentity i hq q is set such that its kernel is the hopf algebra without the subalgebra generated by i i e i hq q 7 q if qi with q q 0 else 123 finally we define the antipode recursively via the normalization s i i and on aug hq via s hq hq 7 s p d s 124 where p is the projector onto the augmentation ideal from definition 3 11 and the quotient is defined as in the definition of the coproduct after equation 122 definition 3 22 reduced coproduct let q be a local qft as in definition 3 21 rq the set of its weighted residues and hq m i i s its renormalization hopf algebra then we define the reduced coproduct as the non trivial part of the coproduct i e hq hq hq 7 d 125 27 in particular the coproduct and the reduced coproduct are related via i i 126 definition 3 23 product of coupling constants of a feynman graph let q be a local qft and gq the set of its feynman graphs let furthermore m m 1 m be a product of m n connected feynman graphs m gq 1 m m then we define the product of coupling constants of as cpl m m 1 1 cpl res m v 0 m cpl v 127 with cpl res m coupling constant of the vertex res m if res m r 0 q 1 else 128 definition 3 24 multi index corresponding to the product of coupling constants of a feynman graph let q be a local qft and gq the set of its feynman graphs let furthermore m m 1 m be a product of m n 1 connected feynman graphs m gq 1 m m and cpl the product of its coupling constants then we define the multi index c zn where n n 1 denotes the number of coupling constants of q corresponding to cpl as the vector counting the multiplicities of the several coupling constants in cpl definition 3 25 connectedness and gradings of the renormalization hopf algebra let q be a local qft as in definition 3 21 rq the set of its residues and hq its renormalization hopf algebra in the following sums and direct sums over multi indices are understood component wise e g let g g 1 g n z n and g g 1 g n z n be two multi indices with n n 0 entries then we set g g g g 1 g 1 g 1 g n gn g n and g g g g 1 g 1 g 1 g n gn g n 129 furthermore we set 0 01 0 n 1 n and 1 n then we consider the following three gradings of hq as a hopf algebra which are further refinements of each other the first grading comes from the first betti number i e hq l 0 hq l 130 the second grading comes from the multi index corresponding to the coupling constants of a feynman graph i e hq c hq c 131 finally the third grading comes from the multi index corresponding to the vertex residues of a feynman graph i e hq r hq r 132 clearly hq l 0 hq c 0 hq r 0 q and thus hq is connected in all three gradings in this article we use mainly the second grading 28 definition 3 26 symmetry factor of a feynman graph let q be a local qft and gq the set of its feynman graphs let furthermore gq be a feynman graph then we define the symmetry factor of as sym aut 133 where aut is the rank of the automorphism group of leaving its external leg structure fixed and respecting its vertex and edge types v rq and e rq for all v 0 and e 1 respectively definition 3 27 combinatorial green s functions let q be a local qft rq the set of its residues and gq the set of its feynman graphs given r rq we set for notational simplicity in this definition xr gq res r 1 sym 134 then we define the total combinatorial green s function with residue r as the following sums xr i xr if r r 0 q i xr if r r 1 q xr else i e r rq 135 finally we denote the restriction of xr to one of the gradings g from definition 3 25 via xrg x r g 136 remark 3 28 we remark that restricted combinatorial green s functions are in the literature often denoted via crg and differ by a minus sign from our definition our convention is such that they are given as the restriction of the total combinatorial green s function to the corresponding grading which requires minus signs for non empty propagator graphs definition 3 29 hopf subalgebras for multiplicative renormalization let q be a local qft as in definition 3 21 rq its weighted residue set hq its renormalization hopf algebra and xrg hq its restricted green s functions where g and g denotes one of the gradings from definition 3 25 we are interested in hopf subalgebras which correspond to multiplicative renormalization i e hopf subalgebras of hq such that the coproduct factors on the restricted combinatorial green s functions for all multi indices g in the following way xrg g g 0 pg x r g x r g g 137 where pg xrg hq is a polynomial in graphs such that each summand has multi index g 35 35 there exist closed expressions for the polynomials pg x r g as follows pg x r g x r q g g 138 where the overline denotes the restriction to divergent graphs and qv denotes so called combinatorial charges which were introduced in 59 see also 60 for a treatment using the same notations and conventions 29 remark 3 30 hopf subalgebras and multiplicative renormalization we shortly remark the connection between hopf subalgebras in the sense of definition 3 29 and multiplicative renor malization let q be a local qft as in definition 3 21 hq its renormalization hopf algebra andm c 1 the algebra of meromorphic functions in the variable called regulariza tion parameter consider feynman diagrams with fixed external momenta outside their landau singularities then feynman rules are a character from hq to the algebra of formal integral ex pressions and we can define integrated regularized feynman rules e for a given regularization scheme e with regulator as the map e hq m 7 f 139 where f is the meromorphic function obtained after regularizing the feynman integrand of via e and then integrating it for a suitable value of from this we can proceed and define renormalized feynman rules r for a given renormalization scheme r such that m r is a rota baxter algebra of weight 1 as the map r hq c m 7 lim 7 0 s e r e 140 where is the convolution product from definition 3 12 and s e r is the counterterm map recursively given via the normalization s e r i 1 m 1 c and on aug hq via s e r hq m 7 r s e r e p 141 where p is the projector onto the augmentation ideal from definition 3 11 we remark that the counterterm map as well as the z factors are only well defined for 6 0 as they consist of r divergent expressions if the renormalization hopf algebra hq possesses hopf subalgebras in the sense of definition 3 29 we can calculate the z factor for a given residue r rq via zre r s e r x r 142 more details in this direction can be found in 60 and in 61 62 using a different notation remark 3 31 hopf subalgebras and different gradings furthermore we remark that the ex istence of the hopf subalgebras from definition 3 29 depends crucially on the grading g in particular for the grading induced by the first betti number these hopf subalgebras exist if and only if the local qft has only one vertex for the coupling constant grading if and only if the local qft has for each vertex a different coupling constant and always for the residue grading 60 3 3 associating the renormalization hopf algebra to a local qft in this subsection we describe a problem which may occur in the construction of the renormal ization hopf algebra hq to a given local qft q using definition 3 21 then we present four different solutions to still obtain a renormalization hopf algebra which are not isomorphic if the problem occurs and discuss their physical interpretation problem 3 32 given a general local qft q definition 3 21 may not yield a well defined hopf algebra due to the following reason let q be such that there exist divergent feynman graphs gq whose residue is not in the residue set i e we have 0 and res rq then given any feynman graph gq with d the quotients of the form for are ill defined as they generate a new vertex res r 0 q as a consequence the definitions of the coproduct and the antipode are ill defined as well 30 remark 3 33 in order to remedy problem 3 32 we need to change some of the definitions this is explained in the following solutions 3 36 3 37 3 38 and 3 39 in order to distinguish the different objects we use script letters for the objects as defined in definition 3 21 and calligraphic letters for the modified definitions definition 3 34 feynman graphs generated by residue sets 2 let q be a local qft with residue set rq recall from definition 3 14 that we denote by gq the set of all one particle irreducible 1 pi feynman graphs 36 that can be generated by the residue setrq ofq moreover we define the set gq of all 1 pi feynman graphs of q which does not contain superficially divergent subgraphs whose residue is not in the residue set rq i e gq gq m m 1 m m n res m rq m m 0 143 this set will be used in solution 3 36 definition 3 35 set of superficially divergent subgraphs of a feynman graph 2 let q be a local qft and gq a feynman graph of q recall from definition 3 20 that we denote by d the set of superficially divergent subgraphs of and by d the set of superficially divergent proper subgraphs of moreover we define the two additional sets d and d corresponding to d and d respectively which do not contain feynman graphs with superficially divergent subgraphs whose residue is not in the residue set rq i e d d m m 1 m m n res m rq m 144 a and d d 144 b these sets will be used in solution 3 37 solution 3 36 the first solution to problem 3 32 to replace the feynman graph set gq from definition 3 14 by gq from definition 3 34 then we can construct the renormalization hopf algebra as in definition 3 21 which we now denote by hq solution 3 37 the second solution to problem 3 32 is to simply remove all divergent feynman graphs whose residue is not in the residue set from the sets of divergent subgraphs i e replace the sets d and d from definition 3 20 by d and d from definition 3 35 respectively then we can construct the renormalization hopf algebra as in definition 3 21 which we now again denote by hq solution 3 38 the third solution to problem 3 32 is to add all missing residues to the residue set and set its weights to the value of a divergent feynman graph with this particular residue if there exist two or more such graphs with different superficial degree of divergence we take the highest for uniqueness although it suffices to be divergent this enlarges also the set of feynman graphs then we can define the hopf algebra using this enlarged set of feynman graphs as in definition 3 21 which we now again denote by hq 36 again we remark that the use of 1 pi feynman graphs rather than connected feynman graphs is justified by theorem 3 55 as is discussed in remark 3 56 31 solution 3 39 the fourth solution to problem 3 32 works only in special cases given that there exist tree diagrams with the residue of a divergent feynman graph whose residue is not in the residue set then we can construct the renormalization hopf algebra as in definition 3 21 with the only difference that we define the shrinking process of the aforementioned graphs by replacing them with the sum over the corresponding trees which we now again denote by hq we remark that this procedure is a priori non local but could be interpreted in the sense of a generalized slavnov taylor type identity remark 3 40 equivalently the hopf algebra from solution 3 36 could be constructed in two different ways the first possibility is to define hq as the q algebra generated by the set gq of feynman graphs with the multiplication and unit as in definition 3 21 then we define the ideal iq gq gq 145 generated by all divergent feynman graphs whose residue is not in the residue set and consider the the quotient hq hq iq 146 on which we can define the additional hopf algebra structures as in definition 3 21 the set of feynman graphs from the quotient hopf algebra hq is then precisely the set as defined in definition 3 34 the second possibility is to use the hopf algebra from solution 3 38 and consider the quotient by the ideal given as the sum of iq and the ideal generated by all feynman graphs with vertices which are not in the residue set rq which is a hopf ideal inside the hopf algebra from solution 3 38 via corollary 3 51 together with proposition 3 46 remark 3 41 physical interpretation physically problem 3 32 states that divergent feynman graphs whose residue is not in the residue set contribute in principle to a divergent green s function which cannot be renormalized if the corresponding vertex is missing in the local qft however there could be still three possibilities that the unrenormalized feynman rules remedy the problem themselves the first one is that the problematic feynman graphs itself or the corresponding restricted combinatorial green s functions turn out to be in the kernel of the unrenormalized feynman rules which corresponds to solution 3 36 the second one is that the problematic feynman graphs itself or the corresponding restricted combinatorial green s functions turn out to be already finite when applying the unrenormalized feynman rules which corresponds to solution 3 37 however if this is not the case we need to add the corresponding vertices with suitable feynman rules in order to absorb the divergences of the corresponding restricted combinatorial green s functions via multiplicative renormalization corresponding to solution 3 38 luckily for all established physical local qfts this situation did not appear so far finally the last scenario could be still circumvented if corresponding tree graphs exist together with a generalized slavnov taylor type identity rendering this a priori non local process local which corresponds to solution 3 39 example 3 42 qed an illuminating example to problem 3 32 is qed since we need to apply both solution 3 36 and solution 3 38 consider qed with its combinatorics as a renormalizable local qft i e the superficial degree of divergence of a feynman graph depends only on its external leg structure then the feynman graphs contributing to the three and four point function are divergent however in contrast to non abelian quantum gauge theories there is no three and four photon vertex present to absorb the corresponding divergences luckily when summing all feynman graphs of a given loop order we have the following cancellations after applying the unrenormalized feynman rules the feynman graphs contributing to the three point function cancel pairwise due to furry s theorem cf theorem 3 55 for a generalization thereof and the divergences of the feynman graphs contributing to the four point function cancel 32 pairwise due to gauge invariance 63 thus qed is a renormalizable local qft after all without the need to add a three and four photon vertex to the theory remark 3 43 the situation of qgr qed the situation of qgr qed is worse than the one for qed since qgr is non renormalizable as a local qft in particular the superficial degree of divergence of a pure gravity feynman graph depends only on its loop number however for the two loop propagator feynman graphs considered in this article the generalization of furry s theorem given in theorem 3 55 suffices since feynman graphs with self loops in the mathemat ical literature also known as roses vanish in the renormalization process in particular this ensures that the graviton photon 2 point function vanishes which would be in principle possible via quantum correction whose corresponding feynman graphs are divergent due to the super ficial degree of divergence furthermore we remark that there exist also graphs whose external leg structure consists of any combination of even numbers of matter particles such as four pho ton or four fermion graphs as they could be glued together via gravitons for this scenario we suggest solution 3 39 to avoid introducing the corresponding vertices as the corresponding trees are already part of the theory the corresponding generalized slavnov taylor type identities will be studied in future work definition 3 44 renormalization hopf algebra associated to a local qft let q be a local qft then we denote byhq one of the following hopf algebras if definition 3 21 is well defined we denote hq the renormalization hopf algebra of definition 3 21 otherwise we denote by hq the hopf algebra obtained after applying solutions 3 36 3 37 3 38 or 3 39 to definition 3 21 we call hq the renormalization hopf algebra associated to q remark 3 45 the motivation for definition 3 44 is to simplify notation as for the realm of this work it is not necessary to distinguish between solutions 3 36 3 37 3 38 and 3 39 3 4 hopf ideals and the renormalization hopf algebra recall the definition of a hopf ideal from definition 3 10 now we study general properties of hopf ideals and then specialize to the renormalization hopf algebra associated to a local qft to this end we prove general results for hopf ideals and a condition for hopf ideals in the renormalization hopf algebra which yields some particular hopf ideals as corollaries this is of physical interest since symmetries generating hopf ideals have a similar subdivergence structure and are thus compatible with their renormalization treatment in particular we show that the ideal generated by all feynman graphs having at least one self loop rose is a hopf ideal this is useful as these feynman integrals vanish for kinematic renormalization schemes and can thus already be set to zero in the renormalization hopf algebra proposition 3 46 sums of hopf ideals are hopf ideals let h be a hopf algebra over a field with characteristic zero and in nn 1 be a set of n non empty hopf ideals where n n 1 then the sum i n n 1 in 147 i e the ideal i generated by sums of the generators of all hopf ideals in the set in n n 1 is also a hopf ideal in h i e i satisfies 1 i h i i h 2 i i 0 3 s i i 33 proof this follows directly by the linearity of the involved maps proposition 3 47 special products of hopf ideals are hopf ideals let h be a hopf algebra over a field with characteristic zero and in nn 1 be a set of n non empty hopf ideals where n n 1 and k 1 n then the special product i k n n 1 in ik 148 i e the ideal i k generated by products of the generators of all hopf ideals and the sum of a particular hopf ideal in the set in nn 1 is also a hopf ideal in h i e i k satisfies 1 i k h i k i k h 2 i i k 0 3 s i k i k proof this follows directly by the linearity and multiplicativity of the involved maps proposition 3 48 condition for hopf ideals 37 let q be a local qft with residue set rq and hq its renormalization hopf algebra 38 let furthermore s gq be a non empty set of feynman graphs and denote via is s hq 149 the ideal generated by the set s 39 then is is a hopf ideal i e is satisfies 1 is hq is is hq 2 i is 0 3 s ir is if and only if the set s is such that for all graphs s and for all corresponding graphs d we have that either s or s proof by the multiplicativity of the coproduct and the antipode i e 1 2 1 2 150 and s 1 2 s 1 s 2 151 for 1 2 hq it suffices to check all three conditions on the level of generators i e let s then the first property follows from the definition of the coproduct d hq is is hq 152 37 a similar result was found independently in 64 38 defined either via definition 3 21 or if this definition fails as described in problem 3 32 via one of the solutions described in solutions 3 36 3 37 3 38 and 3 39 cf definition 3 44 39 in general is will not be finitely generated 34 the second property follows directly from the fact that s 6 and thus is 6 finally the third property follows from the normalization s i i and the recursive definition of the antipode s d s is 153 corollary 3 49 ideals generated by self loops are hopf ideals given the situation of propo sition 3 48 we denote by ss gq the set of all feynman graphs being or containing at least one self loop rose i e ss gq 0 1 1 1 154 furthermore we denote by is the ideal generated by the set ss in the renormalization hopf algebra hq then is is a hopf ideal in hq proof let ss be a generator of is i e there exists at least one subgraph s which is a single self loop and let d d then we have either s d or s d and thus either d ss or d ss finally applying proposition 3 48 finishes the proof remark 3 50 we remark that self loop graphs are in the kernel of the renormalized feynman rules for kinematic renormalization schemes i e it makes physically sense to set them already in the renormalization hopf algebra to zero corollary 3 51 ideals generated by residues are hopf ideals given the situation of proposi tion 3 48 and let r rq be a residue then we denote by sr gq the set of all feynman graphs in hq having residue r or having a subgraph with residue r i e sr gq res r 155 furthermore we denote by ir the ideal generated by the set sr in the renormalization hopf algebra hq then ir is a hopf ideal in hq proof let gq be a generator of ir i e there exists at least one subgraph r with res r r and let d d then the following three situations can occur 1 r d 2 r d 6 and r d 3 r d observe that for each respective situation we have 1 r d and thus d sr 2 r d r d and res r d r r and thus d sr 3 r d and thus d sr finally applying proposition 3 48 finishes the proof 35 remark 3 52 corollary 3 51 states that it is compatible with renormalization to set all feynman graphs with a given residue to zero in the corresponding renormalization hopf algebra remark 3 53 proposition 3 46 and proposition 3 47 state that in the case of the renormalization hopf algebra associated to a local qft special linear combinations of feynman graph sets sn nn 1 which each individually generate hopf ideals in sn h again generate hopf ideals these results will be used e g in 60 to study the renormalization of general local quantum gauge theories similar to 65 66 3 5 the renormalization hopf algebra of qgr qed now we examine renormalization hopf algebra associated to qgr qed cf definition 3 44 furthermore we proove a generalization of furry s theorem in theorem 3 55 which also in cludes external gravitons and graviton ghosts this is in particular useful since the calculation shows that for the two loop propagator combinatorial green s functions given explicitly in sub section 4 1 all divergent subgraphs whose residue is not in the set rqgr qed are either of this type or belong to the ideal generated by self loop graphs roses thus when constructing the renormalization hopf algebra of qgr qed for the realm of two loop propagator graphs we first consider the quotient via the ideal generated by all amplitudes captured via gener alized furry s theorem as in solution 3 36 and then consider the quotient via the hopf ideal generated by all self loop graphs finally we conclude that all graphs that are set to zero in the construction of the renormalization hopf algebra of qgr qed are in the kernel of the renormal ized feynman rules this is due to the fact that self loops vanish in kinematic renormalization schemes and the generalized furry s theorem in the following fermion edges are denoted by photon edges by graviton edges by photon ghost edges by and graviton ghost edges by remark 3 54 residue set of qgr qed recall from definition 3 13 how to obtain the corre sponding residue set rqgr qed from the qgr qed lagrange density lqgr qed 1 2 2 r 1 4 e 2 g g f f i u 1 m m dvg lgf lghost 156 which was introduced in subsection 2 2 as we restrict the residue set to o 2 in this article we obtain the following finite residue set rqgr qed it splits as usual into a disjoint union of vertex residues r 0 qgr qed and edge residues r 1 qgr qed i e rqgr qed r 0 qgr qed qr 1 qgr qed 157 concretely we have r 0 qgr qed 158 a and r 1 qgr qed 158 b 36 furthermore their corresponding weights and coupling constants read 1 cpl 1 159 a 2 cpl 1 159 b 2 cpl 1 159 c 2 cpl 1 159 d 2 cpl 1 159 e 0 cpl e 159 f 2 cpl 159 g 1 cpl 159 h 2 cpl 159 i 2 cpl 159 j 0 cpl e 159 k 1

r be the residue of an amplitude set p r to be the sum of its external photon and photon ghost edges and f r to be the number of external fermion edges then the corresponding restricted combinatorial green s functions xrr are in the kernel of 37 the unrenormalized feynman rules qgr qed for each residue grading r individually if p r is odd and f r is zero 40 proof this proof is the only part of this article where we need to consider explicitly the orien tation of fermion edges we denote by afurryqgr qed the set of all amplitudes with residues ri such that p ri is odd and f ri is zero furthermore let c gqgr qed gqgr qed 7 c 160 be the fermion charge conjugation operator on feynman graphs i e c is the feynman graph with the orientation of all fermion lines reversed notice that c is an involution moreover let denote the corresponding feynman rules then we denote c c 161 observe that we can factor c on the level of feynman rules into two commuting operations i e c crco cocr 162 where cr alters the feynman rules to fermion charge conjugated residues and co reverses the order of the dirac matrices now let gqgr qed be a feynman graph with res afurryqgr qed then we immediately have c cr 163 as traces of dirac matrices are invariant under a reversion of their order now we analyze the action of cr on the feynman rules acting on individual residues we claim that the residue set rqgr qed splits into a disjoint union rqgr qed r qgr qed qr qgr qed 164 such that we have for all residues r r qgr qed cr r r 165 a and for all residues r r qgr qed cr r r 165 b indeed reversing the fermion particle flow is equivalent to reversing the fermion momentum i e replace it by its negative since the corresponding feynman rules are either independent or linear in fermion momenta the independent ones belong to the set r qgr qed and the linear ones to the set r qgr qed in particular it follows from the structure of the lagrange density given in equation 72 that this property is independent of the number of gravitons attached to a vertex residue thus it suffices to check this property on the level of propagator and three valent vertex residues obviously residues without fermions are independent of fermion momenta and thus belong to the set r qgr qed as is the photon fermion antifermion vertex residue contrary the fermion propagator and the graviton fermion antifermion vertex residue 40 obviously it is then also true for the other two gradings presented in definition 3 25 as the residue grading is the finest 38 are linear in the fermion momenta and thus belong to the set r qgr qed in total we obtain where r 0 3 qgr qed stands for three valent vertices r 0 3 qgr qed 166 a r 0 3 qgr qed 166 b and r 1 qgr qed 166 c r 1 qgr qed 166 d now let r afurryqgr qed and we consider corresponding combinatorial green s functions x r r for some residue grading multi index r we claim that the involution c is fixed point free when restricted to xrr by abuse of notation now considered as a set to show this claim we first observe that the photon fermion antifermion vertex with an arbitrary number of gravitons attached to it is the only residue which allows to change p r thus the requirement on p r being odd implies that every feynman graph xrr has at least one fermion loop thus c applied to any feynman graph xrr is not the identity and furthermore c xrr since residues and gradings are preserved by c finally we claim that for xrr the sum c is in the kernel of the feynman rules i e c 0 167 we conclude this by showing that in this case is build from an odd number of residues belonging to the set r qgr qed and thus c 168 which directly implies equation 167 by the linearity of the feynman rules indeed since res afurryqgr qed we conclude that has to consist of an odd number of photon fermion antifermion modulo an arbitrary number of gravitons vertices and thus in particular at least one closed fermion loop as noted before since the fermion loops are closed as contains no external fermion edges the number of fermion propagators equals the number of fermion vertices moreover we remind that photon fermion antifermion modulo an arbitrary number of gravitons vertices are in the set r qgr qed whereas fermion propagators and gravitons fermion antifermion vertices are in the set r qgr qed but as we need to have an odd number of photon fermion antifermion modulo an arbitrary number of gravitons vertices by the previous argument needs to have an odd number of residues from the set r qgr qed which finishes the proof remark 3 56 theorem 3 55 also justifies the restriction of connected feynman graphs to 1 pi feynman graphs in definition 3 14 and definition 3 34 more precisely since the amplitude of the two point vertex function of a photon and a graviton vanishes the set of connected feynman graphs which are not 1 pi is a trivial extension of the set of 1 pi feynman graphs 39 4 combinatorial green s functions the coproduct structure and obstructions to multiplicative renormalization in qgr qed now we consider the coproduct structure on the two loop propagator graphs in qgr qed we associate to qgr qed its renormalization hopf algebra hqgr qed as was described in subsection 3 5 let furthermore xrc be the combinatorial green s function with residue r rqgr qed and multi index c z 2 as was defined in definition 3 27 the multi index c introduced in definition 3 24 is defined such that c m n corresponds to a graphs with coupling constants of order o men with m n z in the following subsections we present the corresponding green s functions and their coproducts we remind that fermion edges are denoted by photon edges by graviton edges by photon ghost edges by and graviton ghost edges by in this work we draw oriented feynman graph edges i e fermion photon ghost and graviton ghost edges without orientation this is understood as the sum of all feynman graphs having all possible orientations 4 1 combinatorial green s functions in qgr qed now we present the restricted combinatorial green s functions non symmetric graphs are drawn only once but with the corresponding multiplicity 41 we remark that in the realm of two loop propagator graphs only one graph in x 2 2 equation 194 contains a problematic subgraph which however is captured by generalized furry s theorem stated in theorem 3 55 and thus is presented in brackets below we also present the one loop two and three point amplitudes which are set to zero due to generalized furry s theorem x 0 2 169 x 2 0 170 x 0 2 1 2 171 x 2 0 172 x 0 2 0 173 x 2 0 1 2 1

for a study of these relations on a general level to 60 we only remark here that equation 229 requires that the one loop photon propagator with a fermion loop is convergent this is not true and thus shows that qgr qed is a priori not multiplicative renormalizable using only two coupling constants one for the electric charge and one for the gravitational coupling this problem could be resolved by the introduction of two gravitational couplings one for the pure gravity part and one for the gravity matter coupling however this is part of a more general theme and could be also resolved if additional symmetries are present which will be studied in future work 5 conclusion in this article we considered quantum general relativity coupled to quantum electrodynam ics qgr qed first we introduced the necessary differential geometric background and the lagrange density of qgr qed in section 2 then in section 3 we introduced hopf algebras in general and the connes kreimer renormalization hopf algebra in particular furthermore we discussed a problem which can occur when associating the renormalization hopf algebra to 52 a given local qft and discuss possible solutions moreover we examine hopf ideals inside the renormalization hopf algebra which represent the symmetries compatible with renormalization next the application of these general results to qgr qed is discussed in particular a gen eralization of furry s theorem including external gravitons and graviton ghosts is formulated and proved in theorem 3 55 this is in particular useful since the calculations showed that besides from pure self loop feynman graphs which vanish in kinematic renormalization schemes these are the only graphs which need to be set to zero when constructing the renormalization hopf algebra of qgr qed for two loop propagator graphs then in section 4 we present all combinatorial green s functions for the one and two loop propagator graphs and the one loop three point functions then their coproduct structure is presented for which the coproduct of 155 feynman graphs has been computed using this result we presented and discussed the obstructions to multiplicative renormalization for qgr qed we remark the following connections to further research in this direction a detailed treatment of the feynman rules for quantum general relativity coupled to the standard model is examined in 30 as was mentioned in remark 2 26 furthermore the effects of gauge symmetries on renormalization are studied in 60 which results in generalizations of ward takahashi and slavnov taylor identities 20 21 22 23 24 as was mentioned in subsection 4 3 finally it will be studied if it is possible to define a corolla polynomial in this setting 67 68 69 70 71 72 which would then create the amplitudes of qgr qed from scalar 34 theory acknowledgments the author thanks dirk kreimer helga baum and the rest of the kreimer group for illuminating and helpful discussions
