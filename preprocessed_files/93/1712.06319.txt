paper is devoted to the study of the stability and stabilizability of heat equation in non cylindrical domain the interesting thing is that there is a class of initial values such that the system is no longer exponentially stable the sys tem is only polynomially stable or only analogously exponentially stable then the rapid exponential stabilization of the system is obtained by the backstepping method key words non cylindrical domain heat equation stability exponential stabiliza tion 1 introduction and main results it is well known that the stability and stabilization problems for both linear and non linear partial differential equations have been studied extensively see 1 4 references therein in general the study of stability for a given system is along the following way we first concern whether the solution is stable or not then if it is unstable we try to find a control to stabilize the system and if the solution decays in a slower rate one wants to force the solution to decay with arbitrarily prescribed decay rates they are called stability stabilization and rapid stabilization respectively there are many methods to study the stabilization including pole placement the control lyapunov function method the backstepping method and so on the backstep ping method which was initiated in 5 and 6 has been used as a standard method for this work is partially supported

backstepping method to parabolic equations was first given in 7 and 8 in the last decade the backstepping method has been widely used to study the stability of partial differential equations such as wave equation korteweg de vries equation and kuramoto sivashinsky equa tion see 9 11 the scheme of backstepping method is as follows initially an exponentially stable target system is established then the pde system is trans formed to the target system by using a volterra transformation at the same time the pde describing the transformation kernel is obtained thus the stabilization prob lem is converted to the well posedness problem of the kernel and the invertibility of transformation finally an explicit full state feedback control is given to demonstrate successful stabilization of the unstable system many problems in the real world involve non cylindrical regions such as controlled annealing of a solid in a fluid medium 12 vibration control of an extendible flexible beam 12 phase change and heat transfer the pde in the non cylindrical domain has close relation with equations of time dependent coefficients the typical system with time dependent coefficients is given by the czochralski crystal growth problem 13 which is presented as a heat equation with time dependent coefficients hence the research on the problem of non cylindrical region has important practical signif icance time dependent domain and coefficients lead to more complexities and diffi culties in most papers concerning stabilization systems are considered in cylindrical domains only few results have been found for systems in non cylindrical domains see 12 14 15 in 12 the authors considered the problem of the stabilization and the control of distributed systems with time dependent spatial domains the evolution of the spatial domains with time is described by a finite dimensional system of ordinary differential equations depending on the control namely the dynamical behavior of the distributed system is controlled by manipulating its spatial domain the length of the time interval is finite in 14 stabilization of heat equation with time varying spatial domain is discussed the well posedness of the kernel which depends on time t is proved by successive approximation there is a restriction on the boundary of moving domain more precisely the boundary function l t is analytic and the jth partial derivative satisfies jt l t m j 1 j j 0 if the boundary is unbounded with respect to t then the assumption in 14 does not hold in 15 the authors extended the backstepping based observer design in 14 to the state estimation of parabolic pdes with time dependent spatial domain as far as we know the stability and stabilizability of parabolic equation in unbounded non cylindrical domain have not been discussed in detail yet in this paper we mainly focus on the stability and rapid stabilization of the one dimensional heat equation in non cylindrical domain let us begin with the following 2 system ut uxx 0 in qt u 0 t 0 u l t t 0 in 0 u x 0 u 0 x in 0 1 1 1 where qt x t x 0 l t t t 0 l t 1 kt 0 k 0 the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the parabolic equations in non cylindrical domains are investigated in 16 the following lemma can be proved by the method in 16 lemma 1 1 if u 0 x l 2 then system 1 1 has a unique weak solution u in the following space c 0 l 2 t l 2 0 h 10 t and there exists a positive constant c independent of u 0 and qt such that u l 0 l 2 t u l 2 qt c u 0 l 2 moreover if u 0 h 10 then system 1 1 has a unique strong solution u in the class c 0 h 10 t l 2 0 h 2 h 10 t h 1 0 l 2 t and there exists a constant independent of u 0 and qt such that u l 0 h 10 t ut l 2 qt c u 0 h 10 the proof of lemma 1 1 will be given in appendix in what follows the definitions of the stability for system 1 1 are given definition 1 1 system 1 1 is said to be exponentially stable if for any given u 0 l 2 there exist c 0 0 and t 0 0 such that for every t t 0 u l 2 t ce t system 1 1 is said to be analogously exponentially stable if for any given u 0 l 2 there exist c 0 c 1 0 t 0 0 and with 0 1 such that for every t t 0 u l 2 t ce c 1 t and system 1 1 is said to be polynomially stable if for any given u 0 l 2 there exist 0 t 0 0 and c 0 such that for every t t 0 u l 2 t c t where t is a polynomial with respect to t it is easy to see that the exponentially stable system must be analogously expo nentially stable and the analogously exponentially stable system must be polynomially stable we can get by energy estimate that system 1 1 is polynomially or analo gously exponentially stable what we want to know is that whether the polynomially or analogously exponentially stable system is exponentially stable or not the con clusion is that the corresponding solution u is only polynomially stable for 1 2 more precisely the l 2 norm of solution has a polynomial lower bound for some initial values and system 1 1 is only analogously exponentially stable for 0 1 2 because we can also find a lower bound of the solution hence we have the following theorems 3 theorem 1 1 system 1 1 is only polynomially stable for 1 2 theorem 1 2 system 1 1 is only analogously exponentially stable for 0 1 2 remark 1 1 it is well known that the heat equation on the cylindrical domain is ex ponentially stable if 1 then the boundary is a line it can be seen by theorem 1 1 that the system is polynomially stable as long as the boundary of the domain is tilted a little bit namely k is small enough when the boundary of the domain is inclined steeply so that it is close to the x axis i e k is large enough the system is still poly nomially stable but if the boundary is 1 kt 0 1 2 system 1 1 is only analogously exponentially stable the relation between the stability and the boundary curve is shown in figure 1 figure 1 the relation between the stability and the boundary curve since system 1 1 decays slower than exponential decay rate the goal of this paper is to construct a control to force the solution to decay at a desired rate it is easy to see that there exists an internal feedback control leading to exponential decay however we are interested in looking for boundary feedback control to stabilize the system exponentially let us consider the system with boundary control ut uxx 0 in qt u 0 t 0 u l t t u t in 0 u x 0 u 0 x in 0 1 1 2 where qt x t x 0 l t t t 0 l t 1 kt 0 1 k 0 the well posedness of solutions to 1 2 can be obtained from the results in 16 and lemma 1 1 lemma 1 2 assume u t h 1 0 and l t u t l 2 0 if u 0 x l 2 system 1 2 has a unique weak solution u in the class c 0 l 2 t l 2 0 h 1 t 4 moreover if u 0 x h 1 and u 0 1 u 0 then system 1 2 has a unique strong solution u in the class c 0 h 1 t l 2 0 h 2 t h 1 0 l 2 t the proof of lemma 1 2 will be shown in appendix theorem 1 3 assume that u 0 l 2 0 1 then there exists a boundary feedback control u t h 1 0 such that system 1 1 decays exponentially to zero remark 1 2 when the growth order of l t is more than 1 the linear feedback control does not work however we can not deduce that the system is not stabilized exponen tially by feedback control because of the variety of feedback control this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the stability of 1 1 is established while in section 3 the feedback stabilization of 1 2 for 0 1 is proved at last the appendix is given in section 4 2 the stability of 1 1 lemma 2 1 let us assume that u 0 c u 0 0 12 then there is some t 0 such that the solution of system 1 1 satisfies u l 2 0 l t c 1 kt t t 0 where c depending on k t 0 and 0 depending on k proof of lemma 2 1 1 let u 0 x sin x e x 2 4 assume that u x t sin x 1 kt ec x t is the solution of the following system ut uxx 0 in qt u 0 t 0 u l t t 0 in 0 u x 0 u 0 x in 0 1 2 1 where 1 2 by straightforward computations we get that the partial derivatives are u t kx 1 kt 1 cos x 1 kt ec x t sin x 1 kt ec x t c t u x 1 kt cos x 1 kt ec x t sin x 1 kt ec x t c x 2 u x 2 2 1 kt 2 sin x 1 kt ec x t 2 1 kt cos x 1 kt ec x t c x sin x 1 kt ec x t c x 2 2 c x 2 2 2 5 substituting 2 2 into the equation in 2 1 and comparing the coefficients of sine and cosine one has the equation satisfied by c x t as follows c x kx 2 1 kt c t 2 1 kt 2 2 k 2 x 2 4 1 kt 2 k 2 1 kt 2 3 when 1 2 integrating 2 3 respect for x and t respectively we obtain c x t c 0 t kx

2 1 is u sin x 1 kt 1 kt 2 2 k e k 2 2 x 2 t 4 1 kt e k x 2 4 2 5 now let us estimate the norm u 2 l 2 0 l t 1 kt 0 sin x 1 kt 2 1 kt 1 kt 2 2 k e k 2 2 x 2 t 2 1 kt e k x 2 2 dx 1 kt 2 2 k 1 kt 1 kt

where c 1 2 k 3 2 1 8 8 the inequalities y 2 e y 2 y k 2 1 kt 2 1 8 k 2 1 kt 2 0 e y 2 2 dy 8 hold for t t 0 due to the facts lim y ye y 2 0 0 e y 2 dy 2 combining 2 7 and 2 8 we derive that u l 2 0 l

then the corresponding solution v is only polynomially stable for any u 0 c u 0 0 there exists a v 0 such that u 0 v 0 let w u v we have that w is the solution of the following system wt wxx 0 in qt w

clear that the comparison principle holds therefore w 0 in qt since v 0 in qt we get u v 0 in qt then we arrive at u l 2 0 l t v l 2 0 l t c 2 1 kt 2 k 1 kt 3 2 t t 0 if 1 2 u 0 c u 0 0 we have similar estimate hence we can take 2 k 3 2 for 1 2 and 2 for 1 2 corollary 2 1 let us assume that u 0 c u 0 0 0 12 then there is some t 0 such that the solution of system 1 1 satisfies u l 2 0 l t c 1 1 kt 2 e c 2 t 1 2 t t 0 where c 1 c 2 0 depending on k t 0 proof of corollary 2 1 the proof can be obtained by a simple modification of the first step in the proof of lemma 2 1 indeed integrating 2 3 for 0 1 2 we also have 2 9 2 10 and 2 11 namely u 2 l 2 0 l t c 3 e 2 2 k 1 2 1 kt 1 2 1 1 kt 2 14 due to 0 1 2 1 we get that u l 2 0 l t c 4 1 kt 2 e c 2 1 kt 1 2 c 4 1 kt 2 e ct 1 2 t t 0 2 15 thanks to the inequality a b a b if a 0 b 0 0 1 the last inequality in 2 15 holds proof of theorem 1 1 8 set x 1 kt y y 0 1 w y t u 1 kt y t system 1 1 can be rewritten as wt k ywy 1 kt wyy 1 kt 2 0 in q w 0 t w 1 t 0 in 0 w y 0 u 0 y in 0 1 2 16 where q y t y 0 1 t 0 system 2 16 is a variable coefficient parabolic equation in the cylindrical domain q the stability will be shown by the classical energy estimate multiplying 2 16 by w and integrating with respect to y we get 1 2 d dt 1 0 w 2 dy k 2 1 kt 1 0 w 2 dy 1 1 kt 2 1 0 w 2 ydy 0 2 17 let e t 1 0 w 2 dy by poincare s inequality we see that 1 2 d dt e t k 2 1 kt e t c 1 kt 2 e t 0 2 18 for a suitable c 0 using gronwall inequality we deduce that for 1 2 e t e 0 1 kt 2 c k 2 19 consequently u l 2 0 l t e t 1 2 u 0 l 2 0 1 1 kt 2 c k u

thanks to 1 kt 1 2 kt 1 2 we get u l 2 0 l t u 0 l 2 0 1 e c 1 1 kt 1 2 k 1 2 c 1 e c 2 t 1 2 9 hence in the case of 0 1 2 1 1 is analogously exponentially stable in the sense of l 2 norm then in view of corollary 2 1 we complete the proof of theorem 1 2 corollary 2 2 let l 1 t 1 kt 1 l 2 t 1 kt 2 0 1 2 1 t x 0 x l 1 t 2 t x 0 x l 2 t u 0 h 10 0 1 u 0 0 u 0 0 suppose l t is a smooth curve between line l 1 t and l 2 t l 0 1 let t x 0 x l t if the solutions corresponding to l 1 t and l 2 t are only polynomially or analogously exponentially stable then the solution of 1 1 with u 0 and boundary curve l t is only polynomially or analogously exponentially stable proof of corollary 2 2 denote by u 1 the solution corresponding to u 0 and l 1 t and u 2 the solution corresponding to u 0 and l 2 t assume u 1 and u 2 are only polynomially stable denote the solution corresponding to u 0 and l t by v we have that v 1 t 0 is the solution of the following system vt v 0 in 1 t 0 v 0 t 0 v l 1 t t t

we get v u 1 0 in 1 t 0 then we arrive v l 2 t v l 2 1 t u 1 l 2 1 t c 1 1 kt t t 0 similarly c 2 1 kt 2 2 u 2 l 2 2 t v l 2 t t t 0 the solution v is only polynomially stable 3 exponential

in 14 as a matter of convenience proof of lemma 3 1 multiplying the equation in system 3 1 by w integrating from 0 to l t with respect to x we get 1 2 d dt l t 0 w 2 dx wwx l t 0 l t 0 w 2 xdx l t 0 w

unbounded as time t tends to infinity we need to restrict the growth of l t in order to guarantee the exponential stability of solution it is readily to verified that the solution is exponentially stable for 0 1 because the following inequality u l 2 0 l t w 0 l 2 0 1 e t 1 2 1 2 l t w 0 l 2 0 1 e t 1 2 1 kt e 1 2 k t 2 3 18 holds for t t 0 if t 0 is large enough and k 2 hence we build a feedback control law to force the solution of the closed loop system to decay exponentially to zero with arbitrarily prescribed decay rates it can be also checked that the feedback control belongs to

the regularity of heat equation similarly one can also prove l t u t l 2 0 for large enough in conclusion we should take 25 k 2 in order to guarantee the exponential stabilizability u t h 1 0 and l t u t l 2 0 remark 3 1 the well posedness of solution to system 1 2 with the feedback control can be see from the well posedness of solutions to system 3 1 and system 3 8 remark 3 2 when the growth order of l t is less than 1 such as l t 1 ln 1 t l t 1 sint the linear feedback control does work from 3 17 remark 3 3 since the pde on the non cylindrical domain can be converted to the equation with time dependent coefficients the results of this paper may be extended to some parabolic equations with time dependent coefficients for which the explicit expression of the kernel can not be obtained these are problems which we will consider next 4 appendix let us start with the following system ut uxx f x t in qt u 0 t 0 u l t t 0 in 0 t u x 0 u 0 x in 0 1 4 1 where qt x t x 0 l t t t 0 t l t 1

to the uniform estimate and non blow up property of the solution we get that the existence domain of the solution is 0 lemma 1 1 follows from lemma 4 1 and lemma 4 2 directly and we also obtain the well posedness of the following system ut uxx f x t in qt u 0 t 0 u l t t 0 in 0 u x 0 u 0 x in 0 1 4 9 where qt x t x 0 l t t t 0 l t 1 kt k 0 0 lemma 4 3 if u 0 l 2 f l 2 0 h 1 t there exists a

such that u 2 l 0 h 10 t u 2 l 2 0 h 2 t c u 0 2 h 10 f 2 l 2 0 l 2 t 4 11 proof of lemma 1 2 system 1 2 can be converted to system 4 9 by the trans formation u u x l t u t and u is the solution of u
