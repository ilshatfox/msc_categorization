controllability result to trajectories of a simplified model of motion of a rigid body in fluid flow unlike a previously know results such a trajectory does not need to be a stationary solution 1 introduction and main results the paper is concern with the following controllability problem in the bounded domain q 0 t a b a 0 b x x 0 x 1 we consider the system of semilinear heat equations g 1 x

t 0 functions w 1 w 2 are connected through the boundary conditions 1 3 w 1 x 0 0 w 2 x 0 0 x 1 w 1 x 1 w 2 m x 0 w 1 x 0 0 r x 0 on 0 t where r is a given function m is a positive constant on the lateral boundary of cylinder q functions w 1 w 2 satisfy the dirichlet boundary conditions 1 4 w 1 x 0 b w 2 x 0 a 0 on 0 t the initial condition is 1 5 w 0 x 1 w 0 x 1 on here w w 1 for x q w 2 for x q function u x is the control distributed over domain q 0 t d b d 0 b supp u q one of the physical applications of system 1 1 1 4 is the rigid body moving through the fluid flow where wj is velocity

distributed control u such that at moment t for the given target function w 2 we have 1 6 w t x 1 w 2 x 1 on we make the following standard assumptions 1 7 1 a 1 b 1 c 1 q 2 a 2 b 2 c 1 q c 1 l 0 t l

satisfies 1 9 and 1 10 since it is well known that the controllability problem 1 1 1 6 can not be solved for an arbitrary target function w 2 we introduce the additional condition condition 1 there exist a pair w w 1 w 2 h 1 2 q h 1 2 q and control u l 2 q suppu q such that g 1 x w 1 g 2 x w 2 f 1 u f 2 w 1 w 2 x 0 0 x 1 w 1 x 1 w 2 m x 0 w 1 x 0 0 r x 0 0 on 0 t w b w a 0 on 0 t w t w 2 our main result is the following theorem 1 1 let f 1 l 2 q f 2 l 2 q r l 2 0 t suppose that assumptions 1 6 1 10 and condition 1 for functions f 1 f 2 r holds true w 0 h 10 then there exists a positive 0 such that if w 0 w 0 h 10 the controllability problem 1 1 1 6 has solution w u h 1 2 q h 1 2 q c 0 0 t h 10 l 2 q suppu q 3 theorem 1 1 was established for the case w 0 with control located at both ends in 5 and at one end in 12 another physical application of the controllability problem 1 1 1 6 describes to rods connected by a point mass see 6 for details of the model the zero null controllability for this model was proved in 7 for the case when coefficients j aj b cj are constants and recently in 1 when coefficients j aj b cj are space dependent functions the method of both papers based on the analysis of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and therefore can not be applied to the case of time dependent coefficients the n dimensional generalization for linear parabolic equations with time independent coefficients was studied by j l russeau with co authors in 14 exact controllability of similar problem for linear 1 d hyperbolic equations in case of one point mass attached was proved by s hansen and e zuazua in 8 and for several mass attached case by s avdonin and j edwards in 2 the proof of the theorem 1 1 is based on the implicit function theorem and null controllability result for the linearized system 1 1 1 4 the null controllability of the linearized system follows from the observability estimate observability estimate is obtained by carleman

the equation 2 8 keeps the same form after change of variables but the new coefficient 1 satisfies 1 2 on 0 t 0 let f x c 1 2 q q be the diffeomorphism of q on q such that f f 1 f 2 and f 1 x x 0 on q in order to construct the function f 2 consider a function q x 0 c 1 0 t q x 0 c 0 on 0 t set 0 b q c 0 0 t 40 let 1 x 1 c 0 b 1 x 1 x 1 on 0 0 d 1 dx 1 0 on 0 b 1 b 5 for x 1 4 b 5 b and d 1 dx 1 0

1 x 0 w 1 2 x 1 w 1 b 1 x x 1 w 1 c 1 w 1 f 1 with 1 0 b 1 c 1 c and f 1 f 0 observe that on 0 t 0 2 x 1 w 1 2 x 1 w 1 q 2 x 0 so 1 x 0 1 x 0 q 2 x 0 then taking q 2 x 0 2 x 0 0 2 x 0 0 we obtain that the function given by formula x 1 for x q 2 for x q 6 o yu imanuvilov is continuous on q equations 2 10 are transformed to 2 12 w 1 x 0 0 w 2 x 0 0 q x 0 x 1 w 1 x 1 w 2 m x 0 w 1 x 0 0 r x 0 0 on 0 t hence instead of proving the observability estimate to system 2 1 2 4 it suffices to prove the observability estimate for the following system 2 13 p x d u x 0 u 2 x 1 u b x x 1 u c x u f in q 0 t 0 2

proof without loss of generality using the standard arguments see e g 9 we can prove an estimate 2 22 under assumption b c 0 first by an argument based on the partition of unity e g lemma 8 3 1 in 9 it suffices to prove the inequality 2 22 locally by assuming that 2 23 supp u b x where b x is the ball in r 2 of the radius 0 centered at some point x let c 0 12 2 be a nonnegative function such that 2 24 2 t 1 for all t r 1 for existence of such a function see e g 15 set u x u x x 0 where 2 25 x 0 2 2 1 x 0 1 4 where c 0 t 0 t 4 x 0 3 t 4 t t x 0 x 0 x 0 0 on 0 t 2 x 0 x 0 0 on t 2 t 2 x 0 t 2 0 2 26 observe that it suffices to prove the carleman estimate 2 22 for the function u instead of u provided that the constant c 1 and the function s 0 are independent of observe that if g rm is a
