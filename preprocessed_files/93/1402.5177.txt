based on the dynamical decoupling mechanism then we derive two kinds of dynamical decoupling schemes periodic dynamical decoupling pdd and uhrig dynamical decoupling udd we select the non diagonal element of density matrix as a reference index and investigate the behavior of quantum coherence of the type n level atom under these two dynamical decoupling schemes proposed at last we choose a type

systems optimized dynamical decoupling simulation experiment control methods bang bang operation mathematical and computational methods 1 introduction in the quantum world the coherence and entanglement are the sources of power that make quantum computation 1 surpass classical computation but quantum systems always interact with their surrounding environment realistically to some extent no matter how weak the coupling is the evolution of the quantum system is eventually plagued by non unitary features like decoherence and dissipation 2 decoherence destroys the coherence of the quantum superposition states in the process of evolution and results in the reduction or even erosion of the entanglement between subsystems the design of strategies being able to protect the evolution of a quantum system against decoherence represents a challenging conceptual issue in recent years many strategies have been proposed to counteract the effects of environmental couplings successfully in open system evolutions dynamical decoupling 3 known as quantum bb control is one of the universal methods originally introduced in order to overcome decoherence errors it makes use of the coherent averaging effects 4 and uses the twin born tailored powerful pulses to average out the effect of unwanted hamiltonian but up to now the dynamical decoupling pulse sequences are almost designed based on dividing the total evolution time into equidistant time periods it has been further shown that in principle it is possible to use optimized pulse sequences 5 6 in 5 the udd was discussed in the spin boson model and the potential of non equidistant pulse sequences was demonstrated by concatenated pulse sequences in 6 but the high dimensional systems have attracted much interest for their applications in quantum control and quantum computation 7 so the related researches in high dimensional systems are needed to be studied this paper will study the effectiveness of the optimized dynamical decoupling scheme udd in arbitrary n level atom in configuration the key point is to put on the comparison of the effectiveness of suppressing the decoherence between the standard periodic dynamical decoupling scheme pdd 3 and udd toward this goal we first study the dynamics of a decoherence type n level atom driven by dynamical decoupling and design the corresponding bb operation group of the dynamical decoupling scheme then according to different time intervals between the adjacent bb pulses two decoupling schemes pdd and udd are designed and then select the non diagonal element of density matrix 3 8 as a reference index to investigate the behavior of quantum coherence of mathematical and computational methods in science and engineering isbn 978 960 474 372 8 28 the type n level atom under dynamical decoupling schemes at last a type six level atom is taken as an example the numerical simulation is carried out and the analysis is given the paper is arranged as follows in section ii a brief derivation of the dynamical decoupling mechanism in arbitrary n level atom in configuration is presented and the corresponding bb operation group is designed then pdd and udd are introduced in section iii the behavior of quantum coherence of the type n level atom under two dynamical decoupling schemes is investigated then the numerical simulation of a type six level atom is carried out and a comparison of the results is analyzed in section iv we give a brief summary and close by discussing possibilities for future work 2 dynamical decoupling mechanism the core ideology of dynamical decoupling which is termed as quantum bb control is to eliminate the interaction hamiltonian with the bath from the total hamiltonian for the whole system it uses the tailored unitary pulses the impulsive full power operations and can be turned on off for negligible amount of time with ideally arbitrarily large strength to average out the interaction hamiltonian between the quantum system and the bath which results in decoherence each pulse in the pulse sequence represents a unitary bb operator and the pulse sequence represents a bb operation group thus the key point to design the bb control field is to design the bb operation group and the operators in bb operation group should be the least so in this section we first design the bb operation group under the phase decoherence in an arbitrary n level atom with configuration then according to different time intervals between the adjacent bb pulses we derive two decoupling schemes pdd and udd 2 1 the design of bb decoupling operators consider an arbitrary n level atom in configuration we assume that the dynamics between the bath and the system can be described by the following interaction hamiltonian 8 2 1 1 0 ki n i i i i sb ki z ki x ki ki ki i ki h c b j a j a 1 where kic and kib are the coefficients of the relative magnitude of the phase decoherence and the amplitude decoherence respectively and kij are the coupling constants for virtual exchanges of excitations with the thermal reservoirs according to the changes of kic and kib we can conclude from 1 that 1 if 0 0 ki kic b then the reservoir is an adiabatic reservoir which results in the amplitude damping 2 if 0 0 ki kic b then the reservoir is a thermal reservoir which results in the phase damping 3 if 0 0 ki kic b then the reservoir is a general reservoir which results in the general decoherence suppose energy exchange processes typically involve time scales much longer than decoherence mechanisms we neglect the effects associated to quantum amplitude damping 9 in such a case the interaction hamiltonian can be got if we choose 1 0 ki kic b for simplicity and it can be written as 2 1 0 ki n i i sb z ki ki ki i ki h j a j a 2 assume that the bb operation group is expressed as mg g 1 2 1 m g where g represents the number of the operations and mg is a constant pulse matrix suppose a quantum system has the evolution time t and divide t into n cycles ct according to the core ideology of dynamical decoupling we apply the bb operation group mg g to eliminate the unwanted hamiltonian sbh in 2 in every decoupling cycle and the dynamic decoupling condition can be expressed as 1 0 1 0 g m sb m m g h g g 3 in 10 the bb operation group to suppress the phase decoherence in an arbitrary n level atom with mathematical and computational methods in science and engineering isbn 978 960 474 372 8 29 configuration was designed and it can be written as 1 2 1 ng i g g g in which g n i represents a unit matrix with order n 1 2 1 ng g g can be expressed as 1 0 1 1 2 1 1 2 exp i 2 exp i 2 exp i 2 exp i 2 k k x x k k n n x x g 4 a 2 12 1 1 1 n ng g g g 4 b from the above analysis one can see that there are n g bb operators pluses in the evolution time t let it 1 2 i n g represent the moments when the bb operators are produced so except that there is a operator at n gt t in the time interval 0 t the number of the pluses m is 1 m g n 5 according to different choices of it one can obtain many kinds of dynamical decoupling schemes next we ll introduce the periodic dynamical decoupling pdd and uhrig dynamical decoupling udd 2 2 periodic dynamical decoupling pdd periodic dynamical decoupling pdd is the basic dynamical decoupling scheme it uses the twin born tailored powerful pulses periodically to average out the effect of unwanted hamiltonian sbh and achieves the purpose of decoupling with the environment the bb operation group g is designed to satisfy the dynamic decoupling condition 3 and set i it t 1 2 1 1 2 0 1 m mi m in which the time moments it with the pulses of m can be written as 1 i i pddt t t i m 6 1 i pdd i m 1 2 i m 7 2 3 uhrig dynamical decoupling udd the uhrig dynamical decoupling udd 5 is an optimized dynamical decoupling scheme proposed by uhrig it also uses the twin born tailored powerful pulses to average out the effect of unwanted hamiltonian sbh and achieves the purpose of decoupling with the environment the bb operation group g in udd is also designed to completely cancel errors up to the first order in the magnus expansion and should satisfy the dynamic decoupling condition 3 this is just the same with pdd but the difference from the pdd is that udd optimizes the time intervals between adjacent pulses and the it with the udd pulses of m can be expressed as 5 i i uddt t 8 2 sin 2 2 i udd i m 1 2 i m 9 3 behavior of quantum coherence under various dynamical decoupling schemes in order to investigate the performance of suppressing decoherence of these dynamical decoupling schemes we first derive the trend of the non diagonal element of density matrix to observe the evolution of the type n level atom under dynamical decoupling schemes then we choose a type six level atom as a model for system controlled and derive the trends of the non diagonal element of density matrix while pdd and udd are applied respectively and finally make a comparison and analysis of the results 3 1 evolution of a type n level atom under dynamical decoupling schemes in order to analyze easily the impact of the decoupling pulse sequence transform the system into the interaction picture then the interaction hamiltonian in 2 can be expressed as mathematical and computational methods in science and engineering isbn 978 960 474 372 8 30 2 i i 1 0 ki

the bb operators kg in 4 we can program a cycle of pulse sequence as 1 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 n n n ng g g g g g g g so we get a cycle of the unitary evolution of the atom system under the bb operations as the

let c jt represent the length of the j th decoupling cycle then one can get o s c j j jt t t let ijt and jt i i 1 2 n represent the moment of the pulse 1 i ig g and the i th time interval of the adjacent two pluses in the jth decoupling cycle and one can have 1 i ij j jt i t t then consider in the total evolution time t after applying periodically the decoupling operations kg in 4 in n

relevant quantity is the qubit coherence ijs t i j and of course 0 ij ijs st to observe the suppression effect of the bb decoupling pulse sequences on the atom of the adiabatic decoherence we are interested in calculating the reduced density matrix of the atom in this work we choose and calculate the non diagonal element 01 s t for simplicity the other non diagonal elements ijs t i j can also be chosen but they are not discussed here we assume that the atom and environment are initially uncorrelated i e 0 0 0 s b 14 where 0 b is a kind of thermal equilibrium state at temperature t i e 0 1 k k kk a a b k e e where 1 bk t bk is the boltzmann constant and t is the temperature of the bath and one can choose henceforth units such that 1 bk for simplicity then combined with 11 14 one obtains

get different jt i and c jt 1 when pdd is applied one has 0 0 pdd 1 n n pdd 19 a 1 j m pdd m pddt i t 19 b where 1 m j n i i 1 2 n j 1 2 n 1 2 c j j j jt t t t n 19 c 2 when udd is applied one has 0 0

c j m t t i t t p t 23 from 23 one can see that p t represents the attenuation ratio of the non diagonal element 01 0 s at the moment t under dynamical decoupling schemes and none control schemes respectively it is easy to see that when p t is closer to 1 the better suppression of decoherence will be got thus we can observe the curves of the function p t to mathematical and computational methods in science and engineering isbn 978 960 474 372 8 32 understand the loss of the quantum coherence when pdd and udd are applied respectively and in part b the numerical simulations will be carried out in a six level atom in configuration 4 illustration example and result analysis consider a six level atom in configuration as shown in fig 1 the six levels are labeled as 0 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively and their energies are 0 e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 e and 5 e the level k is coupled to the level 1 k via the fields of resonance frequencies 1 k k 0 1 4 k respectively we place the atom under the driving of five fields with frequencies of 1 1 j j j je e 1 5 j respectively similarly we define frequencies 2 2 0 5 0 j j j j nj j 2 3 5 j fig 1 a six level atom in configuration under five driving fields with frequencies 10 21 32 43 and 54 according to part a here one can have 6 n thus from 22 one can obtain 5 1 exp m j c j m p t t i t t 24 now insert 19 and 20 to 24 respectively the numerically simulation experiments of the function p t under pdd and udd with the same other simulation parameters are done and the results are shown in fig 2 in fig 2 the dotted line represents the evolvement of p t while pdd is applied the solid line represents the evolvement of p t while udd is applied the correlated parameters are 0 25 150 kt 50 n and 100 hzc from fig 2 one can see that under the same parameters udd gets better performance of suppressing decoherence than pdd the results reveal that udd is optimized it means that udd enhances the possible storage time by up to several times below a certain threshold of the loss of the quantum coherence and the number of pulses required to obtain a certain prolongation of the storage time with udd can be much smaller than the number with the standard scheme pdd fig 2 the curves of p t while applying pdd and udd 4 conclusion we have investigated the suppression of decoherence of an arbitrary n level atom in configuration by means of the dynamic decoupling methods in this paper through the comparison simulation experiments the results show that udd offers superior performance to pdd over a range of experimentally relevant parameters such as the temperature of the bath t the cycle number n the cut off frequency c and the strength of the system environment interaction it means that the optimized scheme udd can obtain more storage time than the standard one pdd below a certain threshold of the loss of the quantum coherence when the same number of pulses are applied this is very helpful to practical implementations of quantum computation and by selecting the non diagonal mathematical and computational methods in science and engineering isbn 978 960 474 372 8 33 element of density matrix as a reference indicator the comparison of the results also reveal that udd enhances the possible storage time by up to several times below a certain threshold of the loss of the quantum coherence alternatively the number of pulses required to obtain a certain prolongation of the storage time can be much smaller than the number in the standard scheme pdd compared to the standard equidistant pulse sequences it is easy to see that the optimized dynamical decoupling scheme udd is just finding a good way to optimize the time intervals between the adjacent bb pulses so it will be interesting to research how to optimize the time intervals between the adjacent bb pulses we have also completed the researches on suppression of general decoherence in arbitrary n level atom in configuration under bang bang control 15 and an optimized dynamical decoupling strategy to suppress decoherence 16 the more study on quantum system control can be find in 17 5 acknowledgments this work was supported in part by the national key
