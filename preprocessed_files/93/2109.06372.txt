tracking control for multi agent systems using broadcast signals based on positive realness yasushi amano tomohiko jimbo and kenji fujimoto abstract stochastic broadcast control is a control method for networked multi agent systems in this approach each agent autonomously determines its own behavior control input via a probabilistic mechanism using only the signal sent from the central controller without communicating with the other agents accordingly it is useful for systems with numerous agents or systems whose agents cannot communicate with each other however in engineering applications it is difficult to manage the behavior of each agent to solve this problem this paper proposes a deterministic broadcast control method that makes a specified output signal follow the reference signal while letting the agents take different actions therefore the agents make it possible to generate the autonomous behavior by deterministic mechanism since the differences of the behavior of the agents can be adjusted by selecting the design parameters it is possible to assign their behavioral tendency in advance further this paper proves the asymptotic stability of the proposed control system via hyperstability theory when the tracking error with respect to the reference signal is large all agents are active in control and when the error is small each agent autonomously decides whether to be inactive stop or to be active according to its own behavioral tendency while ensuring that the overall system tracks the reference signal finally numerical experiments are presented that verify the system can achieve the objective for various reference signal or environment index terms asymptotic stability broadcast control deterministic mechanism passivity tracking control i introduction the internet of things iot and cyber physical systems 1 2 enable high device device functionality and efficiency through the exchange of information between devices via the internet examples of such systems include energy systems such as power control systems in smart grids 3 6 collaborative systems involving multiple robots 7 10 multi motor systems 11 13 and traffic systems such as traffic lights 14 16 these are all multi agent systems in which it is difficult to realize centralized control by collecting and processing all the information in one place accordingly it is necessary to design multi agent systems that achieves goals by distributed control moreover in distributed control it is desirable to minimize the communication between agents to reduce the communication devices and data processing system it is also desirable for the agents to track any reference signal and to be robust against variation of the plant system and external disturbances there are a lot of research on distributed control of multi agent systems some examples of distributed control are consensus control to match the state of each agent on the network 17 18 coverage control to place agents in space to generate a specified distribution 19 20 and distributed optimization in which the state variables of the agents are controlled to optimal values by only using on local information related to constraints and evaluation functions 21 22 in such methods only neighboring agents communicate with each other accordingly communication devices are required whereas such devices would increase the cost to overcome such problems broadcast controllers have been proposed 23 26 in this approach the controllers achieve tracking control by using the measurement of the tracking error only without communication among agents this approach is effective for systems with numerous agents or systems in which communication between agents is difficult moreover in broadcast control each agent has the y amano and t jimbo are with the toyota central r d labs inc nagakute japan e mails e 0738 mosk tytlabs co jp t jmb mosk tytlabs co jp k fujimoto is with graduate school of engineering kyoto university kyoto japan e mail k fujimoto ieee org same local controller and determines the control input value autonomously by using the same broadcast signal that is sent simultaneously to all the agents the behavior of each agent depends on its initial state which limits achievable desired behavior to avoid this problem some methods using stochastic local controllers have been proposed ueda et al 23 reported that the control objective can be achieved using stochastic control of the on off contraction movement of a muscle by only using the measurement of the difference between the desired length and the current length of the muscle azuma et al 24 25 and ito et al 26 have also reported that problems such as coverage control can be handled using stochastic broadcast control the broadcast control is effective for the system with numerous agents however engineering applications do not always have numerous agents for example an energy management system has many power sources agents and a multi motor system has some motor agents in each of these situations it is easy to design a local controller based on the characteristics of each agent however for agents that operate stochastically it is difficult to design the local controller since its behavior is stochastic when the local controller can be design as described above the following becomes possible for an energy management problem in which the demand power is generated by multiple power sources it is desired to use all the power sources when the required power is large and to stop the inefficient power sources when the required power is small when generating power using a generator internal combustion engine etc the efficiency generally decreases if the power supply is low owing to the effects of mechanical losses such as friction therefore it is beneficial in terms of efficiency to stop unnecessary power sources in addition in a multi motor system it is generally inefficient to generate small torque in the motor to achieve the purpose consequently it is desired that motors specified beforehand for example according to the efficiency stop and remaining motors produce the desired torque cooperatively in other words it is useful for each agent to divide the roles of starting stopping and output adjustment automatically the roles of agents can be preset by the design parameters to ensure the reliability of multi agent systems it is necessary to prove their stability especially in a target tracking problem the asymptotic stability to assure that the output of the system tracks the reference signal as stable analysis methods applicable to multi agent systems previous studies 27 29 have proposed methods based on passivity the passivity is an effective tool to consider the stability of a multi agent system for example parallel coupling of passive systems also satisfies passivity furthermore those methods are applicable to nonlinear systems as well such a passivity based approach only proves input output stability of the closed loop system but it does not ensure asymptotic stability in contrast in real life environments living organisms realize distributed control based automatic division of roles which is the aim of the present study a representative example of such control is gait control in multi legged animals and some studies are being conducted to elucidate the underlying control principle owaki et al 30 31 previously proposed autonomous distributed control methods to realize collaboration among the legs of four legged robots such controls can generate gait patterns that is realize division of roles for the legs such as which leg is the support leg and which is free by using only the information about each leg moreover it has also been stated that such control can generate various gait patterns depending on the walking speed that is these approaches can automatically generate the division of roles for the legs depending on the walking speed however those studies focus exclusively on reproducing the principles of gait in living organisms and applying them to control thus system stability was not investigated this paper proposes a multi agent system with a deterministic decentralized controller that achieves to track the reference signal the proposed system has the following features 1 each agent uses no information of other agents 2 each agent decides its action using the broadcast signal only 3 the behavioral tendency of each agent can be designed by control parameters furthermore we analyze the stability of the proposed control system and clarified the conditions under which the tracking error converges to zero the proposed control method achieves that a single output signal follows the reference using the control inputs generated by multiple agents for example a multi motor system to control the torque of one output shaft or an energy management system to realize the desired power with multiple power sources the proposed agent consists of a switching variable which is an integral of the tracking error and a switching function which defines the control input based on the switching variable this approach enables the agents to produce different outputs even if all agents use the same broadcast signal moreover a sufficient condition for the tracking error to converge to zero is given further it is possible to design a division of roles that completely stops some agent when they are not necessary in addition we propose a method of producing a continuous control input to reduce the oscillations generated by switching multiple control inputs the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section formulates the problem section presents the details of the proposed method and the proof of stability section outlines the numerical experiments conducted and analyzes the results obtained section v discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method and its issues section

system as shown in fig 1 p is the plant system and c is the controller consisting of the multi agent system the p can be expressed as follows p p p p p p p p p p 1 and is assumed to satisfy assumption

symmetric matrices q r and p r and l r 1 n w r satisfying the following conditions p t p p p t t 2 p 2 2 moreover the multi agent system c is configured as shown in fig 2 where the input r p is the broadcast signal and p is the output and r r is the reference signal and the control input p is set as the sum of p generated by agents c i 1 2 3 m as follows p p 1 3 fig 2 controller gc b control objective in this study the output p of the plant system tracks its reference signal r that is the control problem is to design c s so that the following becomes to zero r p 4 here the following assumption is made regarding r assumption 2 is assumed to be the output of r p r p r r p r p r 5 where r is a constant and r may be time varying not necessarily constant to be able to track the above reference signal r it is assumed that the control input satisfies the following conditions assumption 3 min r max where min min 1 max max 1 min is the minimum input of p and max is the maximum input of p for this control problem the objective of this study is to propose agents c that satisfies the following specification 1 the input of each agent c is only the tracking error e specification 2 the output p of plant tracks the reference signal r that is p r as specification 3 the agents c have design parameters to adjust their behaviors of tendency in advance e g whether they are easy to stop or not iii decentralized control using broadcast signal this section proposes a distributed control law that satisfies the three specifications given in section ii b using only broadcast signals firstly the error system can be obtained from 1 and 5 as follows p p p p 6 where r p r p then the closed loop system can be represented as shown in fig 3 let the output of ce be 7 p 1 c p p p c 1 c c fig 3 error system a autonomous switching controller asc here we refer to the idea of the gait control law described in 30 31 the gait control law consists of a mechanism to generate phase differences between legs using nonlinear oscillators to express inter leg coordination based only on the information about each leg and a switching mechanism to switch between the free and supporting legs that is to determine the sections in which control is inactive and active respectively in this paper we exclude the nonlinear oscillator from the mechanism proposed in 30 31 and propose agents that feeds back only the broadcasted error fig 4 p p 0 n 0 8 fig 4 autonomous switching controller asc the control law in 8 is referred to as an autonomous switching controller asc equation 8 consists of the dynamics that generate the phase of each agent and the switching function that expresses the role assignment function here p and n can be freely designed within the range min n r p max that satisfies assumption 3 in addition to design the behavioral tendency of each agent a variable gain 0 0 9 is introduced where and are positive functions satisfying 0 in the proposed method the asc with p n and is designed such that the role sharing among the agents is generated based on the characteristics and constraints of the actuators for the agents c with 8 and 9 the following theorem holds theorem 1 consider the error system described by equations 6 and 7 using the agents c described by equations 3 8 and 9 and suppose that the system satisfies assumptions 1 2 and 3 then the tracking error satisfies 0 proof see appendix a 1 for the proof when there exists some agents to let stop completely the n is set as 0 in 8 furthermore when 0 it is necessary to immediately set as p n 0 however from 8 p is determined based on the sign of the which is the integral of the error in other words there exists a delay until 0 becomes true after 0 becomes true therefore in the proposed controller in 8 the gain in 9 is set to be a large value to reduce the delay furthermore even if some agents failures p 0 the stability is guaranteed by theorem 1 if assumption 3 is satisfied b autonomous smooth switching controller assc due to the role assignment function the tracking error become discontinuous and oscillatory therefore to reduce the output oscillation we propose agents c below consisting of a function that continuously interpolates the role assignment function in 8 by as p p p c n p n n 10 here c is a non decreasing function that changes continuously from n to p taking c n n 0 c 0 0 and c p p 0 the control law in 10 is referred to as an autonomous smooth switching controller assc the proposed assc method has the design parameters p n c and in the system shown in fig 4 where c of 10 is used theorem 2 holds theorem 2 consider the error system described by equations 6 and 7 using the agents c described by equations 3 9 and 10 and suppose that the system satisfies assumptions 1 2 and 3 then the tracking error satisfies 0 proof see appendix a 4 for the proof iv numerical experiments this section demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method described in sections iii a and iii b in comparison with the controller in fig 5 which is a simplified version of the distributed controller 4 commonly known as an automatic generation control agc p 11 here the gain is a positive design parameter hereafter the controller in 11 is referred to as an integral controller see appendix 3 for the stability of the system using 11 fig 5 decentralized integral control a conditions let us consider the control problem associated with making the output p of the second order system given by the following equation and tracking the reference signal r using ten agents 10 p 1 0 2 1 0 p 12 where is the laplace variable 1 98 0 4900 1 75 and 0 4900 for the control input p in 11 the maximum value is p 3 and the minimum value is n 0 for the above objects numerical experiments were conducted under the following conditions 1 condition 1 verification of tracking performance the reference signal yr was switched stepwise two stage specifically yr 28 was set for the time interval 0 t 0 2 s and yr 10 was set for the time interval 0 2 t 0 4 s 2 condition 2 verification of fault tolerant performance in this case it was supposed that the control inputs p for five agents 1 5 suddenly became zero at 0 2 s owing to some malfunctions note that the reference signal r was set as r 10 at all time remark how to set r as any constant value the reference signal r is the output of 5 for a constant input in other words using 12 r becomes r 1 0 1 0 r 1 0 r r 1 0 r 13 therefore if r is constant the initial state r 0 can be set as r 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 r 0 1 r 14 then r 0 and r becomes a constant value r 1 0 0 1 r 0 r 15 b integral controller results the design parameters of the integral controller in 11 are 5 2 0 2 1 and the initial values of the agents are 0 0 for 1 2 10 we set all the initial values the same to show that their behaviors change even if they are originally identical the gain with small number is set to be large that is the control input is prone to change to make the comparison conditions the same as those in the proposed method we imposed the upper and lower limits of control input fig 6 shows the control results under condition 1 the control inputs generated by agents 1 5 are represented by solid lines and those generated by agents 6 10 are represented by dotted lines in the first half of 0 to 0 2 s of fig 6 a the output p did not track the reference signal r because some agents had small gains sufficient input did not be generated even if the error was large in addition in figs 6 b and c the change patterns of the agents were the same even if the agents had different gains in other words the integral controller in 11 with different gains did not generate a clear division of roles fig 6 integral control results a output p and reference signal r b c control input generated by b agents 1 5 c agents 6 10 c asc results the design parameters of asc in 8 and 9 were for 1 2 10 5 2 0 2 1 0 0 and 0 1 0 2 1 0 and 0 16 here the agents with small numbers are prone to be active that is they select p because of the large values of on the other hands the agents with large numbers are prone to be inactive that is they select n because of the small values of and larger than for 0 and 0 let the initial values of the agents be 0 0 1 2 10 figs 7 and 8 show the control results under conditions 1 and 2 respectively here the behaviors of agents 1 5 are represented by solid lines and those of agents 6 10 are represented by dotted lines in fig 7 when the reference signal was set to a large value in the first half of 0 to 0 2 s the agents selected p 3 and became active in the region where r p after exceeding the target value agents 9 and 10 selected n 0 and became inactive after that agents 1 8 selected p and the other agents 9 and 10 switched p and n alternately in other words the agents with small selected not only n but also p according to the tracking error fig 7 asc results condition 1 a output p and reference signal r b phase of each agent c d control input generated by c agents 1 5 d agents 6 10 fig 8 asc results condition 2 a output p and target r b phase of each agent c d control input generated by c agents 1 5 d agents 6 10 in the second half of 0 2 to 0 4 s as shown in fig 7 the reference signal was set to a small value in the region where before reaching the target value the agents with large number selected n became inactive after that agents 6 10 stopped in most region because did not increase since was small and was larger than when 0 and 0 agents 1 3 selected in most region and agent 4 switched between and alternately and the agents 5 selected in other words the agents designed to be prone to stop selected and the remaining agents were adjusted to achieve the tracking control as a result the roles of agents were automatically assigned without receiving individual commands in addition from 9 the output was adjusted to track the reference signal by switching between p and n on the other hand in condition 2 fig 8 even when agents 1 5 broke down at 0 2 s p 0 agent 6 automatically selected p and the other agents 7 10 switched between p and n 0 to track to the reference d assc results the design parameters of assc in 10 were set to 16 as well let the initial values of the agents be 0 0 1 2 10 furthermore the switching function was c p p n n n 0 p 0 06 17 the switching function connected p and n with a straight line in addition p was set to a small value to clarify the division that is to select either p or n fig 9 shows the control results under condition 1 in fig 9 behaviors of agents 1 5 and 6 10 are represented by solid and dotted lines respectively comparing figs 7 a and 9 a it was apparently that the output oscillations were suppressed this suppression occurs because as shown in figs 9 c and d there were agents that selected intermediate values other than p and n between 0 and 0 2 s when the reference signal was large agents 1 7 selected agents 8 10 selected intermediate values or meanwhile when the reference signal was small between 0 2 and 0 4 s agents 6 10 selected n and agents 1 5 selected intermediate values from to in transient state in steady state agent 1 3 selected agent 4 selected intermediate values and agent 5 selected therefore the division of roles based on the predesigned behavioral tendencies was expressed and tracking control was achieved while reducing the oscillation fig 9 autonomous smooth switching controller assc results condition 1 a output p and target r b phase of each agent c d control input generated by c agents 1 5 d agents 6 10 v discussion the multi agent system c proposed in this paper achieves the tracking control by autonomously assigning roles to different agents according to the magnitude of the reference signal or the fault such that causes some agents to be zero in addition by changing the control parameters the behavioral tendencies of the agents such as active or inactive are designed in advance more specifically the behavior of the agent which is determined based on the broadcast signal only is changed by adjusting the dynamic response of the variable by setting the gain conventional broadcast control is an effective method for a system composed of many agents but involves a probabilistic search process therefore it is difficult to control the behavior of each agent as mentioned above the proposed method allows the movement of each agent or group of agents to be specified which makes it easier to manage the agents furthermore by the smooth switching controller oscillations of outputs in the steady state are suppressed without impairing the automatically division of roles such as active or inactive vi conclusion in this paper we proposed a deterministic controller for a multi agent system that tracks a reference signal using the sum of the control inputs from several agents and proved that the tracking error is asymptotically stable further we realized a broadcast controller without introducing any stochastic mechanism to enable the multi agent system to generate the division of roles the proposed methods enable the construction of efficient and reliable systems for a multi motor system the failure of one motor can be automatically compensated by the other motors and the motors can be turned on according to their efficiencies for an energy management system with multiple power supply sources the shortage power can be compensated by starting dormant sources automatically and highly efficient sources can be used preferentially nevertheless the limitation of the proposed method is that the asymptotic stability is guaranteed for strictly positive real systems in the future we plan to relax this constraint and make it applicable to more general systems appendix a 1 proof of theorem 1 in the system shown in fig 3 if pe is strictly positive real and ce is passive the hyperstability theorem 32 33 guarantees the asymptotic stability of the error because pe is assumed to be strictly positive real it is sufficient to show that ce is passive firstly by introducing r 1 2 which is the share of each agent for the reference input r r 1 a 1 here because r is the share of each agent the value is always within the range between the maximum and minimum control inputs that is n r p using this r the output of c can be expressed as follows 1 p r a 2 where p regarding 8 and 9 the storage function c for the overall c and the storage function c of each agent can be defined as follows c c 1 c r 0 0 a 3 where is an arbitrary positive function satisfying the derivatives of c are c r r a 4 accordingly using a 3 the derivative of c can be expressed as follows c c 1 r 1 1 1 1 a 5 using 9 as 1 0 1 0 a 6 holds moreover according to the definition because the signs of and match 0 for 0 using a 6 we obtain 1 0 a 7 in addition because 0 for 0 using a 6 we obtain 1 0 a 8 accordingly the following is true c a 9 showing that is passive therefore the asymptotic stability of error that is 0 as is proven a 2 proof of theorem 2 as in theorem 1 the multi agent system c is passive and the storage function of each agent is given by c r 0 0 a 10 in the case of 8 as shown in fig 1 a if 0 then r p r 0 a 11 and if 0 then r n r 0 a 12 however when is made continuous smooth as shown in fig 1 b if p then r p r 0 a 13 holds but if p then r 0 a 14 is not necessarily satisfied similarly as shown in fig a 1 b if n then r n r 0 a 15 holds but if n then r 0 a 16 is not necessarily satisfied accordingly in a 10 it can not be said that c 0 across the entire region making it unsuitable for use as a storage function with respect to a 10 a new variable r is introduced and the storage function ci is given a new definition c r 0 0 a 17 r in a 17 is a function as shown in fig a 2 where for r 0 r r 1 r 1 r a 18 and for r 0 r r 1 r 1 r a 19 are defined fig a 1 a two stage and b smooth switching fig a 2 definition of r for a uri 0 and b uri 0 based on the above definitions the derivative of the storage function c in a 17 can be expressed as follows c r r r r r r 1 r r r r 1 r r r r r 1 r r r a 20 where next r is defined as follows r r 1 a 21 with regard to 10 if the storage function for the overall c is defined as c c 1 a 22 then using a 20 and a 21 the derivative of c can be expressed as c r r 1 1 r 1 a 23 here we define a new function u as u r r 0 0 a 24 the derivative function u is u r r r r a 25 substituting the above equation into the second term on the right hand side of a 23 we obtain r r 1 u 1 1 a 26 next integrating both sides of a 23 over time interval 0 1 provides c 1 c 0 1 r 1 1 0 1 0 r r 1 1 0 a 27 based on the definitions of in 10 and in a 6 0 1 0 0 1 0 a 28 furthermore by the definition of r 1 0 0 0 r 0 0 0 r 0 a 29 2 0 0 0 r 0 0 0 r 0 a 30 hence the second term on the right hand side of a 27 is non positive substituting a 26 into the third term on the right hand side of a 27 we obtain r r 1 1 0 1 u 1 0 1 a 31 where we introduce u which is the upper limit of u u u u 0 0 u 0 a 32 this changes a 31 to r r 1 1 0 u 1 0 1 a 33 here because is a positive design parameter there exists a positive constant kh which is the upper limit of 0 1 now let the initial time be 0 0 the end time be 1 and the interval in which u is a positive or non positive term be 1 1 2 where is the total number of intervals in which u is positive and non positive using the interval the right hand side of a 33 becomes u 1 0 1 u 1 u 0 u 2 u 1 1 u u 1 u u 0 1 a 34 at this point we have r r 0 when p or n so that u is u r r 0 rm 0 rm rm m a 35 here rm max min and m max p n therefore a 34 is u u 0 1 rm m a 36 thus r r 1 1 0 u a 37 where 0 u r m hence a 27 is c 1 c 0 1 0 u a 38 as c c 1 0 and u 0 vu 0 1 0 a 39 here 0 vu 0 c 0 u hence the passivity of c has been proven as a result the asymptotic stability of the error is compensated even for agent c in 10 a 3 stability of the integral controller system this section demonstrates that stability can be guaranteed even by using the integral controller of 11 theorem 3 applying c given by 3 and 11 to the error system defined by 6 and 7 and satisfying assumptions 1 and 2 the system is asymptotically stable and 0 as proof as in theorem 1 we show that the multi agent system c is passive we define the storage function c of ce in 11 as c 1 2 s p 1 r 2 a 40 here s 1 is a constant because r is a constant and from 3 and 7 the derivative of the storage function c is c 1 s p 1 r p 1 1 s p r 1 a 41 which demonstrates the passivity of ce thus the asymptotic stability of the error is compensated for agent c in 11 references 1 r poovendran k sampigethaya s k s gupta i lee k v prasad d corman and j l paunicka special issue on cyber
