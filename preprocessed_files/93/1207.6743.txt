metric was introduced to study stability robustness of feedback sys tems it induces the weakest topology in which feedback stability and perfor mance as measured by in terms of a closed loop induced norm are robust 1 24 22 26 28 29 in 24 georgiou showed the relationship between the gap metric and a particular two block h problem in 22 the authors showed that feedback optimization in the gap metric is equivalent to feedback op timization with respect to normalized factor perturbations they computed the largest possible uncertainty radius such that robust stability is preserved extensions to time varying systems have been proposed in 30 25 where a geo metric framework for robust stabilization of infinite dimensional time varying systems was developed the uncertainty was described in terms of its graph and measured in the gap metric several results on the gap metric and the gap topology were established in particular the concept of a graphable subspace was introduced in 10 some of the results obtained in 24 were generalized in particular the gap metric for time varying systems was generalized to a two block time varying optimization analogous to the two block h opti mization proposed in 24 this was achieved by introducing a metric which is the supremum of the sequence of gaps between the plants measured at ev ery instant of time the latter reduces to the standard gap metric for linear time invariant lti systems in 9 10 11 using the time varying gap metric it is shown that the ball of uncertainty in the time varying gap metric of a given radius is equal to the ball of uncertainty of the same radius defined by perturbations of a normalized 2 right coprime fraction provided the radius is smaller than a certain quantity in 11 lower and upper bounds are derived for computing the maximal sta bility margin quantified in the tv gap metric in terms of using coprime factorizations these bounds are equal to the maximal stability margin for lti systems in 20 the authors showed that the time varying tv directed gap reduces to the computation of an operator with a tv hankel plus toeplitz structure computation of the norm of such an operator can be carried out using an iterative scheme known to hold for standard two block h problems 20 the minimization in the tv directed gap formula was shown to be a minimum using duality theory in this paper we use the equivalence between uncertainty quantified in tv gap metric balls and coprime factor uncertainty for ltv systems we study the problem of robust stabilization for time varying normalized coprime factor perturbations and obtain operator theoretic results which generalize similar results in 13 22 26 known to hold for lti systems in particular we com pute an upper bound on the maximal achievable stability margin under tv normalized coprime factor uncertainty in terms of the norm of a tv hankel operator the upper bound reduces to the maximal stability margin for lti systems we point to a necessary and sufficient condition which guarantees compactness of the tv hankel operator and in which case singular values and vectors can be used to compute the tv optimal stability margin and tv controller therefore generalizing similar results obtained in 26 for lti sys tems to tv ones the technique developed to compute the upper bound also applies to the lower bound on the maximal achievable stability margin in the tv case to this end it suffices to restrict the relevant operators to a par ticular subspace computing an upper and lower bound allows the estimation of the optimal stability margin for ltv systems we point to an operator corona theorem connection which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a robustly stabilizing controller the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the gap metric is introduced in section 3 the relation between the tv gap metric and co prime factorization is discussed and computations in terms of operator theory are developed we conclude with a summary of our contribution in section 4 2 the time varying gap metric ltv systems may be regarded as causal linear possibly unbounded operators acting on 2 as multiplication operators to each plant p we associate its domain 3 d p u 2 px 2 1 an ltv plant p has a right coprime factorization if there exist operators m and n both in bc 2 2 such that p nm 1 and a left coprime factoriza tion if there exist m n bc 2 2 such that p m 1 n in addition there exist x y x y bc 2 2 such that xn ym i n x m y i 2 such factorizations exist if and only if p is stabilizable 27 there exist causal bounded linear operators u v u and v such that 27 v u n m m u n v m u n v v u n m i 0 0 i 3 all p stabilizing ltv controllers c can be parameterized as 27 c u mq v nq 1 v qn 1 u qm q bc 2 2 4 following 22 10 we are interested in normalized coprime factorizations that is m n is an isometry from 2 into 2 2 in this case m m n n i as is in the lti case where m n are the adjoint operators of m and n respectively 10 suppose that two ltv plants g 1 and g 2 have normalized right coprime fac torizations m 1 n 1 and m 2 n 2 respectively following 9 10 let 1 n denote the orthogonal projection on the range of m 1 n 1 i pn 2 n is defined similarly define n g 1 g 2 i pn 0 0 i pn 2 n 1 n 5 and n g 1 g 2 1 n 2 n max n g 1 g 2 n g 2 g 1 6 4 the directed time varying gap between g 1 and g 2 is then defined as g 1 g 2 sup n 0 n g 1 g 2 7 and the time varying gap 10 g 1 g 2 max g 1 g 2 g 2 g 1 8 the function is a metric and for time invariant systems reduces to the stan dard gap metric 9 let b p r denote the set of stabilizable ltv systems p 1 such that p p 1 r 9 denote by bs p r the set of all p with right coprime factorization nm 1 for which m m m 1 n 1 r 10 and such that m is invertible in the algebra of ltv systems then the follow ing result in 10 lemma 5 3 p 219 holds theorem 1 10 p 219 b p r bs p r 11 for r 1 inf q bc 2 2 v qn u qm theorem 1 relates coprime uncertainty balls to balls defined in the time varying gap metric in particular maximizing the uncertainty radius for co prime uncertainty results in maximizing the uncertainty radius quantified in the tv gap metric in the next section we study the problem of robust stabi lization for time varying normalized coprime factor perturbations and obtain operator theoretic results which generalize similar results in 13 22 26 known to hold for lti systems this is equivalent to maximizing the uncertainty ra dius in the tv gap metric by theorem 1 and the results obtained here apply to uncertainty quantified in terms of the tv the gap metric as well 5 3 robust stabilization under coprime factor uncertainty if ropt is the supremum over all r such that c stabilizes bs p r or equivalently b p r then for tv systems the following inequality holds 11 p 257 inf n 0 inf q bc 2 2 u mq v nq i pn 1 ropt inf q bc 2 2 u mq v nq 12 for time invariant systems these numbers are equal in the same vein as 22 we define ro as the right hand side of 12 r 1 o inf q bc 2 2 u v m n q 13 we will see that the infimum is achieved for some qo bc 2 2 19 20 in the sequel we are concerned with solving the optimization 13 which re ciprocal is an upper bound for the optimal robustness radius the solution proposed applies as well to the lower bound in 12 by a restriction to a sub space that is by restricting the operators introduced in the sequel to the range of i pn i pn 2 the inequality 13 allows the estimation of ropt by computing a lower and upper bound the commutant lifting theorem clt has been proposed by sz nagy and foias 32 33 a time varying version which corresponds to nest or triangular algebras will be used and is discussed next following 3 34 a nest n of a hilbert space h is a family of closed subspaces of h ordered by inclusion the triangular or nest algebra t n is the set of all operators t such that tn n for every element n in n a representation of t n is an algebra homomorphism h from t n into the algebra b h of bounded linear opera tors on a hilbert space h a representation is contractive if h a a for all a t n it is weak continuous if h ai converges to zero in the weak topology of b h whenever the net ai converges to zero in the weak topol ogy of b h the representation h is said to be unital if h ih ih where ih is the identity operator on h and ih the identity operator on h the sz nagy theorem asserts that any such a representation h has a b h dilation that is there exists a hilbert space k containing h and a positive represen tation h of b h such that phh a h h a where ph is the orthogonal projection from k into h 34 3 we now state the clt for nest algebras 6 theorem 2 34 3 let h t n 7 b h h t n 7 b h be two unital weak continuous contractive representations with b h dilations h b h 7 b k h b h 7 b k respectively assume that x h 7 h is a linear operator with x 1 such that xh a h a x for all a t n that is x intertwines h and h then there exists an operator y k 7 k such that i y 1 ii y intertwines h and h that is y h a h a y for all a b h iii y dilates x that is y m 7 m and ph y m xph m where h m n is the orthogonal representation of h as the orthogonal differ ence of invariant subspaces for h t n and similarly for h observe that as in the time invariant case the operator z m n n m b 2 2 2 2 14 and the operator induced norm a b sup f 2 f 2 1 a b f 2 sup f 2 f 2 1 af 22 bf 2 2 1 2 a b b 2 2 2 15 is unitarily invariant that is for any unitary operator u b 2 2 2 we have u a b a b in particular for u z we have 7 u v m n q z u v m n q r q i 1 r q 2 1 2 16 where r m u n v b 2 2 next we show that ro 1 hr 2 1 2 17 where hr is the time varying hankel operator with symbol r note that as in the lti case 0 ro 1 to define the operator hr we need some mathematical preliminaries let qn i pn for n 1 0 1 where pn is the standard truncation operator which is also an orthogonal projection that sets all outputs after time n to zero and p 1 0 and p i then qn is a projection and we associate to it the following nest n qn 2 n 1 0 1 the space of causal bounded linear operators bc 2 2 can be viewed as a triangular or nest algebra which leaves invariant every subspace n n that is tn n t bc 2 2 in fact bc 2 2 can be written as bc 2 2 a b 2 2 i qn aqn 0 n 18 now call c 2 the class of compact operators on 2 called the hilbert schmidt or schatten 2 class 12 3 under the norm a 2 tr a a 1 2 define the space 8 a 2 c 2 bc 2 2 19 thena 2 is the space of causal hilbert schmidt operators operators inbc 2 2 may be considered as operators in bc a 2 a 2 and vise versa 34 define the orthogonal projection p of c 2 onto a 2 p is the lower triangular truncation or nest projection let 1 be the orthogonal projection on the subspace a 2 a 2 m n a 2 the orthogonal complement of m n a 2 in the operator hilbert space a 2 a 2 under the inner product a b tr b a a b a 2 a 2 in the following lemma the orthogonal projection 1 is computed explicitly lemma 1 1 i m n p m n 20 proof call k m n for z a 2 a 2 let us compute i kpk 2 z i kpk i kpk z i kpk kpk kpk pk z i 2 kpk kpk z since k k i and p 2 p i kpk z 21 so i kpk is indeed a projection clearly the adjoint i kpk of i kpk is equal to i kpk itself so that i kpk is an orthogonal projection next we show that the null space of i kpk ker i kpk ka 2 let z ker i kpk then i kpk z 0 z kpk z since k z c 2 then pk z a 2 and therefore z ka 2 hence ker i kpk ka 2 conversely let z a 2 then i kpk kz kz kpz kz kz 0 9 thus kz ker i kpk so ka 2 ker i kpk and therefore i kpk ka 2 and the lemma is proved following 18 an operator x in b 2 2 determines a hankel operator hx on a 2 if hxa i p xa for a a 2 22 for r b 2 2 2 the tv hankel operator solves the minimization 19 20 inf q bc 2 2 r q hr 23 where hr i p m u n v formula 23 is the time varying analogue of the standard nehari problem the following expression for ro was obtained in the lti case was obtained in 13 using state space techniques and in 22 using operator theory we will give its time varying counterpart and give an operator theoretic proof along the lines of 22 theorem 3 r 2 o 1 h m n 2 24 the quantity ro is a bound on the maximal achievable tv stability margin under coprime factor uncertainty for ltv systems and reduces to the maximal stability margin for lti system proof call s a 2 a 2 m n a 2 and define the operator a 2 7 s 1 u v 25 for the lower bound in 12 it suffices to restrict the operator to the subspace i pn a 2 using the clt 3 34 4 it follows r 1 o 26 to see this we need a representation of bc 2 2 that is an algebra ho momorphism say h respectively h from bc 2 2 into the algebra 10 b a 2 a 2 respectively bc s s of bounded linear operators from a 2 into a 2 respectively from s into s define the representations h and h by h bc 2 2 7 b a 2 a 2 h bc 2 2 7 bc s s 27 h a ra a bc 2 2 h a 1 ra a bc 2 2 where ra denotes the right multiplication associated to the operator a defined on the specified hilbert space by the sz nagy dilation theorem there exist dilations h respectively h for h respectively h given by h a ra on a 2 for a b 2 2 28 h a ra on a 2 a 2 for a b 2 2 29 the spaces a 2 and s can be written as orthogonal differences of subspaces invariant under h and h respectively as a 2 a 2 0 s a 2 a 2 m n a 2 30 now we have to show that the operator intertwines h and h that is h a h a for all a bc 2 2 h a 1 ra 1 u v a 2 1 ra u v a 2 1 u v ra a 2 h a applying theorem 2 implies that has a dilation that intertwines h and h i e h a h a a b 2 2 by lemma 4 4 in 34 is a left multiplication operator acting from a 2 into a 2 a 2 and causal that is lk for some k bc a 2 a 2 a 2 with k call u u v then 1 u 1 k which implies 1 u k 0 hence u k f m a 2 where m m n and for all f a 2 that is u k f m g g a 2 which can be written as m u k f g a 2 in particular m u k f bc 2 2 for all f bc 2 2 of finite rank 11 by theorem 3 10 3 there is a sequence fn of finite rank contractions in bc 2 2 which converges to the identity operator in the strong topology by an approximation argument it follows that m u k bc 2 2 let ting q m u k we have g qf we conclude that u k m q that is u m q k with k as required a consequence of the commutant lifting theorem is that there exists an op timal qo bc 2 2 such that the infimum in 13 is achieved moreover lemma 1 implies that the operator is given by the following analytic ex pression u v m n p m u n v 31 and the subspace s is given by s a 2 a 2 m n p m n a 2 a 2 32 next let be the left multiplication operator on s as s 7 a 2 n m s 33 then for x a 2 we have x u v x m n y s for some y a 2 and x n m u v x m n y x therefore i on s moreover for s s we have 12 s n m s n m s 1 s 2 m n s 3 for some s 1 s 2 and s 3 in a 2 now apply to get s u v n m s m n n m s which by 3 is equal to s u v n m s m n v u s and thus s s showing that i on s i on a 2 that is is the inverse of 1 this implies inf s s s 2 1 s 1 1 34 now note that the adjoint operator of is defined by a 2 7 s 35 x 1 n m x x a 2 and the tv hankel operator defined by a 2 7 c 2 c 2 a 2 a 2 a 2 2 i p n m 13 the subspace a 2 2 is the orthogonal complement of a a in c 2 c 2 consider the left multiplication operator n m defined from a 2 into c 2 which is isometric since we are using normalized coprime factorizations then for any x a 2 we have n m x p n m x i p n m x 1 n m x i p n m x x x but since i that is the operator is an isometry and 2 2 1 further i and so 1 i e is bounded below implying by definition h m n 36 yielding h m n 2 2 1 37 which implies the result of the theorem 24 remark for lti systems the connection between robust stabilization under coprime factor uncertainty and the matrix valued corona problem has been pointed out in 26 it amounts to finding a left inverse of m n with the norm bounded above by 1 r robust stabilization for ltv systems involves an operator corona problem 3 the latter may be stated in our case as follows we seek causal bounded linear operators u v bc 2 2 such that 14 v u m n vm un i 38 a necessary and sufficient condition is given by the following theorem theorem 4 the following statements are equivalent i there exist operators u v bc 2 2 such that vm un i and u v 1 r 39 ii sup n f 2 pnf 2 pnmf pnnf 2 1 r 40 proof the theorem follows from theorem 4 in 35 if the hankel operator is compact then its induced norm is equal to its maximal singular value and in fact its norm is achieved by some operator xo a 2 xo 2 1 i e sup x 2 1 x 2 xo 2 xo 2 41 a necessary and sufficient condition for any hankel operatorhx to be compact is that x belongs to a triangular algebra a plus the space of compact operator denoted k that is x a k 18 in our case if we define k as the space of compact operator from a 2 into c 2 and a b a 2 a 2 a 2 then is compact if and only if n m a k as in the lti case 26 this has implications for the operators and in particular attains its norm this is summarized in the following theorem theorem 5 let 0 1 then the following are equivalent 1 is a singular value of 2 there exists x 6 0 a 2 y 6 0 a 2 2 w 1 a 2 a 2 such that 15 n m x 1 2 1 2 w y n m y x 42 3 1 2 1 2 is a singular value of 4 there exists x 6 0 a 2 y 6 0 a 2 2 w 1 a 2 a 2 such that n m w 1 2 1 2 x 43 n m x y 1 2 1 2 w 44 5 1 2 1 2 is a singular value of proof follows as in the lti case 26 and is omitted in other words theorem 5 says that x and y are the schmidt pairs for the operator i e x y y x 45 similarly w 1 2 1 2 x x 1 2 1 2 w 46 and therefore x 1 2 1 2 w w 1 2 1 2 x 47 the last expression will be used to give an explicit formula for the optimal solution in this section we show that the optimal qo in 13 exists and that the infimum is indeed achieved to do so we invoke duality theory 20 we need first to introduce the class of compact operators on 2 called the trace class of operators acting from 2 into 2 2 denoted c 1 2 2 2 under the trace class norm 12 3 the following result gives a necessary and sufficient condition for to be a singular value of and generalizes its lti counterpart theorem 6 let 0 1 then is a singular value of if and only if there exists w 6 0 a 2 a 2 such that z n m n m w 1 2 1 2 w a 2 2 48 16 moreover if 48 holds then w 1 a 2 a 2 and theorem 5 3 and 4 hold for x 1 1 2 1 2 n m w y 1 1 2 1 2 z 49 the optimal operator qo bc 2 2 which achieves the infimum in 13 satisfies u v m n qo inf q bc 2 2 u v m n q and can be computed from the identities xo wo wo xo 50 that is xo andwo is the schmidt pair corresponding to the maximum singular value and satisfies theorems 5 and 6 and the following operator identity gives qo u v xo m n qoxo xo wo 51 qoxo m u n v xo m n wo 52 which solution is guaranteed to exist 4 conclusion in this paper we considered the problem of robust stabilization of ltv systems in the gap metric and its connection with coprime factor uncertainty we studied the problem of computing the optimal controller and characterize the radius of the maximal tv gap ball about the plant which can be stabilized by a fixed controller an operator corona theorem which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a robustly stabilizing controller was pointed out we introduced tv hankel and some related operators along with their singular values and vectors that play a central role in optimizing the tv gap and in the computation of the robust stabilizing controller the maximal stability margin under coprime factor uncertainty for ltv systems 17 is characterized as the norm of these operators our results generalize similar results obtained for the case of lti systems in 26 and in fact reduce to them in that case references 1 g zames and a k el sakkary unstable systems and feedback the gap metric in proc of the allerton conference pp 380 385 1980 2
