380 nominate new set of objectives for alternative views hypotheses experimental design and measurements in line with these principal objectives contemporary complex systems modelling machine learning and data mining research fundamentally often focus on model based exploitation of time series measurements for instantaneous system identification and intelligent causal inference here we introduce a new form of ode based discretization theory apply knowledge of this to develop a new algorithm called trm 1 2 3 4 5 6 and demonstrate an application of trm causal inference on test networks 2 and a real biological system using quantitative time series data of key kinases of the ddr pathway 6 nomenclature ode ordinary differential equations trm transposive regression causal inference method ddr dna damage response 1 1 new model theory and discretization of continuous data in mathematical modelling the concept of discretization applies to the partitioning of continuous data to acceptable smaller segments in intervals that can be used to represent the whole unpartioned continuous data often carried out without loss of dynamic features here we reason that a good data discretization research should also aim at successful optimal recovery of original continuous data from discretized data in 3 we evidenced successful complete recovery from artificial data discretized at small regular intervals under limited data condition i e the total number of measured time points states equal to number of dependent measurable variables the proposed discretization technique is based on a newly invented ordinary differential equations ode theory formulated by the author 2 4 5 6 the proposed inference algorithm is discussed here in more detail with an illustrated analysis of presented here to show how the inference was performed 1 2 the interplay between interaction matrix interaction network and mathematical model complex systems may be represented or aided by the use of network of interaction and network diagrams this could be in the form of a graphical network model interaction matrix network of nodes in 2 d real physical network structure or any other appropriate depiction for communicating and supporting plausible or functional causal explanation for example in systems biology interaction networks are used to describe biological phenomena and communication in genetic and biochemical networks 7 8 further explain analysis results from clinical or bio molecular data 9 and convey key concepts in personalized medicine 10 such representations may be linked to well formulated process based models that have captured and incorporated existing experts knowledge extracted from the literature to understand the interplay between an interaction matrix interaction network and model the study of complex networks and use of network paradigm may be employed seeking appropriate forms of network based approach to describe dynamic systems where the nodes in the network represent the measurable variables and the edges represent interactions between any pair of nodes crucially interactions may have weighted edges where the weights relate to the strength of the interactions 7 for example gene networks are commonly represented by directed graphs where the nodes of the graph are genes and the directed edges are causal relationships between genes 7 for example in metabolic pathway modelling it is important to formulate appropriate functions that describe the behaviour of the constituents of the system by identifying key components of interest with their symbolic names using directional arrows showing which components modulate the flows into between and out of components 8 in such cases the set of nodes is defined by the dependent variables importantly the edges and their weights and so the network topology must be inferred from the available data a major challenge confronting contemporary complex systems modelling is the problem of finding efficient and appropriate model construction methods to use there is a necessary requirement to develop new fast network inference techniques that may instantaneously solve parameter estimation tasks and construct network of interaction 375 michael a idowu procedia computer science 61 2015 373 380 purely from discretized time series data in this regard we propose a deterministic approach that is founded on matrix based differential equations the proposed method seeks to tackle system identification and parameter estimation challenges by adopting a matrix based method of solving systems of linear or alternatively log linear differential equations 1 3 systems of ordinary differential equations conventional models that are based on ode are regularly used to describe complex processes of a complex system 11 the simplest form of ode based model is the deterministic system of linear differential equations e g figure 1 fig 1 example of a simple ode based model alternatively further interpretation and analysis of such simple models are easy to reformulated particularly if intrinsically associated with matrix based forms e g the model in fig 1 may be reformulated fig 2 fig 2 example of a reconfigured matrix based ode model with heatmap such a system is then described to above to be of linear differential equations with 8 dependent variables and an associated jacobian transformation matrix a with the kinetic parameters fig 3 example of a simple ode model 376 michael a idowu procedia computer science 61 2015 373 380 furthermore the transformation matrix a could be viewed as a representation of captures influxes and effluxes within and out of the interrelated components for instance the matrix a may be interpreted as illustrating complex interactions between the components modes or dependent variables each exerting positive and or negative influences on other components of the network fig 4 fig 4 a transformation matrix as a mechanism of capturing and representing interactions influxes and effluxes within an interaction network in general prime models such as the above mentioned may be employed to capture and represent systems of nonlinear equations whose general solution is equivalent to the system of linear or log linear differential equations fig 5 fig 5 a model of linear differential equations upper model and an equivalent system of nonlinear equations based on eigenvalues and eigenvectors lower image 2 the latter i e nonlinear representation adopts a formulation that may be based on eigenvalues and parameters or other forms of parameters and variables that must be consistent with the initial condition e g linear combination of the eigenvectors etc as partially evidenced in 2 the author here concludes the implied solution must also be consistent with the eigen based model fig 6 below fig 6 a proposed eigen based model which is consistent with the initial condition ic involving a decomposition of ic into linear combinations of eigenvectors 377 michael a idowu procedia computer science 61 2015 373 380 2 inverse problems as reverse engineering challenges assume that some evolutionary dynamics of a target complex system may be captured and recorded by measuring the amount concentrations or levels of key dependent interacting components over a sufficient time period or certain regular time intervals the unknown transformation matrix that defines the system characteristics or behavior i e that have not been predetermined must be inferred from the historical data in an efficient and consistent fashion ultimately the associated inverse problem must be completely solved to optimally identify the relevant and valid kinetics approximated interactions and processes that have occurred in such scenarios where little or no information is supplied about the topology of the interaction network prime models may be used to capture the unknown systems dynamics the solution found may not be entirely unique depending on the amount of data given but it should adequate capture the observable features exhibited in the data however fast methods capable of producing plausible solutions are required must be developed and engaged for improved efficiency there must be a devised non iterative technique that can adequately guarantee a solution would be found under limited data condition and identify the unique solution in optimum time requirement and unlimited data conditions 2 we assume a unique solution may exist if the data size i e the total number of time points measured exceeds the number of dependent variables 2 1 inverse problems systems of nonlinear equations essentially an inverse problem that is based on time series data may be formulated as a reverse engineering problem of finding a consistent matrix exponential from a system of nonlinear equations figure 7 fig 7 an elementary perspective on inverse problem definition of seeking to find optimal matrix exponential finding a matrix exponential is usually a difficult task solving such without making a priori assumptions about the structure of the interaction network is much more challenging the algorithm prescribed below introduces an efficient algorithm for solving inverse problems in seconds the xbefore and xafter vectors defined and introduced above represent the system states i e array of vectors before and after any transformations within the stated period respectively 378 michael a idowu procedia computer science 61 2015 373 380 2 2 a fast and efficient solution to inverse problems given an inverse problem where both the matrix exponential and transformation matrix must be found the following algorithm may be used to find an appropriate solution the transposive regression trm method 2 6 invented by the author is presented in fig 8 fig 8 an invented trm method for tackling system identification and parameter estimation challenges using an appropriate discretization theory the derived transformation matrix must be assessed to verify that the actual historical data could be simulated our expectation is that a proposed inference method of strategy must first be simulating the original data that is supplied this fundamental requirement should be satisfied and assessed in model construction before further simulation is performed or prediction made from the constructed model for improved trust reliability and evidencing performance any comparison made between the actual data and simulated data should minimize discrepancies during the assessment tests on solution methods 3 application of the proposed trm method 3 1 dynamic modelling of biological systems consider an application of the proposed reverse engineering method to dna damage response ddr pathway modelling a sample quantitative time series data of key kinases of the ddr pathway treated with an anti cancer chemotherapy drug doxorubicin is measured and recorded at almost regular time intervals fig 9 left image fig 9 a a sample time series data left associated with the dna damage response pathway b the inferred jacobian transformation matrix right consistent with the historical data 6 the trm inference method used to derive the transformation matrix ensures that the jacobian based model is consistent with the historical data as demonstrated in fig 10 a the above data set typifies a limited data condition the number of time points is quite small for effective dynamic modelling the difficulty of the reverse engineering is even greater when the whole inference process must be purely based on the supplied data i e in the absence of any additional constraints the trm method is then applied 379 michael a idowu procedia computer science 61 2015 373 380 on the dataset measured at regular time intervals here in our case this requires eliminating the 2 hr state vector only before analyzing the entire data the transformation matrix fig 9 right image is first derived using the trm algorithm and should be verified to ensure that it is capable of reproducing the historical data utilized prior to simulating other missing unmeasured uncaptured and unrecorded data within the recorded time periods at the unknown interpolated time steps the constructed model is then used to populate the actual dataset to produce a more continuous far much richer quantity fig 10 a an application of the trm produces a non discrepant comparison left image between actual discretized experimental data and predicted simulated and interpolated data ensuring data consistency b derived in silico topological map representing

system through continuous simulation unknown dynamics are instantaneously generated to reconfirm the model outputs verifying and ensuring little or no discrepancy between the actual and simulated predicted data as illustrated in fig 10 left image on successful identification of models that are consistent with data a further system analysis of the optimal model would be required to further

systems may be profiled by measuring system properties over time one way of capturing and representing such complex processes phenomena is through an ode model of the associated measured time series data a novel computational method for reconstructing data consistent ode models in seconds has been invented by the author the proposed technique could be used either as a purely data driven modelling strategy or complementary approach to other existing process based modelling methods as demonstrated here difficult challenges of instantaneous system identification or automated parameter estimation may be adequately tackled using the trm algorithm in underdetermined conditions the solution produced might not be unique however the method always seeks a data consistent solution and avoid other candidate solutions that may not be plausible through the proposed discretization theory in essence our method demands utilization and reproducibility of original and additional historical data to improve intelligence and performance sample time series data are highly useful for instantaneous systems modelling identification and improved design of optimization algorithms inference methods and
