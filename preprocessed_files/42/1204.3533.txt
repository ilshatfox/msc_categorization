the sum of a series indexed by a set on which a group operates we prove that the sum of the series that defines the riemann zeta function the epstein zeta function and a few other series indexed by zk has an intrinsic meaning as a complex number independent of the requirements of analytic continuation the definition of the sum requires nothing more than algebra and the concept of absolute convergence the analytical significance of the algebraically defined sum is then explained by an argument that relies on the poisson formula for tempered distributions 1 introduction we introduce two notions of summability of infinite series t summability t stands for translation and h summability h stands for homothety with h summability being more general the definition of t summability is given in 1 1 in 1 2 we motivate h summability with an example the complete definition of h summability is given in 2 3 the very first sentence of 1 2 presents a problem in analysis which is circumvented by the algebraic definition of h summability theorem 1 2 stated in 1 3 resolves the analytic problem theorem 6 6 from which theorem 1 2 is deduced is the main result of the paper the poisson formula plays a central role in this development the intrinsic meaning of an infinite sum is our primary goal not analytic con tinuation nevertheless the naturality of the summability definitions yields some applications to analytic continuation when the terms of the series are functions of a complex variable a few such statements of analytic continuation have been listed in 1 4 the resulting meromorphic functions do not possess a functional equation in general the last subsection 1 5 of the introduction lays out the plan of the paper 1 1 t summability we begin with the definition of t summability of a series in dexed by a commutative discrete group given a function a c we want to define a c in a translation invariant manner precisely we require axioms i and ii to hold axiom i the collection of a c for which a is defined is a complex linear subspace of c and a 7 a is a complex linear functional defined on that subspace 1 http arxiv org abs 1204 3533 v 3 2 madhav v nori for define a c by a a for all axiom ii 1 if a is defined then a is defined and equals a in the presence of axiom i one checks that axiom ii implies the identity 1 c a c a for every finitely supported c c where c a denotes the convolution of c with a now the above formula is valid when the series a is absolutely convergent we are thus led to the following definition the series a is translation summable or simply t summable or t convergent if there is a finitely supported c c so that 0 6 c and the series c a is absolutely convergent the sum of the series is then defined by the formula below 2 a c 1 c a the commutativity hypothesis is crucial the commutativity of ensures the validity of statements a and b that follow a the left hand side of equation 2 is independent of the choice of c b the space of t summable functions a c and the map a 7 a satisfy axioms i and ii in particular if the series a is t summable then the series c a is also t summable for every finitely supported function c c and equation 1 holds the basic example of a t summable series for zk that we are concerned with follows let t z c z 1 for n n 1 nk zk and z z 1 zk tk we put zn zn 11 zn 22 z nk k given a subset m zk and a m c we define a zk c by a n a n if n m and a n 0 if n m when n zk a n is t summable we will simply say that n m a n is t summable a function f rk r 0 c is homogeneous of type s c 1 if 3 f tx tsf x and f x f x for all t 0 0 6 x rk the theorem that follows is easy it has been stated because the function ff x z that emerges especially its behavior for x in a neighborhood of zero and z z 1 z 2 zk in a neighborhood of 1 1 1 tk is the focus of a good part of the paper specifically in sections 1 2 1 3 5 and 6 the remarks following the statement of the theorem explain the situation theorem 1 1 let f rk r 0 c be a c function homogeneous of type s then the series 4 ff x z 06 n zk f x n zn is t summable x d z tk r 1 1 1 1 condition c in 1 3 of hardy s book divergent series can be thought of axiom ii for z and 1 hardy s a and b are axiom i summation and the poisson formula 3 where d rk r zk r 0 rk r zk 0 furthermore the sum of this series gives a c function on the domain d tk r 1 where 1 tk is the multiplicative identity 1 1 1 of the group tk the first assertion of the theorem is that the series ff x z is t summable this is implied by the absolute convergence of the series gi n x z 1 zi nff x z whenever n 0 once this has been checked t summability defines ff x z 1 zi ngi n x z under the assumption that zi 6 1 this procedure therefore defines ff x z when z z 1 zk tk is different from 1 1 1 the absolute convergence of gi n x z relies only on the fundamental theorem of calculus and the finiteness of the integral rk 1 x k 1 that the sum is c uses a little more from a first course in analysis see corollary 3 9 consider the special case k 1 and f x x s whenever x is a nonzero real number the theorem defines n 1 x n szn n 1 x n sz n as a c function on the domain x z r t x 1 and z 6 1 this is true for every s c consider next z 1 the series f x 1 is t summable if and only if it is absolutely convergent in particular its sum is not defined for re s 1 by t summability for s 6 1 an algebraic definition of ff 0 1 is given in 1 2 1 2 h summability with f and ff as in theorem 1 1 it would be natural to obtain the value of 06 n zk f n by evaluating the limit lim z 1 ff 0 z but this limit does not exist in general however this problem can be resolved algebraically in the following manner let m 1 be a natural number let tk m z tk zm 1 with f ff as is in 4 we have the identity tk m ff 0 z m k sff 0 z m z tk with zm 6 1 we rewrite the above as ff 0 z mk sff 0 zm 16 tk m ff 0 z the term on the right is defined for all z in a neighborhood of 1 tk this suggests that the value of ff 0 1 can be forced by setting z 1 in the above formula when s 6 k by choosing m n so that ms k 6 1 5 06 n zk f n 1 mk s 1 16 tk m ff 0 the term on the right in equation 5 is checked be independent of the choice of m the procedure above leads to the definition of h summability or h convergence of a series it is in fact an iteration of the method that defines t summability the precise definition is given in 2 3 the series 06 n zk f n is h summable when s 6 k 1 and its sum is given by 5 when s 6 k when 1 the sum of the series is zero 4 madhav v nori 1 3 the poisson formula we continue with the f and ff of theorem 1 1 the relation between the sum of the h summable series 06 n zk f n and the behaviour of ff 0 z as z t approaches 1 is given in corollary 1 3 this is obtained from thm 1 2 which in turn is deduced from theorem 6 6 the main result of this paper we set up the notation for fourier transforms and the poisson formula 6 x y exp 2 1 x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 xkyk for x x 1 xk y y 1 yk rk we have the fourier transform 7 h y rk h x x y dx 1 dx 2 dxk for h l 1 rk the poisson formula asserts 8 n zkh n n zk h n under certain integrability and regularity assumptions on h see for instance 2 chapter vii of weil s book 20 subtracting h 0 h 0 from both sides we get a modified form of the poisson formula 2 9 h 0 n zkr 0 h n h 0 n zkr 0 h n that is valid for a wider class of h we return now to our c function f rk r 0 c which is homogeneous of type s it is well known that f extends uniquely as a homogeneous tempered distribution see 8 vol 1 chapter 7 as long as 10 s e k 1 e e 0 1 2 its fourier transform f is then c on 0 6 y rk and is homogeneous of type k s the assumption 10 is equivalent to the assertion that there are no distributions supported at the origin with the same homogeneity degree the fourier transform of distributions supported at the origin are polynomials theorem 1 2 requires that we exclude the homogeneity degree of polynomials and their fourier transforms we will write 11 ek r k tk for x 1 xk 7 exp 2 1 x 1 exp 2 1 xk theorem 1 1 defines the function ff x z as the sum of a t summable series for all 1 6 z tk and all x d where d rk r zk r 0 thus ff x eky is defined for all y rk r zk d r 0 we therefore have the function 12 x y f y ff x eky defined when x y d d r 0 and the same consideration applied to f yields 13 f x x y f f y ekx defined when x y d r 0 d 2 j f burnol s paper 4 has this form of the poisson formula on p 798 on p 799 he refers to the work of a connes 6 and that of muntz explained by titchmarsh in 2 11 19 summation and the poisson formula 5 the poisson formula as presented in equation 9 when applied to the function h given by h w f w x w y yields the equality of the functions defined in 12 and 13 on the region d r 0 d r 0 however the absence of absolute convergence and the singularity at 0 rk of f or f or both presents a problem that has to be overcome this statement for r rather than rk is essentially the functional equation of the lerch zeta function see equations 1 4 page 161 and 2 4 page 163 of apostol s paper 2 the desired equality now on rk extends the domain of the functions given in 12 and 13 to d d r 0 0 part 1 of the theorem below goes further and extends the domain to d d theorem 1 2 let f rk r 0 c be c and homogeneous of type s as sume that both s and k s satisfy 10 then there is a c function f reg f d d c with the following properties 1 f reg f agrees with the functions given in 12 and 13 on their respective do mains 2 f reg f 0 0 equals 06 n zk f n as defined by equation 5 3 06 n zk f n 06 n zk f n part 3 follows from interchanging the roles of f and f when k 1 part 3 is simply the functional equation of the riemann zeta function part 1 of the theorem applied to the function in 12 with x 0 combines with part 2 of the theorem to give corollary 1 3 y 7 ff 0 eky f y defined for 0 6 y d extends to a c function on d whose value at zero is given by 06 n zk f n we think of the above corollary as the analytic significance of the algebraically defined sum the environment of theorem 1 2 for k 1 has been subjected to extensive study our functions ff x exp 2 1 y are closely related to the lerch zeta function y x s n 0 x n s exp 2 1 ny whose properties have been investigated in recent times by j lagarias and w li the reader can gather its history from their paper 12 the functional equation of the lerch zeta function was proved by lerch in 1887 another proof of this theorem is given by apostol 2 where he follows riemann s method as is well known this method begins by expressing 0 as 1 0 1 then converts 1 0 to 1 by a change of variables and proceeds we do not follow this method and rely instead on conven tional methods in distributions namely the use of cut off functions a proof of the functional equation of the zeta function that also relies on distributions similar but not identical to ours is due to s miller and w schmid in a paper 15 that has far wider goals and applications the paper 7 of p gerardin and w li interprets the functional equation of the zeta function as an equality of tempered distributions the recent paper 3 by burnol also studies the poisson formula for tempered distributions 6 madhav v nori 1 4 analytic continuation the complex number s that has appeared so far has been a constant in this subsection s is a variable sums of t summable and h summable series turn out to be meromorphic functions of s when the terms of the series are holomorphic functions of s we give some instances example t 1 let f rk r 0 0 be a c function such that f tx tf x for all t 0 and for all x rk r 0 then the series n zk znf n s is t summable for all 1 6 z tk and all s c the sum of the series is c in z and holomorphic in s this is proved in corollary 3 10 example t 1 contains the two ancient examples of analytic continuation stated be low example t 2 the series n 1 z nn s is t summable for all 1 6 z t and for all s c the sum of the series is c in z and holomorphic in s in particular the familiar series n 1 1 nn s is t summable for all s c and its sum is holomorphic in s our t summability method here is no different from the finite difference method employed by j sondow see 16 to give an elementary proof of this well known statement example t 3 the dirichlet s l series l s n 1 n n s is t summable for ev ery nontrivial dirichlet character and its sum is an entire function of s this is deduced from linear combinations of example t 1 the series that defines the riemann zeta function however is t summable if and only if is absolutely summable nevertheless it is h summable when s 6 1 example h 1 with f as in example t 1 the series n zk f n s is h summable for all k 6 s c the sum of this series gives a holomorphic function on the region k 6 s c at s k this function has a simple pole or is holomorphic this statement is contained in proposition 4 6 taking f q where q is a positive definite quadratic form we obtain the analyticity of the epstein zeta function but unlike the situation for the epstein zeta function there is no functional equation in general the fourier transform of f s is not gs k times a function of s thus the proof for example h 1 is structurally different from the classical proof of the analytic continuation of the epstein zeta function which relies on the poisson formula homogeneity in example h 1 can be replaced by suitable bounds on partial deriva tives the example below illustrates this point we first set up the required notation let p p 0 p 1 pd where the pi are homogeneous polynomials of degree i on rk assume that pd x 0 for all 0 6 x rk we then have a finite subset f zk such that p n 0 for all n zk n f we denote by the sum taken over zk r f example h 2 with assumptions and notation as stated the the series p n s is h summable for all s c s e where e k j d j 2 z j 0 the sum of this series denoted by g s is holomorphic on c e and has simple poles at worst on e for k odd and for an integer s 0 the finite sum n f p n s equals g s example h 2 is contained in theorem 4 7 the last assertion gives a generalization of the values of the riemann zeta function at 0 2 4 summation and the poisson formula 7 1 5 the plan of the paper is as follows the next section has the definitions of t summability and h summability sections 3 and 4 are concerned with t summable series and h summable series respectively sufficient conditions for testing summa bility are given it is also shown the sum of a series is well behaved with respect to parameters theorem 1 1 and the analytic continuation results mentioned in 1 4 are proved in these sections section 5 is essentially a review of the poisson formula for distributions based on ideas borrowed from 21 13 and 14 followed by some simple analysis of the singularities this discussion is applied to a class of distributions h rk defined in section 6 the main result there and of the paper is theorem 6 6 which is valid for a considerably wider class of functions than those that appear in theorem 1 2 homogeneity is not required every extension of f as a distribution on rk forces a definition of n zk f n this section closes with a definition of t integrability of distributions 3 on rk the last section discusses the more general definition of the sum of a series indexed by a setx which a groupg acts theh summability definition of 7 is more stringent than h summability it has the advantage of getting rid of the anomalous behaviour of h summability in part 2 of theorem 4 7 and example 2 5 the disadvantage of h summability is that the series that defines the riemann zeta function is not h summable for s 1 3 5 whereas this series is h summable for all s 6 1 a word of apology regarding notation the euclidean space figuring in sections 3 and 4 is invariably rk sections 5 and 6 have finite dimensional real vector spaces x and x and the k s of those sections are variable non negative integers finally in sections 2 and 7 x denotes a set equipped with the action of a group g 2 definition of t summability and h summability 2 1 the canonical extension given a a commutative ring a a field k and a ring homomorphism a k where k is a field b an inclusion m n of left a modules and c a left a module homomorphism i m k and we define its canonical extension ic mc k as follows let s a a a 6 0 this is a multiplicative subset of a we obtain s 1 i s 1 m k let i n s 1 n denote the homomorphism n 7 n 1 for all n n note that s 1 m is contained in s 1 n we define mc by 14 mc n n i n s 1 m n n s s so that sn m now i n s 1 n restricts to j mc s 1 m denoting by ic the composite 15 mc j s 1 m s 1 i k we obtain ic mc k with the property i ic m then ic mc k will be referred to as the canonical extension of the a module homomorphism i m k 3 akshay venkatesh points out that kudla and rallis have more sophisticated versions and appli cations of translation invariance in 10 8 madhav v nori 2 2 t summability the canonical extension is now applied to the following situation a a c the group algebra of a discrete abelian group the field k equals c and the augmentation a k takes c a to c b m l 1 the collection f c satisfying f n c is the space of allc valued functions on the collection of finitely supported f n is a therefore we have a m n the convolution f 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 1 is defined when f 1 a and f 2 n this gives n the structure of a a module if f 1 f 2 m then f 1 f 2 is defined and belongs to m this gives m the structure of a c algebra and a is then a c subalgebra of m in particular m is a a submodule of n c i m c is given by i f f now i is a ring homomorphism and i a it follows that i is a a module homomorphism the enlarged domain mc will be denoted by lt the canonical extension ic will be denoted by t lt c the notation t denoting t summation a function f c is t summable if and only if f belongs to lt let f lt let and consider the translate f of f given by f f then f also belongs to lt and tf tf this definition of t summability is no different from the one given in the introduc tion it is important that is an abelian group lemma 2 1 let 1 be a subgroup of an abelian group 2 given a function a 1 c we extend it by zero to obtain a 2 c then a is t summable if and only if a is t summable proof the if part is straight from the definition to see the converse assume that a is t summable we have s c 2 with s 6 0 such that the convolution s a belongs to l 1 2 both properties of s are preserved when s is replaced by a translate of s thus we may assume that s 1 is nonzero the restriction of s a to 1 is s 1 a the latter is therefore absolutely summable it follows that a is t summable 2 3 h summability here r is a commutative ring and is a r module in order to set up the data for the canonical extension we observe first that r the group of units of r operates on and therefore on the space of functions c as well it is a simple consequence of the definition of t summability that i lt c is a r submodule and ii t is a r invariant functional we now have a a c r k c and a c is the augmentation of the group algebra b m lt and n c c i m c is given by t lt c the canonical extension ic mc c associated to the data specified will be denoted by h lh c a function f c is said to be h summable if and only if f lh we summarise the properties of the above construction in the proposition below summation and the poisson formula 9 proposition 2 2 let be a r module where r is a commutative ring then a the spaces l 1 lt lh c are all stable under the natural action of r b h lh c is a r invariant linear functional c the space lt is stable under translation by the restriction of h to lt is a invariant linear functional in part c of the proposition the restriction of h to lt is of course t 2 4 instability of h summability example 2 3 the space of h summable functions on need not be stable under translations by to see this let r be a subring of c claim 1 f x x for all x is h summable proof because 1 a f ax f x 0 for all a r we see that s f 0 where s 1 a a 1 c r now s 1 a 1 is nonzero if a 6 1 taking a 1 we see that f is h summable claim 2 the constant function v x 1 for all x is not h summable proof if v is h summable there is some s c r with s 6 0 such that s v is t summable this in turn implies that there is some s c with s 6 0 such that s s v is absolutely summable but s s v is the nonzero constant function s s and so we get a contradiction the claims combine to show that f is h summable but its translate f x 1 f x v x is not h summable remark 2 4 now let 2 be a r 2 submodule let r 1 be a subring of r 2 and let 1 be a r 1 submodule of 2 let a 2 c denote the extension by zero of a 1 c the h stability of a does not imply the h stability of a take for example r 1 1 z and r 2 2 q and let a be the constant function 1 on z it has been remarked in example 2 3 that a is not h summable but it will be seen later in proposition 4 5 that a is h summable and also that ha 0 the fact that the space of h summable functions grows when 1 r 1 is replaced by 2 r 2 is to our advantage because it defines the sum of more series in a canonical manner the example below shows however that this sum has to be treated with caution example 2 5 we observe here that even when the translates of a h summable f are h summable the sum is not translation invariant take r q consider the function f q c which takes the value 1 on the set of natural numbers and is zero elsewhere by prop 4 5 we see that f x f x is h summable and its sum is 1 because s 1 1 c q satisfies s 2 we deduce that f is h summable and h f 1 2 now g x f x 1 is h summable because f g has finite support but h f f g h g 1 h g thus hf x 1 hf x 1 2 5 an inductive definition we apply the canonical extension repeatedly to the following situation which contains the earlier summability definitions let g be a group equipped with commutative subgroups h 1 h 2 hn with the property that hj is contained in the normaliser of hi whenever 1 i j n it follows that 10 madhav v nori i gk hkhk 1 hn is a subgroup of g and ii hk gk for all k 1 2 n next let n be a left c g module let m n be a c g submodule and let i 0 m c be a g invariant linear functional we define inductively a m m 0 m 1 mn n such that mk is a representation of gk b a gk invariant linear functional ik mk c such that the restriction of ik to mk 1 is ik 1 for all 1 k n let g 0 g assume that the gk submodule mk n and the gk invariant linear functional ik mk c have been defined for some 0 k n we re gard mk n as hk representations and ik as a hk invariant linear functional be cause hk is commutative the canonical extension of ik is defined and denoted by ik 1 mk 1 c because hk is normal in gk it follows that mk 1 is gk stable and ik 1 is gk invariant the pair mk 1 ik 1 enjoys the same properties when gk is replaced by a subgroup of gk taking the subgroup to be gk 1 completes the induction note that mn is a hn representation and in mn c is hn invariant in practise n l 1 x and m cx and i 0 x here x is a set on which g operates h summability is contained in the case n 2 3 t summability a commutative discrete group remains fixed throughout this section the ring structure of the group algebra c is given by convolution for d c we will denote the n th power of d in this ring namely d d d n times by d n t z c z 1 hom t is the pontrjagin dual of a commu tative group given functions a b c pointwise multiplication gives a b c and convolution when defined gives another function a b c given a c we shall frequently say that the series a is t summable or simply that a is t summable when a lt the sum of the series denoted by ta in the previous section will now be referred to simply as a the lemma below demonstrates that t summability behaves well lemma 3 1 let a c be a function and let 0 assume that the series a 0 is t summable then the series a is t summable for all in some neighborhood u of 0 in furthermore 7 a gives a continuous function on u proof the t summability of a 0 says there is some c c thus c is a function on with finite support so that i c 6 0 and ii b c a 0 l 1 let h c and g b for all both g and h are continuous functions on let v be the open subset of given by h 6 0 by assumption i above 1 v now convolution commutes with pointwise multiplication by a character from this we see that a 0 is t summable when v and also that a 0 g h for all v summation and the poisson formula 11 3 1 sufficient conditions for t summability recall that the n th power of d in the group algebra c is denoted by d n lemma 3 2 let c i ki 1 1 i 1 1 i c assume that 1 2 k are generators of let a c be a function for the statements below 1 2 3 1 there is a natural number n so that 1 i n a l 1 for all i 1 k 2 there is a natural number n so that c n a l 1 3 a is t summable for all 1 6 proof we see that c n is in the ideal generated by 1 i 2 n i 1 2 k and this proves the first implication we note next that h c is the sum of 1 i 2 taken over i 1 2 k and thus h 0 if 6 1 it follows that c n h n 0 for such because c n a c n a we conclude the t summability of a when 6 1 lemmas 3 3 and 3 4 will be appealed to in the next section on h summability they are irrelevant for the rest of this section lemma 3 3 assume that a c satisfies condition 1 of lemma 3 2 let n n and let p n denote the projection let b n c be a function satisfying n b 0 1 then the series b p a is t summable let wi 1 i n 1 i and let w w n 1 w n k 2 then w nnk 0 and w b p a is in l 1 proof the hypothesis n b 0 implies that b is a linear combination of nontrivial characters of n thus 1 follows from the previous lemma it suffices to prove part 2 of the lemma for b with as above now 1 of lemma 3 2 implies that 1 p i i n a p is in l 1 part 2 is proved once it is checked that w is in the ideal in the group algebra of generated by 1 p i i n for i 1 2 k choose i so that p i 6 1 now wi is a multiple of 1 p i i it follows that both w n i and w are multiples of 1 p i i n this completes the proof of part 2 lemma 3 4 with the assumptions of lemma 3 2 assume there is some natural number n so that 1 i n a 0 for all i 1 2 k then a is t summable for all 1 6 hom c and in fact a 0 proof this follows from 0 1 i n a 1 i i n a and 1 i i n 1 i n noting that 1 6 i for some i once it assumed that 6 1 3 2 t summability with parameters it will be necessary to state everything with parameters our parameter space is a topological space w the domain of several functions considered is the space w which inherits its product topology frequently w is an open subset of euclidean space 12 madhav v nori we collect in lemma 3 5 below some basic properties easily derived from a first course in analysis such as 1 17 we set up the requisite notation first given a c and a finite subset s we set a s 1 a s given a function a w c we put aw a w for all w w and define a s 1 sup aw s 1 w w a w c is acceptable if inf a s 1 s s 0 we assume that is discrete and w is a topological space and then w is endowed with its product topology lemma 3 5 assume that a w c is acceptable for w w and let ga w be the sum of the absolutely convergent series aw 1 if a is continuous then ga w c is also continuous 2 if w c is open and w 7 a w is holomorphic for every then w 7 ga w is holomorphic for every 3 if w rm is open if v rm and if the directional derivative va of w 7 a w exists is acceptable and continuous then the directional derivative vga of the function w 7 ga w exists for all w w and is in fact given by vga gb where b va part 1 of the lemma is the weierstrass m test rephrased to suit the situation at hand part 2 of the lemma is the basis of analytic continuation in the parameters 3 3 t summability for zk for the rest of this section we take zk and tk the given basis of zk namely 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 will be denoted e 1 e 2 ek given a z k c we put ia 1 ei a thus ia n a n a n ei for all n zk iterating this operator m times we have 1 ei m a mi a we wish to find sufficient conditions that ensure mi a l 1 zk for all 1 i k in order to appeal to lemma 3 2 we do so when a f zk and f rk c is a c function we use the same notation i for functions on rk as well expressing if as the integral of if and iterating this procedure we get mi f x 1 0 1 0 mi f x t 1 t 2 tm ei dt 1 dt 2 dtm which gives 16 mi f x sup mi f x tei 0 t m for the rest of this section for g rk c we set 17 g sup 1 x k 1 g x x rk x 2 x x is the standard euclidean norm on rk we obtain a constant c m k 18 n zk sup g n y y rk y m c m k g putting all the above together we see 19 n zk mi f n c m k mi f so to apply lemma 3 2 all we require is the finiteness of mi f for all 1 i k and for some m with as given in 17 a convenient class of functions which satisfies this condition is given below summation and the poisson formula 13 definition 3 6 a c valued c function f defined on the complement of a compact k rk is h if there is some p r for which 20 x r rvf x is o x p as x v rk r 0 where v denotes the directional derivative let f w rk rk c be a function so that fw is c for all w w where fw x f w x for all w w x rk we say f is uniformly h if there 21 sup x r p rvf w x w w x rk x k v rk r 0 for some p r and some compact subset k of rk that contains k note that if f rk c is c 20 is equivalent to 22 below 22 sup 1 x r p rvf x x rk v rk r 0 we are ready to state and prove the main result of this section the notation below stands for the sum taken over n zk n k precisely the n th term of the series is defined to be zero when n k zk and the resulting series whose terms are indexed by zk is tested for t summability theorem 3 7 a assume f rn rk c is h then the series n zn f n zn is t summable for all 1 6 z tk the sum of the series denoted by gf z is continuous on the domain 1 6 z tk b assume that f w rk r k c is uniformly h denote the sum of the t summable series n zk f w n zn by gf w z for all w w 1 6 z tk if f is continuous so is gf c with notation and assumptions as in b assume in addition that w c is open and moreover that w 7 f w x is holomorphic for every x rk r k then w 7 gf w z is a holomorphic function of w w for every 1 6 z tk proof we first prove all three parts of the theorem under the assumption that k is empty in a we therefore assume that f is defined on all of rk the estimate 22 is valid now with p as in that estimate we choose any m so that m p k 1 it follows that mi f for all 1 i k the bound 19 then shows that mi f zk l 1 zk for all 1 i k the 1 implies 3 of lemma 3 2 proves the t convergence of the given series by lemma 3 1 we see that the sum of this series is continuous for parts b and c we once again choose m in exactly the same manner but with p as in 21 we deduce that mi fw zk 1 w w 1 i k is bounded above by remark 3 5 we see that ui defined by ui w z n zk mi f w n z n for all w w z tk is a continuous function and holomorphic in w under the assumptions of c be cause 1 zi mgf w z ui w z for all 1 6 z tk and for all 1 i k we see that the function gf w z has the same property this completes the proof of the theorem when k is empty 14 madhav v nori we now come to the general case choose a test function c c rk satisfying k x rk x 1 and zk supp zk k given f as in b we note that h w x 1 x f w x if x k and h w x 0 if x k defines h on all of w rk furthermore if f satisfies the assumption of c so does h parts b and c have already been proved for h we note that n zk h w x zn n zk f w n zn this finishes the proof of b and c in general a is the special case of b when w is a point remark 3 8 the sum of the series in theorem 3 7 a is in fact c at 1 6 z tk this can be seen by noting that with m as in the above proof the same argument shows that m di pf zk l 1 zk for every polynomial of degree at most d we skip the details the statement is contained in lemma 6 5 theorem 1 1 as stated in the introduction is a special case of the corollary below corollary 3 9 assume f rk rk c is h let f zk be a finite subset and let d x rk k x f the series f x n zn n zk n f is t summable for all x d z tk z 6 1 the sum of this series is a c function on d tk r 1 proof the t summability assertion follows from part a of theorem 3 7 once it is noted that translates of h functions are also h applying part b of that theorem to the function x y 7 f x y on the domain w rk rk where w is a relatively compact subset of d the continuity in the second assertion follows part 3 of lemma 3 5 combined with the above remark corollary 3 10 assume f g rk r 0 c are both c and homogeneous of type 1 1 and s 0 respectively assume furthermore that f x is a positive real number for all 0 6 x rk then the t convergent sum n zk f x sg x zn is a holomorphic function of s c for all x rk and for all 1 6 z tk proof to apply theorem 3 7 c one has to observe that h s x f x sg x is uniformly h on w x rk x r where w is a bounded subset of c and r is any positive real number as remarked in the introduction this implies the analytic continuation of l s for nontrivial dirichlet characters the proofs of t summability given so far suggest a broader definition that of t integrability on rk this requires the language of distributions and is given in 6 10 summation and the poisson formula 15 4 h summability on qk remark 4 1 before beginning on h summability we inform the reader that the simple lemma 2 1 on t summability with 1 z k and 2 q k will be invoked several times in this section notation 4 2 recall that h summability has been defined for r modules where r is a commutative ring in this section r q and qk given a qk c and a subset m qk we have rma qk c given by rma x a x if x m and rma x 0 if x m for t q and a qk c we define t a x a t 1 x x qk we observe that 23 t rm t 1 f rtmf m qk t q f qk c given m qk and a m c we extend a by zero and obtain a qk c when n qk a n is h summable we will often say that n m a n is h summable or even more simply that a is h summable proposition 4 3 let f rk r 0 c be c and homogeneous of type s then 1 06 n zk f n is h summable if s 6 k 1 2 assume x zk then n zk f x n is h summable if s k i 1 i i 0 1 2 proof we define f 0 0 and regard rk as the domain of f n zk f n zn is t convergent for z 6 1 by corollary 3 9 summing over the nontrivial n torsion points of tk we deduce that nkrnzkf rzkf is t summable thanks to the homogeneity assumption and 23 we get 24 nk s n 1 rzkf is t summable on qk it follows that rzkf is h summable if n k s 1 6 0 and that its sum is given by 25 06 n zk f n nk s 1 1 06 n zk f n zn 1 6 z tk zn 1 if s 6 k one may choose such a natural number n if if 1 then 1 1 rzkf 0 so it is h summable in this case as well this proves part 1 fix x rk let fx v f x v for every v rk utilizing the taylor expansion of f at v rk we obtain f v x g 0 v g 1 v gm 1 v remm v when v x we note that gi v i xf v i is c on rk r 0 and homogeneous of type s i 1 i by part 1 we see that rzkgi is h convergent if m re s h k we see that remm v is o v h as v and so remm zk is in l 1 zk it follows that rzkfx being a finite sum of h convergent series is itself h convergent 16 madhav v nori lemma 4 4 if f rk r 0 c is c 1 homogeneous of type k 1 and if 06 n zk f n is h summable then f 0 proof we first assume that f is c we set f 0 0 recall the subspaces l 1 t q k l 1 h qk cq k v as in proposition 2 2 from 24 we see that n 1 rzkf l 1 t qk for every natural number n in addition we have 1 rzkf rzkf it follows that i the image of rzkf in v l 1 t q k is invariant under the action of q from i and the definition of h summability we get ii rzkf is h summable if and only if it is t summable by remark 4 1 with 1 z k and 2 q k we note iii rzkf is t summable if and only if f zk zk c is t summable for every v zk we observe that n 7 f n v f n gives an element of l 1 zk it follows that f zk is t summable if and only if it belongs to l 1 zk comparing the integral and the sum on conical regions we see that if f zk is in l 1 zk then f is identically zero the reader is left to check that the c 1 hypothesis is sufficient for the validity of the above argument proposition 4 5 if f is a polynomial the series n zk f n zn is h summable for all z tk and the sum of this series is zero proof by lemma 3 4 we see that this series is t summable and that its sum is zero for 1 6 z tk for z 1 and f homogeneous the h summability is contained in prop 4 3 where it is also shown that the sum of this series is a linear combination of n zk f n znfor certain z 6 1 and is thus equal to zero linearity proves the result for all polynomials proposition 4 6 let f g be as in corollary 3 10 with 1 then the h convergent sum h s 06 n zk f n sg n is a holomorphic function of s 6 k s 0 furthermore h has a simple pole at worst at k s 0 proof both assertions follow from equation 25 for f sg the t convergent sums on the right side of that equation are holomorphic by corollary 3 10 and nk s 0 s 1 has a simple zero at s k s 0 we discuss next an inhomogeneous situation express p r x 1 x 2 xk as the sum of homogeneous polynomials p p 0 p 1 pd assume that pd x 0 for all nonzero x rk evidently k x rk p x 0 is compact let f zk be any finite subset that contains k zk theorem 4 7 with p and f as above let g s denote the sum of the series n zkrf p x s whenever this series is h convergent let e k j d j 2 z j 0 then summation and the poisson formula 17 1 g s is defined for all s e and g cre is holomorphic this function has meromorphic continuation with simple poles denoted by g s to all of c 2 let s 0 e if g s 0 is defined then g is holomorphic at s 0 but g s 6 g s in general 3 if s z s 0 then g s is defined and equals p n s n f therefore g is holomorphic at all such s 4 if k is odd then g s p n s n f when s z s 0 remark 4 8 the requirement that k is odd in part 4 can be altered in the fol lowing manner we consider instead the h convergence of q p s zkrf where q is a homogeneous polynomial of degree e and once again denote by g the sum of the series extended meromorphically if s z and s 0 then g s is once again the negative of the sum q n p n s taken over n f under the assumption that e k is odd the proof of this is a notational modification of the proof of the theorem given below proof the statement of the theorem remains unaffected if f is replaced by a larger finite subset so we will assume that 0 f write p pd 1 r then r x is o x 1 as x so we may approximate 1 r s through the power series expansion 26 1 t s e 0 ae s t e am s t e m 1 e 0 ae s t e em s t 1 t s am s t noting that em s t c m r t m if s r and t 1 2 we deduce bounds em s r x c m r x m valid when s r and x m m r choose m so that m dre s k let w s c s r for every s w we see that x 7 pd x sem s x for x zk r f is in l 1 zk r f and furthermore these members of l 1 zk r f lie in a bounded set by remark 3 5 we see that 27 s 7 em s n zkrf pd n sem s r n is holomorphic on s r we note that r belongs to the z graded ring obtained by adjoining p 1 d to r x 1 x 2 xk we write r i ri i r i i 1 r i id where each r i j is ho mogeneous of degree j putting t r x in 26 and multiplying by pd x s we get 28 p x s pd x sem s x j pd x sbj s x with bj s x e ae s r e j by proposition 4 3 the term pd x s re j being homogeneous of degree ds j 1 j is h summable when restricted to zk r f unless ds j k and j 2 z thus it is h summable if s e denote its sum by ge j s by 28 we see that the series in question has been expressed as a linear combination of h summable series so we conclude 29 if s r s e then g s is defined and equals em s j e ae s ge j s prop 4 6 1 and 27 with arbitrarily large r combine to prove part 1 next we take s 0 e and then study i the behaviour of g on the region u s s s 0 2 d and ii the h summability of p s 0 zkrf by assumption we have p 2 z p 0 and ds 0 p k for every s u the restrictions of all the functions 18 madhav v nori listed in 28 with the exception of pd x sbp s x when restricted to z k r 0 are h summable furthermore their sums are holomorphic functions on u it only remains to consider bp s x which it is more convenient to express as the finite sum bp s x v 0 x s s 0 v 1 x s s 0 qvq x where all the vi x r x 1 xk pd are homogeneous of degree i let li s n zkrf pd n svi n for all s 6 s 0 by 4 6 we see that s s 0 ili s is holomorphic on u for all i 0 putting this together we see a g l 0 is holomorphic on u and b n zkrf p n s 0 p s 0 d n v 0 n is h summable now assume that the given series is h summable at s 0 it follows from b that p s 0 d v 0 zkrf is also h summable by 4 4 we see that p s 0 d v 0 0 it follows that p sd v 0 0 and therefore l 0 vanishes as well we conclude from a that g is holomorphic on u we see however that g s 0 g s 0 b where b is the residue of l 1 s at s 0 if k 2 p x y x 2 y 2 x s 0 0 one checks that b is precisely the residue of k s at s 1 where k q 1 which is 4 this completes the proof of part 2 proposition 4 5 implies part 3 note that d 2 z and therefore z e is empty when k is odd part 4 is now implied by parts 1 and 3 this completes the proof of the theorem 5 the formalism of the poisson formula a nice account of the poisson formula is to be found in the books of lang and weil 11 and 20 the view of this formula taken here is more sophisticated it is borrowed fromweil 21 lion vergne 13 and mumford 14 in essence it is simply the poisson formula for the original function replaced by a translate and then multiplied by a character as displayed in 47 this development expresses the fourier transform as the composite of linear operators that are defined on frechet spaces such as the schwartz space s x of c functions of rapid decay on x and c x x defined below these operators extend to certain spaces of distributions the poisson intertwining operator tb s x c x x given in 42 plays a significant role in this section formula 39 defines tbf as a sum taken over for every f s x the extended version of tb however now defined for all tempered distributions is handed to us as a package not as a sum indexed by we think of theorem 5 8 as the true poisson formula for tempered distributions for a tempered distribution u the distribution tbu is shown to be the sum of the distributions u defined in 52 this permits us to sieve out the obvious contributions to the singularities of tbu at the origin to obtain t reg b u in definition 5 10 the next objective is to give sufficient conditions that ensure t reg b u is c in a neighborhood of zero see proposition 5 11 except for the factor 2 in the fourier transform the notation here for distribu tions and operations on distributions is completely consistent with that of horman der s book 8 the facts on distributions that we use are seen in a first course on the summation and the poisson formula 19 subject they are contained in vol 1 chapter 7 8 and also to be found in chapters 6 7 of 18 5 1 review of the poisson formula our data consists of a four tuple x x b where a x and x are finite dimensional r vector spaces b b x x r is a non degenerate bilinear form and c x is a lattice i e is discrete and x is compact every x x b as above produces its dual x x b given by 30 b x x b x x x x x x with dual lattice 31 b z the compact torus z is defined by 32 z x x the haar measure on x is chosen so that vol x 1 the integral of a function with respect to this haar measure will be denoted by x f x dx or even simply by x f we put 33 t exp 2 1 t t r and 34 b x x b x x for all x x x x we recall that the schwartz space of x denoted by s x is the collection of c c valued functions f defined on x for which f m n for all non negative integers m and n where 35 f m n sup 1 x n v m mv f x x x 0 6 v x 0 m m in the above v denotes the directional derivative norms on both x and x are chosen arbitrarily and fixed once and for all the above semi norms m n give s x the structure of a topological vector space for all f s x its fourier transform fbf is the function on x defined by the absolutely convergent integral 36 fb f x x f x b x x dx if f s x then fbf s x and in fact fb s x s x is continuous this statement follows from the standard identies below valid for all u s x 37 x fbu 2 1 fbbx u and 38 fb xu 2 1 b xfbu where bx x b x x and b x x b x x for all x x x x 20 madhav v nori let us return to 36 the fourier integral this integral may be computed first by summing over x and then integrating the resulting function on x in the summation over x there is a common factor b x x which we suppress for the moment thus for f s x we define tbf x x c by the formula 39 tbf x x f x b x for the rest of this section and in 40 in particular we employ the following notation let d x x denote the space of distributions on x x the map that turns d x x into a module over the ring of infinitely differentiable functions on x x will be denoted by h u 7 h u for all infinitely differentiable h x x c and all u d x x we note that the property 40 u and b u are translation invariant by and respectively is valid for u tbf for all f s x we define the space 41 c x x to be collection of of infinitely differentiable functions u x x c that satisfy 40 formula 39 then defines the poisson intertwining operator tb 42 tb s x c x x for f g c x x the function f g x x c descends to a function f g d on the torus z defined in 32 we define 43 f g z f g d c x x has the structure of a frechet space given by the seminorms p v v m n defined for v x v x and non negative integers m n by p v v m n u sup mv nv u x x x x k where k x x is a compact subset with the property that the composite k x x z is onto the resulting topology on c x x is seen to be independent of the choice of k the theory of fourier series for c functions on x suffices to deduce the next proposition proposition 5 1 1 tb s x c x x is an isomorphism of topological vector spaces 2 f g tbf tbg for all f g s x 3 the operator sb c x x s x given by sbh x x h x x dx is the inverse of tb summation and the poisson formula 21 the passage preceding 39 shows that the fourier transform of f s x is then given by the formula 44 fbf x x tbf x x b x x dx all the above considerations are valid also for the dual x x b the space defined in 41 for x x b will be denoted by c x x the operators given in 42 and part 3 of proposition 5 1 for the dual x x b will be denoted by tb and sb respectively the fourier transform for the dual x x b will be denoted by fb we have the isomorphism 45 b c x x c x x given by 46 bh x x b x x h x x h c x x proposition 5 1 44 and the negative sign in the definition of b combine to prove the following proposition proposition 5 2 1 the operators b tb tb are isomorphisms of topological vector spaces and their inverses are b sb sb respectively 2 fb t 1 b b tb and fb t 1 b b tb and thus fb and fb are inverses of each other 3 the property f g f g for all f g in the domain of holds for b tb tb part 2 of proposition 5 2 shows tbf b tb fb f and this reads as 47 f x b x fb f x b x x f s x the standard form of the poisson formula given below is obtained by putting x x 0 0 48 f fb f f s x remark 5 3 the space of distributions resp tempered distributions on a finite dimensional real vector space v is denoted by d v resp s v a we shall define s x s x c by u f u f for all u s x f s x i the restriction of to s x s x is the standard inner product ii every continuous linear functional on s x is given by f 7 u f for a unique u s x b let d x x be the space of distributions u on x x that satisfy 40 we will define d x x c x x c 22 madhav v nori as follows for u d x x h c x x the distribution h u is invariant under translation by and therefore descends to a distribution h u d on the torus z defined in 32 denoting by 1 z the constant function 1 on z we define u f h u d 1 z i if u is also in c x x then this definition of u h agrees with the formula of 43 ii every continuous linear functional on c x x is given by h 7 u h for a unique u d x x one sees this by identifying c x x with the global c sections of a unitary line bundle l on z the compactness of z then gives the identification of c x x with the space of global sections of l d where d is the sheaf of distributions on z the latter space is canonically identified with d x x we also have a and b above for the dual x x b namely a s x s x c and b d x x c x x c proposition 5 4 for f s x s x c x x c x x let fe s x s x d x x d x x respectively every isomorphism u f 1 f 2 that occurs in proposition 5 2 extends uniquely to an isomorphism ue f 1 e f 2 e that is specified uniquely by 49 ueu uh u h for all u f 1 e h f 1 to simplify notation the extended operator ue will be denoted once again by u the identities fb t 1 b b tb and fb t 1 b b tb are valid for the extended operators as well proof properties i and ii of fe f c listed in remark 5 3 a and b combined with the last assertion of proposition 5 2 prove this statement 5 2 expression of tbu as a sum over by proposition 5 4 tbu has been defined for all u s x our next goal theorem 5 8 below is to prove the validity of 39 for u s x for this purpose we first give meaning to the th term in 39 for every distribution u on x in the standard manner in order to obtain the formula 50 x x f x b x x x dxdx x f x i x dx for all f s x and all test functions c c x x we define i c c x by 51 i x x b x x x dx for a distribution u on x we define the distribution u on x x by 52 u u i test functions c c x x summation and the poisson formula 23 by 50 we see that if u f s x then u is given by the function x x 7 f x b x as desired lemma 5 5 is required to show that u converges to a distribution on x x for c c x x we define m n sup x m x n mx nx 0 6 x x 0 6 x x 0 m m 0 n n lemma 5 5 let k x and k x be compact subsets then for every m n 0 there is a constant c k k m n with the property that the inequality 53 i m n c k k m n m n a holds for every c c k k with a 1 dimx and notation as in 35 proof putting lx x x x we first note that i x fb lx for all x x x 1 x a and the standard identities 37 imply 54 fb f 0 n c 1 n f n a f s x for every n let b 1 sup x x k we may now rewrite the above inequality for f lx in the form below 55 1 y n fb lx y bac 1 n 0 n for all x y x from the compactness of k we get c 1 for which 56 c 1 1 y x 1 y c 1 y x for all x k y x replacing n by n a in 55 we may now rewrite that inequality in the form 57 1 y a 1 y x n fb lx y bacac 1 n a 0 n a for all x y x replacing x y in the above by x we get 58 1 a 1 x n i x bacac 1 n a 0 n a for all x x taking c k k 0 n bacac 1 n a 1 a we have proved 53 when m 0 we note that i x xi for all x x we then see that the inequality 53 for 0 n applied to all the partial derivatives of of order at most m proves 53 for m n as well lemma 5 6 let c c x x then w given by w x x x x b x has the properties below 1 w c x x 2 u u w for all u d x x with as given in re mark 5 3 b 3 w c c x x c x x is surjective 24 madhav v nori proof let x x be an open subset whose translates by all are all disjoint with z as in 32 let p x x z denote the projection let be a test function with supp we observe 59 h c x x h supp h p 1 p h w let u d x x recall that w u descends to a distribution w u d on z we have u w w u d 1 z note that w u d 1 z w u dg if g z c is a c function such that g z 1 on an open subset of z that contains p supp to obtain such a g we choose another test function on x x satisfying supp and supp 1 1 and let g z c be the unique function with supp g p and z g p z for all z we then have u w w u dg u u u this proves the first two assertions for such the linear span of c c taken over all as above is the collection of all test functions thus the first two assertions of the lemma follow from linearity the same reasoning combined with 59 proves the third assertion as well lemma 5 7 let j i for all c c x x for every x x the finite sum j x equals x w x x proof now j x x b x x x dx once again this integral may be computed by first summing over x and then integrating the resulting function on x so we get 60 a x x b x x x and j x x a x x and now summing the above over we get 61 w x x a x x and j x x w x x for a tempered distribution u onx part 4 of theorem 5 8 expresses tbu as a sum of distributions on x x part 5 of the theorem is the identity tbu b tb fbu which is the generalized poisson formula 47 when u f s x theorem 5 8 poisson formula for tempered distributions let u be a tempered distribution on x 1 let s be a subset of for every c c x x the series s u converges absolutely see 52 for the definition of u 2 denote the sum of the above series by us then 7 us defines a distribu tion on x x 3 if s is the disjoint union of subsets s s then us us us 4 the distribution tbu given by proposition 5 4 equals the above us when s 5 u b fbu summation and the poisson formula 25 proof let u s x by definition there are some m n c so that u f c f m n recall that u u i for all g lemma 5 5 now shows that s u i c c k k m n m n a c c k k that proves part 1 the same upper bound holds for us as well and now part 2 follows from the definition of a distribution part 3 is evident we now address part 4 it is clear that u is in d x x by proposition 5 4 the identity tbu u is equivalent to the equality u tbf u f for all f s x now sb in proposition 5 2 is surjective and so is w see lemma 5 6 3 so it suffices to check this equality for f sbw for all c c x x in other words we have to check u w u sbw for all c c x x we note u w u u i u j u x w u sbw u sbw from 5 6 2 and 5 7 and this completes the proof of part 4 the validity of part 4 for both x x b and x x b combined with proposition 5 4 now implies part 5 and therefore completes the proof of the theorem 5 3 removal of singularities and the definition of t reg b u lemma 5 9 let u s x let u x be an open subset so that the restriction u u is given by a continuous function f u c let a be a subset of let x be an open subset so that a u assume further that a f then the distribution ua given in theorem 5 8 is given by the continuous function x 7 a f x b x on x proof let c c x and let a we observe that i c c u and also that equation 50 holds in fact for any continuous function f u c it then follows from the definition of u given in 52 that u x x f x b x x x dxdx summing over s we obtain t sbu x x s f x b x x x dxdx for all test functions with support contained in x in particular taking a we see that if is not in the singular support of u then u u x is c for a suitable neighbourhood u of zero in x this leads to the definition below 26 madhav v nori definition 5 10 the regularized distribution t reg b u is defined for u s x under the assumption that the singular supports of u and fbu denoted by k and k respectively are both compact let s k 0 and s k 0 we define t reg b u tbu s u b s fbu for the above formula one should note that u and u s are defined for arbitrary u s x s by applying 52 and 5 8 2 to the dual x x b there is no real reason here to throw 0 into the definition of s and s this has been done for the sole purpose of obtaining consistency with the usage of t regu in the next section proposition 5 11 let u v f fb v where f s x and v and v are compactly supported distributions on x and x respectively then 1 t reg b u is defined and is c on u u where u and u are suitable neighbour hoods of 0 in x and x respectively 2 let k k s s be as in definition 5 10 then part 1 holds for u and u with x r u x x k r s and x r u x x k g r s proof thanks to paley weiner schwartz see pp 180 185 chapter 8 17 we see that fbv and fb v are both c it follows that the singular supports of u and fbu are precisely the singular supports of v and v respectively these sets are compact and therefore t reg b u is defined we retain the notation k k s s introduced in 5 10 for w s x let pw s w and qw b s fbw now t reg b u is the sum of nine terms obtained by applying the three operators tb p q to the three distributions v f fb v five of these namely tbf pf qf qv and pfb v are evidently c on all of x x we claim that tb p v tb q fb v are c on u x and x u respectively where u x and u x are suitable neighborhoods of zero this claim implies part 1 of the proposition to check this claim let l be the support of v and define the subsets c d by 0 l s c and s c d by 5 8 we see that tbv vs vc vd if u is small enough we see that v u x is i c if c and ii is zero if d from the definition of vd in 5 8 it follows that vd u x is zero the finiteness of c shows that vc is c on u x now pv vs so we see that tb p v equals vc which is c on u x as claimed summation and the poisson formula 27 to go further we note that i and ii above are valid when u is the complement of the union of r 1 x x k c and r 2 x x l d we may express v f as v 1 f 1 where v 1 v and f 1 f 1 v for a test function that is 1 on an open subset v that contains k now the support of v 1 is contained in v it follows that we may replace l by k in the definition of r 2 because s c d we deduce that u can be chosen to be the complement of x x k s with r tb v s v the same argument for the dual x x b shows that r is c on u x with u as in part 2 of the proposition because tb q fb v equals b r we see that the remaining half of the claim has also been proved this completes the proof of the proposition 6 the poisson formula for mild singularities we apply the considerations of the previous section to the spaces of distributions given below the notation and operators introduced there will be employed here as well the main result of this section is theorem 6 6 formulated for distributions that belong to the space h x the spaces of distributions relevant for this theorem are given in 6 1 proposition 6 4 part 3 says that a distribution u on x belongs to h x if and only if u and its fourier transform are well behaved at infinity in a certain technical sense see 62 below part 2 of the same proposition expresses u h x as a sum of three distributions one checks the validity of theorem 6 6 for each of them separately theorem 1 2 is then deduced from theorem 6 6 subsection 6 4 has more definitions of translation invariant integrals and sums proposition 6 12 relates these definitions with the t summability of 2 1 6 1 spaces of distributions definition 6 1 we will define six spaces of distributions on x let u be a distribution on x i u belongs to h x if u is c on the region x r for some r 0 and there is some real number p with the property 62 x m mv u x is o x p as x for all v x m 0 ii u belongs to h 0 x if u is c on the region 0 x r for some r 0 and there is some real number p with the property that 63 x m mv u x is o x p as x 0 for all v x m 0 iii u is in h x if a u is c on the region 0 6 x x and b u belongs to both h 0 x and h x note however that the p s that appear for x and x 0 may be different from each other iv h x c x h x v u belongs to h 0 x if it satisfies the three conditions 28 madhav v nori i u is compactly supported ii the singular support of u is contained in 0 iii u h 0 x vi dc x is the space of compactly supported distributions on x note that if u belongs to h x then u is certainly a tempered distribution and therefore fbu is defined proposition 6 2 u h x fbu s x h 0 x proof given x x the function x 7 b x x denoted by bx in equation 37 section 5 will now be denoted simply by x let u f h x c x h x and let p r be as in 62 choose an integer k 0 so that k p dimx the inequality of 62 assumed for x 7 now implies 64 v m m r kv f l 1 x for all m 0 r 0 v x v x from 37 we deduce 65 mv v m r kfbf c 0 x for all m 0 r 0 v x v x from weyl s commutation relations one checks that for every h z 66 mv vn n m h v x v x and vn mv n m h v x v x have the same linear span in the weyl algebra of x the ring of differential operators with polynomial coefficients on x putting h k k 1 we deduce that 67 vm r k mv fbf c 0 x for all m 0 r 0 v x v x we then claim that for all v x and m 0 i x 7 mv fbf x is continuous at all 0 6 x x and ii mv fbf x c v m x k m for all 0 6 x x iii mv fbf x is o x h as x for every h z both i and ii are deduced from 67 by putting r 0 letting the v s run through a basis of x for any fixed choice of v x and m 0 whereas iii is deduced in the same manner by letting r go to infinity in 67 let c c x so that 1 1 contains a neighbourhood of zero in x then i and ii imply that fbf belongs to h 0 x whereas i and iii imply that 1 fbf belongs to s x we have now shown of the proposition for the reverse implication it suffices to prove that fb u h x whenever u h 0 x so let u be such a distribution on x let p u be the supremum of the set of p r for which the inequality of 62 is valid for x 0 we shall deal first with the case p u 0 recall that the restriction of u to x r 0 is given by a c function f x r 0 c the assumption p u 0 implies that f extends as a continuous function f x c such that f 0 0 in particular f gives rise to a distribution on x which we once again denote by f the distribution w u f is supported at 0 by a theorem of l schwartz see r 2 thm 6 25 page 150 and the identity 37 for tempered distributions the fourier transform of w is a polynomial on x and therefore belongs to h x so it remains to show that fb f is in h x because f is compactly supported its fourier summation and the poisson formula 29 transform is c so it remains only to verify the bounds on fb f imposed by 62 the bounds 63 placed on u imply that vmf is m times continuously differentiable on x for all v x it follows that the distribution mv vmf is a continuous function for all m 0 v x v x and therefore in l 1 x being compactly supported the identities 37 now show that mv fb x is o x m as x as required the general case p u k 0 is dealt with by induction on k 0 from weyl s commutation relations one sees that p v u 1 p u for all v x thus we may assume that fb v u is in h x for all v x in other words vfb u belongs to h x for every v x from this it is immediate that fb u is itself in h x this completes the proof remark 6 3 we intend to express some distributions in the form encountered in proposition 5 11 for this it is useful to note that v f fb v v 1 f 1 fb v 1 v v 1 c c x and v v 1 c c x where it is assumed that v v 1 dc x v v 1 dc x f f 1 s x indeed by paley wiener schwartz fb v v 1 is c and so it follows that v v 1 is c as well the same argument after an application of fb to both sides shows that v v 1 is c as well proposition 6 4 1 h x dc x s x fb h 0 x 2 h x h 0 x s x fb h 0 x 3 h x h x fb h x 4 fbh x h x proof we first note that a h x s x fb h 0 x b h x h x dc x c h x h 0 x h x both b and c are obtained by writing u u 1 u for suitable test functions c c x and a is just proposition 6 2 now part 1 follows from a and b and part 2 follows from a and c we come to part 3 by part 1 we may express u h x as u v f fb v where v dc x f s x v h 0 x now if u also belongs to fb h x we see that u v 1 f 1 fb v 1 with v 1 h 0 x f 1 s x v 1 dc x by remark 6 3 we see that v v 1 c c x because v 1 belongs to h 0 x we see that v belongs to the same space as well it follows that h x fb h x is the same as h 0 x s x fb h 0 x part 3 now follows from part 2 part 4 is immediate from part 3 6 2 tb and t reg b for mild singularities every in the schwartz space of x gives rise to the c function tb on x x see prop 5 2 and every tempered distribution u on x gives rise to the distribution tbu on x x see prop 5 4 every u h x is a tempered distribution on x therefore tbu is defined and we wish to study it the next lemma deals with the preliminary case where u f h x 30 madhav v nori lemma 6 5 let f h x then tbf is continuous on x x r further more tbf x x is simply the sum of the t summable series f x b x for every x x x x x proof the action of x on s x and c x x given by translations lvf x f x v and lvh x x h x v x x v x x x for all f s x h c x x extends in the standard manner to an action on s x and d x x respectively furthermore tb lv lv tb for all v x it follows that tb commutes with 1 lv m for all m 0 now let f h x choose m 0 so that mv f is o x 1 dimx employing 16 such upper bounds are valid for g 1 lv mf as well lemma 5 9 shows that the distribution tbg is a continuous function and also that tbg x x is the sum of the absolutely convergent series g x b x for all x x x x now take v let w x x b v x for all x x x x by 40 we see that tblvu w tbu for all u s x it follows that tbg 1 w mtbf the continuity of tbf on the region w 6 1 follows that the series in lemma 6 5 is t summable has already been remarked in thm 3 7 the sum of this t summable series is 1 b v x mtbg x x when b v x 6 1 by its definition now if x there is some v for which b v x 6 1 this proves the lemma that tbf is c can be proved by the same method but it is also a consequence of the theorem below because h x h x the definition of t reg b u in the next thm has been given in definition 5 10 theorem 6 6 let u h x let f x r 0 c resp f x c be the c function obtained by restricting u resp fbu to the complement of 0 in x resp in x let u x r r 0 and let u x r r 0 then 1 t reg b u is defined 2 t reg b u u is c 3 furthermore t reg b u x x equals the sum of both the t summable series below a b x x f x 06 f x b x for all x u x b f x 06 f x b x x for all x x u proof by 6 4 2 we see that u has the form encountered in 5 11 the singular supports of u and fbu are contained in 0 so parts 1 and 2 follow from 5 11 the above lemma shows that t reg b u is given by the sum in a when u h x if u h 0 x the sum in a is finite and thus equals t reg b by thm 5 8 it is clear that h x h 0 x h x therefore it has been proved that the sum in a equals t reg b u for all u h x the remaining equality is obtained by interchanging the roles of u and fbu remark 6 7 with u as given in prop 5 11 and u as above it is clear that the equality of t reg b with the sum in a holds also when u h x summation and the poisson formula 31 definition 6 8 we define lu t regb u 0 0 for u h x and lu t reg b u 0 0 for u h x we note that lu lfbu and also that l is invariant under the action of aut 6 3 proof of theorem 1 2 let us return to the situation of theorem 1 2 thus we are given a c function f x r 0 c homogeneous of type s c 1 i e f tx t sf x and f x f x for all 0 6 x x and t 0 where it is assumed that a s m dim x 1 m m 0 m z b s m 1 m m 0 m z condition a guarantees that f extends uniquely to a distribution u on x with the same homogeneity degree we see that u h x its fourier transform fbu belongs to h x and is homogeneous of type s dim x the restriction of fbu to x r 0 is a c function which will be denoted by fbf for simplicity condition b ensures that fbu is the unique homogeneous distribution on x that extends the c function fbf taking the c function f regf of thm 1 2 to be t reg b u we see that part 3 of thm 6 6 implies part 1 of thm 1 2 the next lemma proves the rest of thm 1 2 lemma 6 9 the sum of the h summable series f 0 6 equals l u as given in defn 6 8 proof the action of g gl x on distributions on x x x x is denoted by g g g respectively and 7 x denotes the inclusion r gl x let n n for a distribution w on x x or x that is invariant under translation by let unw be the sum of its translates over all the n torsion points of x for u s x and u as in 5 8 we note that unu ndimxu if n and zero otherwise summing over and simplifying we see a untbu n dimx nx tb nx 1 u the terms u for 0 resp u for 0 when u s x will be denoted by u x 0 resp u 0 x let t bu tbu u x 0 we see that a can be rewritten as b unt bu n dimx nx t b nx 1 u now write unw w u nw subtract b x x fbu 0 x from both sides of b when u h x we obtain 68 u nt bu t reg b u n dimx nx t reg b nx 1 u for all u h x all the three terms above are c at 0 0 and evaluation at this point gives 69 u nt bu 0 0 lu ndimxl nx 1 u for all u h x part 3 a of thm 6 6 has a sum indexed by 0 6 and this is precisely t bu x x because u nt bu 0 0 is the sum of the t bu 0 x taken over all the nontrivial n torsion points x of x we see that 69 is equivalent to 5 under the homogeneity assumption xu su for all positive real numbers 32 madhav v nori 6 4 translation invariant integrals and sums we define x u for certain distributions u on x proposition 6 12 shows that this definition contains t summability definition 6 10 a distribution u on x is t integrable if there is a pair f with c c x f s x that satisfy 1 x 6 0 and x f 6 0 2 u s x and f u l 1 x x u is then defined as x x f 1 x f u and is seen to be independent of the choice of f thanks to commutativity definition 6 11 a function a c is t summable if there is a pair c g of c valued functions on where c has finite support and g is rapidly decreasing i e g is o r for all r with i c 6 0 and g 6 0 ii c a c has polynomial growth and g c a belongs to l 1 a is then defined to be c 1 g 1 g c a proposition 6 12 if a c is t summable then it is t summable if a is t summable then the distribution e a a where is the dirac distribution at on x is t integrable proof the first assertion is clear for the second assertion choose any h c c x with x h 6 0 if the pair c g proves the t summability of a then the pair f given by h e c and f h e g proves the t integrability of e a 7 groups acting on sets 7 1 noncommutative canonical extension we improve the canonical extension of section 2 1 to include a possibly noncommu tative setting our data now is a an associative ring a that is not assumed to be commutative a surjective ring homomorphism a k where k is a commutative field with m ker b an inclusion m n of left a modules and c a left a module homomorphism i m k the canonical extension associated to this data is the left a module homomor phism ic mc k where mc is a a submodule of n in order to construct the canonical extension we require the collections w and w 1 w w m w n w is a left a submodule and homa w m k 0 for all a left submodules m w w w 1 the collection of w w for which there is an left a module homomorphism iw w k satisfying iw m i evidently if such an iw exists it is unique because homa w m k 0 we first check that if w 1 w 2 w then w 1 w 2 also belongs to w indeed if m w w 1 w 2 let d w w 1 note thatd m andw d are subquotients of w 1 m andw 2 m respectively it follows that homa d m k homa w d k summation and the poisson formula 33 0 and this shows that homa w m k 0 as well thusw 1 w 2 w by induction it follows that w is closed under finite sums zorn s lemma implies that w is closed under arbitrary sums we continue by showing that w 1 has the same property let w 1 w 2 w 1 by definition we have a module homomorphisms i 1 w 1 k and i 2 w 2 k that satisfy i 1 m i 2 m i let w w 1 w 2 we see that w w 1 the uniqueness of iw shows that i 1 w i 2 w we deduce that there is a i w 1 w 2 k that extends both i 1 and i 2 therefore w 1 w 2 also belongs to w 1 we deduce that w 1 is closed under arbitrary sums definition 7 1 mc w w w 1 and ic mc k is the unique a module homomorphism that restricts to the given i m k the lemma below is useful for the proposition that follows but the lemma follows straight from the definitions and so we skip its proof lemma 7 2 let w w 1 and let iw w k be the unique left a module ho momorphism that extends i m k then the canonical extension wc iw c associated to the data a a k w n iw w k is the same as mc ic we have seen that n n belongs to mc if and only if m an w 1 we spell out this condition as explicitly as we can below for n n let jn a be the left ideal that annihilates its image n n m let in a jn n m be the homomorphism that sends 1 to n the short exact sequence 0 m n n m 0 gives ext 1 a n m m the functoriality of ext in both variables given i m k and the above in a jn n m produces an element n ext 1 a a jn k we deduce that n w if and only if homa a jan k 0 for all a a and n w 1 if and only if n vanishes in addition by the long exact sequence of exta k one identifies homa a jn k and ext 1 a a jn k with homk a m jn k and homk m jn mjn k respectively under this identification the composite m jn m jn mjn n k is easily seen to be a 7 i an for all a m jn let s be the complement of m in a the condition homa a jn k 0 jn m a s jn 6 the statement below summarises this discussion lemma 7 3 let n n then n mc if and only if a jan m a for all a a and b i an 0 for all a m jn when a is commutative the condition jn m a suffices for a because jan contains jn for all a a it also suffices for b because m jn mjn we deduce that the mc ic given here in definition 7 1 is consistent with that of section 2 1 we continue with a c g and a c the augmentation homomorphism as before the canonical extension mc ic will now be denoted by mg ig if h is a subgroup we also get the canonical extension when a is replaced by c h and this will naturally be denoted by mh ih proposition 7 4 assume that h is a normal subgroup of g then 1 mh is a g submodule of mg and ig mh ih 34 madhav v nori 2 mg ig as defined above is also the canonical extension associated to the data c g mh n ih mh c proof it is evident that mh is a g module and that ih is a g invariant linear func tional by assumption there are no nonzero h invariant linear functionals on any h module w with m w mh it follows that there are no nonzero g invariant lin ear functionals on any g module w with m w mh it follows that mh w 1 the rest of the proposition follows from 7 2 from now on we concentrate on the case x is a set equipped with g action m l 1 x n cx and i m c is x when f x c belongs to mg we will say the series xf is g summable very specifically we take x qk endowed with the discrete topology equipped with the action of g qk glk q the center of glk q is denoted simply by q glk q we put h qk q g in view of the remark following lemma 7 3 the preceeding proposition and the normality of qk and h in g we have the chain of spaces l 1 qk lt qk l 1 qk qk l 1 qk h l 1 qk g where lt q k is the space of t summable functions the precise relation between h summability as above and h summability in the section 4 has not been worked out the proposition below is a lengthy verification relying on the claim that follows the details are omitted proposition 7 5 let f rk r 0 c be a c function homogeneous of type s assume f 6 0 then the series f x 0 6 x zk is h summable if and only if i s k m 1 m m 0 m z or ii f is a polynomial claim restrict the f given in the proposition to zk 0 and then extend it by zero to get g qk c then c h g l 1 qk equals b l 1 qk where b is the linear span of p d f x nzk taken over all constant coefficient differential operators p d and all x qk and all natural numbers n example 7 6 we take m 1 for k 1 this says that h q c is not h summable where given by h x x x if 0 6 x z and h x 0 for all other rational numbers x is not h summable this may also be seen very directly in the following manner assume the contrary then we see that qh x q h x x q h ax b for all a q b q taking a 1 b 0 we see that qh 0 taking a 1 b 1 we see that the sum of the series x 7 h x 1 h x indexed by x q is zero which contradicts the fact that this sum is 2 for m 1 k 2 the function f x y x x 2 y 2 has already occurred in the counterexample given in the proof of 4 7 2 acknowledgments the author thanks david mumford for introducing him to the
