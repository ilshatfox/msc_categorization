infimum of a 0 such that finite linear combinations of complex exponentials with frequencies between 0 and a are dense in l 2 the definition can be easily extended from finite to broader classes of measures in this paper we prove a new formula for t and use it to study growth and additivity properties of measures with finite positive type as one of the applications we show that frostman measures on r may only have type zero or infinity 1 introduction for a 0 denote by ea the family of complex exponential functions on r with frequencies between 0 and a ea e isx s 0 a if is a positive finite measure on r its exponential type t is defined as t inf a ea is complete in l 2 if the set on the right hand side is non empty and as infinity otherwise recall that a family of vectors in a banach space is complete in the space if finite linear combinations of vectors from the family are dense in the space the type problem the problem of finding t in terms of has many connections in fourier analysis spectral analysis of differential operators and related fields see for instance 4 5 6 7 8 9 16 17 a formula for t was recently obtained in 16 and further developed in 17 one of the implications of these results is that l 2 in the above definition of t may be replaced with any lp p 1 without changing the value of t i e that the p type of for any p 1 is equal to the 2 type although the type formula from 16 has improved existing results and gave new examples in the area of the type problem some of the natural questions remained open this note originated from one of such questions consider initial work on this article sections 1 5 was supported by nsf grant dms 1665264 the article was completed sections 6 9 with support of rnf grant 14 41 00010 1 http arxiv org abs 1803 00520 v 1 2 a poltoratski the poisson measure on the real line d x dx 1 x 2 its type t can be easily shown to be equal to infinity on the opposite end of the scale if one considers any measure with long gaps in its support see section 3 the type is equal to zero as follows from another classical result beurling s gap theorem the simplest examples of measures of zero type are measures with semi bounded or bouneded support for instance a restriction of to a half line the sharpness of beurling s theorem was demonstrated by m benedicks in 2 where further examples of absolutely continuous measures of zero and infinite type were constructed examples from 2 focused on restrictions of the poisson measure to unions of unit intervals to obtain an example of an absolutely continuous measure with finite posi tive type one needs to utilize further results on the type problem define the density f to be equal to e n 1 n 2 on each interval n n e n n z and to zero elsewhere then the type of d x f x dx is equal to 2 as follows from the results of borichev and sodin 4 or the results of 16 notice that in the last example the density is extremely unbounded while in the examples with more regular densities the type always comes out to be zero or infinity this pattern persists over all known examples giving raise to the following natural question can an absolutely continuous measure with bounded density have finite positive type in this note we give a negative answer to this question extending the result to a slightly wider class of measures a positive measure on r is poisson finite if d x 1 x 2 the definition of type given above can be easily extended from finite to poisson finite and even wider classes of measures see section 2 a positive measure on r is a frostman measure if there exist positive constants c and such that for any interval i r i c i 1 1 where i denotes the length of i it is not difficult to see that every frostman measure is poisson finite any absolutely continuous measure d x f x dx with bounded density is a frostman measure moreover if f lp r 1 p then the measure is frostman since i 6 f p i 1 p type alternative for frostman measures 3 a measure is doubling if there exists a constant c 0 such that x 2 r x 2 r c x r x r for any x r and any r 0 under an additional restriction that i d for all intervals i of fixed unit length and some d 0 a doubling measure is a frostman measure among singular measures a standard cantor mea sure on 0 1 periodically extended to the rest of r is a relevant example of a singular frostman measure as we show in theorem 4 section 6 the type of any frostman measure can only be equal to zero or infinity our result relates local properties of a measure to its type whereas previously known results only explored the relations between the type and asymptotic properties of the measure near infinity to prove theorem 4 we first obtain a new version of the type formula in section 5 theorem 3 unlike the previous versions the formula does not include a finite weight inherited from bernstein s version of the type problem see section 4 such an improvement may be useful in applications such as the problems discussed here if a measure with bounded density cannot have a finite positive type it is natural to ask how fast the density of a measure of such a type must grow we give an answer to this question in section 8 theorem 6 in section 7 we investigate additivity properties of type 2 preliminaries if f is a function from l 1 r we denote by f its fourier transform f z r f t e iztdt 2 1 let m be a set of all finite borel complex measures on the real line simi larly for m we define z r e iztd t via parseval s theorem the fourier transform may be extended to be a unitary operator from l 2 r onto itself and can be defined for even broader classes of distributions 4 a poltoratski if one extends all functions from l 2 a a as 0 to the rest of the line one can apply the fourier transform to all such functions and obtain the paley wiener space of entire functions pwa f f l 2 a a the definition of type t given in the introduction for finite measures can be naturally extended to broader classes of measures on r t 2 inf a pwa l 2 is dense in l 2 if the set of such a is non empty and as infinity otherwise via this definition one can consider the type problem in the class of polynomially growing measures i e measures such that 1 x n for some n 0 and some finite measure poisson finite measures are polynomially growing measures with n 2 we will denote the set of all polynomially growing borel complex measures on the real line by mp the notation m p will be used for the subset of positive measures note that by duality a family f of functions is not dense in lq q 1 iff there exists f lp 1 p 1 q 1 annihilating the family i e such that f g d 0 for every g from the family in such cases we write f f we denote by t p the p type of defined as t p 2 inf a f l p f 6 0 f pwa l q note that t t 2 cases p 6 2 were considered in several papers see for instance articles by koosis 10 or levin 11 for the case p it is well known that if 1 x n then t p t p which reduces the problem for polynomially growing measures to its original settings of finite measures the equality of t p p 1 to t remains true for polynomially growing measures suppose that t p a for some finite measure p 1 and a 0 by our definitions this means that there exists a function f lq 1 p 1 q 1 which annihilates ea i e such that f s e isxf x dx 0 for all s 0 a type alternative for frostman measures 5 an alternative way to extend the definition of type is to say that t a if f understood in the sense of distributions for infinite measures has no support on 0 a for some f lp f 6 0 hence the type problem becomes a version of the gap problem which stud ies measures whose fourier transform has a non trivial gap in its support as we can see to find t p is the same as to find what non zero density f l q gives the largest spectral gap for the measure f it turns out that to ap proach the type problem it is beneficial to first solve the gap problem in the case q 1 which is no longer a dual version of a p type problem 3 gap formula we say that a polynomially growing measure mp annihilates a paley wiener space pwa and write pwa if for all functions f pwa l 1 fd 0 note that pwa contains a dense set of fast decreasing functions belonging to l 1 for any polynomially growing if x is a closed subset of the real line we denote by mp x the set of polynomially growing measures supported on x we denote by gx the gap characteristic of x defined as gx 2 sup a mp x 6 0 such that pwa 3 1 when the set is non empty and zero otherwise alternatively one could define gx as the supremum of the size of the gap in the support of taken over all non zero finite measures supported on x which explains the name the problem of finding gx in terms of x has many connections and ap plications see for instance 13 17 for results and further references it was recently solved in 15 this version of the gap problem is related to the version mentioned in the last section via the following observation lemma 1 15 17 for m p t 1 gsupp as we discussed in the last section for p 1 the type t p t is different from t 1 further formulas for the type will be discussed in the next two sections to give the formula for gx 15 we will need the following definitions 6 a poltoratski a sequence of disjoint intervals in on the real line is called long in the sense of beurling and malliavin if n in 2 1 dist 2 0 in 3 2 where in stands for the length of in if the sum is finite we call in short let a 2 a 1 a 0 0 a 1 a 2 be a two sided sequence of real points we say that the intervals in an an 1 form a short partition of r if in as n and the sequence in is short i e the sum in 3 2 is finite let 1 n be a finite set of points on r consider the quantity e k j l k 6 j log k l 3 3 as usual a sequence of points l n c is called discrete if it has no finite accumulation points now we are ready to give the definition of d uniform sequences used in our type formulas let l n be a discrete sequence of distinct real points and let d be a positive number we say that l is a d uniform sequence if there exists a short partition in such that n l in d in o in as n density condition 3 4 and n 2 n log in en 1 dist 2 0 in energy work condition 3 5 where en e in the following formula for the gap characteristic of a closed set was obtained in 15 see also 17 type alternative for frostman measures 7 theorem 1 gx 2 sup d x contains a d uniform sequence if the set on the right is non empty and gx 0 otherwise 4 type formula in bernstein s settings we first approach the type problem in the settings of bernstein s weighted uniform approximation consider a weight w i e a lower semicontinuous function w r 1 that tends to as x the space cw is the space of all continuous functions on r satisfying lim x f x w x 0 we define the semi norm in cw as f w fw 1 finding conditions on w ensuring completeness of polynomials or exponen tials in cw is a classical problem see for instance 3 14 12 17 for further discussion and references for a weight w we define gw inf a ea is complete in cw we put gw 0 if the last set is empty theorem 2 17 gw 2 sup d logw n 1 2 n for some d uniform sequence l if the set is non empty and 0 otherwise as was shown by a bakan 1 ea is complete in l p 1 6 p 6 iff there exists a weight w lp such that ea is complete in cw this result yields the following corollary from the last theorem for m p we call a weight w a weight if wd corollary 1 16 let be a finite positive measure on the line let 1 p 6 and d 0 be constants 8 a poltoratski then t p 2 d if and only if for any weight w there exists a d uniform sequence l n supp such that logw n 1 2 n 4 1 note that this statement implies t p t for all p 1 the property mentioned in previous sections we will need these statements to obtain a new version of the type formula in the next section 5 type formula in lp settings definition 1 if l n r is a discrete sequence of distinct points we denote by l n the sequence of closed intervals such that each n is centered at n and has the length equal to one third of the distance from n to the rest of l note that then the intervals n are pairwise disjoint definition 2 if l is a discrete sequence we will write that d 1 l d if there exists a short partition on which l satisfies 3 4 note that if l satisfies 3 4 with some d on some short partition then the asymptotic density of l is d and therefore l cannot satisfy 3 4 with any other d on a different short partition which implies correctness of the last definition theorem 3 let m p suppose that t then t 2 max d d uniform l n such that log n 1 n 2 if the set of such d is non empty and t 0 otherwise note that he maximum on the right hand side exists whenever the set is non empty the maximal sequence can always be chosen inside the support of the measure which will be useful for us in applications the statement covers the case of finite type t which is needed for the orem 4 in the next section we would like to leave it as an open problem whether the formula can be extended to the infinite case i e if it is true that the equation with supremum in place of the maximum holds when t it is not difficult to see that if the supremum of the set on the right is infinite then t it therefore remains to check the opposite implication proof as follows from our discussion in section 2 it is enough to prove the theorem for finite type alternative for frostman measures 9 let t 2 d one can show that then there exists a weight w such that 4 1 is satisfied for some d uniform sequence l but is not satisfied for any d uniform sequence define s max d d uniform lnk l log l nk 1 nk 2 note that max can be used in the last formula instead of sup suppose that s d let be the maximal subsequence in the last formula then the subsequence l 1 lnk l satisfies d 1 l 1 0 and the corresponding sequence of intervals l 1 l nk has the property that for any subsequence l 2 lnkl l 1 d 1 l 2 0 l log l nkl 1 nkl 2 indeed if there existed l 2 l 1 d 1 l 2 0 for which the last sum were finite then by lemma 3 l 2 would have an s uniform subsequence with finite sum which would contradict maximality of now one can obtain a contradiction in the following way define a new weight w 1 to be equal to max w lnk 1 l nk 1 nk 2 on each interval l nk from l 1 and equal to w elsewhere then w 1 is a weight and therefore 4 1 must be satisfied with some d uniform sequence notice that then intersects the intervals from l 1 only for a subsequence of density zero i e there exists a subsequence n l 1 such that d 1 d 1 l 1 and lnk l nk since l 1 is an uniform sequence is an uniform sequence by lemma 4 is a d uniform sequence on which the original weight w satisfies 4 1 which contradicts our choice of w hence s d in the opposite direction suppose that there exists a d uniform sequence l such that log n 1 n 2 note that every weight w satisfies min n w x c n 10 a poltoratski on every n with c wd the sequence of points where the minima occur will give us a d uniform sequence on which w satisfies 4 1 thus t 2 d 6 type of frostman measures in this section we solve the problem of type for measures with bounded densities discussed in the introduction as it turns out our result can be formulated for a broader class of frostman measures which seems to be the right class for such a statement due to the elementary property that log i log i recall that a positive measure on r is a frostman measure if there exist positive constants and c such that x x c 6 1 for all 0 x r it easily follows that frostman measures are poisson finite theorem 4 if is a frostman measure then t equals either 0 or proof if t 2 d 0 d then there exists a d uniform sequence l such that l satisfies log n 1 n 2 6 2 where n n wlog satisfies 6 1 with c 1 and some 0 6 1 divide the interval n into mn equal subintervals so that 1 2 n 6 1 6 n mn 6 n 6 1 then the mass of each subinterval is at most n 6 and hence mn 6 since the total mass is n there exist at least 3 subintervals of mass at least n 2 mn 1 1 n n 6 3 let ln 1 and l n 2 be two of these intervals not adjacent to each other then the distance dn between the intervals is greater or equal to the length of each interval and its logarithm can be estimated from below by log dn log n mn c 1 log n c 2 which together with 6 2 implies log dn 1 n 2 6 4 type alternative for frostman measures 11 consider the sequence m composed of the centers of all such intervals ln 1 l n 2 for all n since the sequence l was d uniform and because of 6 4 is a 2 d uniform sequence our construction implies that each of the intervals m contains one of the intervals l n 1 l n 2 whose mass is at least the expression in 6 3 since n n satisfy 6 2 the sequence of intervals m satisfies log n 1 n 2 log n 1 n 2 const which implies t 4 d contradicting our initial assumption as was discussed in the introduction the last theorem has the following corollaries corollary 2 let fm where f lp r p 1 then t is either 0 or infinity corollary 3 if is a doubling measure such that sup x r x x 1 then t is either 0 or infinity 7 additivity properties of type it is natural to ask if the type of a measure satisfies any additivity condi tions in general or in special cases our first observation in this direction is that the inequality t t t fails in general indeed let and be the restrictions of lebesgue measure m to r and r respectively then t t 0 because if f l 2 l 2 then f f belongs to the hardy space h 2 h 2 and cannot vanish on a set of positive measure unless f 0 on the other hand t tm further examples of this type without semi bounded supports can be obtained using beurling s theorem and choosing to be the restriction of m to the union of odd dyadic intervals 22 n 1 22 n 2 n z and as the restriction to even intervals then once again t t 0 but t tm in the opposite direction we obviously have t max t t however the inequality t t t does not hold in general to construct an example consider n n and n n e n since both measures are supported by 1 uniform sequences t t 2 by theorem 3 in this simple case the type can be calculated directly without 12 a poltoratski any advanced results since the support of does not contain any d uniform sequences with d 1 t 2 by theorem 1 or 3 nonetheless the following splitting property holds for measures of finite positive type theorem 5 let m p t 2 d let c 1 c 2 be non negative constants such that c 1 c 2 d then there exists a closed set x r such that the measures 1 x 2 1 satisfy t 1 2 c 1 t 2 2 c 2 note that the analog of the above statement for measures of infinite type is false if is a measure with bounded density such that t c 1 is finite positive and c 2 is infinite then any restriction of will again be a measure with bounded density and therefore by theorem 4 will not have its type equal to 2 c 1 proof by theorem 3 there exists a d uniform sequence l such that the sequence of intervals l satisfies log n 1 n 2 7 1 if in is a short partition corresponding to l from the definition of d uniform sequences choose a subsequence satisfying 3 4 on in with c 1 in place of d note that the energy condition for will then be satisfied on the same partition and therefore is a c 1 uniform sequence put x n n and 1 x we claim that 1 and 2 1 are the desired measures first notice that t 1 c 1 indeed since is a c 1 uniform sequence t 1 2 c 1 by theorem 3 if t 1 2 p 2 c 1 then there exists a p uniform sequence satisfying 7 1 for 1 as was remarked after theorem 3 we can choose from x moreover we can assume that each interval n n contains at least one point from then the intervals from do not intersect the intervals n n l divide each interval n n l into two equal subintervals note that at least one of them has mass of at least one half of the original interval with respect to for each n choose the half interval with the larger mass and denote the centers of these half intervals by n n n note that n is a c 2 uniform sequence by lemma 4 the sequence is a p c 2 uniform sequence by our construction the sequence of intervals satisfies 7 1 which implies that t 2 p c 2 2 d a contradiction similarly t 2 2 c 2 type alternative for frostman measures 13 8 growth of density in the case of finite positive type as we saw from corollary 2 a measure of finite positive type cannot have bounded density it is natural to ask how fast should its density grow to this account we prove the following statement theorem 6 let m p be absolutely continuous fm suppose that t 2 d 0 d for x 0 denote mf x ess sup x x f x then 0 log 1 mf x 1 x 2 dx proof suppose that the integral from the statement is finite consider the measure x x 1 mf x this measure has bounded density and therefore has type 0 or infinity note that for any weight w u w 1 mf 1 is a weight hence there exists a d uniform sequence l such that u satisfies 4 1 but logu n logw n log 1 mf n and n log 1 mf n 1 2 n 0 log 1 mf x 1 x 2 therefore w satisfies 4 1 on the same sequence hence by corollary 1 t 2 d which implies that t therefore for any weight u there exists a 2 d uniform sequence l which satisfies 4 1 since any weight w is equal to u 1 mf x for a weight u similar to above we conclude that w satisfies 4 1 for a 2 d uniform sequence l thus by corollary 1 t 4 d a contradiction let us show that the condition of the last theorem is sharp in its scale let m r 1 be an increasing function such that 0 logm x 1 x 2 dx then there exists fm mf x 6 m x such that t is finite positive indeed put f to be equal to m n on every interval in n n 1 m n and zero elsewhere one can show that then every sequence s z such that n s log in 1 n 2 14 a poltoratski has density zero hence z is the maximal d uniform sequence from the statement of theorem 3 and t 2 9 additivity properties of uniform sequences the following lemma was proved in 15 lemma 2 let l be a sequence of real points and let in be a short partition such that l satisfies a in l in for all n with some a 0 and the energy condition 3 5 on in then for any short partition jn there exists a subsequence l which satisfies l jn o jn as n and the energy condition 3 5 on jn all d uniform sequences satisfy the following simple properties lemma 3 let l be a d uniform sequence 1 if l is a c uniform sequence then l contains a d c uniform subsequence 2 if 1 l is a c 1 uniform sequence and 2 l is a c 2 uniform sequence 1 2 then 1 2 contains a c 1 c 2 uniform subsequence proof 1 let in and jn be the short partitions from the definition of d uniform sequences in section 3 for the sequences l and correspondingly let ln be a third short partition with the property that max im im ln 6 max jm jm ln 6 o ln as n 9 1 by lemma 2 there is a subsequence l l such that l l ln o ln and l satisfies the energy condition on ln notice that then l satisfies the energy condition and the density condition with the constant d c on ln 2 similarly to the last part if in and jn are short partitions cor responding to 1 and 2 choose a short partition ln to satisfy 9 1 choose a subsequence l l like in the last part note that since l sat isfies the energy condition on ln so does l 1 2 the last sequence also satisfies the density condition with the constant c 1 c 2 on ln type alternative for frostman measures 15 a union of uniform sequences is a uniform sequence up to a sequence of density zero if the original sequences are separated from each other in the following precise sense lemma 4 let l n be a c uniform sequence and let n be a d uniform sequence let in be a sequence of disjoint intervals such that in is centered at n in 1 3 dist n l n and log in 1 n 2 suppose that in then l contains a c d uniform subse quence proof denote by pn the intervals pn 1 2 in choose the intervals qn to be centered at n and such that qn 1 3 dist n in n note that then the intervals qn pn are disjoint and satisfy log pn 1 n 2 log qn 1 n 2 9 2 as follows from lemma 2 one can choose a short partition sn on which both sequences l and have subsequences which satisfy 3 5 and 3 4 with constants c and d correspondingly wlog we will assume that the subsequences are equal to l and we will also assume that the endpoints of sn do not fall into any of the intervals pn qn and that sn 1 c l sn 1 d sn omitting the o term in subsequent formulas for each k z consider the functions uk and vk defined as follows each function uk is continuous and piecewise linear it is zero on ak where sk ak bk and its derivative is zero outside of pn sk on each pn pn sk uk grows linearly by one it follows that uk c sk on bk repeat the same construction for vk with the intervals qn in place of pn now define the functions k as uk x cx on sk and as 0 outside of sk define k as vk x dx on sk and as 0 outside of sk employing some of the techniques used in 15 we notice the following 16 a poltoratski claim 1 the functions k and k belong to the dirichlet class d with k 2 d 1 c 2 sk 2 log sk e l sk pn sk log pn o sk 2 k 2 d 1 d 2 sk 2 log sk e sk qn sk log qn o sk 2 and k k 2 d 1 c d 2 sk 2 log sk e l sk pn sk log pn qn sk log qn o sk 2 as k proof of claim the function k is a function with bounded harmonic conjugate and compactly supported on sk s derivative hence it belongs to d and its norm can be calculated as 2 d r d r d integrating by parts r d 1 s s t dt t x dx 1 s s log t x t dt dx let p 1 p 2 pn be the intervals from our construction above inside s recall that by our construction of u uk u 1 pl on each pl and to zero elsewhere since u cx we obtain s s log t x t dt dx c 2 s s log t x dtdx 2 c 2 s n m 1 1 pm pm log t x dtdx n m 1 m k 1 1 pm pk pm pk log t x dtdx i ii iii recall that the points l 1 l 2 n are the centers of the intervals p 1 p 2 pn because the distance between adjacent intervals pl pl 1 is at least max pl pl 1 for the last term we have iii 16 m k 6 n m 6 k log lm lk pn sk log pn o s 2 similarly ii 2 c 2 s 2 log s o s 2 type alternative for frostman measures 17 finally via elementary calculations i c 2 s 2 log s o s 2 combining the last three equations we obtain the statement for k the equations for k and k k can be proved similarly to finish the proof of the lemma it remains to notice that the claim implies k c d 2 sk 2 log sk e l sk 1 k 2 const k k k 2 d const k k 2 d k 2 d const k c 2 sk 2 log sk e l sk d 2 sk 2 log sk e sk 1 k 2 const since the sequences l and are c and d uniform respectively on the par tition sn the last sum is finite therefore the sequence l satisfies the energy condition 3 5 on the partition sn since it also satisfies the density condition 3 5 with a c d on sn it is a c d uniform sequence references 1 bakan a representation of measures with polynomial denseness in lp r d 0 p 1 and its application to determinate moment problems
