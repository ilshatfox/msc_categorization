elliptic surfaces the fourier restriction problem for hypersurfaces of non vanishing gaussian curvature which admit principal curvatures of opposite signs is still hardly understood in fact even for 2 surfaces the only case of a hyperbolic surface for which fourier restriction estimates could be established that are analogous to the ones known for elliptic surfaces is the hyperbolic paraboloid or saddle z xy the bilinear method gave here sharp results for p 10 3 l 05 v 05 sto 17 and this result was recently improved to p 3 25 chl 17 k 17 this paper aims to be a first step in extending those results to more general hyperbolic surfaces we consider a specific cubic perturbation of the saddle and obtain the sharp result up to the end point for p 10 3 in the application of the bilinear method we show that the behavior at small scales in our surface is drastically different from the saddle indeed as it turns out in some regimes the perturbation term assumes a dominant role which necessitates the introduction of a number of new techniques that should also be useful for the study of more general hyperbolic surfaces this specific perturbation has turned out to be of fundamental importance also to the understanding of more general classes of perturbations contents 1 introduction 2 2 transversality conditions and admissible pairs of sets 7 2 1 admissible pairs of sets u 1 u 2

stein proposed in the seventies the problem of restriction of the fourier transform to hypersurfaces given a smooth hypersurface s in rn with surface measure d s he asked for the range of exponents p and q for which the estimate s f q d s 1 q c f lp rn 1 1 holds true for every schwartz function f s rn with a constant c independent of f the sharp range in dimension n 2 for curves with non vanishing curvature was determined through work by c fefferman e m stein and a zygmund f 70 z 74 in higher dimension the sharp lp l 2 result for hypersurfaces with non vanishing gaussian curvature was obtained by e m stein and p a tomas to 75 st 86 see also strichartz str 77 some more general classes of surfaces were treated by a greenleaf gr 81 many years later general finite type surfaces in r 3 without assumptions on the curvature have been considered in work by i ikromov m kempe and d mu ller ikm 10 and ikromov and mu ller im 11 im 15 and the sharp range of stein tomas type lp l 2 restriction estimates has been determined for a large class of smooth finite type hypersurfaces including all analytic hypersurfaces the question about general lp lq restriction estimates is nevertheless still wide open fundamental progress has been made since the nineties with major new ideas introduced by j bourgain see for instance bo 91 bo 95 a and t wolff w 95 which led to a better understanding of the case of non vanishing gaussian curvature these ideas and methods were further developed by a moyua a vargas l vega and t tao mvv 96 mvv 99 tvv 98 who established the so called bilinear approach which had been anticipated in the work of c fefferman f 70 and had implicitly been present in the work of j bourgain bo 95 b for hypersurfaces with non vanishing gaussian curvature for which all principal curvatures have the same sign the same method was applied to the light cone by tao vargas see tvi 00 tvii 00 a culmination of the application of the bilinear method to such types of surfaces was reached in work by t tao t 03 a for positive principal curvatures and t wolff w 01 and t tao t 01 a for the light cone in particular in these last two papers the sharp linear restriction estimates for the light cone in r 4 were obtained in the last years j bourgain and l guth bog 11 made further important progress on the case of non vanishing curvature by making use also of multilinear restriction estimates due to j bennett a carbery and t tao bct 06 later l guth gu 16 gu 17 improved these results by using the polynomial partitioning method for the case of non vanishing curvature but principal curvatures of different signs the bilinear method was applied independently by s lee l 05 and a vargas v 05 to a specific surface the hyperbolic paraboloid or saddle they obtained a result which is analogous to tao s theorem t 03 a except for the end point b stovall sto 17 recently proved the end point case also c h cho and j lee chl 17 and j kim k 17 improved the range perhaps surprisingly at a first thought their methods did not give the desired result for any other surface with negative gaussian curvature a key element in their proofs is the fact a fourier restriction theorem for a perturbed hyperbolic paraboloid 3 that the hyperbolic paraboloid is invariant under certain anisotropic dilations and no other surface satisfies this same invariance our aim in this article is to provide some first steps towards gaining an understanding of fourier restriction to more general hyperbolic surfaces by generalizing lee s and vargas result on the saddle to certain model surface s namely the graph of the function x y xy 1 3 y 3 over a given small neighborhood of the origin observing that our specific is homogeneous under the parabolic scalings x y 7 r 2 x ry r 0 we may here assume as well that s x y xy y 3 3 x y q i i 1 2 where i 1 1 remark we do concentrate here on the seemingly particular case of a perturbation of the form y 3 3 in order to not to have to deal with additional technical issues which come up when studying more general perturbations say of the form f y but should like to mention that the understanding of this particular perturbation is indeed the key to understanding more general ones depending on x or y only indeed in the follow up preprint bmv 18 we show how finite type perturbations f y can be essentially reduced to the special case studied here and in further article we shall also study flat perturbations f y as usual it will be more convenient to use duality and work in the adjoint setting if r denotes the fourier restriction operator g 7 rg g s to the surface s its adjoint operator r is given by r f ef where e denotes the fourier extension operator given by ef f d s s f x e i x d s x 1 3 with f lq s s the restriction problem is therefore equivalent to the question of finding the appropriate range of exponents for which the estimate ef lr r 3 c f lq s d s holds true with a constant c independent of the function f lq s d s by identifying a point x y q with the corresponding point x y x y on s we may regard our fourier extension operator e as well as an operator mapping functions on q to functions on r 3 which in terms of our phase function x y xy y 3 3 can be expressed more explicitly in the form ef q f x y e i 1 x 2 y 3 x y x y dxdy if 1 2 3 r 3 with a smooth density our main result is the following theorem 1 1 assume that r 10 3 and 1 q 2 r and let e denote the fourier extension operator associated to the graph s of the above phase function then ef lr r 3 cr q f lq q for all f lq q 4 s buschenhenke d mu ller and a vargas in the remaining part of this section we shall describe our strategy of proof and some of the obstacles that have to be dealt with we are going to follow the bilinear approach which is based on bilinear estimates of the form eu 1 f 1 eu 2 f 2 p c u 1 u 2 f 1 2 f 2 2 1 4 here eu 1 and eu 2 are the fourier extension operators associated to patches of sub surfaces si graph ui s i 1 2 with ui q what is crucial for obtaining useful bilinear estimates is that the two patches of surface s 1 and s 2 satisfy certain transversality conditions which are stronger than just assuming that s 1 and s 2 are transversal as hypersurfaces i e that all normals to s 1 are transversal to all normals to s 2 indeed what is needed in addition is the following translate the patches s 1 and s 2 so that they intersect in a smooth curve then the normals to say s 1 for base points varying along this intersection curve form a cone 1 what is needed in the bilinear argument is that all the normals to the surfaces s 2 pass transversally through this cone 1 and that the analogous condition holds true with the roles of s 1 and s 2 interchanged for more details on this condition we refer to the corresponding literature dealing with bilinear estimates for instance l 05 v 05 lv 10 or be 16 in particular according to theorem 1 1 in l 05 transversality is achieved if the modulus of the following quantity z z 1 z 2 z 1 z 2 h 1 z z 2 z 1 z 2 z 1 1 5 is bounded from below for any zi xi yi z i ui i 1 2 z x y u 1 u 2 h denoting the hessian of if this inequality holds then we have 1 4 for p 5 3 with a constant c that depends only on an lower bound of the modulus of 1 5 and on upper bounds for the derivatives of if u 1 and u 2 are sufficiently small with sizes depending on upper bounds of the first and second order derivatives of and a lower bound for the determinant of h this condition reduces to the estimate z z 1 z 2 c 1 6 for zi xi yi ui i 1 2 z x y u 1 u 2 where z z 1 z 2 h 1 z z 2 z 1 z 2 z 1 1 7 it is easy to check that for x y xy y 3 3 we have z z 1 z 2 2 y 2 y 1 x 2 x 1 y 1 y 2 y y 2 y 1 1 8 2 y 2 y 1 z z 1 z 2 1 9 this should be compared to the case of the non perturbed hyperbolic paraboloid the saddle 0 x y xy where we would simply get 2 y 2 y 1 x 2 x 1 in place of 1 9 since z x y u 1 u 2 it will be particularly important to look at the expression 1 9 when z z 1 u 1 and z z 2 u 2 as above if u 1 and u 2 are sufficiently small we can actually reduce to this case we then see that for our perturbed saddle still the difference a fourier restriction theorem for a perturbed hyperbolic paraboloid 5 y 2 y 1 in the y coordinates plays an important role as for the unperturbed saddle but in place of the difference x 2 x 1 in the x coordinates now the quantities z 1 z 1 z 2 x 2 x 1 y 2 y 2 y 1 1 10 z 2 z 1 z 2 x 2 x 1 y 1 y 2 y 1 1 11 become relevant observe also that z z 1 z 2 z z 2 z 1 1 12 it is important to notice that the constants c u 1 u 2 in the bilinear estimates 1 4 will strongly depend on the sizes of the quantities appearing in 1 9 1 11 as well as on the size of the derivatives of in the case of the saddle since the transversality is here given by 2 y 2 y 1 x 2 x 1 it is natural to perform a kind of whitney decomposition with respect to the diagonal of q q into direct products u 1 u 2 of pairs of bi dyadic rectangles u 1 u 2 of the same dimension 1 2 which are separated in each coordinate by a distance proportional to the sizes 1 respectively 2 and then apply a scaling transformation of the form x y 1 x 2 y this is exactly what had been done in l 05 and v 05 since the phase xy is homogeneous under such kind of scalings in the new coordinates x y one has then reduced the bilinear estimates to the case of normalized patches u 1 u 2 of size 1 1 for which the transversalities are also of size 1 and from there on one could essentially apply the uniform bilinear estimates similar to those known from the elliptic case and re scale them to go back to the original coordinates coming back to our perturbed saddle we shall again try to scale in order to make both transversalities become of size 1 however as it will turn out the right patches u 1 u 2 to be used will in general no longer be bi dyadic rectangles but in some case a dyadic square u 1 and a bi dyadic curved box u 2 the right scalings which will reduce matters to situations where all transversalities are of size 1 will be anisotropic and this will create a new problem while the saddle is invariant under such type of scaling i e for the function 0 x y xy we have 1 1 2 0 x 1 y 2 0 x y for our function the scaled function s x y 1 1 2 x 1 y 2 is given by s x y xy 22 y 3 3 1 thus if 1 2 2 then the second term can indeed be view as a small perturbation of the leading term xy and we can proceed in a very similar way as for the saddle however if 1 2 2 then the second cubic term can assume a dominant role and the treatment of this case will require further arguments in conclusion the na f approach which would try to treat our surface s as a perturbation of the saddle and which does indeed work for stein tomas type lq l 2 restriction estimates breaks down if we want to derive restriction estimates of more general type by means of the bilinear method in order to get some better idea on how to suitably devise the right pairs of patches u 1 u 2 for our whitney type decomposition note that the quantities z 2 z 1 z 2 and z 1 z 1 z 2 can be of quite different size for instance for z 01 0 0 and z 0 2 1 1 we have z 01 z 01 z 0 2 while z 02 z 01 z 0 2 1 therefore there can be a strong imbalance in the two transversalities 6 s buschenhenke d mu ller and a vargas for the perturbed saddle this is quite different from the situation of the saddle where the two quantities 1 10 1 11 are the same namely x 2 x 1 nevertheless observe that due to the following important relation between the two transver salities z 1 z 1 z 2 z 2 z 1 z 2 y 2 y 1 2 1 13 which is immediate from 1 10 1 11 we see that at least one of the two transversalities z 1 z 1 z 2 or z 2 z 1 z 2 cannot be smaller than y 2 y 1 2 4 this naturally leads to two cases which we will discuss in detail in the next chapter either z 1 z 1 z 2 and z 2 z 1 z 2 have similar size and thus both are not much smaller than y 2 y 1 2 or they are of quite different size in which case one of the two transversalities has to be comparable to y 2 y 1 2 while the other one can be much smaller in section 2 we shall make a finer analysis of the transversality conditions and introduce the pairs of sets fit to them admissible pairs in section 3 we shall state and prove the sharp bilinear estimates for those pairs in section 4 we will use the admissible pairs to build a whitney type decomposition of q q further difficulties arise in the passage from bilinear to linear fourier extension which will be discussed in section 5 in order to exploit all of the underlying almost orthogonality we shall have to further decompose the curved boxes u 2 whenever they appear into smaller squares and also make use of some disjointness properties of the corresponding pieces of the surface s in contrast to what is done in the case of elliptic surfaces as well as for the saddle it turns out that for the perturbed saddle it is not sufficient to exploit disjointness properties with respect to the first two coordinates but also with respect to the third one a further novelty is that we have to improve on a by now standard almost orthogonality relation in lp between the pieces arising in our whitney type decomposition which needs to be employed before applying our bilinear estimates to each of these pieces as it turns out this classical estimate is insufficient for our curved boxes and we improve on it by applying a classical square function estimate associated to partitions into rectangular boxes due to rubio de francia which has had its roots in a square function estimate obtained independently by l carleson car 67 and a cordoba co 81 finally we can reassemble the smaller squares and pass back to curved boxes by means of khintchine s inequality guide to the reader the real thrust of the precise definition of admissible pairs given in subsection 2 2 will become relevant in an essential way only later in section 4 when we shall show that our admissible pairs u 1 u 2 will allow to perform a whitney type decomposition of q q to a smaller degree they are also relevant in subsection 2 5 which prepares for the reduction of our general bilinear estimates for admissible pairs in theorem 3 1 for the curved box case to the crucial prototypical case introduced in subsection 2 4 and studied in theorem 3 3 for a first reading we therefore suggest to skip subsections 2 2 and 2 5 as well as the reduction of theorem 3 1 to theorem 3 3 in section 3 and first read subsections 2 3 and 2 4 and then in subsection 3 1 the proof of the bilinear estimates of theorem 3 3 which deals with the prototypical case before coming back to subsection 2 2 convention unless stated otherwise c 0 will stand for an absolute constant whose value may vary from occurrence to occurrence we will use the notation a c b to express that 1 c a b ca in some contexts where the size of c is irrelevant we shall drop the index a fourier restriction theorem for a perturbed hyperbolic paraboloid 7 c and simply write a b similarly a b will express the fact that there is a constant c which does not depend on the relevant quantities in the estimate such that a cb and we write a b if the constant c is sufficiently small acknowledgments part of this work was developed during the stay of the second and third author at the mathematical sciences research institute at

article 2 transversality conditions and admissible pairs of sets 2 1 admissible pairs of sets u 1 u 2 on which transversalities are of a fixed size an informal discussion recall again from the introduction that the crucial transversality quantities arising in lee s estimate 1 7 are given by y 2 y 1 and 1 10 1 11 i e z 1 z 1 z 2 x 2 x 1 y 2 y 2 y 1 z 2 z 1 z 2 x 2 x 1 y 1 y 2 y 1 we shall therefore try to devise neighborhoods u 1 and u 2 of two given points z 0 1 x 0 1 y 0 1 and z 02 x 0 2 y 0 2 on which these quantities are roughly constant for zi xi yi ui i 1 2 and which are also essentially chosen as large as possible the corresponding pair u 1 u 2 of neighborhoods of z 0 1 respectively z 0 2 will be called an admissible pair the goal of this subsection is to present some of the basic ideas without being precise about details such as constants that will be hidden in the arguments in order to motivate the precise definition of admissible pairs that will be given in the next subsection which might otherwise appear a bit strange in a first step we choose a large constant c 0 1 which will be made precise only later and assume that y 02 y 0 1 c 0 for some 0 it is then natural to allow y 1 to vary on u 1 and y 2 on u 2 by at most from y 0 1 and y 0 2 respectively i e we shall assume that yi y 0 i for zi ui i 1 2 so that indeed 2 1 y 2 y 1 c 0 for zi ui i 1 2 recall next the identity 1 13 which in particular implies that z 01 z 01 z 0 2 z 02 z 01 z 0 2 c 2 0 2 2 2 we begin with case 1 assume that z 01 z 01 z 0 2 z 02 z 01 z 0 2 let us then write 2 3 z 01 z 01 z 0 2 2 where 0 note however that obviously 2 1 from 2 2 one then easily deduces that there are two subcases 8 s buschenhenke d mu ller and a vargas subcase 1 a the straight box case where z 01 z 01 z 0 2 z 02 z 01 z 0 2 or equiva lently 1 in this case also z 02 z 01 z 0 2 2 subcase 1 b the curved box case where z 01 z 01 z 0 2 z 02 z 01 z 0 2 or equiva lently 1 in this case z 02 z 01 z 0 2 2 given and we shall then want to devise u 1 and u 2 so that the same kind of conditions hold for all z 1 u 1 and z 2 u 2 i e z 1 z 1 z 2 2 and z 2 z 1 z 2 2 1 note that in view of 1 13 and 2 1 the second condition is redundant and so the only additional condition that needs to be satisfied is that for all z 1 x 1 y 1 u 1 and z 2 x 2 y 2 u 2 we have z 1 z 1 z 2 x 2 x 1 y 2 y 2 y 1 2 as said before we want to choose u 2 as large as possible w r to y 2 i e we only assume that y 2 y 0 2 let 2 4 a 0 z 01 z 01 z 0 2 x 0 2 x 0 1 y 0 2 y 0 2 y 0 1 so that a 0 2 then we shall assume that for z 2 u 2 we have say z 01 z 01 z 2 z 01 z 01 z 0 2 z 01 z 01 z 2 a 0 2 this means that we shall choose u 2 to be of the form 2 5 u 2 x 2 y 2 y 2 y 0 2 x 2 x 0 1 y 2 y 2 y 0 1 a 0 2 as for u 1 given our choice of u 2 what we still need is that z 1 z 1 z 2 z 01 z 01 z 2 2 for all z 1 u 1 and z 2 u 2 for then also z 1 z 1 z 2 z 01 z 01 z 0 2 2 for all such z 1 z 2 we therefore must require that x 1 x 0 1 y 2 y 1 y 0 1 2 on u 1 u 2 but since y 2 is allowed to vary within an interval of size we see that this requires a condition of the form y 1 y 0 1 2 assuming this we next see that we are allowed to replace y 2 in the condition x 1 x 0 1 y 2 y 1 y 0 1 2 by y 01 this leads to the condition x 1 x 0 1 y 0 1 y 1 y 0 1 2 which depends on z 1 only and thus gives our second conditions on u 1 our discussion suggests that we should finally choose u 1 of the form 2 6 u 1 x 1 y 1 y 1 y 0 1 1 x 1 x 0 1 y 0 1 y 1 y 0 1 2 note u 1 is essentially the affine image of a rectangular box of dimension 2 1 however when 1 then u 2 is a thin curved box namely the segment of a 2 neighborhood of a parabola lying within the horizontal strip where y 2 y 0 2 on the other hand when 1 then it is easily seen that u 2 is essentially a rectangular box of dimension 2 this explains why we called subcase 1 b where 1 the curved box case and subcase 1 a where 1 the straight box case case 2 assume that z 01 z 01 z 0 2 z 02 z 01 z 0 2 this case can easily be reduced to the previous one by symmetry indeed in view of 1 12 we just need to interchange the roles of z 1 and z 2 in the previous discussion so that it is natural here to define an admissible pair u 1 u 2 of type 2 of neighborhoods u 1 of z 0 1 respectively u 2 of z 0 2 by setting a fourier restriction theorem for a perturbed hyperbolic paraboloid 9 u 1 x 2 y 2 y 1 y 0 1 x 1 x 0 2 y 1 y 1 y 0 2 a 0 2 u 2 x 1 y 1 y 2 y 0 2 1 x 2 x 0 2 y 0 2 y 2 y 0 2 2 2 7 where a 0 z 02 z 02 z 0 1 2 2 precise definition of admissible pairs within q q in view of our discussion in the previous subsection we shall here devise more precisely certain dyadic subsets of q q which will assume the roles of the sets u 1 respectively u 2 in such a way that on every pair of such sets each of our transversality functions is essentially of some fixed dyadic size and which will moreover lead to a kind of whitney decomposition of q q as will be shown in section 4 to begin with as before we fix a large dyadic constant c 0 1 in a first step we perform a classical dyadic decomposition in the y variable which is a variation of the one in tvv 98 for a given dyadic number 0 1 we denote for j z such that j 1 by ij the dyadic interval ij j j of length and by vj the corresponding horizontal strip vj 1 1 ij within q given two dyadic intervals j j of the same size we say that they are related if their parents are adjacent but they are not adjacent we divide each dyadic interval j in a disjoint union of dyadic subintervals ikj 1 k c 0 8 of length 8 j c 0 then we define i i to be an admissible pair of dyadic intervals if and only if there are j and j related dyadic intervals and 1 k j c 0 8 such that i ikj and i i j j we say that a pair of strips vj 1 vj 2 is admissible and write vj 1 vj 2 if ij 1 ij 2 is a pair of admissible dyadic intervals notice that in this case c 0 8 j 2 j 1 c 0 2 2 8 one can easily see that this leads to the following disjoint decomposition of q q q q vj 1 vj 2 vj 1 vj 2 2 9 where the first union is meant to be over all such dyadic s in a second step we perform a non standard whitney type decomposition of any given admissible pair of strips to obtain subregions in which the transversalities are roughly constant to simplify notation we fix and an admissible pair vj 1 vj 2 and simply write ii iji vi vji i 1 2 so that ii is an interval of length with left endpoint ji and v 1 1 1 i 1 v 2 1 1 i 2 2 10 are rectangles of dimension 2 which are vertically separated at scale c 0 more precisely for z 1 x 1 y 1 v 1 and z 2 x 2 y 2 v 2 we have y 2 y 1 j 2 j 1 i e c 0 2 y 2 y 1 c 0 2 11 let 0 2 be a dyadic number note that could be big depending on and let i be the set of points which partition the interval i into dyadic intervals of the same length 2 10 s buschenhenke d mu ller and a vargas similarly for i 1 2 we choose a finite equidistant partition ii of width 1 of the interval ii by points y 0 i ii note if 1 then 1 and we can choose for ii just the singleton ii y 0 i where y 0 i is the left endpoint of ii definition 2 1 for any parameters x 01 t 0 2 i y 0 1 i 1 defined in the previous lines and y 0 2 the left endpoint of i 2 we define the sets u x 01 y 0 1 1 x 1 y 1 0 y 1 y 0 1 1 0 x 1 x 0 1 y 0 1 y 1 y 0 1 2 u t 02 y 0 1 y 0 2 2 x 2 y 2 0 y 2 y 0 2 0 x 2 t 0 2 y 2 y 2 y 0 1 2 2 12 and the points 2 13 z 01 x 0 1 y 0 1 z 0 2 x 0 2 y 0 2 t 0 2 y 0 2 y 0 2 y 0 1 y 0 2 observe that then z 01 u x 01 y 0 1 1 v 1 and z 0 2 u t 02 y 0 1 y 0 2 2 v 2 indeed z 0 i is in some sense the lower left vertex of ui and the horizontal projection of u t 02 y 0 1 y 0 2 2 equals i 2 moreover if we define a 0 by 2 4 we have that x 0 1 a 0 t 02 so that our definitions of the sets u x 01 y 0 1 1 and u t 02 y 0 1 y 0 2 2 are very close to the ones for the sets u 1 and u 2 cf 2 6 2 5 in the previous subsection in particular u x 01 y 0 1 1 is again essentially a paralellepiped of sidelengths 2 1 containing the point x 01 y 0 1 whose longer side has slope y 0 1 with respect to the y axis similarly if 1 then u t 02 y 0 1 y 0 2 2 is a thin curved box of width 2 and length contained in a rectangle of dimension 2 whose axes are parallel to the coordinate axes namely the part of a 2 neighborhood of a parabola containing the point x 01 y 0 1 which lies within the horizontal strip v 2 if 1 then u t 02 y 0 1 y 0 2 2 is essentially a rectangular box of dimension 2 lying in the same horizontal strip note also that we have chosen to use the parameter t 02 in place of using x 0 2 here since with this choice the identity 2 14 z 01 z 01 z 0 2 t 0 2 x 0 1 holds true which will become quite useful in the sequel we next have to relate the parameters x 01 t 0 2 y 0 1 y 0 2 in order to give a precise definition of an admissible pair here and in the sequel we shall always assume that the points z 01 z 0 2 associated to these parameters are given by 2 13 definition 2 2 let us call a pair u x 01 y 0 1 1 u t 02 y 0 1 y 0 2 2 an admissible pair of type 1 at scales and contained in v 1 v 2 if the following two conditions hold true c 20 4 2 z 01 z 01 z 0 2 t 0 2 x 0 1 4 c 2 0 2 2 15 c 20 512 2 1 z 02 z 01 z 0 2 5 c 2

perturbed hyperbolic paraboloid 11 observe that by 1 13 we have z 02 z 01 z 0 2 z 01 z 01 z 0 2 y 0 2 y 0 1 2 in view of 2 15 and 2 11 this shows that condition 2 16 is automatically satisfied unless 1 we remark that it would indeed be more appropriate to denote the sets p by p v 1 v 2 but we want to simplify the notation in all instances in the rest of the paper p will be associated to a fixed admissible pair of strips v 1 v 2 so that our imprecision will not cause any ambiguity lemma 2 1 if u x 01 y 0 1 1 u t 02 y 0 1 y 0 2 2 is an admissible pair of type 1 then for all z 1 z 2 u x 01 y 0 1 1 u t 02 y 0 1 y 0 2 2 z 1 z 1 z 2 8 c 2 0 2 and z 2 z 1 z 2 1000 c 2 0 2 1 proof note that z 1 z 1 z 2 x 2 x 1 y 2 y 2 y 1 t 0 2 x 0 1 2 17 x 2 t 0 2 y 2 y 2 y 0 1 x 1 x 0 1 y 0 1 y 1 y 0 1 y 01 y

where z 1 z 1 z 2 z 2 z 1 z 2 by interchanging the roles of z 1 and z 2 compare also with 1 12 we define accordingly for any t 0 1 x 0 2 i y 0 1 the left endpoint of i 1 and y 0 2 i 2 the sets u t 01

pair of type 2 at scales and contained in v 1 v 2 note that this means that u x 02 y 0 2 2 u t 01 y 0 1 y 0 2 1 is an admissible pair of type 1 in v 2 v 1 at the same scales by p we shall denote the set of all admissible pairs of type 2 at scale and contained in v 1 v 2 and by p the corresponding unions over all dyadic scales in analogy with lemma 2 1 we have lemma 2 2 if u 1 u 2 u t 01 y 0 1 y 0 2 1 u x 02 y 0 2 2 p is an admissible pair of type 2 then for all z 1 z 2 u 1 u 2 we have z 1 z 1 z 2 1000 c 2 0 2 1 and z 2 z 1 z 2 8 c 2 0 2 2 3 the exact transversality conditions in the curved box case i e when 1 it turns out that one cannot directly reduce the bilinear fourier extension estimates over admissible pairs to lee s theorem 1 1 in l 05 since that would not give us the optimal dependence on we shall therefore have to be more precise about the required transversality conditions so let us recall in more detail the exact transversality conditions mentioned in the introduction that we need for the bilinear argument as references to this by now standard argument we refer for instance to l 05 and v 05 in this bilinear argument we assume that we are given two patches of subsurfaces si zi zi zi ui i 1 2 of s for fixed points z 1 u 1 and z 2 u 2 we consider the translated surfaces s 1 s 1 z 2 z 2 and s 2 s 2 z 1 z 1 we will assume in this subsection that there is a constant c 0 such that z c for all z u 1 u 2 the implicit constants in the argument will depend on this c we will not make any assumption about other derivatives of and will keep track of the dependence on them of the transversalities that will be important in the rest of the section if the normals to these two surfaces si at the points z i z i i 1 2 are not parallel we can locally define the intersection curve z 1 z 2 s 1 s 2 s 1 z 2 z 2 s 2 z 1 z 1 note that s 1 z z z 2 z 2 z u 1 z 2 and s 2 z z z 1 z 1 z u 2 z 1 set z z z 1 z 1 z z 2 z 2 then the orthogonal projection of the curve z 1 z 2 on the z plane is the curve given by z z 0 we introduce a parametrization by arc length t t j of this curve where t is from an open interval j notice that t depends on the choices of z 1 and z 2 by n x y we denote the following normal to our surface a fourier restriction theorem for a perturbed hyperbolic paraboloid 13 s at x y x y s n x y t x y 1 note that these normal vectors are of size n x y 1 then the vector n 2 z n z z 1 is normal to the translated surface s 2 at the point z z 1 z 1 z 1 and we consider the cone of normals of type 2 along the intersection curve 2 sn 2 t s r t j in an analogous way we define the cone 1 of normals of type 1 along the intersection curve in the bilinear argument see for instance v 05 final remark on page 110 the condition which is needed is that the normal vectors to s at all points of s 1 are transversal to the cone 2 more precisely that det n z 1 n z 1 n 2 t n 2 t d dt n 2 t d dt n 2 t c 0 2 20 for all z 1 u 1 and all t j and that the symmetric condition holds true when the roles of s 1 and s 2 are interchanged i e for s 2 and 1 the above determinant is equal to tv 2 z 2 z 1 det t z 1 t z 2 h z 2 t 1 1 0 1 z 1 2 1 z 2 2 h z 2 t 2 21 where t for t such that t z 2 z 1 a similar expression is obtained for s 2 and 1 namely tv 1 z 1 z 2 det t z 2 t z 1 h z 1 t 1 1 0 1 z 2 2 1 z 1 2 h z 1 t where here we assume that z 2 u 2 and z 1 u 1 is such that z 1 z 2 s for some s j and then s condition 2 20 can be written as tv 1 z 1 z 2 tv 2 z 2 z 1 c 0 2 22 notice that formally tv 2 z 2 z 1 tv 1 z 2 z 1 though z 1 and z 2 should also be inter changed moreover one easily shows that tv 2 z 2 z 1 z 1 z 2 j h z 2 t 1 z 1 2 1 z 2 2 h z 2 t 2 23 where j denotes the symplectic matrix j 0 1 1 0 14 s buschenhenke d mu ller and a vargas at this point it is interesting to explain how the quantities tv 1 and tv 2 relate to z defined by 1 5 going back to 2 21 note that det t z 1 t z 2 h z 2 t 1 1 0 det h z 2 0 0 1 det h z 2 1 t z 1 h z 2 1 t z

this section we shall present a prototypical case where u 1 and u 2 will form an admissible pair of type 1 centered at z 01 0 u 1 and z 0 2 u 2 with 1 i e y 01 y 0 2 1 and z 02 z 01 z 0 2 1 but z 01 z 01 z 0 2 1 this means that we shall be in the curved box case recall from the introduction the identity given by 1 8 and 1 9 as we will show in subsection 2 5 in detail we can always reduce to this particular situation when the two transversalities z 02 z 01 z 0 2 and z 01 z 01 z 0 2 are of quite different sizes fix a small number 0 c 0 1 c 0 10 10 will for instance work assume that 0 1 10 and put u 1 0 c 2 0 0 c 0 2 26 u 2 x 2 y 2 0 y 2 b c 0 0 x 2 y 2 2 a c 2 0 2 27 where b 2 1 and a 4 remark note that if we set c 0 1 c 0 c 0 then any admissible pair u 1 u 2 u 0 0 1 u a 0 b 2 would satisfy 2 26 and 2 27 with the above conditions on a and b observe that for z 1 x 1 y 1 u 1 and z 2 x 2 y 2 u 2 we have y 1 y 2 1 moreover 0 0 u 1 and 0 0 0 0 x 2 y 2 for all x 2 y 2 u 2 which easily implies that more generally x 1 y 1 x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 for all x 1 y 1 u 1 and x 2 y 2 u 2 moreover x 2 y 2 x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 1 for all x 1 y 1 u 1 and x 2 y 2 u 2 one easily computes also that tv 1 z 1 z 2 and tv 2 z 2 z 1 1 respectively thus there is an unlucky discrepancy between those two transversalities since 1 and a straight forward application of the bilinear method would lead to a worse dependency on of the constant in the bilinear estimate for these sets than the estimate 3 1 in theorem 3 3 which we shall need a fourier restriction theorem for a perturbed hyperbolic paraboloid 15 in the following lines we shall therefore apply a suitable scaling which will turn both transversalities to become of size 1 the price however that we shall have to pay is that after scaling the curvature of one of the two patches of surface will become large compare 2 29 so that we still cannot apply standard bilinear estimates but shall have to go into more detail into the proof of those estimates those details will be given in subsection 3 1 to overcome the afore mentioned problem we introduce the scaling s z 1 a az where a is a regular matrix a real concretely we choose x y z az x y i e x 1 x y y and a deta denote by u si a 1 ui the re scaled domains ui and by s s i the scaled surface patches ssi x y s x y x y u si explicitly we then have s x y x y 1 3 y 3 hence s x y y x 1 y 2 y 1 x y 2 2 28 and h s x y 0 1 1 2 1 y 0 1 1 2 1 y 2 29 in particular we see that s z 1 2 30 for all z az u 1 u 2 let us also put a a b b so that b 2 1 and a 4 1 and choose zi az i ui i 1 2 then by 2 26 2 27 we have that y 2 y 1 b o c 0 and x 1 y 2 1 2 c 0 while x 2 y 2 2 a o c 0 we conclude by 2 28 that s z 2 s z 1 b a o c 0 this shows that if the vector 1 2 is tangential to the intersection curve of s s 1 and ss 2 then a b o c 0 2 31 in combination with 2 29 this implies that h s z i t t b a 2 b 1 yi o 1 1 yi c 0 and h s z i t 1 1 yi 2 32 16 s buschenhenke d mu ller and a vargas by 2 23 the transversalities for the scaled patches of surface ssi and the scaled function s i 1 2 are thus given by tv si z 1 z 2 1 i 1 s z 1 s z 2 j h s z i t 1 s z 1 2 1 s z 2 2 h s z i t 2 b a b 1 yi o 1 1 yi c 0 1 1 yi now if i 1 then y 1 c 0 i e 1 yi c 0 1 so that clearly tv s 1 z 1 z 2 1 and if i 2 then yi b c 0 1 which easily implies that 2 b a b 1 yi o 1 1 yi c 0 1 and also 1 1 yi 1 so that tv s 2 z 1 z 2 1 we have thus shown lemma 2 3 the transversalities for the scaled patches of surface ssi i 1 2 satisfy tv si z 1 z 2 1 i 1 2 2 5 reduction to the prototypical case let u 1 u 2 p be an admissible pair of type 1 where u 1 u x 01 y 0 1 1 and u 2 u t 02 y 0 1 y 0 2 2 in this section we shall see that the bilinear estimates associated to the sets u 1 u 2 can easily be reduced by means of a suitable affine linear transformation to either the classical bilinear estimate in l 05 when 1 10 or to the estimate for the special prototype situation given in subsection 2 4 when 1 10 recall from 2 13 that we then had put z 01 x 0 1 y 0 1 u 1 z 0 2 x 0 2 y 0 2 t 0 2 y 0 2 y 0 2 y 0 1 y 0 2 u 2 we translate the point z 01 to the origin under the corresponding translation the phase function changes as follows z 01 z x 0 1 x y 0 1 y 1 3 y 01 y 3 x y 1 3 y 3 y 01 y 2 affine linear terms x y 01 y y 1 3 y 3 affine linear terms it is therefore convenient to introduce new coordinates z x y by putting x x y 01 y x x 0 1 y 0 1 y y 0 1 y y y y 01 2 33 then in these new coordinates the phase function is given by z z affine linear terms 2 34 noticing that affine linear terms in the phase function play no role in our fourier extension estimates we may thus assume that in view of the size of the sets ui we perform a a fourier restriction theorem for a perturbed hyperbolic paraboloid 17 further scaling transformation by writing x 2 1 x y y then clearly x y 3 1 x y if we put z xy y 3 3 1 thus altogether we define the change of coordinates z t z by x 1 1 2 x x 01 y 0 1 y y 0 1 y 1 y y 01 notice that from the following lemma in the case 1 10 it is easy to pass to the prototypical case by another harmless scaling x y c 20 x c 0 y we shall skip the details lemma 2 4 we have z 3 1 tz l z 2 35 where l is an affine linear map moreover in these new coordinates u 1 u 2 correspond to the sets u 1 t u 1 x y 0 y 1 0 x 1 0 1 2 2 36 u 2 t u 2 x y 0 y b 1 x y 2 1 a 1 2 37 where b 1 y 02 y 0 1 2 c 0 and a 2 1 1 t 02 x 0 1 4 c 2 0 1 c 20 1 moreover for lee s transversality expression in 1 5 for we have that z 1 z 1 z 2 c 3 0 1 for all z 1 u 1 z 2 z 1 z 2 c 3 0 for all z 2 u 2 2 38 for every z 1 u 1 and every z 2 u 2 also for 1 10 the derivatives of can be uniformly independently of bounded from above proof the first identity 2 35 is clear from our previous discussion the identities 2 36 2 37 and the formulas for a and b follow by straight forward com putation and the statements about the sizes of a and b follow from 2 11 and 2 15 recall that zi z 1 z 2 h 1 zi z 2 z 1 z 2 z 1 and denote by z 1 z 1 z 2 the corresponding quantity associated to these are obviously related by z i z 1 z 2 1 3 1 t 1 z i t 1 z 1 t 1 z 2 recall also from 1 9 that z 1 z 1 z 2 2 y 2 y 1 z 1 z 1 z 2 and z 2 z 1 z 2 2 y 2 y 1 z 2 z 1 z 2 thus by lemma 4 1 and 2 11 we have that for z 1 u 1 z 2 u 2 t 1 z 1 t 1 z 1 t 1 z 2 c 3 0 2 t 1 z 2 t 1 z 1 t 1 z 2 c 3 0 2 1 hence z 1 z 1 z 2 c 3 0 1 z 2 z 1 z 2 c 3 0 moreover by 1 8 if z 1 z 1 u 1 and z 2 z 2 u 2 then z 1 z 1 z 2 z 1 z 1 z 2 y 2 y 1 2 y 1 y 1 c 2 0 2 1 c 20 3 18 s buschenhenke d mu ller and a vargas and z 2 z 1 z 2 z 2 z 1 z 2 y 2 y 1 2 y 2 y 2 c 2 0 2 c 20 3 1 hence for c 0 sufficiently large t 1 z 1 t 1 z 1 t 1 z 2 c 3 0 3 t 1 z 2 t 1 z 1 t 1 z 2 c 3 0 3 1 hence z 1 z 1 z 2 c 3 0 1 z 2 z 1 z 2 c 3 0 this proves 2 38 for 1 does not depend on and the claim in the last statement of the lemma is trivially verified 3 statements of the bilinear estimates the proofs we are now in a position to establish the following sharp bilinear fourier extension esti mates for admissible pairs theorem 3 1 let p 5 3 q 2 then for every admissible pair u 1 u 2 p at scale the following bilinear estimates hold true eu 1 f eu 2 g p cp q 2 1 1 p 1 q 6 1 1 p 1 q f q g q if 1 and eu 1 f eu 2 g p cp q 5 3 q 6 p 6 1 1 p 1 q f q g q if 1 with constants that are independent of the given pair of and of remark 3 2 recall that for 1 the sets u 1 and u 2 are essentially rectangular boxes of dimension 2 and notice that our estimates for this case do agree with the ones given in proposition 2 1 in v 05 for the case of the saddle by the considerations in the previous section theorem 3 1 reduces to the following state ment for the prototypical case theorem 3 3 prototypical case let p 5 3 1 10 and let u 1 u 2 be an admissible pair given by 2 26 2 27 then eu 1 f 1 eu 2 f 2 p cp 7 2 6 p f 1 2 f 2 2 3 1 for every f 1 l 2 u 1 and f 2 l 2 u 2 we begin by explaining in more detail here the reduction of theorem 3 1 to theorem 3 3 subsection 3 1 will then be devoted to the proof of theorem 3 3 reduction of theorem 3 1 to theorem 3 3 fix p 5 3 and q 2 and assume without loss of generality that u 1 u x 01 y 0 1 1 and u 2 u t 02 y 0 1 y 0 2 2 form an admissible pair of type 1 assume first that 1 10 in this case lemma 2 4 shows that the conditions of lee s theorem 1 1 in l 05 are satisfied for the patches of surface s 1 and s 2 which are the graphs of over the sets u 1 and u 2 given by 2 36 and 2 37 and we can conclude that there is a a fourier restriction theorem for a perturbed hyperbolic paraboloid 19 constant c 0 which does not depend on u 1 u 2 such that e u 1 f e u 2 g p cp f 2 g 2 here the operators e u i are essentially given by e u i h u i h x y e i 1 x 2 y 3 x y dx dy i 1 2 since u 1 1 and u 2 1 by ho lder s inequality this implies that e u 1 f e u 2 g p cp q f q g q by undoing the change of coordinates and using 2 35 this leads to the estimates eu 1 f eu 2 g p cp q 3 1 2 1 1 p 1 q f q g q assume next that 1 10 then lemma 2 4 shows that u 1 0 2 and u 2 x y 0 y b 1 0 x y 2 1 a where x y x y thus in this situation we may reduce to the prototype situation studied in theorem 3 3 by means of a change of coordinates of the form x y c 20 x c 0 y and thus obtain the estimate e u 1 f e u 2 g p cp 7 2 6 p f 2 g 2 since here u 1 2 and u 2 ho lder s inequality then implies that e u 1 f e u 2 g p cp q 3 1 2 1 q 7 2 6 p f q g q cp q 5 3 q 6 p f q g q by undoing the change of coordinates we again pick up an extra factor 3 1 2 1 1 p 1 q 6 1 1 p 1 q and arrive at the claimed estimate for the case 1 10 3 1 the bilinear argument proof of theorem 3 3 as the bilinear method is by now standard we will only give a brief sketch of the proof of theorem 3 3 pointing out the necessary modifications compared to the classical case of elliptic surfaces first recall from subsection 2 4 that we had passed from our original coordinates x y to the coordinates x y by means of the scaling transformation x y a x y x y and had put s z az a with a deta we are going to establish the following bilinear fourier extension estimate for the scaled patches of surface ssi which where defined as the graphs of s over the sets u si i 1 2 eus 1 f 1 eu s 2 f 2 p cp 5 2 4 p f 1 2 f 2 2 3 2 for every f 1 l 2 u s 1 and every f 2 l 2 u s 2 here eusi fi denotes the fourier transform of fid i where i is the pull back of the lebesgue measure on u s i to the surface s s i by means of the projection onto the x y plane i e eus i fi f id i us i fi z e i z s z dz scaling back to our original coordinates we obtain from this estimate that eu 1 f 1 eu 2 f 2 p deta 1 1 p a 1 p 5 2 4 p f 1 2 f 2 2 7 2 6 p f 1 2 f 2 2 hence 3 1 20 s buschenhenke d mu ller and a vargas we start by recalling that a first important step in the bilinear argument consists in a wave packet decomposition of the functions f id i compare e g l 05 for details on wave packet decompositions for the construction of the wave packets at scale r in the bilinear argument one first decomposes the functions fi into well localized modulated bump functions at scale 1 r localized near points v say v z r z v and then considers their fourier extensions vd here denotes any of the measures i then by means of a taylor expansion one finds that essentially vd rz e i v z s v z dz r 2 e i v z e i r 1 z s v r 1 z dz r 2 e i v s v z e i r 1 s v z 1 2 r 2 z th s v z dz where v is on the line segment between v and v r 1 z following l 05 lemma 2 3 integra tion by parts shows that the wave packet is then associated to the region where the complete phase satisfies r 1 z s v r 1 z c for every z with z 1 say with c small on which vd is essentially constant this condition requires in particular that the usual condition s v r holds true recall here also from 2 30 that for v u s 1 u s 2 we have s v 1 moreover if we assume that v x v y v u s 1 then y v c 0 so that if r 1 by 2 29 h s v 1 hence we obtain the usual condition r 2 note also that the higher order derivatives of the phase r 1 z s v r 1 z are bounded by constants this means that the wave packets associated to f 1 and the patch of hypersurface s s 1 are essentially supported in tubes t 1 of the form t 1 s v r r 2 respectively horizontal translates in of them due to modulations notice the standard fact that t 1 is a tube of dimension r r r 2 whose long axis is pointing in the direction of the normal vector n v s v 1 to ss 1 at the point v s v however if v x v y v u s 2 then y v 1 so that by 2 29 if r 1 h s v 1 to bound r 2 z th v z 1 we thus here need to assume that r 2 and the wave packets associated to f 2 and patch of hypersurface s s 2 are thus essentially supported in shorter tubes t 2 of the form t 2 s v r r 2 respectively horizontal translates in of them the wave packets associated to such tubes will be denoted by ti i 1 2 there is a technical obstacle here to be noticed which is of a similar nature as a related problem that had arisen in bmv 16 to ensure that the wave packets are tubes we need that r 2 r i e r 1 for the usual induction on scales argument this creates the difficulty that we cannot simply induct in the standard way on the scales r 1 instead we change variables r r and induct on the scales r 1 the wave packets t 2 are of then of dimension r r r 2 where now indeed r 2 r a fourier restriction theorem for a perturbed hyperbolic paraboloid 21 following further on the bilinear method we have to consider localized estimates at scale r of the form eu 1 f 1 eu 2 f 2 lp q r c c r f 1 2 f 2 2 3 3 where q r is a cuboid determined by the wave packets and need to push down the exponent by means of induction on scales wave packet decompositions then allow to reduce these estimates to bilinear estimates for the associated wave packets the corresponding l 1 estimate is trivial compare l 05 or bmv 16 for details since the wave packets of a given type arising in these decompositions are almost orthogonal one easily finds by cauchy schwarz inequality that t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 1 t 1 t 1 2 t 2 t 2 2 r 2 2 t 1 1 2 r 2 t 2 1 2 3 2 r 2 t 1 t 2 1 2 3 4 as for further lp estimates grossly oversimplifying the bilinear method allows to devise some bad subset of q r whose contributions are simply controlled by means of the induction on scales hypothesis and a good subset on which we can obtain a strong l 2 estimate by means of sophisticated geometric combinatorial considerations essentially of the form without going into details t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 2 r 1 2 t 1 t 2 1 2 1 2 r 1 2 t 1 t 2 1 2 3 5 for 1 p 2 interpolation between these estimates in 3 4 and 3 5 gives t 1

bilinear estimate 3 2 holds true in this very rough description of the bilinear approach in our setting we have suppressed a number of subtle and important issues which we shall explain next in some more detail indeed the proof of the crucial l 2 estimate 3 5 requires more careful considerations for the combinatorial argument to work we not only need the lower bounds on the transversalities given by lemma 2 3 but also have to make sure that the tubes ti of a given type on which the wave packets are essentially supported are separated as the base point varies along the intersection curves at distances of order 1 r let us explain this in more detail we take a collection of 1 r separated points along the projection onto the z x y plane of an intersection curve s z 1 z 2 associated to the patches of surface ss 1 and s s 2 for each point z of this collection we consider the point z 1 z z 2 u s 1 we fix another point p 0 r 3 and consider all the tubes t 1 which are associated to such base points z 1 and which pass through the given point p 0 what the geometric combinatorial argument then requires is that the directions of these tubes be separated so that the tubes t 1 b p 0 r 2 2 c have bounded overlap see v 05 l 05 bmv 16 22 s buschenhenke d mu ller and a vargas given the dimensions of the tubes t 1 of type 1 it is clear that this kind of separation is achieved if the directions of the normals to the re scaled surface ss at those points z 1 s z 1 are r r 2 1 r separated similarly given the dimensions of the tubes t 2 of type 2 we shall also need that the directions of the normals to the surface at the points z 2 z 2 for z 2 z z 1 arer r 2 1 1 r separated the sizes of the entry 2 s y 2 of the hessian of s in 2 29 at the points of u s 1 respectively u s 2 and the fact that the tangents to the curve are essentially diagonal compare 2 31 guaranty that the desired separation condition is indeed satisfied another obstacle which again already arose in bmv 16 consists in setting up the base case for the induction on scales argument i e setting up a suitable estimate of the form 3 3 for some initial possibly very large value of the exponent in the classical setting of elliptic surfaces the na f and easily established estimate of the form eu 1 f 1 eu 2 f 2 lp q r q r 1 p f 1 1 f 2 1 would work but in our setting this would not give the right power of needed to establish 3 3 we therefore follow our approach in bmv 16 compare lemma 2 10 2 11 which provides us with the following a priori l 2 estimate not relying on the afore mentioned geometric argument t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 2 r 1 2 sup i 1 2 sup t i 1 2 t 1 t 2 1 2 where t i denotes the set of all tubes of type i associated to base points along a given intersection curve of translates of ss 1 and s s 2 we are done if we can show that t i is bounded by some power of r but independently of we already saw in 2 31 that the tangent of the intersection curve is essentially diagonal after scaling u s 2 is a set of dimensions 1 1 but u s 1 is a rectangle of dimensions 1 so an essentially diagonal intersection curve can have length at most o since the separation of the base points of our wave packets along this curve is of size 1 r r we see that indeed we must have t i cr this completes our sketch of proof of theorem 3 3 after distributing our preprint though the arxiv we learned from timothy candy that the bilinear estimate in theorem 3 3 could also be deduced from his more general bilinear estimates in theorem 1 4 of can 17 after applying the crucial scaling in x that we use in subsection 2 4 the convexity assumptions on the sets j in his theorem is not really necessary as he pointed out to us we wish to thank him for informing us about this 4 the whitney type decomposition and its overlap 4 1 the whitney type decomposition of v 1 v 2 let v 1 v 2 be an admissible pair of strips as defined in subsection 2 2 recall the definition of admissible pairs of sets from the same subsection and that we had also introduced there the sets p respectively p of admissible pairs of type 1 respectively type 2 at scale and by p respectively p we had denoted the corresponding unions over all dyadic scales a fourier restriction theorem for a perturbed hyperbolic paraboloid 23 lemma 4 1 the following covering and overlapping properties hold true i for fixed dyadic scale the subsets u 1 u 2 u 1 u 2 p of v 1 v 2 q q are pairwise disjoint as likewise are the subsets u 1 u 2 u 1 u 2 p ii if and are dyadic scales and if u 1 u 2 p and u 1 u 2 p then the sets u 1 u 2 and u 1 u 2 can only intersect if 27 1 in the latter case there is only bounded overlap i e there is a constant m 26 such that for every u 1 u 2 p there are at most m pairs u 1 u 2 p such that u 1 u 2 u 1 u 2 6 and vice versa the analogous statements apply to admissible pairs in p iii if u 1 u 2 p and u 1 u 2 p then u 1 u 2 and u 1 u 2 are disjoint too except possibly when both 1 800 and 210 in the latter case there is only bounded overlap i e there is a constant n o c 0 such that for every u 1 u 2 p there are at most n pairs u 1 u 2 p such that u 1 u 2 u 1 u 2 6 and vice versa iv the product sets associated to all admissible pairs cover v 1 v 2 up to a set of measure 0 i e v 1 v 2 u 1 u 2 p u 1 u 2 u 1 u 2 p u 1 u 2 in measure proof i let u 1 u 2 u 1 u 2 p be different admissible pairs of type 1 at scale then we shall see that already the sets u 1 and u 1 will be disjoint indeed this will obviously be true if the corresponding points y 01 are different for u 1 and u 1 and if they do agree then this will be true because of different values of x 01 ii the first statement follows immediately from lemma 2 1 to prove the second one assume that 27 1 and that u 1 u x 01 y 0 1 1 u 1 u x 01 y 01 1 recall that u 1 u x 01 y 0 1 1 is essentially a rectangular box of dimension 2 1 containing the point x 01 y 0 1 whose longer side has slope y 01 with respect to the y axis and an analogous statement is true of u 1 if u 1 u 1 6 then we must have y 0 1 y 01 1 and so the slopes for these two boxes can only differ of size at 1 which implies that both boxes must be essentially of the same direction and dimension this easily implies the claimed overlapping properties because of the separation properties of the points in i 1 and i iii if either 1 800 or 1 800 or if 210 then lemma 2 1 and lemma 2 2 show that u 1 u 2 and u 1 u 2 must be disjoint in the remaining case where both 1 800 and 210 assume that u 1 u x 01 y 0 1 1 and u 1 u x 0 y 02 1 are so that u 1 u 1 6 then observe that both u 1 and u 1 are essentially rectangular boxes of dimension 2 where u 1 has slope y 0 1 with respect to the y axis and u 1 has slope y 0 2 with respect to the y axis since y 01 y 0 2 c 0 c 0 this shows that u 1 must be contained within a rectangular box of dimension c 0 2 around u 1 so that there are at most o c 0 sets u 1 of this type which can intersect u 1 iv let z 1 z 2 v 1 v 2 without loss of generality we may assume by symmetry that z 1 z 1 z 2 z 2 z 1 z 2 i e that x 2 x 1 y 2 y 2 y 1 x 2 x 1 y 1 y 2 y 1 24 s buschenhenke d mu ller and a vargas we shall then show that there is an admissible pair u 1 u 2 p such that z 1 z 2 u 1 u 2 in the other case we would accordingly find an admissible pair of type 2 with this property we shall also assume that z 1 z 1 z 2 0 since the set of pairs z 1 z 2 with z 1 z 1 z 2 0 forms a set of measure 0 then there is a unique dyadic 0 2 such that c 20 2 z 1 z 1 z 2 2 c 2 0 2 chose y 01 i 1 such that 0 y 1 y 0 1 1 and then x 0 1 t 0 2 i such that 0 x 1 x 0 1 y 0 1 y 1 y 0 1 2 and 0 x 2 t 0 2 y 2 y 2 y 0 1 2 define as in 2 13 z 01 x 0 1 y 0 1 and z 0 2 t 0 2 y 0 2 y 0 2 y 0 1 y 0 2 we observe that as in the proof of lemma 2 1 these estimates imply that the estimates 2 18 and 2 19 remain valid in particular we immediately see that z 01 z 01 z 0 2 4 c 2 0 2 so that 2 15 is satisfied as for condition 2 16 if 8 by means of 2 2 and 2 11 we can estimate z 02 z 01 z 0 2 z 01 z 01 z 0 2 c 2 0 2 c 20 2 4 1 c 20 2 1 8 on the other hand if 1 32 then we may estimate z 02 z 01 z 0 2 c 2 0 2 4 z 01 z 01 z 0 2 c 2 0 2 1 4 4 c 20 2 1 8 what remains is the case where 1 32 8 here we use the estimate z 2 z 1 z 2 z 1 z 1 z 2 c 2 0 2 c 20 2 32 which by 2 19 implies z 02 z 01 z 0 2 c 2 0 2 32 6 c 0 2 1 c 20 2 32 48 c 0 2 c 20 2 64 c 20 2 1 512 if we choose c 0 sufficiently large moreover note that we always have z 02 z 01 z 0 2 z 01 z 01 z 0 2 c 2 0 2 5 c 20 2 1 thus we have also verified 2 16 hence u x 01 y 0 1 1 u t 02 y 0 1 y 0 2 2 is an admissible pair of type 1 at scale 4 2 handling the overlap in the whitney type decomposition of v 1 v 2 for r 0 9 we define the subset pr j p 210 j r of p to these subsets of admissible pairs we associate the subsets ar u 1 u 2 pr u 1 u 2 a r u 1 u 2 p r u 1 u 2 r 0 9 4 1 of v 1 v 2 then lemma 4 1 shows the following i the unions in 4 1 are disjoint unions of the sets u 1 u 2 respectively u 1 u 2 ii there is a fixed number n 1 such that the following hold true for given r 6 r and u 1 u 2 pr there are at most n admissible pairs u 1 u 2 pr such that u 1 u 2 u 1 u 2 6 and vice versa similarly for given r r and u 1 u 2 pr there are at most n admissible pairs u 1 u 2 p r such that u 1 u 2 u 1 u 2 6 and vice versa a fourier restriction theorem for a perturbed hyperbolic paraboloid 25 iii v 1 v 2 9 r 0 ar a r we shall make use of the following identity which follows easily by induction on m if b 1 bm are subsets of a given set x then b 1 bm 6 j 1 m 1 j 1 j j bj applying this to iii we find that v 1 v 2 6 j j 0 9 1 j j 1 r j ar r j a r 4 2 this will allow to reduce our considerations to finite intersections of the set ar and a r indeed let us define e f q q f z z e i z z z z z z dzdz for any integrable function f on q q so that in particular e f g e f e g then by 4 2 if f is supported in v 1 and g in v 2 e f e g 6 j j 0 9 1 j j 1 e f g r j ar r j a r 4 3 we may thus reduce considerations to restrictions of f g to any of the intersection sets in 4 3 so let us fix non empty subsets j j 0 9 and put b r j ar r j a r we then choose r 0 j and note that b ar 0 where ar 0 is the disjoint union of the product sets u 1 u 2 over all admissible pairs u 1 u 2 pr 0 so that b u 1 u 2 pr 0 b u 1 u 2 and by i ii each intersection b u 1 u 2 is the finite disjoint union b u 1 u 2 1 2 u 1 u 2 pr 0 of at most n j j measurable product subsets 1 2 u 1 u 2 since we shall have to estimate the lp norm of e f g b later note that e f g b u 1 u 2 e f 1 e g 2 thus if we write our estimates in corollary 3 1 in the form eu 1 f eu 2 g p cp q u 1 u 2 f q g q since i ui we see that also e f 1 e g 2 p cp q u 1 u 2 f u 1 q g u 2 q 26 s buschenhenke d mu ller and a vargas hence for every u 1 u 2 pr 0 e f g b u 1 u 2 p n j j cp q u 1 u 2 f u 1 q g u 2 q this shows that on the set b we essentially get the same estimates for the contributions by subsets u 1 u 2 that we get on ar 0 this will allow us to reduce our considerations in the next section to the sets ar respectively a r which are already disjoint unions of product set u 1 u 2 associated to admissible pairs observe finally that for given r f g ar u 1 u 2 pr f u 1 f u 2 4 4 5 passage to linear restriction estimates and proof of theorem 1 1 to prove theorem 1 1 assume that r 10 3 and 1 q 2 r and put p r 2 so that p 5 3 1 q 1 p by interpolation with the trivial estimate for r q 1 it is enough to prove the result for r close to 10 3 and q close to 5 2 i e p close to 5 3 and q close to 5 2 hence we may assume that p 2 p q 2 p also we can assume that supp f x y q y 0 we prove the linear estimates in two steps following our steps in the construction in subsection 2 1 in a first step we fix a scale and shall prove uniform bilinear fourier extension estimates for admissible pairs v 1 v 2 of strips at scale as defined in 2 10 of subsection 2 1 our goal will be to prove the following lemma 5 1 if v 1 v 2 form an admissible pair of strips vi vji iji 1 1 i 1 2 at scale within q and if f lq v 1 and g l q v 2 then for the range of p s and q s described above we have ev 1 f ev 2 g p cp q 2 1 1 p 1 q f q g q for all f l q v 1 g l q v 2 5 1 we remark that eventually we shall choose f g but for the arguments to follow it is helpful to distinguish between f and g proof to begin with observe that by means of an affine linear transformation of the form 2 33 we may move the strips v 1 v 2 vertically so that j 1 0 which means that v 1 contains the origin also by 2 8 c 0 8 j 2 c 0 2 this we shall assume throughout the proof we recall from the previous section that it is essentially sufficient to consider e f g ar in place of ev 1 f ev 2 g and similarly for a r in place of ar but then 4 4 shows that we may decompose f g ar i i j f i j g i j where f i j f u i 2 j 1 1 g i j g u i 2 j 1 j 2 2 and where each u i 2 j 1 1 u i 2 j 1 j 2 2 forms an admissible pair i e 2 15 2 16 are satisfied this means in particular by 2 15 that i i c 20 the a fourier restriction theorem for a perturbed hyperbolic paraboloid 27 summation in is here meant as summation over all dyadic such that 2 we may and shall also assume that f and g are supported on the set y 0 then e f g ar 1 10 i i f i d g i d 1 10 i i j f i jd g i j d 5 2 the first sum which collects all straight box terms can be treated by more classical arguments compare e g l 05 or v 05 which in view of the first estimate in theorem 3 1 then leads to a bound for the contribution of that sum to ev 1 f ev 2 g p in 5 1 of the order 1 2 1 cp q 3 2 1 1 p 1 q f q g q 2 1 1 p 1 q f q g q as required we leave the details to the interested reader we shall therefore concentrate on the second sum in 5 2 which collects all curved box terms in which the admissibility conditions reduce to i i c 20 let us then fix 1 10 and simplify notation by writing fi j f i j gi j g i j and u 1 i j u i 2 j 1 1 u 2 i j u i 2 j 1 j 2 2 as a first step in proving estimate 5 1 we exploit some almost orthogonality with respect to the x coordinate lemma 5 2 for 1 p 2 we have j i i i c 20 f i jd g i jd p p 2 n 0 i n 1 n 1 1 i i c 2 0 j f i jd g i jd p p 5 3 proof of lemma 5 2 assume that i n 1 n 1 1 and that z 1 x 1 y 1 u 1 i j and z 2 x 2 y 2 u 2 i j where i i c 20 so that u 1 i j u 2 i j p is an admissible pair then by lemma 4 1 a we have x 2 x 1 y 2 y 2 y 1 8 c 2 0 2 where y 2 y 2 y 1 c 0 c 0 by 2 11 so that we may assume that x 2 x 1 9 c 2 0 2 this implies that x 1 x 2 2 x 1 o 2 and thus x 1 x 2 2 n 2 o 2 where the constant in the error term is of order c 20 hence u 1 i j u 2 i j 2 n 2 10 c 20 2 2 n 2 10 c 20 2 0 2 c 0 notice that the family of intervals 2 n 2 10 c 20 2 2 n 2 10 c 20 2 2 n 0 is almost pairwise disjoint therefore we may argue as in the proof of lemma 6 1 in tvv 98 in order to derive the desired estimate for our next step recall that u 1 i j is essentially a rectangular box of dimension 2 and u 2 i j is a thin curved box of width 2 and length contained in a rectangle of dimension 2 whose axes are parallel to the coordinate axes notice also that if 1 then u 1 i j is essentially a square of size whereas u 2 i j is a thin curved box of width and length 1 in this special case it will be useful to further decompose u 2 i j into squares of size analogously since we may pass from the case 1 to the case of general in our definition of admissible pairs by means of the dilations d x y 2 x y for arbitrary 28 s buschenhenke d mu ller and a vargas we decompose u 2 i j in the y coordinate into intervals of length by putting u k 2 i j x y u 2 i j 0 y k then u 2 i j k uk 2 i j where the union is over a set of o 1 indices k accordingly we decompose gi j k g k i j where gki j g uk 2 i j then we have the following uniform square function estimate lemma 5 3 for 1 p 2 there exists a constant cp 0 such that for every n 0 2 we have i n 1 n 1 1 i i c 2 0 j f i jd g i jd p cp i n 1 n 1 1 i i c 2 0 j k f i jd g k i j d 2 1 2 p 5 4 proof of lemma 5 3 notice first that a translation in x by n 2 allows to reduce to the case n 0 which we shall thus assume then the relevant sets u 1 i j and u 2 i j will all have their x coordinates in the interval 0 2 for i i j k as above set s 1 i j u 1 i j s k 2 i j u k 2 i j the key to the square function estimate 5 4 is the following almost orthogonality lemma lemma 5 4 assume n 0 and denote by d 0 the dilations on r 3 given by d x y z 2 x y 3 z then there is a family of cubes qki i j i 0 1 i i c 0 j k in r 3 with bounded overlap whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes and of length such that s 1 i j s k 2 i j d q k i i j proof of lemma 5 4 recalling the parabolic scalings d x y 2 x y under which the phase is homogeneous of degree 3 we may apply the scaling by d 1 in r 3 order to reduce our considerations to the case 1 then as we have already seen s 1 i j and s k 2 i j are contained in boxes of side length say 2 and sides parallel to the axes whose projections to the x axis lie within the unit interval 0 1 therefore we can choose for qki i j a square of of side length 4 with sides parallel to the axes with the property that s 1 i j s k 2 i j q k i i j we need to prove that the overlap is bounded note that if x 1 y 1 u 1 i j and x 2 y 2 u k 2 i j with i i c 20 then by lemma 2 1 since 1 we have x 2 x 1 y 2 y 2 y 1 z 1 z 1 z 2 c 2 0 a fourier restriction theorem for a perturbed hyperbolic paraboloid 29 it suffices to prove the following if x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 and x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 are so that each coordinate of these points is bounded by a large multiple of c 0 the y coordinates are positive and satisfy y 2 y 1 c 0 by the y separation 2 11 and x 2 x 1 y 2 y 2 y 1 c 2 0 x 2 x 1 y 2 y 2 y 1 c 2 0 x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 o y 1 y 2 y 1 y 2 o x 1 y 1 y 31

quantities defined by x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 are denoted by t 1 and t 2 notice that by our assumptions a and b only vary of order o if we replace x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 by x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 then t 1 t 2 2 x 1 y 1 bx 1 ay 1 ab b 3 3 b 2 y 1 by 2 1 we choose c with c c 20 such that x 2 x 1 y 2 y 2 y 1 c then we may re write x 1 a c b y 1 b 2 y 1 2 therefore t 1 t 2 c a b bc 2 y 1 c 3 2 b 2 3 by 21 2 y 3 1 c a b o y 1 where c a b is a polynomial in a b and where we have put y 3 2 b 2 y 3 by 2 2 y 3 similarly t 1 t 2 c a b o y 1 and thus since a a o b b o hence c a b c a b o we have y 1 y 1 o we may assume without loss of generality that y 2 y 1 0 the other case can be treated in a similar way then because of the y separation 2 11 we have y 2 y 1 c 0 and y 1 0 and b y 2 y 1 so that y 1 b 1 2 and b 1 it is a calculus exercise to prove that in this situation for y b 1 2 we have y 3 2 this shows that we must have y 1 y 1 o hence also y 2 y 2 o and then our first two assumptions imply also the remaining assertions in 5 5 this finishes the proof of the almost orthogonality lemma 5 4 to complete the proof of lemma 5 3 define the linear operators t k i i j h d q k i i j h and s h t ki i jh i 0 1 i i c

observe that the exponent in our dyadic parameter is 5 2 q 7 p 3 2 q 7 p 3 5 p 0 so that we can sum in 4 4 over all dyadic scales 1 and arrive at the estimate 5 1 note that up to this point we have been working with a fixed admissible pair if strips v 1 v 2 in which all functions where supported in a final step we shall prove the linear fourier extension estimate of theorem 1 1 by summing over
