inequalities for the fourier restriction operator associated to rectangular pieces of the paraboloid and perturbations thereof we state a conjecture for the dependence of the operator norms in these inequalities on the sidelengths of the rectangles prove that this conjecture follows from a slight reformulation of the restriction conjecture for elliptic hypersurfaces and prove that if valid the conjecture is essentially sharp such questions arise naturally in the study of restriction inequalities for degenerate hypersurfaces we demonstrate this connection by using our positive results to prove new restriction inequalities for a class of hypersurfaces having some additive structure 1 introduction recent work 2 establishing bounds for restriction operators associated to higher order surfaces on which the curvature may vanish at some points naturally gives rise to the study of the restriction operator r d associated to the rectangular piece of the paraboloid 2 q q d j 1 lj lj l 1 ld 0 d and perturbations thereof in this article we consider the problems of establishing finiteness and under standing the dependence on of the lp lq operator norms of r d we then apply such results to obtain new sharp restriction inequalities for a collection of degenerate hypersurfaces i e hypersurfaces whose curvature vanishes on some nonempty set we are motivated by the recent success of the first author 13 cf 4 in directly deducing sharp estimates for model convolution operators by using a generalization of this approach the natural interpretation of ellipticity in this context leads to a slight general ization of the traditional notion of ellipticity formulated by tao vargas vega 15 we introduce some additional notation letting a 1 d l 1 1 ld d 0 d and 1 1 1 definition 1 1 let 0 d and let g be a cn 2 loc function on q for some 0 d with n 0 sufficiently large possibly infinite assume that d 2 g is positive definite throughout q and let 0 0 12 we say that g is elliptic over q with parameters n 0 if g 2 h where the perturbation h satisfies 1 http arxiv org abs 1911 11600 v 1 2 jeremy schwend and betsy stovall h 0 0 h 0 0 d 2 h 0 0 and d 2 h a cn q 1 0 for every bounded q contained in q if g is elliptic over q with parameters n 0 we will also say that the surface g g q is elliptic over q with parameters n 0 this definition of ellipticity is invariant under parabolic rescalings in the sense that g is elliptic over q if and only if 2 g 1 is elliptic over q in the special cases that d 1 or 1 1 1 our definition of ellipticity coincides with that in 15 but ours is strictly more general in the sense that a surface elliptic over some q may not be coverable by a bounded independent of number of surfaces elliptic in the sense of 15 we will see the utility of this generalization once we turn to applications associated to a function g elliptic over some q are the familiar restriction and extension operators r gf f g q e gf t x q ei t x g f d t x r 1 d since these operators are dual to one another it suffices to state our results for the extension operator though ellipticity over some q is a more general concept than ellipticity in the sense of tao vargas vega the evidence toward the following conjecture seems as strong as that for the corresponding conjecture for elliptic hypersurfaces conjecture 1 2 for n sufficiently large 0 0 sufficiently large and 1 p q in the range q d 2 d p p there exists a constant cp q d such that for any 0 d e g lp lq cp q d for any g elliptic over q with parameters n 0 this conjecture is already verified in the case d 1 by fefferman stein 6 and zygmund 18 to the authors read it seems likely that all recent results including 10 11 12 17 establishing bounds for hypersurfaces elliptic in the sense of 15 would generalize to imply progress toward conjecture 1 2 but here we claim results only in the bilinear range wherein they are straight forward to deduce from results already in the literature 3 we will detail the deduction from the results of 3 in section 4 theorem 1 3 3 6 14 15 18 conjecture 1 2 holds for all d 1 and q 2 d 3 d 1 as promised we turn now to the dependence of operator norms on the side lengths conjecture 1 4 let 0 d satisfy l 1 ld for g elliptic over q with parameters n sufficiently large and 0 0 sufficiently small depending on d p q we have the following operator norm bounds for e lg with implicit constants independent of g and if q p satisfy q d j 2 d j p for some 0 j d and 0 1 then e g lp lq l 1 lj l j 1 1 p 1 q 1 1 fourier restriction above rectangles 3 in particular this quantity is finite whenever lj 1 if ld we have in addition e g lp lq l 1 ld 1 q 1 p ld lj 1 l 1 lj l j 1 1 2 q 1 2 for q 2 d j 1 d j p 0 1 0 and j 0 d 2 and e g lp lq l 1 ld 1 1 p 1 q l 1 3 q 1 p d 1 3 for q 4 and p q 3 modulo the precise definition of ellipticity the two dimensional version of this conjecture was essentially formulated by buschenhenke mu ller vargas in 2 one must rescale we have the following positive result theorem 1 5 conjecture 1 2 implies conjecture 1 4 in particular conjec ture 1 4 holds in the regions q 10 3 and also when d 3 for 1 p 1 q lying in the convex hulls of any of the following pairs of half open line segments 1 0 k 2 3 k 2 2 k k 3 k 1 2 k 3 and 1 0 k 1 2 3 k 1 2 2 k 1 k 4 k 2 2 k 4 2 k d 1 more precise statements of the conditionality may be found in the lemmas leading to the proof of theorem 1 5 in addition we prove that conjecture 1 4 if true is essentially optimal excepting the precise asymptotics as ld lj 1 in the region q p q 4 theorem 1 6 let 0 d satisfy l 1 ld let g be elliptic over q with parameters n 2 and 0 0 1 then e lg does not extend as a bounded linear operator for p q lying outside of the region q d 2 d p q 2 d 1 d if lk some 1 k d then e lg does not extend as a bounded operator from lp to lq for any p q nor q d k 3 d k 1 p more precisely if q p satisfy q d j 2 d j p for some 0 j d and 0 1 then e g lp lq l 1 lj l j 1 1 p 1 q 1 4 if q 2 d j 1 d j p 0 1 and j 0 d 2 then e g lp lq l 1 ld 1 q 1 p ld lj 1 l 1 ljl j 1 1 2 q 1 5 here depends on d p and q 1 and r as r finally for q 4 and p q 3 e g lp lq l 1 ld 1 1 p 1 q l 1 3 q 1 p d 1 6 correct attribution for the statement of conjecture 1 4 and prior progress toward theorems 1 5 and 1 6 in the literature is somewhat ambiguous particularly as some prior progress on these questions was not formalized into precisely stated theorems the hypotheses and generality elsewhere differ and the implications of earlier methods and results seem not to have been fully exploited we give a recounting of the progress of which we are aware for the fully conditional part of theorem 1 5 we use an elementary deduction which was used to obtain an alternate proof of the restriction inequality for the cone in 5 in two dimensions under a more restrictive hypothesis lower bounds matching those from theorem 1 6 4 jeremy schwend and betsy stovall in the region 2 p q 3 p p q were obtained as were the lower bounds in the region 3 q 4 modulo the additional gain in ld lj 1 it was also remarked that the methods in 9 which in turn attributes the method to 5 lead to the conditional result in this region nevertheless the question seems not to have been formulated in this level of generality particularly with regard to dimension some of our lower bounds seem to be new in all dimensions and some of our positive results in the bilinear range are obtained by means that also seem to be new in this context two natural open questions are whether for particular values of there is a larger range of exponents for which unconditional progress toward theorem 1 5 can be made and whether unconditional results could be extended along horizontal lines in greater generality than just the bilinear range in two dimensions the analogues of theorems 1 5 and 1 6 are obtained for the analogous convolu tion operators in an unpublished manuscript of the first author our main application is to determine new inequalities and give a simpler proof of known inequalities for a class of degenerate hypersurfaces given 1 d we define an extension operator e f t x q 1 ei t x g f d g d j 1 j j in the case d 2 this extension operator was considered in 9 in the stein tomas range and in 2 in the bilinear range varchenko s height 16 associated to these surfaces is the quantity h defined by 1 h 1 1 1 d in determining bounds for e intermediate dimensional versions of the height be come relevant thus taking the convention that 1 2 d we also define jn 1 1 1 n 0 n d we obtain an essentially optimal conditional result for the operators e to facilitate its statement we let td denote the set of all p q 1 2 for which the local elliptic extension operator is conjectured to be bounded that is td p q 1 2 q 2 d 1 d q d 2 d p 1 7 theorem 1 7 assume that conjecture 1 4 holds for all p q in a relatively open subset v td containing p q then e extends as a bounded operator from lp to lq if at least one of the following conditions hold i q p and q p 1 1 jn d n 2 for all 0 n d ii q p and 1 jn d n q jn p d n 2 for all 0 n d or iii q p 1 jd q jd p and 1 jn d n q jn p d n 2 for all 0 n d furthermore e is of restricted weak type p q if iv q p 1 jd q jd p and 1 jn d n q jn p d n 2 for all 0 n d here we use the not completely standard definition that a linear operator t initially defined on l 1 rd is of restricted weak type p q if tfe gf e 1 p f 1 q for all measurable finite measure e f and measurable functions fe e and gf f it will be convenient to note that we may equivalently replace fourier restriction above rectangles 5 by in the conditions on fe gf for finite p this is equivalent to the usual definition of restricted weak type boundedness conditional on the restriction conjecture above rectangles both the strong and restricted weak type estimates arising in theorem 1 7 are sharp proposition 1 8 if p q 1 2 does not satisfy any of conditions i iii of theorem 1 7 then e is not of strong type p q if p q 1 2 does not satisfy any of conditions i iv of theorem 1 7 then e is not of restricted weak type p q when d 2 proposition 1 8 is due to 2 and theorem 1 7 is due to 2 in the bilinear range where it is unconditional and to 9 in the stein tomas range for d 2 theorem 1 7 is due to 8 in the stein tomas range our main new contribution is a direct deduction of the result from conjecture 1 2 which leads to a simpler approach that avoids the complicated step of obtaining bilinear restriction estimates between rectangles at different scales this simplification enables us to address the higher dimensional case as well as the case when some exponents i are less than 2 the region 1 p 1 q described in theorem 1 7 and proposition 1 8 can be somewhat difficult to visualize so we make a few simple observations we see the familiar conditions q d 2 d p and q 2 d 1 d in the n 0 case of each of the constraints the lower bound on q p in i of theorem 1 7 is strongest when jn d n 2 is minimal which occurs when n n 0 the minimal index for which i 2 for all i n 0 thus the constraint in i is strictly stronger than that in the elliptic restriction conjecture unless n 0 0 i e i 2 for all i the condition ii may introduce some vertices in the riesz diagram these all lie on or above the line 1 q 1 p for each n the lines q p 1 1 jn d n 2 seen in i and 1 jn d n q jn p d n 2 seen in ii intersect when q p 2 1 jn d n 2 and these two lines are equal when n d the slope of the line 1 jn d n q jn p d n 2 is jn 1 1 d n jn which equals 0 when n 0 and decreases as n increases the intersection point of such a line with q p is q p 2 1 jn d n 2 which moves closer to 0 0 as n increases until n reaches n 0 at which point it begins to increase thus only those lines with n n 0 play a role in determining the boundary of the region notation admissible constants may depend on the dimension d the exponents p q and the d tuple in the definition of e as well as any operator norms on whose finiteness results may be conditioned for nonnegative real numbers a b we will use the notation a b b a to mean that a cb for an admissible constant c which is allowed to change from line to line a b means a b and b a we will occasionally subscript constants or the notation to indicate dependence on an additional parameter for r denotes the positive part max

elliptic surfaces in this section we will prove a handful of technical lemmas that are useful in developing the restriction theory of hypersurfaces elliptic over a rectangle the proofs use only basic calculus the statements of the results will be simpler if we generalize the notion of ellip ticity definition 2 1 let k be a convex subset of rd with nonempty interior and let g cn 2 loc k with d 2 g

case 0 2 2 follows from the 1 case d 2 g 0 2 id and the fundamental theorem of calculus fourier restriction above rectangles 7 2 2 slicing here we will show that the restriction of a function elliptic over a rec tangle to some lower dimensional slice of the rectangle is also elliptic with compa rable parameters this result is essential in the conditional proof of theorem 1 5 lemma 2 3 let 0 d and let g be elliptic over q with parameters n 0 let p rd be an affine k plane and assume that p q has nonempty interior in p let 0 p q and let u 1 uk be an orthonormal basis for p 0 then g 1 k g 0 k j 1

follows readily by adapting standard undergraduate level proofs of the morse lemma to functions elliptic over rectangles we omit the details of this elemen tary adaptation this result allows us to invoke the classical arguments involving stationary phase including the stein tomas and strichartz theorems lemma 2 4 let g be elliptic over q 0 d with parameters n 1 and 0 d then exist u rd and a cn

sets e f with positive finite mea sures and measurable functions fe e gf f proposition 3 1 the conclusions of theorem 1 6 hold with e g rwtlp lq in place of e g lp lq the rest of this section will be devoted to the proof of proposition 3 1 we will use the convention that references to equations in the statement of theorem 1 6 shall be superscripted with rwt that e g rwtlp lq is infinite whenever q d 2 d p follows from the classical knapp example the case when q 2 d 1 d follows from a slight modification of the argument from 1 which will be given in lemma 3 4 the assertion regarding unboundedness of e g when some lj are infinite follows from the lower bounds 1 4 1 6 and the elemenary inequality e g rwtlq lp e g rwtlq lp for l j lj j 1 d 3 1 it remains to prove the lower bounds in the case that each lj is finite this will be carried out in three lemmas one for each numbered inequality lemma 3 2 the lower bound 1 4 from theorem 1 6 is valid in the range q p proof the argument is an elementary generalization of the knapp example let j 0 d 1 0 1 and assume that q p satisfy q d j 2 d j p let be a smooth nonnegative function with supp q 1 and 1 set j 1 l 1 j lj j 1 lj 1 d lj 1

by adapting the kakeya like argument of 1 let n 1 assume that ld lj 1 n 3 by parabolic rescaling we may assume that lj 1 1 n we cover at least half of q by pairwise disjoint rectangles r r congruent to q l 1 lj 1 n 1 n 1 and further decompose each r into a disjoint union of rectangles kr each congruent to q l 1 lj 1 n 1 n by the usual knapp argument e g t x on a tube t of volume t 1 l 2 j 1 we will prove that for each r there exist t x kr such that kr t t x on 1 kr t 3 3 where on 1 0 as n and is otherwise independent of define f r r e i tr xr g kr e i t x g with tr xr r r r 1 d and r kr 1

upper bounds above rectangles in this section we provide details for the deduction of theorem 1 3 from known results and prove theorem 1 5 by fatou s lemma it suffices to prove these results when 0 d we recall the hypothesis that l 1 ld we begin by collecting from the literature the details needed to establish theo rem 1 3 we will apply theorem 1 4 of 3 to obtain a bilinear restriction result for the convenience of the reader we record that in the notation of 3 we are using q r d 3 d 1 h 1 h 2 vmax 1 and d 0 is the ball of radius min 1 l 1 d bounds the measures of certain intersection hypersurfaces in rd see 1 10 fourier restriction above rectangles 11 lemma 4 1 3 let g be elliptic over the rectangle q with ld 1 and let b 1 b 2 be two balls of radius 1 separated by a distance 1 and intersecting q for functions fj l 2 q supp fj bj and q 2 d 3 d 1 e gf 1 e gf 2 q 2 f 1 2 f 2 2 using the invariance of the ellipticity hypothesis under parabolic rescaling we obtain a bilinear restriction estimate for functions supported on balls of radius r separated by a distance r which leads to theorem 1 3 via the bilinear to linear argument of tao vargas vega 15 we omit the details we now turn to the proof of theorem 1 5 beginning with bounds corresponding directly to lower dimensional restriction theorems lemma 4 2 5 theorem 1 5 holds on each half open segment q d j 2 d j p p q j

exponent pair proof because the lemma was not stated as such in 5 we give the complete proof when p 1 q the result is a direct application of ho lder s inequality let 0 j d 1 let q d j 2 d j p p 1 and assume that conjecture 1 2 is valid in dimension d j for this exponent pair given f c 0 q we take the fourier transform of e g in the x variables to obtain fx e gf t x e g f t x where we have split the coordinates as x x x rj rd j and we are writing h h for h a function on rd after making a linear transformation which amounts to replacing g with g g 0 g 0 we see that the hypothesized conjecture

dimensions d j 1 and d j implies validity of conjecture 1 4 on the region 2 d j 1 d j q 2 d j d j 1 for 0 j d 2 this completes the proof of theorem 1 5 in the range q 10 3 proof by ho lder s inequality for q p e g lp lq l 1 ld 1 q 1 p e g lq lq so it suffices to verify the theorem on the line q p by the drury guo dimension reduction argument used in the proof of lemma 4 2 e g lq lq l 1 lj

to the fully unconditional results lemma 4 5 theorem 1 5 holds in the region q 4 fourier restriction above rectangles 13 proof the proof is a direct deduction from lemma 4 2 applied in the case q 3 p

lemma 4 5 we may assume that q 4 by lemma 4 2 we may assume that q 2 p by adapting the first part of the proof of lemma 4 4 which reduces the dimension and reduces to the case q p we may assume that d

p 2 by interpolation with the known inequality e g lp lq 1 on the line q 3 p q p we may assume in addition that 8 q 2 p 3 finally by real interpolation it suffices to bound e gf q for f a finite measure set we adapt the argument of tao vargas vega 15 making a whitney decompo sition q q n 0 dn where dn denotes a finitely overlapping collection of width 1 height 2 n rectangles contained in q

thus remains to bound the terms with n 0 when n 0 and rescaling lemma 4 1 implies that ef ef q 2 2 n 2 8 q f 2 f 2 14 jeremy schwend and betsy stovall thus we obtain by following the argument of 15 that n 1 dn ef ef q 2 q 2 n 1 2 n q 4 dn q 4 q 4 n 1 2 n q 4 dn q 2 n 1 2 n q 4 min 2 n q 2 1 4 4 here we have used the fact that min min 2 n for each dn our proof now bifurcates into two cases 1 and 1 if 1 the right hand side of 4 4 is bounded by q 2 q p since p 2 if 1 the right hand side of 4 4 is bounded by log n 1 2 n 3 q 2 5 n log 2 n q 4 q 2 3 q 2 4 q p where we have used 2 p 8 q 3 in the last inequality 5 the application the proof of theorem 1 7 we turn now to the proof of theorem 1 7 to which we devote the entirety of this section by the triangle inequality and the symmetry of changing the sign of any i it suffices to bound the operator e f t x 0 1 d e i t x 1 1 d d f d we begin by making a dyadic decomposition 0 1 d k nd rk rk i 2 2 ki i 1 d which induces the decomposition e k nd ek ek f t x rk ei t x 1 1 d d f d for a permutation in sd we define k k nd k 1 1 k d d and e k k ek by the triangle inequality it suffices to bound each e we will do this by first bounding the partial sums e k 1 k k k 1 ek k k 1 k j d j 2 nd 1 k 1 1 k 2 2 k d d we restate conjecture 1 4 and proposition 1 8 as they apply to the ek fourier restriction above rectangles 15 lemma 5 1 let p q 1 and assume that the conclusions of conjecture 1 4 hold for this exponent pair let k k if q p and q d j 2 d j p for some 0 j d and 0 1 then ek lp lq 5 1 j m 1 2 2 k m 2 k j 1 j 1 1 2 j 1 d m j 2 2 k m

without the loss 2 k j 1 j 1 k d d in the range p q 4 but since this loss is harmless for our application we have left it in to simplify the statement proof the lemma is proved by introducing coordinates i 2 2 i k i i rk producing the function gk d i 1 2 k i i 2 i i i which is elliptic to arbitrary order over a rectangle i 2 k i i in the notation of conjecture 1 4 this rectangle is congruent to q where 2 k 1 1 2 k d d proof of theorem 1 7 we will give the details of the proof only in the case i 6 2 for all i in the case that i 2 for some i we may use a galilean transformation in those coordinates i with i 2 to see that e lp lq k nd ek lp lq 5 3 where the prime indicates a sum taken over those k nd with ki 1 for all i such that i 2 since the difficulty in the general case lies in summing over those ki such that i 6 2 we will give the complete details only in the case that i 6 2 for all i the change needed to handle the general case is just notational for most cases we will use an interpolation lemma whose hypotheses will neces sitate boundedness of ek as an operator from lp to lq for p q lying in a neigh borhood in r 2 of p q thus we begin by dispensing with those cases wherein p q lies on the boundary of the region td defined in 1 7 the case q is elementary e lp l for all p 1 by ho lder s inequality the case p q may arise under condition ii or iv but the claimed bounds for such pairs follow from the claimed bounds with finite p by 16 jeremy schwend and betsy stovall ho lder s inequality except possibly for the point p q 1 1 jd which can arise under condition iv the case p q d 2 d p is a little more involved on the one hand in the notation of lemma 5 1 j 0 so 5 1 reads ek lp l d 2 d p d j 1 2 k i 2 i 1 p 1 q 5 4 on the other hand from the hypothesis i 6 2 and the ordering 1 d the difference jn d n 2 jn 1 d n 12 1 n 1 2 is increasing in n and never zero therefore the case q p d 2 d 1 1 j 0 d 0 2 of condition i of the theorem is only possible when n 7 jn d n 2 has a strict minimum at 0 i e when i 2 for all i in this case all of the exponents in 5 4 are negative and it is elementary to sum we will specifically address the case p q 1 1 jd at the end of the proof but for now we may assume that the bounds in lemma 5 1 hold for exponent pairs in a neighborhood in r 2 of p q by the reductions above and real interpolation it suffices to prove that the bounds expressed in the theorem hold for all pairs q max d 2 d p 2 d 1 d obeying in addition one of the conditions i ii and p or iv we now complete the argument in the case of i let p q d j 2 d j p for some 0 j d and 0 1 we start by proving bounds for the e k 1 for exponent pairs p q lying in a neighborhood of some pair obeying i thus we do not yet assume that i holds since 1 2 i 6 0 for all i applying 5 1 and summing a geometric series e k 1 lp lq k k k 1 ek lp lq k 2 k j 1 j m 1 2 2 k m 2 k j 1 j 1 d i j 1 1 2 i 1 p 1 q where the s indicate sums over 1 k m 1 k m m m 1 for 0 l j if l d i j

k 2 k j l k j l j l m 1 2 2 k m 1 p 1 q 5 6 suppose now that condition i holds we may sum the right side of 5 5 in k 1 whenever j d i 1 1 2 i and the right side of 5 6 may be summed in k 1 unconditionally condition i for our p q is after a bit of arithmetic equivalent to j d i 1 1 2 i thus it remains to consider the case l d i j 1 l 1 2 i 0 l j and j d i 1 1 2 i 5 7 let j 0 j j 1 and 0 0 1 1 with j 0 0 j j 1 1 and j ji i sufficiently small i 0 1 then with p i d ji i d ji i 2 q q pi and inequality 5 1 holds at pi q furthermore since j 1 j 5 7 implies 1 l d i j 1 1 l 1 2 i 0 l j 1 provided 1 is sufficiently small and we may argue similarly for 0 when j 0 j if j 0 j we may assume that j 0 j 1 so 0 l l 1 d i j 1 l 1 1 2 i d i j 0 1 l 1 2 i 0 l 1 j j 0 1 therefore by 5 5 e k 1 lpi lq 2 ik 1 where i 1 i ji d i 1 1 2 i 1 p i 1 q i 0 1 we observe that 0 0 1 thus for f comparable to the characteristic function of a measurable set k 1 e k 1 f lq k 1 min 2 0 k 1 1 p 0 2 1 k 1 1 p 1 0 p 1 1 p 0 0 1 1 p some arithmetic is needed for the last equality this implies the restricted weak type inequality and so completes the proof of the restricted weak type inequality in the case q p since the riesz diagram lacks any vertex in the region q p by real interpolation the proof is complete for q p we now turn to the case q 2 d j 1 d j p for any integer n max 0 n n n 1 2 q 2 jn 1 p 1 q n i 1 1 2 q 2 i 1 p 1 q 18 jeremy schwend and betsy stovall thus iv can be rewritten as q p and d 1 i 1 1 2 q 2 i 1 p 1 q d 1 2 q 2 q and d i 1 1 2 q 2 i 1 p 1 q d 1 2 q 2 q this implies that 1 2 q 2 d 1 p 1 q 0 which by our assumption that 1 1 1 d further implies since p q that 1 2 q 2 i 1 p 1 q 0 for all i collecting these observations and making similar but simpler manipulations in the case of ii we may rewrite conditions ii and p and iv as ii q p and d i 1 1 2 q 2 i 1 p 1 q d 1 2 q 2 q iv q p and 1 2 q 2 i 1 p 1 q 0 for all i and 1 jd q jd p let us now assume that we are in case ii then by 5 2 e k 1 lp lq 2 k 1 1 k 2 k j 1 j m 1 2 2 k m 1 p 1 q 2 k j 1 j 1 1 2 q d m j 1 1 2 q 2 m 1 p 1 q 5 8 where the extra factor in front accounts for the loss in 2 k j 1 j 1 coming from 5 2 mimicking the inductive argument from before if l 1 2 q d m j 1 l 1 2 q 2 m 1 p 1 q 0 for any 0 l j the right hand side of 5 8 is summable in k 1 also as before if l 1 2 q d m j 1 l 1 2 q 2 m 1 p 1 q 0 0 l j then we have e k 1 lp lq 2 k 1 1 j 1 2 q d m 1 1 2 q 2 m 1 p 1 q 5 9 by inserting the definition of q into ii and taking sufficiently small the exponent on the right hand side of 5 9 is negative and so we may again sum in k 1 we will turn in a moment to iv but for now we assume only that q 2 d j 1 d j p and 1 2 q 2 i 1 p 1 q 0 for all i taking 1 2 q 2 i 1 p 1 q i 1 d 5 2 implies e k 1 lp lq k 2 k

implies e k 1 lp lq 2 k 1 1 j 1 2 q d m 1 1 2 q 2 m 1 p 1 q 5 12 while if 5 11 fails for some 0 l j the right hand side of 5 10 may be summed in k 1 now we assume that iv holds the equation 1 jd q jd p can be rewritten after a little algebra as j 1 2 q d m 1 1 2 q 2 m 1 p 1 q 0 our analysis now breaks into three cases if q p we choose q p 0 p p 1 with p pi sufficiently small that 5 11 holds with pi q in place of p q for f comparable to a characteristic function e f lq k 1 min i 0 1 2 k 1 j 1 2 q d m 1 1 2 q 2 m 1 p i 1 q 1 pi 1 p which implies the restricted weak type inequality that we want if q p condition iii holds so we must prove a strong type inequality on the line 1 jd q jd p equation 5 11 continues to hold for some q p and condition i holds for q p the strong type inequality follows by real interpolation and estimates already proved finally if p q 1 jd 1 taking j 0 0 j j 1 1 and qi 2 d ji i 1 d ji i for ji i j sufficiently small 5 11 holds we may rewrite 5 12 as e k 1 l lqi 2 k 1 1 d i ji 2 jd 1 2 qi 2 jd qi as the exponent on the right is positive for i 0 and negative for i 1 we see after some arithmetic that for f 1 f 2 comparable to characteristic functions e f 1 f 2 k min 2 k 1 d i ji 2 jd 1 2 qi 2 jd qi 2 1 q i 2 1 q which implies the claimed restricted weak type inequality in the remaining case 6 the negative result proof of proposition 1 8 we use the notation established at the beginning of the previous section rescal ing the lower bounds in theorem 1 6 analogously to the proof of lemma 5 1 yields the following lower bounds on the ek lemma 6 1 assume that k 1 1 k 2 2 kd d if q d j 2 d j p p for some 0 j d and 0 1 then ek rwtlp lq j i 1 2 2 ki 2 kj 1 j 1 1 2 j 1 d i j 2 2 ki i 1 2 i 1 p 1 q 6 1 20 jeremy schwend and betsy stovall additionally if q 2 d j 1 d j p for some 0 1 and j 0 d 1 ek rwtlp lq j i 1 2 2 ki 1 p 1 q 2 kj 1 j 1 1 1 2 q 2 j 1 1 p 1 q d i j 2 2 ki i 1 2 q 2 i 1 p 1 q kj 1 j 1 kd d 6 2 for some increasing depending on p q d satisfying 0 1 and r as r proof of proposition 1 8 let p q 1 2 and assume that none of the condi tions i iv hold we may assume that p q td and p 6 1 q 6 we may define j depending on p q such that q can be written in one of the forms given in lemma 6 1 failure of conditions i iv for p q td leads to a choice of an integer n 1 namely if q p we choose 1 n d such that q p 1 1 jn d n 2 if q p we choose n d if 1 jd q jd p and otherwise choose n d such that 1 jn d n q jn p d n 2 a bit of arithmetic shows that in any of these cases n j let n 1 sufficiently large and define k n 1 n n 1

large if 2 jn n j 0 which after a little algebra is equivalent to q p 1 1 jn d n 2 next we suppose q p by 6 2 e k rwtlp lq j i 1 2 2 ki 1 p 1 q 2 2 kj 1 1 p 1 q kj 1 j 1 1 1 2 q d i j 2 2 ki i 1 2 q 2
