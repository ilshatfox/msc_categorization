functions modulo constants with seminorm given by the norm of u in l 2 rn 1 and the dirichlet to neumann map defined by f f u a au en 1 a u t 0 extends to a mapping from h 1 2 rn i 1 2 l 2 rn to h 1 2 rn where h 1 2 rn denotes the dual space of the fractional sobolev space h 1 2 rn see hkmp here i 1 2 denotes the usual 1 2 order ho mogeneous fractional integral operator i e riesz potential we also define the homogeneous sobolev space l 2 1 rn to be the completion of c 0 rn with respect to the seminorm f 2 for convenience we set h 1 rn l 2 1 rn and we define the inhomogeneous version by h 1 rn l 2 rn h 1 rn for 0 small enough depending only on n and we obtain that h 1 r n l 2 r n 1 4 in fact 1 4 is an immediate consequence of the solution of the regularity problem given in aaahk theorem 1 14 we let c 0 1 rn denote the space of lipschitz functions with norm g c 0 1 rn sup x y rn x y g x g y x y now we can state our main results as follows the first generalizes the classical commutator theorem of a p caldero n ca theorem 1 1 suppose that a satisfies 1 1 and 1 2 with sufficiently small depending on dimension and ellipticity then for any f l 2 rn and g c 0 1 rn g f l 2 rn c f l 2 rn g c 0 1 rn 1 5 where the constant c depends only on n and theorem 1 2 suppose that a satisfies the hypotheses of theorem 1 1 then for any f l rn and g h 1 rn g f l 2 rn c f l rn g h 1 rn 1 6 where the constant c depends only on n and analogous results were previously obtained in kls for the laplacian in a lipschitz domain as part of the authors study of homogenization our results with a real and symmetric include this case by a well known pullback mechanism a different generalization of the results in kls has been obtained 2 in sh for elliptic systems in lipschitz domains with ho lder continuous coefficients neither our work nor that of sh subsumes the other the approach to these commutator results in both papers kls and sh is based on a bilinear estimate of dahlberg d and it s extension in sh to certain variable coefficient elliptic systems in h the first author of this paper established dahlberg s bilinear estimate for the class of second order elliptic operators enjoying the same assumptions that we impose here i e the matrix a satisfies 1 1 and 1 2 with small enough in the upper half space the latter result along with layer potential technology for the operators under consideration will allow us to follow the strategy in kls and sh to obtain the stated theorems remark 1 in our theorem 1 2 as compared to its analogue sh theorem 1 2 we obtain an estimate in terms of the l norm of the boundary data as opposed to that of the solution u itself since we establish an agmon miranda maximum principle for our solutions see sh remark 1 4 and section 4 below the paper is organized as follows in the next section we discuss certain preliminaries in section 3 we prove theorem 1 1 in section 4 we establish an agmon miranda maximum principle for the class of operators under consideration which we then use in section 5 to give the proof of theorem 1 2 2 preliminaries we begin by setting some notational conventions for convenience we often write b d and b d to mean that there exists a positive constant c depending only on dimension and the quantitative hypotheses of our theorems such that respectively b cd and c 1 d b cd we normally use q to denote cubes in rn and for 0 we let q be the concentric dilate of q with side length q let us now recall the de giorgi nash moser estimates under the same assumptions as in theorem 1 1 in fact t independence is not required there is a constant c and an exponent 0 both depending only on dimension and ellipticity such that for any ball b b x r if lu 0 in 2 b b x 2 r then u y u z c y z r 2 b u 2 1 2 dgn whenever y z b and sup y b u y c 2 b u 2 1 2 m as is well known these results may be found in d m n in the case of real coefficients the extension to the case of complex perturbations of real coefficients is due to auscher a see theorem 4 1 below we shall make use of the theory of layer potential operators associated to an operator l div a as in 1 1 1 2 let e x t y s el x t y s be the fundamental solution of l the existence of the fundamental solution in our setting is given in hk by t independence of our coefficients we have that e x t y s e x t s y 0 2 1 the single and double layer potential operators associated to l are defined respectively by st f x s l t f x rn e x t y 0 f y dy t r x rn dt f x d l t f x rn a e y 0 x t f y dy t 0 x rn 2 2 3 where a is the hermitian adjoint of a and a e y 0 x t n 1 j 1 a n 1 j y e y j y 0 x t en 1 a y y se y s x t s 0 2 3 here e el denotes the fundamental solution of l the hermitian adjoint of l and we have e y s x t e x t y s 2 4 we shall use the following notations d j x j x j 1 j n 1 where xn 1 t so that dn 1 t and for a vector v v 1 v 2 vn 1 r n 1 we let v v 1 v 2 vn 0 v 1 v 2 vn denote the projection of v onto rn 0 similarly we define x 1 xn we shall set st f x rn y se x t y s s 0 f y dy so that stdn 1 tst st f st div f 2 5 for say f c 1 0 rn cn for all m 1 it follows from 2 1 2 5 that adj m 1 t st m 1 t s l t 2 6 here the choice of plus or minus depends on m and adj m 1 t dt a m 1 t s l t 2 7 where s l t denotes the single layer potential with associated to l the adjoint co normal derivative is defined by a n 1 j 1 a n 1 j d j and adj t denotes the hermitian adjoint of an operator t acting in r n remark 2 by aaahk theorem for l div a with a satisfying 1 1 and 1 2 with small enough depending on dimension and ellipticity we have the layer potential bounds sup t 0 s l t f l 2 rn s l t f l 2 rn f l 2 rn in particular this yields l 2 boundedness of the double layer potential dt uniformly in t of course analogous results hold with l replaced by its adjoint l given x 0 r n and 0 define the cone x 0 x t r n 1 x 0 x t then for measurable function f rn 1 c the non tangential maximal operator n is defined n f x 0 sup x t x 0 f x t and note that when 1 we shall often simply write 1 and n f n 1 f we recall that the l 2 norms of n n 1 and n are equivalent for any 0 see fs following kp we also introduce n f x 0 sup x t 1 x 0 x t y s t 4 f y s 2 dyds 1 2 these bounds continue to hold in the absence of condition 1 2 for a suitable definition of the layer potentials see r 4 where the symbol denotes the mean value i e e f e 1 e f we say u f n t to mean that for a e x rn lim y t x 0 u y t f x where the limit runs over y t x and in the sequel we shall use the notation 9 9 as a short hand for the t 2 2 tent space norm see cms i e 9 f 9 r n 1 f x t 2 dxdt t 1 2 next we state a technical lemma concerning the single layer potential as well as general solutions the lemma will follow essentially immediately from known results and will be useful in the sequel lemma 2 1 suppose that a l satisfy the same hypotheses as in theorem 1 1 let f l 2 rn cn 1 f l rn cn 1 and let m 1 then sup t 0 t m m 1 t s l t f l 2 rn f l 2 rn 2 8 9 tm m 1 t s l t f 9 f l 2 rn 2 9 and sup q 1 q q 0 q t m m 1 t s l t f x 2 dxdt t f 2 l rn 2 10 furthermore for every cube q and all 0 t 16 q t m m 1 t s l t f 12 k 1 q 2 kq 2 l 2 q 2 nk 2 2 k t 2 k q 2 m f 2 l 2 2 k 1 q 2 kq k 1 2 11 finally suppose that lu 0 in rn 1 with supt 0 u t 2 then t m m 1 t u sup t 0 u t 2 2 12 in all of these estimates the implicit constants depend on m n and ellipticity of course the correspond ing estimates hold also in the lower half space and with l replaced by l sketch of proof given the l 2 bounds discussed in remark 2 the case m 1 of estimate 2 8 is aaahk lemma 2 11 we caution the reader that the exponents in aaahk lemma 2 11 are written differently so that the case m 1 there corresponds to our case m 1 the case m 1 may be reduced to the case m 1 by an induction argument which exploits the caccioppoli on slices estimate in aaahk proposition 2 1 we omit the details for m 1 the square function bound 2 9 is hmam lemma 3 1 the carleson measure estimate 2 10 is hmam corollary 3 3 estimate 3 4 and the square function bound 2 12 is h lemma 3 1 for each of 2 9 2 10 and 2 12 the case m 1 may be reduced to the case m 1 by an induction argument that uses caccioppoli s inequality in whitney boxes we omit the details finally using again the caccioppoli on slices estimate in aaahk proposition 2 1 one may reduce estimate 2 11 to aaahk lemma 2 9 i again we omit the details we shall also require some of the main results in aaahk which we summarize as follows theorem 2 2 aaahk theorem 1 14 suppose that l div a a and a 0 are defined as above then the dirichlet problem lu 0 in rn 1 lim t 0 u t f in l 2 rn and n t n u 2 9 t u 9 f 2 d l 2 5 and the regularity problem lu 0 in r n 1 lim t 0 u t f in l 21 r n n t n u 2 f 2 r l 2 are both solvable if is sufficiently small depending only on n and the solution of d l 2 is unique and the solutions of r l 2 are unique modulo constants analogous conclusions hold for l 3 proof of theorem 1 1 under the same assumptions of our main theorems using the results of aaahk we see that if u is the solution of the regularity problem r l 2 with data f h 1 rn then f 2 u a 2 n u 2 f 2 i e 1 4 holds for the dirichlet to neumann map remark 3 we note that for f h 1 rn l 2 rn h 1 rn we may solve both r l 2 and d l 2 with boundary data f and the respective resulting solutions ur amd ud are the same this fact follows from the compatible solvability of the solutions constructed in hkmp theorem 1 11 the commutator of with a function g is defined by g f g f g f note that for g f h 1 rn and f h 1 rn both g f and g f are well defined let c 0 b 0 1 such that is radial 0 1 and rn 1 and set v x t pt g t g 3 1 where t x t n x t observe that pt thus defines a nice approximate identity in particular pt 1 1 and pt 1 0 let us note for future reference the elementary fact that v x t t g x t t g cx t x x y t g y dy 3 2 by poincare s inequality where we have chosen cx t x y t g y dy for any h c 0 rn by theorem 2 2 we let u be the solution of d l 2 with boundary data f u f g be the solution of d l 2 with boundary data f g and h be the solution of d l 2 with boundary data h thus according to the definition of the dirichlet to neumann map along with a standard variational more precisely they are equal modulo an additive constant 6 formulation of the divergence theorem for solutions rn g f h rn u f g h rn u gh r n 1 a u f g h r n 1 a u hv r n 1 a u vh r n 1 u f ga h r n 1 ua hv r n 1 a u vh r n 1 u f ga h r n 1 uv a h r n 1 u va h r n 1 a u vh rn f g h a rn f g h a r n

since g c 0 1 rn if v is defined as above then v l g l and d t 2 v x t 2 dxdt t is a carleson measure on r n 1 with norm c g l 3 4 our goal is to show that rn g f h g l f 2 h 2 h c 0 rn 3 5 to prove 3 5 we see from the equality 3 3 that rn g f h r n 1 u va h r n 1 a u vh i j we observe that the two terms i and j are of essentially the same type since u is the solution of d l 2 with boundary data f l 2 rn while h is the solution of d l 2 with boundary data h l 2 rn we now claim that it suffices to prove the estimate r n 1 a u w n u 2 9 t u 9 n w 2 9 t w 9 3 6 where a satisfies 1 1 and 1 2 and where l u div a u 0 in rn 1 indeed taking 3 6 for granted momentarily we may apply the latter estimate to term j in the case that the values of u a w are respectively u a vh or to term i with these values given respectively by h a vu in the former scenario by theorem 2 2 we have n u 2 9 t u 9 f 2 n w 2 n vh 2 v l n h 2 g l h 2 and 9 t w 9 9 t v h 9 9 t 2 vh v l 9 t h 9 g l n h 2 g l h 2 7 where we used 3 4 a similar discussion is applicable to the other case and 3 5 follows it remains to prove 3 6 we will actually prove a slightly sharper version of 3 6 which is a generalization of the dahlberg type bilinear estimate in h for notational convenience we shall remove the tilde and just write l div a where a satisfies 1 1 and 1 2 and we shall replace u by u andw by its complex conjugate recall the definition of the standard y 1 2 space y 1 2 r n 1 u l 2 n 1 n 1 2 r n 1 u l 2 r n 1 lemma 3 1 let a l be as above and let m be an arbitrary bounded n 1 n 1 matrix valued function on rn suppose that w w 1 2 loc rn cn 1 and that u y 1 2 rn 1 is a solution of l u 0 in rn 1 then r n 1 m u w m l rn sup t 0 u t l 2 rn n w l 2 rn 9 t w 9 of course lemma 3 1 with u u implies 3 6 since trivially supt 0 u t l 2 rn n u l 2 rn proof without loss of generality we may suppose that m l rn 1 the special case that m i the n 1 n 1 identity matrix is proved in h and the argument there may be readily adapted mutatis mutandis to prove this version for the sake of self containment and because will shall need to pursue this point anyway to prove theorem 1 2 we shall present a slightly different proof similar but with a small modification to that of h the proof of theorem 1 1 will still be a rather routine adaptation of the arguments in h in the case of theorem 1 2 matters will be a bit more subtle for now as in h it is enough to show sup 0 1 m sup 0 1 2 1 rn m x u x t w x t dxdt d sup t 0 u t l 2 rn n w 2 9 t w 9 3 7 we may assume supt 0 u t l 2 rn n w 2 9 t w 9 since otherwise 3 7 is trivial for each fixed integrating by parts in t we obtain the bound m 2 1 rn m x tu x t w x t dx tdt d 2 1 rn m x u x t tw x t dx tdt d b i ii b 3 8 here the term b is a sum of two boundary terms satisfying b sup r 0 2 r r rn r 2 u x t 2 dxdt 1 2 sup r 0 w r 2 sup r 0 u r 2 sup r 0 w r 2 as desired where in the integral involving u we have split rn into cubes of side length r and used caccioppoli s inequality for term ii in 3 8 by cauchy schwarz we have the bound ii 9 t u 9 9 t w 9 sup t 0 u t l 2 rn 9 t w 9 8 where we have used the case m 1 of 2 12 to obtain the inequality 9 t u 9 supt 0 u t l 2 rn we turn now to term i by the change of variable t 2 t and an integration by parts in t i 2 2 1 2 2 rn m x tu x 2 t w x 2 t dx tdt d 2 1 2 2 rn m 2 t u 2 t w 2 t dx t 2 dt d 2 1 2 2 rn m tu 2 t tw 2 t dx t 2 dt d i 1 i 2 we handle i 2 like term ii above by cauchy schwarz and the case m 2 of 2 12 we have i 2 9 t 2 tu 9 9 t w 9 sup t 0 u t l 2 rn 9 t w 9 to bound term i 1 we integrate by parts again in t to obtain i 1 i 1 i 1 where i 1 2 1 2 2 rn m x 3 t u x 2 t w x 2 t dx t 3 dt d 3 9 and i 1 2 1 2 2 rn m 2 t u 2 t tw 2 t dx t 3 dt d term i 1 can be treated just like terms ii and i 2 using cauchy schwarz and the case m 3 of 2 12 we omit the now familiar details it remains now only to consider i 1 with t 0 fixed set ft x tu x t and note that ft l 2 rn t 1 sup 0 u l 2 rn by the moser type local boundedness assumption m above and cacioppoli s inequality moreover by t independence of the coefficients tu t is a solution in r n 1 so by green s formula we can write tu t s ds ft ss a tu t 3 10 observe that at least formally using t independence and the fact that tu is a solution a tu t n 1 j 1 dn 1 an 1 j d ju t s s 0 n i 1 n 1 j 1 di ai jd ju x t s s 0 a u t where we interpret the identity in the weak sense on rn see aaahk lemma 2 15 consequently setting s t in 3 10 we get 3 t u 2 t 2 tdt ft 2 t st a u t 3 11 the point is to accumulate enough t derivatives in order to ensure sufficient decay see 3 12 below see e g bhlmp theorem 4 16 for a justification of the green formula in this setting in fact in a more general setting 9 where we have used 2 5 we may then obtain the bound rn m x 3 t u x 2 t w x 2 t dx k t l t where by 2 7 and the definition of ft k t rn m x 2 tdt ft x w x 2 t dx rn tu t a 2 t s l t m w 2 t dx and by 2 6 l t rn m x 2 t st a u t x w x 2 t dx rn a u t 2 t s l t m w 2 t dx in turn plugging these bounds into 3 9 and using cauchy schwarz we obtain the bound i 1 0 k t l t tdt 0 rn t u x t 2 dxdt t 1 2 0 rn t 3 2 t s l t m w 2 t x 2 dxdt t 1 2 a b observe that a 9 t u 9 and since u is a solution by the case m 1 of 2 12 we have a 9 t u 9 sup t 0 u t l 2 rn consider now the factor b recall that our goal is to show that b n w l 2 rn 9 t w 9 to this end we set t t 3 2 t s l t and as above let pt be a nice approximate identity with a smooth radial compactly supported kernel we then write t m w 2 t x t m x ptw 2 t x rtw 2 t x where for a function f valued in cn 1 in particular for f w 2 t with t momentarily fixed we define rt f x t m f x t m x pt f x for future reference we observe that one may define rt on n 1 n 1 matrix valued functions in the obvious way we then have b 9 t m ptw 2 t 9 9 rtw 2 t 9 by the carleson measure estimate 2 10 applied to l in the lower half space with m 3 we have 9 t m ptw 2 t 9 n ptw 2 t l 2 rn n 3 w l 2 rn n w l 2 rn where in the last step we have used the well known observation of fs that non tangential maximal functions defined using cones with different apertures are equivalent in lp norm 10 finally we consider the contribution of the remainder term rt by 2 11 applied to l in the lower half space with m 3 t f 12 k 1 q 2 kq 2 l 2 q 2 nk 2 2 k t 2 k q 6 f 2 l 2 2 k 1 q 2 k q 2 nk t 2 k q 4 f 2 l 2 2 k 1 q 2 kq 3 12 uniformly for each k 1 and 0 t 16 q in addition by 2 8 t is bounded on l 2 rn cn 1 uniformly in t 0 by aaahk lemma 3 11 and the definition of pt these facts continue to hold with rt in place of t in turn this allows one to define rt 1 as an element of l 2 loc where 1 denotes the n 1 n 1 identity matrix and by construction rt 1 0 since the approximate identity pt preserves constants thus we may apply aaahk lemma 3 5 to rt to deduce that rn rtw x 2 t 2 dx t 2 rn xw x 2 t 2 dx consequently 9 rtw 2 t 9 9 t w 2 t 9 as desired this completes the proof of lemma 3 1 and hence that of theorem 1 1 4 solvability with l data and an agmon miranda maximum principle recall the following result of auscher a theorem 4 1 a let a a 0 and l be as above but possibly t dependent if is small enough depend ing only on n and then there is a positive exponent and a constant c each depending only on n and such that given u solving lu 0 in a ball 2 b b x 2 r with r 0 u y u z c y z r 2 b u 2 1 2 y z b b y r 4 1 here capital letters denote points in rn 1 e g x x t from theorem 4 1 we may deduce the following corollary 4 2 let a a 0 and l be as above but possibly t dependent if is small enough depending only on n and then there is a positive exponent and a constant c each depending only on n and such that given any cube q rn and its double 2 q along with their associated carleson boxes rq q 0 l q and r 2 q 2 q 0 2 l q and a solution u w 1 2 r 2 q vanishing in the trace sense on 2 q then u x t c t q 1 q n 1 r 2 q u 2 1 2 x t rq 4 2 proof the proof follows immediately from theorem 4 1 by making an odd reflection across the bound ary 2 q 0 we omit the details corollary 4 3 let a a 0 and l be as in theorems 1 1 1 2 in particular t independent and 4 1 with small enough that d l 2 and r l 2 are both solvable see theorem 2 2 let f l 2 rn and let u be 11 the solution of d l 2 with boundary data f if f vanishes on 2 q then the conclusion of corollary 4 2 continues to hold proof note that if we were to assume f h 1 rn then the solution of r l 2 with boundary data f satisfies the assumptions in corollary 4 2 thus 4 2 holds moreover as we have previously mentioned by hkmp the problems d l 2 and r l 2 are compatibly solvable in particular for data f h 1 rn the solution of d l 2 with data f equals the solution of r l 2 with data f the latter is unique only up to an additive constant but will be equal to the former for a suitable choice of this constant since f l 2 rn and vanishes on 2 q we can approximate f in l 2 norm by fk c h 1 rn with each fk vanishing on 3 2 q let uk denote the solution to d l 2 and compatibly to r l 2 with data fk since corollary 4 2 clearly holds with 3 2 q in place of 2 q we find that 4 2 holds for each uk uniformly in k we may then pass to the limit as follows observe that 4 2 holds with u replaced by uk and that by the l 2 estimates for d l 2 sup t 0 u t uk t 2 f fk 2 0 as k consequently for x t rn 1 fixed combining the latter estimate with the interior moser type local boundedness estimate we obtain u x t uk x t 2 t t 2 x y t u y s uk y s 2 dyds 1 2 t n 2 t t 2 rn u y s uk y s 2 dyds 1 2 0 as k similarly for any fixed cube q rn r 2 q u uk 2 q 0 rn u y s uk y s 2 dyds 0 as k we conclude that 4 2 holds for u in the sequel let x r y rn x y r denote the surface ball of radius r and center x on rn rn 1 lemma 4 4 let a l be as in corollary 4 3 let x rn and 0 t 1 100 r with r r suppose that g l with supp g s r r s r r x x r x r let v solve d l 2 with boundary data g then there exists a constant c c n such that v x t c t r g l 4 3 uniformly in r for r r where 0 is the exponent in corollaries 4 2 and 4 3 proof set k k x x 2 k y r n x y 2 k k 0 1 2 and s k k 1 k k z 12 thus s r r k r k k r s k where 2 k r r and 2 k r r consequently v k r k k r vk where vk solves d l 2 with boundary data gk g 1 s k by corollary 4 3 and the solvability of d l 2 we have vk x t t 2 k 2 k 0 k vk 2 1 2 t 2 k 2 kn s k g 2 1 2 t 2 k g l summing up k k r we get 4 3 we are now able to prove the following proposition 4 5 let a a 0 and l be as in corollary 4 3 let f l rn then there is a solution u of lu 0 in rn 1 such that u 0 f in the sense of non tangential convergence satisfying the agmon miranda maximum principle u l rn 1 c f l rn where c c n proof given a point x 0 r n we define the dyadic surface balls centered at x 0 on r n r n 0 rn 1 by k k x 0 x 0 2 k y r n x 0 y 2 k k z and set s k k 1 k k z so that ks k r n 0 we let fk f 1 s k and uk be the solution of d l 2 with boundary data fk define f n n k fk u n n k uk clearly un is the unique solution of d l 2 with boundary data f n to prove the proposition we will show that u lim n u n exists at each point of rn 1 and satisfies the conclusion of the theorem moreover u is well defined in the sense that if u is constructed in the same way as u but for a different center x 0 then u u to this end we fix a point x t rn 1 and suppose that 2 m 2 n t x x 0 then by the definition of f n supp f m f n s r r x where r 2 n and r 2 m by lemma 4 4 u n x t um x t c t 2 n f l rn 0 as n m 0 4 4 13 thus un converges pointwise and in fact uniformly on compacta in rn 1 hence also in l 2 loc rn 1 by caccioppoli s inequality applied to un um we further see that un converges in w 1 2 loc rn 1 whence the limit u also solves lu 0 in rn 1 let us now show that u satisfies the required properties definition of u is independent of center x 0 fix two distinct points x 1 x 2 r n and construct the cor responding f n i un i i 1 2 and ui limn u n i i 1 2 as above with x 1 x 2 in place of x 0 let x t rn 1 and consider m n such that 2 m 2 n t x x 1 x x 2 then supp f m 1 f n 2 s r r where r 2 n and r 2 m again we invoke lemma 4 4 to get u n 2 x t um 1 x t c t 2 n f l rn 0 as n m 0 4 5 therefore un 2 and um 1 converge to the same limit u non tangential convergence to f fix x 0 r n and build f n and un as above relative to the center x 0 by d l 2 each un converges non tangentially to f n for a e x rn thus there is a set z nzn r n of measure zero such that un converges non tangentially to f n for every n and at every point x rn z fix such an x x 0 and let 0 consider the truncated cone at x of height x y t rn 1 x y t observe that 4 4 continues to hold with y in place of x for y t x with small and n m large we therefore have for such y t that u y t un y t lim m u m y t un y t 2 n f l rn 4 6 on the other hand if we fix n so large that f n x f x and use that un converges non tangentially to f at x then for y t x we have u n y t f x o 1 as 0 letting 0 we see that u y t f x non tangentially agmon miranda maximum principle let x t rn 1 we seek to show that u x t c f l with c c n since the definition of u is independent of the choice of x 0 used in the construction we may choose x 0 x we then define k k x s k s k x fk f 1 s k and uk as above choose k t such that 2 k t t and write u k t 10 k uk k k t 11 uk u 1 u 2 by moser local boundedness and d l 2 u 1 x t 2 t t 2 x y t u 1 y s 2 1 2 t n x y c 2 k t f 2 1 2 f l 14 since 2 k t t where all of the implicit constants in the display depend only on dimension and ellipticity furthermore for k k t by lemma 4 4 we have uk x t t 2 k f l rn and so we may sum over k k t 11 to see that u 2 x t f l rn remark 4 note that by construction if f l rn is compactly supported then the solution of d l with boundary data f and the solution of d l 2 with boundary data f are the same we conclude this section with the following recall that x r denotes the surface ball centered at x of radius r on rn rn 1 given x r let r 0 r r n 1 denote the usual carleson cylinder above proposition 4 6 let a a 0 and l be as in proposition 4 5 i e as in corollary 4 3 let f l rn and let u l rn 1 be the solution of lu 0 in r n 1 with data f constructed in proposition 4 5 set d x t t u x t 2 t 1 dxdt we then have the carleson measure estimate c sup 1 r t u x t 2 dxdt t c f 2 l rn where c depends only on dimension and ellipticity proof given our preceding work in this section the argument is standard but we include it here for the sake of completeness fix a surface ball 0 x 0 r r n set k x 0 2 kr and s k k 1 k now define fk f 1 s k let uk solve d l equivalently d l 2 see remark 4 with boundary data fk and as in the proof of proposition 4 5 set f n n k fk u n n k uk 4 7 so that un is the solution of d l 2 and of d l with boundary data f n as noted above un u in w 1 2 loc rn 1 hence for each 0 r r 0 t u n x t 2 dxdt t r 0 t u x t 2 dxdt t as n thus it is enough to show that r n r 0 0 t u n x t 2 dxdt t f 2 l rn 4 8 uniformly in n using the notation of 4 7 we write u n 0 k uk n k 1 uk u 0 n k 1 uk so that r 0 0 t u n x t 2 dxdt t 1 2 r 0 0 t u 0 x t 2 dxdt t 1 2 n k 1 r 0 0 t uk x t 2 dxdt t 1 2 i 0 n k 1 ik 15 by 2 12 with m 1 and the solvability of d l 2 we have i 0 2 f 0 2 l 2 rn x 0 2 r f x 2 dx r n f 2 l rn as desired by construction fk vanishes outside of s k so by corollary 4 3 uk is ho lder continuous up to the boundary outside of s k and we may therefore use caccioppoli s inequality at the boundary and then corollary 4 3 i e inequality 4 2 but with surface balls in place of cubes to write ik 2 r r 0 0 uk x t 2 dxdt r 1 2 r 0 x 0 2 r uk x t 2 dxdt 2 2 k r n uk 2 l rn 1 2 2 k r n f 2 l rn where in the last step we have used the agmon miranda maximum principle we may now sum a geometric series to conclude 5 proof of theorem 1 2 in this section we focus on the proof of theorem 1 2 which together with the results in the previous section comprise the main new contributions of this paper the proof will be split into two parts in part 1 we present a suitable definition of the commutator g f under the assumptions that f l rn and g h 1 rn in part 2 we prove a variant of dahlberg s bilinear estimate by a more refined version of the procedure used to prove lemma 3 1 the conclusion of the theorem then follows as in the preceding section we let x r y rn x y r denote the surface ball of radius r and center x on rn part 1 definition of g f l 2 under the hypotheses of theorem 1 2 we have from theorem 2 2 that both d 2 and r 2 are solvable for l and its adjoint l we let to denote the adjoint of observe that is the the dirichlet to neumann map for the adjoint operator l as may be seen by the gauss green formula for f l rn let u be the solution of d l with boundary data f as constructed in section 4 we may assume that g c 0 rn which is dense in h 1 rn for 0 1 and 1 r set f u and choose r c 0 b 0 2 r with r 1 on b 0 r let u r be the solution of d l 2 equivalently the solution of d l see remark 4 with boundary data f r by the agmon miranda maximum principle proved in section 4 f u satisfies that lim 0 f x f x a e x r n and sup 0 f l rn f l rn 5 1 for any h c 0 rn we shall prove the following estimate i r rn f rg h g f r h f l h l 2 g l 2 f l h l 2 g l 2 5 2 uniformly in and r in fact the implicit constants depend only on n provided is small enough with the same dependence observe that we have used 5 1 in the last step 16 taking 5 2 for granted momentarily we seek to extend estimate 5 2 to the limiting case as 0 and r to this end we define rn f g h g f h lim r lim 0 rn f rg h g f r h lim r lim 0 i r 5 3 let us show that this definition is reasonable and in particular that the limit exists we observe that at least formally rn f g h g f h rn f g h f gh 5 4 so our goal is to show that the limit in 5 3 exists and is equal to the right hand of 5 4 by aaahk theorem 1 14 solvability of r l 2 the analogue of 5 4 does hold for any 0 and r i e we can write i r as i r rn f r g h gh 5 5 by the solvability of r l 2 we know that h gh l 2 recall that we have taken g h c 0 by density consequently by 5 1 we may use dominated convergence to obtain lim 0 i r lim 0 rn f r g h gh rn f r g h gh ir since as we shall prove 5 2 holds uniformly in 0 we also have that ir f l h l 2 g l 2 5 6 set g h g h gh since 5 6 holds for any f l rn we have sup r x r x dx h l 2 g l 2 by the definition of r and thus using monotone convergence theorem we also have that l 1 rn h l 2 g l 2 consequently we obtain the desired limit lim r lim 0 i r lim r rn f r g h rn f g h by dominated convergence theorem this completes part 1 it remains to prove 5 2 part 2 the proof of 5 2 we now fix 0 1 and 1 r let f and r be defined as in part 1 above and for notational convenience we set f f r recall also that by density we may assume that g h c 0 then qualitatively with this revised notation f g h 1 rn and f h 1 rn of course by hypothesis we also have a quantitative l bound for f and moreover f now has compact support we let u be the solution of d l equivalently the solution of d l 2 see remark 4 with boundary data f and as above we let h be the solution of d l 2 with boundary data h and set v x t t g pt g where pt is a nice approximate identity with a smooth radial compactly supported kernel t 17 thus 5 2 will follow immediately once we establish the following estimate rn f g h g f h f l rn h l 2 rn g l 2 rn for all g h c 0 rn and every f h 1 rn l rn with compact support exactly as in 3 3 we have rn f g h g f h r n 1 u va h r n 1 a u vh i j 5 7 by lemma 3 1 and the solvability of d l 2 i sup t 0 h t l 2 rn n u v l 2 9 t u v 9 h l 2 n u v l 2 9 t u v 9 9 tu 2 v 9 h l 2 m 1 m 2 m 3 in turn to handle term i it is therefore enough to show that m 1 m 2 m 3 f l rn g l 2 to this end let us note that by proposition 4 6 d t u x t 2 dxdt t is a carleson measure on r n 1 with norm c f 2 l rn 5 8 recall that v ptg so that by 3 2 n v m g where m denotes the hardy littlewood maximal operator moreover t 2 v qt g where qt satisfies the classical littlewood paley estimate 9 qtf 9 f l 2 rn for arbitrary f l 2 rn consequently n v l 2 9 t 2 v 9 g l 2 5 9 with these observations in hand by the agmon miranda maximum principle and 5 9 we have m 1 u l rn 1 n v l 2 f l rn g l 2 by 5 8 carleson s lemma and 5 9 m 2 f l rn n v l 2 f l rn g l 2 and by the agmon miranda maximum principle and 5 9 m 3 u l rn 1 9 t 2 v 9 f l rn g l 2 this concludes out treatment of term i it remains to estimate term j see 5 7 above which is the heart of the matter the basic strategy will be that of lemma 3 1 but in the present setting we shall need to proceed more carefully as in the proof of lemma 3 1 it suffices to prove sup 0 1 2 1 rn a x u x t v x t h x t dxdt d f l rn h l 2 rn g l 2 rn 18 for any 0 small integrating by parts in t we have the following 1 rn a x u x t v x t hdxdt rn a t u t v t h dx t 1 t 1 rn a tu v h dx tdt 1 rn a t u tv h dx dt 1 rn a t u v th dx dt j 1 j 2 j 3 j 4 we start with the last of these uniformly in and hence in we have j 4 r n 1 t u x t v x t 2 dxdt t 1 2 0 rn t th x t 2 dxdt t 1 2 9 t u v 9 9 t h 9 f l rn g l 2 h l 2 where we have used 5 8 5 9 as for the term m 2 above along with 2 12 for the adjoint solution h and the solvability of d l 2 by cauchy schwarz j 3 9 t u h t 9 9 t 2 v 9 f l rn n h l 2 rn g l 2 rn f l rn h l 2 rn g l 2 rn as desired uniformly in hence also in where we have used 5 8 and carleson s lemma 5 9 and the fact that h solves d l 2 with data h the boundary terms j 1 are handled as follows 2 j 1 d sup r 0 2 r r rn t u x t v x t h x t dx dt 0 rn t u x t 2 v x t 2 dxdt t 1 2 n h l 2 rn f l rn g l 2 rn h l 2 rn uniformly in by 5 8 carleson s lemma and 5 9 and the fact that h solves d l 2 with data h it remains to treat j 2 to this end we begin by recording the following generalization of 5 8 which follows from the latter by the t independence of a and caccioppoli s inequality in whitney boxes for any m 1 d m t m m 1 t u x t 2 dxdt t is a carleson measure on r n 1 with norm m c f 2 l rn 5 10 with implicit constant depending of course on m as well as on dimension and ellipticity to control the term j 2 we integrate by parts up to a total of n 1 times in t that is n additional times we have already done so once for some suitably large integer n to be chosen stopping the first time that a t derivative falls on either v or h in either of the latter two cases the result is a term of the 19 same form as j 3 or j 4 along with boundary terms of the same form as j 1 except with t u replaced by tm m 1 t u for some 2 m n 1 using 5 10 in lieu of 5 8 we may handle these terms exactly like their counterparts with m 1 already treated above the one scenario that remains to be considered is that which occurs when all n 1 derivatives in t fall upon u i e it remains only to show that sup 0 1 2 1 rn a x n 1 t u x t v x t h x t dx t n 1 dt d sup 0 1 2 d f l rn h l 2 rn g l 2 rn 5 11 provided that n is chosen large enough in particular it will be enough to take n n 2 in the sequel to prove 5 11 we shall follow the outline of the argument in section 3 we first make the change of variable t 2 t to obtain cn 1 rn a x n 1 t u x 2 t v x 2 t h x 2 t dx t n 1 dt and then we use the green formula 3 10 bearing in mind our qualitative assumptions on u and set s t to get the following generalization of 3 11 n 1 t u 2 t nt dt ft nt st a u t where as before ft tu t we may then setw t v t h t and use 2 6 and 2 7 to write rn a x n 1 t u x 2 t v x 2 t h x 2 t dx kn t ln t where kn t rn a x nt dt ft x w x 2 t dx rn tu t a n t s l t a w 2 t dx and ln t rn a x nt st a u t x w x 2 t dx rn a u t n t s l t a w 2 t dx using 2 9 we observe that these expressions make sense by virtue of our qualitative assumptions on u and the fact that h t l rn qualitatively because the data h c 0 see remark 4 for each fixed t 0 and thereforew t l 2 rn again qualitatively note that kn t ln t rn u t nt s l t a w 2 t dx hence plugging this bound into the definition of and in turn into 5 11 it suffices to prove that 0 rn t u t t a w 2 t dxdt t f l rn h l 2 rn g l 2 rn 5 12 where t t n 1 nt s l t 20 note that the operator t defined in section 3 was exactly the same but with n 2 let pt be the nice approximation of the identity with a smooth compactly supported kernel introduced previously just as in section 3 we then write t a w 2 t x t a x ptw 2 t x rtw 2 t x where for a function f valued in cn 1 in particular for f w 2 t with t momentarily fixed we define rt f x t a f x t a x pt f x we first consider the contribution of t a x ptw 2 t x in 5 12 note that 1 q l q 0 q t u x t t a dxdt t 1 q l q 0 q t u x t 2 dxdt t 1 2 1 q l q 0 q t a 2 dxdt t 1 2 f l rn a l rn f l rn uniformly in q by 2 10 5 8 and ellipticity recall that w t v t h t so by carleson s lemma we have 0 rn t u x t t a x ptw 2 t x dxdt t f l rn n ptw 2 t l 1 rn f l rn n v l 2 n h l 2 f l rn h l 2 rn g l 2 rn as desired last we deal with the remainder term rt we begin by recording two facts for future reference the first entails precise quantitative dependence on the aperture of the cones used to define the non tangential maximal function n f l 2 n 2 n f l 2 5 13 for any f l 2 and 1 the proof can be found in fs lemma 1 p 166 the second indicates the off diagonal decay for t and hence for rt for every cube q and all t q rt f 12 j 1 q 2 jq 2 l 2 q 2 n j 22 j t 2 j q 2 n 2 f 2 l 2 2 j 1 q 2 jq j 1 5 14 for any f l 2 rn cn 1 for t the latter estimate is simply 2 11 for l in the lower half space with m n 1 as in section 3 where we considered the case n 2 see 3 12 above we may use 2 8 aaahk lemma 3 11 and the definition of pt to extend the estimate to rt which is 5 14 as in section 3 we may then define rt 1 as an element of l 2 loc where 1 denotes the n 1 n 1 identity matrix and by construction rt 1 0 as above let dk denote the grid of dyadic cubes on r n of length q 2 k let q dk suppose 21 that t 2 k 2 k 1 and for i 1 set w 2 iq 2 iq w 2 t for j 1 since t q we then have 2 j 1 q w x 2 t w 2 q 2 dx 1 2 2 j 1 q w x 2 t w 2 j 1 q 2 dx 1 2 j i 1 2 jn q w 2 i 1 q w 2 iq 2 1 2 2 j 2 j 1 q t xw x 2 t 2 dx 1 2 j i 1 2 j i n 22 i 2 i 1 q t xw x 2 t 2 dx 1 2 j 2 jn 2 2 j 2 j 1 q t xw x 2 t 2 dx 1 2 by poincare s inequality thus since rt 1 0 and t q we see from 5 14 that q rtw 2 t x 2 dx 1 2 q rt w 2 t x w 2 q 12 q dx 1 2 j 1 q rt w 2 t x w 2 q 12 j 1 q 2 jq dx 1 2 j 1 j 2 j n 1 2 j 1 q t xw x 2 t 2 dx 1 2 5 15 we shall now use the preceding estimate to establish the following claim define the conical square function aw x x y t rtw 2 t y 2 dydt tn 1 1 2 we then have aw l 1 rn g l 2 rn h l 2 rn 5 16 proof of claim using 5 15 we find that for some purely dimensional constant m aw x k q dk dist x q 2 k 1 2 k 1 2 k q rtw 2

1 2 thus to prove the claim it suffices to show that j 1 j 2 j n 1 rn x y m 2 j t t g 1 y t 2 g 2 y t 2 dydt tn 1 1 2 dx 9 t g 1 9 n g 2 l 2 rn 5 17 along with a similar estimate with the roles of g 1 and g 2 reversed since the roles of g 1 and g 2 are symmetrical we need only treat the version stated in 5 17 note that for x y m 2 jt we have g 2 y t n m 2 j g 2 x i e the non tangential maximal

theorem rn x y m 2 j t t g 1 y t 2 dydt tn 1 dx 0 rn t g 1 y t 2 t n x y m 2 j t dx dydt t 2 jn 9 t g 1 9 2 we now choose n n 2 to obtain 5 17 and hence the claim with 5 16 in hand and using the carleson measure estimate 5 8 we then obtain 1 2 c aw l 1 rn f l rn g l 2 rn h l 2 rn 5 18 we also claim that k 0 rn t u y t rtw 2 t y dydt t 1 2 c aw l 1 rn 5 19 momentarily taking 5 19 for granted we then immediately obtain the desired estimate 5 12 for the contribution of the rt term by combining 5 18 5 19 the conclusion of theorem 1 2 follows it remains only to discuss 5 19 in fact the latter is actually a classical estimate of fefferman see fs pp 148 149 but for the reader s convenience we shall reproduce the argument here to this end for 0 h set ahw x x y t h rtw 2 t y 2 dydt tn 1 1 2 ah
