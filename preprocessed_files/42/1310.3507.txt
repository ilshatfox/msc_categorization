negative locally finite densities on rd and let 1 p a sufficient condition for the norm estimate t f p w dx c p t w f p dx valid for all calder n zygmund operators t is that the condition below holds sup q a cube 1 p la q dx q 1 p la q dx q q 1 p w q q 1 p here a is young function with dual in the p rez class bp and the function t is increasing on 1 with t p dt t moreover a dual condition holds with the roles of the weights and lp indices reversed also holds this is an alternate version of a result of nazarov reznikov and volberg p 2 one with a simpler formulation and proof based upon stopping times 1 introduction our subject is the two weight theory for calder n zygmund operators to say that is a weight on rd means that it is a locally finite non negative borel measure throughout we further assume that is absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue measure dx x dx and we will not distinguish the density from the weight fix 1 p for which pairs of weights w and does the following hold for all calder n zygmund operators t 1 1 t f pw dx c p t w f p dx the precise definition for these and other terms will be given in the next section below we will write t f t f in the case that w x 0 a e and x w x 1 p so that w x 1 p x 1 p 1 where 1 1 p 1 p the necessary and sufficient condition is the famous muckenhoupt condition 1 2 w ap sup q w q q q q p 1 in the classical case

at early stages of the subject the question addressed here is what is the sharpest condition expressible in terms similar to the ap condition which is sufficient for the family of inequalities 1 1 there are many results in the literature which modify 1 2 by requiring slightly higher integrability conditions on the densities of the weights the sharpest of these conditions is the separated bump conjecture which arises from work of cruz uribe and p rez 6 7 and cruz uribe and reznikov and volberg 8 to set the stage for this condition observe that the ap condition can be rewritten as the pth power of sup q w 1 p lp q dx q 1 p lp q dx q the bump conditions in the two weight setting strengthen this condition by replacing the lp norms by stronger ones the strengthening is on the scale of orlicz spaces set f q q 1 q f dx which is just the average of f write f a q f la q dx q where a is a young function a 0 0 and la denotes the luxembourg norm associated to a and we have normalized lebesgue measure on q the dual young function to a is denoted by a we write a bp if a t tp dt t a typical example of function a t is just a bit smaller than tp for example tp log t 1 for 0 in which case f a q is just a bit smaller than f p 1 p q to put the main conjecture in context we recall the result of carlos p rez which is basic for us theorem a c p rez 19 suppose that a bp then there holds 1 3 sup q a cube 1 q f a q p f p moreover the condition a bp is necessary for the inequality above this has the following implication for weighted inequalities the theorem below from 19 gives the sharpest ap like sufficient conditions for the boundedness of the maximal function theorem b c p rez 19 suppose that 1 p and a bp assume the condition below involving the dual function a 1 4 w a p sup q a cube 1 p a q w 1 p q separated bumps and czos 3 then this maximal function inequality holds m f lp w f lp where m f sup q 1 q f q since a bp a must be a bit smaller than t p hence a must be a bit bigger than tp that is we will have 1 p a q 1 p q whence the condition 1 4 is stronger than the two weight ap condition it is known that the two weight ap condition only characterizes the weak type norm of the maximal function this theorem answers a question of cruz uribe and p rez 6 it was proved almost at the same time by nazarov reznikov and volberg 16 p 2 and by lerner 15 for all p theorem c let and w be two weights with densities and 1 p let a bp and b bp for all calder n zygmund operators t there holds 1 5 t l p lp w ct sup q 1 p a q w 1 p b q in the inequality above the bumps occur in the same product the logic of the two weight theory suggests that the bumps could appear individually cruz uribe and reznikov and volberg 8 identified this conjecture as conjecture 1 6 let and w be two weights with densities and 1 p let a bp and b bp for all calder n zygmund operators t there holds 1 7 t l p lp w ct w a p w b p f lp the constant ct is defined in 2 1 and the implied constant depends upon the choice of a b this has been difficult to verify the very interesting paper of nazarov reznikov and volberg 17 proves a certain version of the conjecture in the case of p 2 under an additional condition which they speculate is necessary the result below holds in all lp has fewer technical hypotheses and contains 17 theorem 1 8 let and w be two weights with densities and 1 p let a bp and b bp and let p p be two monotonic increasing functions on 1 which satisfy 1 p t p dt t 1 and similarly for p define 1 9 w a p p sup q a cube p 1 1 p a q 1 p q 1 p a q w 1 p q for any calder n zygmund operator there holds t l p lp w ct w a p p w b p p f lp the constant ct is defined in 2 1 4 michael t lacey compared to the condition in 1 7 the bound above penalizes the product 1 p a q w 1 p q by the additional term involving p now p t has to satisfy an integrability condition that requires it to be for example of the order of t log t 1 p log log t 1 p log log log t 1 p t 0 we prefer this formulation of the theorem since it requires fewer hypotheses than 17 in addition the extra hypothesis involving p and p enter the proof in transparent and seemingly unavoidable way see lemma 4 17 our approach can provide further insights into how to build counterexamples to conjecture 1 6 in light of the fact that the bellman approach followed in 8 is not reversible in the separated bump setting the study of bumped ap conditions have an extensive history within just the subject of weighted estimates for singular integrals related conditions have arisen in the spectral theory of schr dinger operators 2 and in the study of sarason s conjecture on the composition of toeplitz operators 21 25 the article of neugebauer 18 firmly introduced the subject into weighted estimates and p rez 19 20 promoted their fine study the reader is referred to 3 5 8 24 for more history on this subject more recent developments have been as follows the paper 8 raised as a conjecture the theorem proved above and established variants of the result where the a t were log bumps namely a t tp log e t 1 for 0 the papers of lerner 15 thm 1 5 and nazarov reznikov volberg 16 p 2 established theorem c the latter estimate is strictly stronger than 1 5 as an example of 1 7 shows variants of these results were proved in the setting of spaces of homogeneous type in 1 the next section collects standard aspects of the subject and can be referred back to as needed the proof of the main theorem is in 4 2 notation background constants are suppressed by a b it is meant that there is an absolute constant c so that a cb we say that k rd rd r is a calder n zygmund kernel if for some constants 0 and ck 0 and 0 1 such that these conditions hold for x x y rd k k x y 0 x y k x y ck x y d x y k x y k x y ck x x x y d if 2 x x x y and a fourth condition with the roles of the first and second coordinates of k x y reversed also holds these are typical conditions although in the first condition we have effectively truncated the kernel at the diagonal and infinity the effect of this is that we needn t be concerned with principal values separated bumps and czos 5 given a calder n zygmund kernel k as above we can define tf x k x y f y dy which is defined for all f l 2 and x rd we say that t is a calder n zygmund operator since it necessarily extends to a bounded operator on l 2 rd we define 2 1 ct ck t l 2 l 2 it is well known that t is also bounded on lp 1 p with norm controlled by ct to say that a 0 0 is a young function means that a 0 0 a 1 1 a is convex continuous increasing and a t t as t the luxembourg norm associated to a on a measure space x is given by f la x inf 0 x a f d 1 the infimum of the empty set is taken to be we most frequently work with young functions of the form a x of the form ctp t where 1 p and t is constant for 0 t 1 and t is slowly varying at infinity thus 2 t t 1 as t the dual to a is defined by a t t 0 a 1 s ds in this case note that 2 2 a t t 0 s s 1 p 1 ds tp t 1 p 1 this is also a young function and we will use the generalized h lder s inequality in the form below but note x must be a probability space 2 3 x f gd f la x g la x x 1 3 general considerations we use the following consequence of lerner s remarkable median inequality we say that t is a sparse operator if tf q q f q 1 q where q is a collection of dyadic cubes for which 3 1 q q q q q 1 2 we will also refer to q as sparse and will typically suppress the dependence of t on q trivially any subset of a sparse collection is sparse the definition of sparseness in 17 is a bit more general but this is not needed herein a sparse operator is bounded on all lp and in fact is a positive dyadic calder n zygmund operator and the class is sufficiently rich to capture the norm behavior of an arbitrary calder n zygmund operator which is the wonderful observation of andrei lerner 6 michael t lacey theorem d 14 thm 1 1 we have the equivalence sup t czo sup f lp 1 t f lp w sup t is sparse sup f lp 1 t f lp w we need this consequence of the two weight theory of e sawyer 23 a detailed study of the dyadic setting is in 12 and an efficient proof is given at the end of 11 theorem e 23 for a sparse operator t with sparse collection q the norm is approximately t l p lp w nq where nq is the best constant n in the inequalities 3 2 q 0 q q q q 0 q 1 q p dw n p q q 0 q 0 q q 0 q q q q 0 w q 1 q p d n p qw q 0 q 0 q 4 proof of main theorem we consider the first group of testing inequalities in 3 2 and the proof given will by duality apply to the second testing inequalities assume for the remainder of the argument that q 0 is a fixed cube q is a sparse collection of cubes contained in q 0 q contains q 0 in fact we strengthen the sparseness condition 3 1 to 4 1 q q q q q 10 p q q q this can be accomplished by dividing q meeting the condition 3 1 into a bounded number as a function of 1 p of subcollections set 4 2 q 1 p a q 1 p q 1 these are the ratios that appear in the argument of p t in addition we are free to assume that p t does not grow faster than a power of log t at infinity assume that for all q q 4 3 p q 1 p a q w 1 p q p q 0 1 p a q 0 w 1 p q 0 we will show that q 0 q q q 1 q p dw p q 0 this is enough to conclude the first of the two testing inequalities in 3 2 by a trivial summation of over a geometrically decreasing sequence of values separated bumps and czos 7 we invoke a version of the parallel corona originating in 13 also see the last page of 11 the first step is proceed to 3 2 by duality thus for g a non negative function in lp q 0 w we will bound the form 4 4 q q q w q g w q q q 0 1 p g lp w here g wq w q 1 q g w dx construct stopping data for g as follows for any cube q q set cht q to be the largest subcubes q q contained in q such that g wq 10 g w q then set t k 0 tk where t 0 q 0 and inductively tk 1 q tk cht q define for t t t t t cht t t it follows that w t 1 2 w t define gt g w t 1 t t cht t g wt 1 t let qt be the minimal element of t that contains q observe that if qt t then g wq gt w q moreover by the maximal function estimate t t g wt p w t g p lp w 4 5 the construction of stopping data for is not dual for any q q set chs q to the largest subcubes q q contained in q such that q 10 q or q t we restart the stopping cubes at each member of t then set s k 0 sk where s 0 q 0 and inductively sk 1 q sk chs q let q s be the minimal element of s that contains q this is then the basic estimate lemma 4 6 there holds uniformly in t t 4 7 q qt t q w q q q qt t 1 p p a q q 1 p w t 1 p proof of 4 4 denoting q qs qt observe that the left side of 4 4 is s s t t q q s t q w q g w q q 4 8 the average g wq gt w q we must have s t since t s but also we can restrict to st t for otherwise qt t therefore the sum above is dominated by 4 8 t t gt w q q qt t q w q q 8 michael t lacey t t gt w q q qt t 1 p p a q q 1 p w t 1 p here of course we have applied 4 7 apply h lder s inequality we have by sparseness and p rez maximal function estimate 1 3 q q 1 p p a q q q 0 sup q 1 p p a q 1 q dx q 0 recall that t s and on the other the estimate 4 5 the obstacle to an easy proof of 4 7 is that the cubes q q need not be w carleson we give the proof in three steps in which we sum only over certain cubes the first two are very easy write q 0 q 0 and inductively set qk 1 to be the maximal elements q q which are strictly contained in some q qk the basic fact a consequence of 4 1 is that for all k q qk 4 9 q qk j q q q 10 pj q j n we write it q k if for some integer t q and q t with q q k our first easy estimate is as follows we require that the average value of w is not too large in the sum below lemma 4 10 there holds uniformly in t t 4 11 q qt t w 1 p q 22 it q w 1 p t q w q q q qt t 1 p p a q q 1 p w t 1 p proof the restriction on w in the sum in 4 11 with the estimate 4 9 immediately imply that q qt t w 1 p q 22 it q w 1 p t w q w t use the inequality below a consequence of the generalized h lder s inequality 2 3 q w q 1 p a q 1 p a q w 1 p q w 1 p q 1 p a q w 1 p q 4 12 we ignore the term p q here thus we need only bound the restricted sum over q of the terms 1 p a q q 1 pw q 1 p it is clear that h lder s inequality completes the proof in our second easy estimate we impose the restriction that the average of has become rather small separated bumps and czos 9 lemma 4 13 there holds uniformly in t t 4 14 s s st t q qt s 1 p q 2 is q 2 1 p s q w q q s s st t 1 p p a q q 1 p w t 1 p proof the restriction on in the sum in 4 14 immediately imply that for each s q qs s 1 p q 2 is q 2 1 p s q 1 q s 1 s then estimate

the sequence of numbers s 1 s x is growing at least geometrically so that we can pass the pth power inside the sum continuing we note that as a consequence of 4 12 p sw s p s w s s p 1 p p a s s and this completes the proof again the role of p is ignored remark 4 16 the argument above pushing the pth power inside the sum in 4 15 is key it for instance encapsulates the proof of theorem b combine 1 3 with sawyer s two weight maximal function theorem 22 using the argument 4 15 to verify the testing condition but there is nothing quite so simple in the current setting the sparse operators are just a bit bigger than the maximal function nevertheless we want to appeal to an argument similar to 4 15 below to do so we will absolutely need a certain integrability condition on the function p t the third and decisive sum is over cubes complementary to the previous two lemma 4 17 there holds uniformly in t t 4 18 s s st t 3 q qs s q w q q q qt t 1 p a q q 1 p w t 1 p 10 michael t lacey above the superscript 3 on the second sum means that we sum over those q such that 4 19 w 1 p q 2 2 it q w 1 p t and 1 p q 2 is q 2 1 p s proof the role of p is now key the main point of the assumptions on the sum in this case is that the ratios q decrease at least geometrically holding the stopping parents fixed 4 20 q 2 it q 2 t q q qs s qt t indeed exploiting the definitions 4 2 4 3 and the conditions in 4 19 p q 1 1 p a q w 1 p q 4 3 q 1 p q w 1 p q 4 2 2 is q 2 2 it q q 1 p s w 1 p t 4 19 2 it q q 1 p s w 1 p t is q it q 2 it q q 1 p t w 1 p t construction of s 2 it q q t 1 p a t w 1 p t 4 2 2 it q q t p t 1 4 3 summarizing there holds 2 it q q t p q p t q t 2 since we assume that p t grows more slowly than a power of log at infinity this proves 4 20 the integrability condition on the function p is used this way by the monotonicity of p t the condition 1 t p dt t 1 and the geometric decay 4 20 we see that 4 21 s s st t 3 q qs s q p 1 q x 1 t x we will rely upon this estimate below which holds for all q q p q w q 1 p p a q 1 p p a q w q p q p 1 p p a q p q p 1 p p a q w q p q p 1 p p a q 4 22 now the proof can be completed we can estimate as below inserting q to the zero power and applying h lder s inequality lhs 4 18 t s s st t 3 q q s t q 1 1 q 1 q dw separated bumps and czos 11 w t 1 p t q qt t q p p q 1 q dw 1 p by 4 21 w t 1 p q qt t q p p q w q q 1 p w t 1 p q qt t 1 p p a q q 1 p by 4 22 this completes the proof 5 log and loglog bumps we illustrate the implications of our main theorem for certain borderline bumps by a log bump we mean function in bp of the form lp t t p log tp 1 p 1 0 t in this case it follows from 2 2 that the dual young function is lp t t p log t 1 p 1 throughout this section log t 1 max 0 log t by a log log bump we mean functions in bp of the form p t t p log t 1 log t 1 p 1 0 t p t t p log t 1 p 1 log log t 1 p 1 we show that all the log bumps fall under the scope of our main theorem and that log log bumps do as well provided the power on the bump is sufficiently large proposition 5 1 these two assertions hold 1 suppose that 0 and that and w are a pair of weights such that w lp p as defined in 1 4 then for t t 2 p we have w lp 2 p p where the latter expression is defined in 1 9 2 suppose that 0 and that and w are a pair of weights such that w p 1 p then set p t log t 1 p p we have w p p p p moreover in both cases 5 2 p t p dt t this relies upon the observations in 14 17 concerning self improvement of orlicz norms and we will specialize their more general considerations for the bump functions that we are interested 12 michael t lacey in write a t tp tp so that for u sufficiently large u logu 1 p 1 a lp logu 1 p 1 log logu 1 p 1 a p also for a cube q set dq 1 q x q x set b t t t we have lemma 5 3 with the notations just established there holds b q 0 dq dq 1 d proof both sides scale as a norm so assuming that b q 1 we have 1 1 q q a x dx 0 a t ddq t 0 t dq t dt by integration by parts now by chebyshceff dq t t 1 hence 1 0 dq t 1 dq t dt for the reverse inequality we need to see that dq t 1 dq t dt 1 and so we need only be concerned with those t for which dq t 1 c t but for appropriate c this would imply that dq t min 1 t 2 so the proof is finished definition 5 4 17 def 2 a function f is weakly concave on an interval i if there is a constant c 1 so that for any numbers x 1 xn i in its domain and 1 n 0 with n j 1 j 1 there holds f n j 1 jxn c n j 1 jf xn theorem f 17 thm 5 3 write b 0 t t 0 t and assume b 0 t b t t where t is decreasing with t t t weakly concave on 0 then b 0 q c b q b q q the proof of the theorem relies upon lemma 5 3 and a jensen inequality for weakly concave functions the constant in the jensen inequality depends upon the constant in weak convexity separated bumps and czos 13 proof we can assume that q 1 so that 0 dq d 1 there holds by lemma 5 3 b 0 q 0 dq 0 dq d 0 dq dq dq d 0 dq dq d t t t 0 dq dq d 0 dq dq d 0 dq dq d b q b q the first inequality is just hypothesis and the second inequality is the jensen inequaltiy which is an immediate corollary to weak concavity finally the expression is rewritten this proves the theorem proof of proposition 5 1 in the first case we have w lp p set b u u logu p 1 u 1 u 2 then set b 0 u b u logu and a 0 b 0 t p from the definitions a 0 t lp 2 and 1 p p a 0 q inf p 0 1 q q b 0 p 1 b 0 q b q b q q 5 5 the last line follows from the theorem f and the observation that t t t is weakly concave with p t p t 1 it follows from our assumptions that a 0 bp and moreover that 5 6 p t p 1 p p a 0 q w p p b q w p p 1 p p a q w p p w p lp p and this completes this case since the integral condition 5 2 becomes after a change of variables eu t p t p dt t e u 2 du in this case the assumption is w p 1 p recall that in this case we have p 1 t t p log tp 1 p 1 log log tp 1 p 1 1 14 michael t lacey set b u u logu 1 p 1 log logu 1 p 1 2 u logu 1 2 then b 0 u b u u and a 0 t b t p then a 0 bp the function t 7 t t is weakly concave one can consult 17 5 2 2 or alternatively check that is concave on c 0 for sufficiently large c 0 thus 5 5 continues to hold in this case with p t p t 1 the inequality 5 6 will continue to hold with obvious changes and the integral condition 5 2 holds since with the same exponential change of variables p t p dt t du u 1 2 references 1 t c anderson d cruz uribe and k moen logarithmic bump conditions for calder on
