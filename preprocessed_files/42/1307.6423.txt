ar x iv 1 30 7 64 23 v 1 m at h c a 2 4 ju l 20 13 a lower bound criterion for iterated commutators laurent dalenc 1 and stefanie petermichl 2 abstract we consider iterated commutators of multiplication by a symbol function b and smooth calderon zygmund operators described by fourier multipliers of homogeneity 0 we establish a criterion for a collection of symbols so that the corresponding calderon zyg mund operators characterize product bmo by means of iterated commutators we therefore extend in part the line of one parameter results following the work of uchiyama and li as well as the result in several parameters concerning commutators with riesz transforms by lacey petermichl pipher wick 1 introduction a classical result of nehari 20 shows that a hankel operator with antianalytic symbol b is bounded if and only if the symbol belongs to bmo this theorem has an equivalent formulation by means of commutators of a symbol function b and the hilbert transform as the latter are a combination of orthogonal hankel operators nehari s result leans on analytic structure in several crucial ways the classical factorization result for h 1 functions on the disk and the fact that the hilbert transform is a fourier projection operator the classical text of coifman rochberg and weiss 6 extended the one parameter theory to real analysis in the sense that the hilbert transforms were replaced by riesz transforms in their text they obtained sufficiency i e that a bmo symbol b yields an l 2 bounded com mutator for certain more general convolution type singular integral operators for necessity they showed that the collection of riesz transforms was representative enough this is quite natural in the view of the definition of h 1 requiring riesz transforms being back in l 1 as well as the fefferman stein decomposition of bmo using riesz kernels uchiyama 24 revisited said decomposition with a very technical but constructive proof it remarkably replaced the class of riesz transforms by more general classes of kernel operators obeying a certain point separation criterion for their fourier multiplier symbols see also 23 and 22 for more natural questions in this direction li 17 used a criterion similar to uchiyama s to show that it was also a sufficiently representative class to characterize bmo by means of commutators 1 research supported in part by an anr grant 2 research supported in part by anr grant the author is a junior member of iuf 1 http arxiv org abs 1307 6423 v 1 2 l dalenc and s petermichl all of these results date back to the 70 s 80 s and 90 s and consider h 1 spaces in one parameter and simple i e non iterated commutators it is well known that the product theory and with it the product bmo space as identified by chang and fefferman 3 4 have more complicated structure we remind of carleson s interesting example 2 illustrating this difference the techniques to tackle the analogs of the above questions in several parameters are very different and have brought with the works of lacey and his collaborators valuable new insight and use to existing theories for example in the interpretation of journe s lemma in combination with carleson s example ferguson and lacey proved in 10 that the iterated commutator of the hilbert transform and multiplication by a symbol b characterize bmo and with it they proved the equivalent weak factorization result for h 1 on the bidisk lacey and terwilliger extended this result to an arbitrary number of iterates in 16 requiring thus among others a refinement of pipher s iterated multi parameter version of journe s lemma the real variable analog the result of coifman rochberg and weiss 6 using riesz transforms instead of hilbert transforms was extended to the multi parameter setting in 14 in this current paper we extend in part the direction of uchiyama and lee to several parameters we formulate a sufficient condition on a family of czos so that their iterated commutators characterize bmo for vectors d d 1 dt n t we consider product spaces r d rd 1 rdt for each 1 s t we have a collection of calderon zygmund operators ts ts 1 ts ns whose kernels are homogeneous of degree ds with fourier multiplier symbols represented by s ks c sds 1 that are in turn homogeneous of degree 0 for appropriate functions f and symbols b we consider the family of iterated commutators c k b t 1 k 1 tt kt mb here 1 s t k k 1 kt 0 ks ns and ts ks denotes the ksth choice of czo in the family ts acting in the sth variable we impose the following restrictions on the classes ts for each parameter s separately easiest formulated in terms of their symbols x 6 y sds 1 s i so that s i x 6 s i y full point separation on the sphere x sds 1 t tangent tosds 1 in x i so that s i t x 6 0 existence of non trivial tangential derivatives in the case that the kernels k are not real valued it appears that a last condition is needed a lower bound criterion for iterated commutators 3 s is closed under complex conjugation infinite sets ts are also included in our theorem at no additional cost example it is easy to check that the family of riesz transforms in rds satisfies these prop erties example it is also not hard to check that the family of all rotations of any one smooth dilation and translation invariant czo t with a discontinuity in 0 of its symbol in any given direction has these properties precisely we mean an operator t that has a smooth symbol m that is homogeneous of degree zero with the property that there exists sds 1 such that m 6 m or more generally even any non constant symbol m notice that in many cases such as when we choose t to be the first riesz transform a small number of rotations are sufficient to make up a family with the required properties theorem 1 1 under the conditions above on the classes ts there exist constants c 1 c 2 0 so that b bmo r d c 1 b bmo sup 0 ks ns t 1 k 1 tt kt mb 2 c 2 b bmo where we mean the product bmo norm according to chang and fefferman ts ks denotes the ksth choice of czo in the family ts acting in the sth variable it is well known that theorems of this form have an equivalent formulation in the language of weak factorization of hardy spaces for k a vector with 1 ks ds and 1 s t let us denote by k the bilinear operator obtained by unwinding the commutator c k b f g l 2 b k f g l 2 the operator k can be expressed as linear combination of iterates of czos ts ks and their adjoints applied to f g using the notation f l 2 l 2 inf k j k j 2 k j 2 where the infimum runs over all possible decompositions of f k j k k j k j with the help of the relevant commutator theorem it is an exercise in duality to see the following theorem 1 2 we have h 1 r d l 2 l 2 for any f h 1 r d there exist sequences k j k j l 2 such that f k j k j j k j with f h 1 k j k j 2 k j 2 in this text we prefer the language of commutators in terms of upper sufficiency and lower necessity bounds 4 l dalenc and s petermichl our proof follows the machinery developed by lacey and collaborators in 10 16 14 in particular we refine a strategy from 14 to pass from the complex variable case and the hilbert transform to the real variable and riesz transform case the fourier multipliers of the riesz transforms are very special monomials on the sphere we establish such a passage for much more general multiplier operators it seems not possible to use any previously proved characterization theorems directly we can however reuse some of the general strategy and in particular we manage to black box the very technical wavelet support and paraproduct estimates found in different versions in previous works in 14 this part appears to be the most streamlined and is general enough to apply to our situation 2 a brief review of multi parameter theory 2 1 wavelets in higher dimensions and several parameters we will use the fol lowing dilation and translation operators on rd tryf x f x y y r d 2 1 dila p f x a d pf x a a 0 0 p 2 2 these will also be applied to sets in an obvious fashion in the case of p by the d dimensional dyadic grid in rd we mean the collection of cubes dd j 2 k 0 2 k d j zd k z an elementary example of a wavelet system is the haar system generated by h 1 0 1 2 1 1 2 1 and w 1 0 1 the principle requirement is that the functions trc i dil 2 i w i d 1 form an orthonormal basis for l 2 r the wavelet in this text should be thought of meyer wavelet though due to its extra ordinary fourier support properties although not explicit in this text we borrow certain technical estimates that make decisive use of this feature of the meyer wavelet for 0 1 set w 0 w and w 1 w the superscript 0 denoting that the function has mean 0 while a superscript 1 denotes that the function is an l 2 normalized indicator function in one dimension for an interval i set w i trc i dil 2 i w multiresolution wavelets such as the haar or the meyer wavelet have the useful identity 2 3 i j f wi wi f w 1 j w 1 j a lower bound criterion for iterated commutators 5 the passage from r to rd consists of a product of d wavelets associated to intervals of the same size so that the resulting wavelet is associated to a cube let d 0 1 d 1 which we refer to as signatures in d dimensions for a cube q with side i i e q i 1 id and a choice of d set w q x 1 xd d j 1 w j ij xj it is then the case that the collection of functions waveletdd w q q dd d form a wavelet basis for lp rd for any choice of d dimensional dyadic grid dd here we are using the notation 1 1 1 the passage to the tensor product setting r d rd 1 rdt consists of a product of t wavelets associated to cubes of possibly different size so that the resulting wavelet is associated to a rectangle for a vector d d 1 dt and 1 s t let dds be a choice of ds dimensional dyadic grid and let d d t s 1 dds also let d 1 t s ds note that each s is a vector and so is a vector of vectors for a rectangle r q 1 qt being a product of cubes of possibly different dimensions and a choice of vectors d set w r x 1 xt t s 1 w sqs xs these are the appropriate functions and bases to analyze multiparameter paraproducts and commutators so the collection of wavalets associated to a dyadic grid in the product setting d d is w r r d d d this is a basis in lp r d 2 2 chang fefferman bmo let us describe product hardy space theory by this we mean the hardy spaces associated with domains like ts 1 r ds 6 l dalenc and s petermichl the hardy space h 1 rd denotes the class of functions with the norm d j 0 rjf 1 where rj denotes the jth riesz transform we adopt the convention that r 0 the 0 th riesz transform is the identity this space is invariant under the one parameter family of isotropic dilations while h 1 r d is invariant under dilations of each coordinate separately this in variance under a t parameter family of dilations gave rise to the term multi parameter theory the product space h 1 r d has a variety of equivalent norms in terms of square functions strong maximal functions and riesz transforms the dual of the real hardy space is h 1 r d bmo r d the t fold product bmo space it is a theorem of chang and fefferman 4 that this space has a characterization in terms of a product carleson measure define 2 4 b bmo r d sup u r d u 1 r u d b w r 2 1 2 here the supremum is taken over all open subsets u r d with finite measure and we use a wavelet basis w r theorem 2 5 chang fefferman we have the equivalence of norms b h 1 r d b bmo r d that is bmo r d is the dual to h 1 r d notice that this space bmo is invariant under a t parameter family of dilations here the dilations are isotropic in each parameter separately this fact is also represented by the choice of our wavelet system 2 3 journe s lemma notice that the supremum in the wavelet definition of bmo runs over open sets of finite measure this supremum restricted just to rectangles gives the definition of the larger rectangular bmo there is a substantial geometric difference the maximal dyadic sub rectangles of any arbitrary rectangle are disjoint while those maximal dyadic sub rectangles in open sets are not necessarily comparable by inclusion it is in part due to this difference that in the same way as in 10 a geometric lemma by journe 13 a lower bound criterion for iterated commutators 7 involving rectangles in the plane particularly useful in handling collections of rectangles not comparable by inclusion comes into play it was first observed by ferguson and lacey that journe s lemma could be improved to partially compare rectangular bmo and product bmo of two parameters a n dimensional version of journe s original lemma is due to pipher 21 and makes use of iterations this is the reason why we are going to have to replace the rectangular bmo space by another version of bmo that allows us to induct on the number of parameters in our commutator and therefore make use of the iterated nature of journe s lemma in more than two parameters this idea was first used in 16 say that a collection of rectangles u d d has t 1 parameters if and only if there is a choice of coordinate s so that for all r r u we have qs q s that is the sth coordinate of the rectangles are all one fixed ds dimensional cube we then define f bmo 1 r d sup u has t 1 parameters sh u 1 r u f w r 2 1 2 in this notation a collection of rectangles has a shadow given by sh u r r u the 1 subscript is used to indicate that we have reduced by one parameter in the definition the reader may be more familiar with the rectangular bmo space mentioned above in two parameters the space bmo 1 is larger than rectangular bmo carleson produced examples of functions which acted as linear functionals on h 1 r d with norm one yet had arbitrarily small rectangular bmo norm and hence arbitrarily small bmo 1 norm here is the precise version of the above mentioned refinement of journe s lemma it permits us with certain restrictions and by inducing a damping factor to control the bmo norm by the bmo 1 norm lemma 2 6 let u be a collection of rectangles of finite shadow for any a 0 we can construct v sh u together with a function e u 1 so that e r r v for all r u v 1 a sh u and last that r u e r c b w r w r bmo ka b bmo 1 here c depends only on d and ka on a and d a good and more complete reference on the subject is 1 8 l dalenc and s petermichl 2 4 remarks on the upper bound we are going to assume that k is a smooth caldero n zygmund convolution kernel on rd rd this means that the kernel is a dis tribution that satisfies the estimates below for x 6 y jk y n y d j j 0 1 2 d 1 k l n 2 7 the first estimate combines the standard size and smoothness estimate the last assumption is equivalent to assuming that the operator defined on schwartz functions by tk f x def k x y f y dy extends to a bounded operator on l 2 rd if k 1 kt is a sequence of caldero n zygmund kernels with ks defined on r ds rds it is not obvious that the corresponding tensor product operator tk 1 tkt is a bounded operator on lp r d this is a consequence of multi parameter caldero n zygmund theory by 14 theorem 5 3 multi parameter commutators are bounded operators if the symbol belongs to bmo theorem 2 8 for 1 p 2 9 tk 1 tkt mb p p b bmo by bmo we mean chang fefferman bmo the implied constant depends upon the vector d and the tks the calderon zygmund operators we are concerned about in this text are assumed to have infinite smoothness in the sense of the estimates on the kernel in 2 7 and are therefore included in the result above the rest of the paper is dedicated to establishing a lower estimate of our commutators by means of product bmo we are going to follow the iteration strategy in 10 16 14 the one dimensional case is very special the hilbert transform is both calderon zygmund as well as half space fourier projection operator we have lost this feature in higher dimensions but it motivates the use of czos close to projection operators such as in 14 3 cone operators in dimension d 2 a cone c rd is given by the data q where rd is the direction of the cone and the cube q centered at the origin is its aperture the cone consists of a lower bound criterion for iterated commutators 9 all vectors that take the form where and q by c we mean the dilated cone with data q given a cone c we consider its fourier projection operator defined via p cf 1 c f due to the fact that the apertures are cubes such operators are combinations of fourier projections onto half spaces and as such admit uniform lp bounds for a given cone d we consider a smooth calderon zygmund operator td with a kernel kd whose fourier symbol k d c and satisfies the estimate 1 d 6 k d 6 1 1 d remark the derivatives of the symbols k d increase with the aperture of the cones in the course of the proof it will be important that the lp bounds of operators td do not grow with the aperture of the cones we thank the special nature of the cone operators and their closeness to half plane projections for this fact by a rotation argument we may assume that the cone d has direction x 1 there exists a smoothed symbol m of the sort described so that higher derivatives in consecutive directions x 2 xn are controlled independently of the aperture in the remaining variable x 1 the derivatives grow with the aperture but we control total variation of the derivatives in x 2 xn in doing so and carefully reading the marcinkiewicz multiplier theorem it provides us with lp bounds independent of the aperture the details are left to the interested reader we refer to 12 page 363 for a detailed statement of this theorem 3 1 selection of a representative class of cones following the idea in 14 we select classes of cones that are going to give us a certain auxiliary lower bound we felt the need to refine this process which is necessary due to the fact that we consider more general classes of czos instead of just the class of riesz transforms let b be our bmo function that we normalize to have norm 1 let u be the open set that gives us the supremum in the bmo norm of b and denote by u the collection of rectangles r u let us renormalize by an appropriate dilation the size of the set sh u to be comparable to 1 let pub the wavelet projection onto those wavelets adapted to rectangles in the class u given a cone c with data q we denote by hc the half plane projection that corre sponds to the direction the convolution operator whose symbol is 0 recall that tc denotes the czo adapted to the cone and pc the fourier projection associated to the cone given a vector of cones c cs 1 s t we denote by h c t c p c their tensor products lemma 3 1 let b be the set of all bmo functions normalized as above for all such b let u u be as above for any 0 we can select a finite set of pairs d c of vectors of cones d ds 1 s t where ds r ds with data s qs and cs r ds 1 s t with data s q s so that for each there is a pair d c with the following properties 1 ds cs 10 l dalenc and s petermichl 2 t d 2 4 t 3 h d t d 4 4 h c p c t d 2 2 proof we first select a finite collection of cones ds let us for the moment fix b let be a small positive number to be determined later it will be in relation with the aperture of the cones given the aperture qs is chosen large enough so that p ds s ds 1 sds 1 1 2 we consider random rotations d ss of ds and write d for component wise independent rotation averaging the l 2 norms gives us e p d 2 2 e d 2 d 1 2 t as well as e h d p d 2 2 t notice that for all choices of we have 0 t d 2 1 as well as 0 h d t d 2 1 together this provides us with the estimates p t d 2 4 t 4 t 1 2 t 1 4 t 1 and p h d t d 2 t t 2 since lim 0 4 t 1 2 t 1 4 t 1 1 2 t 1 and lim 0 1 t 2 1 the sum of the above probabilities exceeds 1 for small enough in this case we are sure to be able to select directions so that t d 2 4 t and h d t d 2 t 2 we have half plane projection operators hd and czos td that have according to remark 3 above uniform lp bounds also remember that is normalized in l 2 as well as in bmo we therefore have uniform l 8 bounds h d t d 8 k where the constant k neither depends on the aperture nor the direction of the cones a lower bound criterion for iterated commutators 11 by interpolation we get h d t d 4 t 6 we choose small enough so that both the above inequalities hold as well as t 6 we have seen that there exists a fixed so that for each b the set b sd 1 of admissible directions is not empty notice that b b 2 furthermore there exists r so that the ball b r sd 1 b 2 for all b so by increasing the aperture a dense enough finite sample set of directions will therefore provide an admissible direction for all appropriately normalized bmo functions b we turn to the selection of cones cs keeping in mind that cones ds have already been chosen due to uniform l 4 estimates of t d we see that 2 2 k for some universal k so in particular for any vector of cones c we have h c p c 2 2 k take 2 a small positive number choosing the aperture of the cones cs large enough so that p cs s ds 1 sds 1 1 2 gives us the estimate e h c p c 2 2 k t similarly to above p h c p c 2 2 k t 2 t 2 ifds s qs let e s be the hyperplane perpendicular to s andh s the corresponding half space that contains ds let min 1 2 1 ds 2 e s where denotes the angle between vectors no tice that only depends upon consider now the circular cone a s s 4 there exists a fixed larger aperture q s only depending on so that q s s qs whenever d s we are free to choose small enough so that p a s s ds 1 sds 1 1 2 as well as k t 2 since p h c p c 2 2 k t 2 t 2 we are sure to find cs s q s with the required properties by slightly enlarging the aperture of cones cs and an argument similar to the one above we obtain a finite collection of cones cs with the required properties we form commutators using arbitrary cones cs s qs let us define b q sup tc 1 tct mb 2 2 12 l dalenc and s petermichl where the supremum is taken over all choices of cone transforms tcs t s qs in which the direction s varies and the aperture of the cone is fixed to be qs for each parameter s separately here tcs acts in the sth variable in 14 the following theorem was proven theorem 3 2 b q b bmo with constants depending upon the aperture of the cones we are going to need information that is somewhat more specific it is valuable to us to know for which test function depending on the symbol b the commutator becomes large lemma 3 3 if t d with cones d c chosen as in the lemma then tc 1 tct mb 2 1 the proof of a similar estimate is implicit in 14 section 7 although the cones in our text have somewhat different properties ds and cs do not necessarily share the same direction the pairs ds cs were chosen to enable the use of the proof in 14 we sketch the part of the proof that illustrates the special use of the cone operators let u be the supremal set in the definition of bmo and u the corresponding collection of dyadic rectangles with its shadow sh u journe s lemma provides us with a slightly larger set v let v r r v r 6 sh u let w denote the rest of the dyadic rectangles we first observe that with pub and t d we have tc 1 tct m 2 1 observe that the only non zero term in this commutator is tc 1 tct pub since any cone operator falling on is zero consider now the splitting t c h c t d i h c the last term is zero since i h c and are supported on the same half space away from the cones c the second term is small due to the choice of the cone in lemma 3 1 the first term is large and explains the motivation using cone transforms t c 2 h c 2 2 2 4 1 this follows as the fourier transform of is symmetric with respect to the half planes determined by the cones the last inequality uses the littlewood paley inequalities next we will see that tc 1 tct mpvb 2 1 4 j it is easy to see that tc 1 tct mpvb 2 pv b 4 4 pv b 4 where the implied constant depends upon the l 4 norms of the cone transforms but by journe s lemma we have that pv b 2 1 2 j pv b bmo 1 together they imply pv b 4 1 4 j a lower bound criterion for iterated commutators 13 for the technical estimate of the last term as well as a more detailed exposition we refer to 14 section 7 proof of 7 9 we gather the information and are left with the following theorem 3 4 for each parameter s there exists a finite collection cs of cones cs ks ks qs with 1 6 ks 6 ns of fixed aperture qs so that b bmo sup tc 1 k 1 tct kt mb 2 2 b bmo for all bmo functions b here the supremum runs over all cs ks cs it will be essential for us to approximate symbols of cone operators using polynomials in members of our given collections of symbols 3 2 approximation of cones via the family for a fixed parameter given our family we wish to approximate the symbol of cone projection operators by means of polynomials in i for technical reasons we need a very good approximation that controls also the supremum norm of derivatives of the symbols say of order d nachbin s beautiful theorem 19 allows us under certain conditions on the family to do so we state it in the form we are going to need it theorem 3 5 let m be a compact smooth manifold let b be a closed real subalgebra of a cm m m where m is the topology induced by the norm of uniform convergence in cm then b a if and only if b contains the function 1 x 6 y m f b such that f x 6 f y and for every x m and 0 6 v tx m there exists f bsuch that df x v 6 0 it is not hard to check that under the additional assumtion that b be closed under complex conjugation there is a complex version lemma 3 6 for a given d dimensional pair of cones d and c as in lemma 3 1 let h c h d denote the opposing half spaces respectively choose a function hc d c d sd 1 with values between 0 and 1 such that hc d 1 c hc d 0 h c h d given any small 0 there exists an operator fd c with symbol vd c that is a polynomial in so that vd c hd c d where d is the norm of uniform convergence in cd we have universal lp estimates for the associated kernel operators fd c fd c p kp where this constant is independent of the choice of the cone and universal for small 14 l dalenc and s petermichl proof thanks to our assumptions the part concerning the approximations is almost clear just observe that we may add the identity operator i with multiplier 1 to our collection that is the collection characterizes bmo if and only if 1 does in the case that the kernels are real valued we did not assume that be closed under complex conjugation in this case consider characterizes bmo if and only if does observe that if t denotes the czo associated to the symbol then t t observe also that t b t b if the kernel k x of t is real then k x is the kernel of t it is easy to verify that t 1 t 2 b f t 1 t 2 b f here f x y f x y so f has a sign change in the second set of variables its obvious generalization holds when more iterates and adjoints are present the bmo and l 2 norms are preserved under these reflections it remains the important point of universal lp estimates thanks to the control on the derivatives granted to us by nachbin s theorem we may apply a standard multiplier theorem 12 page to obtain uniform lp bounds 4 lower bound czo we induct on the number t of parameters that is the number of coordinates in d d 1 dt we assume that ds 2 for all s the case when ds 1 for some s reduces our choices of admissible operators to the hilbert transform this case is easier and merely complicates notation for us the base case t 1 of our induction argument is stronger than what we need and a theorem by li theorem 4 1 let t be a collection of czos where the following restriction is imposed the symbols of the ti t satisfy i x i x 6 0 for all x s d 1 in the case of t 1 for all d 2 and symbols b on rd we have b bmo sup 16 k 6 n mb tk 2 2 here tk denotes the kth choice of czo in the family t we are also going to need the following weaker lower bound in terms of the bmo 1 norm in terms of iterated commutators using our families of czos lemma 4 2 let t 2 given classes ts of czos with the class of their symbols s assume that for each parameter 1 6 s 6 t separately we have 1 x 6 y sds 1 s i so that s i x 6 s i y a lower bound criterion for iterated commutators 15 2 x sds 1 t tangent tosds 1 in x i so that s i t x 6 0 and assume that under these same conditions the lower bound holds in the case of t 1 parameters in terms of product bmo then we have the estimate b bmo 1 sup k c k b 2 2 where c k b t 1 k 1 tt kt mb here 1 s t k k 1 kt 0 ks ns and ts ks denotes the ksth choice of czo in the family ts acting in the sth variable the proof uses a well established equivalent formulation of commutator estimates and weak factorization this argument goes back to ferguson and sadosky 11 our case is closest to the proof of lemma 6 3 in 14 replacing the collection of riesz transforms by our families ts we include a sketch for the sake of completeness we assume that t 2 and use the induction hypothesis to establish a lower bound in terms of our bmo norm with t 1 parameters proof it is sufficient to demonstrate that the following inequality holds 4 3 b l 2 l 2 b bmo 1 and this will be established inducting on the number of parameters assume the truth of the theorem in t 1 parameters given a smooth symbol b x 1 xt b x 1 x of t parameters we assume that b bmo 1 1 assume the supremum is achieved by the collection u of d d of t 1 parameters say that the rectangles in u agree in the first coordinate to a fixed cube q rd 1 after normalization assume that q 1 and sh u 1 then define r u sig d b w r w r note that b 1 to prove the claim it is then enough to prove that l 2 r d l 2 r d 1 observe that x 1 x 1 x and 1 h 1 rd 1 with 1 h 1 rd 1 1 to 1 apply the one parameter weak factorization of h 1 rd 1 resulting from the one parameter characterization result of li there exists functions f jn g j n l 2 rd 1 n n 1 j 1 d 1 such that 1 n 1 d 1 j 1 1 1 j 1 f j 1 n g j 1 n 16 l dalenc and s petermichl where 1 j 1 p q t 1 j 1 p q pt 1 j 1 q one next sees that h 1 tl 2 r dl with norm controlled by a constant by the induction hypothesis in t 1 parameters in particular that h 1 tl 2 r dl l 2 ts 2 r ds l 2 ts 2 r ds we have f j m g j m l 2 ts 2 r ns with m n and j a vector with 1 js ds for s 2 t such that m 1 j j f j m g j m m 1 j f j m 2 g j m 2 1 this immediately implies 4 3 since 1 and we have a weak factorization of with l 2 r d l 2 r d 1 we now turn to the induction step in the main theorem to finish the proof of the lower estimate in terms of bmo in t parameters proof we start with any bmo function b so that b bmo 1 1 is small notice that we have no loss of generality here due to lemma 4 2 we already have a lower bound for such b where b bmo 1 1 we normalize the function b as before find the function and obtain cones ds the function and cones cs according to lemma 3 1 for a small positive number to be chosen that determines the precision with which we approximate the cone transforms tcs obtain operators ts polynomials in 1 we are going to see that indeed the estimate t 1 tt mb 2 1 holds the commutator consists of terms of the form t t where t t are combinations of ts and the identity in the case where t is not the identity it follows from lemma 3 2 that the symbol of t is at most on the fourier support of such components are small t t 2 t 2 4 t 4 1 3 to obtain the last inequality we observe the following first recall that is normalized both in bmo and l 2 by interpolation we control l 4 norms uniformly observe also that t is at most on the fourier support of which gives us t 2 in addition t has universal l 8 norms independent of it is here that we use good approximation of the symbol controlling all derivatives it remains to interpolate to obtain the estimate above now we are left with term t t 1 tt which we estimate as follows remember that t d and write h d t d i h d thus obtaining three terms we will see that only one of them is large a lower bound criterion for iterated commutators 17 the functions i h d and are supported on the same product of half spaces comple mentary to cones ds we know that the symbol cd c vanishes and therefore the ts are at most so t i h d 2 6 i h d 2 6 i h d 4 4 recall the compositions of half plane projection operators have uniform lp bounds and that l 4 norms of both and are controlled for the part t h d t d we rely on the estimate from lemma 3 1 of the l 4 norm t h d t d 2 h d t d 2 6 4 for the term t we consider t 2 h c 2 6 t h c 2 6 t t c 2 t c h c 2 since is real with symmetric fourier transform we have h c 2 2 2 4 furthermore 24 r u wr 2 r 1 r 1 2 2 4 r u wr 2 r 1 r 1 2 2 2 1 the first inequality uses a littlewood paley inequality and to see the second inequality note that the rectangles in u are contained in a set of measure bounded by 1 we have therefore proved that t 2 1 we wish to prove that commutators that arise with our czos themselves are large not just specific polynomials in those operators to do so observe the following elementary fact let t t be czo s then tt mb t t mb t mb t if the symbols of ts and t s are polynomials in the s it follows that for some choice of operators associated to s t 1 k 1 tt kt 2 1 where is of the form t and where t is a composition of operators ts ls notice here that it is essential that we only approximate a finite set of cone operators so that we control degrees and coefficients of the arising polynomials this point is imperative since we do not control degree or coefficients with nachbin s approximation recall that pub and that all dyadic rectangles are split into three groups u v w in order to see that the norm of the commutator satisfies t 1 k 1 tt kt b 2 2 1 we use test function and split the estimate according to partial sums of the symbol b of only those rectangles belonging to classes u v w respectively we have already seen that t 1 k 1 tt kt pub 2 1 18 l dalenc and s petermichl it remains to see that the remaining parts are small we are going to see that t 1 k 1 tt kt pvb 2 1 4 j the part of the estimate responsive to journee s lemma and also that t 1 k 1 tt kt pwb 2 1 for these two estimates we can follow directly the arguments in lppw the first estimate illustrates the use of journe s lemma in this context we do not need to use any cancellation of the commutator t 1 k 1 tt kt pvb 2 pvb 4 4 where the implied constant depends upon l 2 and l 4 operator norms of the ts ks the l 4 norm of is uniformly controlled and by construction we have pvb bmo 6 1 last journe s lemma provides us with the estimate pvb 2 2 6 j interpolation then gives pvb 4 1 4 j the last estimate requires a careful analysis but does not use the specifics of our operators except the control on a large number of derivatives of the kernel we therefore appeal to the version in lppw where the estimate was stated for riesz transforms but in fact carried out for more general czos with control on a large number of derivatives such as the ones we have here 5 concluding remarks remark our theorem is a generalization of the riesz transform case but it falls short of recovering the full uchiyama li criterion in several parameters li s criterion only requires point separation of all pairs and on the sphere this criterion is quite natural as it makes sure there is an operator in the family that has a singularity in a given direction for all directions due to the method of proof we felt the need to require point separation for all pairs of points as well as a derivative condition the strategy to obtain lower bounds in this multi parameter setting remains analytic in nature while we are not able to use fourier projections directly as in one dimension we build operators that are close enough to still pretend we are in the one dimensional setting families that have li s criterion are not enough to approximate the operators we need in the norm of uniform convergence in c sd 1 much less in cn sd 1 we require the latter because we need excellent convergence of multiplier symbols on the fourier transform side in order to draw meaningful conclusions it is interesting to remark that in cases like ours one easily proves a version of stone weierstrass theorem that can handle defects in the sense that it is clear which algebra is generated by a family of functions with defects such as a lack of point separation for a given pair of and insd 1 one uses factor spaces to see that the generated algebra will have the exact a lower bound criterion for iterated commutators 19 same set of defects the algebra generated by a family that lacks point separation for a set of pairs will be the subalgebra with that same property the situation is not so simple if one needs uniform approximation in cn sd 1 due to the necessary conditions on the tangential derivatives the situation becomes very complex when the family has defects such as a lack of point separation in just one point or the lack of non zero tangential derivatives the corresponding subalgebras are unknown since the 1950 s references 1 carlos cabrelli michael lacey ursula molter and jill pipher variations on
