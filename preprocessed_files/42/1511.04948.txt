valued estimates in harmonic analysis which we like to call the helicoidal method as a consequence of it we are able to give affirmative answers to several questions that have been circulating for some time in particular we show that the tensor product bht between the bilinear hilbert transform bht and a paraproduct satisfies the same lp estimates as the bht itself solving completely a problem introduced in mptt 04 then we prove that for locally l 2 exponents the corresponding vector valued bht satisfies again the same lp estimates as the bht itself before the present work there was not even a single example of such exponents finally we prove a bi parameter leibniz rule in mixed norm lp spaces answering a question of kenig in nonlinear dispersive pde 1 introduction vector valued estimates for classical caldero n zygmund operators are known from the work of burkholder bou 83 benedek caldero n and panzone bcp 62 rubio de francia ruiz and torrea rdfrt 86 to mention a few a customary way of proving such vector valued estimates is through weighted norm inequalities and extrapolation as explained in gcf 85 initially the vector valued approach unified the existing theory for maximal operators square functions and singular integrals later on the setting was generalized to banach spaces which have unconditional martingale difference property and it was shown by bourgain bou 86 that this is in fact a necessary condition for this theory for bilinear operators however the theory is far from being fully understood even in the scalar case in this paper we study vector valued estimates for the bilinear hilbert transform and for paraproducts our initial motivation was an akns system related problem which can be reduced to understanding a rubio de francia operator for iterated fourier integrals because of the specific nature of this question our general approach is concrete rather than abstract as much as possible the present article is aiming to be self contained central to time frequency analysis is the bilinear hilbert transform operator defined by bht f g x p v r f x t g x t dt t this operator was first introduced by caldero n in connection with his work on the cauchy integral on lipschitz curves lp estimates for bht were proved nearly thirty years later by lacey and thiele without establishing the optimality of the range the author is also a member of the simion stoilow institute of mathematics of the romanian academy 1 http arxiv org abs 1511 04948 v 2 2 cristina benea and camil muscalu theorem 1 m lacey c thiele lt 99 bht is a bounded bilinear

set of triples p q s satisfying the conditions above the question that remains open is whether the bilinear hilbert transform is bounded also for s 1 2 2 3 the ho lder type condition 1 p 1 q 1 s reflects the scaling invariance of the operator and it can be reformulated as 1 p 1 q 1 s 1 where s is the conjugate exponent of s thus a triple p q s range bht if 1 p 1 q 1 s lies in the plane x y z

method of the proof which breaks down when 1 p 1 q 3 2 consists in approximating bht by a model operator obtained through a whitney decomposition of the frequency region morally speaking this model operator is a superposition of almost orthogonal objects of a lower complexity called discretized paraproducts paraproducts play an important role on their own especially in the analysis of pde a paraproduct is an expression of the form 2 f g 7 r r f x t g x s k s t dsdt where k s t is a caldero n zygmund kernel in the plane r 2 alternatively a paraproduct can be regarded as a bilinear multiplier operator f g 7 r 2 m f g e 2 ix d d where m is a classical marcinkiewicz mikhlin ho rmander multiplier in two variables suf ficiently smooth away from the origin the singularity of the multiplier m consists of one multiple vector valued inequalities via the helicoidal method 3 point 0 0 on the other hand we can see from 1 that the bht multiplier is singular along the line we have the following result on paraproducts theorem 2 coifman meyer cm 97 any bilinear multiplier operator associated to a symbol m satisfying m for sufficiently many multi indices maps lp r lq r into ls r provided that 1 p q 1 2 s and 1 p 1 q 1 s following the presentation in ms 13 any bilinear operator of this form can be essentially written as a finite sum of paraproducts of the form i f g 7 k f k g

2 k 2 kx k x 2 k 2 kx 1 on 1 2 1 2 is supported on 1 1 and 2 the qk k represent littlewood paley projections onto the frequency 2 k while pk k are convolution operators associated with dyadic dilations of a nice bump function of integral 1 a classical application of theorem 2 is the following leibniz rule 3 d f g s d f p 1 g q 1 f p 2 d g q 2 which holds for any 0 as long as 1 pi 1 qi 1 s 1 pi qi and 1 1 s in particular if s 1 which is the case in most applications the leibniz rule holds for any 0 for functions on r 2 with fractional partial derivatives in both variables a correspond ing leibniz rule is d 1 d 2 f g s d 1 d 2 f p 1 g q 1 f p 2 d 1 d 2 g q 2 4 d 1 f p 3 d 2 g q 3 d 2 f p 4 d 1 g q 4 the proof of the above inequality relies on discrete biparameter paraproducts which are expressions of the form 5 k l f k l g k l k l x y in mptt 04 the following theorem was proved theorem 3 muscalu pipher thiele tao mptt 04 is a bounded operator from lp r 2 lq r 2 into ls r 2 provided that 1 p q 1 p 1 q 1 s and 0 s 4 cristina benea and camil muscalu this further implies that 4 is true whenever 1 pi 1 qi 1 s 1 pi qi and max 1 1 1 1 r if r 1 the last condition is redundant so 4 holds for any 0 related to this carlos kenig asked the following question that has been circulating for some time question 1 assuming that 1 s 1 s 2 and 0 is there a leibniz rule for mixed norm lp spaces of the form d 1 d 2 f g l s 1 x l s 2 y d 1 d 2 f l p 1 x l p 2 y g lq 1 x l q 2 y f lp 3 x l p 4 y d 1 d 2 g l q 3 x l q 4 y d 1 f l p 5 x l p 6 y d 2 g l q 5 x l q 6 y d 2 f l p 7 x l p 8 y d 1 g l q 7 x l q 8 y here the mixed norms are defined by 6 f l p xl q y f l q y l p x r r f x y qdy p q dx 1 p a result of a similar type appeared in kpv 93 as an important tool in establishing local well posedness for the generalized korteweg de vries equation this is a dispersive nonlinear equation given by 7 u t 3 u x 3 uk u x 0 t x r k z u x 0 u 0 x in order to prove existence the authors use the contraction principle but to be able to do so they need to construct a suitable banach space the norm of the banach space involves mixed lp norms of fractional derivatives in the first variable d 1 and the leibniz rule employed in this paper is 8 d 1 f g f d 1 g d 1 f g l p xl q t c d 11 f l p 1 x l q 1 t d 21 g l p 2 x l q 2 t here 0 1 1 2 and 1 p 1 1 p 2 1 p 1 q 1 1 q 2 1 q also p p 1 p 2 q q 1 q 2 1 but one can allow q 1 if 1 0 the fractional derivatives appear as a consequence of the smoothness requirement on the initial data u 0 is assumed to be in some sobolev space h r where depends on the value of k in 7 question 1 is an extension of 8 and we managed to provide an answer by proving estimates for in lp spaces with mixed norms bi parameter bilinear operators where first studied in jou 85 where journe is introduc ing a new way of generalizing caldero n zygmund operators on product spaces more ex actly it is proved in jou 85 that bi commutators of caldero n coifman type are bounded which translates to maps l 2 r 2 l r 2 into l 2 r 2 the full range of estimates for was established in mptt 04 where was also noticed that bht bht does not satisfy any lp estimates what remained undecided for some time was the following question question 2 does the tensor product bht satisfy any lp estimates would it be possible to prove it satisfies the same estimates as the bht itself multiple vector valued inequalities via the helicoidal method 5 some significant progress in answering this question was made by silva in sil 14 it was showed that bht maps lp lq into ls under the constraints that 1 p 2 q 2 and 1 q 2 p 2 our helicoidal method allows us to remove these restrictions proving in this way that bht satisfies indeed the same lp estimates as bht as it turned out the study of question 1 and question 2 is related to proving sometimes multiple vector valued inequalities for and bht let r r 1 r 2 r be a tuple so that 1 r 1 r 2 1 r and 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r we say that an inequality of the type 9 k bht fk gk r 1 r s k fk r 1 r 1 p k gk r 2 r 2 q represents lp estimates for vector valued bht corresponding to the exponent r in short we have lp estimates for bht r some lp estimates for vector valued bht have been proved recently by silva in sil 14 provided r 4 3 4 umd valued extensions for the quartile operator the fourier walsh analogue of bht were studied by hyto nen lacey and parissis in hlp 13 the results in hlp 13 transferred to the lp setting hold under the same constraint that r 4 3 4 moreover through this method it is impossible to obtain vector valued extensions when l 1 or l spaces are involved as these are not umd spaces a similar abstract approach was taken in dpo 15 where banach valued estimates for paraproducts were proved in spite of these results some important questions remained unsettled question 3 are there any exponents r as before for which the corresponding vector valued bht r satisfy the same l p estimates as the bht itself as the question suggests until the present work there was not even a single example of such an exponent we show that whenever r is in the local 2 range that is 0 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r 1 2 bht r satisfies the same l p estimates as the bht operator moreover whenever 2 p q lp estimates exist for any exponent r r 1 r 2 r to summarize the main task of the present work is to give affirmative answers to question 1 question 2 and question 3 described above in what follows we will present our main results sometimes in a more general setting theorem 4 for any 0 d 1 d 2 f g l s 1 x l s 2 y d 1 d 2 f l p 1 x l p 2 y g lq 1 x l q 2 y f lp 3 x l p 4 y d 1 d 2 g l q 3 x l q 4 y d 1 f l p 5 x l p 6 y d 2 g l q 5 x l q 6 y d 2 f l p 7 x l p 8 y d 1 g l q 7 x l q 8 y whenever 1 pj qj 1 2 s 1 1 s 2 with max 1 1 1 1 s 1 and so that the indices satisfy the natural ho lder type conditions this answers question 1 in the affirmative of course one may wonder if theorem 4 holds in arbitrary dimensions as the careful reader will notice our methods allow for such a generalization with the outer most lebesgue exponent possibly less than 1 if all the indices pi qi involved are strictly between 1 and however in applications l norms appear so it will be of interest to have a more general theorem for 1 pi qi 6 cristina benea and camil muscalu although we cannot obtain this result in this paper due to some delicate technical issues we plan to return to this problem sometimes in the future an n dimensional version of a leibniz rule was presented in tw 15 for indices that are again strictly between 1 and d 2 f g l s 1 x l s 2 y r rn d 2 f l p 1 x l p 2 y r rn g lq 1 x l q 2 y r rn f lp 1 x l p 2 y r rn d 2 g l q 1 x l q 2 y r rn this can be regarded as an n dimensional generalization of 8 and it is simpler than our variant of the leibniz rule because it doesn t require a multi parameter analysis our theorem 4 is a consequence modulo technical but classical complications of the following result theorem 5 mixed norm estimates for paraproducts on the bi disc let 1 pj qj 1 2 s 1 1 s 2 so that 1 pj 1 qj 1 sj 1 j 2 then f g l s 1 x l s 2 y f l p 1 x l p 2 y g l q 1 x l q 2 y the above theorem provides lp estimates for in mixed norm lp spaces through our methods we can also recover the results from mptt 06 stating that maps lp rn lq rn into ls rn whenever 1 p q 1 2 s and 1 p 1 q 1 s moreover we answer question 2 by proving that bht and bht n satisfy the same lp estimates as bht theorem 6 for any p q r with 1 p 1 q 1 r with 1 p q and 2 3 r bht f g lr rn 1 f lp rn 1 g lq rn 1 the same is true for bht for n 2 no such results were known previously and furthermore a new approach was necessary for n 3 this will be explained later in remark 3 some mixed norm lp estimates for bht and d 1 bht d 2 can be obtained which are similar to those in dpo 15 in the case n 1 these are presented in section 5 1 we recently learned that in dpo 15 mixed norm estimates for similar to our theorem 5 are also obtained in proving the results mentioned above multiple vector valued extensions for bht and play a very important role given a totally finite measure space w and f g r w c we define bht f g x w p v r f x t w g x t w dt t note that for a fixed value w w we have bht f g x w bht fw gw x where fw x f x w theorem 7 for any triple r 1 r 2 r with 1 r 1 r 2 1 r and so that 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r there exists a nonempty set dr 1 r 2 r of triples p q s satisfying 1 p 1 q 1 s for which bht lp r lr 1 w lq r lr 2 w ls r lr w this means that there exists a constant c so that bht f g lr w ls r c f lr 1 w lp r g lr 2 w lq r multiple vector valued inequalities via the helicoidal method 7 depending on the values of r 1 r 2 r we can give an explicit characterization of dr 1 r 2 r as follows i if 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r 1 2 then dr 1 r 2 r range bht ii if 1 r 2 1 r 1 2 1 r 1 1 2 then dr 1 r 2 r corresponds to those p q s range bht for which 0 1 q 3 2 1 r 1 iii if 1 r 1 1 r 1 2 1 r 2 1 2 then the range of exponents is similar to the one in ii with the roles of r 1 and r 2 interchanged that is dr 1 r 2 r consists of tuples p q s range bht for which 0 1 p 3 2 1 r 2 iv if 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 2 1 r 1 2 then dr 1 r 2 r corresponds to those p q s range bht for which 0 1 p 1 q 1 2 1 r 1 r 1 s 1 1 0 0 1 1 2 1 2 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 2 1 1 2 bb 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r figure 2 range for vector valued bht when 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r 1 2 1 r 1 3 2 1 r 1 1 2 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 0 0 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r b 0 3 2 1 r 1 1 r 1 1 2 figure 3 range for vector valued bht when 1 r 1 1 2 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r b 1 2 1 r 1 2 1 r 1 2 1 2 1 r 1 r 0 1 2 1 r 1 2 1 r 1 2 1 r 0 1 2 1 r figure 4 range for vector valued bht when 1 r 1 2 8 cristina benea and camil muscalu we emphasize that whenever p q s are so that 0 1 p 1 q 1 2 and consequently 1 s vector valued estimates exist for any tuple r 1 r 2 r these are the first examples of tuples p q s which allow for any bht r extension theorem 7 can be further generalized to multiple vector valued inequalities for an n tuple p p 1 pn the mixed l p norm on the product space w n j 1 wj n j 1 j n j 1 j is defined as f p w 1 wn f w 1 wn pnd n wn pn 1 pn d 1 w 1 1 p 1 consider the tuples r 1 r 11 r n 1 r 2 r 12 r n 2 and r r 1 rn satisfying for every 1 j n 1 r j 1 r j 2 1 r j 1 r j 1 1 r j 2 1 rj from now on this will be written as 1 r 1 r 2 1 r and 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r then we have the following multiple vector valued result theorem 8 let r 1 r 2 and r be as above if the tuples r 1 r 2 r satisfy the condition r j 1 r j 2 r j d r j 1 1 r j 1 2 r j 1 for every 1 j n 1 then there exists a set dr 1 r 2 r of triples p q s for which bht lp r lr 1 w lq r lr 2 w ls r lr w in addition dr 1 r 2 r dr 11 r 1 2 r 1 remark 1 the vector spaces lr wj j j can be both discrete r spaces or the euclidean lr r spaces for our applications they are going to be either of these 2 if the exponents r 1 r 11 r n 1 r 2 r 12 r n 2 and r r 1 rn are in the local l 2 range then the multiple vector valued inequalities hold for any p q s range bht as particular cases we mention the following bht lp 2 lq 2 ls 2 2 bht lp 2 lq 2 2 ls 1 2 for any p q s range bht also for proving an equivalent of theorem 6 in mixed norm spaces we need the more complex version bht lp 1 x lp 2 y 2 lq 1 x lq 2 y 2 2 ls 1 x ls 2 y 2 1 3 as mentioned earlier multiple vector valued estimates for bht play an important role in estimating bht n in the case n 1 one can obtain estimates for bht in the banach range by using duality and vector valued inequalities of the type bht lp 2 lq ls 2 and bht lp lq 2 ls 2 multiple vector valued inequalities via the helicoidal method 9 however 1 valued estimates cannot be avoided for n 3 for example if has the form f g x y z k l m q 1 kq 2 l p 3 m p 1 kq 2 lq 3 mf q 1 kp 2 l q 3 m x y z this is in part the novelty of our approach in theorem 6 and it contrasts with the situation of classical caldero n zygmund operators where 1 valued estimates cannot be expected 4 the optimality of the range in theorem 7 or that in theorem 8 remains with out answer for now since we use in our proofs the model operator for bht the obstructions appearing are similar to those in lt 99 these are described in c r 1 r 2 r equally important are multiple vector valued inequalities for paraproducts as they are essential in proving theorem 4 theorem 9 for any tuples r 1 r 11 r n 1 r 2 r 12 r n 2 and r r 1 rn satisfying component wise 1 r 1 r 2 1 r and 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r lp r lr 1 w lq r lr 2 w ls r lr w provided 1 p q 1 2 s and 1 p 1 q 1 s in other words vector valued estimates for paraproducts exist within the same range as that of scalar paraproducts this is also the case with classical caldero n zygmund operators original motivation we now describe the previously mentioned rubio de francia operator for iterated fourier integrals and the context where it appeared akns systems are systems of differential equations of the form 10 u i du au where u u 1 un t is a vector valued function defined on r d is a diagonal n n matrix with real and distinct entries d 1 d 2 dn and a ajk n j k 1 is a matrix valued function defined on r and so that ajj 0 for all 1 j n then one would like to prove that the solutions u j which depend on as well are bounded for all times that is 11 u j for a e and all 1 j n we want to have such an estimate under the weakest possible assumptions so we only require the entries of the potential matrix a to be integrable in some lp spaces ajk l pjk r for all 1 j k n j 6 k in the case of an upper triangular matrix a whose entries are functions gk l pk the solutions uj t at a fixed time t are a finite sum of expressions of the form c x 1 xm t g 1 x 1 gm xm e i 1 x 1 mxm dx 1 dxm 10 cristina benea and camil muscalu here m n and k 6 0 for all k as a consequence of d 1 6 6 dn hence the problem 11 reduces to estimating c m g 1 g 2 gm sup t x 1 xm t g 1 x 1 gm xm e i 1 x 1 mxm dx 1 dxm it was proved by christ and kiselv ck 01 a ck 01 b that c m is a bounded operator c m g 1 gm sm m k 1 gk pk for all 1 pk 2 such that 1 sm 1 p 1 1 p m on the other hand if the entries of the matrix a are l 2 functions the previous expression becomes equivalent to sup t x 1 xm t f 1 x 1 f m xm e i 1 x 1 mxm dx 1 dxm 12 denoted c m f 1 fm for m 1 this is exactly the carleson operator while m 2 corresponds to the bi carleson operator of mtt 06 both of which are known to be bounded operators with the remark that for the bi carleson the ks need to satisfy some non degeneracy condition c 2 h 1 h 2 s 2 h 1 p 1 h 2 p 2 for 1 p 1 p 2 1 s 2 1 p 1 1 p 2 and 2 3 s 2 moreover if instead of considering the sup in the expression 12 we look at the limiting behavior lim t uj t then we encounter iterated fourier integrals for example the bht operator as seen in 1 or the bi est operator of mtt 04 1 2 3 f 1 1 f 2 2 f 3 3 e 2 ix 1 2 3 d 1 d 2 d 3 now we consider the following mixed problem the matrix a is the sum of a lower triangular matrix with entries f k l 2 and an upper triangular matrix with entries gk lpk where 1 pk 2 using picard iteration the solutions uj t can be expressed as a series of terms of the form c r f 11 11 f 1 m 1 1 m 1 g 21 x 21 g 2 n 2 x 2 n 2 f l 1 l 1 f lml lml dxd where r 11 1 m 1 x 21 x 2 n 2 l 1 lml t the simplest of these operators where sup is dropped is given by 13 m f 1 f 2 g x 1 x 2 x 3 f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 g x 3 e 2 i x 1 x 2 x 3 dx 1 dx 2 dx 3 where f 1 l p 1 f 2 l p 2 1 p 1 p 2 and g l p with 1 p 2 the techniques from ck 01 a ck 01 b ck 98 akin to those used by paley in pal 31 are based on a dyadic filtration associated to one of the functions this involves a structure on r similar to that of the dyadic mesh on every level of the filtration one has a partition of r and passing to the next level of the filtration means refining the previous partition we want to use g in order to obtain this structure and for simplicity we assume g p 1 define the function x x g y pdy multiple vector valued inequalities via the helicoidal method 11 its image is the unit interval 0 1 and the filtration will consist of pre images through of the collection d of dyadic intervals in 0 1 because is increasing whenever x 2 x 3 we have 0 x 2 x 3 1 hence there exists a unique dyadic interval 0 1 so that x 2 is contained in the left half of which we denote l while x 3 is contained in the right half r to simplify notation we identify 1 with then the operator m can be written as d x 1 x 2 x 2 l x 3 r f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 g x 3 e 2 i x 1 x 2 x 3 dx 1 dx 2 dx 3 x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 l x 3 r f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 g x 3 e 2 i x 1 x 2 x 3 dx 1 dx 2 dx 3 14 x 1 l l x 2 l x 3 r f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 g x 3 e 2 i x 1 x 2 x 3 dx 1 dx 2 dx 3 15 here l l denotes the left endpoint of the interval l we call the operators in 14 and 15 m 1 and m 2 respectively the first term m 1 accounts for the occurrence of arbitrary intervals they are in fact 1 l and this combined with ho lder s inequality motivates the operator 16 tr f g x n k 1 ak 1 2 bk f 1 g 2 e 2 ix 1 2 d 1 d 2 r 1 r we have the following result theorem 10 if 1 r 2 then tr f g s f p g q whenever 1 p 1 q 1 s and p q s satisfy 0 1 p 1 q 1 2 1 r 1 r 1 s 1 on the other hand if r 2 tr is a bounded operator with the same range as the bht operator 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 2 1 r 1 2 1 r 1 2 1 2 1 r 1 r 0 1 2 1 r 1 2 1 r 1 2 1 r 0 1 2 1 r figure 5 range for tr operator for 1 r 2 in section 7 we will show how both m 1 and m 2 are bounded operators 12 cristina benea and camil muscalu theorem 11 the operators m 1 and m 2 satisfy the following m 1 l p 1 lp 2 lp lq provided 1 p 2 and 1 p 1 1 p 2 1 p 1 q while m 2 l p 1 lp 2 lp lq provided 1 p 2 1 p 2 1 p 1 and 1 p 1 1 p 2 1 p 1 q hence m m 1 m 2 is a bounded operator from l p 1 lp 2 lp lq provided 1 p 2 1 p 2 1 p 1 and 1 p 1 1 p 2 1 p 1 q however as robert kesler noticed in kes 15 the boundedness of the operator m can also be proved by making use of a vector valued extension for the linear operator bht f 1 the constraint for the exponents is given by 1 p 2 1 p 1 so even if m splits as m m 1 m 2 and the range of m 1 is larger one gets the same range for m through both methods because the intervals ak bk k are disjoint and arbitrary we refer to tr as a bilinear rubio de francia operator for iterated fourier integrals recall that rubio de francia s square function is the operator f 7 rf f x n k 1 ik f e 2 i xd 2 1 2 n k 1 pikf x 2 1 2 where ik ak bk 1 k n is a family of disjoint intervals and pi f denotes the fourier projection of f onto the interval i using vector valued singular integrals theory rubio de francia rdf 85 proved the boundedness of therf operator on lp for p 2 interpolating this result with estimates for carleson s operator from car 66 one gets more generally that the operator rf f x n k 1 pikf x 1 is bounded on lp as long as 1 p 1 1 in the particular case of a lacunary family of intervals that is ik 2 k 1 2 k and k z the above operator corresponds to a littlewood paley square function with sharp cutoffs which is bounded on lp r for any 1 p even more the lp norm of the square function is comparable to the lp norm of the initial function c 1 p f p k z r 1 2 k 1 2 k f e 2 ix d 2 1 2 p cp f p rubio de francia s theorem addresses the boundedness of a square function associated to an arbitrary family of intervals and in this sense it is optimal in the case 2 the condition p 2 is necessary while for 2 we need the strict inequality p returning to our operator tr note that it can also be regarded as a vector valued bilinear hilbert transform tr f g x k bht pikf pikg x r 1 r because the multiplier of the bht operator is equivalent to 1 1 2 as seen in 1 multiple vector valued inequalities via the helicoidal method 13 using solely khintchine s inequality it was proved in gl 06 that k bht fk gk 2 1 2 s k fk 2 1 2 p k gk 2 1 2 q this implies the boundedness of tr for r 2 p q 2 but this is a very limited range and in order to obtain estimates in the case p 2 or q 2 one needs the full power of vector valued extensions we note that our estimates for the operator tr are sharp in the sense that the same estimates are satisfied by 17 f g 7 k pikf x pikg x r 1 r in 17 bht pikf pikg is replaced by the product of the functions pikf pikg in general the best one can hope for a bilinear fourier multiplier operator is that it satisfies the same lp estimates as the product f g 7 f g and this is the case for tr moreover in the special case of lacunary dyadic intervals for any 1 r we have that f g 7 k 2 k 2 k 1 f g e 2 ix d d r 1 r is a bounded operator from lp lq to ls for any p q s range bht the cases p or q cannot be obtained directly but follow by duality our initial proof of theorem 10 did not involve vector valued bilinear hilbert trans form operators but it was built around localizations of bht in conjunction with several stopping times afterwards we realized that this method is suitable for other general situ ations which eventually led to the development of the helicoidal method this applies to paraproducts bht carleson operator rubio de francia operator etc in the study of the tr operator the stopping times were dictated by level sets of linear rubio de francia operators rfr 1 f and rfr 2 g for the vector valued bht the three stopping times that are used for estimating the trilinear form are dictated by level sets of k fk r 1 1 r 1 k gk r 2 1 r 2 and k hk r 1 r the method of the proof is described in more detail in section 2 5 lastly we want to point out an interesting connection with another open problem in time frequency analysis the boundedness of the hilbert transform along vector fields more exactly if v r 2 r 2 is a non vanishing measurable vector field then one defines the hilbert transform along v as hvf x y p v r f x y t v x y dt t it was conjectured by stein that hv is a bounded operator on l 2 whenever v is lipschitz some partial results in this direction are known in the case of a one variable vector field in bt 13 m bateman and c thiele proved the lp boundedness of hv for 3 2 p and provided that v x y v x 0 the proof is making use of the littlewood paley square function in the second variable restrictions to certain fixed sets g and h together with single annulus estimates for hv from bat 13 in the special case when f x y g x h y estimates for the variational 14 cristina benea and camil muscalu carleson from ost 12 yield the same result whenever p 4 3 it is still not known if this can be extended to general functions f x y or whether one can push the lower bound for p below 4 3 in sil 14 silva is using ideas similar to the ones described above obtaining in this way vector valued extensions for bht whenever 4 3 r 4 our methods allow us to prove that vector valued extensions exist for any 1 r in fact for any triple r 1 r 2 r it would be interesting to understand whether the localization argument that we are employing can be transferred to the study of the hilbert transform along vector fields besides having sharp estimates for the local version of the operator the structure of the intervals chosen through the triple stopping time can play a role in itself the collections of intervals constitute a maximal covering for the level sets of certain maximal operators and for that reason they form a sparse collection of intervals in the sense of ler 13 from here weighted estimates can be deduced and a similar approach was carried out in cdpo 16 the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we recall some definitions and results regarding multilinear operators the helicoidal method is described in details in section 2 5 multiple vector valued extensions for bht are presented in section 3 and those for paraproducts in section 4 following in section 5 are the estimates for bht n the leibniz rules are a modification of mixed norm lp estimates for and are discussed in section 6 the rubio de francia theorem for iterated fourier integrals and its application

supported by nsf grant dms 1500262 2 some classical results on the bilinear hilbert transform in this paper we use chapter 6 of ms 13 as a black box but we recall a few definitions and results to ease the reading of the presentation essential here are the notions of size and energy which are quantities associated to certain subsets of the phase frequency space notation for any interval i r define i x 1 dist x i i 100 the mesh of dyadic intervals is denoted by d definition 1 a tile is a rectangle p ip p with the property that ip p d or p is in a shifted variant of d we define a tri tile to be a tuple p p 1 p 2 p 3 where each pi is a tile as defined above and the spatial intervals are the same ipi ip for all 1 i 3 definition 2 order relation given two tiles p and p we say p p if ip ip and p 3 p p p if p p or p p also p p if ip ip and p 100 p and p p if p p but p p definition 3 a collection p of tri tiles is said to have rank 1 if for any p p p the following conditions are satisfied if the tri tiles are distinct p 6 p then p j 6 pj for all 1 j 3 if pj 0 p j 0 for some j 0 then pj p j for all 1 j 3 multiple vector valued inequalities via the helicoidal method 15 if p j 0 pj 0 for some j 0 then p j pj for all 1 j 3 if in addition to p j 0 pj 0 one also assumes ip ip then p j pj for all j 6 j 0 definition 4 let p be a sparse rank 1 collection of tri tiles and let 1 j 3 a subcollection t of p is called a j tree if and only if there exists a tri tile pt called the top of the tree such that pj pt j for all p t we write it for ipt and tj for pt j and we say t is a tree if it is a j tree for some 1 j 3 definition 5 let 1 i 3 a finite sequence of trees t 1 tm is said to be a chain of strongly i disjoint trees if and only if i pi 6 p i for every p tl 1 and p tl 2 with l 1 6 l 2 ii whenever p tl 1 and p tl 2 with l 1 6 l 2 are such that 2 pi 2 p i 6 then if pi p i one has ip itl 1 and if p i pi one has ip itl 2 iii whenever p tl 1 and p tl 2 with l 1 l 2 are such that 2 pi 2 p i 6 and pi p i then ip itl 1 definition 6 let p be a tile a wave packet on p is a smooth function p which has fourier support inside 9 10 p and is l 2 adapted to ip in the sense that 18 l p x cl m 1 ip 1 2 l 1 dist x ip ip m for sufficiently many derivatives l and any m 0 2 1 model operator for bht a discretized model operator for bht is given by 19 bhtp f g x p p 1 ip 1 2 f 1 p 1 g 2 p 2 3 p 3 x where the family p of tri tiles is sparse and has rank 1 while jpj p p are wave packets associated to the tiles pj in some sense the bilinear hilbert transform is the canonical example of such an operator above we also included the definitions of trees and chains of strongly disjoint trees because they are essential in understanding such singular bilinear operators the model operator from 19 was introduced in lt 99 and the bilinear hilbert transform itself can be represented as an average of such shifted model operators the detailed reduction can be found in ms 13 chapter 6 as a consequence the boundedness of the bilinear hilbert transform within range bht can be deduced from similar estimates for the model operator similarly estimates for vector valued and for the localized bilinear hilbert transform will follow once we prove their equivalents for the model operator and we will not insist on the exact distinction between the two it is worth mentioning however that the model operator fails to be bounded for s 2 3 leaving undecided the boundedness of the bilinear hilbert transform itself for 1 2 s 2 3 bilinear operators are often studied with the use of the associated trilinear form in the case of the model operator for bht operator the trilinear form is given by 20 bht p f g h p p 1 ip 1 2 f 1 p 1 g 2 p 2 h 3 p 3 16 cristina benea and camil muscalu definition 7 if p is a collection of tri tiles and i 0 is a dyadic interval we denote by p i 0 the tiles p in p whose spatial interval ip is contained in i 0 p i 0 p p ip i 0 definition 8 let p be a finite collection of tri tiles let j 1 2 3 and let f be an arbitrary function we define the size of the sequence f j pj p by 21 size f j pj p sup t p 1 it p t f j pj 2 1 2 where t ranges over all trees in p that are i trees for some i 6 j lemma 1 lemma 6 13 of ms 13 let j 1 2 3 and let e be a set of finite measure then for every f 1 e one has size f j pj p sup p p 1 ip e mip dx for all m 0 with implicit constants depending on m thanks to lemma 1 which is a consequence of the john nirenberg inequality we can work with the simpler sizes size f sup p p 1 ip r f mip dx where m is some large number to be chosen later we will also need a size that behave well with respect to localization in the formula above we consider the supremum over the spacial intervals ip of the collection p in our proofs we will need to compare size p i 0 f and 1 i 0 r f i 0 dx so the following definition is natural definition 9 if i 0 is a fixed dyadic interval then we define 22 s ize p i 0 f sup j 3 i 0 p p i 0 ip j 1 j r f mj dx we note that for any function f size p i 0 f s ize p i 0 f definition 10 let p be a finite collection of tri tiles j 1 2 3 and let f be a fixed function we define the energy of the sequence f j pj p by 23 energy f j pj p sup n z 2 n sup t t t it 1 2 where t ranges over all chains of strongly j disjoint trees in p which are i trees for some i 6 j having the property that p t f j pj 2 1 2 2 n it 1 2 multiple vector valued inequalities via the helicoidal method 17 for all t t and such that p t f j pj 2 1 2 2 n 1 it 1 2 for all subtrees t t t we have the following estimates for the trilinear form and energy proposition 1 prop 6 12 of ms 13 let p be a finite collection of tri tiles then bht p f 1 f 2 f 3 3 j 1 size fj j pj p j energy fj j pj p 1 j for any 0 1 2 3 1 with 1 2 3 1 the implicit constants depend on the j but are independent of the other parameters lemma 2 lemma 6 14 of ms 13 let j 1 2 3 and f l 2 r then energy f j pj p f 2 however for our specific problem we need more accurate estimates for the localized trilinear form this will follow in section 2 4 and in section 3 1 2 2 interpolation since this is a fundamental tool in harmonic analysis we recall a few facts about inter polation methods we adapt the results from thi 06 and emphasize how the constants change through interpolation in our applications we need to keep track of the constants many of the proofs in the following sections are iterative and the operatorial norm ob tained after interpolation becomes a size on the subsequent step of the induction we recall a few definitions and results but we will be mainly using their generalization to banach spaces definition 11 for a subset e r of finite measure define x e f f 1 e a e we will denote by v the linear span of all x e which plays an important role because it is a dense subspace of all lp spaces for 1 p definition 12 a tuple 1 n is called admissible if for all 1 i n i 1 and 1 n 1 and there is at most one index j 0 so that j 0 0 we call an index good if i 0 and bad if i 0 definition 13 a multilinear form v v c is of restricted type 1 n with 0 i 1 if there exists a constant c possibly depending on such that for each tuple e e 1 en of measurable subsets of r and for each tuple f f 1 fn with fj x ej we have f 1 fn c j ej j 18 cristina benea and camil muscalu theorem 12 similar to theorem 3 2 in thi 06 let 1 n be a tuple of real numbers such that j j 1 and j 0 for all j assume is of restricted type for all in a neighborhood of satisfying j j 1 with constant c depending continuously on then is of strong type with constant c f 1 fn c n j 1 fj 1 j for all fj v for multilinear operators it often happens that the target space is an lp space with 0 p 1 this is not a banach space but we can conclude the desired outcome by interpolating weak lq estimates for q in a neighborhood of p lq norms are dualized in the following way lemma 3 lemma 2 5 from ms 13 let 0 r 1 and a 0 then the following statements are equivalent i f r a ii for every set e with 0 e there exists a major subset e e i e e e 2 so that f 1 e a e 1 r where 1 r 1 r 1 note that for r 6 1 r is a negative number definition 14 let be an n tuple of real numbers and assume j 1 for all j an n linear form is called of generalized restricted type if there is a constant c possibly depending on such that for all tuples e e 1 en there is an index j 0 and a major subset e j 0 ej 0 so that for all tuples f f 1 fn with fj x ej for j 6 j 0 and fj 0 x e j 0 24 f 1 fn c n j 1 ej j if a tuple 1 n is good then generalized restricted type estimates coincide with restricted type estimates proposition 2 similar to lemma 3 6 in thi 06 if 1 n is a good tuple and is of generalized restricted type with constant c and the major subset corresponds to the index j 0 then is of restricted type with constant c 1 2 j 0 theorem 13 thm 3 8 of thi 06 assume t f 1 fn 1 fn is of generalized restricted type where j j 1 assume k 0 for 1 k n 1 and n 0 assume is also of generalized restricted type with constant c continuously depending on for all in a neighborhood of satisfying j j 1 then the multilinear operator t satisfies 25 t f 1 fn 1 1 1 n c n 1 j 1 fj 1 j 2 3 interpolation for banach valued functions the banach space interpolation theory is very similar to the scalar version the difference consisting in replacing the norm on c by x on a banach space x multiple vector valued inequalities via the helicoidal method 19 we say that f lp r x provided f lp r x r f x p xdx 1 p the question of integrability of f x is reduced to the lebesgue integrability of x 7 f x x the set of vector valued step functions is dense in l p r x and for this reason similarly to the scalar case it will be enough to deal with function in f f x x 1 e x a e e r subset of finite measure the linear span of such sets will be denoted vx the multilinear form associated with an operator is obtained through dualization more exactly f lp r x sup g lp r x 1 r g x f x dx whenever 1 p we will deal with a vector valued multilinear or multi sublinear operator of the form t lp 1 r x 1 l pn 1 r xn 1 l pn r xn the multilinear form associated with this operator vx 1 vxn 1 vx n c is given by f 1 fn 1 fn r t f 1 fn 1 x fn x dx the definitions and proofs from the scalar case are adaptable to the vector valued situation for completeness we present them here adapting the equivalent statements from thi 06 definition 15 a tuple 1 n is called admissible if 1 n 1 1 n 1 and for at most one index j 0 we have j 0 0 a multi sublinear form as above is of restricted type 1 n for a good admissible tuple if there exists a constant c so that for each tuple e e 1 en of measurable subsets of r and for each tuple f f 1 fn with fj x 1 ej we have f 1 fn c e 1 1 en n proposition 3 equivalent of thm 3 2 of thi 06 let 1 n be an admissible tuple of real numbers such that j 0 for all j assume that is of restricted type for all admissible tuples in a neighborhood of then there is a constant c such that for all fj vxj f 1 fn c f 1 l 1 1 r x 1 fn l 1 n r xn definition 16 let be an admissible tuple the n sublinear form is of generalized restricted type if there is a constant c such that for all tuples e e 1 en there is an index j 0 and a major subset e j 0 of ej 0 that is e j 0 ej 0 2 such that for all tuples f f 1 fn with fj xj 1 ej for j 6 j 0 and fj 0 xj 0 1 e j 0 we have f 1 fn c j ej j proposition 4 if is of generalized restricted type 1 n and j 0 for all j then is of restricted type 20 cristina benea and camil muscalu on the other hand if one of the indices j is 0 the generalized restricted type implies only weak lp estimates this works in the case when the multi sublinear form is given by 26 f 1 fn r t f 1 fn 1 x fn x dx and corresponds to an operator t defined on vx 1 vxn 1 and taking values in vxn proposition 5 let be a multi sublinear form as in 26 and 1 n an admissible tuple with n 0 assuming that is of generalized restricted type we have x t f 1 fn 1 x xn 1 1 n a n 1 j 1 ej j for all tuples f f 1 fn 1 with fj xj 1 ej proposition 6 assume is of generalized restricted type where is an admissible tuple with n 0 assume is also of generalized restricted type for all admissible tuples in a neighborhood of then t satisfies 27 t f 1 fn 1 l 1 1 n r xn c n 1 j 1 fj l 1 j r xj the proofs of the last two propositions follow exactly the same ideas as those corre sponding to the scalar case with very minor differences 2 4 a few technical lemmas in this section we present a few results that will be useful later on for estimating a trilinear form associated to a collection p of tri tiles well localized in space ip i 0 for all p p lemma 4 if i 0 is a fixed dyadic interval k z and f is a function so that 2 k 1 dist supp f i 0 i 0 2 k then energy p i 0 f 2 mk f 2 proof following definition 10 there exists a collection t of j disjoint trees t t p i 0 so that energy p i 0 f 2 t t p t f pj 2 we denote t t t p t p the collection of all tiles in t and estimate the rhs of the expression above in the following way t t p t f pj 2 m 0 i i 0 i 2 m i 0 p t ip i f pj 2 the collection of tiles p t with ip i for a fixed interval i are all disjoint in frequency in fact since they are of the same scale they are translations of some fixed tile and hence p t ip i f pj 2 r f x 2 1 dist x i i 2 m dx multiple vector valued inequalities via the helicoidal method 21 this will imply that t t p t f pj 2 m 0 i i 0 i 2 m i 0 r f x 2 1 dist x i i 2 m dx m 0 i i 0 i 2 m i 0 f 2 2 2 2 km i 0 i 2 m f 2 2 2 2 km m 0 2 mm f 2 2 2 2 km on the other hand if f is supported inside 5 i 0 we know already from lemma 2 that energy p i 0 f f 2 since the collection p i 0 is localized in space on the interval i 0 we have the following estimate for the trilinear form bht p i 0 lemma 5 refinement of proposition 6 12 of ms 13 the trilinear form bht p i 0 satisfies bht p i 0 f g h size p i 0 f 1 size p i 0 g 2 size p i 0 h 3 28 f i 0 1 1 2 g i 0 1 2 2 h i 0 1 3 2 for any 0 1 2 3 1 with 1 2 3 1 the implicit constants depend on the j but are independent of the other parameters proof for any l 1 we define il 2 l 1 i 0 2 li 0 and i 0 2 i 0 in this way for any x il 1 dist x i 0 i 0 2 l we will be using the following decompositions 29 f k 1 0 fk 1 k 1 0 f 1 ik 1 and similarly g k 2 0 gk 2 k 2 0 g 1 ik 2 h k 3 0 hk 3 k 3 0 h 1 ik 3 from proposition 1 the trilinear

hk 3 1 3 we will only employ the extra decay in the energy for the size we have simply size p i 0 fk 1 size p i 0 f uniformly in k 1 22 cristina benea and camil muscalu on the other hand since fk 1 is supported on ik 1 lemma 4 implies that energy p i 0 fk 1 2 k 1 m fk 1 2 hence we obtain bht p i 0 f g h size p i 0 f 1 size p i 0 g 2 size p i 0 h 3 k 1 k 2 k 3 2 k 1 m fk 1 2 1 1 2 k 2 m gk 2 2 1 2 2 k 1 m hk 3 2 1 3 the expressions in the last line are summable via ho lder s inequality more exactly since j 1 k 1 0 2 k 1 m 1 1 2 2 k 1 m 2 1 1 fk 1 2 1 1 k 1 2 k 1 m 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 k 1 2 k 1 m 1 1 fk 1 2 2 1 1 2 f i 1 1 1 for m sufficiently large we note that the implicit constants will depend on 1 only this proves inequality 28 2 5 the helicoidal method with the intention of bringing to light the ideas behind our proofs we present the main strategy in a simplified setting unfortunately we cannot avoid the specific terminology but one should think of the sizes as being averages while the energies are l 2 quantities that reflect orthogonality for estimating the norms bht f g s we use interpolation results for the trilinear form bht f g h bht f g h in what follows i 0 f g h denotes a space localization of bht f g h to the fixed interval i 0 more specifically it is the form associated to a model operator of bht as in 19 where the spatial intervals of the tiles lie inside the fixed dyadic interval i 0 similarly n i 0 f g h denotes a space localization of the corresponding trilinear form in the multiple vector valued setting the helicoidal method is an iterated induction procedure suitable for proving vector valued estimates for linear and multilinear operators we describe the main ideas in the case of the bht operator and later on we will indicate the equivalent statements for paraproducts and carleson operator at the heart of our argument lies the following induction statement induction statement let n 0 we fix i 0 a dyadic interval and f g h subsets of r of finite measure let r 1 r 11 r n 1 r 2 r 12 r n 2 and r r 1 r n be n tuples so that 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r 1 while f g and h are vector valued functions satisfying f x lr 1 w 1 f x g x lr 2 w 1 g x and h x lr w 1 h x then we have the following estimate for the trilinear form ni 0 p n ni 0 f g h s ize i 01 f 1 2 1 2 s ize i 01 g 1 2 2 2 s ize i 01 h 1 2 3 2 i 0 for every 0 1 2 3 1 1 2 3 1 satisfying an extra condition c r 1 r 2 r multiple vector valued inequalities via the helicoidal method 23 in the local l 2 case the condition c r 1 r 2 r is satisfied automatically that is the p n statement is true for all 0 1 2 3 as above this condition is the main obstruction in obtaining for bht r the same range of l p estimates as that of the scalar bht in 37 we point out the source of this constraint now we present the proofs of the induction statements p 0 and p n p n 1 also for the reader s convenience we include the p 0 p 1 step as we will see later on the fact that p n implies our theorems 7 and 8 is based on a standard triple stopping time argument involving the above localized sizes check p 0 this is the scalar bht case with f 1 f g 1 g and h 1 h this situation is well understood and we have from proposition 1 i 0 f g h s ize i 0 f 1 s ize i 0 g 2 s ize i 0 h 3 energy i 0 f 1 1 energy i 0 g 1 2 energy i 0 h 1 3 for any 0 1 2 3 1 such that 1 2 3 1 since we are considering a localized model of bht where all the tiles have their spatial intervals ip i 0 one can refine lemma 1 and obtain energy i 0 f f i 0 2 s ize i 01 f 1 2 i 0 1 2 noticing that i 0 1 1 2 i 0 1 3 2 i 0 1 3 2 i 0 we obtain the desired p 0 check p 0 p 1 assume that 30 k fk r 1 1 r 1 1 f k gk r 2 1 r 2 1 g and k hk r 1 r 1 h given that we know p 0 we will prove k i 0 fk gk hk s ize i 01 f 1 2 1 2 s ize i 01 g 1 2 2

interpolation methods we can assume that fk 1 e 1 gk 1 e 2 hk 1 e 3 so we need to show i 0 fk 1 f gk 1 g hk 1 h i 0 e 1 1 e 2 2 e 3 3 where 1 2 3 is an admissible tuple arbitrarily close to 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r in order to get the desired expression for i 0 we need another stopping time inside i 0 this is illustrated in figure 7 bbbbb i i f 1 1 f g 1 1 g h 1 1 h i f 2 1 f g 2 1 g h 2 1 h b b b b b i fn

inequality we have to make sure that the exponents 1 1 2 1 1 2 2 2 1 3 2 3 are all positive which is always the case in the local l 2 situation since 1 2 3 are arbitrarily close to 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r this is the origin of the constraint c r 1 r 2 r summing over the intervals i given by the alluded triple stopping time over the corre sponding averages we recover e 1 1 e 2 2 e 3 3 we note that the

irrelevant check p n p n 1 lastly we present the general induction step in the case of iterated p spaces we have multi indices r 1 r 11 r n 1 r 2 r 12 r n 2 r r 1 r n and f r 1 1 f g r 2 1 g h r 1 h

1 r once we have such a result p n 1 follows easily by ho lder exactly as before we will prove 34 by using restricted type interpolation instead of estimating the trilinear form ni 0 we will deal with 35 n f g h i 0 fk gk hk i 0 fk 1 f gk 1 g hk 1 h this is natural since condition 33 implies that the functions fk are supported on f and similarly the functions gk are supported on g and hk on h by interpolation theory we can assume that fk r 1 1 e 1 gk r 2 1 e 2 and hk r 1 e 3 and it suffices to prove 36 n f g h i 0 fk gk hk ni 0 e 1 1 e 2 2 e 3 3 for 1 2 3 in a small neighborhood of 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r similarly to the case p 0 p 1 we will have a stopping time inside i 0 so in fact we need to estimate n f g h i fk gk hk for some i i 0 it is here that we use hypothesis p n n f g h i fk gk hk ni fk 1 f gk 1 g hk 1 h with fk 1 f r 1 1 f e 1 gk 1 g r 2 1 g e 2 and hk 1 h r 1 h e 3 more precisely n f g h i fk gk hk s ize i 1 f 1 e 1 1 2 1 2 s ize i 1 g 1 e 2 1 2 2 2 s ize i 1 h 1 e 3 1 2 3 2 i s

per formed with respect to the three sizes the expressions s ize i 1 e 1 1 add up to e 1 1 and similarly for the sizes of 1 e 2 and 1 e 3 interpolating we get the desired 36 from the above equation we can see why the operatorial norm has the form ni 0 s ize i 01 f 1 1 2 1 r 1 s ize i 01 g 1 2 2 1 r 2 s ize i 01 h 1 3 2 1 r the which is a slight modification on the in the p n statement appears as an interpolation error moreover the conditions 37 1 1 2 1 r 1 0 1 2 2 1 r 2 0 1 3 2 1 r 0 are necessary and they imply the constraint c r 1 r 2 r this ends the proof of the induction step the same method applies in the case of paraproducts the difference here is that the energies are l 1 quantities and for that reason we don t have any extra assumptions the range of the multiple vector valued extensions is the same as that of the paraproducts the model operator for paraproducts corresponds to a rank 0 family of tri tiles that is once we know the spatial interval ip there is no other degree of freedom and the frequency multiple vector valued inequalities via the helicoidal method 27 intervals are 1 ip 2 ip or 0 1 ip the exact definitions will be introduced in section 4 induction statement paraproducts case under the same assumptions as in 2 5 the localized trilinear form for paraproducts satisfies p n ni 0 f g h s ize i 01 f 1 s ize i 01 g 1 s ize i 01 h 1 i 0 provided f x lr 1 w 1 f x g x lr 2 w 1 g x and h x lr w 1 h x finally we want to point out that the helicoidal method applies equally in the case of sub linear operators one last example is that of the carleson operator crf x sup n n f e 2 ix d for which umd valued extensions are already known from the work of hyto nen and lacey hl 13 in ds 15 demeter and silva give an alternative proof for 2 valued inequalities for the carleson operator in fact they present a new principle built around ideas from bt 13 for dealing with 2 valued inequalities for sublinear operators which are not of caldero n zygmund type we do not present all the details here but the essential statement for proving multiple vector valued inequalities for the carleson operator using the helicoidal method is the following induction statement carleson operator under the same assumptions as in 2 5 the localized bilinear form for the discretized carleson operator satisfies p n nc i 0 f g s ize i 01 f 1 s ize i 01 g 1 i 0 provided that f x lr 1 w 1 f x and g x lr 2 w 1 g x comparing the main statements of the above three examples we can see from the exponents of the sizes that the range of lp estimates for the vector valued carleson operator and for the vector valued paraproduct will coincide with the range of the scalar operator however for bht things are more complicated 3 multiple vector valued estimates for bht in this section we describe the detailed proof of our theorems 7 and 8 3 1 estimates for localized bht here we assume that f g and h are fixed subsets of r of finite measure and i 0 is a fixed dyadic interval we are interested in finding estimates for the bilinear operator bht f g h i 0 f g x p p i 0 1 ip 1 2 f 1 f 1 p 1 g 1 g 2 p 2 3 p 3 x 1 h x 28 cristina benea and camil muscalu in doing so we first study the associated trilinear form f g h bht p i 0 f g h p p i 0 1 ip 1 2 f 1 f 1 p 1 g 1 g 2 p 2 h 1 h 3 p 3 while this operator satisfies the same estimates as the bilinear hilbert transform the localization to the sets f g and h and the restriction to the tiles in p i 0 will bring some extra decay first we prove a result in the local l 2 case when 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r 1 2 in this situation the proof is simpler because we are employing energies which are l 2 expressions and they can easily be related to lri averages when ri 2 proposition 7 the case r 1 r 2 r 2 let p be a family of tri tiles i 0 a dyadic interval and f g h r sets of finite measure then one can find positive numbers a 1 a 2 and a 3 so that f g h bht p i 0 f g h size p i 0 1 f a 1 size p i 0 1 g a 2 size p i 0 1 h a 3 f i 0 r 1 g i 0 r 2 h i 0 r 38 we can choose aj 1 2 rj 0 for a very small 0 proof in this case we are proving restricted type estimates by applying directly proposition 1 let e 1 e 2 e 3 be sets of finite measure and f 1 e 1 g 1 e 2 h 1 e 3 we have bht f 1 f g 1 g h 1 h size p i 0 f 1 f 1 size p i 0 g 1 g 2 size p i 0 h 1 h 3 energy f 1 f 1 1 energy g 1 g 1 2 energy h 1 h 1 3 39 for any 0 1 2 3 1 such that 1 2 3 1 recall that the sizes can be estimated by size p i 0 f 1 f sup p p i 0 1 ip 1 e 1 1 f m ip dx where m can be chosen as large as we wish then we observe that if e 1 is supported away from i 0 the sizes will decay fast giving the desired f i 0 r 1 on the right hand side similarly for e 2 and e 3 for this reason we can assume that the sets e 1 e 2 e 3 are supported on 5 i 0 and then we will need to show only that bht p i 0 f 1 f g 1 g h 1 h size p i 0 1 f a 1 size p i 0 1 g a 2 size p i 0 1 h a 3 f r 1 g r 2 h r we are using the energies precisely for estimating the norms of f g and h so the sizes are playing the role of a constant here as we have seen in lemma 2 the energies are bounded by l 2 norms so from 39 we have f g h bht p i 0 f g h size p i 0 1 f 1 size p i 0 1 g 2 size p i 0 1 h 3 e 1 1 1 2 e 2 1 2 2 e 3 1 3 2 by varying 1 2 and 3 we see that these restricted type estimates are true in a very small neighborhood of 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r and the interpolation theorem 12 yields strong type estimates note that the constant in this case is size p i 0 1 f 1 size p i 0 1 g 2 size p i 0 1 h 3 which depends on the functions 1 f 1 g 1 h the fixed interval i 0 the values of 1 2 and 3 but not on the functions f g h multiple vector valued inequalities via the helicoidal method 29 now we deal with the general banach triangle case where 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r is an admissible tuple satisfying 0 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r 1 the proof is going to be more complicated because we will need to use the sizes as well for reconstructing the norms of f g h in addition we will also need to use the sizes of 1 f 1 g and 1 h later on proposition 8 let f g and h be as above and let p i 0 be a family of tri tiles localized to the dyadic interval i 0 then there exist positive numbers a 1 a 2 and a 3 so that f g h bht p i 0 f g h 40 s ize p i 0 1 f a 1 s ize p i 0 1 g a 2 s ize p i 0 1 h a 3 f i 0 r 1 g i 0 r 2 h i 0 r where 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r 1 in fact for 0 small enough 41 a 1 1 1 2 1 r 1 a 2 1 2 2 1 r 2 a 3 1 3 2 1 r where 1 2 3 are so that 0 1 2 3 1 1 2 3 1 and the expressions in 41 are positive proof in this case we will use the interpolation theorem 13 and for this reason we cannot obtain directly the expression in the rhs of 40 which represents localized lp norms however as we will see soon it will be enough to prove that bht p i 0 is of generalized restricted type 1 2 3 for in a small neighborhood of 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r then the result in 40 will be a consequence of the fast decay of the wave packets away from i 0 we start with e 1 e 2 e 3 sets of finite measure and define to be the exceptional set x m 1 e 1 c e 1 e 3 x m 1 e 2 c e 2 e 3 let e 3 e 3 we want to prove that 40 holds for any functions f g h so that f 1 e 1 g 1 e 2 and h 1 e 3 for simplicity we assume that 1 dist ip c ip 2 d for every tile p p i 0 equivalently we could decompose the collection of tiles into subcollections for which this property holds for all d 0 in the end however the estimate 40 will be independent of such a decomposition with the above assumption for every p p i 0 we have 1 ip r 1 e 1 1 f m ip dx 2 d e 1 e 3 and 1 ip r 1 e 2 1 g m ip dx 2 d e 2 e 3 this is important because now we can perform a stopping time which will allow us to estimate the sizes of the functions 1 ej for each of the functions 1 f 1 e 1 1 g 1 e 2 and 1 h 1 e 3 we will be looking for maximal dyadic intervals j which are maximizers for 42 sup j i 0 p p i 0 ip j 1 j r 1 e 1 1 f m j dx 30 cristina benea and camil muscalu this is the reason we introduced the new size in definition 9 the selection of the intervals and tiles is described in more detail in section 3 2 so here we only sketch this process we start with the largest possible value 2 l 1 2 d e 1 e 2 and define il 1 to be the collection of maximal dyadic intervals i with the property that it contains some ip p i 0 which is not contained in any of the intervals previously selected and i also has the property that 2 l 1 1 1 i r 1 e 1 1 f m i dx 2 l 1 then for each i il 1 we find the relevant tiles p with ip i and move them in p i afterwards we restart the algorithm for the collection p i 0 i il 1 p i the algorithm continues by decreasing 2 l 1 until all tiles in p i 0 are exhausted in this way for any l 1 and any i il 1 we have s ize p i 1 e 1 1 f 2 l 1 similarly we define the collections of dyadic intervals il 2 associated with the functions 1 e 2 1 g as long as 2 l 2 2 d e 2 e 3 for the third component the collections il 3 are non empty as long as 2 n 3 2 m d and in that case for any i il 3 we have s ize p i 1 h 1 e 3 2 n 3 the extra decay is due to the fact that e 3 is actually supported on c given l 1 l 2 l 3 as above we denote i l 1 l 2 l 3 il 1 il 2 il 3 this is also going to be a collection of dyadic intervals and any tile in p i 0 will be contained in some p i with i il 1 l 2 l 3 in fact these collections depend on the parameter d as well which controls the distance from the exceptional set we have p i 0 d l 1 l 2 l 3 i i l 1 l 2 l 3 d p i but we suppress the dependency on d in the notation thus 43 f g h bht p i 0 f g h l 1 l 2 l 3 i il 1 l 2 l 3 f g h bht p i f g h every f g h bht p i f g h is going to be estimated by lemma 5 f g h bht p i f g h s ize p i 1 e 1 1 f 1 s ize p i 1 e 2 1 g 2 s ize p i 1 e 3 1 h 3 1 e 1 1 f i 1 1 2 1 e 2 1 g i 1 2 2 1 e 3 1 h i 1 3

1 3 2 1 r 0 multiple vector valued inequalities via the helicoidal method 31 we can estimate f g h bht p i 0 f g h as f g h bht p i 0 f g h l 1 l 2 l 3 i il 1 l 2 l 3 s ize p i 1 e 1 1 f 1 s ize p i 1

norm f g h bht p i 0 associated to the trilinear form f g h bht p i 0 as seen in 40 we are left with estimating i il 1 l 2 l 3 i which can be realized in three different ways for example i il 1 l 2 l 3 i i il 1 i i il 1 1 i 1 i il 1 2 l 1 m 1 e 1 1 i 1 2 n 1 e 1 for this reason whenever 0 j 1 with 1 2 3 1 we have i il 1 l 2 l 3 i 2 l 1 e 1 1 2 l 2 e 2 2 2 l 3 e 3 3 this yields l 1 l 2 l 3 i il 1 l

1 r 2 e 3 1 r summing over d this proves 40 in the particular case of characteristic functions upon interpolating we lose an power of s ize p i 0 1 f and s ize p i 0 1 g respectively to get f g h bht p i 0 f g h s ize p i 0 1 f a 1 s ize p i 0 1 g a 2 s ize p i 0 1 h a 3 f i 0 r 1 g i 0 r 2 h i 0 r 32 cristina benea and camil muscalu we note that the weights i 0 will not affect the interpolation process once we have an inequality that holds for characteristic functions of finite sets interpolation implies a similar result in full generality the exponents a 1 a 2 and a 3 can be described as a 1 1 1 2 1 r 1 a 2 1 2 2 1 r 2 a 3 1 3 2 1 r for some sufficiently small and for 0 1 2 3 1 satisfying 1 2 3 1 that will be chosen later corollary 1 the case r 1 let 1 r 1 r 2 be so that 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 and 1 2 satisfying 1 1 2 1 r 1 and 1 2 2 1 r 2 then bht f g h p i 0 f g 1 s ize p i 0 1 f 1 1 2 1 r 1 s ize p i 0 1 g 1 2 2 1 r 2 s ize p i 0 1 h 1 3 2 f i 0 r 1 g i 0 r 2 proof a careful examination of 45 shows that one can choose any triple 1 2 3 with 1 2 3 1 even with 3 0 in the place of 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r in this case we get f g h bht p i 0 f g h s ize p i 0 1 f 1 1 2 1 s ize p i 0 1 g 1 2 2 2 s ize p i 0 1 h 1 3 2 e 1 1 e 2 2 e 3 3 the restrictions are that j 1 j 2 which works well for very small or negative values of 3 interpolating between tuples 1 2 3 that lie in a small open neighborhood of 1 r 1 1 r 2 0 we get the conclusion in this case the interpolation is used for estimating the l 1 norm of the operator and not the trilinear form f g h bht p i 0 3 2 proof of theorem 7 recall that the vector valued bht is defined by bht f g x w r f x t w g x t w dt t bht fw gw x then the trilinear form associated with it is bht f g h r w bht f g x w h x w d w dx first we prove generalized restricted type estimates for bht f g h and the general result will follow from the vector valued interpolation result presented in proposition 6 let f g and h be sets of finite measure in what follows we will construct a major subset h h and show 46 bht p f g h f 1 g 2 h 3 whenever f x lr 1 w 1 f x g x lr 2 w 1 g x and h x lr w 1 h x for simplicity assume h 1 the exceptional set is defined as x m 1 f c f x m 1 g c g because of the l 1 l 1 boundedness of the maximal operator for a constant c large enough we have 1 multiple vector valued inequalities via the helicoidal method 33 we partition the collection of tri tiles according to the scaled distance from the exceptional set pd p p 1 dist ip c ip 2 d and we will prove estimates equivalent to 46 for the family pd with an extra 2 10 d decay 47 bht pd f g h 2 10 d f 1 p g 1 q h 1 s we suppress the d dependency for the moment but all the subcollections i nj j and i n 1 n 2 n 3 will actually depend on this parameter at the very end we sum in d and use interpolation so that the final estimate depends only on the fixed interval i 0 and the fixed sets f g h now we construct a collection in 1 n 1 n 1 of relevant dyadic intervals according to the concentration of 1 f start with n 1 so that 2 n 1 2 d f and let p n 1 1 p here p n 1 will play the role of stock or collection of available tiles define in 11 to be the collection of maximal dyadic intervals i with the property that there exists at least one tile p p n 1 with ip i and 48 1 i 1 f m i dx 2 n 1 for every such interval i let pn 1 i be the collection of tiles p p n 1 with the property that ip i set p n 1 p i i n 1 1 pn 1 i repeat the procedure for all n 1 n 1 i n 1 1 will denote the collection of maximal dyadic intervals which contain a time interval ip for some p p n 1 1 which was not selected previously and so that 2 n 1 1 1 i 1 f m i dx 2 n 1 as before pn 1 i p p n 1 ip i set p n 1 pn 1 1 i i n 1 1 pn 1 i and notice that after a finite number of steps p n 1 note that we always have 2 n 1 2 d f for d sufficiently large the intervals ip for p p d are going to be essentially disjoint and the intervals i in 11 can be selected in an easier way but this is not the case for example when d 0 which corresponds to ip c 6 however for every n 1 the intervals in i n 1 1 are going to be disjoint and this is going to be used later in the proof similarly i n 2 2 denotes the collection of maximal dyadic intervals i containing at least some ip i for some p p d and 1 i 1 g m i dx 2 n 2 2 d g for 1 h i n 3 3 collection of maximal dyadic intervals i containing at least some ip for some p pd and so that 1 i 1 h m i dx 2 n 3 2 md 34 cristina benea and camil muscalu we denote in 1 n 2 n 3 i n 1 1 i n 2 2 i n 3 3 and we further partition p d as pd n 1 n 2 n 3 i in 1 n 2 n 3 p i for i in 11 we have s ize pn 1 i 1 f 2 n 1 when we consider the intersection i of different intervals in i n 1 1 i n 2 2 and i n 3 3 all we can say is that s ize p i 1 f 2 n 1 this fact is the technical obstruction in obtaining vector valued bht estimates for any p q s in the whole range of bht in a similar way the relation 1 i r 1 f m i dx 2 n 1 for i in 11 becomes for an interval i

q there are four distinct cases i 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r 1 2 in this case if we pick 1 2 0 and 3 1 all the conditions hold and the range of lp estimates for bht r is going to be the convex hull of the points

g x h x l w 1 h all the details are identical to the case r 1 the restrictions are given by only two inequalities 1 1 2 1 r 1 1 2 2 1 r 2 in the case r 1 r 2 2 r 1 these are automatically satisfied and dr 1 r 2 r range bht when r 1 we use the fact that the adjoint bht 1 of bht is a bilinear operator of the same kind which is bounded from lr lr l 1 more precisely bht fw gw hw r bht fw gw x hw x dx r fw x bht 1 gw hw x dx in proving the boundedness of vector valued bht via interpolation we assume f x l w 1 f x g x lr w 1 g x h x lr w 1 h then bht p i fw gw hw bht 1 p i gw 1 g hw 1 h 1 f 1 s

original bht operator itself indeed for 2 3 0 we have 1 2 2 1 2 0 1 3 2 1 2 0 multiple vector valued inequalities via the helicoidal method 37 3 4 iterated lp w spaces estimates for bht previously we proved that for any tuple r 1 r 2 r with 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r 1 r and 1 r 1 r 2 we have bht lp r lr 1 w lq r lr 2 w ls r lr w whenever p q r are in a certain range dr r 1 r 2 which can be described in a precise manner the general ideas for proving multiple vector valued estimates for bht as presented in theorem 8 via the helicoidal method were described in the introduction in this section we present in more detail the proof in the case of two iterated spaces s r in order to simplify the notation first we prove the following localized vector valued result proposition 9 n k 1 bhtp i 0 fk 1 f gk 1 g

proof of theorem 7 from the previous section in constructing the collection of intervals i nj j we note that we only need to select intervals i that are already contained in i 0 because all the tiles in p i 0 are so that ip i 0 as before we prove generalized restricted type estimates and we assume that the functions have the following properties k fk r 1 1 r 1 1 e 1 k fk r 2 1 r 2 1 e 2 k hk r 1 r 1 e 3 the exceptional set is defined by m 1 e 1 c e 1 e 3 m 1 e 2 c e 2 e 3 and we assume the tiles to be so that 1 dist ip c ip 2 d for intervals i in 11 we have 1 i r 1 e 1 1 f m i dx s ize pn 1 i 1

when one of the r 1 r 2 or r follow in a similar manner the above proposition is an intermediate step in the proof of lp estimates for bht r in the case of two iterated vector spaces which is presented below proposition 10 l k bht fkl gkl r s r 1 s t c l k fkl r 1 s 1 r 1 1 s 1 p l k gkl rr s 2 r 2 1 s 2 q proof once again we use generalized restricted type interpolation f g h are sets of

r 2 1 r 2 i s 2 k hkl r 1 r i s 51 then we sum 51 over l as well and apply ho lder for the triple s 1 s 2 s in this way we recover 1 f i s 1 and the corresponding quantities for the second and third

of theorem 9 the paraproduct case is similar to bht even though the bilinear hilbert transform is a much more complicated object the extra difficulties are hidden in propositions 1 but we will see from the proof of the vector valued extensions that the complexity of the paraproduct case is comparable to the local l 2 case for bht in both situations we recover the maximal range for vector valued estimates 40 cristina benea and camil muscalu we will be working with the discrete paraproduct of the functions f and g which is defined by f g x i i 1 i 1 2 f 1 i g 2 i 3 i x here i is a family of dyadic intervals and the wave packets j i i i are so that two of the families are lacunary j i is a wave packet on i 1 i 2 i and the third one is non lacunary j 0 i is a wave packet on i 0 1 i again we present the case of p spaces for simplicity the operator we are interested in is r f g n k 1 fk gk r 1 r remark we could alternatively look at operators of the form f g 7 n k 1 k fk gk r 1 r where each paraproduct k is associated to a family ik of dyadic intervals the ks don t need to be precisely the same but they display a similar behavior similarly for bht we could have a perturbation bhtw for each w w and the method of the proof applies in that case as well 4 1 a few results about paraproducts the concepts of sizes and energies are similar to the corresponding ones for the bilinear hilbert transform we don t need to organize the tiles into trees because the family of tiles is of rank 0 we recall some definitions bellow definition 17 let i be a family of dyadic intervals for any 1 j 3 we define size i f j i i i sup i i f j i i 1 2 if j i i is non lacunary and size i f j i i i sup i 0 i 1 i 0 1 2 i i 0 i i f j i 2 i 1 i 1 2 1 if j i i is lacunary similarly to the bht case energy is defined as energy j i f j i i i sup n z 2 n sup d i d i where d ranges over all collections of disjoint intervals i 0 with the property that f j i 0 i 0 1 2 2 n if j i i is non lacunary and respectively 1 i 0 1 2 i i 0 i i f j i 2 i 1 i 1 2 1 2 n if j i i is lacunary we have estimates similar to lemma 1 and lemma 2 however because we don t need to use orthogonality of trees the energy becomes an l 1 quantity multiple vector valued inequalities via the helicoidal method 41 lemma 6 lemma 2 13 of ms 13 if f is an l 1 function and 1 j 3 then size j i f j i i i sup i i 1 i r f mi dx for m 0 with implicit constants depending on m lemma 7 lemma 2 14 of ms 13 if f is an l 1 function and 1 j 3 then energy j i f j i i i f 1 proposition 11 proposition 2 12 of ms 13 given a paraproduct associated with a family i of intervals f 1 f 2 f 3 i i 1 i 1 2 f 1 1 i f 2 2 i f 3 3 i 3 j 1 size j i fj j i i i 1 j energy j i fj j i i i j for any 0 1 2 3 1 such that 1 2 3 1 where the implicit constant depends on 1 2 3 only while the above proposition is the main ingredient we need localized estimates if i 0 is some fixed dyadic interval then we define i 0 f g x i i i i 0 1 i 1 2 f 1 i g 2 i 3 i x here again we need some localization results which play the role of proposition 8 and corollary 1 from the bht case the trilinear form associated to the localized paraproduct is given by f g h i 0 f g h i 0 f 1 f g 1 g h 1 h proposition 12 let i 0 be a fixed dyadic interval and f g h r sets of finite measure then there exist some positive numbers 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 1 so that f g h i 0 f g h s ize i i 0 1 f a 1 s ize i i 0 1 g a 2 s ize i i 0 1 h a 3 f i 0 r 1 g i 0 r 2 h i 0 r whenever 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r 1 and 1 r 1 r 2 r here aj 1 1 rj proof the idea of the proof is very similar to that of proposition 7 restricted type estimates are proved by performing a triple stopping time and then the result follows by interpolation we leave the routine details to the reader the case r 1 is obtained through interpolation of restricted type estimates only this comes in contrast with the r 1 case for bht where generalized restricted type inter polation is necessary more exactly for the bht operator in order to conclude estimates for 1 r 1 1 r 2 0 one needs to interpolate between good i 0 and bad 3 0 tuples 1 2 3 42 cristina benea and camil muscalu proposition 13 if h is a fixed set of finite measure 52 i 0 f g 1 h s ize i i 0 1 h f i 0 p g i 0 q whenever 1 p 1 q 1 and 1 p q proof in this case i 0 f g 1 h becomes a bilinear form with respect to the first two entries because of the decay of i 0 it will be sufficient to prove the proposition in the case supp f g 5 i 0 by theorem 12 it will be enough to show restricted type estimates for the bilinear form f g 7 i 0 f g 1 h let f and g be sets of finite measure and f 1 f and g 1 g using proposition 11 with 3 0 and estimating s ize i i 0 f 1 s ize i i 0 g 1 we get i 0 f g 1 h s ize i i 0 1 h f 1 g 2 where 1 2 1 and 0 1 2 1 this proves restricted type estimates in a small neighborhood of 1 p 1 q 4 2 proof of theorem 8 a particular case we will be using vector valued interpolation theorems as usual hence we fix f g and h sets of finite measure and we assume h 1 let f fk k g gk k with k fk r 1 1 r 1 1 f k gk r 2 1 r 2 1 g the exceptional set will be x m 1 f x c f x m 1 g x c g and h h we have a sequence of functions hk k with k hk r 1 r 1 h for every d 0 i d i i 1 dist i c i 2 d when estimating paraproducts associated to the collection id we get an extra 2 10 d decay and thus the d dependency of the paraproducts can be assumed to be implicit as before for each of the sets f g and h we define collections of disjoint maximal intervals j n 11 j n 2 2 and j n 33 respectively for example if i j n 1 1 then 2 n 1 1 1 i r 1 f idx 2 n 1 f returning to the operator r we have for the associated multilinear form k fk gk hk n 1 n 2 n 3 i j n 1 n 2 n 3 k i 0 fk gk hk multiple vector valued inequalities via the helicoidal method 43 now we use the localization results of proposition 12 to estimate the above expression by n 1 n 2 n 3 i 0 j n 1 n 2 n 3 n k 1 s ize i i 0 1 f b 1 s ize i i 0 1 g b 2 s ize i i 0 1 h b 3 fk i

some 0 bj aj which we can do because the sizes are subunitary whenever 0 j 1 are so that 1 2 3 1 i 0 j n 1 n 2 n 3 i 0 2 n 1 f 1 2 n 2 g 2 2 n 3 h 3 adding all the pieces together we have k fk gk hk n 1 n 2 n 3 2 n 1 b 1 1 p 1 2 n 2 b 2 1 q 2 2 n 3 b 3 1 r 3 f 1 g 2 f 1 p g 1 q of course the last inequality is true provided we can choose 1 2 3 so that the series converges choosing the js and js carefully one can prove that the restricted weak type estimates hold arbitrary close to the points 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 and 1 1 1 then the general result follows by interpolation remark with a few adjustments the proof is valid in the case r 1 as well 5 tensor products bht n in this section we will prove the boundedness of the tensor product bht n bht lp rn 1 lq rn 1 lr rn 1 whenever 1 r 1 p 1 q with 2 3 r 1 p q if t 1 l p rn 1 lq rn 1 lr rn 1 and t 2 l p rn 2 lq rn 2 lr rn 2 are two bilinear operators then the tensor product t 1 t 2 l p rn 1 n 2 lq rn 1 n 2 lr rn 1 n 2 will act as t 1 in the first variable and as t 2 in the second variable in our case the operators are given by singular multipliers and in this situation we can give a characterization of the tensor product assume t 1 f g x r 2 n 1 f 1 g 2 m 1 1 2 e 2 ix 1 2 d 1 d 2 and similarly t 2 f g y r 2 n 2 f 1 g 2 m 2 1 2 e 2 iy 1 2 d 1 d 2 44 cristina benea and camil muscalu then the multiplier of the tensor product is precisely m 1 1 2 m 2 1 2 t 1 t 2 f g x y f 1 1 g 2 2 m 1 1 2 m 2 1 2 e 2 ix 1 2 e 2 iy 1 2 d 1 d 2 d 1 d 2 the multiplier associated with bht is sgn 1 2 while the multiplier of a paraproduct of two functions on the real line is a classical marcinkiewicz mikhlin ho rmander multiplier m 1 2 smooth away from the origin satisfying the condition m for sufficiently many multi indices the decay in m and a fourier series decomposition allows one to approximate the multiplier by a finite number of sums of the form k k 1 k 2 k 1 2 k k 1 k 2 k 1 2 or k k 1 k 2 k 1 2 recall that qk is the littlewood paley projection onto 2 k which is really the convolution with k and pk is the projection onto 2 k corresponding to the convolution with k then we can regard paraproducts as being expressions of the form 53 k qk pkf qkg x y k qk qkf pkg x y or k pk qkf qkg x y it is important in the following proofs that the outer most function k 1 2 and k 1 2 are identically equal to 1 on the supports of k 1 k 2 and k 1 k 2 respectively this can always be achieved with the price of an extra decomposition proposition 14 let tm l p rn lq rn lr rn be a bilinear operator with smooth symbol m and lp r lq r lr r a paraproduct as described above 1 if is given by kqk pkf qkg x y then tm f g x y k q 2 k tm p y k f q y kg x k tm p y k f q y kg x 2 if is given by k pk qkf qkg x y then tm f g x y k p 2 k tm q y kf q

rua 10 lemma 8 let f s rn and 1 l n and i 1 il 1 n then f lp k 1 kl qi 1 k 1 q il kl f 2 1 2 lp for any 0 p lemma 8 above states that the lp norm of f is bounded by the lp norm of a square function associated with the variables xi 1 xil even when 0 p 1 in the case p 1 it is well known that the two norms are equivalent when p 1 the proof makes use of multi parameter hardy spaces 5 1 proof of theorem 6 proof we start with the proof in the case bht in order to make the presentation clear a assume that f g kqk pkf qkg then proposition 14 implies that bht f g x y k q 2 kbht p y k f q y kg x lemma 8 yields bht ls r 2 k q 2 kbht p y k f q y kg 2 1 2 ls r 2 for the paraproducts that we are considering qk pkf qkg y pkf y qkg y so we need to estimate k bht p y k f q y kg 2 1 2 ls r 2 we first estimate the ls norm of x 7 k bht p y k f q y kg x 2 1 2 and fubini will imply the desired result for bht here we use the vector valued extension for the bilinear hilbert transform bht lp lq 2 ls 2 46 cristina benea and camil muscalu which holds whenever p q s range bht more exactly bht ls r 2 k bht p y k f q y kg x 2 1 2 lsx lsy sup k p y k f lpx k q y kg 2 1 2 l q x lsy sup k p y k f lpx l p y k q y k g 2 1 2 l q x l q y f p g q to get the conclusion we are using fubini again and the boundedness of the maximal and square function operators b the case f g k pk qkf qkg is more direct but the ideas are similar the functions in the paraproduct definition are so that f g k qkf qkg so we have bht f g x y k bht q y k f q y k g x now we use the vector valued extension bht lp 2 lq 2 ls 1 which is well defined for any p q s range bht together with fubini and the boundedness of the square function to get bht ls r 2 k bht q y k f q y k g x lsx lsy k q y k f 2 1 2 lpx k q y k g 2 1 2 l q x lsy f p g q the general case of theorem 6 is similar but slightly more technical we present it below for completeness the paraproducts can be of three types as seen in 53 this generates a partition of 1 n into three subsets of indices i 1 i 2 and i 3 so that if k i 1 then f g y k qk pkf qkg y and similarly for i 2 and i 3 because the projections on different coordinates commute i e qikp j l p j l qik and q i kq j l q j l qik we can assume i 1 1 l i 2 l 1 l d i 3 l d 1 n of course we allow the possibility that one or even two of these sets of indices are empty with this assumption proposition 14 applied iteratively yields bht f g x y 1 yn k 1 kn q 1 k 1 q l kl q kl 1 l 1 ql d kl d p l d 1 kl d 1 pnkn bht p y 1 k 1 p yl kl q yl 1 kl 1 q yn kn f q y 1 k 1 q yl kl pkl 1 p yl d kl d q k yl d 1 l

norms and square functions here we want to apply proposition 8 so we need to multiple vector valued inequalities via the helicoidal method 47 deal with the qk functions first once we do this we can estimate the l r norm of bht f g by k 1 kl d kl d 1 kn p l d 1 kl d 1 p n knbht p y 1 k 1 q yl 1 kl 1 f q y 1 k 1 p yl 1 kl 1 q k yl d 1 l d 1 g 2 1 2 r k 1 kl d kl d 1 kn bht p y 1 k 1 q yl 1 kl 1 f q y 1 k 1 p yl 1 kl 1 q k yl d 1 l d 1 g 2 1 2 r f p g q for the last part we used the following vector valued estimates for the bht lp l 2 2 d 2 2 n l d lq 2 2 l d 2 2 n l d 7 ls 2 2 l 2 2 d 1 1 n l d together with the boundedness of the maximal operator and square function similarly we can obtain estimates for d 1 bht d 2 within the same range as that of bht some partial results in mixed norm lp spaces can be obtained too but the general case for arbitrary values of d 1 and d 2 remains open we present a few particular cases that illustrates the main ideas without being too technical i here we prove mixed norm lp estimates for 1 bht 3 where 1 k q 1 k p 1 k q 1 k 3 l q 3 l q 3 l p 3 l and the exponents pj qj 2 we note that 1 bht 3 f g x y z k l q 1 kq 3 lbht p x kq z l f q x kp z l g y and we want to estimate the above expression in the space ls 1 x l s 2 y l s 3 z the key observation is that whenever 1 s 2 s 3 54 k l q 1 kq 3 l f x y z l s 1 x l s 2 y l s 3 z k l q 1 kq 3 l f x y z 2 1 2 l s 1 x l s 2 y l s 3 z which is a banach valued equivalent of lemma 8 this result for s 1 1 can be found in fer 87 and rdfrt 86 and it follows from the boundedness of caldero n zygmund operators the dual of the square function is such an operator on lp spaces with mixed norms the proof in the case s 1 1 is a banach space adaptation of the proof of lemma 8 given the special properties of the q 1 k and q 3 l operators we obtain 1 bht 3 f g l s 1 x l s 2 y l s 3 z k l bht p xkq z l f q x kp z l g y 2 1 2 l s 1 x l s 2 y l s 3 z the multiple vector valued estimates bht lp 2 y l p 3 z 2 lq 2 y

of convolution operators since our proof makes use of multiple vector valued estimates for bht we cannot obtain mixed norm lp estimates for all the exponents in the banach range from the above example one can see that besides the constraints imposed by the square functions and maximal operators we also need p 3 q 3 s 3 dp 2 q 2 s 2 ii if d 1 0 and d 2 1 we have bht lp 1 x l p 2 y l q 1 x l q 2 y l s 1 x l s 2 y whenever 1 p 2 q 2 s 2 1 p 1 q 1 2 3 s 1 and p 2 q 2 s 2 dp 1 q 1 s 1 iii if d 1 1 and d 2 0 we have bht lp 1 x l p 2 y l q 1 x l q 2 y l s 1 x l s 2 y whenever 1 p 2 q 2 s 2 1 p 1 q 1 1 2 s 1 since the target spaces that is inner spaces in the mixed norms are strictly between 1 and the outer l cases that is p 1 or q 1 follow easily from similar estimates on the adjoints we note that mixed norm estimates for bht appear also in dpo 15 where all the inner spaces involved are lp spaces with 1 p in our notation that means 1 p 2 q 2 s 2 6 leibniz rules theorem 4 now we present some

estimate in lp spaces with mixed norms as long as the outside functions k and k are constantly equal to 1 on 2 k 2 2 k 2 and 2 k 2 respectively the operators are slightly different but using fourier series we can write f g as f g 7 n z cn k l f k l g k l k l n x y multiple vector valued inequalities via the helicoidal method 49 here the coefficients cn n m and k n x k x 2 kn now notice that the rhs above becomes n cn l q 2 l p y l n f q y l n g x which is a superposition of operators the proof of the leibniz rule follows from 1 multiple vector valued estimates for the paraproduct f g l f l g l l 2 the boundedness of the shifted maximal and square functions sup l f l n p log n f p l f l n 2 1 2 p log n f p returning to the leibniz rules we have for s 1 s 2 1 d 1 d 2 f g ls 2 y l s 1 x n cn l q 2 l p y l nf q y l ng ls 2 y l s 1 x n cn l 1 2 p y l n f q y l n g 2 1 2 ls 2 y l s 1 x n cn sup l p y l n f lp 2 y l p 1 x l q y l n g 2 1 2 lq 2 y l q 1 x f lp 1 x l p 2 y d 1 d 2 g lq 1 x l q 2 y here we used the vector valued estimates lp 1 x lp 2 y lq 1 x lq 2 y 2 ls 1 x ls 2 y 2 as well as the boundedness of the square function and maximal operator we note that the square function is in the y variable and for that reason at first we cannot allow p 2 or q 2 however this obstruction can be removed by using duality the same proof works in the case 1 2 s 1 1 if 1 p 2 q 2 in this case we use the subadditivity of s 1 s 1 the case 1 2 s 1 1 and p 2 requires a slightly different reasoning and can be deduced from the corresponding mixed norm estimates for this will be presented at the end of this section a slightly more difficult case of the leibniz rule is when one of the last components is a type function d 1 d 2 f g x y k l f k l g l l d 1 k d 2 l x y k l f k l g k l 2 k k 2 l l x y 50 cristina benea and camil muscalu in this case k 2 k k but doesn t behave as nicely as it is not smooth at the origin and for that reason its decay is much slower x 1 1 x 1 we use a fourier series decomposition of k on its support k n z cne 2 in 2 k k where cn 1 2 k r k e 2 in 2 k d in this case we only have cn 1 n 1 but this is enough for the coefficients to sum up if s 1 1 1 since s 2 1 we will not have a similar issue when doing the decomposition in the second variable following the same line of ideas the problem reduces to estimating n cn k p 1 k qxk nf q x k ng y and it would imply mixed square functions estimates of the form n qxk ng 2 1 2 l q 1 x l q 2 y this is bounded as long as 1 q 1 q 2 and in order to recover the case pi or qi we want to make sure that the square functions are in the inner most variable which is y so we need a decomposition of l as before also we will need vector valued estimates for the generalized paraproduct f g 7 k f k g k k where the last component has slow decay the vector spaces involved are 2 2 or 2 2 1 and such estimates can be proved using ideas similar to those in section 4 modulo standard technical difficulties as discussed in ms 13 we now present the proof of the mixed norm estimates for the biparameter paraproducts proof of theorem 5 since the other case are very similar we can assume that y the paraproduct acting on the variable y is of the form y k qk pk qk then we can write as f g x y kq 2 k p y k q y k x then we have k q 2 k p y k q y k x l s 2 y l s 1 x k p y k q y k x 2 1 2 l s 2 y l s 1 x sup k p yk f x l p 2 y l p 1 x k qykg x 2 1 2 l q 2 y l q 1 x multiple vector valued inequalities via the helicoidal method 51 in the above inequality we used the multiple vector valued estimate x l p 1 x lp 2 y lq 1 x lq 2 y 2 ls 1 x ls 2 y 2 which is a consequence of theorem 9 now we focus on the case p 2 1 q 2 q since q 2 is symmetric we want to prove that lp 1 x l y l q 1 x l q y l s 1 x l q y by using banach valued restricted type interpolation that is for any f g h sets of finite measure we can find a major subset h h and we will prove that 55 r 2 f g x y h x y dxdy f 1 g 2 h 3 for any functions f g and h satisfying f x l y 1 f x g x lqy 1 g x h x lq y 1 h x and 1 2 3 any tuple satisfying 1 2 3 1 situated in the neighborhood of 1 p 1 1 p 2 1 p a triple stopping time similar to the one appearing in the proof of theorem 7 will allow us to recover any exterior l pj x norms while the interior norms are fixed l y l q y l q y we will consider localizations of the paraproduct acting on the x variable more exactly the following estimate the proof of which is a combination of proposition 12 and lp estimates for is key if i 0 is a fixed dyadic interval then f g h i 0 l x l y l q xl q y l q xl q y with operatorial norm f g h i 0 l x l y l q xl q y l q xl q y f g h i 0 1 l q x l q y l q xl q y l 1 xl 1 y the latter is bounded above by f g h i 0 1 l q x l q y l q xl q y l 1 xl 1 y s ize i 01 h 1 q s ize i 01 g 1 q s ize i 01 f 1 which is a consequence of the localized multiple vector valued estimates that always appear in the iterative step of the helicoidal method more exactly we have f g hi 0 f g x y h x y dxdy s ize i 01 h 1 q s ize i 01 g 1 q s ize i 01 f 1 h x l q y i 0 l q x g x lqy i 0 l q x f l x l y this implies after performing the usual stopping times that r 2 f g x y h x y dxdy n 1 n 2 n 3 i 0 r 2 f g h i 0 f g x y h x y dxdy n 1 n 2 n 3 i 0 s ize i 01 f 1 s ize i 01 g 1 s ize i 01 h 1 i 0 from here the desired lp estimates follow almost immediately 52 cristina benea and camil muscalu 7 rubio de francia theorem for iterated fourier integrals we end by answering the initial question that motivated the study of vector valued bht more exactly we prove theorem 10 which is a consequence of theorem 7 with r 1 r 2 chosen carefully so that 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r proof of theorem 10 we start with the case r 2 this follows from theorem 7 56 k bht pikf pikg x 2 1 2 s k pikf r 1 1 r 1 p k pikg r 2 1 r 2 q for any 1 p q 2 3 s this is implied by rubio de francia s theorem if one can find r 1 and r 2 with 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 2 and 1 p 1 r 1 1 q 1 r 2 this is possible as long as 1 s 1 p 1 q 1 r 1 1 r 2 3 2 which coincides with the condition that we have for the range of bht the case 1 r 2 is similar for p q and s as above one needs to find r 1 and r 2 2 so that 2 1 r 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 p 1 q note that 1 p 1 r 1 1 1 r 1 r 2 1 r 1 2 and similarly for q because of this restriction the operator tr is bounded as long as admissible triple 1 p 1 q 1 s is in the convex hull of the points 0 0 1 1 2 1 r 1 2 1 r 1 2 1 2 1 r 1 r 1 2 1 r 0 1 2 1 r 0 1 2 1 r 1 2 1 r remark an alternative way of proving the boundedness of tr within the range mentioned in theorem 10 is by interpolating between lp 1 lq 1 ls 1 2 with p 1 q 1 s 1 in the range of the bht operator and 57 lp 2 lq 2 ls 2 1 with p 2 q 2 1 s 2 1 58 7 1 boundedness of operators m 1 and m 2 in what follows we prove the boundedness of operators m 1 and m 2 presented in 14 and 15 m 1 f 1 f 2 g x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 l x 3 r f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 g x 3 e 2 i x 1 x 2 x 3 dx 1 dx 2 dx 3 and m 2 f 1 f 2 g x 1 l l x 2 l x 3 r f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 g x 3 e 2 i x 1 x 2 x 3 dx 1 dx 2 dx 3 for both operators we are going to use the triangle inequality in lr the target space for operators m 1 and m 2 however if r 1 this inequality is not available anymore for the multiple vector valued inequalities via the helicoidal method 53 quasi norm r and instead we use the triangle inequality for r r this is the only difference between the banach and quasi banach case and for simplicity we assume r 1 also as previously stated we assume g p 1 proposition 15 let 1 p 2 and 1 r 1 s 1 p 1 p 1 1 p 2 1 p then m 1 f 1 f 2 g r f 1 p 1 f 2 p 2 g p proof recall that d is the mesh of dyadic intervals contained in 0 1 and we identify them with their preimage 1 we rewrite m 1 as m 1 f 1 f 2 g bht p lf 1 p lf 2 g 1 r then m 1 f 1 f 2 g r k 0 2 k bht p lf 1 p lf 2 g 1 r r k 0 2 k bht p lf 1 p lf 2 p 1 p 2 k g 1 r p 1 p r k 0 2 k bht p lf 1 p lf 2 p 1 p s 2 k g 1 r p p 1 p we estimate g 1 r p g 1 r p 2 k p using the hausdorff young theorem also there are 2 k dyadic intervals of length 2 k in 0 1 and because of this m 1 f 1 f 2 g r k 0 2 k 1 p 1 p 2 k bht p lf 1 p lf 2 p 1 p s if we estimate the last term using the operator tp directly we will not obtain the full range stated above as there will appear extra constraints of the type 1 p 1 1 p 3 2 1 p 2 1 p 3 2 instead using ho lder and the fact that 1 p 2 we have bht p lf 1 p lf 2 p bht p lf 1 p lf 2 2 2 k 1 p 1 2 using the boundedness of t 2 we have m 1 f 1 f 2 g r k 0 2 k 1 2 1 p f 1 p 1 f 2 p 2 proposition 16 let 1 p 2 and 1 r 1 s 1 p 1 p 1 1 p 2 1 p then m 2 f 1 f 2 g r f 1 p 1 f 2 p 2 g p provided 1 p 2 1 p 1 54 cristina benea and camil muscalu proof first we remark that m 2 f 1 f 2 g cf 1 p lf 2 g r where c is the carleson operator bounded on lp whenever 1 p from here on the estimates are similar to those in proposition 15 but instead of the bilinear operator tr f g we will have to use the more restrictive rubio de francia operator rf m 2 f 1 f 2 g r k 0 cf 1 2 k p lf 2 p 1 p 2 k g 1 r p 1 p r

restrictions in the case p 2 2 rubio de francia requires 1 1 p 2 1 this and the condition 1 1 p 0 so that the geometric series above is finite can be summarized as 1 p 2 1 p 1 references bat 13
