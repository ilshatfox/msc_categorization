an asymptotic formula for the fourier transform of the arithmetic sur face measure associated to the waring goldbach problem and provide several applications including bounds for discrete spherical maximal functions along the primes and distribution results such as ergodic theorems 1 introduction in this paper we study several questions on the interface between harmonic analysis and analytic number theory our results are motivated in part by the study of discrete maximal functions in harmonic analysis in part by applications of those maximal functions in ergodic theory and in part by connections to classical problems in analytic number theory in particular the waring goldbach problem the harmonic analytic motivation behind our work comes from celebrated results by bour gain 4 5 on ergodic averages over certain sequences of integers and later work of magyar stein and wainger 23 on discrete spherical maximal functions driven by applications in ergodic theory bourgain 4 initiated the study of discrete maximal functions a key feature of bourgain s approach is his use of the circle method from analytic number theory with this in mind magyar 19 provided some partial results on

for the maximal operator s they proved that when n 5 s is bounded on ppznq when p n pn 2 q and unbounded when p n pn 2 q furthermore it is shown that this result cannot hold when n 5 in their work they took the symbiosis between harmonic analysis and number theory a step further by using a full fledged application of the circle method to analyze the fourier transform of the arithmetic surface

model for several authors 20 2 22 15 who have studied the maximal functions of the discrete surface measures on other arithmetic surfaces over the integers it is also the inspiration for one of the results of the present paper see theorem 1 below however in contrast to earlier work on discrete maximal functions we study the more singular maximal function of the prime points on the k sphere the goal of this paper is to study the distribution of points with prime coordinates on the algebraic surface fpxq xk 1 xkn 1 1 for p n by combining number theoretic techniques from the study of the waring goldbach problem with ideas from harmonic analysis we are able to prove several results on the distribution of such points including an equidistribution theorem an l 2 ergodic theorem and a pointwise ergodic theorem a quantitative version of our equidistribution theorem theorem 3 below is another main result we take the spherical maximal function in a new direction by proving ppznq bounds for a discrete variant along the primes while restrictions of results about integer sequences to the primes are common in both number theory and ergodic theory the study of maximal functions related to the primes has been limited to sequential averages e g 6 31 26 24 25 this paper appears to be the first work on such restricted problems in harmonic analysis related to prime points on forms in many variables the new obstacles arising in these problems require further development of the bourgain magyar stein wainger paradigm of using the circle method to decompose the maximal operator and thus to reduce the problem to estimates for exponential sums and integrals earlier works have been able to employ a classical variant of the circle method which uses the poisson summation formula to estimate the major arc contribution the restriction to primes forces us to draw on our knowledge about equidistribution of primes in arithmetic progressions and to employ more primitive tools compared to poisson summation to do so therefore in order to be able to obtain any result at all we blend mean 2 value theorems of vinogradov s type into our minor arc analysis in contrast in problems over unrestricted integers previous approaches were able to rely merely on l 8 bounds for the relevant exponential sums indeed insights gained from this present work have already led us to improve in 1 on the results of the third author 15 16 on unrestricted integer points on the k sphere the study of prime points p pp 1 pnq p pn here p is the set of primes on the surface 1 1 is known in number theory as the waring goldbach problem classic work by hua 14 established the asymptotic for the number of representations of a large natural number as a sum of n kth powers of primes when k and n are positive integers such that n 2 k and belongs to an appropriate infinite arithmetic progression n k write log x plog x 1 q plog xnq and let rp q denote the number of prime solutions of 1 1 counted with logarithmic weights rp q fppq logp where and through the remainder of the paper p denotes a vector in pn using the hardy littlewood circle method hua proved that when 8 one has the asymptotic rp q sn kp q n k 1 1 2 where sn kp q is a product of local densities sn kp q p 8 pp q here pp q with p 8 is related to the solubility of 1 1 over the p adic field qp and 8 p q to solubility over the reals in particular the set n k is determined by the requirement that pp q 0 for all primes p some examples of progressions n k see chapter viii in hua 14 for more details including the full definition of n k include n k is the residue class n pmod 2 q when k is odd 5 2 is the residue class 5 pmod 24 q 17 4 is the residue class 17 pmod 240 q the starting point to our main results lies in extending 1 2 to an approximation formula for the fourier transform of the arithmetic probability measure pxq 1 rp q 1 tpppn fn kppq upxq logx defined when rp q 0 the fourier transform of this measure is the exponential sum x p q 1 rp q fppq plogpqepp q 1 3 we note that x is defined only for sufficiently large p n k and n sufficiently large in terms of k based on the current state of affairs in the waring goldbach problem 17 18 the latter means that for large k the value of n must be at least as large as 4 k log k in reality the true size of rp q is only known for n k 2 k op kq so it only makes sense to study the fourier transform x p q when n k 2 k our first theorem is a variant of the magyar stein wainger theorem above for the fourier transform 1 3 before stating the result we need to introduce some notation given an 3 integer q 1 we write zq z qz and uq z q the group of units if q pq 1 qnq p zn with q 1 by which we mean that qi 1 for all i we write uq uq 1 uqn it is also convenient to set a q pa 1 q 1 an qnq and aq pa 1 q 1 anqnq if a pa 1 anq is another vector in zn given p z and a q p zn with q 1 we now define gpa q b rq 1 prq rsq xpurq rs e axk q bx r sp a qq 8 q 1 apuq ep a qq n i 1 gpa q ai qiq where is euler s totient function and rq rs lcmrq rs we fix a smooth bump function such that 1 qpxq pxq 1 qpx 2 q where 1 q is the indicator function of the cube q r 1 1 sn and we write hpxq phxq for h 0 we also define n 1 pkq minp 2 k k 2 kq 3 theorem 1 approximation formula let k 2 and n n 1 pkq also let p n k be large and suppose that 1 k n 1 k for any fixed b 0 there exists a c cpbq 0 such that one has the decomposition x p q n k 1 rp q 1 q q apuq sp a qq n qpq aq d p a qq xe p q 1 4 where q plognqc d is the fourier transform of the k spherical surface measure on the surface defined by 1 1 in rn pcf 3 12 q and the convolution operators e associated with the error terms xe p q satisfy the maximal inequality sup 2 e 2 pznq 2 pznq plog q b 1 5 for all 0 note that 1 5 implies that xe l 8 ptnq plog q b 1 6 we remark that the proof of theorem 1 allows us to establish 1 6 in a slightly wider range of dimension n than the theorem does for the stronger bound 1 5 namely if 2 m is any even integer such that one can apply the circle method to establish the asymptotic formula in waring s problem for 2 m kth powers then 1 6 holds for n 2 m 1 in particular using recent advances by bourgain 7 and wooley 32 we obtain 1 6 for n n 0 pkq where n 0 pkq 2 k 1 when k 2 3 or 4 and n 0 pkq k 2 3 max 1 j k 1 r kj minp 2 j j 2 jq k j 1 v when k 5 these observations are useful in our next result which describes the decay of x at irrational frequencies theorem 2 let k 2 and n n 0 pkq if r qn then x p q 0 as 8 along n k 4 let rp q denote the number of prime points on the k sphere 1 1 it follows readily from theorem 2 that when r qn one has lim 8 p n k 1 rp q fppq epp q 0 1 7 this gives a pair of interesting corollaries the first is obtained by noting that 1 7 is precisely the weyl criterion for uniform distribution on a torus corollary 1 let k 2 n n 0 pkq and p przqqn the sets tp 1 p 1 npnq fppq u become uniformly distributed with respect to the lebesgue measure on the n dimensional torus tn as 8 along n k our second corollary is an l 2 convergence result regarding certain ergodic averages as in section 4 of 20 where the analogous integral result is proven this follows from the spectral theorem for unitary operators to state this corollary let px q denote a probability space with a commuting family of n invertible measure preserving transformations t pt 1 tnq such a family is referred to as a fully ergodic family of transformations if the hypothesis t s 1 f t s 2 f t snf f where s p n and f p l 2 px q implies that f is constant here tf should be interpreted as f t as observed in 20 the notion of full ergodicity is actually a condition on the joint spectrum of the ti more precisely full ergodicity implies that given f p l 2 px q if tif ep iqf holds with i rational for all i n then f is constant almost everywhere for a function f x c p n k and x p x define the waring goldbach ergodic averages on x with respect to t by a fpxq 1 rp q fppq plogpqfpt pxq 1 8 where tmx tm 11 tmnn x for m pm 1 mnq p zn corollary 2 l 2 mean ergodic theorem let k 2 n n 0 pkq and let px q be a prob ability space with a fully ergodic family of transformations t pt 1 tnq then for all f p l 2 px q the ergodic averages of f defined by 1 8 converge in l 2 px q to the space average of f that is one has that lim 8 p n k a f x f d in l 2 px q remark 1 as observed in section 3 of 20 this result does not hold in general if one omits the full ergodicity condition to prove the ergodic theorems we consider the convolution operator a with fourier multiplier x for functions f zn c we write a f f 1 9 5 this is our discrete spherical averaging operator along the primes we will use the approx imation formula to prove a maximal theorem stated below in the remaining theorems define n 2 pkq k 2 pk 1 q 1 for k 7 and n 2 pkq k 2 k 1 1 for 2 k 6 also define pk n 1 n 2 pkq 2 n n 2 pkq 2 n 2 n n 2 pkq theorem 3 let k 2 and n maxtn 1 pkq n 2 pkqu the maximal function given by a f sup p n k a f 1 10 is bounded on ppznq for all p pk n remark 2 in sufficiently large dimensions the maximal function a is unbounded on ppznq for p n n k this can readily be seen by testing the maximal function on a delta function at the origin and using the asymptotic for rp q as 8 in n k with this in mind we conjecture that a should be bounded on ppznq for all p n n k in sufficiently large dimensions this is the same conjectured range of p as for the integral maximal function we refer the reader to 15 for more information on the conjectured range of ppznq boundedness for the integral maximal function remark 3 in the quadratic case the magyar stein wainger theorem holds for n 5 whereas ours only holds for n 7 theorem 3 does match the magyar stein wainger theorem in the range of p and both ranges are sharp an aspect of this work is that for improvements to the value of dimension and pk n in the integer setting automatically translate to corresponding improvements to n 2 pkq and pk n in our setting we used our tech niques to improve the range of dimension and pk n in the integer setting when the degree k is sufficiently large in a forthcoming paper 1 we take this moment to describe the proof of our maximal theorem and to compare it with previous works throughout the paper we follow the paradigms of 4 as embellished in the integral version of our averages in 23 and 20 in particular we assume that the reader is familiar with the transference technology of 23 as in 23 our maximal theorem will exploit the approximation formula which decomposes x xm xe into the sum of a main term and error term we will use separate techniques to get good bounds on the suprema over of both the main term and error term as in all previous works our decomposition requires a major arc minor arc decomposition of the degree k frequency variable unlike previous works we require an additional major arc minor arc decomposition of the linear frequency variables for the main term we will use estimates for relevant exponential sums and oscillatory integrals in addition to the transference results of 23 to bound the main term however as already mentioned the methods in previous works such as 23 15 16 are insufficient to handle the error term from our circle method approximation in the approximation formula this is due to the logarithmic decay in 1 5 as opposed to power savings that appeared in previous works to overcome this obstacle we introduce a hybrid sup and mean value bound to control the relevant exponential sums on our set of minor arcs and consequently bound the error term in 2 this is one of the novel aspects of our paper from this the known bounds for the integer case in 23 and the bounds we are able to proe for the main term on p we are able to bound the analogue of the magyar stein wainger discrete spherical maximal function along the primes 6 following magyar 21 and bourgain 4 we will use our maximal theorem to prove the following pointwise ergodic theorem along the primes theorem 4 let k 2 n maxtn 1 pkq n 2 pkqu and let px q be a probability space with a fully ergodic family of transformations t pt 1 tnq then for all f p l 2 px q the ergodic averages of f defined by 1 8 converge almost everywhere to the space average of f that is lim 8 p n k a f x f d 1 11 almost everywhere again a standard argument see for instance 31 implies the same result without the logarithmic weights corollary 3 suppose that px q is a probability space with n commuting measure preserving operators t 1 tn satisfying the conditions of theorem 4 then for all f p l 2 px q one has lim 8 p n k 1 rp q fppq fpt pxq x f d 1 12 almost everywhere combining our pointwise ergodic theorem on 2 with our maximal function bounds we immediately obtain via standard approximation arguments the following corollary corollary 4 suppose that px q is a probability space with n commuting measure preserving transformations t 1 tn as in theorem 4 then for p pk n and for all f p lppx q one has lim 8 p n k a f x f d 1 13 almost everywhere the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we collect some needed number theoretic facts then in section 3 we use the circle method to decompose x into a main term and an error term we also prove 2 bounds on the error in this section one key additional technical difficulty here compared with the work in 23 is that the precise shape of our error terms is more complicated than in the integral case in particular we need to perform a major and minor arc analysis of the linear phases in addition to the higher degree phases in section 4 we develop a careful analysis and interpolation argument to get p bounds on the main term since we cannot apply the techniques in 23 directly in section 5 we compare the averages along the primes to the integral ones to control the error terms and prove theorem 3 finally we prove the ergodic theorems in section 6

prove some results from analytic number theory lemma 1 let a b q be integers with gcdpa b qq 1 then for any fixed 0 one has xpuq e axk bx q q 1 2 proof this is a special case of theorem 1 of

is a constant proof this is a variant of theorem 1 in harman 13 where the exponent of 21 2 k is replaced by 41 k at the expense of replacing the factor lc above by n the present version is well known to the experts but since we were unable to locate it in the literature we will provide a brief sketch of the argument the proof requires small adjustments to the proofs of lemmas 2 4 in 13 those proofs use the inequality x x rpxqmin y x 1 x x x min y x 1 2 1 where rpxq is the r fold divisor function however in most places the above inequality is used for convenience rather than by necessity the places where this inequality is really needed occur towards the ends of the proofs of lemmas 3 and 4 in 13 when one wants to apply a standard estimate e g lemma 2 2 in vaughan 30 to the sum on the right side of 2 1 in those places we can replace 2 1 with x x rpxqmin y x 1 pxy q 1 2 plogxqc x x min y x 1 1 2 we can then follow the rest of harman s proof lemma 3 let a b q r be integers such that pa qq pb rq 1 and a q 2 n 1 then p n p b pmod rq plog pqep pq nl 3 q 1 n 2 5 qn 1 1 2 proof this is the main result of balog and perelli 3 with some of the terms slightly simplified for use in the present context when 1 q x we define the set of major arcs mpx qq by mpx qq q q apuq p t q a qx 1 the complement of a set of major arcs mpx qq tzmpx qq is the respective set of minor arcs when working with a particular choice of major and minor arcs we may write ma q 8 for the major arc centered at the rational a q note that when 2 q x the set mpx qq is the disjoint union of closed intervals of total measure opqx 1 q our analysis of x p q will depend on the exponential sum snp q p n plog pqep pk pq 2 2 where the summation is over the prime numbers p n in particular we need to ap proximate snp q when both and are near rationals with small denominators the approximations involve the exponential sum gpa q b rq defined above and the oscillatory integral in p q n 0 e xk x dx 2 3 we note that by lemma 1 gpa q b rq rq rs 1 2 2 4 and that the kth derivative estimate for oscillatory integrals proposition 2 on p 332 in stein 28 yields in p q n p 1 nk q 1 k 2 5 furthermore since in p q k 1 n 1 0 u 1 k 1 e 0 u 0 u 1 k du where 0 nk and 0 n we can also apply the second derivative estimate the case k 2 of the corollary on p 334 of 28 to deduce the bound inp q n p 1 n q 1 2 2 6 our next lemma uses the siegel walfisz theorem to approximate snp q lemma 4 let q r plognqc for some fixed c 0 let p ma q for some major arc of the set m mpnk qq and let p nb r for some major arc of the set n

wright 12 lemma 6 let a b q r be integers with pa qq pb rq 1 and write q 0 q pq rq and r 0 r pq rq then i if pr 0 qq 1 one has gpa q b rq 0 ii if pr 0 qq 1 one has gpa q b rq pr 0 q pr 0 q gpark 0 q

r p r 1 by a change of the summation variable x p urq rs in gpa q b rq to x p y rq 1 r 1 sz where y p urq 1 r 1 s and z p up we can factor the exponential sum gpa q b rq as gpa q b rq gpapk q 1 b r 1 qgpa 1 p b 1 p q 2 17 where a 1 arq 1 r 1 skq 11 and b 1 brq 1 r 1 sr 11 we note that pa 1 pq pb 1 pq 1 next we write the variable z p up in gpa 1 p b 1 p q as z u p v where u p up and v p zp this gives pp qgpa 1 p b 1 p q upup e a 1 u k p b 1 u p vpzp e b 1 v p 11 since pb 1 pq 1 the last sum over v vanishes together with the factorization 2 17 this proves i ii when pq r 0 q 1 we change the summation variable x p urq rs in gpa q b rq to x r 0 y qz where y p uq and z p ur 0 similarly to 2 17 we have gpa q b rq gpark 0 q b pq rqq pr 0 q 1 zpur 0 e bq 0 z r 0 we now note that the last exponential sum is a ramanujan sum modulo r 0 and pbq 0 r 0 q 1 hence the claim follows from a classical expression for the ramanujan sum see theorem 272 in hardy and wright 12 iii let hpa q u rq denote the sum over b on the left side of 2 16 by part i we may assume that pq r 0 q 1 we can then use part ii to rewrite hpa q u rq as hpa q u rq pr 0 q pr 0 q pqq xpuq e ark 0 x k q bpur e pr 0 x

when d 2 u the sum over x vanishes on the other hand when d 2 u the condition d pr 0 x uq restricts h to a single residue class modulo d 1 hence the inner sum is then bounded by pqq d 1 we conclude that hpa q u rq 1 pr 0 q pqq d 1 pq rq d 2 pr 0 uq d 1 d 2 pqq d 1 ppq rqq pr 0 q d pr 0 uq d summing the last bound over u we deduce upzr hpa q u rq ppq rqq pr 0 q upzr d pr 0 uq d ppq rqq pr 0 q d r

that we establish a lemma that allows us to leverage our estimates for exponential sums to bound various dyadic maximal functions including the maximal function of the error term lemma 7 let l be a set of integers for p l let t be a convolution operator on 2 pzdq with fourier multiplier xm p q given by xm p q x kp qep p qq d p q 12 where px q is a measure space z x r and kp q p l 1 px q is a

last integral we partition the torus into major and minor arcs let q lc where c 0 is a sufficiently large constant to be described later we set m mpnk qq and m mpnk qq 3 1 the minor arc contribution the minor arc contribution to the integral 3 1 will be part of the error term in the approximation formula let xe 1 p q rp q 1 m f p qep q d 13 since rp q nn k for p n k the estimate 1 5 for xe 1 will follow from lemma 7 if we show that for any b 1 we have m sup ptn f p q d b nn kl b 3 2 when p m it has a rational approximation a q such that q q nkq 1 pa qq 1 and q a q 1 by lemma 2 with fpxq xk x we have sup p qpm t snp q nq 2 1 2 k lck 3 3 where ck is the constant in the statement of lemma 2 using this bound and ho lder s inequality we get m sup ptn f p q d nq 21 2 klck t sup pt snp q n 1 d hence when n n 1 pkq we obtain from lemma 5 that m sup ptn f p q d nn kq 21 2 kln ck we can therefore choose c 1 c 1 pb k nq 0 such that when c c 1 in the definition of q the last inequality yields 3 2 3 2 the major arc contribution i let r q 3 and define r mpn rq n mpn qq r mpn rq n mpn qq we will show that when r nn the contribution of the major arcs m to the integral 3 1 can be estimated similarly to the minor arc contribution suppose that p ma q and write a q then by partial summation snp q hpuq p n p h mod q ep pk pq q qp 1 nk q sup m h p m p h mod q ep pq 3 4 where the supremum is over 2 m n and h p uq when p r it has a rational approximation b r such that r r nr 1 pb rq 1 r b rn 1 3 5 hence we may use lemma 3 to show that sup pm sn p q r 1 2 nql 3 nq 1 3 3 6 on the other hand if p rb r for some major arc in r lemma 4 yields sn p q gpa q b rqinp q o nq 10 where b r when r n we have either r q or r qn 1 when r q 2 4 yields gpa q b rq q 1 2 14 and when r q and r qn 1 2 4 and 2 6 yield gpa q b rqinp q r 1 2 pn q 1 2 nq 1 2 we conclude that inequality 3 6 holds whenever r n thus unless p nn we have the bound 3 6 for some exponential sum sn p jq using that bound in place of 3 3 in the argument of 3 1 we conclude that when c c 2 pb n kq in the definition of q the estimate 1 5 holds for xe 2 p q rp q 1 p q m f p qep q d where p q is any bounded function that is supported outside nn in particular the above inequality holds for p q 1 1 q q apuq n qpq aq where is the bump function appearing in the statement of the approximation formula 3 3 the major arc contribution ii we now proceed to approximate the contribution of the major arcs to 3 1 when lies close to nn for vectors a q with 1 q q and a p uq let na q denote the support of n qpq aq and let n denote the union of all the different sets na q suppose that p 1 nq p na q when p ma q we write a q and j j aj qj by lemma 4 sn p jq gpa q aj qjqinp jq o nq 20 since the major arcs are disjoint we may define the

that the l 8 bound 1 6 holds under a weaker assumption on the dimension the key observation is that to prove 1 6 one does not need to refer to lemma 7 and therefore the inequality m f p q d nn kl b 3 13 can replace 3 2 in the treatment of the minor arcs we can now use 3 3 and the trivial majorization t snp q 2 s d l 2 s t m n ep mkq 2 s d to deduce 3 13 from the results in 6 of 7 provided that k 5 and n n 0 pkq when k 4 the same conclusion follows a sharp form of hua s lemma such as lemma 1 in vaughan 29 4 estimation of the main term contribution in this section we consider the maximal function of the convolution operator whose mul tiplier is the main term in the approximation formula given a sufficiently large p n k let j be the unique integer such that 2 j 1 2 j let m denote the convolution operator with fourier multiplier xm p q 8 q 1 apuq e p a qq q q m a q q p q where m a q q p q apuq n i 1 gpa q ai qiq n qpq aq d p a qq with n 2 j k q plognqc for some large fixed c 0 we write m for the maximal operator defined pointwise as m fpxq sup p n k m fpxq our main objective in this section is to prove the following theorem theorem 5 let k 2 if n maxt 5 k 2 2 u and p n n 2 then the maximal operator m is bounded on ppznq remark 4 note that n 1 pkq n 2 pkq k 2 2 so that these restrictions on the dimension n dominate in theorem 3 in terms of the exponent p our range of p spaces is independent of the degree k 2 and match those of the quadratic case when k 2 for the integral spherical maximal function of magyar stein and wainger 23 in contrast from 15 we know that the integral k spherical maximal functions of magyar 19 are unbounded on lpprnq for p n n k for each k 3 the difference is that in our current setup the analytic piece of the operator see below is more localized in fourier space than it is in previous works this improves its boundedness properties 17 if d rn we introduce the maximal functions m a q d fpxq sup p n k q q qpd m a q q fpxq so that we have the pointwise inequality m fpxq 8 q 1 apuq jpzn m a q dj fpxq 4 1 where dj x p rn 2 ji 1 xi 2 ji 1 i n applying the triangle inequality on ppznq in 4 1 we see that m f ppznq 8 q 1 apuq jpzn ma q dj f ppznq 4 2 next we estimate ma q d f ppznq for a fixed rational number a q and a dyadic box d suppressing the dependence on a q we write mq for the convolution operator m a q q sim ilarly to 4 23 we first decompose each fourier multiplier ymq into an analytic piece and an arithmetic piece let be the bump function from the statement of the approximation formula for q p zn we define the function qp q p 16 q q and note that when is large and q q one has n qpq aq n qpq aq qpq aq we also write gpaq gpa q a qq n i 1 gpa q ai qiq we now define the fourier multipliers xsqp q apuq gpa q a qq qpq aq xt q p q apzn n qpq aq d p a qq so that ymq p q xt q p qxsqp q hence ma q d f ppznq qpd t q psqfq ppznq 4 3 where the maximal function t q is defined by t q fpxq sup p n k t q fpxq the estimation of the sum on the right side of 4 3 is broken into three lemmas first we note that when q q the supports of the functions n qpq aq are disjoint which puts the multipliers t q and t q into the form considered by magyar stein and wainger in section 2 of 23 in particular corollary 2 1 in 23 allows us to transfer the bound in the 18 next lemma to the maximal operators t q there is a technical difference in that our q is composed of different qi that is in magyar stein wainger they consider q pq qq whereas we are considering more general q where often qi qj for i j this however does not present a problem as we apply the magyar stein wainger transference principle in each variable separately lemma 8 if n k 2 2 and p 1 the maximal operator t fpxq sup pn f p 1 kplog q c d qpxq is bounded on lpprnq the proof of this lemma appears in the appendix from this lemma and corollary 2 1 in 23 we deduce that t q psqfq ppznq sqf ppznq thus 4 3 yields ma q d f ppznq qpd sqf ppznq 4 4 note that corollary 2 1 in 23 requires an appropriate choice of banach spaces in order to apply it hence our chosen decomposition of the multiplier and the application of their corollary 2 1 at this point in the proof lemma 9 let d be either a dyadic box of the form dj above or a singleton in z n then for all a q and 0 one has qpd sqf 2 pznq q n 2 qpd wqpqq 2 1 2 f 2 pznq 4 5 where wqpqq n i 1 pq qiq qi lemma 10 for all a q q and 0 one has sqf 1 pznq q wqpqq 1 f 1 pznq 4 6 now we will use the lemmas to complete the proof of theorem 5 we prove lemmas 9 and 10 later in the section and lemma 8 in appendix a first we note that when 1 p 2 interpolation between lemma 10 and the singleton case of lemma 9 yields sqf ppznq q n p 1 wqpqq 1 f ppznq 4 7 where p 1 is the conjugate exponent of p defined by the relation 1 p 1 p 1 1 using 4 4 and 4 7 we obtain ma q d f ppznq qpd sqf ppznq q n p 1 qpd wqpqq 1 f ppznq 4 8 19 for all p 1 on the other hand using 4 4 and lemma 9 we have ma q d f 2 pznq qpd sqf 2 pznq q n 2 qpd wqpqq 2 1 2 f 2 pznq 4 9 when 1 p 2 we can interpolate between 4 9 and 4 8 with p 1 pp 1 q 2 if is defined so that 1 p p 1 q p 1 2 we get ma q d f ppznq q n p 1 1 1 2 f ppznq 4 10 where s qpd wqpqqs 1 s recall that we are interested in the case when d is the cartesian product of intervals r 2 ji 1 2 jiq ji p z and write di 2 ji we have ss n i 1 d q ds rhdi d r r s n i 1 d q d di pd diqs 1 hence by the well known inequality pqq q 1 pqd 1 dnq and 2 pqd 1 dnq n i 1 q q di 1 2 pqd 1 dnq pq dq applying these bounds to the right side of 4 10 we finally obtain ma q d f ppznq q 2 n p 1 pd 1 dnq pq dq f ppznq 4 11 provided that p 1 we now apply 4 11 to all boxes dj that appear on the right side of 4 2 and then sum the resulting bounds over j to find that jpzn ma q dj f ppznq q 2 n p 1 8 j 1 2 j q 2 pq 2 jq 2 n f ppznq 4 12 let j 0 j 0 pqq be the unique index for which 2 j 0 q 2 j 0 1 and note that 4 12 is uniform in a p uq by splitting the series over j at j 0 we deduce that apuq jpzn ma q dj f ppznq q 1 n p 1 2 j j 0 2 j q 2 j j 0 2 jp 2 q n f ppznq q 1 n p 1 2 2 nj 0 f ppznq q 1 n p 1 2 n f ppznq 4 13 provided that 0 2 after choosing 0 sufficiently small theorem 5 is an immediate consequence of 4 2 and 4 12 provided that n p 1 2 that is p n n 2 20 4 1 proofs of the lemmas proof of lemma 9 note that the functions qpq aq with distinct central points a q where q p d have disjoint supports indeed if q 1 pq 1 a 1 q q 2 pq 2 a 2 q 0 with a 1 q 1 a 2 q 2 then for some index i 1 i n we have 1 4 ji 1 q 1 iq 2 i a 1 i q 1 i a 2 i q 2 i a 1 i q 1 i i a 2 i q 2 i i 1 8 pq 1 iq 2 1 8 pq 2 i q 2 1 4 ji a contradiction hence plancherel s theorem gives sqf 2 2 pznq ysqf 2 l 2 ptnq apuq gpaq 2 tn qpq aq 2 f p q 2 d max apuq gpaq 2 tn qp q f p q 2 d 4 14 where qp q apuq qpq aq applying lemmas 1 and 6 to each factor gpa q ai qiq in gpaq we find that gpaq q n 2 n i 1 qi pq qiq 1 q n 2 wqpqq 1 4 15 where we have used the well known inequality pmq 1 m 1 log logm 4 16 combining 4 14 4 15 and cauchy s inequality in q we obtain qpd sqf 2 pznq q n 2 qpd wqpqq 2 2 1 2 tn qpd qp q f p q 2 d 1 2 q n 2 qpd wqpqq 2 1 2 f l 2 ptnq by our earlier observation about the

modulo q in zn i e fb qpxq fpb qxq we remark that it suffices to prove the lemma for functions fb q indeed if the inequality sqfb q 1 pznq m fb q 1 pznq holds for all restrictions fb q then also sqf 1 pznq bpzq sqfb q 1 pznq m bpzq fb q 1 pznq m f 1 pznq we now proceed to establish 4 6 for restrictions fb q note that yfb qp a qq epb a qq yfb qp q 21 from this we can deduce that sqfb qpyq hpa q y b qq q fb q pyq where q denotes the inverse fourier transform of qpq q and hpa q u qq apuq gpa q a qqep u a qq note that hpa q u qq is a multidimensional version of the sum hpa q u rq that appears in the proof of lemma 6 we now have sqfb q 1 pznq ypzn hpa q y b qq q fb q pyq we rearrange the last sum according to the residue class of ymodulo q sincehpa q y b qq depends only on the residue class of

in this section we show that the maximal function of the error term is bounded on ppznq for a range of p by comparing the averages a for p n k with the bounds for the corresponding integral operators this combined with the boundedness of the main term shows that the maximal function a is bounded on ppznq as we will see our range of p boundedness for the averages a matches that of the integral maximal function b below possibly up to endpoints for f zn c and x p zn define the integral averages by b fpxq pf qpxq 1 ty p zn fpyq u fpyq fpx yq along with their maximal function b fpxq sup pn b fpxq the operator b is equivalent to magyar stein wainger s discrete spherical maximal func tion our goal is to prove the following comparison between the integral maximal function and the waring goldbach maximal function theorem 6 suppose that 1 p 0 2 and n n 1 pkq if b and m are bounded on p 0 pznq then a is bounded on ppznq for p p 0 proof recall from the approximation formula that for each p n k we have a fpxq m fpxq e fpxq we will use the decay of the dyadic maximal function of the error term on 2 pznq by 1 5 we have sup h 2 j e f 2 pznq j k f 2 pznq 5 1 for an arbitrarily large fixed k 0 provided that the parameter c in theorem 1 is chosen sufficiently large our first order of business is to establish the following matching bound on p 0 pznq sup h 2 j e f p 0 pznq jn f p 0 pznq 5 2 for each x p zn we have a fpxq plog qnpb f qpxq thus e fpxq m fpxq plog qnpb f qpxq for each p n k and all x p zn in turn sup h 2 j e fpxq sup h 2 j m fpxq jn sup h 2 j pb f qpxq taking p 0 pznq norms and applying the hypotheses we deduce 5 2 for p 0 p 2 let be such that 1 p p 1 q p 0 2 and then choose k sufficiently large to ensure that np 1 q k 2 then interpolation between 5 1 and 5 2 reveals that sup h 2 j e f ppznq j 2 f ppznq 23 summing over j p n we find that sup p n k e f ppznq f ppznq for all p 0 p 2 combining this with our hypothesis that m is bounded on p 0 pznq and hence also on ppznq by interpolation with the trivial 8 pznq bound we are done proof of theorem 3 for k 2 the main theorem of 23 shows that b is bounded on ppznq for p n n 2 and n 5 for k 3 theorem 1 of 16 we have that b is bounded on ppznq for p maxt n n k 1 k 2 2 pn krk 2 sq k 2 1 k 2 n krk 1 s k u and n maxtkpk 2 q k 2 pk 1 qu thus the theorem is true for p 1 k 2 rk 1 s 2 n k 2 rk 1 s 2 n 2 n k 2 rk 1 s and n k 2 pk 1 q 6 applications in this section we prove theorems 2 and 4 recall that in what follows px q denotes a probability space with a commuting family of invertible measure preserving transformations t pt 1 tnq without any rational points in their spectrum for a function f x c the waring goldbach ergodic averages on x with respect to t for p n k are defined by 1 8 6 1 proof of theorem 2 fix 0 and let 0 be a parameter to be chosen later in terms of since r qn we may assume without loss of generality that 1 r q then we can choose a convergent b r to the continued fraction of 1 with r 2 1 now for a large p n k let n 1 k and q plognqc where c cp 1 q 0 is the power in the approximation formula corresponding to having 1 6 for b 1 we note that for sufficiently large there is at most one rational point a q such that 1 q q a p uq n qpq aq 0 6 1 if such a rational point does not exist the main term in 1 4 vanishes and we have x p q plog q 1 otherwise 1 4 yields x p q sp a qq d 1 pnp a qqq plog q 1 where a q satisfies 6 1 using 2 4 with 1 p 4 nq we deduce that for n 5 sp a qq q 9 201 8 q 1 q 21 20 n 2 pq q 1 q 1 2 q 9 201 d q 1 d 1 2 8 q 1 d q q 21 20 n 2 q 2 51 hence x p q q 2 51 d 1 pnp a qqq plog q 1 using the decay of d 1 see for example 10 we may now choose so that q 2 5 1 d 1 pnp a qqq unless 1 q 1 1 and 1 a 1 q 1 p nq 1 6 2 24 thus we have x p q plog q 1 unless a 1 q 1 and 1 satisfy 6 2 to complete the proof of the theorem we will show that for sufficiently large inequalities 6 2 are inconsistent with the choice of b r suppose that conditions 6 2 do hold and recall that r 1 b r 1 then bq 1 a 1 r rq 1 n q 1 r r 2 n 1 2 1 as n 8 since b r and a 1 q 1 are reduced fractions we conclude that a 1 b and q 1 r the latter however contradicts the inequalities q 1 1 r 2 remark 5 we comment that a shorter proof of theorem 2 exists by using the decay of the error term in 1 5 but this proof has the advantage of not relying on the bound 1 5 and instead uses 1 6 6 2 the pointwise ergodic theorem to prove theorem 4 we will utilize the caldero n transference principle and in doing so we need to introduce some notation let k be a large natural number and define the discrete cube cpkq m p zn mi k for i 1 n for a measurable function f x c define its truncated transfer function f px mq fptmxq 1 cpnqpmq for p n k also define the transferred averages a f px mq 1 rp q fppq logppqf px m pq and their tail maximal function a rf px mq sup r a f px mq we endow the transfer space x zn with the product measure of on x and the counting measure on zn as in 15 we deduce theorem 4 from the tail oscillation inequality below we refer to 15 for the details of this reduction which relies on the caldero n transference principle proposition 1 transferred oscillation inequality let f be a bounded function of mean zero on x and f its transfer function for each 0 there exists a sufficiently large radius r rp fq such that a rf l 2 px znq f l 2 px znq 6 3 the proof of the transferred oscillation inequality requires a few steps which we carry out in succession first we extend the approximation formula to the lifted averages for p tn define the partial zn fourier

term by ye f px q xe p q pf px q 6 5 also define their tail maximal functions similarly to a rf our estimates on the error term in theorem 1 transfer over to show that sup r e f l 2 px znq plogrq b 1 f l 2 px znq 6 6 for all large b 1 0 so that choosing r sufficiently large we may make this arbitrarily small this shows that the averages are equiconvergent with the main term lemmas 8 and 9 and a version of 4 12 for p 2 combine to give sup r q a q q m q f l 2 px znq a q a q q mq rf l 2 px znq q c 2 f l 2 px znq for some positive c 2 when n maxtn 1 pkq n 2 pkqu our final proposition completes the proof of theorem 4 this is the only place where the vanishing of the rational spectrum is used proposition 2 if 0 then there exists a radius r rpf qq p n k sufficiently large such that for all q q q a p uq and a p uq mq rf l 2 px znq f l 2 px znq 6 7 with implicit constants independent of a a q q as this is the essential part we include the proof our proof will follow that of proposi tion 9 2 in 15 for the integral k spherical maximal function unlike the integral maximal function where the localizing bump function depends on the modulus q our current local izing bump function depends on the radius so that the continuous part or the multiplier behaves like a smooth hardy littlewood averaging operator this simplifies our exposition proof by lemma 8 the tail maximal function of the
