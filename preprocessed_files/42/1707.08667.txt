improved lp boundedness for integral k spherical maximal functions discrete analysis 2018 10 18 pp www discreteanalysisjournal com improved p boundedness for integral k spherical maximal functions theresa anderson brian cook kevin hughes angel kumchev received 2 august 2017 published 29 may 2018 abstract we improve the range of p zd boundedness of the integral k spherical maximal functions introduced by magyar the previously best known bounds for the full k spherical maximal function require the dimension d to grow at least cubically with the degree k combining ideas from our prior work with recent advances in the theory of weyl sums by bourgain demeter and guth and by wooley we reduce this cubic bound to a quadratic one as an application we improve upon bounds in the authors previous work 1 on the ergodic waring goldbach problem which is the analogous problem of p zd boundedness of the k spherical maximal functions whose coordinates are restricted to prime values rather than integer values key words and phrases maximal functions integral averages surface measures fourier transforms circle method exponential sums 1 introduction our interest lies in proving p zd bounds for the integral k spherical maximal functions when k 3 these maximal functions are defined in terms of their associated averages which we now describe define a positive definite function f on rd by f x fd k x x 1 k xd k and note that when x rd f x is the diagonal form x k 1 x k d for n let r denote the number of integral solutions to the equation fd k x 1 1 when r 0 define the normalized arithmetic surface measure x 1 r 1 y zd f y x we are interested in averages given by convolution with these measures f x 1 r f y f x y c 2018 theresa c anderson brian cook kevin hughes and angel

of local densities sd k p p here p with p is related to the solubility of 1 1 over the p adic field qp and to solubility over the reals it is known that when d is sufficiently large in terms of k one has 1 sd k 1 1 3 in particular these bounds hold for d 4 k when k 4 is a power of 2 and for d 32 k otherwise see theorems 4 3 and 4 6 in vaughan 17 throughout the paper we use the notation f x g x or g x f x to mean that there exists a constant c 0 so that f x c g x for all sufficiently large x 0 the implicit constant c may depend on inessential or fixed parameters but will be independent of x below the implicit constants will often depend on the parameters k d and p for instance 1 3 means that there exists positive constants c 1 and c 2 depending on d and k so that c 1 sd k c 2 in view of 1 2 and 1 3 we may replace the convolution f above by the average a f x 1 d k f y f x y 1 4 our k spherical maximal function is then defined for x zd as the pointwise supremum of all averages a f x sup n a f x 1 5 variants of this maximal function were introduced by magyar 9 and studied later in 11 10 8 2 6 7 in particular magyar stein and wainger 11 considered the above maximal function when k 2 and d 5 and proved that it is bounded on p zd when p dd 2 this result is sharp except at the endpoint for which the restricted weak type bound was proved later by ionescu 8 to the best of our knowledge the sharpest results on the boundedness of a for degrees k 3 are those obtained by the third author in 7 in the present paper we give a further improvement for k 3 define d 0 k k 2 max 2 j k 1 k j min 2 j 2 j 2 j k j 1 1 6 further set k max 21 k k 2 k 1 and define the function 0 d k by k 0 d k d d 0 k 2 k d 0 if d 0 k d k 2 k 1 d k 2 k k if d k 2 k finally define p 0 d k max d d k 1 1 1 2 0 d k we remark that when d d 0 k p 0 d k always lies in the range 1 2 our main result is the following 2 theorem 1 if k 3 d d 0 k and p p 0 d k then the maximal operator a defined by 1 5 is bounded on p zd that is a f p zd f p zd let d 0 k 1 bd 0 k c denote the least dimension in which theorem 1 establishes that a is bounded on 2 zd we emphasize that for large k we have d 0 k k 2 k o k 1 2 whereas in previous results such as the work of the third author 6 7 one required d k 3 k 2 while our results improve on these previous results by a factor of the degree k the conjecture is that the maximal function is bounded on 2 zd for d k see 6 for details but such a result appears to be way beyond the reach of present methods it is also instructive to compare d 0 k to the known bounds for the function g k in the theory of waring s problem defined as the least value of d for which the asymptotic formula 1 2 holds it transpires that the values of d 0 k match the best known upper bounds on g k for all but a handful of small values of k and even in those cases we miss the best known bound on g k only by a dimension or two for an easier comparison we list the numerical values of d 0 k k 10 their respective analogues in earlier work and the bounds on g k in table 1 k 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 d 0 k 10 16 24 35 47 62 79 97 d 1 k 13 33 81 181 295 449 649 901 g k 8 15 23 34 47 61 78 97 table 1 comparison between the values of d 0 k in theorem 1 the corresponding values d 1 k in the work of hughes 6 and the known upper bounds on g k in bourgain 3 and vaughan 16 a key ingredient in the proof of theorem 1 and its predecessors is an approximation formula generalizing 1 2 first introduced in 11 when k 2 such approximations are obtained for the average s corresponding fourier multiplier a 1 d k f x e x 1 7 where td and e z e 2 iz we need to introduce some notation in order to state our approximation formula given an integer q 1 we write zq z qz and z q for the group of units we also write eq x e x q the d dimensional gauss sum of degree k is defined as g q a b q d x zdq eq af x b x for a zq and b zdq if denotes the surface in r d defined by 1 1 and ds x denotes the induced lebesgue measure on we define a continuous surface measure d x on by d x 1 d k ds x f x we note that d is essentially a probability measure on for all we also fix a smooth bump function which is 1 on 1 8 1 8 d and supported in 1 4 1 4 d finally we write for the rd fourier transform of a measure on rd and f for the zd fourier transform which has domain td of a function f on zd 3 theorem 2 approximation formula if k 3 d d 0 k and n is sufficiently large then one has a q 1 a z q eq a w 1 d b zd g q a wb q b d w q 1 b e where the error terms e are the multipliers of convolution operators satisfying the dyadic maximal inequality sup 2 e 2 zd 2 zd 1 8 for each 1 and all sufficiently small 0 our approximation formula takes the same shape as those in 6 and 7 but with an improved error term that relies on two recent developments the underlying analytic methods were improved in the authors previous work 1 and the recent resolution of the main conjecture about vinogradov s mean value integral 19 4 and related refinements of classical mean value estimates 18 3 the most dramatic improvement follows from our improved analytic methods originating in 1 where we improve the range of 2 zd by a factor of the degree k in 7 this sort of improvement which also used the recent resolution of the vinogradov mean values theorems 18 3 was limited to maximal functions over sufficiently sparse sequences here our bounds supersede those for integral k spherical maximal functions over sparse sequences in 7 because our treatment of the minor arcs in the error term is more efficient the reader may compare lemmas 3 2 and 3 1 below to lemmas 2 1 and 2 2 of 7 to determine the efficacy of our method here consequently 18 and 3 allow us to further improve slightly upon a more direct application of the vinogradov mean value theorems from 19 and 4 one minor drawback is that in our method the losses in 19 4 do not allow us to deduce endpoint bounds as an application we deduce that the maximal function of the ergodic waring goldbach problem introduced in our recent work 1 is bounded on the same range of spaces as above that maximal function is associated with averages where instead of sampling over integer points we sample over points where all coordinates are prime to be precise let r denote the number of prime solutions to the equation 1 1 weighted by logarithmic factors that is r f x 1 pd x log x 1 log xd where 1 pd is the indicator function of vectors x z d with all coordinates prime when r 0 define the normalized arithmetic surface measure x 1 r 1 y pd f y x log x 1 log xd and the respective convolution operators w f f 1 9 similarly to 1 2 we know that as one has the asymptotic r s d k o 1 d k 1 4 wheres d k is a product of local densities similar tosd k above moreover when d 3 k and is restricted to a particular arithmetic progression d k we have 1 s d k 1 and the above estimate turns into a true asymptotic formula for r see the introduction and references in 1 by theorem 6 of 1 and theorem 1 above we immediately obtain the following result here as in 1 d 1 3 13 and d 1 k k 2 k 3 theorem 3 if k 3 d d 1 k and p p 0 d k then the maximal function defined by w f x sup d k w f x is bounded on p zd as another application one may give analogous improvements of the ergodic theorems obtained in 6 but we do not consider this here to establish our theorems we follow the paradigm in 11 and strengthen the connection to waring s problem as initiated in 7 by using a lemma from 1 we then use recent work on waring s problem to obtain improved bounds we remark that 15 and 12 previously connected mean values hypothesis k and vinogradov s mean value theorems respectively to discrete fractional integration in section 2 we outline the proofs of theorems 1 and 2 we recall some results from 6 9 and state the key propositions required in the proofs the remaining sections establish the propositions in section 3 we deal with the minor arcs particularly in section 3 2 we use the recent work of bourgain demeter and guth 4 on vinogradov s mean value theorem and a method of wooley 18 for estimation of mean values over minor arcs in section 4 we establish the relevant major arc approximations finally in section 5 we establish the boundedness of the maximal function associated with the main term in the approximation formula 2 outline of the proof since a is trivially bounded on zd we may assume through the rest of the paper that p 2 fix n and consider the dyadic maximal operator a f sup 2 a f when we have a f 1 d k t h f e d where h h x e f x 1 n n d x with n 1 k this representation allows us to decompose a into operators of the form ab f 1 d k b h f e d 2 1 for various measurable sets b t our decomposition of a is inspired by the hardy littlewood circle method when q n and 0 a q we define the major arc m a q by m a q a q 1 4 kqnk 1 a q 1 4 kqnk 1 5 we then decompose t into sets of major and minor arcs given by m m q n a z q m a q and m t m since the major arcs m a q are disjoint this yields a respective decomposition of a as a q n a z q aa q am where aa q am a q we will use the notations ab and a b to denote the respective maximal functions obtained from the operators ab for example from 2 1 and the trivial bound for the trigonometric polynomial h f we obtain the trivial 1 bound ab 1 zd 1 zd b 2 2 in section 3 we analyze the minor arc term and prove the following result proposition 2 1 if k 3 d d 0 k and 1 then am 2 zd 2 zd 2 3 for all 0 0 d k for 1 p 2 interpolation between 2 2 and 2 3 yields am p zd p zd p with p 2 1 1 1 p 1 when p 0 d k p 2 we have p 0 and hence am p zd p zd 2 j 1 am p zd p zd 2 j 1 p 1 2 4 the estimation of the major arc terms is more challenging because an analogue of 2 3 does not hold for am still it is possible to establish a slightly weaker version of proposition 2 1 the following result was first established by magyar 9 for d 2 k and then extended by the third author 6 in the present form proposition 2 2 if k 3 d 2 k dd k p 2 and 1 one has am p zd p zd 1 2 5 this proposition suffices to establish the p boundedness of the dyadic maximal functions a this is the main result of magyar 9 but falls just short of what is needed for an equally quick proof of theorem 1 instead we use theorem 2 to approximate am by a bounded operator let m a q denote the convolution operator on p zd with fourier multiplier ma q eq a w 1 d b zd g q a wb q b d w q 1 b and define m q n a z q ma q and m sup n m in section 4 we will handle the major arc approximations and prove the following proposition 6 proposition 2 3 if k 3 d 2 k and dd k p 2 then there exists an exponent p p d k 0 such that sup 2 am m p zd p zd p 2 6 remark 2 1 theorem 2 is an immediate consequence of propositions 2 1 and 2 3 moreover since when p 2 and d 52 k inequality 2 6 holds for any 2 1 2 k see inequality 4 8 and the comments after it the error bound 1 8 holds for all with 0 min 0 d k 1 2 k when we sum 2 6 over dyadic 2 j we deduce that sup 1 am m p zd p zd 1 combining this bound and 2 4 we conclude that the p boundedness of the maximal operator a follows from the p boundedness of m the following proposition which we establish in section 5 then completes the proof of theorem 1 proposition 2 4 if k 3 d 2 k and dd k p 2 then m is bounded on p zd 3 minor arc analysis our minor arc analysis splits naturally in two steps the first step is a reduction to mean value estimates related to waring s problem for this we use a technique introduced in 1 we then apply recent work on waring s problem to estimate the relevant mean values and to prove proposition 2 1 3 1 reduction to mean value theorems the reduction step is based on the following lemma a special case of lemma 7 in 1 in the present form the result is a slight variation of lemma 4 2 in 6 and is implicit also in 11 lemma 3 1 for n let t be a convolution operator on 2 zd with fourier multiplier given by t b k e d where b t is a measurable set and k l 1 t is a kernel independent of further for 2 define the dyadic maximal functions t f x t x sup 2 t f x then t 2 zd 2 zd b sup td k d 3 1 for a measurable set b t we have a b 1 d k b fn e d 7 where fn d j 1 s n j with s n n n e n k n thus in the proof of proposition 2 1 we apply 3 1 with k fn and b m the supremum over on the right side of 3 1 then stands in the way of a direct application of known results from analytic number theory our next lemma overcomes this obstacle its proof is a variant of the argument leading to 12 in wooley 18 lemma 3 2 if k 2 l k 1 and s are natural numbers and b t a measurable set then b sup t s n 2 s d nl l 1 2 b tl n n 1 e nk ln l 1 n 2 s d d 1 3 2 proof define s n 1 n n e nk n since sup t s n 2 sup t s n 1 3 3 it suffices to establish 3 2 with s n in place of s n set h j sn j for h h 1 hl zl we define ah 1 n 1 ns n n h e fs k n where n h 1 if fs j n h j for all j 1 l 0 otherwise we have s n s h 1 h 1 hl hl ah e h 1 so by applying the cauchy schwarz inequality we deduce that sup s n 2 s h 1 hl h 1 h 1 hl hl ah 2 hence b sup s n 2 s d nl l 1 2 b h 1 h 1 hl hl ah ah d 3 4 we have h 1 h 1 hl hl ah ah 1 n m n e fs k n fs k m h 1 h 1 hl hl n h m h 8 by orthogonality h 1 h 1 hl hl n h m h h 1 h 1 hl hl m h tl e l j 1 j fs j n h j d tl e l j 1 j fs j n fs j m d since for a fixed m the sum over h has exactly one term in which h j fs j m hence h 1 h 1 hl hl ah ah tl n n 1 e nk ln l 1 n 2 s d 3 5 the lemma follows from 3 3 3 5 remark 3 1 with slight modifications the argument of lemma 3 2 yields also the following estimate b t s n 2 s d d nl l 1 2 1 b tl n n 1 e nk ln l 1 n 2 s d d 1 3 2 mean value theorems we now recall several mean value estimates from the literature on waring s problem the first is implicit in the proof of theorem 10 of bourgain 3 which is a variant of a well known lemma of hua see lemma 2 5 in 17 the present result follows from eqn 6 6 in 3 we note that when l k the left side of 3 6 turns into vinogradov s integral js k n and the lemma turns into the main result of bourgain demeter and guth 4 lemma 3 3 if k 3 2 l k and s 12 l l 1 are natural numbers then t tl 1 n n 1 e nk l 1 n l 1 1 n 2 s d d n 2 s l l 1 2 3 6 for small k we will use another variant of hua s lemma due to br dern and robert 5 the following is a weak form of lemma 5 in 5 lemma 3 4 if k 3 and 2 l k are natural numbers then t 2 n n 1 e nk n 2 l 2 d d n 2 l l 1 3 7 note that by remark 3 1 with l 1 in place of l and lemma 3 3 we obtain a version of 3 7 with l l 1 in place of 2 l 2 together with lemma 3 4 this observation yields the following bound corollary 3 1 if k 3 and 2 l k are natural numbers and r min l l 1 2 l 2 then t 2 n n 1 e nk n r d d nr l 1 3 8 9 we also use a variant of lemma 3 3 that provides extra savings when the integration over is restricted to a set of minor arcs lemma 3 5 a slight modification of theorem 1 3 in wooley 18 improves on 3 6 in the case l k 1 here m is the set of minor arcs defined at the beginning of 2 lemma 3 5 if k 3 and s 12 k k 1 are natural numbers then m tk 2 n n 1 e nk k 2 n k 2 1 n 2 s d d n 2 s k k 1 2 2 3 9 proof the main point in the proof of theorem 2 1 in wooley 18 is the inequality see p 1495 in 18 m tk 2 n n 1 e nk k 2 n k 2 1 n 2 s d d nk 2 log n 2 s 1 js k 2 n the lemma follows from this inequality and the bourgain demeter guth bound for vinogradov s integral js k 2 n the case l k of 3 6 now we interpolate between the above bounds lemma 3 6 if k 3 and 2 l k 1 are natural numbers and r is real with r 1 k l k 2 kl min l 2 l 2 l 2 k l 1 r k 2 k 3 10 then ir k n m sup t s n r d nr k r 3 11 where r is the linear function of r with values r 1 0 and k 2 k 1 proof let r 0 min l 2 l 2 l 2 the hypothesis on r implies that r 0 r k 2 k so we can find t 0 1 such that r tr 0 1 t k 2 k by lemma 3 2 with l 1 and corollary 3 1 ir 0 k n n t 2 n n 1 e nk n r 0 d d nr 0 l 3 12 on the other hand lemma 3 2 with l k 2 and lemma 3 5 yield ik k 1 k n n k 1 k 2 2 nk k 1 k k 1 2 2 nk 2 1 3 13 using h lder s inequality and the above bounds we get ir k n ik k 1 k n 1 tir 0 k n t n 1 t k 2 1 nt r 0 l n 1 t k 2 k tr 0 n 1 t k 1 tl nr k 1 t k l 1 this inequality takes the form 3 11 with r 1 t k l 1 since t depends linearly on r and t 0 when r k 2 k r is a linear function of r with k 2 k 1 the value of r 1 k l in 3 10 is the unique solution of the linear equation r 0 10 3 3 proof of proposition 2 1 by lemma 3 1 and the arithmetic geometric mean inequality sup 2 am 2 zd 2 zd nk d m sup td fn d n k did k n 3 14 where id k n is the integral defined in 3 11 thus the proposition will follow if we prove the inequality id k n n d k 3 15 with k 0 d k let l 0 k denote the value of l for which the maximum in the definition of d 0 k is attained recall 1 6 when d 0 k d k 2 k we may apply 3 11 with r d and l l 0 to deduce 3 15 with d we now observe that when d k 2 k we have d k 0 d k and that the hypothesis d d 0 k ensures that d 0 when d k 2 k we enhance our estimates with the help of the l bound for s n on the minor arcs by combining a classical result of weyl see lemma 2 4 in vaughan 17 and theorem 5 in bourgain 3 we have sup m t s n n 1 k k being the quantity that appears in the definition of 0 d k thus when d k 2 k we have id k n n d k 2 k 1 k ik k 1 k n n d k 1 d k 2 k k we conclude that 3 15 holds with 1 d k 2 k k 4 major arc analysis we will proceed through a series of successive approximations to aa q which we will define by their fourier multipliers our approximations are based on the following major arc approximation for exponential sums that appears as part of theorem 3 of br dern and robert 5 in this result and throughout the section we write g q a b q 1 x zq eq ax k bx and vn n 0 e tk t dt lemma 4 1 let t q n a z q and b z and suppose that aq 14 kqnk 1 bq 12 q then n n e nk n g q a b vn a q b q o q 1 1 k recall the definition of s n from section 3 1 when a q lies on a major arc m a q and b q with 1 2 q the above lemma yields s n a q g q a b vn g q a b vn o q 1 1 k 4 1 11 we will use this approximation in conjunction with the following well known bounds see theorems 7 1 and 7 3 in vaughan 17 g q a b q 1 k vn n 1 n n k 1 k 4 2 we will make use also of the inequality vn n 1 n 1 2 4 3 which follows from the representation vn 1 k nk 0 u 1 k 1 e u u 1 k du and the second derivative bound for oscillatory integrals see p 334 in 14 proof of proposition 2 3 the bulk of the work concerns the case p 2 of the proposition since a a q 1 d keq a m 0 q fn a q e d the asymptotic 4 1 suggests that the following multiplier should provide a good approximation to a a q b a q 1 d keq a m 0 q gn e d where gn d j 1 g q a b j vn j g q a b j vn j with b j the unique integer such that 1 2 b j q j 1 2 and j j b j q let b a q denote the operator on 2 zd with the above fourier multiplier to estimate the 2 error of approximation of aa q by ba q we use that when m 0 q 4 1 and 4 2 yield fn a q gn q 1 d k nd 1 1 nk 1 d k thus if d k 1 we have m 0 q sup td fn a q gn d r q 1 d k nd 1 d 1 nk d 1 k q 1 d k nd k 1 lemma 3 1 then yields sup 2 aa q ba q 2 zd 2 zd q 1 d k n 1 4 4 12 next we approximate ba q by the operator ca q with multiplier c a q 1 d keq a b zd q b m 0 q gn e d by the localization of the above sum has at most one term in which b matches the integer vector that appears in the definition of gn hence gn 1 b zd q b is supported on a set where 18 q j b j 1 2 for some j for such j by 4 3 vn j b j q qn 1 2 and we conclude that gn 1 b zd q b q 1 2 d k nd 1 2 1 nk 1 d k so when d k 1 lemma 3 1 gives sup 2 ba q ca q 2 zd 2 zd r q 1 2 d k nk 1 2 d 1 nk d 1 k q 1 2 d k n 1 2 4 5 in our final approximation we replace ca q by the operator da q with multiplier d a q 1 d keq a w 1 d b zd q b g q a wb j w q 1 b where wb w 1 b 1 wdbd and j r d j 1 vn j e d we remark that c a q can be expressed in a matching form with j q 1 wb replaced by the analogous integral over m 0 q thus when d k we deduce from lemma 3 1 and 4 2 that sup 2 ca q da q 2 zd 2 zd m 0 q c q d k nk d 1 nk d k q 1 n 1 d k 4 6 here m 0 q c denotes the complement of the interval m 0 q in r 13 finally we note that da q is really ma q indeed by the discussion on p 498 in stein 14 see also lemma 5 in magyar 10 we have j r rd 1 0 n d t e t e f t dtd d k 1 rd 1 0 n d t e t d t d k 1 d 4 7 since the surface measure d is supported in the cube 0 n d combining this observation and 4 4 4 6 and summing over a q we conclude that when d 2 k q n a z q sup 2 aa q ma q 2 zd 2 zd n 4 8 with min d k 2 12 0 in particular when d 52 k we have 1 2 we can now finish the proof of proposition 2 3 for brevity we write p 1 d d k from 4 8 we obtain that sup 2 am m 2 zd 2 zd n 4 9 on the other hand we know from propositions 2 2 and 2 4 that both am and m are bounded on p zd when p 1 p 2 hence sup 2 am m p zd p zd 1 4 10 when p p 0 d k 2 we interpolate between 4 9 and 4 10 with p p 1 for a sufficiently small 0 the interpolation yields 2 6 with p 0 that can be chosen arbitrarily close to 2 p p 1 kp 2 p 1 5 main term contribution in this section we prove proposition 2 4 first we obtain lp rd bounds for the maximal function of the continuous surface measures d lemma 5 1 if k 2 d 32 k and p 2 d k 2 d 2 k then for all f l p rd sup 0 f d lp rd f lp rd 5 1 proof we will deduce the lemma from a result of rubio de francia theorem a in 13 which reduces 5 1 to bounds for the fourier transform of the measure d first we majorize the measure d by a smooth one by the choice of normalization of d we have f d x rd f x y d y rd f x ty d 1 y where t 1 k let be a smooth function supported in 1 2 3 2 and such that 1 0 1 x x and write x x 1 xd since d 1 is supported inside the unit cube 0 1 d we have rd f x ty d 1 y rd f x ty y d y rd f x ty d y 14 where d is the surface measure on the smooth manifold xk 1 x k d 1 by rubio de francia s theorem the maximal function at f x sup t 0 rd f x ty d y is bounded on lp rd provided that 1 a for some a min 1 2 p 2 1 2 5 2 thus the lemma will follow if we establish 5 2 with a d k 1 and d k 1 because a 1 2 once d 32 k we now turn to 5 2 similarly to 4 7 we have r rd x e x e f x 1 dxd r d j 1 v j e d where v r x e xk x dx by the corollary on p 334 of stein 14 we have v 1 1 k 5 3 uniformly in on the other hand if k 2 k we have ddx 1 xk x 12 d jdx j 1 xk x j 1 on the support of hence proposition viii 1 on p 331 of stein 14 yields v m 1 m 5 4 for any fixed m 1 we now choose an index j 1 i d such that d i and set 0 i k 2 k we apply 5 3 to the trigonometric integrals v j j i and to v i when 0 we apply 5 4 to v i when 0 from these bounds and the integral representation for we obtain 0 1 i m 1 d 1 k d 0 d 1 d k 1 i m 1 i 1 d k 1 1 d k provided that m d k 1 and d k 1 this completes the proof proof of proposition 2 4 to prove proposition 2 4 it suffices to prove that uniformly in a and q sup n ma q p zd p zd q d k 2 2 p 15 for all dd k p 2 and d k the proposition then follows by summing over a and q the hypothesis on p ensures that the resulting series over q is convergent fix q n and a z q and write 1 2 so that 1 we borrow a trick from magyar stein and wainger 11 to express ma q as a linear combination of fourier multipliers that separate the dependence on and from the dependence on a q ma q eq a w 1 d b zd q b g q a wb d w q 1 b eq a w 1 d b zd 1 q b g q a wb b zd q b d w q 1 b eq a w 1 d s a qw t q w since w takes on precisely 2 d values for each a q it suffices to prove that sup n t q w s a q w p zd p zd q d k 2 2 p 5 5 uniformly for w 1 1 d to prove 5 5 we will first bound the maximal function over the archimedean multipliers t q w and then we will bound the non archimedean multipliers s a q w this is possible because s a qw is independent of n for d 32 k and p 2 d k 2 d 2 k lemma 5 1 and corollary 2 1 of 11 the magyar stein wainger transference principle give the bound sup n t q wg p zd g p zd 5 6 with an implicit constant independent of q and w we now observe that s a qw does not depend on and apply 5 6 with g s a qw f to find that sup n t q w s a q w p zd p zd s a qw p zd p zd 5 7 under the same assumptions on d and p which we note are weaker than the hypotheses of the proposition finally observe that g q a b is a q periodic function with zq fourier transform equal to b zq eq mb g q a b q 1 x zq eq ax k b zq eq b x m eq am k for each m zq hence we may apply proposition 2 2 in 11 and the bound 4 2 for g q a b to deduce that s a qw p zd p zd q dk 2 2 p 5 8 the desired inequality 5 5 follows immediately from 5 7 and 5 8 acknowledgments the first author was supported by nsf grant dms
