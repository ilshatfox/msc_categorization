inequality associated with the hypersurface rd 1 2 rd 1 0 0 2 for any 0 0 6 0 we prove that extremizers do not exist for this inequality and fully characterize extremizing sequences in terms of extremizers for the adjoint restriction inequality for the paraboloid 1 introduction fix d n and define ef t x ei t x 2 f d 1 it is conjectured that sup f lp ef q f p ap 2 for q p and q d 2 d p we will call p and q for which 2 holds valid there are many recent results about the class of functions f for which ef q ap f p and the related question of sequences fn such that lim efn q fn p ap we will call such an f an extremizer for e and such fn an extremizing sequence extremizers were shown to exist in the case p 2 in all dimensions by shao 8 and this was extended to all valid p q in the interior of the set of all valid p q by stovall 9 those results also prove that extremizing sequences are precompact modulo the symmetries of e which will be an important tool in this paper as for the value of ap and the extremizers themselves foschi proved that gaus sians are the unique extremizers for e for p 2 and d 1 2 conjecturing that this was the case for all dimensions 3 christ and quilodran 1 showed that this conjecture is essentially sharp by proving that gaussians are only critical points for the functional f 7 ef q f p if p 2 there are similar results known for restric tion

results from now on we will assume p q are exponents such that ap theorem 1 1 assume 0 0 6 0 1 sup f g lp ef e 0 0 g q f p p g p p 1 p 21 p ap 2 for all f g lp ef e 0 0 g q f p p g p p 1 p 21 p ap in other words e e 0 0 has no extremizers 3 if the sequence fn gn l p lp extremizes e e 0 0 then there exists a subsequence in n along which fn snf rn and gn snf wn 7 such that f extremizes e sn s written in the form of 3 with parameters t 0 x 0 that satisfy a n b 2 n 0 n 0 and c ntn 0 0 and rn p wn p 0 we prove theorem 1 1 part 1 by considering a sequence of dilates of an extremizer for e next we use uniform convexity to prove that for any extremizing sequence fn gn efn e 0 0 gn q 0 using the separation and transversality of the paraboloids we also prove that fn 0 and gn 0 and deduce theorem 1 1 part 2 finally we use the results in 9 to find symmetries sn such that snfn f in l p theorem 1 1 part 3 follows from a direct computation acknowledgements this project was suggested and overseen by betsy stovall and supported in part by nsf dms 1653264 the author would like to thank her for many helpful conversations and invaluable guidance in the writing of this paper 2 operator norm first we prove boundedness proposition 2 1 for f g lp rd ef e 0 0 g q 21 p ap f p p g p p 1 p 8 3 proof since e 0 0 g t x q e i t x 0 0 e g 0 t x q ap g p ef e 0 0 g q ef e 0 0 g q ef q e 0 0 g q ap f p g p 2 1 p ap f pp g p p 1 p 9 next we construct an extremizing sequence for e e 0 0 l p lp lq to show that 21 p ap is the sharp constant proposition 2 2 let f lp be such that ef q ap f p and let f d pf then lim 0 ef e 0 0 f q 21 p f p 21 p ap proof let f lp be such that f p 1 and ef q ap by the scaling properties of e we know that f p f p and ef q ef q for all 0 the identity e 0 0 f t x d 2 qe 2 0 f 2 t 1 x implies e 0 0 f ef q e 2 0 0 f ef q moreover e 2 0 0 f t x e it 2 0 2 0 ef t x 2 t 0 by approximating ef in c cpct and applying dominated convergence it is clear that e 2 0 0 f ef q 0 since f is an extremizer this implies that e 0 0 f ef q 2 ap proof of theorem 1 1 part 1 this follows from proposition 2 2 and proposition 2 1 3 non existence of extremizers now we use the operator norm to understand extremizing sequences we begin by proving that extremizing sequences of functions must converge weakly to zero proposition 3 1 assume that 0 0 0 then for every bounded extremizing sequence fn gn for e e 0 0 1 fn extremizes e and gn extremizes e 0 0 2 fn p gn p 0 as n 3 efn e 0 0 gn q 0 as n and 4 fn gn 0 weakly in l p 4 proof let fn gn p lp lp such that fn p p gn p p 1 p 1 for all n and lim n efn e 0 0 gn q 2 1 p ap by 9 we must have lim n efn e 0 0 gn q efn q e 0 0 gn q 1 10 lim n efn q e 0 0 gn q ap fn p gn p 1 11 and lim n ap fn p gn p 21 p ap fn p p gn p p 1 p 1 12 by 12 and the sharp ho lder inequality fn p gn p 2 1 p proving condition 2 combining this with 11 implies condition 1 and in particular efn q e 0 0 gn q 2 1 pap in light of 10 we see that efn e 0 0 gn q efn q e 0 0 gn q 0 since lq is uniformly convex 7 theorem 2 5 this proves condition 3 turning to condition 4 let s and let d be the measure on the paraboloid centered at the origin given by the pullback of lebesgue measure via the projection map r rd rd by definition ef f d and since lq s we may compute efn fnd fn 2 d in the same way let d be the measure on the translated paraboloid so that e 0 0 gn gnd gn 0 2 0 d let rd as long as 2 p isn t on the intersection of the two paraboloids there exists r 0 sufficiently small that b 2 r is disjoint from p 0 0 let rd 1 r be any smooth function supported on b 2 r since 0 2 0 0 for all r d e 0 0 gn 0 for all n so we can apply condition 3 to see that fn 2 d 0 since 2 ranges over all smooth functions supported onb r fn 0 weakly on a neighborhood of almost every point hence fn 0 weakly on all of r d and the statement for gn follows similarly this proves condition 4 proof of theorem 1 1 part 2 an extremizing pair f g is a constant extremizing se quence therefore non zero extremizers do not exist 5 4 characterization of extremizing sequences let fn gn p lp lp be an extremizing sequence for e e 0 0 such that fn p p gn p p 1 for all n by proposition 3 1 fn is an extremizing sequence for e so by 9 theorem 1 1 there exist sn s such that snfn f in l p along some subsequence where f is an extremizer for e let tn t be such that tn e e sn for all n then 21 p ap lim n efn e 0 0 gn q lim n tnefn tne 0 0 gn q lim n ef tne 0 0 gn q since ef q ap f p and tn are l q symmetries uniform convexity implies that tne 0 0 gn ef in l q from here we can deduce the behavior of sngn proposition 4 1 let f lp rd such that f p 1 and n n r d 1 if lim n 0 and lim n 0 then lim e 0 0 f e n n f q 0 conversely if f lp rd and gn l p rd are such that f p gn p 1 for all n and lim e 0 0 f e n n gn q 0 then lim n 0 and lim n 0 proof assume that lim n 0 and lim n 0 first we rearrange the expression e 0 0 f e n n f q ei t x 0 2 0 ei t x n 2 n f d q eit 2 0 0 2 0 eit 2 n n 2 n ei t x 2 f d q eit 2 0 0 2 0 1 eit 2 n 0 n 2 0 2 n 0 ei t x 2 f d q let 0 take g c cpct r d such that f g p o let r 0 be large enough that supp g b 0 r and e 0 0 g e n n g lq rd 1 e 0 0 g e n n g lq b 0 r o 6 then by minkowski s integral inequality and ho lder e 0 0 f e n n f lq rd 1 e 0 0 g e n n g lq rd 1 o e 0 0 g e n n g lq b 0 r o eit 2 0 0 2 0 1 eit 2 n 0 n 2 0 2 n 0 ei t x 2 g d lq b 0 r o g 1 sup r 1 eit 2 n 0 n 2 0 2 n 0 lq b 0 r o furthermore since d d 1 ei iei the mean value theorem implies that lim n sup r 1 eit 2 n 0 n 2 0 2 n 0 lq t x r limr d 1 q sup r t x r 1 eit 2 n 0 n 2 0 2 n 0 limr d 1 q sup t 2 n 0 n 2 0 2 n 0 limr d 1 q r 2 r n 0 n 2 0 2 n 0 0 hence lim supn e 0 0 f e n n f lq rd 1 o and taking 0 lim n e 0 0 f e n n f lq rd 1 0 conversely assume lim n 6 0 or lim n 6 0 consider the distance between the two paraboloids over the point rd hn 0 2 n 2 0 n we rearrange to find hn 2 n 0 0 2 0 n 2 n let an hn 0 we claim that for any fixed d ball r 0 lim sup n inf r dist an s hn cs r 0 13 indeed cs r lim supn 2 s n 0 by differentiating hn if this quantity is zero then lim n 0 and therefore lim n 6 0 in this case let 0 there exists an n 0 such that sup r 0 2 n 2 for all n n so cs r lim sup n inf r hn lim sup n n 0 7 since lim supn n 0 0 in the case we re considering we can take small enough to show that cs r 0 proving 13 we would like to construct a function c cpct r d 1 such that after passing to a subsequence in n 1 fd 1 2 and 2 limn sup b 0 r n 2 n 0 let c cpct r be a non negative bump function with supp b 0 1 and b 0 1 2 1 also let c cpct r d be such that p 1 and f 3 4 and take r 0 so that supp b 0 r note that since the zero set of h is a d 1 hyperplane dist an s b 0 r cd 1 r d 1 s where cd 1 is a dimensional constant therefore there exists an s 0 0 such that 1 dist an 2 s 0 p 1 4 and hence f 1 dist an 2 s 0 1 2 for all n now let n 3 0 0 2 cs 0 r 1 dist an 2 s 0 by 13 n n 2 n 0 for all b 0 r in addition fd n 1 2 by construction since the space of all d 1 planes intersecting the d ballb 0 r 10 s 0 is com pact either an b 0 r 10 s 0 for sufficiently large n or there exists a hyper plane a such that for a subsequence an a in the sense that lim n sup a b 0 r 10 s 0 an b 0 r 10 s 0 0 in the first case let 3 0 0 2 cs 0 r and in the second pass to the subsequence mentioned above and let 3 0 0 2 cs 0 r 1 dist a 2 s 0 8 in either case we see that n in c cpct condition 1 holds since fd s rd 1 and hence fd n fd condition 2 holds by the triangle inequality and the fact that it s satisfied for each n individually by plancherel and condition 1 e 0 0 f 1 2 on the other hand by condi tion 2 limn e n n gn 0 thus lim n e 0 0 f e n n gn q 1 2 q 6 0 which is a contradiction and proves the proposition proof of theorem 1 1 part 3 by proposition 3 1 efn q e 0 0 gn q ap and efn e 0 0 gn q 2 ap so uniform convexity implies that efn e 0 0 gn q 0 let c cpct r d set l sup supp 0 2 0 2 and let c cpct r be such that b 0 2 l 1 now let 2 by construction of lim n fn gn l 2 rd lim n fnd gnd l 2 rd 1 lim n efn e 0 0 gn lim n efn e 0 0 gn q q 0 which proves that fn gn 0 indeed since fn p gn p 0 by proposition 3 1 uniform convexity implies that the convergence is strong fn gn p 0 since fn is an extremizing sequence by 9 theorem 1 1 there exists a subsequence in n sn s and an extremizer f lp such that snfn f so we have f sngn p 0 along this subsequence as well i e 7 holds recall that the symmetries tne 0 0 gn can be expressed in the form of 6 as e 2 n 0 2 0 n 1 n 0 d pn e i tn xn n n 0 2 0 n n gn n n t x e 2 n 0 2 0 n 1 n 0 eitn 2 n 0 2 0 n 0 2 0 sngn t x 14 for n r tn xn r r d and n r d proposition 4 1 immediately implies that 2 n 0 2 0 n 1 n 0 0 which also implies n and 2 n 0 n 0 since we assumed 0 0 6 0 since sngn f in l p by the triangle inequality and the forward part of proposition 4 1 ef e eitn 2 n 0 2 0 n 0 2 0 f t x q 0 9 as well since r 2 z is compact we may pass to a subsequence along which lim tn 2 0 n 0 2 0 2 z exists by rearranging applying the boundedness of e and invoking dominated convergence eei f t x 2 ntn 0 e eitn 2 n 0 2 0 n 0 2 0 f q 0 the two preceding limits imply that eei f t x 2 ntn 0 ef q 0 hence the sequence ntn must be bounded and there exists a subsequence along which c lim ntn exists since n lim tn 0 as translation is continuous in lq ef eei f t x 2 c 0 q 0 from this is is clear that c 0 as ef t x ef t x 2 c 0 would imply that ef 0 since ef lq we now also see that ei 1 by strict convexity this proves the claim references 1 m christ and r quilodra n
