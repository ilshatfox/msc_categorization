endpoint lebesgue space bounds for convolution and restricted x ray transforms along curves satisfying fairly minimal differentia bility hypotheses with affine and euclidean arclengths we also explore the behavior of certain natural interpolants and extrapolants of the affine and euclidean versions of these operators 1 introduction this article deals with the basic problem of determining the precise amount of lp improving for certain weighted averaging operators associated to curves in rd in the unweighted case this problem has been studied by tao and wright in wide generality and in 22 they completely describe except for boundary points the set of p q for which these operators map lp boundedly into lq under certain smoothness hypotheses and in the presence of a cutoff this set of p q depends on the torsion and appropriate generalizations thereof but if instead the average is taken against an affine arclength measure the effects of vanishing torsion are mitigated and the p q region is larger in fact excepting boundary points the new region is essentially independent of the curves 20 we are interested in the questions of whether the endpoint estimates hold whether there is a natural way to relate the weighted and unweighted versions of these operators and to what extent the regularity hypotheses in previous articles often c can be relaxed endpoint bounds have been established in a number of special cases a more extensive list of references is given in 5 7 we will focus here on the most recent results in 12 gressman proved that in the polynomial case of the tao wright theorem endpoint restricted weak type estimates hold but left open the question of strong type bounds in the translation invariant case more tools are available and correspondingly more is known in 5 13 19 endpoint strong type estimates for convolution with affine arclength measure on polynomial curves were proved these estimates depend only on the dimension and polynomial degree and require no cutoff function in 7 an analogous result was proved for the restricted x ray transform for the low regularity case much less is known we are primarily motivated by the recent 14 and 6 in 14 oberlin proved bounds along the sharp line for con volution with affine arclength measure along low dimensional simple curves satis fying certain monotonicity and log concavity hypotheses in particular there exist infinitely flat curves satisfying these hypotheses this provides further motivation for the consideration of affine arclength measure because in these cases there are simply no nontrivial estimates for the unweighted operators in 6 the first author 1 http arxiv org abs 1710 07675 v 1 2 spyridon dendrinos and betsy stovall and mu ller proved that restriction to certain cd perturbations of monomial curves with affine arclength measure satisfies the same range of lp lq inequalities as restriction to nondegenerate curves our purpose here is to generalize to the extent possible the endpoint results mentioned above to more general classes of curves of low regularity to address the question of the natural relationship between the weighted and unweighted op erators we show how by a simple interpolation argument weaker estimates for operators with larger weights including the optimal estimates in the unweighted case can be deduced from the optimal estimates for the affine arclength case fi nally motivated by similarities between restriction operators and generalized radon transforms we prove an analogue of the main result of 6 for convolution with affine arclength measure along monomial like curves with only d derivatives 2 results and methods let i r be an interval and cdloc i r d that is i rd is a curve in cd k for every compact sub interval k i we define the torsion l and affine arclength measure dt by l det d l 2 d d 1 since dt is naturally interpreted as a measure on the image of the behavior of affine arclength measure under affine transformations of especially in contrast to euclidean arclength measure make it particularly well suited to harmonic analysis we are primarily interested in the convolution operator t f x i f x t t dt x r d and the x ray transform xf x y r f s x sy ds x y rd d the latter averages f along each line parallel to 1 y and we restrict y to lie along the image of x t x x x t it is known that aside from the trivial case l 0 the natural endpoint l p lq bounds for these operators are t f lqd rd f lpd rd pd qd d 1 2 d d 1 2 d 1 2 1 x f lsd r 1 d dx dt f lrd r 1 d rd sd d 1 d 2 d 2 d 2 d 2 d 2 2 and the interest is in obtaining these bounds with implicit constants that are uni form over some large class of curves such estimates have been established for polynomial curves of bounded degree 5 7 13 19 our primary goal is to relax that regularity assumption to the extent possible it is clear however that some further restrictions must be made indeed simple examples show that for 2 1 or 2 2 to hold we must have i t dt ch i 2 d d 1 for all intervals i i 2 3 uniform bounds for averages along degenerate curves 3 where ch indicates the convex hull for sufficiently small intervals i and finite type curves both sides of this inequality are comparable as discussed in 15 but without these hypotheses on the interval and curve this may fail consider the examples 1 t t sin t k exp t 2 0 t 1 2 t 1 exp t cos t 1 exp t sin t t 0 3 t t sin t cos t t r where k is taken to be sufficiently large in the case of 1 this first example is due to sjo lin 16 even though each j is an injective immersion and 2 and 3 have nonvanishing torsion none of these satisfy 2 3 globally 2 1 log concave torsions the examples 2 and 3 show that it is necessary to control the oscillation of lower dimensional projections of and not just l we define lj l 1 j and bk l l d k 1 k ld k k 1 1 k d here we are using the convention that l 0 l 1 1 so for example b d l our most general results are restricted weak type analogues of 2 1 and 2 2 which we prove in section 3 for simplicity we summarize these in somewhat less than their full generality the more general hypotheses in section 3 will be analogous to those in 14 we say that a function f i 0 is log concave if f t 1 1 t 2 f t 1 f t 2 1 theorem 2 1 let cdloc i r d assume that the bk are log concave for 1 k d then we have the restricted weak type estimates t e f cd e 1 pd f 1 q d pd qd d 1 2 d d 1 2 d 1 2 4 t 1 sd x g h cd g 1 rd h 1 s d rd sd d 1 d 2 d 2 d 2 d 2 d 2 5 for all positive measure borel sets e f rd g h r 1 d because t f y t f x this implies that t is also of restricted weak type q d p d so t is of strong type p q for all interpolants of pd qd and q d p d the proof consists of two parts in section 3 we prove propositions 3 1 and 3 2 which roughly state that if l b d is log concave and the geometric inequality det t 1 td c d j 1 l tj 1 d i j ti tj t 1 td i d 2 6 holds then the restricted weak type estimates 2 4 and 2 5 hold with constants depending on d and c we note that the left hand side of 2 6 is the jacobian of d j 1 tj so this may be thought of as a stronger more quantitative version of 2 3 for the proof of the restricted weak type estimates we use the method of re finements but with a twist in the case of proposition 3 1 by ordering certain parameters this idea was suggested by phil gressman personal communication we avoid the complicated band structure argument of 2 4 spyridon dendrinos and betsy stovall the other half of the argument is the proof of the geometric inequality the following is a simplified but weaker version of proposition 3 5 which is proved in section 6 proposition 2 2 let cdloc i r d if bk is log concave for each 1 k d 1 we may decompose i cd j 1 ij where each ij is an interval and t 1 td i d j implies that 2 6 holds with a constant depending only on d we note that in two dimensions if c 3 1 6 0 and l 6 0 we may reparametrize so that b 1 1 and hence 2 6 holds for the reparametrization in higher dimensions it seems harder to determine whether a given curve has a parametrization that satisfies the geometric inequality as an example consider the monomial curve t ta 1 tad with ai r a 1 ad then bk cat ad k 1 ad kad k k k 1 2 we interpret a 0 as 0 which is log concave if and only if the exponent is nonneg ative in particular the hypothesis of theorem 2 1 holds for a reparametrization of by either t 7 tn or t 7 t n for some large n in this way we obtain endpoint restricted weak type estimates that are completely independent of the ai by contrast the geometric inequality 2 6 is not parametrization invariant by considering simple configurations take one ti very small and the others moderate we see that log concavity of b 1 is actually necessary for the geometric inequality to hold in two dimensions this is both necessary and sufficient by proposition 2 2 in higher dimensions it is clear that further inequalities relating the exponents should be necessary but it is possible that a slightly weaker condition than log concavity of the bk suffices in the monomial case we mention this in part because it seems to be suggested in 11 though no argument is given in the case of non integer powers that a geometric inequality essentially of the form 2 6 holds for monomial curves with sufficiently large but otherwise arbitrary real powers this is not the case there is a close connection between generalized radon transforms and fourier restriction operators and it would be interesting to see whether improved restriction estimates could be obtained for curves satisfying the hypotheses of theorem 2 1 in the case of simple curves t t td 1 t such estimates were obtained in 1 in the general case proposition 2 2 and its proof may be useful but current technology for fourier restriction estimates requires additional geometric inequali ties see 6 8 9 2 2 interpolation in section 4 we give a simple interpolation argument that can be used in conjunction with the restricted weak type results of section 3 in the special case l t t k for some real number k 6 d 2 d 2 these give fractional integral analogues of 2 4 in particular when k 0 we can recover the unweighted endpoint restricted weak type estimates and hence strong type bounds on the interior of a line segment for the convolution operator we will obtain the corresponding strong type bounds in section 5 but as will be seen interpolation yields a simpler argument and gives better bounds in the interior in more general cases some of the operators and estimates that arise in this way seem a little surprising or did to the authors uniform bounds for averages along degenerate curves 5 2 3 strong type bounds in section 5 we turn our attention to the endpoint strong type bounds for the convolution operator t and related operators with different weights we are not yet able to address these at the same level of generality as in theorem 2 1 so in the spirit of 6 9 we consider the following family of monomial like curves which contains all curves of finite type let a 1 a 2 ad be nonzero but possibly negative real numbers and consider the monomial like curve t ta 1 1 t t ad d t 0 t t here i c d loc 0 t and satisfies lim t 0 i t i 0 r 0 lim t 0 tm m i t 0 1 i m d 2 7 we prove the following partial analogue of the main theorem in 6 theorem 2 3 for each monomial like curve as above there exists 0 such that for each 0 1 the operator t f x 0 f x t t dt t 1 satisfies t f lqd rd f lpd rd pd qd d 1 2 d d 1 2 d 1 2 8 for all compactly supported borel functions f if 1 the implicit constant in 2 8 may be chosen to depend only on d and an upper bound for a 1 ad ad a 1 and if 0 1 the implicit constant may be taken to depend on d a 1 ad and ad a 1 since the operator t is essentially self adjoint it follows that 2 8 also holds with pd qd replaced by the dual pair qd pd with the same bounds so it also holds for all interpolants of these pairs we note that the limiting operator as 0 is the one sided and hence very unbounded hilbert transform there is a related result in 11 but we obtain strong type rather than restricted weak type bounds up to the natural affine arclength rather than unweighted endpoint for a larger class of curves it should be possible to obtain an analogous theorem for the restricted x ray transform via similar techniques but the authors have not undertaken to verify this for the proof motivated by 6 we use the exponential parametrization t 7 e t this also avoids the issues discussed above about the rate of increase of the ai and geometric inequalities curiously in this parametrization the standard geometric inequality 2 6 is insufficient to obtain strong type bounds via our methods so in section 6 we establish an exponential improvement proposition 5 1 we prove theorem 2 3 in section 5 using the method of refinements again we order certain parameters to avoid the band structure argument though the ordering is a bit more difficult for the strong type bounds than restricted weak type bounds it still results in a substantially shorter argument than appeared in related articles cf 18 19 a potentially interesting line of further questioning would be the precise de pendence of the implicit constant in 2 8 on the ai if a ai 0 applying theorem 2 3 to a reparametrization by t 7 t 1 ad a 1 implies that 2 8 actually 6 spyridon dendrinos and betsy stovall holds with implicit constant equal to cd ad a 1 1 this seems to be essentially optimal because it scales in the right way under reparametrizations t 7 tk if a 6 0 applying the methods of section 3 to the exponential parametrization we see that the restricted weak type version of 2 8 holds with a constant depending only on d in the case 1 using this and applying the interpolation in section 3 to the reparametrization by t 7 t 1 a the restricted weak type version of 2 8 holds with implicit constant cd a 1 which again seems essentially optimal in the case of strong type bounds however the authors have not been able to remove the dependence on a ad a 1 or to show that it is necessary even in the very simple case n t t n tn 1 1 this sequence of examples is closely related to the curve t e 1 t te 1 t for which the authors have not been able to prove or disprove strong type bounds it would be somewhat surprising if endpoint strong type bounds do not hold for the latter curve because unlike all known counter examples it displays no oscillatory behavior acknowledgements the first author was supported by deutsche forschungsge meinschaft grant de 1517 2 1 the second author was partially supported by nsf dms 0902667 and 1266336 notation if a and b are two nonnegative quantities we will write a b if a cb for some innocuous constant c which will be allowed to change from line to line the meaning of innocuous will be allowed to change from proof to proof but will always be clear from the context or explicitly given by a b we mean a b a 3 restricted weak type bounds we now state our restricted weak type results in their full generality we are interested in curves for which the torsion and jacobian determinant j of t 1 td d j 1 1 j tj are related by the geometric inequality j t 1 td c d j 1 l tj 1 d 1 i j d tj ti 3 1 our main results are conditioned on the validity of this geometric inequality to gether with a log concavity assumption on proposition 3 1 let i be an open interval and i rd a d times continuously differentiable curve assume that l satisfies the geometric inequality 3 1 on i d assume further that t f t for some log concave function f on i then for all borel sets e f rd having finite measures t e f e 1 pd f 1 q d pd q d d 1 2 d d 1 d 2 d 2 3 2 the implicit constant in 3 2 depends only on d the constant c in 3 1 and the implicit constants bounding in terms of f 1 we would like to point out that the ratio a ad a 1 is invariant under the above power type reparametrizations we also note that this dependence does not seem to simply be an artifact of the exponential parametrization and also seems to arise when one uses the methods of previous articles on the subject such as 5 13 19 uniform bounds for averages along degenerate curves 7 proposition 3 2 suppose i rd satisfies the same hypotheses as in propo sition 3 1 then for all finite measure borel sets e f r 1 d t 1 qd x e f e 1 pd f 1 q d pd q d d 1 d 2 d 2 d 2 d 2 2 3 3 the implicit constant in 3 3 has the same dependence as that in 3 2 this raises the question of when the geometric inequality 3 1 holds it is known in the case when is a polynomial 8 when is monomial like 6 and for simple curves i e those of the form t td 1 d t satisfying certain monotonicity and almost log concavity hypotheses 1 14 we will show that it holds for much more general curves under hypotheses analogous to the latter case to state our result we need a couple of definitions definition 3 3 given a positive constant c we call a non negative function f i r r c almost increasing if f t 1 cf t 2 whenever t 1 t 2 we define c almost decreasing analogously and also say that a function is c almost monotone if it is either c almost increasing or c almost decreasing following oberlin 14 we also make the following definition definition 3 4 given a positive constant m we call a function f r r m almost log concave if m f t 1 t 2 2 f t 1 1 2 f t 2 1 2 for all t 1 t 2 i the following proposition which will be used in the proof of propositions 3 1 and 3 2 will be proved in section 6 such geometric inequalities have been key ingredients in most of the recent proofs of endpoint estimates 7 14 19 because a good lower bound for the jacobian of the mapping which arises from an iteration procedure is a central feature of the method of refinements which originated in christ 2 these geometric inequalities were first proved in the context of fourier restriction to curves see 6 8 9 the curves considered here are direct gener alizations of the curves considered by oberlin 14 however our proof resembles more the one in 6 proposition 3 5 let i be an open interval and i rd a d times continuously differentiable curve assume that the lj 1 j d never vanish on i and that the functions l l d k 1 k ld k k 1 1 k d 1 are c almost monotone and m almost log concave for some c m 0 then for all t 1 td i d j t 1 td d j 1 l tj 1 d 1 i j d tj ti 3 4 the implicit constants in 3 4 only depend on c m and d the hypotheses on the functions l l d k 1 k ld k k 1 1 k d 1 are a direct generalization of the conditions in 1 14 for simple curves of the form t t 2 td 1 t for these curves all the lk 1 k d 1 are identically constant and l is a constant multiple of d in that case our hypotheses amount 8 spyridon dendrinos and betsy stovall to a condition on the d th derivative of not any lower derivatives so they are slightly weaker than the hypotheses in 1 14 for non simple curves easy examples in low dimensions such as t cos t sin t and t cos t sin t t show that conditions only on l are not sufficient one can check that for i r the geometric inequality 3 4 fails and the corresponding convolution and restricted x ray transforms are unbounded we devote the bulk of this section to the proof of proposition 3 1 and we will indicate what changes need to be made in order to prove proposition 3 2 at the end of the section proof of proposition 3 1 by standard approximation arguments we may assume that i is a compact interval and that cd i rd since f is log concave we may split i into two open intervals il and ir such that f is increasing on il and decreasing on ir we can reparametrize t 7 t on ir and therefore without loss of generality we assume that f is increasing on i since the restricted weak type inequality is trivial on any interval on which is identically zero and since f is increasing we may assume that is nonvanishing on i thus we may assume that f c 1 finally by a reparametrization we may assume that i 0 1 these assumptions will remain in force for the remainder of the argument the following will be helpful later on lemma 3 6 for 0 1 0 t dt define h to be the unique element of i satisfying h 0 t dt then for all 0 a b 1 0 t dt and 0 1 h 1 a b 1 h a h b 3 5 proof of lemma 3 6 we compute f h f h h f h h f h f h log f h 3 6 since 0 h is strictly increasing and log f is concave log f h is decreasing therefore by 3 6 f h is concave and since f 3 5 follows define quantities t e f f t e f e by simple arithmetic 3 2 is equivalent to f d d 2 d 2 3 7 the key step in the proof is the next lemma lemma 3 7 if d is even there exist x 0 f and a borel set i d with the following properties d i 1 ti dt d 2 d 2 uniform bounds for averages along degenerate curves 9 if t 1 td then 0 t 1 t 2 td 1 and furthermore x 0 d i 1 1 i ti f 3 8 t 1 0 t dt max ti ti 1 t dt if i 1 is odd if i is even 3 9 if d is odd there exist a point y 0 e and a borel set i d satisfying d i 1 ti dt d 1 2 d 1 2 and moreover if t 1 td then 0 t 1 t 2 td 1 and y 0 d i 1 1 i ti f t 1 0 t dt max ti ti 1 t dt if i 1 is odd if i is even before proving the lemma we show how to complete the proof of the proposition this portion of the argument is much simpler than previous arguments such as 2 because the ordering of the ti means that we can avoid the band structure argument that the ti might be ordered was suggested to the second author by phil gressman we assume for now that the dimension d is even the completion of the proof in the odd dimensional case is similar and will be left to the reader recall that we may assume that l is never zero on i this plus the ordering implies that is one to one on see 9 section 3 from 3 8 this injectivity and the geometric inequality we have f d i 1 l ti 1 d i j ti tj dt 3 10 let t 1 td let i 1 be odd by 3 9 there exists an si with ti 1 si ti such that si ti 1 t dt by 3 9 and the fact that ti 1 t 1 this implies that si 0 t dt ti 1 0 t dt for some 1 thus by lemma 3 6 si f si f ti 1 ti 1 h ti 1 0 t dt h si 0 t dt si therefore ti ti 1 si ti 1 si 1 2 ti 1 1 2 si ti 1 t dt 10 spyridon dendrinos and betsy stovall ti 1 1 2 si 1 2 ti 1 1 2 ti 1 2 similar arguments show that if i is even ti ti 1 ti 1 1 2 ti 1 2 and if 1 i j 2 d 2 then tj ti tj 1 2 ti 1 2 thus if t 1 td 1 i j d tj ti d d 1 2 d 2 d 2 d i 1 ti d 1 2 so by 3 10 and some arithmetic recall that l 2 d d 1 f d d 1 2 d 2 d 2 d i 1 ti dt d d 1 2 d which is just 3 7 therefore all that is needed to establish proposition 3 1 is to prove lemma 3 7 proof of lemma 3 7 let u x t f i x t e then t e f u x t t dt dx 3 11 define projections 1 u e and 2 u f by 1 x t x t 2 x t x this means that u 11 e 1 2 f we will make several refinements to u define b 0 x t u 0 t h 1 4 b 0 x t u 0 t h 1 4 then by fubini and the change of variables formula b 0 x t t dt dx f x

that the ti are ordered by removing points x t for which t is too large to this end let u 1 u 0 b 1 and define b 1 x t u 1 1 t u 1 x t s s s ds 1 16 if y 1 u 1 u 1 y s s s ds u 0 y s s s ds 1 8 and b

is a set a x t t 1 such that a x t s ds 1 16 and s a x t x t s s u 0 it is the fact that a x t t 1 that will allow us to ensure that the ti are increasing when we form the set d to continue this process we define b 2 x t u 1 1 0 u 1 x s s ds 1 32 u 2 u 1 b 2 b 2 x t u 2 1 t u 2 x s s ds 1 64 u 2 u 2 b 2 arguing as above u 2 x t t dt dx 1 64 u x t t dt dx 12 spyridon dendrinos and betsy stovall we iterate assume that the set uk u satisfying uk x t t dt dx 1 4 k 1 u x t t dt dx has been constructed if k is even we define bk 1 x t uk 1 0 uk x t s s s ds 1 4 k 3 2 u k 1 uk bk 1 b k 1 x t u k 1 1 t u k 1 x t s s s ds 1 4 k 2 uk 1 u k 1 b k 1 so if x t uk 1 1 t uk x t s s s ds 1 4 k 2 k even if k is odd we define bk 1 x t uk 1 0 uk x s s ds 1 4 k 3 2 u k 1 uk bk 1 b k 1 x t u k 1 1 t u k 1 x s s ds 1 4 k 2 uk 1 u k 1 b k 1 so if x t uk 1 1 t uk x s s ds 1 4 k 2 k odd similar arguments to those for k 1 2 show that uk x t t dt dx 1 4 k 1 u x t t dt dx for all k in particular ud is nonempty if the sets e and f are borel then u is borel as are each of the refinements uk so measurability is not an issue at this point the arguments when d is even and d is odd diverge we give the details when d is even the proof when d is odd is essentially the same let x 0 t 0 ud we will construct a sequence of sets 1 i k k 1 i 2 i d d will be the set whose existence was claimed in lemma 3 7 we construct the k inductively let t 1 tk k and define xk tk x 0 k 1 j 1 1 j tj tk k odd x 0 k j 1 1 j tj tk k even the k will be defined so that xk tk ud k 0 k d in particular x 0 f and if t 1 td d

the proof of lemma 3 7 the proof of proposition 3 1 is also now complete we now turn to the restricted x ray transform in establishing bounds for x via the method of refinements the maps that arise

inequalities proposition 3 8 let i rd be a cd curve satisfying the geometric inequality 3 1 on id 14 spyridon dendrinos and betsy stovall i if d 1 2 d is an even integer s 0 s 1 sd r d 1 and t 0 t 1

possible convenience of the reader we also need an almost injectivity result for the maps in 3 15 3 16 it will be easier to state if we abuse notation and write d 1 s 0 x 0 t 1 s 1 d 1 s 0 x 0 t s d 1

propositions 3 8 and 3 9 in section 6 assuming their validity for now we outline the changes that must be made to the proof of proposition 3 1 in order to establish proposition 3 2 by a simple arithmetic argument the key step in the proof by refinements is the following lemma 3 10 if d 1 2 d 4 is even then there exist a point t 0 y 0 f and a borel set rd 1 such that d i 0 ti dtd dsd dt 1 ds 1 d d uniform bounds for averages along degenerate curves 15 and such that if s 1 t 1 sd td then 0 t 0 t 1 td 1 s 1 sd and for 2 i d d 1 t 0 y 0 f ti 1 si si 1 t 0 0 t dt t 1 t 0 t dt ti ti 1 t dt if d 1 2 d 1 3 is odd then there exist a point s 0 x 0 f and a borel set rd 1 such that d 1 i 1 ti dtd 1 dsd dtd ds 1 dt 1 d d 1 and such that if t 1 s 1 td sd td 1 then 0 t 1 t 2 td 1 1 s 0 sd and for 2 i d d 1 s 0 x 0 f t 1 s 1 s 0 ti si si 1 t 1 0 t dt ti ti 1 t dt sketch of proof lemma 3 10 may be proved similarly to lemma 3 7 but with some adjustments define u s t y r i rd s y s t e t y f then x e f u t ds dt dy we define b 0 s t y u t h 1 2 u 0 u b 0 it is easy to check that u 0 t ds dt dy 1 2 u t ds dt dy we will again iteratively construct a sequence of sets u 0 u 1 u 2 assume that uk satisfying uk t ds dt dy 1 4 k 1 u t ds dt dy is given we define bad sets to be excised if k is even these are bk 1 s t y uk 1 0 uk s y s t s d 1 22 k 3 b k 1 s t y uk bk 1 1 t uk s y s t s d 1 22 k 4 if k is odd we define bk 1 s t y uk 1 0 uk t y t d 1 22 k 3 b k 1 s t y uk bk 1 1 s uk t y t d 1 22 k 3 in either case the next set is uk 1 uk bk 1 b k 1 it may be veri fied as in the proof of lemma 3 7 that uk 1 satisfies the inductive hypothesis uk 1 t ds dt dy 1 4 k 2 u t ds dt dy we leave the remaining details to the reader 16 spyridon dendrinos and betsy stovall the rest of the proof of proposition 3 2 uses lemma 3 6 and the same argument as the proof of proposition 3 1 4 a simple interpolation argument in this section we show how restricted weak type endpoint bounds for differently weighted operators may be deduced from the restricted weak type endpoint bounds operators with affine arclength measure we work with restricted weak type esti mates somewhat related arguments may be found in 10 17 the general form of our result follows proposition 4 1 let i be an interval and let cdloc i r d and assume that t i l t 0 has measure 0 if t e f c e 1 pd f 1 1 qd for borel sets e f rd then t e f c e pd f 1 qd 0 1 where t f x i f x t t 1 t dt 4 1 and t t t 0 s ds for some arbitrary t 0 i the proof is elementary proof we may assume that t 0 0 i 0 since 4 1 is completely parametrization invariant we reparametrize by 1 so 1 thus t f x i f x t dt t 1 let in i 2 n 2 n 1 and tnf x in f x t dt then t e f 2 n 2 n 1 tn e f 2 n min c 2 n 1 e 1 pd f 1 1 qd 2 n f c e pd f 1 qd a similar result can easily be deduced for the restricted x ray transform this raises the question of what the natural interpolants would be in the general trans lation non invariant case considered in 20 22 and whether it is possible to obtain the unweighted estimates from the weighted ones using a similarly simple interpo lation argument examples let t ta 1 1 t t ad d t be a monomial like curve as de scribed in 2 3 of the introduction and let a i ai it is proved in 6 cf proposition 5 1 in this article that there exists r such that the exponential parametrization t e t e a 1 t 1 t e adt d t uniform bounds for averages along degenerate curves 17 satisfies the following for all t and t 1 td d l t c a e at c a d i 1 ai i 0 i j aj ai j t 1 td d j 1 l tj 1 d i j tj ti with implicit constants depending only on d by proposition 3 1 we obtain end point restricted weak type estimates with implicit constants depending only on d by the above interpolation argument we therefore obtain restricted weak type endpoint bounds for t f x e 0 f x t t a t 1 dt if a 6 0 t f x e 0 f x t t t log t 1 dt if a 0 with constants depending only on d we will give strong type endpoint bounds for these operators in the next section but those obtained by interpolation are more uniform in the case a 6 0 they are actually weaker in the case a 0 in the special case a d 2 d 2 d 2 d 2 a we recover the restricted weak type endpoint bounds for the unweighted operator in the case of monomial curves with positive integer powers the estimates below the unweighted endpoint were already seen in 11 with an additional dependence on the degree let t e 1 t te 1 t for sufficiently small satisfies the hypotheses of proposition 3 1 on 0 so the restricted weak type estimate 3 2 holds we compute t f x 0 f x t t 2 3 2 e 2 3 t dt for f 0 and by the proposition we can bound this for 0 1 reparametriz ing s s log s 1 1 s and t f x e 1 0 f x s log s 1 2 3 s 2 3 1 ds this parametrization is somewhat more natural from a geometric viewpoint since 0 6 0 now we consider the opposite extreme the curve t t e 1 t is infinitely flat at 0 and may be viewed as a limiting case for the sequence of curves t tn for f 0 we estimate t f x 0 f x t t 2 3 2 e t dt by propositions 3 1 and 3 5 t 1 does satisfy the restricted weak type estimate 3 2 for sufficiently small by the proposition we can bound t for all 0 1 in the limiting case 0 p q and q p 1 for certain curves the limiting operator is the one sided and hence ill defined hilbert transform but it seems interesting that other even more singular integrals arise in this way 18 spyridon dendrinos and betsy stovall 5 strong type bounds we now turn to the proof of theorem 2 3 recall that t ta 1 1 t tad d t 0 t t for nonzero but possibly negative real numbers a 1 ad and i c d loc 0 t satisfying lim t 0 i t i 0 r 0 lim t 0 tm m i t 0 1 i m d we use the exponential parametrization from 6 set t e t i t i e t i i 0 changing variables and setting log t f x f x t t dt 5 1 our main tool in bounding this operator will be the following geometric inequality proposition 5 1 there exists a constant cd 0 such that for each as above there exists r such that l t e t d j 1 ai d j 1 aj j 1 i j d aj ai 5 2 on and such that for all t 1 td d j t 1 td d i 1 l ti 1 d 1 i j d ti tj e cd ad a 1 ti tj 5 3 the implicit constants in 5 2 and 5 3 depend only on d this represents a small improvement over the corresponding lower bound in 6 because of the presence of the exponential term on the far right of 5 3 though slight this extra growth will be essential for our argument we will prove this proposition in section 6 now we concentrate on the proof of theorem 2 3 to which we devote the remainder of the section by rescaling t in 5 1 and using the parametrization invariance we may assume that d i 1 ai a d d 1 2 0 d d 1 2 and that if a 0 ad a 1 1 this assumption will remain in force for the remainder of the section the quantity a ad a 1 is invariant under rescaling so our goal is now to prove 2 8 with implicit constants depending on d and an upper bound for ad a 1 1 for j 1 z and 0 1 we define t j f x j 1 j f x t t dt with the natural modification which we will gloss over when j j 1 using an extended method of refinements in the spirit of 3 we will show at the end of this section that theorem 2 3 follows from the next two lemmas lemma 5 2 let e 1 e 2 f r d be borel sets and let j 1 j 2 be integers for i 1 2 let 1 t 1 j 1 ei f e 1 and assume that t 1 ji ei x i for x f then e 2 e cd ad a 1 j 1 j 2 d 1 2 2 1 d 1 1 d 1 2 2 5 4 uniform bounds for averages along degenerate curves 19 where c 1 d min 1 ad a 1 a and we interpret ad a 1 0 to be the implicit constant may be taken to depend only on d lemma 5 3 let e f 1 f 2 r d be borel sets and let j 1 j 2 be integers for i 1 2 let i t 1 ji e fi fi and assume that t 1 ji fi y i for y e then if j 1 j 2 1 f 2 d d 1 2 1 d 3 2 1 3 2 2 5 5 where 1 2 if d 2 3 and 0 if d 4 while if j 1 j 2 2 f 2 e cd ad a 1 j 1 j 2 d d 1 2 d 2 2 1 d 2 2 2 d 3 2 1 3 2 2 5 6 the implicit constants in 5 5 and 5 6 may be taken to depend only on d lemmas 5 2 and 5 3 will be shown to follow from the geometric inequality careful counting and the following two lemmas let w a d j 1 aj j 2 d d 1 i j aj ai 2 d d 1 which we recall is the constant in front of the affine arclength lemma 5 4 under the hypotheses of lemma 5 2 there exists a borel set d j 1 j 1 1 d 1 j 2 j 2 1 with d t 1 td t 1 td dt 1 dtd d 2 1 1 2 d 2 1 5 7 and d e 2 where is a translate of d j 1 1 d j 1 tj furthermore if t 1 td d 1 2 1 2 and i j then tj ti w a

hypotheses of lemma 5 3 there exists a borel set d j 1 j 1 1 d 1 j 2 j 2 1 with d t 1 td t 1 td dt 1 dtd d 2 1 1 2 d 2 1 and d f 2 where is translate of d j 1 1 d j tj furthermore if t 1 td d 1 2 1 2 and i j then tj ti w a 1 1 2 1 1 2 2 e a d d 1 td ti e 2 a d d 1 td ti i 1 j d w a 1 1 2 1 2 e a d d 1 td ti i 1 j d j 1 j 2 2 w a 1 1 e a d d 1 tj ti i 1 j d j d mod 2 w a 1 1 e a d d 1 tj ti otherwise 5 9 again the implicit constants depend only on d 20 spyridon dendrinos and betsy stovall we now prove lemmas 5 2 and 5 3 assuming lemmas 5 4 and 5 5 the form of the lower bounds in 5 8 and 5 9 which is made possible by ordering the ti in the proofs of the lemmas allows us to give an extremely short proof compared with e g 5 18 19 proofs of lemmas 5 2 and 5 3 from lemmas 5 4 and 5 5 the argument is fairly standard so we will be brief for 5 4 e 2 d j t 1 td dt d d i 1 l ti 1 d 1 i j d ti tj e cd ad a 1 ti tj dt 5 10 furthermore on d 1 i j d tj ti 5 11 w a d d 1 2 e 2 a d 1 d d 1 t 1

compensated for by the gain in 5 10 since l t 1 d d 1 d d 1 l t 2 d d 1 t 5 4 follows by 5 7 and some arithmetic the deductions of 5 5 and 5 6 from lemma 5 5 are essentially the same with the small exception that if j 1 j 2 2 or if j 1 j 2 1 and d 4 then we use 5 9 with 0 we omit the details now we give the proofs of lemmas 5 4 and 5 5 in both cases we only give the full details when the dimension is even the odd dimensional case is similar proof of lemma 5 4 as in the proof of the restricted weak type inequality we manage to avoid the band structure argument entirely by ordering matters are more delicate for the strong type bounds because of the presence of the set e 2 but we nonetheless arrive at a vastly shorter proof than that in e g 19 to simplify the notation somewhat we define i w a 1 e 2 a d d 1 ji i i w a 1 e 2 a d d 1 ji i i 1 2 5 12 then for i 1 2 x f ji 1 ji ei x t dt i 5 13 ei 1 ei ji 1 ji f y t dt dy i 5 14 i i 1 5 15 uniform bounds for averages along degenerate curves 21 furthermore for t 1 td j 1 j 1 1 d 1 j 2 j 2 1 and 1 i j d 5 8 would follow from tj ti 1 2 if j d 1 if i 1 j d 1 mod 2 1 otherwise 5 16 since 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 for all 1 2 1 2 as in the proof of proposition 3 1 our argument is very much inspired by ideas from 22 and matters are much clearer in the double fibration formulation we define ui t x ji ji 1 r d x f x t ei i 1 2 given a measurable set u rd 1 we define set valued functions eu x t t x u fu y t t y t u observe that for every x y rd eui x fui y ji ji 1 furthermore eui x if x f fui y if y ei and eui x ei x t dt if x f fui y f x t dt if y ei if s r is a measurable set with s 0 we define m s inf t t s 1 2 s we define f 1 2 x f m eu 1 x m eu 2 x u 1 2 1 t x u 1 x f 1 2 f 2 1 x f m eu 2 x m eu 1 x u 2 1 1 t x u 1 x f 2 1 for example if j 1 j 2 f 1 2 f and f 2 1 and vice versa if j 1 j 2 the functions x 7 m eui x are borel and hence the f i j and u i j are borel sets since u 1 u 1 2 1 u 2 1 1 u 1 2 1 1 2 u 1 or u 2 1 1 1 2 u 1 we consider first the case when u 1 2 1 1 2 u 1 we define u 0 t x u 2 x f 1 2 t m eu 2 x 2 4 5 17 u 1 t x u 1 2 1 t m eu 1 x 1 4 5 18 then if t x u 1 and t x u 0 t 1 4 1 2 furthermore for any x f 1 2 eu 0 x 1 2 eu 2 x 1 4 2 1 4 2 if x f 1 2 eu 1 21 x eu 1 x so if t x u 1 2 1 eu 1 x 1 2 eu 1 21 x 1 4 1 4 eu 1 21 x 22 spyridon dendrinos and betsy stovall thus by fubini u 1 1 4 u 1 2 1 1 8 u 1 to continue we define two refinement procedures for a set u u 1 let ue t x u eu x 1 2 u f uf t x u fu x t 1 2 u e then ue and uf are measurable sets moreover ue u u ue u x f eu x 1 2 u f eu x dx 1 2 u similarly uf 1 2 u we refine further defining u e t x ue t m eu x 1 8 u f u f t x uf t m fu x t 1 8 u e we claim that u e 1 8 u and u f 1 8 u indeed the former follows from the fact that if t x ue e u e x 1 2 eu x 1 8 u f 1 4 eu x 1 4 eue x and so u e 1 4 ue that u f 1 4 uf follows by a similar argument if t x u e s t 1 8 u f s x u m eu x eu x 1 2 eu x 1 4 u f and similarly if t x u f s t 1 8 u e s x t s u 1 2 fu x t 1 4 u e with u 1 as in 5 18 for 2 i d we define recursively u i u i 1 f i even u i 1 e i odd then u i u 1 2 1 u 1 for 1 i d and so by 5 13 and 5 14 if t x u i and cd 0 is sufficiently small s t cd 1 s x t s u i 1 cd 1 if i is even s t cd 1 s x u i 1 cd 1 if i is odd let t 0 x 0 u d for 1 k d and t 1 tk r k define x t 1 tk x 0 k j 1 1 j tj if k is odd x t 1 tk if k is even recalling that d is even we define 1 t t t 0 t x t u d 1 and for 2 k d 1 k t 1 tk k 1 r tk tk 1 cd k tk x t 1 tk u d k where k equals 1 if k is even and 1 if k is odd finally we define d t 1 td d 1 r td td 1 cd 1 2 td x t 1 td u 0 uniform bounds for averages along degenerate curves 23 that d j 1 j 1 1 d 1 j 2 j 2 1 and d e 2 follow from the definitions of u 1 u 2 by construction d d 2 1 1 2 d 2 1 which by the definition of the i and i implies 5 7 finally we must verify 5 16 since ti j 1 j 1 1 if 1 i d 1 and td j 2 j 2 1 the second lower bound is trivial the first third and fourth lower bounds follow from the fact that t 1 cd 1 t 2 td 2 cd 1 td 1 td 1 cd 1 2 td 5 19 this completes the proof in the case when u 1 2 1 1 2 u 1 if instead u 2 1 1 1 2 u 1 we define u 0 t x u 2 x f 1 2 t m eu 2 x 2 4 u 1 t x u 2 1 1 t m eu 1 x 1 4 then a similar argument to that given above yields a set d on which the mono tonicity noted in 5 19 is reversed so t 1 cd 1 t 2 td 2 cd 1 td 1 td 1 cd 1 2 td and from that it is easy to show that d satisfies the conclusions of the lemma proof of lemma 5 5 define j j as above that is i w a 1 e 2 a d d 1 ji i i w a 1 e 2 a d d 1 ji i then for t 1 td j 1 j 1

of and reversed were it not for the second case above tj ti 1 2 if i 1 j d and j 1 j 2 2 but this lower bound is actually trivial because if j 1 j 2 2 and i 1 j d then tj ti j 1 j 2 1 1 1 2 assuming that the dimension d is even we argue as in the proof of lemma 5 4 to construct our parameter set d j 1 j 1 1 d 1 j 2 j 2 1 so that exactly one of the following holds for every t 1 td d t 1 cd 1 t 2 t 2 cd 1 t 3 td 2 cd 1 td 1 td 1 cd 1 2 td or t 1 cd 1 t 2 t 2 cd 1 t 3 td 2 cd 1 td 1 td 1 cd 1 2 td the lower bound 5 20 is immediate and so the lemma is proved the remainder of the section will be devoted to the proof of theorem 2 3 proof of theorem 2 3 the rough outline of our argument follows that of christ in 2 but some substantial modifications are made to deal with the weight and the variability of some of these modifications are similar to those made in 7 and some are new 24 spyridon dendrinos and betsy stovall we let p pd q qd and begin by proving that t is of weak type p q for each 0 1 since t is a positive operator it suffices to show that t f f d a ad a 1 f 1 q whenever f is a borel set f k 2 k ek with the ek disjoint borel sets and 1 2 f lp 1 the subscripts denote the

ek 1 p f 1 q t j ek f ek 1 p f 1 q we claim that t f f 0 1 0 cd k k j j k 2 k t j ek f where the outer sums are taken over dyadic values of that we may take 1 follows from our assumption that 2 kp ek

j 1 j 2 j and that t 0 j is of strong type is elementary thus t j is indeed of restricted weak type p q by interpolation for each pair j k define f j k x f t j ek x t j ek f 2 f e j k y ek t j f j k y

certainly imply 5 23 by summing on dyadic values of 1 2 satisfying 5 24 we start with 5 25 which we will prove by contradiction we know that 1 2 j 1 ek j j e j k 2 j 1 ek by cauchy schwarz j j e j k ek j j e j k ek 1 2 j j e j k 2 1 2 ek 1 2 j j e j k j 1 6 j 2 e j 1 k e j 2 k 1 2 so if j j e j k 4 ek j 1 ek 2 d ek j 1 6 j 2 e j 1 k e j 2 k d ek j 2 sup j 1 6 j 2 e j 1 k e j 2 k hence there exist

thus t j ek f d t 1 j ek f t 0 j ek f 1 d t 1 j ek f f 1 thus if j j k with a little more arithmetic we arrive at t 1 j ek f d 1 ek 1 p 1 f 1 q 1 26 spyridon dendrinos and betsy stovall by the

affine arclength measure on polynomial curves we can use the techniques of this section together with a geometric inequal ity for polynomial curves from 8 to prove uniform fractional integral analogues proposition 5 7 let r rd be a polynomial curve of degree n and let z be any finite set containing the real parts of the complex zeroes of l then the operator t f x r f x t t dt dist t z 1 satisfies t f lq rd f lp rd 5 31 for all 0 1 and p 1 q 1 on the line segment with endpoints pd qd and 1 pd 1 qd the implicit constant in 5 31 depends only on d and n and z a related estimate will also appear in 21 proof it was proved in 8 that we may decompose r as a union of intervals r cd n j 1 in such a way that for each j and t 1 td i d j j t 1 td d j 1 l tj 1 d i j ti tj with implicit constants depending only on d n by the triangle inequality it suffices to prove the estimates for i for a single interval i ij as above we will use the following simple and widely known polynomial lemma cf 8 lemma 5 8 we may decompose i c z j 1 ij so that for t ij dist t z t a ij and l t c ij t a ij k ij here a ij z and 0 k ij degl and the implicit constants depend only on the degree of l the proof is very short so we include it here proof making an initial decomposition if necessary we may assume that dist t z t a 0 t i translating if needed we may assume that a 0 0 and by reordering z a 0 a 1 am where 0 a 0 a 1 am for convenience set am 1 define aj t i 1 2 aj t 1 2 aj 1 0 j m and observe that i aj repeating some of the aj if necessary we may write p t c m j 1 t zj kj where aj re zj and the kj are allowed to be zero set bj imzj since t zj t aj bj p t c z i 1 ci m j 1 t aj kj i decomposing further if needed we may assume that a single one of the polynomials on the right is largest

that t e t these estimates immediately imply that on j e i l t c e k d 2 d 2 t j t 1 td c exp k d d i ti i j e ti e tj using the elementary estimate e ti e tj exp ti tj 2 exp 1 4 ti tj ti tj we obtain the lower bound in proposition 5 1 except without the gain of ad a 1 in the exponent nevertheless this is sufficient to apply the techniques of this section and obtain the proposition one could also obtain analogues of the above proposition and lemma for a rational curve proposition 5 7 gives a simple result bounding the unweighted operator s f x r f x t dt let nloc equal the maximum order of vanishing of l on r and nglob equal the degree of l let 1 2 n d d 1 1 observe that glob loc and that if glob loc t dist t z 1 1 thus we obtain the following corollary 5 9 let r rd be a polynomial curve of degree n the unweighted operator s f lq rd f lp rd for all p 1 q 1 in the convex hull of the points loc pd loc qd glob pd glob qd 1 loc qd 1 loc pd 1 glob qd 1 glob pd the dependence of the implicit constant on is unavoidable because of the lack of scale invariance this is the sharp lebesgue space result one could use a similar argument obtain optimal lebesgue space bounds for convolution with euclidean arclength on but the exponents would not be quite as simple 6 proofs of the geometric inequalities and other loose ends finally we give the promised proofs of propositions 3 5 3 8 3 9 and 5 1 we begin with proposition 3 5 recalling that lj l 1 j for 1 j d and that l 0 l 1 1 we define ak ld k 1 l d k 1 ld k 2 uniform bounds for averages along degenerate curves 31 we note that the quantities whose almost log convexity and monotonicity we had assumed are ld l d k 1 k ld k k 1 k j 1 aj j 6 1 it was proved in 4 see also 8 that if we define j 1 a 1 and for 2 k d jk t 1 tk

for polynomial curves but the proof under our hypothe ses is unchanged we want to establish the geometric inequality jd t 1 td d j 1 ld tj 1 d i j tj ti this is just the case k d of the following

coordinates of by 1 if necessary we may assume that the lk and hence the a k are all positive on i since t 1 tk it is easy to check that the variables in the integrand of 6 2 are also ordered s 1 sk 1 and similarly for the dummy variables used in defining all previous jj from this and positivity of the a k it follows that the integrand in the definition of jj for j k is non negative on the domain of integration the lemma is trivial when k 1 let us assume that the estimate for jk 1 is valid reparametrizing t 7 t if necessary and applying our almost monotonicity hypothesis if needed we may assume that ld l d k k 1 ld k 1 k t 1 c ld l d k k 1 ld k 1 k t 2 for all t 1 t 2 6 5 by the induction hypothesis and the positivity remarked above jk t 1 tk k j 1 ak tj t 2 t 1 tk tk 1 jk 1 s 1 sk 1

proof of the lemma and thereby proposition 3 5 now we turn to proposition 3 8 recall that we assume that i rd is a cd curve and that the geometric inequality relating j and l holds we want to prove that the geometric inequalities 3 19 3 21 hold these estimates were proved in the polynomial case in 7 but certain aspects of that proof do not readily generalize we give the details for 3 19 only which we restate for the convenience of the reader assume that d 1 2 d and recall that 2 d t 0 y 0 s 1 t 1 sk tk tk y 0 k j 1 sj tj 1 tj and that 3 19 is the inequality det d d 1 t 0 y 0 s 1 t 1 sd td

argument using elementary matrix manipulations we may write det 1 1 t 0 t 2 d 1 2 d 1 j d 1 tj tj d det 1 1 0 0 t 0 t 0 t 1 td 1 td 1 t 2 d 1 2 d 1 j d 1 tj tj d f t 0 t 2 d 1 6 8 where s t 1 t s t s t 6 s s t s since d 2 and cd c 1 which implies that f c 1 as well we use the product rule and apply the derivatives in 6 7 to the right side of 6 8 but the contribution from any term in which the derivative falls on f is zero thus 2 d 1 j d 1 j tj tj d det 1 1 t 0 t 2 d 1 f t 0 td t 1 td 1 on the set where tj 6 tj d for all d 1 j 2 d 1 by our assumption that 3 1 holds f t 0 t 2 d 1 2 d 1 i 0 l tj 1 2 d 0 i j 2 d 1 tj ti 2 d 1 j d 1 tj tj d so 3 19 follows from the continuity of both sides of this inequality and a careful accounting of the ti next we prove proposition 3 9 which asserts the near injectivity of the iteration maps for the restricted x ray transform under the hypothesis that j t 1 td is nonzero whenever the ti are distinct proof of proposition 3 9 the argument is very much inspired by an argument in 9 we will give the details for d 1 s 0 x 0 in the case d 1 2 d recalling 3 20 and fixing r 1 d we estimate t s d 1 s 0 x 0 t x t u t u 6 9 where t u d j 1 uj tj t u id rd ti 6 tj i 6 j ui 6 0 i d i 1 ui s 0 34 spyridon dendrinos and betsy stovall if the cardinality of the right side of 6 9 is greater than d there exist distinct points t u t u id rd such that t u t u t 1 td t 1 t d ui u i 6 0 for all i and ui u i by collecting like terms we may rewrite the equation t u t u as j 1 vj wj 0 for some 2 2 d d 1 w 1 w t 1 td t 1 t d with w 1 w and nonzero vj satisfying j vj 0 by inserting extra points between w 1 and w 2 allowing some of the vj to be zero and relabeling if needed d 1 j 1 vj wj 0 for some w 1 wd in i and vj r not all zero with j vj 0 let k k j 1 vj 1 j d then d j 1 j wj wj 1 0 by our assumption on the vj the j are not all zero so wj wj 1 d j 1 is linearly dependent combining this with the fundamental theorem of calculus and multilinearity of the determinant 0 det w 2 w 1 t 1 dt 1 wd 1 wd td dtd w 2 w 1 wd 1 wd det t 1 td dt 1 dtd but since t 1 td on the domain of integration our assumption on j implies that the right side is nonzero a contradiction tracing back this implies that d 1 s 0 x 0 has the claimed almost injectivity we leave the details in the remaining cases to the interested reader finally we prove proposition 5 1 which asserts that the estimates l t e t d j 1 ai d j 1 aj j 1 i j d aj ai j t 1 td d i 1 l ti 1 d 1 i j d ti tj e cd ad a 1 ti tj hold on and d respectively for some sufficiently large 0 provided t e a 1 t

repetition from 6 we merely sketch the details for arguments that already appear there using a continuity argument and 2 7 we may choose sufficiently large that the lk do not change sign on and satisfy lk t e t k j 1 aj k j 1 aj j 1 i j k aj ai 1 k d applying an affine transformation we may assume that the lk are all positive on thus the ak satisfy ak t c k e t ad k 1 ad k 1 k d 1 e ta 1 k d
