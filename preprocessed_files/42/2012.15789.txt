q for which local averages along graphs of a class of two variable polynomials in r 3 are of restricted weak type p q given the hypersurfaces have euclidean surface measure we derive these results using non oscillatory geometric methods for a model class of polynomials bearing a strong connection to the general real analytic case 1 introduction in this article we establish the sharp range of restricted weak type p q inequal ities for averaging operators of the form 1 1 t f x 1 1 2 f x t x 3 t dt x x x 3 r 3 when is a mixed homogeneous polynomial satisfying 1 t 1 2 t 2 t for all 0 and some fixed 1 2 0 when dt is replaced by the affine surface measure detd 2 t 1 4 dt the range of p and q is known 12 7 with a range that is independent of and those result extends to hypersurfaces in rn for every n see theorem 2 1 when the euclidean surface measure is used instead as in 1 1 numerous subtleties are introduced in the case of a hypersurface with the euclidean surface measure only partial results exist for hypersurfaces in rn when n is greater than 2 for the euclidean surface measure ferreyra godoy and urciuolo completed the homogeneous poly nomial case for n 3 6 15 and the additive case t ti ai for every n 5 in addition for n 3 iosevich sawyer and seeger s work 10 includes results for convex surfaces based on multi type information more recently dendrinos and zimmerman 4 investigated this question when n 3 in the case that is a mixed homogeneous polynomial of two variables such polynomials form a natural model class because their members contain all anisotropic scaling limits of polynomials of two variables and because mixed homogeneous polynomials are related to the faces of the newton diagram for all real analytic functions thus techniques for these polynomials should give insight on how to proceed in a more general case in many cases the results in 4 were nearly optimal missing only the boundary while in other cases like t t 41 t 2 1 t 2 1 6 t 22 there remained an additional region between the conjecture and the theorem in this article we complete the mixed homogeneous picture obtaining the full range of lp lq estimates albeit restricted weak type at the endpoints we use an alternate approach to 4 which allows us to obtain the full range of re stricted weak type estimates for all such polynomials and which provides some clarification of the relationship between the euclidean versions of these results and 1 http arxiv org abs 2012 15789 v 1 2 jeremy schwend the affine versions more precisely we completely avoid using oscillatory meth ods instead using methods such as christ s method of refinements in 1 often complimented by additional techniques such as orthogonality arguments as in 3 in several places we modify the method of refinements to find the influence of lower dimensional curvature information in the simpler cases this is instead ac complished with minkowski s and young s inequalities finally for the cases where regions remain between the dendrinos zimmermann 4 results and conjecture we alter the method of refinement to exploit the geometric information of the surface in sections 1 and 2 we present two versions of our main theorem the former written fully in terms of the newton polytope and the latter written more in terms of the factorization of with notation similar to the results in 4 then section 3 and 4 will give further detail into our techniques along with an outline of our proof one additional key purpose of the techniques here will be to clarify the complex relationship between the affine measure results of oberlin 12 and gressman 7 restated in theorem 2 1 and the euclidean or push forward measure results proven here one hope is that the relationship between mixed homogeneous polynomials and general real analytic functions will allow for these methods to be greatly generalized additionally some of the concepts demonstrated here can be applied to analyzing the effects of curvature in a much broader class of problems for example in 13 which is a joint work of the author and stovall these concepts are applied to analyzing the effects of curvature in fourier restriction in this article we consider the averaging operator t f x 1 1 2 f x t x 3 t dt where x x x 3 r 3 where are polynomials satisfying the following definition definition 1 1 a polynomial r 2 r is mixed homogeneous if there exists 1 2 0 such that 1 t 1 2 t 2 t for all 0 to state our main theorem we need some additional definitions definition 1 2 let z 1 z 2 m 1 2 0 c 1 2 z 1 1 z 2 2 be a mixed homogeneous polynomial mapping of r 2 into r we will denote the taylor support of at 0 0 the newton polyhedron of and the newton distance respectively to be s 1 2 n 2 0 c 1 2 6 0 n conv 1 2 r 2 1 2 s d inf c c c n where conv denotes the closed convex hull and where d d is the intersec tion of the bisetrix x 1 x 2 with the newton polyhedron n next define r 1 all terms for which 1 0 and denote the z 1 reduced taylor support of as s r 1 1 2 s 1 6 0 which removes all z 2 axis terms from the taylor support of under this definition the newton polytope n r 1 of r 1 is a simple translate of the newton polytope euclidean averages along prototypical hypersurfaces in r 3 3 of z 1 let s r 2 be defined similarly and denote the reduced newton distance as d r max d r 1 d r 2 with r defined accordingly if d r 1 d r 2 then set r to be r 1 a mixed homogeneous function will be said to be linearly adapted if every factor of the form z 2 z 1 some r 0 has multiplicity less that or equal to d by this definition if is mixed homogeneous but not homogeneous then is already linearly adapted this ends up being equivalent to the definition given in 9 for brevity the proof of this equivalence is omitted finally let o denote the maximal multiplicity of any real irreducible over c z 1 z 2 factor of and denote the height of by h max d o theorem 1 3 let z 1 z 2 r 2 r be a mixed homogeneous polynomial with 0 0 0 0 if is homogeneous we additionally assume that is linearly adapted and that z 1 z 2 6 c 1 z 1 2 z 2 j for any c r i c j n then t is bounded from lp r 3 to lq r 3 in the restricted weak sense iff p q satisfy each of the following conditions 1 q 1 p 1 2 1 q 1 3 p 1 q 3 p 2 1 3 1 q 1 p 1 d 1 1 4 1 q d r 1 2 d r 1 1 p 1 2 d r 1 1 q 2 d r 1 d r 1 1 p 1 1 5 1 q h 1 h 2 1 p 1 h 2 1 q h 2 h 1 1 p 2 h 1 1 6 1 q 1 p 1 h 1 7 remark 1 4 since non degenerate linear transformations preserve lp lq norms up to a constant the assumptions that is linearly adapted and that 0 0 0 0 do not weaken the generality of the theorem remark 1 5 equations 1 5 1 6 and 1 7 only become relevant if d r 2 d h d 1 2 or h d 1 respectively remark 1 6 the two cases not covered by our theorem are when after a linear transformation 0 or zj 1 j 2 in the former case it is well known that t is bounded if and only if p q in the latter case it was proved in 6 that t maps lp boundedly into lq precisely when p q satisfy all of the following 1 q 1 p 1 q 1 2 p 1 q 2 p 1 1 q 1 p 1 j 1 this can also be shown with a proof similar to that in subsection 15 1 namely by interpolating l 3 2 l 3 and l l bounds after a dyadic decomposition for brevity this proof is omitted acknowledgements the author would like to immensely thank his advisor betsy stovall for proposing this problem and for her advice help and insight throughout this project the author would also like to thank s dendrinos for sending me an early preprint of 4 and d mu ller for his suggestion to rewrite the results in terms of the newton polytope this work was supported in part by nsf dms 1600458 nsf dms 1653264 and nsf dms 1147523 4 jeremy schwend 2 reformulation in this section we will state theorem 2 4 an alternate formulation of theorem 1 3 and prove in proposition 2 5 that these theorems are equivalent by way of background we restate a result of gressman theorem 3 of 7 for rd 1 r and x rd define the affine averaging operator a as af x rd 1 f x t xd t det d 2 1 d 1 dt where d 2 is the hessian theorem 2 1 7 let rd 1 r be a polynomial then a extends as a bounded linear operator from l d 1 d rd to ld 1 rd with operator norm bounded by a constant depending only on the dimension d and the degree of the polynomial in fact the restricted strong type version of this theorem due to d oberlin 12 suffices for most of our applications we will use this result extensively in proving theorem 1 3 definition 2 2 let 1 2 0 2 and let r 2 r we say is mixed homogeneous if for every 0 1 2 if is mixed homogeneous there exists a 1 2 0 2 such that is mixed homogeneous if is a not a monomial this is unique while for monomials uniqueness holds under the additional assumption 1 2 we denote this unique as we define homogeneous distance as dh dh 1 1 2 further there exist unique r s m satisfying gcd r s 1 such that s m r m the mixed homogeneous polynomial may be expanded as lf l 0 clz j rl 1 z k sl 2 for some j k cl we observe that dh js kr r s by the fundamental theorem of algebra we can factor as 2 1 z 1 z 2 cz 1 1 z 2 2 m 2 j 3 zs 2 jz r 1 n j with j real iff j m 1 m 2 for brevity we refer to the irreducible factors z 1 z 2 z s 2 jz r 1 simply as factors the homogeneous distance dh can be rewritten as dh s 1 r 2 rs n j r s consider det d 2 as we will show in lemma 6 5 and 6 2 if dh 6 1 is 2 2 dh mixed homogeneous so is mixed homogeneous and shares the same r and s with and its mixed homogeneity satisfies d dh 2 dh 2 if dh 1 is constant see 6 1 and we can say d 0 thus in either case we can factor as 2 2 z 1 z 2 cz 1 1 z 2 2 m 2 j 3 zs 2 jz r 1 nj with j real iff j m 1 m 2 euclidean averages along prototypical hypersurfaces in r 3 5 we will use the following proposition from 8 which follows from simple algebra proposition 2 3 8 let be a mixed homogeneous polynomial as in 2 1 or 2 2 and denote d as the homogeneous distance of 1 if min r s 1 then any irreducible factor of the form zs 2 z r 1 6 0 has multiplicity strictly less than d 2 if has a factor of multiplicity greater than d then every other factor of has multiplicity less than d let t denote the maximum multiplicity of any real factor of i e t max 1 2 nj j m 1 as we will see in proposition 6 6 our assump tions imply that 6 0 so t is well defined suppose t d by proposition 2 3 we can define 2 3 ft the unique factor of with multiplicity t when t d if ft is linear let denote its multiplicity in and if ft is nonlinear let n denote its multiplicity in if ft is linear and 0 interchanging indices allows for the assumption ft z 6 z 1 so we may expand z zj 1 z j lr 1 f ls t o f ls s t some l 1 and in any such case where t d ft is linear and 0 we set a ls if we are in any case such that is not defined in the preceding likewise a n we set it to be 0 we use the convention that 1 0 theorem 2 4 let z 1 z 2 be a mixed homogeneous polynomial with vanishing gradient at the origin and not of the form 1 z 1 2 z 2 j i c j n then for 1 p q t is of restricted weak type p q iff the following hold 1 q 1 p 1 q 1 3 p 1 q 3 p 2 2 4 1 q 1 p 1 dh 1 2 5 1 q 1 p 1 1 2 6 1 q a 1 2 a 1 1 p 1 2 a 1 1 q 2 a 1 a 1 1 p 1 2 7 1 q n 1 n 2 1 p 1 n 2 1 q n 2 n 1 1 p 2 n 1 2 8 1 q 1 p 1 n 2 9 proposition 2 5 theorems 1 3 and 2 4 are equivalent proposition 2 5 will be proved in proposition 6 11 3 overview our strategy will be as follows we will use the mixed homogeneity of and by implication that of det d 2 which is comparable to the gaussian curvature to decompose 1 1 2 into dyadic level set strips on which 2 j and further decompose those strips into dyadic rectangles after a possible coordinate change on any such strip or rectangle we will have three useful restricted weak type lp lq estimates for p q young s inequality implies lp lq bounds with constant equal to the measure of the strip or rectangle since is nearly constant on each strip or rectangle theorem 2 1 gives us l 4 3 l 4 bounds on each dyadic strip and finally at p q 3 2 3 we will use bounds for averages on curves in r 2 11 and later 7 and either a variant of christ s method of refinements or 6 jeremy schwend in simpler cases minkowski s inequality with young s inequality to achieve either strong type or restricted weak type versions of l 3 2 l 3 bounds in some cases by summing over the dyadic regions summing over the minimum of the l 4 3 l 4 the l l and the l 3 2 l 3 bounds we can achieve restricted weak type bounds for t in the optimal range in some cases we also utilize the scaling symmetry of mixed homogeneous polynomials in this argument as demonstrated in proposition 8 4 however these methods are not always sufficient two types of obstructions can arise one issue is that degeneracies sometimes lead to a logarithmic factor in the lp lp bounds on the relevant strips to remove the logarithmic factor we use an orthogonality argument incorporated into christ s method of refinements found in 3 a more delicate issue arises when det d 2 possesses a factor ft of high multiplicity t d but all components of lack ft as a factor this causes the portion of the surface over our dyadic rectangles to have a structure more closely resembling a helix than a parabola or hyperbola as a consequence the image of any such dyadic rectangle under is highly non convex we can beat the above mentioned interpolation argument by quantifying this non convexity we use a variant of christ s method of refinements 1 to show that non convexity makes it impossible for l l quasi extremals to also be l 4 3 l 4 quasi extremals and we interpolate after quantifying this trade off further detail will be provided in the next section 4 outline we first decompose into the cases t d and case t d and we further break the case t d into the following cases case ft linear and 1 case a ft linear and 0 a 2 case n ft nonlinear and n 2 rectangular cases case i ft linear and 0 a 1 case iia ft nonlinear and n 0 case iib ft nonlinear and n 1 twisted cases where ft was defined in 2 3 to be the unique factor of detd having multiplicity t when t d when t d and ft is linear with 0 a cannot be 0 so this decomposition covers all cases where t d as we will see in corollary 6 4 in cases a and n t satisfies t 2 2 t a 2 and t 2 n 3 respectively in these cases on a local scale the graph of will resemble a rectangular piece of a paraboloid or a saddle we classify these three cases as rectangular cases in cases i iia and iib on the other hand t has no such restrictions and on a local scale the graph of has a helix like structure these cases will be denoted as twisted cases in section 6 we prove algebraic lemmas relating and its derivatives show that the hypotheses of theorem 2 4 imply that 6 0 show that if is homogeneous and t d it can only belong to case and prove that the two versions of our main theorem theorems 1 3 and 2 4 are equivalent section 7 is dedicated to proving that every condition stated in theorem 2 4 is necessary in section 8 we euclidean averages along prototypical hypersurfaces in r 3 7 exploit the mixed homogeneous scaling symmetry of to shorten the interpolation arguments in numerous later sections in section 9 we make a finite decomposition of the region 1 1 2 into neigh borhoods of each irreducible subvariety of detd 2 0 this induces a finite decomposition of the operator the most troublesome of these neighbor hoods which we denote by rt is the neighborhood of the subvariety ft 0 when t d we set rt we begin section 10 by showing in lemmas 10 2 and 10 3 that to prove theorem 2 4 it suffices to prove that t is of rwt pv 1 qv 1 for a specific pv 1 qv 1 satisfying qv 1 3 pv 1 and in cases n and a to additionally prove that t is of rwt pv 2 qv 2 for a specific pv 2 qv 2 satisfying p v 2 qv 2 3 pv 2 and to decompose t we define trf x r f x t x 3 t dt under these decompositions our proof of theorem 2 4 reduces to proving each of the following i t 1 1 2 rt is of restricted weak type 2 dh 2 3 2 dh 2 ii in the rectangular cases trt is of restricted weak type t 4 3 t 4 iii in the twisted cases trt is of restricted weak type 2 dh 2 3 2 dh 2 iv in cases n and a trt is of restricted weak type pv 2 qv 2 in section 10 we prove ii and when t 6 d we prove i in sections 11 and 12 we finish the proof of i when t d by incorporating an orthogonality argument into christ s method of refinements as in 3 we then prove iii in section 13 by analyzing the twisting of the graph of by quantifying the nonconvexity of the image of local regions under and using those calculations with a variant of the method of refinements finally in section 14 we turn our attention to proving iv we first begin by decomposing cases a and n into subcases based on the location of 1 pv 2 1 qv 2 in section 15 we complete the proof of iv by going through each subcase and proving that trt is of restricted weak type pv 2 qv 2 in each subcase our argu ment begins by computing restricted weak type 3 2 3 bounds over small regions in several of the subcases of case n this computation also involves a variant of the method of refinements we then proceed to interpolate the restricted weak type 3 2 3 bound with one or both of the restricted weak type and restricted weak type 4 3 4 bounds to achieve our result however one of the subcases denoted nscalq 2 p relies on a more complex argument that involves incorporating an orthogonality argument into the method of refinements similar to the argument in section 11 5 notation for the operator t most of our results will be bounds of restricted weak type t is of rwt p q with bound cp q w iff for all measurable sets e of finite measure t e lq w cp q w e lp cp q w e 1 p or equivalently if for all e f finite t e f cp q w e lp f lq cp q w e 1 p f 1 1 q we will sometimes use the notation t e f t e f 8 jeremy schwend we define 1 and 2 to be the projection onto the first and second coordinate in r 2 respectively so that 1 z 1 z 2 z 1 and for g r 2 we denote g to be the span of g which would be a line whenever g 6 0 the notation conv s will denote the closed convex hull of s while conv s will refer to the lebesgue measure of the convex hull to represent mixed lebesgue norm spaces we will use the notation f u t lau 2 l b u 1 u 3 lct t s f u t lc t s lb u 1 u 3 r 2 la u 2 r we will sometimes need to decompose the operator t if r r 2 is a measurable set we define 5 1 trf x r f x t x 3 t dt also unless otherwise stated we will use a b to imply that there exists a con stant c uniform except for a possible dependence such that a cb and simi larly for if we are incorporating extra dependence for instance dependence we will use finally a b is equivalent to a b and a b by a b d e we mean a d and b e also c will be a constant that can change from line to line which will depend only on unless otherwise stated 6 algebraic lemmas our first few lemmas will connect the form that and take lemma 6 1 if zj 1 z 2 z r 1 n o z 2 z r 1 n 1 some j 0 n 2 and r 2 then cz 2 j r 21 z 2 z r 1 2 n 3 o z 2 z r 1 2 n 2 some c 6 0 lemma 6 2 if zj 1 cz j lr 1 z ls 2 o z ls 1 2 some c 6 0 and l 1 with ls 2 and j 1 then cz 2 j lr 21 z ls 2 2 o z ls 1 2 some c 6 0 lemma 6 3 if zj 1 z 2 o z 1 2 some j 1 then cz 2 j 21 z 2 2 2 o z 2 1 2 some c 6 0 corollary 6 4 in case n t 2 n 3 in case a t a 2 and in case t 2 2 next we will prove each of these lemmas proof of lemma 6 1 making a change of variables we set x z 1 and y z 2 z r 1 then 2 z 1 2 x r 2 x 2 r 2 2 y 2 rx r 1 xy r r 1 x r 2 y 2 z 2 2 y and z 1 z 2 xy rx r 1 2 y so 2 x 2 y xy 2 r r 1 xr 2 y 2 y if xjyn o yn 1 with n 2 then the terms 2 x 2 y and xy 2 are both of o y 2 n 2 while the final term can be written as xr 2 y 2 y n 2 n 1 x 2 j r 2 y 2 n 3 o y 2 n 2 thus cx 2 j r 2 y 2 n 3 o y 2 n 2 some c 6 0 euclidean averages along prototypical hypersurfaces in r 3 9 proof of lemma 6 2 for zj 1 cz j lr 1 z ls 2 o z ls 1 2 2 z 1 2 z 2 z 1 z 2 2 the term z 1 z 2 2 is o z 2 ls 22 while 2 z 1 2 z 2 cj j 1 ls ls 1 z 2 j lr 21 z ls 2 2 o z ls 1 2 since ls 2 and since 0 0 implies that j 2 cz 2 j lr 21 z ls 2 2 o z ls 1 2 some c 6 0 proof of lemma 6 3 for zj 1 z 2 o z 1 2 with j 1 2 z 1 2 z 2 z 1 z 2 2 looking at each term separately z 1 z 2 2 j zj 11 z 1 2 2 o z 2 1 2 2 z 1 2 z 2 j j 1 zj 21 z 2 1 zj 1 z 2 2 o z 2 1 2 thus 1 j j z 2 j 21 z 2 2 2 o z 2 1 2 cz 2 j 21 z 2 2 2 o z 2 1 2 some c 6 0 proof of corollary 6 4 in case n min r s 1 by proposition 2 3 so after rescaling can be written as in lemma 6 1 with n n 2 implying that t 2 n 3 in case a after rescaling can be written as in lemma 6 2 with a ls 2 additionally if j were less that 2 then the hypothesis 0 0 of theorem 2 4 wouldn t be satisfied thus by lemma 6 2 t a 2 in case after rescaling can be written as in lemma 6 3 with 1 additionally if j 0 then z 2 violating the hypothesis 0 0 of theorem 2 4 thus by lemma 6 3 t 2 2 next we look at the relationship between the homogeneous distances for and its derivatives lemma 6 5 the homogeneous distances of and its derivatives obey the following relations d 2 dh 2 dh z 1 dh s r s and dh z 2 dh r r s proof since is mixed homogeneous there exists some m such that z 1 z 2 s m z 1 r m z 2 taking derivatives 2 2 z 1 z 1 z 2 2 z 2 z 1 z 2 2 s r m 2 z 1 s m z 1 r m z 2 2 z 2 s m z 1 r m z 2 2 z 1 z 2 z 1 z 2 2 2 s r m z 1 z 2 s m z 1 r m z 2 2 putting these together and using dh m r s 6 1 2 z 1 z 2 2 dh s m z 1 r m z 2 when dh 6 1 we can change variables using 2 2 dh to get 6 2 z 1 z 2 s m 2 2 dh z 1 r m 2 2 dh z 2 thus d m 2 2 dh r s dh 2 2 dh 2 dh 2 and when dh 1 is invariant under scaling implying that is constant and d 0 10 jeremy schwend next by symmetry it suffices to show the claim for dh z 1 dh s r s taking a derivative we get z 1 z 1 z 2 s m z 1 s m z 1 r m z 2 which becomes under the change of variables 1 s m m s m z 1 z 1 z 2 z 1 s m s z 1 r m s z 2 thus dh z 1 m s s r dh s s r and therefore by symmetry dh z 2 dh r s r next we want to show that if 0 then does not satisfy the assumptions of theorem 2 4 proposition 6 6 if is a mixed homogeneous polynomial with 0 0 and 0 then is a constant multiple of zj 1 z j 2 or z 1 z 2 j with r and j n consequently in theorem 2 4 is never identically 0 proof exclude the aforementioned cases then after possibly swapping z 1 and z 2 and rescaling either 1 zj 1 z 2 o z 1 2 some j 1 or 2 zj 1 cz j lr 1 z ls 2 o z ls s 2 czk 2 c z k ks 2 z kr 1 o z kr r 1 for some k l with c c c 6 0 and j k 2 in case 1 by lemma 6 3 cz 2 j 21 z 2 2 2 o z 2 1 2 6 0 in case 2 if max ls kr 1 then we can use lemma 6 2 by symmetry we need only consider ls 1 then for some c 6 0 cz 2 j lr 21 z ls 2 2 o z ls 1 2 6 0 lastly if max ls kr 1 then is homogeneous and case 2 simplifies to zj 1 c 1 z j 1 1 z 2 cj 1 z 1 z j 1 2 cjz j 2 with c 1 6 0 we want to show that if 0 then z 1 z 2 j for some for later convenience we will prove an even stronger statement here lemma 6 7 suppose that zj 1 c 1 z j 1 1 z 2 cj 1 z 1 z j 1 2 cjz j 2 with c 1 6 0 and suppose that o zj 12 then z 1 z 2 j with c 1 j and consequently 0 proof replacing c 1 with j we can write as zj 1 j z j 1 1 z 2 c 2 z j 2 1 z 2 2 cj 1 z 1 z j 1 2 cjz j 2 with 6 0 since z 1 z 2 j produces such a with c 2 cj fixed in terms of and j and since detd 2 0 it suffices to show that if o zj 12 then c 2 cj are uniquely determined by and j expanding there exist functions f 1 k and f 2 k for 2 k j such that 2 z 1 2 z 2 j k 2 jk j 1 k 1 ck f 2 k j c 2 ck 1 z 2 j k 2 1 z k 2 2 o z j 1 2 euclidean averages along prototypical hypersurfaces in r 3 11 and z 1 z 2 2 j k 2 f 1 k j c 2 ck 1 z 2 j k 2 1 z k 2 2 o z j 1 2 so there exist functions f 3 k 2 k j such that j k 2 jk j 1 k 1 ck f 3 k j c 2 ck 1 z 2 j k 2 1 z k 2 2 o z j 1 2 therefore o zj 12 implies that for k 2 3 j ck f 3 k j c 2 ck 1 jk j 1 k 1 and therefore inductively each ck is uniquely determined by j and and the lemma proof is complete then due to lemma 6 7 the proof of proposition 6 6 is complete corollary 6 8 theorem 2 4 holds in the case dh 1 and in the case dh 1 theorem 2 4 holds vacuously proof if dh 1 then is constant by lemma 6 5 if that constant is nonzero then theorem 2 1 applies while if 0 then theorem 2 4 holds vacuously by proposition 6 6 if dh 1 then d 0 by lemma 6 5 implying 0 so again theorem 2 4 holds vacuously next we show that homogeneous can only belong to to a couple cases of theorem 2 4 proposition 6 9 if is homogeneous and satisfies the hypotheses of theorem 2 4 then either t d or belongs to case consequently in case a and twisted case i we have max r s 2 proof if is homogeneous then every factor of is linear thus when t d can only belong to case case a or twisted case i if belongs to case a then after a linear change of coordinates and rescaling zj 1 cz j a 1 z a 2 o z a 1 2 a 2 c 6 0 and by lemma 6 2 or corollary 6 4 t a 2 also d 2 dh 2 2 j 2 2 j 2 but since c 6 0 implies that a j then t d is impossible resulting in a contradiction if belongs to case i then after a linear change of coordinates and rescaling zj 1 cz j 1 1 z 2 o z 2 2 c 6 0 and cz m 1 z t 2 o z t 1 2 somem some c 6 0 then t d 2 dh 2 2 j 2 2 j 2 so t j 1 thus o zj 12 and by lemma 6 7 0 and z 1 c j z 2 j so violates the hypotheses of theorem 2 4 remark 6 10 the argument for case a in proposition 6 9 also implies that if zj 1 cz j ls 1 z ls 2 o z ls 1 2 with ls 2 and z 2 has multiplicity t d in then j ls and zj 1 cz j 2 some c 6 0 we will now complete the proof of proposition 2 5 proposition 6 11 theorems 1 3 and 2 4 are equivalent we begin with three technical lemmas lemma 6 12 the newton distance d equals max dh 12 jeremy schwend proof of lemma 6 12 first the newton diagram of a mixed homogeneous poly nomial will have at most 3 edges a horizontal edge y 2 corresponding to the multiplicity of z 2 in a vertical edge x 1 corresponding to the multiplicity of z 1 in and an edge corresponding to the mixed homogeneity of which if extended into an infinite line would intersect the bisectrix at dh dh one can check that z 1 z 2 z dh 1 z dh 2 is still mixed homogeneous to verify this thus since the bisec trix intersects the newton diagram at d d then d max 1 2 dh if 1 dh then by lemmas 6 3 and 6 5 z 1 has multiplicity greater than d in so by our definitions 1 similarly for 2 likewise if dh then after linearly adapting as is assumed by theorem 1 3 will be the multiplicity of either z 1 or z 2 in so 1 or 2 thus d max 1 2 dh max dh lemma 6 13 if max a d r 2 d then a d r proof of lemma 6 13 suppose d r 2 d then since d r d and therefore by lemma 6 12 d r dh the bisectrix must intersect the newton diagram of r on a vertical or horizontal edge and so we have that c 1 z j 1 c 2 z k 1 z d r 2 o z d r 2 some j 1 k 0 c 1 c 2 6 0 up to a swapping of z 1 and z 2 then by lemma 6 2 and lemma 6 5 since d r 2 dh z 2 will have multiplicity greater than d as a factor of so by the definition of a d r a similarly suppose a 2 d then by lemma 6 12 a 2 dh so by lemma 6 5 a 2 d since a 6 0 then after a possible swap of z 1 and z 2 and rescaling z zj 1 cz k 1 f a t o f a t some j 1 k 0 c 6 0 by the definition of a where ft 6 z 1 is linear then after a linear transformation we can use lemma 6 2 to find that ft has multiplicity greater than d in then belongs to case a so by lemma 6 9 cannot be homogeneous so ft z 2 up to a constant then r 2 z k 1 z a 2 o z a 2 so since a dh the bisectrix will intersect the newton diagram of r 2 on a vertical or horizontal edge at a a implying that d r 2 a thus d r a 2 d so by the first part of the proof d r a lemma 6 14 if max n h d 1 2 then n d proof of lemma 6 14 suppose h d 1 2 since h max d o this implies that h o the maximal multiplicity of the real irreducible factors of since all the linear factors of have multiplicity not exceeding d by our linearly adapted assumption any factor associated with o must be nonlinear since d dh by lemma 6 12 then by lemma 6 5 h d 3 2 since 0 0 and 0 0 imply that d 1 2 then o h 1 additionally since d dh then o dh so by proposition 2 3 min r s 1 therefore lemma 6 1 can be applied to with h n implying that the factor associated with h will have multiplicity greater than d in so by the definition of n h o n similarly suppose n d 1 2 since n dh by lemma 6 12 then by proposition 2 3 n is the highest multiplicity of any real irreducible factor of so n o h now we turn to the proof of proposition 6 11 by proving proposition 2 5 proof of proposition 2 5 inequality 2 4 is equivalent to the validity of 1 2 and 1 3 by lemma 6 12 the validity of 2 5 and 2 6 is equivalent to 1 4 euclidean averages along prototypical hypersurfaces in r 3 13 if max a d r 2 d then by lemma 6 12 2 7 follows from 2 4 2 5 and 2 6 while 1 5 follows from 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 if max a d r

h d 1 2 2 8 is equivalent to 1 6 and 2 9 is equivalent to 1 7 this completes the proof of proposition 6 11 and likewise proposition 2 5 7 necessary conditions the necessity of each bound in theorems 2

necessity of 1 q a 1 2 a 1 1 p 1 2 a 1 in case a by duality the necessity of 1 q 2 a 1 a 1 1 p 1 follows in this case it suffices to consider zj 1 z j lr 1 z a 2 o z a 1 2 a 2 then choose e 1 2 1 3 3

inequality duality and real interpolation it suffices to prove that t e f e 1 p f 1 q for all relevant vertices we recall from section 4 that we can divide our problem into three broad cases the case t d the rectangular cases and the twisted cases and further decom pose the rectangular cases into cases a and n lemma 10 2 the polygon described in theorem 2 4 has exactly one relevant ver tex denoted 1 pv 1 1 qv 1 that lies on the line q 3 p if we are in the twisted cases case or if t d this is the only relevant vertex in cases n and a there exists exactly one additional relevant vertex 1 pv 2 1 qv 2 and this additional vertex satisfies 1 pv 2 1 qv 2 conv 0 0 3 4 1 4 2 3 1 3 this lemma follows by simple algebra with the boundaries in theorem 2 4 for the rest of sections 10 13 we will focus on the first relevant vertex lemma 10 3 for the polygon described in theorem 2 4 1 pv 1 1 qv 1 3 d 4 1 d 4 in the twisted cases and case t d in the rectangular cases 1 pv 1 1 qv 1 3 t 4 1 t 4 proof in

less than or equal to d when nj likewise j is greater than d trj is of rwt t 4 3 t 4 together proposition 10 4 and lemma 10 3 imply the following corollary corollary 10 5 the operator t 1 1 2 rt is of rwt p q for 1 p 1 q lying in the poly gon of theorem 2 4 additionally in the rectangular cases trt is of rwt pv 1 qv 1 we will spend the remainder of this section proving proposition 10 4 in all cases except when nj or j equals d the remaining cases will be handled in sections 11 and 12 the following lemma will allow us to use ho lder s inequality to compute l l bounds which will be useful in interpolation lemma 10 6 let be the standard lebesgue measure on r 2 the regions in the dyadic decomposition of satisfy the following inequalities r 0 2 m 2 m d ri 2 m 2 m max i d for i 1 2 whenever i

next on r 2 we have z 2 s z 1 r so for sufficiently small zs 2 iz r 1 z 1 r for all i thus z 1 q z 2 2 for some q satisfying qs 2 r r s d therefore after a few elementary calculus calculations r 2 2 m

trj 2 m and denote hj max j d for j 1 2 hj max nj d for j 3 and h 0 d we assume that nj likewise j is not equal to d by ho lder s inequality and lemma 10 6 tj m 2 m hj in addition by theorem 2 1 tj m 4 3 4 2 m 4 combining these trj e f m min 2 m hj f 2 m 4 e 3 4 f 3 4 e 3 hj 4 f 1 1 hj 4 thus trj is of rwt hj 4 3 hj 4 1 proposition 10 7 implies proposition 10 4 in all cases except when nj or j equals d however if we extend lemma 10 6 to the remaining cases the measures and thereby the l l bounds will contain logarithmic terms which are undesirable for the interpolation performed in proposition 10 7 to avoid this we will show in sections 11 and 12 that for q arbitrarily large the rwt q 3 q bounds lack the extra logarithmic term by proving the following lemma lemma 10 8 if nj or j equals d then tre j 1 is of rwt q 3 q for all q satisfying 4 q by proposition 8 4 we are in case 1 as defined after the proof of that proposi tion this lemma implies the following corollary corollary 10 9 if nj or j equals d then tre j is of rwt d 4 3 d 4 together proposition 10 7 and corollary 10 9 imply proposition 10 4 in sec tions 11 and 12 we will complete our argument by proving lemma 10 8 with an argument that will have further applications in later sections 11 application of method of refinements we begin our argument by looking at a general subset s of r 2 which is then subdivided into smaller subsets n in light of section 10 for now consider s to be the set rej 1 where nj likewise j equals d and consider the sets n to be some sort of dyadic decomposition of s 20 jeremy schwend

suppose condition 1 fails then for m m arbitrarily large there exist e f such that n m en 10 m log 10 1 e by the pi geonhole principal there exists a finite m log 10 1 separated set m such that n en

then young s inequality theorem 2 1 since 1 and interpolation give us the result directly for s not bounded we will use the notation of notation 11 1 and set b 3 for the purposes of lemmas 11 2 11 4 by our hypotheses n 1 and since 1 on s then by theorem 2 1 tn l 4 3 l 4 1 uniformly in n thus by lemma 11 2 and lemma 11 4 it suffices to prove the following version of condition 11 3 lemma 11 6 let k

ekl with implicit constants independent of l k e f proof by symmetry it will suffice to prove the fl inequality fix u 0 fkl define 1 t k u 0 t t w t ek el then 1 tk ek el u 0 fkl for t 1 define 2 t s l w t s s fl then 2 t t l fl w t el finally we define r 6 and r 6 t s 1 s 2 r 6 t 1 si 2 t i 1 2 t s 1 s 2 u 0 t t si si i 1 2 since is a polynomial mapping r 6 into r 6 with detd 6 0 this map is o 1 to one off a set of measure zero since fl fl then fl 2 euclidean averages along prototypical hypersurfaces in r 3 23 detd t 1 s 1 s 2 dt 1 ds 1 ds 2 defining g t si t si we can ex pand the jacobian as follows detd t s 1 s 2 det g t s 1 g t s 2 g t s 1 dist g t s 2 g t s 1 which implies that fl 2 g t s 1 dist g t s 2 g t s 1 dtds 1 ds 2 by hypothesis 2 of proposition 11 5 after a possible reordering we can assume that that z 1 2 mk and z 2 2 md on m for each m additionally by our hypothesis sgn k l sgn d so 2 kd 2 ld and k l d k l d sincek 6 0 andk d and since k l k l are all sufficiently large g t s 1 1 g t s 1 max 2 kk 2 lk here we recall that t k and si l for i 1 2 fix t s 1 and denote g 1 t s 1 g 1 t s 1 which will be fixed and g 2 t s 2 g 2 t s 2 then the map s 2 7 g 2 t s 2 has a 1 st

the proof of lemma 11 6 hence by lemmas 11 2 and 11 4 with b 3 the proof of proposition 11 5 is complete 12 conclusion of case t d proposition 12 1 if j likewise nj equals d then satisfies the hypotheses of proposition 11 5 proof first consider the case j 3 if nj d part 1 of proposition 2 3 implies that min r s 1 by symmetry we may then choose s 1 and perform the following change of variables over rej x z 1 and y z 2 jz r 1 then z 1 x jrx r 1 y z 2 y 12 1 2 z 2 2 y z 1 z 2 xy jrx r 1 2 y 2 z 1 2 x 2 jr 2 x 2 r 2 2 y 2 jrx r 1 xy r r 1 x r 2 y 24 jeremy schwend and finally the determinant hessian detd 2 satisfies 12 2 2 x 2 y xy 2 jr r 1 x r 2 y 2 y the relation d t with y being a factor of of multiplicity t requires that cxt yt o yt 1 so in the region rej 1 x y 1 similarly when j 1 2 d t implies cz t 1 z t 2 o z t 1 2 after possibly swapping z 1 and z 2 so with the choice x z 1 y z 2 the last sentence also holds for j 1 2 by symmetry it suffices to consider cases with j 0 and regions with z 1 z 2 0 additionally we will focus on y 0 as the proof in the region y 0 is essentially identical next we decompose rej 1 z 1 z 2 z 2 jz 1 0 into n x 2 n y 2 n with n 0 1 2 by hypothesis 0 of proposition 11 5 it suffices to consider only n where n is sufficiently large which will allow us to make the asymptotics in the next paragraph work each n satisfies n 1 satisfying the first condition of proposition 11 5 the partial derivative z 1 satisfies z 1 cx jyl o yl 1 2 j l n for some j l n 0 thus z 1 satisfies the second condition of proposition 11 5 as long as j 6 l suppose j l then dh z 1 js jr s r j and since t d then by lemma 6 5 dh z 1 dh s r s d 2 2 s r s t 2 2 s r s combining these equations 2 s r s t 2 2 j n so for some m n 2 s m r s so 2 m s mr this can only be satisfied if m 1 and s r a similar argument leads to an identical result for z 2 hence except for the homogeneous case where s r 1 we have j 6 l and the final condition of the proposition 11 5 is satisfied next consider the homogeneous case all factors are linear so up to a linear transformation zt 2 is a factor of we can decompose our options for in the following way 1 zm 1 z 2 o z 1 2 with 2 2 zm 1 z 2 o z 2 2 3 zm 1 o z 2 2 4 zm 1 cz m 1 1 z 2 o z 2 2 by lemma 6 3 option 2 would imply t 0 so this case is trivial in option 1 cz 2 m 21 z 2 2 2 o z 2 1 2 by lemma 6 3 and since d t it follows that 2 m 2 2 2 t implying that m then z 11 z 2 z 1 z 1 2 2 n 2 n on n so the lemma conditions are satisfied in option 3 by remark 6 10 following proposition 6 9 zm 1 cz m 2 some c 6 0 therefore czm 21 z m 2 2 then z m 1 1 z m 1 2 2 m 1 n 2 m 1 n and since 0 0 0 and t 0 each require m 6 1 we are done finally in option 4 zm 11 z m 1 1 and since 0 0 0 requiresm 6 1 we are done thus in each case where d t the conditions of proposition 11 5 hold hence by proposition 11 5 the proof of lemma 10 8 and thereby proposition 10 4 is complete euclidean averages along prototypical hypersurfaces in r 3 25 13 twisted cases in this section we will prove that in the twisted cases the high order vanishing of has no effect on the lp bounds by proving the following proposition 13 1 in the twisted cases i iia and iib trt is of rwt pv 1 qv 1 a few concrete examples of functions falling into the twisted cases are z 41 z 2 1 z 2 1 6 z 22 z 5 1 z 3 1 z 2 9 40 z 1 z 2 2 case i z 41 z 2 1 z 2 z 2 2 case iia z 2 z 2 1 z 2 2 z 2 1 case iib first we will discuss the idea of the proof as before we will decompose rt 1 1 2 into suitable dyadic rectangles j k in rectangular cases the dominant factor ft of is also a factor of one or both components of which causes j k to be essentially convex in the twisted cases on the other hand the dominant factor ft of arises from a fortuitous cancellation and not in an obvious way from the structure of and this leads to twisting near the associated curve ft 0 because of this j k r 2 is highly non convex and similar to the neighborhood of a parabola in the method of refinements the jacobian determinant which is used to find l 4 3 l 4 bounds relies primarily on the convex hull of j k while the l l bounds are connected to the measure of j k hence j k being highly non convex causes the classes of l l and l 4 3 l 4 near extremizers to be disjoint and quantifying that tradeoff leads to a much better bounds implying that trt is of rwt pv 1 qv 1 with pv 1 qv 1 lying on the scaling line we start our arguments with two lemmas that will be necessary to show that j k is always highly non convex in the twisted cases lemma 13 2 set y z 2 z r 1 where r 2 if y is a factor of with multiplicity t d and y is not a factor of then y is not a factor of z 2 proof we express as a polynomial in x z 1 and y z 2 z r 1 by the hypotheses of theorem 2 4 and the lemma 6 zj 1 and y does not divide thus by the mixed homogeneity after rescaling xj clx j lryl o yl 1 for some j 6 0 cl 6 0 suppose l 2 from 12 2 j j 1 cll l 1 x 2 j lr 2 yl 2 o yl 1 thus y is a factor of with multiplicity t l 2 however since we require t d and we know d 2 dh 2 2 j r 1 2 then 2 j l r 1 from the cl term of we know that j lr l contradicting 2 j l r 1 thus l 1 in which case y is not a factor of y z 2 lemma 13 3 if y z 2 z r 1 r 2 is a factor of z 1 and a factor of with multiplicity t d but not a factor of then z 1 0 proof assume z 1 6 0 and let m 6 0 denote the multiplicity of y in z 1 defining x z 1 by lemma 13 2 we can write as follows for some c 1 6 0 after rescaling xj c 1 x j ry o y 2 26 jeremy schwend claim let m be the multiplicity of y in z 1 and suppose that m 6 0 and z 1 6 0 then y has multiplicity m 1 in proof first we rewrite in a way that preserves its relationship with z 1 while still taking advantage of the coordinates x and y x z 1 yy y z 1 xy since m 6 0 y is a factor of y z 1 of multiplicity m 1 and since c 1 6 0 and j r y is not a factor of xy additionally y is a factor of x z 1 with multiplicity at least m thus y is factor of of multiplicity m 1 since d z 1 mr k r 1 for some k and by lemma 6 5 twice the assumption d t and our above claim 2 mr 1 r 2 d z 1 2 dh 2 1 r d 2 2 1 r t 2 2 1 r m 1 2 1 r this simplifies to m 1 r 1 0 which is impossible by assumptions m 1 and r 1 hence z 1 0 next to shorten the remainder of the argument we will unify the twisted cases in case i we can assume that ft z 2 so that z 2 has multiplicity t in and multiplicity 0 in thus after rescaling because of mixed homogeneity can take the following form i zj 1 c 1 z j r 1 z 2 1 o z 2 zr 1 xj c 1 x j ry 1 o y xr for some j n where we used the change of coordinates x z 1 y z 2 for i similarly in cases iia and iib we can assume after rescaling that ft z 2 z r 1 so that z 2 z r 1 has multiplicity t in and multiplicity 0 or 1 respectively in thus after rescaling because of mixed homogeneity can take the following form iia zj 1 1 o z 2 zr 1 zr 1 xj 1 o y xr iib zj r 1 z 2 z r 1 1 o z 2 zr 1 zr 1 xj ry 1 o y xr for some j where we used the change of coordinates x z 1 y z 2 z r 1 for iia b also we can assume that r 2 by lemma 6 9 observe that in each case 13 1 dh j r 1 the following lemma will unify the form of lemma 13 4 in each twisted case for some a 0 b 0 6 0 can be written as z 1 z 2 x j 1 a 0 o y xr xj r b 0 o y xr proof in case i x z 1 and y z 2 and jzj 11 o z 2 c 1 j r z j r 1 o z 2 where by our definition of case i c 1 6 0 thus a 0 j and b 0 c 1 j r are both nonzero since if j r would violate the assumption 0 0 for cases iia and iib we will need to rewrite z 1 and z 2 in terms of x and y doing so we have z 1 x rx r 1 y z 2 y in case iia xj c 1 x j ry o y 2 and so x rx r 1 y y j rc 1 x j 1 o y c 1 x j r o y euclidean averages along prototypical hypersurfaces in r 3 27 by lemma 6 6 6 0 so by lemmas 13 3 and 13 2 respectively a 0 b 0 6 0 in this case iib xj ry o y 2 and so x rx r 1 y y rx j 1 o y xj r o y resulting in a 0 r and b 0 1 being both nonzero additionally we want to consider itself there exists some q such that xqyt o yt 1 xq tr y xr t o yt 1 where d q tr r 1 2 dh 2 2 j 2 r 2 r 1 by 13 1 thus q tr 2 j 2 r 2 so 13 2 xq tr y xr t o yt 1 x 2 j 2 r 2 y xr t o yt 1 next we decompose rt y xr 0 x 1 rescaling it suffices to only consider x c for some small constant c independent of x and y for simplicity we give details when y 0 the case y 0 being similar we first define in cases iia b function z x y x y xr and in case i we define z to be the identity thus in each case z x y z 1 z 2 dyadically decomposing rt we define m m 1 m 2 n 2 x m 2 m 1 ym xr m 2 m 2 and define curved rectangles m z x m 2 x m y m 2 y m along with extended rectangles e m z 1 2 x m 3 x m y m 2 y m denote t m t m to begin we want to refine e e m and f f m so that t m e f t m e m f m define e m w e t m f w 1 4 tm e f e f m u f t m em u 1 4 tm em f f m e m w e m t m em w 1 4 tm em fm em m then t m e m f m t m e f by an argument similar to the argument leading to 11 1 to proceed we will create a map and use the size of the jacobian to acquire the desired bound fix e 0 e m and define 1 t m and e 0 t t e 1 t f then 1 t m fm e 0 m next define for t 1 2 t s m and e 1 t s s em then 2 t tm em e 1 t m define the following t s 1 s 2 r 6 t 1 s i 2 t i 1 2 t s 1 s 2 e 0 t t s i s i i 1 2 since is a polynomial mapping r 6 into r 6 with detd 6 0 it is o 1 to one off a set of measure zero then e 2 m implies e m 2 detd t s 1 s 2 dtds 1 ds 2 expanding detd t s 1 s 2 det s 1 t s 2 t conv s 1 s 2 t 28 jeremy schwend where conv s s r 2 is the area of the convex hull of s implying that 13 3 e m 2 conv s 1 s 2 t dtds 1 ds 2 to proceed we will consider two regimes m c ym xr m x m y m and c ym xr m x m y m m x m y m for some sufficiently large constant c to be decided later for small m we will directly calculate the l 4 3 l 4 bound using theorem 2 1 and interpo late for the larger m we will instead quantify how far the set 2 t violates convexity and use 13 3 as follows lemma 13 5 let t 1 be fixed if m c ym xr m x m y m then conv t s 1 s 2 x j 2 r 1 m m xmym xj r m 3 on some subset t 1 2 t 2 2 t t 2 t 2 t with i 2 t 1 10 2 t we will use lemma 13 6 together with lemmas 13 7 13 14 to prove lemma 13 5 lemma 13 6 let be a c 2 curve in r 2 with curvature and such that the set of all unit tangent vectors of belongs to the same half quadrant or its mirror image let p 1 p 2 p 3 r 2 lie in a 2 neighborhood of and satisfy pi pj a for all i 6 j if a 40 max 2 inf 1 2 then conv p 1 p 2 p 3 a 3 proof there exist points p 1 p 2 p 3 on closest to p 1 p 2 p 3 respectively and since a 40 2 the points p i have separation at least a 2 since cannot be a closed curve by our hypothesis on tangent lines we can reorder indices such that p 2 lies between p 1 and p 3 on we translate and rotate r 2 so that p 2 0 and the tangent line of at 0 becomes horizontal we then reflect r 2 if needed so that lies in the upper half plain and so that p 1 lies in the left plain and p 3 in the right we can then write as the graph x g x of some function g where g 0 g 0 0 g 1 and g 1 2 inf 4 sup therefore g x 1 4 inf x 2 we recall that i projects points in r 2 onto their i th coordinate the separation of the p i must be at least a 2 and since g 1 then 1 p 1 1 p 3 a 2 2 therefore 2 p 1 2 p 3 1 16 inf a 2 therefore p 1 p 2 p 3 form a triangle of triangle with base and height greater than a 2 and 1 16 inf a 2 respectively since p i is within 2 of pi for each i and since a 40 max 2 inf 1 2 then p 1 p 2 p 3 form a triangle with base and height greater than a 2 2 and 1 32 inf a 2 respectively hence the triangle formed by p 1 p 2 p 3 has area a 3 using lemma 13 6 to prove lemma 13 5 will require us to identify a curve bound its curvature restrict the possible unit tangent vectors establish a minimal separation of points and show points remain in a neighborhood of the curve a suitable curve y or y will be defined in lemmas 13 8 13 10 the curvature will be bounded in lemma 13 8 lemma 13 11 will restrict the possible unit tangent vectors the minimal separation comes from lemma 13 7 and our lower bound on m and finally the neighborhood size h will be bounded in lemmas 13 11 13 15 euclidean averages along prototypical hypersurfaces in r 3 29 our goal will be to look at the structure of z x y and then use lemma 13 6 on the points s 1 s 2 and t to proceed we will consider x y z 1 m and analyze m define new coordinates t z 1 t s i z 1 s i i 1 2 where we recall that z was defined so that z 1 m is rectangular additionally define 1 2 sgn a 0 z 1 z sgn b 0 z 2 z by lemma 13 4 a 0 b 0 6 0 and 13 4 x y xj 1 a 0 a 1 y xr o y xr 2 xj r b 0 b 1 y xr o y xr 2 where a 1 and b 1 may be zero because and z are equal up to coordinate sign changes we can work purely with since 13 5 conv t s 1 s 2 conv t s 1 s 2 first we will show that x and 2 2 x y are strongly related lemma 13 7 let x y x x y y z 1 e m and define xm ym xr m and x j r m ym xr m as the x 2 uncertainty scales respectively then if either 2 x x y y 2 x y c or x c for a sufficiently large c then sgn x 2 x x y y 2 x y xj r 1 m x proof by 13 4 recalling that b 0 6 0 we have x 2 x j r 1 b 0 j r o y xr xj r 1 m y 2 x j 2 r b 1 o y xr xj 2 r m therefore since y y m in z 1 e m a change in y will only change 2 by at most c xj 2 r m y m c next consider x 2 x 1 since x 2 x j r 1 m then 2 x 2 y 1 2 x 1 y 1 x 2 x 1 x j r 1 m thus by the triangle inequality if 2 x 2 y 2 2 x 1 y 1 c or if x 2 x 1 c for some large c 0 then 2 x 2 y 2 2 x 1 y 1 x 2 x 1 x j r 1 m this concludes the proof of lemma 13 7 the next lemmas define and analyze the curves that will be used with lemma 13 6 lemma 13 8 for y y m 2 y m y x 7 x y has curvature y x j 2 r 1 m proof of lemma 13 8 by direct computation using 13 4 y x x j 2 r 1 a 0 b 0 j 1 j r r 1 o y xr x 2 r 2 a 20 b 2 0 o y xr 3 2 then since 0 x 1 and a 0 b 0 6 0 y x x j 2 r 1 x j 2 r 1 m concluding the proof of lemma 13 8 30 jeremy schwend lemma 13 9 let y y m 2 y m then there exists a function y 2 z 1 m r such that y 1 2 x m 3 x m r 2 z 1 m 1 2 1 y 2 2 2 z 1 m this lemma is equivalent to the following lemma lemma 13 10 let y y m 2 y m then for each 2 2 z 1 m there exists a unique 1 such that 1 2 y 1 2 x m 3 x m proof of lemma 13 10 recall that i is projection onto the i th coordinate 1 existence if 2 2 z 1 m there exists x y z 1 m such that 2 x y 2 now consider points in z 1 e m with minimal and maximal x values xm 2 y and 3 x m y since xm 2 x xm 2 x c and 3 xm x x m x c then 2 xm 2 y 2 2 3 xm y by lemma 13 7 then by continuity of y x and the intermediate value theorem there exists x 1 2 x m 3 x m such that 2 x y 2 y x 2 2 uniqueness by 13 4 1 d dx y x x 1 x y x j 2 a 0 j 1 o y xr 0 for each x y z 1 e m so for fixed y y m 2 y m the map x 7 1 y x 1 x y is one to one hence for fixed y 1 is mapped to by at most a single unique x and hence a unique 2 2 x y this concludes the proof of lemma 13 10 lemma 13 11 for every y y m 2 y m d d 2 y 2 1 10 and d 2 d 22 y 2 x j 2 r 1 m for all 2 2 m proof since x 1 x j 2 m and x 2 x j r 1 m then d d 2 y 2 x r 1 m 1 10 so the curvature of 2 7 y 2 2 is comparable to d 2 d 22 y 2 finally by lemma 13 8 the curve 2 y 2 2 has curvature x j 2 r 1 m concluding the proof of lemma 13 11 next define z 1 m e z 1 e m r 2 z 1 m and observe that z 1 m e satisfies 13 6 z 1 m z 1 m e z 1 e m the expanded image z 1 m e essentially rectangularizes our image z 1 m making it more practical for proving results lemma 13 12 the set z 1 m e satisfies z 1 m e 2 2 z 1 m min ym 2 2 ym 2 max ym 2 2 ym 2 2 proof since jac 0 on e m is an open map by the

such that 2 ym c 6 ym c 6 h 2 32 jeremy schwend since lemma 13 11 implies that 2 ym c 6 ym c 6 then h 2 now we will proceed with the proof of lemma 13 5 lemma 13 5 proof for fixed t there exist 1 2 t 2 2 t 2 t such that i 2 t 1 10 2 t and such that t 1 s 1 1 and s 2 1 and equivalently t 1 s 1 1 and s 2 1 are separated by at least 1 4 m ym c ym xr m x m c then by lemma 13 7 t s 1 and s 2 have mutual 2 separation of at least c where we can make c arbitrarily large by making the c on the lower bound of m sufficiently large fur thermore by lemma 13 15 the points t s i lie in anh 2 neighborhood of a curve and by lemmas 13 8 and 13 11 respectively that curve has curvature x j 2 r 1 m and derivative bounded by 1 10 which bounds the possible unit tangent vectors thus by choosing the constant on the lower bound of m to be large enough we can separate p 1 t p 2 s 1 and p 3 s 2 by a c c x j r m ym xr m for a sufficiently large c by choosing and so that and 2 h 2 the neighborhood

proposition 13 1 14 second relevant vertex case breakdown in lemma 10 2 we found that the polygon arising in theorem 2 4 has at most two relevant vertices with theorem 2 4 now proven for t 1 1 2 rt and proven at the first relevant vertex for trt we now turn our attention to proving theorem 2 4 for trt at the second relevant vertex we recall that the second vertex 1 pv 2 1 qv 2 exists only in cases n and a and belongs in the set conv 0 0 3 4 1 4 2 3 1 3 34 jeremy schwend either in the interior or on the boundary based on the location of 1 pv 2 1 qv 2 we further decompose cases n and a definition 14 1 define d conv 0 0 3 4 1 4 2 3 1 3 depending on the loca tion of 1 pv 2 1 qv 2 we break cases n and a into the following cases nint aint 1 pv 2 1 qv 2 int d nq p aq p qv 2 p v 2 1 pv 2

above subcases completely cover cases n and a and we will furthermore identify qualities of the functions that belong to each subcase lemma 14 2 every belonging to cases n or a belongs to one of the subcases of definition 14 1 additionally for each subcase the following hold where we refer to the line 1 q 1 p 1 dh 1 as the scaling line aint 1 pv 2 1 qv 2 lies on the scaling line when 1 pv 2 2 t 5 dh 1 dh 1 t 2 nint 1 pv 2 1 qv 2 lies on the scaling line when 1 pv 2 n 1 dh dh 1 additionally in this case n dh 1 nscalq 2 p 1 pv 2 1 qv 2 2 n 1 n with n dh 1 and n 3 n 6 scal q 2 p 1 pv 2 1 qv 2 2 n

to a rescaling and a reordering of z 1 and z 2 z 2 z 2 1 2 aq p 1 pv 2 1 qv 2 lies where the scaling line intersects the line q p and up to a rescaling and a reordering of z 1 and z 2 z 2 1 z s 2 for some s 3 proof in case a by corollary 6 4 t a 2 thus lines 1 q a 1 2 a 1 1 p 1 2 a 1 t 3 2 t 5 1 p 1 2 t 5 and 1 q 1 p 1 dh 1 intersect when 1 pv 2 1 qv 2 2 t 5 dh 1 dh 1 t 2 t 3 dh 1 dh 1 t 2 which proves the statement for subcase aint since dh 0 and t d 2 dh 2 2 qv 2 pv 2 3 is always satisfied additionally the inequality 1 pv 2 1 qv 2 1 is equivalent to 14 1 dh 2 t 2 t 4 which always holds when dh 2 to find when it fails since is not homogeneous in case a by proposition 6 9 then by the definition of a up to a rescaling and an interchanging of z 1 and z 2 zj 1 c 1 z ls 2 z j lr 1 o z ls 2 some j l 1 c 1 6 0 where a ls 2 and by corollary 6 4 t ls 2 then 14 1 is equivalent to dh 2 ls ls 2 also from the structure of dh js s r and j min lr 2 j cannot euclidean averages along prototypical hypersurfaces in r 3 35 be 1 since 0 0 0 when lr 1 we have l r 1 and dh js s r 2 s s 1 2 s s 2 2 ls ls 2 when lr 2 then r s r 2 ls 2 and dh js s r lsr s r 2 ls ls 2 when lr 2 and j 2 then r s r 2 ls 2 so dh js s r lsr s r 2 ls ls 2 thus qv 2 is always greater than p v 2 when either lr 6 2 or when lr 2 and j 6 2 however if j lr 2 then dh lsr s r 2 ls ls 2 implying that qv 2 p v 2 and since j lr 2 after rescaling can be written as z 21 z s 2 for some s 3 as was claimed for subcase aq p this completes the proof for the subcases of case a for case n when n dh 1 lines 1 q n 1 n 2 1 p 1 n 2 and 1 q 1 p 1 dh 1 intersect when 1 pv 2 1 qv 2 n 2 dh 1 dh 1 n 1 dh 1 dh 1 as stated for subcase nint then qv 2 pv 2 n 2 dh 1 n 1 dh 1 satisfies qv 2 pv 2 3 since 2 n 3 t d 2 dh 2 and qv 2 pv 2 2 is satisfied since n dh 1 furthermore since 1 pv 2 1 qv 2 2 n 3 2 dh 2 dh 1 then the inequality 1 pv 2 1 qv 2 1 is equivalent to dh 2 3 n first ifn 3 thenn dh 1 implies that dh 2 3 n next dh satisfies dh rn k r 1 for some k 0 in n 0 when r 2 or k 0 then dh rn k r 1 2 3 n therefore when n dh 1 if n 6 2 or k 6 0 or r 6 2 then qv 2 p v 2 however when r 2 k 0 and n 2 then n dh 1 and dh 2 3 n implying that qv 2 p v 2 and that up to rescaling and a swapping of z 1 and z 2 z 2 z 2 1 2 as was claimed for subcase nq p finally for case n with n dh 1 the lines 1 q n 1 n 2 1 p 1 n 2 and 1 q 1 p 1 n intersect when 1 pv 2 1 qv 2 2 n 1 n as stated for subcases nscalq 2 p and n 6 scal q 2 p thus when n dh 1 qv 2 pv 2 2 is always satisfied if n 3 then 1 pv 2 1 qv 2 1 now for some k 0 in n 0 depending on dh rn k r 1 thus when either n dh 1 or when n dh 1 and l 6 0 or r 6 2 n must be larger than 3 implying that 1 pv 2 1 qv 2 1 36 jeremy schwend alternatively when n dh 1 r 2 k 0 and n 3 then 1 pv 2 1 qv 2 2 3 1 3 and up to a rescaling and a swapping of z 1 and z 2 z 2 z 2 1 3 as was claimed for subcase n 2 3 1 3 this completes the proof for the subcases of case n 15 the rwt 3 2 3 bound and the second relevant vertex in this section we will go through each subcase from definition 14 1 proving that trt is of rwt pv 2 qv 2 and completing the proof of theorem 2 4 15 1 case aq p by lemma 14 2 after

define 1 t r 2 z t j k and u 0 t 1 t 2 t 1 z t w t ej k then 1 tj k ej k u 0 j k to achieve a lower dimensional result with the method of refinements we fix one variable rewriting 1 1 2 k t 2 2 k t 1

since ret is scale invariant then by case 3 of proposition 8 4 tret is of rwt ps qs where ps qs lies on the scaling line of t and 2 ps 2 qs 3 8 qi 1 qi dh 1 1 2 qi dh 1 1 4 qi 1 qi dh 1 1 2 qi dh 1 since ps qs lies on the scaling line then by lemma 14 2 it suffices to verify that ps pv 2 using the identities q 2 j r 2 b r 1 1 dh rn 3 t 2 n 3 dh j rn r 1 and our equation for 1 qi after some messy arithmetic we find that 1 ps n 1 dh dh 1 thus by lemma 14 2 pv 2 ps and so tret is of rwt pv 2 qv 2 15 5 2 case n 6 scal q 2 p in this case 1 pv 2 1 qv 2 2 n 1 n lies off the scaling line so we will be using rt instead of r e t we decompose rt z 1 z 2 z r 1 0 into regions j k x z 1 2 j y z 2 z r 1 2 k 1 1 2 where k and 0 j this induces the decomposition trt z 1 z 2 zr 1 0 j k tj k combining the

hypersurfaces in r 3 43 lemma 15 4 let k l n and let k l and k l be sufficiently large independent of e and f then fl 2 k l r 2 el fkl and el 2 k l r 2 fl ekl with implicit constants independent of l

achieve a lower dimensional result we fix one variable rewriting 1 1 2 k t 2 2 k t 1 2 k 1 t 1 t 2 dt 1 dt 2 therefore by ho lder s inequality there exists a fixed t 2 2 k such that 1 t 2 t 1 t 1 t 2
