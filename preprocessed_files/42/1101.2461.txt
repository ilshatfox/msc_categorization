of antonov and arias de reyna 1 introduction let f be an integrable function on the torus t which will be associated with the interval 0 1 in this paper we consider the walsh system of functions on 0 1 given by w 0 x 1 and for n 1 we write n r k 0 k 2 k in binary digits and define wn x r k 0 sign sin 2 k 1 x k we are reserving a lower case w for walsh wave packets defined in 2 the walsh system is a complete orthonormal system for l 2 0 1 and each f l 1 has the walsh fourier representation f k 0 f k wk f k 0 1 f x wk x dx the partial sums of the series above snf n k 0 f k wk are the concern of this paper strongly motivated by the close analogy between the walsh fourier series and fourier series the question addressed here and brought to our attention by the informative article of konyagin

will show in theorem 1 4 below our result comes close to resolving konyagin s conjecture 1 2 below let us recall the essential facts it is well known that integrability of f is not enough for this pointwise convergence via a counter example of kolmogorov 9 who in fact constructed an integrable function whose fourier series diverges almost everywhere carleson 3 showed in his seminal paper the almost everywhere convergence of the fourier series for f l 2 and hunt 8 observed extension of carleson s proof to lp 1 p these results were reproved by fefferman 6 and the approach of lacey thiele 14 is modified in this paper a result of konyagin 11 extending the work of many including 7 13 22 shows the following 1 1 theorem let be a increasing convex function such that t o t log log t as t then for any increasing sequence of integers nj there is a f l such that supj snjf x for all x 0 1 konyagin 12 has conjectured that the previous result is in fact sharp for lacunary subsequences of integers a sequence nj j 1 is called lacunary if inf j 1 nj 1 nj 1 below log x 27 max 0 log x 1 1 2 conjecture let nj j 1 be a lacunary sequence of integers if f x log log f x dx then snjf x f x for almost every x t the following result about arbitrary lacunary partial sums is formulated in 12 and is attributed to zygmund 23 it provides an integrability condition sufficient for convergence of fourier series better than what is known for the full sequence of integers see 7 1 3 theorem let nj j 1 be a lacunary sequence of integers if t f x log f x dx then snjf x converges to f x for almost every x t 1 with this definition you only need to have one log in the formulas on the convergence of lacunary walsh fourier series 3 our main results are the following which do not quite resolve konyagin s conjecture but do certainly indicate that for lacunary sequences one can have convergence for a much broader class of functions than that of the full sequence of partial sums 1 4 theorem let nj j 1 be a lacunary sequence of integers if t f log log f log log log f dx then the walsh fourier partial sums snjf x f x for a e x t furthermore sup j snjf 1 f l log log l log log log l 1 5 sup j snjf 1 f l log l log log l 0 1 1 6 note that in 1 5 and 1 6 we use the luxembourg norms on the right hand sides we ll recall some standard facts about these norms and orlicz spaces at the end of this section our proof will employ the time frequency analysis techniques introduced in lacey thiele 14 recalled in 2 with an additional key ingredient namely the multi frequency calder n zygmund decomposition introduced in nazarov oberlin thiele 16 in a calder n zygmund decomposition one decomposes a function into two parts where the good part is bounded and the bad part is localized to a family of intervals where it has cancellation properties the classical calder n zygmund decomposition requires the bad part have mean zero on each interval and in a multi frequency decomposition one requires certain modulations of the bad part to jointly have mean zero in 17 oberlin and thiele used a walsh paley variant of this decomposition to extend boundedness results for a walsh variant of the bilinear hilbert transform in this sense our proof is a continuation of this theme in our setting we are able to obtain improvement in carleson s theorem when the collection of frequencies is lacunary essentially the estimate of the good part in the multi frequency decomposition in 16 is based on hausdorff young s inequality it turns out that if the sequence n 1 n 2 is lacunary one can obtain an improvement of the hausdorff young estimate and this is the key to the improvement in theorem 1 4 the improvement of the hausdorff young estimate is due to zygmund 23 see proposition 3 3 below using the above ingredients we will be able to show the following refined distributional estimate cf t f t log log t f t 0 for any f majorized by f 0 1 see lemma 3 2 from this estimate the strong type estimate 1 6 follows easily to obtain 1 5 we ll use the extrapolation technique of antonov 1 which 4 yen do and michael lacey has been extended and generalized in arias de reyna 2 and carro mart n 4 details about the proof of theorem 1 4 are presented in 4 and 6 and more remarks about this intricate subject are included in 7 we recall standard facts about orlicz spaces and luxembourg norms 1 7 definition a function is an orlicz function if it is a convex non decreasing function on 0 such that 0 0 lim t t for a probability space p we set l to be those functions f such that for some c 0 we have e f c and then define the corresponding luxembourg norm of f by f l inf c e f c 1 if we write l i for interval i we mean that the probability space is i with normalized lebesgue measure and by l we mean that the interval is 0 1 2 tiles and time frequency algorithm we formulate the details of the walsh phase plane the linearization of the carleson operator that is used in the rest of the paper and some key details of the proof of carleson s theorem in 14 the walsh phase plane is the closed quadrant r r of the plane a dyadic rectangle is of the form 2 1 p i m 2 j m 1 2 j n 2 k n 1 2 k for integers m n j k a tile is a dyadic rectangle of area 1 and a bi tile is a dyadic rectangle of area 2 for a tile i we will refer to i as the time interval associated to p and as the frequency interval a bi tile p can be split into a upper half pu and a lower half p associated to a tile p is a walsh wave packet wp which in the notation or 2 1 is wp x wi x 2 j 2 wn 2 j x m 2 j it follows that wp has l 2 norm one is supported on i and is orthogonal to any wp where p is a second tile that does not intersect p on the convergence of lacunary walsh fourier series 5 the variant of the carleson operator we consider is defined as follows for a measurable function n r r we set 2 2 cf x p f wp wp x 1 x n x pu the sum is over all bi tiles p r r and we do not indicate the dependence of this definition on the choice of function n and the carleson theorem for the walsh phase plane is 2 3 carleson theorem for f l 2 r of norm one and g r of lebesgue measure one we have the estimate on the bilinear form cf g 1 where 0 g 1 g and the implied constant is absolute 2 4 remark the carleson operator 2 2 is the discretization of the maximal operator sup n 0 snf x c f 20 in our setting the supremum is taken over a lacunary subsequence therefore there will be the following additional restriction that will be in place in subsequent sections with a lacunary sequence nj j 1 fixed we can assume that the function n x in 2 2 is defined on a subset of 0 1 and range restricted to nj j 1 thus we only consider bi tiles p so that the upper half of the frequency interval of p contains at least one nj furthermore we can and will assume that for every bi tile p in the carleson operator the time interval ip is supported inside 0 1 in particular this means cf is supported inside 0 1 we recall the key elements of the proof of theorem 2 3 following the lines of analysis of 14 the set of bi tiles admits a partial order which we write as i i iff and only if i i and it follows that two bi tiles p p tiles are related by this order if and only if they intersect in the phase plane we then define 2 5 dense p sup p i p p x i g x n x p i if p is any collection of tiles we set dense p supp p dense p a tree is a collection t of bi tiles such that there is a non unique bi tile it t such that p it t for all p t we define sizef p sup t it 1 p t p it t f wp 2 1 2 6 yen do and michael lacey where the supremum is formed over all trees t p it is essential to note that the sum is restricted to those tiles p t for which the lower half p does not intersect the top of the tree we add the subscript f as in the application of these concepts we will be changing f we we will write energy p a if the collection of bi tiles p is the union of trees t t such that t t it a these next lemmas give a quick proof of carleson s theorem and we will have recourse to them and their consequences in this paper 2 6 density lemma any collection of tiles p can be written as psmall pbig where these conditions hold 1 dense psmall 12 dense p 2 energy pbig dense p 1 g recall the role of the set g in theorem 2 3 and 2 5 2 7 size lemma any collection of tiles p can be written as psmall pbig where these conditions hold 1 sizef psmall 12 sizef p 2 energy pbig sizef p 2 f 22 note the role of l 2 in this estimate for collections of tiles p we will use the notation 2 8 bp f g p p f wp wp 1 x n x pu g 2 9 tree lemma for any tree t we have the estimate bt f g dense t sizef t it the next lemma relates the concept of size to that of the maximal function of f it is a consequence of the calder n zygmund theory associated with trees 2 10 lemma let f l 1 a 0 and let p be a collection of bi tiles so that for all i p we have i mf a we then have 2 11 sizef p a in particular size is bounded by the l norm of f on the convergence of lacunary walsh fourier series 7 to illustrate the time frequency algorithm used in this paper let us give a proof of carleson s theorem conditional on the lemmas above proof of carleson s theorem we can assume that f l 2 l then by 2 11 it follows that we have an upper bound on the size of the collection of all tiles pall hence we have both the size and density lemmas available appropriate inductive application of them leads to a decomposition of pall into collections pn for n z such that 1 dense pn min 1 2 n 2 sizef pn 2 n 2 3 energy pn 2 n note that the density is never more than one and that energy estimate matches the conclusions of the size and density lemmas in particular pn is the union of trees t tn such that we can estimate p pn f wp wp 1 x n x pu g min 1 2 n 2 n 2 t tn it min 1 2 n 2 n 2 min 2 n 2 2 n 2 n z the latter estimate is summable over n z so the proof is complete in subsequent sections the following situation will appear suppose that a collection p of tiles satisfies 2 12 energy p dense p 1 g it follows that one has the estimate bp f g dense p sizef p energy p g sizef p we can do better than this estimate if it is more effective to apply the size lemma this leads to the following lemma also see 15 2 13 lemma assume that p satisfies 2 12 and let f l 2 we have the following estimate 2 14 bp f g min sizef p g dense p 1 2 g f 2 proof the first estimate follows immediately from assumptions and the tree lemma so we assume that the second term on the right in 2 14 is the smaller of the two that is we assume that we have the inequality sizef p 2 f 22 1 g 8 yen do and michael lacey where we set dense p the left hand side of the last display is exactly the estimate on energy that we would get by application of the size lemma hence it is more efficient to apply the size lemma until the energy estimate it provides matches the right hand side of 2 12 to be precise set integer n 0 to be the integer part of log 2 f 22 g 1 and write p as the union of collections pn for n n 0 where the collections pn satisfy 1 dense pn 2 size pn 2 n 2 3 energy pn 2 n f 22 this decomposition is obtained by solely applying the size lemma until the last step when n n 0 when the conclusions will follow from the assumption 2 12 we then have bpn f g 2 n 2 f 22 which is a geometric series which sums to its at most a constant times it largest term for n n 0 yielding our lemma 3 a restricted weak type inequality in this and the subsequent sections we shall fix a lacunary sequence 0 n 1 n 2 nn of frequencies all the implicit constants in the estimates will be independent of n but depends on the lacunarity constant inf j nj 1 nj 1 recall the definition of the carleson operator c in 2 2 the observations of remark 2 4 will be in force and we will use the notation for the bilinear form bp in 2 8 3 1 definition to say that g is a major subset of a set g means that g g and g 1 2 g 3 2 lemma let f g 0 1 then there is a major subset g of g such that if f is dominated by f and g is dominated by g then cf g f log log g f we recall the following key inequality of zygmund 23 which can be viewed as an improvement of hausdorff young s inequality in the lacunary setting 3 3 proposition let nj j 1 be a lacunary sequence of integers we have the inequality f nj j 1 2 f l log l 1 2 on the convergence of lacunary walsh fourier series 9 we only indicate the proof here the dual space of l log l is the space exp l 2 which is the orlicz space associated with the orlicz function ex 2 1 moreover there is a version of the khintchine inequality which holds for the walsh paley functions wnj j 1 which is phrased in terms of the exp l 2 norm namely 3 4 j 1 ajwnj x exp l 2 aj j 1 2 we can then prove the zygmund inequality as follows for f l log l 1 2 let j 1 f nj wnj be the projection of f onto the lacunary frequencies and observe that f nj j 1 2 2 f f l log l 1 2 exp l 2 f l log l 1 2 f nj j 1 2 and this completes the proof the reader can compare this argument to 23 ch xii 7 6 concerning 3 4 we are sure that this is known but could not locate an explicit reference to it in the literature one can modify the argument in 18 to show the equivalent form of 3 4 j 1 ajwnj x p c p aj j 1 2 1 p alternatively one could show that the haar littlewood paley square function of j 1 ajwnj has l norm at most c aj j 1 2 and then appeal to the chang wilson wolff inequality see 5 proof of lemma 3 2 clearly if g f then the desired estimate follows from l 2 boundedness of the lacunary carleson operator we ll assume below that f c 0 g for some absolute constant c 0 we ll take g g m 1 f where we choose g 1 f so that g is a major subset of g furthermore we can choose c 0 small enough such that 1 and it is then not hard to see that f is supported inside m 1 f below we show that this choice of g works let i be the maximal dyadic intervals i m 1 f we then have f i i for i i and 3 5 i i i m 1 f 1 f let p be those bi tiles p with ip f and ip g it is clear that cf g bp f g we then decompose p k 0 pk using only the density lemma see lemma 2 6 thus pk is 10 yen do and michael lacey a union of trees t in collection tk so that dense pk 2 k and the estimate 2 of the density lemma holds namely energy pk t tk it 2 k g it follows from 2 11 and the first half of the estimate 2 14 that we have bpk f g g f k 1 we will use this estimate for 1 k k 0 c log log 1 which is consistent with the estimate we want to prove we begin the multi frequency part of the proof fix k k 0 for convenience we suppress the dependence on k in the following estimate of bpk f g except for pk for i i let qi be those tiles p with time interval i which as rectangles in the phase plane intersect the lower half of some bi tile p pk take any such pair p p by the construction of pk and i it follows that we must have p p the inequality between p and the lower part of p must be strict hence we must have p pu furthermore using standard properties of walsh packets it follows that wp is a scalar multiple of wp on ip we set i to be the projection of f onto the space spanned by the wave packets wp p qi and set i i i this implies that for any p pk and any i i we have f 1 i i wp 0 indeed since i is supported on i we can assume ip i then there will be an element p qi such that p p and so we can replace wp 1 i by a multiple wp and the desired equality follows since f is supported inside the union of intervals in i it then follows that we have bpk f g bpk g and our objective is to use the zygmund inequality to provide a favorable estimate for the l 2 norm of we check that the zygmund inequality applies to the tiles in qi let 1 be the lacunarity constant of the sequence nj j 1 for a tile p in this collection write the frequency interval of p as p p 1 i 1 taking a different p qi with nj p nj p we have p p nj p i 1 nj p i 1 nj p on the convergence of lacunary walsh fourier series 11 note that except for the first 1 2 1 tiles we will have nj p 1 2 1 i 1 2 1 i 1 hence after at most o 1 initial terms the sequence p p qi has lacunarity constant at least 1 2 and so the sequence has a lacunarity constant that is only dependent on we estimate as below where we will be using the zygmund inequality which requires an appropriate renormalization of the interval i i 2 f wp p qi 2 f 1 i l log l 1 2 i i 1 2 f i i log i f i 1 2 i 1 2 log 1 1 2 i 1 2 it follows from 3 5 and f g 1 that 2 log 1 1 2 m 1 f 1 2 f g 1 2 log 1 1 2 we now turn to the second half of the estimate 2 14 to see that bpk f g bpk g 2 k 2 g 2 2 k 2 f log 1 1 2 by choice of k 0 c log log g f we can sum this estimate in k k 0 to conclude the proof of the lemma 3 6 remark some of the arguments in the proof above we have learned from the last two pages of 17 and specialized to the lacunary setting 4 proof of the strong type estimate 1 6 we turn to the proof of the strong type estimate that c maps l log l log log l into l 1 the intermediate inequality we prove is this for any f 0 1 and function f dominated by f we have cf 1 f log f 1 log log f 1 4 1 the main idea of the proof is the following principle one can pass from a restricted weak type inequality together with the l 2 estimate to strong type inequality with a loss of a log term 12 yen do and michael lacey specifically by lemma 3 2 for any set g 0 1 there is a major subset g g so that for any g dominated by g 4 2 cf g f log log f 1 we apply 4 2 to the set g 0 0 1 getting major subset g 0 and then recursively apply the inequality to g 1 g 0 g 0 after a number t 0 of steps we will have gt 0 f at which point we stop the recursion and set g t 0 gt 0 it is not hard to see that we can take t 0 2 log 2 f 1 now for appropriately chosen functions gt dominated by g t for 0 t t 0 we have cf 1 t 0 t 0 cf gt t 0 t 0 f log log f 1 f log f 1 log log f 1 we use 4 2 for 0 t t 0 and for the last term we simply use the l 2 inequality for cf to conclude the inequality 1 6 from the intermediate 4 1 one relies upon the fact that an arbitrary l log l log log l is a convex combination of functions of the form f f log f 1 log log f 1 1 where f is dominated by f we omit the straight forward proof of this fact the reader should be well aware that the same comments do not hold for the weak type estimate which is the focus of the next section 5 a sj lin type distributional estimate much of the remaining arguments needed to conclude the weak type estimate 1 5 are derived from observations brought to bear on the question of the convergence of the fourier sums along the full sequence here and in the remainder of the paper we let cfullf supn 1 snf the estimate of sj lin 19 is cfull 1 f t f t log t f f 0 1 t 0 on the convergence of lacunary walsh fourier series 13 we denote the decreasing rearrangement invariant function h of function h by 5 1 h t inf s 0 x h x s t our purpose here is to establish the lacunary version of this inequality and then use an observation of antonov 1 to obtain a particular extension of this result 5 2 lemma for any t 0 and any f majorized by f 0 1 we have clacf t f t log log t f f 0 1 t 0 here and below we set clacf supj 1 snjf proof for any s 0 let gs cf x s by lemma 3 2 there exists a major set g s such that for appropriate g majorized by g s we have s gs 2 s g s cf g f log log gs f or equivalently s f gs log log gs f therefore if s c f t log log t f for some large absolute constant c we ll have f t log log t f f gs log log gs f so by the strictly increasing property of s log log 1 s we obtain f t f gs or equivalently gs t this completes the proof of the lemma now we will use a key observation of antonov 1 to remove the restricted type assumption in lemma 5 2 unlike previous lemmas where the bi tiles in the definition of c could be arbi trary in the following lemma and hence subsequent lemmas we need to know that c is the actual discretization of the lacunary maximal carleson operator used in the lemma above the observation of antonov is the following lemma 5 3 lemma for m n set smf sup 1 n m snf for every 0 and function 0 f 1 supported in 0 1 there is a set f 0 1 with f 1 f and moreover sm f 1 f a proof of antonov s lemma in the walsh fourier setting could be found in sj lin soria 20 using antonov s observation have there holds the following for any t 0 we have clacf t f 1 t log log t f 1 0 f 1 5 4 14 yen do and michael lacey cfullf t f 1 t log t f 1 0 f 1 5 5 6 proof of the weak type estimate 1 5 antonov 1 used 5 5 to derive his conclusion that cfull maps l log l log log log l into l 1 which remains the best known result for the full sequence of integers his argument was fur ther generalized by arias de reyna 2 which language was phrased in that of interpolation and extrapolation theory the latter approach has been revisited by others with the relevant point for us that the starting point is the distributional inequality 5 5 or more generally something of the broad form of 5 5 or 5 4 in our setting we are fortunate that the investigations of carro martin 4 are nicely suited to derive our weak type estimate we will be a little brief about this as the theorems of carro martin apply in an uncomplicated fashion the extrapolation theory of carro mart n starts with a sublinear operator t such that for any f l 1 l 0 1 with f 1 we have using the notation of 5 1 tf t d f 1 r t 6 1 then under mild assumptions on d and r carro and martin shows that t is bounded from a logarithmic type space qd to a weighted lorentz space mr for convenience we shall refer to those functions f l 1 l 0 1 with f 1 as atoms 6 2 definition let d 0 0 be a concave function such that d 0 0 then qd is the space of functions f such that there exists a decomposition of f f k akfk ak 0 where fk are atoms and a scalar partition of unity k bk 1 with bk 0 such that the following sum is finite k akd fk 1 1 log 1 bk the infimum of all such sums is denoted by f qd 6 3 definition let r 0 0 then mr is the space of functions f such that f mr sup t 0 f t r t in particular when r t 1 t the space mr becomes the usual l 1 on the convergence of lacunary walsh fourier series 15 in the following theorems extracted from 4 we assume that d r are respectively eligible for the above definitions 6 4 theorem 4 theorem 2 1 assume that t is a sublinear operator such that for any atomic f and any t 0 we have tf t d f 1 r t assume that tr t is a nondecreasing function then t is bounded from qd to mr next the space qd and orlicz spaces are related 6 5 definition letd 0 0 be a concave increasing function such thatd 0 0 then l log log log l d is the space of functions f such that f l log log log l d 1 0 f t log log log 1 t dd t 6 6 theorem 4 theorem 2 2 3 assume d is also increasing if d s s for any s 0 and d s 2 sd s for any 0 s 1 then l log log log l d qd 6 1 proof of the weak type estimate 1 5 in our case we ll have 6 1 with d s s log log 1 s r t 1 t to see this note that this follows from 5 4 if t 1 when t 1 using the trivial bound cf x s 1 which holds for any s since cf is supported in 0 1 we obtain cf t 0 and the factorization estimate 6 1 follows immediately we note that technically the above function d s is not concave for some range of s near 1 so what really happens is we use a concave approximation of d that is comparable up to the first derivative to d near these values of s we will abuse notation and use d in the sequel without any further comment now the extrapolation method of carro mart n will give the following estimate cf 1 1 0 f t log log log 1 t d t dt 1 0 f t log log 1 t log log log 1 t dt f l log log l log log log l 16 yen do and michael lacey note that the last equivalence is a known equivalent way to express the orlicz norm as it is classi cal that we have snjf f a e for bounded functions which are dense in l log log l log log log l this proves the a e convergence for all f in this space 7 concluding remarks for a lacunary sequence of integers nj there is a direct way to see that snjf converges to f a e for f l log l 1 2 we indicate this here letting vnf denote the de la vall e poussin sums we of course have vnf converging a e to f and one can see that the inequality below j vnjf snjf 2 1 2 1 f l log l 1 2 is a corollary to the endpoint marcinkiewicz multiplier theorem of tao wright 21 this paper has interesting variants of the zygmund inequality if we consider the full sequence of partial walsh fourier sums we have no better estimate than hausdorff young to use in the multi frequency argument we have not seen an estimate that would improve our knowledge of the convergence of the full sequence of walsh fourier sums indeed if we consider any sequence that grows more slowly than lacunary it would seem that only the hausdorff young inequality is available in the multi frequency argument konyagin has showed that for special sequences of indices the corresponding partial sums of the walsh paley series converge almost everywhere to f for any f l 1 t 10 these are sequences of indices such that if we write each index in binary form then there there is an uniform bound on the number of times the digits alternate between 0 and 1 in particular the sequence of powers of 2 falls into this category although it is not hard to construct a lacunary sequence of integers without this property he has posed the question of characterizing those sequence of integers nj for which the walsh fourier series snjf converge pointwise to f for all integrable f see 12 problem 3 3 there are more points of interest in this paper the interested reader is
