brownian motion deniz karl abstract in this paper we consider a product of a symmetric stable process in rd and a one dimensional brownian motion in r then we define a class of harmonic functions with respect to this product process we show that bounded non negative harmonic functions in the upper half space satisfy harnack inequality and prove that they are locally ho lder continuous we also argue a result on littlewood paley functions which are obtained by the harmonic extension of an lp rd function keywords harnack inequality symmetric stable process regularity dirichlet problem littlewood paley functions mathematics subject classification 2000 60 42 1 introduction in the last 20 years there has been an increasing interest in non continuous stochastic processes in particular symmetric stable processes play an impor tant role in today s probability theory and there has been a remarkable increase in the number of applications of symmetric stable processes in this paper we focus on a product process xt which is the product of a d dimensional symmetric stable process and a one dimensional brownian motion we define harmonic functions with respect to this process in a probabilistic way and then study its applications the organization of this paper is as follows one of the most fundamental tools about harmonic functions is the harnack in equality in section 3 we prove a harnack inequality for harmonic functions in r d r first we show that the hitting probability of a borel set with positive measure is positive then we prove the harnack inequality using krylov safonov s approach 6 in section 4 we study regularity of these harmonic functions and deniz karli department of mathematics the university of british columbia 1984 mathematics road vancouver b c canada v 6 t 1 z 2 e mail deniz karli math ubc ca http arxiv org abs 1010 4904 v 2 2 deniz karl prove their ho lder continuity one of the ways to obtain an harmonic function is to extend a function on rd which can be taken as the boundary of rd r this is also known as the dirichlet problem for the upper half space we define the solution of this problem by means of the semigroup corresponding to xt then in the last section we state some results on littlewood paley functions studied by p a meyer and n varopoulos and then prove a result on a partial littlewood paley function by using harnack inequality 2 preliminaries in this section we give the details of the setup and introduce the notation which will be used for the rest of the paper we consider the space rd with d dimensional lebesgue measure m and the upper half space rd r as a subspace of rd 1 for simplicity we identify the boundary of the upper half plane rd 0 with rd we will denote the product measure m a by ma for a r where a is point mass at a throughout the paper c c 1 c 2 will denote constants their values may vary from line to line now we introduce our process in details let yt denote a d dimensional right continuous symmetric stable process that is yt is a right continuous markov process with independent and stationary increments and its characteristic func tion is e t it is known that yt satisfies the scaling property with the factor of t 1 that is the processes yct y 0 and c 1 yt y 0 have the same distri bution for any c 0 let pt denote the semigroup corresponding to yt that is pt f x e x f yt here p x is a probability measure corresponding yt started at the point x and ex is the expectation with respect to px it is known that the measure px yt dy is absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue measure we will denote transition densities of this symmetric stable process by p t x y unlike brownian motion there isn t any simple explicit formula for the transition densities however we will use the following estimate on p t x y c 1 s d s x y d p s x y c 2 s d s x y d 1 for some positive constants c 1 and c 2 moreover by 11 p 261 p s 0 x can also be expressed as 0 4 u d 2 e x 2 4 u g 2 s u du 2 where g 2 s u is the density of an 2 stable subordinator whose laplace trans form is given by 0 e vg 2 s v dv e s 2 hence p s 0 x is continuous and differentiable in the variable x this stable process yt forms the horizontal component of our product process if we think rd as the horizontal and r as the vertical component of rd r on the vertical direction we let zt be a one dimensional brownian motion which harnack inequalitiy 3 is independent from yt and so the product process is xt yt zt we define the stopping time t 0 inf t 0 zt 0 which is the first time xt hits the boundary which is rd 0 we note that t 0 depends only on zt by independence of yt and zt in the classical context the definition of a harmonic function can be given in both analytic and probabilistic way we adopt the probabilistic definition and mod ify it to define harmonic functions in this paper we call a continuous function u x t on rd r harmonic harmonic if the process u xt t 0 is a martingale with respect to the filtration fs xr t 0 r s and the probability measure p x t for any starting point x t rd r one natural way to obtain such a harmonic function is to start with a bounded borel function f on rd and extend it to the upper half space one can write this extension by e x t f yt 0 0 e x f ys p t t 0 ds x t rd r 3 here pt t 0 ds is the exit distribution of brownian motion and its explicit form is well known it is the probability measure t ds where t ds t 2 e t 2 4 s s 3 2 ds 4 see 7 on the other hand exf ys can be written as ps f x f y p s x y dy we note that this extension 3 is a continuous function of x t by 4 and 2 for simplicity let s denote this extension by f as well and write ft x f x t e x t f yt 0 for t 0 and f x 0 f x if we consider the process m f t f xt t 0 and the filtration fs xr t 0 r s then it is easy to see that m f t is a martingale under the probability measure p x t for any x and for any t 0 with respect to the given filtration so the extension is a harmonic function this harmonic extension can also be expressed as a convolution f x t f qt x where qt x 0 p s x 0 t ds if we define qt by qt 0 ps t ds then we can see that the extension of f is f x t qt f x we note that qt satisfies semi group properties in section 5 the main idea is based on the relation between a deterministic integral and a probabilistic integral for the conversion between these two integral we will use two tools namely the green function of brownian motion and le vy system formula for the jump terms if f is a positive borel function then the green function for brownian motion is given by e a t 0 0 f zs ds 0 z a f z dz for any a r the second tool the le vy system formula can be stated as follows theorem 1 suppose f is a positive measurable function on rd rd if f x y is zero on the diagonal then e x s t f ys ys ex t 0 f ys ys u du u d ds 4 deniz karl for any x rd for the proof we refer to the paper 3 this property will be called as the le vy system formula throughout the rest of this paper now let l be the infinitesimal generator of the symmetric stable process yt on its domain d l which is defined as limt 0 pt i t it can be given explicitly by lf x f x h f x 1 i h 1 f x h c h d dh 1 section 3 3 we know that the semi group pt admits a square operator which is given by the relation 2 f g l fg fl g gl f if we denote the point evaluation of f g at x by x f g then we have the following proposition proposition 1 if f is a bounded function in d l and ft x qtf x as defined above then x ft ft c ft x h ft x 2 h d dh proof according to the paper 7 lemma 5 on p 153 ft is in d l moreover again by 7 theorem 2 on p 147 f 2 t is also in d l since the map x x 2 is in c 2 by definition 2 ft ft l f 2 t 2 ftl ft now we need to consider two cases where 2 1 and 1 0 separately in the first case we have ft x l ft x ft x ft x h f 2 t x 1 i h 1 ft x ft x h c h d dh and l f 2 t x f 2 t x h f 2 t x 1 i h 1 f 2 t x h c h d dh so 2 x ft ft ft x h ft x 2 c h d dh 1 i h 1 h 2 ft x ft x f 2 t x c h d dh since f 2 t 2 ft ft the second term is zero hence the result follows in the second case where 1 0 we can drop the last term of the integrand of the generator since the integral 1 i h 1 h h d dh is zero then a similar calculation yields to the desired result harnack inequalitiy 5 by meyer 7 p 158 the quadratic variation of the martingale m f t is mf t 2 t t 0 0 g ys zs ds 5 where g x t x ft ft t f x t 2 and x ft ft is as given above this function appear in section 5 when we construct littlewood paley functions before we end this section let s list some short remarks which will be useful later remark 1 if m is lebesgue measure let pma be the measure defined by p ma p x a m dx and e ma the integral taken with respect to the measure pma remark 2 the law of xt 0 under the measure p ma is m remark 3 the semi groups pt and qt are invariant under integration with respect to lebesgue measure if f is a bounded borel function then pt f x m dx f x m dx qt f x m dx 3 harnack inequality when one study harmonic functions on a domain one of the most useful tools in harmonic analysis is the harnack inequality it allows us to compare values of a harmonic function inside a domain and it plays a crucial role for many applications in this section our main goal is to obtain a harnack inequality theorem 3 in this setup which was described in the previous section to prove the inequality we follow krylov safonov approach see 6 and the method used by bass levin in 3 the idea is based on the fact that the hitting probability of a borel set with positive measure is non zero so we focus on hitting probability first let s start by introducing the notation to be used in this section since we have different scaling factors in vertical and horizontal directions we will consider the rectangular box dr x t dr x br t where dr x y rd xi yi r 2 2 i 1 d x x 1 xd and br t s r s t r 2 for 0 1 we define the box with margin by d r x t d r x b 1 r t where d r x y rd xi yi 1 2 r 2 2 i 1 d x x 1 xd 6 deniz karl we denote the first hitting time and first exit time of a borel set a by ta and a respectively if a is a point set then we will use tx instead of t x first we observe that expected exit time from the box dr x t is comparable to r 2 lemma 1 let 0 there exists a positive constant c such that e y s dr x t c r 2 for y s d r x t and d 2 r x t rd r proof let u 0 then using the independence of yv and zv first and the scaling property second we obtain e y s dr x t e y s dr x t dr x t 2 r 2 u 2 r 2 up y s dr x t 2 r 2 u 2 r 2 up y s sup v 2 r 2 u yv y 0 2 r 2 2 sup v 2 r 2 u zv z 0 r 2 2 r 2 up y sup v 2 r 2 u yv y 0 2 r 2 2 p s sup v 2 r 2 u zv z 0 r 2 2 r 2 up 0 sup v u yv 1 2 p 0 sup v u zv 1 2 if we choose u small enough then the last two probabilities above can be made bigger than 1 2 then the result follows lemma 2 there exists a positive constant c such that e y s dr x t c r 2 for any y s dr x t and d 2 r x t rd r proof by scaling we may consider the case r 1 and so it is enough to show that e y s d 1 x t c where d 2 x t r d r let s be the first time when yv jumps of size larger than two if we use the le vy system formula p y s s 1 e y s v s 1 1 i yv yv 2 e y s s 1 0 h 2 dh h d dv h 2 dh h d e y s s 1 ce y s s 1 s 1 cp y s s 1 c 1 p y s s 1 hence there is c 0 1 such that p y s s 1 c and thus p y s s 1 1 c we note that d 1 x t is smaller than s thus p y s d 1 x t 1 1 c harnack inequalitiy 7 let s denote the usual shift operator by m by the markov property p y s d 1 x t m 1 p y s d 1 x t m d 1 x t m 1 e y s p y s d 1 x t m 1 fm d 1 x t m e y s p xm d 1 x t 1 d 1 x t m 1 c p y s d 1 x t m then we obtain p y s d 1 x t m 1 c m by induction this leads to e y s d 1 x t 1 m 1 p y s d 1 x t m c before we prove our theorem on hitting probabilities for general borel sets we consider the simple sets which are the boxes of the form e a b rd r theorem 2 suppose y s d 2 x t and k e a b is a rectangular box in d 1 x t such that e rd then p y s tk d 3 x t c m e b a for some positive constant c and d 6 x t rd r proof first using the levy system formula we obtain p y s tk d 3 x t e y s v d 3 x t 1 i zv a b 1 i yv 6 yv yv e e y s d 3 x t 0 1 i zv a b e dz yv z d dv cm e e y s d 3 x t 0 1 i zv a b dv to verify the last inequality notice that yv z is bounded above for any z e under p y s next we will show e y s d 3 x t 0 1 i zv a b dv c b a in this proof we will use 1 a and t 1 a for the first exit time and the first hitting time of a borel set a rd by symmetric stable process yt respectively similarly 2 a and t 2 a denote the first exit time and the first hitting time of a borel set a r by brownian motion zt respectively if a r is a point set then we will use the notation t 2 u t 2 u first we note that d 3 x t 1 d 3 x 2 b 3 t 1 d 3 x 2 t 3 2 t 3 2 set c 32 22 2 then c inf v 0 yv y 0 c 1 d 3 x 8 deniz karl under p y s since we have y d 2 x hence e y s d 3 x t 0 1 i zv a b dv e y s c 3 0 1 i zv a b dv where 3 t 2 t 3 2 t

we note that h t 3 2 h s b a t 3 2 b s b a since a b t 1 2 t 1 2 finally by translation invariance of brownian motion p 0 t 1 t 2 t 3 2 t 2 t 3 2 c p 0 1 t 2 7 2 t 2 1 2 c and so e 0 s c 3 0 1 i zv a

symmetry and the last term is bounded below by c a b c b a for the last case assume s a b we use the same function h x as in the case s a arguing as in the case s a e y s d 3 x t 0 1 i zv a b dv e 0 s

d 3 x t 0 1 i zv a b dv c b a so we proved the hitting probability of a rectangular box is positive we can extend this to any compact set in d 1 x t using krylov safonov s method which is based on covering the compact set with rectangular boxes from here on we denote the lebesgue measure of a set a in rd r by a corollary 1 there exists a non decreasing function 0 1 0 1 such that if a is a compact set inside d 1 x t such that a 0 and y s d 2 x t then p y s ta d 3 x t a where d 6 x t rd r proof first define inf p z u tb d 3 z 0 u 0 z 0 u 0 r d r z u d 2 z 0 u 0 6 b d 1 z 0 u 0 b d 1 z 0

find q such that q q 2 2 q 0 q let q q 2 2 so that q q q 2 2 let 0 which will be chosen later there is d 6 z 0 u 0 rd r z u d 2 z 0 u 0 and b d 1 z 0 u 0 such that q b d 1 z 0 u 0 q 7 and p z u tb d 3 z 0 u 0 q 2 8 without loss of generality we may drop z 0 u 0 and denote di z 0 u 0 by di for i 1 2 3 now we construct the rectangular region d which is described in the proposition 2 7 2 since b d 1 and q b d 1 b there exists a rectangular region d which satisfies the following conditions 10 deniz karl 1 d ir i where ri is a cube and r i denotes the cube with the same center as ri but side

have fi b q fi and if z u fi then p z u tfi b f i q by the definition of if z u d then z u r i d 1 for some ri we can find a cube k rd and k c d fi by the theorem 2 there is such that p z u tfi d 3 p

this completes the proof harnack inequalitiy 11 lemma 3 suppose h is a function which is bounded non negative on rd r and supported in d 2 r x t c where d 4 r x t rd r if y s y s d r x t then e y s h x dr x t ce y s h x dr x t proof it suffices to prove the statement for h 1 if with f d 2 r x t c since zv is continuous h x dr is non zero if and only if y jumps from dr x t into d 2 r x t c since dr x t dr x br t it is enough to consider the sets f e c d with c d br t and the function h of the form h 1 if then e y s 1 ie c d xu dr x t e y s v u dr x t 1 i yv 6 yv yv e e y s u dr x t 0 e dh h yv d

e dh h x d observe that the above inequality also holds under p y s hence the result fol lows so far we have showed that any compact set with a positive measure is visited by xt with positive probability given that the starting point is close to prove the harnack inequality we will use this fact by defining a compact set on which the harmonic function takes large values since this set is visited with positive probability one can define a sequence on which the function is unbounded to simplify our notation we fix a point temporarily and we will denote the usual rectangular box around this center by d r 12 deniz karl theorem 3 there exists c 0 such that if h is non negative and bounded on r d r harmonic in d 16 and d 32 rd r then h y t c h y t y t y t d 1 proof by taking a constant multiple of h we may assume that inf d 1 h 1 2 then there is y 0 t 0 d 1 such that h y 0 t 0 1 we will show that h is bounded above in d 1 by a constant not depending on h we show that if h takes a very large value in d 1 then we can find a sequence in d 2 for which h is unbounded let x s d 1 such that h x s k k will be chosen later and we can take k large let 0 be small by the lemma 3 there is c 2 such that if x s r d r r 0 dr denotes the rectangular boxdr x s about the center x s d r denotes the rectangular box with margin d r x s h is bounded non negative and supported in dc 2 r then for any y t y t d r e y t h x dr c 2 e y t h x dr 11 by theorem 2 p y 0 t 0 td 2 r 3 d 16 c 3 d 2 r 3 12 by corollary 1 there is c 4 such that if c dr 3 is a compact set with c dr 3 1 3 then p y t tc dr c

keep r small that is r 1 32 and so the rectangular boxes stay in the upper half space let a u v dr 3 h u v k we claim that a dr 3 1 2 if not then there is a compact subset a such that a dr 3 1 3 then

m k 1 p x s tc dr 1 p x s tc dr 1 then there is a 0 such that m 1 2 k and as a result there is x s d 2 r such that h x s 1 k now suppose there is x 1 s 1 d 1 with h x 1 s 1 k 1 we can then find r 1 as above and there is x 2 s 2 d 2 r 1 x 1 s 1 with h x 2 s 2 k 2 1 k 1 by induction we can create a sequence xi si and corresponding ki ri so that xi 1 si 1 d 2 ri xi si and ki 1 i 1 k 1 note that i xi 1

techniques to prove ho lder continuity and regularity results of some integral operators they applied these techniques in the case of a jump markov process whose kernel is comparable to that of a symmetric stable process we will follow their method and show regularity results for our resolvent we call the operator u f x t e x t 0 e s f xs ds 0 e s qsf x t ds as the resolvent of f resolvent plays an important role in applications we study some properties of this resolvent theorem 4 if f is a bounded function on rd r and it is harmonic on d 4 x t r d r then f is ho lder continuous in d 1

ek log e 2 log log y s y s log y s y s where 2 log log this is the desired result having the ho lder continuity of harmonic function we can discuss the conti nuity of the resolvent as we defined before resolvent of f is given by u f x t e x t 0 e s f xs ds harnack inequalitiy 17 we will show that u f y s u f y s c f y s y s 1 20 first we recall the resolvent equation u u u u 21 it is easy to verify this equation due to the semi group property of qs this resolvent inequality reduces 20 to the case 0 so we will prove the following theorem first and then we prove 20 by using this theorem theorem 5 suppose f is a bounded function on rd r with compact support then there exists 0 1 such that u 0 f y s u 0 f y s c f u 0 f y s y s 1 proof first of all without loss of generality we may assume d 4 y s rd r by scaling property we observe that if y s y s 1 the result follows immediately so we assume y s y s 1 that is y s d 1 y s by definition u 0 f y s e y s 0 f xt dt which can be written as u 0 f y s e y s dr y s 0 f xt dt e y s dr y s f xt dt r 1 will be chosen later we only assume r 1 by strong markov property the second term is equal to e y s 0 f xt dr y s dt e y s e y s 0 f xt dr y s dt dr y s e y s u 0 f x dr y s similarly u 0 f y s e y s dr y s 0 f xt dt e y s u 0 f x dr y s hence u 0 f y s u 0 f y s f e y s dr y s e y s dr y s e y s u 0 f x dr y s e y s u 0 f x dr y s note that the first term is bounded by c r 2 f we also note that the function z u e z u u 0 f x dr y s is harmonic in dr y s so it is ho lder continuous by previous theorem then the second term on the right is bounded by c u 0 f y s y s r r 2 18 deniz karl after scaling now let r y s y s 4 since y s y s 1 we have y s y s 1 2 y s y s 4 and hence u 0 f y s u 0 f y s c f y s y s 2 c u 0 f y s y s 2 c f u 0 f y s y s 2 theorem 6 suppose f is bounded and 0 then we have u f y s u f y s c f y s y s 1 proof it is enough to show this for positive and compactly supported functions suppose f 0 and f has compact support define the function g by g y s f y s u f y s 22 note that u 0 u f u 0 f u f by resolvent equation 21 and hence u 0 g u 0 f u 0 u f u f these equations can be verified by direct calculation using this equality we obtain u 0 g u f c f and g f u f c f finally by previous theorem u f y s u f y s u 0 g y s u 0 g y s c g u 0 g 1 y s y s c f 1 y s y s 5 littlewood paley functions this short section is about littlewood paley functions obtained from the harmonic extension of a function f on rd after defining g functions in this context we state some earlier results by p a meyer 7 8 9 and n varopoulos 12 and then we prove a result on a partial g function which is close to the area functional used in the classical context let s denote the general littlewood paley function by gf and define it by gf x 0 t g x t dt 1 2 0 t ft x h ft x 2 h d dh dt 0 t t f x t 2 dt 1 2 harnack inequalitiy 19 where ft x qtf x as defined in the section of preliminaries as one can easily see the integrand g x t is the square function which was defined before in 5 it has two components one corresponding to the vertical process brownian motion and the other one corresponding to the horizontal process symmetric stable process let s denote these components by g f and gf respectively explicitly these two functions are gf x 0 t ft x h ft x 2 h d dh dt 1 2 and g f x 0 t t f x t 2 dt 1 2 some results on lp norms of these g functions are known p a meyer worked in 8 with symmetric markov processes and proved an lp inequality for the case p 2 when applied to our setup we can state it as gf p c f p for p 2 on the other hand n varopoulos showed in his work 12 that this inequality can be extended to p 1 for the brownian component that is g f p c f p for p 1 however the extension of this inequality for the general g function is not possible which is pointed by m silverstein 10 here we discuss the part of the horizontal component on a parabolic like domain although the extension of this lp inequality is not true for gf when p 1 2 we can obtain a partial result considering the operator only inside a parabolic like domain in the classical context the area functional is defined in a similar way on a cone with a vertex at a point x rd since we have different scaling factors on each component we consider a modification of this domain and study the part of g function on the set x h t rd r h t 2 for this purpose define gf as gf x 0 t h t 2 ft x h ft x 2 dh h d dt 1 2 first we note that the harmonic extension can be expressed as a convolution of the function with an approximate identity to see this we observe that transi tion densities of the symmetric stable process yt satisfy the relation p st 2 0 y t 2 d p s 0 yt 2 by the scaling property hence we can write ft x f x y t y dy f t x where x 0 p s 0 x 1 ds and t x t 2 d x t 2 so ft x cm f x 4 section 2 1 where m f is the hardy littlewood max imal function to see this it is enough to note that is radially decreasing and its l 1 norm equals one since the transition density p s 0 x is obtained from the 20 deniz karl characteristic function e s x by the inverse fourier transform it follows trivially that p s 0 x is a radial symmetric function moreover by 11 p 261 p s 0 x can also be expressed as 0 4 u d 2 e x 2 4 u g 2 s u du where g 2 s u is the density of an 2 stable subordinator whose laplace transform is given by 0 e vg 2 s v dv e s 2 hence p s 0 x is radially decreasing in the vari able x the fact that is radially decreasing follows from the previous line it is also known that m f p c f p when f lp and p 1 lemma 4 if f lp then for some x h t between ft x and ft x h f pp c 0 t p 2 f x h ft x 2 dh h d dt dx proof suppose f is positive and consider the map f x x p for some 0 clearly f c 2 r so we can apply the ito formula using the martingale m f t f xt t 0 and we obtain m f t p m f 0 p p t 0 m f s p 1 dm f s p p 1 2 t 0 m f s p 2 d mf c s s t m f s p mfs p p mfs p 1 m f s mfs by 7 p 168 there is a positive function j s such that d mf c s j s ds and hence the third term on the right hand side is positive moreover the convexity of the function f implies that the jump terms are also positive so taking expectations first and letting t and 0 we have e ma m f t 0 p ema s t 0 m f s p mfs p p mfs p 1 m f s mfs we recall that f pp ema mft 0 p remarks 1 and 2 if we denote by f x y z the expression f x y z f p x z fp y z pfp 1 y z f x z f y z then we can write f pp ema s t 0 f ys ys zs next we will use the le vy system formula invariance of pt under the lebesgue measure m and green s function respectively and the right hand side of the last harnack inequalitiy 21 inequality becomes e ma t 0 0 f ys h ys zs dh h d ds e a t 0 0 f y h y zs dh h d ds dy 0 a t f y h y t dh h d dt dy if we let a then f pp 0 t f y h y t dh h d dt dy if we use the taylor expansion of x xp then for some between ft x and ft x h we have f y h y t p p 1 2 p 2 ft y h ft y 2 and using this equality we obtain the result f pp c 0 t p 2 f x h ft x 2 dh h d dt dx theorem 7 if p 1 2 and f lp rd then gf p c f p proof without loss of generality we may assume that f 0 then it can be generalized to f lp by definition of the harmonic extension we also have ft by lemma 4 there is t h x between ft x and ft x h such that f pp c 0 t p 2 f x h ft x 2 dh h d dt dx using this we can write gf x 0 t h t 2 ft x h ft x 2 dh h d dt 1 2 0 t h t 2 2 p p 2 ft x h ft x 2 dh h d dt 1 2 temporarily we fix t 0 let rt be the rectangular box centered at x t with side length t 32 2 t 32 2 t 32 2 t 32 that is rt dt 32 x t then r 32 t r d r let x h t denotes the linear path from x t to x h t where h t 2 this path can be covered by n many horizontal translations of the box rt 22 deniz karl say r 1 t r 2 t r n t such that r j t r j 1 t 6 for j 1 2 n 1 and rt r 1 t 6 note that n can be chosen so that it does not depend on t x or h choose points from each pairwise intersection say x 1 t rt r 1 t x 2 t r 1 t r 2 t xn t rn 1 t rnt by using the harnack inequality we obtain ft x h c ft xn c 2 ft xn 1 cnft x 1 cn 1 ft x hence if h t 2 then ft x h cn 1 ft x and ft x ft x h cn 1 ft x this implies that 2 p c f 2 pt x c m f x 2 p so gf x
