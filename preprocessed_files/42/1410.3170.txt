wiener spaces riesz bases frames vector valued gabor system 2010 msc 41 42 1 introduction the main goal of this paper is to develop a correspondence between exponential basis on a domain in the euclidean space and translation bases for paley wiener spaces let be a borel subset of rd d 1 with positive and finite measure we define the paley wiener space pw r d on domain to be the subspace of all l 2 rd functions f whose fourier transform are supported in more precisely pw r d f l 2 rd f 0 for a e c for f pw r d we say f is nowhere zero on if f 6 0 for all given a countable set a in rd and l 2 rd we say the system of translates a a a is a riesz basis for pw r d if there exist positive and finite numbers c 1 c 2 such that for any f pw r d there is ca a a l 2 a such that f x a a ca x a and c 1 a a ca 2 f 2 2 c 2 a a ca 2 1 1 1 this research was partially supported by psc cuny grant 67736 0045 preprint submitted to elsevier october 14 2014 http arxiv org abs 1410 3170 v 1 in this case the constants c 1 and c 2 are called riesz constants for the rest of this paper we denote by a a countable set in rd and by a borel set of positive and finite measure and by we mean the fourier transform of defined as usual by e 2 ix x dx we say set a is a riesz basis spectrum for l 2 if there exist positive and finite constants c 1 c 2 such that for any f l 2 there is ca a a l 2 a such that f a a caea and c 1 a a ca 2 f 2 l 2 c 2 a a ca 2 1 2 here ea x e 2 i x a a a x and x a is the inner product in rn in this case we call a riesz basis spectral set analogously we say a is an orthonormal basis spectrum and is orthonormal basis spectral set if ea a a is an orthonormal basis for l 2 see the seminal paper by fuglede 14 for background on orthonormal exponential bases in many problems in harmonic analysis approximation theory wavelet theory sam pling theory gabor systems and signal processing 4 2 16 23 24 25 it is interesting to construct a function l 2 rd such that the set a a is an orthonormal or a riesz sequence the structure of for which j j zd is an orthonormal basis or riesz basis for the closure of its spanned space in l 2 rd topology has been extensively studied in for example 4 5 17 6 the techniques used in these papers strongly rely on the periodic tiling property of 0 1 d for rd in general the same techniques can not be used for the characterization of general translates of when zd and 0 1 d are replaced by any countable set a and any borel set respectively in this paper we extend the results of the characterization of translate bases where a does not necessarily have a group structure in our paper we shall focus our attention only on the class of paley wiener functions pw r d this paper is structured as follows the first main result is stated in theorem 1 3 in section 1 in section 2 we prove theorem 1 3 and we establish a correspondence between bases of the type a a a in l 2 rd and spectrum a for moreover we prove that under some mild assumptions on the necessary and sufficient conditions for a a a to be a riesz basis for pw r d is that a is a riesz basis spectrum for in section 3 we extend the results of section 2 to general bases i e frames in section 4 we use our 2 results to characterize the structure of paley wiener valued gabor systems in particular we use the result of theorem 1 3 on the characterization of exponential functions in the proof of theorem 4 3 thus illustrating the connection between vector valued gabor frames and exponential bases we shall recall the following result about the orthonormal bases of exponentials on a domain theorem 1 1 let 1 for l 2 rd the system a a a is an orthonormal basis for pw r d if and only if ea a a is an orthonormal basis for l 2 provided that x for a e x note that by the above theorem we can recover the whittaker shannon kotel nikov theorem which states that the sequence sinc x n sin x n x n n z is an orthonormal basis for pw 1 2 1 2 r the space of all functions in l 2 r with fourier support in 1 2 1 2 the following result proved by lagarias reed and wang 21 and independently by a iosevich and s pederson 18 characterizes all orthonormal basis spectrum a for d dimensional cube qd 0 1 d their results are equivalent to those in theorem 1 1 when is the cube theorem 1 2 18 let a be a subset of rd then a is an orthonormal basis spectrum for the d dimensional unite cube qd if and only if a is a tiling set for the cube qd for a function u we let u and u 0 denote the supremum and infinitum of u on respectively our next result can be viewed as a general version of theorem 1 1 theorem 1 3 let pw r d and 0 0 then x a a a is riesz basis for pw r d if and only if ea a a is riesz basis for l 2 in this case the associated reisz constants for ea a a and x a a a are equal and c 1 0 and c 2 as a consequence of theorem 1 3 we have the following results corollary 1 4 let pw r d such that is continuous and nowhere zero on if is compact then x a a a is riesz basis for pw r d if and only if ea a a is riesz basis for l 2 corollary 1 5 let a be a riesz spectrum for then for any u l 2 the set uea a is a riesz basis for l 2 if and only if 0 u 0 u 3 2 proofs of theorems 1 1 and 1 3 proof of theorem 1 1 the proof is straightforward but we write it down for the sake of completeness assume that ea is an orthonormal basis for l 2 let pw r d such that x 1 a e x we prove that la is an orthonormal basis for pw r d by the parseval identity the orthogonality of a is obtained by the orthogonality of ea and that 1 on a a ea ea a a 2 1 here is kronecker delta let f be a function in pw r d then f l 2 and hence f a f ea ea a f ea ea by the inverse fourier transform and the parseval identity we have f a f la la conversely assume that la is an onb for pw r d again the orthogonality of ea is obtained from the relation 2 1 let u l 2 then for u the inverse fourier transform of u we have u a u la la hence by the fourier transform u a u ea ea as desired for a compact and symmetric convex domain in the plane in 19 the first author with katz and tao proved that a set a is an orthonormal basis spectrum for if and only if tiles r 2 by translations as corollary of their result along theorem 1 1 in the following corollary we illustrate the relation between orthonormal translation bases and tiling property in r 2 corollary 2 1 let be any compact convex domain in the plane and a be a set in r 2 then for any pw r d with fourier transform support in the system of translations a a is orthonormal and complete in pw r 2 if and only if a is a tiling set for provided that 1 and a e 4 proof of theorem 1 3 assume that a is a riesz spectrum for and c 1 and c 2 are the associated riesz constants let pw r d for which 0 0 and let f pw r d then put u f u is in l 2 and for some ca a a l 2 a u a a caea such that c 1 a ca 2 u 2 l 2 c 2 a ca 2 2 2 we will show that f x a ca x a in l 2 rd and the inequality 1 1 holds for some other constants 0 c 1 c 2 we proceed as following let b be a finite subset of a then f a b ca a 2 pw r d f a b caea 2 l 2 f x a b ca x ea x 2 dx x u x a b caea x 2 dx 2 u a b caea 2 since the above inequality holds for any finite subset of a and since u a a caea then f a a cala holds it remains to show that the inequality 1 1 holds for f note that f 2 f 2 u 2 therefore by the upper estimation in 2 2 we will have f 2 2 u 2 c 2 2 a ca 2 with a similar argument one can show that f 2 c 1 2 0 a ca 2 consequently we have 5 c 1 a ca 2 f 2 c 2 a ca 2 for c 1 c 1 2 0 and c 2 c 2 2 conversely suppose that a a a is a riesz basis for pw r d with constants m m 0 we prove that ea a a is a riesz basis for l 2 let u l 2 and define f u here u is the fourier inverse function of u the fourier transform f has support in and by the assumptions we have f a ca x for some ca a a l 2 a such that m a ca 2 f 2 m a ca 2 2 3 to show that u a caea and the riesz inequality 1 2 holds for u once again we let b be a finite subset of a then u a b caea u x a b caea x 2 dx x 2 u x x a b ca x ea x 2 dx 20 u a b ea 2 20 u a b a 2 20 f a b a 2 the above estimation holds for any finite subset of a therefore since f a a a we conclude that u a a caea to prove the inequality 1 2 for u first we apply the upper estimation in 2 3 as follows u 2 20 u 2 20 u 2 m 2 0 a ca 2 6 recall that u f and denotes the convolution operation with a similar calculation one can show that u 2 m 2 a ca 2 this completes the proof of 1 2 for the function u with the riesz basis constants m 2 0 and m 2 hence the proof of the theorem is completed 2 1 application in theorem 1 1 we observed that for with 1 the paley wiener space pw r d is exactly the reproducing kernel hilbert space l 2 r and a translates of form an onb orthonormal basis for this space if and only if ea is an onb for l 2 motivated by this observation here we study the cases where for l 2 rd the hilbert space l 2 rd has a translate orthonormal basis or a translate riesz basis we will narrow our attention to the situation where is a band limited function i e it has bounded fourier transform support and l 2 rd is a paley wiener space first we need the following lemma lemma 2 2 for any pw there holds pw l 2 rd provided 0 0 proof since has fourier support in then by the fourier transform l 2 rd pw for the converse let f pw by our assumption on we have f l 2 with f f 0 this implies that for some g l 2 rd f g and hence the proof of the lemma is completed the following result is a direct consequence of the preceding lemma corollary 2 3 let pw such that 0 0 and 0 0 then set a is a riesz basis spectrum for if and only if la a a is a riesz basis for l 2 rd remark 2 4 a trivial consequence of the corollary 2 3 is that for any pw r d with 0 0 the system la a a is a reisz basis for l 2 rd if the set a is a riesz spectrum for 3 exponential frames the study of exponential frames was initiated by duffin and schaeffer in their work on non harmonic fourier series 13 the existence of exponential frames on l 2 for lebesgue measurable set in r is also known to be equivalent to the sampling and inter polation problems on the paley wiener space pw r see e g 26 22 20 for the most recent work for sampling and interpolation of paley wiener band limited functions on the locally compact abelian groups see e g 15 1 and for the results on non commutative settings see e g 11 in this section we show that the existence of exponential frames on l 2 is equivalent to the existence of translate basis for paley wiener spaces 7 definition 3 1 given a rd and l 2 rd we say that the translation system a a a is a frame for pw r d if there exist positive and finite constants c 1 c 2 such that for any f pw r d there holds c 1 f 2 a a f a 2 c 2 f 2 similarly ea a a is a frame for l 2 if there exist positive and finite constants c 1 c 2 such that for any given f l 2 c 1 f 2 a a f ea 2 c 2 f 2 a frame is called parseval if c 1 c 2 for a necessary and sufficient conditions for translate frames resp riesz basis with the spectrum set a z see e g 7 notice that any riesz basis is a frame but the converse dose not always hold for examples of frames containing no riesz bases we invite the reader to see the monograph 10 by christensen to state the first result of this section we need the following definition for pw r d let e x x 6 0 theorem 3 2 given a rd and rd the system ea a a is a frame for l 2 if and only if for any pw r d the system x a a a is frame for pw r d provided that there exist positive and finite constants m m such that m x 2 m for a e x e proof for f pw r d put u f e by the assumption on we will then have m f 2 u 2 m f 2 3 1 and by the parseval identity a f la 2 a u ea 2 3 2 if ea a a is a frame for l 2 with constants c 1 and c 2 then by 3 2 c 1 u 2 a f la 2 c 2 u 2 3 3 8 a combination of the inequalities in 3 3 and 3 1 proves that la is a frame for pw r d conversely assume that la is a frame for pw r d and u l 2 put h e u by the assumptions h belongs to l 2 if we let f denote the inverse fourier transform of h i e f h then a f la 2 a h ea 2 a u ea 2 3 4 if c 1 and c 2 are the frame constants for la then by 3 4 we will have c 1 f 2 a u ea 2 c 2 f 2 3 5 from the other hand we have f h e u and m x 2 m for a e x e therefore m 1 u 2 f 2 m 1 u 2 3 6 by interfering 3 6 in 3 5 the frame condition holds for ea and this completes the proof of the theorem remark 3 3 note that what distinguishes theorem 3 2 from 1 3 is that for frames we only require to be non vanishing on a subset of in the following we give an example of a frame with a smooth generator example 3 4 let u be a bump function on r with compact support 0 1 take any compact set 0 1 such that u is away from zero on i e infx u x 0 let u denote the inverse fourier transform of u put u then is smooth with e and n n z forms a frame for pw r if and only if a is a frame spectrum for we conclude this section with the following corollary corollary 3 5 let rd be a set with finite positive measure then a set a is a parseval frame spectrum for l 2 if and only if for any pw r d the system of translates a a is a parseval frame provided that is nowhere zero on 9 4 paley wiener valued gabor systems in this section we shall apply the results of previous sections to characterize vector valued gabor systems that are orthonormal basis for a class of vector valued signals before we state our results we need to introduce some notations here for given measurable space x and hilbert space y the space l l 2 x y is defined as class of all equivalent and measurable functions f x y for which f 2 l x f x 2 y d x l is a hilbert space with the norm l and the inner product f g l x f x g x y d x to avoid any confusion in the sequel we shall use subscripts for all inner products for the hilbert spaces lemma 4 1 let x be a measurable space and fn n be an orthonormal basis for l 2 x l 2 x d let y be a hilbert space and gm m be a family in y for any m n and x m define gm n x fn x gm then gm n m n is an orthonormal basis for the hilbert space l if and if gm m is an orthonormal basis for y proof for any m n and m n we have the following gm n gm n l x fm x gn fm x gn y d x 4 1 fm fm l 2 x gn gn y m m gn gn y this shows that the orthogonality of gm n m n is equivalent to the orthogonality of gm m and gm n 1 if and only if gn 1 let gm m be an orthonormal basis for y to prove the completeness of gm n in l let f l such that f gm n l 0 m n we show that f 0 by the definition of inner product we have 10 0 f gm n l x f x gm n x y d x 4 2 x f x fm x gn y d x x f x gn y fm x d x an fm where an x c x 7 f x gn y an is a measurable function and lies in l 2 x with an f since an fm l 2 x 0 for all m see above then an 0 by the completeness of fm from the other hand by the definition of an we have f x gn y 0 for a e x x since gn is complete in y then f x 0 for a e x x as we desired conversely assume that gm n m n is an orthonormal basis for the hilbert space l therefore by 4 1 gm is an orthonormal system we prove that if for g y and g gm 0 for all m then g must be zero for this for any n let us define the map bn x y x 7 fn x g then bn is measurable and it belongs to l with bn l g y by expanding bn in terms of gm n bn n m bn gm n lgm n 4 3 n m fn fn l 2 x g gm ygm n m g gm ygn m by the assumption that g gm y 0 we will have bn 0 this implies that bn x fn x g 0 for a e x since fn 6 0 then g must be zero and hence we are done we conclude this paper with another description of translate orthonormal bases in terms of vector valued gabor systems introduced in theorem 4 3 the result is a consequence of lemma 4 1 along theorem 1 1 first we need a definition here 11 definition 4 2 given a and u pw r d for any a b a the vector valued time frequency translate of u along a b a is given by ua b pw r d 7 eb tau the system g a u ga b ga b eb tau a b a 4 4 is called the corresponding vector valued gabor or weyl heisenberg system for the win dow signal u for more on traditional weyl heisenberg frames we refer the reader to 8 9 theorem 4 3 let 1 define l l 2 pw to be the hilbert space of all mea surable functions f pw with finite norm f l f 2 l 2 rd d then for any u pw tau a a is an orthonormal basis for pw if and only if the vector valued gabor system g a u is an orthonormal basis for l provided that u is nowhere zero on proof let u pw with u nowhere zero on let tau a a be an orthonormal basis for pw then by theorem 1 3 the exponentials ea form an orthonormal basis for l 2 and hence g a u given in 4 4 is an orthonormal basis for l by lemma 4 1 to prove the converse let g a u be an orthonormal basis for l the orthogonality of the family tau follows from the following simple relation for a a a and any b a a a ga b ga b l tau ta u l 2 rd to show tau spans pw let g pw such that g tau l 2 rd 0 for all a a we show that g 0 for this fix b and define wb pw 7 eb g it is clear that wb l with wb l g l 2 rd and for any a b we have wb ga b l geb eb tau l 2 rd d g tau l 2 rd eb eb d 4 5 since g tau l 2 rd 0 and the system g a u is complete in l then 4 5 implies that wb eb g 0 for almost every but eb 6 0 therefore g must be zero and hence we finish the proof we conclude this paper with the following remark remark 4 4 a special case of theorem 4 3 is when a zd this case has already been studied e g in 6 the author showed that a necessary and sufficient condition for tju j zd to be an orthonormal basis for its span is that for almost every x 0 1 d 12 j zd u x j 2 1 4 6 as we mentioned earlier the similar techniques used in 6 do not apply to our situation where a is any random set therefore in our paper we used different techniques to overcome the problem and could prove a characterization of translate bases onb riesz frame in terms of exponential bases on a domain
