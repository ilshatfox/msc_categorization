n 4 the n linear operator whose symbol is given by a product of two generic symbols of n linear hilbert transform type does not satisfy any lp estimates similar to those in ho lder inequality then we extend this result to multilinear operators whose symbols are given by a product of an arbitrary number of generic symbols of n linear hilbert transform kind as a consequence under the same assumption n 4 these immediately imply that for any 1 p 1 pn and 0 p with 1 p 1 1 pn 1 p there exist non degenerate subspaces irn of maximal dimension n 1 and mikhlin symbols m singular along for which the associated n linear multiplier operators tm do not map lp 1 lpn into lp these counterexamples are in sharp contrast with the bilinear case where similar operators are known to satisfy many lp estimates of ho lder type 1 introduction let n 2 for 1 n 1 ir n 1 an arbitrary vector consider the expression irn sgn 1 1 n 1 n 1 f f 1 1 f n 1 n 1 e 2 ix 1 n 1 d d 1 d n 1 1 where f f 1 fn 1 are all schwartz functions on the real line and x is a real number if all the en tries j j are different than 0 and 1 and also different from each other the n linear operator from 1 is called the n linear hilbert transform and it will be denoted by nht f f 1 fn 1 x no tice that if one erases the symbol sgn 1 1 n 1 n 1 2 from 1 the corresponding expression becomes the product of the functions involved f x f 1 x fn 1 x the main question about these operators is whether they satisfy estimates of ho lder type more precisely if there exist 1 p 1 pn and 0 p with 1 p 1 1 pn 1 p so that nht can be naturally extended as a bounded n linear operator from l p 1 lpn into lp the interest in their study comes from their close connection to the so called caldero n com mutators 1 3 indeed a direct calculation shows that modulo a universal constant one has the identity 0 1 n 1 nht f a a x d p v ir a x a y n 1 x y n f y dy 3 with a a as one can recognize the expression on the right hand side is precisely the n 1 th commutator of caldero n 1 3 if n 2 and is an arbitrary real number different than 0 and 1 http arxiv org abs 1209 6391 v 3 2 camil muscalu 1 the bilinear hilbert transform 2 ht does satisfy such estimates thanks to the work of lacey and thiele from 8 and 9 but for n 3 no positive results are presently known there are two very natural ways to generalize these operators which will be described next first for any k 1 and arbitrary vectors 1 k ir n 1 denote by nht 1 k the n linear operator defined by the product symbol k j 1 sgn j 1 1 j n 1 n 1 4 where j j 1 j n 1 for j 1 k the following theorem holds theorem 1 1 for any k 1 and generic numbers 1 k the bilinear operator 2 ht 1 k satisfies many lp estimates of ho lder type 1 it is a very simple exercise to show that this theorem follows from the k 1 case studied in 8 and 9 2 see also 6 for some related results in other words for bilinear operators the k 1 situation is as complex as the original k 1 case one can then naturally ask if there is an n linear generalization of the above result this may of course seem hopeless given the remarks made above however we will prove in this paper that if k 2 and n 4 the most natural n linear generalization of the above bilinear theorem is false more precisely we will prove theorem 1 2 let k 2 and n 4 then for any generic vectors 1 k ir n 1 the n linear operator nht 1 k does not satisfy any l p estimates of ho lder type this time and in fact for any n 3 the geometry of the symbols 4 becomes more compli cated and there do not seem to be any direct connections between the k 1 and k 2 cases in particular the case k 1 and n 3 remains open 3 this brings us naturally to the second class of extensions that we mentioned earlier we need to set up some notations first for any irn 1 denote by the n 1 dimensional subspace defined by 1 n 1 ir n 1 1 n 1 n 1 0 notice that the symbol 2 of nht is singular along while the symbol 4 of nht 1 k is singular along 1 k then for any ir n subspace of arbitrary dimension denote bym ir n the class of marcinkiewicz ho rmander mikhlin symbols which are singular along more specifically m ir n contains all bounded functions m which are smooth in the complement of and which satisfy 1 in the bilinear case the vectors j being one dimensional can be identified with the numbers j 2 indeed if n 2 one can first observe that the symbol 4 is constant on various angular regions centered at the origin and so it is enough to understand bilinear operators whose symbols are the characteristic functions of such angular sets but modulo some natural compositions with certain riesz projections the study of these can be easily reduced to the study of bilinear operators of type 2 ht the details are left to the reader 3 however in this particular case it has been noticed first heuristically in 10 and then rigorously in 4 that the trilinear hilbert transform cannot map lp 1 lp 2 lp 3 into lp for every 1 3 p see also 2 for another interesting tri linear counterexample 3 m 1 dist for sufficiently many multi indices observe also that if one has the inclusionm irn m ir n given any m m ir n one then denotes by tm the n linear operator defined by the same formula 1 with the symbol 2 replaced by m the following general theorem has been proved in 18 see also 6 for the particular bilinear case theorem 1 3 for any non degenerate subspace irn and m m ir n the multi linear operator tm satisfies many l p estimates of ho lder type as long as dim n 1 2 notice that the 2 ht case corresponds to n 2 and dim 1 while nht would be covered by the case of subspaces of maximal dimension dim n 1 4 given all these results described so far it is natural and quite tempting to believe that if nht were to satisfy some range of l p estimates then these estimates should remain valid for generic vectors and that at least some of them should be available for operators of type tm corresponding to generic symbols m in the classm ir n as well in other words that there exists a non trivial range of exponents where theorem 1 3 can be extended all the way to the maximal dimension dim n 1 however it is not difficult to see as a consequence of the previous theorem 1 2 that this ideal scenario cannot be true we have theorem 1 4 for any 1 p 1 pn and 0 p with 1 p 1 1 pn 1 p there exist non degenerate subspaces irn of maximal dimension n 1 and symbols m m ir n for which the associated n linear multiplier operators tm do not map l p 1 lpn into lp to prove theorem 1 4 one just has to observe that any nht 1 2 splits quite naturally as nht 1 2 tm 1 tm 2 where m 1 m 1 ir n and m 2 m 2 ir n since for generic vectors 1 and 2 the n linear operator nht 1 2 does not satisfy any l p estimates cf theorem 1 2 it is clearly impossible for both tm 1 and tm 2 to map l p 1 lpn into lp coming now back to theorem 1 2 its proof will follow from the following weaker but also more precise result proposition 1 5 for any k 2 there exists a positive integer n k such that for any n n k and generic vectors 1 k ir n 1 the n linear operator nht 1 k does not satisfy any l p estimates of ho lder type moreover the explicit counterexamples that will be constructed are irreducible in a certain natural sense the preciseness of the proposition lies on this irreducibility property of the counterexamples we will see later on that given any such irreducible counterexample for nht 1 k it can be naturally localized rescaled and translated in frequency so that it automatically becomes a counterexample which we call reducible this time to the boundedness of any nht 1 k as 4 the non degeneracy of is understood in the sense of 18 without being too specific let us just say that generic subspaces are non degenerate for instance if n 2 any line is non degenerate if it is not one of the coordinate axes nor the one defined by the equation 1 0 4 camil muscalu long as k k 5 the constants n k above will be quite explicit as we will prove the proposition for n k 2 k k 2 1 notice that when k 2 the expression 2 k k 2 1 is equal to 5 but we will remark later on that proposition 1 5 remains valid even for n 4 in particular theorem 1 2 will follow from the case k 2 and n 4 since as we mentioned the irreducible counterexamples for nht 1 2 can be transformed into reducible ones for any nht 1 k when k 2 let us also remark that when both k and n are sufficiently large and n n k one obtains quite a few distinct classes of counterexamples for the generic nht 1 k since besides the irreducible ones that will be constructed explicitly there will be various reducible counterexamples coming from the operators having a lower complexity it is also interesting to compare all of these negative results with the positive ones in 15 16 and 17 the rest of the paper is essentially devoted to the proof of proposition 1 5 the method we use is a generalization of the arguments from 14 and 19 see also 5 for some somewhat related ideas acknowledgement we wish to thank christoph thiele for various comments on a prelimi nary draft of the manuscript the present work has been partially supported by the nsf 2 some heuristical arguments before starting the actual proof we would like to describe a heuristical proof of proposition 1 5 which will motivate the rigorous argument that will be presented afterwards first of all let us observe that nht 1 k f f 1 fn 1 x admits the alternative kernel rep resentation 1 k i k p v irk f x t 1 tk n 1 j 1 f j x 1 jt 1 k jtk dt 1 t 1 dtk tk 5 this is a simple consequence of the well known identity i sgn 1 t applied k times to the symbol 4 consider now f x ei x k and f j x e i j x k for j 1 n 1 where 1 n 1 are real numbers that will be determined later on if one plugs in these functions into the formula 5 one formally obtains p v irk ei x t 1 tk k n 1 j 1 j x 1 j t 1 k jtk k dt 1 t 1 dtk tk the new expression x t 1 tk k n 1 j 1 j x 1 jt 1 k jtk k 6 should be interpreted as a polynomial in the k 1 variables x t 1 tk which is homogeneous of degree k an elementary combinatorial computation shows that this expression has precisely 2 k k 2 monomials for reasons that will be clearer a bit later we would like to choose our num bers 1 n 1 in such a way that all the coefficients of these monomials are zero with the 5 we thank christoph thiele for pointing out to us this observation 5 exception of the ones corresponding to xk and t 1 tk let us have a look at the coefficient of tk 1 for instance it is given by n 1 j 1 j k 1 j and so the fact that it is zero is equivalent to the fact that the n dimensional vector 1 n 1 is orthogonal to 1 k 1 1 k 1 n 1 since one can argue in a similar way for all the other mono mials our wish becomes equivalent to the fact that 1 n 1 is orthogonal to 2 k k 2 2 other vectors in irn since 1 k are generic all these vectors will be linearly independent and the fact that such a vector exists is guaranteed by the condition n 2 k k 2 1 stated in proposition 1 5 furthermore by a proper dilation one can also assume that the coefficient of t 1 tk will be equal to 1 in particular for any such a vector 1 n 1 one can write nht 1 k f f 1 fn 1 x 1 k irk eit 1 tk t 1 tk dt 1 dtk 7 on the other hand the right hand side of 7 can be further calculated as irk eit 1 tk t 1 tk dt 1 dtk irk 1 sgn t 1 tk 1 t 1 tk 1 dt 1 dtk 1 ir 1 t dt k 1 and this means that formally we have obtained the identity nht 1 k f f 1 fn 1 x 1 k 1 f x f 1 x fn 1 x ir 1 t dt k 1 8 notice that while the moduli of the initial functions are all equal to 1 the right hand side of 8 is infinite the idea now is to restrict all the functions above to an interval of type n n and to observe that as long as x belongs to an interval of the same size one has nht 1 k f f 1 fn 1 x c log n k 1 9 as n clearly 9 would imply proposition 1 5 and from now on the goal is to describe a rigorous proof it 6 3 proof of proposition 1 5 fix 1 k generic vectors in ir n 1 for n large enough define the function n x to be the characteristic function of the interval n n and n x to be a smooth function supported on n n and equal to 1 on n n where 0 is a number much smaller than 1 nk 1 consider real numbers 1 n 1 chosen to satisfy all the requirements of section 2 de fine the functions f f 1 fn 1 by f x n x e i xk 6 the functions f f 1 fn 1 which appeared in 9 are the old ones restricted smoothly to an interval of type n n 6 camil muscalu and f j x n x e i j x k for 1 j n 1 we claim that there exist small constants c and c depending on all these parameters with the exception of n so that nht 1 k f f 1 fn 1 x c log n k 1 10 as long as x c n c n clearly as we pointed out earlier 10 would immediately imply proposition 1 5 since it holds for arbitrarily large n to prove the claim let us first observe that since f f 1 fn 1 are smooth and compactly supported formula 5 can be applied and one has nht 1 k f f 1 fn 1 x ei 1 n 1 x k 1 k i k irk n x t 1 tk n 1 j 1 n x 1 jt 1 k jtk eit 1 tk t 1 tk dt 1 dtk 11 by splitting eit 1 tk as eit 1 tk cos t 1 tk i sin t 1 tk and ignoring the harmless factor ei 1 n 1 x k one can decompose the rest of 11 as 1 k i k irk n x t 1 tk n 1 j 1 n x 1 jt 1 k jtk cos t 1 tk t 1 tk dt 1 dtk 12 i 1 k i k irk n x t 1 tk n 1 j 1 n x 1 jt 1 k jtk sin t 1 tk t 1 tk dt 1 dtk 13 it is a good moment now to pause and make a few important remarks regarding the supports of our integrands in 12 and 13 consider a generic set of the form t 1 tk ir k a 1 t 1 ktk b 14 with a 0 b and 1 k arbitrary clearly this set is a k dimensional strip containing the origin and lying between the hyperspaces 1 t 1 ktk a and 1 t 1 ktk b which are both perpendicular to the given vector moreover the width of this strip is o b a as a consequence the support of the integrands in 12 and 13 lies at the intersection of n such k dimensional strips since the vectors 1 k are generic if one picks c small enough and x c n c n this intersection will be a bounded domain in irk containing the origin and also contained in a large cube of sidelength o n hence the term 13 is well defined and 7 this means that the term 12 is well defined as well being the difference of two well defined expressions in particular from 11 12 and 13 one can see that nht 1 k f f 1 fn 1 x 1 k irk n x t 1 tk n 1 j 1 n x 1 jt 1 k jtk sin t 1 tk t 1 tk dt 1 dtk 15 for every x c n c n next we would like to observe that modulo some harmless error terms one can replace all the n functions in 15 by the corresponding n to see this let us denote the n linear inner expression in 15 by e n n n x one can write e n n n x e n n n x e n n n n x and it is not difficult to see that the absolute value of the error term e n n n n x is at most o 1 as a consequence of the fact that the function sin x x is bounded and that n n is supported on a union of two strips of width o 1 nk 1 iterating this argument n times one obtains from 15 that nht 1 k f f 1 fn 1 x 1 k irk n x t 1 tk n 1 j 1 n x 1 jt 1 k jtk sin t 1 tk t 1 tk dt 1 dtk o 1 16 for every x c n c n clearly the inner term on the right hand side of 16 can be written as dx sin t 1 tk t 1 tk dt 1 dtk 17 where dx is a compact and convex domain in ir k containing the origin and having also the property that c 1 n c 1 n k dx c 1 n c 1 n k where c 1 is small and c 1 is large and they depend on 1 k but are otherwise independent on x c n c n split now 17 as dx sin t 1 tk t 1 tk dt 1 dtk 8 camil muscalu c 1 n c 1 n k sin t 1 tk t 1 tk dt 1 dtk dx c 1 n c 1 n k sin t 1 tk t 1 tk dt 1 dtk 18 we will prove in the next two sections that the the first term in 18 is positive and is bounded from below by c log n k 1 while the absolute value of the second term in 18 is bounded from above by c log n k 2 combining these two facts with the previous 16 will imply the desired 10 4 lower logarithmic bounds in this section we prove the lower logarithmical bounds for the first term in 18 that have been mentioned at the end of the previous section 3 proposition 4 1 for any integer k 1 there exists a constant c c k with the property that n n n n sin t 1 tk t 1 tk dt 1 dtk c log n k 1 19 as long as n is large enough the proof of this proposition 4 1 is based on the following lemma whose enuntiation requires some additional notations if f is a bounded measurable function defined on the interval 0 we denote by h f x the linear operator given by h f x 1 x x 0 f u du for every x 0 we will also denote by hl the composition of h with itself l times as long as l is an integer greater or equal than 1 and by h 0 the identity operator lemma 4 2 for any integer k 1 there exist a small constant ck 1 and a large one ck 1 with the property that t 0 hk 1 f u du ck 1 log t k 1 20 for every t ck 1 where f u sin u u let us first assume this lemma 4 2 and show how our previous proposition 4 1 can be reduced to it if a is any real number different than zero the function s sin as s is an even function and in particular this implies that n n sin as s ds 2 n 0 sin as s ds using this observation several times one can see that n n n n sin t 1 tk t 1 tk dt 1 dtk 2 k n 0 n 0 sin t 1 tk t 1 tk dt 1 dtk 21 9 we claim now that the following identity holds n 0 n 0 sin t 1 tk t 1 tk dt 1 dtk nk 0 hk 1 f u du 22 clearly if we take this equality for granted then 22 21 and 20 together imply the desired 19 for simplicity we will prove 22 in the particular case k 3 and leave the general case to the reader since it does not require any additional ideas one can write n 0 n 0 n 0 sin t 1 t 2 t 3 t 1 t 2 t 3 dt 1 dt 2 dt 3 n 0 n 0 n 0 sin t 1 t 2 t 3 t 3 dt 3 dt 1 t 1 dt 2 t 2 n 0 n 0 nt 1 t 2 0 sin x x dx dt 2 t 2 dt 1 t 1 n 0 n 2 t 1 0 y 0 sin x x dx dy y dt 1 t 1 n 3 0 z 0 y 0 sin x x dx dy y dz z n 3 0 1 z z 0 1 y y 0 sin x x dx dy dz n 3 0 h 2 f z dz as desired we are left with the proof of lemma 4 2 we proceed by induction clearly the k 1 case is a simple consequence of the fact that 0 sin x x dx 2 suppose now that 20 holds for the parameter k 1 and we would like to prove it for k one writes t 0 hkf u du t 0 1 x x 0 hk 1 f u du dx 23 ck 1 0 t ck 1 24 the absolute value of the first term in 24 is clearly at most ck 1 given that f u 1 using the induction hypothesis on the other hand one can estimate the second term in 24 from below by ck 1 t ck 1 1 x log x k 1 dx ck 1 k t ck 1 log x k dx ck 1 k log t k logck 1 k all of these imply that the left hand side of 23 can be estimated from below by ck 1 k log t k logck 1 k ck 1 but this expression is at least as big as ck 1 2 k log t k if t is large enough and this completes the proof of lemma 4 2 and therefore of proposition 4 1 10 camil muscalu 5 upper logarithmic bounds our final goal now is to prove the upper logarithmical bounds for the second term in 18 that have been claimed in section 3 proposition 5 1 let d be a compact and convex domain in irk having the property that cn cn k d cn cn k where c and c are fixed constants and n is large enough then there exists c c k so that d cn cn k sin t 1 tk t 1 tk dt 1 dtk c log n k 2 25 we claim that the above proposition 5 1 follows easily from the following lemma 5 2 let d be a compact and convex domain in irk having the property that d n n k then there exists c c k so that d sin t 1 tk t 1 tk dt 1 dtk c log n k 1 26 let us see first why lemma 5 2 implies proposition 5 1 if t t 1 tk d cn cn k then at least for one index 1 i k one must have ti cn cn but then this means that ti cn cn cn cn let us examine now the following two extremal cases suppose first that ti cn cn cn cn for every 1 i k in this case it is not difficult to see that the integral over that corresponding region is at most cn cn cn cn dt 1 t 1 dtk tk which is clearly bounded by a constant independent of n assume now that we are in the opposite situation when precisely one index i has the property that ti cn cn cn cn by symmetry we can also assume that that index is 1 and that t 1 cn cn in this case it is also not difficult to see that the integral over the corresponding region can be expressed as cn cn 1 t 1 dt 1 sin t 1 tk t 2 tk dt 2 dtk dt 1 27 where dt 1 t 2 tk t 1 t 2 tk d it is natural to change variables t 1 k 11 t j s j for 2 j k and rewrite 27 as 11 cn cn 1 t 1 d t 1 sin s 2 sk s 2 sk ds 2 dsk dt 1 28 where d t 1 is also compact and convex and has the property that d t 1 cnt 1 k 1 1 cnt 1 k 1 1 k 1 using lemma 5 2 one can then bound 28 easily by c log n k 2 which is of course acceptable by 25 the general case when an arbitrary number of indices i satisfy ti cn cn cn cn can be treated similarly and the corresponding upper bound will be of the form c log n l for some 0 l k 2 since there are only a finite number of such situations this completes the proof of 25 we are left with the proof of lemma 5 2 we proceed as before by induction the case k 1 is obviously true since d is now an interval a b and 26 becomes equivalent to b a sin x x dx c let us consider now the general case of 26 assuming by the induction hypothesis that all the previous ones are known decompose the inner integral in 26 as d sin t 1 tk t 1 tk dt 1 dtk 29 d t t 1 sin t 1 tk t 1 tk dt 1 dtk log n d 0 d t 2 d t 2 d 1 sin t 1 tk t 1 tk dt 1 dtk 7 arguing as before and using the induction hypothesis one can see that d t 2 d t 2 d 1 sin t 1 tk t 1 tk dt 1 dtk cd k 2 30 finally using 30 in 29 one obtains the desired 26 6 further remarks first of all as we promised we would like to explain why proposition 1 5 holds true even for k 2 and n 4 recall from 5 the kernel representation of 4 ht 1 2 f f 1 f 2 f 3 x as 1 2 p v ir 2 f x t s 3 j 1 f j x 1 js 2 jt dt t ds s 31 where 1 1 1 1 2 1 3 and 2 2 1 2 2 2 3 are two generic vectors in ir 3 7 we use the notation t max 1 i k ti 12 camil muscalu consider as before f x ei x 2 and f j x e i j x 2 for j 1 2 3 where 1 2 3 are real numbers that will be determined later on if one formally plugs in these functions into 31 the corresponding expression in 6 becomes a polynomial in the variables x t s which is ho mogeneous of degree 2 this polynomial has precisely six monomials namely xt xs ts t 2 s 2 and x 2 each of which having its corresponding coefficient we would like to choose our num bers 1 2 3 so that the coefficients of xt xs and s 2 are all zero as we discussed earlier in section 2 this amounts to pick a vector 1 2 3 ir 4 orthogonal to three other generic linearly independent 4 dimensional vectors which is clearly possible using this choice the analogous of 7 becomes 4 ht 1 2 f f 1 f 2 f 3 x 1 2 ir 2 ei t 2 ei ts dt t ds s 32 where are real numbers depending on the previous parameters 1 2 and 1 2 3 by construction one can also assume without loss of generality that 0 as in section 2 one then observes that the expression on the right hand side of 32 can be calculated further as ir 2 ei t 2 ei ts dt t ds s 1 ir sgn t t ei t 2 dt 1 0 ei t t dt 1 0 cos t t dt i 2 and while 1 cos t t dt is bounded the integral 1 0 cos t t dt is infinite to transform this heuristical argument into a rigorous one one proceeds as before the details are left to the reader then we would like to describe the construction of the reducible counterexamples from the previous irreducible ones completing in this way the proof of theorem 1 2 fix k 2 and n such that n n k here if k 2 we should replace n 2 by 4 since we now know that proposition 1 5 still holds in this situation consider also a generic operator of type nht 1 k where k k to construct such a reducible counterexample for it we proceed as follows at the first step take the irreducible counterexample given by proposition 1 5 for the less complex operator nht 1 k by a simple approximation argument one can also assume without loss of generality that the functions which appear in the counterexample are all compactly suppported in frequency then by using the dilation invariance of these operators one can rescale it and obtain a counterexample whose fourier transform is supported inside the unit cube of irn after that using the modulation invariance of the operators one observes that this unit cube can be translated anywhere along the subspace 1 k and still remains a counterexample for the boundedness of nht 1 k it is not difficult to observe that one can do this in such a way that the new translated unit cube does not intersect any of the remaining subspaces k 1 k but then this means that these new functions which correspond to the new rescaled and translated cube automatically become a counterexample for our original more complex operator nht 1 k it is also natural to ask given the previous theorem 1 3 and theorem 1 4 what can be said in the remaining cases when the dimension of the singularity subspace satisfies 13 dim n 1 2 n n 1 2 using an argument similar to the one before one can prove corollary 6 1 let n 5 for any 1 p 1 pn and 0 p with 1 p 1 1 pn 1 p and for any integer k satisfying k n n 1 2 1 2 there exist non degenerate subspaces irn with dim k and symbols m m ir n for which the associated n linear multiplier operators tm do not map l p 1 lpn into lp proof let d 1 and denote by k t t 1 t d 1 the first d dimensional riesz kernel it is a classical well known fact that k cd 1 where cd is a constant depending only on the dimension see for instance 20 for n d consider the n linear operator defined by the formula ir 2 d f 1 x a 1 t b 1 s fn x an t bn s k t k s d t d s 33 where a j b j are generic vectors in ir d while a j t and b j s are d dimensional inner products for 1 j d recall that the functions f 1 fn are all defined on the real line alternatively as before one can rewrite 33 as irn k a k b f 1 1 f n n e 2 ix 1 n d 1 d n where a a 1 an and b b 1 bn are both matrices having d lines and n columns and they define linear maps from irn to ird since k is singular only at the origin it is clear that the symbol of our operator k a k b will be singular along ker a ker b and for generic matrices a and b both of these subspaces will have dimension n d consider now f j x e 2 i j x 2 for 1 j n where the real numbers j n j 1 will be determined later if one formally plugs in these functions into the formula 33 the exponent of the new complex exponential is the quadratic expression 1 x a 1 t b 1 s 2 n x an t bn s 2 34 depending on the variables x t 1 td s 1 sd if one expands 34 one can see by an elementary calculation that it contains 2 d 2 2 d 1 quadratic monomials we choose now the vector 1 n in such a way that all the coefficients of these monomials vanish with the exception of the coefficients corresponding to x 2 t 1 s 1 td sd as we have seen before this is equivalent to the fact that is orthogonal to 2 d 2 d other linearly independent n dimensional vectors which is clearly possible as long as n 2 d 2 d 1 from this we deduce that d n 1 2 1 2 which in particular implies dim ker a dim ker b n n 1 2 1 2 35 14 camil muscalu on the other hand it is not difficult to see that the absolute value of the corresponding expression in 33 is comparable to the divergent integral ird t 21 t d 2 d t a fact that can be used also as before to show that the n linear operator 33 does not satisfy any lp estimates since this operator can be also naturally decomposed as tm 1 tm 2 with m 1 mker a ir n and m 1 mker b ir n it is clearly impossible for both tm 1 and tm 2 to satisfy the required particular estimates of corollary 6 1 another interesting consequence is the following on the one hand let us observe that the orem 1 2 holds not only for the operators nht 1 k but also for operators whose symbols are given by products of type 4 where sgn is replaced by 1 ir the characteristic function of the set of positive real numbers indeed this change corresponds to replacing the previous kernels 1 t by 1 t 0 t where 0 t is the dirac delta distribution centered at the origin and it is not difficult to see that this does not change the outcome of the previous arguments in particular when k 2 this implies that n linear operators with symbols such as the ones described on the right hand side of figure 1 do not satisfy any lp estimates of ho lder type 8 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 figure 1 good and bad symbols on the other hand if the n linear hilbert transforms were to satisfy some lp estimates then by taking the difference between two generic ones one would obtain the same lp estimates for n linear operators given by symbols such as the ones described on the left hand this time side of figure 1 let us end with a few remarks on the previous identity 3 first of all it can be suggestively rewritten as 0 1 n 1 nht f a a x d p v ir t t a x n 1 f x t dt t 36 where in general tg x g x t g x is the finite difference of the function g at scale t in 12 the following generalization of it has been noticed 0 1 n 1 0 1 n 1 nht 1 k f a a x d 1 d k 8 the diagram should be understood in irn the two lines represent two generic hyperspaces 1 and 2 15 p v irk

a k l these operators appeared naturally in 12 as part of a generalization of caldero n s theory to classes of functions having arbitrary polynomial growth for more details the reader is referred to
