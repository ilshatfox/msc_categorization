mea sure on the sphere e f is a quasi extremal pair of sets for t if t e f e d d 1 f d d 1 in this article we explicitly de fine a family f of quasi extremal pairs of sets for t we prove that f is fundamental in the sense that every quasi extremal pair e f is comparable in a rather strong sense to a pair from f this extends work carried out by m christ for convolution with surface measure on the paraboloid 1 introduction let t be the linear operator which acts on the continuous functions on rd by convolution with surface measure on the unit sphere which we will denote by sd 1 that is for a continuous function f on rd tf is defined by tf x sd 1 f x d then it is well known that t extends to a continuous operator from lp rd to lq rd if and only if p 1 q 1 lies in the closed triangle with vertices 0 0 1 1 d d 1 1 d 1 our goal in this article will be to study the behavior of this operator at the endpoint p q d 1 d d 1 in more detail in particular we continue work begun by christ in 2 by partially characterizing quasi extremal and quasi extremal pairs for t let f and g be measurable functions not identically zero then by the boundedness of t from l d 1 d to ld 1 and duality we have that tf g f l d 1 d g l d 1 d we say that f g is an quasi extremal pair if we have in addition the lower bound tf g f l d 1 d g l d 1 d we say that f g is simply quasi extremal if f g is quasi extremal for some 1 1991 mathematics subject classification 42 b 10 primary 44 a 35 44 a 12 secondary the author was supported in part by nsf grant dms 040126 1 http arxiv org abs 1710 08304 v 1 2 betsy stovall if e and f are borel sets having positive lebesgue measures then e f is an quasi extremal or a quasi extremal pair if e f is notation as indicated above we will write sd 1 x rd x 1 we will employ the symbols and their related symbols and as follows let a and b be positive numbers and p be some statement we will say that p implies that a b when there exists a large universal constant c such that p implies that a cb we will say that a b implies p when there exists a small universal constant c such that a cb implies that p holds this use is fairly standard in the harmonic analysis literature we will also use the somewhat less standard notation t e f t e f for measurable sets e and f here g f is the l 2 inner product rd fg dx where dx denotes lebesgue measure finally we will write to indicate lebesgue measure of a subset e of rn where n will be clear from the context acknowledgements the author is indebted to her advisor michael christ for suggesting this question and for the invaluable help and advice he gave during work on this project she would also like to thank z gautam and t tao for pointing out an error in an earlier formulation of theorem 2 1 finally the author would like to express her gratitude toward c thiele and the anonymous referee from the illinois journal of math for other helpful advice and suggestions 2 statement of results before stating our results we give an example of a quasi extremal pair of sets let 1 be a positive number and let r r 1 rd 1 be a d 1 tuple of positive numbers satisfying ri 1 1 i d 1 2 1 ri ri 1 1 i d 2 2 2 ri 1 2 rj 1 i j d 1 2 3 note that 2 3 is equivalent to r 1 1 2 rd 1 on account of 2 2 we use the redundant formulation to avoid confusion later on then we define e r to be the set of x rd such that x 1 r 1 xd 1 rd 1 dist x ed sd 1 xd 1 and f r to be the set of y rd such that y 1 r 1 yd 1 rd 1 dist y sd 1 yd 0 here ed 0 0 1 quasi extremals 3 these pairs of sets are essentially thin neighborhoods of dual ellipsoids lying on the sphere in particular the ellipsoids share an orientation the product of corresponding radii is constant and the ellipsoids lie at opposite poles though of different spheres the pair above is quasi extremal as will be shown in 4 our main theorem states that every quasi extremal pair e f after a rotation and translation is comparable to one of the pairs given above this comparability is rather strong and its extent is quantitative in certainly if r o d is a rotation and x 0 rd then the sets re r x 0 rf r x 0 2 4 are also quasi extremal throughout we will refer to such translated and rotated versions of our original pairs assuming 2 1 2 3 as the basic quasi extremal pairs the following theorems will involve constants c and a which depend only on the dimension d and in particular not on the radii r or the sets e f theorem 2 1 for every 0 and every quasi extremal pair e f there exists a basic quasi extremal pair e f such that t e e f f c 1 d 1 d 1 t e f and e c a e f c a f hence a quasi extremal pair e f may be compared to a basic quasi extremal pair whose elements are not too much bigger than e and f we will also show that theorem 2 1 implies that a quasi extremal pair e f may be compared to a basic quasi extremal pair whose elements are smaller than e f theorem 2 2 for every 0 and every quasi extremal pair e f there exists a basic quasi extremal pair e f such that t e e f f c 1 at e f and e e f f though theorem 2 2 is perhaps more aesthetically pleasing than theorem 2 1 because only one comparison of e f with the basic quasi extremal pair involves the loss of a power of theorem 2 1 is actually the stronger of the two finally theorem 2 2 is the analogue of the main theorem of 2 and by the arguments in that work implies the following theorem on quasi extremal pairs of functions 4 betsy stovall theorem 2 3 for every 0 and every quasi extremal pair of non negative functions f g there exist sets e f and real numbers s t 0 such that s e f t f g furthermore there exists a basic quasi extremal pair e f with e e f f such that s t t e e f f c 1 a tf g except for the verification of condition 2 3 our proof is a more or less straightforward adaptation of 2 where possible we will refer to that article for details in particular for the proof of theorem 2 3 we refer the reader to 2 3 some context first we compare the results here to those obtained in 2 in that work christ considered the operator tp defined by convolution with a measure on the paraboloid p x rd xd x 2 tp f x rd 1 f x t xd t 2 dt he proved that the basic quasi extremal pairs for tp also at the l p lq endpoint d 1 d d 1 are obtained by applying a rotation s o d fixing the xd component to the following pairs if x 0 y 0 rd with x 0 y 0 p and r 1 rd 1 are any positive radii define ep x 0 y 0 r to be the set of x rd such that xi x 0 i ri 1 i d 1 xd y 0 d x y 0 2 and fp x 0 y 0 r to be the set of y rd such that yi y 0 i ri 1 i d 1 yd x 0 d y x 0 2 thus the families of basic quasi extremal pairs for the two operators are similar the chief difference is in the admissible radii for convolution with surface measure on the paraboloid any collection of radii r 1 rd 1 0 give rise to quasi extremal pairs for convolution with surface measure on the sphere compactness forces us to take 0 1 and ri 1 the further condition 2 3 however comes from geometric properties other than compactness we will write ep r ep 0 0 r and fp r fp 0 0 r one explanation for the extra rigidity of the quasi extremals for the sphere is that the paraboloid posses a product structure while the sphere does not one can see a manifestation of this by considering the pair e ep 1 1 f fp 1 1 quasi extremals 5 the radii are admissible for the paraboloid and one may think of e and f as exhibiting the product structure p p rk 0 d 1 k p 0 k r d 1 k in the case of the sphere however 2 3 fails and the radii are not admissible when one considers either the sphere or the paraboloid two of the basic quasi extremal pairs of sets are quite well known when the ri all equal e is a ball of radius and f is a neighborhood of a patch of the hypersurface when the ri all equal 1 2 e f is essentially the knapp example e 1 2 1 2 d 1 f e y 0 y 0 ed for sd 1 and 0 for p together these examples are often used to show that p q d 1 d d 1 is an endpoint for the lebesgue bounds for t or tp as in 9 for instance the operators studied here and in 2 are merely examples of a much larger class called generalized radon transforms in the recent literature see the articles 6 by phong and stein and more recently 7 by schlag for some results and an excellent discussion of a larger class of operator defined by integration on curved hypersurfaces one motivation for studying these radon like transforms comes from partial differential equations for example in 3 dimensions the solution at fixed times to the initial value problem for the wave equation is solved by convolution with surface measure on the sphere at the other dimensional extreme from hypersurfaces tao and wright in 11 have proved lp lq bounds near the endpoint for operators defined by integration over one dimensional curves christ has reproved their result in 1 using similar techniques the article by tao and wright in particular contains an extensive bibliography which may be of interest to the reader between these extremes the lp lq bounds are still largely unknown but curvature is still important see 4 a more general discussion of the role curvature plays in harmonic analysis may be found for instance in the two expository articles 10 and 5 4 basic quasi extremal pairs of sets in this section we will prove that the basic quasi extremal pairs of sets are in fact quasi extremal proposition 4 1 let 1 0 and suppose that r 1 rd 1 satisfy in equalities 2 1 2 3 then the pair e r f r which was defined in 2 is quasi extremal because the operator t commutes with translations and rotations we ob tain as a corollary corollary 4 2 if r o d is a rotation x rd and 0 and r 1 rd 1 0 satisfy 2 1 2 3 then re r x rf r x is a quasi extremal pair 6 betsy stovall proof of proposition 4 1 it suffices to prove the proposition under the addi tional assumptions that 1 ri 1 1 i d 1 4 1 let e e r and f f r then it is easy to check that e d 1 i 1 ri f d 1 i 1 ri so what we must show to verify quasi extremality of e f is that t e f d 4 2 let x e cr c where c 0 is sufficiently small depending only on d for later purposes consider the set f 0 x s rd 1 si xi c ri 1 i d 1 then by the smallness of the ri and ri f 0 x k j 1 rj we will prove that s f 0 x x s 1 s 2 f r 4 3 this will imply that t f x k j 1 rj from which the estimate 4 2 will follow first suppose that rd 1 1 2 let x e cr c and s f 0 x then xd co xi si co ri xd 1 s 2 co 1 x s 2 where the second inequality follows from ri 1 2 ri therefore 4 3 holds similarly it is not difficult to show that 4 3 holds when r 1 1 2 hence we may assume that there exists an index k 1 k d 2 so that rk 1 2 rk 1 recall the monotonicity assumption 2 2 let x e cr c and s f 0 x and define t s 1 sk and y xk 1 xd 1 to verify 4 3 it suffices to show that xd 1 s 2 1 x s 2 4 4 we note that xd 1 x 2 1 co and that by our choice of k x 2 y 2 co x s 2 t 2 co s 2 t 2 y 2 co therefore 4 4 will follow from 1 y 2 1 t 2 1 y 2 t 2 1 co 4 5 quasi extremals 7 by condition 2 3 on the ri either r 1 3 4 or rd 1 1 4 assuming the latter we use a taylor series expansion to obtain 1 y 2 1 y 2 2 co and 1 t 2 y 2 1 t 2 y 2 2 1 t 2 co therefore 1 y 2 1 t 2 1 y 2 t 2 1 y 2 2 1 1 t 2 1 co by smallness of the ri and the ri 1 t 2 1 so the term on the right is bounded by c r 2 d 1 r 1 2 o inequality 4 5 follows from another application of condition 2 3 in the other case r 1 3 4 we have that r 1 1 4 and the verification of 4 5 is the same as in the previous case with the roles of y and t reversed 5 setup for the proof of the main theorem let e f be an quasi extremal pair of sets using a partition of unity we may write t m j 1 tj where tj is equal to convolution with aj d and the tj and m depend on the dimension alone here d is surface measure on sd 1 and aj is a smooth function supported on a set uj sd 1 having diameter 1 by the triangle inequality e f is m 1 quasi extremal for at least one of the tj by means of a rotation we may assume that uj is contained in a small ball centered at 0 0 1 henceforth we will write t tj u uj and m 1 of course this means for instance that t is no longer self adjoint we define t e f e and t e f f then represents the average size of t f for points in e and represents the average size of t e for points in f see for instance 3 for a proof of the following lemma lemma 5 1 for each integer n 1 there exists x 0 e and measurable sets i ri d 1 1 i n such that 1 i i 1 rd 1 for 8 betsy stovall 2 i n and such that whenever t t 1 ti i 1 i n s rd 1 t s i 1 if i n is odd if i n is even x i j 1 1 j tj 1 t 2 f if i is odd e if i is even here the implicit constants depend on n and d henceforth we will assume that n is fixed and sufficiently large say 5 or so and that x 0 and 1 2 satisfy the conclusions of the lemma 6 the shape of 1 techniques used in this section have previously appeared in the work 2 by christ and are similar to arguments used by schlag in 7 6 1 inflation bound let s rd 1 and t 1 td 1 t r d 1 d 1 with s ti 1 1 i d 1 we define r d 1 d rd d 1 by s t j tj s 1 tj 2 1 s 2 where we are writing x rd d 1 as x x 1 x d 1 with x j rd we may compute detd det fs t 1 fs td 1 where for s t rd 1 with s t 1 fs t t 1 t 2 s 1 s 2 see the end of this section for a few remarks concerning this function we would like to obtain a lower bound for e for s 1 s 1 let f s t rd 1 t 1 and s t 2 if we define s t rd 1 r d 1 d 1 s 1 t f s d 1 then ed 1 write 0 s 1 s 2 and i ti 1 ti 2 1 i d 1 then for each x x 1 xd 1 rd d 1 the pre image of x under has cardinality s t s t x 0 1 d 1 sd 1 d 0 xi i 1 i d 1 d 1 j 0 d 1 i 0 sd 1 xi xj d 1 i 0 sd 1 xi d 1 quasi extremals 9 where x 0 0 by bezout s theorem see 8 for instance for x lying off of a measure zero indeed algebraic subset of rd d 1 the right side is bounded by a constant depending only on d an elementary proof of this fact is also possible one can take advantage of the fact that the intersection of two spheres neither a subset of the other is either empty or a lower dimensional sphere from the cardinality bound established above we have the estimate e d 1 1 f s d 1 det fs t 1 fs td 1 d t ds 6 2 approximation by convex sets we will use an argument from 2 to obtain a lower bound for this term and to describe a typical set f s by symmetry a similar description will apply to 1 a set v rd 1 is balanced if v v lemma 6 1 let 0 then for any lebesgue measurable set a rd 1 with 0 a there exists a bounded balanced convex set v rd 1 such that whenever v v is a balanced convex set with v 1 2 v then a v v a v a moreover ad 1 det u d u v a d 1 a v d 1 here the implicit constants depend only on and d note that as a consequence of the lemma the convex set v satisfies v a the proof is contained in two somewhat more general lemmas in 2 we only present a sketch of the argument here the first part is proved via a stopping time procedure we start with a large balanced convex set v having size 2 m a so that v a 3 4 a if v satisfies the conclusion of the lemma we are done otherwise there is a bad set v v with which we replace v the main trick in this portion of the proof is to use to show that this procedure terminates before v reaches a the proof of the second part of the lemma uses the defining property of v and the identity det u d 1 i 1 dist ui vi 1 where v 0 0 and vi span u 1 ui to bound u away from the sets where det u vanishes we apply the lemma to the set fs f s for the moment leaving unde termined to obtain a balanced convex set v s rd 1 because near zero 10 betsy stovall fs is a diffeomorphism with bounded differential we have that v s fs f s f s hence by making the change of variables ui fs ti 1 i d 1 we see that det fs t 1 fs td 1 d t ds 1 fs f s d 1 det u d u ds 1 v s 1 d 1 f s d 1 1 assuming that 1 d 1 this implies that e d 1 d from the definitions of and this immediately yields the well known bound t e f e d d 1 f d d 1 on the other hand we are assuming that t e f e d d 1 f d d 1 which implies that e d 1 d 1 d 6 1 since the series of inequalities above imply that e d 1 1 d 1 1 v s 1 d 1 ds the above upper bound on e means that for most in particular at least one of the s 1 we must have v s c the above argument with minor changes enables us to assume that for some rn with 1 f 1 is contained in a balanced convex set v of size c by john s theorem we may assume that v is actually an ellipsoid 6 3 comments on fs if we let g t 1 t 2 for t 1 then the mapping fs is equal to g g s all of the material in 6 7 is applicable to any sufficiently nice mapping g with g 0 0 and detd 2 g 0 6 0 in the case of 6 this generality was pointed out to the author by m christ and in the case of 7 it can be obtained from his work in 2 together with some additional details in the following section for two choices of g fs has a particularly nice form when t tp the operator mentioned in 3 g s s 2 in this case of course fs t t s for all s and t therefore f 1 is contained in a quasi extremals 11 balanced convex set if and only if the vertical projection of 1 to r d 1 is contained in a convex set which is balanced with respect to when g s 1 s 2 g may be thought of as the function which maps a point sd 1 to the point on rd 1 0 which is collinear with 0 and this function maps great circles to straight lines so f 1 is contained in a convex set if and only if 1 is contained in a geodesically convex subset of the upper hemisphere the point 1 2 would be contained in this convex set but the set would not be balanced about that point in any natural rotationally invariant sense 7 the shape of f s 7 1 slicing bound let be defined by s t t s 1 t 2 1 s 2 for s t rd 1 with s t 1 then 2 e let b be the unit ball in r d 1 and let a be a positive definite symmetric linear transformation having norm 1 in this subsection we prove the following lemma lemma 7 1 if f 1 a b where 1 then e deta 1 a df s 1 fs t dt ds here we recall that fs t t 1 t 2 s 1 s 2 the proof of lemma 7 1 is modeled on a proof of the analogous lemma in 2 if rd 1 is a unit vector and a rd 1 then we define s a r f 1 a r a thus when is fixed for each s 1 there is a unique choice of a r with a r 1 such that s s a r for the moment let and a be fixed we will abuse notation by writing s r s a r for s 1 let g s 1 s 2 and for r r and u rd 1 with r u 1 define r u u g u s r g s r note that when s s r and u t s r r u s t 12 betsy stovall both r u and r u are elements of rd so one can compute the jacobian detd r u the lemma would follow from the estimate detd r u du dr 7 1 for measurable sets details are forthcoming we will establish the validity of 7 1 by showing that is nearly injective supposing that r u r u one has that u u and g u s r g s r g u s r g s r fu r we claim that for u 6 0 r 7 fu r is o 1 to 1 on r 1 by rotating coordinates if necessary we may assume that a e 1 and set aa 1 2 a 0 then s r f 10 re 1 a 0 re 1 a 0 1 re 1 a 0 2 using this one can explicitly compute that f u r vanishes if and only if a certain polynomial pu a 0 r of degree o 1 vanishes since pu a 0 is the zero polynomial if and only if u 0 the claim is proved and we may use the estimate 7 1 with and a fixed we define a r t s a r t 2 a r u r u s a r a so far we have shown that for each a and e a a a d 2 g s r 1 fs r t dt dr now for each e a a 1 a da deta 1 2 a d 2 g s 1 fs t dt ds where the last inequality follows from the change of variables s s a r and the fact that det df s 1 averaging with respect to unit vectors completes the proof of the lemma 7 2 combining the inflation and slicing bounds the arguments of this subsection are easy modifications of arguments due to christ in 2 we have shown the following there exist x 0 rd rd 1 1 a set 1 and a symmetric positive definite linear transformation a a 1 quasi extremals 13 such that 1 det a b f 1 a b s 1 x 0 s 1 s 2 f where b is the unit ball and b 0 from the main lemma of 7 1 e deta 1 1 f s a df s 1 fs t dt ds deta 2 1 f s w dw ds after making the change of variables w a df s 1 fs t f s a df s 1 fs f s and using the fact that for s small det dfs or t or s 1 now for each s 1 and each 0 either f s w dt ds f s deta f s b 7 2 or f s b 0 f s 7 3 recalling 6 1 if we set c c 1 d 1 c c depending only on d then occurrence of 7 2 over a majority of 1 is impossible it would contradict the upper bound on e which results from quasi extremality hence 7 3 must hold for most s 1 refining 1 to a subset whose size is still we may assume that 7 3 holds for each s 1 unwinding the definition of f s we obtain that fs f s df s a 1 b 0 fs f s we also refine f s to a subset whose size is still and assume that fs f s df s a 1 b 0 8 proof of the main theorem by means of a rotation of rd 1 we may assume that a is diagonal with eigenvalues r 1 r 2 rd 1 by what we have proved so far one could prove theorem 2 1 without too much trouble with and the ri indicating the same quantities were it not for the non degeneracy condition 2 3 on the ri in the article 2 the special structure of the paraboloid meant that no such condition was necessary the primary work of this section and one of the main new details of this article will be to establish the necessity of that inequality 14 betsy stovall as e r and f r are allowed to be a factor of b larger than e and f resp if we can show that r 1 b 1 2 rd 1 then by enlarging the various parameters as needed for instance increasing the size of r 1 and proportionately to one another we may achieve the nondegeneracy con dition 2 3 while maintaining the other conditions we assume by way of contradiction that r 1 b 1 b 1 2 rd 1 8 1 with b b large positive constants yet to be determined in this section we will need to differentiate between two types of constants those over which we have control via our assumption 8 1 and those which we cannot substantially influence e g those appearing in the previous two sections we will denote the former by b b and the latter by c c while allowing the constants to vary from line to line as is typical in the harmonic analysis literature expressions such as will always involve implicit con stants of the second type though b will also be used to denote the unit ball we have otherwise exhausted letters a f and our meaning will be clear from the context 8 1 an alternative description of f s to simplify the exposition we assume that 0 if this were not the case it could be achieved by rotating the sphere and enlarging and the ri by a bounded factor we assume that s f 0 1 a b which implies that si ri 1 i d 1 from this df 0 s i j i j o rirj and df 0 s a 1 a 1 o therefore by the smallness of the ri df 0 s a 1 b 0 a 1 b 0 c for some constant c independent of and the ri henceforth we will ignore this constant we suppose that t f s then ti 1 t 2 si 1 s 2 ri 1 i d 1 by our assumption 8 1 as well as the assumptions 1 and r 1 rd 1 1 there exists an index k 1 k d 1 such that rk 1 2 rk 1 8 2 we let t ti tii rk rd k 1 we will show that t can be approximated by ti 1 ti 2 sii in the sense that for i k ti si 1 ti 2 o ri quasi extremals 15 if k 1 i d 1 then ti si 1 ti 2 ti si 1 t 2 1 s 2 si 1 t 2 1 s 2 1 ti 2 the first summand on the right is o ri which is acceptable the second summand is ri ti 2 s 2 t 2 ti 2 s 2 ri sii 2 1 ti 2 tii 2 o because si 2 o we continue ignoring the o term the right side is ri d 1 j k 1 tj sj 1 ti 2 tj sj 1 ti 2 ri d 1 j k 1 rj tj sj 1 ti 2 since rj rj when k 1 j d 1 we then have that d 1 i k 1 ti si 1 ti 2 d 1 i k 1 ri d 1 i k 1 ri d 1 j k 1 rj tj sj 1 ti 2 which by the monotonicity and smallness of the ri implies that tk 1 sk 1 1 ti 2 d 1 i k 1 ri d k 1 rk 1 the other inequalities can be established by induction and the assumption that ri 1 i d 1 8 2 a few lower bounds we define b s s 2 sd 1 rd 2 si ri 2 i d 1 then 1 b s 1 r s 1 s 1 ds r 2 rd 1 avgs b s 1 s 1 s 1 dividing both sides by r 2 rd 1 and using the fact that c deta cr 1 rd 1 we must then have that c r 1 avgs b s 1 s 1 s 1 say sd 1 is good if there exists s 2 sd 2 rd 3 such that s s 2 sd 1 b and s 1 s 1 s 1 cr 1 then we may choose c and the implicit constant large enough that sd 1 sd 1 is good crd 1 16 betsy stovall given s 1 we know that fs f s is contained in a 1 b 0 by our assumption 8 1 there exists k 1 k d 2 so that rk 1 2 rk 1 arguing as above we may assume that t f s satisfies fs t j c rj 1 j k where the index j indicates the component while maintaining the lower bound f s these assumptions on c and f s will be in force for the remainder of this section 8 3 more slicing let b be as defined above and let s b we define s s 1 t rd s s 1 s 1 and t f s and e s t 1 t 2 s 1 s 2 s 1 t s we have established in 7 1 that s 1 t 7 t 1 t 2 s 1 s 2 is sufficiently injective that e s s detd s 1 t dt ds 1 moreover this is equal to s fs t 1 dt ds 1 and is bounded from below by a constant times cr 1 r 1 c whenever s satisfies cr 1 s 1 s 1 s 1 8 3 by the work of the previous subsection the set of such admissible s s has size c b we return to 7 2 for the definition of which enables us to conclude that e s c d d 1 1 d 1 again for s satisfying 8 3 quasi extremals 17 8 4 a disjointness property we will prove in this section that the sets e s 1 and e s 2 are disjoint when s 1 and s 2 are sufficiently far apart when combined with our lower bound on e s this will give us a stronger lower bound on e as we also have the upper bound e c 1 d 1 d d 1 from the assumption of quasi extremality we will be able to obtain a contra diction and establish the necessity of 2 3 we know from 8 1 that if s 1 and t f s implies that ti ri 1 i k ti si 1 ti 2 ri k 1 i d 1 therefore t f s implies that tii 2 sii 2 1 ti 2 d 1 k 1 ri ri ri let x e s write x s 1 s 2 t 1 t 2 where t f s then xi ri 1 i k xi si 1 xi 2 1 ri k 1 i d 1 xd 1 sii 2 1 xi 2 1 all of these inequalities are independent of s 1 t so they describe arbitrary x e s since we are also assuming that t f s implies that ti si c ri 1 i k x e s also satisfies c ri xi 1 i k therefore if x e s 1 e s 2 then 1 1 xi 2 s 1 i s 2 i ri i k 8 4 we are assuming that xi c r 1 recall that the rj are monotone 1 1 xi 2 c r 1 and hence by 8 4 s 1 i s 2 i c r 2 1 ri i k on the other hand by the work of 8 2 we may choose a sequence s 1 s n with n 1 so that for each j s s j satisfies 8 3 and such that whenever 18 betsy stovall i 6 j s i s j c n rd 1 our assumption 8 1 implies that rd 1 b b r 21 rd 1 we fix n large enough for later purposes and choose b b to be sufficiently large that b c n b c having done this we ensure that the sets e s j are pairwise disjoint and thus that the size of their union is n j 1 e s j n j 1 e s j n c the above union is contained in e therefore for n sufficiently large de pending only on c and thus ultimately on d the above implies a contradiction to the upper bound 6 1 on e 8 5 conclusion of proof now we complete the proof of the main theorem from what we have seen so far there exist r 1 rd 1 0 satisfying conditions 2 1 2 3 such that r 1 rd 1 c r 1 rd 1 c where c c 1 d 1 1 d 1 for some large independent constants c c from these one immediately obtains the upper bounds e r c e and f r c f moreover by relaxing our assumptions on the size of the i to 1 s 1 f s s t 2 g s t u rd 1 s t u 3 we may assume that 1 s f 0 s i ri 1 i d 1 f s t fs t i ri 1 i d 1 g s t u ft u i ri 1 i d 1 quasi extremals 19 from this and our definition of the i we have that s 1 x 0 s 1 s 2 f f r x 0 s t 2 x 0 s 1 s

t we finally have the lower bound t e f e d 1 d 1 t e f and the theorem is proved 9 proof of theorem 2 2 by means of rotations and translations in proving theorem 2 2 it suffices to consider the following situation e f is an quasi extremal pair r satisfy inequalities 2 1 2 3 e e e r and f f f r and t e f c 1 d 1 d 1 t e f e r c e and f r c f we may further assume that 1 and ri 1 our strategy will be a typical one in harmonic analysis we will divide e r and f r into c pairs of quasi extremal sets ej fj of the correct size ej e and fj f and then use the pigeon hole principle to pick one pair so that t ej fj ct e f we will begin with an initial decomposition of e r we choose c 1 so that d e r e and f r f since 1 inequalities 2 1 2 3 still hold we write e r 1 i 1 e r i ed we further decompose e r as e r o d 1 j 1 bje r 20 betsy stovall where bj is the affine transformation bj x rj x ed ed and rj is the rotation which takes the point xj sd 1 e r ed to ed takes ed to xj 1 x j d 1 x j d and fixes all points perpendicular to ed and x j thus e r 1 i 1 o d 1 j 1 bje r i ed 1 i 1 o d 1 j 1 ei j next for each i and j we will decompose f r into a union of sets compatible with ei j this will be surprisingly easy we note here that the set f r has the same dimensions as f r in the directions perpendicular to ed but has thickness rather than in the ed direction first we wish to know with which portion of f r an element of ei j interacts via convolution with the sphere let bi j be the affine transformation defined by bi j x bj x i ed so that ei j bi je r it now suffices to determine which elements of b 1 i j f r are a distance 1 from elements of e r one can check for instance by explicitly computing b 1 i j y for y f r that b 1 i j f r f r c for some constant c depending on the dimension now by increasing as needed it is sufficient to determine with which elements of f r lie a distance 1 from a point in e r write x e r and y f r c as x x 1 x 2 1 1 y y 1 y 2 2 where xi ri yi ri 1 and 2 if we assume that x y 1 then 1 x 2 y 2 xd yd 2 o x 2 y 2 1 x 2 1 1 y 2 2 2 2 1 x 2 1 1 y 2 22 o next one applies the inequality 1 1 x 2 x 2 r 2 d 1 so 2 1 1 x 2 1 1 y 2 r 2 d 1 2 r 21 2 1 1 x 2 rd 1 using these inequalities in the series of equalities above 2 2 1 y 2 22 o quasi extremals 21 which implies that 2 the computations in the paragraph above imply that t e r f r t e r f r c therefore t e f 1 i 1 o d 1 j 1 t e bi je r f f r 1 i 1 o d 1 j 1 t e bi je r f bi jf r c 1 i 1 o d 1 j 1 t e bi je r c f bi jf r c by the pigeonhole principle there exists some choice of i j so that t e f t e f ct e bi je r c f bi jf r c and the theorem 2 2 is proved references 1 m christ lp bounds for generalized radon transforms preprint 2 m christ quasi extremals for a radon like
