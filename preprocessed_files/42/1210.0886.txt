carleson s theorem on pointwise convergence of fourier series 1 introduction let snf x n k n f k e 2 ikx be the partial fourier series of the l 1 function f on 0 1 in 1966 lennart carleson has proved the following long standing conjecture theorem 1 1 5 for each f l 2 0 1 the fourier series snf converge almost everywhere to f soon after that a slight modification of carleson s method allowed hunt 11 to extend the result to lp functions for p 1 theorem 1 1 has since received many proofs most notably by fefferman 10 and by lacey and thiele 13 the impact of carleson s theorem has increased in recent years thanks to its connections with scattering theory 19 egodic theory 7 8 the theory of directional singular integrals in the plane 15 16 6 9 1 2 and the theory of operators with quadratic modulations 17 18 a more detailed description can be found in 12 these connections have motivated the discovery of various new arguments for theorem 1 1 while these arguments share some similarities each of them has a distinct personality along these lines it is interesting to note that for almost every specific application of carleson s theorem in the aforementioned fields only one of the arguments will do the job all the arguments for theorem 1 1 are technical to present the main ideas in a transparent way we will instead analyze the closely related walsh fourier series which we recall below for n 0 the n th walsh function wn is defined recursively by the formula w 0 1 0 1 w 2 n wn 2 x wn 2 x 1 w 2 n 1 wn 2 x wn 2 x 1 2010 mathematics subject classification primary 42 a 20

series of f swn f x n k 0 f wk wk x the following theorem was proved by billard by adapting carleson s methods theorem 1 2 4 for each 1 p and each f lp 0 1 the series swn f x converges almost everywhere to f x we present a few proofs of theorem 1 2 which are translations of their fourier ana logues in each case the translation can be done in more than one way the proofs presented reflect author s taste while a few of the features of the original proofs from the fourier case will be lost in translation the main line of thought will be preserved essentially intact in the walsh case very little originality is claimed by the author this paper is by no means a complete guide to carleson s theorem in particular we shall make no attempt to describe in detail any of its afore mentioned applications the main goal is to give a self contained but concise survey of some of the main arguments in the literature acknowledgements the author would like to thank christoph thiele for clarifying discussions on the argument from 18 and to fangye shi for carefully reading the original manuscript and pointing out a few typos part of the material in this paper was organized while teaching a class on harmonic analysis many thanks to ben krause for a careful reading and for pointing out a few inaccuracies the author is grateful to his students francesco di plinio and prabath silva for motivating him and to his collaborators for enriching his understanding of time frequency analysis 2 the walsh phase plane it turns out that there is a multiscale description for swn f let d denote the collection of all dyadic intervals which are subsets of r 0 we call r r the walsh phase plane definition 2 1 a tile p ip p is a rectangle of area one such that ip p d a bitile p ip p is a rectangle of area two such that ip p d let pl pu be the left or lower and right or upper halves of p we will denote by pl ip pl and pu ip pu the lower and upper tiles of p we denote by pall the collection of all bitiles given a tile p 2 jm 2 j m 1 2 jn 2 j n 1 we define the associated walsh wave packet wp x 2 j 2 wn 2 jx m to understand the relevance of the walsh phase plane we recall a few tools from 22 see also 21 every x r 0 can be identified uniquely with a doubly infinite set of binary digits an an x such that x n z an 2 n a guide to carleson s theorem 3 where an 0 1 and lim infn an 0 note that an is eventually zero as n we define two operations on r first x y n bn 2 n where bn an x an y mod 2 we caution the reader that bn is not always the same as an x y as the example x n 0 n odd 2 n y n 0 n even 2 n shows also since 1 x y x z where z 1 n 0 n odd 2 n r is not strictly speaking a group we will be content with observing that for all practical purposes r can be thought of as being a group in the sense that behaves like a genuine group operation if we exclude pairs x y of zero product lebesgue measure define the second operation by x y n cn 2 n where cn m z am x an m y mod 2 we note that this sum is always finite if we neglect zero measure sets r can be thought of as being a field with characteristic two it will be implicitly assumed that various equalities to follow hold outside zero measure sets define the function ew r 1 1 such that ew x 1 when a 1 x 0 and ew x 1 when a 1 x 1 this 1 periodic function is the walsh analogue of e 2 ix it is easy to check that wn x ew x n 1 0 1 x thus wn can be thought of as being the walsh analogue of e 2 inx also for each tile p ip p we have wp x 1 ip 1 2 w 0 x l ip ip ew x l p where l j denotes the left endpoint of j a simple computation shows that for each bitile p wpl x wpu x eip x 1 where ei x 1 on il and ei x 1 on ir the collection of all wave packets wp where p ranges over all tiles with fixed scale forms a complete orthonormal system in l 2 r and thus f p ip 2 j f wp wp we introduce the walsh also called walsh fourier transform of a function f r c to be fwf f e x f x dx it is easy to see that its inverse f 1 w coincides with fw 4 ciprian demeter arguably the most important feature that makes the walsh phase plane technically simpler than its fourier counterpart is the absence of the strong form of the uncertainty principle this allows the existence of functions compactly supported in both time and frequency the best example is 1 0 1 which equals its walsh transform a quick computation shows that for each interval i d 1 i i 1 0 i 1 e xi 2 where xi is an arbitrary element of i similarly w p 1 p 1 2 w 0 l p p ew l ip thus wp is spatially supported in ip while its walsh transform is supported in p an application of plancherel s theorem shows that wp wp 0 3 whenever the tiles p and p do not intersect the following partial relation of order was introduced by c fefferman 10 definition 2 2 order for two tiles or bitiles p p we write p p if ip ip and p p note that p and p are comparable under if and only if they intersect as sets we will refer to maximal or minimal tiles or bitiles with respect to as simply being maximal or minimal definition 2 3 convexity a collection p of bitiles is called convex if whenever p p p p pall and p p p we must also have p p for a collection p of tiles or bitiles we denote by a p p p ip p the region in r 2 covered by them we will use the fact see lemma 2 5 in 22 that for each convex set of bitiles p the region a p can be written not necessarily in a unique way as a disjoint union of tiles p a p a p 4 we can identify any region in the walsh phase plane which is a finite union of pairwise disjoint tiles p p with the subspace of l 2 r spanned by wp p p indeed it turns out that if two such collections p and p of tiles cover the same area in the phase plane then wp p p and wp p p span the same vector space in l 2 r see corollary 2 7 in 22 in particular p p f wp wp x p p f wp wp x 5 the projection operator onto this subspace pf x p p f wp wp x a guide to carleson s theorem 5 will be referred to as the phase space projection onto p 3 guarantees that wp p p forms an orthonormal basis of the range of p in particular if p is a convex union of bitiles and p satisfies 4 then we abuse notation and define pf pf an easy induction argument proves lemma 2 4 corollary 2 4 22 let p p be a finite collections of pairwise disjoint tiles such that a p a p then there exists a collection p of pairwise disjoint tiles which includes all the tiles in p such that a p a p lemma 2 4 and 3 will imply that for each convex collection p of bitiles and for each p p f wp pf wp p pu pl 6 remark 2 5 we mention that the relation of order as well as concepts such as convexity and phase space projections can be extended naturally to the two or higher dimensional case this will be explored in section 8 fix now n 0 note that swn f x pnf x where pn is the collection of the tiles 0 1 k k 1 0 k n we will partition a pn 0 1 0 n 1 in a different way namely for each point x 0 1 0 n 1 there exists a unique bitile p such that x pl and x n 1 pu this bitile is precisely the minimal one such that n 1 p and x ip note that the tiles pl corresponding to all these p will partition 0 1 0 n 1 but then 5 will imply that swn f x p pall n 1 pu f wpl wpl x in particular sup n 0 swn f x p pall f wpl wpl x 1 pu n x for a suitable function n r n the roles of pu and pl can be interchanged without altering the nature or the difficulty for pedagogical reasons we choose to work with the model sums cpf x p p f wpu wpu x 1 pl n x where p pall and f r c using the standard approximation argument combined with the almost everywhere convergence of swn f x for characteristic functions of intervals theorem 1 2 will follow from the following inequality theorem 2 6 we have for each 1 p n r r and f lp r cpallf p cp f p the constant cp does not depend on f and n note that to recover theorem 1 2 we could restrict attention to functions f on 0 1 and to the bitiles spatially supported in 0 1 we will do so in some but not all the proofs to follow we will always allow the choice function n to take any value in r not just integers 6 ciprian demeter 3 estimates for a single tree throughout the paper we will denote by mf the hardy littlewood maximal function of f the various implicit constants hidden in the notation will typically be allowed to depend on the ho lder exponents p pi si etc fefferman 10 organized the bitiles in structures that he named trees and forests the restriction ct to a tree will be a caldero n zygmund object which can be investigated with classical methods the contribution of forests is controlled by using various forms of orthogonality between the tree operators ct all the approaches described in the following sections will rely on this strategy definition 3 1 let it d and t r n 2 k n k z a tree t with top data it t is a collection of bitiles such that ip it and t p for each p t if pt pall is such that p pt for each p t we call pt a top bitile for t note that such a pt is not unique and t need not contain a top bitile a tree is called overlapping if the tiles pu p t intersect a tree is called lacunary if the tiles pl p t intersect each tree can be decomposed as t tl to where tl p t t pl to p t t pu note that tl is lacunary while to is overlapping moreover if t is convex then so are the trees tl and to these observations will allow us to always assume the tree we deal with is either overlapping or lacunary the classical example of lacunary tree is the littlewood paley tree consisting of all bitiles of the form p i i 0 i 1 i d note that for each p i in the littlewood paley tree we have wp iu x hi x where hi is the l 2 normalized haar function equal to i 1 2 on the left half il and to i 1 2 on the right half iu recall that if i is a subset of the littlewood paley tree we have p i i f hi hi p f p 1 p 7 for a lacunary tree t we denote otf x p t f wpu wpu x we have the following generalization of 7 lemma 3 2 single tree estimate singular integral let t be a lacunary tree then for each 1 p otf p f p proof recall that w pu is supported in pu call the collection of all intervals pu p t and note that they are pairwise disjoint and sit within distance smaller than their length a guide to carleson s theorem 7 from t by the walsh version of the littlewood paley theorem applied to otf and then to f we have otf p f 1 w 1 fw otf 2 1 2 p p t pu f wpu wpu 2 1 2 p p t f wpu 2 ip 1 ip 1 2 p f p the next lemma shows that the operator ct restricted to an tree t is a maximal function if t is overlapping and a maximal truncation of a discrete caldero n zygmund operator if t is lacunary lemma 3 3 single tree estimate maximal truncations let t be a tree then for each 1 p p t f wpu wpu x 1 pl n x lp r f p proof it suffices to prove the lemma when t is either lacunary or overlapping we start with the lacunary case note that for each x there is k k x such that p t f wpu wpu x 1 pl n x p t p 2 k f wpu wpu x note that if p p t and p p then pu is disjoint from and sits at the right of p u thus there will exist an interval x which contains all pu with p 2 k and which will have empty intersection with all pu satisfying p 2 k we can thus write p t p 2 k f wpu wpu x f 1 w 1 fw otf x using 2 and the fact that x 0 1 is an interval of length 1 containing x we get p t p 2 k f wpu wpu x x 0 1 otf y dy m otf x it now suffices to apply lemma 3 2 assume next that t is overlapping this case is immediate by noting that for each x p t f wpu wpu x 1 pl n x f wpu wpu x m f x where p is the unique possibly nonexisting bitile with x n x pl we remark that 6 implies that whenever t is convex and p t we have f wpu tf wpu thus the result of lemma 3 3 can also be written in a localized form ctf p tf p 8 we close this section with proving lp estimates for the phase space projection associated with a tree 8 ciprian demeter proposition 3 4 for each convex tree t and each 1 p tf p f p proof we first observe that for each x it t f x pf x where p is the minimal bitile in t with x ip indeed according to lemma 2 4 there exists a collection p of pairwise disjoint tiles which includes pu and pl such that tf x pf x p p pu pl pf x but p is minimal hence x ip ip for each p p pu pl finally note that for each bitile p and each x ip we have pf x ip 1 2 f wpu f wpl 2 ip ip f mf x 4 size and pointwise estimates outside exceptional sets we are now ready to see the first proof of theorem 2 6 this argument bears some resemblance to the original argument of carleson 5 a form of this argument has been used in 19 in the walsh case while the proof of the fourier case is hidden in 7 this type of argument proved instrumental in applications to the return times theorem 7 and the directional hilbert transform in the plane 9 the main tool is the size of a collection of bitiles a concept introduced by lacey and thiele 14 in the fourier case and by thiele 1 22 in the walsh case definition 4 1 the size of a collection p of bitiles with respect to a function f r c is defined as sizef p sup p p pf 2 ip 1 2 the next two propositions record some of the key features of sizef p proposition 4 2 let t be a convex tree then for each 1 p tf p sizef t it 1 p 9 proof it suffices to prove that tf sizef t the proof of proposition 3 4 shows that for each x it tf x pf x where p is the minimal bitile in t with x ip to close the argument observe that for each bitile p we have pf ip 1 2 f wpu f wpl ip 1 2 2 f wpu 2 f wpl 2 1 2 ip 1 2 2 pf 2 proposition 4 3 for each p and f r c sizef p sup p p inf x ip m f x 1 it is there referred to as density a guide to carleson s theorem 9 proof this is immediate since for each p pf 2 f wpu 2 f wpl 2 1 2 2 ip 1 2 ip f definition 4 4 a forest f is a finite collection of bitiles which consists of a disjoint union of convex trees we note that each finite convex collection p of bitiles can be turned into a forest possibly in more than one way indeed start with a maximal element p from p and construct the maximal tree in p with top bitile p remove this tree t from p and note that p t remains convex repeat the procedure with p t replacing p to select the next tree iterate this until all the bitiles from the original p are selected we will sometimes use the notation nf for the counting function of a forest f nf x t f 1 it x a key idea in many of the approaches to carleson s theorem is to split the bitiles into forests with a certain size lemma 4 5 let p be a finite convex collection of bitiles and let f r c then p phi plo such that both plo and phi are convex sizef plo 12 sizef p phi is a convex forest with trees t f satisfying t f it sizef p 2 f 22 proof this is a recursive procedure set pstock p and f select a maximal bitile t pstock such that tf 2 it 1 2 sizef p 2 define t t p pstock p t and note that since pstock is convex both pstock t t and the tree t t will be convex add t t to the family f reset pstock pstock t t and restart the procedure the algorithm is over when there is no t to be selected then define phi to consist of the union of all bitiles in all the trees from f and let plo p phi the first two needed properties as well as the convexity of f are quite immediate by maximality the selected bitiles t are pairwise disjoint and thus the functions tf are pairwise orthogonal thanks to 3 it follows that t f it t it 4 sizef p 2 t tf 22 4 sizef p 2 f 22 we can iterate the lemma to obtain 10 ciprian demeter proposition 4 6 size decomposition let p be a finite convex collection of bitiles then p 2 n sizef p pn pnull such that sizef pn 2 n pn is a convex forest with trees t fn satisfying t fn it 22 n f 22 10 pf 0 for each p pnull we are now ready for the main line of the argument proof of theorem 2 6 by using restricted type interpolation and a limiting argument it suffices to prove x cpf x 1 p e 11 for each e r with finite measure each f 1 e each finite convex p pall for each 1 4 p and also for each 0 1 1 p the implicit constant in the inequality 11 will only depend on p we start with the simpler case 1 4 p note that the bound sizef p 1 follows from proposition 4 3 let pn fn with 2 n 1 be the collections from proposition 4 6 for each t fn with top bitile pt t define the saturation t p pn p pt note that the trees t remain convex but in general they are not pairwise disjoint call f n the collection of the trees t and note that it it define the exceptional set f 2 n 1 t f n x ct f x 2 n 2 note that by 8 and 9 we have x ct f x 2 n 2 it 2 n 2 p combining this with 10 and p 4 we obtain f 1 p e thus it remains to prove that cpf x on f c the crucial observation behind this approach to theorem 2 6 is that for each n the contribution to each x comes from a single tree t f n indeed note that the contributing bitiles p pn satisfy x n x ip pl since all these bitiles p contain x n x they will be pairwise comparable under call px the unique maximal bitile among them let t x be one of the trees in f n containing px it follows that all the contributing bitiles belong to t x thus if x f cpnf x ct xf x 2 n 2 it further follows by linearity that cpf x 2 n 1 cpnf x the case 0 1 is very similar but we need an additional exceptional set g x m f x p a guide to carleson s theorem 11 since g 1 p e and since wpl is supported on ip it is enough to prove 11 with p restricted to those bitiles such that p 6 g another application of proposition 4 3 shows that sizef p p let pn fn with 2 n p be the collections from proposition 4 6 corresponding to our new p define f 2 n p t f n x ct f x 1 22 n 2 p as before 8 and 9 imply x ct f x 1 22 n 2 p it 2 n 1 22 n 2 p p p 1 we immediately get that f e 1 p e note also that if x f cpf x 2 n p cpnf x 2 n p 1 22 n 2 p 5 mass and fefferman s argument the argument in this section is a translation to the walsh case of fefferman s proof 10 the key tool used in this proof is mass definition 5 1 the mass of a convex collection p of bitiles is defined as mass p sup p p e p ip where e p ip n 1 p in some sense the mass of a single bitile p measures or better said it puts an upper bound on since pl p how much p contributes to cpf x indeed it suffices to note that for 1 p we have cpf p mass p 1 p f p we will next extend this inequality to the case of trees and then to a special type of forests we have the following analogue of lemma 4 5 we will restrict attention to the bitiles spatially supported in 0 1 p 0 1 p pall ip 0 1 lemma 5 2 let p be a finite convex collection of bitiles in p 0 1 then p phi plo such that both plo and phi are convex mass plo 12 mass p phi is a convex forest with trees t f satisfying t f it mass p 1 proof this is another recursive procedure set pstock p select a maximal bitile t pstock such that mass t mass p 2 12 ciprian demeter define t t p pstock p t and note that since pstock is convex both pstock t t and the tree t t will be convex add t t to the family f reset the new value pstock pstock t t and restart the procedure the algorithm is over when there is no t to be selected then define phi to consist of the union of all bitiles in all the trees from f and let plo p phi the first two needed properties as well as the convexity of f are quite immediate by maximality the selected bitiles t are pairwise disjoint and thus the sets e t will also be pairwise disjoint since e t 0 1 it follows that t f it t it 2 mass p 1 t e t 2 mass p 1 12 note that the mass of any collection is trivially bounded by 1 we can iterate the lemma to obtain the following analogue of proposition 4 6 proposition 5 3 mass decomposition let p p 0 1 be a finite convex collection of bitiles then p n 0 pn pnull such that mass pn 2 n pn is a convex forest with trees t fn satisfying t fn it 2 n cpf 0 for each p pnull and each f it turns out that we have not only l 1 but also dyadic bmo control for nfn recall that f bmo sup i dyadic 1 i i f x 1 i i f dx proposition 5 4 we have nfn bmo 2 n in particular for each i d and 0 x t fn it i 1 it x c 2 n e i where c is large enough proof one can easily check that nfn bmo sup i d t fn it i it i this combined with 12 will imply our first inequality the second one is just a consequence of john nirenberg s inequality a guide to carleson s theorem 13 given a convex tree t with top data t it define jt to be the collection of all maximal dyadic intervals j it such that j contains no ip with p t for j jt define gj j p t j ip e p we first observe that the intervals of jt form a partition of it note also that if j intersects some ip with p t then the convexity of t forces the dyadic parent of each j jt to equal ip j for some p j t thus gj e p j which implies the following crucial carleson measure type estimate gj 2 mass t j 13 for each j jt we also need to observe that ctf is supported on j jt gj proposition 5 5 tree estimate let t be a convex tree then for each 1 p ctf p mass t 1 p f p proof assume first that t is overlapping note that for each j jt and x j if ctf x is nonzero then ctf x 1 ip 1 2 f wpu for some p t with j ip thus ctf x infy j m f y we conclude that ctf x pdx j jt gj ctf x pdx j jt gj inf y j m f y p 2 mass t j jt j mf x pdx 2 mass t mf p lp it mass t f pp on the other hand if t is lacunary we reason like in the proof of lemma 3 3 to write ctf x f 1 w 1 fw otf x where the interval is any interval which contains all pu with x ip recall however that ip 2 j for all such p and hence since t pl all pu will be contained in the interval t t j 1 thus ctf x 1 j x 0 j otf y dy inf y j m otf y a repetition of the argument from the overlapping case combined with lemma 3 2 ends the proof the proof of this proposition shows that for each j jt ctf l j inf x j m vt f x 14 where vtf tf if t is overlapping and vtf ot tf is t is lacunary definition 5 6 we call f a fefferman forest if two bitiles from any two distinct trees in f are pairwise disjoint it turns out that outside a small exceptional set each forest f can be written as a disjoint union of a small number of fefferman forests 14 ciprian demeter lemma 5 7 the fefferman trick assume p is a convex set in p 0 1 which is organized as a forest f satisfying nf bmo 2 n and nf l 1 2 n then for each k 1 there is an exceptional set f with f e k such that t f it 6 f 1 it k 2 n 15 the bitiles in pf t f it 6 f p p t can be partitioned into o log k 2 n fefferman forests proof define f x t f 1 it x ck 2 n for large enough c note that f e k by john nirenberg s inequality call ff t f it 6 f then 15 is immediate let pt be any top bitile for t define for each l n with 1 2 l ck 2 n p l f p pf 2 l t ff p pt 2 l 1 it remains to prove that plf is a fefferman forest note that p l f is convex in part because p is convex for each maximal element t plf let t t p plf p t obviously each tree t t is convex assume for contradiction p p for some p t t p t t with t 6 t then p t in addition to p t thus it intersects it but then since t and t are pairwise incomparable under the sets t ff t pt and t ff t pt must be pairwise disjoint note that t ff t pt t ff t pt t ff p pt and this will force the contradiction 2 l 2 l 2 l 1 we will repeatedly use the fact that if t t are trees in a fefferman forest then ctf and ct f are disjointly supported while tf and t f are orthogonal proposition 5 8 forest estimate let f be a fefferman forest then for each 1 p there exists p 1 p such that cff p mass f 1 p nf p f p when p 2 we can take p 0 proof let first p 2 consider the vector valued operator v f tf t f proposition 3 4 shows that v l l l 1 on the other hand the pairwise orthogonality of tf implies the bound v l 2 l 2 l 2 1 interpolation 3 now gives v lp lp lp 1 16 using proposition 5 5 we get cff pp t f ctf pp t f mass t tf pp mass f f pp a guide to carleson s theorem 15 assume next that p 2 split f into nf forests fk so that for each k and each t t fk we have it it note that we have as before cff pp k t fk ctf pp k t fk mass t f 1 it pp mass f k f pp mass f nf f pp to close the argument interpolate the lp and l 2 bounds for the operator f 7 cff we are now ready to prove the following variant of theorem 2 6 note that this weaker version is enough to prove theorem 1 2 via the standard approximation argument then in the case 1 p 2 one can actually use stein s continuity principle 20 to show that theorem 1 2 implies the stronger theorem 2 6 the author is not aware of any substitute argument which proves the same implication for p 2 however in section 7 we present a recent delicate refinement of fefferman s argument due to lie 18 which closes this gap theorem 5 9 for each 1 q p we have cp 0 1 f q f p proof by invoking a limiting argument it suffices to prove the estimate with p 0 1 replaced by a finite convex collection p p 0 1 as long as the implicit constant in the inequality is independent of p apply proposition 5 3 to p to get pn fn apply lemma 5 7 to each fn withk kn n 1 l l 2 to be determined later we get exceptional sets fn e l n 1 and the partitions of ffn n t fn it 6 fn into o n logl fefferman forests fn k define f nfn and note that f e l let also p be the bitiles in the trees from nffn n note that cpf x cp f x on f c by proposition 5 8 and linearity we get cpf lp f c n k cfn kf lp 0 1 n 2 n p n logl n 2 nl p f p l 1 p f p thus for each 1 x 0 1 cpf x l f p p e l by optimizing l we get that for each s p x 0 1 cpf x f p s a simple integration argument finishes the proof of the theorem 6 combining mass and size the lacey thiele argument the fourier version of this argument is due to lacey and thiele 13 it uses both mass and size and thus it combines elements of the two proofs we have seen in earlier sections the interplay between mass and size made this approach particularly well suited for applications to the problem of singular integrals along vector fields 15 1 2 since it opened the door to the use of kakeya type maximal functions 16 ciprian demeter the definition of size p will remain the same as in section 4 let f be a finite measure subset of r we modify slightly the definition of mass definition 6 1 the mass of a convex collection p of bitiles relative to f is defined as massf p sup p p ef p ip where now ef p f ip n 1 p we have the following version of proposition 5 3 proposition 6 2 mass decomposition let p pall be a finite convex collection of bitiles then p m 0 p m p null such that massf p m 2 m p m is a convex forest with trees t f m satisfying t f m it 2 m f cpf 0 for each p p null and each f r c proposition 6 3 tree estimate let t be a convex tree then for each f l 2 r ctf 1 f it massf t sizef t proof for j jt define as before gj j p t j ip ef p recall that ctf 1 f restricted to j is supported on gj we then estimate like in the proof of proposition 5 5 ctf 1 f j jt gj ctf massf t j jt j m vt f massf t j jt j 1 2 j m vt f 2 1 2 massf t it 1 2 vt f 2 where vtf tf if t is overlapping and vt ot tf is t is lacunary the result now follows from 9 and lemma 3 2 proof of theorem 2 6 by using restricted type interpolation and a limiting argument it suffices to prove that given 1 p p 6 2 with dual exponent p and given finite measure subsets e g of r there exists f g with f g 2 such that cpf 1 f e 1 p f 1 p 17 for each f 1 e and each finite convex p pall we analyze first the case p 2 when we can take f g note that sizef p 1 apply to p propositions 4 6 and 6 2 to get pn p m fn f m for m 0 and 2 n 1 define pn m pn p m we organize the bitiles in pn m into a forest in two different way call a guide to carleson s theorem 17 fn m the trees t p m with t fn and call f n m the trees t pn with t f m note that the resulting trees are convex and t fn m it 22 n e t f n m it 2 m f thus using proposition 6 3

and using interpolation moreover as observed in section 5 fefferman s argument does not imply strong type lp bounds for the operator cp 0 1 when p 2 the recent argument of lie 18 proves that cp 0 1 f p f lp 0 1 18 directly without any interpolation that restricts f to special classes of functions such as sub characteristic the case p 2 will require no interpolation in the argument while the case p 6 2 will rely on vector valued interpolation for various operators relevant to the proof we will restrict attention to p 2 this argument while also interesting in itself has been developed in 18 in order to solve a conjecture of stein on the boundedness of the quadratic carleson operator we will keep the notation for mass from section 5 and will restrict attention to the bitiles in p 0 1 recall see lemma 5 7 that fefferman s approach consisted of decomposing every forest into a small number of fefferman forests outside a small exceptional set the lemma below shows how to iterate the fefferman trick inside the exceptional set until all 18 ciprian demeter bitiles are exhausted each stage of the iteration creates more layers of fefferman forests but the size of their spatial support will get exponentially smaller lemma 7 1 let p p 0 1 be a finite convex collection of bitiles then we have the following partitions p k 0 pk 19 pk m 1 q m k 20 q m k 1 n k fm nk 21 where each fm nk is a fefferman forest such that nfm n k k 2 k 22 and mass p k 1 i 0 pi 21 k 23 moreover there are sets emk m k 0 which are finite disjoint unions j m k of dyadic intervals such that em 1 k emk and em 1 k j e 10 k j for j jmk 24 p qm 1 k implies ip emk ip 6 em 1 k 25 p qm 1 k implies ip em 2 k e 10 k ip 26 proof set p 0 assume that given k 0 each pi has been defined for each 0 i k 1 so that it satisfies 20 26 let us see how to define pk for the rest of the argument set pstock p 0 i k 1 pi let p 0 k max be the maximal bitiles in the set p pstock mass p 2 k define e 0 k 0 1 p 0 k p pstock p p for some p p 0 k max n 0 k x p p 0 k max 1 ip x and the exceptional set e 1 k x n 0 k x c 1 k 2 k where c 1 is a large enough constant to be determined later note that since the sets ep are pairwise disjoint for p p 0 k max it follows that n 0 k bmo 2 k this and john nirenbeg in turn imply 24 for m 0 define q 1 k p p 0 k ip 6 e 1 k a guide to carleson s theorem 19 and note that 25 holds for m 0 we continue the construction of the sets emk q m k inductively fix m 0 1 assume e 0 k e m 0 k and q 1 k q m 0 k have been constructed so that 24 25 hold for each 0 m m 0 1 and so that 26 holds for each m m 0 2 define pm 0 k max to be the maximal bitiles in the set p pstock ip em 0 k mass p 2 k let also p m 0 k p pstock p p for some p p m 0 k max nm 0 k x p p m 0 k max 1 ip x and the exceptional

0 k we have that either ip e m 0 k or ip em 0 k is a finite disjoint union of dyadic intervals j j m 0 k note that john nirenberg s inequality guarantees that for each j jm 0 k we have j em 0 1 k e 10 k j which immediately implies 26 for m m 0 1 it is easy to see that each qmk is convex it can be organized into a forest of trees with tops in p pm 1 k max ip 6 emk note that the counting function has a favorable l bound p p m 1 k max ip 6 e m k 1 ip c 1 k 2 k the forests fm nk are now obtained via the fefferman trick it is immediate that the collections qmk are pairwise disjoint for fixed k because of 25 note that the algorithm for fixed k will end with a finite value of m we set qmk to be empty for all larger values of m and define pk m 1 q m k finally observe that when the algorithm for fixed k is over there can not be any p left in pstock pk with mass p 2 k indeed note that ip e 0 k trivially while ip emk the algorithm will continue to run but by 24 there should exist m such that ip emk ip 6 em 1 k thus if mass p 2 k then p gets automatically selected in qm 1 k a distinct feature of the approach in this section is the almost orthogonality between a function with small support and a function locally constant on this support lemma 7 2 almost orthogonality let j be a collection of pairwise disjoint intervals and let f j jj c such that f is constant on each j j assume ej j satisfies ej j for each j j then for each g j jej c we have f g 1 2 f 2 g 2 20 ciprian demeter proof f g j ej f g j ej 1 2 sup x j f x g l 2 j 1 2 j f l 2 j g l 2 j 1 2 f 2 g 2 proposition 7 3 almost orthogonality between forests fix k for each m 0 let fm denote one of the forests fm nk from lemma 7 1 define fmf t fm tf then for each m m 2 fmf fm f e m m 2 k 2 f 22 proof note that due to 22 we can split fm into layers fm l k 2 k fm l so that for each l the trees t in fm l have pairwise disjoint intervals it arguing like in the proof of proposition 3 4 we first observe that for each x we have t fm l tf x pf x where p is the minimal bitile in t fm l t such that x ip second by 25 for each interval j jmk and each p t fm l t j can not contain either the right or the left halves of ip third 1 guarantees that each pf is constant on both the right and the left halves of ip we now conclude that the function t fm l tf is constant on each j jmk applying lemma 7 2 to t fm l tf 1 emk and fm f by virtue of 24 we get fmf fm f l fm l f fm f k 2 ke 10 m m 1 k 2 fm f 2 fmf 2 e m m 2 k 2 f 22 lemma 7 4 schur s test let tm be a sequence of operators on l 2 0 1 with adjoints t m such that for

the restriction p 2 m 1 mp in the summation can be achieved by splitting the integers 22 ciprian demeter in classes of residues modulo p 2 and using the triangle inequality this separation will be used to achieve extra decay for each t fm 1 let as before jt be the collection of all maximal dyadic intervals j it such that j contains no ip with p t denote by st the support p t ip n 1 p of ctf

boundedness of the carleson operator which makes no mention of it the proof of theorem 8 1 is very close in spirit to the proof of the boundedness of the walsh model of the bilinear hilbert transform

which by abusing earlier notation will be denoted by the reader can correctly an ticipate that p p will stand for rp rp and p p convexity on p 3 2 all will be understood with respect to this order definition 8 4 let rt d 2 be a dyadic square and let t r a 32 tree t with top data rt t is a collection of 3 2 bitiles in p 3 2 all such that rp rt and t p for each p t with each 3 2 bitile p we will identify two regions in the phase space r 4 r 2 r 2 one is the region covered by the two dimensional bitile rp 0 p p the other one is rp p r which is the union of two dimensional bitiles of the form rp p we will denote by cp the collection of all these two dimensional bitiles it is easy to check that if p p 3 2 all is convex then both collections of bitiles rp 0 p p p p and p pcp are convex with respect to the two dimensional order we will denote by 2 pf and 3 2 p f the phase space projections associated with the two collections cf remark 2 5 26 ciprian demeter note that 3 2 p f can be thought of as being a one and a half dimensional projection since this operator produces no localization on the second frequency component for example if p is a 3 2 tile then 3 2 p f x y f x y wip p x

proof the crucial observation in both cases is that itf x y i pf x y 34 for each i 3 2 2 where p is minimal 3 2 bitile in t such that x y rp this follows like in the proof of proposition 3 4 the first inequality then follows by noting that 2 pf 2 pf 2 like in the one dimensional case let us now analyze the second inequality let pt be the collection of all 3 2 bitiles in t such that for each p pt there is x y such that p is the minimal 32 bitile in t with x y rp it is easy to see that p pt rp rt 35 a guide to carleson s theorem 27 indeed if p pt by the convexity of t at least one of the four dyadic children of rp will contain no rp with p pt next we observe that for each 3 2 bitile p 3 2 p f f 36 which together with ho lder s inequality gives if f 1 and 2 p 3 2 p f p rp 1 p sizef 3 2 p 2
