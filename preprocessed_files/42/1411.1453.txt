estimates for the wave equation in do mains with a strictly concave boundary when homogeneous dirichlet or neu mann conditions are imposed by restricting the solution to small frequency dependent space time collars of the boundary it is seen that a stronger gain in regularity can be obtained relative to the usual energy estimates mixed norm estimates of strichartz and square function type follow as a result using the energy estimates to control error terms which arise in a wave packet parametrix construction while the latter estimates are not new for dirichlet conditions the present approach provides an avenue for treating these estimates when neumann conditions are imposed the method also treats schro dinger equa tions with time independent coefficients 1 introduction let m g be a c riemannian manifold of dimension n 2 with compact strictly geodesically concave boundary and g the nonnegative dirichlet or neu mann laplacian suppose u v 1 1 m c are solutions to the wave and schro dinger equations d 2 t g u t x 0 u tu t 0 f g 1 1 dt g v t x 0 v t 0 f 1 2 with dt i t subject to either homogeneous dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions 1 3 u t x x m 0 or nu t x x m 0 wheren is a normal vector field along and u can be replaced by v as appropriate we are concerned with establishing local strichartz estimates for these solutions with p q 2 u lp 1 1 lq m c f h m g h 1

operator see for example the concluding comments in bss 12 1 in particular we are interested the author was supported in part by the national science foundation grants dms 1301717 and dms 1001529 1 http arxiv org abs 1411 1453 v 1 2 m d blair in scale invariant estimates ones where the regularity on the right hand side is the optimal regularity predicted by scaling meaning that 1 p n q n 2 wave 1 6 2 p n q n 2 schro dinger 1 7 for scale invariant triples p q or p q the knapp example a solution to the respective equations which is highly concentrated along a light ray imposes the additional restrictions on the right in 1 4 1 5 for the schro dinger equation this simply means that 0 when strict inequality appears in 1 4 1 5 the estimate does not use the full rate of dispersion suggested by boundaryless problem m rn and hence such scale invariant triples are said to be subcritical when m rn it is well known that the full range of strichartz estimates are satisfied at least up to certain endpoint cases which we neglect here the imposition of the boundary conditions 1 3 affect the flow of energy com plicating the development of these estimates for boundary value problems consid erably as one must now account for the geometry of the boundary and the nature of the condition itself dirichlet or neumann in the present set of hypotheses that m is strictly concave and compact the full range of local estimates 1 4 for the wave equation are known when dirichlet conditions are imposed this is due to smith and sogge ss 95 when m is exterior to a strictly convex obstacle the same is true for the schro dinger equation 1 5 this is due to ivanovici iv 10 who also showed corresponding scale invariant estimates for the semiclassical equation with frequency localized data in these works the authors used the melrose taylor diffractive parametrix which is effective for homogeneous dirichlet conditions given further developments of zworski z on the other hand the author with smith and sogge proved a family of local scale invariant estimates for the wave and schro dinger equations bss 09 bss 12 operating under relaxed set of hypotheses on the geometry of the boundary and on the conditions themselves namely in the case of the wave equation the bound ary merely needs to be smooth and compact while for schro dinger equations m need only be a nontrapping exterior domain though scale invariant estimates of semiclassical type are proved in the process moreover both types of boundary conditions are allowed however the admissibility conditions on p q are restrictive in comparison to the estimates in free space as for wave equations it is assumed that 3 p n 1 q n 1 2 when n 4 and 1 p 1 q 1 2 when n 4 and for schro dinger equations admissibility is defined by replacing n 1 by n here these works were based on a parametrix construction due to smith and sogge ss 07 which gave similar estimates of square function type on arbitrary manifolds with boundary a common thread in the proof of schro dinger estimates referenced above is the use of a local smoothing bound of burq ge rard and tzvetkov bgt satisfied for solutions in nontrapping exterior domains 1 8 v l 2 t t h s 1 2 m f hs m c c m the interplay between these bounds and strichartz estimates is observed in works of journe soffer and sogge jss and staffilani and tataru st and the argu ments in the latter translate particularly well to boundary value problems the role of local smoothing bounds is to show that one can control the errors which estimates for the wave equation in strictly concave domains 3 arise by localizing the solution in the spatial variables reducing matters to proving estimates on solutions which are concentrated near a frequency scale and within a coordinate chart this allows one to employ a local parametrix construction within a chart without conflicting with the infinite propagation speed of solutions in par ticular after taking a littlewood paley decomposition of the solution and passing to weighted l 2 estimates matters are reduced to showing estimates for solutions to a semiclassical schro dinger equation over a unit time scale such as 1 1 1 9 dt 1 g v 0 v t spectrally localized to frequencies since solutions to this equation exhibit propagation speed which uniformly bounded in strichartz estimates can be treated by a local parametrix construction fur ther details on these localization arguments can be found in bss 12 2 bl 14 2 1 iv 10 3 and elsewhere in the case of the wave equation infinite speed of propagation is no longer an obstacle to local estimates the analogous program is thus to combine the classical local energy decay estimates in nontrapping exterior domains with local strichartz estimates near the boundary to yield strichartz es timates over global time scales this is due to smith and sogge ss 00 metcalfe me 04 and burq bu 03 in bl 14 the author furthered these ideas proving that whenever a refined family of estimates for the semiclassical schro dinger equation in strictly concave domains are satisfied scale invariant strichartz estimates follow as a result to state them given a small dyadic number 2 3 2 j 1 we define 1 10 s j t x 1 1 m d x m 2 j the refined local smoothing estimates thus assert that one obtains an additional gain of 2 j 4 in the usual local smoothing estimates by restricting the solution to such a small collar of the boundary the heuristic argument for such a bound is that a wave packet concentrated along a glancing ray should spend a time comparable to 2 j 2 within s j so that the square integral in time yields a gain of the square root of that amount theorem 1 1 suppose m is strictly concave and compact and that v is an ar bitrary solution to the semiclassical schro dinger equation 1 9 satisfying 1 3 with spectral localization taken with respect to the functional calculus of the respec tive dirichlet or neumann laplacian v t 2 g v t c c 2 2 1 if m is compact and v 0 l 2 m then the refined local smoothing estimates 1 11 2 j 4 v l 2 s j c v 0 l 2 m are satisfied for any 2 3 2 j 1 with c independent of j v 2 if 1 11 is satisfied with c uniform in j v then solutions to 1 9 with v 0 l 2 m satisfy the semiclassical strichartz estimate v lp 1 1 lq m c 1 p v 0 l 2 m provided 2 p n q n 2 consequently if m is the exterior of a connected strictly convex obstacle the scale invariant estimates for the classical equation in 1 5 hold for the same exponents if m is compact then 1 5 holds for the subcritical exponents but with a loss of 1 p derivatives that is h on the right hand side is replaced by h 1 p 4 m d blair whenm is a domain in rn exterior to a ball the bound 1 11 is due to ivanovici iv 07 when m is not assumed to have this structure these bounds are new and will be seen as a consequence of theorem 1 2 below in 4 1 as alluded to above 2 is the main theorem in bl 14 strictly speaking the estimates assumed there are for the classical schro dinger equation 1 2 and take the form 4 9 below but as noted in bl 14 2 2 the estimates for the semiclassical equation which follow are the crucial element in the proof the consequences for exterior problem follow from the aforementioned localization arguments and the consequences for compact manifolds follow from the methods for boundaryless manifolds developed by burq ge rard and tzvetkov bgt 2 in short the crucial idea in bl 14 is that the refined estimates 1 11 in some sense allow one to control the errors which arise through certain microlocalizations of the solution and therefore estimates can be obtained by the aforementioned wave packet parametrix in bss 12 a similar program was carried out for asymptotically flat schro dinger and wave equations by tataru tat 08 and metcalfe and tataru meta developing a family of refined local smoothing bounds for such equations then showing that these bounds can be using to estimate the error terms arising from a wave packet parametrix construction the purpose of the present work is twofold one is to prove 1 11 as a consequence of similar bounds for the wave equation thus verifying the crucial hypothesis in bl 14 the second is to prove theorems for the wave equation analogous to the second half of theorem 1 1 ones which will yield 1 4 for scale invariant triples which are subcritical with respect to the knapp example 2 p n 1 q n 1 2 the arguments apply equally well to the subcritical square function estimates which replace the strichartz norm by lq m l 2 t 1 1 and yield lq bounds on spectral clusters quasimodes determined by g for compact manifolds a significant degree of progress is therefore made in establishing the family of estimates surrounding the stein tomas restriction theorem to the setting of strictly concave boundaries when neumann conditions are imposed it is expected that the full range of these local estimates should hold for neumann conditions and that the restriction to subcritical triples is an artifact of the methods presented here our results also apply to dirichlet conditions but the full range of estimates are already known in this setting it is not known if the scale invariant strichartz and square function estimates can be obtained using the melrose taylor diffractive parametrix for homogeneous neumann conditions the main obstacle seems to be that the so called neu mann operator which amounts to the inverse of the dirichlet to neumann map is smoothing of order 2 3 instead of order 1 see the manuscript of melrose and taylor mt ch 8 an interesting feature of the present work is that the proof of the localized energy estimates under consideration rely on regularity estimates for boundary traces due to tataru tat 98 they not only show that the dirichlet traces associated to the neumann problem are smoother on the order of 5 6 instead of 2 3 but also show that by incorporating regularity away from the characteristic set in spaces of xs b type one can make up the full derivative we next state a useful bound which is intrinsic in that frequency localization can be characterized by the functional calculus first note that by the normal neighbor hood theorem the inward unit normal vector field n extends to a neighborhood of m such that n is tangent to any geodesic intersecting the boundary orthogonally estimates for the wave equation in strictly concave domains 5 we observe that when applying this vector field solutions exhibit an even stronger gain of 2 j 2 after restricting to the collar theorem 1 2 intrinsic localized energy estimates suppose m is strictly con cave and compact u t l 2 m for t 1 and that for some c c 2 2 u t 2 g u t then for some implicit constant independent of j we have that for any 2 j 2 3 1 1 12 2 j 4 u l 2 s j 2 j 4 t xu l 2 s j 2 j 2 nu l 2 s j u 0 l 2 m t xu 0 l 2 m d 2 t g u l 1 1 1 l 2 m where t xu denotes the intrinsically defined space time gradient tu gu as a consequence we will show space time bounds for the wave equation 1 1 of strichartz and square function type the latter estimates originate in mss which proved these estimates for boundaryless manifolds when m is compact square function estimates imply lq m bounds on spectral clusters or quasimodes deter mined by g more precisely the eigenvalues of the nonnegative operator g can be written as an increasing sequence 2 l l 1 with l 0 given 1 define as the operator which projects functions in l 2 m onto the subspace of eigenfunctions with the frequency of vibration satisfying l 1 functions in the range of thus form approximate eigenfunctions in that g 2 l 2 m l 2 m o theorem 1 3 intrinsic dispersive estimates suppose m is strictly concave and compact if u solves 1 1 then the strichartz estimates 1 4 are satisfied for any scale invariant subcritical triple p q so that 1 6 holds and 2 p n 1 q n 1 2 moreover for any 2 n 1 n 1 q we have the square function bounds 1 13 1 1 u t 2 dt 1 2 lq m f h m g h 1 m n 1 2 n q provided the right hand side is finite consequently for any 2 n 1 n 1 q 1 14 l 2 m lq m q n 1 2 n q the work of smith and sogge ss 07 establishes scale invariant squarefunction bounds for a smaller range of q but allows for both conditions 1 3 and only assumes that is c and compact that is no concavity assumption is used when dirichlet conditions are imposed and is strictly concave the estimates 1 13 1 14 are known up to the endpoint q 2 n 1 n 1 given results of grieser g and smith and sogge ss 94 the present results thus expand the range of known exponents in these estimates when neumann conditions are imposed it is now standard that 1 14 is a consequence of 1 13 for example one can apply the bound 1 13 to u t eit f and use duhamel s formula to estimate the source term given constructions of spectral clusters which behave like the spherical harmonics 1 14 is sharp for q in the given range 2 n 1 n 1 q also interpolation with trivial l 2 bounds yields estimates at the stein tomas endpoint l 2 m l 2 n 1 n 1 m n 1 2 n 1 for every 0 while this is not the sharp bound it is still significant from the standpoint of bochner riesz means indeed the method in so 02 shows that this 6 m d blair and 1 14 are enough to yield convergence of means of index n 1 2 1 q 1 2 when max q q 2 n 1 n 1 remark 1 4 in proving theorem 1 3 we will assume that 0 1 to see that this is sufficient for the square function estimates 1 13 note that if we can prove the theorem for q sufficiently close to 2 n 1 n 1 then we will have sufficiently close to n 1 2 n 1 1 2 1 n 1 interpolating with the sharp q bounds in ss 07 then yields the full range of estimates to see this for the strichartz estimates 1 4 note that the subcritical condition 2 p n 1 q n 1 2 implies that n 1 2 1 2 1 q when n 2 3 this quantity is strictly less than 1 so it suffices to establish estimates for 0 1 as the remaining family of estimates will follow by sobolev embedding when n 4 note that the sobolev regularity associated to the endpoint p q 2 2 n 1 n 3 is 1 2 1 n 1 0 1 therefore once subcritical estimates in a deleted neighborhood of this endpoint are established interpolation with the trivial p case yields the full family of subcritical estimates 1 1 estimates in coordinates theorem 1 3 states that the scale invariant sub critical strichartz bounds are satisfied in the time independent setting 1 1 1 4 our method for obtaining strichartz bounds and localized energy estimates applies to wave equations in time dependent settings as well but we will only state them in a non intrinsic coordinate dependent fashion suppose p is a strictly hyper bolic operator on rn 1 with principal symbol p x n i j 0 g ij x i j where g ij and its inverse determine quadratic forms of signature 1 n thus we are using x x 0 x 1 xn to denote coordinates in r n 1 and x 0 will play the role of the time variable suppose rn 1 is a smooth domain such that the boundary is time like with respect to gij we assume that the boundary is diffractive that is given any local defining function for we have h 2 p 0 we consider solutions to the wave equations satisfying the boundary conditions 1 3 but note that normal vector field n is defined with respect to the lorentzian metric gij near any point in there exists a coordinate system such that after multi plying by a p by a harmless smooth function the operator takes the form 1 15 pu d 2 xnu n 1 i j 0 dxi g ij x dxju lower order terms see ho 3 corollary c 5 3 tat 98 lemma 4 1 here xn is a defining function for the boundary that is is identified with xn 0 and is identified with xn 0 within the coordinate system we may assume that that g 00 x is uniformly bounded from below in the coordinate system so that the surfaces x 0 c are space like and that the quadratic form n 1 i j 0 g ij x i j has signature 1 n 1 moreover we assume that for some sufficiently small 1 16 gij diag 1 1 1 lip which can be arranged more generally by restricting to a sufficiently small cube and applying a linear transformation in x 0 xn 1 denoting r n 1 x xn 0 we may also suppose that every point in x x 2 rn 1 identifies with a point in with x max 0 i n xi theorem 1 5 time dependent strichartz estimates suppose u h 1 rn 1 and pu l 2 rn 1 are compactly supported in x 1 rn 1 within the coordinate estimates for the wave equation in strictly concave domains 7 system in the preceding discussion with u satisfying homogeneous dirichlet u xn 0 or neumann xnu xn 0 conditions then for any triple p q satisfying 1 p n q n 2 the subcritical condition 2 p n 1 q n 1 2 and 0 1 we have 1 17 u lp 1 1 x 0 w 1 q rn u h 1 rn 1 pu l 2 r n 1 here the sobolev space w s q rn with r n x 1 xn xn 0 and s 0 2 is defined by interpolating lq rn and w 2 q rn we take the latter to be the space of functions f with weak derivatives of up to order 2 in lq rn satisfying f xn 0 or xnf xn 0 the space h 1 rn 1 is defined to be the restrictions of h 1 rn 1 functions to rn 1 and the norm can be defined by taking a sum over the l 2 rn 1 norm of the function and its first order weak derivatives cf ho 3 corollary b 2 6 characterizing the strichartz estimates in this fashion allows us to avoid certain technicalities regarding the sobolev regularity of odd and even extensions of solutions we further note that the strichartz estimates in theorem 1 3 are a consequence of theorem 1 5 since bounds on an open set follow from results of kapitanski kap and mockenhaupt seeger and sogge mss it suffices to prove estimates for solutions supported in a sufficiently small set near the boundary we may thus take coordinates as above and assume u satisfies the hypotheses of theorem 1 5 by smoothly truncating the solution in time since g does not depend on t the coordinate transformation can be taken independent of x 0 t assuming that 0 1 the fact that u h 1 r n 1 pu l 2 r n 1 f h 1 m g l 2 m in this setting follows from energy estimates and that h 1 m h 1 m by elliptic regularity moreover elliptic regularity and the compact support of f g also means that w 2 q rn can be defined equivalently as the domain of i g in l q rn subject to the corresponding boundary condition consequently we have that u x 0 lq rn i g 1 2 u x 0 w 1 q rn and the bounds 1 4 follow from applying 1 17 to i g 1 2 u similar considerations hold in showing 1 13 here it also suffices to assume that u is compactly supported in x 1 within the same coordinate system and prove the following bound over what amounts to the vector valued space w 1 q rn l 2 1 1 x 0 1 18 r n 1 1 i g 1 2 u x 2 dx 0 q 2 dx 1 q u h 1 r n 1 pu l 2 r n 1 for the purpose of proving theorem 1 5 we may also assume that the coordi nate system has been extended to all of rn 1 so that g ij x diag 1 1 1 for x 3 this extension can of course be done in a fashion which respects 1 16 as consistent with the above we suppose that in spite of the extension the diffractive hypothesis holds for x 2 that is whenever 0 n 1 1 then n 1 i j 0 xng ij x i j is uniformly bounded from below by a positive constant we can now state our localized energy estimates in this coordinate system where the frequency localization occurs with respect to the fourier transform on rn 1 thus trading the compact support of u for rapidly decreasing tails in particular 8 m d blair the fourier transform in xn will be defined by taking an odd or even extension of the function in the case of dirichlet or neumann conditions respectively theorems 1 5 and 1 2 will follow as a consequence theorem 1 6 localized energy estimates in coordinates suppose 1 is sufficiently large and that u rn 1 c is such that the fourier transform is supported where n n and satisfies 1 19 u x n x 1 xn n u x 0 l 2 rn x 1 xn 3 2 assume further that u satisfies dirichlet or neumann conditions u xn 0 or xnu xn 0 then for j satisfying 1 2 j 2 3 we have the bound 1 20 2 j 4 du l 2 s j 2 j 2 dxnu l 2 s j du l 2 2 2 rn pu l 2 2 2 rn where d dx 0 dx 1 dxn is the full space time gradient in coordinates and s j x x 0 xn x 0 1 1 0 xn 2 j 1 2 organization of the paper we begin with proving the refined localized energy estimates in coordinates from theorem 1 6 in 2 which is actually the heart of the matter in 3 we prove theorems 1 5 and 1 3 working in analogy to bl 14 to obtain the subcritical strichartz and square function bounds as a consequence of 1 20 the final section is then dedicated to proving theorem 1 2 and seeing that the estimates in the first half of theorem 1 1 namely 1 11 follow as a corollary acknowledgement the author thanks hart smith for insightful discussions con cerning this work 2 localized energy estimates in this section we prove theorem 1 6 by a positive commutator argument in executing this approach we expect solutions microlocalized along a light ray to satisfy better estimates when the ray reflects nontangentially on the boundary as opposed to glancing at the same time an examination of the diffractive friedlan der model d 2 xn dx 1 dx 2 xnd 2 x 2 xn 0 shows that for solutions localized on the fourier side to 2 the uncertainty principle means that one cannot localize to scales finer than n 2 3 and xn 2 3 along the characteristic set however the composition of pseudodifferential operators which respect this localization will not exhibit gains in the symbolic calculus relative to higher order terms in the expansion given these observations a suitable candidate for the commutant will be one of the form q x xn dx dxn the composition of a differential operator in xn and a pseudodifferential operator acting in the tangential variables for each xn the xn dependent operator q will then have to distinguish between the glancing and non tangential behaviors this can be accomplished by conjugating p to a normal form which resembles the diffractive friedlander model at which point glancing behavior can then be determined by using the equation in particular if we were working with the friedlander model we use a defining function for the characteristic set of the xn dependent tangential operator dx 1 d 1 x 2 xn to determine the intersection of the characteristic sets of d 2 xn dx 1 dx 2 xnd 2 x 2 and d 2 xn this is inspired in part by the approach to boundary trace regularity in tat 98 estimates for the wave equation in strictly concave domains 9 2 1 reduction to a normal form here we treat as fixed and hence drop the subscript in the notation for u given that we use space time norms x 0 1 and x 0 2 on the left and right respectively we may replace u x by x 0 u x where is a bump function supported in 2 2 and identically one on 1 1 so that it now suffices to replace the x 0 intervals on the left and right in 1 20 by r we then microlocalize u further so that its space time fourier transform is localized near a cone 0 1 n 1 indeed outside this region elliptic regularity gains at least half a derivative over all of rn 1 see for example tay 91 theorem 2 2 b then u can further be decomposed as the sum of two functions localized to 0 1 n 1 and 0 1 n 1 respectively without loss of generality we may assume u is localized to the latter region it is convenient to change the notation in the argument which follows since the normal variable plays a special role we thus use s to refer to the normal variable formerly xn and to refer to its dual variable the variables x y rn will refer to the tangential variables with x x 1 xn so that the time coordinate formerly denoted by x 0 is now denoted xn using to denote variables dual to y x the principal symbol of the operator p may be written using the summation convention as 2 gij s y i j and the normal variable s is now written first hence up to lower order terms p d 2 s gij s y dyidyj note that in our new notation the fourier support of u is now concentrated where n 1 n 1 remark 2 1 before proceeding to the heart of the matter and conjugating our problem to a normal form we pause to comment on the regularity of the boundary tracer pu pu s 0 as it will be easier to show some estimates needed in lemma 2 4 at this stage write pu f 1 f 2 where f 1 n pu where n n ds is a fourier multiplier similar to the ones defined in below 3 but where we take the symbol to be identically one on a neighborhood of c and vanishing outside of 2 c for some sufficiently large constant c as mentioned in prior to theorem 1 6 the multiplier can be defined by taking a harmless even odd extension of pu to all of rn 1 and this is the one step on in the proof which uses the localization of u to equivalently n in the old notation we claim that the boundary traces fi s y s 0 satisfy s 0 r f 1 y 2 dy 1 2 1 2 f 1 l 2 rn 1 1 2 pu l 2 rn 1 2 1 f 2 h 1 2 s 0 f 2 h 1 rn 1 du l 2 rn 1 2 2 to see 2 1 recall the formula r f 1 f 1 d where is the dual to the normal variable we may restrict the domain of integration to so that cauchy schwarz and plancherel yield 2 1 as r f 1 2 d f 1 2 d d turning to 2 2 sobolev trace estimates mean that we only need to show the second inequality we regularize the coefficients of p to frequencies less than c for some sufficiently small c and denote p as the result of replacing the coefficients 10 m d blair of p by their smooth counterparts this yields f 2 1 n pu 1 n p p u as the fourier transform of p u is supported where 16 now let gij denote the regularization of gij which satisfies gij gij l 1 and dgij dg ij l 1 since derivatives falling on u yield a loss of 2 2 follows from gij gij dxidxjdu l 2 dg ij dgij dxidxju l 2 du l 2 as discussed above a key idea in the proof of theorem 1 6 is to apply a unitary fourier integral operator which takes p to a normal form resembling the diffractive friedlander model this is inspired by the strategy in tat 98 but in contrast to that work we take a fourier integral operator independent of s and ds which conjugates gij 0 y dxidxj to a normal form rather than taking a family of such operators which depend on s for the immediate discussion we denote a as the quadratic form in a y gij 0 y i j recall that the fourier support of u is supported in the conic region n 1 n 1 prescribing the data for the equation a b 0 suitably there exists a solution b y 0 which is homogeneous of degree one such that b y as in tat 98 lemma 4 2 we now set 1 ab 1 2 b which extends to a homogeneous canonical transformation y 7 x defined on the conic region n 1 n 1 by ho 3 theorem 21 1 9 using the summation convention in i j we have gij s y i j g ij 0 y i j s 1 0 sg ij st y i j dt 1 2 sr s x by the diffractive hypothesis r s s 21 0 r 2 nx defines an elliptic symbol satisfy ing for some c 0 0 2 3 r s x 22 r s x c 0 consequently there exists a unitary fourier integral operator t l 2 rnx l 2 rny such that conjugating p by this operator for each s yields the pseudodif ferential operator 2 4 d 2 s dx 1 dx 2 sr s x d where r is an elliptic operator with principal symbol r s s 01 0 r 2 nx strictly speaking we should add on an operator r 1 s x d to 2 4 such that for each s r 1 s op s 11 0 but the error here is harmless as it can be absorbed into pu recall that in the original coordinates u is supported in the region n 1 n 1 moreover regarding as a 2 a positive function of y we have 2 therefore there exists a smooth bump function such that 2 5 supp rn 1 2 rn and for each s 2 6 i d t 1 u s l 2 rn n n u s l 2 rn in the remainder of this section we may now replace u s by d t 1 u s as this t clearly preserves l 2 norms as noted above we may assume that p is exactly the pseudodifferential operator in 2 4 set j log 2 2 3 and define the following variations on the s j from above s j s x 2 j 1 s 2 j s j s x 0 s 2 j estimates for the wave equation in strictly concave domains 11 the former being defined for for 1 j j by geometric summation 1 20 is now a consequence of showing that for some implicit constant independent of k we have 2 k 2 dx 2 u 2 l 2 s k 2 k dsu 2 l 2 s k du 2 l 2 pu 2 l 2 and that the same holds over s j in either case we assume that the l 2 norms on the right are taken over rn 1 we now introduce the method of slowly varying sequences of tataru tat 08 4 it suffices to show that 2 7 j j 1 aj 23 s 1 4 dx 2 u 2 l 2 s j 2 3 s 1 2 dsu 2 l 2 s j du 2 l 2 pu 2 l 2 where aj j j 1 is defined by aj jk and the j j term in the sum is understood to involve the norm over l 2 s j let 0 be sufficiently small but fixed a positive sequence is said to be slowly varying if 2 8 log 2 j log 2 j 1 equivalently 2 j j 1 2 we claim that any sequence of the form aj jk above can be dominated by a slowly varying sequence satisfying j 1 indeed for 1 j j we may define j 2 j k 1 2 j k 2 j j which satisfies the desired requirements it now suffices to prove 2 7 with aj replaced by j the j will also satisfy j j 1 j 1 with implicit constant independent of k we now associate a smooth function s for s 0 to the sequence j with the properties s j for s 2 j 2 3 1 s 1 for s 0 23 k s 23 s k s moreover we may assume that 2 43 below is satisfied such a function can be constructed by beginning with a step function which satisfies the first two require ments then convolving with a bump function compactly supported in s 2 j near the discontinuity at s 2 j recalling that j j 1 j 1 we thus have that for any s 0 1 and any large constant c s 0 t c 2 3 t dt 1 this highlights the tradeoff in working with slowly varying sequences multiplying by t corrects the nonintegrability of t 7 1 t at the cost of obtaining an estimate j rather than p j for some p given that we may assume u s is localized in a cone cf 2 6 2 9 2 1 3 n and 2 the inequality 2 7 is now further reduced to 2 10 r n 1 s dx 2 u s x 2 c

commutator method we are now in a position to define the commutant which will yield the desired energy estimates after commuting with p in this subsection we assume that pseudodifferential operators are defined using the weyl quantization so that operators with real symbols are self adjoint which we use without further reference let c 1 and c 2 be large constants with c 1 c 2 and take to be the function 2 11 s c 2 s 0 t c 1 2 3 t dt recalling the definition of c 0 from 2 3 let be an increasing smooth cutoff on r supported in c 0 2 and identically one on c 0 4 also let c r be supported in 1 and identically one on 2 next let be a smooth cutoff to the region s 1 2 1 2 s 1 2 3 s 1 3 1 1 2 3 s one feature of is that for every s 2 23 it satisfies 1 2 r s x s 1 2 s equivalently 1 2 sr s x 1 2 sr s x where r 22 r is defined in 2 3 this shows that along the characteristic set of the operator in 2 4 truncates away from 2 0 on the scale of s amounting to the hyperbolic region when 0 s 2 2 3 we further let 2 12 q s x c 1 2 3 1 2 r s x s 1 2 where s 01 0 r 2 nx is the smooth cutoff defined in 2 5 given these defi nitions we let q s x q s x s let q be the operator acting on functions w s y on rn 1 defined by 2 13 qw s x 1 2 n ei x y q s x y 2 w s y dyd so that q acts as an s dependent pseudodifferential operator in the x variables also let q be the operator defined by the same integral but with q replaced by q so that q is the result of multiplying q by the function s we begin with a discussion of the regularity of the symbols here it is verified that s s 0 1 3 0 as each differentiation in 1 gains a power of 1 3 2 s 1 while each differentiation in the other directions results in a stronger gain of a power of 12 more generally we have that for k 1 ks r 2 nx are supported in s 2 3 and 1 12 k ks s 01 3 0 r 2 nx we next observe that for each s q s is a symbol in s 1 3 1 3 0 r 2 nx with respect to the tangential variables indeed rewriting q as q s x s 1 2 2 c 1 2 3 2 1 r 1 2 s 1 2 estimates for the wave equation in strictly concave domains 13 it can be seen that differentiating q in 1 gains a power of c 1 2 3 2 1 r 1 2 s 1 1 3 2 s 1 while in the other directions we have a stronger gain of 1 12 1 the symbols could be described more precisely using the weight vectors introduced by beals bea or the s m g classes of ho rmander ho 79 though this is not needed due to the frequency localization of the problem moreover the regularity of the symbol improves as s increases more generally it can be verified that for each s 2 14 k 1 s k 2 s q s s 1 3 k 1 k 2 1 1 3 0 r 2 nx with the same gains when differentiating in 1 and 2 n so that sq s and 2 sq s define symbols in s 11 3 0 and s 5 3 1 3 0 respectively however the regularity improves when multiplying by a power of s for example for each s 2 15 s 1 2 q s s 01 3 0 r 2 nx s sq s s 1 3 1 3 0 r 2 nx we consider a pseudodifferential operator of the form qds wu 1 2 qdsu 1 2 ds qu qdsu 1 2 dsq u where the superscript w in qds w is used to emphasize that we take the weyl quantization of q s x resulting in a differential operator in the s variable we also remark that dsq denotes the pseudodifferential operator with symbol dsq equivalently ds q and a similar convention will be taken below e g the operator 2 sq in 2 23 below is the pseudodifferential operator with symbol 2 sq the positive commutator strategy is thus to prove suitable upper and lower bounds on 2 16 re i p qds w u u where denotes the standard inner product on l 2 rn 1 remark 2 2 the choice of symbol q determined by 2 12 can be motivated by considering the diffractive friedlander model the differential operator with symbol p 2 1 2 s 22 though the discussion here will restrict attention to the first term in the integrand on the left in 2 10 if one takes the ansatz that the commutant should take the form q s 1 2 which would be suitable for this model then formally the principal symbol on the of the commutator in 2 16 is hp q s 2 2 sq s 2 2 q s 2 2 2 1 2 s sq s q s where the second identity follows by using that 2 1 2 s 2 2 along the characteris tic set here we factor out 22 as it yields the derivativedx 2 which will fall on u the method of integrating factors gives that the solution to 2 1 2 s sq q f s 1 2 when 1 2 s 0 is 2 17 q s 1 2 1 2 1 2 s 1 2 s 0 1 2 t 1 2 f t 1 2 dt 14 m d blair up to terms independent of s recalling 2 10 we want to choose f such that f s c 1 2 3 s 1 2 taking equality here satisfies this objective but the approach taken so far only works away from the zero set of 1 1 2 s or equivalently 0 selecting f s 1 2 1 2 s 1 2 s c 1 2 3 s means that the integral in 2 17 is independent of 1 2 and is effective provided 1 2 s c 1 2 3 s at the same time since 1 2 s 1 2 2 along the characteristic set we should have suitable upper bounds on the commutator since this formally means qds dx 2 at the other extreme when 1 2 s is small in that 1 2 s 2 c 1 2 3 s taking q s c 1 2 3 s 1 2 independent of 1 2 with as in 2 11 it can be verified that hp q s c 1 2 3 s 1 2 the choice of q determined by 2 12 is thus the result smoothly transitioning between these two extremes by employing the cutoff while respecting the uncertainty principle below it will be seen that introducing the into the symbol presents acceptable error 2 2 1 upper bounds on the commutator we first prove upper bounds on 2 16 which does not use the structure of the commutator but instead we integrate by parts to dominate the expression by du 2 l 2 pu 2 l 2 begin by noting the following integration by parts formulae with s 0 f dx denoting the integral of the function x 7 f s x s 0 over rn dsv w v dsw i s 0 vw dx qds wv w v qds ww i s 0 vqw dx v qds ww i s 0 qvw dx d 2 sv w v d 2 sw s 0 svw dx s 0 v sw dx thus since p d 2 s is an operator acting in the tangential variables we use the boundary condition as appropriate to obtain p qds wu u qds wu pu s 0 s qds wuudx s 0 qds wu sudx qds wpu u pu qds wu i s 0 puqudx combining the two thus yields 2 18 i p qds w u u 2 im pu qds wu i s 0 qds wu sudx i s 0 s qds wuudx s 0 puqudx to control the boundary integrals we need the following theorem of d tataru theorem 2 3 tat 98 suppose u h 1 rn 1 and pu l 2 rn 1 1 suppose u satisfies dirichlet conditions then the normal derivative satisfies 2 19 su l 2 s 0 u h 1 pu l 2 estimates for the wave equation in strictly concave domains 15 2 suppose u satisfies neumann conditions then 2 20 u h 5 6 s 0 dt 5 6 u l 2 s 0 u h 1 pu l 2 where dt denotes the tangential sobolev weight fourier multiplier with symbol 1 2 12 moreover let b denote the pseudodifferential operator with symbol b 56 1 3 2 1 1 4 and consider the h 1 5 6 spaces defined in tat 98 p 195 stating that u s 0 h 1 56 if and only if bu l 2 then see p 203 of that same work 2 21 bu l 2 s 0 u h 1 5 6 s 0 u h 1 pu l 2 for 2 21 we recall that the unitary transformation t defined in 2 1 agrees with the one in tat 98 when s 0 we now use these results to obtain estimates on the boundary integrals needed in our argument lemma 2 4 there exists a uniform constant c such that 2 22 re s 0 i qds wu su c du 2 l 2 pu 2 l 2 moreoever the boundary traces of u and its derivatives satisfy the following bounds s 0 u 2 sq u du 2 l 2 pu 2 l 2 2 23 s 0 puqu du 2 l 2 pu 2 l 2 2 24 s 0 i s qds wuu du 2 l 2 pu 2 l 2 2 25 proof we first observe that 2 22 is only nontrivial if dirichlet conditions are imposed in this case since q 0 s 1 3 1 3 0 is nonnegative the sharp g arding inequality see e g tay 91 proposition 0 7 b shows that re s 0 i qds wu su re s 0 q su su su 2 l 2 s 0 the estimate 2 22 now follows from 2 19 the remaining bounds are only nontrivial if neumann conditions are imposed so this will be assumed for the remainder of the proof the inequality 2 23 is a consequence of 2 20 and the fact that 2 sq 0 s 5 3 1 3 0 r 2 nx s 0 u 2 squ dt 5 6 2 sq u l 2 s 0 dt 5 6 u l 2 s 0 u 2 h 5 6 s 0 turning to 2 24 we recall the decomposition pu f 1 f 2 and bounds 2 1 and 2 2 from remark 2 1 both of these bounds are preserved by the action of the unitary operator defined in 2 1 the frequency localization again gives that 1 2 q s 0 op s 5 61 3 0 so that by cauchy schwarz and 2 20 we have s 0 f 1 qu pu l 2 rn 1 u h 56 s 0 du 2 l 2 pu 2 l 2 16 m d blair to handle f 2 we use 2 2 and that dt 1 2 q s 0 op s 5 6 1 3 0 s 0 f 2 qu du l 2 rn 1 u h 56 s 0 du 2 l 2 pu 2 l 2 we finally turn to the bound in 2 25 observe that 2 26 i s qds wu 1 2 s q su 1 2 2 s qu q 2 su 3 2 sq su 1 2 2 sq u given the boundary condition and 2 23 we only need to treat the first term here which by the equation p s 0 d 2 s dx 1 dx 2 reduces to estimating s 0 q dx 1 dx 2 u u s 0 qpuu and the second term is handled using 2 24 the principal symbol of qdx 1 dx 2 at s 0 is c 2 2 3 1 1 3 1 2 r 0 x 1 2 1 2 we now use the operator defined in 2 21 observing that the principal symbol of the triple composition b 1 qdx 1 dx 2 b 1 is 53 1 3 2 1 1 2 2 3 1 1 3 1 2 r 0 x 1 2 1 2 s 01 3 0 r 2 nx consequently s 0 q dx 1 dx 2 u u s 0 b 1 qdx 1 dx 2 b 1 bu bu bu 2 l 2 s 0 which by 2 21 concludes the proof of 2 25 recalling that sq s s 11 3 0 r 2 nx and the definition of q following 2 13 we have that 2 27 qds wu l 2 rn 1 q dsu l 2 rn 1 du l 2 rn 1 consequently given the boundary trace estimates we now have that 2 18 yields 2 28 re i p qds w u u q dsu l 2 pu l 2 du 2 l 2 pu 2 l 2 with all l 2 norms on the right taken over rn 1 the first term on the right here will be treated in 2 38 below 2 2 2 lower bounds on the commutator we now view i p qds w as a positive operator and compute the left hand side of 2 28 in a manner which reflects this first compute i sr dx 1 dx 2 qds w u q s 1 2 sq sr dx 1 dx 2 u qr u sq sr u q dx 1 dx 2 sr su 1 2 sq dx 1 dx 2 sr u estimates for the wave equation in strictly concave domains 17 next we compute d 2 s qds w u 1 2 d 2 s qdsu d 3 s qu qd 3 su ds qd 2 su 1 2 d 3 s q u d 2 s q dsu ds q d 2 su 2 dsq d 2 su 2 d 2 sq dsu 1 2 d 3 sq u where the last equality is a consequence of expanding each commutator in the second line and collecting like terms using that q is the product of s and the operator q the last row here can be rewritten as 2 ds s q d 2 su 2 s dsq d 2 su 2 d 2 sq dsu 1 2 d 3 sq u for the second term here we replace d 2 su dx 1 dx 2 sr u pu using the equation for the first term here we split its contribution in half making the same replacement for half the terms but not the other the result is i d 2 s qds w u u s q d 2 su u s q 2 s sq dx 1 dx 2 sr u u 2 2 sq su u 1 2 3 sq u u s q 2 s sq pu u however we note that re 2 sq su u 2 sq su u s 2 squ u s 0 u 2 squdx 3 sq u u s 0 u 2 squdx which eliminates the 2 sq su term at the cost of adding a boundary term moreover after an integration by parts which generates trivial boundary terms we obtain s q d 2 su u s q dsu dsu s q s sq su u and the real part of the second term on the right hand can be reduced to a sum of terms of the form k 1 s k 2 s q u u k 1 k 2 3 the same argument used to eliminate re 2 sq su u in summary using harmless coefficients c 2 k 1 k 2 c 3 k 1 k 2 we may write 2 16 as 2 29 re s q dsu dsu 4 i 1 re eiu u k 1 k 2 2 c 2 k 1 k 2 re s 0 k 1 0 k 2 s q uu where 2 30 e 1 u s q 2 s sq dx 1 dx 2 sr u qr u 2 31 e 2 u k 1 k 2 3 c 3 k 1 k 2 k 1 s k 2 s q u 18 m d blair 2 32 e 3 u sq sr u 1 2 sq dx 1 dx 2 sr u 2 sq pu 2 33 e 4 u q dx 1 dx 2 sr su the key lower bound on 2 16 follows from lemma 2 5 given e 1 e 2 as defined in 2 30 2 31 we have that 2 34 s 0 s c 1 2 3 s 1 2 dx 2 u s x 2 dsdx re e 1 u u re e 2 u u du 2 l 2 before proving the lemma we discuss how it concludes the proof of 2 10 we first claim that 2 35 k 1 k 2 2 s 0 k 1 0 k 2 s q uu e 3 u u du 2 l 2 pu 2 l 2 the boundary trace is estimated using 2 23 since sq s 11 3 0 we have sq pu u pu sq u pu l 2 du l 2 which bounds the last term in 2 32 next we observe that the symbolic calculus and 2 14 2 15 means that the remaining operators in e 3 are in op s 2 1 3 0 which handles these terms by frequency localization in particular the symbol of sq dx 1 dx 2 does not involve any derivatives of the form 1 sq we next turn to the term e 4 u u claiming that 2 36 e 4 u u q su l 2 du l 2 du 2 l 2 but this follows from the symbolic calculus which allows us to write e 4 q dx 1 dx 2 sr b 1 q b 2 for some b 1 b 2 op s 11 3 0 for each s with symbol bounds uniform in s now define a s x q s x 1 2 s 1 6 1 3 0 r 2 nx and let a be the operator defined by the fourier integral in 2 13 thus for each s q a 2 op s 01 3 0 and since functions of s commute with a we now have the following lower bound on the first term in 2 34 2 37 s 0 s c 1 2 3 s adsuadsudsdx re s q dsu dsu du 2 l 2 we now recall the arguments at the end of 2 1 given the observations there the lemma 2 37 and the upper bounds above we have the following estimate for any 0 which we will see is an acceptable deviation from the one in 2 10 max 1 j j 2 j adsu 2 l 2 s j max 1 j j 2 j 2 dx 2 u 2 l 2 s j du 2 l 2 pu 2 l 2 q dsu l 2 du l 2 pu l 2 q dsu 2 l 2 1 1 du 2 l 2 pu 2 l 2 taking 0 sufficiently small it suffices to show that 2 38 q dsu 2 l 2 max 1 j j 2 j adsu 2 l 2 s j du 2 l 2 estimates for the wave equation in strictly concave domains 19 however since q a 2 op s 0 1 3 0 for each s it suffices to show that 2 39 a 2 dsu 2 l 2 s j 2 j 2 adsu 2 l 2 s j as geometric summation can then be used to handle the sum over all 1 j j on the left recalling that when j j we change s j to s j but this follows from the fact that for each s 2 3 s 1 4 a s s 01 3 0 r 2 nx in summary we obtain the following estimate which is stronger than 2 10 max 1 j j 2 j 4 du l 2 s j max 1 j j 2 j 2 adsu l 2 s j du l 2 pu l 2 indeed for each s 1 a s x s 01 3 0 r 2 nx so by the symbolic calculus the second term on the left here dominates the second term on the left in 1 20 up to acceptable error dsu l 2 sj adsu l 2 s j du l 2 proof of lemma 2 5 begin by observing that up to acceptable errors in s 2 1 3 0 r 2 nx the symbol of e 1 can be computed as 2 40 s 22 1 2 sr s x c 1 2 3 1 2 r 1 s 1 2 c 1 2 3 s s 22 c 1 2 3 r 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 sr r 1 s c 1 2 3 1 2 r 1 s 3 2 strictly speaking we should include a term of the form 1 2 1 2 sr sr 1 in the brackets and should also account for derivatives of but these terms can be neglected as their contribution is in s 2 1 3 0 for every s our first task is now to check that 2 40 is bounded below by 2 41 22 s c 1 2 3 s 1 2 for some sufficiently small constant 0 later on we will see that 2 40 also dominates the contribution of re e 2 u u we first treat the term involving s observing that s 1 2 1 s 2 1 2 s 1 2 3 s 2 3 2 3 s 1 2 s 1 13 1 the contribution of the first term to the brackets in 2 40 here is nonnegative since is increasing and 1 1 2 sr 0 on the support of that term the second is only nonzero when 1 23 s 2 13 1 0 and 1 12 s 1 0 that is 1 1 3 and 1 c 0 2 2 s 1 3 since 1 2 1 2 sr 43 for such s 1 2 the contribution of this term in 2 40 can be dominated by the term c 1 2 3 r by taking c 1 sufficiently large 20 m d blair in the region 0 the remaining portion of the second term in 2 40 is nonnegative by choosing c 1 large and the first is bounded below by s 22 1 2 sr s x 1 2 c 1 2 3 s s 22 c 1 2 3 s 1 2 we are left to consider the case when 0 in this case we need to see that s 1 2 s s c 1 2 3 1 2 when s 23 this is clear in the region 1 c 1100 1 3 as s 1 here in all other cases 1 2 c 0 2 s and the right hand side dominates the left hand side by taking c 2 sufficiently large in the definition of say c 2 100 we now turn to the contribution of e 2 and we claim that the absolute value of this is majorized by the expression in 2 40 a tedious computation reveals that when 3 k 1 ks is supported where s 2 3 and that ks s k moreover it can be seen that for these k 1 2 ks s 1 k hence another computation reveals that 2 42 k 1 s k 2 s q c 2 c 1 2 3 s 3 2 2 3 s 2 indeed the worst possible contribution comes from the case where k 2 3 and the term which involves 3 s otherwise one has larger powers of c 1 2 3 s 1 first consider the more difficult 0 region here we need to see that we may dominate the right hand side of 2 42 by the first term in 2 40 c 2 c 1 2 3 s 3 2 2 3 s 2 s 1 2 s 1 2 2 c 1 2 3 s or equivalently after cancelation and multiplying both sides by 5 3 c 2 c 1 2 3 s 1 2 1 2 3 s 2 s 2 3 1 2 2 3 s 1 2 since we may assume that s 1 for s 23 this inequality is clear for such s by taking c 2 c 1 since 2 3 1 2 1 in this case otherwise we need to exploit some facts about our function s given our definition of slowly varying 2 8 we may assume that for s 0 2 43 2 3 2 s s 23 and for k 1 2 3 k 2 ks s 23 k the latter being a consequence of the former and induction since s 1 we can take dyadic numbers k 1 k 2 such that 2 k 1 23 and 2 k 2 s to see that s 23 s 3 2 6 for s 23 it now suffices to show that c 2 c 1 2 3 s 1 2 2 3 s 2 23 s 12 3 but this again is clear by taking c 1 c 42 and 3 12 estimates for the wave equation in strictly concave domains 21 the 0 case is easier as here it is sufficient to see that the right hand side of 2 42 is dominated by the second term in 2 40 leading us to bound c 1 2 3 s 3 2 2 3 s 2 c 1 2 3 s 3 2 2 c 1 2 3 after canceling but this is equivalent to 2 3 s 2 c 1 4 3 which can be arranged by taking c 1 large we now define a new symbol b s x by 22 b s x 2 40 k 1 k 2 3 c 3 k 1 k 2 k 1 s k 2 s q s x 2 41 for some 0 sufficiently small in 2 41 defining the operator b as in 2 13 we are reduced to seeing that there exists c sufficiently large such that for any s 2 44 0 re bdx 2 u s x dx 2 u s x dx c dx 2 u s 2 l 2 rn indeed the symbolic calculus shows that the difference between the left hand side of 2 34 and the first term here is dominated by the acceptable error 2 u 2 l 2 du 2 l 2 to see 2 44 we make a comparatively crude argument which uses a variant of the fefferman phong inequality see tay 91 theorem 0 7 c stating that the inequality 2 44 holds provided b s s 2 uniformly and with first observe that 2 45 b s x s 1 2 sr s x 1 2 c 1 2 3 s 1 0 c 1 2 3 1 2 c 1 2 3 s 3 2 0 as above the derivatives of b in 1 are the most poorly behaved gaining pow ers of c 1 2 3 2 1 r 1 2 s 1 while derivatives in the remaining directions 2 n gain powers of 1 1 hence naively one has b s s 11 3 0 and the fefferman phong inequality does not apply however when 1 2 s is bounded below by a small number the derivatives in 1 gain powers of 1 2 and the symbol is in s 11 2 0 correcting this matter otherwise when s 1 2 we use smooth bump functions to write b b 1 b 2 where supp b 1 1 1 2 and supp b 2 1 2 1 2 in this case we have that supp b 1 supp so over supp b 1 the derivatives of b in 1 gain full powers of 1 1 1 so we may select the bump function so that b 1 s 11 2 0 on the other hand using 2 45 we have b 2 2 3 so b 2 s 2 31 3 0 thus applying the fefferman phong inequality separately to the operators defined by b 1 and b 2 yields the desired bound 3 strichartz and square function estimates 3 1 preliminary reductions in this section we prove theorems 1 3 and 1 5 we revert back to the notation in 1 1 letting x 0 denote the time coordinate and xn a defining function for the boundary recall that given the discussion following theorem 1 5 it suffices to prove 1 17 1 18 for u compactly supported in x 0 we extend u to all of rn 1 by reflecting the solution and the initial data the in boundary xn 0 in an even or odd fashion corresponding to neumann or dirichlet conditions thus preserving the boundary condition u xn 0 or xnu 0 22 m d blair extending the metric coefficients in an even fashion gij x xn pu will then have the same parity as u over all of rn 1 the extended coefficients are thus lipschitz and satisfy 1 16 in this section the preliminary reductions are common to both strichartz and square functions estimates to enable us to treat them simultaneously we let x denote the function space corresponding to either strichartz or square function bounds u x u x qdx p q dx 0 1 p or u x u x 2 dx 0 q 2 dx 1 q where x denotes x 1 xn and the domain of integration in this variable is over all of rn since we assume that u is compactly supported in x 0 we may take the domain of integration in this variable to be next we observe that it suffices to show that the extended solution u satisfies 3 1 d 1 u x u h 1 rn 1 pu l 2 rn 1 in other words it suffices to assume that the sobolev spaces respectively vec tor valued sobolev spaces in 1 18 can be replaced by the usual sobolev spaces over rn defined with respect to the fourier multiplier 1 2 1 2 but this follows from interpolation since f w 2 q rn f w 2 q rn whenever f is an odd respectively even extension of a function satisfying f xn 0 0 respectively xn f xn 0 0 and similarly for the vector valued counterpart we now note that it suffices to assume that the support of the space time fourier transform supp u is supported away from the origin this follows from sobolev embedding and the fact that the commutator of p with a smooth cutoff to 0 1 1 will map l 2 h 1 next let be a fourier multiplier defined by a homogeneous function of degree zero such that supp 0 1 n so that supp 1 is disjoint from the characteristic set of p this can be arranged by taking sufficiently small in 1 16 sobolev embedding and elliptic regularity see for example tay 91 theorem 2 2 b then give d 1 1 u x 1 u h 3 2 u h 1 rn 1 pu l 2 rn 1 here we have implicitly used that p h 1 l 2 which follows since the coifman meyer commutator theorem guarantees gij l 2 h 1 note that supp splits into two disjoint regions corresponding to 0 0 taking a finer partition of unity we may further restrict the support of assuming that it is supported where 0 0 and where 1 2 n as a rotation of coordinates treats the other cases we take a careful littlewood paley decomposition let l l 0 be a sequence of smooth functions l 0 0 1 such that 3 2 l 0 l 1 for 0 l 1 2 l 1 for l 1 with supp 0 0 2 and supp 1 2 1 2 2 3 2 now let tk be the fourier multiplier with symbol k the t here signifying tangential estimates for the wave equation in strictly concave domains 23 next let nl denote the fourier multiplier with symbol l n for l k we then let n k denote the multiplier with symbol 1 k l l n so that the mul tiplier truncates to frequencies 2 k and 3 3 d 1 u k 1 n k t k d 1 u k 1 l k 1 nl t k d 1 u applying the littlewood paley square function estimate first in l then in k yields k 1 l k 1 nl t k d 1 u 2 x k 1 l k 1 2 l 1 nl tk u 2 x it is clear that this can be done for strichartz estimates and in the case of square function estimates we use that d 1 localizes to 0 1 to apply the littlewood paley estimate in the x 0 variable similarly we have k 1 n k t k d 1 u 2 x k 1 2 k 1 n k tk u 2 x we now show that we may bound the second sum in 3 3 let pl denote the differential operator obtained by truncating the metric coefficients in the frequency variable to frequencies 0 1 n 2 l note that if gijl denotes the regular ization of gij then gijl gij l 2 l the angle one parametrices from ss 07 and bss 09 which amounts to the 1 case in 3 15 below show that 3 4 2 l 1 nl tk u x 2 l nl tk u l 2 pl nl tk u l 2 we have that l k 2 l nl tk u l 2 p pl nl tk u l 2 nl tk p u l 2 is bounded by the right hand side of 3 1 which uses the consequence of the coifman meyer commutator bound p l 2 h 1 cf the ensuing argument it thus suffices to see that k 1 l k p nl tk u 2 l 2 is bounded by the right hand side of 3 1 khinchin s inequality reduces this to showing that for an arbitrary sequence l k 1 3 5 gij k 1 l k l k n l t k v l 2 v h 1 but this a consequence of bootstrapping the coifman meyer commutator theorem a similar line of reasoning can be applied to the first sum in 3 3 hence it suffices to show that n k t k u satisfies the following estimates akin to 3 4 2 k 1 n k tk u x 2 k n k tk u l 2 pl n k tk u l 2 note that without loss of generality we may assume that is independent of n near n 0 so that n k can be written as n k n 0 n 1 since n k n is even n k t k u satisfies the same homogeneous boundary conditions as u relabeling this function as u 2 k the desired estimates now result from 24 m d blair theorem 3 1 suppose in the coordinate system chosen above the fourier support of u is localized to a conic region 1 2 n and also a region where 0 1 assume further that p is the operator formed by truncating the coefficients of the operator in 1 15 to frequencies less than if u satisifies boundary conditions u xn 0 0 or xnu xn 0 then 3 6 u x u l 2 1 p u l 2 3 2 the nontangential tangential decomposition here we introduce the de composition used in bl 14 which allows us to use the localized energy estimates to bound the error terms in a wave packet parametrix for p thus yielding theorem 3 1 begin by defining as a function of q p by 3 7 n 1 1 2 1 q 2 p x lplq n 1 1 2 1 q 2 q x lql 2 the motivation for this choice is that it characterizes the gain j in the x estimates for solutions which are localized to a cone n j established in ss 07 bss 09 note that the subcritical hypotheses on the exponents definingx ensure that 0 we next choose 2 3 such that 1 3 1 2 in this section we let j be the largest integer such that 2 j for 1 j j let j xn 2 jxn where supp 2 2 and supp 1 r 1 1 then let j j j 1 so that supp j 2 j xn 21 j now take a sequence of smooth cutoffs to be applied in the n variable such that supp j n 2 j 2 supp j n 2 j 2 1 and j n l n l 1 l j l n 1 j n 1 j j j n for n in the projection of the support of u now define wj j dxn ju 1 j j vj j dxn ju j dxn j 1 l j l dxn ju 1 j j vj j dxn j u it is not hard to verify cf bl 14 p 792 3 that u vj j 1 j 1 vj wj 2 the main idea in showing theorem 3 1 is that the results in ss 07 bss 09 imply that when 1 j j wj x 2 j 2 2 j 4 wj l 2 12 j 4 p wj l 2 3 8 vj x 2 j 2 2 j 4 vj l 2 1 2 2 j 8 12 2 j 4 xn mvj l 2 12 j 4 p vj l 2 3 9 1 since the j in the subscript here denotes that the support lies in n 2 j 2 this is a slight deviation in the notational convention above 2 the purpose of the decomposition is so that jsupp wj captures the nontangential reflections of u in the boundary in the process jsupp vj contains bicharacteristic rays which are distant from the boundary making tangential a slight misnomer estimates for the wave equation in strictly concave domains 25 and that 3 10 vj x 2 j 2 1 6 vj l 2 7 6 p vj l 2 postponing the proof of these estimates we show that they yield theorem 3 1 the argument is essentially the same as the one in bl 14 2 3 but we review it here for the sake of completeness we will take m sufficiently large based on in the middle term on the right in 3 9 its presence will be motivated later on for now we note that since j dxn is rapid decaying outside of 2 j 2 neighborhood of 2 j xn 2 j 1 and 2 3 j 2 1 3 2 1 we have 12 2 j 4 xn mvj l 2 2 3 j 2 m 2 u l 2 1 3 2 m 2 u l 2 so that the factor on the right can be made smaller than 1 2 by choosing m large next we will show that for all choices of j including j j 3 11 2 j 4 vj l 2 12 j 4 p vj l 2 u l 2 p u l 2 and that the same holds when vj is replaced by a wj therefore we may use the geometric gains of 2 j 2 in 3 9 3 8 to see that j 1 j 1 vj x wj x is dominated by the right hand side of 3 6 the term vj is then estimated by using that the gain here combined with the gain of 2 j 2 in 3 10 counterbalances the loss of 1 6 indeed our choice of ensures that 1 6 2 j 2 j 4 16 4 2 1 too see 3 11 when 1 j j first observe that given the frequency local ization 1 p p u l 2 u l 2 since the coefficient smoothing yields a gain of 1 thus the localized energy estimates in theorem 1 6 and frequency localization give 3 12 2 j 4 vj l 2 u l 2 1 p u l 2 we are left to bound p vj p j ju j p j u j j p u it is straightforward to bound the contribution the last term so we will show that 3 13 12 j 4 p vj j j p u l 2 2 j 4 j 1 u l 2 which in turn is bounded using the same argument as in 3 12 the commutator p j can be written as a sum of j g lm dxldxm and j dxlg lm dxm where l m 6 n and glm denote the coefficients of p observe that glm j l 2 l 2 12 j 2 uniformly in j this can be verified by examining its schwartz kernel since glm c 1 and we may assume symbol bounds of the form k j 12 j 2 k cf bl 14 2 30 frequency localization thus bounds the contribution of this commutator as for the second commutator term 3 14 j p j u 2 j xn xn j u j 2 xn j u since kxn j 2 jk and 12 j 2 j xn l 2 l 2 uniformly we see that the contribution of this term is bounded above by the right hand side of 3 13 the proof of 3 11 when j j or when vj is replaced by wj is similar 26 m d blair 3 3 square function bounds we now use results in ss 07 and later bss 09 to prove 3 8 3 9 3 10 for now we assume x lql 2 and discuss the case of strichartz bounds in the next section in this case it is convenient to use the microlocalization of u to treat p as an operator hyperbolic in x 1 taking the factorization g 11 x 1 q x 1 q x 0 2 n x x 0 x 2 xn for some functions q which are positive on the support of wj vj the notation x thus plays a slightly different role here than previously we then let q x denote the symbol obtained by truncating q to x frequencies and use q to denote the corresponding operator 3 moreover since 1 q x 0 on the support of wj vj we have by elliptic regularity cf ss 07 p 115 dx 1 q x dx vj l 2 1 p vj l 2 vj l 2 dx 1 q x dx wj l 2 1 p wj l 2 wj l 2 let j 2 j 2 13 1 and suppose j is a microlocal cutoff to frequencies n 2 j 2 j for some sufficiently small 0 we also define slabs sj k k j k 1 j x 1 rnx s 1 1 x 1 rnx with sj k s given the results in ss 07 we have the following estimate on arbitrary functions u such that u is supported in 0 2 n that is to say any such function not just the one which birthed vj and wj 3 15 ju lql 2 sj k j u l l 2 s dx 1 q x dx u l 1 l 2 s where we take the norms on the left and right to mean lql 2 sj k l q k j k 1 j x 1 rn 1 x 2 xn l 2 rx 0 lpl 2 s lp 1 1 x 1 l 2 rnx p 1 indeed this is a consequence of theorem 3 1 when n 2 and the discussion preceding theorem 7 2 when n 3 in ss 07 along with the flux estimates in 6 there 4 we stress that this result holds for any 2 j 2 13 1 not just ones which satisfy j j as above moreover as indicated there the same result holds if the microlocal cutoff j truncates to n 2 3 instead this is equivalent to saying that n when 1 3 so we refer to this as the 1 3 case below we will provide a brief sketch of 3 15 below for the convenience of the reader and to show the flexibility of the argument however we stress that what will appear is merely a summary and the estimate is due to smith and sogge for now we observe that it yields the bounds 3 8 to this end note that if j k x 1 is a bump function supported in k 1 j k 2 j which is identically one for 3 the work ss 07 uses the notation p to denote this first order operator 4 note that the notation varies slightly in this work as we are taking a base 2 decomposition in n instead of the usual dyadic decomposition in particular ss 07 denotes 2 j also strictly speaking in ss 07 l 1 l 2 s is replaced by l 2 s but given duhamel s principle the former is acceptable estimates for the wave equation in strictly concave domains 27 x 1 k j k 1 j then the duhamel formula allows us to see that 3 16 j kwj l l 2 s dx 1 q x dx j kwj l 1 l 2 s 2 j 4 wj l 2 s j k 2 j 4 dx 1 q x dx wj l 2 s j k where s j k k 1 j k 2 j rnx 5 thus 3 15 implies that wj lql 2 sj k is dominated by this quantity since s j k s j k 6 implies that k k 1 we obtain 3 8 by taking a sum in k proof sketch of 3 15 let qj be the operator obtained by replacing q by the operator obtained by truncating the symbol q to frequencies less than 1 2 1 2 j 1 22 j 4 suppose dx 1 qj x dx u fj gj when j 1 3 we claim that 3 17 ju lql 2 sj k j ju l l 2 sj k 1 4 1 4 j 1 2 1 2 j xn 1 ju l 2 sj k fj l 1 l 2 sj k 1 4 1 4 j 1 2 1 2 j xn 2 gj l 2 sj k and when j 1 3 recall that this is the case of a cutoff to n 2 3 we claim that 3 18 ju lql 2 sj k j ju l l 2 sj k fj gj l 1 l 2 sj k the aforementioned flux estimates in ss 07 6 show that the right hand side here is in turn uniformly bounded by the right hand side of 3 15 cf ss 07 3 1 in particular we have for 1 which is ss 07 6 31 scaled back using x 7 1 j x 3 19 qj x q x n 1 2 1 2 j 1 2 1 2 j xn n and hence the error induced by replacing q by qj can be absorbed into gj the key idea is that the singular contribution of 2 xn g lm x xn is 2 xnglm x 0 xn hence regularizing the symbol in this manner results in such tails to see 3 17 we may translate to k 0 and dilate by a factor of j thus considering with a slight abuse of notation u x ju jx which is now localized at a frequency scale j with n j when j 1 3 or n 1 2 when j 1 3 note that the slab sj 0 dilates to a unit slab s 0 rn in the new coordinates we write dx 1 q x dx u f g where the symbol of q is q x jqj jx 1 j when j 1 2 equivalently j 1 3 in the old coordinates the bound 3 17 rescales to u lql 2 s j u l l 2 s 1 4 1 2 j 1 2 xn 1 u l 2 s f l 1 l 2 s 1 4 1 2 j 1 2 xn 2 g l 2 s and when j 1 2 equivalently j 1 3 the bound 3 18 rescales to u lql 2 s j u l l 2 s f g l 1 l 2 s 5 the cutoffs j are denoted as j in ss 07 given the bound 3 14 it is convenient to include the multiplier j in the driving force instead of estimating its contribution as in 6 4 of that work 28 m d blair we now suppress the dependence of on j for the remainder of the argument consider the wave packet transform of a function f y y rn t f x n 4 e i y x g 1 2 y x f y dy where g is smooth radial and compactly supported in a small ball about the origin with g l 2 rn 2 n 2 the transformation satisfies t t i and hence t l 2 rny l 2 r 2 nx is an isometry let hq dx q d d q dx denote the hamiltonian vector field of q when 1 2 1 x 2 q x 1 2 1 2 max 0 1 2 for 1 that is q behaves as a c 2 symbol truncated to frequencies less than 1 2 this is the threshold by which it can be seen that t q ihq t l 2 rny l 2 r 2 nx is uniformly bounded hence u x t u x 1 x solves a transport equa tion in x 1 x with bounded driving force when 1 2 q instead satisfies bounds 1 x 2 q x 1 2 n 1 1 2 1 1 12 xn n for 1 cf ss 07 6 32 therefore by ss 07 lemma 4 4 u instead solves the transport equation x 1 hq u x f x g x where over s 0 r 2 nx 3 20 f l 1 l 2 s 1 4 1 2 12 xn 2 g l 2 s u l l 2 1 4 1 2 12 xn 1 u l 2 s f l 1 l 2 s 1 4 1 2 12 xn 2 g l 2 s the main idea is that since packets are spatially concentrated within a distance 1 2 the conjugation error t q ihqt can be bounded by employing the weighted l 2 estimates in particular the proof uses that if supp f n 3 21 t q ihqt f l 2 r 2 n x n f l 2 1 2 12 xn nf l 2 and hence the exact powers of 12 xn in 3 20 are not crucial by the same idea we have that 12 xn nt u l 2 s 1 2 xn nu l 2 s cf ss 07 4 3 let 0 r x denote the integral curve of hq satisfying 0 r x r 0 x it is shown that by employing duhamel s principle and the v 2 q spaces of koch and tataru the desired lql 2 bounds on u follow from the following estimate on functions f x l 2 r 2 n such that supp f n 3 22 wf lql 2 s f l 2 r 2 n x w f x t f 0 x 1 x indeed the compact support of g in the definition of t means that supp u n the kernel k x y of ww can be written cf ss 07 p 131 n 2 ei x z i y 1 x 1 y zy 1 x 1 g 1 2 x z g 12 y zy 1 x 1 dzd estimates for the wave equation in strictly concave domains 29 where is supported in n consequently the bound on w follows from showing that the kernel k x y satisfies cf ss 07 p 150 3 23 k x y dx 0 k x y dy 0 n 1 1 x 1 y 1 n 2 2 1 2 x 1 y 1 1 2 indeed this yields an l 1 x 2 xnl 2 x 0 l x 2 xnl 2 x 0 bound which can be interpolated with trivial l 2 bounds to obtain the following for fixed x 1 y 1 k x y f y dy lql 2 rn x 2 2 x 1 y 1 2 q f y 1 lq l 2 rn x this is because we may assume that q is sufficiently close to but strictly greater than 2 n 1 n 1 we may sacrifice as much of 1 2 x 1 y 1 1 2 as is needed to obtain the decay in x 1 y 1 the rest contributes to a gain in at this point the hardy littlewood sobolev inequality shows that ww f lql 2 s 2 2 f lq l 2 s the main idea behind 3 23 is that k is concentrated in a 1 neighborhood of the light cone so integration in y 0 always yields a gain on that scale the gains in can be motivated by considering the three cases x 1 y 1 1 1 x 1 y 1 1 2 and 1 2 x 1 y 1 in the first case the separation of x 1 y 1 generates negligible oscillations so one simply picks up the volume of the support ofk in the last case the separation in x 1 y 1 generates the usual decay in x 1 y 1 the second case is thus intermediate to these two extremes one obtains the best estimate by exploiting oscillations in all variables except for n thus obtaining adjusted decay in x 1 y 1 while gaining which is the volume of the n projection of supp we now turn to the proof of 3 9 given 3 19 we may write fj dx 1 qj x d vj so that it suffices to show the following analogue of 3 17 vj lql 2 sj k 2 j 2 vj l l 2 sj k 1 4 2 j 4 12 2 j 4 xn mvj l 2 sj k fj l 1 l 2 sj k as the error q qj vj can be absorbed by the middle term in 3 9 also commuting the equation with a cutoff j k as before the l pl 2 sj k spaces can be replaced with weighted l 2 s j k spaces next we rescale the problem by 2 j 2 setting 2 j 2 and v x vj 2 j 2 x f x 2 j 2 fj 2 j 2 x we then use the wave packet transform as before setting v t v x 1 hq v f using 3 21 with 2 j 2 we have that f l 1 l 2 s n u l l 2 s 1 4 2 j 4 12 xn mv l 2 s f l 1 l 2 s we are thus reduced to showing 3 22 with 2 j 2 and supp f contained in a set of the form n while in previous works 3 22 is shown under the assumption that the support of f is instead of the form n tracing through the steps of the proof verifies that the larger support presents no additional complication alternatively one can simply use a smooth partition of unity j n log 2 2 3 n j l log 2 2 3 j n partitioning supp f into cones of smaller angles so that 3 22 applies to each term 30 m d blair the bound 3 10 follows by similar considerations but this time we trun cate q to frequencies less than 2 3 and take the dilation x 7 1 3 x so that 2 3 and that in the new coordinates 1 x 2 q x max 0 1 2 for 1 therefore as observed above conjugating q by the wave packet trans form introduces bounded error duhamel s principle means that we are reduced to showing that with w defined as before wf lql 2 s 2 j 2 f l 2 when supp f n 2 j 2 the bound thus follows by the same considerations as in the vj case 3 4 strichartz estimates when x lplq we instead factorize the principal symbol of p as a quadratic in 0 instead of 1 g 00 x 0 q x 0 q x 1 2 n x x 1 x 2 xn again with q 0 on the support of u working with the half wave operator dx 0 q x the proofs of 3 9 3 10 3 8 all follow by the same procedure as before indeed this is the key observation in bss 09 the only crucial difference is that the integration in 3 23 is not needed one simply observes that 3 24 k x y n 1 x 0 y 0 n 2 2 1 2 x 0 y 0 1 2 so that for n 1 2 n 1 q 2 p sufficiently small interpolation gives k x 0 y 0 y f y 0 y dy lq rn x 2 2 x 0 y 0 2 p f y 0 lq rn x with x x 1 xn again by sacrificing only as much of the last factor on the right in 3 24 as needed to obtain the x 0 y 0 2 p decay 4 intrinsic localized energy estimates here we prove theorem 1 2 then later verify the first part of theorem 1 1 since the estimates here are for time independent metrics we use both t and x 0 to denote the time coordinate by duhamel s formula it suffices to assume that d 2 t g u 0 by taking a finite partition of unity it suffices to prove estimates on u where is a smooth bump function supported in a suitable coordinate system specifically we use the coordinate system outlined in 1 1 recalling that this can achieved by a transformation which is independent of t we assume that in these coordinates is supported in t x 2 identically one on t x 1 and that is independent of xn near xn 0 we may also suppose that the metric is extended to be flat for x 3 recall that with x det glm x we have that in our coordinate system gf 1 x n i j 1 dxi gij x x dxj f gin x in as in 1 1 we take an odd or even extension of u across xn 0 for dirichlet or neumann conditions respectively and a corresponding odd or even extension of d 2 t g u across xn 0 therefore in what follows g denotes the differential operator obtained by extending the coefficients of g evenly across xn 0 we also abbreviate p d 2 t g the desired estimates will follow from a further frequency decomposition determined by the fourier transform in the coordinate system since this requires us to examine frequency scales with respect to the fourier transform estimates for the wave equation in strictly concave domains 31 which are less than we introduce u 2 g 1 u which by the functional calculus satisfies u t l 2 m u t l 2 m let j be a smooth bump function identically one on xn 2 j and supported in xn 2 j 1 now define the seminorm u ej 2 j 4 n 1 i 0 jdxiu l 2 rn 1 2 j 2 jdxnu l 2 rn 1 so that it is sufficient to show that for an implicit constant independent of j 4 1 2 j 4 2 j u 2 l 2 rn 1 u 2 ej u 2 l 2 rn 1 d u 2 l 2 rn 1 p u 2 l 2 rn 1 u 2 l 2 rn 1 d u 2 l 2 rn 1 p u 2 l 2 rn 1 1 n i 1 dxi tu 2 l 2 rn 1 where denotes a vector of bump functions with support contained in supp and d dx 0 dx 1 dxn indeed if such estimates are valid then energy estimates show that the right hand side is bounded by the right hand side of 1 12 we use the decomposition 3 3 from above with respect to the fourier trans form in our coordinates but replacing u by u we first note that the family j nl tk u l k is almost orthogonal in frequency as j rapidly decreasing out side of n 2 j 2 3 consequently we have the following bound on the terms where the normal frequencies dominate both and the tangential frequencies 2 j 4 2 j k 1 l max k log 2 nl t k u 2 l 2 k 1 l max k log 2 nl t k u 2 ej k 1 l max k log 2 2 j 4 2 nl tk u 2 l 2 nl tk u 2 ej next we have that 4 2 2 j 4 2 j nl tk u 2 l 2 nl tk u 2 ej 2 nl tk u 2 l 2 rn 1 d n l t k u 2 l 2 rn 1 p n l t k u 2 l 2 rn 1 in fact a stronger estimate holds as the gain 2 j 4 can be replaced by 2 j 2 in all cases this can be seen either by using the angle one parametrix in ss 07 surveyed in 3 3 or by using that the solution can be represented as a sum of fourier integral operators of the proper order indeed the fourier localization to a cone n means that the solution is concentrated along rays which reflect in the boundary at an angle uniformly bounded from below and hence the gain in regularity is determined by the fact that packets will escape the region xn 2 j in a time scale comparable to 2 j we now sum over the terms on the right hand side of 4 2 over l k the terms not involving p present no problem as the sum over these terms are bounded by the first term in 4 1 we next observe that for an arbitrary sequence l taking on 32 m d blair values 1 and any lipschitz function a the coifman meyer commutator theorem shows that a l l n l maps l 2 h 1 hence as in 3 5 we have k 1 l k 1 p nl tk u 2 l 2 k 1 tk u 2 h 1 rn 1 k 1 p tk u 2 l 2 an easier commutator argument then shows that the sum on the right is bounded by the right hand side of 4 2 theorem 1 6 and a similar commutator argument shows that 2 j 4 2 j k log 2 n k t k u 2 l 2 k log 2 n k t k u 2 ej is also bounded by the right hand side of 4 1 we are now left to handle the cases where the frequency scale given by coor dinates are less than which requires us to consider u as defined above which satsifies u 2 gu first observe that for 1 4 3 log 2 k 1 log 2 l k jd nl t k u 2 l 2 log 2 k 1 log 2 l k jd nl tk u l 2 2 since we can use almost orthogonality in k but not in l we will make a slight abuse of notation here and below treating the l k term in the second sum as the result of replacing nl by n k next observe that 4 4 2 j 4 j nl tk u l 2 2 j 4 k j nl tk dt u l 2 where in slight contrast to 2 2 we abbreviate dt dx 1 dxn 1 without the time derivative this allows us to lump the mass terms in our estimates in with the derivatives over i 1 n 1 we have that for i 0 n 4 5 dxi n l t k u 2 g dxi n l t k u 2 dxi n l t k g u 2 dxi n l t k g u the two terms on the right are of lower order in that we have the following bound which does not use any restiction to s j 4 6 4 5 l 2 rn 1 2 ci k l n m 1 dxmu l 2 rn 1 2 dt tu l 2 rn 1 where ci k l 2 k when i 0 n 1 and ci k l 2 l when i n note that when i 1 n 1 the loss of only 2 k counterbalances the smaller gain presented by 4 4 the very last term involving dt tu only comes into play when i 0 proving such estimates on the first term in 4 5 is thus straightforward to see how to bound the second term in 4 5 note that the highest order contribution of dxi n l t k g u can be estimated by writing nl g ij tk dxidxj u n l t k g ij dxidxj u where nl is either of the form n l or 2 ldxn n l and t k is either of the form tk or 2 kdxi t k i 1 n 1 since we only need to consider tangential derivatives dxidxj i j 1 n 1 in this expression the first term yields a net estimates for the wave equation in strictly concave domains 33 gain of 2 k l and the second can be bounded using that the smoothness of gij in x 1 xn 1 means t k g ij dxi is bounded on l 2 the lower order contributions of dxi n l t k g u can be handled just by using that the commutator of n l t k with an l function is merely bounded on l 2 given 4 6 the l 2 rn 1 norm of 4 5 exhibits an overall gain of 1 which is stronger than the gains of 2 j 2 even after logarithmic losses from summation in k l note that the same principle works when the nl is replaced by a n k now observe that 12 j 4 k n 1 i 0 j g dxi n l t k u l 2 22 j 2 j g dxn n l t k u l 2 12 j 4 l n 1 i 0 jdxi nl tk u l 2 22 j 2 2 l jdxn nl tk u l 2 where nl t k denote vectors of fourier multipliers with symbols supported in supp nl supp t k respectively we now claim that this in turn is bounded by 2 l max 0 j 4 l 6 22 l max 0 j 2 l 3 2 nl tk u h 1 p nl t k u l 2 but this is a consequence of either using the parametrix as in 4 2 or applying theorem 1 6 as before in the cases l k and l k respectively indeed when 2 j 2 2 l 3 the width of the collar is large enough relative to the frequency scale so that we obtain the usual gain otherwise if 2 j 2 2 l 3 we obtain estimates by restricting to a larger collar of width 2 l consequently we may split the right hand side of 4 3 into cases 3 j 2 l and 3 j 2 l to see that up to terms exhibiting a stronger gain it is bounded by log 2 k 1 tk u 2 h 1 p tk u 2 l 2 after exploiting gains in p nk as above exploiting commutators as before this in turn is bounded by the right hand side of 4 1 4 1 refined local smoothing for the schro dinger equation here we prove the first half of theorem 1 1 that is we verify the estimate 1 11 suppose fk is spectrally localized to frequencies g 2 2 and that k 2 2 we observe the following bound for such functions which follows from the bound on the first term in the main estimate from theorem 1 2 4 7 max 1 2 j 2 3 2 j 4 fk l 2 s j fk l 2 m k 1 k 2 g fk l 2 m indeed this follows by simply applying 1 12 to u t x e itkfk x and using that gfk l 2 m k fk l 2 m it is interesting to note that this shows that if fk is an l 2 normalized quasimodes spectral clusters satisfying fk 1 and k 1 k 2 g fk l 2 m 1 then fk l 2 s j is o 2 j 4 for any 1 j 2 3 to prove 1 11 it suffices to prove it for solutions to the homogeneous equation dt 1 g v 0 moreover it suffices to assume that for some orthogonal 34 m d blair collection of eigenfunctions g l 2 l l v t x 2 l 2 e it 2 l l x with v 0 2 l 2 m 2 l 2 l 2 l 2 m let be a smooth bump function such that t 1 for t 1 1 and t 0 for t 2 by plancherel s identity we have v 2 l 2 t s j s j k l k k 1 1 2 l l x 2 d dx next we observe that since is rapidly decreasing we may restrict the domain of integration of the inner integral on the right to 4 4 indeed if is outside this interval then 1 2 l and hence the contribution of 4 4 to this integral is o n v 0 2 l 2 m for any n we now use that k k 2 1 for any to get that 4 8 s j 4 4 k l k k 1 1 2 l l x 2 d dx k 4 4 s j l k k 1 k 1 2 l l x 2 dx d when l k k 1 4 4 we have that 1 2 l 1 1 k 2 1 k 1 and hence the rapid decay of implies that max 1 k 1 k 2 2 l k 1 2 l 1 1 2 l 2 thus 4 7 applied to fk l k k 1 k 1 2 l l and orthogonality thus show that the right hand side of 4 8 is bounded by l 2 l 2 m concluding the proof of 1 11 remark 4 1 let m rn be a c domain exterior to a compact connected strictly convex obstacle we remark that the bound 1 11 for solutions to the semiclassical equation can be combined with 1 8 to give estimates on solutions to the classical schro dinger equation dt v 0 which are frequency localized in that v t 2 v t for some c c 1 2 2 using the functional calculus of the dirichlet or neumann laplacian specifically we claim that the following refinements of the local smoothing bounds hold 4 9 2 j 4 1 2 v l 2 r s j m v 0 l 2 m where this time s j m x m d x m 2 j and the implicit constant is independent of and 1 j 2 3 log 2 this extends the results of ivanovici iv 07 for the exterior to a ball in rn to this more general setting and reflects that for the classical schro dinger equation propagation speed is proportional to frequency to see this let c c m be identically one on a neighborhood m as a consequence of 1 8 we have if f dt g v then 1 2 v l 2 r m 1 2 f l 2 r m v 0 l 2 m estimates for the wave equation in strictly concave domains 35 note that since v is spectrally localized to frequencies near 1 this bound is valid for both boundary conditions in 1 3 for k z let ik k k 1 and i k k 1 k 2 if we can show that 2 j 4 1 2 v l 2 1 2 ik s j m 1 2 v l 2 1 2 i k m 1 2 f l 2 1 2 i k m over the dilated intervals 1 2 ik 1 2 k 1 2 k 1 then the prior estimate and summation in k will yield 4 9 setting v t x v 1 t x f t x dt 1 v t x 1 f 1 t x means that we are reduced to showing that 2 j 4 v l 2 ik s j m v l 2 i k m f l 2 i k m but this can be seen as a consequence of 1 11 above indeed by taking r large so that supp r r n and by identifying sides of the cube here we may isometrically embed supp into a compact manifold with boundary we may now adapt
