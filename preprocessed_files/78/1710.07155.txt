warwick coventry cv 4 7 al united kingdom 2 electrical electronic and power engineering school of engineering and applied science aston university aston triangle birmingham b 4 7 et united kingdom a savojardo warwick ac uk abstract we propose an experimental setup to study collision induced soliton amplification in an optical fibre with anomalous dispersion 2 0 we replace a small region of the fibre with a normal dispersion fibre 2 0 we show that solitons colliding in this region are able to exchange energy depending on the relative phase of the soliton pair we find that the energy transfer can lead to an energy gain in excess of 20 for each collision a sequence of such events can be used to enhance the energy gain even further allowing the possibility of considerable soliton amplification this energy transfer does not require a third order dispersion or raman term 2021 optical society of america ocis codes 190 0190 nonlinear optics 190 5530 pulse propagation and temporal

solitons are spatially localized solutions that exist in many nonlinear wave equations 1 their collisions are fully elastic with all properties of both solitons conserved in particular their individual energies in optical fibres soliton propagation is usually described using the non linear schr dinger equation nlse 1 2 the stability of the soliton solutions is the result of a perfect balance of dispersion and non linearity 3 however if this perfect balance is disturbed more ar x iv 1 71 0 07 15 5 v 1 ph ys ic s op ti cs 1 9 o ct 2 01 7 fig 1 schematic representation of the optical fiber used for the thought experiment the horizontal fiber is indicated in blue the light blue region corresponds to the anomalous dispersion fiber 2 0 while the normal dispersion fiber 2 0 of length is indicated in dark blue the light propagation direction is indicated by a thin horizontal line including the point of collision z 0 general collision scenarios become possible indeed energy transfer in pairwise soliton collisions has been observed experimentally 5 9 and discussed theoretically 4 10 this scenario usually requires the additional presence of third order dispersion 4 11 12 raman scattering 6 8 13 and shock terms 6 8 13 14 in the nlse in this paper we describe a dispersion map that leads to inelastic soliton collisions without any such additions consider a fibre with standard anomalous dispersion in which two solitons with different group velocities propagate as stable pulses and eventually collide the trick is now to replace the section of the fibre where the soliton collision takes place with a section of normal dispersion fibre cf fig 1 in the normal dispersion regime the solitons are unstable hence able to exchange energy under collision keeping this normal dispersion section short avoids excessive pulse width broadening which would otherwise destroy the solitons we optimize the dispersion map to maximize energy transfer between the solitons while keeping the disturbance of the soliton shape as small as possible hence two stable solitons emerge into the anomalous dispersion regime and continue to propagate 2 the model to model the situation proposed above we use the nlse 2 with a dispersion map 2 z zu i 2 z 2 2 t u i u 2 u 0 1 here u z t is the pulse envelope z is the distance of propagation t is the time in the frame moving with the average group velocity of the carrier wave and the non linear coefficient the dispersion 2 z is equal to a constant 2 0 in the region z 0 2 z 0 2 and equal to 2 elsewhere denotes the length of the normal 2 0 fibre symmetrically around the point of collision z 0 we start with an initial condition consisting of two solitons at z z 0 such that we can write initially u z t p 1 sech t t 1 t 1 e i 1

can calculate their inverse velocity v 1 i 2 i period ti 2 pi and energy ei 2 piti a b fig 2 two soliton collision for the experimental setup described in fig 1 the intensity u 2 is plotted as function of time t and distance z the phase difference corresponds to a the maximum and b minimum energy transfer e 1 e 2 plotted in fig 3 a the horizontal blue line indicates the point of collision z 0 in the normal dispersion fiber 3 numerical results fig 2 a and 2 b show representative results for the collision of two solitons for the experimental setup described in fig 1 the intensity u 2 is plotted as function of time t and distance z the initial conditions in both collisions are identical apart from the relative phase between the two solitons in a 0 13 and in b 1 87 the initial power and frequency are p 1 100 w 1 10 thz p 2 70 w and 2 6 thz the length of the optical fiber with normal dispersion is 0 6 m the optical fiber specifications are 2 0 01 ps 2 m 1 and 0 003 w 1 m 1 in fig 2 a first soliton 100 w collides with a second soliton 70 w after the collision both solitons emerge with peak power different from the initial one in fig 2 a energy is transfered from the second to the first soliton the emerging pulses have peak power of 138 w and 24 w respectively the first soliton has gained 38 w in amplitude in fig 2 b we observe the opposite behavior the emerging pulses have peak power of 50 w and 73 w respectively although in this case the second soliton gains just 3 w and half of the power of the first soliton is radiated in fig 3 b we show the maximum peak power of fig 2 a in order to highlight details of the process the initial peak value is 100 w then after the collision it oscillates and slowly dampens to the value 138 w when away from the collision region this peak power mostly corresponds to the value of the first soliton the numerical experiment confirms our hypothesis instability leads to soliton energy exchange surprisingly energy transfer occurs without third order dispersion and raman term 11 13 the artificial instability due to the change of sign in the second order dispersion term is sufficient to mimic the effect of higher order terms for the two soliton collision to determine the influence of the phase difference and the length on the energy transfer we studied collisions varying these two parameters for each value of and we calculate the percentage of energy transfer e 1 e 2 from soliton 2 to soliton 1 fig 3 a shows the result of these calculations the energy transfer changes with it can be positive or negative meaning that energy can go from the second soliton to first one and vice versa the local maximum and minimum are at 0 13 and 1 87 respectively the maximum value of e 1 e 2 corresponding to the collision in fig 2 a is 22 the minimum corresponding to the collision in fig 2 b is 35 this asymmetry towards the minimum is an indication of energy loss and can be understood as energy that is radiate during the scattering process the energy transfer increases with and it is null when is zero confirming that the unstable region is fundamental for the process to occur a b fig 3 a energy transfer e 1 e 2 as function of the phase difference for various lengths of the normal dispersion fiber b maximum peak power continuous blue line as function of the distance z calculated for the intensities in fig 2 a the dotted red line indicates the average power of 138 w after the collision fig 4 experimental setup for two consecutive amplifications one normal dispersion segment is placed at every point of collision the colors are chosen as in fig 1 4 optical amplification the above results show that the system in fig 1 is an amplification device particularly assembling many of such devices in series a soliton can be amplified several times for example with three initial solitons and two devices in series like in fig 4 we get the amplification shown in fig 5 a in this case a first soliton 100 w collides with a second 70 w and then a third soliton 70 w absorbing energy at every collision the first soliton emerges with an amplitude of 138 w from the first collision and an amplitude of 178 w from the second collision as shown in fig 5 b the initial phase differences are chosen so that the energy transfer is maximized at every scattering in principle there is no limit to the number of amplification devices that can be assembled and the early soliton can be amplified at every collision as long as it has a certain phase difference with the other colliding pulses 5 conclusions our numerical experiment indicates the energy transfer between two unstable bright solitons in the normal dispersion regions of a fiber we find that the width of the normal dispersion region is crucial for the process to occur as well as the phase difference between the two solitons the device in fig 1 can be built in a real world laboratory and our predictions for the energy transfer fig 3 a can be verified experimentally not only do our findings have fundamental implications in the field of soliton interaction and rogue waves generation 11 15 but the device in fig 1 can be exploited for soliton
