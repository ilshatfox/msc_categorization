with collisionless plasma is carried out formulas for calculation electric current in collisionless plasma with arbitrary degree of degeneration of electronic gas are deduced it has appeared that the nonlinearity account leads to occurrence of the longitudinal electric current directed along a wave vector this second current is orthogonal to the known transversal current received at the classical linear analysis key words collisionless plasmas vlasov equation dirac fermi plasma with arbitrary degree of degeneration of electronic gas electrical current pacs numbers 52 25 dg plasma kinetic

plasma has been deduced then the same formula has been deduced and in work 2 in the present work formulas for calculation electric current into collisionless plasma at any temperature at any degrees of degeneration of the electronic gas are deduced it has appeared that electric current expression consists of two sum mands the first summand linear on vector potential is known classical expression of electric current this electric current is directed along vector potential of electromagnetic field the second summand represents itself electric current which is proportional to the square vector potential of electromagnetic field the second current is perpendicular to the first and it is directed along the wave vector occurrence of the second current comes to light the spent account nonlinear character interactions of electromagnetic field with plasma let us underline that the nonlinear phenomena in plasma are studied more half century see for example 20 22 however the electric current directed along a wave vector was not is revealed earlier 1 vlasov kinetic equation and its solution let us consider vlasov equation describing behaviour of collisionless plasmas f t v f r e e 1 c v h

used for collisionless plasmas for the solution it is used the method of consecutive approximations as small parametre the quantity of the vector potential of electromagnetic field or to it proportional quantity of intensity of electric field is considered at use of approximation of the second order it appears that the electromagnetic field generates an electric current directed along the wave vector and proportional to the size square of electric field thus an electric current directed along electric field the same as in the linear analysis 11 references 1 klimontovich y and silin
