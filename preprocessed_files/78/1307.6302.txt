dubna russia 141980 abstract we consider acceleration of 6 ions by the field of a traveling wave in a helical waveguide the frequency of the accelerating rf field f 0 100 mhz generator power p 0 2 mw the initial energy of ions ein 50 kev nucleon final energy efin 5 mev nucleon accelerator length lacc 10 m a spiral with the initial and final radii of winding r 0 in 2 0 cm and r 0 fin 1 cm is placed in a screen of diameter 2 r 100 mm ion focusing is provided by a solenoidal magnetic field with the intensity b 0 3 5 tesla with increasing the accelerator length up to l 15 m the final energy of the ions can be increased up to a value of efin 7 mev nucleon introduction for the treatment of cancer by hadrons therapy it is required to use c 6 ions accelerated up to the energy 400 mev nucleon these ions can be obtained from an isochronous or ion cyclotron in the latter case one requires an injector or linear accelerator of c 6 ions z a with an energy approximately equal to einj 5 mev nucleon inj 0 1 where v c is the speed expressed in terms of light speed in vacuum 1 selection of basic parameters we assume the synchrotron perimeter p 30 m then for the one turn injection the injected beam pulse duration 1 s now we assume that for treatment of one patient it is necessary to use a beam with intensity roughly equal to nc 6 3 10 9 particles s let the synchrotron cycle at the frequency f 1 hz the initial energy of the accelerated ions can be of the order ein 50 kev nucleon in 0 01 while no major problems occur with the high voltage power supply u e s 100 kv and drift tube 2 ion source carbon ions and protons can be produced in required quantities and with the desired beam intensity by means of an ecr ion source however such a source is a complex and expensive device that poorly interfaces with the most suited for 2 application in oncology synchrotrons operating in pulsed mode a more appropriate source is the electron beam ion source ebis 3 linear accelerator accelerators with an azimuthally symmetric wave have been traditionally used for ion acceleration as is known 1 in this case one cannot provide both the radial and phase stability simultaneously because radial focusing under the conditions for auto phasing radial focusing requires presence of external field in standing wave accelerators quadruple focusing lenses were placed inside the drift tubes in the cavities ion focusing by external longitudinal field being not in use at all then since the technology to provide constant high intensity solenoid fields had not been yet developed in 1956 vladimirskiy 2 proposed to introduce an azimuthally asymmetric component into the resonator gaps and implement focusing at the expense of the geometry of the accelerating field subsequently the proposal was transformed into crystals with fingers and rfq structure such structures require high precision manufacturing and setting tolerances through the development of technologies of superconducting solenoids it may become easier and cheaper to accelerate ions by an azimuthally symmetrical wave and perform their focusing by a longitudinal magnetic field in standing wave resonators the drift tubes useless in terms of acceleration occupy of the length of the accelerator the entire field strength at the same time being concentrated in the gaps of the resonators operating in the prebreakdown regime this makes no problem in a traveling wave accelerator the high frequency pulse duration at acceleration by traveling wave can be short because there is no need in this case to excite the cavity 4 accelerating structure based on a helical waveguide an accelerator injector can be constructed on the basis of a spiral waveguide operating at the frequency f 0 100 mhz 0 3 m in which changes are made not only to the pitch but also to the radius of the frame onto which the spiral is wound to provide synchronism between particles and waves 3 4 the frame is to have a conical shape with the initial radius of the spiral winding r 0 in 2 cm and final radius r 0 fin 1 cm which can significantly increase the uniformity of the field along the helical waveguide 3 when the power of the high frequency generator p 0 2 mw and selected synchronous phase sin s 60 0 the accelerator length turns short approximately equal to lacc 10 meters due to the acceleration in the traveling wave the intensity of the wave field e 10 kv cm the spiral waveguide does not impose strict requirements for precision manufacturing and assembly structures this is explained by the fact that a large number of turns of the spiral are involved in the formation of the wave field slow 0 3 30 cm h 0 1 0 6 cm where is the particle velocity 0 is the wavelength in the free space h is the step of the spiral winding and therefore the allowance for the step of the spiral winding is not rigid radial stability must be ensured by the external magnetic field b 0 3 5 6 t created by a superconducting solenoid located on the outside of the spiral waveguide the inner hole of the solenoid di must be greater than the diameter of the outer conductor of the spiral waveguide 2 r di 2 r while the inner diameter of the solenoid must be of the order of di 10 15 cm the screen located at a distance from the spiral and representing an outer conductor has virtually no effect on the electromagnetic properties of the spiral and does not cause any difficulties when manufacturing the superconducting solenoid the initial velocity of the particles of the carbon ion beam t 0 obtained from an ebis source lies in the range t 0 r 0 2 0 2 1 2 3 10 4 evaluation of the phase space ellipse of the beam rb t z yields the value 2 3 10 4 0 02 30 mm mrad which can be achieved in the ion sources without any particular problems in this case the greater is the magnetic field of the b 0 coil which focuses the ions in a linear accelerator the greater may be the initial radius of the particle beam 5 the structure of the field in a spiral waveguide placed in a screen expressions for the fields in a spiral placed in an outer metallic cylinder screen can be written as 5 where index 1 refers to the

between the screen and spiral pass into expressions for the fields in a spiral in free space 5 expression 5 transforms into the corresponding formula 5 linking the power flow to the field strength on the axis for a spiral without a screen the effect of the screen consists in the reduction of the intensity of the external electric field on the helix axis a corresponding reduction in the final energy of the particles phase velocity of the wave for a given length of the accelerator and a slight increase in the pitch 5 6 linear accelerator the longitudinal motion of ions a linear accelerator is to accelerate ions up to the speed fin lin 0 1 in this respect it is to start after pre acceleration by the potential difference u 100 kv with the speed in lin 0 01 the initial energy being 50 kev

to the frame profile onto which the spiral is wound 8 damping of waves in a spiral waveguide as a result of power damping in a spiral waveguide the synchronous phase calculated for the case without damping will deviate from the synchronous phase obtained for acceleration of particles with account of attenuation 8 attenuation of waves propagating in the spiral is due to the ohmic losses of the currents flowing in the spiral power losses per turn are as follows p i 2 r 9 if the currents are expressed in amperes and resistance in ohms the dimension p is represented in watts let us calculate the resistance of the coil r 2 r 0 dline we assume that the coil is made of copper then 1 7 10 6 ohm cm is the resistivity of copper r 0 is the radius of the spiral turn r 0 in 2 cm is the initial radius of the spiral winding r 0 fin 1 cm is the final radius c 2 1 2 is the depth of the skin layer for copper 5 4 1017 s 1 2 f 0 f 0 10 8 mhz is the acceleration frequency let us assume that the thickness of the tape wound onto the spiral equals dline 0 1 cm instead of currents it is convenient to substitute in 9 the magnetic fields associated with the currents i 2 1 226 2 n 2 hz 2 10 where the dimension hz is presented in the gaussian form n 1 h is the number of turns per centimeter of length h is a pitch in the winding because one centimeter of the winding includes n turns wound onto
