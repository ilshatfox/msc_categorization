computing the radiation profiles of tightly spherically focused higher order electromagnetic beams of vortex nature are derived stemming from a vectorial analysis with the complex source point method this solution termed as a high order quasi gaussian qg vortex beam exactly satisfies the vector helmholtz and maxwell s equations it is characterized by a nonzero integer degree and order n m respectively an arbitrary waist w 0 a diffraction convergence length known as the rayleigh range zr and an azimuthal phase dependency in the form of a complex exponential corresponding to a vortex beam an attractive feature of the high order solution is the rigorous description of strongly focused or strongly divergent vortex wave fields without the need of neither the higher order corrections nor the numerically intensive methods closed form expressions and computational results illustrate the analysis and some properties of the high order qg vortex beams based on the axial and transverse polarization schemes of the vector potentials with emphasis on the beam waist pacs number s 41 20 jb 42 25 bs 42 15 dp 42 25 fx 02 90 p i introduction modeling the beam forming 1 of tightly focused beams 2 6 is a subject of particular interest in electromagnetic em optical acoustical research which received significant attention in the development of imaging microscopes and other devices for particle manipulation and medical imaging usually the predictions using numerical integration methods commonly performed by means of the angular spectrum method of plane waves 7 10 are computationally intensive requiring the evaluation of a double integration procedure that can be time consuming higher order corrections 11 13 have been also suggested which may provide an approximate solution with minimal numerical errors if a set of parameters is carefully chosen nevertheless the lack of an exact solution for the description of tightly focused beams without any approximation provided the impetus to further extend a method based on the complex source point csp formalism 14 20 note the misprint in eq 3 of 20 as written eq 3 is not a proper solution of the helmholtz equation since the angle is real as given in eq 2 the polar angle in eq 3 should have been expressed as a complex angle given after eq 1 in the following and introduce a solution corresponding to a fundamental lowest order quasi gaussian qg beam that is an exact solution of the helmholtz equation and maxwell s equations 21 in this work a generalized spherical vectorial solution of vortex nature that encompasses the lowest order result 21 see also the cylindrical counterpart solution in 22 is provided for which the degree and order n m 0 0 vector solutions which take into account the vector character of the field and its polarization are necessary for the description of em fields 23 especially when the wavelength is in the order of the beam waist moreover it is of particular importance to develop exact vortex solutions that are applicable to the computation of tightly focused or strongly divergent wave fields without any approximations nor the need for the higher order corrections usually required for gaussian beams 11 12 24 particularly for the computation of the beam shape coefficients bscs 25 used to obtain a priori information on the arbitrary scattering 26 29 radiation force 30 31 orbital and angular spin momentum 32 and torque 30 in particle sizing particle manipulation and optical tweezers to name a few applications unlike the lowest order result 21 the present solutions are fundamentally different as they carry an angular momentum 32 33 which sets a particle or a collection of particles into rotation by inducing a radiation torque 30 although previous vectorial analyses of vortex 28 34 37 and non vortex 38 40 beams of bessel type have been developed the beams were considered ideally non fig 1 geometry of the problem 2 diffracting in an unbounded space or in other words of infinite extent the present analysis starts by considering the general solution to the helmholtz equation in spherical coordinates based on the method of separation of variables i e eq 42 in 18 the same method can be also applied using the csp formalism eq 22 in 16 14 15 18 19 41 43 and the result remains an exact solution of the helmholtz equation the effect of having the description of a generalized solution in a complex coordinates system which may appear at first glance a simple artifice has a major physical meaning in the description of evanescent waves 44 and the production of finite directional beams 17 it is noted that the solutions presented in 16 18 can be interpreted as a generalized set of spherical harmonics centered on a csp however such solutions are singular at the csp and may not be used to describe a physically realizable wave field the removal of this singularity can be accomplished by introducing a sink in addition to the point source 45 46 the sink being identical in amplitude and opposite in sign 47 the vectorial solution termed here a spherical quasi gaussian qg vortex beam to make a distinction from the paraxial gaussian solution used in conventional laser beams consists of products of nonsingular spherical bessel functions of the first kind and associated legendre functions with a complex exponential phase dependency on the azimuthal angle ii method a magnetic vector potential field ap x describing an exact solution of the vector wave equation i e the source free helmholtz equation and polarized along the x direction is defined such that 47 0 qg cos r vortex p x nm m i mkz n n a e j p e a x x 1 where the time dependence in the form of i t e is suppressed from eq 1 for convenience x is the unitary vector along the transverse x direction a 0 is the characteristic amplitude rkze is a normalization constant the parameter kr n j is the spherical bessel function of the first kind m n p are the associated legendre functions of integer degree n and order m 2 2 2 r x y z 1 cos z r 1 tan y x 0 z z z and 2 0 2 r kwz where w 0 is the beam waist 0 r izz and zr is the rayleigh range fig 1 the analysis with complex angles introduces a representation for the field s characteristics which allows determining the direction of propagation as well as field attenuation interpretations 44 moreover the complex distance function r is multi valued in this case four valued fig 3 color online isosurface plots corresponding to a qg 31 vortex beam of 1 st order left panel and a qg 33 vortex beam of 3 rd order right panel with a doughnut shape fig 2 color online axial along the direction z and cross sectional x y plane magnitude and phase plots for qg 31 1 st row and qg 33 2 nd row for kw 0 0 1 corresponding to a strongly focused or strongly divergent beam the units along the axes are in mm fig 4 color online the same as in fig 2 however kw 0 7 3 with branch point singularities on the circle defined by 2 2 2 0 r x y z z a branch line or cut has to be introduced to make it single valued 48 here the branch cut is chosen such that 2 2 2 0 r x y z z for which the complex distance function is continuous at all points except the branch cut it is noted that the azimuthal dependence in eq 1 is expressed under the form of a complex exponential function which represents a vector potential of vortex nature eq 1 is an exact solution of the vector helmholtz equation and the introduction of a sink along with an appropriate choice of the branch cut such that 2 2 2 0 r x y z z makes this particular expression free from any singularities at r 0 unlike the spherical hankel functions the spherical bessel functions are finite at r 0 the cost of this choice however is that the csp beam as given by eq 1 which propagates along the z direction respectively possesses a weak field component propagating backwards in the z direction respectively 45 to illustrate this type of vortex beams the magnitude and phase profiles of the vector potential given by eq 1 are computed for two given pairs n m 3 1 and 3 3 respectively two examples are chosen for which the value of kw 0 are selected to be kw 0 0 1 corresponding to a tightly focused or strongly divergent beam and kw 0 7 corresponding to a quasi collimated beam the parameter k 25 10 3 m 1 and the axial z and transverse x y coordinates are varied by increments of x y z 10 3 mm the panels in fig 2 show the comparison of both magnitude and phase profiles for qg beams of 3 rd degree n 3 and 1 st m 1 and 3 rd m 3 orders for a tightly focused or tightly divergent beam i e kw 0 0 1 the vortex nature of the beam is clearly manifested in the phase plot 3 rd column that varies in the cross sectional plane according to the order of the beam moreover the magnitude plots displayed in the central panels i e cross sectional plane x y show close similarity on the other hand the axial plots 1 st column show quite distinct features of the qg vortex beams to better visualize the features isosurface plots corresponding to the qg vortex beam of 3 rd degree and 1 st order qg 31 1 st column 1 st row in fig 2 and the 3 rd degree and 3 rd order qg 33 1 st column 2 nd row in fig 2 are displayed in fig 3 the effect of changing the size parameter kw 0 7 which corresponds to quasi collimated beams is displayed in fig 4 one clearly notices the difference in the beam shape by comparing the results with figs 2 and 3 as well as the diameter increase of the hollow region when the order of the beam increases this behavior has been previously observed for high order bessel vortex beams 49 it is however important to note that the em field has an intrinsic vector structure thus for a complete description of the qg vortex beams an electric and magnetic field should be defined using the vector potential given by eq 1 to account for the vector nature of the waves using lorenz gauge condition 50 a magnetic field hp is defined as 1 2 p x p a h 2 where is the dielectric constant of the medium thus from maxwell s equations and eq 2 the electric field is expressed as 2 p p x p xik k e a a 3 substituting eq 1 into eqs 2 and 3 leads to the determination of the electromagnetic field components however one notices an asymmetry in the mathematical expressions of the electric and magnetic field components inappropriate in the physical description of symmetric beams therefore the general physical description of beams in free space with no imposed boundary conditions requires using the dual field setup 42 to produce symmetrical behaviors in the em field s components the mathematical operation using the dual field consists of defining another electric vector potential aq y polarized along the negative or positive transverse y direction such that qg vortex nmq y a y 4 where y is the unitary vector along the y direction note here that the dual field setup procedure may not be required for the description of transverse modes 51 with specific boundary conditions imposed on the wave field an electric field eq may be therefore defined as q y q a e 5 thus from maxwell s equations and eq 5 the magnetic field is expressed as 1 2 2 i q q y q yk k h a a 6 in the final mathematical procedure the solution of eqs 2 and 3 is added to the solution of eqs 5 and 6 and dividing the end result by two leads to the spatial cartesian components for a quasi gaussian vortex beam of any integer degree n and order m which are expressed as 4 2 2 2 2 2 24 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 4 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 32 2 cos 1 2 cos 4 2 co r n nm nm n nm nm n nn nm m i m kz mx y n

focused or strongly divergent beam the 1 st and 2 nd rows correspond to the x y configuration whereas the 3 rd and 4 th rows correspond to the z z configuration the units along the axes are in mm 6 where the superscript x y in the em field s components i e eqs 7 12 denotes the polarization state of the vector potentials ap x and aq y respectively moreover the functions appearing in these

lasers 53 56 thus the aim here is to further extend the analysis to the case where the vector potentials are polarized along the axial directions z by deriving closed form expressions for the em field s components in this configuration thus a vector potential field ap z denoting an exact solution of the helmholtz eqaution and polarized along the z direction is expressed as qg vortex p z nm a z 14 where qg vortex nm is given by eq 1 and z is the unitary vector along the z direction following the procedure as given by eqs 2 6 after defining another vector potential polarized along the negative axial direction as qg vortex nmq z a z 15 and manipulating the results the spatial cartesian components for a spherical quasi gaussian vortex beam of any integer degree n and order m in the z z polarization scheme are found to be fig 6 color online the same as in fig 5 but the size parameter is kw 0 7 corresponding to a quasi collimated beam 7 4 2 2 0 2 42 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 4 2 2 2 2 cos 24 cos

are computed for the pair n m 3 1 in the simulations two values of the size parameter kw 0 are selected to be kw 0 0 1 fig 5 corresponding to a tightly focused or strongly divergent beam and kw 0 7 fig 6 corresponding to a quasi collimated beam the parameter k 25 10 3 m 1 and the axial z and transverse x y coordinates are varied by increments of x y z 10 3 mm 8 comparisons of the 1 st with the 3

notices the spatial distributions in the cross sectional plane for the components 31 x y x e and 31 x y z e 2 nd row 1 st and 5 th panel respectively which show an asymmetry in the central part of the plots only in the transverse x y polarization state the central area of the beam appears to be slightly rotated in the plane so that the symmetry is broken this is a characteristic of the qg 31 vortex beam for kw 0 0 1 this antisymmetry is removed when the beam becomes more directional as displayed in fig 6 2 nd row 1 st and 5 th panel respectively for kw 0 7 moreover evolutions of the components 31 z z x e and 31 z z y e 4 th row are perceived the null observed when kw 0 0 1 fig 5 4 th row 1 st and 3 rd panel is transformed into a maximum in magnitude with a rotation in the transverse plane fig 6 4 th row 1 st and 3 rd panel as mentioned previously the high order qg vortex beams carry both linear and angular momenta responsible for the production of a radiation force and torque 30 on a particle a recent analysis dealing with a coherent superposition of bessel beams 37 has shown that both linear and angular momentum density fluxes may reverse sign at particular values of the half cone angle of the beam these behaviors anticipate the production of a tractor beam where particulate matter may be pulled back toward the source and a spinning reversal effect in which particulate matter may rotate with opposite handedness to the beam for the present case of high order qg vortex beams the analysis 37 can be directly extended to evaluate the linear and angular momentum density fluxes with particular emphasis on the dimensionless waist kw 0 since the em components of the qg vortex beam are now available i e eqs 7 12 16 21 further investigations focused on evaluating the em radiation force and torque on a particle are beyond the scope of the present study and will be the subject of future research iii conclusion in summary the vector wave properties for a csp vortex solution representing tightly spherically focused beams are investigated particular emphasis is given on the polarizations of the electric and magnetic vector potentials which produce distinct components for the em field with vortex behavior in addition the effect of increasing the beam waist produces quasi collimated beams in the broad sense the field s expressions are exact solutions of maxwell s equations and are obtained without any approximations potential use of the solutions is in modeling strongly focused or quasi collimated beams without the need of numerical integration procedures nor the higher order corrections other potential application is the accurate computation of the beam shape coefficients used in the generalized lorenz mie theories glmts for evaluating the arbitrary scattering forces and torques on particles using tightly focused laser vortex beams 1 a ciattoni c conti and p di porto phys rev e 69 036608 2004 2 s a self appl opt 22 658 1983 3 r dorn s
