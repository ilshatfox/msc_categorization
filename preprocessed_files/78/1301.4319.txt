the combination of four laser wavelengths in order to maximize both color gamut and efficacy to produce the color white firstly an analytic method to calculate efficacy as function of both four laser wavelengths and four laser powers is derived secondly we provide a new way to present the results by providing the diagram efficacy vs color gamut area that summarizes the performance of any wavelength combination for projection purposes the results indicate that the maximal efficacy for the d 65 white is only achievable by using a suitable combination of both laser power ratios and wavelengths pacs numbers mobile projection devices usually known as picopro jectors should be designed to maximize their luminous efficacy this is for two main reasons firstly being ei ther stand alone devices or embedded in other products they are likely to be powered by battery and lifetime an important factor 1 secondly the increasing use of lasers to project images calls for a consideration of eye safety issues 2 the brightness of the projected im age may be limited by the class ii accessible emission limit there is reason to believe that current laser beam scanning picoprojector technology is already close to the power ceiling based on eye safety limits 3 consequently it would be desirable to improve luminous efficacy to in crease the output luminous flux for the same eye safe optical power limit the relationship between the choice of laser wave lengths and the resulting luminous efficacy has been dis cussed in the literature 4 6 here we present the oppor tunity to increase luminous efficacy by adding a fourth laser wavelength usually the three primary wavelengths of a laser display offer a wide color gamut and so the em phasis in this study has been to maximize the safe lumi nous flux whilst maintaining the gamut rather than in creasing the gamut utilization of additional wavelengths or colors in display and illumination applications is how ever not new reasons for adding one or more additional colors have traditionally been for improved gamut and or improved brightness and have usually applied to liquid crystal display applications brown et al 7 have dis cussed adding a white pixel to the red green and blue pix els of an lcd display to increase the brightness of a dis play sharp has recently launched a four color television with claims of increased brightness and color gamut 8 here we present a study of the choices of four laser wavelengths to optimize luminous efficacy for the projec tion of the cie standard illuminant d 65 daylight white since this is a display application the basis for color mix ing calculations is the set of 1964 10 cie color matching functions 9 the cie recommends the use of the color matching functions of the cie 1964 supplementary stan dard colorimetric observer whenever correlation with visual color matching of fields of angular subtense greater than about 4 at the eye of the observer is desired it has also been noted in the literature that in the optimiza tion of the efficacy of a 3 wavelength projector there is a trade off with the color gamut 2 for this reason in this study we compare the efficacy with the color gamut area as presented on the cie 1976 ucs uniform chromaticity scale diagram the tristimulus values x y and z are determined from the color matching functions x y and z of a given illuminant spectral power distribution p as follows gn 0 p gn d 1 where gn and gn represent the sequences x y z and x y z respectively for the case of a three wavelength combination if we define a matrix m as m x r x g x b y r y g y b z r z g z b 2 the power of red green and blue lasers can be calculated by prgb m 1 w 3 where the vector w contains the x y and z chromaticity coordinates of white d 65 point and the wavelengths r g and b in the framework of the cie 1964 10 color matching functions the coordinates x y and z are 0 31382 0 331 and 0 35518 respectively prgb describes the unique solution of the combination of relative powers of the red green and blue wavelengths to produce d 65 white for a four wavelength combination there is no sin gle solution the combination of four colors is dependent on the relative power of the fourth wavelength as will be demonstrated this fourth wavelength is consistently found to be in the yellow region and so is represented http arxiv org abs 1301 4319 v 1 2 as y to calculate the four color combination we first define a new vector w w xw pyx y yw pyy y zw pyz y 4 expression 3 can be now rewritten in terms of w for the case of a four wavelength combination as follows prgb y py m 1 w 5 in the former expression prgb depends on py and y as well if we redefine as the four dimensional vector r g b y the power vector containing the contribution of all laser sources might be written as follows p pr py pg py pb py py 6 since the combination of colors is in terms of relative powers we arbitrarily choose to define the powers of each wavelength with respect to the blue wavelength hence we define a new power vector p as p pb thus if values for the components red green blue and yellow of the vector and the ratio py pb are selected expression 5 provides a unique result for the ratios pr pb and pg pb the total power normalized by pb is p t pr pb pg pb 1 py pb 7 in the same way using the values pr pb pg pb and py pb a normalized flux l t can be obtained so the efficacy is eff l t p t lt pt 8 this method allows us to calculate the efficacy by choos ing the relative power of the yellow source with respect to the blue source since the cie 1976 chromaticity diagram is known to be perceptively relatively linear 10 it is appropriate to quantify the extent of the color gamut as the enclosed area as represented on this plot 5 in doing so any trade off between efficacy and gamut can be evaluated to do this we firstly have to calculate the x y and z coordinates for each laser wavelength these coordinates can be obtained from the following expression gn gn 3 n 1 gn 9 where gn represent one element of the sequence x y z from this set of coordinates the u and v of the cie 1976 chart are obtained as follows u 4 x 3 12 y 2 x 10 v 9 y 3 12 y 2 x 11 fig 1 left part cie 1931 chart right part cie 1976 chart in both graphs achievable color gamuts by the dci and hdtv input signals have been plotted dashed line cor responds to the optimal solution found here using the laser wavelengths 630 nm 520 nm 441 nm and 563 nm the color gamut area can be considered as a tri angle formed by the coordinates u r v r u g v g and u b v b of the red green and blue lasers respectively if g 520 nm as fig 1 shows the yellow coordinates are in this case almost on the line formed by the green and red coordinates and therefore the contribution of the yellow laser to the formation of a more complex area can be neglected for more simplicity thus under this ap proximation the color gamut area a is a 1 2 u b v r v g u g v b v r u r v g v b 12 in order to obtain solutions that could be of practi cal interest and that can be compared with current dis play devices we have selected wavelength ranges that try to cover the most important signal inputs i e dci and hdtv signal inputs plotted in fig 1 11 12 in this way a laser projector could display the color spec trum managed by these inputs the selected wave length ranges are as follows 600 nm r 630 nm 520 nm g 550 nm 440 nm b 470 nm and 560 nm y 590 nm fig 2 contains the positive solutions of over 21 mil lion calculations of equation 5 at the above specified wavelength ranges and several power ratios py pb the 3 fig 2 efficacy of the white point d 65 as function of the color gamut area for different ratios of the yellow laser power to the blue laser power the big isolated circle denotes the commercial projector described in the text efficacy gamut trade off of a three color mix is clear as the power of the fourth wavelength is increased the effi cacy of the white point d 65 increases at the wavelengths studied if we choose a figure of merit of the prod uct of efficacy and color gamut area the most optimum value occurs at py pb 1 8 pr pb 9 10 3 and pg pb 7 10 3 and at the wavelengths 630 nm of the red laser 520 nm of the green laser 441 nm of the blue laser and 563 nm of the yellow laser which produce an efficacy of 449 7 lm w since the power needed for the formation of d 65 white with the red and green laser is negligible the calculation results indicate that this choice for both optimum efficacy and color gamut area is mainly obtained with the contributions of the blue and yellow laser in the u v space this means that the chromatic ity coordinate of the d 65 white point is on the straight line formed by the blue laser and yellow laser coordinates note that the red and green wavelengths can be consid ered in the developed method as free variables as well and therefore are obtained as the best optimum wavelengths which together with the blue wavelength maximize the color gamut area in expression 12 by comparison a commercially available three color picoprojector microvision show wx 13 with wave lengths of 442 nm 532 nm and 642 nm has an efficacy of 254 lm w the performance of this device has been plotted in fig 2 by means of the coordinates of the effi cacy and color gamut area an addition of a yellow laser at 564 nm py 1 76 pb would increase the efficacy by 77 to 451 lm w one additional point is worth mentioning fig 2 shows that there is a very distinct upper limit to the efficacy of any color mix this occurs at 455 lm w insofar as the photopic curve presents the maximum efficacy for a single wavelength 683 lm w at 555 nm 455 lm w has to be understood to be the maximum efficacy with which the color white d 65 point can be projected by any combination of illumination sources the shape of the areas shown in fig 2 depends on the wavelength ranges used in fact if we decrease the color gamut area by using other wavelength ranges closer to the d 65 white point in the u v space the efficacy would increase up to the maximum value of 455 lm w but at the cost of the color gamut area limiting the capability for obtaining different colors in conclusion we have derived a formulation that per mits to calculate the best combination of four wave lengths and powers for laser projection maximizing both color gamut area and efficacy of the d 65 white point the results show that the maximal efficacy projected us ing the most common video input signals can be only achieved by adding a fourth laser wavelength combi nation of three laser wavelengths would produce less ef ficacy at suitable color gamuts for projection the best selection of wavelengths and powers in this framework is found at the wavelengths 630 nm 520 nm 441 nm and 563 nm for the red green blue and yellow lasers and the power ratio py pb 1 8 that would produce an efficacy of 449 7 lm w when forming a d 65 white these con clusions and results represent a guideline for the future development of picoprojectors and cinema projectors in which particular emphasis is placed on the use of high laser power
