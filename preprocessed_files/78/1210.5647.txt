bogolyubov institute for theoretical physics national academy of sciences of ukraine 14 b metrologichna str kyiv 143 ukraine 03680 dated september 13 2021 the local field approach and kinetic equation method is applied to calculate the surface plasmon radiative damping in a spheroidal metal nanoparticle embedded in any dielectric media the radia tive damping of the surface plasmon resonance as a function of the particle radius shape dielectric constant of the surrounding medium and the light frequency is studied in detail it is found that the radiative damping grows quadratically with the particle radius and oscillates with altering both the particle size and the dielectric constant of a surrounding medium much attention is paid to the electron surface scattering contribution to the plasmon decay all calculations of the radiative damping are illustrated by examples on the au and na nanoparticles pacs numbers 78 67 bf 68 49 jk 73 23 b 78 67 n 52 25 os 36 40 vz 25 20 dc 52 25 os 78 47 p i introduction the surface plasmons sps excited by an electro magnetic radiation falling on a metal nanoparticle mn are still of great fundamental interest 1 3 since their pro nounced local resonances whose position shape and in tensity can be tuned over wide spectral range by varying the size and shape of the mns or by changing the sur rounding medium once excited plasmon oscillations can damp non radiatively by absorption caused by electron phonon in teractions and or radiatively by the resonant scatter ing process 4 5 the electron phonon interaction with de creasing mn size becomes more and more ineffective due to kinematical restrictions imposed on the energy momentum conservation laws 6 nevertheless the line broadening has been observed in experiments with mns scattering and absorption 3 7 14 this means that besides electron phonon interaction the other damping mecha nisms should be studied as well in order to interpret the observed sp line broadening usually both the surface and the radiative damping mechanisms play an important role in the sp decay in ref 14 it was shown that both the electron surface scat tering and radiative damping can make significant con tribution to the linewidth the full width at a half of maximum of the surface plasmon resonance spr in the mns of a smaller radii the penetration depth of the plasmon field reduces and becomes more localized near the surface 5 this is due to the fact that the electron screening is increased as the particle radius is reduced as a result the bulk induced loss processes play only a minor role and the electronic excitations generated by the surface potential dominate on the other hand if elec trons are confined in nanoparticles where the mean free path mfp of the electrons becomes comparable with email ngrigor bitp kiev ua the size of the particles the electron surface scattering comes into play 5 and the surface acts as an additional scatterer the radiative damping of the spr is an important parameter since it would help to analyze the specificity of the transformation of the collective electron oscillation energy into the optical far field the interest to treat of the spr and radiative damp ing is maintained as well by the investigation of the local field enhancement an effect which increases the inten sity of the incident light near the mns surface by sev eral orders of magnitude 4 5 since a lot of devices in corporating mns gains from this effect is treated as a main parameter in applications such as field concen tration for nanopatterning with nanowires 15 plasmonic nanolithography 16 and near field optical microscopy 17 astigmatic optical tweezers 18 surface enhanced raman scattering 19 etc the damping of spr in mns previously has been well studied theoretically 20 26 the influence of a nearby sur face on the plasmon resonance of a metallic nanoparticle of finite size has been studied in the work 20 with an account for the effects of both radiative and evanescent surface reflected waves in ref 21 the oscillations of the plasmon linewidth as a function of the radius of the nanoparticles were obtained from numerical calculations based on the time dependent local density approximation without regard for radiative damping the temperature effect on the radiative lifetime of the surface plasmon was studied in the work 22 to evaluate size and shape dependent dielectric functions and extinction spectra for mns with various shape the different empirical formulas were proposed for electron mfp 23 the radiative damping calculated in refs 24 26 is proportional to the product of the polarizability propor tional to particle volume times k 3 2 3 where k is wave number and is the wavelength the calculations have been conducted in the electrostatic approximation assuming v 3 1 where v is the mn volume in the works mentioned above was dropped from ac http arxiv org abs 1210 5647 v 1 2 count the fact that the role of an external electric field which causes the dipole oscillations of electrons and the radiative damping can play the inner electric field in mn besides in these works the surface and radiative decay have not been considered simultaneously for non spherical mn the purpose of the present paper is to calculate the radiative damping of the surface plasmon under the ef fect of inner electric field for the case when the mfp of the electrons is larger than the particle size and their scattering on the particle surface plays an important role within the framework of a local field approach and the kinetic equation method we have found that the linewidth of spr increases quadratically with the parti cle radius and exhibits oscillations as a function of the nanoparticle radius and the refractive index of a sur rounding medium the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section ii the theoretical background to the problem is presented section iii is devoted to the study of radiative damping section iv contains the calculation of the conductivity tensor and the discussion of obtained results section v contains the summary and conclusions ii surface plasmon linewidth an interaction of light with a mn embedded in a medium is studied in the framework of classical optics assuming that the particle and the medium are contin uous homogeneous and characterized by their dielec tric function to overcome the problem connected with an inhomogeneous line broadening due to the size and shape distribution within the particle ensemble we re strict ourselves only to a single mn which directly yields the homogeneous linewidth 9 27 in general the linewidth can be decomposed into con tributions from the bulk dielectric constant surface scat tering and radiative damping 4 b s rad in the classical case of free electrons in bulk metal the damping b is due to the inelastic scattering of the electrons on phonons lattice defects or impurities refers to the electron collision frequency which shorten the mfp 28 in this case the relation b f l holds where f is the fermi velocity and l is the mfp of conduction electrons in the bulk when the mn radius tends to infinity similarly to estimate the surface effect in electron surface scattering the following empirical relation 5 23 s a f leff 1 is often used where a is a phenomenological factor and leff is a reduced effective mfp for the sphere the clas sical theory gives leff r for an isotropic scattering or leff 4 r 3 for a diffusive scattering while the quantum theory in a box model yields leff 1 16 r or leff 1 33 r where r is the radius of a spherical mn 23 the bulk scattering does not cause appreciable attenu ation for the high frequency case when 1 where is the relaxation time on the other hand the contribu tion to damping from surface scattering is negligible only if l 2 r 1 2 2 thus the surface contribution is important if max 1 l 2 r the radiative contribution can be estimated with the help of the following expression 9 rad 2 kv 2 where v is the nanoparticle volume and k is an another phenomenological constant to be taken from the experi mental data to account both the surface and the radiative ef fects for a mn embedded in a homogeneous transparent medium the dielectric permittivity 14 23 inter 1 2 pl 2 b s rad 2 2 pl b s rad 2 b s rad 2 3 is usually used where and are respectively the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function of the par ticle material inter accounts for the interband electron transitions 2 pl 4 nee 2 m and ne refers to the elec tron concentration the expression in the parentheses is applied for the intraband electron transitions 29 one can see that the effect of the surface is reduced simply to the addition of a term s s leff in the denominator of eq 3 in the form of eq 1 and the radiative effect is accounted simply by the term r in the same denominator formulae 1 and 2 can be applied only to the mns of a spherical shape in the case when the mfp of electrons l is smaller than the particle size d if the shape of mn differs from the spherical one or the inequality l 2 r takes place then the expressions 1 and 2 can no longer be used we will consider the mns with a moderate sizes for whose on the one hand the condition l 2 r is still fulfilled the collisions of the conduction electrons with the particle surface remains to be an important relax ation process and on the other hand with the sizes enough large to account for the dissipation of the elec tron energy due to the emission of electromagnetic waves by plasmons so called radiation damping iii radiative damping the problem of a damping of the electron energy due to the radiation of a portion of the collective electron oscillation energy into the optical far field has been ex tensively studied in the literature 5 9 11 22 25 as we can see from eq 1 the surface damping de pends on a particle size the relative contributions from the radiative damping through the resonant scattering and absorption also strongly depend on the particle size 3 in particular it is known 4 5 that the plasmon absorption is the only process taken place in small particles whereas both the absorption and the scattering are present in large particles with the latter becoming more dominant as the particle size increases the phenomenon is based on an interplay of the dissipative and radiative damping an another assumption that the wavelength of the ab sorbing light is far above the characteristic size of the nanoparticle about 25 nm for gold particles 5 allows us to treat the mn as being immersed in a spatial uniform but oscillating in time electric field this implies that em field around the mn can be considered as homoge neous and across the particle as uniform such that all the conduction electrons move in phase producing only dipole type oscillations the external electric field e 0 exp i t induces an inner potential electric field ein inside the particle which is coordinate independent the field ein can be linearly expressed in terms of e 0 by employing the de polarization tensor in terms of principal axes the depo larization tensor which coincide with with the principal axes of the ellipsoid the relation between components of external and inner fields look as 4 e 0 j ej in 1 lj m 1 4 ej in are the components of the electric field inside the mn and lj are the principal value of the j th compo nent of the depolarization tensor that is also known as a geometric factors the explicit expressions of lj for a mn with a particular shape can be found elesewhere see e g refs 30 4 and 31 the complex dielec tric permittivity of the particle material is denoted by and m refers to the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium electrons are accelerated in the presence of an electric field inside the mn it is well known from the classical electrodynamics 32 that accelerated charges emit electro magnetic radiation in all directions to calculate the line broadening that is entirely caused by an increase of rad due to the radiative effect we will use the time depen dence of a classical dipole oscillator the force of a decel erative radiation of a dipole under an inner electric field eq 4 can be represented as frad t 2 e 3 c 3 m 1 l m 1 d t 5 where d is the mn dipole moment the minus sign means that this force is opposit to the dipole moment direction in the case of one electron and a medium with m 1 eq 5 transforms into the well known expressions from the classical electrodynamics 32 the linewidth due to the radiative damping of dipole vi brations can be expressed through the f by means of rad e m im frad t d t n 6 where n v ne is the number of free electrons in the mn and v refers to the particle volume it is necessary to underline here that the radiation damping rate is pro portional to the total number of oscillating electrons in mn supposing d t d 0 exp i t we obtain for j th component of a radiative linewidth the following expres sion j rad 2 3 e 2 2 mc 3 n m im 1 lj jj m 1 7 putting here jj m we get known expression e g from ref 22 for the sake of simplicity we will assume that the di electric matrix has no influence on the mn and can be characterized by m const m m 0 8 i e the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium is assumed to be frequency independent however it may happen in some actual cases that the dielectric medium is strongly absorptive at frequencies below the pl if that is the case then the m is strongly dependent on frequency and contributes to the attenuation of the oscil lations with accounting for the dielectric matrix prop erties given by eq 8 eq 7 can be rewritten as j rad 2 3 e 2 2 mc 3 nlj jj m 9 if one will consider the case of the frequency close to the frequency of the bulk plasma oscillations of electrons in metal pl then the imaginary part of the dielectric function tensor for free electron gas can be expressed within the drude sommerfeld model as 4 5 28 jj 4 jj 10 where jj is the principal components of the real part of the conductivity tensor taking into account the expres sion 10 we get j rad 8 3 e 2 mc 3 nlj jj m 11 the real part of the conductivity tensor can be ex pressed through the imaginary part of the polarizability tensor jj by means of jj v m 1 lj m 1 2 im jj 12 in the case of the spr one can use in eq 3 for nonspherical mns the frequency sp pl 1 lj 1 n 2 13 4 here n 2 m and 1 inter is the high frequency dielectric constant due to interband and core transitions of the inner electrons in a mn s material there are different possibilities to calculate jj for the different frequency regime below we will demon strate how to calculate the jj as applied to the nanopar ticle case iv calculation of jj to calculate the tensor jj we will use the kinetic equa tions method benefit of this method is that it permits one to study the effect of the particle shape on the mea sured physical values second it enables us to investigate the particles whose sizes are those that the particle sur face start to play an important role a diffuse boundary scattering is assumed to be a good approximation in this case the simplest form of a nonspherical shape is a spheroid we restrict ourselves to the nanoparticles with a spheroidal shape only applying the mentioned method we have found 33 that the components of the conductiv ity tensor for light polarized along or across the rotation axis of a spheroidal mn are 9 2 pl 16 re 1 i 2 0 sin cos 2 1 2 sin 3 d f 14 where is the electron collision frequency and is the angle between rotation axes of the spheroid and direc tion of an electron velocity here and below the upper lower symbol in the parentheses on the left hand side of eq 14 corresponds to the upper lower expression in the parentheses on the right hand side of this equation the subscript f means that the electron velocity in the final expressions should be taken on the fermi surface the complex function entering in eq 14 has the form q q 4 q 2 1 1 q e q 15 where q 4 3 2 q 4 q 3 q 2 r i 16 one can see from eq 16 that the q is governed by the deformed electron velocity which in the case of a spheroidal mn takes the form r sin r 2 cos r 2 17 where refers to the electron velocity in a spherical par ticle with radius r r and r are the spheroid semi axes directed along and across the spheroid rotation axis respectively 34 the semiaxes are connected to the radius of sphere r of an equivalent volume through the relation r 3 r r 2 the last summand in eq 15 represents the oscilla tion part of the function and the first one refers to its smooth part the function in eq 15 varies with the angle because the parameter q becomes dependent on the angle for a spheroidal particle namely q 2 f i cos 2 r 2 sin 2 r 2 18 a conductivity tensor in high frequency limit let us introduce the frequency of electron oscillations between particle walls as s f 2 r 19 depending on sizes of mn its shape and temperature the variety of relations between frequencies s and pl can be achieved for example for the na nanoparticle with the radius of r 2 a s pl on the other hand with r 126 a the electron oscillation frequency becomes s where 4 24 1013 s 1 as is estimated for the na at 3000 k this leads to different expressions for which can be used in eq 11 for calculation of the plasmon linewidth below we will consider the case when the contribution of the bulk damping to the radiative plasmon linewidth of spr is neglected the components of the conductivity tensor for a spheroidal mn in the highfrequency hf limit s and s can be represented as 35 9 32 pl 2 f r ep ep 20 where r rx 1 3 x r r is a spheroid semi axis directed across to the spheroid rotation axis and ep and ep are some smooth functions 36 dependent only on the spheroid eccentricity ep 1 x 2 a prolate spheroid or ep x 2 1 an oblate one one can use the following asymptotic expressions for functions x and x in the cases of both the extremely small or the large axial ratio respectively x 8 3 x 2 16 for a prolate spheroid x 2 1 4 x for an oblate spheroid x 3 16 x 2 32 for a prolate spheroid x 4 1 4 ln 2 x 8 x for an oblate spheroid 21 if one consider the nanowires and nanorods which can be reasonably approximated as prolate spheroids then 5 one can put 8 and 3 16 with a sufficient degree of accuracy in the case of mns with a spherical shape 2 3 1 radiative damping for spheroidal mn in hf limit in the highfrequency limit when eq 20 can be ap plied for two components of the linewidth of a spheroidal mn embedded in a medium with m we obtain the fol lowing equation rad sp 3 4 e 2 2 pl m c 3 n f r m l ep ep 22 where explicit expressions for ep and ep can be found in ref 36 accounting for n 4 3 r r 2 ne m 3 e 2 2 plr r 2 23 eq 22 at the resonance frequency 13 takes the form rad sp 3 pl 4 c 3 fr r l 2 n 2 n 2 ep ep 24 the depolarization coefficients l for spheroidal mn can be found elsewhere 4 5 in the case of mns with a very elongated shape x 1 they can be expressed as l x x 2 ln 2 x x 4 1 l x 1 l x 2 25 2 radiative damping for a spherical mn in hf limit in the case of mn with a spherical shape r r r and one can put the depolarization factor equal to l l 1 3 in eqs 4 5 7 13 11 and 22 eq 24 for mn with a spherical shape can be rewrit ten as rad sp 1 18 pl c 3 f r 2 2 n 2 n 2 26 the increase in linewidth from the radiative damping as we can see from eqs 24 and 26 is proportional to the mn surface area this can be understood from the fact that the surface scattering is a solely mechanism for the change of the electron velocity and acceleration we do not account any other radiative mechanisms in our theory as for instance the electron electron collisions the estimations of for the spherical au 9 84 and na 1 14 37 particles with 2 r 400 a embed ded in the vacuum n 1 in accordance with eq 26 give 6 7 and 0 795 mev or 98 and 1209 fs respectively if the mn is embedded in the dielectric media with m 1 then the environment effect ought to be taken into account b environment effect because the effect of an electric field on the embedded nanoparticles becomes weaker in a dielectric media pro portionally to its refractive index the environment effect plays an important role the spectral peculiarities of an environment effect recently were investigated for the ag and au nanoparticles for instance in refs 26 38 in order to study the significance of the radiative linewidth behavior in more general situations as above presented it is necessary to perform the numerical cal culation in eq 11 with the use of a general expression for the conductivity tensor given by eq 14 then the radiative linewidth of spr with an account for eqs 13 and 23 can be expressed in the form rad 8 9 n pl c 3 r r 2 l 1 l 1 n 2 27 it allows to account an other important factor namely the dependence of the radiative damping on the particle shape as already was outlined 4 5 39 any change of the nanoparticle shape from a sphere that introducing of an anisotropy results in the splitting of the spr into two modes a transverse one perpendicular to the spheroid axis of a revolution and a longitudinal one parallel to this axis in fig 1 we illustrate the behavior of the radiative damping components as a function of the medium re fractive index for a fixed particle axes ratio the calculations were conducted for the au nanopar ticle with the use of eqs 27 and 14 and the fol lowing parameters 37 ne 5 9 1022 cm 3 f 1 39 108 cm s pl 1 37 1016 s 1 and 9 84 1 2 3 4 5 6 4 6 8 10 12 r e f r a c t i v e i n d e x n m e v 2 4 6 8 10

the same dependence for two spherical na nanoparticles with the radii of 180 and 200 a solid lines the dashed lines represent the n in the case when the oscillation terms in eq 30 are 6 neglected we observe from fig 1 that both radiative damping components are decreased with increasing the medium refractive index in other words the effect is weaker for higher dielectric constant of environment the more of mn radius or the less the refractive index is the higher is the calculated radiative damping in general the resonance plasmon damping in the pro late au nanoparticle was found to be weaker along the spheroid revolution axis than the one across this axis for the oblate au nanoparticle on the contrary the damping along the revolution axis was stronger than that across this axis this result holds regardless of whether the photo excitation is close to the spr or far from it the resonance peak position is shifted with changing the refractive index of the surrounding medium the spectral direction of the shift depends on a number of factors well studied in earlier publications 4 5 14 26 38 1 radiative plasmon linewidth for a spherical mn in a more general case we consider here the case when the function ceases to depend on the angle then the integration over in eq 14 gives 1 3 and we derive for sph 3 2 pl 16 re q i 28 with q 2 r i taken at f let us choose the case s for illustration after simple algebraic calculations with the use of eqs 15 and 16 we obtain in this case sph 3 8 s 2 pl 2 1 2 s sin s 2 2 s 2 1 cos s 29 substituting eqs 29 and 23 into eq 11 we get sph pl 9 n r pl c 3 1 2 sin 2 2 1 cos 30 with n r 2 r pl f 2 n 2 31 one can see from eq 30 that the radiative damping in a spherical mn oscillates with altering of both the radius of mn and or the refractive index of an embedding medium eq 30 at 1 transforms into eq 26 the inset at the fig 1 shows the behavior of the spr linewidth for spherical na nanoparticles with different radii for calculation we use eq 30 and the following parameters ne 2 65 1022 cm 3 f 1 07 108 cm s pl 9 18 1015 s 1 and 1 14 the dashed smooth curves in the inset in fig 1 cor respond to the simple case when both the second and the last terms are neglected in the square brackets of eq 30 in this simple case the radiative linewidth of the spr is decreased with enhancing of a refractive index n of the environment this takes place because the ra diative plasmon decay is weakened in the media with the higher refractive index owing to decrease of an external em field inside the mn as one can see from the inset in fig 1 the oscillations of around its smooth curve make significant correc tions to the smooth picture especially at large n the oscillations are well pronounced for the na nanoparticles with the small radii and are disappeared for np with a larger radii this can be connected with the number of an electron oscillations between particle walls which is decreased as the particle radius is increased these oscillations is damped markedly with n decreasing and practically disappeared at n 2 the damping enhances as the radius of mn becomes larger 2 effect of the particle size figure 2 depicts the behavior of the radiative linewidth of spr as the function of mn radius for some fixed medium refractive indices the calculations were fulfilled for the au nanoparticle with the use of eq 30 and the same numerical parameters as given above as we can see in fig 2 and from eq 30 the is increased quadratically with r dashed lines we sup pose this is due to the fact that the radiative damping in the mn with a spherical shape is proportional to the area of a sphere the growth in occurs slower in the media with a higher refractive index the redaction of radiat ing damping in the media with higher n implies a reduced dephasing of the plasmon mode because the effect of an external electric field on the embedded nanoparticle be comes weaker in a dielectric media with higher refractive index the resonance radiative damping tends to decrease within the nanoparticle the oscillates around a smooth curves with an in crease of the particle radius the period of these oscilla tions is enhanced for the mns embedded in the medium with a higher refractive index the magnitude of these oscillations is the greater the higher refractive index is the oscillations of with r follow the quadratic depen dence as well the inset at the fig 2 shows the same dependence for na nanoparticle embedded in the media with n 1 and n 9 on the oscillations of the sp lifetime as a function of nanoparticle size it was pointed out for the first time in ref 21 where the semiclassical theory was used to evaluate the spr in mns 7 0 100 200 300 400 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 r a d i u s p a r t i c l e r ab

the inset shows the same dependence for na nanoparticle the behavior of at small particle radii r ab 40 in our approach practically does not depend on both the particle radius and the medium refractive index and can be described more precisely in the frame of the quantum theory so far we have considered only radiative processes be low we dwell shortly on the nonradiative processes when the electron scattering in the mn dissipates oscillation energy into heat c linewidth for a nonradiative processes another way for calculation of j rad supposes the knowledge of the value of a nonradiative damping j nonrad that is j rad sca abs j nonrad 32 where sca and abs are the light scattering and absorp tion cross sections respectively the nonradiative damping rate of a sp can be ex pressed as 39 j nonrad 4 lj m lj 1 m jj 33 with the jj given in the section iv eq 33 defines the linewidth or correspondingly the decay time of the plasmon resonance due to electron scattering both from the bulk and from surfaces of the particle in the case of medium with m 1 eq 33 is reduced merely to j nonrad 4 lj jj 34 so the decay time of the plasmon resonance is the opti cal conductivity of the mn at the light frequency multi plied by a geometrical factor to study the nonradiative linewidth for mns with a given lj it is enough to calcu late the real part of the conductivity tensor as a function of frequency as one can see from eq 32 the radiative damping rate start to dominate as the light scattering cross sec tion by mn exceeds the light absorption one in it the calculations for spherical mn in vacuum gives that radius of mn for which both cross sections become comparable each with other in the high frequency limit we found that rhf 3 2 3 4 c f 1 4 c pl 35 for instance r 100 a for au particle at the plasmon frequency pl 3 in the case of low frequencies we have rlf c pl 6 c f m 36 the latter formula gives r 7860 a for au particle em bedded in a medium with m 1 in order to take into account the radiative damping to gether with collisions of free carriers with the mn surface the effective damping rate eff nonrad rad must be introduced for understanding of the decay mechanism of the electron plasma oscillations the knowledge of the decay time is of central importance v summary and conclusions we used a local field approach and a kinetic equation method to study the plasmon resonance linewidth for metal nonspherical nanoparticles embedded in any dielec tric media it enables to calculate the radiative linewidth for mns with different geometry with an account for the light scattering from the particle surfaces the general formula is proposed for a damping rate or a decay time due to electron scattering from the bulk and particle surfaces by means of this formula one can eval uate the linewidth directly through the tensor of optical conductivity of the mn with changing the mns shape from spherical to the spheroidal one the single radiative plasmon resonance splits into two components the longitudinal and a trans verse one to the spheroid rotation axis we found that both the radiative damping components for au nanopar ticle are decreased with increasing the medium refractive index the resonance plasmon damping in the prolate au nanoparticle was found to be weaker along the spheroid revolution axis than that across this axis for na nanoparticle we detect the oscillations of with the refractive index increasing the amplitude of 8 these oscillations enhances for media with higher dielec tric constant the oscillations are well pronounced for na nanoparticles with the small radii and are disappeared for na nanoparticles with a larger radii we clearly show for spherical mns that the radiative linewidth of spr enhances quadratically with the parti cle radius increasing the growth in occurs slower in the media with a higher refractive index the oscillates as well with changing in the particle radius the mag nitude of these oscillations is enhanced markedly for the mns embedded in the medium with a higher refractive index the effects of both the particle radius and the environ ment on the radiative plasmon resonance linewidth are illustrated by the example of au and na nanoparticles the contribution of the nonradiative plasmon decay is discussed as well our theoretical results should be important for the analysis of the experimental data on the optical and transport properties of mns embedded in various dielec tric media 1 t k sau a l rogach f ja ckel t a klar and j feld mann properties and
