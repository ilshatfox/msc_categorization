electrical conductivity and the halfwidth of the surface plasmon resonance are studied in detail for a spherical mn depending on the size of mn the efficiencies of light absorption and scattering with the temperature change are investigated it is found in particular that the absorption efficiency can both increase and decrease with a temperature drop the derived formulas make it possible to

with the frequency of collective electron oscillations in the mn the surface plasmon resonance spr is excited the frequency and the width of spr depends on the size morphology spatial orientation of mn and on the dielectric environment 1 2 resonance light scatterers are employed in various applications ranging from surface enhanced raman scattering 3 near field scanning optical microscopes 4 to bio chemical imaging 5 surface enhanced fluorescence 6 subwavelength optical waveguides 7 cancer therapy 8 etc the temperature effect on the optical and transport properties of the metal nanoparticles is very important for pure and applied science of nanoparticles 9 since a mn absorbs laser energy in a thin surface layer rapid local heating can occur at the surface thus for a detailed analysis of the laser light absorption or reflection at mn surfaces the properties of mns at electron temperatures must be stud ied the temperature dependence of the sp resonance is crucial due to a number of recent applications of noble mns in computer chips 10 thermally assisted magnetic recording 11 thermal cancer treat ment 12 catalysis and nanostructure growth 13 the use of nano objects as temperature sensors 14 and thermometers 15 is quite promising due to their small sizes and short thermal relaxation time previous calculations of the effect of the temperature on different properties of the mns were per formed in the zero temperature limit 16 17 or in the interval 15 1000 k only 9 18 30 while the optical properties of both the bulk metals 31 35 and the mns in the low temperature regime are now well studied the understanding of the effects of electron temperature typically of the order of 104 k on the plasmon modes has remained a challenge and is not so well understood as at the t 0 such an out of equilibrium situation can easily be induced in metallic nanoparticles 36 using ultrashort optical pulses at time t 0 only the electrons are excited by the laser pulse then the excited electrons would decay through light radiation phonon excitation and or electron electron scattering in the most com monly used approach the two temperature model 34 37 38 assumes that both electronic

conditions individually but each degree of freedom has its own temperature the energy exchange between the electrons and the lattice in this model leads to a time dependent electronic temperature te t the effect of electron temperature was not studied in detail so far because a broad temperature inter val requires the use of materials with high thermal stability in 22 25 30 an improved drudemodel was used where the electron concentration and or a plasma frequency are directly dependent on the electron temperature only a few works have addressed this problem so far 39 40 in this work we focus on optical properties of metal nanoparticles at relatively high electron tem peratures whereas the ion temperature ti is supposed to be much smaller 36 different behavior with temperature of optical lines for mns with different radii and shapes is a particular motivation for our present study the screening coming from the surrounding matrix is taken into account through a con stant dielectric function m to calculate the effect of the electron temperature on the optical and transport characteristics of mns we use the kinetic theory method which accounts for the electron scattering on the mn boundary it is shown that the efficiency of absorption with temperature strongly depends on the size of mn it is predicted that the effect of temperature on the mns with different radii can substantially modify their optical properties we present our theoretical results on the temperature dependence of the conductivity and polarizability tensors related to the mns having a spheroidal shape the rest of the paper is organized as follows the boltzmann equation approach to the problem is presented in section 2 section 3 contains the study of conductivity tensor in the spheroidal mns at finite temperatures in section 4 we consider the effect of temperature on the polarizability of mn section 5 is devoted to the study of light absorption and scattering crossection bymns the discussion of the obtained results is available in section 6 while section 7 contains the conclusions 2 boltzmann equation to account for the temperature effect on the conductivity and polarization properties of the mns we use the boltzmann equations approach the advantage of this approach is that the obtained results can be applied not only to mnswith a spherical shape but to strongly anisotropic spheroidal needle like or disk shaped mns thus it permits to study the effect of the particle shape on the physical values measured second the boltzmann equation method enables us to investigate the mns having sizes smaller than the electron mean free path l but in the case of sizes less than l it provides the same results as known from other approaches there exists a lower limit of applicability of boltzmann method in a small radius limit when the par ticle size is comparable to the de broglie wavelength of the electron and the quantization of the electron spectrum starts to play an essential role 41 practically it is around a radius greater or less than 2 nm let us consider a single ellipsoidal metal mnwith semiaxes a b c that is irradiated by an electromag netic em wave whose electric field is given as e e 0 exp i k r t 2 1 here e 0 is the amplitude of an electric field of a pump laser is its frequency k is the wave vector and r and t describe the spatial coordinates and time we restrict ourselves to the case of rayleigh scattering where the electromagnetic wavelength from a pump laser c is much larger than the diameter of the nanoparticle d max a b c then the electromagnetic field around the mn can be considered as homogeneous placing the coordinate origin in the center of the particle the above mentioned assumption is written as follows kr 1 2 2 the inequality 2 2 implies that the e field of the electromagnetic wave can be considered to be spatially uniform on scales of the order of a particle size such that all the conduction electrons move in phase producing only dipole type oscillations the amplitude of such a field is linked to e 0 by the relation 42 e j 0 0 e j in 1 l j m 1 2 3 33706 2 temperature dependence of plasmon resonances in spheroidal metal nanoparticles where is the dielectric permittivity of the mn m is the dielectric constant of the adjacent medium i e solvent and l j are depolarization factors in the j th direction in the principal axes of an ellipsoid the electric field ein gives rise to high frequency current inside the mn to obtain the average density of this current over the mn it is necessary first of all to calculate the electron velocity distribution func tion the field ein has an effect on the equilibrium electron velocity distribution and thus determines the appearance of a nonequilibrium addition f 1 r v t to the fermi distribution function f 0 1 exp kbt 1 here is the chemical potential kb is boltzmann s constant m 2 2 denotes the kinetic energy of an electron v refers to the electron velocity and m is the electron mass as is well known 43 44 the equilibrium function f 0 does not give any input to the current accounting for both the time dependence of equation 2 1 and the inequality 2 2 the total distribution function of electrons can be represented as follows f r v t f 0 f 1 r v t f 0 f 1 r v ei t 2 4 we seek the function f 1 r v as a solution to the linearized boltzmann s equation i f 1 r v v f 1 r v r eeinv f 0 0 2 5 where e is the electron charge in equation 2 5 we have assumed that the collision integral f 1 t col f 1 is evaluated in the relaxation time approximation 1 refers to electron collision frequency strictly speaking t is a temperature dependent value which can be presented as follows t nee 2 m k t 5 t 0 z 5 ez ez 1 2 dz 2 6 where ne is the electron concentration is the debye temperature and k combines together the factors depending on the details of the fermi surface geometry and scattering matrix elements for simplicity we also assume that the vortex electric field induced by magnetic component of the external em field gives a comparatively small input at the plasmon resonance frequencies and can be neglected in equation 2 5 what is more the function f 1 r v ought to satisfy the boundary conditions as well these conditions may be chosen from the character of electron reflection from the inner walls of the mn we adopt as is usually done the assumption of diffusive electron scattering by the boundary of mn then the boundary conditions can be presented in the form f r v s 0 vn 0 2 7 where vn is the velocity of the component normal to the particle surface along with diffusive scattering the mirror boundary conditions at the nanoparticle surface were examined in the literature for electron scattering see e g 43 44 in this case each electron is reflected from the surface at the same angle at which it falls to the surface in diffuse reflection the electron is reflected from the surface at any angle for the mirror mechanism to be dominant the surface must be perfectly smooth in the atomic scale because the degree of reflectivity of the boundary essentially depends on its smoothness practically for a nonplanar border such smoothness is extremely difficult to achieve as was shown 45 the mirror boundary conditions give a small correction to the results obtained with the account of only the diffusive electron reflections therefore we choose more realistic boundary conditions given by equation 2 7 the boundary conditions 2 7 in the case of an ellipsoidal mn broadly speaking depend on the an gles which complicates the solution of equation 2 5 33706 3 n i grigorchuk it is rather easy to solve 2 5 and to satisfy the boundary conditions of 2 7 if one passes to a trans formed coordinate system where an ellipsoid with semiaxes a b c along the x y and z directions respectively transforms into a sphere of radius r with the same volume x j d j r x j r abc 1 3 2 8 with j 1 2 3 and d 1 a d 2 b d 3 c a similar transformation should be made for the electron velocities j d j r j 2 9 equation 2 5 and the boundary conditions 2 7 in transformed coordinate and velocity systems can be rewritten as follows i f 1 r v v f 1 r v r eeinv f 0 0 2 10 f r v r r 0 r v 0 2 11 the first condition calls for zero equality of the electron distribution function at the nanoparticle surface and the second one r v 0 means that an electron motion occurs only inside mn and there is no electron leakage through the np surface equation 2 10 presents the partial differential equation with boundary conditions 2 11 using the method of characteristics one can obtain the solution to this equation in the form f 1 r v t e f 0 v ein 1 exp i tc r v i 2 12 where the characteristic tc r v can be presented as follows tc r v 1 v 2 r v r 2 r 2 v 2 r v 2 2 13 the radius vector r determines the starting position of an electron at the moment tc 0 the characteris tic curve of equation 2 13 depends only on the absolute value of r and does not depend on the direction of r it is reasonable to point out that in spite of the electric field which remains spatially uniform in side the mn the distribution function 2 12 still depends on the coordinates due to the requirement to obey the boundary conditions 2 11 owing to this dependence other physical parameters averaged with f 1 r v start to depend on coordinates too since the physical sensing involves only parameters averaged over the whole mn volume v it is necessary to fulfill the integration over all the coordinates inside the mn one can see this exemplified just below using the solution 2 12 one can calculate the density of a high frequency current induced by the em wave inside the mn performing the fourier transformation of equation 2 12 we obtain j 2 e v m 2 3 v d 3 r d 3 v f 1 r v 2 14 3 electric conductivity tensor let us introduce the tensor of electric conductivity using the relationship j 3 1 e in 3 1 then in accordance with both equations 2 12 and 2 14 the components of this tensor can be pre sented as follows 2 e v m 2 3 v d 3 r d 3 e f 0 1 e i tc r i 3 2 33706 4 temperature dependence of plasmon resonances in spheroidal metal nanoparticles electric conductivity tensor is the symmetrical second rank tensor since the integrand in equation 3 2 is an odd function for nondiagonal tensor components and the integration is con ducted over the whole velocity space only diagonal components in this equation have been retained if we introduce a rectangular coordinate system and choose the fundamental directions x y z to be coincident with the three principal axes of the ellipsoids then we get xx 0 0 0 y y 0 0 0 zz the tensor of electric conductivity as can be seen from equation 3 2 is a complex value i 3 3 the surface effect on the conducting phenomenon is described in equation 3 2 by means of a char acteristic tc r v it accounts for the restrictions imposed on the electron movement by nanoparticle surfaces as one can see from equation 2 12 the value of tc is of the order of t r f where f is the fermi velocity this implies that the value reciprocal to tc will correspond to the vibration frequency between the particle walls hence the inequality tc 1 indicates that the electron collision frequency inside the mn bulk would significantly exceed the one for an electron collision with the surface of mn if this inequality is satisfied one can direct tc then the exponent in equation 3 2 vanishes and finally we arrive at a standard expression for an electric conductivity 1 42 1 4 2 pl i 3 4 with 2 pl 4 e 2 m 2 3 f 3 3 3 5 to be sure of that it is necessary to take into account that the energy derivative of f 0 in the zero approximation in the small ratio of kbt f f is the fermi energy can be replaced by f 0 f 3 6 and passes in equation 3 2 to the integration over in the spherical coordinate system d 3 2 0 d 0 sin d 0 2 d with the use of the formula 0 4 2 2 f d 3 f 2 3 7 we denote with and the azimuthal and polar angles with respect to the ellipsoid rotation axis z re spectively note here that only diagonal terms with are retained after integration over all angles as one can see from equation 3 4 the conductivity becomes a scalar quantity in this approxima tion in the general case of an ellipsoidal shaped mn the electric conductivity is the tensor quantity 3 2 integrating it over all nanoparticle coordinates in a solid angle d sin d d gives 1 v v d 3 r 1 e i t r 3 4 3 8 where we use 33706 5 n i grigorchuk 0 dz z 3 erfc z a z 1 4 a 3 4 e 4 a 3 9 provided that re a 0 and 0 dz z 3 erfc z a z 1 2 a 2 a 3 8 3 10 the complex function entering the equation 3 8 has the form 4 q 2 1 1 q e q 3 11 with 4 3 2 q 4 q 3 q q 2 r i 3 12 and is a deformed electron velocity 17 with the coefficient of deformation j r d j the last summand in equation 3 11 represents the oscillation part of the function and the first one refers to its smooth part accounting for equation 3 8 and only diagonal components in equation 3 2 there remain the inte grals over all electron velocities to calculate them we pass to a spherical coordinate system with the z axis directed along the rotation axis of the spheroid as we have done it above then equation 3 2 can be rewritten as follows j j 3 e 2 m 3 2 2 3 1 i 2 0 d 0 sin d 0 2 d 2 j f 0 3 13 where j is the j th component of the electron velocity j x y z with 2 x y 2 sin 2 cos 2 sin 2 2 z 2 cos 2 respectively it should be noted that the deformed electron velocity entering the function can be expressed through the electron velocity in a cartesian coordinate system as follows r cos 2 a 2 sin 2 b 2 sin 2 cos 2 c 2 3 14 let us suppose that the particle in the matrix is modelled as a rotationally symmetric ellipsoid a b r c r with the symmetry axis along the z direction the components of an electron velocity parallel and perpendicular to the spheroid revolution axis z cos 2 x 2 y sin 3 15 play an important role in this case and the ceases to depend on the angle let us pass from an integration in equation 3 13 over electron velocities to the integration over electron energies 4 d 1 m 2 m 3 2 d 3 16 and take into account the integrals 2 0 cos 2 d 2 0 sin 2 d 3 17 33706 6 temperature dependence of plasmon resonances in spheroidal metal nanoparticles then with the use of equations 3 13 3 16 and 3 17 we obtain for the main components of the com plex electric conductivity tensor namely for xx y y zz 3 18 the expression 3 e 2 2 2 p 2 m 3 1 i 2 0 cos sin 2 1 2 cos 3 d 0 f 0 3 2 d 3 19 we denote with 2 the angle between the direction of an electron velocity and an axis perpen dicular to the spheroid rotation axes here and below the upper lower symbol in the parentheses on the left hand side of equation 3 19 corresponds to the upper lower expression in the parentheses on the right hand side of this equation the function in 3 19 depends now on both the energy and the angle because the parameter q see 3 12 and 3 14 for a spheroidal particle becomes dependent on the angle and can be determined as q 2 m i sin 2 r 2 cos 2 r 2 1 2 q 3 20 where r and r are the semiaxes of the spheroid the electron energy entering the function be comes dependent on the angle too and for a spheroid can be presented as follows r 2 cos 2 r 2 sin 2 r 2 3 21 where the equation 3 14 was used since the spheroid semiaxes r and r can be easily expressed through the radius of a sphere r of an equivalent volume r r r r 1 3 r r r r 2 3 3 22 the energy does not depend on the particle radius r but depends only on the spheroid axes ratio if we restrict ourselves here to the case of low temperatures then the equation 3 6 can be used and we find 0 f 3 2 d 3 20 3 23 where 0 is the chemical potential at zero temperature substituting 3 23 into equation 3 19 and ac counting that the electron concentration at t 0 can be presented as n 0 2 m 0 3 2 3 2 3 3 24 it is easy to check that equation 3 19 transforms to the form known from see e g 46 3 1 conductivity of a spherical mn for particles having a spherical shape the electric conductivity becomes a scalar quantity and one can put r r r in equations 3 20 and 3 16 then q and the function cease to dependent on the angle 2 0 cos sin 2 1 2 cos 3 d 1 3 3 25 33706 7 n i grigorchuk and equation 3 19 reduces to the form sph e 2 p 2 m 2 2 3 i 0 f 0 3 2 d 3 26 let us make the following change of variables in equation 3 26 kbt d d kbt 3 27 then f 0 d e 1 e 2 d 3 28 and the integral in 3 26 can be presented as kbt kbt 3 2 e 1 e 2 d i 3 29 where 4 3 2 m kt r i 2 m kt 3 2 2 r 3 i 3 2 m kt r 2 i 2 1 2 m kt 2 r i exp 2 r i 2 m kt 3 30 with 47 t 0 1 2 12 kbt 0 2 3 31 since the input of the integrand tends to zero as the lower limit in this integral can be extended to the the derivative f 0 has a maximum at the point so it is conveniently to expand the product of kbt 3 2 in the powers of 3 2 0 3 2 kbt p 0 3 2 0 1 8 p 3 kbt 2 0 12 kbt 0 4 2 0 2 0 3 3 32 with 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 3 33 note that 0 at f coincides with the defined by equation 3 11 then the integral 3 29 can be presented as the sum of integrals i 3 2 0 i 1 3 2 kbt p 0 3 2 0 i 2 1 2 3 kbt 2 4 p 0 3 kbt p 0 3 2 0 i 3 3 34 where the integrals i j d j 1 exp 1 exp 2 are calculated to be i 1 1 i 2 0 and i 3 2 6 33706 8 temperature dependence of plasmon resonances in spheroidal metal nanoparticles using i j and 3 27 equation 3 26 transforms into sph

equation 3 35 we obtain sph t me 2 r 2 3 q 0 t t 3 39 with t 2 6 kbt 2 3 40 t t 1 8 q 24 q 2 1 1 q e q 3 41 t 1 4 q 24 q 3 3 42 when the temperature t 0 in equation 3 40 then 3 39 is reduced to the form sph e 2 3 20 p 2 m 2 2 3 0 i 3 43 known from other calculations see e g 48 the conductivity of mn given by 3 39 is a complex value practically we need to know both the real and the imaginary parts of it further analytical calculations are possible for some particular cases in the case of a spherical mn there are three actual frequencies that are usually considered the frequency of an incident electromag netic field the collision frequency of electrons in the particle volume and the vibration frequency between the particle walls s f 2 r provided the particle size is less than the electron mean free path when s the mechanism of an electron scattering in the bulk dominates and an electron scat tering from the particle surface gives only small corrections of the order of s however a much more interesting case is when the mechanism of the surface electron scattering dominates which corresponds to the inequality s let us suppose that the mean free path of a conduction electron l is much greater than the particle size in this case an electron scattering occurs mainly from the inner surface of the mn the electrons oscillate between the walls of the particle with the frequency s in the case of s to a first approxi mation one can formally put 0 if one introduces the designation qi s 3 44 then for real and imaginary parts of the ratios i and t i we obtain re i 0 1 2

resonance is controlled by lifetime broadening due to various decay processes knowing the expressions for conductivity tensor 3 19 and 3 49 the halfwidth of the plasmon line absorption can be calculated simply by means of a relation j t 4 n 2 1 l j 1 re j j t 3 53 where n p m is the refractive index of the surrounding medium and 1 inter is the high fre quency dielectric constant due to interband and core transitions of the inner electrons in amn s material the figure of merit fom can be expressed through the j j as well for mns having a spheroidal shape we found 48 fom n pl 1 l 1 4

the real and imaginary parts of a dielectric constant tensor j j can be easily obtained with the help of tensor j j as 47 j j t 4 j j t 3 56 j j t 4 j j t 3 57 the sign in the last equation and before the second term in equation 3 56 corresponds to the exponent sign in time dependence of an external electric field e t e 0 e i t the imaginary part of the dielectric constant provides basically the damping and broadening of spr the linewidth of spr and fom are strongly dependent on the particle radius we will illustrate this dependence below having built the temperature behavior of spr linewidth for different r as an example the spr linewidth is plotted in figure 1 against temperature for spherical au nanoparticles with two different radii embedded in the water n 1 33 calculations weremade

equation 3 51 with n 0 given above by equation 3 24 for au n 0 5 9 1022 cm 3 the behavior of t is governed by the temperature dependence of the t in accordance with equations 3 53 and 3 57 figure 1 color online spr linewidth vs temperature for spherical au particles with different r 50 1 and 54 7 2 embedded in water high temperature of an electron gas can be achieved inside the mn by using laser pumping at spr frequency when hot electrons are produced as the temperature of an electron gas decreases after an initial excitation the spr linewidth can increase see curve 1 figure 1 or decrease curve 2 depending on the particle radius such different behavior is due to the linewidth oscillations with the particle radius changing 48 earlier 30 33 the results for ag and au nanoparticles were reported where the linewidth is only reduced linearly with the temperature lowering over a range of crystal temperatures let us calculate the polarizability tensor for mns at finite temperatures 4 polarizability tensor the dipole electric moment for a spherical particle embedded in the media with dielectric constant m can be written as follows d j m 3 k 1 j k ek 4 1 where ek is the k component of an external electric field and j k is the polarizability tensor of the mn the calculation of d is especially simple for the case when the particle sizes are small compared to some 33706 11 n i grigorchuk wavelength c p which corresponds to the frequency in the particle bulk in this case one can calculate the polarizability of mn using the formulae obtained for an external uniform statical field in general terms this tensor can be treated as being a complex value j k j k i j k 4 2 tensor of electric conductivity was introduced by equation 3 1 the component of the inner elec tric field in equation 3 1 is linked to the component of an external electric filed in equation 4 1 by expression 2 3 since the density of electric current is related to the dipole moment by a simple relation j t 1 v t d t 4 3 it is easy to establish the connection between polarizability and conductivity of mn performing the fourier transformation of equation 4 3 we obtain j i v d 4 4 then using equations 4

where tensor j j corresponds to a given frequency and in the case of frequencies close to the plasma oscillations of electrons in metal it can be presented as follows j j t pl 2 4 i j j t 4 7 optical absorption generally measures the im t 5 light absorption and scattering in classical electrodynamics it is supposed that the light scattering results from the polarization of the scattered particle when it is illuminated with a beam of light since the spatially uniform field causes only a dipole polarization the nanoparticle scatters the light like a vibration dipole 1 in the case of particles of a spheroidal shape the dipole moment of the mn can be presented in the form 51 d me m me m 5 1 where m is the unit vector directed along the spheroid axis of revolution accounting for m e e cos where is the angle between the spheroid axis of revolution and the direction of the electric field e the equation 5 1 can be rewritten as follows d 2 sin 2 2 cos 2 me 5 2 using our forerunning formulae for d and it is easy to calculate the temperature dependence of light absorption and scattering the overall absorption and scattering cross sections for a spheroidal mn 33706 12 temperature

cross sections are observed at the frequency which corresponds to the plasmon resonance of a spherical nanoparticle in the vacuum formulae 5 15 and 5 14 yield a resonance when t 2 m the absorption and the scattering cross sections defined by equations 5 3 and 5 4 reach the maximal values at the frequencies of the sprs as well near the surface plasmon resonance light may interact with the particle at low temperatures over a cross sectional area usually larger than the geometric cross section of the particle because the polarizability of the particle becomes very high in this frequency range we calculate the scattering efficiency of the mn which is defined as the ratio sef c cgeom cgeom c pl 2 5 16 where cgeom is the geometrical cross section of an individual particle and c is defined by equations 5 3 and 5 4 or by 5 14 and 5 15 figure 2 color online the absorption crossection vs temperature for spherical au particles with differ ent r 78 1 100 2 125 3 and 150 4 embedded in water figure 2 shows the variation of an absorption efficiency as a function of temperature for gold nanoparticles having a spherical shape embedded in water n 1 33 the calculations were performed in accordance with equations 5 16 and 5 14 with the use of the same parameters as above for figure 1 for zero temperature we get the classical result 1 2 when the spr intensity depends on the parti cle radius larger particles have a larger scattering or absorption cross sections the situation drastically changes at finite electron temperatures as we can see from figure 2 the absorption efficiency not only in creases right hand sides of curves 1 4 with the temperature drop but can also decrease left hand sides of curves 1 4 we have an interesting situation when the absorption crossection with the temperature lowering increases at first reaches its peak then decreases and starts to increase again these observa tions are explained by the conductivity of mn which oscillate with the particle radius changing 46 in the case of light scattering see figure 3 the effect of mn size is more pronounced because the scattering cross section is proportional to the square of the particle volume in figure 3 one can see that the efficiency of light scattering at a resonance frequency does not only increase curves 1 3 with the growth of the mn radius but can also decrease curve 4 the latter means that the efficiency of scattering at a resonance frequency can be suppressed with the temperature rise for some particle radii depending on the electron temperature the scattering efficiency reaches the maxi mum value whose peak position depends on the nanoparticle radius the peak positions of the resonance plasmon absorption or scattering by au nanoparticle embed ded in water can be shifted toward shorter wavelengths as the temperature of electron gas is lowered 33706 14 temperature dependence of plasmon resonances in spheroidal metal nanoparticles figure 3 color online the same as in figure 2 but for scattering crossection after an initial excitation this behavior is consistent with the known temperature dependent shift of the differential transmission peak in an isolated sodium nanoparticle 26 6 discussion of results here we shortly discuss the effects caused by deviations from the spherical particle shape when the symmetry of the particle decreases the number of resonance peaks increases if the shape of a particle deviates from the spherical one the 3 fold degeneracy dipole mode splits into two for spheroid or three for ellipsoid modes giving rise to corresponding scattering peaks in this case the plasmon response strongly depends on the particle position relative to the illumination direction to evaluate the electron temperature effect on the absorption or scattering crossections for various illumination directions one can perform numerical calculations using equations 5 3 5 9 and 3 19 the particle absorption or scattering effects depend on the size and shape of individual particles metallic particles that are much smaller than the wavelength of light tend to absorb still more and hence the absorption dominates the scattered light intensity from small mns is extremely low indeed rayleigh scattering theory predicts that the scattering cross section of a spherical cluster should drop as the sixth power of the diameter the quantity that is measured experimentally is frequency resolved time dependent transmis sion 26 on after the excitation of the mn by a pump laser pulse then the static equilibrium trans mission off of the sample measured in the absence of the pump is subtracted to obtain the relative differential transmission 19 on off off in the thermal equilibrium the can be related to the temperature dependent absorption cross section by 37 3 2 r 2 cabs t cabs t 0 6 1 where t 0 is the temperature of the mn before excitation this relation holds for very small sizes of mn when the reflectivity of the mn is very small a direct comparison of theoretical results with most of the available experimental measurements of the optical properties of mns is still a matter of debate because inhomogeneities in nanoparticle size shape and local environment hide the homogeneous width of the surface plasmon resonance 33706 15 n i grigorchuk 7 conclusions we have applied a kinetic theory to the calculation of the optical properties of a metal nanoparti cle embedded in a dielectric media at different temperatures it permits to determine the cross section of light absorption or scattering for various polarizations of the incident electromagnetic wave the ob tained analytical formulas provide the evaluation of the dynamics of light absorption or scattering inten sities at the plasmon frequencies for nanoparticles with different radii and shapes when the temperature of electron gas becomes settled after the action of a laser pulse the analytical expressions for electroconductivity and polarizability tensors have been obtained for the case of mns with a spherical shape they permit to calculate a number of other physical quantities e g resonance linewidth figure of merit etc for a particular temperature we theoretically studied the variation of both the linewidth of spr and the efficiency of the light absorption and scattering bymnwith the change of the electron temperature the case where the frequency of a laser beam is close to surface plasmon frequencies of a spheroidal mn is studied in detail the high sensitivity of the temperature dependence of spr linewidth to the radius of a particle was es tablished even a small variation in the particle radius can drastically change the run of the spr linewidth curve vs temperature this is due to the linewidth oscillations when the radius of mn is varied the ef ficiencies of light absorption and scattering for various temperatures strongly depend on the particle radius as well the au nanoparticles with different radii are used for illustration
