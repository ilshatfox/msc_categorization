acceleration of magnetic dipoles by the sequence of current turns 1 acceleration of magnetic dipoles by the sequence of current turns s n dolya joint institute for nuclear research joliot curie str 6 dubna russia 141980 abstract acceleration of magnetic dipoles is carried out by the running gradient of the magnetic field formed while sequent switching on the current turns magnetic dipoles with a diameter of dsh 60 mm and full length ltot 1 m are pre accelerated by using the gas dynamic method to speed vin 1 km s corresponding to the injection rate into the main accelerator to prevent the turning of the dipoles by 180 degrees in the field of the accelerating pulse and focus them the magnetic dipoles are accelerated inside the titanium tube the magnetic dipoles have mass m 2 kg and acquire the finite speed vfin 5 km s on the acceleration length lacc 300 m introduction there is a known 1 method to accelerate the magnetic dipoles by the current pulse moving in the space using a large number of turns in principle allows one to reach a high finite speed of the magnetic dipoles when the electric current is flowing in the coils there is the magnetic field which pulls the magnetic dipole inside the coil with the current after the magnetic dipole passing through the center of the coil the magnetic field gradient changes its sign due to this the magnetic dipole begins to accelerate in the opposite direction i e inhibits therefore to create a continuous acceleration the current in the loop must quickly break off after the magnetic dipole passing through the coil center however despite the apparent simplicity of this method its practical use is accompanied with serious difficulties from the ferromagnetic materials being used for magnetic dipoles the most suitable is iron having a high specific magnetic moment and high curie temperature the specific magnetic moment is the property of the substance and cannot be increased furthermore since the magnetic dipole must include a jet engine with the fuel supply and navigation devices the specific magnetic dipole moment will be even less than that of the pure iron that is why it is not possible to achieve a large finite speed of the magnetic dipole by using the acceleration method 2 we explain the details the magnetic moment per molecule in iron 2 page 524 is of the nb 2 219 bohr magneton the table value of the bohr magneton power 2 page 31 mb 9 27 10 21 erg gs taking into account that the atomic weight of iron is afe 56 we find that the magnetic moment per nucleon in iron is mfe 2 10 10 ev gs nucleon and this value mfe cannot be increased another principle disadvantage of this device is that the movement of the magnetic dipoles therein is unstable in the longitudinal direction the reason is that at the attraction of the magnet poles with opposite signs there is phase instability 3 thus if the magnetic dipole is slightly behind the running current pulse accelerating it then it will turn out to be in a lower momentum field and finally will be forever behind it if the magnetic dipole becomes too close to the current pulse it will fall into a stronger field being more and more attracted to the current pulse at the end finally it will be ahead of it and turn by 180 degrees from the point of view of mutual positioning of the accelerating running pulse and the magnetic dipole there is the only stable case when the pulse pushes not pulls the magnetic dipole this means that the region of the phase longitudinal stability is located on the front slope of the traveling pulse in the accelerator technology it is called the principle of phase stability 3 the specific magnetic dipole moment can be probably increased as compared with iron by applying a current of the superconducting layer located inside the dipole the magnetic field gradient which accelerates the dipole can be increased by superconductivity the both ways lead to increasing the force accelerating the dipole fz m dbz dz where m specific magnetic dipole moment dbz dz the magnetic field gradient we assume that the initial speed of the dipole is vsh 1 km s and it is achieved by the gas dynamic acceleration 1 opportunity of increasing the specific magnetic moment in the magnetic dipole the specific magnetic dipole moment can be increased as compared with iron if to place the nb 3 sn superconducting winding inside the dipole and let the ring current flow through it 3 let us calculate how much the specific magnetic moment the magnetic moment per unit of the mass of the magnetic dipole will grow if to put a layer of superconducting nb 3 sn with radius rcyl 3 cm and thickness cyl 0 2 cm in its cylindrical part with a length equal to lcy 1 40 cm we assume the current density in the superconductor to be equal 2 page 312 to jss 3 10 5 a cm 2 then linear density jss current a cm in such a superconducting layer is equal to jss a cm jsp cyl 6 10 4 a cm such linear current density on the surface of the superconductor will create the magnetic field strength equal to hss kgs 1 226 j a cm 70 kgs that does not contradict the opportunity of achieving the current density of jss 3 10 5 a cm 2 2 page 312 the total current flowing in the superconducting layer is equal to isc jss lcyl 2 4 10 6 a it will lead to the appearance of magnetic moment mss isc rcyl 2 6 8 107 a cm 2 or in the cgs system mss 6 8 10 6 erg gs the total mass of the superconducting layer can be calculated from the following the density of nb 3 sn superconductor is nb 3 sn 8 g cm 3 the atomic mass a 400 and the total volume of superconductor vsp 150 cm 3 contains nnb 3 sn 7 2 10 26 nucleons the specific magnetic moment the magnetic moment per unit of the mass nucleon is then equal to mss mss nnb 3 sn 0 94 10 20 erg gs nucleon 5 9 10 9 ev gs nucleon that is approximately 30 times greater than in iron 2 page 524 2 ways to achieve the required parameters of acceleration let the mass of the superconductor in the magnetic dipole be mnb 3 sn 1 2 kg the mass of the jet engine fuel navigation control devices is equal mfuel 0 8 kg then the specific magnetic moment in the magnetic dipole will be equal to m 0 3 5 10 9 ev gs nucleon that is approximately 17 times greater than in iron the pulse duration of the magnetic field can be determined from the following considerations to place the magnetic dipole on the length of the pulse accelerating it slowdown wavelength must be of the order of slow 4 m the time period t 0 of the corresponding wave is determined from the following relationship slow vsh t 0 1 where we find that t 0 4 ms and the wave frequency corresponding to this period is equal to f 0 250 hz 4 3 selecting the thickness of the barrel wall of the gauss gun the region of the phase stability in azimuthally symmetric wave corresponds to the region of the radial instability the magnetic dipole will push itself from the pole of the same sign but first of all it will seek to turn around by 1800 and be attracted by the opposite sign poles to prevent the radial escape of the dipole and its reversal by 1800 in the field of the pulse accelerating is possible if to place the dipole inside the titanium tube whose inner diameter is the same as the outer diameter of the dipole the titanium tube wall thickness must be of such value to let the external magnetic field freely without distortion penetrate inside it means that it should be much smaller than the skin layer depth in titanium electrical resistance of copper cu 1 67 10 6 ohm cm titanium ti 55 10 6 ohm cm 2 page 305 the conductivity dimension is 1 s are related with a specific resistance value 9 1011 for copper the conductivity is cu 5 4 10 17 1 s for titanium ti 3 23 10 16 1 s this allows one to calculate the depth of the skin layer and thereby to calculate the possible thickness of the tube wall where the magnetic dipole will be accelerated let us find the thickness of the skin layer for titanium for frequency f 0 250 hz it can be calculated by the following formula ti c 2 f 0 ti 1 2 1 68 cm 2 this means that the wall thickness of the titanium tube hti wherein the magnetic dipole has to be accelerated can be chosen to be equal to hti 2 mm 4 interaction of the dipole with the magnetic field gradient for stable acceleration of magnetic dipoles it is necessary to switch on consequently the magnetic coils according to the dipole move the magnetic field of the coil with a current can be written as follows bz i 0 r 0 2 2 r 0 2 z 2 3 2 3 where i 0 current in the loop ampere r 0 the radius of the coil with a current cm z the distance from the coil plane to the observation point 5 in comparison of the multi section gauss gun 1 the corresponding coil here is necessary to be switched on after the magnetic dipole passage through the coil center but not to join the coil switched on in advance 4 1 acceleration of the magnetic dipole by the current single coil we differentiate expression 3 with respect to z and obtain a formula for the magnetic field gradient dbz dz 3 2 r 0 2 i 0 z r 0 2 z 2 5 2 4 from this formula it is clear that the gradient field is zero in the coil plane at z 0 we assume that at a distance of the order of the radius of the turn the speed of the dipole varies slightly i e it is possible to change variable z for vsht the specific magnetic dipole moment increases while the dipole passing through the center of the coil according to the law m 2 m 0 z lsh 5 where m 0 3 5 10 9 ev gs nucleon lsh length of the dipole the current in the coil after switching increases linearly with time according to the law i i 0 4 t t 0 6 where t 0 time period of the slowdown wavelength the force influencing the dipole from the coil side is fz m 0 z lsh 3 2 r 0 2 z i 0 4 t t 0 r 0 2 z 2 5 2 7 substituting t for z vsh and integrating over z we obtain an expression for the energy gain rate while passing one loop by the magnetic dipole w fzdz m 0 z lsh 3 2 r 0 2 z i 0 4 z vsht 0 r 0 2 z 2 5 2

the same order should be the turn radius r 0 1 m after the magnetic dipole passing a distance lsh 2 its magnetic moment does not any longer increase and the dipole magnet will be just repelled by a coil with a current the corresponding set of energy can then be written as follows r 0 w 2 6 m 0 r 0 2 i 0 vsht 0 z 2 r 0 2 z 2 5 2 dz 10 lsh 2 substituting numerical values of r 0 1 m lsh 1 m calculating the integrals and summing w 1 and w 2 we find that the energy acquired during the passage of one current loop by the magnetic dipole is equal to w 12 m 0 r 0 2 lsh i 0 vsht 0 5 5 10 2 11 4 2 acceleration of the magnetic dipole by consequence of current turns we assume that the consequence of current turns is as follows per 1 m there are 103 turns 103 m the current in each coil is assumed to be equal to i 0 150 ka assuming m 0 3 5 10 9 ev gs nucleon and averaging the action of the turns on the magnetic dipole with a coefficient of we finally obtain the formula for the energy gain rate of the magnetic dipole w 4 33 10 4 ev nucleon m 12 multiplying w 4 33 10 4 ev nucleon m by the length of the acceleration lacc 300 m we find the finite energy of the magnetic dipoles wfin 0

diaphragm 6 pumping conclusion while increasing the diameter of the magnetic dipole its total magnetic moment grows as the area of its turn i e proportionally as r 2 the dipole mass at a constant current density increases as the perimeter of the loop i e linearly with the radius thus the specific magnetic dipole moment will grow linearly with increasing of the turn radius literature 1 http ru
