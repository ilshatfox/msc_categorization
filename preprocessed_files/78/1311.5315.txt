dubna 141980 russia abstract a possibility of electrodynamic acceleration of particles from the initial zero velocity to the final velocity vfin 10 km s over the acceleration length lacc 5 m is considered after the electrostatic preacceleration to vin 1 km s particles are accelerated at the trailing edge of the voltage pulse u pulse 5 75 mv which runs along the spiral turns accelerated particles have the mass m 6 10 6 g diameter dsh 6 and length lsh 1 cm because of a pointed cone at the head the particles can move in the air almost without loss of velocity penetrating into aluminum and water as deep as l al 10 cm and l water 1 m respectively introduction it is known 1 that magnetic dipoles can be accelerated by orienting them in space so that the magnetization axis coincides with the acceleration axis and applying the current pulse field being a difference interaction the dipole interaction is inherently much less effective than the monopole charge interaction for example if one of the poles of the dipole is repelled by the accelerating pulse the other is at the time is attracted to the current pulse and the resulting accelerating force is the difference of these two forces therefore a uniform magnetic field does not act on the dipoles the dipoles can be accelerated by the magnetic field gradient in addition iron which is the most suitable material for acceleration has a low specific magnetic moment magnetic moment per nucleon m 2 10 10 ev gs nucleon accordingly the energy gain rate of the iron magnetic dipole m b z in a gradient magnetic field with a reasonable gradient b z 500 gs cm is found to be wmag m b z 2 10 10 500 10 7 ev cm energy gain by a particle having a specific charge the charge per nucleon in units of electron charge can amount to e z a 10 8 and in the electric field e 10 kv cm the energy gain rate is found to be wel 10 8 104 10 4 ev cm which is three orders of magnitude higher than the energy gain rate in the dipole interaction 2 the spherical shape of the particles used in some systems is not optimal for many reasons especially acceleration related ones as the radius of particle increases the acceleration efficiency dramatically drops to understand better the fundamental shortcomings of acceleration of spherical particles let us compare the main parameters of accelerated iron balls with different diameter table 1 the main parameters of the accelerated objects d a z z a e mev m g i 2 2 1013 6 107 3 10 6 0 1 3 2 10 11 4 10 5 20 2 1016 6 109 3 10 7 1 3 2 10 8 1 2 10 5 200 2 1019 6 1011 3 10 8 10 3 2 10 5 4 10 6 2 103 2 1022 6 1013 3 10 9 102 3 2 10 2 1 2 10 6 in all cases the electric field on the surface of the object is esurf 10 9 v cm the first column is the diameter of the ball in m the second column is the atomic weight of the ball in units of the atomic mass of the nucleon the third column is the limiting charge z on the object in units of the electron charge the fourth column is the ratio of the charge on the ball to its weight the fifth column is the potential of the object the energy that an electron must have to overcome the repulsion of the electrons previously placed on the object the sixth column is the mass of the ball in grams and the seventh column is the initial velocity of the balls acquired by them after the acceleration in the electrostatic field with the voltage uinj 250 kv expressed in units of the speed of light in v c where c 3 10 5 km s is the velocity of light in vacuum a comparison of the data presented in table 1 shows that as the diameter of the balls increases their weight and atomic mass column 6 increase as the cube of the radius and the charge to be placed on the ball to get the field strength esurf 10 9 v cm increases as the square of the radius for a ball with the diameter d 2 mm the charge in units of electron charge q i 2 a 5 s 6 1013 is already close to the limiting charge per pulse accelerated in linear accelerators the ratio of the charge placed on the ball to the mass of the ball column 4 linearly decreases with increasing diameter which means that the acceleration efficiency linearly with increasing diameter i e balls of a larger diameter will gain less velocity over the same accelerator length and at the same intensity 3 for cylinder shaped particle the parameter z a does not depend on the length of the cylinder at all because the charge placed on the particle and its mass linearly increase with increasing length of the cylinder platinum coating and oxygen passivation of the particle greatly increases its surface barrier preventing electrons from leaking from with particles the cylindrical shape of particles with a pointed cone at the head allows much better ballistic performance than that of the prototype namely the pointed cone ensures a very low drag coefficient which is important for moving through the atmosphere without losing velocity the use of tungsten instead of iron significantly improves the aerodynamic quality of particles finally elongated cylindrical particles will be able to penetrate into a material many time deeper than spherical particles which is of interest for some practical applications accelerator 1 introduction of 3 3 of iron in tungsten let us add 3 3 of iron to a tungsten particle and magnetize this macroparticle so that the axis of magnetization coincides with the longitudinal axis of the cylinder and the axis of acceleration since the atomic weight of tungsten is about 3 3 times greater than that of iron and tungsten does not has intrinsic magnetic moment the resulting specific magnetic moment will be approximately 100 times lower than that of iron m 1 2 10 12 ev gs nucleon 2 platinum coating and oxygen passivation of the tungsten wire to create a surface barrier for electrons accommodated on the particle the work function of the electrons must be increased as much as possible best known is the work function of platinum passivated with oxygen 2 the charge located on the macroparticle will leak from it through field emission according to the formula 2 j e 2 e 2 8 h exp 8 3 2 m 1 2 h e 3 2 ee y 1 where y is the nordheim function in which the argument is a relative reduction in the work function of an external electric field in the sense of 4 schottky 3 spatial orientation and pre acceleration of particles we estimate the velocity of particles accelerated by a coil in which the current is turned off when the macroparticle reaches the middle of the coil the field strength on the axis of the coil is described by the formula bz 2 i c r 0 2 z 2 r 0 2 3 2 2 where r 0 is the radius of the current coil turn i is the current in the turn and z is the distance from the center of the turn let the particle be pre magnetized and have a specific magnetic moment two orders of magnitude lower than that of iron namely m 1 2 10 12 ev gs nucleon using formula 2 we find the magnetic field gradient bz z bz 3 z z 2 r 0 2 and the particle energy increment resulting from the interaction of the particle magnetic moment with the magnetic field gradient of the current turn win 1 m 1 bz z lacc 3 which for lacc 10 cm and the magnetic field gradient bz z 500 gs cm can be estimated at win 1 10 8 ev nucleon so that the velocity of the particles after pre acceleration in this turn coil gun will be vin 1 1 5 m s and the segment will be directed along the axis of acceleration 4 electron beam irradiation of particles electron energy thus we have slightly accelerated the macroparticle due to its weak magnetization and which is important oriented it along the axis of acceleration further acceleration of the particle will be due to its interaction with the electric field therefore it must be an electrically charged macroparticle the charge can be produced by irradiating the macroparticle with an electron beam the surface strength of the field is takes to be esurf 40 mv cm later we will analyze in detail the choice of this very important parameter then for the wire diameter d 6 we find that the minimum energy of the electrons capable of overcoming the coulomb repulsion of the electrons previously placed on the 5 macroparticle should be we eesurf dsh 2 12 kev 5 electron beam irradiation of particles mean free path the path of electrons with an energy of 12 kev in aluminum is approximately 2 mg cm 2 2 given the density of aluminum al 2 7 g cm 3 we find that the extrapolated path of electrons in aluminum is lal 7 since the tungsten density is tung 19 35 g cm 3 more than 7 times higher than the density of aluminum the mean free path of electrons with an energy of 12 kev in tungsten is approximately 1 thus electrons with the energy we 12 kev are not able to cross the particle diameter 6 will lose their energy by ionization of matter and will stop deep in the particle 6 electron beam irradiation of particles irradiating beam density we estimate the time of flight of the macroparticle over a distance equal to its own length that is lsh 1 cm at the particle velocity vsh 1 5 m s this time will be tsh lsh vsh 7 ms let the duration of the electron beam irradiation be tirr 300 s below we will show that during this time the macroparticle fully charged electrons will lose less than one percent of electrons through field emission let the total number of electrons placed on the particle be ne 4 10 10 let the transverse dimensions of the irradiating beam ribbon be sirr 5 1 cm where the beam cross section 5 is chosen such that the length of the chord drawn through the cross section of the particle is greater than 1 the depth of the extrapolated path of the electrons with the energy we 12 kev in tungsten considering that the reflectance of slow electrons from tungsten is about kirr 0 35 2 we find from the relation jirr 6 10 18 sirr tirr kirr ne 4 that the desired current density of the electron beam irradiation is approximately jirr 0 1 a cm 2 which is much lower than for example the electron emission current density obtained from oxide cathodes 6 7 electron beam irradiation of particles introduced pulse we estimate the transverse particle velocity arising from the pulse introduced by electrons the velocity of the electrons irradiating the particle is e ve c 5 10 3 where c 3 1010 is the speed of light in vacuum the transverse velocity of the particles resulting from electron irradiation will be v ne aana meve mn 5 where ne is the number of uncompensated planted on macroparticle electrons na is the number of atoms in the particle aa is the atomic weight of tungsten me is the electron mass and mn is the mass of the nucleon if there are few excess electrons in the macroparticle ne aana z a 1 23 10 8 and the electron to nucleon mass ratio is 1 2000 the transverse velocity is low if it is a problem particles will have to be irradiated with the two colliding electron beams 8 electron beam irradiation of particles field electron emission to plant several charges on a macroparticle is not a problem but when there are many electrons on the macroparticle they will begin to leak from it through field emission let the field strength for field emission be e 4 107 v cm after this field strength is attained all the newly planted electrons will leak from the particles due to the coulomb repulsion once there is quite a lot of electrons planted on the particle it becomes necessary to overcome their repulsion for planting more electrons this means that the energy of electrons that we want to plant on the particle should be high enough to allow them to overcome this coulomb barrier reach the particle and stay on it for spherical particles the coulomb barrier linearly increases with increasing radius and for particles with the diameter d 2 mm it can be as high as tens of mev which will require a special accelerator for the electrons to overcome it field emission will be an obstacle for planting a high electric charge on the particle part of the charge will continuously leak from particles due to the tunnel effect the dependence of the field emission current density on the electric field strength for surfaces with different work functions is given in 2 7 we take the following parameters density tung 19 g cm 3 particle diameter dsh 6 length lsh 1 cm particle cross section str d 2 4 2 8 10 7 cm 2 volume vsh 2 8 10 7 cm 3 the mass of the tungsten wire segment particle msh 6 10 6 g lateral particle surface ssurf dsh lsh 10 3 cm 2 and surface tension of the field on the macroparticle esurf 4 10 7 v cm let us find the charge on the particle that is enough to create the electric field esurf 4 10 7 v cm from the expression relating the strength of the field on a cylinder to the linear charge density on it esurf 2 r 4 10 7 2 ene 300 r 6 thus ne 4 x 10 10 9 acceleration of particles by the electrostatic field let us now calculate the resulting ratio z a the proportion for tungsten is 6 1023 nucleons 184 g ntung nucleons 19 35 g 7 we find from it that in one cubic centimeter of tungsten there are ntung nucleons 1 16 10 25 nucleons in the wire segment with the diameter dsh 6 and length lsh 1 cm there are 3 25 10 18 nucleons and the ratio z a for this segment is z a 4 1010 3 25 1018 1 23 10 8 8 let the accelerating electrostatic field be eacc 10 kv cm the equation of motion of particles with a specific per nucleon charge z a 1 23 10 8 can be written as dv dt z a eeacc mn 9 where mn is the mass of the nucleon assuming that the initial particle velocity is zero we obtain an expression for the time dependence of the dimensionless velocity v c where c 3 105 km s is the speed of light in vacuum in the form 8 z a eeacc mnc 2 ct 10 let the final acceleration velocity be vfin 1 km s which corresponds to the dimensionless velocity fin 3 3 10 6 from equation 10 we can find that ct 2 7 107 therefore the time of acceleration from the initial zero velocity to the final velocity vfin 1 km sis tacc 9 10 4 s the acceleration length lacc 1 can be found from the formula of uniformly accelerated motion which in our case can be written as lacc 1 z a eeacc mnc 2 ctacc 2 2 11 substituting numbers into 11 we find that the acceleration length is lacc 1 45 cm accordingly the electrostatic voltage required for the acceleration of particles is uacc uacc eacc lacc 1 450 kv 12 10 leakage of electrons let us find the number of electrons that left the particle during the acceleration given the field strength e 40 mv cm and the work function e 6 5 ev we find from the graph 2 that the leakage current density is j 10 4 a cm 2 the charge leakage q will be q j ssurf tacc 13 where j 10 4 a cm 2 is the leakage current ssurf 1 88 10 3 cm 2 is the lateral surface area of the particle and tacc 9 10 4 s is the acceleration time substituting numbers into 13 we obtain q 109 electrons which is about 2 5 of the number of electrons planted on the particle gold coated tungsten wire 5 to 500 m in diameter has been produced for decades by the swedish company luma 3 9 11 electrodynamic acceleration a charged tungsten wire segment can be accelerated from the initial velocity vin 1 km s to the final velocity vfin 10 km s in a spiral waveguide with a voltage pulse running in its turns the final velocity fin 3 3 10 5 corresponds to the energy w fin mc 2 2 fin 2 0 54 ev nucleon at the accelerating rate e 0 sin s 100 kv cm this energy can be obtained over the length lacc wfin z a e 0 sin s 4 5 m taking the synchronous phase s 60 0 sin s 0 87 we find that the amplitude of the electric field strength in a spiral waveguide must be e 0 115 kv cm it is not necessary to use a sine wave for accelerating a wire segment instead we can use a single sine pulse equal to the half cycle wave in time and half length of the wave propagating in the spiral waveguide 4 the relationship between flux and the electric field strength for a spiral with the space between the spiral and the screen filled with a dielectric is given by the formula 4 p c 8 r 0 2 e 0 2 14 where c 3 x 1010 cm s is the speed of light in vacuum r 0 50 cm is the initial radius of the spiral e 0 115 kv cm is the field strength on the axis of the spiral is the phase velocity and 1280 is the dielectric constant of the filling between the spiral and the screen the value of the brackets for the argument x 1 is approximately 4 the argument of the modified bessel functions of the first and second kind x 1 2 r 0 0 where is the phase velocity and 0 c f 0 is the vacuum wavelength is optimal 4 in our case at the beginning of acceleration r 0 50 cm 3 3 10 6 f 0 160 hz and t 0 2 3 12 ms substituting numbers into 14 we obtain p w c 8 2 5 103 1 15 2 1010 3 3 10 6 1 28 103 4 9 104 107 2 32 gw 15 the length of the slowed down wave at the beginning of the acceleration 10 is slow 0 3 14 m and the spatial length of the accelerating pulse is equal to half the wavelength lpulse 1 57 m the base duration of the pulse is t 0 2 3 12 ms the amplitude of the pulse can be evaluated from the relation upulse e 0 slow 2 5 75 mv 16 from the relation x 1 2 r 0 0 it follwos that for each phase velocity of the wave propagating in the spiral waveguide there is its own optimum spiral radius optimum wavelength frequency and pulse duration as it is quite difficult to cover an order of magnitude change in of the phase velocity from vin 1 km s to vfin 10 km s with one pulse duration value it is reasonable to divide the spiral waveguide into sectionsin which a pulse of optimum duration propagates 4 since this pulse defocuses the accelerated particle there should be focusing elements placed between the sections in our case electrostatic quadrupole lenses are most suitable 4 12 release of particles into the atmosphere particles must be irradiated with an electron beam and then accelerated in a rather high vacuum p 1 10 9 mm hg while they are expected to be used under normal atmospheric conditions p 2 10 3 mm hg which gives the pressure difference of about 12 orders of magnitude this pressure gradient can be produced using several buffer cavities for example cylindrical chambers separated by end walls with pulse diaphragms built into them each cavity must be individually evacuated let us calculate the number of the air particles that penetrate the first cavity nearest to the atmosphere let the radius of the diaphragm be r 0 d 1 cm and the time for which it remains open be t 1 10 4 s then the linear velocity of the iris diaphragm petals will be v 11 r 0 d t 1 10 4 cm s which should not be a problem for the operation of the mechanism the average velocity of the thermal motion of air molecules v can be assumed to be equal to the speed of sound in the air v 3 104 cm s of all possible spatial orientations of the velocity only 1 6 1 6 is one face of the cube is directed towards the diaphragm the number of molecules in a cubic centimeter of the air under normal conditions the loschmidt number of is 0 l 2 7 10 19 molecules cm 3 then the number of molecules coming from the atmosphere to the first buffer cavity while the diaphragm is open is 11 n 0 1 6 0 l r 0 d 2 vt 1 17 substituting numerical values into 14 we find that the total number of particles coming from the atmosphere to the first buffer cavity is n 0 4 10 19 let the volume of the first cavity be v 01 10 l 10 4 cm 3 then the density of molecules in it after the diaphragm operated will be n 0 4 10 15 molecules cm 3 particle density and pressure p nkt in the first buffer cavity is about 4 orders of magnitude lower than the density of particles in the atmosphere under normal conditions thus at least three cavities are needed to produce the appropriate pressure gradient we now consider the dynamics of the particle density in the cavity for the time between the operations of the device let the cavity be pumped through the hole with an area s 1 10 3 cm 2 we assume that all molecules within this area are removed from the volume and that the time between the shots is t 2 10 2 s i e the operation frequency of the device is f 100 hz the equation describing the particle density reduction during the pumping can be written as dn n 1 6 s 1 vt v 01 18 the solution of this equation can be written as n n 0 exp 1 6 s 1 vt v 01 19 for the pumping time t t 2 the exponent is approximately 5 and thus the pumping reduces the density of molecules in the first buffer cavity by a factor of more than 100 then n n 0 7 10 3 and the density of particles in the first buffer volume before the next shot will be n 1 4 10 15 7 10 3 3 x 1013 molecules cm 3 i e 6 orders of magnitude lower than the loschmidt number 0 l 2 7 10 19 molecules cm 3 it is evident that before the next shot the cavity can be considered

sections 7 doublets of quadrupole electrostatic lenses 8 pulse diaphragms 9 individual evacuation of buffer cavities application 1 ballistics let us calculate the motion of the particle accelerated by the electrostatic fieldwith air resistance taken into account the equation of motion of the particle can be written without allowance for the gravitational attraction to the earth mdv dt cxstrv 2 2 20 where m is the mass of the particle v is the velocity 0 e z h 0 is the barometric formula for the atmospheric density change with altitude 0 1 3 10 3 g cm 3 is the air density at the surface of the earth h 0 7 km is the altitude at which the density drops by a factor e in our case the particle is a cylinder str is the cross section of the particle str d 2 4 2 8 10 7 cm 2 and cx is the aerodynamic coefficient 13 the aerodynamic coefficient or the drag coefficient is a dimensionless quantity that takes into account the quality of the particle form cx fx 0 v 0 2 str 21 equation 20 can be written as v t v 0 1 cx v 0 str t 2 m 22 to calculate the particle velocity variation in time it is necessary to find the aerodynamic coefficient cx 2 calculation of the particle drag coefficient in the air we assume that the particle has the shape of a cylindrical rod with a conical head when a nitrogen molecule hits the cone the change in the longitudinal velocity of the molecules is vx vx h 2 2 23 where h is the cone angle the momentum transferred by the gas molecules to the macroparticle is p mv vxstrt vx 24 the change in the momentum per unit time is a force namely a drag force fx 1 vxstr vx h 2 25 dividing fx 1 by v 2 xstr we obtain the drag coefficient for a pointed cone at the mirror reflection of molecules from the cone the newton formula cx air h 2 26 let the length of the conical part of the particles be lcone 3 mm this means that the cone angle is h 2 10 3 and cx air 4 10 6 14 3 passage of particles through the atmosphere let us calculate the passage of the particle with a drag coefficient cx air 4 10 6 through the earth s atmosphere the decrease inthe velocity with time due to air resistance is described by 20 we choose the following parameters 0 e z h 0 where h 0 7 km cx air 4 10 6 str 3 10 7 cm 2 vfin 10 6 cm s m 6 10 6 g and 0 1 3 10 3 g cm 3 for the first few seconds of flight the decrease in the velocity is very small further as the altitude increases the contribution of this term will decrease exponentially thus for the altitude z 2 km the factor ez h 0 is 0 75 for z 4 km it is 0 57 etc this means that the velocity loss of the particle during its ascent and descent can be neglected and it can be considered as flying in vacuum 4 particle penetration depth in aluminum the depth to which a tungsten wire segment moving at a velocity of v 0 10 km s penetrates in aluminum can be estimated in the following way since the processes in question are fast it is necessary to consider only interaction with the atoms that are on the way of the wire segment let us find the energy to be spent for heating one centimeter of aluminum with the cross sectional area equal to the cross section of the tungsten wire str 2 8 10 7 cm 2 from room temperature to the melting point then we should add the solid liquid phase transition energy to this energy the fluid should be heated to the evaporation temperature and the liquid vapor phase transition energy should be taken into account the total expenditure of energy is w 1 cm 10 2 j cm the kinetic energy of the tungsten wire segment with a diameter of dsh 6 length lsh 1 cm and velocity v 0 10 km sis wsh 0 3 j the analysis of collisions of meteorites with solids allows the conclusion that at these velocities about 40 of the kinetic energy of meteorites is spent for heating and evaporation of the target material we assume that out of the entire kinetic energy of the tungsten wire segment wsh 0 3 j the energy spent for evaporation of aluminum is wsh 1 0 1 j 15 now dividing wsh 1 by the specific energy loss w 1 cm we find the depth of penetration of the segment in aluminum l al wsh 1 w 1 cm 10 cm 5 drag affected penetration depth of particles in water let us find the drag force acting on the particle moving in water unlike the case in the air reflection of molecules from the particle in water should be considered as being diffuse which leads to the drag coefficient cx w 1 the time dependence of the veclocity reduction will be described by 23 we denote the particle stopping velocity in water by vs let vs be 0 1 km s from 23 we obtain the particle slowing down length t 0 ls v t dt 2 m w cx w str ln 1 v 0 vs 27 0 where v 0 is the velocity at which the particle enters water w 1 g cm 3 is the density of water cx w 1 m is the mass of the particle and vs 0 1 km s thus the particle slowing down length in water is ls 1 2 m w cx w str ln 1 v 0 vs 28 the coefficient of the factor ln v 0 vs 1 has the dimension of length and is 40 cm for the parameters chosen above in our case v 0 vs 10 2 and relation 28 yields the drag affected particle penetration depth in water ls 1 180 cm contributions to particle slowing down in water will also come from the other processes e g viscosity of water 6 penetration depth of particles in water as affected by water viscosity the equation of motion of the particle entering water can be written as mdvx dt fx 2 29 the drag force due to viscosity is fx 2 s dv dr 2 rsh lsh v 2 rsl 30 where 10 2 poise is water viscosity rsh 3 10 4 cm is the radius of the particle lsh 1 cm is the particle length dv dr is the radial gradient of the 16 longitudinal water velocity near the particle and is the characteristic length of the velocity variation in radius equation 29 with the viscosity drag force in the form of 30 can be rearranged in the form dv v m 2 rsh lsh dt 31 which has the solution v v 0 exp m 2 rshlsh t 32 now we can find the path traveled by the macroparticle to a stop in water lwater vdt v 0 m 2 rsh lsh 33 0 to find the particle penetration depth in water we need to find the characteristic length of the ramp near the water velocity variation in radius near the particle let us find it from the navier equation vx t vx vx x r d dr rdvx dr 2 vx x 2 34 first we will see in which case the term vx vx x is much greater than 2 vx x 2 let x lch be the characteristic length over which the velocity varies then vx vx x vx 2 lch 2 vx x 2 vx lch 2 the condition vx vx x 2 vx x 2 is satisfied if vxlch re 1 where re is the reynolds number and the relation re 1 is certainly satisfied in our case now we rearrange 34 in the form vx t vx vx x dvx dt r d dr rdvx dr 35 where we replaced t vx x the partial derivative with respect to time and coordinate by d dt the total time derivative 17 substituting dvx dt m 2 rshlsh dvx dr found from 33 into the navier equation we obtain the equation m 2 rsh lsh dvx dr r d dr rdvx dr 36 which after cancellation of the water viscosity and transpositions takes the form 2 rshlsh m rdvx dr d dr rdvx dr 37 replacing rdvx dr by y we get d lny 2 rsh sh m dt 38 or dvx dr c 1 v r exp 2 rsh lsh r m 39 to find the integration constant c 1 v we integrate 39 again and obtain v c 1 v ei 2 rsh lsh r m c 2 v 40 where ei z exp t dt t expint z is the exponential integral here we 0 made a replacement 2 rsh lsh r m t the limits of integration with respect to r are from r rsh to infinity and the lower limit of integration with respect to t is accordingly t 2 r 2 sh lsh m 2 water tungsten 0 1 the function ei z cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions it can be approximated as 5 e zln 1 2 z ei z e zln 1 1 z z 0 41 equation 40 describes the radial dependence of the velocity of the medium as the particle moves in it at a velocity v at large distances from the particle v 0 and thus c 2 v 0 the boundary condition on the surface of a body is usually taken to be the condition of sticking of the medium particles to the body i e when r rsh the velocity of the medium is v v 0 from which we can find the constant c 1 v 18 v 0 c 1 v ei 0 1 and c 1 v v 0 ei 0 1 42 expression 32 for the velocity gradient at the surface of particles can now be written as dvx dr v 0 rsh ei 0 1 exp 0 1 43 thus the characteristic amount of the radial velocity variation is rsh ei 0 1 exp 0 1 44 and according to formula 33 the particle path length particles in water is lwater vdt v 0 m 2 rsh lsh v 0 m ei 0 1 exp 0 1 2 l 45 0 finally lwater v 0 m 2 lsh ei 0 1 exp 0 1 46 substituting v 0 10 km s m 6 10 6 g 10 2 poise lsh 1 cm and ei 0 1 2 6 exp 0 1 1 1 into 46 we obtain lwater 230 cm 47 to find the penetration depth in water as affected by two processes viscous drag and friction we should be add the inverse values and find the penetration depth lwater by the formula lwater ls 1 lwater ls 1 lwater 1 m 48 thus the penetration depth of the tungsten wire segment in water is approximately lwater 1 m conclusion even a weakly magnetized particle will rotate in the magnetic field of the earth like an ordinary compass needle if the particle turns relative to the velocity vector all aerodynamics and penetration depth formulas will be 19 incorrect which means that we must look for other ways to orient macroparticles relative to the axis of acceleration if we apply four sectors of a material with different resonant absorption frequencies to the macroparticle the particle motion can be controlled by evaporation of the material from the corresponding sector and transverse ablative acceleration of the particle considering that the velocity of the evaporated material is vab 0 1 km s and the mass of the evaporated material is mab 0 1 m 0 1 of the wire segment mass we find that in this way we can get angles of deviation from the original direction on the order of 10 3 references 1
