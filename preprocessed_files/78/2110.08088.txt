materials have important applications in many fields here we joined a silver nanostructure film agnsf and a carbon nanotube film cntf by van der waals force to form a agnsf cntf heterojunction which shows excellent photothermal and photoelectric conversion properties the local temperature difference t and the output photovoltage increase rapidly when the heterojunction is irradiated by lasers with wavelengths ranging from ultraviolet to terahertz the maximum of the t reaches 205 9 k which is significantly higher than that of other photothermoelectric materials reported in literatures the photothermal and photoelectric responsivity depend on the wavelength of lasers which are 175 601 k w 1 and 9 35 40 4 mv w 1 respectively we demonstrate that light absorption of the carbon nanotube is enhanced by local surface plasmons and the output photovoltage is dominated by seebeck effect the agnsf cntf heterostructure can be used as high efficiency sensitive photothermal materials or as ultra wideband fast response photoelectric material mailto jqwei tsinghua edu cn mailto jlsun tsinghua edu cn 2 in recent years with the rapid development of economy the greenhouse gases emitted by burning fossil fuels have led to a rise of the global temperature 1 therefore it is urgently required for development of clean and renewable energy conversion technologies 2 it has been attracted much attention on using the photothermoelectric effect to realize light heat electricity energy conversion the photothermoelectric effect refers to the temperature difference t formed at different locations of the device after absorption of photon energy which is then converted into an output voltage through the seebeck effect 3 in the photothermoelectric effect the output voltage is related to the t and the seebeck coefficient of the material the magnitude of the t is determined by the light absorption and heat capacity of materials while the seebeck coefficient is determined by the density of states near the fermi energy level 4 some photothermoelectric materials and devices with good performance have been prepared for example when a laser with a wavelength of 906 nm and a power of 70 mw was used to irradiate the interface between monolayer graphene and a gold electrode using a cr sio 2 cr polyethylene terephthalate pet as the substrate the temperature of the device increased by 37 k 5 however when the substrate was directly irradiated by a laser with a wavelength of 906 nm and a power of 70 mw the temperature of the cr sio 2 cr pet increased from 26 7 to 190 7 c i e t 164 k 5 when a three dimensional porous graphene was irradiated by a terahertz laser wavelength of 118 8 m with a power density of 19 mw mm 2 its temperature increased by 109 3 k 6 in addition some photothermal materials show promise in solar energy harvesting 7 making microcontrollers 8 and cancer treatment 9 for example ti 2 o 3 nanoparticles can be used as excellent materials for solar energy collection and seawater desalination when exposed to 1 kw m 2 simulated sunlight the temperature of ti 2 o 3 increases by 25 k after about 200 s 10 single walled carbon nanotube cnt with poly 3 hexylthiophene dispersed in pdms sheets p 3 ht swnt pdms are also excellent photothermal conversion materials and their temperature can be increased by 45 k after 180 s when irradiated by a laser with a wavelength of 785 nm at 80 mw mm 2 11 it has shown that photons can excite the strong surface plasmons on the surface of noble metal nanomaterials which can effectively enhance absorption of photons and improve the light heat electricity energy conversion efficiency of photothermoelectric materials 12 17 we also found that it can produce strong surface plasmons on silver nanostructure when they are irradiated by a laser 12 13 which behave good surface raman enhancement effect 15 16 or negative photoconductance effect 12 13 cnts have an ultra wideband absorption spectrum 18 25 high charge carrier mobility 26 and good light absorption 27 previously we used a suspended cnt film cntf as a photodetector 28 which showed ultra wideband response from ultraviolet to terahertz wavelengths and a high light responsivity of 25 4 ma w 1 at 1064 nm and a power of 24 mw based on the above factors we joined a ag nanostructure film agnsf and a cntf to fabricate a agnsf cntf heterostructure on a glass substrate by van der waals force and then investigated its photothermoelectric conversion and response performance the sample showed amazing photothermal conversion ability and good photoelectric response characteristics when a laser irradiate the agnsf cntf heterojunction the temperature at the center of the heterojunction and the output photovoltage of the device increased rapidly in the ultra wideband range from ultraviolet to terahertz wavelengths and the photothermal and photoelectric response time was on an order of tens of milliseconds the experimental data showed that the agnsf cntf heterostructure can be used as a material for making fast response ultra wideband photodetectors and it also can be used as a material for producing high efficiency sensitive solar collectors or photothermal materials results local large t on the agnsf cntf heterojunction sample 3 figure 1 local large t a heat map obtained when the heterojunction of the sample was irradiated by

camera see supplementary information 1 during laser irradiation in real time the temperature of the heterojunction increase clearly when it is irradiated by lasers with different wavelengths for example a representative heat map is shown in figure 1 a when the agnsf cntf heterojunction was irradiated by a laser with a wavelength of 1064 nm and a power of 518 mw within the first few tens of milliseconds of laser irradiation the local temperature increases sharply to 512 15 k forming a large t of 205 9 k with the adjacent area of the spot the spot diameter of 2 0 mm which is intuitively shown by a three dimensional heat map in the insect of figure 1 a the t of 205 9 k is significantly higher than the maximum t achieved by photothermoelectric or photothermal conversion materials reported in literatures see supplementary table 1 the melting point of silver nanowires is 848 k 29 and the cntf was tested under atmospheric conditions which can maintain unchanged at high temperature of 873 k therefore if we continued to increase the power of the laser irradiating the sample the temperature at the heterojunction would have a large space to increase the corresponding relationship between the photograph lower inset and the infrared photograph of the actual sample is shown in figure 1 b when the center temperature of the heterojunction reaches 512 15 k we simultaneously record the temperature of both the agnsf and cntf sides by an infrared camera the upper inset in figure 1 b shows the temperature position curve similar temperature position curves were obtained when lasers with other wavelengths were used to irradiate the heterojunction as shown in figure 1 c rapid photothermal response of the agnsf cntf heterojunction to further study the response speed and stability of the photothermal conversion of the agnsf cntf heterojunction we derived the temperature time curves at the heterojunction with and without laser irradiation from the thermal distribution video see supplementary information 1 recorded with an infrared camera 4 figure 2 photothermal response curves of the center temperature of the heterojunction with time when the heterojunction was irradiated by lasers with wavelengths of a 375 nm 405 nm 532 nm 633 nm 1064 nm and b 118 8 m respectively from the temperature time curves in figure 2 the center temperature of the agnsf cntf heterojunction showed an obvious rapid response process when it was irradiated by lasers with different wavelengths from ultraviolet to terahertz here we define a photothermal responsivity rt as the ratio of the final temperature increase at the center of the heterojunction to the absorbed light power after laser irradiation on the heterojunction t pp t r in t 1 where t is the change in temperature pin is the incident optical power measured by a power meter in front of the sample and pt is the transmitted optical power measured by a power meter behind the sample for the response time the rise time refers to the time taken to increase from the minimum value to 80 of the maximum value t while the fall time is the time taken for t to decrease from the maximum value to 20 of the maximum value 30 the performance parameters of photothermal conversion of the agnsf cntf heterojunction irradiated by lasers with different wavelengths are given in supplementary table 2 the photothermal responsivity was in the range 175 601 k w 1 and the response time was tens of milliseconds except for irradiation by a laser with wavelength of 118 8 m ultra wideband photoelectric response of the agnsf cntf heterojunction figure 3 a is the set up used to measure current voltage i v curves of the sample figure 3 b shows the i v curve when the heterojunction is irradiated by a

coordinate system for the heterojunction irradiated by lasers with wavelengths ranging from 375 nm to 118 8 m the photocurrent is defined as i ilight idark where ilight is the current measured with laser illumination and idark is the current measured at dark without laser illumination 5 figure 3 photoelectric performance a schematic diagram of the device used to measure the i v curves of the sample b i v curve when the heterojunction irradiated by a laser with wavelength of 1064 nm c i v curves of the heterojunction irradiated by lasers with wavelengths ranging from 375 nm to 118 8 m

curve obtained when different positions of the sample were irradiated by a laser with wavelength of 532 nm and power of 236 mw in which the position 0 mm is the central position of the heterojunction the i v curves of the sample were linear figure 3 b which indicates that the agnsf and cntf is in ohmic 6 contact with a resistance of 30 in the first quadrant that is when the bias voltage is positive the current of the sample irradiated by the laser was higher than the case without illumination in the third quadrant that is when the bias voltage was negative the absolute value of current decreases after illuminating the heterojunction the direction of the photovoltage generated inside the sample is from the agnsf side to the cntf side after the laser illumination in the i v curves the absolute value of the intersection point of the red curve and the horizontal axis is the photovoltage generated by laser irradiation on the heterojunction the vertical coordinate of the intersection point of the red curve and the vertical axis is the photocurrent generated by laser irradiation of the heterojunction from figure 3 c photocurrent i generates in the sample when it is irradiated by lasers with various wavelengths in addition the photocurrent i almost independent on the applied bias by fixing the wavelength and power of laser illumination the photovoltage time response curves measured by the oscilloscope are shown in figure 3 d e we calculate the photoelectric responsivity rv of the sample by t pp u r in v 2 where pin is the incident optical power pt is the transmitted optical power and u is the output photovoltage value of the sample for the response time the rise time refers to the time taken for the photovoltage to increase from the minimum to 80 of the maximum value while the fall time refers to the time taken for the photovoltage to decrease from the maximum value to 20 of the maximum value 30 the equivalent noise power nep which is also known as the minimum metering power can be expressed as v b r trk nep 4 3 where kb is the boltzmann constant t is temperature in this case room temperature and r is the channel resistance of the device the specific detectivity d which is also called the detection sensitivity is calculated by the following equation nep s d 0 4 where s 0 is the area of the light spot on the heterojunction from the curves in figure 3 d e the agnsf cntf heterojunction shows a significant photoelectric response from ultraviolet to terahertz wavelengths the device has an output photovoltage of 11 6 mv when the agnsf cntf heterojunction was irradiated by a laser with wavelength of 1064 nm and a power of 518 mw the calculated results of the key performance parameters for photoelectric conversion of the agnsf cntf are given in supplementary table 3 the photoelectric responsivity rv ranges from 9 35 40 4 mv w 1 and the response time is in tens of milliseconds except for the case with irradiation by a laser with wavelength of 10 6 m and 118 8 m the maximum photoelectric responsivity reaches 40 4 mv w 1 for the case irradiated by a laser with wavelength of 405 nm and power of 163 2 mw when the sample is irradiated by a laser with wavelength of 118 8 m the response time reaches an order of seconds which might derive from the strong absorption of photons at low energy and poor thermal conductivity of the glass substrate the equivalent noise power of the device was on the order of 10 8 w hz 0 5 and the detectivity was on the order of 105 jones a laser with wavelength of 532 nm and power of 236 mw is used to successively irradiate different positions of the sample the curve of the change in photovoltage with the position is shown in figure 3 f the maximum photovoltage is generated when the laser irradiated the center of the heterojunction while the photovoltage rapidly decreased when the laser irradiated both sides of the heterojunction in addition when the light spot irradiated the agnsf side the 7 photovoltage decreased slightly faster with the position than when the light spot irradiated the cntf side and the photovoltage finally decreases to nearly 0 mv discussion we compare the photothermal conversion ability of the agnsf agnsf cntf heterojunction and cntf a laser with incident light power of 149 mw wavelength of 532 nm and spot diameter of 1 2 mm is used to irradiate the agnsf region 1 agnsf cntf heterojunction region 2 and cntf region 3 in figure 4 a the temperature time response curves are shown in figure 4 b figure 4 agnsf test point 1 agnsf cntf heterojunction

163 0 69 9 0 1 44 4 57 4 when the test points were irradiated by a 532 nm laser the temperatures of the agnsf agnsf cntf heterojunction and cntf increased by 0 5 85 4 and 48 6 k respectively figure 4 b the similar test is also performed with 405 633 and 1064 nm lasers the temperature time response curves are shown in supplementary figure 1 table 1 provides the corresponding comparison results according to the data in table 1 the photothermal conversion ability of the agnsf cnt heterostructure is significantly enhanced compared with that of the pure cntf in general the rise temperature of the agnsf cntf heterojunction was more than 50 higher than that of the pure cntf while the surface temperature of the agnsf did not significantly increase when irradiated by the laser our explanation for this phenomenon is as follows as shown in supplementary figure 3 a the agnsf is mainly composed of pure silver nanoparticles and nanowires with diameters of 40 100 nm when a laser irradiates the agnsf it produces plasmons that propagate along the surface of the silver nanowires 17 ag is a good heat conductor so it will not produce an obvious local 8 high temperature region on the surface of the agnsf however when the laser irradiates the agnsf cntf heterojunction it can produce localized surface plasmons in the interface of the agnsf and cntf on the one hand the local surface plasmons can effectively promote absorption of photons by the cntf 31 on the other hand the coupling between the plasmons and the silver nanoparticles can form nanoscale hot spots which can increase the intensity of the laser local field irradiated on the heterojunction by more than four orders of magnitude in a very small area 32 therefore the cntf absorb more photons in the local micro nano size region when the agnsf is spread underneath and the local temperature also increases rapidly and significantly from the temperature position curves in figure 1 b and figure 1 c when a laser irradiates the heterojunction of the sample the temperature of the heterojunction is significantly higher than those of the agnsf and cntf at the contact ends with the electrodes the cntf consists of metallic and semiconducting nanotubes 33 in which there are two types of charge carriers electrons and holes the temperature of the heterojunction after laser irradiation was significantly higher than the temperatures at the far ends of the agnsf and cntf figure 1 for the cntf see figure 3 a the holes in the cnts at the heterojunction have higher energy and spread to the area with lower temperature as the holes spread to the cold end of the cntf more and more holes accumulate at the cold end however there are more negative charges at the heterojunction and the built in electric field formed prevents the holes from moving to the cold end when the internal electric field force received by the holes and the driving force provided by the t reach a balance the internal electric field formed in the cntf points from the cntf to the heterojunction according to previous reports 34 electrons flow from the cnts to the metal when a laser irradiates a heterojunction composed of cnts and a metal therefore while the holes move from the heterojunction to the cold end of the cntf the electrons move from the cntf to the agnsf a more visual way to study the photothermoelectric effect is to compare the photovoltage time and temperature time response curves obtained at the same step in the same coordinate system if they show the same trend and the response time is on the same order of magnitude the photoelectric response behavior of the sample is mainly caused by the seebeck effect bao s group used this method to show one period when ag srtio 3 heterostructure is irradiated by the laser with a wavelength of 10 57 m 37 to make a detailed comparison between the photovoltage time and temperature time response curves we set the switching period of the optical shutter to 1 2 20 and 100 s and then irradiated the heterojunction with a laser with wavelength of 532 nm and power of 149 mw the response curves of the photovoltage and temperature with time were synchronously recorded all of the temperatures in the temperature time curves were then subtracted from the initial temperature of the sample to obtain the t time curves the photovoltage time and t time curves plotted in the same coordinate system for visual comparison are shown in figure 5 figure 5 intuitively and clearly indicates that the photovoltage time and t time curves show the same dynamic response law and basically the same response time and numerical variation trend further confirming that the output photovoltage of the sample is mainly generated by the seebeck effect 9 figure 5 a d photovoltage time and t time curves on the same time axis when the heterojunction of the sample was irradiated by a laser with wavelength of 532 nm and power of 149 mw and the cycle of the optical shutter switching was set to 1 2 20 and 100 s respectively the u laser power and corresponding t laser power curves in the same coordinate system for laser wavelengths of 405 532 633 and 1064 nm are shown in figure 6 where u is the increment of the photovoltage t is the temperature difference between the heterojunction and far end of the cntf and the laser power refers to the absorption power of the sample from figure 6 when lasers with the same wavelength but different laser power irradiated the agnsf cntf heterojunction the u and t values at the heterojunction approximately linearly increased with increasing absorbed laser power indicating that the device has stable photoelectric response and photothermal conversion performance with different laser power 10 figure 6 a d u laser power and t laser power curves measured when the agnsf cntf heterojunction was irradiated by lasers with wavelengths of 405 532 633 and 1064 nm respectively figure 7 thermal and optical properties of cntf a the u across the sample versus the corresponding t to determine the seebeck coefficient s of cntf babsorption spectrum of cntf as shown in figure 7 a the data points here are derived from figures 2 and 6 we obtain seebeck coefficient s of the cntf by fitting the data points which is s 56 6 v k 1 according to a literature review the seebeck coefficient of the agnsf is approximately sagnsf 1 v k 1 35 36 which can be ignored here from figure 7 a except for the laser 11 with wavelength of 375 nm the data point indicated by a black arrow when the heterojunction was irradiated by the lasers with the other wavelengths the experimental data points are all on the straight fitting line or distributed on both sides of the straight fitting line very closely our explanation is as follows as shown in figure 7 b the absorption peak of cntf appears at 270 nm when the wavelength of incident light increases the absorption rate decreases as the wavelength of incident light approaches 270 nm the interband transition of electrons corresponding to the photoelectric effect in cntf enhances significantly therefore when the heterojunction is irradiated by the laser with the wavelength of 375 nm the proportion of photoelectric effect in the contributed photovoltage increases obviously the above results indicated that the photovoltage generated by laser irradiation of the agnsf cntf heterojunction in the wavelength range from visible to terahertz is mainly contributed by the photothermoelectric effect in conclusion the agnsf cntf van der waals heterojunction showed excellent photothermal conversion performance when the heterojunction of the device was irradiated by different lasers with ultrawide band range from ultraviolet to terahertz wavelengths the temperature increased obviously and rapidly the photothermal responsivity was in the range 175 601 k w 1 and the response time was on the order of tens of milliseconds local surface plasmons can enhance light absorption of the cnt material when the pure cntf and agnsf cntf heterostructure were irradiated with 405 532 633 and 1064 nm lasers the variation of the increase of the temperature of the agnsf cntf increased by 57 4 80 4 compared with the cntf see table 1 the agnsf cntf heterojunction also showed a significant photoelectric response in the ultra wide band from ultraviolet to terahertz wavelengths except for terahertz and mid infrared wavelengths the response time was on an order of tens of milliseconds and the light responsivity was tens of millivolts per watt seebeck effect plays a leading role in photovoltage generation including some photoelectric effects related to incident laser wavelength the agnsf cntf heterojunction can not only be made into a fast response ultra wideband photodetector but also can be used as a high efficiency sensitive thermal collector the agnsf cntf heterostructure has good application prospects as a high quality photothermoelectric material methods preparation of the sample we first prepared a agnsf by a solid state ionics method 13 a mask with a length of 2 cm was placed on the glass substrate under the conditions of temperature of 30 c and vacuum degree of 3 10 3 pa 880 mg of silver was evaporated on the glass substrate by vacuum thermal evaporation to form two ag film electrodes with a spacing of 2 cm a layer of rbag 4 i 5 film with a thickness of hundreds of nanometers was then evaporated on the entire substrate under the same conditions using a keithley 2400 source meter a constant current of 1 a was applied to the two silver film electrodes and the samples were continuously grown for 98 h and the agnsf was obtained the cntf was prepared by chemical vapor deposition cvd 33 the parameters were an argon gas flow rate of 2000 ml min 1 a hydrogen flow rate of 600

agnsf cntf van der waals heterojunction is shown in supplementary figure 2 first a clean glass was chosen as substrate a small piece of agnsf was then cut transferred to the glass substrate with tweezers a drop of anhydrous ethanol was added to attach the agnsf to the surface of the glass substrate supplementary figure 2 a a small piece of the cntf was then cut transferred to the glass substrate with tweezers and its left end was overlapped with the upper surface of the right end of the agnsf a drop of anhydrous ethanol was then added when the anhydrous ethanol evaporated the van der waals force bound the cntf and agnsf together and the agnsf cntf van der waals heterojunction formed supplementary figure 2 b finally wires were drawn from the other ends of the agnsf and cntf and then the wires were fixed with silver paint supplementary figure 2 c the overlapped area between the agnsf and the cntf was about 1 5 mm 2 0 mm a low magnification scanning electron microscopy image

supplementary figure 3 d voltage current characteristics measurement figure 3 a is the set up used to measure the current voltage curves of the sample the agnsf was connected to the positive electrode of a keithley 2400 source meter and the cntf was connected to negative electrode of the source meter at room temperature and atmospheric conditions the heterojunction was irradiated with lasers with different wavelengths wavelength 375 nm spot diameter 2 5 mm output power 110 mw wavelength 405 nm spot diameter 1 5 mm output power 169 mw wavelength 532 nm spot diameter 1 2 mm output power 246 8 mw

photoelectrical response performance test to explore the photoelectric response performance of the device we irradiated the agnsf cntf sample with lasers with wavelengths of 375 nm 405 nm 532 nm 633 nm 1064 nm 10 6 m and 118 8 m the continuous laser was modulated into periodic intermittent light of a certain frequency through an optical shutter supplementary figure 4 the photovoltage generated at both ends of the sample with and without illumination were then recorded by a tektronix dpo 5104 b high frequency oscilloscope and the photovoltage time response curves were plotted to make the photovoltage time curves more accurate and completely reflect the photoelectric response process of the sample we set the cycle of optical shutter switching for laser irradiation to 10 s for terahertz wave irradiation it takes a long time to achieve a stable photovoltage output so we set the cycle of optical shutter switching to 2 min at the same time an optris pi 640 infrared camera was used to synchronize the video of the thermal distribution on the surface of the sample with and without light to record the change of the surface temperature of the sample with time see supplementary
