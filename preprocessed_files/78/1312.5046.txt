acceleration to finite velocity vfin 8 5 km s the acceleration length lacc 2 27 km the dipoles are accelerated at the forefront of the current pulse running through the spiral up the accelerated magnetic dipoles have mass m 1 kg diameter dsh 20 mm overall length ltot 65 cm the length of the conical part of the lcone 20 cm when selecting the drag coefficient cx and the lift coefficient cy equal to 10 2 the dipoles rise to height h 10 km during a period of time 14 s thus reaching the vertical velocity vr 1 km s and reducing the forward velocity till v 7 5 km s the magnetic dipoles reach flight range smax 12300 km introduction there is a known 1 method of accelerating the magnetic dipole the gauss gun a version of the electromagnetic mass accelerator named after the german scientist carl gauss who laid the foundations of the mathematical theory of electromagnetism the gauss gun consists of a solenoid with a trunk inside usually dielectric one end of the stem is inserted into the shell made of ferromagnetic material when the electric current flows in the solenoid the magnetic field which appears there accelerates the projectile pulling it into the solenoid to keep the solenoid shell against being involved into the opposite direction i e not to slow down the solenoid must be turned off at this moment that is why for the greatest effect the current pulse in the solenoid must be short lived and powerful as a rule electrical capacitors with high voltage are used to obtain this pulse however despite the apparent simplicity of the gauss gun and obvious advantages its practical use is accompanied with serious complications among ferromagnetic materials being used in the magnetic dipoles iron is the most suitable one because of its high specific magnetic moment and high curie temperature the specific magnetic moment is a property of the useable substances and can not be increased moreover due to the fact that the magnetic dipole must also include the jet engine with the fuel and navigation devices the 2 specific magnetic dipole moment will be even less than that of the pure iron it does not allow the magnetic dipole in the gauss gun to reach the high finite velocity to increase the finite velocity of the magnetic dipole it is possible by two ways to increase the amplitude of the accelerating current pulse or the specific magnetic moment a significant increase of the amplitude of the pulse causes a strong need to increase the dielectric durability of the insulation the superconducting coil located inside the magnetic dipole increases the specific magnetic moment by several times in comparison with a pure iron dipole this can significantly increase the acceleration rate and finite velocity of the magnetic dipoles to achieve the speed of 8 5 km s it is necessary to increase the length of the acceleration by a few kilometers so that the accelerator will have to be placed horizontally the corresponding angle between the direction of the velocity and the horizon which is needed to go up through the atmosphere must be installed by the lift force acting on the magnetic dipole this means that the head part of the magnetic dipole must have the corresponding asymmetry and the magnetic dipole should have the parts stabilizing its orientation in space accelerator 1 pre acceleration of the magnetic dipoles with the gas dynamic method to speed up the magnetic dipoles by the field of the running wave the wave must be very slow it must be mentioned that the relative velocity 10 6 where v c c 3 105 km s the speed of light in vacuum consistent with the normal speed equal to v 0 3 km s and it is less than the speed of the sound in the air the gas dynamic acceleration method does not allow one to reach the speed significantly higher than the speed of the sound in the air for example specifications of the gun ap 35 1000 produced by the german company rheinmetall are as follows the initial rate of shooting vin 1 5 km s the diameter of the projectile dsh 35 mm the company mauser is developing an aircraft gun with a caliber diameter of the projectile dsh 30 35 mm and the initial projectile velocity vin 1 8 km s to achieve a low drag coefficient of the magnetic dipole it is required to have a form of the dipole to be a cylinder with a pointed cone at the head part at the same time due to a small diameter of the magnetic dipole and its great length it 3 will be difficult to achieve the initial velocity vin like in the aircraft guns therefore in this case the initial velocity of the magnetic dipole should be smaller than vin 1 5 km s probably the use of the sabot projectile would allow one to achieve a greater initial velocity than we suppose 2 selection of the basic parameters let us choose the parameters of the accelerated dipole dsh 20 mm diameter of the total length of the dipole ltot 65 cm the length of the conical part lcone 20 cm the magnetic dipole is made of iron the initial velocity of the magnetic dipole vin 0 6 km s the finite velocity of the magnetic dipole vfin 8 5 km s the gradient of the magnetic field in the pulse accelerating the magnetic dipole is taken as hzw z g 2 kgs cm the magnetic moment per atom in iron 2 page 524 is of the value mfe 2 219 bohr magneton the table value of the bohr magneton is 2 page 31 mb 9 27 10 21 erg gs taking into account that the atomic weight of iron afe is afe 56 we find that the magnetic moment per nucleon of the iron is mfe 2 10 10 ev gs nucleon the specific magnetic dipole moment may be increased if to place inside the dipole a superconducting coil of nb 3 sn and let the ring current go via it 3 the opportunity of increasing the specific magnetic moment in a magnetic dipole we calculate how much the specific magnetic moment the magnetic moment per unit of the magnetic dipole mass will grow if in its cylindrical part with a length equal to lcyl 40 cm there is a superconducting layer of nb 3 sn with radius rcyl 1 cm and thickness cyl 0 2 cm we assume that the current density in the superconductor is equal to 2 page 312 jsc 3 x 10 5 a cm 2 then linear density jsc of current a cm in the superconducting layer will be jsc a cm jsc cyl 6 10 4 a cm this linear current density on the surface of the superconductor will create the magnetic field hsc kgs 1 226 j a cm 70 kgs which does not contradict the opportunity of achieving the current density jsc 3 10 5 a cm 2 2 page 312 the total current flowing in the superconducting layer is equal to isc jsc lcyl 2 4 10 6 a and will cause the magnetic moment equal to 4 msc isc rcyl 2 7 106 a cm 2 or in the system cgs msc 7 10 5 erg gs the total mass of the superconducting layer can be calculated from the fact that the density of nb 3 sn superconductor is nb 3 sn 8 g cm 3 atomic mass a 400 and the total superconductor vsc 50 cm 3 contains nnb 3 sn 2 4 10 26 nucleons the specific magnetic moment the magnetic moment per mass unit nucleon will be equal to the following msc msc nnb 3 sn 2 10 9 ev gs nucleon which is about 10 times higher than in iron 2 page 524 let the mass of iron in the magnetic dipole be mfe 0 4 kg the mass of the superconductor is also mnb 3 sn 0 4 kg the mass of the jet engine fuel instruments navigation and control devices is mfuel 0 2 kg then the specific magnetic moment in the magnetic dipole will be as follows mmd 8 8 10 10 ev gs nucleon which is approximately by 4 4 times greater than in iron let us take the gradient of the magnetic field accelerating the magnetic dipoles to be equal to hzw z 2 kgs cm in this case the rate of the energy gain by the magnetic dipole will be wsh m hzw z 1 76 10 6 ev cm nucleon to achieve the energy gain from the initial to the finite energy wfin corresponding to the finite velocity vfin 8 5 km s wfin 0 4 ev nucleon the acceleration length lacc wfin wsh 2 27 km is required 4 ways to achieve the desired parameters of the accelerator now we come to defining the spiral where the acceleration of magnetic dipoles is expected to take place with a specific magnetic moment m 8 8 10 10 ev gs nucleon from the initial velocity in 2 10 6 to the finite velocity fin 2 83 10 5 v c c 3 x 1010 cm s velocity of light in vacuum the radii of the spiral 3 the initial and finite ones are taken as follows r 0 in 50 cm r 0 fin 30 cm the accelerator due to damping will be divided into sections therefore within one section it is possible to choose the initial and finite values of the parameter x 2 r 0 0 close to the optimal ones and equal to x 6 28 50 2 10 6 1 3 108 1 2 5 selection of wavelength 0 1 3 10 8 means that we have chosen the pulse duration to be equal to the following f 0 c 0 230 hz pulse 1 2 f 0 2 17 ms the slowdown wavelength is equal to the following 0 2 10 6 1 3 108 260 cm and the magnetic field gradient hzw z g 2 kgs cm and corresponds to the amplitude of the magnetic field pulse hzw 82 8 kgs this amplitude of the magnetic field can be found from the relation hzw z k 3 hzw 2 hzw 0 from this we get the value hzw 0 g 2 82 8 kgs to find the power flux needed to generate the magnetic field of this strength we find a relation between the components of the electric field ezw e 0 i 0 k 1 r and of the magnetic field h zw k 1 k tg i 0 k 1 r 0 e 0 i 0 k 1 r i 1 k 1 r 0 3 for the interior of the spiral where k 1 is the transverse wave vector k c 1 2 the wave vector r 0 the radius of the spiral the expression is as follows k 1 k 1 ph tg h 2 r 0 so k 1 k tg 1 2 at the beginning of the spiral k 1 r 0 1 2 and the ratio of i 0 k 1 r 0 i 1 k 1 r 0 2 thus the component of the magnetic field hzw 82 8 kgs on the spiral axis that corresponds to the electric field strength ezw 347 2 kv cm the value in the brackets in formulae 13 in 3 for the value of the argument x 1 2 1 i 0 k 1 i 1 k 0 i 1 2 i 0 i 2 i 0 k 0 2 1 i 1 k 0 i 0 k 1 k 0 k 2 k 1 2 is 3 77 so that the power required to achieve the electric field strength ezw 347 2 kv cm for the initial speed of the magnetic dipole in 2 10 6 may be found from formula 3 p c 8 ezw 2 r 0 2 1 the wave power in watts is equal to 3 p w 3 1010 3 47 2 1010 2 5 103 2 10 6 1 28 103 3 77 8 9 104 107 12 23 gw 2 according to formula 2 to achieve the magnetic field gradient on the axis of the field g 2 kgs cm it is required to have power p 12 23 gw this power can be achieved by using the pulse technology 6 we introduce the notion of pulse amplitude acc related with the field power on the axis of the spiral e 0 pulse by the following ratios 3 acc e 0 pulse slow 2 slow 0 0 c f 0 3 thus the amplitude of the power pulse propagating along

1800 in the magnetic field pulse by imposing the uniform magnetic field everything would have been well if the dipole were a point but the magnetic dipole is not a point and the action on it by the radial component of the magnetic field leads to roll over a reversal position of the dipole two interacting coils will seek to be placed in such a way that their planes should be parallel to each other and the direction of the currents of the both would be the same in contrast to the forces accelerating the dipole and leading to the radial displacement of the center of mass of the dipole the action of the pair of the forces leading to the reversal of the dipole is summed up the simplest solution that prevents the turn of the dipole by 1800 in the accelerating field of the wave is the imposition of the uniform external magnetic field which won t influence on the acceleration of the dipole because of its homogeneity but will only hold the dipole against the reversal in the 7 space impose the external magnetic field hout on the spiral with the dipole to keep it against turning off the magnetic field of the wave is of the order of hzw 82 8 kgs respectively to compensate small deviations sin 1 the external magnetic field must be hout 100 kgs thus we have fixed the magnetic dipole orientation in the space now the reversal moment will act on the turns of the coils which carry the impulse current and therefore they must be reliably fixed one can consider a mechanical model of such an accelerator which should consist of two magnets directed to each other with the same sign poles one of the magnets is a magnetized iron magnetic dipole the second magnet is the current pulse running via the coils of the spiral the one sign poles of the magnets repel each other the current pulse in the spiral is speeding up and accelerates pushes the magnetic dipole in this accelerator technology it is called the automatic phase stability principle 4 thus the running current pulse can only push not pull the dipole being accelerated a dedicated narrow channel trunk holds the magnet being pushed against turning over in our case the constant external magnetic field fulfills the role of this channel the pushing magnet cannot turn around either it is prevented from turning by mechanical forces 6 radial focusing by the magnetic field having a variable component to eliminate the opportunity for the magnetic dipoles to escape along the radius we have to introduce the radial focusing the easiest way to do it is to impose an additional sinusoidal field over the external uniform field hout so that the total field will be a combination of the constant field hout 0 holding the magnetic dipole from the turn around and of the variable component of hout 1 sinkzz which automatically appears when the solenoid coils producing the longitudinal magnetic field hout are positioned quite seldom thus kz 2 az where az is a spatial period of positioning the coils this ripple corrugated hout hout 0 hout 1 sinkzz of the magnetic field leads to the appearance of sign variable gradient of the external magnetic field and the appearance of sign alternative forces in the equation of radial motion assuming k kz 8 r 1 r 2 r 1 w msinkzvzt hout 1 hout 0 hzw kzrb 0 kzc 2 r 1 4 where kzvz oscillation frequency in the external magnetic field we change variables kzvzt outt 2 then t out and the equation 4 can be written as follows r 1 4 r 2 out 2 2 w m hout 1 hout 0 hzw kzrb 0 kzc 2 out 2 sin 2 r 1 5 and thus the equation is reduced to the mathieu equation 5 which describes the transverse motion r a 2 q sin 2 r 0 6 where a 4 r out 2 7 q w m hout 1 hout 0 hzw kzrb 0 kzc 2 out 2 8 depending on the values of parameters a and q in the mathieu equation there are areas of stable and unstable solutions choosing the alignment of the coils forming the magnetic field kz and the current in them hout 1 in such a way that the solution of 6 will be within the range of sustainability and it will be possible to obtain a stable acceleration of the magnetic dipoles the stability condition is as follows 5 0 92 q a simplification by w m kzrb 0 out 2 and hout 0 hzw 1 we get kzc 2 hout 1 8 f 0 z 2 hzw 9 hout 1 8 k 3 kz f 0 zkzc 2 hzw 10 hout 1 4 az slow 2 hzw 11 the amplitude of the alternating field must exceed the field of a wave multiplied by 4 az slow 2 perhaps small focusing magnetic elements can be placed close to the axis of 9 the spiral waveguide just as in the drift tube linear accelerator of alvarez the magnetic elements maybe won t greatly affect the distribution of the accelerating pulse propagating via the spiral waveguide then the spatial period of the magnetic field changes can be made small enough az 10 cm substituting the previous expression with the values hzw 82 8 kgs f 0 230 hz z 2 10 6 az 10 cm c 3 x 10 10 cm s velocity of light in vacuum we obtain hout 1 1 85 10 2 hzw 1 5 kgs 12 this value of the variable component of the magnetic field will generate the sign variable field on the basis of permanent magnets of ndfeb similar to how it is done to focus the electron beams in traveling wave tubes you can even eliminate the static magnetic field but nevertheless hold the dipole against the reversal over the radius to carry out this only by the sign variable magnetic field that has no dc component this result is obtained if the amplitude of the external field hout is 2 times larger than the pulse field hzw multiplied by the ratio of half cycle of the external field az to the spatial length of the pulse lp hout 2 az lp hzw 7 the power damping of the pulse propagating in the spiral wave attenuation in a spiral waveguide will lead to the fact that the amplitude of the pulse traveling along the spiral will decrease while pulse moving from the beginning to the end of the spiral and this power reduction is related with the ohm currents for heating the spiral current i flows through the windings of the spiral and in fact it is ohm losses p w turn i 2 r 13 where i the current going via the coil in amperes r loop resistance in ohms then r turn is expressed in watts we first find the resistance of the coil the resistance is calculated by the usual formula r l s where 1 7 10 6 ohm cm the resistivity of copper the copper coil will be considered l 2 r 0 coil length r 0 the radius 10 of the spiral s the coil cross section since the current flowing via the coil is of high frequency ac a factor appears there and this current penetrates into the conductor for the depth of the skin layer which has to be found the expression for the depth of the skin the layer can be written as follows a 2 0 14 where c 3 x 1010 cm s the speed of light in vacuum 5 4 1017 1 s the conductivity of copper 0 2 f 0 circular frequency f 0 260 hz frequency of the wave propagating in the spiral substituting numerical values in the formula 14 gives 0 4 cm the result is the depth of the skin layer 0 4 cm that is much larger than the distance between the turns of the spiral h 1 n 0 02 cm n 50 the number of turns of the spiral per 1 cm length of the spiral this means that in order to reduce the resistance of one turn and accordingly reduce the attenuation it is necessary to wind the coil as a rather wide tape with a width h 2 0 8 cm the tape should be placed on the wide side h over the radius the distance h between the coils consists of h 2 turns and h 2 space between the coils so that the winding pitch of the value h 2 revolution and the turn occupied the space h 2 to be equal to the space between the coils then the resistance of one coil r l s will be r 2 r 0 2 h 2 2 r 0 h 15 substituting numerical values for the start of spiral r 0 50 cm we find r 1 7 10 6 6 28 50 2 0 4 10 2 6 6 10 2 ohm 16 now we have to find i current in the coils to do this we use the formula hzsurf 4 c ni 17 where hzsurf the magnetic field on the surface of the spiral hzsurf hzw now we can find current ni flowing via the coils of the spiral ni a cm hzsurf 4 c 1 226 1 hzsurf a cm hzsurf gs then the current in one coil is 11 i a hzsurf gs n 18 substituting numerical values into the formula 18 we have found that the current in one coil is i a 82 8 ka cm 50 turns cm 1 656 ka revolution ohm losses of the current in one coil are as follows p w turn i 2 r 90 kw coil 19 since there are n turns per 1 cm the energy losses per 1 cm will be by n times more p w cm i 2 r n 4 5 106 w cm 20 we introduce the ratio p p 2 21 hence 1 ldamping 2 p p 2 12 23 10 9 4 5 106 5 43 103 cm 54 m 22 is the length at which the field power is reduced by a factor of e due to damping it can be seen that the movement of the magnetic dipole while accelerating is necessary to calculate taking into account the damping of the power pulse propagating via the spiral waveguide 8 magnetic dipole capture in the acceleration mode excesses we calculate the required accuracy of coincidence of the initial phase of the accelerating wave pulse with the synchronous phase the theory of particle capture in a traveling wave gives 6 3 s s 2 s in practice it means for example in our case where 4 corresponds to the duration of 1 ms or 900 that one degree corresponds to the time interval of approximately 10 s in linear accelerators the buncher gives the phase width of the bunch 150 and to avoid large phase fluctuations we require that the synchronization accuracy of the magnetic dipole with the accelerating pulse was as follows 15 10 s 150 s such synchronization accuracy seems to be quite reachable for the gunpowder start i e preliminary gas dynamic acceleration 12 of the magnetic dipoles let us now calculate the excess for the accuracy of coincidences of the initial velocity of the magnetic dipole and the phase velocity of the pulse propagating along the spiral structure we introduce value g p ps ps the relative difference between the pulses 6 in the non relativistic case it is just a relative velocity spread out of g v vs vs the vertical range of the separatrix is calculated with the following formula 6 gmax 2 s 0 1 s ctg s 23 wherein s 45 0 4 ctg s 1 1 s ctg s 1 2 0 46 2 0 46 0 9 0 2 f 0 1 44 10 3 s 0 w mctg s

10 8 ctg s 1 substituting numerical values we get g vin vs vs v vs and finally v vs 3 64 10 8 6 28 10 6 2 1 2 0 9 0 05 thus the allowed discrepancy of the initial speed of the magnetic dipole with the pulse transfer is of the order of v vs 5 9 magnetic dipoles from vacuum to atmosphere magnetic dipoles should be accelerated in a rather high vacuum p 1 10 6 mm hg while their use is expected under normal atmospheric conditions p 2 10 3 mm hg so the pressure difference is about nine orders of the magnitude to reach such a pressure gradient we can use several buffer cavities which are cylindrical chambers separated from each other by walls with the imbedded pulse iris diaphragms each cavity should be supplied with individual vacuum pumping we calculate the amount of the air particles which penetrate to the first cavity the nearest one to the atmosphere let the radius of the iris be r 0 d 10 cm and the time to open it t 1 10 3 s then the linear velocity of the iris petals will be v 11 r 0 d t 1 10 4 cm s which should not cause a problem for the operation of the mechanism the average velocity of the thermal motion of the molecules of air v is assumed roughly to be equal to the speed of sound in the air 13 v 3 104 cm s from the various spatial orientations of the velocity only 1 6 1 6 one facet of the cube is directed towards the aperture the number of molecules per cubic centimeter of air under normal conditions the number of loschmidt is 0 l 2 7 10 19 molecule cm 3 then the number of molecules from the atmosphere which penetrated to the first buffer cavity when the diaphragm was open will be as follows n 0 1 6 0 l r 0 d 2 vt 1 24 substituting the numerical values into formula 24 we find that the total number of particles coming from the atmosphere to the first buffer cavity is n 0 4 10 22 particles let the volume of the first cavity is the value equal to v 01 10 3 l 106 cm 3 then the density of molecules in it after the diaphragm shutdown is equal to n 0 4 10 16 molecule cm 3 particle density and pressure p nkt in the first buffer cavity is about 3 orders lower than the density of particles in the atmosphere under normal conditions so at least three cavities of this volume will be required to reach the appropriate pressure gradient now we consider the dynamics of the particle density in the cavity for the period of time between the shutdowns of the trigger device let the cavity be pumped out through the hole of the square of s 1 10 4 cm 2 we assume that all the molecules which got into this area are removed from the volume it is supposed that the time between the cycles is t 2 10 1 s it means that the frequency of operation of the device is equal to f 10 hz the equation describing the reduction of the density of the particles while pumping out can be written as follows dn n 1 6 s 1 vt v 01 25 the solution of this equation can be written as n n 0 exp 1 6 s 1 vt v 01 26 for evacuation time t t 2 the exponent is approximately equal to 5 thus due to pumping out the density of molecules in the first buffer cavity is reduced by more than 100 times n n 0 7 10 3 the density of particles in the first volume of the buffer before the next shutdown will be the value of 14 n 1 4 10 16 7 3 10 3 1014 molecule cm 3 that is by 5 orders of magnitude less than the number of loschmidt 0 l 2 7 10 19 molecule cm 3 corresponding to the number of molecules per cubic centimeter of the air under normal conditions it is evident that before the next shutdown the cavity can be considered to be empty figure 1 shows a possible scheme of the device

dipole at this velocity equal to the first space velocity will rotate along a circular orbit and will not fall back to the earth for the parameters of the magnetic dipole vr 1 km s and v 7 5 km s the time tmax of lifting to the maximal height and return to the starting point is tmax 1650 s and therefore the flight range of the magnetic dipole is equal to smax v tmax 12300 km if to increase the length of the accelerator and consequently the finite velocity of the magnetic dipoles their velocity after passing through the atmosphere will be more than 8 km s and thus the dipoles are displayed onto near the earth orbit conclusion the magnetic moment of a current carrying coil increases as the square of the coil that is the square of the radius growth the coil perimeter its mass grows with the radius increasing linearly so that the specific magnetic moment the magnetic moment per nucleon in the loop will grow linearly with the radius of the magnetic dipole to limit the growth of the radius will be necessary for the sake of the sharp cone in the head part of the magnetic dipole to have a pointed cone with the growing radius of the dipole it will be necessary to increase its length you can give up using the constant magnetic field holding the magnetic dipoles against the turn by 1800 and alternating magnetic field keeping the magnetic dipoles near the axis of the acceleration if the acceleration is carried out in a narrow trunk this trunk can be made of a titanium thin walled tube 19 with a wall thickness hw 2 mm however it is not clear how small it is necessary to choose the synchronous phase to resist the force of friction which is not regular between the projectile and the walls of the trunk literature 1 http ru wikipedia org wiki 2 tables of physical quantities
