this article considers the acceleration of electric dipoles consisting of thin metal plates and dielectric barium titanate the dipoles are of a cylindrical shape with a diameter of the cylinder dout 2 cm and length dd 1 sm capacity of the parallel plate capacitor is c 278 pf and it is charged up to the voltage of u 280 kv pre acceleration of the electric dipoles till velocity vin 1 km s is reached by the gas dynamic method the finite acceleration is produced in a spiral waveguide where the pulse is travelling with voltage amplitude uacc 700 kv and power p 125 mw this pulse travels via the spiral waveguide and accelerates the injected electric dipoles in the longitudinal direction till the finite velocity vfin 8 5 km s over length lacc 0 77 km introduction there is a known 1 method of accelerating the magnetic dipoles which enables one to accelerate the magnetic dipoles by the running current pulse to increase the specific magnetic moment inside the dipoles we place a superconducting coil with the excited current in it however this method of accelerating the magnetic dipoles has a serious drawback during all the period of acceleration and time of flight to the target it is necessary to keep the low temperature and superconductivity inside the magnetic dipole otherwise due to a large energy release in the magnetic dipole it can just collapse another known 2 method of accelerating the charged bodies is as follows the body is pre accelerated up to the velocity corresponding to the velocity of injection into the spiral waveguide then the body is irradiated with an electron beam injected from the electron accelerator it is electrically charged and finally accelerated by the same voltage pulse running inside the coils of the spiral waveguide to set several electrons onto the body is not a problem but further on when there are many electrons on the body they will begin to run away from it due to the auto electron emission let the field strength for electron emission be as follows e 3 107 v cm after reaching this field strength no matter how 2 many electrons you put on the body they will flow away from the body due to the coulomb repulsion having planted enough electrons to plant more it is necessary to overcome the repulsion of those which are already there this means that the energy of the electrons which we want to put onto the body should be large enough so that they can overcome this coulomb barrier reach the body and stay on it coulomb barrier grows for the particles of the cylindrical form linearly with increasing of the diameter and for particles with diameter d 20 mm it will reach 30 mev to overcome it it will be necessary to accelerate electrons in a specialized accelerator the essence of this proposal is to consider the acceleration of the electric dipoles but not the charged bodies the acceleration rate for this case has been found to be equal to the following w z ne a e 2 dd s e 0 zw sin s where w z a set of plate capacitor energy per unit of the length ene a electrical charge of any sign located on a plate capacitor and per nucleon in it dd the distance between the plates of a parallel plate capacitor s slow down wavelength in the spiral waveguide e 0 zw the amplitude of the wave s synchronous phase acceleration of the plate capacitor is produced in the dielectric channel which prevents the turn of the dipole by 180 degrees and its deviation from the axis of the acceleration 1 acceleration of electric dipoles on the electric dipoles it is possible to set a large number of related charges i e the charges having opposite signs and thus we get a plate capacitor the total electric charge in the capacitor will be equal to zero but such electric dipoles will possess a rather large electric dipole moment which can interact with the electric field gradient 1 1 parameters of the electric dipole let us consider the acceleration of the cylindrical capacitor having an outer diameter dout 2 cm the distance between the electrodes is equal to dd 1 cm where as dielectric we use ceramic capacitor t 900 with a relative permittivity 103 and a breakdown voltage u 28 kv mm 3 page 321 we assume the 3 density of the ceramic capacitor to be equal to 6 g cm 3 4 to find the specific electric charge of the capacitor we neglect the mass of the metal plates the square and volume of the dielectric are sd dout 2 4 3 14 cm 2 vd sd dd 3 14 cm 3 respectively and the mass is md vd 18 8 g we find an electric charge on the capacitor the capacity of the flat capacitor in the practical system of coordinates is as follows c 0 sd dd 278 pf 1 where 0 8 85 10 12 f m dielectric permittivity of vacuum such a capacitor can be charged up to 280 kv 3 page 321 so that the electric charge expressed in practical units will be q cu 7 8 10 5 coulomb 2 i e the capacitor will contain ne 7 8 10 5 6 1018 4 7 1014 electrons the number of nucleons in this cylinder is equal to a 1 13 1025 nucleons the ratio of the charge to the mass in such a capacitor will be equal to the following ne a e 4 1 10 11 1 2 acceleration of the dipoles similarly to the gradient of the magnetic field accelerating the magnetic dipole the acceleration of the electric dipole is carried out by the gradient of the electric field of the wave fe ne a e dezw dz 3 as for the magnetic dipole the gradient of the electric field of the wave is dezw dz k 3 ezw k 3 2 s where s 0 ph slowdown wave length in the structure ph vph c relative phase velocity of the wave in a spiral waveguide c 3 1010 cm s velocity of light in vacuum finally fe ne a e 2 dd s ezw 0 sin s 4 4 where ezw 0 the amplitude of the electric field strength on the axis of the spiral before substituting the numbers into formula 4 we make a few general remarks first of all it should be stressed that force fe accelerating the electric dipoles does not depend on the length of the dipole dd indeed while decreasing dd the capacitance c of a the plate capacitor grows but at the same time the breakdown voltage u decreases thus the charge stored in the capacitor does not depend on parameter dd when parameter dd decreases the mass of the dielectric reduces and the specific electric charge the charge per unit of the mass increases however while decreasing dd the accelerating force fe acting on the dipole decreases this is due to the fact that the accelerating force is the difference between the repulsive force of one pole and the electric force of the other pole from 4 it is clear that this force is greater the greater the distance dd is between the dipole poles moreover the accelerating force acting on the electric dipole is independent of sd the transverse dipole square indeed with the growth of this square the charge stored in the capacitor increases but simultaneously in the same proportions the mass of the dielectric also grows this leads to the independence of the specific electrical charge of the capacitor on its transverse cross section it is important to mention that in the case with a magnetic dipole the situation is different the magnetic moment of the coil with the current grows as the square of the coil i e the square of the increasing radius the mass of the coil increases as the perimeter of the coil i e linearly with the increasing radius that results in linear increasing of the specific magnetic moment with the increasing radius of the coil with the current now we substitute the numbers into the formula 4 the first factor ne a e determines the maximum electric charge per nucleon which can be stored in the capacity as it is shown above this charge is determined only by the properties of the substance in this case by the properties of the capacitor ceramic i e by the highest possible relative permittivity and maximum breakdown voltage u probably materials with better properties will be developed later the second factor 2 dd s is determined by the ratio of the length of the 5 dipole dd to the slowdown wavelength s in the spiral waveguide at a large length of the accelerator it will be necessary to divide the accelerator into separate sections each of them will be individually supplied with power then it will be possible to accelerate the dipoles in each section at the optimal frequency for each section which in the case of the spiral waveguide is defined by the following ratio s 2 r 0 where r 0 the radius of the spiral the diameter of the spiral may be chosen slightly larger than d out diameter of the capacity for example d out 2 r 0 0 5 and then the parameter is equal to dd r 0 0 5 finally for ezw ezw 0 sin s 250 kv cm we find fe ne a e 2 dd s ezw 5 2 10 4 ev m nucleon 5 thus to achieve the finite velocity vfin 8 5 km s wfin 0 4 ev nucleon the acceleration length will be required to be equal to lacc wfin fe 0 77 km 6 2 the structure of the accelerator fig 1 shows the scheme of the accelerator fig 1 fig 1 shows 1 gun carrying out the gas dynamic acceleration of electric dipoles 2 electric dipoles pre charged electrical capacitors 3 section of the spiral waveguide 4 dielectric channel located on the axis of the system where the acceleration of the electric dipoles is carried out 6 2 1 pre acceleration of the electric dipoles by using the gas dynamic method to accelerate the electric dipoles by the field of the traveling wave this wave must be very slow it should be mentioned that the relative velocity 10 6 corresponds to the normal velocity equal to v 0 3 km s and is less than the velocity of the sound in the air the gas dynamic acceleration method does not allow one to achieve a higher velocity than vg 2 km s for example specifications of the gun ap 35 1000 produced by the german company rheinmetall are as follows the initial rate of shooting vin 1 5 km s the diameter of the projectile dsh 35 mm the company mauser is developing an aircraft gun with a caliber diameter of the projectile dsh 30 35 mm and a projectile velocity vin 1 8 km s we take the initial velocity of the electric dipoles to be reached after the gas dynamic acceleration equal to vin 1 km s 2 2 spiral step we have to take a very small step of spiral winding since we have chosen the radius of the spiral to be equal to r 0 2 cm then to get the spiral slowdown equal to ph in 3 3 10 6 where ph in vin c initial phase velocity expressed in the units of the light velocity and coinciding with the initial velocity of the electric dipoles the slowdown in the spiral is purely geometrical in the simplest case the phase velocity of the wave expressed in the units of the light velocity in the spiral waveguide is equal to ph tg 7 where tg the tangent of the winding angle the tangent in the case of large decelerations is equal to tg h 2 r 0 the ratio of the step of spiral winding to the perimeter of the coil besides purely geometric slowdown of the wave in the spiral it is possible to slow it down additionally if to place the spiral totally inside the dielectric medium with a relative permittivity for barium titanate near the curie point it is possible to achieve the following values 8 103 5 page 557 7 but we take a smaller value of 1 28 103 the relationship between the phase velocity of the wave propagating in the spiral and its parameters in this case can be written in the following form 6 ph tg 8 the area inside the spiral should be left free of the dielectric because the acceleration of the electric dipoles will take place in this region along the axis of the spiral then for the spiral where the dielectric has filled the region located between the coil and the external screen the dispersion equation the equation relating the parameters of the spiral with the phase velocity of the wave looks as follows 6 ph 2 tg 9 for the start of the spiral where the velocity of the electric dipoles is equal to vin 1 km s ph in 3 3 10 6 r 0 2 cm 1 28 10 3 from 9 we find that the winding step of the spiral must be equal to h 10 3 cm 10 the amplitude of the field strength ezw 0 which we have chosen is equal to ezw 0 ezw sin s 350 kv cm sin s 0 7 at step h 10 3 cm 10 there is a risk of the electric breakdown of the dielectric breakdown voltage of the polyimide is 300 mv m 5 page 550 or 300 v thus you can choose the spiral structure to be as follows copper coil with a cross section of 8 and isolation of polyimide 2 microns thick 2 3 the required wave power relationship between the power flux and the wave strength on the spiral is given by the following formula 6 p c 8 ezw 0 2 r 0 2 ph 1 i 0 k 1 i 1 k 0 i 1 2 i 0 i 2 i 0 k 0 2 1 i 1 k 0 i 0 k 1 k 0 k 2 k 1 2 11 the argument of the modified bessel functions of the first and second types presented in the curly brackets is the value of x 2 r 0 s which we have chosen to be equal to x 1 then for this argument the second term in curly 8 brackets is much greater than the first term and the curly bracket itself is equal to 3 77 substituting the numbers into the formula 11 1280 we find p w 3 1010 3 5 3 5 1010 4 3 3 10 6 3 77 1 28 103 8 300 300 107 125 mw in order to reach the field strength at the axis of the spiral to be equal to ezw 0 350 kv cm it is required to introduce power p 125 mw this power can be achieved by the pulse technology we expand the sinusoidal pulse 6 corresponding to the half wave epulse e 0 pulsesin 2 t 0 t 2 t 0 0 0 2 f 0 in a fourier row t 0 2 f 1 2 1 2 sin 0 t sin t dt 12 0 the pulse spectrum is rather narrow and covers the frequency range from 0 to 2 0 since the spiral waveguide dispersion in dependence of the phase velocity on frequency is weak it can be expected that the full range of frequencies from 0 to 2 0 will propagate approximately with the same phase velocity as a result the half wave sinusoidal pulse in vacuum will spread out only due to increasing of the phase velocity of the wave in this case matching of the spiral waveguide with a power feeder is necessary to carry out in the frequency band f 0 2 we introduce the notion of the pulse amplitude uacc related with the field strength at the axis of the spiral ezw 0 by the following ratio 6 uacc ezw 0 s 2 s 0 0 c f 0 13 in this case the vacuum wavelength 0 is 0 s in 4 18 10 6 cm the wave frequency f 0 c f 0 7 1 10 3 hz half life the duration of the pulse on the basis is equal to t 0 2 1 2 f 0 90 s thus the amplitude of the voltage pulse propagating along the spiral must 9 be equal to uacc ezw 0 s 2 700 kv the table below summarizes the main parameters of the accelerator table parameters of the accelerator 2 4 phase stability it is known that in the traveling wave the phase stability region is on the front slope of the wave pulse indeed if the particle is faster than the wave it will get into the weakening field and finally the speeding up pulse will soon catch up with the particle if the particle is behind its phase it will get into the region of the strengthening field and acquire more energy in comparison with what would have been obtained in the synchronous phase and eventually the particle will catch up with its phase thus from the viewpoint of the mutual position of the particle and the acceleration pulse there is only possible case when the pulse pushes but not pulls the particle in our calculations we have chosen the synchronous phase to be equal to s 45 0 sin s 0 7 to achieve a greater rate of acceleration it is possible to choose a greater value s 60 0 sin s 0 87 but then at the acceleration it will be needed to meet more strict requirements parameter value number of electrons per nucleon in the electric dipole z a e z a e 4 1 10 11 the

voltage u u 700 kv 10 it is known that while acceleration of particles in azimuthal symmetrical field the phase stability corresponds to the radial instability this means that when we push the particle by the pulse we push it not only forward but also a bit on the radius the force acting on the particle increases linearly with the growth of particle deviation from the axis and the initial deviation increases exponentially to keep the particles near the axis it is necessary to introduce focusing while accelerating i e it is necessary to use additional forces fields which will return the particle to the axis of the acceleration 2 5 preventing the turn of the dipole by 1800 in the electric field of the pulse and keeping it on the axis of the dipole acceleration in the acceleration of the dipoles there is a new problem which did not exist while accelerating the point particles the pulse accelerating the dipole will lead to a roll over of the dipole turn it by 180 degrees this problem is easier to see with the example of the acceleration of the magnetic dipoles and conventional magnets by the running current pulse if such a pulse pushing the magnet to substitute by another magnet it can be seen that the magnet being pushed will not be easy to push from the same sign pole of the pushing magnet but it will try to turn by 180 degrees and pull itself to the opposite sign pole the action of the pair of forces leading to the reversal of the dipole is summed up in comparison with the difference forces accelerating the dipole and leading to the radial displacement of the center of mass the simplest solution that prevents reversal of the magnetic dipoles by 180 degrees in the accelerating wave field is the imposition of the uniform external magnetic field it won t influence the acceleration of the dipole because of its homogeneity but will only hold the dipole against the reversal in the space by analogy with the uniform magnetic field which does not affect the acceleration of the dipoles but keeps the magnetic dipoles against the reversal by 180 degrees it is possible to use the uniform electric field to hold the electric dipole against the reversal 11 the intensity of the electric field must be at least of a larger wave amplitude i e ekeep 350 kv cm when acceleration length lacc is 1 km the electrostatic field for this purpose is not acceptable since in this case a tremendous difference of potentials would take place the uniform electric field can be formed by the induction method let the length of the inductor be along the acceleration axis lind 10 cm such a length will be covered by the electric dipole with velocity vin 1 km s during the period of time equal to ind 10 4 s hence the induction method should create tension uind ekeep lind 3 5 mv for the period of time ind 10 4 s multiplying these values we find that the required amount of the magnetic flux is f 350 t m 2 let this flux be created by iron re magnetization from the value of 1 t till the value of 1 t then the cross section of the iron in the inductor should be sind 175 m 2 then at the length of the inductor along the acceleration axis lind 10 cm its radial length should be rind 1750 m that is not justified either it is possible to hold the electric dipoles near the acceleration and at the same time to keep them against turning by 180 degrees if you keep the acceleration of the electric dipoles in a narrow dielectric channel located on the axis of the system in this case at the longitudinal acceleration of the electric dipoles in the channel the dipole will undergo friction with the walls of the channel 2 6 the influence of friction we consider how strong the friction of the side surface of the electric dipoles over the internal surface of the channel will influence the acceleration the side surface of the electric dipoles must be dielectric to it avoid the short current in the capacitor the channel must be also dielectric not to screen the electric field accelerating the electric dipoles along the spiral structure actually the friction force directed against the accelerating force is equal to the coefficient of friction multiplied by the radial force pressing the electric dipoles towards the inner surface of the channel in its turn the radial force proportional to the acceleration force and deviation of the electric dipole from the axis is absent when the center of the electric dipoles is located on the axis of the system 12 let the deviation of the electric dipoles from the axis of the system is 1 of its radius dout 2 1 cm i e r 100 from the expansion of the bessel function of the first order with a small argument it is clear that a pair of forces acting on a dipole is equal to the following fr 2 r s ne a e 2 dd s ezw 14 a typical value of the coefficient of friction for example by cellophane 5 page 128 is kfr 0 4 on the one hand the coefficient of friction increases when the friction surfaces are in vacuum on the other hand it decreases with increasing of the relative velocity of motion we assume that for our velocity of the electric dipoles moving within the channel the friction coefficient is about the same value then the ratio of force directed against velocity ff to the force of acceleration is equal to ff fe kfr 2 r s 2 10 2 15 that will be compensated by phase stability according to hooke s law we find the elastic force felas which will prevent the compression of the electric dipoles r dout felas e sc 16 where r dout 5 10 3 relative compression e young s modulus sc the contact surface at a height of

equal to e 108 n m 2 3 p 53 and from 16 we find that the value of force felas is felas 15 n that is comparable with radial force fr which must be multiplied by the number of nucleons a 1 13 1025 fr 5 10 3 5 2 10 4 1 6 10 19 1 13 1025 5 n it is clear that the elastic force returning the center of gravity of the electric 13 dipoles onto the axis of the system will prevent a significant radial displacement of the center of gravity of the electric dipoles relatively the axis of the system conclusions the efficiency of the acceleration of charged cylindrical bodies decreases with increasing of the diameter of the cylinder this is due to the fact that the electric charge is located on the cylinder surface the square of the unit of the cylinder length increases as the radius of the cylinder and the volume and mass increase as the square of the radius as a result the charge per unit of the nucleon mass reduces with increasing of the radius as 1 r from a certain radius the acceleration rate of the electric dipoles by the wave field gradient becomes greater than the acceleration rate of the charged bodies the choice of electric dipoles in the form of a plate capacitor allows the electric dipoles to reach the first order space velocity at a distance less than one kilometer literature 1 s n dolya methods of acceleration of the magnetic dipoles patent of the russian
