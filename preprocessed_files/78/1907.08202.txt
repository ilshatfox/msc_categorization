beam after passing through a pair of convex lenses with different focal distances it is shown that while the transverse spot size of such a beam is scaled by the lens focal ratio f 2 f 1 the longitudinal pattern which can be chosen on de mand is scaled by the quadratic factor f 2 f 1 2 the results here presented can be important in the generation of structured light beams within very small spatial regions 2 mathematical description from geometric optics we know that a light beam represented by parallel rays with spot radius r 1 after passing through a system of two convex lenses l 1 and l 2 positioned in such a way to share the same focal plane see fig 1 will acquire a spot radius r 2 f 2 f 1 r 1 1 1 ar x iv 1 90 7 08 20 2 v 2 ph ys ic s op ti cs 2 4 s ep 2 01 9 where f 1 and f 2 are the focal distances of the first and second lens respectively figure 1 sketch of a frozen wave in a two convex lens system now we are going to show in a rigorous way what happens to a fw beam when it passes through the system of two convex lenses as shown in fig 1 let us consider a frozen wave i incident on the first lens given by i z n q n aqj 0 hiq e i iqz 2 where hiq and iq the transverse and longitudinal wave numbers respectively of the bessel beams that constitute the fw beam are given by hiq 2 k k q 2 l q 3 and in the paraxial approximation iq k h 2 iq 2 k q 2 l q 4 with the coefficients aq given by aq 1 l l 0 f z e i 2 q l zdz 5 in the above equations q and l are constants and f z is a function chosen at will a beam given by eqs 2 3 4 5 is a structured non diffracting beam whose longitudinal intensity pattern within 0 z l given by f z 2 can be chosen on demand while the spot radius r 1 is approximately given by 2 r 1 2 4 hi 0 6 for the interested reader the fw theory is developed with details in 1 2 3 now let us calculate the field after the first lens l 1 but before the second one by using the fresnel diffraction integral z ik z eikze ik 2 2 z 0 0 e ik 2 2 z j 0 k z d 7 where for this case 0 is the product of two terms the incident frozen wave from equation 2 and the lens transfer function for l 1 the exponential term 0 i 0 e ik 2 2 f 1 8 by using eq 8 in 7 the field that emanates from the first lens is given by z l 1 e ikz ik z e ik 2 2 z n q n aq 0 d j 0 hiq j 0 k z e ik 2 2 f 1 e ik 2 2 z 9 in order to solve the integral from equation 9 we use the following result from 4 0 xe a 2 x 2 jp x jp x dx 1 2 a 2 e 2 2 4 a 2 ip 2 a 2 10 and get z l 1 e ikz 1 z f 1 n q n aqf 1 e ik 2 2 z f 1 e i h 2 iq f 1 2 k z f 1 z j 0 hiqf 1 z f 1 11 when l 1 reaches the second lens at z f 1 f 2 the field becomes z f 1 f 2 eik f 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 n q n aqe i k 2 2 f 2 e i h 2 iq f 1 f 1 f 2 2 kf 2 j 0 hiqf 1 f 2 12 at this point we have that 12 is the wave incident on the second lens and that the field following it t can also be calculated by using the fresnel diffraction integral 7 taking into account the transfer function of such lens t z e ikz ik z e ik 2 2 z n q n 0 d 1 eik f 1 f 2 ei h 2 i f 1 f 1 f 2 2 kf 2 f 1 f 2 aqj 0 hif 1 f 2 ei k 2 2 z j 0 k z 13 where z 0 is now the position of the second lens by using eq 10 we get 3 t z 1 eik f 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 eikz n q n aqe ih 2 iq f 1 f 1 f 2 2 kf 2 e i f 1 f 2 hiq 2 2 k zj 0 hiqf 1 f 2 14 now since h 2 iq 2 k k iq 15 and iq q 2 q l 16 the transmitted field becomes t z 1 f 1 f 2 eik f 1 f 2 e iz k f 1 f 2 2 k q n q n aqe i h 2 iq f 1 f 1 f 2 2 kf 2 j 0 hiqf 1 f 2 e iz 2 q l f 2 f 1 2 17 in equation 17 it can be seen that appearance of the term exp ih 2 i f 1 f 1 f 2 2 kf 2 into the summation this exponential term affects the longitudinal pattern by displacing it by making z z f 2 f 1 f 1 f 2 the field becomes t z 1 f 1 f 2 eik f 1 f 2 e ik f 2 f 1 f 1 f 2 e iz k f 1 f 2 2 k q n q n aqj 0 hiqf 1 f 2 e iz 2 q l f 2 f 1 2 18 with aq 1 l f 2 f 1 2 l f 2 f 1 2 0 f f 2 f 1 2 z e i 2 q l f 2 f 1 2 zdz 19 where z z f 2 f 1 2 equations 18 19 show us that transverse spot size of such the fw scales with the lens focal ratio f 2 f 1 and the longitudinal intensity pattern scales with the quadratic factor f 2 f 1 2 3 conclusions in this present work we analytically showed that when a frozen wave propagates through a two convex lens system the beam that emanates from the second lens is again a frozen wave which however suffered important alterations while its transverse spot size is scaled by the lens focal ratio f 2 f 1 its longitudinal pattern which can be chosen on demand is scaled by the quadratic factor f 2 f 1 2 the results here presented can be useful in the generation of structured light beams within very small spatial regions p s the co author e r thanks the brazilian fapesp for the pve fellowship no 2019 12329 3 4 references 1 m zamboni rached stationary optical
