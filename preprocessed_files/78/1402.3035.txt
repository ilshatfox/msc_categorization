abstract acceleration of electrically charged bodies is carried out by the electric field running via the spiral structure of the electric pulse the accelerated particles have a cylindrical shape with a diameter of cylinder dsh 2 mm a length of the conical part lcone 13 mm and the total length lsh 300 mm pre acceleration of the cylinder up to speed vin 1 km s is performed by gas dynamic the pulse with the voltage amplitude uacc 2 mv and the power p 300 mw goes into the spiral waveguide synchronously with the rod injected onto it the rod is accelerated by the traveling pulse in the longitudinal direction up to the finite velocity vfin 6 km s for length lacc 300 m introduction there is a known 1 method of magnetic dipole acceleration by sequential current turns which are switched on one by one creating the current pulse moving in the space magnetic dipoles in this process are accelerated by the magnetic field gradient in the space in principle using a large number of turns allows one to achieve a high finite speed of the magnetic dipoles such a multiple section accelerator consisting of a sequence of coils and capacitors can be considered as a line with the lumped parameters if you move from the line with lumped parameters to the line with distributed parameters you will obtain a casual coaxial cable which has the central wire rolled into a spiral or on a spiral waveguide in such a cable in a wide range of frequencies there is no dispersion i e there is no dependence of the phase velocity on the wave frequency the phase velocity in this cable coincides with the group velocity of the wave the wave propagation velocity pulse v in such a cable is defined by the tightness of winding of the central conductor in a spiral as well as by the dielectric properties of the medium which fills the cable this ratio is called the dispersion equation and looks as follows tg 1 2 1 v c v velocity of the pulse propagation via the cable 2 c 3 1010 cm s the speed of propagation of electromagnetic waves in the vacuum tg h 2 r 0 h the winding step of the spiral r 0 the radius of the spiral winding relative dielectric constant of the medium filling the cable the wave as if runs over the circle spiral around 2 r 0 while moving at a small distance h along the axis of the spiral further the wave additionally slows down due to the dielectric properties of the medium defined by the value of to speed up the rod by the pulse running in the cable the area inside the spiral must be released from the dielectric thus the speed of the pulse in this cable will be slightly increased 2 2 tg 1 2 2 running on the line with lumped or distributed parameters the pulse contains not only the gradient of the magnetic field which accelerates the magnetic dipoles but also the electric field ezw which can accelerate charged bodies 1 the parameters of the body being accelerated we will consider the acceleration of the rod with a conical head which is electrically charged acceleration of macro particles in a spiral waveguide is well known 2 for this acceleration it is required that the initial velocity of the rod and the phase velocity are approximately the same when we accelerate the rod the phase velocity in the spiral waveguide should be increased for the rod to be all the time in one the same phase of the wave which is called a synchronous phase to increase the phase velocity of the wave in the waveguide is possible by increasing the winding step of the spiral or decreasing its radius or doing the both simultaneously 2 let the diameter of the rod be equal to dsh 2 mm length lsh 300 mm then the cross section area of the rod is str dsh 2 4 3 14 10 2 cm 2 the volume of the rod vsh 1 cm 3 the weight of the rod in the case of the average density of the rod aver 5 g cm 3 is equal to msh 5 g 3 1 1 the ratio z a we assume the average atomic mass of the rod to be equal to ash 30 we find the number of nucleons in the rod from the following proportion 6 1023 30 g x 5 g where x 1023 atoms or ash 3 10 24 nucleons we take the surface tension of the electric field on the rod to be esurf 3 10 7 v cm the formula for the surface tension of the electric field for the cylinder is the following esurf 2 r 3 we find the charge density per the length unit of the rod esurf r 2 e 3 10 7 0 1 5 10 10 300 2 1013 4 from where you can find ne e lsh 3 10 14 5 thus if the put ne 3 10 14 electrons on the rod the surface tension of the field will turn out to be esurf 3 10 7 v cm now when we know the total number of the electrons placed on the rod ne 3 10 14 and the number of nucleons on it ash 3 10 24 it is possible to find the ratio of the charge to the mass for the rod z a ne a 3 1014 3 1024 10 10 1 2 irradiation of the rod with the electron beam to accelerate a cylindrical rod with a cone head in a spiral waveguide it is necessary to charge it electrically to give the electric charge to the rod is possible by irradiating it with the electron beam so that the electrons irradiating the rod would obligatory remain on it then the electric charge of the rod will increase proportionally to the current of the electron beam and the 4 duration of exposure of the rod suppose that the current of the electron beam irradiating the rod is equal to ibeam 5 a and the current pulse duration is beam 10 s then the total number of electrons in the current pulse is exactly equal to ne ibeam beam e 3 10 14 electrons 1 3 irradiation of the rod with the electron beam the electron energy let the cylindrical rod accelerated by the gas dynamic method up to speed vin 1 km s be irradiated with the electron beam obtained from an external source we assume the surface tension of the electric field to be equal to esurf 30 mv cm then for the diameter of the cylinder dsh 2 mm we find that the minimum energy of the electrons which can overcome the coulomb repulsion of the electrons previously placed on the rod should be we eesurf dsh 2 3 mev 1 4 irradiation of the rod with the electron beam the path length of the electrons in the rod electrons with the energy of 3 mev have the range path in aluminum approximately equal to 1 g cm 2 3 page 957 assuming the density of aluminum to be equal to al 2 7 g cm 3 we find that the extrapolated path of electrons in aluminum is lal 4 mm since the average density of the material chosen for the cylinder aver 5 g cm 3 that is by about twice more than the density of aluminum the path length of electrons of the energy of 3 mev in the rod will be approximately equal to 2 mm evidently it is necessary to gradually increase the energy of the electrons in the process of irradiation it is needed that while setting the electrons on the rod the electrons emitted later on the one hand would have a sufficiently high energy to overcome the coulomb repulsion of the electrons being already on the rod and on the other hand the electron energy must not be too high because it is necessary to have the length of the electron path in the material of the rod to be much less than its diameter in this energy range the length of the electron passing in the rod material linearly increases with the energy for example of the electrons with energies we 300 kev having the length of electron passing equal to 0 2 mm they cannot cross the rod diameter of 2 mm they will lose their energy for ionization of the matter and will be placed on the rod 5 1 5 irradiation of the rod with the electron beam field electron emission to plant several charges on the rod is not a problem but when there are many electrons on the rod they will start to leak out from it due to the field emission let the field strength for the field emission be esurf 3 10 7 v cm when there are enough planted electrons on the rod to plant the next portion it is necessary to overcome the repulsion of those electrons which are already sitting there this means that the energy of the electrons which we would like to put on the rod should be large enough so that they can overcome this coulomb barrier reach the rod and stay on it planting a large electric charge would be interfered by the field emission a part of the charge due to the tunnel effect will continuously leak out from the rod 1 6 surface covering with platinum and oxygen passivation of the cylinder to create a surface barrier for the electrons having placed on the rod it is needed to increase the energy yield of the electrons from the rod the largest energy yield belongs to platinum passivated by oxygen e 6 56 ev 3 page 445 planted on the rod the charge will leak out from it by the field emission according to the formula 3 page 444 j e 2 e 2 8 h exp 8 3 2 m 1 2 h e 3 2 ee y 6 where y is the nordheim function the argument of this function is a relative reduction of the energy yield by the external electric field according to schottky s law 1 7 leakage of electrons let us find the number of electrons which will leave the rod during acceleration for the field tension e 30 mv cm and the energy yield e 6 5 ev from the graph 3 page 461 we find that the leakage current density is j 10 9 a cm 2 leakage of charge q will be q j ssurf tacc 7 6 where j 10 9 a cm 2 leakage density current ssurf 20 cm 2 the total surface of the rod the acceleration can be determined from the following formula tacc lacc vaver 8 where lacc 300 m length of acceleration vaver 3 km s the average speed over the length of the acceleration calculating the time of the acceleration from formula 8 we find it to be equal to tacc 0 1 s substituting numbers into the formula 7 we find that ne 10 10 electrons and it is 3 10 5 the number of electrons which were planted on the rod 2 the acceleration length the acceleration rate of the charge in the electric field can be written as follows w z a eezw 9 and for the tension of the wave ezw 70 kv cm the rate of the energy gain will be w 7 10 4 ev m nucleon so that the required increase of energy wfin 0 2 ev nucleon will be reached on the length lacc wfin w 300 m 10 3 selection of parameters of the spiral waveguide the initial velocity of the rod in a spiral sh in expressed in terms of the velocity of light sh in vsh in c where c 3 10 10 cm s the velocity of light in vacuum is equal to sh in 3 3 10 6 finite sh fin 2 10 5 the spiral is assumed to consist of several sections so that within each section to select the optimal acceleration rate the wavelength of the acceleration can be determined from the condition x 2 r 0 ph 0 1 where x a dimensionless parameter which is the argument of the modified bessel functions r 0 the radius of the spiral ph phase velocity 0 wavelength acceleration in the vacuum 0 c f 0 f 0 acceleration frequency 7 choosing the initial radius r 0 in the spiral equal to r 0 in 20 cm 1280 the dielectric constant of the medium located in the area between the coil and the screen we find 0 3 8 10 7 cm f 0 790 hz thus the slowdown wavelength for the start of acceleration is equal to slow 0 1 25 m 3 1 parameters of the spiral in order to obtain the required field intensity e 0 in a spiral waveguide it is required to introduce the power defined by the formula 2 p c 8 e 0 2 r 0 2 ph 11 where p the high frequency power introduced into the spiral waveguide r 0 the radius of the spiral ph phase velocity of the wave which is determined from the dispersion equation the curly bracket in 11 is equal to 1 i 0 k 1 i 1 k 0 i 1 2 i 0 i 2 i 0 k 0 2 1 i 1 k 0 i 0 k 1 k 0 k 2 k 1 2 12 where i 0 i 1 i 2 are the modified bessel functions of the first kind k 0 k 1 k 2 the modified bessel functions of the second kind the first term in the curly bracket corresponds to the flux propagating inside the spiral the second term corresponds to the flux traveling outside the spiral since the space between the spiral and the screen is filled with a dielectric before it there is the second term factor 2 in this case to slow down the electromagnetic wave till the velocity of sound it is required to use geometrical properties of the structure spiral small step as well as the properties of the medium that is why we have chosen the relative permittivity 1280 thus the flow of high frequency power propagating outside the spiral is more than 103 times greater than the power propagating inside the spiral therefore the first term inside the curly bracket can be neglected compared to the second one the very meaning of the bracket for the argument x 1 is approximately equal to 4 in accelerators the synchronous phase is selected on the front slope of the pulse so that the electric field accelerating the particle is always less than the amplitude value let us choose a synchronous phase to be equal to s 45 0 8 sin s 0 7 ezw e 0 sin s thus the amplitude of the wave which accelerates the cylindrical rod should be equal to the following e 0 ezw sin s 100 kv cm 13 then the wave power expressed by the formula 11 in watts is equal to p w 3 1010 1010 4 102 3 3 10 6 1 28 103 4 8 9 104 107 300 mw 14 3 2 the transition from a sine wave to a single pulse this power can be achieved by using the pulse technique we expand the sinusoidal pulse 2 the corresponding half wave epulse e 0 pulsesin 2 t 0 t 2 t 0 0 0 2 f 0 in a fourier series t 0 2 f 1 2 1 2 sin 0 t sin tdt 15 0 the pulse spectrum is narrow and covers the frequency range from 0 to 2 0 since the spiral waveguide dispersion dependence of the phase velocity on the frequency is weak it can be expected that the full range of frequencies from 0 to 2 0 will propagate approximately with the same phase velocity as a result the half wave sinusoidal pulse will spread out in the space and becomes wider by several times only due to the increase of the phase velocity of the wave in this case the spiral waveguide is necessary to match with a supply feeder in the following frequency range f 0 2 we introduce the concept of pulse amplitude associated with the field tension at the axis of the spiral e 0 by the following ratio 2 pulse e 0 pulse slow 2 slow 0 0 c f 0 16 selection of wavelength 0 3 8 10 7 cm means that we have chosen the duration of the acceleration of the rod equal to f 0 c 0 790 hz pulse 1 2 f 0 630 s the amplitude of the voltage pulse will be equal to e 0 slow 2 2 mv table 1 summarizes the main parameters of the accelerator 9 table 1 the parameters of the accelerator z a 10 10 insulator outside the spiral wave power p p 300

accelerator lacc lacc 300 m pulse duration 630 s amplitude of voltage 2 mv 3 3 the capture of particles in the acceleration mode admission we calculate the required accuracy to match the initial phase of the accelerating wave pulse with a synchronous phase the theory of particle capture in a traveling wave gives 3 s s 2 s 4 in our case it means the following t 0 4 correspond to the duration of 316 s or 90 0 degrees and a one degree phase corresponds to the time interval of approximately 3 s in linear accelerators the buncher gives the phase width of the bunch 150 to avoid large phase oscillations it is required that the timing accuracy of synchronization of the rod with the accelerating pulse would be equal to 15 3 s 45 s this timing precision seems to be quite achievable for the gunpowder start which is a preliminary gas dynamic acceleration of the rod now let us calculate the required accuracy of the coincidence of the wave phase velocity with the initial rate of the rod we introduce value g p ps ps the relative difference between the pulses 4 in the non relativistic case it is just the relative velocity dispersion of g v vs vs the vertical scale of the separatrix is calculated by the following formula 4 gmax 2 w ctg s 2 s 1 s ctg s 1 2 17 wherein s 45 0 4 ctg s 1 1 s ctg s 1 2 0 46 2 0 46 0 9 w z a ee 0 0 sin s mc 2 let us determine the value of w z a ee 0 0 sin s mc 2 which is the relative set rod energy at wavelength 0 in vacuum in our case 10 0 c f 0 3 8 10 7 cm sin s 0 7 mc 2 1 gev w 2 66 10 6 substituting numerical values we get g vin vs vs v vs and finally v vs 2 66 10 6 6 28 3 3 10 6 1 2 0 9 0 11 thus the accessible mismatch of the rod initial velocity with the pulse velocity is of the order of v vs 11 for the initial rate of the rod vin 1 km s the mismatch accuracy of the velocity deviation is v 100 m s 4 radial movement it is well known 4 that in the azimuthal symmetric wave the phase stability region corresponds to the radial defocusing in this case you cannot simultaneously obtain both the radial and phase stabilities under the conditions of phase stability for radial focusing it is required to use the external field in this phase region the radial component of the electric field of the wave is directed to the increasing radius i e it radially accelerates the rod in this velocity region of the rods the hypersonic velocity region where they are by hundreds of thousand times smaller than the speed of light the focusing by magnetic quadrupole lenses is not efficient in this case the most suitable focusing is by using the electrostatic quadrupole lenses these lenses focus the particles in one plane and defocus them in the other one collected into a doublet two lenses of this sort give the focusing effect the accelerator is divided into separate sections and the focusing doublets are placed between the accelerator sections 11 5 operation of the device fig 1 shows a diagram of the apparatus fig 1 the
