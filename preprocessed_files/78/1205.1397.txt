pulses in the normal dis persion regime has been largely studied in recent years since it is a key consideration in order to achieve high energy pulses from ytterbium doped fiber laser systems it is now well known that high intensity pulse propaga tion in an optical fiber with normal group velocity disper sion gvd is subject to the optical wave breaking insta bility the effects of this instability are known to be alle viated by the use of a parabolic pulse profile 1 this idea has been successfully extended to amplifiers with normal gvd by introducing the self similarity concept 2 3 it has been shown that the nonlinear schro dinger nls equation with gain admits of a self similar parabolic solu tion or similariton characterized by a parabolic tempo ral intensity profile with a linear chirp the field distribu tion and the pulse spectrum evolve self similarly during amplification making pulse compression feasible even at high power since similaritons are asymptotic solutions to the nls equation with gain any arbitrary input pulse will even tually evolve towards the parabolic pulse propagation regime however in practice many constraints need to be fulfilled by the amplifier and the seed pulses in or der to reach the parabolic regime in a finite length of amplifier it has also been demonstrated that the effec tiveness of the self similar regime is inherently limited by the raman response of the fiber material and the finite bandwidth of the amplifier 4 5 therefore in order to obtain the shortest pulses with the largest peak power the length of the amplifier must be kept below a critical value this constraint could be relaxed if one could de sign an amplifier with a larger value of normal gvd one potential avenue to increase the effective gvd would consist in propagating the pulses through a fiber bragg grating outside its photonic bandgap in such a case one could expect to mimic the classical parabolic pulse am plification regime with a much higher value of gvd in this letter we present the results of a numerical investigation of pulse amplification in nonlinear fiber bragg gratings nlfbg with gain the pulses ampli fied in such media termed bragg similaritons bs have been found to share common properties with classical similaritons generated in standard optical fibers with gain we will also show that the amplified pulses are sensitive to the large value of the third order dispersion tod induced by the fiber bragg gratings however our numerical simulations reveal that the fourth order dispersion fod also present alleviates the effects of tod which normally leads to a shock wave type of in stability the propagation of an optical pulse in an nlfbg with gain can be described by the following pair of equations i uf z i vg uf t z uf z ub uf 2 2 ub 2 uf ig 2 uf 0 1 i ub z i vg ub t z ub z uf ub 2 2 uf 2 ub ig 2 ub 0 2 where uf and ub represent the field envelopes of the electric field distributions corresponding to the for ward and backward propagating waves vg represents the group velocity in the absence of the grating is the nonlinear coefficient z and z are the coupling and detuning coefficients of the grating the constant g rep resents the uniform small signal gain of the amplifier in an nlfbg without gain or losses when the peak power of the pulse p 0 is low enough to meet the condition p 0 and the tod induced by the grating g 3 is negligible we can reduce eqs 1 2 to a single effective nls equation if we consider the evolution of the pulse in an nlfbg amplifier in the absence of gain saturation and for pulses with spectral bandwidth less then the am plifier bandwidth the pulse evolution can be described by an effective nls equation with gain nlsg 7 i u z g 2 2 2 u t g u 2 u i g 2 u 0 3 1 http arxiv org abs 1205 1397 v 1 where g 2 and g are the effective gvd and the ef fective nonlinear parameter of the grating g the gain coefficient and u is the bloch wave envelope since we know from previous analyses that the parabolic simi lariton is solution to this equation we could expect the pulse evolution in nlfbgs with gain to share common properties with classical similaritons the term bragg similariton refers specifically to the self similar solution of this effective nlsg equation in order to get a substantial increase of the effective gvd in an nlfbg operated in transmission we need to propagate the pulse at a frequency very close to the photonic bandgap and or use a grating with a very large index variation in such cases the effect of tod cannot be neglected anymore and we have to evaluate how the bs is affected by higher order dispersion fig 1 shows the different dispersion coefficients for nlfbgs used in transmission in these conditions the gvd parameter g 2 is many orders of magnitude higher than that of a classical fiber but its tod g 3 is also very high it is now well known that the presence of tod or more precisely a large 3 2 ratio has a detrimental effect on the self similar regime 8 9 hense we have to minimize this ratio in order to generate a bs we can also take note that the effect of tod will be minimized for a narrow pulse spectrum the fourth order dispersion g 4 is also non negligible and as we will see it has a significant effect on pulse propagation near the bandgap fig 1 dispersion coefficients for an nlfbg in trans mission near the bandgap for three different values of index modulation n 10 2 blue n 5 0 10 2 green and n 10 3 red following the notation of bale et al 8 we character ized the effect of the higher order dispersion coefficients on the propagated pulses in the nlfgb with the skew parameter which quantifies the asymmetry of the pulse temporal shape s a 2 3 d 4 fig 2 evolution of the skew parameter and parabolic misfit with detuning for an input gaussian pulse of 1 0 blue 3 5 green and 6 0 nj red where is a normalized time variable and a the nor malized amplitude the skew parameter has been com puted for different values of detuning by propagating a 5 0 ps gaussian pulse over a distance of 1 m with a clas sical split step fourier ssf algorithm with the corre sponding higher order dispersion n 5 and the follow ing nlfbg parameters n 1 0 10 2 g 29 db m 54 km 1 w 1 the misfit parameter between the pulse intensity profile u 2 and the parabolic fit ufit 2 has also been computed for the same conditions 2 i u 2 ufit 2 2 dt u 4 dt 5 fig 2 shows the skew and the misfit parameters 2 i for various values of detuning and initial pulse energy interestingly if we are assuming that these two param eters are good indicators of the departure of the pulse from the classical similariton this departure increases with detuning even if the g 3 g 2 ratio is decreasing in the present case the optimal detuning for the formation of a similariton like pulse is between 6 8 nm the gray region in the upper graph of fig 2 shows the condi tion for which a shock wave type of instability normally starts to develop s 0 06 in the absence of fod however in the present case the large value of fod in hibits the formation of instabilities even in the case of a strongly distorted pulse fig 3 shows some examples of classical similaritons distorted by tod with differ ent skew parameters with and without fod the pulse has been propagated over four values of distance with a classical ssf algorithm using the dispersion parameters g 2 24 7 ps 2 m and g 3 4 5 ps 3 m we can clearly see the onset of wave breaking on the left side of the pulse propagating without fod when for the same con ditions the pulse propagating with g 4 1 1 ps 4 m is immune to this kind of instability considering the optimal conditions previously found we simulated pulse propagation in an nlfbg with gain 2 fig 3 effect of fourth order dispersion on the wave breaking on an asymmetric pulse for different values of skew parameter s 0 05 a s 0 06 b s 0 07 c and s 0 13 d with blue and without fod green by solving numerically eqs 1 2 to all orders of dis persion with the optimized split step method ossm described in 10 the nlfbg used in these simulations has a length of 1 m a constant gain coefficient g 29 db m a coupling constant 24 5 cm 1 and a detun ing constant 60 5 cm 1 the dispersion coefficients are given by g 2 83 4 ps 2 m g 3 23 9 ps 3 m and g 4 9 8 ps 4 m the effective refractive index in the absence of the grating was equal to n 1 45 and the non linear coefficient equal to 54 km 1 w 1 the input gaussian pulse has a temporal width of 5 0 ps and a peak power of 1 13 kw in order to compare the results with propagation in a simple medium the simulations have also been repeated with the classical ssf algorithm with the corresponding dispersion and nonlinear coefficients fig 4 shows the temporal pulse characteristics on lin ear and logarithmic scales from both methods since the ossm is a temporal method and the group velocity in the nlfbg is changing with detuning the three tem poral profiles are identified by their propagation time the profiles obtained with the ossm and the classical ssf algorithm are very similar we can suppose that the minor differences between the two curves originate from the cumulative effects of the higher order disper sion coefficients n 4 which were left out in the ssf simulations more interestingly the pulses share many properties with classical similaritons the central part of the pulse evolves from a gaussian profile to a slightly skewed parabolic shape when plotted on a logarithmic scale the intensity profile presents abruptly decreasing wings typical of compact parabolic similaritons the in tensity profile also presents exponentially decaying low intensity wings typical of the intermediate asymptotic regime of similaritons finally the chirp in the high in tensity region of the pulse exhibits an excellent linearity in summary we have numerically investigated the op timal condition for the amplification of a pulse in an nlfbg with gain in the normal dispersion regime the stabilizing effet of fod on the similariton propagation in the presence of tod has been demonstrated finally we have shown that pulses amplified in an nlfbg share common properties with classical similaritons generated in standard optical fibers with gain this solution could open the possibility of parabolic amplification at wave lengths usually confined into the anomalous dispersion regime such as er doped fiber amplifiers this work was supported by the canadian institute for photonic innovations and national sciences and en gineering research council of
