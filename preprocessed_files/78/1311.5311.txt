institute for nuclear research joliot curie str 6 dubna russia 141980 the acceleration of lithium tube segments with the length ls 1 cm diameter ds 16 wall thickness s 1 nm up to the energy wfin 1 mev nucl is considered these segments are electrically charged up to the surface field strength es 10 9 v cm by proton beams produced by an electron beam source which results in a charge to mass ratio z a 1 6 10 2 then they are accelerated by the traveling wave field in a spiral waveguide at the length of acceleration lacc 30 m the segments are next sent to a frozen d t target where they are compressed by three hundred times in the longitudinal direction while compressing the d t target radially by 104 times thus the conditions for thermonuclear fusion are realized 1 introduction a prerequisite of thermonuclear burning in a reactor with inertial confinement fusion icf is the target compression by a power flux from external radiation sources this is done in order to increase by thousands times the reaction yield y nlt where is the reaction cross section n is the density of the target atoms lt is the interaction length which is about the target size while compressing a spherical target its density increases as 1 r 3 and the interaction length decreases as r so that the product nlt may grow significantly and the yield will increase from the normal for nuclear reactions values y 10 4 to the value y 1 as the thermonuclear fuel is burned completely the well known schemes of compression by laser radiation and light ion beams do not allow under focusing conditions compression of targets with a characteristic transverse dimension of several microns however no such limitation exists for the compression of targets by macro particles accelerated to energies above the threshold of nuclear reactions this study examines the acceleration of macro particles in a spiral waveguide and processes occuring as they hit a d t target 2 the parameters of an accelerated particle let us consider a macro particle representing a thin wall lithium tube section namely a tube segment with the diameter ds 16 wall thickness s 10 7 cm 1 nm and length ls 1 cm the mass of the tube section is 2 ms li ds s ls 2 6 10 10 g where the density of lithium is taken to be li 0 53 g cm 3 we find from avogadro s ratio that the number of atoms per cubic centimeter of lithium is 4 5 1022 atoms a tube segment with the specified parameters contains nli 2 25 10 13 atoms of lithium or approximately a 1 6 1014 nucleons when irradiating such a macro particle by an ion beam it can be electrically charged up to the surface field strength es 10 9 v cm to be specific we will refer here to a proton beam the density of the field electron emission current is j a cm 2 10 4 for the surface barrier e 2 38 ev electronic work function for lithium 1 p 444 and the surface field intensity es 10 mv cm 1 p 461 let us assume that the surface intensity of the electric field on a tube segment is es 10 9 v cm and the density of the leakage current of positive charges from the tube section equals j 10 4 a cm 2 the charge density located on the cylindrical surface is related to the surface intensity of the field es by the relationship es 4 ds 1 does not depend on the cylindrical surface length and is determined only by its diameter we find from 1 that at the surface field strength es 10 9 v cm one centimeter of the tube section length contains np 2 6 10 12 uncompensated protons let us calculate the ratio of charge per nucleon in such a cylinder to do so we divide the total number of excess protons np 2 6 10 12 placed on a tube segment by the total number of nucleons contained in this segment a 1 6 1014 we obtain that this ratio np a 1 6 10 2 which roughly corresponds to a fourfold ionized ion of uranium 238 4 238 1 7 10 2 the energy of ions irradiating the macro particle should vary from the primary equal to units of electron volts to the end one 3 e es ds 800 kev a short explanation should be given as to how such a lithium thin wall tube segment can be made it can be produced by spraying a few layers of lithium 10 angstroms 1 nm onto the inner surface of any tube shaped shell for instance from an organic material obviously before such a tube segment is further irradiated to provide its positive charge this shell should be removed for instance through evaporation under laser irradiation the head and tail parts of the tube section should be closed with lithium hemispheres of the same wall thickness with the result that it must have the shape of a vessel operating under pressure this segment of thin wall lithium tube with closed hemispheres of the head and tail parts is in fact a lithium bubble 3 acceleration of particles we consider the acceleration of macro particles which can be carried out according to the usual scheme preliminary electrostatic acceleration up to a speed that approximately coincides with the phase velocity of the wave in a slowing structure and final acceleration in the traveling wave field 3 1 static field acceleration let us assume that the voltage under which the platform with the container comprising tube segments is kept equals u 800 kv then after electrostatic acceleration the relative speed of the segment v c expressed in terms of the speed of light in vacuum c 3 x 1010 cm s will be 2 e z a u mc 2 1 2 2 where mc 2 1 gev is the rest mass of the nucleon expressed in units of electron volt z a 1 6 10 2 is the electric charge per nucleon and e is the unit charge substituting the numbers into formula 2 we find that the speed of macro particles after preliminary acceleration equals 5 10 3 the initial velocity in of the wave traveling in a slowing structure a wave whose longitudinal electric field component is bound to accelerate macro particles should be the same 4 3 2 electromagnetic acceleration 3 2 1 the parameters of a spiral waveguide we choose a spiral waveguide as an accelerating structure for the acceleration of macro particles 2 for a spiral waveguide with the spiral winding radius r 0 1 cm the relationship between the winding pitch and phase velocity therein can be obtained 2 tg 1 2 3 where tg h 2 r 0 is the tangent of the winding angle h is the spiral pitch 2 r 0 is the turn perimeter is the dielectric permittivity factor of the medium filling the space between the spiral and the outer shield let us take water as a filler of the space between the spiral and the outer shield 80 1 2 9 then for the spiral radius r 0 1 cm and the initial velocity of the wave in the slowing structure in 5 10 3 we find from relation 3 that hin 0 28 cm in a spiral waves of different frequencies propagate with the same deceleration but there is a frequency f 0 for which the maximum strength of the longitudinal field ez can be achieved at a given flow rate this frequency may be determined from the formula 2 r 0 0 1 4 where 0 c f 0 is the vacuum wavelength from 4 we find the optimal wavelength of acceleration for the beginning of the accelerator 0 in 12 5 m the corresponding frequency f 0 in c 0 in 24 mhz we now choose an end point energy up to which such lithium macro particles will be accelerated wfin 1 mev nucl let us assume that the voltage to accelerate a micro particle e 0 sin s 20 kv cm where e 0 30 kv cm is the field amplitude s 45 0 is the synchronous phase sin s 0 7 5 knowing the effective charge of a macro particle z a 1 6 10 2 and intensity of the accelerating field e 0 sin s 20 kv cm you can find the accelerator length lacc 2 from the relationship wfin z a e e 0 sin s lacc 2 5 hence lacc 2 wfin z a e e 0 sin s 30 m such a large accelerator length is due to the fact that the amount of charge per nucleon has a very low value for a macro particle z a 1 6 10 2 while being approximately z a for light ions and for protons equal to unity 3 2 2 power consumption we shall find the power required to create in a spiral waveguide the field strength e 0 30 kv cm for the start of the accelerator from the relationship 2 pin c 8 e 0 2 r 0 2 in 1 i 0 k 1 i 1 k 0 i 1 2 i 0 i 2 i 0 k 0 2 1 i 1 k 0 i 0 k 1 k 0 k 2 k 1 2 6 where i 0 i 1 i 2 are modified bessel functions of the first kind and k 0 k 1 k 2 are modified bessel functions of the second kind the first term in the curly brackets corresponds to the flux propagating inside the spiral while the second term to the flux traveling between the spiral and external shield the latter area is filled with a medium having a dielectric constant therefore the second summand contains a factor the bessel functions in 6 are dependent on the argument x 2 r 0 0 where the spiral is most effective x 1 the first term in the curly brackets is equal to unity and the second term to 4 in our case 80 the first term can be neglected and substituting the numbers into formula 6 we obtain pin 3 10 10 9 108 5 10 3 4 80 8 9 104 107 6 mw let us determine the required power for the end of the accelerator assuming 6 that the same spiral radius r 0 1 cm is taken since the phase velocity has increased by two orders towards the end of the accelerator there is no water filling of the space between the spiral and the outer shield then the power pfin equals pfin 3 10 10 9 108 4 5 10 2 4 8 9 104 107 675 kw we can see that obtaining such power for the pulsed operation of radio frequency generators will not be a problem the required high frequency power at the accelerator s beginning is greater compared to its end which is due to the use of a dielectric between the spiral and outer shield according to formula 6 only 0 3 of high frequency power propagates along the spiral axis where the lithium tube segments are accelerated this use of the dielectric is explained by the necessity to increase the spiral pitch at the beginning of the accelerator let us find the spiral pitch hfin at the end of the accelerator from the relation fin hfin 2 r 0 substituting r 0 1 cm and hfin 2 8 mm we obtain fin 4 5 10 2 3 2 3 the capture of macro particles into the acceleration mode tolerances we calculate now the accuracy which is required for the initial phase of the accelerating wave to coincide with the synchronous phase the theory of particle capture by a traveling wave shows 3 3 s s 2 s in our case the quarter period 1 4 f 0 t 0 4 corresponds to 10 ns or 90 0 hence one degree in phase corresponds to a time interval of about 0 1 ns a buncher in a linear accelerator provides a bunch phase width of 150 in order to avoid large phase fluctuations the accuracy of synchronization between the macro particle and accelerating wave should be 15 0 1 ns 1 5 ns such timing accuracy is apparently quite achievable let us calculate the tolerance for the accuracy of matching the initial speed of a macro particle and phase velocity of the pulse propagating along the spiral structure we introduce the value g p ps ps which is a relative difference in pulses 3 in a non relativistic case this corresponds to a relative velocity spread g v vs vs the vertical spread of the separatrix is calculated by the formula 3 7 gmax 2 w ctg s 2 s 1 s ctg s 1 2 7 where s 45 0 4 ctg s 1 1 s ctg s 1 2 0 46 2 0 46 0 9 w z a ee 0 0 sin s mc 2 further we determine the value w z a ee 0 0 sin s mc 2 which is a relative energy gain by a macro particle at the wavelength 0 in vacuum in our case 0 c f 0 12 5 m sin s 0 7 mc 2 1 gev w 4 10 4 substituting numerical values we obtain that g vin vs vs v vs and finally v vs 4 10 4 6 28 5 10 3 1 2 0 9 0 1 thus the admissible discrepancy between the initial speed of the macro particle and the wave velocity is of the order v vs 10 3 2 4 the heating of the spiral in the above we have found high frequency power losses associated with attenuation these losses are spent for heating of the spiral and in order to prevent changing of its electromagnetic characteristics and melting the spiral needs to be cooled this can be done with water which acts as a medium with a large dielectric constant and is located between the spiral and external shield at the end of the accelerator where there is no such medium cooling needs to be done by gas such as helium 3 2 5 radial movement as is well known 3 in azimuth symmetric waves the phase stability or autophasing region is characterized by radial defocusing therefore you cannot obtain radial and phase stability in such waves concurrently however when the phase stability is achieved radial stability can be provided as well by introducing external fields in this phase region the radial component of the electric field of the wave is directed towards radius increase accelerating thus the particles in the direction away from the axis of acceleration let us consider focusing of accelerated lithium tube segments using quadrupole lenses it is known 3 that quadrupole lenses simultaneously provide focusing of particles in one plane and defocusing in another if two lenses are used so that they are turned relative to each other through 900 then 8 focusing and defocusing areas will be generated alternately in each of the transverse planes under certain conditions such a system of lenses appears to be focusing one the doublets are usually placed between adjacent sections being turned through 900 in fact a particle moving accurately along the axis is not acted on by any forces the further away the particle is from the axis the greater is the action of the forces let the particle hit the focusing area its trajectory will bend then in such a way as to cross the defocusing area at the minimal value of the field and the focusing forces will prove to be greater than defocusing ones a similar effect also arises if the particle passes the defocusing area first the resulting effect from a pair of quadrupole lenses will be collecting 3 the focusing and defocusing effects of the lenses are determined by their rigidity k z a egll 2 mc 2 z 8 where z a is the ratio of charge to mass g is the gradient of the electric or magnetic field in the lens ll is the length of the lens mc 2 1 gev corresponds to the rest mass of the nucleon z is the longitudinal particle velocity expressed in terms of the speed of light rigidity among these notations is a dimensionless quantity in contrast to a pair of quadrupole lenses the accelerating section operates as a defocusing lens in both perpendicular directions around the acceleration axis where there is no electric volume charge the following condition is realized div e 0 9 from whence follows the ratio between the longitudinal and transverse electric fields er r 2 dez dz 10 which is apparent however from the structure of the field in the spiral waveguide 2 9 by analogy with quadrupole lenses we can introduce for the accelerating field the concept of the field gradient gs dez dz e 0 s where e 0 designates the amplitude of the accelerating field s is the length of the slow wave in the structure let us consider now the focusing by electrostatic quadrupole lenses we require that the rigidity of the quadrupole lens be greater than the rigidity of the accelerating section which means that the particle deflection angle in the lens must be greater than the deflection angle in the section in the accelerating section the angle of particle deflection is always directed outwards and defocusing of the accelerated particles occurs in both transverse planes the particles passing through the quadrupole lens are deflected inwards while being deflected outwards in a different plane 2 this means that the gradient of the field in the lens multiplied by the square of its length must be greater than the gradient of the field in the accelerating section also multiplied by the square of its length gl ll 2 gs ls 2 11 the most difficult conditions in terms of focusing are found at the beginning of the accelerator let the length of the lens make up one third of the section length that is ls 2 ll 2 10 ls 3 ll then the electric field gradient in the electrostatic lenses must exceed at least by ten times the electric field gradient in the sections i e gl 10 gs 12 substituting the numbers for the start of acceleration where s 6 28 cm we find that the electric field gradient in the electrostatic lenses must be greater than gl 1 5 10 5 v cm 2 such high gradients in electrostatic quadrupole lenses are the payment for the high and continuous for a traveling wave in lengthy sections rate of acceleration if such field gradients in the lenses are difficult enough to obtain you will need to move to a lower rate of acceleration it needs to be added that such deceleration rates as in 5 10 3 can be easily achieved in accelerators with an azimuthally asymmetric accelerating field the 10 so called rfq radio frequency quadrupole accelerators where focusing is performed by the accelerating field and no other focusing elements are necessary 4 the power transmitted to the beam we have calculated the rf power of generators needed to generate an electric field of intensity e 0 30 kv cm in a spiral waveguide let us now estimate the power transferred to the beam each macro particle contains nli 2 25 10 13 lithium atoms with the energy wli 7 mev multiplying these figures we find the energy of a macro particle in electron volts and dividing the resulting expression by 6 24 1018 we obtain the energy of a macro particle in joules li 25 j during the pulse operation of high frequency generators the number of such particles in the wavetrain is 2 103 at the pulse duration pulse 100 s so that the power delivered to the beam from a generator is found to be pbeam 500 mw which indicates that the high frequency power of the generators must be increased by about 100 times at the beginning of the accelerator it can be seen that the energy transferred to the beam is significantly greater than the energy expended on the generation of the accelerating field if high frequency energy is recuperated the efficiency of the accelerator can be raised even higher such power transmitted to the beam pbeam 500 mw is too great for the modern high frequency generators standing wave linear i e rfq accelerators can be operated using stored energy in order to reduce the power transmitted to the beam up to 5 mw a lithium tube segment needs to be placed into every hundredth separatrix in traveling wave linear accelerators the acceleration of particles can be provided by a faster running powerful single pulse instead of a high frequency wave 2 which ensures a corresponding growth of power let us analyze the sine shaped pulse with the help of the fourier integral 0 sin 2 t 0 t where 2 t 0 0 0 2 f 0 we obtain 11 t 0 2 f 1 2 1 2 sin 0 t sin tdt 13 0 the pulse spectrum is narrow and occupies a frequency range from 0 to 2 0 the dispersion dependence of the phase velocity on the frequency in a spiral waveguide is weak and the waves within this frequency range are expected to propagate with the same phase velocity as a result the half wave sinusoidal pulse will spread out in space due to increasing phase velocity of the wave matching the spiral waveguide with the supply system must be implemented in this case in the frequency range f 0 2 we introduce the concept of pulse amplitude uacc associated with the field on the spiral axis e 0 pulse using relation 2 uacc e 0 pulse slow 2 slow 0 0 c f 0 14 as a result the amplitude of the voltage pulse propagating along the spiral axis is as follows uacc e 0 pulse slow 2 30 kv the amplitude of the current pulse iacc p uacc 17 ka the impedance line line uacc iacc 2 ohms such a low resistance can be obtained in an artificial transmission line with lumped parameters where the spiral winding appears as a distributed inductance 640 nh cm the winding must be respectively capacity loaded 160 nf cm thus we have obtained a multi section coil gun the difference between ours and the known samples is that we are dealing with the acceleration of particles having characteristic transverse dimensions of the order of several microns furthermore we have chosen the particles in the form of a bubble where the entire mass is concentrated near the surface and to reduce the field emission we have charged the bubble with positive particles as is known the field ion emission arises when the field intensity begins to significantly exceed the field electron emission this allows one to increase the charge to mass ratio of the particles and accelerate them to the energy above the threshold of nuclear reactions at a length of some tens of meters 12 table of parameters the accelerated lithium tube segment

lenses 8 deuterium tritium target 5 thermonuclear reactions let us consider nuclear reactions which are to occur when such a lithium bubble will hit for example a deuterium tritium target the density of liquid hydrogen at the temperature 260 0 c is 0 076 g cm 3 the density of deuterium is twofold higher and of tritium three times greater 1 p 57 a mixture of deuterium and tritium 50 to 50 will have a molecular weight of 5 g and density approximately equal to 0 2 g cm 3 we find the number of molecules contained in one cubic centimeter from avogadro s relationship whence one cubic centimeter contains 2 4 1022 molecules or about 5 1022 atoms next we find the depth of the path of lithium nuclei with an energy of 1 mev nucleon in a deuterium tritium mixture the stopping power of protons in the air at an energy of protons 1 mev is equal to dw dx 150 mev cm 2 g 1 p 953 14 in most of the path the losses are equal to dw dx 600 mev cm 2 g the stopping power of hydrogen in air is about two and a half times greater 1 p 953 and fully ionized due to stripping lithium ions will have the same path as protons altogether one can assume that the stopping power of the deuterium tritium mixture for fully ionized lithium ions equals dw dx 1 5 gev cm 2 g multiplying the stopping power by the density of the mixture we obtain the energy losses through ionization dw dx 300 mev cm and the range of the lithium ions lfr wfin dw dx lfr 30 we now find the number of atoms inside the volume bounded by the diameter of the lithium bubble ds 16 and by the length of the stopping path of lithium ions in a deuterium tritium target lfr 30 the volume occupied by this tube segment is vb rs 2 lfr 6 10 9 cm 3 and contains n d t 3 10 14 atoms next we find the total energy introduced by the bubble without the energy released by nuclear reactions as well as taking into account that only half of the energy released goes inside wtotal 7 mev 2 25 10 13 7 8 1019 ev dividing this energy by the total number of atoms in the volume bounded by the cylinder diameter ds 16 and by the length equal to the depth of cylinder penetration into the deuterium tritium mixture lfr 30 n d t 3 10 14 we determine that for each atom of the mixture there is approximately 260 kev energy the optimal energy near which the reaction yield is maximal equals 107 kev the corresponding cross section being 5 barns 1 p 899 let the reaction yield y be equal to the value y nlt where is the reaction cross section n is the density of the target atoms lt is the mean path of the incident nucleus in the target the yield is the probability of a nuclear reaction per one incident nucleus we take the cross section of the reaction d t he n equal to 2 barns then for the probability of the reaction y to be equal to y 1 it is required that the product nlt be equal to nlt 5 10 23 in our case the density of the target atoms n d t 5 10 22 and the yield probability is unity at the interaction length lt 10 cm it can be seen that the interaction length in this case is lt 10 that is four orders are lacking for the reaction yield to be 100 15 if the interaction of a lithium tube with the d t target results in a radial compression of the target by 104 times then the density will rise by 8 orders of magnitude the interaction length will reduce by 4 orders and the product nlt will reach the value nlt 5 10 23 the speed of the mixture deuterons at the energy wd 260 kev per one deuteron is d vd c 2 wd mc 2 1 2 for the deuteron d 2 3 10 2 and vd 7 10 8 cm s the transverse dimension of the mixture after the compression by 104 times is lt 10 7 cm so the lifetime of plasma in a compressed state can be considered equal to lt vd 1 4 10 16 s the initial density of the mixture nin 5 10 22 after a radial compression by 104 times the density will increase up to 5 1030 atoms cm 3 and the product n will be equal to n 7 1014 atoms s cm 3 so the lawson criterion is performed in this case it should be kept in mind that we have assumed the energy per one atom to be equal to wd 260 kev instead of 10 kev for which the lawson criterion is formulated and where the reaction cross section is a thousand times smaller than at the maximum 6 conclusion the total energy release in the d t reaction is 17 6 mev a 100 interaction of deuterium and tritium nuclei in the target ensures the energy release w 17 6 106 1 5 1014 3 5 1021 ev or approximately 560 j assuming that one gram of tnt releases 4 kj of energy the energy of a microburst in this case will be equal to 140 mg of tnt when the accelerator is operated in the continuous mode f 0 in 2 4 10 7 tube segments can be accelerated per one second if each segment releases 560 j of energy during the interaction with the deuterium tritium target the total energy release will be greater than 13 gj s or 13 gw the acceleration of the cone might provide best results for the compression of the d t target in comparison with the compression of the tube segment the cone needs to be accelerated with its base forward references 1 tables of physical data the handbook edited by i k kikoin moscow atomizdat 1976 16 2 s n dolya k a reshetnikova about the electrodynamic
