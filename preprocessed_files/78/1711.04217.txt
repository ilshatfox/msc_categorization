observer on the measurement can be substantial similarly the methods of observation can create entirely different understandings of the system behavior discussed here on a macro scale an example using

modes this work shows a genesis of what might be called 1 f noise which is explained herein by zienkiewicz using modal analysis the behavior also results from simplified analysis and simulation that

foucault s methods of observations with knife edge imaging to measure mirror shape in 1858 jean bernard le on foucault invented a method to measure phase that was later used to remove unwanted phase ef fects the schlieren method where all the spectra on one side of the central order are excluded 1 this uses foucault s knife edge in the fourier plane at a distance of the focal length from a collecting lens more recent physics discoveries use vibration to measure atomic size ef fects microscopy resolution smaller than the optical diffrac tion limit can be accomplished with the scanning tun nelling nobel prize and other microscopes that allow im ages of large s shells of atoms and even their p shells the vibrating variant the atomic force microscope afm is able to detect separate molecules by measuring the differ ence in van der waals force as a tiny cantilever scans over the sample changing its resonance this article describes how the nature of observation can provide an entirely dif ferent picture of the vibrational modes of common vehicles and other integrated structures three types of analysis provide support for this exposi tion of observation methods i experimental results of a driven clamped bar with full fixity at both ends provides a laser vibrometry spectrum for both small and large probe a dr pedro encarnac on of colorado springs and especially michael mckinley of arlington texas provided much appreci ated assistance www linkedin com in michaelmckinley 2001 remove spaces to activate link beam spot sizes ii a master s thesis 2 by the author contains calculation results of imaging a vehicle hull at 4 kilometers this allowed identification of the target ve hicle based on the laser vibrometry spectral fingerprint the target armor clattering against the vehicle hull pro vides a surface vibration that modulates the probe beam iii several analytical calculations using explicitly non linear mechanics validate the clattering spectrum these experimental simulation and analytical results provide cross supporting reinforcement for the three observational characteristics described in this paper this work defines three characteristics of composite structures such as vehicles 1 the lower frequency modes are nearly discrete 2 energy from driven modes flows into other modes and finally 3 due to theory and obser vations defined herein vibration strain energy is higher in the fundamental mode with energy decreasing as modal frequencies increase the latter two characteristics can be considered to be consequences of the second law of ther modynamics 3 an important issue to consider is how the probe beam spot size affects the observed vibration modes some vi bration modes may not be obvious from return due to a probe beam with a small spot size in the case of clat tering armor plates more mode information is acquired when viewing the entire optical image and processing its spectrum at multiple locations in spite of some interfer ence the non imaging spatially integrated radiant flux spectrum of the probe return from the entire target s sur face provides more information than the small spot size michael c kobold observations of nonlinear eigen states 3 in that phase information over time is embedded in the sensed signal 1 1 three observational characteristics based on the three previously mentioned supporting re sults the experiments simulation and analytical results three observations become apparent 1 the lower fre quency modes have sharp resonances that are effectively discrete responses figure 1 that can be modeled on center frequencies when damping is limited to structural damp ing 4 as we seen in figures 6 and 5 2 energy transfers from one component and its modes into the lower modes of nearby components through joints including welds which have nonlinear load deflection curves each mode is com prised of a 3 d mode shape deflection vectors of the entire structure figure 2 the strain energy modal en ergy of each mode couples to lower energy modes when and if the spectrum reaches steady state finally 3 modal energy flows into the lowest frequencies first figure 3 depleting the energy flow as the mode number increases from f 0 f 1 f 2 and up through the closely spaced high frequency modes that are practically infinitely dense al though for discrete modes fea is limited to the number of degrees of freedom dof in the model the energy at each of the modes shown in figure 1 transfers to lower energy modes if physical load paths ex ist that are conducive to mode coupling a transfer of energy from a strongly driven mode to other modes ap pears in figure 2 that driver might be in a component located far from the receiving modes but in frequency fig 1 at the fundamental frequency and a few higher modes the resonance quality q is high for systems without large damping the lower modes see figure 3 are effectively dis crete modes fig 2 vibrational strain energy from different components transfers from driven modes power symbol slanted to lower energy modes at different frequencies the nonlinearity of all common practical fasteners bolted and riveted joints allows energy transfer space they might be coupled it might be driven by the engine at one frequency yet sensed in the back seat at another frequency nonlinearities in response create har monics of resonances that allow energy to couple with lower modes the the low energy tails of wide resonances damped broadening also touch other lower modes an other energy transfer avenue is clattering where spatial distribution of mode amplitudes causes contact that ex cites different modes much like plucking a musical string at different locations can change the tone the concept of energy transfer between states relies on the frequency of the mode which is the square root of the eigenvalue in an analysis of normal modes 4 michael c kobold observations of nonlinear eigen states fig 3 as described by the zienkiewicz quote in section 3 high frequency modes eschew energy in favor of lower frequency modes therefore the lower modes fill up first but also retain more energy than higher modes unless the lack of vibration co herence can block the transfer or interfaces that act like active systems manipulate the energy figure 3 is a sketch where the final steady state of the vibrational system has energy ordered from strong reso nances at the fundamental frequency to a paucity of en ergy at higher frequencies a quote from zienkiewicz in section 3 provides an explanation for 1 f dependence of modal energy the models structures and observational characteris tics that comprise this article are summarized in the con clusion in table 6 1 2 physical model while conventional laser vibrometry systems can better identify many modes in an academic structure such as this solitary vibrating bar in the following photos by us ing a pencil thin beam a large spot size can adequately measure those modes and more this can be shown by simulation and analytical calculation the simulation uses finite element analysis fea for vibration deformation data that is handed off to a set of matlabtm functions that perform fresnel propagation for the optical sensing fig 4 coherent irradiance undergoes a spatially harmonic phase modulation as a function of the probe beam location due to target vehicle surface skin structural vibration eogb is the outbound gaussian beam emr is the modulated return and eref is the reference beam for this simulation model the fea shows the mode shapes and calculates the en ergy per mode which are the modal participation factors mpfs the fea surface vibration data is input for the matlabtm image propagation calculation fresnel prop agation 5 the physical schematic for the simulation appears in figure 4 laser vibrometers use many different methods that can have an affect on the precision of the measurements 1 the laboratory bar measurements show the signal to noise ratio snr is quite high for structural components and unless the system is purposely damped the reso 1 this interferometric model allows analysis of the phase modulation of the exitance from the vehicle the return hence its use for the optical analysis at some level even the portion of laser vibrometers that use doppler to measure vibration have images that are affected by phase modulation generated by vibration mode shapes this is in fact part of the mech anism of spectral elimination phase modulation is used here to determine the effect of mode shapes on the return for both imaging and non imaging systems michael c kobold observations of nonlinear eigen states 5 nances are sharp these sharp resonances lead to the dis crete mode picture that the field of modal engineering is built to exploit the literature provides the theoreti cal reasons that strain energy tends to eschew higher fre quency modes and thus populate the lower modes years of experience of vehicle design and analysis support these conclusions as does the fea of clattering armor plate the fea results show that unsymmetrical modes of the clattering plates have higher frequencies than symmetrical in phase vibration of the parallel plates and that these modes are discrete below 500 hz as is the case with typi cal automobiles these modes are usually easy for laser vi brometers to detect the optical image propagation model shows that even a non imaging spectrum of the surface of the clattering plates contains energy ordered modes whose vibration strain energy drops off with frequency as de scribed in the zienkiewicz quotation of section 3 commercial laser vibrometers use pencil thin spot sizes on the object being measured this is equivalent to one pixel s response from a large spot size imaging system non imaging signals average responses from all pixels for each time step an optimum automated target recognition atr system could use a combination of small and full illumination 2 structural nonlinearities a vibrating surface can be measured for dynamical prop erties by using any of several forms of laser vibrometry the type of laser vibrometer is less important than the phenomenology of what can be measured remotely a pri ori project restraints such as requirements to calculate a transfer function or to use pencil thin probe beams can limit the sensed spectra and thus omit or change the perceived vehicle behavior from reality in a manner un related to measurement or analysis error especially for complicated nonlinear systems it sometimes pays to ig nore detailed kinematic analysis which are often invalid for nonlinear systems in favor of modal engineering which tabulates the modes deformed shapes for particular reso nance frequencies their frequencies and their energy or modal participation factors for over half a century modal engineers have routinely done modal analysis for nonlinear vehicle structures this work uses a structural model of a plate bolted to another plate on a base structure the work also uses simplified and even linear component models but they cannot deliver the behavioural metrics that the full model pro vides they merely verify limited aspects of the nonlin ear model which is a crucial part of the overall analysis in the main analysis the structure is free floating system using d alembert reactions an analysis technique com mon to vehicle engineering see for example the numer ous quarter panel models in the literature 6 7 the sensor model is an optical model without the usual air turbulence analysis except to check for fante s wave front coherence breakup range 8 and a few other imaging issues 2 that are out of the scope of this paper the physical model for the clattering armor assumes a linear superposition of vibration modes on a nonlinear structure some effects that are ordinarily assumed linear 6 michael c kobold observations of nonlinear eigen states for structural dynamic response must be nonlinear at the outset for one this is not a linear time invariant system see the details of removal of these typical lti assumptions and its relationship to stability stabilization and stabiliz ability in the thesis 2 available through dtic dot mil also contain a treatment of how fixity changes the modes which can model aging of parts therefore the modula tion of the sensed optical radiant flux is related to the an alytical nonlinear expressions in the appendix that help explain the contact nonlinearity in the fea simulation the modeling complications related to fixity nonlinear ities and modal participation factors are dependent on control of the nonlinear solution per time step and over time the analyst also needs to make sure the solution follows the load deflection curve 9 the finite element analysis fea output represents the three dimensional structural model of the clattering armor plate system and provides the time history of the structural vibration that modulates the optical return recorded by the sensor the appendix contains a set of single and two degree of freedom analyses result in analytical ex pressions that provide insight into the fea results dis cussions concerning the need to have load increments it erations and other aspects of the fea solution follow the millions of degrees of freedom dofs each with their own load deflection curve are found in the author s the sis 2 the objective of the analyses is to use the optical images to determine the frequency of structural spectral modes for target identification id in recent conversations with navy scientists and en gineers the author found himself describing how the na ture of system observation plays an important role in per ception of the modal system and how the low frequency strain energy modes of the structure are quantized the discrete nature of the modes has been an underlying as sumption of modal analysis and in its application to ride and handling for over 20 years the modal participation factors describe the dynamics of energy flow by using vectors of mpf s that span the pertinent modes each mpf is an element in the fi vectors arrays ordered by mode number i used in the fea of vibrating struc tures such as vehicles antennas and spacecraft for ex ample nastrantm may require dmap alters macros to read out some of the components of fi an example of the unintended consequences of design decisions for the 1990 era corvette follows this detailed restatement of the three essential system characteristics introduced earlier they will be used in the example 1 the lower frequency modal states eigenvectors form dis crete modes even for complicated system synthesis models and the vehicles they represent the work of vehicle de sign for these issues focuses on 2 transition probabilities 2 and 3 the flow of strain energy that preferentially fills the lower modes with energy as discussed in the quoted passage in the next section 2 transition probabilities are related to structural coherence spectra by modal engineers who seek to reduce undesired vi bration modes resonances in the structure 10 11 michael c kobold observations of nonlinear eigen states 7 three observational characteristics of modal sys tems 1 the strain energy levels within each modal state are tabulated by the structural design team in order to determine critical components these critical regions ab sorb most of the ride and handling and structural engi neering effort during vehicle design resulting in a final list of lower frequency energy levels 3 the lower modes relate to modes shapes that are usually characteristic of the structure such as bending twisting and stretching a real life example appears later in this section 2 the transitions between modal states eigenvectors of the structure are often sigmoid in nature 4 where the region of rapid mode coupling depends on meeting strain energy thresholds that allow more efficient coupling be tween modes most of the energy tends to flow to compo nents with lower fundamental modes according to charac teristic 3 below nearly all joints are structurally non 3 acceleration spectra are measured in units such as strain related to strain energy amplitudes or acceleration per hertz but in practice the power is displayed signal processing power being the square element by element in g 2 hz how ever the optically sensed units are db hz 4 while there are systems where joints change behaviour on a short term basis during operation e g magneto rheological and similar semi active systems the sigmoid transition is usu ally driven by two factors a energy thresholds e g bolted joints have a bi linear load curve 12 and b design changes during the drawing release phase of vehicle development linear 5 for the transfer of forces and reactions a situation that provides substantial coupling nonlinearity 3 the low frequency end of the spectrum tends to hoard the majority of the strain energy as the quote from zienkiewicz explains these characteristics are summarized in the table 6 the conclusion analysis of mpf s developed by char acteristic 2 can determine state transition probabilities however modal engineers tend to be focused on solving critical failure issues engineers of any kind might use a different kind of mode for failure mode effects analysis fmea however modal engineering involves creation of a record of the order of the vibration modes followed by an analysis of the tracks of the modes as the design vari able change a structural vibration example described below shows how a structural design change can de couple modes in order to improve ride and handling however this change has consequences other than aesthetic design constraints the changes can increase crashworthiness risk and other seemingly unrelated systems and they can degrade previ ously adequate vibration and modal engineering balances 5 even spot welds have at least geometric nonlinearities in the green s strain tensor this is due to large strain related to dissimilar stiffness and offset load moments kick s in aerospace jargon nonlinearities are usually due to frictional hold of bolted or riveted joints that must be ignored in most structural analyses 13 therefore most system fea cannot model mpfs unless the model is nonlinear and designed to develop mpfs 8 michael c kobold observations of nonlinear eigen states in the design for example stiffening one joint or com ponent allows for a much more efficient flow of energy through that element of the structure strain energy is drawn from the high frequency modes to the low modes in a surprisingly efficient manner once such a structural channel is open components have structural coherence then the mpfs start to re balancing as the entire inte grated structure starts to equilibrate so a stiffener can solve one problem and cause another the engineering group that deals with braking and crash loads that trans fer from the front to rear bumper can have its margins go from adequate to negative due to a design change by the ride and handling team that solves a mode coupling problem this is similar to an old solution to convertible mode coupling 2 1 inter organizational effects of design changes the 1990 era chevrolet corvette convertibles an initial design had a fundamental bending mode just below 30 hz which put it very close to the suspension mode this is a overall vehicle bending mode that curves about a lat eral axis where the bumpers move vertically and together both in direct opposition to the vertical motion of the seats it is usually the lowest frequency vehicle mode for a convertible as if the vehicle is trying to do situps the corvette designers needed to stiffen this mode to reduce coupling to the nearby suspension modes they were also near 30 hz the models in the late 1980 s had very tall rockers that satisfied this requirement this was the most efficient structural fix because the stiffness of a beam to bending vertically is proportional to the cube of its section height 14 apart from the aesthetic issue with having to step high to get into the corvette these tall rockers also changed other load paths including a for aft transmission of load important to crashworthiness as well as making the vehicle slightly more heavy automotive is one of the few industries that has a price on the engineering suffi cient to remove a kilogram of mass which was 50 000 in 1990 these and other costs were accepted in order to move the fundamental bending mode away from the sus pension mode to effectively eliminate coupling for later years other technologies helped solve this issue with the exception of the pininfarina chassis test re sults 15 few modal analyses such as these chassis or body in white are in the literature to a scientist the ride and handling issues and how they relate to the three observational characteristics described above might seem to be basic enough to warrant several scholarly articles 6 however this is clearly the arena of trade secrecy at such a high level of value that corporate lawyers would be un surprised at the paucity of measured data available to the public 6 physicists in ann arbor were baffled surprised that a wheelbase change of less than 2 cm would require over a year of mechanisms analysis to re balance just the toe caster and camber in negotiations with competing requirements from groups that engineer tires turn radius vibration and crash worthiness michael c kobold observations of nonlinear eigen states 9 2 2 measured data vibrating clamped clamped bar pepela showed in his thesis 16 that the modes are not just maxima of a spectrum but spikes with huge snrs in the spectral response figures 5 and 6 from his thesis 16 each show a photo of the vibrating bar illuminated by a laser vibrometer with the corresponding vibrometer spectral density plot shown in the lower portion of each figure the first figure 5 shows all the major modes whereas the second figure 6 is missing the modes at 1460 hz in figure 6 the vibrating bar is seen to be illuminated by a laser beam with a large round spot size centered on the 1460 hz node of the vibrating bar in figure 5 the right half of the laser beam of figure 6 has been blocked illuminating only the left half of the 1460 hz node the halved beam size figure 5 allows the laser vibrometry spectral analysis system to show a stronger 1460 hz mode due to the elimination of spatial averaging introduce by phase related destructive interference from both sides of the 1460 hz node initially spectral elimination might appear to be a prob lem for the laser vibrometry industry for use with non imaging sensors if the spot size is large however pe pela s thesis 16 and another article by the author 17 with support from simulation and analytical calculations show numerically how unlikely spectral elimination is for commonly manufactured items even if the spot size en compasses the entire vehicle furthermore it is necessary but not sufficient that super symmetric structures pro duce spectral elimination in laser vibrometry 2 the vi brating bar is the simplest form of structural super symmetry fig 5 the image from a small spot size makes a spectrum with a f 3 1460 hz mode permission n pepela 16 17 that results in spectral elimination but it is rarely the only structural component a laser vibrometer can use for identification of a manufactured structural system vehi cle unless the target is the vibrating bar a structural oscillator that requires identification but even for such oscillators the typical transducer is a piezoelectric sys tem that is not super symmetric and thus not prone to spectral elimination it is not a driven bar therefore a vehicle that is purposefully fitted with vibrating bars can still be identified with its spectral fingerprint in spite 10 michael c kobold observations of nonlinear eigen states fig 6 a larger laser spot size creates a laser vibrometry spec trum where the f 3 1460 hz mode phase averages away of possible spectral elimination from oscillators pepela s result 16 was that use of small spot sizes reduces spec tral elimination from the laser vibrometry spectral result figure 6 vice 5 michael mckinley of arlington texas observed that figure 5 contains modes at approximately 2740 and 2900 hertz that are not visible in the small spot size collec tion in figure 6 while the small spot size is still large enough to average out higher frequency smaller vibra tion shape wavelength modes another spectral elimina tion that small spot size vibrometers are susceptible to is the effect of the probe spot being on a chladni line of nodes 18 of the vibration shape for particular frequencies 19 detection of these modes at 2300 2740 and 2900 hz is a positive observational difference provided by using a large spot size in this case 2 3 observational differences the difference between small spot size figure 5 and larger spot size figure 6 comprises one dimension of ob servation variation that can change the observer s view of reality physical systems such as the corvette design example can be used to explain the existence of the three characteristics of modal systems listed above contact non linearity is the main physical model of interest in this pa per because contact is a relatively simple and ubiquitous form of nonlinearity 3 zienkiewicz energy ordering proposition vibration strain energy transfers from one component to another usually through joints that are necessarily nonlin ear even spot welds depending on the amount of fixity of that interface or joint an extensive treatment of how fixity changes the modes and therefore the sensed optical radiant flux is in the author s thesis 2 b 2 3 p 187 in cluding nonlinear examples that compare to the contact nonlinearity of the fe model fixity is an engineering vari able for a particular dof that determines the ratio from zero to one 0 to 100 of force moment or torsion 14 michael c kobold observations of nonlinear eigen states 11 that will transfer from one component to another through the joint member for whom the fixity is defined 13 even simple vehicle structures have complicated non linear load paths mostly through joints where forces from one region of the vehicle affect parts nearly every where else on the vehicle these are the pathways for vi bration energy flow that tend to dump energy into low frequency structural modes modal engineers use isola tors and suppressors to stymie this natural tendency but mostly just for critical components some components tend to have non negligible vibration spectral energy down at these fundamental and near fundamental modes 7 even without the nonlinear effects damping helps drive the en ergy into the lowest modes because the resonance spreads widens to encompass a larger bandwidth zienkiewicz showed 9 340 341 energy transfer using only viscous damping to form a ratio of damping to its critical value 8 ci 2 ic i as quoted below for vibration systems that are driven by a forcing function f zienkiewicz describes the de ma ca ka f 0 using a mass matrix m a damping matrix c and a stiffness matrix k zienkiewicz quote we have indicated that the damping matrix is often assumed asc m k indeed a form of this type is necessary for the use of modal decompo sition although other generalizations are possible references given in the book from the definition 7 the fundamental mode is the one at the lowest frequency 8 critically damped systems remove all oscillation of c i the critical damping ratio described above we see that this can now be written as c i 1 2 i ati m k ai 1 2 i 2 i thus if the coefficient is of larger importance as is the case with most structural damping c i grows with i and at high frequency an over damped condition will arise this is indeed fortu nate as in general an infinite number of high fre quencies exist which are not modelled by any finite element discretizations 9 340 341 therefore vibrational strain energy tends to naturally migrate from higher to lower frequency modes for linear systems some of the strain energy can find its way down to the lower modes because over damping causes more over lap of modal response resonances nonlinearities add to the methods of energy transport as discussed later this results in a set of modes where the mode num ber increases monotonically with frequency and has an energy that decreases monotonically with mode number possible exceptions to this natural state include artificial structures 9 or temporary transients such as might be in troduced with magneto rheological fluid or other systems controlled by magnetic or electric field variations the 1 f phenomenon is found in many different fields of engineer ing 9 examples of artificial exceptions to the 1 f phenomenon could be exotic perhaps a feedback system might manually excite high harmonics without exciting lower harmonics such tapping very near the base on a taut chord would tend to excite the higher frequency mode 12 michael c kobold observations of nonlinear eigen states the local mode structure in pepela s laboratory test measurement in figures 6 and 5 which do not follow the 1 f phenomenon within the displayed 3 khz appears to be a contrary example this an example of not being able to see the trees within its part of the response spectrum of the very stiff clamped clamped structure for those results the vibrating bar only had a half dozen distinct modes across 0 3000 hz one of which was diminished in figure 6 the utility of the structurally super symmetric bar is that it shows discrete modes and that the energy in some modes is reduced by spatial averaging integra tion over the area of a surface of variable phase that intro duces varying levels of continuous interference depending in large part on the limits of spatial integration 17 but is this really a counter example of the 1 f phenomenon that it is not becomes apparent by analysis of the physics of a simple model of a spring of stiffness k this explanation considers multi variate non uniform paramet ric change in the system the maximum potential energy is approximately umax kx 2 2 where x is the largest extension of a simple spring assume that the frequency f 2 k 4 2 m is increased then the energy grows as the square of the frequency parabolically as u 2 2 mf 2 x 2 in practice the deflection x decreases with frequency as it must however there is a practical limit to reduction in deflection when that limit is reached while the fre quency continues to increase the potential energy must grow this means that higher frequency modes require more energy even for smaller deflection especially when deflection is already small when x 2 u 2 2 mf 2 the kinetic energy side of this simple calculation is rayleigh s method 20 it may help to see this from a force point of view using the gradient of u if the restoring force is conservative it is f u x 4 2 mf 2 x and is thus a quadratic func tion of the frequency f it might be tempting to consider a conjugate force for frequency where the gradient of u is 4 2 mx 2 f units of action energy time or momen tum distance 21 however the force f u x cannot increase ad infinitum at some point assumptions of linearity and structural integrity start breaking down let us combine the observations of this upper limit on the force and the understanding that the spring extension is limited to x 0 the proposition that the energy re quired to have a particular mode increases approximately quadratically on average in this sense of the other vari able being limited and experience that dynamical systems naturally tend to avoid populating the higher modes with energy many children experience this when they try to forcefully excite a higher frequency mode in a rope only to fail unless stressed to the point of overexertion a conjecture can be stated using the theory above for the system restoring force of simple harmonic motion based on the gradient of potential energy along with the fea simulation included herein figure 7 including in dustrial experience and the test data from the childhood of most of us as described above it is reasonable to as sume the conjecture that while system energy decays with frequency on average as described above a plot of the spectrum within its lowest half dozen modes might not michael c kobold observations of nonlinear eigen states 13 show the 1 f phenomenon but that the full pattern dues sometimes the spectrum plot is in the trees and the for est of the 1 f phenomenon over the entire large band width spectrum is not seen for those trees consider the in the trees ranges of 150 250 hz and 400 500 hz for the much lower fundamental frequency system of clattering armor in the fea results of figure 7 this plots several spectra of the artificial structure clattering armor there is one curve for each level of damp ing see legend and they show a different method of inter modal energy transport the 1 f pattern shows up in its structural vibration spectrum a collection of the deformed shapes for transient analysis in the csc thesis 2 shows how the transient result at each time step is a superposition of normal modes eigenvectors populated with energy according to the mpfs f looking at the normal modes displayed in the csc thesis it becomes ap parent how one mode at one frequency for one plate excites another mode at a different frequency on the other plate because of deflections that line up along the surface to contact the other plate at anti nodes of a different mode the lower modes tend to be receiving modes using appropriate structural damping the frequency response function in figure 7 is the result of an impulse load that rings all the modes of the fe model it appears to be natural that mpfs decrease with the mode num ber of the mode they measure the vector is an array of monotonically decreasing participation values in a time averaged sense usually measured as the strain energy for each mode this is part of the reason for the ubiquitous fig 7 the spectrum of several armor hull clattering systems except for the symmetrical modes the results for several with different armor hull baffle stiffnesses see legend 1 f phenomenon at least for structural vibration 22 we can thank the zienkiewicz section quoted above 9 340 341 for a partial explanation of this 1 f fall off in the quote above 4 simple harmonic motion not so simple a spring damper mass single dof system sdof pro vides a one dimensional model of the clattering armor plate which can provide analytical solutions to the vibra tion des assume small deflection where strain energy density is low enough for linear elasticity assumptions lack of permanent set in the structure being modelled also assume that modes are nearly monochromatic func tions of sines and cosines in a more formal development of the transfer of en ergy from one mode to another lord rayleigh points out that pure sine or cosine waves do not exist in reality he 14 michael c kobold observations of nonlinear eigen states derived the differential equations for newton s theory for isothermal compressive vacuum vibration resulting in this second order form 23 dy dx 2 d 2 y dt 2 dp d d 2 y dx 2 lord rayleigh then comments on the ability of sim ple harmonic motion to maintain shape in nature 10 the extent to which the mode shapes are not harmonic intro duces a possible corruption of the pure energy per mode concept assumed by mpfs in the scientific literature a mode is derived from the parameters used for the study of statistics which include the median mean and the mode in a field where gaussian distributions abound thanks to the physics described by the central limit theorem 11 the mode is merely the location on the abscissa in terms 10 since the relation between the pressure p and the den sity of actual gases is not that expressed in p const u 2 o 2 o we conclude that a self maintaining stationary aerial wave is an impossibility whatever may be the velocity uo of the general current or in other words that a wave cannot be propagated relatively to the undisturbed parts of the gas with out undergoing an alteration of type nevertheless when the changes of density concerned are small p const u 2 o 2 o may be satisfied approximately and we can see from dp d u 2 o 2 o 2 that the velocity of stream necessary to keep the wave stationary is given by uo dp d which is the same as the velocity of the wave estimated relatively to the fluid 23 11 the extent to which the literature supports the central limit theorem can be found in papers from 1937 through 2003 with uspensky 24 landon and norton 25 khinchin 26 north 27 and le cam 28 of the frequency for a spectrum at the maximum of the response in this sense the typical emphasis on energy in mode used by modal engineers is appropriate 10 to identify the deformed shape of the eigenvector for that approximate center frequency however transfer functions are inappropriate for these nonlinear systems even if mod ified as bendat does for simpler solitary nonlinear systems 29 4 1 contact nonlinear response the author s csc thesis 2 app f describes and plots the control law as a sigmoid using an arctangent function for the stiffness which is the slope of the load deflection curve the control law is a mathematical representation of the nonlinear stiffness associated with the contact state between armor and hull modeled by a sigmoid classifier this classifier is an arctangent function that defines the load deflection curve a smooth version of the typical bilin ear gap element load deflection table as the armor and hull make and break contact the stiffness switches be tween high and low values of stiffness respectively when the armor and hull are in contact negative deflection com pressive penetration results and there is a large stiffness due to the large slope of the deflection curve when the armor has separated from the hull the nonlinear contact stiffness becomes a deflection curve of small slope this small value of extra stiffness provides computational sta bility the author s thesis 2 contains a description of the stability and application of the control law demonstrat ing that the

vibrometry return from the probe beam the noise floor did not rise in figure 6 but rather the surrounding spatial areas had phase differences within the large spot size that due to spatial averaging underwent destructive interference in a bandwidth that removed most of the 1460 hertz mode 13 this interference is a combina tion of optical phase shifts along range caused by reflection from deflection amplitudes that are related to the struc tural wavelength along the bar for each mode the purpose of the vibrating bar measurement was to show spectral elimination but it also shows the discrete nature of high quality low damping structural modes the fea in the csc thesis 2 complemented this labo ratory measurement 16 by showing that while spectral elimination can occur with structures that might be con structed in the lab one dimensional modes shapes are the simplest super symmetric structures it is impractical to 13 due to the location of chladni lines of nodes for the 1460 hz mode the return contained doppler shifts from different phases of the vibration for that mode pepela s laser vibrometer 16 used these doppler shifts from different locations on the object that destructively interfered other laser vibrometers measure speed with two pulses or use other techniques build commercial structures that are substantially super symmetric the main result of the csc simulations was that aca demic models can produce reductions of vibration sensitiv ity that theoretically verify part of pepelas spectral elim ination thesis 16 within meaningful assumptions the single and two dof models described here show why this is the case theoretically a separate 2014 article 17 de scribes the lack of spectral elimination or spectral reduc tion for vehicle and other types of structures that are manufactured economically the lab vibration measurement shared some spectral reduction features seen in the nonlinear cross spectral co variance simulation 2 the transient vibration results for the surface of the 3 d armor plate were the input for a matlab system that forms an image similar to one that a laser vibrometer would detect commercial laser vibrometers typically only provide images processed with their proprietary system for the purpose of simu lating the image of the vibrating plate the csc thesis used conventional fresnel diffraction in a matlab sys tem of functions the fresnel propagation method intro duced by goodman 5 provides a computationally ade quate method to propagate an image of the return from the target back to the detector in this sense pepela s lab oratory measurement provided a validation for the fea and vice versa the laboratory measurements in figure 5 and 6 use a clamped clamped bar that has a high frequency fun damental mode compared to vehicle fundamental modes michael c kobold observations of nonlinear eigen states 17 that are below 50 hz the spectrum has not dropped off with frequency by 3 khz because this is still the lower frequency region for the structure as discussed in the section 3 it has a stiff fixity meant to test the laser vi brometer for structural wavelengths that would undergo a difference in phase across the beam spot size the spectral elimination effect figure 6 provided laser vibrometer manufacturers information on what spot size to suggest or program for their probe beams laser vi brometry manufacturer s have wanted to avoid such spec tral elimination the simulation and analysis in the csc thesis 2 shows users and manufacturers that even spe cially manufactured structures are not super symmetric and thus do not exhibit spectral elimination the 2006 csc thesis 2 compares both structural and optically sensed cscs to imaging versus non imaging re turns the latter choice of observation state non imaging is based on the analysis of a scalar signal composed of the spatial average of the entire image per time step using only one scalar metric non imaging

clattering structure may seem easy until the fact that the eigenvalues must be non linear complex functions becomes apparent while a two degree of freedom model developed in the appendix herein was meant to validate the fea the fea validates a major dynamical 2 dof analysis result unsymmetrical modes increase in frequency for increases in contact stiffness in vestigation of these closed form simple damped sprung mass systems 14 provides not only insight but qualitative numerical validation whether an eigenvalue increases for antisymmetric and un symmetrical modes when gap stiff ness increases provides another analytical basis for results seen in the fea additionally the behavior of the modes indicates that symmetrical modes are better target iden tication features than un symmetrical modes hence the need to analyze the energy balance and stability 2 app f to validate the simple one and two dof models as is summarized in the appendix herein including the time variation of amplitude and phase using the sdof model as a basis the appendix uses equation 3 to provide the 2 dof solution equation 3 may 14 sprung mass systems are an automotive term for a sys tems where vibration is being isolated or suppressed at an academic or free body diagram level they can sometimes be approximated by spring mass damper systems michael c kobold observations of nonlinear eigen

stiffnesses the structural and added damping e g wash ers or armor hull batting and the fixity of the joints initialy the two eigenvalues for the 2 dof system are equal as the closed stiffness increases a critical value of stiffness kcrit is reached where the armor can no longer follow the hull it starts to clatter in an unsymmetrical mode a 3 d contact surface cannot be anti symmetric unless it is axisymmetric 1 d but a 1 d models like the sdof and 2 dof models can when the stiffness exceeds kcrit the two curves become distinct branching into two separate paths this can be see for the plots of two mod els where the base stiffness is 128 and 1024 n mm in the region before clattering kcrit the slope of eigenvalue curves for the 8 kclosed higher base stiffness curve de creases eight fold compared to the smaller base stiffness at this higher 1024 n mm base stiffness there is also an eight fold increase in kcrit the intercept also increases 8 fold derivations of these concepts and further results including how the imaginary parts of the frequencies not 20 michael c kobold observations of nonlinear eigen states shown in figure 10 contribute to the transfer of energy between the modes are developed in the appendix 6 analysis and conclusion a structural vibration system model of a plate contact sys tem was shown to have effectively discrete low frequency modes both sdof and 2 dof models derived in the ap pendix have qualitatively verified the symmetrical versus unsymmetrical modes and the higher frequency of the unsymmetrical clattering modes the full finite element model transient results also showed the tendency for vibra tion strain energy to collect in the lower frequency modes as model engineers would attest and as was calculated an alytically in the classical literature 9 340 341 1 the lab tests on the doubly clamped bar show ex perimentally that high snr modes are effectively discrete in the absence of substantial damping they are not just the maxima of a spectrum but spikes in the spectral response 16 the system in figure 5 has a signal to noise ratio that is huge these massive snrs show that the lower modes of structure that are fairly high in frequency for this case due to the double clamped nature of the bar can easily be considered discrete hence q e d the observa tional characteristic 1 is demonstrated exposition of nonlinear eigenvalues provides results for theory and simulation for common nonlinear structures symmetrically moving parallel plates have more strain and thus more strain energy than clattering plates where the unsymmetrical motion interrupts their nearly sinu soidal in time out of plane motion to spew strain energy into acoustics and even permanent set deformation of the material through simulation 15 and by experience the observational characteristic 1 appears true that lower modes are effectively discrete for high quality systems low damping and that 2 and 3 damping and clattering help the energy flow into the lower modes from higher fre quency modes when there are pathways nonlinear joints that allow energy transfer although overall energy is lower as damping increases see figure 7 most vehicle components have bolted or riveted joints that allow such energy transfer 29 as can be seen with plots of coherence spectra coh f 36 2 the tools in industry that provide mpfs are ma ture engineering methods from the 1990 s such as the fea tools put in place for example by macneal schwendler coporation engineers in nastrantm 37 these mpfs stored in the fea vector can measure the energy

these concepts are summarized in table 6 pencil thin probe beams like that used in the lab mea surement have observational characteristics quite differ ent from the large spot size used for the fea matlab model of fully illuminated clattering armor the former is less susceptible to spectral elimination but the latter is adequate for spectral identification of economically manu factured vehicles such full coverage probe beams are less likely to be subject to spatial coherence issues or illu minate a node of the chladni zone 19 that can cause pencil thin beam returns to fail 18 since for the large full coverage spot size some of the beam is still getting through 16 transition probabilities are related to cscs calculated in the csc thesis 2 and the coherence spectrum 36 7 appendix two dof

composed of symmetric and antisymmetric one dimensional modes this solution ap plies to the symmetrical and unsymmetrical modes re spectively resulting from the fe model for the tank hull and armor the sdof model is a severely lumped mass model different symmetry adjectives are necessary for the three dimensional fe model because clattering modes where the armor is moving opposite to the hull does not have the laterally spatial uniformity implied by the word antisymmetric hence for 3 d systems the latter symme try adjectives are appropriate whereas for the 1 d system the former simpler words apply at first the derivatives act on the dimensionless system assuming all variables are nonlinear after starting with a restricted case we can bring the variables into explicit nonlinear use

so lution where the parts are welded together modelled as welded is equivalent to epoxied with hard rubber in the fe model 2 the latter reduces to the former for slight contact u 0 before compression u 0 as defined in equation 9 therefore the welded solution gives an in dication of the dynamics by investigating the behavior of variations in control law u from zero to one the switch ing control law for the contact u x helps determine the actual frequencies these frequencies have a cyclic varia tion one value for open gap and another for closed but as the nonlinear fea results show both systems are active on average energy flows into and out of both open gap and closed gap modes when averaged over many cycles the contact gap system is a time composite system its dynamics are best understood

not quite getting the better solution niques the noise and vibration industry developed these techniques with nonlinearities such as contact in mind 11 42 43 44 the energy flow oscillation as the system states evolve in an oscillatory manner might be a useful model for other systems where the physics may appear to forbid energy level ordering such disorder may happen on a time frame we are as yet unaware of however for vehicle structures experience indicates that the oscillation period is usually on the order of a minute to an hour the eigenvalues in equation 18 are therefore a dual set

the critical stiffness the symmetric mode settles into a constant eigenvalue with respect to regardless of the di mensionless stiffness 1 and 1 k 0 but not for 2 the higher frequency mode is the clattering mode which from the 3 d fea results in figure 7 and by expe rience and by zienkiewicz 9 340 241 is clearly the lower energy mode it takes far more energy to excite an anti symmetric mode to have the same deflection amplitude as a symmetric mode provided an avenue joint or structural connection to excite the lower mode the energy goes into the lower mode as any child whipping a taut cord to try to vibrate it at higher modes comes to understand for a moment 7 4 two dof nonlinear contact eigenvalues application of the sdof model over all dof s using a theory of linear structural

time invariant lti system has a relationship that has the same form as shown in a transfer function 2 p 81 but these functions are often inapplicable common vehicles are filled with nonlinear joints all of which can be adequately modeled in fea with some effort for the ensuing 2 dof system the results of the prior subsections and the 2 dof extension of the sdof theory are formu lated for entry

occur for stiffness lower than kcrit they indicate the symmetric and antisymmetric modes have the same frequency but that there are real and imag inary parts to the eigenvalues 32 171 this implies that there is a growth in energy for one mode and a decay in the other during the cycling of loads on most joints the con tact frictional footprint area also oscillates which varies the stiffness therefore the imaginary parts of the fre quencies act to re balance the strain energy the control law u t approximates this physics over time energy will move from the higher energy antisymmetric mode to the lower frequency symmetric mode unless it is suppressed however the low base stiffness situation repeated roots merely indicates that the stiffness of the base is so low that the close and far

eigenvector i in the matrix of two eigen vectors this is still a 1 d system but with 2 dof hull deflection and armor deflection there are three terms in the dynamical d e such as equation 10 but we can see that the system matrix is a from a 1 a i the simplifications include that the damping is uniform for both the base and contact stiffness line elements damp ing from the fixed base to the concentrated point mass modelling the hull is the same coefficient of the speed as the damping for the relative motion of the armor ver sus the hull the combination of low base stiffnesses and high switching stiffness due to use of a stabilizing open stiffness is stable not shown here see csc thesis 2 the more severe assumption is that dimensionless fre quencies are equal 1 2 setting the natural frequency of both the hull and the armor to be the same while this is a strong assumption it was understood that the fea will give proper simulation results for all modes also with this statement we are saying that the particular so lution is the same for both dof s which is not actually the case except for purely symmetric and antisymmetric modes however we know that physically symmetric and antisymmetric modes specifically these two modes alone comprise the complete set of time solutions in equation 19 for the 2 dof undamped sevp considered hence the assumption 1 2 gets validation from

eigenvalues defined for equation 22 is only a function of stiffnesses compared to prior mathematica results this 0 model provides a dc eigenvalue solution that is otherwise not available 2 t 1 2 t 1 k 1 1 k 1 25 this is only valid for 1 2 and 1 2 as de scribed earlier otherwise more nonlinear terms remain and the system is not susceptible to sevp solution for modes in equation 25 7 8 synthesis of the 2 dof sevp de first we can synthesize the system matrix to which these eigenvectors belong the kernel of the sevp is a 1 a i using the fact that 2 is the dimensionless fre quency the approximate system matrix a is available from michael c kobold observations of nonlinear eigen states 29 the terms of a 1 defined for equation 22 this is only ap proximate because of the many combinations of nonlinear and approximately linear variables like this linear se lected in dr major winthrop s dissertation 30 and used in the mathematical preliminaries part of the author s csc thesis 2 taking the matrix a 1 we can add a diag onal of i i 2 i i to extract a from a 1 a i a 1 2 1 1 1 2 kopen 26 equation 26 is essentially a 2 dof system with springs of stiffnesses k and and uniform damping of the same magnitude for both dof s eigenvectors and eigenvalues are easily recognized in relation to this standard evp in equation 27 using the assumption i 2 i 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 2 kopen i 1 i 27 7 9 synthesis of unmatched de k i i 6 k for clarification and to bring us back to the full nonlinear d e use the proviso that the eigenvalues for each dof are the same for each mode except here we use the phys ical argument leading to equation 19 to maintain the fundamental frequencies equal therefore the frequency subscript represents the same subscript as that for the eigenvector rather than matching the damping modes as done in the prior subsection but first define u the control law u x 1 of equation 28 is the nonlinear stiffness 2 fig 11 based on the relative displacement 1 l x 1 the arctangent switch occurs between the hull lumped point mass and the hra plate lumped point mass u 1 1 2 arctan kx 1 28 the phase k kt t kt relates to the eigen vector whose temporal dynamics i describes both dof

1 k 0 0 2 k 1 2 k 1 u x 1 1 1 kopen 1 2 k 0 0 29 equation 29 provides an iid estimate of the dynam ics modelled as n independent identically distributed os cillators since oscillators for each dof in a fe model and in continuous media reality are not independent nor of a random distribution in a structure this relationship merely guides independent behavior that quickly effects other dof s more importantly the nonlinear eigen value behavior in figure 10 shows how the symmetrical modes are affected by stiffness change 2 p 148 a lyapunov function form of energy balance is defined in the author
