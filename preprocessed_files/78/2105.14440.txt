far from thermal equilibrium in particular it is useful for investigating nonlinear dynamics exhibiting a variety of bifurcations leading to chaos 1 chaotic phenomena have been observed in conventional class b laser systems where polarization dynamics are adiabatically eliminated note that under most conditions these systems are stable except within some range of parameter and each system presents its own deterministic irregular behavior period doubling sequences transitioning to chaotic relaxation oscillations have been reported to occur in solid state co 2 and semiconductor lasers with a modulated pump injection current or loss at a frequency comparable to the relaxation oscillation frequency 2 4 subharmonic bifurcation cascades to chaos and coexisting periodic solutions have observed for various relations between the modulation frequency and frequency of the relaxation oscillation 5 subharmonic resonance cascades 6 intermittency 7 period doubling as well as quasiperiodic routes 8 to chaos have been demonstrated in semiconductor lasers with optical feedback in fact a variety of chaotic oscillations have been explored in a semiconductor laser coupled to an external cavity 9 which can be interpreted in terms of delay driven oscillators involving phase sensitive interactions between external cavity modes and relaxation oscillations 10 on the other hand it is known that laser rate equations can fully describe the motion of a particle in a highly asymmetric laser toda potential with respect to the ground state where the damping rate in the rate equations for class b lasers increases with the logarithmic photon density u t ln s t in time t 11 in the original toda oscillator system 12 the damping constant does not depend on u t in the absence of a driving force the particle approaches the ground state by exhibiting damped relaxation oscillations chaotic phenomena in the modulated class b lasers mentioned above can be interpreted in terms of a particle moving within the asymmetric laser toda potential the hamiltonian motion around the ground state namely the soft mode results from the balance between the damping force du dt and the driving force from a sinusoidal loss or pump modulation at a frequency comparable to the relaxation frequency such periodic soft mode oscillations correspond to sustained periodic relaxation oscillations around the stationary lasing solution s w 1 w w wth relative pump power normalized by the threshold wth by controlling the modulation frequency and amplitude the periodic hard mode oscillation which corresponds to regeneration of the first spike in the onset of the relaxation oscillation was demonstrated to build up from the nonlasing solution of the laser rate equations snl 2 w w 1 2 1 reflecting quantum spontaneous emission noise spontaneous emission coefficient such periodic spike mode oscillations have been demonstrated in solid state and semiconductor lasers by using deep sinusoidal loss as well as pump injection current modulations 13 16 if a strong modulation is introduced chaotic relaxation oscillations soft mode and chaotic spiking oscillations hard mode will be brought about analogously to a particle moving in the laser toda potential where the strong periodic force tends to push the particle irregularly in time because of the unbalanced damping and driving forces the coexistence of soft mode and hard mode attractors is predicted to exist in lasers with delayed incoherent optical feedback and a physical interpretation based on the laser toda potential has been given 17 on the other hand the effect of noise on nonlinear systems is an intriguing subject from the general viewpoints of nonlinear dynamics and applications in various devices an increase in the noise amplitude leads to degradation of the output signal in nonlinear systems however this is not always the case and a finite amount of noise can induce a dynamical state which is more ordered examples of such noise induced order include stochastic excitation of a subharmonic of a periodic modulation signal in a solid state laser upon modulation of the pump rate by noise and a periodic signal stochastic resonance in the presence of bistability 18 and upon the minimization of pulse interval fluctuations in the intensity of a laser diode with optical feedback when adding noise coherence resonance 19 however to date the studies on noise induced ordering have been restricted to the effect of externally applied artificial noise on the control parameter in real nonlinear systems intrinsic quantum noise always exists and it degrades performance here lasers provide a promising system for investigating the effect of internal intrinsic quantum noise spontaneous emission on nonlinear dynamics in a highly asymmetric laser toda potential in this paper we propose that a thin slice solid state laser with coated end mirrors abbreviated as ts 3 l subjected to doppler shifted optical feedback from a light scattering object is a well controllable stable and affordable system to carry out comprehensive dynamical and statistical studies in a wide modulation range in the ts 3 l the self mixing modulation effect resulting from interference between the lasing field and feedback field is enhanced because of the large fluorescence to photon lifetime ratio k p on the order of 105 106 owing to the extremely short photon lifetime 20 and quantum noise affects nonlinear dynamics through the 102 103 orders of magnitude larger spontaneous emission coefficient as compared with conventional class b lasers e g solid state and co 2 lasers owing to the small active volume the proposed laser enabled us to perform comprehensive studies on nonlinear dynamics and the effect of quantum noise on modulated class b lasers in a wide modulation range the present work elucidates the nonlinear dynamics hidden in class b lasers involving soft and hard mode oscillations for various relations between the modulation frequency and frequency of the relaxation oscillation and the effect of intrinsic multiplicative quantum noise spontaneous emission on hard mode spiking oscillations that are expected to occur under strong periodic modulation by paying special attention to the dynamic characterization of qualitatively different chaotic oscillations which were observed in the feedback ratio of light scattered toward the laser the intensity probability distribution was found to change from an exponential decay in the chaotic soft mode regime to an inverse power law in the chaotic hard mode regime via a chaotic itinerancy regime where stochastic frequency locking among two periodicities of soft and hard mode oscillations takes place and features a quantum noise spontaneous emission induced order in the amplitude and phase the inverse power law in the intensity probability distributions of the chaotic spiking oscillations in particular manifests itself in the laser toda potential over the years the universality of the inverse power law has attracted particular attention 21 22 for its mathematical properties and sometimes its surprising physical consequences in a diverse range of natural and man made phenomena all the experimental results were reproduced in numerical simulations of the model equation of a single mode self mixing ts 3 l subjected to doppler shifted delayed optical feedback from a moving scattering object the paper is organized as follows the basic properties of ts 3 l and self mixing laser doppler velocimetry are presented in sec ii experimental results on three types of chaotic oscillation are demonstrated for different feedback coefficients in sec iii numerical results are presented in sec iv they confirm that the experimental intensity probability distributions of the chaotic spiking oscillations follow an inverse power law and that there is quantum noise induced order in the chaotic itinerancy regime featuring stochastic frequency locking of soft mode and hard mode periodicities section v summarizes the results and discusses the physical significance of the observed nonlinear dynamics an analogy between class b laser rate equations and the laser toda oscillator model is presented in the appendix as an aid for understanding the soft mode and hard mode oscillations described in the main text ii ts 3 l property and self mixing laser doppler velocimetry scheme before discussing the characterization of the nonlinear dynamics of the ts 3 l placed in a state of chaotic oscillations by doppler shifted optical feedback scattered from a moving object toward the laser let us review the basic properties of the nd gdvo 4 ts 3 l used in the experiment and self mixing laser doppler velocimetry in the weak feedback regime a basic properties of thin slice nd gdvo 4 laser the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 a nearly collimated lasing beam from a laser diode ld wavelength 808 nm was passed through an anamorphic prism pair ap to transform an elliptical beam into a circular one and it was focused onto a thin slice laser crystal by a microscopic objective lens ol of numerical aperture na 0

1 ghz connected to a digital oscilloscope tektronics tds 3052 dc 500 mhz and a spectrum analyzer tektronix 3026 dc 3 ghz typical power spectra for different attenuations are shown in figs 3 a c where each power spectrum was obtained by averaging 100 power spectra measured at intervals of the update 160 s chaotic oscillations appeared when the round trip attenuation by the variable attenuator was ta 20 db the corresponding power spectrum is shown in fig 3 d fig 3 a c self mixing ldv signals under weak optical feedback with different roundtrip attenuations ta w 58 mw d power spectrum

intensity regimes and characterizes the dynamics in terms of intensity probability distributions poincar sections return maps of the peak amplitudes and phases and their degrees of disorder a soft mode chaos and hard mode chaos chaotic relaxation oscillations namely soft mode chaos occurred in the weak optical feedback regime 20 db 13 db a typical chaotic waveform and corresponding fast fourier transform power spectrum are shown in the top panels of figs 4 a b where fd was tuned to 3 mhz while the relaxation oscillation frequency without modulation was fro 2 mhz the power spectra of such chaotic soft mode chaos have broadened peaks around fd 3 mhz and fro 2 mhz on the other hand chaotic spiking oscillations namely hard mode chaos appeared in the strong optical feedback regime 9 db db an example waveform and corresponding power spectrum are shown in the bottom panels of figs 4 a b below note that the spiking frequency was measured from the time series to be on average fso 1 5 mhz however their power spectrum broadened and the fso peak could not clearly be identified from the power spectrum this point will be discussed in section iii b the intensity probability distributions for soft and hard mode chaos are shown in fig 4 c where fitting lines and pearson product moment correlation coefficients r are depicted from repeated acquisition of chaotic time series for various values of fd and fro in the regime of fd fro the intensity probability distribution was concluded to obey an exponential decay e for soft mode chaos and an inverse power law for hard mode chaos the

power spectra c intensity probability distributions the base of the logarithmic functions is e euler s number and 10 for soft mode and hard mode respectively w 50 mw the universality of the inverse power law for chaotic spiking oscillations is surprising because the intensity probability distributions of spike pulse waveforms in a periodic spiking oscillation deviate from an inverse power law as will be addressed in the appendix i in short spike pulses with random peak intensities and pulse widths are self organized such that an inverse power law is established for overall spike pulses in the long term evolutions this suggests that the laser toda potential system driven by a strong force exhibits self organized critical behaviour while it has been argued that earthquakes landslides forest fires sizes of power outages and species extinctions are examples of self organized criticality in nature 24 this point will be discussed in the appendix ii figures 5 a and 5 b show the poincar sections and return maps of the peak intensities and the time interval between peaks 1 and 1 for soft and hard mode chaotic oscillations the poincar sections of the soft mode and hard mode chaos show qualitatively different topologies and coexist in the phase space the standard deviations of the peak intensities ra a a and of the time interval between peaks rt t t are a measure of disorder in the amplitude and phase from repeated experiments ra and rt were evaluated be 0 31 and 0 25 on average for the soft mode chaos while these values were found to increase to ra 0 39 rt 0 31 on average for the hard mode chaos this suggests a larger degree of disorder in spiking chaos fig 5 a poincar sections of soft and hard mode chaos b return maps of peak intensities c return maps of time interval

chaos appeared and the survival times of the chaotic relaxation oscillations tro sum of dwell times in relaxation oscillations total time series decreased with increasing optical feedback leading to the chaotic spiking oscillations shown in fig 4 above ta 9 db in short self induced switching emerged in which there were chaotic relaxation oscillations and chaotic spiking oscillations at the boundary between soft mode and hard mode chaos this unusual behavior has been observed in lindp 4 o 12 ts 3 l modulated at harmonic frequencies of fro 25 where numerical simulations proved that self induced switching between the ruins of soft and hard mode attractors takes place deterministically even in the absence of quantum spontaneous emission noise therefore switching behavior manifests itself in the so called chaotic itinerancy namely ci frequently observed in vast complex systems 26 32 the concept of ci refers to dynamical behavior in which the system itinerates over the ruins of localized chaotic attractors in some irregular way while chaotic dynamics enables the system to form easy switching paths among the localized chaotic attractors 26 during this itinerancy the orbits visit a neighborhood of an attractor ruin with a relatively regular and stable motion for relatively long times and then the trajectory jumps to another attractor ruin of the system in addition in the present ts 3 l system subjected to self mixing modulations the laser s quantum noise has an intriguing effect on the itinerant behavior figure 6 a shows chaotic waveforms for different round trip optical attenuations ta observed at the pump power w 50 mw as shown in fig 6 b the survival time tro decreased according to an inverse power law i e tro ta the distinct power spectrum and intensity probability distribution observed for ta 11 5 db are shown in fig 6 c it is interesting that a clear peak appeared at the spiking frequency fso fd 2 1 5 mhz while it was broadened for the chaotic hard mode spiking waveforms fig 4 furthermore the relaxation oscillation frequency in the soft mode chaos fig 4 a which is depicted by the dashed line shifted from 2 mhz to fro 3 4 fd 2 25 mhz toward fd such a nonlinear frequency pulling of the relaxation oscillation frequency without modulations toward the modulation frequency fd has often been identified in the ci regime as for the intensity probability distribution the peculiar slope appeared to correspond to a quiet region of s t between the upper bound of soft mode chaos intensity fluctuations and the lower bound of hard mode chaotic fluctuations fig 6 chaotic itinerancy observed at w 50 mw a temporal evolutions for different attenuations ta b survival time of soft mode chaos versus attenuation c power spectrum and intensity probability distribution for ta 11 5 db the power spectrum shown in fig 6 c suggests nonlinear frequency locking among two periodicities fro and fso in the form of fso fro 2 3 through the self mixing modulation at fd in the ci regime to clarify this situation let us examine the dynamics occurring in the switching regions indicated by in fig 6 for ta 11 5 db through a joint time frequency analysis jtfa of time series 33 the results are shown in fig 7 a while the short term fourier transform power power spectra around ro and so chaos indicated by are shown in fig 7 b it is obvious that a 2 3 type of frequency locking is established in the switching region between the soft and hard mode time series during the temporal evolutions as indicated by at 3 fso 2 fro in fig 7 b on the other hand the degree of disorder in the amplitude and phase in the overall spiking time series is greatly lowered to ra 0 193 and rt 0 062 as shown in fig 7 c this implies that spiking chaos oscillations are tamed by frequency locking among the two periodicities fso and fro the appearance of such tamed spiking oscillations is presumably considered to involve quantum noise i e spontaneous emission since spiking oscillations are born from a nonlasing solution which depends on the spontaneous emission coefficient as mentioned in the introduction the quantum noise induced order will be addressed later in numerical simulations fig 7 a zoomed in views of time series for ta 11 5 db and its joint time frequency analysis b short term fourier transform power spectra around switching point c return maps

various sets of fd and fro experimental results exhibiting 3 4 and 1 2 frequency locking which feature tamed spiking oscillations are shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively as for fig 8 spiking oscillations were excited at fso fd 2 and exhibited subharmonic locking with 3 4 fro as indicated by while fro in the soft mode chaos was found to shift toward fd in the ci regime similarly to fig 7 as for fig 9 fd was tuned close to fro while fro was locked to fd and exhibited subharmonic locking with fso 1 2 fd 1 2 fro tamed spiking oscillations with decreased disorder in amplitude and phase ra and rt were brought about in both cases as depicted in figs 8 c and 9 c fig 8 chaotic itinerancy featuring 3 4 frequency locking w 46 mw ta 10 db fig 9 chaotic itinerancy featuring 1 2 frequency

time by using p 24 ps the threshold intensity feedback ratio for chaotic oscillations was found to decrease as increases numerical waveforms and the corresponding power spectra match the experimental results in figs 4 a and 4 b remarkably well in particular the peculiar power spectrum for chaotic spiking reproduces the experimental one in detail as shown in the bottom panel of fig 4 b the calculated intensity probability distributions for chaotic relaxation and spiking oscillations are shown in fig 10 c where correlation coefficients are evaluated to be r 0 996 and 0 992 respectively these values are also close to the experimentally obtained r for both chaotic relaxation and spiking oscillations in fig 4 c fig 10 numerical results on soft and hard mode chaos w 1 38 k 3 75 106 10 8

experimental results shown in fig 7 the calculated return maps of the peak intensities and their time intervals 1 and 1 for the overall hard mode spiking time series are shown in fig 12 c the associated standard deviations of the peak intensities ra a a and the time interval between peaks rt t t were ra 0 162 and rt 0 082 for tamed chaotic spiking oscillations these values are close to the average experimental values of ra 0 193 and rt 0 062 in the experimental results in the ci regime the parametric excitation of spiking oscillations due to harmonic frequency modulations at fd 2 fsp as well as resonant relaxation oscillations featuring a nonlinear fro pulling toward fd which reproduce the experimental results shown in iii b are considered to encourage subharmonic frequency locking of the two periodicities of the soft mode and hard mode in the ci regime in addition periodic spike mode oscillations due to harmonic frequency injection current and pump modulations were demonstrated in semiconductor and solid state lasers respectively 15 16 c numerical analysis of the effect of spontaneous emission noise on chaotic itinerancy let us examine the effect of spontaneous emission noise on self induced switching among chaotic relaxation and spiking oscillations on the basis of the numerical simulations self induced switching among the ruins of soft and hard mode attractors was already proved to take place deterministically even in the absence of the quantum spontaneous emission noise term in eq 2 25 on the other hand the experimental results and numerical reproductions shown in the previous sections strongly suggest that quantum spontaneous emission noise affects the deterministic chaotic itinerancy phenomenon i e taming of spiking oscillations presumably associated

indicates that the survival time of soft mode chaotic relaxation oscillations tro sum of dwell times in soft mode oscillations total integration time depends on the strength of the spontaneous emission noise i e to clarify the effect of on tro repeated numerical experiments were performed for different values of the survival time tro averaged over ten data sets of 10 7 points each is plotted as a function of in fig 14 a where the critical intensity that distinguishes hard mode spiking chaos from soft mode relaxation oscillation chaos was set to ic 0 5 for all datasets the survival time tro reaches a minimum value and increases afterwards as increases showing increased intensity fluctuations in addition the degree of disorder was evaluated in terms of the standard deviations of the peak intensities ra a a and the time interval between peaks rt t t for the overall time series of the hard mode spiking oscillations it is obvious that the degree of disorder reaches a minimum value at a certain corresponding to the minimum for tro around 5 10 8 as shown in fig 14 a fig 14 a survival time of soft mode chaos and degree of amplitude disorder versus spontaneous emission coefficient corresponding to fig 13 b power spectra near the optimum of 5 10 8 these results imply that an optimum value of exists at which chaotic spiking oscillations are mostly tamed over time through stochastic frequency locking among the periodicities of fro relaxation oscillation and fso spiking oscillation the power spectra for 1 10 8 and 5 10 8 are shown in fig 14 b they indicate that the relaxation oscillation frequency in the free running condition fro 1 1 mhz is pulled toward the self mixing modulation frequency and frequency locked to fro fd 1 32 mhz then chaotic spiking oscillations are excited at fso 1 2 fro the fso peak intensity was enhanced mostly at the optimum value of around 5 10 8 in this case as increases beyond the optimum value the system tends to develop chaotic spiking oscillations with increased disorder the theoretical results shown in figs 12 14 verify the effect of quantum spontaneous emission noise on deterministic chaotic itineracy phenomena

strength and frequency of the driving force in fact periodic spiking oscillations hard mode were realized in semiconductor lasers through the use of deep injection current modulation 16 and in solid state lasers through the use of deep loss or pump modulation at fsp fro 13 15 in the present self mixing modulation scheme periodic relaxation and spiking oscillations were obtained by tuning the modulation frequency fd and feedback rate ta as shown in fig 15 b and 15 c respectively the modulation frequency fd was tuned close to fro 2 7 mhz for the periodic soft mode oscillation while the periodic hard mode oscillation was obtained when fd was set to fsp 1 7 mhz the optical feedback rate was adjusted appropriately to preserve sustained periodic oscillations in both cases the pulse

large coefficient of determination of r 2 0 99 is attained in this case the asymmetric nature in the pulse shape in fig 15 d is considered to arise from larger initial population inversions in the onset of a spike pulse with a faster rise time and a slower decay time 35 furthermore it is interesting that the spike pulse waveform is formally equivalent to the following 1 soliton solution of the toda oscillator system 36 2 2 0 12 which is found by normalizing the time by 2 and setting in eq 11 to 2 where is the spring constant and n is an integer the intensity probability distribution p s for

is expressed by the following equation 2 1 3 2 3 13 p s increases monotonically in the region in the chaotic spiking oscillations shown in iii a chaotic spike pulses with different peak intensities sp i and pulse widths fwhm p i were fitted by the hyperbolic function given by eq 11 similarly to fig 15 d while p i increases with decreasing sp i this suggests that the self organized critical behavior in chaotic spiking oscillations obeys an inverse power law where chaotic spike pulses are organized in the laser toda oscillator system such that the overall intensity probability distribution for chaotic spike pulses during long term evolutions obeys an inverse power law finally let us show an intriguing functional transition of spike pulse waveform from the hyperbolic function given by eq 11 for hard mode spiking chaos to the gaussian function for quantum noise mediated tamed spiking chaos in the ci regime which has not been identified in the original toda oscillator system without noise fig 16 functional transition of spike pulse waveforms from hyperbolic to gaussian associated with quantum noise induced frequency locking in the chaotic itinerancy a b experimental results c d numerical results zoomed in views of the experimental chaotic spiking oscillation and tamed spiking oscillation in the ci regime corresponding to fig 4 a and fig 7 a are shown in fig 16 a the corresponding magnified waveforms of spike pulses indicated by the arrows are shown in figs 16 b together with hyperbolic and gaussian fitting curves figures 16 c d show zoomed in views of numerical results corresponding to fig 10 a and 12 a the numerical results reproduce the experimental ones the non trivial functional transition from hyperbolic to gaussian is apparent featuring large coefficients of determination r 2 all spike pulses with different peak intensities and tamed spiking oscillations were fitted by hyperbolic and gaussian functions respectively although a concrete theoretical explanation has been left as a future task we showed analytical expressions for a particle moving in a laser toda potential subjected to self mixing modulation the parametric excitation of the nonlinear oscillator responsible for subharmonic frequency locking of two periodicities through quantum noise as well as the mathematical equivalence between the spike pulse hard mode and soliton solutions of the toda lattice have been explored moreover the non trivial functional transition of spike pulse waveforms from hyperbolic to gaussian in the chaotic itinerancy was reproduced theoretically these results suggest the robustness of the model equations of a ts 3 l subjected to self mixing modulation eqs 1 4 and the corresponding laser toda oscillator expressed by eqs 7 10 appendix ii statistical graphics of chaotic spike pulses finally we show the intriguing relation between three quantities of peak intensity pulse width and pulse energy area of spikes which is established behind the inverse power law of intensity probability distributions each spike pulse waveform is approximated by a hyperbolic function while it exhibits an asymmetric nature with a long time tail depending on the peak intensity we calculated these three quantities for 165 spike pulses of chaotic spiking oscillations shown in fig 4 a by using originpro software as depicted in the top panel of fig 17 a the 3 d statistical graphics of spike pulses and its projections are shown in the bottom panel of fig 17 a individual pulse energies are self organized to lie on the parabolic surface given by 0 2 2 with a large coefficient of determination r 2 0 996 as shown in fig 17 b fig 17 statistical graphics of chaotic spike pulses fitting parameters ep 0 1 184 10 6 a 5 782 10 8 b 36
