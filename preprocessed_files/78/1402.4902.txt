measuring the size of nuclei of comets hidden by dust clouds are discussed to this end the dust cloud should be irradiated with a flow of rods accelerated in a linear mass accelerator to the velocity vfin 6 km s each rod should be equipped with a transmitter with a power of 1 w which is destroyed in a collision with a comet s nucleus or continues to work if the rod passes through the dust cloud without collision radio signals are received by three independent ground stations at a distance of r 1000 km from the nucleus of the comet the power of the received signals is psig 10 17 w the receiver noise power pnoise 10 20 w introduction to measure the size of nuclei of comets is very important since a comet even flying at a considerable distance from the earth can cause serious damage let us consider in more detail the possibility of exposing the dust cloud that hides the nucleus of the comet to the flow of rods each equipped with a radio transmitter 1 acceleration of rods 1 1 parameters of the accelerated rod we will consider acceleration of macroparticles shaped as a rod with a conical head which are electrically charged acceleration of rods in a helical waveguide is well studied 1 this acceleration requires that the initial velocity of the rod and the phase velocity of the wave were approximately identical as the acceleration of rods goes on the wave phase velocity in the spiral waveguide should be increased so that rod was always in the same phase of the wave called a synchronous phase the phase velocity of the wave in the waveguide can be increased by increasing the coil pitch or decreasing the coil radius or doing both at the same time 2 let the diameter of the rod be dsh 2 mm and length lsh 300 mm then the cross section area of the rod is str dsh 2 4 3 14 10 2 cm 2 and the volume of the rod is vsh 1 cm 3 the mass of the rod at an average density aver 5 g cm 3 is msh 5 g 1 2 the ratio z a we assume that the average atomic mass of the rod is ash 30 the number of nucleons in the rod can be found from the proportion 6 1023 30 g x 5 g where x 1023 atoms or ash 3 10 24 nucleons we take the surface tension of the electric field on the rod to be esurf 3 10 8 v cm using the formula for the surface tension of the field for the cylinder esurf 2 r 1 we find the charge density per unit length of the rod esurf r 2 e 5 10 7 0 1 5 10 10 300 2 1014 2 from which we can obtain np e lsh 3 10 15 3 thus if np 3 10 15 protons are set on the rod the surface tension of the field will turn out to be esurf 3 10 8 v cm now that we know the total number of excess protons on the rod np 3 10 15 and the number of nucleons in it ash 3 10 24 we can find the charge to mass ratio for the rod z a np a 3 10 15 3 1024 10 9 1 3 proton beam irradiation of rods to accelerate a rod shaped as a cylindrical rod with a pointed cone head in a spiral waveguide it should be electrically charged the electric charge 3 can be imparted to a rod by irradiating it with a beam of protons so that the irradiating protons remained on it then the electric charge of rods will increase in proportion to the proton beam current and the duration of exposure let the proton beam current be ibeam 0 5 a and the current pulse duration be beam 1 ms then the total number of protons in the current pulse is np ibeam beam e 3 10 15 protons 1 4 proton beam irradiation of rods proton energy let a cylindrical rod gas dynamically accelerated to vin 1 km s is exposed to a proton beam from an external source the field surface strength is assumed to be esurf 300 mv cm then for the diameter of the cylinder dsh 2 mm we find that the minimum energy of the protons that can overcome the coulomb repulsion of the protons previously placed on the rod should be wp eesurf dsh 2 30 mev 1 5 proton beam irradiation mean free path protons with an energy of 30 mev have a range in aluminum about 1 g cm 2 2 p 953 given the density of aluminum al 2 7 g cm 3 we find that the range of the protons in aluminum is lal 3 mm since the average density of the material we have chosen for the cylinder is aver 5 g cm 3 about twice the density of aluminum the mean free path of protons with an energy of 30 mev in the rod will be approximately 2 mm apparently it is necessary to gradually increase the energy of the protons during the irradiation as more and more protons are set on the rod the energy of the protons emitted later on the one hand should be sufficiently high to overcome the coulomb repulsion of the protons that are already on the rod and on the other hand should be such that the path of the protons in the material of the rod was much smaller than its diameter in this energy range the path of the protons in the material increases linearly with energy for example protons with energy wp 3 mev has a path 3 10 2 g cm 2 2 p 953 or about 100 and will not be able to cross the rod diameter of 2 mm they will lose their energy by ionization of the material and would stay within the rods 4 2 acceleration length the acceleration rate of a charge in an electric field can be written as w z a eezw 4 and for the strength of the wave ezw 70 kv cm the rate of the energy gain will be w 7 10 4 ev m nucleon so that the required increase in energy 0 2 ev nucleon will be attained over the length lacc w 30 m 5 3 selection of the spiral waveguide parameters the spiral waveguide is a standard coaxial cable with its central wire wound into a spiral in such a cable there is no dispersion in a wide range of frequencies i e the velocity of propagation does not depend on the frequency and the phase velocity in this cable coincides with the group velocity the wave pulse propagation velocity v in this cable is determined by the tightness of winding of the central conductor into a spiral and the dielectric properties of the medium that fills the cable this relation is called the dispersion equation tg 1 2 6 where v c v is the velocity of the pulse through the cable c 3 1010 cm s is the speed of propagation of electromagnetic waves in a vacuum tg h 2 r 0 h is the winding pitch of the spiral r 0 is the radius of the spiral winding it the relative dielectric constant of the medium filling the cable the wave as is runs along the spiral in a circle of 2 r 0 while moving a small distance h along the axis of the spiral the wave further slows down due to the dielectric properties of the medium determined by the value of to accelerate a body by a pulse running in a cable the insulator must be removed from inside the spiral and then the pulse velocity in this cable will slightly increase 1 5 2 tg 1 2 7 the pulse running through a line with distributed parameters contains not only the gradient of the magnetic field which are accelerated magnetic dipoles but also the electric field ezw which can accelerate a charged body the initial velocity of the projectile in a spiral sh in expressed in terms of the speed of light in v in c where c 3 10 10 cm s is the speed of light in a vacuum is in 3 3 10 6 and the final velocity is fin 2 10 5 spiral should apparently consist of several sections so that an optimal acceleration rate could be selected within each section the acceleration wavelength can be determined from the condition x 2 r 0 0 1 where x is a dimensionless parameter in the arguments of the modified bessel functions r 0 is the radius of the spiral is the phase velocity 0 is the acceleration wavelength in a vacuum and 0 s f 0 f 0 is the acceleration frequency with the initial radius of the spiral equal r 0 in 20 cm and the dielectric constant of the medium between the spiral and the screen 1280 we find 0 3 8 10 7 cm f 0 790 hz thus the slow wavelength for the beginning of the acceleration is slow 0 1 25 m 3 1 parameters of the spiral in order to obtain the required field intensity e 0 in the spiral waveguide we need a power to be introduced into it which is defined by the formula 1 p c 8 e 0 2 r 0 2 8 where p is the high frequency power introduced into the coiled waveguide r 0 is the radius of the spiral and is the phase velocity of the wave which is determined from the dispersion equation the braces in 8 are 1 i 0 k 1 i 1 k 0 i 1 2 i 0 i 2 i 0 k 0 2 1 i 1 k 0 i 0 k 1 k 0 k 2 k 1 2 9 where i 0 i 1 i 2 are the modified bessel functions of the first kind k 0 k 1 k 2 are the modified bessel functions of the second kind the first term in the braces corresponds to the flow propagating inside the spiral and the second term corresponds to the flux traveling outside the spiral since the space between the spiral and the screen is filled with a dielectric a factor appears in front of the second term 1 6 in this case deceleration of the electromagnetic wave to velocities of the order of the velocity of sound requires the use of both the geometrical properties of the structure small pitch spiral and the properties of the medium for which we chose the relative permittivity 1280 thus the flow of the high frequency power propagating outside the spiral is more than 103 times higher than the power that propagates inside the spiral therefore the first term inside the braces can be neglected and the value of the braces for the argument x 1 is approximately 4 in accelerators the synchronous phase is selected on the front slope of the pulse so that the electric field accelerating the rod is always lower than the peak value let us choose the synchronous phase s 45 0 sin s 0 7 ezw e 0 sin s thus the amplitude of the wave which accelerates the cylindrical rod should be e 0 ezw sin s 100 kv cm 10 then the wave power in watts expressed by the formula 8 is p w 3 1010 1010 102 4 3 3 10 6 1 28 103 4 8 9 104 107 300 mw 11 3 2 transition from a sine wave to a single pulse this power is achievable for pulse technology we expand the sinusoidal pulse 1 corresponding to the half wave epulse e 0 pulsesin 2 t t 0 2 t 0 0 0 2 f 0 in a fourier series t 0 2 f 1 2 1 2 sin 0 t sin t dt 12 0 the pulse spectrum is narrow and covers the frequency range from 0 to 2 0 since the spiral waveguide dispersion dependence of the phase velocity on the frequency is weak it can be expected that the full range of frequencies from 0 to 2 0 will propagate at an approximately identical phase velocity as a result the half wave sinusoidal pulse will spread out several fold in space due to only an increase in the phase velocity of the wave in this case the spiral waveguide should be matched with the supply feeder in 7 the band f 0 2 we introduce the concept of the pulse amplitude connected with the field strength in the axis of the spiral e 0 by the relation 1 pulse e 0 pulse slow 2 slow 0 0 c f 0 13 the wavelength choice 0 3 8 10 7 cm means that we choose the duration of the acceleration of the rod f 0 c 0 790 hz pulse 1 2 f 0 630 s the voltage pulse amplitude will be e 0 slow 2 2 mv and the pulse current through the coil windings will be p 150 a table 1 summarizes the main parameters of the accelerator table 1 parameters

electric field strength e 0 e 0 100 kv cm accelerator length lacc lacc 30 m pulse duration 630 s voltage amplitude 2 mv 3 3 the capture of rods in the acceleration mode admission let us calculate the required accuracy to match the initial phase of the accelerating wave pulse with the synchronous phase the theory of rod capture into a traveling wave gives 3 3 s s 2 s in practice it means for example that in our case where t 4 corresponds to the duration of 316 s or 900 degrees one phase corresponds to the time interval of approximately 3 s in linear accelerators the buncher gives bunches with the phase width 150 to avoid large phase fluctuations we require that the accuracy of synchronization of rods with the accelerating pulse be 15 3 s 45 s this synchronization accuracy seems quite attainable for the gun powder start that is preliminary gas dynamic acceleration of rods 8 let us now calculate the accuracy tolerance for coincidence of the initial rod velocity and the phase velocity of the pulse propagating along the helical structure we introduce the quantity g p ps ps which is the relative difference of the pulses 3 in the non relativistic case is simply a relative velocity dispersion of g v vs vs the vertical scale of the separatrix is calculated by the formula 3 gmax 2 w ctg s 2 s 1 s ctg s 1 2 14 where s 45 0 4 ctg s 1 1 s ctg s 1 2 0 46 2 0 46 0 9 and w z a ee 0 0 sin s mc 2 let us find w z a ee 0 0 sin s mc 2 the relative energy gain of the rod over the wavelength 0 in vacuum in our case 0 c f 0 3 8 107 cm sin s 0 7 mc 2 1 gev and w 2 66 10 5 substituting numerical values we get g vin vs vs v vs and finally v vs 2 66 10 5 6 28 3 3 10 6 1 2 0 9 0 3 thus the tolerable discrepancy between the initial rod velocity and the pulse velocity is of the order of v vs 30 for the initial rod velocity vin 1 km s of the tolerable velocity deviation is v 300 m s 4 radial motion as is well known 3 in azimuth symmetric wave of phase stability the phase stability region corresponds to the radial defocusing in this case we cannot have simultaneously radial and phase stability under the phase stability conditions external field are required for radial focusing in this phase regions the radial component of the electric field of the wave is directed towards the increasing radius i e radially accelerates the rods in this region of rod velocities hypersonic hundreds of thousands of times lower than the speed of light focusing by magnetic quadrupole lenses is not effective and electrostatic quadrupole lenses are most suitable for this purpose they focus the rods in one plane and defocus them in another collected into a doublet two such lenses give the resulting focusing effect the accelerator should be divided into separate sections and the focusing doublets can be placed between the acceleration sections 9 5 carrying rods away beyond the earth s atmosphere 5 1 lift when the length of the accelerator is lacc 30 m it should be placed horizontally to carry a rod beyond the atmosphere we can use a small asymmetry in the rod s shape such that it creates a lifting force fy the relevant equation of vertical motion can be written as mdvy dt cy 0 vx 2 str 2 15 where cy is the aerodynamic lift coefficient 0 1 3 10 3 g cm 3 is the air density at the surface of the earth vx is the horizontal velocity of the rod and str is the cross section of the rod 5 2 ballistics air resistance we calculate the motion of an electrodynamically accelerated rod equations of motion of the rod can be written as mdv dt cxstrv 2 2 16 where m is the mass of the rods vis the velocity 0 e z h 0 is the barometric formula for changes in atmospheric density with height 0 1 3 10 3 g cm 3 is the air density at the surface of the earth h 0 7 km is the height in which the density decreases by e times the aerodynamic coefficient or the coefficient of drag is a dimensionless quantity that takes into account the quality form of rods cx fx 0 v 0 2 str 17 equation 16 can be written as v t v 0 1 cx v 0 str t 2 m 18 to calculate the rate of change of magnetic dipoles with time it is necessary to find the aerodynamic coefficient cx 10 5 3 the calculation of the drag coefficient for air rods we assume that the rod is shaped as a cylindrical rod with a conical head the impact of a nitrogen molecule at the sharp cone causes a change in the longitudinal velocity of the molecules vx vx h 2 2 19 where h is the angle at the vertex of the cone the molecules of the nitrogen to pass rod pulse p mv vxstrt vx 20 the change in momentum per unit time the power the power of a frontal inhibition fx 1 vxstr vx h 2 21 dividing fx 1 by v 2 xstr we get the drag coefficient for a sharp cone in the mirror image molecules from the cone the newton cx air h 2 22 let the length of the conical part of the rod be lcone 12 5 mm and the diameter be dsh 2 mm this means that the angle at the vertex of the cone is t dsh lcone 1 6 10 1 and cx air 2 5 10 2 in order to have a pointed cone head the rod should be sufficiently long limiting the length of the rods is the fact that for a good efficiency of the acceleration length ltot rods should be less than a quarter wavelength delayed slow 0 i e ltot 0 4 in this case for the begin of the acceleration 0 4 40 cm 5 4 rod passage through the atmosphere let us draw up a table to show the time dependence of the vertical velocity lift and horizontal velocity of the rod the vertical velocity is calculated by the formula vy cy vx 2 str t 2 m 23 11 the climb is calculated by the formula hfly n 1 hfly n v y t cy vx 2 str t 2 4 m 24 where v y is the average vertical velocity in the time interval t a decrease in the horizontal velocity over time will be described by formula vx n 1 vx n 1 cx vxn str t 2 m 25 the change in the air density with altitude will be taken into account by the barometric formula 0 exp y h 0 where h 0 7 km table 2 shows the cylinder flight parameters as a function of time the second column shows the vertical velocity of the cylinder and the third shows the horizontal velocity of the cylinder the fourth shows the height it gained after the corresponding second of flight and the fifth shows the density of the atmosphere at this height table 2 flight parameters at cx cy 2 5 10 2 t s vx km s vy km s y km air g cm 3 0 6 0 0 1 3 10 3 10 3 72 3 67 18 2 10 4 in this case the time of gaining the maximum height is max vy g 367 s where g 10 2 km s 2 is the gravity acceleration the flight range is s vx 2 max 2700 km and the maximum height is y v 2 y 2 g 670 km 6 rod flight path control to control the flight path of the rod at its side surface is applied four quadrants of a material with different resonant absorption of laser radiation right left and up down deviations of the rod are effected by evaporating a corresponding quandrant exposed to laser radiation with a resonance wavelength 12 in silicon with different degrees of doping the langmuir frequencies pl will be different and therefore these four quadrants will have different resonant frequencies of absorption 4 thus we can assure that only one of the four quadrants namely that whose position is opposite to the direction from which the rod must be diverted will evaporate upon resonant absorption of laser radiation and produce a jet in order to evaporate the quadrant in a short time such that the heat from absorption of the laser radiation did not penetrate the body the laser pulse must be sufficiently short 6 1 parameters of the flight and trajectory change let the comet move as far from the surface of the earth as hcom 200 400 km and the distance from the comet to the floating platform carrying the accelerator and the laser is s 2 1000 km rod has a mass mb 5 g and moves with a velocity vb 3 km s when a mass mjet 15 mg moves at a velocity vjet 1 km s perpendicular to the rod velocity the transverse momentum transfer will be p mjet vjet and this will result in the deflection angle p mb vb 10 3 this angle on a distance from the target s 1 100 km will result in rejection of the body the trajectory l s 1 100 m 6 2 energy relations for the jet efflux the silicon heat capacity is csi 20 j mol degree 5 p 199 melting point tmel 1415 0 c solid liquid phase transition heat hm 50 kj mol boiling point teva 3300 0 c and liquid vapor phase transition heat hm 356 kj mol 5 p 289 considering all energy needed for evaporation and the fact that 1 mole of silicon is 28 g we find that evaporation of 1 gram of silicon requires an energy of 15 kj g for the average directed velocity of silicon atoms to be vjet 1 km s the thermal velocity should be vt 2 5 km s indeed after averaging the velocity in one of the transverse plane we get v 1 vt sin d 2 vt where integration over angles is from 0 to after averaging in two transverse planes we obtain v 2 vjet 2 2 vt 0 4 vt so that in addition to evaporation of silicon it is necessary to impart thermal 13 velocity vt 2 5 km s to its atoms for their average directed velocity to be vjet 1 km s we find the energy of the silicon atom moving with a velocity vt from the relation msi vt 2 2 si 1 5 10 19 j given that 1 g contains 2 1022 atoms we find that additional energy of the order of 3 kj g is required and the total energy consumption should be wlas 20 kj g 6 3 irradiation parameters consider the abilities of an infrared laser pulse at a distance s 2 1000 km from the irradiated body for the diffraction divergence of the laser beam to be sufficiently small it is necessary to integrate individual laser emitters into a laser array 6 similar to phase locking of individual emitters in a phased array antenna let the total diameter of the laser array be dgr 3 m then the diffraction divergence angle will be dif dgr 3 10 6 where 10 is the wavelength of the laser radiation thus at the distance s 2 1000 km the laser spot area can be estimated as s s 2 dif 2 30 m 2 let the area of the quadrant on the rod to be evaporated for diverting the rod to the angle p mb vb 10 3 be ss 3 cm 2 in this case the geometric factor is 10 5 so the laser energy required for heating and evaporating one gram of silicon is wlas 1 20 kj considering the geometrical factor the energy should be 105 times higher wlas 2 2 10 9 j and radiation energy required to heat and evaporate 15 mg of silicon will be wlas 3 30 mj thus laser irradiation of a rod at a distance s 2 1000 km from the laser followed by evaporation of one of four quadrants on the rod will impart a transverse momentum p mjet vjet to the rod which will give rise to the deviation angle p mb vb 10 3 at a distance s 1 100 km from the nucleus of the comet this angle will result in diversion of the rod from the unperturbed trajectory by l s 1 100 m 7 rod penetration depth into the nucleus of a comet let us find the rod penetration depth into the nucleus of the comet from the following considerations first we calculate the depth of penetration into 14 aluminum and then extend the results to the nucleus of the comet we take the density of aluminum to be al 2 7 g cm 3 5 p 99 the mass of 1 g mol of aluminum is 27 g the specific heat of aluminum is cal 24 35 j mol k 5 p 199 the melting point is tmel 660 c 0 the solid liquid phase transition heat is hmel 10 8 kj mol 5 p 289 and the boiling point is teva 2520 0 c to bring aluminum to a boil required 50 kj mol the liquid vapor phase transition is heat heva 293 kj mol 5 p 289 adding all up we find that evaporation of one mole of aluminum requires 375 kj and evaporation of one cubic centimeter of aluminum requires 37 5 kj cm 3 the cross sectional area of the rod is str dsh 2 4 3 14 10 2 cm 2 thus 1 2 kj are needed for evaporation of an aluminum cylinder with a diameter equal to the diameter of the rod and a length of 1 cm the kinetic energy of the rod mvm 2 2 at the velocity vm 3 km s is ekin 2 25 10 4 j from the data on reactions of meteorites with solids 7 it is known that at the velocity about 3 km s meteorites spend about 20 of their kinetic energy for evaporation of substance in our case it means that is consumed by evaporation and 4 5 kj will be spent for evaporation and the rod penetrates aluminum as deep as lpen 4 5 kj 1 2 kj cm 3 cm the nucleus of the comet has a lower density than aluminum but on hitting it the rod will certainly be destroyed at least the transmitter will stop emitting electromagnetic energy it will thus be possible to determine whether the rod passed through the dust cloud surrounding the nucleus of the comet or collided with the nucleus of the comet in which case the rod will be destroyed and stop transmitting radio signals 8 radio emission of rods suppose that the transmitter attached to the rod emits radio waves at a wavelength rad 3 cm half wave dipole with a power prad 1 w the parameters of the radiating pulse are taken to be the following the pulse width pul 10 s and the repetition rate frep 100 hz at a distance of 15 r 1000 km within the area of the receiving antenna sant 100 m 2 the power of the received signal will be pres prad sant 4 r 2 10 17 w the noise power of the receiver if the receiver is a superconducting cavity with tcav 1 k 0 will be pnoise ktcav f where k 1 38 10 23 j degree is the boltzmann constant tcav 1 k 0 f 1 1 pul 10 5 hz is the reception band since every second there will come frep 100 hz the reception band can be taken to be two orders of magnitude narrower f 2 10 3 hz this band corresponds to the resonator q factor q frad f 2 10 7 where frad c rad 10 10 hz is the frequency of the radiation as a result the received signal will exceed the energy noise by 3 orders of magnitude the q factor of modern superconducting resonators is of the order of q 5 1010 8 this means that the intrinsic bandwidth of the resonator is a few hundredths of a hertz fcav f 0 q and it will have to be specially extended to allow appropriately fast processing of the received signals 9 operation of the system equipment figure 1 shows a diagram of the equipment fig 1 1 floating platform 2 accelerator 3 rods 4 four channel ir laser 5 laser beam 6 radio waves emitted by a rod 7 three independent stations receiving the emitted radio waves 8 comet 16 the equipment operates as follows the electromagnetic mass accelerator 2 are located on the floating platform 1 it accelerates rods 3 to the velocity vin 6 km s due to the pointed cone head and small asymmetry rods penetrate the earth s atmosphere the rods having an azimuthally and vertical speed approximately equal v r 3 7 km s rods carry four quadrants of silicon with different degrees of doping so that each quadrant has its own resonant frequency of absorption to control the flight path of a rod it is irradiated 5 with four channel infrared laser 4 rods radiate radio waves 6 with the wavelength rad 3 cm and power prad 1 w radio waves are received by the receivers with sensitivity 10 20 w arranged on three floating platforms 7 determining the spatial coordinates of the rods rods pass through the dust cloud that hides the nucleus of the comet 8 without breaking to meet with the nucleus of the comet rods destroyed and cease to emit radio waves conclusions receiving signals by three independent receivers can allow us to restore accurately the spatial coordinate of the emitting rods and the presence or absence of the signal will allow us to judge whether the rod hit the nucleus of the comet or not if rod after passing through the dust cloud that hides the comet nucleus continues to emit radio signals it is precisely the area of the dust cloud if after passing through the dust cloud the rod ceased to emit radio signals it collided with the nucleus of the comet measuring the spatial coordinates of the rods that left the dust cloud hiding the nucleus of the comet and knowing the coordinates of the stopped rods we can calculate the size of the comet nucleus references 1 s n dolya k a reshetnikova about the electrodynamic
