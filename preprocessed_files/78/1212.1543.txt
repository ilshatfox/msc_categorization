optical solitons with non local nonlinearity we show an exact analytical solution to the nonlocal nonlinear nonparaxial propagation equation in the cases of high and weak nonlocality we also numerically find that the degree of nonlocality can af fect the width of nonlocal soliton beams but have no effect on their stability contrarily nonparaxiality can affect their stability but have no effect on their width keywords nonparaxial nonlocal nonlinear media stability 1 introduction a nonlocal nonlinear response played an important role on the optical spatial solitons over the years nonlocality exists in different physical media as nematic liquid crystals 1 photorefractive media 2 thermal 3 4 and so on various degree of nonlocality given by the width of the nonlocal re sponse function r x and the intensity profile of the beam can be divided into four types like local weakly nonlocal general nonlocal and highly nonlocal response 5 email address lihuagang gdei edu cn huagang

large angles of propagation 6 the first type of nonparaxiality results from the evolution of ultra narrow beams in nonlinear media in 1993 akhmediev et al cast doubt on the suitability and limitations of the normalized nonlinear schro dinger nls equation for describing the evolution of such beams 7 the scalar theory of the self focusing of an optical beam is not valid for a very narrow beam and a vector nonparaxial theory is developed from the vector maxwell equations 8 9 based on these equations crosignani et al have reported and analysed bright 10 and dark 11 nonparaxial solitons in contrast to the first type the second type of nonparaxiality arises from the rapid evolution of the field envelope of a broad when compared to the wavelength beam propagating at a large angle to the longitudinal axis 6 the scalar nonlinear helmholtz nlh equation well describe this nonparaxiality and overcome the limitations of the nls 12 exact analytical soliton solutions have been found in a focusing kerr type medium 13 nonparaxial theory based on nlh equation has also been applied to find dark kerr 14 two component 15 boundary 16 and bistable 17 helmholtz soliton solutions at nonlinear interfaces soliton refraction effects have a strong inherent angular character and constitute an excellent testbed for nonparaxial helmholtz theory 6 18 20 in this paper we investigate the nonparaxial solitons in the nonlocal non linear medium we find an exact analytical solution to the nonlocal nonlinear nonparaxial propagation equation in the cases of high and weak nonlocality in addition we numerically study the influence of the degree of nonlocality and nonparaxiality on the width and stability of solitons we devote sec tion 2 to a detail description of the theory model of the nonlocal helmholtz soltions section 3 studies the exact analytical nonlocal helmholtz solitons solutions which correspond to the high and weak nonlocality section 4 is devoted to studying the numerical solitons soluitions the aim is to illustrate the influence of the degree of nonlocality nonparaxiality on the width and stability of solitons section 5 summarizes the main conclusions of the paper 2 theoretical model for the simple one dimensional case the optical field satisfies the helmholtz equation 2 e z 2 2 e x 2 k 2 0 n 2 e e 0 1 2 where k 0 c is the propagation constant in vacuum c is the speed of light and is the frequency introducing a normalization appropriate to a forward propagating beam e x z a x z exp ikz a nonlocal nonlinearity n e n 0 n and assuming that the approximation n 2 e n 2 0 2 n 0 n where k is the wave number in the medium and n is the nonlinear induced change of the refractive index which satisfies w 2 m 2 n x 2 n n 2 e 0 2 where n 2 is the nonlinear coefficient we have employed the following nor malizations z z ld x 2 x w 0 u x z kn 2 ld n 0 a x z n n 0 kld d 0 d 2 w 0 is a transverse scale parameter that we shall later relate to the width of nonparaxial soliton beams this scale parameter can also be considered as equivalent to the waist of a reference paraxial gaussian beam at z 0 which has a diffraction length ld kw 2 0 2 wm is the characteristic length of the nonlinear response and d wm w 0 stands for the degree of nonlocality of the nonlinear response so we get the following non paraxial nonlinear schro dinger equation nnse for the dimensionless amplitude u of the light field coupled to the equation for normalized nonlin ear induced change of the refractive index 2 u z 2 i u z 1 2 2 u x 2 u 0 3 a d 2 0 2 x 2 u 2 0 3 b where 1 k 2 w 2 0 is the non paraxial paremeter of the nnse in the limits 0 and d 0 the nonlinear schro dinger equation nse can be recovered from the system 3 which describes a local nonlinear response at d 0 and a strongly nonlocal response at d for eq 3 b we can also write it into the form of convolution r x x i x dx 4 where i i x z u x z 2 r x 1 2 d exp 2 x d 3 3 exact analytical soltions solutions when the nonlocal response is high i e when the response function r x is wider compared with the extent of the beam so to find exact analytical solutions for the spatial solitons we expand r x z around the point x x and combine eqs 3 a and 4 to obtain 21 2 u z 2 i u z 1 2 2 u x 2 p 0 2 d u 1 2 p 0 x 2 u 0 5 where r 0 0 r 0 2 xr x x 0 r 0 0 because r 0 is a maximum of r x p u x z 2 dx is the beam power and p 0 is the input power at z 0 we search for a solution to eq 5 of the gaussian function form 21 u x z p 0 exp i z w z exp x 2 2 w z 2 i z x 2 6 where is the phase of the complex amplitude of the solution w is beam width represents the phase front curvature of the beam and they are all al lowed to vary with propagation distance z the real amplitude of the solution has the form p 0 w owing to the conservation of the power insert ing the trial function above into eq 5 we obtain that 0 w w 0 1 1 4 p 1 4 0 and dw 2 0 d 2 w 4 0 2 d 2 w 2 0 2 2 dw 4 0 p 0 2 dw 2 0 so we get the exact solitons solutions when d 2 01 the solution is shown in fig 1 a to illustrate the stability of the soliton we do the direct numer ical simulations of eq 5 with input condition u z 0 v 1 exp iv x where x is a broadband random perturbation v is the nonlocal nonparax ial soliton solution as an initial condition and v denotes transverse velocity parameter from fig 1 b we can easily see that the soliton is stable when the nonlocal response is weak i e when the response function r x is narrower compared with the extent of the beam so to find exact analytical solutions for the spatial solitons we expand i x z around the point x x and combine eqs 3 a and 4 to obtain 2 u z 2 i u z 1 2 2 u x 2 u 2 d 2 u 2 dx 2 u 0 7 where 1 2 r x x 2 dx for weakly nonlocal meda 1 is a small nonlocality parameter we search for a stationary soliton solution to eq 7 4 of the form u x z v x exp i z where the profile v x is real symmetric and exponentially localized and the propagation constant is positive 22 substituting this solution into eq 7 we can get 2 v x 2 2 v 2 2 v 2 v 2 v 2 x 2 0 8 eq 8 can be finally integrated to give the equation 22 x 1 v 0 tanh 1 v 0 2 tan 1 2 9 where v 2 0 2 2 2 v 2 0 v 2 1 4 v 2 this implicit relation gives the profile of nonlocal nonparaxial spatial solitons propagating in weakly nonlocal kerr like media when 0 and 0 i e for the paraxial case with local nonlinearity v x v 0 sech v 0 x the exact soliton solution is shown in fig 1 c when d 0 11 using eq 8 we can analytically find the power p v 0 1 4 v 2 0 2 tan 1 2 v 0 10 the derivative dp d can be gained from eq 10 easily and it transpires that the power monotonically increases with the propagation constant in dicating that the solitons are stable 22 23 to further demonstrate the stability of the exact soliton we also do the direct numerical simulations of eq 7 and find that the soliton is stable fig 1 d here v x is the exact soliton solution as an initial condition 4 numerical solitons solutions to discuss the influence of the degree of nonlocality and nonparaxiality on the width and stability of solitons we use split step fourier method ssfm and spectral renormalization method 24 to obtain the nonlocal nonparaxial soliton solutions by solving the equations 3 where a solution guess for field distribution is u x sech x fig 2 a shows the soliton solutions with the different degree of nonlocality d we find that the solitons power will increase with the degree of nonlocality d however as shown in fig 2 b when d 0 11 d 1 01 and d 2 01 the peak values of the solitons intensity u 2 max versus propagation distance are almost straight horizontal lines that is to say d does not influence the stability of solitons to illustrate the stability 5 of the solitons we do the direct numerical simulations of eqs 3 with input condition u z 0 v 1 exp iv x where v x is the numerically nonlocal nonparaxial soliton solution as an initial condition the result in fig 2 c shows that the solitons can be stable when d 0 11 which is consistent with the exact soliton solution next we discuss the influence of non paraxial parameter on the solitons properties from fig 3 a we can also see that non paraxial parameter has no effect on the field distribution when v and d are constant however can influence the stability of solitons in fig 3 b we easily find that the peak values of the solitons power u 2 max decrease with the propagation distance when 5 10 3 and 1 10 2 the solitons will be no more stable when 5 10 3 and 1 10 2 also we get the same conclusions by comparing fig 2 c fig 3 c and d that is the solitons will be no more stable when the non paraxial parameter is bigger when is bigger the width of nonparaxial soliton beams w 0 should be smaller the bigger can introduce the first type of nonparaxiality so the solitons are no stable 5 conclusion in conclusion we investigate the nonparaxial solitons in the nonlocal nonlinear medium we find an exact analytical solution to the nonlocal nonlinear nonparaxial propagation equation using taylor expansion when nonlocality is high and weak moreover we numerically find that the degree of nonlocality and nonparaxiality have different influence on the width and stability of solitons acknowledgments this research is supported by the natural science foundation of guang dong province china grant s 2012040007188 references 1
