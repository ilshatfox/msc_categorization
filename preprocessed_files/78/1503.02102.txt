classical plasma and for quantum plasma coincide graphic comparison of dimensionless size of a current quantum and classical plasma is made introduction dielectric permeability of quantum plasma was studied by many authors 1 9 it is one of the major characteristics of plasma also it is applied in the diversified questions physicists of plasma 9 14 let us notice that in work 1 the formula for calculation of longitudinal dielectric permeability into quantum plasma for the first time has been deduced then the same formula has been deduced and in work 2 in the present work formulas for calculation electric current in classical and quantum collisionless plasma at any temperature at the any degrees of degeneration of electronic gas are deduced the approach developed by klimontovich and silin 1 is thus generalised http arxiv org abs 1503 02102 v 1 at the decision of the kinetic equation we consider as in decomposition of distribution function and in decomposition and sizes of the self consistent electromagnetic field and wigner integral the sizes proportional to square of intensity or potential of an external electromagnetic field electric current expression consists of two composed the first composed linear on intensity of an electromagnetic field is known classical expression of an electric current this electric current is directed along the electromagnetic fields the second composed represents an electric current which is propor tional to an intensity square of electromagnetic field the second current it is perpendicular to the first and it is directed along the wave vector occurrence of the second current comes to light the spent account nonlinear character interactions of an electromagnetic field with classical and quantum plasma in works 15 and 16 nonlinear effects are studied into plasma in work 16 the nonlinear current was used in particulars in probability questions disintegration processes we will note that in work 17 it is underlined
