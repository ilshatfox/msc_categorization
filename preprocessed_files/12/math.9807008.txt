helffer sjo strand theory is a considerable addition to the de rham hodge theory for riemannian manifolds and can serve as a general tool to prove results about comparison of numerical invariants associated to compact manifolds analytically i e by using a riemannian metric or combinatorially i e by using a triangulation in this presentation a triangulation or a partition of a smooth man ifold in cells will be viewed in a more analytic spirit being provided by the stable manifolds of the gradient of a nice morse function whs theory was recently used both for providing new proofs for known but difficult results in topology as well as new results and a positive solution for an important conjecture about l 2 torsion cf bfkm this presentation is a short version of a one quarter course i

theory 0 introduction witten helffer sjo strand theory or abbreviated whs theory is a substantial addition to the de rham hodge theory cf dr and a powerful tool for comparing numerical invariants associated to compact manifolds analytically i e by using a riemannian metric and combinatorially i e by using a triangulation cf bz 1 bz 2 bfkm bfk 1 bfk 2 it states in a precise way the relationship between the de rham complex of a manifold and the cochain complex provided by a smooth triangulation when described with the help of a riemannian metric and of a morse function while there are other results which relate these two complexes whs theory provides a connection between these two complexes with scalar producs and permits to relate some of the spectral properities of the riemannian laplacians given by the metric and the combinatorial laplacians given by the triangulation the intuition behind the whs theory is provided by physics and consists in regarding a compact smooth manifold equipped with a riemannian metric and a morse function as an interacting system of harmonic oscillators this intuition was first noticed and exploited by e witten cf wi in order to provide a short physicist s proof of morse inequalities a rather simple but very useful result in topology helffer and sjo strand have completed witten s picture with their results on schro dinger operators and have considerably strengthened witten s mathemati cal statements cf hs 2 the work of helffer and sjo strand on the witten theory can be substantially simplified by using simple observations familiar to topologists cf bz 2 and bfkm as presented in hs their work although very appeal ing is not very accessible to topologists because of a large amount of estimates and preliminary results about schro dinger operators it turns out that not all of them are necessary and the witten helffer sjo strand work at least as needed by topologists can be presented and explained in a selfcontained manner and on a rea sonable number of pages cf section 5 bfkm this survey is a presentation of the whs theory with these simplifications hopefully accessible to a graduate student in geometry and topology and in a way appropriate to topological applications the mathematics behind the whs theory is almost entirely based on the fol lowing two facts the existence of a gap in the spectrum of the witten laplacians detected by elementary mini max characterization of the spectrum of selfadjoint positive operators and simple estimates involving the equations of the harmonic oscillator the witten laplacians in the neighborhood of critical points in admis sible coordinates are given by such equations witten s ideas presented below were used by witten to provide a new proof of morse type inequalities and holomorphic morse inequalities whs theory was also used to provide a new proof of the equality of analytic and reidemeister torsion and the l 2 version of whs theory to provide a new proof of the equality of novikov shubin invariants defined analytically and combinatorially cf bfkm the l 2 version of whs theory turned out to be not only important but so far an unavoidable ingredient in the proof of the equality of l 2 analytic and reidemeister torsion and of generalizations of this result cf bfkm d burghelea 3 1 triangulations from an analytic point of view let mn be a compact closed smooth manifold of dimension n a generalized triangulation is provided by a pair h g h m r a smooth function g a riemannian metric so that c 1 for any critical point x of h there exists a coordinate chart in the neighbor hood of x so that in these coordinates h is quadratic and g is euclidean precisely for any x critical point of h x cr h there exists a coordinate chart u x d 0 u an open neighborhood of x in m d an open disc of radius in rn a diffeomorphism with x 0 so that i h 1 x 1 x 2 xn c 1 2 x 2 1 x 2 k 1 2 x 2 k 1 x 2 n ii 1 g is given by gij x 1 x 2 xn ij coordinates so that i and ii hold are called admissible it follows that any critical points has a well defined index the number k of the negative squares in the expression i which is independent of the choice of a coordinate system with respect to which h has the form i c 2 h is self indexing i e for any critical point x cr h h x index x consider the vector field gradg h and for any y m denote by y t t the unique trajectory of gradg h which satisfies the condition y 0 y for x cr h denote by w x resp w x the sets w x y m lim t y t x in view of i ii and of the theorem of existence unicity and smooth dependence on the initial condition for the solutions of ordinary differential equations w x resp w x is a smooth submanifold diffeomorphic to r k resp to rn k with k indexx this can be verified easily based on the fact that w x ux x 1 x 2 xn d xk 1 xk 2 xn 0 and w x ux x 1 x 2 xn d x 1 x 2 xk 0 since m is compact and c 1 holds the set cr h is finite and since m is closed i e compact and without boundary m x cr h w x as already observed each w x is a smooth submanifold diffeomorphic to r k k index x i e an open cell c 3 the vector field gradgh satisfies the morse smale condition if for any x y cr h w x and w y are transversal c 3 implies that m x y w x w y is a smooth manifold of dimension equal to index x index y m x y is equipped with the action r m x y m x y defined by t z z t if index x index y and x 6 y in view of the transversality requested by the morse smale condition m x y 4 witten helffer sjo strand theory if x 6 y and m x y 6 the action is free and we denote the quotient m x y r by m x y m x y is a smooth manifold of dimension index x index y 1 diffeomorphic to the submanifoldm x y h 1 c for any real number c in the open interval index x index y the elements of m x y are the trajectories from x to y and such an element will be denoted by if x y then w x w x x the condition c 3 implies that the partition of m into open cells is actually a smooth cell complex to formulate this fact precisely we recall that an n dimensional manifoldx with corners is a paracompact hausdorff space equipped with a maximal smooth atlas with charts u u rn with r n x 1 x 2 xn xi 0 the collection of points of x which correspond by some and then by any chart to points in rn with exactly k coordinates equal to zero is a well defined subset of x and it will be denoted by xk it has a structure of a smooth n k dimensional manifold x x 1 x 2 xn is a closed subset which is a topological manifold and x x is a topological manifold with bound ary x a compact smooth manifold with corners x with interior diffeomorphic to the euclidean space will be called a compact smooth cell for any string of critical points x y 0 y 1 yk with index y 0 index y 1 index yk consider the smooth manifold of dimension index y 0 k m y 0 y 1 m yk 1 yk w yk and the smooth map iy 0 y 1 yk m y 0 y 1 m yk 1 yk w yk m defined by iy 0 y 1 yk 1 k y iyk y for i m yi 1 yi and y w yk with ix w x m the inclusion of w x in m theorem 1 1 let h g be a generalized triangulation for any critical point x cr h the smooth manifold w x has a canonical compactification w x to a compact manifold with corners and the inclusion ix has a smooth extension i x w x m so that a w x k x y 1 yk m x y 1 m yk 1 yk w yk b the restriction of i x to m x y 1 m yk 1 yk w yk is given by ix y 0 y 1 yk this theorem was probably well known to experts before it was formulated by floer in the framework of dimensional morse theory cf f in fact a weaker version of this theorem e g proposition 2 in l suffices to conclude that the linear maps intq s defined in section 2 provide a morphism of cochain complexes this is the only fact one needs in order to formulate the whs theory however theorem d burghelea 5 1 1 is a statement worth to be known as formulated theorem 1 1 is proven in ab the name of generalized triangulation for h g is justified by the fact that any simplicial smooth triangulation can be obtained as a generalized triangulation cf po we also point out that given a selfindexing morse function h and a rie mannian metric g one can perform arbitrary small c 0 perturbations to g so that the pair consisting of h and the perturbed metric is a generalized triangulation cf sm given a generalized triangulation h g and for any critical point x cr h an orientation ox of w x one can associate a cochain complex of vector spaces over the field k or real or complex numbers c m the diferential depends on the choosen orientationsox to describe this complex we introduce the incidence numbers iq cr h q cr h q 1 z defined as follows if m x y we put iq x y 0 if m x y 6 for any m x y the set w y appears as an open set of the boundary w x and the orientation ox induces an orientation on it if this is the same as the orientation oy we set 1 otherwise we set 1 define iq x y by iq x y m x y in the case m is an oriented manifold the orientation of m and the orienta tion ox on w x induce an orientation o x on the stable manifold w x for any c index y index x h 1 c carries a canonical orientation induced from the ori entation ofm one can check that iq x y is the intersection number ofw x h 1 c with w y h 1 c inside h 1 c and is also the incidence number of the open cells w x and w y in the cw complex structure provided by denote by c m the cochain complex of k vector spaces defined by 1 cq m maps crq h k 2 q 1 cq 1 m cq m q 1 f x y crq 1 h iq x y f y where x crq h since cq m is equipped with a canonical base provided by the maps ex defined by ex y x y x y crq h it carries a natural scalar product which makes ex x crq h orthonormal proposition 1 2 for any q q q 1 0 a geometric proof of this proposition follows from theorem 1 1 cf f or ab the reader can also derive it by noticing that c m as defined is nothing but the cochain complex associated to the cw complex structure provided by 6 witten helffer sjo strand theory 2 de rham theory and integration theory let m be a closed smooth manifold and h g be a generalized triangulation denote by m d the de rham complex of m this is a cochain complex whose component r m is the frechet space of smooth differential forms of degree r and whose differential dr r m r 1 m is given by the exterior differential recall that stokes theorem can be formulated as follows theorem 2 1 let p be a compact r dimensional oriented smooth manifold with corners and f p m be a smooth map denote by f p 1 m the restriction of f to the smooth oriented manifold p 1 p 1 defined as above if r 1 m is a smooth form then p 1 f is convergent and p f d p 1 f consider the linear map intq q m cq m with cq m maps cr h q k crq h x cr h index x q defined by intq x w x the collection of the linear maps intq s defines a morphism int m d c m of cochain complexes theorem 2 2 de rham int induces an isomorphism in cohomology theorem 3 2 one of the two main results of the whs theory whose proof will be sketched below is a considerable strengthening of this theorem d burghelea 7 3 witten deformation and the main results of whs theory let m be a closed manifold and h m r a smooth function for t 0 we consider the complex m d t with differential dq t q m q 1 m given by dq t e thdeth or equivalently dq t d tdh 3 1 d t is the unique differential in m which makes the multiplication by the smooth function eth an isomorphism of cochain complexes eth m d t m d recall that for any vector field x on m one defines the zero order differential operator x x m 1 m by q x x 1 x 2 xq 1 x x 1 xq 1 3 2 and the first order differential operator lx l x m m the lie derivative in the direction x by l q x d q 1 q x q 1 x d q 3 3 they satisfy the following identities x 1 2 x 1 2 1 1 1 x 2 3 4 for 1 1 m and lx 1 2 lx 1 2 1 lx 2 3 5 given a riemannian metric g on the oriented manifold m we have the zeroth order operator rq q m n q m known as the star hodge operator which with respect to an oriented orthonormal frame e 1 e 2 en in the cotangent space at x is given by rqx ei 1 eiq i 1 iq e 1 e i 1 e iq en 3 6 1 i 1 i 2 iq n with i 1 i 2 iq denoting the sign of the permutation of 1 2 n given by i 1 i 2 iq 1 2 i 1 i 2 i 2 i q n here hat above symbol means the deletion of this symbol 8 witten helffer sjo strand theory the operators rq s satisfy rq rn q 1 q n q id 3 7 with the help of the operators rq of an oriented riemannian manifold of dimen sion n one defines the fiberwise scalar product m q q m 0 m and the formal adjoints q 1 q 1 t q 1 m q m q 1 x q 1 m q m and l q x q m q m of dq dq t q x l q x by 1 2 r n 1 1 r q 2 3 8 q 1 1 nq 1 rn q dn q 1 rq 1 3 9 q 1 t 1 nq 1 rn q dn q 1 t rq 1 q x 1 nq 1 rn q n q 1 x r q 1 l q x 1 n 1 q 1 rn q l n q x r q these operators satisfy d 1 2 1 2 3 10 d t 1 2 1 t 2 x 1 2 1 x 2 lx 1 2 1 lx 2 and lx x x 3 11 note that l q x l q x is a zeroth order differential operator let x denote the element in 1 m defined by x y x y and for 1 m let eq q m q 1 m denote the exterior product by then we have q x e q 1 x 3 12 it is easy to see that the scalar products and the operators q q t x and l x are independent of the orientation of m therefore they are defined first locally and then being differential operators globally for an arbitrary riemannian manifold not necessary orientable and satisfy 3 8 3 10 3 12 above d burghelea 9 for a riemannian manifold m g one introduces the scalar product q m q m c by m m dvol g 3 13 in view of 3 10 q 1 t q x and l q x are formal adjoints of dq t q x t and l q x with respect to the scalar product for a riemannian manifold m g one introduces the second order differential operators q q m q m the laplace beltrami operator and q t q m q m the witten laplacian for the function h by q q 1 dq dq 1 q and q t q 1 t dq t dq 1 t q t note that q 0 q in view of 3 1 3 8 and 3 10 one verifies q t q t l gradgh l gradgh t 2 gradgh id 3 14 and that l gradgh l gradgh is a zeroth order differential operator the operators q t are elliptic selfadjoint and positive hence their spectra spect q t lie on 0 further as ker q t q m dq t 0 q t 0 one can see that for all t 0 ker q t is isomorphic to ker q 0 hence if 0 is an eigenvalue of q 0 then it is an eigenvalue of q t for all t and with the same multiplicity a very important fact in the proof of theorems 3 1 and 3 2 below is is that q t q is a zeroth order operator for any t the following result is essentially due to e witten and provides the first main result of the whs theory theorem 3 1 suppose that g h is a generalized triangulation of the closed riemannian manifold m there exist the constants c 1 c 2 c 3 and t 0 depending on so that for any t t 0 spect q t 0 c 1 e c 2 t c 3 t and the number of the eigenvalues of q t in the interval 0 c 1 e c 2 t counted with their multiplicity is equal to the number of critical points of index q the above theorem states the existence of a gap in the spectrum of q t namely the open interval c 1 e c 2 t c 3 t which widens to 0 when t 10 witten helffer sjo strand theory clearly c 1 c 2 c 3 and t 0 determine a constant t so that 1 c 1 e c 2 t c 3 t and for t t spect q t 0 c 1 e c 2 t spect q t 0 1 and spect q t c 3 t spect q t 1 for t t we denote by q m t sm the finite dimensional subspace of dimen sion mq the number of critical points of index q generated by the q eigenforms of q t corresponding to the eigenvalues of q t smaller than 1 the elliptic theory implies that these eigenvectors a priori elements in the l 2 completion of q m are actually in q m note that d t q m t sm q 1 m t sm so that m t sm d t is a finite dimensional cochain subcomplex of d t and eth m t sm d t is a finite dimensional subcomplex of m d for t t consider the composition of morphisms of cochain complexes denoted by l t m sm d t s t m sm d t eth m d int c m with sq t t n 2 q 4 etqid and d q t t 1 2 e tdq t s t is an isomorphism of cochain complexes referred to as the rescaling isomorphism the following theorem due to helffer sjo strand cf hs 2 provides the second main result of the whs theory theorem 3 2 helffer sjo strand given m a closed manifold and g h a generalized triangulation there exists t 1 0 depending on so that for t t 1 1 spect q t and l t is an isomorphism of cochain complexes moreover for t t 1 there exists a family of isometries j q t cq m q m t sm of finite dimensional vector spaces so that l q t j q t id o 1 t it is understood that cq m is equipped with the canonical scalar product defined in section 1 before theorem 1 2 and q m t sm with the scalar product defined by 3 13 theorem 3 2 provides inside m d t a reparametrization of m d induced by the multiplication operator ethsq t q m q m the finite dimensional subcomplex m sm d t which after rescaling is asymptotically isometric to c m recall that de rham hodge theory provides a canonical and unique representa tion of each cohomology class of c m by harmonic q forms with respect to g theorem 3 2 provides asymptotically a canonical and unique representation of the full complex c m and its base ex inside m d d burghelea 11 4 ideas of the proof of theorems 3 1 and 3 2 the proof of theorems 3 1 and 3 2 is based on a mini max criterion for detecting a gap in the spectrum of a positive selfadjoint operator in a hilbert space h lemma 4 1 below and on the explicit formula for q t in admissible coordinates in a neighborhood of the critical points lemma 4 1 let a h h be a densely defined not necessary bounded self adjoint positive operator in a hilbert space h and a b two real numbers so that 0 a b suppose that there exists two closed subspaces h 1 and h 2 of h with h 1 h 2 0 and h 1 h 2 h such that 1 ax 1 x 2 a x 1 2 for x 1 h 1 2 ax 1 x 2 b x 2 2 for x 1 h 2 then specta a b the proof of this lemma is elementary and is left as an exercise for the reader consider x cr h and choose admissible coordinates x 1 x 2 xn in the neighborhood of x since with respect to these coordinates h x 1 x 2 xn k 1 2 x 2 1 x 2 k 1 2 x 2 k 1 x 2 n and gij x 1 x 2 xn ij by 3 14 the operator q t has the form q k t q tmq k t 2 x 21 x 2 n id 4 1 with q i ai x 1 x 2 xn dxi n i 1 2 x 2 i ai x 1 x 2 xn dxi and mq k the linear operator determined by mq

n iff q k let sq rn denote the space of smooth q forms i ai x 1 x 2 xn dxi with ai x 1 x 2 xn rapidly decaying functions the operator q k t acting on sq rn is globally elliptic in the sense of sh 1 or ho selfadjoint and positive this operator is the harmonic oscillator in n variables acting on q forms and its properties can be derived from the harmonic oscillator in one variable d 2 dx 2 a bx 2 acting on functions in particular the following result holds 12 witten helffer sjo strand theory proposition 4 2 1 q k t regarded as an unbounded densely defined opera tor on the l 2 completion of s q rn is selfadjoint positive and its spectrum is contained in 2 tz 0 i e positive integer multiple of 2 t 2 ker q k t 0 if k 6 q and dim ker q q t 1 3 q t t n 2 e t i x 2 i 2 dx 1 dxq is the generator of ker q q t with the l 2 norm 1 for details consult bfkm page 805 choose a smooth function u 0 u r which satisfies u 1 if u 2 0 if u 4 3 introduce q t q c r n defined by q t x 1 q t x q t x with x i

the scalar product on sq rn induced by the euclidean metric the following proposition can be obtained by elementary calculations in coordinates in view of the explicit formula of q k t cf bfkm appendix 2 proposition 4 3 for a fixed r n 0 there exists c c c t 0 0 so that t t 0 and 0 imply 1 x 1 1 x n n q q t q t x ce c t for any x rn and multiindex 1 n with 1 n r 2 q k t q t q t 2 t q k 3 if q t with respect to the scalar product then q q c t 2 for the proof of theorems 3 1 and 3 2 we choose 0 0 so that for each y cr h there exists an admissible coordinate chart y uy y d 2 0 so that uy uz for y 6 z y z cr h choose once for all such an admissible coordinate chart for any y crq h introduce the smooth forms y t q m defined by y t m 1 y d 2 0 y t 1 y d 2 y q t 4 6 d burghelea 13 the forms y t q m y crq h are orthonormal indeed if y 6 z y z crq h y t and z t have disjoint support hence are orthogonal and because the support of y t is contained in an admissible chart y t y t 1 by 4 5 for t t 0 with t 0 given by proposition 4 3 we define j q t cq x q m to be the linear map determined by jq t ey y t where ey c q x is given by ey z yz for y z cr h q jq t is an isometry thus in particular injective proof of theorems 3 1 and 3 2 sketch take h to be the l 2 completion of q m with respect to the scalar product h 1 j q t cq m and h 2 h 1 let t 0 c c c be given by proposition 4 3 and define c 1 inf z m gradgh z with m m y crq h 1 y d c 2 sup x m l gradgh l gradgh z here gradgh z resp l gradgh l gradgh z denotes the norm of the vector gradgh z tz m resp of the linear map l gradgh l gradgh z q tz m q tz m with respect to the scalar product induced in tz m and q tz m by g z recall that if x is a vector field then lx l x is a zeroth order differential operator hence an endomorphism of the bundle q t m m we can use the constants t 0 c c c c 1 c 2 to construct c and 1 so that for t t 0 and 1 we have q t c 3 t for any h 2 cf bfkm page 808 810 now one can apply lemma 4 1 whose hypotheses are satisfied for a ce c t b c t and t t 0 this concludes the first part of theorem 3 1 let qq t t t 0 denote the orthogonal projection in h on the span of the eigenvectors corresponding the eigenvalues smaller than 1 in view of the elliptic ity of q t all these eigenvectors are smooth q forms an additional important estimate is given by the following proposition proposition 4 4 for r n 0 one can find 0 0 and c 3 c 4 so that for t t 0 as constructed above and any 0 one has for any v c q m sup x m qq t j q t jq t v c 3 e c 4 t v qq t j q t jq t v q m with similar estimates for the cp norm of qq t j q t jq t with p r the proof of this proposition is contained in bz 1 page 128 and bfkm page 811 its proof requires 3 14 proposition 4 3 and general estimates coming from the ellipticity of q t 14 witten helffer sjo strand theory proposition 4 4 implies that for t large enough say t t 0 i q t qq t j q t is bijective which finishes the proof of theorem 3 1 for t t 0 as constructed in proposition 4 4 let j q t be the isometry defined by j q t iq t iq t iq t 1 2 4 7 and denote by uy t j q t ey q m y cr h q proposition 4 4 implies that there exists t 0 and c so that for t t 0 and y cr h q one has sup z m 1 y d uy t z ce t 4 8 uy t z y t z c 1 t for z w y 1 y d 4 9 to check theorem 3 2 it suffices to show that w x ux te th t n 2 q 4 etq xx c 1 t for some c 0 and any x x cr h q if x 6 x this follows from 1 if x x from 4 8 and 4 9 d burghelea 15 5 extensions and a survey of applications 1 one can relax the definition of the generalized triangulation by dropping from c 1 the constraint on g to be euclidean in the neighborhood of the critical points this will keep theorems 3 1 and 3 2 valid as stated however almost all calculations will be longer since the explicit formulae for q t and its spectrum when regarded on s rn will be more complicated 2 one can drop the hypothesis that the morse function h is self indexing in this case theorem 3 1 remains true as stated but in theorem 3 2 lq t should be replaced by m sm d t eth m d int c m and j q t by j q t q t with q t cq m cq m t and t q 1 t q q t 1 the morphism of cochain complexes defined by q t ex t n 2 q 4 eh x ex x crq h cf bfk 3 3 one can twist both complexes c m and d by a finite dimen sional representation of the fundamental group 1 m gl v in this case an additional data is necessary a hermitian structure on the flat bundle in duced by the canonical scalar product on c m will be obtained by using the critical points the cells of the generalized triangulation and the hermitian scalar product provided by in the fibers of above the critical points the de rham complex in this case is replaced by m d of differential forms with coefficients in and the differential is provided by the flat connection in the scalar product will require in addition of the riemannian metric g the hermitian structure cf bfk or bfk 2 under the hypotheses that the hermitian struc ture is parallel in small neighborhoods of the critical points the proofs of theorems 3 1 and 3 2 remain the same an easy continuity argument permits to reduce the case of an arbitrary hermitian structure to the previous one by taking a c 0 approx imation of a given hermitian structure by hermitian structures which are parallel near the critical points since the witten laplacians do not involve derivatives of the hermitian structure such a reduction is possible if the representation is a unitary representation in a finite dimensional euclidean space one has a canonical hermitian structure in parallel with respect to the flat canonical connection in this extension was used in the new proofs of the cheeger muller theorem and its extension concerning the comparison of the analytic and the reidemeister torsion cf bz bfk 4 one can further extend the whs theory to the case where is a special type of an infinite dimensional representation a representation of the fundamental group in an a hilbert module of finite type this extension was done in bfkm for unitary and in bfk 4 for arbitrary in this case the laplacian q t do not have discrete spectrum and it seems quite remarkable that theorems 3 1 and 3 2 remain true it is even more surprising that exactly the same arguments as presented above 16 witten helffer sjo strand theory can be adapted to prove them a particularly interesting situation is the case of the left regular representation of a countable group on the hilbert space l 2 when regarded as an n right hilbert module of the von neumann algebra n cf bfkm for definitions one can prove that farber extended l 2 cohomology of m a compact smooth manifold with infinite fundamental group defined analytically i e using differential forms and a riemannian metric and combinatorially i e using a triangulation are isomorphic and therefore the classical l 2 betti numbers and novikov shoubin invariants defined analytically and combinatorially are the same for the last fact see see bfkm this whs theory was a fundamental tool in the proof of the equality of the l 2 analytic and the l 2 reidemeister torsion presented bfkm 5 one can further extend theorems 3 1 and 3 2 to bordisms m m m and a representation of 1 m on an a hilbert module of finite type in this case one has first to extend the concept of generalized triangulation to such bordisms this will involve a pair h g which in addition to the requirements c 1 c 3 is supposed to satisfy the following assumptions g is product like near m m m h m a b with h 1 a m h 1 b m a b regular values and h linear on the geodesics normal to m near w this extension was done in bfk 2 and was used to prove gluing formulae for analytic torsion and to extend the results of bfkm to manifolds with boundary 5 one can actually extend whs theory to the case where h is generalized morse function i e the critical points are either nondegenerated or birth death this extension is much more subtle and very important beginning work in this
