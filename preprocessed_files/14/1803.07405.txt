positivity of vector bundles and hodge theory mark green and phillip griffiths abstract it is well known that positivity properties of the curvature of a vector bundle have implications on the algebro geometric properties of the bundle such as numerical positivity vanishing of higher cohomology leading to existence of global sections etc it is also well known that bundles arising in hodge theory tend to have positivity properties from these considerations several issues arise i for a bundle that is semi positive but not strictly positive what further nat ural conditions lead to the existence of sections of its symmetric powers ii in hodge theory the hodge metrics generally have singularities what can be said about these and their curvatures chern forms etc iii what are some algebro geometric applications of positivity of hodge bundles the purpose of these partly expository notes is fourfold one is to summarize some of the general measures and types of positivity that have arisen in the litera ture a second is to introduce and give some applications of norm positivity this is a concept that implies the different notions of metric semi positivity that are present in many of the standard examples and one that has an algebro geometric interpretation in these examples a third purpose is to discuss and compare some of the types of metric singularities that arise in algebraic geometry and in hodge theory finally we shall present some applications of the theory from both the classical and recent literature outline i introduction and notation and terminology a introduction b

appear in hodge theory the applications use the positivity of hodge line bundle theorem i a 14 the semi positivity of the cotangent bundle to the image of a period mapping theorem vi b 1 and the semi positivity of the hodge vector bundle theorem i a 26 also discussed is the numerical positivity of the hodge bundles the overall subject of positivity is one in which there is an extensive and rich literature and in which there is currently active research occurring with interesting results appearing regularly we shall only discuss a few particular topics and shall use dem 12 a as our reference for general background material concerning positivity in complex analytic geometry as well as an account of some recent work and refer to pa 16 as a source for a summary of some current research and as an overall guide to the more recent literature the recent paper den 18 also contains an extensive bibliography for hodge theory we shall use ps 08 and cmsp 17 as our main general references following this introduction and the establishment of general notations and termi nology in sections i b and i c in section ii we shall give a synopsis of some of the standard measures and types of positivity of holomorphic vector bundles in section ii h we present the further result i a 9 below it is this result that enables us to largely replace the cohomological notion of weak positivity in the sense of viehweg vie 83 a vie 83 b with purely differential geometric considerations one purpose of these notes is to give an informal account of some of the results in gglr 17 and to discuss topics that are directly related to and or grew out of that work one application to algebraic geometry of theorems 1 2 2 and 1 3 10 there is 2 the following 1 i a 1 let m be the ksba moduli space for algebraic surfaces x of general type and with given pg x q x and k 2 x 2 then the hodge line bundle e m is defined over the canonical completion m of m moreover proj e exists and defines the satake baily borel completion m of the image of m m of the period mapping m d 3 the period mapping extends to e m m and set theoretically the image of the boundary m m m consists of the associated graded to the limiting mixed structures along the boundary strata of m as has been found in applying this result to the surfaces analyzed in fpr 15 a fpr 15 b fpr 17 and to similar surfaces studied in our work and in discussions with the authors of those papers the extended period mapping may serve as an effective method for organizing and understanding the boundary structure of m and in suggesting how to desingularize it 4 the construction of m is general and in brief outline proceeds as follows i one begins with a variation of hodge structure over a smooth quasi projective variety b given by a period mapping i a 2 b d here b has a smooth completion b where z b b is a reduced normal crossing divisor with irreducible component zi around which the local monodromies ti are assumed to be unipotent we may also assume that has been extended across any zi for which ti are the identity then is proper and the image b m d is a closed analytic subvariety som 78 ii along the smooth points z i of the strata zi i i zi of z there is a limit ing mixed hodge structure cks 86 and passing to the associated graded gives a variation of hodge structure i z i i di extending i across the boundary components of z i around which the monodromy is finite from the image of the extension of i we obtain a complex analytic variety mi then as a set m m i mi 1 significant amplification and complete proofs of the results in gglr 17 are currently being prepared below we shall give a short algebro geometric argument for the case when dimb 2 2 we shall use kol 13 as our general reference for the topic of moduli 3 the definition of a satake baily borel completion will be explained below here we are mainly considering that part of the period mapping that arises from the polarized hodge structure on h 2 x when pg x 2 we are in a non classical situation and the new phenomena that arise in this case are the principal aspect of interest 4 in contrast to the case of curves m seems almost never to be smooth even when m is 3 where on the right hand side there are identifications made corresponding to strata z i z j where zi zj 6 and where i j have both been extended across intersection points iii this defines m as a set and it is not difficult to show that the resulting m has the structure of a compact hausdorff topological space and that the extended period mapping i a 3 e b m is proper with compact analytic subvarieties fx 1 e x x m as fibres if we define om x ring of functions f that are continuous in a neighborhood u of x m and which are holomorphic in 1 e u and constant on fibres of e then the issue is to show that there are enough functions in om x to define the structure of a complex analytic variety on m iv using cks 86 the local structure of e along fx 1 e u can be analyzed this will be briefly recounted in section v below the main point being to use im plications of the relative weight filtration property rwfp of limiting mixed hodge structures v this leaves the issue of the global structure of e along fx we note that there is a map mx m 2 x h 0 n fx b where mx om x is the maximal ideal and n fx b fx is the co normal bundle of fx in b thus one expects some positivity of n fx b from fx z i e b we obtain 0 n z i e b fx n fx b n fx z i e 0 since i z i e i di is defined and maps fx to a point we obtain some positivity of n fx z i e denoting by mi x the maximal ideal in o i di x at x i fx from the local knowledge of e along fx we are able to infer that the positivity of n fx z i e that arises from mi x m 2 i x lifts to sections in h 0 n fx b thus the main issue is that of the positivity of n z i e b fx vi here as will be explained in the revised and expanded version of gglr 17 some apparently new hodge theoretic considerations arise in the literature and in this work there have been numerous consequences drawn from the positivity prop erties of the hodge line bundle and also from some of the positivity properties of the cotangent bundle of the smooth points of the image m b of a period map ping however we are not aware of similar applications of positivity properties of the bundles constructed from the extension data e associated to a limiting mixed hodge structure as will be explained in loc cit there is an ample line bundle l e and 4 an isomorphism i a 4 l n z i e b fx where i a 5 fx e associates to each point of fx the extension data associated to the lmhs at that point put another way assuming is generically injective since the associated graded to the limiting mixed hodge structure is constant along fx one may expect non trivial variation in the extension data to the lmhs s i e in in i a 5 or possibly some jet of should be non constant the map i a 4 then converts sections of the ample bundle l e into sections of n fx b 5 returning to the discussion of i a 2 a central ingredient in its proof consists of the positivity properties of the hodge line bundle e referring to gglr 17 and to sections iv b v and vi a below for details the chern form e of e is a singular differential form on a desingularization b of m and the exterior differential system i a 6 e 0 defines a complex analytic fibration whose quotient captures the polarized hodge structure on h 2 x when x is smooth or has canonical singularities and when x limxt is a specialization of smooth xt s it captures the associated graded to the limiting mixed hodge structure 6 as discussed above it is the extension data in the lmhs that is not detected by the extended period mapping in this way the satake baily borel completion is a minimal completion of the image of the period mapping the positivity of the hodge line bundle raises naturally the issue of the degree of positivity of the hodge vector bundle it is this question that provides some of the background motivation for these notes a vector bundle e x over a complex manifold will be said to be semi positive if it has a hermitian metric whose curvature form i a 7 e e 0 cf sections ii a and ii b for notations we shall usually write this condition as e 0 the hodge vector bundle is semi positive but the curvature form is generally not positive even at a general x x and general e ex an interesting algebro geometric question is how positive is it 5 in the classical case of curves this extension data is given by the jacobian variety of a smooth but generally reducible curve and l e is the theta line bundle given by the polarization it is interesting and we think noteworthy that constructions akin to classical theta functions can be given in non classical situations 6 of course one must make sense of i a 6 where e has singularities this is addressed in section vi e below 5 we shall say that a general bundle e x is strongly semi positive if there is a metric where i a 7 is satisfied and where i a 8 tr e dete 0 on an open set for example the hodge vector bundle is strongly semi positive if the end piece n of the differential of the period mapping is injective at a general point a condition that is frequently satisfied in practice 7 one of the main observations in these notes is i a 9 if x is compact and e x is strongly semi positive then for some r 0 5 ranke we have for m r 0 symm e 0 on an open set as a corollary symme is big for m r 0 as the proof of i a 9 will show although symme gets more sections as m in creases in general symme will never become entirely positive we will see in section vi e that the symme have an intrinsic amount of flatness no matter what metric we use for e 8 among the algebro geometric measures of positivity of a vector bundle e x one may single out i e is nef see section ii d ii some symme is big iii some symme is free i e symme is semi ample there are natural curvature conditions that imply both i and ii but other than the assumption of strict positivity which implies ampleness we are not aware of natural curvature conditions that imply iii for a specific question concerning this point suppose that l x is a line bundle and z x is a reduced normal crossing divisor assume that h is a smooth metric in l x whose chern form has the properties a 0 b for txx 0 x z and txz txx briefly 0 and the exterior differential system 0 defines z x then by a we see that l is nef and as a consequence of b l is big cf ii g now defines a ka hler metric on x x z and one may pose the i a 10 question are there conditions on the curvature r of that imply that l is free 7 for families of algebraic curves and surfaces this condition is the same as the differential being injective in general using the augmented hodge bundle there is a similar interpretation using the full differential 8 this is not surprising as one can always add a trivial bundle to one that is strongly semi positive and it will remain strongly semi positive somewhat more subtly a strongly semi positive bundle may have twisted sub bundles on which the curvature form vanishes 6 we note that by b the chern form defines a norm in the normal bundle nz x it seems reasonable to ask if the curvature form of this norm may be computed from limx z r x and if there are sign properties of this curvature form that imply freeness 9 remark that the construction of the completionm of the image of a period mapping i a 2 could have been accomplished directly if one could show that the canonically extended hodge line bundle e b which satisfies i and ii is free 10 here one has the situation of the above question in the case where h and have singularities along z however as discussed in section v these singularities are mild in fact the singularities tend to increase the positivity of the chern form of e in section iii we introduce the notation of norm positivity 11 this means that e x has a metric whose curvature matrix is of the form e ta a where a is a matrix of 1 0 forms arising from a holomorphic bundle map i a 11 a e tx g for g a holomorphic vector bundle having a hermitian metric the curvature form is then i a 12 e e a e 2 g where g is the norm in g many of the bundles that arise naturally in algebraic geometry such as the hodge bundle and any globally generated bundle have this property the mapping a in i a 11 generally has algebro geometric meaning e g as the differential of a map such bundles are semi positive 12 and their degree of positivity will have an algebro geometric interpretation remark one may speculate as to the reasons for what might be called the unrea sonable effectiveness of curvature in algebraic geometry after all algebraic geometry is in some sense basically a 1 st order subject the zariski tangent space being the pri mary infinitesimal invariant whereas differential geometry is a 2 nd order subject the principle invariants are the 2 nd fundamental form and the curvature one expla nation is that for bundles that have the norm positivity property the curvature form measures the size of the 1 st order quantity a in i a 11 13 another principal topic in these notes concerns the singularities of metrics and their curvatures and chern forms this also is a very active area that continues to play a prominent role in complex algebraic geometry cf dem 12 a and pa 16 reflecting the fact that in families of algebraic varieties there are generally interesting singular 9 in a special case this question has been treated in the interesting paper mok 12 we refer to i a 38 at the end of this introduction for similar questions concerning the hodge vector bundles 10 of course the semi ampleness of e b is a posteriori a consequence of i a 2 11 the origin of the term is that a quantity such as a hermitian form will be non negative if it is expressed as a norm 12 both in the sense of i a 7 and in the sense of nakano positivity dem 12 a 13 in this regard in the hodge theoretic situation we note that curvature r in i a 10 is a 2 nd rather than a 3 rd order invariant 7 members the role of the singularities of hodge metrics is central in hodge theory here there are two basic principles i the singularities are mild and ii singularities increase positivity the first is explained in section iv b intuitively it means that although the chern polynomials are singular differential forms they behave in their essential aspects as if they were smooth in particular although they have distribution coefficients they may be multiplied and restricted to particular subvarieties as if they were smooth forms this last property is central to the proof of i a 1 above the first major steps in the general analysis of the singularities of the chern forms of hodge bundles for several parameter variations of hodge structure were taken by cattani kaplan schmid cks 86 with subsequent refinements and amplifications by a number of people including kolla r kol 87 in the paper gglr 17 further steps are taken ones that may be thought of as further refining the properties of the wave front sets of the chern forms this will be explained in section iv b and will be applied in section v where an alternate proof of one of the two main ingredients in the proof of i a 14 below will be given the result i a 1 is an application to a desingularization of a ksba moduli space of a result that we now explain referring to sections i b and i c for explanations of notation and terminology let b be a smooth projective variety with smooth completion b such that b b z zi is a reduced normal crossing divisor we denote by zi i i zi the strata of z and by z i zi reg the smooth points of zi we consider a variation of hodge structure over b given by a period mapping i a 13 b d we assume that the local monodromies ti around the zi are unipotent with logarithms ni an assumption that may always be achieved by passing to a finite covering of b 14 we also suppose that the end piece n tb hom f n f n 1 f n of the differential of is generically injective 15 finally assuming as we may that all ni 6 0 the image b m d of the period mapping i a 13 is a closed analytic subvariety of d beginning with som 78 there have been results stating that under certain conditions m is a quasi projective variety and the hodge line bundle m is at least big the following result from gglr 17 serves to extend and clarify the previous work in the literature theorem i a 14 there exists a canonical completion m of m as a compact complex analytic space that has the properties 14 we will use ps 08 cmsp 17 and cks 86 as general references for hodge theory including limiting mixed hodge structures 15 by using the augmented hodge line bundle bn 1 2 c p 0 det fn p rather than just the hodge line bundle detfn this assumption may be replaced by the injectivity of cf gglr 17 8 i the hodge bundle extends to e m and there it is ample and ii m is a satake baily borel completion of m the second statement means the following the period mapping i a 13 extends to i a 15 e b m along the non singular strata z i the exented period mapping e induces variations of graded polarized limiting mixed hodge structures and passing to the associated graded of these mixed hodge structures gives period mappings i a 16 i z i i di then the restriction to z i of e in i a 15 may be identified with i setting mi i z i i di as a set m mq imi the precise meaning of this is explained in gglr 17 among other things it means that proj e b exists and on the boundary strata exactly detects the variation of the associated graded to the limiting mixed hodge structures 16 the exterior differential system i a 6 defined by the singular differential form e may be made sense of on b cf section vi e and there it defines a fibration by complex analytic subvarieties whose quotient is just m the restriction property of e referred to above may be summarized as saying that i a 17 e z i is defined and is equal to i where i is the chern form of the hodge line bundle associated to i a 16 an implication of the above is i a 18 e is defined on m and there e 0 17 one aspect of this is that given b and b as above the eds i a 19 0 on b i 0 on the z i 16 we remark that in the non classical case when d is not an algebraic variety the construction of m is necessarily accomplished by gluing together local extensions of m at the points of m m m this requires both a local analysis based on cks 86 of local neighborhoods in along the fibres f of the set theoretically extended period map together with global analysis of those fibres and especially of the above mentioned positivity of the co normal bundle n f b as mentioned above global issues necessitate apparently new hodge theoretic constructions arising from the extension data in a limiting mixed hodge structure even in the classical case this seems to give a new perspective on the satake baily borel compactification 17 in general given a fibration f a b between manifolds a b and a smooth differential form a on a the necessary and sufficient conditions that a f b for a smooth differential form b on b are that both a and its exterior derivative d a restrict to zero on ker f ta tb ta the above results extend this to a situation where a is a possibly singular differential form 9 on the smooth strata defines on each a complex analytic fibration and a natural question is i a 20 for i j so that we have z j z i does the closure of a fibre of i 0 in z i intersect z j in a fibre of j 0 are the limits of the fibres of i contained in the fibres of j in other words do the period mappings given by on b and i on z i fit together in an analytic way that this is the case is proved in section 3 of gglr 17 cf step 1 in the proof of theorem 3 15 there although not directly related to the positivity of hodge bundles because of the subtle way in which the relative weight filtration property of a several parameter degeneration of polarized hodge structures enters in the argument we think the result is of interest in its own right and in section vi a we have given a proof in the main special case of a positive answer to i a 20 in section vi we shall give applications of some of the bundles that naturally arise in hodge theory as explained above one such application is the use of the hodge line bundle in proving that its proj defines the satake baily borel completion of the image of a period mapping the next application is to the cotangent bundle 1 mo over the smooth points m o of m it is classical cmsp 17 that the induced metric on m o d is ka hler and has holomorphic sectional curvatures r 5 c tm o bounded above by a constant c where c 0 on the other hand the more basic curvature form for tm o is given by the holomorphic bi sectional curvatures r and we shall prove cf theorem vi b 1 that they satisfy r 5 0 and r 0 is an open u set in tm o mo tm o moreover u projects onto each factor in m o m o i a 21 an interesting point here is that the induced curvature on the horizontal sub bundle td h td is a difference of non negative terms each of which has the norm positivity property i a 12 on integrable subspaces i of td h the positive term drops out leading to i a 21 18 a consequence of i a 21 is i a 22 the curvature form t mo 0 and it is positive on an open set to apply i a 22 two further steps are required one is that curvatures decrease on holomorphic sub bundles which in the case at hand is used in the form i a 23 i 5 td h i 18 in general the curvature matrices of hodge bundles are differences of non negative curvature operators and the paper zuo 00 isolated the important point that on the kernels of kodaira spencer maps one of the two terms drops out and on these subspaces the curvature forms have a sign here the relevant bundles are constructed from the hom f p f p 1 f p 1 f p bundles and the relevant kodaira spencer maps vanish in the integrable subspaces cf proposition 2 1 in loc cit this issue is discussed below in some detail in section vi b 10 the second involves the singularities that arise both at the singular point msing m m o and at the boundary m m m of m once these are dealt with we find the following which are variants and very modest improvements of results in the literature due to zuo in zuo 00 and others cf bru 16 b for a recent paper on this general topic and den 18 for related results and further bibliography i a 24 m is of log general type and there exists an m 0 such that i a 25 symm 1 m log is big for m m 0 the precise meaning of these statements will be explained in section vi b below 19 the theme of these notes is the positivity of vector bundles especially those arising from hodge theory and some applications of this positivity to algebraic geometry above we have discussed applications of the positivity of the hodge line bundle and of the cotangent bundle at the smooth points to the image of a period mapping we next turn to an application of positivity of the hodge vector bundle to the iitaka conjecture of which a special case is i a 26 let f x y be a morphism between two smooth projective varieties and assume that i the general fibre xy f 1 y has kodaira dimension xy dimxg ii var f dimy 20 then the kodaira dimension is sub additive i a 27 x y xy this result was proved with one assumption later seen to be unnecessary by viehweg vie 83 a vie 83 b his work built on fuj 78 uen 74 uen 78 kaw 82 kaw 83 and kaw 85 and was extended by kol 87 the sub additivity of the kodaira dimen sion plays a central role in the classification of algebraic varieties and over the years refinements of the result and alternative approaches to its proof have stimulated a very active and interesting literature cf kaw 02 and the more recent papers sch 15 pa 16 it is not our purpose here to survey this work but rather it is to focus on some of the hodge theoretic aspects of the result one of these aspects is that the original proofs showed the necessity for understand ing the singularities of the chern form of the hodge line bundle here cks 86 is fundamental as noted there by those authors their work was in part motivated by establishing what was required for the proof of the iitaka conjecture in this particular discussion we shall mainly concentrate on the hodge theoretic aspect of the problem where everything is smooth the issues that arise from the 19 in fact as will be discussed there m is of stratified log general type a notion that is a refinement of log general type 20 this means that at a general point the kodaira spencer map y tyy h 1 txy is injective 11 singularities may be dealt with using theorem iv b 8 in section vi b following general remarks on what is needed to establish the result we first observe that if generic local torelli 21 holds for f x y then i a 27 is a direct consequence of theorem iii b 7 applied to the hodge vector bundle however in general the assumption xy dimxy pertains to the h 0 kmxy for m 0 not to h 0 kxy itself so the question becomes how can hodge theory be used to study the pluricanonical series h 0 kmxy 22 to address this an idea in kaw 82 was expanded and used in vie 83 b with further refinement and amplification in kol 87 it is this aspect that we shall briefly discuss here with further details given in section vi c first a general comment given a smooth variety w of dimension n and an ample line bundle l w there are two variations of hodge structure associated to the linear systems ml for m 0 a the smooth divisors d ml carry polarized hodge structures b for each s h 0 lm with smooth divisor s d ml there is a cyclic covering w s w branched over d and with a distinguished section s h 0 w s l where s m s we may informally think of b as the correspondence i a 28 w s 1 m w s s obtained by extracting an mth root of s we note that for each c there is an isomorphism i a 29 w s w s so that we should think of b as giving the smooth fibres in a family w s s ph 0 lm a variant of the construction b is then given by c w desingularization of s ph 0 lm w s ph 0 lm it is classical that a suitable form of local torrelli for the end piece of the differential of the period mapping holds for the families of each of the types a and c when 21 this means that the end piece n of the differential of the period mapping is generically injective 22 here as will be explained below we are referring to both the traditional use of the positivity of the hodge line bundle and also to the semi positivity of the hodge vector bundle which may be used in place of the concept of weak positivity introduced by vieweg vie 83 a and vie 83 b 12 m 0 cf cmsp 17 moreover the methods used to prove these results may be readily extended to show that i a 30 local torelli holds for both families of types a and c when w also varies in the case l kw there is the special feature i a 31 h 0 kmw is related to the h n 0 term of the polarized hodge structure on hn w arising in the construction c this means that setting p ph 0 kmw h 0 kmw is a summand of f op 1 where f p is the hodge vector bundle associated to the family as a consequence i a 32 h 0 kmw h 0 op 1 is a summand of h 0 f there is also a metric hodge theoretic interpretation of the pluricanonical series for h 0 kmw the narashimhan simka ns 68 finsler type norm i a 33 w 1 m has the hodge theoretic interpretation i a 34 w where the rhs is a constant times the square of the hodge length of h 0 k w the curvature properties of arising from its hodge theoretic interpretation were used by kawamata kaw 82 in in his proof of the iitaka conjecture when y is a curve the metric properties of direct images of the pluricanonical systems have recently been an active and highly interesting subject cf pa 16 for a summary of some of this work and references to the literature cf also den 18 it is possible that growing out of this work the kawamata argument could be extended to give a proof of the full iitaka conjecture we will comment further on this at the end of section vi c where a precise conjecture vi c 30 will be formulated returning to the discussion of i a 27 the essential point is to show that i a 35 f m x y has lots of sections for m 0 the idea is that positivity sections and assumptions i and ii in i a 26 f m x y has positivity as noted above when m 1 and local torelli holds using theorem iii b 7 there is sufficient positivity to achieve i a 35 the issue then be comes how to use the hodge theoretic interpretation of the pluricanonical series and semi positivity of hodge vector bundles to also produce sections of f m x y 13 if we globalize the cyclic covering construction taking w to be a typical xy we arrive at a commutative diagram that is essentially x f g x f p p y where the fibres are given by py p 1 y ph 0 mxy x y f 1 y where x y xy is the family of cyclic coverings x y xy as ph 0 mxy varies 23 if it were possible to say that from i a 31 i a 36 f m x is a direct factor of f x y then local torelli type statements would imply positivity of f m x y however due to the twisting that occurs as varies in the scaling identification i a 29 essentially what happens is that i a 37 f m x y is a direct factor of f x p p op 1 now op 1 is positive along the fibres of p y but the hoped for positivity of f m x y means that op 1 tends to be negative in the directions normal to py in p thus the issue has an additional subtlety that as will be explained in section vi c necessitates bringing in properties of the maps symk f m x p f kmx p a final question that arises is this i a 38 let f x y be a map between smooth projective varieties and assume that the locus of y y where xy f 1 y is singular is a reduced normal crossing divisor then i if det f m x y is non zero is it free ii if f m x y is non zero if it free we note that i for m 1 follows from i a 1 so far as we know ii is not known for m 1 turning to section vi d from the description following i a 14 of the satake baily borel completion m of the image m of a period mapping we may say that the extended hodge line bundle does not detect extension data in limiting mixed hodge structures one may ask whether the same is or is not the case for the extended hodge vector bundle in section vi c we give examples to show that in fact this vector bundle may detect both discrete and continuous extension data in limiting mixed hodge structures 23 see vi c 19 for the complete definition and explanation of this diagram 14 as noted above the hodge line bundle lives on the canonical completion m of the ksba moduli space for surfaces of general type interestingly as will be seen by example in a sequel to gglr 17 the hodge vector bundle does not live on m this is in contrast to the case of curves where the hodge vector bundle is defined on the moduli space mg in the final section vi e we shall revisit the exterior differential system i a 6 defined by a chern form this time for the chern form e of the line bundle ope 1 pe for a bundle e x with e 0 so that e 0 on pe the failure of strict positivity or the degree of flatness of the bundle e is reflected by the foliation given by the integral varieties of the exterior differential system e 0 the result here is proposition vi e 2 and it suggests a conjecture giving conditions under which equality might hold in the inequality e 5 n e between the kodaira iitaka dimension e and numerical dimension n e of the bundle i b general notations x y w will be compact connected complex manifolds in practice they will be smooth projective varieties e x is a holomorphic vector bundle with fibres ex x x and rank r dimex ap q x e denotes the global smooth e valued p q forms we will not distinguish between a bundle and its sheaf of holomorphic sections the context should make the meaning clear l x will be a line bundle associated to l x are the standard notions i l x ph 0 x l is the rational mapping given for x x by i b 1 l x s 0 x sn x where s 0 sn is a basis for h 0 x l in terms of a local holomorphic trivial ization of l x the si x are given by holomorphic functions which are used to give the homogeneous coordinates on the right hand side of i b 1 ii the line bundle l x is big if one of the equivalent conditions h 0 x lm cmd where c 0 dimx d and are lower order terms dim l x dimx is satisfied iii l x is free 24 if one of the equivalent conditions 24 the term semi ample is also used 15 for some m 0 the evaluation maps i b 2 h 0 x lm lmx are surjective for all x x ml x is a morphism i e for all x x some si x 6 0 the linear system ml ph 0 x lm is base point free for m 0 is satisfied if the map i b 2 is only surjective for a general x x we say that lm x is generically globally generated iv l x is nef if deg l c 0 for all curves c x here l c l ox oc is the restriction of l to c v we will say that l x is strictly nef if deg l c 0 for all curves c x for a vector bundle e x we denote the kth symmetric product by ske symk e pe x is the projective bundle of 1 dimensional quotients of the fibres of e x thus for x x pe x pe x ope 1 pe is the tautological line bundle then ope m s me gives h 0 x sme h 0 pe ope m for all m 25 i c notations from hodge theory we shall follow the generally standard no tations and conventions as given in cmsp 17 and are used in gglr 17 further details concerning the structure of limiting mixed hodge structures lmhs will be given in section iv b will denote a smooth quasi projective variety a variation of hodge structure vhs parametrized by b will be given by the equivalent data a a period mapping b d whered is the period domain of weight n polarized hodge structures v q f with fixed hodge numbers hp q and where the infinitesimal period relation ipr tb i t d is satisfied 25 the higher direct images rq ope m 0 for q 0 m r we shall note make use of this in these notes 16 b v f b where v b is a local system with gauss manin connection ob v 1 b v and f f n f n 1 f 0 is a filtration of o v by holomorphic sub bundles satisfying the ipr in the form f p 1 b f p 1 and where at each point b b the data vb f b defines a polarized hodge structure phs of weight n in the background in both a and b is a bilinear formq that polarizes the hodge structures we shall suppress the notation for it when it is not being explicitly used the parameter space b will have a smooth projective completion b with the properties z b b is a reduced normal crossing divisor z zi having strata zi i i zi with z i zi denoting the non singular points z i reg of zi and where the local monodromies ti around the irreducible branches zi of z are unipotent with logarithms ni the hodge vector bundle f b has fibres fb f nb the hodge line bundle detf hn 0 f the polarizing forms

00 form of semi stable reduction cf section 4 in gglr 17 for more details and for the notations to be used here then the canonical extension of the hodge vector bundle is given by fe f x b 17 we conclude this introduction with an observation and a question for line bundles l x over a smooth projective variety x of dimension d there are three important properties i l if nef ii l is big iii l if free and therefore it is semi ample clearly iii i and ii and iii ml gives a birational morphism for m 0 in this paper we have considered the case where l x has a metric h that may be singular with chern that defines a 1 1 current representing c 1 l the singularities of h are generally of the following types h vanishes along a proper subvariety of x h becomes infinite either logarithmically or analytically in the sense explained below along a proper subvariety of x we note that 0 as a currrent i and that in a zariski open x 0 x where h is a smooth metric d 0 ii the kodaira theorem states that if x 0 x then h is ample as discussed above in relation to the question i a 10 for a number of purposes including applications to hodge theory it would be desirable to have conditions on that imply iii ii measures of and types of positivity in this section we will i define two measures of positivity the kodaira iitaka dimension and the numer ical dimension ii define two types of positivity metric positivity and numerical positivity each of these will be done first for line bundles and then for vector bundles and the definitions will be related via the canonical association e x ope 1 pe of the tautological line bundle ope 1 pe to the vector bundle e x 26 for each of the types of positivity there will be two notions strict positivity denoted 0 and semi positivity denoted 0 for metric positivity there will be a third denoted by e 0 met 0 and l 0 met 0 respectively for vector bundles and line bundles and which means that we have 0 everywhere and 0 on an open set we also use the term strong semi positivity to mean that emet 0 and dete 0 met 0 finally 26 we will use the convention whereby pe is the bundle of 1 dimensional quotients of the fibres of e thus the fibre pex p e x 18 since metric positivity will be the main concept used in these notes in some of the later sections we will just write e 0 and e 0 0 to mean emet 0 and e 0 met 0 ii a kodaira iitaka dimension in algebraic geometry positivity traditionally sug gests sections and one standard measure of the amount of sections of a line bundle l x is given by its kodaira iitaka dimension l this is defined by ii a 1 l max m dim ml x where ml x ph 0 ml is the rational mapping given by the linear system ml if h 0 ml 0 for all m we set l from dem 12 a we have ii a 2 h 0 ml 5 o m l for m 1 and l is the smallest exponent for which this estimate holds 27 we will sometimes write ii a 2 as h 0 ml cm l c 0 we note that l dimx l x is big ii b metric positivity given a hermitian metric h in the fibres of a holomorphic vector bundle e x there is a canonically associated chern connection d a 0 x e a 1 x e characterized by the properties dem 12 a ii b 1 d d s s ds s s ds where s s a 0 x e and denotes the hermitian inner product in e the curvature e d 2 is linear over the functions hence it is pointwise an algebraic operator using ii b 1 it is given by a curvature operator e a 1 1 x ende which satisfies ee e e ee 0 where e e ex relative to a local holomorphic frame s h h is a hermitian matrix and the corresponding connection and curvature matrices are given by h 1 h e h 1 h i j ij s s dz i dz j 27 including l where we set m 0 for m 0 19 for line bundles the connection and curvature matrices are respectively log h and l log h if h e then l 0 i 2 0 is plurisubharmonic definition the curvature form is given for x x e ex and txx by ii b 2 e e e e e when written out in terms of the curvature matrix e e is the bi quadratic form i j ij e e i j the bundle e x is positive 28 written emet 0 if there exists a metric such that e e 0 for all non zero e for simplicity we will write e 0 if we have just e e 0 then we shall say that e x is semi positive and write emet 0 it is strongly semi positive if emet 0 and dete met 0 on an open set the bundle is nakano positive if there exists a metric such that for all non zero ex txx we have ii b 3 e 0 the difference between positivity and nakano positivity is that the former involves only the decomposable tensors in e tx whereas the latter involves all tensors in dem 12 a there is the concept of m positivity that involves the curvature acting on tensors of rank m and which interpolates between the two notions defined above positivity and semi positivity have functoriality properties dem 12 a for our purposes the two most important are the tensor product of positive bundles is positive and similarly for semi positive ii b 4 the quotient of a positive bundle is positive and similarly for semi positive ii b 5 the second follows from an important formula that we now recall cf dem 12 b if we have an exact sequence of holomorphic vector bundles ii b 6 0 s e q 0 then a metric in e induces metrics in s q and there is a canonical second fundamental form a 1 0 x hom s q that measures the deviation from being holomorphic of the c splitting of ii b 6 given by the metric for j q e the inclusion given by the c splitting and q qx txx the formula is loc cit ii b 7 q q e j q q 2 28 we should say metrically positive but since this is the main type of positivity used in these notes we shall drop the metrically 20 where by definition the last term is q q s and s is the induced metric in s the minus sign is because the hermitian adjoint is of type 0 1 examples i the universal quotient bundle q g k n with fibres q cn over the grassmannian g k n of k planes cn has a metric induced by that in cn and with this metric q 0 and q 0 k n 1 similarly the dual s g k n of the universal sub bundle has s 0 and s 0 k 1 geometrically for a k plane cn we have the usual identification t g k n hom cn then for hom cn and v s v 0 v 0 here the rhs means that for the infinitesimal displacement of given by we have v the picture for g 2 4 viewed as the space of lines in p 3 is v there are similar semi positivity properties for any globally generated vector bun dle since such bundles are induced from holomorphic mappings to a grassmannian and positivity and semi positivity have the obvious functoriality properties ii the hodge bundle f b with the metric given by the hodge riemann bilinear relation satisfies f 0 gri 70 but unless h n 0 1 very seldom do we have f 0 these examples will be further discussed in section iii a iii in the geometric case of a family x b with smooth fibres the narashimhan simka ns 68 finsler type metrics i a 33 in m x b have the hodge theoretic inter pretation i a 34 as a consequence there is a metric hm in opf mx y 1 whose chern form m 0 some care must both be taken here as although hm is continuous it is not smooth and so m i 2 log hm and the inequality m 0 must be taken in the sanse of currents cf dem 12 b and pa 16 metrics of this sort were used in kaw 82 and have been the subject of numerous recent works including ber 09 bpa 12 pt 14 mt 07 mt 08 and also pa 16 where a survey of the literature and further references are given 21 ii c interpretation of the curvature form given a holomorphic vector bundle e x there is the associated projective bundle pe x of 1 dimensional quotients of the fibres of e thus pe x pe x over pe there is the tautological line bundle ope 1 a metric in e x induces one in ope 1 pe and we denote by e the corresponding curvature form then e i 2 e represents the chern class c 1 ope 1 in h 2 pe since e pe x is a positive 1 1 form the vertical sub bundle v ker tpe tx to the fibration pe x has a c horizontal complement h e thus as c bundles tpe v h and h tx in more detail using the metric we have a complex conjugate linear identification e x ex and using this we shall write points in pe as x e where e ex is a non zero vector then we have an isomorphism ii c 1 h x e txx using this identification and normalizing to have e 1 the interpretation of the curvature form is given by the equation ii c 2 e e e e where txx h x e and the rhs is evaluated at x e thus ii c 3 e 0 e 0 and similarly for 0 there are the evident extensions of ii c 3 to open sets in pe lying over open sets in x for semi positive vector bundles we summarize by saying that the curvature form e measures the degree of positivity of e in the horizontal directions for later use we conclude with the observation that using ox e ope 1 given s ox x e there is the identification of 1 1 forms ii c 4 log s 2 x e x s x where the rhs is the 1 1 form e evaluated at the point x s x pe in the total tangent space both vertical and horizontal directions ii d numerical positivity in this section we shall discuss various measures of numerical positivity one main point being that these will apply to bundles arising from hodge theory the basic reference here is laz 04 a conclusion will be that the hodge vector bundle f is numerically semi positive i e fnum 0 in the notation to be introduced below 22 ii d 1 definition of numerical positivity we first recall the definition of the cone c cd of positive polynomials p c 1 cr where ci has weighted degree i for this we consider partitions 1 n with 0 5 n 5 n 1 5 5 1 5 r i n of n dimx for each such the schur polynomial s is defined by the determinant ii d 1 s c 1 c 1 1 c 1 n 1 c n n 1 c n then laz 04 c is generated over q 0 by the s it contains the chern monomials ci 11 c ir r i 1 2 i 2 rir 5 n as well as some combinations of these with negative coefficients the first of which is c 21 c 2 for each p cd and d dimensional subvariety y x we consider ii d 2 y p c 1 e cr e p c 1 e cr e y where the rhs is the value of the cohomology class p c 1 e cr e h 2 d x on the fundamental class y h 2 d x definition e x is numerically positive written enum 0 if ii d 2 is positive for all p cd and subvarieties y x we may similarly define enum 0 a non obvious result laz 04 is ii d 3 for line bundles l x we have lnum 0 l is nef the essential content of this statement is c 1 l c 0 for all curves c c 1 l d y 0 for all d dimensional subvarieties y x this is frequently formulated as saying that if l is nef then it is in the closure of the ample cone ii d 2 relation between enum 0 and ope 1 num 0 for the fibration pe x there is a gysin or integration over the fibre map h 2 d r 1 pe h 2 d x it is defined by moving cohomology to homology via poincare duality taking the induced map on homology and then again using poincare duality in de rham coho mology the mapping is given by what the name suggests the dth segre polynomial is defined by ii d 4 sd e c 1 ope 1 d r 1 23 then laz 04 i sd e is a polynomial in the chern classes c 1 e cr e and ii sd c 1 cr cd that it is a polynomial in the chern classes is a consequence of the grothendieck relation ii d 5 c 1 ope 1 r c 1 ope 1 r 1 e 1 e 1 r cr e 0 the first few segre polynomials are s 1 c 1 s 2 c 2 1 c 2 s 3 c 1 c 2 s 4 c 4 1 2 c 21 c 2 c 1 c 3 c 4 an important implication is ii d 6 ope 1 num 0 enum 0 proof by nakai moishezon cf ii g 4 below ope 1 and hence e are ample then enum 0 by the theorem of bloch gieseker laz 04 as will be noted below the converse implication is not valid ii e numerical dimension let l x be a line bundle with lnum 0 i e l is nef definition cf dem 12 a the numerical dimension is the largest integer n l such that c 1 l n l 6 0 in practice in these notes there will be a semi positive 1 1 form such that i 2 c 1 l and then n l is the largest integer such that n l 1 0 but n l 6 0 on an open set relating the kodaira iitaka and numerical dimensions from dem 12 a we have ii e 1 l 5 n l with equality if n l dimx but where equality may not hold if n l dimx example loc cit let c be an elliptic curve and p q c points such that p q is not a torsion point then the line bundle p q has a flat unitary metric but h 0 c m p q 0 for all m 0 for any nef line bundle l x we set x c x l p q l then x while n l may be any integer with n l 5 dimx 1 in section vi e we will discuss that understanding the reason we may have the strict inequality l n l seems to involve some sort of flatness as in the above example 29 for a vector bundle e x with enum 0 we have the 29 cf cd 17 a and cd 17 b for a related discussion involving certain hodge bundles 24 definition the numerical dimension n e of the vector bundle e x is given by n ope 1 since ope 1 is positive on the fibers of pe x we have r 1 5 n e 5 dimpe dimx r 1 conjecture vi e 6 below suggests conditions under which equality will hold from ii d 4 we have ii e 2 n e is the largest integer with sn e r 1 e 6 0 which serves to define the numerical dimension of a semi positive vector bundle in terms of its segre classes we remark that as noted above ii e 3 ope 1 num 0 sq e 0 for any q 0 we are not aware of results concerning the converse implication ii f tangent bundle when e tx and the metric on e x is given by a ka hler metric on x the curvature form has the interpretation ii f 1 tx holomorphic bi sectional curvature in the complex 2 plane spanned by txx when we have ii f 2 tx holomorphic sectional curvature in the complex line spanned by of particular interest and importance in hodge theory and in other aspects of alge braic geometry is the case when tx has some form of negative curvature proposition ii f 3 bkt 13 assume there is c 0 such that i tx 5 c for all and ii tx 5 0 for all then there exists such that tx 5 c 2 for all in other words if the holomorphic sectional curvatures are negative and the holo morphic bi sectional curvatures are non positive then they are negative on an open set in g 2 tx the grassmann bundle of 2 planes in tx and this open set maps onto x noting that gr 2 tx maps to an open subset of the horizontal sub bundle in the fibration ptx x from ii g 2 below we have the corollary ii f 4 if the assumptions in ii f 3 are satisfied then t x is big ii g first implications in this section for easy reference we will summarize the first implications of the two types of positivity on the kodaira iitaka dimension and numerical dimension these are either well known or easily inferred from what is known 25 case of a line bundle l x lmet 0 l ample ii g 1 this is the kodaira theorem which initiated the relation between metric positivity and sections the next is the grauert riemenschneider conjecture established by siu and de mailly cf dem 12 a and the references there ii g 2 l 0 met 0 l dimx here we recall that l 0 met 0 means that there is a metric in l x whose curvature form 0 and where 0 on an open set the result may be phrased as l 0 met 0 l is big for these notes this variant of the kodaira theorem will play a central role as bundles constructed from the extended hodge vector bundle tend to be big and perhaps free 30 but just exactly what their proj is seems to be an interesting issue because of this for later use in the case when x is projective we now give a proof of ii g 2 let h x be a very ample line bundle chosen so that h kx is ample setting f l h we have fmet 0 for d f smooth using the kodaira vanishing theorem we have hq x mf 0 q 0 hq d mf d 0 q 0 we note that the vanishing theorems will remain true if we replace l by a positive multiple let d dm h be distinct smooth divisors from the exact sequence 0 m f h mf m j 1 mf dj we have 0 h 0 x m f h h 0 x mf m j 1 h 0 dj mf this gives h 0 x ml h 0 x m f h h 0 x mf mh 0 d mf using the above vanishing results h 0 x ml x mf m d mf 30 the issue of additional conditions that will imply that an l which is nef and big is also free is a central one in birational geometry cf ko mo the results there seem to involve assumptions on ml kx in hodge theory kx is frequently one of the things that one wishes to establish properties of 26 for d dimx and letting denote modulo lower order terms from the riemann roch theorem we have x mf md d f d m d mf md d df d 1 h for m 0 this gives h 0 x ml md d f d df d 1 h o md from f d df d 1 h l h d d l h d 1 h l h d 1 l d 1 h replacing l by a multiple we may make this expression positive 31 the next result is ii g 3 lmet 0 lnum 0 and similarly for 0 obvious the inequality in ii g 3 is sometimes phrased as lmet 0 l is nef the theorem of nakai moishezon is lnum 0 l is ample ii g 4 the next inequality was noted above l 5 n l with equality if n l dimx ii g 5 case of a vector bundle e x ii g 6 emet 0 e ample and e 0 met 0 e dimx r 1 in words e 0 met 0 implies that e is big we next have ii g 7 emet 0 enum 0 this result may be found in laz 04 the proof is not obvious from the definition we are not aware of any implication along the lines of emet 0 enum 0 next we have ii g 8 e 5 n e with equality if n e dimx r 1 this follows from ii g 5 31 this argument is due to catanese cf dem 12 a 27 this leads to ii g 9 emet 0 and enum 0 e dimx r 1 this follows from ii e 2 and ii g 8 it is not the case that enum 0 e ample there is an example due to fulton of a numerically positive vector bundle over a curve that is not ample cf laz 04 we will conclude this section with a sampling of well known results whose proofs illustrate some of the traditional uses of positivity proposition ii g 10 if e x is a hermitian vector bundle with e 0 then h 0 x e 0 proof using ii c 4 applied to e x if s h 0 x e then when we evaluate log s 2 at a strict maximum point where the hessian is definite we obtain a contradiction if the maximum is not strict then the usual perturbation argument may be used proposition ii g 11 if e x is a hermitian vector bundle of rank r 5 dimx and with e 0 then every seciton s h 0 x e has a zero proof the argument is similar to the preceding proposition only this time we assume that s has no zero and evaluate log s 2 at a minimum this 1 1 form is positive in the pullback to x of the vertical tangent space and it is negative in the pullback of the horizontal tangent space the assumption r 5 dimx then guarantees that it has at least one negative eigenvalue proposition ii g 12 if e x is a hermitian vector bundle with e 0 and s h 0 x e satisfies e s 0 then ds 0 proof let be a ka hler form on x then s s ds ds s e s ds ds 0 and if dimx d using stokes theorem we have 0 x d 1 i 2 s 2 x d 1 i 2 ds ds which gives the result ii h a further result as discussed above for many purposes positivity is too strong see the examples in section ii b and semi positivity is too weak adding the trivial bundle to a semi positive bundle gives one that is semi positive one desires a more subtle notion than just e 0 with this in mind a specific guiding question for these notes has been the 28 question suppose that one has e 0 and for re dete we have dete 0 on an open set that is e is strongly semi positive does this enable one to produce lots of sections of symme for m 0 the following is a response to this question theorem ii h 1 suppose that e x is a hermitian vector bundle of rank r that is strongly semi positive then symme x is big for any m r proof setting sre symr e we have s e 0 let r be the curvature form for opsr e 1 then r 0 and we will show that ii h 2 r 0 on an open set for this it will suffice to find one point p x e 1 er psr e x where ii h 2 holds let x x be a point where tr e x 0 and let e 1 er be a unitary basis for ex then some e ei ei 0 we may assume that the hermitian matrix e ei ej ij i i 0 is diagonalized then sre e 1 er e 1 er i sre ei e 1 i er e 1 er i i 0 the same argument works for any m r using this we are reduced to proving the lemma ii h 3 let f x be a hermitian vector bundle with f 0 and where this is a point x x and f fx such that the 1 1 form f f is positive then for the curvature form f of the line bundle opf 1 pf we have f 0 at the point x f pf proof let f 1 f r be a local holomorphic frame for f x and u a 1 ar x i aif i a local holomorphic section of ope 1 pf where a 1 ar are variables defined modulo the scaling action a 1 ar a 1 ar and u a 1 ar x is holo morphic we have u 2 i j hij aia j where hij f i f j is the metric in f x up to a constant f log 2 29 we may choose our frame and scaling parameter so that at the point x f ii h 4 hij x ij dhij x 0 and x f 1 computing log 2 and evaluating at the point where ii h 4 holds any cross terms involving dhij x drop out and we obtain f ij hij x aia j i j dai d ai ai dai j ajdaj when we take the scaling action into account and use cauchy schwarz it follows that that f 0 in t x f pf remark that the point x e 1 er corresponding to a decomposable tensor in srex is very special easy examples show that we do not expect to have r 0 everywhere in fact the exterior differential system eds r 0 is of interest and will be discussed in section vi e in the situation when the curvature has the norm positivity property to be introduced in section iii a example ii h 5 we will illustrate the mechanism of how passing to sre increases the kodaira iitaka dimension of the bundle let e g 2 4 denote the dual of the universal sub bundle as above points of g 2 4 will be denoted by and thought of as lines in p 3 for v we denote by v the corresponding line in c 4 points of pe will be v s v and then the fibre of ope 1 at v is v the fibre e and we have h 0 g 2 4 e e 0 c 4 0 the tangent space t g 2 4 hom c 4 is isomorphic to the horizontal space h v t v pe as previously noted for t g 2 4 we have e v 0 v 0 ii h 6 s v here is the infinitesimal displacement of in the direction 30 we observe that ii h 7 ope 1 pe p 3 is the tautological map v v and consequently the fibre of ii h 7 through v is the p 2 of lines in p 3 through v the tangent space to this fibre are the s as pictured above we note that dimpe 5 while ope 1 n ope 1 3 points of ps 2 e are v v s v sv and unless v v we have e v v 6 0 for any non zero t g 2 4 thus for 2 the curvature form of ops 2 e 1 we have 2 0 at v v unless v v consequently s 2 e is big we shall give some further observations and remarks concerning the question posed at the beginning of this section proposition ii h 8 if e x is generically globally generated and dete is big then ske is big for some k 0 proof by standard arguments passing to a blowup of x and pulling e back we may reduce to the case where e is globally generated let n h 0 x e and denote by q g n r n the universal quotient bundle over the grassmannian we then have a diagram ii h 9 pe pq pn 1 x f g n r n where f q e ope 1 where pe 1 is the map induced by h 0 ope 1 as a metric in e x we use the one induced by the standard metric on q g n r n then we claim that e 0 tr e 0 on an open set the first of these is clear for the second detq is an ample line bundle overg n r r and dete f detq thus dete tr e 0 and for d dimx tr e d 0 31 contradicts the assumption that dete is big the proposition now follows from theorem ii h 1 this proposition will be used in connection with the following well known proposition ii h 10 if ske is big for some k 0 then there exist arbitrarily large such that sk e is generically globally generated proof as a general comment for any holomorphic vector bundle f x f is generically globally generated opf 1 pf is generically globally generated since sufficiently high powers of a big line bundle are generically globally generated and since by definition f x is big if the line bundle opf 1 is big we have f big snf x is generically globally generated taking f ske our assumption then implies that there are arbitrarily large such that s ske is generically globally generated consequently the direct summand sk e of s ske is also generically globally generated corollary ii h 11 if e 0 and dete 0 then sme is big for arbitrarily large m proof by theorem ii h 1 sme is generically globally generated and detsme 0 so that ii h 8 applies remark ii h 12 for a line bundle l x we consider the properties i l is nef ii l is big iii l is free frequently expressed by saying that l is semi ample for vector bundles e x one has the corresponding properties using o 1 in ii and iii one generally uses symmpe e rather than just e itself although all these properties are important in some sense iii is the most stable note that iii i repeating a discussion from the introduction suppose that we have in l x a hermitian metric with chern form such that ii h 13 0 and 0 on x z where z x is a normal crossing divisor then defines a ka hler metric on x x z and then as in i a 10 one may ask the ii h 14 question are there properties of the metric especially those involving its curvature r that imply that l x is free iii norm positivity iii a definition and first properties as previously noted for many purposes including those arising from hodge theory strict positivity of a holomorphic vector bundle in the sense of ii b 2 and ii b 3 is too strong whereas semi positivity is too weak the main observation of this section is that for many bundles that arise naturally in algebraic geometry the curvature has a 32 special form one that implies semi positivity in both of the above senses and where in examples the special form has hodge theoretic and algebro geometric interpretations definition iii a 1 let e x be a hermitian vector bundle with curvature e then e has the norm positivity property if there is a hermitian vector bundle g x and a holomorphic bundle mapping iii a 2 a tx e g such that for x x and e ex txx iii a 3 e e a e 2 g here we are identifying ex with e x using the metric and 2 g denotes the square norm in g in matrix terms relative to unitary frames in e and g there will be a matrix a of 1 0 forms such that the curvature matrix is given by iii a 4 e ta a we note that iii a 3 will hold for any tensors in tx e not just decomposable ones as a consequence e x is semi positive in both senses ii b 2 and ii b 3 the main implications of norm positivity will use the following observation iii a 5 if the curvatures of hermitian bundles e e x have the norm posi tivity property then the same is true for e e x and e e x as well as hermitian direct summands of these bundles proof if we have a tx e g and a tx e g then e e e ide ide e and a ide ide a tx e e g e e g leads to norm positivity for e e the argument for is evident iii b a result using norm positivity the idea is this for this discussion we abbreviate t txx e ex g gx and identify e e using the metric we have a linear mapping iii b 1 a t e g and using iii a 3 non degeneracy properties of this mapping will imply positivity properties of e moreover in examples the mapping a will have algebro geometric meaning so that algebro geometric assumptions will lead to positivity properties of the curvature the simplest non degeneracy property of iii b 1 is that a is injective this seems to not so frequently happen in practice the next simplest is that a has injectivity properties in each factor separately specifically we consider the two conditions iii b 2 a t hom e g is injective 33 iii b 3 for general e e the mapping a e t g given by a e a e t is injective the geometric meanings of these are iii b 4 iii b 2 is equivalent to having dete tr e 0 at x and iii b 5 iii b 3 is equivalent to having 0 at x e pe x this gives the proposition iii b 6 if e x has a metric whose curvature has the norm posi tivity property then i ii b 2 dete is big ii iii b 3 e is big a bit more subtle is the following result which although it is a consequence of theorem ii h 1 and iii b 3 for later use we shall give another proof theorem iii b 7 if the rank r bundle e x has a metric whose curvature has the norm positivity property then ii b 2 sre is big corollary iii b 8 with the assumptions in iii b 7 the map h 0 x sm sre sm sre is generically surjective for m 0 32 proof of theorem iii b 7 keeping the above notations and working at a general point in pe over x x given txx and a basis e 1 er of ex from iii b 3 we have iii b 9 r i 1 a ei 2 g 6 0 then using iii a 5 for the induced map a txx srex sr 1 ex gx from iii b 10 for r the canonical 1 1 form on psre at the point x e 1 er r 0 32 then this also implies that the map h 0 x sm sre smr is generically surjective 34 remark viehweg vie 83 a introduced the notion of weak positivity for a coherent sheaf for vector bundles this means that for any ample line bundle l x there is a k 0 such that the evaluation mapping h 0 x s ske l s ske l is generically surjective for 0 he then shows that for the particular bundles that arise in the proof of the iitaka conjecture if one has dete 0 on an open set and then an intricate cohomological argument gives that e is weakly positive as will be explained in section v a of these notes iii b 8 may be used to circumvent the need for weak positivity in this case we note that the ample line bundle l x is not needed in iii b 8 we also point out that emet 0 e is weakly positive cf pa 16 this is plausible since ske 0 and l 0 ske l 0 in loc cit this result is extended to important situations where the metrics have certain types of singularities we conclude this section with a discussion of the chern forms of bundles having the norm positivity property including the hodge vector bundle proposition iii b 10 the linear mapping a induces qa qt qg sqe and up to a universal constant cq q a 2 proof the notation means q a 2 qa qa where in the inner product we use the hermitian metrics in g and e and we identify qt qt q q part of 2 q t t then letting a denote the adjoint of a we have q qa qa qa qa and cq tr q qa qa in matrix terms if a dimg dimt matrix with entries in e then qa matrix whose entries are the q q minors of a where the terms of e are multiplied as polynomials 35 it follows that up to a universal constant for the hodge vector bundle f cq f a where the are q 0 forms in particular any monomial ci f 0 the vanishing of the matrix q n is not the same as rank n q in fact iii b 11 rank n q c 1 f q 0 in general we have the proposition iii b 12 if e x has the norm positivity property then p e 0 for any p c a proof of this appears in gri 69 in the geometric case when we have a vhs arising from a family of smooth varieties we have the period mapping with the end piece of differential being n tbb hom h 0 nxb h 1 n 1 xb and the algebro geometric interpretation of iii b 11 is standard e g n injective is equivalent to local torelli holding for the hn 0 part of the hodge structure we conclude this subsection with a result that pertains to a question that was raised above proposition iii b 13 if b d has no trivial factors and if hn 0 5 dimb and h 0 b fe 6 0 then chn 0 f 6 0 proof we will first prove the result when b b we let s h 0 f b and assume that chn 0 f 0 then s is everywhere non zero and we may go to a minimum of s 2 from proposition ii g 12 we have d 0 which implies that the norm s is constant and s 0 where is the gauss manin connection using the arguments gri 70 we may con clude that the variation of hodge structure has a trivial factor if b 6 b the arguments given in section iv below may be adapted to show that the proof still goes through the point is the equality of the distributional and formal derivatives that arise in integrating by parts iv singularities in recent years the use of singular metrics and their curvatures in algebraic geometry has become widespread and important here we shall discuss some aspects of this development the main objective is to define mild singularities and show that the singularities that arise in hodge theory have this property one may roughly divide singularities into three classes 36 i metrics with analytic singularities as defined in dem 12 a and pa 16 these arise in various extensions of the kodaira vanishing theorem we shall only briefly discuss these in part to draw a contrast with the next type of singularities that will play a central role in these notes ii metrics with logarithmic singularities these arise in hodge theory especially in cks 86 and also in kol 87 zuo 00 bru 16 b and gglr 17 and for those that do arise in hodge theory we shall show that they are mild as defined below iii metrics with pde singularities these arise in several places including the ap plications to moduli where important classes of varieties have canonical special metrics we shall not discuss these here but refer to the survey papers don 16 and don 15 and the bourbaki talk dem 16 for summaries of results and guides to the literature iv a analytic singularities for e x a holomorphic vector bundle over a compact complex manifold these singularities arise from metrics of the form iv a 1 h e h 0 where h 0 is an ordinary smooth metric in the bundle and is a weight function which in practice and will almost always locally be of the form iv a 2 where is plurisubharmonic psh and is smooth definition the metric iv a 1 has analytic singularities if it locally has the form iv a 2 with log m j 1 fj z j j 0 and where the fj z are holomorphic functions definition given a weight function of the form iv a 2 we define the subsheaf i ox by i f ox e f 2 here the integral is taken over a relatively compact open set in the domain of definition of f using any smooth volume form on x proposition iv a 3 nadel cf dem 12 a i is a coherent sheaf of ideals example iv a 4 dem 12 a for log z 1 1 zn n j 0 the corresponding ideal is i z 1 1 z n n j j 1 j 1 where the rhs is the ideal generated by the monomials appearing there 37 thus for j 1 and j j 2 i m 0 is the maximal ideal at the origin in cn the blow up using this ideal i is the usual blow up c n 0 cn of cn at the origin variants of this construction give powers mk 0 of the maximal ideal and using z 1 zm for m 5 n for suitable choices of the j and j leads to weighted blowups of cn along the coordinate subspaces cn m cn the use of weight functions with analytic singularities provides a very flexible analytic alternative to the traditional technique of blowing up along subvarieties example iv a 5 quite different behavior occurs for the weight function log log z 1 log zk in this case i ox we will encounter weight functions of this type in hodge theory example iv a 6 if l x is a line bundle and s h 0 x l has divisor s d we may define a metric in the line bundle by writing any local section s ox l as s fs where f is a meromorphic function and then setting s f elog f by the poincare lelong formula dem 12 a formally log s 0 but as currents the chern form is the 1 1 current l d given by integration over the effective divisor d we will be considering the case when e l is a line bundle with singular metrics of the form iv a 1 iv a 2 in this case the curvature form is given by iv a 7 h i 2 log h i 2 i 2 log h 0 for given by iv a 2 where is psh the singular part of the curvature form is the 1 1 current i 2 0 where the inequality is taken in the sense of currents as explained in dem 12 a and pa 16 theorem iv a 8 nadel vanishing theorem if h 0 in the sense of currents then hq x kx l i 0 q 0 38 application assuming that l 0 and using a cutoff function to globalize the function in iv a 4 we may replace l by ml to make i 2 kx m l 0 then the nadel vanishing theorem gives h 1 x ml ix 0 from which we infer that h 0 x ml mlx 0 thus ml is globally generated and similar arguments show that for m 0 the map ml x pnm is an embedding this proof of the kodaira embedding theorem illustrates the advantage of the flexibility provided by the choice of the weight function instead of blowing up as in the original kodaira proof the use of weight functions achieves the same effect with greater flexibility another use of singular metrics is given by the theorem iv a 9 kawamata viehweg vanishing theorem if l x is big then hq x kx l 0 q 0 proof cf dem 12 a let h x be a very ample line bundle and d h a smooth divisor from the cohomology sequence of 0 ml h ml ml d 0 and h 0 x ml md h 0 d ml d md 1 where d dimx we have h 0 ml h 6 0 for m 0 if e ml h from example iv a 6 there exists a singular metric in ml h with chern form ml h e 0 where the rhs is the 1 1 current defined by e if h 0 is the curvature form for a positively curved metric in h x then l 1 m e h 1 m h 0 and nadel vanishing gives the result remark a standard algebro geometric proof of kawamata viehweg vanishing uses the branched covering method to reduce it to kodaira vanishing the above argument again illustrates the flexibility gained by the use of singular weight functions we note that d plays a role similar to that of the branch divisor in the branched covering method 39 iv b logarithmic and mild singularities as our main applications will be to hodge theory in this section we will use the notations from section i c we recall from that section that b is a smooth quasi projective variety b is a smooth projective completion of b z b b is a divisor with normal crossings z zi where zi i i zi is a stratum of z and z i zi reg are the smooth points of zi e b is a holomorphic vector bundle a neighborhood u in b of a point p z will be u k with coordinates t w t 1 tk w 1 w we now introduce the co frame in terms of which we shall express the curvature forms in u the poincare metric in 0 t 1 is given by the 1 1 form pm i 2 dt dt t 2 log t 2 we are writing log t instead of just log t because we will want to have positive quantities in the computations below as a check on signs and constants we note the formula iv b 1 i 2 log log t 1 4 pm the inner minus sign is to have log t 0 so that log log t is defined the outer one is to have the expression in parentheses equal to at t 0 so that we have a psh function for log log t the curvature form in the trivial bundle over with the singular metric given by e has curvature form iv b 2 i 2 log e 1 4 pm remark the functions that appear as coefficients in formally computing iv b 1 using the rules of calculus are all in l 1 loc and therefore define distributions we may then compute and either in the sense of currents or formally using the rules of calculus an important observation is iv b 3 these two methods of computing give the same result this is in contrast with the situation when we take log t in which case we have in the sense of currents the poincare lelong formula iv b 4 i log t 0 40 where 0 is the dirac function at the origin anticipating the discussion below a charateristic feature of the metrics that arise in hodge theory will be that the principle iv b 3 will hold definition the poincare coframe has as basis the 1 0 forms dti ti log ti dw and their conjugates definition a metric in the holomorphic vector bundle e b is said to have logarithmic singularities along the divisor z b b if locally in an open set u as above and in terms of a holomorphic frame for the bundles and the poincare coframe the metric h the connection matrix h 1 h and the curvature matrix e h 1 h have entries that are laurent polynomials in the log ti with coefficients that are real analytic functions in u proposition iv b 5 the hodge metrics in the hodge bundles f p b have loga rithmic singularities relative to the canonically extended hodge bundles f pe b in the geometric case this result may be inferred from the theorem on regular singular points of the gauss manin connection del 70 and vi c 1 above in the general case it is a consequence of the several variable nilpotent orbit theorem cks 86 more subtle is the behavior of the coefficients of the various quantities especially the chern polynomials p f p when they are expressed in terms of the poincare frame a topic analyzed in cks 86 and where the analysis is refined in kol 87 and to which we now turn we recall that a distribution on a manifold m has a singular support sing m defined by the property that on any open set w m sing in the complement the restriction w is given by a smooth volume form a finer invariant of the singularities of is given by its wave front set 33 wf t m among other things the wave front set was introduced to help deal with two classical problems concerning distributions iv b 6 a distributions cannot in general be multiplied b in general distributions cannot be restricted to submanifolds n m for a the wave front sets should be transverse and for b to define n it suffices to have tn wf in the case of currents represented as differential forms with distribution coeffi cients multiplication should be expressed in terms of the usual wedge product of forms for restriction if n is locally given by f 1 fm 0 then for a current we first set dfi 0 i e we cross out any terms with a dfi then the issue is to 33 a good discussion of wave front sets and references to the literature is given in wikipedia we will not use them in a technical sense but rather as a suggestion of an important aspect to be analyzed for the chern polynomials of the hodge bundles 41 restrict the distribution coefficients of the remaining terms to n thus the notion of the wave front set for a current involves both the differential form terms appearing in as well as the distribution coefficients of those terms definition the holomorphic bundle e b has mild logarithmic singularities in case it has logarithmic singularities and the following conditions are satisfied i the chern polynomials p e are closed currents given by differential forms with l 1 loc coefficients and which represent p c 1 e cr e in h dr b ii the products p e p e may be defined by formally multiplying them as l 1 loc valued differential forms and when this is done we obtain a representative in cohomology of the products of the polynomials in the chern classes iii the restrictions p e z i are defined and represent p c 1 e z i cr ez i we note the opposite aspects of analytic singularities and mild logarithmic singu larities in the former one wants the singularities to create behavior different from that of smooth metrics either with regard to the functions that are in l 2 with respect to the singular metric or to create non zero lelong numbers in the currents that arise from their curvatures in the case of mild logarithmic singularities basically one may work with them as if there were no singularities at all an important additional point to be explained in more detail below is that the presence of singularities increases the positivity of the chern forms of the hodge bundles so that in this sense one uses singularities to positive effect the main result stated below and which will be discussed in the next section is that the hodge bundles have mild logarithmic singularities this would follow if one could show that iv b 7 when expressed in terms of the poincare frame the polynomials p e have bounded coefficients this is true when z is a smooth divisor but when z is not a smooth divisor this is not the case and the issue is more subtle main result theorem iv b 8 cks 86 with amplifications in kol 87 gglr 17 the hodge bundles have mild singularities the general issues iv b 6 a iv b 6 b concerning distributions were raised above since currents are differential forms with distribution coefficients these issues are also present for currents where as noted above the restriction issue iv b 6 b involves both the differential form aspect and the distribution aspect of currents this is part iii of the definition and is the property of the chern polynomials that appears in gglr 17 42 the proof of i and part of ii in theorem iv b 8 is based on the fundamental results in cks 86 with refinements in kol 87 concerning a particular multiplica tive property iv b 6 a in the definition of mild logarithmic singularities 34 and in gglr 17 the general multiplicative property and the restriction property of the chern polynomials is addressed both of these involve estimates in the factors in neighborhoods u k in b in effect these estimates may be intrinsically thought of as occurring in sectors in the co normal bundle of the singular support of the chern forms and in this sense may be thought of as dealing with the wave front sets of the these forms a complete proof of theorem iv b 8 is given in section 5 of gglr 17 in the next section we shall give the argument for the chern form c 1 detf of the hodge line bundle and in the special case when the localized vhs is a nilpotent orbit the computation will be explicit the intent is to provide a perspective on some of the background subtleties in the general argument one of which we now explain we restrict to the case when u k t 1 tk 0 tj 1 and setting tj log tj 2 i and xj log tj consider a nilpotent orbit t exp k j 1 tj nj f 0 following explicit computations of the chern form and of the chern form i for the restriction of the hodge line bundle to z i the desired result comes down to showing that a limit iv b 9 lim xj q x p x exists where q x p x are particular homogeneous polynomials of the same degree with p x 0 if xj 0 limits such as iv b 9 certainly do not exist in general and the issue to be understood is how in the case at hand the very special properties of several parameter limiting mixed hodge structures imply the existence of the limit as an application of theorems iii b 7 and iv b 8 using the notations from section i c we consider a vhs given by a period mapping b d denoting by fe b the canonically extended hodge vector bundle we have theorem iv b 10 34 the specific result in kol 87 is that the integral b c 1 dete d dimb d of the top power of the chern form of the hodge line bundle is finite this result also follows from the analysis in section v of gglr 17 43 i the kodaira iitaka dimension fe 5 2 h n 0 1 ii assuming the injectivity of the end piece n of the differential of sh n 0 fe dimpsh n 0 fe i e sh n 0 fe b is big proof it is well known gri 70 cmsp 17 that the curvature of the hodge vector bundle has the norm positivity property in fact the curvature form is given by iv b 11 f e n e 2 concerning the singularities that arise along b b it follows from theorem iv b 8 that we may treat the chern form of opfe 1 b as if the singularities were not present the linear algebra situation is iv b 12 t f g where dimt dimb dimf hn 0 and dimg hn 1 1 by iv b 11 condition iii b 2 is equivalent to the injectivity of n and theorem iv b 10 is then a con sequence of theorem iii b 7 this result gives one answer to the question the hodge vector bundle is somewhat positive just how positive is it since in the geometric case the linear algebra underlying the map iv b 12 is ex pressed cohomologically in particular cases the result i in iv b 10 can be consid erably sharpened for example in the weight n 1 case the method of proof of the theorem gives the proposition iv b 13 bru 16 a in weight n 1 i fe 5 2 g 1 and ii s 2 fe b is big proof in this case d hg where g h 1 0 and hg is the siegel generalized upper half plane we then have t s 2 v g v t v g is induced by the natural contraction map s 2 v v v for any v v the last map has image of dimension 5 g and therefore the kernel has dimension dimt g this gives i in the proposition for ii we have t s 2 v v v s 2 v s 2 v c 55 for a general q s 2 v the contraction mapping c is injective and this implies ii at the other extreme we have the 44 proposition iv b 14 let md n denote the moduli space of smooth hypersurfaces y pn 1 of degree d 2 n 4 n 3 then the hodge vector bundle f md n is big proof set v cn 2 and let p v d be a homogeneous form of degree d that defines y denote by jp k d 1 v k the jacobian ideal then cf section 5 in cmsp 17 tymd n v d j d p fy hn 0 y v d n 2 gy hn 1 0 y v 2 d n 2 j 2 d n 2 p it will suffice to show iv b 15 for general p and general q v d n 2 the mapping v d j d p q v 2 d n 2 j 2 d n 2 p is injective noting that d n 2 n 2 and that it will suffice to prove the statement for one p and q we take q x 0 xn 1 p xd 0 x d n 1 then jp x 2 n 30 x 2 n 3 n 1 and a combinatorial argument gives iv b 15 remark iv b 16 the general principle that proposition iv b 14 illustrates is this let l be an ample line bundle then both for general smooth sections y ml and for cyclic coverings x y x branched over a smooth y as m increases the hodge vector bundle f ml 0 over the open set of smooth y s becomes increasingly positive in the sense that the k such that skf is big decreases and for m 0 f itself is big v proof of theorem iv b 8 v a reformulation of the result we consider a variation of hodge structure given by a period mapping k loc d here we assume that the monodromy generators ti autq v are unipotent with logarithms ni endq v loc is the local monodromy group generated by the ti for i 1 k with complement ic 1 k i we set i t 1 tk ti 0 for i i and tj 6 0 for j i c from the work of cattani kaplan schmid cks 86 the limit limt i t is defined as a polarized variation of limiting mixed hodge structures on i passing to the primitive parts of the associated graded polarized hodge structures gives a period mapping i i loc i di 45 where di is a product of period domains and loc i is generated by the tj for j ic this may be suggestively expressed by writting lim t ti t i ti however caution must be taken in interpreting the limit as the rate of convergence is not uniform but depends on the sector in which the limit is taken in the manner explained in cks 86 we denote by k and i i the hodge line bundles the hodge riemann bilinear relations give metrics in these bundles and we denote by and i the respective chern forms the result to be proved is v a 1 lim t i i where again care must be taken in interpreting this equation in more detail this means in set dti dt i 0 for i i then the limit in the usual sense as t i of the remaining terms exists and is equal to i we will write v a 1 as v a 2 i i the proof of v a 1 that we shall give can easily be adapted to the case when the period mapping depends on parameters the limit can also be reduced to the case when is a nilpotent orbit this means that v a 3 t exp k i 1 ti ni f where f d and the conditions i n f p f p 1 ii t d for 0 t are satisfied this reduction is non trivial and is given in section 5 of gglr 17 the main points in the proof of theorem iv b 8 in the nilpotent orbit case are as follows a without changing the associated graded s to and i we may replace the f in v a 3 by an f 0 such that the limiting mixed hodge structure is r split b in this case ni can be completed to an sl 2 which we denote by n i yi ni 35 c the yi weight decomposition of nic is nic nic 0 nic 1 nic 2 where nic m has yi weight m m 0 d if all the nic m 0 for m 0 then there is an sl c 2 n ic yic nic that commutes with the previous sl 2 and the result v a 1 is immediate 35 there are two ways of doing this one is the method in cks 86 and the other one which is purely linear algebra is due to deligne 46 e in general by direct computation we have i r mod dti dt i for i i where the remainder term r consists of expressions q x p x as in iv b 9 and then direct computation using the relative filtration property and the fact that for m 0 the nic m have negative yi weights gives the result v b weight filtrations representations of sl 2 and limiting mixed hodge structures the proof of v a 1 will be computational using only that t is a nilpotent orbit v a 3 and that the commuting ni endq v have the relative weight filtration property rwfp which will be reviewed below 36 the computation will be facilitated by using the representation theory of sl 2 adapted to the hodge theoretic situation at hand the non standard but hopefully suggestive notations for doing this will now be explained i given a nilpotent transformation n endq v with nn 1 0 there is a unique increasing weight filtration w n given by subspaces v b 1 v w n k wk n v satisfying the conditions n v w n k v w n k 2 nk v w n n k v w n n k hard lefschetz property remark that the two standard choices for the ranges of indices in v b 1 are 0 5 k 5 2 n hodge theoretic n 5 k 5 n representation theoretic we will use the first of these the weight filtration is self dual in the sense that using the bilinear form q v b 2 v w n k v w n 2 n k 1 which gives v w n k v v w n 2 n k 1 the associated graded to the weight filtation is the direct sum of the gr w n v v w n v w n 1 and the primitive subspaces are defined for n by gr w n n k prim v ker nk 1 gr w n n k v gr w n n k 2 v 36 the proof in gglr 17 uses the detailed analysis of limiting mixed hodge structures from cks 86 of which the rwfp is one consequence part of the point for the argument given here is to isolate the central role played by that property 47 ii a grading element for w n is given by a semi simple y endq v with integral eigenvalues 0 1 2 n weight spaces vk v w n k for the eigenvalue k and where the induced maps vk grw n k v are isomorphisms thus v w n k k 0 v grading elements always exists and for any one such y we have y n 2 n there is a unique n endq v such that n y n is an sl 2 triple the proof of the second of these uses the first together with the hard lefschetz property of w n we denote by u the standard representation of sl 2 with weights 0 1 2 thinking of u as degree 2 homogeneous polynomials in x y we have weight xayb 2 a a b 2 n x and n y we denote by ui sym i u homogeneous polynomials in x y of degree i 1 the standard i 1 dimensional irreducible representation of sl 2 the n string as sociated to ui is xi 1 xiy yi 1 where n x the top of the n string is the primitive space given v q n as above and a choice of a grading element y for the sl 2 module vgr 2 n k 0 vk we have a unique identification v b 3 vgr n i 0 hn i ui for vector spaces hn i the notation is chosen for hodge theoretic purposes the n string associated to hn i ui will be denoted by v b 4 hn i i n hn i i 1 n n hn i and we define v b 5 the hodge theoretic weight of hn i j is n i 2 j the representation theoretic weight of hn i j is 2 j it follows that hn i i is the primitive part of the ui component of vgr relative to q the decomposition v b 3 is orthogonal and the pairing qi h n i i hn i i q 48 given by v b 6 qi u v q n iu v is non degenerate iii we recall the definition a limiting mixed hodge structure lmhs is a mixed hodge structure v q w n f with weight filtration w n defined by a nilpotent n endq v and hodge filtration f which satisfies the conditions a n f p f p 1 b the form qi in v b 6 polarizes gr w n n k prim v hn k k the mhs on v induces one on endq v and a is equivalent to n f 1 endq v we denote by vc p q ip q the unique deligne decomposition of vc that satisfies wk n v p q 5 k ip q f pv p p q ip q i q p ip q modwp q 2 n v the lmhs is r split if i p q iq p canonically associated to a lmhs is an r split one v q w n f 0 where f 0 e f for a canonical i 1 1 endq vr for this r split lmhs there is an evident grading element y i 0 0 endq vr given a lmhs v q w n f there is an associated nilpotent orbit t d t exp t n f where t log t 2 i and t t z conversely given a 1 variable nilpotent orbit as described above there is a lmhs we shall use consistently the bijective correspondence lmhs s 1 parameter nilpotent orbits since detf 0 detf without loss of generality for the purposes of this paper we will assume that our lmhs s are r split and therefore have canonical grading elements 49 iv let n 1 n 2 endq v be commuting nilpotent transformations and set n n 1 n 2 then there are two generally different filtrations defined on the vector space grw n 1 v a the weight filtration w n v induces a filtration on any sub quotient space of v and hence induces a filtration on grw n 1 v b n induces a nilpotent map n grw n 1 v gr w n 1 v and consequently there is an associated weight filtration w n grw n 1 v on gr w n 1 v definition the relative weight filtration property rwfp is that these two filtra tions coincide v b 7 w n grw n 1 v w n gr w n 1 v 37 we note that n is the same as the map induced by n 2 on gr w n 1 v so that v b 7 may be perhaps more suggestively written as v b 8 w n grw n 1 v w n 2 gr w n 1 v the rwfp is a highly non generic condition on a pair of commuting nilpotent trans formation one that will be satisfied in our hodge theoretic context v suppose now that y 1 is a grading element for n 1 so that the corresponding sl 2 n 1 y 1 n 1 acts on v and hence on endq v we observe that the y 1 eigenspace deomposition of n 2 is of the form v b 9 n 2 n 2 0 n 2 1 n 2 m m 0 where y n 2 m mn 2 m the reason for this is that n 1 n 2 0 n 2 is at the bottom of the n 1 strings for n 1 acting on endq v it can be shown that there is an sl 2 n 2 y 2 n 2 0 that commutes with the sl 2 above thus v b 10 given n 1 n 2 as above there are commuting sl 2 s with n 1 and n 2 0 as nil negative elements moreover n 2 n 2 0 terms of strictly negative weights relative to n 1 y 1 n 1 it is the strictly negative that will be an essential ingredient needed to establish that the limit exists in the main result v c calculation of the chern forms and i step 1 for a nilpotent orbit v a 3 holomorphic sections of the canonically ex tended vhs over are given by exp k j 1 tj nj v v vc 37 there is a shift in indices that will not be needed here cf vi a 13 below 50 up to non zero constants the hodge metric is u v q exp j tj nj u exp j tj n v q exp j log tj 2 nj u v using the notation v b 3 the associated graded to the lmhs as t

associated graded to the lmhs as t i we define pi n i 0 det ni h n i 0 i i i taking ni n 1 and nic n 2 in iv in section v b we have nic 0 weight zero component of nic where weights are relative to the grading element yi for ni decomposing the rhs of v c 1 using the sl 2 sl 2 corresponding to ni and nic 0 by iv b 10 we obtain v c 4 vgr i j h n i j i j ui uj where h n i j i j is a polarized hodge structure of weight n i j note that this decomposition depends on i on h n i j i j ui uj we have a commutative square hn i j i j n i i n j ic 0 h n i j i j j n j ic 0 h n i j i j i n i i h n i j i j using v c 4 this gives p i j det n iin j ic 0 h n i j i j i j r where the remainder term r involves the nic m s for m 0 we may factor the rhs to have p i j det n ii h n i j i j i j i j det n j ic 0 h n i j i j i j r which we write as v c 5 p pi pic r where pi and pic are the two i j factors we note that v c 6 the remainder term r 0 if we have commuting sl 2 s 38 we next have the important observation lemma v c 7 pic is the hodge metric in the line bundle i z i proof this is a consequence of the rwfp v b 7 applied to the situation at hand when we take n 1 ni and n 2 nic 38 to have commuting sl 2 s means that n 2 m 0 for m 0 52 by v c 6 if we have commuting sl 2 s then r 0 logp logpi ric logpic modulo dti dt i for i i i and we are done in general we have v c 8 i s 1 s 2 where v c 9 s 1 pic r r pic pic r pipic s 2 r r p 2 i p 2 ic step 3 we will now use specific calculations to analyze the correction terms s 1 s 2 the key point will be to use that n ni nic ni nic 0 m 1 nic m where the terms over the first brackets may be thought of as the commuting sl 2 part of ni nic and the correction term over the second bracket has negative yi weights we set h n i 0 i dimh n i 0 i and for a monomial m x 11 x k k we define degim i i i lemma v c 10 i for any monomial m appearing in p degim 5 nh 0 i n 1 h 1 0 i h n i 0 i n i 1 ih n i 0 i ii if is any permutation of 1 k and i n j 1 j h n j 0 1 i h n j 0 1 i 1 then m x 1 1 x 2 2 x k k x 1 k 1 x 1 k k appears with a non zero coefficient in p corollary the monomials appearing in p are in the convex hull of the monomials m 53 proof for vgr i gr w ni v we have as n i yi ni modules vgr i n i 0 hn ii ui decomposing the rhs as sl 2 modules we have vgr i n i 0 hn ia i a ua u i a where the hn ia i a depend on i the map n i hn i 0 i hn i gives i a 0 h n i 0 a i a i i a 0 h n i 0 a i a the yi weights of vectors in h n i 0 a i a are equal to a and thus hn i 0 i a 0 h n i 0 a i a i has weight ah n i 0 a i a and hn i 0 i a 0 h n i 0 a i a has weight ah n i 0 a i a as a conse quence any monomial in det n i hn i 0 i drops weights by 2 h n i 0 a i a we have v c 11 det n hn i 0 i i det ni nic 0 hn i 0 i i t where t terms involving nic neg for any monomial m in a minor involving the nic neg of total weight d 2 degim d 2 i a 0 ih n i 0 a i a d 0 and so degim i a 0 ah n i 0 a i a putting everything together we have v c 10 where v c 12 t linear combinations of monomials m satisfying degim n i 0 i a 0 ah n i 0 a i a using the bookkeeping formula h n i 0 i n i a h n i 0 a i a we obtain n i 0 i a 0 ah n i 0 a i a i a 0 n i a h n i 0 a i a n a 0 ah n a 0 i 54 which gives p pipic correction term with degi n a 0 ah n a 0 i where degi pi n a 0 ah n a 0 i and degi pic 0 giving i in v c 10 a parallel argument shows that for i j di j n i 0 det ni ni 0 h n i 0 i j i i a correction with degi m a 0 ah n a 0 i by the definition of hn ii j det ni nj 0 h n i 0 i j i i 6 0 and degi det ni nj 0 h n i 0 i j i i n a 0 ah n a 0 i while automatically degi j all terms of di j n a 0 ah n a o i j thus degj det ni nj 0 h n i 0 i j i i degi j det ni nj 0 h n i 0 i j i i degi det ni nj 0 h n i 0 i j i i n a 0 a h n a 0 i j h n a 0 i proceeding inductively on 1 1 2 1 k we obtain if n 1 0 weight 0 piece of n 1 with respect to gr w n 1 k then n i 0 det n 1 n 1 2 0 n 1 k 0 hn i 0 i is a non zero multiple of x 1 1 x 2 2 x k k this is our m tracking the correction terms we have p c m terms strictly in the convex hull of the m where c 6 0 for all this proves ii in v c 10 55 step 4 referring to v c 8 and v c 9 from lemma v c 10 we have a r 1 has degi r 1 degi pi and all monomials satisfy i in v c 10 b r 2 is a sum of products of monomials m 1 m 2 where each degim degi pi and mi satisfies i in v c 10 to complete the proof we have lemma v c 13 given a monomial m in the i variables satisfying degim degi p and ii in lemma v c 10 lim t i m pi 0 proof implicit in the lemma is that the limit exists we note that t i is the same as xi for i i we also observe that the assumptions in the lemma imply that there is a positive degree monomial m with degi m m degi pi and where m m lies in the convex hull of the m s for pi using this convex hull property we will show that v c 14 m m pi is bounded as xi for i i since limxi m x this will establish the lemma we now turn to the proof of v c 14 because the numerator and denomina tor are homogeneous of the same degree the ratio is the same for x 1 xk and x 1 xk 0 for simplicity reindex so that i 1 d suppose that x x 1 x d is a sequence of points in xi 0 i i such that lim m m x di x consider a successive set of subsequences such that for all i j we have one of three possibilities i lim x i x j ii x i x j is bounded above and below which we write as x i x j iii lim x i x j 0 39 now replace our sequence by this subsequence let ii ir be the partition of i such that i j ii holds for i j and order them so that i holds for i j i im 1 j im 2 and m 1 m 2 we may thus find a c 0 such that 1 c 5 x i x j 5 c if i j in same im and for any b 0 x i x j b m 2 m 1 if i im 1 j im 2 sufficiently large by compactness we may pick a subsequence so that lim x i x j cij if i j same im now introduce variables y 1 yd and let xi aiym if i im ai aj cij ai 0 39 in effect we are doing a sectoral analysis in the co normal bundle to the stratum i which explains the wave front set analogy mentioned above 56 we may restrict our cone by taking n m i im aini this reduces us to the case im 1 for all m i e lim x i x j if i j 40 thus for any b x i x j b j i for v 0 now xm 1 1 x m 2 2 xmd d x 1 1 x 2 2 x d d 0 if m 2 m 2 md 2 2 d and m 1 1 or m 1 1 and m 2 2 thus pi cm 1 2 d terms of slower growth as c 0 i e m 1 2 d other terms x b since m m belongs to the convex hull of the m m m m 1 2 d x is bounded as this proves the claim example v c 15 an example that illustrates most of the essential points in the argument is provided by a neighborhood 3 of the dollar bill curve with the dual graph in m 2 the family may be pictured as follows 40 in effect we are making a generalized base change d k such that for the pullback to d the coordinates ym go to infinity at different rates 57 one nodal curve on the coordinate plane two nodal curve on the coordinate axis dollar bill curve at the origin a a a a a ak smooth curve in 3 figure 1 with the picture 1 3 2 each of the coordinate planes outside the axes is a family of nodal curves where one of the vanishing cycles i has shrunk to a point along each of the coordinate axes two of the three cycles have shrunk to a second node and at the origin we have the dollar bill curve we complete the i to a symplectic basis by adding cycles i 41 1 2 the corresponding monodromies around the coordinate axes are picard lefschetz transformations with logarithms ni i i 41 here 3 is not drawn in 58 and with matrices n 1 0 1 00 1 0 0 n 2 0 0 00 1 0 0 n 3 0 1 11 1 0 0 setting as usual t log t 2 i the normalized period matrix is t t 1 t 3 t 3 t 3 t 2 t 3 holomorphic term the corresponding nilpotent orbit is obtained by taking the value at the ti 0 of the holomorphic term and by rescaling this term may be eliminated setting l t log t 4 2 and pm t i 2 logl t the metric in the canonically framed hodge vector bundle is the 2 2 hermitian matrix h t l t 1 l t 3 l t 3 l t 3 l t 2 l t 3 in the hodge line bundle the metric is h t l t 1 l t 2 l t 1 l t 2 l t 3 l t 1 l t 2 l t 1 t 2 l t 3 setting log h t log l t 1 l t 2 l t 1 t 2 l t 3 3 logl t 1 t 2 we will show that v c 16 t 3 0 is defined and is equal to 3 proof setting h h and h h we have now l t 1 l t 2 l t 2 t 2 l t 3 l t 1 l t 2 l t 1 t 2 l t 3 setting dt 3 0 the dominant term of what is left is the left hand term in l t 1 t 2 l t 1 l t 2 l t 3 l t 1 t 2 l t 1 t 1 l t 1 t 2 and the arrow means that the limit as t 3 0 exists and is equal to the term on the right for letting denote modulo dt 3 and dt 3 and taking the limit as above l t 1 t 2 l t 1 l t 2 l t 3 l t 1 t 2 l t 1 t 2 l t 1 t 2 which gives the result 59 we next observe that v c 17 3 t 2 0 is defined and is equal to zero proof the computation is similar to but simpler than that in the proof of v c 16 interpretations the curves pictured in figure 1 map to an open set 3 m 2 the phs s of the smooth curves in 3 vary with three parameters those on the codimension 1 strata such as 2 vary in moduli with two parameters their normalizations are e q p and their lmhs s vary with two parameters with gr 1 lmhs h 1 e gr 0 lmhs q and where the extension data in the lmhs is locally given by aje p q thus gr lmhs varies with one parameter and for the approximating nilpotent orbit is constant along the curves t 1 t 2 c this local fibre of the map m 2 m is part of the closed fibre parametrized by e along the codimension 2 strata such as 2 the curves vary in moduli with 1 parameter their normalizations are q p p q and the moduli parameter is locally the cross ratio of p q p q the lmhs s are purely hodge tate and thus gr lmhs has no continuous parameters in summary e is locally 1 1 on 3 e has rank 1 on 2 e is locally constant on 2 as c 0 the fibres of e on the 2 tend to the coordinate axis 2 along which e is locally constant 60 proof of theorem i a 14 in the dimb 2 case we are given b d where b b z with z zi a normal crossing divisor whose components are irreducible smooth curves around which the monodromy ti is unipotent and non trivial we may also assume that is generically 1 1 the mapping is then proper and the images m b d is a closed complex surface we want to show that m has a canonical completion to a complex analytic surface m over which the hodge line bundle over m extends to an ample line bundle e m we choose our labelling so that the lmhs is locally constant along the zi for i 1 k and is not locally constant along the remaining zj then the curves zi for i 1 m are the ones to be contracted to give m it is classical that the criterion to be able to contract the zi to normal singularities is that the intersection matrix v c 18 zi zj 1 i j 5 k 0 be negative definite since the monodromy of lmhs along zi is finite the canonically extended hodge line bundle e i zi is of finite order and moreover the canonically extended chern e may be restricted to zi and i e i zi 0 where i is the chern form of the hodge line bundle i e zi since 2 e 0 our desired result v c 18 follows from the hodge index theorem since e zi is of finite order a power of it is trivial and therefore for some m the line bundle me b descends to a line bundle m e m m although m is singular and e only descends to a singular differential form on m the classical kodaira theorem may be extended to this case to give that m e m m is ample cf section vi in gglr 17 for the details vi applications further results and some open questions vi a the satake baily borel completion of period mappings we will discuss the proof of theorem i a 14 as stated in the introduction there are three steps in the argument a construction of the completion m of m b analysis of the extended chern form e on b and c extension of the classical kodaira theorem to the case of the singular variety m where the chern form up on b has mild singularities step b was discussed in section v above and using it step c can be done by extending essentially standard arguments for this we refer to section 6 in gglr 17 and here shall take up step a what follows is not a formal proof the intent is to illustrate some of the key ideas behind the argument given in gglr 17 there are four parts to the argument 61 a 1 localize the period mapping to k loc d where loc t 1 tk is the local monodromy group and determine the structure of local image k m a 2 using the first step and the proper mapping theorem show that the fibres f of the set theoretic map e b m are compact analytic subvarieties of b and from this infer that m has the structure of a compact hausdorff topological space and e is a proper map ping a 3 define the sheaf om whose sections over an open set u m are the continuous functions f such that f e is holomorphic in 1 e u and show that om endows m with the structure of an analytic variety and a 4 show that certain identifications of connected components of the fibres that result from the global action of monodromy give a finite equivalence relation this uses cdk 95 in this paper we shall mainly discuss the first step isolating the essential point of how the relative weight filtration property enters in the analysis of how the local period mapping in a 1 extends across the boundary strata of k in k step a 2 is based on the following cf som 78 let b d be a period mapping where b b z with z i zi a normal crossing divisor with unipotent monodromy ti around zi the may be extended across all the z i zi j 6 izi zj around which ti id and the resulting mapping e be d is proper 42 thus e be d is a closed analytic variety this result will be used for b and also for the period mappings i z i i di given by taking the associated gradeds to the limiting mixed hodge structures along the strata z i zi j izj zi step a 3 which is work still in progress is based on analysis of the global structure of the fibres f specifically positivity properties of the co normal sheaf if i 2 f which is the co normal bundle n f b in case f is smooth 42 this result uses that an integral element of the ipr the holomorphic sectional curvatures are 5 c for some c 0 and the ahlfors schwarz lemma for the former we refer to theorem vi b 1 below the latter is a by now standard deep fact in complex function theory 62 turning to the discussion of step a 1 we shall only consider the key special case when 0 there are no parameters and is a nilpotent orbit v b 3 then is given by taking the orbit of the image of the homomorphism of complex lie groups c k gc whose differential is ti ti ni referring to the discussion following the statement of theorem i a 14 in the intro duction and recalled below we will prove the following proposition vi a 1 there exists a mapping k cn whose fibres are exactly the fibres of the set theoretic mapping e localized to k and with monodromy group loc cf vi a 3 below the mapping in the proposition will be given by monomials and for this reason it will be called a monomial mapping the mapping e localized to k arises from a period mapping vi a 2 k loc d given by a nilpotent orbit the corresponding variation of hodge structure over k induces variations of polarized limiting mixed hodge structures along the open boundary strata i t 1 tk k ti 0 for i i and tj 6 0 for j ic passing to the primitive parts of the associated graded gives period mappings i i i di where i is generated by the ti for i i the set theoretic mapping e is given by vi a 3 e k loc d q i i loc di where e i and i loc is the monodromy group given by the vhs over i the proof of proposition vi a 1 will be given in several steps as follows 1 determine the connected components of the nilpotent orbit vi a 4 exp j tj nj f k loc d 2 extend that argument to determining the connected components of the mappings i which will also be given by nilpotent orbits vi a 5 i ti exp j ic tj nj fi i i di 3 show that for i j the closure in i j of a fibre of i is equal to a connected component of a fibre of j and 4 show that the limit of a sequence of fibres of i is contained in a fibre of j 63 as for removing the connected component qualifiers go part of this deals with the identifications induced by global monodromy that was mentioned above the basic idea in the construction appears already in step 1 the most interesting part of the argument is step 3 where the relative weight filtration property provides the key step 1 we consider the question what are the conditions that a monomial vi a 6 tb tb 11 t bk k bi z be constant on the fibres of vi a 2 for this we let r a a 1 ak i aini 0 rk be the set of relations on the ni g 43 we note that r is defined over q proposition vi a 7 the conditions that the monomial vi a 6 be constant on the fibres of vi a 2 are a b j ajbj 0 a r proof the vector field induced by n ajnj gr is nowhere vanishing on d 44 thus on the one hand j ajtj tj is tangent to a fiber of j ajnj 0 on the other hand the condition that the monomial vi a 6 be constant on the orbits of the vector field j ajtj tj on k is j ajtj tj tb a b tb 0 this simple computation contains one of the key ideas in the construction of the monomial mapping k cn we next consider the question are there enough monomials vi a 6 satisfying a b 0 for all a r and where bj z 0 to separate the connected components of the fibres of vi a 4 this is the existence result that is needed to give local charts that will define the fibres of vi a 4 up to connected components it is a consequence of the following proposition vi a 8 the subspace r is spanned by vectors b where all bi q 0 this is a consequence of a result in linear programming known as farkas alterna tive theorem we refer to section 3 in gglr 17 for details and a reference 43 here we use the gglr 17 notations g endq v and gr endq vr 44 this is because d gr h where h is a compact subgroup of gr the lie algebra h then contains no non zero nilpotent elements in endq vr 64 step 2 we consider the period mappings vi a 5 i z i loc i di given by the variation of polarized limiting mixed hodge structures on the open smooth strata z i again restricting to the case of a nilpotent orbit vi a 5 we may ask for the analogue of the question in step 1 for this nilpotent orbit the key observations here are that here both the weight and the hodge filtrations enter and since i maps to the associated graded relative to the weight filtration w ni any operation that decreases w ni has no effect recalling from section v b our notations ni i i ni yi grading element for ni and ni yi n i is the resulting sl 2 for j ic we have nj nj 0 nj 1 where nj m is the m weight space for yi it follows that the nilpotent orbit vi a 5 is the same as the nilpotent orbit using nj 0 in place of nj and in place of proposition vi a 7 we have proposition vi a 9 the connected components of the fibres of vi a 5 are the level sets of monomials tb where bj z 0 and j ic bjnj w 1 ni g moreover recalling that the chern form of the hodge line bundle is given by i e z i these connected components are exactly the connected integral varieties of the exterior differential system i 0 we recall our notation i t k ti 0 for i i and tj 6 0 for j ic and denote by vi a 10 i i c ni the monomial map constructed in the same way as the monomial map constructed from propositions vi a 7 and vi a 8 using the tb for a generating set of vectors b r with the bi z 0 the to be constructed compact analytic variety is m is set theoretically the disjoint union vi a 11 m m q i mi where mi is a finite quotient of the union of the images i z i loc i di to complete the proof of the construction of m as compact analytic variety two issues need to be addressed 65 i set theoretically the inverse image of i i mi is a finite cover of i i and we need to describe analytic functions that will separate the sheets of this covering 45 and ii we need to show that the analytic varieties mi fit together to give the structure of an analytic variety on m step 3 for the second of the two issues above we observe that the restriction tb i 0 if bi 0 for some i i to establish ii we have the proposition vi a 12 for i j so that j i the closure of a level set of i is contained in a level set of j moreover the limit in j of level sets in i is contained in a level set of j proof this will be a consequence of the relative weight filtration property rwfp v b 7 that we now recall in a form adapted to the proof of vi a 12 given a b 1 k with a b we denote by nb nb 0 nb 1 nb 2 the ya eigenspace decomposition of nb relative to the sl 2 n a ya na then the nilpotent operator nb 0 gr w na m v grw na m v gr w na m v induces a weight filtration on grw na v another weight filtration on this vector space is defined by w na nb wm na w na nb wm 1 na the rwfp is that these two filtrations coincide i e vi a 13 wm m na nb wm na wm m na nb wm 1 na wm nb 0 gr w na m v returning to the proof of vi a 12 what must be proved is that for i j vi a 14 j ic ajnj w 1 ni j jc ajnj w 1 nj on the rhs we have used that nj w 2 nj for j j so the sum is really over j j c what vi a 14 translates into is that if ta is a monomial that is constant on the fibres of i then the restriction t a j is constant on the level sets of j we let x j ic ajnj w 1 ni g where the is because x z ni x has only negative weights in the ni string decomposition of g 45 here there is both a local issue dealing with the fibres of i i i di and a global issue arising from the possibility that two connected components of the fibre of i i i di may be subsets of a single fibre of i on z i due to the global action of monodromy 66 write x x 0 x 1 x 2 in terms of the eigenspace decomposition of yj since nj i is in the 2 eigenspace of yi we have nj i x 0 0 now decompose x 0 into yi eigenspace components x x 0 m x 0 m 1 m 1 then nj i 0 x 0 m 0 x 0 m gr w ni m g lies in z nj i 0 gr w ni m g and consequently x 0 m w 0 nj i 0 gr w ni m g applying vi a 13 with a i b j i gives vi a 14 which proves vi a 12 step 4 at this point we have constructed a monomial mapping ck cn whose fibres are unions of the fibres of the nilpotent orbit v a 3 the final local step is to refine the construction to have ck ck cn vi a 15 where is a monomial mapping with connected fibres the basic idea already occurs when k n 1 and t tm then t 1 m separates the fibres of in general we suppose that t ti 1 tin where tij t ij 1 1 t ijk k define a map zk zn by ej i 1 j inj then identifying zn with hom zn z up to a finite group the image zn is defined by zn setting for the finite abelian group we have vi a 16 z diz 67 the mapping in vi a 15 will be a to 1 monomial map to construct it at the level of exponents of monomials we will have zk b a zk a zn vi a 17 where im a im a and zk im b such a map always exists and may be constructed using vi a 16 we then use vi a 17 to define vi a 15 where is a monomial map with connected fibres for the issue arising from the global action of monodromy we refer to section 3 in gglr 17 example vi a 18 this is a continuation of example v c 15 above sincen 1 n 2 n 3 are linearly independent the mapping 3 loc d given by the corresponding nilpo tent orbit is 1 1 46 the interesting situation is on the face 0 2 given by t 1 0 there we observe from the computations in example v c 15 that the induced maps n 2 n 3 gr w n 1 1 v gr w n 1 1 v are equal this gives the relation n 2 n 3 0 which leads to the monomial t 2 t 3 that is constant on the fibres of the period mapping 1 0 2 1 loc d 1 47 on the codimension 2 strata the associated graded to the lmhs s are hodge tate so the corresponding period mappings are constant 48 we conclude this section by discussing the following question what are the zariski tangent spaces to m more precisely vi a 19 what is the kernel of the mapping tbb t e b m recalling the notation e for the chern form of the canonically extended hodge line bundle e b we want to define in each tangent space to b the meaning of the equations vi a 20 e 0 tbb the issue is that e is not smooth continuous or even bounded if b b then vi a 20 has the usual meaning 0 if b z i and tbz i is tangent to z i then since e z i i vi a 20 means that i 0 46 in this case d h 2 47 in this case d 1 h 48 we note that the limit of the parabolas t 2 t 3 c as c 0 will be the coordinate axes confirming the limit part of the statement in vi a 12 in this case 68 thus the interesting case is when b z i and is a normal vector to z i in b this amounts to the situation of a 1 parameter vhs t d t t z and vi a 20 becomes the condition vi a 21 e t t 0 0 in this case we have the proposition vi a 22 if t 6 id then e t t 0 6 0 proof if t expn is unipotent then the methods used in section v a above and section 3 in gglr 17 give for the chern form on e c dt dt t 2 log t 2 c 0 in general t is quasi unipotent and after a base change t tm we will have t d t d where t is unipotent then from dt dt t 2 log t 2 c dt dt t 2 log t 2 c 0 we may infer the proposition 49 from vi a 22 we may draw the conclusions vi a 23 i if the nj j ic are linearly independent modulo w 1 n 1 then e 0 in the normal spaces to z i ii for nilpotent orbits e 0 0 where k cn is the monomial map we comment that ii holds in the general situation in section 3 of gglr 17 where local quasi charts are constructed for arbitrary vhs over k finally we use the results of section v above and section 3 in gglr 17 to sum marize the properties of the eds vi a 20 vi a 24 a vi a 20 defines a coherent integrable sub sheaf i ob tb b the maximal leaves of i are closed complex analytic subvarieties of b c as a set m is the quotient of the fibration of b given by the leaves of i 49 it is interesting to note that the pullback of smooth forms under a branched covering map vanish along the branch locus for the poincare metric this is not the case illustrating again the general principle that in hodge theory singularities increase positivity 69 singular integrable foliations and their quotients have been introduced and studied in dem 12 b vi b norm positivity and the cotangent bundle to the image of a period mapping i statement of results let b d be a period mapping with image a quasi projective variety m d the gr invariant metric on d constructed from the cartan killing form on gr induces a ka hler metric on the zariski open set m o of smooth points of m we denote by r and r the holomorphic bi sectional and holomorphic sectional curvatures respectively theorem vi b 1 there exists a constant c 0 such that i r 5 c for all tm o ii r 5 0 for all tm o mo tm o iii for any b mo there exists a tbm o such that r 5 c 2 for all tbm o observe that using ii g 3 from bkt 13 iii follows from i and ii as a corollary to ii we have iv r 5 c 2 is an open set in tm o mo tm o we note that iii implies that this open set projects onto each factor in m o m o as applications of the proof of theorem vi b 1 and consideration of the singularity issues that arise we have the following extensions of some of the results of zuo zuo 00 and others cf chapter 13 in cmsp 17 m is of log general type vi b 2 symm 1 m log is big for m m 0 vi b 3 the result in vi b 2 means that for any desingularization m of m with m lying over m and z m m the kodaira dimension k m z dimm the result in vi b 3 means that symm 1 m log z is big for m m 0 the proof will show that we may choose m 0 to depend only on the hodge numbers for the original vhs the proof will also show that vi b 2 s m is of stratified log general type vi b 3 s sym m 1 m log is stratified big for m m 0 here stratified log general type means that there is a canonical stratification m i of m such that each stratum m i is of log general type there is the analogous definition for stratified big 70 without loss of generality using the notations above we may take m b m b and z z we shall assume this to be the case remark the results of zuo brunebarbe and others are essentially that km log and 1 m log are weakly positive in the sense of viehweg this is implied by vi b 3 the proof of theorem vi b 1 will be done first in the case vi b 4 b b and is everywhere injective it is here that the main ideas and calculations occur the singularities that arise are of the types vi b 5 a where fails to be injective e g on msing b on z b b where the vhs has singularities c the combination of a and b as will be seen below there will be a coherent sheaf i with tb i t d 50 denoting by io the open set where i is locally free there is an induced metric and corresponding curvature form for io and with the properties i ii in the theorem for io theorem vi b 1 will follow from the curvature decreasing property of holomorphic sub bundles which gives r tmo 5 io as for the singularities if we show that det io log dimb vi b 6 symm io log is big vi b 7 then vi b 2 and vi b 3 will follow from the general result if over a projective variety y we have line bundles l l and a morphism l l that is an inclusion over an open set then vi b 8 l y big l y is big we will explain how vi b 6 and vi b 7 will follow from vi b 8 for suitable choices of y l and l ii basic calculation it is conventient to use simpson s system of higgs bundles framework cf sim 92 and chapter 13 in cmsp 17 whereby a vhs is given by a system of holomorphic vector bundles ep and maps ep 1 p 1 ep 1 b p ep 1 2 2 x 50 here we are identifying a coherent sub sheaf of a vector bundle with the corresponding family of linear subspaces in the fibres of the vector bundle the coherent sheaf i will be a subsheaf of the pull back t d h of the horizontal tangent spaces to d the critical step in the calculation will be that it is integrable as a subsheaf t d h 71 that satisfy vi b 9 p p 1 0 thus there is induced ep 1 p 1 ep 1 b p ep 1 sym 2 1 b and the data p ep symk p 1 b p p for any k with k p is related to the notion of an infinitesimal variation of hodge structure ivhs cf 5 5 ff in cmsp 17 in our situation the vector bundles ep will have hermitian metrics with chern connections dp the metrics define adjoints p ep ep 1 1 b and in the cases we shall consider if we take the direct sum over p we obtain e d with vi b 9 equivalent to 2 0 the properties uniquely characterizing the chern connection together with 2 0 give for the curvature matrix of ep the expression vi b 10 ep p 1 p 1 p p which is a difference of non negative terms each of which has the norm positivity property iii a 3 cf zuo 00 and chapter 13 in cmsp 17 for a pvhs v q f we now set ep grp homq v v n 5 p 5 n where grp is relative to the filtration induced by f on homq v v at each point b of b there is a weight zero phs induced on homq v v g and e p b g p p with the bracket ep eq ep q thinking of as an element in g 1 b the integrability condition vi b 9 translates into vi b 11 0 we shall use the notation grp grp homq v v rather than ep for this example the differential of gives a map tb gr 1 definition i gr 1 is the coherent subsheaf generated by the sections of gr 1 that are locally in the image of over the zariski open set where is injective for a section of i we denote by ad the corresponding section of gr 1 the integrability condition vi b 11 then translates into the first part of the 72 proposition vi b 12 i is a sheaf of abelian lie sub algebras of p grp for sections of i gr 1 ad 2 proof for gr 1 the curvature formula vi b 10 is gr 1 ad 2 ad 2 the result then follows from ad 0 for i on the open set where io is a vector bundle with metric induced from that on gr 1 we have io 5 gr 1 5 0 the first term is the holomorphic bi sectional curvature for the indued metric on b to complete the proof of theorem vi b 10 we need to show the existence of c 0 such that for all of unit length vi b 13 ad c the linear algebra situation is this at a point of b we have v p q n v p q and is given by maps ap v p q v p 1 q 1 n 1 2 5 p 5 n in general a linear map a e f between unitary vector spaces has principal values i defined by aei ifi i real and non zero where ei is a unitary basis for kera and fi is a unitary basis for ima the square norm is a 2 tra a i 2 i we denote by p i the principal values of ap the p i depend on and the square norm of as a vector in tpb t p d is 2 p i 2 p i in the above we now replace v by homq v v and use linear algebra to determine the principal values of ad these will be quadratic in the p i s and then ad 2 73 will be quartic in the p i a calculation gives vi b 14 ad 2 p i ap 4 p i i 2 p i 2 where the ap are non negative integers that are positive if ap 6 0 and from this by an elementary algebra argument we may infer the existence of the c 0 in theorem vi b 1 at this point we have proved the theorem the basic idea is very simple for a vhs the curvature vi b 10 of the hodge bundles is a difference of non negative terms each of which is of norm positivity type where the a in def inition iii a 3 is a kodaira spencer map or its adjoint for the homq v v variation of hodge structure a 0 by integrability conse quently the curvature form has a sign and a linear algebra calculation gives the strict negativity i 5 c 4 for some c 0 51 iii singularities the singularity issues were identified in vi b 5 and we shall state a result that addresses them the proof of this result follows from the results in cks 86 as extended in gglr 17 kol 87 and the arguments in zuo 00 52 using the notations introduced in ii above a key observation is that the differ ential tb gr 1 extends to tb z gr 1 e where tb z 1 b logz and gr 1 e is the canonical extension to b of gr 1 b this is just a reformulation of the general result cf cmsp 17 that for all p p ep ep 1 b extends to vi b 15 pe e p e e p 1 e 1 b logz as noted above the image tb gr 1 generates a coherent subsheaf i gr 1 and from vi b 15 we may infer that i extends to a coherent subsheaf ie gr 1 e as in zuo 00 we now blow up b to obtain a vector sub bundle of the pullback of gr 1 and note that ie gr 1 e will be an integrable sub bundle the metric on gr 1 induces a metric in i and we use the notations chern form of det io chern form of opio 1 theorem vi b 16 both and extend to closed 1 1 currents e and e on b and pi e that respectively represent c 1 det i e and c 1 opi e 1 they have mild singularities and satisfy 51 this first proof of the result that appeared in the literature was lie theoretic where the metric on g was given by the cartan killing form as will be illustrated below the above direct algebra argument is perhaps more amenable to the computation in examples 52 these arguments have been amplified at a number of places in the literature cf vz 03 and pa 16 74 e 0 and e 0 on an open set e 0 and e 0 on an open set with one extra step this result follows from singularity considerations similar to those in section iv above the extra step is that ie is not a hodge bundle but rather it is the kernel of the map 1 gr 1 e gr 2 e 1 e 1 b logz as was noted in zuo 00 either directly or using 5 20 in kol 87 we may infer the stated properties of e and e remark it is almost certainly not the case that any sub bundle g gr 1 e will have chern forms with mild singularities the bundle ie is special in that it is the kernel of the map gr 1 e gr 2 e 1 b logz although we have not computed the 2 nd fundamental form of ie gr 1 e for reasons to be discussed below it is reasonable to expect it to also have good properties the issue of the curvature form of the induced metric on the image m b d seems likely to be interesting since the metric on the smooth points m o m is the ka hler metric given by the chern form of the augmented hodge line bundle the curvature matrix of tm o is computed from a positive 1 1 form that is itself the curvature of a singular metric in the 1 parameter case the dominant term in is the poincare metric pm dt dt t 2 log t 2 and the curvature of the pm is a positive constant times pm one may again suspect that the contributions of the lower order terms in are less singular than pm this issue may well be relevant to question i a 10 iv examples on the smooth points of m o of the image of a period mapping the holomorphic bi sectional curvature satisfies vi b 17 r 5 0 and for in an open set in tm o mo tm o it is strictly negative this raises the interesting question of the degree of flatness of t m o in the classical case when d is a hermitian symmetric domain and b d is compact this question has been studied by mok mok 87 and others in case b is a shimura variety the related question of the degree of flatness of the extended hodge bundle fe over a toriodal compactification of d is one of current interest cf bru 16 a bru 16 b and the references cited there this issue will be further discussed in section vi e here we shall discuss the equation i 0 0 over the smooth locus m o of m in view of vi b 10 this equation is equivalent to ad 0 i to compute the dimension of the solution space to this equation we use the duality ker ad im ad 75 to have vi b 18 dim ker ad dim coker im ad gr 0 gr 1 since i depends on the particular vhs at least as a first step it is easier to study the equation vi b 19 ad 0 gr 1 because the curvature form decreases on the sub bundle i gr 1 over m o we have vi b 18 vi b 19 but in general not conversely example 1 for weight n 1 with h 1 0 g with a suitable choice of coordinates the tangent vector is given by g g symmetric matrix a and on gr 1 we have vi b 20 dim ker ad g rank a 1 2 proof at a point we may choose a basis for that q 0 ig ig 0 and f 1 is given by ig im 0 gr 1 is given by 0 a 0 0 a ta gr 0 is given by c 0 0 tc then 0 ac tca 0 0 diagonalizing a and using vi b 18 we obtain vi b 20 example 2 for weight n 2 is given by a h 2 0 h 1 1 matrix we will show that on gr 1 vi b 21 dim ker ad h 2 0 rank a h 1 1 rank a 76 proof we may choose bases so that q diag ih 2 0 ih 1 1 ih 2 0 and f 2 is given by 0 i non singular is given by 0 a 00 0 ta 0 0 0 is given by c 0 00 d 0 0 0 tc then 0 ac da 00 0 tad t ac 0 0 0 choosing bases so that a i 00 0 c c 11 c 12 c 21 c 22 and d d 11 d 12 td 12 d 22 we have ac da c 11 d 11 d 12 0 td 12 0 setting rk e ranke for a matrix e this gives rk a h 2 0 rk a rka h 1 1 rk a 0 where the s are arbitrary as in the n 1 case we note that vi b 22 a of maximal rank ker ad 0 example 3 associated to a several parameter nilpotent orbit exp i ti ni f is a nilpotent cone n ini i 0 and the weight filtration w n is independent of n as discussed in section 2 of gglr 17 without loss of generality in what follows here we may assume that the lmhs associate to n is r split thus there is a single y gr 0 homq v v such that for any n y n 2 n 77 and using the hard leftschetz property nk gr w n n k v grw n n k v we may uniquely complete y n to an sl 2 n y n let g end grw n v be the lie algebra generated by the ni and y the properties of this important lie algebra will be discussed elsewhere here we only note that g is semi simple and that the nilpotent orbit gives a period mapping k loc d where d g r h is a mumford tate sub domain of d of interest are the holomorphic bi sectional curvatures of k we shall not completely answer this but shall give a proof of the proposition vi b 23 i n 0 for all n if and only if z g proof we denote by gc p gp p the hodge decomposition on the associated graded to the limiting mixed hodge structure defined by the hodge metric is given on gc by the cartan killing form and its restriction to g 1 1 is non degenerate 53 the decomposition of gc into n strings for the sl 2 given by n y n is orthogonal with respect to the hodge metric from which we may infer that the adjoint adn acts separately on each n string the picture is something like n jj n hh n hh because n is an isomorphism the same is true of n consequently i n 0 belongs to an n string of length 1 and this implies that y n 0 by varying n over we may conclude the proposition example 4 one of the earliest examples of the positivity of the hodge line bundle arose in the work of arakelev ara 71 for 1 parameter families it gives an upper bound on the degree of the hodge line bundle in terms of the degree of the logarithmic canonical bundle of the parameter spaces 54 this result has been extended in a number of directions we refer to cmsp 17 section 13 4 for further general discussion and references to the literature one such extension is due to zuo 00 vz 03 and vz 06 this proof of that result centers around the above observation that the curvature of hodge bundles has a sign on the kernels of kodaira spencer mappings there is a new ingredient in the argument that will be useful in other contexts and we shall now explain this as above there are singularity issues that arise where the differential of fails to be injective these may be treated in a similar manner to what was done above and for simplicity of exposition and to get at the essential new point we shall assume 53 the decomposition of gc into the primitive sub spaces and their images under powers of n depends on the particular n the hodge metric on g 1 1 is only definite on the subspaces arising from the primitive decomposition for such an n 54 using the above notations the logarithmic canonical bundle of the parameter space is kb z 78 that is everywhere injective and that the relevant kodaira spencer mappings have constant rank the basic arakelev type inequality then exists at the curvature level for a varia tion of hodge structure v q f over b with a completion to b with z b b a reduced normal crossing divisor the inequality is vi b 24 curvature of det grp v 5 cp curvature of det 1 b logz where cp is a positive constant that depends on the ranks of the kodaira spencer mappings here we will continue using the notations vi b 25 grp v f pv f p 1 v grp v grp 1 v 1 b logz the second of these was denoted by p above we shall drop the p here but note that below we shall use to denote the th iterate of proof of vi b 24 using the integrability condition vi b 9 the iterates of vi b 25 give grp v grp sym 1 b logz we use the natural inclusion sym 1 b logz 1 b logz and consider this map as giving vi b 26 grp v grp v 1 b logz there is a filtration ker ker 2 ker p 1 grp v and grp v has graded quotients ker ker 2 ker grp v ker p the crucial observation and what motivates the above use of rather than sym is ker ker 1 grp 1 v 1 b logz lies in kp 1 1 1 b logz where kp 1 ker grp 1 v grp 1 b logz vi b 27 from this we infer that i kp kp 1 ko all have negative semi definite curvature forms 79 ii ker ker 1 kp 1 1 1 b logz which gives iii det ker ker 1 dp kp 1 1 1 b logz using iv det grp v p 1 1 det ker ker 1 and combining iv iii and ii at the level of curvatures gives vi b 24 note in ggk 08 there are results that in the 1 parameter case express the error term in the arakelov inequality by quantities involving the ranks of the kodaira spencer maps and structure of the monodromy at the singular points vi c the iitaka conjecture one of the main steps in the general classification theory of algebraic varieties was provided by a proof of the iitaka conjecture an important special case of this conjecture is the theorem vi c 1 let f x y be a morphism between smooth projective varieties and assume that i var f dimy i e the kodaira spencer maps are generically 1 1 ii the general fibre xy f 1 y is of general type then the kodaira iitaka dimensions satisfy vi c 2 x xy y as noted in the introduction this result was proved with one assumption later seen to not be necessary by viehweg vie 83 a vie 83 b and in general by kolla r kol 87 the role of positivity of the hodge vector bundle had earlier been identified in fuj 78 kaw 81 kaw 83 kaw 85 and ueno uen 74 uen 78 over the years there has been a number of interesting results concerning the positivity of the hodge vector bundle and in the geometric case the positivity of the direct images of the higher pluricanonical series cf pt 14 and also pa 16 and sch 15 for recent results and a survey of some of what is known together with further references to establish vi c 2 one needs to find global sections of mx from h 0 mx h 0 f m x and f m x f m x y m y the issue is to find sections of f m x y if for example f m x y is generically globally generated then we have at least approximately h 0 mxy h 0 my sections of f m x which leads to the result 80 to find sections of f m x y if for example sym m f x y has sections then since the multiplication mapping vi c 3 symm f x y f mx y is injective on decomposable tensors we get sections of the image in general the issue is to find sections of symm f m x y and use an analogue of vi c 3 the arguments in vie 83 b kol 87 have two main aspects i the use of hodge theory ii algebro geometric arguments using viehweg s notion of weak positivity in the works cited above hodge theory is used to show that under the assumptions in vi c 1 for m 0 we have det f m x y dimy from this one wants to infer that symm f m x y has sections for m m 0 this is where ii comes in the objectives of this section are twofold one is to show that in case local torelli holds for f x y step ii may be directly circumvented by using the special form f ta a of the curvature in the hodge vector bundle where a has algebro geometric meaning that leads to positivity properties 55 the other is to dis cuss viehweg s branched covering construction which provides a mechanism to apply the positivity properties of the hodge vector bundle to the pluri canonical series one issue has been that the assumptions i ii plus viehweg s branched covering method give vi c 4 det f m x y dimy from this one wants to show that vi c 5 det f m x y m has lots of sections symm f m x y has lots of sections the viehweg kolla r method proves vi c 4 using the positivity properties of the hodge line bundle and from this goes on to infer vi c 5 by an algebro geometric argument involving vieweg s concept of weak positivity for a coherent sheaf 56 the positivity of the hodge vector bundle does not enter directly we will give a four step sketch of the proof of theorem vi c 1 one that avoids the use of weak positivity the first three steps follow from the discussions above the fourth step uses a variant of viehweg s argument to derive hodge theoretic information from the pluri canonical series together with iii b 7 and iii b 8 55 as noted above a is the end piece of the differential of the period mapping 56 the definition for a vector bundle was recalled above 81 step one already noted above suppose that the fibres of x f y are smooth and that n is injective at a general point then by theorem iii b 1 symh n 0 f x y dimpf x y 1 dimy step two this is the same as step one but where we allow singular fibres what is needed to handle these follows from the discussion in section iv b reformulation of step two we set sk symk and fe f x y k curvature form of opskfe 1 where k is the 1 1 form computed using the induced hodge metric in s kf then k 0 in the vertical tangent space to a general fibre of pskfe y using the injectivity of the kodaira spencer map tyy hom f ny f n 1 y f n y at a general point y y from theorem iii b 1 it follows that for all k hn 0 vi c 6 k 0 in the horizontal space at a general point in pskfe y this gives 0 in an open set in pskfe which implies that opskfe 1 is big this in turn implies the same for s kfe step three since skf x y is big s skf x y is generically globally generated for 0 it follows that the direct summand sk f x y is generically globally generated for 0 since sk f x y f k x y is injective on decomposable tensors we obtain at least approximately h 0 k xy h 0 k y sections of k x remark vi c 7 in the geometric case an alternative geometric argument that skf x y is big may be given as follows first for a family w g y with smooth general fibre wy g 1 y the condition iii b 3 for bigness of g w y is i for general y y the kodaira spencer map y tyy h 1 twy should be injective ii for general g w y y h 0 nwy the map h 1 twy h 1 n 1 wy should be injective on the image y tyy h 1 twy 82 next for a famliy x y with generically injective kodaira spencer mappings we set w x k y y x then h 0 nw contains k h 0 nx as a direct summand and the same argument as in the proof of theorem iii b 7 gives that k f x y is big finally we may apply a similar argument to a desingularization of the quotient of w y by the action of the symmetric group then the general fibre is x k y desingularization of sym kxy with skh 0 nxy direct summand of h 0 n x k y and again the argument in the proof of theorem iii b 7 will apply step four the idea is to apply the reformulation of step two with f m x y replacing f x y this will be discussed below in which the pluricanonical series of a smooth variety will be seen to have hodge theoretic interpretations 57 an alternate more direct approach would be to have a metric in opskf mx y 1 whose chern form is positive in the space at a general point of pskf mx y for this approach to work one would need to have a metric in f m x y that has a property analogous to that obtained using the kodaira spencer map in the case m 1 considered above here one possibility might be to use the relative bergman kernel metrics that have appeared from the recent work of a number of people cf pt 14 and the references cited therein this possibility will be discussed further at the end of section vi c before giving the detailed discussion we will give some general comments a a guiding heuristic principle is vi c 8 for families f x y of varieties of general type the f k x y become more positive as k increases the reasons are 57 an alternative approach to the iitaka conjecture which replaces the use of hodge theory by vanishing theorems and also uses the cyclic covering trick has been used by kolla r ann of math 123 1986 11 42 the relation between vanishing theorems and hodge theory is classical dating to kodaira spencer and akizuki nakano in the 1950 s as noted by a number of people hodge theory in some form and the curvature properties of the hodge bundles seem to generally be lurking behind the positivity of direct images of pluricanonical sheaves 83 f x y 0 by hodge theory and skf x y becomes more positive with k by the argument in the proof of theorem iii b 7 the map s f k x y f k x y is non trivial since it is injective on decomposable tensors similar to the proof of clifford s theorem passing to the quotient increases positivity curvatures increase on quotient bundles b in what follows we will without comment make simplifying modifications by replacing f x y by f x y where all the varieties are smooth and where y y is an isomorphism outside a codimension 2 subvariety of y x is a desingularization of x y y and f is flat the fibres x y f 1 y are smooth outside a normal crossing divisor in y around which the local monodromies are unipotent vie 83 b page 577 c we now recall the two constructions from the introduction that associate to f m x y a variation of hodge structure these constructions will be done first for a fixed smooth w and then for a family f x y where w is a typical general fibre xy the objectives are to illustrate how pluricanonical series can give rise to hodge structures i the case of fixed w hodge structures associated to h 0 kmw we summarize and establish notation for the standard construction of a cyclic covering w w associated to h 0 kmw whose divisor mkx is smooth the construction is vi c 9 w kw total space of the line bundle w w where w w kw w m w then the direct image vi c 10 kw m 1 i 0 km iw which gives vi c 11 h 0 k w m 1 i 0 h 0 km iw in this way pluri differentials on w become ordinary differentials on w this is the initial step in the relation between the pluricanonical series and hodge theory 84 we observe that the cyclic group gm acts on w w with the action by e 2 i m on h 0 k w and by i 1 on h 0 km ix in vi c 11 we also observe the diagram w w w w vi c 12 induced by scaling the action of c on kw w in vi c 9 the isomorphism in vi c 12 depends on the choice of 1 m we denote by h 0 kmw 0 h 0 kmw the s with smooth divisor and we set p 0 ph 0 kmw 0 p h 0 kmw then h 0 op 1 h 0 kmw and the identity gives a canonical section vi c 13 h 0 w p kmw op 1 definition is the universal divisor of the s for h 0 kmw to construct a universal family of cyclic coverings w w it is necessary to choose an auxiliary cyclic covering p q p with q op 1 l m for an ample line bundle l p from w p id g w p we obtain h 0 w p kmw l m h 0 w p kw l m and using the pullback to w p of in vi c 13 there is a cyclic covering w w p h w p branched over the universal divisor and depending on the choice of p p in this way the choice of isomorphisms in vi c 12 necessitated by choosing an mth root of may be made uniform we observe that vi c 14 h 0 k w p m p setting w 0 h 1 w p 0 the total space and the fibres of w 0 p 0 are irreducible and smooth this gives a period mapping or equivalently a vhs vi c 15 p 0 d 85 proposition vi c 16 the hodge vector bundle f m 1 i 0 h 0 km iw l i 1 arguments as in sections 1 4 1 7 of vie 83 b show that for m 0 local torelli holds for the period mapping vi c 15 in fact we have the proposition vi c 17 for m 0 the part n t p 0 hom h 0 kmw l f n 1 f n of the end piece of n is injective this is proved by showing that is injective on certain of the eigenspaces for the g equivariant action in the picture and that the eigenspace is among those that are included discussion of singularities for h 0 kmw the finsler type norm w 1 m w is equal to the square of the hodge length of 1 m h 0 k w even when the divisor acquires singularities so that w becomes singular the hodge length of the canonical section will remain finite however although is continuous in it is not smooth as its derivatives detect singularities of the degenerating hodge structures 58 in terms of limiting mixed hodge structures lies in the lowest possible weight part the second method of associating hodge theoretic data to the pluricanonical series h 0 kmw is the following let w be a desingularization of a completion of w 0 and w p the resulting fibration if dim w n then h n w has a polarized hodge structure the general hodge theory of maps such as is contained in the decomposition theorem dcm 09 in the case at hand a special feature arises in that from proposition vi c 16 we may infer that vi c 18 h n 0 w contains as a direct summand m 1 i 0 h 0 km iw h 0 op ni here the ni 0 are determined by the i 0 in q l i 1 op i 58 norms of this type appear in ns 68 and have been used extensively in the recent literature cf pa 16 for a summary and survey 86 ii the case of a family f x y hodge structures associated to f mx y the following is a sketch of the proof of theorem vi c 1 it is intended to point out some of the geometric aspects of the arguments in vie 83 b in particular the way in which the hodge theoretic interpretations enter into those arguments referring to that paper for the details since the publication of vie 83 b several important general results concerning the pluricanonical series have been established cf dem 12 a and we shall assume the following for general y y xy is smooth and there is an such that for all m k k 1 the linear system mkxy is ample whenever an m appears below it will be of this form and the assumptions to have local torelli in the form used in vie 83 b are satisfied for f m x y the basic diagram is x f x 2 h x 1 h x f p g p q p p y vi c 19 where p pf mx y so that p op 1 f m x y is the dual of f m x y x 1 x y p p q p is a cyclic branched covering where there is an ample line bundle l p with q op 1 l m x 2 x 1 p p and x x 2 is the cyclic covering obtained by globalizing the construction of w w p given by the completion of w 0 in vi c 14 above the players in the basic diagram are f 1 y xy p 1 y ph 0 mxy whose points are where h 0 mxy q 1 i where i q under the cyclic covering is the tautological section of m x 1 p h op 1 is the tautological section of m x 2 p h lm x 2 p h l m x x 2 is the m sheeted cyclic covering obtained by extracting an mth root of 87 we will denote the fibre over y of x y by vi c 20 x y ph 0 m xy x y where xy corresponds to w and x y to w above there are two families of varieties constructed from the basic diagram denoting the composition q g f by g for the first we have vi c 21 g x p whose fibre over y p is x y the second is vi c 22 f x y whose fibre over y y is the variety vi c 20 there are two important observations concerning these families generic local torelli holds for both families and vi c 23 the basic diagram vi c 19 is commutative vi c 24 the fibres of g x p are given by g x p y h 0 x y from vi c 23 we have vi c 25 g x p 0 and detg x p 0 on an open set from vi c 25 we have vi c 26 for k 0 both skg x p and s kf x y are big to complete the proof of theorem vi c 1 the argument one first might try to make is this h 0 mxy is a direct factor of h 0 x y and from the commutativity of the basic diagram vi c 19 it follows that f m x y is a direct factor of the hodge vector bundle associated to the family x y by the local torelli property vi c 23 with the implication vi c 26 it follows that skf m x y is big however this argument is not correct the issue is more subtle the problem is that under the mapping x h x 1 in vi c 19 we do not have h x p m 1 i 0 m i x 1 p but rather h x p m 1 i 0 m i x 1 p h op i 1 88 where the op i 1 s reflect the global twisting of the identification vi c 10 this would not be an issue if op 1 were positive this positivity trivially holds along the fibres of p y but since p op 1 f m x y any positivity of f m x y becomes negativity of op 1 in directions normal to fibres of p y an additional step is required the key observation is that cf vie 83 b page 587 for a 0 ma a 1 x 1 p h op a is a direct summand of g a 1 x p it is the additional factor of a 1 in ma a 1 x 1 p that offsets the negativity of op a in the normal direction of the fibres of p y thus what needs to be shown is vi c 27 skg a 1 x p is big for k 0 this follows from vi c 27 if we have sa 1 g x p g a 1 x p 0 and this may be accomplished generically in y by choosing m 0 remark vi c 28 we conclude with a comment and a question the comment is that perhaps the most direct way to prove the iitaka conjecture vi c 2 would be to use the curvature properties of the finsler type metric in f m x y specifically referring to ber 09 bpa 12 and pt 14 for details we set p p f mx y then op 1 y has fibres vi c 29 op 1 y h 0 mxy h 0 mxy and op 1 f m x y following kaw 82 and pt 14 we define a metric in op 1 by taking the infinimum of the s where h 0 mxy projects to a fixed vector in the quotient vi c 29 leaving aside the question of singularities for this metric the form m satisfies m 0 we do not expect to have m 0 in an open set in p this is already not the case when m 1 instead we carry out a similar construction replacing f m x y by sm f m x y and denote by m m the chern form of the corresponding o 1 bundle question assuming var f dimy for m 0 do we have m m 0 in an open set this is true when m 1 and if it holds for general m and the issue of singularities can be handled one would have a direct curvature proof of vi c 2 in fact heuristic reasoning suggests the following 89 conjecture vi c 30 under the assumptions in theorem vi c 1 let m 1 be such that for general y y the bundle kmxy is globally generated then for pm xy h 0 kmxy symm f m x y is big for m pm xy vi d the hodge vector bundle may detect extension data proposition vi d 1 on a subvariety y z i along which the period mapping i is locally constant the extended hodge bundle fe i y is flat it may however have non trivial monodromy proof fe i is filtered by w ni fe i for vi the local system corresponding to i z i i di the gauss manin connection acting on oz i vi preserves w ni and on the associated graded to w ni vi it preserves the associated graded to w ni fe i it follows that preserves fe i oy v example vi d 2 on an algebraic surface s suppose we have a smooth curve c of genus g c 2 and that through each pair of distinct points p q c there is a unique rational curve meeting c at two points c p 1 p q suppose moreover that along the diagonal d c c the p 1 becomes simply tangent then c p 1 is a nodal curve and for m 0 the pluricanonical map given by m c p 1 contracts the p 1 and we obtain an irreducible stable curve cp q with arithmetic genus pa cp q 3 p q as p 1 becomes tangent we obtain a cusp the extension data for the mhs is given cf car 80 by aj c p q j c when we turn around p q we interchange p q after base change t t 2 the extension class is well defined locally globally it is another story the vector space h 0 cp q which is the fibre of the canonically extended hodge bundle has the 2 dimensional fixed subspace h 0 1 c and variable 1 dimensional quotient represented by a differential of the third kind p q h 0 1 c p q having non zero residues at p q as p q the differential p q tends to a differential of 90 the second kind 2 p h 0 c 2 p with non zero polar part at p for the global monodromy over y c c d the extension class is given for h 0 1 c by q p modulo periods the action of 1 y on h 1 c p q may then be shown to give an infinite subgroup of h 1 c z which implies the assertion claim vi d 3 the hodge vector bundle may detect continuous extension data here continuous extension data means the extension classes that arise in the induced filtration of fe y where there is a variation of limiting mixed hodge structure over y with fe the hodge vector bundle example vi d 4 we let c be a smooth curve with g c 2 and p c a fixed point we construct a family cq p c of stable curves as follows for q 6 p we identify p q p q c cq for p q we obtain a curve e p r c vi d 5 in this way we obtain a vmhs parametrized by c and with trivial monodromy for the filtration on the canonically extended hodge bundle there is a fixed part w 1 n f 1 e h 0 1 c and a variable part whose quotient is w 2 n f 1 e w 1 n f 1 e c p q for q 6 p c e r for q p the notation means that e r is the differential of the third kind on the normalization of e and with residues at 1 at the two points over the node since there is no monodromy we may normalize the p q and e r 91 combining the above we have over c an exact sequence 0 h 0 1 c o c fe oc 0 with non trivial extension class e identity h 1 o c h 0 1 c vi e the exterior differential system defined by a chern form in this sec tion we will discuss the exterior differential system vi e 1 0 defined by the chern form of the line bundle ope 1 where e x is a hermitian vector bundle whose curvature has the norm positivity property iii a 1 without assuming the norm positivity property this type of eds has been previously studied in bk 77 and som 59 and also appeared in kol 87 here our motivation is the following question vi e 2 under what conditions can one say that the kodaira iitaka dimension of e x is equal to its numerical dimension proposition vi e 3 the exterior differential system vi e 1 defines a foliation of pe by complex analytic subvarieties w pe with the properties i w meets the fibres of pe x transversely thus w w is an e tale map ii the restriction e w is flat proof since 0 on the fibres of pe x the vectors t x e pe that satisfy 0 project isomorphically to tx the image of these vectors is the subspace here identifying with vi e 4 txx a e 0 this is the same as the subspace of txx defined by e e 0 which implies that e w is flat remark given any holomorphic bundle map vi e 5 a tx e g if we have a metric in e x we may use it to identify e e and then define the horizontal sub bundle h tope 1 it follows that vi e 4 defines a c distribution with jumping fibre dimensions in tope 1 and when the map vi e 5 arises from the curvature of the metric connection as in iii a 3 this distribution is integrable and the maximal leaves of the corresponding foliation of pe by complex analytic subvarieties are described by proposition vi e 3 the restrictions e w being flat the monodromy is discrete heuristic arguments suggest that the maximal leaves w pe are closed analytic subvarieties 92 conjecture vi e 6 finite monodromy provides the necessary and sufficient con dition to have the equality e n e of kodaira iitaka and numerical dimensions of a holomorphic vector bundle having a hermitian metric whose curvature satisfies the norm positivity condition the idea is that the quotient pe where is the equivalence relation given by the connected components of the foliation defined by vi e 1 exists as a complex analytic variety of dimension equal to n e and there is a meromorphic mapping pe 99 k pe together with an ample line bundle on pe that pulls back to ope 1 the rather simple guiding model here is the dual of the universal sub bundle over the grassman nian that was discussed above in fact the conjecture holds if e x is globally generated with metrics induced from the corresponding mapping to a grassmannian we note that the foliation defined by the null space of the holomorphic bi sectional curvature on quotients of bounded symmetric domains has been studied in mok 87 in this case the leaves are generally not closed finally we point out the very interesting papers cd 17 a and cd 17 b in these papers the authors construct examples of smooth fibrations f x b of a surface over a curve such that for e f x b one has e a q where a is an ample vector bundle and q is a flat u m c bundle with infinite monodromy group 59 in this case the leaves of the eds vi e 1 may be described as follows for each b b we have pq b pe b and using the flat connection on q the parallel translate of any point in pq b defines an integral curve of the eds references ak 00 d abramovich and k karu weak semistable reduction in characteristic 0 in vent math 139 no 2 2000 241 273 mr 1738451 zbl 0958
