foundational result in tropical geometry it states that the set of tropicalisations of points on a hypersurface coincides precisely with the tropical variety of the tropicalisation of the defining polynomial the aim of this paper is to generalise kapranov s theorem replacing the role of a valuation trop k r y t 8 u with a more general class of hyperfield homomorphisms h t which satisfy a relative algebraic closure condition the map tc t pxq logp x q where tc is the tropical complex hyperfield provides an example of such a hyperfield homomorphism 1 introduction hyperfields are generalisations of fields where the addition is allowed to be a multivalued operation the notion of a multivalued operation was introduced by marty in the mid 1930 s who discussed hypergroups then krasner in 13 progressed the notion to hyperrings and more recently the connection to tropical geometry has been discussed by viro in 15 then by connes and consani in 8 there has been substantial progress made in the last several years in the development of algebraic theory of hyperfields baker and bowler developed a theory for matroids over hyperfields in 2 and there has been work done by bowler and lorscheid on roots and multiplicities especially characterising multiplicities for the krasner sign and tropical hyperfields in 4 the work completed by jun in 12 and 11 is a more recent study of algebraic geometry over hyperfields the motivation for this paper comes from kapranov s theorem in tropical geometry 14 theorem 3 1 3 where it demonstrates a precise relationship between the variety of a poly nomial under a valuation map to r y t 8 u and the coordinate wise tropicalisation of the date june 2021 http arxiv org abs 2108 01524 v 1 2 james maxwell swansea university hypersurface of the defining polynomial we define a property of maps between hyperfields called relatively algebraically closed rac we outline this precisely in def 2 30 but intuitively the rac property states that when a univariate polynomial is pushed forward through a hyperfield homomorphism the roots of the polynomial can be lifted back to roots of the original polynomial the existence of a hyperfield homomorphism which has this property is demonstrated by the map logp q tc t in theorem 2 37 the main result of this paper is a hyperfield version of kapranov s theorem for rac hyperfield homomorphism which map to t theorem 1 1 take a rac hyperfield homomorphism f h t with induced polynomial map f hrx 1 xns trx 1 xns given by applying f coefficient wise then for all polynomials p p hrx 1 xns v pf ppqq fpv ppqq a natural question regarding the rac property of hyperfield homomorphisms is can we give tractable sufficient conditions to guarantee that a map between hyperfields is rac this question is explored in section 4 and partially answered stating sufficient conditions for a specific class of hyperfield homomorphisms to be rac structure of the paper in section 2 hyperfields and hyperfield homomorphisms will be introduced and the definitions of polynomials and their roots over hyperfields are recalled this will include examples of common hyperfields the relative algebraic closure property is defined in section 2 along with examples in particular it is shown that logp q tc t has this property then in section 3 the rac property is used to construct a proof of a hyperfield version of kapranov s theorem for maps h t 2 background a hyperfield is a generalisation of a field where the addition operation is allowed to be a multi valued operation introduced by marty and developed into hyperrings by krasner 13 hyperfields are one class of generalisations others include tracts see 3 and fuzzy rings see 9 there is a discussion of this range of algebraic structures in 5 the connection between fuzzy rings and hyperrings is described in 10 where a fully faithful functor from generalising kapranov s theorem for tropical geometry over hyperfields 3 hyperfields to fuzzy rings with weak morphisms is constructed one particular motivation for working with hyperfields is that the tropical semi ring where a foundational theory has been thoroughly developed in 14 has a generalisation to the tropical hyperfield this section will recall the definitions and notation of hyperfields 2 1 hyperfields given a set h then a map h h p phq will denote the hyper operation of h where p phq is the power set of h explicitly p phq is the set of all subsets of h given two elements x y p h then x y is a non empty subset of h then for subsets of h given a b h a b apa bpb pa bq this definition can be extended for a string of elements let x 1 xk p h then we define this as follows x 1 x 2 xk x 1 px 2 xk x 1 x 1 the hyper operation is called commutative and associative if it satisfies 2 1 x y y x and 2 2 px yq z x py zq respectively definition 2 3 a hypergroup is a tuple ph 0 q where is a commutative and associative hyper operation so 2 1 and 2 2 hold on h such that h 0 0 x txu x p h h 1 for every x p h there is a unique element of h denoted x such that 0 p x x h 2 x p y z iff z p x p yq this is normally referred to as reversibility definition 2 4 a hyperring is a tuple ph d 1 0 q such that ph d 1 q is a commutative monoid ph 0 q is a commutative hypergroup absorption rule 0 d x x d 0 0 for all x p h 4 james maxwell swansea university distributive law a d px yq pad xq pad yq for all a x y p h definition 2 5 a hyperring h is called a hyperfield if 0 1 and every non zero element of h has a multiplicative inverse remark 2 6 in all the hyper structures 0 and 1 simply represent the additive and multi plicative neutral element respectively the precise meaning of these neutral elements should be thought about in each specific example remark 2 7 from this point onward to clarify context when discussing results over a field k the following notation will be used por q and whereas when discussing results over a hyperfield h the following notation will be used d and 2 2 examples of hyperfields the following are some key examples of common hyper fields used in the literature they will be used to demonstrate the properties that are defined in this paper example 2 8 a field k can be viewed as a hyperfield in a trivial manner where the hyper addition is defined as x y tx yu example 2 9 the krasner hyperfield has the underlying set t 0 1 u and denoted k it is defined with standard multiplication and hyper addition is defined as 0 x x 0 txu for x 0 1 1 1 t 0 1 u example 2 10 the hyperfield of signs has the underlying set t 1 0 1 u and denoted by s the multiplication is the restriction of the usual multiplication on the real numbers and the hyper addition defined as 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 t 0 1 1 u generalising kapranov s theorem for tropical geometry over hyperfields 5 example 2 11 the tropical hyperfield has the underlying set ry t 8 u and is denoted as t the multiplication on t is an extension of the addition on r xd y x y the hyper addition is defined as the following multivalued operation 2 12 x y tmaxpx yqu if x y tz z xu y t 8 u if x y the tropical hyperfield is a natural generalisation of the tropical semi ring described in 14 the tropical hyperfield can also be defined using the minimum convention although throughout this paper t will be considered with the maximum convention as defined above example 2 13 the phase hyperfield denoted by p has the underlying set of s 1 y t 0 u which is the complex unit circle union with zero multiplication on p is inherited from c and the hyper addition is defined by the rule where s 1 tei p c 0 2 u 1 2 then ei 1 ei 2 t 0 ei 1 ei 2 u 1 2 1 then ei 1 ei 2 tei 1 2 u 2 1 2 then ei 1 ei 2 tei 2 1 u see 2 and 7 for alternative but equivalent definitions of the phase hyperfield the final example is a key part of the results outlined in the following sections the main purpose it has is as a candidate to replace the valued field in kapranov s theorem example 2 14 the tropical complex hyperfield is denoted tc and has the complex numbers c as its underlying set the standard complex multiplication is given to tc the hyper addition is defined in the following way for all z w p c z w tc p c c zu if w z z if z w w if w z shortest arc connecting z and w with radius z if z w z w with this hyper addition tc is a hyperfield 6 james maxwell swansea university 2 3 hyperfield homomorphisms the maps between hyperfields are called hyperfield homomorphisms and are defined in the following way definition 2 15 given hypergroups h 1 and h 2 with respective hyper operations 1 and 2 a hypergroup homomorphism is a map f h 1 h 2 such that fp 0 q 0 and fpx 1 yq fpxq 2 fpyq for all x y p h 1 definition 2 16 given hyperrings h 1 and h 2 with respective hyper operations 1 and 2 and multiplication d 1 and d 2 a homomorphism of hyperrings f h 1 h 2 is defined by 1 fpx 1 yq fpxq 2 fpyq and fp 0 q 0 2 fpxd 1 yq fpxq d 2 fpyq and fp 1 q 1 essentially this is a homomorphism of additive hypergroups and a homomorphism of mul tiplicative monoids definition 2 17 a hyperfield homomorphism is defined as a homomorphism of underlying hyperrings example 2 18 the following are common examples of hyperfield homomorphisms between the hyperfields outlined in the previous subsection h k x 1 x 0 0 0 ph c p phpxq x x x 0 php 0 q 0 sgn r s sgnpxq 1 if x p r 0 1 if x p r 0 0 if x 0 the next example will be a description of the hyperfield homomorphism which is the basis for the results in this paper example 2 19 there exists a hyperfield homomorphism between the tropical complex hyperfield and the tropical hyperfield the map is denoted tc t and is defined as pzq logp z q there are more details of how this map is constructed outlined in 1 where the map is discussed in two parts generalising kapranov s theorem for tropical geometry over hyperfields 7 2 4 polynomials over hyperfields this section will outline how polynomials and their roots are defined over hyperfields note the difference from the classical case of defining polynomials over fields definition 2 20 the set of polynomials in n variables over a hyperfield h will be denoted hrx 1 xns where elements of this set are defined as 2 21 ppx 1 xnq i cix i 1 x in i cix i where the multi index notation is used and i pi 1 inq zn and ci p h remark 2 22 note that the notation hrx 1 xns is used only to denote the set of poly nomials over h and there is no algebraic structure considered on this set it can be illustrated in the univariate case that this object is not a hyperring as the multivalued nature of the addition in h combined with the distributivity leads to products of polynomials also being multivalued for example pax bqpcx dq acx 2 pad bcqx bd the coefficient pad bcq is not necessarily single valued which shows that multiplication of polynomials is multivalued hence hrx 1 xns is not a hyperring definition 2 23 let ppx 1 xnq i cix i be a polynomial defined over a hyperfield h then an element a pa 1 anq is a root of the polynomial if 0 p ppaq i ciai this allows for a natural definition of the variety of ppx 1 xnq as v ppq ta pa 1 anq p hn 0 p ppaqu the next definition recalls the notion of the multiplicity of a root for univariate polynomials defined over hyperfields definition 2 24 4 def 1 5 let ppxq p hrxs the multiplicity of an element a p h is denoted multappq and defined as 2 25 multappq 0 if a is not a root 1 maxtmultapqq p p px aqqpxqu because of the multivalued nature of multiplication of polynomials with coefficients in a hyperfield the polynomial qpxq in 2 25 is not necessarily unique this is the motivation 8 james maxwell swansea university behind the recursive maximum definition of the multiplicity see 4 for details on the original definition and examples of the non uniqueness example 2 26 1 if ppxq x 2 x 1 p krxs then 1 p v ppq as pp 1 q 1 1 1 k q 0 2 if ppxq x 2 x 1 p srxs then 1 p v ppq as pp 1 q 1 1 1 s q 0 remark 2 27 there is a complete description of roots and corresponding multiplicities for univariate polynomials over k s and t in 4 where the results are used to demonstrate proofs of descartes rule of signs and newton s polygon rule now that polynomials have been defined their structure can be combined with hyperfield homomorphisms to describe an induced map of polynomials over hyperfields definition 2 28 let f h 1 h 2 be a hyperfield homomorphism this induces a map from polynomials with coefficients in h 1 to polynomials with coefficients in h 2 this map is denoted f h 1 rx 1 xns h 2 rx 1 xns and is defined for ppx 1 xnq i cix i p h 1 rx 1 xns as f ppq i fpciqxi p h 2 rx 1 xns note the hyper operations are now the operations over h 2 and f ppq will be called the push forward of p example 2 29 take the polynomial ppxq 4 x 2 5 x 1 p rrxs the hyperfield homo morphism sgn r s induces the map sgn rrxs srxs which gives sgn ppqpxq x 2 x 1 p srxs next the definition of a relatively algebraically closed hyperfield homomorphism is introduced this property identifies whether a root of polynomial can be pulled back through hyperfield homomorphism this notion is described precisely for univariate polynomials below definition 2 30 let f h 1 h 2 be a hyperfield homomorphism with induced map f h 1 rxs h 2 rxs we say that f is relatively algebraically closed rac if for any generalising kapranov s theorem for tropical geometry over hyperfields 9 univariate polynomial f ppq p h 2 rxs each root of f ppq can be lifted back through the map f to a root of the original polynomial p the following example outlines a rac map which is the main motivating example for this paper it is the map that is studied in tropical geometry and is the basis for the generalisation to hyperfield homomorpshisms example 2 31 let k be an algebraically closed field with surjective valuation trop k r y t 8 u then this is rac hyperfield homomorphism example 2 32 take the quotient map sgn r s and the polynomial ppxq x 2 x 1 p rrxs then sgn ppq x 2 x 1 p srxs the polynomial ppxq has an empty variety whereas sgn ppqp 1 q 1 1 1 s so 1 p v psgn ppqq this demonstrates that the map r s is not a rac map example 2 33 take the map ph c p and the polynomial ppxq x 2 x 1 p crxs it is shown in 4 remark 1 10 that ph ppqpxq has a root at each a ei for all 2 3 2 not every element of this set can be lifted and hence ph c p is not a rac map the remainder of the section will be focussed on demonstrating that the map tc t satisfies the rac property there are certain conditions which classify when polynomials admit roots over different hyperfields the next result is an outline of how roots are achieved over the tropical complex hyperfield proposition 2 34 let ppxq ni 0 cix i p tcrxs an element a p tc is a root of ppxq if 0 p ppaq this precisely occurs when either d j p t 1 nu s t cjaj ciai i j and cjaj c 0 d j 1 jm p t 1 nu s t cj 1 aj 1 cjmajm ciai i r tj 1 jmu and c 0 p mk 1 cjkajk proof for a p tc to be a root of a polynomial ppxq a zero must belong to the output set or 0 p ppaq 0 p n i 0 cia i 0 p c 0 c 1 a cnan 10 james maxwell swansea university c 0 p c 1 a cnan this is determined by the set c 1 a cna n if this hyper sum is a singleton then the first case holds if the hyper sum is a set then this is either an arc or a disc in the complex plane but in either case there is a subset of the monomials which directly determines whether it is an arc or a disc these are the precise monomials described in the second case of the statement thus c 0 must belong to this set determined by the dominating monomials proposition 2 35 given ppxq p trxs an element a p t is a root of p if the maximum of ppaq is achieved more than once this is a direct generalisation of the characterisation of roots over the tropical semi ring and can ben viewed in an analogous way focusing on the hyperfield homomorphism tc t it can be seen that using the following lemma is a rac map lemma 2 36 given a b p t if a b then for all p 1 paq and p 1 pbq it holds that proof taking a b p t such that a b if p 1 paq and p 1 pbq then logp q a b logp q as both the logarithm and exponential functions preserve order logp q logp q as required theorem 2 37 the hyperfield homomorphism tc t is rac proof a polynomial p ni 0 cix i p tcrxs has push forward ppq n i 0 pciqx i p trxs under the induced polynomial map tcrxs trxs for convenience denote ppq q p trxs take an element a p v pqq and observe how a p t gives rise to 8 in the output set 8 p qpaq 8 p n i 0 pciqai 8 p pc 0 q pc 1 qa pcnqan pc 0 q p pc 1 qa pcnqan the output set produced by pc 1 qa pcnqan can take one of two forms first it could be a single element or it is a set of elements given that a p v pqq this can be written as 2 38 pc 1 qa pcnqan pc 0 q generalising kapranov s theorem for tropical geometry over hyperfields 11 or 2 39 pc 1 qa pcnqan r 8 rs q pc 0 q these two cases will be dealt with separately firstly take the situation in 2 38 the equality holds if there exists a j p t 1 nu such that pcjqaj pciqai for all i j and pcjqaj pc 0 q this implies that 2 40 a pc 0 q pcjqq 1 j a lift for a is denoted as ra p 1 paq which here is specifically given as ra c 0 cj 1 j it remains to show that ra p v ppq by lemma 2 36 2 41 cjraj cirai for all i j therefore ppraq n i 0 cirai c 0 c 1 ra cnra c 0 cjraj c 0 cj c 0 cj 1 j j c 0 c 0 q 0 hence ra p v ppq and ra p 1 paq as required secondly take the situation in 2 39 for pc 1 qa pcnqan r 8 rs q pc 0 q there must exist k 1 km p t 1 nu such that pck 1 qak 1 pckmqakm pciqai for all i p t 0 nuztk 1 kmu explicitly the maximum is achieved more than once in the terms pc 1 qa 1 pcnqan and this maximum is greater than pc 0 q a lift of a is denoted as ra p 1 paq and is here specifically defined as ra ct 1 ct 1 t t 1 12 james maxwell swansea university where t t 1 p tk 1 kmu in a corresponding manner to the first part it requires to be shown that ra p 1 paq and ra p v ppq observe that pctqat pct 1 qat 1 which can be manipulated to give a pct 1 q pctq 1 t t 1 with some applications of the hyperfield homomorphism properties it can be shown that ra is a lift of a what remains is to demonstrate that ra is a root of the original polynomial p note that due to lemma 2 36 ck 1 rak 1 ckmrakm cirai for all i r tk 1 kmu furthermore observe the relationship between the monomial terms with t t 1 exponents ctrat ct 1 rat 1 ct ct 1 ct 1 t t 1 t ct 1 ct 1 ct 1 t t 1 t 1 p 1 q t t t 1 pctq t 1 t t 1 pct 1 q t t t 1 p 1 q t 1 t t 1 pctq t 1 t t 1 pct 1 q t t t

corollary 2 42 the tropical complex hyperfield tc is algebraically closed proof as a consequence of the results on roots and multiplicities in 4 t is algebraically closed as the map tc t is rac and surjective every polynomial ppxq p tcrxs has a corresponding polynomial ppqpxq p trxs which has a root and can be lifted back to a root of ppxq hence every polynomial in tcrxs has a root generalising kapranov s theorem for tropical geometry over hyperfields 13 example 2 43 take the polynomial ppxq ix 2 1 i 3 2 x 1 p tcrxs then the push froward is ppqpxq 0 d x 2 0 d x 0 p trxs it can be seen that 0 p v p ppqq in accordance to the proof of theorem 2 37 take t 2 and t 1 1 this gives ct c 2 i ct 1 c 1 1 i 3 2 1 pt t 1 q 1 taking the template for the lift ra ct 1 ct 1 t t 1 1 i 3 2 i now to confirm that this is a pull back of 0 and is a root of ppxq 1 i 3 2 i 1 2 1 i 3 1 f 1 i 3 2 i 0 finally ppraq p 1 i 3 2 i i 1 i 3 2 i 2 1 i 3 2 1 i 3 2 i 1 i 3 2 1 i 3 2 i 1 i 3 2 i 3 2 1 tz p c z 1 u 1 q 0 this shows that ra is a lifted root which demonstrates the application of the structure of the proof of theorem 2 37 3 generalised kapranov s theorem this section will outline a specific generalisation of kapranov s theorem over hyperfields the original theorem by kapranov see theorem 3 1 3 in 14 is a key result in tropical geometry which leads to the fundamental theorem of tropical geometry in 14 a summary version of the original theorem in tropical geometry is stated here theorem 3 1 given an algebraically closed field k with surjective valuation trop k r y t 8 u then for a laurent polynomial ppxq ipzn cix i p krx 1 1 x 1 n s v ptropppqq troppv ppqq for a detailed full result see 14 theorem 3 1 3 14 james maxwell swansea university an essential point to recognise is that one half of a generalised version of kapranov s theorem holds over all hyperfield homomorphisms lemma 3 2 let h 1 and h 2 be hyperfields with a hyperfield homomorphism f h 1 h 2 and induced map f h 1 rx 1 xns h 2 rx 1 xns for ppx 1 xnq i cix i p h 1 rx 1 xns then fpv ppqq v pf ppqq proof by definition f ppqpx 1 xnq i fpciqx i p h 2 rx 1 xns let a pa 1 anq p h n 1 be a root of ppx 1 xnq meaning a p v ppq and 3 3 0 p ppaq ppa 1 anq i cia i the aim is to demonstrate that fpaq p v pf ppqq holds firstly f ppqpfpaqq i fpciqfpaqi i fpciaiq f i cia i q fp 0 q 0 the above steps use the properties of a hyperfield homomorphism to give that 0 p fppqpfpaqq yielding fpaq p v pf ppqq hence proving that fpv ppqq v pf ppqq the main result of the paper is to specifically generalise kapranov s theorem to hyperfield homomorphisms f h t which satisfy the rac property the result that tc t is a rac map can be used to develop an analogous statement for polynomials in n variables over tc this will come as a consequence of the following theorem which demonstrates that the rac property for a hyperfield homomorphism h t can be used to deduce the existence of a pull back of roots for polynomials in n variables theorem 3 4 generalised kapranov s theorem given a polynomial p p hrx 1 xns then for a rac hyperfield homomorphism f h t v pf ppqq fpv ppqq generalising kapranov s theorem for tropical geometry over hyperfields 15 proof the proof will comprise of two parts each of which will show the inclusion of sets in one direction thus combing both directions will imply equality the first inclusion fpv ppqq v pf ppqq is a direct consequence of lemma 3 2 the inclusion in the reverse direction v pf ppqq fpv ppqq is more interesting and requires a more involved explanation take a point a p v pf ppqq so 8 p f ppqpaq the aim is to demonstrate that there is exists an element in v ppq that pushes forward to a this will be done by restricting to univariate polynomials and using the property that f h t is a rac map to find an appropriate lift of a the following diagram will be used to illustrate how the ppx 1 xnq will be restricted to a univariate polynomial consider the following hyperfield homomorphisms f hn tn f px 1 xnq pfpx 1 q fpxnqq h hn pxq p 1 d xd 1 n d xdnqq where i p h t tn pxq pfp 1 q d xd 1 fp nq d xdnq pfp 1 q d 1 x fp nq dnxq below is a diagram of how these hyperfield homomorphisms commutatively interact h t h n t n f f there are some key conditions that need to be imposed on and through restrictions on 1 n and d 1 dn choose each i such that i p f 1 paiq where a pa 1 anq p v pf ppqq secondly choose the set d pd 1 dnq such that the dot products of d taken with exponent vectors of monomial terms of p are all distinct explicitly d k d 1 k 1 dn kn d 1 j 1 dn jn d j 16 james maxwell swansea university where k and j are the exponent vectors for distinct monomial terms of p it can now be noted that p 0 q fp q a next there will be a restriction of p through to a univariate polynomial over h this restriction is denoted p and is defined as p pp pxqq pp 1 d xd 1 n d xdnq i ci d p 1 d xd 1 qi 1 d d p n d xdnqin i ci d i d xd i p hrxs this restriction draws on the requirement imposed on the set d pd 1 dnq if the requirement was not imposed this would allow multiple monomials in the restricted poly nomial to have equal exponents this would lead to the corresponding coefficient being a hyper sum thus the potentially detrimental possibility of the restriction becoming a set of polynomials rather than a single polynomial which is what is needed here the pull back polynomial p is now pushed forward to f p pq p trxs the image of f p pq is equal to the image of f ppq when restricted to f ppqp pxqq f ppq fp 1 q d xd 1 fp nq d xdn i fpciq d fp qi d xd i f p pqpxq the next step is to show that f p pq has a root at 0 p t this can be seen as f p pqp 0 q i fpciq d fp qi d 0 d i then due to the arithmetic over t i fpciq d fp qi d 0 d i i fpciq d fp qi which can be realised as i fpciq d fp qi i fpciq d ai f ppqpaq q 8 this shows that 0 p v pf p pqq then the property that the map f h t is a rac homomorphism gives that there exists an element ra p h such that fpraq 0 and ra p v p pq generalising kapranov s theorem for tropical geometry over hyperfields 17 this element ra can then be pushed forward through to give an element praq p v ppq as the diagram commutes this shows that the f p praqq pfpraqq p 0 q a which is suffi cient to show that for every element of v pf ppqq there is a lift to an element of v ppq this demonstrates that v pf ppqq fpv ppqq giving the desired result hence it has been shown that both fpv ppqq v pf ppqq and v pf ppqq fpv ppqq hold these taken together demonstrate the required equality v pf ppqq fpv ppqq the structure of the proof restricting to univariate polynomials to use the rac property is based on the argument outlined in a proof of the original theorem in tropical geometry as seen in 6 in particular since tc t is rac the above theorem applies to it 4 characterising rac maps this section aims to outline sufficient conditions for a hyperfield homomorphism to be a rac map this will not include a complete description of the necessary conditions for a hyperfield homomorphism to be a rac this remains an open topic but instead demonstrates sufficient conditions for specific homomorphisms to be rac to begin the exploration into rac hyperfield homomorphisms a definition linking multiplicities of roots to the degree of the polynomial definition 4 1 a hyperfield is said to satisfy the multiplicity bound if for all univariate polynomials ppxq p hrxs the following bound holds aph multappq degppq one result from 4 is proposition b it outlines a relationship between the multiplicity of roots over a field and the multiplicity of the push forward of these roots over a hyperfield it is stated below in notation consistent with this paper 18 james maxwell swansea university proposition 4 2 4 prop b let k be a field and h and hyperfield with hyperfield homomorphism f k h let ppxq p krxs with push forward f ppqpxq p hrxs then multbpf ppqq apf 1 pbq multappq for all b p h moreover if h satisfies the multiplicity bound for the polynomial f ppq and p p krxs splits into linear factors then multbpf ppqq apf 1 pbq multappq lemma 4 3 let f k h be a hyperfield homomorphism with h satisfying the multi plicity bound if the polynomial p p krxs splits into linear factors then v pf ppqq fpv ppqq for p proof take the polynomial p p krxs f ppq p hrxs take b p v pf ppqq giving 0 p f ppqpbq multbpf ppqq 0 as p splits into linear factors over k and h satisfies the multiplicity bound by proposition 4 2 we have 0 multbpf ppqq apf 1 pbq multappq therefore there exists a p f 1 pbq such that multa ppq 0 thus a is a root of p p krxs this demonstrates that given an element b p v pf ppqq there exists an element a such that fpa q b and ppa q 0 this shows that v pf ppqq fpv ppqq lemma 4 4 the rac property of a hyperfield homomorphism f h 1 h 2 is equivalent to v pf ppqq fpv ppqq for all univariate polynomials ppxq p h 1 rxs proof given f h 1 h 2 which is rac this implies that given polynomial p p h 1 rxs with f ppq p h 2 then if is a root of f ppq then there is a p h 1 that is a root of p and fp q this can be rephrased in terms of varieties the rac properties states that for p v pf ppqq there is an element p v ppq such that fp q hence for every element of v pf ppqq there is a corresponding element of v ppq with the map fp q this is precisely stating that for every element of v pf ppqq there is a corresponding element of fpv ppqq implying v pf ppqq fpv ppqq generalising kapranov s theorem for tropical geometry over hyperfields 19 conversely given that v pf ppqq fpv ppqq the aim is to show that this implies that the map f h 1 h 2 is rac the property v pf ppqq fpv ppqq gives that for every element of the variety of f ppq there is a corresponding element of v ppq which pushes forward to it explicitly an element of fpv ppqq this is precisely the rac property given an element of the variety of the push forward of a polynomial there is a pull back to an element of the variety of the original polynomial the two above lemmas provide one method of detecting whether a hyperfield homomorphism from a field to a hyperfield is a rac map the next stage is to understand whether this view can be extended to maps f h 1 h 2 the foundation of the logic in the previous discussion is the results of prop b from 4 the following discussion has the aim to explore a generalisation of this result in proposition 4 2 where the hyperfield homomorphism is defined as f h 1 h 2 firstly it is important to recognise that this is not a simple generalisation and the property from prop b in 4 does not always hold in this less restrictive setting example 4 5 take the hyperfield homomorphism f p k note that over the krasner hyperfield k the multiplicity bound achieves equality for all polynomials bpkmultbppq degppq for all p p krxs see remark 1 11 in 4 for details define a polynomial ppxq x 2 x 1 p prxs then due to the work outlined in 4 in remark 1 10 appmultappq 8 now the push forward coefficients of the polynomial are unchanged f ppqpxq x 2 x 1 with bpkmultbpfppqq 2 this then leads to 8 appzt 0 u multappq apf 1 p 1 q multappq mult 1 pfppqq 2 this demonstrates that the property does not hold in total generality over all hyperfield homomorphisms there are conditions where the property does hold the crucial point of the proof of the original statement in 4 is that all fields satisfy the multiplicity bound explicitly the sum of all the multiplicities of roots over a field are bounded by the degree on the polynomial this is not the case in hyperfields in general as shown in example 4 5 20 james maxwell swansea university lemma 4 6 given the hyperfield homomorphism f h 1 h 2 then for all ppxq n i 0 cix i p h 1 rxs 4 7 multbpfppqq apf 1 pbq multappq holds if h 1 satisfies the multiplicity bound proof the proof is constructed in the same way as the proof to proposition b in 4 but will be outlined here to demonstrate the necessary adjustments specifically the multiplicity bound on h 1 let a 1 an p h be such that ppajq q 0 in hrxs these elements may not need to be a distinct list if not distinct then the number of times that aj appears in the list ta 1 anu is equal to the multiplicity of aj as a root of p due to the fact thath 1 satisfies the multiplicity bound this finite list is the complete list of roots including their multiplicities and this list is at most of length n degppq define g 1 p and for i 1 n set gi 1 p hrxs as gi p px aiqgi 1 p hrxs more explicitly p g 1 p px a 1 qg 2 g 2 p px a 2 qg 3 p p px a 1 qpx a 2 qg 3 which continues up until gn assume that fpa 1 q fpanq b and that there is no other element a p h such that fpaq b and gnpaq q 0 this implies that a 1 an are all the roots of p counted with multiplicities having fpaiq b now to observe the push forward of these factor polynomials gi the relationship gi p px aiqgi 1 mapped under the hyperfield homomorphism f h 1 h 2 gives fpgiq p f px aiqgi 1 fpx aiq fpgi 1 q px bq fpgi 1 q generalising kapranov s theorem for tropical geometry over hyperfields 21 yielding gi p px aiqgi 1 fpgiq p px bq fpgi 1 q therefore the chain of g 1 gn gives fppq fpg 1 q p px bqpx bq px bqfpgn 1 q showing that multbpfppqq n which is the sum of the multiplicities of the set ta 1 anu the roots of p which push forward to b multbpfppqq apf 1 pbq multappq this generalisation of prop b from 4 allows for a discussion using lemma 4 3 towards when a general hyperfield homomorphism f h 1 h 2 is a rac map theorem 4 8 for the surjective homomorphism f h 1 h 2 if aph 1 multappq degppq for all polynomials over h 1 rxs and h 2 satisfies the multiplicity bound then the map f is a rac map proof the hyperfield h 1 having aph 1 multappq degppq implies that by lemma 4 6 multbpf ppqq apf 1 pbq multappq holds these together then imply that multbpf ppqq apf 1 pbq multappq by the following logic degppq aph 1 multappq bph 2 multbpfppqq degpf ppqq degppq then finally multbpf ppqq apf 1 pbq multappq gives that the map f h 1 h 2 is rac using analogous logic to the proof of lemma 4 3 remark 4 9 theorem 4 8 demonstrates that there are sufficient conditions that can be given to both hyperfields to give the corresponding homomorphism as rac although this does not classify all rac maps it does incorporate the motivating example for the the paper trop k r y t 8 u although it can be seen that tc does not satisfy the multiplicity bound and hence does not fulfil the conditions of theorem 4 8 this demonstrates the theoretical complexity in attempting to outline the conditions for a hyperfield homomorphism to be rac 22 james maxwell swansea university references 1 laura anderson and james f davis hyperfield grassmannians advances in
