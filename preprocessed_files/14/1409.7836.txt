proving theorem 1 3 when aut 0 m l 1 8 4 proving theorem 1 3 in general cases 12 1 introduction in this paper we prove that any polarized k stable manifold is cm stable this has been known to me for quite a while in fact the case for fano manifolds already appeared in ti 12 and our arguments for the proof here will follow the approach there letm be a projective manifold polarized by an ample line bundle l by the kodaira embedding theorem for sufficiently large a basis of h 0 m l gives an embedding m 7 cpn where n dimch 0 m l 1 any other basis gives an embedding of the form where g sl n 1 c we fix such an embedding let us recall the cm stability which originated in ti 97 it can be defined in terms of mabuchi s k energy m 0 1 v 1 0 m ric t t n 1 t dt 1 1 where 0 is a ka her metric with ka hler class 2 c 1 l and 0 1 and c 1 m c 1 l n 1 c 1 l n 1 2 supported partially by grants from nsf and nsfc 1 http arxiv org abs 1409 7836 v 1 given an embedding m cpn by k m we have an induced function on g sl n 1 c which acts on cpn f m 0 1 3 where is defined by 1 fs 0 1 1 4 note that f is well defined since is unique modulo addition of constants similarly we can define j on g by j j 0 1 5 where j 0 n 1 i 0 i 1 n 1 m 1 i 0 n i 1 1 6 definition 1 1 we call m cm semistable with respect to l if f is bounded from below and cm stable with respect to l if f bounded from below and is proper modulo j i e for any sequence i g f i whenever inf aut 0 m l j i 1 7 where aut 0 m l denotes the identity component of the automorphism group of m l if aut 0 m l is trivial then 1 8 simply means that f i whenever j i we say m l cm stable resp cm semistable if m is cm stable resp cm semistable with respect to l for all sufficiently large remark 1 2 in ti 97 the cm stability is defined in terms of the orbit of a lifting of m in certain determinant line bundle referred as the cm polarization theorem 8 9 in ti 97 states that such an algebraic formulation is equivalent to the one in definition 1 1 the cm stability of m l is directly related to the existence of ka hler metrics with constant scalar curvature and ka hler class c 1 l when m is a fano manifold polarized by the anti canonical bundle k 1 m it follows from ti 09 and the partial c 0 estimate that m admits a ka hler einstein metric whenever it is cm stable see ti 12 in general we had proposed a similar program towards the ytd conjecture if m l is k stable then there is a ka hler metric with constant scalar curvature and ka hler class 2 c 1 l we say m 0 is proper on the space p m 0 c 0 if there is a function f bounded from below such that limt f t and m 0 inf aut 0 m l f j 0 p m 0 1 8 2 where is given by 0 1 it was conjectured see tian 98 1 that m admits a ka hler metric of constant scalar curvature and ka hler class 2 c 1 l if m 0 is proper on p m 0 we also conjecture that a version of partial c 0 estimate holds for ka hler metrics with ka hler class 2 c 1 l if these conjectures can be verified we can solve the ytd conjecture our main result of this paper is the following theorem 1 3 let m l be a polarized projective manifold which is k stable then m is cm stable with respect to any l which is very ample in particular m l is cm stable we refer the readers to ti 97 do 02 and subsection 4 1 of ti 09 for the definition of the k stability if m is a k stable fano manifold one can deduce from theorem 1 3 the existence of a ka hler einstein metric on m this is ex actly the second approach in ti 97 to complete the proof of the ytd conjecture for fano manifolds using the asymptotics of the k energy in lemma 2 1 one can easily show the converse the cm stability implies the k stability the rest of this paper is devoted to the proof of theorem 1 3 acknowledgement i would like to thank chi li and sean paul for useful comments on improving presentation of this paper 2 asymptotics of the k energy in this section we recall a result which relates the futaki invariant to the asymptotic expansion of the k energy let g 0 be an algebraic subgroup g 0 t t c g then there is a unique limiting cycle m 0 lim t 0 t m cpn 2 1 ifg 0 acts onm 0 non trivially one can associate the generalized futaki invariant fm 0 l 0 g 0 for m 0 where l 0 o 1 m 0 this invariant was defined by ding tian for normal or irreducible m 0 dt 92 and by donaldson for general m 0 it can be also formulated as the cm weight introduced in ti 97 if g 0 acts on m 0 trivially we simply set fm 0 l 0 g 0 0 in his thesis li 12 also see pt 06 c li observed lemma 2 1 for any algebraic subgroup g 0 t t c of g we have f t fm 0 l 0 g 0 a g 0 log t 2 o 1 as t 0 2 2 where a g 0 q is non negative and the equality holds ifm 0 has no non reduced components 1 in ti 98 we define the properness in the case that aut 0 m l is trivial also one can easily show that the property of properness is independent of the choice of 0 3 proof c li has pointed out that 2 2 can be actually derived from ti 97 for the readers convenience we give a proof here by using arguments from ti 97 define x as the set of all x t in cpn c satisfying x t m when t 6 0 and x m 0 when t 0 it admits a compactification x as follows there is an natural biholomorphism from x 0 x m 0 onto m c by x t 1 t x t consider cp 1 as c plus the point then we define x x x 0 m c m cp 1 0 clearly x admits a fibration over cp 1 also l induces a relatively ample bundle l over x l x 1 ocpn 1 x and l m cp 1 0 1 l where i denotes the projection onto the ith factor since s s for any s c we have a g 0 action on x s x t is equal to s x s t on x and x s t on m cp 1 0 similarly there is an natural lifting of g 0 action on l which acts on l x as given and on l m cp 1 0 1 l by s v t v s t where v l let p x 7 x be a g 0 equivariant resolution and l p l cf ko 07 there is an induced fibration x 7 cp 1 we denote mz 1 z choose a smooth hermitian norm h on l over x satisfying 1 h p 1 h 1 over 1 z c z 1 where h 1 denotes a fixed hermitian metric on ocpn 1 whose curvature is the fubini study metric fs 2 for any z c the curvature form r h of h restricts to a ka hler metric z on mz satisfying z z fs mz for z 1 and z 0 for z 2 here we regard x p 1 m 0 x m 0 asm cp 1 0 we may further assume that for z 2 h mz is equal to a fixed norm h 0 on l and for z 1 z h mz e z h 0 where z is a corresponding ka hler potential i e 1 z 0 1 z let k kx k 1 cp 1 be the relative canonical bundle of x 7 cp 1 it has an induced hermitian norm k on k 1 over cp 1 0 for each z cp 1 0 k mz is given by the determinant of z clearly the curvature form r k of k restricts to ric z on each mz put f z m 0 z then f is a continuous function on cp 1 0 constant for z 2 and coincides with f for z 1 following those direct computations exactly as we did for 8 5 in ti 97 we can show that for any smooth function z with support contained in cp 1 0 cp 1 f 1 v x r k n n 1 r h 1 r h n 2 3 where v c 1 l n 4 let be a ka hler metric on x we can construct another hermitian metric k on k as we did for k then the ratio k k is an non negative function bounded from above it follows from 2 3 cp 1 f 1 v x r k n n 1 r h 1 r h n 2 4 where z 1 v mz k k log k k n 2 5 this is a bounded function in fact it is continuous in z denote by gx and gb the hermitian norms on k 1 x and k 1 cp 1 induced by the metric on x and the fubini study metric fs on cp 1 define z 1 v mz log k gb gx 1 r h n 2 6 it is easy to show cf ti 97 2 that is bounded from above and extends across 0 continuously if m 0 does not have components of multiplicity greater than 1 in fact one can show see pt 04 and pa 08 that t a g 0 log t 2 o 1 as t 0 2 7 where a g 0 0 and o 1 denotes a bounded quantity it follows from 2 4 cp 1 f 1 v x r gb r gx n n 1 r h 1 r h n let l be the determinant line bundle det e where e is defined by 2 n 1 n v e k 1 k l l 1 n n n 1 l l 1 n 1 this line bundle l was introduced in ti 97 and called the cm line bundle or polarization 3 by the grothendick riemann roch theorem the first chern class of l is given by c 1 l n c 1 k c 1 l n n n 1 c 1 l n 1 the corresponding degree is simply the cm weight dated back to ti 97 it was proved in lx 11 that this cm weight coincides with the generalized futaki invariant fm 0 l 0 g 0 furthermore there is a ho lder continuous norm b on l over cp 1 whose curvature form is given by the push forward form r gb r gx n n 1 r h 1 r h n 2 this function is denoted as z there 3 a different formulation of the cm line bundle was given in pt 06 which suits better for more general fibrations 5 fix a unit z 0 c and 1 l z 0 then we set s z t 1 l z where z t z 0 this defines a holomorphic section s of l over c which extends to cp 1 0 moreover it is non zero at it follows from the above discussions f log s 2 b 0 on c since f log s b is bounded near we conclude f log s 2 b c 2 8 where c is a constant on the other hand we can extend s to be a meromorphic section of l with an zero or pole of order fm 0 l 0 g 0 at 0 then 2 2 follows from 2 8 2 7 and the facts that is bounded and f t f t for t 1 we can use the arguments in the proof to identify fm 0 l 0 g 0 a g 0 with a generalized futaki invariant of some special degeneration of m let us first describe such a degeneration we will adopt the notations in last proof note that there is an natural fibration x 7 c it was shown in lx 11 also see alv 09 that there is a g 0 equivariant semi stable reduction x 7 c of x whose generic fiber is biholomorphic to m 4 this implies that the central fiber m 0 1 0 is a singular variety with normal crossings furthermore there is an natural map q x 7 x of degree m with q m 0 m 0 then we have a generalized futaki invariant fm 0 l 0 g 0 associated to the degeneration x 7 c lemma 2 2 for any g 0 above we have f t 1 m fm 0 l 0 g 0 log t 2 o 1 as t 0 2 9 in particular we have fm 0 l 0 g 0 m fm 0 l 0 g 0 a g 0 2 10 proof we will use the arguments in the proof of last lemma to prove 2 9 let x be the compactification of x and l be the line bundle over x con structed in the proof of lemma 2 1 then it admits ag 0 equivariant semi stable reduction x s 7 cp 1 such that it is a compactification of x with smooth fiber over cp 1 and admits a holomorphic map q x s 7 x of degree m to prove 2 9 which is equivalent to 2 10 we simply argue as we did in the proof of lemma 2 1 with p x 7 x replaced by q x s 7 x 4 in fact we do not need x to be a semi stable reduction in the subsequent discussions it is sufficient if the central fiber of x is free of multiple components then such a x can be taken to be the normalization of a base change of x 6 the norm h in the proof of last lemma induces a hermitian norm still denoted by h on l q l over x s as before by identifying x s m 0 with m cp 1 0 the curvature r h restricts to a ka hler metric z on m z which is simply 1 z for any z c satisfying z z fs m z for z 1 and z 0 for z 2 further we have h m z h 0 on l for z 2 and z h m z e z h 0 for z 1 letk kx s k 1 cp 1 be the relative canonical bundle of x s 7 cp 1 it has an induced hermitian norm k on k 1 over cp 1 0 for each z cp 1 0 k m z is given by the determinant of z clearly the curvature form r k of k restricts to ric z on each m z it follows from 2 3 m cp 1 f 1 v x s r k n n 1 r h 1 r h n 2 11 let be a ka hler metric on x s we can construct another hermitian metric k on k as we did for k then the ratio k k is an non negative function bounded from above it follows from 2 3 cp 1 mf 1 v x s r k n n 1 r h 1 r h n 2 12 where z 1 v m z k k log k k n 2 13 this is again a bounded function denote by g and gb the hermitian norms on k 1 x s and k 1 cp 1 induced by the metric on x s and the fubini study metric fs on cp 1 define z 1 v m z log k gb g 1 r h n 2 14 since m 0 has no multiple components is bounded it follows from 2 12 cp 1 mf 1 v x s r gb r gx s n n 1 r h 1 r h n let l be the determinant line bundle det e where e is defined by 2 n 1 n v e k 1 k l l 1 n n n 1 l l 1 n 1 by the grothendick riemann roch theorem the first chern class of l is given by c 1 l n c 1 k c 1 l n n n 1 c 1 l n 1 7 the corresponding degree is the cm weight which is equal to the invariant fm 0 l 0 g 0 furthermore there is a ho lder continuous norm b on l over cp 1 whose curvature form is given by the push forward form r gb r gx s n n 1 r h 1 r h n fix a unit z 0 c and 1 l z 0 then we set s z t 1 l z where z t z 0 this defines a holomorphic section s of l over c which extends to cp 1 0 moreover it is non zero at it follows from the above discussions mf log s 2 b 0 on c since mf log s b is bounded near we conclude mf log s 2 b c 2 15 where c is a constant on the other hand we can extend s to be a meromorphic section of l with an zero or pole of order fm 0 l 0 g 0 at 0 then 2 9 follows from 2 15 and the facts that both and are bounded remark 2 3 one can also prove 2 9 by using the equivariant riemann roch theorem 5 it follows from lemma 2 2 theorem 2 4 if m l is k stable then f is proper along any one parameter algebraic subgroup g 0 of g unless g 0 preserves m i e it is contained in the automorphism group of m 3 proving theorem 1 3 when aut 0 m l 1 in view of theorem 2 4 the k stability implies that f is proper along any one parameter algebraic subgroup of g hence our problem is whether or not the properness of f on g follows from the properness of f along any one parameter algebraic subgroup of g this is an algebraic problem in nature as in classical geometric invariant theory we deduce the cm stability from the k stability in two steps for simplicity we assume aut 0 m l 1 in this section and explain how to adapt the proof to the general case in the next section 5 i learned from chenyang xu that 2 10 and consequently 2 9 can be also proved by a purely algebraic method 8 lemma 3 1 let t be any maximal algebraic torus of g if the restriction f t is proper in the sense of 1 8 then m is cm stable with respect to l proof we prove it by contradiction suppose that we have a sequence i g such that f i stay bounded while j i diverge to recall the cartan decomposition g k t k where k u n 1 write i k itiki for ki k i k and ti t then we have that f tiki f i stay bounded while j tiki j i diverge to on the other hand since each ki is represented by unitary matrix we can show easily ti tiki log n 1 3 1 write d ti f ti f tiki using 3 1 and the definition of the k energy we can deduce d ti 1 n v m log nti n 0 nti m log ntiki n 0 ntiki o 1 the integrals on the right side are equal to m log nti n tiki nti m log ntiki n 0 nti n tiki the first integral above is bounded from below while the second is equal to m ti tiki ric 0 ric tiki n 1 a 1 ati n a tiki 3 2 using 3 1 and the fact that ric tiki is bounded from above we can show that the integral in 3 2 is uniformly bounded it follows that d ti is bounded from below similarly using the fact that ric ti is bounded from above one can show that d ti is bounded from above therefore we have f ti f tiki c it follows that f ti stay bounded while j ti diverge to we get a contra diction therefore in order to prove theorem 1 3 we only need to prove that f is proper on the maximal algebraic torus t the remaining arguments are identical to corresponding parts in ti 12 or ti 13 which is based on s paul s works pa 12 and pa 13 first we recall the chow coordinate and hyperdiscriminant of m pa 08 let g n n 1 n the grassmannian of all n n 1 dimensional subspaces in cpn we define zm p g n n 1 n p m 6 3 3 9 then zm is an irreducible divisor of g n n 1 n and determines a non zero homogeneous polynomial rm c m n 1 n 1 unique modulo scaling of degree n 1 d where mk l denotes the space of all k l matrices we call rm the chow coordinate or the m resultant of m next consider the segre embedding m cpn 1 cpn cpn 1 7 p m n n 1 where m k l denotes its dual space of mk l then we define ym h p m n n 1 tp m cpn 1 h for some p 3 4 then ym is a divisor in p m n n 1 of degree d n n 1 d this determines a homogeneous polynomial m in c mn n 1 unique modulo scaling of degree d we call m the hyperdiscriminant of m set r n 1 dd v cr m n 1 n 1 w cr mn n 1 where cr c k denotes the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree r on ck following pa 12 we associatem with the pair r m m in v w where r m rd m and m n 1 d m fix norms on v and w noth denoted by for simplicity we set pv w log w log v 3 5 the following was first observed by s paul but the proof below was pre sented by myself in ti 13 lemma 3 2 let b 7 b g gl 7 gl be the natural representation by left multiplication where gl denotes the space of all n 1 n 1 matrices then we have j pr m ir c 3 6 where i is the identity in gl and ir u gl r proof it is known cf pa 04 n 1 j n 1 m n 0 log rm 2 this is equivalent to n 1 d j r m n 0 d log r m 2 3 7 if we write sl n 1 c as a n 1 n 1 matrix ij with determinant one then the hilbert schmidt norm of is given by 2 n i j 0 2 10 clearly we have log n i 0 n j 0 ijsj 2 where sj 0 j n is an orthonormal basis by direct computations we can easily show log 2 m log n i 0 n j 0 ijsj 2 n 0 d c combining the above two with 3 7 we get 3 6 lemma 3 3 let v w and u be as above and g 0 be an one parameter alge braic subgroup then f is not proper on t resp g 0 if and only if the orbit of r m m r m ir under t resp g 0 has a limit point in p v w p 0 w p 0 u proof first we note that p v w p 0 w p 0 u is t invariant it follows from pa 08 that for all g we have f an pr m m c 3 8 where an 0 and c are uniform constants by lemma 3 2 and 3 8 we see that if f is not proper on t resp g 0 then there are i t resp g 0 such that pr m m i stay bounded while pr m ir i goes to in pa 08 s paul showed pr m m log tan 2 d r m m r m 0 and pr m ir log tan 2 d r m ir r m 0 where d denotes the distance in p v w with respect to the fubini study metric therefore the limits of i r m i r lie in p 0 u while limits of i r m m stay in p v w p 0 w the other direction can be easily proved by reversing the above arguments the lemma is proved now we deduce theorem 1 3 from lemma 3 3 if m is not cm stable with respect to l then there are v v w w u u with u 6 0 v 6 0 satisfying if we denote y v w 0 u and x r m m r m ir then y is in the closure of the t orbit of x choose t invariant hyperplanes v 0 v and u 0 u such that x e and y e 0 where e p v w p v 0 w p v u p v u 0 11 and e 0 p v w p v 0 w p 0 u p 0 u 0 clearly e 0 is a closed subspace of e and the orbit ty lies in e 0 also both e and e 0 are affine they are actually isomorphic to v 0 w v u 0 and v 0 w 0 u 0 respectively by taking an orbit in the closure of ty if necessary we may assume that ty is closed in e 0 then by a well known result of richardson cf pa 12 and also ti 13 there is an one parameter algebraic subgroup g 0 such that the closure of g 0 x contains a point in e 0 which is a subset of p v w p 0 w p 0 u by lemma 3 3 and theorem 2 4 this contradicts to the k stability ofm thus the proof of theorem 1 3 is completed 4 proving theorem 1 3 in general cases in this section we prove theorem 1 3 in full generality it is clear that only lemma 3 1 and lemma 3 3 need to be modified all other arguments in last section go through without change first we prove a generalized version of lemma 3 1 lemma 4 1 let t be any maximal algebraic torus of g if the restriction f t is proper in the following sense for any sequence i t f i whenever inf aut m l j i 4 1 then m is cm stable with respect to l proof we also prove it by contradiction suppose that we have a sequence i g such that f i stay bounded while inf aut m l j i diverge to as before we use the cartan decomposition g k t k where k u n 1 and write i k itiki for ki k i k and ti t then we have that f tiki f i stay bounded while j tiki j i diverge to using the arguments in the proof of lemma 3 1 we can also prove that for some constant c 0 f ti f tiki c it remains to prove inf aut m l j ti each ki is represented by a unitary matrix ab with ab 1 let sa ti za where a 0 n and za is the a th coordinate of cpn then all these sa form a basis of h 0 m l and we have ti log n a 0 sa 20 tiki log n a 0 n b 0 absb 20 12 it follows ti tiki log n 1 4 2 since is an automorphism of m we have ti ti tiki tiki 4 3 where is a function satisfying 0 0 1 it follows from 4 2 and 4 3 ti tiki log n 1 this implies that j ti j tiki is uniformly bounded therefore f ti stay bounded while inf aut m l j ti diverge to we get a contradiction in the following we will fix a maximal algebraic torus t 0 in aut 0 m l we will prove that the k stability implies f ti whenever inf t 0 j ti ti t 4 4 clearly it follows from this and lemma 4 1 that m is cm stable with respect to l we will adopt the notations from last section choose an algebraic subtorus t 1 of t such that t t 0 t 1 and t 1 is transversal t 0 lemma 4 2 let v w and u be those in lemma 3 3 if 4 4 is false then the orbit of r m m r m ir under t 1 has a limit point in p v w p 0 w p 0 u proof first we note that p v w p 0 w p 0 u ist 1 invariant if 4 4 is false then there is a sequence ti t such that f ti stays bounded while inf t 0 j ti diverge to write ti si i for si t 1 and i t 0 then f si f ti stays bounded while j si j ti 1 i inf t 0 j ti it follows from lemma 3 2 and 3 8 that pr m m si stay bounded while pr m ir si goes to then as we argued in the proof of lemma 3 3 the limits of si r m i r lie in p 0 u while limits of si r m m lie in p v w p 0 w the lemma is proved now we deduce theorem 1 3 in general cases from lemma 4 2 if m is not cm stable with respect to l there are v v w w u u with u 6 0 v 6 0 satisfying y is in the closure of the t 1 orbit of x where y v w 0 u and x r m m r m ir as before 13 choose t 1 invariant hyperplanes v 0 v and u 0 u such that x e and y e 0 where e p v w p v 0 w p v u p v u 0 and e 0 p v w p v 0 w p 0 u p 0 u 0 as before e 0 is a closed subspace of e the orbit t 1 y lies in e 0 and both e and e 0 are affine by taking an orbit in the closure of t 1 y if necessary we may assume that t 1 y is closed in e 0 then by a well known result of richardson cf pa 12 and also ti 13 there is an one parameter algebraic subgroup g 0 of t 1 such that the closure of g 0 x contains a point in e 0 which is a subset of p v w p 0 w p 0 u by lemma 3 3 and theorem 2 4 this contradicts to the k stability of m thus we have completed the proof of theorem 1 3 in general cases references alv 09 arezzo c lanave g and vedova a singularities and k semistability int math res
