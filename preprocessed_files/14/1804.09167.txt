complex variety up to isomorphism this paper introduces the polar group of a real form x of a complex variety y as a tool to distinguish such real forms this group is an invariant of x which encodes information about the residual divisors in the coordinate ring of y over the coordinate ring of x we calculate polar groups for various curves including the real line r 1 and the algebraic 1 sphere s 1 1 introduction a real form of an integral c domain b is any integral r domain a such that r is algebraically closed in a and b c r a a i a general problem is to classify the real forms of b up to isomorphism one birational invariant associated to a real form is the abelian group l k where k is the field of fractions of a with unit group k and l k i is the field of fractions of b with unit group l a key feature of this group is that c 1 c where c denotes the class of c l and c is the conjugate of c however this invariant will not distinguish between non isomorphic real forms which are birationally isomorphic in this article we study the quotient group l b k where b is the unit group of b this group is an invariant of the ring a which encodes information about the residual divisors in b over a we call it the polar group of a denoted a affine rings are of particular interest if a is finitely generated over r then spec a is a real form of spec b and we define spec a a if a is z graded then the grading extends to b and proj a is a real form of proj b we define proj a l 0 b 0 k 0 where l 0 l and k 0 k are the subfields of elements of degree zero and b 0 b l 0 an affine variety over any ground field is factorial if its coordinate ring is a unique factorization domain suppose that x is an affine r variety and y c x it can happen that x is factorial and y is not factorial that x is not factorial and y is factorial or that both x and y are factorial the algebraic spheres sn serve to illustrate these properties s 1 is a non factorial curve while its complexification c is factorial s 2 is a factorial surface while the complex surface c s 2 is not factorial s 3 and its complexification sl 2 c are both factorial the strongest results about polar groups are obtained when x or y is factorial if x is factorial then x is torsion free thm 5 5 if y is factorial thm 5 1 gives a criterion for x to be free abelian and gives a basis when this criterion is met in particular x is free abelian if both x and y are factorial cor 5 6 section 6 computes polar groups for various curves including s 1 as an application polar groups are used in 2 to prove that there is only one polynomial embedding of s 1 in r 2 up to the action of a plane automorphism 1 1 notation 1 the group of units of the ring r is denoted r 2 the multiplicative monoid r 0 of the ring r is denoted r 3 the polynomial ring in n variables over the ring r is denoted r n date november 9 2018 1 http arxiv org abs 1804 09167 v 2 4 let k r or c the automorphism group of b as a k algebra is autk b affine n space over k is ank and projective n space over k is p n k 5 the real n sphere sn is the algebraic r variety with coordinate ring r x 0 xn x 2 0 x 2 n 1 6 given z a bi c for a b r z a 2 b 2 7 the closed unit disk is d z c z 1 8 the upper half plane of the complex plane is h z c im z 0 2 conjugations 2 1 automorphisms consider any integral domain b containing c assume that gal c r z 2 acts on b by r algebra automorphisms and that the inclusion c b equivariant this is equivalent to the condition that b admits a real form gal c r acts on autc b by group theoretic conjugation and if a bgal c r then autr b autc b gal c r and autr a autc b gal c r let be the image of gal c r in autr b definition 2 1 a conjugation of b is an involution in the coset autc b i e an r algebra involution of b which restricts to complex conjugation on c let conj b be the set of all conjugations of b given autc b define noting that then conj b 1 note that the product of two elements of conj b is an element of autc b and if autc b is an involution which commutes with conj b then conj b given conj b let a b the fixed ring of then r a and r is algebraically closed in a since a c r in addition b is an a module and is an a module homomorphism given f b note that f f i f f a define f 1 1 2 f f and f 2 12 i f f then f 1 f 2 a and f f 1 if 2 consequently b a ia and a is a real form of b let g autc b and define the mapping adj g g by adj g g then adj g adj g 1 for every g g so there is an induced mapping g conj b given by g adj g g g 1 thus mapping g onto the conjugacy class of in conj b 2 2 affine and projective varieties proposition 2 2 if b c x 1 xn and conj b then b r x 1 x 1 xn xn i x 1 x 1 i xn xn proof let r b denote the subring r r x 1 x 1 xn xn i x 1 x 1 i xn xn we have b r b b i b b b b given n n define mn xe 11 xenn ej n e 1 en n then m m i m m r for m m 1 assume by induction that for some n 1 m m i m m r whenever m mn given m mn and j 1 j n we have xj xj m m i xj xj i m m 2 xjm xjm and i xj xj m m i m m xj xj 2 i xjm xjm it follows thatm m i m m r wheneverm mn 1 therefore f f i f f r for any monomial f in x 1 xn from this we conclude that r b 2 note that prop 2 2 shows that if b is affine over c and conj b then b is affine over r more precisely if b is generated by n elements over c then a b is generated by 2 n elements over r quite often we want to know if a can be generated by n elements for affine b let y spec b and x spec b the induced map y y is a con jugation of y and the fixed points of possibly empty correspond to the r rational points of x if a is a graded ring then proj a is a real form of proj b more generally conjugations and real forms can be defined for certain types of schemes over c see 4 exercise ii 4 7 two important open questions are 1 whether the number isomorphism classes of real forms of a complex rational surface is always finite see 1 and 2 whether an affine c variety can admit more than one compact real form 2 3 examples the following three examples are closely related example 2 3 the field of rational functions l c t has two real forms namely k 1 r t and k 2 r x y where x 2 y 2 1 0 to show k 1 6 k 2 it suffices to observe that k 1 is a formally real field but k 2 is not formally real see 3 lemma 10 10 let be standard conjugation on l i e z z for z c and t t let be the c automorphism of l defined by t t 1 and define a second conjugation of l by then k 1 l r t and k 2 l r t t 1 i t t 1 example 2 4 pn r is a real form of pn c for all n 0 for even n this is the only real form of projective space but for odd n there is a second consider the case n 1 see 1 for the general case let xr be the conic in p 2 r defined by x 20 x 2 1 x 2 2 0 and let xc be the conic in p 2 c defined by the same form then xr is a real form of xc if p 2 c p 2 c is standard conjugation then restricts to xc so this restriction is a conjugation of xc and fix xc since xc p 1 c we see that xr is a real form of p 1 c and xr 6 p 1 r the reader can check that if y 0 y 1 y 0 y 1 is standard conjugation on p 1 c then the non standard conjugation is given by where is the c automorphism y 0 y 1 y 1 y 0 i e y 0 y 1 y 1 y 0 example 2 5 let b c t t 1 be the ring of laurent polynomials then spec b c the punc tured complex line and autc b b z 2 where b acts by multiplication and z 2 interchanges t and t 1 there are three inequivalent real forms of c 1 define conj b by z z for z c and t t then b r t t 1 r x y where xy 1 geometrically c c is given by z z with fixed points fix r 2 define autc b by t t 1 and conj b by then b r t t 1 i t t 1 r x y where x 2 y 2 1 geometrically is given by z z 1 with fixed points fix s 1 3 define autc b by t t 1 and conj b by then b r t t 1 i t t 1 r x y where x 2 y 2 1 geometrically is given by z z 1 with fixed points fix 3 polar factorization hereafter we assume that a is a noetherian integral r domain in which r is algebraically closed and that b c r a is an integral domain in this case b is also noetherian note that if b is normal then a is normal in addition recall if b is a ufd and b c then a is a ufd 3 b is an integral extension of a of degree 2 given by b a i in this case b is an a module of rank 2 given by b a ia and the a module map sending i to i is a conjugation if k frac a and l frac b then l k i and k b a given f g b suppose that f f 1 if 2 for f 1 f 2 a the conjugate of f is f f 1 if 2 for any set s b s s s s the matrix form of f is nf f 1 f 2 f 2 f 1 the minimal algebraic relation of f over a is given by the minimal polynomial of nf note that nf n t f definition 3 1 f b has no real divisor if f r b and r a implies r a let b be the set of elements of b with no real divisor definition 3 2 a polar factorization of f b is a factorization of the form f h a h b the group b z 2 acts on b where b acts by multiplication and z 2 acts by f f observe the following properties 1 b b and a b a 2 given f g b if fg b then f b and g b 3 the action of on b restricts to b 1 f b f is irreducible b 4 b is generated as a monoid by a b and b 1 lemma 3 3 every element of b admits a polar factorization proof given g 0 b suppose that g 0 r 1 g 1 for r 1 a and g 1 b inductively write gn 1 rngn for rn a and gn b then g 0 b g 1 b g 2 b is an ascending chain of principal ideals since b is noetherian there exists n 0 such that gn 1 b gnb we thus have rn 1 gn 1 gn rn 1 gn 1 b gnb gn 1 b rn 1 b a a therefore gn 1 b and if r r 1 rn 1 then g 0 rgn 1 is a polar factorization in an integral domain r elements f g r are relatively prime if fr gr fgr when r is a ufd this coincides with the usual notion of relative primeness lemma 3 4 given f b if f and f are relatively prime then f b proof by lemma 3 3 f admits a polar factorization f h where a and h b then f h therefore hh fb f b f f b 2 hh b b a a it follows that f b the following is a special case of lemma 2 46 in 3 lemma 3 5 given f g a if f and g are relatively prime in a then f and g are relatively prime in b for an abelian group g the square torsion subgroup of g is g 2 1 g is square torsion free if its square torsion subgroup is trivial suppose that g is an abelian group which is torsion free in general g need not be free abelian however if g is finitely generated as a z module then g is free abelian 4 for a set s let f s be the free abelian group with basis s recall that dedekind showed any subgroup of a free abelian group is free abelian let u be a ufd let f frac u and let p be a complete set of representative prime elements in u then f u f p 4 the polar group of a let l be the unit group of l frac b and k the unit group of k frac a definition 4 1 the polar group of a is the quotient group l b k denoted a an equivalent definition is as follows let m b be the multiplicative submonoid m b a noting that m m and that m b b define a relation on b as follows f g if and only if f g m this is an equivalence relation and the equivalence classes f form an abelian group g where f 1 f since the map l a defined by f g f g is surjective and has kernel equal to b k we see that g a observe that if a is a field then b a i is also a field and a 1 we use the following notation 1 for any subset t a t a denotes the subgroup generated by t 2 for any subset s b s a denotes the set x x s and s denotes the subgroup s 3 if a is affine over r and x spec a then x a we make an analogous definition for projective varieties suppose that a is affine over r and is z graded a n zan extend the grading to b n zbn noting that b 0 is a subring of b then x proj a is a real form of y proj b define l 0 f g f g bn for some n z g 6 0 and k 0 k l 0 then l 0 is a subfield of l which is algebraically closed in l and k 0 is a subfield of k which is algebraically closed in k define the polar group of x by x l 0 b 0 k 0 we have l 0 b 0 k 0 l 0 l 0 b k l 0 b k b k l b k therefore proj a can be viewed as a subgroup of spec a example 4 2 consider the rings a r x r 1 and b c x c 1 since b is a ufd we see that l c x c g where g f c in particular ze 11 zenn f c corresponds to x z 1 e 1 x zn en g where ej z define subgroups h 1 h 2 g by h 1 x z z h and h 2 x z x z x r z c r r then g h 1 h 2 and k r h 2 therefore a 1 r h 1 f h the free abelian group consisting of monic rational functions on c all of whose zeros and poles lie in h example 4 3 continuing the preceding example note that the subgroup of c x of functions of degree zero are precisely those which extend to the riemann sphere c p 1 c in this way we see that p 1 r is the subgroup of a 1 r consisting of products of the form x z 1 e 1 x zn en where zj h and e 1 en 0 by dedekind s theorem p 1 r is a free abelian group for any fixed h a basis for p 1 r is given by x z x 1 z h therefore p 1 r f h i 5 remark 4 4 b can have distinct real forms and the definition of f depends on the particular real form a of b thus when more than one real form of b is being considered say a and a we will distinguish their equivalence classes by writing f a and f a similarly if a is a real form of b and a is a real form of b we also write f a and f a similarly we may write x a for x or x a for x in certain situations 4 1 localizations let s a be a multiplicatively closed set then s 1 a is an r domain which is a real form of s 1 b c r s 1 a define the multiplicatively closed set s b by s f b s fb for some s s then s 1 b s 1 b proposition 4 5 under the foregoing hypotheses a s 1 a a s a b if b is a ufd then a s a s 1 a proof consider the surjective homomorphism a s 1 a sending f a to f s 1 a since the kernel of is s a part a follows suppose that b is a ufd and consider the short exact sequence 1 s a a s 1 a 1 it must be shown that has a section let nonzero f s 1 b be given and write f b s for b b and s s since b is a ufd there exists t s 1 and g b such that b tg and gcd g s 1 note that g is uniquely determined up to associates and that f s 1 a g s 1 a define the function s 1 a a f s 1 a 7 g a since g is unique up to associates is well defined in addition it is easily checked that 1 a group homomorphism 2 is the identity on s 1 a and 3 is the identity on s 1 a this confirms part b 4 2 subalgebras proposition 4 6 let r a be a subalgebra and define r a f r f a a is a well defined group homomorphism b the kernel of is m t r where t c r r b c if t is factorially closed in b then r is a subgroup of a proof for part a f r g r f g r t m f a g a this shows that is well defined and it is clearly a homomorphism part b follows by definition let r r 0 by part b is injective if and only if r t m t and this equality holds if t is factorially closed in b 4 3 prime ideals let p a be a prime ideal such that pb is prime in b then s a p and s b pb are multiplicatively closed sets by prop 4 5 the sequence 1 b pb a a ap 1 is exact proposition 4 7 let b b pb be the standard surjection and define the function b pb a a p f a f a p then is a well defined surjective group homomorphism and the kernel of is m pb b a 6 proof is a well defined function since f s iff f b pb and s b in addition it is clear from the definition that is a surjective group homomorphism and that the kernel of is m pb b a 4 4 transversal generating sets recall that the action of b z 2 restricts to b 1 and that b is generated as a monoid by m b a and b 1 therefore b 1 a let t b 1 be a transversal of the action 1 given f b 1 let of denote the orbit of f given g b 1 let h t be such that g oh and let b be such that g h then g bh or g bh which implies g h or g h 1 we thus conclude that t b 1 a the set t is a transversal generating set of a 5 unique factorization domains 5 1 freeness criterion theorem 5 1 suppose that b is a ufd the following conditions are equivalent 1 every element of b has a unique polar factorization up to units 2 given f b f b if and only if gcd f f 1 3 given f g b f g if and only if fb gb 4 a is square torsion free 5 a is torsion free 6 a is a free abelian group when these conditions hold a basis for a is given by a transversal generating set proof the implications 6 implies 5 implies 4 are valid by definition assume that condition 4 holds and let f g b be such that f g write f g a for a a and b suppose that p b is prime and a pb if pb p b then p p p 1 implies p 1 so pb rb for some r a but then f g rb implies f rb or g rb contradicting the assumption that f g b therefore pb 6 p b it follows that a pb p b pp b since f g 6 pp b we may assume that f pb and g p b which implies that f g pb write a pp for b and write f pf and g pg for f g b then k b a in addition f g b implies f g b we have f g pf p g pp fg f g by induction on the maximum number of prime factors of f or g we conclude that fb gb therefore fb gb this proves 4 implies 3 assume that condition 3 holds and suppose that n 1 for some a and n 1 let f b be such that f since b is a ufd f admits a polar factorization f rh where r a and h b therefore f h and hn fn 1 by condition 3 hnb b h b f rh 1 this shows that 3 implies 5 therefore conditions 3 4 and 5 are equivalent given f b suppose that gcd f f 6 1 let p b be a prime such that f f pb then p b since m b b p 6 m and p 6 1 condition 3 implies p 2 6 1 meaning that pb 6 p b but then f pb p b pp b contradicting the fact that f b we conclude that gcd f f 1 this shows that 3 implies 2 assume that condition 2 holds suppose that 2 1 for a and write f for f b then f 2 m so there exist a a and b with f 2 a if a 6 a then there exists a prime p b with a pb since f 2 a we see that f 2 f 2 pb which implies f f pb however 2 implies gcd f f 1 since f b therefore a a and f 2 b gives f b and f 1 this shows that 2 implies 4 therefore conditions 2 5 are equivalent 1 here we invoke the axiom of choice 7 assume that conditions 2 5 hold since b is a ufd it satisfies the accp by lemma 3 3 every element of b admits a polar factorization let f g for a and f g b then f g and condition 3 implies fb gb write g f for b then f f so k b a and a b therefore conditions 2 5 imply 1 conversely assume that condition 1 holds and that f g for f g b then f g a for b and a a which implies gg f a g since these are polar factorizations condition 1 implies fb gb and condition 3 holds therefore conditions 1 5 are equivalent assume that conditions 1 5 hold let t b 1 be a transversal of the action suppose that f 1 fn t are distinct n 0 and let e 1 en n be nonzero then f fe 11 fenn b in order to see this let r a be such that f rb if r is a non unit let p b be a prime with r pb since each fj is irreducible we see that pb fjb for some j therefore condition 3 implies p 2 fj 2 6 1 however r p b as well so r pb p b if pb p b then p 2 1 as above which is not the case therefore p b frb for some r 6 j but then fr fj 1 which means that fr is in the orbit of fj a contradiction therefore r a and f b as claimed now suppose that f 1 e 1 fs es fs 1 es 1 fn en 1 for distinct elements fj t n 0 and nonzero ej n then f 1 e 1 fs es f s 1 es 1 f n en 1 if g fe 11 fess f es 1 s 1 f enn then g 1 and property implies g b by condition 3 it follows that gb b therefore g b implies fj b for each j this is only possible if n 0 since b t therefore there are no relations among elements of t in addition it was shown in sect 2 that t generates a therefore a is a free abelian group with basis t this shows that conditions 1 5 imply 6 and completes the proof of the theorem 5 2 the case a is a ufd lemma 5 2 assume that a is a ufd and let f b be given write f f 1 if 2 for f 1 f 2 a then f b if and only if gcd f 1 f 2 1 proof if f 1 f 2 ra for r a r 6 a then f rb implies f 6 b therefore f b implies gcd f 1 f 2 1 conversely assume that gcd f 1 f 2 1 and let f rb for r a if f rg for g b then f 1 f 2 ra implies ra a therefore f b lemma 5 3 assume that a is a ufd if f b then fn b for each integer n 0 proof let f nf be the matrix form of f f 1 if 2 and suppose that f n pg for some integer n 1 where p a is prime and g ng for g b let a a pa be the standard surjection then f is a nonzero nilpotent matrix over the integral domain a pa therefore det f tr f 0 det f tr f pa f 21 f 22 2 f 1 pa f 1 f 2 pa but this is a contradiction since lemma 5 2 implies that f 1 and f 2 are relatively prime there fore no such integer n exists it follows that if fn fn 1 i f n 2 for f n 1 f n 2 a then gcd fn 1 f n 2 1 lemma 5 2 implies f n b for all n 1 lemma 5 4 assume that a is a ufd given f g b let fg rh be a polar factorization a f f gg pa for every prime p a dividing r b if gcd f f gg 1 then fg b proof suppose that p a is a prime dividing r let the matrix forms of f g r h be given by f g r h respectively and let s m 2 a be such that r ps then fg psh implies det f det g p 2 det sh since g b lemma 5 2 implies g 6 pt for any t m 2 a 8 therefore det f pa and by symmetry det g pa this proves part a and part b is directly implied by part a theorem 5 5 if a is a ufd then a is torsion free proof let f b be such that f n 1 for n 1 by lemma 3 3 f admits a polar factorization f rh r a h b we have hn 1 which implies hn m by lemma 5 3 we also have hn b therefore hn m b b h b f h 1 combining thm 5 5 with thm 5 1 gives the following corollary 5 6 if a is a ufd and b is a ufd then a is a free abelian group and a basis for a is a transversal generating set in particular this corollary implies that if b is a ufd and b c then a is a free abelian group corollary 5 7 s 1 is not factorial proof let a r x y with x 2 y 2 1 and let b c t t 1 where t x iy then t t 1 given z c with z 1 we have t z 1 t z t 1 z 1 z 1 t 1 t z t z therefore t z 2 1 and a has torsion by thm 5 5 s 1 is not factorial corollary 5 8 there is no dominant morphism r s 1 equivalently s 1 cannot be parametrized by laurent polynomials r t t 1 proof let a r t t 1 if there exists a dominant morphism r s 1 then there is a subalgebra r a with r r s 1 if t c r r and b c r a then b c t t 1 and t c s s 1 for some s b we my assume that s tm for some positive m z consider the group homomorphism r a since a is a ufd a is torsion free the proof of cor 5 7 shows s r has order 2 for each c with 1 it follows that s r tm a 1 c 1 choose 6 1 then tm a 1 implies tm a for some c but then tm a c t r t r r a contradiction 6 computations 6 1 two real forms of p 1 r the two real forms of p 1 c are p 1 r and xr which is the conic in p 2 r defined by x 20 x 2 1 x 2 2 0 see example 2 4 it was shown in example 4 3 that p 1 r f h i the homogeneous coordinate ring of xr is a r x 0 x 1 x 2 x 2 0 x 2 1 x 2 2 and if k frac a then k 0 r x 1 x 0 x 2 x 0 where x 1 x 0 2 x 2 x 0 2 1 0 if b c x 0 x 1 x 2 x 2 0 x 2 1 x 2 2 then b 0 c and l c x 1 ix 2 x 0 c 2 and l 0 c x 1 ix 2 x 0 c 1 let t x 1 ix 2 x 0 then tt 1 which implies t t 1 from example 4 2 recall that l 0 c g where g f c given z c let t z t z k 0 we have t z t z t z t 1 z z t 1 t z t z 1 t z t z 1 z 1 t 9 let p l 0 xr be the natural surjection and let h l 0 be the subgroup h t z z d since z 1 if and only if z 1 1 it follows that p h xr in addition z z 1 if and only if z d i e z 1 let u d be the interior of d and let z d be the arc z ei 0 then p is bijective on the subgroup t z z u z which by dedekind s theorem is a free abelian group by identifying antipodal points of d we conclude that xr is the free abelian group generated by the real projective plane xr f p 2 r see fig 1 6 2 localizations of r x example 6 1 a s 1 r x where s x a 1 e 1 x an en ej n for a 1 an r recall from example 4 2 that r x f h since s s and s 1 prop 4 5 implies a s 1 r x r x f h for example if s x 1 e 1 x 1 e 2 e 1 e 2 n then spec a r the twice punctured real line see see fig 2 a example 6 2 a r x x 2 1 1 then b c x x i 1 x i 1 which is the coordinate ring of c the twice punctured complex line if s x 2 1 m m n then a s 1 r x and s x i m x i n m n n by prop 4 5 it follows that a f h i see fig 2 b example 6 3 a r x p where p x 2 1 r x then b s 1 c x where s is the set of products of primes of b not associate with x i or x i since x i 1 x i it follows that given f b f x i e for some e z therefore a z generated by x i i h i a p 1 r 1 1 p 2 r b xr x 2 0 x 2 1 x 2 2 0 figure 1 group generators for two real forms of p 1 c i h a x 2 1 y 1 i h i b x 2 1 y 1 figure

by prop 7 1 below a is a ufd therefore by cor 5 6 a is a free abelian group we have l c x iy and k r x y there is a natural surjection xr a where t z x iy z for z c see example 6 1 the kernel of is t therefore a is generated by the punctured real projective plane which is homeomorphic to an open mo bius band a f p 2 r 0 see fig 3 b example 6 6 a r x y where x 2 y 2 1 0 write b c t t 1 where t x iy noting that t 1 t we have b 1 ctn t z c z c n z given z c let f t z and suppose that g of the orbit of f where g ctn t w for c w c and n z there exists b with g b f write b tm for c and m z if 1 then g bf and we have ctn t w tm t z w z if 6 1 then g bf and we have 1 ctn t w tm t z tm t 1 z tm 1 z t z 1 w z 1 since z 1 z if and only if z 1 it follows that the set t t z z d z 6 0 is a transversal for the action however t is not a minimal generating set as will be shown let v d and u z c 0 z 1 define subgroups g h a by g t z z v and h t z z u since d u v we see that a gh line 1 shows t z 1 t z 1 and this implies t 2 1 for v therefore 2 1 for every g in addition note that t 2 1 2 xt and t 2 1 2 iyt therefore given v t t t 2 t 1 2 x re t m t t 1 t similarly t t t 2 t 1 2 i y im t m t t 1 t therefore if e is the arc e t ei 0 2 then g e on the other hand h f u in order to show this assume that there is a relation among elements of u then there exists a laurent polynomial p t a such that p t is not a unit and all the nonzero roots of p t are in u let z u be such that p t t z b as in line 1 we have p t p t t z b t z 1 b therefore both z and z 1 are in u which is a contradiction consequently no such p t exists since g is torsion andh is free abelian it follows that g h 1 and that a g h a is generated by the punctured disc d 0 with boundary identifications as indicated in fig

r p 1 x pn x a r x note that c is a rational curve by lu roth s theorem if t c r r then t c p 1 x pn x b c x and m t a c t r c therefore m t r 1 by prop 4 6 c is a subgroup of r x f h by dedekind s theorem c is a free abelian group for a given polynomial curve c we seek a description of a basis of c in terms of the basis h for example consider the cuspidal cubic curve c defined by r r x 2 x 3 p x r x p 0 0 then t c x 2 x 3 p x c x p 0 0 and t is the set of f t with no conjugate roots i e f z 0 implies f z 6 0 given monic f t if f x w 1 x wn wj c r then the condition f 0 0 is equivalent to the condition w 11 w 1 n 0 assume that w 1 ws h and ws 1 wn 6 h since x z x z 1 for any z c it follows that the subgroup c of r x is generated by elements of the form x z 1 x zs x zs 1 1 x zn 1 z 1 zn h where z 11 z 1 s z 1 s 1 z 1 n 0 and z 1 zs zs 1 zn however many such products correspond to reducible elements of t for example if f t and deg f 4 then f t 1 if and only if w 1 w 1 w 3 w 4 6 0 finding a basis for c of this form thus requires a good description of irreducibles in t which to the author s knowledge is lacking 7 appendix 7 1 two ufds the purpose of this section is to show the following proposition 7 1 the rings r x y x 2 y 2 1 and r x y z x 2 y 2 z 2 are ufds proof let f be a formally real field given nonzero a f let c be the affine plane curve over f defined by x 2 y 2 a 2 0 then c is irreducible over f let c be the projective extension of c then c is given by the equation x 2 y 2 a 2 t 2 x 2 y 2 at 2 0 12 in projective coordinates x y t since a 6 0 and f is formally real c has no f rational points by samuel s criterion cited below it follows that the ring f x y x 2 y 2 a 2 is a ufd this is true in particular if f r and a 1 likewise if f r z r 1 and a z then f is a formally real field see 3 lemma 10 10 and the ring b r z x y x 2 y 2 z 2 is a ufd define the subring b r z x y x 2 y 2 z 2 and define the multiplicative subset s b by s r z 0 if p s denotes the set of linear and irreducible quadratic polynomials in r z r 1 then s is generated by p it is easy to check that for each p p the ring b pb is a domain therefore elements of p are prime in b since b s 1 b it follows by nagata s criterion cited below that b is a ufd theorem 7 2 samuel 6 thm 5 1 a let c be an irreducible conic in the affine plane defined over a field k let a be its affine coordinate ring over k and let c be the projective extension of c if c has no k rational point then a is a ufd theorem 7 3 nagata 5 let a be an integral domain and s a the multiplicative system generated by any family of prime elements of a if s 1 a is a ufd then a is a ufd 7 2 remarks and questions 1 the elliptic curve with j invariant 1728 has two real forms c 1 and c 2 given by y 2 x x 2 1 and y 2 x x 2 1 what are c 1 and c 2 2 since s 2 is factorial thm 5 5 shows that s 2 is torsion free but since its complexification is not factorial we do not know if s 2 is a free abelian group to explore this problem one can consider whether certain subgroups are free abelian for example the subgroup generated by c 1 x c 2 y c 3 z c 4 where x 2 y 2 z 2 1 and cj c the inherent difficulty is seen in the group relation x y iz 1 x y iz 1 2 x 2 x iz x iz 3 since sets of the same cardinality generate free abelian groups which are isomorphic as groups it is natural to look for a stronger notion of isomorphism for polar groups one which encodes some of the underlying topology and geometry for example in the case of the polynomial ring c x the set of prime divisors x z z c forms an algebraic variety v which is isomorphic to c in this case f v can be given the structure of a topological group by declaring that if u is a system of basic open sets on v then the subgroups f u u u form a system of basic open sets on f v the polar group a is a free quotient of f v and takes the quotient topology this idea can be extended to case where b is a ufd and the set of prime elements of b has the structure of an infinite dimensional c variety ind variety clearly these ideas require further development references 1 m benzerga real structures on rational surfaces and automorphisms acting
