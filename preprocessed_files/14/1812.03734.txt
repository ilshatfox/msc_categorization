cohomology spaces associated to the arithmetic groups sl 3 z and gl 3 z with coefficients in any highest weight representation m have been computed where denotes their highest weight consequently we obtain detailed information of their eisenstein cohomology with coefficients in m when m is not self dual the eisenstein cohomology coincides with the cohomology of the underlying arithmetic group with coefficients in m in particular for such a large class of representations we can explicitly describe the cohomology of these two arithmetic groups we accomplish this by studying the cohomology of the boundary of the borel serre compactification and their euler characteristic with coefficients in m at the end we employ our study to discuss the existence of ghost classes contents 1 introduction

let g be a split semisimple group defined over q then for every arithmetic subgroup g q one can define the corresponding locally symmetric space s g r k where k denotes the maximal connected compact subgroup of g r in this context we can consider the borel serre compactification s of s see 4 whose boundary s is a union of spaces indexed by the conjugacy classes of q parabolic subgroups of g for

subgroups we will denote this set by pq g one can write the boundary s as a union 1 s p pq g p the irreducible representation m of g associated to a highest weight defines a sheaf over s denoted by m that is defined over q this sheaf can be extended in a natural way to a sheaf in the borel serre compactification s and we can therefore consider the restriction to the boundary of the borel serre compactification and to each face of the boundary obtaining sheaves in s and p the aforementioned covering defines a spectral sequence abutting to the cohomology of the boundary 2 e p q 1 prk p p 1 hq p m h p q s m where prk p denotes the parabolic rank of p the dimension of its q split component in this article we present an explicit description of this spectral sequence to discuss in detail the boundary and eisenstein cohomology for the particular rank two cases sl 3 and gl 3 since its development cohomology of arithmetic groups has been proved to be a valuable tool in analyzing the relations between the theory of automorphic forms and the arithmetic properties of the associated locally symmetric spaces a very common goal is to describe the cohomology h s m in terms of automorphic forms the study of boundary and eisenstein cohomology of arithmetic groups has many number theoretic applications as an example one can see applications on the algebraicity of certain quotients of special values of l functions in 11 the main tools and idea to study the boundary cohomology of arithmetic groups have been developed by the second author in a series of articles 11 12 14 this article is no exception in taking the hunt a little further especially we make use of the techniques developed in 14 in a way this article is a continuation of the work carried out by the second author in 12 in section 4 the cohomology of the boundary of sl 3 z has been described after introducing the necessary notations and tools in section 2 and section 3 in order to achieve the details about the space of eisenstein cohomology of the two mentioned arithmetic groups we make use of their euler characteristics in section 5 we discuss this in detail the importance of euler charcateristic to study the space of eisenstein cohomology has been discussed by the third author in 19 for more details about euler characteristic of arithmetic groups see 17 18 in section 6 we compute the space of eisenstein cohomology of the arithmetic groups sl 3 z and gl 3 z with coefficients in m one of the most interesting take aways among others of these two sections is the intricate relation between the spaces of automorphic forms of sl 2 and the boundary and eisenstein cohomology spaces of sl 3 in section 7 we carry out the discussion of existence of ghost classes in sl 3 z and gl 3 z in detail with respect to any highest weight representation ghost classes were introduced by a borel 3 in 1984 for details and exact definition of these classes see section 7 later on these classes have appeared in the work of the second author for example at the end of the article 12 with emphasis to the case gl 3 it is mentioned that the ghost classes appear if some l values vanish the order of vanishing does not play a role but this may change in higher rank case the author further added that this aspect is worthy of investigation the importance of their investigation has been occasionally pointed out since then these classes have been studied boundary and eisenstein cohomology 3 at times however the general theory of these classes has been slow in coming we couldn t trace down the complete analysis of ghost classes in these two specific cases in complete generality i e for arbitrary coefficient system however in case of sl 4 z these classes have been discussed by rohlfs in 25 in general for sln franke developed a method to construct ghost classes in 7 later on using the method developed in 7 kewenig and rieband have found ghost classes for the orthogonal and symplectic groups when the coefficient system is trivial see 20 more recently these classes have been discussed by the first and last author in the case of rank two orthogonal shimura varieties in 1 and by the last author in case of gsp 4 in 23 and gu 2 2 in 24 the main results of this article are the following theorem 11 where the euler characteristic of sl 3 z is calculated with respect to every finite dimensional highest weight representation theorem 12 where the boundary cohomology with coefficients in every finite dimensional highest weight representation is described theorem 15 that shows that the euler characteristic of the boundary cohomology is half the euler characteristic of the eisenstein cohomology theorem 16 where we describe the eisenstein cohomology for every finite dimensional high est weight representation theorem 26 that shows that there are no ghost classes unless possibly in degree two for certain nonregular highest weights in this paper we do not refer to and do not use transcendental methods i e we do not write down convergent or even non convergent infinite series and do not use the principle of analytic continuation this allows us to work with coefficient systems which are q vector spaces only at one place we refer to the eichler shimura isomorphism but this reference is not really relevant at one point we refer to a deep theorem of bass milnor serre 2 to get the complete description of the eisenstein cohomology transcendental arguments would allow us to avoid this reference see 13 and 26 in theorem 26 we leave open whether in a certain case ghost classes might exist in a letter to a goncharov the second author has outlined an argument that shows that there are no ghost classes but this argument depends on transcendental methods this will be discussed in a forthcoming paper 2 basic notions this section provides quick review to the basic properties of sl 3 and gl 3 and familiarize the reader with the notations to be used throughout the article we discuss the corresponding locally symmetric space weyl group the associated spectral sequence and kostant representatives of the standard parabolic subgroups 2 1 structure theory let t be the maximal torus of sl 3 given by the group of diagonal matrices and be the corresponding root system of type a 2 let 1 2 3 x t be the usual coordinate functions on t we will use the additive notation for the abelian group x t of characters of t the root system is given by where and denote the set of positive and negative roots of sl 3 respectively and 1 3 1 2 2 3 then the system of simple roots is defined by 1 1 2 2 2 3 the fundamental weights associated to this root system are given by 1 1 and 2 1 2 the irreducible finite dimensional representations of sl 3 are determined by their highest weight which in this case are the elements of the form 4 jitendra bajpai gu nter harder ivan horozov and matias moya giusti m 1 1 m 2 2 with m 1 m 2 non negative integers the weyl group w of is given by the symmetric group s 3 the above defined root system determines a set of proper standard q parabolic subgroups pq sl 3 p 0 p 1 p 2 where p 0 is a minimal and p 1 p 2 are maximal q parabolic subgroups of sl 3 to be more precise we write p 1 a 0 0 sl 3 a p 2 a 0 0 sl 3 a for every q algebra a and p 0 is simply the group given by p 1 p 2 the set pq sl 3 is a set of representatives for the conjugacy classes of q parabolic subgroups of sl 3 consider the maximal connected compact subgroup k so 3 sl 3 r and the arithmetic subgroup sl 3 z then s denotes the orbifold sl 3 r k note that in terms of differential geometry s is not a locally symmetric space this is because of the torsion elements in 2 2 spectral sequence let s denote the borel serre compactification of s see 4 follow ing 1 the boundary of this compactification s s s is given by the union of faces indexed by the conjugacy classes of q parabolic subgroups consider the irreducible representation m of sl 3 associated with a highest weight this representation is defined over q and determines a sheaf m over s by applying the direct image functor associated to the inclusion i s s we obtain a sheaf on s and since this inclusion is a homotopy equivalence see 4 it induces an isomorphism h s m h s i m from now on i m will be simply denoted by m in this paper one of our immediate goals is to make a thorough study of the cohomology space of the boundary h s m the covering 1 defines a spectral sequence in cohomology abutting to the cohomology of the boundary to be more precise one has the spectral sequence defined by 2 in the previous sec tion to be able to study this spectral sequence we need to understand the cohomology spaces hq p m and this can be done by making use of a certain decomposition to present the aforementioned decomposition we need to introduce some notations let p pq sl 3 be a standard q parabolic subgroup and m be the corresponding levi quotient then m and k m will denote the image under the canonical projection p m of the groups p q and k p r respectively m will denote the group m x q m 2 where x q m denotes the set of q characters of m then m and k m are contained in m r and we define the locally symmetric space of the levi quotient m by sm m m r km on the other hand let wp w w w n be the set of weyl representatives of the parabolic p see 21 where n is the lie algebra of the unipotent radical of p and n denotes the set of roots whose root space is contained in n if x t denotes half of the sum of the positive roots in this case this is just 1 3 and w w p boundary and eisenstein cohomology 5 e 2 3 1 2 1 2 3 1 3 2 1 3 figure 1 weyl elements blue and red arrows denote the simple reflections s 1 and s 2 respectively si acts from the left on the element that appears on the tale and the result of this action appears at the head of the respective arrow then the element w w is a highest weight of an irreducible representation mw of m and defines a sheaf m w over s m then we have a decomposition hq p m w wp hq w sm m w 2 3 kostant representatives of standard parabolics in the next table we list all the el ements of the weyl group along with their lengths and the preimages of the simple roots the preimages will be useful to determine the sets of weyl representatives for each parabolic subgroup w w 1 1 1 2 e e 0 1 2 s 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 s 2 2 3 1 1 2 2 s 2 s 1 1 3 2

the sets of weyl representatives for the maximal parabolics p 1 and p 2 are given by wp 1 e s 1 s 1 s 2 and w p 2 e s 2 s 2 s 1 6 jitendra bajpai gu nter harder ivan horozov and matias moya giusti we now record for each standard parabolic p and weyl representative w wp the expression w in the convenient setting so that it can be used to obtain lemma 1 and lemma 3 which commence in the next few pages let be given by m 1 1 m 2 2 then the kostant representatives for parabolics p 0 p 1 and p 2 are listed respectively where we make use of the notations m 1 1 2 2 3 m 1 1 2 2 3 m 2 1 2 1 2 m 2 1 2

spectral sequence whose terms are given by the cohomology of the faces associated to each standard parabolic subgroup in this section we expose for each standard parabolic p and irreducible representation m of the levi subgroup m p with highest weight a parity condition to be satisfied in order to have nontrivial cohomology h sm m here s m denotes the symmetric space associated to m and m is the sheaf in sm determined by m 3 1 borel subgroup we begin by studying the parity condition imposed on the face associated to the minimal parabolic p 0 of sl 3 the levi subgroup of p 0 is the two dimensional torus m 0 t of diagonal matrices to get nontrivial cohomology the finite group m 0 k m 0 has to act trivially on m because otherwise m 0 therefore the following three elements 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 m 0 km 0 boundary and eisenstein cohomology 7 must act trivially on m so that the sheaf m is nonzero by using this fact one can deduce the following lemma 1 let be given by m 1 1 m 2 2 if m 1 or m 2 is odd then the corresponding local system m in s m 0 is 0 note that the to be considered in this paper will be of the form w for w wp 0 we denote by w 0 the set of weyl elements w such that w do not satisfy the condition of lemma 1 remark 2 for notational convenience we simply use i to denote the boundary face pi asso ciated to the parabolic subgroup pi and the arithmetic group for i 0 1 2 in addition we will drop the use of from the s and s and likewise from the other notations 3 1 1 cohomology of the face 0 in this case h q sm 0 m w 0 for every q 1 the set of weyl representatives wp 0 w and the lengths of its elements are between 0 and 3 as shown in the table and figure above we know hq 0 m w wp 0 hq w sm 0 m w w wp 0 w q h 0 sm 0 m w therefore h 0 0 m h 0 sm 0 m h 1 0 m h 0 sm 0 m s 1 h 0 sm 0 m s 2 h 2 0 m h 0 sm 0 m s 1 s 2 h 0 sm 0 m s 2 s 1 h 3 0 m h 0 sm 0 m s 1 s 2 s 1 and for every q 4 the cohomology groups hq 0 m 0 3 2 maximal parabolic subgroups in this section we study the parity conditions for the max imal parabolics let i 1 2 then mi gl 2 and in this setting k mi o 2 is the orthogonal group and mi gl 2 z therefore smi s gl 2 gl 2 z gl 2 r o 2 r 0 let 1 2 denote the usual characters in the torus t of diagonal matrices of gl 2 write 1 2 1 2 and 1 2 1 2 consider the irreducible representation va n of gl 2 with highest weight a n in this expression a and nmust be congruent modulo 2 and va n sym a q 2 det n a 2 is the tensor product of the a th symmetric power of the standard representation and the determinant to the n a 2 th power this representation defines a sheaf v a n in s gl 2 and also in the locally symmetric space sgl 2 gl 2 z gl 2 r so 2 r 0 if z t denotes the center of gl 2 one has 1 0 0 1 gl 2 z z r so 2 r 0 8 jitendra bajpai gu nter harder ivan horozov and matias moya giusti and therefore this element must act trivially on va n in order to have v a n 6 0 i e if n is odd then v a n 0 so we are just interested in the case in which n and therefore a is even on the other hand if a 0 va n is one dimensional and 1 0 0 1 gl 2 z o 2 r 0 has the effect that the space of global sections of v 0 n is 0 when n 2 is odd we summarize the above discussion in the following lemma 3 let i be 1 or 2 for w wpi let w be given by a mi n mi where mi 1 2 i i 1 and mi 1 2 i i 1 if n is odd the corresponding sheaf m w is 0 as a and n are congruent modulo 2 we should have a and n even in order to have a non trivial coefficient system v a n moreover if a 0 and n 2 is odd then h smi m w 0 we denote the set of weyl elements for which h smi m w 6 0 by w i now if b gl 2 is the usual borel subgroup and t b is the subgroup of diagonal matrices one can consider the exact sequence in cohomology h 0 st h 0 n va n h 1 c s gl 2 v a n h 1 s gl 2 v a n h 0 st h 1 n va n where n is the lie algebra of the unipotent radical n of b by using an argument similar to the one presented in lemma 1 we get h 1 c s gl 2 v a n h 1 s gl 2 v a n if a 2 6 n 2 mod 2 h 1 s gl 2 v a n h 1 s gl 2 v a n if a 2 n 2 mod 2 3 in the following subsections we make note of the cohomology groups associated to the maximal parabolic subgroups p 1 and p 2 which will be used in the computations involved to determine the boundary cohomology in the next section 3 2 1 cohomology of the face 1 in this case the levi m 1 is isomorphic to gl 2 and therefore hq sm 1 m w 0 for every q 2 see the example 2 1 3 in subsection 2 1 2 of 15 for the particular case of gl 2 or theorem 11 4 4 in 4 for a more general statement the set of weyl representatives is given by wp 1 e s 1 s 1 s 2 where the length of the elements are respectively 0 1 2 by definition hq 1 m w wp 1 hq w sm 1 m w hq sm 1 m h q 1 sm 1 m s 1 h q 2 sm 1 m s 1 s 2 therefore h 0 1 m h 0 sm 1 m h 1 1 m h 1 sm 1 m h 0 sm 1 m s 1 h 2 1 m h 1 sm 1 m s 1 h 0 sm 1 m s 1 s 2 h 3 1 m h 1 sm 1 m s 1 s 2 and for every q 4 the cohomology groups hq 1 m 0 boundary and eisenstein cohomology 9 3 2 2 cohomology of the face 2 in this case the levi m 2 is isomorphic to gl 2 and therefore hq sm 2 m w 0 for every q 2 the set of weyl representatives is given by w p 2 e s 2 s 2 s 1 where the lengths of the elements are respectively 0 1 2 by definition hq 2 m w wp 2 hq w sm 2 m w hq sm 2 m h q 1 sm 2 m s 2 h q 2 sm 2 m s 2 s 1 therefore h 0 2 m h 0 sm 2 m h 1 2 m h 1 sm 2 m h 0 sm 2 m s 2 h 2 2 m h 1 sm 2 m s 2 h 0 sm 2 m s 2 s 1 h 3 2 m h 1 sm 2 m s 2 s 1 and for every q 4 the cohomology groups hq 2 m 0 4 boundary cohomology in this section we calculate the cohomology of the boundary by giving a complete description of the spectral sequence the covering of the boundary of the borel serre compactification defines a spectral sequence in cohomology e p q 1 prk p p 1 hq p m h p q s m and the nonzero terms of e p q 1 are for 4 p q 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 more precisely e 0 q 1 2 i 1 hq i m 2 i 1 w wpi hq w smi m w 5 e 1 q 1 h q 0 m w wp 0 w q h 0 sm 0 m w since sl 3 is of rank two the spectral sequence has only two columns namely e 0 q 1 e 1 q 1 and to study the boundary cohomology the task reduces to analyze the following morphisms 6 e 0 q 1 d 0 q 1 e 1 q 1 where d 0 q 1 is the differential map and the higher differentials vanish one has e 0 q 2 ker d 0 q 1 and e 1 q 2 coker d 0 q 1 10 jitendra bajpai gu nter harder ivan horozov and matias moya giusti in addition due to be in rank 2 situation the spectral sequence degenerates in degree 2 therefore we can use the fact that 7 hk s m p q k e p q 2 in other words let us now consider the short exact sequence 0 e 1 q 1 2 h q s m e 0 q 2 0 8 from now on we will denote by r 1 h 1 m h 0 m and r 2 h 2 m h 0 m the natural restriction morphisms 4 1 case 1 m 1 0 and m 2 0 trivial coefficient system following lemma 1 and lemma 3 from section 3 we get w 1 e w 2 e and w 0 e s 1 s 2 s 1 by using 5 we record the values of e 0 q 1 and e 1 q 1 for the distinct values of q below note that following 4 we know that for q 4 e i q 1 0 for i 0 1 9 e 0 q 1 h 0 sm 1 m e h 0 sm 2 m e q q q 0 0 otherwise and 10 e 1 q 1 h 0 sm 0 m e q q 0 h 0 sm 0 m s 1 s 2 s 1 q q 3 0 otherwise we now make a thorough analysis of 6 to get the complete description of the spaces e 0 q 2 and e 1 q 2 which will give us the cohomology h q s m we begin with q 0 4 1 1 at the level q 0 observe that the short exact sequence 8 reduces to 0 h 0 s m e 0 0 2 0 to compute e 0 0 2 consider the differential d 0 0 1 e 0 0 1 e 1 0 1 following 9 and 10 we have d 0 0 1 q q q and we know that the differential d 0 0 1 is surjective see 11 therefore e 0 0 2 ker d 0 0 1 q and e 1 0 2 coker d 0 0 1 0 11 hence we get h 0 s m q boundary and eisenstein cohomology 11 4 1 2 at the level q 1 following 11 in this case our short exact sequence 8 reduces to 0 h 1 s m e 0 1 2 0 and we need to compute e 0 1 2 consider the differential d 0 1 1 e 0 1 1 e 1 1 1 and following 9 and 10 we observe that d 0 1 1 is a map between zero spaces therefore we obtain e 0 1 2 0 and e 1 1 2 0 as a result we get h 1 s m 0 4 1 3 at the level q 2 following the similar process as in level q 1 we get e 0 2 2 0 and e 1 2 2 0 12 this results into h 2 s m 0 4 1 4 at the level q 3 following 12 in this case the short exact sequence 8 reduces to 0 h 3 s m e 0 3 2 0 and we need to compute e 0 3 2 consider the differential d 0 3 1 e 0 3 1 e 1 3 1 and following 9 and 10 we have d 0 3 1 0 q therefore e 0 3 2 0 and e 1 3 2 q 13 this gives us h 3 s m 0 4 1 5 at the level q 4 following 13 in this case the short exact sequence 8 reduces to 0 q h 4 s m e 0 4 2 0 and we need to compute e 0 4 2 consider the differential d 0 4 1 e 0 4 1 e 1 4 1 and following 9 and 10 we have d 0 4 1 0 0 therefore e 0 4 2 0 and e 1 4 2 0 and we get h 4 s m q we can summarize the above discussion as follows hq s m q for q 0 4 0 otherwise 12 jitendra bajpai gu nter harder ivan horozov and matias moya giusti 4 2 case 2 m 1 0 m 2 6 0 m 2 even following the parity conditions established in section 3 we find that w 1 e w 2 e s 2 s 1 and w 0 e s 1 s 2 s 1 following 5 we write e 0 q 1 h 0 sm 2 m e q 0 h 1 sm 1 m e q 1 h 1 sm 2 m s 2 s 1 q 3 0 otherwise and 14 e 1 q 1 h 0 sm

isomorphism d 0 0 1 h 0 sm 2 m e h 0 sm 0 m e therefore we obtain e 0 0 2 0 and e 1 0 2 0 as a result we get h 0 s m 0 4 2 2 at the level q 1 in this case the short exact sequence 8 becomes 0 h 1 s m e 0 1 2 0 consider the differential d 0 1 1 e 0 1 1 e 1 1 1 which from 3 is simply a zero morphism d 0 1 1 h 1 s m 1 m e 0 therefore we obtain e 0 1 2 h 1 s m 1 m e and e 1 1 2 0 as a result we get h

again simply the zero morphism d 0 2 1 0 0 gives us e 0 2 2 0 and e 1 2 2 0 hence h 2 s m 0 4 2 4 at the level q 3 the short exact sequence 8 reduces to 0 h 3 s m e 0 3 2 0 and the differential d 0 3 1 e 0 3 1 e 1 3 1 is an epimorphism d 0 3 1 h 1 sm 2 m s 2 s 1 h 0 sm 0 m s 1 s 2 s 1 therefore e 1 3 2 0 and e 0 3 2 h 1 s m 2 m s 2 s 1 since e 1 3 2 0 and e 0 4 2 0 we realize that h q s m 0 for

eisenstein cohomology discussed in the next section the homological euler characteristic h of a group with coefficients in a representation v is defined by 16 h v i 0 1 i dimh i v for details on the above formula see 5 27 we recall the definition of orbifold euler characteristic if is torsion free then the orbifold euler characteristic is defined as orb h if has torsion elements and admits a finite index torsion free subgroup then the orbifold euler characteristic of is given by 17 orb 1 h one important fact is that following minkowski every arithmetic group of rank greater than one contains a torsion free finite index subgroup and therefore the concept of orbifold euler characteristic is well defined in this setting if has torion elements then we make use of the following formula discovered by wall in 29 18 h v t orb c t tr t 1 v otherwise we use the formula described in equation 16 the sum runs over all the conjugacy classes in of its torsion elements t denoted by t and c t denotes the centralizer of t in from now on orbifold euler characteristic orb will be simply denoted by orbifold euler characteristic has the following properties 1 if is finitely generated torsion free group then is defined as h q 2 if is finite of order then 1 3 let 1 and 2 be groups such that 1 1 2 1 is exact then 1 2 we now explain the use of the above properties by walking through the detailed computation of the euler characteristic of sl 2 z and gl 2 z with respect to their highest weight representations which we explain shortly we denote t 3 0 1 1 1 t 4 0 1 1 0 and t 6 0 1 1 1 then following 18 we know that when is gln z or sln z with n odd one has an expression of the form 19 h v a res fa c a tr a 1 v where fa denotes the characteristic polynomial of the matrix a now we will explain equation 19 in detail the summation is over all possible block diagonal matrices a satisfying the following conditions the blocks in the diagonal belong to the set 1 1 t 3 t 4 t 6 18 jitendra bajpai gu nter harder ivan horozov and matias moya giusti the blocks t 3 t 4 and t 6 appear at most once and 1 1 appear at most twice a change in the order of the blocks in the diagonal does not count as a different element so for example if n 10 the sum is empty and h v 0 in this case one can see that every a satisfying these properties has the same eigenvalues as a 1 even more every such a is conjugate over c to a 1 and therefore tr a 1 v tr a v we will use these facts in what follows for other groups the analogous formula of 18 is developed by chiswell in 6 let us explain briefly the notation res f let f 1 i x i and f 2 j x j be two polynomials then by the resultant of f 1 and f 2 we mean res f 1 f 2 i j i j if the characteristic polynomial f is a power of an irreducible polynomial then we define res f 1 let f f 1 f 2 fd where each fi is a power of an irreducible polynomial over q and they are relatively prime pairwise then we define res f i j res fi fj 5 1 example euler characteristic of sl 2 z and gl 2 z consider the group 0 sl 2 z i 2 for any subgroup sl 2 z containing i 2 we will denote by its corresponding subgroup in 0 i e i 2 consider the principal congruence subgroup 2 it is of index 6 and torsion free more precisely 2 h is topologically p 1 0 1 therefore 2 p 1 0 1 p 1 3 2 3 1 using this we immediately get 2 2 i 2 1 1 2 1 2 considering the following short exact sequence 1 2 sl 2 z sl 2 z 2 z 1 we obtain sl 2 z 1 12 and 0 1 6 similarly the exact sequence 1 sl 2 z gl 2 z det i 2 1 where det gl 2 z i 2 is simply the determinant map gives gl 2 z 1 24 for any torsion free arithmetic subgroup sln r we have the gauss bonnet formula h x x gb where gb is the gauss bonnet chern differential form and x sln r so n r see 10 this differential form is zero if n 2 and therefore for any torsion free congruence subgroup sln z h x 0 in particular by the definition of orbifold euler characteristic given by 17 this implies that sl 3 z 0 we will make use of this fact in the calculation of the homological euler characteristic of sl 3 z in the preceding analysis all the have been computed with respect to the trivial coefficient system in case of nontrivial coefficient system the whole game of computing becomes slightly delicate and interesting to deliver the taste of its complication we quickly motivate the reader by reviewing the computations of sl 2 z vm and gl 2 z vm 1 m 2 where vm and vm 1 m 2 are the highest weight irreducible representations of sl 2 and gl 2 respectively for notational convenience we will always denote the standard representation of sln z and gln z by v in boundary and eisenstein cohomology 19 case of sl 2 and gl 2 all the highest weight representations are of the form vm sym mv and vm 1 m 2 sym m 1 v detm 2 respectively here symmv denotes the mth symmetric power of the standard representation v let n be the n th cyclotomic polynomial then we list all the characteristic polynomials of torsion elements in sl 2 z and gl 2 z in the following table s no polynomial expanded form in sl 2 z s no polynomial expanded form in sl 2 z 1 2 1 x 1 2 yes 2 1 2 x 1 x 1 no 3 2 2 x 1 2

highest weight representations vm and vm 1 m 2 for sl 2 and gl 2 respectively for any torsion element t sl 2 z we define hm t tr t 1 vm tr t 1 symmv a b m a 1 b 2 where 1 and 2 are the two eigenvalues of t from now on we simply denote the representative of n torsion element t by its characteristic polynomial n therefore case t n c t c t hm t a i 2 2 1 sl 2 z 1 12 m 1 b i 2 2 2 sl 2 z 1 12 1 m m 1 c

12 and m 2 modulo 2 all these values are encoded in the second and third column of the table 5 below note that in what follows vm will denote vm 0 when it is considered as a representation of gl 2 it is well known that 22 sm 2 h 1 cusp gl 2 z vm c h 1 gl 2 z vm c h 1 gl 2 z vm c one can show that in fact these inclusions are isomorphisms because h 1 gl 2 z c 0 and for m 0 we have h 0 gl 2 z vm h 2 gl 2 z vm 0 and therefore dimh 1 gl 2 z vm h gl 2 z vm dimsm 2 hence we may conclude that for all m h 1 cusp gl 2 z vm c h 1 gl 2 z vm c h 1 gl 2 z vm c remark 4 note that if we do not want to get

next step we will explain the reader about the use of the notation m for convenience and to make the role of the coefficients m 1 m 2 in case of sl 3 z and m 1 m 2 m 3 in case of gl 3 z as clear as possible in the highest weight we will often use these coefficients in the subscript of the notation m in place of i e we write m mm 1 m 2 for sl 3 mm 1 m 2 m 3 for gl 3 for any torsion element t sl 3

highest weight representation mm 0 of sl 3 we also use the notation hm 1 m 2 tr t 1 mm 1 m 2 and hm 1 m 2 m 3 tr t 1 mm 1 m 2 m 3 where t is a torsion element with characteristic polynomial therefore

representations we compute the h sl 3 z mm 1 m 2 in the following table by computing each factor of the above equation 23 up to modulo 12 which is achieved simply by following the discussion of previous subsection 5 2 and more explicitly from lemma 9 and lemma 10 all these values are encoded in the following table consisting of 144 entries where rows run from 0 i 11 representingm 1 i mod 12 and columns runs through 0 j 11 representing m 2 j mod 12 to accommodate the data with the available space the table has been divided into two different tables of order 12 6 each in the first table table 8 j runs from 0 mod 12 to 5 mod 12 and in the second table table 9 from 6 mod 12 to 11 mod 12 and in both tables i runs from 0 mod 12 to 11 mod 12 once the entries of the table are computed we get complete information about the euler charac teristics of sl 3 z which is summarized in the following theorem 11 the euler characteristics of sl 3 z with coefficient in any highest weight represen tation mm 1 m 2 can be described by one of the following four cases depending on the parity of m 1 and m 2 more precisely 24 h sl 3 z mm 1 m 2 1 dimsm 1 2 dimsm 2 2 m 1 m 2 both even dimsm 1 2 dimsm 1 m 2 3 m 1 even m 2 odd dimsm 2 2 dimsm 1 m 2 3 m 1 odd m 2 even 0 m 1 m 2 both odd where sm 2 as described earlier in section 5 1 by equation 22 is the space of holomorphic cusp forms of weight m 2 for sl 2 z and for m 0 we define dims 2 1 for the reader s convenience the dimension of the space of cusp forms sm 2 is given by dims 12 2 i 1 if i 0 if i 2 4 6 8 1 if i 10 0 if i is odd 5 4 euler characteristic of gl 3 z with respect to the highest weight representations this subsection is merely an example to reveal the fact that the results obtained for sl 3 z can easily be extended to gl 3

eisenstein cohomology in this section by using the information obtained about boundary cohomology and euler char acteristic of sl 3 z we discuss the eisenstein cohomology with coefficients in m we define the eisenstein cohomology as the image of the restriction morphism to the boundary cohomology 25 r h s m h s m in general one can find the definition of eisenstein cohomology as a certain subspace of h s m that is a complement of a subspace of the interior cohomology it is known that the interior cohomology h s m is the kernel of the restriction morphism r more precisely we can simply consider the following happy scenario where the following sequence is exact 0 h s m h s m r h eis s m 0 to manifest the importance of the ongoing work and the complications involved we refer the interested reader to an important article 22 of lee and schwermer 6 1 a summary of boundary cohomology for further exploration we summarize the discus sion of boundary cohomology of sl 3 z carried out in section 4 in the form of following theorem theorem 12 for m 1 1 m 2 1 2 the boundary cohomology of the orbifold s of the arithmetic group sl 3 z with coefficients in the highest weight representation m is described as follows 1 case 1 m 1 m 2 0 then hq s m q for q 0 4 0 otherwise boundary and eisenstein cohomology 31 2 case 2 m 1 0 and m 2 6 0 m 2 even hq s m h 1 s m 1 m e q 1 h 1 s

hq s m 0 q observe that at this point we have explicit formulas to determine the cohomology of the boundary 6 2 poincare duality let m denote the dual representation of m m is in fact the irre ducible representation m associated to the highest weight w 0 where w 0 denotes the longest element in the weyl group one has the natural pairings see 16 h s m h 5 c s m q and h s m h 4 s m q these pairings are compatible with the restriction morphism r h s m h s m and the connecting homomorphism h s m h 1 c s m of the long exact sequence in cohomology associated to the pair s s in the sense that the pairings are compatible with the diagram h s m r h 5 c s m oo q h s m h 4 s m q h eis s m is the image of the restriction morphism r and therefore as an implication of the aforementionned compatibility between the pairings the spaces h eis s m are maximal isotropic subspaces of the boundary cohomology under the poincare duality this means that h eis s m is the orthogonal space of h eis s m under this duality 34 jitendra bajpai gu nter harder ivan horozov and matias moya giusti in particular one has 26 dimh eis s m dimh eis s m 1 2 dimh s m dimh s m 6 3 euler characteristic for boundary and eisenstein cohomology in the next few lines we establish a relation between the homological euler characteristics of the arithmetic group and the euler characteristic of the eisenstein cohomology of the arithmetic group and similarly another relation with the euler characteristic of the cohomology of the boundary during this section we will be frequently using the notations h eis sl 3 z m for h eis s m and h sl 3 z m for h s m to make it very explicit the arithmetic group we are working with see section 5 for the definition of homological euler characteristic of sl 3 z note that we can define the naive euler characteristic of the underlying geometric object as the alternating sum of the dimension of its various cohomology spaces following this we define h eis sl 3 z m i 1 i dimh eis sl 3 z m and h s m i 1 i dimh s m the following two statements corollary 13 and lemma 14 are synthesized in theorem 15 which is needed for computing the eisenstein cohomology of sl 3 z see theorem 16 as a consequence of theorem 12 we obtain the following immediate corollary 13 h s m 2 1 dimsm 1 2 dimsm 2 2 m 1 m 2 both even 2 dimsm 1 m 2 3 dimsm 1 2 m 1 even m 2 odd 2 dimsm 1 m 2 3 dimsm 2 2 m 1 odd m 2 even 0 m 1 m 2 both odd where we are denoting dims 2 1 as discussed in the previous paragraph we now state and prove a simple relation between euler characteristic of the eisenstein cohomology and the homological euler characteristic lemma 14 h eis sl 3 z m h sl 3 z m proof let us denote by hi hieis and h i the dimension of the spacesh i sl 3 z m h i eis sl 3 z m and h i sl 3 z m respectively by definition we have h sl 3 z m 3 i 0 1 ihi assume 6 0 then h 0 0 following bass milnor serre corollary 16 4 in 2 we know that h 1 0 boundary and eisenstein cohomology 35 on the other hand let m be the dual representation of m in our case if m 1 m 2 1 m 2 2 then m 1 m 2 1 m 1 2 one has by poincare duality that h q sl 3 z m is dual to h 5 q sl 3 z m moreover if 6 then h sl 3 z m 0 see for example lemma 3 2 of 15 therefore one has in all the cases h 2 h 3 using that we obtain h sl 3 z m h 2 h 3 h 2 eis h 2 h 3 eis h 3 h 2 eis h 3 eis h eis sl 3 z m we now state the following key result theorem 15 h eis sl 3 z m 1 2 h s m proof using corollary 13 and tables 8 and 9 we find that h s m 2 h sl 3 z m using lemma 14 we have 2 h sl 3 z m 2 h eis sl 3 z m therefore h s m 2 h eis sl 3 z m 6 4 main theorem on eisenstein cohomology for sl 3 z the following is the main result of the paper that gives both the dimension of the eisenstein cohomology together with its sources the corresponding parabolic subgroups it is stated using different cases that cover all possible highest weight representations a central part of the proof is based on theorem 12 and theorem 15 theorem 16 1 case 1 m 1 m 2 0 then h q eis sl 3 z m q for q 0 0 otherwise 2 case 2 m 1 0 and m 2 6 0 m 2 even h q eis sl 3 z m sm 2 2 q 3 0 otherwise 3 case 3 m 1 6 0 m 1 even and m 2 0 h q eis sl

5 case 5 m 1 6 0 m 1 even and m 2 odd then h q eis sl 3 z m sm 1 m 2 3 q 2 sm 1 2 q 3 0 otherwise 6 case 6 m 1 0 and m 2 odd then h q eis sl 3 z m sm 2 3 q q 2 0 otherwise 7 case 7 m 1 odd and m 2 0 h q eis sl 3 z m sm 1 3 q q 2 0 otherwise 8 case 8 m 1 odd and m 2 6 0 m 2 even then h q eis sl 3 z m sm 1 m 2 3 q 2 sm 2 2 q 3 0 otherwise 9 case 9 m 1 odd and m 2 odd then h q eis sl 3 z m 0 q proof let hi dimh i sl 3 z m hi dimh i sl 3 z m and hieis h i eis m dimh i eis sl 3 z m hi h i m dimh i s m boundary and eisenstein cohomology 37 for any nontrivial highest weight representation we have h 0 0 since any proper sl 3 z invariant subrepresentation of m is trivial also h 1 0 from bass milnor serre 2 corollary 16 4 there fore h 0 eis h 1 eis 0 following 28 and 4 we know that the cohomological dimension of sl 3 z is 3 moreover h 2 h 3 since the corresponding cohomology groups are dual to each other therefore 27 h sl 3 z m h 2 h 3 h 2 eis h 3 eis cases 2 3 and 4 we have that h 2 0 therefore h 2 eis 0 from equation 27 and theorem 15 we obtain h 3 eis h sl 3 z m 1 2 h s m using theorem 11 we conclude the formulas for case 2 and case 3 of theorem 15 cases 6 and 7 we have that h 3 0 therefore h 3 eis 0 from equation 27 and theorem 15 we obtain h 2 eis h sl 3 z m 1 2 h s m using theorem 12 we conclude the formulas for case 6 and case 7 of theorem 16 cases 5 and 8 the two cases are dual to each other thus it is enough to consider only case 5 from poincare duality 26 we have 28 i hieis m h i eis m 1 2 i hi m h i m from theorem 15 we have 29 i 1 i hieis m h i eis m 1 2 i 1 i hi m h i m adding equations 28 and 29 we obtain h 2 eis m h 2 eis m 1 2 h 2 m h 2 m subtracting equations 28 and 29 we obtain 30 h 3 eis m h 3 eis m 1 2 h 3 m h 3 m 1 2 h 1 m h 1 m also m is a regular representation therefore h 3 eis sl 3 z m h 3 s m sm 1 2 and h 3 eis sl 3 z m h 3 s m sm 2 2 form equation 30 we have h 3 eis m h 3 eis m dimsm 1 2 dimsm 2 2 therefore the above inclusions are equalities i e h 3 eis sl 3 z m sm 1 2 h 3 eis sl 3 z m sm 2 2 then 31 h 2 eis m h sl 3 z m h 3 eis m dimsm 1 m 2 3 since h 2 eis sl 3 z m h 2 s m therefore from theorem 12 and equation 31 we con clude that h 2 eis sl 3 z m sm 1 m 2 3 38 jitendra bajpai gu nter harder ivan horozov and matias moya giusti note that in case of gl 3 z its highest weight representation m is defined for highest weight m 1 1 m 2 2 m 3 3 with 1 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 in this case the cohomology groups hq gl 3 z m can be described explicitly which we state in the following lemma lemma 17 let m be the highest weight representation of gl 3 z with m 1 1 m 2 2 m 3 3 then hq gl 3 z m 0 m 1 2 m 2 3 m 3 1 mod 2 h 0 gm z h q sl 3 z m h q sl 3 z m m 1 2 m 2 3 m 3 0 mod 2 where m m sl 3 i e is the highest weight of sl 3 given by m 1 m 2 1 m 2 2 note that the first equality is by hochschild serre spectral sequence and the second one follows from the parity condition here gm z 1 1 we may conclude the above discussion simply in the following corollary corollary 18 let be either gl 3 z or sl 3 z and m be any highest weight representation of the following are true 1 if m is not self dual then hq m h q eis m 2 if m is self dual then we have hq m h q eis m h q m where h 2 m and h 3 m are dual to each other and h 0 m h 1 m 0 remark 19 in theorem 16 and hence in corollary 18 we obtain exactly the dimensions of the group cohomlogy h i gl 3 z m and h i sl 3 z m when the highest weight representation m is not self dual for self dual representations the result gives lower bounds for the dimensions because the discrepancy between the total cohomology and the eisenstein cohomology is the inner cohomology which over c contains the cuspidal cohomology that is nonzero only in degrees 2 and 3 even more because of poincare duality the inner cohomology in degree 2 is dual to the inner cohomology in degree 3 7 ghost classes following the discussion in section 2 we have hqc s m h q s m rq hq s m and the covering s p pq g p which induces a spectral sequence in cohomology connecting to h s m leads to another long exact sequence in cohomology 32 hq s m pq hq 1 m h q 2 m h q 0 m we now define the space of q ghost classes by ghq m im r q ker pq boundary and eisenstein cohomology 39 we will see that for almost every q and ghq m 0 for pedagogical reasons we now provide the details for all the nine cases to begin with let us define the maps s q hq 1 0 m h q s m and for i 1 2 r q i h q i m h q 0 m note that hq s m 0 for q 1 and q 4 following this in all the cases we obtain im r q 0 for q 1 and q 4 also in every case ker p 0 im s 0 0 therefore it is easy to see that in all the cases we get the following conclusion lemma 20 for any highest weight ghq m 0 for q 0 1 and q 4 now what remains to discuss is the space ghq m for q 2 3 following the above discussion we observe that in case 1 and case 9 ghq m 0 q since from theorem 12 h q s m 0 q in case 9 and for q 1 2 3 in case 1 note that case 2 and case 3 are dual to each other we know that h 2 s m 0 therefore ker p 2 0 this gives us gh 2 m 0 for q 3 we have gh 3 m im r 3 im s 3 where s 3 h 2 0 m h 3 s m and following 14 we see that im s 3 0 since h 2 0 m 0 in other words in case 2 there are no second degree cohomology classes of p 0 and this implies that the domain of s 3 is zero hence the image is so we conclude this in the form of following lemma lemma 21 in case 2 and case 3 i e for m 2 2 and m 1 1 respectively with m 1 m 2 non zero even integers ghq m 0 q let us discuss now the case 6 and case 7 following theorem 12 h 3 s m 0 and therefore gh 3 m 0 by the definition of ghost classes we have gh 2 m im r 2 im s 2 where s 2 h 1 0 m h 2 s m i e s 2 h 0 sm 0 m s 1 h 0 sm 0 m s 2 h 1 s m 1 m s 1 h 1 s m 2 m s 2 q q however h 0 sm 0 m s 2 0 and dimh 0 sm 0 m s 1 1 therefore in case 6 and case 7 either dimgh 2 m 0 or 1 lemma 22 in case 6 and case 7 i e for m 2 2 and m 1 1 respectively with m 1 and m 2 any odd integer ghq m 0 q except possibly for q 2 consider now the case 5 and case 8 in case 5 gh 2 m 0 since ker p 2 0 this simply follows by studying im s 2 where s 2 is defined by s 2 h 0 sm 0 m s 1 h 1 s m 1 m s 1 h 1 s m 2 m s 2 and ker s 2 is the image of the morphism h 1 1 m h 1 2 m h 1 0 m 40 jitendra bajpai gu nter harder ivan horozov and matias moya giusti from the exact sequence 32 from the calculations in section 4 we get im s 2 0 similarly we have s 3 h 0 sm 0 m s 1 s 2 h 0 sm 0 m s 2 s 1 h 1 s m 1 m s 1 s 2 sm 2 2 and again by same reasoning we see that s 3 vanishes therefore gh 3 m 0 case 8 is analogous and we simply conclude the following lemma 23 in case 5 and case 8 i e for m 1 1 m 2 2 with m 1 and m 2 nonzero and having different parity modulo 2 ghq m 0 q the only case that remains to discuss is case 4 following lemma 20 the only cases which need to be discussed are q 2 and q 3 however following case 4 of theorem 12 we know that h 2 s m 0 therefore gh 2 m 0 gh 3 m 0 because h 2 0 m 0 hence we can simply summarize this in the form of following lemma lemma 24 in case 4 i e for m 1 1 m 2 2 with m 1 m 2 both non zero even integers ghq m 0 q remark 25 we can summarize the whole discussion of this section in the following lines to give the reader an intuitive idea of how to get to the punchline the kernel of pq is isomorphic to the image of s q and the image of rq is the eisenstein cohomology of degree q thus the ghost classes are classes in the eisenstein cohomology that are also in the image of the connecting homomor phism sq since the eisenstein cohomology is concentrated in degrees 2 and 3 see theorem 16 we have that any ghost class of sl 3 z must come from the image of h 1 0 m or h 2 0 m in h 2 s m or h 3 s m respectively examining all the nine cases of boundary cohomology see theorem 12 we see that there is no contribution from the minimal parabolic subgroup p 0 to the boundary cohomology of degree 2 or 3 except in the cases 6 and 7 thus there are no ghost classes in sl 3 z and similarly in gl 3 z except possibly in the cases 6 and 7 hence we summarize the discussion in the following theorem theorem 26 there are no nontrivial ghost classes in sl 3 z and gl 3 z except in the cases 6 and 7 in those cases non zero ghost classes might occur only in degree 2 where we have gh 2 m 0 or q acknowledgement the authors would like to thank the max
