each s s the vector spaces h xs fs carry the perverse leray filtrations p fs associated with the morphism fs xs ys it is natural to ask how these filtered vector spaces h xs fs p fs behave as s varies in s the main goal of this paper is to provide criteria theorem 3 2 1 for checking local constancy of these filtrations 1 http arxiv org abs 1808 02235 v 1 2 mark andrea a de cataldo davesh maulik 1 1 perverse filtration for the hitchin morphism our motivating example arises from perverse filtrations associated to the hitchin mor phism for the moduli space of higgs bundles for a smooth projective variety we refer to 4 1 for more details on what follows let x s be a smooth projective morphism with connected fibers over a connected quasi projective variety and let g be a reductive group associated to this family is the so called dolbeault moduli space d d x s g md x s g s and the hitchin projective s morphism h h x s g md x s g v x s g which induces for every point s s the hitchin morphism hs h xs g md xs g v xs g it follows from non abelian hodge theory that the the structural morphism d is topologically locally trivial over s it follows that the intersection cohomology groups ih md xs g q on the dolbeault moduli spaces md xs g give rise to local sys tems ih d x s g on s for every s s the hitchin morphism hs induces the perverse leray filtration p hs d xs g on the intersection cohomology groups ih md xs g q it does not seem immediately clear that these perverse leray filtrations should match up and give rise to locally constant subsheaves of the local systems ih d x s g on s a priori the perverse filtrations could jump at special point in s for example a priori one could have un expected direct summands in d v xs g in the decomposition theorem for the hitchin morphism h xs g at special points s s for a brief discussion see the beginning of 3 in this paper we prove the following result which can be viewed as some evidence towards the validity of the p w question and conjecture see question 4 1 7 and remark 4 1 8 the weight filtration on the intersection cohomology of the betti moduli spaces of a family of projective manifolds gives rise to locally constant sheaves on the base of the family if p w then the same would be true for the corresponding perverse leray filtrations associated with the family of hitchin morphisms and this is what the following theorem asserts theorem 1 1 1 the perverse leray filtration is locally constant the perverse leray filtration gives rise to locally constant subsheaves p hd x s g ih d x s g 1 theorem 1 1 1 follows at once from theorem 1 1 2 below to the effect that specialization is a filtered isomorphism for the perverse leray filtrations theorem 1 1 2 let s be a nonsingular connected curve let s s be any point let be a suitably general disk centered at s and let t s be a suitably general point the specialization morphism ih md xs g q ih md xt g q is well defined and gives a filtered isomorphism for the respective perverse leray filtrations p hsd xs g and p htd xt g in particular the dimensions of the graded spaces gr p hs d ih md xs g q are independent of s s remark 1 1 3 theorems 1 1 1 and 1 1 2 hold with the same proof if we replace the dolbeault moduli spaces with their twisted counterparts cf remark 4 1 8 in the cases of the perverse filtration for the hitchin fibration is locally constant 3 relative dimension dimx s 1 and g gln sln pgln in these cases the dolbeault moduli spaces are integral orbifolds even nonsingular in the cases g gln sln we may say informally that the perverse leray filtration for the hitchin morphism associated with a family of projective manifolds is independent of the members of the family in particular by applying this to curves and their moduli space we may say that the perverse leray filtration on the intersection cohomology of the dolbeault moduli space associated with the curve and the reductive group g is independent of the curve theorem 1 1 2 concerning the hitchin morphism is proved in 4 2 as a corollary to the more general theorem 3 2 1 which provides a sufficient condition for when the specializa tion morphism is well defined and is a filtered isomorphism 1 2 motivation from gopakumar vafa invariants one motivation for this work is to help understand a conjecture on gopakumar vafa invariants proposed in mt following earlier work of kiem li kl in this section we briefly sketch this connection let x denote a calabi yau threefold and let h 2 x z denote a curve class on x there are various approaches to defining virtual counts of curves on x in class gromov witten or pandharipande thomas invariants for example while these typically produce an infinite series of invariants a physics proposal of gopakumar vafa suggests that they should be governed by finitely many integers determined from the cohomology of a space of one dimensional sheaves in mt the authors suggest a rigorous approach to their proposal using the perverse filtration as follows consider the moduli space m x of stable one dimensional sheaves on x with support cycle class and euler characteristic 1 and let m x chow x denote the hilbert chow morphism to the chow variety ofx which remembers the support cycle 1 under certain assumptions m x carries a natural perverse sheaf m associated to its shifted symplectic structure and one can study the perverse cohomology sheaves of its pushforward more precisely in mt the authors define gopakumar vafa invariants ng of x in class via the identity i z phi r m y i g 0 ng y 1 2 y 1 2 2 g 2 conjecturally these gv invariants should after a universal change of variables agree with the gromov witten invariants of x in class since the precise relationship is somewhat intricate we refer the reader there for details in order for this picture to be plausible it is necessary for gv invariants to be invariant under deformations of the calabi yau threefold x indeed such deformation invariance is built into the intersection theoretic constructions of gw pt invariants one can view the main theorem of this paper as evidence for this invariance for example one consequence of our main result is the deformation invariance of ng for local del pezzo surfaces while 1 one needs to pass to seminormalizations to define this 4 mark andrea a de cataldo davesh maulik there is no discussion of the sheaf m in this paper one might hope to extend the technique here to this more general setting 1 3 outline 2 sets up the notation more precisely 2 1 sets up the notation in the context of the constructible derived category 2 2 is concerned with the formalism of the vanish ing nearby cycles functors and of the specialization morphism 3 deals with the perverse leray filtration and specialization 3 1 contains proposition 3 1 4 which provides a sufficient condition for when perverse truncation and shifted restriction to a cartier divisor commute 3 2 contains our main technical result the aforementioned theorem 3 2 1 4 contains our main application to the hitchin morphism 4 1 is a refresher on dol beault and betti moduli spaces and also proves some preliminary facts needed in the proof given in 4 2 of theorem 1 1 2 which in turn implies theorem 1 1 1 on the local constancy of the perverse leray filtration for the hitchin morphism over a base 1 4

1 general notation by variety we mean a separated scheme of finite type over the field of complex numbers c by point we mean a closed point see d m 2009 for a quick introduction and for standard references for many of the concepts and objects in this subsection given a variety y we denote by d y the constructible bounded derived category of sheaves of rational vector spaces on y endowed with the middle perversity t structure we denote derived functors using the un derived notation e g if f x y is a morphism of varieties then the derived direct image push forward functor rf is denoted by f etc distinguished triangles in d y are denoted g g g the full subcategory of perverse sheaves is denoted by p y we employ the following standard notation for the objects associated with this t structure the full subcategories pd j y and pd j y j z of d y and pd j k y pd j y pd k y j k z the truncation functors p j d y pd j y and p j d y pd j y the perverse cohomology functors phj d y p y at times we drop the space variable y from the notation the following operations preserve constructibility of complexes ordinary and extraor dinary push forward and pull backs hom and tensor product verdier duality the nearby and vanishing cycle functors also preserves constructibility with the provision that when dealing with these functors one is working over a disk the perverse filtration for the hitchin fibration is locally constant 5 the k th hyper cohomology groups of y with coefficients in g d y are denoted by hk y g the complex computing this cohomology is denoted by r y g and it lives in the bounded derived category d point whose objects are complexes of vector spaces with cohomology given by finite dimensional rational vector spaces the filtrations we consider are finite and increasing for everyg d y the t structure defines a natural filtered object r y g p and p is called the perverse filtration if a statement is valid for every value of an index e g the degree of a cohomology group or the step of a filtration then we denote such an index by a bullet point symbol or by a star symbol h x f p p p h x f gr pf h x f given g d y we have the system of truncation morphisms p k 1 g p kg g 3 a morphism g g in d y gives rise to a system of morphisms p g p g 4 which are compatible with 3 is the evident manner we say that the system 4 is a system of compatible morphisms it gives rise to a morphisms of filtered objects r y g p r y g p in df pt 5 where df denotes the filtered derived category il 1971 recall that p y is artinian so that the jordan holder theorem holds in it the constituents of a non zero perverse sheaf g p y are the isomorphisms classes of the perverse sheaves appearing in the unique and finite collection of non zero simple perverse sheaves appearing as the quotients in a jordan holder filtration of g the constituents of a non zero complex g d y are defined to be the constituents of all of its non zero perverse cohomology sheaves in general we drop decorations indices parentheses space variables etc if it seems harmless in the context in the context of a cartesian diagram of varieties we denote parallel arrows by the same symbol this should not lead to confusion in expressions like the base change morphism g f f g we are going to make heavy use of the nearby vanishing cycle functors see 2 2 for the basic facts we are going to use the decomposition theorem for semisimple complexes i e isomor phic to direct sums of shifted simple perverse sheaves due to mochizuki sabbah and others see the references in de 2017 theorem 2 1 1 let f x y be a proper morphism of varieties and let f d x be semisimple then f f is semisimple 2 2 the vanishing and nearby cycles formalism standard references for this section are de 1972 xiii xiv and ka sh 1990 ch 8 10 6 mark andrea a de cataldo davesh maulik let s be a nonsingular and connected curve and consider a morphism of varieties v vy y s let s s and let i s s be the closed embedding this is what we call the special point objects restricted to s maybe be denoted with a subscript s e g ys v 1 s in what follows in choice 2 2 9 we choose a disk s centered at s for the relevance of this choice to this paper see remark 2 2 14 let y v 1 y and let vy vy y y we have the functors i i y and y i i d y d ys 6 where is the nearby cycle functor and is the vanishing cycle functor we have the two verdier dual canonical distinguished triangle of functors we denote by the same symbol the dual arrows i 1 1 o o o 1 i 1 o o o 7 recall that p p ditto for p and ph 8 fact 2 2 1 t exactness for 1 and the functors 1 and are exact func tors of triangulated categories are t exact and they commute with verdier duality in particular they commute with the formation of the perverse cohomology sheaves functors ph and with the perverse truncation functors p and p we thus have the following canonical identifications p p p 1 1 p ditto for p and ph 9 the following is a key property of the vanishing cycle functor fact 2 2 2 vanishing of for smooth morphism and lisse sheaves if vy y is smooth and g d y has locally constant cohomology sheaves on y then g 0 d ys see de 1972 xiii 2 1 5 note the special case where y s and vy is the identity fact 2 2 3 the composition i 1 1 i 1 yields a morphism of functors d y d ys i 1 i 1 10 the morphism 10 is an isomorphism when evaluated on a complex g d y such that g 0 in this case we have isomorphisms i 1 g 1 g i 1 g 11 the morphism 10 coincides with the morphism obtained via verdier s specialization functor cf sc 2003 for example so that it depends only on the closed embedding ys y i e it is independent of vy and of the choice of the disk the perverse filtration for the hitchin fibration is locally constant 7 fact 2 2 4 base change diagrams for and let f x y be an s morphism and let vx vy f x s the base change morphisms associated with i and f give rise to morphisms of distinguished triangles of morphisms as follows cf de 1972 xiii 2 1 7 1 i 1 f f y 1 f y f o o o f i 1 f f x 1 f x o o o 12 when f is proper the morphism 12 is an isomorphism 2 y f y 1 f f i 1 f o o o f x f y 1 f f i 1 o o o 13 when f is proper the morphism 13 is an isomorphism 3 by combining the 12 with 13 we obtain the following commutative diagram i 1 f 1 f i 1 f f i 1 f 1 f i 1 14 let t s be another point and by abuse of notation denote the closed embedding t s also by t there is the natural morphism cf 10 t 1 t 1 15 fact 2 2 5 let g d y and let t s be a general point then the natural morphism t 1 g t 1 g is an isomorphism in d yt to see this recall 10 and use the van ishing of vanishing cycle functor translated to t sc 2003 rmk 4 2 4 as usual here general means that it can be chosen to be any point of a suitable zariski dense open subset so s that depends on g d y the following follows from the fact that for t general t 1 t 1 commute with all the functors involved in the constructions of perverse truncation fact 2 2 6 t exactness and t t let g d y and let t s be general then we have t 1 p g p t 1 g t 1 p g p t 1 g ditto for p and ph 16 fact 2 2 7 what follows is a consequence of deligne s generic base change theorem de 1976 thm 9 1 and of stratification theory see also the discussion in d m 2009 b given a finite collection of morphisms vi yi s and complexes gi d yi there is a zariski dense open subset so s such that the direct images vi gi are lisse and such that 8 mark andrea a de cataldo davesh maulik their formation commutes with arbitrary base change by shrinking so if necessary we can further assume that the gi have no constituent supported on fibers of the morphisms vi over s o and that the strata on the yi of stratifications with respect to which the gi are constructible map smoothly to s over so cf sc 2003 rmk 4 2 4 the points t so are said to be general for the finite collection gi definition 2 2 8 we say that t s is general for the collection of gi s if t s o so g cf fact 2 2 7 choice 2 2 9 let s s let so s be the zariski dense open subset of points of the connected curve s which are general with respect to some finite collection of gi s as above let t so choose a disk s t s such that s so chose a pointed universal covering t t remark 2 2 10 in the special case where vy y s is the identity on s we have that i i d s d s and that t t d s d t we have canonical identifications d s d pt d t where pt is just a point so that all three categories are naturally equivalent to the bounded derived category of finite dimensional rational vector spaces similarly in the filtered case df s df pt df t when vy y s is the identity we have the following fact 2 2 11 fundamental isomorphism let things be as in choice 2 2 9 there are the natural isomorphisms t 1 g 1 g t 1 g in d t d pt d s 17 where all three terms are well defined up to canonical isomorphism independently of the choices but where the isomorphisms which depend on the choice of t are uniquely defined modulo the monodromy action of the fundamental group 1 t see the fundamental identity de 1972 xiv 1 3 3 1 note that 17 is verdier self dual fact 2 2 12 specialization morphism consider in the special case where f is vy the morphism of distinguished triangles 12 we place ourselves in the set up of choice 2 2 9 one would like to specialize cohomology from the special point s to the general point t this is not always possible as we now discuss diagram 12 yields the functorial morphism of distinguished triangles in d pt r s i v g y r s v g r yt t g r s 1 v g o o o r ys i g sp 44 r ys y g r ys y 1 g o o o 18 where the canonical identification in the middle of the first row stems from fact 2 2 11 and the fact that base change is an isomorphism for general t cf fact 2 2 7 note that while this identification depends on the choice of the pre image t of t the resulting restriction morphism y r y g r yt g depends only on t and not on the choice t in fact monodromy acts on the target but the domain maps into the invariants the perverse filtration for the hitchin fibration is locally constant 9 let us emphasize an important piece of diagram 18 note that the middle term below does not change when we shrink the disk centered about s r ys i g r y g restriction to s oo restriction to t r yt t g 19 in general i e without any further hypothesis ensuring that the restriction to s is an isomorphism there is no resulting natural morphism r ys g r yt g when restriction to s is an isomorphism e g when vy is proper then we call the resulting morphism the specialization morphism r ys g sp r yt g 20 of course even if vy is not proper it may happen that there is a well defined specialization morphism for some g d y when the specialization morphism is well defined we have the distinguished triangle v i g i v g sp v g v g o o o 21 fact 2 2 13 if g d s has locally constant cohomology sheaves then a specialization morphism is an isomorphism this follows at once from fact 2 2 2 remark 2 2 14 the choice 2 2 9 is harmless for our purposes in fact when defined the specialization morphism depends only on s and on t so s note also that the morphisms 15 are independent of the choice of the disk 3 perverse filtration and specialization if one analyzes the behavior of the perverse filtration in families via the specialization morphism there are two issues first the specialization morphism is not defined in general if x is not proper over s which is the case for families of dolbeault moduli spaces the second issue is that even when the specialization morphism is defined as it is in the case of the dolbeault moduli spaces it gives rise to a filtered morphism for the perverse leray filtrations its failure to be a filtered isomorphism is detected by the filtered cone however in general this is not the filtered cone associated with the natural morphism of functors i i the pull back to the special fiber the nearby fiber functor this is due to the fact that perverse truncation does not commute with restriction pull back e g when one has a direct summand supported on the special fiber the goal of this section is to prove theorem 3 2 1 in 3 2 which is a criterion to have a well defined specialization morphism which is a filtered isomorphism for the corresponding perverse filtrations to this end in 3 1 we study a bit the relationship between perverse truncation and restriction to a cartier divisor 10 mark andrea a de cataldo davesh maulik 3 1 cartier divisors and partial t exactness the purpose of this section is to prove proposition 3 1 4 especially equation 30 we recommend that readers skip this section at a first reading the next lemma records some general t exactness properties related to embeddings of effective cartier divisors on varieties lemma 3 1 1 let t t be a closed embedding of varieties such that the open embedding t t t is an affine morphism e g t is an effective weil divisor supporting an effective cartier divisor then we omit the space variables 1 the functor is right t exact and the functor is left t exact i e pd pd pd pd 22 2 the functor 1 is left t exact and the functor 1 is right t exact pd pd 1 pd pd 1 23 proof the inequalities 22 are be be de 1982 4 2 4 in fact they are valid for any immersion what follows is specific to the situation of the lemma we prove the inequalities 23 recall that by be be de 1982 4 1 10 ii we have if g p t than g pd 1 0 the desired inequality for follows from this fact and a simple descending induction on by using of the truncation distinguished triangles ph p p 1 and ph 1 pd 1 0 since for g p t we have that g pd 0 1 the proof for is analogous alterna tively it can also be deduced from the one for by verdier duality the following lemma is a technical preliminary to proposition 3 1 4 lemma 3 1 2 canonical factorization of p 1 i p i let t t be as in lemma 3 1 1 the natural morphism p 1 p admits a canonical factorization p 1 p p 24 similarly for the dual natural morphism p 1 p oo p 1 p oo p oo 25 proof we start with the following diagram of distinguished triangles ind t the arrows and are not part of either distinguished triangle they are there to help visualize the situation p p 1 o o o p 1 66 p p 1 o o o 26 by the l h s of 23 we have that p 1 d t pd t 27 the perverse filtration for the hitchin fibration is locally constant 11 by be be de 1982 prop 1 1 9 p 23 the diagram 26 can then be completed uniquely to a morphism of distinguished triangles this is visualized by means of the dotted arrows the conclusion follows from the inequality 27 by taking the long exact sequence associated with homd t p 1 applied to the distinguished triangle on the top of 26 in fact for every g d y we have homd t p 1 g 0 when evaluated at something in pd t the proof for is analogous alternatively it can also be deduced from the one for by verdier duality remark 3 1 3 in view of the l h s inequality in 23 the r h s vertex in 26 satisfies the inequality p 1 d pd by taking the long exact sequence of perverse coho mology of the top distinguished triangle in 26 the aforementioned inequality yields the natural isomorphism of functors p 1 p p 1 28 proposition 3 1 4 no constituents on divisors and t exactness let t t be as in lemma 3 1 1 if g d t has no constituent supported on t then the morphisms cfr 24 are isomorphisms and we get natural isomorphisms p 1 g p g p 1 g p g ph 1 g 1 ph g 29 the same holds if we replace with and 1 with 1 equivalently we have p 1 g 1 p g p 1 g 1 p g oo ph 1 g 1 ph g oo 30 proof it is enough to prove 29 the statement for follows by verdier duality the equivalent statements are mere reformulations by means of 9 it is enough to prove the first statement on the l h s of 29 for the remaining ones follow formally by consideration of the truncation distinguished triangles we have that p g pd so that by 22 we have that p g pd and then clearly we have that p g p p g 31 in view of 31 and of 28 and by considering the truncation triangle p 1 p ph applied to p g in order to prove the first equality on the lhs in 29 it is necessary and sufficient to show that ph p g 0 this can be argued as follows by taking the long exact sequence of perverse cohomology of the distinguished triangle p 1 g p g ph g we see that it is necessary and sufficient to show that ph g pd 1 or equivalently that ph g pd 1 by be be de 1982 4 1 10 ii we have the distinguished triangle ph 1 ph g 1 ph g ph 0 ph g and an epimorphism ph g ph 0 ph g since g is as sumed to not have constituents supported at ys we must have ph 0 ph g 0 so 12 mark andrea a de cataldo davesh maulik that ph g pd 1 as requested the l h s equality in 29 follows and we are done we shall use the following simple lemma where we employ the notation in 2 2 lemma 3 1 5 let g d y be such that y g 0 then no constituent of g is supported on ys proof by chasing the definitions we see that we may assume that g is perverse by using the fact that is t exact and by an easy induction on the length of a jordan ho lder filtration of g we see that g 0 for every constituent g of g the conclusion follows from the fact that if g d y is a non zero complex supported on ys then i g g by combining lemma 3 1 5 with proposition 3 1 4 we obtain the following corollary 3 1 6 let g d y be such that y g 0 then we have a natural isomor phism p i 1 g i 1 p g similarly for p and for ph ditto for i 1 32 3 2 compatibility of the specialization morphism with the perverse filtration theorem 3 2 1 let f x y be proper morphism let vy y s be a morphisms onto a nonsingular connected curve and let f d x choose s t s and a disk as in choice 2 2 9 assume one of the following conditions i f 0 and vy is proper or ii f 0 and the v p f f have locally constant cohomology sheaves on s or iii f is semisimple f 0 and v f f has locally constant cohomology sheaves on s then the specialization morphism is well defined and it is a filtered isomorphism for the respective perverse leray filtrations sp r xs i f p fs r xt t f p ft 33 proof by applying 14 to the p f we obtain the following commutative diagrams i 1 v p f 1 3 1 v p f 4 2 i 1 v p f 5 v i 1 p f 1 sp 66 v 1 p f 2 v i 1 p f 34 up to shift the cones of 1 and 2 coincide with v p f the cones of 1 and 2 coincide with v p f let us prove i in this case we only need the commutative square on the l h s of 34 since v is assumed to be proper the base change morphisms 3 and 4 are isomorphisms in particular the specialization morphism sp is well defined and it gives rise to a system of compatible morphisms the perverse filtration for the hitchin fibration is locally constant 13 the assumption f 0 which is common to i and ii implies by the t exactness of and the properness of f that v p f f v p f f 0 i e that the cone of 1 is zero so that so is the cone of 1 it follows that i is a system of compatible isomorphisms and as such it gives rise to an isomorphism in the filtered derived category the filtered complex r xs i 1 f p fs arises in connection with the cohomology of the compatible system of complexes v p f i 1 f similarly the filtered complex r xt t 1 f p ft arises in connection with the cohomology of the compatible system of complexes v p f t 1 f it remains to identify a v i 1 p f f with v p f 1 i f and b 1 v p f f with v p f t 1 f to achieve b we argue as follows the choice of t general for f made in definition 2 2 8 allows us to replace with t cf 17 use the identification t v v t use the identification t 1 p p t 1 cf 16 use the identification t v v t then b follows to achieve a we argue as follows we first apply corollary 3 1 6 to g f f the condition f f 0 is met in view of the properness of f and of f 0 we then apply proper base change i f f i then a follows and i is proved let us prove ii as it has been seen above the assumption f 0 implies that the cones of 1 and 2 are zero so that 1 and 2 are isomorphisms since we are assuming that the v p f f have locally constant cohomology sheaves on we have that the cones of 1 and 2 are zero as well cf fact 2 2 2 so that 1 and 2 are isomorphisms since the morphism 5 is an isomorphism all the morphisms in 34 are isomorphisms we conclude as in case i case iii is weaker than case ii we can also prove it without resorting to the use of corollary 3 1 6 the proof is very similar except that in order to achieve the critical commutation property a via corollary 3 1 6 we use that f semisimple implies f f semisimple cf the decomposition theorem 2 1 1 the assumption f 0 implies that no simple summand of f f is supported on ys the commutation property for a simple un shifted simple perverse summand p which we know not to be supported on ys follows from be be de 1982 4 10 1 to the effect that i 1 p is perverse 4 the hitchin morphism and specialization 4 1 the betti and dolbeault moduli spaces the p w conjecture let x s be a smooth projective morphism over a variety s and let g be a reductive group 14 mark andrea a de cataldo davesh maulik the betti moduli space mb x s g cf si 1994 pp 12 15 is a complex analytic space over s the fiber over a point s s is the moduli space a k a the character variety mb xs g of representations of the fundamental group of xs into g the dolbeault moduli space md x s g cf si 1994 9 esp prop 9 7 is quasi projective over s in general it is not proper over s the fiber over a point s s is the moduli space md xs g of principal higgs bundles of semiharmonic type on xs for the group g fact 4 1 1 non abelian hodge theorem there is a natural s homeomorphism of the underlying topological spaces cf si 1994 thm 9 11 and lm 9 14 x s g mb x s g md x s g 35 to fix ideas in what follows we tacitly assume that s and the fibers of the family x s are connected such an assumption is for ease of exposition only see si 1994 pp 14 15 choose any point so s the structural morphism b x s g mb x s g s is analytically locally trivial over s with transition functions with values in the group of c scheme automorphisms of the fiber mb xso g see si 1994 lm 6 2 p 13 more precisely let s s o s so be a pointed universal covering space with associated identification of the deck transformation group with the fundamental group 1 s so the fundamental group acts onmso via c scheme automorphisms mb x s g is constructed as the quotient of mb xso g s under the usual action of the fundamental group 1 s so fact 4 1 2 local triviality of the dolbeault moduli space over the base the local triviality of the betti moduli space over the base coupled with the non abelian hodge theorem s homeomorphism 35 implies that the structural morphism d x s g md x s g s is topologically locally trivial over the base s recall that for irreducible varieties the intersection cohomology complexes groups are topological invariants independent of the stratification cf go ma 1983 4 1 note that go ma 1983 deals with irreducible analytic varieties on the other hand as the forthcoming lemma 4 1 3 shows if we define the intersection complex of a variety as the direct sum of the intersection complex of its irreducible components then the topological invariance of the intersection cohomology complexes groups is still valid in particular given a topologically locally trivial fibration with fibers varieties the intersection cohomology groups of the fibers give rise to locally constant sheaves on the base we thank g williamson for suggesting the definition of the set x in the proof of the following lemma our original set x was defined using the notion of local irreducibility and lead to a more cumbersome proof lemma 4 1 3 topological invariance of intersection cohomology for reducible varieties let x and y be complex analytic set and let g x y be a homeomorphism of the underlying topological spaces endowed with the classical topology then the perverse filtration for the hitchin fibration is locally constant 15 1 the homeomorphism g induces a natural bijection i b on the sets of irre ducible components of x and y such that g induces homeomorphisms xi y i for every i i 2 define the intersection complex icx of a complex analytic set x to be the direct product of the intersection cohomology complexes of the irreducible components of x then the homeomorphism u induces a natural isomorphism icx u icy proof the case whenx and y are irreducible is proved by m goresky and r macpherson in go ma 1983 it is thus clear that it is enough to prove the first statement of the lemma which is what we do next leaving some elementary details to the reader let x y resp the be open subset of those points of x y resp admitting a classical open neighborhood all of whose points admit a classical open neighborhood homeomorphic to a euclidean space of some dimension since x is defined topologically it is clear that g x y we have the following inclusions of classical open subsets xsm x xo x xsmi x i x o i xi where xsm is the set of smooth points of the complex analytic set x and xo is the complement of the union of all intersections xi xj i j i i 6 j and where i denotes intersection with the irreducible component xi the classical open subsets xsmi and x o i are also zariski open irreducible and connected the classical open subset x i is connected the x i are the connected components of x the homeomorphism g must respect the decomposition of x and y into their connected components so that we obtain the desired bijection i b the classical closure of x i is xi and since g is a homeomorphism we must have that g induces a homeomorphism xi y i lemma 4 1 3 implies at once the following corollary 4 1 4 let f s be a varieties let x be an s variety and let x f s be an s homeomorphism then for every s s we have canonical isomorphisms pr f icf xs icxs remark 4 1 5 the definition of intersection cohomology complex for reducible varieties stemming from lemma 4 1 3 is reasonable in view of the fact that it satisfies virtually all the usually properties of the usual intersection cohomology complex for irreducible varieties e g purity mixed and pure hodge structures artin vanishing lefschetz theorems relative hard lefschetz hodge riemann relations decomposition theorem see d 2012 4 6 for example the intersection cohomology groups of the fibers of b x s g give rise to locally constant sheaves ih b x s g on s in view of the homeomorphism x s g and of the topological invariance of intersection cohomology the same applies to the dolbeault picture and we get locally constant sheaves ih d x s g on s fact 4 1 6 the betti weight filtration is locally constant by the local triviality of b x s g over s and since the transition automorphisms are compatible with mixed 16 mark andrea a de cataldo davesh maulik hodge structures in intersection cohomology we see that the weight filtration w for the mixed hodge structure for the intersection cohomology of the fibers of b x s g gives rise to locally constant subsheaves w b x s g ih b x s g on s the dolbeault moduli space is endowed with a natural gm action cf si 1994 p 62 and p 17 given by scalar multiplication on the higgs field the reference in this paragraph is si 1994 p 20 23 which deals with the case of g gln suitably adapted to an arbitrary reductive g the dolbeault moduli space admits the hitchin s morphism h x s g md x s g v x s g 36 here v x s g is the quasi projective s variety representing the functor s s 7 rkgi 1 h 0 x s symei g 1 x s where the positive integers ei are the degrees of the gen erators of conjugation invariant polynomials on the lie algebra of g the hitchin mor phism assigns to a g principal higgs bundle the symmetric polynomials appearing as the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the higgs field viewed as sections of the appropriate sheaf the hitchin morphism is proper over s hence projective over s the dolbeault moduli space is quasi projective over s domain and target of the hitchin morphism are endowed with a natural gm action cf si 1994 p 62 which covers the trivial action on s the gm action on the target is contracting the hitchin morphism is gm equivariant we observe that the mixed hodge structure on the intersection cohomology groups of each dolbeault moduli space is pure the starting point is the gm equivariance and the contracting action then one can imitate the proof of de hai li 2017 lemma 6 1 1 and references therein and the proof of thm 2 4 1 we do not need this fact except to point out that it is in sharp contrast with the expected known in some cases non purity of the corresponding intersection cohomology groups of each betti moduli space question 4 1 7 is p w in the non abelian hodge theory in arbitrary dimen sions let x be a connected smooth projective variety then for the weight filtration wb x g do we have wb 2 1 x g w 2 x g ih mb x g via the non abelian hodge theorem isomorphism do we have that wb 2 x g p h d x g where p hd x g is the perverse leray filtration for the hitchin morphism suitably nor malized so that it starts at zero remark 4 1 8 actually the p w conjecture which is due to m a de cataldo t hausel and l migliorini is concerned with a twisted version of the betti dolbeault moduli spaces for curves of genus g 2 the paper de hau mi 2012 proves the validity of the conjecture in this twisted case when x is a curve and g gl 2 sl 2 and pgl 2 in this twisted case over a curve of genus g 2 the moduli spaces for g gln sln are nonsingular and for g pgln they are orbifolds theorem 1 1 2 applies to this situation in the next section we prove theorem 1 1 2 to the effect that the perverse filtration gives rise to locally constant subsheaves subsheaves p hd x s g ih x s g on s we need the following the perverse filtration for the hitchin fibration is locally constant 17 lemma 4 1 9 let things be as in theorem 1 1 2 let f be the intersection complex of the dolbeault moduli space md x s g then f 0 37 the specialization morphism is defined and it is an isomorphism sp r xs i f r xt t f 38 proof the betti moduli space is topologically locally trivial over any disk contained in s by the non abelian hodge theorem the dolbeault moduli space is also topologically locally trivial over our disk let md xs g md x g be any topological trivialization then the intersection complex on md x g is the pull back of the intersection complex of md xs g via the first projection associated with the chosen trivialization both the conclusions of the lemma follow 4 2 proof of theorem 1 1 2 on the hitchin morphism and specialization proof we denote the hitchin morphism 36 simply by h m v we denote the structural s morphisms by m s and v s let icm be the intersection complex of the dolbeault moduli space m our first goal is to verify that we are now in the situation of theorem 3 2 1 ii we set x y s f v f to be m v s h icm the requirement f 0 is met by lemma 4 1 9 as in the proof of lemma 4 1 9 the intersection complex icm is locally over the nonsingular s the pull back from of the intersection complex of a fiber it follows that the direct image sheaves r icm ih d x s g are locally constant on s with stalks the intersection cohomology groups of the fibers of m s by the decomposition theorem be be de 1982 applied to the projective h and the simple perverse sheaf icm we have that the truncated p h icm are direct summands of the direct image h f it follows that p h icm are direct summands of icm h icm in d s by combining the two last paragraphs we have that the p h icm have locally constant cohomology sheaves we can thus apply theorem 3 2 1 ii or its weaker variant iii the conclusion of which is that the specialization morphism r ms i icm r mt t icm is defined and it is a filtered isomorphism for the respective perverse leray filtrations since as it has been observed above the intersection complex of m restricts to the intersection complexes of the fibersms andmt the first assertion of theorem 1 1 2 follows the second assertion i e the independence of s s on a connected s follows easily pick any two points s s and a suitably general point t s then apply what we have proved to the pairs s t and s t 18 mark andrea a de cataldo davesh maulik references be be de 1982 faisceaux pervers analysis and topology on
