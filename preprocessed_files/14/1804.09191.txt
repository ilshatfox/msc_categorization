algebraic c embeddings in c 2 the classi fication of such embeddings was recently completed by cassou nogues koras palka and russell based on their classification this paper shows that up to an algebraic change of coordinates there is only one polynomial embedding of the real 1 sphere s 1 in the affine plane r 2 1 introduction let sn denote the real n sphere as an algebraic variety over r daigle asked whether every polynomial embedding of s 1 in r 2 is equivalent to the standard embedding 1 our main result theorem 3 1 gives an affirmative answer to this question this result mirrors the epimorphism theorem of abhyankar and moh and suzuki over a field k of characteristic zero any polynomial embedding of the affine line a 1 k in the affine plane a 2 k is equivalent to the standard embedding 1 11 the complexification of s 1 is the complex algebraic torus c and in contrast to its real counterpart there are infinitely many equivalence classes of polynomial embeddings of c in c 2 the proof of theorem 3 1 relies on the recent classification of closed c embeddings in c 2 due to cassou nogues koras palka and russell found in 3 8 7 see also 6 2 10 the proof of theorem 3 1 also uses the polar group of the real plane r 2 the polar group of a real form of a complex affine variety is introduced in 4 in their classification cassou nogues koras palka and russell show that each equivalence class of closed embeddings of c in c 2 is represented by a polynomial with rational coefficients there fore every polynomial embedding of c in c 2 admits a real form as an embedding the proof of theorem 3 1 shows that if a closed embedding of c in c 2 admits two distinct real forms then this embedding is equivalent to the standard embedding given by xy 1 one is thus led to ask about polynomial embeddings of sn in rn 1 to the author s knowledge there are no known examples of such embeddings which are not equivalent similarly we ask if there exists any polynomial embedding of the torus s 1 s 1 in r 3 the usual rendition of a topological torus as a surface of revolution in r 3 does indeed give an algebraic surface t which is diffeomorphic to s 1 s 1 however it turns out that t is a nontrivial algebraic s 1 bundle over s 1 this is shown in section 4 note that s 1 s 1 is a real form of the complex torus c c which has polynomial embeddings in c 3 for example xyz 1 notation and terminology let r be a ring the group of units of the ring r is denoted r the multiplicative monoid r 0 is denoted r the polynomial ring in n variables over the ring r is denoted r n r n denotes affine n space over r the real n sphere sn is the algebraic variety in rn 1 defined by the polynomial equation x 20 x 2 n 1 a polynomial embedding of s n in rn 1 is of the form f 0 for some f r x 0 xn n n the standard embedding is given by x 2 0 x 2 n 1 two embeddings are equivalent if they differ by an algebraic automorphism of rn 1 date july 4 2019 1 d daigle university of ottawa private

jauslin universite de bourgogne peter russell mcgill university and karol palka warsaw university 2 preliminary results throughout this section a is an affine integral domain over r and b c ra a i a ia assume that b is also an integral domain given f b write f f 1 if 2 for f 1 f 2 a the conjugate of f is f f 1 if 2 2 1 polar groups some facts about polar groups are required as laid out in 4 the element f b has no real divisor if f rg for r a and g b implies r a the set of f b with no real divisor is denoted b and the set of irreducible elements of b is denoted by b 1 theorem 2 1 4 thm 5 1 thm 5 5 assume that a and b are ufds given f b f b if and only if gcd f f 1 let k frac a and l frac b the polar group of a is the quotient group l b k which is denoted a this group is an invariant of a which encodes information about the residual divisors in b over a given f b let f denote its image in a a key feature of this group is that f 1 f 2 2 units and gradings lemma 2 2 suppose that a r if f b then f 1 f for some r proof we have ff 1 1 f f 1 1 f b therefore f f b a a r if f f then f f 1 lemma 2 3 suppose that b has a z grading and let deg be the induced degree function on b if a is a graded subring then deg f deg f for all f b proof given g b let g denote the highest degree homogeneous summand of g note that since a is a graded subring g a if g a suppose that f b and write f f 1 if 2 for f 1 f 2 a if deg f max deg f 1 deg f 2 then deg f 1 deg f 2 which implies f 1 i f 2 0 but then f 1 f 2 0 implies f 0 a contradiction therefore deg f max deg f 1 deg f 2 deg f recall that an n grading of b is a z grading n bn in which bn 0 for n z n lemma 2 4 suppose that b has an n grading and a is a graded subring and let deg be the induced degree function on b suppose that p a is prime in b and a pa r given f b if the image of f in b pb is a unit then either f b or degp 2 deg f proof first note that a pa is a real form of b pb assume that f 6 b let b b pb be the standard surjection by hypothesis there exists h b such that f h 1 therefore there exists q b with fh 1 pq in addition by lemma 2 2 there exists r with h f f therefore there exists r b with h f pr so altogether we can write ff 1 ps for some s b note that s 6 0 since f 6 b by lemma 2 3 we have deg f deg f therefore 2 deg f degp degs degp 2 2 3 polynomial rings in this section assume that a r x y r 2 and b c r a c x y c 2 we consider the standard n grading of a and b wherein x and y are homogeneous of degree one lemma 2 5 let a be such that b c u for some u b then there exists a such that a r if u a then we may take u proof if u a then a r u by cor 3 28 of 5 so assume u 6 a a a is a real form of b b c 1 and it is known that the only real form of c 1 is r 1 see 9 therefore a a r 1 by the abhyankar moh suzuki theorem 1 11 there exists a with a r lemma 2 6 let q x 2 y 2 1 a if p a is such that a pa r a qa then b pb c b qb c t t 1 proof let a 1 a qa and a 2 a pa and let a 1 a 2 be an isomorphism of r algebras let b 1 b qa a 1 z where z 2 1 0 and b 2 b pa a 2 w where w 2 1 0 extend to b 1 b 2 by setting z w then is an r algebra isomorphism and since r z r w we can view as an isomorphism of c algebras lemma 2 7 suppose that u v b satisfy b c u v and v 6 1 in a let p b have the form p vmf 1 for f b and m 1 assume that 1 p a 2 p is irreducible in b 3 a pa r then m 1 and fb v b proof we have p a vmf a vmf v mf since v is irreducible and v 6 1 we see that v b 1 by thm 2 1 gcd v v 1 since v and v are prime it follows that f v mb write f v mg for g b then vmv mg v mvmg implies g g and g a let a a pa be the standard surjection since p vv mg 1 we see that g is a unit of a pa by hypothesis there exists r and t a with g pt if t 6 0 then degp m deg vv degp deg t which is not possible since deg vv 0 therefore t 0 and g a so fb v mb let 1 m c then p vv m 1 since p is irreducible in b m 1 lemma 2 8 let b c t t 1 suppose that fa gb for f g b and a b n relatively prime then there exists h b such that f hb and g ha proof if a 1 or b 1 this is clear so we may assume that b a 1 we first show that for some h b 1 fab gbb fb hbb and gb hab let f df and g dg where d f g b and gcd f g 1 then f ab db agbb and since gcd f g 1 we must have g b therefore f ab db ab by induction we conclude that fb hb ab and db hab for some h b it follows that fb db fb hab hb ab hbb so the implication 1 is proved let c and m n z be such that f tmhb and g tnha then fa gb am bn and a b a n and b m define k m b n a and let c be such that b and a if h tkh then f hb and g ha 3 3 main result let a r x y r 2 and b c r a c x y c 2 the goal of this section is to prove the following theorem 3 1 define q a by q x 2 y 2 1 given p a if a pa r a qa then there exist f g a such that a r f g and p f 2 g 2 1 the proof of this theorem is based on the classification of closed c embeddings in c 2 found in 3 8 7 we show that for almost every c embedding in their classification the induced real form of the representative polynomial embedding is an embedding of r in r 2 there is only one exceptional case and in this case the induced embedding of s 1 in r 2 is equivalent to the standard embedding an important distinction between r and s 1 is that the coordinate ring of r has nontrivial units whereas the units of the coordinate ring of s 1 are trivial the authors of 3 8 7 distinguish three types of closed c embeddings in c 2 those with a very good asymptote those with a good asymptote and the sporadic embeddings these three cases are dealt with in prop 3 2 prop 3 3 and prop 3 4 respectively 3 1 one very good asymptote see 3 thm 8 2 i proposition 3 2 suppose that b c u v and that p b is of one of the following two forms i 1 p u v va uvk g v b with a b 1 and gcd a b 1 k 1 g 0 1 and g otherwise arbitrary of degree at most k 1 i 2 p u v 1 vb a uvk 1 g v b with b a 1 gcd a b 1 k 1 g arbitrary of degree at most k 2 if p a and a pa r then p is of form i 1 with b k 1 and p defines the standard embedding of s 1 in r 2 proof first consider the case v 1 in the polar group a in this case v for c and a by prop 2 5 there exists a such that a r so we may assume that x and y since b c u y c x y it follows that u x y for c and y c y therefore form i 1 becomes p u v p x y y rya sxyk h y b r s r h r y and form i 2 becomes p u v p x y y 1 ryb a sxyk 1 h y b r s r h r y since p a we see that in each case the image of y in a pa is a non constant invertible function meaning that a pa 6 r therefore v 6 1 consider form i 2 by lemma 2 7 we must have b a 1 and b 1 which gives a contradiction therefore p u v cannot be of form i 2 consider form i 1 write p vf 1 for f b by lemma 2 7 fb v b if f v for c and if v v 1 iv 2 for v 1 v 2 a then p vv 1 v 21 v 2 2 1 a r by lemma 2 3 it follows that 2 deg v degp max a deg v deg u bk deg v 2 deg v bk deg v b k 1 we have thus have p va uv 1 v va 1 u 1 f va 1 u u va 1 b v b therefore b c u v c u va 1 v c v v c v 1 v 2 by prop 2 5 a r v 1 v 2 4 3 2 one good asymptote see 3 thm 8 2 ii proposition 3 3 suppose that b c u v and that p b is of one of the following five forms ii 1 vkp v f s p f sp 1 and f uvk g v where s p k 1 g is a polynomial of degree at most k 1 uniquely determined by the condition that g is a polynomial and g 0 1 ii 2 vkp v f s p f sp 1 and f uvk g v where s p k 1 sp 2 g is a polynomial of degree at most k 1 uniquely determined by the condition that g is a polynomial and g 0 1 ii 3 vkp v 16 v 2 4 vf 8 vf 2 f 3 f 4 for f uvk g v where k 1 and g is a polynomial of degree at most k 1 uniquely determined by the condition that g is a polynomial and g 0 1 ii 4 vk 1 p 1 vf s 1 pf 1 for f uvk 1 g v where s p k 1 and g is a polynomial of degree at most k 2 uniquely determined by the condition that g is a polynomial ii 5 vk 1 p 1 vf s 1 p f for f uvk 1 g v where s p k 1 and g is a polynomial of degree at most k 2 uniquely determined by the condition that g is a polynomial if p a then a pa 6 r proof assume to the contrary that a pa r let g b be such that f vg 1 form ii 1 by lemma 2 8 there exists h b pb such that f hp and v f s hsp 1 modulo p therefore v hsp h 1 hp vg 1 hsp h 1 g 1 hp 1 h s 1 p h 1 g 1 consequently h is a unit modulo p which implies that f is a unit modulo p since f 6 b c lemma 2 4 implies 2 degf degp sp degf deg u sp degf s p 1 we thus have vkp v f f 2 v vfg vk 1 p 1 fg by lemma 2 2 f g pl for some l b however the equalities degp degf deg u deg f degf and degg degf deg v imply degp deg f degg thus precluding the existence of the equation f g pl therefore p cannot be of form ii 1 form ii 2 reasoning as in the case of form ii 1 we find that 2 degf degp in this case degp sp 1 degf deg u and it follows that sp 2 assume that s 2 and p 1 then vkp v f f 1 implies that vk 1 p 1 fg by lemma 2 2 f g pn for some n b however the equalities degp degf deg u deg f degf and degg degf deg v imply degp deg f degg thus precluding the existence of the equation f g pn therefore s 1 and p 2 if k 2 then g vh 2 for some h b and vkp v f 2 f vk 1 p v 2 f f vh 2 vk 2 p 1 fh by lemma 2 2 there exist r and m b with f h pm however the equalities degp degf deg u deg f degf and degh degf 2 deg v imply degp deg f degh thus precluding the existence of the equation f h pm therefore k 1 we have vp v f 2 f and f uv 1 which means that p v 2 f uf define h b by h v f then p h 1 u f modulo p we have h 1 u h uh h uv uf h f 1 v 2 f h v f 1 1 therefore 1 u is a unit modulo p by lemma 2 4 2 deg u deg v degp 2 deg 1 u 2 deg u 5 a contradiction therefore p cannot be of form ii 2 form ii 3 if h v 1 f 2 4 v f uf 4 then vh f 2 4 v f 2 4 v f f 2 4 v f 4 f 3 8 vf 2 4 vf 16 v 2 v vkp which implies h f 2 4 v 1 vk 1 p therefore h is a unit modulo p since h 6 b c lemma 2 4 implies 4 deg u 3 k deg v degp 2 degh 4 deg u 2 k deg v a contradiction therefore p cannot be of form ii 3 form ii 4 by definition f is a unit modulo p but f 6 b c therefore by lemma 2 4 degp 2 degf however degp p deg vf s 1 degf k 1 deg v p deg vf s 1 deg u 2 degf which gives a contradiction therefore p cannot be of form ii 4 form ii 5 write vk 1 p fq 1 for q b by lemma 2 2 there exists h b and r such that f q ph however the equalities degp deg vf s 1 p degf deg u degq deg vf s 1 p degf deg f degf imply degp degq deg f thus precluding the existence of the equation f q pm therefore p cannot be of form ii 5 in conclusion a pa 6 r whenever p a and p has one of the forms ii 1 ii 5 3 3 sporadic embeddings see 8 two known families of sporadic embeddings of c in c 2 are parametrized as follows where the second family has only one member 1 x t 2 n t 2 t 1 2 and y t 2 n 4 t 2 t 1 2 where n z n 1 2 x t 4 t 2 t 2 3 and y t 8 t 2 t 1 3 in the first case note that if f 4 xy 1 then f t 4 therefore xfn 1 t 2 n 4 t 2 t 1 2 y 2 t 2 n 3 1 2 xfn 1 y t 2 n 3 we thus obtain the relation y xfn 1 4 16 f 2 n 3 since gcd 4 2 n 3 1 and gcd y xfn 1 f 1 as polynomials in b it follows that this is a prime relation in the second case let f 3 xy 1 g xf 4 9 and h 4 y 3 f 2 then h t 6 and 3 x g 2 h 3 1 fg t 2 this gives the relation h 27 x g 2 h fg 1 3 consider polynomials f g h p b c x y c 2 defined by f 3 xy 1 g xf 4 9 h 4 y 3 f 2 p h 27 x g 2 h fg 1 3 by direct calculation using maple for example we find that p is irreducible and that the highest degree homogeneous summand of p is x 6 y 4 proposition 3 4 suppose that b c u v and that p b is of one of the following two forms iii 1 p v ufn 1 4 16 f 2 n 3 and f 4 uv 1 where n 1 iii 2 p 4 v 3 f 2 27 u g 2 h fg 1 3 where f 3 uv 1 and g uf 4 9 if p a then a pa 6 r 6 proof assume that a pa r form iii 1 by the foregoing discussion f is a unit modulo p since f 6 b c lemma 2 4 implies that if p a then degp 2 degf but this is impossible since degp 4 deg ufn 1 form iii 2 let h 4 v 3 f 2 by the foregoing discussion h is a unit modulo p since h 6 b c lemma 2 4 implies that if p a then degp 2 degh but this is impossible since degp 6 deg u 4 deg v while degh 2 deg u 2 deg v therefore a pa 6 r whenever p a and p has one of the forms iii 1 iii 2 this completes the proof of thm 3 1 4 a remark on s 1 bundles over s 1 let r r s 1 be the coordinate ring of s 1 and let r r a b where a 2 b 2 1 define the affine surface t over r with coordinate ring a r x y x 2 y 2 a 2 2 let t s 1 be the surjective morphism induced by the inclusion r a b a the fiber over r s s 1 is defined by the quotient ring a a r b s r x y x 2 y 2 r 2 2 r r s 1 so every fiber of is isomorphic to s 1 and t is an s 1 bundle over s 1 in a we have 4 a x 2 y 2 a 2 4 x 2 y 2 b 2 5 therefore a r b x y meaning that t admits a polynomial embedding in r 3 the defining polynomial relation is 1 4 x 2 y 2 b 2 2 b 2 1 x 2 y 2 b 2 2 16 x 2 y 2 we thus recognize t as the surface obtained by revolving the circle y 2 2 b 2 1 about the b axis proposition 4 1 t 6 r s 1 s 1 proof due to daigle consider the integral domain b c r a c a b u v uv a 2 2 where u x iy and v x iy then b has a z grading b n 0 bn over c a b in which u and v are homogeneous deg u 1 and deg v 1 in addition b 0 c a b uv c a b bn u nb 0 for n 1 bn v nb 0 for n 1 any unit of b is homogeneous given w b assume that degw n 0 and write w unc for c b 0 if n 6 0 then u b which is absurd since dimc b ub 1 therefore n 0 if degw 0 then in the same way we get degw 0 so degw 0 in any case therefore b b 0 c b b 0 c a b consider c s 1 s 1 c c which has coordinate ring w c s s 1 t t 1 since w c w it follows that b 6 c w therefore a 6 r r s 1 s 1 question does the real algebraic torus s 1 s 1 admit a polynomial embedding in r 3 references 1 s
