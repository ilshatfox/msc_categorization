studies algebraic actions of sl 2 k on affine k domains by defining and investigating fundamental pairs of derivations there are three main results 1 the structure theorem theorem 3 2 describes the

generalizing the classification given by huckleberry for normal complex sl 2 c surfaces 16 3 the exten sion theorem theorem 6 1 describes the extension of a fundamental derivation of a k domain b to b t by an invariant function the classification theorem yields a concise proof of the gen eralized kraft popov theorem showing that every algebraic sl 2 k action on a 3 k is linearizable theorem 5 4 the extension theorem is used to investigate free c actions on cn of the type constructed by winkelmann and finston jaradat 26 9 1 introduction working over a field k of characteristic zero this paper studies algebraic actions of sl 2 k on affine k domains by defining and investigating fundamental pairs of derivations we present three main results the structure theorem theorem 3 2 gives a detailed description of the kernel of a fundamental derivation together with its degree modules and image ideals the classification the orem theorem 4 6 classifies all normal affine sl 2 k surfaces over k with trivial units generalizing the classification given by huckleberry for normal complex sl 2 c surfaces 16 the extension theorem theorem 6 1 describes the extension of a fundamental derivation on a k domain b to b t by an sl 2 k invariant function using the degree modules of the derivation on b to give an explicit set of generators for the kernel of the extended derivation on b t the structure theorem and classification theorem combine to yield a concise new proof that every algebraic sl 2 k action on a 3 k is linearizable theorem 5 4 it was shown by kraft and popov 21 that the action of any connected semisimple complex group on c 3 is linearizable their result was subsequently generalized to all fields of characteristic zero using linearizability of c actions on c 3 see 20 in 26 winkelmann constructed a free c action on c 4 with singular algebraic quotient and a locally trivial c action on c 5 with smooth algebraic quotient which is not globally trivial in 9 finston and jaradat used similar methods to construct a locally trivial c action on c 5 with singular algebraic quotient we generalize these constructions by recognizing and exploiting the role of the underlying sl 2 c module showing in particular that the quotient morphism of such an action cannot be surjective theorem 6 1 the extension theorem gives a simple way to confirm the results of finston and jaradat who used the van den essen algorithm and singular to show that their ring of invariants is generated by 12 elements over c they also showed that the quotient is singular in at least two points and that the ideal of relations for the kernel generators has 155 generators this was the first example of a locally trivial c action on an affine space having a singular algebraic quotient we give a simpler example of a locally trivial c action on c 5 with singular algebraic quotient section 7 4 date august 30 2021 2010 mathematics subject classification 13 n 15 14 j 60 14 r 20 key words and

algebraic action of a connected complex semisimple group on c 4 can be linearized it is not currently known whether this generalizes to fields of characteristic zero the fact that r 4 admits a non linearizable action of the circle group s 1 a real form of the torus r suggests that counterexamples might exist for a real form of sl 2 r see 13 in 25 schwarz used g vector bundles to construct non linearizable actions of sl 2 c on c n for n 7 at present it is not known whether sl 2 c actions on c 5 or c 6 can always be linearized 2 preliminaries throughout k denotes a field of characteristic zero a k domain is an integral domain b containing k its field of fractions is frac b if b is k affine then the dimension of b over k is dimk b the polynomial ring in n variables over b is b n 2 1 locally nilpotent derivations for a k domain b derk b denotes the set of k derivations of b an element d derk b is locally nilpotent if to each b b there is n n with dnb 0 the set of locally nilpotent derivations of b is lnd b for subring r b the set of d lnd b with dr 0 is lndr b let d lnd b be given several basic definitions and properties follow details of which can be found in 11 1 given nonzero b b the least integer n n with dnb 0 is the degree of b relative to d denoted degd b this defines a degree function degd b n 2 let a kerd the kernel of d also denoted bd then a is a factorially closed subring of b being the set of elements of degree at most 0 3 any element r b of degree one is a local slice of d if dr a a and a 6 0 then ba aa r a 1 a here ba and aa denote localization at the set an n n moreover d extends to da on ba and da a d dr if dr 1 then r is a slice for d and b a r 4 the induced dixmier map r ba aa is the surjective map of k algebras defined by r b i 0 1 i i dib r a i 5 if b is generated by b 1 bm over k then a is algebraic over k r b 1 r bm this fact forms the basis of the van den essen algorithm to calculate a generating set for a when both a and b are finitely generated over k see 11 section 8 1 6 the degree modules of d are fn kerdn 1 b b degd b n for n 0 each fn is an a module and b has the ascending n filtration b i 0 fi an algorithm to calculate degree modules is given in 11 section 8 6 7 the image ideals of d are in a dnb dnfn for n 0 this gives a descending n filtration of a the plinth ideal of a is i 1 a db 8 d has the freeness property if d satisfies the following equivalent conditions i fn fn 1 is a free a module for each n 1 ii in is a principal ideal of a for each n 1 9 the degree n transvectant is the a bilinear mapping fn fn a given by f g dn n i 0 1 n idifdn ig lemma 2 1 suppose that b is an integral k domain let d lnd b a kerd and in a dnb n 0 if e derk b and d e 0 then e in in for all n 0 proof given f a de f ed f 0 implies ef a given n 0 and a in let b b be such that dnb a then ea edn b dn eb dnb a in actions of sl 2 k on affine k domains and fundamental pairs 3 lemma 2 2 11 principle 6 let b be a commutative k domain d lnd b and a kerd let b b t b 1 and extend d to b by dt 0 given b b define d lnd b by d d b d dt and let a kerd a d d dt d d dt 0 and d dt restricts to a b if d t a then d d 0 the makar limanov invariant or ml invariant of the k domain b is the k subalgebra con sisting of elements annihilated by every locally nilpotent derivation of b and is denoted ml b b is rigid if ml b b equivalently lnd b 0 note that since every kernel is factori ally closed in b ml b is also factorially closed hence algebraically closed in b therefore if ml b k then k is algebraically closed in b and b k 2 2 ga actions and ga modules assume that b is an affine k domain there is a bijective correspondence between the set lnd b and the set of ga actions on spec b where d lnd b defines the ga action on spec b by exp td t k under this correspondence the fixed point set of the action is defined by the ideal db generated by the image of the corresponding derivation d and the kernel of the derivation equals the ring of invariant functions for the group action in general this ring is not affine but it is always quasi affine 3 27 in case a is affine the algebraic quotient spec a equals the categorical quotient and the quotient morphism p spec b spec a is induced by the inclusion a b 3 the structure theorem for fundamental derivations the lie algebra sl 2 over k is generated by elements x and y with relations x x y 2 x y x y 2 y definition 3 1 let b be a commutative k domain 1 d u lnd b 2 is a fundamental pair if k d u sl 2 k where k d u denotes the lie algebra generated by d and u over k 2 d derk b is fundamental if there exists u lnd b such that d u is a fundamental pair 3 a ga action on b repectively spec b is fundamental if it is induced by a fundamental derivation of b suppose that b is an affine k domain any fundamental pair d u lnd b 2 defines an action of sl 2 k on b thus a ga action on b is fundamental if and only if it factors through an action of sl 2 k in this case the finiteness theorem implies that b sl 2 k is k affine and the theorem of hadziev 15 implies that bga is k affine in addition if spec b is smooth then both of these invariant rings are cohen macaulay see 4 2 5 2 there is a bijective correspondence between fundamental ga actions and pairs of injective homomorphisms ga sl 2 k autk b let be such a pair and let g 1 ga by the lie kolchin theorem we can represent sl 2 k by 2 2 matrices of determinant 1 in such a way that g 1 is the lower triangular unipotent subgroup let g 2 sl 2 k be the upper triangular unipotent subgroup and let t be the subgroup of diagonal matrices with diagonal c c 1 since t gm t induces a unique nontrivial z grading of b called the z grading of b induced by d u since g 1 g 2 ga there exists a unique fundamental pair d u lnd b 2 such that the g 1 action is given by exp td t k and the g 2 action by exp su s k moreover d and u are homogeneous and d u f deg f f for each homogeneous f b the main result of this section is the structure theorem for fundamental derivations 4 gene freudenburg theorem 3 2 structure theorem let b be an affine k domain let d u lnd b 2 be a fundamental pair and let b i zbi be the induced z grading of b with degree function deg let a kerd and keru and for each n 0 let an a bn fn kerdn 1 and in dn fn a in i nai for each n 0 b let f 1 fr a be such that i 1 f 1 fr and set m maxi deg fi then i a a 0 f 1 fr ii in an an m 1 for n 1 iii in e ie 11 iemm for n m 1 where e e 1 em nm i iei n c given n 1 assume that in g 1 gs for homogeneous gi a and set hi ungi 1 i s then

needed to prove the theorem we continue the notation used in the hypotheses of the theorem lemma 3 3 10 lemma 3 2 given homogeneous f a define cn z by cn n deg f n n 1 n 1 a dmunf cnd m 1 un 1 f for all m n 1 b dnunf c 1 cnf for all n 1 proof set e d u the k derivation ad d on sl 2 k is locally nilpotent and acts on the algebra generators by u e 2 d 0 the relation u e 2 u easily generalizes to un e 2 nun for all n 1 we claim that 1 un nun 1 e n 1 i for all n 1 this is clear if n 1 so assume it holds for n 1 then un 1 u un u un nun e n 1 i eun nun e n 1 i une 2 nun n 1 un e ni so equation 1 is confirmed by induction on n in addition for all m n 1 dmun dm 1 und dm 1 dun und dm 1 un by 1 it follows that for all m n 1 2 dmun dm 1 un 1 ud ne n n 1 i therefore if f a is homogeneous then 2 implies dmunf cnd m 1 un 1 f this proves part a and part b follows inductively from part a using m n lemma 3 4 a degd 2 and degu 2 b degu f deg f for every homogeneous f a c ufn fn 1 for each n 0 actions of sl 2 k on affine k domains and fundamental pairs 5 d given d n and f ad the ideal i u if 0 i d is sl 2 k invariant i e di i and ui i proof for any nonzero homogeneous b b we have 2 db d eb e db d deg b b degdb db deg b degdb db which implies degdb deg b 2 so degd 2 choose nonzero homogeneous f a with deg f 6 0 then duf d u f ef deg f f which implies that degu degd 0 this proves part a let n degu f then u nf 6 0 and un 1 f 0 by lemma 3 3 a we have 0 dun 1 f cn 1 u nf n 1 deg f n unf deg f n thus proving part b given homogeneous f a f 0 we haveduf deg f f so uf f 1 assume that ufn 1 fn for some n 1 given homogeneous g fn dg fn 1 implies udg fn it follows that dn 2 ug dn 1 ud e g dn 1 udg deg g dn 1 g 0 ug kerdn 2 fn 1 part c now follows by induction on n if d n and f ad then parts a and b imply udf d in addition lemma 3 3 a shows that du if i d i 1 u i 1 f for each i 0 i d so di i and clearly ui i so part d is proved lemma 3 5 let gi sl 2 k as above where gi ga i 1 2 and let 0 b 0 a bsl 2 k bg 1 bg 2 a 0 0 b a 0 is factorially closed in b and the induced z grading of b restricts to an n grading of a c db 0 proof it is well known that bg 1 kerd and bg 2 keru and that these rings are factorially closed in b since d and u generate sl 2 k it follows that b sl 2 k bg 1 bg 2 kerd keru suppose f bsl 2 k is nonzero then 0 duf ef deg f f implies deg f 0 therefore kerd keru a 0 0 kerd keru kerd keru a 0 0 by lemma 3 4 if f a 0 and f 6 0 then degu f 0 which implies f 0 by symmetry it follows that a 0 0 this proves part a since kerd and keru are factorially closed in b it follows that a 0 kerd keru is factorially closed in b as well suppose that f ad and g a e for positive integers d e since a 0 is factorially closed fegd a 0 implies f g a 0 a contradiction therefore the z grading of b restricts to either an n grading or a n grading of a choose t z t 0 such that bt 6 0 and choose nonzero f bt there exists r n such that drf a and drf 6 0 by lemma 3 4 a degd 2 since t 2 r 0 we see that drf bt 2 r a at 2 r so at 2 r 6 0 therefore the z grading of b restricts to an n grading of a this proves part b if g a ub and g 6 0 then dg 0 and g uf for some nonzero f b so 0 d uf ef deg f f deg f 0 f a 0 0 g uf 0 a contradiction therefore no such g exists and a ub 0 by symmetry keru db 0 thus proving part c we can now give the proof of theorem 3 2 proof by lemma 3 5 b g restricts to an n grading on a define a ideals jn i n ai n 0 6 gene freudenburg noting that j 0 a i 0 given e 1 and nonzero f ae if ci k are defined by ci i e i 1 then ci 6 0 for 1 i e by lemma 3 3 b de uef c 1 cef so f ie and ae ie therefore jn in for all n 0 we proceed to show by induction on n that in jn for each n 0 a basis for induction is established by the equalities i 0 a j 0 assume that for some n 0 ii ji for all 0 i n let f in 1 ae for some e 0 if e n 1 then f jn 1 consider the case e n if e 0 then by lemma 3 5 c we have f in 1 a 0 db keru 0 so we may assume e 1 since f in 1 there exists g fn 1 with dn 1 g f in addition by lemma 3 3 b we have deuef cf where c c 1 ce 6 0 let h dn e 1 cg uef then deh 0 since degd 2 by lemma 3 4 a we see that h b e the inductive hypothesis implies that de 1 h ae 2 ie 1 0 repeating this argument we obtain de ih ae 2 i ie i 0 for 1 i e so h a e 0 by lemma 3 4 b degu f e which implies u ef keru and uef 6 0 since n e 1 0 we see from lemma 3 5 c that uef dn e 1 cg keru db 0 which gives a contradiction so this case cannot occur by induction we obtain in jn for all n 0 consequently jn in for all n 0 thus proving part a for part b it is well known that since a and a 0 are affine a a 0 f 1 fr for any set of generators of the irrelevant ideal n 1 an which is the ideal i 1 bv part a for part ii of b given n 1 let j be the ideal generated by an an m 1 then j in for the reverse inclusion we show by induction on i that an i j for i 0 this holds by definition for 0 i m 1 assume an i j for some i m 1 and let f fd 11 fdrr be a monomial in an i 1 choose j so that dj 6 0 and set g f fj then g is homogeneous and deg g n i 1 degfj n i m 1 n which implies g j so f fjg j and ii is proved by induction part iii of b follows from i and ii for part c since gi in part a implies that deg gi n by lemma 3 4 1 n deg gi degu gi therefore hi u ngi 6 0 for each i and by lemma 3 3 in dnh 1 dnhs this shows fn ah 1 ahs fn 1 we also have f fn b n dnf an degu f n undnf deg f f b n conversely let g n then degd g n implies dng an so g fn b n with this part c is proved lemma 3 5 c shows that given n 0 if mn fn is the submodule mn fn keru fn db then mn fn keru fn db it will thus suffice to show mn fn note that mn 1 mn if n 1 if n 0 then part a implies fn a 0 i 1 f 0 keru df 1 assume by way of induction that fn 1 mn 1 for some n 1 choose nonzero homogeneous g fn say g bd for d z then dng ad 2 n in where dng 6 0 part a implies d 2 n n so d n 0 by lemma 3 4 we have degu d ng d 2 n by lemma 3 3 we have 3 dd 2 nud 2 n dng cdng for some nonzero c k actions of sl 2 k on affine k domains and fundamental pairs 7 if d n 0 then degu d ng n implies undng keru therefore 3 shows undng cg kerdn fn 1 g fn keru fn 1 mn if d n 1 then 3 shows dd nud 2 n dng cg kerdn fn 1 g dfn 1 fn 1 mn therefore mn fn for all n 0 it follows that b db the equality b a ub follows from this by symmetry of d with u so part d is proved the fact that degd 2 was established in lemma 3 4 the fact that d bn bn 2 is injective for n 0 follows from part a let g bd for some d 0 by part c we can write g p db for homogeneous p and b b but then p d 0 so g db therefore bd db when d 1 so d bn bn 2 is surjective when n 1 so part e is proved since degd 2 and degu 2 by lemma 3 4 we have db 2 b 0 and ub 2 b 0 since b 0 kere we see that dup udp for each p b 0 suppose that f b 2 ub 0 then f uh for h b 0 df duh udh ub 2 so db 2 ub 2 and by symmetry ub 2 db 2 therefore db 2 ub 2 part f now follows from part d corollary 3 6 let b be an affine k domain with dimk b 2 under the hypotheses of theo rem 3 2 a a a 0 i 1 a 0 is a retract of a and i 1 is a prime ideal of a b a 0 is factorially closed in a c for each a a 0 and integer n 0 aa in ain d given d n and f g ad f g ud a 0 proof parts a and b follow directly from theorem 3 2 a given a a 0 if a 0 then aa in ain holds so we may assume a 6 0 suppose that f ag for f in and g a theorem 3 2 a implies deg f n since deg a 0 it follows that deg g n by part theorem 3 2 a we see that g in thus proving part c for part d we have degu f degu g d by lemma 3 4 therefore f g u d and deg f g ud deg fu dg d d 2 d 0 so f g ud 0 a 0 corollary 3 7 let b be an affine k domain lnd b 6 0 a ker and i a db suppose that at least one of the following conditions holds 1 i is not a prime ideal of a 2 i is a prime ideal of a but there is no retraction of a with kernel i 3 f where lnd b does not have a slice and f a a then is not fundamental proof if i is not a prime ideal of a then corollary 3 6 a implies that is not fundamental if there is no retraction of a with kernel i then corollary 3 6 b implies that is not fundamental assume that the hypotheses 3 hold then i fi where i a b since fi i we see that af i for every a i suppose that i is a prime ideal of a if f 6 i then a i for every a i which implies that fi i since i 6 0 and b is affine it follows that f a a contradiction therefore f i which implies 1 i also a contradiction so i is not a prime ideal of a and corollary 3 6 a implies that is not fundamental 8 gene freudenburg example 3 8 every linear ga action on a n k is fundamental but this is not generally true for quasi linear actions let b k x 0 x 1 y 0 y 1 k 4 the ga module v 1 v 1 is defined by the linear derivation d on b given by dx 0 dy 0 0 dx 1 x 0 dy 1 y 0 we have a kerd k x 0 y 0 p and a 0 k p for p x 0 y 1 y 0 x 1 the derivation pd is quasi linear since x 0 y 0 0 and x 1 y 1 x 0 y 0 x 20 y 20 x 0 y 0 x 1 y 1 since a b x 0 p y 0 p is not a prime ideal of a corollary 3 7 implies that the ga action exp t on a 4 k is not fundamental lemma 3 9 let b be an affine k domain with nontrivial fundamental pair d u suppose a a 0 x for some x ad d 1 noting that an a 0 xi if n di i 0 and an 0 for n 6 dz a d has the freeness property in particular in i n ai xn d n dz x n d 1 n 6 dz b fn 1 i na hi where h 1 1 and hi u i xi d i dz u i x i d 1 i 6 dz i 0 c b a 0 h 0 hd r rh 1 rhd 1 where r a 0 h 0 hd a 2 0 proof part a is implied by the structure theorem and part b is an immediate consequence of part a for part c since d has the freeness property any set bn n n in b such that dnbn in for each n 0 is an a module basis of b in particular if j n 0 d 1 then b n i j a hndhi r rh 1 rhd 1 lemma 3 10 let d u be a fundamental pair for the affine k domain b then c 1 d cu is a fundamental pair for b for each c b proof every c b satisfies degd c degu c 0 so b kerd keru a 0 see 11 principle 1 it follows that c 1 d cu lnd b set e c 1 d cu from the relations c 1 d e 2 c 1 d and c u e 2 c u we see that c 1 d cu is a fundamental pair for b corollary 3 11 let b be an affine k domain with fundamental pair d u let fn kerdn 1 n 0 and let n 1 be such that b k fn given nonzero a a 0 define submodules gn 0 i n a ifi n 0 and define the subring r k gn then r fn gn for each n 0 and a 1 d au is a fundamental pair for r proof consider a monomial fn for some n n 1 since b fn there exist xi fni with ni n and ei n 1 i m such that an xe 11 xemm and 1 i m eini n therefore an an 1 x 1 e 1 anmxm em r it follows that anfn r for each n 0 which implies gn r for each n 0 actions of sl 2 k on affine k domains and fundamental pairs 9 since a a 0 d u extends to a fundamental pair on ba by lemma 3 10 a 1 d au is a fundamental pair for ba in addition given n 0 lemma 3 4 implies a 1 d aifi ai 1 dfi ai 1 fi 1 i 1 and a 1 d f 0 0 and au aifi ai 1 ufi ai 1 fi 1 i 0 therefore a 1 d and au restrict to r so a 1 d au is a fundamental pair for r the last two results of this section involve extensions of sl 2 k actions their proofs do not require the structure theorem proposition 3 12 let b be an affine k domain and let b be the integral closure of b in frac b every fundamental pair d u for b extends uniquely to a fundamental pair d u for b proof let e d u by seidenberg s theorem d u and e extend uniquely to d u e derk b and by vasconcelos s theorem d u lnd b see 11 proposition 1 19 and principle 16 since e b d u b and b is algebraic over b it follows by 11 proposition 14 that e d u in the same way we see that d e 2 d and u e 2 u so d u is a fundamental pair for b the next result is a special case of a theorem of nagata 23 theorem 8 9 proposition 3 13 let b be an affine k domain and let k k be a field extension such that the ring b k k b is an integral domain let g sl 2 k and g k k g sl 2 k every g action on b extends uniquely to a g action on b where b g k k bg remark 3 14 suppose that v and v are affine k varieties endowed with group actions sl 2 k autkv and sl 2 k autkv then v v is naturally an sl 2 k variety by sl 2 k autk v v at the level of coordinate rings suppose that b and b are affine k domains with fundamental pairs d u and d u respectively let b b k b and extend d u d u to elements of derk b by d b u b 0 and d b u b 0 then x y 0 for x d u and y d u it follows that d d u u is a fundamental pair for b 4 the classification theorem this section classifies normal affine k domains of dimension two with trivial units which admit a non trivial action of sl 2 k i e a non trivial fundamental pair our method requires first a detailed understanding of certain determinantal ideals which are invariant for the irreducible representation of sl 2 k on k n 4 1 quadratic determinantal ideals let b k x 0 xd k d 1 for d 2 the basic fundamental pair on b is the fundamental pair d u defined by dxi xi 1 1 i d dx 0 0 and uxi i 1 d i xi 1 0 i d 1 uxd 0 let b n zbn be the induced grading of b let j b be the ideal generated by the 2 2 quadratic minors of the 2 d matrix x 0 x 1 x 2 xd 1 x 1 2 x 2

a prime ideal defining the affine cone xd ad 1 k over the rational normal curve of degree d see 8 proposition 6 1 the corresponding eagon northcott complex is a minimal free resolution of b j of length d in which each kernel is generated by linear forms 7 in particular the module of first syzygies for b j is generated by the 3 3 minors of the matrices x 0 x 1 x 2 xd 1 x 1 2 x 2 3 x 3 dxd x 0 x 1 x 2 xd 1 and x 0 x 1 x 2 xd 1 x 1 2 x 2 3 x 3 dxd x 1 2 x 2 3 x 3 dxd the surface xd admits a natural sl 2 k action an action which is investigated in the next section thus j and its associated complex are sl 2 k invariant specifically d u invariant we give a basis of j reflecting its structure as an sl 2 k module let m n be such that d 2 m or d 2 m 1 and define t 0 2 t 0 4 t 0 2 m a kerd by t 0 2 i 0 j 2 i 1 jxjx 2 i j let t 2 i denote the d cable rooted at t 0 2 i defined by t j 2 i u jt 0 2 i 0 j degt 2 i 2 d 4 i note that this cable is d u invariant since ut j 2 i t j 1 2 i 0 j 2 d 4

a j t 2 t 4 t 2 m b the sets ma b 1 a b d and t 2 t 4 t 2 m are bases for proof we first show that t 2 t 4 t 2 m j let vd k y z k 2 be the module of binary forms of degree d with basis fi yizd i 0 i d and let b k vd map xi fi then k vd is the coordinate ring of xd and ker j a fundamental pair d u on k vd is given by restriction of the the standard fundamental pair on k y z in particular kerd k y k vd k f 0 k 1 and for this pair is equivariant since t 0 2 i kerd for each i we see that t 0 2 i kerd k f 0 1 i m by homogeneity there exist ri k and ei n such that t 0 2 i rif ei 0 1 i m if ri 6 0 for some i then degree considerations show that either 1 d 2 m i m and t 0 d r k or 2 d 2 m 2 i m and t 0 m rf 0 for r k but then either 1 f 0 fd or f 0 f 0 fd 2 in k y z a contradiction therefore ri 0 for each i and t 0 2 t 0 4 t 0 2 m j since j is d u invariant it follows that t 2 t 4 t 2 m j let w be the k span of the vertices of t 2 t 4 t 2 m since t 2 t 4 t 2 m j it must be the case that w by homogeneity according to 12 lemma 3 8 the vertices of t 2 t 4 t 2 m actions of sl 2 k on affine k domains and fundamental pairs 11 are linearly independent over k the number of such vertices equals m

curve let k x y k 2 with fundamental pair d u x y y x given the integer d 1 let vd be the module of d forms in k x y then d u restricts to the subring k vd and the surface xd spec k vd is the affine cone over the rational normal curve in p 2 k of degree d lemma 4 4 the rings k vd d 1 are normal and pairwise non isomorphic 12 gene freudenburg proof given d 1 define l k xd y x k yd x y frac k vd since k xd y x k 2 and k yd xy k 2 it follows that l is normal since xd y x d xd iyi and yd x y d xiyd i 0 i d we see that k vd l for the reverse inclusion let xiyj l for some i j n then xiyj xd r y x j yd s x y i for some r s n therefore xiyj xdr jyj xd r 1 xd jyj k vd it follows that k vd l and k vd is normal since the isomorphism class of a rational normal curve is determined by its degree the rings k vd for d 1 are pairwise non isomorphic 4 3 smooth sl 2 k surfaces let k x 0 x 1 x 2 k 3 with fundamental pair x 0 x 0 x 1 x 2 2 x 1 x 0 2 x 2 x 1 the ring of sl 2 k invariants is k f for f 2 x 0 x 2 x 21 for each integer d 1 the action restricts to the affine subring k wd where wd is the module of d forms given k define s k k x 0 x 1 x 2 f which is the coordinate ring of a smooth danielewski surface see section 5 and let k x 0 x 1 x 2 s k be the standard projection which is is equivariant the sl 2 k action on s k restricts to each subring k wd let q k k w 2 it is easy to check that k wd s k for odd d and k wd q k for even d lemma 4 5 s k and q k are normal for each k proof it was shown in 1 proposition 2 3 a that s k is normal define a z 2 action on s k by xi xi 1 i 3 then s k z 2 q k this action extends to frac s k k x 0 x 1 and we have k x 0 x 1 z 2 k x 20 x 2 1 frac q k therefore q k k x 2 0 x 2 1 s k which is the intersection of normal rings hence normal 4 4 classification over the field k c normal affine sl 2 c surfaces were classified by huckle berry in 16 proposition 7 see also 18 the list of isomorphism classes for these coordinate rings is comprised of c vd for d 1 s 1 c and q 1 c we generalize huckleberry s result as follows theorem 4 6 classification theorem let b be a normal affine k domain with dimk b 2 and b k if b admits a non trivial sl 2 k action then b is isomorphic to either k vd for some d 1 or to s k or q k for some k among these rings the unique factorization domains are k v 1 k 2 and s k for k such that 6 k proof let k frac b since b k k is algebraically closed in b let d u be a nontrivial fundamental pair for b and let b i zbi be the induced grading of b let a kerd and keru then dimk a 1 and dimk a 0 0 therefore a 0 is an algebraic extension of k so a 0 k since ml b a 0 we see that ml b k by 19 2 14 a k 1 and k 1 by symmetry actions of sl 2 k on affine k domains and fundamental pairs 13 let d 1 and hd d be such that k

fundamental pair on k x 0 xd and ker is invariant see section 4 1 let m be such that d 2 m or d 2 m 1 for each quadratic form t 0 2 i ker 1 i m we have t 0 2 i a k h 0 by homogeneity there exist ri k and ei n with t 0 2 i rix ei 0 ker consider the case where ri 0 for each i by invariance of ker we see that t 0 2 t 0 d ker t 2 t d ker by lemma 4 1 it follows that t 2 t d ker and b k vd consider the case where ri 6 0 for some i then 2 d 4 i degt 0 2 i eid 2 ei d 4 i 4 ei 0 1 which means that either 1 d 2 m i m and t 0 d ker for some k or 2 d 2 m 2 i m and t 0 d 2 x 0 ker for some k assume that d

degm d 2 1 d 2 4 therefore m d 2 1 d 2 1 and m d 2 1 d 2 do not involve t d t 0 d which implies m d 2 1 d 2 1 m d 2 1 d 2 ker in addition by lemma 4 2 there exist c 1 c d 2 k such that m d 2 d 2 1 d 2 i 1 cit d 2 i 2 i and c d 2 6 0 therefore m d 2 d 2 1 c d 2 modulo ker from the syzygy d 2 1 x d 2 1 m d 2 d 2 1 d 2 x d 2 m d 2 1 d 2 1 d 2 1 x d 2 1 m d 2 1 d 2 0 it follows that x d 2 1 c d 2 ker which is a contradiction so the case d 2 m for odd m 3 cannot occur assume that d 4 m for m 2 in this case t 2 t d 2 x 0 t d 2 t d ker 1 by lemma 4 1 the minors m d 4 d 4 1 m d 4 1 d 4 and m d 4 1 d 4 1 are linear combinations of the vertices of t 2 t d 2 we have degm d 4 d 4 1 d degm d 4 1 d 4 1 d 2 degm d 4 1 d 4 d 4 since d 4 we see that d does not divide d 2 or d 4 therefore m d 4 1 d 4 1 and m d 4 1 d 4 do not involve t 0 d 2 or t 0 d which implies m d 4 1 d 4 1 m d 4 1 d 4 ker in addition by lemma 4 3 there exist c 1 c d 4 k such that m d 4 d 4 1 d 4 i 1 cit d 2 2 i 2 i 1 here the cable x

it follows that c d 4 x 0 x d 4 1 ker which is a contradiction so the case d 4 m for m 2 cannot occur therefore either d 2 or d 4 suppose that d 2 then t 0 2 ker and since both t 0 2 and ker are height one primes of k 3 we see that ker t 0 2 therefore b k x 0 x 1 x 2 2 x 0 x 2 x 21 s k suppose that d 4 then t 2 x 0 t 4 ker by direct calculation we find t 0 2 2 x 0 x 2 x 21 t 1 2 4 3 x 0 x 3 x

24 x 2 6 x 1 4 x 1 24 x 2 x 0 24 x 0 ker from this together with the fact that t 0 2 x 0 ker we obtain t 0 2 x 0 ker 2 therefore 6 0 it can be checked directly that the ideal of relations for q k is t 2 2 x 0 t 4 4 2 k x 0 x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 therefore b q k it remains to show that for each k b q k is not a ufd we have hi xi for 0 i 4 the element h 0 is irreducible since it generates the kernel of d in addition 0 t 0 2 2 x 0 2 h 2 h 0 h 21 2 h 0 h 21 h 0 b suppose that h 1 h 0 f for some f b then dh 1 h 0 df k h 0 implies df k and d has a slice which is a contradiction so h 1 6 h 0 b and b is not a ufd this completes the proof note that the number of isomorphism classes represented by the rings s k and q k k depends on the ground field k if k is algebraically closed then s k s 1 k for all k if k r then for r either s r s 1 r or s r s 1 r where s 1 r is a ufd and s 1 r is not a ufd if k q there are infinitely many isomorphism classes for s q q example 4 7 let r x 0 x 1 x 2 r 3 with fundamental

were normal then theorem 4 6 would imply b s r for some r since d 2 but then c r b s 1 c a contradiction since c r b is not an integral domain therefore b is not normal actions of sl 2 k on affine k domains and fundamental pairs 15 5 further applications of the structure theorem 5 1 fundamental pairs for b 1 proposition 5 1 let b be an affine k domain and d u lnd b 2 a fundamental pair let b t b

consequently d u is conjugate to d 0 u 0 proof let n 0 be such that dnf 0 then d n 1 f d dnf 0 so d is locally nilpotent in the same way u is locally nilpotent so part a is proved if deg f 1 then theorem 3 2 d implies f dp for some p b and d t p 0 similarly if deg g 1 then g uq for some q b and u t q 0 consider the case deg f 0 and deg g 0 by direct calculation we find d u d 0 u 0 d 0 g u 0 f

if deg f 2 then duf u 2 f 0 uf a 0 uf 0 f 2 0 the same reasoning applies if g 0 5 2 fundamental pairs for r 2 over r proposition 5 2 let r be an affine ufd over k and b r x y r 2 every nontrivial fundamental pair d u lndr b 2 is conjugate by an element of autr b to the fundamental pair x y y x proof let b ibi be the z grading induced by d u then d u are homogeneous and by lemma 3 4 degd 2 and degu 2 let a kerd keru and k frac r let ai a bi and i bi i z by 2 proposition 2 3 and theorem 2 4 there exist p q b which satisfy the following properties 1 k p q k x y and r p 2 u p where p x py p y px and r p 3 p q r since u is homogeneous is homogeneous and we can assume that p is homogeneous by theo rem 3 2 p ub since r 0 r p and 0 6 r p the fact that 0 is factorially closed in r p implies 0 r therefore rp n for some r r and n n if n 0 then uq r ub 0 by lemma 3 5 a contradiction since otherwise up uq 0 would imply u 0 therefore n 1 let f b be such that uf p then p rpn p f 1 rpn 1 p f n 1 and r r 16 gene freudenburg we thus have ker p r p and p rf 1 by the slice theorem it follows that b r p f and u p f in the same way we find that d s t for some homogeneous s t b with b r s t let d 0 be such that s ad then s 6 r a 0 so d 0 by lemma 3 4 we have uds and uds 6 0 by homogeneity uds pm for some r and m d let ci id i i 1 1 i d it follows by lemma 3 3 that c 1 cds dduds dd pm sd d t d pm m m 1 m d 1 sdpm d p t this implies d m 1 and p t 1 d 1 so us p 1 and t p a 1 0 since uf p we also see that s f 1 0 therefore s f and t p d s t f p 5 3 fundamental pairs for danielewski surfaces let r

f for k the surfaces spec b are known as special danielewski surfaces since f is an sl 2 k invariant the pair d u dmod f u mod f is a fundamental pair for b note that if 0 then b k v 2 and if 6 0 then b s k proposition 5 3 let k x y z k 3 and let t k t k 1 be of degree at least two define b k x y z xy z assume that b admits a nontrivial fundamental pair and let a ker and ker then the following hold a degt t 2 b there exist x a 2 y 2 and z b 0 such that a k x k y z x z y b k x y z and xy z c b k b for some k and is conjugate to d u proof we have b k and it is shown in 1 proposition 2 3 a that b is normal by theorem 4 6 it follows that b is isomorphic to one of the surfaces k vd for d 1 or s k or q k for some k therefore there exist d 1 and h 0 hd b such that b k h 0 hd dhi hi 1 1 i d a k h 0 and k hd since b 6 k 2 we must have d 2 let x h 0 and z h 1 by corollary 3 7 is irreducible therefore 1 lemma 2 8 and lemma 2 10 imply that there exists y b with b k x y z and xy rz s k z for some r k and s k note that y r rz s since x dx and z x it follows that dz x ad 2 since ad 2 0 if d 2 and ad 2 k if d 2 we see that x dz for some k therefore d 2 z z z dz z 2 d 1 z since d 2 we see that degz 2 d 1 z 1 and 2 d 1 z db x rz s degt t 1 degt t 2 write t a 2 t 2 a 1 t a 0 for a 0 a 1 k and a 2 k we have xy rz s a 2 r 2 z 2 2 a 2 rs a 1 r z s y yd 4 y 2 y d actions of sl 2 k on affine k domains and fundamental pairs 17 where xy d k and xy 2 kz y d y 2 0 and y yd 4 if d 4 then the z grading of b k x y z is an n grading which is not the case since deg hd d if d 3 then deg x 3 deg y 1 and deg z

s z 2 for some k since y b 2 and deg y deg x 2 0 we see that k y since z it follows that y 2 z y x xy 2 z z 0 and z y therefore b b and is conjugate to d u 5 4 fundamental pairs for r 3 over r in 21 kraft and popov show that the action of a connected semisimple group g on c 3 is linearizable the main case in their proof is for the group g sl 2 c the following proposition generalizes their result for sl 2 c and its proof gives a new proof of the kraft popov theorem for sl 2 c proposition 5 4 let r be an affine ufd over k and b r x 0 x 1 x 2 r 3 let d u lndr b 2 be a nontrivial fundamental pair for b then d u is conjugate by an element of autr b to either x 0 x 1 x 1 x 0 or x 0 x 1 x 1 x 2 2 x 1 x 0 2 x 2 x 1 proof we first prove the result in the case r k let a kerd and keru by miyanishi s theorem there exist f g a with a k f g k 2 see 11 5 1 since a is a graded subring of b and d is homogeneous we may choose f g to be homogeneous let d e n be such that f ae and g ad if d e 0 then the structure theorem implies f g i 1 since fa ga is a maximal ideal of a we see that fa ga i 1 but i 1 is a principal ideal of a see 11 theorem 5 12 which gives a contradiction therefore either d 0 and e 0 or d 0 and e 0 we may assume without loss of generality that e 0 and d 0 then a 0 k f and a a 0 g by lemma 3 9 it follows that b k f h 0 hd where hi u ig 0 i d let k k f and bk k k f b then bk is a ufd of dimension two over k with b k k the pair d u extends to a fundamental pair dk uk on bk by theorem 4 6 either d 1 and bk k 2 or d 2 and bk s k for some k assume that d 1 then b k f g ug and there is nothing further to show assume that d 2 then b k f g ug u 2 g and bk k g ug u 2 g where 2 g u 2 g ug 2 k b k f let p t k t k 1 be such that p f let k x y z k 3 and consider the mappings k x y

ker ker 2 xz y 2 p f therefore there exist nonzero relatively prime a f b f k f with b f f q x y z a f 2 xz y 2 p f applying x shows b f qx 2 a f z since qx k x y z we see that a f b f k since b f f q

dl ul for bl l x 0 x 1 x 2 by the case for fields there exist x y z bl such that bl l x y z and dl ul equals either x y y x or x y y z 2 y x 2 z y we may assume that x y z b and that x y z are irreducible hence prime in b let il n n 0 be the image ideals for dl since dly x in either case we see that il n x na for each n 0 therefore given n 0 and f in there exists nonzero r r with rf xna since x is prime in a and r 6 xa deg r 0 while degx 0 it follows that f xna so in x na for each n 0 consequently fn a un xn fn 1 n 1 note that u restricts to the subring b r x y z in both cases therefore un x b for all n 0 and it follows by induction that fn b for all n 0 since b r fn for some n 1 we conclude that b b in 24 panyushev generalized the result of kraft and popov to c 4 that is every action of a connected semisimple group on c 4 is linearizable the following corollary to proposition 5 4 is a special case of panyushev s theorem when k c corollary 5 5 let b k x 0 x 1 x 2 x 3 k

affine b let lnd k be the restriction of d du to k then is fundamental c assume that k is algebraically closed the quotient morphism spec b a 1 k spec k induced by e is surjective if and only if a k we first establish the underlying properties of general extensions in proposition 6 2 below 6 1 general extensions let b be any integral k domain let d lnd b d 6 0 and let a kerd let fn b be the degree modules and in dn fn a the image ideals for d n 0 fix nonzero a a let gn fn be the a submodule gn 0 i n a ifi and let r b be the subalgebra generated by n 0 gn n 0 anfn then d restricts to r and the degree modules of d r are precisely gn n 0 likewise the image ideals for d r are anin n 0 let b b u b 1 and extend d to d on b by defining d u a by lemma 2 2 we have d u 0 let k kerd and j k d b by lemma 2 1 u restricts to k and uj j note that k b a let f n k n 0 be the degree modules for u restricted to k let d 0 be the extension of d to b u defined by d 0 u 0 and let ba u ba u be the k algebra automorphism exp u a d 0 let b u b be evaluation at u 0 since ub u k 0 we see that is injective on k actions of sl 2 k on affine k domains and fundamental pairs 19 proposition 6 2 assume that aa in ain for each n 0 a r is an isomorphism of r with k and r idr b if b k fn for some n 1 then r k gn and k k f n c if b is normal then r is normal d if b is a ufd then r is a ufd two preliminary lemmas are needed to prove the proposition let u b a ka be the dixmier map for d given n 0 define the mapping n fn f n n f an u f lemma 6 3 let m n 0 be given a n is an injective map of a modules for

a n u f g a n u f u g a n u f a n u g n f n g so n is an a module homomorphism if n f 0 then f ker u ub a ka if f 6 0 then u k a contradiction therefore ker n 0 and n is injective b m f n g a m u f a n u g a m n u fg m n fg c since the constant term of n p 0 equals a np 0 we see that n p 0 anp u ub k if n p 0 anp u 6 0 then u k a contradiction d given p u f n if g u n p 0 then g u anp u by part c and therefore n degd p 0 degu g u degu p u given f fn if p u n f then anf p 0 and n degd f degd p 0 degu p u lemma 6 4 suppose that aa in ain for each n 0 then for each n 0 f n n i 0 i fi proof let p b u b u ab u be natural surjection and let p x x for x b u then b u ab u b ab u b ab 1 we proceed by induction on n if n 0 then f 0 a 0 f 0 this gives the basis for induction assume that f n n i 0 i

y in 1 20 gene freudenburg therefore g h 0 which implies g af n and y aa in 1 ain 1 so there exists b fn 1 such that y 1 n 1 adn 1 b it follows that degu f a n 1 b n f a n 1 b af n f a f n n 1 fn 1 am therefore af n 1 m am by 11 theorem 8 9 it follows that m f n 1 we can now give the proof of of proposition 6 2 proof given n 0 let g n i 0 a igi gn where gi fi since u f exp uad 0 f when f b we see that g n i 0 i gi f n by lemma 6 4 every element of f n is of this form therefore restricts to an a module isomorphism of gn with f n it follows that r k suppose that b is normal respectively a ufd then b u is normal respectively a ufd and k being the kernel of a locally nilpotent derivation of b u is normal respectively a ufd since r is isomorphic to k by part a r is normal respectively a ufd 6 2 proof of the extension theorem we can now prove theorem 6 1 proof part a follows from the structure theorem and proposition 6 2 part b follows from corollary 3 11 since the isomorphism r k transforms a 1 into d du for part c note that if a k then e has a slice and is surjective consider the case a 6 k let gn f 0 af 1 anfn and let r k gn b let z spec b and x spec r recall from proposition 6 2 that the isomorphism 1 k r is the restriction of the evaluation map b u b sending u to 0 let x y be the isomorphism induced by 1 and let p z x and z a 1 k z be the morphisms induced by the inclusions r b and b b u then the quotient map z a 1 k y factors as p z x y z a 1 k p note that both a and a 0 b sl 2 k are k affine in addition since b is affine each a module fd is finitely generated suppose that 1 a 0 k h 1 hm 2 i 1 t 1 a tla for ti a 3 fi afi 1 afini 1 i n then r k gn k tr hs aifij 1 r l 1 s m 1 i n 1 j ni b since k is algebraically closed and a is not constant we can

and fundamental pairs 21 where r ini k and at least one of the ini is not zero then the fiber of p over is defined by the b ideal jb 1 meaning that this fiber is empty therefore p is not surjective in this case which implies that is not surjective example 6 5 let b k x 0 x 1 x 2 k 3 with fundamental pair x 0 x 1 x 1 x 2 2 x 1 x 0 2 x 2 x 1 we have a k x 0 f k 2 and a 0 k f k 2 for f 2 x 0 x 2 x 21 in addition b k f 2 where f 1 a ax 1 and f 2 a ax 1 ax 2 given nonzero p t k t k 1 let a p f a 0 and form the subring r k f 0 af 1 a 2 f 2 k x 0 f ax 1 a 2 x 2 since 2 x 0 a 2 x 2 ax 1 2 a 2 f we see that r k x y z t 2 xz y 2 p t 2 t b t f p t 2 t from corollary 3 11 and theorem 6 2 we see that r is a ufd with fundamental pair a 1 a note that r is singular if p t has a root in k and if p t is constant then r k 3 these rings define a family of factorial affine threefolds which are sl 2 k varieties equipped with an equivariant birational dominant morphism to a 3 k 6 3 application finite generation of rings of covariants in classical invariant theory a covariant for an sl 2 c module is an invariant for one of the constituent c modules gordan showed that these rings are finitely generated using fundamental pairs proposition 6 2 yields a new proof of this result or at least a new version of the classical proof earlier proofs rely on the transfer principle see 14 proposition 6 6 let b be an affine k domain with fundamental pair d u and a kerd let k x y k 2 and define b b k k x y b x y b 2 with fundamental pair d x y u y x then a b x y sl 2 k in particular a is finitely generated as a k algebra to prove this theorem let keru and fn kerdn 1 likewise define d u d x y u y x and a kerd keru f n ker d n 1 n 0 in addition let d u be the trivial extension of d u to b x 2 then a ker d a x ker u x f n ker d n 1 fn x n 0 given n 0 define g n k f 0 xf 1 xnf n b x and define the map of a modules n f n a by n f xn y f let r a be the k algebra isomorphism from theorem 6 2 a proposition 6 6 is a consequence of the following proposition 6 7 let n 1 be such that b k fn and let r k g n a a k t where t 0 i n i f i b define the map of a 0 modules r by xn for n fn b n then is an injective k algebra homomorphism c is a k algebra isomorphism of with a 0 2 note that d u is not an extension of d u 22 gene freudenburg proof part a is implied by proposition 6 2 for part b injectivity of is clear from its definition in addition when n and m then x n xm xm n gives since is generated by its homogeneous elements is an algebra homomorphism for part c we have that a is an injective algebra homomorphism it must be shown that its image is a 0 to this end suppose that f f n and n f a 0 by the structure theorem deg xnf 0 f b n f n b n f n n f b x n since b x n ix ib n i we see that f ix ib n i for b n i b n i this implies dnf i x idb n i a n b x an x db n i an bn i therefore b n i 0 for i 6 0 and f b n n b n it follows that a 0 a 0 therefore is an isomorphism 7 free extensions of sl 2 c modules in this section k c g sl 2 c and for n 2 vn is the irreducible g module of dimension n 1 in classical terminology vn is the module of binary forms of degree n let b c x 0 xn c n 1 for n 2 let be the basic fundamental pair on b see section 4 1 and let b i zbi be the induced grading of b then deg 2 and deg xi n 2 i 0 i n it is important to note that the grading and induced degree function depend on n a rational basis for a ker is given by t 1 tn where t 1 x 0 ti xi xi i if i is even and ti x 1 xi 1 xi i if i 3 is odd see 11 8 7 1 in particular ti is quadratic for even i and cubic for odd i 3 the first few are t 1 x 0 t 2 2 x 0 x 2 x 21 t 3 3 x 2 0 x 3 3 x 0 x 1 x 2 x 31 t 4 2 x 0 x 4 2 x 1 x 3 x 22 t 5 5 x 2 0 x 5 5 x 0 x 1 x 4 x 0 x 2 x 3 2 x 21 x 3 x 1 x

and du a and let k kerd then c n 2 with the induced ga action is a free extension of the g module vn note that by proposition 5 1 the extended action is not fundamental in order to obtain a set of algebra generators for k from theorem 6 2 we need the degree modules f 0 fn for start with the n grading a i nai given d 1 theorem 3 2 shows that id i dai and from this one finds a set of homogeneous ideal generators id f 1 fr we know from lemma 3 4 that deg fi deg fi d for each i where acts by xi i 1 n i xi 1 0 i n 1 and xn 0 so we can easily calculate gi dfi such that dgi c 1 cdfi for cj k as in lemma 3 3 and thus obtain fd ag 1 agr fd 1 having chosen a a 0 we get the submodules gd 0 i d aifi d 0 actions of sl 2 k on affine k domains and fundamental pairs 23 since b c fn theorem 6 2 implies that k c gn b note that y spec k is rational since frac k c t 1 tn x 0 u ax 1 c n 1 and that the birational inclusion k b gives a polynomial parametrization of y let cn 2 y be the quotient morphism induced by the inclusion k b u as in the proof of theorem 6 1 let x spec c gn and let x y be the isomorphism induced by 1 let p cn 1 y and cn 2 cn 1 be the morphisms induced by the inclusions c gn b and b b u then p cn 1 x y cn 2 p since a 6 c theorem 6 1 shows that p and are not surjective so the ga action on cn 2 cannot be globally trivial however the action can be locally trivial and in this case every nonempty fiber of is connected meaning that every nonempty fiber of p is connected we proceed to construct examples according to the underlying g module vn 1 vnr for each such g module we need to know its degree modules fm however even for f 0 the ring of covariants generators are known only for a few small values of ni and r see 11 section 6 3 7 1 v 1 in this case we obtain a free ga action on c 3 which must be a translation 17 in particular 1 b c x 0 x 1 c 2 and deg x 0 x 1 1 1 2 a c x 0 ad cx d 0 and id x d 0 a 3 f 1 a ax 1 since a 0 c the only choice for a is a 1 so g 1 f 1 and k c f 1 b 7 2 v 2 in this case 1 b c x 0 x 1 x 2 c 3 and deg x 0 x 1 x 2 2 0 2 2 a t 1 t 2 c 2 and a 0 c t 2 c 1 3 since a is generated in degree 2 we need i 1 and i 2 from theorem 3 2 we obtain i 1 i 2 x 0 therefore f 1 a ax 1 and f 2 f 1 ax 2 the simplest choice here is a 1 t 2 and this gives winkelmann s first example 26 lemma 8 we obtain g 2 a af 1 a 2 f 2 a aax 1 aa 2 x 2 which implies k c t 1 t 2 1 t 2 x 1 1 t 2 2 x 2 c x y v w 2 xw v 2 y 1 y 2 b t a t 3 2 t 2 t 1 note that x spec c g 2 has a unique singular point 3 x y v w 0 1 0 0 the fiber of p c 3 x over the singular point is x 0 1 x 21 0 the union of two disjoint lines therefore the ga action is not locally trivial in fact the action is not even proper see 11 3 8 4 3 in lemma 10 winkelmann mistakenly refers to y spec k as a smooth cubic 24 gene freudenburg 7 3 v 1 v 1 smooth case in this case 1 b x 0 x 1 y 0 y 1 c 4 and deg x 0 x 1 y 0 y 1 1 1 1 1 2 a c x 0 y 0 p c 3 where p x 0 y 1 y 0 x 1 and a 0 c p 3 since a is generated in degree 1 we need i 1 from theorem 3 2 we obtain i 1 x 0 y 0 therefore f 1 a ax 1 ay 1 the simplest choice here is a 1 p and this gives winkelmann s second example 26 section 2 since 1 i 1 b u 1 p b u the induced action on c 5 is locally trivial we obtain g 1 a a a ax 1 ay 1 a aax 1 aay 1 which implies k c x 0 y 0 p 1 p x 1 1 p y 1 c x y z v w xw yv z 1 z b t a t 2 t 1 in this case k is smooth 7 4 v 1 v 1 singular case in the previous example choose m 2 and a 1 p m the extended action is again locally trivial since x 0 y 0 j and p x 0 b y 0 b we obtain k c x 0 y 0 p 1 p mx 1 1 p my 1 c x y z v w xw yv 1 z mz thus x spec c g 1 has a unique singular point of order m 1 at x y z v w 0 0 1 0 0 7 5 v 3 in this case 1 b c x 0 x 1 x 2 x 3 c 4 and deg x 0 x 1 x 2 x 3 3 1 1 3 2 a c t 1 t 2 t 3 h where t 2 1 h t 3 2 t 2 3 and a 0 c h in particular h 9 x 20 x 2 3 18 x 0 x 1 x 2 x 3 8 x 0 x 32 6 x 31 x 3 3 x 21 x 22 3 since deg t 1 t 2 t 3 3 2 3 we need i 1 i 2 and i 3 from theorem 3 2 we obtain i 1 i 2 t 1 t 2 t 3 and i 3 t 1 t 3 4 we find elements p 1 1 2 ut 2 3 x 0 x 3 x 1 x 2 p 2 1 4 u 2 t 2 3 x 1 x 3 2 x 22 q 1 1 3 ut 3 3 x 0 x 1 x 3 4 x 0 x 22 x 21 x 2 q 2 1 12 u 2 t 3 3 x 2 1 x 3 3 x 0

2 ax 3 aq 3 the simplest choice here is a 1 h and this gives the example of finston and jaradat studied in 9 since 1 i 1 b u 1 h b u the induced action on c 5 is locally trivial we obtain k c g 3 a ax 1 ap 1 aq 1 a 2 x 2 a 2 p 2 a 2 q 2 a 3 x 3 a 3 q 3 this confirms the result of finston and jaradat who used the van den essen algorithm and singular to find that k is generated by 12 elements over c they also showed that y spec k is singular in at least two points and that the ideal of relations for the kernel generators has 155 generators actions of sl 2 k on affine k domains and fundamental pairs 25 this was the first example of a locally trivial ga action on an affine space having a singular algebraic quotient 7 6 v 1 v 2 b c x 0 x 1 y 0 y 1 y 2 c 5 and deg x 0 x 1 y 0 y 1 y 2 1 1 2 0 2

1 y 1 y 0 x 21 2 since deg x y z 1 2 1 we need i 1 and i 2 from theorem 3 2 we obtain i 1 x 0 y 0 z and i 2 y 0 a i 2 1 and therefore if l 2 x 0 y 2 x 1 y 1 then l z and f 1 a ax 1 ay 1 al and f 2 f 1 ay 2 the natural choice here is a 1 w since 1 i 1 b u 1 w b u the induced action on c 6 is locally trivial we obtain k c x 0 y 0 z v w ax 1 ay 1 al a 2 y 2 is k singular 7 7 v 2 v 2 b c x 0 x 1 x 2 y

t v w c 3 and a 2 d is the vector space of d forms in x y z for d 1 since a is generated in degree 2 we need i 1 and i 2 from theorem 3 2 we obtain i 1 i 2 x 0 y 0 x 0 y 1 y 0 x 1 therefore f 1 a ax 1 ay 1 a x 0 y 2 y 0 x 2 f 2 f 1 ax 2 ay 2 a x 1 y 2 y 1 x 2 a natural choice is a 1 w 1 y 0 x 2 x 1 y 1 x 0 y 2 since choosing 1 t or 1 v just extends v 2 we obtain k a ax 1 ay 1 a x 0 y 2 y 0 x 2 a 2 x 2 a 2 y 2 a 2 x 1 y 2 y 1 x 2 which has 12 generators over c the fiber of p over the point in x c 12 where t v 1 w 1 and all other generators are 0 consists of two disjoint planes 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 in c 6 therefore the action is not locally trivial is k singular 7 8 v 2 v 2 v 2 b c x 0 x 1 x 2 y 0 y 1 y 2 z 0 z 1 z 2 c 9 and deg x 0 x 1 x 2 2 0 2 etc a is generated by the following 13 elements see

generated by elements listed in 6 and 7 elements in 5 are of degree 2 and a 2 d is the vector space of d forms in these elements therefore we need i 1 and i 2 from theorem 3 2 we find that i 1 i 2 is generated by the elements in 5 therefore f 1 a ax 1 ay 1 az 1 a x 0 y 2 y 0 x 2 a x 0 z 2 z 0 y 2 a y 0 z 2 z 0 y 2 f 2 f 1 ax 2 ay 2 az 2 a x 1 y 2 y 1 x 2 a x 1 z 2 z 1 y 2 a y 1 z 2 z 1 y 2 a natural choice here is a 1 since x 0 b y 0 b z 0 b we see that 1 i 1 b u 1 b u and the induced action is locally trivial in contrast to the actions extending v 2 or v 2 v 2 given above we see also that k is generated by 25 elements is k singular 7 9 m i 1 v 1 m 1 b c x 1 y 1 xm ym c 2 m and deg xi yi 1 1 where yi xi 1 a c xi zij 1 j i m where zij yj yi 1 xiyj xjyi with relations xizkj xkzij

sl 2 c vector bundles of rank two in 25 schwarz used the theory of g vector bundles to give the first examples of nonlinearizable actions of complex reductive groups on cn for n 4 for g sl 2 c these
