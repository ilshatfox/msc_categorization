objects over a commutative ring k to the stack of gm gerbes the result is obtained by combining the determinant map from the stack of perfect complexes as proposed by schu rg toe n vezzosi with a relative s construction for tate objects as studied by braunling groechenig wolfson along the way we prove a result about the k theory of vector bundles over a connective e ring spectrum which is possibly of independent interest contents introduction 1 1 preliminaries on k theory 3 2 preliminaries on smooth extended prestacks 11 3 determinant map for perfect complexes 17 4 higher determinant maps 22 appendix a proofs for section 1 27 references 36 introduction let k be a field of characteristic 0 and consider gl the group of continuous automorphisms of k t 1 it is a standard fact see 13 36 and 16 1 that one has a canonical central extension 1 1 gm g l gl 1 in 16 see also 28 for the case when k is any commutative ring the authors construct an analogue of this central extension for gl 2 i e the group of automorphisms of k t 1 t 2 in some appropriate sense see 16 3 1 2 for a discussion of the topology used equivalently as a 2 tate object over k namely they construct a central extension of gl 2 by bgm the picard groupoid over a point this paper originated from two motivations 1 trying to understand the analogue of 16 for higher iterations that is construct central extensions of the group of automorphisms of k t 1 tn 2 have a construction of the group central extension that also gives the lie algebra central extension namely a central extension of gl n the endomorphism lie algebra of k t 1 tn to accomplish the first goal we need to work in a much more general context than 16 the first generalization is that our algebro geometric objects are higher stacks i e functors of points that take values in spaces rather than sets this step is clearly necessary once one is convinced that the central extensions should be by higher deloopings of gm i e k n 1 gm the second generalization is that we need to consider derived stacks or rather prestacks one reason is that it is not clear how to make sense of a geometric object classifying higher tate objects over a scheme without considering perfect complexes the second more serious reason is that to carry out our strategy to achieve the second goal we need to make use of the theory of parametrized formal moduli problems as developed in 17 18 and as explained in their introduction derived geometry is essential for that date october 13 2020 1 equivalently automorphisms of k t as a tate object 1 http arxiv org abs 1907 00384 v 2 2 aron heleodoro the main result of this paper is the construction of a determinant map at the level of prestacks theorem a corollary 4 13 for k a commutative ring one has a map of prestacks over k d t ate bpicgr where t ate is the prestack of tate objects and bp icgr is the prestack classifing graded gm gerbes more generally for any n 1 one has a map of prestacks d n t ate n b n picgr the proof of this result rests in two auxiliary theorems which can be of independent interest they hold in different regimes theorem b holds for arbitrary connective e algebras whereas theorem c only holds for simplicial commutative rings over an arbitrary commutative ring k the first result is of a k theoretic nature it is a variant on the theorem of the heart cf 3 for weight structures theorem b corollary 1 40 let r be a connective e ring the canonical inclusion vect r perf r of the subcategory generated by retracts of finite direct sums of r induces an equivalence k vect r k perf r of connective k theory spectra while this paper was being written theorem b appeared as the main result of 15 we notice that a closely analogous statement was already present in 32 corollary 4 1 and the classical reference 12 has a form of this statement for categories of modules over an e 1 algebra the second result is a statement about when a prestack is smooth extended i e it is the left kan extension of its restriction to the category of smooth affine schemes theorem c theorem 2 13 let k be a commutative ring the derived stack v ect over k is smooth extended i e one has an equivalence of stacks llkesm sm v ect v ect between v ect and the left kan extension of the restriction of v ect to smooth classical affine schemes over k followed by sheafification the proof of theorem c uses an observation by a mathew see 11 appendix a one also needs a concrete description of v ect in terms of a disjoint union of bgln for arbitrary n one reason for the formulation in such a generality of the index map from theorem a is the ease with which we can use it to construct the sought for central extensions theorem d see 4 4 for k an arbitrary commutative ring let l g denote the stack of automorphisms of k t as a tate object one has a canonical central extension 1 gm l g l g 1 furthermore for any n 2 one has a canonical central extension 1 b n 2 picgr l n g l n g 1 where l n g is the stack of automorphisms of the n tate object k t 1 tn the central extensions of theorem d agree with the ones constructed in the literature where they have been defined namely when restricted to classical affine schemes and truncated to a scheme i e set valued functor of points the extension l g agrees with the central extension constructed by frenkel zhu in 16 one advantage of our formulation is that it provides a framework to construct the central extensions of the corresponding higher loop lie algebras in relation with the central extension of groups namely following the steps of 17 for prestacks of tate type one can rigorously take the derivate of the maps in theorem a to obtain a map between dg lie algebras over k i e a central extension of the lie algebra underlying l g and l n g for n 2 the central extensions obtained for those lie algebras should also recover results from 14 this will be the subject of further work we briefly describe the contents of each section section 1 recalls the k theory of waldhausen categories the expert can safely skip this material section 2 has a discussion of functors left kan extended from determinant map for the prestack of tate objects 3 smooth algebras and proves theorem c section 3 develops the main input for the construction of the higher determinant map that is the determinant for the prestack of perfect complexes section 4 constructs the determinant for tate objects and the central extensions conventions unless otherwise stated we have the following terminology this paper is written in the language of categories as developed in 23 unless otherwise noted all categorical concepts categories functors etc and constructions limits left kan extensions etc are to be understood in the sense of categories an ordinary category shall mean a 1 category in the usual sense the term space means an groupoid we will denote by spc the category of spaces all schemes and stacks are derived a prestack means a functor from derived schemes to spaces for most of the generality of this paper one can take the set up of 26 chapter 25 2 a classical scheme means a scheme in the ordinary sense i e non derived acknowledgments it is my pleasure to thank ben antieau emily cliff elden elmanto and jeremiah heller for discussions about different contents of this paper specially i would like to thank a mathew for discussions about how to prove certain results over arbitrary commutative rings i am specially grateful to nick rozenblyum whose continued support during this project made it possible finally i would like to thank the anonymous referee for comments that improved the presentation and the statement of some of the results of this paper 1 preliminaries on k theory this section recalls some definitions and results about the k theory of waldhausen categories 3 this theory was originally developed in 4 and mostly all the results with the exception of theorem 1 35 are contained in there in the appendix we present some proofs which could be illuminating the online notes 25 also contain a good amount of what is discussed in this section note that to prove the equivalence corollary 1 40 we need to construction the determinant map in 3 it is not sufficient to work with the k theory of stable categories cf 6 1 1 set up and definitions 1 1 1 categories with cofibrations we introduce the main kind of categories of which we will study the k theory definition 1 1 a category with cofibrations is a pair c co c c a presentable pointed category and co c a class of morphisms satisfying i for any x c the map x is in co c ii the composition of two cofibrations is a cofibration iii for a map f x y in co c and an arbitrary map x x consider the pushout diagram x y x y f f the map f x y is also a cofibration remark 1 2 we will also use the name waldhausen category for a category with cofibrations as introduced in 4 definition 2 7 one can realize the category of waldhausen categories denoted by wald as a subcategory of an appropriate category of pairs see 4 2 13 and 2 14 for details if the cofibrations are clear from the context we will drop co c from the notation and just write c for a waldhausen category example 1 3 for c a stable category consider comin c the smallest class of morphisms containing 0 x for all objects x in c and stable under pushouts and compositions this defines a category with cofibrations c comin c 2 see 2 1 below for more details on our conventions 3 the categorical analogue of an ordinary category with cofibrations 4 aron heleodoro example 1 4 for c a category with finite direct sums 4 let cosplit c be the class of maps f x y such that f is isomorphic to a map x idx 0 x z for some z c this gives c cosplit c the structure of a category with cofibrations we refer to this choice as the split cofibrations example 1 5 for any presentable pointed category c we can take comax c to consist of all morphisms in c example 1 6 let c be a pointed ordinary category with a class of cofibrations co c in the sense of waldhausen 39 1 1 then nc nco c is a waldhausen category we now introduce waldhausen s s construction for waldhausen categories definition 1 7 for every n 0 we let snc be the subcategory of fun n n n c 5 satisfying i for all i j k the map xi j xi k is a cofibration ii for all i xi i iii for all i j k the diagram xi j xi k xj k is a pushout it is clear that the assignment n 7 snc determines a simplicial object in the category of pointed presentable categories we will denote by s c the simplicial object in spc obtained by passing to the underlying groupoid levelwise remark 1 8 actually for each n op the category sn c comes endowed with cofibrations and one can consider s c as a simplicial object in wald see 4 definition 5 6 one single iteration of the s construction is enough to define the underlying k theory space definition 1 9 for c co c a waldhausen category its k theory space is kspc c s c to upgrade k theory to a spectrum 6 we need to consider iterations of the s construction we first introduce some notation on multi simplicial objects to be able to do that for n op let arn n n n and for each k 1 we will denote by n k n 1 nk an element of op k similarly let arn k arn 1 arnk definition 1 10 let k 1 for each object n k op k we define the subcategory sn k c to be the fiber product sn k c fun arn k c k i 1 snic k i 1 fun arni c where the vertical map is the restriction to each factor and the horizontal one is the canonical inclusion the kth iterated s construction on c is the functor s kc s kc where we pass to underlying groupoids levelwise 4 i e c admits finite limits and colimits and they agree up to a contractible space of choices 5 here n n is the subset of pairs i j n n such that i j and morphisms are those restricted from the category n n 6 we will not consider the non connective version of k theory in this article so any time we refer to the k theory spectrum it is tacitly assumed to be its connective version determinant map for the prestack of tate objects 5 let spc n fun n n op spc denote the category of n simplicial spaces by adjunction this is equiv alent to fun n op spc n 1 i e simplicial objects in n 1 simplicial spaces we consider the adjunc tion 7 fun n op spc n 1 fun n op 1 spc n 1 tr 1 1 sk 1 1 where op 1 op is the full subcategory generated by 0 and 1 hence for any x n spc n one has a counit map sk 1 1 tr 1 1 x n x n which induces a map upon geometric realization 8 2 sk 1 1 tr 1 1 x n x n lemma 1 11 for every k 1 there exists a canonical map 3 s kc s k 1 c proof for s kc we notice that tr 1 1 s kc 0 n k 1 and tr 1 1 s kc 1 n k 1 s k 1 c n k 1 for all n k 1 op n 1 thus one has sk 1 1 tr 1 1 s kc s k 1 c s k 1 c so the map 2 applied to s kc yields the desired map recall that one concrete way to think about the category of spectra spctr is as spctr colim n spc i e the colimit of spc in the category of presentable categories and left exact functors under iterations of the suspension functor definition 1 12 for any category with cofibrations c co c we let k c s c s 2 c be its k theory spectrum with structure maps given by lemma 1 11 remark 1 13 for f c d a functor preserving pushouts and the distinguished point of c f applied to snc levelwise factors through snd inside fun arn d thus any such functor induces a map between the s constructions and its iterations hence between k c k d remark 1 14 notice that given the k theory spectrum associated to a waldhausen category c we can recover its k theory space by k c 0 where k c 0 denotes the 0 th space underlying the spectrum k c 9 remark 1 15 one has a canonical map from the underlying groupoid of a waldhausen category to its k theory space c kspc c indeed since sk trs c c 2 applied to s c gives c s c the map is obtained by taking loops in fact the adjunction spc spctr sp 0 7 this is a partial skeleton and relative truncation adjunction 8 i e the total geometric realization of the n simplicial object 9 this is sometimes denoted k c in the literature 6 aron heleodoro between the category of spaces and the category of spectra gives a map 4 sp sp c sp k c 0 sp kspc c k c we will abuse notation and denote the map 4 by and not make a distinction in notation when we consider c as a spectrum or a space remark 1 16 in fact the map in lemma 1 11 is an equivalence indeed this follows from 4 proposition 6 10 as 4 we let d wald denote the category obtained by formally adjoining sifted colimits to wald thus given any waldhausen category c the colimit s c belongs to d wald and s 2 c as well finally we claim that the functor that sends c wald to s c spc factors through dfiss wald from which our claim follows 1 1 2 additive k theory in the case where c has finite direct sums one can define its additive k theory this is easier to define than the k theory spectrum via the s construction but it is just as good in some situations namely when all the cofibrations are split see theorem 1 19 we don t know of a published reference for this we learned of such results from 25 consider c a pointed symmetric monoidal stable category 10 its underlying groupoid c canon ically has the structure of an e monoid in spaces namely the straightening of the cocartesian fibration defining the symmetric monoidal structure on c thus all one needs to produce a connective spectrum is to ensure that c is grouplike a systematic way of achieving this is by performing a group completion which can be concretely described as c gp b c where b c is the simplicial object in spaces obtained from taking n copies of c on each degree with the corresponding simplicial maps given by multiplication and projections definition 1 17 for c a pointed category with finite coproducts we let kadd c denote the connective spectrum associated to the group like e monoid in spaces b c 11 it is immediate to see that the construction of additive k theory is also functorial in c remark 1 18 for any waldhausen category c with finite direct sums we notice that for each n 1 one has a functor gn bnc snc x 1 xn 7 x 1 x 1 x 2 n i 1 xi where the maps on the right are cofibrations by i and iii of definition 1 1 in particular the above map induces a map kadd c kspc c between k theory spaces by following the correspondence between grouplike e spaces and connective spectra one also has a map kadd c k c of connective spectra one has the following comparison between additive and usual k theories theorem 1 19 suppose that c is a waldhausen category with split cofibrations and finite direct sums whose homotopy category c is additive then the functor kadd c k c described in remark 1 18 is an equivalence we provide a proof of this result in a 4 of the appendix 1 2 main results 10 i e this is a cocartesian symmetric monoidal structure see 24 2 4 3 11 the interested reader is refered to 24 5 2 6 for a discussion about this equivalence which we won t make explicit determinant map for the prestack of tate objects 7 1 2 1 additivity theorem the additivity theorem is a basic important result in k theory in the context of categories with cofibrations it was originally proved by barwick 4 for our convenience we review this statement below assume c is a waldhausen category which admits finite colimits given fun 1 c the category of morphisms one has a functor f fun 1 c c c 5 x f y 7 x cofib f theorem 1 20 additivity the map on k theory induced by the functor f k fun 1 c k c k c is an equivalence of k theory spectra proof the above is a consequence of 4 corollary 7 12 1 in 4 one has that for any pre additive theory for instance wald spc the functor that sends a waldhausen category to its underlying groupoid its additivization 12 is given by kspc c c add s c the result now follows from 4 theorem 7 4 4 remark 1 21 for completeness we give an independent direct proof of this result in a 2 see proposition a 10 1 2 2 fibration theorem in this section we follow 4 9 the formulation of the analogue of waldhausen s generic fibration theorem cf 39 1 6 in the context of categories needs an categorical analogue of the notion of a category with weak equivalences for waldhausen categories since weak equivalences already have a precise meanings associated to it we will follow barwick and use labelled morphisms to refer to the class of morphisms which are the categorical analogue of weak equivalences definition 1 22 a labeled waldhausen category c wc is a waldhausen category c and a collection of labeled morphisms wc which i contain all isomorphisms of c ii satisfy the glueing axiom that is for all x 00 x 01 x 10 x 11 and x 20 x 21 labeled morphisms and maps x 20 x 00 x 10 and x 21 x 01 x 11 the induced map 6 x 20 x 00 x 10 x 21 x 01 x 11 is labeled example 1 23 let c coc wc be a category with cofibrations and weak equivalence in the sense of waldhausen cf 39 1 2 then nc ncoc nwc is a labeled waldhausen category see 4 example 9 3 example 1 24 as in examples 1 3 and 1 5 before one can take wc to contain only the isomorphisms of c or all the morphisms of c respectively before stating barwick s version of the generic fibration theorem we need to introduce some notation and a technical condition suppose c wc is a labeled waldhausen category we consider b c wc colim op bn c wc where bn c wc x 0 x 1 xn xi c 0 i n the superscript denotes that the morphism is labeled remark 1 25 notice that b c wc does not belong to the category wald since this category doesn t admit geometric realizations however it belongs to the category pn op wald 13 obtained from wald by formally adjoining geometric realizations we will denote by wald p n op wald the natural inclusion 12 we refer the reader to 4 theorem 7 4 where this condition is spelled out in seven equivalent forms 13 see 23 5 6 for this notation or also 4 4 14 where this category is denoted d wald 8 aron heleodoro the technical condition for the fibration theorem to hold is an categorical analogue of waldhausen s existence of cylinder functors definition 1 26 let c be a labeled waldhausen category suppose that there exists a functor f fun 1 c fun 1 c and a natural transformation id f such that i f takes labeled morphisms to labeled cofibrations ii if f is a labeled cofibration then f is an equivalence iii if f is labeled then f is objectwise labeled then we say that c wc has enough cofibrations remark 1 27 in 4 barwick defines the notion of c having enough cofibrations as a property of the functor hom c wald spc see 4 definition 9 21 he then proves 4 lemma 9 22 that the concrete conditions of definition 1 26 are sufficient to guarantee that c has enough cofibrations the reason we take those conditions as the definition is that they are what one can actually check about a given labeled waldhausen category the following is 4 theorem 9 24 applied to the case of k theory 14 theorem 1 28 for c wc a labeled waldhausen category with enough cofibrations and let c w x c 0 x the following is a pullback square in spectra 7 k c w k c k b c wc where k denotes the left kan extension of k wald spctr 015 to pn op wald 1 2 3 cell decomposition theorem in this section we discuss a result analogous to 39 1 7 for the case of waldhausen categories this section has some overlap with 15 first we need a definition definition 1 29 let c be a pointed category with finite colimits 16 a weight structure on c is the data of a pair of subcategories cw 0 cw 0 satisfying i cw 1 cw 0 cw 0 and cw 0 cw 1 cw 0 ii for x cw 0 one has homc x y 0 for all y cw 1 iii for any x c there is a decomposition x x x where x cw 0 and x cw 1 we will refer to the subcategory c w cw 0 cw 0 as the heart of the weight structure remark 1 30 the notion of a weight structure was introduced in 7 for a triangulated category but it makes sense in any category with a suspension functor in particular if a stable category c has a weight structure then the triangulated category hc has a weight structure in the sense of 7 definition 4 1 14 namely the additive theory cf 4 definition 7 1 for e spc is taken to be the k theory space functor k i e the additivization cf 4 definition 7 10 of wald spc 15 the reason that one can consider k to be valued in connective spectra is 4 proposition 7 10 16 in 15 stable categories are considered however all that one needs to define a weight structure is a suspension functor on c determinant map for the prestack of tate objects 9 remark 1 31 we notice that weight structure has a flavor very similar to that of a t structure with an important distinction as pointed out in 8 remark 4 4 4 the heart of a weight structure is a notion of projective objects in c so it is not the case that for a stable category c with a weight structure the subcategory c w is abelian we recall another result in k theory in this case simply for motivation theorem 1 32 theorem of the heart 3 for e a stable category with a bounded t structure one has equivalences of k theory k e k e 0 and k e 0 k e one would like to prove a version of the above result for weight structures it is not a surprise that we need some finiteness conditions on the weight structure for this to hold definition 1 33 given a weight structure cw 0 cw 0 one says that i the weight structure is non degenerate if n cw n n cw n 0 ii the weight structure is bounded if n 0 cw n cw n c example 1 34 for spctr the stable category of finite spectra the sphere spectrum s generates a weight structure as follows from the proof of theorem 4 3 2 iii ii in 7 this can be described more explicitly as follows spctr w 0 is the smallest subcategory of spctr containing ns for n 0 and closed under finite extensions and taking idempotents in other words spctr w 0 is the category of finite connective spectra and spctr w 0 is defined to be the orthogonal complement of spctr w 1 17 i e the subcategory of y spctr such that 8 hom y x 0 for all x spctr w 1 since spctr w 1 is generated by 1 s under finite extensions and idempotent completion condition 8 concretely says that y spctr w 0 if and only if hom y ns 0 for all n 1 that is y has integral homology concentrated in non positive degree theorem 1 35 15 theorem 4 1 suppose c is a waldhausen category with a non degenerate and bounded weight structure then k c w k c and k c w k cw 0 are equivalences of spectra we give a proof of this theorem in a 3 of the appendix 1 3 application k theory of vector bundles in this section we apply theorem 1 35 to the case of vector bundles over an affine scheme let r be a connective e ring spectrum and consider the category perf r of compact objects in modr recall that the category vect r of finitely generated and projective r modules is the smallest subcategory of modr containing r and closed under finite direct sums and retracts we denote by mod n r the subcategory of n connective r modules i e those whose homotopy groups vanishes for all k n one has the following concept introduced in 25 lecture 19 definition 1 36 an r module m is said to have projective amplitude n if for any n mod n 1 r one has homr m n 0 the next result is crucial to endow the category perf r with a weight structure 17 notice spctr w 1 is equivalent to the category of finite spectra whose non positive homotopy groups vanish 10 aron heleodoro lemma 1 37 for m perf r the following are equivalent 1 m is finitely generated and projective 2 m is connective and has projective amplitude 0 proof 1 2 recall that by definition an r module m is projective 18 if it is a projective object of mod 0 r i e if the functor homr m mod 0 r spc commutes with geometric realizations in mod 0 r thus for any n mod 1 r consider cn n 0 n 1 0 n 1 n 1 0 a ce ch resolution of n i e colim op c n n 19 so we can compute 0 hom m n 0 homr m c n 0 homr m c n 0 0 2 1 for m perf r we notice that the functor moddisc 0 r spc n 7 hom 0 r 0 m n from discrete modules over 0 r commutes with filtered colimits since 20 hom 0 r 0 m n homr m n thus 0 m is finitely generated so we can pick a morphism p r n m which induces a surjection on 0 consider n cofib r n m by construction one has n mod 1 r so the composite r n n is null homotopic hence there exists a section of p which exhibits m as a direct summand of r n in light of the previous lemma we define a weight structure on perf r as follows let perf r w 0 be the subcategory of perfect modules of projective amplitude 0 and perf r w 0 the subcategory of connective perfect modules lemma 1 38 the categories perf r w 0 perf r w 0 form a weight structure on perf r moreover the heart perf r w is the category of finitely generated projective modules proof for condition i all we have to notice is that if m has projective amplitude 0 then m 1 has projective amplitude 1 which is clear condition ii is true by definition of projective amplitude finally to check condition iii we notice that the inclusion perf r w 0 perf r resp perf r w 0 perf r admits a right adjoint w 0 resp left adjoint w 0 and similarly for perfw n or perfw n for any n hence for any m perf r the canonical adjunction maps give w 0 m m w 1 m whose composite is null homotopic by definition of projective amplitude the second statement is exactly the content of lemma 1 37 proposition 1 39 the weight structure on perf r is non degenerate and bounded 18 see 24 definition 7 2 2 4 and 23 definition 5 5 8 18 19 the geometric realization is taken in the category mod 0 r 20 indeed by the t structure on modr one has homr m n fib homr 1 m n homr 0 m 1 n and homr 1 m n 0 since n mod 0 r determinant map for the prestack of tate objects 11 proof first we check that the weight structure is non degenerate suppose that m perf r w n for all n 0 then for any n perf r n 1 we have homr m n 0 in particular homr m r m 0 so m 0 similarly if m perf r w n for all n 0 then for any n perf r w n 1 homr n m 0 in particular homr r m m 0 now we check the boundedness condition for m perf r by corollary 7 2 4 5 from 24 we know that m perf r n for some n n i e m perf r w n for some n n now assume by contradiction that m has unbounded projective amplitude i e for all n 1 there exists n perf r n 1 such that homr m n 6 0 thus homr n m 6 0 for n perf r n 1 that is a contradiction with m perf r m for some m n proposition 1 39 and theorem 1 35 imply the following result corollary 1 40 let r be any connective e ring spectrum then there is an equivalence of k theory spectra k vect r k perf r where vect r is the category of finitely generated projective modules over r remark 1 41 we notice that the above corollary doesn t follow from barwick s theorem of the heart for t structure even for the ring of dual numbers r k 2 for 1 indeed the category perf r does not have a bounded t structure consider k modr it follows that for all n z 0 n k r n r 0 which is a compact object of mod n r i e k is almost perfect however hom k lim n z 0 hom n k does not commute with filtered colimits i e k is not compact in modr 2 preliminaries on smooth extended prestacks in this section we review basic aspects of the theory of derived algebraic geometry over simplicial com mutative rings for instance as developed in 26 25 1 1 we discuss the concept of a prestack and stack left kan extended from smooth algebras and we prove that the stack of vector bundles over an arbitrary commutative ring k is left kan extended from smooth algebras theorem 2 13 together with the ob servation that over an ordinary commutative ring k all smooth simplicial k algebras are discrete i e have vanishing positive homotopy groups this result will be important to bootstrap the usual determinant from finitely generated modules over an ordinary ring to the category of finitely generated derived modules over a genuinely derived ring 12 aron heleodoro 2 1 stacks smooth extended consider k a commutative commutative ring 21 let alg poly k denote the ordinary category whose objects are finite polynomial rings over k and morphisms k algebra homomorphisms we define the category of simplicial commutative k algebras to be salgk f nalg poly k spc f preserves finite products we refer the reader to 26 remark 25 1 1 3 for a discussion of why this category recovers the usual i e commutative ring objects in simplicial sets definition of simplicial commutative k algebras a prestack over k is a functor x salgk spc we will say that x is a stack if x satisfies e tale descent notation 2 1 we will denote by schaff the opposite of the category salgk the subcategory of classical affine schemes will be denote by c sch aff given a prestack x schaff op spc we denote c x c sch aff op spc its restriction to classical affine schemes given a map f r r in salgk we say that f is formally smooth if the relative cotangent complex lr r is concentrated in degrees 1 i e lr r mod r 1 moreover one says that f r r is of finite presentation if the functor hom salgk r r salgk r spc preserves filtered colimits i e r is a compact object of salgk r the category of simplicial commutative k algebras under r definition 2 2 for a map f r r we say that f is smooth if it is formally smooth and of finite presentation let salgsmk denote the subcategory of salgk consisting of smooth simplicial commutative k algebras notation 2 3 to alleviate the notation we introduce the following sm prestk fun salg sm k spc x 7 smx x salgsm k and lkesm fun salg sm k spc prestk x 0 7 lkesalgsm k salgk x 0 given a prestack x prestk one has a canonical map 9 lkesm sm x x definition 2 4 a prestack x is said to be smooth extended if the map 9 is an isomorphism similarly given x a stack one has a canonical map 10 llkesm sm x x where llkesm means we take the fppf sheafification after the left kan extension definition 2 5 for a stack x one says that x is smooth extended if the canonical map 10 is an equivalence in the next section we will prove that the stack of vector bundles is smooth extended for that we will use a technical observation from a mathew to formulate it we first introduce the following notion given a map f r r of simplicial commutative k algebras one says that f is a henselian surjection if i 0 f is a surjection and ii r 0 f is a henselian pair 22 21 more generally one could consider k a simplicial commutative ring 22 see 33 tag 09 xe for a definition determinant map for the prestack of tate objects 13 proposition 2 6 11 proposition a 0 1 given a prestack x salgk spc suppose that i x preserves filtered colimits ii for every henselian surjection a b the map x a x b is an effective epimorphism 23 iii for every henselian surjection a c b the square x a c b x b x a x c is cartesian then the canonical map lkesm sm x x is an isomorphism 2 2 application the prestack of vector bundles in this section we prove that the stack of vector bundles is smooth extended we start with a review of the stack of vector bundles then we describe this stack as the colimit of a disjoint union of classifying spaces using the criterion from the previous section we prove that this colimit is smooth extended which gives our result 24 for s an affine scheme we let qcoh s denote its category of quasi coherent sheaves and qcoh s 0 the subcategory of connective objects one way to define vector bundles over a derived ring is as 25 vect s f qcoh s 0 f is dualizable in qcoh s 0 for our convenience we recall some equivalent characterizations of vect s proposition 2 7 for f qcoh s 0 the following are equivalent 1 f is a retract of o ns for some n 1 2 f is dualizable in qcoh s 0 3 f is compact and projective as an object of qcoh s 0 i e homr f commutes with sifted colim its 26 4 f is flat and almost perfect 5 f is flat and 0 f is locally free with respect to oc s 27 proof the equivalence between 1 and 2 is 26 proposition 2 9 1 5 the equivalence between 1 and 3 is 24 proposition 7 2 2 7 and the equivalence between 1 and 4 is 24 proposition 7 2 4 20 4 5 notice that by definition f is flat if and only if 0 f is flat and k f k os oc s 0 f for all k 0 moreover since f is almost perfect and connective we have that 0 f 0 f is compact in qcoh s thus finitely presented as a oc s sheaf now it is a classical fact 30 theorem 3 56 that a flat and finitely presented module is projective thus 0 f is projective 5 1 consider n hom f os we can compute in ext i s f os tor i s f os since f is also flat one has in 0 f 0 os i os which vanishes for i 0 because os is connective 23 i e x b is the colimit of x a n b n op 24 the reader is invited to see 11 appendix a for arguments that prove that v ect is smooth extended as a prestack 25 recall that dualizable means that there exists g qcoh s 0 and maps e f g os and os g f s t f f os idf f g f e idf os f f is isomorphic to idf one also ask a similar condition for g 26 the condition of being compact corresponds to hom f commuting with filtered colimits whereas projective means hom f commutes with geometric realizations by 23 lemma 5 5 8 14 any sifted colimit is a combination of those 27 i e 0 f is a vector bundle over c s 14 aron heleodoro remark 2 8 for s an affine scheme recall f qcoh s is a projective object if the functor homs f commutes with geometric realizations moreover if f is finitely generated then homs f commutes with sifted colimits in particular for any f vect s the functor homs f commutes with sifted colimits the main object of interest for us is the prestack v ect sch aff op spc s 7 vect s we first observe the following standard fact lemma 2 9 the prestack v ect satisfies descent with respect to the flat topology i e it is a stack proof since the assignment s 7 qcoh s satisfies descent with respect to the flat topology see 26 corollary d 6 3 3 and s 7 qcoh s 0 satisfies descent as well by 26 theorem d 6 3 1 it is enough to check that the condition of being a vector bundle i e to be dualizable is local with respect to the flat topology this is exactly 26 proposition 2 9 1 4 before giving the proof that the stack of vector bundles is smooth extended we introduce an auxiliary stack that we can describe more concretely than v ect for each n 1 let gln salgk spc be defined as the pullback 11 gln r mn r gln 0 r mn 0 r where mn r is the n 2 affine space over r of n n matrices we notice that gln is represented by an affine scheme over k namely gln r homsalgk an r where an k xi j 1 i j n det xi j 1 where det xi j is the determinant formula for the entries of an n by n matrix proposition 2 10 for any n 1 the canonical map 12 llkesm smgln gln is an equivalence proof we will apply proposition 2 6 we notice that in the defining diagram 11 the terms gln 0 r mn 0 r and mn r all commute with filtered colimits since filtered colimits commute with finite limits so condition i holds for gln r since gln is representable by 19 the ore me i 8 for any henselian surjection f r r the map gln r gln r has a section which implies that it is an effective epimorphism for condition iii we notice that since gln is representable by an it commutes with limits thus the canonical map lkesm smgln gln is an equivalence the equivalence of 12 follows from the fact that gln satisfies flat descent i e the map llkesm smgln llkesm smgln is an equivalence determinant map for the prestack of tate objects 15 now consider the prestack defined by schaff op spc s 7 bgl s b gln s where b gln s is the simplicial object whose value on m op consists of m copies of gln s and maps are the canonical projections and inner multiplications let bgln denote its fppf sheafification thus we have the stack bgl n 0 bgln proposition 2 11 the canonical map llkec c bgl bgl is an equivalence of stacks proof fix n 0 we first notice that passing to classifying spaces is given by a geometric realization which commutes with left kan extensions thus from proposition 2 10 one has 13 b lkesm smgln lkesm b smgln lkesm smbgln bgln since sm also commutes with geometric realizations if we sheafify both sides of 13 one obtains an equivalence llkesm smbgln llkesm sm bgln bgln where the last somorphism follows from the fact that sheafification is also given by a colimit finally since llkesm and sm commute with disjoint unions we are done we notice that there are canonical maps of prestack bgln v ect that send the unique s point of bgln to o n s in particular these assemble to a map of prestacks 14 bgl v ect by lemma 2 9 the map 14 factors through the sheafification of bgl f bgl v ect lemma 2 12 the map 15 f bgl v ect is an equivalence of stacks proof we need to check that for any r salgk and f v ect r there exists a flat cover r r such that f r r is a finitely generated free r module proposition 2 9 2 3 from 26 says that we can do even better that is even zariski locally any vector bundle is trivial more precisely the result states that there exists a collection of elements x 1 xm 0 r such that i xi generate the unit ideal of r i e r r x 1 i i i is a zariski cover and ii f r r x 1 i is finitely generated and free for every i since any zariski sheaf is also an fppf sheaf this finishes the proof theorem 2 13 the canonical map llkesm sm v ect v ect is an equivalence of stacks 16 aron heleodoro proof we notice that we have the following commutative diagram llkesm sm bgl bgl llkesm sm v ect v ect here the right vertical arrow is an equivalence because of lemma 2 12 the left vertical arrow is an equivalence because llkesm sm is a functor finally the top horizontal arrow is an equivalence by lemma 2 11 we consider the stacks of line bundles pic defined as pic r f v ect r f is locally free of rank 1 where locally free of rank 1 means that after a zariski base change as described in the proof of lemma 2 12 fi is finitely generated of rank 1 we will also consider the stack of graded line bundles picgr defined as picgr r f mod r f is invertible with respect to the symmetric monoidal structure corollary 2 14 the canonical maps llkesm sm pic pic and llkesm sm picgr picgr are equivalences of stacks proof for the first statement we notice that the restriction of 15 to bgl 1 factors through pic and the induced map bgl 1 pic is an equivalence of stacks indeed by proposition 2 9 4 2 a line bundle i e invertible object of vect r is a quasi coherent sheaf that is locally free of rank 1 the claim now follows from the proof of proposition 2 11 for the second statement we notice that by 26 remark 2 9 5 8 one has an equivalence picgr pic l et z where l et z denotes the e tale 28 sheafification of the constant presheaf with value z thus it is enough to check that the map llkesm sm l et z l et z is an isomorphism by 24 theorem 7 5 0 6 one has an equivalence salg et k c salgk et between the category of e tale k algebras and the nerve of the ordinary category of classical e tale k algebras since we supposed k 0 k similarly see 38 theorem 2 2 2 6 we have salg sm k c salg sm k finally since the e tale and smooth topologies on classical k algebras give the same notion of sheaves one has l et c z l sm c z where l et c z denotes the e tale sheafification of the classical prestack into a classical stack and l sm c z denotes the smooth sheafification so we obtain llkesm sm l sm c z l et z where tautological we have sm l sm c z sm l et z 28 indeed by a result of toe n see 37 theore me 2 1 the e tale and fppf sheafification agree determinant map for the prestack of tate objects 17 3 determinant map for perfect complexes in this section we construct the main input for the determinant map of tate objects namely we construct a determinant map for the prestack of perfect complexes we follow the ideas of 31 3 1 recollection on the determinant of classical rings in this section r 0 will always denote an ordinary commutative ring we let kspc r 0 denote the k theory space of vect r 0 n mod fgp r 0 i e the nerve of the ordinary exact category of finitely generated projective r 0 modules we denote by c k the classical prestack associated to this construction remark 3 1 notice that ck is not a classical stack the main reason is that it doesn t satisfy e tale descent however if one constructs connective k theory as a presheaf of connective spectra then it does satisfy zariski descent when restricted to qcqs schemes by 35 theorem 8 1 however it still does not satisfy e tale nor flat descent cf 34 we also consider cpic the classical prestack that sends an ordinary ring r 0 to the underlying groupoid of the subcategory pic r 0 vect r 0 of invertible elements i e l pic r 0 such that there exists a dual l and the evaluation equivalently coevaluation map l l r 0 is an equivalence from the descent of v ect r 0 and the fact that the invertibility condition is local for the flat topology we have that cpic is a classical stack it is actually a classical group stack 29 with group structure given by the restriction of the tensor product on vect r 0 more generally we will be interested in the group stack cpicgr whose r 0 points are the underlying groupoid of category of graded lines over r 0 30 with tensor product that takes into account the degree the following is a well known fact theorem 3 2 there exists a map of classical prestacks cd ck cpicgr moreover the truncation of cd to a map of 1 groupoids 31 followed by zariski sheafification is an isomorphism proof the first claim follows from 5 corollary 12 17 by passing to the underlying space of their functorial map of connective spectra the second claim is 5 proposition 12 18 for our goal in the next section it will be convenient to make explicit the construction that produces the map cd from theorem 3 2 for r 0 an ordinary commutative ring we let vect r 0 denote its groupoid of finitely generated projective modules and picgr r 0 denote the groupoid of graded line bundles both vect r 0 and picgr r 0 r 0 are symmetric monoidal groupoids the following is a standard fact lemma 3 3 one has a symmetric monoidal functor 16 detgr vect r 0 picgr r 0 given by detgr m rk m m rk m for the next section we will need a rephrasing of lemma 3 3 the assignment n op 7 vect r 0 n grpd 29 i e a group object in the category of classical stacks 30 more formally we define cpicgr r 0 to be the sub groupoid of modr 0 spanned by its invertible elements 31 by that we mean the composition of the functor defined by each prestack with the truncation functor 1 spc spc 1 from groupoids to 1 groupoids i e the left adjoint to the natural inclusion 18 aron heleodoro defines a simplicial object in grpd the 2 1 category of groupoids more precisely one has weak functors 32 b vect r 0 op grpd and b pic gr r 0 op grpd lemma 3 4 the symmetric monoidal functor 16 determines a weak natural transformation 33 det gr r 0 b vect r 0 b pic gr r 0 functorial in r 0 remark 3 5 from 21 b 3 theorem 1 3 6 one knows that there exists an equivalence between the strict 2 category fun op grpd of weak functors and weak natural transformations between them and the 2 category of categories fibered in groupoids over op the construction that sends a weak functor f op grpd to the category fibered in groupoids over f op is the grothendieck construction informally the objects of f are n opf n and morphisms between n x and m y where x f n and y f m are given by hom f n x m y hom op n m homf m f x y by remark 3 5 one has a map 17 d et gr r 0 bvect r 0 bpic r 0 of categories fibered in groupoids over op the following is a compatibility result that we will need in the construction of the determinant as a map of simplicial objects in groupoids lemma 3 6 consider c an ordinary symmetric monoidal groupoid and let b c op grpd be the simplicial object 34 encoding its symmetric monoidal structure then one has an equivalence of symmetric monoidal groupoids 35 n b c b n c here the righthand side is the simplicial object in spc given by the bar construction applied to n c construction 3 7 by 23 proposition 2 1 1 3 one has that n bvect r 0 n op and n bpic r 0 n op are right fibrations of categories moreover the map d et gr r 0 induces a map of right fibrations n d et gr r 0 by lemma 3 6 we notice that n bvect r 0 un b n vect r 0 and n bpic r 0 un b n pic r 0 are isomorphic as right fibrations over n op where un b n vect r 0 denotes the right fibration over n op obtained from the functor b n vect r 0 op spc 36 and similarly for n pic r 0 let 18 d etr 0 un b n vect r 0 un b n pic r 0 denote the map of right fibrations induced by n d et gr r 0 we notice that this map is functorial in r 0 since all the constructions were functorial by applying the straightening functor one obtains the map 19 det r 0 b n vect r 0 b n pic r 0 32 see 33 tag 003 n for what we concretely mean by that 33 we refer the reader to 21 b 1 for a definition of this notice that in 21 this is called a pseudo natural transformation 34 this is a weak functor into the 2 1 category of groupoids 35 strictly speaking the nerve functor on the lefthand side is a coherent nerve from grpd into spc and not simply the nerve functor from 1 categories to categories 36 see 23 determinant map for the prestack of tate objects 19 in particular one can restrict the functors above to the category of smooth algebras we will denote the resulting functor 37 20 det r 0 b n smvect r 0 b n smpic r 0 thus by taking the loop space of the geometric realization 38 of 19 one obtains the map cd ck r 0 c pic r 0 remark 3 8 it is clear that the map from construction 3 7 agrees with the one on proposition 12 3 from 5 12 3 2 construction of determinant for derived rings in this section we fix a base commutative ring k the main goal of this section is to prove the following theorem 3 9 let r be a connective dg algebra over k there exists a map of group like e monoids in spaces d k r k perf r picgr r functorial in r in particular one obtains a map of prestacks over k 21 d perf picgr where perf denotes the prestack associated to perf i e perf r perf r proof the proof consists of a couple of steps step 1 by corollary 1 40 we have an equivalence k vect r k perf r thus it is enough to construct a map out of k vect r step 2 by theorem 1 19 we notice that kadd vect r k vect r is an equivalence we also notice that for a picard groupoid 39 p one has an equivalence p kadd p as group like e monoids in spaces indeed by 24 definition 5 2 6 2 an e monoid p is grouplike if the canonical map m p 2 p p p p is an equivalence since any x p has an inverse x 1 we notice that the map p p p p given by x y x y 1 y is an inverse to m p 2 since kadd p is the group completion of p p this gives the claim thus it is enough to construct a map of simplicial objects in spaces 22 b vect r b pic gr r indeed by taking loop space on the geometric realization of 22 one obtains k vect r kadd vect r b vect r b pic gr r k picgr r picgr r step 3 by theorem 2 13 and the fact that llkesm commutes with products for each n op there is an equivalence llkesm bn sm v ect r bnv ect r and similarly for picgr r by corollary 2 14 since bn sm v ect r bn smvect 0 r 37 we use the same notation sm for the restriction of a prestack and a classical prestack to a functor from the category of smooth k algebras and classical smooth k algebras hopefully this will not cause confusion 38 i e a concrete model for the group completion of our e monoid in spaces 39 i e a symmetric monoidal groupoid where all objects are invertible 20 aron heleodoro one can take the sheafification of the left kan extension of 20 from smooth k algebras to all k algebras to obtain the map 23 d b v ect r b pic gr r taking the geometric realization of 23 and loop spaces yields dk r it is clear from the construction that dk is functorial and the map d is obtained by precomposing dk with perf r k perf r from 4 suppose that x is any derived stack let perf x mapsstk x perf by applying the map 21 we obtain a map of stacks 24 dx perf x pic gr x remark 3 10 the result of theorem 3 9 appears in a similar form in 31 in the particular case where k is a field of characteristic 0 in the case where x is a classical scheme the truncation 1 dx is the classical determinant map as constructed in 22 remark 3 11 notice that it is unclear if we can expect that the determinant from theorem 3 9 can be generalized for even connective e rings the main point is that for e algebras there are less functors which are left kan extended from smooth e algebras the reason being that this notion is not so well behaved as in the case of simplicial commutative rings a piece of evidence that such an extension might not exist is example 4 5 from 2 where the authors show that it is not possible to construct a map from the k theory of the sphere spectrum to its non graded picard stack of line bundles 3 3 computation the map induced on tangent spaces in this section we specialize to the case where k is a field of characteristic 0 see 17 chapter 2 for the conventions on derived geometry for this set up the reason that we restrict to this case is that we use the theory of deformation theory as developed in 18 chapter 1 to compute the cotangent complexes involved let f x y be a map between prestacks with deformation theory and locally almost of finite type according to 18 chapter 7 for every point x s x one obtains a map tx x 1 tf x y 1 between dg lie algebras in this section we will describe more explicitly what this map of lie algebras is for 21 let s recall the following construction for any s schaff and g qcoh s 0 we can consider the square zero extension of s defined as sg spec s os g this comes equipped with maps g s sg and pg sg s induced by the maps of sheaves of algebras os g os and os os g respectively in the case where g os we will abbreviate those maps as and p the tangent complex tx v ect is characterized by the property that for any g qcoh s k 0 qcoh s k one has 25 homqcoh s g tx v ect kmapss sg k v ect for some k such that g k qcoh s 0 the subscript on the mapping space means we consider maps y that fit into the diagram sg s v ect y g x determinant map for the prestack of tate objects 21 in the particular case where g os let fx v ect s denote the vector bundle corresponding to x s v ect we can understand the right hand side of 25 as 26 fy qcoh sos fy fx lemma 3 12 the tangent complex of v ect is tx v ect homs fx fx 1 fy qcoh sos fy fx proof we prove the right isomorphism the left isomorphism follows from the definition of the tangent complex let s identify oos os where 2 0 let fy be a os module such that fy fx consider the fiber sequence p os os os of os modules tensoring it with fy yields p fx fy fx hence fy is determined by the map fx p fx 1 of os modules since homsos p fx fx os 1 homs fx p fx os 1 homs fx f os 1 this finishes the proof let s analyze more concretely what the correspondence of lemma 3 12 gives us suppose one has 0 homs os txv ect this corresponds to an element ext 1 s fx fx since fx is a vector bundle this ext group vanishes 24 proposition 7 2 2 6 3 in other words up to a contractible space of choice there is only one os module fy whose restriction to s recovers fx however if one considers 0 homs os 1 txv ect this gives an element in ext 0 fx fx i e an actual endomorphism of fx by 25 one obtains that corresponds to an automorphism of y over x i e a map between the fiber sequences 27 fx fy fx fx fy fx idfx idfx to determine we fix an isomorphism fy fx as os modules it is easy to see that f g f g f where f g are local section of fx recall that for e perf s a perfect complex one has a canonical trace morphism tr homs e e os indeed e has a dual e and given any map f homs e e one defines tr f to be the composite os coeve e e e e id e f e e eve os the following result has its proof sketched in 31 proposition 3 13 the map induced on tangent spaces by ds ds homs fx fx 1 homs rk fx fx rk fx fx 1 os 1 is the trace morphism on perfect complexes 22 aron heleodoro proof we notice that the discussion about the tangent space applies to the stack perf given any fx perf s and homs fx fx 1 we have the diagram 27 associated to idfy if we apply the map d to this diagram one obtains rk fx fx rk fy fy rk fx fx rk fx fx rk fy fy rk fx fx idfx rk fy idfx thus the map ds homs rk fx fx rk fx fx 1 is determined by id rk fy fy rk fy idfy rk fy since 2 0 one obtains that d d det idfy id rk fy fy tr this finishes the proof 4 higher determinant maps in this section we will bootstrap the determinant map of perfect complexes to a map from the prestack of tate objects in section 4 1 we recall the definition of tate objects in section 4 2 we introduce the construction that allows one to deloop the determinant map the last two sections 4 3 and 4 4 construct the higher determinant map and apply it to obtain central extensions of loop groups 4 1 recollection on tate objects the notion of tate objects for categories was first introduced in 20 2 here we take a slightly different approach where we keep track of cardinalities to avoid having to consider a bigger universe which is closer to the approach of 9 where tate objects are defined for ordinary exact categories and was suggested in 1 remark 2 34 given a regular infinite cardinal we denote by cat the category of essentially small categories 40 and catst the subcategory of stable categories and exact functors between these for the rest of the paper we fix regular infinite cardinals definition 4 1 for any c cat one has ind objects in c the category ind c is the subcategory of fun c op spc generated by those functors which commute with small colimits pro objects in c the category pro c is the subcategory of fun c spc op generated by those functors which commute with small limits elementary tate objects in c the category tateel c is the smallest subcategory of ind pro c containing the essential images of pro c and ind c and closed under finite extensions tate objects in c the category tate c is the idempotent completion of tate el c the reason we consider the constructions with respect to a smaller cardinal is to obtain the following result lemma 4 2 the categories ind c pro c tate el c and tate c are essentially small i e equiv alent to some category which is small proof for ind c this is an immediate consequence of 23 proposition 5 3 5 12 i e ind c is equivalent to the compact objects in p c fun c op spc and the latter category is essentially small by 23 example 5 4 1 8 the result for pro c follows by passing to opposite categories and for tate el c and tate c follows from the result for ind pro c moreover if one consider c a small stable category then one has 40 see 23 1 2 15 for a discussion of this and 23 proposition 5 4 1 2 for a definition determinant map for the prestack of tate objects 23 lemma 4 3 for c catst the categories ind c pro c and tate c are all small stable cate gories proof the proof follows from 20 corollary 2 7 notice that because of lemma 4 2 we can iterate the construction above definition 4 4 for any n n let taten c be the nth iteration of the tate construction applied to c remark 4 5 from now we will drop from the notation of ind pro and tate as we won t consider any other cardinal this should not cause any confusion 4 2 relative s construction the idea for the construction in this section is originally due to brauling groechenig and wolfson in 10 3 1 we essentially mimic their construction adapting it to categories let n 1 we have two inclusion maps sr arn 1 arn and sc arn 1 arn given by sr i j i 1 j and sc i j i j i e sr adds a row to the arrow diagram and sc adds a column we denote by s r s c snc sn 1 c the corresponding restriction functors definition 4 6 for every n 0 we define g rnc as the following pullback g rnc sn 1 pro c sn 1 ind c sn 2 ind pro c sn 1 ind pro c sn 1 ind pro c s r s c it is equipped with canonical maps g rnc en tateel c and g rnc s r s c snc the first map is explicitly given by evaluation at n n arn and the second map is given by forgetting the last column and then further forgetting the first row remark 4 7 for n 0 g r 0 c consists of diagrams x 0 0 x 0 1 x 0 2 x 1 1 x 1 2 x 2 2 in ind pro c where the subdiagram x 0 0 x 0 1 x 1 1 belongs to ind c and the subdiagram x 1 1 x 1 2 x 2 2 belongs to pro c since x 0 0 x 1 1 x 2 2 0 by definition we have that g r 0 c is equivalent to pushout squares x 0 1 x 0 2 0 x 1 2 24 aron heleodoro in ind pro c where x 0 1 ind c and x 1 2 pro c notice that by definition x 0 2 belongs to tateel c the following observation is behind the construction of the index map lemma 4 8 for any v tateel c let g rn v e 1 n v one has g rn v fun n g r 0 v proof indeed by 24 lemma 1 2 2 4 one has an isomorphism snc fun n 1 c functorial in c applied to the pullback diagram defining g rnc we obtain g rnc fun n pro c fun n 1 ind c fun n 1 ind pro c fun n ind pro c 2 s r s c since fun n 1 ind pro c fun n fun 1 c and we can commute fun n with the pullback to obtain the equivalence g rnc fun n g r 0 c the result for v follows from taking the fibers by the naturality of the construction the categories g rnc assemble into a simplicial object we let gr c denote the simplicial space obtained by passing to the underlying groupoid levelwise and e gr tateel c the map to the underlying groupoid of the category of elementary tate objects seen as a constant simplicial object in spaces corollary 4 9 the map induced by e upon geometric realization 28 e gr c tate el c is an equivalence proof for any v tateel c the fiber of e is the geometric realization of g r v the latter is levelwise isomorphic to fun n g r 0 v by lemma 4 8 by 20 theorem 3 15 one has that g r 0 v is cofiltered which implies that for each n op the space grn v is contractible and so is the geometric realization of gr c corollary 4 9 allows us to define the map 29 d tateel c gr c s r s c s c where we keep the same names s r and s c for the maps induced upon the geometric realization of the underlying simplicial spaces remark 4 10 for any k 1 we can consider s k c instead of c in the statements of lemma 4 8 and corollary 4 9 and they can be proved in the same way moreover the corresponding equivalence maps ek gr s k c s k tate el c are compatible with the suspension maps exhibiting the structure of a spectrum on s tateel c s 2 tateel c similarly to 29 by remark 4 10 we obtain maps 30 d k s k tateel c g r s k c s k 1 c for each k 1 those assemble to give corollary 4 11 there is a map of spectra dc k tate c bk c where bk c is the suspension of the spectrum k c determinant map for the prestack of tate objects 25 remark 4 12 one notices that k tate c k tateel c because of morita invariance of k theory see 6 or 4 another reason why one obtains bk c as the target of dc above is that the target spectrum is explicitly given by the sequence of spaces s 2 c s 3 c and one has equivalences s kc s k 1 c for all k 1 by remark 1 16 4 3 determinant of tate objects for any integer n 1 and derived ring r i e connective dg k algebra we can inductively define the category taten r tate taten 1 perf r where tate 0 perf r perf r in particular for any n 1 one obtain prestacks t ate n schaff op spc s 7 taten perf s similarly one can also consider the prestacks b n picgr sch aff op spc s 7 bb n 1 picgr where b 0 picgr picgr and for any group object a in prestacks one has ba colim n op a n with simplicial maps induced by the group structure the construction from the previous section can be iterated to give 31 d n perf s k taten perf s bnk perf s for any s schaff op in particular since there are maps t aten s k taten perf s and n 2 bnk perf s b n picgr s one obtains the following corollary 4 13 for any n 1 there exists a map of prestacks 32 d n t ate n b n picgr remark 4 14 since the map 32 is obtained as the restriction of a map 31 of k theory spectra one can informally say that 32 can be enhanced to witness the multiplicative property of the determinant more precisely if one thinks of the category of n tate objects in perfect complexes as a cocartesian symmetric monoidal category with respect to direct sum then the functor d n has a symmetric monoidal structure suppose that x is any prestack one can consider the moduli of n tate objects over x as follows 41 t ate n x mapsprestk x t ate n by composing with 32 one obtains a map 33 d n x t ate n x b n picgr x where b n picgr x is the space of n picgr gerbes over x remark 4 15 in 31 they used the map 24 for n 0 and x a k 3 surface to prove that the derived moduli of simple perfect complexes with non negative self ext s and fixed determinant is smooth we reiterate their remark that we expect the map 33 to be useful in moduli space problems which can be related to the moduli space of tate objects 41 notice that here mapsprestk denotes simply taking hom as prestacks and not the mapping stack i e there is not stackification after 26 aron heleodoro remark 4 16 more generally if one wants to formulate the property that the determinant also splits non split fiber sequences of n tate objects in perfect complexes then one needs to formulate the map d n as the 0 th level map of certain higher segal objects in the category of prestacks we plan to pursue this characterization in some future work 4 4 application central extension of iterated loop groups we can now reap the fruits of our higher determinant map in this section we take k to be an arbitrary commutative ring given v taten k one considers the group prestack g v s auttaten s v k os in particular we let l n g g k t 1 tn denote the group prestack whose r points are l n g r auttaten r r t 1 tn the determinant map 32 gives a map 34 d n s l n g s aut b n picgr d n s os t 1 tn b n 1 picgr s indeed one notices that for any g b n picgr s one has a canonical equivalence aut b n picgr g s b n picgr s b n 1 picgr s lemma 4 17 the map 34 is a map of group prestacks proof this follows automatically from the fact that d n is a map of prestacks definition 4 18 the central extension of l n g is defined as l n g fib d n s where the fiber is taken in the category of group objects in prestacks remark 4 19 for v k t 1 tn the map d n v spec k b n picgr determines d n v spec k a b n 1 picgr torsor over spec k the fibers of l n g l n g are canonically equivalent to aut d n v we now compare the central extension l g l 1 g with previous constructions in the literature we need some notation first let c t ate denote the restriction of t ate to the category of classical schemes c sch aff op namely c t ate r tate perf 0 r notice that for 0 r an ordinary commutative ring one can consider tate 0 r the ordinary exact category of tate objects over mod fgp 0 r the exact category of finitely generated projective modules over 0 r we claim that there is a map 42 35 tate 0 r h c tate r indeed for a an ordinary commutative ring the canonical inclusion of 43 moda perf a induces a map between the associated tate constructions tate mod fgp a tate perf a by passing to the underlying ordinary homotopy category and underlying ordinary groupoid one obtains the map 35 let c d c t ate c bpicgr be the map of classical prestacks obtained by applying c to 32 for n 1 consider c d 1 the composite of c d with 1 the localization from spaces to 1 truncated spaces 42 here hc denotes the ordinary homotopy category underlying the category c 43 recall that the category of perfect modules over a commutativer ring a can be concretely described as compact objects in the category ndg ch a i e the dg nerve see 24 construction 1 3 1 6 of the differential graded ordinary category of chains complexes of a modules determinant map for the prestack of tate objects 27 lemma 4 20 the restriction of c d 1 r to tate 0 r agrees with the map b detgr index tate 0 r bpic gr 0 r of 10 section 3 44 in particular the space of sections spec 0 r c d r v is as described in proposition 5 1 of 10 proof we first notice that by 26 proposition 2 9 6 2 one has an equivalence 1 bp icgr b 0 picgr bpic gr 0 r the compatibility of the maps follows from the functoriality of the construction of the index map in both cases let lg denote the functor 0 c l g c sch aff op spc 0 set where 0 is the postnikov truncation of spaces to 0 trucanted spaces i e discrete sets by applying the same functors to l g we obtain a central extension 1 gm l g lg 1 i e l g 0 c l g proposition 4 21 the central extension l g agrees with the central extension denoted by g l in 16 1 2 3 proof by remark 4 19 one notices that fib l g lg aut c d 1 k t hence it is enough to identify the later with the description in frenkel zhu from lemma 4 20 one has that aut c d 1 v is non canonically isomorphic to automorphism of the determinantal theory that sends l 0 k t to k and any other lattice l k t to rk l k t l k t l k t l k t this is clearly equivalent to the set of automorphism the determinant line bundle over the affine grassman nian gr at l 0 as one can see from the proof of proposition 1 6 from 16 remark 4 22 when k is a field of characteristic 0 we expect the restriction of l 2 g to classical prestacks recover the central extension of 16 section 3 3 denoted gl in loc cit remark 4 23 more generally for k an arbitrary commutative ring we also expect that the restriction of l 2 g to classical prestacks to recover the central extension defined in 5 2 of 28 appendix a proofs for section 1 in this section we prove some of the main results about k theory that we summarized in 1 our goal is to present some of the arguments in a slicker form than what can be found in the literature though all of those results were already in 4 25 and 15 44 in 10 they use the notation picz for picgr and similarly for the determinant map 28 aron heleodoro a 1 realization fibrations in this section we introduce a preliminary technical tool developed by rezk in 29 which allows for a simple proof of the additivity theorem in the next section definition a 1 let i be a small category and f x y a morphism in fun iop spc we say that f is a realization fibration if for every pullback x x y y f the diagram obtained by taking the colimit over i colimi x colimi x colimi y colimi y f is a pullback diagram in spc remark a 2 notice that any map f which induces an equivalence upon passing to colimits is a realization fibration diagram and that the class of such is stable under pullbacks in 29 the following definition is introduced as part of the local to global principle to check that a map is a realization fibration definition a 3 let j be a small category f g j c be functors and p f g a natural transforma tion one says that p is j equifibered if for every morphism f j 2 j 1 in j the diagram f j 2 f j 1 g j 2 g j 1 f f p p g f is a pullback square rezk then proves the following useful criterion 45 proposition a 4 29 theorem 2 6 let j be a small category f g j p i 46 functors and p f g a natural transformation suppose that p is a j equifibered map and that for each j j the map p j f j g j is a realization fibration then colim j f j colim j g j is a realization fibration in the particular case when i rezk proves the following result which can be seen as a way to bypass the kan condition lemma a 5 29 proposition 5 4 for f x y a map of simplicial spaces if for all m op the map y m y 0 induces an isomorphism on 0 then f is a realization fibration an important consequence of lemma a 5 is the following lemma a 6 for any m op and any waldhausen category c the maps i q m s m 1 c smc 45 notice that in 29 this is phrased in the language of model categories but the argument goes also works for the category that we consider here 46 here p i is the category of space valued presheaves on a small category i determinant map for the prestack of tate objects 29 ii p m s m 1 c s c where q m is the projection onto the last m 1 elements and p m is given by the projection onto the first elements of the simplicial set induce equivalences upon geometric realization 47 proof we prove i the argument for ii is completely analogous since c is pointed smc is contractible hence it is enough to check that the map p m is a realization fibration by lemma a 5 it is enough to check that it induces an equivalence on 0 and that again follows from the fact that sm 1 c is pointed a 2 additivity theorem our exposition is heavily influenced by the paper 27 first we introduce some notation and prove a couple of preliminary results for x fun n op c a simplicial object in a category c we denote by xr and xl the bisimplicial objects obtained as xln m xn and x r n m xm suppose that f c d is a functor between waldhausen categories then we have an induced functor s f s c s d of simplicial objects in wald we consider the bisimplicial object s 2 f d whose value on n m is defined as the following pullback 36 sn m f d snc sn m 1 d snd fn p m n where p m n is the projection onto the first n 1 elements of sn m 1 d 48 as before we will denote by unscripted s the corresponding objects obtained by passing to the underlying groupoid by construction we have maps of bisimplicial objects f 2 s 2 f d s l 2 c and f 2 s 2 f d s r 2 d where fn m is the composite of the projection onto sn m 1 d with d n 1 0 sn m 1 d smd proposition a 7 the following are equivalent a the map s f induces an equivalence upon geometric realization b the map f 2 induces an equivalence upon geometric realization proof consider the diagram 37 sr 2 d s 2 f d s l 2 c sr 2 d s 2 idd d s l 2 d s 2 idd f 2 f 2 s 2 f s l 2 f id d 2 id d 2 we claim that 1 s 2 idd 2 idd 2 3 idd 2 and 4 f 2 induce equivalences upon geometric realization the claim for 1 is clear i e isomorphisms are realization fibrations for 2 notice that for each m op idd m is the composite s mf d s m 1 d q m smd where the first map is induced by the pullback of idd in the defining square of s mf d thus the first map of the composition induces an equivalence upon geometric realization by lemma a 6 i the second map also induces an equivalence upon geometric realization 47 we are considering smc as the constant simplicial object in spaces 48 i e the composition of the m 1 face maps dk for n 1 k n m 1 30 aron heleodoro for 3 and 4 notice that for any functor f c d and m op one has fib f m fib p m where p m n sn m 1 d snd so the result follows again from lemma a 6 ii here is essentially a reformulation of proposition a 7 in the language of a 1 proposition a 8 if the map of bi simplicial objects f 2 is a realization fibration then so is s f proof let e be a simplicial space and consider the pullback diagram e s c e s d s f this induces two pullback diagrams of bi simplicial space by considering the functors l and r applied to everything in sight now consider the e 2 and e 2 defined as the following pullbacks e 2 e l 2 s 2 idd d s l 2 d id d 2 and e 2 e 2 e 2 e 2 thus we obtain the following diagram living over the diagram 37 38 sr 2 e e 2 e 2 sr 2 e e 2 e 2 sr idd s f rf pf sl f ridd pidd where the maps are the pullback of the corresponding maps in diagram 37 by considering the new six term diagram fib 38 37 and passing to its geometric realization we see that if f 2 s 2 idd idd 2 idd 2 and f 2 are realization fibrations then so is s 2 f however by proposition a 7 the maps s 2 idd idd 2 idd 2 and f 2 induce equivalences upon geometric realization this finishes the proof the final piece to prove the additivity theorem is the following proposition a 9 for any functor f c d between waldhausen categories the induced map of bi simplicial spaces f 2 s 2 f d s r 2 d is a realization fibration proof notice that the geometric realization of any bi simplicial set e 2 is equivalent to colim m op e m where e m is the geometric realization of n 7 en m thus we are in the situation to apply 29 theorem 2 6 we check its two conditions 1 for all m m in the diagram s m f d s mf d sm 1 d sm 1 d is a pullback diagram this follows immediately from the definition of s 2 f d see diagram 36 determinant map for the prestack of tate objects 31 2 for all m op the map f m s m d sm 1 d is a realization fibration where the right hand side is the constant simplicial space sm 1 d this follows from lemma a 5 recall the set up of the additivity theorem for c a waldhausen category we considered the functor f fun 1 c c c given by evaluation on the source and taking the fiber of the morphism proposition a 10 for any waldhausen category c the functor f induces an equivalence of k theory spectra proof from the construction of k theory see 1 1 1 it is enough to prove that the induced map 39 s fun 1 c s c s c induces an equivalence upon passing to geometric realization equivalently if one considers the fiber of 39 over the first factor of the right hand side one has a fiber sequence 40 s c s fun 1 c s c where the first factor was identified with the s construction of the category whose objects are x c with a map from c which is equivalent to c so it is enough to check that 40 induces a fiber sequence upon geometric realization i e that the map s fun 1 c s c is a realization fibration this follows from proposition a 8 and proposition a 9 applied to the functor ev fun 1 c c a 3 cell decomposition theorem in this section we give the proof of theorem 1 32 we follow closely the strategy of waldhausen cf section 1 7 in 39 for alternate accounts the reader is refered to 15 and 25 lectures 19 and 20 let c be a waldhausen category that admits finite colimits equipped with a bounded and non degenerate weight structure cw 0 cw 0 we introduce the category of cell decomposition for each n 0 let en c be defined as the following pullback 41 en c fnc c w c n w n i 0 cw i q where c nw cw n cw n and fnc is the category of objects x c with an n step filtration i e fnc x 0 x 1 xn i xi c and the map q is given by q x 0 x 1 xn x 0 x 1 x 0 xn xn 1 notice that for any n the category cw n is a waldhausen category where the cofibrations are those maps that are cofibrations in c and whose cofiber belongs to cw n similarly for cw n and c n w the categories fnc are also waldhausen categories see 4 definition 5 6 thus the category en c is a waldhausen category since the category wald admits finite limits see 4 proposition 4 4 we now endow the category en c with a labeling where we say that a morphism f x y belongs to wen c if fn xn yn is an equivalence the strategy of the proof is to apply the fibration theorem theorem 1 28 to c n wc n and take the colimit on n we first prove some lemmas that identify the categories that will show up 32 aron heleodoro lemma a 11 for n 1 the natural map en c w c w given by inclusion into en c and projection into the first factor is an equivalence of waldhausen categories proof we proceed by induction on n the base case is clear since it consists of objects x 0 0 where x 0 c w and the projection just sends x 0 to itself in c w suppose that the result holds for n 1 and consider the fiber sequence xn 1 xn xn xn 1 where xn 0 by definition of en c we have that xn xn 1 c n w hence one has w n 1 xn xn 1 since xn 1 cw n 1 this gives that xn 1 0 lemma a 12 for n 1 one has an equivalence of waldhausen categories n en c w c 1 w c n w en c proof again we proceed by induction for n 1 one has the functor 1 x 0 0 y x 0 x 0 y which clearly gives an equivalence for general n we consider the functor en 1 c c n w en c given by x 0 xn 1 xn x 0 xn 1 xn 1 xn this also gives an equivalence so the result for n follows from the result for n 1 lemma a 13 one has an equivalence of waldhausen categories colim n 1 en c c proof we first note that an object x colimn 1 en c is a filtered object such that xn xn 1 for some n 0 thus the map from the colimit is just sending an object to its stable part to check that this is an equivalence we use the bounded condition of the weight structure on c thus the map x 7 w 0 x w 1 x w nx w n 1 x is an inverse to the previous maps lemma a 14 for every n the labeled waldhausen category en c wen c has enough cofibrations proof by definition 1 26 we need to produce an endofunctor f of fun 1 en c and a natural transfor mation id f satisfying the three properties of the definition given an object x f y fun 1 en c represented by a diagram 42 x 0 x 1 xn 1 xn y 0 y 1 yn 1 yn f 0 f 1 fn 1 fn we inductively define f x f y as follows f xn xn and f yn yn and for i n we let f xi yi yi 1 f xi 1 the natural transformation id f is the natural map from xi to the pullback yi yn xn f xi notice that the maps f xi f xi 1 are cofibrations because those are isomorphic to the maps yi yi 1 we now check the conditions of definition 1 26 condition i recall that f is labeled if fn is an equivalence thus we need to argue that if fn is an equivalence then 42 is a cofibration in fn c barwick describes the cofibrations in fn c as diagrams determinant map for the prestack of tate objects 33 42 where any square is a cofibration as a morphism in f 1 c then lemma 5 8 from 4 characterizes a map in f 1 c as a cofibration if g 0 is a cofibration in the diagram z 0 z 1 w 0 w 1 g 0 g 1 and for any u extending the above diagram to z 0 z 1 w 0 u w 1 g 0 g 1 h y the map h is a cofibration in our example we obtain the diagram yn 1 yn xn xn yn 1 u yn f n fn h where the map f n is an equivalence since it is the pushout of an equivalence and fn is an equivalence by assumption thus h is an equivalence in particular it is also a cofibration condition ii we need to show that f is an equivalence for any f a labeled cofibration we recall that barwick defined the cofibrations on f 1 c as the smallest class generated by a z 0 z 1 w 0 w 1 and b z 0 z 1 w 0 w 1 y we notice that by construction of f we only need to check that xi f xi yi yi 1 f xi 1 for 0 i n 1 since f xi yi it is enough to check that fi xi yi is an equivalence for all 0 i n 1 when fn is an equivalence and a cofibration by applying the description of cofibrations we see that either fn is the pushout of fn 1 by b or that fn 1 is an isomorphism in either case we obtain by induction that fi is an isomorphism for all 0 i n condition iii we need to check that if f is labeled then f is objectwise labeled i e xn f xn is an equivalence which follows from the definiton of f theorem a 15 let c be a waldhausen category that admits finite colimits equipped with a bounded and non degenerate weight structure cw 0 cw 0 then the canonical inclusion map k c w k c is an equivalence of k theory spectra 34 aron heleodoro proof consider en c wen c which is a labeled waldhausen category with enough fibrations by lemma a 14 so we can apply theorem 1 28 to obtain the following fiber sequence k en c w k en c k b en c wen c by lemma a 11 and lemma a 12 we can rewrite the upper row of the above diagram to get 43 k c w k c w c 1 w c n w k b en c wen c thus by the additivity theorem see theorem 1 20 we identify 44 k b en c wen c k c 1 w c n w finally by taking the colimit on n of the diagram 43 and using that filtered colimits commute with fiber sequences we obtain k colimn c w k colimn 1 en c colimn 1 k n i 1 c i w the term on the lower right corner vanishes by an eilenberg swindle argument and lemma a 13 gives the desired result this finishes the proof of the theorem remark a 16 consider the following modification of diagram 41 en c fnc cw 0 cw n 1 cw n n i 0 cw i t where t is given by t x 0 x 1 xn w 0 x 1 w 1 x 2 w n 1 xn xn we can proceed exactly as we did in this section to obtain the result that the canonical map k cw 0 k c is an equivalence of spectra for c satisfying the same conditions as in theorem a 15 a 4 additive k theory in this section we prove theorem 1 19 recall that we have c a waldhausen category which admits finite direct sums we constructed a map in remark 1 18 which induces a map between the underlying groupoids 45 gn bnc snc given by gn x 1 xn x 1 x 1 x 2 n i 1 xi remark a 17 for a pointed category c if its homotopy category c is additive then for every x y c the canonical map x y x y admits a splitting the following lemma is key prove the comparison result determinant map for the prestack of tate objects 35 lemma a 18 suppose that c is a waldhausen category with split cofibrations and finite direct sums such that hc is additive for every n 2 consider the action of bn 1 c on snc given as an bn 1 c snc snc y 1 yn 1 x 1 xn 7 x 1 x 1 y 1 x 1 y 1 y 2 xn n 1 i 1 yi then snc bn 1 c c i e the one sided bar construction is an equivalence in the category of spaces proof it is enough to consider the fiber of the above map over a fixed object z c let sncz be the subcategory of snc spanned by objects of the form z x 2 xn this subcategory has coproducts given by taking the coproduct relative to z thus its underlying groupoid sncz is an e monoid in spaces the action an on snc restricts to the sub groupoid sncz and we claim that 46 sncz bn 1 c we have a map gn 1 bn 1 c sncz given by gn 1 yi i an yi i z z z and equation 46 is equivalent to 47 cofib gn 1 we notice that gn 1 is surjective on 0 thus cofib gn 1 is automatically grouplike hence it is contractible if and only if its group completion is contractible now we consider the map sncz qn 1 bn 1 c z x 2 x 3 xn 7 x 2 z x 3 x 2 xn xn 1 from the definition it is clear that qn 1 gn 1 is the identity on bn 1 c we check that the opposite composition naturally satisfies 48 gn 1 qn 1 idsncz idsncz idsncz which will prove that gn 1 qn 1 is homotopic to the identity upon group completion indeed the left hand side of 48 applied to z x 2 xn gives z x 2 z z z 2 z x 3 x 2 x 2 z x x 3 x 2 x 2 z whereas the right hand side of 48 applied to z x 2 xn gives z x 2 z x 2 x 3 z x 3 however remark a 17 implies that the fold map x 2 z x 2 x 2 has a canonical splitting by the inclusion of x 2 i e x 2 z x 2 x 2 x 2 z this finishes the proof of the lemma proposition a 19 let c be a waldhausen category with split cofibrations and finite direct sums moreover assume that c is an additive category 49 then the maps 45 induce an equivalence kadd c k c 49 for c a prestable category this condition is automatically satisfied see 24 lemma 1 1 2 9 36 aron heleodoro proof note that due to the dold kan equivalence we can think of the spectra kadd c and k c as grouplike e monoids that is one has an adjuction 49 e mon spctr gp between e monoids and spectra thus applying the unit of 49 to kadd c we obtain kadd c b c b c gp b c gp where in the last term we apply the group completion level wise and the equivalence follows from the fact that group completion commutes with colimits similarly one has k c s c s c gp s c gp where as above we apply group completion level wise and the last equivalence follows for the same reason hence its is enough to show that the maps 45 induce equivalences after group completion for each n 2 we consider the diagram 50 bn 1 c bnc snc c c fn 1 ev 1 id where 1 x 1 xn 1 0 x 1 xn 1 1 is the projection onto the first factor and ev 1 x 1 xn x 1 we want to prove that the maps fn are equivalences after group completion it is enough to prove that the right squares are pullback squares after group completion since the category e mon is stable this is the same as proving that the right square is a pushout square after group completion we notice that the left square is a pushout diagram so we are reduced to proving that the outer square is a pushout diagram after group completion this follows from lemma a 18 references 1 benjamin antieau david gepner and jeremiah heller k theoretic obstructions to bounded t structures invent math 216 2019 no 1 241 300 mr 3935042 2
