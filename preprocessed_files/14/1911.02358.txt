gdm 1 introduction from felix klein in go ttingen by responding to your earnest request to contribute to the journal s book dedicated to the memory of dirichlet i refer to a note i published six years ago in the rendiconti dell accademia dei lincei 9 and in which i outlined a general solution of equations of sixth degree i set myself the goal of explaining in more detail and in more concrete terms what was suggested there in fact even an expert of the relevant literature such as mr lachtin has not taken the approach in question in its simplicity as i will explain more below 1 moreover i act under the impulses of my old friend mr gordan who has recently turned his great algebraic ability to the problem in question mr gor dan will soon publish a first relevant treatise in the math annalen 7 2 but this is only a beginning i hope that his continued efforts will succeed in clarify ing the subject in every respect as fully as we have been able to do in the past with the theory of equations of the fifth degree i would like to discuss this theory of the equations of the fifth degree in advance as i summarized them in my lectures on the icosahedron 13 in such a way that i bring forth those moments which are generalized when dealing with the considerations of the sixth degree in chapter v of these lectures i have dealt with two methods for solving equations of the fifth degree which incidentally differ only by the order in which the steps are carried out and the second of these methods will prove to be the natural continuation of kronecker s and brioschi s method this method like the first one is developed in ge ometric form with special relations that emerge only in equations of the fifth degree instead i refer here to the algebraic justification developed in volume 15 of the math annalen 11 and accompanied with reflections on the solution of arbitrary higher equations 3 the icosahedral theory of the equations of the fifth degree and the general considerations connected with it have since been portrayed several times by others especially in the second volume of the excellent textbook on algebra by mr weber 19 as well as in the detailed report that mr wiman has made 11901 moscow mathematical collection vol xxli pp 181 218 russian 2 a contribution to the solution of the general equations of the sixth degree compare with a message to the heidelberg international congress of mathematics 3 in particular see section 4 the formulas of kronecker and brioschi for the fifth degree 2 in volume i of the encyclopedia of mathematical sciences 22 nevertheless it seems that the basic meaning of the whole approach in the mathematical audience is still often not understood it is not a matter of considerations which are to the sides of the earlier investigations on the solution of equations of the fifth degree but of those which claim to constitute the very core of these earlier investigations accordingly in the following report i will try to describe the main points of the theory which will later be found mutatis mutandis in the approach to the equations of the sixth degree as accurately as possible while maintaining brevity the first is that we have the icosahedral equation i e the equation of the sixtieth degree which is written in the above lectures as follows h 3 x 1728 f 5 x x 1 as a normalgleichung sui generis normal general equation which by virtue of their excellent qualities is the next generalization of the pure equations x n x 2 in fact given any root of 1 the 60 roots of 1 can be calculated by the 60 linear equations that are already known the icosahedral substitutions just as the n roots of 2 can be found from any one of them by the n substitutions given by x e 2 ik n x now the group of icosahedral substitutions proves to be isomorphic with the group of 60 alternating permutations on five letters i e a 5 in this way it is impossible to trace the solution of the general equations of the fifth degree back to a sequence of pure equations 2 the task is thus to solve the equations of the fifth degree with the help of an icosahedral equation here we distinguish an algebraic and a transcendental part of the investigation the first part will deal with the algebraic construction of a root x of an icosahe dral equation 1 from the roots z 1 z 5 of a given fifth degree equation the parameter x of 1 is determined by the coefficients of the fifth degree equa tion we first calculate the square root of the discriminant of the fifth degree equation in terms of the z 1 z 5 the transcendental part is to calculate the root x of the icosahedral equation from the parameter x by infinite processes this is due to the hypergeometric series as well as the transcendental solution of equation 2 by the binomial series in the lectures on the icosahedron it has been shown in particular that all algebraic investigations which have been made for the purpose of solving the general equations of the fifth degree are reenactments of the aforementioned algebraic problem the transcendental part of the task is only barely touched it is clearly stated however what the connection is with the so called solution of the equations of the fifth degree by elliptic functions i refer here to my other detailed explanations in the lec tures on the theory of elliptic modular functions 14 edited by fricke and myself there is a necessary connection between the fifth order transformation of the elliptic functions and the theory of the icosahedron in 1 substituting 3 j the absolute invariant of an elliptic modular function for x the variable x gets the meaning of the principal modular function of the principal congruence group of the fifth degree 4 all modes of relating the solution of the fifth degree equations to the elliptic functions are based on this fundamental theorem in particular x can be rep resented by elliptic theta functions it is a formula of principled simplicity you have if i may use jacobi notation for the sake of brevity x q 2 5 1 2 ik k q 5 1 ik k q 5 3 however the use of this formula to solve the icosahedral equation or similar formulas for solving any resolvents of the icosahedral equation is just as much a detour as the solution of the pure equation 2 by logarithms x e 1 n log x 4 you have to first calculate k k respectively by calculating log x from x be fore applying formulas 3 4 the meaning of the formulas for the solution is at most a practical one namely if one has a logarithm table of elliptic periods k k thus we can finally realize that the use of elliptic functions is not the essence of the theory of equations of the fifth degree this mode of expression via elliptic functions is only a residue of accidental historical development the transformation theory of functions has given the first approach to establishing certain simple equations closely related to the icosahedral equation namely the modular equations and multiplier equations for the fifth degree transformation so much for the introduction of the icosahedron into the theory of the fifth degree in general i now have to limit myself to the algebraic side of the task and here above all else i have to mention a fundamental proposition about the icosahedral substitutions which becomes particularly important in what follows one can pass from the icosahedral substitutions of the variable x appearing in 1 to homogeneous substitution formulas by replacing x in the substitution formulas everywhere by x 1 x 2 and separating numerator and denominator in an appropriate manner if one chooses the determinant of the resulting binary substitutions equal to 1 one has 120 binary substitutions specifically the identity substitution x x corresponds to the two homogeneous substitution formulas x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 and x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 5 it is not possible in any way even if you change the value of the determinant to assemble from such homogeneous substitutions a group which is isomorphic 4 translator s note the terms principal congruence sub group of the fifth degree of the modular group and principal modular function are defined in 14 see pages 388 and 591 in the original german books or pages 323 and 475 in the english translation 4 with the non homogeneous substitution group which contains fewer than 120 substitutions the surjective homomorphism from the substitution group of the x 1 x 2 to the substitution group of the x therefore has a non trivial kernel this fundamental proposition which is somewhat abstract gives the algebraic theory of equations of the fifth degree its peculiar form as we shall have to explain at once let us note in advance that it is not difficult to prove it on pages 46 and 47 of my book on the icosahedron it is traced back to the fact that the group of non homogeneous icosahedral substitutions contains the klein four group and the corresponding proposition already applies to the klein four group let us take the following to be the simplest representation of the klein four group as non homogeneous substitutions it is given by i ii iii 1 iv 1 6 here ii iii and iv are substitutions of order 2 and at the same time ii iii iv i 7 if one now wishes to create an isomorphic group of homogeneous substitutions one certainly has a group with i 1 1 2 2 and replacing ii iii and iv by ii 1 1 2 2 iii 1 2 2 1 iv 1 2 2 1 where in the individual horizontal rows the upper or lower signs are to be taken as desired but as one must also choose the signs here the substitutions ii iii and iv each have determinant 1 and thus it is impossible that ii iii iv i however this contradicts 7 and no such isomorphism can exist from now on we will understand the homogeneous icosahedral substitutions as the 120 binary substitutions with determinant 1 corresponding to the 60 non homogeneous substitutions of x 5 i will now formulate the central problem for which we are responsible from the five independent variables z 1 z 5 the roots of the equation of the fifth degree one has to compose a function x z 1 z 5 which gives an isomorphism from the 60 icosahedral substitutions to the 60 even permutations of z 1 z 5 from our fundamental proposition it immediately follows that there is no such rational function of the five free variables lectures on the theory of elliptic modular functions 14 p 255 namely by dividing x into coprime polynomials corresponding to the numerator and denominator i e writing x z 1 z 5 z 1 z 5 z 1 z 5 with and coprime the thus introduced would necessarily be homo geneously linear in the 60 permutations of the z 1 z 5 these homogeneous substitutions would correspond individually to the icosahedral substitutions of x so one would have a group of binary homogeneous substitutions that is isomorphic with the group of inhomogeneous icosahedral substitutions and such an isomorphism does not exist as we have seen previously the required function x z 1 z 5 must therefore depend on its argument algebraically 5 with this we are led into the domain of those irrationalities of the theory of equations which i call accessory in my lectures 13 p 158 159 because they are added as something new to the immediately existing irrational ities of the rational functions of the z 1 z 5 6 the usual galois theory of equations can only deal with the immediately existing irrationalities and not the accessory irrationalities as usually happens when something new comes forward we do not know anything about the efficacy of these accessory irrationalities in general rather we are dependent on tentative experiments in individual cases certainly in the solution of any higher equation the only allowable accessory irrationalities are those calculated from the symmetric functions of the roots possibly the predetermined rational functions by means of lower equations 7 in the equations of the fifth degree which we treat here the symmetric functions of the z 1 z 5 and its difference product the square root of its discriminant are known 5 translator s note in particular this dependence is not rational 6 translator s note we refer to these in modern language as natural irrationalities 7 translator s note this is klein s statement of resolvent degree 6 we can successfully construct in many ways one of the icosahedrally dependent x z 1 z 5 as soon as we adjoin the square root of a suitable rational function of the z 1 z 5 8 the two methods of solving equations of the fifth degree which i give in my lectures differ only by where they adjoin this accessory square root in the first method the accessory square root transforming the fifth degree equation by a tschirnhaus transformation into a so called fifth de gree principal equation that is an equation in which the sum of the roots and the sum of the square roots vanishes comes first in the second method we first take a step towards the icosahedral problem and then adjoin the accessory square root as we said in the introduction i give preference to the second method here by introducing its individual steps in such a way that the whole approach can analogously be transferred to the sixth degree here in numbered order are the main considerations of the second method 1 when x 1 x 2 undergo the 120 homogeneous binary icosahedral substitu tions the squares and the product x 21 x 1 x 2 x 2 2 undergo only 60 homogeneous ternary substitutions of determinant 1 whose group is isomorphic to the 60 non homogeneous icosahedral substitutions of x 1 x 2 and thus to the 60 even permutations of the five quantities z 1 z 5 2 the same is true according to the general principles of invariant theory of the coefficients of the quadratic binary form of x 1 x 2 in order to have an immediate connection to the style of kronecker and brioschi also used in my lectures i shall hereby designate such a form as follows a 1 x 2 1 2 a 0 x 1 x 2 a 2 x 22 8 the a 1 2 a 0 a 2 depend contragrediently on x 2 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 2 according to the notions of invariant theory 9 3 we readily conclude that it is possible to form from any given five vari ables z 1 z 5 rational functions such that the alternating permutations of the z 1 z 5 also permute the a 0 a 1 a 2 in fact in the work already mentioned in the introduction to vol 15 of the math annalen i have given a general approach which implies that whenever two given sets of 8 the fifth root of unity e 2 i 5 occurs in the icosahedral substitutions and will be useful in the construction of a suitable function x if we count the accessory irrationalities rigorously then one has accessory irrationalities in the theory of equations from the beginning namely in the reduction of the cyclic equations to pure equations 9 translator s note recall that given a group g and linear g representations v and w a w valued contragredient of v is a g equivariant regular map a v a w 7 variables here the z 1 z 5 and the a 0 a 1 a 2 undergo isomorphic ho mogeneous linear substitutions we can simply construct rational functions from which we can translate the first set of variables like the z 1 z 5 into the second set like the a 0 a 1 a 2 4 we do not reproduce the general approach here which would be unnec essarily lengthy but instead give the abbreviated form relevant to our particular problem which deals directly with the developments of kro necker and brioschi on equations of fifth degree 1 these are the following points a we form six quadratic expressions in x 1 x 2 5 x 1 x 2 x 21 x 1 x 2 4 x 22 where e 2 i 5 0 4 9 which are permuted when x 1 x 2 undergo the icosahedral substitu tions b further let v z 1 z 5 be a rational function of z 1 z 5 which remains invariant by the cyclic permutation of z 1 z 5 taken in natural order we form the difference v z 1 z 5 v z 5 z 1 and square it then we have a metacyclic function 10 which should be called u 2 while the five other values that result from it by the alternating permutations of z 1 z 5 may be labeled u 2 in a proper order 0 1 2 3 4 one can then choose the signs of the u u 0 u 4 such that the alternating permutations of the z 1 z 5 permute the u u 0 u 4 10 isomorphically by the corresponding icosahedral substitutions of x 1 x 2 namely they undergo the same sign changes as 9 c we conclude that the following form z 1 z 5 x 1 x 2 5 u x 1 x 2 4 0 u x 2 1 x 1 x 2 4 x 22 11 remains invariant if one simultaneously applies an alternating per mutation to the z 1 z 5 and the corresponding icosahedral substi tution to the x 1 x 2 10 translator s note this means that the corresponding stabilizer is a metacyclic group recall that a group is metacyclic if it is an extension of a cyclic group by a cyclic group in this case the corresponding stabilizer is d 10 the dihedral group with 10 elements which is indeed metacyclic 8 d we now put in accordance with 8 z 1 z 5 x 1 x 2 a 1 x 21 2 a 0 x 1 x 2 a 2 x 22 and find by comparison 2 a 0 5 u 4 0 u a 1 4 0 u a 2 4 0 4 u 12 thus we have constructed from z 1 z 5 the quantities a 0 a 1 a 2 which are permuted in the desired way when the z 1 z 5 undergo an alternating permutation 5 we refer to the above result by saying that we have assigned a covariant quadratic binary form 8 to the z 1 z 5 11 the discriminant of 8 is a a 20 a 1 a 2 13 which is a binary function of z 1 z 5 that is invariant under alternating permutations of z 1 z 5 it is thus a rational function of the coefficients of the given fifth degree equation and the square root of its discriminant the goal is not to assign to z 1 z 5 a covariant binary quadratic form or a pair of points of the binary form a 1 x 2 1 2 a 0 x 1 x 2 a 2 x 22 0 14 but to assign a quotient x 1 x 2 i e a point we do this in the simplest way by solving the quadratic equation 14 and accordingly writing x 1 x 2 x a 0 a 20 a 1 a 2 a 1 15 6 thus we have solved our central task to compose such an x from the z 1 z 5 which undergoes the icosahedral substitutions corresponding to the alternating permutations of the z 1 z 5 note that the a 0 a 1 a 2 of item 4 d are rational functions of z 1 z 5 and their construction uses only one irrationality the fifth root of unity according to item 5 we see that the expression of a 0 a 1 a 2 under the square root 12 is invariant under alternating permutations of the z 1 z 5 we have thus achieved the goal with the aid of such accessory irrationalities which in the theory of the fifth degree will suitably be called lower irrationalities 11 translator s note given a group g and linear g representations v and w a w valued covariant of v is a g equivariant regular map a v a w 12 translator s note e g the a 2 0 a 1 a 2 in equation 15 9 7 we now further investigate the parameter x of the icosahedral equation which satisfies our x 15 as a function of the coefficients of the equation of the fifth degree whose roots are the z 1 z 5 respectively we will say that the equation is solved if we calculate the square root of the dis criminant and how the z 1 z 5 are rationally represented by x from the coefficients of the equation of the fifth degree and the adjoined square root i e we do not concern ourselves with the transcendental portion 8 in summary let us emphasize why one can justifiably speak of such a solution of equations of the fifth degree not only is there a sequence of steps that could be numerically traversed in the given case so that one actually obtains the numerical values of z 1 z 5 but it is also a full theo retical insight into the internal nature of the problem of solution 13 after all the z 1 z 5 are the different branches of a finite valued algebraic function which depends on the coefficients of the fifth degree equation and is initially of a very confusing design these five branches z 1 z 5 are defined over the field of rationality determined by the icosahedral ir rationality 14 the field of rationality is given by the coefficients of the fifth degree equation the square root of the discriminant and the adjoined accessory irrationalities the icosahedral irrationality is of a more trans parent construction and is a higher irrationality that depends only on a single parameter from the field of rationality i would like to take up at this point a more personal remark about the re lationship between my papers on the equations of the fifth degree and those of kronecker as you dear colleague are in the position of being able to see the manuscripts of kronecker and thus can complete my information in an authen tic way as is well known kronecker and brioschi 1 used the same quantities a 0 a 1 a 2 in their first papers on equations of the fifth degree from 1858 which i quoted earlier in list item 4 b they then constructed the sixth degree equation satisfying 5 a 20 and which brioschi calls a jacobi equation be cause of its close connection with certain equations established by jacobi for the transformation of elliptic functions finally they state that by adjoining a root one can arrive at an equation with only one parameter this square root defines an accessory irrationality equivalent to that used in formula 15 fur thermore kronecker 15 set up the fundamental theorem which i designate as kronecker s theorem in my lectures moreover the exposition and proof of kronecker s theorem are the crowning achievement of my lectures the theorem is that it is impossible to form a resolvent to the general equation of the fifth 13 translator s note by problem of solution klein means the problem of solving generic polynomials 14 translator s note for more on fields of rationality see ackerman s english translation of development of mathematics in the 19 th century by felix klein in particular see chapter vii deeper insight into the nature of algebraic varieties and structures section 3 the theory of algebraic integers and its interaction with the theory of algebraic functions p 312 314 10 degree with only one parameter and without resorting to accessory irrationali ties as in the 12 th volume of the math annalen 10 i prove this proposition by invoking the property of the icosahedral group discussed above namely the doubling at least of its substitutions in the transition to homogeneous sub stitutions my first proof which i gave in 1877 in the reports of the erlangen physical medical school meeting of january 13 was considerably more com plicated twenty four years ago easter 1881 i had the opportunity to talk in detail with kronecker about these things it turned out that in his inves tigations kronecker was unaware of the icosahedral substitutions to which he had come so close and accordingly did not have sufficient proof for his main claim i think this is a very remarkable fact but also very common for it con firms in a particularly interesting case what gauss so often emphasizes that the discovery of the most important mathematical theorems is more a matter of intuition than of deduction and the production of the proof is a very different business from the discovery of the theorems i did not return to the subject later with kronecker but some years ago i heard that after the publication of my lectures in a college kronecker has commented on the solution of the fifth degree equations and the theory of the icosahedron i would be very interested as certainly would other mathematicians in finding out what may be contained in kronecker s papers on these matters and i would like to ask you to review the relevant material and publish it soon a new proof of kronecker s theorem has been given by mr gordan in vol ume 29 of the math annalen 6 15 it is easier to read than mine in that it does not refer to an explicit knowledge of the icosahedral substitutions any where nevertheless as i shall point out it is most closely related to the basic idea of my proof following a development by mr lu roth 18 we both use a proposition which can be formulated as follows 16 suppose an equation of nth degree whose roots are the independent vari ables z 1 zn has a rational resolvent with only one parameter then the n th degree equation must have a rational function x of the z 1 zn such that when the z 1 zn are permuted by the galois group x undergoes a linear transfor mation we have the same understanding that when changing to homogeneous coordinates x 1 x 2 we must go from our group of linear substitutions to an isomorphic groups of homogeneous linear substitutions on the other hand of course this group must be isomorphic to the galois group of the equation mod ulo a specified subgroup 15 compare this with the presentation of gordan s proof in the textbook of weber and netto s algebra 16 translator s note the theorem of lu roth that klein and kronecker use can be stated as follows let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 then any unirational function field of transcendence degree 1 is isomorphic to k t where t is transcendental over k 11 now on p 44 47 of my lectures i have given the proposition that only the following groups of linear substitutions of a single variable can be converted isomorphically to their corresponding binary forms 1 the cyclic groups 2 the dihedral groups of odd n it follows that an equation of the nth degree whose roots are the independent variables z 1 zn only admits a rational resolvent with only one parameter which can be immediately transformed into a pure equation or dihedral equa tion of odd n if its galois group is isomorphic to a normal subgroup of a cyclic group or a dihedral group of odd n 17 an associated resolvent with only one parameter can then be set up immediately according to the principles in the math annalen vol 15 11 the general statement above is included in both gordan s proof and my proof of kronecker s theorem indeed my proof is done by pointing out that the group of a fifth degree equation with the square root of the discriminant adjoined is simple however it is isomorphic to the group of linear substitutions of the icosahedron and thus the previous theorem yields the claim gordan s proof on the other hand if i understand it correctly uses the obvious fact that the group in question like every group contains itself as a normal subgroup the quotient of the group by itself is isomorphic to the identity group and the identical substitution falls under the premise of our theorem thus there are in fact resolvents with one parameter but they are completely useless for the solution of the equations of the fifth degree namely there are linear resolvents whose square root is a function of the z 1 z 5 that is invariant under the alternating permutations of the z 1 z 5 but there are no other rational resolvents with just one parameter or better every ratio nal resolvent of our fifth degree equation with just one parameter is linear and therefore useless so much for the icosahedral substitutions and the solution of fifth degree equations mediated by them instead of the unitary substitutions x e 2 ik n which link the roots of a pure equation to one another binary linear substi tutions of two homogeneous variables x 1 x 2 have entered at the same time the way to new generalizations has opened up one simply has to use groups of linear substitutions of several homogeneous variables i cannot possibly repeat here the reflections which i gave in this regard first in the 15 th volume of the math annalen 11 or recall the elaborations which have later been concluded it suffices to refer to weber s textbook 19 and to the already cited encyclo pedia article by wiman 22 18 in this sequence we consider an equation of sixth degree along with the square root of its discriminant whose galois group consists of the 360 alternating permutations of the roots z 1 z 6 it will be 17 translator s note in modern language this is the classification of groups of essential dimension 1 18 a first clear introduction is also the lecture ix of my evanston colloquium held at the world s fair in chicago macmillan new york 1894 12 necessary to use the smallest number of homogeneous x 1 x for which there exists a surjective homomorphism from the group of linear substitutions of the x 1 x to the group of the 360 alternating permutations if this surjective homomorphism were to prove to be an isomorphism we would be able to write down rational functions of z 1 z 6 according to the prescriptions of 11 which are linear in the 360 alternating permutations of z 1 z 6 and yield x 1 x as a result however it turns out that here as in the equations of the fifth degree the homomorphism must have a non trivial kernel so that we are asked the question whether or respectively how we can get by with the help of lower accessory irrationalities my first approach to the formulation of this question is in volume 28 of the math annalen 1886 on the theory of general equations of the sixth and seventh degrees 19 12 at the time it seemed like the preliminary work of mr c jordan would not allow a ternary group of linear substitutions with the requisite surjective homomorphism to the group of the 360 alternating permu tations on six letters such a group was first discovered by mr valentiner in 1889 volume 6 of series v of the danish academy s papers the definitions of the final transformation groups 20 and examined by structural and re lated fundamental invariants for the first time by mr wiman in 1895 20 math annalen 47 about the simple group of 360 plane collineations 21 at that time i constructed a group of quarternary collineations that is isomorphic to the group for the general equation of degree six and also for the general equation of degree seven and showed that the original problems rest on the corresponding problems for the groups of quarternary collineations which can be obtained from the general equations of degree six respectively seven with at most two accessory square roots 21 as far as the equations of the sixth degree are concerned to which we confine ourselves here this approach is currently unnecessary because of the discov ery of the valentiner group 22 i note this expressly because this is where mr lachtin makes an unnecessary detour as mentioned at the beginning of this letter in order to connect the equation of degree six with the valentiner group mr lachtin goes through the development given in volume 28 of the 19 translator s note klein gives the correct volume for the article but the incorrect year this article is from december 1887 in issue 4 of volume 28 20 translator s note while klein gives the correct volume this work was actually published in december of 1896 21 the group which i put forward for the sixth degree equation contains as many as 720 collineations so that it is not necessary to use all of them adjoin the square root of the discriminant of the sixth degree equation beforehand in contrast the group corresponding to the equations of the seventh degree contains only 7 2 2520 collineations 22 for the equations of seventh degree the quaternary approach persists but it is impossible to pursue the interesting questions in this text 13 math annalen 23 16 this is not uninteresting 24 but is by no means necessary for what we do next the transition from the equations of the sixth degree to the valentiner group as i suggested in my roman note of 1899 and which i now wish to introduce in more detail does not require any reference to the quarternary substitution group for the sake of clarity i shall again divide the considerations in question into a numbered list below which makes clear the analogy with the train of thought followed for the equations of the fifth degree 1 the task is to compose three functions x 1 x 2 x 3 from the six free variables z 1 z 6 such that the homogeneous x 1 x 2 x 3 undergo the correspond ing collineations of the valentiner group when the z 1 z 6 undergo one of the 360 alternating permutations 2 now mr wiman has already noticed that the number of collineations from the valentiner group at least triples when one goes from substitutions of the plane to the corresponding ternary linear substitutions therefore it is not possible for the required x 1 x 2 x 3 to be rational functions of z 1 z 6 3 from now on we want to fix the homogeneous linear valentiner substi tutions so that their determinant is always 1 thus there are exactly 3 360 1080 of them and the three substitutions corresponding to the identity substitution of the plane are x 1 j x 1 x 2 j x 2 x 3 j x 3 j e 2 i 3 0 2 16 4 we now note that in these 1080 homogeneous substitutions the ten degree three terms coming from the x 1 x 2 x 3 are x 31 x 2 1 x 2 23 translator s note lachtin only has two articles in the mathematische annalen the one klein is referring to from september 1898 in issue 3 of volume 51 lachtin s other article is on the septic and is from september 1902 in issue 3 of volume 56 24 mr lachtin notes that in the quaternary group the degree two surfaces in space in terchange in much the same way as the degree three curves of the plane from here as is noted in passing it is possible without any great difficulty to arrive at the same which i communicate below under 19 one only has to keep in mind that the roots z 1 z 6 of the sixth degree equation and also their squares z 2 1 z 2 6 define a linear complex in space according to the developments of volume 28 and that these two complexes together with the unitary complex introduced there determine a degree two surface through their common lines no accessory irrationality occurs here it is then in no way necessary in the transition from space to plane to refer to the comparatively complicated formulas as mr lachtin does by which in volume 28 i have assigned a point of space to the roots z 1 z 6 so also in this regard the approach of mr lachtin can be shortened 14 which only undergo 360 homogeneous linear substitutions and whose group will be isomorphic with the group of alternating permutations of z 1 z 6 5 we now consider any cubic ternary form a 1 1 1 x 3 1 3 a 1 1 2 x 2 1 x 2 which if set equal to 0 represents a degree three curve in the plane of x 1 x 2 x 3 the coefficients a 1 1 1 3 a 1 1 2 for any homogeneous linear substitutions of x 1 x 2 x 3 are related to the x 3 1 x 2 1 x 2 contravariantly thus in the substitutions of the valentiner group they also undergo ex actly 360 homogeneous linear substitutions which can be uniquely iden tified with the 360 alternating permutations of z 1 z 6 6 we readily conclude that it is possible to form ten rational functions of the free variables z 1 z 6 denoted by 1 1 1 1 1 2 which in the case of the alternating substitutions of the z 1 z 6 are substituted just as the a 1 1 1 a 1 1 2 are by the corresponding substitutions of the valentiner group i e the roots z 1 z 6 rationally and covariantly assign a degree three curve 7 to put it another way one can construct in many different ways and without the use of accessory irrationalities 25 a cubic form depending on the z 1 z 6 and x 1 x 2 x 3 z 1 z 6 x 1 x 2 x 3 1 1 1 x 31 3 1 1 2 x 21 x 2 17 which remains invariant if one simultaneously performs an alternating permutation on the z 1 z 6 and its corresponding valentiner substitution on the x 1 x 2 x 3 8 as far as the actual construction of such a form is concerned i do not give the general and extensive process which i provided in 11 but develop it in an abbreviated manner that emerged from my correspondence with mr gordan last winter just as with equations of the fifth degree one has to combine the following relationships 25 apart of course from the numerical irrationalities that occur in the substitutions of the valentiner group these are in accordance with the following formulas 18 etc the square roots 3 and 5 15 a the 360 collineations of the valentiner group play an important role in two systems of six conic sections as mr wiman proved first the six conic sections of each of the two systems are permuted by the corresponding 360 collineations in 360 ways b the equations of these 2 6 12 conic sections were first proposed by mr gerbaldi 5 rendiconti del circolo matematico di palermo t xii 1898 sul gruppo semplice di 360 collineazioni piane i already published in 1882 in the atti di torino vol xv p 358 ff note sui gruppi di sei coniche in involuzione 26 here we equate the corresponding ternary quadratic forms of determinant 1 by restricting to the one system of six conic sections according to the procedure of mr gordan we can then write 27 k 1 x 2 1 jx 2 2 j 2 x 23 k 2 x 2 1 j 2 x 22 jx 2 3 k 3 x 21 x 2 2 x 2 3 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 1 x 1 x 2 k 4 x 21 x 2 2 x 2 3 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 1 x 1 x 2 k 5 x 21 x 2 2 x 2 3 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 1 x 1 x 2 k 6 x 21 x 2 2 x 2 3 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 1 x 1 x 2 18 where 1 15 8 and 3 15 4 c the k 1 k 6 are determined up to a third root of unity by the requirement that their determinant be 1 in fact the 1080 valen tiner substitutions permute the k 1 k 6 by multiplication by cer tain third roots of unity d we want now from any three of the k k k k one whose coefficients form a trilinear covariant and a similar invari ant for the former we choose the functional determinant k k k which changes its sign when two of the k k k are exchanged as an invariant we take a symmetric combination of the coefficients of the k k k namely the expression used in the development of the coefficient determinant of the form k k k in which appears i will temporarily call it k k k here this is a simple numerical quantity in the present case e for all possible triples k k k we now form the quotient k k k k k k 26 translator s note the modern reference for this article is the one appearing in the mathematische annalen which is what we give thus we have left the two previous journal references klein gave in the main text 27 translator s note as in equation 16 j is the primitive 3 rd root of unit e 2 i 3 16 one can show that the 6 3 20 quotients obtained above undergo the same sign changes from the 1080 substitutions of the valentiner groups that the 20 difference products z z z z z z undergo from the corresponding alternating permutations of the z 1 z 6 f therefore the sum of all triples z z z z z z k k k k k k 19 is a simple example of a form z 1 z 6 x 1 x 2 x 3 as we were looking for in item number 7 above g more general examples which we do not need in the following are obtained by substituting the determinant z z z z z z z z z for the difference product of z z z in 19 h let us now assign the sum 19 to the successive terms x 31 x 2 1 x 2 by writing as in formula 17 z z z z z z k k k k k k 1 1 1 x 3 1 3 1 1 2 x 2 1 x 2 20 so that the 1 1 1 1 1 2 are just such the rational functions of z 1 z 6 that we looked for in item number 6 above 9 the degree three curve z z z z z z k k k k k k 0 21 whose coefficients depend rationally on the z 1 z 6 covariantly assigns a point x 1 x 2 x 3 using accessory irrationalities that are as low as possible 10 the theory of degree three plane curves offers various possibilities for the sake of brevity as i did in my roman note i want to choose an inflection point in third order curve here 17 11 according to the well known theory of hesse the determination of such an inflection point requires only square roots and cube roots for the solution of the equations of the sixth degree these are indeed lower irrationalities the details of the process of determining an inflection point are not discussed here 12 on the other hand the inflection point is certainly connected in a covariant manner with the degree three curve if any collineation is performed on a curve with a chosen inflection point p then p is taken to an inflection point p on the new curve and each of the nine inflection points can be realized in this manner in particular this applies to the 360 collineations of the valentiner group 13 we now think of the coordinates x 1 x 2 x 3 of our chosen inflection point instead of the coefficients 1 1 1 1 1 2 of the curve of third order whose values come from 20 and the z 1 z 6 14 if the z 1 z 6 undergo an alternating permutation the x 1 x 2 x 3 un dergo the corresponding collineation of the valentiner group we conclude that the rational functions of z 1 z 6 that remain invariant after the reductions in the expressions of x 1 x 2 x 3 from the occurring square roots and cubic roots also remain invariant under the alternating permutations of the z 1 z 6 thus they can be represented as rational functions of the coefficients of the presented sixth degree equation and the square root of their discriminant 15 therefore we will are justified in designating the irrationalities required in the calculation of the inflection point as lower accessory irrationalities 16 by computing the coordinates x 1 x 2 x 3 of an inflection point of our c 3 our degree three curve we have accomplished the goal we form the functions x 1 x 2 x 3 from the free variables z 1 z 6 and lower accessory irrationalities such that when the the z 1 z 6 undergo an alternating permutation the x 1 x 2 x 3 undergo the corresponding collineation of the valentiner group this is the explanation of the particular content of my roman note which i thought to give here 28 one might wish for a closer examination of the inference used in list item number 14 the simplest thing would be to calculate all the known equations leading to the determination of an inflection point of the degree three curve 21 28 the final sentence of the note has become incomprehensible when printed in the rendiconti of the accademia dei lincei by a strange change it should read and with the aid of accessory irrationalities which we usually regard as elementary we come to the goal instead what is printed is and so with the aid of ancillary irrationalities we come to the goal which usually regarded as elementary 18 and thus actually confirm the assertion moreover as mr gordan remarks the whole of the conclusion can be dealt with in the following way just consider the ninth degree equation which satisfies the nine values that an absolute invariant of the valentiner group e g the to be named immediately assumes in the nine inflection points this equation must be the same for all 360 third order curves which results from the substitutions of the valentiner group and thus by the alternating substitutions of the two after disposing of indifferent factors the coefficients are rational functions of the z 1 z 6 that are invariant under the alternating permutations of the z 1 z 6 the affect of this ninth degree equation can be none other than that of the original inflection point equation it is thus solved by square roots and cubic roots of rational functions of z 1 z 6 that are invariant under the alternating permutations of z 1 z 6 now if we adjoin one of the resulting nine values of our absolute invariant then it and the equation 21 of the third order curve respectively of the equation of its hessian curve becomes the corresponding single inflection point x 1 x 2 x 3 and is calculated rationally consequently the assertion of list item number 14 concerning the irrationalities required in the calculation of the inflection point is self evident the further treatment of equations of the sixth degree will have to be done in any case by calculating the absolute invariants of the valentiner group of the selected inflection point of our third order curve according to mr wiman the valentiner group has three lowest invariants f h 22 of degrees 6 12 and 30 in the x 1 x 2 x 3 from them the two fundamental absolute invariants come together which i call v and w here in connection with the work of mr lachtin to be mentioned immediately v f 3 w h f 2 23 if we enter the coordinates of our point of inflection for x 1 x 2 x 3 then the v w are rational functions of the coefficients of the sixth degree equation and the square root of the discriminant respectively the occasionally introduced accessory irrationalities the normalproblem 29 of solving equations of the sixth degree is thus the reduction to calculating x 1 x 2 x 3 from the known v w as just stated this is now a problem with two arbitrary parameters and is distinguished by the fact that all of its 360 solutions x 1 x 2 x 3 can be determined from a given solution by the 360 collineations of the valentiner group we do not currently have a method to reduce the number of parameters to one by means of further lower irrationalities for example if we try to assign a point x 1 x 2 x 3 to the degree six curve f 0 in a covariant manner and 29 in german this was indeed one word normalproblem 19 thus set the following instead of the normalproblem 23 to the inflection point x 1 x 2 x 3 f 0 t 2 h 5 24 in the usual approach intersection of the curve f 0 with a straight line co variantly dependent on the point x 1 x 2 x 3 one encounters an auxiliary equation which itself is of the sixth degree for the sake of completeness we finally ask for a reverse form i e to ra tionally calculate the quantities assumed to be known v w from the roots z 1 z 6 of the presented sixth order equation and a single solution system x 1 x 2 x 3 of 23 thus we have completely sketched the algebraic part of the solution of the equations of the sixth degree the transcendental part will require infinite processes to actually compute the x 1 x 2 x 3 from the equations 23 a first approach to this is done by mr lachtin in a voluminuous work which was first published in russian 1901 in the 22 nd volume of the moscow mathematics collection and then in 1902 in the german edition of volume 56 of the math annalen 17 30 writing y 1 x 1 6 f y 2 x 2 6 f y 3 x 3 6 f 25 the y 1 y 2 y 3 are a system of solutions to the three simultaneous linear partial differential equations expressing the second derivatives 2 y v 2 2 y v w 2 y w 2 linearly in the y v and y w and the y mr lachtin has shown that the coef ficients of these equations are rational functions of the absolute invariants v w which do not exceed certain definable degrees however he did not calculate the numerical coefficients of these polynomials the remaining gap is now being filled by the work of mr gordan which i referred to in the beginning of this letter 31 in fact mr gordan succeeded in making explicit the partial differen tial equations in question it is thus possible to develop the y 1 y 2 y 3 in powers of v and w or even in any series of linear functions of v and linear functions of w thus it is no longer an issue to determine the regions in which the various series thus formed converge in other words we can solve the transcendental problem in a direct way 30 the differential resolvent of an algebraic equation of the sixth degree of a general kind math ann vol 56 p 445 481 31 we believe that klein is referring to the work that became 7 20 again for the sake of completeness it must be added that the special prob lem presented by equation 24 is already discussed in detail in terms of function theory in 1896 at the frankfurter scientific congress mr fricke 32 dealt with the decomposition of the riemann surface of genus 10 corresponding to the valentiner group into fundamental domains and a closed relation of the same with the decomposition of the half plane in the semicircular triangles from the angles 2 4 5 mr lachtin then confirms this information in 16 and established the third order linear differential equation for which in the case of equations 24 the parameter t is satisfied by the variables x multiplied by a suitable factor i am at the end of my presentation i hope the analogy of the proposed sixth degree equations with the solution of the equations of the fifth degree by the icosahedral equation appears convincing a finer examination of the de tails given by mr gordan and myself for the equations of the fifth degree as well as a geometric presentation are given in my lectures on the icosahedron go ttingen march 22 1905 32 translator s note for more information see 4 21 2 ending footnote mr gordan has been able to devote only one introductory essay to the questions raised above 8 there he makes a substantial simplification of the necessary accessory irrationality of x 1 x 2 x 3 instead of the degree three curve of the x 1 x 2 x 3 plane which i rationally assigned to the value system z 1 z 6 it uses a 1 1 connection i e a bilinear form in the x and u whose coefficients must be assumed to be whole rational functions of z 1 z 6 and that the form remains invariant under the 360 permutations of the z 1 z 6 and the corre sponding linear substitutions of the x and u then to find a covariant point x 1 x 2 x 3 for one of the permutations of the z 1 z 6 one only has to determine one more root of an easy cubic equation namely to go to a fixed point of the connection in particular gordan succeeds in setting up a linear form of the desired kind which is of degree 6 in the z 1 z 6 in the meantime mr coble showed by a systematic process that one need only go to the fourth degree 3 he sets up the associated cubic equation and then further sketches the course of the required algebraic calculation to determine the z 1 z 6 k i will conclude by mentioning the explanations given on p 491 footnote 10 referring to kronecker s theorem first of all for the sake of completeness a few hints about my original proof of january 1877 at that time i had operated on the fact that all icosahedral forms and also the tetrahedral form have a direct degree the circumstance is of course in turn a consequence of the doubling of the number of homogeneous substitutions which i have emphasized in abh liv which was the actual rea son for the proof incidentally i must go into more detail about the reference between kro necker and myself from easter 1881 see p 10 at that time i asked kronecker for a manuscript from 1861 from which i could copy the part that was suitable for me the copy bears the date of march 23 in the proof of his theorem kronecker uses it exactly as i did later by anticipating lu roth s theorem on rational curves 18 and from there on the task is to form a rational function out of five free variables x 0 x 4 which is a linear transformation in the 60 alternating permutations of the x 0 x 4 he then encounters a strange lapse since kronecker had not yet familiarized himself with the general notion of a group of linear substitutions of one variable he erroneously concludes that the 60 linear transformations in question ought to arise from the repetition of the same linear substitution that is from a cyclic equation of 60 th degree which according to galois theory is of course impossible at that time kronecker went quiet on the subject 22 in the lectures of 1885 86 this mistake is corrected it is concluded that in the case of the alternating permutations of the free variables x 0 x 4 the polynomials and would have to be substituted in a linearly binary manner and further that such a binary behavior is already impossible if one of the per mutations fixes an xi and cyclically permutes the others xj s even without the evidence of this impossibility i still find an unnecessary complication i showed above p 485 that even in the klein four group the impossibility in question arises in order to come to a contradiction kronecker instead combines an op eration of the klein four group with the cyclic permutation of the x 1 x 2 x 3 this is less transparent aside from these secondary points a complete consensus exists there re mains only a subjective difference which i already discussed in detail on pages p 158 159 in the book on the icosahedron but which i do not want to leave un touched here because of its importance for the first time in his investigations into the solution of equations of the fifth degree kronecker begged to have a clear distinction between the natural irrationalities which are rational functions of x 0 x 4 and the other irrationalities which i call accessory incidentally in his first communication of 1858 2 he himself makes an unobjectionable use of an accessory square root is is only in the later work of 1861 15 that he believes that he should forbid the use of accessory irrationalities in the theory of equations altogether in his 1885 86 lectures he maintains this verdict the use of accessory irrationalities is algebraically worthless be cause it tears apart the type in order to emphasize this demand he calls it the abelian postulate in con trast to other authors of similar thinking i have explored as far as possible in my papers printed here above as in the book on the icosahedron the efficacy of using naturally occurring accessory irrationalities there is a principled difference in this thinking i do not want to further emphasize that abel continues to use the roots of unity in his investigations into the solution of the equations by radicals which in the context of his consid erations are also accessory irrationalities see above p 486 footnote 8 which incidentally kronecker continues to do himself because otherwise he would not be able to act on the connection of the equation of the fifth degree with the jacobian equations of the sixth degree nor do i want to argue that it the use of accessory irrationalities is as advantageous in the theory of numbers as it is in function theory because of the simplicity of the higher order algebraic relations in transcendental fields i only want to emphasize the fundamentals 23 when presented with new phenomena such as the efficacy of the accessory irra tionalities should we we stop developing these ideas to align with our current conceptions or rather push back against our narrow systematic ways of think ing and pursue the new ideas in an unbiased way should one be a dogmatist or a natural scientist and endeavor to keep learning from new ideas there is nothing special to be inferred from kronecker s original notes which mr hensel sent to me these are mainly 23 unilaterally described folios of which 1 10 refer to the work of 1858 and 11 23 to those of 1861 it is worth noting that the passages i copied in 1881 are missing on the back of the pages 17 18 there are bills with fifth roots of unity by virtue of which kronecker has evidently been convinced that the g 60 of broken icosahedral substitutions really do exist the criticism which i then apply to the transmitted material is intended to reflect the high position which i have given to kronecker s investigations on the equations of the fifth degree in the above reprinted essays especially in the historical account of the book on the icosahedron 13 see p 141 161 kronecker first found the path which leads into the fundamental questions of the theory only he did not finish it at first and later at least formally refused to accompany others on the way forward k 24 3 appendix a formal bibliography references 1 brioschi francesco sul metodo di
