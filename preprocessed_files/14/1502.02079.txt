appropriate class of fano complete intersections in toric varieties we prove that there is a concrete relationship between degenerations to specific toric subvarieties and expressions for givental s landau ginzburg models as laurent polynomials as a result we show that fano varieties presented as complete intersections in partial flag manifolds admit degenerations to goren stein toric weak fano varieties and their givental landau ginzburg models can be expressed as corresponding laurent polynomials we also use this to show that all of the laurent polynomials obtained by coates kasprzyk and prince by the so called przyjalkowski method 7 correspond to toric degenerations of the corresponding fano variety we discuss applications to geometric transitions of calabi yau varieties 1 introduction mirror symmetry for fano varieties predicts that the mirror of a fano variety x is given by a quasi projective variety x equipped with a regular function w x a 1 with appropriate choices of symplectic and complex structure on both x and x which satisfies certain conditions in particual homological mirror symmetry implies that there is a relationship between the bounded derived category of x and the fukaya seidel category of x w or conversely the fukaya category of x is related to the derived category of singularities of x w see for instance 17 18 for details the pair x w can be viewed as a family of varieties over a 1 from a more classical point of view mirror symmetry predicts that the periods of this family at infinity should be related to the gromov witten invariants of x 9 as an example if x is a smooth n dimensional toric fano variety then there should be some copy of c n contained in x so that on this torus w is expressed as a laurent polynomial w c n c with newton polytope equal to the polytope whose face fan from which x itself is constructed galkin and usnich problem 44 12 and przyjalkowski optimistic picture 38 20 suggest that for each birational map c n 99 k x so that the newton polytope of w is there is a degeneration of the fano variety x to x it is possible that x is covered away from a subset of codimension 2 by tori c n corresponding to toric varieties to which x degenerates and these charts are related by a generalized type of cluster mutation our main result theorem 2 20 is very much in the spirit of this suggestion for x a complete intersection in a toric variety givental 13 provided a method of computing the landau ginzburg model of x this landau ginzburg model is presented as complete intersection in c n which we call x equipped with a function w we call the pair x w obtained by givental s method the givental landau ginzburg model of x in section 2 we introduce certain types of embedded toric degenerations of fano complete inter sections in toric varieties which we call amenable toric degenerations and prove that they correspond to laurent polynomial models of givental s landau ginzburg

a complete intersection fano variety in a toric variety y let x x be an amenable toric degeneration of x then the givental landau ginzburg model of x can be expressed as a laurent polynomial with newton polytope equal to the convex hull of the rays generating the 1 dimensional strata of in the case where x is a smooth complete intersection in a weighted projective space przy jalkowski showed that there is a birational map c m 99 k x to the givental landau ginzburg model of x so that w is a laurent polynomial in 16 ilten lewis and przyjalkowski have shown that there is a toric varietyx expressed as a binomial complete intersection in the ambient weighted projective space so that the complete intersection x admits a flat degeneration to x theorem 2 20 generalizes both the method of przyjalkowski in 20 and its subsequent generaliza tion by coates kasprzyk and prince in 7 theorem 2 20 shows that there are toric degenerations corresponding to all of the laurent polynomials associated to fano fourfolds obtained in 7 and that the laurent polynomials are the toric polytopes of the associated degenerations using the toric degeneration techniques of 14 and 5 przyjalkowski and shramov have defined givental landau ginzburg models associated to complete intersection fano varieties in partial flag varieties they have shown that the givental landau ginzburg models of complete intersections in grassmannians gr 2 n can be expressed as laurent polynomials we provide an alternate approach to this question using theorem 2 20 this provides toric degenerations for most complete intersection fano varieties in partial flag manifolds and shows that we may express their givental landau ginzburg models as laurent polynomials theorem 1 2 theorem 3 4 many fano complete intersections in partial flag manifolds admit degenerations to toric weak fano varieties x with at worst gorenstein singularities and the corre sponding givental landau ginzburg models may be expressed as laurent polynomials with newton polytope of course the word many will be explained in detail in section 3 but as an example this theorem encompasses all complete intersections in grassmannians 1 1 organization this paper will be organized as follows in section 2 we will recall facts about toric varieties and use them to prove theorem 2 20 in section 3 we will apply the results of section 2 to exhibit toric degenerations of complete intersections fano varieties in partial flag manifolds and show that their givental landau ginzburg models admit presentations as laurent polynomials in section 4 we shall comment on further applications to the przyjalkowski method of 7 and how our method seems to relate to the construction of toric geometric transitions as studied by mavlyutov 19 and fredrickson 11 acknowledgements the second author would like to thank v przyjalkowski for many insightful and encouraging conversations and for suggesting the application to complete intersections in partial flag varieties c doran was supported the national sciences and engineering research council the pacific institute for mathematical sciences and the mccalla professorship at the university of alberta a harder was supported by a national sciences and engineering research council doctoral post graduate scholarship 2 general results here we describe the relationship between degenerations of complete intersections in toric fano varieties with nef anticanonical divisor and their landau ginzburg models we will begin with a rapid recollection of some facts about toric varieties a general reference for all of these facts is 8 degenerations and landau ginzburg models 3 2 1 toric facts and notation throughout we will use the convention that m denotes a lattice of rank n and n will be hom m z we denote the natural bilinear pairing between n and m by n m z the symbol will denote a complete fan in m zr and x or y will be used to denote the toric variety associated to the fan we will let be a convex polytope in m z r with all vertices of at points in m which contains the origin in its interior we will let be the fan over the faces of the polytope and we will also denote the toric variety x byx if is an integral convex polytope then we will let n be the set of dimension n strata of in particular denote by 0 the vertices of we will abuse notation slightly and let 1 be the set of primitive ray generators of the fan similarly if c is a cone in then c 1 will denote the set of primitive ray generators of c there is a bijection between primitive ray generators of and the torus invariant weil divisors on x if x is a toric variety then x has a cox homogeneous coordinate ring which is graded by g hom an 1 x c there is a short exact sequence 0 n z 1 an 1 x g 0 where the first map assigns to a point u n the vector n 1 elements of z 1 are in bijection with torus invariant weil divisors and the map g assigns to a torus invariant weil divisor on x its class in the chow group an 1 x applying the functor hom c to the above short exact sequence we get a sequence 1 g c 1 tm 1 where tm m z c let x be a standard basis of rational functions on c 1 there is a partial compactification of c 1 which we may call v c 1 v c 1 so that there is an induced action of g on v and linearizing line bundle so that the categorical quotient v g is the toric variety x since we have assumed that is complete the homo geneous coordinate ring of x is c x 1 equipped with the grading given by the action of g we will abuse notation and say that a subvariety of x is a complete intersection in x if it corresponds to a quotient of a complete intersection in v the sublocus of x corresponding to d x 0 is exactly the torus invariant divisors associ ated to the ray generator despite being given by the vanishing of a function in the homogeneous coordinate ring these divisors need not be cartier a torus invariant divisor d 1 a d is cartier if and only if there is some piecewise linear function on m z r which is linear on the cones of which takes integral values on m if is upper convex then the divisor d is nef the canonical divisor of a toric variety x is the divisor kx 1 d a toric variety x is called q gorenstein if its canonical divisor is q cartier and gorenstein if its canonical divisor is cartier in the future we will be concerned solely with q gorenstein toric varieties a nef partition of will be a partition of 1 into sets e 1 ek 1 so that there exist integral upper convex piecewise linear functions 1 k 1 so that i ej ij this means that for each maximal cone c in the fan there is some vector uc n so that i v max uc v c 4 c f doran and a harder a q nef partition will be a partition of 1 exactly as above except we no longer require that the functions i be integral but only that they take rational values on u m this is equivalent to the fact that each i is determined by a vector uc n z q for each maximal cone c of the divisors determined by a q nef partition are q cartier note that the existence of a q nef partition implies that x is q gorenstein and the existence of a nef partition implies that x is gorenstein 2 2 amenable collections of vectors we begin by letting x be a complete intersection in a toric variety y of the following type definition 2 1 we say that x is a quasi fano complete intersection in y if there are divisors z 1 zk defined by homogeneous equations fi in the homogeneous coordinate ring of y so that f 1 fk forms a regular sequence in c x 1 and there is a q nef partition e 1 ek 1 so that zi ei d we now define the central object of study in this paper fix a q nef partition of as e 1 ek 1 and let x be a corresponding quasi fano complete intersection definition 2 2 an amenable collection of vectors subordinate to a q nef partition e 1 ek 1 is a collection v v 1 vk of vectors satisfying the following three conditions 1 for each i we have vi ei 1 2 for each j so that k 1 j i 1 we have vi ej 0 3 for each j so that 0 j i 1 we have vi ej 0 note that this definition depends very strongly upon the order of e 1 ek now let us show that an amenable collection of vectors may be extended to a basis of n proposition 2 3 an amenable set of vectors vi spans a saturated subspace of n in particular there is a basis of n containing v 1 vk proof first of all it is clear that k rank m or else x would be empty now for each ei choose some i ei we then have a map spanz v 1 vk z k determined by v v 1 v k which when expressed in terms of the basis v 1 vk is upper diagonal with 1 in each diagonal position thus is an isomorphism if spanz v 1 vk were not saturated then there is some v spanq v 1 vk n which is not in spanz v 1 vk but then v could not lie in z k which is absurd since v n and i are elements of m and by definition v i z thus the embedding spanz v 1 vk n is primitive and there is a complementary set of vectors vk 1 vn so that v 1 vn spans n over z now we will proceed to show that amenable collections of vectors lead naturally to a specific class of complete intersection toric subvarieties of y 2 3 toric degenerations now let us define a toric variety associated to an amenable collection of vectors subordinate to a q nef partition of a fan definition 2 4 let v be an amenable collection of vectors subordinate to a q nef partition of a fan let mv be the subspace of m z r composed of elements which satisfy vi u 0 for each vi v define the fan v to be the fan in mv induced by the fan degenerations and landau ginzburg models 5 we may now look at the subvariety of y determined by the equations ei x ei x vi 0 in its homogeneous coordinate ring note that if x is a quasi fano complete intersection in y deter mined by a q nef partition then if the variety determined by the equations above is a degeneration of x following 10 we introduce a definition definition 2 5 an integral square matrix is called mixed if each row contains both positive and negative entries a k m matrix is called mixed dominating if there is no square submatrix which is mixed mavlyutov 19 corollary 8 3 packages corollaries 2 4 and 2 10 of 10 into the following conve nient form if l is an integral vector in a lattice expressed in terms of a fixed basis as l t 1 tn then we define monomials x l and x l to be x l ti 0 x ti i x l ti 0 x ti i proposition 2 6 let l k i 1 zli be a saturated sublattice of z m so that l nm 0 assume that the matrix with rows l 1 lk is mixed dominating then the set of polynomials x li x li for i 1 k forms a regular sequence in c x 1 xm proposition 2 7 if x is a fano complete interesection in a toric variety y and v is an amenable collection of vectors associated to x then v determine a degeneration of x to a complete intersec tion toric variety in the homogenous coordinate ring of y cut out by equations ei x ei x vi 0 proof the definition is clear but what needs to be shown is that the subvariety of y determined by these equations is a complete intersection this is equivalent to the fact that the equations given in the statement of the proposition form a regular sequence to check this we prove that the conditions of proposition 2 7 hold the relevant matrix is the matrix with rows vi 1 call this matrix t if we choose some j ej for each 1 i k then the maximal submatrix vi j is upper triangular with 1 s on the diagonal thus the rows of t form a saturated sublattice of zm now let us choose any square submatrix of t or in other words choose a set u of vertices of 1 and a set v of vectors vi then we must show that the matrix s vi vi v u has a row without both positive and negative entries if the row vi 1 contains negative entries for v 0 vi 1 vim v then in particular for each vij there is some u contained in eij if v 0 v then it follows that for each is contained in a distinct ei 1 eim if i 1 is the smallest such integer and 1 is the corresponding element of u then vi 0 for all vi v since vi ej 0 for all j i thus the corresponding row contains no positive entries finally if l nm is nonzero then there is some vi so that vi 0 for all vertices of 1 if there were such a vi then all points of 1 would be contained in the positive half space determined by vi contradicting the fact that is a complete fan with each cone strictly convex thus applying proposition 2 7 the equations in the proposition above determine a complete intersection in the homogeneous coordinate ring of y 6 c f doran and a harder proposition 2 8 the subvariety of x v of y corresponds to the complete intersection in the coordinate ring of y cut out by equations ei x ei x vi 0 for 1 i k proof we recall that there is an exact sequence 0 n g z 1 an 1 x 0 here g is the map which sends a point v n to the point v 1 z 1 applying the functor hom c to this exact sequence we obtain a dual exact sequence 0 g c 1 g m z c 0 where g hom an 1 x c for an appropriate choice of basis x 1 the induced action of g on c 1 v determines the g action on the homogeneous coordinate ring of x the equations by which we have defined x can be written on the torus c 1 as 1 x vi 1 for 1 i k but this corresponds exactly to the pullback of the locus vi 0 in m which is simply the subspace mv thus in the homogeneous coordinate ring of y the toric subvariety x v is cut out by the equations given in the proposition thus the amenable collection v determines a degeneration of a quasi fano complete intersection in y to a toric variety x v where v is the fan obtained by intersecting with the subspace of m orthogonal to elements of v definition 2 9 a toric degeneration x x of a quasi fano complete intersection determined by an amenable collection of vectors subordinate to a q nef partition e 1 ek 1 is called an amenable toric degeneration of x subordinate to the q nef partition e 1 ek 1 now we define a polytope depending upon the amenable collection of vectors v v 1 vk definition 2 10 let v be an amenable collection of vectors subordinate to a q nef partition e 1 ek 1 equipped with rational convex piecewise linear functions 1 k 1 then we define v to be the polytope defined by m r satisfying equations vi 0 for 1 i k k 1 1 this polyhedron is convex we will refer to the subspace of m z r satisfying vi 0 for 1 i k for v v 1 vk an amenable collection of vectors as mv it is first of all important to show that v is precisely the polytope whose vertices are the generating rays of the fan mv lemma 2 11 let c be a sub cone of so that c mv is nonempty then there is a vertex of c which is contained in ek 1 proof let p be an element of c mv m and choose a set of vectors u u 1 um contained in generating set of the 1 dimensional strata of c so that p is a strictly positive rational linear combination of a set of vectors in u let j be the largest integer so that ej u 6 and j 6 k 1 if no such integer exists then u ek 1 and we are done if not we have that vj u 0 or 1 degenerations and landau ginzburg models 7 for all u u ek 1 since vj ei 0 for i j if p ui u ek 1 aiui for positive numbers ai then vj p ui ej ai 0 since ej u is nonempty thus since p p ui u ek 1 aiui and vj p 0 we must have u ek 1 nonempty the following proposition holds in the case where e 1 ek 1 is any q nef partition of and v is amenable collection of vectors subordinate to this nef partition proposition 2 12 let c be a minimal sub cone of so that c mv is 1 dimensional then there is some point in c mv m so that k 1 1 proof by lemma 2 11 we may deduce that the set c 1 of primitive integral ray generators of c must contain an element of ek 1 we must show that there is some p ek 1 and u 1 um c 1 c 1 ek 1 so that p m i 1 niui mv ni 0 then since ui 1 ek 1 and k 1 is linear on c we must have k 1 1 let us take p in ek 1 c 1 then assume vj p nj 0 if there is no u c 1 so that u ej then vj u 0 for all u c 1 the subset vj u 0 contains c mv by definition and must be a sub stratum of c since c is a convex rational cone by minimality of c we must then have vj u 0 for all u c 1 in particular nj 0 for all j so that ej c 1 now we will fix uj ej for each ej so that ej c 1 6 we know that vj uj 1 take the largest j so that ej c 1 6 then vj p njuj 0 now we have that p njuj is orthogonal to vj and since it is a positive sum of elements in c 1 it is contained in c let j be the next smallest integer so that ej c 1 6 then let vj p njuj sj this is a non negative integer since p and uj are not contained in ej we now have vj p njuj sj uj 0 and vj p njuj sj uj sj vj uj which is zero by the condition that vj i 0 for i j we may now sequentially add positive multiples of each u for e c 1 6 in the same way until the resulting sum is orthogonal to v 1 vk thus we obtain c which lies in mv and satisfies k 1 1 by arguments presented in the first two paragraphs of this proof we may make an even stronger claim if we make further assumptions on the divisors associated to ei recall that we have been assuming that the weil divisors di ei d are q cartier or in other words there are rational convex linear functions i and for dj i ij we can make stronger statements about the relationship between the fan v and the polytope v proposition 2 13 the point in the proof of proposition 2 12 is a primitive lattice point under either of the following two conditions 1 the divisor dk 1 is cartier or 2 all divisors di for 1 i k are cartier proof for 1 if dk 1 is cartier then the function k 1 is integral and thus if k 1 1 implies that is a primitive lattice point in 2 assume that there is some r so that r is still in m recall that p k i 1 niui for some ui ei thus i r ni r is an integer since i is integral and r is in m hence r k i 1 ni r ui p r is in m since p 1 are assumed to be primitive r 1 finally this shows that corollary 2 14 under either of the conditions of proposition 2 13 the polytope in mv obtained as the convex hull of the rays generating v mv is equal to v proof by proposition 2 12 each generating ray of lies inside of v thus the convex hull of the generating rays of v is contained inside of v if is a vertex of v then let c in be the unique cone containing on its interior c 0 if cv c mv then is in c 0 v the interior of cv since k 1 is linear on c 0 v we must have some substratum of v containing on which k 1 is a 8 c f doran and a harder linear function but since is a vertex of v the only such substratum is spanned by itself thus c mv is the ray generated by and is in v 1 therefore all vertices of v are in v 1 and hence are primitive so we can conclude that v it is well known see e g remark 1 3 of 2 that if all facets of an integral polytope are of integral height 1 from the origin then is reflexive thus theorem 2 15 let x be a quasi fano complete intersection in a toric variety y and let e 1 ek 1 be a q nef partition of 1 so that ek 1 corresponds to a nef cartier divisor if x x v is de fined by an amenable collection of vectors v subordinate to this nef partition then x v is a weak fano partial crepant resolution of a gorenstein fano toric variety x v proof the polytope over the ray generators of v is v by corollary 2 14 which is reflexive by remark 1 3 of 2 it follows that the fan v is a refinement of the fan over faces of v obtained without adding rays which are not generated by points in v by lemma 11 4 10 of 8 it follows that x v is a crepant partial resolution of x v whose anticanonical model is x v thus is weak fano 2 4 laurent polynomials we now construct the givental landau ginzburg model of x as fol lows 1 let us take the usual laurent polynomial ring in n variables c x 1 x n and let x be elements of the laurent polynomial ring associated to m in particular if u 1 un is a basis for n then we write x n i 1 x ui i the givental landau ginzburg model associated to a nef partition e 1 ek 1 of 1 is given by the complete intersection x in c n written as 1 ei a x 1 for 1 i k equipped with the superpotential w ek 1 a x here a are constants in c to be completely correct the constants a should be chosen to correspond to complexified classes in the nef cone of x in other words there should be some integral piecewise linear function and a complex constant t so that a t see 1 or 3 for details the goal of this section is to show that the existence of an amenable collection of vectors subor dinate to the q nef partition e 1 ek 1 implies that x is birational to c n k and that under this birational map the superpotential w pulls back to a laurent polynomial in section 2 5 we will determine the relationship between the laurent polynomial w and the polytope v let v 1 vk be an amenable collection of vectors then by proposition 2 3 we may extend v 1 vk to a basis v 1 vn of n let us fix such a basis once and for all now we can rewrite equation 1 in terms of this basis as ei a x ei a j i x vi i 1 1 our construction of the landau ginzburg model is superficially different from givental s construction but the two constructions agree whenever givental s procedure can be carried out degenerations and landau ginzburg models 9 since vi 0 for j i note that each monomial in this expression can be written as j i x vi i 1 xi j i x vi i with non negative exponents on each xj for k j i thus xk is expressed as a laurent polynomial in terms of xk 1 xn and xk 1 can be expressed as a laurent polynomial in terms of xk xn with xk appearing only to non negative degrees substituting in the expression for xk into the resulting expression for xk 1 we may express xk 1 as a laurent polynomial in terms of xk 1 xn repeating this process gives us laurent polynomial expressions for each x 1 xk in terms of xk 1 xn which we call fi xk 1 xn now we have that expressed as a function on c n w ek 1 n i 1 x vi i has x 1 xk appearing only to positive degrees since v 1 vk satisfy vi u 0 for each u ek 1 thus making substitutions xi fi xk 1 xn for each 1 i k into w we obtain a laurent polynomial for w on the variables xk 1 xn we summarize these computations as a theorem theorem 2 16 assume x is a quasi fano complete intersection in a toric variety y then for each amenable toric degeneration x x there is a birational map v c n k 99 k x so that v w is a laurent polynomial proof let fi xk 1 xn be the expressions for xi obtained by using the algorithm described above we define the map v as v xk 1 xn f 1 xk 1 xn fk xk 1 xn xk 1 xn of course as a map from c n k to c n this map is undefined when fi xk 1 xn 0 for 1 i k which is a zariski closed subset of c n k we have shown above that v has image which lies inside of x thus since dim x n k the map v is a birational map from c n k to x thus the choice of an amenable set of vectors v 1 vk determines both a toric degeneration of x and a laurent polynomial expression for its landau ginzburg model in section 2 5 we will examine the relationship between the laurent polynomial v w and the polytope v 2 5 comparing polytopes now we will show that if e 1 ek 1 is a k 1 partite q nef partition of a fan and v is an amenable collection subordinate to this q nef partition then the newton polytope of v w is precisely v let v w be the newton polytope of the laurent polynomial v w take any subset s m then if we choose v n we get stratification of s by the values of v we will define subsets of s sbv s s v s b if s is contained in a compact subset of m z r then let b v max be the maximal value so that s b v is nonempty proposition 2 17 let e 1 ek 1 be a q nef partition of a fan and let v v 1 vk be an amenable collection of vectors in n subordinate to e 1 ek 1 then the monomials of v w correspond to all possible sums of points p ek 1 and u 1 u in k i 1 ei allowing for repetition 10 c f doran and a harder in the set u 1 u so that vi p i 1 ui 0 for all 1 i k proof let i 0 it is clear then that the points in m corresponding to monomials in the laurent polynomial w ek 1 a x are all points q in m obtained as sums of points p ek 1 and u 1 um i j 1 ej so that vj p i 1 ui 0 for all 1 j i now we may apply induction let us define hi xi 1 xn ei a j i x vj j assume that we have sequentially substituted h 1 hi 1 into w to get a laurent polynomial w in the variables xi xn and that the resulting expression has monomials which correspond to all points q in m which are all sums of points p in ek 1 and u 1 u in e 1 ei 1 so that vj p s 1 us 0 for 1 j i 1 allowing for repetition in u 1 u now we show that substituting the expression hi xi 1 xn into w gives a polynomial whose monomials correspond to all points p r j 1 uj so that p ek 1 uj i 1 s 1 es and vj p r s 1 us 0 for all 1 j i again allowing for repetition in the set u 1 ur we may let f be the set of integral points in m corresponding to monomials of w then we have w bmaxvi b 0 xbigb xi 1 xn where gb xi 1 xn f bvi a j i x vj j substituting into w the expression xi hi xi 1 xn gives us a laurent polynomial in xi 1 xn whose monomials correspond to points in set b vi max b 0 f b vi bei each point in this set satisfies vi e b vi bei 0 by the condition that vi ei 1 furthermore vj ei 0 for j i and hence each set of points f b vi bei is orthogonal to v 1 vi and can be expressed as a sum of points p s j 1 ui for u 1 us i j 1 ej and p ek 1 now assume that we have a point q p s j 1 ui for u 1 us i j 1 ej and p ek 1 which is orthogonal to vj for 1 j i then let u u 1 us ei and let q p s i 1 ui u ui ui u ui we see that q is orthogonal to vj for 1 j i 1 since vj u 0 for u u and 1 j i 1 thus q f note that we must have vi q u thus the point q is in f u vi and hence q f u vi u ei since ui u ui is clearly an element of u thus q corresponds to a degenerations and landau ginzburg models 11 monomial in w after making the substitution xi hi xi 1 xn this completes the proof after applying induction proposition 2 18 assume that mv intersects a cone c of in a ray generated by an integral vector m then there is some multiple of in the polytope v w in other words v v w proof this follows from proposition 2 17 and proposition 2 12 according to proposition 2 12 there is an integral point in mv c so that k 1 1 in the proof of proposition 2 12 it is actually shown that this point is constructed as a sum of points p ek 1 and u 1 u k i 1 ei allowing for repetition in the set u 1 u according to proposition 2 17 this point must correspond to a monomial of the laurent polynomial v w theorem 2 19 assume that v is an amenable collection of vectors subordinate to a q nef partition e 1 ek 1 of a fan the polytope v w is equal to v proof we may deduce that v v w from proposition 2 18 thus it is sufficient to show that v w is contained in v or in other words each integral point v w satisfies k 1 p 1 however this is reasonably easy to see we have shown in proposition 2 17 that each point in v w is a sum of a single point p ek 1 and a set of points u 1 u in 1 ek 1 allowing for repetition in the set u 1 u recall that we have a set of vectors w 1 wv n for v the number of maximal dimensional faces of so that k 1 max wi v i 1 now let us apply this to p i 1 ui we obtain max wi p i 1 ui v i 1 max wi p v i 1 i 1 max wi ui v i 1 k 1 p 1 as required note that this is actually a general description of the polytope w without any restrictions on the q nef partition we summarize the results of this section as the following theorem which follows directly from theorem 2 14 and theorem 2 19 theorem 2 20 let x be a complete intersection in a toric variety y so that there is a q nef partition e 1 ek 1 of 1 so that x is a complete intersection of q cartier divisors determined by e 1 ek then if 1 ek 1 is a cartier divisor or 2 e 1 ek are cartier divisors then an amenable collection of vectors v subordinate to this q nef partition determines an amenable degeneration x x v for some fan v and the corresponding laurent polynomial has newton polytope equal to the convex hull of v 1 a more robust geometric statement is available to us in the case where x is a fano variety corresponding to a nef partition in a toric variety this follows from theorem 2 20 and theorem 2 15 theorem 2 21 assume x is a fano toric complete intersction in a toric variety y y cut out by the vanishing locus of sections si h 0 oy ei y for 1 i k and e 1 ek 1 is a nef partition of and that v is an amenable collection of vectors subordinate to this nef partition then v determines 1 a degeneration of x to a toric variety x v which is a crepant partial resolution of of x v and 2 a birational map v c n k 99 k x so that v w has newton polytope equal to v 12 c f doran and a harder 2 6 mutations here we will analyze the relationship between laurent polynomials obtained from the same nef partition and different amenable collections first we recall the following definition from 12 definition 2 22 let f be a laurent polynomial in n variables and let n dx 1 dxn 2 i nx 1 xn a mutation of f is a birational map c n 99 k c n so that and so that f is again a laurent polynomial assume first of all that we have two different amenable collections v and v which are subordi nate to the same nef partition e 1 ek 1 of a fan then associated to both v and v are two maps the first map is v c n k 99 k x and the second is a map 1 v v c k c n k which is defined as x 1 xn 7 xk 1 xn so that v is a birational section of v however the map v v for a different amenable collection v is simply a birational morphism of tori if we let yk 1 yn and xk 1 xn be coordinates on the torus c n k associated to v and v respectively then for each k 1 j n there is a rational polynomial hj xk 1 xn so that the map v v is written as xk 1 xn 7 hk 1 hn in particular to determine this map we have laurent polynomials fi xk 1 xn for each 1 i k so that v xk 1 xn f 1 xk 1 xn fk xk 1 xn xk 1 xn there are bases b and b of n associated to both v and v so that b v 1 vn and v v 1 vk and so that b u 1 un with v u 1 un there is an invertible matrix q with integral entries qi j so that vi n j 1 qi juj and torus coordinates x 1 xn and y 1 yn on c n related by yi n j 1 x qi j j in particular we have hi xn k 1 xn k j 1 fj xk 1 xn qi j n j k 1 x qi j j the map given by the polynomials hi xn k 1 xn for k 1 i n then determine explicitly the birational morphism above associated to a pair of amenable collections subordinate to a fixed nef partition now it is clear that the birational map of tori 1 v v induces a birational map of tori which pulls back the laurent polynomial v w to a laurent polynomial our goal now is to show that this map preserves the torus invariant holomorphic n form n k defined in definition 2 22 first we prove a lemma lemma 2 23 let c n 99 k x c n be a birational map onto a complete intersection in c n cut out by laurent polynomials fi 1 1 xi fi xi 1 xn degenerations and landau ginzburg models 13 which have only non negative exponents in xi 1 xk if i 6 k then the residue resx n f 1 fk agrees with the form 2 i k n k on the domain of definition of proof we argue by induction we may make a birational change of variables on c n so that x 1 y 1 f 1 yk 1 yn for each 1 i k and yi xi for i 6 1 note that dx 1 d y 1 f y 2 yn dy 1 where is some 1 form written as a linear combination of dy 2 dyn with laurent polynomial coefficients thus under our change of variables dx 1 dxn dy 1 dyn dy 1 dyn furthermore under the correct choice of variables we have f 1 x 1 xn 1 1 x 1 f 1 x 2 xn thus n f 1 fk dx 1 dxn x 1 f 1 x 2 xk f 2 fkx 2 xn changing variables to y 1 yn we see that n f 1 fk dy 1 dyn f 2 fky 1 y 2 yn whose residue along the locus y 1 0 which is precisely the image of our torus embedding is just 2 i n 1 f 2 fk since f 2 fk are independent of y 1 thus locally around any point in x where the birational map is well defined and the torus change of coordinates is well defined it follows that the residue of n f 1 f 2 on x agrees with 2 i n 1 f 2 fk repeating this argument for each 2 i k shows that v resx n f 1 fk 2 i k n k now this allows us to prove theorem 2 24 let v and v be two amenable collections of vectors subordinate to a nef partition e 1 ek 1 then the birational map of tori 1 v v is a mutation of the laurent polynomial v w proof it is clear that this map is birational and takes v w to a laurent polynomial to see that 1 v v preserves the form n k we note that there is some open subset u of x on which both v and v induce isomorphisms from open sets uv and uv in c n k in other words we have isomorphisms v uv u and v uv u between open sets from lemma 2 23 we know that v resu n f 1 fk 2 i k n k uv v resu n f 1 fk 2 i k n k uv therefore we must have that on uv v 1 v n k uv n k v and thus v 1 v is a mutation 14 c f doran and a harder figure 1 the grid nodes and graph of 2 5 8 of course theorem 2 24 requires that we start with two amenable collections subordinate to the same nef partition it is possible to have distinct nef partitions corresponding to the same quasi fano variety it would be interesting to show that if we have two such nef partitions and amenable collections subordinate to each then there is a mutation between the corresponding laurent polynomials 3 degenerations of complete intersections in partial flag varieties now we discuss the question of constructing toric degenerations and laurent polynomial expres sions for landau ginzburg models of complete intersections in partial flag varieties recall that the partial flag variety f n 1 nl n is a smooth complete fano variety which parametrizes flags in v cn v 1 vl v where dim vi ni the reader may consult 6 for general facts on partial flag varieties according to 5 and 14 there are small toric degenerations of the complete flag variety f n n 1 nl to gorenstein fano toric varieties p n n 1 nl which admit small resolutions of singularities it is suggested in 21 that the landau ginzburg models of the complete flag variety can be expressed as a laurent polynomial whose newton polytope is the polytope n 1 nl n whose face fan determines the toric variety p n n 1 nl for any fano complete intersection x in f n 1 nl n one obtains a degeneration of x to a nef cartier complete intersection in the toric variety p n n 1 nl and hence conjectural expressions for the landau ginzburg model of x can be given in terms of the givental landau ginzburg model of complete intersections in p n n 1 nl in 21 przyjalkowski and shramov give a method of constructing birational maps between tori and x so that the superpotential pulls back to a laurent polynomial for complete intersections in grassmannians gr 2 n here we will use theorem 2 20 to show that most nef complete intersections x in p n n 1 nl admit an amenable toric degeneration which express the givental landau ginzburg model of x as a laurent polynomial 3 1 the structure of p n 1 nl n in order to construct the toric variety to which f n 1 nl n degenerates we begin with an external combinatorial construction presented in 5 we define a graph n 1 nl n let us take an n n box in the euclidean plane with lower left corner placed at the point 1 2 1 2 let kl 1 n nl let ki ni ni 1 and k 1 n 1 along the diagonal of this box moving from the bottom right corner to the top left corner we place boxes of size ki ki sequentially from 1 to l 1 the region below these boxes is then divided equally into 1 1 boxes along grid lines as shown in the first part of figure 1 from this grid we construct a directed graph with black and white vertices assume that the centers of each of the 1 1 boxes beneath the diagonal are at integral points in the x y plane so degenerations and landau ginzburg models 15 figure 2 roof paths of 2 5 8 connecting sequential white vertices that the center of the bottom left box is at the origin at the center of each 1 1 box beneath the diagonal we place black points in each box b on the diagonal we insert a white point shifted by 1 2 1 2 from the bottom left corner of b see the second part of figure 1 as an example we then draw arrows between each vertex u and any other vertex v which can be obtained from u by a shift of v by either 1 0 or 0 1 directed from left to right or from top to bottom as in the third part of figure 1 let d be the set of black vertices and let s be the set of white vertices in the language of 5 the elements of s are called stars let e denote the set of edges of n 1 nl n we will denote the vertex at a point m n z 2 0 by vm n and an arrow between points vm 1 n 1 and vm 2 n 2 by vm 1 n 1 vm 2 n 2 we have functions h e d s and t e d s assigning to an arrow the vertex corresponding to its head and tail respectively the polytope n 1 nl n is then constructed as a polytope in the lattice m z d as the convex hull of points corresponding to edges e which we construct as follows if d d then let ed be the associated basis vector for m and formally define es to be the origin for s s if is an edge of n 1 nl n then to we associate the point in m given by p eh et definition 3 1 the polytope n 1 nl n is the convex hull of the points p for all e we rapidly review properties of n 1 nl n the toric variety p n 1 nl n is toric variety associated to the fan over faces of n 1 nl n and it has torus invariant weil divisors associated to each vertex v which correspond directly to the points p for e we will refer to the divisor corresponding to the arrow as d torus invariant cartier divisors 0 n d correspond to piecewise linear functions which are linear so that q n for all q in lemma 3 2 2 of 5 cartier divisors which generate pic p n 1 nl n are given we will now describe these divisors definition 3 2 a roof ri for i 1 l is a collection of edges which have either no edges above or to the right and which span a path between two sequential white vertices of n 1 nl n examples of roofs and the associated paths in n 1 nl n are shown in figure 2 associated to each roof is a set of divisors let be an edge in ri and let u be the collection of edges either directly below if is a horizontal arrow or directly to the left of if is a vertical arrow if d is the weil divisor of p n 1 nl n corresponding to the arrow then it is proven in lemma 3 2 2 of 5 that the weil divisor h u d is nef and cartier and that if we take two edges and in the same roof ri then h is linearly equivalent to h we define li to be the line bundle on p n 1 nl n associated to the divisor 16 c f doran and a harder h for any arrow in ri there is an embedding p n 1 nl n p n 1 1 pnl 1 where ni n ni this map is comes from the product of the morphisms determined by each li see theorem 3 2 13 of 5 by work of gonciulea and lakshmibai 14 the pl cker embedding f n 1 nl n p n 1 1 pnl 1 gives a flat degeneration to the image of the divisors ci on f n 1 nl n obtained by pulling back pn 1 1 hi p nl 1 where hi is a generic hyperplane in p ni 1 along form the schubert basis of the picard group of f n 1 nk n and the ample cone is the interior of the cone generated over r 0 by classes ci see proposition 1 4 1 of 6 furthermore the anticanonical bundle divisor of f n 1 nl n is given by kf l i 1 mici here mi is the number of edges in the i th roof of n n 1 nl we choose multi degrees di d 1 i d l i for integers 1 i k so that k i 1 d j i mj let d denote this set of multidegrees then let z di be the intersection of f n 1 nl n with a generic divisor of multi degree di in pn 1 1 pnl 1 under the emebedding the complete intersection xd in f n 1 nk n of the divisors z di is fano since by the adjunction formula kx l i 1 nici x for ni mi k j 1 d i j 1 is the restriction of a very ample divisor on f n 1 nl n if we keep the divisors z di fixed and let f n 1 nl n degenerate to p n 1 nl n we obtain a natural degeneration of x d to a generic complete intersection x d in p n 1 nl n cut out by the vanishing locus of a non degenerate global section of l i 1 o k j 1 l d i j j we may now associate x d to a nef partition of n 1 nl n for each di choose a set ui j of d j i vectors rj in such a way that the sets ui j have pairwise empty intersection and so that no ui j contains an arrow so that h is a white vertex it is possible to choose sets this way since k i 1 d j i mj let ui l j 1 ui j thus we have divisors hi ui h which are nef cartier divisors on p n 1 nl n linearly equivalent to the divisors zdi restricted to p n 1 nl n in p n 1 1 pnl 1 furthermore hi correspond to a nef partition of n 1 nl n let uk 1 l i 1 ri k i 1 ui note uk 1 contains all arrows with h a white vertex then the sets ei ui u define a nef partition of n 1 nl n we have the standard generating set of regular functions on c d written as xm n associated to black vertices vm n of n 1 nl n the monomial associated to an arrow is x xh xt and we define the givental landau ginzburg mirror of x d to be the complete intersection x d 1 ui a x degenerations and landau ginzburg models 17 for 1 i k equipped with superpotential w uk 1 a x here the coefficients a should be chosen so that they satisfy the so called box equations and roof equations of section 5 1 of 5 3 2 associated amenable collections an element of n hom m z is determined by the number that it assigns to each generator of m since we have associated to each black vertex of n 1 nl n a generator ed and we have formally set es to be the origin for s s a white vertex an element of n just assigns to each black vertex of n 1 nl n some integer and assigns the value 0 uniformly to all white vertices to the points in n 1 nl n determined by edges of n 1 nl n the linear operator assigns the number p eh et therefore each n is simply a rule that assigns to each black vertex of n 1 nl n an integer so that the resulting value associated to the arrows in each ej is 1 takes non negative values elsewhere and takes the value 0 on ek for k j our task now is to choose carefully an amenable collection of vectors associated to a given nef partition we will first describe this process for a single in ri there are two distinct cases to deal with 1 the edge is horizontal and t and h are black vertices 2 the edge is vertical we treat these cases separately then combine them to produce the desired function let us take two white vertices of n 1 nl n located at points m 0 n 0 and m 1 n 1 so that there is no white vertex m 2 n 2 with m 0 m 2 m 1 and n 1 n 2 n 0 and let be an edge in the roof between m 1 n 1 and m 2 n 2 1 let be a vertical arrow so that vm n vm n 1 for m 0 m m 1 1 and n 1 1 n n 0 then we define the function so that e i j 1 if i n 1 1 and j m 1 0 otherwise we can check the value of on vertical arrows e i j e i j 1 1 if j n 0 otherwise and on horizontal arrows e i j e i 1 j 1 if i m 1 1 0 otherwise thus takes value 1 only on elements of u and takes positive values only at arrows vn 1 1 j vn 1 j 2 now let us take some vector ri so that vm n 0 1 vm 1 n 0 1 form 0 m m 1 2 define on the basis e i j so that e i j 1 if m 1 i m 1 1 and j n 0 1 0 otherwise thus e i j e i 1 j 1 if i m 1 if i m 1 1 0 otherwise 18 c f doran and a harder 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 figure 3 functions i associated to a horizontal and vertical arrows 1 2 r 1 respectively vertices and arrows which have not been assigned numbers correspond to vertices and arrows to which assigns the number 0 and for any vertical arrow e i j e i 1 j 0 examples of for both vertical and horizontal arrows are shown in figure 3 thus we have chosen n for each ri so that h is not a white vertex in such a way that takes value 1 only at arrows in u and which takes positive values only at horizontal arrows vm 0 1 j vm 0 j thus for any arrows 1 ri and 2 rj for which h i is not a white vertex we have 1 0 for all u 2 and 2 0 for all u 1 now let us choose some k 1 partite nef partition of n 1 nl n given by multidegrees di d i 1 d i r so that k i 1 d i j mi then as in section 3 1 we may choose disjoint collections uj of vectors in the union of all roofs r i 1 rj so that uj ri is of size d j i and so that for all uj there is no uj for which h is a white vertex define uj uj and let e 1 ek 1 be the nef partition described in section 3 1 associated to the sets ui proposition 3 3 if we have a k 1 partite nef partition as described in the preceding paragraph then the collection of vectors v u 1 uk forms an amenable collection of vectors subordinate to the chosen k 1 partite nef partition proof it is enough to show that ui 0 for any u for uj and j 6 i however this follows easily from the fact that each takes the value 1 at u positive values on arrows in u with h a white vertex and 0 otherwise thus uj takes values 1 only at arrows u for uj and positive values on arrows in u with h a white vertex and 0 otherwise we have that u u if 6 thus since ui contains no arrow with h a white vertex ui 0 if u and uj with j 6 i therefore we may conclude following theorem 2 20 that theorem 3 4 let x d be a fano complete intersection in p n 1 nl n determined by a set of multi degrees d then x d admits a degeneration to a weak fano toric variety x with at worst gorenstein singularities furthermore the givental landau ginzburg model of x d admits a torus degenerations and landau ginzburg models 19 map d so that the pullback of the superpotential w along d is a laurent polynomial with newton polytope so that x x example 3 5 we conclude with a non trivial example of our method at work let us take the partial flag manifold f 1 2 5 and we will compute the laurent polynomial associated to a fano hypersurface in this flag manifold first we have variables x 0 1 x 0 0 x 1 1 x 1 0 x 2 1 x 2 0 and x 3 0 and we choose the nef partition of 1 2 5 associated to the roof paths of length 3 and 1 in each block in other words the multi degree d is just 3 1 this nef partition corresponds to the following givental landau ginzburg model 1 x 0 1 x 0 0 x 0 1 x 1 0 x 1 1 x 2 0 x 2 1 x 3 0 x 1 1 x 0 1 x 2 1 x 1 1 x 1 0 x 0 0 x 2 0 x 1 0 equipped with potential w 1 x 2 1 1 x 3 0 x 3 0 x 2 0 the method described in proposition 3 3 produces an amenable collection with only one element which is given by v e 0 1 2 e 0 0 2 e 1 1 3 e 1 0 4 e 2 0 e 3 0 3 e 2 1 which may be completed to a basis if we let v 2 e 0 0 v 3 e 1 1 v 4 e 1 0 v 5 e 2 0 v 6 e 3 0 and v 7 e 2 1 then in terms of this basis the givental landau ginzburg model looks like 1 1 y 1 y 2 y 1 y 4 y 1 y 3 y 5 y 1 y 7 y 6 y 1 y 3 y 1 y 7 y 1 y 3 y 4 y 1 y 2 y 5 y 1 y 4 with potential w y 31 y 7 y 1 y 6 y 31 y 6 y 5 eliminating y 1 from the first equation we obtain y 1 1 y 2 y 4 y 3 y 5 y 7 y 6 y 3 y 7 y 3 y 4 y 2 y 5 y 4 and thus w 1 y 2 y 4 y 3 y 5 y 7 y 6 y 3 y 7 y 3 y 4 y 2 y 5 y 4 1 y 6 1 y 2 y 4 y 3 y 5 y 7 y 6 y 3 y 7 y 3 y 4 y 2 y 5 y 4 2 y 6 y 5 1 y 7 4 further applications recently coates kasprzyk and prince 7 have given a reasonably general method of turning a givental landau ginzburg model into a laurent polynomial under specific conditions we will show that all of their laurent polynomials are cases of theorem 2 16 and that all of the laurent polynomials of coates kasprzyk and prince come from toric degenerations we will also comment on the extent to which we recover results of ilten lewis and przyjalkowski 16 and mention how our results relate to geometric transitions of toric complete intersection calabi yau varieties 4 1 the przyjalkowski method here we recall the przyjalkowski method as described by coates kasprzyk and prince in 7 and show that their construction can be recast in terms of amenable toric degenerations we will conclude that if the przyjalkowski method is applied when y is a fano toric variety then results of section 2 5 imply that all of the laurent polynomials obtained in 7 correspond to amenable toric degenerations of the complete intersection x begin with a smooth toric fano variety y obtained from a reflexive polytope m zr with m a lattice of rank m then we have an exact sequence 2 0 hom m z zn mij pic y 0 20 c f doran and a harder where the vertices of are given an ordering and identified with elements of the set 1 n and where pic y is the cartier divisor class group of y we make the following choices let e be a a subset of 1 n corresponding to a set of torus invariant divisors which generate pic y and let s 1 sk be disjoint sets subsets of 1 n whose corresponding divisors may be expressed as non negative linear combinations in elements of divisors corresponding to elements of e assume that each si is disjoint from e torus invariant divisors of y correspond to vertices of the method of hori vafa 15 for producing landau ginzburg models for x is then applied take variables xi for 1 i n which can be though of as coordinates on the torus c n and impose relations q m j 1 x m j j for each e and q a variable in c and equip the associated toric subvariety of c n with the superpotential w n i 1 xi by assumption we have that elements of e form a basis of pic y therefore the matrix mij can be written as the identity matrix when restricted to the subspace of zn spanned by elements in e since the sequence in equation 2 is exact the elements e 1 en of e are part of a basis e 1 en un 1 un of z n in this basis we have q m j 1 x m j j x n j 1 i 6 x m j j and thus we obtain the relations x q n j 1 j 6 x m j j the superpotential for y then becomes 3 w e q n j 1 j 6 x m j j i e xi the monomials in w correspond to the vertices of and we have eliminated variables corresponding to elements of e since e has cardinality equal to rank pic y the superpotential w is expressed in terms of n variables all values mij involved in the expression above are non negative if j si for some 1 i k since we have chosen s 1 sk to be non negative linear combinations in pic y of elements in e the givental landau ginzburg model of x is then given by the subspace x of c n cut out by equations 1 j si xj for 1 i k equipped with the superpotential obtained by restricting w to x this agrees with the notion of givental landau ginzburg model presented in section 2 up to a translation by the constant k at this point the authors of 7 choose an element si si for each 1 i k and then make the variable substitutions for each si x y 1 j si j 6 si yj if 6 si 1 1 j si j 6 si yj if si degenerations and landau ginzburg models 21 these expressions for x in terms of yj then parametrize the hypersurfaces defined by the equations 1 j si xj since all mij in equation 3 are non negative for j k i 1 si substitution turns w into a laurent polynomial expressed in terms of n k variables y for k i 1 si and xj for j 1 n ki 1 si e 4 2 associated amenable collections now we rephrase przyjalkowski s method in terms of our discussion in section 2 since the monomials of w correspond to vertices of the conditions on s 1 sk and e restrict so that we may choose m vertices of which correspond to a spanning set e 1 en of m then the remaining vertices of and s 1 sk correspond to subsets of this spanning set furthermore the insistence on positivity of elements of s 1 sk in terms of elements of e means that every vertex of e must be a sum n j 1 mi jej so that mi j is positive for j corresponding to an element of ki 1 si thus e 1 en must actually span a maximal facet of in other words we have an n dimensional polytope with simplicial face with vertices e 1 en a generating set for m so that y is a smooth fano toric variety we have now chosen a partition of 0 so that e 1 ek correspond to the vertices to which elements of s 1 sk correspond and are thus composed of disjoint subsets of e 1 en the set ek 1 is simply the comple ment 0 ki 1 ei furthermore we have chosen ei so that elements of u ek 1 are written as u n j 1 mi jej and mi j 0 if ej ei for 1 i k proposition 4 1 the sets e 1 ek and ek 1 form a nef partition of proof by definition this is a partition of vertices of it remains to show the existence of convex piecewise linear functions compatible with this partition but this follows from the assumption that y is a smooth fano toric variety hence all irreducible and reduced torus invariant weil divisors in y are nef and cartier the problem is then to show that there are vi in the lattice n hom m z so that the method of section 2 recovers the laurent polynomial of 7 proposition 4 2 let e 1 ek 1 be a nef partition chosen as above then there is an amenable collection of vectors v subordinate to this nef partition of so that the resulting laurent polynomial is the same as the laurent polynomial obtained by the przyjalkowski method proof let e 1 e m be the basis of n dual to e 1 ed vi ej ei e j this choice of vi then satisfies vi ej 1 if ej ei vi ej 0 if ej ej for j 6 i k 1 and vi 0 for ek 1 thus v 1 vk forms an amenable set of vectors to see that this amenable collection of vectors recovers the laurent polynomial coming from the przyjalkowski method we must choose vectors vk 1 vn n so that v 1 vn form a basis of n here we use the choice of si si each si corresponds to some vertex of represented by a basis vector of m which we may assume is given by ei up to re ordering of the basis of m it is then easy to check that v 1 vk vk 1 e k 1 vn e n form a basis for the lattice n in terms of this basis we have 1 ei k 1 j 1 x vj i 1 xi ej ei j 6 i xj xi 22 c f doran and a harder and thus we have a torus map v c n k 99 k x parametrizing x given by variable assignment xi 1 ej ei j 6 i yj if 1 i k yi otherwise this is expressed in torus coordinates which are dual to the basis v 1 vn this is of course different from the map used in the przyjalkowski method but only because we have changed to a basis dual to v 1 vn and not the basis e 1 e n changing basis so that we return to the standard basis with which we began we must make the toric change of variables on c n xj zj zi if ej ei for 1 i k 1 zj if 1 j k zj otherwise in these coordinates is written as zj yj 1 ej ei j 6 i yj if ej ei for 1 i k 1 1 ej ei j 6 i yj if 1 j k yj otherwise which is precisely the embedding given by the przyjalkowski method of course as a corollary to this theorem 2 20 allows us to conclude that the przyjalkowski method produces toric degenerations of the complete intersection with which we began theorem 4 3 let y be a smooth toric fano manifold and let x be a fano complete intersection in y if the givental landau ginzburg model of x becomes a laurent polynomial with newton polytope by the przyjalkowski method then x degenerates to the toric variety x 4 3 relation to 16 perhaps it now should be mentioned how this work relates to work of przyjalkowski 20 and ilten lewis and przyjalkowski 16 in their situation they begin with a smooth complete intersection fano variety x in a weighted projective space wp w 0 wn by remark 8 of 20 we may assume that w 0 1 and hence the polytope defining wp 1 wn has vertices given by the points e 1 en and n i 1 wiei for e 1 en a basis of m then the przyjalkowski method may be applied essentially verbatim letting s 1 sk correspond to subsets of the vertices e 1 en and e n i 1 wiei then the amenable collection constructed in the proof of proposition 4 2 is given by vi j si e j produces a laurent polynomial associated to the givental landau ginzburg model identical to those constructed by przyjalkowski in 20 up to a toric change of basis proof of this is essentially identical to the proof of proposition 4 2 since przyjalkowski assumes that the divisors of wp 1 w 1 wn which cut out x are cartier we have that x is associated to a q nef partition e 1 ek 1 where e 1 ek are cartier this allows us to apply theorem 2 20 to show proposition 4 4 there is a degeneration of each smooth fano weighted projective complete inter section to a toric variety x so that the convex hull of the ray generators of is a polytope equal to the newton polytope of the laurent polynomial associated to x in 20 this is a weaker version of the theorem proved in 16 degenerations and landau ginzburg models 23 theorem 4 5 16 theorem 2 2 let f be the newton polytope of the laurent polynomial as sociated to a smooth fano weighted projective complete intersection x in 20 then there is a degeneration of x to p f as defined in section 1 1 of 16 the difference between these two statements is that proposition 4 4 shows that x degenerates to a toric variety which is possibly a toric blow up of the variety to which theorem 4 5 shows that x degenerates 4 4 geometric transitions of calabi yau varieties readers interested in compact calabi yau varieties should note that we may reinterpret the work in section 2 as a general description of geometric transitions of toric complete intersection calabi yau varieties we note that there is a reinterpretation of the map v c n k 99 k c n as a section of the toric morphism v c n c n k given by x 1 xn 7 xk 1 xn which sends the subscheme of x cut out by the equations w for some complex value to the subscheme of c n k cut out by the vanishing locus of v w in c n k thus we obtain a birational map between the fibers of w and fibers of the laurent polynomial v w which may be compactified to anticanonical hypersurfaces in x v w note that if e 1 ek 1 is a nef partition of a fano toric variety determined by a reflexive polytope then e 1 ek 1 determine a calabi yau complete intersection z in y which is pre cisely an anticanonical hypersurface in the complete intersection quasi fano variety x determined by e 1 ek according to batyrev and borisov 4 there is a reflexive polytope determined by e 1 ek 1 and a dual k 1 partite nef partition of y which determines a complete intersection calabi yau variety z which is called the batyrev borisov mirror dual of z it is well known 13 that the fibers of the givental landau ginzburg model of x may be com pactified to complete intersections in y and that these compactified fibers are the batyrev borisov mirror dual to anticanonical hypersurfaces z in x now if we degenerate the homogeneous equations in the coordinate ring of y defining x to equations defining some toric variety x v then we obtain simultaneous degenerations of anti canonical hypersurfaces z in x to anticanonical hypersurfaces z of x v in general anticanonical hypersurfaces of x v are more singular than anticanonical hypersurfaces of x classically mirror symmetry predicts that there is a contraction of z z which is mirror dual to the degeneration z z where z and z are mirror dual since z is a toric hypersurface the contracted variety z should be a hypersurface in the toric variety x v we deduce the following theorem 4 6 let z be an anticanonical hypersurface in a quasi fano complete intersection x in a toric fano variety y determined by a nef partition e 1 ek 1 and so that e 1 ek determines the quasi fano variety x assume there is an amenable collection of vectors subordinate to the nef partition e 1 ek 1 which determines an amenable degeneration x x v where the convex hull of the ray generators of v is a reflexive polytope v then z degenerates to a hypersurface in x v and there is a mirror birational map from z to an anticanonical hypersurface in x v note that this is just a birational map not necessarily a birational contraction in work of fredrickson 11 it is shown that an associated birational contraction exists in several cases once one performs appropriate partial resolutions of singularities on both z and z in 19 mavlyu tov showed that any toric variety x with a fixed minkowski decomposition of can be embedded in a fano toric variety y determined by the cayley cone associated to the given minkowski decompo sition and that anticanonical hypersurfaces in x can be deformed to nondegenerate nef complete intersections in y he then showed that a mirror contraction exists if the degeneration of x to x is obtained in this way 24 c f doran and a harder references 1 paul s aspinwall brian r greene and david r morrison the monomial divisor mirror map
