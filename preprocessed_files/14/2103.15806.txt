analogues of morozov theorem in characteristic p 0 marion jeannin october 11 2021 abstract let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p 0 and let g be a reductive k group in this article we prove an analogue of morozov theorem when p is separably good for g and the group satisfies some extra assumptions the latter characterises in characteristic 0 the lie algebras of parabolic subgroups of g by means of their nilradical if now k is any field of characteristic p 0 let x be a smooth projective geometrically connected k curve let us assume that g is a reductive k group which is the twisted form of a constant x group the existence of the aforementioned analogue has been in particular useful to extend to the positive characteristic framework the construction of the canonical parabolic subgroup of g proposed by m atiyah and r bott when k is of characteristic 0 see 1 1 introduction let k be a field and g be a reductive k group in this article we adopt the convention of 15 xix in particular a reductive k group is connected see d finition 2 7 ibid we denote by g lie g the corresponding lie algebra more generally if h g is a subgroup we denote by h lie h the lie algebra of h by hred the reduced part of h by h 0 the connected component of the identity of h if l is a lie algebra we denote by rad l the solvable radical of l namely its maximal solvable ideal let u be a subalgebra of g that only consists in p nilpotent elements one can associate to u a tower of p nil subspaces in g see 9 xviii 10 corollaire 2 set u 0 u and let q 1 ng u 0 the subspace u 1 is the set of all p nilpotent elements of rad q 1 be the normaliser of u 0 the lie algebra q 2 is the normaliser ng u 1 and so on let ui be the set of all p nilpotent elements of the radical of ng ui 1 and qi 1 ng ui this tower stabilises for dimensional reasons we denote by q the limit object of the tower of normalisers and by u the set of all p nilpotent elements of rad ng u so in particular we have that q ng u in characteristic 0 the p nilpotency of the elements of ui is replaced by the classical con dition of ad nilpotency the limit object q can then be shown to be a parabolic subalgebra of g namely q is the lie algebra of a parabolic subgroup of g this result is attributed to v morozov and can be found for instance in 9 viii 10 corollaire 2 a similar construction is possible at the group level this time by considering the tower of smooth connected normalisers of a unipotent smooth connected subgroup u g namely at each iteration one needs to consider the smooth connected part of the normaliser rather than the whole normaliser once again the tower stabilises let us denote by ks the separable closure of k assume that for any field k the unipotent subgroup u is ks embeddable into the unipotent radical of a parabolic k subgroup of g this condition is for instance always satisfied when the field k is perfect a theorem of b veisfeiler see 49 and borel tits see 5 corollaire 3 2 then states that the limit smooth connected normaliser is a parabolic subgroup of g denoted by pg u its lie algebra is denoted by pg u 1 ar x iv 2 10 3 15 80 6 v 2 m at h r t 8 o ct 2 02 1 finally the hilbert mumford kempf rousseau theory see 27 and 33 2 3 allows to associate to any p nil lie subalgebra of g an optimal parabolic subgroup thus an optimal parabolic subalgebra denoted by pg u respectively pg u where u is an optimal cocharacter for u see section 4 for more details on the construction and the definition of the objects involved here in this article we aim to determine under which conditions on p and g the following statement holds true statement 1 1 analogue of morozov theorem in characteristic p 0 let k be an alge braically closed field of characteristic p 0 and g be a reductive k group let u g be a lie subalgebra assume that u is the set of p nilpotent elements of rad ng u then under some assumptions on p and g that are detailed in the remaining part of this introduction and that in particular exclude slp factors in the simply connected cover of g 1 the normaliser ng u is a parabolic subalgebra of g 2 this parabolic subalgebra satisfies the following equalities ng u pg u pg u where u g is a unipotent smooth connected subgroup such that lie u u hypotheses on p will in particular allow the existence of such a subgroup moreover in characteristic 0 a well known corollary of morozov theorem states that any proper maximal subalgebra of the lie algebra of a reductive group is either reductive or parabolic see 9 viii 10 corollaire 1 if now k is an algebraically closed field of characteristic p 0 one may also wonder whether such an analogue of this corollary still hold true namely statement 1 2 let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p 0 and g be a reductive k group let q g be proper restricted p lie subalgebra then q is either parabolic or p reductive note that a premet proved this statement to hold true when g is simple and the characteristic is very good for g by making use of a case by case analysis see 39 we will provide a uniform proof of this statement under more restrictive hypotheses on the characteristic before going any further let us briefly remind the reader of the context in characteristic p 0 some lie algebras come endowed with an additional p power map g g x 7 x p such that 1 for any k and any x g we have x p px p 2 for any x g we have ad x p ad x p 3 for any x 1 x 2 g we have x 1 x 2 p x p 1 x p 2 w x 1 x 2 where we denote by w x 1 x 2 0 r p 1 r u adxu 1 adxu 2 adxu p 1 x 1 for u going through all the maps 1 p 1 0 1 that take r times the value 0 given a restricted p lie algebra restricted p subalgebras respectively p ideals are subalge bras respectively ideals that are stable under the p power map for more details we refer the reader to 13 ii 7 n 3 and 47 chapter 2 let us only briefly remind here a few specificities and definitions let g be a restricted p lie algebra g over k an element x g is p nil if there is an integer m n such that x p m 0 a restricted p nil algebra is p nil if all its elements are p nilpotent when g is of finite dimension any restricted p subalgebra which is p nilpotent is also p nil moreover let h g be the coxeter number of g the values for any type of g are listed in table 1 when p h g g mcninch shows in 34 that any nilpotent element x g is of p nilpotency order equal to 1 that is x p 0 when g is a restricted p subalgebra we denote by nil g its nilradical that is its maximal nilpotent ideal by radp g its p radical namely its maximal p nilpotent ideal by zg its center 2 by radu g the lie algebra of the unipotent radical of g if g lie g is the lie algebra of a smooth connected algebraic group these objects should definitely be compared recall in particular the following properties see 48 lemma 2 1 and 26 lemmas 2 6 and 2 13 together with 26 remarks 2 7 lemma 1 3 let k be a field of characteristic p 0 1 let g be a connected reductive k group and assume that p is separably good for g see 38 definition 2 2 or 2 1 for a precise definition in practice this amounts to avoid very small characteristics and some factors of ap 1 type in characteristic p then the equalities zg rad g nil g hold true 2 let h be a smooth connected k group and assume that p is separably good for the quotient h radu h then the p radical of h is both the lie algebra of the unipotent radical of h and the set of all p nilpotent elements of rad h satement 1 2 involves p reductive lie algebras this notion specific to the characteristic p framework underlines a very specific behaviour of lie algebras in this context more precisely when k is of characteristic 0 a reductive lie algebra is the lie algebra of a reductive group or equivalently a lie algebra that has a trivial nilradical in characteristic p 0 these two properties are no longer equivalent which justify to define the notion of p reductivity definition 1 4 a restricted p algebra h is p reductive if its p radical is trivial remark 1 5 let us note that if k is a perfect field and g is a reductive k group such that p is separably good for g the lie algebra of g is p reductive according to lemma 1 3 the p radical of g is indeed the lie algebra of the unipotent radical of g thus is trivial assume that p h g and that g admits a representation which is 1 almost faithful meaning that its kernel is of multiplicative type 2 of low height more precisely let v be such a representation let us denote by htg v max 0 the dynkin height of the representation where is a weight for the action of t on v then v is of low height if p htg v in 2 proposition 4 7 v balaji p deligne and a j parameswaran show a result for which the first point of the theorem above is an immediate corollary we start by showing that the second assumption is superfluous when g is simple and simply connected this amounts to widen the range of admissible characteristics without any additional assumptions on g in particular we have some gains for types f 4 e 6 e 7 and e 8 see 2 p 14 when g satisfies the standard hypotheses see 23 2 9 the definition is reminded in section 2 1 a premet and d i stewart provide a proof of the first point of the analogue of morozov theorem as stated above by means of a case by case study that relies on the classification of semisimple groups see 40 corollary 1 4 note that these hypotheses in particular implie the semisimplicity of g that explains why the authors consider the nilradical rather than the p radical of the lie algebra in their statements let us note that when g is semisimple these objects coincide see for example remark 2 9 in section 2 5 below our assumptions on g and p we explicit below approach in the most refined version of the analogue statement of morozov theorem the level of generalities of 40 proofs proposed here are uniform and allow to characterise the parabolic subgroup obtained here by means of geometric invariant theory the article is organised as follows after a quick reminder of some prerequisites in the first section we will study high characteristics in section 3 when p is big enough obtaining an analogue of morozov theorem as stated above makes no difficulties but allows to better understand issues that are specific to the characteristic p 0 framework more precisely 1 in characteristic p 0 the existence of an integration of any restricted p nil lie sub algebra u g is not always satisfied namely given a restricted p nil lie subalgebra u g one can not always associate to u a unipotent smooth connected subgroup u g such that lie u u note that this is well known to be always possible in characteristic 0 thanks to the existence of the exponential moreover when such an integration exists nothing ensures a priori that it will be compatible with the adjoint representation this last condition would ensure the equality of the normalisers ng u and ng u these two issues have been studied in a previous article see 26 they underline the existence of a huge gap between 3 the characteristic p h g for which an integration given by the truncated exponential always exists even if it does not satisfy all the properties of the integration process in characteristic 0 in particular this integration is no longer compatible with the adjoint representation the characteristics p h g that are separably good for g in this last framework only a punctual integration can be expected to be satisfied a priori nevertheless when u is such as in the analogue of morozov theorem it is integrable into a unipotent smooth connected subgroup as shown in 26 lemma 5 1 see also 26 lemma 3 5 for the equality of normalisers 2 when p 0 given a subalgebra h g the normaliser ng h is no longer smooth in general in characteristic 0 this smoothness condition for normalisers is automatically satisfied this is a consequence of a theorem of p cartier see for example 13 ii 6 n 1 1 counter examples to this property in characteristic p 0 can be found in 20 lemma 11 we thus treat separately even if there are some similarities the case of the characteristics p h g that is explained in section 5 and the one of separably good characteristics for g which is studied in section 6 let us stress out that the smoothness of normalisers of subsets of g for the action of g is a crucial issue in this article this is explained in section 4 in which we show the following result theorem 1 6 let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p 0 le g be a reductive k group and u g be a restricted p lie subalgebra such that u is the set of p nilpotent elements of rad ng u assume that p is not of torsion for g let also pg u be the optimal parabolic subgroup of u defined by the hilbert mumford kempf rousseau method see 27 theorem 3 4 for the existence of such a subgroup the following assertions are equivalent 1 the algebra ng u is the lie algebra of the parabolic subgroup pg u 2 the connected component ng u 0 is smooth 3 this connected component satisfies the equality ng u 0 pg u a theorem of p deligne see 12 th or me 2 7 stated when g gl v under some as sumptions on v and generalised in the article of v balaji p deligne and a j parameswaran to any reductive group g when p h g see 2 theorem 2 5 allows to measure the lack of smoothness of infinitesimally saturated subgroups see definition 1 7 below in particular when p h g a direct application of this theorem leads to the conclusion that if u g is a restricted p nil p lie subalgebra then ng u 0 red differs from ng u only by a subgroup of multiplicative type this comes from the fact that the normaliser of any such u in g is infinitesimally saturated as a reminder the following notion of infinitesimal saturation gen eralises that of saturation introduced in 43 4 it has first been introduced by p deligne see 12 d finition 1 5 let us recall that when p h g the exponential map is well defined definition 1 7 a subgrouph g is infinitesimally saturated if for any p nilpotent element x h lie h the t power map factors through h in other words the situation is the following ga g h expx we show in section 5 1 1 that the infinitesimal saturation of the normaliser of a p nil lie subalgebra is immediate when the adjoint representation is of low height and that this still holds true under the assumption p h g which is slightly less restrictive this is a crucial key to prove in section 5 that analogues of morozov theorem hold true when p h g namely we show 4 theorem 1 8 analogue of morozov theorem when p h g let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p 0 and g be a reductive k group such that p h g where h g is the coxeter number of g see section 2 1 let u g be a lie subalgebra of g let us assume that u is the set of all p nilpotent elements of the radical of ng u then 1 the normaliser ng u is a parabolic subalgebra of g 2 this parabolic subalgebra satisfies the equalities ng u pg u pg u where u g is a unipotent smooth connected subgroup such that lie u u when p h g such a subgroup exists according to 2 section 6 see also 26 proposition 3 1 this theorem can be rephrased in terms of p radicals corollary 1 9 let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p 0 and g a reductive k group such that p h g let u g be a restricted p subalgebra of g such that u radp ng u then ng u is the lie subalgebra of the parabolic subgroup obtained in theorem 1 8 let us remark that theorem 1 8 above is a particular case of the following corollary for which the tower of normalisers stabilises directly corollary 1 10 under the assumptions of theorem 1 8 let u g be a restricted p nil subalgebra then 1 the tower of normalisers u converges to a parabolic subalgebra of g denoted by ng u 2 this limit object satisfies ng u pg u lie ng v where the subgroup ng v is the limit object of the tower of smooth normalisers associated to radu ng u 0 red section 6 is dedicated to prove the existence of analogues of morozov theorem in sep arably good characteristics recall that when p h g the existence of an integration is ensured by the exponential map unfortunately this morphism is no longer defined when p is smaller than h g nevertheless a punctual integration is still possible when p is separably good for g thanks to the existence of springer isomorphisms nred g vred g as a reminder a springer isomorphism is a g equivariant isomorphism of reduced varieties where nred g stands for the reduced nilpotent k scheme of g and vred g is the reduced unipo tent k scheme of g such an isomorphism always exists under our assumptions as explained in 26 section 3 1 the notion of infinitesimal saturation is thus replaced in this context by that of infinitesimal saturation see 26 definition 4 1 for nred g vred g a springer isomorphism this allows us to define definition 1 11 let nred g vred g be a springer isomorphism for g a subgroup g g is infinitesimally saturated if for any p nilpotent element x g the t power map x ga g t 7 tx factorises through g in other words the situation is the following ga g g x this notion leads to a natural extension of p deligne theorem for infinitesimally satu rated subgroups see 26 theorem 1 1 and allows to settle on the same way as before the lack of smoothness of normalisers unfortunately it is not possible to adapt the reasoning provided in characteristic p h g to show that ng u is infinitesimally saturated this is what justifies the additional assumption in the statement of theorem 1 12 below theorem 1 12 analogue of morozov theorem when p is separably good let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p 0 and g be a reductive k group assume p to be separably good for g let nred g vred g be a springer isomorphism for g if u g is a lie subalgebra such that u is the set of p nilpotent elements of rad ng u and if ng u is infinitesimally saturated then 5 1 the normaliser ng u is a parabolic subalgebra of g 2 this parabolic subalgebra satisfies the equalities ng u pg ju pg u where ju g is a unipotent smooth connected subgroup such that lie ju u such a subgroup exists according to 26 lemma 5 1 let us stress out that ng u must be infinitesimally saturated for theorem 1 12 to hold true as any parabolic subgroup is infinitesimally saturated according to 26 lemma 4 2 this result admits the following reformulation by means of the p radical of the involved normaliser corollary 1 13 let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p 0 and g be a reductive k group assume that p is separably good for g let u g be a restricted p lie subalgebra such that u radp ng u let us also assume that ng u g is infinitesimally saturated then ng u is the lie subalgebra obtained in theorem 1 12 let us finally remark that theorem 1 12 is a particular case of the following corollary for which the tower of normalisers stabilises immediately corollary 1 14 under the assumptions of theorem 1 12 let u be a restricted p nil p subalgebra of g then 1 the tower of normalisers of u converges to a parabolic subalgebra of g 2 this limit object satisfies ng u pg u lie ng ju where the subgroup ng ju is the limit object of the tower of smooth normalisers associated to radu ng u 0 red analogues of morozov theorem in characteristic p 0 admit the following corollary which is introduced here as an analogue of theorem 1 8 stated in characteristic p h g to avoid the additional assumption of infinitesimal saturation corollary 1 15 of theorem 1 8 let k be an algebraically closed field and g be a reduc tive assume k to be of characteristic p h g and g to be endowed with a symmetric g equivariant non degenerate bilinear form let p g be a lie subalgebra such that p is a nilpotent subalgebra of g then 1 the subalgebra p is a parabolic subalgebra of g 2 it is the parabolic subalgebra obtained in theorem 1 8 namely one has p lie pg exp p pg p this result allows us to show in the relative case and under some additional assumptions on the base that some lie algebras are parabolic this is explained in the last section of this article see section 7 we provide there an example of a practical application of theorem 1 8 the latter is useful here under the corollary 1 15 form more precisely let k be a field and c be a projective smooth and geometrically connected k curve let also g be a reductive c group which is the twisted form of a constant reductive c group g 0 namely g 0 is obtained from a reductive k group by base change in other words there is a g 0 torsor e for which g e g 0 when k is of characteristic 0 m atiyah and r bott consider the harder narasimhan filtration of the lie algebra g seen as a vector bundle over c 0 e r e 1 e 0 e 1 el g where the indices are chosen in such a way that the term e 0 is the one for which the semistable quotient is of slope 0 the authors show in 1 10 that e 0 is a parabolic subalgebra of g and they call canonical parabolic subgroup of g the subgroup from which it derives if now k is any field and g is a reductive c group k a behrend extends in 3 the notion of canonical parabolic subgroup when k is any field its definition does no longer involves the harder narasimhan filtration of g in 36 proposition 3 4 v b mehta and s subramanian show that the definition given by m atiyah and r bott in characteristic 0 still makes sense in the aforementioned framework when k is of characteristic p max 2 dim g 4 h g 1 1 see also 37 theorem 2 6 for a refinement of the statement that only requires p 2 dim g their proof relies on techniques coming from representation theory theorem 1 8 allows to provide a new proof of this equality when p 2 dim g 2 that mimics the one already known 1 the original result is stated with the height of g which is equal to the coxeter number of g minus 1 6 in characteristic 0 the latter can be found in 1 let us finally mention that a langer shows that the definitions of canonical parabolic subgroup are the same when the g 0 torsor e admits a strong harder narasimhan filtration see 30 definition 3 1 and proposition 3 3 in section 7 we make use of corollary 1 15 to show proposition 1 16 if k is of characteristic 0 or p 2 dimg 2 and if g is endowed with a symmetric g equivariant non degenerate bilinear form then 1 the subbundle e 0 g is the lie algebra of a parabolic subgroup q g and e 1 is the lie algebra of its unipotent radical denoted by radu q 2 this parabolic subalgebra satisfies the equalities e 0 pcang and e 1 radu p cang where p cang is the canonical parabolic subgroup of g and p can g is its lie algebra let k be the function field of c and k its algebraic closure over the geometric generic fiber we have that e 0 k pg e 1 k 3 the subbundles ei are p nil p ideal of e 0 pcang for any r i 0 a substantially part of this article comes from the author s ph d manuscript see 25 2 prerequisites 2 1 context in this section and unless otherwise stated we denote by k a field of characteristic p 0 and g is a reductive k group let t g be a maximal torus let us denote by w w g t the weyl group and g t the associated root system let then be a positive root system and 1 n be the corresponding root basis that defines the corresponding borel subgroup t b g assume for the moment that is irreducible let n i 1 ai i be its highest root the coxeter number of g denoted by h g is the height of plus 1 whence the equality h g n i 1 ai 1 for any root denote by the corresponding coroot let n i 1 bi i be the coroot associated with the highest root the characteristic p of k is of torsion for if there exists i 1 n such that p divides bi bad for if there exists an integer i 1 n such that p divides ai good for if its not bad for really good for if it is good and if p does not divide n 1 when is of type an for a more detailed discussion on torsion integers for g see for example 46 good charac teristics are for instance studied in 44 0 3 the values of torsion good and very good integers are listed in the table below the rank of the algebraic k group g is also mentioned it is equal to the dimension of a maximal torus of g which is the same for any maximal torus of g see 15 xix 1 5 and is denoted by rg g type of g torsion integers good characteristics very good characteristics rg g h g an 1 any p n 1 n n bn where n 2 2 2 2 n 2 n

that when the characteristic is very good for g the lie algebra of g is endowed with a non degenerate killing form see for example 45 i 5 3 10 1 16 and 23 2 9 when is no longer irreducible and g is any reductive group the coxeter number of g is the highest coxeter number of the irreducible components of the characteristic p of k is of torsion if p is of torsion for one irreducible component of or if p divides the order of the fundamental group of g bad for g if it is bad for one irreducible component of good respectively very good for g if it is good respectively very good for each irre ducible component of g t table 1 allows to check that if the characteristic is very good for g then it is not of torsion for g moreover when p h g then p is very good for g finally let us recall that a reductive k group g satisfies the standard hypotheses see 23 2 9 if h 1 the derived group of g is simply connected h 2 the characteristic of k is good for g h 3 there exists a symmetric non degenerate g equivariant bilinear form over g let us recall that according to 41 i 8 corollary if g is endowed with a symmetric non degenerate g equivariant bilinear form the lie algebra is semisimple i e its solvable radical is trivial see 47 1 7 definition let us remark that according to what precedes when g is simple and simply connected and p is very good for g this latter satisfies the standard hypotheses let us finally note that j c jantzen provides in 23 2 9 some explicit characterisation for lie algebras of reductive groups that satisfy the standard hypotheses in 24 b 6 some criteria for adjoint reductive groups to satisfy these when k is an algebraically closed field of characteristic p and g is a semisimple k group if p is not of torsion for g the following corollary can be deduced from 31 theorem 2 2 and remark a corollary 2 1 of 31 theorem 2 see 26 remark 2 2 let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p 0 and g be a reductive k group assume that p is not of torsion for g let u g be a restricted p nil p subalgebra then u is a subalgebra of the lie algebra of the unipotent radical of a borel subgroup b g let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p 0 and let g be a reductive k group when g is semisimple the characteristic of k is separably good for g if 1 the integer p is separably good for g 2 the morphism gsc g where gsc is the simply connected cover of g is separable when g is a reductive group the integer p is separably good if it is separably good for the derived group g g see 38 definition 2 2 as underlined in the paragraph that follows definition 2 2 in 38 if p is really good for g then it is separably good this last condition is nevertheless less restrictive when g is of type a which is the only type for which good separably good and very good integers do not coincide 2 2 rank and faithful representations in this section the field k is assumed to be algebraically closed lemma 2 2 let d be the dimension of a minimal faithful representation of g then the inequality d rg g is satisfied proof let g gln be a minimal faithful representation of g the representation is also a faithful representation of a maximal torus t g if we denote by n the dimension of t then necessary one has d n rg g lemma 2 3 the inequality 2 h g 2 22 d holds true for any reductive k group g 8 proof when g is simple the values of h g and rg g are listed in table 1 and one can check that the inequalities 2 h g 2 22 rg g 22 d are indeed satisfied according to lemma 2 2 let us denote by gi the simple groups defined by the irreducible components of the restriction of a faithful representation of g to gi is still a faithful representation for gi let us denote by di the dimension of a minimal faithful representation of gi by what precedes one has d di h gi for any gi as there exists an integer i for which h g h gi the inequalities 2 h g 2 22 m i 1 di 22 d then hold true whence the expected result 2 3 parabolic subalgebras a parabolic subalgebra p g is the lie algebra of a parabolic subgroup p g this is equivalent to requiring the existence of a cartan subalgebra t g such that p t g where the subset is a parabolic subset of see 15 xxvi proposition 1 4 note that this description allows us to naturally define the coxeter number of a parabolic subgroup of g it is the height plus one of the highest root of the associated parabolic subset in particular h g h b for any borel subgroup b g when k is of characteristic 0 these conditions are satisfied if and only if p contains the lie algebra of a borel subgroup of g when k is a field of characteristic p 0 such a characterisation does no longer hold true a parabolic subalgebra always contains a borel subalgebra because a parabolic subgroup always contains a borel subgroup but there are some pathological characteristics for which one can find lie subalgebras of g that contain a borel subalgebra but do not derive from a parabolic subgroup of g proposition 2 4 if k is of characteristic p 6 2 3 a subalgebra p g is parabolic if and only if it contains a borel subalgebra proof let p g be a lie subalgebra that contains a borel subalgebra b one needs to show that p is of the form t g with t and as in the preamble of this section as p contains a borel subalgebra b it contains the lie algebra of a maximal torus t this cartan subalgebra acts on p via the lie bracket the roots of t define a family of endomorphisms of t that are diagonalisable and that commute with each other they are therefore simultaneously diagonalisable and p decomposes as a sum of weight spaces for this action namely one has that p t g it remains to show that the subset contains a positive root system this is immediate as by assumption p contains the lie algebra of a borel subgroup the subset is of type r see 15 xxii d finition 5 4 2 according to 15 xxii th or me 5 4 7 one needs to remark that is closed in other words for any roots such that one needs to show that this last condition is satisfied as soon as p 6 2 3 according to 15 xxiii corollaire 6 6 remark 2 5 when g is of type a 1 one only needs to require p 6 2 in the above proposi tion examples 2 6 we provide here examples of lie subalgebras that contain a borel subalgebra and do not derive from a parabolic subgroup of g 1 when g pgl 3 and k is of characteristic 3 let us consider the lie subalgebra p a b cd e f 0 td g d t k pgl 3 k it contains the borel subalgebra of upper triangular matrices with trace 0 notwith standing this the lie algebra p cannot be written as the lie algebra of a parabolic sub group p pgl 3 as this can be checked when k is of characteristic 0 as no parabolic subgroup admits p as a lie algebra 2 we still assume that g pgl 3 and k is an algebraically closed field of character istic p 3 we consider the example of 31 we set x 0 1 00 0 1 0 0 0 and y 9 0 0 01 0 0 0 2 0 let u x y pgl 3 be the subalgebra generated by x and y it is an ad nilpotent subalgebra of pgl 3 its normaliser is given by npgl 3 u a b cd e b g d i that contains a borel subalgebra namely the lie algebra of the borel subgroup obtained by conjugating the borel subgroup of upper triangular matrices by 0 1 01 0 0 0 0 1 how ever p does not derive from a parabolic subgroup of g for the same reasons as the one mentioned previously 2 4 lie algebras and normalisers the formalism used in this section is developed in 13 ii 4 we especially refer the reader to 13 ii 4 3 7 for notations let a be a ring and g be an affine a group functor as a reminder 1 if r is an a algebra we denote by r t the algebra of polynomials in t and by the image of t via the projection r t r t t 2 r we associate to g a functor in lie algebras denoted by lie g and which is the kernel of the following exact sequence 1 lie g r g r g r 1 p i for any y lie g r we denote by e y the image of y in g r in what follows the notation lie g r refers both to the kernel of p and to its image in g r the lie algebra of g is given by the k algebra lie g a and is denoted by lie g g according to 13 ii 4 n 4 8 proposition when g is smooth or when a is a field and g is locally of finite presentation over a the equality lie g a r lie g a a r lie g r lie gr holds true for any a algebra r these are sufficient conditions when the aforemen tioned equality is satisfied the a functor lie g is representable by w g where for any a module m and any a algebra r we set w m r m a r 2 the a group functor g acts on lie g as follows for any a algebra r the induced morphism is the following adr gr aut lie g r g 7 adr g lie g r lie g r x 7 i g xi g 1 when g is smooth in particular when lie g is representable the g action on lie g defines a linear representation g gl g see 13 ii 4 n 4 8 proposition with the above notations given 1 a closed subgroup h g the normaliser of h in g is the closed subscheme of g defined for any k algebra a by ng h a g g a ad g h r h r for any a algebra r 2 a subalgebra h g i the normaliser of h in g is the closed subscheme of g defined for any k algebra a by ng h a g g a ad g h r h r for any a algebra r 10 ii the normaliser of h in g is the closed subscheme of g defined for any k algebra a by ng h a g g a ad g h r h r for any a algebra r the following result is a quick reminder of useful facts for the proofs that follow lemma 2 7 let g be a reductive k group then 1 let d be the dimension of a minimal faithful representation for g if p 22 d then all normalisers of subspaces of g are smooth see 20 theorem a 2 let h g be a closed subgroup then i the inclusion ng h ng lie h is satisfied in particular if h is smooth this leads to the inclusion ng h r ng hr for any a algebra r see 26 lemma 6 3 ii if moreover h g is smooth then in general only the inclusion lie ng h ng h holds true if h k is zariski dense in h then lie ng h x g ad h x x h h h k see 26 lemma 6 4 2 5 radicals of a restricted p lie algebra lemma 2 8 let k be a perfect field of characteristic p 0 and g be an algebraic k group assume 1 that p 3 or if p 2 that k is algebraically closed and g has a root system for which all the irreducible components are of an type which is the only characteristic 2 option that can occurs in this article 2 that g is an extension of a k group of multiplicative type s by a smooth connected algebraic k group h such that radu h is a normal subgroup of g 1 h g s 1 then the p radical of g identifies with the set of all p nilpotent elements of rad g namely one has radp g x rad g x is p nilpotent lie radp h proof one inclusion is clear the p radical of g is a p nil p ideal of rad g thus radp g is contained in the set of all p nilpotent elements of rad g see the second point of 26 lemma 2 5 the derived sequence 0 h g s 0 lie lie is still exact as h is smooth and the morphism g s is surjective see 13 ii 5 n proposition 5 3 this is moreover an exact sequence of p morphisms of restricted p lie algebras see 13 ii 7 n 2 1 and n 3 4 for the compatibility with the p structure let x be a p nilpotent element of rad g the image lie x is a p nilpotent element of s which is toral because it is the lie algebra of a group of multiplicative type the p power map is therefore injective over s this implies the vanishing of lie x 0 the exactness of the derived sequence ensures that x belongs to the image of lie let us say x lie z 11 for an element z h as is a p morphism of restricted p lie algebras and as by assumption x is p nilpotent there exists an integer m such that 0 x p m z p m z p m this implies that z p m 0 so that z is p nilpotent because is injective the element x thus belongs to the set of p nilpotent elements of rad g im lie which is a solvable ideal of im lie contained in rad im lie h rad h in other words any p nilpotent element of rad g is the image of a p nilpotent element of rad h radp h radu h according to 26 lemma 2 13 and 26 remark 2 10 for the characteristic 2 case by assumption the image of radu h radp h is an ideal of g it is a p nil p ideal of g because lie is a p morphism of restricted p lie algebras in other words the inclusion lie radu h radp g holds true to summarise we have shown the following inclusions x rad g x is p nilpotent lie radu h radp g whence the desired equality remark 2 9 if g is a reductive k group such that g is endowed with a symmetric non de generate g equivariant bilinear form then g is semisimple according to 41 i 8 corollary its radical thus its center is trivial in other words in this case the adjoint representation ad g gl g is faithful therefore under this assumption any ad nilpotent element is p nilpotent in particular the equality of p ideals nil h radp h holds true for any restricted p lie subalgebra h g lemma 2 10 let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p 0 let g be a reductive k group such that g is endowed with a symmetric non degenerate g equivariant bilinear form and let b g be a borel subalgebra then the equality nil b b holds true proof the inclusion nil b b is clear according to 8 4 n 4 proposition 6 let be a positive root system associated to b let us thus show the converse inclusion according to 26 remark 2 14 the p radical of b is the lie algebra of the unipotent radical of b table 1 allows to check that requiring the existence of leads to avoid the pathological cases according to the third point of 26 lemma 2 5 this p radical is the nilradical of b if and only if zb b let us show that this is indeed the case we assumed that g was endowed with a symmetric non degenerate g equivariant bilinear form according to 41 i 8 corollary the lie algebra g is therefore semisimple its center is in particular trivial according to 47 corollary 5 6 then by making use of the inclusions z 0 g zb zg see for instance 6 corollary 11 11 one obtains by derivation that the lie algebra zb is trivial this is so because lie zb zb according to 26 remark 6 2 to summarise we have shown that nil b radp b lie radu b g where the first equality comes from 26 lemma 2 5 iii the second equality comes from 26 remark 2 14 moreover as g is orthogonal to g as soon as 6 one necessarily has b nil b whence the desired equality 3 first steps unsurprisingly under some assumptions that allow to reproduce the characteristic 0 frame work an analogue of morozov theorem can be easily shown to hold true in characteristic p 0 especially the characteristic p has to be quite big this results are already instructive as they underline obstructions one has to face when considering the positive characteristic setting 12 3 1 when all the normalisers are smooth when k is an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 or p 0 really high theorem 1 8 is an immediate application of veisfeiler borel tits theorem see 5 corollaire 3 2 more precisely proposition 3 1 let k be an algebraically closed field and g be a reductive k group we denote by d the dimension of a minimal faithful representation of g assume that k is of characteristic 0 or p 22 d finally let u g be a restricted p nil p subalgebra such that u is the set of all p nilpotent elements of rad ng u then ng u is a parabolic lie subalgebra of g remark 3 2 wheng gln the assumptions of proposition 3 1 amount to require p 22 n proof under the assumptions of the proposition the normaliser ng u of u g for the adjoint action is smooth this is clear in characteristic 0 ensured by 20 theorem a when p 22 d moreover assumptions of the proposition warrant the existence of an exponential map al lowing to integrate the nil lie subalgebra u into a unipotent smooth connected subgroup u g such that lie u u to make sure that this integration is compatible with the adjoint representation im plying in particular that the normalisers ng u and ng u are the same according to 20 lemma 4 3 this is detailed for instance in 13 ii 6 corollary 3 4 when k is of characteristic 0 in 2 6 and 26 proposition 3 1 when p 22 d for the existence of an integration for u because if p 22 d then p 2 h g 2 h g according to lemma 2 3 and in 42 lecture 4 theorem 5 and 2 4 6 for the compatibility between the truncated exponential map and the adjoint representation once again one can apply these results because p 2 h g 2 for this last point see also remark 5 2 2 below let v be the unipotent radical of ng u 0 note that it is well defined because ng u ng u the latter being smooth because of the assumptions we made on the characteristic the inclusion u v is clear because u is a unipotent smooth connected normal subgroup of ng u so one has the following inclusions of lie algebras u v moreover according to lemma 2 7 the equalities of lie algebras lie ng u lie ng u ng u are satisfied as one has v radu ng u 0 red the subalgebra v lie v is a p nil p ideal of g see 26 lemma 2 12 by assumption u is the set of all p nilpotent elements of rad ng u whence the inclusion v u so we have shown that u v moreover as u and v are smooth connected subgroups of g this last equality of lie algebras allows to conclude that u v see 13 ii 5 5 5 to summarise the unipotent smooth and connected subgroup u v is the unipotent radical of the connected component of its smooth normaliser according to veisfeiler borel tits theorem 49 and 5 corollary 3 2 the latter is thus a parabolic subgroup of g and lie ng u ng u is therefore a parabolic subalgebra of g remark 3 3 when h g p 22 d even if an exponential map still exists and allows us to integrate the restricted p nil p subalgebra u into a unipotent smooth connected subgroup u g none of the steps arising in the previous proof is immediate more precisely the compatibility between the exponential map and the adjoint representation does no longer hold true see for example 20 lemma 4 3 this is a consequence of 43 4 1 7 neither does the smoothness of normalisers see 20 lemma 11 3 2 conditional statements when the killing form is non degenerate a careful reading of the proof of v morozov theorem provided in 9 viii 10 corollaire 2 leads to obtain the following conditional statement theorem 3 4 let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p 0 and let g be a reductive k group assume that p h g and that g is endowed with a symmetric non degenerate g equivariant bilinear form let u be a subalgebra of g such that 13 1 the lie algebra u is the set of all p nilpotent elements of rad ng u 2 the orthogonal of u for the form is a subalgebra of g then ng u is a parabolic subalgebra of g the following lemma will be useful in the proof of theorem 3 4 lemma 3 5 let h and u be two restricted p lie subalgebras of g such that the subalgebra u is the set of all p nilpotent elements of rad h the killing form over g denoted by is non degenerate the subalgebra h is the normaliser of u in g namely we have h ng u the orthogonal of u for is a subalgebra of g then u is the orthogonal of h for the killing form over g proof let q be the orthogonal of u for the killing form over g let us show that q h the vanishing condition x q 1 q 2 x q 1 q 2 0 is satisfied for any pair q 1 q 2 q and any x u therefore the lie bracket x q 1 lies in q where q is the orthogonal of q for hence we have obtained that for any q 1 q the lie bracket x q 1 belongs to u the lie algebra q normalises u in other words we have shown that q ng u h moreover and by assumption the lie algebra u is an ideal of h that only consists in p nilpotent elements this is in particular a nilpotent ideal it is therefore contained in the nilradical of h and it is thus orthogonal to h for the killing form over h according to 8 4 n 4 proposition 6 in other words we have shown that h q u hence the equality h q proof of theorem 3 4 as p h g the restricted p nil p subalgebra u is integrable into a unipotent smooth connected subgroup u g see 2 6 but also 26 proposition 3 1 let n 0 ng u 0 red be the smooth connected part of the normaliser of u in g set v 1 radu n 0 and let us consider the tower of smooth connected normalisers of u in g this tower converges to a limit object n which is the smooth connected part of the normaliser of its unipotent radical v for dimensional reasons according to 5 th or me 3 2 the smooth connected normaliser n is a parabolic subgroup of g denoted by pg u there are two possibilities 1 either pg u g in this case v 0 is trivial so is u 0 thus the vanishing of lie u u and the result follows 2 or pg u is a proper parabolic subgroup ofg it thus contains a borel subgroup b g as k is algebraically closed thus perfect the unipotent smooth connected subgroup v is k embeddable into the unipotent radical of a borel subgroup b g see 5 corollary 3 7 moreover as the lie algebras involved here are of finite dimension we have the following inclusions u v radu b nil b b where the last inclusion is ensured by 8 4 n 4 lemma as by assumption g is endowed by which is non degenerate one can deduce that b b nil b v u ng u where the last equality is ensured by lemma 3 5 and remark 2 9 by assumption p h g in other words p 6 2 when g is of type a 1 and p 3 otherwise see table 1 in this case the parabolic subalgebras of g are exactly those that contain the lie algebra of a borel subgroup see section 2 3 the lie algebra ng u satisfies this condition according to what precedes because pg u ng u is a parabolic lie subalgebra of g thus it contains a borel subalgebra of g so ng u is indeed a parabolic subalgebra of g 14 4 hilbert mumford kempf rousseau method and the optimal parabolic subgroup in what follows and unless otherwise stated the field k is algebraically closed of characteristic p 0 and g is a reductive k group we assume that p is not of torsion for g let us denote that this condition is in particular always satisfied when p h g see section 2 1 in what follows and by convention a k variety is a separated k scheme of finite type in particular a variety is not assumed to be reduced a priori if y is a k variety we denote by y its reduced closure 4 1 construction set x g d and let ad g be the diagonal adjoint action of g over x let u g be a restricted p nil p subalgebra of dimension d 0 and let x 1 xd be a basis of u as explained in this section the hilbert mumford kempf rousseau method see 27 allows us to obtain a parabolic subgroup which is of the form pg u where u is a cocharacter of g which is not unique optimal for u in a certain sense such that u is a lie subalgebra of the lie algebra of radu pg u set x x 1 xn x and s ad g x ad g x red x lemma 4 1 the subvariety s x is closed it is ad g invariant and not empty moreover the vector x does not belong to s proof of lemma 4 1 only the assumption on the emptiness of s is not clear to prove it one only needs to check that 0 s according to corollary 2 1 there exists a borel subgroup b g such that u is a lie subalgebra of radu b let t b g be a maximal torus any dominant regular cocharacter of g with respect to t satisfies the equality limt 0 t z 0 for any z radu b d in particular we have that 0 ad g x ad g x red x let us denote by x x x g limt 0 ad t x exists the attractor of x see 16 1 4 for any x x let x 0 limt 0 ad t x s or simply x 0 x 0 when there is no ambiguity on the chosen cocharacter finally let us set s x vanishing order of t 7 ad t x x 0 a 1 x if x 0 s 0 otherwise let us note that in particular s x x g n has strictly positive values if and only if x 0 s as a reminder any cocharacter gm k defines a parabolic subgroup pg such that for any k algebra a one has pg a g g a limt 0 t g exists its unipotent radical ug satisfies ug a g pg a limt 0 t g 1 for any k algebra a the following theorem has been established by g r kempf in the more general case where we consider a finite dimensional linear representation v of g a closed g invariant subvariety s v d it allows to associate to u optimal cocharacters and the subgroup they define theorem 4 2 kempf 27 theorem 3 4 the function 7 s x admits a maxi mum b 0 on x x set s x x x s x b and is indivisible such a cocharacter s x is said to be optimal under these conditions 1 the set s x is non empty 15 2 there exists a parabolic subgroup ps x g denoted by pg u in what follows and such that pg u pg for any s x the parabolic subgroup pg u is the optimal parabolic subgroup of u 3 the set s x is a principal homogeneous space under radu pg u k 4 any maximal torus of pg u contains a unique cocharacter that belongs to s x lemma 4 3 let u and pg u be as in theorem 4 2 above let us denote by ug u the lie algebra of the unipotent radical of pg u then the following inclusion u ug u holds true proof according to 11 i proposition 2 1 8 the lie algebra of pg u writes pg u cg u ug u where the factor cg u g 0 is the lie algebra of the centraliser of the torus gm which is denoted by cg and ug u n 0 gn with gn v g t v t nv the choice of u is such that s x u is strictly positive in particular the weights are all strictly positive for x so for any vector of the basis of u hence for u this allows us to obtain the inclusion u ug u remark 4 4 if u g is a nilpotent lie algebra of dimension 1 the results of 23 ensure the existence of a parabolic subgroup pg u g such that u ug u with no restriction on the characteristic of k as in this case the ad g orbite of x is never closed according to 23 2 10 let us remark that in the general case without restriction on the dimension the additional assumption on p comes from the fact that one needs to embed u into the lie algebra of the unipotent radical of a borel subgroup to ensure that the ad g orbit of x is not closed see the proof of lemma 4 1 4 2 obstruction in what follows we assume that the restricted p nil p lie subalgebra u g is the set of all p nilpotent elements of rad ng u 4 2 1 preliminary remarks the whole point here is to obtain the inclusion ng u pg u as explained by the following lemma lemma 4 5 let us assume that the inclusion ng u pg u holds true then under our assumptions on u this normaliser is a parabolic subalgebra of g proof in lemma 4 3 we have shown the inclusion u ug u assume this inclusion to be strict in this case u is a proper ideal of u nug u u ug u see for example 21 chapter 1 3 exercice 7 the intersection ug u ng u u is a restricted p algebra because it derives from an algebraic group namely nug u u see lemma 2 7 this is a p ideal of ng u because ng u pg u by assumption it is p nil according to 26 remark 2 14 because ug u is the lie algebra of the unipotent radical of pg u in particular u is a nilpotent thus solvable ideal of ng u so it is contained in rad ng u as u is the set of p nilpotent elements of this radical one necessarily has u u thus the equality u ug u ng u this contradicts the strictness of the inclusion u ug u in other words the equality u ug u is satisfied remark 4 6 the inclusion required in lemma 4 5 is immediate in some cases for example when ng u is smooth one only needs to apply 33 corollary 9 2 to ng u 0 to conclude remark 4 7 when the subalgebra u g is generated by a p nilpotent element x and with no additional assumption the normaliser ng u is necessarily the lie algebra of a parabolic subgroup of g indeed under this assumption and according to g r kempf 35 proposition 18 1 there exists an optimal cocharacter of u associated to x this means that 1 the element x is of weight 2 for the conjugation by 16 2 the image of gm by is contained in the derived group of a levi subgroup l g for which x lie l is distinguished namely any torus contained in cg x is contained in the center of g the conjugation on g induces a grading on g i gi for such a grading the normaliser ng u is contained in g 0 indeed let n i z ni ng x thus the bracket n x lies in g 2 in particular the bracket ni x is necessarily trivial for any i 0 because the bracket gi gj belongs to gi j in other words ni cg x for any i 0 where cg x is the centraliser of x in g but as g satisfies the standard hypotheses the equalities cg x pg lie pg lie cg x hold true see 23 5 9 remark therefore ni 0 vanishes for any i 0 and the inclusion ng x pg is satisfied 4 2 2 characterisation proof of theorem 1 6 the first point of remark 4 6 above is actually an equivalence this is the point of theorem 1 6 proof of theorem 1 6 let us denote by ug u radu pg u 1 3 there are two possibilities either pg u g then the p nil lie algebra u is trivial because so is u ug u as a reminder this last inclusion is provided by lemma 4 3 or pg u is a proper parabolic subgroup of g in this case we have that u ug u radp pg u radp ng u rad ng u where the first inclusion is given by lemma 4 3 the first equality is provided by 26 remark 2 14 the second equality comes from the hypothesis ng u pg u and the last inclusion is provided by 26 lemma 2 5 the inclusion radp ng u u is satisfied a priori because u is the set of all p nilpotent elements of rad ng u as a reminder the p radical of ng u is a p nil p ideal to summarise u radp ng u and the equality u ug u is satisfied moreover one has ng u 0 ng ug u 0 ng ug u 0 pg u 0 pg u where the inclusion is given by lemma 2 7 the first equality is ensured by assumption and the last equality is provided by 15 xxii corollaire 5 8 5 in other words pg u ng u 0 is a monomorphism that induces an isomorphism at the lie algebras level and whose source is a smooth k group the smoothness is ensured by 15 xxvi d finition 1 1 because pg u is a parabolic subgroup by 13 ii 5 5 5 this monomorphism is therefore an open immersion as pg u is a closed subgroup of ng u 0 the equality pg u ng u 0 holds true and this latter group is smooth over k 3 2 this is clear because a parabolic subgroup is smooth by definition see 15 xxvi d finition 1 1 2 1 according to lemma 4 5 one only needs to obtain the inclusion ng u pg u this is provided by 33 corollary 9 2 because ng u 0 is smooth by assumption let us detail the reasoning the notations are those of section 4 the idea is to show thatng u 0 normalises pg u because thenng u 0 ng pg u pg u the equality is immediate because pg u is its own normaliser see 15 xxii corollaire 5 8 5 this leads to the desired inclusion the smoothness of the normaliser ng u 0 is crucial it allows us to restrict our proof to a reasoning on k points by zariski density of ng u 0 k in ng u 0 because k is 17 algebraically closed see 17 corollaire 10 4 8 thus one only needs to show that ad h pg u pg u for any h ng u 0 k according to 27 corollary 3 5 the subgroup ad h pg u and the optimal parabolic subgroup defined by an optimal cocharacter of s ad h x are the same in other word the equality ad h pg u ps ad h x is satisfied moreover the sets s x and s ad h x are equal according to 33 corollary 7 because for any h ng u 0 k i the sets x x and x ad h x are the same ii one has s x s ad h x this leads to the equality ps ad h x pg u for any h ng u 0 k whence the inclusion ng u 0 pg u remark 4 8 when k is of characteristic p h g we introduce in section 5 1 1 the notion of infinitesimal saturation defined by p deligne and show by making use of lemma 5 1 that the subgroup ng u g is infinitesimally saturated this ensures that lemma 2 8 holds true in the context we are interested in see 13 theorem 2 5 allows us to show the equality u radu pg u more easily as one only needs to apply the aforementioned lemma 5 analogue of morozov theorem in characteristic p h g in this section k is an algebraically closed field of characteristic p 0 and g is a reductive k group we propose here to prove theorem 1 8 and corollaries 1 10 and 1 9 that are respectively analogue and corollaries of morozov theorem in characteristic p h g let u g be a restricted p nil p lie subalgebra see 26 section 2 2 for the terminology and the fundamental properties of the objects involved in this section under the assumption p h g a theorem of j p serre in 42 part ii lecture 2 theorem 3 and detailed by v balaji p deligne and a j parameswaran in 2 section 6 provides the existence of an integration for any restricted p nil p lie subalgebra of g see also 26 proposition 3 1 nevertheless and as already mentioned in the introduction such an integration is a priori no longer compatible with the adjoint representation in particular if we denote by u g the unipotent smooth connected subgroup that integrates u there is no good reasons for the equality ng u ng u to hold true a priori moreover as mentioned in the introduction the normalisers involved here are a priori no longer smooth the notion of infinitesimal saturation developed here allows to settle this issue 5 1 measuring the lack of smoothness of normalisers 5 1 1 infinitesimal saturation the following lemmas are crucial in the proof of theorem 1 8 let us note that they are clear as soon as p 2 h g 2 as detailed in section 5 2 2 lemma 5 1 let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p 0 and g be a reductive k group such that p h g let u g be a restricted p nil subalgebra of g the normaliser of u in g is infinitesimally saturated proof let x lie ng u ng u be a p nilpotent element note that the equality is provided by lemma 2 7 one needs to show that the t power map factors through ng u one has 1 if x u as u integrates u the inclusions exp tx u ng u ng u are satisfied see for example 26 lemma 6 4 2 if x ng u u let ux u kx be the restricted p lie algebra generated by u and x this is a lie subalgebra because x ng u it remains to show that it is p nil this means that we have to check that any element of the form u x with u u are p nilpotent as p h g this amounts to verify that u x p 1 by assumption u kx u and jacobson formulaes provide the desired result according to 26 proposition 3 1 there exist unipotent smooth connected subgroups of g denoted respectively by u and ux such that lie ux ux respectively lie u u note that 18 these constructions are independent from the borel subalgebra in whose we embed u and ux in particular it is not necessary to choose the same borel subalgebra for both u and ux by construction we have that u ux these groups are smooth so the following equalities dim ux dimux and dim u dimu hold true as u ux is of codimension 1 the unipotent smooth connected subgroup u is of codimension 1 in the unipotent smooth connected subgroup ux according to 13 iv 4 corollaire 3 15 this is a normal subgroup of ux this quotient is isomorphic to ga thus ux ng u ng u where the last inclusion comes from lemma 2 7 so exp tx ng u and ng u are infinitesimally saturated the proof of lemma 5 1 allows us to show the following result lemma 5 2 under the previous assumptions let us denote by u expb u where b g is a borel subalgebra such that u radu b then ng u is infinitesimally saturated proof of lemma 5 2 we have to show that for any p nilpotent element x lie ng u ng u the t power map factors through ng u the equality is ensured by 26 lemma 6 4 according to the proof of lemma 5 1 the image of x by the t power map is an element of ng u hence the latter is infinitesimally saturated remark 5 3 we just have shown in lemma 5 1 that the normaliser ng u of any p nil subalgebra u g is infinitesimally saturated in particular the normaliser of theorem 1 8 is infinitesimally saturated this condition is necessary for the statement to be true because any parabolic subgroup of g is infinitesimally saturated see 26 lemma 4 2 5 1 2 exponential map and normalisers let g be a reductive group over an algebraic closed field k of characteristic p h g when u g is a reductive subgroup only the inclusion ng u red ng u red is a priori satisfied see for instance 26 lemma 6 4 et remark 6 7 when u g is a restricted p nil p subalgebra let u expb u where b g is a borel subalgebra such that u radu b under our assumptions on p the normalisers are equal we start by showing the equality of the reduced parts the preliminary remark is useful for what follows remark 5 4 the exponential map built in 2 section 6 and used in 26 proposition 3 1 allows us to define for any p nilpotent element of g the t power map expx ga g t 7 exp tx that itself induces a morphism u w u ga g x t 7 exp tx expx t the unipotent smooth connected subgroup obtained in 26 proposition 3 1 is actually the subgroup u g generated by the image of the morphism for the fppf topology see 14 vib proposition 7 1 and remarque 7 6 1 indeed this subgroup is unipotent according to 13 iv 2 n 2 proposition 2 5 as it can be embedded into the unipotent radical of the borel subgroup of g connected according to 14 vib corollaire 7 2 1 because u w u is geometrically reduced and geometrically connected and reduced thus smooth because it is the image of a smooth thus reduced group the inclusion u u is clear and once again the equality of the considered groups follows from the equality of their lie algebras let b be a borel subgroup of g such that u radu b as the exponential map expb induces the identity on the tangent spaces the equality lie u u is necessarily satisfied according to 2 ii 5 5 5 the k groups u and u are then equal because u and u are smooth and connected 19 lemma 5 5 with the previous notations one has ng u red ng u red proof as the equality lie u u holds true only the inclusion ng u red ng u red has to be checked by zariski density as k is algebraically closed we only need to do the reasoning on k points according to 17 corollaire 10 4 8 because the schemes we consider are locally of finite type let g ng u red k and let h u k as u expb u there exists an element x u k such that h expb x exp x where the last equality comes from the preamble of 26 section 3 1 and remark 5 4 because x u k is a closed point we still make use of the aforementioned remark to obtain that ad g h ad g exp x exp ad g x u k because g ng u red k where the last inclusion is obtained by making use of the g equivariance of exp the fppf formalism of remark 5 4 allows us to obtain the equality at the group level lemma 5 6 the subgroup ng u normalises u in particular the equality ng u ng u holds true proof let r be a k algebra for any g ng u r and h u r there exists a fppf covering s r such that hs x 1 s 1 xn sn where xi ur r s et si s by making use of the g equivariance of expxi for any i 1 n we then have ad g h s n i 1 ad gs xi si n i 1 ad gs xi si u s g r u r because u is generated by as an fppf sheaf therefore ad g h u r in other words we have obtained the inclusion of normalisers ng u r ng u r for any k algebra r yoneda s lemma then allows us to conclude that ng u ng u as the lie algebra u derives from a unipotent smooth connected subgroup u g according to 26 proposition 3 1 the inclusion ng u ng u is still satisfied see for instance lemma 2 7 hence the equality of normalisers 5 2 proof of theorem 1 8 and corollaries 1 9 1 10 and 1 15 5 2 1 proof of theorem 1 8 proof of theorem 1 8 as p h g the restricted p nil p subalgebra u can be integrated into a unipotent smooth connected subgroup u g according to 26 proposition 3 1 in particular one has u ng u 0 red let us denote by v the unipotent radical of ng u 0 red the inclusion u v is necessarily verified at the lie algebras level this leads to the inclusion u v by veisfeiler borel tits theorem the first point of theorem 1 8 is obtained if one can show that the equality u v holds true note that as u and v are smooth connected subgroups of g this allows us to conclude that u v according to 13 ii 5 5 5 set w radu ng u 0 red according to 26 lemma 2 12 the lie algebra w lie w is a p nil p ideal of lie ng u 0 red lie ng u the subgroup ng u being infinitesimally saturated 2 theorem 2 5 ensures that w is a normal subgroup of ng u hence w is a p nil p ideal of lie ng u ng u it is therefore contained in the p radical of ng u which is itself contained in the set of all p nilpotent elements of rad ng u according to 26 lemma 2 5 ii the latter is nothing but u by assumption whence the conclusion to summarise we have obtained the following inclusions w u v according to lemma 5 5 the reduced normalisers ng u red and ng u red are the same so are respectively their connected components and their unipotent radicals in other words the groups v and w are equal whence the equality of lie algebras w v u the groups u v are smooth and connected therefore the equality of their lie algebra lifts to an equality of groups namely we have shown that u v see 13 ii 5 5 5 in other words u is equal to radu ng u 0 red its smooth connected normaliser is therefore a parabolic subgroup ofg according to 5 corollaire 3 2 we denote it by pg u ng u 0 red as the normaliser ng u is infinitesimally saturated the subgroup ng u 0 red is normal in ng u according to 2 theorem 2 5 in other words the inclusion ng u ng ng u 0 red holds true this leads to the equality ng u 0 red ng u because ng u 0 red is its own 20 normaliser according to 15 xxii corollaire 5 8 5 whence ng u is a parabolic subgroup of g the equality we just obtained in particular implies that ng u ng u 0 red is a parabolic subgroup of g the same reasoning as above thus allows us to conclude that ng u ng u 0 red is a proper parabolic subgroup of g note that this reasoning can be done because ng u is infinitesimally saturated see lemma 5 1 therefore the equalities ng u ng u 0 red ng u 0 red ng u pg u are satisfied and ng u lie ng u lie pg u is indeed a parabolic subalgebra of g namely it is the lie algebra of the parabolic subgroup of g obtained by applying the borel tits theorem to u moreover as theorem 1 6 holds true because the normaliser ng u 0 red ng u are smooth the normaliser ng u is actually the optimal parabolic subgroup pg u obtained by kempf rousseau theory see section 4 remark 5 7 lemma 5 6 together with the fppf formalism it introduces allow to drastically simplify the proof of theorem 1 8 by ensuring the equality of the whole normalisers ng u and ng u and not only the equality of their smooth part lemma 26 2 13 then allows us to conclude the notations are the same as the one in the above proof the properties satisfied by u which is unipotent smooth and connected implied the inclusion u v radu ng u 0 red that leads to an inclusion of lie algebras u v by assumption u is the set of p nilpotent elements of ng u now as v ng u is p nil according to 26 lemma 2 12 the inclusion v u is trivially satisfied this leads to the desired equality u v we deduce from the latter and as in the proof that ng u is a parabolic subgroup of g as we already know that ng u ng u there is no need of any additional argument to show that ng u is parabolic 5 2 2 remarks on the characteristic 0 or p high enough let g be a simple and simply connected k group when p 0 or p 2 h g 2 the adjoint representation is compatible with the exponential map in other words any g nilpotent element x g satisfies the equality ad exp tx y exp t ad x y for any y g in characteristic p 0 the assumption on p is required because the p structure of g in particular leads to the following identity for any x and y g see 13 ii 7 3 3 x y p x p y p w x y this implies that the equality exp x exp y exp x y is no longer satisfied in general when x and y are any p nilpotent elements of g see 43 remarque 4 1 7 requiring p 2 h g 2 allows to settle this issue because under this assumption the adjoint representation ad is of low heigh the proof of 20 lemma 4 3 details the reasoning when g is of type an 1 this easily extends to the other types let x be a p nilpotent element of g denote by l the left multiplication by tx and by r the right multiplication by tx then ad exp tx exp l exp r exp l r p 1 n 1 cnl n r p n where the cn k are non trivial coefficients whence the vanishing wp l r p 1 n 1 cnl n r p n h g 1 n 1 cnl n r p n p 1 n h g cnl n r p n 0 as in each sum one of the factor is raised to a power greater than h g thus vanishes because when p h g any nilpotent element y g is killed by the p power namely y p 0 see 34 4 4 such a compatibility drastically simplifies the proof of lemmas 5 1 et 5 2 let us explain why in more details let u be a nilpotent subalgebra of g according to 26 proposition 3 1 this subalgebra can be integrated into a unipotent smooth connected subgroup of g denoted by u expb u 21 where b g is a borel subalgebra such that u radu b a priori only the inclusion lie ng u ng u holds true according to lemma 2 7 but the compatibility between the adjoint representation and the exponential map ensures that these normalisers are actually equal lemma 5 8 let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p 0 and g be a simple and simply connected k group such that p 2 h g 2 let also u be a p nil subalgebra of g then the equality ng u lie ng u holds true proof one needs to show that any x ng u actually belongs to lie ng u according to lemma 2 7 this amounts to show that ad u x x u for any u u k let us thus consider u u k as u expb u integrates u for the same reasons as in the proof of lemma 5 5 there exists an element y u such that u exp y therefore we have ad u x x ad exp y x x exp ad y x x because ad and exp are compatible 0 n p adn y n x x 1 n p adn y n x u because x ng u by assumption when ad and exp are compatible so in particular when p 2 h g 2 the equality ng u lie ng u is thus satisfied when p 2 h g 2 lemmas 5 2 and 5 1 are thus the same their proof is immediate in this context proof of lemmas 5 1 and 5 2 when p 2 h g 2 according to what precedes and by mak ing use of lemma 2 7 one can show that the equalities lie ng u ng u lie ng u are satisfied one needs to show here that given any p nilpotent element x ng u the t power map t 7 exp tx factors through ng u let y u and x g be a p nilpotent element as the adjoint representation is compatible with the exponential map it is so with the t power map this leads to ad exp tx y exp ad tx y 0 n p ad tx n n y u because x ng u by assumption remark 5 9 when g is any reductive k group the following assumptions allow in a certain framework to weaken the condition on p without losing the compatibility between a representation of g and the exponential map let us denote by htg g max 0 the dynkin height of the adjoint repre sentation the restriction on p amounts to require the adjoint representation to be of low height this means that p htg g as htg g 2 n i 1 i 2 h g 2 where i are the fundamental weights for the t action see 42 lecture 4 example of theorem 8 more generally one can weaken the restrictions on p by considering an almost faithful representation i e a representation whose kernel is of multiplicative type and whose dynkin height is minimal in this case the exponential map and the representation are compatible see 2 4 5 et 4 6 and the previous reasoning can be extended to this context let us note that the adjoint representation is always almost faithful when g is a reductive k group because its kernel is nothing but the center of g which is of multiplicative type when g is simple and simply connected if g is not of type f 4 e 6 e 7 or e 8 a low height almost faithful representation always exists when p h g see the remark that follows theorem 4 7 in 2 22 remark 5 10 the lack of compatibility between the exponential map and the adjoint representation has been studied in 29 chapter 4 in paragraph 4 2 the author defines an operator denoted by had compatible with the truncated exponential definition 5 11 a subalgebra u g is had weakly saturated if and only if had x u u for any p nilpotent element x ng u in practice when p h g a restricted p nil p subalgebra u g is had weakly saturated if and only if its normaliser ng u is infinitesimally saturated one inclusion is clear assume u to be had weakly saturated and let y u for any p nilpotent element x ng u and for any t r where r is a k algebra we have ad exp tx y exp thad x y p 1 i 0 thad x i i y u as any coefficient hadi x y u moreover if ng u is infinitesimally saturated let x be a p nilpotent element of ng u for any y u and t ga we have ad exp tx y p 1 i 0 thad x i i y u because ng u is infinitesimally saturated in particular had x y u thus u is weakly had saturated let us remark that in particular lemma 5 1 allows us to conclude that if p h g any restricted p nil p subalgebra of g is had saturated 5 2 3 proof of corollaries 1 9 and 1 10 corollary 1 9 follows from theorem 1 8 thanks to the following result corollary 5 12 of 26 lemma 2 13 let k be an algebraically closed field of character istic p 0 and let g be a reductive k group assume that p h g let h g be an infinitesimally saturated group then the following equalities hold true radp h x rad h x is p nilpotent x radp lie hred x is p nilpotent radp lie hred radu h 0 red proof let us note that the assumptions of lemma 2 8 are satisfied here as 1 the unipotent radical of h 0 red is normal in h and the quotient h h 0 red is a group of multiplicative type according to 2 theorem 2 5 because h is infinitesimally satu rated 2 the characteristic is always as requested in the statement of the lemma because we assume the characteristic p to be greater than h g this can be checked with table 1 by making use of the identity lie h 0 red lie hred we obtain the desired equalities proof of corollary 1 9 the normaliser of u is infinitesimally saturated according to lemma 5 1 because p h g corollary 5 12 thus ensures that u is a subalgebra of ng u given by the set of all p nilpotent elements of rad ng u theorem 1 8 thus holds true and allows to conclude remark 5 13 to show corollary 1 9 one needs to combine theorem 1 8 with proposition 5 12 this in particular underlines that when k is of characteristic p 0 the p radical of a lie algebra that derives from a reductive k group is really the good analogue of the nilradical of a semisimple lie algebra in characteristic 0 nevertheless a much simpler proof is possible by making use of the exponential map as defined in 26 proposition 3 1 by definition the p radical of ng u is a p nil p ideal according to 26 proposition 3 1 the ideal 23 u can be integrated into a unipotent smooth connected subgroup u g by construction u is normal in ng u 0 red and this normal subgroup is thus necessarily contained into the unipotent radical of ng u 0 red denoted by v the inclusion being preserved by derivation this leads to the following inclusion of lie algebras u v according to lemma 5 2 the group ng u is infinitesimally saturated the subgroups v and ng u 0 red are therefore normal in ng u see 2 theorem 2 5 thus v is an ideal of lie ng u as the normalisers ng u and ng u are equal according to lemma 5 6 we actually have shown that lie ng u lie ng u ng u where the last equality is ensured by lemma 2 7 the lie algebra of v is therefore a p nil p ideal of ng u according to 26 lemma 2 12 it is thus necessarily contained in radp ng u which is the lie algebra u itself by assumption in other words we have shown the equality u v whence the equality of the smooth connected groups u and v by making use of 13 ii 5 5 5 as in the proof of theorem 1 8 veisfeiler borel tits theorem see 5 corollaire 3 2 allows us to conclude the proof of corollary 1 10 is now immediate proof of corollary 1 10 by n therianity of g there exists an integer i for which the se quences ui i n and qi i n of the statement stabilise let us denote by u respectively q the limit objects according to corollary 5 12 as ng u is infinitesimally saturated see lemma 5 1 the lie algebra u is the p radical of its normaliser ng u according to corollary 1 10 this normaliser is a parabolic subalgebra of g the aforementioned corollary ensures that this algebra derives from the subgroup p u obtained by applying veisfeiler borel tits theorem see 5 corollaire 3 2 to the group u that integrates u this parabolic subalgebra is also the lie algebra of the optimal parabolic subgroup of u denoted by pg u corollary 1 10 allows us to show corollary 5 14 below corollary 5 14 of theorem 1 8 let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p 0 and let g be a reductive k group assume that p h g let q g be a maximal proper restricted p lie subalgebra then q is either p reductive or parabolic proof let u radp q there are two possibilities 1 either u 0 and so q is p reductive 2 or u 6 0 in this case let us note that the inclusion q ng u is satisfied and that q is maximal by assumption there are again two possibilities i either ng u g which is impossible because g is p reductive so has no non trivial p nil p ideal ii or ng u q in this case as p h g corollary 1 10 allows us to conclude that ng u is the lie algebra of a parabolic subgroup of g 5 2 4 proof of corollary 1 15 corollary 1 15 allows to bridge together theorem 1 8 and section 7 we assume here that g is endowed with a symmetric non degenerate g equivariant bilinear form denoted by under this assumption and according to 41 i 8 corollary the lie algebra g is semisimple proof let us first show that p ng p let x p and y p for any z p the following vanishing condition x y z y z x 0 is satisfied in other words x y p and p is a subalgebra of ng p now remark that p is contained in nil ng p as p is a nilpotent ideal of ng p it is thus orthogonal to ng p according to 8 4 n 3 proposition 4 d in other words the inclusion p ng p holds true because is non degenerate this leads to obtain the inclusion ng p p thus the equality p ng p according to 1 9 as p is a subalgebra of g by assumption one only needs to show that p radp ng p to conclude this is clear according to remark 2 9 and what precedes as by assumption g is semisimple and we just have shown that p nil p 24 6 analogue of morozov theorem in separably good char acteristics in this section k is an algebraically closed field of characteristic p 0 and g is a reductive k group we aim to show here that morozov theorem admits an analogue when p is separably good for g and under an extra assumption on normalisers which is explained below this condition is by far less restrictive than the one required in theorem 1 8 more precisely in this section we prove theorem 1 12 and corollaries 1 14 and 1 13 as mentioned in the introduction of this article when p is separably good for g not all restricted p nil p subalgebra u g can be integrated into a unipotent smooth connected subgroup of g moreover even if this integration exists nothing ensures that it would be compatible with the adjoint representation the results stated in this section therefore require to impose an additional condition on the normaliser of ng u to settle these issues the proofs of the aforementioned results reproduce and adapt arguments developed in section 5 in which we assumed p h g obtaining such statements required the existence of a unipotent smooth connected subgroup of g which integrates u this condition does not always hold true as illustrated in 26 section 3 3 however assuming p to be separably good for g ensures the existence of a springer isomorphism nred g vred g and allows us to lift nilpotent elements of g to unipotent elements of g this is detailed for instance in 26 section 3 1 this punctual integration induces for any p nilpotent element x g a morphism called t power map x ga g t 7 tx this combined with the fppf formalism developed in 14 vib proposition 7 1 leads to associate to any restricted p nil p subalgebra v g a unipotent smooth connected subgroup jv this group can be huge in general but when the subalgebra v is as in statement 1 1 i have showed in 26 lemma 5 1 that the subgroup jv actually integrates v as mentioned in the introduction the lack of smoothness of normalisers is another issue specific to the characteristic p 0 framework under the assumption p h g we have shown that any normaliser of any restricted p nil p lie subalgebra is infinitesimally saturated see lemma 5 1 this allowed us to make use of 2 theorem 2 5 to settle the lack of smoothness of normalisers to show this property was satisfied we made use of a structure theorem for unipotent groups this was possible in this context because any restricted p nil p subalgebra v g was integrable into a unipotent smooth connected subgroup v g as explained in introduction the notion of infinitesimal saturation naturally extends in separably good characteristics to that of infinitesimal saturation where nred g vred g is a springer isomorphism for g this allows us to obtain a variation of a result of p deligne see 26 theorem 1 1 and proposition 4 12 however the difficulty raised in this paragraph is only partially settled here as we are missing the existence of an integration of any restricted p nil p lie subalgebra of g when p h g this prevents us from using the aforementioned structural argument useful in the proof of lemma 5 1 and justifies the additional assumption in the statement of theorem 1 12 with respect to the statement in characteristic p h g 6 1 proof of theorem 1 12 let us remind the reader of the notations of theorem 1 12 in what follows k is an alge braically closed field of characteristic p 0 and g is a reductive k group the characteristic p is assumed to be separably good for g let u g be a restricted p subalgebra such that u is the set of p nilpotent elements of rad ng u proof of theorem 1 12 the proof is the same as the one of the analogue of morozov theo rem in characteristic p h g see theorem 1 8 according to 26 lemma 5 1 the restricted p nil p lie algebra u integrates into a unipotent smooth connected subgroup ju g and we aim to show that ng u pg ju let us note that this directly implies the smoothness of ng u 0 because a parabolic subgroup is smooth see 15 xxvi d finition 1 1 according to section 4 and in particular the equivalent conditions 2 and 3 of theorem 1 6 what precedes is equivalent to require the equality ng u pg u to hold true 25 as by assumption the subgroupng u is infinitesimally saturated and satisfies hypothe ses of 26 theorem 1 1 the connected component of its reduced part ng u 0 red is normal in ng u in particular if ng u 0 red is a parabolic subgroup of g then one has ng u ng u 0 red because a parabolic subgroup is its own normaliser see 15 xxii corollaire 5 8 5 this is thus enough to show that ng u 0 red is a parabolic subgroup of g according to 26 lemma 3 5 the normalisers ng u and ng ju are equal so are the connected components of their reduced parts hence one only needs to show that ng ju 0 red is a reduced parabolic subgroup of g when p h g we made use of veisfeiler borel tits theorem 5 corollaire 3 2 to show the equality ng ju 0 red pg ju let v radu ng ju 0 red one then needs to show that ng ju 0 red ng v 0 red the subgroup ju is is actually contained in the unipotent radical of ng ju 0 red because it is a unipotent smooth connected normal subgroup of ng ju 0 red according to the preamble of 26 section 3 2 thus ju v whence the inclusion of lie algebras ju v finally let us note that the unipotent subgroup v is normal in ng u according to 26 theorem 1 1 because by assumption ng u ng ju is infinitesimally saturated the lie algebra of v is therefore a p nil p ideal of ng u according to 26 lemma 2 12 the situation is hence the following v radp ng u u lie ju where we make use of 26 lemma 2 5 because u is the set of p nilpotent elements of rad ng u let us note that the last equality is ensured by 26 lemma 5 1 which ensures that the subgroup ju integrates u as a conclusion we have shown that v ju the subgroups v and ju are smooth connected and their lie algebras are equal so they are according to 13 ii 5 5 5 thus the subgroup v is the unipotent radical of its smooth and connected normaliser the latter is hence the parabolic subgroup pg ju g obtained by applying veisfeiler borel tits theorem 5 corollaire 3 2 remarks 6 1 the proof of theorem 1 12 allows to state the two following remarks 1 the assumption of infinitesimal saturation a priori ensures that the smooth connected part of ng u contains a torus let us stress out that this is a necessary condition for the statement to hold true indeed let h ng u be a maximal connected subgroup of multiplicative type and assume that ng u 0 red does not contain any torus then the intersection h ng u 0 red is non trivial and ng u 0 red is unipotent the unipotency of ng u 0 red can indeed be deduced from the maximality of h that ensures that ng u 0 red has no factors of type p to conclude we use that k is algebraically closed so we have the equality ju ng u 0 red in the proof of theorem 1 12 in other words ng u 0 red is both parabolic and unipotent which is absurd 2 moreover the infinitesimal version of 2 theorem 2 5 obtained in 26 proposition 4 14 already allowed us to show an infinitesimal version of theorem 1 12 stated below proposition 6 2 let k be an algebraically closed field and g be a reductive k group assume that p is separably good for g and let nred g vred g be a springer isomorphism for g let u g be a restricted p subalgebra and assume that 1 the subalgebra u is the set of all p nilpotent elements of the normaliser of g 2 the normaliser ng u is infinitesimally saturated then the normaliser ng u g is a parabolic lie subalgebra proof the restricted p nil p subalgebra u g of the statement integrates into a unipotent smooth connected subgroup ju g according to 26 lemma 3 5 the normalisers ng u and ng ju are equal let v be the unipotent radical of ng u the subgroup ju is unipotent smooth connected and normal inng u thus inng u 0 red it is moreover contained in the unipotent radical of the latter in other words the inclusion ju v is satisfied and one only needs to get the reverse inclusion once again and as the groups involved here are smooth and connected this can be checked on their lie algebras see 13 ii 5 n 5 5 according to 26 lemma 2 12 the lie algebra v is a restricted p nil p subalgebra of ng u as ng u 0 is infinitesimally saturated the lie algebra v is an ideal of lie ng u ng u according to the second point of 26 proposition 4 14 in other words v is a p nil p ideal of ng u thus is contained in u which is nothing but the set of all p nilpotent elements of the radical of ng u according to 26 lemma 2 5 hence ju v is the unipotent radical of its smooth connected normaliser according to 5 corollaire 3 2 this normaliser is the parabolic subgroup pg ju g moreover recall that u is the lie algebra of the unipotent radical of a parabolic subgroup it is therefore the lie algebra of the unipotent radical of 26 the optimal parabolic subgroup associated to it and obtained in section 4 via the hilbert mumford kempf rousseau method in other words we have shown that pg u pg ju whence the infinitesimal version of theorem 1 12 remark 6 3 when g is of type ra 26 proposition 4 14 is even enough to show the strong version of morozov theorem 1 12 we detail the reasoning here let us also emphasize that in practice this assumption together with the additional assumption of separably good characteristic amounts to avoid factors of type apm 1 in the decomposition of g in order to simplify the notations we set p pg ju so p pg ju g assume g to be of type ra then any of its parabolic subgroups q g is such that q ng q 0 according to 15 xxii proposition 5 3 4 in other words the situation is the following pe ng u ng p lie ng p 0 by virtue of the first point of 26 proposition 4 14 this leads to the following inequalities dim p dim p dim ng u dim ng u dim ng p 0 dim p and allows us to conclude that pg ju ng u 0 red ng u the equality ng u pg u follows as explained in the above proof 6 2 proofs of corollaries 1 13 and 1 14 the preceding paragraphs aimed to adapt techniques and notions developed when p h g to separably good characteristics this work being done proofs of corollaries 1 13 and 1 14 will be the same as those of corollaries 1 9 and 1 10 in particular corollary 1 13 follows from theorem 1 12 thanks to the following result corollary 6 4 of 26 lemma 2 14 let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p 0 and let g be a reductive k group assume that p is separably good for g and let nred g vred g be a springer isomorphism for g let h g be a infinitesimally saturated group then the following equalities hold true radp h x rad h x is p nilpotent x radp lie hred x is p nilpotent radp lie hred radu h 0 red proof let us note that assumptions of lemma 2 8 are satisfied here indeed 1 the unipotent radical of h 0 red is normal in h and the quotient h h 0 red is a group of multiplicative type according to 26 theorem 1 1 because h is infinitesimally satu rated 2 the characteristic is always as requested in the statement of lemma 2 8 as p is assumed to be separably good for g this can be checked with table 1 by making use of the identity lie h 0 red lie hred we obtain the desired equalities proof of corollary 1 13 note that the main point here was to obtain corollary 6 4 above the proof of the corollary is now exactly the same as the proof of corollary 1 9 the proof of corollary 1 14 is now immediate proof of corollary 1 14 let us consider the towers of the statement and denote by u re spectively q the limit objects as by assumption the normaliser ng u is infinitesimally saturated the proof of corollary 1 13 allows us to identify the lie algebra u with the p radical of its normaliser ng u according to corollary 1 14 this normaliser is a parabolic lie subalgebra of g the same statement ensures that it derives from a subgroup p u obtained by applying veisfeiler borel tits theorem see 5 corollaire 3 2 to the group u that integrates u it is also the lie algebra of the parabolic subgroup optimal for u denoted by pg u 27 remark 6 5 in section 5 we obtained a classical corollary of the analogue of morozov theorem when p h g see corollary 5 14 when p is separably good for g obtaining such a result is no longer that easy the main issue here is that the integration of a restricted p nil lie algebra does no longer always exist this prevents us from obtaining that the normalisers in g of p nil subalgebras are infinitesimally saturated nevertheless one could expect that the maximality condition on q would force the involved normalisers to be infinitesimally saturated 7 an application characterisation of the canonical parabolic subgroup of a reductive group 7 1 canonical parabolic subgroup in what follows we use the language of 15 in particular the theory we refer to is the one of reductive groups over an arbitrary basis let us remind the reader of some conventions a group scheme g over a basis s is reductive if it is affine and smooth over s with connected and reductive fibres see 15 xix d finition 2 7 a definition of borel subgroups in this framework can be found in 15 xxii exemples 5 2 3 a see also 15 xxvi d finition 1 1 for a definition of parabolic subgroups a reference for the study of the scheme of automorphisms of a group scheme is 15 xxiv let k be a field and c be a smooth geometrically connected projective k curve in 3 k a behrend defines the notion of the canonical parabolic subgroup of a reductive c group g which is the twisted form of a constant c group g 0 see 3 definition 5 6 the author shows that such a group has a unique canonical parabolic subgroup denoted by p cang it is the maximal element for the inclusion of the set of parabolic subgroups of g whose degree is the degree of instability of g see theorem 7 3 and definition 4 4 ibid as a reminder see definition 4 1 and note 4 2 ibid the degree of a smooth connected c group is the degree of its lie algebra seen as a c vector bundle the degree of a reductive group is thus always equal to 0 the parabolic subgroup defined by the author generalises that of g as defined by m atiyah and r bott in 1 10 when k is of characteristic 0 let us set u cang radu p can g as mentioned in the introduction when p 2 dim g 2 and under the above assumptions on g theorem 1 8 allows to provide a new proof that the definition of m atiyah and r bott still make sense in characteristic p 0 in this framework the parabolic subgroups obtained respectively by k a behrend in 3 theorem 7 3 and that are always defined and by m atiyah and r bott in 1 10 that is defined only for p 0 or p 2 dim g 2 coincide this is the point of this section let v be a vector bundle over a curve c as a reminder the slope of v denoted by v is the quotient deg v rank v where deg v and rank v are respectively the degree and the rank of the vector bundle v let us in particular underline that v is of positive respectively negative slope if and only if v has positive respectively negative degree any vector bundle over a curve admits a harder narasimhan filtration see 18 1 3 9 that is a filtration by vector subbundles such that the successive quotient are semistable with strictly decreasing slope let us denote by min v respectively max v the minimum respectively the maximum of slopes of the successive quotients that occur in this filtration in order to avoid heavy notations we denote by p p cang the canonical parabolic subgroup of g by i the type of p and by p 0 the parabolic subgroup of g 0 from which p is a twisted form the couple eg 0 ep 0 p 0 naturally identifies with g p where e is the aut g 0 p 0 k torsor isom g 0 p 0 g p and ep 0 is its restriction to p 0 see 15 expos xxiv in particular corollary 2 2 this restriction of structure is said to be canonical see 3 8 as well as the preamble and lemma 4 of 19 the associated p 0 radu p 0 torsor is thus semi stable this means that the reductive group p radu p it defines is semistable as a reminder a reductive k group h is semistable if any parabolic subgroup q h is of negative or 0 degree see 3 definition 4 4 28 let us go back to our notations the lie algebra g eg 0 is a vector bundle over c it thus admits a harder narasimhan filtration 0 e r e r 1 e 1 e 0 e 1 el g where the indices are chosen in such a way that the slopes ei ei 1 are non positive for 0 i l and the slopes e i e i 1 are positive for 1 i r 1 the following lemma allows a first comparison between pcang and e 0 its proof requires to compare the semi stability of a h 0 torsor and that of the vector bundle it induces for h 0 a constant c group this is the point of 22 theorem 3 1 when h 0 is semisimple the general case of a reductive group when the connected component of the center of h 0 acts by homothetie is detailed in 4 proposition 6 9 lemma 7 1 when p 2 h g 2 the lie algebra of the canonical parabolic subgroup as defined by k a behrend satisfies the inclusion pcang e 0 proof as previously mentioned the p 0 radu p 0 torsor induced by p 0 is semistable be cause p is the canonical parabolic subgroup of g eg 0 let us remark that one has h g 0 h g and h p 0 h p this comes from the definition of the coxeter number see subsections 2 1 and 2 3 let us moreover note that 4 proposition 6 9 holds true because when p 2 h g 2 the adjoint representation ad p 0 radu p 0 gl p 0 radu p 0 is of low height see remark 5 9 therefore the induced vector bundle pcang radu p cang is semistable it is thus of degree 0 because the quotient p radu p is reductive so min pcang 0 as by construction max g e 0 e 1 e 0 e 0 e 1 0 the only possible morphism between pcang and g e 0 is the trivial morphism in other words the inclu sion pcang e 0 holds true the main point of this section is to determine some conditions under which the equality e 0 pcang is satisfied a first criterion is obtained by making additional assumptions on the slopes of the successive quotients of the harder narasimhan filtrations of both radu p cang and g pcang proposition 7 2 when p 2 h g 2 if 1 the harder narasimhan filtration of ucang admits successive quotients whose slopes are strictly positive 2 the harder narasimhan filtration of g pcang admits successive quotients of strictly neg ative slopes then e 0 is the lie algebra of p cang while e 1 is that of u can g proof in order to avoid heavy notations we set u radu p cang and u u can g by assumption one has min u 0 and the equality max g e 1 e 0 e 1 0 holds true thus the only possible morphism between u and g e 1 is the trivial one therefore we have shown the inclusion u e 1 by assumption g p admits a filtration by semistable quotients of strictly negative slope as p is the canonical parabolic subgroup of g for the same reasons as the one involved in proof of lemma 7 1 the quotient p u is semistable and of slope 0 hence the equality max g u p u 0 as by construction min e 1 e 1 e 2 e 1 e 0 0 the only possible morphism between e 1 and g u is trivial whence the equality u e 1 to summarise the situation is as follows e 2 e 1 u p e 0 e 1 and it remains to show that p e 0 by assumption the slopes of the harder narasimhan filtration of g p are strictly negative so max g p 0 as one has u e 1 the quotient p u is a subbundle of e 0 e 1 which is semistable in other words the inequality p u e 0 e 1 is satisfied the quotient p u is of slope 0 because it is of degree 0 as the slope e 0 e 1 is not positive by construction the following vanishing condition is actually satisfied min e 0 e 0 e 1 0 the only possible morphism between e 0 and g p is therefore the trivial morphism so we have shown that e 0 p when g is endowed with a non degenerate symmetric g equivariant bilinar form the harder narasimhan filtration of g has a very specific shape namely 29 lemma 7 3 under the above assumptions the harder narasimhan filtration of g is such that l r 1 and e i e i 1 for all 1 i r proof if is non degenerate then g g and the harder narasimhan filtration of g is given by 0 e r e 1 e 0 e 1 e l g where e i g ei l r 1 if 0 i r and e i g e i l r 1 if 0 i l indeed the bundle e r g el 1 is semistable because g el 1 is this is the first quotient of the harder narasimhan filtration of g the quotient e i e i 1 is isomorphic to ei l r ei l r 1 by application of snake lemma therefore e i e i 1 is semistable for all 0 i r the same reasoning holds for any 0 i l as one can show on the same way that e i e i 1 is isomorphic to e i l r 1 ei l r the preceding isomorphisms ensure the desired strictness of the inequalities for slopes the equalities g g and e i e i e ei 1 e i 1 then follow from the uniqueness of the harder narasimhan filtration remark 7 4 lemma 7 3 allows us to remark that under the conditions of proposition 1 16 the slopes of the harder narasimhan filtration of g pcang g e 0 are strictly negative and those of the harder narasimhan de ucang are strictly positive in other words the assumptions required at proposition 1 16 implie those of proposition 7 2 as mentioned in the introduction when k is of characteristic 0 the equality e 0 p is proven in 1 10 given a constant reductive group g 0 over a k curve c atiyah bott definition was actually the definition of the canonical parabolic subgroup of a g 0 torsor g before k a behrend s work so such an object was at first only defined in characteristic 0 in characteristic p 0 the equality e 0 p is given by v b mehta in 37 theorem 2 6 when p 2 dim g see also the paper of v b mehta et s subramanian 36 proposition 3 4 when p max 2 dimg 4 h g 1 and by a langer in 30 proposition 3 3 when e admits a strong harder narasimhan filtration see 30 definition 3 1 this last condition is in particular satisfied when p 3 and the minimal slope of the tangent bundle of x is strictly positive see 30 corollary 6 4 and 36 theorem 4 1 theorem 1 8 allows us to show the equality of proposition 7 2 and provides a new proof for it when p 2 dim g 2 by mimicking the one already known in characteristic 0 remark 7 5 some of the results stated in the article of v balaji p deligne and a j parameswaran 2 already allow to show proposition 7 2 when g admits an almost faithful representation of low height and p h g this amounts to require p 2 h g 2 if g is simple and allows to show 36 proposition 3 4 without the additional assumption p 4 h g 1 this assumption allowed the authors to make use of a result of j p serre coming from representation theory to reduce the proof to the case g gln 7 2 proof of proposition 1 16 let us remind the reader of the notations of this section in what follows and unless otherwise stated k is a field and c is a projective smooth and geometrically connected k curve we denote by k its function field whose algebraic closure is denoted by k let g be a reductive c group which is the twisted form of a constant c group g 0 and assume that g is endowed with a non degenerate killing form let us moreover denote by p the canonical parabolic subgroup ofg as defined by k a behrend in 3 theorem 7 3 by p 0 the parabolic subgroup of g from which p is a twisted form by e the aut g 0 p 0 c torsor isom g 0 p 0 g p and by ep 0 its restriction to p 0 30 the lie algebra g eg 0 seen as a vector bundle over c admits a harder narasimhan filtration 0 e r e r 1 e 1 e 0 e 1 el g where the indices are chosen such that ei ei 1 0 for 0 i l and e i e i 1 0 for 1 i r 1 according to lemma 7 3 any factor of the filtration satisfies e i e i 1 because g is endowed with a non degenerate killing form the proof of proposition 1 16 requires to show that 1 the factor e 0 is a lie subalgebra of g and the factor e 1 is a nilpotent ideal of e 0 let us note that a priori one would have to show that e 1 is actually p nil but the assumption of the existence of a non degenerate bilinear form on g guarantees the equivalence between p nilpotency and ad nilpotency see remark 2 9 2 the factor e 0 derives from a parabolic subgroup of g to prove the first point we make use of results that ensure a compatibility between the tensor product and the semi stability of its factors we then need corollary 1 15 to prove the second point as this result allows us to show on the generic geometric fibre that e 0 k is a parabolic subalgebra 7 2 1 semi stability of tensor products the point of this paragraph is to show 1 that e 0 is a subalgebra of g 2 that e 1 is a nilpotent ideal of e 0 3 the third point of proposition 1 16 we start by showing the following lemma lemma 7 6 when p 2 dimg 2 for any couple of indices r i j l in the above harder narasimhan filtration of g the slope identity min ei ej min ei min ej is satisfied proof this is a direct consequence of the following results 1 if k is of characteristic 0 the tensor product of semistable c vector bundles v 1 and v 2 is still semistable and of slope v 1 v 2 see 1 lemma 10 1 see also 32 theorem 6 the result extends to k non algebraically closed 2 if k is a field of characteristic p 0 let v 1 and v 2 be two semistable c vector bundles and assume that p 2 rank v 1 rank v 2 then the vector bundle v 1 v 2 is still semistable of slope v 1 v 2 see 22 remark 3 4 and 32 theorem 8 this lemma allows us to show that e 0 is a subalgebra of g let us consider the lie bracket e 0 e 0 g g e 0 where we made use of the isomorphism g g because is non degenerate as e 1 e 0 g e 0 according to lemma 7 3 the degree of e 1 satisfies deg e 1 deg g deg e 0 deg e 0 where the last equality is induced by the fact that deg g 0 so one actually has obtained the vanishing condition min e 0 e 0 e 1 0 moreover according to lemma 7 6 min e 0 e 0 min e 0 min e 0 0 and max g e 0 e 1 e 0 e 0 e 1 0 this implies that the morphism is necessarily trivial the vector bundle e 0 is thus a lie algebra bundle this kind of reasoning also allow to show that e 1 is a nilpotent ideal of g for any 0 j r let us consider the bracket e 1 e j g e j 1 31 with the convention that e r 1 0 as by assumption p 2 dimg 2 we have that min e 1 e j min e 1 min e j e 1 e 2 e j e j 1 e j e j 1 max e 0 e j 1 because e 1 e 2 e 0 e 1 0 indeed the morphism is necessarily trivial thus e 1 e j e j 1 for any 0 j and e 1 is a nilpotent ideal of e 0 in order to show the third point of proposition 1 16 we once again consider the following lie bracket for any 0 i r e i e 0 e 0 e i because min e 0 e i min e 0 min e i e 0 e 1 e i e i 1 max e 0 e i e i 1 e i as e 0 e 1 0 and e i e i 1 e i 1 e i by assumption the morphism is therefore necessarily trivial and e i is an ideal of e 0 nilpotent because so is e 1 remark 7 7 the key point of the preceding proof is the equality min e 0 e 0 min e 0 min e 0 0 which is satisfied when p 2 ranke 0 2 this condition and more generally the condition of compatibility between the stability of vector bundles and their tensor products is ensured in the articles of v b mehta and s subramanian 36 and v b mehta 37 by the assumption p 2 dim g 7 2 2 consequences of corollary 1 15 corollary 1 15 allows us to show that e 0 is a parabolic subalgebra of g this is the second part of the first point of proposition 1 16 it moreover provides a characterisation of such on the geometric fibres in terms of the instability parabolic subgroup of e 1 this is the point of the second point of the aforementioned proposition as g is a reductive group the lie bracket on gk comes from the lie bracket on g as a reminder and according to lemma 7 3 the ideal e 1 is the orthogonal of e 0 for the killing form on g thus we have e 1 k e 1 c spec k e 0 k e 0 k and e 1 is a nil ideal of e 0 k according to corollary 1 15 the subalgebra e 0 k gk is thus a parabolic subalgebra of gk it derives from a parabolic subgroup q of gk according to 15 xxii corollaire 5 3 4 we have that q ngk e 0 k 0 because gk is of type ra as p 2 dim g 2 2 h 2 the morphism g gad is separable this in particular implies the smoothness of the involved normaliser let us show that this parabolic subgroup is actually defined over k as e 0 is defined over c thus over k we can consider the normaliser ngk e 0 k which is representable accord ing to 13 ii 1 n 3 th or me 3 6 b the equality ngk e 0 k 0 ngk e 0 k 0 k k holds true according to 13 ii 1 n 3 as ngk e 0 k 0 is in particular smooth the situa tion is compatible with base change so we have that e 0 k k k e 0 k lie q lie ngk e 0 k 0 lie ngk e 0 k 0 k k in other words e 0 k is the lie algebra of a smooth subgroup of gk with parabolic geometric fibre thus of a parabolic subgroup by definition see 15 xxvi d finition 1 1 the latter extends on a unique way to a parabolic subgroup q g over c because the scheme of parabolic subgroups of g is projective see 15 expos xxvi corollaire 3 5 it remains to show that lie q e 0 as a reminder two oc submodules of g el er 1 that are locally direct factors are equals if they are geometrically the same this allows us to conclude because one has the following generic identity grasss n e 0 c grasss n e 0 k subvector bundles of rank n of e 0 c k 32 which is ensured by the projectivity of the s scheme grasss n e 0 obtained for example in 28 definition 1 7 1 et remarks 1 7 5 let us remark that grasss n e 0 is well defined as e 0 is a locally direct factor so is any factor of the above harder narasimhan filtration by assumption see also 7 planches the characteristic of k satisfies p 2 dim g 2 h g 1 according to lemma 7 1 one thus has p e 0 q and e 1 radu q that allows us to obtain the inclusions e 1 radu p p e 0 the quotient e 0 e 1 is semi stable hence p e 1 e 0 e 1 q radu q 0 and thus deg p deg e 1 deg q the parabolic subgroup p is the canonical parabolic subgroup of g therefore it is maximal among the parabolic subgroups of g of maximal degree see 3 theorem 7 3 hence the equality p q this leads to the equality of lie algebras e 0 p and e 1 u and ends the proof of the first point finally according to corollary 1 15 the equality qk q pgk p k holds on the generic geometric fibre this settles the proof of the second point of proposition 1 16 remark 7 8 if g is split over x let t g be a maximal torus of g and denote by tk gk q the maximal subtorus obtained by base change according to 15 xxv corollaire 1 3 there exists a triple tz qz gz that provides a triple tk qk q gk after base change for any group of multiplicative type h let us denote by x h the group of cocharacters of h let q 0 p k x tz be an indivisible cocharacter of the intersection it defines a parabolic subgroup pgz such that q pg et pg k pgk p k if g is not split the same reasoning is still valid locally as g is a twisted form of a constant group thus g can be pinned acknowledgements the author would like to thank philippe gille for his precious help his availability his patience and all the fruitful conversations they had beno
