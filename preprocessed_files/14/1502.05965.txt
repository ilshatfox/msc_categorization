complex algebraic variety x we show that triviality of the sheaf co homology group h 0 x h 3 occurring on the second page of the bloch ogus spectral sequence 1 follows from a condition on the integral chow group ch 2 x and the integral cohomology group h 3 x z in the case that x is an appropriate approximation to the classifying stack bg of a finite p group g this result states that the group g has no degree three cohomological invariants as a corollary we show that the nonabelian groups of order p 3 for odd prime p have no degree three cohomological invariants keywords algebraic geometry cohomological invariant motivic cohomology chow ring 2010 msc 14 c 15 14 f 42 20 g 10 1 introduction let g be a finite p group of order pn considered as an algebraic group over c in this paper we employ the tools of the bloch ogus spectral sequence and the motivic cohomology ring of the classifying space bg in order to examine in detail the relationship between the chow ring of g and the ring of cohomological invariants of g in low degree in particular our main result is that if the cycle class map cl ch 2 g h 4 bg z is an isomorphism then there are no non trivial degree three cohomological invariants of g there has been a lot of progress recently in computing the university of maryland college park email address rblack 1 math umd edu rebecca black preprint submitted to journal of pure and applied algebra january 11 2021 http arxiv org abs 1502 05965 v 2 chow rings of various classes of p groups so we know that we have this isomorphism in certain cases see for example for an excellent overview of recent progress ideally similar techniques could be employed to explicitly relate the chow ring to vanishing of invariants in higher degree as well but a more detailed computational understanding of the motivic cohomology of g is necessary to extend this method to higher degrees 2 chow groups and cohomological invariants totaro defines the chow groups of the groupg in terms of finite dimensional approximations to the classifying stack bg suppose that v is a representa tion of g and let s v be the locus on which the stabilizers are non trivial with codims d let x v s g be the quotient variety then ch ig ch ix for i d totaro proved the existence of a sequence of such representations vn with the codimension of sn going to infinity see 7 for a good exposition throughout this paper we will freely assume that we have a variety x of this form where we have taken the representation to be of high enough dimension that x has the same invariants and cohomology as g in low dimensions a cohomological invariant of g is a natural transformation of functors h 1 g h z p where h 1 k g is the first nonabelian galois cohomology set which can be thought of as isomorphism classes of g torsors over k and h k z p is the abelian galois cohomology ring for our purposes however this is not the most convenient way to think of cohomological invariants given a quo tient variety x v s g as above with codims 2 the generic fiber t of the map v s x is a versal g torsor meaning that any given cohomo logical invariant is actually completely defined by its value on that specific torsor see discussion in 4 since t is defined over spec k x its image under an invariant will lie in the galois cohomology group hd k x z p for some degree d hence we can identify the group of degree d cohomological invariants of g with a certain subset of hd k x z p in fact we can say much more about that certain subset given a point x x with codim x 1 we get a residue map x h d k x z p hd 1 k x z p 2 where k x is the stalk at x if a class t h d k x z p is the image of a versal torsor under an invariant then x t 0 for all such x conversely totaro shows that if codims 2 every class in the kernel of x for all x does in fact define a cohomological invariant letter to serre reprinted in 3 therefore we have the identification invdg ker hd k x z p x x 1 hd 1 k x z p where x x 1 ranges over all codimension one points 3 bloch ogus spectral sequence and stable cohomology in their 1974 paper bloch and ogus showed that the product of residue maps considered above is part of a flasque resolution of the sheaf hd on x defined as the sheafification of the zariski presheaf u 7 hde t u z p therefore we can actually think of the kernel as a sheaf cohomology group and we get invdg h 0 x hd this sheaf cohomology group appears as the e 0 d 2 term of the bloch ogus spectral sequence forx which converges to the e tale cohomologyh e t x z p with our assumptions on x and the base field k we can in fact identify these e tale cohomology groups with the group cohomology h g z p in low de gree the diagonal entries e r r 2 are isomorphic to the mod p chow groups chrx z p chrg z p hence the differential e 0 3 2 e 2 2 2 combined with the maps to and from the abutment give an exact sequence h 3 g z p inv 3 g ch 2 g z p h 4 g z p our basic plan of attack is to show that both the kernel and the image of are trivial which forces inv 3 g 0 triviality of the image will follow immediately from the assumption on the integral chow groups since the map to h 4 g z p coincides with the mod p cycle class map we will have to work a bit harder to show that the kernel is trivial the kernel of is precisely the classes that survive to the group cohomology also known as the stable cohomology as discussed in 2 hence the vanishing of this kernel 3 is equivalent to the vanishing of degree three stable cohomology which is shown for several cases of p groups in 2 we will use a somewhat different argument that makes use of the relationship of the sheaf cohomology groups hr x hs with the motivic cohomology ring h x z p 4 motivic cohomology this section summarizes a few important properties of the motivic coho mology ring h x z p associated to a variety x we do not attempt a complete discussion of the definition of this ring here see for example for details the beauty of the motivic cohomology ring for us is that it specializes for certain indices to both the mod p chow groups and the e tale cohomology groups specifically voevodsky and others have shown the following for a projective variety x hm n x z p 0 if m 2 n chnx z p if m 2 n hme t x z p if m n let denote a generator of h 0 1 spec k z p z p then the cup product gives a map hm n x z p hm n 1 x z p our argument makes use of the following long exact sequence which relates this map to the sheaf cohomology groups that appear in the bloch ogus spectral sequence see 8 hm n 1 x z p hm n x z p hm n x hn hm 1 n 1 x z p finally we will also use the fact that there is motivic cohomology with integer coefficients as well and in particular there is an isomorphism h 2 n n x z ch nx 5 main theorem we are now ready to state and prove our main result on the vanishing of degree three cohomological invariants theorem 5 1 let x be a variety over specc satisfying the following two properties 4 i ch 2 x h 4 x z ii there is some power pn with pnh 3 x z 0 then h 0 x h 3 0 in particular if x is an approximation of the classi fying stack bg for an algebraic group g such that the above two conditions hold then inv 3 g 0 proof the group h 0 x h 3 fits into the following long exact sequence h 3 2 x z p h 3 3 x z p h 0 x h 2 h 4 2 x z p h 4 3 x z p therefore we get our result if we can show that a h 4 2 x z p h 4 3 x z p is injective b h 3 2 x z p h 3 3 x z p is surjective and the injectivity is easier to show so we will do that first we know that h 4 2 x z p ch 2 x z p is the mod p chow group the mod p cycle class map c ch 2 x z p h 4 x z p agrees with the change of coefficients map h 4 x z h 4 x z p induced by the short exact sequence 0 z z z p 0 meaning its kernel is exactly pch 2 x this shows that c is injective since we can identify c with the map 2 on motivic cohomology we have shown a for b denote by the connecting homomorphism h 3 x z p h 4 x z the plan of attack is first to show that ker im h 3 3 x z p h 3 x z p and then to show that any class in h 3 x z p is equivalent to ker mod the image of the key to the first step is that for any exponent n the short exact sequence 0 z p z pn 1 z pn 0 5 induces connecting maps on both e tale cohomology and motivic cohomology mot h x z pn h 1 x z p et h x z pn h 1 x z p under the isomorphisms from the beilinson lichntenbaum conjecture then et maps from h x z pn to h 1 1 x z p and we have that et mot therefore crucially for us im et im now let x ker h 3 x z p then we can pull x back to a class x h 3 x z by assumption h 3 x z is pn torsion for some n meaning that x in turn comes from a class x h 2 x z pn then we have x et x im as desired for the general case we now assume that x 6 0 h 4 x z re call that by assumption h 4 x z ch 2 x h 4 2 x z we write y h 4 2 x z for the image of x under this isomorphism since py 0 we have y x for some x h 3 2 x z p then x x h 4 x z where we abuse notation a bit by conflating x and its image under the isomorphism h 3 3 x z p h 3 x z p by the previous case then x x 0 so x x im therefore we also have x im as desired in the case that x v s g is an approximation to bg as described above with g pn we do automatically have that h 3 x z h 3 g z is pn torsion so the second condition of the theorem is automatically satisfied therefore we have shown that for finite p groups g if the degree two cycle class map is an isomorphism then g has no nontrivial degree three cohomo logical invariants for example yagita proved that the cycle class map is an isomorphism in all degrees for the two nonabelian groups of order p 3 for odd primes p 8 meaning by our result these groups have no cohomological invariants of degree three 6 acknowledgements infinite thanks to patrick brosnan for his help
