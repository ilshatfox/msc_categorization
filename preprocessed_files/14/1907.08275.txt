the purity conjecture in type c rachel karpman abstract a collection c of k element subsets of 1 2 m is weakly separated if for each i j c when the integers 1 2 m are arranged around a circle there is a chord separating i j from j i oh postnikov and speyer constructed a correspondence between weakly separated collections which are maximal by inclusion and reduced plabic graphs a class of networks defined by postnikov which give coordinate charts on the grassmannian of k planes in m space as a corollary they proved scott s purity conjecture which states that a weakly separated collection is maximal by inclusion if and only if it is maximal by size in this note we describe maximal weakly separated collections corresponding to symmetric plabic graphs which give coordinate charts on the lagrangian grassmannian and prove a symmetric version of the purity conjecture 1 introduction two k element subsets i and j of m 1 2 m are weakly separated if when the integers 1 2 m are arranged around a circle there is a chord separating i j from j i weak separation was first introduced by leclerc and zelevinsky in their study of quantum flag minors 5 in related work scott showed that a collection of k element subsets of m that are pairwise weakly separated has order at most k m k 1 and made the following purity conjecture a weakly separated collection of k elements subsets of m is maximal by inclusion if and only if it is maximal by size 9 weak separation plays an important role in the combinatorics of the grassmannian gr k m of k planes in m space concretely gr k m is the space of k m matrices modulo row operations the totally positive grassmannian gr 0 k m is the subset of gr k m where all k k matrix minors are positive in his celebrated paper 8 postnikov introduced a class of planar bicolored networks called plabic graphs and defined coordinate charts on gr 0 k m by assigning weights to the graphs edges scott gave a construction which assigns a k element subset of m to each face of a plabic graph for gr 0 k m 10 the matrix minors with columns indexed by these face labels give rational coordinates on gr k m which form a cluster in a cluster algebra structure on the affine coordinate ring of the grassmannian further the face labels of a plabic graph form a weakly separated collection which is maximal by size 10 oh postnikov and speyer proved scott s purity conjecture in 7 by showing that a weakly separated collection is maximal by inclusion if and only if it is the set of face labels of a plabic graph for gr 0 k m in 1 the author extended many results of 8 to the lagrangian grassmannian 2 n the space of maximal isotropic subspaces with respect to a symplectic form using symmetric plabic graphs a plabic graph is symmetric if reflection about a distinguished diameter leaves the uncolored graph unchanged but reverses the colors of vertices the author defined coordinate charts on the totally positive part 0 2 n of 2 n using postnikov s approach but did not consider face labels of symmetric plabic graphs the present paper aims to fill this gap date july 22 2019 1 ar x iv 1 90 7 08 27 5 v 1 m at h c o 1 8 ju l 20 19 2 rachel karpman after reviewing some combinatorial background we show in section 3 that the face labels of symmetric plabic graphs give rational coordinates on 2 n for an n element subset i of 2 n we define a set i which is the mirror image of i we call a weakly separated collection symmetric if i c for each i c in section 5 we prove that a plabic graph is symmetric if and only if its face labels form a symmetric weakly separated collection our main result states that if c is a symmetric weakly separated collection of n element subsets of 2 n the following are equivalent 1 c is maximal by inclusion among symmetric weakly separated collections 2 c is the set of face labels of a symmetric plabic graph for 0 2 n it follows that a symmetric weakly separated collection is maximal by inclusion if and only if it is maximal by size in fact we prove something stronger the totally nonnegative grassmannian gr 0 k m is the subset of gr k m where all k k minors are nonnegative as opposed to strictly positive postnikov gave a stratification of gr 0 k m by positroid cells defined in terms of vanishing minors the largest positroid cell is simply gr 0 k m plabic graphs may be defined for all positroid cells and face labellings of plabic graphs for lower dimensional cells are weakly sep arated collections which satisfy an additional condition and which are maximal by inclusion among all such collections 7 the totally nonnegative part of 2 n has an analogous strat ification with 0 2 n being the unique top dimensional cell and our results apply to these lower dimensional cells as well as to 0 2 n 2 background 2 1 intervals subsets and cyclic order on 1 2 m for natural numbers k m let m denote the set 1 2 m and let m k be the set of all k element subsets of m for a m let a denote the cyclic shift of the usual linear order on m given by 1 a a 1 m 1 a 1 we extend this to a partial order on m k by setting i a j for i i 1 a i 2 a a ik j j 1 a j 2 a a jk if i a j for all k for 1 this is the usual gale order on m k for a b m we define the cyclic interval a b cyc by 2 a b cyc a a 1 b a b a a 1 n 1 n 1 b a b note that if the elements of m are arranged clockwise around a circle then elements of a b are consecutive we say a sequence a 1 a 2 a of elements of m is cyclically ordered if when the integers 1 to m are arranged clockwise around a circle the terms ai appear in clockwise order fix n n for i 2 n let i 2 n i 1 for each i 2 n n we define i to be the set 3 i 2 n i i i the purity conjecture in type c 3 2 2 positroids in types a and c we realize the grassmannian gr k m as the space of k m matrices modulo row operations a matrix corresponds to the span of its rows the k k minors of a matrix representative give homogeneous coordinates on gr k m called plu cker coordinates for i n k let i represent the determinant of the matrix minor with columns indexed by i the totally nonnegative grassmannian gr 0 k m is the subset of gr k m where all plu cker coordinates are nonnegative real numbers up to multiplication by a common scalar for a point p gr k m the set m i m k i p 6 0 is called the matroid of p if p is a point in gr 0 k m the matroid of p is a positroid the subset of gr 0 k m consisting of all points with positroid m is a positroid cell remarkably positroid cells stratify gr 0 k m and each positroid cell is homeomorphic to a ball 8 the positroid stratification of gr 0 k m extends naturally to a stratification of the entire grassmannian gr k m by positroid varieties which has nice geometric and combinatorial prop erties for p gr k m there is a unique smallest positroid p which contains the matroid m of p we call p the positroid of p we have p equal to m if p gr 0 k m otherwise p is strictly larger than m the positroid variety corresponding to a positroid p is the set of all points in gr k m with positroid p and the totally nonnegative part of is the positroid cell corresponding to p for details see 3 in 1 the author extends postnikov s theory of total nonnegativity to the lagrangian grass mannian 2 n the parameter space of maximal isotropic subspaces with respect to a symplectic bilinear form concretely we realize 2 n as the subvariety of gr n 2 n which is cut out by the linear relations 4 i i i 2 n n the symmetric part of any gr n 2 n is the set theoretic intersection of with 2 n that is the subset of where the relations 4 hold the totally nonnegative part of 2 n denoted 0 2 n is the subset of 2 n where all plu cker coordinates are positive a positroid cell respectively variety is type c if its symmetric part is nonempty the symmetric part of a type c positroid cell is a totally nonnegative cell in 0 2 n totally nonnegative cells form a stratification of 0 2 n analogous to the positroid stratification which extends naturally to a stratification of 2 n by the symmetric parts of type c positroid varieties in particular the symmetric part of c is nonempty if and only if the intersection of c with gr 0 n 2 n is a totally nonnegative cell in 0 2 n for details see 1 2 3 grassmann necklaces and decorated permutations in this section we discuss two families of combinatorial objects which are in bijection with positroids all of these definitions and results as well as many additional details can be found in 8 definition 1 a grassmann necklace of type k m is a sequence i i 1 im of elements of m k such that ii 1 contains ii i for all i m where indices are taken modulo m note that if i 6 ii we must have ii 1 ii for a grassmann necklace i define mi j m n j i ii for all i m remarkably mi is a positroid with i mi and every positroid arises uniquely in this way definition 2 a decorated permutation is a permutation f sm with fixed points colored black or white 4 rachel karpman 1 2 34 5 6 123 234 345 456 156 126 124 246 245164 figure 1 a plabic graph with face labels arrows show the trip from 3 to 6 to obtain a grassmann necklace from a decorated permutation f for each a m let ia i m i a f 1 i or i is a white fixed point of f then i i 1 im is a grassmann necklace and this construction gives a bijection from grassmann necklaces to decorated permutations we say f has type k m if the associated grassmann necklace has type k m definition 3 8 section 17 for i j m we say that i j forms an alignment of the decorated permutation f if the numbers i f i f j and j appear in cyclic order and are all distinct note that the order of i and j matters for this definition if i j is an alignment it is not the case that j i is also an alignment 2 4 plabic graphs a plabic graph is a planar graph embedded in a disk with each vertex colored black or white the boundary vertices are numbered 1 2 n in clockwise order and all boundary vertices have degree one we call the edges adjacent to boundary vertices legs of the graph postnikov defines a collection of paths and cycles in g called trips as follows 8 start by traversing a leg of the graph starting on the boundary then proceed according to the rules of the road turn maximally left at every white internal vertex and maximally right at every black internal vertex continuing in this fashion we eventually reach a boundary vertex at which point the trip ends see figure 1 for an example we repeat this process for every boundary vertex of the boundary in the remainder of this paper we restrict our attention to reduced plabic graphs postnikov defined reduced plabic graphs in terms of certain local transformations and gave a criterion for a plabic graph g to be reduced 8 section 13 we take this criterion as the definition of a reduced graph definition 4 a plabic graph g is reduced if it satisfies the following criteria the purity conjecture in type c 5 1 the union of the trips defined above covers each edge of the graph exactly twice once in each direction 2 g has no leaves except perhaps some which are adjacent to boundary vertices 3 no trip uses the same edge twice once in each direction unless that trip starts and ends at a boundary vertex connected to a leaf 4 no trips t 1 and t 2 share two edges e 1 and e 2 such that e 1 comes before e 2 in both trips given a plabic graph g with m boundary vertices we define the trip permutation f of g by setting f a b if the trip that starts at boundary vertex a ends at boundary vertex b notice that if f has a fixed point at a then g must have a boundary leaf at a to avoid violating condition 3 above hence we can define the decorated trip permutation of g by coloring each fixed point of f either black or white depending on the color of the corresponding boundary leaf 2 5 face labels for plabic graphs let g be a reduced plabic graph with m boundary vertices and suppose the decorated permutation f of g has type k m let m m k be the positroid associated to f for each i m label each face f of g with an i if f is to the left of the trip which ends at boundary vertex i see figure 1 for an example once all trips are accounted for each face is labeled with an element of m k which is contained in m 10 moreover the faces adjacent to the boundary of g are labeled with the elements of the grassmann necklace i i 1 in ofm in clockwise order the boundary face between leg i 1 and leg i has label ii where indices are taken modulo m 7 the plu cker coordinates corresponding to minors with columns indexed by face labels of g give homogeneous coordinates on an open dense subset of the positroid variety of m 6 more precisely let f denote the set of face labels of g and let f be the subset of where the plu cker coordinates indexed by elements of f are nonzero a face weighting of g is an assignment of a number or weight to each face of g let c f c denote the space of nonzero face weights of g modulo multiplication by a common scalar then by 6 theorem 7 1 there is an isomorphism f f c f c which takes a point p f and labels each face of g with the corresponding plu cker coordinate of p we note further that f maps the totally nonnegative part of which is a positroid cell isomorphically onto the space of positive face weightings of g this is implicit for example in the statement of theorem 7 1 from 6 as the maps m m and referenced in the theorem statement take positive edge weightings to positive face weightings and vice versa for details see 6 section 5 3 5 4 2 6 symmetric plabic graphs for n n a plabic graph with 2 n boundary vertices is a symmetric plabic graph if it is symmetric as an uncolored network with respect to reflection through a distinguished diameter which intersects that boundary of the disk between vertices 2 n and 1 and between vertices n and n 1 and each vertex and its mirror image have opposite colors by convention the line of reflection runs vertically down the center of the graph with vertices 1 and 2 n appearing above vertices n and n 1 respectively the plabic graph in figure 1 is symmetric theorem 1 2 let m be a positroid of type n 2 n then the following are equivalent 1 the positroid cell corresponding to m has nonempty intersection with 2 n 2 for all i 2 n the decorated permutation of f of m satisfies f i f i 6 rachel karpman 3 for all i 2 n the grassmann necklace i of m satisfies ii i i 1 4 there is a symmetric plabic graph with associated positroid m definition 5 we say a decorated permutation grassmann necklace or positroid is type c if the associated positroid cell has nonempty intersection with 2 n 2 7 weakly separated collections and plabic tilings the following definitions with ad ditional details may be found in 7 definition 6 let i j m k we say i and j are weakly separated if there do not exist a b a b cyclically ordered such that a a i j and b b j i equivalently i and j are weakly separated if when the elements of m are arranged in a circle there is a chord separating the elements of j i from the elements of i j definition 7 let c m k then c is a weakly separated collection if for each i j c the sets i and j are weakly separated a weakly separated collection is maximal by inclusion if it is not contained in any larger weakly separated collection in m k equivalently if for every i m k with i 6 c there is some j c such that i and j are not weakly separated definition 8 let m be a positroid with grassmann necklace i and let c be a weakly separated collection in m k then c is a weakly separated collection in m if i c m a maximal weakly separated collection in m is maximal by inclusion if it is not contained in any larger weakly separated collection in m our goal is to prove a symmetric version of following theorem theorem 2 7 let m be a positroid and let c be a weakly separated collection in m then the following are equivalent 1 c is maximal by inclusion 2 c is maximal by size among all weakly separated collections in m 3 c is the set of face labels of a reduced plabic graph with associated positroid m 2 8 plabic tilings let m be a positroid and let c be a maximal weakly separated collection in m oh postnikov and speyer construct an abstract cw complex called a plabic tiling with vertices indexed by c then give an embedding of the complex into r 2 we proceed directly to a description of the embedded tiling which is all that we need see 7 section 9 for details fix m points v 1 vm which form the vertices of a convex m gon in r 2 numbered in clockwise order we construct a two dimensional cw complex c whose vertices are the points vi i i vi i c for each k 1 element subset k of m k the white clique corresponding to k is the set i c i k a for some a m for each k 1 element subset l of m k the black clique corresponding to l is i c i l b for some b l a clique is non trivial if it contains three or more vertices the points vi corresponding to elements of a non trivial clique are the vertices of a convex polygon in r 2 we take these polygons to be the two dimensional cells of c and the edges of these polygons to be one dimensional cells we also add an edge from vi to vj for any i j c such that all of the following hold the purity conjecture in type c 7 v 1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v 5 v 6 0 124 246 146 245 123 234 345 456 156 126 figure 2 a symmetric plabic tiling defined using the points v 1 v 6 at left this tiling is dual to the graph in figure 1 1 i j a b for some a b m 2 i j is the trivial white clique of i j 3 i j is also the trivial black clique of i j this construction yields a connected cw complex embedded in the plane remarkably taking the planar dual of c and coloring each vertex according to the color of the corresponding face we obtain a reduced plabic graph for each i c scott s construction assigns the label i to the face of of the graph corresponding to vi let g be a plabic graph with a boundary leaf at i m if the leaf i is white then i is contained in every face label of g if the leaf is black then i is contained in none of the face labels hence removing the boundary leaf at i and re indexing the boundary vertices has no effect on the combinatorial structure of the corresponding tiling and we may safely reduce to the case of plabic graphs whose trip permutations are fixed point free 3 symmetric face labels and 2 n in this section we prove that symmetric face weights of a symmetric plabic graph give ra tional coordinates on the symmetric part of the associated positroid variety and that positive symmetric face weights give coordinates on the corresponding totally nonnegative cell in 2 n definition 9 we say a symmetric plabic graph has symmetric face weights if each face has the same weight as its mirror image a graph has positive face weights if all of its face weights are positive up to multiplication by a common nonzero scalar lemma 1 let f be a face of a symmetric plabic graph g and let f be its mirror image then if f has label i f has label i proof reflecting g through the line of symmetry sends the trip ending at i to the trip ending at i for all i 2 n hence f is to the the left of the trip ending at i if and only if f is to the right of the trip ending at i the claim follows proposition 1 let be a positroid variety of type c in gr n 2 n and let g be a symmetric plabic graph for let c be the symmetric part of then restricting the face plu cker map f gives an isomorphism from an open dense subset of c to the space of symmetric face weightings of g restricting further to the totally nonnegative part of c we obtain an isomorphism to the space of positive symmetric face weightings of g 8 rachel karpman proof let f and f be defined as in section 2 5 and let cf be the symmetric part of f then cf is an open subset of c which is nonempty since in particular cf contains the totally nonnegative part of c since c is an irreducible variety 1 it follows that cf is an open dense subset of c let w denote the space of symmetric weights of g modulo scaling clearly f maps cf into w our task is to show that the map is surjective onto w for this note that f is a rational map which is regular on its domain of definition 6 it follows that f maps cf isomorphically to a closed subvariety of w since w is irreducible it suffices to show that cf and w have the same dimension let dim w identifying opposite pairs of faces in g and subtracting one to account for scaling we see that is one less than the number of faces of g which either intersect the distinguished line of reflection or lie strictly to its left but this is the dimension of cf by results of 1 section 5 hence the dimension of cf is precisely the dimension of w proving the claim next we show that f induces an isomorphism from the totally nonnegative part of cf to the space of positive symmetric weightings of g modulo scaling recall that f restricts to a bijection from the totally nonnegative part of which is contained in f to the space of positive face weights modulo scaling moreover we have seen that f maps cf bijectively to w the space of symmetric weightings again modulo scaling hence restricting f to the totally nonnegative part of cf gives an isomorphism to the space of positive symmetric weightings of g modulo scaling as desired we have shown that the face plu cker map f restricts to an isomorphism from a totally non negative cell in 2 n to the space of positive symmetric face weightings of a symmetric plabic graph note that since f is injective on f the map f takes a point p cf to a positive symmetric weighting of g only if p is in the totally nonnegative part of c a collection c of plu cker coordinates is a total positivity test for gr k m if all elements of c are simultaneously positive only for points in gr 0 k m hence any maximal weakly separated collection gives a total positivity test for gr k m which is minimal by inclusion similarly we may say a collection c of plu cker coordinates is a total positivity test for 2 n if whenever the element of c are simultaneously positive for p 2 n we have p 0 2 n proposition 2 5 shows that we obtain a total positivity test for 2 n from any symmetric plabic graph for 0 2 n by for example taking the labels of all faces which either intersect the distinguished diameter or lie strictly to the left of it 4 symmetric weakly separated collections definition 10 a weakly separated collection c is symmetric if for all i c we have i c hence the face labels of a symmetric plabic graph form a symmetric weakly separated collec tion in particular if i i 1 i 2 n is a grassmann necklace of type c then the elements of i form a symmetric weakly separated collection since we have ii ii 1 for each i 2 n with indices taken modulo 2 n note that if i is contained in a symmetric weakly separated collection then i and i must be weakly separated definition 11 an element i of 2 n n is admissible if i and i are weakly separated let i 2 n n we say that i has a full pair at a a if a a i i has a half pair at a a if exactly one of a a is in i and i has an empty pair at a a if a a 6 i for a b n we say the pair a a is above b b if a b hence when a a b b are drawn as boundary vertices of a plabic graph with our conventions the elements of a a indeed lie above the elements b b the purity conjecture in type c 9 lemma 2 i is admissible if and only if no full pair of i has both an empty pair above it and an empty pair below it and no empty pair has both a full pair above it and a full pair below it proof note that i is obtained from i by replacing the full pairs of i with empty pairs and vice versa hence i i is precisely the union of the full pairs of i and i i is the union of the empty pairs of i the lemma follows we say i 2 n n is pair free if i has no full pairs and consequently no empty pairs pair free elements will be important in the proof of our main result note that i i if and only if i is pair free for a grassmann necklace i i 1 i 2 n of type c we have i 1 i 2 n 1 i 1 so i 1 is pair free by a similar argument so is in 1 lemma 3 let m be a positroid of type c with trip permutation f let j be a set of pair free elements contained in a weakly separated collection in m then the following hold 1 for i j if a f 1 a n and f 1 a a then a i 2 for i j if a f 1 a n and f 1 a a then a i 3 for i j j either i n j n or j n i n proof to prove 1 observe that by symmetry f 1 a f 1 a is an alignment of f so by corollary 11 4 in 7 if i contains a then i would necessarily contain a as well contradicting the fact that i is pair free hence i must contain a and not a the proof of 2 is analogous for the last condition let i and j be pair free elements of 2 n n suppose we have a b n such that a i j and b j i then since i and j are pair free we have a j i and b i j without loss of generality say a b then a b b a since a b i j and b a j i i and j are not weakly separated the claim follows by contrapositive for f as above let 5 s a n f 1 a n let r s 1 by lemma 3 a symmetric weakly separated collection c in m contains at most r pair free elements if c contains r pair free elements then they must be obtained by starting with i 1 and successively replacing a with a with each a s until we have in 1 note that the elements of s may or may not be replaced in order definition 12 let m i i 1 i 2 n f and r be as above we call a collection j m a spine if j r and j i 1 i 2 n is a weakly separated collection the collection of face labels of any symmetric plabic graph g contains a spine consisting of the faces of g which intersect the midline this follows since the pairs of trips that cross at edges of g which intersect the midline are precisely the pairs a a where a n and f 1 a n see 1 for details 5 symmetric plabic tilings we fix the following conventions for plabic tilings the points v 1 v 2 n are evenly spaced in counterclockwise order around a circle centered at the origin which intersects the horizontal axis midway between v 2 n and v 1 on the left and midway between vn and vn 1 on the right see figure 2 lemma 4 with our choice of conventions for an admissible set i 2 n n the reflection of vi across the vertical axis is vi the point vi lies on the vertical axis if and only if i is pair free to the left of the vertical axis if vi has full pairs above empty pairs and to the right otherwise 10 rachel karpman proof let i be admissible then i is obtained from i by exchanging full and empty pairs note that both full and empty pairs contribute zero to the vertical component of the vector vi so vi and vi differ only in their horizontal component it is enough to show that the horizontal component of vi vi is zero let xa be the horizontal component of va for each a n then each xa appears twice in the sum vi vi since either i and i each have a half pair at a a or exactly one of i i has a full pair but a n xa 0 which proves the claim it follows that for i admissible vi lies on the vertical axis if and only if vi vi but since i and i are weakly separated vi vi if and only if i i 7 since i i if and only if i is pair free it follows that vi lies on the vertical axis if and only if i is pair free since a a is above b b if and only if va and va appear to the left of vb and vb points vi appear on the left side of the graph if i has full pairs over empty pairs and on the right if i has empty pairs over full pairs lemma 5 letm be a positroid of type c and let c be a symmetric weakly separated collection in m which is maximal by size and hence gives the face labels of a plabic graph let l k 2 n where l n 1 and k n 1 then 1 i i is in the white clique of l is the black clique of l 2 n l 2 j j is in the black clique of k is the white clique of k 2 n k k k proof we have i l a for some a 2 n if and only if i l a hence i 2 n n is in the white clique of l if and only if i is in the black clique of l this proves 1 and the argument for 2 is analogous proposition 2 let m be a positroid of type c and let c be a symmetric weakly separated collection in m which is maximal by size then c is the set of face labels of a symmetric plabic graph proof since m is of type c there exists a symmetric plabic graph with positroid m whose face labels give a symmetric weakly separated collection so in particular a symmetric weakly separated collection in m that is maximal by size must be maximal by size among all weakly separated collections in m and hence must be the collection of face labels of a plabic graph we may therefore construct a plabic tiling c and the planar dual of c is a plabic graph g our task is to show that g is symmetric by lemma 4 and lemma 5 the plabic tiling c corresponding to c is symmetric about the vertical axis up to reversing the colors of tiles hence g embedded as the planar dual to c is symmetric about the vertical axis up to reversing the colors of vertices let i i 1 i 2 n be the grassmann necklace of m then i 1 and in 1 are both pair free and hence vi 1 and vin 1 lie on the vertical axis but i 1 is the label of the boundary face between legs 2 n and 1 of g while i 1 is the label of the boundary vertex between legs 2 n and 1 hence the vertical axis cuts the boundary disk of g between vertices 2 n and 1 and again between boundary vertices n and n 1 we note that in 1 is obtained from i 1 by replacing j with j for each j n such that f 1 j n and so in particular vi 1 is above vi 1 in the tiling it follows that g is a symmetric plabic graph which is embedded according to our conventions and the proof is complete 6 proof of the main result lemma 6 let i j 2 n n then i is weakly separated from j if and only if i is weakly separated from j the purity conjecture in type c 11 proof suppose i is not weakly separated from j then there exist a b i j and x y j i such that a x b and y are cyclically ordered now since a b i j we know that a b j i similarly x y i j moreover y b x and a are cyclically ordered since if the elements of 2 n are arranged around a circle the sequence a x b y is obtained from a x b y by a reflection so i is not weakly separated from j the lemma follows by contrapositive together with the fact that i i lemma 7 let c be symmetric weakly separated collection inm which is maximal by inclusion then c contains a spine proof let i i 1 i 2 n be the grassmann necklace of m and suppose c does not contain a spine then c is not maximal by size since otherwise c would be the set of face labels of a symmetric plabic graph extend c to a maximal weakly separated collection c in m by maximality c cannot contain any pair free elements which are not found in c and in particular c does not contain a spine hence c must contain some pair free element i 6 in 1 such that no pair free element of the form i a a with a n is contained in c next triangulate each two dimensional tile of c we claim there is a triangle t in the resulting triangulated plabic tiling which contains a segment of the midline immediately below i and has vi as its top vertex we first show that the entire segment from vi 1 to vin 1 is contained in the union of the tiles of c and so in particular the segment of the midline immediately below vi is contained in the union let c be the set of face labels of a symmetric plabic graph form then c contains a spine and so in particular the union of the tiles of c contains the desired line segment but then the same must be true true for c because every plabic tiling for m is related by a series of local transformations called mutations which leave the union of the tiles unchanged 7 hence the portion of the midline immediately below vi must be contained in either an edge of the triangulated complex or the interior of a triangle tile note that vi is pair free and any neighbor of i differs from i in exactly two places hence every neighbor of i has at most one full pair and one empty pair and is therefore admissible if the segment of the midline immediately below vi were contained in an edge of the triangulated complex then i would have an admissible neighbor below it which would necessarily be a pair free element of the form i a a for some a n this contradicts our hypothesis hence t is the top most vertex of a triangle with the remaining two vertices lying on either side of the midline let j 1 and j 2 be the other two vertices of t where j 1 lies on the left side of the midline and j 2 on the right without loss of generality we may suppose the triangle t is white if not we simply replace c with j j c note that j 1 and j 2 each have only one full pair and one empty pair let i i j 1 j 2 and suppose i i a it follows that j 1 and j 2 each have an empty pair at a a j 1 has a full pair above a a and j 2 has a full pair below we claim that j 1 is not weakly separated from j 2 indeed suppose j 1 has a full pair b b while j 2 has a full pair c c then some b b b and some c c c are contained in j 2 j 1 while a a j 1 j 2 since b and c are on opposite sides of the chord connecting a and a when the elements of 2 n are arranged around a circle hence there is no chord separating b c from a a so j 1 and j 2 are not weakly separated as desired similarly j 2 is not weakly separated from j 1 now both j 1 and j 2 are weakly separated from all elements of c and both are admissible it follows that neither j 1 nor j 2 is contained in c indeed if j 1 c then so is j 1 contradicting the fact that j 2 is weakly separated from every element of c similarly we cannot have j 2 c 12 rachel karpman but then we can add j 1 j 1 to c and obtain a symmetric weakly separated collection in m this contradicts the maximality of c and the proof is complete lemma 8 let c be a symmetric weakly separated collection in m where m is a positroid of type c if c is maximal by inclusion then c is maximal by size proof by lemma 7 we can assume c contains a collection j of r pair free elements suppose that c is not maximal by size extend c to a maximal weakly separated collection c which of necessity is not symmetric let i c c then i is weakly separated from each element of c we claim that i is also weakly separated from each element of c and that i is admissible but then c i i is a symmetric weakly separated collection in m which properly contains c a contradiction by symmetry for each such j c we have j c so i is weakly separated from j and by lemma 6 i is weakly separated from j our task is to show that i and i are weakly separated suppose i is not weakly separated from i then there is no chord separating the full pairs of i from the empty pairs so there must exist some 1 a b c n where either a a and c c are full pairs of i and b b is an empty pair or a a and c c are empty pairs of i and b b is a full pair interchanging i and i if necessary we may assume the first case holds we claim that f 1 b n suppose not then there exist pair free elements j 1 j 2 c such that j 2 j 1 b b by construction i is weakly separated from both j 1 and j 2 note that for j j each full pair of i contributes an element to i j and each empty pair contributes an element of j i in particular there exist a a a c c c such that a c i j 1 since j 1 j 2 and i are all n element subsets of 2 n there must be at least one x 2 n such that x x 6 a b c and x j 1 i consider the chord from a to c since x b j 1 i and a c i j 1 it follows that x and b are on the same side of this chord but the chord from a to c crosses the chord from b to b so b and x are on opposite sides of the chord from a to c this in turn implies that i is not weakly separated from j 2 a contradiction hence we must have f 1 b n suppose f 1 b b by symmetry f 1 b b it follows that f 1 c and f 1 b form an alignment unless f 1 c c f 1 b cyc but if the latter occurs then by symmetry f 1 c f 1 b c cyc so f 1 c and f 1 b form an alignment in either case by 7 corollary 11 3 any element of c which contains c c must also contain b this contradicts our assumption on i and the proof is complete in this case if f 1 b b the argument is similar either f 1 a and f 1 b form an alignment if f 1 a 6 a f 1 b cyc or else f 1 a and f 1 b form an alignment in either case we get a contradiction this completes the proof theorem 3 let c be a symmetric weakly separated collection with i c m then c is maximal by inclusion if and only if c is the set of face labels of a symmetric plabic graph proof the face labels of a symmetric plabic graph form a symmetric weakly separated collection in m which is maximal by size and so must be maximal by inclusion conversely let c be a symmetric weakly separated collection in m which is maximal by inclusion by lemma 8 it follows that c is in fact maximal by size and is hence the set of face labels of a symmetric plabic graph by proposition 2 corollary 1 let m be a positroid of type c with decorated permutation f then i m is a face label of some symmetric plabic graph for m if and only if the following conditions hold 1 for all i j 2 n if i j forms an alignment of f and f i i then f j i the purity conjecture in type c 13 2 i is admissible proof let i i 1 i 2 i 2 n be the grassmann necklace of m by 7 corollary 11 4 i is weakly separated from each element of i if and only if 1 holds since i is type c i 1 i 2 n is a symmetric weakly separated collection hence i 1 i 2 n i i is a weakly separated collection in m if and and only if i is admissible and weakly separated from i 1 i 2 n the result follows by theorem 3 call an admissible set i left handed if it has full pairs over empty pairs and hence falls to the left of the midline in a symmetric plabic tiling then we can restate theorem 3 in terms of total positivity tests corollary 2 let c be a collection of elements of 2 n n which satisfies the following conditions 1 all elements of c are admissible 2 every element of c is either pair free or left handed 3 for each i j c the set i is weakly separated from both j and j then c is maximal by inclusion among collections that meet condition 1 3 if and only if c n 2 n 2 2 if this holds the plu cker coordinates indexed by c give a total positivity test for 2 n which is minimal by inclusion removing any element of c leaves a collection of plu cker coordinates which is not a total positivity test proof we note that c c i i c is a symmetric weakly separated collection moreover c is maximal by inclusion among sets that satisfy 1 3 if and only if c is maximal as a symmetric weakly separated collection a maximal weakly separated collection in 2 n n has n 2 1 elements total if the weakly separated collection is symmetric then n 1 elements form a spine while n n 1 2 are left handed hence by lemma 8 a symmetric weakly separated collection has at most n 2 n 2 2 faces that are either left handed or pair free a symmetric weakly separated collection with the maximal number of elements that are either left handed or pair free must be maximal since at most n 1 of those elements are pair free and the total size of the collection is at most n 2 1 hence c is maximal by inclusion if and only if c n 2 n 2 2 the statement about positivity is immediate from the discussion in section 3 remark 1 it is natural to ask whether the conditions of corollary 2 are unnecessarily strict and in particular whether any weakly separated collection of admissible left handed elements may be extended to give the face labels of a symmetric plabic graph to see that this is not the case let i 1 3 6 and j 1 4 6 then i and j are admissible left handed elements of 6 3 which are weakly separated from each other but i 2 3 5 so 2 5 i j while 1 4 j i since the sequence 1 2 4 5 is cyclically ordered i is not weakly separated from j and there is no symmetric maximal weakly separated collection which contains both i and j references 1 rachel karpman total positivity for the lagrangian grassmannian advances in applied mathematics 98 25 76
