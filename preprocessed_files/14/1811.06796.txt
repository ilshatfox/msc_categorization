holonomic minimal extensions 121 references 123 1 introduction let x y be a map of smooth varieties over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic 0 dx dx k be the ring of k linear differential operators on x and hol dx be the category of holonomic dx modules this work is concerned with the direct and image functors hol dx hol dy mostly in the case when is finite the main goal is to work out when m and n are semisimple for m hol dx and n hol dy and also to find the structure of the decomposition we discuss separately and and lastly we con sider the subcategory con x of connections by which we mean dx modules that are coherent over ox and study how they interact with and in particular the notion of simply connected varieties is given a new treatment 1 1 the direct image assume that is finite so that in particular is exact prop 2 10 let l and k be the fraction fields of x and y respectively and l l k be a galois cover so that l l and l k are galois and we denote their galois groups h and g respectively let x be the integral closure of x in l so that we have finite maps x x y and assume for now that x is also smooth the inertia group gm is a subgroup of symmetries of the dx module m m and there exists a central extension g m of gm that actually acts on m for details see 3 2 let gm be the isomorphism classes of finite dimensional repre sentations of g m theorem a thm 3 21 and cor 3 35 let m be a simple holonomic dx module 1 if suppm is finite over y so needs not be finite then m is semisim ple 2 assume that is finite that x is smooth and suppm x then m gm v h k m d modules and finite maps 3 where m is a simple dy module v is the dual of an irreducible g representation and v h v v h v v h h the multiplicities of the simple components are m m dimk v h 1 h trh 1 h h h h where is the character of gm the case when x is singular is treated in corollary 3 35 and when is galois so that h e theorem 4 5 provides projection operators on the isotypical components v km and on the simple submodules m of m the proof of theorem a 1 goes as follows when m is torsion free and is finite since is exact one can first reduce to proving that m is semisimple at the generic point of y we then have the map specl speck where k k is a field extension of finite type over k and by going to the galois cover l one can assume is galois with galois group g if now m is semisimple over the ring of k linear differential operators dl dl k and finite dimensional as l vector space then the ring extension dl g m dl m is again semisimple over the skew group ring dl g m g m is a central extension of the inertia subgroup of m in g so that one can finally infer that m is semisimple over dk from a well known descent equivalence it has already been established that m is semisimple in the much more gen eral situation when is projective but not necessarily finite accomplished in a long impressive development that allowed successively greater classes of holonomic mod ules see 9 see also 11 80 79 and finally 66 th 19 4 2 however in spite of the fact that it is an assertion in the realm of characteristic 0 algebraic varieties the cited work rely on g a g a the riemann hilbert correspondence and the notions weights and or harmonic metrics one can therefore say that this treatise stems from a frustration at not finding in the literature an algebraic description of the de composition of for example ox avoiding the detour to analytic topology and sheaf cohomology our algebraic proof that m is semisimple when is finite makes no distinction between regular and irregular singular holonomic module or being of geometric origin and no auxiliary arithmetic or analytic notions are used the algebraic approach also allows for a description of the decomposition of m in terms of symmetries of m assume now that a finite group g acts on x levasseur and stafford 54 85 employ a morita equivalence between modules over the ring dgx of invariant dif ferential operators and modules over the skew group algebra dx g to decompose the dgx module m for certain m when x y xg is the invariant map see 54 th 3 4 this has its geometric counterpart in our use of descent for such the ring dgx coincides with the subring of liftable differential operators d y in dy but also for general there is a natural homomorphism of d modules m m induced by a canonical global trace section of the relative dualiz ing module x y an advantage of studying the d y module m rather than the dy module m is that the former is coherent over ox when m is a connection while m normally is not coherent when the support of m intersects the ramifi cation locus the drawback being that it is harder to work with d y than dy one is also usually more interested in the dy module since then the de rham cohomology is available still by work of f knop 46 one has a reasonably good knowledge of the properties of d y also when is uniformly ramified which is slightly more general than invariant maps making it possible to get if m is torsion free and coherent over ox along the ramification locus of that m is semisimple over 4 rolf ka llstro m d y and its simple components are in perfect correspondence with the simples in the dy module m th 4 16 more specifically consider an invariant map x spec s v y spec s v g where v is a finite dimensional k vector space with symmetric algebra s v and g is a subgroup of glk v so that d y dgx again by a theorem of levasseur and stafford 53 d y is generated by the subalgebras s v g s v g dgy and they have also given a presentation of the d y module e when g is a complex reflection group and e is a certain natural exponential dx module in the case of a weyl group e controls the structure of a certain important d y module on a reductive lie algebra we complement and reprove their latter result by giving a presentation of the full direct imagedy module e th 8 9 this presentation as that of e however has the deficiency that no cyclic generator is obtained in this context theorem 3 31 adds to the normal basis theorem for galois field extensions l k that are non algebraic over k by showing that cyclic generators of l either as dk or k g module are the same we give an explicit semisimple decomposition of ox when g is an imprim itive complex reflection subgroup g ed e n of gl v th 8 15 and at the same time explicit realizations of the irreducible g ed e n representations as subspaces of a polynomial ring previously these representations were constructed in a more computational way 6 7 returning to a general finite map of smooth varieties x y there exists a natural coarsest stratification by locally closed subsets xi yj i ij j j such that one gets restrictions xi yi that are e tale to this stratification we associate factorizations x pi zi qi y such that pi is minimal totally ramified along the generic point xi of xi and qi is maximally e tale along the generic point of zi pi xi if x y is galois then pi is even totally ramified over pi xi in fact we prove the existence of such a factorization for any point in x which is a result of independent interest that can be regarded as a refinement of stein factorization th 7 17 associated to the factorizations are the inertia submodules ti of n ox which are kernels of certain inertia trace morphisms tri n n when is galois it indeed arises from a trace map with respect to the map pi now for each stratum yi there exists thanks to the semisimplicity of n a unique maximal submodule nj with vanishing local cohomology r yj nj 0 we say that the nj are the canonical submodules of n theorem b thm 7 29 1 nj i ij ti 2 if yj belongs to the closure of yj then nj nj thus nj j j forms a filtration and taking successive quotients one gets a canon ical decomposition of n associated to the stratification yj of y theorem b is applied to the invariant map s v sn s v where sn is the symmetric group acting as permutations of a basis of v and describe the isotypical decomposition of the canonical submodules nj of s v th 8 6 and also the isotypical content of successive quotients in the canonical filtration cor 8 7 1 2 the inverse image we first have the following general result theorem c thm 3 14 and thm 3 17 let x y be a surjective morphism of smooth varieties over a field k of characteristic 0 and let n be a coherent holonomic dy module d modules and finite maps 5 1 a assume that is smooth then n is semisimple if and only if n is semisimple and if n is simple then n is simple b if n is a semisimple connection then n is a semisimple connec tion c assume is finite if n is semisimple then n is semisimple and if n is simple then n is simple d assume that n is semisimple and ny is of finite type over oy y for all points y of height 1 such that the closure of y intersects the discriminant d i e y d 6 then n is semisimple 2 assume that is finite and that l k is galois with galois group g let n be a simple dy module such that i n 6 0 let m be a simple submodule of n gm be the inertia subgroup of m in g and put t g gm then j j n t i 1 gi m e for some integer e where gi are representatives of the cosets g gm if n is a connection or is a galois cover then one can erase j j on the left moreover a the integer e divides both the order gm of the inertia group and the degree of b rk n rk m divides the degree of here i y 0 y is the inclusion of the complement of the discriminant locus of a finite map and if x 0 y 0 is the corresponding base change j x 0 x is the projection on the second factor gi m denotes a certain twist of a dx module m in fact n is always a semisimple connection when n is a semisimple con nection which was proven using hodge theory in 8 in theorem 5 39 we give an algebraic proof of this assertion when n belongs to the class of covering connections described below to a finite group g there exist finitely generated fields l over k such that g is isomorphic to a subgroup of the automorphism group aut l k letting k denote the invariant field lg there is a well known picard vessiot equivalence between the category of finite dimensional k representations of g and the category of dk modules m such that the inverse image dl module l k m is isomorphic to ln say m is l e tale trivial where n rankkm this is described in detail in 5 5 where k does not have to be algebraically closed contrary to the usual statement in this equivalence the inverse direct image of d modules correspond to restriction induction of representations with respect to an inclusion of groups prop 5 35 so that branching problems for representations of groups can be translated to decompo sition problems for inverse and direct images of d modules and vice versa certain decomposition problems for d modules can be studied as a branching problem in group theory it is thus no surprise that many classical results in the representation theory of finite groups can be extended to results about inverse direct images of d modules and we present here a collection propositions 3 9 and 3 12 theo rem 3 17 corollary 3 18 theorem 3 19 corollaries 3 20 4 8 and 4 12 but since the d module categories are bigger these results imply corresponding ones in rep resentation theory and not the other way around so that although the proofs are sometimes inspired by representation theory they do not depend on it for instance the semisimplicity of m can be deduced from the picard vessiot equivalence when m is e tale trivial but there exist a great many semisimple modules m of interest whose differential galois group is non finite 6 rolf ka llstro m the category of covering dx modules consists of torsion free modules over ox that generically decompose into a direct sum of rank 1 modules after taking an inverse image over a finite field extension and thus includes the category of e tale trivial modules here the main result is that connections which moreover also are covering modules form a semisimple tensor category which is stable under arbitrary inverse images thms 5 37 and 5 39 it is proven that e tale trivial connections occur as submodules of connections of the form oxm for some e tale map xm x th 7 20 to understand the covering d modules one first needs to consider the category i x of dx modules of rank 1 which is therefore rather thoroughly studied where a main tool is an extension to an algebraic context k saito s notion of logarithmic forms and residues prop 5 12 in theorem 5 19 we compare i x 0 to i x when x 0 is an affine subvariety of a smooth projective variety x a several variable extension of the classical residue theorem th 5 20 is used to get a kind of purity result for regular singular connections of rank 1 cor 5 22 and also to define a de gree on 1 1 hodge classes cor 5 23 now a dk module of rank 1 is determined by a closed 1 form clk m m and one quite generally can ask what type of field extension l k is required to make l k m trivial requiring that l k be finite theorem 5 26 is a classification of the category of e tale trivial dk modules m of rank 1 if one goes only slightly beyond finite field extensions the condition on that e k m e for some elementary field extension e k one adds loga rithms and exponentials can be characterized by a well known liouvillan condition we provide a new uniform proof of this classical result allowing non regular field extensions and also several variables th 5 28 1 3 connections and simply connected varieties when the only regular sin gular connections m on a quasi projective variety x are the trivial ones so that m onx we say x is simply connected s c there is also the apparently weaker condition that all e tale trivial connections are trivial and one saysx is e tale simply connected we prove that the smooth locus of a rational normal projective varieties is s c prop 6 4 and that for a smooth proper map with connected fibres x y x is s c if and only if y and a closed fibre xy is s c prop 6 6 next we give a version of the grothendieck lefschetz theorems stated for connections instead of fundamental groups this is concerned with an inclusion y x of smooth projective varieties and the functor con x con y theorem d thm 6 13 1 if y is a complete intersection in x then is fully faithful 2 if 1 holds and moreover dimy 2 then is an equivalence of categories grothendieck s theorem is about a comparison of the e tale fundamental groups of y and x and therefore e tale trivial connections while theorem d allows general connections but see remark 6 15 a somewhat related idea to analyze when a variety is s c is to use a notion of differential coverings which is a family of maps p c x such that there exists a dense subset of smooth points x 0 x so that each x in x 0 is cut out by the c meaning that the tangent space of x is spanned by the image of the tangent spaces of the c such that x p c see lemma 6 16 say moreover that x is differentially simple if x can be provided with a differential covering such that each c s c the main result here is theorem e thm 6 19 differentially simple varieties are simply connected this can be used to generalize the known result that smooth projective rationally connected are simply connected by allowing normal quasi projective varieties and d modules and finite maps 7 at the same the proof is entirely algebraic the earlier proof for smooth projective varieties is based on hodge theory cor 6 21 one also gets that if a normal variety is dominated by a simply connected variety that also has a good differential covering then it is simply connected cor 6 25 this generalizes earlier results by removing a properness assumption it is perhaps worth mention also that in section 2 3 we study the relative canon ical module x y and its interaction with rings of differential operators this work has a long history which for a time involved a collaboration with my good friend rikard bo gvad resulting in a spin off paper 40 that can be suitable parallel reading to the present one i want to express to him my sincere appreciation for his here mostly hidden contribution i also want to thank claude sabbah for very valuable remarks 2 operations on d modules over finite maps first we describe the structure of the canonical module x y of a finite flat map x y as module over liftable derivations and relate this to the right dx and dy modules x and y respectively then the inverse and direct image functors of d modules over such finite maps are treated for the direct image we describe how the ordinary sheaf direct image is a subfunctor taking modules to modules over the liftable differential operators 2 1 the jacobian ideal and the e tale locus unless explicitly mentioned other wise in this paper x y denotes a finite surjective map of smooth varieties over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic 0 let x and y be the sheaves of ka hler differentials over k on x and y respectively and x y the relative ka hler differentials appearing as the cokernel of the pull back morphism 2 1 1 0 y p x x y 0 taking exterior products x det x and y det y we get a homomorphism of invertible sheaves det p y x defining a global section of homoy y x x ox 1 y which we call the jacobian section and also an isomorphism y im det p j x remark 2 1 the fitting ideal f 0 x y j where det p dy j dx is a principal ideal since x k and y k are smooth and is independent of the choice of basis dy and dx of y and x respectively besides the presentation 2 1 1 of x y one often computes f 0 x y from a presentation of as a complete intersection so that j x v i z where z y is a smooth map of smooth varieties and i is an ideal locally generated by a regular sequence resulting in the presentation i i 2 j z y x y 0 for example working locally when i f is a principal ideal then f 0 x y f where f is the image in ox of a y relative derivative f of f dz y f f dz if z is a relative coordinate of z y the ramification divisorb is the divisor corresponding to j so that f 0 x y ox b 1 y ox x ox b and b x x ht x 1 x y x x where x y x x j is the length of the ox x module x y x and x is the canonical discrete valuation of the ring ox x the discriminant branch locus d 8 rolf ka llstro m is the image of the divisor b which is again a divisor as is finite letting i y 0 y d y be the open inclusion we have the base change diagram bc x 0 j 0 x y 0 i y where of course the point is that 0 is e tale the ramification locus b is in general a proper subset of x j x 0 2 2 differential operators let ty be the tangent sheaf of k linear derivations of oy so that ty is both an oy module and lie algebra such that 1 a 2 a 2 a 1 2 when a oy and 1 2 are sections in ty and there is a natural notion of ty module the diagonal action of ty on y commonly called the lie derivative see e g 35 sec 2 1 42 sec 2 1 induces a diagonal action on the determinant bundle y such that the negative of this action results in a structure of right module y over ty it is well known that if y is smooth then its ring of differential operators equals the subring that is generated by ty dy d ty so that ty modules are the same as dy modules see e g 41 prop 2 2 therefore y is a right dy module see 15 but take notice that if y is singular and dy is not generated by first order differential operators one cannot make this conclusion let x y be a finite surjective morphism of smooth varieties and d tx ty be its tangent morphism then d tx ty and also the canonical map ty ty are injective so we can define t y ty tx as a subsheaf both of ty ty and tx we call t y the subsheaf of liftable tangent vector fields the sheaf of liftable differential operators d y is defined by d y p dy p ox ox where dy acts on the image of ox ox at the generic point since d y dy thus t y d y can regarded as subsheaves both of dy and dx since 0 is e tale we have ty 0 t 0 y 0 j t y so that over y 0 all differential operators are liftable and generated by liftable tangent vector fields dy 0 d 0 y 0 d t 0 y 0 when x y is ramified so that y 6 y 0 we usually have d t y 6 d y for example oy may be simple over d y whereas the defining ideal of the discriminant locus d is always a proper d t y submodule of oy see 39 2 3 the relative canonical bundle and the isomorphism 2 3 1 about the relative canonical module it is well known see e g 34 cor 8 3 that there exists an isomorphism 2 3 1 x y 1 y x where x y is the relative dualizing sheaf but i have been unable to see any very conceptual understanding of such an isomorphism in the literature one isomorphism is described in proposition 2 2 which is moreover linear over the action by liftable derivations t y neither side in the isomorphism is provided with a natural structure of d y module the map is defined by selecting canonical global sections tr and in the source and target such that tr where the first is a global section of homd x ox oy and the latter a global section of homd y right y x and we get a kind of conceptual understanding of by proving that is the poincare dual of tr prop 2 19 d modules and finite maps 9 the pairs ox oy and the canonical sheaves x y are left and right d y modules respectively in corollary 4 18 we prove that if is uniformly ramified there exists an isomorphism homd y ox oy homd y y x and that both sheaves are rank 1 constant local systems where on the left right we have homomorphisms of left right modules 2 3 2 details let qcoh ox be the category of quasi coherent ox modules the direct image functor for the category of quasi coherent modules qcoh ox qcoh oy has the right adjoint functor m homoy ox m and the relative dualizing sheaf is 2 3 2 x y oy homoy ox oy where x ox y ox is the canonical flat map of ringed spaces 1 since ox and oy are left modules over dx and dy respectively it follows that x y is a left module over d t y where the action is induced by the diagonal action of t y so that one may perhaps naively think that x y is even a d y module this is however not true as indicated by the fact that d y need not be generated by first order differential operators see example 2 5 similarly the sheaf homox y x is a d t y module but in general not a d y module as already mentioned we give a construction of an isomorphism in 2 3 1 which moreover is compatible with the differential structure and also show that the trace map 2 3 3 tr x y oy 7 1 where 1 is the evaluation at 1 homomorphism of a section of the right side of 2 3 2 is a split surjective homomorphism of d t y modules in section 2 1 is defined a canonical global jacobian section of the right side of 2 3 1 which also is the image of 1 in the induced homomorphism 2 3 4 ox x ox 1 y j 1 ox b x y we will see in proposition 4 14 how the morphism 2 3 4 is important for relating the direct image of a d module with the ordinary sheaf direct image next we describe a canonical trace section tr of the left hand side of 2 3 1 it is clearer to do this first in the affine case so that x specb and y speca and is a finite flat morphism a b of smooth k algebras and we will define a canonical element tr of b a homa b a it will coincide with the more common definition of the trace of an element b acting a lineary as multiplication map using an a basis of b see also 37 for this construction of tr which in fact gives the trace of homomorphisms of any free a module we have canonical isomorphisms 2 3 5 enda b a homa b a b a homa enda b a where the first isomorphism is adjunction and the second follows since b a is flat and of finite presentation now let tr 0 homa enda b a be the image of the identity element in the left side of 2 3 5 b enda b be the map defined by b 1 b 2 b 1 b 2 b 1 b 2 b and put tr tr 0 b a this canonical construction of tr will make it clear that tr is a d a linear homo morphism moreover since all constructions are canonical it will also be obvious 1 we write since will later be used for inverse images of d modules 10 rolf ka llstro m that the at first locally defined sections tr glue to a global section of x y also when x and y are non affine the global sections and tr correspond in the sought isomorphism 2 3 1 let d x be the subring of dx that is generated by d y and ox and dx t y be the subring that is generated by and dy t y and ox thus dx t y d x dx proposition 2 2 let x y be a finite and generically smooth morphism of smooth schemes over a field of characteristic 0 1 there is a canonical isomorphism of dx t y modules x y x ox 1 y such that tr where tr and are described above here tr is a global section of homd y ox oy x y and is a global section of homd y y x x ox 1 y 2 the homomorphisms in 2 3 4 and 2 3 3 are d t y linear we will at some places below use such an isomorphism to identify x y with x ox 1 y in particular it can be used to relate the structure of the direct image of a d module to the ramification of a map remark 2 3 1 i have not seen a direct construction of the trace morphism x ox 1 y oy here it depends on the isomorphism in 2 3 1 and the trace in 2 3 3 another indirect construction is to factorise x y into a closed embedding and a smooth morphism 2 if a differential operator in dy preserves both oy and x y regarded as submodules of the stalk at the generic point of x then the map in 2 3 3 is compatible with this action a similar remark can be made regarding the isomorphism 3 in section 2 7 we explain in a more conceptual way the existence of the iso morphism using d module constructions corollary 4 18 contains more precise information regarding this isomorphism as a preparation for the proof of proposition 2 2 we recall some results related to discrete valuation rings in a slightly more general situation than is required here let r s be an inclusion of discrete valuation rings such that s is of finite type over r hence free over r and assume that the residue field extension ks kr is separable put n dimr s by 18 ch iii 6 prop 12 there exists an element z in s whose residue class in ks is a primitive element over kr and such that the set of powers 1 z zn 1 is a basis of s over r and if f r x is the minimal polynomial of z then z i f z trs r is a basis of the r module s r homr s r the element s r defined by zi i n 1 sometimes called the tate trace 83 depends on the choice of element z in contrast to the canonically defined trs r lemma 2 4 let f be the minimal polynomial of the element z that is described above then the element forms a basis of the s module homr s r and trs r f z proof let i be the dual basis of zi and write f zn bn 1 zn 1 b 0 then the relations z i i 1 bi i imply that s s n 1 homr s r the relation between and trs r is called euler s formula see 18 ch iii 6 7 d modules and finite maps 11 proof of proposition 2 2 assume first that x y is affine given by a homomor phism of smooth k algebras a b where b is free over a k b k ab is e tale where k is the fraction field of a since x 0 y 0 is e tale it follows that b is a product of fields it suffices to consider one of these fields at a time so that in the following we assume that b k b which we denote by l and hence we have a finite field extension l k the trace section tr all a modules in 2 3 5 are in fact t a modules under various diagonal actions where t a ta tb the isomorphisms are d t a linear and tr 0 is a t a invariant since it is the image of the invariant element 1 in the left side of i so that tr 0 homa enda b a t a homd t a enda b a putting d da db we prove that tr tr 0 is d linear if s is a multi plicative system in a then the trace morphism behaves well under localisation s tr s 1 trbs 1 as 1 bs 1 as 1 in particular trl k l k is the localisation of tr trb a since k a b a l k homk l k is a left dk module under the diagonal action and the localisation of results in a dk linear homomorphism l endk l notice that k ad t a d t k dk it follows that the composed map trl k l k is dk linear since the natural maps b l and a k evidently are d linear and the localisation diagram that occurs does commute it follows that tr is d linear assume now that x and y are not affine since tr localise as described above the locally defined canonical elements glue to a global d y linear homomorphism tr ox oy this proves the assertion about tr in 1 the jacobian section the pull back map p b a a k b k commutes with the action of t a which therefore defines a d t a linear map det p homd t a k b k where a k and b k are provided with the right d t a module structures which are described in 2 2 again if s is a multiplicative system we have s s 1 bs 1 as 1 a ks 1 as 1 k b ks 1 bs 1 k now a k and b k are even right d modules and by the above identity localises to a k a d t a dk linear map k k l k so it is in particular d linear since the localisation diagram that occurs is commutative it follows that homd a k b k when x and y are not affine then the locally defined map glue to a global d y linear homomorphism 1 y x there is a canonical isomorphism homd t y 1 y x homd t y ox x ox y that sends to the homomorphism in 2 3 4 this completes the proof of the last sentence of 1 selecting a basis of a and b defines a basis of theb module homa a b in a regular system of coordinates xi and yi we can select the bases dy 1 dyd and dx 1 dxd respectively and dy 1 dyd dx 1 dxd we then have j where j f 0 b a as described in section 2 1 let p be a prime of height 1 in specb q p and put r aq and s bp so we have a map r s of discrete valuation rings where ks kr is finite and separable then f 0 s r f j p see remark 2 1 and by lemma 2 4 trs r f x p where the tate trace p is a basis of b a p it follows that we get the isomorphism p b a p homa a b p bp tr p f x 7 bp p f x 12 rolf ka llstro m since tr and are global sections of the locally free ox modules of rank 1 x y and hom 1 oy 1 y x respectively and ox satisfies serre s condition s 2 so that sections of either sheaf are determined by its values in stalks at points of height 1 it follows that we in fact get an isomorphism s r homr r s since and tr are t y invariant sections it follows also that is an isomorphism of d t y modules this finishes the proof of the first sentence in 1 it is straight forward to see that the diagonal action of t y on the left and right sides of 2 3 3 and 2 3 4 respectively makes 2 3 3 and 2 3 4 into homomorphisms of d t y modules showing 2 next is an example showing that the relative canonical bundle is not preserved by d y first note that there is only one possible action on x y of a liftable differential operator the reason is that dy 0 j d y see 2 2 which is generated by derivations so that j x y is a j d module in general the image of a section p d y in j j d y acts on j j x y so that p will act on x y only if under this action it preserves the submodule x y j j x y now we can proceed with the example example 2 5 let a k y 1 y 2 b k x 1 x 2 y 1 x 1 x 2 y 2 x 1 x 2 so that a is the invariant ring under symmetric group s 2 and let l k be the corresponding field extension we have j x 1 x 2 and y 0 in the digram bc is defined by j 2 x 1 x 2 2 y 21 4 y 1 y 2 6 0 first observe that differential operators in dl do not act on l k while dk does act on l k since tk acts diagonally and tk generates dk the differential operator p x 1 x 2 2 y 1 y 2 y 1 y 1 y 2 y 2 2 y 2 is liftable since it is symmetric so that p is generated by derivations of k and therefore acts on l k we have b a b b j using the isomorphism where a 1 a 2 x 1 x 2 a 2 writing b a a x 1 x 2 now p 1 j 2 j 2 j 1 b a as an illustration we verify this by instead acting on b a we have y 1 x 1 x 2 12 x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 1 4 y 1 y 2 y 1 2 y 2 y 21 4 y 1 y 2 x 1 x 2 so that y 1 a 1 a 2 x 1 x 2 a 2 y 1 2 y 2 y 21 4 y 1 y 2 a straightforward tedious computation gives p a 1 a 2 x 1 x 2 2 a 2 j 2 k and again p l k b a 2 4 direct and inverse images inverse and direct image functors of d modules are treated in 12 15 35 and we will only concentrate on a few points pertaining to finite surjective maps x y for all constructions of inverse and direct images of d modules one makes use of the dy dy bimodule dy by pulling it back to x in two different ways using the left adjoint of and the left oy module dy put dx y dy ox 1 oy 1 dy this is a dx 1 dy bimodule described in e g in 15 vi 4 2 12 ii 3 35 def 1 3 1 using the right adjoint of and the right oy module structure on dy put dy x dy ox ox dy x y ox dx y homoy ox dy ox 1 ox 1 homoy ox dy recall that x y is finite this is a 1 dy dx bimodule where the two mod ule structures here are more tricky to understand and will therefore be explained this is best understood using a finite injective map of smooth k algebras a b d modules and finite maps 13 instead of sheaves on schemes and thus by describing below the following da db bimodule db a homa b da da a homa b a da a b a bm da a b a 1 a 1 a a d op a a a a b a 1 a 1 a a d op a a b b a da a 1 a on the first line the right a module da is used for the a homomorphisms b da and the tensor products the structure of all occurring vector spaces as a b bimodules should be evident on the second line the first equality sign follows from the isomorphism in proposition 2 2 and the second equality follows since the opposite ring dopa of da is isomorphic to a ada a 1 a the last isomorphism is defined by p op 7 p 1 a b and p op d op a see also 35 lemma 1 3 4 as for the da db bimodule structure of bm the right da module da is used for the right db module structure on db a homa b da which is determined by the action of derivations tb b b i bib i homa b da where i bi i is the image of in b a ta the left action of da on db a is defined by p b p b where p da on the other hand the right da module da is used for the left da action on b a da a 1 a with respect to the diagonal action on da a 1 a and trivial action on b the left da module da is used for the right db action on b a da a 1 a with respect to the diagonal action on b a da and trivial action on 1 a see 35 lemma 1 2 9 all the maps in bm are the natural ones and they are isomorphisms of da db bimodules lemma 2 6 the db da bimodule da b and da db bimodules db a are finite both as da module and db module proof let pnb pnb a be the module of relative principal parts so that db limnhomb pnb b and da b limnhomb pnb a b where limn denotes direct limits the exact sequence 0 b a pna pnb pnb a 0 results in the dual exact sequence of db modules 2 4 1 0 db da b lim n ext 1 b pnb a b 0 see 31 notice that pna and pnb are locally free over a and b respectively and that supppnb a belongs to the ramification locus in x the right side of 2 4 1 belongs to the grothendieck group of local cohomology groups of the db module b along closed subspaces of supppn b a hence by bernstein s theorem it is of finite type therefore da b is finite over db it is evidently finite as right da module the corresponding assertions for db a b a b da b follow since the functor b a b is an equivalence between db da and da db bimodules example 2 7 we illustrate how to compute with the bimodule db a in bm in its last incarnation which thus is isomorphic to the first definition because of propo sition 2 2 so let a b be a finite map of regular local rings that are essentially of finite type and choose regular systems of parameters yi and xi of a and b respectively so that the derivations are described by a n i 1 a yi yi ta and b n i 1 b xi xi tb where xi xj ij and yi xj ij put also 14 rolf ka llstro m dx dx 1 dxn dy dy 1 dyn and dy 1 y 1 yn the right da action on a is determined by ady a try a a a dy where try a n i 1 yi a yi and the left action on da b is determined by a dx p dy 1 dx p a try a dy 1 the right action of db is determined by dx p dy 1 b trx b dx p dy 1 i b yi dx yip dy 1 if we have a liftable derivation t a ta tb we use the same symbol for the derivation of a and its lift to a derivation of b so that n i 1 xi xi n i 1 yi yi then the right and left actions are related as follows dx p dy 1 dx p dy 1 dx p try dy 1 trx dx p dy 1 dx p dy 1 dx p dy 1 trx dx p dy 1 dx p try dy 1 dx try p dy 1 trx try dx p dy 1 localising to a map a bj we have ta t a so that in particular the partial derivatives yi are liftable and we have dx j 1 dy hence dx yi j 1 dy yi yi j j 1 dx and since dx yi dx trx yi we have trx yi n i 1 xi yi xi yi j j so that yi dx p dy 1 dx p dy 1 y dx p dy 1 yi j j dx p dy 1 j 1 yij the ring j dx 0 can be regarded either as a dx 1 dy or 1 dy dx bimodule in a natural way and as such we denote it j dx 0 i and j dx 0 ii respectively we have then injective homomorphisms f dx y ox 1 oy 1 dy j dx 0 i p 7 p g dx y x y ox dx y j dx 0 ii 0 tr p 7 0 p where p is the unique lift of a differential operator p on y to a differential operator on x 0 and tr is the canonical global section of x y see 2 3 4 in 2 3 since j dx y j dx and the canonical map j ox j x y is an isomor phism it follows that the restriction of f and g to x 0 are isomorphisms let coh dx be the category of coherent left dx modules the inverse image functor is defined coh dy coh dx m 7 dx y 1 dy 1 m ox 1 oy 1 m and the direct image functor coh dx coh dy m 7 m dy x dx m d modules and finite maps 15 remark 2 8 the general definition of the inverse image is the derived functor m dx y l 1 dy 1 m dx dy where dx is the dimension of x simplifies to the above expression when is finite and surjective for the same reason we will see in proposition 2 10 that we do not need the derived version of the direct image functor see 15 vi 4 2 and 5 1 since b and d are divisors it follows that the direct image functors j and i for the open embeddings are exact assume that m contains no section whose support is contained in b then m i i m i 0 j m hence if u is an open set the action of a section p dy u on m u is by lift ing its restriction to a section ofdy 0 u y 0 to a differential operator in j dx 0 u and then acting on m 1 u j j m 1 u j m 10 u y 0 so that in effect 2 4 2 m dy x y ox m i 0 j m example 2 9 let a k y 1 yn b k x 1 xn be an injective polynomial map and m be a db modules such that bj b m m then m m as a module and the action of yi is yi m j yij 1 m let x y be a morphism finite type where x and y are smooth and cohf dx be the category of coherent dx modules such that the restriction suppm y is a finite morphism thus if is finite then coh dx cohf dx proposition 2 10 the direct image functor coh f c dx cohc dy m 7 m is exact assume that is finite then coh dx coh dy is exact and the left dx module dx y and the right dx module dy x are both flat the earliest reference to this well known result is in 36 which in turn refers to 43 but i was unable to find a proof in either source for a published proof see 12 th 2 11 10 still due to its importance and also to avoid references to analytic structures a complete proof is included proof since the ordinary sheaf direct image functor is exact on the category of sheaves with finite support over y and the functor m dy x dx m x y ox dy dy m takes modules of finite support over y to sheaves with finite support over y it follows that m x y ox dy ldy m since x is of finite type over k there exists a regular immersion i x alk where alk is the l dimensional affine space over k put z a l k k y and define the composed map f x x k y z where the first is the graph embedding and the second is i id x k y z letting p z y be the projection on the second factor we then have p f so that m p f m where m 1 f m is a dz module such that restriction of p to suppm 1 is finite since f is a closed embedding and hence exact by kashiwara s theorem it suffices to prove that the functor p coh f dz y is exact now putting zi y ai z 0 y the map p can be factorized p p 1 p 2 pl where pi zi zi 1 is induced by the projection map ai ai 1 hence we have an isomorphism of derived functors p p 1 p 2 pl see 35 prop 1 5 21 where pi defines a functor coh f dzi cohf dzi 1 it suffices therefore to see that p 1 is exact and this follows if the homology 16 rolf ka llstro m h p 1 m is concentrated in one degree when suppm is finite over y now p 1 m z 1 y m a 1 m the relative de rham complex 35 prop 1 5 28 and letting t be a regular parameter for the affine space a 1 k and t is a basis for the relative derivations tz 1 y satisfying t t 1 only the following two homology groups occur m t m t m 0 and m tm thus it is enough to prove that m t 0 so assume on the contrary that there exists a non zero section m of m such that tm 0 since the support suppm of m is finite over the closed subset ym 1 suppm y there exists a non zero polynomial p t oym t such that p t m 0 which we can select to have minimal degree in t since 0 t p t m t p t m and degt t p degt p we get that t p 0 and hence p oym since by assumption m 6 0 it follows that pm 6 0 we get a contradiction therefore m 0 if is finite then both the functor dy x dx and are exact this implies that the right dx module dy x is flat switching left for right is an exact functor hence dx y is also a flat left dx module 2 5 duality and finite maps first it is recalled how a duality operation d gives rise to the category of holonomic d modules next is presented an accessible proof that d d when is finite and the trace map tr id is described the isomorphism in 2 3 1 in 2 3 is explained also using the duality d the appendix contains an account for the properties of the minimal extension functor which is a mechanism for getting simple holonomic d modules as extensions of simple modules from a locally closed subset 2 5 1 duality let dx denote the dimension of the smooth variety x on the derived category dc dx of complexes of dx modules with coherent homology one can define the functor dx dc dx dc dx m 7 rhomdx m dx dx ox 1 x which is contravariant and satisfies d 2 x id so it is a duality the functor dx does not preserve the full subcategory coh dx dc dx so therefore say that a module m coh dx is holonomic if dx m is concentrated in degree 0 denote by hol dx coh dx the full subcategory of holonomic dx modules if x specl where l k is a field extension of finite type and dl dl k is the ring of k linear differential operators then hol dx modfd dl k the category of dl modules that are of finite dimension over l the fundamental fact is that ifm is holonomic then dx m is again holonomic so that dx restricts to a duality functor dx hol dx hol dx m 7 extdxdx m dx ox 1 x we need to know how to compute dx in an important case say that a d module m is a connection if it is coherent over ox let con dx be the category of connections 2 it is well known that connections are locally free over ox and if m is a connection then m homox m ox is again a connection the following proposition shows in particular that con dx hol dx proposition 2 11 if m con dx then dx m m where dx acts diagonally on the right side so that dx m is again a connection 2 thus in this work all connections are integrable d modules and finite maps 17 a proof is included only to clarify this well known result as it is more or less proven in 35 example 2 6 10 but two subtle details can be more emphasized one is having to do with the following lemma and the second with certain vertical isomorphisms in loc cit that exist due to the fact that dx is generated in degree 1 lemma 2 12 let f be a locally free dx module of rank m andm be a dx module which is locally free over ox of rank n then the dx module f ox m provided with the usual diagonal action of dx is a locally free dx module of rank nm proof one may assume that x speca for some k algebra a such that the a module of derivations ta is free e g a is local and k smooth let the derivations xi form an a basis of ta it suffices now to prove that da am is free of rank r as da module when m is a da module which is free of rank r as a module so assume that m ri 1 ami and that we have a relation pi qi mi 0 recall that da is free as right a module with basis 1 x 1 2 x 2 nxn the order o p of p p da is the maximal value of i i such that p 6 0 now pi qi mi piqi mi r j 1 rij mj where o rij o piqi letting i be the set of indices such that o piqi attains it maximal value t we get i i piqi mi ti mi 0 where o ti t i i this implies that if i i and piqi s s a then t s 0 and hence piqi 0 and as da does not have zero divisors we get pi 0 proof of proposition 2 11 see first 35 example 2 6 10 which we complement as follows the right most tensor product over ox in the koszul or spencer complex k m dx ox tx ox m k ox ox m of m is taken with respect to the left ox module structure on k ox the dx module structure is given by the diagonal action of tx and the differential is induced from the usual dx linear differential of k ox it follows from lemma 2 12 that k m is locally free over dx so that k m is a resolution of m by acyclic objects we have as detailed below rhomdx m dx homdx k m dx homox k m dx tx homox k ox homox m dx tx homdx k ox homox m dx homdx k ox homox m ox ox dx x m ox dx the last entry on the first line denotes the tx invariants with respect to the diagonal action on homox k m dx and the isomorphism relies on the fact that dx is generated by ox and tx the first equality on the second line is adjunction for ox modules noting that it is an isomorphism of ox modules before taking tx invariants in the last line x m ox dx is the de rham complex of the free dx module m ox dx lem 2 12 since x dx is a resolution of x loc cit lemma 1 5 27 it follows that x m oxdx is a resolution ofm ox x dx this gives dx m m it is a general fact that defines a functor hol dy hol dx see 35 th 3 2 3 therefore one also gets the functor dx dy hol dy hol dx lemma 2 13 if m con dy then m m in fact it suffices that be non characteristic with respect tom for this identity to hold 35 th 2 7 1 18 rolf ka llstro m proof we apply proposition 2 11 and notice that m is also a connection m dx dym m m where the last equality follows since m is locally free over oy and x y is flat proposition 2 14 let x y be a finite morphism of smooth varieties and n be a holonomic dx module 1 if n 0 then n 0 2 if n is a connection then n is a connection 3 the following are equivalent for a non zero connection n a n is a connection b is e tale proof we can assume that x and y are affine so that we have a finite map a b of smooth k algebras the sequence 2 4 1 also gives the exact sequence 0 db db a b a b limnext 1 b pnb a b 0 so that tensoring with the db module n results in the exact sequence 0 n n db a db n b a b lim n ext 1 b pnb a b db n 0 this implies 1 if the middle term is finite over a then n is a finite b module giving 2 3 if is e tale then da b db which gives that n is a connection proving a if is not e tale then the right hand side of the above exact sequence is a non zero torsion a module hence is not a connection and since the image of a morphism from a connection to a d module again is a connection n cannot be a connection this proves b 2 5 2 duality and finite morphisms theorem 2 15 let x y be a finite map of smooth varieties then dy dx and we have the adjoint triple if moreover is smooth then and we have the adjoint triple of functors i e is both the left and right adjoint functor of there exists an isomorphism of functors dx dy for any proper map of smooth varieties but since the proof is fairly involved see 12 th 2 11 3 15 prop 9 6 35 th 2 7 2 we give a more accessible proof for a finite map based on proposition 2 10 paying special attention to the role of proposition 2 2 proofs of the other assertions in theorem 2 15 can also be found in loc cit lemma 2 16 let m 1 and m 2 be left db modules then m 1 b b db m 2 b b m 2 db m 1 as b modules proof we know that m 1 b b and b b m 2 are right db modules where the db action is determined by the action of derivations of b according to m 1 m 1 m 1 where is the negative of the lie derivative of along similarly m 2 m 2 m 2 therefore both sides makes sense the map m 1 b b db m 2 b bm 2 db m 1 m 1 m 2 m 2 m 1 is well defined since by the above description a simple computation shows that m 1 m 2 m 1 m 2 clearly is an isomorphism proof of theorem 2 15 dy dx since ox is locally free over oy and also in order to see the main steps clearly we work instead with a finite homomorphism a b of smooth k algebras so that b is free over a first note d modules and finite maps 19 that da b is a free left da module so that rhomda db a da homda da a b a da homa b a a a da b a da da b where the equalities are canonical isomorphisms of db da bimodules also since da b is a free right da module we have rhomda da b da homda b a da da homa b a a da b a a da db a where the equalities are canonical isomorphisms of da db bimodules if m is a holonomicdb module we have canonical isomorphisms of complexes

2 16 noting that b bda b a 1 a is a da db bimodule 7 follows from bm in section 2 4 finally we note that da db is an adjoint pair of functors let d db and d da be the derived categories of bounded complexes of db and da modules of finite type respectively then we have as detailed below homd db m n homd db m da b da n homd db m rhomda db a da lda n 1 homd da m rhomda db a n homd da db a l db m n 2 homd da db a db m n 3 homd da m n 1 follows since da b is free over da and from 2 is ordinary adjunction in the derived sense and 3 follows from proposition 2 10 is an adjoint pair this follows formally from the already proven dy dx for a proof that dx dy when is smooth see 15 vii cor 9 14 35 th 2 1 remark 2 17 notice that in the proof of d d we need proposition 2 2 at the step 7 in stark contrast to the situation for right d modules where it is not needed see section 2 7 20 rolf ka llstro m 2 6 the trace the trace homomorphism for a modules relative to a finite map a b was discussed in section 2 3 for the da module a for general da modules m the trace morphism is tr m homa b da db b am m b m 7 b m since b is locally free over a it follows that tr is surjective the traces in the category of oy and dy modules are related in a commutative diagram of d y modules m tr m tr m m where is the right adjoint of in the category of o modules proposition 2 18 let x y be a finite morphism and m con dy the composition m m m m is given by m 7 trx y 1 m hence m m is a split homomorphism proof the isomorphism follows from lemma 2 13 for the remaining part we can assume that x and y are affine the map m m is m 7 trb a 1 m homa b da db b am so that composing with tr m m we get the map tr m trb a 1 m 2 7 a d module motivation for the isomorphism the existence of the isomorphism 1 in proposition 2 2 seems coincidental when viewing it from within the category of o modules taking into account the action of the ring of differential operators we will now construct this isomorphism in a natural way put d x m rhomdx m dx dx so that dx m d x m ox 1 x this defines functors d x d b hol left dx dbhol right dx d x dbhol right dx dbhol left dx wheredbhol dx denotes the category of bounded complexes of left right coherent dx modules with holonomic homology then d x is an equivalence of categories d x d x id and d x ox x let p homdy left ox oy homdy right d y oy d y ox be the isomorphism that arises from applying d y the direct image of a right dx module n is n n dx dx y we have then for a left dx module d y m d x m the proof can be read off from the proof that da db in theorem 2 15 simply be erasing all the occurrences of a and b but to see clearly that we do not need the fact that b a is isomorphic to 1 a a b we again write down the needed steps and refer to the previous proof for explanations d a m da rhomda da b db m da rhomda da b ldb m da rhomdb m rhomda da b da rhomdb m da b rhomdb m db ldb da b rhomdb m db l db da b d b m db ldb da b d b m db d modules and finite maps 21 the proof of proposition 2 2 contains two canonical homomorphisms one of left d t y modules tr ox oy the trace map and one of right d t y modules y x the jacobian map here tr is a restriction of the trace morphism of left dy modules tr oy ox oy in the following sense tr tr see proposition 4 14 while can be extended to a homomorphism of right dy modules y x x dx dx y 7 1 where x is the direct image of the right dx module x proposition 2 19 we have homdy left ox oy ktr homdy right y x k the isomorphism induces an isomorphism homdy left ox oy homdy right y x so that in particular tr c for some non zero element c in k moreover induces the dx t y linear isomorphism x y x ox 1 y as described in proposition 2 2 proposition 2 19 thus states that the extensions of the canonical maps tr and to homomorphisms of d modules are in fact poincare duals of one another up to a multiplicative constant proof by theorem 2 15 dimk homdy ox oy dimk homdx ox oy dimk homdx ox ox 1 therefore tr generates the first hom space that generates the second one is proven similarly to see the isomorphism use p and the fact that d x ox x and d y oy y that tr c follows from what is already proven that restricts to the isomorphism follows since was defined by mapping tr to in the proof of proposition 2 2 3 semisimple inverse and direct images to begin there is a discussion of descent for d modules later applied for the main result in this section that if is finite then is a semisimple functor on the category of holonomic modules and if one also knows the symmetries of m the intertia group one gets a complete abstract decomposition in terms of representations of the inertia group it is discussed when the semisimplicity of n or n implies the semisimplicity of the other and clifford s theorem about restrictions of representations of finite groups is extended to d modules the well known normal basis theorem for galois field extensions l k k here assuming the characteristic 0 and that k k is transcendent is complemented by showing that cyclic generators of a module over the group algebra are the same as cyclic generators over the ring of differential operators 22 rolf ka llstro m 3 1 descent of d modules by a theorem of grothendieck 32 if x y is a finite surjective morphism of smooth varieties then the inverse image functor n 7 n induces an equivalence between the category mod oy of quasi coherent oy modules and the category desy ox of descent data m of quasi coherent sheaves m on x where p 1 m p 2 m and pi x y x x i 1 2 are the two projection maps and the isomorphism satisfies a cocycle condition with respect to the different projections pij x y x y x x y x for details see 19 ch 6 1 th 4 it is actually sufficient to require that be a faithfully flat quasi compact morphism of schemes when working with mod oy since pi and pij are finite maps the sheaf of liftable derivations t y maps to dx pi dx yx and pij pi dx yx yx hence the image gener ates a subsheaf t x dx as lie algebra and ox module and we can consider the subring dx t x of dx that it generates see also 2 2 similarly we have the sub rings dx yx t x yx dx yx and dx yx yx t x yx yx dx yx yx let des d t x be the subcategory of desy ox consisting of coherent dx t x modules with descent data m where now is an isomorphism of dx t x modules notice that the pull back p i m i 1 2 is naturally a dx yx t x yx module when m is a dx t x module and similarly the pull backs of p i m to x y x y x forms dx y x yx t x y x yx modules the inverse image functor defines a functor g coh dy t y desy dx t x n 7 g n n writing g instead of since the target category is different 3 the grothendieck equivalence then implies lemma 3 1 assume that is a finite morphism of smooth varieties we have an equivalence of categories g coh dy t y desy dx t x n 7 g n n the equivalence g is compatible with base change so that in particular we get also the equivalence referring to the diagram bc coh dy 0 coh d t y 0 desy 0 dx 0 t x 0 desy 0 dx 0 over the generic point coh dk desk dl where k and l are the fraction fields of y and x respectively we will have great use of this when moreover l k is galois and the descent category can be recognized as an ordinary category of modules over a skew group ring say that is a galois covering a k a trivial torsor if there exists a finite group g of y automorphisms of x defining an action g x x such that the morphism g k x x y x g x 7 g x x is an isomorphism of schemes where g is regarded as a discrete group scheme see 19 ch 6 2 example b if is a galois covering then x y is e tale so that d t y dy and conversely if bg is the invariant ring with respect to a faithful action on b and the associated morphism specb specbg is e tale then is a galois covering in particular specl speck is galois if k is the fixed field of a finite group of automorphisms of the field l an automorphism of l induces an automorphism dl dl p 7 p p 1 let now g be a subgroup of aut l k the category mod k g dl of k g dl modules consists of dl modules m which is also a k g module such that g pm p gg m m m g g the skew group algebra dl g of 3 since x y x and x y x y x need not be smooth when is ramified the pull backs p i m i 1 2 need not form d modules assuming is e tale we do get d modules since then dx t x dx d modules and finite maps 23 g with coefficients in dl consists of functions g g pgg g dl g 7 pg where the product is g 1 g pg 1 g 1 g 2 g qg 2 g 2 g 1 g 2 g pg 1 q g 1 g 2 g 1 g 2 then mod k g dl mod dl g and it is somewhat more convenient to work with dl g modules instead of k g dl modules the following lemma collects the descent and ascent functors between the cat egories mod dl g and mod dk denote by dll the ordinary dl g dk bimodule structure of dl and put drl homdl g dll dl g which is a dk dl g bimodule in a natural way we also have dll homdk drl dk lemma 3 2 we have the adjoint triple of functors between the categories mod dk and mod dl g drl dl g dll dk homdl g dll where moreover the left and right adjoint functors of dll dk are isomorphic i e homdl g dll drl dl g we have drl dl g m mg proof below m and n are left dl g and dk modules respectively to begin dll dk homdl g dll is an adjoint pair homdl dll dk n m homdk n homdl g d l l m homdk n m g the right dk module dl is free see lemma 2 12 so that after selecting a basis we can define an isomorphism of dl g modules which is functorial in n dll dk n homdk drl dk dk n homdk drl n therefore homdl g m dll dk n homdl g m homdk drl n homdk drl dl g m n showing that drl dl g dl dk is an adjoint pair it remains to see that the left and right adjoints of dll dk are isomorphic functors this would be immediate if we know already that dll dk defines an equivalence of categories there is a homomorphism of dk modules which is functorial in m drl dl g m homdl g dll dl g dl g m homdl g dll m m 7 p 7 p m since both functors in m on either side of the arrow are additive and exact to see that it is an isomorphism it suffices to check the assertion when m dl g in which case the left hand side becomes dl considered as left dk module by multiplication on dl from the left for the right hand side we have isomorphisms of left dk modules noticing that the action of dk commutes with the action of g homdl g dll dl g dl g g dl k k g g homk k dl k k g g homk k g dl g homk g k g dl dl we have used here the fact the group ring k g is self dual homk k g k k g as k g modules remark 3 3 the functors in lemma 3 2 in fact define equivalences of categories as follows from a suitable morita theorem see 67 th 2 5 cor 2 6 since dx is simple the morita theorem gives an equivalence mod dx g mod d y when y xg however i believe it is more conceptual to arrive at the equivalence mod dl g mod dk below by appealing to descent 24 rolf ka llstro m proposition 3 4 galois descent let x y be a galois covering with galois group g then desy dx mod dx g and we have an equivalence of categories g mod dy mod dx g n 7 g n n the quasi inverse is g mod dx g mod dy m 7 drx dx g m mg where dx is regarded as a dy dx g bimodule in particular the functor g mod dk mod dl g n 7 g n n defines an equivalence of categories with quasi inverse g mod dl g mod dk m 7 drl dl g m mg proof this is certainly well known but i have been unable to find a precise refer ence and at the same time it would require much space to write down a detailed proof instead one can look at 19 ch 6 2 example b where it is is proven that a g action on an x scheme z is equivalent to a descent datum on z in that proof where in the notation of loc cit s y s x and x z one can replace the x scheme z everywhere by on the one hand a coherent dx module with a g action which is the same as a dx g module and on the other hand it can be replaced by a coherent dx module provided with e tale descent datum and all arrows between x schemes are replaced by homomorphisms of dx modules remark 3 5 assume that x y is a galois covering andm be a dx g module we have then a canonical homomorphism of dy modules g m homdx g d l x m m m 7 1 more concretely this can be identified with the inclusion m g m if x y is galois then the category desy dx is fibred over mod dx i e we have the functor e desy dx mod dx g mod dx where e m is the dx module that remains after forgetting the g action in this context maschke s theorem takes the following form proposition 3 6 assume that l k is galois with galois group g 1 consider the functor e mod dl g mod dl where e m is m regarded as dl module only then e m is semisimple if and only if m is semisimple 2 let h g be a homomorphism of finite groups so that l is a dl h module using let m be a dl h module such that m is semisimple as dl module then dl g dl h m is a semisimple dl g module proof 1 the proof that m is semisimple when e m is semisimple is proven exactly in the same way as the usual maschke theorem for modules over group rings by averaging over the finite group g conversely if m 1 is a maximal proper sub module of e m then gm 1 is another maximal proper submodule implying that the radical of e m is a dl g submodule of m hence it is 0 if m is semisimple therefore e m is semisimple d modules and finite maps 25 2 we have e dl g dl h m gi g h gi m where the notation on the right side is explained above definition 3 8 since m is semisimple it follows that each gi m is semisimple hence 2 follows from 1 the duality dl onmodfd dl restricts to a duality on the subcategorymodfd dl g of modfd dl the descent functors respect this duality lemma 3 7 dlg g dk and dkg g dl proof if m modfd dl g there exists a g equivariant resolution of m dk m g extndk m g dk extndl m dl g dl m g therefore since dk dl we have dkg g dl moreover as g and dl dk it follows that dlg g dk 3 2 twisted modules and the inertia group if l k is galois and m is a simple dl modules of finite dimension over l we will decompose m using translation symmetries of m with respect to elements in the galois group an automorphism of the field l gives rise to a new dl module m where m m as sets but the action of dl is twisted as p m p 1 m p dl m m where on the right the p 1 action is already known notice that m m as dk module if k is fixed by let g be a subgroup of the galois group autk l of l over k and consider the dl g module dl g dl m then as dl module we have dl g dl m g g mg where we have identified the dl submodule g m with the twisted module mg if m is simple then each twisted module mg is also simple so we can conclude that dl g dl m is semisimple by proposition 3 6 definition 3 8 let l k be a finite galois field extension and m be a simple dl module the inertia group ofm over k is the following subgroup of the galois group gm g autk l mg m the inertia group is important partly because of the following proposition we will later see more precisely how it controls the decomposition of m th 3 27 proposition 3 9 let specl specl be the morphisms of schemes associated to a finite galois extension l k if m is a simple dl module with trivial inertia group gm e then m is a simple dk module the proof will be presented a little later if l k is not galois it does not follow that m is simple for example if l 6 k and gl aut l k e then the module l always contains the proper submodule k to give a concrete application we consider the effect of going to invariant differen tial operators on natural rank 1 d modules that can be associated to arrangements of hyperplanes in cn put b c x 1 xn and m db b b m i h i i where the i are linear forms in c n and i c in general m is 26 rolf ka llstro m not simple and i do not know a precise condition on that makes m it so but if n is high enough and n ni nn satisfies ni n then m n is simple 4 letg glk v be a subgroup that is generated by pseudoreflections of the finite dimensional vector space v and b s v the symmetric algebra let a bg b be the inclusion of the invariant ring where a again is a polynomial ring by the chevalley shephard todd theorem the action of an element g in g takes a linear form i to another linear form g i let a 1 r be a set of linear forms that is preserved by g and put i a i i then g g so that putting g one can regard g as acting on the exponents of the linear forms then g m m g mg and mg m if and only of g 0 modzn by proposition 3 9 we can conclude the following result proposition 3 10 assume that m is simple then the following assertions are equivalent 1 m is simple 2 g 6 0 modzn g g g 6 e proof of proposition 3 9 since m dl dl g dl g dl m it suffices to prove that dl g dl m is a simple dl g module where g is the galois group of l k prop 3 4 since gm is trivial the simple module 1 m has multiplicity 1 in dl g dlm let p dl g dl m m 1 m be the dl linear projection on 1 m by proposition 3 6 dl g dl m is semisimple hence it contains a simple dl g submodule n such that p n 6 0 since n dl g dl m is semisimple as dl module and 1 m has multiplicity 1 it follows that 1 m n therefore dl g dl m dl g 1 m n which implies the assertion in general the inertia group gm of a simple dl module m def 3 8 only has a projective action on m so that we will have to replace gm by a certain central extension g m to make m inte a g m module the construction is as follows for each element g in gm there exists an isomorphism of dl modules g m mg and since k is algebraically closed g is determined up to a factor in k this gives rise to a cocycle f g g k f g 1 g 2 g 1 g 1 g 2 1 g 2 where f g 1 g 2 is a dl linear automorphism of the simple module m and is hence determined by an element in k putting n gm it follows that fn is a coboundary so that the cocycle f determines an element in the cohomology group h 2 gm n where n k is the subgroup of nth roots of unity also f deter mines a central extension 3 2 1 1 n g m gm 1 of gm by n such thatm is a module over dl g m one may call the pair g m the true inertia group of m if a dl module m is not a dl gm module it will not descend to a dl 1 module for l 1 l gm but there exists a galois extensions l l k with galois groups h aut l l and g aut l k where g m g then if p specl specl is the map of l l it follows that p m is a dl g m module conversely if m is a dl g m module where g m g then the invariant space mh is a dl g m module giving rise to projective dl gm module 4 conditions that the localized db module b b m be simple can be found in 27 d modules and finite maps 27 the map induces a homomorphism of rings dl g m dl g and using this homomorphism dl g becomes a right dl g m module example 3 11 let l k be a finite galois extension with group g and be a g semiinvariant in l by which we intend that g g where is a character g k we put 1 m and define the dl module m dl where can be regarded as an abstract generator for m such that m tl but also as an element in the field extension l 1 m make a choice of function g k g 7 g 1 m k such that g 1 m m g then we get an isomorphism of dl modules g m mg l 7 g 1 mlg l l and a cocycle c g g n c g 1 g 2 g 11 1 m g 1 2 1 m g 1 g 2 1 m it defines a central extension m g g and m is a dl g module for example let the alternating polynomial in k x 1 xn g sn be the symmetric group and l be the fraction field of the polynomial ring k x 1 xn since sn only has one non trivial character it follows that the above constructed map s n sn is non split and that the dl s n module l 1 m is not a dl sn module below we consider dl g as a dl dl g m bimodule where the left action of dl is the natural multiplication map proposition 3 12 assume that specl speck is galois with cyclic galois group g let m be a simple dl module such that gm g then m n for some simple dk module n remark 3 13 by the equivalence in theorem 5 31 proposition 3 12 is an exten sion of 1 th 11 22 proof since the cohomology group h 2 g k 0 when g is cyclic it follows that m is a dl g module then the assertion follows from proposition 3 4 3 3 decomposition of inverse images we know that j n j n is semisim ple ifn is semisimple and j is an open immersion it has more generally been conjec tured by m kashiwara 44 that n be semisimple when is non characteristic to m this notion is explained in 35 sec 2 4 using only algebraic methods the result below includes a weaker version of this conjecture when is galois theorem 3 17 is a more precise description of the inverse image in terms of the inertia group theorem 3 14 let x y be a surjective morphism of smooth varieties over a field k of characteristic 0 and let n be a holonomic dy module 1 assume that is smooth then n is semisimple if and only if n is semisimple and if n is simple then n is simple 2 if n is a semisimple connection then n is a semisimple connection 3 assume is finite if n is semisimple then n is semisimple and if n is simple then n is simple 4 assume that n is semisimple and ny is of finite type over oy y for all points y of height 1 such that the closure of y intersects the discriminant d i e y d 6 then n is semisimple remark 3 15 1 the assertion in theorem 3 14 2 will be extended in the orem 5 39 to arbitrary morphisms of smooth varieties for a certain class of connections 28 rolf ka llstro m 2 notice that if arises from a finite field extension l k then both 1 and 3 applies if dk is replaced by the subring k that is generated by a single derivation of k k then the assertion that l k n is semisimple if and only of n is semisimple also follows from 55 1 proposition 75 prop 2 7 3 in general n need not be semisimple when is finite and surjective and n is a simple holonomic module for example n can coincide with its maximal extension n i i n in the notation of the diagram bc implying that n j j n j 0 i n while j 0 i n 6 j 0 i n more concretely let a b be a finite map of smooth local k algebras x mb m 2 b and f a t be such that f x 0 and f 6 0 let f be the action of a derivation ta k on the coefficients of f then x f x f x and we get the da module n dax i am unaware of an algorithm given f to decide whether n is simple but if f tn y for some integer n 1 then we write n day 1 n which indeed is a simple module however n b x which is not semisimple proof of theorem 3 14 for the proof of 1 and 2 we factorize by a finite map f x z y k x and a projection p z y since f p it follows that it suffices to prove the assertions when is either finite or a projection and since p n is simple if and only if n is simple it suffices to consider finite morphisms 1 by the above discussion we can assume that is e tale and we have to prove that n is semisimple when n is simple then n is the minimal extension of a simple dy module n for some point in y i e in the notation of theorem 9 10 n n since is e tale it follows that n is a minimal extension n x 1 n x it suffices therefore to prove that the dx x module m n x is semisimple when x 1 let l 1 kx x and k ky be the residue fields at x and respectively since suppm mx x by kashiwara s equivalence it suffices to prove that m 0 m mx x is a semisimple dl 1 module we have m 0 l 1 k n 0 where n 0 n my since n is simple it follows again by kashiwara s equivalence that n 0 is a simple dk module select a field extension l l 1 k such that l k is galois with galois group g hence l l 1 is also galois and we let h denote its galois group in the notation of section 3 1 l k n 0 dl dk n 0 e dll dk n 0 and by proposition 3 4 dll dk n 0 is a semisimple dl g module hence by propo sition 3 6 1 l k n 0 is semisimple again since dll dk n 0 is a semisimple dl g module hence a semisimple dl h module 5 and m 0 dl 1 dk n 0 drl dl h dll dl 1 dl 1 dk n 0 drl dl h dll dk n 0 proposition 3 4 implies that m 0 is semisimple conversely if m 0 dl 1 dk n 0 is semisimple then dll dl 1 dl 1 dk n 0 is a dl g module which is semimple over dl h and therefore it is semisimple as dl g module too prop 3 6 hence by proposition 3 4 n 0 is semisimple since a dl g module is simple if its restriction to a dl h module is simple it follows from the above argument that n is simple when n is simple 5 this is proven in the same way as in the proof that e is a semisimple functor in proposi tion 3 6 1 d modules and finite maps 29 2 by generic smoothness of 1 implies that n is generically semisimple hence n is a connection that extends a semisimple dx 0 module on some open subset x 0 of x it follows that n is semisimple prop 9 13 3 the remaining part to prove that n is semi simple when n is semi simple is postponed until after theorem 3 21 4 assume that n is simple since x 0 y 0 is e tale by 1 it follows that j n 0 i n is semisimple when n is semisimple since ny is of finite type whenever y is a point of height 1 whose closure intersects d it follows that n x is of finite type over ox x when x is a point of height 1 whose closure intersects b proposition 9 13 now implies that n is semisimple as explained in 3 the proof that n is semisimple when n is semisimple and is finite is postponed to 3 4 since we first need to see that is a semisimple functor to prove this in turn we need the following special case of theorem 3 14 3 lemma 3 16 make one of the assumptions 1 n is coherent over ox 2 is a smooth map if n is semisimple then n is semisimple proof the case 2 is already covered by theorem 3 14 let 0 n 1 i n be an exact sequence we then get a diagram as detailed below n 1 tr n n 1 i v oo n u oo the assumptions 1 or 2 imply that n n this follows as soon as is non characteristic to n so that there exists an isomorphism f n n 1 and we therefore get the map f i the functor is exact since is flat and is exact due to proposition 2 10 hence is injective by the already proven part of theorem 3 14 1 2 the module n n is semisimple hence there exists a map n n 1 such that is the identity put j 1 n tr u n n 1 where n is the degree of the map since v u i we have j i 1 n tr u i 1 n tr v 1 n tr v idn 1 therefore n is semisimple we can give a more detailed description of the inverse image in terms of the inertia group when the map is galois in the formulation we refer to the diagram bc in 2 1 theorem 3 17 let x y be a finite morphism of smooth varieties such that the extension of fraction fields is galois with galois group g let n be a simple dy module such that i n 6 0 let m be a simple submodule of n gm be the inertia subgroup of m in g and put t g gm then j j n t i 1 gi m e for some integer e where gi are representatives of the cosets g gm if n is a connection or is smooth then one can erase j j on the left moreover 30 rolf ka llstro m 1 the integer e divides both the order gm of the inertia group and the degree of 2 rk n rk m divides the degree of we indicate how theorem 3 17 relates to clifford s theorem in the representation theory of finite groups so assume for a moment that there exists a field extension l 1 l k such that l 1 k is galois and l 1 k n le 1 for some integer e as dl 1 module in 5 5 it is explained how such dk modules n are closely related to representations of finite groups then l 1 l is also galois and we let g 1 and h be the galois groups of l 1 k and l 1 l so that g g 1 h is the galois group of l k the decomposition of n in theorem 3 17 now follows from theorem 5 31 and proposition 5 35 below by applying clifford s theorem to a normal subgroup see 4 49 proof consider first the restriction of to a map 0 specl speck then the restriction of m to specl is non zero we again denote this restriction by m if m dl li ni l kn for each element g in g g m is a simple dl module that can be identified with dl g li ni using this identification g g g m l k n is an inclusion of dl g modules since n is simple proposition 3 4 implies that the right side is simple over dl g hence the inclusion is an equality let s s 1 denote the multiplicity of a simple module s 1 in a module s we have by adjointness e 0 n g m 0 g m n 0 m n 0 n m where the third equality follows since g m m when restricted to dk module now the sum in can be reduced to a direct sum over representatives of g gm as stated and then taking minimal extensions from dl modules to dx modules this proves the first assertion if n is a connection or is smooth then n is semisimple th 5 39 so that j n n 1 we have e 0 m n dimk v th 3 27 for some gm and dimk v is a divisor of gm see 17 6 5 prop 17 the other assertion follows since gm g and deg g 2 put l 0 l gm and consider the factorisation specl q specl 0 p speck so that p q then there exists a simple dl 0 module n 0 such that p n 0 n and q n 0 m since rk n g gm rk n 0 it suffices to show that rk n 0 rk m divides g gm this follows from the first part of the theorem to the map q with t 1 so that rk n 0 rk m e and therefore the assertion follows from 1 6 by considering compositions of galois mappings we get the following analogue of a theorem due to ito and isaacs about representations of finite groups see 1 11 29 if one restricts to the case l below using the equivalence in theorem 5 31 it follows that it is equivalent to the ito isaacs result corollary 3 18 let n be a simple dk module and specl speck be a finite galois field extension such that n e for som integer e and dl module of rank 1 over l if can be factorised into field extensions k l 0 l 1 l 2 ln l such that each li li 1 is galois then rk n divides the degree l k 6 the proofs of theorem 3 27 and theorem 5 39 below do not depend on theorem 3 17 d modules and finite maps 31 proof since m e it follows that rk m 1 in theorem 3 17 and we can apply 2 to each successive extension li li 1 theorem 3 19 letm be a simple dx module where x specl put l 1 lgm and consider the factorization x p z q y q p corresponding to the field extensions l l 1 k where l k is galois put a nz p nz m 6 0 b ny ny m 6 0 1 if nz a then q nz is simple 2 the map nz q nz defines a bijection a b 3 if nz a and ny q nz then nz is the unique simple component of q ny that belongs to a 4 if q nz ny with nz a then p nz m ny m the proof below is quite parallel to a corresponding statement for characters of finite groups see 1 th 6 11 proof let nz a and ny be a simple dy module since 0 6 q nz ny q ny nz p nz m 6 0 we get ny m p q ny m 6 0 hence ny b by theorem 3 17 we have p nz m f and ny t gim e since q ny nz 6 0 we get f e now comparing dimensions of vector spaces e t rklm rkk ny rkk q nz t rkl 1 nz f t rklm f t rklm hence equality holds throughout in particular rkk ny rkk q nz and we conclude q nz ny this proves 1 also ny m e f q nz m which proves 4 statement 3 follows from the last equality since n 1 z a and n 1 z 6 nz and n 1 z is a constituent of q ny then ny m nz n 1 z m p nz m p n 1 z m p nz m which is a contradiction the map in 2 is well defined by 1 and its image lies in b by 4 it is one to one by 3 to prove that it maps onto b let ny b since m is a constituent of ny there must be some simple constituent nz of q ny with q nz ny 6 0 thus nz a and ny is a constituent of q nz therefore ny q nz and the proof is complete say that a dy module ny is primitive if it is not the direct image of another module with respect to a non trivial finite map more precisely if q nz ny for a finite morphism q z y and some module nz then q is an isomorphism corollary 3 20 if ny is a simple primitive module then ny m e where m is a dx module and e is some integer proof by theorem 3 17 ny t i 1 gim e and by theorem 3 19 ny q nz for some simple dz module nz since ny is primitive it follows that q id hence gm g and t 1 32 rolf ka llstro m 3 4 decomposition of direct images by equation 2 4 2 it follows that if m is semisimple and m has no torsion along the ramification locus b then the decomposition of m is determined by its decomposition over the e tale locus y 0 see bc in 2 1 if moreover j m is torsion free as ox 0 module and therefore 0 j m is torsion free the decomposition is determined by the decomposition of its restriction to the generic point of y and the decomposition at any other point is recovered from the minimal extension of m we first prove the semisimplicity theorem for general semisimple holonomic mod ules with finite support and later we describe this decomposition in terms of galois groups thms 3 27 and 3 35 when m is torsion free and is finite theorem 3 21 let x y be a morphism of smooth varieties and m be a semisimple holonomic dx module if suppm is finite over y then m is also semisimple corollary 3 22 if m is a simple holonomic module and n is a non zero simple constituent of m then suppn suppm proof it is evident that suppn suppm assume on the contrary that suppn 6 suppm we have homdy n m homdy m n homdx m n where the first equality follows since m is semisimple holonomic th 3 21 and the second is because of theorem 2 15 since supp n suppm 1 suppn suppm 6 suppm and m is simple it follows that n 0 notice that ifm is a non zero holonomic d module then the maximal semisimple submodule soc m the socle is non zero corollary 3 23 in the situation of theorem 3 21 assume that m is a holonomic module such that suppm is finite over y and which contains no section whose support is contained in the ramification locus b then soc m soc m i am uncertain whether it is necessary that m be torsion free along b at any rate the proof will show that if n is a simple submodule of m such that suppn 6 d the discriminant locus then n soc m before proving theorem 3 21 we use it to complete the proof of 3 in theo rem 3 14 7 proof of theorem 3 14 continued if n is semisimple theorem 3 21 implies that n is semisimple since the trace morphism tr n n is surjective see 2 6 1 this implies that n is semisimple let and let 0 n 1 n n 2 0 be an exact sequence of coherent dy modules since is flat we get the exact sequence 0 n 1 n n 2 0 since moreover is faithfully flat ni 6 0 if and only if ni 6 0 i 1 2 therefore if n is simple then n is simple the proof of theorem 3 21 is based on two lemmas for the first we refer to a proper morphism of smooth schemes of finite type over k x y and a point 7 the proof of theorem 3 21 does not rely on theorem 3 14 d modules and finite maps 33 in x that maps to in the scheme y put x specox and y specoy and let x y be the map that is induced by we get the diagram x j x y i y where j i lemma 3 24 as functors on hol dx we have j i proof we have canonical maps of functors j dxj dx 0 j j where the first is surjective and the second is injective therefore by proposi tion 2 10 we get j dxj dx 0 j j where again the first arrow is surjective and the second is surjective since j i and j i prop 2 15 we get the diagram i j i since i is characterized as the image of i i this implies that j i proof of corollary 3 23 the inclusion soc m soc m follows from theorem 3 21 and proposition 2 10 soc m soc m we refer to bc in 2 1 let n be a simple submodule of m the assumption that m has no torsion along b implies that n has no torsion along the discriminant locus d so that i n 6 0 since 0 is e tale it is easy to see that i n 0 soc j m finally by lemma 3 24 n i i n i 0 soc j m j soc j m soc m the proof of the next lemma is not presented until after theorem 3 27 where it will also be clear that there are no vicious circles see also 75 prop 2 7 treating the situation in remark 3 15 2 lemma 3 25 let specl speck be a finite field extension then m is semisimple proof of theorem 3 21 it suffices to prove that m is semisimple whenm is a simple holonomic dx module then suppm contains a unique generic point and m is the unique simple extension of the dx module m by generic smoothness and lemma 3 24 using the notation in m j m i m so it suffices to prove that m is semisimple let l denote the residue field of the point k be the residue field of p specl speck be the associated map of schemes and j 0 specl x and i 0 speck y be the inclusions of closed point in x and y by kashiwara s theorem m j 0 j o m j 0 m m where j 0 specl x is the inclusion of the closed point and m j 0 m m m m m m m 0 34 rolf ka llstro m is a semisimple dl module since j 0 i 0 p we have m i 0 p m again by kashiwara s theorem it suffices to see that p m is a semisimple dk module when m is a semisimple dl module this follows from lemma 3 25 remark 3 26 let specl speck be a finite field extension and m be an e tale trivial dl module so there there exists a field extension l 1 l k such l 1 k is galois and l 1 lm is isomorphic to ln 1 for some integer n put g gal l 1 k and h gal l 1 l by proposition 5 35 the decomposition of m can be determined by the decomposition of the induced representation ind g h v where v homdl 1 l 1 l 1 l m is a representation of h in general however no such finite field extension need to exist given a dl g m module m and a g m module v we get the dl g m module v km where the action is g g m agg v m g g m g v gag 1 g m ag dl ag 1 g g 1 agg see 3 2 for each gm and g m module v of class we put m v km g m homk g m v m theorem 3 27 assume that l k is galois with galois group g and that m is a simple dl module with true inertia group g m 1 if m is a simple dl module then m is isomorphic to a simple submodule of m 2 m is a semisimple dk g m module with decomposition m gm v km where the v km are simple dk g m modules which are mutually non isomorphic for different here dk acts only on the second factor m and g m acts only on the first factor v 3 the multiplicity and ranks are m m dimk v rankkm g gm dimk v ranklm the multiplicities m m divide the degree of the proof is given in 3 6 using the theorem we can first tie up a loose end proof of lemma 3 25 let l 1 l k be field extensions such that l 1 l and l 1 k are galois and g 1 be the galois group of l 1 k let 1 specl 1 speck be the corresponding map by lemma 3 16 l 1 lm is semisimple and by proposition 2 10 there exists an injective homomorphism m 1 l 1 lm here exactness is evident since specl 1 specl speck are smooth morphisms so it suffices to prove that the latter module is semisimple this follows from theorem 3 27 the dl module l is particularly interesting it is evidently a dl g module for any group g of automorphisms of l d modules and finite maps 35 corollary 3 28 let l be a field of finite type over k let g be a finite group of automorphisms of l and let k lg be the fixed field of g let specl speck be the morphism that is associated to the field extension k l then l g v k l where l homk g v l is a simple dk module of and v is the simple k g module of class g we have l l rankk l dimk v remarks 3 29 1 when l k arises from a morphism x y of smooth varieties we get a decomposition ox g v k ox where ox homk g v ox is a simple dy module 2 similarly to corollary 3 35 discussed below when l k is a finite non galois field extension the decomposition of l can be expressed as the h invariants l h of the decomposition of l where l is the galois cover of l k and h is the galois group of l l consider now a dl modulem that is also a dl gm module so that the cocycle f in section 3 2 is a coboundary implying that the decomposition of m is determined by the regular representation k gm as in theorem 3 27 putting l 1 lgm we have the morphisms p specl specl 1 and q specl 1 speck so that by proposition 3 4 m p n for some dl 1 module n where m is a simple dl gm module if and only if n is simple in this situation we also get that the direct image of a tensor products by n and certain other simple modules are simple proposition 3 30 in the notation above q l l n is a simple dk module for any simple component l of p l proof the projection formula which is evident in this case for the general case see 35 cor 1 7 5 corollary 3 28 and theorem 3 27 implies m q p l l 1 n g m v k q l l 1 n g m v km it follows that q l l 1 n m which is simple 3 5 the normal basis theorem assume that l k k are field extensions where l k is finite k k is of finite type and k is algebraically closed of characteristic 0 it follows from corollary 3 28 that if is an element in l then the following are equivalent 1 dk is simple 2 k g is simple if one instead asks that be a generator of l one arrives at a refinement of the normal basis theorem in this situation theorem 3 31 keep the assumption on l k k the following are equivalent for an element l 1 dk l 2 k g k g l 36 rolf ka llstro m moreover there exists such an element proof the existence of the element in 1 is a well known fact since l is a holonomic dk module and it is not essential that l k be galois see 74 for a construction of a cyclic vector from a k basis of l using only one derivation of k a non constructive but more generic proof is as follows the ring dk is simple and since k k has positive transcendence degree we have dimk dk so that for any element l l the map dk l p 7 pl is not an isomorphism then conclude from e g 38 lem 2 2 for a proof of the existence of an element as in 2 see 50 th 13 1 for the classical normal basis theorem 1 2 we have the following isomorphisms and inclusions of dk modules as detailed below g v k l l dk homk g k g dk homk g k g g v k l g homk g k g v k l the first and third equalities follow from the first part of corollary 3 28 the inclu sion map is that maps to the map 7 since the dk modules l are mutually non isomorphic it follows that v homk g k g v therefore the multiplicity of the simple module k k v in the semisimple k g submodule k g l satisifies dimk v k g k k v l k k v dimk v since again by corollary 3 28 l v k l k k v k l this implies 2 2 1 we have k g homdk dk l g homdk dk l k v where the inclusion map is determined by letting map to the map 7 and the equality follows from corollary 3 28 this implies the first inequality below dimk v l k k v k g k k v k g v dimkhomdk dk l dimkhomdk l l dimk v where multiplicites of k g modules occur in the second and third steps the sec ond inequality follows since l is a semisimple dk module therefore dk l dimk v so that dk l by corollary 3 28 3 6 proof of theorem 3 27 we have two dl g m modules dl g m dl m and k g m k m where on the first dl g m acts by multiplication from the left and on the second g m acts diagonally while dl acts only on the second factor in fact these modules are isomorphic lemma 3 32 let m be a dl g m module such that e m is a simple dl module 1 if v is a simple g m module then v km is a simple dl g m module 2 as dl g m modules dl g m dl e m k g m km gm v m km d modules and finite maps 37 where dl g m acts by multiplication from the left in the left side while on the other two terms g m acts diagonally and dl acts only on the right factor m the dl g m module v k m is simple where v is a simple g m module of dimension m proof 1 let n be a non zero simple submodule of v km and vi mi n be an element such that v 1 m 1 6 0 and the mi are linearly independent over k since e m is simple and k is algebraically closed by quillen s theorem 24 lem 2 6 4 enddl e m k hence by the density theorem there exists p dl such that pmi i 1 m 1 ij is the kronecker delta hence v 1 m 1 n since dl v 1 m 1 v 1 dlm 1 v 1 m it suffices now to prove that gv 1 m 1 n when g g m since this would imply n v km we have g v 1 m 1 gv 1 gm 1 n so that if gm 1 km 1 this is evidently true if gm 1 6 km 1 then by the density theorem there exists q dl such that q gv 1 gm 1 gv 1 q gm 1 gv 1 m 1 and therefore gv 1 m 1 n 2 define the map dl g m dl e m k g m km g m 7 g g m which is well defined since any element in dl g m dl m is a unique k linear combination of elements of the form g m now h g m ahh g m hg a hg 1 h m h g m hg hg a hg 1 h m h g m hg ah hg m h g m ah hg hg m h g m ahh g g m h g m ahh g m showing that is a homomorphism the map is clearly injective and since is a homomorphism of vector spaces over l of equal dimensions it follows that is an isomorphism the second isomorphism in 2 follows since k g gm v m the regular representation of g m and that v km is simple follows from 1 next lemma is similar to mackey s irreducibility criterion for induced representa tions 59 see also corollary 4 8 put g g m gm ggmg 1 and g g m 1 g g m see 3 2 1 so that if n is a semisimple dl g m module then both n and g n are dl g gm modules which by proposition 3 6 are semisimple lemma 3 33 let l k be a finite galois extension and n be a simple dl g m module make the following assumption homdl g gm n g n 0 in other words if g g gm then n and g n have no pairwise isomorphic simple component regarded as dl g gm modules then dl g dl g m n is a simple dl g module proof the asumption implies that the canonical map homdl g m n n homdl g dl g dl g m n dl g dl g m n homdl g m n dl g dl g m n is an isomorphism which implies the assertion since k is algebraically closed of characteristic 0 this follows from quillen s theorem see 24 lem 2 6 4 38 rolf ka llstro m the right action of dl g on dl g and right action of dl g m on dl g m gives homdl g m dl g dl g m a structure of dl g dl g m bimodule lemma 3 34 there exists an isomorphism as dl g dl g m bimodules dl g homdl g m dl g dl g m proof we only write down a sequence of natural isomorphisms leaving to the reader to work out the various actions of g m dl and dl g homdl g m dl g dl g m homdl dl g dl g m g m homdl dl g dl k k g m g m dl g k k g m g m homk g m k g m dl g homk g m k g m dl g dl g proof of theorem 3 27 a we can assume that m is a simple dl module so that by lemma 3 32 dl g m dl m gm v m km hence any simple dl g m submodule n of the above module is of the form v km where v is a simple g m module and thus e n nm for for some integer n let g g and assume that there exists a non zero homomorphism e n n m g e n n g m then m g m and therefore g gm hence there are no non trivial dl linear homomorphism when g 6 gm and hence no dl g gm linear ones either therefore the assumptions in lemma 3 33 are satisfied and hence dl g dl g m n is a simple dl g module b we now have as detailed below m drl dl g m dl g m dl m d r l dl g m gm v m km the first equality follows since m is formed simply as the restriction of the dl module m to the subring dk dl and since dl dl g m dl g m dl as dk dl bimodule the second equality follows from by a dl g dl g m v k m is a simple dl g module which by proposition 3 4 implies that the following dk module is simple drl dl g m v km d r l dl g dl g dl g m v km c we have isomorphisms as detailed below drl dl g m v km homdl g d l l dl g dl g m v km homdl g dll dl g dl g m v km homdl g dll homdl g m dl g dl g m dl g m v km homdl g dll homdl g m dl g v km homdl g m d l l v km v km g m homk g m v m m the first line is by the definition of the bimodule drl in section 3 1 the third follows from lemma 3 34 and the fifth line is by adjunction since v k m is the component of the g m modulem by b this completes the proof of 1 and 2 d modules and finite maps 39 3 the multiplicity m m m dimk v is clear put l 1 l gm so that we have field extensions p specl specl 1 q specl 1 speck and q p since m q p m gm v k q m gm v km we have m q m by theorem 3 17 p m m m and we have l 1 k g gm hence rankk m g gm rankl 1 m g gm m rankl m that m m dimk v divides deg g follows since dimk v divides g g z g see 17 6 5 prop 17 3 7 decomposition for general finite maps one really wants to decompose m for any finite map x y of smooth varieties not requiring that the fraction fields forms a galois field extension l k as in theorem 3 27 for this purpose we will use the galois cover l k of l k so that we get the map x y of where x is the integral closure of y in l the galois groups g and h of l k and l l act on the normal variety x so that y x g and x x h then p where p x x is the invariant map for the h action consider the diagram as detailed below x x y x r xr yr p r p 0 0 h 0 i the map r is inclusion of the smooth locus of x and h xr p x r x is the inclusion map so that codimx x x r 2 and codimx x xr 2 and let p 0 be the restriction of p the sheaf of rings dx r is locally generated by its first order differential operators hence the inverse image p 0 h m is a well defined dx r module 8 let m be a semisimple dx module then h m is again semisimple but since p 0 need not be a smooth p 0 h m need not be semisimple see example 3 15 moreover p 0 p 0 h m p 0 ox ox h m which again need not be a semisimple dxr module we therefore consider the socle of p 0 h m m soc p 0 h m it is clear that h belongs to the true inertia group g m of m by corollary 3 23 the canonical injective map h m p 0 p 0 h m results in a map h m soc p 0 p 0 h m p 0 m where the last equality follows from corollary 3 23 put now yr xr and let i yr y be the open inclusion where codimy y yr 2 and let 0 xr yr be the restriction of then since m is semisimple m i i m i 0 h m therefore the decomposition of m is entirely determined by the decomposition of the dyr module 0 h m in the notation above we now have 8 the ring d x needs not be generated by first order differential operators which is required to make sense of p m 40 rolf ka llstro m corollary 3 35 let m be a simple holonomic dx module such that suppm x and put let 0 m gm v k m be the decomposition in theorem 3 27 with respect to the map 0 then m gm v h k i m where v h v v h v v h h the multiplicities of the simple components are m i m dimk v h 1 h trh 1 h h h h where is the character of gm remark 3 36 when m is a simple module such that v suppm 6 x one still gets a similar decomposition as in corollary 3 35 using the galois cover of v but we leave this generalisation to the reader proof putmr h m which is a simpledxr module so thatmr p 0 p 0 mr h we then get a map as detailed below gm v h k i m gm i v k m h i 0 soc p 0 mr h i 0 p 0 p 0 mr h i 0 p 0 p 0 mr h i 0 mr h h m m the first equality follows since h acts trivially on m and the second is by theo rem 3 27 the map come by the inclusion of the socle in p 0 mr and because 0 p 0 note that h acts trivially on x and y so that 0 n h 0 n h when n is a dx h module this implies the equality on the second line the penultimate equality follows from lemma 3 24 and the ultimate is because m is simple with support x 4 more decompositions modules over liftable differential operators first we show that the vanishing trace module t ker tr l k for a finite field extensions contains no invariants with respect to the action of any non zero derivation and also give an easy condition for the simplicity of t in the galois case we give explicit projection operators onto both the isotypical and simple components of m knowing characters and matrices of representations respectively of the true inertia group of m see 3 2 1 next the composed functor p 1 p 2 is studied where p 1 and p 2 are finite morphisms with the same target using base change giving in particular a simplicity criterion for m this is related to two well known theorems by mackey in representation theory in the abelian case there are explicit decompositions of m and n the last subsection is concerned with the morphism m m of modules over the subring of liftable differential operators d y dy if is uniformly ramified then a semisimple decomposition of m induces a semisimple decomposition of m in the uniformly ramified sitation we also get more precise information about the isomorphism x y x 1 oy 1 y in proposition 2 2 4 1 about the vanishing trace module d modules and finite maps 41 4 1 1 no invariants letting l k be a finite field extension of characteristic 0 we have the decomposition l k t we show that if is a non trivial derivation of k then t 0 where t t t t 0 proposition 4 1 let l 1 l k be field extensions of characteristic 0 where l k is finite and l be the integral closure of k in l 1 let be a derivation of k and hence of l and 1 be an extension of to a derivation of l 1 then 1 l k k 2 if l 1 l 1 k 1 l 1 6 0 and 1 l 1 k then l 1 6 k that is if 1 l 1 k while l 1 6 k it follows that l 1 is transcendental over k 3 if k 6 k then t 0 4 l k l k k here the assertion 2 is well known proof 1 we have l k t prop 2 18 where the point is that t is a dk submodule if l a b where a k and b t then a k and b t hence if l k then b 0 2 assume that l 1 k k and l 1 6 0 let p k x be the minimal polynomial p l 1 0 one checks that that q p p l 1 k x is non zero since q 0 and deg q deg p this gives a contradiction therefore l 1 6 k 3 take a k such that a 6 0 and assume that b t satisfies b 0 if b 6 0 then l a b 6 k and l k therefore a l 0 by 2 which gives a contradiction hence b 0 4 this follows from 2 4 1 2 simple vanishing trace module one can ask when the vanishing trace part t in the decomposition ox oy t is simple this is a generic property so we can just as well again assume that is a finite field extension and corollary 3 35 immediately gives a characterization of this property in terms of representations of galois groups corollary 4 2 let l k be a finite field extension where k is a finite transcen dence over the base field k let l k be a galois cover with galois group g and h be the galois group of l l the following are equivalent 1 t is a simple dk module 2 there exists only one non trivial irreducible representation v of g such that the h invariant space v h 6 0 and for this representation we have dimk v h 1 combining with the classical branching rule for the symmetric group results we now explain an application of corollary 4 2 let x spec k x 1 xn be the affine n space let the symmetric group sn act by permutating the variables and sn 1 be the subgroup that fixes the variable xn put x x sn 1 y x sn and let x y be the map induced by the inclusion of invariant rings k x 1 xn sn k x 1 xn sn 1 let tr l k x 1 xn sn 1 k lsn be the trace morphism so that t ox ker tr here we use the canonical inclusion ox ox p 7 p tr 1 1 to form the intersection define the polynomial n n 1 xn n 1 i 1 xi 42 rolf ka llstro m corollary 4 3 we have ox oy t where t is a simple dy module we have n t so that t dy n proof the branching rule for the inclusion sn 1 sn can be described in terms of young diagrams and removable boxes there is only one young diagram of size n that does not correspond to the trivial representation of sn and which moreover contains a removable box such that the remaining young diagram of size n 1 corresponds to the trivial representation this is a hook where the first row is of length 2 therefore the condition 2 in corollary 4 2 is satisfied so that t is simple it remains to see that n t since then we get t dy n let l be the fraction field of k x 1 xn and trl l trl k be the trace of l l and l k respectively since xn and n 1 i 1 xi are sn 1 invariant it follows that trl l xn n 1 xn trl l n 1 i 1 xi n 1 n 1 i 1 xi moreover trl k xi sn xi n 1 n j 1 xj trl k n 1 i 1 xi n 1 n 1 n i 1 xi where the first line implies the second since trl k trl k trl l it follows that ntrl k n trl k n 0 remark 4 4 the result also follows by applying 40 prop 5 4 the latter result also shows that m is multiplicity free wheneverm is a simple dl module such that l l m l m for some integer m as dl module the element n is the young polynomial that corresponds to the hook shaped young tableaux where the first row contains the elements 1 n 4 2 explicit decomposition for galois morphisms let v be the dual of a finite dimensional k vector space of dimension n forming an irreducible represen tation of g m corresponding to gm and let also denote the corresponding character of v put nm g m and after selecting a basis of v let r t be the matrix of the action of an element t on v set p n nm t g m t t and p n nm t g m r t 1 t defining k linear maps m m where on the right t denotes the natural action on m moreover p is dk g m linear while p is dk linear put m im p and m im p theorem 4 5 make the same assumptions as in theorem 3 27 1 the map p is a projection m m and m v km the mod ule m is the isotypical component of m both regarded as k g m module and as dk module 2 the map p is a projection map of dk modules it is zero on m when 6 its image m is contained in m and m is the direct sum of the m for 1 n we have p p d modules and finite maps 43 3 the map p is zero on the m 6 as well as on the m for 6 it defines an isomorphism of dk modules from m onto m 4 let m 1 be an element 6 0 of m 1 and let m p 1 m 1 m the m generate a k vector subspace v m 1 of m stable under g m and of dimension n for each s g m we have s m r s m in particular v m 1 is isomorphic to v 5 if m 1 1 m n 1 is a basis of m 1 we have a decomposition m n 1 v m 1 into simple k g m modules all isomorphic to v m 1 and m n 1 m into simple dk modules remark 4 6 the decomposition m m is canonical where the modules m are simple dk g m modules of multiplicity 1 while the decomposition in 5 is non canonical any semisimple decomposition of an isotypical component m m regarded as dk module is determined explicitly by the projection operators described above by selecting a basis of v proof we regard m as a dk g m module of finite dimension as vector space over k by theorem 3 27 we have the semisimple dk module m gmv k m where the v k m are simple mutually non isomorphic simple dk g m modules so that the isotypical component both as dk and k g m module is v km the proof can now be read off from the proof of 17 thm 8 and prop 8 note that we are working with a dual representation 4 3 composition of direct and inverse images we consider the setup specl specli pi speck where l li k i 1 2 are finite field extensions and k k is a field extension of a finite transcendence degree over a field k of characteristic 0 let qi spec l 1 k l 2 specli be the projection maps and sj specl j r j 1 specl j spec l 1 k l 2 be the inclusion of the irreducible components specl j where l j l are certain subfields that contain both l 1 and l 2 put rj q 2 sj specl j specl 2 and lj q 1 sj specl j specl 1 next result is in the spirit of mackey s restriction theorem for group representations see also proposition 5 36 if g aut l k and h 1 h 2 are subgroups of g we let s be a set of representa tives of the double cosets h 1 g h 2 for each s s put h s sh 2 s 1 h 1 h 1 let ls specl h s specl 1 be defined by the inclusion of l 1 in lh s the map h s h 2 x 7 s 1 xs determines a homomorphism rs speclh s specl 2 theorem 4 7 let m be a dl 2 module 44 rolf ka llstro m 1 p 1 p 2 m r j 1 lj rj m 2 assume that l li i 1 2 and l k are galois and h 1 h 2 be subgroups of g such that li l h 1 then as dl 1 modules p 1 p 2 m s s ls r s m s s lh s l 2 m 3 make the assumptions in 2 and assume moreover that li k i 1 2 are galois let l 12 l 1 l 2 be the compositum of l 1 and l 2 then p 1 p 2 m s s ls r s m s s l 12 l 2 m s where l 12 l 2 m s is l 12 l 2 m as vector space over k the dl 12 action is p l m p s l m p s sps 1 and the dl 1 action is determined by the inclusion dl 1 dl 12 4 assume that specl speck is galois with galois group g if m is a dl module then m g g mg where mg is the twisted dl module see 3 2 proof 1 we have that rj 1 sj s j is the identity operation so that by the base change theorem here simply stating that l 2 k l 1 l 1 m l 2 k m p 2 p 1 m q 1 q 2 m r j 1 q 1 sj s jq 2 m r j 1 q 1 sj q 2 sj m r j 1 lj r j m 2 define the homomorphism lh 1 k lh 2 s s lh s x y 7 xsys 1 s s where we note that lh 1 lh s and x 7 sxs 1 defines a map h s h 2 and therefore a map lh 2 lh s x 7 sxs 1 to see that is an isomorphism it suffices to see that it induces an isomorphism of k vector spaces as k vector spaces we have lh 1 k h 1 g lh 2 k g h 2 and lh s k g h s we can now factor by natural maps k h 1 g k k g h 2 a s s k g 1 s b s s k g h s x y 7 x sy s 1 s s where it is straightforward to see that a and b define isomorphisms of k vector spaces the assertion now follows from 1 where l s lh s 3 now h s h 1 h 2 and we have isomorphisms l 12 l h 1 h 2 l s x 7 sxs 1 this isomorphism also induces an isomorphism dl 12 dl s p 7 p s sps 1 now the assertion follows from 2 4 here h 1 h 2 e are trivial groups so the assertion follows from 3 d modules and finite maps 45 there is also a counterpart to mackey s irreducibility criterion which at the same time expands the scope of proposition 3 9 let specl speck be a finite field extension of positive transcendence degree over k and characteristic 0 and let spec l speck be a galois cover of with galois group g let h be the galois group of l l s be a set of representatives of h g h and put h s shs 1 h for s s below we regard l h s l m as a dl module by the inclusion l lh s corollary 4 8 let m be a simple dl module of finite dimension over l the following conditions are equivalent 1 m is simple 2 the dl modules m and l h s l m are disjoint for each s s h so that homdl m l h s lm 0 proof we can work in the grothendieck group k 1 of d modules using the natural pairing k 1 z k 1 z determined by requiring for simple modules ni that n 1 n 2 equals 1 when n 1 n 2 and otherwise 0 then m is simple if and only if m m 1 by adjointness and proposition 4 7 2 with h h 1 h 2 being the galois group of l l and p 1 p 2 we get m m m m s s m l h s lm 1 s s h m l h s lm this implies the assertion 4 4 abelian extensions it can be difficult to compute the central extension g m of the intertia group gm g of a simple dl module m corresponding to a galois extension specl speck with galois group g and then also its irreducible representations v gm appearing in theorem 3 27 suppose now instead that we know one simple constituent n of m and also the complete decomposition l g v k l then n l k n g v k l k n so that if m is a simple component of n then each simple module in m is isomorphic to a submodule of some l kn here the latter module is semisimple but need not be simple when is non abelian proposition 4 9 assume that specl speck is abelian and m be a simple holonomic dl module there exist integers m and e such that 1 m m i 1 l i k n e where l k n are simple dk modules here n is a simple submodule of m and the l i are simple submodules of l 2 e 2 m gm the order of the inertia group of m 3 rankk n rankl m e m and rankk l 1 46 rolf ka llstro m proof in this situation l k n is simple since n is simple and rankk l dimv 1 therefore for some integers m m l n m where the sum runs over certain g moreover l k n l l n l l n n hence the multiplicity m m l k n n m e is independent of thus by theorem 4 7 4 g gm gm mg g g mg m m i 1 g g gm m e 2 g so that equaling the multiplicity of m in both sides we get gm e 2 m proving 2 also 3 is now evident example 4 10 kummer extensions consider the field extension k l k a 1 n 1 a 1 n r where ai algebraically independent elements in k it can be factorized into cyclic extension i ki 1 k a 1 n 1 a 1 n i 1 ki k a 1 n 1 a 1 n i then putting xi a 1 n i l 1 r 1 r l 1 r 1 n 1 i 0 dkr 1 xir 1 r 2 r 1

of the module it gives a more precise result than in theorem 3 17 given field extensions specl speck r speck 0 put p r and let g gr and gp denote the corresponding galois groups assume that and r are galois so that g is a normal subgroup of gp and gr gp g say that is minimal galois with respect to r if for any field k l 1 l such that l 1 k 0 is galois it follows that l 1 l or l 1 k as before if n is a dk module let gn be its inertia subgroup in aut l k theorem 4 11 assume that g is abelian and n be a simple holonomic dk module such that its inertia group gn contains g assume moreover that is minimal galois with respect to r speck speclg then one of the following holds 1 n is simple 2 n m e where m is simple and e 2 deg gm 3 n g g mg where m is simple and mg 6 mg when g 6 g d modules and finite maps 47 proof let gm be the inertia group in g of a simple module m in n by theorem 3 17 n t i 1 gi m e where t g gm and e divides gm since gm g is normal in the abelian group g it follows that l gm is galois over lg by the minimality condition either lgm l or lm k in the first case gm 1 and thus t g and e 1 corresponding to 3 in the latter case gm g implying 2 or 1 corollary 4 12 if the galois group g is of prime order p and n is a simple dk module then either 1 n is simple 2 n p i 1 ni where ni 6 nj when i 6 j proof here l k is minimal galois relative to k k so one can apply theo rem 4 11 where case 2 cannot occur since g p is not a square remark 4 13 taken together with the equivalence theorem 5 31 below the above results imply corresponding assertions in clifford theory 1 th 6 18 cor 6 19 but notice that the scope of the above result is greater since the dk modules need not arise from irreducible representation of a finite group 4 5 decomposition over liftable differential operators we have the subring d y of liftable differential operators in dy 2 2 and for any coherent dx module m we can define the map 4 5 1 m m m m 7 1 1 m where is described in equation 2 3 4 proposition 4 14 the map m is a homomorphism of d y modules on the e tale locus m is an isomorphism of dy 0 modules proof clearly both sides in the map are left d y modules if is a liftable deriva tion then 1 1 m 1 1 m see also remark 2 7 therefore the restriction of m to y 0 is a homomorphism of modules over the ring d y 0 d t y 0 ifm dx then dx x y 1 oy 1 dy x y oy dy and we have the map dx x y oy dy p 7 i tr pi where a locally defined section inx over y i pi ox 1 oy 1 dy diff 1 oy ox is the differential operator that is induced by section p of dx since the action of a section of d y on a section of either side of the map is determined by its restriction to y 0 and we know that the restriction of to y 0 is a homomorphism it follows that is a homomorphism of d y modules therefore the assertion follows when m is locally free over dx since any coherent dx module is locally provided with a finite locally free resolution locally the cat egory of coherent dx modules is of finite global homological dimension and the map m is functorial inm it follows that m is a homomorphism for any coherent m finally d y 0 dy 0 so the restriction of m is a morphism of dy 0 modules 0 m i m 0 j m i m 0 j m it is easy to see that this is an isomorphism when m dx and again since m is functorial in m it follows that 0 m is an isomorphism whenm is a connection it can be more natural to study theoy coherent module m than m where the latter tends to be non coherent when is ramified 48 rolf ka llstro m on the other hand the ring d y is not easy to get a grip on 9 however when x y is fairly close to being an invariant map x xg generators of d y admit a direct construction and we shall see that in certain cases the semisimple decomposition of m induces a semisimple decomposition of m as d y module say that a morphism x y is uniformly ramified if for any prime divisor d on y we have 1 d s i 1 riei where r 1 rs 10 this condition is good for ensuring a nice galois cover x x y of as noted by f knop 46 see also 3 1 and 3 7 uniformly ramified morphisms naturally occur as galois extensions x y and more generally as factorizations x x y where x x h and h is a subgroup of the galois cover x x y of x y that does not contain any pseudo reflections it turns out that any uniformly ramified morphism is of this form let d x and d x 11 be the graded commutative rings associated to the order filtrations of the rings d y dx proposition 4 15 the following are equivalent for a finite morhism x y of smooth varieties 1 is uniformly ramified 2 the induced map x x is e tale and x is smooth under these equivalent conditions we have 1 d y dgx and dx d h x 2 d y is a simple ring 3 d x is of finite type over d x and dx is finitely generated over d y assume that a b is an inclusion of graded rings where b is a polynomial ring such that x specb speca is uniformly ramified then the galois cover b b gives a map a b where a b g for a finite group g so that generators of d a d a are given as in 53 th 5 and 46 th 7 3 proof see 46 prop 3 3 for the assertion that is uniformly ramified if and only if x x is unramified in codimension 1 since x is normal and x is smooth it follows from zariski nagata s purity theorem that x x is e tale and as x is smooth it follows that x is smooth the remaining assertions are explained in loc cit by proposition 4 15 3 ifm is a coherentdx module then m is a coherent d y module if m is a connection along the ramification locus we can be more precise theorem 4 16 let x y be a uniformly ramified morphism of smooth varieties and m be a simple dx module which generically is non zero and of finite type over fraction field of x assume also that the stalk mx is of finite type over ox x when x is a generic point of the ramification locus b let m mnii be a semisimple decomposition th 3 21 where the mi are simple dy modules and put ni 1 mi m then m nnii where the ni are simple d y modules 9 this is in contrast to the ring generated by the easily described liftable tangent vector fields t y ty id formed as the vector fields that preserve the ideal of the disciminant for a discussion of t y see 39 and references therein 10 this notion was also employed in 39 for a different purpose 11 we use the notation in loc cit d modules and finite maps 49 remark 4 17 1 in 40 we study d y submodules of ox for invariant maps x xg of a finite group g acting linearly on an affine space x an 2 question are the d y modules ni of finite length or even simple when m is a torsion free holonomic dx module proof let n 0 i be a non zero submodule of the d y module ni and put n i ni n 0 i so that by proposition 4 14 supp n i d assuming d is non empty let y be a point in the discriminant d since is uniformly ramified we have 1 y b 1 y implying in particular that mx is of finite type when the height ht x 1 and x b and hence mx is of finite type for all points of height 1 in b since m is simple it follows that mx is of finite type for any point x in b hence m y is of finite type over oy y for all points y in d hence n i y is a d y y module that is of finite type over oy y moreover annoy y n i y is a non zero 2 sided ideal of the simple ring d y prop 4 15 since is uniformly ramified hence annoy y n i y d y y this implies that n i y 0 when y d and hence n i 0 proposition 2 2 can be made more precise when the morphism is uniformly ram ified corollary 4 18 let x y be a uniformly ramified morphism of smooth va rieties the homomorphism in proposition 2 2 induces an isomorphism of constant sheaves of rank 1 homd y ox oy homd y y x where on the right left d y acts on x y from the right left the section in s is a global section of homd y y x homd y 1 y x x ox y and forms a basis of the constant sheaf proof it remains only to prove that is an isomorphism of constant sheaves of rank 1 let dk denote vector space dual over k we have as detailed below homd y ox oy homdy ox oy homdk l k homdk d k k dk l homdk k l ltk k k the first equality follows from theorem 4 16 the second since l andk are semisim ple dk modules and letting j be the inclusion of the generic point in y the func tor j fully faithful and we have j l ox and j k oy the third equality follows since dk is an equivalence of categories and the fourth follows since dk l l and dk k k the last equality follows from lemma 5 30 below since k is algebraically closed in k applying the functor k k from left to right dk modules so that l k kl we get homdk k l homdk k l one can now work backwards to arrive at the right side of the isomorphism 5 covering d modules say that a dl module m 1 is diagonalizable if there exists an isomorphism m 1 i i where the modules i are of rank 1 50 rolf ka llstro m definition 5 1 let x be a smooth variety with fraction field k ox a dx module m is a covering module if it is torsion free over ox and there exists a finite field extension l k such that m 1 l k m is diagonalizable let modcov x be the category of covering modules on a smooth variety x a monomial module is of the form for some finite map and simple dx module of generic rank 1 when the modules i all are isomorphic to l we say that m is generically l e tale trivial or isotrivial meaning that that m has a complete set of algebraic solutions in l moreover if l k is a finite galois extension with galois group g it is well known that the category of l e tale trivial dk modules is equivalent to the category of k linear representations of a finite group g this picard vessiot equivalence is described in 5 5 the differential galois group of a covering dk module is an extension of a finite group by a product of multiplicative groups any covering module m is generically semisimple th 3 14 and its socle is the minimal extension from the generic point if the integral closure xm x of x in l is smooth and m i then the socle is contained in i so that in particular any simple covering module is a submodule of a monomial module 12 moreover the category concov x of connections that are also covering modules is semisimple th 5 37 where the category of e tale trivial connections conet x forms a semisimple subcategory monomial modules are a great source of covering modules on the other hand it is a very challenging problem to determine for which parameters a module m dx i is e tale trivial given a parametrized left ideal i of dx for easy examples consider finite surjective maps to the complex line x c and t be a coordinate of c let dc be the ring of algebraic differential operators in the variable t and m dc dc t t e dc dc t 1 the module m is generically invertible and if t belongs to the function field of x it is also generically trivial m is e tale trivial if and only if is a rational number the module e is a generically invertible simple non trivial d module that is not e tale trivial when k k t then any semisimple dk module is a covering module 55 we mention also the classical problem studied by schwarz fuchs and klein to determine the e tale trivial rank 2 connections on the projective line con 2 et p 1 c s con 2 p 1 s where s i a finite set of points in p 1 c the case s 3 results in the famous schwarz list of e tale trivial hypergeometric modules dpc modules and for general finite subsets s of a smooth projective curve c a decision procedure is devised in 22 23 based on klein see references in loc cit for a connection over c s to be e tale trivial and stress that one needs in particular to decide when connections of rank 1 are e tale trivial therefore as a tiny first step to understand why a connection belongs conet x it is described how one can determine the e tale trivial objects in its subcategory i x con 1 x of connections of rank 1 also when dimx 1 see 5 3 the whole category i x the basic covering modules is studied in section 5 2 and its set of isomorphism classes is described in theorem 5 19 when x is affine in terms of a smooth completion now in some sense the simplest objects in i k i speck are the exponential ones where k k is a finitely generated field extension and in this context a classical theorem by liouville is extended by describing the objects m i k such that l km dle l for some elementary field extensions l k i e m becomes exponential after pulling back to l th 5 28 12 if xm is non smooth then one can take a resolution p x m xm so that the socle of m belongs to the torsion free part of p i for some simple invertible dx m modules i d modules and finite maps 51 5 1 global sections of differential forms and connections on a projective variety since closed 1 forms on a projective variety x are important for the struc ture of d modules that are of rank 1 over ox we insert a general result about the cohomology of closed forms on x which can be regarded as a natural extension of the hodge decomposition theorem there is no claim for essential originality since the proof relies on the usual hodge theorem in particular global 1 forms on x are closed and we show also that global sections of a connection on x are constant it was surprising not to find the latter assertion in the literature though it must be known and although the former is well known it was frustrating not to find an algebraic argument 5 1 1 global sections of differential forms let m cl x be the subsheaf of closed m forms in mx where we single out the sheaf of closed 1 forms cl x 1 cl x x theorem 5 2 1 if x k is a smooth projective variety then global m forms are closed x mx x m cl x 2 let x c be a smooth complex projective variety and m cl xa be the sheaf of closed m forms on the corresponding complex analytic ka hler manifold xa then hn xa m cl xa j m i j n m hi x j x clearly 0 cl x is flasque and n cl x n x when n dimx but a description of hn x m cl x when 0 m n and n 1 is more complicated due to the fact that the algebraic de rham complex is not acyclic proof 1 by the lefschetz principle one can reduce to the case k c so that x can also be regarded as a compact ka hler manifold and as such it is again denoted xa we have isomorphisms x mx xa mxa xa m cl xa where the first is a consequence of g a g a and it is well known that holomorphic forms on a compact ka hler manifold are closed if a global algebraic 1 form whose associated complex analytic 1 form is closed then it is closed also as algebraic 1 form 2 we first prove the assertion in the theorem with indices a attached to the identities where xa can be any compact ka hler manifold the proof is by induction over m where in the case m 0 and all n 0 we have the usual hodge decomposition hn xa c hn xa xa i j n i 0 j 0 hi xa j xa assume by induction that hn xa r cl xa j r i j n r hi xa j xa when r m and all n 0 to prove the assertion when r m for all n 0 we use induction in n where the case n 0 follows from 1 by poincare s lemma for the complex analytic de rham complex for each integer m 1 we have the exact sequence 0 m 1 clxa m 1 xa m clxa 0 52 rolf ka llstro m and hence a long exact sequence 0 xa m 1 clxa xa m 1 xa xa m clxa h 1 xa m 1 cl xa hn 1 xa m 1 clxa amn 1 hn 1 xa m 1 xa h n 1 xa m cl xa bmn 1 hn 1 1 xa m 1 clxa h n 1 1 xa m 1 xa assume by induction that holds when r m and n n 1 this implies that the map amn 1 is surjective so that b m n 1 is injective and we get the exact sequence 0 hn 1 xa m clxa h n 1 1 xa m 1 cl xa hn 1 1 xa m 1 xa where by induction hn 1 1 xa m 1 cl xa j m 1 i j n 1 m hi xa j xa implying that we can add 0 to the right this implies that the assertion also holds for r m and n n 1 finally by g a g a one can erase a from the right side of 5 1 2 connections on projective varieties and their global sections given a finite dimensional vector space v over k we get the trivial connection ox k v where v v tx ox v v proposition 5 3 let m be a connection on a normal projective variety x over an algebraically closed field k 1 there exists a projective morphism of smooth varieties x x such that m is a trivial connection 2 let v x m be the space of global sections then ox k v is isomor phic to a trivial subconnection of m on x the following are equivalent a m is a trivial connection b dimk v rankm of course it then follows that b implies dimk v rankm proof 1 the fraction fieldk ofx is finitely generated over k since dimkmk there exists a field extension l k the picard vessiot extension for the dk module mk where l is finitely generated over k ml l k mk lm as dl module and m rankm dimkmk by a standard construction there exists a map 1 x 1 x of normal projective varieties inducing the field inclusion k l as the inclusion of fraction fields one can resolve the singularities of x 1 by a birational projective map p x x 1 from a smooth projective variety x and we put 1 p then m is a connection that it generically trivial hence it is trivial prop 9 13 m ox kw where tx w 0 and x m w since k is algebraically closed 2 since v maps injectively into w and l k is separable so that derivations of k can be lifted to derivations of l defined modulo k linear derivations of l it follows that tk v 0 this implies that ox k v is a trivial subconnection of m the equivalences a b should now also be clear there is also a relative version proposition 5 4 let x y be a smooth projective morphism of smooth varieties over an algebraically closed field then the direct image defines a functor con x con y m 7 m d modules and finite maps 53 if m is a semisimple connection and is finite e tale theorem 4 16 implies that m is a semisimple connection it follows from the proof that the connection m is the same as the lowest homology group of the full direct image h d m h d r x y m d where x y m denotes the relative de rham complex a gauss manin connec tion proof denote by m the image of the canonical injective map 1 m m and let i xy x be the embedding of a fibre which is smooth since is smooth over a closed point y y so that ky y k and i m is a connection on xy by proposition 5 3 i tx y m txy ky y i m txy ky y xy i m 0 therefore tx y m 0 where tx y is the subsheaf of relative derivations in tx since is smooth we have the exact sequence 0 tx y tx d ty 0 so that if is a local section of ty there exists locally in x a section in tx such that d and by it follows that if is another such lift then m 0 therefore we have an action of ty on m which gives m a structure of connection as it is moreover well known that m is coherent over oy 5 2 d modules of rank 1 let j x 0 x be an open inclusion of smooth varieties where x is projective and d x j x 0 is a divisor then if m is a connection on x 0 it follows that j m is a coherent dx module and also a coherent ox d module we are interested in the case when rk m 1 and x 0 is affine 13 we want to classify such connections by decomposing closed 1 forms x 0 cl x 0 x clx d on x 0 into a sum of logarithmic forms on x with poles along d exact forms and a number g of such closed forms with vanishing residues along d where g dimkh 1 x ox 5 2 1 generalities we first recall a well known fact lemma 5 5 any dx module which is locally free of rank 1 as ox module is simple proof let m be a dx module that is of rank 1 and n be a non zero coherent submodule then n is a dx module which is coherent over ox hence it is locally free as ox submodule and also a submodule of the locally free module m of rank 1 therefore m n is a coherent torsion module over ox which moreover is a dx module therefore m n 0 let i x or con 1 x be the category of connections on x that are of rank 1 this is a group in categories where the sum of two objects m 1 m 2 i x is m 1 ox m 2 and the dx action is the diagonal one each object in i x is simple and we denote by i x the set of isomorphism classes of simples 13 a sufficient condition for x 0 to be affine is that d be the support of an effective ample divisor but in general x 0 being affine needs not imply that x x 0 is the support of an effective and ample divisor 28 54 rolf ka llstro m let clx be the sheaf of closed 1 forms and o x the sheaf of invertible elements in ox there is then a distinguished triangle 5 2 1 o x dlog clx cl 1 where the cone 14 of dlog is cl cl x cone dlog o x clx o x 1 clx we have also the distinguished triangle ox d clx cd 1 and when xa is a complex analytic manifold there is third distinguished triangle oxa exp o xa c a e 1 where cae 2 iz 1 replacing x by xa in the two previous triangles we have cal c 1 and cd c 1 and we get three distinguished triangles where any two have a common vertex and d dlog exp by the octahedral axiom for triangulated categories there is then also a distinguished triangle for complexes of sheaves on analytic sheaves cae cad cal 1 which is isomorphic to the triangle 2 izza 1 cxa 1 exp c xa 1 1 the cohomology of 5 2 1 gives a fragment of a long exact sequence 0 k x o x dlog x clx r 0 x cl resx h 1 x o x 5 2 2 c h 1 x clx where k r 1 x cl is the multiplicative group of the algebraic closure of k in the fraction field k of x a motivation for the notation resx will appear in remark 5 21 let pic x be the subgroup of the picard group consisting of invertible sheaves with vanishing rational first chern class the following proposition is well known proposition 5 6 1 i x r 0 x cl x clx dlog x o x ker c 2 if the divisor class group is trivial cl x 0 then i x x 1 cl x dlog x o x 3 if xa is a complex analytic manifold then i xa h 1 xa c xa hom

theorem 5 19 i x d is compared to i x as in 4 when d is a divisor 14 here o x 1 and cl x are placed in degrees 1 and 0 see 45 for generalities about triangu lated categories d modules and finite maps 55 proof 1 if ui is an affine covering of x i clui where mui dui i and i i i it follows that if uij ui uj then i uij j uij dlog ij for some ij o ui uj therefore i ij defines a cech 0 cocycle of cl the second equality follows from 5 2 1 2 here h 1 x o x 0 so the assertion follows from 1 3 since cal c xa 1 the first equality follows from 1 which also holds with x replaced by xa the remaining two equalities are also well known 4 in the exact sequence 5 2 2 dlog 0 so it suffices to see that the image of resx equals pic x to prove this in turn it seems that one needs to employ the lefschetz principle g a g a and hodge theory so we assume k c and work with the associated complex analytic space xa by g a g a pic x pic xa c 1 1 h 2 xa 2 iz t where c 1 h 1 xa o x h 2 xa 2 iz is the map occurring in the exponential sequence and the index t denotes the torsion subgroup we have ker c ker h 1 x o h 2 xa c ker h 1 xa o xa h 2 xa 2 iz h 2 xa c pic xa let specx specy be a finite morphism

locally exponential in the zariski topology on a variety x then it is globally exponential i e there exists x ox such that m dxe in particular if m is a rank 1 connection an a projective variety x that is locally exponential then m ox remark 5 8 it follows from the proof that the locally exponential dxa modules are classified by the cohomology group h 1 xa cxa where now xa is a complex analytic manifold the following lemma is close to 68 prop 4 lemma 5 9 let a be a smooth k algebra and ci be a linearly independent subset of k where k is regarded as vector space over the rational numbers q then if i a i ci dlog i da 0 in particular da q dloga 0 56 rolf ka llstro m proof if d i ci dlog i and is a discrete valuation of the fraction field k of a then by proposition 5 12 i cires dlog i i ci i 0 since ci is linearly independent it follows that i 0 for all this implies that i belongs to the algebraic closure k of k in k and therefore dlog i 0 proof of proposition 5 7 if i ox ui are local functions such that mui duie i then d i j dlog ij for some ij o x ui uj by lemma 5 9 it follows that d i j 0 hence i j ij where ij belongs to the algebraic closure of k of k in k lem 5 29 now the constant sheaf k x is flasque so there exist i k x ui such that ij j i and therefore the sections i i glue to a global section in x ox 5 2 3 higher dimensional residues we will later decompose clx d inte an expo nential and logarithmic component and analyse the logarithmic component using residues k saito introduced and studied the notion of logarithmic forms along arbitrary reduced divisors d in a complex manifold 81 extending similar constructions by delinge 15 we will further extend saito s treatment by defining logarithmic forms and a residue operation also for closed differentials relative to any discrete valuation of a field using the classical constructions for curves we are here only interested in 1 forms and work algebraically let id be the ideal of the reduced divisor d on a normal variety x which is regarded as a scheme proposition 5 10 assume id x hx for some function h and let x x x d the following are equivalent 1 hx x x x and hxd x 2 x x 2 x x hx where x x x and d x dlog hx x 2 x x 3 there exists gx ox x that is not a zero divisor in od x such that gx x a dlog hx x where a ox x and x x x the proof is similar to 81 1 the sheaf x logd of logarithmic differentials is the subsheaf of sections in x d that satisfy the above equivalent conditions 1 3 at all points x now let k z be a discrete valuation of the finitely generated field extension k k r r be the corresponding discrete valuation subring of k and kr r mr its residue field let r be the mr adic completion of r and k be the fraction field of r let k r r be a coefficient field so that if t is a uniformising parameter for r then r k r t k k r t and we have an identification kr r mr r t k r the modules of differentials r k r and r k are not separated in the mr adic topology and are moreover not of finite dimension while the separated modules r kr r k r mnr r k r r dt and r k r k mnr r k r r r k 15 deligne assumed that d be a divisor with at most normal crossing singularities d modules and finite maps 57 are of dimension 1 and tr degk k respectively the usual residue map is defined by res k kr k r r k r k dt kr a 7 a 1 where a i ait i k ai kr the element a 1 is independent of the choice of uniformising parameter as is described in 82 and 84 for the given choice of coefficient field now the exact sequence 0 k k r k r k k r r k k r r k r 0 can be used to extend res to the composed map 5 2 3 res k k k r r k k r r k r res kr the map res depends on the choice of coefficient field k r in r as follows let k r be another coefficient field in r and denote by res the above map with k r replaced by k r select transcendence bases yi k r and zi k r as field extensions of k and define the derivation t tk k by t t 1 and t zi 0 any k r r k can be expressed as 5 2 4 a dt t r i 1 bidyi a dt t r i 1 b idzi for a a bi b i k for the different choices of coefficient fields so that the relation between the residues becomes res a 1 a r i 1 bi t yi 1 res r i 1 res bi t yi dt remark 5

be the k vector space of logarithmic 1 forms let clk k be the closed 1 forms and put cl k k log k k log clk k let k be the algebraic closure of k in kr proposition 5 12 1 the map res in 5 2 3 restricts to a map k k log kr that is independent of the choice of coefficient field 2 the map res restricts to a map clk k k that is independent of the choice of coefficient field 3 res dk 0 4 res dlog remarks 5 13 1 saito proves 1 in the complex analytic situation where k k c kr is the field of meromorphic functions on a divisor d in a complex manifold and r is a ring of germs of meromorphic functions that do not have poles along d 81 16 it can also be denoted r k logmr 58 rolf ka llstro m 2 let d v f be an irreducible germ of a complex analytic hypersurface and be its discrete valuation if is a closed meromorphic 1 form with poles only along d we have res c where c is a generator of the cyclic homology group h 1 u d z for sufficiently small open sets u 3 by artin s approximation theorem there exists a finite field extension l k such that the algebraic closure k is isomorphic to the algebraic closure of k in l proof 1 consider the expressions 5 2 4 since k k log it follows that t r k so that a 0 and since td 2 r k implying bi 0 the assertion follows by remark 5 11 we can see also that res a a modmr where now a is evaluated without selecting a coefficient field not knowing that res arises also from res by a choice of k r one instead can check that a does not depend on the representation of suppose we have two decompositions a dt t 0 a dt t 0 where a a 0 and t 0 t 0 r k hence a a dt t 0 0 0 since td 2 r k 0 0 r k and therefore 0 0 r k it follows that a a 0 whence a a 2 select a coefficient field k r of r let t be a uniformising parameter and y 2 y 3 be a transcendence basis of kr k then the differentials dt dyi form a basis of k k k dyi and we let t i be the dual basis if adt r i 1 bidyi and d 0 we get r i 1 yi a t bi dyidt 0 and since the differentials dyidt k k 2 k k i 1 n are linearly independent over k yi a t bi 0 writing a i ait i bi j bijt j k k r t ai bij k r we get yi a 1 0 i 1 r hence by lemma 5 30 below a 1 belongs to the algebraic closure k of k in k r since the image of k under an isomorphism k r kr fixing k coincides with the algebraic closure k of k in kr it follows that res a 1 k kr 3 if k then dr k dr k r as elements in r k r equals and it is well known that res dr k r 0 4 if tmu where t 1 u 0 then dlog md t t d u u this implies the assertion saito s residue map is given by 5 2 5 res x logd kd r i 1 k odi

be the group of k divisors i e the abelian group of formal sums xx where the sum runs over points x of height 1 in a normal projective variety x x k and x is 0 except for finitely many points x selecting an embedding x pn the degree deg x is the degree of the closure of x in pn and one can define the degree map deg divk x k ht x 1 xx 7 ht x 1 x deg x let div 0 k x be the group of k divisors of degree 0 and clk 0 x the group k divisor classes modulo linear equivalence define the residue map resk cl k divk x 7 ht x 1 resx x one can argue that the following result is a generalization of the classical residue theorem for projective curves to higher dimensional projective varieties theorem 5 20 let x be a normal projective variety over a field of characteristic 0 and k be its fraction field the degree of the residue of a differential is 0 so we have a map resk cl k divk 0 x and a map resk i dk h 0 cdlog k clk 0 x remark 5 21 in 5 2 2 we have the map resx i x pic 0 x cl 0 x the integral weil divisors that are algebraically equivalent to a principal divisor we have inclusions i x i dk and cl 0 x cl 0 x clk 0 x the map resk in theorem 5 20 then extends resx d modules and finite maps 65 let us first sketch a way of proving theorem 5 20 by relying on the residue theorem for curves given a closed 1 form with polar locus d there exists an irreducible curve c that does not belong to d its restriction c is a 1 form on c that has residues along c d c which are related to the residues of along d by the intersection multiplicity between c and d the result can then be concluded from bezout s theorem and the fact that the sum of residues on a curve is 0 the detailed proof below is more uniform in that higher dimensional varieties are not treated differently from curves it follows the same general line of argument as hasse s proof for curves as presented in 82 11 where one starts with the projective line but here the treatment of higher dimensional projective spaces is more complicated for curves the hardest case is when k has postitive characteristic so one should really extend the above result also to positive characteristic but notice that we do not require that k be algebraically closed proof a we first prove the assertion when x pmk where the degree map deg divk p m k k is defined by linear extension from the usual degree deg v of a prime divisor v in pmk let be a closed differential form with poles along a hypersurface d ri 1 di in pmk where the di are irreducible and let h be a linear hypersurface in pmk that is not a component of d put resdi idi and set i i ni where ni k i k and k i is the algebraic closure of k in the fraction field of di let pi pmk h ox be irreducible polynomials that define di x 0 the differential i i dpi pi x clx h d and its residues along any divisor different from h is 0 we will prove that the residue of along h is 0 since x 0 p m k d h is affine by proposition 5 16 see 5 2 16 d where pmk clpm k log h and x 0 ox 0 since resw d 0 for any hypersurface w we get resh resh now since this is detailed below 5 3 1 pmk clpm k log h pmk cl pm k pmk pmk we get resh 0 and hence resh 0 so that degres r i 1 i deg res dpi pi r i 1 i deg pi 0 since the degree of a principal divisor is 0 it remains to see 5 3 1 select homogeneous coordinates t i such that h v t 0 put ti t i t 0 and si t i t j j 6 0 so that ti si s 0 i 6 j tj 1 s 0 and h t j 6 0 v s 0 put also a pmk h opmk k t 1 tm we have m i 1 aidti ajd 1 s 0 m i 1 i 6 j aid si s 0 1 s 20 aj m i 1 i 6 j siai ds 0 m i 1 i 6 j ai s 0 dsi where ai a on the

respect to the valuation h of h this implies that resh j s 20 1 0 here the residue is computed by expanding in k r where r h is the adic com pletion of the local ring r h of h s 0 is a uniformizing parameter and the si determine a coefficient field in r h a logarithmic differential whose residues are zero is regular 5 2 6 so that pmk clpm k the last equality in 5 3 1 follows from theorem 5 2 b

a projective variety also can be attached to a hodge class we shall see that this is possible at least when p 1 by lefschetz 1 1 theorem the cycle map cl x h 2 xa c h 2 x ox h 1 x x h 0 x 2 x composed with the projection to the middle term gives a surjective map to the integral hodge classes cl x h 2 xa z h 1 x 1 x 0 which also implies that we get a surjective map c clc x h 1 x 1 x 0 corollary 5 23 the degree map deg clc x c can be factorized as deg deg c where deg is a map deg h 1 x 1 x c proof it suffices to prove that if l r i 1 i di where di are prime divisors in x belongs to the kernel of

remark 5 32 proof 1 3 and 2 1 are evident 4 2 if dlog y l for some y k putting xl y we get dlog x it then suffices to prove 3 4 let yi k be a transcendence basis ofk and j derivations such that j yi

dq b q b db 0 so that db dq q b and writing jdyj j k we get bq b j j q b using the fact that q is the unique non zero monic monomial of minimal degree such that q b 0 a straightforward computation gives j qi qi i j whenever qi 6 0 there exists l such that ql 6 0 and then putting a ql we get l d log a dlogk alternative let l l k be a galois cover of l k let tr l l andn l k be the trace and norm maps respectively the trace extends to a map tr l k and tr dlog dlog n for l since dlog k we get l k tr dlog n dlogk thus if m is an e tale trivial dk module of rank 1 there exists an element in k and an integer l such that m dk 1 l and 1 l dlog the isomorphism classes of e tale trivial modules iet k can be identified with a subspace of clk dlogk and doing this we assert that iet k q z z dlog k 7 1 l dlog is a well defined map to see this if 1 dlog then 1 since 1 dlog 0 in q z z dlog k if 1 l dlog 1 l 1 dlog 1 then 1 l 1 dlog 1 1 ll 1 l dlog 1 1 ll 1 l 1 dlog 1 l dlog d modules and finite maps

in i et k the surjectivity should now also be clear it is straightforward to see also the remaining assertions let x be a normal projective model for k so that k is the fraction field of x one can determine whether m is e tale trivial from knowledge of the torsion subgroup cl t x of the divisor class group clt x cl 0 x cl x evidently and by theorem 5 25 if m is e tale trivial then x clx logd for some divisor d on x for a given x clx logd there is the following procedure to determine whether m iet k 1 check if l res has rational coefficients and if so one can find an integer l 1 such that l 1 l 1 l cl 0 x 2 determine if l 1 clt x 3 determine an integer l and a rational function k such that ll 1 ll 1 l then ll 1 dlog x x and since dlogk x x 0 we get m iet k if and only if ll 1 dlogk we can formulate this more succinctly define the map res iet k cltq x 7 res which is well defined since res dlog define also the map res 1 cl t q x iet k d 7 1 r dlog where rd for some r q and k this map is also well defined since if r 1 d 1 r 1 q k then res 1 r dlog 1 r 1 dlog 1 d d 0 hence there exists k such that 1 r dlog 1 r 1 dlog 1 dlog implying that 1 r dlog 1 r 1 dlog 1 it is straightforward to see that res and res 1 define homomorphisms of groups 70 rolf ka llstro m theorem 5 26 the residue map defines an isomorphism of groups res iet k cltq x whose inverse is given by res 1 proof if m

theorem and by the noether lefschetz theorem it also holds when x is a hypersurface in p 3 c of degree 4 having general moduli see 29 let us for example spell out what all this means when x pnk and k is its fraction field we assert that for any clk log with rational residues res clq p n k we havem i et k to see this let l 1 be an integer such that res l 1 cl 0 p n k 0 hence there exists a k such that res l 1 a now regarded as divisors in pnk since l 1 dlog a pnk pnk 0 we get thatm iet k sincek is the fraction field of a polynomial ring a which is a unique factorization domain we have a i p ni

selected to be the smallest integer such that n resx z for all points x of height 1 in pnk to answer 2 when clt x 6 0 one needs to look for a bound on the order of l 1 which is a problem that is not addressed here when x is a smooth curve such a method has been devised by risch 69 5 4 liouville s theorem one can ask when m clk becomes exponential after a field extension e k i e e km md dee for

is contained in liouville and ostrowski s classical theorem about elementary integrable func tions when k is the field of meromorphic functions in 1 variable over the complex numbers their proof is analytic rosenlicht 68 gave an algebraic proof of the univariate case in terms of differential algebra assuming k k and in 49 this univariate case was extended by allowing that the algebraic closure of k in k and e be different non regular extensions this was extended to several derivations in 48 using a similar method in the proof below the rather complicated study of partial fractions in 68 is replaced by a use of discrete valuations non regular elementary extensions are dealt with in a direct way and several derivations are allowed proof so assume 1 by induction over the length of the tower of elementary extensions in e k it suffices to prove that if k e k x is a simple extension of the types i iii and d i ci dlog i k i e ci k then actually k dlog k k dk this is the same strategy as in 68 but there it is assumed that k k in other words we need to prove that k dlog e de k k dlog k k dk whenever e k is a simple extension that is either finite exponential or logarithmic and we need only prove the non trivial assertion that if is an element of the left side then it is also a member of the right i e k is finite let e 1 kk be the composite of k and k in e so we have the tower e e 1 k we prove the assertion first for e 1 k and then e e 1 assume that i e 1 let vc be the finite dimensional vector space over q that is generated by the coefficients ci in then the ci can be expressed as linear combinations of elements in a basis of vc with coefficients in the rational numbers q and clearing denominators we see that in the right hand side of one can assume that the elements ci are linearly independent over q now by lemma 5 9 it follows that d k and by proposition 4 1 1 d e 1 k d k hence d d 1 for some 1 k since i e 1 kk this gives the assertion for e 1 k considering e e 1 let e e e 1 be a galois closure then since ci k e 1 e k tr d tr i tre e 1 ci dlog i d tre e 1 i ci dlog norme e 1 i hence k dloge 1 de 1 it follows that for the remaining cases we

nij 0 similarly if n 0 6 0 then 0 0 1 hence n 0 0 again the remaining case is lj 0 some i nij 0 all ij and n 0 0 that is we have 1 l 0 0 xl 0 j p lj j dlog u x xl 0 p lj j d 0 0 x l 0 d j p lj j k if d 0 6 0 there is a single monomial term of degree l 0 lj deg pj therefore lj 0 j 0 now assume d 0 0 so that 0 k lem 5 30 if l 0 1 then 0 1 l 0 1 0 so that 1 6 k hence 0 l 0 1 if l 0 0 and some lj 0 then since deg j p lj j deg d j p lj j this implies that 1 6 k hence lj 0 for all j finally if l 0 1 so that 1 d 0 xp where p j p lj j we claim that if p k x and d 0 xp k then p k since 0 is a

p k 5 5 representations of finite groups if y speck and m is an e tale trivial dy module then the horizontal sections m ty of the dual module forming the sheaf of solutions ofm is a locally constant e tale sheaf on y locally constant e tale sheaves are classified by representations of the absolute galois group of k and the representations in question will be the ones that act through a finite quotient of the absolute galois group this section contains a very down to earth description of this machinery to be used in the next section to give explicit forms in some cases of the decomposition theorem over differential rings on a variety x there is a general correspondence between representations of the differential galois group of a dk module m and the tensor category of modules generated by m defined using the existence of a picard vessiot extension l of k the picard vessiot theory in one variable is well presented in 76 including also a sketch of the several variables theory in its appendix d while referring to 62 for a more complete treatment there one starts with a d module and to get a representation of a group but we will conversely start with a finite subgroup g of the automorphisms group autk l of a field l that fixes a subfield k and a representation of g and end up in 74 rolf ka llstro m a dk module where k lg is the fixed subfield 19 let l be the algebraic closure of k in l the main assertion is that the category mod l g of modules over the group algebra of l g is equivalent to the category of dk modules that have trivial inverse image as dl module although this certainly is well known we lack precise and accessible references for our purposes so we include a complete proof which moreover is in keeping with the language of d modules we also do not assume k l compare theorem 5 28 or even that l is a subset of k so that l may not be central in l g a notable simplification is the use of lemma 5 30 to get that the functor s below is fully faithful put x specl y speck so that the map x y that is induced by the inclusion of fields k l is smooth we also have dx dl dy dk and the category of connections con x coincides with the category mod dl of dl modules m such that dimlm since l k is finite and separable we have dl l k dk and there exists a canonical inclusion dk dl the direct image functor modfd dl modfd dk is simply n n considered as dk module under the restriction to the subring dk dl and the inverse image functor modfd dk modfd dl is m l k m let modl dl be the category of dl modules that are isomorphic to a direct sum ln for some n and put modl dl g modl dl mod dl g let modl dk be the category of dk modules such that m modl dl define the functors s mod l g modlfd dl g v 7 l l v where g acts diagonally on l l v and dl acts only on first factor and s mod l fd dl g mod l g m 7 homdl l m mtl let d denote the poincare dual in a category of holonomic d modules and the ordinary dual in the category of finite dimensional g representations over k lemma 5 29 1 dl s s and s s dl 2 we have a triple of adjoint functors s s s 3 the functors s and s are fully faithful lemma 5 30 let c b be an inclusion of integral domains such that the exten sion of fraction fields k b k c is separable and finitely generated let tb c be the c linear derivations of b and c be the integral closure of c in b then c btb c b b b 0 tb c we remark that lemma 5 30 implies the central result 76 lemma 1 17 while the proof in loc cit is more complicated proof it is easy to see that c btb c so it suffices to prove that if b 6 c then there exists tb c such that b 6 0 there exist separable field extensions k c l k b where tr deg l k c 1 b l k c b and therefore tl k c b 6 0 the map tk b k c k b l tl k c is surjective since k b l is separable hence there exists an element 1 tk b k c such that 1 b 6 0 in k b multiplying by a suitable element c b we get c 1 tb c and b 6 0 19 non finite groups are of course also possible but we are here only interested in the finite ones d modules and finite maps 75 proof of lemma 5 29 1 this follows from lemma 2 11 2 it is evident that s s is an adjoint pair and 1 implies that s s is also an adjoint pair 3 s is fully faithful if m 1 m 2 modlfd dl g so that mi lni as dl module we have homdl g m 1 m 2 homl g m tl 1 m tl 2 homl g s m 1 s m 2 s is fully faithful for a l g module v s s v homdl l l l v homdl l l l v ltl k l v l l v v where the penultimate step follows from lemma 5 30 the picard vessiot equivalence for finite field extensions can now be deduced from the galois descent equivalence g g in proposition 3 4 the former is given by the functors g s mod k g modl dk and loc s g modfd dk mod k g theorem 5 31 the functor mod l g modfd dk is fully faithful and defines an equivalence of categories mod l g modlfd dk a quasi inverse of is given by the functor loc modlfd dk mod l g more over dk and loc loc dk remarks 5 32 1 if one restricts to abelian galois extensions l k then all the simples in modl dk are of rank 1 moreover if m is such a simple l trivial dk module there exists a radical extension l 1 k such that l 1 k m l 1 see proposition 5 24 2 it is easy to see that loc are functors between tensor categories one can notice however that the tannaka theorem is not invoked in the proof of theorem 5 31 proof of theorem 5 31 by proposition 3 4 and lemma 5 29 it follows that we have the adjoint pair of functors loc and also that we have loc s g g s s s id so that is fully faithful we also have again by proposition 3 4 and lemma 5 29 loc g s s g id theorem 5 31 implies that modlfd dk is a semisimple category by maschke s theorem this also follows from theorem 3 14 and similarly the following corollary to theorem 5 31 giving a decomposition of l also follows from corollary 3 28 in both cases one thus did not need to employ the equivalence corollary 5 33 l is semisimple more precisely l l g g l k k g l g g moreover homdk l l l g 76 rolf ka llstro m proof we have since k g k g as k g module l g g s l g l l k g g l k k g g homk g k l k k g homk g k l k k g homk g k g l l l where l is regarded as a dk module under the inclusion dk dl the last assertion follows since is fully faithful in theorem 5 31 we ended up in the category of l g modules where l g is not in general a group ring when l 6 k see also section 5 4 the situation is described by a diagram of field extensions l k 1 l k k where l is the algebraic closure of k in l and k 1 the composite of k and l in l since l k is galois it follows that all extensions in fact are galois let p denote the map speck 1 speck proposition 5 34 the functor p mod l dk modl dk 1 is fully faithful if m modl dk 1 is simple then p m n r where r l k 1 and k 1 is the algebraic closure of k in k on the group side we have the exact sequence 0 l g 1 l g l h 0 where g 1 and h are the galois groups of l k 1 and k 1 k respectively h is also the galois group of l k a similar argument as in the proof below implies that the restriction functor res mod l g mod l g 1 which corresponds to p also is fully faithful or apply theorem 5 31 proof 1 our categories are semisimple so it suffices to prove that an isomorphism p n 1 p n 2 gives an isomorphism n 1 n 2 when n 1 and n 2 are simple the map induces the homomorphism of dk modules below n 1 k 1 k n 2 l k n 2 n r 2 where r l k 1 since n 1 and n 2 are simple this implies the assertion 2 we have for any non zero element m m m dk 1 m l k dkm rdkm by 1 dkm is simple 5 6 the galois correspondence fix the fields k and l as above assume for simplicity that l k and consider a tower of intermediate fields k e 2 e 1 l corresponding in the usual galois correspondence to a tower of subgroups e h 1 h 2 g such that ei l hi we have now equivalences 1 loc 1 and 2 loc 2 mod k h 1 modlfd de 1 mod k h 2 modlfd de 2 d modules and finite maps 77 to the map p spece 1 spece 2 we have the adjoint triple p p p of functors th 2 15 mod l fd de 1 p p mod l fd de 2 that the direct image functor takes l trivial connections to l trivial connections is easily seen if one recalls that the direct image is simply by restriction to a subring de 2 de 1 we regard k h 2 as a k h 2 k h 1 bimodule the restriction functor res 21 mod k h 2 mod k h 1 v 7 homk h 2 k h 2 v v where the action on v is by the inclusion k h 1 k h 2 has a left adjoint which is the induction functor ind 12 mod k h 1 mod k h 2 v 7 k h 2 k h 1 v we have the duality functor mod k g mod k g v 7 v homk v k where the k g action is determined by g v v v g 1 v v v v v we use the same notation for the duality on mod k h when h is a subgroup of g since clearly res 21 res 21 the right adjoint is the coinduction coind 12 mod k h 1 mod k h 2 v 7 k h 2 k h 1 v homk h 1 k h 2 v where the k h 2 action is determined by h 2 r h 12 r when h 2 h 2 homk h 1 k h 2 v and r k h 2 we have a canonical homomorphism k h 2 k h 1 v k h 2 k h 1 v which is actually an isomorphism since the k h 2 k h 1 bimodule k h 2 is self dual hence coind 12 ind 12 since the two adjoints of res 21 are isomorphic we will only use the coinduction in the proposition below this is also reflected in the fact that p p th 2 15 proposition 5 35 the adjoint pairs p p and res 21 coind 12 correspond in the sense 1 loc 1 p 2 res 21 2 loc 2 p 1 coind 12 it follows also that p 1 res 21 loc 2 modl de 2 mod l de 1 p 2 coind 12 loc 1 modl de 1 mod l de 2 proof since we are dealing with two adjoint pairs and since we have equivalences of categories it suffices to prove 1 let si mod l dl hi mod k hi and gi mod l dl hi modl dei i 1 2 be the functors corresponding to s and g as described above so that loc 1 s 1 g 1 and 2 g 2 s 2 therefore by proposition 3 4 loc 1 p 2 s 1 g 1 p g 2 s 2 s 1 g 2 g 2 s 2 s 1 s 2 res 21 it is of some interest to connect with mackey s restriction theorem in group theory see 17 prop 22 using the above relation between the pairs inverse direct images and restriction induction and thereby showing that theorem 4 7 can be regarded as a generalization of mackey s theorem let h 1 and h 2 be subgroups of a finite group g and define h s sh 2 s 1 h 1 and s as before theorem 4 7 let v be a representation of h 2 and denote by vs the representation of h s 78 rolf ka llstro m that is formed by the composition h s h 2 gl v x 7 s 1 xs 7 s 1 xs mackey s restriction theorem states the following corollary 5 36 resh 1 ind g h 2 v s s indhh s vs proof the group g can be realized as a subgroup of gl v for som k vector space v so that it acts faithfully on the fraction field l k s v put k lg l 1 l h 1 and l

s s loch 1 ls lh s lh 2 h 2 v s s loch 1 ls h s vs s s ind h 1 h s vs and the last step again follows from proposition 5 35 5 7 inverse images of covering modules using the holomorphic notion higgs bundle it can be proven that if x y is a morphism of quasi projective algebraic complex manifolds then m is semisimple when m is a semisimple connection and if m is a second semisimple connection then m ox m is again a semisimple connection see 8 20 our argument for the weaker assertions below has the merit of being algebraic it would of course be interesting if one could extend the result to semisimple connections with any reductive differential galois group neither the category modcov dx nor con x are semisimple and although both categories are stable under taking tensor products the tensor product of simples in modcov dx need not remain semisimple in contrast the common subcategory concov x con x modcov dx of covering connections behaves better theorem 5 37 1 concov x is a semisimple category 2 let m 1 and m 2 be covering connections then m 1 ox m 2 is also a cov ering connection 3 if m 1 is a covering connection and m 2 is any semsimple connection then m 1 ox m 2 is a semisimple connection it follows that concov x forms a neutral tensor category where a fibre functor is given by m 7 homdl i i l k m i homdl i ni i kni for a galois field extension l k such that l km ni for some mutually non isomorphic dl modules i of rank 1 over l fixing the field extension l k and invertible and letting con cov x be the subcategory of modules m in concov x such that l km n for some integer n con cov x is equivalent with the neutral tensor category of semisimple finite dimensional representations of aut l k 20 the latter follows from the former by applying the former assertion to the diagonal mapping d modules and finite maps 79 proof let k ox denote the local ring at the generic point of x 1 let m be a covering connection and m be the dk module at the generic point there exists a finite field extension l k such that l km is diagonalizable so that in particular it is semisimple since there exists an injective homomorphism m l m lemma 3 25 implies that m is a semisimple and as m is a connection it equals the minimal extension of m hence m is semisimple 2 by 1 it suffices to prove that the connection m 1 ox m 2 is a covering module there exists a common finite field extension l k such that l k m 1 and l k m 2 are diagonalizable now there exists a canonical injective homo morphism of dk modules l m 1 k m 2 l k m 1 l l k m 1 since the tensor product of modules of generic rank 1 again is a module of generic rank 1 it follows that the above module is diagonalizable 3 let l k be a finite field extension such that l k m 1 diagonlizable we have l k m 1 k m 2 l k m 1 l l k m 2 since l k m 2 is semisimple by theorem 3 14 l k m 1 is diagonlizable and the tensor product of a rank 1 module and a simple module is again simple it follows that the above module is semisimple hence by theorem 3 21 it is also simple as dk module and we denote it as such by 0 l k m 1 k m 2 letting j speck x be the inclusion of the generic point we have m 1 ox m 2 j 0 l k m 2 n where on the right we have the minimal extension module which is semisimple this implies the assertion remark 5 38 another proof of theorem 5 37 3 follows by takingm 1 km 2 on x kx pulling back by the diagonal mapx x kx and applying theorem 5 39 below theorem 5 39 let x y be a morphism of smooth varieties and m concov y then m concov y and in particular m is semisimple example 5 40 letm da 2 f where f y x 2 k x y this is a simple da 2 module and we give two morphisms such that its inverse image is not semisimple 1 if y 0 a 2 k is the inclusion of the x axis then m k x 1 x 2 if x spec k x z a 2 k x z 7 x z 2 x 2 is the integral closure of a 2 k in the field extension k x y f k x y then m k x z 1 z proof since m con x it suffices by theorem 5 37 1 to prove that m is a covering module one can factor into a closed embedding and a projection so it suffices to prove the assertion separately when is one of these types when is a projection this is a consequence of theorem 3 14 so what remains is the case when is a closed embedding moreover a closed embedding can be factorized into closed embeddings x y such that x is a smooth hypersurface in y the proof therefore follows if we prove that m is a covering module when is an embedding of a smooth hypersurface by assumption there exists a morphism of varieties p y y such that p m is diagonalizable where y is the integral closure of y in som field extension of the fraction field of y let y y be a desingularization of y and p y y y be the composed map then p m is a connection whose generic stalk is diagonalizable hence it equals a direct sum i of connections i of rank 1 let p 1 x x be the base change of y y over x y and j x y be the 80 rolf ka llstro m projection on the second factor then j is a closed embedding and j x is a divisor in y since p 1 p j we get p 1 m j p m j i j i therefore m is a covering module 6 simply connected varieties simply connected varieties are approached algebraically by studying categories of connections instead of fundamental groups 6 1 generalities let x k be a smooth quasi projective variety over an alge braically closed field k of characteristic 0 and conet x conrs x con x be the categories of e tale trivial regular singular and all connections on x re spectively the left inclusion is immediate when x is a quasi projective curve and the general case follows from this using curve regularity as definition of regular singularities 15 all three categories form k linear rigid neutral abelian tensor cat egories and are therefore equivalent to representation categories of certain affine tannaka group schemes with maps alg 1 x p rs 1 x p et 1 x p where p is a choice of geometric point in x the first map is surjective and et 1 x p is the pro finite completion both of the first and second terms here conet x is equivalent to the category of finite dimensional representations of the e tale funda mental group et 1 x p con x is equivalent to the category of finite dimensional representations of the algebraic fundamental group alg 1 x p and conrs x is equivalent to the category of finite dimensional representations of rs 1 x p we will simply write 1 x p rs 1 x p notice that if x is proper then con x conrs x so that alg 1 x p 1 x p see 25 for a more detailed discussion when k c we have conrs x conrs xa con xa for a quasi projective manifold x where xa is its associated complex analytic manifold and 1 x p is isomorphic to the topological fundamental group top 1 xa a 15 say x is e tale simply connected abbr e s c if any object m in conet x is trivial i e m onx for some integer n similarly x is simply connected s c if any object in conrs x is trivial 21 now we have x is s c x is e s c where the arrow to the right is evident while the opposite direction follows from the grothendieck malcev theorem 64 65 whose proof is based on the fact that top 1 xa a is finitely generated we will below only use the trivial implication but it would nevertheless be great to see an algebraic proof that e s c implies s c remarks 6 1 1 let x k be a smooth quasi projective over a subfield k c so that k l c where l is the algebraic closure of k in the field of complex numbers c let xl be the base change of x over l k and xa be its complex analytification we have natural functors conrs x conrs xl conrs xc conrs xa where the equivalence follows from g a g a now it can happen that top 1 xa p 6 0 or et 1 x p 6 0 while x is simply connected in our sense 21 one can also ask that con x only contain trivial objects when x quasi projective but if x x d for a smooth projective variety x of dimension 1 and d a divisor such that x is affine then con x will contain non trivial objects of rank 1 exponential modules see 5 2 2 d modules and finite maps 81 one cause for this is that top 1 xa p need not be residually finite 89 even when x is projective another that k 6 l so that even if top 1 xa p is residually finite not all its representation need come from conrs x we also have mod l et 1 x conet x conet xk mod l et 1 xk see proposition 5 34 for example let pnk be the projective space over the field k where n 1 then top 1 pnr p is non trivial while pnr is simply con nected all non trivial real analytic connections on pnr are non algebraic we also have et 1 p n c p 1 et 1 pnr p c 2 and conet pnr mod c c 2 mod r in accordance with proposition 6 4 below 2 simple e tale trivial connectionsm are submodules of monomial modules i e there exists an e tale map x x such that m ox th 7 20 3 if there exists an e tale map p x x where x is e s c then conet x is generated by the simples in p ox the e tale fundamental group is finite if and only if conet x contains finitely many isomorphism classes of simples 4 on a smooth variety x the inclusion conet x con x is in general strict also when x is projective for example by lemma 5 6 i x x x pic 0 x and i et x pic 0 x this follows since although global 1 forms on a projective variety are closed they do not belong to dlog l nor d l for any finite field extension l of the fraction field of x for instance if x is a smooth projective curve of genus g 1 then conet x 6 con x a connection on a smooth variety is determined by its local structure in the following strong sense if m 1 and m 2 are connections that are isomorphic at the generic point of x then m 1 m 2 prop 9 13 we have also the following useful remarks remarks 6 2 1 a simple connection m is trivial if and only if there ex ists generators i of tk as lie algebroid such that the invariant space i k ox m i 6 0 2 let u be an open dense subset of x and j u x be the open inclusion if u is e s c s c then x is e s c s c put z x u and assume that codimx z 2 ifm con u it follows that j m con x therefore x is e s c s c if and only if u is e s c s c this plays the counterpart of the zariski nagata purity theorem for finite maps now allow x k to be a singular variety reduced with singular locus s and j xreg x s x be the inclusion of its regular locus then we have the restriction functor j con x con xreg which clearly is fully faithful if x is normal andm con xreg then n j m is a connection by grothendieck s finiteness theorem 30 prop 3 2 such that depths n 2 and in fact we have an equivalence between con xreg and the subcategory con 2 x of objects n in con x such that depths n 2 consider also the subcategory conf x con 2 x con x of locally free connections on x and say that x is s c when any object in conf x is isomorphic to omx for some integer m in the complex analytic case the category of finite dimensional representations of top 1 xa p is equivalent to con f xa no tice that if s 6 then con xa always contains non trivial objects for example 82 rolf ka llstro m the jacobian ideal is preserved by tx finally if xreg is s c it follows that any object in conf x is of the form omx so that x is also s c remark 6 3 in 77 kawamata log terminal singularities are allowed on x they prove that there exists a finite map x x e tale over points if height 1 such that con x reg conf x it seems to be well known that 1 xreg p is trivial when x k is a normal rational projective variety and k is an algebraically closed field see 32 xi cor 1 2 and discussion in 52 for a proof that et 1 p n k p is trivial when k is algebraically closed of characteristic 0 see 32 exp xi and the discussion in 51 but to get that et 1 a n k p is trivial by algebraic means is not entirely straightforward when n 1 granting the equivalence between conet xreg conrs xreg and the category of finite dimensional representations of et 1 xreg p 1 xreg p these results can be concluded by instead showing that xreg is e s c s c 22 which we achieve below by using the well known fact that the tangent sheaf of pnk is generated by its global sections and that pnk tpnk sln k proposition 6 4 1 the affine space ank and projective space p n k are both simply connected 2 the smooth locus xreg of a normal projective rational variety x is simply connected and therefore x itself is simply connected proof 1 we need the well known fact that the algebraic de rham cohomology of affine space is concentrated in degree 0 in particular ext 1 an k k x k x h 1 dr a n k 0 where k x k x 1 xn is a polynomial ring and an k is its weyl algebra by it suffices to prove that if m is simple regular singular dpn k module whose restriction man k to an affine subset ank is a non zero connection then mank k x for this it suffices to prove that the restriction mk of m to the generic point is isomorphic to k and for this in turn it suffices see remark 6 2 1 to prove that the space of global sections v ank mank contains a non zero constant vector i e v xi 6 0 let x i be homogeneous coordinates of pnk and put xi x i x 0 the space v forms a representation of sln k p n k tpnk and is moreover a finite module over a k x 1 xn ank opnk put x 0 x 0 n i 1 xi i sln k since m has regular sin gularities v is locally finite over the polynomial ring r k so that if v is a vector in v then dimk r v it follows that there exists a finite dimensional r submodule v 0 such that av 0 v the support suppv 0 specr is a finite set 1 r where i are prime ideals since suppa n specr we have suppv suppav 0 i i n if m is an integer the prime ideal m is a translate of therefore there exists an integer i such that i 1 6 suppv since supp iv 0 suppv it follows that i v 0 if suppr v i therefore vi v i 6 0 now vi is a finitely generated module over ai k x 1 xi 1 xi 1 xn and since i j 0 it is also a representation of sln 1 k p n 1 k tpn 1 k which again is locally finite over one can therefore iterate and conclude that ni 1 v i 6 0 22 to get that 1 xreg p is trivial from the triviality conrs xreg one also needs to know that 1 xreg p is residually finite d modules and finite maps 83 2 let firstm be a connection on a smooth rational projective variety x if k and kx are the fraction fields of p n k and kx respectively there exists a birational morphism u ux where u is a subset of pnk and ux an open subset of x such that codimpn k pnk u 2 and inducing an isomorphism k kx the inverse image mpn k therefore defines a connection on pnk so that by 1 mpnk ompn k for some integer m therefore at the generic points we have isomorphisms of dk modules kx ox m k opn k ompn k km kmx hence m omx now assume that x is a normal rational projective variety over k j xreg x be the inclusion of its smooth locus and m be a connection xreg since x is normal it follows that n j m con 2 x there exists a desingularization x x that is an isomorphism over xreg again since x is normal it satisfies serre s condition s 2 hence j j tx tx so that we get a well defined tangent map tx tx therefore there exists a well defined inverse image n forming a connection on the smooth rational variety x hence it is locally free over ox but by the previous paragraph we even have n omx for some integer m hence its restriction to the generic point kx ox n kmx so that m j n omxreg this implies that xreg is s c remark 6 5 using another well known fact that connections onpnk are generated by their global sections 15 vii prop 9 1 proposition 5 3 also implies that pnk is simply connected proposition 6 6 let x y be a smooth proper map of smooth connected varieties with connected fibres the following are equivalent 1 x is simply connected 2 y is simply connected and a closed fibre of is simply connected proof 1 2 let n be a connection on y of rank n it follows that n is a trivial connection on x since is proper with connected fibres it follows that n n onx ony therefore y is simply connected 2 1 if m is a connection on x then m is a trivial connection on y prop 5 4 and m is a trivial connection on x the canonical map m m is a morphism of locally free ox modules which we assert is an isomorphism let j f x be the inclusion of a fibre over a point in y which is an embedding of a smooth proper variety since is smooth and proper it suffices to see that induces an isomorphism j m j m where by assumption both sides are trivial connections now conclude from the base change teorem 15 vi 8 th 8 4 6 2 the grothendieck lefschetz theorem for connections we will make some remarks pertaining to the grothendieck lefschetz theorem about the e tale fundamental group as expounded in 30 and 33 ch 4 2 but here instead of studying e tale covers our objective is to compare the category con x conet x to con y conet y where y is a smooth subvariety of a smooth projective variety x over a field k of characteristic 0 and we can work with either con x or conet x while loc cit only considers the latter category but see remark 6 15 the central idea to factorize over a completion is due to grothendieck and the 84 rolf ka llstro m contribution by hartshorne by simplifying the treatment of an important special case is much acknowledged so we are given a closed embedding y x pnk and put n dimx and r codimx y the main question is to determine when the restriction functor 6 2 1 con et x con et y is fully faithful and even an equivalence 23 below we will only consider con x since conet x is treated in the same way to attain our objective we follow the track of grothendieck by factoring over the formal completion x of x along y using the maps y x x so that and where we have the usual inverse image functors con x con x con y to emphasise con x is the category of d x modules that are coherent over o x putting e hry ox ox define the functor con y con x n homox n e proposition 6 7 the functors form mutually inverse equivalences of cat egories con y con x we make some preparations before the proof by extending to a non local sit uation some results related to matlis duality put for an o x module m m homo x m e lemma 6 8 1 if n is a coherent oy module then n n so that if n is locally free then n n 2 e o x 3 if m is a coherent o x module then m m so that in particular if m is also locally free then m m put mn m iny m m inym 0 homox o x iny m remark 6 9 it follows from the proof that if m m i n y for some high n and if either mn mn 1 or inm in 1 m are locally free over oy then m m proof 1 let here denote the derived inverse image so that if w is a d x module with support in y then w w iy r a single degree complex con centrated in the degree r and if w is torsion free then w w iyw a single degree complex concentrated in the degree 0 we recall kashiwara s equivalence that for a holonomic dy module n n r n this gives homo x n e homo x n o x iy homo x n oy r homo x n oy n 23 of course according to kashiwara s theorem con y is equivalent to the subcategory of holonomic dx modules m such that suppm y and m is a connection d modules and finite maps 85 2 since e lim nen we get where the fourth equality is detailed below homo x e e homo x lim n en e lim n homo x en e lim n homo x homo x o x iny e e lim n o x iny o x we need to prove the assertion o x iny o x iny to see this we first include an aside a letm andn be coherento x modules such that suppn y and the homology of the complex r y m is concentrated in the degree r then the homology of rhomo x n r y m is also concentrated in the degree r to see this first note that the assumption implies that the homology ofrhomo x n m is concentrated in the degree r next applying rhomo x n to the distin guished triangle r y m m rj j m one getsrhomo x n r y m rhomo x n m implying a therefore by a y being a local complete intersec tion of codimension r the homology of rhomo x n r y ox is concentrated in the degree r in particular ext 1 o x n e 0 applying twice to the exact sequences 0 i n y in 1 y o x in 1 y o x iny 0 we therefore get the exact sequences 0 i n y in 1 y o x in 1 y o x iny 0 so the assertion follows by induction and 1 since we have a canonical map from to and the modules iny i n 1 y are locally free over oy 3 it follows by 2 that m e o x m m then evidently if m m it follows that m m proof of proposition 6 7 let m con x and n con y we have m m iym and locally n is isomorphic to en where n rankn so that by lemma 6 8 homo x n e is locally isomorphic to on x thus n homo x n e homoy n oy n since m is locally isomorphic to om x m rankm so that m is locally isomorphic to omy we get as before that m is locally isomorphic to em therefore again by lemma 6 8 m homo x m e m we recall the reformulation of the condition that and be fully faithful or an equivalence by grothendieck say that satisfies the lefschetz condition lef x y if for locally free ox modules m we have x m x m say also that satisfies leff x y if lef x y holds and moreover for any locally free o x module n there exists a locally free ox module m such that n m similarly satisfies lefc x y and leffc x y respectively if the above condi tions are satisfied when is replaced by and m and n are connections 86 rolf ka llstro m remark 6 10 we do not need to consider open neighbourhoods of y in x so that our effective lefschetz condition leff x y is stronger than the one used in 30 exp x 2 and 33 ch 4 1 lemma 6 11 1 is fully faithful if and only if lef x y lefc x y holds 2 is an equivalence if and only if leff x y leff c x y holds proof we consider only and note that one implication is evident 1 if m 1 m 2 con x then n homox n 1 n 2 con x so by lefc x y homdx m 1 m 2 x n x n homdx m 1 m 2 2 evident let j u x y x be the open inclusion the coherent cohomological di mension for u cd u satisfies cd u r if the homology of the complex r u mu is non zero only in degrees 0 r when mu is a coherent ou modules similarly we have the flat coherent cohomological dimension cdc u if we also require that mu be a connection in general we have cdc u cd u where strict inequality holds for instance when u is simply connected and max i hi u ou 6 0 cd u proposition 6 12 1 if cd u n 1 then lef x y holds 2 if cdc u n 1 then lefc x y holds and is fully faithful we remark right away that cd u n 1 if y is a complete intersection y x h 1 h 2 hr r n where the hi are hypersurfaces in pnk since then u is a union of at most n 1 affine sets see 33 cor 1 2 proof for 1 see 33 ch 4 prop 1 1 one gets the assertion about in 2 in a similar way to see that is fully faithful it is convenient to instead prove that is fully faithful where the inverse image functor for right connections right d modules is n n y oy x ox n this implies also that is fully faithful since the pair x ox y oy defines equivalences between the categories of left and right connections on x and y respectively first as in the proof of 1 if m is a connection and since cdc u n 1 hn r x r y m h n x m h 0 x m ox x where now n m ox x is a right connection by kashiwara s theorem defines an equivalence between quasi coherent dy modules and quasi coherent dx modules whose support belongs to y and r y m m r see 35 th 1 6 1 moreover a dx module whose support belongs to y is quasi isomorphic to a complex of quasi coherent flasque sheaves of dx modules with support in y this implies hn r x r y m h n r x m hn r y m h 0 y y oy m where the last step follows from serre duality since n y oy m y oy m we get h 0 x n h 0 y n so that similarly to lemma 6 11 one concludes that is fully faithful the grothendieck lefschetz theorem for connections takes the following form theorem 6 13 let y be a smooth subvariety of a smooth projective variety x 1 if y is a complete intersection then is fully faithful 2 if 1 holds and moreover dimy 2 then is an equivalence of categories d modules and finite maps 87 proof it remains to see when is an equivalence let ox 1 be an ample line bundle on x o x 1 ox 1 and for an ox module m put m m o x m o x m since y is a set theoretic complete intersection it follows that cd u n 1 see 33 so that is fully faithful if m con x then m m is generated by its global sections and therefore m m is also generated by its global sections for m 0 to get the converse assume the following condition g the category of locally freeo x modules is generated by the invertible sheaves o x m m z the point is that o x m ox m it follows that there exists an exact sequence of locally free o x modules f 1 h f 0 m such that f 1 f 1 and f 0 f 0 for some locally free ox modules f 0 f 1 since is fully faithful we have x homox f 1 f 0 x homox f 1 f 0 x homox f 1 f 0 so that there exists an extension h f 1 f 0 of h such that putting m coker h then m m this argument is well known see 33 th 1 5 it remains to see that m is a connection which again follows since is fully faithful a connection is determined by a map homox m p 1 x m homox m p 1 x m homox m p 1 x m where p 1 x m is the sheaf of first order principal parts see 31 16 therefore the connection on m determines uniquely a connection on m considering the curvature map x m 2 x m one proves similarly that this map is 0 so the connection on m is integrable in general g need not hold see 33 contrary to the corresponding statement for x by serre s theorem but if dimy 2 then g holds which is the content of the following lemma forming a main step in the proof of grothendieck s theorem in 33 ch 4 2 lemma 6 14 30 exp ix th 2 2 33 prop 1 3 assume that is fully faithful lef x y and that dimy 2 if m is a locally free o x module then the space of global sections x m m generates m m when m 0 in particuar g holds remark 6 15 when xa is a projective complex analytic manifold the assertion in theorem 6 13 follows from the lefschetz theorem about the isomorphism between 1 ya p and 1 xa p 3 10 combined with g a g a and the riemann hilbert equivalence regarding proposition 6 7 we know that the category of e tale cover ings of y and x are equivalent 32 8 4 6 3 differential coverings a tool is introduced to analyze con x by cutting out points by subvarieties let c be a family of subvarieties of x with defining ideals i and for a point x in x let x be the subset of in such that x belongs to c let tx i tx be the subsheaf of derivations that are preserve the ideal i so that i i i e is tangential to c lemma 6 16 the following are equivalent for a smooth point x in x 1 tx x x tx x i 88 rolf ka llstro m 2 the map of tangent vector spaces x kc x oc x tc x kx x ox x tx x is surjective if moreover x is a smooth point in the varieties c then 1 2 are equivalent to the map mx x m 2 x x x mc x m 2 c x being injective proof assume 1 since x is a smooth point so that tx x is free then kx x ox x tx x is isomorphic to the tangent spacehomkx x mx x m 2 x x kx x the map tx x i kc x oc xtc x is surjective and we have a well defined tangent map kc x oc x tc x kc x ox x tx x these remarks imply 2 the last assertion follows since tc x is free if the condition 1 in lemma 6 16 is satisfied we say that c cuts out the point x let p c x be the normalization map of c x it is important to realize that in general the sheaf of derivations from ox to oc tc x does not equal p tx when c s 6 s is the singular locus of x and therefore there exist no tangent mapping from t c to p tx so that even if m is a connection p m need not be a connection therefore instead of asking not only that c be s c we say that p is simply connected if c is s c and p m indeed is a connection for any m conf x definition 6 17 a differential covering of a variety x is a family of subvarieties c that cut out the points in a dense subset of x say that x is differentially simple d s if x can be a provided with a differential covering such that the normalization maps p are simply connected proposition 6 18 assume that x is a normal variety that is provided with a differential covering c that cut out the points in an open subset x 0 such that codimx x x 0 2 let m be a coherent ox submodule of a connection n such that the inverse image p m is a connection then j j m is a subconnection of j j n where j x 0 x is the open inclusion of course if x is smooth then j j n n proof since n is a connection and x is normal so that j j ox ox it suffices to prove that tx 0 mx 0 mx 0 if x tx x and x x 0 by lemma 6 16 x defines a map x mx kx x ox x mx hence by nakayama s lemma the ox 0 submodule tx 0 mx 0 nx 0 maps to 0 in nx 0 mx 0 and therefore tx 0 mx 0 mx 0 theorem 6 19 differentially simple varieties are simply connected the proof is postponed corollary 6 20 if x and y are e tale simply connected normal varieties then x k y is also e tale simply connected when one of the factors is proper this follows from 32 cor 1 7 and also from proposition 6 6 it needs not hold in positive characteristic when one of the factors is non proper loc cit rem 1 10 d modules and finite maps 89 proof the maps py x y x y and px x y x y x xreg y yreg form differential covering of x y where each px and py is simply connected now conclude from theorem 6 19 one says that a projective variety x is rationally connected if any pair of points in x belongs to p p 1 k for some map p p 1 k x in some senses the category of rationally connected varieties is more natural than its subcategory of rational vari eties as proposed in 60 and expounded in 5 61 we want to apply theorem 6 19 to such x but relax the condition that x be projective compensating by instead using maps from the affine line p a 1 k x let j x x and i a 1 k p 1 k be a smooth completion of x and a 1 k respectively identifying x and a 1 k with open subsets in x and p 1 k an equivalent definition for x being rationally connected is that there exists a variety m and an evaluation map e p 1 k m x such that the naturally induced map c p 1 p 1 m x x is dominant see 61 def 3 2 5 def 4 3 let m 0 be the projection of e 1 x a 1 k m on the second factor of p 1 k m so that we get a map e 0 a 1 k m 0 x if any two points in a non empty open subset of x belong to a common affine line p a 1 k the restriction of c c 0 a 1 k a 1 k m 0 x x is again dominant say that a quasi projective variety x is rationally connected if there exists a variety m 0 and a map e 0 a 1 k m 0 x such that the induced map c 0 a 1 k a 1 k m 0 x x is dominant if x is rationally connected c 0 is dominant then x is rationally connected in the sense of 5 def 4 3 c is dominant but the converse does not hold corollary 6 21 let x be a smooth quasi projective rationally connected variety of characteristic 0 then x is differentially simple and is therefore simply connected remark 6 22 a proof that 1 x p is trivial when x is a complex smooth pro jective rationally chain connected variety is presented in 5 cor 4 18 where the idea to use hodge theory was employed already by serre 16 to prove that unirational projective complex manifolds are simply connected the application of hodge theory requires that x be projective and only implies that conet x is trivial to get that con x is trivial one also needs that 1 xa is finite see 5 cor 4 18 using an idea from 21 24 in corollary 6 21 it is not required that x be projective and its proof is algebraic proof since c 0 is dominant by generic smoothness there exists an open subset x x 0 over which c 0 is smooth the image x 0 of x x 0 with respect to the projection p 2 x x x on the second factor is an open subset of x for x x 0 put x 0 x p 1 2 x x x 0 which we identify with an open subset of x the base change of c 0 over the inclusion x 0 x x x 0 x x defines a smooth map e 0 x a 1 k m 0 x x 0 x again by generic smoothness there exists a non empty open subset x 00 x x 0 x x over which e 0 x is smooth let e 00 x a 1 k m 00 x x 00 x be the base change which is thus a smooth map for each f m 00 x denote also by f a 1 k x 00 x the restriction of e 00 x to a 1 k f now there exists an open subset x 00 x 0 of points x such that the tangent mapping of f a 1 k x is injective at points in a 1 k above f x assume from the beginning that x x 00 since the condition that the tangent map of f is injective above points of x is open in mx there exists a non empty open subset m s 00 x of m 00 x such that the restriction es 00 x a 1 k m s 00 x x 00 x 24 one can instead invoke the grothendieck malcev theorem 90 rolf ka llstro m is smooth and if f m s 00 x then the tangent map of f is injective at points in a 1 k above f x this implies that the curves f a 1 k f m s 00 x cut out the point x therefore the set of maps f a 1 k x cut out an open subset of x hence by theorem 6 19 and proposition 6 4 x is simply connected question 6 23 assume that x is a smooth quasi projective complex variety that is provided with a differential covering by rational curves is then x rationally connected being differentially simple is a birational property in a rather stronge sense lemma 6 24 let x y be a dominant morphism of quasi projective vari eties 1 if x is normal and d s and y is smooth then y is d s 2 asume that is proper x is smooth and y is normal if y can be provided with a differential covering such that the smooth locus c reg is s c then x is d s often the coverings p c y are such that c is smooth e g c is a curve so that the auxilliary condition in 2 is satisfied proof 1 by generic smoothness char k 0 a differential covering p c x gives one on y p p c y since y is smooth it follows that if p is simply connected then so is p 2 since is proper and c is normal p c y lifts to maps of schemes p c 1 x where c 1 is a subscheme of c such that codimc c c 1 2 again by generic smoothness the maps p cut out a dense subset of x if m is a connection on x then since x is smooth p m is a connection on c 1 since c reg c 1 and c reg is s c it follows that p m is trivial we can go further than lemma 6 24 1 corollary 6 25 assume that x y is a dominant morphism of normal varieties and let sy be the singular locus of y if x is d s e g x ank and codimx 1 sy 2 then y is d s and hence simply connected corollary 6 25 generalizes by not requiring properness results of similar nature in 56 58 proof since codimx 1 s 2 it follows that if m is a connection then m is a connection on x since x is d s it follows that x is s c th 6 19 so that m is a trivial connection if p c x is a differential covering such that p is simply connected then p y is a differential covering and p m p m is a trivial connection on c this implies that y is d s and hence simply connected proof of theorem 6 19 recall that a connection m is trivial if it is trival at the generic points of x and c is a differential covering if and only if it is a differential covering of each component of x therefore it is sufficient to prove the assertion when x contains only one generic point there exists then an integer m and a non empty open subset u of xreg such that mu omu as ou module and the connection is determined by defining a map d omu u omu where d is the trivial connection on omu and is section of u endou omu d modules and finite maps 91 u ou endou omu 25 then m is trivial if and only if belongs to the image of the map dlog autox omx u x endox omx u 7 1 d where d endou omu and tx u here autox omx u denotes an ou linear automorphism of omu put x end omx u x end omx u tx i u i end omx u the inverse image p m has the connection omc c o m c where d the connection matrix is given by as a m a m where a oc m o m c tc and a lift tx i of exists since u is smooth since p m is trivial there exists aut omc such that dlog there exists aut omu that restricts to it follows that dlog where x end omx u hence dlogautox m u x endox m u for any in there is the exact sequence of sheaves on u 0 dlog autou omx dlog autou omu c u endou o m u c x endou omu dlogautou omu where the image im c x endou omu dlogautou omu since c is a differential covering there exists a dense subset x 0 of x such that if x is a point in x 0 then tx x x tx x i thus if is a section of tx that is defined at a point x x 0 u then x x x where x tx x i applying x to im x we get x c x x endou omu x dlogautou omu x x x x c x x endou omu x x dlogautou omu x x x i endou omu x dlogautou omu x x mx endou o m u x dlogautou omu x x 25 the endomorphism also satisfies an integrability condition but this will not play any role below besides the fact that its restrictions to the varieties c do gives rise to integrable connections 92 rolf ka llstro m since x 0 u u is dense and x end omx is coherent and torsion free we get that dlogautou omu x x 0 u mx x end omx dlogautou omu this completes the proof that m is trivial 7 the decomposition of ox perhaps the most central problem is to decompose the monomial dy module n ox oy t for a finite surjective map of smooth varieties x y although such a decomposition is determined already at the generic point of y eeping track of the ramification of is important for actually constructing submodules of n still explicit generators of the simple constituents of t are hard to get which is one reason for studying a certain canonical filtration ni of n the idea is to use a natural stratification xij yi of so that the submodule ni n is defined by requiring the vanishing of local cohomology along the stratum yi for this purpose totally ramified maps are important where the residue field extension at the generic point of the deepest stata of the ramification locus b is trivial since then it turns out that the vanishing trace module t has vanishing local cohomology along the deepest stratum in yi th 7 4 using this observation we reach the main result of this section th 7 30 namely that generators of ni are determined by vanishing trace conditions over morphisms x zij that are totally ramified along xij and fitting in a factorisations x zij y so that zij y is e tale over yj the existence of such factorizations may be of independent interest th 7 17 the galois situation is of course interesting so that y xg for a finite group g and is the invariant map the problem of finding generators of the simple constituents appearing in theorem 3 27 corresponds to a branching problem for representations of groups but the goal here is to geometrically construct the simples without relying on group theory to eventually understand also non galois maps this problem was resolved in 14 when g is the generalized symmetric group acting an a finite dimensional vector space v and x spec s v where young or specht polynomials form generators of the simples of n and these polynomials are naturally constructed from the canonical stratification of in section 8 this will be taken a step further 7 1 total ramification let x y be a morphism of smooth varieties f be a closed subset of y and put xf 1 f so we have the diagram 7 1 1 xf i p x f i y the following base change property for local cohomology is surely well known 26 theorem 7 1 independence of base r xf r f as functors on the category of quasi coherent dx modules 26 theorem 7 1 is stated without proof in 12 th 2 5 28 d modules and finite maps 93 proof let j y f x and j x xf x be the open inclusions since supp r xf f so that j r xf 0 applying the distinguished triangle r f id j j 1 to the functor r xf gives r f r xf r xf this implies after applying r f to the distinguished triangle r xf id j j 1 that one gets the triangle r xf r f r f j j 1 finally for the last vertex we have since j j 0 r f j j r f j 0 j 0 where in the last step we use r f j 0 this completes the proof it is basic to our characterization of the canonical filtration of ox to be studied below that the kernel of the trace morphism behaves well with respect to base change let m be a coherent dy module and define t m by the distin guished triangle t m m tr m 1 assuming p xf f is a morphism of smooth varieties we also have the triangle tp i m p p i m i m 1 definition 7 2 let x be a point of x and put y x and let f be a closed subset of y then is totally ramified 1 at x if ky x kx x 2 at y if 1 y x and is totally ramified at x 3 along a closed set f in y if in the diagram 7 1 1 p is an isomorphism say also that is totally ramified if d 6 and it is totally ramified along each deepest stratum of the discriminant locus d remark 7 3 if the closure x of x is normal by lemma 7 15 2 below the following are equivalent 1 is totally ramified at x 2 is totally ramified along x clearly if is totally ramified along f then it is totally ramified along each closed subset of f in particular is totally ramified along the deepest smooth strata of f theorem 7 4 keep the notation in theorem 7 1 and assume that f and xf are smooth 1 i t m tp i m 2 if is totally ramified along f then r f t m 0 proof by kashiwara s theorem i i m r f m and i i m r xf m therefore by theorem 7 1 i i m r f m r xf m i i m i p p i m therefore gives the distinguished triangle i i t m i p p i m i i m 1 94 rolf ka llstro m by kashiwara s theorem we can erase i i t m p p i m i m 1 where now is the trace morphism p p i m i m if p is an isomorphism it follows that i t m 0 and hence r f t m 0 example 7 5 let a b be a finite totally ramified morphism of smooth k algebras i e ka kb and put t ker tr b a by theorem 7 4 it follows that r ma t 0 one can consider the maximal connection nc in any holonomic dx module n and define the coherent direct image functor c coh dx con y n 7 c n n c when m is a connection and is e tale then c m m but in general it can be difficult to determine c m when is ramified in the totally ramified case on the other hand we have theorem 7 6 let be a finite totally ramified morphism of smooth varieties 1 if m is a holonomic module such that m is semisimple see theo rem 3 14 then c m mc 2 the functor con y con x is fully faithful so that if m is connection on y then c m m the functor c is certainly not faithful for example if the extension of fraction fields k x k y is galois n is a simple connection with trivial inertia group and is ramified then n is a simple dy module prop 3 9 such that c n 0 see also proposition 2 14 concretely consider the cyclic extension a c y b c x y xn and the connection e dbex see 5 2 2 the galois group is cn where is a primitive root of unity and we have x kx 1 k x dlog b k 1 n 1 so that the inertia group ge e cn then e is a simple da module that is not finite over a moreover is not fully faithful when extended to a functor between the cate gories of holonomic d modules proof 1 by theorem 7 4 r f t m 0 hence since m is semisim ple th 3 21 hence t m is semisimple it follows that r f t m c 0 and therefore by grothendieck s non vanishing theorem t m c 0 so by c m mc 2 first recall that is exact prop 2 10 hence c is exact moreover is exact on con y therefore c is exact hence connections being of finite length as d modules one can assume that n andm are simple connections then c m m follows from 1 and theorem 3 14 7 2 canonical stratifications and filtrations a stratification of a smooth va riety x is a finite collection xi i i of mutually disjoint locally closed smooth subvarieties xi such that x i ixi and the closure x i j ixj is a union of strata here we order the index set i by reverse domination so that j i when xj belongs to the closure x i of xi this defines a partial order i such that the canonical filtration that will be discussed below is increasing since x is irreducible there exists a unique minimal index is such that xis is dense in x and putting xif we have is i if for all i i we say that is and if indexes the initial and final stratas of xi i d modules and finite maps 95 a stratification xi i ij yj j j of a morphism x y of varieties is a stratification yj j j of y and a stratification xi j j i ij of x such that 1 yj i ij xi there exists a canonical stratification of a finite morphism x y of schemes of finite type such that the restriction to the stratas of x are e tale it will be the coarsest such stratification in a natural sense the construction is included since it has not been spelled out in the literature in sufficient detail for our needs remark 7 7 in singularity theory one often requires finer stratifications satisfying contact conditions such as the whitney stratification we will however work only with restrictions to e tale strata in an algebraically defined canonical stratification in order to decompose ox we will stepwise add new locally closed smooth strata to x and y so that strata added in one step are not dominated by any of the other new ones but instead are dominated by some stratum in the previous step first make a base change x y r of with respect to the reduced subscheme y r y let xr be the reduced scheme of x and r xr x y r be the composed map since r is a finite map of reduced schemes of finite type defined over a field of characteristic 0 there exists a maximal open subset y 0 y r such that the base change x 0 y 0 is e tale let yj j j 0 be the connected components of y 0 so that each base change x 0 j yj of xr y r is e tale let xi i ij be the connected components of x 0 j so that i ijxi x 0 j j j 0 put y 1 y r y 0 and let 1 x 1 y 1 be the base change of r over y 1 y r we can now replace by 1 and proceed inductively thus having defined x l 1 and y l 1 and l 1 x l 1 y l 1 we get y l y rl 1 y 0 l 1 l x l y l which is the base change of r l 1 over y l y l 1 r we get for l 1 2 y l y 0 l x l y l y l j jl yj x l j i ij xi yj where yj are the connected components of y l the base change x l y l over y l y r is e tale and xi are the connected components of x l j by construction the restrictionxi yj j jl i ij is an e tale map of connected smooth varieties since schemes of finite type only have finitely many connected components and since in each step the dimensions of the new strata are of strictly lower dimension we end up in finite index sets j l 0 1 jl and i l 0 1 j jl ij such that xi yj i ij j j forms a stratification of where the index sets i ij and j are partially ordered by reversed specialization of the corresponding strata we summarize the above construction as follows proposition 7 8 there exists a stratification xi i ij yj j j of such that each restriction xi yj is e tale and such that if xk k i yl l j is another stratification of such that each restriction x k y l is e tale then x k y l is a refinement of xij yk i e each stratum xi is a union of strata x k we call the family of strata xi yj i ij j j in proposition 7 8 the canonical stratification of our main interest is in filtrations of dy modules m defined by requiring the vanishing of local cohomology along successively deeper strata yi in the canonical stratification such a filtration however does not exist for general m for if m 1 m 2 are submodules of m and s a closed subset of x such that r s m 1 96 rolf ka llstro m r s m 2 0 it follows that for the sum m 12 m 1 m 2 the complex r s m 12 is a translation of r s m 1 m 2 one step to the left and this complex need not be 0 in the derived category therefore when m is not semisimple there may exist more than one maximal submodule with vanishing local cohomology along s lemma 7 9 let m be a coherent semisimple d module and s be a locally closed subset of x then there exists a unique maximal coherent submodule ms m such that r s ms 0 proof let s be the set of coherent submodules m ofm such that r s m 0 and put ms m s m the modules m are locally generated by their sections over a fixed affine neigh bourhood andm is coherent so locally only a finite number of termsm contribute to ms since m is semisimple and coherent therefore ms is coherent also since m is semisimple it follows that r s ms 0 by construction ms is the unique maximal coherent submodule with vanishing local cohomology along s we can therefore make the following definition definition 7 10 for a coherent semisimple dx module m and a locally closed subset s of x let ms be the maximal coherent submodule of m whose local cohomology r s ms 0 remark 7 11 assume that s is closed in x put u x s and let j u x be the open inclusion if m is simple and ms m then m j j m see the appendix in section 9 but the converse does not hold so that even ifm j j m is simple it can happen that ms 0 if codimx s 2 take m ox the dc 1 module m c x 1 x x is simple when 6 z and m m 0 let s 1 be a locally closed subset of the closure s of s then in general r s 1 ms 6 0 even if m is simple holonomic and r s ms 0 if m is simple then ms s 1 ms 1 but in general ms 6 ms 1 example 7 12 let m be a simple holonomic dx module torsion free as ox module and s 1 s x be closed algebraic subsets such that codims s 1 1 let j x s 1 x be the locally closed inclusion morphism if j r s m 0 then r s m r s 1 m and the latter complex need not be isomorphic to 0 even ifm is simple and holonomic for an example let x c 2 s 1 0 s v xy x y and put m dc 2 x 1 y 2 x y 3 where i q z and 1 2 3 z the module m is of length 2 and contains a unique simple submodule m torsion free over ox such that supp m m s 1 see 13 th 1 3 since m has vanishing local cohomology along s s s 1 it follows that r s m r s 1 m 6 0 where the non vanishing follows since the minimal extension m of j m j m is a proper submodule of j j m j j m m here ms m and ms 1 0 given a semisimple dy module n and the canonical stratification yi i j of y we define the modules ni nxj as in definition 7 10 njf n and njs 0 resulting in a family of submodules nj j j which we call the canonical submodules of n as noted above in general nj j j need not form a filtration of n with respect to the partially ordered set j i e j 1 j 2 does not imply nj 1 nj 2 27 it is perhaps therefore all the more suprising shall we see that nevertheless the semisimple module n ox satisfies such inclusions 27 of course replacing yj by its closure y j in the definition of nj always results in a filtration d modules and finite maps 97 7 3 maximal e tale and minimal totally ramified factorizations let a ma ka b mb kb be an injective finite homomorphism of local noetherian domains so we can identify a with a subring of b then a b is totally ramified if specb speca is totally ramified as in definition 7 2 i e the induced map of residue fields is an isomorphism ka kb we are interested in certain factorizations by inclusions of local rings a ma ka c mc kc b mb kb next lemma is well known lemma 7 13 1 b a is e tale and c a is unramified b c and c a are e tale 2 b a is totally ramified b c and c a are totally ramified 3 if b a is finite e tale and totally ramified then a b remark 7 14 1 if a homomorphism of local rings a b is totally ramified and b c a is a factorization where c a is e tale then a c 2 if a b is e tale and b c a is a factorization where b c is totally ramified then c b the properties that b a be e tale and totally ramified respectively are preserved in opposite directions with respect to generization and specialization lemma 7 15 let p be a prime ideal in b and put q a p 1 if a b is e tale then aq bp is e tale 2 if aq bp is totally ramified and a q is normal then a q b p and therefore a b is totally ramified proof 1 is well known 2 since kq aq qaq kp bp pbp it follows that a q b p is a finite birational map and since a q in integrally closed in its fraction field a q b p say that an inclusion of local rings a ct b is a minimal totally ramified factorization if ct b is totally ramified and if c t is another totally ramified factorization a c t b then there exists an isomorphism ct c t where c t fits in a factorization a c t c t b making the natural diagrams commute a maximal e tale factorization is a local k subalgebra ce of b that contains a a ce b such that a ce is e tale and if c e is another such e tale a algebra a c e b then there exists an isomorphism c e ce where c e fits in a factorization a c e c e b making the natural diagrams commute theorem 7 16 assume that a is regular and b is normal there exists a maximal e tale factorization a ce b the following are equivalent for a factorization a c b 1 b c a is a maximal e tale factorization 2 b c a is a minimal totally ramified factorization the factorization is unique up to a choice of galois cover of the field extension k b k a thus in this situation ce ct and the maximal e tale minimal totally ramified factorization a ce b is unique up to nonunique isomorphism we often abuse the terminology and say that the local ring c itself is a minimal totally ramified maximal e tale factorization when its position in a b is given from the context theorem 7 16 is proven similarly to the following global version 98 rolf ka llstro m theorem 7 17 let x y be a finite morphism of normal varieties regarded as schemes and s be a finite subset of x then there exists a factorization q p x p z q y such that q is maximally e tale at all points z 1 of height 1 that specialize to z p x this factorization is unique up to a choice of galois cover of the field extension k x k y if y is smooth at x then q is maximally e tale at z and z is smooth at z the map p is totally ramified along s and if x y is galois then p is minimally totally ramified along p s if k x k y is not galois then p need not be totally ramified example con sider a finite morphism of curves x y over an algebraically closed field if there exists a point y in y such xy b is a proper subset of the full fibre xy then it totally ramified along xy but not along y remarks 7 18 1 if the closure x of x s is normal then p is minimally totally ramified and q is maximally e tale for all points in x lem 7 15 2 therefore if s is a closed normal subvariety of x and q p is a factor ization such that p is minimally totally ramified and q is maximally e tale at all generic points of s then the same holds at all points of s 2 notice that if b c a is a minimal maximal totally ramified e tale fac torization and p is a prime ideal of b pc c p q p a then we get maps bp pp cpc qp aq where pp and qp are totally ramified and e tale respectively but they need not be a minimal maximal totally ramified e tale factorization of bp aq 3 when xa and ya are complex manifolds the existence of maximal e tale factorization can be argued for topologically the index of the image 1 xa 1 ya of the fundamental group 1 xa in 1 ya is finite then it is well known that there exists an e tale map q z y such that q 1 za f 1 xa and also that there exists a lifting p xa za such that q p 4 the proof of theorem 7 16 combined with an application of g a g a gives a straightforward proof of 78 th 1 2 which states given a finite holo morphic map of projective normal complex varieties x y there exists a factorization q p where q z y is e tale at points of height 1 moreover up to isomorphism there exists a unique maximal such map q recall that for a galois morphism x y with galois group g the decompo sition group gx of a point x in x is the subgroup of automorphisms that stabilizes x and its inertia group ix is the subgroup of gx of elements whose induced action on the residue field kx x is trivial proof let s x x be the map from the integral closure of x in the galois cover of the field extension k x k y g be the galois group of k x k y h the galois group of k x k x and put r x y let x 1 be a point of height 1 that specialises to x then there exist points x 1 x in x such that x 1 specializes to x s x x and s x 1 x 1 let ix and ix 1 be the inertia groups of the points and put z x x ix z x 1 x ix 1 let px x z x and px 1 x z x 1 be the corresponding invariant maps since ix 1 is a subgroup of ix there exists also a map rx 1 z x 1 z x such that px rx 1 px 1 let zx be the integral closure of y in the intersection of the fraction fields of x and z x regarded as subfields of the fraction field of x and let px x zx and qx zx y be the natural maps so that qx px and there exists also a natural map rx z x zx such that d modules and finite maps 99 rx px px s we have the following diagram 7 3 1 x z x x zx y px s rx px qx the map x zx is galois and its galois group gh x is the the subgroup of g that is generated by ix and h since ix already belongs to the decomposition subgroup gx of g it follows that if dx is the decomposition subgroup of gh x and hx is the decomposition subgroup of h then kx x k hx x x kdx x x kz z hence px is totally ramified at x but not necessarily at px x z when hg 6 gh for some g ix the maps px and px 1 however are minimal totally ramified at z p x x and z 1 px 1 x 1 respectively since x 1 and hence also z 1 px 1 x 1 and qx 1 z 1 x 1 y 1 are points of height 1 in x z x 1 and y respectively and all appearing varieties being normal we get inclusions of discrete valuation rings oy y 1 ozx 1 z 1 ox x 1 we are therefore in the situation of 18 7 prop 21 and can conclude that the first inclusion is e tale since oy y 1 ozx z 1 ozx 1 z 1 and zx is normal it follows that qx is e tale at z 1 r z 1 if y is smooth at x then qx is e tale at z by the purity of branch locus and then z k is smooth at z there exists therefore for each point x in s a factorization x px zx qx y such that qx px where px is totally ramified at x and at px x if k x k y is galois so that x x and qx is e tale at all points of height 1 in z x that specialises to px x if s x 1 xr put z zx 1 y zx 2 y y zxr and let x p z q y be the canonical maps then q is maximally e tale at all points of height 1 that specialises to a point in p s and as before if y s is a regular point in y then q is e tale above y the map p is totally ramified along s and if k x k y is galois and thus x x then p is minimally totally ramified at the points in p s z 7 4 e tale coverings for e tale trivial connections and galois coverings for finite modules let y k be a normal projective variety over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 and consider finite surjective maps of normal varieties assumed connected 7 4 1 x p x y where the fraction field l if x is galois over the fraction field l and k of x and y respectively let g be the galois group of l k if m is an l trivial connection on y so that l k mk lm where mk is the generic stalk of m then it follows that m is a trivial connection on x assume now that m is only a locally free oy module such that n m is a trivial locally free ox module i e n ox k v where v x n then n can be regarded as a connection by declaring that tx acts trivially on v and we 100 rolf ka llstro m will see that in fact m itself is a connection such that m n th 7 20 in general if y had not been projective it is not sufficient that n m be trivial to conclude that m is a connection one would require that x y be a galois cover and that n moreover be a dx g module see 3 1 it is natural to ask whether the maps and can be factorized so that m becomes trivial over an intermediate e tale galois cover theorem 7 19 let x p z q y be a factorization of the morphism where q is maximally e tale see theorem 7 17 for a connection m on y the following are equivalent 1 m is trivial 2 q m is trivial proof we only need to prove 1 2 and can assume that 6 q let x s x y be a galois cover of so that x is the integral closure of x in the fraction field of x there exists a factorization x p z r z q y such that p is totally ramified and r p is maximally e tale and a map p x z such that p s r p see proof of theorem 7 17 by construction k z is the invariant field of the group g that is generated by the union of the galois groups of k x k z and k x k x putting m q m we have for some integer m r m p c p r m p c omx pc p omz o m z where the first and last isomorphisms follow from theorem 7 6 hence r m is trivial since also p m m is trivial it follows that m is a trivial dl g module hence by galois descent prop 3 4 m k z is a trivial dk z module hence m is trivial following nori 73 say that a locally free oy module m is finite if there exists a galois cover q z y such that q m is a trivial vector bundle the assertion that a vector bundle m is finite if m is a trivial vector bundle was proven in 72 y smooth projective using the tannakian formalism and 71 y normal projective using the harder narashiman filtration theorem 7 20 1 contains their result when the characteristic is 0 with a more direct proof the result 26 th 2 15 is similar to 2 below but the argument here is less involved theorem 7 20 let y k be a normal proper variety over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic 0 and consider the diagram 7 4 1 1 let m be a locally free and coherent oy module and assume that m is a trivial ox module there exists a factorization x p x r z q y where all varieties are normal and proper q is a galois cover and q m is trivial 2 the category of finite vector bundles that are trivial after pulling back by the galois cover q z y is the same as the category of l 1 e tale trivial connections on y where l 1 is the fraction field of z remark 7 21 1 if there exist a surjective proper morphism 1 x 1 y such that 1 m is trivial and 1 p is a stein factorization with finite and p has connected fibres then m is also trivial 2 a simple dy module is monomial i e m for some and rank 1 module if and only if l k mk m as dl module m dimkmk and m is a monomial connection if and only if m splits into a sum of rank 1 connections in theorem 7 20 only e tale trivial connections are mentioned but the assertion should be possible to generalize so that any d modules and finite maps 101 covering connection is a submodule of a monomial module with respect to an e tale map proof 1 the galois group of l k acts on x and m and also on the global sections v x m let h be the kernel of the map g glk v put z x h and let p x z be the invariant map since x is connected for a closed point x mapping to the point z in z x ox kx x kz z k since k is algebraically closed and x is proper since p q m m ox k v it follows that v x m kx x ox x m kz z oz z q m km where m rankm dimk v and z q m z p q m h z ox k v h z ohx k v v implying that q m is also trivial let g 1 g h be the galois group of k z k so that q z y is generically galois to see that q is actually e tale it suffices to see that the stabilisator subgroup gz 1 of any closed point z in z is trivial this follows since the map g 1 glk v is injective and gz 1 acts trivially on the right side of it remains to see that the galois group of p belongs to h so that we get a factorization x x z as asserted this follows by considering the case when m is already trivial m oy k v since then the whole group g acts trivially on v 2 since z is connected in 1 z oz k as k is algebraically closed first assuming that m is a locally free and finite oy module we show that it is also an e tale trivial connection since q m is a trivial oz module q m oz k v we have v z q m and in particular l 1 k mk l 1 k v where v is a representation of g 1 and v mk in theorem 5 31 moreover since q is a galois covering m oz k v g 1 which evidently is a connection on y prop 3 4 conversely if m is an l 1 e tale trivial connection then q m is a connection that is generically trivial and therefore trivial corollary 7 22 assume thatm is a locally free oy module on a simply connected normal projective variety y over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 if there exists a surjective proper morphism x y such that m is trivial then m is trivial proof by remark 7 21 one can assume that is finite and by theorem 7 20 there exists a galois cover q z y such that q m is a trivial connection so that if g is the galois group of q then m q m g is a connection which is trivial since y is simply connected alternative q q m is a connection prop 5 4 which is trivial since y is simply connected in particular it is a trivial oy module the trace morphism gives a split of the adjoint morphism m 1 n tr i q q m where n is the degree of q therefore m is a trivial oy module one wants to apply corollary 7 22 to get a criterion that a locally free oy module m on a simply connected variety be trivial the idea is that if there exists a point y in y such that any other point in y can be connected by a subvariety c a member of an algebraically parametrized family and if the restriction of m to each c is trivial then m should also be trivial this idea was considered in 2 when the c are stable rational curves and y is rationally connected and we therefore do not claim essential originality the main goal being to clarify and connect to the present context 102 rolf ka llstro m we have then a diagram with vertices formed by normal projective varieties over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 7 4 2 x y p g where is a surjective a section of p so that p id and g proposition 7 23 assume that p is proper the following are equivalent for a locally free oy module m 1 m is a trivial locally free ox module 2 g m is a trivial o module and p p m m so that m is trivial relative to p 3 m is a connection such that m is trivial proof 3 1 is evident and 1 2 follows since k is algebraically closed and p is proper 2 3 putting m m we have since p p m m and p id g m m p p m p m so that p m is trivial hence m is a trivial ox module since x and y are proper the map is also defined at points x of height 1 since m is trivial it is the restriction is proper in other words m is a finite module so by theorem 7 20 it is a connection such that m is trivial the following result gives a sufficient condition that ensures that two locally free modules are isomorphic proposition 7 24 let m and n be locally free sheaves on a variety x assume that n ni n 1 ox rj 1 n 1 j where the ni and nij n i ox nj are invertible sheaves the following are equivalent 1 m m 1 ox rj 1 n 1 j where m 1 is an invertible sheaf 2 we have an isomorphism of locally free sheaves endox m endox n proof 1 2 is clear 2 1 select splittings n ji pi ni so that pi ji is an automorphism of ni and put also i ji pi which is an endomorphism of n that restricts to an automorphism of ni and i j ij i letting denote an isomorphism in 2 the elements i 1 i form global sections of endox m and we have i j ij i puttingmi im i m we then have i mj 0 when i 6 j and i defines an isomorphism mi mi and mi mj 0 when i 6 j hence the inclusions mi m induce an isomorphism r i 1 mi m moreover endox ri 1 mi endox ri 1 ni implies that homox mi mj homox ni nj nij hence the modules mi are invertible and mj n 1 j ox m 1 this implies 1 it can be hard to directly check 2 in proposition 7 24 but at least when y is simply connected it can be used to reach a more precise result this was discussed already in the proof of 2 th 2 2 where the main ideas were presented d modules and finite maps 103 theorem 7 25 consider the diagram 7 4 2 where moreover y is simply con nected if m l r for some invertible ox module l then there exists an invertible oy module l such that m lr proof by proposition 7 23 endoy m is a connection which is trivial since y is simply connected then the assertion follows from proposition 7 24 putting n ory and hence n 1 j oy corollary 7 26 let y be a rationally connected smooth projective variety and m be a locally free oy module 1 the following are equivalent a m is trivial b the pullback m is trivial for each map p 1 k y 2 the following are equivalent a m lr for some invertible module l on y b the pullback m l r for some invertible module l on p 1 k and each non constant map p 1 k y proof in either case we only need to prove b a since x is rationally con nected there exists a diagram of the type 7 4 2 where the fibres of p form trees of stable rational curves and the map g is constant put m m 1 the condi tion b implies that the restriction ofm to a tree of stable rational curves is trivial this implies that the canonical map p p m m is an isomorphism and since moreover g is constant 2 in proposition 7 23 is satisfied hencem is a connection hence m is trivial by corollary 6 21 2 the ox module m endox m is trivial along each fibre of p and is therefore trivial as in the proof of 1 hence by propositions 7 23 and 7 24 m l r for some invertible sheaf l and then the assertion follows from theorem 7 25 7 5 trace characterization of the canonical submodules we will study the canonical submodules nj of n ox 28 using the canonical stratification of xi yj j j i ij to each stratum xi i ij we can associate a factorization x pi zi qi y as in theorem 7 17 we have for corresponding generic points xi qi zi yj here qi is maximally e tale at the point zi pi xi and pi is minimally totally ramified at the generic point xi of xi but if x y is not galois then pi need not be totally ramified at pi xi zi see definition 7 2 so that theorem 7 4 is not applicable therefore similarly to the proof of theorem 7 17 we need to take a field extension l l k x k k y such that l k and l l are galois referring to the diagram 7 3 1 we in particular have maps x s x y where x is the integral closure of x in l so that l k x the inertia scheme zxi of the stratum xi is in general singular so that the notation pi ox as dzi module need not be meaningful however the point zi is smooth and also smooth over yj so that the dzxi zi module pi ox zi is well defined 28 it is possible to extend the treatment to modules of the form n c where c is any semisimple connection on y 104 rolf ka llstro m to clarify the definition of inertia modules below it can be helpful to first consider the commutative diagram b c b c p s p r of free c algebras where c is noetherian and that the maps s and p make b and b free algebras over b and c respectively the maps p s p r are inclusion maps the trace morphism trb c b c is described in 2 3 and we put tb a ker trb a we have trb c trc c trb c trb c trb b let trb c b c be the restriction of trb c to b b so that trc c trb c h trb c where h denotes the rank of b over b and put also t b c b tb c ker trb c tb c returning to sheaves consider the trace morphism trz i p i ox z i ozx i z i let h be the galois group of l l and define the induced map trz i pi ox zi p i ox hz i ozx i z i in the diagram we have b ox xi b ox x i c ozxi zi c ozx i z i and trzi trb c extended via the map pi ox zi pi ox zi remark 7 27 if is a local section of pi ox zi its value trz i g ix i g the reynold s operator needs not belong to oh zx i z i ozxi zi the reason is that in general hix i 6 ix ih h h however trz i 0 if and only if trz i 0 when z i and z i lie over the same point zi since ox is the minimal extension of ox yj the image of the trace morphism qi trzi ox yj q i ozx i z i ox yj has a unique extension to a homomorphism of semisimple modules tri ox ox to emphasize tri is the ordinary trace relative to pxi only when x y is galois definition 7 28 the inertia submodule of ox corresponding to the stratum xi i ij is defined by ti ker tri one of our main results is that the inertia modules determine the submodules nj of n and that these modules form a filtration theorem 7 29 nj i ij ti corollary 7 30 the sequence of modules nj jfj js forms an increasing filtration of n ox so that nj 1 nj 2 when j 2 j 1 we call nj j j the canonical filtration of ox with respect to the poset j notice that njs 0 since n is torsion free and njf n since n 0 d modules and finite maps 105 remark 7 31 let n 1 be a submodule of n s be a locally closed subset of y and s its closure corollary 7 30 gives the condition that if r s n 1 0 then r s n 1 0 for example the simple module m in example 7 12 cannot occur in n for any finite map x c 2 proof since j 1 j 2 so that yj 2 y j 1 we have i ij 2 xi xyj 2 xy j 1 x yj 1 i ij 1 x i since each closure x i i ixi disjoint union and by the construction of the canonical stratification for each stratum xi 2 i 2 ij 2 i there exists a stratum xi 1 i 1 ij 1 i such that xi 2 x i 1 therefore there exists a map zi 1 zi 2 such that pi 1 pi 2 implying that ti 1 ti 2 therefore i 1 ij 1 ti 1 i 2 ij 2 ti 2 so we can conclude by theorem 7 29 corollary 7 32 1 if i j then nj yi ni and ni yj nj 2 if y i y j then ni yj nj yi nyi yj proof 1 this follows from corollary 7 30 2 since y i y j we have r yi yj r yi r yj therefore the maximal submodule with vanishing local cohomology along y i y j is the maximal submodule with vanishing local cohomology both along yi and yj the assertion now follows from 1 recall that ox oy t corollary 7 33 let j 1 j 2 js jr be a path in j where jr 6 jf 1 njr nj 1 nj 2 nj 1 njr njr 1 t where the semisimple module njs njs 1 has no common non zero simple component with njs njs 1 when js 6 js i e homdy njs njs 1 njs njs 1 0 2 if is totally ramified at some point that maps to the generic point of yjr then ox nj 1 nj 2 nj 1 njr njr 1 oy proof 1 corollary 7 30 implies nj 1 njr t the direct sum de composition and the fact that the modules njs njs 1 are semisimple follows since ox is semisimple th 3 21 if n js is a nonzero simple module in njs njs 1 it follows that r y js n js 0 while r y j n js 6 0 when j js this implies the remaining assertion 2 since is totally ramified at a point x xi i ijr it follows that t njr since oy njr 0 and n oy t it follows that t njr now the assertion follows from 1 when j j j are unrelated with respect to there is no general relation between nj and nj in section 8 2 we give an example where nj nj while j 6 j and j 6 j and one can also have nj nj when j j so that the filtration needs not be strictly increasing notice that there may exist several paths in j joining j 1 and jr and thus giving rise to different decompositions of njr 106 rolf ka llstro m proof of theorem 7 29 a first assume that x y is galois let qi pi be the factorization of the stratum xi x i ij so that pi x zi is minimally totally ramified at the generic point xi of xi and qi zi y is maximally e tale at zi pi xi th 7 17 let y j be the closure of the stratum yj xi and yj y j yj its boundary put xy j 1 y j x yj 1 yj and g i xy j xi so that g i is a closed set and x yj i ij g i let i x g i x and i y y i y be the open inclusions similarly define the open inclusion i z 0 i zi pi g i zi and the restriction of pi p 0 i x g i zi pi g i so that pi i i p 0 i putting n 0 j i ij ti we need to prove n 0 j nj where ti is the minimal extension of the semisimple module qi t 0 i yj from the point yj xi to y and t 0 i ker tr pi ox zi ozi zi notice that t 0 i is only a dzi zi module below all functors are derived n 0 j nj since r g i r x yj r g i we have the distinguished triangle in local cohomology r g i ox r xy j ox i i i r xy j ox 1 so that by theorem 7 1 we get the triangle a r g i ox ri r y j ox i i i r xy j ox 1 where i i the split inclusion ti ox yj of dy yj modules induces a split homomorphism li r y j ti yj r y j ox yj where we assert that b i yj li 0 assuming b we get a morphism l 0 i r y j ti yj r g i ox yj such that li ri yj l 0 i 29 therefore one gets a split homomorphism r y j i ij ti yj r i ijg i ox yj r x yj ox yj r yj ox yj 0 where in the last step theorem 7 1 is again applied therefore suppr y j n 0 j yj so that n 0 j nj we now prove b putting zy j q 1 i y j so that zy j pi xi pi g i hence by theorem 7 4 r zy j t 0 i zi 0 so according to theorem 7 1 r y j ti yj r y j qi t 0 i yj qi r zy j t 0 i zi yj 0 c let x i be the closure of xi and put x i pi xi we have for the stalk at yj of the third term in a as detailed below i i r x i ox yj qi pi i i r x i ox yj qi i p 0 i i r x i ox yj qi i p 0 i r xi i ox yj qi i r x i p 0 i i ox yj qi i r x i oz 0 i t 0 i yj qi i r x i oz 0 i yj 29 this follows from one of the axioms of triangulated categories d modules and finite maps 107 the first equality of the third line follows from theorem 7 1 and the very last step is a consequence of theorem 7 4 by c this implies that i yj li maps to qi i r x i i t 0 i yj 0 th 7 4 nj n 0 j we need to prove that nj ti for all i ij since ox is semisimple it suffices to prove that ifm 0 is a non zero simple component of ox and if there exists an index i such that m 0 6 ti then r yj m 0 yj 6 0 the generic point zi of pi xi zi maps to yj and since ox is torsion free we have the non zero dy yj submodule m 0 yj qi ozi zi yj by theorem 7 17 zi k and zi y are smooth at zi so that the dy yj module qi ozi yj is of finite type over oy yj hence by grothendieck s non vanishing theorem all its non zero submodules have non vanishing local cohomology 20 th 3 5 7 therefore r yj m 0 yj r myj m 0 yj 6 0 this completes the proof when is galois b when is not galois we consider a galois cover and refer to the diagram 7 3 1 if h is the galois group of x x putting n ox we have n n h see also corollary 3 35 and nj n j h the set s 1 xi x is a union of locally closed irreducible sets x x let x i be a generic point of x to x i there is associated a canonical factorization x p z x i r zxi q y and a map p x zxi so that p s r p we refer to the proof of theorem 7 17 for more details and the notation the map p x i is totally ramified along z i and therefore by a n j i ij t x i so we get nj n h j i ij t x i h i ij ti where we note that if x i and x i both lie above xi then t hx i t h x i 7 6 generators and decomposition of the inertia modules regard the par tially ordered set i ij that is determined by the canonical stratification of x y as a directed graph with a directed edge i 1 e i 2 when i 1 i 2 and if i 2 i i 1 then either i i 1 or i i 2 this directed graph lies over the directed specialization graph of the stratifaction yj of y if i 1 iji i 2 ij 2 and there is an edge i 1 e i 2 we get an edge j 1 j 2 in the directed graph j the factorizations qi pi qi 1 pi 1 are compatible in the sense that there exists a map re zi 1 zi 2 corresponding to the edge e such that pi 2 re pi 1 and qi 1 qi 2 re so that we have the maps x pi 1 zi 1 re zi 2 qi 2 y assume now for simplicity that is galois otherwise use the galois cover x x as described in 7 5 and recall first how the inertia module ti corresponding to the stratum xi i ij is defined we have pi ox z ozi z t 0 i z if zi is singular this is defined as a dzi z module only at points z that specialize to pi xi where xi is the generic point of xi put si xi xi speca y then ti is the minimal extension of qi t 0 i from y si to the whole of y 108 rolf ka llstro m theorem 7 34 assume that xi 1 is a stratum of codimension 2 then there exists an exact sequence of dy modules 0 i i 1 i i 1 i 6 i ti ti i i 1 ti ti 1 0 proof consider points z 1 zi 1 lying below points zi that specialize to pi xi for some i i 1 then ti 1 z 1 re ti z 1 tre z 1 if a simple module w 6 re ti for all i i 1 then since re is e tale at all points of height 1 that specialize to pi xi wz i 1 is of finite type over ozi 1 z i when ht z i 1 therefore since w is torsion free by grothendieck s finiteness theorem w is coherent over ozi 30 prop 3 2 hence by grothendieck s non vanishing theorem r mzi 1 wzi 1 6 0 and therefore wzi 1 6 ti 1 zi 1 this implies that the sequence is exact on the right the exactness on the left is straightforward theorem 7 35 the following are equivalent 1 ti nj 2 for all i ij we have i i proof by theorem 7 29 nj i ij ti and ti ti if and only if i i this implies the assertion 8 complex reflection groups let a k y 1 yn b k x 1 xn be a finite injective homomorphism of polynomial rings and x specb y speca be its associated map the main problems concerned with the dy module ox are to determine i a set of generators ii a presentation iii its canonical filtration iv a semisimple decomposition in this generality for all such this project is quite formidable and in this section we will merely get some answers to i iv for invariant maps x ank y xg for a complex reflection group g where by a theorem of shephard and todd y ank in section 8 2 the canonical filtration of n ox 7 5 is explicitly decom posed into simple modules when g is the symmetric group sn section 8 3 contains a presentation of the direct image e of certain exponential modules e where e 0 ox and section 8 4 is about decomposing ox when g is an imprim itive complex reflection group using natural generalizations of young or specht polynomials 8 1 generators first in greater generality provide b with the usual grading so that the xi have degree 1 and assume that is homogeneous so that the elements yi are homogeneous polynomials of some degrees di deg yi as elements in b then the jacobian j det yi xj is homogeneous of degree deg j n i 1 di 1 let xi yj i ij j j be the canonical stratification of and x pi zi qi y be a factorization such that pi is minimally totally ramified along the generic point xi of xi and qi is e tale along the image of xi in x i pi xi zi in general the variety zi need not be smooth assume that a bg b is the inclusion of the invariant ring with respect to a group g that is generated by pseudo reflections of x now the stratifica tion xi are formed as flats in an arrangement of hyperplanes see 87 theorem 6 27 1 thus xi is formed as an intersection of hyperplanes after removing higher codimensional intersections also in this case the inertia subgroups are themselves d modules and finite maps 109 complex reflection groups ibid theorem 6 25 86 prop 26 6 and this implies by chevalley s theorem 86 props 18 3 18 5 that all varieties zi that occur in a minimal totally ramified factorizations x zi y again are isomorphic to cn moreover the branch locus b is a union of hyperplanes b h ah and the jacobian is of the form j h a eh 1 h where eh is the order of the inertia group which is a cyclic group of the hyperplane h that is defined by the linear form h letting be the set of all divisors of j it is natural to look in for generators of b and or its simple submodules proposition 8 1 b da trb a 1 1 remark 8 2 when g sn it suffices to take only the subset of formed by the divisors that occur as jacobians of the totally ramified morphisms x zi these are the specht polynomials and the simples in b are precisely the modules that are generated by such polynomials on the other hand if g is a weyl group of type d 2 n then there exist simple modules that are not generated by a divisor of j see example 8 17 proof let k 1 n be the ring of differential operators of b with constant coefficients then the space of harmonic polynomials is of the form h k 1 n j b bg so that b ah now the assertion follows since the set k 1 n j is contained in the k linear hull of the set of all divisors of j 30 8 2 canonical filtrations for symmetric groups let x cn y cn be the invariant map a bsn b c x 1 xn let tn be the set of partitions p pi ri 1 of the set n 1 n so that pi pj i 6 j pi n and pi 6 1 i r let pn be the set of partitions of the integer n n so that given p tn we get p pn where p i pi we order the partitions p p 1 pr tn and p pn so that p i p i 1 1 so that p is given by a young tableaux of shape given by the young diagram of p say that p tn is a refinement of q tn if there exists a partition i ij of r such that qj i ijpi and then write q p this defines a partial order in tn similarly if for a there exists a partition i such that j i ij i then clearly q p q p we call the partial order on tn and pn respectively the specialization order as explained by the proposition below given p tn we can associate the linear subspace x p ixpi where x pi xk xl k l pi then x q x p if and only if q gp for some element g sn and we put y x p where p recall that the dominance order e is defined by the condition 1 i j i 1 i j i for all j 1 proposition 8 3 1 the closure of the stratas of the canonical stratifica tion of are given by x p p tn and y pn where x 1 y p x p and x p y 30 this argument is due to r bo gvad 110 rolf ka llstro m 2 the specialization order of the strata x p p tn is the same as the special ization order on tn that is x p x q q p 3 the specialization order on y pn is the same as the specialization order on p that is y y 4 the specialization order on pn is coarser then the dominance order so that if then e we leave out the straightforward proof the semisimple decomposition of the dy module n ox can be described as follows the specht polynomials which are jacobians of the map x zq computed in canonical homogeneous coordinates is of the form sq x jx zq qi x where the van der monde determinant qi x r s qi r s xr xs corresponding to the partition q the partition has the shape s q i e i qi so that as is customary the sets qi form the columns of a tableaux of shape 31 here is the conjugate partition of so that the columns of the young diagram of are the rows of the diagram of putting q sq trx zq 1 1 n dy q is a simple dy submodule of n and n n m n s q dy q where m is the isotypical component of n that corresponds to the irreducible representation v k sn sp see 40 prop 4 6 theorems 3 27 and 8 15 our main interest in this section is in the condition m n where n is the canonical module corresponding to the stratum y so we want to describe a combinatorial relation between the partititions 1 t 1 s pn written in decreasing order if k is an integer such that 0 k 1 we get a partition k pn k by replacing 1 by 1 k and then reorder in decreasing order in more detail k 2 i 1 k i 1 t where i is the greatest index such that i 1 k or if i 1 k 2 i t then k 1 k 2 i t now if 0 1 1 put 1 1 n 1 and inductively if 0 i i 1 1 put i i 1 i n 1 i we emphasise that the sequence i pni of partitions of the integers ni n 1 i depend on and the process stops when i i 1 1 define the subset p n p i s t i i 1 1 for example if 1 1 then p n while 6 p n proposition 8 4 if e and 6 then p n proof by assumption there exists an integer l such that 1 i l i 1 i l i and 1 i l i 1 i l i this implies that l l and i i 1 i l it now easily follows that l l 1 1 31 this means that ksq is the signature representation of the young group gq d modules and finite maps 111 remark 8 5 since for example 1 1 does not imply e one cannot turn around the implication in proposition 8 4 theorem 8 6 let m be the isotypical component of n ox that corre sponds to the partition n and n be the maximal submodule of n such that r y n 0 where y is the stratum corresponding to the partition n then n p n m proof by theorem 7 29 n s p tp where p is a standard young tableaux of shape indexing the flats xp lying over y the inertia module tp m ox trgp m 0 where the inertia group gp of xp is the young group gp s p 1 s pn therefore dy q n trgp q 0 when s p trgp sq 0 when s p we assert trgp sq 0 i j s t pj qi 2 if pj qi 2 then gp gq contains a transposition of two elements in qi so that trc 2 sq 0 if c 2 implying that trgp sq 0 conversely if pj qi 1 for all i j and sq 6 1 sq then sq j qj contains a polynomial factor of degree 1 that does not occur in 1 sq this implies that for each i trs pi sq s pi sq 6 0 and therefore since pi pi when i 6 i trgp sq trs pn trs p 2 trs p 1 sg 6 0 it remains to prove p n i j s t pj qi 2 assume that pl qj 1 and that j j 1 1 when j i and all l while i 1 1 i let p p s be the conjugate partition of p this is the partition of n that is formed from the columns of the tableaux of p where the rows of the original tableaux are formed from the subsets pi the assumption implies that each set qj j i belongs to a single subset p r now the condition i 1 1 i implies that qi cannot belong to a single subset p r for all r and therefore there exists an integer r such that pr qi 2 that pj qi 2 for some i j implies that qi does not belong to a single subset p r for all r this implies that i i 1 1 we can now determine which isotypical components are added in the canonical filtration upon adding a deeper stratum these are described combinatorially by subsets of pn of the form p n p n 112 rolf ka llstro m corollary 8 7 put n n the maximal submodule of n ox with vanishing local cohomology along all strata y that dominate y and y 6 y then n n and we have n n m one would perhaps expect that the isotypical decomposition of n in some way can be mapped to its canonical decomposition but this turns out not to be the case since the canonical filtration need not be strictly increasing and therefore more than one isotypical component may be added when including a deeper stratum the smallest n when this happens is n 6 example 8 8 a partition is the index of a stratum y in the canonical strat ification where the dimension dim y of a stratum is given by the length of so that e g dimy 2 2 2 for n 4 the specialization order is described by the following diagram 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 1 2 2 4 where the leftmost partition corresponds to the generic point in y the next is the generic point of the discriminant locus and so on the arrows denote specializa tion where we notice that two of the strata are related in the dominance order but not the specialization order to exemplify theorem 8 6 we have n 3 1 m 2 2 m 3 1 m 4 and n 2 2 m 2 1 1 m 3 1 m 4 here 2 2 e 3 1 while 2 2 6 3 1 here 4 3 1 2 2 while consists of a single element when 6 4 so that one then adds a single isotypical component in corollary 8 7 for n 5 we have e g n 3 2 p 3 2 m where p 3 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 3 1 1 2 2 1 here 2 2 1 e 3 1 1 while 2 2 1 6 3 1 1 the graph describing the specialization order for n 6 is as follows 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 3 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 4 1 1 3 2 1 2 2 2 5 1 4 2 3 3 6 by theorem 8 6 we have for example n 4 1 1 p 4 1 1 m where p 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 3 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 3 2 1 2 2 2 3 3 notice that even though 2 2 2 and 3 1 1 1 are unrelated with respect to the dominance order we have p 1 1 1 1 1 so that 1 1 1 2 2 and therefore m m 4 1 1 is contained in n 2 2 2 in corollary 8 7 one d modules and finite maps 113 adds two isotypical components upon adding the stratum y 2 2 2 since 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 3 1 1 1 8 3 presentation of exponential modules for complex reflection groups let g be a complex reflection group in gl v where v is a finite dimensional k space and put x spec s v and y spec s v g an element v defines a maximal ideal m s v and the exponential dx module e dxe dx dxm here e 1 moddxm which is an invertible ox module now put p s v g m dy and m dy dy p theorem 8 9 if g is a complex reflection group then m e by a theorem of steinberg 88 the isotropy group g of is again a complex reflection group then theorem 3 27 gives an abstract decomposition ofm where the inertia group ge g which in 8 4 will be made explicit when g is an imprimitive complex reflection group and 0 theorem 8 9 complements a result due to levasseur and stafford 54 th 4 4 stating that d a d ap e as d a modules in fact a transcription of the first part of the proof below also recovers loc cit in a rather direct and explicit way 32 remark 8 10 1 it follows from the proof that there exists an injective ho morphism l b e dk dkp for any subgroup g gl v and that this is an isomorphism if and only if the inertia group g is generated by pseudo reflections of v the proof also gives that the inverse image l kdk dkp is semisimple and therefore dk dkp is always semisimple th 3 14 2 we do not get a canonical isomorphism in theorem 8 9 or even a canonical cyclic generator of e for instance the canonical homomorphism m e 1 moddy p 7 trx y e is not an isomorphism since dxm dy 6 dy p in the case 0 one asks for a canonical generator of ox as dy module see theorem 3 31 and dxm 0 dy dy ty 6 dy p 0 dy s v g lemma 8 11 let m be a maximal ideal in s v db j be an m primary ideal and put t dimk s v j the dimension of the invariant space db dbj m equals t and if v 1 vt is a basis of db dbj m then db dbj t i 1 dbvi t i 1 db dbm where db dbm is simple it would be interesting to find explicit differential operators pi db that repre sent the basis vi and thus an explicit decomposition ofdb dbj when j s v n and n s v g m in 38 this is accomplished in terms of pochhammer dif ferential operators for modules of the form db dbmn 32 in step 1 one can work with a b and d a db instead of k l and dk dl proving that b a d a d an k g k e and then d a d ap e steps 2 and 3 are then not required 114 rolf ka llstro m proof the decomposition follows from kashiwara s restriction theorem see 38 letting m be any m primary s v module of finite dimension t we prove by induc tion in t that the length of db s v m equals t let mi ti 1 be a decomposition series of m so that dimkmi 1 mi 1 when m is gorenstein as in our main example then the first term is the socle m 1 m m the s v module db is free see loc cit so that if we apply the exact functor db s v to the exact sequence 0 mi mi 1 mi 1 mi 0 and notice that the modules db s v m 1 db s v mi 1 mi db dbm are simple since dimmi t the assertion db s v m dimkm follows by induction lemma 8 12 let n 1 nr s v g be a linearly independent subset and m 1 mr s v g be another subset then there exists a s v g such that ni a mi i 1 r proof the action of constant coefficient differential operators s v on s v also gives s v a structure as simple s v module since ni is linearly independent it follows from the density theorem that there exists b s v such that ni b mi since ni mi s v g it follows that ni ag mi so that putting a 1 g trg a g g a g s v we also have ni a mi proof of theorem 8 9 since g is a complex reflection group s v g is again a polynomial ring and n s v g m is a maximal ideal in s v g such that the fibre s v g n s v g s v k g moreover the map s v g s v g is e tale of degree r g g and s v g p gi g g ngi where ngi are translations of the ideal n s v g m spec s v g and the gi are g transversals in g this implies s v s v p s v g p s v g s v g s v g s v s v g s v g p s v g s v gi g g s v g ngi s v g s v gi g g s v s v ngi next lemma 8 11 implies noting that db b k s v as b s v bimodule dl s v s v s v n

see 86 sec 17 5 since by assumption g is a complex reflection group g is a complex reflection group d modules and finite maps 115 at the generic point in spec s v g we have m dk dkp by and its inverse

gi g g t j 1 l k e gi gi g g t j 1 l k egi dk dkp therefore by adjointness homdk l b e l b e homdk l b e dk dkp since k a e l b e is semisimple this implies that k a e can be identified with a submodule of dk dkp since moreover rankk k a e rankl l be rankl dk dkp rankk dk dkp it follows that k a e dk dkp 2 m is torsion free we need to prove that if f a p da and fp dan then p dan in other words if fp i qisi si n where we can assume that si is a linearly independent subset of s v we need to prove that qi fda by chevalley s theorem there exists a subset yi s v g such that a s v g k yi let yi ta such that yi yj ij when and are multiindices n n we write when is greater in the lexicographic ordering and put y 1 y nn a 1 y 1 n yn da and 1 n now expand qi ai b where ai is a set of multiindices and b a by lemma 8 12 there exist for each monomial y s v g a an element a i s v g a such that sj a i y i j let be the minimal element of ai so that for all 6 iai then fp a i j qjsj a i ai b y b and therefore b af now assume that b f b for some b a when ai as before select a i s v g a such that sj a i y i j it follows that fp a i b f b y 116 rolf ka llstro m where y a hence b fa by induction it follows that b af for all ai and therefore qi fda 3 we have localization maps u m k a m and v e k a e the map u is injective by 2 and by corollary 3 22 e is torsion free hence v is also injective put 1 moddap so that m da and dku k am by 1 there exists an isomorphism k k am k a e so that dk k k a e since v is injective there exists a non zero element h a such that h k e maps to h k now since dah m and the latter module is semisimple so that has a non zero projection to each simple module in a semisimple decomposition we get dah m hence the map that sends h to h k u defines an isomorphism m e 8 4 simple d modules for imprimitive complex reflection groups the irreducible imprimitive reflection subgroup are of the form g g de e n a de e n sn gl v so that if xi ni 1 is an imprimitive basis of v and m de a de e n is the group of diagonal matrices with entries in the group m of mth roots of unity whose determinant belongs to d while sn permutes the xi letting as before b s v and a bg we aim to explicitly describe the semisimple de composition of b when a b is the inclusion map and at the same time present an equally explicit description of representatives of g as subrepresentations of b let l be the fraction field of b l 1 l a de e n and k lg be the fraction field of a 33 we have a factorization 0 q r specl r specl 1 q speck of the restriction of to the generic point in x specb there exists an exact sequence 1 a de e n znm ce 1 where m de and therefore since c e ce and z nm z n m also the exact sequence 1 ce d znm a de e n 0 where d 1 d d znm the irreducible a de e n representations are thus parametrized by elements znm modulo the relation jd 1 for some integer j let denote the class of in a de e n regarding as a function n 0 1 m 1 we get the monomial x n i 1 x i i and can define the dl 1 module dl 1 x then is simple and if and only if concretely the inclusion dl 1 x dl 1 djx dl 1 x is an isomorphism where n i 1 xi so that d l 1 it is therefore unambiguous to write it follows that lemma 8 13 r l a de e n the map q is also galois with galois group sn so to compute 0 l q we need the inertia group g sn of the symmetric group sn acts on the elements by g i g i and g g then g g sn g g sn g d ce let y s 1 0 s 1 1 s 1 m 1 be the product of the symmetric groups of the sets 1 i l n l i n y is a young subgroup of sn put ni 1 i so that ni n 33 the invariant ring b a de e n is singular when e 1 so it is here natural to work with the fraction fields d modules and finite maps 117 lemma 8 14 put b lcm bi where bi is the smallest non zero positive integer such that ni bid ni there exists an exact sequence 1 y g c 1 where c b is a subgroup of ce any irreducible representation of y is of the form vp v 0 k k v m 1 where for each integer partition i ni the irreducible s 1 i representation v i can be realized as the vector space with basis spi c y 1 yni indexed by standard young tableaux pi of shape i the polynomials spi are often selected to be specht or young polynomials for a bijection ni 1 i l 7 j put yl xmj s i pi x spi y and sp m 1 i 0 s i pi let t be a lift of b to g in lemma 8 14 and k t x b 1 i 0 kf i k t be a decomposition as k t module the simple g modules are then of the form vp i kf i k vp now define the following da submodules of b np i da trb a f isp 0 i b theorem 8 15 the modules np i are simple and b a de e n b 1 i 0 s p np i where the sum runs over all sets of standard tabeaux p of shape s p for a set of partitions 0 m 1 i 1 i proof consider first the fraction fields k l and put m dimk vp then q drl 1 dl 1 g dl 1 g dl 1 b 1 i 0 s p drl 1 dl 1 g v m p i k b 1 i 0 s p drl 1 dl 1 g dl 1 g f isp m where dl 1 g f isp is a simple dl 1 g module and therefore dkf i 1 sp is a simple component of q this implies the assertion for the fraction fields so to complete the proof it suffices to see that np i is a simple da module and for this purpose we employ the canonical inclusion b b 4 5 the d a module b is semisimple by theorem 4 16 see also 40 prop 2 2 54 th 3 4 since b is finite over a its semisimple decomposition is determined by its decomposition as dk module at the generic point since f isp b and dkf isp is simple it follows that d af isp is simple now as the image of d af isp in b generates np i theorem 4 16 implies that np i is simple since any vector in np i generates an irreducible representation see theo rem 3 27 we also get 118 rolf ka llstro m corollary 8 16 the representations vp i k g de e n f isp give all the irreducible representations of g de e n and vp i vp

an even number one can have n 0 n 1 so that has an equal number of 0 s and 1 s this implies that c c 2 and k t x kf 0 kf 1 where f 0 n 1 i 1 xi n i n 1 1 xi and f 1 n 1 i 1 xi n i n 1 1 xi remark 8 18 an explicit construction of the irreducible representations of g is given in 6 7 see also 63 by studying the restriction of representations of g d 1 n to its subgroup g de e n which in turn are presented in a classical and computational way using vector spaces with bases indexed by young tableaux in fact in loc cit one defines the action of generators of g d 1 n on such vector spaces as a limiting case of an action that give representations of an associated hecke algebra in corollary 8 16 we work with the quite concrete polynomial ring b and use a more direct approach instead of restrictions from g d 1 n knowing the action of coxeter generators of sn on a polynomial basis sp s p n the indices p are standard young tableaux of given shape of an irreducible representation also gives the action of coxeter generators of g de e n in the basis f isp of vp i thus if sp are young polynomials one gets a counterpart for g de e n of young s seminormal presentation of representations of sn notice also that theorem 8 15 describes all the simple da modules n torsion free over a such that n lr r rankn 9 appendix minimal extensions we present a standard setup involving a triple of functors h f g with certain properties yielding a minimal extension functor s this entails for example the well known functors j j j on constructible sheaves associated with a locally closed embedding j u x of quasi projective varieties where s j was used in 9 to define intersection cohomology see remarks 9 11 and 9 9 for further motivation why this abstract treatment is useful 9 1 abstract minimal extensions let f c 1 c 2 be a functor of abelian categories provided with functors h g c 2 c 1 such that h f and f g form adjoint pairs and therefore have adjoint morphisms hf id gf make also the following assumptions 1 f is exact and essentially surjective 2 h and g are fully faithful we consider the subcategory of c 1 consisting of objects that do not contain subquo tients that are orthogonal to f the precise definition is d modules and finite maps 119 definition 9 1 an object m in c 1 is f strict if for any subobject m 1 m and exact sequence 0 k f m 1 n g 0 upon applying f so that one has the sequence f k f f f m 1 f g f n we have i f f 0 f 0 ii f g 0 g 0 let cstr 1 be the subcategory of strict objects in c 1 if c 1 is closed under the formation of extensions and subquotients then so is cstr 1 remark 9 2 assume that c 1 and c 2 are provided with duality functors d 1 d 2 such that fd 1 d 2 f then cstr 1 is preserved by d 1 if i holds when m 1 m and m 1 d 2 m then i ii holds for all subobjects m 1 lemma 9 3 there exists a unique morphism of functors h g such that if n f m for some m and n h n g n then n v u the composed morphism of the unit and counit in h n u m v g n proof it suffices to see that the composed morphism fm v u is independent of the choice of m such that n f m so let m be another object in c 1 such that f m n we will prove that fm fm equals 0 put c 1 im g n so v u g h where h h n c 1 is surjective and g c 1 g n is injective now fg fh id since h and g are fully faithful implying that f 0 hence f g f h 0 since f is exact it follows that f c 0 and hence hom c g n hom f c n 0 therefore since c g n is injective c 0 and hence 0 we get now the functor s c 2 c 1 n 7 s n im h n g n so that s is the image functor of the morphism of functors h g h s g more precisely s is a functor and for any morphism n 1 n 2 in c 2 the morphism s n 1 s n 2 in c 1 appears in a commuting diagram h n 1 s n 1 g n 1 h n 2 s n 2 g n 2 h 1 h s g 1 g h 2 g 2 where the maps h 1 gi are surjective injective we have also the commutative diagram 9 1 1 m hf m gf m sf m let css 1 c 1 and css 2 c 2 be the additive subcategories of semi simple objects in c 1 and c 2 respectively and css str 1 css 1 cstr 1 be the category of strict semisimple objects in c 1 120 rolf ka llstro m theorem 9 4 the functor s is fully faithful and therefore defines an equivalence of categories s c 2 cstr 1 it also restricts to an equivalence of categories s css 2 c ss str 1 if n is simple then s n is also simple proof i f s n n when n c 1 since h and g are fully faithful we have f h n n f g n and combining with the diagram f h n f s n f g n one gets a natural map f s n n which is an isomorphism ii s is fully faithful consider the maps homc 1 n 1 n 2 s f homc 2 s n 1 s n 2 applying f to the diagram since f h f g we get by i that f s id homc 1 n 1 n 2 homc 1 n 1 n 2 hence s is injective to see that s is surjective letting homc 2 s n 1 s n 2 it suffices to see that s f s n 1 s n 2 equals 0 and since g 2 is injective this follows if 1 g 2 s n 1 g n 2 is 0 since f s id f f s f f f f 0 hence also f 1 0 now since f g id and f g is an adjoint pair we have homc 2 s n 1 g n 2 homc 2 s n 1 g f g n 2 homc 1 fs n 1 f g n 2 therefore 1 0 iii s f m m when m cstr 1 let k m be the kernel of m g f m applying f to these morphisms we get f 0 hence 0 since m cstr 2 hence can factorized over an injective morphism m s f m since h f m s f m is surjective it follows that is also surjective this completes the proof that s defines an equivalence c 2 cstr 1 with quasi inverse f iv to see the remaining assertion it suffices to see that if n is simple then s n is simple let 0 k s n c 0 be a short exact sequence since f is exact and f s n n is simple it follows that f k 0 or f c 0 since s n belongs to cstr 1 it follows that k 0 or c 0 therefore either k s n or c s n and hence s n is simple it is suggestive to call g and h the maximal and comaximal extensions functors of f respectively and s the minimal extension functor on certain objects all three functors agree proposition 9 5 let di be duality functors on ci i 1 2 such that fd 1 d 2 f then d 1 gd 2 h and d 1 s sd 2 for an object n in c 2 the following are equivalent 1 g n h n 2 g n s n and gd 2 n sd 2 n 3 h n s n and hd 2 n sd 2 n proof we have the sequence of functors h s g and therefore d 1 gd 2 d 1 sd 2 d 1 hd 2 since d 1 gd 2 h and d 1 hd 2 g and d 1 sd 2 also is an image functor of h g this gives d 1 sd 2 s that 1 implies 2 and 3 is evident so it suffices to prove that 2 implies 1 since d 2 s s d 1 hd 2 n d 1 g n d 1 s n s d 2 n g d 2 n d modules and finite maps 121 since d 1 hd 2 g this implies 1 9 2 holonomic minimal extensions this section is a complement to the dis cussion of the minimal extension in 9 sec 1 4 and 35 sec 3 4 where the main model of the above abstract setup is studied let u be a locally closed smooth subscheme of a smooth k schemex and j u x is inclusion morphism let hol du be the category of holonomic du modules and holu dx the category of holonomic dx modules whose support belongs to the closure u of u in x the poincare duals du and dx act on hol du and holu dx respectively we have the inverse and direct image functors detailed below j holu dx hol du m 7 j m j hol du holu dx n 7 du x du n this is done by considering open and closed embeddings separately when j is closed embedding of a smooth variety u with defining ideal iu put j m m iu m iu m 0 34 and j n dx u du n when j is an open embedding then j m is the ordinary sheaf inverse image and j m is the ordinary sheaf direct image in general j can be factorized u j 1 j 0 x j j 0 j 1 such that j 0 is the inclusion of an open subset of x and j 1 is a closed embedding then put j m j 1 j 0 m and j n j 1 j 0 n lemma 9 6 the modules j m and j m do not depend on the choice of open set lemma 9 7 the functor j is exact essentially surjective and duj dx j the functor j is a right adjoint functor and therefore j dxj du is a left adjoint functor to j proof we have j j 0 j 1 where j 0 is an open inclusion and j 1 is a closed embdding of a smooth variety firstly the restriction functor j 0 to an open subset is exact and essentially surjective since n j 0 j 0 n and j 0 n holu dx by bernstein s theorem about and the existence of b functions secondly the functor j 1 holu d hol du is an equivalence by kashiwara s theorem finally it is well known that j 1 and j 0 commute with poincare duality it is also well known that both j 0 j 0 and j 1 j 1 form adjoint pairs which implies that that j j forms an adjoint pair the fact that j j also forms an adjoint pair is a formal consequencce from the fact that dx and du are duality functors and that duj dx j putting f j g j and h j we are therefore in the situation of theo rem 9 4 and we put also j s let hol str u dx be the subcategory of holu dx consisting of modules that do not contain non zero subquotients that have support contained in the boundary u u u let holss du be the subcategory of hol du consisting of semisimple modules and hol str ss u dx holstru dx hol ss u dx the 122 rolf ka llstro m subcategory of strict semisimple modules in holu dx in this notation theo rem 9 4 implies corollary 9 8 the functor j is fully faithful and defines an equivalence of cat egories j hol du holstru dx it also restricts to an equivalence j hol ss du holss stru dx if nu is simple then j nu is simple remark 9 9 let holreg du hol du and holregu dx holu dx be the sub categories of regular holonomic modules which are preserved by the duality functors du and dx respectively then lemma 9 7 still applies to these subcategories so that in theorem 9 4 one can add the superindex reg and get another theorem e g j hol reg ss du holreg ss stru dx similarly one can replace hol du and holu dx with categories of perverse sheaves on u and u respectively resulting in an analogous result the actual evaluation of j n can be based on the observation that it is a prolongation m of n from u to x j m n such that if m 1 is any other such prolongation then supp m 1 m m u since n and j n are of finite length one gets local generators of j n from generators of n in the following way working locally near a point in u if f is a function in the ideal of u n 0 any coherent ox submodule of j n whose restriction to u generates n we have j n dxfkn 0 k 1 if n is simple a lower bound for k kan be determined from the degree of the b function of f s where is any non zero section of j n theorem 9 4 also contains the following result a coherent dx module m is pure if the dimension of the support of all its non zero coherent submodules m 1 are equal i e dim suppm dim suppm 1 corollary 9 10 let x k be a smooth variety and m be a holonomic dx module let be a generic point of the support suppm there exists a unique minimal holonomic dx submodule m m such that m m the module m is pure and m is semi simple if and only if m is semi simple we call m j mu the minimal extension of m where u is any locally closed subset of x that contains but no other generic points in suppm proof there exists an open neighbourhood u of such that mu is pure let j u x be the open inclusion then mu is semi simple if and only if j mu is semi simple since mu is pure it follows that j mu is pure and hence also its submodule j mu pure moreover if m m is any coherent dx submodule such that m m then j m u m remark 9 11 for the model h f g j j j theorem 9 4 is well known when u is quasi projective a rather involved proof is presented in 35 th 3 2 16 using a factorisation j p i g where g is a closed immersion i is open and p is a projective morphism and the functor s j is determined by i resolutions of singularities is required for the argument a point of theorem 9 4 is to show that the functor s is built into the categorical context and that the above factorisation is not required moreover as indicated in remark 9 9 one also gets analogous results in other contexts d modules and finite maps 123 there is also a point wise setup again using theorem 9 4 let be a point in the scheme x and kx its residue field let dkx be the ring of k linear differential operators on kx hol dkx the category of holonomic dkx modules let holstrict dx be the category of holonomic dx modules m such that all its coherent subquotients have support equal to the closure of then holstrict dx is a full subcategory of hol dx the following theorem which essentially is a reformulation of 35 th 3 4 2 asserts that simple holonomic dx modules are determined by their generic structure corollary 9 12 let be a point in x there exists an equivalence of categories j hol dkx hol strict dx the functor j induces a bijection between the isomorphism classes of simple holo nomic dkx modules and simple holonomic dx module whose support contains the generic point let us now consider connections on a smooth variety x i e dx modules that are coherent over ox when j x 0 x is an open immersion we know that j m is semisimple for any semisimple m knowing that m is coherent over ox outside an exceptional set we get a converse proposition 9 13 1 letm 1 andm 2 be connections on x such that j m 1 j m 2 then m 1 m 2 2 put s x j x 0 and assume that codimx s 2 let m be a coherent dx module which is torsion free along s such that j m is a semi simple module which is moreover coherent over ox 0 then m j j m and m is coherent as ox module and semi simple over dx proof 1 the assumption implies m 1 j j m 1 j j m 2 m 2 where one sees that the first and last maps are isomorphisms as follows the canon ical surjective map mi j j mi see 9 1 1 is generically an isomorphisms and the kernel is coherent over ox hence being a dx module it is also injective 2 it follows from grothendieck s finiteness theorem that j j m is coherent over ox hence we have the sequence of dx modules 0 m j j m h 1 t m 0 where t x x 0 with two terms being coherent over ox hence x being a noetherian space h 1 t m is coherent over ox and since supph 1 t m t we get h 1 t m 0 thus m j j m let x 00 x 0 be an open subset such that the inclusion map i x 00 x is affine since m is a submodule of i i m and i i m a submodule of m such that i i i m i m it follows that m i i m is a dx module which is torsion and coherent over ox and therefore m i i m 0 thus m i i m by theorem 9 10 it follows that m is semi simple if and only if i m is semi simple references 1 i martin isaacs character theory of finite groups ams chelsea publishing providence ri 2006 corrected reprint of the 1976 original
