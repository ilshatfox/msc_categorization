integration questions in separably good characteristics marion jeannin abstract let g be a reductive group over an algebraically closed field k of separably good characteristic p 0 for g under these assumptions a springer isomorphism nred g vred g always exists allowing to integrate any p nilpotent element of g into a unipotent element of g one should wonder whether such a punctual inte gration can lead to an integration of restricted p nil p subalgebras of any g we provide counter examples of the existence of such an integration in general as well as criteria to integrate some restricted p nil p subalgebras of g that are maximal in a certain sense this requires to generalise the notion of infinitesimal saturation first introduced by p deligne and to extend one of his theorem on infinitesimally saturated subgroups of g to the previously mentioned framework 1 introduction let k be an algebraically closed field and g be a k group we denote by g its lie algebra by g 0 the connected component of identity by gred the reduced part of g assume g to be a reductive group when k is of characteristic 0 the classical theory comes with the well defined exponential map which allows to integrate any nilpotent element x g into a unipotent element exp x g moreover this enables to define the baker campbell hausdorff law which is useful to endow any nilpotent lie subalgebra of g with a group law by this process the aforementioned lie algebra then becomes a unipotent group which turns out to be isomorphic to a unipotent subgroup of g to summarize when k is of characteristic 0 i any nilpotent subalgebra of g can be integrated into a unipotent smooth connected subgroup u g meaning that lie u u as lie algebras ii the exponential map induces an equivalence of categories between the category of finite dimensional nilpotent k lie algebras and the category of unipotent algebraic k groups see for example dg 70 iv 2 n 4 corollaire 4 5 if now the field k is of characteristic p 0 one should try to determine whether it is possible to define analogues of the previously mentioned tools in order to integrate p nil subalgebras of g as we will explain in section 2 2 these p nil subalgebras are the adequate objects to consider in characteristic p 0 for integration issues the first step would be to get a punctual integration 2020 mathematics subject

org msc marion jeannin that is to find a way to integrate p nilpotent elements of g into unipotent elements of g this is ensured as soon as there exists a g equivariant isomorphism of reduced schemes between the reduced nilpotent variety of g denoted by nred g and the reduced unipotent variety of g denoted by vred g such a map nred g vred g is called a springer isomorphism using mcn 05 and mt 09 a one can show that such an isomorphism always exists in separably good characteristics for g this has been observed by p sobaje in sob 15 see section 2 1 for a definition of separably good integers unfortunately this existence is not sufficient to ensure a priori that any restricted p nil p subalgebra can be integrated into a unipotent smooth connected subgroup of g if one tries to mimic the characteristic zero framework this would actually require the morphism to come with a well defined analogue of the baker campbell hausdorff law such an analogue would allow to make any p nil subalgebra into a unipotent algebraic group unfortunately the existence of such a law actually requires even stronger conditions on p let us denote by h g the coxeter number of g in ser 96 j p serre shows that when p h g the baker campbell hausdorff law is well defined nevertheless g mcninch states in mcn 02 that if p h g then any p nilpotent element has p nilpotency order 1 this allows to consider the classical exponential map truncated at the p power making use of this v balaji p deligne and a j parameswaran detail a result in bdp 17 6 that implies the existence of such an integration if p h g the authors attribute the result to j p serre see ser 96 this being established one could then expect that such an integration would induce as in the characteristic 0 framework an equivalence of categories this time between the category of p nil lie algebras and the category of unipotent algebraic groups this unfortunately can be shown to break down justifying to introduce the notion of infinitesimal saturation as defined by p deligne in del 14 and attributed to j p serre actually if p h g the exponential map induces a bijective correspondence between the restricted p nil p lie subalgebras of g and the infinitesimally saturated unipotent algebraic subgroups of g all this content is explained in more details in section 3 1 in this article we focus on integration of p nil subalgebras of g when the characteristic p is separably good for g which is a weaker assumption that the characteristic p h g condition as we will show in sections 3 and 4 the fppf formalism introduced in dg 11 a vib proposition 7 1 and remark 7 6 1 provides a way of associating a smooth connected unipotent subgroup ju g to any restricted p nil p subalgebra u g unfortunately even if this subgroup is a natural candidate to integrate u it is in general too big as one can only expect the inclusion u ju lie ju to hold true we provide in section 3 3 some counter examples to the existence of a general integration of restricted p lie algebras under the separably good characteristic assumption notwithstanding this observation and as we will show in section 5 this technique still allows us to integrate some restricted p nil p lie algebras as for example the p radicals of lie algebras whose normalisers are infinitesimally saturated for a springer isomorphism for g the notion of infinitesimal saturation here extends the notion of infinitesimal saturation when the punctual integration comes from a springer isomorphism that is not necessarily the truncated exponential map which happens for small separably good characteristics for g in section 4 we show how this extended notion together with the aforementioned fppf formalism allows us to obtain a variation when k is of separably good characteristic for g of a theorem of p deligne on the reduced part of infinitesimally saturated subgroups more precisely we show the following statement 2 integration questions in separably good characteristics theorem 1 1 let g be a reductive group over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p 0 which is assumed to be separably good for g let nred g vred g be a springer isomorphism for g and let n g be a infinitesimally saturated subgroup then i the subgroups n 0 red and radu n 0 red are normal in n moreover the quotient n n 0 red is a k group of multiplicative type ii in addition if the connected reduced subgroup n 0 red is reductive there exists in n 0 a central subscheme m of multiplicative type such that if we denote by the kernel of m 0 n 0 red n 0 then m 0 n 0 red n 0 let us stress out that even if the existence of an integration seems to be satisfied only for very specific and restrictive conditions on the restricted p nil p subalgebras this still allows to extend results classically known in characteristic zero to the characteristic p framework for instance analogues of morozov theorem can be obtained with these techniques see jea 20 this also will be developed in more details in a future article the latter states the following let g be a reductive group over a field k of characteristic 0 if u g is a nilpotent algebra which is the nilradical of its normaliser ng u this normaliser is the lie algebra of a parabolic subgroup of g obtaining analogues of this statement was the first motivation to study the questions raised in this paper section 6 then is a miscellaneous of technical results used in the proofs of several statements of this paper a subsidiary part of the content of this article comes from the author s ph d manuscript jea 20 2 context 2 1 hypotheses on the characteristic let k be a field of characteristic p 0 and g be a reductive k group we refer the reader to ste 75 for a definition and an exhaustive list of torsion characteristics for g such a notion is discussed for instance in spr 69 0 3 a summary of all the conditions on the characteristic related to the studied group can be found in the preamble of lmmt 09 or in her 13 2 we only recall here some useful facts in what follows k is assumed to be algebraically closed when g is a semisimple k group the following statement is a consequence of lmmt 09 theorem 2 2 and remark a corollary 2 1 corollary of lmmt 09 theorem 2 2 let g be a semisimple group over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p 0 which is not of torsion for g let u g be a restricted p nil p subalgebra see section 2 2 then there exists a borel subgroup b g such that u is a subalgebra of b lie b remarks 2 2 the following remarks will be of main importance in the integration process de scribed in this article i the subalgebra u is actually contained in the lie algebra of the unipotent radical of a borel subgroup b g indeed b is nothing but the semidirect sum of the lie algebra of the unipotent radical of b denoted by radu b and the lie algebra of a maximal torus of g denoted by t this last factor contains no p nilpotent element see the preamble of the subsection 2 2 whence the inclusion u radu b ii the first point of this remark actually allows to generalise the corollary to any reductive k group g for k an algebraically closed field of characteristic p 0 such that p is not a 3 marion jeannin torsion integer for g let z g be the center of g let also g g g z 0 red g be the quotient map and set u lie u as lie z 0 red g is the lie algebra of a torus it has no p nilpotent element this is detailed at the end of the proof of lemma 2 6 note that the assumption made in the statement of this lemma is not necessary to prove this specific fact thus one has u u by what precedes there exists a borel subgroup b g such that u radu b b let b 1 b be the preimage of b as radu b radu b one can always assume that u is the subalgebra of the lie algebra of the unipotent radical of a borel subgroup of b g we remind the reader of the notion of separably good characteristic as defined by j pevtsova and j stark in ps 18 definition 2 2 i when g is semisimple let gsc be the simply connected cover of g the characteristic p is separably good for g if p is good for g and if the morphism gsc g for is separable ii when g is reductive the characteristic p is separably good for g if it is separably good for the derived group g g as underlined by the two authors if p is very good for g it is also separably good nevertheless this last condition is only restrictive for type a which is the only type for which very good and separably good characteristics do not coincide 2 2 from characteristic zero to positive characteristics defining the good analogues sorites on restricted p lie algebras before going any further one needs to introduce the good analogues in characteristic p 0 for the objects involved in the characteristic zero setting this is done in this section let g be a restricted p nil p lie algebra over k in what follows we denote by p the p structure for g let us stress out that in particular the lie algebra of any k group scheme g is endowed with a such p structure see dg 70 ii 7 n 3 4 moreover for any algebraic subgroup h g the p structure on lie h h inherited from the group is compatible with the one on g in other words h is a restricted p subalgebra of g we refer the reader to sf 88 2 d finition for general theory of restricted p lie algebra let k be a field and let g be a k lie algebra as a reminder i the solvable radical or radical of g denoted by rad g is the biggest solvable ideal of g see sf 88 1 7 definition ii the nilradical of g denoted by nil g is the biggest nilpotent ideal of g in particular all its elements are ad nilpotent by a corollary of engel theorem see for example bou 71 4 n 2 corollaire 1 when k is of characteristic 0 the nilradical is nothing but the set of ad nilpotent elements of the radical of g see sf 88 1 corollary 3 10 and bou 71 5 corollaire 7 let us stress out that the equality nil g nil g 0 is not always satisfied when k is of characteristic p 0 see sf 88 p 20 for a counter example iii a subalgebra h g is nil if any element of h is ad nilpotent for the bracket on g any nil and finite dimensional k lie algebra is nilpotent one may wonder whether these classical objects inherit of a p structure compatible with the one of g lemma 2 3 let h be a restricted p lie algebra over k then rad h is a restricted p subalgebra of h 4 integration questions in separably good characteristics proof let us consider the morphism of lie algebras h h rad h according to sf 88 1 7 theorem 7 2 one has rad h rad h 0 thus the center zrad h rad h is trivial because zg rad g see for instance the first lines of the proof of lemma 2 6 by sf 88 2 3 exercise 7 the radical of h is a p lie subalgebra assume the lie algebra g derives from an affine algebraic k group let g gl v be a faithful representation of finite dimension an element x g is nilpotent or g nilpotent if lie x is a nilpotent element of gl v let us stress out that lie is still injective because the lie functor is left exact see dg 70 ii 4 1 5 on the same way an element x g is semisimple if lie x is a semisimple element of gl v these notions are independent from the choice of the faithful representation see bor 91 i 4 4 theorem let us emphasize that when k is perfect any x g has a jordan decomposition in g see for example bor 91 i 4 4 theorem more generally if g is a semisimple lie algebra over a field of characteristic 0 we do not assume here that g derives from an algebraic group any element x g has a unique jordan decomposition see for example bou 71 6 n 3 th or me 3 similarly if k is a perfect field of characteristic p 0 and g is a restricted p lie algebra such a decomposition x xs xn with xs semisimple and xn nilpotent always exists with the additional condition for the nilpotent part to be p nilpotent see sf 88 2 3 theorem 3 5 an element x g is p nilpotent if there exists an integer m n such that x p m 0 we say that m is the order of p nilpotency of x in this framework an element x g is p semisimple if x belongs to the restricted p lie algebra generated by x p finally an element x g is toral if x p x according to sf 88 2 proposition 3 3 and the remark that follows this proposition both definitions of semisimplicity are equivalent in what follows an element is thus said to be p semisimple respectively p nilpotent if it is semisimple respectively g nilpotent this equivalence of definitions is a consequence of iwasawa theorem see iwa 48 which ensures that any lie subalgebra of finite dimension over a field of characteristic p 0 has a faithful representation this result has afterwards been extended by n jacobson to the framework of finite dimensional restricted p lie algebras with the additional constraint that the involved representation is compatible with the p structure see jac 52 and sel 67 i 4 theorem i 4 2 let k be a field of characteristic p 0 let h be a restricted p algebra as previously mentioned this is in particular the case if h derives from a subgroup h g the restricted p subalgebra h is p nilpotent if there exists an integer n n such that h p n 0 when g is of finite dimension any restricted p subalgebra which is p nilpotent is also p nil that is any of its elements are p nilpotent it is worth noting that the study of ideals of g that consist only in semisimple elements can also be very instructive let us remind the following result as an illustration see bt 72 proposition 2 13 let g be the lie algebra of a reductive k group g we consider the action of g on g by conjugation let j g be an ideal which in g stable then j consists only in semisimple elements if and only if j zg let us finally underline that in positive characteristic the nilradical of a restricted p algebra is well defined but does no longer satisfy the properties it had in characteristic 0 hence the necessity of introducing the following object which appears to be under some additional hypotheses the good analogue to consider in characteristic p 0 definition 2 4 let h be a restricted p algebra the p radical of h denoted by radp h is the maximal p nilpotent p ideal of h such an object exists see for instance sf 88 2 1 corollary 1 6 5 marion jeannin let us also stress out that the lie algebra of the unipotent radical of a connected algebraic group h denoted by radu h is an ideal of nil h as u is a unipotent normal subgroup of rad h we aim to compare these different objects lemma 2 5 let h be a restricted p algebra then i the inclusions radp h nil h rad h are satisfied ii the p radical of h is a subset of the set of all p nilpotent elements of rad h iii let us denote by zh the center of h the equality radp h nil h holds true if and only if the inclusion zh radp h is satisfied where proof we show each point of the lemma separately i the inclusion radp h nil h is clear as radp h is a nil ideal of h because it is p nil hence it is a nilpotent ideal of h because the lie algebras involved here is of finite dimension the second inclusion is also direct as any nilpotent ideal is in particular solvable see for example sf 88 1 5 remark hence the first point of the lemma is shown ii this last inclusion being satisfied and radp h being p nil the restricted p ideal is necessarily contained in the set of all p nilpotent elements of rad h this ends the proof of ii iii the center of h is an abelian ideal of h it is therefore contained in the nilradical of h thus if one has the equality nil h radp h one also has the inclusion zh radp h reciprocally assume the inclusion zh radp h to be satisfied and let us show that any x nil h is p nilpotent first it is ad nilpotent according to corollary bou 71 4 n 2 corollaire 1 because the ideal nil h is nilpotent moreover as the lie algebra h is endowed with a p structure there exists an integer n such that ad x p n 0 ad x p n in other words x p n belongs to the center of h as we assumed the inclusion zh radp h to hold true the element x p n is actually p nilpotent the p radical being p nil hence there exists an integer m such that x p n p m x p n m 0 whence the p nilpotency of any element of nil h this implies that nil h is a restricted p ideal p nil of h since the nilradical of h is a restricted p ideal according to lemma sf 88 2 3 exercise 5 d this leads to the desired equality thus we have shown iii when g derives from a smooth connected algebraic k group g these objects should be com pared with the lie algebra of the radical respectively of the unipotent radical of g lemma 2 6 let k be a field of characteristic p 3 and g be a reductive k group then the equalities zg rad g nil g hold true remark 2 7 the assumption on the characteristic allows a uniform proof of the above lemma notwithstanding this point it is worth noting that the characteristic 2 case can be handled by a case by case analysis by making use of hog 82 table 1 moreover lemma 2 10 below provides the equality zg nil g in any characteristic p 0 which is a weaker result this last statement appears as a corollary of vas 05 lemma 2 1 before proving lemma 2 6 one needs to show the following lemma 2 8 let g and g be two reductive k groups and let us consider the following central exact sequence of algebraic groups 6 integration questions in separably good characteristics 1 s g g 1 let also t g be a maximal k torus and set t t s then lie g is an ideal of g and the quotient g lie g is isomorphic to t lie t as k lie algebras in particular if k is of characteristic p 0 the restricted p lie algebra g lie g is toral proof the center of a reductive group is a diagonalisable subgroup see for instance dg 11 c xxii corollaire 4 1 6 the exact sequence of the lemma being central the k group s is diag onalisable indeed any subgroup of a diagonalisable group defined over a field is diagonalisable see dg 11 b ix proposition 8 1 let e be a k torus such that s 0 e let us stress out that such an object always exists because the maximal connected subgroups of multiplicative type of a reductive group over a field are the maximal tori see corollary 4 10 consider the following commutative diagram of algebraic k groups 1 1 grm g r m 1 e g g 1 1 s 0 g g 1 1 1 where g is defined for the lower left square to be commutative it induces by derivation a commutative diagram of lie algebras 0 kr kr 0 kr g g 0 0 s g g 0 0 lie q lie i lie lie 7 marion jeannin note that the right exactness of the second line comes from the smoothness of ker see dg 70 ii 5 n 5 proposition 5 3 we show that lie g is an ideal of g let y lie g g and and pick g g let also x g be such that lie x y as lie is surjective there exists g g such that lie g g this provides the equality y g lie x lie g lie lie i x lie g lie lie i x g the lie algebra g is isomorphic to the kernel of g kr which is an ideal of g the commutativity of the diagram thus allows us to conclude that y g lie g therefore lie g is an ideal of g it remains to prove that the inclusion lie t lie g t is actually an equality this being established one will only need to apply bt 72 corollaire 2 17 to end the proof as this corollary states that t g lie g is surjective let us thus show the equality lie t lie g t it comes from the study of the right lower squares of the above commutative diagrams the morphism being surjective with toric kernel e the group t is the image of a torus t g by dg 11 b ix proposition 8 2 ii hence the equalities t t e t s hold true the following square g g g g i is commutative the image i t is thus contained in t hence the exact sequence 1 g g grm 1 i induces an exact sequence of tori 1 t t t 1 i note that the subgroup t is indeed a torus as it is diagonalisable according to dg 11 b ix proposition 8 1 smooth by bdp 17 ii 5 n 5 proposition 5 3 ii the exactness is here preserved by derivation as t is smooth let us now consider the right lower square of the above commutative diagram of lie algebras 8 integration questions in separably good characteristics 0 kr 0 kr g g 0 g g 0 lie i lie lie the kernel e being smooth the derived morphism lie is still surjective hence one still has t t kr according to what precedes any y lie g t is the image of a certain x g such that lie i x t this combined with the exactness of the following derived exact sequence 0 t t t 0 lie i allows us to conclude the exactness indeed ensures that x t moreover since one has that y lie x lie i x lie t the expected inclusion thus the equality are obtained proof of lemma 2 6 the center zg is a nilpotent ideal of g it is in therefore solvable the inclusions zg nil g rad g follow one thus only needs to show that rad g zg the involved objects being all compatible with base change we can without loss of generality assume k to be algebraically closed a d vissage argument allows to reduce ourselves to prove the statement for g connected and semisimple the reductive case can be deduced from the semisimple one while the latter is ruled by the semisimple and simply connected case i assume the k group g to be semisimple and simply connected it thus decomposes into a product of almost simple groups see tit 66 3 1 1 p 55 and one can assume without loss of generality that g is almost simple there are two options a either g is not of type g 2 when p 3 then according to his 84 haupsatz the quotient g zg is a simple g module hence the radical rad g zg is trivial b or g is a k group of type g 2 and k is of characteristic 3 according to hog 82 table 1 there are then only two possibilities for rad g it is either trivial or the lie algebra of a pgl 3 factor this last option cannot occur because the lie algebra pgl 3 is not solvable so one can conclude that rad g 0 ii assume now that g is semisimple it then admits a universal covering denoted by gsc see for example tit 66 1 1 2 theorem 1 p 43 and one can consider the following associated central extension 9 marion jeannin 1 gsc g 1 let t sc be a maximal k torus of gsc and set t t sc the corresponding lie algebras will be denoted by tsc respectively t the above lemma ensures that lie lie gsc is an ideal of g and one has the following exact sequence of restricted p lie algebras 0 lie lie gsc g g lie lie gsc 0 t lie tsc lie the extension being central the preimage of rad g is a solvable ideal of lie gsc this is a consequence of sf 88 1 5 theorem 5 1 2 hence it is contained in the radical of lie gsc zlie gsc composing with lie one can then deduce that the inclusion rad g lie lie gsc zg is satisfied whence the desired equality rad g lie lie gsc zg lie lie gsc the above exact sequence thus induces the following one 0 zg lie lie gsc rad g h 0 lie where h is a restricted p subalgebra of t lie tsc which is toral so has no p nilpotent elements in other words the p nilpotent elements of rad g are trivial hence rad g only has semisimple elements according to bt 72 proposition 2 13 it only remains to show the equality ng rad g g to get the desired inclusion rad g zg note also that all the other assumptions of the proposition are trivially satisfied as rad g is a proper ideal of g because g is a reductive k group let us thus show the equality ng rad g g according to dg 70 ii 5 n 3 2 this can be shown on k points the group g being smooth and of finite presentation and the lie algebra rad g being reduced and closed in g this is clear as rad g k is stable under conjugation the image of rad g k by g k conjugation is a solvable ideal of g k its maximality can be deduced by applying the inverse morphism iii if g is any reductive k group the following exact sequence see for example dg 11 c xxii d finition 4 3 6 allows to reduce ourselves to the preceding cases 1 z 0 g red rad g g g z 0 g red g ss 1 indeed the subgroup rad g being smooth this exact sequence induces after derivation an exact sequence of lie algebras see dg 70 5 n 5 proposition 5 3 10 integration questions in separably good characteristics 0 lie rad g g lie gss 0 lie the morphism lie is surjective its image lie rad g is therefore a solvable ideal of lie gss by what precedes it is then contained in the center of lie gss let x rad g as k may be assumed to be algebraically closed the element x admits a jordan decomposition say x xs xn with xs semisimple and xn a p nilpotent element of rad g for the existence of such see for example sf 88 2 3 theorem 3 5 as x zg one necessarily has xn 0 meaning that xn lie z 0 g red which is toral hence xn 0 so rad g only has semisimple elements according to bt 72 proposition 2 13 we just have shown that rad g zg because rad g is a proper g sub module of g remarks 2 9 it is worth mentioning the following points i lemma 2 6 in particular allows to measure the potential lack of smoothness of the center of g more precisely one has lie zg lie zg red zg lie zg red rad g lie rad g where the first isomorphism comes from remark 6 2 ii according to the proof of lemma 2 6 this quotient is a restricted toral p algebra ii a careful study of the proof shows that the only difficulty one would have when trying to extend the above result to the characteristic 2 setting relies on the fact that the g module g zg might not be simple according to his 84 haupsatz for an algebraically closed field k of characteristic 2 this is not an issue if the root system of g only has irreducible components of an type this is always satisfied in this article as mentioned in remark 2 7 the following result allows to slightly refine the hypotheses on p in the study of the nilradical of the lie algebra of a reductive group lemma 2 10 corollary of vas 05 lemma 2 1 let g be a reductive k group if k is of char acteristic 2 assume that gadks has no direct factor g 1 isomorphic to so 2 n 1 for an integer n 0 under these assumptions nil g is the center of g proof one inclusion is clear and does not require any additional assumption on the characteristic of k the center of g is a nilpotent ideal of g so it is contained in the nilradical of g to show the reverse inclusion one only needs to prove that nil g zg 0 as this implies that nil g is contained in zg which is itself a nilpotent ideal of g the equality nil g zg follows one still needs to show that nil g zg 0 the inclusion g zg lie gad is provided by the exact sequence of lie algebras of remark 6 2 ii 0 zg lie zg g end g ad assume that nil g zg 6 0 we show that this implies vas 05 lemma 2 1 to hold true leading to a contradiction as it would imply p 2 and g to be such as excluded in the assumptions we therefore have to check that 11 marion jeannin i the quotient nil g zg is a gad sub module of lie gad ii for any maximal torus tad gad the intersection nil g zg lie tad is trivial to check that condition i is satisfied we first show that nil g zg nil g zg the preimage of nil g zg is a nilpotent ideal of g as the considered extension of lie algebras 0 zg lie zg g g zg 0 is central it is thus contained in nil g zg because the quotient nil g zg is a nilpotent ideal of g zg hence we have shown the desired equality so we are reduced to show that nil g zg is a gad sub module of lie gad or in other words that ngad nil g zg gad once again as the group gad is smooth of finite presentation and g zg is reduced and closed in lie gad one only needs to check this equality on k points see dg 70 ii 5 n 3 2 remark that the quotient nil g zg k is stable for the adjoint action as the image of nil g zg k under the gad k conjugation is a nilpotent ideal of g zg k its maximality follows by considering the reverse morphism thus we have shown the equality to check that condition ii is indeed satisfied first notice that any maximal torus tad gad comes from a maximal torus t g at the lie algebras level one can summarize the situation with the following commutative diagram nil g zg 0 g zg lie gad 0 lie t zg lie tad assume that the intersection nil g zg lie tad is not trivial this in particular implies that neither is the intersection nil g zg lie t zg as any element of the first intersection occurs as an element of the image of g g zg remember that we have already shown that zg is contained in nil g according to remark 6 2 ii it is nothing but the lie algebra of zg whence the inclusion zg lie t the non triviality of the intersection nil g zg lie t zg is therefore equivalent to suppose that the inclusion zg lie t nil g is strict this leads to a contradiction indeed any element of the nilradical is ad nilpotent according to the second point of the preamble of this section and any ad nilpotent element of the lie algebra of a torus is central this can be shown as follows let n be the order of ad nilpotency of x lie t and y g passing to the algebraic closure of k if necessary the lie algebra g has a weight space decomposition for the action of the maximal torus t which is locally splittable let r be an associated root system one has g t r g thus y writes y y 0 r y for y 0 t and y g with r this 12 integration questions in separably good characteristics leads to 0 adn x y adn x y 0 r y r n x y where we have made use of the vanishing condition ad x y 0 0 as x t this equality being satisfied if and only if ad x y 0 for any r this implies that x zg remark 2 11 in this article we always assumed a minima that p is not of torsion for g this in particular implies that p is strictly greater than 2 if g has any factor of bn type the above lemma then tells us that the equality nil g zg is always satisfied in this article lemma 2 12 let u be a unipotent algebraic k group then its lie algebra u is p nil in particular the lie algebra of the unipotent radical of a smooth connected k group g is a restricted p nil p ideal of g proof as k is a field it follows from dg 70 iv 2 n 2 proposition 2 5 vi that the unipotent k group u is embeddable into the subgroup un k of upper triangular matrices of gln for a certain n n this leads to the following inclusion of restricted p lie algebras all of them coming from algebraic k group u un k note that the p structure on un k is given by taking the p power of matrices this makes un k into a restricted p nil p subalgebra so is u if now u is the unipotent radical of a smooth connected k group g its lie algebra is an ideal of g because it is the lie algebra of a normal subgroup of g as it derives from an algebraic k subgroup of g it is endowed with a p structure compatible with the p structure of g hence it is a restricted p ideal of g it is p nil by what precedes lemma 2 13 let k be a perfect field and h be a smooth connected algebraic k group then i if the reductive k group h h radu h satisfies the conditions of lemma 2 10 the lie algebra of the unipotent radical of h is the p radical of h in other words the equality radu h radp h holds true ii if k is of characteristic p 3 the p radical of h is the set of p nilpotent elements of rad h remark 2 14 in particular let k be a perfect field consider a reductive k groupg and a parabolic subgroup p g if p is such that the levi subgroup it defines satisfies the assumptions of lemma 2 10 then the lie algebra of its unipotent radical is the p radical of p lie p it is the set of p nilpotent elements of rad p as a reminder see dg 11 c proposition 1 21 ii if l p is a levi subgroup the solvable radical rad p is the semi direct product of the unipotent radical of p with the radical of l this in particular implies that lie z 0 l rad p for z 0 l being the center of l proof we show each point separately i we start by showing i an implication is clear according to lemma 2 12 the lie algebra radu h is a restricted p nil p ideal in particular the inclusion radu h radp h holds true let us show the reverse inclusion the radical of h being a smooth subgroup the following exact sequence of algebraic k groups 13 marion jeannin 1 radu h h h radu h h 1 induces an exact sequence of k lie algebras see dg 70 ii 5 n 5 proposition 5 3 0 radu h h h radu h h 0 lie this is an exact sequence of restricted p lie algebras see dg 70 ii 7 n 2 1 and n 3 4 for the compatibility with the p structure the derived morphism lie being surjective the image of nil h under lie is still an ideal it is nilpotent as lie is a morphism of restricted p lie algebras whence the inclusion lie nil h nil h as h derives from a reductive k group which does not fit into the pathological case raised by a vasiu in vas 05 lemma 2 1 lemma 2 10 applies this leads to the equality nil h zh thus one has lie nil h zh but according to lemma 2 5 i one has radp h nil h hence any x radp h is mapped to the center of zh the restricted p ideal radp h being p nil the element x is p nilpotent so is lie x as lie is compatible with the p structures on h and h in other words lie x is a p nilpotent element of zh which is according to remark 6 2 ii the lie algebra of the center of the reductive k group h this center is thus a toral restricted p subalgebra see for example dg 11 c xxii corollaire 4 1 7 hence the equality lie x 0 in other words we just have shown that x radu h whence the equality radp h radu h this concludes the proof of i ii let us then prove the second point of the statement once again an inclusion is clear the p radical radp h is a restricted p nil p ideal of h and is therefore contained in the set of all p nilpotent elements of h let us show the converse inclusion let x rad h the morphism lie being surjective the image lie x belongs to rad h which is the center of h according to lemma 2 6 which holds true as p 3 it necessarily vanishes because the center of h is toral and lie x is also a p nilpotent element in other words we have shown that x radu h which is the p radical of h according to the first point of the lemma hence any p nilpotent of rad h belongs to radp h whence the desired equality 3 springer isomorphisms and fppf formalism 3 1 integrating p nilpotent elements a starting point in what follows the field k is algebraically closed of characteristic p 0 and g is a reductive k group recall that we denote by nred g the reduced nilpotent scheme of g namely the reduced subscheme of g whose k points are the p nilpotent elements of g by vred g the reduced unipotent scheme of g namely the reduced subscheme of g whose k points are the unipotent elements of g as explained in the introduction the existence of a g equivariant isomorphism nred g 14 integration questions in separably good characteristics vred g is necessary to obtain a punctual integration when g is a simply connected k group and p is good for g t a springer establishes in spr 69 theorem 3 1 the existence of such springer isomorphisms this result has been studied and refined by many mathematicians among those p bardsley and r w richardson who extend in br 85 9 3 2 the existence of such isomorphisms to any reductive k group which satisfies the standard hypotheses as defined by j c jantsen see jan 04 definition 2 11 let us also mention here the work of s herpel who shows in her 13 the existence of springer isomorphisms for any reductive k groups in pretty good characteristic this mainly uses previous results from g mcninch and d testerman see mt 09 a theorem 3 3 let us underline that as shown by j p serre in ser 94 part ii lecture 2 theorem 3 if g is any reductive k group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p h g for h g being the coxeter number of g there exists a unique springer isomorphism exp nred g vred g this morphism is actually nothing but the classical exponential map truncated at the power p j p serre moreover shows that for any borel subgroup b g this unique springer isomorphism induces an isomorphism of algebraic groups expb radu b radu b where we denote by radu b the lie algebra of the unipotent radical of b endowed with the group structure induced by the baker campbell hausdorff law and by radu b the unipotent radical of b the reader might also be referred to a recent article of v balaji p deligne and a j parameswaran see bdp 17 6 for a detailed construction of this group isomorphism this combined with corollary 2 1 actually allows to integrate restricted p nil p lie subalgebras of g proposition 3 1 let g be a reductive k group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p h g let u g be a restricted p nil p lie subalgebra then u can be integrated into a smooth connected unipotent subgroup of g namely there exists a smooth connected unipotent subgroup u g such that lie u u as lie algebras proposition 3 2 will be useful to show the above statement in the aforementioned framework and as underlined by j p serre in ser 96 2 2 if b g is a borel subgroup the group law on radu b comes from the characteristic zero framework by lifting and specialisation more precisely if we denote i by gz a reductive z group and bz gz a borel subgroup such that g gz z k and b bz z k such groups both exist according to dg 11 c xxv corollaire 1 3 ii by gq and bq the groups obtained from gz and bz by base change from z to q then proposition 3 2 ser 96 2 2 the law making radu b into an algebraic k group comes from the one on radu b q it is defined over q extends on radu b z p and induces a group law on radu b fp then on radu b by specialisation namely the situation can be read on the following diagram the point being to obtain the dotted arrow in other words we want to show that the baker campbell hausdorff law has z p integral coefficients 15 marion jeannin b g radu b bfp gfp bz p gz p bq gq radu b fp radu b z p radu b q bz gz radu b z we refer the reader to jea 20 annexe d for a proof of proposition 3 2 stated in these terms we are now able to show proposition 3 1 proof of proposition 3 1 according to ser 94 ii lecture 2 theorem 3 when p h g the lie algebra of the unipotent radical of any borel subgroup b g is endowed with a group structure induced by the baker campbell hausdorff law which has p integral coefficients as shown for example in ser 96 2 2 propositon 1 this law being defined with iterated lie brackets it reduces to any subalgebra of radu b endowing it with a group structure as by assumption one has p h g the characteristic of k is not of torsion for g thus there exists a borel subgroup b g such that u is a lie subalgebra of radu b according to corollary 2 1 hence what precedes in particular implies that u is an algebraic group for the baker campbell hausdorff law the isomorphism of groups expb radu b radu b defined by j p serre in ser 94 part ii lecture 2 theorem 3 thus restricts to u denote by u the image of the restricted morphism it is a smooth connected unipotent subgroup of g it remains to show that lie u u the notations used here are those of dg 11 a ii d fini tion 4 6 1 let s be a scheme for any os module f denote by w f the following contravariant functor over the category of s schemes w f s s f os os where identifies with the set of f os os sections over s by dg 11 a ii lemme 4 11 7 the equality u w u is satisfied in particular one can deduce that u is smooth and connected the algebraic groups u and u being smooth the isomorphism of algebraic groups expb u induces an isomorphism lie u lie u see dg 11 a viia proposition 8 2 as u is a vector space over a field one has lie u u hence lie u u as lie algebras in other words the map expb induces the identity on tangent spaces therefore the restricted p nil p subalgebra u integrates into a smooth connected unipotent subgroup u of g remarks 3 3 the following points should help the reader to better understand the issues that are specific to the characteristic p 0 framework i what precedes ensures that when p h g any restricted p nil p subalgebra of g can be integrated into a smooth unipotent connected subgroup of g in particular under this assumption on p any restricted p nil p subalgebra of an integrable p nil subalgebra of g can be integrated this is not true in general as shown in section 3 7 see in particular remark 3 8 ii the situation might seem to be quite similar to the characteristic zero framework un fortunately and contrary to what happens in characteristic zero the adjoint representa tion is not compatible with this integration in general namely it is not always true that 16 integration questions in separably good characteristics exp t ad x ad exp tx for any x g where we denote by ad the derived representa tion lie ad nevertheless this is automatically satisfied if the adjoint representation ad is of low height according to bdp 17 4 6 the authors mention this result as a corollary of ser 03 lecture 4 theorem 5 iii let us emphasize another property that is lost from the characteristic 0 as mentioned in the introduction see dg 70 iv 2 4 5 for more details on the characteristic 0 case when k is of characteristic p h g the integration process does no longer induces an equivalence of categories between the category of restricted p nil p lie algebras and the category of smooth connected unipotent algebraic groups more precisely let u be a unipotent subgroup of g and denote by u lie u its lie algebra the field k is algebraically closed thus perfect the subgroup u is therefore k embeddable into the unipotent radical of a borel subgroup b g let logb radu b radu b be the inverse isomorphism of algebraic groups of the morphism expb see bdp 17 section 6 for an explicit construction as for expb it is induced by an isomorphism of reduced k schemes log vred g nred g in general one cannot expect the integrated group exp u to be the starting group u equivalently the equality logb u 6 u needs not being satisfied a priori for example let g sl 3 and p 3 we consider the unipotent connected smooth subgroups of g generated respectively by the matrices 1 t 00 1 0 0 0 1 and 1 t t p 0 1 0 0 0 1 as u 1 6 u 2 neces sarily the restricted p nil p algebras log u 1 and log u 2 do not coincide though the lie alge bras u 1 u 2 being the same namely it is the restricted p nil p lie algebra generated by 0 1 00 0 0 0 0 0 iv finally let us insist on the following point when p 6 h g there exists several springer isomorphisms but they all induce the same bijection between the g orbits of nred g and those of vred g as shown by j p serre in mcn 05 10 appendix when g is simple p sobaje reminds that springer isomorphisms exist if k is of separably good characteristic for g see sob 15 theorem 1 1 and remark 2 he also precises that one can always find such an isomorphism nred g vred g that restricts to an isomorphism of reduced schemes w radu b radu b radu b for any borel subgroup b g the author then stresses out that the differential of this restriction at 0 is a scalar multiple of the identity this does not depend on the considered borel subgroup more precisely the situation is the following note that the two vertical arrows are closed immersions nred vred w radu b radu b and is such that d 0 id note that the fact that the restriction maps to lie radu b 17 marion jeannin is actually a consequence of the infinitesimal saturation of the unipotent radical of borel subgroups see definition 4 1 for a definition of this notion as well as remark 4 2 for a proof of this fact p sobaje attributes the existence of such a specific springer isomorphism to g mcninch et d testerman see mt 09 b theorem e this can be generalised to any reductive k group in separably good characteristic indeed the properties required for are preserved under separable isogenies for g see her 13 corollary 5 5 and mcn 05 proposition 9 this allows us to consider semisimple groups rather than simple ones the reductive case follows because springer isomorphisms are insensitive to the center according to lemma 2 6 and remark 6 2 ii the radical of g is the lie algebra of the center of g thus is toral and does not contain any p nilpotent elements note that for p h g the baker campbell hausdorff law is no longer defined thus the aforementioned induced morphism radu b radu b is really an isomorphism of schemes and no longer of group schemes as there no longer exists appropriate group law on radu b 3 2 from lie algebras to groups a natural candidate let g be a reductive group over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p 0 which is assumed to be separably good for g let nred g vred g be a springer isomorphism for g such that for any borel subgroup b g the differential of restricted to radu b is the identity at 0 this last assumption is allowed by sob 15 theorem 1 1 and remark 2 as explained in section 3 1 it defines for any p nilpotent element of g a t power map x ga g t 7 x t let u be a restricted p nil p lie subalgebra of g the t power map then induces the following morphism u w u ga g x t 7 x t where the notations are those of dg 11 a i 4 6 see also dg 11 a ii lemme 4 11 7 denote by ju the subgroup of g generated by u as a fppf sheaf see dg 11 a vib proposition 7 1 and remark 7 6 1 this is i a connected subgroup by dg 11 a vib corollaire 7 2 1 as w u is geometrically reduced and geometrically connected ii smooth according to dg 11 a proposition 7 1 i as g is locally of finite type over the field k iii unipotent as we will see in section 4 see lemma 4 4 one thus needs to compare u with the lie algebra of ju denoted by ju we will show that when the restricted p nil p lie subalgebra u g satisfies some maximality properties as the one required in the statements of lemmas 5 1 and 5 3 it is integrable by ju before going any further let us stress out that when this integration holds true the normalisers ng ju and ng u turn out to be the same more precisely 18 integration questions in separably good characteristics lemma 3 4 the subgroup ng u normalises ju proof first notice that is g equivariant because it is a springer isomorphism so is x hence the morphism u is compatible with the g action on u in other words for any g g and any x t u ga the equality ad g u x t u ad g x t is satisfied let r be a k algebra and consider g ng u r and h ju r by definition of ju there exists an fppf covering s r such that hs u x 1 s 1 u xn sn for xi ur r s and si s but then one has ad g h s n i 1 ad gs u xi si the morphism u being compatible with the g action this can be rewritten as follows ad g h s n i 1 ad gs u xi si n i 1 u ad gs xi si ju s g r ju r where the equality ju s g r ju r follows from the fact that ju is generated by u as a fppf sheaf we thus have shown that ad g h ju r for all g ng u r in other words we have shown the inclusion ng u r ng ju r for any k algebra r yoneda s lemma then leads to the desired inclusion ng u ng ju lemma 3 5 when ju integrates u the equality ng ju ng u is satisfied proof by lemma 3 4 one only needs to show the inclusion ng ju ng u this is direct according to lemma 6 3 as the equality lie ju u is satisfied by assumption remark 3 6 the assumptions on normalisers in lemma 3 5 in particular hold true when u is a subalgebra of g made of all the p nilpotent elements of the radical of ng u this will be shown in lemma 5 1 below 3 3 obstructions to the existence of an integration for embedded restricted p nil p subalgebras 3 3 1 witt vectors and family of counter examples in what follows we make use of some general results on witt vectors to construct a family of counter examples to the existence of an integration of morphisms and restricted p nil p lie algebras in general example 3 7 let k be a perfect field of characteristic p 0 and let us consider the following commutative diagram of algebraic groups 0 ga w 2 ga 0 0 ga w 2 w 2 ga i x i xp x ga ga 0 i r i r frob where we denote by frob the absolute frobenius automorphism the central term of the lower sequence is the pushout of the morphisms i and frob the group ga being smooth the exactness of the two horizontal sequences is preserved by derivation see dg 11 a ii 5 proposition 5 3 and dg 70 ii 7 n 3 proposition 3 4 this leads to the following commutative diagram of restricted p lie algebras and p morphisms 19 marion jeannin 0 lie ga w 2 lie w 2 lie ga 0 0 lie ga w 2 lie ga 0 lie i lie r lie i lie r lie frob 0 as lie frob 0 the p morphism w 2 k is split as a p morphism let s lie ga w 2 be the resulting splitting even though lie ga and w 2 are integrable this splitting does not lift into a morphism of algebraic k groups the field k being perfect one only needs to check this on k points as the vertical morphisms induce the identity morphism on k points if the lifting s lie ga w 2 were integrable into a morphism of algebraic groups ga k w 2 k such that lie k sk the lower exact sequence of the above commutative diagram of algebraic groups would be split because the lie functor is left exact according to the previous remark on k points the following exact sequence would then also be split 0 ga k k w 2 k k 0 this leads to a contradiction because the right factor ga has p torsion while w 2 has none see for example dg 70 5 1 n 1 corollaire 1 8 3 3 2 obstructions in the reductive framework let us go back to the framework we are interested in let g be a reductive group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p 0 which is assumed to be separably good for g let u and v g be two subgroups what precedes in particular tells us that if f u lie u v lie v is a morphism of restricted p lie algebras it is not true in general that there exists a morphism of groups u v such that lie f namely the map hom g ga homp lie g k is not surjective in what follows a morphism of restricted p lie algebras is integrable if it lifts into a morphism of algebraic groups with smooth kernel remarks 3 8 one can make the following important remarks on integration of p nil subalgebras let u g be a restricted p nil p subalgebra which is integrable into a unipotent smooth connected subgroup u g example 3 7 together with lemma 3 9 also shows that not any restricted p nil p subalgebra v u of a restricted p nil p lie algebra is integrable into a smooth connected unipotent group v such that lie v v nevertheless if we require the inclusion v u to be integrable into a morphism of algebraic groups with smooth kernel then v is integrable into a smooth unipotent subgroup of u by virtue of dg 70 ii 5 proposition 5 3 hence in what follows a morphism of p lie algebras f h h is said to be integrable if there exists a morphism of algebraic groups h h with smooth kernel such that lie f let us stress out that only the restricted p subalgebras h g can pretend to derive from an algebraic group as this last property automatically implies that h is endowed with a p structure inherited from the group see for example dg 70 ii 7 n 3 proposition 3 4 moreover as underlined by the example presented in remark 3 3 iii the integration of restricted p nil p subalgebras of g does no longer induce a bijective correspondence with 20 integration questions in separably good characteristics unipotent subgroups of g this in particular implies that the integration of morphisms of restricted p lie algebras depends on the integration of the lie algebra one starts with the following lemma makes a connection between integration of morphisms and integration of subalgebras lemma 3 9 let g and h be two algebraic smooth k groups with lie algebras g lie g respectively h lie h assume that f g h is a morphism of restricted p nil p lie algebras which is integrable into a morphism of groups with smooth kernel let us denote by g h the resulting integrated morphism then f g is integrable into an algebraic smooth connected k group proof denote by v f g the image of the morphism f which is assumed to be integrable into a morphism g h with smooth kernel one can a priori only expect the inclusions f g lie g h to hold true however as k is a field and ker and g are smooth so is g as a consequence the restricted morphism f lie g lie g is surjective see dg 70 ii 5 proposition 5 3 whence the equality v lie g in particular the restricted p lie algebra v is integrable into an algebraic smooth connected k group remark 3 10 let g h be a smooth morphism of algebraic k groups assume that the derived morphism lie g h has a splitting s h g which is also a morphism of restricted p lie algebras it is worth noting that this splitting does not necessarily lift into a splitting of algebraic groups consider for instance the artin schreier covering of g g t 7 tp t its derived morphism is nothing but the identity whence it admits a splitting that does not lift to a splitting of algebraic groups 4 infinitesimal saturation and proof of theorem 1 1 in what follows g is a reductive group over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p 0 which is assumed to be separably good for g let nred g vred g be a springer isomorphism for g such that for all borel subgroup b g the differential at 0 of restricted to radu b is the identity 4 1 infinitesimal saturation the following definition extends the notion of infinitesimal saturation to the separably good characteristics definition 4 1 a subgroup g g is infinitesimally saturated if for any p nilpotent element x g lie g the t power map x ga g t 7 tx factorises through g in other words we ask for the following diagram to commute 21 marion jeannin ga g g x it follows from the definition that the group g is itself infinitesimally saturated let us stress out that there are non trivial examples of infinitesimally saturated subgroups of g namely lemma 4 2 any parabolic subgroup of g is infinitesimally saturated so are the levi subgroup and the unipotent radical of any parabolic subgroup p g proof in order to show this result we make use of the dynamic method introduced in con 14 4 and cgp 15 2 1 let t p g be respectively a maximal torus and a parabolic subgroup of g as k is a field there exists a non necessarily unique cocharacter of t denoted here by gm g such that p pg see cgp 15 proposition 2 2 9 we aim to show that for any p nilpotent element x p the image of the t power map x belongs to p pg the field k being algebraically closed this is enough to show it on k points as a reminder when p is of the form pg the k points of p are nothing but the set pg k g g k lim s 0 s g exists hence one only needs to prove that lims 0 s tx exists this can be done by making use of the g equivariance of this leads to the equality s tx s tx moreover as x pg lie pg the limit lims 0 s x exists by definition we deduce from the above equality that lims 0 s tx exists meaning that tx pg p whence the result the same reasoning as before together with cgp 15 lemma 2 1 5 allows us to show that the unipotent radical of any parabolic subgroup p g is infinitesimally saturated as radu pg k g g k lim s 0 s g 1 the levi subgroup of any parabolic subgroup p g is infinitesimally saturated as zg pg k pg pg remark 4 3 as mentioned in the preamble of section 3 1 when p h g the only springer isomorphism for g is nothing but the classical exponential map truncated at the power p in this framework being infinitesimally saturated is nothing but being exp saturated i e being infinitesimally saturated as defined by p deligne in del 14 d finition 1 5 this being introduced we can show the following lemma which states that the generated subgroup ju seems to be the good candidate to integrate u in general lemma 4 4 let u g be a restricted p nil p subalgebra then i the generated subgroup ju is unipotent ii the inclusion u lie ju ju is satisfied 22 integration questions in separably good characteristics proof the lie algebra u being a restricted p nil p subalgebra of g and p being separably good for g thus not of torsion corollary 2 1 allows to embed u into the lie algebra of the unipotent radical of a borel subgroup b g let us remind the reader of the notation introduced in section 3 2 the springer isomorphism being fixed we denote by u w u ga g x t 7 x t where x t tx is the t power map we then denote by ju the subgroup of g obtained by considering the fppf sheaf generated by the image of u what precedes in particular tells us that ju is k embeddable into the unipotent radical of a borel subgroup this is because b is infinitesimally saturated according to lemma 4 2 in other words ju is unipotent see for example dg 70 iv 2 n 2 proposition 2 5 vi we still denote by the restriction of the springer isomorphism to radu b recall that this restriction maps to radu b its differential satisfies d 0 id by assumption the subgroup ju being generated by the images of the t power maps x for all x u the lie algebra ju contains the differential at 0 of all such maps hence the expected inclusion it is worth noting that the inclusion u ju is strict in general as underlined by the following lemma which is a variation of dg 11 c vib proposition 7 6 notwithstanding this it will be shown in section 5 that ju does actually integrate u when the latter satisfies some maximality hypotheses see lemmas 5 1 and 5 3 proposition 4 5 let k be a separably closed field and let gi i 1 n and g be smooth connected k groups for any i 1 n consider a smooth morphism of k groups fi gi g then set f n i 1 fi n i 1 gi g g 1 gn 7 f 1 g 1 fn gn and for any n n 0 define fn f f n i 1 gi n g x 1 xn 7 f x 1 f xn given by taking n times the morphism f the following assertions are equivalent i there exists an integer n 1 for which the morphism fn is surjective and smooth over a non empty open subset of n i 1 gi n ii for n 1 large enough the morphism fn is surjective and separable 23 marion jeannin iii the lie algebra of g decomposes as a k vector space as follows lie g n j 1 ad hj lie fj gj where hj m k for m fi gi i 1 n the subgroup generated by the fi gi s iv the group g is generated by the images of the gj s on the big tale site remark 4 6 if the equivalent conditions of lemma 4 5 are satisfied then in particular the k group g is generated by the images of the gj s for the fppf topology proof we show i ii iv iii in order to avoid heavy notations we only focus on the case n 2 in the statement of the lemma the general proof follows by induction i ii let n 1 be an integer such that fn g 1 g 2 n g is smooth and surjective over a non empty open subset of n i 1 gi n denote by u the image of this open set under fn it is open in g as f is open one first needs to obtain the surjectivity on the whole product of m terms for m large enough remark that since we are working with algebraic groups it is enough to consider f 2 n thus m 2 n rather than fn to obtain this property this is so because the natural morphism u k u k g k is surjective as g is a k algebraic group now as being separated is nothing but being generically smooth one only needs to show that f 2 n is smooth on a dense open subset of g it suffices to show that there exists z g 1 g 2 2 n such that df 2 n z is surjective because the source and the target of f 2 n are smooth varieties see dg 70 i 4 corollaire 4 14 the map fn being smooth over a non empty open subset of g 1 g 2 n one can find an element x g 1 g 2 n such that dfn x is surjective this implies that so is df 2 n 1 x and allows to conclude that f 2 n is smooth over an open neighborhood of 1 x ii iii let n n 0 be such that the morphism fn is separable and surjective these two assumptions together ensure that there exists an element h h 1 i h 2 i ni 1 g 1 k g 2 k n such that dfn h t g 1 g 2 n h t g g is surjective for g fn h set g 1 i h 1 1 h 1 2 h 1 i and g 2 i h 2 1 h 2 2 h 2 i and consider the map g 1 g 2 n g 1 g 2 n x 1 1 x 2 n 7 h 1 1 x 1 1 h 2 nx 2 n this allows to translate fn to the origin as illustrated by the following diagram that 24 integration questions in separably good characteristics can be shown to be commutative g 1 g 2 n g 1 g 2 n g g 1 g 2 n g adn gj i fn g 1 f n where adn gj i n i 1 ad g 1 i ad g 2 i is the diagonal conjugation by the gj i s for j 1 2 and g 1 is the right multiplication this in particular implies that the differential d f n ad n gj i e t g 1 g 2 n e lie g g is surjective thus any z g occurs as d f n adn gj i e x 1 1 x 2 n n i 1 ad h 1 i x 1 i ad h 2 i x 2 i for an element x 1 1 x 2 n t g 1 g 2 n e whence the desired equality of vector spaces iii i let x g by assumption there exist natural integers n and m such that x n i 1 ad h 1 i x 1 i ad h 2 i x 2 i n i 1 ad m j 1 g 1 i 1 jg 1 i 2 j x 1 i ad m l 1 g 2 i 1 lg 2 i 2 l x 2 i where for q 1 2 the hq i s belong to f 1 g 1 k f 2 g 2 k hence decompose into products of gq ir j fr gr k for r 1 2 and j 1 m note that they may be equal to 1 the xq i f zq i s are elements of lie fq gq recall that as previously noticed in the proof of the last implication for any g g the tangent space of g at g identifies with the lie algebra of g hence the surjectivity of dfn e as for any x g the n tuple z 1 i z 2 i is an antecedent for dfn e the derived morphism dfn e being surjective and g and g 1 g 2 n being smooth the morphism fn is smooth over a non empty open subset u g 1 g 2 n according to dg 70 i 4 corollaire 4 14 it remains to show the surjectivity of fn which is direct the natural morphism u k u k g k being surjective because g is an algebraic group i iv for any k algebra r and any g g r one needs to show that there exists an tale cover s r on which g writes gs g 1 1 g 2 1 g 1 ng 2 n where g 1 i f 1 g 1 s and g 2 i f 2 g 2 s for i 1 n this is therefore actually enough to prove the statement when r is strictly henselian one thus only needs to prove it on the residue field as hensel lemma holds true allowing to lift the desired property the morphism fn is surjective and smooth over an open cover of g 1 g 2 n so its 25 marion jeannin image is a dense open subset u g hence the result as u u g is surjective iv iii by assumption there exists an integer n 1 for which the morphism fn is a cov ering see dg 11 a proposition 7 4 et proposition 7 6 hence its surjectivity any g g k 1 1 n n thus writes g n j 1 h 1 j jx 1 j h 2 j jx 2 j for hi j fi gi k with i 1 2 and xi j lie fi gi hence the map t f 1 g 1 f 2 g 2 n h t g fn h is surjective for h h 1 j h 2 j j 1 n we now run exactly the same reasoning as in the proof ii iii set g 1 i h 1 1 h 1 2 h 1 i and g 2 i h 2 1 h 2 2 h 2 i that leads to consider the map g 1 g 2 n g 1 g 2 n x 1 1 x 2 n 7 h 1 1 x 1 1 h 2 nx 2 n this allows us to translate fn to the origin as this can be read on the following diagram which is commutative g 1 g 2 n g 1 g 2 n g g 1 g 2 n g adn gj i fn g 1 f n where adn gj i n i 1 ad g 1 i ad g 2 i is the diagonal conjugation by the gj i s for j 1 2 this in particular implies that the differential d f n ad n gj i e t g 1 g 2 n e lie g g is surjective thus any z g can be rewritten as d f n adn gj i e x 1 1 x 2 n n i 1 ad h 1 i x 1 i ad h 2 i x 2 i for an element x 1 1 x 2 n t g 1 g 2 n e whence the desired equality of vector spaces remark 4 7 let g be a reductive k group of finite presentation and let h g be the k subgroup of g generated by the fi gi s as chosen in the above lemma note that h is smooth and connected because so are the gi s under some extra assumptions such as i the smoothness of all normalisers ng v of all subspaces v of g which is ensured under very strict conditions on p as described in hs 16 theorem a ii the smoothness of ng lie fi gi ni 1 the third point of the above lemma also allows to conclude that lie g is generated by the lie fi gi s as a restricted p lie algebra indeed one only needs to obtain the inclusion 26 integration questions in separably good characteristics h ng lie fi gi the fi s being morphisms of groups one actually only needs to show that fi gi ng lie fi gi under the above assumptions the proof is the same as the one in characteristic 0 that can be found for instance in bor 91 ii 7 6 the above remark provides some examples under which the lie algebra of h is the restricted p lie algebra generated by the lie algebras of the fi s the remark below however illustrates the necessity of assumptions made in proposition 4 5 by providing examples for which its conclusion does not hold true remark 4 8 let g be an algebraic group over a separably closed field k of characteristic p 0 and let fi gi g i 1 n be a family of n smooth morphisms of k groups where the g is are assumed to be smooth and connected assume that g is generated by the fi gi s in general it is not true that lie g is generated by the lie fi gi s as shown on the two examples below i assume g ga 2 set f 1 g 1 ga g x 7 x 0 f 2 g 2 ga g x 7 x xp so g f 1 g 1 f 2 g 2 note that lie f 1 g 1 lie f 2 g 2 k hence lie f 1 g 1 lie f 2 g 2 k 6 lie g ii the lie algebra of g g for g g the derived group of g does not necessarily coincide with the derived lie algebra g g for example if g slp glp glp then slp is nothing but the matrices of size p p with trace zero which does not coincide with glp glp due to the assumption on the characteristic the notion of infinitesimal saturation introduced here also allows us to extend theorems del 14 th or me 1 7 and bdp 17 theorem 2 5 to infinitesimally reductive k groups n over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p 0 which is assumed to be separably good for g this is the point of theorem 1 1 let us first remark that points i and iii of del 14 lemme 2 3 are still valid in the aforementioned framework and allow us to reduce ourselves to show the result for connected n more precisely lemma 4 9 let g be a reductive group over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p 0 which is assumed to be separably good for g and let n g be a subgroup of g the following assertions hold true i if n is infinitesimally saturated in g then so is n 0 ii if the reduced part n 0 red of n 0 and its unipotent radical radu n 0 red are normal subgroups of n 0 then they are normal in n proof see del 14 lemme 2 3 for a proof as the notion of infinitesimal saturation is nothing but a generalisation of those of infinitesimal saturation to the framework described above see remark 4 3 in what follows the infinitesimally saturated group n is therefore assumed to be connected in order to state and show the infinitesimal version of p deligne s result stated in the introduc 27 marion jeannin tion of this article see theorem 1 1 one will need a fundamental result on maximal k groups of multiplicative type which is stated and showed in section 4 2 below 4 2 a preliminary result on maximal k groups of multiplicative type corollary 4 10 corollary of cgp 15 proposition a 2 11 let k be a field and g be an affine smooth algebraic k group the maximal connected subgroups of multiplicative type of g are the maximal tori of g proof without loss of generality one can assume g to be connected as any maximal connected subgroup of g is contained in the identity component g 0 let h g be a maximal connected subgroup of multiplicative type note that as explained in the proof of bdp 17 corollaire 3 3 the connected centraliser of h in g denoted by z 0 g h is a smooth subgroup of g this is an immediate consequence of the smoothness theorem for centralisers see for example dg 70 ii 5 2 8 the group g being smooth the set of h fixed points of g for the h conjugation is smooth over k we proceed by induction on the dimension of g the case of dimension 0 being trivial if now the group g is of strictly positive dimension then i either the inclusion z 0 g h g is strict and then h is a maximal connected subgroup of z 0 g h of multiplicative type thus h is a k torus of z 0 g h hence of g by induction ii or z 0 g h g and h is central in g then by cgp 15 proposition a 2 11 applied to g one has the following exact sequence 1 gt g v 1 where v is a unipotent smooth connected group and gt is the k subgroup of g generated by the k tori of g the subgroup h g is maximal and connected of multiplicative type in g it thus fulfils the same conditions in gt the quotient g gt u is indeed unipotent thus the subgroup of multiplicative type h intersects u trivially it is therefore included in gt if v 6 1 then h is a k torus by induction otherwise one has gt g and if t is a k torus of g the subgroup h t g is connected of multiplicative type and contains h so it is equal to h as h is assumed to be maximal finally one actually has t h hence gt h so we have shown that h gt this in particular implies the smoothness of h which turns out to be a k torus 4 3 an infinitesimal version of theorem 1 1 let h n g be a maximal connected subgroup of multiplicative type of the infinitesimally saturated subgroup n the k group h is the direct product of a k torus t together with a diagonalisable k group d the latter is a product of subgroups of the form pi with i n moreover the k torus t is nothing but the intersection h nred and it is a maximal torus of n and nred according to corollary 4 10 let z z 0 nred t be the connected centraliser of t for the action of nred and set w z t this is a unipotent subgroup ofn the reasoning is the same as the one of del 14 2 5 according to dg 11 b xvii proposition 4 3 1 iv as the field k is algebraically closed one only needs to 28 integration questions in separably good characteristics show that this quotient has no subgroup of p type this is clear if such a factor would exist its inverse image in z would be an extension of p by t in nred hence of multiplicative type this is absurd as the maximal connected subgroups of multiplicative type of a smooth algebraic group over a field are the maximal tori by corollary 4 10 moreover the groups t and z being smooth so is w according to dg 70 ii 5 n 5 proposition 5 3 ii the group w is also unipotent according to what precedes the field k being perfect dg 11 b expos xvii th or me 6 1 1 holds true and implies the exactness of the following exact sequence 1 t z w 1 to summarise we have an isomorphism znred t t w let x be the reduced k subscheme of p nilpotent elements of n 0 w n 0 lie znred t lemma 4 11 the centraliser z 0 nred t is the subgroup of n generated by t and the morphism x x ga g x t 7 tx it is normalised by h proof let jx g be the subgroup of n generated by the image of x the subgroup n being infinitesimally saturated the t power map induced by maps any p nilpotent element of lie zn t to n thus x factorises through n moreover as jx is the image of a reduced k scheme it is reduced hence smooth as k is algebraically closed thus the inclusion jx nred holds true finally is g equivariant because it is a springer isomorphism this implies that the image of x commutes with any element of t we just have shown that jx znred t let also et j 0 x be the subgroup generated by t and j 0 x as a fppf sheaf it is a smooth subgroup of znred t as t z 0 nred t is smooth and j 0 x z 0 nred t by what precedes connected according to dg 11 a vib corollaire 7 2 1 the torus t being geometrically connected and geometrically reduced thus et j 0 x is actually contained in the identity component of the reduced centraliser at the lie algebras level this leads to the following inclusion lie et j 0 x lie z 0 nred t lie znred t as w is a unipotent subgroup of z 0 nred t t w the lie algebra w lie w is a restricted p nil p subalgebra of z 0 nred t hence is contained in the reduced sub scheme x the latter is the set of p nilpotent elements of lie zn t so it is contained in the set of all p nilpotent elements of g this set coincides with radp g by lemma 2 13 which holds true as either p 3 or if p 2 the conditions defined in remark 2 9 ii are satisfied as p is not of torsion for g corollary 2 1 holds true and allows to embed radp g thus x into the lie algebra of the unipotent radical of a borel subgroup b g remember that the differential at 0 of the 29 marion jeannin restriction of to this subalgebra satisfies d 0 id the group jx being generated by the image of x this property ensures that the differential at 0 of any tx for any t ga and x x belongs to jx lie jx lie jx 0 in other words one has the following inclusions w x lie j 0 x moreover the inclusion t et j 0 x induces an inclusion of lie algebras t lie t lie et j 0 x lie et j 0 x as one has znred t t w what precedes leads to the following inclusion lie z 0 nred t lie znred t lie et j 0 x thus to the equality lie z 0 nred t lie et j 0 x as the groups involved here are smooth and connected this equality of lie algebras lifts to the group level according to dg 70 ii 5 n 5 5 whence the equality z 0 nred t et j 0 x it then remains to show that et j 0 x is normalised by h recall that it is the subgroup generated by t h which is normal in h and j 0 x which is characteristic in jx see dg 70 ii 5 n 1 1 hence one only needs to show that jx ish stable first remark thatx is stabilised by h because the latter stabilises lie zn t and the p nilpotency is preserved by the adjoint action the g equivariance of thus its h equivariance then allows to conclude let r be a k algebra for any j jx r and h h r there is an fppf covering s r such that js x x 1 t 1 x xn tn where xi xr r s and si s but then one has ad h j s n i 1 ad hs x xi si n i 1 x ad hs xi si jx s g r jx r and by yoneda lemma et j 0 x is stable under the h action lemma 4 12 the restricted p lie algebra nred lie nred is an ideal of n acted on by h proof according to the proof of bdp 17 lemma 2 14 the morphism of k schemesnred h n is faithfully flat this being said n appears as the fppf sheaf generated by nred and h thus in order to show that nred is actually n stable one only needs to show that nred is h stable the torus t h nred acts on nred respectively on n leading to the following decompositions nred lie nred lie znred t x t n red and lie n lie zn t x t n where x t stands for the group of non trivial characters of t any factor in the decomposition of lie n is stable for h as t is normal in h and we need to show that so is any factor of the decomposition of nred let us first study the positive weight spaces the group n being generated as a fppf sheaf by nred and the subgroup of multiplicative type h whose lie algebra is toral the p nilpotent elements of lie n are the p nilpotent elements of lie nred this being observed as for any 6 0 the weight space n has only p nilpotent elements because we consider the action of a torus here the equality n red n nred n is satisfied whence the desired h stability it remains to show that lie znred t is h stable according to lemma 4 11 the subgroup h normalises znred t 0 thus the stability of lie znred t 0 lie znred t according to what precedes nred is stable for the action of h on n hence this subalgebra is invariant for the action of n reasoning on the r points for any k algebra r one can shows that nred is an ideal of n 30 integration questions in separably good characteristics the proof of the following lemma is the same as the proof of del 14 lemma 2 22 because relaxing the hypotheses had no consequences on the involved arguments we reproduce the proof here to ensure a consistency in notations lemma 4 13 p deligne del 14 2 22 let v be the unipotent radical of nred the action of h on lie nred nred left lie v v invariant proof the torus t acts on nred thus on v the lie algebras nred and v have a weight space decomposition for this action namely nred n 0 red x t n red and v v 0 x t v according to the proof of lemma 4 12 the decomposition of nred is h stable it remains to show that so is any v consider the following commutative diagram as a reminder as z t w and t and z are normal in nred so is the subgroup w nred moreover w is also unipotent smooth and connected so it is contained in v radu nred 1 w z tq 1 v nred q let us first study the h stability of the weight zero part of v the diagram above being cartesian one has v 0 n 0 red v z v w but w is h stable as the subgroups t and z are for z this has been shown in lemma 4 11 and the sequence is split let us now focus on the positive weights let q be the lie algebra of the reductive quotient nred v the torus t acts on this lie algebra which writes q q 0 x t q there are two possible situations either is not a weight of t on q then one has v n red whence the h stability of v or is a non trivial weight of t on q then the weight spaces q and q are of dimension 1 according to dg 11 c xix proposition 1 12 iii as p 2 because it is separably good for g the pairing q q q 0 lie tq x x 7 x x induced by the bracket on q is non degenerate see dg 11 c xxiii corollaire 6 5 thus maps to a 1 dimensional subspace h likewise the bracket on nred induces a non degenerate pairing of n red and n red and one has the following commutative diagram n red n red n 0 red q q n 0 red w tq t w denote by d the image of the pairing of n red and n red composed with the projection 31 marion jeannin n 0 red n 0 red w according to what precedes this is a line of n 0 red w the situation can be summarized in the commutative diagram below 0 v n red q hom n red d in other words one has v ker v hom n red d and v is a sub representation of the representation defined by the action of h on nred thus it is h stable combining lemmas 4 12 and 4 13 one can show an infinitesimal version of bdp 17 th or me 2 5 namely proposition 4 14 let g be a reductive group over an algebraically closed field k of character istic p 0 which is assumed to be separably good for g let nred g vred g be a springer isomorphism for g if n g is a infinitesimally saturated subgroup then i the lie algebra nred is an ideal of n ii the lie algebra of the unipotent radical of nred is an ideal of n proof the first point is provided by lemma 4 12 the second point follows from a direct appli cation of lemma 4 13 combined with bdp 17 lemma 2 14 the subgroup n being generated as an fppf sheaf by h and nred one only needs to show that radu nred is h stable this has been shown by the aforementioned lemma a reasoning on r points for any k algebra r then leads to obtain that radu nred is an ideal of n 4 4 proof of theorem 1 1 we can now prove theorem 1 1 we start by showing that nred is a normal subgroup of n the latter being generated by h and nred as an fppf sheaf one actually needs to show that nred is h stable the reasoning follows the proof of lemma 4 12 we consider the subgroup ez 0 jn generated by z 0 z 0 nred t and jn for x t recall that the jn s are themselves the subgroups generated as fppf sheaves by the image of the morphisms w n ga g x t 7 tx note that is well defined for any x t any weight space n consists in p nilpotent elements because we consider the action of a torus any weight space n is geometrically reduced and geometrically connected as it is a vector space thus the groups jn are smooth and connected this last point is ensured by dg 11 a vib corollaire 7 2 1 32 integration questions in separably good characteristics the arguments of the proof of lemma 4 11 apply and allow to show that the k subgroup ez 0 jn is contained in n this subgroup being infinitesimally saturated and even in nred as it is smooth moreover recall that p is not of torsion for g and that for any non zero weight the corresponding weight space is p nil therefore they are all embeddable into the lie algebra of the unipotent radical of a borel subgroup b g the weight spaces n are all contained in lie ez 0 jn e because the differential at 0 of the restriction of to the lie algebra of the unipotent radical of any borel subgroup is the identity the lie algebra lie z 0 also satisfies this inclusion as z 0 ez 0 jn to summarize we have shown that nred lie z 0 x t n e the groups involved here being smooth and connected the equality of lie algebras lifts to an equality of groups see dg 70 ii 5 n 5 5 hence the identity ez 0 jn n 0 red thus the problem restricts to showing the h stability of ez 0 jn by lemma 4 11 the cen traliser z 0 is h invariant so one only has to show the h stability of the jn s as h normalises t and as is g equivariant any n is h invariant hence nred is a normal subgroup of n recall that in the preamble of section 4 3 we have explained that h is actually equal to the product t d for d a k diagonalisable group to prove that n nred is of multiplicative type we show that it is isomorphic to the group d as the group h normalises nred which is normal in n the equality hnred n is satisfied as well as the following isomorphism nred h nred one has an isomorphism of fppf sheaves which turns out to be an isomorphism of algebraic groups h hred n nred d to end the proof of the first point of the theorem it remains to show that the unipotent radical of nred denoted by v is normal in n once again the fppf formalism reduces the problem to showing the h invariance of v the unipotent radical radu nred being normal in nred the reasoning follows the proof of the normality of nred in n we consider the subgroup ew j v generated by w and jv for x t as w and jv are normal in nred the subgroup ew jv is a unipotent smooth connected normal subgroup of n thus it is contained in the unipotent radical of nred moreover for any non zero weight the corresponding weight space can be embedded into the lie algebra of the unipotent radical of a borel subgroup as p is not of torsion for g and the considered weight space is p nil once again we make use of the properties of the differential of at 0 to conclude that v w x t v is contained in lie ew j v this implies the equality v ew j v for the same reasons as above this equality being satisfied the result follows from stability properties established in the proof of lemma 4 13 indeed we have shown that then w as well as any j v for non trivial are h stable combining this with the g equivariance of leads to the conclusion that v is a normal subgroup of n it remains to show the last point of theorem 1 1 which is a generalised version of del 14 theorem 1 7 iii see also bdp 17 theorem 2 5 ii a careful reading of the proof of this latter shows that it does not depend on the additional assumptions made by the author that in practice reduce the range of allowed characteristics the arguments are hence the same as the one provided by p deligne in the framework of del 14 2 25 see also bdp 17 corollary 2 15 and the proof is reproduced here only for sake of clarity the reduced part nred n is now assumed to be reductive we show that the connected component of the identitym 0 ofm ker h aut nred is the central connected subgroup of multiplicative type we are seeking it is clearly of multiplicative type as it is a closed subgroup 33 marion jeannin of h see dg 70 iv 1 corollaire 2 4 a thus we need to show that it is central and that m 0 nred n is an epimorphism the first assertion is clear as the connected group m 0 centralises nred and n is generated by h and nred as a fppf sheaf as shown previously to show that m 0 nred n is an epimorphism one proves that n is generated by m 0 and nred as a fppf sheaf we already know that n is generated by nred and h to conclude we show that m is generated by mred nred and m 0 that h is generated by m and t the assertion for m is the consequence of structural properties of groups multiplicative type the field k being algebraically closed any group of multiplicative type is diagonalisable hence m is isomorphic to a product of gm q and pi for q p 1 see the proof of dg 11 a viii proposition 2 1 its reduced component being smooth of multiplicative type the order of its torsion part is coprime with p see dg 11 a viii proposition 2 1 hence m mred is a product of groups of the form pi for i n conversely the quotient m m 0 is a product of q with p q 1 hence the result one still has to show that h is generated by m and t recall that we have shown previously that nred is stable under the action of h conjugation on n note that this action fixes t hence we have the following diagram according to dg 11 c xxiv proposition 2 11 the group nred being reductive h aut nred tad nadred the action of h on nred thus factors through tad so we have the following exact sequence 1 m h tad 1 hence h is generated as a fppf sheaf by m and tad whence by m and t as tad is a quotient of t 5 integration of some maximal p nil p subalgebras g let us start with the very specific case which has motivated our interest in the questions studied in this article assume u g to be a restricted p subalgebra which is the set of p nilpotent elements of rad ng u note that ng u is a restricted p lie algebra according to lemma 6 4 as it derives from an algebraic k group namely ng u moreover u is a restricted p nil p subalgebra of g lemma 5 1 let g be a reductive group over a field k of characteristic p 0 which is assumed to be separably good for g and let u g be a subalgebra if u is the set of p nilpotent elements 34 integration questions in separably good characteristics of the radical of its normaliser in g denoted by ng u the subalgebra u is integrable by ju proof according to lemma 4 4 there is a unipotent smooth connected subgroup ju g such that the inclusion u ju lie ju holds true moreover as according to lemma 6 3 one has ju ng ju ng ju at the lie algebra level the following inclusions are satisfied u ju lie ng ju ng ju assume the inclusion u ju to be strict then u is a proper subalgebra of its normaliser in ju this is a corollary of engel theorem see for example bou 71 4 n 1 proposition 3 in other words one has u nju u ju ng u but according to lemma 3 4 the group ju is normalised by ng u hence nju u ng u is an ideal of ng u it is a restricted p algebra as it derives from an algebraic group according to lemma 6 4 a restricted p ideal as the restriction of the p structure of ng u coincides with the one inherited from nju u and even a p nil p ideal as ju is p nil according to lemma 2 12 in particular it is a solvable ideal of ng u whence the inclusion nju u rad ng u to sum marize the set u of p nilpotent elements of rad ng u is contained in a p nil ideal of this radical namely nju u hence is equal to the latter this contradicts the strictness of the inclusion whence the equality u ju this in particular means that there exists a unipotent smooth connected subgroup ju g such that lie ju u thus u is integrable let now h g be a subalgebra and denote by u the p radical of ng h the p radical of ng h being a restricted p nil p ideal the work done in section 4 allows to associate to u a unipotent smooth connected subgroup ju g lemma 5 2 the subgroup ng h normalises ju proof one only needs to apply verbatim the proof of lemma 3 4 as by assumption u is an ideal of ng h lemma 5 3 let g be a reductive group over a field k of characteristic p 0 which is assumed to be separably good for g and let h g be a subalgebra such that the normaliser ng h is infinitesimally saturated if u radp ng h then the subalgebra u is integrable proof recall that according to lemma 4 4 one has the inclusion u ju moreover ng h being infinitesimally saturated the group ju is a subgroup of ng h at the lie algebra level this leads to the following inclusions u ju lie ng h ng h assume the inclusion u ju to be strict then u is a proper subalgebra of its normaliser in ju according to bou 71 4 n 1 proposition 3 in other words one has u nju u ju ng u ju nju h but according to lemma 5 2 the subgroup ju is normalised by ng h hence nju u ng h is an ideal of ng h the same arguments as the ones developed in the proof of lemma 5 1 allow us to show that it is a restricted p nil p ideal of ng h such that nju u rad ng h this leads to the equality nju h u as u is nothing but the set of p nilpotent elements of rad ng h this contradicts the strictness of the inclusion whence the equality u ju in particular u is integrable 35 marion jeannin remarks 5 4 let us better explicit the above condition of infinitesimal saturation with the two following remarks i in the particular case when h u namely when u radp ng u is the p radical of its normaliser in g the infinitesimal saturation assumption is superfluous as in this case the inclusion ju ng ju is clear ii the condition of infinitesimal saturation of normalisers might seem to be extremely re strictive let us stress out that there exists non trivial examples of infinitesimally satu rated normalisers any parabolic subgroup satisfies this condition according to lemma 4 2 and such subgroup appears to be the normaliser of its lie algebra moreover if p h g one can show that the normaliser for the adjoint action of g of any restricted p nil p subalgebra is exp infinitesimally saturated or infinitesimally saturated as in this framework there is no other choice for the considered springer isomorphism 6 added in proof technical results on normalisers and centralisers the formalism used in this section is developed in dg 70 ii 4 we especially refer the reader to dg 70 ii 4 3 7 for notations let a be a ring and g be an affine a group functor as a reminder i if r is an a algebra r we denote by r t the algebra of polynomials in t and by the image of t via the projection r t r t t 2 r we associate to g a functor in lie algebras denoted by lie g and which is the kernel of the following exact sequence 1 lie g r g r g r 1 p i for any y lie g r we denote by e y the image of y in g r in what follows the notation lie g r refers both to the kernel of p as well and to its image in g r the lie algebra of g is given by the k algebra lie g a and is denoted by lie g g according to dg 70 ii 4 n 4 8 proposition when g is smooth or when a is a field and g is locally of finite presentation over a the equality lie g a r lie g a a r lie g r lie gr holds true for any a algebra r these are sufficient conditions when the aforementioned equality is satisfied thea functor lie g is representable byw g where for any a module m and any a algebra r we set w m r m a r ii for any a algebra r we use the additive notation to describe the group law of lie g r iii the a group functor g acts on lie g as follows for any a algebra r the induced morphism is the following adr gr aut lie g r g 7 adr g lie g r lie g r x 7 i g xi g 1 when g is smooth in particular when lie g is representable the g action on lie g defines a linear representation g gl g see dg 70 ii 4 n 4 8 proposition centralisers 36 integration questions in separably good characteristics lemma 6 1 let a be a ring and set s spec a if g is a smooth affine s group scheme the equality lie zg h zg h is satisfied for any subspace h g proof by definition one has lie zg h g zg h a g g ad ga x x x h a the last identity can be rewritten as e ge xe ge x e g x 1 in g a whence the vanishing of the lie bracket g x which is a condition in g a this leads to the following equality lie zg h g g g x 0 x h a zg h remarks 6 2 let us emphasize some very particular behaviours of the center i let zg h red be the reduced part of the centraliser even when k is an algebraically closed field the equality lie zg h red zg h is a priori not satisfied see for example jan 04 2 3 ii let s spec a be an affine scheme and g be a s group scheme assume zg to be representable this condition is in particular satisfied when g is locally free and sepa rated see dg 70 ii 1 n 3 6 c th or me as mentioned in dg 11 a 5 3 3 the algebra lie zg lie zg a is a subalgebra of zg according to dg 11 b xii th or me 4 7 d and proposition 4 11 when g is smooth affine of connected fibers and of zero unipotent rank over s the center of g is the kernel of the adjoint representation ad g gl g under these assumptions the equality lie zg zg holds true indeed the following exact sequence of algebraic groups 1 zg g gl g ad induces by derivation an exact sequence see dg 70 ii 4 n 1 5 0 lie zg g end g ad lie ad the desired equality follows as by definition zg ker ad let us emphasise that this in particular applies to any reductive s group g and to any parabolic subgroup p g as any cartan subgroup of p is a cartan subgroup of g normalisers let s spec a be an affine scheme and g be a smooth s group scheme of finite presentation in what follows h g is a closed locally free subgroup let us stress out that under these 37 marion jeannin conditions the normaliser ng h is representable by a closed group sub functor of g according to dg 70 ii 1 n 3 th or me 3 6 b moreover if h is smooth the aforementioned theorem provides the representability of ng lie h ng h as then lie h is representable by w h which is locally free lemma 6 3 if h g is a closed subgroup then the inclusion ng h ng lie h is satisfied in particular if h is smooth this leads to the inclusion ng h r ng hr for any a algebra r proof let us remind that g acts on lie g via the adjoint representation namely for any a algebra r one has adr gr gl lie g r g 7 adr g lie g r lie g r x 7 i g xi g 1 let g ng h r g g r ad g h a r h a r see for example dg 70 ii 1 n 3 4 definition in particular for any x lie h r one has ad g x i g xi g 1 h r lie h r hence the inclusion ng h ng lie h if now h is smooth then lie h is representable by a a functor of lie algebras and one has lie h a a r lie h r lie hr hr for any a algebra r lemma 6 4 let h g be a lie subalgebra then one has lie ng h ng h proof by definition one has that lie ng h g ng h a g g ad ga x ha x h a the last relation writes ad e g e x e xe g x e x g x hr g a in g a because 2 0 in other words one has lie ng h g g x g x ha x h a g g g x ha x h a g g g x ha x h a ng h the second part of the following lemma is shown in the proof of cgp 15 proposition 3 5 7 when k is a separably closed field the study of the proof shows that one actually only needs h k to be zariski dense in h for the result to hold true let us stress out that this is especially verified when i the field k is perfect and the subgroup h is connected see bor 91 corollary 18 2 38 integration questions in separably good characteristics ii the field k is infinite and the subgroup h is reductive see bor 91 corollary 18 2 iii the subgroup h is unipotent smooth connected and split indeed under these assumptions h is isomorphic to a product of gas these conditions are especially satisfied when k is perfect and h is unipotent smooth and connected which is a special case of i lemma 6 5 let h g be a closed and smooth subgroup then i in general only the inclusion lie ng h ng h holds true ii if h k is zariski dense in h then lie ng h x g ad h x x h h h k proof the inclusion ng h ng lie h is provided by lemma 6 3 combining this together with the equality obtained in lemma 6 5 one obtains lie ng h lie ng h ng h as already mentioned the second assertion of the lemma is shown in cgp 15 proposition 3 5 7 remarks 6 6 the first point of the above lemma provides a strict inclusion of lie algebras in the general case this is actually a positive characteristic phenomenon see hum 75 10 5 corollary b and the remark that follows corollary b i when k is of characteristic 0 the aforementioned inclusion is always an equality see hum 75 13 exercise 1 ii when k is of characteristic p 0 the inclusion may be strict as shown on the following exam ple see hum 75 10 exercise 4 assume p 2 setg sl 2 and consider the borel subgroup b of upper triangular matrices the group b being parabolic it is its self normaliser in other words one has ng b b however at the lie algebra level one has lie ng b g as k is of characteristic 2 indeed sl 2 is generated by 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 and one only needs to show that the bracket of the following two matrices 0 0 1 0 and 0 1 0 0 still belongs to b one has 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 id b acknowledgements the author would like to thank philippe gille for all the fruitful discussions they had
