computational coverage of tlg nonlinearity glyn morril 1 and oriol valent n 1 1 department of computer science universitat polite cnica de catalunya november 8 2021 abstract we study nonlinear connectives exponentials in the context of type logical grammar tlg we devise four conservative extensions of the displacement calculus with brackets db db db b and db b r which contain the universal and existential exponential modalities of linear logic ll these modalities do not exhibit the same structural properties as in ll which in tlg are especially adapted for linguistic purposes the universal modality for tlg allows only the commutative and contraction rules but not weakening whereas the existential modality allows the so called intuitionistic mingle rule which derives a restricted version of weakening we provide a curry howard labelling for both exponential connectives as it turns out controlled contraction by gives a way to account for the so called parasitic gaps and controlled mingle iteration in particular iterated coordination finally the four calculi are proved to be cut free and decidability is proved for a linguistically sufficient special case of db b r and hence db b contents 1 introduction 1 2 db extended with contraction and mingle modalities 2 3 db extended with restricted modalised contraction and mingle 4 3 1 parasitic relativisation 4 3 2

logic are the so called exponentials which afford a controlled use of structural rules here we look at linguistically relevant exponentials in tlg a universal exponential without weakening in relation to parasitic gaps and a restriction of the existential exponential to mingle in relation to iterated coordination 1 a man whoi the friends of ti admire ti without praising ti b john praises likes and will love london in section 2 we define two logically simple calculi db and db with curry howard labelling and we discuss their linguistic suitability in section 3 we define linguistically refined versions db b and db b r improving the previous calculi in respect of capturing the parasicity of parasitic gaps that is that seem ingly parasitic gaps must appear in islands in section 4 we discuss

characterisation of object relativisation is obtained by assigning a relative pro noun type cn cn s n this captures the long distance character of relativisation but only allows peripheral extraction using the universal exponential we can improve the type assignment to cn cn s n which in view of the permutability of the exponential subtype also allows medial extraction various islands can inhibit or block relativisation weak islands such as subjects chomsky 1973 1 and adverbial phrases from which extraction is mildly unacceptable and strong islands such as coordinate structures ross 1967 5 and relative clauses themselves from which extraction is entirely unacceptable 17 a x b l a x b a 1 x 1 an xn a r a 1 x 1 an xn a a x b p a x b a x b p a x b a 0 x 0 an xn a 0 y 0 an y 0 b c a 0 x 0 an xn

parasitic extraction in which a relative pronoun binds more than one extraction site taraldsen 1979 7 engdahl 1983 3 sag 1983 6 there must be a host gap which is not in an island and according to the received wisdom and according with the terminology parasitic this may license a parasitic gap in any number of immediate weak islands 4 a the man whoi the friends of ti admire ti b the paper whichi john filed ti without reading ti c the paper whichi the editor of ti filed ti without reading ti in addition we observe that these parasitic gaps may in turn function as host gaps licensing further parasitic gaps in weak subislands and so on recursively 5 a man whoi the fact that the friends of ti admire ti surprises ti b man whoi the fact that the friends of ti admire ti without praising ti offends ti without surprising ti the bracket modalities of figure 3 have application to syntactical domains such as prosodic phrases and extraction islands for example walks n s for the subject condition and before 1 vp vp vp for the adverbial island constraint the relative pronoun type cn cn s n respects these island con straints because the brackets induced block association and permutation of the exponential hypothetical subtype into the bracketed domains the presence of the contraction rule potentially allows for parasitic extraction but in fact the islands in which the parasitic gaps are supposed to occur are closed off for the reasons just given furthermore the calculus as it stands overgenerates pseudo parasitic multiple extraction in which parasitic gaps do not occur in islands 6 a the slave whoi john sold ti to ti b the slave whoi john sold ti ti thus the logic of contraction as it stands precisely both undergenerates and overgenerates parasitic extrac tion we fix this in the next section using the existential exponential we can assign a coordinator type and n n n allowing iter ated coordination as in john bill mary and suzy n or and s n s n s n for john

key steps and commutative steps here we consider only the key step con cerning the existential exponential modality as usual the proof proceeds by a double induction on the size of the cut formula and the sum of the heights of the premises of the cut occurrences the so called pseudo key step of a right application of or b as left premise of cut and a contraction as right premise of cut is more involved but still standard 1 notice that crucially the b contraction must be defined for b modalized sequences as is the case in figure 6 2 the key cut steps involve the structural rules c and m the case of c is standard in the literature of linear logic we therefore omit it what is really new is the m key cut which is as follows this key step simply does not exist in the case of the calculi db b nor in db b r because there are only succedent occurrences of the existential exponential where i 1 i 2 we have that the following rule gm 17 1 a 2 a gm 1 2 a is derivable from m by application of m and the permutation and contraction steps without the use of cut then there is the key step 1 a 2 a gm 1 2 a l a b cut 1 2 b 1 a a b cut 1 b 2 a a b cut 2 b gm 1 2 b let us see now the proof that the generalized mingle rule for is cut free derivable in db using contractions and mingle if we write as 1 2 for arbitrary configurations i and we have the following mingle derivation 1 a 1 a m s 1 2 a to the end sequent s of the above derivation we apply a finite number of permutation steps and we get the provable sequent 1 1 1 2 2 2 a finally to the above sequent we apply a finite number of contraction steps obtaining 1 1 2 2 a this last sequent can be written as 1 2 a 1 recall that both and b allow only contraction no weakening nor expansion are associated to these connectives 2 the so called full lambek calculus with contraction enjoys cut elimination if the contraction rule is generalized to sequences of types hence the gm structural rule is cut free derivable in db this ends the proof idea of the cut admissi bility of the four calculi we have considered in order to prove the decidability of a linguistically sufficient special case of db b r which we call polar bracket non negative db b r we introduce two useful technical tools bracket count of a type and degree of contraction of a sequent s building upon 8 we define the bracket count of a sequent recur sively as follows 18 definition bracket count where a and b are arbitrary db b r types a 0 if a is atomic a b a b a ib a b b a b a b ka b a a b b a b ka b a a a 1 1 a a 1 a a a a where i i 1 n n 0 are db b r configurations 0 a a 1 0 a 1 n n i 1 i 1 19 definition degree of contraction we define the degree of contraction of a sequent s a dc s in terms of bracket counts as follows dc s de f a we see now some simple facts on the degree of contraction of sequents fact 1 given a derivation whose last rule is a binary or unary bracket rule with conclusions and premises si dc s dc s i fact 2 suppose that the last rule of a derivation is the contraction rule where the configuration is a bracket free configuration s 2 a cb s 1 a then we have dc s 1 dc s 2 fact 3 suppose that the last rule of a derivation is the restricted mingle rule where all type occurrences are bracket free s 2 1 a s 3 2 a mr s 1 1 2 a then we have dc s 1 dc s 2 dc s 3 finally a useful arithmetic tool is the length of an arbitrary sequent s a s the well known length of a type which is simply its number of connectives and the overloaded length of a configuration which is the sum of the lengths of all its type occurrences we define s as a we have the following theorem 20 the cut free proof search space in db b r is finite proof let lex n 2 be the total strict lexicographical order in n 2 consider a sequent s such that dc s 0 for otherwise it could not be provable we want to check its provability we can expand the current goal sequent s of the proof search space proofsearch by a finite number of goal sequents which can be either the subgoals of a logical rule or a structural rule we associate to each sequent s of proofsearch its measure s de f dc s s if we expand s with a contraction rule the degree of contraction is strictly decreased in case of a restricted mingle rule or a logical rule the degree of contraction may be decreased or remain equal in case that the degree of contraction remains equal the lengths of the premises of the applied rule are strictly decreased hence proofsearch is a finitely branched tree such that any path s i i 0 of it satisfies si 1 lex n 2 si for all i since lex n 2 is well founded every strictly decreasing sequence is finite therefore by ko nig s lemma proofsearch is finite from the preceding theorem it follows that db b r is decidable in the case that the exponential subtypes are bracket free in the sense of not containing bracket modalities within exponentials which give rise to antecedent antibracket modalities nor succedent bracket modalities we call the restriction to such types polar bracket non negative db b r whether the calculus db is decidable is an open problem however it is interesting to notice that db extended with additive connectives is undecidable in fact the lambek calculus with additives and the connective of which db with additives is a conservative extension is already undecidable this can be proved by a girard style translation between the full lambek calculus with contraction flc and the full lambek calculus with contraction flc as follows a a if a is atomic b a b a a b a b a b a b a b a b a a we can prove the following theorem 21 theorem embedding translation between flc and flc flc a iff flc a 22 corollary undecidability of flc it has been proved that flc is undecidable 2 if flc were decidable for any flc sequent a we could decide whether its translation a is provable we would have then that flc is decidable contradiction appendix mingle vs expansion consider the following structural rule called expansion for any type a 23 a b e a a b it is straightforward to see that db cut is deductively equivalent to db exp mingle cut however db cut enjoys cut elimination but db exp mingle cut does not enjoy cut
