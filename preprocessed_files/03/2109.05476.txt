proof of go del s second incom pleteness theorem for zermelo fraenkel set theory in the following form zf does not prove that zf has a model kotlarski showed that jech s proof can be adapted to peano arithmetic with the role of models being taken by complete consistent extensions in this note we take another step in the direction of re placing proof theoretic by model theoretic arguments we show without passing through the arithmetized completeness theorem that the existence of a model of pa of complexity 02 is independent of pa where a model is identified with the set of formulas with parameters which hold in the model our approach is based on a new interpretation of the provability logic of peano arithmetic where l is defined as the formalization of is true in every 02 model

note we take another step in the direction of replacing proof theoretic by model theoretic arguments taking advantage of the fact that pa has partial truth predicates for formulas of bounded complexity we show that the existence of a model of pa of complexity 02 is independent of pa theorem 10 5 where a model is identified with the set of formulas with parameters which are true in the model the presence of parameters is what makes it possible to express tarski s truth condition and do away with the arithmetized completeness theorem and any formalized notion of syntactic consistency in our approach we first define a 03 predicate modelpxq expressing the fact that x is a code for a 02 model of pa we then consider an arithmetical interpretation of modal logic where l formalizes the fact that the formula holds in every 02 model of pa the formula l is in fact provably equivalent to the 01 formalization of the provability predicate pa but since in our formalization we want to avoid the syntactic notion of provability we are not going to use this fact thus on the face of it l has complexity 04 under our interpretation of the modal operator l k says that there is a 02 model of pa and we will prove that this statement is independent of pa reasoning as follows the crucial step is to verify lo b s derivability conditions lo b 95 for our intepretation of the modal operator l i e we need to prove 1 pa pa l 2 pa l ll 3 pa lp q pl l q the modal counterparts of 1 3 form the basis of the so called provability logic sol 76 boo 94 from 1 3 and the fixed point theorem one can derive pa lpl q l whose modal counterpart is also an axiom of provability logic see for instance ver 17 under our interpretation the proof of 3 is straightforward to prove 1 and 2 we show that if x is the code of a 02 modelx and x modelpy q then we can find a model z such that for all pairs p sq we have z psq if and only if x y psq where codes a possibly non standard formula and s codes a possibly non standard number of parameters moreover and this is the most delicate part especially for the issues concerning parameters there is a function x y xy of complexity 03 which computes a code of z given x y granted 1 3 we obtain the unprovability of l k by standard methods one defines g such that pa g lg and shows that g is improvable and equivalent to l k finally we show 4 n l pa and we deduce that the negation of g is also unprovable hence l k is independent of pa this means that the existence of a model of complexity 02 is independent of pa 2 primitive recursive functions the language of pa has function symbols 0 s for zero successor addition and multiplication the axioms of pa are those of robinson s arithmetic q plus the first order induction scheme the standard model of pa is the set n of natural numbers with the usual interpretation of the symbols provability logic models within models in peano arithmetic 3 if t is a closed term of pa and m is a model of pa let tm p m be the value of t in m if n p n let n snp 0 q is the numeral for n in the standard model n the value of n is n if f n n is a primitive recursive function then using go del s function f can be represented by a 01 formula px y q of pa in such a way that forall m n p n we have 1 f pmq n pa pm nq 2 f pmq n pa pm nq 3 pa xd y px y q and similarly for n ary functions in the above situation we shall often write f pxq y as shorthand for the formula px y q given a model m of pa with our notational conventions we have f pmq n m f pmq n we recall that an element of m is standard if it is the value of some numeral i e it is of the form nm for some n p n if we identify n p n with nm p m then 1 3 say that defines an extension of f n n to a function f m m in general can be chosen to satisfy additional properties which depend on the way f is presented as a primitive recursive function consider for instance the function f pnq 2 n presented via the functional equations 20 1 and 2 n 1 2 n 2 then can be chosen in such a way that pa xp 2 x 1 2 x 2 q where 2 x is defined within pa as the unique y such that px y q with this choice of in any model m of pa the functional equation 2 x 1 2 x 2 continues to hold for non standard values of x and determines by the induction scheme of pa a unique definable extension of the function n p n 2 n p n to the non standard elements in general different presentations of the same primitive recursive function determine different extensions to the non standard elements unless pa is able to show that the two representations are equivalent a representation is natural if pa proves the validity of the same functional equations that are used in the presentation of the function in the metatheory we shall always assume that the primitive recursive functions we consider are represented in pa in a natural way given a formula pxq of pa and a primitive recursive function f we will feel free to write pf pxqq as a short hand for the formula dy pf pxq y py qq where f pxq y stands for the formula px y q that we have chosen to represent f inside pa so for instance it makes sense to write p 2 x q although the language of pa does not have a symbol for the exponential function using similar conventions we may act as if the language of pa had been enriched with a symbol for each primitive recursive function or more precisely for each primitive recursive presentation of a function we fix an effective go del numbering of terms and formula of pa and we write x y p n for the go del number of we then define p q with slightly bigger corners as the numeral of the go del number of so by definition p q x y in the next section we will introduce various primitive recursive functions involved in the formalization of syntactic notion we use x 0 x 1 x 2 as formal variables of pa but we also use other letters such as x y z t as metavariables standing for formal variables 3 arithmetization the content of this section is entirely standard but we include it to fix the nota tions 4 alessandro berarducci and marcello mamino proposition 3 1 there are primitive recursive functions succ plus times var such that succpxtyq xsptqy pluspxt 1 y xt 2 yq xt 1 t 2 y timespxt 1 y xt 2 yq xt 1 t 2 y varpiq xxi y where t t 1 t 2 are terms and i p n the above functions can be naturally represented in pa by 01 formulas so they have a natural extension denoted by the same names to non standard models of pa by formalizing the recursive definition of the class of terms inside pa we obtain proposition 3 2 there is a formula tmpxq p 01 such that pa proves that for all x tmpxq holds if and only if one and only one of the following alternatives holds di x varpiq x p 0 q da tmpaq x succpaq da b tmpaq tmpbq x pluspa bq da b tmpaq tmpbq x timespa bq since the class of codes of terms is a primitive recursive under the natural formal ization both tmpxq and its negation are equivalent in pa to 01 formulas corollary 3 3 for every term t of pa pa tmpptqq we have analogous propositions for the codes of formulas proposition 3 4 there are primitive recursive functionsnot and exists equals such that notpx yq x y andpx y x yq x y existspi x yq xdxi y equalspxt 1 y xt 2 yq xt 1 t 2 y where are formulas t 1 t 2 are terms and i p n the above functions can be naturally represented in pa by 01 formulas so they have a natural extension denoted by the same names to non standard models of pa proposition 3 5 there is a formula fmpxq p 01 such that pa proves that for all x fmpxq holds if and only if one and only one of the following alternatives holds da b tmpaq tmpbq x equalspa bq d fmp q x notp q d fmp q fmp q x andp q di fmp q x existspi q since the class of codes of formulas is primitive recursive under the natural formal ization both fmpxq and its negation are equivalent in pa to 01 formulas corollary 3 6 for every formula pa fmpp qq provability logic models within models in peano arithmetic 5 definition 3 7 if m is a model of pa and p m is such that m fmp q we will say that is an arithmetized formula in the model m similarly an arithmetized term of m is an element a p m such that m tmpaq if is a formula of pa in the metatheory then p qm is an arithmetized formula of m but if m is non standard there are arithmetized formulas which are not of this form similarly if t is a term of pa then ptqm is a arithmetized term of m and if m is non standard it will also contain non standard arithmetized terms 4 02 models in this section we define a 02 model as a modelm with domain n such that the set of formulas with parameters which are true in the model is 02 definable we proceed below with the formal definitions an infinite sequence of natural numbers panqn is finitely supported if there is k p n such that an 0 for all n k there is a bijection between natural numbers and finitely supported sequences of natural numbers it suffices to map s p n to the sequence of the exponents appearing in the prime factorization kp ak k of s 1 where p 0 2 p 1 3 p 2 5 and in general pk is the k 1 th prime definition 4 1 pa given s k let elps kq be the least k such that pk 1 i does not divide s 1 note elps kq 0 for all sufficiently large values of k according to the definitions s 1 kp elps kq k where kp elps kq k can be regarded as a finite product since all but finitely many factors are equal to 1 definition 4 2 pa given s a k we write sra ks for the unique t such that elpt iq elps iq for all i k and elpt kq a we will consider countable models m of pa we can assume that all such models have domain n but the intepretation of the function symbols 0 s will in general differ from the standard one definition 4 3 let m pn 0 m sm m mq be a model of pa with domain n if is a formula in the language of pa and s p n we write m psq to express the fact that holds in m in the environment coded by s that is to say the environment which for each i assigns the value elps iq to the variable xi for simplicity we take as a basis of logical connectives d negation conjunction existential quantification the universal quantifier and the logical connectives and are defined in terms of d in the usual way tarski s truth conditions then take the following form m pdxi qpsq there is a p n such that m psra isq m p qpsq m psq and m psq m p qpsq m psq m pt 1 t 2 qpsq valpt 1 m sq valpt 2 m sq where valpt m sq is the value of the term t in the model m when variables are evaluated according to s namely valpxi m sq elps iq 6 alessandro berarducci and marcello mamino if is closed it has no free variables then the validity of a formula in m does not depend on the environement m psq m p 0 q in this case we may write m for m p 0 q occasionally we make use of the connective k standing for false thus for every m we have m k definition 4 4 let m be a model of pa with domain n we say that m is a 02 model if the set of pairs px y sq p n n such that m psq is an arithmetical set of complexity 02 we recall that a set of natural numbers is 02 if both the set and its complement can be defined by a 02 formula notice that a 0 2 model is in fact automatically 0 2 the following proposition follows from the well known fact that a recursive binary tree with an infinite path has a 02 infinite path fact 4 5 kle 52 thm 38 let t be a recursively axiomatized theory in the language of pa then t has a model if and only if t has a 02 model the above fact is sometimes stated in a sligthly different form a consistent recur sively axiomatized theory has a consistent completion of complexity 02 but one can easily deduce the form given above see sho 60 for related results and pointers to the relevant literature 5 codes of models in this section we define the notion of 02 model and show that the set of codes of 02 models is 0 3 definable proposition 5 7 this is related to the observation in kot 04 that the set of codes of consistent complete extensions of a recursively axiomatized theory is 03 definable the difference is that our formulation does not involve the syntactic notion of consistency which would require fixing a proof system we need the fact that in pa there are 0 n truth predicates for 0 n formulas see hp 93 in particular we have fact 5 1 there is a formula sat 2 px 0 x 1 q p 0 2 such that for every px 1 q p 0 2 pa x 1 sat 2 pp q x 1 q px 1 q for our purposes we need a variation of sat 2 which works for formulas in two variables and additional parameters as in the following corollary the corollary 5 2 there is a formula satpx 0 x 1 x 2 q p 0 2 such that for every n p n and every formula pz 1 zn x y q p 0 2 pa a 1 an dc x y satpc x y q pa 1 an x y q the idea is that c codes the predicate tpx y q pa 1 an x y qu proof we make use of the predicate sat 2 of fact 5 1 and of the coding of sequences in definition 4 1 for simplicity we write psqi for elps iq let satpc x y q be the formula sat 0 ppcq 0 f pc x y qq where f pc x y q is the least t such that ptq 0 x ptq 1 y i 0 ptqi 1 pcqi provability logic models within models in peano arithmetic 7 now given there is a 02 formula ptq such that in pa ptq pptq 2 ptqn 1 ptq 0 ptq 1 q reasoning in pa given a 1 an let c be minimal such that pcq 0 x y pcq 1 a 1 pcqn an then satpc x y q sat 2 pp q f pc x y qq pf pc x y qq pa 1 an x y q definition 5 3 let m be a 02 model of pa definition 4 4 then by definition there is a 02 formula mpx 0 x 1 q such that for all formulas of pa and all s p n m psq n mpp q sq letting m x my this is equivalent to m psq n satpm p q sq where n is the standard model of pa if the above equivalence holds for all p sq we say that m is a code for the model m our next goal is to show that the set of codes of 02 models is 0 3 definable we want to do so avoiding any recourse to a proof system definition 5 4 we write y for the unique y such that when we write an expres sion like f pxq y p px y q we mean that f is the partial function defined as follows if there is one and only one y such that p px y q then f pxq is such a y in the opposite case f pxq is undefined definition 5 5 pa given m we define partial functions 0 m sm m m of arity 0 1 2 2 respectively as follows 0 m y satpm p 0 x 0 q sry 0 sq smpaq y satpm pspx 0 q x 1 q sra 0 y 1 sq a m b y satpm px 0 x 1 x 2 q sra 0 b 1 y 2 sq a m b y satpm px 0 x 1 x 2 q sra 0 b 1 y 2 sq we say that m is total if these functions are total i e the various y always exist and are unique since sat is 02 m is total is a 0 3 definable predicate in m if m is total we define a function val whose first argument satisfies the predicate tmpxq as follows valpvarpiq m sq elps iq valpp 0 q m sq 0 m valpsuccpaq m sq smpvalpa m sqq valppluspa bq m sq valpa m sq m valpb m sq valptimespa bq m sq valpa m sq m valpb m sq note that val is 03 definable definition 5 6 pa we write x psq for satpm sq we write modelpmq if m is total definition 5 5 and the conjunction of the universal closure of the following clauses holds where the variables are relativized to the predicate fm the variables a b are relativized to the predicate tm and the variables i s are unrestricted 8 alessandro berarducci and marcello mamino m existspi qpsq da m psra isq m andp qpsq m psq m psq m notp qpsq pm psqq m equalspa bqpsq valpa m sq valpb m sq axpap q m psq proposition 5 7 1 modelpmq is a 03 formula in the free variable m 2 if m is a 02 model of pa and m is a code for m definition 5 3 then n modelpmq 3 if m p n and n modelpmq then there is a 02 model m such that m psq n satpm p q sq for all s if 3 holds m is the unique model coded by m so every 02 model has a code but different codes may code the same model proof point 1 is by inspection of the definition of modelpxq indeed we have already observed that the totality condition in definition 5 5 is 03 it is also clear that the negative occurrence of the subformula da m psra isq in definition 5 6 is 03 and the other parts in the definition of modelpxq have lower complexity to prove 2 we recall that by its very definition modelpmq expresses the fact that the set tp sq m psqu satisfies tarski s truth conditions for arithmetized formulas standard or non standard when interpreted in the standard model n we only need to consider standard arithmetized formulas and 2 follows from the assumption that m is a model to prove 3 let m p n be such that n modelpmq define m as the structure with domain n which interprets 0 s as 0 m sm m m respectively by induction on the complexity of the formula we havem psq n satpm p q sq 6 an anti quote notation definition 6 1 if is a formula without free variables we write truepx p qq for satpx p q 0 q and observe that pa modelpmq sptruepm p qq satpm p q sqq i e pa proves that the truth of a closed formula in a model does not depend on the environment definition 6 2 if px 0 xnq is a formula of pa we write truepm p p 9 a 0 9 anqq for ds i n elps iq ai satpm p px 0 xnqq sq if modelpmq holds satpm p p 9 a 0 9 anqqq formalizes the fact that holds in the model coded by m in the environment which assigns the value ai to the variable xi intuitively pq is a quote notation and the dot is an anti quote if an expression appears within the scope of pq it is only its name that matters not its value but if we put a dot on it it is its value that matters and not its name the following remark will further clarify the issue provability logic models within models in peano arithmetic 9 remark 6 3 assume modelpmq if f is a primitive recursive function there is a difference between truepm p p f pxqqqq and truepm p pf p xqqqq in the first case we evaluate f pxq outside of m and we intepret px 0 q in m in the environment x 0 f pxq in the second case we interpret the formula pf px 0 qq in m in the environment x 0 x more precisely pa proves that if modelpmq holds then truepm p p f pxqqqq dspelps 0 q f pxq satpm p px 0 qq sqq truepm p pf p xqqqq dtpelpt 0 q x satpm p pf px 0 qqq tqq 7 coding environments given a finite sequence a 0 an p n there is some s p n which codes the given sequence in the sense that elps kq ak for all k 0 n now let m be a model of pa with domain n we may then consider a 0 an as a sequence of elements of m and as such it will be coded in m by some t which in general will be different from both s and sm note that in m the element sm will code the sequence a 0 m an m which in general is different from a 0 an the aim of this section is to construct a function which given m and s produces such an element t in fact we will produce a 03 definable function env such that given s and a code m for a 02 model m yields an element t envps mq as above recalling the substitution function srz ks from definition 4 2 the crucial property of env will be that it commutes with subtitutions in the sense that if m codes a 02 model m then for all s z k we have m x 0 rx 1 ks x 2 in the environment x 0 envps mq x 1 z x 2 srz ks this will be formalized by the following proposition where numvpk mq is an auxiliary function to be defined later it represents the value of the possibly non standard numeral corresponding to k in the model coded by m proposition 7 1 pa x z k s pmodelpmq truepm p envps mqr z numvpk mqs envpsrz ks mqqqq in the rest of the section we construct the functions env and numv and we prove the proposition before reading further the reader may take a look at proposition 8 1 and the comments preceeding it to see how the functions env and numv will be used essentially they are needed to formalize y psq inside another model env will be applied to the environment s and numv will be applied to the arithmetized formula definition 7 2 let num n n be the primitive recursive function n xsnp 0 qy we can represent num inside pa so it will make sense to apply it to non standard elements of a model of pa definition 7 3 pa assuming modelpmq let numvpn mq valpnumpnq m 0 q the third argument of val codes the environment which is irrelevant in this case if n is standard then numvpn mq is the value of the numeral n in the model coded by m lemma 7 4 let m be a model of pa with domain n given s n p n there is a unique t such that 10 alessandro berarducci and marcello mamino 1 k n a n elps kq a m elpt kq a 1 2 m k n elpt kq 0 now let n be such that elps kq 0 for all k n and let t satisfy 1 and 2 for this n then 3 k a n elps kq a m elpt kq a note that the conjuntion of 1 and 2 is stronger than 3 as 2 also implies that m elpt kq 0 for all non standard k proof by induction on n for n 0 we take t 0 the general case follows from the fact that pa is a sequential theory and m is a model of pa by formalizing the proof of lemma 7 4 in pa we obtain the following result lemma 7 5 pa let m be such that modelpmq given s n there is a unique t such that 1 k n truepm pelp t numvpk mqq elps kqqq 2 truepm p k numvpn mq elp t kq 0 qq now let n be such that k n elps kq 0 and define envps mq as the unique t such that 1 and 2 hold for this n the same t will work for all larger n then 3 k truepm pelp envps mq numvpk mqq elps kqqq recalling that s 1 ip elps iq i we can illustrate the definition of env by the following example example 7 6 let s 1 2735 and let m be a 02 model coded by m then envps mq is the unique element t such that m x 2 1 2 x 03 x 1 in the environment x 0 7 x 1 5 x 2 t note that 7 and 5 are not necessarily equal to 5 m and 7 m so in general m x 0 1 2 537 in the environment x 0 t we are now ready to prove proposition 7 1 proof of proposition 7 1 the proposition says that the formula m z k s pmodelpmq truepm p envps mqr z numvpk mqs envpsrz ks mqqqq is provable in pa to begin with notice that pa proves that if two sequences coded by u and v co incide namely k elpu kq elpv kq then u v since pa proves that modelpmq implies truepm q for all codes of consequences of pa it suffices to prove that assuming modelpmq truepm p x 0 elp envps mqr z numvpk mqs x 0 q elp envpsrz ks mq x 0 qqq by the definition of modelpmq this holds if and only if t truepm pelp envps mqr z numvpk mqs tq elp envpsrz ks mq tqqq now fix n such that for all i n elps iq 0 then if truepm p t numvpn mqqq there is t 1 such that truepm p t numvpt 1 mqqq this formalizes the fact that a number less than a standard number is standard and we get by 1 in proposi tion 7 5 in the subcase t numvpk mq we get truepm p z zqq if truepm p t numvpn mqqq then follows directly from 2 in the same proposition 1 here m elpt kq a means that m satisfies elpx 0 kq x 1 in the environment x 0 t x 1 a provability logic models within models in peano arithmetic 11 8 a model within a model in this section we show that if x is the code of a 02 model x and x modelpy q then we can find a model z such that z psq if and only if x y psq moreover there is a definable function which computes a code xy of z given x y proposition 8 1 pa given x y there is z such that for all s satpz sq truepx psatp y numvp xq envps xqqqq we define xy as the minimal such z and observe that the function x y xy is 03 definable proof given x y the set tp sq truepx psatp y numvp xq envps xqqqqu is 02 definable with parameters x y so by corollary 5 2 there is some z which codes this set and we take xy to be the minimal such z it can be readily verified that x y xy is 03 definable theorem 8 2 pa if modelpxq and truepx xmodelp y qyq then modelpxy q proof we need to check that the class of all pairs p sq such that satpxy sq satisfies tarski s truth conditions and contains the arithmetized axioms of pa the latter property is easy so we limit ourself to verify the clauses for and d in tarski s truth conditions satpxy notp q sq truepx psatp y numvpnotp q xq envps xqqqq truepx p satp y numvp q envps xqqqq truepx psatp y numvp q envps xqqqq satpxy sq where in the second equivalence we used the fact that truepx modelp y qq and in the third we used the hypothesis modelpxq similarly we have satpxy existspk q sq truepx psatp y numvpexistspk q xq envps xqqqq truepx pdx 0 satp y numvp xq envps xqrx 0 numvpk xqsqqq dz truepx psatp y numvp xq envps xqr z numvpk xqsqqq dz truepx psatp y numvp xq envpsrz ks xqqqq dz satpxy srz ksq where the fourth equivalence makes use of the properties of env proposition 7 1 9 lo b s derivability conditions

this is equivalent to n and the claim is thus proved claim 2 n l pa note that pa if and only if pa has a model satisfying this happens if and only if n which is equivalent to n l whence the claim claim 3 pa we recall that says that there exist x y satisfying modelpxq truepx pmodelp y qqq and truepx ptruep y p qqqq hold on the other hand says that there is z such that modelpzq and truepz p qq hold to prove the implication one can take z xy as defined in proposition 8 1 claim 4 pa l ll immediate from claim 3 and the equivalence pa l claim 5 if pa then pa l since n pa by claim 4 n l ll by

formula by the diagonal lemma given a formula pxq in one free variable there is a closed formula such that pa pp qq using the diagonal lemma we can define a formula g which says i have no 02 model as in the definition below definition 10 1 let g be such that pa g lg using theorem 9 2 we deduce that g is undecidable and equivalent to l k by the standard arguments see for instance boo 94 we give the details below lemma 10 2 pa g proof suppose pa g then pa lg theorem 9 2 1 on the other hand by definition of g pa lg contradicting the consistency of pa provability logic models within models in peano arithmetic 13 lemma 10 3 pa g l k proof we use 1 3 in theorem 9 2 reason in pa if g holds we get lg by definition of g since k g is a tautology we obtain l k lg hence l k now assume g by definition of g we get lg and by theorem 9 2 2 llg follows moreover we have lplg gq apply the definition of g inside the l so we get l g since we also have lg we obtain l k lemma 10 4 pa g proof suppose pa g then by definition of g pa lg so n lg and by theorem 9 2 4 pa g contradicting the consistency of pa we have thus obtained theorem 10 5 l k is independent of pa namely pa does not prove that pa has a 02
