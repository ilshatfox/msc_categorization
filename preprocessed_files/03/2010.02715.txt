learning x ray ct cnn 2 abstract the recent outbreak of sars cov 2 gave us a unique opportunity to study for a non interventional and sustainable ai solution lung disease remains a major healthcare challenge with high morbidity and mortality worldwide the predominant lung disease was lung cancer until recently the world has witnessed the global pandemic of covid 19 the novel coronavirus outbreak we have experienced how viral infection of lung and heart claimed thousands of lives worldwide with the unprecedented advancement of artificial intelligence in recent years machine learning can be used to easily detect and classify medical imagery it is much faster and most of the time more accurate than human radiologists once implemented it is more cost effective and time saving in our study we evaluated the efficacy of microsoft cognitive service to detect and classify covid 19 induced pneumonia from other viral bacterial pneumonia based on x ray and ct images we wanted to assess the implication and accuracy of the automated ml based rapid application development rad environment in the field of medical image diagnosis this study will better equip us to respond with an ml based diagnostic decision support system dss for a pandemic situation like covid 19 after optimization the trained network achieved 96 8 average precision which was implemented as a web application for consumption however the same trained network did not perform the same like web application when ported to smartphone for real time inference which was our main interest of study the authors believe there is scope for further study on this issue one of the main goal of this study was to develop and evaluate the performance of ai powered smartphone based real time application facilitating primary diagnostic services in less equipped and understaffed rural healthcare centers of the world with unreliable internet service 1 introduction in recent years the availability of machine learning algorithms made available as service has transformed our ability to add ai features to applications expertise that was once the realm of hardcore ai experts can now be accessed by a much wider range of developers armed with a cloud subscription machine learning was once a domain of data scientists from 2016 we saw the development of simplified models that gave developers liberty and the ability to create sophisticated machine learning models with minimum effort and knowledge this wizard like graphical development environment gave non data scientists to get their hands into experimenting with ml models armed with a limited amount of data and transfer learning technology people with no background in data science can construct sophisticated industry standard production ready ai models with the rapid application development rad method it giants came forward to the advent of this platform microsoft introduced custom vision 1 google introduced auto ml 2 and apple introduced create ml 3 to democratize machine learning in our experiment we used custom vision microsoft cognitive services are part of the microsoft azure cloud solution this machine learning tool enables developers to import their images and create computer vision in microsoft azure custom vision 1 custom vision is built on a pre trained convolutional neural network cnn and facilitates users with a training technique called transfer 3 learning it enables the creation of ai models using the custom vision web application by simply uploading the training images and tagging them into a model builder due to transfer learning technology that starts with a pre trained model and uses this model as a feature extractor custom vision does not require as many images for training and testing as regular convolutional neural network cnn a minimum requirement of 50 images per tag is recommended it also runs fast even on less powerful computers as the training is done in the cloud models can be created in custom vision and run as a web application through a rest api there is sample code documentation for curl c java javascript objc php python ruby in microsoft custom vision documentation site 4 custom vision is the state of the art machine learning technology that supports to export its trained model into tensorflow tensorflowlite tensorflowjs coreml onnx dockerfile and vaidk format thus creating an opportunity to use it effortlessly in many platforms currently custom vision supports image classification and object detection in image classification it has two subclasses 1 multilabel multiple tags per image 2 multiclass single tag per image in four different domains these domains are pre trained so it can be effectively trained with few image samples compact domains of the custom vision models can be transferred to mobile and edge devices to do real time on device inference there are two ways to create a custom vision project visually and programmatically for this project we have chosen the graphical development environment for the sake of rapid application development anyone can use c or python for the same purpose the codebase is available in the custom vision documentation site objective the purpose of our study was to evaluate microsoft cognitive service to detect covid 19 induced pneumonia and ordinary viral or bacterial infection in lung using x ray and ct scan images we have used datasets from a recognized and trusted source to build our model the primary objective is a smartphone based on device real time inference system in this case the model would run by a mobile device s system on chip soc and will not require an internet connection for inference with zero latency this system would be particularly suitable for rural areas of developing countries where internet connection is poor or not available the secondary solution would be a web portal running the inference through rest api from custom vision now given the nature of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 which causes respiratory disease as a novel one the majority of the radiologists are not acquainted enough to detect the virus related changes from the x ray moreover the morphology of covid 19 and common pneumonia are hard to differentiate from x ray alone without the patient s symptoms by a radiologist 4 here ai comes into play with the role of an expert assistant it is much faster and efficient to train a machine over thousands of labeled training data to observe and detect subtle differences between various x ray images to train its artificial neural network and classify them quickly which is otherwise not possible by a human eye a radiologist can use the app to primarily identify the x ray in question and combine it with his her medical expertise along with the patient s case history before in conjunction with tests like rt pcr antibody 2 resources and methodology 2 1 data collection and preparation we have collected datasets of covid 19 affected lung x ray images 5 normal and other viruses bacteria induced pneumonic lung x ray images 6 covid 19 ct scan and normal ct scan images 7 household objects dataset 8 labeled as inapplicable in the model from authenticated trusted and well curated sources most of the chest radiograph images cxr is available in the poster anterior views pa this is a standard chest radiograph referring to the direction of x ray beam travel it is frequently used to aid the diagnosis of acute and chronic conditions in the lungs a statistics of datasets acquired are given in the table below dataset name train data test data validation data covid 19 x ray 295 nil 25 normal x ray 1341 234 8 pneumonia x ray 3875 390 8 normal ct 397 nil nil covid 19 ct 349 nil nil household objects 185 123 nil table 1 dataset info used in the model microsoft cognitive service recommends using at least 50 images of each class to get a better prediction result it is also recommended that images of all classes should be equal or close to equal for a better performing model dissimilarity in image count results in inclined or declined to a particular class while inferring as it is seen from the table above the lowest image count dataset is the covid 19 x ray in terms of medical imagery so despite we have more images in other classes using an image count of more than 295 will result in an imbalanced model in our experiment we will see the impact of imbalanced image counts in the model and how does it behave in the real world 5 microsoft custom vision doesn t require test data to be supplied separately for performance scoring rather it automatically assigns test data from the supplied data for training so in our experiment we used test data for manual performance evaluation since those test data are unknown to the model 2 2 data loading and model building to use the microsoft cognitive service we need to create custom vision training and prediction resources in azure to do so in the azure portal we filled out the dialog window on the create custom vision page to create both training and prediction resources we used the same credential to log into the custom vision site login with the same credential to both azure and custom vision is important as otherwise it will not be possible to publish the trained model for inference with rest api we ran 7 iterations of training in total with different combinations of data and classes here in custom vision images are clustered by tags the table below shows 7 different iteration results in a combination of different image counts and tags iterations tag name precision recall average precision image count iteration 7 published inapplicable 100 0 100 0 100 0 275 pneumonia 98 1 92 7 96 8 275 covid 19 96 5 100 0 100 0

general and compact compact domain lets users download model to be used in real time in mobile and edge devices also there are two categories of training quick and advanced advanced training trains model to detect images with a challenging and fine grained dataset with poor augmentation setting for our study we used advanced training and compact domain from iteration 1 to iteration 6 iteration 7 is trained in the general domain with advanced training 2 3 iteration 1 in this iteration we trained the microsoft custom vision model to detect covid 19 positive and covid 19 negative from training dataset x ray images we created two classes of images 25 images each with the following labels covid 19 positive and covid 19 negative for the covid 19 positive label we used chest x ray images of covid 19 positive patients and for the covid 19 negative label we used chest x ray images of normal healthy persons as it is seen from table 2 it scored 100 in all three categories of performance measure however small sample dataset and with only two labels it is impractical to use in real life 2 4 iteration 2 in this iteration we trained the microsoft custom vision model to detect and classify to differentiate inapplicable covid 19 pneumonia and normal chest x ray images we created four classes of images with varying counts see table 2 iteration 2 with labels inapplicable covid 19 pneumonia and normal the model was trained on a compact domain with advanced training for mobile device inference we also published the model to obtain the rest api for cloud based inference the model did not perform as expected in mobile inference however the average precision of the model was 98 6 despite having varying image count 2 5 iteration 3 in this iteration we trained the microsoft custom vision model to detect and classify to differentiate inapplicable covid 19 pneumonia and normal chest x ray images we created four classes of images with varying counts see table 2 iteration 3 with labels inapplicable covid 19 pneumonia and normal the model was trained on a compact domain with advanced training for mobile device inference we also published the model to obtain the rest api for cloud based inference custom vision detected imbalanced image data counts and suggested the distribution of image per tag should be uniform to ensure model performance the model was unstable and we did not port the model for mobile device inference however the average precision of the model was 96 6 despite having an imbalanced image data count see table 2 iteration 3 7 2 6 iteration 4 in this iteration we trained the microsoft custom vision model to detect and classify to differentiate inapplicable covid 19 pneumonia normal negative covid 19 ct and normal ct chest x ray and ct images we created seven classes of images with varying counts see table 2 iteration 4 with labels inapplicable covid 19 pneumonia normal negative covid 19 ct and normal ct the model was trained on a compact domain with advanced training for mobile device inference we did not publish the model to obtain rest api for cloud based inference since custom vision detected imbalanced image data counts and suggested the distribution of image per tag should be uniform to ensure model performance however the model was ported to smartphone app to observe and study the behavior of an unstable model for mobile device inference our study showed that the ported tensorflow model amplified the instability when it comes to mobile device inference the average precision of the model was 95 1 despite having an imbalanced image data count see table 2 iteration 4 2 7 iteration 5 in this iteration we trained the microsoft custom vision model to detect and classify to differentiate inapplicable covid 19 pneumonia normal covid 19 ct and normal ct chest x ray and ct images we created six classes of images with varying counts see table 2 iteration 5 with labels inapplicable covid 19 pneumonia normal covid 19 ct and normal ct the model was trained on a compact domain with advanced training for mobile device inference we did not publish the model to obtain the rest api for cloud based inference however the model was ported to the mobile app to observe and study the behavior of an unstable model for mobile inference our study showed that the ported tensorflow model amplified the instability when it comes to mobile inference the average precision of the model was 98 0 despite having an imbalanced image data count see table 2 iteration 5 2 8 iteration 6 in this iteration we trained the microsoft custom vision model to detect and classify to differentiate inapplicable covid 19 pneumonia normal covid 19 ct and normal ct chest x ray and ct images we created six classes of images with fixed counts 275 images each see table 2 iteration 6 with labels inapplicable covid 19 pneumonia normal covid 19 ct and normal ct the model was trained on a compact domain with advanced training for mobile device inference we did not publish the model to obtain the rest api for cloud based inference however the model was ported to the mobile app to observe and study the behavior of a stable model for mobile inference our study showed that the ported tensorflow model performs significantly much better when it comes to mobile device inference we decided to deploy this trained model to build our smartphone based diagnostic app the average precision of the model was 96 8 with balanced 275 images each image data count see table 2 iteration 6 8 2 9 iteration 7 iteration 7 is the same as iteration 6 except being trained on the general domain with the view to publishing it for rest api consumption iteration 7 produces rest api which we used to construct a web application that can be used for inference outside the custom vision site iteration 7 trained on the general domain exhibits slight improvement over the compact domain with 97 0 average precision see table 2 iteration 7 3 implementation 3 1 web application we implemented our web application in php programming language and called the rest api in it uploaded images are stored in a custom vision site and can be used for training iterations this raises an issue of data privacy which should be resolved by the respective jurisdiction when implemented custom vision permits to download the entire trained network in tensorflowjs format once implemented as a web service the trained network downloads itself into the browser and inference is done locally so no data leaves the browser this is a more secure and data protection friendly option microsoft custom vision has a documentation page on how to consume rest api 9 3 2 mobile application we have downloaded a trained model in tensorflowlite and coreml format from custom vision to build android and ios applications smartphone applications are capable of real time inference with zero latency as the trained model runs entirely on the mobile app it does not require an internet connection for image classification this feature particularly important in rural areas of developing countries where internet connection is not reliable or not available at all microsoft has a github repository with a sample code for app building in android studio and apple xcode 10 we used apple macbook pro with macos high sierra intel core i 5 8 gb ram and intel iris plus graphics 655 gpu 1536 mb 256 ssd to build android and ios app our android and ios applications are publicly available mobile app apk file can be downloaded from https softavion com cxr download php

data each one with only 25 images we achieved 100 precision 100 recall and 100 average precision for all classes of images in other words our ai model could correctly call covid 19 positive and covid 19 negative 100 all the time as the model was loaded with more classes and images of different counts we could see the variance in performance metrics as we experimented with different combinations of data and classes see table 2 the most convincing and favorable results https softavion com cxr download php 9 were obtained in iteration 6 where we used 275 images for each class see table 2 in which we trained the model to detect and classify 6 different classes after optimizing the model we obtained a training precision of 96 1 recall accuracy of 96 1 and average precision accuracy of 96 8 see table 2 point to be noted that we achieved 100 recall and 99 4 average precision for covid 19 class let a be a true positive b be a false negative c is false positive and d be true negative then accuracy precision recall and f 1 score can be calculated using the given formula accuracy a d a b c d the probability threshold t controls the trade off between the true positive rate i e precision and true negative rate i e recall to investigate the impact of t on the network performance we performed the inference stage with different values of t including 50 40 30 20 and 10 for iteration 6 the

interestingly to the same average precision value though both the precision and recall are variable and when the parameter t decreases from 50 to 10 the precision drops from 96 1 to 91 2 and the recall increases from 96 1 to 97 6 as the model primarily trained for covid 19 detection the proposed method aims to reduce the false negative rate as much as possible since false positive cases can potentially be identified in the subsequent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt pcr but false negative cases will not have a chance for a second test and would be potentially deadly by spreading covid 19 in their locality therefore we suggest setting the parameter t to a small value like 10 to reduce the false negative rate to as low as 2 4 in our study the smartphone application

performance comparison we tried to develop a smartphone based real time covid 19 detector app with the view to use them in rural and understaffed areas having access with only an x ray machine the lack of sufficient covid 19 x ray training data resulting in poor performance classifying pneumonic and normal x ray from covid 19 x ray when it comes to smartphone based inference authors observed that the same trained network performed comparatively poor in smartphone app than the web app the magnitude of the performance difference due to smartphone configuration variance is yet to study class

technique playing a crucial role in clinical care and epidemiological studies 11 12 ordinary care facilities including rural areas have deployed x ray units as basic diagnostic imaging besides realtime imaging of x rays with smartphone application would significantly speed up the disease screening considering these advantages we aimed to develop a deep learning based model that can detect covid 19 based on chest x ray and ct images with adequately high sensitivity with smartphone based application enabling fast and reliable primary diagnosis if primary screening is found positive covid 19 patients will then be facilitated to be tested with rt pcr in this process a suspected covid 19 patient will less expose himself to other people though x ray is cheaper than a ct scan and is more economically viable detecting covid 19 using chest x rays with high sensitivity is very challenging not only due to the ribs overlying soft tissue and low contrast but also because of the limited availability of a large number of annotated data this is specifically true for deep learning based approaches for image detection and classification as deep learning is infamously data hungry though we have collected a significantly large number of image data of ordinary pneumonia and normal chest x ray 6 the unavailability of sufficient covid 19 induced pneumonic chest x ray data prohibited us to use all ordinary pneumonia and normal chest x ray data in network training as this would lead to overfitting and biasing the network our training iterations exhibited the result of an imbalanced network see table 2 to address the data imbalance problem we can synthetically generate new covid 19 x ray image data from existing data by using a special type of neural network called generative adversarial network gan as we used monotonous training image data with only anterior posterior ap and posterior anterior pa position the authors think high counts of augmented training data can solve the problem as in inapplicable class we could see a high level of augmented data is available and the model achieved 100 accuracy with the same 275 image data count in that view we can employ the generative adversarial network gan to generate new augmented data from existing data to improve the smartphone inference accuracy of covid 19 x ray we have tested six android smartphone with different configuration running our app and found out that newer smartphone issued after 2018 with faster processor high megapixel camera module and bigger ram performs better than others this is because the trained tensorflow neural network runs on the mobile device s processor for real time image classification we did not test the iphone app in our study in medical imaging it remains a challenging goal on how to generate realistic medical images completely different from the original ones synthetic images obtained from generative adversarial network gan would improve diagnostic reliability allowing for data augmentation in computer assisted diagnosis where real data are in scarcity a plain vanilla gan first coined by goodfellow et al 2014 20 is a generative model that was designed for directly drawing samples from the desired data distribution without the need to explicitly model the underlying probability density function it consists of two neural networks the generator g and the discriminator d the input to g z is pure random noise sampled from a prior distribution p z which is commonly chosen to be a gaussian or a uniform distribution for simplicity the output of g xg is expected to have visual similarity with the real sample xr that is drawn from the real data distribution pr x we denote the nonlinear mapping function learned by g parameterized by g as xg g z g the input to d is either a real or generated sample the output of d y 1 is a single value indicating the probability of the input being a real or fake sample the mapping learned by d parameterized by d is denoted as y 1 d x d 13 the generated samples form a distribution pg x which is desired to be an approximation of pr x after successful training d s objective is to differentiate these two groups of images whereas the generator g is trained to confuse the discriminator d as much as possible intuitively g could be viewed as a forger trying to produce some quality counterfeit material and d could be regarded as the policeman trying to detect the forged items fig 2 a plain gan schematic diagram in an alternative view we can perceive g as receiving a reward signal from d depending upon whether the generated data is accurate or not the gradient information is back propagated from d to g so g adapts its parameters to produce an output image that can fool d the training objectives of d and g can be expressed mathematically as ld gan maxdexr pr x logd xr exg pg x log 1 d xg lg gan mingexg pg x log 1 d xg as can be seen d is simply a binary classifier with a maximum log likelihood objective if the discriminator d is trained to optimality before the next generator g updates then minimizing lg gan is proven to be equivalent to minimizing the jensen shannon js divergence between pr x and pg x the desired outcome after training is that samples formed by xg should approximate the real data distribution pr x the inception and advancement of machine learning programs are rapidly changing many aspects of health care various studies involving artificial intelligence have been performed in the areas of dermatology ophthalmology radiology and pathology 31 32 ai has also been utilized in the classification and detection of infectious diseases as well as cardiology programs that assist in identifying patients with heart failure improving cardiovascular risk predictions and improving heart failure survival analysis the performance advantages of ai programs will be essential in worldwide modern healthcare recent ai studies attempted with various smartphone applications 33 34 35 have experimented with microscopy real world images generator sample sample la te n t ra n d o m v a ri a b le discriminator lo ss real fake 14 and diagnosis of dermatology lesions 37 data analysis composed of diagnostic images genetic expression testing and electrophysiological procedures is converted into valuable assets which may be utilized in treatment decisions thus reducing errors and improving overall outcomes it has been shown in previous studies that ai programs demonstrated successful learning ability from large numbers of data sets providing further classification into subcategories that are then more easily diagnosed and interpreted performed on large data sets these pioneer studies provided further inspiration for useful deep learning studies on even smaller sets of x ray clinical images in this study we investigated the ability of an automated ai service to detect and classify covid 19 induced pneumonia in a smartphone based realtime application from a limited number of dataset our study primarily reveals that properly augmented dataset has a huge impact on smartphone based real time inference a neural network trained on a properly augmented dataset can be used in various ai android iphone applications smartphone based diagnosis technologies like this will become progressively significant and vital in remote and rural areas of the developing world lacking accessible healthcare facilities limitations and further study the study is a retrospective one based on publicly available datasets a prospective study based on demographically and morphologically distinct patients would be more relevant the paucity of published data on ethnically equivalent population made comparison impossible further work can be done by generating synthetic covid 19 x ray data with deep convolutional generative adversarial networks dcgan and the progressive growing generative adversarial networks pggan for better augmentation in model training research 67 showed that pggan can produce a better image than dcgan however this raises the question of ethical and legal issues in real life implementation but we can use it in our realtime smartphone app for performance comparison this study may pave the way for further research and development in this intriguing field 6 conclusions our study shows how an automated ai service can be used to rapidly build and deploy a medical diagnostic service that can do primary screening in a pandemic situation like covid 19 recent advances in ai technology democratize ai to be used in various industries smartphone based imaging and sensing platforms are emerging as promising alternatives for bridging the gap and decentralizing diagnostic tests offering practical features such as portability cost effectiveness and connectivity in 2020 the current global population is 7 7 billion and the smartphone penetration rate is at 45 4 percent in other words more than four out of every ten people in the world are currently equipped with a smartphone a smartphone based primary diagnostic service can bring a huge difference in the quality of life especially in developing countries declaration of conflicting
