an arithmetic and geometric mean invariant john lindgren and vibeke libby john lindgren stanfordalumni org agilemath october 29 2018 abstract a positive real interval a b can be partitioned into sub intervals such that sub interval widths divided by sub interval average values remains constant that both arithmetic mean and geometric mean average values produce constant ratios for the same log scale is the stated invariance proved in this short note the continuous analog is briefly considered and shown to have similar properties 1 problem and summary define a relative weight for an interval a b with 0 a b as the interval length divided by the average value in the interval we explore interval partitions of a b that have equal relative weights for consecutive sub intervals and show that there is a surprising invariance to whether we use arithmetic or geometric averages or even an interval endpoint for the definition of average the ratios shown in figure 1 for a partition of 1 16 are seen to be constant when using either the arithmetic or geometric means of sub interval endpoints 2 main result theorem 1 given an interval a b there is a partition a x 0 x 1 xn b 1 1 ar x iv 1 20 3 46 17 v 1 cs n a 2 0 m ar 2 01 2 such that the following equations are satisfied xi 1 xi xi 1 xi 2 xj 1 xj xj 1 xj 2 i j 0 1 n 2 xi 1 xi xi 1 xi xj 1 xj xj 1 xj i j 0 1 n 3 moreover the partition satisfying the conditions is given by xi b i na n i n 4 3 proof the invariance follows by considering the ratio between consecutive terms zi 1 xi 1 xi 5 3 1 the am case the arithmetic mean am case follows from zi 1 1 zi 1 1 zi 1 zi 1 6 reduction yields zi 1 1 zi 1 zi 1 1 zi 1 7 zi 1 zi 1 zi 1 zi 1 zi 1 zi 8 2 figure 1 interval endpoints plotted on a log scale for 1 16 with n 4 sub intervals 3 2 the gm case the geometric mean gm case follows similarly zi 1 1 xi 1 xi xi zi 1 xixi 1 xi 1 zi 1 1 zi 1 zi 1 zi 9 zi zi 1 1 zi 1 zi 1 10 zizi 1 zi 1 1 zizi 1 zizi 1 zi 1 zizi 1 0 11 factoring the last equation results in zizi 1 zi 1 zi 0 zi 1 zi 12 3 finally the actual partition can now be determined for both the am and the gm cases zi 1 xi 1 xi c 13 b xn cxn 1 c nx 0 c na 14 c b a 1 n 15 xi cxi 1 b a 1 nxi 1 b a 2 nxi 2 b a i nx 0 b i na i na bi na n i n 16 qed 4 continuous analog mean using an interval endpoint for the average of each sub interval yields exactly the same recurrence relationship as n goes to infinity the corre sponding differential equation is given by x x k n 17 dx x k dn 18 ln x kn c x n aebn 19 when the same boundary conditions specified in the discrete case are given for x the constants a and b in the above equation produce the same log scale solution as the discrete cases 5 background the problem has its origin in generating test sets for an optical bench part of the em spectrum was to be sampled into bands and the bands were to be selected such that the relative error would remain roughly constant for all bands 4 avg 20 further analysis showed that the choice of average made no differ ence in selecting test bands 6 references 1 stanislas dehaene vronique izard elizabeth spelke and pierre pica log or linear distinct intuitions of the number scale in western and amazonian indigene cultures science 2008 320 5880 1217 doi 10 1126 science 1156540 5 1 problem and summary 2 main result 3 proof 3 1 the am case 3 2 the gm case 4 continuous analog mean 5 background 6 references
