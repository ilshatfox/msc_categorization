ar x iv 1 11 0 15 84 v 3 m at h l o 1 8 o ct 2 01 1 martin s maximum and tower forcing sean cox and matteo viale abstract there are several examples in the literature showing that compactness like properties of a cardinal cause poor be havior of some generic ultrapowers which have critical point burke 1 when is a supercompact cardinal foreman magidor 6 when 2 in the presence of strong forcing axioms we prove more instances of this phenomenon first the reflection princi ple rp implies that if i is a tower of ideals which concentrates on the class gic 1 of 1 guessing internally club sets then i is not presaturated a set is 1 guessing iff its transitive collapse has the 1 approximation property as defined in hamkins 10 this theorem combined with work from 16 shows that if pfa or mm holds and there is an inaccessible cardinal then there is a tower with critical point 2 which is not presaturated moreover this tower is significantly different from the non presaturated tower already known by foreman magidor 6 to exist in all models of martin s maximum the conjunction of the strong reflection principle srp and the tree property at 2 has similar impli cations for towers of ideals which concentrate on the wider class gis 1 of 1 guessing internally stationary sets finally we show that the word presaturated cannot be re placed by precipitous in the theorems above martin s maximum which implies srp and the tree property at 2 is consistent with a precipitous tower on gic 1 1 introduction if the universe v of sets satisfies zfc there is no elementary em bedding j v n where n is wellfounded and the least ordinal moved by j is small like 1 or 2 forcing with ideals and towers of ideals are two procedures that can potentially produce such an em bedding j v n in some generic extension of v where the least ordinal moved by j is small a tower of ideals is a sequence of ideals i i with a certain coherence property see section 2 4 the length of the sequence i is called the height of i and if each ideal in the sequence has the same completeness 1 this completeness is called 1 this will hold for all towers considered in this paper 1 http arxiv org abs 1110 1584 v 3 2 sean cox and matteo viale the critical point of i if i is a tower then there is a natural poset p i associated with i and in the generic extension v p i there is an embed ding jg v ult v g where the least ordinal moved by j equals the critical point of the tower this embedding is called a generic ultrapower of v by i and ult v g is not necessarily wellfounded properties of the tower i and of its height affect the properties of the generic ultrapower woodin proved that if is a woodin cardinal then many of the natural stationary towers of height satisfy a very strong property called presaturation see 13 and 18 foreman and magidor 6 proved that if is a supercompact cardinal then there are several natural stationary towers of height which are precipitous a property weaker than presaturation for simplicity let us only consider towers with critical point 2 then one key difference between the foreman magidor stationary towers and the woodin stationary towers are that with woodin s examples there are always some v regular cardinals which become cofinal in the generic ultrapower whereas they remain uncountably cofinal in the generic ultrapower in the foreman magidor examples on the other hand compactness like properties of the critical point of the tower can often prevent nice behavior of the tower burke 1 showed that if is supercompact and is inaccessible then there is a tower of height with critical point which is not precipitous strong forcing axioms like the proper forcing axiom and martin s maximum are known to make 2 behave much like a supercompact cardinal so in light of burke s theorem we should expect that strong forcing axioms prevent nice behavior of some towers with critical point 2 foreman and magidor 6 proved that martin s maximum 2 implies that a certain natural tower 3 with critical point 2 is not presaturated see example 9 16 of 5 4 on a related note they also showed that the proper forcing axiom implies that there is no presaturated ideal on 2 this paper provides more results along the lines of the burke and foreman magidor theorems that compactness properties of the critical point of certain towers prevents nice behavior of the tower we show that under strong forcing axioms there are certain towers with critical 2 really just the saturation of ns 1 3 namely the stationary tower concentrating on the 1 internally approachable structures 4 however their tower can be precipitous and in fact always is precipitous if its height is a supercompact cardinal martin s maximum and tower forcing 3 point 2 which are not presaturated these towers are significantly dif ferent from the non presaturated towers produced in foreman magidor 6 in a very strong sense 5 specifically theorem 1 assume rp 2 holds whenever i is a tower which concentrates on the class gic 1 of 1 guessing internally club sets then i is not presaturated in fact we show more that rp 2 implies there is no single ideal j such that j concentrates on gic 1 and j bounds its completeness the latter is a property introduced by the first author in 2 which is closely related to saturation and chang s conjecture see definition 23 and theorem 25 using theorem 1 and results from 16 we show theorem 2 assume either pfa or mm and that is inaccessible then there is a tower of height with critical point 2 which is not presaturated in fact this tower even fails to have the weak chang property see definition 20 and corollary 22 the hypotheses of theorem 1 can be strengthened to obtain a stronger conclusion theorem 3 assume srp 2 and the tree property at 2 when ever i is a tower which concentrates on the class gis 1 of 1 guessing internally stationary sets then i is not presaturated again similarly to theorem 1 we actually show more that srp 2 together with the tree property at 2 implies there is no single ideal which concentrates on gis 1 and bounds its completeness if we require the tower to be definable then a theorem of burke 1 together with the isomorphism theorem from 15 yields theorem 4 zfc if 2 2 then there is no precipitous tower of inaccessible height which concentrates on gic 1 and is definable over v finally we prove that in theorems 1 through 3 the conclusion can not be strengthened to say there is no precipitous tower which concen trates on the relevant class of sets even if the hypothesis is strengthened to plus versions of martin s maximum 5 namely while the foreman magidor tower concentrated on internally approach able structures our ideals concentrate on structures which are definitely not inter nally approachable 4 sean cox and matteo viale theorem 5 if is supercompact and is inaccessible then if p is the standard iteration to produce a model of mm 1 there is a precipitous tower in v p of height concentrating on gic 1 the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides relevant back ground on guessing models 2 1 forcing axioms and reflection princi ples 2 2 the key isomorphism theorems for 1 guessing structures from 15 2 3 towers of ultrafilters and ideals 2 4 and induced tow ers 2 5 those last two subsections 2 4 and 2 5 are used primarily for the consistency proof in section 6 though definition 16 and fact 17 are used throughout the paper section 3 provides a brief review of the weak chang property and relevant theorems from 2 that will be used in the later proofs in sections 4 and 5 but not in section 6 section 4 proves theorems 1 4 and 2 section 5 proves theorem 3 the results in sections 4 and 5 are due to both authors section 6 proves theorem 5 and is due to the first author section 7 ends with some open problems 2 preliminaries 2 1 the classes gic 1 gis 1 and giu 1 weiss 17 introduced the notion isp which is a significant strengthening of the tree prop erty in this paper we use the alternative notion of a guessing model from 15 zf denotes zf without the power set axiom definition 6 let h be a transitive zf model and regh we say that h has the approximation property iff h v has the approximation property as in hamkins 10 in other words for ev ery h whenever a is such that z a h for every z h with z h then a h if 1 m h for some regular uncountable we say m is 1 guessing iff its transitive collapse hm has the 1 approximation property 6 we let g 1 denote the class of m such that m 1 m and m is 1 guessing m hm m will always denote the inverse of the mostowski collapse of m we use several other common classes of structures see foreman and todorcevic 8 a set m is 1 internally club iff m m contains a club in m 1 internally stationary iff m m is stationary in m and 1 internally unbounded iff m m is cofinal in m let m m satisfies zf 1 m and m 1 we 6 this definition is slightly different but equivalent to the definition in 15 fur ther note that since we re assuming m h and 1 m then z hm iff z for any z hm martin s maximum and tower forcing 5 let ic 1 is 1 and iu 1 refer respectively to the class of m which are 1 internally club 1 internally stationary and 1 internally unbounded the classes ic 1 is 1 and iu 1 can be equivalently characterized in ways analogous to internal approachability m ia 1 iff there is a continuous chain n 1 such that m 1 n and n m for every 1 m ic 1 iff there is a continuous chain n 1 such that m 1 n and n m for every 1 m is 1 iff there is a continuous chain n 1 such that m 1 n and n m for stationarily many 1 it is straightforward to see that m is 1 iff there is some stationary tm 1 such that for every continuous chain n with union m 1 n m ns tm 7 m iu 1 iff there is a chain n 1 such that m 1 n set gic 1 g 1 ic 1 gis 1 g 1 is 1 and giu 1 g 1 iu 1 note that g 1 ia 1 is always empty 8 note also that all of the classes mentioned are invariant under isomorphism i e m is in the class iff its transitive collapse hm is in the class viale and weiss proved theorem 7 viale weiss 16 pfa implies that gic 1 2 h is stationary for all regular 2 their proof actually produced models which were not only gic 1 but persistently so that is these models remain in gic 1 in any outer model which has the same 1 this used the following generalization of a theorem of baumgartner for a poset r and a possibly non transitive set m let us say that a filter g r is m r generic iff g d m 6 for every d m which is dense in r theorem 8 viale weiss 16 for each regular 2 there is a proper poset r such that 1 r h 2 r h gic 1 where h h v 3 whenever m is a possibly non transitive zf model such that m 1 m and there exists some g which is m r generic then 7 for a b 1 a ns b means that 1 a b is nonstationary 8 this is because if m ia 1 as witnessed by some sequence n n 1 then for every countable z m z n m if m were in g 1 this would imply that n m and then that m m which is of course impossible 6 sean cox and matteo viale m h gic 1 if w is any transitive zf model such that m g r w and w 1 v 1 then w m gic 1 here w could for example be any outer model of v which has the same 1 viale proved lemma 9 viale ma 1 implies g 1 iu 1 so g 1 giu 1 proof viale 15 proved that if m is 1 guessing and m is strictly less than the so called pseudo intersection number then m iu 1 ma 1 implies that the pseudo intersection number is 2 finally we point out the standard fact that all of these classes project lemma 10 let z be any of the classes g 1 ia 1 ic 1 is 1 or iu 1 if m z and 2 is a regular cardinal then m h z proof here it will be more convenient to work with the following non transitivised characterization of g 1 m g 1 iff for every m and every a m if a z m for every countable z m then there is some a m such that a m a now suppose m g 1 and 2 is regular we want to see that m h g 1 let m and a m and suppose z a m h for every countable z m h then clearly z a m for every countable z m since a since m g 1 then there is an a m with a m a set a a m h then a m h a for the other classes we present the argument for ic 1 the rest are similar suppose m ic 1 as witnessed by a sequence n 1 where n m for every 1 let be a regular uncountable cardinal clearly the sequence n h 1 is increasing and continuous with union m h we just need to see that n h m h for every 1 if m this is trivial if m then since m ic 1 m ord is an closed set of ordinals and so sup m has uncountable cofinality then for each 1 there is some m such that n h n h and the latter is in m since both and n are in m it is interesting to point out that by the argument of proposition 2 4 of 6 if z is any of the classes ia 1 ic 1 is 1 or iu 1 then z also lifts with respect to the nonstationary ideal that is if s is a stationary subset of z 2 h and then z m 2 h m h martin s maximum and tower forcing 7 s is also stationary this implies that ns z 2 h ord forms a tower see section 3 on the other hand this can trivially fail for the class z g 1 because g 1 2 h might be nonstationary for large even if g 1 2 h is stationary for every regular 2 as is the case under pfa it is still not clear and seems doubtful that ns g 1 2 h ord necessarily forms a tower 2 2 forcing axioms projective stationarity and reflection principles let be a class of posets and an ordinal fa means that for every p for every 1 sized collection d of dense subsets of p and for every sequence s such that p s 1 is stationary for every then there is a filter f p meeting ev ery d d and such that for every s f 1 q f q s is stationary fa means fa 0 and fa means fa 1 martin s axiom is ma ccc posets the proper forc ing axiom pfa isma proper posets and martin s maximum mm is ma posets preserving stationary subsets of 1 we caution that elsewhere in the literature the notation pfa and mm are some times used for what we call pfa 1 and mm 1 it is widely known that the standard iteration used to produce a model of mm resp pfa actually produces a model of mm 1 resp pfa 1 for a regular cardinal 2 rp means that whenever s is stationary then there is an x such that 1 x x 1 and s x is stationary in x it is well known that fa closed implies rp for all regular 2 so in particular rp follows from pfa and by 7 this is also implied by mm a set p x is projective stationary iff for every stationary t 1 y p y 1 t is stationary in x equivalently the projection of p to 1 contains a club subset of 1 for 2 the strong reflection principle at srp is the statement for every projective stationary p h there is a continuous elementary chain n 1 of countable models such that every n is an element of p i e there is some 1 sized subset x of such that p x contains a club in x it was shown in 3 that martin s maximum implies srp for all regular 2 extending a result of gitik 9 velickovic proved the following theorem see section 3 of 14 theorem 11 whenever c 2 is club x r and t 1 is stationary then there are a b c c such that a 1 b 1 c 1 t and x l 2 a b c 8 sean cox and matteo viale corollary 12 if w is a transitive zf model with 2 w and r w 6 then 2 w is projective stationary proof let t 1 be stationary we need to show that d 2 d w and d 1 t is stationary in 2 suppose not then there is a club c 2 such that c t d c d 1 t w let x r be arbitrary and let a b c c be as in theorem 11 so that x l 2 a b c and a 1 b 1 c 1 t so a b c c t w since 2 w zf and a b c w then l 2 a b c w so x w since x was arbitrary we ve shown r w contrary to the assumptions 2 3 isomorphism theorems for gic 1 and gis 1 we use the isomorphism theorems from viale 15 for transitive zf models m and m we say that m is a hereditary initial segment of m iff m m or there is some cardm such that m h m for possibly non transitive m and m we say m is a hereditary initial segment of m iff this holds for their transitive collapses theorem 13 viale assume 2 2 let be a regular uncount able cardinal 2 and a wellorder on h suppose m and m are submodels of h such that m 2 m 2 if m and m are gic 1 then one is a hereditary initial segment of the other if m and m are gis 1 tm 1 and tm 1 witness that m m is 1 respectively and tm tm is stationary then one of m m is a hereditary initial segment of the other 2 4 towers of measures and towers of ideals suppose z is a set and f z is a filter the support of f supp f is the set z for all instances in this paper the support of a filter will always be a transitive set typically some h and z will always be of the form h for some regular ultra filter will always mean a normal 9 countably complete fine 10 ultra filter if f is a filter then f denotes its dual ideal similarly if i is an ideal then i denotes its dual filter if is a class we say that a filter f concentrates on iff there is an a f such that a if i is an ideal we say that i concentrates on iff its dual filter concentrates on a set s i is i positive written s i iff s i 9 f is normal iff for every regressive g z v there is an s f such that g s is constant 10 i e for every b supp f there is an a f such that b m for all m a note if f is fine then its support is equal to f martin s maximum and tower forcing 9 definition 14 if z z i z and i z are ideals we say that i is the canonical projection of i to z iff i m z m a a i suppose w is a transitive model of set theory and u is a possibly external w normal 11 fine ultrafilter say u z where z w for example z might be w h w it is a standard fact that if ju w u ult w u zw w u is the ultrapower and z is transitive then 1 ju z is an element of ult w u and is represented by id z u if the wellfounded part of ult w u has been transitivized then j z is an element of ult w u and is represented by f u where f m the inverse of the mostowski collapse map of m of course if u w then ult w u is wellfounded but the comments above show that z is always an element of the transitivised well founded part of ult w u even when u is external to w one com mon example of this external case is generic ultrapowers suppose i z is an ideal 12 and let pi i if g is v pi generic then g is an ultrafilter on v z which is normal 13 with respect to sequences from v in particular 1 holds and jg z ult v g now consider generalizations of these notions to sequences of filters which cohere via the canonical projection relation in definition 14 definition 15 let w be a transitive model of set theory and a regular cardinal in w let z w and for simplicity assume each z v w and each z is transitive and z v w suppose u is a possibly external to w sequence of w normal ultrafilters where u z for each also assume there is a fixed such that each u has completeness we will call u a tower of w normal measures iff for every u is the canonical projection of u to z as in definition 14 if u is a tower of w normal measures then there is a commutative system of maps obtained by the various ultrapower maps ju w u ult w u and for maps k ult w u ult w u given by f u 7 m 7 f m z u the direct limit map of the 11 i e normal with respect to sequences from w 12 recall we are assuming all ideals are normal fine and countably complete 13 by a density argument and the fact that i was a normal ideal 10 sean cox and matteo viale system is denoted j u w u n u if u w then this direct limit will always be wellfounded and closed under sequences from w so if in addition j u then j u can witness the almost hugeness of cr j u in w 14 a possibly external direct limit embedding j u w u n u can also be viewed as an ultrapower embedding as follows given a partial function f v w w with f w let supp f denote the least cardinal such that f x only depends on x h let b w f w f v w w and supp f define an equivalence relation u on b w by f u g iff m z f m h g m h u for all sufficiently large define a relation u on b w u in the obvious way this will be well defined then the direct limit n u e u will be isomorphic to b w u u for this reason we will write ult w u for this direct limit the los theorem will hold in the following form for each f 0 fn in b w and each formula n u f 0 u fn u iff m z w f 0 m fn m u for every sufficiently large the following analogues of 1 always hold when taking possibly external ultrapowers by a tower of w normal measures 2 for every x v w j u x is an element of ult w u and is repre sented by the function m 7 m x u j u x is an element of ult w u and is repre sented by m 7 the inverse of the mostowski collapse map of m x just as forcing with the positive sets of an ideal gives rise to external ultrapowers of v by a single v normal measure forcing with a tower of ideals defined below gives rise to an external ultrapower of v by a tower of v normal measures definition 16 a sequence i is called a tower of ideals of height iff for every i is the canonical projection in the sense of definition 14 of i to z we will also require for simplicity that for each if z is such that i z then z h in this paper z will always be of the form h for a class we say that i concentrates on iff every ideal in the sequence concentrates on 14 see theorem 24 11 of kanamori 12 for technical criteria on u which will guarantee that j u is an almost huge embedding martin s maximum and tower forcing 11 if i is a tower there is a natural poset p i associated with i condi tions are pairs s where and s i a condition s is strengthened by increasing to some and refining the lifting of s to h more precisely s s iff and s sz m z m h s if g is generic for p i then let proj g s v z s g this is an ultrafilter on v z which is normal with respect to sequences from v though proj g need not be v pi generic and proj g is a tower of v normal measures as in definition 15 in particular 2 holds and one can prove the following general facts in the case of towers we use the notation jg v g ult v g to denote the ultrapower embedding j u v u ult v u where u proj g fact 17 if i is a tower of height where is inaccessible and g is generic for i then 1 for every d v jg d ult v g 2 for every u proj g s v z jg h jg s this fact combined with item 1 and the assumption that is strongly inaccessible implies that proj g ult v g for every 3 for every and every y v the relations proj g h y v and proj g h y v are elements of ult v g this follows from the previous bullets both h y v and proj g are elements of ult v g 4 if i concentrates on m m and m and jproj g v ult v proj g is the ultrapower map by proj g then kproj g proj g jproj g id we refer the reader to foreman 5 for the general theory of towers and to larson 13 and woodin 18 for the specific cases where all the ideals i in the tower are of the form ns z towers of this form are called stationary towers 2 5 induced towers of ideals we adjust example 3 30 from 5 to towers definition 18 suppose q is a poset is inaccessible and u is a sequence of q names such that q u is a tower of v normal ultrafilters for each let i be the collection of a such that for every v q generic object h a u h the sequence i will be called the tower of ideals derived from the name u it is straightforward to check that this indeed forms a tower of ideals 12 sean cox and matteo viale recall that if j v n is an embedding with critical point and p v is a poset such that j p p j p is a regular embedding 15 then j p is forcing equivalent to p j p j g where g is the canonical p name for the p generic further whenever g h is generic for p j p j g then j can be lifted in v g h to an elementary jg h v g n g h suppose is a v cardinal such that for every j h n then for every 3 ug h a a v g and j g h h g jg h a is a v g normal ultrafilter then from the point of view of v g the poset j p g forces that u g h is a tower of v g normal measures external to v g of course then in v g let i be the tower of normal ideals derived from the name u g h as in definition 18 here v g is playing the role of v and j p g is playing the role of q from definition 18 definition 19 the tower i v g described in the last paragraph will be called the tower induced by j we caution that if j u v n u is an embedding by a tower of v normal measures j u p p j u p is a regular embedding g is v p generic and i v g is the tower induced by j u as in definition 19 then for each it will not in general be the case that the dual of i extends u this is because of the way that the measure ug h is defined in 3 the measure ug h concentrates on elementary substructures of h g not on elementary substructures of h this is only a minor technical issue however generally n u j g h u h g j u h and it follows that for every there are u g h many m h g such that m v v see corollary 29 for the use of derived towers in this setting 3 the weak chang property and ideals which bound their completeness in this section we discuss presaturation of towers and some concepts introduced by the first author in 2 which will be used in the proofs of theorems 25 and 27 these concepts are related to chang s conjec ture bounding by canonical functions and saturation for the reader s convenience all relevant proofs are included here 15 i e whenever a p is a maximal antichain then j a is a maximal antichain in j p martin s maximum and tower forcing 13 a tower of height is called presaturated iff always remains a regu lar cardinal in generic extensions by the tower such a tower is always precipitous and ult v g is closed under sequences from v g see proposition 9 2 of 5 woodin showed that if is a woodin cardinal there are several stationary towers of height which are presaturated we use the following weakening of presaturation introduced in 2 definition 20 cox 2 a tower of inaccessible height has the weak chang property iff whenever g is generic for the tower then is an element of the wellfounded part of ult v g and is regular in ult v g though not necessarily in v g lemma 21 let if a tower i of height concentrates on m m m then i has the weak chang property iff it forces that jg proof the fact that i concentrates on implies that will be the critical point of jg and jg for any generic g see 5 since jg is the successor of in ult v g the equivalence follows easily corollary 22 let and assume i is a tower of height which concentrates on m m m if i is presaturated then it satisfies the weak chang property for the next lemma we will use the following definition which is also related to saturation properties of ideals see 2 definition 23 cox 2 let j be a normal ideal over h where completeness j h we say j bounds its completeness iff for every f there are j many m such that otp m ord f m lemma 24 suppose i i u is a tower of inaccessible height has completeness concentrates on m m m and has the weak chang property then 1 for every generic g and every jproj g 2 there is a restriction of some ideal in the tower which bounds its completeness proof part 1 suppose not let and let g and be such that jproj g by assumption jg so in fact jproj g f proj g f z v by fact 17 f proj g f z v is an element of ult v g moreover f proj g f z v ult v g z v ult v g z v v 14 sean cox and matteo viale by inaccessibility of in v this contradicts that is regular in ult v g part 2 by part 1 with there is a condition a in the tower which decides the value of jproj g as some without loss of generality assume 4 we show that i a bounds its completeness a similar argument shows that i a v bounds its completeness for every let f suppose for a contradiction that there were some a a such that a is i positive and for every m a otp m ord f m note also that m ord m for all m a let g be generic for the tower with a g then a proj g v and so m 7 otp m proj g v m 7 f m proj g v now f maps into so f proj g jproj g so by part 4 of fact 17 f proj g is not moved by kproj g proj g v f proj g kproj g proj g v f proj g m 7 f m proj g v but this implies a contradiction 4 rp and towers on gic 1 in this section we prove theorems 1 4 and 2 4 1 proof of theorem 1 theorem 1 follows from corollary 22 lemma 24 and the following theorem 25 assume rp 2 then there is no ideal i which bounds its completeness and concentrates on gic 1 proof todorcevic proved thatrp 2 implies 2 2 see theorem 37 18 of 11 if ch holds then for every 2 the set of 1 guessing submodels of h is nonstationary see 15 and the theorem holds trivially so suppose from now on that 2 2 suppose for a contradiction that i is a normal ideal concentrating on some stationary subset s of gic 1 at some h and that i bounds its completeness which is 2 without loss of generality we assume that for every m s m h where is some enumeration of the reals for each proj s 2 let t be the collection of all transitive sets of the form hm where m s and m 2 martin s maximum and tower forcing 15 let i be the projection of i to 2 claim 25 1 for i measure one many s sup ht h h t is at least 2 proof of claim 25 1 suppose not so there is some s which is i positive and for every m s sm 2 2 let f 2 2 be defined by sending 7 s if s 2 and f 0 otherwise since i bounds its completeness there is some c i such that for every m c otp m ord ht hm f m 2 then for every m c s f m 2 sm 2 ht hm fix any m c s and let m 2 then 5 s ht hm yet h m t this is clearly a contradiction to the definition of s fix any such that s 2 and let w t now s gic 1 so by theorem 13 whenever h and h are elements of t and ht h ht h then h is a hereditary initial segment of h this implies that w is a transitive zfc model of height 2 since h ic 1 for every h t then 6 for every 2 w contains a club to see why 6 holds let 2 pick an h t such that h ord and let n 1 witness that h ic 1 then n 1 is a closed unbounded subset of and each n is an element of h w now r w in particular r w 6 by theorem 11 s 2 w is stationary in fact projective stationary by rp 2 there is a 2 such that s is stationary 16 this contradicts 6 4 2 proof of theorem 4 now we prove theorem 4 that is if rp is omitted from the hypothesis of theorem 1 the isomorphism theorem for gic 1 prevents precipitous towers on gic 1 which are definable proof if ch holds there are no g 1 structures so the theorem is trivial so assume 2 2 suppose i i u were such a tower by lemma 4 3 of burke 1 a precipitous tower is not an element of the 16 this uses the fact that 1 2 is a club subset of 2 1 and that rp 2 implies the following apparently stronger statement see theorem 3 1 of feng jech 4 for every stationary s 2 there are stationarily many z 2 1 such that 1 z and s z is stationary 16 sean cox and matteo viale generic ultrapower 17 since we are assuming the tower is definable over v to obtain a contradiction it suffices to show that v is an element of some generic ultrapower by the tower let g be generic for the tower by fact 17 hv ult v g for each u also since i concentrates on gic 1 and 1 cr jg then by the los theorem ult v g hv gic 1 for each set v 2 by theorem 13 for each ult v g believes there is at most one h such that h is a transitive zf model of height h ord such that rult v g h rult v g hv 2 thus when ult v g takes the union of all such models of height the result is v since for each u h ult v g is such an h so v ult v g and we have a contradiction 4 3 proof of theorem 2 finally we prove theorem 2 it is well known that either mm or pfa implies rp so theorem 2 will follow from theorem 1 and the following lemma 26 assume pfa and let be inaccessible then there is a tower of height which concentrates on gic 1 proof in 16 it was shown that pfa implies that gic 1 2 h is stationary for all regular 2 for each set z m h m gic 1 2 v and set i the projection of ns gic 1 2 v to a normal ideal on z it is straightforward to check that a sequence of ideals defined in this way is a tower by lemma 10 each z gic 1 2 h alternatively once can check that the sequence z satisfies lemma 9 49 of 5 and then use burke s stabilization technique to produce a tower of ideals concentrating on the z s it is not clear whether this yields the same tower as the previous paragraph 5 srp and towers on gis 1 in this section we prove theorem 3 the tree property at tp is the statement that every tree of height and width has a cofinal branch theorem 3 follows from corollary 22 lemma 24 and the following theorem theorem 27 assume srp 2 and tp 2 then there is no ideal concentrating on gis 1 which bounds its own completeness first note that srp implies that ns 1 is saturated and that 2 2 see chapter 37 of 11 17 if the generic embedding moves which is always the case if the tower con centrates on m m m martin s maximum and tower forcing 17 suppose for a contradiction that i concentrates on some stationary s gis 1 and bounds its own completeness which is 2 without loss of generality we can assume that for every m s m h where is some wellorder of the reals and h is the support of i for each m s let tm 1 be the stationary set witnessing that m is 1 for each proj s 2 define t hm m s and m 2 the downward closure of t under the hereditary initial segment relation 18 forms a tree of height 2 claim 27 1 for each proj s 2 the tree t has width 2 proof fix such an and a level 2 of the tree t note that ifh is at the th level then there is some m s such that h h hm where is the th regular cardinal of hm or hm ord without loss of generality we assume 2 then it is straightforward to show that m h m h m gis 1 and that the set tm which witnesses that m is 1 also witnesses that m h m is 1 suppose for a contradiction that level had at least 2 many distinct nodes h 2 and say t 1 witnesses that h is 1 note all the h s have the same intersection with the reals namely so they have the same intersection with h 1 as well for any distinct pair and since h 6 h then t t is nonstationary by theorem 13 but then t 2 would be an 2 sized antichain for ns 1 contradicting the fact that ns 1 is saturated let i be the projection of i to 2 claim 27 2 for i measure one many 2 the tree t has height 2 proof the proof of claim 25 1 can be repeated verbatim so by claims 27 1 and 27 2 for i measure one many 2 t is a thin tree of height 2 fix such an by tp 2 t has a cofinal branch the union of this branch is a transitive zfc model w of height 2 now w r so in particular r w 6 and so by corollary 12 s 2 w is projective stationary let s n h 2 n 2 s then s is projective stationary in h 2 19 18 i e the nodes of t consists of transitive models of the form hm and models of the form h hm where reghm 19 this is standard if t 1 is stationary then st z 2 z 1 t is stationary by the projective stationarity of s let a be a structure on h 2 in a countable language we need to find an elementary substructure of a whose intersection with 1 is in t pick any z st such that sk a z 2 z this 18 sean cox and matteo viale by srp 2 there is a continuous chain n 1 of elemen tary substructures of h 2 such that n s for every 1 let z 1 n 2 it can easily be shown that z is an ordinal 20 in particular z is an element of some h t this implies that proj h z a z a h h is a subset of h also proj h z is stationary in z since h h is stationary by assumption more over c n 2 1 s and c is a club subset of z s so proj h z c is nonempty but proj h z h w yet c s and s w a contradiction this completes the proof of theorem 27 6 consistency of mm with a precipitous tower on gic 1 now we prove theorem 5 first we need a tower version of propo sition 7 13 from 5 theorem 28 modification of proposition 7 13 from 5 for towers suppose q v is a poset and 1 q remains inaccessible u is a tower of v normal measures and ult v u is wellfounded suppose also that in v there are functions q h and for each q q a function fq such that q h and each fq each have bounded support in v for every q generic object h q uh q h uh h for every q q fq uh q if i v is the tower derived from the name u as in definition 18 then p i is precipitous forcing equivalent to q and generic ultrapowers by i are exactly those maps of the form j uh v ult v uh where h is v q generic proof first we note that if i is a tower where each ideal i z then the poset p i as defined in section 2 4 is forcing equivalent to holds for all but nonstationarily many z st then sk a z s is the model we seek 20 let 2 1 n and let we need to see that 1 n let be such that n since n h 2 there is a bijection f 1 such that f n let f 1 and pick any such that n and then both f and are elements of n so n martin s maximum and tower forcing 19 the poset obtained as follows define an equivalence relation on p i s and s i by 7 s t iff sz tz i for some equiva lently every max let p i p i and partially order p i in the natural way inherited from the partial ordering of p i 21 now let i be the tower derived from the name u as in the statement of the theorem similarly to the way proposition 7 13 from 5 is proved we define a map p i ro q by 8 s 7 j uh z j uh s ro q it is straightforward to check that this map is well defined and pre serves order and incompatibility further identifying q with its iso morphic copy in ro q the assumptions of the theorem imply that q range given q q let fq be as in the statement of the theo rem and let q be the support of fq and without loss of generality assume q is also greater than the support of h and q then maps the condition q m z q fq m h m to q finally we sketch why generic ultrapowers by i are exactly those embeddings of the form j uh for some h which is v q generic first suppose g is v p i generic and let h be the v q generic obtained from g and the map or vice versa the argument is similar either way define a map ult v uh ult v g by f uh 7 f g then one can show that maps onto ult v g and that jg j uh corollary 29 suppose u v is a tower of normal ultrafilters of inaccessible height and j u v u n u is the ultrapower suppose p v and that j u p p j u p is a regular embedding let g be v p generic and let i v g be the tower of height induced by j u as in definition 19 then in v g i is precipitous p i is forcing equivalent to j u p j u g and generic ultrapowers of v g by i are exactly those maps of the form jg h u v g n u g h where h is j u p j u g generic over v g 21 another way to view the poset p i is to consider the directed system of canoni cal liftings z i z i for defined by s i 7 s z i then p i is the direct limit of this system 20 sean cox and matteo viale proof let g be v p generic we check the conditions of theorem 28 here v g will play the role of the v from theorem 28 and j u p j u g will play the role of the q from theorem 28 work in v g for all h which are v g j u p j u g generic for every there are ug h many m such that 1 m v v 22 denote this set m 2 v m p is a regular subposet of p since we assume p v there is some p such that p h p now consider the following functions defined in v g on a m v g m v v and m p is a regular subposet of p q m p g m note this equals p g m hv p h m the generic for p g m obtained from g and the forcing equivalence between p and m p p g m note this only depends on m hv p for any q j u p g note that q v and there is some fq v v with support q such that q fq u then define in v g the function f q by m 7 fq m hv q note that each of these functions has bounded support in v q and h have support p and f q has support q it is straightforward to check that for every h which is v g j u p j u g generic q ug h j u p j u g h ug h h for each q j u p j u g fq ug h q the conclusion then follows by theorem 28 it is interesting to note that if i v g is as in corollary 29 and is always moved by generic embeddings of v by i 23 then generic ultrapowers of v g by i do not have p i as an element by lemma 4 3 of 1 however these generic ultrapowers do have a poset namely j u p j u g which from the point of view of v g is forcing equiv alent to p i and all the generic ultrapowers even have a v g generic for that poset now back to the proof of theorem 5 suppose is supercompact and is inaccessible let lav v be a laver function for and p the standard rcs iteration of length which yields a model of martin s maximum as in 7 this actually produces a model ofmm 1 in v let u be a normal measure on h for some regular such that ju lav r where r is the poset from theorem 8 and r 22 this holds for ug h many m because n u j g h u h g j u h 23 this is always the case if each u in the original tower concentrates on h martin s maximum and tower forcing 21 is the canonical p name for r v p let u u be the tower of normal measures produced from projections of u to h for let j u v n u recall n u is closed under sequences so in particular j u h n u for every since p has the cc then j u p id p j u p is a regular embedding so the discussion before definition 19 applies fix some g which is v p generic and in v g let i be the tower of ideals induced by j u as in definition 19 by corollary 29 9 i is precipitous so we only have left to show that i concentrates on gic 1 first we note claim 30 j u lav r proof by standard arguments there is a k n u ult v u such that k j u ju and k id now r ju lav k j u lav k k j u lav so r range k recall from theorem 8 that the poset r is always an element of h so the canonical p name r for rv p is an element of h v h ult v u so r ult v u then since r range k we have r ult v u range k this implies that cr k equivalently that j u and that k 1 r r consider an arbitrary h which is v g j u p g generic let h denote the th component of h now n u g h v g gic 1 because h is n u g r n u g generic note v v n u because n u is closed under sequences from v since n u g h is an outer model of n u g h with the same 1 then theorem 8 implies 10 n u g h v g gic 1 by 10 and the transitivised variant of theorem 10 11 for every v regular n u g h h g gic 1 since jg h u h g is an element of n u g h for every and the class gic 1 is closed under isomorphism then 11 implies 12 for every v regular n u g h jg h u h g is an element of gic 1 22 sean cox and matteo viale since 12 holds for arbitrary generic h then by the definition of each i 13 for each i concentrates on gic 1 this concludes the proof of theorem 5 7 questions we end with some questions we proved that under rp 2 there is no presaturated tower which concentrates on gic 1 this suggests a couple of questions question 31 is it consistent with rp 2 that there is a presatu rated tower concentrating on gis 1 question 32 is it consistent with zfc to have a presaturated tower which concentrates on gic 1 one way to produce a presaturated tower on gis 1 is to perform a mitchell collapse so that an almost huge cardinal becomes 2 how ever rp 2 fails in this model so it does not provide an affirmative answer to question 31 we also showed that mm implies there is no presaturated tower on gis 1 which suggests question 33 is it consistent with mm that there is a presaturated tower concentrating on giu 1 question 34 if the answer to either of the previous questions is yes can this tower be a stationary tower or any other kind of natural tower finally in theorem 4 we showed there is no precipitous tower on gic 1 which is definable over v where is the height of the tower question 35 suppose ns 1 is saturated does this imply that there is no precipitous tower on gis 1 which is definable over v where is the height of the tower references 1 douglas r burke precipitous towers of normal filters j symbolic logic 62 1997 no 3 741 754 doi 10
