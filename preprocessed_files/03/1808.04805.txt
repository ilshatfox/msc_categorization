polynomial ring over a field i k x 1 xn and whenever fg i for f g of degree b then either f i or g i when b is sufficiently large it turns out that i is prime schmidt g ttsch proved 24 that sufficiently large can be taken to be a polynomial in the degree of generators of i with the degree of this polynomial depending on n however schmidt g ttsch used model theoretic methods to show this and did not give any indication of how large the degree of this polynomial is in this paper we obtain an explicit bound on b polynomial in the degree of the generators of i we also give a similar bound for detecting maximal ideals in k x 1 xn 1 introduction suppose i is an ideal of a polynomial ring over a field i k x 1 xn and whenever fg i for f g of degree b then either f i or g i when b is sufficiently large it turns out that i is prime schmidt g ttsch proved 24 that sufficiently large can be taken to be a polynomial in the degree of generators of i with the degree of this polynomial

on b polynomial in the degree of the generators of i we also give a similar bound for detecting maximal ideals in k x 1 xn our problem belongs to a thread of algorithmic algebra going back over a century drawing on the work of kronecker noether and others hermann published in 1926 a seminal paper entitled die frage der endlich vielen schritte in der theorie der polynomideale the question of finitely many steps in polynomial ideal theory 15 see 16 for an english translation with commentary hermann obtained bounds on calculations in polynomial rings over fields such as witnessing ideal membership and finding bases of syzygies other tasks she showed to be algorithmically possible include primary decomposition intersection and quotients of ideals date june 10 2019 partially supported

seidenberg analyzed extended and in some cases corrected her mann s work he noted p 311 26 that one can decide primality of polynomial ideals over explicitly given fields by determining if the ideal is primary and if so whether the ideal is equal to its associated prime sei denberg gave bounds on some steps of the process but did not analyze the complexity of deciding primality buchberger s method of gr bner bases introduced in his thesis 4 see section 3 for basic results provided strong impetus to the development of computational algebra while many problems are in principle solvable by the methods of hermann and seidenberg the theory of gr bner bases has grown substantially and is often more convenient in particular much work has been done on the complexity of gr bner bases mayr and mayer 21 established doubly exponential worst case bounds on the complexity of gr bner bases as a function of the number of indeterminates building on subsequent efforts dub 9 gave a sharper but still doubly exponential bound that we take as a starting point for our analysis in 3 18 gr bner basis methods can be used as building blocks for algorithms that test primality in polynomial rings gianni trager and zacharias 12 pp 157 158 described an algorithm for deciding primality by among other things inductively reducing the number of variables to the univariate case eisenbud huneke and vasconcelos 10 gave a method for carrying out pri mary decomposition of ideals in polynomial rings over perfect fields one may then follow seidenberg s observation to decide primality to our knowledge no one has explicitly analyzed the complexity of these algorithms however many of our bounds in section 3 concern steps of the algorithm from 12 as presented in 1 another result related to our problem is lemma 10 of 6 there chistov shows that there is a constant c n such that given an algebraic variety defined by polynomials in n variables of total degree at most d irreducible components of the variety are defined by polynomials of total degree at most d 2 cn our main result is theorem 1 1 there exists a function b n d that is polynomially bounded in d and such that for any field k and proper ideal i k x 1 xn with generators of total degree at most d if fg i implies that either f i or g i for all f g of degree less than or equal to b n d then i is prime moreover b n d max 2 d 2 3 n 2 2 n 2 nd n n 1 224 n 6 for all n d 1 if n 1 d 1 or d 1 the values b 1 d d or b n 1 0 respectively suffice to ensure primality see theorems 4 26 and 4 35 for the final steps of the proof the function b n d is defined in the course of the argument and a more compact bound easily follows see 4 36 corollary 1 2 b n d 2 nd n 326 n 2 for all n d 1 polynomial bounds in polynomial rings 3 schmidt g ttsch 24 showed that the function b n d is polynomially bounded in d using ultraproduct methods as in 30 25 and 13 but did not give any explicit calculation of the bound abstract results from proof theory 17 29 suggest that it is possible to extract explicit bounds from proofs that use ultraproducts the authors demonstrated 27 that such methods can be used to extract explicit bounds from ultraproduct proofs in commutative and differential algebra 14 30 for instance in theorem 2 8 and lemma 7 7 of 27 we gave another bound on b n d but that bound was not polynomial in the degree of the generators however the arguments here while inspired by schmidt g ttsch s approach were not purely extracted by proof theory instead we bring in known results using gr bner bases etc where possible and add new arguments to simplify or clarify the most complicated parts of schmidt g ttsch s argument 2 outline of the argument we briefly describe our strategy we are interested in counterexamples to primality that is polynomials f g i such that fg i our goal is to show that if there are no counterexamples to primality of i having degree b n d or less we say i is prime up to b n d then there are no counterexamples of any degree i e i is prime the main ingredients are localization of polynomial rings bounds on gr bner bases for various auxiliary ideals and bounds on solutions to systems of linear equations over polynomial rings relabeling if necessary choose a maximal set of indeterminates x 1 xr that is algebraically independent modulo i by independence mod i we have k x 1 xr i 0 by maximality k x 1 xr xj i 6 0 for any j r without loss of generality we may assume that no xi i otherwise we solve the problem for smaller n localize with respect to the variables x 1 xr that is consider the ideal j ik x 1 xr xr 1 xn generated by i in the ring k x 1 xr xr 1 xn the first main task is to show that k x 1 xn j i this step requires induction to prove that there are no counterexamples to primality of i in which one factor belongs to k x 1 xr here we use bounds on gr bner bases of saturation and quotient ideals the second major task is to show that j is maximal we introduce a maximal ideal m extending j and prove that j m this step uses various tools such as the primitive element theorem flat extensions and bounds on gr bner bases for elimination ideals we also require some complicated inductive arguments on the number of variables xr 1 xn once we know that j is maximal and hence prime we conclude that i is prime we are principally concerned with the inductive definition of b n d and obtaining a relatively clean estimate rather than precise values of constants and lower order terms for this reason and for readability our estimate of 4 william simmons and henry towsner the bound is somewhat relaxed compared to the actual content of the proofs by following closely the interested reader may keep track of such details 3 preliminary definitions and results throughout the section k denotes an arbitrary field except for theorems 3 7 and 3 8 which require that k have positive characteristic we use the following algebraic result to control degrees when going from rational functions to polynomials theorem 3 1 gauss lemma let r be a unique factorization domain ufd and let f be the fraction field of r if p x r x factors as q 1 x q 2 x in f x such that q 1 q 2 have degrees d 1 d 2 in x then p x factors as p 1 x p 2 x in r x where the degrees of p 1 p 2 are also d 1 d 2 respectively proof see for example corollary 2 2 in 19 the following version of a well known theorem in field theory plays a prominent role in section 4 when we consider the case of zero dimensional ideals theorem 3 2 primitive element theorem let f k be a field extension with f being an infinite field let a b k be algebraic of degrees r s respectively over f further assume that b is separable over f then for all but at most r s 1 choices of c f the linear combination a cb generates the field f a b over f proof see 31 p 139 though the bound is clear from the proof we summarize the argument here because it is reappears in the proof of theorem 4 21 let 1 r and 1 s be the roots counting multiplicity of the minimal polynomials f of a and g of b respectively over f we work in an extension of k containing the roots we may assume that 1 a and 1 b by separability i 6 j for i 6 j the list 1 r may contain repetition consider the r s 1 many equations i x j a xb where 1 i r and j 6 1 since j 6 b each equation has at most one solution in f and except for at most r s 1 elements none of the infinitely many remaining elements c f satisfies any of the equations let c f satisfy none of the equations we claim that f a b f a cb consider the polynomials g x and f a cb cx both of which belong to f a cb x and have a common root b they have no other root in common another root j of g with j 6 1 yields an argument a cb c j of f that cannot equal i for any i lest c satisfy a forbidden equation it follows that g and f a cb cx have a gcd of degree 1 in f a cb x if they were coprime they could have no common root if the gcd had degree greater than 1 they would have another common root or g would have a repeated root contradicting separability this gcd must be x b whence b f a cb and also a f a cb polynomial bounds in polynomial rings 5 3 1 bounds on solutions to linear equations in polynomial rings much of our work is done with gr bner bases but it is sometimes convenient to use an older tool from hermann s paper 16 theorem 3 3 let k be a field and let n 1 n 2 n consider the system of homogeneous equations j n 2 fijxj 0 i n 1 where the coefficients fij are polynomials in k x 1 xn of total degree at most d then every solution in k x 1 xn n 2 of the system may be written as a linear combination over k x 1 xn of solutions that each have total degree at most 2 n 1 d 2 n proof see theorem 3 2 of 2 for this version of the bound other proofs of the basic result are theorem 1 of 26 and theorem 2 of 16 for the original remark 3 4 in 27 theorem 2 5 we call this fact internal flatness be cause it is equivalent to flatness of extensions of polynomial rings by internal polynomial rings in the sense of nonstandard analysis 2 refers to such re sults as effective flatness the preceding theorem generalizes to inhomogenous equations here the relationship is with faithfully flat extensions theorem 3 5 let k be a field and let n 1 n 2 n consider the system of equations j n 2 fijyj hi i n 1 where the fij hi k x 1 xn have total degree at most d if the equation has a solution in k x 1 xn n 2 then there exists a solution y y 1 yn 2 such that each yj has total degree at most 2 n 1 d 2 n proof see theorem 3 4 of 2 or p 92 of 22 for this bound seidenberg 26 and hermann 16 gave earlier proofs but contain some errors see p 1 2 we also need a version of faithful flatness over the function field k x 1 xn theorem 3 6 let k be a field and let n 1 n 2 n consider the system of equations j n 2 fijzj hi i n 1 where the fij hi k x 1 xn have total degree at most d if the system has a solution in k x 1 xn n 2 then there exists a solution z z 1 zn 2 k x 1 xn n 2 such that each zj may be written as a ratio of polynomials of total degree at most 2 n 1 d 2 n proof let z z 1 z n 2 k x 1 xn n 2 be a solution to the system multiply every equation in the system by the product of all denominators of z 1 z n 2 it follows that there is a solution in k x 1 xn n 2 1 to the homogeneous system j n 2 fijz j hiz i n 1 such that z 6 0 hence theorem 3 3 implies that there is a solution in k x 1 xn n 2 1 with each entry having total degree at most 2 n 1 d 2 n and z 6 0 divide each entry by the nonzero value of z to obtain the desired solution z to the original system 6 william simmons and henry towsner the remaining flatness results require the field k to have characteristic p 0 theorem 3 7 based on lemma 2 11 of 24 let p m n 1 n 2 n with p prime and let k be a field of characteristic p consider the system of homogeneous equations j n 2 fijy pm j 0 i n 1 where the fij are polyno mials in k x 1 xn of total degree at most b then every solution in k x 1 xn n 2 of the system may be written as a linear combination over k x 1 xn of solutions that each have total degree at most 2 n 2 1 n 2 b n n pm n 1 b 2 n proof let v 0 be a basis in k of the set of k pm linear combinations of the coefficients of all the fij define v 1 to be the set of all power products x l 1 1 x ln n 0 lj p m finally let v v 0 v 1 v 0 v 0 v 1 v 1 since v 0 is a basis and each variable in an element of v 1 has power less than pm it follows that v is linearly independent over kp m x pm 1 x pm n each fij may therefore be written uniquely as a sum v v fij vv where fij v k pm x pm 1 x pm n substituting for fij and changing the order of addition the system j n 2 fijy pm j 0 i n 1 becomes v v j n 2 fij vy pm j v 0 i n 1 by linear indepen dence we may replace this with an equivalent system j n 2 fij vy pm j 0 v v i n 1 whose coefficients belong to k pm x pm 1 x pm n this is a polyno mial ring over the field kp m so by 3 3 every solution of j n 2 fij vzj 0 v v i n 1 in k pm x pm 1 x pm n n 2 is a kp m x pm 1 x pm n linear combina tion of solutions having bounded degree that bound depends on the num ber of equations in the system and on the total degrees of fij v as polynomials in x pm 1 x pm n the former is n 1 v where v is the cardinality of v in turn v is the product of the cardinalities v 0 and v 1 lemma 3 10 im plies that v 0 n 1 n 2 the number of monomials in any fij n 1 n 2 b n n note that v 1 p mn so v v 0 v 1 n 1 n 2 b n n pmn since the fij v are obtained by factoring out powers of x pm 1 x pm n from monomials of the fij the degree of the fij v as polynomials in k pm x pm 1 x pm n is at most b pm thus by 3 3 the desired bound is 2 n 1 v b pm 2 n 2 n 21 n 2 b n n pm n 1 b 2 n theorem 3 8 let p m n 1 n 2 n with p prime and let k be a field of characteristic p consider the system of equations j n 2 fijy pm j hi i n 1 where fij hi are polynomials in k x 1 xn of total degree at most b if the system has a solution in k x 1 xn n 2 then there is a solution y y 1 yn 2 k x 1 xn n 2 such that each yj may be written as a ratio of polynomials of total degree at most 2 n 21 n 2 1 b n n pm n 1 b 2 n proof we use the same approach as in theorem 3 6 consider the ho mogeneous system j n 2 fijy pm j hiy pm 0 i n 1 where y is a new polynomial bounds in polynomial rings 7 indeterminate by 3 7 every solution in k x 1 xn n 2 1 of the homoge neous system may be written as a k x 1 xn linear combination of solu tions that each have total degree at most 2 n 21 n 2 1 b n n pm n 1 b 2 n there is a solution in k x 1 xn n 2 to the original system so by clear ing denominators we obtain a solution in k x 1 xn n 2 1 to the homo geneous system for which y 6 0 therefore there is a bounded solution y y 1 y n 2 y n 2 1 k x 1 xn n 2 1 such that y n 2 1 6 0 di vide y by y n 2 1 to obtain a bounded solution y 1 y n 2 1 y n 2 y n 2 1 1 in k x 1 xn n 2 1 then y y 1 y n 2 1 y n 2 y n 2 1 is the desired solution to the original equation 3 2 gr bner bases the basic properties of gr bner bases are laid out in many places see for instance 1 3 5 7 18 we need the following notions and facts definition 3 9 in the polynomial ring k x 1 xn a power product of variables x 1 xn is a product x r 1 1 x rn n for some nonnegative integers ri if all ri are zero we write 1 for the product a monomial ordering on k x 1 xn is a well ordering of the set of power products such that 1 the product 1 is the least element with respect to and 2 respects multiplication by power products if x r 1 1 x rn n x s 1 1 x sn n then xt 11 x tn n x r 1 1 x rn n x r 1 t 1 1 x rn tn n x s 1 t 1 1 x sn tn n x t 1 1 x tn n x s 1 1 x sn n lemma 3 10 for positive integers n d there are d n 1 n 1 power products of total degree d in the indeterminates x 1 xn counting 1 as a power product with each variable having degree 0 there are d n n power products of total degree at most d proof this follows from an elementary counting argument see e g the stars and bars method in 28 definition 3 11 let be a monomial ordering on k x 1 xn the leading term lt f of a nonzero polynomial f is the monomial axr 1 xrn of f such that the power product xr 1 xrn is maximal with respect to the coefficient a of the leading term is the leading coefficient lc f of f note that a monomial is simply a power product multiplied by a field element definition 3 12 let be a monomial ordering on k x 1 xn and let i k x 1 xn be an ideal a set of nonzero polynomials g 1 gt belonging to i is a gr bner basis with respect to for i if for every f i there exists some i such that the leading term lt gi of gi divides the leading term lt f of f definition 3 13 let f f 1 fs k x 1 xn be a finite set of nonzero polynomials a polynomial f k x 1 xn is reducible with re spect to f if f contains a nonzero monomial that is divisible by lt fi for 8 william simmons and henry towsner some 1 i s otherwise we say that f is reduced modulo f a reduced gr bner basis is one such that each generator is reduced with respect to the set containing all the others theorem 3 14 division algorithm for k x 1 xn let f f 1 fs k x 1 xn be a finite set of nonzero polynomials and let be a monomial ordering on k x 1 xn for every polynomial f there exist u 1 us r k x 1 xn such that 1 f u 1 f 1 usfs r 2 r is reduced modulo f 3 lt f lt uifi for all 1 i s and 4 either r is zero or f is reduced with respect to f in which case ui 0 and f r or lt r lt f proof see theorem 1 5 9 of 1 when f u 1 f 1 usfs r as in the theorem we say f reduces to r modulo f theorem 3 15 let g be a gr bner basis for a nonzero ideal i a poly nomial f k x 1 xn belongs to i if and only f reduces to 0 modulo g proof see theorem 1 6 2 of 1 definition 3 16 let f g k x 1 xn let lcm t 1 t 2 denote the least common multiple of two power products t 1 t 2 we define the s polynomial s f g of f g to be lcm lt f lt g lt f f lcm lt f lt g lt g g theorem 3 17 buchberger s criterion given a monomial ordering let g k x 1 xn be a finite set of nonzero polynomials g is a gr bner basis of the ideal generated by g if and only if s f g reduces to 0 modulo g for all f g g proof see theorem 1 7 4 1 theorem 3 18 let i be a nonzero ideal of k x 1 xn generated by poly nomials of total degree at most d then for any monomial ordering there is a reduced gr bner basis of i whose elements have total degree at most b 1 n d min 2 d 2 n 2 d 2 2 d 2 n 1 proof the bound 2 d 2 2 d 2 n 1 was given by dub see corollary 8 3 of 9 note also that 2 d 2 n is greater than or equal to dub s bound when ever d 1 for d 1 the constant bound 1 suffices it follows from buchberger s criterion 3 17 that after gaussian elimination we are left with a gr bner basis see theorem 5 68 in 3 polynomial bounds in polynomial rings 9 remark 3 19 we consider the more generous bound 2 d 2 n because later we compose bounds with each other and we desire a relatively clean final answer theorem 3 20 let i k x 1 xn be an ideal generated by polynomials of total degree at most d if g g 1 gt is a reduced gr bner basis of i whose elements have degree at most b 1 n d then t b 1 n d 1 n 1 proof since g is reduced no leading term of gi divides a leading term of gj for i 6 j it suffices to find an upper bound on sets of monomials of total degree at most b 1 n d such that no monomial in the set divides another we induct on the number of variables the constant value 1 clearly works for n 1 assume the claim holds for n 1 for any 0 b 1 n d consider the set gx 1 of leading terms of g such that x 1 appears with degree since no element of gx 1 divides another the same is true of the set gx 1 x 1 of monomials formed by dividing the elements of gx 1 by x 1 by the inductive hypothesis gx 1 x 1 and hence gx 1 has at most b 1 n d 1 n 2 elements g is partitioned into b 1 n d 1 sets of size at most b 1 n d 1 n 2 so g has at most b 1 n d 1 n 1 elements as desired remark 3 21 as noted earlier we aim for simplicity rather than sharpness for a more detailed analysis of the number of generators in a gr bner basis see 23 the issue is closely related to dickson s lemma see 11 20 for bounds in that setting we now convert the basic bound b 1 n d into bounds on the auxiliary ideals that appear in the next section definition 3 22 a monomial ordering of k y 1 ym x 1 xn is an elimination ordering if every power product in k x 1 xn other than 1 is greater than every power product in k y 1 ym if i k y 1 ym x 1 xn is an ideal then i k y 1 ym is an elimination ideal that eliminates the x variables theorem 3 23 let be an elimination ordering of k y 1 ym x 1 xn such that power products in the x variables are greater than products in the y variables let g be a gr bner basis with respect to of an ideal i k y 1 ym x 1 xn such that the elimination ideal i k y 1 ym is nonzero then g k y 1 ym is a gr bner basis of i k y 1 ym proof see theorem 2 3 4 of 1 theorem 3 24 let be an elimination ordering of k y 1 ym x 1 xn such that power products in the x variables are greater than products in the y variables let i k y 1 ym x 1 xn be generated by polynomials of to tal degree at most d also suppose that the elimination ideal i k y 1 ym is nonzero then there there is a gr bner basis with respect to of i k y 1 ym whose elements have total degree at most b 1 m n d 10 william simmons and henry towsner proof by theorem 3 23 the elimination ideal i k y 1 ym has a gr bner basis that is a subset of the gr bner basis of i given by 3 18 theorem 3 25 let i k x 1 xn be generated by polynomials of total degree at most d and let u k x 1 xn also have total degree at most d if there exists a nonzero polynomial p k x 1 xr y where y is a new indeterminate and r n such that p u i then there exists a nonzero polynomial q k x 1 xr y of total degree at most b 1 n 1 d such that q u i proof consider the ideal i i y u k x 1 xn y since p u i it follows that p y i use an elimination ordering in which power products of xr 1 xn are greater than power products in x 1 xr y since the elimination ideal i k x 1 xr y is nonzero by theorem 3 24 there is a gr bner basis of i k x 1 xr y whose elements have total degree at most b 1 n 1 d let q be an element of this gr bner basis note that q y i implies that q u i 3 3 quotients and saturations definition 3 26 let i and j be ideals of a commutative ring r the quotient ideal of i by j denoted i j is defined to be f r jf i f r gf i for all g j theorem 3 27 1 let i and j be ideals of k x 1 xn and let w be a new variable then i j wi 1 w j k x 1 xn 2 let i be an ideal of k x 1 xn let f be a nonzero polynomial then the quotient ideal i f 1 f i f proof see proposition 2 3 5 and lemma 2 3 11 of 1 theorem 3 28 if i k x 1 xn is a nonzero ideal generated by polyno mials of total degree at most d and f is a nonzero polynomial of total degree at most d then the quotient ideal i f has a gr bner basis whose elements have total degree at most b 1 n 1 d 1 proof by properties of a monomial ordering the leading term of a product is the product of the leading terms it follows from this and part 2 of 3 27 that by dividing the elements of a gr bner basis for i f by f we obtain a gr bner basis for i f hence it suffices to give a bound on gr bner bases of i f by part 1 of 3 27 i f wi 1 w f k x 1 xn where w is a new variable use an elimination ordering with w the greatest variable to eliminate w from an ideal generated by polynomials of total degree at most d 1 then 3 18 and 3 24 imply that i f has a gr bner basis of total degree at most b 1 n 1 d 1 polynomial bounds in polynomial rings 11 definition 3 29 let a be a commutative ring with 1 a subset s of a is a multiplicative set if 1 s 0 s and xy s for all x y s if i is an ideal of a the saturation of i by s is the set of all elements a a such that for some s s we have sa i we write i s to denote the saturation of i by s if b is a nonnilpotent element of a we denote the multiplicative set 1 b b 2 by b and write the saturation as i b remark 3 30 it is easy to see that i s is an ideal containing i an equivalent characterization is that the saturation is the intersection s 1 i a where s 1 i is the ideal generated by i in the localization s 1 a in 4 4 we saturate an ideal i k x 1 xn by the multiplicative set k xi 0 to compute bounds on generators of this saturation we must consider gr bner bases of polynomials with coefficients from more general rings the definition of a gr bner basis is slightly different from the field case to account for the fact that coefficients might be zero divisors or fail to be units monomial orderings on the set of power products are the same however also in this paper we only consider the case when the coefficient ring is a noetherian integral domain for the precise definition see definition 4 1 13 of 1 the details are not necessary for our purposes because of the following theorem theorem 3 31 let g be a gr bner basis in the sense of fields of an ideal i k y x 1 xn with respect to an elimination order with the x variables greater than y then g is a gr bner basis in the sense of noetherian integral domains of i viewed as an ideal of k y x 1 xn proof see theorem 4 1 18 in 1 theorem 3 32 let r be a noetherian integral domain let g r y 1 ym be a nonzero polynomial and let i be an ideal of r y 1 ym letting w be a new variable we have i g i wg 1 r y 1 ym proof see proposition 4 4 1 in 1 theorem 3 33 let r be a noetherian integral domain and let i r y 1 ym be an ideal having a gr bner basis g g 1 gt in the sense of noether ian integral domains let g lc g 1 lc g 2 lc gt be the product of the leading coefficients of the elements of g then i r 0 i g proof see proposition 4 4 4 in 1 theorem 3 34 if i k x 1 xn is a nonzero ideal generated by poly nomials of total degree at most d then the saturation i k x 1 0 has a gr bner basis whose elements have total degree at most b 2 n d b 1 n 1 b 1 n d 1 n 1 b 1 n d 1 proof choose an elimination ordering having x 1 as least variable by 3 18 and 3 20 i has a reduced gr bner basis g g 1 gt with respect to this ordering such that the elements of g have total degree at most b 1 n d 12 william simmons and henry towsner and t b 1 n d 1 n 1 now view i as an ideal of k x 1 x 2 xn the polynomial ring in n 1 variables over k x 1 by theorem 3 31 we know that g is still a gr bner basis in the sense of coefficient rings that are noetherian integral domains by theorem 3 33 i k x 1 0 i g where g lc g 1 lc g 2 lc gt is the product of the leading coefficients of the elements of g thus the degree of g in x 1 is bounded by tb 1 n d theorem 3 32 shows that i g i wg 1 k x 1 x 2 xn where w is a new variable hence i k x 1 0 i wg 1 k x 1 x 2 xn and we may view i wg 1 as an ideal of k x 1 x 2 xn w generated by polynomials of total degree at most tb 1 n d 1 use an elimination ordering with w the greatest variable to eliminate w from i wg 1 by 3 18 3 24 and the bound on t the resulting elimination ideal has a gr bner basis of total degree

to use k to denote an arbitrary field i denotes a proper ideal generated by polynomials f 1 fs k x 1 xn of total degree at most d as explained in the outline we choose a maximal set of indeterminates that are algebraically independent modulo i relabeling if necessary we may assume they are x 1 xr since 0 is the only polynomial in k x 1 xr i whenever fg i for f k x 1 xr 0 either g i or f g are counterexamples to primality of i definition 4 1 if i k x 1 xn is a proper ideal and b is a natural number we say that i is prime up to b if for all f g k x 1 xn of total degree at most b such that fg i either f i or g i by maximal up to b we mean that for every f 6 i with degree b f has an inverse mod i there is some g with fg 1 i before proceeding we take care of the simple cases in the main theorem theorem 4 2 let i k x 1 xn be a proper ideal generated by polynomi als of degree at most d let x 1 xr be a maximal subset of x 1 xr xn that is algebraically independent modulo i polynomial bounds in polynomial rings 13 if n 1 then i is prime if i is prime up to d if d 1 with n arbitrary then i is prime if r 0 then i is prime if i is prime up to nb 1 n d if r n then i 0 and is prime proof first let n 1 k x 1 is a principal ideal domain and i is of the form f where f is the greatest common divisor of the given generators of i f has degree at most d and i is prime if and only if f is irreducible if f is reducible no proper factor belongs to i if i is prime up to d then f is irreducible when d 1 so i is generated by linear polynomials i is necessarily prime this follows geometrically from the irreducibility of affine linear varieties therefore primality up to any natural number e g 0 vacuously guarantees primality if d 1 if r 0 by theorem 3 24 there is a nonzero polynomial i xi i k xi of degree at most b 1 n d for each x 1 xn using i to reduce higher powers of xi mod i we see that any f is equivalent mod i to some f of total degree at most nb 1 n d hence fg i if and only if f g i and then primality up to nb 1 n d ensures primality the final claim is clear remark 4 3 if any xi i then modulo i we may assume that xi does not appear in any polynomials we consider our claimed bound on detecting prime ideals increases with n so having fewer variables only makes the bound easier to prove due to the preceding theorem and remark we may safely assume in the following work that n d 1 0 r n and that xi i for any 1 i n denote by j the ideal generated by i in k x 1 xr xr 1 xn the key properties of j are that if i is prime up to a sufficient level then i j k x 1 xn and j is maximal together these prove that i is prime 4 1 proof of i j k x 1 xn to obtain this result we rely heavily on the bounds from section 3 on gr bner bases for various kinds of ideals theorem 4 4 let 1 i n if f k xi is irreducible and there exists g k x 1 xn such that fg i but g i then the degree of f is at most b 3 n d b 1 n 1 b 2 n d 1 proof let q 1 qn be generators of the saturation ideal i k xi 0 k x 1 xn by 3 34 the total degree of each generator is at most b 2 n d for each 1 l n consider the ideal i ql k xi since k xi is a pid each ideal i ql k xi is generated by some polynomial ul k xi in particular ulql i by 3 28 and 3 24 the degree of ul is at most b 3 n d b 1 n 1 b 2 n d 1 let f k xi be irreducible and let g be an element of k x 1 xn i with the property that fg i we claim that deg f max 1 l n deg ul b 3 n d 14 william simmons and henry towsner note that g i k xi 0 and so there are l k x 1 xn such that g n l 1 lql multiplying both sides by n l 1 ul we obtain n l 1 ul g n l 1 ul n l 1 lql n l 1 n l 1 ul lql i so n l 1 ul i g k xi also note that f i g k xi and that i g k xi is proper since g i given that f belongs to the same proper ideal of k xi as n l 1 ul and is irreducible f must generate the ideal and hence divide ul for some l in particular the degree of f is at most the maximum of the degrees of the ul and is less than or equal to b 3 n d as claimed remark 4 5 note that the result holds for any variable xi not necessarily one of the x 1 xr also the proof goes through unchanged for any field l and any ideal of l x 1 xn generated by elements of degree at most d this is important because in 4 8 we apply 4 4 after changing the field from k to k xi 1 xil for some subset xi 1 xil of the variables theorem 4 6 b 3 n d 2 n 22 n 6 dn 2 3 n 2 proof we compute as follows b 3 n d b 1 n 1 b 2 n d 1 2 2 n 2 n 3 dn 2 2 n 1 1 2 n 1 2 2 n 2 n 4 dn 2 2 n 1 2 n 1 2 2 n 2 2 n 5 dn 2 3 n 2 2 n 2 2 n 6 dn 2 3 n 2 we aim to show that j k x 1 xn i we consider arbitrary sub sets xi 1 xil x 1 xr of cardinality l having certain properties and show inductively that xi 1 xil xil 1 retains the properties let jl denote ik xi 1 xil remaining variables from x 1 xn and let jl 1 de note ik xi 1 xil xil 1 remaining variables from x 1 xn with this notation we have j jr theorem 4 7 let 1 l r and suppose that i f i for all irre ducible f k xi 1 xil and every subset xi 1 xil x 1 xr of cardinality l then 1 i f i for all f k xi 1 xil 0 irreducible or not and 2 jl k x 1 xn i proof the reverse containment is trivial for both parts for the forward direction let f factor as n l 1 pl for some irreducible polynomials pl k xi 1 xil and suppose fg i it follows that n l 2 pl g i p 1 which is equal to i by the hypothesis since p 1 is irreducible continuing this way we conclude that g i this proves 1 for the second claim let g jl k x 1 xn clearing denominators we see that fg i for some f k xi 1 xil part 1 implies that g i polynomial bounds in polynomial rings 15 theorem 4 8 let 1 l r and assume n 1 suppose that jl k x 1 xn i for all xi 1 xil x 1 xr and i f i for all irreducible f k xi 1 xil xil 1 of total degree at most n 1 b 3 n d then jl 1 k x 1 xn i proof by 4 7 it suffices to show that i f i for all irreducible f k xi 1 xil xil 1 pick any such f by hypothesis we already have i f i if the total degree of f is less than or equal to n 1 b 3 n d so suppose that the degree of f exceeds this at least one of the l 1 r n 1 variables must appear with degree greater than b 3 n d without loss of generality we may assume that variable is xil 1 because we assume the properties in the statement for arbitrary subsets of x 1 xr of size l by gauss lemma f remains irreducible over k xi 1 xil since 4 4 applies to irreducible univariate polynomials over any field and the xil 1 degree of f is greater than b 3 n d we deduce that jl f jl let g k x 1 xn be such that fg i we conclude from jl f jl that g jl it follows that g i because by hypothesis jl k x 1 xn i this proves that i f i as required theorem 4 9 let n d 1 if i is prime up to b 4 n d b 1 n 1 n 1 b 3 n d 1 then for all 1 l r subsets xi 1 xil x 1 xr and irreducible f k xi 1 xil of total degree at most n 1 b 3 n d we have i f i proof it suffices for the generators of i f to belong to i by 3 28 such a generator g has total degree at most b 4 n d b 1 n 1 n 1 b 3 n d 1 since fg i but f i by primality up to b 4 n d we conclude that g i theorem 4 10 let n d 1 if i is prime up to b 4 n d then j k x 1 xn i proof we induct on the size l of subsets xi 1 xil of x 1 xr to prove that jl k x 1 xn i for each 1 l r by 4 9 i f i for all irreducible f k xi 1 xil of total degree at most n 1 b 3 n d this satisfies one of the two hypotheses of 4 8 letting l 1 theorem 4 4 now implies that i f i for irreducible f k xl of any degree theorem 4 7 then yields the base case j 1 k x 1 xn we can now apply 4 8 repeatedly to obtain j k x 1 xn i 4 2 j is maximal we start with an important lemma that allows us to control the degrees of xr 1 xn modulo i lemma 4 11 let i be defined as before and suppose i is prime up to b 1 n d 16 william simmons and henry towsner 1 for each r 1 j n there is a polynomial wj i k x 1 xr xj such that wj has total degree at most b 1 n d is irreducible and remains irreducible over k x 1 xr xj 2 k x 1 xr xr 1 xn j is a finite dimensional k x 1 xr vector space of dimension at most n j r 1 dj b 1 n d n r where dj is the xj degree of wj in the first part of the lemma proof by definition of x 1 xr as a maximal algebraically indepen dent set mod i we know that i k x 1 xr 0 and that for all j r there exist elements of positive xj degree in i k x 1 xr xj by theorem 3 24 i k x 1 xr xj has a gr bner basis whose elements have total degree at most at most b 1 n d the xj degree of each gen erator is positive consider the set w w i k x 1 xr xj the total degree of w is at most b 1 n d and let n be the minimal xj degree of any element of w let wn w be the subset of w whose elements have xj degree n choose wj anx n j a 0 wn such that an k x 1 xr has minimal total degree out of all coefficients of x n j in wn we claim that wj is irreducible in k x 1 xr xj to see this suppose toward contradiction that wj properly factors as fg blx l j b 0 cmx m j c 0 then either bl k x 1 xr would have lower total degree than an or l n and likewise for cm and m since f g have total degree at most b 1 n d by primality up to b 1 n d we have f i or g i but this contradicts either minimality of n or that of an so wj does not fac tor in k x 1 xr xj by gauss lemma 3 1 wj remains irreducible over k x 1 xr xj the final claim follows from the existence of the wj and the definition of dj lemma 4 12 j is contained in a maximal ideal m of k x 1 xr xr 1 xn proof we need only show that j is proper if on the contrary 1 is a k x 1 xr xr 1 xn linear combination of f 1 fs then by clearing denominators in an equation witnessing that 1 j we obtain a nonzero ele ment k x 1 xr i this contradicts algebraic independence of x 1 xr mod i we prove that j is maximal by showing that j m a crucial step is the following 4 2 1 proof that elements of m having small degree belong to j when working in the ring k x 1 xr xr 1 xn we must keep track of the variables x 1 xr as well as xr 1 xn for convenience we use the following terminology definition 4 13 let k x 1 xr 0 with coprime as polyno mials in k x 1 xr we say the x 1 xr degree or just degree of is the maximum of the total degrees of and a monomial t where t is a power product in xr 1 xn is defined to have x 1 xr degree polynomial bounds in polynomial rings 17 equal to the sum of the x 1 xr degree of and the total degree of t given f k x 1 xr xr 1 xn 0 we define the x 1 xr degree of f to be the maximum of the x 1 xr degrees of the monomials appearing in f let j k x 1 xr xr 1 xn be a proper ideal and b a natu ral number we say j is x 1 xr prime up to b if for all f g k x 1 xr xr 1 xn of x 1 xr degree at most b such that fg j either f j or g j likewise if every f k x 1 xr xr 1 xn j of x 1 xr degree at most b is invertible mod j we say that j is x 1 xr maximal up to b lemma 4 14 let f k x 1 xr xr 1 xn 0 have x 1 xr degree at most b then there exists a polynomial g k x 1 xr of total degree at most b b n n such that gf k x 1 xr xr 1 xn has total degree at most b 1 b n n proof write f as i i i ti where i i are coprime polynomials in k x 1 xr and ti is a power product in xr 1 xn since f has x 1 xr degree bounded by b each i i and ti has total degree at most b clear denominators and keep track of the degrees by 3 10 there are b n n power products of degree at most b in n variables so f contains at most b n n monomials let g be i i which has total degree at most b b n n it follows that gf i i i i i ti k x 1 xr xr 1 xn and has total degree at most b 1 b n n lemma 4 15 for any d 0 if i is prime up to max b 4 n d d 0 1 d 0 n n then j ik x 1 xr xr 1 xn is x 1 xr prime up to d 0 proof let g h k x 1 xr xr 1 xn each have x 1 xr degree d 0 and suppose gh j by 4 14 there are are g 0 h 0 k x 1 xr such that g 0 g h 0 h k x 1 xn and the total degrees of g 0 g h 0 h are at most d 0 1 d 0 n n by 4 10 g 0 g h 0 h i since g 0 g h 0 h j k x 1 xn and i is prime up to at least b 4 n d since i is also prime up to at least d 0 1 d 0 n n either g 0 g i or h 0 h i showing that either g or h belongs to j lemma 4 16 based on 24 lemma 2 3 let f k x 1 xr xr 1 xn and let the x 1 xr degree of f be at most d 0 where d d 0 for each j r 1 n denote by dj the xj degree of the polynomial wj obtained in 4 11 there exists f k x 1 xr xr 1 xn such that the following hold 1 degxj f dj 2 f f j ik x 1 xr xr 1 xn and 3 the x 1 xr degree of f is bounded by d 0 1 b 1 n d n r 18 william simmons and henry towsner proof the claim follows from successively dividing f by the polynomials wr 1 wn by lemma 4 11 each such wj i k x 1 xr xj j has total degree at most b 1 n d so dj b 1 n d the first division step involving wr 1 at most adds the x 1 xr degrees of f and wr 1 while the xr 1 degree decreases if degxr 1 f is already less than dr 1 we may skip to wr 2 at each step we increase the original x 1 xr degree of f which was at most d 0 by at most b 1 n d and we can continue at most d 0 many times therefore the x 1 xr degree of the remainder after completing division by wr 1 is bounded by d 0 d 0 b 1 n d d 0 1 b 1 n d after dividing by wj the degree of the remainder in xj is less than dj and can never increase thereafter because xj does not appear in wl for r l 6 j the remainder f after considering all n r polynomials wj thus satisfies the first two claims the pattern repeats giving us a bound of d 0 d 0 n r 1 b 1 n d d 0 n r n r 1 b 1 n d n r 1 d 0 b 1 n d n r d 0 1 b 1 n d n r when the process terminates lemma 4 17 based on lemma 2 4 of 24 let f k x 1 xr xr 1 xn with x 1 xr degree d 0 where d d 0 for each j r 1 n denote by dj the xj degree of the polynomial wj obtained in 4 11 there is a monic polynomial f k x 1 xr y such that 1 the y degree of f is at most n j r 1 dj 2 f f j ik x 1 xr xr 1 xn and 3 the x 1 xr degree of f is at most n j r 1 dj d 0 1 b 1 n d n r proof let v 1 vt be power products in xr 1 xn that form a basis of k x 1 xr xr 1 xn mod j by lemma 4 11 t is at most n j r 1 dj by lemma 4 16 for each vi there is a f vi such that for r j n the xj degree of f vi is less than dj fvi f vi j and f vi has x 1 xr degree at most d 0 1 b 1 n d n r so we may write f vi t l 1 ailvl where each ail k x 1 xr has x 1 xr degree at most d 0 1 b 1 n d n r we use the determinant trick consider the t t matrix a y ily ail and note that the determinant of a y is monic and a f must belong to j if v is the column vector with entries vl then ail v fv mod j thus ilf ail v 0 mod j multiply both sides by the adjugate of ilf ail to obtain il det a f v j the power product 1 appears among the vi so det a f j let f det a y then f has y degree at most n j r 1 dj and x 1 xr degree t d 0 1 b 1 n d n r n j r 1 dj d 0 1 b 1 n d n r polynomial bounds in polynomial rings 19 theorem 4 18 based on lemma 2 7 of 24 let d 0 n and let d n j r 1 dj d 0 1 1 b 1 n d n r with dj defined in lemma 4 11 if i is prime up to max b 4 n d d 1 d n n then j ik x 1 xr xr 1 xn is x 1 xr maximal up to d 0 proof suppose we have f k x 1 xr xr 1 xn j with x 1 xr degree d 0 by lemma 4 17 there is a monic f k x 1 xn y with y degree n j r 1 dj and x 1 xr degree at most n j r 1 dj d 0 1 b 1 n d n r so that f f j note that f f has x 1 xr degree at most d 0 n j r 1 dj n j r 1 dj d 0 1 b 1 n d n r n j r 1 dj d 0 1 1 b 1 n d n r d let us write f y m with m maximal so fm f j by lemma 4 15 primality of i up to max b 4 n d d 1 d n n implies x 1 xr primality of j up to d since fm f has x 1 xr degree d and f 6 j we must have f j this also implies that the constant term of y cannot be 0 since y y s s 1 i 1 aiy i a 0 with a 0 6 0 and each ai k x 1 xr we have a 10 f s 1 s 1 i 1 a 10 aif i 1 f 1 j and therefore f is invertible mod j corollary 4 19 let d 0 d i j m be defined as in theorem 4 18 with i be ing prime up to max b 4 n d d 1 d n n if f m k x 1 xr xr 1 xn has total x 1 xr degree less than or equal to d 0 then f j proof if f j then f is invertible mod j because j is x 1 xr maximal up to d 0 by theorem 4 18 but since f m it follows that 1 m contradicting that m is a proper ideal 4 2 2 proof that j m we argue that j m using induction on the number of variables xr 1 xn it is convenient to first treat the case that xr 2 m xn m are separable over k x 1 xr technically the iso morphic copy k x 1 xr m contained in the field k x 1 xr xr 1 xn m theorem 4 21 which is based on theorem 2 8 in 24 contains the heart of the matter lemma 4 20 let m be defined as above and let mj m k x 1 xr xr 1 xj for r 1 j n then mj is a maximal ideal of k x 1 xr xr 1 xj and the field k x 1 xr xr 1 xj mj embeds in k x 1 xr xr 1 xn m proof consider the generators xr 1 m xn m of the field extension k x 1 xr xr 1 xn m over k x 1 xr because each generator is algebraic the k x 1 xr algebra k x 1 xr xr 1 m xj m 20 william simmons and henry towsner is a subfield of k x 1 xr xr 1 xn m the k x 1 xr algebra is isomorphic to k x 1 xr xr 1 xj mj via the obvious map sending xr 1 mj to xr 1 m etc theorem 4 21 based on theorem 2 8 in 24 let i j m be defined as above suppose that i is prime up to b 5 n d 2 d 23 n 2 2 n and xr 2 m xn m are separable over k x 1 xr then for each r 1 j n there exist cr 1 j cj j k x 1 xr hj k x 1 xr y and r 1 j j j k x 1 xr y such that if we define uj cr 1 jxr 1 cr 2 jxr 2 cj jxj and mj m k x 1 xr xr 1 xj 1 uj mj generates k x 1 xr xr 1 xj mj over k x 1 xr 2 hj is the minimal polynomial of uj mj over k x 1 xr 3 hj uj i and xr 1 r 1 j uj xj j j uj all belong to j 4 and the total degrees of cr 1 j cj j k x 1 xr and of hj k x 1 xr y are at most b 5 n d proof we induct on r 1 j n let wj xj be as defined in 4 11 for the base case define cr 1 r 1 1 hr 1 wr 1 y and r 1 r 1 xr 1 wr 1 y clearly ur 1 mr 1 xr 1 mr 1 generates k x 1 xr xr 1 mr 1 over k x 1 xr lemma 4 11 implies that claims 2 and 4 hold for cr 1 r 1 and hr 1 the bounds suffice since the total degree of wr 1 is at most b 1 n d 2 d 2 n b 5 n d claim 3 holds because xr 1 r 1 r 1 ur 1 wr 1 xr 1 i j suppose 1 4 hold for uj cr 1 j cj j hj and r 1 j j j we may also assume that the total degrees of uj and hj are at most 2 d 23 jn 2 j this holds for the base case j r 1 set cr 1 j 1 cj j 1 equal to cr 1 j cj j respectively by 4 20 k x 1 xr xr 1 xj 1 mj 1 is a field extending an isomorphic copy of k x 1 xr xr 1 xj mj from the inductive hypothesis hj is the minimal polynomial of uj mj 1 over k x 1 xr by assumption xj 1 mj 1 is separable and by lemma 4 11 wj 1 is the minimal polynomial of xj 1 mj 1 over k x 1 xr we also know that k x 1 xr is an infinite field and uj mj generates k x 1 xr xr 1 xj mj hence the primitive element theorem 3 2 im plies that there exists cj 1 j 1 k x 1 xr such that cj 1 j 1 has total de gree at most deg hj b 1 n d 1 2 d 23 jn 2 j 2 d 2 n 1 and uj 1 mj 1 uj cj 1 j 1 xj 1 mj 1 generates k x 1 xr xr 1 xj 1 mj 1 over k x 1 xr note that the total degree of uj 1 is at most 2 d 23 jn 2 j 2 d 2 n 1 1 2 d 2 3 jn 2 j 2 d 2 n 2 d 2 3 jn 2 j 2 n because k x 1 xr xr 1 xn j is a finite dimensional k x 1 xr vector space uj 1 is algebraic mod j and hence mod i by theorem 3 25 the set h h k x 1 xr y 0 the total degree of h is at most b 1 n 1 max d deg uj 1 and h uj 1 i is nonempty the total degrees of elements of h are bounded by polynomial bounds in polynomial rings 21 b 1 n 1 max d deg uj 1 b 1 n 1 2 d 23 jn 2 j 2 n 2 2 d 2 3 jn 2 j 2 n 2 n 1 2 d 2 3 jn 2 j 2 n 2 n 1 1 2 d 2 3 jn 2 j n 1 22 n 1 1 2 d 2 3 j 1 n 2 j 1 by the same argument we used in lemma 4 11 there exists some ir reducible hj 1 h by definition of h the total degree of hj 1 is at most 2 d 2 3 j 1 n 2 j 1 b 5 n d since j n primality up to b 5 n d 2 d 2 3 n 2 2 n suffices for each j the bound 2 d 2 3 j 1 n 2 j 1 has the correct form to continue the induction it follows that hj 1 is the minimal polynomial of uj 1 mj 1 over k x 1 xr note that k x 1 xr xr 1 xj 1 mj 1 is isomorphic to k x 1 xr y hj 1 under the map sending uj 1 mj 1 to y hj 1 it remains to define r 1 j 1 j 1 j 1 we start with j 1 j 1 and use it to determine the others consider the polynomial ring k x 1 xr y z the proof of the primitive element theorem 3 2 shows that there exist a b k x 1 xr y z such that z xj 1 mj 1 hj uj 1 mj 1 cj 1 j 1 z a uj 1 mj 1 z wj 1 z b uj 1 mj 1 z this uses the fact that hj and wj 1 are the minimal polynomials of uj mj 1 uj 1 cj 1 j 1 xj 1 mj 1 and xj 1 mj 1 respectively since uj 1 generates k x 1 xr xr 1 xj 1 mod mj 1 there is some polynomial c k x 1 xr y such that xj 1 c uj 1 mj 1 it follows that z c uj 1 mj 1 hj uj 1 mj 1 cj 1 j 1 z a uj 1 mj 1 z wj 1 z b uj 1 mj 1 z by the isomorphism sending uj 1 mj 1 to y hj 1 we have z c y hj y cj 1 j 1 z a y z wj 1 z b y z hj 1 y d y z for some d k x 1 xr y z de fine j 1 j 1 y to be c y and observe that upon substituting xj 1 for z and uj 1 for y we get xj 1 j 1 j 1 uj 1 j by hypothesis xr 1 r 1 j uj xj j j uj j since uj uj 1 cj 1 j 1 xj 1 and xj 1 j 1 j 1 uj 1 j we define l j 1 y to be l j y cj 1 j 1 j 1 j 1 y for r 1 l j this implies that xl l j 1 uj 1 j completing the proof theorem 4 22 let i j m be defined as above suppose i is prime up to b 5 n d and xr 2 m xn m are separable over k x 1 xr then j is a maximal ideal of k x 1 xr xr 1 xn proof we prove that j m by showing for any p k x 1 xr xr 1 xn that if p j then p m j m by definition we use the polynomials un xr 1 r 1 n un xn n n un and hn un from 4 21 by the the orem un mn un m generates the field k x 1 xr xr 1 xn m xr 1 r 1 n un xn n n un all belong to j and hn un i with hn being the minimal polynomial of un m hence we may replace modulo j each xr 1 xn in p with a polynomial in un i e p p 1 un q for some q j and some p 1 k x 1 xr y since p j but hn un i we 22 william simmons and henry towsner know that p 1 un j and the remainder p 2 un from dividing p 1 un by hn un is not zero because p 2 un is a nonzero polynomial of lower degree in un than hn un minimality of hn implies that p 2 un m since p 1 un is equal to p 2 un mod j it follows that p m we now reduce the inseparable case to the separable theorem 4 25 is based on theorems 2 8 and 2 12 in 24 we use induction with the base step depending on 4 22 the inductive step requires a specialization of the faithful flatness results from section 3 1 in lemma 4 23 we continue to use the same field k and ideals i k x 1 xr xr 1 xn and j k x 1 xr xr 1 xn as before lemma 4 23 based on lemma 2 10 of 24 let g k x 1 xr xn have total degree at most b d and let d t 1 tn be a set of power products x ir 1 r 1 xn in with each element of d having total degree at most b suppose there exist t k x 1 xr for each t d such that g t d tt j then there exist t k x 1 xr such that g t d tt j and each t may be written as a ratio of polynomials of total degree at most 2 2 b 2 n d n r n r b 2 r proof considering g and the generators f 1 fs of i as polynomials in k x 1 xr xr 1 xn we may apply theorem 3 5 to conclude that there are gi k x 1 xr xr 1 xn having total degree in xr 1 xn at most 2 b 2 n such that g t d tt s i 1 gifi the monomials in xr 1 xn that appear in the equation have total degree at most 2 b 2 n d by lemma 3 10 there are n 1 2 b 2 n d n r n r power products in xr 1 xn of total degree at most 2 b 2 n d from the k x 1 xr coefficients of the power products of xr 1 xn in g t d tt s i 1 gifi we obtain a system of n 1 many linear equa tions over k x 1 xr whose coefficients have degree at most b theo rem 3 6 implies that the system has solutions in k x 1 xr bounded by 2 2 b 2 n d n r n r b 2 r thus there are t g i k x 1 xr that satisfy the claimed bound such that g t d tt s i 1 g ifi j we are ready to handle the general case to keep track of the bounds we use the following names in theorem 4 25 while b 1 n d b 4 n d and b 5 n d are

least up to b 5 n d by theorem 4 22 we are done unless k has prime characteristic p and at least some of xr 1 xn are inseparable mod m for each r 1 j n let hj y k x 1 xr y be the minimal polynomial of xj mod m if hj happens to be separable define mj to be 0 if hj is inseparable then every exponent of y that appears in hj is divisible by p let mj be the greatest power of p such that p mj divides all exponents of y that appear in hj recall that the polynomial wj xj k x 1 xr xj from lemma 4 11 belongs to i m being a minimal polynomial hj y divides wj y in k x 1 xr y lemma 4 11 then implies that pmj degy hj degy wj dj b 1 n d let h j z k x 1 xr z be the polynomial obtained from hj by re placing y p mj with z note that h j remains irreducible it follows from our choice of mj that not every exponent of z appearing in h j is divisible by p hence h j is the minimal polynomial of x p mj j mod m and x p mj j m is separable over k x 1 xr let m be the greatest of mr 1 mn and consider the polynomial ring k x 1 xr x pm r 1 x pm n observe that m k x 1 xr x pm r 1 x pm n is still maximal if f k x 1 xr x pm r 1 x pm n m then by maxi mality of m there exists g k x 1 xr xr 1 xn such that fg

induction to show that j m for r l n define sl j k x 1 xr xr 1 xl x pm l 1 x pm n and ml m k x 1 xr xr 1 xl x pm l 1 x pm n so mn m k x 1 xr xr 1 xn m as was the case with l r each ml is a maximal ideal of k x 1 xr xr 1 xl x pm l 1 x pm n define the following quotient rings al k x 1 xr xr 1 xl x pm l 1 x pm n sl and bl k x 1 xr xr 1 xl x pm l 1 x pm n ml the previous paragraph established that sr mr the base case of our induction now suppose that sj mj for some r j n in particular aj bj we claim that sj 1 mj 1 note that aj 1 surjects as a ring onto the field bj 1 via the natural map sending sj 1 to mj 1 for k x 1 xr xr 1 xj 1 x pm j 2 x pm n we prove that this map is injective by showing that the vector space dimen sion of bj 1 over bj is greater than or equal to that of aj 1 over the field aj bj this will show that aj 1 bj 1 and sj 1 mj 1 since x pm j 1 mj 1 bj and bj 1 is generated as a field over bj by xj 1 mj 1 bj 1 bj is a purely inseparable extension hence the minimal polynomial of xj 1 mj 1 over bj has the form x p b for some n and b bj in particular the degree of the extension bj 1 bj is p it remains to show that the vector space dimension of aj 1 over aj bj is at most p denote by the minimal natural number such that x p j 1 sj 1 aj note that m let d t 1 sj tn sj be a k x 1 xr basis of aj bj where t 1 tn are representative power products in the variables xr 1 xj x pm j 1 x pm n thus there are t t k x 1 xr such that x p j 1 t d tt m and x p j 1 t d tt j from now on we write t d to refer to any of t 1 tn it follows from 4 11 that we may assume that a power product t d has total degree at most n r b 1 n d as a polynomial in xr 1 xj x pm j 1 x pm n we have p pm b 1 n d so by lemma 4 23 we may assume that the t are ratios of polynomials of total degree at most n 1 2 2 n r b 1 n d 2 n d n r n r n r b 1 n d 2 r if then x p j 1 t d tt j implies that the dimension of aj 1 over aj is at most p hence it suffices to obtain a contradiction from the assumption suppose then that and consider polynomial bounds in polynomial rings 25 x p j 1 t d tt p x p j 1 t d tt t d p t t p t d tt 1 this belongs to mj m k x 1 xr xr 1 xl xj x pm j 1 x pm n which by hypothesis equals sj j k x 1 xr xr 1 xl xj x pm j 1 x pm n by lemma 4 23 we see that for each t d there exist t t k x 1 xr such that tp t d t t t mod sj and t t is a ratio of polynomials hav ing total

theorem 4 26 if i is prime up to b n d then i is prime proof the cases n 1 and d 1 are covered by 4 2 if n d 1 then j k x 1 xn i by 4 10 the ideal j is maximal by 4 25 and restrictions of prime ideals to subrings are prime so i is prime we conclude this section with concrete upper bounds on b n d for each lemma the claimed bound is greater than d so the cases n 1 and d 1 are covered and we may

to b see 4 1 for large enough b then the ideal is maximal similar remarks apply to the following proof and an ultraproduct argument of schoutens 4 1 4 25 as held for theorem 1 1 and schmidt g ttsch s argument mentioned in the introduction the following lemma is a standard step in the proof of the noether nor malization theorem see e g 1 1 8 in 8 lemma 5 1 let f k x 1 xn be a nonzero polynomial of total degree d over a field k there is some c k 0 and a 1 an 1 d 1 n 1 such that the polynomial cf y 1 y a 1 n y 2 y a 2 n yn 1 y an 1 n yn is monic in yn to streamline the main proof we first take care of the simple cases and prove a technical inequality 30 william simmons and henry towsner lemma 5 2 for any field k and any proper ideal i k x 1 xn with generators of degree 1 if i is maximal up to 1 then i is maximal if n 1 and i is proper with generators of degree at most d 1 then maximality up to d suffices proof suppose the generators of i have degree 1 by an invertible affine change of variables we may assume that the generators have the form x 1 xm for some m n such a change of variables preserves our assumption that linear polynomials not in the ideal are invertible modulo the ideal if m n then xm 1 is invertible mod i and xm 1 f 1 i for some f however i x 1 xm cannot have an element with nonzero constant term hence m n and i is maximal in the case n 1 k x 1 is a pid and i f for some f of degree at most d if f 0 then x is not invertible mod i and i is not maximal up to d otherwise reduction by f gives a nonzero remainder of degree less than d for every element of k x 1 i hence maximality up to d implies that i is maximal lemma 5 3 let k n d be natural numbers such that 3 k 1 n and d 1 define d to be 2 d n n 1 n k 2 k 1 n then 2 d n k 1 2 n k 2 2 d n n 1 n k n k 1 2 kn proof applying the definition of d and simplifying we convert the left side of the claimed inequality into 2 n k 1 2 n k 2 2 d n n k 1 2 kn k 2 dividing by 2 d n n k 1 2 kn k 2 and simplifying we see the claimed in equality is equivalent to 2 n k 1 2 n k 2 2 d n n 1 n k n k 1 2 kn 2 kn k 2 2 d n n 1 n k n k 1 2 kn k 2 2 k 2 1 which is clear since k 2 theorem 5 4 define m n d 2 d n 1 n 2 n 2 n for all n 2 d 1 otherwise let m n 1 1 for any n and m 1 d d m 2 d 4 d 4 if d 1 for any field k and any proper ideal i k x 1 xn with generators of total degree at most d if i is maximal up to m n d then i is maximal proof by lemma 5 2 bounds of m n 1 1 and m 1 d d suffice if d 1 or n 1 and d 1 respectively thus we may assume n d 1 by theorem 3 18 b 1 n d 2 d 2 n the noether normalization theorem applied to r k x 1 xn i states that there is an injective homomorphism k z 1 zr r such that r is a finite extension of a polynomial ring k z 1 zr for some polynomial bounds in polynomial rings 31 0 r n the usual proof proceeds by induction on the number of gen erators n of r as a k algebra we reproduce the argument but keep track of bounds along the way our first goal is to show that in our scenario bounded maximality forces r to be 0 toward a contradiction suppose r 0 by maximality up to m n d the ideal i must be nonzero starting with a nonzero generator of degree at most d lemma 5 1 changes variables by substituting yi y ai n for xi if i n and yn for xn using some integers ai d 1 n 1 such that the transformed generator is monic in yn this yields generators of degree at most d 1 n 1 d d 1 n for the ideal i in k y 1 yn generated by the generators of i after substitution the induction continues if there is a nontrivial relation between y 1 yn 1 i e if the elimination ideal obtained by eliminating yn from i is nonzero otherwise zi xi x ai n i for i n gives the claimed map note that xn i is integral over k z 1 xn 1 by hypothesis the process stops after at most n 1 steps leaving us with the desired map for some r 1 and k z 1 zr theorem 3 24 implies that the generators of the elimination ideal are bounded by b 1 n d 1 n after one step of substitution and elimination b 1 n 1 b 1 n d 1 n 1 n 1 after two and so on we analyze the alternating substitution and elimination steps to bound the degrees of representatives of z 1 zr as polynomials in the variables x 1 xn let en d define dn k to be en k 1 1 n k and en k to be 2 dn k en k 1 2 n k 1 for 0 k n by induction dn k is a bound on the degree of a substitution at the k th step and en k is a bound on the degree of the generators after k many steps of substitution and elimination since we seek the degrees of the images of z 1 zr in the original variables and not just the variables in the preceding step our goal is to bound the product n 1 i 1 dn i we eliminate at most n 1 variables lest r 0 note that en k 1 dn k and so en k 2 d 2 n k 2 n k 1 2 dn k 2 n k 2 for all 0 k n it follows that en k 1 2 dn k 1 2 n k 3 and hence dn k 2 dn k 1 2 n k 3 1 n k 22 dn k 1 2 n k 3 n k 2 dn k 1 n k 2 n k 3 for 1 k n it is immediate from the definitions that dn 1 d 1 n 1 2 d n n 1 and a calculation like that of lemma 5 3 shows that dn 2 2 d n n 1 n 2 2 n using lemma 5 3 and the inequality dn k 2 dn k 1 n k 2 n k 3 for in duction on k we find that dn k 2 d n n 1 n k 2 k 1 n for 2 k n the previous sentence establishes the inequality for k 1 2 it follows that k i 1 dn i 2 d kn n 1 n k 2 k 1 n and so z 1 zr can be repre sented by polynomials of degree at most 2 d n 1 n 2 n 2 n in x 1 xn one easily checks that 2 d n 1 n 2 n 2 n m n d for all n d 1 32 william simmons and henry towsner then since i is maximal up to m n d zr is invertible in r zr 6 0 so by injectivity of we know zr i since r is integral over k z 1 zr zr 1 is a root of a monic equation with coefficients in k z 1 zr multiplying the monic equation by an appropriate power of zr shows that zr 1 k z 1 zr whence zr is invertible in k z 1 zr but this is absurd so r is equal to 0 and r is finite over k since r is finite over k for each x 1 xn the restricted ideal i k xi is nonzero by theorem 3 24 there is a nonzero polynomial i xi i k xi of degree at most b 1 n d for each x 1 xn using i to reduce higher powers of xi mod i we see that any f i is equivalent mod i to some f i of total degree at most nb 1 n d m n d for n d 1 by maximality up to m n d f is invertible mod i and hence i is maximal a single formula for the bound easily follows corollary 5 5 m n d 2 d n n 2 n 1 n for all n d 1 references 1 william wells adams and philippe loustaunau an
