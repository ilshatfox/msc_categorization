ideals several of which are closely related to mitchell s notion of strongly proper forc ing we prove 1 presaturation of a normal ideal implies projective antichain catching enabling us to provide a solution to a problem from foreman 8 about ideal projections which is more comprehensive and simpler than the solution obtained in 4 2 we solve an older question from foreman 9 about the relationship between generic hugeness and generic almost hugeness 3 fi nally we provide solutions to two technical questions from foreman 7 and 8 related to his duality theorem 1 introduction foreman s duality theorem is a powerful tool to characterize ideal quotients in many situations mitchell s notion of strongly proper forcing a smaller class than shelah s proper forcing has played an important role in recent years especially because strongly proper forcings don t add new cofinal branches to ground model trees we answer several questions of foreman that turn out to involve both the duality theorem and strongly proper forcing first we address the notions of antichain catching and self generic structures that were introduced in foreman magidor shelah 11 and further utilized bywoodin 16 to prove deep facts about saturated and presaturated ideals suppose z is a set and i is an ideal on the boolean algebra z 1 let bi denote the quotient z i given a regular with bi h and an m h bi we say that m is i self generic 2 iff letting m hm m h be the inverse of the mostowski collapse of m the canonical hm ultrafilter 3 derived from m is generic over hm for the forcing poset 1 m bi lemma 3 46 of 8 proves that the following are equivalent for any normal ideal i that satisfies a common technical criterion 4 1 i is saturated i e bi has a certain chain condition see section 2 3 if z it is the chain

particular this holds for any normal fine ideal on a regular uncountable cardinal 1 http arxiv org abs 1612 01572 v 2 2 sean cox and monroe eskew 2 the set of i self generic submodels of h 22 trcl i constitutes a measure one set in the conditional club filter relative to i 5 cox zeman 4 introduced a property called projective antichain catching for i which is the property obtained by weakening the measure one in part 2 above to the weaker property of being i projective stationary projective antichain catching is in turn closely related to the following question from the handbook of set theory question 1 1 question 13 of foreman 8 suppose that j is an ideal on z n 1 and i is the projected ideal on the projection of z to z n suppose that the canonical homomorphism from z i to z j is a regular embedding 6 is i n 1 saturated cox zeman 4 provided a negative answer to question 1 1 in the case where n 0 and is the successor of a regular cardinal in this paper we provide a more comprehensive negative solution to question 1 1 taking care of all n as well as the case where is the successor of a singular cardinal and with a simpler proof than 4 7 first we prove a general theorem about presaturated normal ideals theorem 1 2 suppose i is a normal presaturated ideal 8 then j has projective antichain catching we will say that a triple n i is a counterexample for question 1 1 iff there exists some ideal j such that the tuple n i j satisfies the assumptions of question 1 1 yet i is not n 1 saturated by the new theorem 1 2 together with a result from 4 see fact 2 22 in section 2 below in order to provide coun terexamples for question 1 1 it suffices to find presaturated nonsaturated ideals if is the successor of a regular cardinal there is a highly modular way to do this theorem 1 3 fix n suppose is regular and n suppose i is a normal n 1 presaturated ideal on n with uniform completeness such that bi cf then there is a cardinal preserving poset p such that letting i denote the ideal generated by i in v p there is some s i such that v p n i s is a counterexample for question 1 1 the proof of theorem 1 3 goes through a technical theorem which generalizes some arguments of baumgartner taylor 2 and makes use of the notion of strong properness see theorem 4 1 in section 4 consider fixed m n with m 1 starting from a model with an almost huge cardinal kunen laver and magidor proved that one can force to obtain a 5 see section 2 6 an embedding from one poset into another is regular if it is order and incompatibility pre serving and pointwise images of maximal antichains remain maximal 7 there is a cost to the simpler proof however cox zeman 4 provided examples of ideals which had projective antichain catching but weren t even strong ideals all ideals in this paper will be presaturated and thus strong 8 the general definition of pre saturation appears in definition 2 13 for an i on some z n as in question 1 1 presaturated means n 1 presaturated and in particular the quotient will be n 1 preserving strongly proper forcing and some problems of foreman 3 model vm n of zfc such that gch holds in vm n and letting m 1 vm n and m vm n vm n there is a n 1 saturated ideal on n whose quotient forces to have cofinality 9 in particular vm n satisfies the assumptions of theorem 1 3 with m and theorem 1 3 yields the following corollary in what follows we have used somewhat unusual notation nm instead of m n in order to make comparison with question 1 1 more obvious corollary 1 4 fix m n with m 1 and let vm n denote the model described in the previous paragraph then there is a cardinal preserving forcing extension of vm n that satisfies there is a normal ideal i on m n m of completeness m such that n m i is a counterexample for question 1 1 in the case where is the successor of a singular cardinal we do not have such a versatile result as theorem 1 3 which would allow us to produce counterexamples starting from an arbitrary saturated or presaturated ideal still we are able to produce counterexamples in these cases as well by a direct construction from large cardinals again we use the unusual notation n 1 instead of 1 n in order to ease the comparison with question 1 1 theorem 1 5 fix n it is consistent relative to a supercompact cardinal with an almost huge cardinal above it that there is a normal ideal i on 1 n 1 of completeness 1 such that i is n 1 1 presaturated but not n 1 1 saturated in this model n 1 i is a counterexample for question 1 1 the methods used to prove theorem 1 3 also allow us to provide a negative answer the following older question question 1 6 foreman 9 page 11 suppose there is an 2 complete precipitous ideal on 3 2 is there an 2 complete 3 saturated ideal on 2 the answer is no even if we strengthen the assumption from precipitousness to a very strong form of presaturation theorem 1 7 it is consistent that there is an 2 complete 3 presaturated ideal on 3 2 yet there are no 2 complete 3 saturated ideals on 2 foreman s duality theorem plays a central role in all of the results above in 7 and 8 foreman proved several partial converses to the duality theorem and also discussed the following scenario suppose j is an ideal in v on some z x and p is a poset let g be v p generic and consider the ideal j generated by j in v g let u be v g bj generic and let u u v z in what scenarios is u generic over v for bj this is the apparent moti vation for part a of his question 1 8 below in what scenarios are g and u mutually generic over v i e when is g u generic over v for the product p bj this is the apparent motivation for part b of his question 1 8 below question 1 8 foreman suppose that j is a normal ideal on z x that p is a x cc partial ordering and that j the ideal generated by j is an x saturated normal ideal in v p is it true that there are a s such that 9 the case m 1 and n 0 is due to kunen 13 the case m 2 and n 0 is due to laver according to 8 and the case n 0 and any m is due to magidor see magidor 14 and theorem 7 43 of 8 4 sean cox and monroe eskew a 7 page 337 the map t 7 1 p t is a regular embedding from bj a p b j s b 8 open question 44 the identity map p t 7 p t is a regular embedding from p bj a p b j s we show that the answer is yes for part a and no for part b we also provide some exact characterizations involving various scenarios where part b has a positive answer which is tightly connected to strong properness see theorem 7 3 theorem 1 2 and the other results related to question 1 1 are due to the first author theorem 1 7 i e the solution to question 1 6 was proved independently by both authors the answer to question 1 8 is due to the second author and theorem 7 3 is due to both authors the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides the relevant background section 3 proves theorem 1 2 section 4 proves theorem 1 3 and its corollaries section 5 proves theorem 1 5 section 6 proves theorem 1 7 section 7 answers question 1 8 and proves some related facts relating question 1 8 to strong proper ness finally section 8 ends with some open questions 2 preliminaries 2 1 forcing preliminaries an embedding e p q between partial orders is called a regular embedding iff e is order and incompatibility preserving and if a is a maximal antichain in p then e a is maximal in q this is equivalent to requiring that for every q q there is a typically non unique pq p such that whenever p pq then e p is compatible with q in q regularity of e is also equivalent to the statement that q e 1 g q is v p generic a closely related concept is that of strong properness introduced by mitchell 15 given a poset p a set m such that m p is a partial order and id m p p is p and p preserving 10 and a condition p p we say that p is an m p strong master condition iff for every p p there is some typically non unique p m m p such that all extensions of p m in m p are compatible with p this is sometimes expressed by saying m p is regular in p below the condition p it is equivalent to requiring that p p g m p is generic over v for the poset m p we say that p is strongly proper with respect to the model m if for all p m p there exists an m p strong master condition below p note that all of these are really statements purely about m p not really about m this has the following easy but very useful consequence lemma 2 1 suppose m n are two sets such that m p n p then for every p p p is an m p strong master condition if and only if p is an n p strong master condition 10 the exact requirements on m vary across the literature but a sufficient condition on m to ensure id m p p has the required properties is for m to be elementary in h for some transitive structure h such that p h strongly proper forcing and some problems of foreman 5 p is strongly proper with respect to m if and only if p is strongly proper with respect to n the following is another key feature of strong master conditions which ordinary master conditions may lack observation 2 2 the statements p is an m p strong master condition and p is strongly proper with respect to m are 0 statements involving the parameters p p and m p corollary 2 3 let v w be two transitive models of set theory suppose m p v and p p then v and w agree on the truth value of the statements p is an m p strong master condition and p is strongly proper with respect to m a nontrivial elementary embedding j v n is called almost huge iff j is definable in v and n is closed under j crit j sequences from v we will use the following theorem of kunen 13 which was generalized by laver for arbitrary regular see 8 theorem 2 4 kunen laver suppose j v n is an almost huge embedding with critical point let be any regular cardinal and n there is a directed closed cc poset p v and a regular embedding e p s j p where s is the p name for the n closed silver collapse that turns j into n 1 moreover e is the identity on p i e e p 1 p for every p p the magidor variation of the kunen construction will be important for the proof of theorem 1 5 if f is a filter on a poset q we write q f to denote the set of conditions in q which are compatible with every member of f with ordering inherited from q theorem 2 5 magidor 14 see also 8 using the same assumptions and nota tions as theorem 2 4 assume that j is a tower embedding that is every element of n is of the form j f j for some j and f v assume g h is v p s generic let g be j p e g h generic over v g h then the map j can be lifted to jg v g n g and if h is generic over v g for the poset jg s jg h then h is generic over n g for the poset jg s and jg can be further lifted to an elementary embedding jg h v g h n g h 2 2 presaturated forcings the notion of a presaturated poset was as far as the authors are aware introduced in baumgartner taylor 2 definition 2 6 we say that a poset p is presaturated iff whenever a is a sized collection of antichains there are densely many p p such that for every a a p is compatible with strictly fewer than many members of a remark 2 7 replacing the word antichains with maximal antichains in def inition 2 6 results in an equivalent definition if is a regular uncountable cardinal and h is a superset of then h denotes all subsets of h of size and h denotes the set of z h such that z for 1 h and h are essentially the same set modulo 6 sean cox and monroe eskew clubs but for 1 they can differ e g in the presence of chang s conjecture see 8 the reason we work with h rather than h will become apparent later in the proof of fact 2 8 we will often use the notion of being proper on a stationary set defined below which implies presaturation given a poset p an m h p for some such that p h and a condition p p recall that p is an m p master condition iff for every dense d m d m is predense below p this is equivalent to the assertion p m g p v m we say that p is proper with respect to m iff for every p m p there exists a p p such that p is an m p master condition if s is a stationary collection of m such that p is proper with respect to m for every m s we say that p is proper on s finally we say that p is proper on a stationary set iff it is proper on s for some stationary set s fact 2 8 if p is proper on a stationary set then it is presaturated proof we actually prove that a weaker property than being proper on a sta tionary set suffices namely suppose for every p p there are stationarily many n h p such that some p p is an n p master condition this can be viewed as a non diagonal version of being proper on a stationary set 11 and is equivalent by proposition 3 2 of foreman magidor 10 to saying that p v is stationary for 1 foreman magidor 10 call such forcings reasonable assume p p and a ai i is a sequence of antichains in p by assumption there is an n h p p a such that n h and there is some p p which is an n p master condition we prove that 1 i r ai r p n since n this will complete the proof fix i since n and n then n so in particular i n and thus ai n 12 extend ai to some a i n which is a maximal antichain suppose for a contradiction that there is some r ai n which is compatible with p then r a i let g be generic with r and p both in g then r is the unique member of g a i since p is an n p master condition and a i n then g n a i 6 but r is not in n and this contradicts that r was the unique member of g a i whether presaturation is even closed under 2 step iterations is apparently open see question 8 6 parts 3 and 4 of the following folklore fact collects several special cases of iterations of presaturated posets that behave nicely and which suffice for our applications fact 2 9 suppose is regular and uncountable then 1 if p is cc and m h p is such that m then 1 p is an m p master condition 11 the latter is diagonal because it requires being able to extend every condition in the model to a master condition for that model 12 this is why we work with h instead of h strongly proper forcing and some problems of foreman 7 2 every closed forcing is proper on a stationary set namely the stationary set ia of m h such that m m and m is internally approachable of length 13 3 any finite iteration of cc and closed posets i e any iteration of the form q 0 q 1 q n where q 0 q 1 q i 1 q i is either cc or closed for every i n is proper on ia and hence by fact 2 8 presaturated 4 any two step iterations of the form proper on a stationary set fol lowed by cc is proper on a stationary set and hence by fact 2 8 presaturated proof to see part 1 given any a m that is a maximal antichain in p the fact that a and m implies a m it follows easily that 1 p m g v m which implies 1 p is a master condition for m part 2 is due to foreman magidor 10 before proving part 3 first note the following routine fact which we leave to the reader a for any poset p and any m h p if ni i witnesses that m ia and g is v p generic then in v g ni g i witnesses that m g ia now return to part 3 suppose m ia is such that m h q using a together with the already proven parts 1 and 2 of the current fact it is routine to show by induction on i that each successive q i is forced by q i to be proper with respect to m g i where g i is the name for the q i generic object it then follows that q i 1 is proper with respect to m to see part 4 suppose p is proper on a stationary set and q is a p name for a cc poset then there is a regular with p q h such that for stationarily many m h p is proper with respect to m fix any such m we show that p q is proper with respect to m given any p q m p q fix a p p that is an m p master condition part 1 of the current fact then implies that p p 1 q is an m g p q master condition and hence so is q then p q is an m p q master condition we will use some other standard facts about presaturation fact 2 10 if is regular and p is presaturated then p cof v cofv g the following is a partial converse to fact 2 10 fact 2 11 baumgartner taylor 2 suppose is a regular uncountable cardinal p is cc and n p cf n v then p is presaturated 13 that is there is some and some increasing and continuous sequence ni i whose union is m and such that n i m for every i 8 sean cox and monroe eskew often especially in applications of foreman s duality theorem section 2 5 one encounters some 2 step iteration p q which has some nice property such as being proper with respect to some models in h and would like to know that p forces that q has a similar property 14 although this works for some natural properties like the cc it can fail for others for example cummings 5 gives an example of a proper 2 step iteration p q such that p forces that q is not proper however the quotients of presaturated posets are well behaved if q is a condition in a poset p and a is a sequence of antichains in p let us make the ad hoc definition that q is good for a iff for every dom a q is compatible with strictly fewer than many members of a so presaturation is equivalent to requiring that whenever a is a length sequence of antichains there are densely many conditions which are good for a lemma 2 12 if is regular and p q is presaturated then p is presaturated and p forces that q is presaturated proof that p is presaturated is routine and we leave it to the interested reader the main content of the lemma is proving the second bullet suppose and p 0 p forces that a a is a sequence of antichains in q that q is a condition in q and that for each q is an enumeration of a we need to find some p p 0 which forces that some condition below q is good for a for let b be a maximal antichain below p 0 of conditions p that decide the value of as some p and let c p q p b and p clearly each c is an antichain by presaturation of p q there is some p 1 q p 0 q such that 2 p 1 q is good for c c the following claim will complete the proof claim 2 12 1 p 1 q is good for a suppose not let p 2 p 1 decide some counterexample i e p 2 forces that q is compatible with at least many members of a since b was a maximal antichain below p 0 there is some p b which is compatible with p 2 let p 3 witness this compatibility then 3 p 3 p q q on the other hand 4 p p 3 q q because otherwise p 3 q would be compatible with at least many members of c contradicting 2 let g be p generic with p 3 g let q q g and q q g for each p in v g let z p q q 14 this occurs e g in the proof of part 2 of theorem 4 1 strongly proper forcing and some problems of foreman 9 since p q is presaturated by assumption then in particular by fact 2 10 it preserves regularity of and hence so does p 15 so is still a regular cardinal in v g since is still a cardinal in v g then 3 and 4 together imply v g z z which is a contradiction this completes the proof of the claim and the lemma 2 3 saturation and presaturation of ideals following the convention of fore man 8 and elsewhere we say that i is an ideal on z to really mean that i is an ideal on the boolean algebra z as pointed out on page 893 of 8 this is an abuse of terminology but we stick with it in order to be consistent with the original wording of questions 1 1 and 1 6 we will exclusively work with fine ideals because it simplifies several issues involving the baggage that ideals carry we say that i is a fine ideal on z if there exists a set x such that z x z 6 i is an ideal on the boolean algebra z 16 and for every x x the following set is in i z z z x z the intended set z must be specified but will often be called the universe of i and denoted univ i if i is a fine ideal on z then the set x as above is computable from i and z as follows let dualz i denote the dual filter of i in z i e all sets of the form z a where a i then 5 x dualz i if i is a fine ideal on z then the set 5 will be called the support of i and denoted by sprt i the support of an ideal provides the indexing set for diagonal intersections and diagonal unions e g the diagonal union of a sequence ax x x of elements of i is the set x xax m z x x m m ax a fine ideal is called normal iff it is closed under diagonal unions some standard examples of normal fine ideals are the set of all nonstationary subsets of a regular uncountable cardinal is a normal ideal on where z x in the notation from above for regular uncountable the set of all nonstationary subsets of is a normal ideal on where z and x in the notation above if i is a fine ideal then its support i e sprt i s where s is any member of i is the relevant indexing set for taking diagonal unions and intersections it follows that if i is normal and fine and a is an antichain of size at most sprt i then a can be disjointed i e there is a collection a of pairwise disjoint i positive sets such that a s i s a see 8 this makes maximal antichains of size sprt i easier to work with 8 has extensive information about disjointing antichains the following general definitions which make sense for any fine ideal agree with all special cases in the literature that the authors are aware of definition 2 13 let i be a fine ideal on a set z we say that i is saturated iff z i has the cc saturated iff i is sprt i saturated 15 actually p is presaturated too but we re not explicitly using that here 16 i e i z i and if a b z are both in i then so is their union 10 sean cox and monroe eskew presaturated iff z i is a presaturated poset as in definition 2 6 presaturated iff i is sprt i presaturated clearly saturation implies presaturation if is a successor cardinal and i is an ideal on whose dual concentrates on 6 x x then generic ultrapowers by i always collapse all cardinals in the interval so saturation presaturation is the best possible in this scenario 17 if the set 6 has measure one for the ideal we will sometimes say that the ideal is of supercompact type in short if i is supercompact type and its completeness is a successor cardinal then sprt i is the best degree of saturation presaturation possible non supercompact type ideals can sometimes have better saturation properties for example magidor showed how to construct for any given n 1 an n 2 saturated n complete normal ideal on n 2 n that is an ideal whose saturation degree is the same as the cardinality of its support 18 the following is standard but because it is central to the proof of theorem 1 2 we briefly sketch the proof for the convenience of the reader lemma 2 14 8 suppose i is a normal fine presaturated ideal with support of size then generic ultrapowers by i are always closed under sequences from the generic extension proof sketch without loss of generality sprt i suppose s i and s forces that f ult v g for each i let ai be an antichain in i which is maximal below s and every condition in ai decides the function which represents f i so for each t ai there is a fi t v such that t f i f i t g jg f i t jg since i is presaturated there is an s s such that for each i s is compatible with at most sprt i many members of ai by pointwise intersecting such members of ai with s we can without loss of generality assume that each ai is a maximal antichain below s and ai normality and fineness of i ensures 19 that any antichain of size sprt i can without loss of generality be assumed to be pairwise disjoint say ai t i and t i t i whenever 6 then one may define hi univ i v such that hi t i fi t i t i for every it is then straightforward to check that s forces jg hi jg f i for every i and that x 7 hi x i represents f in the generic ultrapower if j v n is a generic ultrapower by a normal fine ideal with support h then id g jg h so another way to state the conclusion of lemma 2 14 is that the generic ultrapower is closed under id g length sequences from v g corollary 2 15 assume i is a normal presaturated ideal with uniform complete ness where is a successor cardinal if g is v bi generic and j v g n is the generic ultrapower n is closed under j sequences from v g 17 and is consistent by the skipping cardinals technique of magidor described in 8 18 see the skipping cardinals technique described in 8 it is open whether the 2 in magi dor s theorem can be replaced by 1 see question 8 2 19 by proposition 2 23 of 8 strongly proper forcing and some problems of foreman 11 proof let sprt i and j v g n be as in the hypotheses of the corollary presaturation of i implies 7 v is a cardinal in v g let be the cardinal predecessor of in v then j n and together with 7 this implies that j then any j length sequence of elements of n in v g can be indexed by and it follows from lemma 2 14 that such a sequence is in n we remark that the assumption that is a successor cardinal is necessary for corollary 2 15 for example if u is a normal measure on a cardinal and i is the dual ideal of u then i is 2 saturated and the forcing bi is trivial if j v n is the ultrapower embedding then it is well known that 2 j 2 therefore n is not closed under 2 sequences since it believes j is a cardinal the theory leading to corollary 2 15 in particular the disjointing of antichains seem to require normality of the ideal if the support of the ideal is larger than the completeness for complete uniform ideal on however the normality assumption is not necessary fact 2 16 propositions 2 9 and 2 14 of 8 suppose i is a saturated i e saturated complete uniform ideal on then if u is generic for i and j v n is the generic ultrapower then n is always closed under sequences from v u 2 4 antichain catching and ideal projections the following concept was isolated in foreman magidor shelah 11 definition 2 17 let i be a normal fine ideal in h and m h with i m if a m is a maximal antichain in bi we say that m catches a iff there is some s a m such that m sprt i s we say that m is i self generic iff m catches a for every maximal antichain a m for regular such that i h s i self generic denotes the set of i self generic subsets of h note that we do not place any constraint on the cardinality of i self generic structures we also do not require that m is elementary in h as this would be overly restrictive in the proof of theorem 1 2 the following fact is easy fact 2 18 let i be a normal fine ideal and m be a set such i m m is extensional and m zf the following are equivalent 1 m is i self generic 2 if m hm m is the inverse of the mostowski collapse of m then the following object is a hm 1 m bi generic filter u m i x 1 m univ i m sprt i m x this hm ultrafilter is often called the measure derived from m and sprt i if i is a normal fine ideal there is a weaker notion than self genericity isolated by foreman magidor 10 a model m h i is i good iff m sprt i d for every d m dual i this is equivalent to requiring that the derived u m i from above extends the dual of 1 m i let i 2 univ i 12 sean cox and monroe eskew if i is normal and is sufficiently large then the set s i good of i good structures is always stationary in h burke 3 the conditional club filter relative to i is defined to be the dual filter of ns s i i good moreover if j is the dual of the conditional club filter relative to i then i is a canonical projection of j which implies that the map hi j defined by s i 7 m univ j m univ i s j is a well defined boolean homomorphism from bi bj notice that the collection of i good subsets of h i is a measure one set in the conditional club filter relative to i generalizing the terminology of feng jech 6 a collection s of nonempty sets is called i projective stationary iff for every t i and every algebra a on s there is an m a such that m s and m sprt i t 20 definition 2 19 cox zeman 4 let i be a normal ideal we say that projective antichain catching holds for i abbreviated projcatch i iff the set of i self generic subsets of h i is i projective stationary we say that club antichain catching holds for i abbreviated clubcatch i iff the set of i self generic sub sets of h i constitutes a measure one set in the conditional club filter relative to i equivalently s i i self generic s i i good is nonstationary by standard arguments the definition of projective antichain catching is un changed if we use any large in place of i another intermediate notion called stationary antichain catching was defined in 4 but will be of no use to us here the next fact is just a reformulation of lemma 3 46 from foreman 8 fact 2 20 the following are equivalent for any normal fine ideal i such that sprt i univ i i is saturated clubcatch i holds the key point of projective antichain catching is fact 2 21 cox zeman 4 lemmas 3 4 and 3 11 the following are equivalent for any normal ideal i 1 projectivecatch i 2 there exists a normal ideal j with support containing h i such that j canonically projects to i and the canonical boolean homomorphism from bi into bj is a regular embedding for the reader s convenience we sketch the proof of the forward direction of fact 2 21 which is the only direction that we will use 20 the feng jech notion of projective stationary is the special case when i ns 1 strongly proper forcing and some problems of foreman 13 proof sketch assume projectivecatch i let j be the restriction of the non stationary ideal to the set s i i self generic 21 the assumption projectivecatch i en sures that the map h defined by s i 7 m univ j m univ i s j is a boolean embedding from bi into bj we need to prove that h is a regular embedding so fix a maximal antichain a for bi we view a as a collection of i positive sets rather than a collection of i equivalence classes which should not cause any confusion i e we view h as mapping from the i positive sets into the j positive sets assume r j we need to find some s a such that m sprt i is an element of s for j many m r we can without loss of generality assume that a m for every m r since the universe of j consists only of i self generic structures each m r catches a so there is an sm a m such that m univ i sm by normality of j there is an s a such that sm s for j many m r hence s a and for j many m r m sprt i s which completes the proof fact 2 22 corollary 3 12 of cox zeman 4 suppose i is a normal fine ideal on some z n and that projective antichain catching holds for i then there exists a z n 1 and a normal ideal j on z that canonically projects to i and such that the canonical homomorphism from z i z j is a regular embedding in particular i and j satisfy the assumptions of question 1 1 in order to show the reader how projective antichain catching is related to ques tion 1 1 we sketch the proof of fact 2 22 proof sketch let i 0 i z 0 z and h 0 n by fact 2 21 there exists an ideal i 2 with support h 2 h i that projects to i 0 and the induced homomor phism e 0 2 z 0 i 0 z 2 i 2 is a regular embedding where z 2 is the universe of i 2 so z 2 h 2 since h 2 n 1 then we can canonically project i 2 to an ideal i 1 with support h 1 n 1 and universe z 1 m h 1 m z 2 it follows via routine verification that i 0 is the projection of i 1 to h 0 and that the following maps are well defined boolean homomorphisms for all i j 2 ei j zi ii zj ij defined by s ii 7 m zj m hi s ij moreover it is easy to check that 8 e 0 2 e 1 2 e 0 1 then 8 and regularity of e 0 2 abstractly imply that e 0 1 is regular 21 this j is the same as the restriction of the dual of the conditional club filter to s i i self generic if i happens to be saturated and satisfy the other technical requirement listed in fact 2 20 then the j defined here is in fact equal to the dual of the conditional club filter relative to i 14 sean cox and monroe eskew 2 5 duality theorem suppose w is a model of set theory q is a poset in w and q forces the existence of a w normal ultrafilter u on say it follows that if in w one defines i a q a u then i is a normal ideal and the map e s i 7 js u k is a boolean homomorphism from i ro q in particular the map e is preserving so if q happens to be cc then so is i i e i is a saturated ideal in w this is how the original kunen 13 argument went producing presaturated ideals which are not saturated which is one of the main tools for answering questions 1 1 and 1 6 is more delicate if the poset q from above is merely presaturated then the fact that e is preserving doesn t imply that i is also presaturated for that one typically needs to know that e is a regular embedding for this reason we extensively use the following theorem of foreman if j is an ideal in v and v g is a forcing extension of v we let j denote the ideal generated by j in v g if u is v bj generic then ju denotes the generic ultrapower of v by u if p is a poset and p p then p p denotes the set of all conditions in p which are compatible with p this is forcing equivalent to the cone below p theorem 2 23 duality theorem foreman 7 theorem 17 and corollary 18 suppose j is a normal precipitous ideal u is the bj name for its generic object p is a poset and there is some bj name m for an element of ju p such that the map p 7 1 ju p is a regular embedding from p bj ju p m suppose a bj decides a function f representing m i e f is a function and a bj m f u let s be the p name for the set z a f z g where g is the p name for its generic object then p forces that j is normal and precipitous moreover there exists an iso morphism ro p bj s ro bj a ju p m such that whenever g u is generic for p bj s and u g is the result of transferring g u to a bj a ju p m generic via then u u v z ju v g ult v g u extends ju v ult v u and ju g g it will be convenient to state the special case where p has nice chain condition in such cases m from theorem 2 23 is just the trivial condition and there is no need to restrict below conditions fact 2 24 8 suppose j is a normal precipitous ideal of uniform completeness and p is a cc poset then the map p 7 1 ju p strongly proper forcing and some problems of foreman 15 is a regular embedding from p into bj ju p in particular the assumptions of theorem 2 23 hold and moreover all conclusions of theorem 2 23 hold where a and s are the trivial conditions of their respective posets 3 presaturation implies projective antichain catching in this section we prove theorem 1 2 lemma 3 1 suppose i is a normal ideal and y h i is an i self generic structure define a map fy on y a a is a maximal antichain in bi by letting fy a be an s a such that s y and y sprt i s that is fy a is a set witnessing that y catches a 22 notice that fy can be viewed as a predicate on the underlying set y suppose x y fy and sprt i y x then x is i self generic proof let a x be a maximal antichain for i since x y then a y and thus fy a is defined let s fy a then s x because x y fy since sprt i y x and x y then z x sprt i y sprt i and z s because y is i self generic lemma 3 2 suppose i is a normal ideal g is generic for bi and j v n is the generic ultrapower of v by g fix such that bi h then v g j hv is j i self generic proof since g is v bi generic it is also h v bi generic notice also that j hv is the inverse of the mostowski collapse of j hv that j h v is j i self generic follows immediately by fact 2 18 note that in the proof of lemma 3 2 we were working inside v g not inside n and although j hv h n j the set j h v might fail to be elementary in a hereditary initial segment of v g this is the reason that elementarity of the model was not assumed in the statement of fact 2 18 we now finish the proof of theorem 1 2 suppose i is a normal presaturated ideal fix a sufficiently large regular an algebra a on h and some t i we need to find an i self generic elementary substructure of a whose intersection with sprt i is in t let g be bi generic with t g and let j v n be the generic ultrapower since t g and i is normal then j sprt i id g j t then 9 j hv j sprt i j sprt i id g j t let y j hv by lemma 3 2 from the point of view of v g y is a j i self generic set elementarity of j together with the fact that a is in a countable language guarantees that y j a in particular j a y is a well defined structure on y 22 it is easy to see that there is a unique such witness but that isn t important in the arguments to follow 16 sean cox and monroe eskew work in v g since y is j i self generic we can define a map fy on y a a is a maximal antichain for bj i by letting fy a be a set witnessing that y catches a 23 define the following structure on y 10 b j a y fy fix an x b such that x id g and id g x then x id g y id g and by closure of n under id g sequences from v g we have that x n by lemma 3 1 x is j i self generic in v g which is clearly downward absolute to n in summary x witnesses that n x j a x j sprt i j t and x is j i self generic by elementarity of j v x a x sprt i t and x is i self generic which completes the proof of theorem 1 2 corollary 3 3 suppose i is a presaturated non saturated ideal with support n 24 then i is a counterexample for foreman s question 1 1 in other words there is a normal j with support n 1 which canonically projects to i such that the corresponding boolean embedding from bi bj is a regular embedding yet i is not n 1 saturated proof this follows immediately from theorem 1 2 and fact 2 22 4 proof of theorem 1 3 and its corollaries we prove the following generalization of several results from baumgartner taylor 2 part 2 is stated in a sufficiently general form to be used both for the proof of theorem 1 3 which dealt with supercompact type ideals and for the proof of theorem 1 7 which deals with huge type ideals theorem 4 1 suppose is regular and let then there is a cardinal preserving poset p such that 1 p there are no uniform complete saturated ideals on normal or otherwise 2 suppose is a regular uncountable cardinal i is a normal fine presaturated ideal on some set z 2 z i has uniform completeness z i cf and z i ju where ju is the z i name for the generic ultrapower embedding then whenever g is v p generic letting i denote the ideal generated by i in v g there is some i positive set s such that a i s is not saturated but b i s is presaturated 23 again there is only one such set but this uniqueness isn t important to the argument 24 recall by definition 2 13 this means that i is not n n 1 saturated strongly proper forcing and some problems of foreman 17 the assumption that bi forces j follows automatically in many standard kinds of presaturated ideals for example suppose i is a supercompact type ideal on some where is a successor cardinal 25 then as mentioned in section 2 presaturation is the best possible and in that case the generic ultrapower always sends to also notice that theorem 4 1 in conjunction with corollary 3 3 will imply theorem 1 3 the proof of theorem 4 1 generalizes some arguments of baumgartner taylor 2 which in turn depended heavily on baumgartner s poset for adding a club to 1 with finite conditions this poset doesn t collapse any cardinals and the generic club doesn t contain any infinite set from the ground model it is also in modern terminology a strongly proper poset see section 2 the following generalization is folklore e g is mentioned in abraham shelah 1 we give a slightly different presentation that is more amenable to proving strong properness definition 4 2 let be regular cardinals the poset p consists of pairs s f where s f s and if are both in s then f the ordering is defined by s f s f iff s s and f f whenever s observation 4 3 if v w are transitive models of set theory and v is closed under sequences of length from w then pv pw the following collects the facts we will need about p lemma 4 4 let be a regular cardinals let and let p p from definition 4 2 assume then 1 p in particular p preserves 2 p is directed closed so all cardinals and cofinalities are pre served 3 if m h and m s cof then p is strongly proper for m in particular is preserved in fact for every s f m the object s m f m 7 m is a condition extending s f and is a strong master condition for m 4 if g p is generic over v in v g let cg s f g s then a cg is club in b if x v and x v then x cg 5 p is not cc below any condition 25 recall that by supercompact type we mean that the set x x has i measure one 18 sean cox and monroe eskew proof if then which easily implies part 1 to see part 2 suppose d is a directed subset of p of size let t be the union of all first coordinates of d note that t define a function h on t as follows given a t let d s f d s and define h s f d f we verify that t h is a condition if so then it is clearly below every member of d the assumption that d and the definition of the poset ensures that h for all now suppose are both in t we need to check that h and for that it suffices to prove that f whenever s f d so fix an s f d and fix some s f d witnessing that t i e such that s since d is directed there is some s f below both s f and s f then and are both in s dom f f f because s f s f and f because and are both in s and it follows that f completing the proof of part 2 next we prove part 3 suppose m h m s and that s f is a condition in m since and m h there is some m which is a bijection from since m cof it follows easily that 11 m m since s m then s m and thus m s dom f also if s then f m and again the elementarity of m and the fact that m imply that f m it follows that 12 s m f m m is a condition extending s f if t h extends the condition 12 then tm t m is a sized subset of m and is thus an element of m by 11 also since m t conditionhood of t h implies that h tm maps into m it follows by 11 that tm h tm is an element of m p to show that it is a reduct of t h into m p assume u g is a condition in m p extending tm h tm define a function f on u t by f g if u and f h otherwise it is routine to check that u t f is a condition and extends both u g and t h this completes part 3 for part 4 that cg is cofinal in follows from an easy genericity argument since if s f is a condition and is sufficiently large relative to the range of f then s f is a condition to see that cg is closed let s f be a condition and suppose that 13 s f c g which implies that s we argue that s f is not a limit of c g suppose first that for all s f then s f is a condition contradicting 13 thus there is some s such that f must be the largest element of s and s f forces that is the largest element of cg finally let s f be a condition and let x v be such that x we find an extension of s f forcing that x c g by taking an initial segment of x we strongly proper forcing and some problems of foreman 19 may without loss of generality assume otp x so in particular cf sup x since s and sup x cof s sup x is bounded below sup x if there is some s sup x such that f sup x then s f already forces that c g x is bounded below sup x otherwise we can find a x sup x and define a condition s f extending s f which forces that c g sup x has maximum element x to show part 5 note that for any 1 1 is an antichain if s f is any condition then all members of the above antichain are compatible with s f if is sufficiently large we split the proof of theorem 4 1 into two parts since they are completely independent of each other 4 1 part 1 of theorem 4 1 in this subsection we prove part 1 of theorem 4 1 we roughly follow the outline of the proof of theorem 3 5 of baumgartner taylor 2 assume is regular and let let p p be as in definition 4 2 let g be generic for p and suppose for a contradiction that in v g there exists a complete saturated uniform ideal j on let u be generic for j over v g and j v g ult v g u be the generic ultrapower by u let n ord j v then j p n and ult v g u is of the form n g for some g v g u which is n j p generic then j j v g n g and since j is cc if follows that v g v where the last equality is by part 1 of lemma 4 4 by fact 2 16 n g is closed under sequences in v g u by part 4 of lemma 4 4 c cg has the following properties n g c is club in and x n x n x c 14 since v g u is a cc forcing extension of v there is a d v such that 15 d is club in and d c let e be any subset of d in v such that e v and let sup e notice that fix a v which is a bijection from to then j n by elementarity of j v g n g and it follows that j is the range of j and thus j n also j e n since e v since e j j e e is an element of n as well but e v implies e n since e c this contradicts 14 and completes the proof of part 1 of theorem 4 1 it s natural to wonder if p also forces that there are no saturated ideals on say where the end of the proof above relied on being able to conclude that j sup e is an element of n in this more general setting sup e could be larger than and it would not be clear how to obtain that j sup e n if the ideal is normal then j sup e will be an element of n g but that does not seem to be enough for the proof to go through 20 sean cox and monroe eskew 4 2 part 2 of theorem 4 1 in this section we prove part 2 of theorem 4 1 fix a and i as in the assumptions of part 2 recall the background assumption of theorem 4 1 that and let p p as in definition 4 2 let u be generic for bi over v and j v n the generic ultrapower embedding by the assumptions of part 2 of theorem 4 1 16 cfv u note that p h by part 1 of lemma 4 4 so p genericity over v is equivalent to p genericity over hv in v u consider the object j hv notice that 17 j hv j p j p if the support of i is sufficiently larger than then j hv n which would somewhat simplify the proof below 26 however if the support of i is say then j hv n we give a uniform treatment which works whether or not j hv is an element of n back in v fix some h h p such that h h since p then p h by elementarity of h and the fact that h since h v j h n and since p h j h j p j p together with 17 in particular we have 18 j hv j p j h j p now j h j and 16 implies that cfn then by part 3 of lemma 4 4 applied inside n there is an m j p such that 19 n m is an j h j p strong master condition since n is a transitive submodel of v u corollary 2 3 implies v u m is an j h j p strong master condition then 18 and lemma 2 1 together imply 20 v u m is a j hv j p strong master condition so if g is generic over v u for j p and m g then g j 1 g is generic over hv and thus over v for the poset p hence letting m be a bi name for m the map p 7 1 ju p is a regular embedding from p bi ju p m it follows by the duality theorem theorem 2 23 that in v there is a i and in v g there is an s i such that i s is precipitous and the following forcing equivalence holds 21 p bi s bi a ju p m by part 5 of lemma 4 4 applied inside n the poset ju p m is not j cc 27 which is upwards absolute to v u and it follows by 21 that i s is not saturated in v g 26 namely if j hv n then one would be able to work directly inn to find an j hv j p strong master condition m in n and then simply cite lemma 2 1 to conclude that m is a j hv j p strong master condition from the point of view of v u as well in that scenario there would be no need to use the intermediary set h defined in the next paragraph 27 recall that one of the assumptions of part 2 of the theorem is that j is forced to be equal to strongly proper forcing and some problems of foreman 21 finally we prove that in v g the poset bi s is presaturated as in definition 2 6 by 21 this is equivalent to showing that bi a ju p m is presaturated in v g and by lemma 2 12 it in turn suffices to prove that 22 v bi ju p is presaturated in some situations where the structure of bi is better known 22 can be proved directly for example if we had assumed that in v bi is proper on a stationary set of internally approachable structures then one could use arguments from section 2 to to prove 22 directly we also do not know if presaturation is closed under 2 step iterations in general see question 8 6 if so then again one could prove 22 directly however the hypotheses of theorem 4 1 do not specify the structure of bi nor any forcing theoretic properties beyond presaturation so in the absence of a positive solution to question 8 6 we must rely instead on some other facts from section 2 in order to prove 22 claim 4 4 1 v g n bi s cf n v g proof of claim 4 4 1 by 21 and the fact that p preserves all cardinals it suffices to prove that over v the poset bi ju p m forces that cf n v for all n the first step bi is presaturated by assumption so by fact 2 10 it forces cf n v for all n now consider the second step if u is v bi generic and j v u n is the generic ultrapower then corollary 2 15 and observation 4 3 ensure that 23 j p pn j pv u j so by part 3 of lemma 4 4 applied inside v u j p is strongly proper with respect to stationarily many models in h v u thus j p is presaturated in v u by fact 2 8 finally by fact 2 10 it follows that v u j p n cf n v u the assumption that 2 z held in the ground model is clearly preserved in the extension v g because p and preserves all cardinals so v g bi these facts together with claim 4 4 1 and fact 2 11 imply that i s is presaturated in v g 5 proof of theorem 1 5 unlike the case with successors of regular cardinals if is the successor of a singular cardinal we do not have a way to turn an arbitrary saturated ideal of completeness into a presaturated nonsaturated ideal even in presence of gch that is we do not have an analogue of theorem 4 1 in this context however we can construct such an ideal directly which will prove theorem 1 5 and thus provide a counterexample for question 1 1 in the successor of a singular context we want for any fixed n to construct a model with an ideal on 1 n 1 which is n 1 1 presaturated but not n 1 1 saturated foreman 9 produced 22 sean cox and monroe eskew a model with an 1 saturated ideal on 1 and the skipping cardinals tech nique of magidor 14 also described in section 7 9 of 8 allows one to extend foreman s method to produce an n 1 1 saturated ideal on 1 n 1 for any fixed n however it s not clear if one can start from that model and then force to kill the n 1 1 saturation while preserving the n 1 1 presaturation to get around this issue we consider a different ideal in that very same model which already is n 1 1 presaturated and not n 1 1 saturated this intro duces some complications because while saturation is preserved downward by any preserving embedding e g any boolean embedding arising from an ideal projection presaturation is not to preserve presaturation downward one must generally arrange that the embeddings are regular embeddings rather than merely being preserving assume gch is indestructibly supercompact and is an almost huge cardinal and let j v n be an almost huge tower embedding witnessing the almost hugeness of that is j is an almost huge embedding and letting j every element of n is of the form 24 j f j where and f v 28 by the kunen laver theorem 2 4 there is a directed closed cc poset p v and a regular embedding e p s j p is a regular embedding where e is the identity on p and s is the p name for the n closed silver collapse to turn into n 1 let g h be v p s generic suppose g is generic over v g h for j p g h in v g the map j can be extended to jg v g n g due to the cc of p let jg s jg h denote the set of conditions in jg s which are compatible with every member of jg h with ordering inherited from jg s by magidor s theorem 2 5 if h is generic over v g for jg s jg h then h is generic overn g for jg s and in v g h the map jg can be further extended to jg h v g h n g h recall that j was a tower embedding in the ground model it follows easily that jg h is also a tower embedding by a tower of height but since is a successor cardinal in v g h namely n 1 then actually we have that jg h is an ultrapower embedding by a normal measure claim 5 0 1 the map jg h is an ultrapower map by a v g h normal measure on n v g h that is every element of n g h is of the form jg h f j n for some f v g h with f p n v g h 28 see 14 for details on almost huge tower embeddings strongly proper forcing and some problems of foreman 23 proof of claim 5 0 1 since everything in n has the form 24 then an arbitrary element y of n g h has the form j f j g h for some and f v in v g h define f on by letting f z f z g h if f z is a p s name and undefined otherwise note that the form for y above together with elementarity of jg h imply in particular that 25 jg h f j y since n 1 in v g h then in v g h there is some surjection n an easy calculation using surjectivity of and elementarity of jg h shows 26 j jg h jg h j n where the first equality is because jg h extends j in v g h define a function f on n by f u f u then jg h f j n jg h f jg h j n jg h f j y where the next to last equality is by 26 thus in v g h the name for the generic embedding jg h induces a normal ideal i on n by a minor modification of the proof of the duality theorem theorem 2 23 the following forcing equivalence holds in v g h 27 n i j p g h jg s jg h the poset j p g h is n 1 cc in v g h and forces that jg s jg h is closed and not cc so by 27 and fact 2 8 we have 28 v g h bi is proper on a stationary set but not saturated since p s is directed closed and was indestructibly supercompact in the ground model then is still supercompact in v g h set w v g h and work in w for the remainder of the proof let r be the prikry forcing with a guiding generic to turn into see section 2 of 17 this forcing adds a cofinal sequence to while collapsing cardinals in between the members of the sequence and preserving that is a cardinal conditions in the forcing take the form s a where s v and any collection of many conditions with the same first coordinate have a common extension with the same first coordinate therefore r can be expressed in the form r f where each f is a filter it follows that if u is generic over w for bi and j w w is the generic ultrapower then j f is a sequence of j many filters whose union is j r this is upward absolute to w u and in particular 29 w u j r is j cc 24 sean cox and monroe eskew it follows by fact 2 24 applied from the point of view of the model w that i is forced by r to be precipitous and that the following forcing equivalence holds in w 30 r bi bi ju r s in w consider the 2 step poset s on the right side of 30 by 28 the first step is proper on a stationary set and by 29 the second step is forced to be cc by fact 2 9 s is proper on a stationary set and in particular presaturated by fact 2 8 it follows by 30 and lemma 2 12 that if k is w r generic then w k bi is presaturated finally the equivalence above yields that 31 w k bi bi ju r gr recall from 28 that bi wasn t cc in w it follows by 31 that bi isn t cc in w k in summary w k satisfies that n 1 and i is a presaturated non saturated ideal on n where 1 by corollary 3 3 w k satisfies that n 1 i is a counterexample for question 1 1 6 proof of theorem 1 7 in this section we use both parts of theorem 4 1 to prove theorem 1 7 providing a negative answer to foreman s question 1 6 first we need a theorem implicit in kunen 13 29 foreman gives a stronger version as theorem 7 70 in 8 theorem 6 1 kunen laver if are regular is a huge cardinal and gch holds then there is a closed forcing extension w that satisfies gch there is a complete normal fine presaturated ideal j the forcing bj is in fact of the form cc followed by closed and thus presaturated by fact 2 8 fix a universe w as in the conclusion of theorem 6 1 30 let p pw from definition 4 2 let g be w p generic by part 1 of theorem 4 1 there are no complete saturated ideals on in w g let j be the ideal generated by j in w g by part 2 of theorem 4 1 taking w there is some s i such that i s is presaturated this completes the proof of theorem 1 7 7 foreman s questions on regular embeddings in this section we answer question 1 8 part a affirmatively and part b nega tively we also prove several theorems demonstrating the close relationship between strong properness and part b of question 1 8 29 kunen proved how to do this for ideals on 1 and laver observed that it can be generalized to larger cardinals see 8 30 to answer question 1 6 we just take 1 strongly proper forcing and some problems of foreman 25 lemma 7 1 answering question 1 8 part a suppose that j is a normal ideal on z x that p is a x cc partial ordering and that j is a x saturated normal ideal in v p then the map id z j p z j given by a j 7 1 a j is a regular embedding proof the map id is clearly an order and antichain preserving map since p j j so j is saturated let g h be p z j generic over v since j is saturated in v g there is an elementary embedding j v g n v g h where n is transitive we claim that for all a z v 32 a j iff p bj j x j a if a j then p a j and since j is forced to be normal it is forced that id j x j a if a j then p a j and thus there is an extension in which id j x j a since j is saturated every antichain has size at most x let ax x x be a maximal antichain in bj then x xax dual j so it is forced that j x j x xax in other words it is forced that for some x x id j ax if 1 a x j x x were not a maximal antichain in p z j then there would be some p b incompatible with all 1 a x if g h is generic with p b g h then we would have a generic embedding j such that id j ax for any x x a contradiction the remainder of this section is related to part b of question 1 8 definition 7 2 suppose p is a partial order j is a normal ideal and is a sufficiently large regular cardinal let f be the conditional club filter relative to j see section 2 we will say that p is j strongly proper if m h p is strongly proper with respect to m f we remark that if j ns 1 then j strong properness is equivalent to the usual strong properness see section 2 1 this is because for 2 1 every countable m h is ns 1 good and so the conditional club filter relative to ns 1 is simply the club filter on the collection of all countable m h ns 1 theorem 7 3 suppose that j is a normal precipitous ideal on z x and p is a partial ordering with p x the following are equivalent 1 p is j strongly proper 2 for a dense set of p a p bj there is a p name s for an element of j such that a the map q t 7 q t is a regular embedding from p p bj a p p b j s b there exists a bj name m such that the triple a s m satisfies the assumptions of theorem 2 23 31 moreover if p is cc and j is complete then part 2 b is redundant i e part 2 b already follows from part 2 a 31 i e a j m is a bj name for a condition in ju p p such that q 7 1 j u q is a regular embedding from p p bj ju p p m there is an f v such that a j m f u and s is the p name for z a f z g where g is the p name for its generic object 26 sean cox and monroe eskew proof 1 2 assume p is j strongly proper and let p 0 a 0 p bj be arbitrary claim 7 3 1 there is some bj name m such that 1 m ju p 0 and 1 m bj ju p j 1 u g u is generic over v for p bj proof of claim 7 3 1 fix a x and an h h x z j p such that x p h and h x this is possible by the assumption that p x let u be v bj generic and ju v nu the generic ultrapower since h x sprt j and j is normal ju h nu also notice that since p h ju h ju p ju p if d h dual j then genericity of u implies ju x ju d and since x h it follows that ju x ju h ju x thus nu ju h is ju j good so by our assumption nu models that ju p is strongly proper with respect to ju h by corollary 2 3 this holds from the point of view of v u as well work in v u let m be any ju h ju p strong master condition below ju p 0 then if g is generic over v u for ju p with m g then g ju h g ju p is generic over v u for ju p since ju is an isomorphism from p ju p it follows that j 1 u g is v u p generic so by the product lemma j 1 u g u is v p bj generic letting m be a bj name for this m this completes the proof of the claim for some p p 0 it is forced by bj that for all q p ju q is compatible with m since otherwise the set of q for which this fails is dense below p 0 contradicting claim 7 3 1 therefore we have that q 7 1 ju q is an embedding from p p into bj ju p p m it is regular because by claim 7 3 1 bj ju p p m forces the inverse image of the generic under this map to be p generic over v which is one of the several characterizations of regular embeddings in section 2 1 pick a j a 0 that decides a representation of m i e a j forces m f u for some f v and define s to be the p name for z a f z g then a m and s are as in the assumptions of theorem 2 23 let be the isomorphism from the conclusion of theorem 2 23 now assumeg u is an arbitrary v p p b j s generic filter and let 33 u u v z to finish the 1 2 direction of the proof we need to show that g u is generic over v for p bj if w g is the bj ju p generic obtained by transferring g u via then theorem 2 23 implies that w v z u so by 33 it follows that u w again by theorem 2 23 ju extends ju and g j 1 u g by claim 7 3 1 v u g g u is v p bj generic which completes the 1 2 direction of the proof 2 1 suppose for a contradiction that p is not j strongly proper then if h is the support of the conditional club filter relative to j there is a stationary set b of j good models such that for all m b there is p m which cannot be extended to an m p strong master condition by pressing down there is a stationary b b and a p 0 p such that for all m b p 0 m and p 0 cannot be extended to an m p strong master condition this implies that p p 0 is not j strongly proper strongly proper forcing and some problems of foreman 27 fix a wellorder of h and let a h x z p j let t be the projection of b to z t m x m b and note t j 32 we claim that for every m a such that p 0 m and m x t p 0 cannot be extended to an m p strong master condition this is because for such m there is n b with n x m x and thus n p m p since p 0 cannot be extended to an n p strong master condition the claim follows from corollary 2 1 fix an h a with x h and h x notice that p h too let p a s be a witness to 2 with p p 0 and a t let u be v bj generic with a u and ju v nu the generic ultrapower since a u we have ju x ju a and because x h it follows that ju h ju x ju x ju a ju t and ju h is easily seen to be ju j good and elementary in ju a by elementarity nu ju p cannot be extended to a ju h ju p strong master condition 34 let g be generic over v u for p p then by the product lemma g u is generic over v for p p bj a by assumption about the regularity of the identity map we can force over v g u with the quotient p p b j s g u let g u be generic for this quotient since this is the quotient by the identity map we have 35 u u v z assumption 2 b ensures that theorem 2 23 is applicable let be the isomor phism from theorem 2 23 and letw g be the generic for z j ju p obtained by transferring g u via by theorem 2 23 we have w u v z so by 35 it follows that u w theorem 2 23 further tells us that ult v g u is of the form nu g ju extends ju and ju g g in particular ju p g because g u was chosen to be generic over v for p bj the product lemma implies that g is v u p generic and hence nu p generic since ju p is an isomorphism from p to ju p this is equivalent to saying that 36 g ju p g ju h ju p is nu ju h ju p generic since ju p g then by the forcing theorem there is some p g with p ju p such that 37 p nu ju p g ju h is nu ju h ju p generic where g is the ju p name for its generic object but this implies that p is a ju h ju p strong master condition and since p ju p this contradicts 34 it remains to justify the moreover part of the theorem suppose p is cc and j is complete then fact 2 24 implies that the triple a a ju p satisfies the 32 to see this since b is stationary there is an n b with n h t j if t were in j then by j goodness of n n x would be in the complement of t which is a contradiction to the definition of t and the fact that n b 28 sean cox and monroe eskew assumptions of theorem 2 23 the regularity of the map p t 7 p t implies that p a dual j s in other words p s j a if t is a tree of uncountable regular height the forcing to specialize t with finite conditions refers to the set of finite functions f t such that whenever t t t are both in dom f then f t 6 f t ordered by reverse inclusion lemma 7 4 suppose is regular p is a partial order preserving the regularity of t is a p name for a aronszajn tree and q is a p name for the forcing to specialize t with finite conditions then p q is not j strongly proper for any normal ideal j of uniform completeness proof it suffices to prove that if m h p t and m then no condition in p q can force that m g h is generic for m p q over v let g p be generic over v if m g is not v m p generic we are done otherwise m m m g since the levels of t have size s t levt s m t m g let t be a node of t at level m and let b s t s t t let h q be generic over v g and suppose for a contradiction that h m g is m g q generic over v g a simple density argument shows that for all n there is s b and q h such that q s n however q s 6 q t for any q h and s b corollary 7 5 providing negative answer to question 1 8 part b suppose there is a saturated normal ideal j on then there is a cc partial order p that preserves the saturation of j and is such that there do not exist a s such that the map p t j 7 p t j is a regular embedding from p z j a p z j s proof if we force with col then becomes 1 and by 12 there exists a special aronszajn tree t in the extension let t be a name for such a tree and let p col q where q is the forcing to redundantly specialize t with finite conditions since t is forced to be special p is cc in any outer model where is still a regular cardinal see 12 lemma 16 18 fact 2 24 implies that 38 p j j j p if j v g n is a generic ultrapower by some generic g z j and g col is generic over v g then we can extend j to j v g n g because j t is special in n g this is upwards absolute to v g g also since j is saturated j is a regular cardinal in v g g in particular v g g models that j t is a j aronszajn tree and hence that the forcing to specialize it which is correctly computed by n g i e the poset j q is j cc together with 38 this implies that p forces j to be saturated notice that p sprt j if there were some a j and s as in the statement of the current corollary then by theorem 7 3 p would be j a strongly proper which would contradict lemma 7 4 8 questions in light of our negative solution to question 1 6 the following seems a natural attempt to salvage the original question strongly proper forcing and some problems of foreman 29 question 8 1 suppose there is a normal fine 2 complete 3 presaturated ideal on 3 2 must there exist a presaturated ideal on 2 we remark that the model we used to give a negative answer to question 1 6 does not give a negative answer to question 8 1 because the model in the conclusion of theorem 6 1 also has a saturated ideal on which generates a presaturated ideal in the extension by p we also remark that if all instances of presaturated are replaced by saturated in question 8 1 then the answer is yes 33 however it is not known if the resulting hypotheses of that revised question are even consistent so we include that question as well question 8 2 fix n 1 can there exist a normal fine n complete n 1 saturated ideal on n 1 n we note that if question 8 2 has a positive answer for n 2 this would yield a positive answer to question 31 of foreman 8 regarding saturated ideals on 2 which are indestructible by 2 cc forcing 34 theorem 4 1 generalized baumgartner taylor 2 by showing that under certain cardinal arithmetic assumptions if is the successor of a regular cardinal then there is a cardinal preserving poset which 1 preserves presaturation below some positive set of all presaturated normal ideals of completeness yet kills their saturation if they had it to begin with and 2 forces that there are no saturated ideals on in the extension combined with theorem 1 2 this allows one to start for example with an arbitrary saturated ideal on a successor of a regular cardinal and force to kill its saturation but preserve its presaturation below some condition the following questions ask if theorem 4 1 can be further generalized in several ways question 8 3 assume gch and fix regular uncountable cardinals assume is the successor of a regular cardinal is there a cardinal preserving poset which preserves presaturation of any presaturated normal ideal on yet forces that there are no saturated ideals on in the extension question 8 4 can theorem 4 1 at least of part 2 of that theorem be generalized to cases where is the successor of a singular cardinal question 8 5 can theorem 4 1 at least of part 2 of that theorem be generalized to cases where is inaccessible the following forcing theoretic question seems to be open and a positive answer would allow for the removal of the assumption 2 z from the hypotheses of part 2 of theorem 4 1 question 8 6 suppose is regular and p q is a 2 step iteration of presaturated posets must p q be presaturated 33 suppose j is a normal fine 2 complete 3 saturated ideal on 3 2 let i be its projec tion to an ideal on 2 and e bi bj the induced boolean embedding since e is preserving and bj is 3 cc then bi is 3 cc as well 34 via the proof of corollary 27 of foreman 9 30 sean cox and monroe eskew note that by fact 2 11 any counterexample would have to have size at least and by the proof of fact 2 8 would have to kill the stationarity of the ground model s for some references 1 uri abraham and saharon shelah forcing closed unbounded
