erkki luuk a type theoretical approach to universal grammar abstract the idea of universal grammar ug as the hypothetical linguistic structure shared by all human languages harkens back at least to the 13 th century the best known modern elaborations of the idea are due to chomsky following a devastating critique from theoretical typological and field linguistics these elaborations the idea of ug itself and the more general idea of language universals stand untenable and are largely abandoned the proposal tackles the hypothetical contents of ug using dependent and polymorphic type theory in a framework very different from the chomskyan ones we introduce a type logic for a precise universal and parsimonious representation of natural language morphosyntax and compositional semantics the logic handles grammatical ambiguity with polymorphic types selectional restrictions and diverse kinds of anaphora with dependent types and features a partly universal set of morphosyntactic types by the curry howard isomorphism 1 introduction although the idea of universal grammar ug harkens back to at least roger bacon cf ranta 2006 the modern version of the hypothesis is usually credited to chomsky e g 1970 1981 1995 in modern times the notion of ug has taken several forms a substantive diluted and implicational one chomsky 1981 jackendoff 2002 greenberg 1966 resp however a logical derivational path from implicational universals structural traits implying other structural traits to functional dependencies to substantive universals has been overlooked the present paper tries to unveil this possibility in the form of a direct type theoretical account of substantive universals as logical formulas from the present viewpoint type theory is essential for a logical specification of ug first in its modern form i e as dependent and or polymorphic type theory it is the most expressive logical system contrasted with the nonlogical ones such as set and category theory in a logical approach i e in one with simpler alternatives such as zol fol sol and hol complex type theories outshine simpler ones in accounting for phenomena like anaphora selectional restrictions etc asher 2014 luo 2010 2014 ranta 1994 second as the notion of type is inherently semantic 1 type category of semantic value it is by definition suited for analyzing universal phenomena in natural language nl as nl semantics in largely universal as witnessed by the possibility of translation from any human language to another thus if one could build a fundamentally semantic description of grammar e g one on top of and integrated with a semantically universal description of nl it would at least stand a chance of being universal the paper will proceed as follows after a brief overview we introduce a simple logic say l matching nl morphosyntax as closely as possible the purpose of l is to express the universal core of nl morphosyntax in a formally and linguistically precise yet parsimonious way in the second part l is furnished with elementary and complex morphosyntactic types some of which are universal others nonuniversal or possibly universal the third part gives additional explanations examples and rules situating l within dependent and polymorphic type theory along the way with martin l f s type theory mltt martin l f 1984 as the main type theoretical reference point institute of computer science university of tartu estonia email erkkil gmail com 1 2 preliminaries returning to modern notions of ug there are then three to consider some of which are not mutually exclusive one of an innate language acquisition device lad the second of implicational universals and the third of the hypothetical linguistic structure shared by all human languages the details of implicational universals imply a larger than singleton set of universal grammars so the second notion is irrelevant if one insists as we do on a single ug thus we have two alternatives the lad which can be termed weak and the substantive universals that amount to a strong ug an even stronger version can be constructed by the condition the linguistic structure shared by all possible human languages however we only indicate this possibility here and speak of a strong ug in the more lax sense henceforth while the very fact that normal human infants acquire nl without an explicit supervision seen as disjoint from normal exposition to linguistic stimuli is an evidence for a lad an evidence for substantive universals is much more contentious more recently the strong version of the hypothesis having suffered heavy blows from the sides of both linguistic theory e g jackendoff 2002 and comparative typological evidence e g evans and levinson 2009 has been severely discredited and at least partly demolished and abandoned in this paper we use dependent and polymorphic type theory to set up a credible case for a strong ug resulting in a framework very different from chomskyan ones in a sense our approach will be more formal secondly the usual although frequently implicit and perhaps even inessential chomskyan notion of syntax as grammar will be supplanted by morphosyntax as grammar where moreover morphosyntax will be fundamentally semantical in nature but let us start by introducing some key concepts in a nutshell the picture is as follows mathematically speaking there are relations with arities and associated arguments some relations their arguments and the resulting formulas correspond to morphosyntactic constituents by a morphosyntactic constituent we mean a well formed abbreviated wf formula abbr wff of a nl expression for example in 2 the man 3 run the y man 4 y love mary john 5 man the 6 m the an 2 4 are wf formulas of the man the men run and john loves mary resp while 5 6 are ill formed 6 is already a notational gibberish 2 4 make use of the following conventions 7 complex formulas are written in prefix notation a b or a b with a standing for a relation and b for its argument s 8 0 th order relations 1 st order arguments in small letters all other relations in capitals 9 inside out and right to left valuation or derivation inside out has precedence over right to left 10 argument derivation order sod subject object ditransitive object otherwise linear y is a tense person number etc marker we will make a precise sense of this term later by 8 we see that the man is expressed as a first order formula to keep the representation in close correspondence with nl we avoid extralinguistic and theory specific features such as the model theoretic variable x in the man x in many cases as in this one such features can be added later if a specific extralinguistic interpretation is desired by 7 9 we get john loves mary rather than vice versa for 4 and the person number relation marker s will apply to love rather than to love mary john the ungrammatical or incomplete english expression john love mary by 10 arguments are derived in the order subject object ditransitive object if they have these values and 2 in their linear order in the nl expression if not by 9 this will specify tuples d o s or 3 rd 2 nd 1 st resp cf 17 our vocabulary consists of elementary relation symbols commas and matching parentheses there are now two sensible possibilities 11 for a particular language the symbols are type constants cross linguistically they are type variables e g man valuates to man in english and homme in french 12 the symbols are type constants inhabited by language particular proof objects e g the type man has objects man homme etc notice that 12 is more universal not only linguistically but already type theoretically by identifying formulae with types and proofs more precisely proof objects with terms or objects by the curry howard isomorphism 1 elementary relation symbols can be composed into well formed relation formulas henceforth usually just formulas or wffs we also assume 13 all elementary relation symbols are atomic formulas and all formulas signify relations 14 a wff is wf both syntactically and semantically i e wf and well typed cf section 7 formulas are morphosyntactic types that have semantics by 1 our maximal and default universe of morphosyntactic types will be denoted u in u all formulas are morphosyntactic types and all types are morphosyntactic formulas later we will also consider other universes e g rel and arg types of morphosyntactic relations and arguments resp 3 discussion this seemingly rather rudimentary representation bears some remarkable features first it can capture certain aspects of syntax morphology as well as semantics moreover it manages to do so without a cumbersome graphical representation e g trees all words and morphemes even those fused with stems like the plural marker in men have meaning i e semantics hence the representation is compositional in both morphosyntactic and semantic respects the exact nature of the compositionality will be made more precise later for example y is a morphological although perhaps also a syntactic category in english obviously one could make it more precise by substituting y with 3 sg third person singular in 4 the main reason for us not doing so is a tradeoff between such precision and universality for most languages the representation partially captures even information structure and word order the general principles 15 argument terms must be derived before the relation terms they are arguments of 16 arguments depend on relations but the proof of a relation i e relation term depends on proofs of its arguments argument terms have ramifications for both information structure and word order principles 7 9 15 imply that arguments tend to be on the right and relations on the left this order is reversed in the linear order of writing and speech preceding and succeeding in writing and speech correspond to on the right and left in the notation resp 1 it is also more universal in a general sense as function is a subcase of relation functions are certain sets of pairs relations are all sets of n tuples for any constant n 3 the fact that l may be relational as well as functional depending on the choice between 11 12 capital letter formulas may stand for relation or function symbols is noteworthy as well besides being largely interdefinable both variants have their own merits broadly speaking generality for relational and specificity for functional logic see oppenheimer and zalta 2011 in addition if one prefers a functional interpretation s he must choose between different potentially relevant function types notably between truth functions and those valuating to linguistic expressions for example if one interprets 4 as truth functional any further morphosyntactic compositionality as evident in e g john loves mary and vice versa would be barred as one would be left with only a truth value after valuating john loves mary compositional truth functional semantics would still be attainable with standard logical operators or not etc though since the arguments of truth functions may be expression functions but generally not vice versa a truth functional interpretation can be composed with an expression functional one but generally not vice versa so it is desirable to refrain from truth functionality for generality of one s logic 4 specifying formulas deriving expressions let us agree on some terminology 17 l nl specification formula expression derivation we specify l s formulas from nl expressions and derive nl expressions from l s formulas the derivation is not a function to nl as such however it should be a function to particular nls the precise character of this function remains open an obvious goal is to make specification a function 2 if successful its possible injectivity would be another open question although we do not have any functions yet we will demonstrate an algorithm this is neither a specification nor a derivation algorithm which we presently cannot have only one deciding a derivation s correctness however we can say something about the desired derivation algorithm as well for the algorithm to consistently derive all and only the relevant well typed expressions it should adhere to the principles of 18 serial and incremental derivation of sentences deriving one expression per stage using all previously derived expressions 19 deriving a well typed result at all stages of derivation 20 inhabiting as many complex subformulas of the endformula as possible 21 18 having precedence over 9 intuitively 15 18 19 could be viewed as following from frege s principle of compositionality this aside they are stipulated for simplicity and wellordering see section 11 3 20 is a metric of the quality of the algorithm by 18 some complex expressions may have to be assumed rather than derived i e require a separate derivation by a stage of derivation we mean by 11 the value or by 12 the proof object or term of a type i e a linguistic expression for example the derivation from the man is 2 staged with the first deriving man and second the man we will write the derivation man the man or m tm in the abbreviated form consider now the following hypothetical logical forms of i know the man who was ill 2 since l s formulas depend on nl they cannot be specified mechanically with an inductive definition similarly derivation is incomplete due to e g language particular word order constraints 4 22 know who y be ill the man i 23 know who y be ill the man i 24 know who ill y be the man i 25 know who y be ill the man i 26 know who y be ill the man i 27 y ill be who know the man i 28 y ill be who know the man i 29 y ill be who know the man i 30 know the man i ill y be who 31 know the man i y ill be who 32 know the man i y ill be who since 32 is not a formula by 7 it is immediately disqualified the subformula y ill be who is not in brackets i e not composed with know the man i likewise 30 31 are not formulas by 9 the man i must be applied to the relation on its right before applying know to the man i but the latter a 2 tuple of arguments is not a formula so 30 31 are not formulas 26 is disqualified by 19 by deriving the ill typed the man ill on the 3 rd stage similarly 25 derives the ill typed the man be ill on the 3 rd stage 22 23 yield the same derivation m tm tmwi tmwwi iktmwwi 24 yields m tm tmw tmwi tmwwi iktmwwi one more than 22 23 27 yields i iktm iktmwwi disqualified by 20 28 yields m tm iktm iktmwbi the ill typed term is underlined 29 derives m tm iktm iktmwwi disqualified by 20 the winner by 20 is 24 however since nl grammar does not have to follow 20 it is unclear which if any of ill y be y be ill and y be ill the man resp 24 23 or 22 is grammatical we will return to this problem in section 8 5 generalized anaphora i propose the term generalized anaphora for analyzing pro c see tab 2 and agreement in context consider he me i they it pro that which who what when where why c where as usual the typing judgement is are of type is abbreviated in order to refer pros and cs must corefer some examples of coreference are given below we allow ad hoc abbreviations of relation symbols to fit formulas on a single line every farmer who owns a donkey beats it yp beat ity yx own a dony whop ev fap 33 every farmer beats a donkey he owns yf own hef yf beat a dony ev faf i know the man who was ill know whoa ill ya be the mana i 34 it rains yd rain itd coreference or indexing is done with small subscript letters this is an optional feature of the representation which we will occasionally suppress for simplicity however it is necessary for capturing agreement and for tracking in rules 50 52 in 34 it is a dummy pronoun required by english but not e g estonian or spanish syntax where the formula would be y rain rain in capitals because it is a zeroary relation symbol in these languages in every language a relation e g y a or own has a fixed arity number of arguments in this case one one two resp in rare cases the arity of a relation e g rain in two languages may differ cf evans and levinson 5 2009 431 in english rain is also a noun such polymorphisms are analyzed in section 11 4 in sum any relation has a fixed arity per language this is a precondition not only for formulas well formedness for 33 one might be tempted to consider the alternative formula 35 yz own yz beat a dony hez ev faz since 33 derives f ef efbod efbodho but 35 f ef efbodh efbodho the correct one by 19 is 33 the word making the third derivation stage ill typed is underlined 6 quantifiers since quantifiers are higher order relations westerstahl 2011 i e an nth order quantifier is an n 1 th order relation they are straightforwardly implemented as such in the formulas assuming their presence in the expression by quantifiers i mean those in the usual linguistic sense of the word i e expressions like one two million much many all every few no some etc so we will have considerably less quantifiers than in the theory of generalized quantifiers where even a proper name like john would be a type 1 quantifier keenan and westerstahl 2011 here are some examples involving quanfiers see also 33 a million men went to work y g to work a mil y m at least five but less than eight men left y leav but less th ei at le fi y m more complex instances of quantification will be considered in section 9 3 7 selectional restrictions the next optional step is to add selectional restrictions to our formalism cf asher 2014 luo 2010 it is reasonable to suspect that an a like red imposes the selectional restriction that its argument be of type physical entity p or that a v like read imposes a restriction that its subject be a sentient and object an informational entity i e of type s and i resp this will be expressed by redp x and readi s x y with capital subscript letters imposing type restrictions on the relation s argument s readi s x y means that x is restricted to type i and y to type s such restrictions are followed by default but not always e g one may say red ideas in a metaphorical sense of communist ideas etc for such contexts we stipulate the rule with all letters denoting constants x y t zs y type wf xt y z x z x 36 zs y xt y type where ab c is a morphosyntactic relation type with selected argument type indicated in subscript ab c the corresponding semantic interpretation wf the predicate is well formed and the relation is a subtype of for example differently from communist ideas red ideas is morphosyntactically ill typed but by virtue of 36 and the function communist red any interpretation of communist ideas is a subtype of the totality of interpretation of red ideas one 6 needs something like rule 36 to explain metaphor and metonymy without tampering with selectional restrictions below are some example formulas with selectional restrictions a animate entity note that the second argument of read is optional you are ill ya be illa youa john reads y readi s john 8 rules it is now time to formulate some rules by which morphosyntactic types compose quite inevitably all languages have morphosyntactic relations and their arguments the question is whether we can assign them universal types in any useful way we propose the following tab 1 rules john john smith ontario lake ontario pn apple mole cat tree n s he me i they

inf 1 and inf 2 resp we assume infs to be arguments of finite rs 9 2 cops we need an account of ss like j is william nice 50 behind the house her husband walking of which j is walking y wa j rs is an

least as many as 89098 less than 989890 more 62 his mother s parents son s dog s 63 more than 8374874 of his mother s father s uncle s daughter s less than 7644874 estates mansions kitchens at least

n 1 for self compositions we additionally stipulate 72 self compositions do not contain pausal cons 73 by english ortography pausal cons are signaled by the punctuation being a sufficient but not necessary condition for pausal cons by 72 73 66 68 are not self compositions most self compositions are denoted by in tab 1 e g 70 71 are nontrivial examples of adl 71 is also an adv in analyzing a

in 74 is a relation over the type to the left of the there is no circularity in 74 because the xc in xp xc is of lower order than the rightmost one for example in the s i know a man who thinks that a fish he caught was a frog the xc who is defined through the s a man thinks etc written a b a a relation over b who xc a man thinks that s a man a fish he caught a frog cap a man a frog xh xp a fish he caught xh xc he caught a fish s he a fish cap xh xp notice that the xc a fish he caught is of lower order than the xc who thinks that a fish he caught was a frog to avoid complicating 52 we assume that xcs like i know he left a fish he caught etc are elliptic abbreviations of i know that he left a fish that he caught etc 9 3 3 ps according to heine 1997 pos is universal if so the same must apply to ps suitably defined as follows 75 ps pos pro pos y x pro accounting for 62 and parts of 63 we assume that at least in some contexts the ca of is a pos 11 semantically equivalent to genitive

representing nl in l there are many more 1 it is quite clear what are xp s constituents cap q ps d adv pcv a pcj yx x pro however what modifies what is much more contentious a similar argument applies for cops 2 since as and pros are claimed to be nonuniversal dryer 2013 evans and levinson 2009 we need a cross linguistically universal characterization of a and pro like words for example should we posit a supertype for a and r to do away with r a in 43 3 evans and levinson 2009 claimed the nonuniversality of num if so how do languages without numerals account for numerosity with approximating quantifiers like few and many does this mean that the languages do not support counting and if they do how 4 there should be more examples of cross linguistic diversity to make the case about ug more credible in particular we need a comprehensive cross linguistic analysis of the underlined types in tab 1 for example some sources suggest c is missing in e g chinese see yeung 2004 ch 4 5 what are plus minus times quantifiers if so this would considerably complicate a comprehensive treatment of quantification 6 48 49 are heavily underspecified more examples of l s flexibility than useful rules and need a lot more work 7 the extent of the overlap between cap and adl adv pcv it would be useful and make the system simpler if we could identify the types for example in a s like he walks behind the house is behind the house an argument of walks or vice versa it could be either by 46 8 the treatment of is is incomplete even for english and should in all likelihood account for the possibility of forming iss with aux however our representation is not well suited for capturing word order although see section 3 so discriminating between e g he has left and has he left may be problematic 9 polymorphic exceptions e g that is both a dem and c so a possible polymorphism there is a partial overlap between aux and yr and a possibility of have being aux ir for a systematic treatment of polymorphism see section 11 4 10 specifying y s in the formulas to its subtypes wherever possible 11 are there more s schemas besides those in 51 12 11 type theory and ug 11 1 introduction obviously tab 1 can be somehow interpreted in a type theoretical context we will start by positing universes rel and arg for morphosyntactic relation and argument resp henceforth all types we consider are morphosyntactic or grammatical unless specified otherwise preliminarily since some formulas may belong to rel and others to arg only it is useful to posit the maximal ly universal universe u too in particular since 1 st order arguments are 0 th order relations all atomic formulas inhabit rel while only some inhabit arg however because all formulas signify relations by 13 we have arg rel u now write a formula a b a rel b arg do relations depend on arguments vice versa both or neither by 16 arguments depend on relations so we need dependent types i e a modern type theory in particular we will use martin l f s type theory mltt per martin l f 1984 a b gets the preliminary form a b the main dependent type constructors in mltt are and with a b would reverse the natural order by taking rel for the domain and arg for codomain so we will use the dependent pair type constructor instead thus the formula map from l to mltt is a b a b some examples 1 let a rel b arg a where arg a depends on a by 16 then rel arg is the cross linguistically and morphosyntactically universal dependent type 2 let d rel x arg then d x is likely universal by 37 38 45 because of selectional restrictions it is also a dependent type acount milk and acount stone do not have the same type since only the latter is wf without selectional restrictions d x degenerates to the non dependent pair type x d x with selectional restrictions specific formulas like redp x pro are of the type of dependent pairs x a b x since the formulas type dness will depend on x for example redp spruce is admissible i e wf by the selectional restriction p but redp noise not 11 2 axioms we have the following axioms for l 77 o a a a a 78 a a o a 1 an b 79 a 1 b an b by 78 typing is irreflexive the double line indicates a symmetric relation so the converse of the usual i e single line separated inference holds as well 11 3 context we will use the type theoretical notion of context martin l f 1984 as follows 80 for any wf ak there is a context k a sequence of judgements of the form k a 1 a 1 a 2 13 a 2 a 1 ak ak a 1 ak 1 where a 1 i k a 1 ai 1 is a type subsuming depending on a 1 ai 1 81 any proof object an of type an corresponds to an element of a context furthermore there is a context n s t an corresponds to its maximal i e final element an an a 1 an 1 a wff may be a part of several contexts if a context consists of multiple sentences they form a supersequence i 1 i m in the order we encounter them below we show how to maintain wellorder in contexts examples by 12 1 for the man man man the man the man 2 for yx smile the manx yx leave hex 1 man man the man the man the man smiled yx smile the manx 2 he hex he left yx leave hex and supersequence man man the man the man the man smiled yx smile the manx the man smiled he left yx smile the manx he hex he left yx leave hex since he left is a sentence it has a separate context 2 which must be built up before we can build this is indicated by parentheses around he hex he left yx leave hex in while 18 ensures a wellorder for sentences the notation does the same for supersequences l its interpretation and its relation to nl provide us with the following principles 82 formulae as types interpretation curry howard isomorphism by 11 or 12 83 for each wff there is a proof of its well formedness by 12 80 84 all wffs are inhabited in some nls by 83 80 85 all subformulas of a wff are wf by subformulas formulas wffs not all formulas of l are universal this is equivalent to saying that some of them will be uninhabited in some languages 11 4 polymorphism ambiguity and underspecification are pervasive features of languages in l we handle them with type polymorphism of which in nl there are 2 main kinds term underspecification data type polymorphism in computer science argument ambiguity e g subtype polymorphism in computer science we consider argument ambiguity first notice that 86 a judgement o a 1 an c is a polymorphic binary relation of type x a 1 an c martin l f 1984 handles polymorphism with universes 3 so in mltt one would fix a universe u a 1 an and the relation s type would be written x u c or u c by 79 and 86 a number of rules in tab 1 and possibly elsewhere resort to subtype polymorphism term underspecification is resolved by what we call types most types we analyze are flexemes lexeme is a lexical type flexeme or flexible luuk 2010 is a lexical type polymorphic over at least two other lexical types between which no subtyping relation holds 4 an underspecified term b 3 calculus of constructions coquand and huet 1988 offers a more explicit support for polymorphism 4 as morphemes are atomic signs form meaning correspondences we assume them to be lexemes have a lexical 14 will be typed with a separated string of symbols of all types over which b s type is polymorphic we will always write a 1 an for a type polymorphic over a 1 an and possibly some other types so a 1 an a 1 an a 1 an a 1 an by 7 and tab 2 for example the following typing judgements are correct love run x r love run x r love run r while these are incorrect love run n v love run x r a love run x x r though technically not incorrect is ambiguous between r and rs the linguistic typological importance of flexemes lies in the fact that several wakashan salishan munda and malayo polynesian languages are claimed to lack e g a adv n and or v and have lexical flexical categories x r and possibly other similar ones instead see luuk 2010 for a survey cf czaykowska higgins and kinkade 1998 36 on salishan 1 all full words including names may serve as predicates and may be inflected using person markers and 2 any lexical item can become a referring expression by positioning a determiner in front of it flexemes are more widespread than we think even in better known languages of which there are ca 200 of 7000 nordhoff 2012 for example the following especially nuts are very good nuts are especially good very nuts are especially good suggest a adv q d polymorphism for especially and particularly which unlike normal adverbs like very seem to conform with 43 as well as q d x pro we continue by giving rules for types in each rule all letters except k m denote constants introduction 1 a a 1 n a an a 1 k n a 1 m n m k n 2 a 1 an type a a 1 an a type is defined wrt at least two other types a 1 an between which no subtyping holds is not a subtype of since empty types are not allowed a single rule suffices for formation and introduction elimination wf b a 2 k n a a 1 an n 2 b b a 1 a a 1 the active or specified type of a term a of type a 1 is determined by its context i e in the context of b b a 1 a is typed a 1 under the premisses representation map to lexicon however not all atomic signs and hence lexemes are morphemes if we assume idioms to be atomic atomic signs cannot be decomposed into more elementary form meaning correspondences but atomic signs form or meaning may be complex idioms and case markers are examples resp the complexity is evident if we consider the formulas of idioms or the arguments of cases in our representation 15 12 semantics compositional semantics i e sentential phrasal and morpho semantics is built into l by virtue of 87 morphosyntactic types as categories of semantic values by 1 88 a mapping from morphemes and words 5 to morphosyntactic types 89 implementing frege s principle of compositionality 15 18 19 21 and complex types 90 selectional restrictions section 7 91 coreference section 5 as semantics is built into l we do not need a separate representation for it however if a specific e g a truth functional one were desired it could be presumably depending on the representation composed with l as said there is no need for it and thus also no need for a syntax semantics interface as far as compositional semantics is concerned more generally as witnessed by 87 91 morphosyntax and compositional semantics are two sides of the same coin so an integrated treatment should be preferred to the artificial division of linguistic labor 13 universality obviously one can model any nl grammar with such methods what about ug in l universality is accounted for by 1 the key idea the universality of nonempty subsets of certain sets supertypes of individual linguistic categories types such as n v a etc to this end universal supertypes x r etc have been employed this principle combined with polymorphism see below accounts for the universality of several atomic formulas in tab 1 2 polymorphism e g for x r and subtype definition 3 metaoperators etc e g the universality of a b entails neither the universality of a nor of b the operators are the main contributors to the universality of complex formulas in tab 1 4 a semantically integrated treatment of morphosyntax instead of morphology and syntax separately importantly ug may have substantive morphosyntactic universals without universal morphological or syntactic features cf the universality of cas adp 5 the possibility to drop outermost relation symbols without affecting the well formedness of the remaining subformula by 85 that the remaining string is a subformula is a plausible conjecture see fn 2 14 related work this work should fit into the existing tradition of applying modern type theories on nl e g asher 2014 luo 2010 ranta 1994 while being sufficiently distinct from it the main difference from luo and asher is that they analyze only semantics while major differences from ranta are the focus on ug and the representation i develop ranta 1994 is a rather direct application of mltt on nl in addition the very notion of morphosyntactic type on which l is based seems quite unique the main both philosophical and methodological difference between ranta 1994 and the present approach is that the former is more an application of mltt on nl while the latter is a description of nl in dependent and polymorphic type theory via l with mltt chosen as the well known and comprehensive theory i am most familiar with ranta 2006 is skeptical of the idea of ug that the present paper defends this work is probably unique in bridging type theory and linguistic typology 5 morpheme smallest meaningful nl unit elementary word smallest meaningful unit understood without context luuk 2010 16 15 conclusion we have described ug and more generally nl grammar with dependent and polymorphic types this is very different from the traditional chomskyan approximation of ug with rewrite rules and or syntax trees the main differences from existing type theoretical approaches to nl e g lambek 1958 montague 2002 asher 2014 luo 2010 ranta 1994 are a focus on ug an integrated treatment of morphosyntax and compositional semantics the formalism or logic l and an employment of polymorphic and dependent types beyond pure description the parsimonious specification of nl offers new perspectives for cognitively plausible i e possibly or even plausibly human nl processing and understanding algorithms
