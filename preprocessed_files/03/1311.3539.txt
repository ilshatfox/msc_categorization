sequence 1 introduction hannes leitgeb formulated in 20 the following norms for theories of truth a truth should be expressed by a predicate and a theory of syntax should be available b if a theory of truth is added to mathematical or empirical theories it should be possible to prove the latter true c the truth predicate should not be subject to any type restrictions d t biconditionals should be derivable unrestrictedly e truth should be compositional 1 http arxiv org abs 1311 3539 v 4 f the theory should allow for standard interpretations g the outer logic and the inner logic should coincide h the outer logic should be classical we present a mathematical theory of truth shortly mtt that satisfies norms a h it is formulated for suitably constructed languages which contain the first order language l of set theory they are sublanguages of l t where t is a monadic predicate while not entailing all formalities of first order languages they are closed under logical connectives and quantifiers of first order predicate logic zermelo fraenkel zf set theory sets of its minimal model m concepts definable in l and classical two valued logic are main tools mtt proves zf set theory modelled by m true as stated in 15 first order zermelo fraenkel set theory is widely regarded as the standard of mathematical correctness in the sense that a proof is correct if and only if it can be formalised as a formal proof in set theory as shown in 1 with some elementary assumptions about truth and logic a logical disaster ensues it is caused by liar paradox paradoxes led zermelo to axiomatize set theory by 20 tarski excluded all liar like sentences from being well formed from his theory of truth cf 23 construction of sublanguages enables mtt to satisfy also the following norms i the mathematical theory of truth should be free from paradoxes j truth should be defined for languages within the very languages themselves mtt is immune to tarski s commandment cf 21 to tarski s undefinability theorem cf 23 to tarskian hierarchies cf 9 and to revenge of the liar cf 6 model m can be replaced by any countable model of zf or other set theory examples of such theories are presented e g in 19 the language l can be replaced by the language of arithmetic and m by a standard model of arithmetic in 14 mtt is extended to a more general class of languages pkf theory cf 10 11 axiomatizes kripke s theory of truth cf 18 both inner and outer logic of pkf are partial whence norms h and j are not valid kripke s theory don t satisfy norms d and g because of partially interpreted truth predicate and three valued inner logic theory kf which axiomatizes kripke s closed off models cf 5 6 18 don t satisfy norms d g and i norm g is rejected in 6 preferring norm g over any mixture of two different logics and h over partial logic we use classical logic and construct sublanguages modifying wittgenstein whereof one must not speak thereof one can be silent 2 2 preliminaries as for the used terminology cf e g 13 19 denote bym the minimal countable transitive and well founded model of zf set theory constructed in 4 it follows from 19 lemma ii 8 22 that for each sentence a of the language l either a or its negation a is true in m in the sense defined in 19 cf 19 ii 7 and p 237 m contains by 4 17 natural numbers assume that their names called numerals are defined in l e g as in 8 first we shall construct a family of sublanguages for the language l t where t is a monadic predicate denote by d the set of go del numbers of sentences of l in its fixed go del numbering let a denote the go del number of a sentence a of l and a the numeral of a given a subset u of d define subsets g u and f u of d by following rules iff abbreviates if and only if r 1 if a is in l then a is in g u iff a is true in m and in f u iff a is true in m r 2 if a is in l then t a is in g u iff a is in u and in f u iff a is in u sentences determined by rules r 1 and r 2 i e all sentences a of l and those sentences t a of l for which a or a is in u are called basic sentences next five rules deal with logical connectives let a and b be sentences of l r 3 negation rule a is in g u iff a is in f u and in f u iff a is in g u r 4 disjunction rule a b is in g u iff a or b is in g u and in f u iff a and b are in f u r 5 conjunction rule a b is in g u iff a b is in f u iff by r 3 and r 4 both a and b are in g u similarly a b is in f u iff a b is in g u iff a or b is in f u r 6 implication rule a b is in g u iff a b is in g u iff by r 3 and r 4 a is in f u or b is in g u a b is in f u iff a b is in f u iff a is in g u and b is in f u r 7 biconditionality rule a b is in g u iff a and b are both in g u or both in f u and in f u iff a is in g u and b is in f u or a is in f u and b is in g u when a x is a formula in l then quantifications xa x and xa x are sentences of l hence rule r 1 is applicable for them so it suffices to set rules for xt x and xt x assume that the set x of numerals of go del numbers of sentences of l is the intended domain of discourse for t we set the following rules 3 r 8 xt x is in g u iff t n is in g u for some n x and xt x is in f u iff t n is in f u for every n x r 9 xt x is in g u iff t n is in g u for every n x and xt x is in f u iff t n is in f u at least for one n x rules r 1 r 9 and induction on the complexity of formulas determine uniquely subsets g u and f u of d whenever u is a subset of d sublanguages lu of l formed by those sentences a of l for which a is in g u or in f u contain all sentences of l and are closed under logical connectives and quantifiers we say that a subset u of d is consistent iff both a and a are not in u for any sentence a of l for instance the empty set is consistent the following two lemmas have counterparts in 12 lemma 2 1 let u be a consistent subset of d then g u f u i e every sentence of lu belongs either to g u or to f u proof if a is in l then by rule r 1 and 19 lemma ii 8 22 a is not in g u f u by rule r 2 t a is in g u iff a is in u and in f u iff a is in u thus t a cannot be both in g u and in f u because u is consistent make an induction hypothesis h 0 a and b are such sentences of l that neither a nor b is in g u f u as shown above h 0 holds if a and b are basic sentences if a is in g u f u then a is in f u g u hence if h 0 holds then a is not in g u f u if a b is in g u f u then a or b is in g u and both a and b are in f u by r 4 so that a or b is in g u f u hence if h 0 holds then a b is not in g u f u a b cannot be in g u f u for otherwise both a and b are in g u and at least one of a and b is in f u contradicting with h 0 if a is in g u f u then a is in f u g u and h 0 is not valid thus under the hypothesis h 0 neither a nor b is in g u f u this result and the above result for disjunction imply that a b or equivalently a b is not in g u f u similarly a b is not in g u f u for otherwise a or b would be in g u f u by rule r 7 contradicting with h 0 it remains to show that xt x and xt x are not in g u f u if u is empty then t n is by rule r 2 neither in g u nor in f u for any n x thus xt x is by rule r 8 neither in g u nor in f u and hence not in g u f u 4 if u is not empty then a is in u for some a in l since u is consistent then a is not in u by rule r 2 t a is not in f u thus xt x is by rule r 8 not in f u and hence not in g u f u because u is consistent it is a proper subset of d thus there is n d such that n 6 u but n a for some sentence a of l whence t n t a is not in g u by rule r 2 consequently xt x is by rule r 9 not in g u and hence not in g u f u the above results and induction on the complexity of formulas imply that a is not in g u f u for any sentence a of l lemma 2 2 if u is a consistent subset of d then both g u and f u are consistent proof if g u is not consistent then there is such a sentence a of l that a and a are in g u because a is in g u then a is also in f u by rule r 3 and hence in g u f u but then by lemma 2 1 u is not consistent consequently if u is consistent then g u is consistent the proof that f u is consistent if u is is similar 3 a mathematical theory of truth and its properties recall that d denotes the set of go del numbers of sentences of the language l t given a subset u of d let g u and f u be the subsets of d constructed in section 2 definition 3 1 assume that u is a consistent subset of d and that u g u denote by lu the language containing those sentences a of l t for which a is in g u or in f u a sentence a of lu is interpreted as true iff a is in g u and as false iff a is in f u t is called a truth predicate for lu the existence of consistent subsets u of d satisfying u g u including the smallest one is proved in section 4 the main goal of this paper is to prove the following theorem for the above defined mathe matical theory of truth shortly mtt theorem 3 1 assume that u is a consistent subset of d and that u g u then mtt satisfies all the norms a j presented in the introduction proof a the syntax of mtt is comprised by logical symbols of first order predicate logic nonlogical symbols and t natural numbers as constants numerals as terms and variables ranging in m t is the truth predicate for lu by definition 3 1 b assume that a is a sentence of l by 19 lemma ii 8 22 either a is true in m or a is true in m a is false in m 5 a is true in m iff a is in g u by rule r 1 iff a is in u because u g u iff t a is in g u by rule r 2 iff t a is true by definition 3 1 a is true in m iff a is in g u by rule r 1 iff a is in u because u g u iff t a is in f u by rule r 2 iff t a is false by definition 3 1 consequently a sentence a of l is true in m iff t a is true and false in m iff t a is false thus mtt proves the zf set theory modelled by m true c t is by definition 3 1 a truth predicate for lu and is not subject to any restrictions within lu d let a be a sentence of lu since u is consistent then a is by lemma 2 1 either in g u or in f u applying rules r 2 and r 3 and the assumption u g u we obtain a is in g u iff a is in u iff t a is in g u a is in f u iff a is in g u iff a is in u iff t a is in f u consequently a and t a are both either in g u or in f u thus a t a is by rule r 7 in g u so that a t a is true by definition 3 1 this holds for every sentence a of lu whence t biconditionals a t a are derivable unrestrictedly in lu e it follows from definition 3 1 that a is in g u can be replaced by a is true and a is in f u by a is false thus rules r 3 r 9 imply that the truth in mtt is compositional f mtt allows for standard interpretations m is by 17 a standard model of set theory g the outer logic and the inner logic coincide in mtt because of d as stated 20 h by the proof of e the logic of lu i e the inner logic of mtt is classical this and g imply that also the outer logic of mtt is classical i since u is consistent it follows from lemmas 2 1 and 2 2 that every sentence of lu is either true or false in the sense of definition 3 1 thus mtt is free from paradoxes only mathematical methods are used in it s formulation whence it is a mathematical theory j by definition 3 1 truth for the language is defined within the language lu itself remarks 3 1 if is a monadic predicate of l there is such a sentence a in l that bicon ditionality a a is provable from axioms of zf set theory cf e g 19 lemma iv 5 31 thus t biconditionality rule d does not hold in l when t in particular l does not contain its truth predicate this holds also for the language l to satisfy all norms a j it is then essential that those languages lu for which mtt is formulated differ both from l and from l this holds in our approach since g u f u is a proper and nonempty subset of d when u is a consistent fixed point of g the language lu corresponding to the smallest consistent fixed point u of g relates to the language of grounded sentences defined in 12 18 see also 7 where considerations are restricted to signed statements of l mtt is only a theory of truth depending e g on the semantic notion true in m moreover the construction of m starts from the set the existence of which is a matter of faith 6 4 appendix let p denote the family of all consistent subsets of the set d of go del numbers of sentences of l fixed points of the set mapping g u 7 g u from p to p i e those u p for which u g u have a central role in the formulation of mtt before the proof of our main fixed point theorem we prove some auxiliary results lemma 4 1 let u and v be sets of p and assume that u v if a is a sentence of l then a is in g v whenever it is in g u and a is in f v whenever it is in f u proof assume that u v consider first basic sentences let a be a sentence of l by rule r 1 a is in g u and also in g v iff a is true in m and both in f u and in f v iff a is true in m let a be a sentence of l if t a is in g u then a is in u by rule r 2 because u v then a belongs to v whence t a is in g v by rule r 2 if t a is in f u then a is in u by rule r 2 since u v then a belongs to v so that t a is in f v by rule r 2 thus all basic sentences satisfy the lemma assume that a is a sentence of l if a is in g u but not in g v then a is in f u but not in f v by rule r 3 if a is in f u but not in f v then a is in g u but not in g v by rule r 3 hence if a satisfies the lemma then also a satisfies it make an induction hypothesis h 1 a and b are such sentences of l that a is in g v if it is in g u a is in f v if it is in f u b is in g v if it is in g u and b is in f v if it is in f u if a b is in g u then a or b is in g u by rule r 4 by h 1 a or b is in g v so that a b is in g v if a b is in f u then a and b are in f u by rule r 4 and hence also in f v by h 1 so that a b is in f v thus a b satisfies the lemma if h 1 holds if a b is in g u then both a and b are in g u by rule r 5 and hence also in g v by h 1 thus a b is in g v if a b is in f u then a or b is in f u by rule r 5 and hence also in f v by h 1 whence a b is in f v thus a b satisfies the lemma if h 1 holds if a b is in g u then a or b is in g u i e a is in f u or b is in g u then by h 1 a is in f v or b is in g v i e a or b is in g v thus a b is in g v if a b is in f u then a is in g u and b is in f u this implies by h 1 that a is in g v and b is in f v so that a b is in f v thus a b satisfies the lemma if h 1 holds 7 if a b is in g u then a and b are both in g u or both in f u and hence both in g v or both in f v if h 1 holds so that a b is in g v if a b is in f u then a is in g u and b is in f u or vice versa thus a is in g v and b is in f v or vice versa if h 1 holds so that a b is in f v thus a b satisfies the lemma if h 1 holds because h 1 holds for basic sentences the above results and induction on the complexity of expressions imply that logical connectives of sentences of l satisfy the lemma it follows from the proof of lemma 2 1 that xt x is neither in f u nor in f v if xt x is in g u then t n is in g u for some n x since n a for some sentence a of l then t a is in g u thus a is by rule r 2 in u and hence also in v then by rule r 2 t a t n is in g v so that xt x is in g v by rule r 8 consequently xt x is in g v whenever it is in g u the proof of lemma 2 1 implies that xt x is neither ing u nor in g v if xt x is in f u then t n is in f u for some n x but n a for some sentence a of l so that t a is in f u so a is by rule r 2 in u and hence also in v thus by rule r 2 t a t n is in f v so that xt x is in f v by rule r 8 consequently xt x is in f v whenever it is in f u the above results imply the conclusion of the lemma according to lemma 2 2 the mapping g u 7 g u maps p into p assuming that p is ordered by inclusion the above lemma implies the following result lemma 4 2 g is order preserving in p i e g u g v whenever u and v are sets of p and u v as above lemmas also the next lemma has a counterpart in 12 lemma 4 3 a if w is a chain in p then the union w u u w is consistent b the intersection w u u w of every nonempty subfamily w of p is a consistent subset of d proof a assume on the contrary that w is not consistent then there is a such a sentence a of l that both a and a are in w thus w has a member say u which contains a and a member say v which contains a if w is a chain then u v or v u in former case v and in latter case u contains both a and a but this is impossible because w is a subfamily of p this proves a b the intersection w is a subset of d and is contained in every member of w hence w is consistent for otherwise there is such a sentence a in l that both a and a are in w then every member of w would also contain both a and a but this is impossible because every member of w is consistent this proves b 8 in the formulation and the proof of our main fixed point theorem we use transfinite sequences of p indexed by von neumann ordinals such a sequence u of p is said to be strictly increasing if u u whenever and strictly decreasing if u u whenever a set v of p is called sound iff v g v the following fixed point theorem is an application of lemmas 2 2 4 2 and 4 3 theorem 4 1 if v p is sound then there exists the smallest of those fixed points of g which contain v this fixed point is the last member of the union of those transfinite sequences u of p which satisfy c u is strictly increasing u 0 v and if 0 then u g u proof let v p be sound transfinite sequences of p satisfying c are called g sequences we shall first show that g sequences are nested 1 assume that u and v are g sequences and that u 6 v then v u by the assumption of 1 min u 6 v exists and u v properties c imply by transfinite induction that u v for each to prove that make a counter hypothesis since and u v for each it follows from properties c that u g u g v v which is impossible since v v but u 6 v consequently and u v for each whence v u by definition every g sequence u is a function 7 u from into p property 1 implies that these functions are compatible thus their union is by 16 theorem 2 3 12 a function with values in p the domain being the union of all index sets of g sequences because these index sets are ordinals then their union is also an ordinal by 19 i 8 10 denote it by the union function can be represented as a sequence u of p it is strictly increasing as a union of strictly increasing nested sequences to show that is a successor assume on the contrary that is a limit ordinal given then and are in and u is a g sequence denote u g u g is order preserving by lemma 4 2 and u is a strictly increasing sequence of p thus g u is a chain in p whence u is consistent by lemma 4 3 a moreover u u g u u this holds for each whence u is a g sequence this is impossible since u is the union of all g sequences consequently is a successor say thus u is the last member of u u max u and g u max g u moreover u is a g sequence for otherwise u 9 would be the union of all g sequences in particular u g u g u g u so that u g u equality holds since otherwise the longest g sequence u could be extended by u g u thus u is a fixed point of g in p assume that w p is a fixed point of g and that v w then u 0 v w if 0 and u w for each then g u g w for each whence u g u g w w thus by transfinite induction u w for each thus u w so that u is the smallest fixed point of g that contains v as a consequence of theorem 4 1 we obtain corollary 4 1 g has the smallest fixed point proof the empty set is both sound and consistent thus the smallest fixed point of g that contains exists by theorem 4 1 it is the smallest fixed point of g since every fixed point of g contains next we prove that every consistent subset ofd has the greatest sound and consistent subset theorem 4 2 the equation v w g v has for each consistent subset w of d the greatest solution v in p it is the greatest sound set of p that is contained in w v is the last member of the union of those transfinite sequences v of p which satisfy d v is strictly decreasing v 0 w and if 0 then v w g v proof assume that w is a consistent subset of d like the proof that the union of all g sequences is a g sequence one can prove that the union of all transfinite sequences which have properties d given in theorem 4 2 has property d let v be that sequence denote v w g v because w and the sets v are consistent it follows from lemma 2 2 and lemma 4 3 b that v is consistent moreover v v for each if v v for each then the choice v v implies that v satisfies d when but this is impossible because of the choice of v thus v min v and v is the last member of v because this sequence is strictly decreasing since g is order preserving then g v min g v g v thus v w g v so that v g v i e v is sound and is contained in w assume that u is consistent that u g u and that u w since v 0 w by d then u v 0 if 0 and u v for each then g u g v for each whence u w g u w g v v thus by transfinite induction u v 10 for each so that u min v v consequently v is the greatest sound and consistent subset of d that is contained in w the following results shows that if w is any consistent set of go del numbers of sentences of l and v is determined by theorem 4 2 then the union of the g sequences c of theorem 4 1 is the smallest fixed point of g corollary 4 2 let w be a consistent subset of d containing only go del numbers of sen tences of l then a v w g w is the greatest consistent solution of v v g v contained in w b the union of the g sequences c of v w g w is the smallest fixed point of g proof a let w be a consistent set of go del numbers of sentences of l g w contains by rule r 1 go del numbers of those sentences of l which are true in m and only those thus v w g w is the set of go del numbers of those sentences of w which are true in m hence v g g v so that v is sound it is also consistent as an intersection of two consistent sets consequently v w g w is a solution of v v g v and by theorem 4 2 the greatest solution contained in w b v w g w is by a sound and consistent and v g if u is a fixed point of g then v g g u u thus v is contained in the smallest fixed point of g by theorem 4 1 the union of the g sequences c is the smallest fixed point of g that contains v this proves b remarks 4 1 the smallest members of u satisfying c are n fold iterations un gn v n n 0 1 if they form a strictly increasing sequence the next member u is their union u n g n u n n and so on if the set w is finite then the longest sequence v satisfying d is obtained by the finite algorithm v 0 w for n from 0 while vn 6 w g vn do vn 1 w g vn zorn s lemma together with lemmas 4 2 and 4 3 can be applied e g as in 7 12 to prove results of theorem 4 1 and corollary 4 1 and also the existence of maximal fixed points of g zf set theory is no more sufficient framework for such proofs since zorn s lemma is equivalent to the axiom of choice the result of theorem 4 2 that gives a method to determine sound subsets of d seems to be new as for generalizations of theorems 4 1 and 4 2 see e g 2 14
