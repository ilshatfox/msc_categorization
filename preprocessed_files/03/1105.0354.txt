we briefly examine the modal formulae that can be derived in multiplicative additive linear logic mall and some extensions by using tarksi s extensional modal operators we also breifly compare this with a substructural form of the modal logic k 1 introduction the tarskian mo glichkeit literally possibility in german is a modal operator that was introduced by ukasiewicz and attributed to tarski in 13 7 this modal oper ator is unusual in that it is an extensional one defined in terms of other connectives in ukasiewicz s many valued logics a de f a a 1 the modal logic that results from this definition is unusual in part because of the theorems such as a b a b 2 in the case where b a theorem 2 appears to be paradoxical if not absurd and largely because of this the tarskian mo glichkeit has been a footnote in the history of modal logic most of the analyses that we are aware of has been for the 3 valued logic in 12 8 but omitted from 9 5 and 3 and it is generally critical an application of the m 3 valued logics to describing m state systems was suggested in 20 and an application of the infinite valued logic applied to modelling degrees of believability was suggested by the current author in 17 however the infinite valued logic can be seen as an extension of affine logic 4 and many of the modal formulae derivable in the infinite valued logic are derivable in weaker substructural logics we give an overview of some of the formal properties below by noting modal rules and formulae in the corresponding logics we make no claims about the applications of the tarskian mo glichkeit 2 multiplicative additive linear logic the sequent rules for gmall a calculus for multiplicative additive linear logic mall 6 are given in figure 1 using notation similar to 19 in particular we use for par multiplicative disjunction and for plus additive disjunction the modal rules figure 2 are derived in a straightforward manner the corresponding box operator is defined as the dual of diamond operator a de f a date november 15 2018 1 http arxiv org abs 1105 0354 v 2 2 robert rothenberg 0 l 0 0 r 0 1 l 1 1 r 1 l r a b a b l a b a b r a b a b l a b a b r a a b l 1 b a b l 2 a

with a we obtain a calculus gkmall for kmall by adding the following rule to gmall a a k which corresponds to adding to mall the necessity rule a a n and the k axiom a b a b remark 3 cut elimination for gkmall is shown in appendix a theorem 5 if gkmall then gmall proof by induction on the derivation height note that formulae are be introduced into a kmall derivation either by axioms l and r or by the k rule instances of k are replaced by instances of k 4 robert rothenberg remark 4 gkmall 0 a a and a a a form of the k rule that allows for empty succedents e g k where 1 would allow for the derivation of 5 and 6 but not a a 7 and a a 8 remark 5 the converse of 10 a b a b is not derivable in either gmall or gkmall 4 multiplicative additive linear logic withmingle linear logics with mingle

note that the formulae 14 and 15 can be derived using anti contraction duplication rules as well a a a lc 1 a a a rc 1 5 affine logic affine logic 7 also called affine multiplicative additive linear logic amall is mall augmented with the weakening axiom a 1 0 a the corresponding calculus gamall is obtained by adding weakening rules to gmall a lw a rw remark 7 in affine logic 0 and 1 proposition 7 if gmall m a then gamall a proof m is admissible in gamall remark 8 hence the formulae in proposition 6 are derivable in gamall proposition 8 additive modal rules the following rules can be derived in

these are the converse of formulae 30 through 33 note that 31 is the same formulae as 2 mentioned in the introduction indeed 30 may also be considered paradoxical 6 robert rothenberg 7 involutive

5 is noteworthy in that all of the derivable modal sequents derivable in gkmall correspond to derivable modal sequents in gmall using the tarskian mo glichkeit a semantic characterisation of the tarskian modalities with respect to various logics is in process a deeper comparison of substructural logics with tarskian modalities and their coun terpart extensions to kmall is an area of future investigation acknowledgements we d like to thank those attending a talk at an lfcs lab lunch about this topic for their comments and suggestions appendix a substructural k kmall lemma 16 cut admissibility gkmall admits cut a a cut proof note that gmall admits cut 19 adding k to gkmall also admits cut by induction on the derivation height with the following cases 1 if the cut formula is not of the form a then permute cut upwards 2 if the cut formula is not the principal formula on either premiss permute the cut upward on that premiss 3 if the cut formula is the principal formula of either an instance of l or r then so is the conclusion of the cut 4 the remaining case is that both premisses of the cut are the conclusions of in stances of k the cut is then permuted to the premisses of both k instances and k is applied to the conclusion of the cut 8 robert rothenberg references 1 a avron hypersequents logical consequence and intermediate logics for concurrency ann math
