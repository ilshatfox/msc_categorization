monthly 105 1998 41 51 arxived with permission many mathematicians have a dismissive attitude towards paradoxes this is un fortunate because many paradoxes are rich in content having connections with serious mathematical ideas as well as having pedagogical value in teaching elementary logical reasoning an excellent example is the so called surprise examination paradox de scribed below which is an argument that seems at first to be too silly to deserve much attention however it has inspired an amazing variety of philosophical and mathemati cal investigations that have in turn uncovered links to go del s incompleteness theorems game theory and several other logical paradoxes e g the liar paradox and the sorites paradox unfortunately most mathematicians are unaware of this because most of the literature has been published in philosophy journals in this article i describe some of this work emphasizing the ideas that are particularly interesting mathematically i also try to dispel some of the confusion that surrounds the paradox and plagues even the published literature however i do not try to correct every error or explain every idea that has ever appeared in print readers who want more comprehensive surveys should see 30 chapters 7 and 8 20 and 16 at times i assume some knowledge of mathematical logic such as may be found in enderton 10 but the reader who lacks this background may safely skim these sections 1 the paradox and the meta paradox let us begin by recalling the paradox it has many variants the earliest probably being lennart ekbom s surprise drill and the best known to mathematicians thanks to quine and gardner being an unexpected hanging we shall give the surprise examination version a teacher announces in class that an examination will be held on some day during the following week and moreover that the examination will be a surprise the students argue that a surprise exam cannot occur for suppose the exam were on the last day of the week then on the previous night the students would be able to predict that the exam would occur on the following day and the exam would not be a surprise so it is impossible for a surprise exam to occur on the last day but then a surprise exam cannot occur on the penultimate day either for in that case the students knowing that the last day is an impossible day for a surprise exam would be able to predict on the night before the exam that the exam would occur on the following day similarly the students argue that a surprise exam cannot occur on any other day of the week either confident in this conclusion they are of course totally surprised when the exam occurs 1 http arxiv org abs math 9903160 v 4 on wednesday say the announcement is vindicated after all where did the students reasoning go wrong the natural reaction to a paradox like this is to try to resolve it indeed if you have not seen this paradox before i encourage you to try to resolve it now before reading on however i do not want to discuss the resolution of the paradox right away instead for reasons that should become apparent i discuss what i call the meta paradox first the meta paradox consists of two seemingly incompatible facts the first is that the surprise exam paradox seems easy to resolve those seeing it for the first time typically have the instinctive reaction that the flaw in the students reasoning is obvious furthermore most readers who have tried to think it through have had little difficulty resolving it to their own satisfaction the second astonishing fact is that to date nearly a hundred papers on the paradox have been published and still no consensus on its correct resolution has been reached the paradox has even been called a significant problem for philosophy 30 chapter 7 section vii how can this be can such a ridiculous argument really be a major unsolved mystery if not why does paper after paper begin by brusquely dismissing all previous work and claiming that it alone presents the long awaited simple solution that lays the paradox to rest once and for all some other paradoxes suffer from a similar meta paradox but the problem is es pecially acute in the case of the surprise examination paradox for most other trivial sounding paradoxes there is broad consensus on the proper resolution whereas for the surprise exam paradox there is not even agreement on its proper formulation since one s view of the meta paradox influences the way one views the paradox itself i must try to clear up the former before discussing the latter in my view most of the confusion has been caused by authors who have plunged into the process of resolving the paradox without first having a clear idea of what it means to resolve a paradox the goal is poorly understood so controversy over whether the goal has been attained is inevitable let me now suggest a way of thinking about the process of resolving a paradox that i believe dispels the meta paradox in general there are two steps involved in resolving a paradox first one establishes precisely what the paradoxical argument is any unclear terms are defined carefully and all assumptions and logical steps are stated clearly and explicitly possibly in a formal language of some kind second one finds the fault in the argument sometimes simply performing step one reveals the flaw e g when the paradox hinges on confusing two different meanings of the same word so that pointing out the ambiguity suffices to dispel the confusion in other cases however something more needs to be done one must locate the bad assumptions the bad reasoning or in desperate circumstances the flaw in the structure of logic itself 2 these two steps seem straightforward but there are a few subtleties for example if in the second step the flaw is caused by bad assumptions it may be hard to isolate a unique culprit sometimes what we discover is a set of mutually incompatible assumptions such that rejecting any one of them suffices to eliminate the contradiction when this occurs however notice that while it may be an interesting question to decide which assumption to reject such a decision is not usually needed to resolve the paradox it is usually enough to exhibit the incompatible assumptions and state that their joint inconsistency is the source of the paradox the first step of resolving a paradox can also be subtle as many investigators of the surprise exam paradox have noted formal versions of a paradox sometimes miss the essence of the original informal version such a mistranslation evades the paradox instead of resolving it certainly this is a real danger and numerous authors have fallen into this trap however there is a simple but important point here that is often overlooked the question of whether or not a particular formalization of a paradox captures its essence is to some extent a matter of opinion given two formalizations of the paradox one person may think that the first captures the essence better but another may prefer the second one cannot say who is objectively right since there is always some vagueness in the original informal account to be sure one can sometimes argue that a particular formalization is inadequate by proposing a variation of the paradox that seems to retain its essence but for which the particular formalization fails even here though there is some room for differences of opinion because one can sometimes argue that the variant paradox does not in fact retain the essence but is actually a different paradox that requires a different solution thus sometimes there exist multiple formalizations of a paradox that all capture its essence reasonably well in such cases i believe it is misguided to speak of the resolution of the paradox this point has also been made by kirkham 16 with these ideas in mind we can easily explain the meta paradox a careful look at the literature confirms our suspicion that the paradox is not hard to resolve because most authors have succeeded in finding resolutions most of the controversies have been false controversies for example there has been much debate between what i call the epistemological school which formalizes the paradox using concepts such as knowledge belief and memory and the logical school which avoids such concepts over who has the right formalization but both approaches are reasonable and neither is guilty of evasion also within the epistemological school there has been much debate over which axiom of a certain set of mutually inconsistent axioms about knowledge should be rejected the question is an interesting one from the point of view of philosophically analyzing the concept of knowledge but if we agree that identifying the right axiom to reject is not essential to resolving the paradox then this debate need not trouble us 3 having dealt with the meta paradox we now turn to the paradox itself and explore several different approaches 2 the logical school we mathematicians have a firm belief that logic and mathematics are consistent when we are confronted with a paradox therefore our tendency is to assume even before analyzing the paradox that either the paradox cannot be translated into a purely logical or mathematical argument or that if it can be so translated the faulty step or assumption will become immediately apparent so a natural reaction to the surprise examination paradox at least for a mathematician is to take the students argument and try to convert it into a rigorous proof in order to find the flaw let us now do this and see what happens every proof begins with axioms the students argument seems to deduce a contra diction from the teacher s announcement so it seems that the axioms in this case ought to be some formalization of the announcement now part of the announcement the claim that an examination will take place some time during the following week is not difficult to formalize but the part that says that the examination will be a surprise is not as clear what is meant by surprise whatever surprise means it must at least mean that the students will not be able to deduce logically the date of the examination ahead of time for if the students could prove that the date of the examination were such and such before the date arrived they would surely not be at all surprised by the exam so a first step towards formalizing the teacher s announcement might be there will be an examination next week and its date will not be deducible in advance this is not sufficient however because every proof begins with axioms to say that the date of the examination will not be deducible in advance is a vague statement until the axioms from which the date cannot be deduced are specified precisely now it is not completely clear which axioms are in question here the informal word surprise is too vague to give us many clues however if our formalization is to be at all true to the original paradox it should at least allow us to formalize the students argument to some degree formalizing the teacher s announcement as a there will be an examination next week and its date will not be deducible in advance from an empty set of assumptions is certainly not satisfactory because it does not allow the students argument even to begin this would evade the paradox and not resolve it a better attempt at formalization might be something like b there will be an examination next week and its date will not be deducible in advance from the assumption that the examination will occur some time during the week 4 this formalization allows at least the first step of the students argument to be carried out given this announcement the students can deduce that the examination will not occur on the last day of the week however if we try to reproduce the next step of the students argument the step that eliminates the penultimate day of the week we find ourselves stuck in order to eliminate the penultimate day the students need to argue that their ability to deduce from statement b that the examination will not occur on the last day implies that a last day examination will not be surprising but since we have restricted surprising to mean not deducible from the assumption that the examination will occur sometime during the week instead of not deducible from statement b the students argument is blocked to continue the argument we need to be able to use the nondeducibility from the announcement as an assumption i e we must embed the nondeducibility from the announcement into the announcement itself it now becomes clear that to carry out the students argument one needs a formal ization that is something like c there will be an examination next week and its date will not be deducible in advance using this announcement as an axiom in other words the announcement must be formulated as a self referential statement there is a temptation to end the analysis here with a comment that the self referential nature of statement c is the source of the paradox after all if a self referential definition like this were to be presented in a mathematical paper we would surely reject it instantly as illegal indeed shaw concludes his paper 25 with just such a comment however we need to be careful for it is possible in mathematics to formalize certain kinds of self referential statements indeed this was one of the crucial ideas in go del s proof of his incompleteness theorems and it is now a standard technique in mathematical logic it is natural to ask if this technique can be used to obtain a completely formal version of statement c the answer is yes we give the construction due to fitch 11 4 and 32 have similar constructions in some detail since it is rather interesting let us reduce the number of days to two for simplicity we consider one day weeks shortly and let q 1 and q 2 be statements representing the occurrence of the exam on days one and two respectively then what we are seeking is a statement s such that s q 1 s q 1 is unprovable or else q 2 s q 1 q 2 is unprovable given a first order language that contains enough elementary arithmetic to handle prim itive recursive functions together with some go del numbering of the formulas it is straightforward to formalize most aspects of this statement there are primitive recursive functions neg conj and imp encoding negation conjunction and implication i e if q is the go del number of q then neg q is the go del number of the negation of q and so on and a primitive recursive relation r that relates i to j if and only if i is the go del 5 number of a proof of the sentence whose go del number is j the only tricky part is the self reference and this is achieved using the usual primitive recursive diagonalization operator d d m n is the go del number of the sentence obtained by replacing the free variable in the formula having go del number m by the name of the number n now let q 1 and q 2 be the go del numbers of q 1 and q 2 respectively let 6 denote exclusive or and let p x abbreviate y yrx p stands for provable then we can formulate the following formula with the free variable x q 1 p d x x imp q 1 6 q 2 p d x x conj neg q 1 imp q 2 let h be the go del number of this formula and let s be the sentence obtained by substituting h for x i e q 1 p d h h imp q 1 6 q 2 p d h h conj neg q 1 imp q 2 then by definition of d d h h is the go del number of s the clincher is that d h h also appears on the right hand side of exactly where we want it to appear using to denote the name of the go del number of we can rewrite s as q 1 p s q 1 6 q 2 p s q 1 q 2 this completes the formalization of statement c we can now imitate the students argument to show that s is logically false i e that s is a tautology using the definition of s we can prove s q 1 q 2 1 let a be the go del number of 1 by the nature of the relation r the provability of 1 implies p a but observe that p a appears in the second disjunct in the definition of s it follows that s q 1 2 the rest of the argument is now clear if b is the go del number of 2 then the provability of 2 implies p b but p b appears in the first disjunct of s therefore s thus although self reference is not illegitimate in all circumstances it is illegitimate here because this particular self referential statement is self contradictory fitch s proof has a satisfying air of definitiveness and seems to vindicate shaw however various authors have raised objections to this analysis the most important is that the proof does not give any explanation for why the teacher s announcement appears to be vindicated after the fact it appears to pin the blame on the teacher s announcement instead of on the students and surely this cannot be correct 6 a related objection rests on the observation that if the teacher had not announced the exam to the class but had simply decided in secret to give a surprise exam then no paradox would have occurred therefore the trouble cannot be attributed solely to the propositional content of the teacher s announcement the act of announcing it to the students must play a crucial role the purely logical analysis seems to ignore this these objections have convinced many to reject entirely the purely logical approach and to propose a different epistemological approach before moving on to a discussion of the epistemological school however i want to point out that the objections can be met for example the first objection indicates a misun derstanding of the purely logical approach the conclusion of the logical analysis is not that the teacher s announcement is self contradictory and is the source of the paradox rather the conclusion is that in order for the students to carry out their argument that the teacher s announcement cannot be fulfilled they must interpret the teacher s announcement as saying something like c if the teacher intended c when making the announcement then it would be contradictory and would remain so after the examination however a more reasonable assumption is that the teacher s announcement whatever it means does not mean c and that therefore the students misinterpret the announcement when they make their argument the announcement appears to be vindicated afterwards but the statement that is actually vindicated is something like the students will be psychologically surprised by the exam and such a statement does not permit the students argument to be carried out similar observations are made in 4 and 9 as for the objection about the role of the act of making the announcement observe that the same sequence of words can have different meanings depending on context and that in the case of the teacher s announcement the public utterance of the sentence changes its propositional content from there will be a surprise exam to something like there will be a surprise exam in spite of the fact that i am now telling you that there will be a surprise exam the logical analysis therefore does take into account the act of making the announcement albeit implicitly in its definition of the word surprise ignoring the act of making the announcement would leave us stuck at a 3 the epistemological school the purely logical approach is attractive to a mathematician both because it shows exactly what problems arise from trying to convert the paradoxical argument into a mathematical proof and because it has connections to nontrivial theorems of logic however it has one serious disadvantage certain aspects of the paradox the act of announcing the exam the belief or disbelief that the students have in the announcement their assumption that they will remember the announcement during the course of the week and so on are taken into account only implicitly and not explicitly it is therefore natural to ask if we can formalize the paradox in a way that lays bare these epistemic aspects 7 various epistemological formalizations have been proposed in the literature we give just one here taken from 29 to illustrate the idea as before reduce the number of days to two for simplicity let 1 denote the exam occurs on the first day and let 2 denote the exam occurs on the second day let ka denote on the eve of the first day the students will know and let kb denote on the eve of the second day the students will know the announcement can then be written 1 ka 1 2 kb 2 kb 1 1 2 we now introduce certain assumptions about knowledge and add them to our list of rules of inference in our logic kd if one knows a b then one knows a and one knows b similarly if one knows that a implies b and one knows a then one knows b ki all logical truths are known ke it is not possible to know something that is false we begin the argument with a lemma kb 2 remember that here encom passes our new rules of logic kd ki and ke assume that kb is true by kd it follows that kb 1 2 now assume towards a contradiction that 2 is true i e the exam is held on the last day from kb and ke follows and 2 together with second conjunct of implies kb 2 kb 1 in particular kb 2 on the other hand using kd we deduce from kb 1 2 and kb 1 that kb 2 a contradiction thus kb implies 2 and by ki we can infer ka kb 2 now we can proceed with the crux of the argument deducing a contradiction from the assumption kakb assume kakb from kd and ka kb 2 it follows that ka 2 it is one of our logical truths ke that kb so from ki we conclude that ka kb by kd and our assumption that kakb this implies ka and in particular by kd again that ka 1 2 since we know that ka 2 it follows from kd that ka 1 but since ka is true is true by ke and in particular its first disjunct 1 ka 1 is true then from ka 1 we deduce 1 from ke and hence ka 1 a contradiction this shows that certain plausible assumptions about knowledge ki kd and ke together with the assumption that the students know that they will know the content of the announcement throughout the week are inconsistent pointing out to the students that they are making these internally inconsistent assumptions about knowledge is enough to dissolve the paradox we do not necessarily have to decide which assumption is the wrong one it is still interesting however to see if one of the assumptions appears to be a particu larly promising candidate for rejection perhaps the most popular candidate has been the assumption that after hearing the announcement the students know the content of the 8 announcement those who maintain that we can never know things by authority or that we can never know things about the future at least not with the same certainty that we can know many other things naturally find this approach attractive however even those who are less skeptical have reason to reject the assumption because the statement that the students are supposed to know is a statement that says something about the students inability to know certain things for comparison consider the statement it is raining but john doe does not know that it is raining clearly john doe cannot know the content of this statement even if the statement is true and it is uttered in his hearing by an extraordinarily reliable source this curious phenomenon is known as a moore paradox or a blindspot and the surprise exam paradox may be viewed as simply a more intricate version of this situation the easiest way to see the connection is to reduce the length of the week to one day so that the announcement becomes there will be an exam tomorrow but you do not know that this approach is essentially the one offered in 3 6 18 21 22 24 and 29 others have argued that the assumption kakb is plausible only if one invokes the temporal retention principle the students know that they will not forget the announce ment during the week or hintikka s kk principle if one knows something then one knows that one knows it and that one or both of these assumptions should be discarded i do not discuss this in detail here since i feel it is of limited mathematical interest but i mention a brilliant variation of the paradox concocted by sorensen 28 which suggests that rejecting these assumptions may be missing the point exactly one of five students art bob carl don and eric is to be given an exam the teacher lines them up alphabetically so that each student can see the backs of the students ahead of him in alphabetical order but not the students after him the students are shown four silver stars and one gold star then one star is secretly put on the back of each student the teacher announces that the gold star is on the back of the student who must take the exam and that that student will be surprised in the sense that he will not know he has been designated until they break formation the students argue that this is impossible eric cannot be designated because if he were he would see four silver stars and would know that he was designated the rest of the argument proceeds in the familiar way the significance of this variation is that in our preceding formalization we can let ka mean art knows and kb mean bob knows and then kakb appears to be immediately plausible without reference to time or the kk principle thus the problem remains even if those principles are rejected see 28 and 16 for more discussion a very interesting variant of the epistemological approach that of kaplan and mon tague 15 is a kind of hybrid of the logical and epistemological schools they prove a theorem called the paradox of the knower that is reminiscent of tarski s theorem on the indefinability of the truth predicate suppose we we have a first order language and we wish to introduce a knowledge predicate k there are certain reasonable sounding conditions that we might want to place on k 9 a k q q b a is known i e k a c if q can be proved from p and k p then k q unfortunately these assumptions cannot be satisfied using a diagonalization argument we can construct a sentence s such that s k s and then derive a contradiction by substituting this s for q and a for p in a b and c thus no such knowledge predicate is possible one might think at first that c is the dubious assumption since certainly nobody knows all the logical consequences of what he knows but c can be weakened to the assumption that the logical conclusion of a particular explicitly given proof is known so the theorem is quite a strong one the paradox of the knower has inspired some sophisticated work in logic see 1 2 or 13 4 game theory some authors have made the fascinating suggestion that the surprise exam paradox may be related to the iterated prisoner s dilemma the prisoner s dilemma is a two player game in which each player has the choice of either defecting or cooperating and must make the choice without communicating with the other player and without prior knowledge of the other player s choice if one player defects and the other player cooperates then the defector enjoys a large payoff and the cooperator suffers a large loss if both players defect then both payoffs are zero and if both players cooperate then they both earn a moderate payoff it is easy to show that each player has a dominant strategy i e one that is better than any other strategy regardless of the opponent s strategy to defect intuitively defection is the best choice because the prisoner s dilemma is a one shot game there is no incentive for players to build up a cooperative relationship since they are guaranteed never to meet again this suggests considering the iterated prisoner s dilemma in which there are n rounds instead of just one and the fact that there are exactly n rounds is public knowledge the payoffs in each round are as in the usual prisoner s dilemma and the two players are still not allowed to communicate with each other but at each round they do know and remember the results of all previous rounds one might think that in this case occasional cooperation would be superior to invariable defection the idea being that a cooperative move in an early stage even if the opponent defects encourages future cooperation that counterbalances earlier losses consider the following surprise examination argument that even in the n round prisoner s dilemma the optimal strategy is invariable defection the last round of an iterated prisoner s dilemma is identical to the one shot prisoner s dilemma since there is no hope of future cooperation hence the optimal last round strategy is to defect but since defection in the last round is certain there is no incentive in the penultimate round to 10 cooperate for doing so cannot possibly encourage future cooperation thus the optimal strategy in the penultimate round is also defection proceeding by induction we conclude that perfect players always defect the analogy between this argument and the standard surprise examination argument is quite striking at first indeed sorensen 30 has argued that the two are really the same and has substantially revised his analysis of the surprise exam as a result there is however an important disanalogy in the iterated prisoner s dilemma the conclusion about invariable defection is counterintuitive but it does not lead to an explicit contradiction it is not difficult to adapt our argument to give a fully rigorous mathematical proof that in the iterated prisoner s dilemma a nash equilibrium is possible only if both players defect in every round see 12 p 166 a nash equilibrium is a situation in which if the strategies of all but one player are held fixed that player cannot do better by changing strategies one reason that the surprise exam argument we presented is not rigorous as it stands is that the word optimal is imprecise a nash equilibrium is a precise concept that captures some though not all of the connotations of the word optimal therefore i believe that the iterated prisoner s dilemma is essentially distinct from the surprise examination paradox and is not just a variant see 23 nevertheless one might be able to exploit the parallel between the surprise examina tion and the iterated prisoner s dilemma to obtain some new ideas for game theory after all cooperation is observed in the real world and this suggests that the usual mathemat ical model of the iterated prisoner s dilemma might ignore some crucial point for some interesting ideas in this direction see 17 finally i want to mention an unpublished idea of karl narveson that illustrates how the surprise exam paradox can inspire new mathematics a teacher gives a quiz every week with probability p 1 on monday p 2 on tuesday and so on the teacher s goal is to find a probability distribution that maximizes the absolute value of the expected surprise when the quiz is announced here surprise is based on shannon entropy so the surprise on monday is log p 1 the surprise on tuesday is the log of the probability that the exam occurs on tuesday given that it has not occurred on monday and so on until friday when the quiz becomes a certainty and its announcement no longer comes as a surprise let qn m be the probability that the exam occurs on the nth to the last day of an m day week given that it has not occurred on any previous days where n ranges from zero to m 1 as one can easily show the optimal value of qn m is independent of m so we drop the second subscript now set s 0 0 narveson has shown that qn is given by the mutual recursions qn exp sn 1 1 sn sn 1 qn 11 the p s may then be recovered from the q s for a five day week the probabilities for each of the five days are about 0 1620 0 1654 0 1713 0 1844 and 0 3169 5 further reading the literature contains a wide variety of other approaches to the surprise examination paradox cargile 5 is the first paper in the literature to mention game theory clark 7 remarks that strictly mathematical analyses of the surprise exam are rare in the literature and he tries to fill this gap smullyan 27 weaves go del s theorem brainteasers the surprise exam and other epistemic and doxastic paradoxes into a delightful tapestry some have seen connections between the surprise exam and the sorites paradox remov ing one

formally published them in the end i decided to exclude unpublished items from this bibliography though i did allow for dissertations such as mar and electronic publications such as so 13 other papers were primarily concerned with some other topic and made only passing reference to the paradox or used the paradox just as an illustrative example of something these papers i evaluated on a case by case basis and made a personal judgment call i decided to include ald cuo da 1 da 2 fas gin gra h h kl 1 kl 2 l k and whr but omitted a number of others specifically i decided that the kaplan montague paradox of the knower was distinct from the surprise examination paradox and i even went back and deleted some entries that i had included in previous versions of my bibliography that were concerned only with the paradox of the knower following my previous practice i included books that contained a substantial discussion of the paradox even if most of the book was devoted to other topics in this category were cv 2 cv 3 kim so 12 and t h and of course i documented a steady stream of new publications on the paradox cv 1 dk 1 dk 2 f b ge 2 g c hu hua kna k r lvy gs prr sav s w va z wm 1 wm 2 and

addition to the acknowledgments that i made in previous versions of this bibliography i would like to thank sandy lemberg and arthur benjamin for notifying 14 me about some of the new references above
