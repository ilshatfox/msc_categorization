mutual interpretability 5 1 mutual interpretability of robinson arithmetic and adjunctive set theory with extensionality zlatan damnjanovic university of southern california abstract an elementary theory of concatenation qt is introduced and used to establish mutual interpretability of robinson arithmetic minimal predicative set theory quantifier free part of kirby s finitary set theory and adjunctive set theory with or without extensionality 2 the theory q also known as robinson arithmetic described in sec 12 below is often singled out as of special interest in foundational arguments for different reasons in textbook presentations of g del s incompleteness theorems and related undecidability results q is introduced as a minimal formal deductive framework allowing for arithmetical representation of formalized syntax and definition of basic concepts of recursion theory furnishing an example of a finitely axiomatizable yet essentially undecidable theory see e g 16 mathematically it appears to be extremely weak even though addition and multiplication are present their most basic properties such as associativity and commutativity cannot be formally proved in it this is hardly surprising considering that induction is not included among the axioms nonetheless the notion of a theory relatively interpretable in q in the sense explained e g in 16 proved to be surprisingly rich and of great independent interest in connection with a philosophically motivated neo formalist program put forward by edward nelson see 12 nelson s position is sometimes also described as strict predicativism by a theorem of wilkie the absence of induction among the axioms of q does not preclude the possibility of interpreting in q a fragment of peano arithmetic i 0 where induction is restricted to formulas with bounded quantifiers this allows recovery via the interpretation of all the usual 3 arithmetical laws additionally an impressive amount of non trivial mathematics can be reconstructed in theories interpretable in q including first order euclidean geometry elementary theory of the real closed fields i e first order theory of real numbers as well as basic feasible analysis formalizing elementary properties of real numbers and continuous functions see 4 for details it is frequently pointed out that q is a minimal element in the well ordered hierarchy of interpretability of natural mathematical theories it was tarski who first noted that as regards self referential constructions at the heart of meta mathematical arguments for incompleteness the procedure of arithmetization by means of which the syntax of formal theories is coded up by numbers amounts to an unnecessary detour in his seminal work on the concept of truth of formalized languages tarski introduced a theory of concatenated strings to demonstrate this point this idea was further developed by quine 13 more recently grzegorczyk has suggested that a theory of concatenated texts would form a natural framework for the study of incompleteness phenomena and more generally computation and for this purpose he introduced a weak theory of concatenation tc and proved its 4 undecidability 6 work of several authors has since revealed an intimate connection between tc and q the two theories turn out to be mutually interpretable as established independently by visser and sterken 19 ganea 5 and vejdar 15 for a thorough discussion of interpretability in connection with these theories see 19 we approach these issues from a somewhat different angle is there a comparably minimal theory of sets that is deductively equipollent in the sense of mutual interpretability to q this problem has a long and interesting history a hint of a positive answer was provided by szmielew and tarski in 1950 who announced in 14 interpretability of q in a very weak fragment of set theory called adjunctive set theory with extensionality ast ext this theory is described in sec 5 below the result was restated in 16 p 34 but no proof was published collins and halpern did produce a proof in 1970 said to be approved of by tarski see 2 in 1990 an interpretation of q in ast dispensing with extensionality was outlined in appendix iii of 10 by mycielski pudl k and stern in 1994 montagna and mancini who seem not to have been aware of 2 and 10 showed that q is interpretable in an extension of ast they call minimal predicative set theory n the theory n 5 was said to be suggested to them by nelson with a constant for the empty set a binary relation symbol and a binary function symbol for set adjunction x tyu but without extensionality see 11 this theory is described in sec 14 below a new proof of interpretability of q in ast was given in visser 18 and also in a somewhat different setting in burgess 1 the reverse problem of interpreting ast in q appears more vexing because of the paucity of resources available in q for set construction for discussion of the important notion of sequential theory broadly relevant in this connection see 8 10 and especially the works of visser 17 and 19 one path would be to try to think of sets in terms of numbers and then model set building operations in this case adjunction arithmetically modulo a sufficiently elementary coding relying on bounded induction in a suitable extension of i 0 known to be interpretable in q such as e g i 0 1 to set up the needed interpretation indeed along these lines one can obtain an interpretation of a version of adjunctive set theory without extensionality in q this was essentially accomplished by nelson in 12 we follow a different tack building on some ideas of quine we propose to think of sets in terms of strings and of adjunction as concatenation or juxtaposition of certain 6 kinds of strings we introduce a weak theory of concatenation qt different from grzegorczyk s tc to intermediate between adjunctive set theory and q our approach will turn out to have the unexpected philosophical benefit of allowing us to understand both arithmetic and set theory as just forms of concatenation theory the theory qt or rather its definitional extension qt will serve as an interpretive framework for set adjunction while qt can in turn be interpreted in i 0 it can be shown independently that q is directly interpretable in qt here we confront two principal challenges in the absence of induction in qt to establish the relevant facts about the coding of sets of strings by strings needed to carry out the interpretation and secondly to ensure that the resulting interpretation validates the extensionality axiom for sets the simultaneous solution of these two problems yields our interpretation of ast ext in qt since i 0 is interpretable in q and as shown in sec 11 below qt is interpretable in i 0 this suffices to establish mutual interpretability of ast ext and q 7 some authors prefer to formalize set adjunction using an adjunction operator represented by a primitive binary function symbol for x tyu rather than relying on the logical apparatus of the first order language of set theory x t u one such formulation called ps for peano set theory proposed by kirby in 9 is intended to serve as an axiomatization of the first order theory of hereditarily finite sets analogously to how first order peano arithmetic can be introduced as an extension of q by means of the induction schema over the language t 0 u of arithmetic ps is presented as a system ps 0 consisting of a handful of quantifier free axioms extended by an induction schema expressed in terms of the adjunction operator the axioms of the system n of minimal predicative set theory of montagna and mancini are included among those of ps 0 which is described below in sec 14 we establish that robinson arithmetic minimal predicative set theory kirby s quantifier free finitary set theory and adjunctive set theory with or without extensionality are all relatively interpretable in each other each being mutually interpretable with concatenation theory qt thus fundamentally the most basic arithmetic and simplest set theory turn out to be variants of one and the same theory 8 our arguments requires construction of formulas with certain special properties and tedious formal verifications of those properties while we provide the reader with sufficient indications how these constructions can be carried out the complete details are given in 3 the author is grateful to the anonymous referee for very helpful comments 1 a theory of concatenation we consider a first order theory with identity and a single binary function symbol informally we let the variables range over nonempty strings of a s and b s or 0 s and 1 s and let x y be the string that consists of the digits of the string x followed by the digits of string y subject to the following conditions qt 1 x y z x y z qt 2 x y a x y b qt 3 x a y a x y x b y b x y a x a y x y b x b y x y qt 4 a x b y x a y b qt 5 x a v x b v y a y x v b y x z z a x v z b x 9 it is convenient to have a function symbol for a successor operation on strings qt 6 sx y x a y b v x a x b y of course we may also think of a single letter a appended to x x a as a successor of the string x since the last axiom is basically a definition adding it to the other five results in an inessential i e conservative extension we call the resulting theory qt first let s introduce some obvious abbreviations xby z x z y and xey z z x y also let x py x y v xby v xey v y 1 y 2 y y 1 x y 2 often we write xy for x y and omit parentheses in x yz and xy z on account of qt 1 for philosophical reasons and at a slight cost of increase in complexity of definitions such as those just given we do not include the empty string it can be shown however that concatenation theory with the empty string and one without are mutually interpretable see 7 let xry x a y a v xby 10 then we can prove see 3 pp 13 17 qt xr sx qt sxysy xyy qt xra xya arx qt xry yrz xrz qt xr sy xry v xyy these elementary facts tell us that provably in qt xry v xyy is a discrete preordering of strings still our theory looks exceedingly weak 2 tractable strings consider the following problem we know that neither a nor b are their own initial segments qt ara and qt brb but we don t know whether our theory proves that no string is an initial segment of itself qt x xrx 11 let s look at this more carefully consider the property i 0 y x xry v x y xrx both a and b have this property qt i 0 a and qt i 0 b by definition no string in i 0 is its own initial segment qt i 0 x xrx let us call i 0 strings tractable so a and b are tractable it may be that not all strings are tractable but we are going to be working with those that are to begin together with transitivity of the relation r we have that delivers anti symmetry for tractable strings 3 2 2 qt i 0 x xry yrx so our theory proves that tractable strings form a discrete partial ordering under r with a as the least element write x y for i 0 x i 0 y xry as usual x y stands for x y v x y 12 let us summarize theorem 0 1 qt x i 0 a x 2 qt x y z i 0 x y y z x z 3 qt x i 0 x sx x sx 4 qt x y i 0 x sy x y v x sy 5 qt x y i 0 sx sy x y 6 qt x y i 0 x y y x x y we write x k for x k x this relativization notation will prove to be convenient 3 string concepts other than a and b which strings are tractable we don t know yet for instance whether according to our theory the tractable strings are closed under the successor operations on strings it turns out that they are 3 pp 18 21 qt i 0 x i 0 sx and qt i 0 x i 0 x a formulae with this property will be of special interest to us 13 in general we call a formula i x in the language of concatenation theory a string concept if provably in qt it holds of the letter a and hereditarily w r to both successor operations qt i a qt x i x i sx and qt x i x i x a note that if i 1 x and i 2 x are string concepts so is their conjunction now i 0 x is a string concept of course so is x x but not knowing whether our theory proves that every string is tractable whether qt x xrx we didn t have the analogue of that no string to which the concept applies is its own initial segment which gave us 3 and 6 in theorem 0 in fact qt x xrx a countermodel exists consider for example a model m of qt with an infinite word w m where w bb bbaabb bbaabb bb which begins and ends with an infinite sequence of b s and has midsegments bbaabb that begin and end with an infinite sequence of b s and form a countable dense linear ordering without endpoints then x m where x abb bbaabb bbaabb bba 14 so that awa x by a theorem of cantor there is a 1 1 order preserving map from x onto any of its proper initial segments that end with ba so m x x x and thus m xbx therefore qt x xbx 4 simulating induction let s see how string concepts can help us cope with the apparent deductive weakness of our concatenation theory our theory does not include an axiom or schema of induction is there some way to rely on reasoning about string concepts to derive non trivial universal conclusions about strings let s consider an example axiom qt 3 gives us left and right cancellation of atoms what about right cancellation for all strings z x y x z y z x y suppose we have a string concept i such that right cancellation holds for some string u i 15 hyp u x y i x uyy u xyy what about its b successor the string u b can we cancel it note that we do have for x y i x u b yy u b x u by y u b x uyy u xyy by qt 1 qt 3 and hyp u likewise with a thus qt x y i x uyy u xyy x y i x u b yy u b xyy and likewise for a successors but this doesn t entitle us to conclude that z i x y i x zyy z xyy what if z happens to be an infinite string one that cannot be obtained from an atom by repeatedly concatenating b or a nothing guarantees that such a string if it exists will in fact be cancellable so we cannot claim based on our theory that all i strings are right cancellable suppose we contemplate a new string concept j z using the very formula that we want to come out universally true 16 j z i z x y i x zyy z xyy it is easy to see that the new predicate holds for a likewise for b qt j b now assume j z and let x z a yy z a then x z ay y z a by qt 1 but then x zyy z by qt 3 whence xyy by hypothesis j z on the other hand from j z we have i z and given that i is a string concept i z a therefore qt z j z j z a completely analogously qt z j z j z b here is the point obviously that all j strings are right cancellable qt z j x y j x zyy z xyy follows from the definition but now we know that j is a string concept 17 if we take i to be i 0 then we now know that among the tractable strings those with the right cancellation property include not only a and b but are also provably in our theory closed under both successor operations we established this by refining the given string concept i then formulating the universal proposition for the resulting predicate j and then proving that j is a string concept to summarize faced with the prospect that the property of right cancellability may not hold universally for arbitrary i strings z we still managed to legitimately universalize by selecting those among i strings that do have the property we did this simply by writing out the appropriate condition that strengthens i to j expressing the claim that the right cancellation can hold universally for i strings in principle albeit only for those namely j strings that also satisfy the extra condition our theory guarantees that such strings are plentiful because as we saw in the above formal argument qt proves that j is a string concept if i is if i strings have been selected from i 0 i e tractable strings this opens up the possibility of discovering other general properties of right cancellable tractable strings by strengthening these conditions by further requirements 18 some people may feel that this is cheating that universalizing by strengthening is not really induction because the new string concept j is not the same as the old one i and not all i strings may in fact be j strings if you feel that way feel free to call it quasi induction or simulated induction this procedure will allow us to simulate induction in our concatenation theory without explicitly assuming it 5 formula selection further illustrated our ability to exploit the extremely meager deductive resources of qt has been potentially amplified by the knowledge that new universal statements such as the one given in can be proved in qt in a form relativized to a suitably selected string concept we should note that the condition of right cancellability was in logical terms simple enough that we could count on qt to deliver the needed conclusion that j is a string concept to deal with other more complex conditions it will turn out to be useful to know that the restricting condition j has some additional features 19 do we know that the strings in i 0 are closed under we don t we need a string concept with that property closure under concatenation there is a string concept i 1 such that qt x y i 1 x i 1 y i 1 x y where qt x i 1 x i 0 x let i 1 x i 0 x y i 0 y i 0 y x we need to verify that i 1 x is indeed a string concept first that qt i 1 a we have qt i 0 a suppose i 0 y then i 0 y a because i 0 is closed under sa provably in qt so indeed qt i 1 a as for qt i 1 b that follows from qt i 0 a and the closure of i 0 under s next we show that qt z i 1 z i 1 z b so suppose i 1 z we want i 1 z b we have i 0 z from the hypothesis i 1 z and so i 0 z b since i 0 is a string concept assume that i 0 y from the hypothesis i 1 z it then follows that i 0 y z and further that i 0 y z b by qt 1 this means that i 0 y z b so we have established that y i 0 y i 0 y z b 20 which along with the previously obtained i 0 z b gives us i 1 z b under the hypothesis i 1 z as required similarly qt z i 1 z i 1 z a this completes the argument that i 1 x is a string concept but we also need to that i 1 is actually closed under the concatenation operation that is qt x y i 1 x i 1 y i 1 x y assume i 1 x and i 1 y namely a i 0 x z i 0 z i 0 z x and b i 0 y z i 0 z i 0 z y from i 0 x and b we obtain i 0 x y assume now i 0 z then i 0 z x by a and further i 0 z x y by b but then i 0 z x y by qt 1 so we have that i 0 x y z i 0 z i 0 z x y that is i 1 x y this is precisely what we needed to show note that we have not used any property specific to i 0 as a string concept in the above argument say that a string concept i is stronger than i 0 if qt x i x i 0 x and write i i 0 we have in fact proved something 21 more general for any string concept i i 0 there is a string concept j i such that qt x y j x j y j x y similarly we can ensure that a given string concept is also downward closed with respect to the relation among tractable strings downward closure under suppose j i is a string concept where i i 0 then there is a string concept j j such that qt x j x y x j y let j x y x j y we write y x for y y x that the formula j x has the required property is immediate from the definition and transitivity of we have qt j a by hypothesis and qt y a y a so qt j a suppose m j x then m y x j y suppose m y sx then y sx y x v y sx if y x we have j y from the hypothesis j x if y sx then j x from the hypothesis j x whence j sx from the principal hypothesis therefore y sx j y that is j sx that j x is 22 closed under sa is proved in the same fashion this completes the argument that j x is a string concept more generally we have downward closure under substrings for any string concept i i 0 there is a string concept j i such that qt x j y y px j y let i p x i x z x y y pz i y and let j i p for qt j a note that qt i a since i is a string concept and qt y pa y a from qt 2 hence qt y y pa i y but this suffices for qt j a because qt z a z a likewise qt j b where we need only note that qt z b z a v z b and appeal to qt i b suppose j x if x a we have sx b and so j sx by what we just proved 23 otherwise sx x b suppose zisx and let y pz it is sufficient to consider the two cases zix and z sx if zix then i y follows from the hypothesis j x so let z sx x b then by definition y px b y x b v yb x b v ye x b v x 1 x 2 x 1 yx 2 x b of the four we only consider the last see 3 3 13 for the rest x 1 yx 2 x b then b x 2 v bex 2 by qt 4 and qt 5 then x 1 yx 2 x 1 yb or x 2 x 1 yx 2 x 1 y x 2 b whence xb x 1 yb or xb x 1 y x 2 b but then x x 1 y or x x 1 yx 2 by qt 3 in either case y px and we have i y from the hypothesis j x we thus have m y y psx i y which is what was needed to show that zisx y y pz i y so we proved that j sx if j x as required that j x is closed under sa is established in a similar fashion hence j x is indeed a string concept with the required properties 24 this means that in establishing that a given string concept i may be strengthened to a string concept j with another property we need not worry whether the formula j x is also closed with respect to or downward closed with respect to i or p as we just saw we can always strengthen j x to one that is this is of crucial importance in the formal arguments that we ll be using below in particular to ensure closure of string concepts under certain kinds of existential claims 6 adjunctive set theory let us now consider a very simple set theory probably the simplest that comes to mind consisting of the following two principles null x y y x adj x y z w w z w x v w y formally we take null and adj along with the usual axioms for identity to determine a first order theory adjunctive set theory ast formulated in the language x 25 by extending ast with ext x y z z x z y xyy as an additional axiom we obtain adjunctive set theory with extensionality ast ext we want to interpret the language x in a very concrete way we would like to be able to think of the variables as ranging over non empty strings of a s and b s or 0 s and 1 s and we want to think of set membership as the relation of one string being a part or a substring of another string for example if xyaa and yybaab then x is a member of y x y because x is part of y y b aa b or something like that 7 coding sets by strings in 13 quine introduced a method for representing sequences of positive integers by strings of this sort if we let a tally of n consecutive b s stand for n 0 an ordered pair i j is represented by the string b bab b consisting of i 26 many b s followed by a single a and then j many b s then a sequence of ordered pairs i 1 j 1 i 2 j 2 in jn can be represented by the juxtaposition aaw 1 aaw 2 aa aawnaa of the representations of the pairs separated by aa this gives us a coding of finite sets of positive integers or pairs of positive integers by finite binary strings made possible by the fact that we can use the a tallies aa as markers to separate off the members of the set but what if w 1 wn were not b tallies or pairs of b tallies but instead arbitrary strings of a s and b s here we are facing the problem that no single choice of some string as a marker would suffice because any such string could appear in any of wj s or can actually be one of them so how would we code sets of arbitrary binary strings by single strings suppose t is a b tally longer than any b tally occurring in w 1 wn interpose copies of t between the members as follows w taw 1 ataw 2 at awnat quine made three observations 27 i t s cannot occur in any wj because they are longer than any b tallies contained in them neither can any occurrences of t straddle any of those shown because they are separated by a s ii the only segments of the string w which are immediately preceded by ta and immediately followed by at and do not themselves contain any occurrences of t are w 1 wn iii if x is any string not containing any occurrence of t and if the string taxat occurs as a part of w then x must be one of w 1 wn quine then defines a string x to be a member of the set coded by a string w if the string taxat occurs as a part of w where t is the longest b tally in w x w t pw maxtb t w t px taxat pw here we let maxtb t w tallyb t t tallyb t t pw t pt where tallyb t y px digit y yyb and digit y xya v yya 28 this means that in principle the operation of string concatenation is all we need to be able to express the necessary and sufficient condition for a single binary string to represent a set of strings 8 step ladder coding note that it is not necessary to use a single b tally t longer than any b tally in the member strings to separate them off it will in fact be more convenient to use different b tally markers for this purpose for the string w t 1 aw 1 at 2 aw 2 at 3 to encode w 1 w 2 it will suffice for t 1 not to occur in w 1 for t 2 not to occur in w 2 etc with the additional requirement that the markers t 1 t 2 t 3 strictly increase in length the markers t 1 t 2 t 3 will serve to frame the members w 1 w 2 the coding works like a step ladder starting with the b tally that precedes the first occurrence of the letter a in w each next longer b tally is a successive step of the ladder marking off a frame that corresponds to another member of the coded set a similar idea was employed by visser in 19 29 more precisely let s define when a b tally t is longer than any b tally in x max tb t x maxtb t x t px we then define when a string u is a preframe indexed by t pref u t tallyb t y pu aya u max tb t u when t 1 ut 2 is the first frame in the string x firstf x t 1 u t 2 pref u t 1 tallyb t 2 t 1 t 2 t 1 ut 2 x v t 1 t 2 t 1 ut 2 a bx when t 1 ut 2 is the last frame in x lastf x t 1 u t 2 pref u t 1 tallyb t 2 t 1 t 2 t 1 ut 2 x v w wat 1 ut 2 x max tb t 1 w and when t 1 ut 2 is an intermediate frame in x immediately following an initial segment w of x intf x w t 1 u t 2 pref u t 1 tallyb t 2 t 1 t 2 w 1 wat 1 ut 2 aw 1 x max tb t 1 w we then define when a string u is t 1 t 2 framed in x fr x t 1 u t 2 firstf x t 1 u t 2 v w intf x w t 1 u t 2 v lastf x t 1 u t 2 we say that t 1 is the initial and t 2 terminal tally marker in the frame we then define t envelops x env t x to be the conjunction of the following five conditions a maxtb t x t is a longest b tally in x b u px t 1 t 2 firstf x t 1 u t 2 x has a first frame 30 c u px lastf x t u t x has a last frame with t as its initial and terminal marker d u px t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 fr x t 1 u t 2 fr x t 3 u t 4 t 1 yt 3 different initial tally markers frame distinct strings e u 1 u 2 px t t 1 t 2 fr x t u 1 t 1 fr x t u 2 t 2 u 1 yu 2 distinct strings are framed by different initial tally markers we then say x is a set code if x is aa or else x is enveloped by some b tally set x xyaa v t px env t x finally we say that a string y is a member of the set coded by string x if x is enveloped by some b tally t and the juxtaposition of the string y with single tokens of digit a is framed in x y x t px env t x u px t 1 t 2 fr x t 1 u t 2 uyaya now suppose a set of strings x is extended by adjoining a string y to obtain another set y y x tyu then a code for y can be picked so that a given code of x will be its initial segment to be clear so far we have been talking about codes of sets of strings informally various claims were made about properties of codings based on what we took to be obvious properties of concatenated strings what specific 31 assumptions about strings suffice to formally validate these claims it will pay off to make these assumptions as weak as possible we will show that modulo our methodology of formula selection all the necessary reasoning can be carried out in qt see 3 pp 89 263 9 interpreting adjunction we first focus on tallies we can show in qt that for a suitable string concept j call it itot tallies are totally or completely ordered with respect to 3 4 6 lemma on complete ordering of tallies for any string concept i i 0 there is a string concept j i such that qt z j x tallyb x tallyb z x z v z x similarly we can show that the concatenation operation is commutative on b tallies in a suitably defined string concept 3 4 10 32 following this basic methodology we can obtain progressively more refined string concepts that provably in our theory simultaneously have each one from a range of properties needed for our coding of sets to work a word of caution however is in order here many seemingly obviously true claims suggested by the formal definitions we gave in the previous section such as e g that tallies are closed concatenation the existence and uniqueness of a maximal tally in a given string the uniqueness of initial and last frames in a given set code etc become potentially problematic in the deductively weak setting such as that of qt in general not being provable in unrestricted form in qt they must be explicitly proved by selecting appropriate string concepts see e g 3 4 5 4 13 and 4 15 but after numerous auxiliary preparatory such steps it turns out that we can show that any string concept stronger than i 0 can be strengthened to one that is closed under set adjunction of strings 3 7 1 set adjunction lemma for any string concept i i 0 there is a string concept j i such that qt x y j set x z j set z w w z w x v w y 33 on the other hand from the definitions of the coding scheme we gave earlier qt z set z z aa v y y z z aa y y z 9 we can derive that the string aa codes the empty set 39 5 18 the null set lemma qt z set z z aa y y z let the predicate set x apply to the set codes among the strings in j set x j x set x where j is obtained from i 0 as in the set adjunction lemma we define a map on atomic formulae of the language of set theory x as follows x y 9 set x x y and x y 9 x y if we let the formula set x define the domain of the interpretation and extend the map to non atomic formulae in the usual way then the translations of null and adj x y y x 9 and x y z w w z w x v w y 9 are easily derived 39 13 1 and 13 2 we have that qt x set x y set y set y y x 34 and from the set adjunction lemma that qt x y set x set y z set z w set w set w w z set w w x v w y we thus obtain a formal interpretation of adjunctive set theory ast in qt 10 canonical set codes so far we have ignored extensionality it is easy to see that under the coding scheme we adopted one and the same set of strings w 1 wn can have different set codes as we form a string that codes the set we may take up the members in a different order or else we may use a different pick of tally markers t 1 t 2 t 3 to separate the members furthermore a set code for w 1 wn may contain as substrings material xyz other than the framed strings w 1 wn t 1 aw 1 at 2 xyzt 3 aw 2 at 4 this is similar to the so called junk dna in the human genome 35 to validate extensionality we ll need to be able to associate a unique string as the canonical set code for strings w 1 wn let rtl z x y read z is the left root of x and y zabx v za x zbby v zb y v zbbx v zb x zaby v za y unless one of the strings x y is an initial segment of the other this says in effect z is the longest initial segment common to both x and y the existence when it exists and uniqueness of left root of given strings x and y must be proved by selecting appropriate string concepts see 3 6 2 and 6 3 left root lemma for any string concept i i 0 there is a string concept irtl i such that qt x irtl z zbx y xwy y a v y b v v abx bby v bbx aby v xby v ybx v z rtl z x y next we say that a string u lexically precedes a string v u v if u is or begins with the letter a and v is or begins with the letter b or else u is an initial 36 segment of v or else u and v have a left root z such that u is or begins with za and v is or begins with zb u a v abu v b v bbv v ubv v v z rtl z u v za u v zabu zb v v zbbv we then have 3 6 5 6 7 lexical precedence lemma 1 for any string concept i i 0 there is a string concept j i such that qt u v j u v v uyv v v u 2 for any string concept i i 0 there is a string concept j i such that qt v j u w u v v w u w 3 for any string concept i i 0 there is a string concept j i such that qt u v j u v v u let s define when a b tally t is a shortest b tally not occurring in string u minmax tb t u max tb t u t max tb t u t t 37 we can then establish that we can always obtain string concepts in which for every string there does exist a unique shortest b tally not occurring in that string 3 6 8 shortest non occurrent tally lemma for any string concept i i 0 there is a string concept j i such that qt x j t j minmax tb t x we read x k as x k x y k y y x we now introduce another relation the shortest b tally not in u is shorter than the shortest b tally not in v u tbv t 1 t 2 minmax tb t 1 u minmax tb t 2 v t 1 t 2 also we say when the shortest b tally not in u is the same as the shortest b tally not in v u tbv t 1 t 2 minmax tb t 1 u minmax tb t 2 v t 1 t 2 we can show that any two strings in an appropriately defined string concept are strictly comparable with respect to the shortest b tallies not occurring in them 3 8 1 38 lemma on comparability w r to the shortest non occurrent tally for any string concept i i 0 there is a string concept j i such that qt u v j u tbv v u tbv v v tbu u tbv v tbu we now order strings accordingly with the additional stipulation that the strings whose shortest non occurrent b tallies are the same are to be ordered according to lexical precedence we call this the tally modified lexicographic ordering u v u tbv v u tbv u v we then obtain 3 8 2 and 8 3 modified lexicographic order lemma 1 for any string concept i i 0 there is a string concept j i such that qt u v j u v v uyv v v u u v v u 2 for any string concept i i 0 there is a string concept j i such that qt v j u w u v v w u w 39 consider now some set code x strings u v that are members of the set coded by x are embedded in x within frames we say that u s frame precedes v s frame in x when either u s frame is the first frame in x or v s frame is the last frame in x or else both frames are intermediate and the initial tally marker of v s frame is not shorter than the terminal tally marker of u s frame we write u xv for t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 fr x t 1 aua t 2 fr x t 3 ava t 4 firstf x t 1 aua t 2 t 1 t 3 v lastf x t 3 ava t 4 t 1 t 3 v v w 1 intf x w 1 t 1 aua t 2 w 3 intf x w 3 t 3 ava t 4 t 2 t 3 we can now state one of the requirements for a set code to count as canonical the order in which the set members frames appear in the set s code will have to respect the members tally modified lexicographic ordering let lex z u v u zv u v call such set codes lexicographically ordered 40 let s turn now to the analogue of the no junk dna condition which is a minimality requirement on set codes we want to make sure that the string coding a given set contains nothing but the framed members of the set because tallies of b s serve as markers separating the set s members the key lies in where we allow the letter a to occur throughout the set code given that each frame is of the form t 1 auat 2 we ll let the digit a occur only immediately after an initial tally marker t 1 or immediately before a terminal tally marker t 2 or else within the framed string u we first define when an occurrence of a string z sandwiched between two substrings in x appears within a frame x is the result of juxtaposing w 1 to the left and w 2 to the right of z and either t 1 vt 2 is the first frame in x and the string w 1 is the b tally t 1 or t 1 v begins with or is the string w 1 z or else t 1 vt 2 is an intermediate or the last frame in x having some string w a as the initial segment of x immediately preceding it and the string w 1 is w at 1 or w 1 z is w at 1 v or results from juxtaposing some initial segment v 1 of v next to w a t 1 41 that is we write occ w 1 z w 2 x t 1 v t 2 for w 1 zw 2 x fr x t 1 v t 2 firstf x t 1 v t 2 t 1 w 1 v w 1 z b t 1 v v w 1 z t 1 v v v w intf x w t 1 v t 2 v lastf x t 1 v t 2 w at 1 vt 2 yx w at 1 yw 1 v v 1 v 1 bv w a t 1 v 1 yw 1 z v w at 1 vyw 1 z we call a set code minimal if every occurrence of the digit a appears within some frame write minset x for set x w 1 w 2 px w 1 aw 2 yx v px t t px occ w 1 a w 2 x t v t let s recall how our step ladder coding works given strings w 1 w 2 we select tally markers t 1 t 2 t 3 for the corresponding frames to obtain w y t 1 aw 1 at 2 aw 2 at 3 the tally markers are strictly increasing in length we have to make sure that the initial tally marker for a string s frame is longer than any b tally in that frame and also longer than any initial tally marker corresponding to frames that precede that string s frame in the code 42 but this leaves us free to make the initial tally markers as large as we want for canonical set codes we require that the b tallies used as initial markers be shortest possible for a string v in a given set of strings to be coded first we state the condition a b tally t must meet to serve as a possible initial tally marker for v s frame in some set code x the b tally t should be longer than the initial tally marker of any frame that precedes v s frame in x write max t v x for set x v x tallyb t u t 1 t 2 px fr x t 1 aua t 2 u xv t 1 t we then require that t be the shortest such tally let mmax tb t v x max t v x t max t v x max tb t v tit we call set codes in which each frame has as its initial tally marker a b tally that uniquely satisfies this condition special let special x set x v t 1 t 2 fr x t 1 ava t 2 mmax tb t 1 v x 43 if we let mean that the sets coded by x and y have the same strings as members x y set x set y w w x w y we then have the special set codes lemma which says that we can choose a string concept in which for set codes that are both lexicographically ordered and special the members of the coded sets uniquely determine the initial tally markers of their frames 3 10 2 special set codes lemma for any string concept i i 0 there is a string concept j i such that qt x y j lex x lex y special x special y x y fr x t 1 aua t 2 fr y t 3 aua t 4 t 1 t 3 we call a set code canonical if its lexicographically ordered minimal and special set x minset x lex x special x we then have 3 11 4 44 the uniqueness lemma for any string concept i i 0 there is a string concept j i such that qt x y j set x set y x y xyy sets that have the same strings as members have the same canonical set code 11 interpreting extensionality the uniqueness lemma will be an essential element in our interpretation of ext but we simultaneously have to make sure that adj also holds strong set adjunction lemma there is a formula v set such that qt x y v x v y z v z w w z w x v w y in contrast to the version of the set adjunction lemma we used earlier to interpret ast without ext here the canonical code z produced by adjunction cannot be obtained simply by tacking on a frame for the adjoined string at the tail end of the set code x for the original set the canonical code for the expanded set has to be reconfigured using a suitable selection of initial tally 45 markers depending on how the new member y lexicographically relates to the members of the original set the proof of the strong set adjunction lemma requires that we consider the whole variety of cases that arise in this connection see 3 12 2 from the proof we can extract a rather lengthy formula x y z in the language of qt for which we obtain see 3 pp 646 650 strong set adjunction lemma explicit form qt x y v x v y z v z x y z z x y z w w z w x v w y x y x y x now we are ready to set up our formal interpretation we ll let the formula v x define the domain we write x y x and y code the same set modulo v for z v z z x z y we interpret atomic formulae of the language of set theory x as follows x y x y and x y x y we then extend the map to non atomic formulae in the usual way 46 relativizing the quantifiers to v then the translation of null x y y x is proved in the same way as the translation x y y x earlier on the other hand from the strong set adjunction lemma we show that qt x v x y v y z v z y z w v w w x w z w v w w z w x v v v v v w v y but this is the translation of a formula equivalent to the adjunction axiom qt x y z y z w w x w z w w z w x v w y finally note that x v x y v y z v z z x z y z v z z x z y is in fact the translation x y z z x z y x y of the extensionality axiom hence qt ext holds trivially so our concatenation theory qt also interprets adjunctive set theory with extensionality ast ext see 3 pp 662 663 47 theorem 1 ast ext i qt 12 concatenation arithmetically represented the arithmetical theory q known as robinson arithmetic is formulated in the first order language 0 with the universal closures of the following non logical axioms q 1 x 0 q 2 x y x y q 3 x 0 v y y x q 4 x 0 x q 5 x y x y q 6 x 0 0 q 7 x y x y x now qt can be interpreted in the arithmetical theory 48 i 0 q 0 x x sx x x x 0 where x is any bounded formula in the same language 0 i e formula with no unbounded quantifiers but possibly with parameters other than x in i 0 it is possible to define a coding of sequences of numbers and a corresponding concatenation operation specifically there is i a bounded formula seq x that defines the set of numbers that serve as the codes of sequences of numbers including a code for the empty sequence ii a bounded predicate x y expressing the relation x is a term of the sequence coded by y iii a polynomially bounded function x y that yields the code of the concatenation of two sequences the sequence whose terms are the terms of the sequence coded by x followed by the terms of the sequence coded by y provided seq x and seq y otherwise x y 0 we let seq x seq x y y x y y x y s 0 v y ss 0 then the predicate seq x defines the set of codes of nonempty dyadic sequences i e sequences of 1 s and or 2 s that is we have t 0 i 0 s seq s 49 t 1 i 0 s seq s x x s x c 1 t 2 i 0 s seq s x x s x c 2 t 3 i 0 seq s seq t u seq u s t u t 4 i 0 seq s seq t seq u s t u s t u t 5 i 0 seq s seq t s t c

t s v c 2 t s t seq t t c 1 s v t c 2 s here c 1 and c 2 are variable free terms that are the codes of the singleton sequences that consist of 1 and 2 respectively in particular t 4 t 9 verify the axioms of qt in i 0 this determines an interpretation of concatenation theory qt in i 0 since qt is interpretable in qt this also establishes theorem 2 qt i i 0 but i 0 is known to be interpretable in q by a theorem of wilkie see 8 hence we also have theorem 3 qt i q 50 13 all the pieces fall into place by tarski and szmielew collins and halpern and mycielski pudl k and stern who dispensed with extensionality q is relatively interpretable in adjunctive set theory ast so q i ast whereas in theorem 1 we have shown that ast ext i qt this closes the circle it follows that q qt ast and ast ext are all mutually interpretable first mutual interpretability theorem q i qt i ast i ast ext 14 adjunction in functional form quantifier free finitary set theory the theory ps 0 introduced by kirby in

3 x y z x z y ps 4 x y z x y x z x v z y where we write x y z for x y z if we let x y x y x we may informally express the meaning of ps 1 ps 4 in more familiar notation as x y x tyu x y z x z y z x tyu z x v z y ps 0 may be thought of as a minimal theory of the adjunction operation x tyu note that ps 2 ps 3 x z x v z y x y z x y for assume z y then x y z x y y x y by ps 2 hence ps 2 z y x y z x y assume x z x then x z y x z y x y but x z y x y z by ps 3 so x y z x y 52 hence ps 3 x z x x y z x y therefore ps 2 ps 3 x z x v z y x y z x y as claimed in more familiar notation ps 2 ps 3 z x v z y z x y minimal predicative set theory n studied by montagna and mancini in 11 amounts to taking ps 1 and ps 4 as sole non logical axioms along with the usual axioms for identity for our purpose it will be convenient to reformulate ps 0 as a first order theory ps 0 in the language 0 s where 0 is an individual constant and s a ternary relation symbol satisfying the following conditions ps 1 s 0 x

formula v x from the strong set adjunction lemma to define the domain of the interpretation we let the string aa interpret the constant 0 and let 53 s x y z x y z where x y z is as in the explicit form of the strong set adjunction lemma let x y x y then we can verify i qt v x s 0 x 0 assume v x suppose for a reductio that aa x aa by the strong set adjunction lemma w w aa w aa v w x whence x aa x aa v x x but qt x aa as noted in the null set lemma since x x v x aa this is a contradiction therefore aa x aa that is m s 0 x 0 hence v x aa x aa ii qt v x v y v z 1 v z 2 s x y z 1 s z 1 y z 2 z 1

of the strong set adjunction lemma we have that y z 1 but then z 1 z 2 from z 1 y z 2 hence we have v x v y v z 1 v z 2 x y z 1 z 1 y z 2 z 1 z 2 that is qt v x v y v z 1 v z 2 s x y z 1 s z 1 y z 2 z

that w w z 2 w z 1 v w z w x v w y v w z w x v w z v w y w z 3 v w y w z 4 that is z 2 z 4 but from v z 2 v z 4 we have set z 2 set z 4 hence by the uniqueness lemma z 2 z 4 which suffices to prove the claim iv qt v x v y v z v w s x y z s z w z s x w x v w y 55 assume v x v y v z v w along with x y z z w z from the strong set adjunction lemma we have v v z w x v v y and v v z v z v v w also w z assume that m w y then w x but then x w x as required v qt v x v y z v z s x y z vi qt v x v y v z 1 v z 2 s x y z 1 s x y z 2 z 1 yz 2 this follows immediately from the strong set adjunction lemma with i vi we have derived ps 0 i qt let us now consider extensionality in this setting the axioms of ps 0 ext are those of ps 0 together with ext x y z s x z x s y z y x y again let v x define the domain of the interpretation where 0 aa and s x y z x y z 56 let x y x y where x y z v z z x z y we then argue just as in i ii that i qt v x s 0 x 0 ii qt v x v y v z 1 v z 2 s x y z 1 s z 1 y z 2 z 1
