order is stationarily layered if the collection of regular suborders of p of cardinality less than is stationary in p p we show that weak compactness can be characterized by this property of partial orders by proving that an uncount able regular cardinal is weakly compact if and only if every partial order satisfying the chain condition is stationarily layered we prove a similar result for strongly inaccessible cardinals moreover we show that the state ment that all knaster partial orders are stationarily layered implies that is a mahlo cardinal and every stationary subset of reflects this shows that this statement characterizes weak compactness in canonical inner models in contrast we show that it is also consistent that this statement holds at a non weakly compact cardinal 1 introduction since the results presented in this paper are motivated by classical questions on the productivity of chain conditions in partial orders we start with a short intro duction to this topic longer introduction can be found in 15 and 16 given an uncountable regular cardinal we let c denote the statement that the product of two partial orders satisfying the chain condition again satisfies the chain con dition then c implies the non existence of souslin trees and ma 1 implies c 1 in particular the statement c 1 is independent from the axioms of zfc a folklore argument shows that c holds if is weakly compact a small modification of this argument yields the statement of the following proposition recall that given an uncountable regular cardinal a partial order is knaster if every sized collec tion of conditions can be refined to a sized set of pairwise compatible conditions given an infinite cardinal and a sequence p the corresponding support product consists of all elements p of the full product of these partial orders such that the set supp p p 6 1 p has cardinality at most proposition 1 1 if is a weakly compact cardinal and then support products of partial orders satisfying the chain condition are knaster 2010 mathematics subject classification 03 e 05 03 e 55 06 a 07 key words and phrases weakly compact cardinals layered posets productivity of chain con ditions knaster

reading of the manuscript 1 http arxiv org abs 1508 03831 v 3 2 sean cox and philipp lu cke proof fix a sequence p of partial orders satisfying the chain condition and a sequence p of conditions in the corresponding support product p p with the help of the system lemma we can find d and a function r such that the set supp p d is a system with root ran r given d with there is a minimal c with the property that either c and the conditions p r c and p r c are incompatible in pr c or c and the conditions p and p are compatible in p by the weak compactness of there is h d that is homogeneous for the resulting colouring c d 2 1 since each p satisfies the chain condition we can conclude that c is constant on h 2 with value and this shows that the resulting sequence p h consists of pairwise compatible conditions in p the knaster property clearly implies the chain condition this property is typically used because of its nice product behavior the product of two knaster partial orders is knaster and the product of a knaster partial order with a partial order satisfying the chain condition satisfies the chain condition for reasons described next we are interested in finding alternative proofs of the above proposition a series of deep results shows that for regular cardinals 1 many con sequences of weak compactness can be derived from the assumption c in 19 shelah showed that c fails if is the successor of a singular cardinal rinot showed in 17 that c implies that every stationary subset of reflects in particular this result can be used to reprove a series of results of shelah showing that c fails for all successors of uncountable regular cardinals in addition rinot showed in 16 that for 1 the principle c implies a failure of and therefore it implies that is weakly compact in go del s constructible universe l these results suggest an affirmative answer to the following question of todorc evic question 1 2 todorc evic 22 question 8 4 27 are the following statements equivalent for every regular cardinal 1 i is weakly compact ii c holds in this paper we want to consider properties of partial orders that imply the chain condition are preserved by forming products and are equivalent to the chain condition if is a weakly compact cardinal note that such properties provide alternative proofs of proposition 1 1 it is interesting to consider the question whether the chain condition can be equivalent to such a property at non weakly compact cardinals because both possible answers yield interesting statements a positive answer to this question would answer todorc evic s question in the negative while a negative answer leads to new characterizations of weak compactness using chain conditions we will now introduce the properties of partial orders studied in this paper remember that given a partial order p we say that q p is a regular suborder if the inclusion map preserves incompatibility and maximal antichains in q are maximal in p definition 1 3 given a cardinal and a partial order p we let reg p denote the collection of all regular suborders of p of cardinality less than large cardinals and layering 3 in the following we will focus on properties of partial orders that imply that reg p is large in a certain sense the following definition presents our main example of such a notion it uses jech s definition of stationarity in p a to express largeness see section 2 definition 1 4 2 definition 19 given an uncountable regular cardinal a partial order p is called stationarily layered if reg p is stationary in p p the notion of layering has appeared most frequently in the literature on satu rated ideals foreman magidor and shelah used layered ideals in 4 to construct nonregular ultrafilters shelah also used the notion of a layered ideal in 18 to ad dress a variant of the katetov question asking about the existence of a topological space of size 1 that contains no isolated points and has the property that any real function has a point of continuity the first author used the notion of layering in 2 to prove a general iteration theorem about so called universal kunen collapses the following lemma is proved in 2 for sake of completeness we will present its short proof in section 2 lemma 1 5 2 lemma 4 if is an uncountable regular cardinal and p is a stationarily layered partial order then p is knaster in particular if every partial order that satisfies the chain condition is stationarily layered then this lemma shows that c holds in the spirit of the approach outlined above we are interested in classes of stationarily layered partial orders that are closed under products the following definition yields examples of such classes these classes will have the property that any two members are layered on a common stationary set in a sense made precise later and this common layering can be used to show that certain classes of this form are also closed under products with larger supports definition 1 6 let be an uncountable regular cardinal be a cardinal and f be a filter on p i a partial order p is f layered if it has cardinality at most and a p s a reg p f holds for every surjection s p ii a partial order p is completely f layered if every subset of p of cardinality at most is contained in a regular suborder of p of cardinality at most and every regular suborder of p of size at most is f layered in section 3 we will show that if f is a normal filter on p then every completely f layered partial order is stationarily layered and the class of partial orders with this property is closed under finite support products moreover for many interesting filters f the class of completely f layered partial orders is also closed under products with larger supports finally if is weakly compact and fwc is the weakly compact filter on p see example 3 1 3 then the class of completely fwc layered partial orders will be shown to closed under support products for every and the following theorem proven in section 4 shows that this class is equal to the class of all partial orders satisfying the chain condition theorem 1 7 given a weakly compact cardinal the following statements are equivalent for every partial order p 4 sean cox and philipp lu cke i p satisfies the chain condition ii p is knaster iii p is stationarily layered iv p is completely fwc layered the results mentioned above show that complete fwc layeredness satisfies the demands listed above and it is interesting to ask whether the existence of a normal uniform filter f on p with the property that the chain condition is equivalent to complete f layeredness implies the weak compactness of it turns out that the weak compactness of already follows from the weaker assumption that the chain condition is equivalent to stationary layeredness this leads to the following new characterization of weakly compact cardinals proven in section 5 theorem 1 8 the following statements are equivalent for every uncountable reg ular cardinal i is weakly compact ii every partial order of cardinality at most satisfying the chain condition is stationarily layered iii every partial order satisfying the chain condition is stationarily lay ered the proof of the above theorem also provides a new characterization of inacces sibility in terms of stationary layeredness this characterization makes use of the following strengthening of the knaster property definition 1 9 given an uncountable cardinal a partial order p is linked if there is and a function c p that is injective on antichains in p theorem 1 10 the following statements are equivalent for every uncountable regular cardinal i is strongly inaccessible ii every linked partial order of cardinality at most is stationarily layered iii every linked partial order is stationarily layered in light of the above results it is natural to ask if there is a large cardinal property that corresponds to the statement that every knaster partial order is stationarily layered the following results show that the question whether this equality characterizes weak compactness is independent from the axioms of set the ory we start by presenting results showing that this assumption yields large car dinal properties intermediate between inaccessibility and weak compactness the proof of the first part of the following result makes use of theorem 1 10 and a theorem of todorc evic from 21 that characterizes mahlo cardinals through the ex istence of special aronszajn trees see section 6 the second part of the theorem is proved using todorc evic s method of walks on ordinals the second conclusion shows that the above assumption has consistency strength greater than the exis tence of a mahlo cardinal remember that given an uncountable regular cardinal a stationary subset s of reflects if there is an lim with the property that s is stationary in theorem 1 11 if is an uncountable regular cardinal with the property that every knaster partial order of cardinality at most is stationarily layered then the following statements hold large cardinals and layering 5 i is a mahlo cardinal ii every stationary subset of reflects seminal results of jensen see 6 section 6 show that the above reflection property characterizes weak compactness in go del s constructible universe l these result were extended by zeman in 23 to a much larger class of canonical inner models together with 23 corollary 0 2 the above theorems yields the following result corollary 1 12 let l e be a jensen style extender model in l e the following statements are equivalent for every uncountable regular cardinal i is weakly compact ii every knaster partial order of cardinality at most is stationarily layered in contrast we will show that consistently there can be a non weakly compact cardinal with the property that every knaster partial order is stationarily lay ered the proof of the following theorem shows that such cardinals exist in a model constructed by kunen in 8 theorem 1 13 if is a weakly compact cardinal then there is a partial order p such that the following statements hold in v g whenever g is p generic over v i is inaccessible and not weakly compact ii every knaster partial order is stationarily layered iii for every the class of knaster partial orders is closed under support products we outline the structure of this paper section 2 includes the relevant back ground material in section 3 we show that classes of completely f layered partial orders satisfy the requirements listed above section 4 contains the proof of theo rem 1 7 and an analogous result for supercompact cardinals the characterizations of inaccessible and weakly compact cardinals stated above are proven in section 5 moreover we will prove theorem 1 13 in this section section 6 contains the proof of theorem 1 11 in section 7 we conclude the paper with some questions raised by the above results 2 preliminaries we start by recalling definitions and previous results relevant for the proofs of the above theorems a map e p q between partial orders is called a regular embedding if e is order and incompatibility preserving and whenever a is a maximal antichain in p then e a is a maximal antichain in q the following well known observation pro vides an alternative characterization of regular embeddings that is used throughout this paper its short proof can be found for example in 2 section 2 proposition 2 1 the following statements are equivalent for order and incom patibility preserving map e p q between partial orders i e is a regular embedding ii for every q q there is p p such that for all p p p the conditions e p and q are compatible in q 6 sean cox and philipp lu cke in the above situation the possibly non unique condition p is called an e reduct of q into p given partial orders p q we say that p is a suborder of q if the inclusion map idp is incompatibility preserving and we say that p is a regular suborder of q if idp is a regular embedding in the later case we just say reduct instead of idp reduct the variations of the following basic observation will be used throughout this paper proposition 2 2 let be an uncountable regular cardinal and let be a cardinal with if q is a partial order that satisfies the chain condition p is a subset of q of cardinality at most and c is a club in p q then there is a regular suborder p of q of cardinality at most such that p p and c p p is club in p p proof by our assumptions there is an increasing continuous sequence p of suborders of q of cardinality at most such that the following statements hold for all i p p ii if a is a maximal antichain in p then there is a maximal antichain a in q with a a p 1 iii if a p p then there is c c with a c p 1 let a be a maximal antichain in p since p is a suborder of q we know that a is an antichain in q and a then there is with a p since a is a maximal antichain in p there is a maximal antichain a in q with a a p 1 p then a is an antichain in p and we can conclude that a a is also a maximal antichain in q this shows that p is a regular suborder of q finally our construction and the regularity of ensure that c p p is unbounded in p p this yields the statement of the proposition because c p p is obviously closed in p p in this paper we use jech s notion of stationarity in p a a subset s of p a is stationary in p a if it meets every subset of p a which is continuous and cofinal in p a we use this notion of stationarity rather than the generalized version of shelah because the stronger notion seems to be needed to prove lemma 1 5 and lemma 5 4 if 1 then both notions of stationarity are equivalent but for 1 certain instances of chang s conjecture may cause them to differ see 3 the next lemma provides useful characterizations of stationary layeredness in many arguments we will just need the assumption that there is some regular car dinal and some elementary submodel m of h with the above properties to derive certain consequence of stationary layeredness the following lemma shows that this assumption is equivalent to stationary layeredness lemma 2 3 the following statements are equivalent for every uncountable regular cardinal and every partial order p i p is stationarily layered ii for every regular cardinal with p h the collection of all elementary substructures m of h with m m and p m reg p is stationary in p h large cardinals and layering 7 iii there is a regular cardinal with p p h and an elementary sub structure m of h with m p m m m and p m reg p proof the equivalence between i and ii follows from standard arguments on lifting and projecting stationary sets see 13 section 1 and the fact that the collection of all elementary submodels m of h with m and m forms a club in p h now assume that reg p is not stationary in p p by the results of 13 section 1 there is a function f p p p p such that a reg p holds for every a p p with f p a p a let andm be as above then f h by elementarity the model m contains a function fm p p p p with the above properties given e p p m we have e m fm e m and therefore fm e p m by the properties of fm this implies that p m reg p using lemma 2 3 it is possible to give a short prove of lemma 1 5 the following proof differs somewhat from the proof presented in 2 proof of lemma 1 5 let p p be an injective enumeration of conditions in p and let be a regular cardinal with p h by lemma 2 3 there is a stationary subset s of p h consisting of elementary substructures m of h with p m m and p m reg p given m s there is a reduct r m of p m into p m this defines a regressive function r s h and we can find q p and s s stationary in p h such that r m q m for all m s pick m n s with m n then the conditions p m and q are compatible in p and since p m q n there is q p n extending p m and q then the conditions p n and q are compatible in p and hence the conditions p m and p n are compatible in p this shows that the sequence p m m s consists of many pairwise compatible conditions 3 f layered partial orders throughout this section denotes an uncountable regular cardinal denotes a cardinal greater than or equal to and f denotes a normal filter on p given a cardinal and a function we define cl a p a a in the following we derive basic structural properties of classes of f layered par tial orders these results show that for many choices of f the class of completely f layered partial orders satisfies the properties listed in section 1 we start by presenting the main examples of such filters examples 3 1 1 we let d denote the club filter on p then d is normal and therefore closed and it contains all sets of the form cl with n for some n 2 let be an infinite cardinal with and for all we define the club filter d on p to be the collection of all subsets of p that contain a subset of the form cl with fix a bijection then cl cl 1 cl holds for every since sets of the form cl 1 are club in p this shows that d is equal to the filter induced by the restriction of d to the stationary set cl and therefore d is a normal filter on p 8 sean cox and philipp lu cke 3 assume that is weakly compact by the results of 9 there is a normal filter on that is generated by sets of the form r a a v a v a where is a 11 formula a v a v and v a a the weakly compact filter fwc on p is the filter generated by sets of the above form viewed as elements of p this filter is again normal and contains the collection of all inaccessible cardinals less than as an element finally for every function with we can find a a as above such that for every r a a this shows that fwc extend the club filter on p for every 4 assume that is supercompact then there is a normal fine ultrafilter u on p let ju v n be the corresponding ultrapower embedding then u s p ju ju s we show that u extends the club filter on p for every fix with if f ju then there is f 0 with f ju f 0 and this implies that ju f ju ju f 0 ju f 0 ju we can conclude that ju ju cl and this shows that cl u the proof of theorem 1 13 in section 4 contains another example of a normal filter on p with the property that the resulting class of completely layered partial orders satisfies the requirements listed in section 1 in the following we prove the statements about f layered partial orders mentioned in section 1 proposition 3 2 the following statements are equivalent for every partial order of cardinality at most i p is f layered ii there is a surjection s p with a p s a reg p f proof given two surjections s 0 s 1 p the set a p s 0 a s 1 a is an element of d and since f is normal it is contained in f lemma 3 3 every f layered partial order is stationarily layered proof let s p be a surjection and be a sufficiently large regular cardinal since the normality of f implies that every element of f is stationary in p we can use a standard lifting argument to show that the collection s of all elementary submodels m of h in p h such that s m m and s m reg p is stationary in p elementarity implies that p m s m holds for all m s and by lemma 2 3 we can conclude that p is stationarily layered lemma 3 4 let be a cardinal such that for every and cl f for every function then the class of f layered partial orders is closed under products of length proof let p be a sequence of f layered partial orders and let s be a surjection of onto the corresponding support product p p fix a sequence d of injections such that supp s ran d for every given let s p denote the induced surjection defined by s s for all in this situation our assumptions ensures that the set f a p s a reg p is an element of f for every large cardinals and layering 9 pick with d for all and in addition pick such that for every map f and every injection g we have supp s f g ran g and s f g g sg f for all let c denote the club in p consisting of all a p with a and define f c cl cl f f pick a f and 0 1 a such that the corresponding conditions q 0 s 0 and q 1 s 1 are compatible in p since a and a a we have supp qi a for all i 2 and there is an injection g a with supp q 0 supp q 1 ran g given we have g a fg and hence sg a reg pg this shows that there is a function f a such that sg f pg qi g for all and i 2 set q s f g s a p by the above choices q is a common extension of q 0 and q 1 in s a this shows that s a is a suborder of p next pick a f and a condition p in p then there is an injection g a with a supp p ran g as above we have g a fg and sg a reg pg for every this shows that there is a function f a such that sg f is a reduct of p g into sg a for every define q s f g s a p and let r be a condition in s a below q as above a and a a imply that supp r a given we have r g pg q g s f g g sg f and this implies that r g is compatible with p g in pg since we ensured that supp p supp r ran g we can conclude that r is compatible with p in p the above computations show that s a is a regular suborder of p for every a f since f f this yields the statement of the lemma corollary 3 5 i the class of f layered partial orders is closed under finite support products of length ii let be an infinite cardinal with and for all if f extends the club filter on p then the class of f layered partial orders is closed under support products of length iii if is a weakly compact cardinal then the class of fwc layered partial orders is closed under products of length for every iv if u is a normal fine ultrafilter on p and then the class of u layered partial orders is closed under support products of length for every in the second part of this section we prove the analogs of the above results for completely f layered partial orders we start by showing that the two concepts coincide on the class of partial orders of size at most lemma 3 6 every f layered partial order is completely f layered proof let q be an f layered partial order and p be a regular suborder of q fix a surjection s q and a function f with the property that s f is a reduct of s into p for all and f for all with s p define s s f p and fix a function g with the property that s g 0 1 p s 0 s 1 for all 0 1 s with s 0 and s 1 compatible in p by our assumptions there is an f f such that s a reg q f a a and g a a a for all a f then the closure of a under g implies that s a 10 sean cox and philipp lu cke is a suborder of p let p be a condition in p then there is a such that s is a reduct of p q into s a pick a with s p s s f since s is a reduct of s into p this shows that the conditions s and s s f are compatible in q then there is q s a with q q s s because s a reg q by the choice of this implies that the conditions p and q are compatible in q since p is a regular suborder of q we can conclude that the conditions p and s are compatible in both q and p this shows that s is a reduct of p into s a hence s a is a regular suborder of p by proposition 3 2 and our assumptions the above computations show that every regular suborder of q is f layered and this means that q is completely f layered lemma 3 7 if holds then every completely f layered partial order is stationarily layered proof let q be a completely f layered partial order and c be a club in p q by our assumptions we can use proposition 2 2 to construct a regular suborder p of q of cardinality at most with the property that c p p is a club in p p an easy computation shows that reg p reg q by definition p is f layered and lemma 3 3 shows that p is stationarily layered this allows us to conclude that 6 c reg p c reg q these computations show that reg q is stationary in p q lemma 3 8 let be a cardinal such that for every and cl f for every function if holds then the class of f layered partial orders is closed under support products proof let q be a sequence of completely f layered partial orders and let q q denote the corresponding support product let p be a subset of q of cardinality at most by our assumptions there is s and a sequence p such that p is a regular suborder of q of cardinality at most for every s p is the trivial suborder of q for every s and p is contained in the corresponding support product p p then p is a regular suborder of q and p has cardinality at most next let p be a regular suborder of q of cardinality at most by the above computations there is s and a sequence p such that p is a regular suborder of q of cardinality at most for every s p is the trivial suborder of q for every s and p is contained in the corresponding support product p p then p is a regular suborder of p since p is f layered for every s our assumptions and lemma 3 4 show that p is f layered by lemma 3 7 p is completely f layered and we can conclude that p is f layered corollary 3 9 i the class of completely f layered partial orders is closed under finite support products ii let be an infinite cardinal with and for all if f extends the club filter on p and holds then the class of completely f layered partial orders is closed under support products iii if is a weakly compact cardinal then the class of completely fwc layered partial orders is closed under support products for every large cardinals and layering 11 iv if u is a normal fine ultrafilter on p and holds then the class of completely u layered partial orders is closed under support products for every 4 layering at large cardinals in this section we show that if a filter f on p is induced by certain large cardinal properties of then the class of all partial orders of cardinality at most that satisfy the chain condition is equal to the class of f layered partial orders lemma 4 1 if is weakly compact then every partial order of cardinality at most that satisfies the chain condition is fwc layered proof let p be a partial order of cardinality at most satisfying the chain condition and let s p be a surjection since is inaccessible there is a club c in such that the following statements hold for all c with i s is a suborder of p ii if a is an antichain in s then there is a maximal antichain a in p with a a s by coding the s preimage of the ordering of p and the incompatibility relation of p into a subset of we find a a as in example 3 1 3 such that the corresponding set r a a consists of inaccessible cardinals lim c with the property that the partial order s satisfies the chain condition pick r a a and let a be a maximal antichain in s then we can find c with a s because s satisfies the chain condition by the definition of c there is a maximal antichain a in p with a a s since s is a suborder of p we can conclude that a is an antichain in s and a a is a maximal antichain in p hence s is a regular suborder of p these computations show that p is fwc layered proof of theorem 1 7 let be a weakly compact cardinal by lemma 1 5 and lemma 3 7 every completely fwc layered partial order is stationarily layered and knaster let p be a partial order satisfying the chain condition then proposition 2 2 implies that every subset of p of cardinality at most is contained in a regular suborder of p of cardinality at most and lemma 4 1 shows that every regular suborder of p of cardinality at most is fwc layered this shows that p is completely fwc layered a combination of theorem 1 7 with corollary 3 9 yields the following statement that provides an alternative proof of proposition 1 1 corollary 4 2 if is a weakly compact and then support products of partial orders satisfying the chain condition are stationarily layered in the following we prove the analogs of the above results for supercompact cardinals the following lemma is a consequence of 2 lemma 30 we present a short direct proof for the reader s convenience lemma 4 3 if is a supercompact cardinal and u is a normal fine ultrafilter on p then every partial order of cardinality at most that satisfies the chain condition is u layered 12 sean cox and philipp lu cke proof let ju v n be the ultrapower embedding corresponding to u fix a partial order p of cardinality at most satisfying the chain condition and a surjection s p by elementarity ju p is a suborder of ju p and the map ju p p ju p is an isomorphism of partial orders let a be a maximal antichain in ju p then a 0 j 1 u a is a maximal antichain in p and since p satisfies the chain condition we have a by elementarity this implies that a ju a 0 ju a 0 is a maximal antichain in ju p this argument shows that ju p is a regular suborder of ju p in n since ju s ju ju s ju p regju ju p n ju reg p we can conclude that a p s a reg p u theorem 4 4 if is a supercompact cardinal u is a normal fine ultrafilter on p and holds then the following statements are equivalent for every partial order p i p satisfies the chain condition ii p is knaster iii p is stationarily layered iv p is completely u layered proof by lemma 1 5 and lemma 3 7 every completely u layered partial order is stationarily layered and knaster let p be a partial order satisfying the chain condition then proposition 2 2 implies that every subset of p of cardinality at most is contained in a regular suborder of p of cardinality at most and lemma 4 3 shows that every regular suborder of p of cardinality at most is u layered this shows that p is completely u layered in the remainder of this section we prove theorem 1 13 this proof uses a construction of kunen presented in 8 section 3 showing that it is possible to use forcing to first destroy the weak compactness of a cardinal and then resurrect it by a further forcing in order to describe this construction we recall some basic definitions about set theoretic trees remember that a partial order t is a tree if it has a unique minimal element and for every t t the set predt t s t s t t is well ordered by t in this situation we set lht t otp predt t t t t t lht t and t t t lht t for every ordinal we let ht t lubt tlht t denote the height of a tree t and we set t a a t for every a ht t a subset b of a tree t is a cofinal branch through t if b is downwards closed with respect to t and b is well ordered by t with order type ht t given an uncountable regular cardinal a tree t is a aronszajn tree if ht t t has no cofinal branches and t for all finally we say that a tree t of uncountable regular height is a souslin tree if the corresponding partial order pt t t satisfies the chain condition kunen s construction starts with a preparatory forcing that causes the weak compactness of a cardinal to be indestructible with respect to forcing with the par tial order add 1 that adds a cohen subset to then an add 1 generic extension is split into a two step iteration that first adds a souslin tree t and then adds a cofinal branch through this tree using the partial order pt in the inter mediate model is inaccessible and non weakly compact whereas the preparatory large cardinals and layering 13 forcing ensures that is again weakly compact in the final extension moreover this construction ensures that the partial order pt is distributive in v g proof of theorem 1 13 let be a weakly compact cardinal by the results of 8 section 3 mentioned above there is a partial order p and a filter g on p that is generic over v such that is inaccessible in v g and there is a souslin tree t in v g with the property that the corresponding partial order pt is distributive in v g and is weakly compact in every pt generic extension of v g let f denote the set of all subsets a of p in v g such that 1 pt a fwc holds in v g then f is a normal filter on p in v g pick a knaster partial order q of cardinality and a surjection s q in v g then pt q satisfies the chain condition in v g define f a p v g s a reg q v g p v g let h be pt generic over v g in v g h is a weakly compact cardinal and q satisfies the chain condition since the partial order pt is distributive in v g we know that p v g p v g h p q v g p q v g h and reg q v g reg q v g h in this situation lemma 4 1 implies that q is f v g h wc layered in v g h and we can conclude that f a p v g h s a reg q v g h f v g h wc this argument shows that f f and q is f layered in v g now work in v g and pick a knaster partial order q by proposition 2 2 every subset of q of cardinality at most is contained in a regular suborder of q of cardinality since every regular suborder of q is also knaster the above computations show that every regular suborder of q of cardinality is f layered these computations show that every knaster partial order is completely f layered in v g by lemma 3 7 this implies that every knaster partial order is stationarily layered in v g finally given a cardinal a function in v g and a filter h that is pt generic over v g we can use the computations made in example 3 1 3 and the fact that the partial order pt is distributive in v g to conclude that cl v g cl v g h f v g h wc holds this shows that we have cl v g f for every cardinal and every function in v g in this situation lemma 3 8 implies that for every the class of completely f layered partial orders is closed under support products in v g by combining lemma 1 5 lemma 3 7 and the above computations we know that the class of knaster partial orders coincides with the class of completely f layered partial orders in v g this yields the last statement of the theorem remark 4 5 proposition 1 1 shows that the last statement listed in theorem 1 13 holds when is weakly compact and the theorem shows that consistently this state ment holds at an inaccessible cardinal that is not weakly compact in contrast 10 theorem 1 13 shows that this statement characterizes weak compactness in canonical inner models 14 sean cox and philipp lu cke 5 characterizations of large cardinals this section contains the proofs of the theorems that characterize inaccessible and weakly compact cardinals in terms of layered partial orders we start with the characterization of inaccessible cardinals proof of theorem 1 10 let be an inaccessible cardinal and let p be a linked partial order fix a function c p that is injective on antichains in p and a regular cardinal with p h let s denote the collection of all elementary submodels m of h such that m and p p c m then s is stationary in p h fix m s and a condition p in p set a c r r p p then a m and elementarity implies that there is a condition q in p m with a c r r p q let r be an extension of q in p m then there is an extension s of p in p with c r c s this shows that every extension of q in p m is compatible with p in p we can conclude that q is a reduct of p into p m this shows that p m is a regular suborder of p in the other direction assume toward a contradiction that is regular but not strongly inaccessible and every linked partial order is stationarily layered let be minimal with 2 since is regular we have 2 fix a subset x of 2 of cardinality and define a partial order p by the following clauses a conditions in p are pairs p sp ap with sp np 2 for some np and ap x b given conditions p and q in p we have p p q if and only if sq sp aq ap and sp i x for all x aq and nq i np since conditions in p with the same first component are compatible the partial order p is linked and has cardinality let be a regular cardinal with p h by lemma 2 3 there is an elementary submodelm of h of cardinality less than such that p m 2 m and p m is a regular suborder of p pick x x m and define p x then p is a condition in p and there is reduct q of p into p m since x m and aq is a finite subset ofm we have x aq and there is an with x 6 y for every y aq define r sq nq x aq notice that x is an element of m because 2 m then r is an extension of q in p m and our assumptions imply that r is compatible with p in p a contradiction remark 5 1 essentially the same proof shows that the partial order p defined in the previous proof is not strongly proper with respect to any stationary subset of p h here strongly proper is in the sense of mitchell see 14 to characterize weakly compact cardinals we make use of the following well known forcing notion that turns a tree of uncountable regular height without cofinal branches into a special tree of height 1 definition 5 2 given an uncountable regular cardinal and a tree t of height we let p t denote the partial order whose conditions are finite partial functions s t finite that are injective on chains in t and whose ordering is given by reversed inclusion the proof of the following lemma is a small variation of baumgartner s elegant proof of 1 theorem 8 2 a detailed presentation of this argument can be found in 10 large cardinals and layering 15 lemma 5 3 if is an uncountable regular cardinal and t is a tree of height without cofinal branches then the partial order p t satisfies the chain condition the next lemma is the last ingredient missing in order to complete the proof of theorem 1 8 lemma 5 4 if is an uncountable regular cardinal and t is a aronszajn tree then the partial order p t is not stationarily layered proof assume toward a contradiction that p t is stationarily layered by lemma 2 3 there is an elementary submodel m of h such that m m p m and p t m reg p t pick t t m and set p t 0 then p is a condition in p t and there is a reduct q of p into p t m since the conditions p and q are compatible in p t we have q s 6 0 for all s dom q with s t t let be minimal with dom q t then m and elementarity implies that t m because t is a aronszajn tree let u denote the unique element of t with u t t set r q u 0 by the above remarks r is a condition in p t m below q this implies that the conditions p and r are compatible in p t a contradiction remark 5 5 essentially the same proof shows that the specializing partial order p t is not strongly proper with respect to any stationary subset of p h proof of theorem 1 8 by theorem 1 7 if is a weakly compact cardinal then every partial order satisfying the chain condition is stationarily layered in the converse direction let be an uncountable regular cardinal with the property that every partial order of cardinality at most satisfying the chain condition is stationarily layered since linked partial orders satisfy the chain condition theorem 1 10 implies that is inaccessible in this situation a combination of lemma 5 3 and lemma 5 4 implies that there are no aronszajn trees by a classical result of erdo s and tarski we can conclude that is weakly compact 6 characterizations via the knaster property in this section we prove theorem 1 11 the proof of this result makes use of the following notions defined by todorc evic in 20 section 4 and 21 section 1 definition 6 1 todorc evic let be an uncountable regular cardinal let s and let t be a tree of height i a map r t s t is regressive if r t t t holds for t t s that is not minimal in t ii we say that s is nonstationary with respect to t if there is a regressive map r t s t with the property that for every t t there is a function ct r 1 t t such that t and ct is injective on t chains iii the tree t is special if is nonstationary with respect to t by 20 theorem 14 this notion of special trees generalizes the classical notion of special trees trees of height that are a union of many antichains to a concept that also makes sense for limit cardinals todorc evic used this concept in 21 theorem 1 9 to provide a new characterization of mahlo cardinals his result shows that an inaccessible cardinal is a mahlo cardinal if and only if there are no special aronszajn trees 16 sean cox and philipp lu cke proposition 6 2 let be an uncountable regular cardinal and let t be a tree of height if there is a stationary subset s of that is nonstationary with respect to t then t has no cofinal branches proof let r t s t and ct r 1 t t t t witness that s is non stationary with respect to t assume toward a contradiction that there is a cofinal branch b through t given s let t denote the unique element of b t by fodor s lemma there is e s stationary in s t and s such that r t s and cs t for all e this is a contradiction because cs is injective on t e we now want to isolate properties of trees t that imply that the partial order p t defined in definition 5 2 is knaster definition 6 3 we say that a tree t of height does not split at limit levels if for all lim and all t 0 t 1 t with t 0 6 t 1 we can find and s 0 s 1 t with s 0 6 s 1 and si t ti for all i 2 the next lemma is a special case of results contained in 10 that study the properties of forcings that specialize higher aronszajn trees lemma 6 4 let be an uncountable regular cardinal and let t be a aronszajn tree that does not split at limit levels if there is a stationary subset of that is nonstationary with respect to t then the partial order p t is knaster proof fix an injective sequence p of conditions in p t and functions r t s t and ct r 1 t t t t witnessing that a stationary subset s of is nonstationary with respect to t pick s lim then we can find n and a bijective enumeration t k k n of all t t with t t u for some u dom p since t does not split at limit levels we can find and an injection n t such that k t t k for all k n since lim there is such that dom p t t and k r t k t for all k n since s lim is stationary in fodor s lemma yields s 0 s lim stationary in n and min s 0 with n n and for all s 0 we have t because t is a aronszajn tree another application of fodor s lemma yields s 1 s 0 stationary in r t a map d r an injection n t and a map r n t such that r dom p t d p r k k and r k r t k for all s 1 and k n since r k for all k n a final application of fodor s lemma yields s 2 s 1 stationary in and a map c n such that c k cr k t k for all s 2 and k n pick u s 2 unbounded in such that dom p 0 t 1 holds for all 0 1 u with 0 1 assume toward a contradiction that there are 0 1 u such that 0 1 and the conditions p 0 and p 1 are incompatible in p t since the above choices ensure that dom p 0 dom p 1 r and p 0 r p 1 r hold we can find u 0 dom p 0 t 0 and u 1 dom p 1 t 1 with the property that u 0 t u 1 and p 0 u 0 p 1 u 1 given i 2 there is ki n with t i ki t ui since k 0 t t 0 k 0 t u 0 t u 1 k 1 t t 1 k 1 t u 1 and ran t for some the injectivity of implies that k 0 k 1 this shows that the nodes t 0 k 0 and t 1 k 1 are incompatible in t because we have r t 0 k 0 r k 0 r k 1 r t 1 k 1 and cr k 0 t 0 k 0 c k 0 c k 1 cr k 1 t 1 k 1 cr k 0 t 1 k 1 large cardinals and layering 17 but this yields a contradiction because t 0 k 0 t u 0 t u 1 and t 1 k 1 t u 1 the above argument shows that the sequence p u consists of pairwise compatible conditions in p t in order to prove theorem 1 11 we introduce more notions defined by todorc evic in 21 section 1 these concepts will allow us to combine the above results with the proof of 21 theorem 1 9 to derive the statement of the theorem definition 6 5 todorc evic let be an uncountable regular cardinal i a sequence c c is a c sequence of length if the following statements hold for all a if is a limit ordinal then c is a closed unbounded subset of b if 1 then c ii let c c be a c sequence a given the walk from to through c is the unique sequence 0 n with 0 n and i 1 min c i for all i n in this situation we define the full code of the walk from to through c to be the sequence c 0 otp c 0 otp c n 1 b given we define c 0 1 7 c 0 c we define t c 0 to be the tree of height consisting of all functions of the form c 0 with ordered by inclusion note that trees of the form t c 0 for some c sequence c do not split at limit levels because we have lh t c 0 c 0 for all proof of part i of theorem 1 11 let be an uncountable regular cardinal with the property that every knaster partial order is stationarily layered since linked partial orders are knaster theorem 1 10 implies that is inaccessible assume towards a contradiction that is not mahlo then the proof of 21 theorem 1 9 shows that there is a c sequence c of length such that t c 0 is a special aronszajn tree by the above remarks this implies that there is a special aronszajn tree t that does not split at limit levels then lemma 6 4 shows that the partial order p t is knaster and hence our assumption implies that p t is stationarily layered but this conclusion contradicts lemma 5 4 in the remainder of this section we prove the second part of theorem 1 11 we want to construct aronszajn trees t with the property that the corresponding partial order p t defined in definition 5 2 is knaster for every inaccessible car dinal that admits a non reflecting stationary subset the following concept will provide us with a method to construct such trees that can also be applied in the case where is a mahlo cardinal 18 sean cox and philipp lu cke definition 6 6 22 definition 8 2 3 given an uncountable regular cardinal we say that a c sequence c c avoids s if c s holds for every limit ordinal less than the proof of the following lemma is similar to the proof of 21 theorem 1 9 it relies on several computations made in 21 that deal with the properties of full codes of walks through c sequences these computations are presented in detail in 7 section 3 and we will refer to this presentation in the following proof lemma 6 7 given an uncountable regular cardinal if c is a c sequence that avoids a subset s of then s is nonstationary with respect to t c 0 proof fix a bijection b and let d be the club of all limit ordinals with b let c c be a c sequence that avoids a subset s of and let t denote t c 0 since 20 theorem 13 shows that the collection of subsets of that are nonstationary with respect to t is a normal ideal on it suffices to show that the set d s is nonstationary with respect to t to derive the statement of the lemma pick d s and let 0 n denote the walk from to through c since c avoids s and s is a limit ordinal we can conclude that for all i n the set c i is bounded in and otp c i holds this shows that c 0 and by our assumptions on there is f with b f c 0 now pick a node t in t d s let lht t d s and let be minimal with t c 0 in this situation we define r t c 0 f t t this yields a regressive function r t d s t assume toward a contra diction that there are t 0 t 1 t d s with t 0 t t 1 and r t 0 r t 1 given i 2 let i lht ti and let i i be minimal with ti c 0 i i then 0 1 c 0 0 0 c 0 1 1 and c 0 0 c 0 1 for all 0 first assume that 0 0 then c 0 0 0 c 0 1 1 and we have 1 1 since c avoids s we have max c 1 0 0 and there is c 0 with max c 1 0 0 by our assumptions we have otp c 0 c 0 0 c 0 1 and the sequence 1 is the walk from 1 to through c but this implies that c 1 a contradiction now assume that 0 0 given i 2 let i 0 i ni denote the walk from i to i through c then c 0 0 0 c 0 1 1 implies that n 0 n 1 0 and 1 1 since c avoids s we have sup c i ni 1 0 0 for all i 2 together with our assumptions this allows us to use 7 proposition 3 6 to conclude that c 0 0 0 c 0 0 1 holds moreover since 0 1 1 we can apply 7 lemma 3 4 to see that c 0 0 1 6 c 0 1 1 large cardinals and layering 19 holds together with our assumptions this yields c 0 0 0 c 0 0 1 6 c 0 1 1 c 0 0 0 a contradiction by the above computations the regressive function r t d s t wit nesses that the set d s is nonstationary with respect to t by the above lemma it is possible to construct trees with the desired properties from a c sequences c with the properties that t c 0 is a aronszajn tree and c avoids a stationary subset of the following proof shows that the sequence induced by a non reflecting subset has these properties proof of part ii of theorem 1 11 let be an uncountable regular cardinal with the property that every knaster partial order of cardinality at most is stationarily layered then theorem 1 10 implies that is inaccessible assume toward a contradiction that there is a stationary subset s of that does not reflect then we may assume that s consists of limit ordinals and by picking counterexam ples to reflection at every limit ordinal less than we can construct a c sequence c c that avoids s set t t c 0 then lemma 6 7 shows that there is a stationary subset of that is nonstationary with respect to t by propo sition 6 2 this implies that t has no cofinal branches since is inaccessible we can use 7 proposition 4 2 to conclude that t holds for all this shows that t is a aronszajn tree by the above computations lemma 6 4 implies that the partial order p t is knaster but lemma 5 4 shows that p t is not stationarily layered a contradiction 7 questions and concluding remarks we conclude with questions raised by the results of this paper question 7 1 assume that is an inaccessible cardinal with the property that every knaster partial order is stationarily layered is weakly compact in l theorem 1 11 shows that cardinals with this property are reflection cardinals and by 12 theorem 3 they are reflection cardinals in l moreover corollary 1 12 shows that in l the above assumption is equivalent to weak compactness in contrast theorem 1 13 shows that the assumption does not imply weak compact ness in v the following question mentions the obvious strategy to derive a positive answer to the above question question 7 2 let be an inaccessible cardinal does the existence of a sequence see 21 section 1 imply the existence of a knaster partial order that is not stationarily layered the results of this paper show that inaccessiblity and weak compactness are provably equivalent to statements about the stationary layeredness of certain partial orders it is natural to ask whether other small large cardinal properties can be described in this way question 7 3 are there other natural instances of pairs with is a large cardinal property weaker than weak compactness of and is a class of partial orders satisfying the chain condition 20 sean cox and philipp lu cke so that zfc proves that for every inaccessible cardinal the statement is equivalent to the statement that every partial order in is stationarily layered in particular is there a class of partial orders satisfying the chain condition that corresponds to mahlo cardinals in this way the above questions deal with characterizations of consequences of weak com pactness in the light of theorem 4 4 it is natural to ask whether stronger large cardinal properties can be described by similar results question 7 4 let be an inaccessible cardinal such that there is a normal filter f on p with the property that every partial order of cardinality that satisfies the chain condition is f layered must be a measurable cardinal in the setting of the above question we have and by proposition 2 2 and lemma 3 7 every partial order satisfying the chain condition is com pletely f layered and therefore stationarily layered in particular theorem 1 8 shows that the above assumptions on imply that is weakly compact the characterization of weakly compact and mahlo cardinals through the non existence of certain trees is crucial for the above proofs since stronger large cardinal properties can be described by the non existence of certain p trees see 5 and 11 we may ask whether similar arguments could work for these properties this approach leads to the question whether analogs of the specialization forcing p t exist for p trees question 7 5 given an inaccessible cardinal a cardinal and a normal filter f on p does the existence of a p tree without cofinal branches imply the existence of a partial order of cardinality that satisfies the chain condition and is not f layered c c is productive uu is weakly

figure 1 summary of results and open questions large cardinals and layering 21 figure 1 summarizes some of the main theorems and open questions related to the topics of this paper an arrow in the diagram represents an implication a crossed out arrow represents a non implication and a dashed arrow with a ques tion mark represents an open problem the motivating problem whether pro ductivity of the chain condition implies the weak compactness of appeared in todorc evic 22 the failure of from the productivity of the chain con dition is due to rinot 16 the implication from a failure of to the weak compactness of in l is a consequence of results of jensen 6 and the equivalence of stationary reflection and weak compactness in canonical inner models l e is due to jensen 6 and zeman 23 all other implications and non implications in the diagram are either trivial or are proved in the current paper note that the 3 way equivalence between is weakly compact f c c f layered and c c stat
