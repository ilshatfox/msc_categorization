doing and showing andrei rodin abstract the persisting gap between the formal and the informal mathematics is due to an inadequate notion of mathematical theory behind the current formalization tech niques i mean the informal notion of axiomatic theory according to which a mathemat ical theory consists of a set of axioms and further theorems deduced from these axioms according to certain rules of logical inference thus the usual notion of axiomatic method is inadequate and needs a replacement 1 introduction 1 part 1 euclid s way of building mathematical theories 3 2 demonstration and

theorems which are deduced from the axioms according to certain rules of inference such rules are supposed to be truth preserving in the following sense as far as the axioms are true the theorems derived from these axioms are also true further these rules are supposed to be not specific for any given theory one assumes that the same set of rules of inference applies in all axiomatic theories logical monism or at least that any complete set of such rules applies in some large class of theories logical pluralism these basic features of the rules of inference can be briefly expressed by saying 1 ar x iv 1 10 9 42 98 v 1 m at h h o 3 1 a ug 2 01 1 2 andrei rodin that those rules are the rules of logical inference a logical inference of a given theorem from the axioms possibly through a number of intermediate propositions is called a proof of this theorem here is how this core notion of axiomatic theory is described by hilbert in his famous address axiomatic thought delivered before the swiss mathematical society in zurich in 1917 if we consider a particular theory more closely we always see that a few distinguished propositions of the field of knowledge underlie the construc tion of the framework of concepts and these propositions then suffice by themselves for the construction in accordance with logical principles of the entire framework these fundamental propositions can be regarded as the axioms of the individual fields of knowledge the progressive devel opment of the individual field of knowledge then lies solely in the further logical construction of the already mentioned framework of concepts this standpoint is especially predominant in pure mathematics a nything at all that can be the object of scientific thought becomes dependent on the axiomatic method an thereby indirectly on mathematics 17 in a different paper 18 hilbert goes even further and claims that the axiomatic method is and remains the indispensable tool appropriate to our minds for all exact research in any field whatsoever it is logically incontestable and at the same time fruitful to proceed axiomatically means in this sense nothing else than to think with consciousness the above quotes do not fully describe what hilbert has in mind when he talks about the axiomatic method this general description leaves a wide room for further specifications and interpretations many of which turn to be mutually incompatible discussions over such further details of the axiomatic method of theory building have been playing an important role in the philosophy of mathematics since the beginning of the 20 th century one such continuing discussion concerns the epistemic status of axioms according to the traditional view dating back to aristotle and more recently defended by frege axioms are self evident truths which can and should be used for proving some further propositions theorems which by themselves are not evident according to a novel viewpoint defended by hilbert axioms are formal expressions that given different truth values through their different interpretations i provide some further explanations in section 6 below such different views on axioms lead frege and hilbert to very different notions of axiomatic theory and different understanding of the axiomatic method however important this and other differences in the understanding of the core axiomatic method might be they are not directly relevant to my argument given below in this paper instead of discussing various specifications of the axiomatic method i would like to put here under a critical examination the core notion of axiomatic method itself which is assumed in particular by both hilbert and frege in their influential debate 11 doing and showing 3 the paper is organized as follows first i elaborate in some detail on the first book of euclid s elements and show that euclid s theory of geometry is not axiomatic in the modern sense but is construed differently second i provide some evidences showing that the usual commonly accepted notion of axiomatic theory equally fails to account for today s mathematical theories i also provide some polemical arguments against the popular view according to which a good mathematical theory must be axiomatic in the usual general sense and point to an alternative method of theory building since my critique of the core axiomatic method is constructive in its character i briefly observe known constructive approaches in the foundations of mathematics and describe the place of my proposal in this context the main difference of my and earlier constructive proposals for foundations of mathematics appears to be the following while earlier proposals deal with the issue of admissibility of some particular mathematical principles and like choice and some putative mathematical objects like infinite sets my proposal concerns the very method of theory building as a consequence my proposal unlike earlier constructive proposals puts no restriction on the existing mathematical practice but rather suggests an alternative method of organizing this practice into a systematic theoretical form in the concluding section of the paper i argue that the constructive mathematics in the specific sense of the term specified in an earlier section of this paper better serves needs of mathematically laden empirical sciences than the formalized mathematics part 1 euclid s way of building mathematical theories 2 demonstration and monstration all propositions of euclid s elements 9 with few easily understandable exceptions are designed according to the same scheme described by proclus in his commentary 30 as follows every problem and every theorem that is furnished with all its parts should contain the following elements an enunciation an exposition a specifica tion a construction a proof and a conclusion of these enunciation states what is given and what is being sought from it a perfect enunciation con sists of both these parts the exposition takes separately what is given and prepares it in advance for use in the investigation the specification takes separately the thing that is sought and makes clear precisely what it is the construction adds what is lacking in the given for finding what is sought the proof draws the proposed inference by reasoning scientifically from the propositions that have been admitted the conclusion reverts to the enunciation confirming what has been proved 30 p 203 italic is mine it is appropriate to notice here that the term proposition which is traditionally used in translations as a common name of euclid s problems and theorems is not found in 4 andrei rodin the original text of the elements euclid numerates these things throughout each book without naming them by any common name the reader will shortly see that this detail is relevant the difference between problems and theorems will be explained in the section 4 below let me now show how this proclus scheme applies to proposition 5 of the first book theorem 1 5 which is a well known theorem about angles of the isosceles triangle i quote euclid s elements by the recent english translation by richard fitzpatrick 8 references in square brackets are added by the translator some of them will be discussed later on words in round brackets are added by the translator for stylistic reason words in angle brackets are borrowed from the above proclus quote throughout this paper i write these words in italic when i use them in proclus specific sense enunciation for isosceles triangles the angles at the base are equal to one another and if the equal straight lines are produced then the angles under the base will be equal to one another exposition let abc be an isosceles triangle having the side ab equal to the side ac and let the straight lines bd and ce have been produced further in a straight line with ab and ac respectively post 2 doing and showing 5 specification i say that the angle abc is equal to acb and angle cbd to bce construction for let a point f be taken somewhere on bd and let ag have been cut off from the greater ae equal to the lesser af prop 1 3 also let the straight lines fc gb have been joined post 1 proof 6 andrei rodin in fact since af is equal to ag and ab to ac the two straight lines fa ac are equal to the two straight lines ga ab respectively they also encompass a common angle fag thus the base fc is equal to the base gb and the triangle afc will be equal to the triangle agb and the remaining angles subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining angles prop 1 4 that is acf to abg and afc to agb and since the whole of af is equal to the whole of ag within which ab is equal to ac the remainder bf is thus equal to the remainder cg ax 3 but fc was also shown to be equal to gb so the two straight lines bf fc are equal to the two straight lines cg gb respectively and the angle bfc is equal to the angle cgb while the base bc is common to them thus the triangle bfc will be equal to the triangle cgb and the remaining angles subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining angles prop 1 4 thus fbc is equal to gcb and bcf to cbg therefore since the whole angle abg was shown to be equal to the whole angle acf within which cbg is equal to bcf the remainder abc is thus equal to the remainder acb ax 3 and they are at the base of triangle abc and fbc was also shown to be equal to gcb and they are under the base conclusion thus for isosceles triangles the angles at the base are equal to one another and if the equal sides are produced then the angles under the base will be equal to one another which is the very thing it was required to show an obvious difference between proclus analysis of the above theorem and its usual mod ern analysis is the following for a modern reader the proof of this theorem begins with proclus exposition and includes proclus specification construction and proof thus for proclus the proof is only a part of what we call today the proof of this theorem also notice that euclid s theorems conclude with the words which was required to show as correctly translates fitzpatrick but not with the words what it was required to prove as inaccurately translates heath 14 the standard latin translation of this euclid s for mula as quod erat demonstrandum is also inaccurate these inaccurate translations conflate two different greek verbs apodeiknumi english to prove latin demonstrare and deiknumi english to show latin monstrare the difference between the two verbs can be clearly seen in the two aristotle s analytics aristotle uses the verb apodeiknumi and the derived noun apodeixis proof as technical terms in his syllogistic logic and he uses the verb deiknumi in a broader and more informal sense when he discusses episte mological issues mostly in the second analytics without trying to trace here the history of greek logical and mathematical terminology and speculate about possible influences of some greek writers on some other writers i would like to stress the remarkable fact that aristotle s use of verbs deiknumi and apodeiknumi agrees with euclid s and proclus in my view this fact alone is sufficient for taking seriously the difference between the two doing and showing 7 verbs and distinguish between proof and showing or otherwise between demonstration and monstration 1 one may think that the difference between the current meaning of the word proof in today s mathematics and logic and the meaning of proclus proof greek apodeixis is a merely terminological issue which is due to difficulties of translation from greek to english i shall try now to show that this terminological difference points on a deeper problem which is not merely linguistic in today s logic the word proof stands for a logical inference of certain conclusion from some given premises in fact this is what by and large was meant by proof also by aristotle and proclus indeed looking at the proof in proclus sense of euclids theorem 1 5 we see that it also qualifies as a proof in the modern sense we have here a number of premises which i shall specify in the next section and certain conclusions derived from those premises it is irrelevant now whether or not this particular inference is valid according to today s logical standards what i want to stress here is only the general setting that involves some premises an inference probably invalid and some conclusions this core meaning of the word proof greek apodeixis hardly changed since proclus times so we get a problem which is clearly not only terminological is it indeed justified to describe the exposition the specification and the construction as elements of the proof or one should rather follow proclus and consider these things as independent constituents of a mathematical theorem the question of logical significance of the exposition the specification and the construction in euclid s geometry has been discussed in the literature in what follows i shall briefly describe some tentative answers to it however before doing this i would like to stress that this question may be ill posed to begin with as far as one assumes first that the theory of euclid s elements is by and large sound and second that any sound mathematical theory is an axiomatic theory in the modern sense then in order to make these two assumptions mutually compatible one has to describe the exposition the specification and the construction of each euclid s theorem as parts of the proof of this theorem and specify their logical role and their logical status i shall not challenge the usual assumption according to which euclid s mathematics is by and large sound i say by and large in order to leave some room for possible revisions and corrections of euclid s arguments and thus avoid controversies about the question whether a given interpretation of euclid is authentic or not although i pay more attention to textual details than it is usually done in modern logical reconstructions of euclid s reasoning i am not going to criticize these reconstructions by pointing to their anachronistic character however i shall challenge 1 as far as mutual influences are concerned two things are certain i proclus read aristotle and ii aristotle had at least a basic knowledge of the mathematical tradition on which euclid later elaborated in his elements as aristotle s mathematical examples clearly show 15 it remains unclear whether aristotle s work could influence euclid in my view this is unlikely however aristotle s logic certainly played an important role in later interpretations and revisions of euclid s elements i leave this interesting issue outside of the scope of this paper 8 andrei rodin the other assumption according to which any sound mathematical theory is an axiomatic theory in the modern sense since i do not take this latter assumption for granted i do not assume from the outset that the problematic elements of euclid s reasoning the exposition the specification and the construction play some logical role which only needs to be made explicit and appropriately understood in what follows i try to describe how these elements work without making about them any additional assumptions and only then decide whether the role of these elements qualifies as logical or not 3 are euclid s proofs logical let s look at euclid s theorem 1 5 more attentively i begin its analysis with its proof among the premisses of this proof one may easily identify axiom common notion 3 according to which ax 3 if equal things are subtracted from equal things then the remainders are equal and the preceding theorem 1 4 according to which prop 1 4 if two triangles have two corresponding sides equal and have the angles enclosed by the equal sides equal then they will also have equal bases and the two triangles will be equal and the remaining angles subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining angles i shall not comment on the role theorem 1 4 in this proof which seems to be clear but say few things about the role of the axiom 3 here is how exactly the axiom common notion 3 is used in the above euclid s proof first by construction we have con 1 bf af ab and con 2 cg ag ac which is tantamount to saying that point b lays between points a f and point c lays between points a g second by hypothesis we have hyp ab ac and once again by construction con 3 af ag now we see that we have got the situation described in ax 3 equal things are subtracted from equal things using this axiom we conclude that bf cg notice that ax 3 applies to all things mathematical objects for which the relation of equality and the operation of subtraction make sense in euclid s mathematics this relation and this operation apply not only to straight segments and numbers but also to geometrical objects of various sorts including figures angles and solids since euclid s equality is not interchangeable with identity i use for the two relations two different symbols namely i doing and showing 9 use the usual symbol for euclid s equality even if this equality is not quite usual and use symbol for identity my use of symbols and is self explanatory 2 the other four euclid s axioms not to be confused with postulates have the same character this makes euclid s axioms in general and ax 3 in particular very unlike premises like con 1 3 and hyp so one may wonder whether the very idea of treating these things on equal footing as different premises of the same inference makes sense more precisely we have here the following choice one option is to interpret ax 3 as the following implication a b c d e f b d c f a b and then use it along with con 1 3 and hyp for getting the desired conclusion through modus ponens and other appropriate rules this standard analysis involves a fundamental distinction between premises and conclusion on the one hand and rules of inference on the other hand it assumes that in spite of the fact that euclid as most of other mathematicians of all times remains silent about logic his reasoning nevertheless follows some implicit logical rules the purpose of logical analysis in this case is to make this underlying logic as some philosophers like to call it explicit the other option that i have in mind is to interpret ax 3 itself as a rule rather than as a premiss following this rule which can be pictures as follows a b c d e f b d c f ax 3 a b one derives from con 1 3 and hyp the desired conclusion so interpreted ax 3 hardly qualifies as a logical rule because it applies only to propositions of a particular sort namely of the form x y where x y are some mathematical objects of appropriate types this axiom cannot help one to prove that socrates is mortal nevertheless the domain of application of this rule is quite vast and covers the whole of euclid s mathematics an important advantage of this analysis is that it doesn t require one to make any assumption about hidden features of euclid s thinking unlike the distinction between logical rules and instances of applications of these rules the distinction between axioms and premises like con 1 3 and hyp is explicit in euclid s elements there is also a historical reason to prefer the latter reading of euclid s common notions aristotle uses the word axiom interchangeably with the expressions common notions 2 the difference a b of two figures a b is a figure obtained through cutting b out of a the sum a b is the result of concatenation of a and b these operations are not defined up to congruence of figures for there are generally speaking many possible ways in which one may cut out one figure from another but according to euclid s axioms these operations are defined up to euclid s equality this shows that euclid s equality is weaker than congruence according to axiom 4 congruent objects are equal but generally the converse does not hold in the case of plane figures euclid s equality is equivalent to the equality in the modern sense of their air 10 andrei rodin common opinions or simply commons for what we call today logical laws or logical principles but not for what we call today axioms moreover in this context he systemat ically draws an analogy between mathematical common notions and his proposed logical principles laws of logic this among other things provides an important historical justi fication for calling euclid s common notions by the name of axioms it is obvious that mathematics in general and mathematical common notions axioms in particular serve for aristotle as an important source for developing the very idea of logic roughly speaking aristotle s thinking as i understand it is this behind the basic principles of mathematical reasoning spelled out through mathematical common notions axioms there are other yet more general principles relevant to reasoning about all sorts of beings and not only about mathematical objects the fact that euclid according to the established chronology is younger than aristotle for some 25 years euclid s dates unlike aristotle s are only ap proximate shouldn t confuse one while there is no strong evidence of the influence of aristotle s work on euclid the influence on aristotle of the same mathematical tradition on which euclid elaborated is clearly documented in aristotle s writings themselves in particular aristotle quotes euclid s ax 3 which of course aristotle could know from another source almost verbatim 3 3 here are some quotes by first principles of proof as distinguished from first principles in general i mean the common opinions on which all men base their demonstrations e g that one of two contradictories must be true that it is impossible for the same thing both be and not to be and all other propositions of this kind met 996 b 27 32 heath s translation corrected here aristotle refers to a logical principle as common opinion in the next quote he compares mathe matical and logical axioms we have now to say whether it is up to the same science or to different sciences to inquire into what in mathematics is called axioms and into the general issue of essence clearly the inquiry into these things is up to the same science namely to the science of the philosopher for axioms hold of everything that there is but not of some particular genus apart from others everyone makes use of them because they concern being qua being and each genus is but men use them just so far as is sufficient for their purpose that is within the limits of the genus relevant to their proofs since axioms clearly hold for all things qua being for being is what all things share in common one who studies being qua being also inquires into the axioms this is why one who observes things partly who inquires into a special domain like a geometer or a arithmetician never tries to say whether the axioms are true or false met 1005 a 19 28 my translation here is the last quote where aristotle refers to ax 3 explicitly since the mathematician too uses common axioms only on the case by case basis it must be the business of the first philosophy to investigate their fundamentals for that when equals are subtracted from equals the remainders are equal is common to all quantities but mathematics singles out and investigates some portion of its proper matter as e g lines or angles or numbers or some other sort of quantity not however qua being but as continuous met 1061 b my translation the science of philosopher otherwise called the first philosophy is aristotle s logic which in his under standing is closely related to if not indistinguishable from what we call today ontology after alexandrian doing and showing 11 however important this aristotle s argument in the history of western thought may be i see no reason to take it for granted every time when we try today to interpret euclid s elements or any other old mathematical text whatever is one s philosophical stance concerning the place of logical principles in human reasoning one can see what kind of harm can be made if aristotle s assumption about the primacy of logical and ontological principles is taken straightforwardly and uncritically one treats euclid s axioms on equal footing with premisses like con 1 3 and hyp and so misses the law like character of the axioms missing this feature doesn t allow one to see the relationships between greek logic and greek mathematics which i just sketched having said that i would like to repeat that euclid s proof apodeixis is the part of euclid s theorems which more resembles what we today call proof in logic than other parts euclid s theorems for this reason in what follows i shall call inferences in euclid s proofs which are based on axioms protological inferences and distinguish them from inferences of another type that i shall call geometrical inferences this analysis is not incompatible with the idea going back to aristotle that behind euclid s protological and geometrical inferences there are inferences of a more fundamental sort that can be called logical in the proper sense of the word however i claim that euclid s text as it stands provides us with no evidence in favor of this strong assumption one can learn euclid s mathematics and fully appreciate its rigor without knowing anything about logic just like moliere s m jourdain could well express himself long before he learned anything about prose whether or not the science of logic really helps one to improve on mathematical rigor or this is rather the mathematical rigor that helps one to do logic rigorously is a controversial question that i postpone until the second part of this paper the purpose of my present reading of euclid is at the same time more modest and more ambitious than the purpose of logical analysis it is more modest because this reading doesn t purport to assess euclid s reasoning from the viewpoint of today s mathematics and logic but aims at reconstructing this reasoning in its authentic archaic form it is more ambitious because it doesn t take the today s viewpoint for granted but aims at reconsidering this viewpoint by bringing it into a historical perspective 4 instantiation and objectivity let us now see where the premises hyp and con 1 3 come from as i have already mentioned they actually come from two different sources hyp is assumed by hypotheis while con 1 3 are assumed by construction i shall consider here these two cases one after the other the notion of hypothetic reasoning is an important extension of the core notion of axiomatic theory described in section 1 above it is well treated in the literature and i shall not cover it here in full i shall consider only one particular aspect of hypothetical reasoning as it librarians we call today the relevant collection of aristotle s texts by the name of metaphysics and also use this name for a relevant philosophical discipline 12 andrei rodin is present in euclid the hypothesis that validates hyp informally speaking amounts to the fact that theorem 1 5 tells us something about isosceles triangles rather than about objects of another sort the corresponding definition definition 1 20 tells us that two sides of the isosceles triangle are equal however to get from here to hyp one needs yet another step the enunciation of theorem 1 5 refers to isosceles triangles in general but hyp that is involved into the proof of this theorem concerns only particular triangle abc notice also that the proof concludes with the propositions abc acb and fbc gcb where abc acb fbc and gcb are angles which also concern only particular triangle abc this conclusion differs from the following conclusion of the whole theorem which almost verbatim repeats the enunciation and once again refers to isosceles triangles and their angles in general terms the wanted step that allows euclid to proceed from the enunciation to hyp is made in the exposition of this theorem which introduces triangle abc as an arbitrary representa tive of isosceles triangles in general in terms of modern logic this step can be described as the universal instantiation xp x p a x where p a x is the result of the substitution of individual constant a at the place of all free occurrences of variable x in p x the same notion of universal instantiation allows for interpreting euclid s specification in the obvious way the reciprocal backward step that allows euclid to obtain the conclusion of the theorem from the conclusion of the proof can be similarly described as the universal generalization p a xp x which is a valid rule only under certain conditions that i skip here as long as the exposition and the specification are interpreted in terms of the universal instantiation these operations are understood as logical inferences and accordingly as ele ment of proof in the modern sense of the word a somewhat different albeit not wholly in compatible interpretation of euclid s exposition and specification can be straightforwardly given in terms of kant s transcendental aesthetics and transcendental logic developed in his critique of pure reason 25 kant thinks of the traditional geometrical exposition not as a logical inference of one proposition from another but as a general procedure of the imagination for providing a concept with its image a representation of such a general procedure kant calls a schema of the given concept a 140 thus for kant any individual mathematical object like triangle abc always comes with a specific rule that one follows constructing this object in one s imagination and that provides a link between this object and its corresponding concept the concept of isosceles triangle in our example according to kant the representation of general concepts by imaginary individual objects which kant doing and showing 13 for short also describes as construction of concepts is the principal distinctive feature of mathematical thinking which distinguishes it from a philosophical speculation philosophical cognition is rational cognition from concepts mathematical cognition is that from the construction of concepts but to construct a concept means to exhibit a priori the intuition corresponding to it for the construction of a concept therefore a non empirical intuition is required which consequently as intuition is an individual object but that must nevertheless as the construction of a concept of a general representation express in the representation universal validity for all possible intuitions that belong under the same concept either through mere imagination in pure intuition or on paper in empirical intuition the individual drawn figure is empirical and nevertheless serves to express the concept without damage to its universality for in the case of this empirical intuition we have taken account only of the action of constructing the concept to which many determinations e g those of the magnitude of the sides and the angles are entirely indifferent and thus we have abstracted from these differences which do not alter the concept of the triangle philosophical cognition thus considers the particular only in the universal but mathematical cognition considers the universal in the particular indeed even in the individual a 713 4 b 741 2 kant s account can be understood as a further explanation of what the instantiation of mathematical concepts amounts to then one may claim that the kantian interpretation of euclid s exposition and specification is compatible with its interpretation as the universal instantiation in the modern sense however the kantian interpretation doesn t suggest by itself to interpret the instantiation as a logical procedure i e as an inference of a proposition from another proposition as the above quote makes it clear kant describes the instantiation as a cognitive procedure of a different sort now coming back to euclid we must first of all admit that the exposition and the spec ification of theorem 1 5 as they stand are too concise for preferring one philosophical interpretation rather than another euclid introduces an isosceles triangle through defi nition 1 20 providing no rule for constructing such a thing this example may serve as an evidence against the often repeated claim that every geometrical object considered by euclid is supposed to be constructed on the basis of postulates beforehand nevertheless given the important role of constructions in euclid s geometry which i explain in the next section the idea that every geometrical object in euclid has an associated construction rule appears very plausible there is also another interesting textual feature of euclid s specification that in my view makes the kantian interpretation more plausible notice the use of the first person in the specification of theorem 1 5 i say that in elements euclid uses this expression systematically in the specification of every theorem interpreting the specification in terms of universal instantiation one should of course dis regard this feature as merely rhetorical however it may be taken into account through the 14 andrei rodin following consideration while the enunciation of a theorem is a general proposition that can be best understood a la frege in the abstraction from any human or inhuman thinker i e independently of any thinking subject who might believe this proposition assert it refute it or do anything else about it the core of euclid s theorems beginning with their exposition involves an individual thinker individual subject that cannot and should not be wholly abstracted away in this context when euclid enunciates a theorem this enunci ation does not involve or at least is not supposed to involve any particularities of euclid s individual thinking the less this enunciation is affected by euclid s or anyone else s indi vidual writing and speaking style the better however the exposition and thespecification of the given theorem essentially involve an arbitrary choice of notation let abc be an isosceles triangle which is an individual choice made by an individual mathematician namely made by euclid on the occasion of writing his elements this individual choice of notation goes on par with what we have earlier described as instantiation i e the choice of one individual triangle triangle abc of the given type which serves euclid for proving the general theorem about all triangles of this type the exposition can be also naturally accompanied by drawing a diagram which in its turn involves the choice of a particular shape provided this shape is of the appropriate type to leave alone the choices of its further features like color etc thus when in the specification of theorem 1 5 we read i say that the angle abc is equal to acb we indeed do have good reason to take euclid s wording seriously for the sentence angle abc is equal to acb unlike the sentence for isosceles triangles the angles at the base are equal to one another has a feature that is relevant only to one particular presentation and to one particular diagram if any namely the use of letters a b c rather than some others the words i say that in the given context stress this situational character of the following sentence angle abc is equal to acb what matters in these words is of course not euclid s personality but the reference to a particular act of speech and cognition of an individual mathematician proving the same theorem on a different occasion euclid or anybody else could use other letters and another diagram of the appropriate type 4 a competent reader of euclid is supposed to know that the choice of letters in euclid s notation is arbitrary and that euclid s reasoning does not depend of this choice the arbitrary character of this notation should be distinguished from the general arbitrariness of linguistic symbols in natural languages what is specific for the case of exposition and specification is the fact that here the arbitrary elements of reasoning like notation are sharply distinguished from its invariant elements to use kant s term we can say that behind the notion according to which the choice of euclid s notation is arbitrary at least at the degree that letters used in this notation are permutable and according to which the same reasoning may work equally well with different diagrams provided all 4 although the choice of letters in euclid s notation is arbitrary the system of this notation is not this traditional geometrical notation has a relatively stable and rather sophisticated syntax which i briefly describe in what follows doing and showing 15 of them belong to the same appropriate type there is a certain invariant schema that sharply limits such possible choices this schema not simply allows for making some arbitrary choices but requires every possible choice in the given reasoning to be wholly arbitrary this requirement is tantamount to saying that subjective reasons behind choices made by an individual mathematician for presenting a given mathematical argument are strictly irrelevant to the argument itself in spite of the fact that the argument cannot be formulated without making such choices in general talks in natural languages there is no similar sharp distinction between arbitrary and invariant elements when i write this paper i can certainly change some wordings without changing the sense of my argument but i am not in a position to describe precisely the scope of such possible changes and identify the intended sense of my argument with a mathematical rigor this is because my present study is philosophical and historical but not purely mathematical thus the instantiation of a universal proposition enunciation by a particular geometrical example like triangle abc euclid s exposition serves for the formulation of this universal proposition in terms which are suitable for a particular act of mathematical cognition made by an individual mathematician this aspect of the exposition is not accounted for by the modern notion of universal instantiation itself it may be argued that this further aspect of the exposition needs not be addressed in a logical analysis of euclid s mathematics that aims at explication of the objective meaning of euclid s reasoning and should not care about cognitive aspects of this reasoning i agree that this latter issue lies out of the scope of logical analysis in the usual sense of the term but i disagree that the objective meaning of euclid s reasoning can be made explicit without addressing this issue euclid s mathematical reasoning is objective due to a mechanism that allows one to make universally valid inferences through one s individual thinking whatever the objective meaning might consist of this mechanism must be taken into account 5 logical deduction and geometrical production remind that the proof of euclid s theorem 1 5 uses not only premiss hyp assumed by hypothesis but also premisses con 1 3 as well as a number of other premisses of the same type assumed by construction i turn now to the question about the role of euclid s constructions which but the way are ubiquitous not only in geometrical but also in arithmetical books of the elements and more specifically consider the question how these constructions support certain premisses that are used in following proofs as it is well known euclid s geometrical constructions are supposed to be realized by ruler and compass in the elements this condition is expressed in the elements through the following three postulates 1 let it have been postulated to draw a straight line from any point to any point 16 andrei rodin 2 and to produce a finite straight line continuously in a straight line 3 and to draw a circle with any center and radius i leave out of my present discussion two further euclid s postulates including the contro versial fifth postulate before i consider popular interpretations of these postulates and suggest my own inter pretation let me briefly discuss the very term postulate which is traditionally used in english translations of euclid s elements fitzpatrick translates euclid s verb aitein by english verb to postulate following the long tradition of latin translations where this greek verb is translated by latin verb postulare however according to today s stan dard dictionaries the modern english verb to postulate does not translate the greek verb aitein and the the latin verb postulare in general contexts the modern dictionaries translate these verbs into to demand or to ask for this clearly shows that the meaning of the english verb to postulate that derives from latin postulare changed during its lifetime 5 aristotle describes a postulate aitema as what is assumed when the learner either has no opinion on the subject or is of a contrary opinion an post 76 b further he draws a contrast between postulates and hypotheses saying that the latter appear more plausible to the learner than the former ibid it is unnecessary for my present purpose to go any further into this semantical analysis trying to reconstruct an epistemic attitude that euclid might have in mind demanding the reader to take his postulates for granted the purpose of the above philological remark is rather to warn the reader that the modern meaning of the english word postulate can easily mislead when one tries to interpret euclid s postulates adequately so i suggest to read euclid s postulates as they stand and try to reconstruct their meaning from their context forgetting for a while what one has learned about the meaning of the term postulate from modern sources euclid s postulates are usually interpreted as propositions of a certain type and on this basis are qualified as axioms in the modern sense of the term there are at least two different ways of rendering postulates in a propositional form i shall demonstrate them at the example of postulate 1 this postulate can be interpreted either as the following modal proposition pm 1 given two different points it is always possible to drawing a segment of straight line between these points or as the following existential proposition 5 i reproduce here fitzpatrick s footnote about euclid s expression let it be postulated the greek present perfect tense indicates a past action with present significance hence the 3 rd person present perfect imperative hitesthw could be translated as let it be postulated in the sense let it stand as postulated but not let the postulate be now brought forward the literal translation let it have been postulated sounds awkward in english but more accurately captures the meaning of the greek doing and showing 17 pe 1 for any two different points there exists a segment of straight line lying between these points propositional interpretations of euclid s postulates allow one to present euclid s geometry as an axiomatic theory in the modern sense of the word and more specifically to present euclid s geometrical constructions as parts of proofs of his theorems even before the modern notion of axiomatic theory was strictly defined in formal terms many translators and commentators of euclid s elements tended to think about his theory in this way and interpreted euclid s postulates in the modal sense later a number of authors 21 24 proposed different formal reconstructions of euclid s geometry based on the existential reading of postulates according to hintikka remes r eliance on auxiliary construction does not take us outside the axiomatic framework of geometry auxiliary constructions are in fact little more than ancient counterparts to applications of modern instantiation rules 22 p 270 the instantiation rules work in this context as follows first through the universal in stantiation which under this reading correspond to euclid s exposition and specification one gets some propositions like hyp about certain particular objects individuals like ab and ac then one uses postulates 1 3 reading them as existential axioms according to which the existence of certain geometrical objects implies the existence of certain further geometrical objects and so proves the hypothetical existence of such further objects of in terest finally one uses another instantiation rule called the rule of existential instantiation xp x p a and thus gets these new objects under this interpretation euclid s constructions turn into logical inferences of sort as hintikka remes emphasize in their paper the principal distinctive feature of euclid s constructions under their interpretation is that these con structions introduce some new individuals they call such individuals new in the sense that these individuals are not and cannot be introduced through the universal instanti ation of hypotheses making part the enunciation of the given theorem the propositional interpretations of euclid s postulates are illuminating because they allow for analyzing traditional geometrical constructions in modern logical terms however they require a paraphrasing of euclid s wording which from a logical point of view is far from being innocent in order to see this let us leave aside the epistemic attitude expressed by the verb postulate and focus on the question of what euclid postulates in his postulates 1 3 literally he postulates the following p 1 to draw a straight line from any point to any point p 2 to produce a finite straight line continuously in a straight line p 3 to draw a circle with any center and radius 18 andrei rodin as they stand expressions p 1 3 don t qualify as propositions they rather describe certain operations and making up a proposition from something which is not a proposition is not a innocent step my following analysis is based on the idea that postulates are not primitive truths from which one may derive some further truths but are primitive operations that can be combined with each other and so produce into some further operations in order to make my reading clear i paraphrase p 1 3 as follows op 1 drawing a segment of straight line between its given endpoints op 2 continuing a segment of given straight line indefinitely in a straight line op 3 drawing a circle by given radius a segment of straight line and center which is supposed to be one of the two endpoints of the given ra dius noticeably none of op 1 3 allows for producing geometrical constructions out of nothing each of these fundamental operation produces a geometrical object out of some other objects which are supposed to be given in advance the table below specifies inputs operands and outputs results of op 1 3 operation input output op 1 two different points straight segment op 2 straight segment bigger straight segment op 3 straight segment and one of its endpoints circle pe 1 as it stands does not imply that there exists at least one point or at least one line in euclid s geometrical universe if there are no points then there are no lines either similar remarks can be made about the existential interpretation of other euclid s postilates thus the existential interpretation of postulates by itself does not turn these postulates into existential axioms that guarantee that euclid s universe is non empty and contains all geometrical objects constructible by ruler and compass to meet this purpose one also needs to postulate the existence of at least two different points and then argue that the absence of any counterpart of such an axiom in euclid is due to euclid s logical incompetence my proposed interpretation of postulates 1 3 as operations doesn t require such ad hoc stipulations and thus is more faithful not only to euclid s text but also to a deeper structure of his reasoning 6 hintikka remes describe euclid s geometrical constructions as auxiliary such a de scription may be adequate to the role of geometrical constructions in today s practice of teaching the elementary geometry but not to the role of constructions in euclid s elements remind that euclid s so called propositions are of two types some of them are theorems 6 remind that the concepts of infinite straight line and infinite half line ray are absent from euclid s geometry thus the result of op 2 is always a finite straight segment however the result of op 2 is obviously not fully determined by its single operand this shows that op 2 doesn t really fit the today s usual notion of algebraic operation doing and showing 19 while some other are problems see again the above quotation from proclus commentary in the elements problems are at least as important as theorems and arguably even more important in fact the elements begin and end with a problem but not with a theo rem as we shall now see when a given construction makes part of a problem rather than a theorem it cannot be described as auxiliary in any appropriate sense we shall also see the modern title proposition is not really appropriate when we talk about euclid s problems while enunciations of theorems do qualify as propositions in the modern logical sense of the term enunciations of problems do not i shall demonstrate these features at the well known example of problem 1 1 that opens eu clid s elements my notational conventions remain the same as in the example of theorem 1 5 enunciation to construct an equilateral triangle on a given finite straight line exposition let ab be the given finite straight line 20 andrei rodin specification so it is required to construct an equilateral triangle on the straight line ab construction let the circle bcd with center a and radius ab have been drawn post 3 and again let the circle ace with center b and radius ba have been drawn post 3 and let the straight lines ca and cb have been joined from the point c where the circles cut one another to the points a and b post 1 doing and showing 21 proof and since the point a is the center of the circle cdb ac is equal to ab def 1 15 again since the point b is the center of the circle cae bc is equal to ba def 1 15 but ca was also shown to be equal to ab thus ca and cb are each equal to ab but things equal to the same thing are also equal to one another axiom 1 thus ca is also equal to cb thus the three straight lines ca ab and bc are equal to one another conclusion thus the triangle abc is equilateral and has been constructed on the given finite straight line ab which is the very thing it was required to do as one can see at this example enunciations of problems are expressed in the same gram matical form as postulates 1 3 namely in the form of infinitive verbal expressions i read these expressions in the same straightforward way in which i read postulates as de scriptions of certain geometrical operations the obvious difference between enunciations of problems and postulates is this while postulates introduce basic operations taken for granted drawing by ruler and compass problems describe complex operations which in the last analysis reduce to these basic operations such reduction is made through a construction of a given problem it performs the complex operation described in the enunciation of the problem through combining basic operations op 1 3 and possibly some earlier performed complex operations the procedure that allows for performing com plex operations by combining a small number of repeatable basic operations i shall call a geometrical production in problem 1 1 the construction of regular triangle is geometri cally produced from drawing the straight line between two given points postulate 1 and drawing a circle by given center and radius postulate 3 this is of course just another way of saying that the regular triangle is constructed by ruler and compass the unusual terminology helps me to describe euclid s geometrical constructions more precisely let us see in more detail how works euclid s geometrical production basic operations op 1 3 like other complex operations need to be performed in order to produce an output they have to be fed by some input this input is provided through the exposition of the given problem the straight line ab in the above example op 1 3 are composed in the usual way well known from today s algebra outputs of earlier performed operations are used as inputs for further operations 7 7 problem 1 1 involves a difficulty that has been widely discussed in the literature euclid does not provide any principle that may allow him to construct a point of intersection of the two circles involved into the construction of this problem this flaw is usually described as a logical flow in my view it is more appropriate to describe this flow as properlygeometrical and fill the gap in the reasoning by the following additional postulate rather than an additional axiom 22 andrei rodin just like postulates 1 3 enunciations of problems can be read as modal or existential propositions in the modern logical sense of the term then the modified enunciation of problem 1 1 reads 1 1 m it is possible to construct a regular triangle on a given finite straight line or 1 1 e for all finite straight line there exists a regular triangle on this line as soon as the enunciations of euclid s problems are rendered into the propositional form the problems turn into theorems of a special sort in the case of existential interpretation problems turn into existential theorems that state under certain hypotheses that there exist certain objects having certain desired properties however this is not what we find in euclid s text as it stands every euclid s problem ends with the formula the very thing it was required to do not to show or to prove i can see no evidence in the elements that justifies the idea that in euclid s mathematics doing is less significant than showing and that the former is in some sense reducible to the latter in the second part of this paper i shall argue that doing remains as much important in today s mathematics as it was in greek mathematics and that the idea of reducing mathematics to showing or proving in the precise sense of modern logic is a unfortunate philosophical misconception according to another popular reading euclid s problems are tasks or questions of sort this version of modal propositional interpretation of euclid s problems involves a deontic modality rather than a possibility modality 1 1 d it is required to construct a regular triangle on a given finite straight line indeed geometrical problems similar to euclid s problems can be found in today s elemen tary geometry textbooks as exercises however the analogy between euclid s problems and school problems on construction by ruler and compass is not quite precise enunciations of euclid s problems just like the enunciations of euclid s theorems prima facie express no modality whatsoever a deontic expression appears only in the exposition of the given problem it is required to construct an equilateral triangle on the straight line ab i don t think that this fact justifies the deontic reading of the enunciation because as i have already explained above the exposition describes reasoning of an individual mathematician rather than presents this reasoning in an objective form that every complex construction must be performed through postulates and earlier performed constructions is an epistemic requirement which is on par with the requirement according to which every theorem must be proved rather than simply stated remind that the expositions of euclid s theorems let it have been postulated to produce a point of intersection of two circles with a common radius even if this additional postulates is introduced here purely ad hoc the way in which it is introduced gives an idea of how euclid s postulates could emerge in the real history doing and showing 23 have the form i say that this indeed makes an apparent contrast with the expositions of problems that have the form it is required to however this contrast doesn t seem me to be really sharp euclid s expression i say that in the given context is inter changeable with the expression it is required to show that which matches the closing formula of theorems this is the very thing it was required to show euclid s expression it is required to that he uses in the expositions of problems similarly matches the closing formula of problems this is the very thing it was required to do the require ment according to which every theorem must be shown or monstrated doesn t imply of course that the enunciation statement of this theorem has a deontic meaning the requirement according to which every problem must be done doesn t imply either that the enunciation of this problem has something to do with deontic modalities the analogy between axioms and theorems on the one hand and postulates and prob lems on the other hand may suggest that euclid s geometry splits into two independent parts one of which is ruled by proto logical deduction while the other is ruled by geomet rical production however this doesn t happen and in fact problems and theorems turn to be mutually dependent elements of the same theory the above example of problem 1 1 and theorem 1 5 show how the intertwining of problems and theorems works the orems generally involve constructions called in this case auxiliary which may depend in the order of geometrical production on earlier treated problems as the construction of theorem 1 5 depends on problem 1 3 problems in their turn always involve appro priate proofs that prove that the construction of the given theorem indeed performs the operation described in the enunciation of this theorem rather than performs some other operation such proofs generally depend in the order of the protological deduction on certain earlier treated theorems just like in the case of proofs of theorems although this mechanism linking problems with theorems may look unproblematic it gives rise to the following puzzle geometrical production produces geometrical objects from some other objects protological deduction deduces certain propositions from some other propositions how it then may happen that the geometrical production has an impact on the protological deduction in particular how the geometrical production may justify premises assumed by construction so these premises are used in following proofs in order to answer this question let s come back to the premise con 3 af ag from theorem 1 5 and see what if anything makes it true af ag because euclid or any body else following euclid s instructions constructs this pair of straight segments in this way how do we know that by following these instructions one indeed gets the desired result this is because the construction of problem 1 3 that contains the appropriate instruction is followed by a proof that proves that this construction does exactly what it is required to do construction 1 3 in its turn uses construction 1 2 while construction 1 2 uses construction 1 1 quoted above in other words construction 1 1 geometrically produces construction 1 2 and construction 1 2 in its turn produces construction 1 3 this geometrical production produces the relevant part of construction 1 5 the construction of equal straight segments af and ag from first principles namely from postulates 1 3 in 24 andrei rodin order to get the corresponding protological deduction of premise con 3 from first princi ples we should now look at proofs 1 1 1 2 and 1 3 and then combine these three proofs into a single chain for economizing space i leave now details to reader and only report what we get in the end the result is somewhat surprising from the point of view of the modern logical analysis the chain of constructions leading to construction 1 5 involves a number of circles through postulate 3 radii of a given circle are equal by definition definition 1 15 thus by constructing a circle and its two radii say x and y one gets a primitive not supposed to be proved premise x y having at hand a number of premises of this form and using axioms as inference rules but not as premises one gets the desired deduction of con 3 the fact that first principles of the protological deduction of con 3 appear to be partly provided by a definition helps to explain why euclid places his definitions among other first principles such as postulates and axioms the above analysis allows for disentangling the protological deduction of con 3 from the geometrical production of straight segments af ag and so the aforementioned puzzle remains even after we have looked at euclid s reasoning under a microscope even if we can describe in detail the impact of problems to theorems and vice versa it remains unclear how the two kind of things can possibly work together here is my tentative answer to this question every euclid s proof involves only concrete premises like con 3 and hyp which are related to certain individual objects it is assumed that such a premise is valid only if the corresponding object is effectively constructed at least this concerns all premises by construction as we have seen at the example of theorem 1 5 hypothetic premises sometimes don t respect this rule this fundamental principle links euclid s geometrical production and protological deduction together one may argue that my proposed analysis after all is not significantly different from the standard logical analysis of euclid s geometrical reasoning according to which euclid first proves that certain geometrical objects exist and only then prove some further propositions concerning properties of these objects is there indeed any significant difference between proving that such and such object exist and producing this object through what i call the geometrical production there is of course a difference of a metaphysical sort between these two notions to produce an object is not quite the same thing as to prove that certain object exists but arguably this difference has no objective significance and so one may simply ignore it there is however a further difference between the geometrical production and the mathematical existence which seems me more important euclid s elements contain two sets of rules namely axioms and postulates supposed to be applied to operations of two different sorts axioms tell us how to derive equalities from other equalities while postulates tell us how to produce geometrical objects from other geometrical objects a logical analysis of euclid s geometry that involves a propositional in particular existential reading of postulates aims at replacing these two sets of rules by a single set of rules called logical i would like to stress again that the results my proposed analysis don t exclude the possibility of logical analysis such a replacement may be or be not a good idea but in any event logical rules are not made in the euclid s text explicit and i don t see much doing and showing 25 point in saying that he uses rules of this sort implicitly the fact that we can use today modern logic for interpreting euclid is a completely different issue an interpretation of euclid s geometry by means of logical analysis can be indeed illuminating but one should not confuse oneself by believing that euclid already had a grasp of modern logic even if could not formulate principles of this logic explicitly at the same the combination of protological deduction and geometrical production found in euclid may shed some light on modern logic and its involved relationships with mathematics as we shall shortly see for further references i shall call the 6 part structure of euclid s problems and theorems euclidean structure as the above analysis makes clear the euclidean structure doesn t work with the modern notion of axiomatic theory but requires a different setting which combines the protological deduction with the geometrical production let us now see what the euclidean structure can tell us about today s mathematics part 2 modern axiomatic method 6 euclid and modern mathematics what has been said above may give one an impression that in euclid s elements we deal with an archaic pattern of mathematical thinking that has noting to do with today s math ematics however this impression is wrong in fact the euclidean structure is apparently present in today s mathematics perhaps in a slightly modified form consider the following example taken from a standard mathematical textbook 27 p 100 my translation into english theorem 3 any closed subset of a compact space is compact proof let f be a closed subset of compact space t and f be an arbitrary centered system of closed subsets of subspace f t then every f is also closed in t and hence f is a centered system of closed sets in t therefore f 6 by theorem 1 it follows that f is compact although the above theorem is presented in the usual for today s mathematics form proposition proof its euclidean structure can be made explicit without re interpretations and paraphrasing enunciation any closed subset of a compact space is compact exposition let f be a closed subset of compact space t 26 andrei rodin specification absent construction let f be an arbitrary centered system of closed subsets of subspace f t proof e very f is also closed in t and hence f is a centered system of closed sets in t therefore f 6 by theorem 1 it follows that f is compact conclusion absent the absent specification can be formulated as follows i say that f is a compact space while the absent conclusion is supposed to be a literal repetition of the enunciation of this theorem clearly these latter elements can be dropped for parsimony reason in order to better separate the construction and the proof of the above theorem the authors could first construct set f and only then prove that it is non empty however this variation of the classical euclidean scheme also seems me negligible i propose the reader to check it at other modern examples that the euclidean structure remains today at work does this mean that the modern notion of axiomatic theory is inadequate to today s mathematical practice just like it is inadequate to euclid s mathematics such a conclusion would be too hasty arguably in spite of the fact that today s mathematics preserves some traditional outlook it is essentially different so the euclidean appearance of today s mathematics cannot be a sufficient evidence for the claim the the euclidean structure remains significant in it in order to justify this claim a different argument is needed before i try to provide such an argument i would like to point to the fact that the modern notion of axiomatic theory is used in today s mathematics in two rather different ways first it is used as a broad methodological idea that determines the general architecture of a theory but has no impact on details such an application of the modern axiomatic method is usually called informal second the notion of axiomatic theory is used for building formal theories that contain a list of axioms and a set of theorems derived from these axioms according to explicitly specified rules of logical inference in the next section i shall describe the notion of formal axiomatic theory more precisely and try to explain why it is called formal here i would like only to stress that only in a formal setting the modern notion of axiomatic theory is made explicit and that the informal application of this notion in the current mathematical practice depends on the assumption that the informal mathematics can be appropriately formalized thus in order to test the modern notion of axiomatic theory against today s mathematical practice we should first of all look at formal theories and analyze what the formalization of the informal mathematics amounts to doing and showing 27 7 formalization while the concept of formalization is rather epistemological than purely mathematical the concept of formal axiomatic theory admits a rigorous mathematical definition this rigor comes with a price mathematical definitions of formal theory vary from one textbook to another see for example 26 and 28 yet there is a common understanding that such special definitions share a common conceptual core which i shall try to present here the definition of formal axiomatic theory that i give below is not the most general and not the most precise strictly speaking it doesn t qualify as a mathematical definition i consider only the case of deductive theory that is relevant to the axiomatic method thus a deductive formal theory consists of the following a a formal language that includes an alphabet of symbols and rules of building formulae from symbols of this alphabet b a list of axioms of the given theory which is a distinguished set of well formed formulae of the theory formulae which are not axioms are called theorems c rules of inference of formulae from other formulae the inference of formulae from other formulae is called deduction as far as rules of inference work universally for all theories or at least for a large class of theories the deduction is called logical one usually further assumes that a given formal theory can be interpreted an inter pretation assigns truth values to formulae of the theory interpretations under which the axioms of the given theory are true is called a model of this theory as far as rules of inference are truth preserving which is the usual requirement all theorems deduced from axioms are also true in every model of the given theory thus a formal theory such that all its theorems are deduced from axioms is a concrete mathematical realization of the in formal notion of axiomatic theory discussed earlier canonical examples of formal theories are peano arithmetics pa and an axiomatic theory of sets called zf after zermelo and fraenkel 8 the notion of formal theory allows for more precise definitions of concepts of theory axiom and theorem than usual however it is appropriate to ask whether or not such precise definitions adequately capture the meaning of the corresponding terms which is known from the usual informal mathematical practice is a formal theory really a theory is a formal mathematical theorem in the sense of the above definition really a mathematical theorem asking these questions i don t assume that the meanings of terms theory and theorem live somewhere on platonic heavens or in the current practice and need only be described correctly i rather assume that our concepts of theory theorem etc are formed through our attempts to improve upon the existing theoretical practice in the pure mathematics and elsewhere so the above question can be more precisely formulated as follows are formal mathematical theories indeed able to replace the so called informal theories in practice do they really do this at least at certain degree is there an advantage 8 there exist many different versions of pa and zf but i don t need to be more specific about them here 28 andrei rodin of doing mathematics formally rather than informally if the answers to these questions are in positive then one may argue that even if the existing mathematical practice remains largely informal a formalization of mathematics remains a sound project for the future one may also argue that in spite of the fact that today s mathematical theories still look like the theory of euclid s elements in certain respects the core structure of these today s theories is very different and can be better described with the modern notion of axiomatic theory finally one may argue that to make this core structure explicit one has to formalize today s mathematical theories i e rewrite them as formal theories in the above precise sense before i try to answer the above questions and evaluate the above argument on this basis i would like to make some historical remarks concerning the notion of being formal i shall talk first about formal logic and then about formal approaches in mathematics the term formal logic has a long history that i shall not try to trace here but only stress the fact that the meaning of this term changed drastically during last several centuries for example kant s notion of formal logic as distinguished from the transcendental logic is quite different from our modern notion of formal logic as distinguished from the so called informal logic let me now talk only about the modern notion today people tend to qualify as formal any logical theory that uses mathematical symbolic methods and corre spondingly qualify as informal any account of logic that does not systematically applies such methods but presents itself with a prose written in some natural language although the application of mathematical methods in logic is not a recent idea new applications of mathematical methods in logic in the late 19 th early 20 th centuries produced a genuine revolution in logic and brought about the formal logic in the modern sense of the term this historical remark makes clear the reason why the modern formal logic is more rigorous than the traditional logic and it also allows one to specify the claim the modern formal logic is more rigorous than the traditional logic because it systematically applies mathe matical methods for the same reason newtonian physics is more rigorous than wolfian physics which expresses itself with a prose one should not forget that we are talking here about a mathematical rigor which arguably is not the only kind of rigor that one can possibly attain in a given field of research although the notion of formal mathematical theory has a much shorter history the meaning of the term also changed during the 20 th century in the beginning of this century this term referred to the then novel sort of theories a canonical example of which was given by hilbert in his book on foundations of geometry 20 first published in 1899 such theories were called formal in the contradistinction with traditional contentual theories because they involved the associated notion of interpretation described in the beginning of this section although formal theories in the modern sense of the term also allow for interpretations this feature is no longer seen as sufficient for calling a theory formal in particular the geometrical theory developed by hilbert in 20 does not qualify as formal in today s sense doing and showing 29 now we are better prepared to discuss formalization of mathematics and evaluate its epistemic consequences formalization of an existing informal mathematical theory t is a way of reformulating t in new terms such a procedure brings about a formal theory f which in some sense expresses the same mathematical content as t but arguably has some epistemic advantages over t it is worth to note that reformulations of older theories in new terms occurred in mathematics permanently through its long history what we call euclidean geometry today differs strikingly from what one can read in the geometrical chapters of euclid s elements and still there is a sense in which the two things repre sent the same mathematical theory to make this sense precise and specify some general principles allowing for an adequate translation of mathematical theories from one setting to another remains in my view a challenging and wholly open problem in philosophy of mathematics i am not trying to solve this problem here but nevertheless mention it because i think that the long existing practice of reformulating mathematical theories in new terms is an appropriate historical background for understanding formalization now comparing formalization with similar shifts occurred in mathematics in the past like translation of traditional geometrical problems into an algebraic language in the late 17 th century one can observe that so far formalization was not quite successful although a study of formal theories developed into a well established area of mathematics see be low the mainstream mathematics remained largely informal none of recent significant advances in mathematics like the recent proof of poincare conjecture involved formal methods in the sense of formal specified above true an evaluation of success of for malization of mathematics depends on what one expects to achieve with it and there is no stable consensus about this issue even among those people who think about formalization enthusiastically anyway the very fact that studies in formal mathematics is currently a relatively isolated area largely ignored by the mainstream deserves in my view a very serious consideration an apparent exception is the set theory after the discovery of famous paradoxes of so called naive set theory zermelo famously proposed a sketch of formal axiomatic theory of sets aimed at saving the set theory from inconsistencies since then the mainstream research in set theory focused on studies on various formal theories of sets of models of such theories in the rest of mathematics people continued to use sets widely in the informal manner with an official proviso according to which the informal concept of set is nothing but a naive version of the set concepts treated rigorously by the set theorists with formal means although the research into formal set theories brought about a lot of mathematical results about these theories it is less clear that it augmented our knowledge about sets themselves think of continuum hypothesis ch go del 13 discovered that zf is consistent with ch by building a model of zf in which ch holds and later cohen 6 discovered that zf is consistent with the negation of ch by building a model of zf in which ch does not hold so we know now that neither ch nor its negation can be derived from the axioms of zf however important this result may be it does not provide any definite answer to the original question neither it allows to claim that the original question is ill posed so that no definite answer exists an additional axiom or some 30 andrei rodin wholly new system of axioms for set theory may eventually help of course to settle the problem in the sense that ch or its negation can be deduced from the new system of axiom there are obvious trivial solutions of this sort then however it remains to show that the system of axiom for set theory solving the ch problem is a right one and so the proposed solution is genuine i cannot see how this can be done on purely mathematical grounds any possible argument to the effect that one system of axioms for set theory is more natural than some other has a speculative nature and lacks any objective validity even if one gets some non trivial proof of ch from some system of axioms that appear to be in some sense natural one can hardly claim that this system of axioms is the right one solely because it solves the ch problem and because such a proposed solution is smart and elegant it may be argued that the formal axiomatic framework makes explicit a relativistic na ture of mathematics which we should learn to live with according to this viewpoint it is pointless to ask whether ch is true or false without further qualifications and all that mathematicians can do is to study which axioms do imply ch modulo some specified rules of inference which imply its negation and which do neither like the axioms of zf more generally the only thing that mathematics can do is to provide true propositions of the if then form if such and such propositions are true then certain other propositions are also true i cannot see how such a deductive relativism or if thenism about math ematics can be sustainable it is incompatible not only with the common mathematical practice but also more specifically with the current practice of studying formal axiomatic systems consider the statement s of independence of ch from the axioms of zf that i have mentioned earlier s is commonly seen as an established theorem on a par with any other firmly established mathematical theorem however s is not of the if then form moreover the proof of s that comprises the construction of go del s model l verifying ch and cohen s forcing construction falsifying ch is a piece of rather sophisticated usual or naive mathematics but not a formal inference within certain axiomatic theory a consistent if thenist would not hold without further qualifications that ch is independent from the axioms of zf but rather say that it depends of one s assumptions thus even in set theory informal proofs like the proof of independence of ch from axioms of zf apparently remain indispensable in spite of the fact that that the modern set theory no longer considers sets naively but works instead with various formal axiomatic theories of sets this modern theory like any other modern mathematical theory relies on non formalized proofs what is specific for the modern set theory is its object rather than its method instead of studying sets directly in the same way in which say group theorists study groups set theorists study formal axiomatic theories of sets however the methods used by modern set theorists are not essentially different from methods used in other parts of today s mathematics it remains in my sense an open methodological question whether or not such a roundabout way of studying sets has indeed proved effective true at the present there is no clear alternative to it however it is not inconceivable that in the near future the mathematical community may bring about an improved naive concept of set doing and showing 31 that would allow one to study sets like groups it is not inconceivable that such an old fashioned way of thinking about sets could after all allow for a real progress in the ch problem in any event it seems me important to keep such a possibility open and not try to take it out of the table using some philosophical arguments the description of sets as homotopy zero types suggested by j p marquis is a tentative realization of this idea 9 the distinction between a theory and meta theory and more generally between math ematics and meta mathematics which dates back to hilbert is helpful for making things clearer in modern set theory a theory is zf or another formal axiomatic theory while proofs of independence of ch from the axioms of zf and similar results belong to a meta theory that tell us important things about formal axiomatic theories i would like however to point here to the fact that this standard terminology is heavily philosophically laden and suggests a very particular view on mathematics namely it suggests the view according to which formal axiomatic theories are usual mathematical theories while meta theories belong to a special domain of meta mathematics that lays beyond the usual mathematics and has some philosophical flavor but if we leave philosophy aside and describe the same situation in the context of the current mathematical practice we observe quite the opposite formal axiomatic theories are not mathematical theories in the usual sense of the word while their corresponding meta theories look like usual theories from any other area of mathematics by the analogy with the distinction between an object language and a meta language in formal semantic it would be more appropriate to use the term object theory for what in formal axiomatic studies but not in the rest of mathematics is usually called simply a theory as far as we are talking about meta theories in a mathematical context such theories are mathematical theories at the first place whatever philosophical meaning one may wish to attach to them and their corresponding object theories are mathematical objects rather than theories at the first place this remark makes it clear where the power of formal ization comes from not surprisingly the case of formalization of mathematics turns to be similar to the case of formalization of logic formalization of mathematical theories turns these theories into mathematical objects of sort this allows for studying mathematically a class of important problems that earlier were studied only speculatively or informally these are so called meta mathematical problems concerning the mutual in dependence of mathematical theories provability etc during 80 years of such studies there were ob tained a number of firm mathematical results including in particular the independence results about ch mentioned above the properly mathematical aspect of these result should be sharply distinguished from associated philosophical claims the objective va lidity of the former doesn t extend to the latter so the idea that meta mathematics is in a position to prove philosophical claims by mathematical methods cannot be justified qua mathematical results all meta mathematical results concern only formalized theories which consequences if any these meta mathematical results may have for mathematics 9 presented at the workshop sets within geometry nancy france july 26 29 2011 32 andrei rodin in general is a further question that is not mathematical in character only if one assumes that formal object theories represent usual mathematical theories adequately one may claim that the meta mathematical results have a direct bearing on these usual theories let me stress once again that the aforementioned assumption is not mathematical in char acter it is a very general assumption about mathematics that tell us what mathematics is and what it should be one cannot possibly prove or disprove such an assumption by using purely mathematical arguments there remains then the following three possibilities which are not mutually exclusive one may come up with an idea what mathematics should be on purely speculative grounds one may also look attentively what mathematics actually is and what it used to be in the past and form one s general ideas about mathematics on this ground finally one my try to change the current mathematical practice according to one s view on mathematics developed on speculative grounds in reality every researcher in the field cannot avoid com bining all the three approaches in one way or another the main virtue of speculation is that it allows for changing usual ideas about mathematics however unless such new ideas are tested against the practice they remain merely speculative and their value remain uncertain the main virtue of the careful analysis of the past and present mathematical practice is that it provides a necessary background for any attempted reform of this prac tice it is clear that formalization of logic and mathematics has opened some new fields of mathematical studies but it remains so far unclear what bearing if any the results of these studies have on the rest of mathematics the persisting gap between the common mathematical practice and its formalized counterpart that is apparent not only in formal reconstructions of older mathematics but also in today s mathematics suggests that some thing goes wrong with the formalization however impressive proven mathematical facts about formal object theories may be these facts don t provide by themselves any substance to the claim that the theory objects can substitute usual mathematical theories out side the context of their informal meta theories formal object theories have no objective mathematical content just like euclidean triangles have no objective mathematical content outside the context of euclidean geometry one may argue as follows true any formal object theory requires some supporting meta theory such a meta theory can be also formalized in its turn this starts an infinite regress that leads nowhere one cannot and shouldn t formalize everything this is why a reasonable attitude is to build the core mathematics formally using for this end some necessary informal meta mathematical arguments even if this informal instrument cannot be then wholly taken away like the wittgenstein s ladder it can be viewed as a part of general philosophical underpinning of mathematics rather than as a part of mathematics proper once again i insist that the above reasoning is based on an a priori view about mathematics that is not confirmed neither by the old nor by the new mathematics the very fact that a mathematical object of a particular sort is called a theory and is supposed to represent doing and showing 33 a theory doesn t provide any substance to the claim that it indeed represents a theory in some strong sense of the word 8 objectivity and objecthood in modern mathematics the above critical remarks about formalization don t imply that formalization is a bad idea however they show that the usual way of formalizing mathematical theories in volves a systematic difficulty i claim that what is wrong in it is the usual informal notion of axiomatic theory namely the notion according to which a theory in general and mathematical theory in particular is a bunch of propositions generated by a finite list of propositions called axioms according certain rules of logical inference in fact this idea dates back to aristotle and thus is far from being modern this aris totelian notion of theory had apparently little or no influence on greek mathematics that followed euclid rather than aristotle but it became quite influential in the medieval scholasticism in particular in the scholastic physics the early modern mathematically laden science that triumphed with newton s principia largely rejected the old scholastic pattern of theory building and developed a very different notion of scientific theory that was best described in general terms by kant in his critique of the pure reason kantian philosophy of science and mathematics remained the mainstream until the beginning of the 20 th century when the old scholastic pattern of theory building kicked back under the new name of modern axiomatic method let me briefly sketch this latter development in kant s view the objectivity of pure mathematics which underlies the objectivity of the mathematically laden empirical science has its source in its objecthood i e in the univer sal schemata according to which one constructs mathematical objects but not just in the universal character of the involved concepts this according to kant is a crucial difference between the mathematical reasoning and the philosophical speculation give a philosopher the concept of triangle and let him try to find out in his way how the sum of its angles might be related to a right angle he has nothing but the concept of figure enclosed by three straight lines and in it the concept of equally many angles now he may reflect on his concept as long as he wants yet he will never produce anything new he can analyze and make distinct the concept of a straight line or of an angle or of the number three but he will not come upon any other properties that do not already lie in these concepts but now let the geometer take up this question he begins at once to construct a triangle since he knows that two right angles together are exactly equal to all of the adjacent angles that can be drawn at one point on a straight line he extends one side of his triangle and obtains two adjacent angles that together are equal to the two right ones in such a way through a chain of inferences that is always guided by intuition he arrives at a fully illuminated and at the same time general solution of the question critique of pure reason a 716 b 744 34 andrei rodin kant s philosophy of mathematics and mathematically laden science is based upon the best contemporary science represented by newton s principia 12 by this i don t mean of course that kant derives his philosophical claims from the principles of newtonian physics kant s critical philosophy rather aims at explaining how the type of knowledge best represented by the newtonian physics is possible as an objectively valid knowledge anyway this makes kant s philosophy strongly dependent of the contemporary mathemat ics and science h cohen p natorp and other neo kantians who wished to sustain the kantian project of critical philosophy in the 19 th century realized this fact very clearly and made efforts to incorporate into the kantian philosophy a historical dimension and make it to keep track of the current progress of science including the pure mathematics 16 it was not quite clear in the 19 th century and it still remains a controversial question today which if any features of kant s original approach remain sustainable in the context of the current science and mathematics and which features of this original approach are hopelessly outdated more radically one may wonder if there is anything at all in kant s analysis that has survived all the dramatic changes in science and pure mathematics that have happened since kant s own time in spite of a number of interesting attempts of up grading the kantian philosophy of mathematics in order to account for new mathematical developments such as the invention of non euclidean geometries at certain point the kan tian line in the philosophy of mathematics has been largely abandoned bertrand russell s intellectual develpment is representative in this sense after publishing in 1897 his essay on foundations of geometry 31 which is an explicit attempt to modernize kant s views on this subject already in 1903 russell publishes his principles of mathematics 32 where the author develops the subject on wholly new grounds in the introduction to this book russell explains his attitude to the kantian line of thought as follows it seemed plain that mathematics consists of deductions and yet the ortho dox accounts of deduction were largely or wholly inapplicable to existing mathematics not only the aristotelian syllogistic theory but also the mo dem doctrines of symbolic logic were either theoretically inadequate to mathematical reasoning or at any rate required such artificial forms of statement that they could not be practically applied in this fact lay the strength of the kantian view which asserted that mathematical reasoning is not strictly formal but always uses intuitions i e the a priori knowledge of space and time thanks to the progress of symbolic logic especially as treated by professor peano this part of the kantian philosophy is now capable of a final and irrevocable refutation by the help of ten principles of deduction and ten other premisses of a general logical nature e g impli cation is a relation all mathematics can be strictly and formally deduced the general doctrine that all mathematics is deduction by logical princi ples from logical principles was strongly advocated by leibniz but owing partly to a faulty logic partly to belief in the logical necessity of euclidean geometry he was led into hopeless errors in the endeavour to carry out in doing and showing 35 detail a view which in its general outline is now known to be correct the actual propositions of euclid for example do not follow from the principles of logic alone and the perception of this fact led kant to his innovations in the theory of knowledge but since the growth of non euclidean geometry it has appeared that pure mathematics has no concern with the question whether the axioms and propositions of euclid hold of actual space or not what pure mathematics asserts is merely that the euclidean proposi tions follow from the euclidean axioms i e it asserts an implication we assert always in mathematics that if a certain assertion p is true of any entity x or of any set of entities x y z then some other assertion q is true of those entities but we do not assert either p or q separately of our entities the above argument which is supposed to refute kant obviously begs the question from the outset russell takes it for granted that mathematics consists of deductions and his following remarks make it clear that by deduction russell means here a formal logical deduction i e a deduction of propositions from certain other propositions according to some general rules which are not specific for mathematics this assumption overtly contradicts what kant says about mathematics so the following argument only adds to this statement some additional details but doesn t justify it kant s crucial objection to the leibnizian view on mathematics to which russell adheres here is this from a formal point of view i e as far as only logical form of sentences is taken into consideration mathematics is no different from a mere speculation a speculative theory can be developed on an axiomatic basis just like a mathematical theory what makes the difference between mathematics and speculation is the fact that mathematics constructs its objects according to certain rules while speculation proceeds with concepts without being involved in any similar constructive activity the fact that the speculative thought may also posit some entities falling under these concepts from the kantian viewpoint does not constitute an objection because such stipulated entities doesn t qualify as objects in the kantian sense of the term behind an object there is a procedure governed by a certain rule that constructs this object while speculative entities are stipulated as mere things falling under some given description without any constructive procedure this is the reason why the pure mathematics is objective in the sense in which the pure speculation is not what makes the pure mathematics objective is the rule like character of object construction the formal logical consistency is a necessary but not sufficient condition for claiming that a given axiomatic theory is objectively valid russell s critique of kant in the principles of mathematics doesn t take into the account the kantian problem of separation of the pure mathematics from the pure speculation in this sense his approach is more traditional than kant s and from a kantian viewpoint qualifies as dogmatic like aristotle and leibniz russell provides his philosophy of mathematics with a metaphysical doctrine that he calls the logical atomism this is how he describes the relation of this doctrine to logic and mathematics in the introduction to his 33 36 andrei rodin as i have attempted to prove in the principles of mathematics when we analyse mathematics we bring it all back to logic it all comes back to logic in the strictest and most formal sense in the present lectures i shall try to set forth in a sort of outline rather briefly and rather unsatisfactorily a kind of logical doctrine which seems to me to result from the philosophy of mathematics not exactly logically but as what emerges as one reflects a certain kind of logical doctrine and on the basis of this a certain kind of metaphysic thus russell sees kant s work in the philosophy of mathematics as an attempt to fill logical gaps appearing when one tries to reconstruct euclid s geometry with aristotle s syllogistic logic which hardly correctly describes kant s own intention russell suggests two in dependent reasons why there are such gaps first because euclid s geometry is logically imperfect and second because aristotle s logic is not appropriate for doing mathematics however the new mathematics including non euclidean geometries and the new symbolic logic taken together according to russell wholly fix the problem making russell s leib nizian dream real what russell s the principles of mathematics aim at is made clear by the following lines that i take from the preface to this work the second volume in which i have had the great good fortune to secure the collaboration of mr a n whitehead will be addressed exclusively to mathematicians it will contain chains of deductions from the premisses of symbolic logic through arithmetic finite and infinite to geometry in an order similar to that adopted in the present volume it will also contain various original developments in which the method of professor peano as supplemented by the logic of relations has shown itself a powerful instrument of mathematical investigation the planned second volume of the principles of mathematics appeared later as a co authored independent three volume work 35 10 people who tried to push the kantian line without loosing its adequacy to the contem porary mathematics and without turning the kantian philosophy into an orthodoxy had indeed a hard time in the beginning of the 20 th century ernest cassirer published in 1907 a paper 5 on the issue of relationships between kantian philosophy and the new mathematics referring to russell s 1903 view and new formal logical methods under the name of logistics cassirer says 10 cf 23 p 7 8 from august 1900 until the completion of principia mathematica in 1910 russell was both a metaphysician and a working logician the two are completely intertwined in his work metaphysics was to provide the basis for logic logic and logicism were to be the basis for arguments for the metaphysics doing and showing 37 with this arises a problem which lies completely outside the scope of lo gistics worrying about the rules that govern the world of objects is com pletely left to direct observation which is the only one that can teach us whether we can find here certain regularities or a pure chaos logic and mathematics deal only with the order of concepts they don t contest the order or the disorder of objects and they don t need to confuse themselves with this issue the above quote presents an interesting modification of kant s original view following kant cassirer takes the issue of objethood seriously and continues to analyze it in kantian rather than fregean terms however unlike kant cassirer treats the objecthood is an external issue with respect to the pure mathematics saying that the pure mathematics just like formal logic deals only with the order of concepts thus he by and large accepts russell s view on mathematics and displaces the problem of obecthood elswhere namely into the sphere of application of mathematics to the sensual experience in particular within physics unlike russell cassirer doesn t try to reform mathematics but rather aims at describing it as a fact fact of science in hermann cohen s sense so what russell says about mathematics in 1903 cassirer takes to be an adequate description of the current state of affairs in mathematics rather than a project aiming at reforming this discipline 11 9 formal and informal bourbaki it must be stressed that during the first decade of the 20 th century things in mathematics and mathematical physics were changing so rapidly that no established pattern of doing mathematics and physics really existed at that time it was a period when older patterns were competing with new nascent patterns although today we are still facing rapid con ceptual changes the passed 20 th century provides us with a historical distance allowing one to revaluate critically what russell cassirer and other people who wrote about math ematics in 1900 ies as seen from the beginning of the 21 st century the situation appears to be the following russell s individual intellectual development from the neo kantian critical philosophy to the neo hegelean dialectical logicism to a leibniz style metaphysi cal logicism supported by the new symbolic logic 34 represents a significant trend in the philosophy of the 20 th century which became particularly influential within the part of anglo saxon philosophy that describes itself as analytic a mild form of logicism see 11 russell s logicism about mathematics is the claim according to which mathematics is wholly reducible to logic in the sense that mathematics needs no other first principles except logical principles a milder form of logicism about mathematics consists of the claim according to which first principles of mathematics contain logical principles plus some additional non logical axioms like axioms of zf historically such a mild logicism can be traced back at least to frege s view about geometry 11 some people may argue that such a view does not qualify as logicism at all nevertheless i shall use in this paper the term logicism in such a wider sense that covers both russell s strong logicism and the mild logicism just described what cassirer says about mathematics in the above quote in the main text does not commit him to the strong russell s logicism but it does commit him to the mild one 38 andrei rodin the last footnote became a dominant trend in the philosophy of mathematics in spite of the fact many if not most of working mathematicians beginning with poincare disagree with it most mathematicians resist it by saying that they are simply not interested in philosophical and foundational issues in their professional lives studies of formal axiomatic theories developed into an established field of mathematics but philosophical in particular metaphysical aspects of these studies are seen by the most of the mathematical commu nity as an alien element of the mathematical research like in kant s time and arguably even more than in kant s time today s mathematical community remains sensible to the difference between a mathematical argument and a philosophical speculation looking at patterns of today s mathematical reasoning one can not only recover the eu clidean scheme but also reaffirm kant s argument according to which the objective charac ter of mathematics depends on the way in which mathematics constructs its objects i shall demonstrate the relevance of this kantian view in two steps first by analyzing recent informal mathematics and then by analyzing an example of wholly formalized theory in both cases i shall use the example of bourbaki s volume on set theory the first volume of bourbaki s elements but consider two different editions of this work for the formalized part i shall use the usual english edition 2 and for the informal part i shall use a draft version of this volume found in the bourbaki s archive while the final published version of the text contains a purely formal treatment of set theory and aims at showing the possibility of a similar treatment of any other mathematical theory the draft presents set theory in an informal manner which quite accurately reflects the way in which this theory is used in the common mathematical practice except the set theory itself as explained the previous section let us begin with the draft 12 after a philosophical introduction that explains the notion of mathematical theory the author introduces informally the concept of fundamental set and the relation of mem bership between sets and their elements the author calls a set fundamental in order to distinguish a well defined set concept from a more general notion of collection then the author introduces with the usual informal notation the concept of subset which is the subject to the following axiom any predicate of type a defines a subset of a any subset of a can be defined through a predicate of type a predicate of type a is a predicate p such that for every element a of set a p a has a definite truth value the subset s of set a defined by p consists of such and only of such a for which p a is true next bourbaki introduces the concept of complement of a given subset of powerset p a of a given set a i e the set of all subsets of a of union intersection and cartesian 12 ele ments de la the orie des ensembles re daction 050 cote bki 01 1 4 available at mathdoc emath fr archives bourbaki pdf 050 iecnr 059 pdf doing and showing 39 product of sets described as operations on sets of relation and function between sets having these basic concepts in his disposal the author says in any mathematical theory one begins with a number of fundamental sets each of which consists of elements of a certain type that needs to be con sidered then on the basis of types that are already known one introduces new types of elements for example the subsets of a set of elements pairs of elements and for each of those new types of elements one introduces sets of elements of those types so one forms a family of sets constructed from the fundamental sets those constructions are the following 1 given set a which is already constructed take the set p a of the sub sets of a 2 given sets a b which are already constructed take the cartesian prod uct axb of these sets the sets of objects which are constructed in this way are introduced into a theory step by step when it is needed each proof involves only a finite number of sets we call such sets types of the given theory their infinite hierarchy constitutes a scale of types on this basis the author describes the concept of structure in the following way we begin with a number of fundamental sets a b c l that we call base sets to be given a structure on this base amounts to this 1 be given properties of elements of these sets 2 be given relations between elements of these sets 3 be given a number of types making part of the scale of types constructed on this base 4 be given relations between elements of certain types constructed on this base 5 assume as true a number of mutually consistent propositions about these properties and these relations what i want to stress is the fact that principles of building mathematical theory described in the bourbaki s draft are not so different from euclid s bourbaki like euclid begins with principles of building mathematical objects but not with axioms axioms in the modern sense of the term appear only in the very end of the above list the 5 th item while for euclid the basic data is a finite family of points and the rest of the geometrical universe is constructed from these points by postulates for bourbaki the basic data is a finite family of sets and the rest is constructed as just described while for euclid the basic type of geometrical object is a figure for bourbaki the basic type of mathematical object is a structure in both cases the constructed objects come with certain propositions that can be asserted about these objects without proofs because they immediately follow from corresponding definitions in both cases the construction of objects is a subject of certain rules but not the matter of a mere stipulation an infinite cyclic group to take a typical 40 andrei rodin example construed as a structure along the above lines qualifies as an object just like a regular triangle in euclid 13 remind however that we are talking so far about a draft but not about the finial published version of the bourbaki s volume on set theory the published formalized version of the above is drastically different here bourbaki proceeds as follows the first chapter of the treatise which has the title description of formal mathematics begins with an account of signs and assemblies strings of signs provided with a definition of mathematical theory according to which a theory contains rules which allow us to assert that certain assemblies of signs are terms or relations of the theory and other rules which allow us to assert that certain assemblies are theorems of the theory then follows a description of operations that allow for constructing new assemblies of signs from some given assemblies the simplest operation of this sort is the concatenation of two given assemblies a b into a new assembly ab on such a purely syntactic basis bourbaki introduces some logical concepts necessary for a formal axiomatic treatment of set theory although bourbaki s version of axiomatic set theory is not identical to zf it is similar in its character the differences between the two ways of formalizing set theory are not relevant to the present discussion and i leave them aside instead i shall stress differences and similarities between the informal bourbaki s draft on set theory and the published volume where set theory is treated formally in the published formalized theory unlike the theory found in the unpublished draft every basic set theoretic construction is represented as an assembly of signs string of symbols which informally speaking states as an axiom or proves that given certain sets there exist some other sets like in the case of pairing given sets x y there exist another set z x y that has x and y as its elements thus in the formal theory sets are no longer constructed in anything like kant s sense instead one assumes the existence of certain sets and using this assumption proves the existence of certain other sets this is of course a very general feature of the modern axiomatic method which i have already stressed above talking about modern formal representations of the euclid style geometrical reasoning hilbert and bernays 19 describe this difference between their own approach and euclid s approach in the following words euclid does not presuppose that points or lines constitute any fixed domain of individuals therefore he does not state any existence axioms either but only construction postulates however as a matter of fact bourbaki s formal set theory just like its informal prototype begins with certain basic constructions but not with axioms in that respect there is no essential difference between the formal and the informal approaches and the kantian view 13 in order to continue this analogy one may compare the notion of isomorphism of structures in bourbaki with euclid s notion of congruence of figures doing and showing 41 on mathematical objecthood applies equally well in both cases the difference is more specific and concerns the types of involved constructions while in the informal draft the relevant constructions are set theoretic subset complement powerset union intersection cartesian product etc in the published formalized version of the theory the relevant constructions are syntactic assembly of signs concatenation of assemblies substitution etc in order to understand this difference we need to discuss first the role of symbolism in mathematics 10 the role of symbolism the constructive aspect of formalization just stressed remains unrevealed in russell s logi cist philosophy of mathematics which uses the symbolic logic as a magic tool that helps to realize the leibnizian dream but doesn t explain what does it mean for logic to be symbolic hilbert and bernays in the introductory part of their 19 provide the following explanation of this issue first they remark that for developing the elementary arithmetics what we essentially need is only that the numeral 1 and the suffix 1 are intuitive objects which can be recognized unambiguously meaning that every natural number can be represented as a string of 1 s then they also briefly characterize the elementary conceptual viewpoint in algebra the objects of the theory are again certain figures namely the polynomials constructed with the help of the symbols and parentheses finally considering the formalization of calculus they say when the usual calculus is formalized i e when its presuppositions and inferences are translated into initial formulas and rules of deduction then a proof in calculus becomes a succession of intuitively comprehensible pro cesses then in principle we have the same situation as in our treatment of the elementary arithmetic hilbert and bernays talk here about mathematical objects and about their intuitive charac ter in the full accordance with kant the purpose of formalization in their understanding is not getting rid of objecthood and intuition in mathematics but rather a replacement of the problematic objecthood and the problematic intuitions of modern mathematics which involves non euclidean spaces infinite sets and the like by the apparently non problematic objecthood and intuition related to manipulations with finite strings of symbols according to some precisely specified rules let me now make another historical digression and remark that mathematics began to use symbolic means at a very early stage of its historical development the history of mathematical notation 3 provides in my view an appropriate context for considering the modern formal mathematics for this purpose i shall describe here briefly two historical examples and then use them for a further analysis of the hilbert style formalization 42 andrei rodin my first example is euclid s mathematical notation as we have seen euclid uses written means of three different types i the usual phonetic alphabetic writing by which he communicates his greek prose ii diagrams and iii a special alphabetical mathematical notation like in the case of abc used as a name of triangle this notation links i with ii in the following way a name like abc can be inserted into the greek prose and can be equally read of the corresponding diagram in this way this notation allows for referring to the diagram in the prose this notation remains today in use in the school geometry although euclid uses it systematically both in geometrical and in arithmetical books of his elements in the following discussion i leave here euclid s arithmetic aside 14 euclid s geometrical notation has an implicit syntax that makes this notation appropriate for its purpose in particular it fits euclid s rules about constructing geometrical objects constructing the name ab from the names a and b mimics drawing the segment of straight line ab between the given points a and b the convention according to which names ab and ba always refer to the same straight line reflects the assumption according to which drawing a straight line from a to b and drawing a straight line from b to a always brings the same result this syntax extends to names for polygons as follows every two letter segment of the name of a given polygon is the name of a side of this polygon by concatenating the first and the last letter of the name of the polygon one also gets the name of a side of this polygon this convention and the assumption according to which a polygon is uniquely determined by its sides imply that a cyclic permutation of the letters in a name of polygon remains the referent of this name invariant for example if word abc names a triangle than word cba names the same triangle another important correspondence between syntactic rules and constructive rules in euclid concerns the sum and the difference of numbers and magnitudes that is implicitly defined by axioms 2 and 3 of the elements in particular these operations make sense for straight lines albeit they are not defined for any pair of straight lines consider two straight lines ab and bc such that point b lies on ac in this case the sum of ab and bc is well defined and ab bc ac summing up of ab and bc is of course a geometrical rather than syntactic operation it takes two geometrical objects and produces out of them a new object but it is mimicked on the syntactic level through the following obvious rule given two names uv and xy such that v x contract them and get new name uy although such a syntactic contraction does not fully reflects the corresponding geometrical operation in particular it doesn t allow one to see whether or not the corresponding 14 i although the early mss of euclid s elements contain no diagram there is good reason to believe that euclid and other greek mathematicians did use diagrams in their practice most probably by drawing them on a specially prepared sand 29 ii it is sometimes said that in the arithmetical books of the elements euclid represents numbers by geometrical straight lines this in my view is not accurate indeed euclid represents straight lines and numbers by diagrams of the same type and he uses in both cases the same notation it doesn t follow that he represents numbers by straight lines any mathematical diagram and any mathematical notation requires a convention what the given diagram and the given notation represent the same drawings and the same symbolic expression may represent in mathematics very different things doing and showing 43 geometrical operation is well defined it makes the syntax convenient for dealing with this geometrical operation the next historical example is suggested by hilbert and bernays reference to the elemen tary algebra in the above quote in the 17 th century descartes and his followers established a new symbolic algebraic notation which is still in use in only slightly modified form in the elementary school algebra and which is in many respects similar to the notation used in the modern abstract algebra the new notation had a tremendous effect on mathe matics recently described by serfati 36 a symbolic revolution the symbolic calculus known today as the elementary algebra in the 17 th century was understood by a number of influential writers as a general science of magnitude the relevant notion of magnitude gen eralized upon natural numbers and geometrical magnitudes known from euclid and other traditional sources consider the following interesting passage from arnauld 1 what cannot be multiplied by its nature can be multiplied through a mental fiction where the truth presents itself as certainly as in a real multiplication in order to learn the distance covered during 10 hours by one who covers 24 lieu per 8 hours i multiply through a mental fiction 10 hours by 24 lieu that gives me the imaginary product of 240 hour times lieu which i divide then by 8 hours and get 30 lieu by the same mental fiction one multiplies a surface by another surface even if the product has 4 dimensions and cannot exist in nature one may discover many truths through multiplications of this sort people say that this is because the imaginary products can be reduced to lines but there is no evidence that relevant proofs depend on those lines which are in fact wholly alien to them p 38 39 traditionally the product of two straight lines is construed as a rectangle having these given lines as its sides the product of three lines is a solid but in order to form products of four and more linear factors in this geometrical way one needs higher dimensions which according to arnauld cannot exist in nature nevertheless he is ready to consider such higher dimensional geometrical constructions as useful fictions on equal footing with products of distances by time intervals which don t have any immediate physical interpretation either but are demonstratively useful for calculations in the last quoted paragraph arnauld refers to descartes proposal to construct the multiplication of geometrical magnitudes differently so the product of straight lines is again a straight line in modern words descartes definition of multiplication of straight lines makes this operation algebraically closed descartes uses an auxiliary line 1 as a unit and then considers similar triangles with sides 1 a b c such that 1 a b c which gives him the wanted definition of c ab see 7 arnauld finds this trick artificial and unnecessary what makes him confident about higher dimensional geometrical products and quasi physical units like hour times lieu is the symbolic algebraic calculus to which these problematics notions are associated within this calculus the product of four factors p abcd behaves like a product of two or three factors one cannot easily imagine the product of two surfaces just like one cannot give a physical sense to 44 andrei rodin hours times lieu but one can easily concatenate the string ab and the string cd and think of this operation as multiplication of two surfaces descartes alternative definition of the geometrical product aims at providing a clear and distinct intuitive underpinning of this operation that avoids the talk of higher dimensions arnauld finds descartes construction of product unnecessary because in his eyes the symbolic calculus provides such an intuitive underpinning by itself the proofs that arnauld mentions in this context are nothing but symbolic calculations it is instructive to compare arnauld s treatment of algebra with the following kant s remark about this subject m athematics does not merely construct magnitudes quanta as in ge ometry but also mere magnitudes quantitatem as in algebra where it entirely abstracts from the constitution of the object that is to be thought in accordance with such a concept of magnitude in this case it chooses a certain notation for all construction of magnitudes in general and thereby achieves by a symbolic construction equally well what geometry does by an ostensive or geometrical construction of objects themselves which discursive cognition could never achieve by means of mere concepts 25 a 717 in this quote kant presents a view on the elementary symbolic algebra which can be called formal in the modern rather than in kant s proper sense of the term according to this view true objects of symbolic algebra are symbolic constructions which represent mere magnitudes or pure magnitudes just like constructed geometrical triangles represent the general concept of triangle from the intuitive point of view such symbolic constructions are at least as clear and distinct as traditional geometrical constructions and arguably are even more clear and more distinct in a sense these symbolic constructions are even more concrete than traditional geometrical constructions as hilbert and bernays tell us in the above quote such symbolic construction are as much concrete as a representation of natural number n by n vertical bars at the same time mathematical concepts represented by these symbolic constructions are more general and more abstract than traditional geometrical concepts those are concepts of abstract magnitudes rather than concepts of circle triangle and similar familiar things such a formal understanding of algebra is apparently not alien to arnauld either as far as algebraic calculations are concerned he readily relies on symbolic procedures and finds it unnecessary to justify these procedures by any geometrical considerations yet arnauld s words as well as commonly known facts of the history of mathematics of the last three centuries make it clear that the purely formal view on the symbolic algebra does not fully express the significance of this mathematical discipline another part of the truth is that the symbolic algebraic constructions allow for multiple geometrical and arithmetical inter pretations and moreover may motivate the development of new geometrical and arithmetic concepts like that of higher dimensional space or that of complex number this feature of the symbolic algebra of the 17 th century allowed descartes and his follows to apply the new algebra to geometry which gave rise to what we call today analytic geometry the doing and showing 45 dialectical interplay between the abstract algebra on the one hand and geometry and arithmetic on the other hand still remains one of the most important driving forces of the mathematical progress think of recent achievements in the algebraic geometry this shows that the contentual aspect of symbolic algebra has been at least as much important throughout the long history of this discipline as its formal aspect both euclid s geometrical notation and the symbolic algebraic notation represent math ematical operations and mathematical constructions by certain operations with symbols and certain symbolic constructions the algebraic notation does this of course in a more systematic way which makes possible a purely formal reading of this notation the proto syntax of euclid s notation makes this notation convenient but doesn t allow one to use this notation without diagrams except very simple cases let us now look more precisely at the analogy between the elementary symbolic algebra and symbolic formal calculi suggested by hilbert and bernays in the above quote at the first glance the analogy seems to be precise in both cases we have symbolic constructions provided with precise syntactic rules on the one hand and some problematic reasoning involving confusing intuitions higher geometrical dimensions imaginary magnitudes infinite sets etc on the other hand in both cases the symbolic constructions and the associated syntax is used for clarifying the problematic reasoning in both cases a formal approach is appropriate no matter how one imagines 4 dimensional objects quasi physical units like hours times lieu and infinite sets one knows how to manipulate with these things using symbols and precise rules of manipulation with these symbols so as long as 4 dimensional objects quasi physical units and infinite sets are represented by symbols in an appropriate symbolic calculus one is on a secure ground provided of course that the calculus itself is secure 15 as it is well known the symbolic calculi appropriate for the purpose turned to be generally less secure than hilbert and his followers hoped for i would like however to stress a very different aspect of the problem by pointing on a disanalogy between the symbolic algebra on the one hand and the symbolic calculi used for formalization of mathematics on the other hand as we have seen the symbolic algebra represents certain problematic geometrical constructions like the product of two surfaces by simple symbolic constructions like the concatenation of strings ab and cd the informal set theoretic notation like one used in the bourbaki s draft works similarly it helps to represent set theoretic constructions with certain symbolic constructions as in the case when the set of four elements a b c d is 15 compare what maclaurin says about the usefulness of algebra in his theory of fluxions the improvement that have been made by it the doctrine of fluxions are in a great measure owing to a facility conciseness and great extend of the method of computation or algebraic part it is for the sake of these advantages that so many symbols are emplyed in algebra it algebra may have been employed to cover under a complication of symbols obstruse doctrines that could not bear the light so well in a plain geometrical form but without doubt obscurity may be avoided in this art as well as in geometry by defining clearly the import and use of the symbols and proceeding with care afterwards a treatise of fluxions quoted by 3 v 2 p 330 46 andrei rodin denoted as a b c d however the properly formal syntax like one used in the bourbaki s published volume on set theory or in zf works quite differently in this case symbolic constructions represent not set theoretic constructions but inferences of some propositions from some other propositions as we have already seen the hilbert style formal approach to set theory assumes that in mathematics albeit not in the meta mathematics the talk of construction can be safely replaced by the talk of existence thus within a hilbert style formal logical framework syntactic manipulations with symbols no longer represent manipulations with mathematical objects as this is done in the symbolic algebra where manipulations with symbols represent manipulations with geometrical and arithmetical objects or with pure magnitudes but rather represent manipulations with propositions which under the intended interpretation tell us something about certain mathematical objects in particular syntactic operations described in the beginning of the bourbaki s volume on set theory do not represent set theoretic operations informally described in the bourbaki s draft i claim that this feature of the hilbert style formal axiomatic method makes this method inappropriate for doing mathematics and i hold it responsible for the enduring gap be tween the formal and the informal mathematics exemplified by the two burbaki s texts discussed above this is in my view a reason why the formalization of mathematics so far did not have an effect comparable with the symbolic revolution of the 17 th century but isolated itself within a specific field of research called by its proponents foundations of mathematics in spite of the fact that most of working mathematicians pay little interest to this research and don t use its results in their work examples from today s mainstream informal mathematics strongly suggest that mathematics did not change its nature from euclid s times so radically that the object building eventually became a non issue and was replaced by a purely speculative stipulation of abstract entities with some desired prop erties relations today s mathematics just like greek mathematics constructs its objects like groups topological spaces toposes and whatnot just like greek mathematics today s mathematics constructs its objects following certain rules some of which apply across the whole of mathematics and some of which are specific for a given mathematical discipline just like greek mathematics today s mathematics involves doing and showing but not just showing and proving true informal constructive rules used in the contemporary math ematics in many cases call for more precise specifications i can see no general reason why such more precise specifications cannot be given but must be replaced by appropriate existential propositions if we now look more precisely where exactly lies the problem we can see that it has to do with the common informal notion of axiomatic theory discussed in the first part of this paper but doesn t concern more specific and more technical features of the modern axiomatic method doing and showing 47 11 mathematical constructivism in spite of the dominant position of weakly logicist approaches to mathematics during the most of the 20 th century the kantian view according to which mathematics should con struct its object rather than just stipulate them was never wholly forgotten and motivated a significant amount of mathematical and philosophical work that constitutes a trend in mathematics and its philosophy called constructivism this is a rather diverse movement that i shall not purport to describe here in detail for a concise review of the mathematical constructivism of the late 19 th and the 20 th century which however doesn t cover recent developments and further references see 38 here i provide only few remarks about it which are relevant to my purpose rather unfortunately in my view the constructivist movement from the very beginning took a conservative bend and began a fight against then new ways of mathematical think ing including the set theoretic thinking this tendency can be traced back to kronecker who required every well formed mathematical object to be constructible from natural num bers famously saying that only natural numbers are god s creation while everything else in mathematics is a human handicraft and on this basis didn t admit infinite sets more recently bishop was inspired by similar ideas and in particular by kronecker s works brouwer s intuitionism which qualifies as a form of constructivism also put rather severe restrictions on his contemporary mathematics as well as on essential parts of earlier estab lished mathematical results even those constructivists who like markov tried to develop constructive mathematics as a special part of mathematics rather than reform mathemat ics as a whole understood the notion of mathematical construction very restrictively and almost exclusively in computational terms since in this paper i also push the kantian line and stress the significance of constructions and objecthood in mathematics my present view also qualifies as constructivist however the target of my constructivist critique is not some particular mathematical notion like that of infinite set of the countable or a higher cardinality that may look suspicious from a constructive point of view but the modern axiomatic method itself i claim that a mathematical theory needs explicitly given constructive rules which cannot be generally reduced to rules of logical inference whether the inference is treated formally or not i make so far no judgement as to which sorts of constructions are admissible and which are not as long as we are talking now about a constructive method of theory building in general the discussion about particular ways of constructing mathematical objects is inap propriate just like the discussion on particular axioms is inappropriate when one discusses generalities concerning the axiomatic method the kroneckerian belief that only arith metical constructions are real is not very unlike the belief that only figures constructible by ruler and compass are real any constructive thinking in and about mathematics must definitely avoid such a dogmatic attitude just like hilbert s axiomatic thinking avoids the dogmatic attitude towards particular axioms and focuses instead on questions concerning the relative consistency of axioms and the like 48 andrei rodin the example of euclid s elements shows how a perfectly constructive theory can be built in a systematic manner as we have seen this theory is not built as an axiomatic theory in the modern sense of the word the main difference is that euclid s theory includes such non propositional constructive principles as postulates i claim that such non propositional constructive principles are needed in modern mathematical theories too the idea that constructive postulates in a formal axiomatic can be always replaced by existential axioms may look innocent but it is not let s see again what is gained and what is lost with such a replacement leaving now aside metaphysical issues about being and becoming in such a propositional setting the problem of constructibility of object o on the basis of a given set of postulates p reduces to the problem of provability of certain existential proposition e that says that o exists from a set of assumptions a that includes axioms of the given theory and eventually some additional hypotheses in other words one should provide proof b that uses assumptions a and brings e as a conclusion since in a formal setting b is itself a syntactic construction one thus reduces the question of constructibility of o to the question of constructibility of b the constructibility of b of course depends of logical rules of inference r which are used in the given axiomatic setting beware that r and p are sets of rules but not sets of propositions now if object o and postulates p are described only informally like in the euclid s ele ments or in the bourbaki s draft mentioned above one may argue that the reformulation of the constructibility problem in terms of formal proof b makes sense because the syn tactic object b is simpler than o and that rules r are more precise and better determined than rules p simpler and better determined basically means that b and r has a finitary combinatorial nature however such a reduction of one constructibility question to another constructibility question which is better posed and admits a more precise an swer is also achieved by a somewhat similar but still a different means namely by the use of symbolic algebra and at least as far as the question of constructibility by ruler and compass is concerned the use of symbolic algebra proves more effective than the use of symbolic logic because algebraic symbolic constructions mimic geometrical constructions in a sense in which symbolic constructions of a formal counterpart of euclid s geometry do not 16 the principle reason why one may be not satisfied with the algebraic solution lies beyond the issue of constructibility as such one may argue that even if the informal symbolic al gebra indeed clarifies the issue of geometrical constructibility it leaves imprecise the general logical structure of the argument a formal axiomatic approach aims at reducing the whole 16 see tarski s classics 37 where the author considers several possible axiomatizations of euclidean geometry and study their meta theoretical properties a relevant axiomatic theory which takes into ac count euclid s constructibility by ruler and compass turns to be both incomplete in the sense that some propositions formulated in the language of this theory are true in certain models of the theory but false in other models and not decidable there exist no general procedure for proving or disproving propositions formulated in the language of this theory so at least in this particular case the reduction of informal mathematical constructions to formal symbolic constructions doesn t help one to answer questions about constructibility of particular objects in the original theory doing and showing 49 argument and not just the part of the argument that involves object construction to some sort of symbolic calculation this is why the kantian distinctions between the logic of concepts i e formal logic in kant s sense and the logic of intuitive representations of these concepts or otherwise the logic of corresponding objects transcendental logic does not make much sense in the context of formal theories on the one hand a formal proof in the modern sense of formal can be seen as an argument based on certain assump tions and applying certain logical rules i e as a formal proof in kant s sense one the other hand it can be seen as an intuitively transparent symbolic construction which is a subject to precise constructing rules that can be described in terms of transcendental logic strictly speaking none of these two readings is relevant because in the given context the very difference between construction and calculation on the one hand and purely concep tual non objectual reasoning on the other hand wholly disappears this seems me to be the core of the neo leibnizian project in foundations of mathematics of the 20 th century which purports to replace the kantian critical approach its description along the above lines is found in 4 this idea may look indeed very modern in spite of its quasi traditional metaphysical aspect that i stressed in the previous section and very radical against the kantian back ground there are however two reasons why i believe that it is fundamentally flawed and and must be rather abandoned the first reason is practical a century is a sufficient historical laps for judging whether a particular project of reforming mathematics has been successful or not an analysis of the current mathematical practice suggests that the project of reforming mathematics along the neo leibnizian lines has not be successful working mathematicians still distinguish between objects that they construct and mathematical facts about these objects that they formulate and prove noticeably this concerns both the mainstream informal mathematics and studies in formal logic and related areas in the informal mathematics people widely apply various forms of constructions and calculations but they also show how and why these constructions and these calculations are relevant to their arguments in the formal mathematics people do the same but focus their research on the specific case of symbolic constructions and specific symbolic calculations called logical in the formal mathematics just like in the informal one people not only calculate but also reason about what they calculate thus neither the formal nor the informal mathematics provides an evidence of the neo leibnizian fusion of reasoning with calculation true mathematical proofs in some cases reduce to calculations however such a reduction always makes part of a given proof so this fact does not count as an evidence of the neo lebnizian fusion although there is always a space for arguing that the current mathematical practice is ill founded and needs to be reformed i believe that the feedback from practice to theory is essential this is why i take the above practical argument seriously and am not ready to devaluate it as merely pragmatic the second reason is theoretical and it lies beyond the pure mathematics itself it needs a special discussion 50 andrei rodin 12 galilean science and unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics it is hardly controversial that mathematics deals with forms of possible human experi ence in its simplest and most general form this claim is simply tantamount to saying that mathematics applies across a wide range of human practices today this is even more true than it was in kant s time crucial technologies on which depend our well being in many ways depend on mathematical considerations and cannot be sustained and further devel oped without mathematical expertise mathematics today makes part of any engineering education in kant s time the only properly mathematized science was newtonian me chanics the following progress of science in the 19 th century has brought us to the point when every physical theory deserving the name has a mathematical aspect today physics and chemistry are mathematized and the mathematization of biology is in progress using mathematical models also becomes an usual practice in social sciences let me now be more specific and ask which general forms of experience are relevant to today s science and technology this question is obviously yet too large and too general to be answered in any detail here i would like however to stress only the following point at least since galileo s times science practices an active intervention of humans into the nature through experiments rather than a passive observation and description of the observed phenomena so we are talking now about the mathematically laden science where mathematics serves for guiding human interactions with the environment rather than simply for describing how this environment appears to our senses as van fraassen 10 puts this the real importance of theory to the working scientist is that it is a factor in experimental design p 73 thus mathematical forms of possible experience relevant to the modern galilean science are forms of such possible interactions with the environment rather than only linguistic and logical forms that allow for spelling out some plausible hypotheses about the world and deriving from them some consequences according to certain rules the forms of the latter kind may be sufficient for developing a speculative science along the older scholastic pattern but they are certainly not sufficient for developing the modern mathematically laden science and the modern mathematically laden technology as far as the pure mathematics is conceived as a domain of abstract logical possibilities the fact that mathematics proves unreasonably effective 39 in its applications to empirical sciences and technology remains a complete mystery the mystery is dissolved as soon as one observes that mathematics explores not everything that can possibly be the case which is a hardly observable domain unless one delimit the sense of possibly in one way or another but rather what we can possibly do within the limits of our human capacities which are steadily growing with the progress of science and technology what are these limits is a tricky question on the one hand mathematics systematically ignores certain apparent limits by exaggerating relevant capacities this is usually called the mathematical idealization for example mathematicians pretend that they can count up to 1010 10 just as easily as up to 10 or that they can draw a straight line between two stars just as doing and showing 51 easily as they can draw a line between two points marked on a sheet of paper this strategy usually works until the point where the empirical constraints become pressing and people invent new mathematics that takes these constraints into account as this for example happened when people realized that the old good euclidean geometry is not appropriate for describing the physical space at large astronomical scales in spite of the fact that it still works amazingly well at the scale of a planetary system like ours one the other hand it also happens that in a real experiment people observe what in terms of the assumed mathematical description of the given experiment qualifies as impossible as this happened in the michelson morley experiment supposed to measure parameters of the ether flow around the earth in such cases people say that the assumed mathematical description and hence the corresponding physical theory is wrong and look for a new one sometimes the suitable mathematics can be found in a nearly ready made form and only used for building a new physical theory but sometimes in order to fix the problem one needs to develop the appropriate mathematics from the outset as this happened in the history of the electro magnetism for example this picture suggests the view on the pure mathematics as a proper part of the galilean science however complicated the dialectic of interaction between the purely mathematical part and the pure empirical part of the galilean science may be in fact these parts hardly exist in pure states there is nothing unreasonable in it on the contrary this dialectics shows us how exactly the galilean scientific reason works russell s neo leibnizian logicism about mathematics promises nothing more and nothing less than that to make mathematics a part of logic so that any mathematical form of possible experience turns into the form of a proposition and forms of logical inference of propositions from some other propositions which may eventually refer to some experience russell s view is quite radical in this respect and many people including hilbert who were directly involved into reforming mathematics on the basis of new logic in the beginning of the 20 th century didn t share russell s philosophical views anyway as i have already argued a weaker form of the neo leibnizian approach that i call the weak logicism in order to distiguish it from russell s radical logicism is intrinsic to the formal axiomatic method in hilbert s sense of the term which nowadays has became standard even if forms of possible experience delivered by a formal axiomatic theory do not qualify as logical forms in the precise sense of the term they are still can be described as forms of possible empirical propositions rather than forms of empirical interactions or anything else as far as we want to continue to develop the galilean science and the technology connected to this type of science our mathematics must provide for it forms of possible empirical interaction rather than just forms of propositions in other words it must provide forms appropriate doing various things in the world but not only forms for talking about this world since formalized mathematical theories are not appropriate for this job we need to learn how to build mathematical theories differently 17 17 in certain situations one is in a position of doing things by saying some other things for example by giving orders to other people physical theories allow for a similar control over natural phenomena which 52 andrei rodin as kant shows in great detail the traditional geometry and his contemporary algebra are useful in the galilean science because these mathematical theories are constructive in the sense that they involve rules for constructing their objects explicitly or implicitly today we can hardly hope of course to get a new mathematical theory that would allow for identifying a physical object with a mathematical object in the same way in which one may identify modulo the mathematical idealization say a planet with an euclidean sphere today people doing particle physics describe particles using the mathematical group theory and manipulating with particles in experiments using a special hi tech equipment they don t expect that mathematical manipulations with groups would map their experimental manipulations in a direct way nevertheless the constructive character of the mainstream informal mathematical practice which i have stressed earlier in this paper still helps physicists and other scientists to design their experiments and their equipments scientists make up mathematical models of their experimental systems identifying modulo the usual mathematical idealization their experimental systems with the models of these systems then manipulate both with the models theoretically and with the experimental systems in real experiments and see whether the manipulations of both sorts work coherently this is of course an oversimplified picture of the scientific experiment for more details see 10 but it is sufficient for seeing that the possibility to establish a correlation between mathematical manipulations on the one hand and experimental manipulations on the other hand remains essential for today s mathematically laden experimental science such a correlation cannot be possibly established when the only type of mathematical objects available for manipulation are syntactic objects i don t want to say that ma nipulations with syntactic objects cannot be useful in physical experiments in fact they can but claim that the gap between syntactic manipulations and physical experimental manipulations needs to be filled by manipulations with mathematical objects like groups and whatnot the hilbert style formalized mathematics cannot provide this because it disqualifies the notion of manipulation with mathematical objects as naive and ill founded and allows only for manipulations with syntactic symbolic constructions within such a formal approach one is allowed to say and proof various things about mathematical objects but not allowed to touch these objects and moreover to manipulate with them even if it is possible to develop some sort of sterile mathematics within such a restrictive setting such mathematics would be useless in the modern empirical science and moreover in the modern technology this shows that the constructive aspect of mathematics in the relevant sense of con structive explained above is indeed essential it must be taken taken into account by any useful method of theory building applicable in mathematics mathematics certainly needs formal languages and logical rules applicable to propositions expressed in these languages is the basis of the modern science based technology however just like in the case of human society such a control cannot be established only by words and requires controlling mechanisms of different sorts the idea that such a control has been already established for us in advance by an external agency so that the mysteries of the world disclose themselves as soon as one finds right words for talking about them belongs to magic rather than science doing and showing 53 but it also needs rules of a different sort namely rules that regulate constructions of and operations with non syntactical mathematical objects just like logical rules such construc tive non logical rules can be described syntactically as rules about transformation of some symbolic constructions into some other symbolic constructions so what i have in mind is a development of the modern axiomatic method rather than its complete replacement by something else i believe that the example of euclid s elements which inspired hilbert about a century ago
