extension of the lambek calculus l 1 with empty antecedents allowed in sequents l 1 can be said to be the logic of concatenation while d can be said to be the logic of concatenation and intercalation in many senses it can be claimed that d mimics l 1 in that the proof theory generative capacity and complexity of the former calculus are natural extensions of the latter calculus in this paper we strengthen this claim we present the appropriate classes of models for d and prove some completeness results strikingly we see that these results and proofs are natural extensions of the corresponding ones for l 1 1 introduction the displacement calculus d is a quite well studied extension of the lambek calculus l 1 with empty antecedents allowed in sequents in many papers see 9 12 and 11 d has proved to provide elegant accounts of a variety of lin guistic phenomena of english and of dutch namely a processing interpretation of the so called dutch cross serial dependencies the hypersequent format hd 1 of displacement calculus is a pure sequent cal culus free of structural rules which subsumes the sequent calculus for l 1 the cut elimination algorithm for hd provided in 12 mimics the one of lambek s 5 syntactic calculus with some minor differences concerning the possibility of empty antecedents like l 1 d enjoys some nice properties such as the sub formula property decidablity the finite reading property and the focalisation property 7 like l 1 d is known to be np complete 6 concerning weak generative capacity d recognises the class of well nested multiple context free languages 13 in this respect the result on generative capacity generalises the result that states that l 1 recognises the class of context free languages one point of divergence in terms of generative capacity is that d recognises the class of the permutation closures of context free languages 10 finally it is important to note that a pentus like upper bound theorem for d is not known in this paper we present natural classes of models for d several strong completeness results are proved in particular strong completeness w r t the class research partially supported by sgr 2014 890 macda of the

algebras a natural extension of residuated monoids powerset frames for l 1 are of interest from the linguistic point of view because of their relation to language models powerset residuated displacement algebras over displacement algebras are given which generalise the powerset residuated monoids over monoids as well as over free monoids strong completeness results for the so called implicative fragment of d which is very relevant linguistically is proved in the spirit of buszkowski 2 but the construction is more subtle the structure of the paper is as follows in section 2 we present the basic proof theoretic tools useful for the construction of canonical models which we shall employ for the study of d from a semantic point of view in section 3 we provide the proof of two strong completeness of what we call the implicative fragment w r t powerset das over standard das with a countably infinite set of generators and l models respectively 2 the categorical calculus cd and the hypersequent calculus hd d is model theoretically motivated and the key to its conception is the use of many sorted universal algebra 3 namely sorted universal algebra here we assume a version of many sorted algebra such that the sort domains of an sorted algebra a are non empty with this condition we avoid some pathologies which arise in a na ve version of many sorted universal algebra cf 3 and 4 some definitions are needed let m m 0 1 be a free monoid where 1 is a distinguished element of the set of generators x of m we call such an algebra a separated monoid given an element a m we can associate to it a number called its sort as follows 1 s 1 1 s a 0 if a x and a 6 1 s w 1 w 2 s w 1 s w 2 this induction is well defined since m is free and 1 is a distinguished generator the sort function s in a separated monoid simply counts the number of separators an element contains definition 1 sort domains where m m 0 1 is a separated monoid the sort domains m i of sort i are defined as follows m i a m s a i i 0 it is readily seen that for every i j 0 m i m j iff i 6 j definition 2 standard displacement algebra the standard displacement algebra or standard da defined by a separated

the sorted op erations in definition 2 are defined by mutual recursion in figure 1 we let tp i 0 tpi a subset b of m is called a same sort subset iff there exists an i such that for every a b s a i d

case of l 1 the natural class of algebras is the class of residuated monoids rm in the case of d the natural class of algebras is the class of residuated displacement algebras residuated das rd one can restrict the definition of the sorted types let c be a subset of the connectives considered in the definition of types in figure 1 we define tp c as the least set of sorted types generated by pr and the set of connectives c if the context is clear we will write tp instead of tp c let us define the formal definition of a model a model m a v comprises a residuated d algebra and a sorted mapping v pr tp c called a valuation the mapping v is the unique function which extends v and which is such that v a b v a v b if is a binary connective of c and v a v a if is a unary connective of c finally a 0 ary connective is mapped into the corresponding unit of a needless to say the mappings v and v preserve the sorting regime let us see that d with all the connectives is strongly complete w r t rd soundness is trivial because we are considering the categorical calculus cd for models for the displacement calculus 5 continuous associativity x y z x y z discontinuous associativity x i y j z x i y

cd is strongly complete w r t rd the canonical model is l v where l is tp i i 0 i i 0 i i 0 i j where the interpretation of the new symbols is as expected let r be the equivalence relation on tp defined as follows a rb iff r cd a b and r cd b a where r is a set of non logical axioms using the usual tonicity properties for the connectives of tp one proves that r is a congruence where a is a type a is an element of tp r i e tp modulo r we define a b iff r cd a b we define the valuation v as v p p p is a primitive type we have that for every type a v a a finally one has that l v a b iff r cd a b from this we infer the following theorem theorem 1 the calculus cd is strongly complete w r t rd since da is a variety 2 see figure 3 it is closed by subalgebras direct products and homomorphic images which give additional das we have other interesting examples of das for instance the powerset da over a a i i 0 0 1 which we denote p a we have 4 p a p a i i 0 i j the notation of the carrier set of p a presupposes that its members are same sort subsets notice that vacuously satisfies the same sort condition where a b and c denote same sort subsets of a the operations i j and i are defined as follows 2 the term equational class is sometimes used in the literature 6 oriol valent n 5 i 0 j 1 a b a b a a and b b a ib a i b a a and b b it is readily seen that for every a p a is in fact a da notice that every sort domain p a i is a collection of same sort subsets that the sort domains of p a are non empty but no longer satisfy that p a i p a j iff i 6 j since the empty set p a i for every

for every a a d a b b ia d for every a a d i a b a ib d for every a a a i d b the class of powerset residuated das over a da is denoted prdd the class of powerset residuated das over a standard da is denoted prsd finally the subclass of prsd which is formed by powerset residuated algebras over finitely generated standard da are known simply as l models every standard da a has two remarkable properties namely the property that sort domains a i for i 0 can be defined in terms of a 0 and the property that every element a of a sort domain a i is decomposed uniquely around the separator 1 8 s 1 for i 0 a i a 0 1 1 a 0 i 1 1 s s 2 for i 0 if a 0 1 1 ai b 0 1 1 bi then ak bk for 0 k i standard das as their name suggests are particular cases of general das lemma 1 the class of standard das is a subclass of the class of das 3 proof we define a useful notation which will help us to prove the lemma where a a i i 0 0 1 is a standard da let a be an arbitrary element of sort s a we associate to every a a a sequence of elements a 0 as a we have the following vectorial notation 9 a ji ai if i j a j 1 i 1 aj if j i 0 since a is a standard da the ai associated to a given a are unique by freeness of the underlying monoid we have that a a s a 0 and we write a in place of a s a 0 consider arbitrary elements a b and c of a 3 later we see that the inclusion is proper models for the displacement calculus 7 continuous associativity is obvious discontinuous associativity let i j be such that i j i s a 1 b j c b i 10 c b s b i therefore a i b j c a i 10 b j 1 0 c b s b j a s a i on the other hand we have that a i b a i 10 b a s a i a i 10 b j 1 0 1 i j 1 th separator b s b j a s a i it follows that a i b i j 1 c a i 10 b j 1 0 c b s b j a s a i by comparing the right hand side of and we have therefore a i b j c a i b i j 1 c mixed permutation consider a i b j c and suppose that i s b 1 j a i b a i 10 b a j s b i j s b s b 1 j 1 separators 1 a s a j s b 1 it follows that a i b j c a i 10 b a j s b i c a s a j s b 1 since i s b 1 j then i j s b 1 then we have that a j s b 1 c a i 10 1 a j s b i c a s a j s b 1 it follows that a j s b 1 c i b a i 10 b a j s b i c a s a j s b 1 by comparing the right hand side of and we have therefore a i b j c a j s b 1 c i b mixed associativity there are two cases i s a or i s a considering the first one this is true for a b c a i 10 1 a s a i i c a i 10 c a s a i b a i c b the other case corresponding to i s a is completely similar the case corresponding to the units is completely trivial 8 oriol valent n 2 2 the hypersequent calculus hd we will now consider the string based hypersequent syntax from 8 the reason for using the prefix hyper in the term sequent is that the data structure used in hypersequent antecedents is quite nonstandard a fundamental tool to build the data structure of a sequent calculus for d is the notion of type segment for any type of sort 0 seg a a if s a 0 then seg a 0 a s a a we call seg a the set of type segments of a if c is a set of connectives we can now define the set of type segments corresponding to the set tp c of types generated by the connectives c as seg c a tp c seg a type segments of sort 0 are types but type segments of sort greater than 0 are no longer types strings of type segments can form meaningful logical material like the set of configurations which we now define where c is a set of connectives the configurations o c are defined in bnf unambiguously by mutual recursion as follows where is the empty string and 1 is the metalinguistic separator 10 o c o c 1 o c o c a o c for s a 0 o c 0 a o c 1 a s a 1 a o c s a as a o c for s a 0 the intuitive semantic interpretation of the last clause from 10 consists of elements 0 1 1 n 1 n n where 0 1 1 n 1 1 n jak and 1 n are the interpretations of the intercalated configurations if the context is clear we will write o for o c and likewise tp and seg the syntax in which o has been defined is called string based hypersequent syntax an equivalent syntax foro is called tree based hypersequent syntax which was defined in 9 12 for proof search and human readability the tree based notation is more convenient than the string based notation but for semantic pur poses the string based notation turns out to be very useful since the canonical model construction considered in section 3 relies on the set of type segments in string based notation the figure a of a type a is defined as follows 11 a a if s a 0 0 a 1 1 a s a 1 a 1 s a a if s a 0 the sort of a configuration is the number of metalinguistic separators it contains we have o i 0 oi where oi is the set of configurations of sort i we define a more general notion of configuration namely preconfiguration if v denotes seg c 1 a preconfiguration is simply a word of v obviously we have that o v a preconfiguration is proper iff 6 o as in the case of configurations preconfigurations have a sort where and are configurations and the sort of is at least 1 k k 0 signifies the configuration which is the result of replacing the k th separator in by the notation which we call a configuration with a distinguished con figuration abbreviates the following configuration 0 0 1 s s s 1 where i o but 0 and s 1 are possibly proper preconfigura tions when a type occurrence a in a configuration is written without vectorial notation that means that the sort of a is 0 however when one writes the models for the displacement calculus 9 metanotation for configurations a this does not mean that the sort of a is necessarily greater than 0 a hypersequent a comprises an antecedent configuration in string based notation of sort i and a succedent type a of sort i the hypersequent calculus for d is as shown in figure 4 the following lemma is useful for the strong a a if a is primitive a il i a ir i 1 a jl j a jr 1 j a b c l b a c a b r b a a b c l a b c a b r a b a b c l a b c a b r a b a b c il b ia i c i a b ir b ia a b c il i a ib c a

concatenation and intercalation ii if v o and o then o similarly if we have o instead of o finally if v o and i o then o 10 oriol valent n proof propositions i and ii are both proved via the bnf derivations of 10 the details of the proof are rather tedious but not difficult what is the connection between the calculi cd and hd in 14 a faithful embedding translation is proved let denote a configuration we define its type equivalent which is a type which has the same algebraic meaning as via the bnf formulation of o c in 10 one defines recursively as follows i 1 j a a if s a 0 0 a 1 s a 1 a s a s a as a s a 1 a 1 1 1 s 1 s s a s a s a 1 if s a 0 the semantic interpretation of a configuration for a given valuation v is v v the embedding translation is as follows for any o cd a iff hd a 2 3 some special das the standard da s induced by the separated monoid with generator set v seg 1 plays an important role the interpretation of the signature d in s is 12 s v i i 0 1 here denotes concatenation and i i 0 i th intercalation we have seen in section 2 that o is closed by concatenation and intercalation i i 0 i e c o i i 0 1 is a d subalgebra of the standard da s since da is a variety 4 c is a general da concretely a nonstandard da to see that c cannot be standard we notice that the sort domains of c are not separated by 1 recall that c i 0 oi c i oi for every i 0 we have that 13 for i 0 c i 6 o 0 o 0 i times because for example let us take p 1 p 0 p 1 p 1 1 p 1 p where p pr 0 the type p 1 p has sort 1 but clearly neither 0 p 1 p nor 1 p 1 p are members of o 0 in fact we have the proper inclusion 14 for i 0 o 0 o 0 i times c i it follows that the class of standard das is a proper subclass of the class of general das 4 we recall that varieties are closed by subalgebras homomorphic images and direct products models for the displacement calculus 11 2 4 synthetic connectives and the implicative fragment from a logical point of view synthetic connectives abbreviate formulas in sequent systems they form new connectives with left and right sequent rules using a linear logic slogan synthetic connectives help to eliminate some bureaucracy in cut free proofs and in the syntactic cut elimination algorithms see 14 we consider here a set of synthetic connectives which are of linguistic interest the binary non deterministic implications and the unary connectives 1 1 and k k 0 which are called respectively left projection right projection and split together with the binary deterministic implications i i 0 i i 0 these constitute what we call implicative connectives these connectives are incorpo rated in the recursive definitions of tp seg and o we denote this implicative fragment as d we write also tp seg and o although as usual if the context is clear we will avoid writing the intuitive semantic inter pretation of the implicative connectives can be found in figure 5 figure 6 and figure 7 correspond to their hypersequent rules besides the usual continuous and discontinuous implications the nondeter ministic discontinous implications are used to account for particle shift nondeter minism where the object can be intercalated between the verb and the particle or after the particle for a particle verb like call 1 up we can give the lexical assigment 1 1 n s n projections can be used to account for the cross serial dependencies of dutch the split connective can be used for parentheticals like fortunately with the type assignment 1 s 1 s j 1 ak jak j left projection j 1 ak j jak right projection j iak jak ii i th

strong completeness of the implicative fragment w r t l models in this section we prove two strong completeness theorems in relation to the implicative fragment in order to prove them we demonstrate

s from 12 induced by the countably infinite set of generators v s v i i 0 1 we define some notation definition 3 for any type c tp and set r of non logical axioms c r o and r c in practice when the set of hypersequents r is clear from the context we simply write c instead of c r lemma 3 truth lemma let p s be the powerset residuated da over the standard da s from 12 let vr be the following valuation on the powerset p s for every p pr vr p p r let m p s vr be called as usual the canonical model the following equality holds for every c tp v r c c r models for the displacement calculus 13 proof we proceed by induction on the structure of type c we will write v instead of v r and instead of r we will say that an element v a is correct 5 iff o c c is primitive true by definition c b ia

by lemma 2 is correct by applying the i right rule to the provable hypersequent i a b we get b ia this ends the case of b ia c a ib completely similar to case b ia c b a or a b similar to the disconcontuous case nondeterministic connectives consider the case c b a b a v b a let a v a by i h a a let b a by s b s a 1 appli cations of left rule we have a a b b by eta expansion l b a i a b for

a 1 by i h i a v b hence v b a conversely let us see v b a b a by i h we see that a v a let v b a this means that for every i 1 s b s a 1 i a v b by i h i a b by a similar reasoning to the deterministic case c b ia we see that is correct we have that 1 a b s b s a 1 a b r b a c a b is completely similar to the previous one c 1 a let us see 1 a v 1 a let 1 a hence 1 a we have that 1 a a

the converse c 1 a is completely similar to the previous one c ka let us see ka v ka let ka we have that ia a a kl ia k a cut k a models for the displacement calculus 15 by i h v ka conversely let us see that v ka ka let v ka by definition k v a by i h and lemma 2 is correct and k a by application of the k right rule ka hence ka by induction on the structure of o see 10 one proves the following lemma lemma 4 identity lemma for any o v let ai i 1 n be the sequence of type occurrences in a configuration let 1 n a 1 an be the result of replacing every type occurrence ai with i recall that we have fixed a set of hypersequents r we have the lemma lemma 5 m p s v r proof let a r for every type occurrence ai in we suppose that the sequence of type occurrences in is ai i 1 n we have by the truth lemma that v ai ai r for any i v ai we have by the truth lemma that r i ai since a r we have then that r a by n applications of the cut rule with the premises i we get from r a that r 1 n a 1 an

suppose prsd r a hence in particular this is true of the canonical model m since v it follows that v a by the truth lemma v a a r hence r a we are done we shall also prove strong completeness w r t l
