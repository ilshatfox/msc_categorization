author thanks the anonymous referee for a careful review and for the suggestion of adding some applications of the main iteration theorem the author also thanks brent cody and monroe eskew for helpful input about section 6 1 http arxiv org abs 1506 00158 v 5 2 sean d cox theorem 1 25 if is regular uncountable then any finite support iteration of cc posets is cc for iterations which are not finite support the situation is much trickier a commonly used theorem in these more general situations is theorem 2 see theorem 16 30 of jech 14 let be a regular uncountable car dinal and let be a limit ordinal let p be an iteration such that for each p p satisfies the chain condition if p is a direct limit and either cf 6 or cf and there are stationarily many such that p is a direct limit then p satisfies the chain condition the difficult part of applying theorem 2 is typically the verification that p is cc when p is an inverse limit usually this is taken care of simply by iterating small posets as in the following corollary which is heavily used throughout the set theory literature corollary 3 baumgartner 1 see also proposition 7 13 of cummings 5 if is inaccessible and p q is an iteration such that for all p q a direct limit is taken at and on a stationary set of limit stages below then p has the cc in fact is knaster what if in the statement of corollary 3 we don t assume that each q is forced to have size this is in general a difficult problem even if the posets q are assumed to be highly closed in fact there is a countable support iteration of length of countably closed 2 cc posets which fails to be 2 cc exercise v 5 23 of kunen 18 a prominent family of iterations which do not use small posets are the so called universal kunen iterations kunen introduced the first version in 17 to prove that saturated ideals on 1 are consistent relative to huge cardinals there he assumed was a huge cardinal and defined a length finite support iteration p q where importantly each q was forced to have size and was in fact from an inner model of v p 1 he used the knaster property of the silver collapse together with theorem 1 about finite support iterations to prove that p had the cc the poset p is highly universal even for many posets of size contrast this with the levy collapse col which is only universal for posets of size the strong universality property of p is the key to obtaining master conditions which enable one to construct a saturated ideal in the final model laver generalized kunen s universal iteration to contexts where larger supports were used in order to obtain saturated ideals on 2 and beyond see 7 for a discus sion of the history however in those settings the cc preservation of the resulting universal iteration had to be checked on a case by case basis 2 and seemingly was believed to be a somewhat delicate issue see remark 20 3 of cummings 5 we prove that at least if is weakly compact then the situation isn t really delicate 1 namely q is the silver collapse to turn into as defined in the model v v p in the case that v p is a regular suborder of p and trivial otherwise see section 5 for a discussion of such iterations 2 e g lemma 4 8 of 10 8 layered posets and kunen s universal collapse 3 at all any universal kunen iteration of cc posets that is where q is forced by v p to be cc 3 will be cc provided that direct limits are used often the proof heavily uses the notion of a layered poset layering has previously appeared in the literature in the form of so called layered ideals e g 12 but it is a general property of posets which is quite useful and interesting a poset p is stationarily layered iff there are stationarily many q p p which are regular suborders of p club layering is defined similarly among the basic facts we prove about layering is the following lemma proved in section 3 3 lemma 4 if p is stationarily layered then p is knaster the converse is in general false see cox lu cke 3 in 3 it is also proved that weak compactness of is equivalent to every cc poset is stationarily layered in short stationarily layered knaster cc and if is weakly compact then the 3 notions are equivalent and highly productive in this paper the notion of layering is used to prove the following general the orems about universal kunen iterations see section 5 for a general discussion of universal kunen iterations and precise statements of the theorems theorem 5 see theorem 49 for the precise statement if is mahlo then any universal kunen iteration of sufficiently layered posets is stationarily layered provided direct limits were taken at all inaccessible theorem 6 see corollary 50 for the precise statement if is weakly compact then any universal kunen iteration of cc posets is stationarily layered provided direct limits were taken at all inaccessible note that in particular by lemma 4 the universal kunen iteration is knaster in the conclusion of both theorems we give several applications of theorem 6 the statement of the meta mathematical theorem 7 below is necessarily somewhat technical the role of the parameter r in 1 is to allow for example that the forcing is defined insideh using some book keeping device e g a parameter which is a to one surjection from h used to define some iteration of length see corollary 8 for specific exam ples of posets which satisfy the requirements of theorem 7 theorem 7 assume is a set theoretic formula with two free variables and zfc proves the following whenever is a successor of a regular cardinal then there exists an r h such that letting be the cardinal predecessor of s h r z h h z r is a closed cc poset of size at most 1 then whenever v is a model of zfc and v are regular cardinals and is a huge cardinal there is a closed poset in v which forces the following statements 2 and 2 there is a normal saturated ideal j on 3 note this is an apparently weaker assumption than requiring that q is forced by p to be cc though in the end they are equivalent if is weakly compact 4 sean d cox there exists some r h such that 1 holds and there exists some regular embedding e s h r j the formula in the assumptions of theorem 7 can be designed in ways to specify a particular n or to specify that certain other requirements are met if desired 4 the following corollary lists some specific examples which satisfy the requirements of theorem 7 we say that r absorbs q if there exists a regular embedding from q r corollary 8 fix n n 1 each of the following posets can consistently be absorbed by the quotient of a saturated ideal on n 1 jensen s n closed forcing of size n 1 under gch to add an n kurepa tree see 5 2 the forcing to add a single hechler subset of n 6 3 a n 1 closed n 1 suslin tree 4 the n 1 length n 1 support iteration of adding hechler subsets of n 1 6 more generally any sufficiently definable 5 n 1 support iter ation of length n 1 which uses n 1 closed posets of size n at each step 5 n 1 support n 1 length iteration of sacks n 1 as in kanamori 15 6 the following poset can consistently be absorbed into the quotient of a sat urated ideal on 2 the closed 2 cc poset of size 3 from shelah 24 which he used to force 2 1 3 together with a generalized version of mar tin s axiom for a certain subclass of the closed 2 cc posets finally we prove that a certain instance of chang s conjecture is consistent the tree property theorem 9 if are both regular and is a huge cardinal then there is a forcing extension which satisfies the following the chang s conjecture 3 holds and the tree property holds at 3 in particular for any n the tree property at n 3 is consistent with the chang s conjecture n 3 n 1 n 1 n the paper is organized as follows section 2 includes some preliminaries section 3 introduces layered posets proves that layering implies the knaster condition provides some examples and proves a useful lemma about lay ering and elementary embeddings 4 note that is definable in h as the 2 nd largest cardinal so for example if one has in mind a definable cc forcing which only has the desired properties when say 2 then one can simply insert and the 2 nd largest cardinal is 2 into the formula this will have the effect of making s h r into the trivial poset when 6 2 similarly if one has in mind a definable cc forcing which only makes sense when 2 then simply insert and the 2 nd largest cardinal satisfies gch into the formula this would have the effect of making s h r into the trivial poset when 2 5 see theorem 7 for precisely what is meant here layered posets and kunen s universal collapse 5 section 4 introduces the important notion of a coherent conservative sys tem of reduction operations and proves lemma 43 which is crucial to passing limit stages in the proofs of section 5 section 5 provides the relevant background for universal kunen type itera tions and proves the precise versions of theorems 5 and 6 section 6 proves theorems 7 and 9 2 preliminaries 2 1 regular embeddings and quotient forcing if p q are conditions in a poset p we write p q to mean that p is stronger than q p q to mean that p and q are compatible and p q to mean that p and q are incompatible given p names and we will say that is equivalent to modulo p iff p the maximality principle is the fact that if p p x x where is a statement in the forcing language then there is some p name such that p a function e p q is a regular embedding iff it is order and incompatibility preserving and whenever a is a maximal antichain in p then e a is a maximal antichain in q if id p q is a regular embedding then p is called a regular suborder of q if id p q is order and incompatibility preserving but not necessarily regular then we say p is a suborder of q definition 10 let p be a suborder of q and q q we say that p p is a reduct of q into p iff p p p p q q if p is also q q then we say p is a nice reduct of q into p the following lemma is standard but we provide the short proof for convenience note that the reduction characterization yields a 0 characterization of the regular suborder relation lemma 11 let p be a suborder of q the following are equivalent 1 p is a regular suborder of q 2 for every q q there is a reduct of q into p proof assume p is a regular suborder of q so every maximal antichain in p is a maximal antichain in q assume for a contradiction there is some q q which has no reduct this implies that d q p p p q q is dense in p let g be q generic with q g then g p is p generic and so g d q 6 contradicting that g is a filter on q and that q g for the other direction let a be a maximal antichain in p let q be any condition in q and let pq be any reduct of q into p let a a be compatible in p with pq and let p p witness this compatibility because p pq it follows that p q q then q is compatible with a a because q was arbitrary then a is maximal in q definition 12 suppose e p q is a regular embedding p p and q q we write q e p to mean q q p e 1 g q 6 sean d cox where e 1 g q denotes the set of all conditions in p which are weaker than some condition in e 1 g q if q q and p p we say that p is an e reduct of q iff p p p e p q q note that if e id and q is separative then q e p is equivalent to q q p lemma 13 suppose b and c are complete boolean algebras and e b c is a regular embedding let c c and set bec supb b b b is an e reduct of c then 1 bec is an e reduct of c and moreover is the largest one 2 bec e c as in definition 12 proof to see that bec is an e reduct of c let b bec with b 6 0 by the definition of bec there is some b which is an e reduct of c such that b b 6 0 then b b b and because b is an e reduct of c we have e b b c because e is order preserving and b b b we have e b c which completes the proof that bec is an e reduct of c clearly it is the largest such by its definition as the sup of all e reducts of c to see that bec e c suppose toward a contradiction that this were false then there is some c c such that c c b e c e 1 g c it follows easily that 2 c e bec let b be any e reduct of c then b bec b e c otherwise b bec and because c e b this would contradict 2 because b bec b e c and b e c is defined as the supremum of all e reducts of c then b bec is not a reduct of c we will prove that b bec is in fact an e reduct of c which will yield a contradiction and complete the proof so let r b bec r 6 0 then r b or r bec case 1 r b because b is an e reduct of c then e r c and because c c this implies e r c case 2 r bec then because b e c is an e reduct of c by the first part of the proof we have e r c corollary 14 suppose b is a complete regular subalgebra of c and c c let bc supb b b b is a reduct of c then bc is a nice reduct of c proof this follows immediately from lemma 13 by taking the e from that lemma to be the identity map from b c the following fact is well known lemma 15 if e p q is a regular embedding of separative posets then e lifts to a regular embedding of their boolean completions layered posets and kunen s universal collapse 7 if the map e from lemma 15 is the identity i e if p is a regular suborder of q then we can essentially take the lifting to the boolean completions to be the identity map which simplifies the notation a bit in other words if p is a regular suborder of q then we can extend both to view ro p as a regular suborder of ro q i m grateful to joel david hamkins for pointing this out to me on mathoverflow lemma 16 13 suppose p is a regular suborder of the separative poset q in ro q define b p sup ro q x x p then b p is a complete regular subalgebra of ro q and p is dense in b p so b p ro p definition 17 let p be a regular suborder of the separative poset q and let q q set weakestreductro p q sup b ro p b is a reduct of q where we are viewing ro p as a regular complete subalgebra of ro q as in lemma 16 we will often use the following convention convention 18 assume p is a regular suborder of q is a statement in the p forcing language and q q we will write q q to mean the following whenever g is q generic with q g then v g p g p lemma 19 let p be a regular suborder of q q q and a statement in the forcing language of p then the following are equivalent 1 q q as in convention 18 2 weakestreductro p q ro p proof by corollary 14 weakestreductro p q is a nice reduct of q into ro p i e it is a reduct and moreover weakestreductro p q q to see 1 implies 2 if not then there is some p weakestreductro p q in ro p such that p forces the negation of but because weakestreductro p q is a reduct then p is compatible in ro q with q yielding a contradiction to assumption 1 to see that 2 implies 1 this is simply because weakestreductro p q q any ro q generic which includes q must also include weakestreductro p q so assumption 2 ensures that holds in any such generic extension if p is a regular suborder of q and gp is generic for p then in v gp the quotient q gp is defined as the set of all q q which are compatible in q with every member of gp the ordering of q gp is the order inherited from q the following fact is standard fact 20 if p is a regular suborder of q then q is forcing equivalent to p q g p we will also use the following fact in the proof of theorem 7 fact 21 if p is a regular suborder of q and q has the cc then p q g p has the cc 8 sean d cox proof suppose for a contradiction that there is some p p forcing that there is a sized antichain in the quotient by the maximaility principle there is a p name q which is forced by p to be an antichain in the quotient but then p q is easily seen to be an antichain in p q g p by fact 20 this implies q fails to have the cc a contradiction 2 2 generalized sacks forcing the proof of theorem 9 will make use of the following generalized sacks forcing if t is a subtree of 2 and s 2 we say that s splits in t iff both s 0 and s 1 are in t definition 22 kanamori 15 definition 1 1 let be a regular uncountable cardinal sacks is the poset of all subtrees t of 2 such that 1 if is a limit ordinal s 2 and s t for every then s t 2 if s t then there is a t t such that s t and t splits in t 3 if is a limit ordinal s 2 and s splits in t for cofinally many then s splits in t t is stronger than s iff t s lemma 23 if t sacks and f 2 is a cofinal branch through t i e f t for all then cf t f splits in t is a closed unbounded subset of proof by requirement 3 of definition 22 it suffices to show that cf t is cofinal in fix any 0 because f 0 t then by requirement 2 of definition 22 there is some g f 0 which splits in t i e g 0 t and g 1 t let f g be the maximal ordinal such that g f g f f g notice that f g 0 we claim that f f g splits in t for conceptual clarity consider two cases 1 if f g dom g then g 0 f f g 0 and g 1 f f g 1 because both of these functions are in t by the assumption that g splits in t this shows that f f g splits in t 2 if f g dom g then g f g f f g and g f g 6 f f g because g f g 1 and f f g 1 are both in t this again implies that f f g splits in t kanamori 15 lemma 1 2 proves that sacks is closed but we will actually need a bit more recall that if d is a subset of a poset p we say d is directed iff whenever d 0 d 1 d then there is a d d such that d d 0 and d d 1 a poset p is directed closed iff whenever d is a sized directed subset of p then d has a lower bound in p lemma 24 for all regular uncountable the poset sacks is directed closed proof let d be a sized directed subset of sacks we prove that d inherits all requirements of conditionhood from definition 22 the only nontrivial part is verifying requirement 2 all other requirements of definition 22 are easily inherited by arbitrary intersections of conditions so suppose s d we need to find some t s which splits in d layered posets and kunen s universal collapse 9 claim 24 1 there is an f 2 extending s such that f is a cofinal branch through every member of d proof we recursively define f for all dom s and verify inductively that f d for all such first set f dom s s if is a limit ordinal then f is defined as the union of f for all the induction hypothesis and requirement 1 of definition 22 ensure that f d now suppose f is defined we want to define f 1 we claim that at least one of f 0 or f 1 is an element of d if not then there are t 0 t 1 d such that f 0 t 0 and f 1 t 1 because d is directed there is a t d such that t t 0 t 1 now the induction hypothesis ensures that f t and requirement 2 of definition 22 ensures that f i t for at least one i 0 1 but then f i ti a contradiction let f 2 be as given by the claim and for every t d let cf t be the club from lemma 23 because d c t d cf t is club in pick some c dom s then f splits in every member of d i e f 0 and f 1 are both in d because f s this completes the proof 2 3 other miscellaneous background a regular uncountable cardinal is weakly compact iff is inaccessible and whenever m is a transitive zf model of size and m is closed under sequences then there is a transitive set n and an elementary embedding j m n with critical point there are many other well known equivalent formulations almost huge iff there is an elementary embedding j v n with critical point such that n is closed under j sequences huge iff there is an elementary embedding j v n with critical point such that n is closed under j sequences the tree property holds at iff whenever t is a tree of height and each level of t is of size then t has a cofinal branch if 3 2 1 0 are cardinals then the chang s conjecture 3 2 1 0 means whenever a is a first order structure on 3 in a countable language then there is an x a such that x 1 and x 2 0 various versions of this are discussed at length in 7 the proof of theorem 7 makes use of foreman s duality theorem specifically regarding the magidor variation of kunen s original argument all of these topics are covered extensively in 7 but we only need a special case to describe the special case we recall see kanamori 16 that a sequence u u is called a tower iff each u is a normal measure on p and if then u x p v x v u given such a tower if there is an elementary embedding k ult v u ult v u such that j k j where j and j are the ultrapower maps for u and u respectively this yields a directed system of ultrapower maps and a 10 sean d cox direct limit ultrapower embedding j u v u n u with critical point such that n u is wellfounded and in fact 3 n u is closed under sequences and in general j u if j u then u is called an almost huge tower in that case by 3 notice that n u is closed under j u crit j u sequences we use the following fact fact 25 suppose j v n is a huge embedding with critical point i e j is elementary and n is closed under j sequences then there exists an almost huge tower u and an elementary embedding k n u n such that j k j u and crit k n u note in particular this implies that k fixes and that n u n an ideal i on a regular uncountable cardinal is called normal if it is closed under diagonal unions and saturated iff i has the chain condition the following theorem is a special instance of the duality theorem of foreman 7 see also foreman komjath 10 or section 5 3 of cox zeman 4 for more detailed proofs theorem 26 suppose u is an almost huge tower and j u v u n u is the corresponding embedding suppose p v is a cc poset c silv is the p name for the silver collapse which turns into described in section 3 2 and in n u there exists a regular embedding p c silv j u p such that is the identity on p 6 let g h be generic for p c silv over v then in v g h there is a normal ideal i j u on such that i j u is forcing equivalent to j u p g h we use one more fact about normal ideals fact 27 7 if i is a normal saturated ideal on then i is a complete boolean algebra 3 layered posets 3 1 basic theory of layered posets a layered poset is roughly a poset which has many small regular suborders where many is typically taken to mean club or stationarily many there are two common definitions of stationarity for subsets of p h where h is any set of cardinality at least strong stationarity as definition 8 21 of jech 14 a set s p h is strongly stationary in p h iff s c 6 for all c p h which are cofinal in p h and closed under increasing unions of length shelah s weak stationarity or generalized stationarity e g as in larson 19 and foreman 7 a set s p h is weakly stationary in p h iff whenever f h h then there is some x s which is closed under f the set of all x h which are closed under f is denoted by cf 6 i e p 1 p for every p p layered posets and kunen s universal collapse 11 for 1 the notions strongly stationary in p h and weakly stationary in p h are equivalent but for 2 they may differ due to the presence or absence of changs conjecture this is discussed in detail in foreman 7 convention 28 unless stated otherwise in this paper stationary will refer to jech s strong stationarity 7 for example in the proof of lemma 4 it is essential that the stationary layering occurs on models m such that m this happens automatically in any strongly stationary set but if 1 it might fail for a weakly stationary set the following is the main definition definition 29 let p be a poset a regular uncountable cardinal with p and reg p x p p x is a regular suborder of p 1 p is stationarily layered iff reg p is stationary in p p 2 p is club layered iff reg p contains a club i e p p reg p is not stationary 3 p is cofinally layered iff reg p is cofinal in p p recall convention 28 we are referring to jech s strong stationarity here remark 30 by standard lifting and projecting of stationary sets see theorem 8 27 of 14 the following are equivalent 1 p is stationarily layered 2 the set x p h x p is a regular suborder of p is stationary in p h where h is any set such that p h the analogous equivalence also holds if we replace stationary by contains a club and if we replace stationary by weakly stationary definition 31 assume p h and s p h is stationary we say that p is layered a e on s iff m p m s reg p is nonstationary equivalently m p is regular in p for all but nonstationarily many m s a special case of the following lemma that appears in the literature is shelah s work on layered ideals lemma 32 shelah see 7 if p is weakly stationarily layered i e if the set of regular suborders of p is weakly stationary in p p then p is cc proof let a be a maximal antichain of p let be a sufficiently large regular cardinal so that a p h by remark 30 the weakly stationary version there is an x h p a note that a x with x such that x p is a regular suborder of p because x h p a then a x is a maximal antichain in x p because x p is regular in p then a x is a maximal antichain in p it follows that a x a i e that a is a subset of the sized set x so a 7 we could alternatively stick with weak stationarity but require that our stationary subsets of p h concentrate on those m p h such that m 12 sean d cox for posets of size it is often more natural to work with filtrations of the poset to determine if the poset is layered a filtration of a set x is a increasing continuous sequence x cf x such that x x for all x and x cf x x if cf x is uncountable then any two filtrations agree on a club subset of cf x the proof of the following is standard so we omit it lemma 33 suppose p is a poset of size where is regular and uncountable the following are equivalent 1 p is stationarily layered 2 for some filtration q of p there are stationarily many such that q is a regular suborder of p 3 for every filtration q of p there are stationarily many such that q is a regular suborder of p if m h p and p p then p is called an m p master condition iff p m g ord m ord the following correspondence between cc and master conditions is due to mekler lemma 34 mekler 21 given a poset p and a regular uncountable cardinal the following are equivalent 1 p is cc 2 there are stationarily many m p h such that 1 p is an m p master condition if 1 then these are also equivalent to there are club many m p h such that 1 p is an m p master condition just as lemma 34 characterizes cc in terms of master conditions stationary layering can be expressed in terms of strong master conditions as defined by mitchell 22 if m is a model p is a poset and p p mitchell 23 defined p to be an m p strong master condition iff every p p has a reduction in m p note that if p h and x h p then by elementarity x p is a subor der of p i e we have order and preservation in both directions the following observation is straightforward using the reduct characterization of regularity in lemma 11 observation 35 if x h p the following are equivalent x p is a regular suborder of p 1 p is an x p strong master condition in the sense of mitchell 23 corollary 36 given a poset p and a regular uncountable cardinal the following are equivalent 1 p is stationarily layered 2 there are stationarily many m p h such that 1 p is a m p strong master condition proof this follows immediately observation 35 3 2 examples of layered posets many commonly used posets are stationarily layered under mild cardinal arithmetic assumptions in fact they are often layered a e on some natural stationary set s i e club layered relative to s here are a few common examples of stationarily layered posets all under the assumption layered posets and kunen s universal collapse 13 that is strongly inaccessible much less than inaccessibility is needed for most of these given the right cardinal arithmetic assumptions 1 trivially any poset of density is club layered 2 any poset as in the hypothesis of corollary 3 is stationarily layered 3 if is inaccessible then the levy collapse col is layered a e on the stationary set of closed models in p h recall we are using strong stationarity here so almost every such model has transitive intersection with if then it is club layered on p 1 v 4 if is inaccessible then the silver collapse csilv that turns into is layered a e on the stationary set of closed elements of p h the poset csilv is the support product of col with bounded domain that is conditions are partial functions p such that p p whenever dom p and there is some p such that whenever dom p then 5 if is mahlo then the easton collapse e is layered a e on the stationary set of w p v such that w w w and w w w conditions are partial functions p such that p whenever dom p there is some such that whenever dom p and the support of p i e the set dom p is easton above a set x is easton above iff x whenever is regular 6 the poset b from foreman komjath 10 is layered a e on the sta tionary set of closed elements of p v here are regular cardinals and conditions are elements of the support product of many copies of col which have a bounded domain more precisely let ci col for each i so these are many copies of col a condition is a supported function p i ci such that there is some p such that dom p i p for all i supp p 7 any cc poset and any support product of cc posets where is stationarily layered if is weakly compact by 3 we prove that the easton collapse e is layered on the stationary set indicated above the proofs that the other posets are layered is similar with the exception of the weakly compact example which is proved in 3 pick any w h such that w w w and w w w let p e and let s be the support of p which is easton above as defined in 5 above because s is easton w is regular inaccessible and w is closed under w sequences then p w is an element of w note that because w then p w is the same as p w we need to prove that it is a reduct suppose p w is a condition extending p w then clearly p p is a function because p being in w does not make any commitments for those w let p be the uniform bound for p s domains and p be the uniform bound for p s domains then max p p is a uniform bound for p p so p p is a condition remark 37 naturally defined layered posets as in the examples listed above typi cally have stationarily layered products simply because the stationary sets witness ing layering have stationary overlap for example foreman komjath 10 consider products of the form s b 14 sean d cox where is inaccessible as remarked above s is layered a e on the set of closed models and b is layered a e on the set of closed models because the intersection of these stationary sets is the set of closed models which is stationary it follows that their product is layered a e on the set of closed models this and other issues surrounding products are addressed in detail in cox lu cke 3 it also follows from the more general fact that if pi is a strong master condition for m pi for i 0 1 then p 0 p 1 is a strong master condition for m p 0 p 1 see mitchell 23 3 3 relation to knaster property a poset is called knaster if every sized collection of conditions can be refined to a sized collection of pairwise compat ible conditions clearly knaster implies cc the main feature of the knaster property used in the literature is fact 38 see 5 if p is knaster and q is cc then p q is cc we now prove lemma 4 that stationary layering implies knaster the proof is modeled after the proof of theorem 4 1 of soukup 26 let p be stationarily layered and let x be a sized collection of conditions in p by the layering assumption of p there is an m h p such that x m m m and m p is a regular suborder of p because m x there is some p x m let p m be any reduct of p into m p let z be a maximal subset of x with the property that z consists of pairwise compatible conditions and every member of z is compatible with p m since x and p m are members of m we can without loss of generality take z m we claim that z if not then because z m and z it follows that z m and because m is transitive 8 4 z m it follows that z z p now p is clearly compatible with p m and z p is a subset of x thus we will obtain a contradiction to maximality of z if we can prove that z p is pairwise compatible let r z then 4 implies r m p and by the requirements on z we have r p p m since r and p m are in m then this compatibility is witnessed by some r r p m such that r m because r p m it follows that r p p which implies that r p p this proves that z p is pairwise compatible completing the proof remark 39 it is natural to wonder if the implication of lemma 4 can be reversed if is weakly compact then the answer is yes and for non weakly compact cardinals the answer is in general no see cox lu cke 3 3 4 layering and elementary embeddings the following simple but useful lemma will be used in the proof of theorem 6 and also in 3 lemma 40 suppose j h n is a 0 elementary embedding of zfc models crit j j h n equivalently j n q h is a poset n q is cc 8 note the essential use of transitivity of m in this part of the argument layered posets and kunen s universal collapse 15 q h q n then j h j q is a regular suborder of j q proof because j h n and x is a regular suborder of y is a 0 property using the reduct characterization it suffices to prove that n believes j h j q is regular in j q clearly j q q j q is order and incompatibility preserving so we only need to check that whenever a n is a maximal antichain in q then j a is maximal in j q so let a n be maximal antichain in q because q h q n and n q is cc then a h and has size in h since crit j this implies that j a j a but by elementarity n believes that j a is maximal in j q completing the proof 4 coherent conservative systems of reduction operations the iteration we describe in the main theorem isn t presented in the usual way so we will make the following ad hoc definition it is really a definition about how a poset is presented definition 41 a sequence of posets l will be called a generalized iteration iff each l consists of partial functions on the restriction map is a forcing projection from l l for all that is is order preserving and whenever q p then there is some p p such that p q the identity map is a regular embedding from l l for all the following definition very important for the main theorem if l is a suborder of r a map r l is called a reduction operation iff r is a reduct of r into l for all r r 9 i e whenever r and l then is compatible with r 10 definition 42 assume l l and r l are two generalized iterations of the same length and assume that l is a regular suborder of r for all a system of reduction maps r l will be called coherent iff r r for all and all r r conservative iff whenever r r is some condition in r witnessing compatibility of with r then there is some r r such that r r and r witnesses compatibility of with r the conservativity requirement is used to pass inverse limit stages of inductively defined reduction mappings roughly it says that if you re checking compatibility in a proof that some condition is a reduct you can do it without strengthening what you did earlier 9 see section 2 for a discussion of reducts 10 note that this is not the same as a forcing projection a forcing projection would require instead that there is some r r such that r 16 sean d cox lemma 43 assume l and r are generalized iterations of limit length and that r l is a coherent conservative system of reduction maps assume l and r use some mix of inverse and direct limits and that their limit scheme is the same more precisely for each limit ordinal either 1 l and r are both direct limits or 2 l and r are both inverse limits let l and r be limits of l and r respectively where either both are direct limits or both are inverse limits then there is a reduction map r l such that is a coherent conservative system of reduction maps proof we prove the lemma assuming that both l and r are inverse limits as this is the hardest case notice that the coherency of ensures that 5 lim r r r r also the coherency requirement that we desire of compels us to define r r that r is a condition in l follows from the facts that coherency of ensures that r end extends r whenever l and r use the same limit type we must prove that conservativity is preserved the proof will also show that is a reduction mapping so assume and r r is some condition in r witnessing compatibility of with r we need to find some r r such that r r and r witnesses compatibility of with r we construct such an r using the assumption that is conservative together with 5 namely recursively define a sequence r as follows if r is defined let r 1 be some condition in r 1 given by the conserva tivity between and 1 that is r 1 r r 1 witnesses compatibility of 1 with r 1 if index is a trivial coordinate for both and r i e if 1 and r 1 r then we require that the th coordinate of r 1 is also trivial more precisely that r 1 r if is limit let r r the triviality requirement at successor steps of the construction together with the assumption that l and r use the same limit scheme ensures that each r is a condition in r it clear that r r whenever and that r is as required though lemma 43 assumes that the iterations use some mix of inverse and direct limits we suspect a similar fact holds for many common iteration schemes e g rcs iterations layered posets and kunen s universal collapse 17 5 universal kunen iterations the universal kunen iteration was introduced by kunen 17 in the first consis tency proof of a saturated ideal on 1 and is a useful tool when huge embeddings are involved roughly one has a large cardinal and defines some sort of iteration of length where successor steps are handled as follows given that 0 and p has been defined if v p is a regular suborder of p set p 1 p q where q is some poset from the inner model v g v otherwise set p 1 p 1 in the applications below it will be helpful to describe the kunen iteration a bit differently from typical iterations but these will still be iterations in the general sense of iteration that is a commutative system of forcing projections the scheme below was roughly described in foreman 7 definition 44 let be an uncountable regular cardinal a sequence p q will be called a universal kunen iteration iff 1 p is a generalized iteration as in definition 41 2 for each the poset p 1 has the following form if v p is not a regular suborder of p then we will call a passive stage and set p 1 p otherwise i e if v p is a regular suborder of p then we will call an active stage and require that q is a v p name for a poset 11 and p 1 consists of all partial functions f on 1 with the following properties f p if dom f then f v v p notice this is a v p name not merely a p name and v p f q where the partial ordering is given by f 1 p 1 f 0 f 1 p f 0 and if dom f 0 then dom f 1 and f 1 convention p f 1 q f 0 where we are using convention 18 together with the assumption that v p is a regular suborder of p to view the statement f 1 q f 0 as a statement in the language of p as usual we can arrange that p is a set rather than a proper class by choosing a single representative of the various names in the definition modulo equivalence of names we will insist that such a representative is always chosen of minimal rank the following is a standard fact fact 45 suppose is regular and r h is a poset if is a r name which is forced to be in h g r then there is a r name h which is r equivalent to i e r lemma 46 suppose p q is a universal kunen iteration as in definition 44 which uses some mix of inverse and direct limits and that for every active 6 v p q v g where g is the canonical v p name for its generic object also assume that p is a direct limit then 11 we emphasize that q is a v p name not merely a p name 18 sean d cox 1 p v 2 if j v n is an elementary embedding with critical point then j p p j p v if p is cc then is an active stage of j p and thus by reflection there are many active stages of p proof for item 1 because p is a direct limit then it suffices to prove that each p v for note that given the setup of definition 44 a direct limit is simply a union we prove by induction that p v for every 12 for limit stage this follows simply from the induction hypothesis and inaccessibility of the latter is needed if p is say an inverse limit now suppose p v and let f p 1 we need to prove that f v because f p v by the induction assumption it only remains to show that f v this follows from assumption 6 and fact 45 together with our convention that a representative for a name is always chosen of minimal rank the proof that v j p p is proved similarly for item 2 by item 1 j p is just the identity map on p if f p then because p is a direct limit f p for some so j f f pick any in the domain of f then f p and v p forces that f q by elementarity of j n believes that j f j f is an element of the j th member of j p and that j f f is forced by j v p v j p j v j p to be a member of j q this proves that j f f is a member of j p so in particular a member of j p finally if we know that p is cc then because crit j it follows that j p idp is a regular embedding from p j p j p j i e r 0 j p is a regular suborder of r 2 j p j but because we now know that r 0 j p is actually a suborder of r 1 j p by the previous part of the proof and because r 1 j p is regular in r 2 j p j because j p is a generalized iteration it abstractly follows that r 0 j p is a regular suborder of r 1 j p 13 since we showed earlier that j p v j p it follows that is an active stage of j p the following lemma ensures preservation of closure properties lemma 47 let be regular cardinals suppose p q is a universal kunen iteration with the following properties for all active v p q is closed the iteration uses supports i e for all limit p consists of those partial functions f such that dom f is a sized subset of and f p for all dom f then p is closed 12 recall that we use the convention that all names for conditions are taken to be of minimal rank 13 in general if r 0 is a suborder of r 1 r 1 is a suborder of r 2 and r 0 is a regular suborder of r 2 it follows easily that r 0 is a regular suborder of r 1 layered posets and kunen s universal collapse 19 proof this is basically the standard proof that support iterations of closed posets is closed as in section 2 of 1 with a variation at successor steps due to the requirement of definition 44 that we only use v p names rather than p names fix and suppose fi i is a descending sequence in p note that dom fi i is a increasing sequence of sized sets and by regularity of it follows that d i dom fi has size we recursively define a function f with domain d and verify that f is a condition in p and is a lower bound for the fi s suppose and f is defined for all and that the following induction hypothesis ih holds for each ih f 1 is a lower bound in p 1 for the sequence fi 1 i and dom f 1 d first observe that the fact that ih holds for all immediately implies 7 f is a lower bound in p for fi i if we are done otherwise we need to define f and verify that ih holds if d then f isn t defined i e dom f then ih is immediate so from now on assume d then dom fi for all sufficiently large i say for all i i note that by the definition of the ordering for p 1 together with the assumption that the fi s are descending it follows that 8 i i j fj convention v p fj q fi then 7 and 8 together imply f conventionv p fi i i is descending in q because v p forces by assumption that q is closed then by the maxi mality principle there is a v p name q such that f conventionv p q is a lower bound for fi i i then set f q then ih clearly holds here is how such universal iterations are typically used we concentrate on kunen s original construction for concreteness suppose j v n is a huge embedding with critical point and let j kunen defined a finite support iteration p q as in definition 44 where one starts by forcing with p 1 col and then at each active one forces with s v v p kunen s proof that p is cc goes by induction limit steps are taken care of by theorem 1 and successor steps 1 are taken care of by the induction hypoth esis that p is cc together with the fact that s v v p is knaster so the product of sv v p with the cc quotient p v p is cc by fact 38 then by lemma 46 is an active stage of j p and so the identity regular embed ding from p j p lifts to a regular embedding from p s v p j p thus if g is generic over n for j p then in n g there is a g h which is generic over v for p s v p then j lifts to jg v g n g and n g sees that m jg h is a condition in its silver collapse s n g j forcing below 20 sean d cox m yields a lifting of j to a map from v g h n g h but one can approxi mate such a lifting in the model v g without actually forcing with h because this occurs in the cc extension v g the resulting derived ideal in v g h will be v g h cc i e saturated we refer the reader to foreman 7 for more details here are some examples of such iterations in the literature on saturated ideals the columns of the table correspond to the scheme described in definition 44 above kunen s original paper 17 dealt only with ideals on 1 and used finite support iteration laver showed how to do support iterations for arbitrary regular in certain situations in all cases are regular cardinals and p 0 is the levy collapse col or the silver collapse s see section 3 2 for the definitions of these posets in the table g denotes the canonical v p name for its generic object paper q when v p p supports kunen 17 sv g finite i e magidor see 7 colv g laver 20 ev g foreman komjath 10 sv g bv g foreman 9 and foreman laver 11 a certain product of silver collapses the following is the key technical theorem of this section theorem 48 let be mahlo and p q be a universal kunen iteration as in definition 44 which uses some mix of inverse and direct limits assume w h p is such that w w w and w w w assume that 1 p is a direct limit 2 p w is a direct limit 3 for every w v p q v g where g is the canonical v p name for its generic 4 for every w v p w g q is a regular suborder of q note this is trivially true for non active then w p is a regular suborder of p proof note that lemma 46 implies p v fix any w h p as in the hypotheses of the theorem and set w w we will recursively construct a coherent conservative system of reduction operations 9 w p w p w layered posets and kunen s universal collapse 21 at the end of the proof we will use the system from 9 to get a reduction operation from p w p let w and assume that the system 9 has been constructed below we need to define w assume first that is a successor ordinal say 1 so w p w p is a reduction operation if is passive then p p and w w works otherwise is active and assumption 4 and the maximality principle imply there is some v p name such that v p q w g q is a reduction operation given f p 1 define w 1 f as follows the first coordinates are given by w f now consider the v p name f assumption 3 implies f is an element of v g w g because w then v p v w w v so v g w g is forced to be the same as w v g v w g by fact 45 there is some v p name y w f v w w such that 10 v p y w f f we use this y w f as the th coordinate i e w 1 f w f y wf note that because y w f w and w maps into w p by the induction assumption then w 1 maps into w p 1 we must verify that w 1 1 w 1 is conservative and coherent coherence of w 1 1 w 1 follows immediately from the inductively assumed coherency of w 1 together with the definition of w 1 finally we check conservativity of w 1 1 w 1 which will also show that w 1 is a reduction operation as defined immediately before definition 42 assume f p 1 h p 1 w 1 f where h w f p f and f p h we need to find some f p 1 such that f p 1 f f f and f p 1 h our inductive hypothesis that w 1 is conservative ensures that there is an f p such that f p f f f and f p h now consider the v p names f and h now h p w f and 11 h p h q w 1 f y w f where again we are using convention 18 let weakestreductro v p h be the maximum reduct of h into ro v p as in definition 17 then 11 and lemma 19 imply that 12 weakestreductro v p h ro v p h q w 1 f y w f f because h w and w it follows that h w which in turn implies 13 weakestreductro v p ro v p h q w g 22 sean d cox because is forced by v p to be a reduction from q q w g then 12 and 13 imply 14 weakestreductro v p h ro v p q q f such that q q h by the maximality principle there is a v p name q h f such that 15 weakestreductro v p h ro v p q h f q f and q h f q h and by standard definition of names by cases we canwlog assume that v p q h f q and that v p q h f q f so f f q h f is a condition in p 1 f p 1 f and f f f we only have left to check that 16 f p 1 h now 17 f f p h and f q h f so we only have left to prove that 18 f convention p q h f q h moreover by 17 it in turn suffices to prove 19 h conventionp q h f q h but this follows from 15 and lemma 19 this completes the proof that w 1 1 w 1 is a coherent conservative system of reduction operations this completes the case where is a successor ordinal now assume is a limit ordinal still assuming w because stage of p is either an inverse or a direct limit and because w w w and w it follows that p and p w use the same limit scheme with respect to p and p w respectively so lemma 43 applies and ensures that the natural limit of w depending on the limit scheme used at is a reduction and thus we obtain a coherent conservative system of reductions w we have constructed a coherent conservative system w w now by the assumptions that w w w and that p w is a direct limit then p w and w p w are direct limits of p w and w p w respectively so we may again invoke lemma 43 to extend this to a coherent conservative system w w although p w w because p w is a direct limit then we still have that id w p w p w is order and incompatibility preserving this together with the existence of the reduction operation w w p w w p w implies that w p w is a regular suborder of p w because p w is a regular suborder of p it follows that 20 w p w is a regular suborder of p finally observe that because both p w pw and p are direct limits then 21 w p w p w layered posets and kunen s universal collapse 23 note this is a literal equality because our conditions are partial functions i e direct limits are simply unions 14 so 20 and 21 together imply that w p is a regular suborder of p the following theorem is almost an immediate corollary of theorem 48 however it is typically less useful than theorem 50 because typically is a very large cardinal in the context of universal kunen iterations theorem 49 assume is mahlo p q is a universal kunen iteration as in definition 44 which uses some mix of inverse and direct limits and that p is a direct limit for all inaccessible let w denote the statement that w h w w and w w w assume that for each v p q is layered a e on m v g m and v p q v g where g is the canonical v p name for its generic then p is layered a e on the stationary set w v w i e for all but nonstationarily many w w p is a regular suborder of p in particular p is knaster by lemma 4 proof note that is stationary because is mahlo and the assumptions guarantee by lemma 46 that p v for each active let a be a v p name for a first order structure on h g witnessing the a e part of the assumption about q i e so that 22 v p m m a m q m is a regular suborder of q now let w such that w h p a let w w because v p w then in particular v p has the w cc so together with w closure of w and the fact that a w we have v p w g and w g a thus by 22 we obtain 23 w v p q w g is a regular suborder of q then 23 together with our assumptions that p is a direct limit for all inaccessible implies by theorem 48 that w p is a regular suborder of p we finally state and prove the precise version of theorem 6 it tells us that if is weakly compact and direct limits are used at all inaccessibles then any universal kunen iteration of cc posets will be stationarily layered and thus knaster we emphasize that assumption 3 in the statement of theorem 50 is only assuming that v p forces q to be cc it is not assuming that q remains cc in v p though this will be the case automatically in the end 14 if f w p then w believes there is some such that f p so this must be strictly below w w thus f w p w 24 sean d cox theorem 50 suppose is weakly compact and p q is a universal kunen iteration as in definition 44 which uses some mix of inverse and direct limits suppose 1 direct limits are taken at all inaccessible 2 for every active v p q v g 3 each q is forced by v p to be cc 15 then p v and is layered on some stationary subset of w p v w v for some inaccessible in particular p is knaster by lemma 4 proof first note that is stationary because is mahlo also lemma 46 implies that p v suppose toward a contradiction that there were some algebra a v such that 24 w w a w p is not a regular suborder of p fix some transitive sized closed models h and h such that h h h h h a p because is weakly compact there is some transitive n and an elementary j h n with critical point because h h crit j and h h then 25 j h n note also that p h h and that p h h because h is closed and h h define 26 u x h p p h j h j x then u is an ultrafilter on h p p h which is closed in v and normal with respect to sequences from h i e if f h is a regressive function on some z u then there is a z u on which f is constant 16 claim 50 1 let z be the set of w h p h which satisfy clause 4 of the assumptions of theorem 48 then z u proof of claim 50 1 first note that z is an element of h because p h suppose for a contradiction that z u then because z h and u is an ultrafilter on h p p h there are u many w such that clause 4 fails for some w that is u many w such that w w pw v w p w pw v w p w q w w g w is not a regular suborder of q w 15 notice again this is a weaker assumption than requiring p to force that q is cc though in the end that will be true as well 16 it is not really necessary to work with both h and h here we could really use v in place of the h and work with the ultrafilter on h p derived from j rather than the ultrafilter on h p p h derived from j then make an argument at the end involving skolem hulls of we use h merely so that the u measure one sets concentrate directly on the kinds of model described in theorem 48 so we can directly apply that theorem after the following claim layered posets and kunen s universal collapse 25 notice that the map w 7 w pw is regressive and also an element of h so by normality of u with respect to regressive functions from h there is some fixed and a fixed p v p such that for u many w p v p q w g is not a regular suborder of q let a denote the set of such w so a u i e j h j a notice that a h it is definable from the regressive function and p let g be generic over v for v p with p g because p g it follows that 27 w a q w g is not a regular suborder of q where q is the evaluation of q by g because v p v then j lifts in v g to an elementary j h g n g n j g because h is closed in v and g is generic for a cc poset in fact a poset of size then h g is closed in v g and in particular in n g since also q is cc in v g and thus in n g then 28 n g and h g have the same maximal antichains of q then h g j h g n g and q satisfy the assumptions of lemma 40 note we are using here that j h n to conclude that j h g j h g n g so by lemma 40 29 j h g j q is a regular suborder of j q because j h j h j a j a and j g g then by 29 we get n g x j a x j g j q is a regular suborder of j q by elementarity of j then h g x a x g q is a regular suborder of q which contradicts 27 and completes the proof of claim 50 1 let b be the u set given by claim 50 1 because b u then h b is stationary in p h and because h h then b really is stationary in p h by theorem 48 p is layered a e on b thus p is stationarily layered remark 51 if the in the assumptions of theorem 50 is measurable and u is any normal ultrafilter on then essentially the same proof shows that p is layered on a u measure one set i e there are u many such that v p is a regular suborder of p i e u many active 6 applications in this section we use our main iteration result theorem 50 to prove theorems 7 and 9 a few remarks are in order first 1 the special case where in the conclusion of theorem 7 follows easily from kunen s original argument 17 without having to use our new the orem 50 the reason that the case is significantly easier is because of the solovay tennenbaum theorem 1 about finite support iterations 26 sean d cox 2 similarly the special case of theorem 9 could have easily been proven using kunen s original construction together with kanamori s theorem 57 below without having to use our new theorem 50 the reason again is that in this particular case i e when becomes 1 finite support iterations are used and so the solovay tennenbaumtheorem 1 is applicable 3 certain specific instances of theorem 7 were already known for arbitrary e g such as when the poset s h r from the statement of theorem 7 is the poset col 17 and certain other collapsing type posets the examples listed in corollary 8 are all new however and the template pro vided by theorem 7 for absorbing posets into quotients of saturated ideals is very general 6 1 proof of theorem 7 fix as in the statement of the theorem as sume j v n is a huge embedding with critical point let j assume is a regular cardinal and define a support universal kunen iteration p q as in definition 44 as follows p 0 is col for active i e if v p is a regular suborder of p the v p name that we force with is the following poset assuming that in v v p q csilv s h r v g where g is the v p name for its generic object csilv is the silver collapse see section 3 2 that turns into and r is some v p c silv name for a parameter which witnesses the analogue of 1 from the statement of theorem 7 note that from the point of view of the model v g csilv the poset s h r satisfies the assumptions of theorem 7 it is routine to verify that v p q is cc closed and has size then by theorem 50 it follows that 30 p p is cc and lemma 47 ensures that p is closed because p 0 collapses all cardinals between and these facts together imply 31 p for reasons that will be discussed in section 6 1 3 we will primarily work with the almost huge embedding j u v n u derived from j as in fact 25 rather than the huge embedding j though j will play a key role let k n u n be the map from fact 25 and recall from fact 25 that crit k n u recall j by 30 and lemma 46 it follows that is an active stage of j u p let g be v p generic then by the definition of the iteration combined with 31 stage of the j u p iteration forces with the following poset 32 csilv s h j u r n u g 17 equivalently the support product of many copies of col layered posets and kunen s universal collapse 27 because n u is closed in v and g is generic for a cc poset then n u g is closed in v g in particular v g and n u g have the same sequences and hence csilv is computed the same in v g and n u g let h be v g csilv generic and consider the evaluation of the 2 nd step of 32 i e the poset s h r n u g h where r is the evaluation of j u r byg h so r is a parameter in h n u g h h n u g h now we recall the assumptions about the parameter r namely n u g h s h r z h h z r is a closed cc poset of size at most 33 this implies that s h r n u g h is actually an element of h n u g h and that h n u g h s h r n u g h is a closed cc poset of size at most 34 let s s h r n u g h by the definition of j u p there is an n u such that p c silv s j u p is a regular embedding and is the identity on p by theorem 26 in v g h there is a normal ideal i j u on such that 35 i j u is forcing equivalent to j u p g h by standard arguments involving quotient forcings the map can be used to show that the poset s s v g h is absorbed as a regular suborder of j u p g h combining this with 35 yields 36 v g h there is a regular embedding e s ro i j u where ro denotes the boolean completion remark 52 regarding the ro appearing in 36 below we will show that in fact i j u is saturated which implies by fact 27 that i j u is a complete boolean algebra i e that i j u is isomorphic to not just densely embeddable into the complete boolean algebra ro i j u so the ro in 36 will ultimately be redundant remark 53 using the duality theorey from foreman 7 it can be arranged that the regular embedding e from 36 has the following additional property that whenever k is v g h i j u generic and jk v g h ult v g h k is the generic ultrapower map then e 1 k is an element of ult v g h k although k will never be an element of ult v g h k however we choose not to include this additional feature in the theorem in order to avoid lengthy detours into duality theory now it remains to prove the following two claims claim 54 the ideal i j u is saturated i e v g h i j u is cc 28 sean d cox claim 55 the poset s which recall is the poset s h r n u g h which was defined in n u g h has the required definability properties from the point of view of v g h in other words it remains to prove that the following holds from the point of view of v g h s z h v g h h v g h r z and s is a closed cc poset of size at most remark 56 the equality s z h v g h h v g h r z from claim 55 does not follow automatically from 33 because v g h v n u n u g h where the inequality is by fact 25 we seem to need some additional assumption such as the huge embedding used in the argument below we will use the huge embedding j to help prove claims 54 and 55 let k n u n be the map from fact 25 recall that 37 crit k n u n u g h 6 1 1 proof of claim 54 by 35 proving claim 54 is equivalent to showing that v g h the poset j u p g h is cc by fact 21 in turn it suffices to prove that v the poset j u p is cc but because j u p j u v v n u then by 37 the map k n u n fixes j u p also because p is cc in v then j u p is cc in n u then by elementarity of k k j u p j u p is k cc from the point of view of n because n is closed under sequences in v it follows that j u p is really cc in v as well which completes the proof 6 1 2 proof of claim 55 first note that k lifts to an elementary k n u g h n g h because g h is generic for a poset which is a subset of v n u and crit k because s h n u g h and crit k then k s s similarly because r h n u g h then k r r then by 33 and elementarity of k it follows that n g h k s s z h n g h h n g h z r and this poset is closed cc and of size 38 because the relation is absolute 38 implies 39 v g h s z h n g h h n g h z r because n is closed under sequences and g h is generic for a cc poset n g h is closed under sequences in v g h in particular v g h n g h and 40 h v g h h v g h h n g h h n g h thus by substituting into 39 we obtain 41 v g h s z h v g h h v g h z r layered posets and kunen s universal collapse 29 this shows that s indeed has the correct definition from the point of view of v g h finally because n g h is closed in v g h the fact that n g h believes s is closed cc and of size is upward absolute to v g h 6 1 3 a remark about the use of the huge embedding a remark is in order regarding why we insisted on using the almost huge embedding j u rather than the huge embedding j to construct the saturated ideal i j u in the proof of theorem 7 it certainly is possible to use liftings of the huge embedding j together with a pseudo generic tower construction to define a saturated ideal i j on this was kunen s original argument however that argument relied on the coarse fact that there exists an incompatibility preserving embedding i from i j into the cc poset p j p g h j u p g h which guarantees that i j is cc i e that i j is saturated however it is not clear if the map i is a dense embedding or even a regular embedding so in particular it is not clear if s which is a regular suborder of p can be regularly embedded into i j on the other hand i j u is forcing equivalent to p and thus absorbs s as a regular suborder which is why we worked with i j u instead of i j nonetheless the map j played an important background role in the proofs of claims 54 and 55 6 2 proof of theorem 9 now we proceed to the proof of theorem 9 for regular cardinals let sacks denote the support iteration of length which uses sacks at each step see definition 22 for the definition of sacks we use the following theorem of kanamori which generalizes a theorem from baumgartner laver 2 theorem 57 kanamori 15 suppose are regular uncountable is weakly compact and holds then the support iteration of length of sacks is cc and forces the following the tree property holds at for regular let sacks denote the support iteration r q where q 0 add and q sacks r for all 0 it is a standard fact that add forces so by theorem 57 it follows that corollary 58 if are regular uncountable and is weakly compact then sacks is cc and forces that and the tree property holds at assume j v n is a huge embedding with crit j and j fix a regular define a support universal kunen iteration p q as in definition 44 as follows p 0 is col for active i e if v p is a regular suborder of p the v p name that we force with is the following poset q sacks v g 30 sean d cox where g is the v p name for its generic object note that if and g is generic for v p then is still weakly compact in v g because g is generic for a sized poset and so by corollary 58 it follows that v p q is cc and forces tp by theorem 50 p p is cc then by lemma 46 it follows that is an active stage of j p moreover because p 0 collapses all cardinals in the interval and each q is forced to be closed then in v p let g be v p generic then stage of the j p iteration forces with the following poset 42 sacks n g so there is an e n g such that e sacks n g j p g is a regular embedding because n is closed under sequences in v really all we need for this part is that it is closed under sequences it follows that 43 q sacks v g sacks n g note that from the point of view of v g the poset q is a length support iteration of directed closed posets where the poset at each step has size that each step is directed closed follows from lemma 24 let k be generic over v g for the poset q then by corollary 58 in v g k the tree property holds at also v g k because p forces and q is directed closed also is still a cardinal by lemma 47 it remains to prove that v g k let g be generic over v g k for j p g e k then in v g the map j lifts to j v g n g we want to further lift j to domain v g k in some forcing extension note in particular that k n g because e n g and k e 1 g since n is closed under sequences and j p is cc it follows that n g is closed under sequences from v g in particular j a n g for every a v g of size so the map j v g n g and the iteration q satisfy the requirements of the following lemma with v g playing the role of w and n g playing the role of w lemma 59 implicit in kunen 17 suppose j w w is a possibly external elementary embedding with critical point let j and assume that is inaccessible in w suppose q q r is a support iteration in w such that 44 wq r is directed closed and of size assume that the iteration q is also an element of w that 45 a w v j a w layered posets and kunen s universal collapse 31 and that there exists some k w which is w q generic then there is a condition mk j q such that if k is w j q generic and mk k then j k k and thus j can be lifted to j w k w k w k proof the master condition mk will essentially be the condition with support j such that for each the j th component of mk is a lower bound for the pointwise image of the th component of k this is possible because each component of the iteration is of size and the image of the components of the iteration are directed closed more precisely we will recursively define a sequence m m and inductively verify that 1 m j q and has support exactly j 2 whenever then m m j 3 if k j is generic for j q over w and m k j then j k k j and thus j lifts to an embedding j w k w k j the recursion goes as follows if is a limit ordinal then m is simply the union of the m for if is a successor ordinal say 1 then we define m 1 as m j k where k is the j q name defined conditionally as follows here k j denotes the j q name for its generic object if m k j then k is the trivial condition of j r if m k j then let j w k w k j denote the lifting which is guaranteed by the induction hypothesis let h be the th component of k i e h r k r k 1 r k notice that h w because k w because r k has size and j is elementary then j h is a directed set of conditions of size in the model w k j and because r k is directed closed in w k j then j h has a lower bound let k be any such lower bound for j h it is now routine to verify the inductive assumptions note that m has support j which is acceptable because j q is a support iteration and j finally we prove that w k in w k fix a structure a in a countable language let k be w j q generic with mk k and let j w k w k be the lifting of j elementarity of j ensures that j j j a moreover j w and w k believes that j j j and that j j so w k x j a x j j and x j 32 sean d cox so by elementarity of j w k x a x and x which completes the proof remark 60 the model just constructed actually has a saturated ideal on z z this can be proved using the pseudogeneric tower argument from kunen 17 which is described in detail in foreman 7 7 questions question 61 suppose we alter the assumptions of theorem 50 as follows weaken the large cardinal assumption e g only assume that is mahlo strengthen the assumptions on q by requiring them to be knaster in stead of merely cc more precisely assume that for all active that v p q is knaster can we conclude that p has the cc note that if p is a finite support iteration then the answer is yes remark 56 in the proof of theorem 7 raises the following question question 62 is theorem 7 still true if is merely assumed to be almost huge in v references 1 james e baumgartner iterated forcing surveys in set theory london math soc lecture note ser vol 87 cambridge univ press cambridge 1983 pp
