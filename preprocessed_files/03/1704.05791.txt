in the following sense every normal ideal and every tower of normal ideals of inaccessible height is a canonical rudin keisler projection of the restriction of ns to some stationary set we investigate how far burke s theorem can be pushed by analyzing the universality properties of ns with re spect to the wider class of c systems of filters introduced by audrito steila 1 first we answer a question of 1 by proving that c systems of filters do not capture all kinds of set generic embeddings we provide a characterization of supercompactness in terms of short extenders and canonical projections of ns without any reference to the strength of the extenders as a corollary ns can consistently fail to canonically project to arbitrarily strong short extenders we prove that cofinal towers of normal ultrafilters e g the kind used to characterize i 2 and i 3 embeddings are well founded if and only if they are canonical projections of ns finally we provide a characterization of is jonsson in terms of canonical projections of ns contents 1 introduction 1 2 canonical projections of ns 3 3 a question of audrito steila 10 4 a characterization of supercompactness in terms of short extenders 12 5 i 3

ideals theorem 1 1 burke 2 if i is a normal fine countably complete ideal or a tower of such ideals of inaccessible height then there exists a stationary set si such that i is the canonical projection of the generalized nonstationary ideal restricted to si denoted ns si 2010 mathematics subject classification 03 e 55 03 e 35 the author gratefully acknowledges support from the vcu presidential research quest fund and thanks brent cody and monroe eskew for helpful conversations on topics related to the paper the author also is grateful to the anonymous referee for suggesting question 6 2 1 http arxiv org abs 1704 05791 v 3 2 sean d cox for example if i is a normal ideal on then there is some stationary si h 2 such that letting denote the map m 7 m defined on h 2 we have a i 1 a ns si this is true even if i is the dual of a supercompact measure on claverie 3 generalized the concept of ideals on regular cardinals to so called short ideal extenders this was further generalized by audrito steila 1 to c systems of filters which for technical reasons discussed in section 3 we will call normal systems of filters normal systems of filters encompass single ideals towers of ideals and ideal extenders into a single framework moreover their framework provides a natural extension of the notion of canonical projections of ideals roughly we say that a normal system f of filters is a canonical projection of ns if and only if there exists a stationary set s f such that f ns s f is a normal system of filters 1 in the case where f is the dual of a single ideal or tower of ideals this notion of canonical projection agrees with the usual notion used in burke s theorem this paper addresses how far burke s theorem 1 1 can be pushed namely question 1 2 which normal systems of filters are canonical projections of ns unlike burke s theorem 1 1 the answer to question 1 2 depends on the normal system of filters in question and on the ambient large cardinals in the universe the following list summarizes our main results regarding question 1 2 1 a cardinal is supercompact if and only if there are class many such that there exists a short extender that is a canonical projection of ns in particular if is strong but not supercompact then there are arbi trarily strong short extenders with critical point that are not canonical projections of ns one interesting feature of this characterization of super compactness is that it makes no reference to the strength of the extenders see section 4 2 every precipitous cofinal tower of normal ideals is a canonical projection of ns moreover for cofinal towers of normal ultrafilters being a canoni cal projection of ns exactly characterizes having a wellfounded ultrapower in particular i 2 embeddings can be characterized by so called i 3 towers that happen to be canonical projections of ns see section 5 3 if 2 then is jonsson if and only if there exists an i 2 tower of normal ideals that is a canonical projection of ns and decides its critical sequence this extends an old theorem of silver see section 5 we also answer a question of audrito steila 1 by proving that normal systems of filters do not capture all kinds of set generic embeddings this appears in section 3 all terminology and notation agrees with jech 9 unless otherwise indicated by ideal we will always mean a fine countably complete ideal but not necessarily normal the support of an ideal i is the set s where s is any i positive set 2 if 1 see section 2 for the precise definitions of normal system of filters and canonical projections of ns 2 since i is fine this does not depend on the choice of s e g if i is an ideal on h then the support of i is h and h s where s is any i positive set on the universality of the nonstationary ideal 3 i is an ideal on a set z then bi denotes the quotient boolean algebra z i i a set s is stationary iff for every f s s there is some m s that is closed under f if s is a stationary set the nonstationary ideal restricted to s denoted ns s is the ideal generated by s cf f s s where cf x s x is closed under f 2 canonical projections of ns the notion of one normal ideal canonically projecting to another or of a nor mal ideal projecting to a tower of normal ideals has appeared many times in the literature e g foreman 6 and burke 2 for concreteness suppose j is a normal ideal with support j i is a normal ideal with support i and j i we say that j is the canonical projection of i to j iff letting i j denote the map m 7 m j we have j a j 1 a i it will be illustrative to give an alternative characterization j is the canonical projection of i iff for all a j 1 a j bi jg j jg a where j g is the bi name for its generic ultrapower embedding similarly i projects to a tower j j iff i projects to every j but what should it mean for a normal ideal i to project to an ideal extender ja a i which looks very different from a tower of normal ideals 3 roughly we will define this to mean that j is derived from i s generic ultrapower embeddings in the following way that for all a i 2 x ja bi a jg x where j g is the bi name for the generic ultrapower embedding although 2 seems vaguely similar to 1 to see that it really is the same phenomenon we will use a notion of audrito steila 1 which they call c systems of filters which elegantly unifies normal ideals towers of normal ideals and ideal extenders into a single framework a set c is called a directed set of domains iff c is closed under subsets and finite unions and c is transitive for each a c oa m a m m trcl a m is extensional where m denotes the mostowski collapsing map ofm if a b then b a ob oa is defined by f 7 f a a directed system of filters with domain c is a sequence f fa a c such that c is a directed set of domains each fa oa is a filter and whenever a b are both in c then fa is the canonical projection of fb via b a i e for all a oa a fa 1 b a a fb 3 in fact many ja in the ideal extender are typically not normal ideals even if the entire ideal extender satisfies the so called normality criterion for extenders 4 sean d cox if f is a directed system of filters with domain c the poset associated with f denoted b f is the partial order whose conditions are pairs a s where a c and s f a i e s oa and s dual fa the ordering of b f is a s b t iff 1 a b a s fa b 1 a b b t where x f y means x y is in the dual ideal of f if g is v b f generic then for each a c the object ga s oa a s g is an ultrafilter on v oa extending fa hence it makes sense to form the ultra power map jga v ult v ga and if a b are both in c then b a gives rise to an elementary embedding ka b ult v ga ult v gb such that jgb ka b jga since c is directed in v g the ultrapowers of v by the various ga s gives rise to a directed system and an ultrapower map jg v ult v g where the target ult v g is the direct limit of the ult v ga s the map jg is called the generic ultrapower map for f definition 2 6 of audrito steila 1 imposes an additional normality require ment of directed systems of filters resulting in what they call a c system of filters which is the main focus of their paper rather than describing their some what complicated normality criterion 4 we choose instead to give an equivalent definition that will be more convenient for our applications also because we will often be viewing one such system as a projection of another e g viewing some system f fa a c f as a projection of another system h ha a c h it would lead to confusion if we referred to both of them as c systems of filters since c f and c h will differ therefore what audrito steila call a c system of filters we will instead call a normal system of filters definition 2 1 a normal system of filters is a sequence f fa a c such that 1 c is a directed set of domains and f is a directed system of filters with domain c as defined above 2 b f forces c to be a subset of the wellfounded part of ult v g 5 3 for all a c and all d oa d fa b f j g a 1 j g d the following lemma follows directly from proposition 2 24 of 1 lemma 2 2 a sequence f is a normal system of filters as in definition 2 1 if and only if f is a c system of filters as in definition 2 1 of audrito steila 1 normal systems of filters unify several commonly used notions that typically have very different representations the following is our official definition of ideal extenders normal towers and normal ideals though as noted below we will often switch to other more traditional representations definition 2 3 audrito steila 1 let f fa a c be a normal system of filters with domain c then f is called 4 i e requirement 4 of definition 2 6 of 1 5 where we require that the wellfounded part of ult v g has been transitivized on the universality of the nonstationary ideal 5 an ideal extender if c for some ordinal an extender is an ideal extender where every fa is an ultrafilter a normal tower if c v for some a normal ideal if c has a largest element equivalently 6 c x for some transitive set x 7 as pointed out in section 2 1 of 1 these notions agree with the standard def initions via the following correspondences a single normal ideal i with tran sitive support x in the usual sense corresponds to a normal system of filters f ia a x where f ix m m d d dual i and for each a x f ia is the dual of the canonical projection of i to oa via the function x a here m denotes the mostowski collapsing map of m of course the entire system here is generated by the single filter fx which is essentially the dual of the original ideal i if f is an ideal extender in the sense of definition 2 3 then ea a is an ideal extender in the sense of claverie 3 where ea rng f f d and rng f a a d fa and a is the cardinality of the smallest fa measure one set we will call e the claverie style representation of f moreover the claverie style forcing asso ciated with e is equivalent to b f and the generic ultrapower maps are identical conversely if ea a is an ideal extender in the sense of claverie 3 then one can use the claverie style forcing b e associated with e which forces a generic embedding with contained in the wellfounded part of the generic ultrapower to define a sequence f fa a by x fa iff x oa and b e jh a 1 j h x where j h is the b e name for the generic ultrapower map then b f is forcing equivalent to b e and their generic ultrapowers are the same similarly normal towers in the sense of definition 2 3 and normal towers in the classic sense e g as in 6 can be put into correspondence as follows if f fa a v is a tower as in definition 2 3 then ea a v is a normal tower in the classic sense where ea dom f f d d fa conversely if e ea a v is a normal tower as in 6 then f fa a v is a normal tower in the sense of definition 2 3 where fa m m d d fa 6 because directed sets of domains by definition are required to be closed under subsets 7 the transitivity requirement is not a real restriction because any ideal is isomorphic to an ideal with transitive support 6 sean d cox and m denotes the transitive collapsing map ofm alternatively one could instead use the classic generic ultrapower by the tower e in order to define f similarly to how it was done for ideal extenders definition 2 4 given normal systems of filters f and h we write f h and say f canonically projects to h iff f extends h i e f dom h h we write f h and say that f is equivalent to h as normal systems of filters iff there exists an isomorphism ro b f ro b h such that whenever g is generic for b f then jg j g and ult v g ult v g this is clearly an equivalence relation in the case where f and h are both normal ideals or normal towers the notion of canonical projection from definition 2 4 agrees with the usual notion of canonical ideal projection modulo the different representation of normal ideals and normal towers described above the main new content of definition 2 4 is when the system being projected to i e the h in the definition is neither a normal ideal nor a tower of normal ideals for example we will often be interested in cases where the f from definition 2 4 is a normal ideal but the h from definition 2 4 is an ideal extender we remark that it is possible to have f h while h f for example suppose f is just a normal measure on one can then derive an extender of any length desired from j f and this extender will be equivalent to f yet its domain will properly extend the domain of f because of the correspondences described immediately after definition 2 3 for convenience we will often switch between different representations as in the follow ing convention convention 2 5 given a normal ideal i with transitive support x and a normal system of filters f when we write i f it is understood that we are representing i as the normal system of filters eia a x as described above so by i f we really mean eia a x f definition 2 6 let f be a normal system of filters we say that f is a canonical projection of ns iff there exists some stationary set s such that ns s f as in convention 2 5 definition 2 7 given any class of normal systems of filters we say that ns is universal for iff every member of is a canonical projection of ns then burke s theorem 1 1 can be rephrased as ns is universal for the class of all normal ideals and normal towers of inaccessible height on the universality of the nonstationary ideal 7 as with burke s argument for theorem 1 1 it will be convenient to be able to characterize definition 2 6 in terms of good structures as introduced by foreman magidor 7 we also generalize self genericity to such systems definition 2 8 given a normal system f fa a c of filters and some m h f where f h let m hm h be the inverse of the mostowski collapse map of m for each b m we let bm denote 1 m b for each a m c let um a x hm oa m 1 m a m x and let um um a a m c we say that m is f good iff um pointwise extends the system f m i e iff um a fa m for every a m c m is f self generic iff um is generic over hm for the poset b f m where b f is the forcing associated with f as described before definition 2 1 it is routine to check that m is f good iff for all a m c and all d m fa m a d m is f self generic iff for every a m that is a maximal antichain in b f there is some a s a m such that m a s the following technical fact will be used in section 4 fact 2 9 suppose f is an ideal extender with critical point and m h f is f good then m proof suppose not then letting m be the least element of m that is not a subset of m we have m and 3 m m m where m is the mostowski collapsing map of m let c m m i e c is the singleton whose only element is the function with domain m that sends m to itself note that c m since is the critical point of f and m the generic ultrapower always fixes m so b f jg m 1 m m jg c c this implies that c f m since both c and m are in m and m is f good then m m c i e m fixes m this contradicts 3 if u is a normal system of ultrafilters and m h u then b u and thus its preimage under m is the trivial forcing it follows that observation 2 10 suppose u is a normal system of ultrafilters then for any m h u m is u good if and only if m is u self generic the next observation will be used in section 4 observation 2 11 suppose u is a normal system of ultrafilters and that m h u is u good then u m i e the normal system derived from m as in definition 2 8 is an element of hm 8 sean d cox proof let um 1 m u where m hm h is the inverse of the mostowski collapse ofm we prove that um u m pick any a m c and let am 1 m a now both umam and um am are ultrafilters on hm oam so to prove they are equal it suffices to show that one of them extends the other and umam extends um am because m is u good next we generalize foreman s 6 construction of the conditional club filter relative to a normal ideal where we replace the normal ideal by any normal system of filters the main new content of this definition is when the normal system of filters is an ideal extender the following notation is the appropriate analogue of the notation of feng jech 5 in the current setting definition 2 12 given a collection r of elementary submodels of some h and given sets a and t set r a t m r m a t where m denotes the transitive collapsing map of m definition 2 13 given a normal system f fa a c of filters and a collection r of elementary submodels of some h we say that r is f projective stationary iff for every a c and every t f a the set r a t as defined in definition 2 12 is stationary lemma 2 14 let f fa a c be a normal system of filters the following are equivalent 1 there exists some normal ideal i such that i f as in convention 2 5 2 f is a canonical projection of ns as in definition 2 6 3 for all sufficiently large the set of f good substructures of h is f projective stationary moreover if each fa is an ultrafilter then replacing f projective stationary in item 3 with stationary results in an equivalent statement proof 2 implies 1 because the nonstationary ideal is normal to see that 1 implies 2 given a normal i such that i f let si be the stationary set from burke s theorem such that ns si i the relation in definition 2 4 is clearly transitive so ns si f next we prove 2 3 let s be the stationary set witnessing 2 i e so that ns s projects canonically to f by lifting stationary sets if necessary we can wlog assume that s is a stationary collection of elementary substructures of some h identifying ns s as a normal system of filters with largest member fh m m c c dual ns s as described after definition 2 3 we can translate assumption 2 as follows a c d oa d fa 1 h a d fh m m s and m a d fh m s m a d dual ns s s a d dual ns s 4 on the universality of the nonstationary ideal 9 let r denote the collection of f good members of s let a c and t f a we need to prove that r a t is stationary now s a t is a stationary subset of s by 4 so to finish the proof it suffices to prove that s r is nonstationary suppose toward a contradiction that s r is stationary then for stationarily many m s there is a pair am dm m c fam such that m am dm then by fodor s lemma there is a stationary s s and some fixed a d c fa such that 5 m a d for all m s since d fa by 4 we have d m s m a d dual ns s but 5 implies d s contradicting that s is a stationary subset of s finally we prove 3 2 let s denote the set of f good elementary substruc tures of h and again identify ns s with a normal system with largest member fh we need to prove that a c d oa d fa 1 h a d fh which by the same argument as 4 is equivalent to proving a c d oa d fa s a d dual ns s so fix some a c and some d oa if d fa then for every m s with a d m we have m a d by definition of goodness this collection constitutes a measure one set in ns s if d fa then d c f a so assumption 3 ensures there are stationarily many m s such that m a d c so s a d c m s m a d c is stationary and hence the complement of s a d c i e s a d is not in the dual filter of ns s for the moreover part let r denote the set of f good elementary substruc tures ofh and assume thatr is stationary we need to prove thatr is f projective stationary so let a c and t f a since fa is an ultrafilter then in fact t fa there are stationarily many m r such that a t m and since any such m is f good and t fa then m a t it will be convenient to see how definition 2 4 translates into the setting where we view ideal extenders in the claverie 3 form definition 2 15 let f fa a be an ideal extender as in definition 2 3 with critical point and e ea a be its claverie style representa tion as described after definition 2 3 8 let m h e and m hm h be the inverse of the mostowski collapse of m we say m is e good iff the clas sic m m extender u m derived from m extends the system 1 m e in other words m is e good iff x hm a m x 1 m ea for every a m 8 so in particular each ea is a filter on a a where a is the minimum cardinality of a set in ea 10 sean d cox the following lemmas are routine to check and we leave the proofs to the inter ested reader lemma 2 16 let f be an ideal extender as in definition 2 3 and e be its equiva lent claverie style representation given any m h f m is f good in the sense of definition 2 8 if and only if m is e good in the sense of definition 2 15 lemma 2 17 let i be a normal ideal f an ideal extender as in definition 2 3 and e ea a the claverie style representation of f the following are equivalent 1 i f following convention 2 5 2 for all a ea x a bi a jg x 3 a question of audrito steila audrito steila 1 call attention to the following concepts see definition 3 2 of 1 given a first order property p j in the language j where j is a predicate symbol we say that has generically property p iff in some generic extension v g of v there is a definable elementary embedding j with domain v and critical point such that v g j p j they say that has ideally property p iff there exists some normal system of filters f with critical point such that b f the generic ultrapower embedding has property p they asked question 3 1 question 4 4 of 1 is having ideally property p equivalent to having generically property p question 3 1 was apparently motivated by claverie s 3 distinction between ide ally strong and generically strong cardinals we prove that the answer to ques tion 3 1 is no given a possibly external elementary embedding j v n we say that j is eventually continuous iff there exists some such that for all with cfv j is continuous at 9 theorem 3 2 let p j stand for j is a nontrivial elementary embedding and is not eventually continuous it is consistent relative to a proper class of measurable cardinals that p generically holds but does not ideally hold proof let v be a model of zfc and ui i i ord be a definable class such that i i ord is an increasing sequence of measurable cardinals and ui is a normal measure on i for each i ord for example this can be arranged if v has a definable wellorder of the universe and has class many measurable cardinals e g it holds for the core model below 0 sword from 14 in fact that model has exactly one normal measure on each measurable cardinal then there is an elementary embedding j v n with n wellfounded that is definable in v and is not eventually continuous there are many ways to construct such a j but for example define an iteration ni i k i k ord as follows n 0 v and 0 0 id 9 i e sup j j on the universality of the nonstationary ideal 11 if ni and k i are defined for all k i then ni 1 ult ni 0 i ui if i is a limit ordinal or if i ord then ni and k i for k i are defined to be the direct limit then 0 ord v nord is definable in v because it is definable from u and we are assuming that u is definable in v for every i ord ni is wellfounded by theorem 19 30 of 9 it follows that the membership relation of nord is also wellfounded and as usual we may without loss of generality assume that n transord y nord the nord transitive closure of y is a set is transitive the construction of the iteration ensures that 6 i j both in ord crit i j 0 i i and it follows that 7 i ord crit i ord 0 i i to prove that n transord is in fact all of nord it suffices to check that an arbitrary nord ordinal y is an element of ord pick i ord such that y rng i ord and let yi 1 i ord y pick a limit ord such that i and 0 i yi then applying i to both sides yields that 0 i yi 1 ord y since the critical point of ord is 0 by 7 it follows that y 1 ord y ordn ord finally note that for each i ord 0 ord is discontinuous at i because 0 ord i ord 0 i and crit i ord 0 i i by 7 since each i is measurable and hence regular it follows that 0 ord is not eventually continuous so 0 ord and the trivial forcing witness that p generically holds on the other hand suppose for a contradiction that p ideally holds then there is some nor mal system of filters f and some generic g for b f such that v g believes that the generic ultrapower j v n has property p by theorem 2 37 of audrito steila 1 the generic ultrapower j v n can be viewed as an extender embed ding in v g that is for a sufficiently large we have n j f s s and f v s v then the following standard argument shows that j is continuous on cofv contradicting that p j holds assume cfv and let j f s j where f v s v and s without loss of generality we can assume that rng f since cfv then sup rng f and hence j sup rng f j then j f s sup rng j f j sup rng f j so there is an element of range j in the interval j f s j which completes the proof 12 sean d cox 4 a characterization of supercompactness in terms of short extenders in this section we provide a characterization of supercompactness in terms of short extenders theorem 4 2 this characterization allows us to show that ns is not necessarily universal for the class of all wellfounded extenders corollary 4 3 one interesting feature of theorem 4 2 is that the characterization makes no reference to the strength of the extenders 10 we will use the following characterization of supercompactness due to magidor theorem 4 1 magidor 12 see viale 13 for the formulation presented here the following are equivalent for a regular uncountable cardinal 1 is supercompact 2 for class many there are stationarily many m h such that m and m collapses to a hereditary initial segment of the universe 11 theorem 4 2 the following are equivalent 1 is supercompact 2 for class many there exists a short extender that is a canonical projection of ns proof assume first that is supercompact given let u be a normal fine measure on and let j v u n be the ultrapower embedding let f be the extender derived from j i e for each a x fa a j x then u f by lemma 2 17 so by 2 14 f is a canonical projection of u since j then f is a short extender i e each fa concentrates on a by burke s theorem 1 1 u is a canonical projection of ns su good clearly the relation x is the canonical projection of y as in definition 2 4 is transitive so f is the canonical projection of ns su good now assume 2 by magidor s theorem 4 1 it suffices to prove that for all regular there are stationarily manym h such that m otp m ord is a cardinal and m collapses to a hereditary initial segment of the universe fix a regular and an algebra a on h by 2 there is a 2 and a short extender f that is a canonical projection of ns by lemma 2 14 the set s f good of f good structures is stationary in h fix any f good m such that m h a f let m hm m h be the inverse of the mostowski collapse of m and m 1 m note that m m h a and that 1 m h 1 m m h m hm is the transitive collapse of m now by fact 2 9 m we will prove that 8 hm m v m 10 recall the strength of an extender f is defined to be the largest ordinal such that v ult v f 11 i e otp m ord is a cardinal and the transitive collapse of m is hotp m ord on the universality of the nonstationary ideal 13 which will imply that otp m ord ht hm is a cardinal in v and that h m hm h m v sincem is f good then by observation 2 11 the 1 m 1 m extender fm derived from m is an element of hm let h m ult hm fm and km h m h the canonical factor map so that m km j fm note that since fm hm then the ultrapower map j fm is internal to hm so in particular 9 hm h m since fm has length m 1 m then crit km m also because 2 then by elementarity of m 2 m hm m and by 9 it follows that 2 m h m m putting all this together we have 2 m h m crit km which implies that 10 h m m h m v m putting 10 and 9 together yields 8 and completes the proof corollary 4 3 suppose is strong but not supercompact then for class many there is a short extender with critical point and strength that is not a canonical projection of ns proof since is not supercompact then by magidor s theorem 4 1 there is some regular such that there are only nonstationarily many m v such that m and m collapses to a hereditary initial segment of the universe let a denote this nonstationary set let 2 since is strong there exists a short extender f with critical point and strength and without loss of generality the length of f is at least by the proof of the 2 1 direction of theorem 4 2 if f were a canonical projection of ns then a would be stationary which is a contradiction 5 i 3 towers and is jonsson if is a singular cardinal of cofinality i ix x v is a tower of ideals with domain v and n n is increasing and cofinal in then i is generated by iv n n because every x v is a subset in fact member of some v n x and ix is the canonical projection of iv n x to an ideal on x 12 for this reason to simplify notation we will often say things like suppose in n is a tower of height where it is understood that in iv n for some n n that is cofinal in this does not depend on the choice of the cofinal sequence since the sequences indexed by any two cofinal sequences in generate the same tower 12 moreover if is strong limit then one could just use i n instead of iv n i e in that scenario ix x v can be recovered from just i n n 14 sean d cox lemma 5 1 suppose n n is a strictly increasing sequence of cardinals with supremum and i in n is a tower of normal ideals of height where in is an ideal on v n suppose w is a set such that v w and w v f w w a function m and t i m fix any surjection v w with the property that n v n v n then there is a tree s i f m t of height such that the following are equivalent 1 there exists some m w such that m is i good m is closed under f and m v m t 2 there is a cofinal branch through s i f m t moreover this equivalence is absolute to any outer model proof for each n let wn v n let s i f m t be the collection of all finite sequences x 0 x 1 xk such that 1 xi wi for all i k 2 if m k then xm v m t 3 for all i j k a xi xj wi b xi v i xj v i c for all z xi if f z wj then f z xj d for all c wj dual ii xi v i c clearly s i f m t is closed under initial segments and is hence a tree if xn n is a cofinal branch then x n xn is closed under f the intersection of x with v m is in t and x is i good conversely if y w and y v m t y is closed under f and y is i good then y wn n is a cofinal branch through the tree the moreover part follows from absoluteness of wellfoundedness between tran sitive models of set theory together with the fact that for a given m the statement m is i good closed under f and m v m sprt im t is a 0 statement in the parameters m i f v m and t theorem 5 2 let i in n be an cofinal tower of normal ideals 1 if i is precipitous then it is a canonical projection of ns 2 if the dual of each in is an ultrafilter then i has wellfounded ultrapower is equivalent to i is a canonical projection of ns proof first fix a cofinal sequence n n of cardinals in so that by the convention mentioned earlier in iv n to prove part 1 suppose i is precipitous to prove that i is a canonical projec tion of ns by lemma 2 14 it suffices to prove that there are i projective stationarily on the universality of the nonstationary ideal 15 many i good substructures ofh for some sufficiently large i e for every t i there are stationarily many m h such that m t t and n c m dual in m sprt in c let n t be such that t v n t let a h be an algebra let be the height of i and fix some w a such that v w and w v fix a surjection v w as in the assumptions of lemma 5 1 set aw a w and for each n let wn v n fix a function f w w such that any subset of w closed under f is elementary in aw it suffices to find some i good subset of w that is closed under f and whose intersection with v n t sprt in t is in t let g be v b i generic with t g and j v n the generic ultrapower since i is precipitous then n is wellfounded then j v n t j t because t g in n consider the tree sj i j f n t j t j from lemma 5 1 from the point of view of v g every proper initial segment of the sequence b j wn n is an element of n because j sprt in j v n n for every n and moreover every proper initial segment of b is an element of the tree sj i j f nt j t j since n is wellfounded in v g and v g believes that the tree sj i j f nt j t j has a cofinal branch then by absoluteness there exists a cofinal branch in n by lemma 5 1 n believes there is a j i good set closed under j f whose intersection with j n t is in t by elementarity of j we are done with the proof of part 1 for part 2 assume u un n is an cofinal tower of normal ultrafilters if u has wellfounded ultrapower then it is a canonical projection of ns by part 1 now suppose u is a canonical projection of ns by lemma 2 14 there are sta tionarily many u good structures in h for sufficiently large fix some u good m h u and let m hm h be the inverse of the mostowski collapsing map of m by observation 2 11 the tower of ultrafilters um derived from m is the same as the preimage um 1 m u of u in hm since ult hm u m can always be embedded into h and is hence wellfounded then ult hm um is a well founded ultrapower that is internal to hm so hm um is wellfounded so by elementarity of m h m um u is wellfounded recall that an i 3 embedding is a nontrivial elementary embedding from v v for some an i 2 embedding is a nontrivial elementary embedding j v n where n is transitive and v n where is the supremum of the critical sequence 13 definition 5 3 we say that i is an i 3 tower iff it is an cofinal tower of normal ideals and b i forces that the critical sequence of the generic ultrapower is contained in and cofinal in ht i 14 an i 3 tower of ultrafilters is an i 3 tower such that the dual of every ideal in the tower is an ultrafilter 13 recall the critical sequences is defined inductively by setting 0 crit j and n 1 j n for all n 14 i e it is forced that crit j g ht i n j n crit j g ht i for every n and n n is cofinal in ht i 16 sean d cox it is straightforward to see that for a regular uncountable the following are equivalent 1 there exists an i 3 embedding with critical point 2 there exists an i 3 tower of ultrafilters with critical point the proof essentially appears in kanamori 10 but we provide a very brief sketch if j v v has critical point let be the supremum of the critical sequence n n then j v is an elementary embedding from v v for each n let un a v n j v n j a then u is an i 3 tower of ultrafilters of height conversely suppose u un n is an i 3 tower of ultrafilters of height with critical point let j v u n be the ultrapower of v by u then n is wellfounded below and by definition noting that b u is the trivial forcing the critical sequence is cofinal in it follows that j v is an elementary embedding from v v on the other hand i 3 towers which happen to be canonical projections of ns yield i 2 embeddings and vice versa theorem 5 4 let be regular uncountable the following are equivalent 1 is the critical point of some i 2 embedding 2 there exists an i 3 tower of ultrafilters of completeness with wellfounded ultrapower 3 there exists an i 3 tower of ultrafilters of completeness that is a canonical projection of ns proof the equivalence of 1 with 2 is standard see chapter 24 of kanamori 10 the equivalence of 2 with 3 follows from part 2 of theorem 5 2 although uncountably cofinal towers of ultrafilters always yield wellfounded ul trapowers this is not the case with cofinal towers of ultrafilters lemma 5 5 if there is an i 2 embedding then there is an i 3 tower of ultrafilters with illfounded ultrapower proof let be the least cardinal such that there exists a wellfounded i 2 embedding with critical point without loss of generality we may assume this embedding is an ultrapower by an i 3 tower of ultrafilters u un n let be the height of u and j v u n the ultrapower map where n is transitive then v n in n consider the tree s of all finite partial i 3 towers of ultrafilters in v with critical point ordered by extension every proper initial segment of u is an element of n and hence an element of s hence u is a cofinal branch through s and by absoluteness n believes there is a cofinal branch through s so n there exists an i 3 tower of ultrafilters with critical point since j then v believes there exists an i 3 tower of ultrafilters with critical point by minimality of this i 3 tower must be illfounded notice that if i is an i 3 tower of height then the requirement in definition 5 3 that the critical sequence is forced to be cofinal in v is redundant it follows already from the requirement that the critical sequence is forced to be contained in v to see this suppose g is b i generic over v jg v ng is the generic on the universality of the nonstationary ideal 17 ultrapower n n is the critical sequence and n n v then 0 crit jg is a cardinal in v and h v ng by basic properties of tower ultrapowers using the assumption that n n v an inductive proof then yields that n 1 jg n is a cardinal in both v and ng for every n it follows that v is the supremum of definition 5 6 given a normal system of filters f we say that f decides its critical sequence iff there is a sequence n n in the ground model such that b f forces to be the critical sequence of the generic ultrapower map the following lemma provides a characterization of i 3 towers that decide their critical sequence without referring to the forcing relation lemma 5 7 suppose is a singular cardinal of cofinality and i ix x v is a tower of ideals of height suppose n n is increasing and cofinal in the following are equivalent 1 i is an i 3 tower and decides its critical sequences as 2 i 0 is 0 complete and for every n 1 cn x n i 1 n otp x i i 1 dual i n proof for the 1 2 direction that i 0 is 0 complete follows easily from the assumption that 0 is forced to be the critical point of generic ultrapowers by i now fix n 1 let g be an arbitrary generic for b i and j v n the generic ultrapower then is the critical sequence of j by assumption then i 1 n j n j i j i and otp j i i 1 so j n j cn since g was arbitrary it follows that cn dual i n for the 2 1 direction assume g is b i generic over v and j v n is the generic ultrapower we just need to prove that is the critical sequence of j the background assumption that is cofinal in takes care of the remaining requirement of definition 5 3 first the 0 completeness of i 0 ensures that 0 crit j now c 1 dual i 1 so c 1 g hence j 1 j c 1 so j 1 has ordertype exactly 0 which implies the other inequality 0 crit j hence 11 crit j 0 and j 0 1 let n n enumerate the sequence j so 1 for every now for any n 1 since cn g then j n j cn so by the definition of j cn we have n 1 i 1 n otp j n i i 1 and it follows that j i 1 i for all i 1 equivalently that j 1 for every 1 together with 11 this yields that is the critical sequence of j silver proved the following theorem which we phrase in modern terminology theorem 5 8 silver see foreman magidor 8 assume 2 the following are equivalent only the 1 2 direction uses the assumption that 2 1 is jonsson 2 there exists some pair of sequences i i and i i both subsequences of the n s such that i cof i i 18 sean d cox is mutually stationary 15 we provide another characterization of is jonsson assuming 2 from which silver s theorem can be easily derived theorem 5 9 assume 2 the following are equivalent the assumption 2 is only used for the 1 2 direction 1 is jonsson 2 there exists an i 3 tower of height that decides its critical sequence and is a canonical projection of ns we will need a standard fact fact 5 10 suppose a is a skolemized structure extending h in a countable language and m a let be a cardinal below and m ska m then for all n such that n sup m n sup m n proof let n be such that n and suppose m n then f for some function f m and some ordinal then without loss of generality f n since n and f m then sup rng f m n and hence sup m n corollary 5 11 if 2 and is jonsson then for all there are stationarily many m h such that m m and m contains all the reals proof of theorem 5 9 first we prove the easier direction assume i is a tower as in part 2 and that n n is the critical sequence it decides note that must be a subsequence of the n s by the remarks above let be large and a an algebra on h we need to find some m a such that m but m without loss of generality a includes a predicate for the sequence cn n where cn is as defined in lemma 5 7 since we assume i is a canonical projection of ns by lemma 2 14 there is some m a that is i good since cn m for all n and m is i good then m n cn for all n this implies that i 1 otp m i i 1 so in particular i 1 cf sup m i i 1 this implies that m supi i 1 yet clearly there are gaps in m below in fact we ve just proved that the sequence i cof i 1 i 1 is mutually stationary i e part 2 of theorem 5 8 15 mutual stationarity was introduced in foreman magidor 8 in the current setting mutual stationarity of i cof i i means that for every f there exists some set x closed under f such that cf sup x i i for all i on the universality of the nonstationary ideal 19 for the direction 1 2 we assume 2 and that is jonsson fix a large regular and let s denote the set of jonsson subsets of h that include all the reals s is stationary by corollary 5 11 for each m s let m hm h be the inverse of the collapsing map of m then is a fixed point of m and hence the critical sequence mn n of m is a subset of also m m n 1 m n is a cardinal in v for every n 1 for each n 1 let kmn be the natural number such that mn kmn since m includes all the reals then sm k m n n 1 m and hence tm m n n 1 sm n n 1 m so the map m 7 tm is a regressive function on s by fodor s lemma there is a fixed t that is a subsequence of the n s and a stationary t s such that tm t for all m t notice also that since t m for m t it makes sense to apply 1 to t and it easily follows that m t mn n hm let i be the projection of ns t to a tower of height more precisely for n 1 let in be the projection of ns t to an ideal on v n where n n 1 is the increasing enumeration of t starting at 1 note that 12 m t n 1 mn n clearly i is a tower and is a canonical projection of ns by definition it remains to prove that it is an i 3 tower and that it decides its critical sequence by lemma 5 7 it suffices to prove that i 1 is 1 complete and that n 2 x n i 2 n otp x i i 1 dual in which in turn by definition of ideal projection is equivalent to proving that the following holds for all n 2 m t m 1 1 and i 2 n otp m i i 1 dual ns t but in fact for every m t m 1 1 because 1 m 1 m crit m and if i 2 then m i m m i m m i 1 which clearly has ordertype mi 1 and since i 2 then 12 ensures that mi 1 i 1 theorem 5 9 in conjunction with woodin s result on the stationary tower gives the following corollary which is similar to corollary 3 2 of burke 2 corollary 5 12 suppose 2 is jonsson and there exists a woodin cardinal then in some forcing extension of v there is an elementary embedding j v n with n wellfounded crit j v v is a fixed point of j and the critical sequence of j is an element of v 20 sean d cox proof by theorem 5 9 there exists a tower i of height that decides its own critical sequence and is a canonical projection of ns since i is a canonical projec tion of ns by lemma 2 14 s i good is stationary where 2 let be a woodin cardinal and let g be generic for the full stationary tower p with s i good g let j v g n be the generic ultrapower by larson 11 n is wellfounded and j hv n in v g let n n be the critical sequence of j 16 now every m s i good has the property that m hm h has fixed point hm crit m hm and the critical sequence of m is an element of hm by los theorem n believes these same statements about m j hv since hm h v and m j h v it follows that h v 6 questions several results in this paper showed that in the presence of large cardinals ns can consistently fail to be universal for certain normal systems of filters for example if there is a strong cardinal that is not supercompact then many of its extenders are not canonical projections of ns corollary 4 3 and if there is an i 2 embedding then there exists an i 3 tower of ultrafilters that is not a canonical projection of ns conjunction of theorem 5 4 with lemma 5 5 on the other hand burke s zfc theorem shows that all normal ideals and normal towers of inaccessible height precipitous or otherwise are canonical projections of ns moreover the only normal systems of filters that provably exist in zfc that the author is aware of are those that are explicitly defined as projections of normal ideals 17 which are hence by burke s theorem canonical projections of ns this raises the following question question 6 1 is it consistent with zfc that every normal system of filters is a canonical projection of ns the referee suggested another related question motivated by the results in sec tion 4 question 6 2 is the existence of a strong non supercompact cardinal an anti large cardinal axiom i e is it the case that assuming as many large cardinal axioms as one wishes in the universe any strong cardinal must be supercompact added in press stamatis dimopoulos pointed out to the author that there exists a strong cardinal and every strong cardinal is supercompact is not consis tent because by the proof of proposition 26 11 of kanamori 10 if is supercom pact then there exists a and some superstrong embedding with crit and by composing with embeddings witnessing supercompactness of it follows that is a strong cardinal in particular if is the least supercompact cardinal then there is always a strong non supercompact cardinal below it 16 we do not know yet that this is the same as the critical sequence decided by i because g is generic for the stationary tower not for b i however they do end up being the same critical sequence 17 e g one can fix a stationary set s and canonically project ns s to another ideal a tower of ideals or an ideal extender on the universality of the nonstationary ideal 21 in fact the author does not even know if the statement there exists a strong cardinal and every strong cardinal is supercompact is even consistent by corollary 4 3 if is strong but not supercompact then for all sufficiently large all short strong extenders with critical point must fail to be canonical projections of ns in particular any model with at least one strong cardinal that witnesses a positive solution to question 6 1 would also witness the consistency of we turn now to questions about the material in section 5 it is straightforward to show that if f is a normal system of filters and the set of f self generic structures is f projective stationary then f is precipitous theorem 3 8 of 4 gave a converse to this in the case where f is a single ideal whose universe consists of countable sets 18 does this converse extend to cofinal towers theorem 5 2 shows that if i is a precipitous cofinal tower of normal ideals then there are i projective stationarily many i good structures 19 the following question asks if this can be improved to get self generic structures question 6 3 suppose i is a precipitous cofinal tower of ideals must the set of i self generic structures be i projective stationary recall from the discussion after definition 5 3 that i 3 embeddings were charac terized by i 3 towers of ultrafilters whereas i 2 embeddings were characterized by i 3 towers of ultrafilters that happen to be canonical projections of ns also theorem 5 9 showed under assumption of small continuum that is jonsson is equiv alent to the existence of an i 3 tower of height that decides its critical sequence and is a canonical projection of ns this analogy suggests the following conjecture conjecture 6 4 the phrase and is a canonical projection of ns cannot be removed from item 2 in the statement of theorem 5 9 i e the existence of an i 3 tower of height that decides its critical sequence does not imply that is jonsson references 1 giorgio audrito and
