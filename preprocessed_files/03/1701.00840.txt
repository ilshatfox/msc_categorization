abstract we continue the investigation of analytic spaces from the perspec tive of computable structure theory we show that if p 1 is a computable real and if is a nonzero non atomic and separable measure space then ev ery computable presentation of lp is computably linearly isometric to the standard computable presentation of lp 0 1 in particular lp 0 1 is com putably categorical we also show that there is a measure space that does not have a computable presentation even though lp does for every com putable real p 1 1 introduction in 1961 a n mal cev motivated by the work of fro lich shepherdson and others on effective field theory set forth the idea of an effective numbering of an algebra 19 these are now called computable presentations specifically a computable pre sentation of a structure such as a group ring graph etc is an assignment of nonnegative integers to the elements of the domain so that the induced relations including the relation induced by equality and functions on the nonnegative inte gers are computable a computable presentation of a structure can be thought of as a way of imposing a notion of computability on the structure in that it induces a set of computable functions and relations on the structure a structure is computably presentable if it has a computable presentation so we can think of the computably presentable structures as those upon which we can compute computable structure theory is the study of computable presentations of mathematical structures fro lich and shepherdson were the first to notice that different computable pre sentations of a structure may yield different classes of computable sets and opera tions specifically they demonstrated that there is a field for which there exist two computable presentations so that a splitting algorithm exists with respect to the first computable presentation but not with respect to the second 7 accordingly mal cev defined a computably presentable structure to be autostable if any two of its computable presentations are computably isomorphic 20 autostable structures are more commonly referred to as computably categorical thus a computably cat egorical structure can be thought of as one for which there is an absolute notion of computability for all other structures computability is referent to a computable presentation the computable categoricity of structures in various algebraic and combinato rial classes e g countable linear orders groups graphs etc has been intensively studied however until recently analytic structures such as metric spaces and ba nach spaces have been ignored in this context thus a research program has lately emerged to apply computable structure theory to analytic spaces one obvious 1 http arxiv org abs 1701 00840 v 5 2 joe clanin timothy h mcnicholl and don m stull obstacle is that these spaces are generally uncountable however our understand ing of computability on analytic spaces has advanced considerably in the last few decades and should no longer be seen as an impediment here we focus on the computable categoricity of lp spaces due to their centrality in many branches of analysis and computational mathematics indeed it could be argued that these spaces are more relevant for most mathematicians than the typical countable structures commonly studied in computable structure theory it is generally agreed that computability can only be studied on separable spaces at least with our current understanding of computation if an lp space is separable then its underlying measure space is separable thus we restrict our attention to lp spaces of separable measure spaces the computably categorical p spaces have been classified 22 23 so here we will focus on non atomic spaces our main theorem is the following theorem 1 1 if is a nonzero non atomic and separable measure space and if p 1 is a computable real then every computable presentation of lp is computably isometrically isomorphic to the standard computable presentation of lp 0 1 note that when we say that a measure space x m is nonzero we mean that there is a set a m so that 0 a so that lp is nonzero there are several corollaries corollary 1 2 if is a non atomic and separable measure space and if p 1 is a computable real then lp is computably categorical in particular for every computable real p 1 lp 0 1 is computably categorical thus when p 1 is computable lp 0 1 possesses an absolute notion of com putability and we need not concern ourselves about which computable presentation we choose when studying its computability theory corollary 1 3 let p be a computable real so that p 1 and suppose 1 2 are measure spaces that are nonzero non atomic and separable then each computable presentation of lp 1 is computably isometrically isomorphic to each computable presentation of lp 2 corollary 1 4 if is a computable presentation of a nonzero and non atomic measure space and if p 1 is a computable real then the induced computable presentation of lp is computably isometrically isomorphic to lp 0 1 previously the second author showed that pn is computably categorical when p 1 is a computable real this provided the first non trivial example of a computably categorical banach space that is not a hilbert space corollary 1 2 provides the first example of a computably presentable and infinite dimensional banach space that is computably categorical but not a hilbert space our main theorem can be seen as an effective version of a result of carathe odory if is a measure space that is nonzero non atomic and separable then lp is isometrically isomorphic to lp 0 1 3 however our proof is not a mere effectiviza tion of a classical proof for the classical proofs of carathe odory s result all begin with a sequence of transformations on the underlying measure space specifically it is first shown that there is a finite measure space 1 so that l p is isometri cally isomorphic to lp 1 it is then shown that there is a probability space 2 so analytic computable structure theory and lp spaces 3 that lp 2 is isometrically isomorphic to l p 1 is then shown to be isometrically isomorphic to lp 0 1 this approach is the natural course to take in the classical setting wherein one has full access to the lp space and to the underlying measure space but in the world of effective mathematics a computable presentation of lp does not yield a computable presentation of the underlying measure space i e it allows us to see the vectors but not necessarily the measurable sets this point will be made precise by way of an example in section 8 in particular the orem 1 1 is a stronger result than corollary 1 4 thus our proof of theorem 1 1 yields a new proof of carathe odory s result that does not make any transformations on the underlying measure space our main tool for doing this is the concept of a disintegration of an lp space which was previously used for p spaces by the second author but which we introduce here for arbitrary lp spaces the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents background and prelim inaries from analysis and computability theory in particular it gives a very brief survey of computable structure theory in the countable setting and a summary of prior results on analytic computable structure theory more expansive surveys of classical computable structure theory can be found in 6 and 15 section 3 gives an overview of the proof of theorem 1 1 in section 4 we develop precur sory new material from classical analysis in particular on disintegrations section 5 contains our new results on computable analysis and forms the bridge from the classical material in section 4 to theorem 1 1 section 6 contrasts our methods with those used for p spaces section 7 explores relative computable categoricity of lp spaces results on computable measure spaces and related lp spaces are expounded in section 8 section 9 gives concluding remarks 1 2 background and preliminaries we first cover preparatory material from classical mathematics after which we summarize preliminaries from computable effective mathematics in each case we summarize relevant standard information and content specific to this paper we then briefly survey the background of classical i e countable computable structure theory and prior results in analytic computable structure theory 2 1 classical world we begin with a few preliminaries from discrete mathe matics we then cover preliminaries from measure theory and banach spaces in particular lp spaces 2 1 1 discrete preliminaries when a is a finite set we denote its cardinality by a when p p is a partial order and a b p we write a b if a b are incom parable i e if a 6 b and b 6 a a lower semilattice is simple if 0 is the meet of any two incomparable elements of a lower semilattice is a proper extension of a lower semilattice if and for every u there is no nonzero v so that u v suppose p 0 p 0 0 and p 1 p 1 1 are partial orders a map f p 0 p 1 is monotone if f a 1 f b whenever a 0 b and is antitone if f b 1 f a whenever a 0 b 4 1 after submission the authors became aware of the work of f steinberg on representations of lp spaces in 31 our main theorem can be seen as an extension of theorem 3 8 of his paper 4 joe clanin timothy h mcnicholl and don m stull n denotes the set of all nonnegative integers n denotes the set of all finite sequences of nonnegative integers we regard a sequence as a map whose domain is an initial segment of n these sequences are referred to as nodes and the empty sequence is referred to as the root node when n denotes the length of i e the cardinality of the domain of when n we write if prefixes in this case we also say that is an ancestor of and that is a descendant of thus n is a partial order when n write for the concatenation of with we say that is a child of if n for some n n in which case we also say that is the parent of if is a node then denotes the set of all children of and if is a non root node then denotes the parent of we denote the lexicographic order of n by lex if s is a set of nodes then s is terminal if s by a tree we mean a set s of nodes so that each ancestor of a node of s also belongs to s i e s is closed under prefixes a set s of nodes is an orchard if it contains all of the non root ancestors of each of its nodes and does not contain the root node equivalently if 6 s and s is a tree note that if is a finite simple lower semilattice then 0 is isomorphic to an orchard 2 1 2 measure theoretic preliminaries we begin by summarizing relevant facts about separable measure spaces and atoms suppose x m is a measure space a collection d m of sets whose measures are all finite is dense in if for every a m with finite measure and every 0 there exists d d so that d a a measure space is separable if it has a countable dense set of measurable sets a measurable set a of a measure space is an atom of if a 0 and if there is no measurable subset b of a so that 0 b a if has no atoms it is said to be non atomic the following is due to sierpinski 29 theorem 2 1 suppose is a non atomic measure space then whenever a is a measurable set and 0 r a there is a measurable subset b of a so that b r we will also use the following observation proposition 2 2 every finite measure that is absolutely continuous with respect to a non atomic measure is itself non atomic proof suppose x m is a non atomic measure space and let be a finite measure that is absolutely continuous with respect to we first claim that whenever a is a measurable set so that a 0 there is a measurable subset b of a so that b and b 0 for let f d d since is finite f is integrable since a 0 there is a simple function s so that 0 s f and a s d 0 let ba s 1 a a for each real number a since 0 a s d it follows that 0 ba for some positive real a then ba ba f d ba s d a ba 0 analytic computable structure theory and lp spaces 5 now let a be a measurable set so that a 0 we show that a is not an atom of choose a measurable subset b of a so that b 0 and b it suffices to show that b is not an atom by way of contradiction suppose it is we define a descending sequence of measurable subsets of b as follows set b 0 b suppose bn has been defined bn 0 bn b and bn 2 n b since is non atomic by theorem 2 1 there is a measurable subset c of bn so that c 1 2 bn let d bn c since bn b bn is an atom of thus either c or d is equal to bn without loss of generality assume c bn set bn 1 c let b nbn thus b 0 on the other hand b limn bn b 6 0 and so we have a contradiction since is absolutely continuous with respect to thus b is not an atom of we identify measurable sets whose symmetric difference is null when we refer to a collection of measurable sets as a lower semilattice we mean it is a lower semilattice under the partial ordering of inclusion modulo sets of measure 0 2 1 3 banach space preliminaries we first cover material relevant to banach spaces in general and then that which is specific to lp spaces we take the complex num bers to be the field of scalars however all of our results hold in the real case as well suppose b is a banach space when x b we write l x for the linear span of x and x for the closed linear span of x i e x l x when k is a subfield of c write lk x for the linear span of x over k i e lk x m j 0 jvj m n 0 m k v 0 vm x note that the linear span of x is dense in b if and only if the linear span of x over q i is dense in b when s is a finite set we let bs denote the set of all maps from s into b when f bs we write f s for max f t t s it follows that s is a norm on bs under which bs is a banach space computability on banach spaces will be defined in terms of structures and pre sentations although these notions may be germane only to computability theory they are nevertheless purely classical objects so we cover them and related concepts here a structure on b is a mapd n b so that b ran d ifd is a structure on b then we call the pair b d a presentation of b clearly a banach space has a presentation if and only if it is separable among all presentations of a banach space b one may be designated as standard in this case we will identify b with its standard presentation in particular if p 1 is a computable real and if d is a standard map of n onto the set of characteristic functions of dyadic subintervals of 0 1 then lp 0 1 d is the standard presentation of lp 0 1 if r n 1 for all n n then c r is the standard presentation of c as a banach space over itself each presentation of a banach space induces corresponding classes of rational vectors and rational open balls as follows suppose b b d is a presentation of b each vector in the linear span of ran d over q i will be called a rational vector of b an open rational ball of b is an open ball whose center is a rational vector of b and whose radius is a positive rational number a presentation of b induces a corresponding presentation of bs as follows sup pose b b d is a presentation of b let s be a finite set and let ds denote 6 joe clanin timothy h mcnicholl and don m stull a standard map of n onto the set of all maps from s into ran d it follows that bs bs ds is a presentation of bs we now cover preliminaries on lp spaces fix a measure space x m and a real p 1 when f lp we write supp f for the support of f i e the set of all t x so that f t 6 0 note that since we identify measurable sets whose symmetric difference is null supp f is well defined we say that vectors f g lp are disjointly supported if the intersection of their supports is null i e if f t g t 0 for almost every t x if f g lp then we write f g if f t g t for almost all t x for which f t 6 0 in this case we say that f is a subvector of g note that f is a subvector of g if and only if g f and f are disjointly supported note also that f g if and only if f g a for some measurable set a when we refer to a collection d lp as a lower semilattice we mean it is a lower semilattice with respect to the subvector ordering suppose s is a set of nodes and s lp we say that is separating if it maps incomparable nodes to disjointly supported vectors we now formulate a numerical test for disjointness of support suppose p 1 and p 6 2 when z w c let z w 4 2 2 p 1 2 z p w p z w p z w p we will use the following result from 23 which extends a theorem of j lamperti 17 theorem 2 3 suppose p 1 and p 6 2 1 for all z w c min z p w p z w 2 furthermore if 1 p 2 then 2 z p 2 w p z w p z w p 0 and if 2 p then 2 z p 2 w p z w p z w p 0 again suppose p 1 and p 6 2 let x m be a measure space when f g lp let f g 4 2 2 p 1 2 f pp g p p f g p p f g p p it follows from theorem 2 3 2 that f g x f t g t d t it then follows that f g are disjointly supported if and only if f g 0 when s is a finite set and s lp set where range over s theorem 2 3 now yields the following numerical test to see if a map is separating and antitone corollary 2 4 suppose 1 p and p 6 2 suppose s is a finite set of nodes and s lp then is a separating antitone map if and only if 0 analytic computable structure theory and lp spaces 7 now suppose s is a tree call a map s lp summative if s whenever is a nonterminal node of s a disintegration is a summative separating and antitone map s lp 0 with the additional property that the linear span of its range is dense in lp we define a partial disintegration of lp to be a separating and injective antitone map of a finite orchard into lp 0 now suppose 1 and 2 are measure spaces suppose 1 2 are antitone maps of lp 1 and l p 2 respectively an isomorphism of 1 with 2 is an injective monotone map f of dom 1 onto dom 2 so that 2 f p 1 p for all dom 1 a map s lp 0 1 is interval valued if is the characteristic function of an interval for each dom 2 2 computable world we assume the reader is familiar with the rudiments of computability theory such as computable functions sets c e sets and oracle computation an excellent reference is 5 2 2 1 computable categoricity in the countable realm to give our work some con text we synopsize some background material on computable structure theory in the countable realm this will motivate our definitions for banach spaces below as well as some already given in particular we give precise definitions of computable categoricity and relative computable categoricity and survey related results more expansive expositions can be found in 6 and 1 to begin suppose a is a structure with domain a a numbering of a is a surjection of n onto a if is a numbering of a then the pair a is called a presentation of a suppose a a is a presentation of a we say that a is a computable presentation of a if m n m n is computable for each n ary relation r of a x 1 xn r x 1 xn is computable and for each n ary function f an a ofa x 1 xn y f x 1 xn y is computable note we regard constants as 0 ary functions we say that a countable structure a is computably presentable if it has a computable presentation it is well known that there are countable structures without computable presentations see 6 for a survey of such results suppose a 1 and a 2 are structures and suppose a j aj j is a presentation of aj for each j we say that a map f a 1 a 2 is a computable map of a 1 into a 2 if there is a computable map f n n so that f 1 n 2 f n for all n n we similarly define what it means for an oracle to compute a map of a 1 into a 2 we say that a computably presentable countable structure a is computably cat egorial if any two computable presentations of a are computably isomorphic this is equivalent to saying that a 1 is computably isomorphic to a 2 whenever a 1 and a 2 are computable presentations of structures that are isomorphic to a 8 joe clanin timothy h mcnicholl and don m stull it is easy to see that q is computably categorical use cantor s back and forth construction on the other hand a fairly straightforward diagonalization shows that n is not computably categorical as mentioned in the introduction the interaction of computable categoricity and structure has been studied extensively for example j remmel showed that a computably presentable boolean algebra is computably categorical if and only it is has finitely many atoms 28 goncharov lempp and solomon proved that a computably presentable ordered abelian group is computably categorical if and only if it has finite rank 11 recently o levin proved that every computably presentable ordered field with finite transcendence degree is computably categori cal 18 the effect of structure on other computability notions has been studied intensively see e g 16 for a very good overview we now define relative computable categoricity we first define the diagram of a presentation suppose a is a structure and a a is a presentation of a the diagram of a is the join of the following sets m n m n x 1 xn r x 1 xn for each n ary relation r of a x 1 xn y f x 1 xn y for each function f an a of a we say that a computably presentable countable structure a is relatively com putably categorical if whenever a and a are computable presentations of a the join of their diagrams computes an isomorphism of a onto a s goncharov gave a syntactic characterization of the relatively computable cat egorical countable structures 12 clearly every relatively computably categorical structure is computably categorical s goncharov also constructed a computably categorical structure that is not relatively computably categorical 8 numerous extensions of these results have been proven see e g the survey 6 the effect of structure on the separation of relative computable categoricity from computable categoricity has also been examined for example a relatively computably categorical countable structure is computably categorical if it is either a linear order a boolean algebra or an abelian p group 10 28 9 30 2 we now turn to the foundations of computable structure theory on analytic spaces 2 2 2 computability on banach spaces our approach to computable structure the ory on banach spaces parallels the development of computable structure theory on metric spaces in 13 see also 27 we first define what is meant by a computable presentation of a banach space we then define for a computable presentation of a banach space the associated computable vectors sequences c e open sets and c e closed sets we then define the computable maps for computable presentations of banach spaces after we summarize fundamental relationships between these notions we define computable categoricity for banach sapces suppose b is a banach space and b b d is a presentation of b we say that b is a computable presentation of b if the norm is computable on the rational vectors of b more formally if there is an algorithm that given any nonnegative integer k and any finite sequence of scalars 0 m q i computes a rational number q so that j jd j q 2 k the standard presentation c is a computable presentation as is the standard presentation of lp 0 1 when p 1 is analytic computable structure theory and lp spaces 9 a computable real we say that b is computably presentable if it has a computable presentation we note that if b is a computable presentation of a banach space b and if s is a finite set then bs as defined in section 4 is a computable presentation of bs we now define the computable vectors and sequences of a computable presen tation of a banach space fix a banach space b and a computable presentation b of b a vector v b is a computable vector of b if there is an algorithm that given any nonnegative integer k computes a rational vector u of b so that v u 2 k in other words it is possible to compute arbitrarily good approxi mations of v if v is a computable vector of b then a code of such an algorithm will be referred to as an index of v a sequence vn n n of vectors in b is a com putable sequence of b if there is an algorithm that given any nonnegative integers k n as input computes a rational vector u of b so that u vn 2 k in other words vn is computable uniformly in n if vn n n is a computable sequence of vectors of b then a code of such an algorithm shall be referred to as an index of vn n n suppose lp is a computable presentation of lp and let s be a set of nodes a map s lp is a computable map of s into lp if there is an algorithm that computes an index of from if s and does not halt on any node that is not in s we now define the c e open and closed subsets of a computable presentation b of a banach space b an open subset u of b is a c e open subset of b if the set of all open rational balls of b that are included in u is c e if u is a c e open subset of b then an index of u is a code of a turing machine that enumerates all open rational balls that are included in u a closed subset c of b is a c e closed subset of b if the set of all open rational balls of b that contain a point of c is c e if c is a c e closed subset of b then an index of c is a code of a turing machine that enumerates all open rational balls that contain a point of c now we define computable maps suppose b 1 is a computable presentation of b 1 and b 2 is a computable presentation of b 2 a map t b 1 b 2 is a computable map of b 1 into b 2 if there is a computable function p that maps rational balls of b 1 to rational balls of b 2 so that t b 1 p b 1 whenever p b 1 is defined and so that whenever u is a neighborhood of t v there is a rational ball b 1 of b 1 so that v b 1 and p b 1 u in other words it is possible to compute arbitrarily good approximations of t v from sufficiently good approximations of v an index of such a function p will be referred to as an index of t suppose b 1 b 1 r 1 it is well known that if t is a bounded linear operator of b 1 into b 2 then t is computable if and only if t r 1 n n is a computable sequence of b 2 this principle holds uniformly if one is also provided with a bound on the operator t that is from an upper bound on t and an index of t r 1 n n one can compute an index of t note that if lp is a computable presentation of lp then is a com putable real valued map from lp s into c the following are folklore and follow easily from the definitions proposition 2 5 suppose b 1 b 2 are banach spaces let b j be a computable presentation of bj for each j and let t be a computable map of b 1 into b 2 10 joe clanin timothy h mcnicholl and don m stull then t 1 u is a c e open subset of b 2 whenever u is a c e open subset of b 2 furthermore an index of t 1 u can be computed from indices of t and u proposition 2 6 suppose b is a banach space and let b be a computable pre sentation of b if f is a computable real valued function from b into c with the property that f v d v f 1 0 for all v b then f 1 0 is c e closed furthermore an index of f 1 0 can be computed from an index of f proposition 2 7 suppose b is a banach space and b is a computable presenta tion of b let u be a c e open subset of b and let c be a c e closed subset of b so that c u 6 then c u contains a computable vector of b furthermore an index of such a vector can be computed from indices of u c proposition 2 8 suppose b is a banach space and b is a computable presenta tion of b let vn n n be a computable sequence of b so that vn vn 1 2 n for all n n then limn vn is a computable vector of b furthermore an index of limn vn can be computed from an index of vn n n we now define a banach space b to be computably categorical if any two of its computable presentations are computably isometrically isomorphic equivalently if b 1 is computably isomorphically isometric to b 2 whenever b 1 b 2 are computable presentations of banach spaces that are isomorphically isometric to b 2 2 3 summary of prior work in analytic computable structure theory the earliest work in analytic computable structure theory is implicit in the 1989 monograph of pour el and richards 27 namely it is shown that 1 is not computably categorical but that all separable hilbert spaces are but there was no more progress until 2013 when a number of results on metric spaces appeared in particular melnikov and nies showed that computably presentable compact metric spaces are 03 categorical and that there is a computably presentable polish space that is not 02 categorical 26 at the same time melnikov showed that the cantor space urysohn space and all separable hilbert spaces are computably categorical as metric spaces but that as a metric space c 0 1 is not 24 recently greenberg knight melnikov and turetsky announced an analog of goncharov s syntactic characterization of relative computable categoricity for metric spaces 13 new results on banach spaces began to appear in 2014 first melnikov and ng showed that c 0 1 is not computably categorical 25 then mcnicholl extended the work of pour el and richards by showing that p is computably categorical only when p 2 and that p is 02 categorical when p is a computable real mcnicholl also showed that pn is computably categorical when p is a computable real and n is a positive integer more recently mcnicholl and stull have shown that whenever p is a computable presentation of p there is a least powerful turing degree that computes an isometric isomorphism of p onto p and that these degrees are precisely the c e degrees 21 3 overview of the proof of theorem 1 1 as noted every separable l 2 space is computably categorical since it is a hilbert space so we can confine ourselves to the case p 6 2 the three key steps to our proof of theorem 1 1 are encapsulated in the following three theorems analytic computable structure theory and lp spaces 11 theorem 3 1 let lp 1 be a computable presentation of lp 1 and let lp 2 be a computable presentation of lp 2 suppose there is a computable disintegration of lp 1 that is computably isomorphic to a computable disinte gration of lp 2 then there is a computable linear isometry of lp 1 onto lp 2 theorem 3 2 let p be a computable real so that p 1 and let be a non atomic separable measure space suppose lp is a computable presentation of lp and suppose is a computable disintegration of lp so that p 1 then there is a computable disintegration of lp 0 1 that is computably isomorphic to theorem 3 3 let p 1 be a computable real so that p 6 2 suppose is a separable nonzero measure space and suppose lp is a computable presentation of lp then there is a computable disintegration of lp theorem 1 1 follows immediately from theorems 3 1 through theorem 3 3 our proofs of each of these theorems are supported by a certain amount of classical ma terial that is material that is devoid of computability content which is developed in section 4 the transition from the classical realm to the computable is effected in section 5 4 classical world we divide our work into three parts isomorphism of disintegrations extension of partial disintegrations and approximation of separating antitone maps subsection 4 1 contains our results on isomorphism of disintegrations this material provides the classical component of the proofs of theorems 3 1 and 3 2 subsection 4 2 contains our results on extensions of partial disintegrations and our theorem on approximation of separating antitone maps appears in subsection 4 3 the results in these two subsections support our proof of theorem 3 3 4 1 isomorphism results our proof of theorem 3 1 is based on the idea that an isomorphism can be lifted to form a linear isometry we make this precise as follows definition 4 1 suppose 1 2 are disintegrations of l p 1 and l p 2 respec tively and suppose f is an isomorphism of 1 with 2 we say that t l p 1 lp 2 lifts f if t 1 2 f for all dom 1 we show here that liftings of isomorphisms exist and are unique namely we prove the following theorem 4 2 suppose 1 2 are measure spaces and that j is a disintegration of lp j for each j suppose f is an isomorphism of 1 with 2 then there is a unique linear isometry of lp 1 onto l p 2 that lifts f in section 5 we complete the proof of theorem 3 1 by showing that if f 1 2 are computable then the lifting of f is computable the proof of theorem 3 2 is based on the following proposition 4 3 let be a nonzero non atomic measure space and let be a disintegration of lp so that p 1 suppose is an interval valued separating antitone map that is isomorphic to and suppose dom is a tree then is a disintegration of lp 0 1 12 joe clanin timothy h mcnicholl and don m stull in section 5 we complete the proof of theorem 3 2 by showing that when is computable there is a computable interval valued separating antitone map that is computably isomorphic to we now proceed with the proofs of theorem 4 2 and proposition 4 3 proof of theorem 4 2 suppose j xj mj j we first define a linear map t on the linear span of ran 1 in particular we let t f 1 f 2 f for every finite f dom 1 and every corresponding family of scalars f we first show that t is well defined suppose g f 1 1 f 2 1 without loss of generality we assume f 1 f 2 f where f is a finite tree we first make some observations suppose f lp is a separating antitone map let f s supp note that s supp f supp and that supp s also note that and are disjointly supported when 6 we claim that if c for each f then f f for when s supp s s and s 0 if 6 so f f f s f s f analytic computable structure theory and lp spaces 13 thus g f 1 f 1 since nonzero disjointly supported vectors are linearly independent it follows that whenever 1 6 0 let 2 f since f is an isomorphism is a disintegration and p 1 p for all f thus f f f f thus t is well defined we now also note that f pp f p 1 p p f p pp t f pp it now follows that t extends to a unique isometric linear map of lp 1 into lp 2 denote this map by t as well since ran 2 ran t it follows that t is surjective now suppose s is an isometric linear map of lp 1 onto l p 2 so that s 1 2 f for all dom 1 so s 1 t 1 for all dom 1 that is s f t f whenever f ran 1 since the linear span of ran 1 is dense in l p 1 it follows that s t to prove proposition 4 3 we will need the following lemma lemma 4 4 suppose fn n is a sequence of vectors in lp so that fn 1 fn for all n then fn n converges in the lp norm proof since fn 1 fn it follows that fn 1 p fn p and moreover that fn fm p fm p fn p whenever n m so on the one hand limn fn p exists on the other hand this implies that fn n is a cauchy sequence thus fn n converges in the lp norm 14 joe clanin timothy h mcnicholl and don m stull proof of proposition 4 3 first we claim that if 0 then there exists n so that max p n for suppose otherwise let s dom p thus since is an antitone map s is a tree since is interval valued s is a finitely branching tree let be an infinite branch of s that is is a function from n into s so that n 1 n for all n n let f be an isomorphism of onto then by lemma 4 4 limn f n exists in the l p norm let h denote this limit then h p and ran h g lp 0 1 supp g supp h since is non atomic by theorem 2 1 and proposition 2 2 there is a measurable set a so that h a p 2 therefore h a 6 ran a contradiction now to show that is a disintegration it suffices to show that ran lp 0 1 to this end it suffices to show that i ran whenever i is a subin terval of 0 1 now suppose a b 0 1 since is interval valued for each there is an interval i 0 1 so that i choose 0 and n so that p whenever dom and n since is a disintegration and since p 1 it follows that n i 0 1 let f dom n i a b 6 so a b f i thus f i a b 2 and therefore a b ran hence ran lp 0 1 4 2 extending partial disintegrations our goal in this subsection is to prove the following which will support our proof of theorem 3 3 theorem 4 5 suppose is a separable measure space and 1 p suppose is a partial disintegration of lp then for every finite subset f of lp and every nonnegative integer k extends to a partial disintegration so that d f ran 2 k for every f f we divide the majority of the proof of theorem 4 5 into a sequence of lemmas as follows lemma 4 6 let be a measure space and suppose 1 p let f lp be supported on a set of finite measure then for every 0 there is a simple function s so that supp s supp f and s f supp f p proof suppose x m let a supp f without loss of generality suppose f p 0 let 0 for each nonnegative integer k let ak t x f t 2 k since a limk a ak 0 choose k so that a ak 2 set g 1 f ak thus g l so there is a simple function s so that supp s ak and s g 1 2 f p then s f ak p p s f f p p s g p f p 1 s g p f p 1 s g p f p p 2 p p analytic computable structure theory and lp spaces 15 so s f a p s f ak p ak a p lemma 4 7 suppose is a measure space and 1 p suppose d lp is a simple lower semilattice with the property that the upper semilattice generated by the supports of the vectors in d is dense in then the linear span of d is dense in lp proof suppose x m it suffices to show that if a then a is a limit point of the linear span of d in the lp norm so suppose a choose f 0 fn d so that a n j 0 supp fj 3 since d is simple we can assume f 0 f 1 fn are disjointly supported thus a n j 0 supp fj p 3 set f n j 0 fj and set b j n supp fj thus b supp f by lemma 4 6 there is a simple function s so that sf b p 3 hence a sf p 2 3 let s k j 0 j aj where a 0 ak are pairwise disjoint measurable subsets of x and 0 k are nonzero thus aj and sf k j 0 jf aj set m max 0 k choose 0 so that e f pd 3 p 1 k 1 m whenever e is a measurable subset of x so that e for each j there exist gj 0 gj mj d so that aj s supp gj s set bj s supp gj s and let hj sbj s thus sf j jf aj p p j j x f p aj hj d j j aj hj f p d m k 1 3 p 1 m k 1 3 p thus a j jf hj p now note that ft bj s 0 if bj s supp ft 0 ft if ft gj s gj s if gj s ft it follows that j jf hj belongs to the linear span of d 16 joe clanin timothy h mcnicholl and don m stull lemma 4 8 suppose is a measure space and d is a finite simple lower semilat tice of measurable sets then for every measurable set a that does not belong to the upper semilattice generated by d d properly extends to a finite simple lower semi lattice d of measurable sets so that a belongs to the upper semilattice generated by d proof when y d define the remnant of y to be y z z d z y let r denote the set of all remnants of sets in d note that any two distinct sets in r are disjoint let r r a r r sa a d d d r sa we claim that d is a simple lower semilattice for suppose x 1 x 2 d are incomparable we can suppose one of x 1 x 2 does not belong to d we can also assume one of x 1 x 2 does not belong to r if x 1 or x 2 is sa then x 1 x 2 so we can assume x 1 d and x 2 r thus there exists a remnant r of a set y d so that x 2 r a thus r y so y 6 x 1 if x 1 y is null then so is x 1 x 2 so suppose x 1 x then r x 1 so x 2 x 1 we now note that r d thus a sa r and so a belongs to the upper semilattice generated by d thus d d we now show that d properly extends d suppose b d d and suppose c is a nonzero set in d if b sa then b c and so b 6 c suppose b r a where r is the remnant of y d by way of contradiction suppose b c then y c and so r c which is impossible since c is nonempty thus d properly extends d lemma 4 9 suppose is a partial disintegration of lp and suppose d lp is a finite simple lower semilattice of vectors in lp that properly extends ran then extends to a partial disintegration of lp with range d 0 proof let s dom by induction we can assume d ran 1 suppose f is the unique element of d ran since g 6 f for all g ran precisely two cases arise the first is f 6 g for all g ran for this case we let t max z n z s set s s t 1 and define s lp by f t 1 6 t 1 by choice of t and the incomparability of t 1 with each element of s is an injective antitone map that is separating follows from the incomparability of f with any element of ran furthermore s is a finite subtree of n so is a partial disintegration onto d that extends the other case is that there exists g ran so that f g since s is finite there is a minimal vector g ran so that f g since ran is simple and analytic computable structure theory and lp spaces 17 since f is nonzero g is unique note that f is incomparable with every element h of ran so that g 6 h we let t max z n 1 g z s s s 1 g t 1 for all s let f s s s by our choice of g and t is an injective antitone map that is separating follows from the incomparability of 1 g t 1 with every element of s so that 6 1 g the set s is also a finite orchard so is a partial disintegration onto d which extends proof of theorem 4 5 let r r 0 r 1 be a countable dense set of measur able sets we build a set d ran that satisfies the hypotheses of lemma 4 7 to ensure this we ensure that each set in r belongs to the upper semilattice gen erated by the supports of the vectors in d we construct d by defining a sequence d 0 d 1 and setting d ndn to begin set d 0 ran 0 let n n and suppose dn has been defined let f supp f f dn by way of induction supposedn is a simple lower semilattice thus f is a simple lower semilattice of measurable sets by lemma 4 8 there is a simple lower semilattice f so that rn belongs to the upper semilattice generated by f let h 1 dn let h 2 rn supp h 1 let dn 1 h 1 h 2 s s f thus since f is a simple lower semilattice dn 1 is a simple lower semilattice under we claim that dn dn 1 for let f dn thus s supp f f so h 1 h 2 s dn 1 but h 1 h 2 s h 1 s f so it follows from lemma 4 7 that the linear span of d is dense in lp so there exists a finite s d 0 so that d f s 2 k we can assume ran s we can now apply lemma 4 9 4 3 approximating separating antitone maps we show that the functional defined in section 2 can be used to estimate distance to the nearest separating antitone map theorem 4 10 suppose is a measure space and p is a real so that p 1 and p 6 2 suppose s lp is a partial disintegration of lp and s lp where s s is a finite orchard so that each s s is a descendant of a node in s then there is a separating antitone map s lp so that 4 1 ps s p s 2 p s s proof let s s let 0 let 0 min 0 v p 0 p min 0 0 p 0 p where range over s when define the nullifiable set of to be the set of all t x so that t p 0 t for some that belongs to denote the nullifiable set of by n when define the source node of to be the maximal so that s thus each has a source node 18 joe clanin timothy h mcnicholl and don m stull let s if s then define to be if then define to be 1 n where is the source node of note that n n if and thus is antitone suppose are incomparable suppose t 6 n then t p 0 t so t p 0 t thus t p min t p t p 0 t hence t n thus 1 n and 1 n are disjointly supported so suppose s are incomparable if either s or if then and are incomparable suppose s and let denote the source node of then 6 and 6 thus are incomparable and so and are disjointly supported thus and are disjointly supported now note that ps s p s p suppose and t x we claim that t t p 2 p 0 t for suppose t 6 n then t t where is the source node of also t p 0 t so t p min t t p t p thus t t p min t t p t p 0 t 2 p 0 t suppose t n then t 0 there exists so that t p 0 t without loss of generality suppose t p 0 t so t p min t t p t p therefore t t p 0 t so t p 2 p 0 t since a b p 2 p 1 a p b p 5 computable world we now have all the pieces in place to prove theorems 3 1 and 3 2 proof of theorem 3 1 suppose 1 is a computable disintegration of l p 1 and that 2 is a computable disintegration of l p 2 that is computably isomorphic to 1 the domain of j is c e so there is a computable surjection g j of n onto dom j let gj j g j thus gj is a structure on lp j so let lp j lp j j since j is a computable disintegration of l p j it follows that lp j is a computable presentation of lp j and that the identity map is a computable map of lp j onto lp j let f be a computable isomorphism of 1 with 2 thus by theorem 4 2 there is a unique linear isometric map of lp 1 onto l p 2 that lifts f denote this map by t since t lifts f it follows that t g 1 n n is a computable sequence of lp 2 since t is bounded it follows that t is a computable map of lp 1 onto lp 2 thus there is a computable linear isometry of lp 1 onto lp 2 since t is an isometry t 1 thus the conclusion holds uniformly proof of theorem 3 2 without loss of generality suppose p 1 let s dom every c e tree is computably isomorphic to a computable tree so without loss of generality we assume s is computable analytic computable structure theory and lp spaces 19 set i 0 1 suppose s and let 0 lex 1 lex be the children of in s for each n set i n j n j pp j n j pp since for all s it follows that i 0 1 for all set i it follows that is a separating antitone map it also follows that is computable and that the identity map gives a computable isomorphism of with thus by proposition 4 3 is a disintegration to prove theorem 3 3 we augment the classical material developed so far with the following three lemmas the third lemma requires the notion of a success index which we define now definition 5 1 suppose lp lp r is a presentation let s be a finite orchard and let s lp the success index of is the largest integer n so that d r j ran 2 n whenever 0 j n and s p 2 n whenever is a nonterminal node of s the success index of an antitone separating map can be viewed as a measure of how close it is to being a disintegration antitone separating maps with larger success indices are closer to being disintegrations lemma 5 2 suppose b is a banach space and let b be a computable presentation of b let s be a finite set of nodes 1 the set of all injective maps in bs is a c e open subset of b furthermore an index of this set can be computed from s 2 suppose v 0 vk are computable vectors of b and n n then the set of all bs so that d vj ran 2 n whenever 0 j k is a c e open subset of b furthermore an index of this set can be computed from n s and indices of v 0 vk 3 suppose n n and s is an orchard then the set of all bs so that s p 2 n for every nonterminal node of s is a c e open subset of b furthermore and index of this set can be computed from n and s proof we will repeatedly use the following well known fact if u v are c e open subsets of bs then u v is a c e open subset of bs and an index of u v can be computed from indices of u v 1 let s 1 denote the set of all injective maps in bs suppose s are distinct define g bs b by g 20 joe clanin timothy h mcnicholl and don m stull then g is a computable map of bs into b furthermore an index of g can be computed from s and the set of nonzero vectors in b is a c e open subset of b so by proposition 2 5 u g 1 b 0 is a c e open subset of bs furthermore an index of u can be computed from and s since s 1 u it follows that s 1 is a c e open subset of bs and that an index of s 1 can be computed from s 2 by considering intersections it suffices to consider the case where k 0 let s 2 denote the set of all bs so that d v 0 ran 2 n observe that s 2 if and only if there exists a map s q i so that 5 1 v 0 s p 2 n for each such a map define f bs b by f s f then f is a computable map of bs into b furthermore an index of f can be computed from s and thus by proposition 2 5 v f 1 b 0 2 n is a c e open subset of bs furthermore an index of v can be computed from n and s since s 2 v it follows that s 2 is a c e open subset of bs and that an index of s 2 can be computed from s and n 3 now suppose s is an orchard let s 3 denote the set of all bs so that for every nonterminal node of s s 2 n where ranges over all children of in s fix a nonterminal node of s define a map f bs b by f s then f is a computable map of bs into b furthermore an index of f can be computed from and s thus w f 1 b 0 2 n is a c e open subset of bs and an index ofw can be computed from s n and since s 3 w s 3 is a c e open subset of bs and an index of s 3 can be computed from s and n lemma 5 3 suppose p 1 is a computable real so that p 6 2 and suppose lp is a computable presentation of lp let s be a finite orchard then the set of all separating antitone maps in lp s is a c e closed subset of lp s furthermore an index of this set can be computed from s proof let h denote the set of all separating antitone maps in lp s for each lp s let f 2 p thus f is a computable nonnegative function from lp s into c furthermore an index of f can be computed from s by theorem 4 10 f d h it follows from corollary 2 4 that h f 1 0 analytic computable structure theory and lp spaces 21 so by proposition 2 6 h is a c e closed subset of lp s and an index of h can be computed from s lemma 5 4 suppose p 1 is a computable real so that p 6 2 let be a separable measure space and let lp be a computable presentation of lp assume s lp is a computable partial disintegration of lp whose success index is at least n 1 then for every k n n there is a computable partial disintegration of lp so that dom s s s 2 k the success index of is at least n and the success index of s is at least n 1 furthermore dom and an index of can be computed from k n and an index of proof for the moment fix a finite orchard s let us denote the set of all injective maps in lp s let vs n denote the set of all maps in s whose success index is at least n let hs denote the set of all separating antitone maps in lp s by lemma 5 2 us and vs n are c e open subsets of l p s and indices of these sets can be computed from s n by lemma 5 3 hs is a c e closed subset of lp s and an index of hs can be computed from s when s s let s denote the canonical projection of lp s onto lp s and let cs us vs n 1 s b 2 k vs n 1 hs by theorem 4 5 there is an s so that cs 6 such an s can be found by an effective search procedure by proposition 2 7 cs contains a computable vector of lp s and an index of can be computed from k n and an index of we are now ready to prove theorem 3 3 proof of theorem 3 3 suppose lp lp r set s 0 0 since is nonzero r j 0 6 0 for some j 0 such a number j 0 can be computed by a search procedure set 0 0 r j 0 by lemma 5 2 we can compute k 0 n so that every map in b 0 2 k 0 is injective and never 0 it now follows from lemma 5 4 that there is a sequence n n of computable partial disintegrations of lp and a computable sequence kn n of nonnegative integers that have following properties 1 an index of n and a canonical index of dom n can be computed form n 2 if sn dom n then sn sn 1 and n 1 sn n sn 2 kn 1 3 each map in b n 2 kn is injective never zero and has a success index that is at least n so let n t t n sn for all n t it follows that n t t is a computable sequence of lp sn furthermore an index of this sequence can be computed from n it also follows that n t 1 n t sn 2 kn t 1 thus by proposition 2 8 n limt n t is a computable vector of l p sn furthermore an index of n can be computed from n also n n sn 2 kn thus n is a partial disintegration whose success index is at least n since sn sn 1 n t 1 n 1 t thus n n 1 let n n 22 joe clanin timothy h mcnicholl and don m stull the only thing that prevents from being a disintegration is that 6 dom we fix this as follows let s dom for each s let 2 0 0 1 p then let n 1 s since s is computable it follows that is a computable vector of lp it then follows that is a computable disintegration of lp 6 a comparison of arguments for p and lp spaces here we discuss why arguments previously used to show that certain p spaces are not computably categorical can not be applied to lp 0 1 we then discuss why our techniques for lp spaces of non atomic measure spaces can not be applied to p spaces we begin by examining why arguments for p spaces can not be generalized to lp 0 1 as mentioned in subsection 2 2 3 pour el and richards proved that 1 is not computably categorical their proof rests on an observation about the extreme points of the unit ball in 1 however the unit ball in l 1 0 1 does not have extreme points later mcnicholl showed that p is computably categorical only when p 2 his proof utilizes the banach lamperti characterization of the isometries of p which extends to lp spaces of finite spaces however it also uses the fact that p has a disjointly supported schauder basis which lp 0 1 does not we now discuss why our arguments for lp spaces can not be applied to p spaces in particular we look at the three key steps stated in section 3 theorems 3 1 and 3 3 do not assume the underlying measure spaces are non atomic but theorem 3 2 does and the construction in 21 shows that when p 6 2 there is a computable presentation b of p and a computable disintegration of b that is not computably isomorphic to any computable disintegration of the standard presentation of p 7 relative computable categoricity we begin by defining what we mean by the diagram of a presentation of a banach space our approach parallels that in 13 suppose b is a banach space and b b r is a presentation of b we define the diagram of b to be the set of all triples v r 0 r 1 so that v is a rational vector of b r 0 r 1 q and r 0 v r 1 we denote the diagram of b by d b we say that a separable banach space b is relatively computably categorical if there is a turing machine m so that whenever b and b are presentations of b and d n n n d n n n are enumerations of d b d b respectively their join computes an isometric isomorphism of b onto b our proofs are sufficiently uniform to show the following theorem 7 1 if lp is computably presentable and if is non atomic and separable then lp is relatively computably categorical analytic computable structure theory and lp spaces 23 8 computable measure spaces we first define what we mean by a computable presentation of a measure space our approach parallels that in 32 to begin suppose r is a ring of sets a structure on r is a map of n onto r if r is a structure on r the pair r r is called a presentation of r now suppose x m is a measure space a structure on is a structure on a ring that generates m and whose members have finite measure if r is a structure on then the pair r is called a presentation of suppose r r r is a presentation of a ring of sets we say that r is a computable presentation of r if there are computable functions f g from n 2 into n so that for all m n n r n r m r f n m and r n r m r g m n let be a measure space suppose r is a structure on and let r ran r we say r is a computable presentation of if r r is a computable presenta tion ofr and if r n can be computed from n that is if there is an algorithm that given n k n as input computes a rational number q so that q r n 2 k a measure space x m is said to be countably generated if the algebra m is generated by a countable collection of measurable sets each of which has finite measure such a collection is said to generate we have two key results theorem 8 1 if r is a computable structure on a measure space and if dr n r n for all n n then lp dr is a computable presentation of lp for every computable real p 1 theorem 8 2 there is a countably generated measure space that does not have a computable presentation but so that lp has a computable presentation whenever 1 p is computable to prove theorem 8 1 we need some preliminary material on measure spaces it is well known that every countably generated measure space is separable but not conversely in particular the following is essentially theorem a p 168 of halmos 14 theorem 8 3 suppose is a measure space and that g is a countable set that generates then the ring generated by g is dense in s corollary 8 4 suppose x m is a measure space that is generated by a countable set g and let r denote the ring generated by g then the linear span of r r r is dense in lp proof let r r r r it follows from theorem 8 3 that a lies in the subspace generated by r whenever a is a measurable set whose measure is finite thus s belongs to the subspace generated by r whenever s is a simple function whose support has finite measure since these functions are dense in lp so is the linear span of r suppose r is a presentation of set dr n r n for all n n it follows from theorem 8 3 that lp dr is a presentation of l p which we refer to as the induced presentation we are now ready to prove theorem 8 1 24 joe clanin timothy h mcnicholl and don m stull proof of theorem 8 1 it follows from corollary 8 4 that the linear span of r n n n is dense in lp suppose 0 m q i for each h 0 1 m 1 set sh h j 1 rj h j 0 x rj h h j 1 j since r is a computable structure on sh can be computed uniformly from h note that sh 1 sh 2 whenever h 1 h 2 are distinct since m n 0 n rn h h sh it follows that n n 0 n rn p p h h p sh thus n n 0 n rn p can be computed uniformly from m 0 m to prove theorem 8 2 we will need the following observation proposition 8 5 suppose x m is a finite measure space and is a computable presentation of then x is a lower semi computable real proof suppose x m r thus x nr n let fn r n m n r m thus f 0 f 1 are pairwise disjoint and x n fn furthermore fn is computable uniformly from n thus x n fn is lower semi computable proof of theorem 8 2 let x 0 1 let m denote the algebra generated by the dyadic subintervals of 0 1 let r be a positive real that is not lower semicom putable whenever a m let a r m a wherem denotes lebesgue measure thus x m is a countably generated measure space since x r it follow from proposition 8 5 that does not have a computable presentation now let in n be a standard enumeration of the dyadic subintervals of 0 1 and let r n r 1 in it follows that d is a computable structure on l p for r n p m in 1 p and each sum of the form m n 0 nr n can be effectively rewritten as a sum of the form k j 0 jr nj where r n 0 r nk are disjointly supported 9 conclusion a long term goal of analytic computable structure theory should be to classify the computably categorical banach spaces among the banach spaces most en countered in practice in both pure and applied mathematics are the lp spaces so a nearer term subgoal is to classify the computably categorical lp spaces as men tioned in the introduction all such spaces must be separable and therefore their analytic computable structure theory and lp spaces 25 underlying measure spaces must be separable as shown in section 8 the com putable presentability of an lp spaces does not imply the computable presentability of its underlying measure space when analyzing the computable categoricity of lp spaces it makes sense to divide them into the lp spaces of separable atomic spaces and the lp spaces of the separable non atomic spaces here we have resolved the matter of the lp spaces of non atomic measure spaces that leaves the atomic spaces to be considered these can be divided into those that are purely atomic and those that are not every separable atomic space has countably many atoms so the purely atomic case has already been resolved namely p is computably categorical only when p 2 and pn is computably categorical for all p n 22 23 so only the lp spaces of non atomic but not purely atomic spaces remain to be examined and a future paper will do so one consequence of our main result is that when investigating the effective math ematics of lp 0 1 one need not be concerned about the choice of computable pre sentation as they all yield the same classes of computable points sequences and operators however if one wishes to do some actual computing then the question arises as to whether one presentation could be more advantageous than others ac cordingly we pose the question if p 1 is a computable real and if lp 0 1 lp 0 1 are two polynomial time computable presentations of lp 0 1 does it fol low that there is a polynomial time computable isometric isomorphism of lp 0 1 onto lp
