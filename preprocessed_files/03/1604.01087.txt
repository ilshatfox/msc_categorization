work of birkhoff and von neumann quantum logic has been interpreted as the logic of closed subspaces of a hilbert space there is a progression from the usual boolean logic of subsets to the quantum logic of subspaces of a general vector space which is then specialized to the closed subspaces of a hilbert space but there is a dual progression the notion of a partition or quotient set or equivalence relation is dual in a category theoretic sense to the notion of a subset hence the boolean logic of subsets has a dual logic of partitions then the dual progression is from that logic of partitions to the quantum logic of direct sum decompositions i e the vector space version of a set partition of a general vector space which can then be specialized to the direct sum decompositions of

sum decompositions rather than on subspaces of vector spaces this allows the logic to express measurement by any self adjoint operators rather than just the projection operators corresponding to subspaces a direct sum decomposition dsd of a vector space v over a base field k is a set of nonzero subspaces vi i i that are disjoint i e their pair wise intersections are the zero space 0 and that span the space so that each vector v v has a unique expression v i i vi with each vi vi with only a finite number of vi s nonzero for introductory purposes it is best to assume v is finite dimensional although many of the proofs are more general each self adjoint operator and in general diagonalizable operator has eigenspaces that form a direct sum decomposition of the vector space but the notion of a direct sum decomposition makes sense over arbitrary vector spaces independently of an operator for instance in the pedagogical model of quantum mechanics over sets or qm sets 12 14 the vector space is zn 2 so the only operators always assumed diagonalizable are projection operators p zn 2 zn 2 but given a set u v 1 vn of basis vectors for zn 2 any real valued random variable or function f u r determines a dsd f 1 r r f u of zn 2 where is the power set and f u is the image or spectrum of eigenvalues of the numerical attribute f thus the concept of a direct sum decomposition of a vector space allows one to capture many of the relevant properties of such a real valued observable even though it does not take values in the base field which is only z 2 in qm sets it is only as the base field is increased up to the complex numbers that all real valued observables can be internalized as self adjoint operators the genesis of the usual quantum logic of projection operators or subspaces can be seen as starting with the boolean logic of subsets in the boolean lattice u of subsets of a universe set u and taking the vector space version of a subset which is a subspace that yields the lattice of subspaces of an arbitrary vector space which can then be specialized to the lattice of closed subspaces of a hilbert space for the strictly quantum mechanical case in category theory the notion of a subobject such as a subset or subspace has a dual notion of a quotient object thus the dual concept to a subset is the concept of a quotient set equivalence relation or partition on a set u that gives rise to the idea of the logic of partitions 11 13 instead of the boolean logic of subsets the origin and topic of this paper is the vector space version of a partition namely a direct sum decomposition nb not a quotient space the analogue of a partial boolean algebra 19 is then a 2 partial partition algebra of dsds on an arbitrary vector space our topic here which can then be specialized to a hilbert space for the strictly quantum mechanical interpretation or specialized to a vector space over z 2 for pedagogical purposes figure 1 progressions from sets to vector spaces starting with dual concepts of subset and partition there is a natural partial order refinement as with partitions on sets on the dsds of a vector space v and there is a minimum element 0 v the indiscrete dsd nicknamed the blob which consists of the whole space v a dsd is atomic in the partial order if there is no dsd between it and the minimum dsd 0 and the atomic dsds are the binary ones consisting of just two subspaces each atomic dsd determines a pair of projection operators and the indiscrete dsd also determines a pair of projection operators namely the zero operator 0 and the identity operator i conversely each projection operator p v v on an arbitrary vector space v other than the identity or zero operator determines an atomic dsd consisting of the image of p and the image of i p while the identity and zero operators determine the indiscrete dsd in that sense the quantum logic of dsds extends the quantum logic of projection operators associated with atomic dsds in the quantum logic of closed subspaces only measurement of projection operators associated with atomic dsds and the blob can be represented so the quantum logic of direct sum decompositions allows the representation of the measurement of any self adjoint operators 2 the partial partition algebra of direct sum decompositions 2 1 compatibility of dsds let v be a finite dimensional vector space over a field k a direct sum decomposition dsd of v is a set of subspaces vi i i such that vi i 6 i vi 0 the zero space for i i and which span the space written i ivi v let dsd v be the set of dsds of v in the algebra of partitions on a set the operations of join meet and implication are always defined but in the context of vector space partitions i e dsds we need to define a notion of compatibility if we were dealing with operators and their associated dsds of eigenspaces then compatibility would be defined by commutativity but we are dealing with dsds directly with no assumption that they are the eigenspace dsds of operators given two dsds vi i i and wj j j their proto join is the set of non zero subspaces vi wj i j i j if the two dsds and were defined as the eigenspace dsds of two opera tors then the space spanned by the proto join would be the space spanned by the simultaneous eigenvectors of the two operators and that space would be the kernel of the commutator of the two operators if the two operators commuted then their commutator would be the zero operator whose kernel is the whole space so the proto join would span the whole space hence the natural definition of compatibility without any mention of operators is and are compatible written if the proto join spans the whole space v the indiscrete dsd 0 v the blob is compatible with all dsds i e 0 for any 3 2 2 the join of compatible dsds when two dsds are compatible the proto join is the join vi wj i j i j join of dsds when the binary relation of compatibility on dsds is reflexive and symmetric the indiscrete dsd acts as the identity for the join 0 for any dsd in a set of mutually compatible dsds we need to show that the join operation preserves com patibility if it is trivial that and but for a third dsd with and does lemma 1 let the dsds vi i i and wj j j be compatible so that vi wj i j i j is a dsd and thus any v v has a unique expression v i j i j vij where vij vi wj let vi j j vij vi so that v i i vi if v vi then v vi proof let v i i i i 6 i vi so that v vi v i then v vi v i vi if v i 6 0 then v i itself and i 6 i j vi j are two different expressions for v i of vectors in a direct sum so v i 0 theorem 2 given three dsds vi i i wj j j and xk k k that are mutually compatible i e and then proof we need to prove vi wj i j i j is compatible with xk k k i e that i j k i j k vi wj xk v consider any nonzero v v where since vij vi wj such that v i j i j vij now since for each nonzero vij vi wj vij i k vi xk such that vij i k i k vij i k but since vij vi by the lemma only vij ik is nonzero so vij k k vij ik symmetrically since for each vij vi wj vij j k wj xk such that vij j k j k vij j k but since vij wj by the lemma only vij jk is nonzero so vij k k vij jk now since xk k k is a dsd there is a unique expression for each nonzero vij k k vijk where vijk xk hence by uniqueness vijk vij ik vij jk but since vij ik vi and vij jk wj and vij ik vijk vij jk we have vijk vi wj xk thus v i j i j vij i j i j k k vijk i j k i j k vijk since v was arbitrary i j k i j k vi wj xk v 2 3 the meet of two dsds for any two dsds and the meet is the dsd whose subspaces are direct sums of subspaces from and the direct sum of subspaces from and are minimal subspaces in that regard that is yl l l is the meet if there is a set partition il l l on i and a set partition jl l l such that yl i ilvi j jlwj and that holds for no more refined partitions on the index sets if and then it is trivial that as in the movie of the same name 4 figure 2 the blob absorbs everything it meets 0 0 2 4 the refinement partial order on dsds the partial order on the dsds of v is defined as for set partitions but with subspaces replacing subsets refines written if for every vi wj such that vi wj if holds then each wj vi vi wj so and as well as as expected proposition 1 where it exists the join is the least upper bound of and proof if i e and have a common upper bound xk k k then vi xk xk vi and wj xk xk wj given a nonzero v vi wj it can be expressed uniquely as v xk vi vik where vik xk and as v xk wj vjk where vjk xk but since is a dsd there is a unique expression v k k vk so vik vjk vk where vk vi wj xk where xk vi and xi wj so xk vi wj and thus hence is the least upper bound of and corollary 1 if and have a common upper bound i e then two dsds and need not have a common upper bound so dsd v is not a join semilattice lemma 3 given a dsd vi i i let x i ixvi and y i iy vi both be direct sums of some vi s if x y is nonzero then it is also a direct sum of some vi s proof consider a nonzero v x y so there is a unique expression v i ix vi x where vi x vi x and a unique expression v i iy vi y where vi y vi y since is a dsd there is also a unique expression v i i vi so for each nonzero vi vi vi x vi y vi x y thus for any such i vi is a common direct summand to x and y so vi x y thus every nonzero element v x y is in a direct sum of vi s for vi x y and thus x y is the direct sum of vi that are common direct summands of x and y proposition 2 the meet is the greatest lower bound of and proof if then each xk vi vi xk wj wj xk by the construction of there is a set partition il l l on i and a set partition jl l l on j such that the subspaces in the meet yl are 5 yl i ilvi j jlwj and where no subsets of i smaller than il and subsets of j smaller than jl have that property since each vi is contained in some xk if i il then vi yl xk since both yl and xk are direct sums of some vi then by the lemma the nonzero subspace yl xk is also a direct sum of some vi s symmetrically since the same yl and xk are direct sums of some wj s then by the lemma the nonzero subspace yl xk is also a direct sum of some wj s but since yl is the smallest direct sum of both vi s and wj s yl xk yl i e yl xk and thus is the greatest in the refinement partial ordering lower bound on and as the blob is compatible with all dsds it is the minimum element in the ordering 0 for any hence any two dsds and always have a common lower bound so they always have a meet i e dsd v is a meet semilattice thus the partial partition algebra dsd v could also be called the meet semi lattice of dsds on a vector space v the binary dsds a 1 a 2 are the atoms of the meet semi lattice dsd v a meet semi lattice is said to be atomistic if every element is the join of the atoms below it proposition 3 the meet semi lattice dsd v is atomistic proof consider a non blob dsd vi i i if a 1 a 2 vi i i then ak vi vi ak for k 1 2 thus for any other atom a 1 a 2 the join is defined and and each nonzero subspace ak a k is the direct sum of some vi s if a join of atoms had a subspace vi 1 vi 2 i 1 i 2 i then the join with the atom vi 1 i 6 i 1 i ivi would split apart vi 1 vi 2 so the join of the atoms below gives dsd v is the quantum partition logic determined by v to be more specifically quantum v could be a finite dimensional hilbert space 3 partition logics in a partial partition algebra 3 1 the implication dsd in partition logics just as a partial boolean algebra is made up of overlapping boolean algebras so a partial partition algebra is made up of overlapping partition logics or algebras there is no maximum dsd only maximal dsds each maximal element in the partial ordering is a discrete or non degenerate dsd uk k k of one dimensional subspaces rays of v so k is the dimension of v a partition logic is determined by the set of dsds 0 dsd v compatible with a maximal element with the induced ordering and operations which is analogous to the way in a partial boolean algebra a complete set of one dimensional subspaces determines a boolean algebra 6 figure 3 partial partition logic or meet semi lattice of dsds of v with partition logics and for any so is by construction the maximum or top dsd in and thus might be symbolized as the discrete dsd 1 each subspace vi has vi uk uk vi k k so absorbs what it joins and is the unit element for meets within and all the dsds and compatible with i e are compatible with each other since they have a common upper bound explicitly each vi i i in determines a set partition on k the index set for and thus b k b dim v the bell number for the dimension of v each uk would be contained in some block of the set partition join and thus those corresponding subspaces vi wj uk uk vi wj k k would span v so in order to be properly called a logic each partition lattice has a naturally defined implication inherited from the logic of set partitions so partition logic refers to a partition lattice plus the implication operation for and for each vi the corresponding subspaces of the implication are all uk vi if wj such that vi wj vi if not since each vi uk uk vi the implication is still a dsd in spite of some of the vi being discretized into the uk contained in it in the implication dsd each vi either remains whole like a mini zero blob 0 vi vi on the space vi if vi is not contained in any wj or it is discretized into the atoms uk vi which in effect assigns a 1 to vi if wj such that vi wj in other words the implication acts like an indicator or characteristic function assigning a 1 or 0 to each vi depending on whether or not wj such that vi wj thus trivially 1 iff if we just take uk k k as a set of entities forgetting about any vector space structure then each dsd wj j j in 0 defines a set partition on uk k k where each subspace wj determines a block uk uk wj 7 indeed given any dsd vi i i each subspace wj of 0 determines a block vi vi wj so defines a set partition on thus the interval 0 is isomorphic to the set based partition logic join meet and implication operations on that set 13 as a partition lattice 0 has many of well known properties 27 5 16 chapter iv section 4 however the late development of partition logic was in part retarded by the practice of referring to the lattice of equivalence relations as the lattice of partitions where the partial order however corresponds to set inclusion for the corresponding equivalence relations 16 p 251 so instead of being refinement it is actually reverse refinement 21 p 30 the partial order on the partition lattice as defined here corresponds to set inclusion of the binary relations that are the complements of equivalence relations and are called partition relations 13 or apartness relations in the lattice of equivalence relations the top is the biggest indiscrete equivalence relation where everything is identified and the bottom is the smallest discrete equivalence relation where each element is identified only with itself whereas the partition lattice uses the opposite partial order 1 either way the lattice is complete and relatively complemented but not distributive but the reversed order reverses the join and meet the top and bottom and the atoms and coatoms 3 2 dsds cscos and measurement given a self adjoint operator l the projections p can be reconstructed from the dsd v of eigenspaces and then the operator can reconstructed given the eigenvalues from the spectral decom position l p what information about self adjoint operators is lost by dealing only with their dsds of eigenspaces the information about which eigenvalues for eigenvectors are the same or different is retained by the distinct eigenspaces in the dsd it is only the specific numerical values of the eigenvalues that is lost and those numerical values are of little importance in qm any trans formation into other real numbers that is one to one thus avoiding accidental degeneracy would do as well thus we can say that the essentials of the measurement process in qm can be translated into the language of the quantum logic of direct sum decompositions kolmogorov referred to the set partition given by the inverse image of a random variable as the experiment 20 p 6 so it is natural to abstractly represent the direct sum decomposition of eigenspaces given by a self adjoint operator as the measurement thus unlike the quantum logic of subspaces the quantum logic of direct sum decompositions can directly represent the process of measurement for any self adjoint operators rather than just projection operators given a state and a self adjoint operator l v v on a finite dimensional hilbert space the operator determines the dsd v of eigenspaces for the eigenvalues the measurement operation uses the eigenspace dsd to decompose into the unique parts given by the projections p into the eigenspaces v where p is the outcome of the projective measurement with probability pr p 2 2 the eigenspace dsd v of l is refined by one or more maximal eigenvector dsds v uk k k for each there is a set partition b on the index set k such that v is the direct sum of the uk for k b i e v k b uk if some of the v have dimension larger than one degeneracy then more measurements by commuting operators will be necessary to further decompose down to single eigenvectors if two operators commute that means that their eigenspace dsds are compatible given another self adjoint operator m v v commuting with l its eigenspace dsd w for eigenvalues ofm is compatible with v and thus has a join dsd in dsd v which is also in for one or more maximal each representing an orthonormal basis of simultaneous eigenvectors the combined measurement by the two commuting operators is just the single measurement using the join dsd 1 instead of the usual duality relation within a boolean algebra there is a duality relation between the logic of partitions and the logic of equivalence relations 13 8 dirac s notion of a complete set of commuting operators csco 9 translates into the lan guage of the quantum logic of dsds as a set of compatible dsds whose join is a maximal dsd in dsd v and thus is the maximum dsd 1 in as the join that dsd refines each of the compatible dsds the combined measurement of the csco of commuting operators is the single non degenerate measurement by the maximal dsd that is the join of their eigenspace dsds in addition to being able to naturally represent measurement the quantum logic of dsds in useful for quite different reasons there is a pedagogical model of quantum mechanics using vector spaces over z 2 called quantum mechanics over sets qm sets 12 14 whose probability calculus is a non commutative version of the classical laplace boole finite probability theory with real valued random variables such real valued random variables on a finite sample space u cannot be represented or internalized as operators on z u 2 but they can be represented by dsds on z u 2 this allows the quantum logic of dsds treatment of measurement in qm to be reproduced in an appropriate form in the pedagogical model of qm sets and that in turn allows simplified pedagogical versions of quantum results such as the two slit experiment the indeterminacy principle bell s theorem and so forth in the remainder of this introductory treatment of quantum partition logic we will focus on this pedagogical model of qm sets using vector spaces over z 2 together with an appendix on the combinatorics of dsds over finite vector spaces over gf q since qm sets uses the special case of q 2 4 review of qm sets 4 1 previous attempts to model qm over sets qm sets is a pedagogical or toy model of quantum mechanics over sets where the quantum prob ability calculus is a non commutative version of the ordinary laplace boole finite logical probability theory 22 6 and where the usual vector spaces over c for qm are replaced with vector spaces zn 2 over z 2 fix a basis for z n 2 i e a maximal dsd in dsd z n 2 and that basis set is the sample space or outcome space for the laplace boole finite probability calculus but there are many incompatible basis sets for zn 2 so in that sense the probability calculus of qm sets is a non commutative version of the laplace boole calculus quantum mechanics over sets is a bare bones e g non physical 2 logical skeleton of qm with appropriate versions of spectral decomposition the dirac brackets the norm observable attributes the born rule commutators and density matrices all in the simple setting of sets 3 but that neverthe less provides models of characteristically quantum results e g a qm sets version of the double slit experiment 14 in that manner qm sets can serve not only as a pedagogical or toy model of qm but perhaps as an engine to better elucidate qm itself by representing the quantum features in a simple setting there have been at least three previous attempts at developing a version of qm where the base field of c is replaced by z 2 28 17 and 31 since there are no inner products in vector spaces over a finite field the trick is how to define the brackets the norm and then the probability algorithm all these previous attempts use the aspect of full qm that the bras are dual vectors so the brackets take their values in the base field of z 2 for instance the schumacher westmoreland model does not make use of the idea of probability 28 p 919 and have instead only a modal interpretation 1 possibility and 0 impossibility there is a fourth category theoretic model where the objects are sets 1 but it also has the brackets taking only 0 1 values and thus has only a modal or possibilistic interpretation 2 in full qm the debroglie relations connect mathematical notions such as frequency and wave length to physical notions such as energy and momentum qm sets is non physical in the sense that it is a sets version of the pure mathematical framework of finite dimensional qm without those direct physical connections 3 given a basis set for zn 2 each vector is expressed as a subset of the basis set 9 4 2 the yoga of transporting vector space structures there is a method or yoga to transport some structures from a vector space v over a field k to a vector space v over a different field k select a basis set u for the source space v and then consider a structure on v that can be characterized in terms of the basis set u then apply the free vector space over the field k construction to u to generate the target vector space v since the source structure was defined in terms of the basis set u it can be carried over or transported to v via its basis set u this yoga can be stated in rigorous terms using category theory 24 3 the construction of the free vector space over a field k is a functor from the category sets of sets and functions to the category v ectk of vector spaces over k and linear transformations the functor will only be used here on finite sets where it takes a finite set u to the vector space ku this paper is about direct sum decompositions of a finite dimensional vector space v a dsd a set vi of disjoint subspaces so that the whole space v is their direct sum or in terms of category theory v is the coproduct v vi of the subspaces vi in the category sets a set bi of disjoint subsets of a set u is a set partition of u if bi u or in terms of category theory u is the coproduct of the disjoint subsets bi the free vector space over k functor is a left adjoint left adjoints preserve colimits 3 p 197 and coproducts are a special type of colimit hence the free vector space functor carries a set partition bi i 1 m to the dsd vi k bi of v ku kbi now start with the structure of a dsd vi on v v ectk what we previously called char acterizing the structure in terms of a basis set u is rigorously interpreted to mean in this case finding a basis u and a partition bi on u so that the given dsd vi is the image of the free vector space functor i e v ku kbi vi but then the free vector space functor over a different field k can be applied to the same set partition bi of the set u to generate a dsd v i k bi of v k u that is how to rigorously describe transporting a set based structure on a vector v over k to a vector space v over a different field k to show that any given dsd vi of v is in the image of the free vector space over k functor pick basis set bi of vi the sets bi are disjoint and since vi is a dsd the union u bi is a basis for v so vi k bi and v ku kbi this method is applied to the transporting of self adjoint operators from v cn to v zn 2 that motivates qm sets a self adjoint operator f cn cn has a basis u u 1 un of orthonormal eigenvectors and it has real distinct eigenvalues i j 1 m so it defines the real eigenvalue function f u r where for uj u f uj is one of the distinct eigenvalues i i 1 m for each distinct eigenvalue i there is the eigenspace vi of its eigenvectors and vi i 1 m is a dsd on v cn the inverse image bi f 1 i i 1 m of the eigenvalue function f u r is a set partition on u thus the set based structure we have is the set u with a partition bi f 1 i i on u induced by a real value function f u r on u that set based structure is sufficient to reconstruct the dsd vi c bi i on v cn cu cbi as well as the original operator f the operator f is defined on the basis u by fuj f uj uj for j 1 n but it might be helpful to go through the categorical construction scalar multiplication in the vector space is given by the set function c cn cn there is the injection of the generators function u cu cn and there is the function f u r c so by the universal mapping property ump of the product c cn we have the factor map f u c cn and thus the composition f u f c cn cn then we use the ump of the free vector space over c functor u c n f w ump of free vector space functor 10 that ump is that for any function u w from the set u to any vector space w over c there is a linear transformation f cn cu w such that f taking f and w cn there is a unique linear operator f on cn such that for any uj u f uj is the scalar multiple f uj u j or where we write uj uj and scalar multiplication by juxtaposition fuj f uj uj for j 1 n that process of going from the function f u r on a basis set u of cu to an operator on cu might be called internalizing the function f u r in cu given the set based structure of a real valued function f u r which determines the set partition f 1 i i 1 m on u we then apply the free vector space over z 2 functor to construct the vector space zu 2 that vector space is more familiar in the form of the powerset u zu 2 since each function u z 2 0 1 in zu 2 is the characteristic function s of a subset s u the free vector space functor z 2 takes the coproduct u mi 1 f 1 i to the dsd f 1 i of u the attempt to internalize the real function f u r would use the scalar multiplication function z 2 zu 2 zu 2 and would only work if f took values in z 2 0 1 r in which case f would be a characteristic function s for some subset s u in that special case the internalized operator would be the projection operator ps z u 2 zu 2 which in terms of the basis u has the action ps t s t taking any subset t u to s t s hence outside of characteristic functions the real valued functions f u r cannot be inter nalized as operators on zu 2 but that is fine since the idea of the model qm sets is that given a basis u of zn 2 the quantum probability calculus will just be the classical finite probability calculus with the outcome set or sample space u where f u r is a real valued random variable we have illustrated the transporting of set based structures on cn to zn 2 using a basis set u but in the stand alone model qm sets we cut the umbilical cord to cn and work with any other basis u of z n 2 and real valued random variables g u r on that sample space other structures can be transported across the bridge from cn to zn 2 qm sets differs from the other four attempts to define some toy version of qm on sets by the treatment of the dirac brackets starting with our orthonormal basis u on a finite dimensional hilbert space cn where the bracket is the inner product we need to define the transported brackets applied to two subsets s t u in u the two subsets define the vectors s u s u and t u t u in cn which have the bracket value s t s t since that value is defined just in terms of the subsets s t u as the cardinality of their overlap that value can be transported to u as the real valued basis dependent brackets s ut s t see below 4 3 laplace boole finite probability theory since our purpose is conceptual rather than mathematical we will stick to the simplest case of finite probability theory with a finite sample space or outcome space u u 1 un of n equiprobable outcomes and to finite dimensional qm 4 the events are the subsets s u and the probability of an event s occurring in a trial is the ratio of the cardinalities pr s s u given that a conditioning event s u occurs the conditional probability that t u occurs is pr t s pr t s pr s t s s the ordinary probability pr t of an event t can be taken as the conditional probability with u as the conditioning event so all probabilities can be seen as conditional probabilities given a real valued random variable f u r on the elements of u the probability of observing a value r given an event s is the conditional probability of the event f 1 r given s pr r s f 1 r s s 4 the mathematics can be generalized to the case where each point uj in the sample space has a probability pj when it is a basis set with point probabilities that is transported but the simpler case of equiprobable points serves our conceptual purposes 11 that is all the probability theory we will need here our first task is to show how the mathematics of finite probability theory can be recast using the mathematical notions of quantum mechanics with the base field of z 2 4 4 vector spaces over z 2 to show how classical laplace boole finite probability theory can be recast as a quantum probability calculus we use finite dimensional vector spaces over z 2 the power set u of u u 1 un is a vector space over z 2 0 1 isomorphic to zn 2 where the vector addition s t is the symmetric difference of subsets that is for s t u s t s t t s s t s t so the members of s t are the elements that are members of s or members of t but not members of both the u basis in u is the set of singletons u 1 u 2 un i e the set uj j 1 n in the context of dsd zn 2 that basis set would correspond to the maximal element uj j 1 n where uj is the one dimensional subspace uj a vector s u is specified in the u basis as s uj s uj and it is characterized by its z 2 valued characteristic function s u z 2 r of coefficients since s uj u s uj uj consider the simple case of u a b c where the u basis is a b and c the three subsets a b b c and a b c also form a basis since b c a b c a b c a b a b c b and a b a b c c these new basis vectors could be considered as the basis singletons in another equicardinal sample space u a b c where a b and c refer to the same abstract vector as a b b c and a b c respectively in the following ket table each row is an abstract vector of z 32

products in vector spaces over finite fields the different attempts to develop a toy model of qm over a finite field 28 31 17 such as z 2 differ from this model in how they 12 address this problem the treatment of the dirac brackets and norm defined here is distinguished by the fact that the resulting probability calculus in qm sets is a non commutative version of classical finite probability theory instead of just a modal calculus with values 0 and 1 for a singleton basis vector uj u the basis dependent bra uj u u r is defined by the bracket u us 1 if u s 0 if u s uj s s uj note that the bra and the bracket is defined in terms of the u basis and that is indicated by the u subscript on the bra portion of the bracket then for uj uk u uj u uk uk uj uj uk jk the kronecker delta function which is the qm sets version of vj vk jk for an orthonormal basis vj of cn the bracket linearly extends in the natural numbers n r to any two vectors t s u 5 t us t s this is the qm sets version of the dirac brackets in the mathematics of qm as noted above this treatment of the brackets is motivated by the general heuristic for trans porting basis set defined structures between vector spaces over different fields e g from cn to zn 2 in both cases the bracket gives a measure of the overlap or indistinctness of the two vectors 6 the ket s is the same as the ket s for some subset s u in another u basis but when the bra uj u is applied to the ket s s then it is the subset s u not s u that comes outside the ket symbol in uj us uj s 7 heuristically the bra t u can be thought of as a row vector of zeros and ones expressed in the u basis and then the ket s is expressed as a column vector in the u basis and t us is their dot product computed in the reals the u norm s u u r is defined as usual as the square root of the bracket 8 s u s us s s s for s u which is the qm sets version of the norm in ordinary qm hence s 2 u s is the counting measure on u note that a ket has to be expressed in the u basis to apply the u norm definition so for example a u 2 since a a b 4 6 numerical attributes linear operators and dsds in classical physics the observables are numerical attributes e g the assignment of a position and momentum to particles in phase space one of the differences between classical and quantum physics is the replacement of these observable numerical attributes by linear operators associated with the 5 here t us t s takes values in the natural numbers n outside the base field of z 2 just like say the hamming distance function dh t s t s on vector spaces over z 2 in coding theory 25 thus the size of overlap bra t u u n is not to be confused with the dual parity of overlap functional t uj t uj u z 2 where uj uk jk for u u 1 un 6 one possible misinterpretation of qm sets is to misinterpret the transporting method as an embedding zn 2 cn defined by uj 7 uj using a basis for each space but such an embedding from a vector space over a field of finite characteristic to a vector space of characteristic zero cannot be linear the repeated sum of a nonzero element in the domain space will eventually be 0 but its repeated nonzero image in the codomain space can never be 0 indeed in qm sets the brackets t us t s for t t s u should be thought of only as a measure of the overlap since they are not even linear e g t t us 6 t us t us whenever t t 6 7 the term uj s is not even defined in general since it is the intersection of subsets uj u and s u of two different universe sets u and u 8 we use the double line notation s u for the u norm of a set to distinguish it from the single line notation s for the cardinality of a set we also use the double line notation for the norm in qm although sometimes the single line notation is used elsewhere 13 observables where the values of the observables appear as eigenvalues of the operators but this difference may be smaller than it would seem at first since a numerical attribute f u r can be recast into an operator like format in qm sets where it determines direct sum decomposition of eigenspaces and there is even a qm sets analogue of spectral decomposition an observable i e a self adjoint operator on a finite dimensional hilbert space v has a home basis set of orthonormal eigenvectors using the transport method a real valued attribute f u r defined on u u 1 un has the u basis for u zn 2 as a home basis set the connection between the numerical attributes f u r of qm sets and the self adjoint operators of full qm can also be established by seeing the function f as being like an operator f on u in that it is used to define a sets version of an eigenvalue equation where f s is the restriction of f to s u for any subset s u the definition of the equation is f s is holds df f is constant on the subset s with the value i this is the qm sets version of an eigenvalue equation for arbitrary functions on a set f u r whenever s satisfies f s is for some i then s is said to be an eigenvector level set in the vector space u of the numerical attribute f u r and i r is the associated eigenvalue constant value on a level set each eigenvalue i determines as usual an eigenspace f 1 i of its eigenvectors which is a subspace of the vector space u zn 2 the whole space u can be expressed as usual as the direct sum of the eigenspaces u i f u f 1 i so f 1 i i f u is a dsd in dsd zn 2 since f u r does not define an operator z n 2 zn 2 unless it is a characteristic function we see one of the reasons for developing quantum partition logic using dsds moreover for distinct eigenvalues i 6 i any corresponding eigenvectors s f 1 i and t f 1 i are orthogonal in the sense that t us 0 in general for vectors s t u orthogonality means zero overlap i e disjointness the characteristic function s u r for s u has the eigenvalues of 0 and 1 so it is a numerical attribute that can be internalized as a linear operator s u u hence in this case the eigenvalue equation f t it for f s internalizes as an actual eigenvalue equation s t it for a linear 9 operator s with the resulting eigenvalues of 1 and 0 and with the resulting eigenspaces s and sc where sc is the complement of s and atomic dsd s sc the characteristic attributes s u r are characterized by the property that their value wise product i e s s uj s uj s uj is equal to the attribute value s uj and that is reflected in the idempotency of the corresponding operators u s u s u u s u thus the operators s corresponding to the characteristic functions s are projection operators the maximum eigenvectors f 1 r for f with i in the image or spectrum f u r span the set u i e u i f u f 1 i hence the attribute f u r has a spectral decomposition in terms of its projection defining characteristic functions f m i 1 i f 1 i u r spectral decomposition of real valued function f u r which is the qm sets version of the spectral decomposition f m i 1 ipi of a self adjoint operator f in terms of the projection operators pi for its eigenvalues i 9 it should be noted that the projection operator s u u is not only idempotent but linear i e s t 1 s t 2 s t 1 t 2 indeed this is the distributive law when u is interpreted as a boolean ring with intersection as multiplication 14 4 7 the born rule for measurement in qm and qm sets an orthogonal decomposition of a finite set u is just a partition b of u since the blocks b b are orthogonal i e disjoint and their union which is a disjoint union is u given such a disjoint union decomposition of u we have the u 2 u b b 2 u pythagorean theorem for disjoint union decompositions of sets an old question is why the squaring in the born rule of qm a superposition state between certain definite orthogonal alternatives a and b where the latter are represented by vectors a and b is represented by the vector sum c a b but what is the strength intensity or relative importance of the vectors a and b in the vector sum c that question requires a scalar measure of strength or intensity the magnitude or length given by the norm does not answer the question since a b 6 c but the pythagorean theorem shows that the norm squared gives the scalar measure of intensity that answers the question a 2 b 2 c 2 in vector spaces over z 2 or over c and when the superposition state is reduced by a measurement then the probability that the indefinite state will reduce to one of the definite alternatives is given by that relative scalar measure of the eigen alternative s strength or intensity and that is the born rule in a slogan born is the off spring of pythagoras given an observable operator f in ordinary qm c and a numerical attribute in qm sets the corresponding pythagorean theorems for the complete sets of orthogonal projection operators are 2 i pi 2 and s 2 u i f 1 i s 2 u i f 1 i s s normalizing gives i pi 2 2 1 and i f 1 i s 2 u s 2 u i f 1 i s s 1 so the non negative summands can be interpreted as probabilities which is the born rule in qm and in qm sets 10 here pi 2 2 is the quantum probability of getting i in an f measurement of while f 1 i s 2 u s 2 u f 1 i s s has the classical interpretation as the probability pr i s of the numerical attribute f u r having the eigenvalue i when measuring s u thus the qm sets version of the born rule is the perfectly ordinary laplace boole rule for the conditional probability pr i s f 1 i s s that given an event s on the sample space u a random variable f u r takes the value i in qm sets when the state s is being measured using the observable f where the probability pr i s of getting the eigenvalue i is f 1 ir s 2 u s 2 u f 1 i s s the damned quantum jump schro dinger goes from s by the projection operator f 1 i to the projected resultant state 10 note that there is no notion of a normalized vector in a vector space over z 2 another consequence of the lack of an inner product the normalization is as it were postponed to the probability algorithm which is computed in the reals this external probability algorithm is internalized when z 2 is strengthened to c in going from qm sets to full qm 15 f 1 i s which is in the eigenspace f 1 i for that eigenvalue i the state resulting from the measurement represents a more definite state f 1 i s that now has the definite f value of i so a second measurement would yield the same eigenvalue i with probability pr i f 1 i s f 1 i f 1 i s f 1 i s f 1 i s f 1 i s 1 and the same resulting vector f 1 i f 1 i s f 1 i s using the idempotency of the projection operators this treatment of measurement in qm sets is just the set version of the treatment of measure ment in standard dirac von neumann qm 4 8 summary of qm sets and qm the qm set versions of the corresponding qm notions are summarized in the following table for the finite u basis of the z 2 vector space u zn 2 and for a finite dimensional hilbert space v qm sets over z 2 standard qm over c projections s u u p v v where p 2 p spectral decomposition f i i f 1 i f i ipi

s 2 u f 1 i s s pr i pi 2 2 probability calculus for qm sets over z 2 and for standard qm over c the word logic is thrown around quite loosely as in constant references to the logic of this and that but there is a clear sense in which zn 2 is logical since given a basis set u it is isomorphic to the powerset u with the symmetric difference as the vector sum and each ket in z n 2 represented in the u coordinates is just a subset of u hence the transporting of the structures of the observables and the probability algorithm from a hilbert space cn to zn 2 can be seen as extracting the logical skeleton of qm in qm sets and in that sense qm sets can also be seen as a logic of qm 5 measurement in qm sets 5 1 set partitions and dsds in vector spaces over z 2 the language of sets e g s u can be translated into the language of vector spaces over z 2 e g s u z u 2 qm sets uses either language depending on the context a set partition b on set u is a disjoint union decomposition of u b b and the vector space partition b b is a direct sum decomposition of the vector space u b b in particular a real valued numerical attribute f u z defines both a set partition of constant sets f 1 r r f u and 16 a dsd of eigenspaces f 1 r r f u given an attribute f u r on a basis set u and an attribute g u r on a different equicardinal basis set u for zn 2 the two attributes or observables are compatible if their corresponding dsds f 1 r r f u and g 1 s s g u are compatible i e if the proto join f 1 r g 1 s r f u s g u spans the whole space then choosing a basis set for the nonzero subspaces f 1 r g 1 s yields a basis set u of simultaneous eigenvectors so that the two attributes can each be redefined on u so as to determine the same dsds and hence we can always consider compatible attributes as being defined on the same basis set which we can take as u measurement will later be treated using density matrices but we can begin with a simpler framework in the correspondences between qm sets and qm a block s in a partition on u i e a vector s u corresponds to pure state in qm and a partition b on u is the mixed state of orthogonal pure states b with the probabilities pb b u in qm a measurement makes distinctions i e makes alternatives distinguishable and that turns a pure state into a mixture of probabilistic outcomes a measurement of an attribute f u r in qm sets is the distinction creating process that uses the set partition f 1 r r f u of u to decompose or decohere a pure state s u into a mixed state set partition f 1 r s r f u on s obtained by applying the decomposing operations f 1 r to s with the block f 1 r s having the probability pr r s f 1 r s s alternatively this could be described in vector space terms a measurement of an attribute f u r in qm sets is the distinction creating process that uses the dsd f 1 r r f u to decompose a vector s u into the parts obtained by applying the projection operators f 1 r u u to the vector s with each part having the probability pr r s f 1 r s 2 u s 2 u f 1 r s s either way this is just the pedagogical qm sets version of the full qm measurement of a given state using an observable operator f p where the state projects to the parts p which occur with the probabilities pr p 2 2 5 2 weyl s anticipation of qm sets the pedagogical model qm sets could be seen as a development of some of the hints in hermann weyl s expository writings about quantum mechanics he called a partition a grating or sieve 11 and then considered both set partitions and vector space partitions direct sum decompositions as the respective types of gratings 32 pp 255 257 he started with a numerical attribute on a set e g f u r in my notation which defined the set partition or grating 32 p 255 with blocks having the same attribute value e g f 1 r r f u then he moved to the qm case where the universe set e g u u 1 un or aggregate of n states has to be replaced by an n dimensional euclidean vector space 32 p 256 12 the appropriate notion of a vector space partition or grating is a splitting of the total vector space into mutually orthogonal subspaces so that each vector x splits into r component vectors lying in the several subspaces 32 p 256 i e a direct sum decomposition of the space after referring to a partition as a grating or sieve 11 arthur eddington made a very early use of the sieve idea in einstein s theory of relativity the observer is a man who sets out in quest of truth armed with a measuring rod in quantum theory he sets out armed with a sieve 10 p 267 this passage was quoted by weyl 32 p 255 in his treatment of gratings 12 in his expository popular writings weyl used a euclidean space instead of a hilbert space 17 weyl notes that measurement means application of a sieve or grating 32 p 259 in qm sets this application of the set grating or set partition f 1 r r f u to the pure state s gives the mixed state set partition f 1 r s r f u of s in terms of the dsd f 1 r r f u determined by the attribute f u r this is just decomposing the vector s into the disjoint parts s r f u f 1 r s where f 1 r s f 1 r by the projection postulate the state s projects to one of its parts f 1 r s with the probability pr r s f 1 r s s for some visual imagery of measurement we might think of a grating or sieve as a series of regular polygonal shaped holes that might shape an indefinite blob of dough for illustrative purposes we say the blob of dough is the sum of the more definite shapes in a measurement the blob of dough falls through one of the polygonal holes in the grating with equal probability and then takes on or projects to that shape figure 4 measurement as randomly giving an indefinite blob of dough a definite polygonal shape 5 3 example of measurements in the simple example illustrated below we start at the one block or state of the indiscrete partition or blob which is a b c a measurement uses some attribute that defines an inverse image partition on u a b c in the case at hand there are essentially four possible attributes that could be used to measure the state a b c since there are four partitions that refine the indiscrete partition for an example of a degenerate measurement we choose an attribute with a non discrete inverse image partition such as the partition a b c which determines a non maximal dsd a b c hence the attribute could just be the characteristic function b c with the two eigenspaces a and b c and the two eigenvalues 0 and 1 respectively since the eigenspace 1 b c 1 b c is not one dimensional the eigenvalue of 1 is a qm sets version of a degenerate eigenvalue this attribute b c has four non zero eigenvectors b c b c 1 b c b c b 1 b b c c 1 c and b c a 0 a the measuring apparatus makes distinctions by joining the attribute s inverse image partition 1 b c 1 b c 1 1 b c 0 b c a with the pure state representing the indefinite entity u a b c the action on the pure state is u u 1 b c 1 b c b c a 18 the measurement of that attribute returns one of the eigenvalues with the probabilities pr 0 u a a b c a b c 1 3 and pr 1 u b c a b c a b c 2 3 suppose it returns the eigenvalue 1 then the indefinite entity a b c reduces to the projected eigenstate 1 b c 1 a b c b c for that eigenvalue 7 p 221 since this is a degenerate result i e the eigenspace 1 b c 1 b c doesn t have dimension one another measurement is needed to make more distinctions measurements by at tributes such as a b or a c that give either of the other two partitions a b c or b a c as inverse images would suffice to distinguish b c into b or c then either at tribute together with the attribute b c would form a complete set of compatible attributes or csca i e the qm sets version of dirac s complete set of commuting operators or csco where complete means that the join of the attributes inverse image partitions gives the discrete partition and where compatible means that all the attributes can be taken as defined on the same set of simultaneous basis eigenvectors e g the u basis taking for example the other attribute as a b the join of the two attributes partitions is discrete 1 b c 1 a b a b c a b c a b c 1 hence all the eigenstate singletons can be characterized by the ordered pairs of the eigenvalues of these two attributes a 0 1 b 1 1 and c 1 0 using dirac s ket notation to give the ordered pairs and listing the eigenvalues of b c first on the left the second projective measurement of the indefinite entity b c using the attribute a b with the inverse image partition 1 a b a b c would have the pure to mixed state action b c b c a b 1 b c a b 0 b c the distinction making measurement would cause the indefinite entity b c to turn into one of the definite entities of b or c with the probabilities pr 1 b c a b b c b c 1 2 and pr 0 b c c b c b c 1 2 if the measured eigenvalue is 0 then the state b c projects to 1 a b 0 b c c as pictured below figure 5 degenerate measurement the two projective measurements of a b c using the complete set of compatible e g both defined on u attributes b c and a b produced the respective eigenvalues 1 and 0 so the resulting eigenstate was characterized by the eigenket 1 0 c again this is all analogous to standard dirac von neumann quantum mechanics 19 5 4 density matrices in qm sets the previous treatment of the role of partitions in measurement can be restated using density matrices over the reals given a partition b on u u 1 un the blocks b can be thought of as nonoverlapping or orthogonal pure states where the state b occurs with the probability pb b u then we can transport the usual procedure for forming the density matrix for the orthogonal pure states b with the probabilities pb the pure state b normalized in the reals to length 1 is represented by the column vector b 1 1 b b u 1 b un t where t indicates the transpose then the density matrix b for the pure state b u is then calculating in the reals b b 1 b 1 t 1 b b u 1 b u 2 b un b u 1 b un 1 b b u 1 b u 1 b u 2 b u 1 b un b u 2 b u 1 b u 2 b u 2 b un b un b u 1 b un b u 2 b un for instance if u u 1 u 2 u 3 then for the blocks in the partition u 1 u 2 u 3 u 1 u 2 1 2 1 2 0 1 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 and u 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 then the mixed state density matrix of the partition is the weighted sum b pb b in the example this is 2 3 1 2 1 2 0 1 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 3 1 3 0 1 3 1 3 0 0 0 1 3 in partition logic 13 given a set partition b b on a universe set u an ordered pair u u u u is called a distinction or dit of if the elements are in different blocks of and the set of all distinctions is the dit set dit an ordered pair u u is called an indistinction or indit of if the two elements are in the same block of and the set of all indistinctions is the indit set indit a partition has an associated binary equivalence relation which is its indit set indit u u and an associated partition relation or apartness relation which is the complementary dit set dit u u indit the density matrix of the partition can then be directly interpreted in terms of its indit set jk 1 u if uj uk indit 0 if uj uk indit all the entries are real amplitudes whose squares are the two draw probabilities of drawing a pair of elements from u with replacement that is an indistinction of like in the full quantum case the non zero entries of the density matrix jk 1 u 1 u 1 u are the coherences 7 p 302 20 which indicate that uj and uk cohere together in a block or pure state of the partition i e for some block b uj uk b since the ordered pairs uj uj in the diagonal u u are always indits of any partition the diagonal entries in are always 1 u combinatorial theory gives a natural way to define the same density matrix of a partition a binary relation r u u on u u 1 un can be represented by an n n incidence matrix i r where i r jk 1 if uj uk r 0 if uj uk r taking r as the equivalence relation indit associated with a partition the density matrix defined above is just the incidence matrix i indit rescaled to be of trace 1 i e sum of diagonal entries is 1 1 u i indit 5 5 measurement in qm sets using density matrices if the subsets t u are represented by the n ary column vectors t u 1 t un t then the action of the projection operator b u u is represented in the u basis by the n n diagonal matrix pb where the diagonal entries are pb jj 1 if uj b 0 if uj b b uj which is idempotent p 2 b pb and symmetric p t b pb for any state s u the trace sum of diagonal entries of pb s is tr pb s 1 s n j 1 s uj b uj b s s pr b s so given f u r pr r s f 1 r s s tr pf 1 r s this is the qm sets version of the usual result pr p 2 2 tr p given a state s the measurement by the f attribute dsd f 1 r r f u projects s to the state f 1 r s with the probability tr pf 1 r s f 1 r s s pr r s we need to convert this into the language of density matrices starting with the pure state s as a normalized column vector s 1 the subset f 1 r s resulting from that projection is the column vector pf 1 r s to calculate the corresponding density matrix we must first normalize the column vector pf 1 r s by dividing through by f 1 r s where nonzero but the normalizing factor to compute s was s i e s 1 1 s s since tr pf 1 r s f 1 r s s the normalized version of pf 1 r s is 1 f 1 r s pf 1 r s 1 f 1 r s pf 1 r s s 1 1 tr pf 1 r s pf 1 r s 1 hence the density matrix corresponding to the projected state pf 1 r s is 1 tr pf 1 r s pf 1 r s 1 pf 1 r s 1 t 1 tr pf 1 r s pf 1 r s 1 s 1 t pf 1 r t p f 1 r s p f 1 r tr pf 1 r s 21 this might be illustrated by using the second part of the above degenerate measurement where f a b and s b c then the density matrix is b c 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 2 0 1 2 1 2 and 1 a b 1 f 1 1 a b so pf 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 pf 1 1 b c 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 2 0 1

density matrix for the pure state c f 1 0 b c c b c the final formula for the post measurement mixed state s would weigh the projected states by their probability so we have s r f u pr r s p f 1 r s p f 1 r tr pf 1 r s r f u tr pf 1 r s p f 1 r s p f 1 r tr pf 1 r s r f u pf 1 r s pf 1 r thus the action of the measurement is s s r f u pf 1 r s pf 1 r measurement of s using f attribute in density matrix form this result is just the transported qm sets version of the description of measurement in full qm consider the projective measurement using a self adjoint operator f on v with the dsd v of eigenspaces and the projections to the eigenspaces p v v the measurement of a normalized pure state results in the state p with the probability p tr p pr where the projected resultant state p has the density matrix p p tr p p p tr p so the mixed state describing the probabilistic results of the measurement is 26 p 101 or p 515 22 p p p tr p tr p p p tr p p p thus we see how the density matrix treatment of measurement in qm sets is just a sets version of the density matrix treatment of projective measurement in standard dirac von neumann qm 7 p p 6 final remarks the usual version of quantum logic can be viewed as the extension of the boolean logic of subsets to the logic of subspaces of a vector space specifically closed subspaces of a hilbert space since the notion of a set partition or equivalence relation or quotient set is the category theoretic dual to the notion of a subset the logic of set partitions is in that sense dual to the boolean logic of subsets hence there is a dual form of quantum logic that can be viewed as the extension of the logic of set partitions to the logic of direct sum decompositions of a vector space specifically a hilbert space the usual quantum logic of subspaces can be viewed as focusing on propositions i e the proposi tion that a given state vector is in a subspace and projection operators since a self adjoint operator observable determines a direct sum decomposition losing only the specific numerical eigenvalues the quantum logic of dsds can be viewed as focusing on observables or self adjoint operators ab stracted from specific eigenvalues with the two projection operators associated with a proposition and its negation included in the form of the atomic dsds and the blob unlike the quantum logic of subspaces the logic of dsds vector space partitions provides the natural setting to model measurement since as weyl put it measurement means application of a sieve or grating 32 p 259 in this introductory treatment we have focused on first developing that quantum logic of direct sum decompositions of a general finite dimensional vector space v over a field k then we turned to the special case of the quantum logic of direct sum decompositions of a finite vector space over z 2 which applies to the pedagogical model of quantum mechanics over sets qm sets the logical skeleton of qm in the appendix we give an elementary treatment of combinatorics of dsds of finite vector spaces over finite fields with q elements with some numerical calculations and examples for the special case of qm sets where q 2 7

function for the numbers 4 29 our goal is to derive by elementary methods the formulas to enumerate these and some related direct sum decompositions two subspaces of a vector space are said to be disjoint if their intersection is the zero subspace 0 a direct sum decomposition dsd of a finite dimensional vector space v over a base field k is a set of nonzero pair wise disjoint subspaces called blocks as with partitions vi i 1 m that span the space then each vector v v has a unique expression v m i 1 vi with each vi vi since a direct sum decomposition can be seen as the vector space version of a set partition we begin with counting the number of partitions on a set each set partition b 1 bm of an n element set has a type or signature number partition giving the cardinality of the blocks where they might be presented in nondecreasing order which we can assume to be b 1 b 2 bm which is a number partition of n for our purposes there is another way to present number partitions the part count representation where ak is the number of times the integer k occurs in the number partition and ak 0 if k does not appear so that a 11 a 22 ann n k 1 akk n part count representation of number partitions keeping track of repetitions each set partition b 1 bm of an n element set has a part count signature a 1 an and then there is a classical formula for the number of partitions with that signature 2 p 215 18 p 427 24 proposition 4 the number of set partitions for the given signature a 1 an where n k 1 akk n is n a 1 a 2 an 1 a 1 2 a 2 n an proof suppose we count the number of set partitions b 1 bm of an n element set when the blocks have the given cardinalities nj bj for j 1 m so m j 1 nj n the first block b 1 can be chosen in n n 1 ways the second block in n n 1 n 2 ways and so forth so the total number of ways is n n 1 n n 1 n 2 n n 1 nm 1 nm n n 1 n n 1 n n 1 n 2 n n 1 n 2 n n 1 nm 1 nm n n 1 nm n n 1 nm n n 1 nm the multinomial coefficient this formula can then be restated in terms of the part count signature a 1 an where n k 1 akk n as n 1 a 1 2 a 2 n an but that overcounts since the ak blocks of size k can be permuted without changing the partition s signature so one needs to divide by ak for k 1 n which yields the formula for the number of partitions with that signature the stirling numbers s n m of the second kind are the number of partitions of an n element set with m blocks since n k 1 ak m is the number of blocks the direct formula as opposed to a recurrence formula is s n m 1 a 1 2 a 2 nan n a 1 a 2 an m n a 1 a 2 an 1 a 1 2 a 2 n an direct formula for stirling numbers of the second kind the bell numbers b n are the total number of partitions on an n element set so the direct formula is b n n m 1 s n m 1 a 1 2 a 2 nan n n a 1 a 2 an 1 a 1 2 a 2 n an direct formula for total number of partitions of an n element set 7 2 2 the direct formulas for counting dsds of finite vector spaces each dsd vi i 1 m of a finite vector space of dimension n also determines a number partition of n using the dimensions ni dim vi in place of the set cardinalities and thus each dsd also has a signature a 1 an where the subspaces are ordered by nondecreasing dimension and where n k 1 akk n and n k 1 ak m proposition 5 the number of dsds of a vector space v of dimension n over gf q with the part count signature a 1 an is 1 a 1 a 2 an n q 1 q a 1 n q an q 1 2 n 2 k akk 2 number of dsds for the given signature a 1 an where n k 1 akk n proof reasoning first in terms of the dimensions ni we calculate the number of ordered bases in a subspace of dimension n 1 of a vector space of dimension n over the finite field gf q with q elements there are qn elements in the space so the first choice for a basis vector is qn 1 excluding 0 and since that vector generated a subspace of dimension q the choice of the second basis vector is limited to qn q elements and so forth thus 25 qn 1 qn q qn q 2 qn qn 1 1 qn 1 q 1 qn 1 1 q 2 qn 1 1 qn 1 1 qn n 1 1 1 qn 1 qn 1 1 qn n 1 1 1 q 1 2 n 1 1 qn 1 qn 1 1 qn n 1 1 1 q n 1 2 number of ordered bases for an n 1 dimensional subspace of an n dimensional space if we then divide by the number of ordered bases for an n 1 dimension space qn 1 1 qn 1 q qn 1 qn 1 1 qn 1 1 qn 1 1 1 q 1 q 1 2 n 1 1 we could cancel the qn 1 n 1 1 2 q n 1 2 terms to obtain the gaussian binomial coefficient qn 1 qn 1 1 qn n 1 1 1 q 1 2 n 1 1 qn 1 1 qn 1 1 1 q 1 q 1 2 n 1 1 n n 1 q n q n n 1 q n 1 q number of different n 1 dimensional subspaces of an n dimensional space if instead we continue to develop the numerator by multiplying by the number of ordered bases for an n 2 dimensional space that could be chosen from the remaining space of dimension n n 1 to obtain qn 1 qn q qn q 2 qn qn 1 1 qn qn 1 qn qn 1 1 qn qn 1 n 2 1 qn 1 qn 1 1 qn n 1 n 2 1 1 q 1 2 n 1 n 2 1 then dividing by the number of ordered bases of an n 1 dimensional space times the number of ordered bases of an n 2 dimensional space gives the number of different disjoint i e only overlap is zero subspace subspaces of n 1 dimensional and n 2 dimensional subspaces qn 1 qn 1 1 qn n 1 n 2 1 1 q 1 2 n 1 n 2 1 qn 1 1 qn 1 1 1 q 1 q 1 2 n 1 1 qn 2 1 qn 2 1 1 q 1 q 1 2 n 2 1 continuing in this fashion we arrive at the number of disjoint subspaces of dimensions n 1 n 2 nm where m i 1 ni n qn 1 qn 1 1 q 1 q 1 2 n 1 i 1 m qni 1 qni 1 1 q 1 q 1 2 ni 1 n q qn n 1 2 n 1 q q n 1 n 1 1 2 nm q q nm nm 1 2 n q n 1 q nm q q 1 2 n n 1 m i 1 ni ni 1 there may be a number ak of subspaces with the same dimension e g if nj nj 1 k then ak 2 so the term nj q q nj nj 1 2 nj 1 q q nj 1 nj 1 1 2 in the denominator could be replaced by k q ak qakk k 1 2 hence the previous result could be rewritten in the part count representation n q 1 q a 1 n q an q 1 2 n n 1 k akk k 1 and permuting subspaces of the same dimension k yields a dsd with the same signature so we need to divide by ak to obtain the formula n q a 1 an 1 q a 1 n q an q 1 2 n n 1 k akk k 1 the exponent on the q term can be simplified since k akk n 1 2 n n 1 k akk k 1 12 n 2 n k akk 2 k akk 1 2 n 2 n k akk 2 n 1 2 n 2 k akk 2 26 this yields the final formula for the number of dsds with the part count signature a 1 an n q a 1 an 1 q a 1 n q an q 1 2 n 2 k akk 2 note that the formula is not obtained by a simple substitution of k q for k in the set partition formula due to the extra term q 1 2 n 2 k akk 2 but that it still reduces to the classical formula for set partitions with that signature as q 1 this formula leads directly to the vector space version of the stirling numbers of the second kind to count the dsds with m parts and to the vector space version of the bell numbers to count the total number of dsds before giving those formulas it should be noted that there is another q analog formula called generalized stirling numbers of the second kind but it generalizes only one of the recurrence formulas for s n m it does not generalize the interpretation number of set partitions on an n element set with m parts to count the vector space partitions dsds of finite vector spaces of dimension n with m parts the stirling numbers satisfy the recurrence formula s n 1 m ms n m s n 1 m with s 0 m 0 m donald knuth uses the braces notation for the stirling numbers n m s n m and then he defines the generalized stirling number 18 p 436 n m q by the q analog recurrence relation n 1 m q 1 q qm 1 n m q n m 1 q 0 m q 0 m it is easy to generalize the direct formula for the stirling numbers and it generalizes the partition interpretation dq n m 1 a 1 2 a 2 nan n a 1 a 2 an m n q a 1 an 1 q a 1 n q an q 1 2 n 2 k akk 2 number of dsds of a finite vector space of dimension n over gf q with m parts the number dq n m is snm in 29 taking q 1 yields the stirling numbers of the second kind i e d 1 n m s n m knuth s generalized stirling numbers n m q and dq n m start off the same e g 0 0 q 1 dq 0 0 and 1 1 q 1 dq 1 1 but then quickly diverge for instance all n n q 1 for all n whereas the special case of dq n n is the number of dsds of 1 dimensional subspaces in a finite vector space of dimension n overgf q see table below for q 2 the formula dq n n is m n in 30 example 5 5 2 b pp 45 6 or 29 example 2 2 p 75 the number dq n n of dsds of 1 dimensional subspaces is closely related to the number of basis sets the old formula for that number of bases is 23 p 71 1 n qn 1 qn q qn qn 1 1 n qn 1 qn 1 1 q 1 1 q 1 2 n 1 1 n n q q n 2 q 1 n since k q qk 1 q 1 for k 1 n in the formula for dq n n there is only one signature a 1 n and ak 0 for k 2 n which immediately gives the formula for the number of dsds with n 1 dimensional blocks and each 1 dimensional block has q 1 choices for a basis vector so the total number of sets of basis vectors is given by the same formula dq n n q 1 n n q a 1 q 1 2 n 2 a 11 2 q 1 n 1 n n q q n 2 q 1 n 27 note that for q 2 q 1 n 1 so d 2 n n is the number of different basis sets summing the dq n m for all m gives the vector space version of the bell numbers b n dq n n m 1 dq n m 1 a 1 2 a 2 nan n 1 a 1 a 2 an n q 1 q a 1 n q an q 1 2 n 2 k akk 2 number of dsds of a vector space of dimension n over gf q our notation dq n is dn q in bender and goldman 4 and qn in stanley 29 30 setting q 1 gives the bell numbers i e d 1 n b n 7 3 counting dsds with a block containing a designated vector v set partitions have a property not shared by vector space partitions i e dsds given a designated element u of the universe set u the element is contained in some block of every partition on u but given a nonzero vector v in a space v it is not necessarily contained in a block of any given dsd of v some proofs of formulas use this property of set partitions so the proofs do not generalize to dsds consider one of the formulas for the stirling numbers of the second kind s n m n 1 k 0 n 1 k s k m 1 summation formula for s n m the proof using the designated element u reasoning starts with the fact that any partition of u with u n with m blocks will have one block containing u so we then only need to count the number of m 1 blocks on the subset disjoint from the block containing u if the block containing u had n k elements there are n 1 k blocks that could be complementary to an n k element block containing u and each of those k element blocks had s k m 1 partitions on it with m 1 blocks hence the total number of partitions on an n element set with m blocks is that sum this reasoning can be extended to dsds over finite vector spaces but it only counts the number of dsds with a block containing a designated nonzero vector v it doesn t matter which one not all dsds furthermore it is not a simple matter of substituting n 1 k q for n 1 k each n k element subset has a unique k element subset disjoint from it its complement but the same does not hold in general vector spaces thus given a subspace with n k dimensions we must compute the number of k dimensional subspaces disjoint from it let v be an n dimensional vector space over gf q and let v be a specific nonzero vector in v in a dsd with an n k dimensional block containing v how many k dimensional subspaces are there disjoint from the n k dimensional subspace containing v the number of ordered basis sets for a k dimensional subspace disjoint from the given n k dimensional space is qn qn k qn qn k 1 qn qn 1 qk 1 qn k qk 1 1 qn k 1 q 1 qn 1 qk 1 qk 1 1 q 1 q n k n k 1 n 1 qk 1 qk 1 1 q 1 qk n k 12 k k 1 since we use the usual trick to evaluate twice the exponent n k n k 1 n 1 n 1 n 2 n k 2 n k 1 2 n k 1 k 2 n k 1 2 k k n k k 2 k 2 k n k k 2 k now the number of ordered basis set of a k dimensional space is qk 1 qk 1 1 q 1 q 12 k k 1 28 so dividing by that gives qk n k the number of k dimensional subspaces disjoint from any n k dimensional subspace 13 note that taking q 1 yields the fact that an n k element subset of an n element set has a unique k element subset disjoint from it hence in the q analog formula the binomial coefficient n 1 k is replaced by the gaussian bino mial coefficient n 1 k q times qk n k then the rest of the proof proceeds as usual let d q n m denote the number of dsds of v with m blocks with one block containing a designated v then we can mimic the proof of the formula s n m n 1 k 0 n 1 k s k m 1 to derive the following proposition 6 given a designated nonzero vector v v the number of dsds of v with m blocks one of which contains v is d q n m n 1 k 0 n 1 k q qk n k dq k m 1 note that taking q 1 gives the right hand side of n 1 k 0 n 1 k s k m 1 since d 1 k m 1 s k m 1 and the left hand side is the same as s n m since every set partition of an n element with m blocks has to have a block containing some designated element u since the bell numbers can be obtained from the stirling numbers of the second time as b n n m 1 s n m there is clearly a similar formula for the bell numbers b n n 1 k 0 n 1 k b k summation formula for b n this formula can also be directly proven using the designated element u reasoning so it can be similarly be extended to computing d q n the number of dsds of v with a block containing a designated nonzero vector v proposition 7 given an designated nonzero vector v v the number of dsds of v with a block containing v is d q n n 1 k 0 n 1 k q qk n k dq k in the same manner taking q 1 yields the classical summation formula for b n since d 1 k b k and every partition has to have a block containing a designated element u furthermore the d numbers have the expected relation corollary 2 d q n n m 1 d q n m note that both dq n m and d q n m are q analogs of the stirling numbers of the second kind s n m and that both dq n and d q n are q analogs of the bell numbers b n in qm sets the observables or attributes are defined by real valued functions on basis sets given a basis set u u 1 un for v zn 2 u a real valued attribute f u r determines a set partition f 1 r r f u on u and a dsd f 1 r r f u on u in full qm the important thing about an observable is not the specific numerical eigenvalues but its eigenspaces for distinct eigenvalues and that information is in the dsd of its eigenspaces the attribute f u r cannot be internalized as an operator on u zn 2 unless its values are 0 1 but it nevertheless determines the dsd f 1 r r f u which is sufficient to pedagogically model many quantum results hence a dsd can be thought of an abstract attribute without the eigenvalues with its blocks serving as eigenspaces then a natural question to ask is given any nonzero vector v v zn 2 how many abstract attributes are there where v is an eigenvector and the answer is d 2 n and d 2 n m is the number of abstract attributes with m distinct eigenvalues where v is an eigenvector 13 this was proven using mo bius inversion on the lattice of subspaces by crapo 8 29 7 4 atoms maximal dsds and segments for a finite n dimensional vector space v over gf q the partially ordered set dsd v of dsds is denoted as qn in stanley 30 example 5 5 2 b p 45 where as usual in the combinatorial theory literature the unrefinement ordering is used on partitions and dsds although there are some exceptions as in andrews 2 p 217 hence dsd v is the opposite partial order qopn of stanley s qn which reverses maximal and minimal dsds so our number of maximal dsds dq n n is stanley s number of minimal dsds m n to compute the number of atoms below a given maximal element uk k 1 n of dsd v note that there are n 1 m 1 n m 2 n 2 proper subsets of the set and each determines by direct sum a subspace of dimension 1 2 or n 1 and the proper subsets occur in complementary pairs in the atoms or binary dsds so there are 2 n 1 1 number of atoms below each maximal dsd each atom defines two projection operators and the blob 0 determines two more projection operators for a total of 2 2 n 1 1 2 2 n projection operators which gives the boolean algebra of subsets of the given n element set uk k 1 n note that once a maximal dsd is picked in dsd v and the dsds are restricted to those below i e to then that is a classical partition lattice on an n element set where 2 n 1 1 is indeed the number of atoms conversely the number of maximal elements above a given atom v 1 v 2 in dsd v will depend on the positive dimensions k dim v 1 and n k dim v 2 of the blocks v 1 and v 2 in the atom there are dq k k maximal dsds in dsd v 1 and dq n k n k maximal dsds in dsd v 2 picking one maximal dsd of each set will give a maximal dsd for the whole space that is above the given atom and a maximal dsd above the atom can be partitioned into two such subsets so we have dq k k dq n k n k k q k q 1 2 k 2 k n k q n k q 1 2 n k 2 n k k q n k q k n k q 1 2 k 2 k n k 2 n k k q n k q k n k q k 2 n k 2 number of maximal dsds above a given atom the reasoning clearly generalizes so for any given dsd wj j 1 m where dim wj nj we have m j 1 dq nj nj number of maximal dsds in dsd v refining moreover the reasoning can be generalized to arbitrary dsds above i e to the upper segment dsd v m j 1 dq dim wj number of dsds in dsd v refining as q 1 dq n b n the bell numbers and thus we get the classical formula for the number of set partitions m i 1 b ci that refine a given set partition c 1 cm 30 7 5 computing initial values for q 2 in the case of n 1 2 3 the dsds can be enumerated by hand to check the formulas and then the formulas can be used to compute higher values of d 2 n m or d 2 n since all subspaces contain the zero element which is the empty set it will be usually suppressed when listing the elements of a subspace and subsets like a or a b will be denoted as just a and ab thus the subspace a b a b is denoted for brevity as a b ab a k dimensional subspace has 2 k elements so only 2 k 1 are listed for n 1 there is only one nonzero subspace a i e a and d 2 1 1 d 2 1 1 for n 2 the whole subspace is a b ab and it has three bases a b a ab and b ab the formula for the number of bases gives d 2 2 2 3 the only d 2 2 1 1 dsd is the whole space for n 3 the whole space a b c ab ac bc abc is the only d 2 3 1 1 and indeed for any n and q dq n 1 1 for n 3 and m 3 d 2 3 3 is the number of maximal dsds of dsd z 3 2 which is the number unordered bases of z 32 recall n n q 1 for all q since we know the signature i e a 1 3 and otherwise ak 0 we can easily compute d 2 3 3 1 a 1 a 2 an n q 1 q a 1 n q an q 1 2 n 2 k akk 2 1 3 3 2

dimensional subspaces has qk n k subspaces disjoint from it for n 3 and k 1 each row gives the 22 4 subspaces disjoint from any given 1 dimensional subspace represented by a b abc for instance the four subspaces disjoint from the subspace ab shorthand for a b are given in the third row since those are the complementary subspaces that together with ab form a dsd 31 to illustrate the number of atoms below a maximal element recall that a maximal dsd and a basis set are the same thing for q 2 the basis set a ac bc for z 32 has 22 1 3 atoms below it namely a ab ac bc bc a c ac and ac a bc abc and those three atoms determine the eight element ba a ac bc of subsets of the basis set to illustrate the number of maximal dsds above a given atom for q 2 where maximal dsd basis set and n 3 each atom has k 1 and n k 2 so the formula gives 3 which is correct for instance the atom ac a bc abc has three maximal dsds above it namely a ac bc a ac abc and ac bc abc note that for q 1 the formula
