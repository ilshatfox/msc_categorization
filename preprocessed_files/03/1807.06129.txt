concepts related to internal approachability we prove that an implication of fuchino usuba relating stationary reflection to a version of strong chang s conjecture cannot be reversed strengthen and simplify some results of krueger about forcing axioms and approachability and prove that some other related results of krueger are sharp we also adapt some ideas of woodin to simplify and unify many arguments in the literature involving preservation of forcing axioms 1 introduction foreman todorcevic 13 introduced several natural variants of the class ia of internally approach able sets of size 1 these are the classes of internally club sets ic the internally stationary sets is and the internally unbounded sets iu the inclusions 1 ia ic is iu follow from zfc and if the continuum hypothesis holds then ia ic is iu 1 the chain of inclusions in 1 is closely related to shelah s approachability ideal i 2 as follows lemma 1 folklore see remarks after observation 22 for a proof assume 2 1 2 the asser tion that the approachability property fails at 2 i e that 2 i 2 is equivalent to the assertion that iu ia is stationary in 2 h 2 in other words failure of approachability property at 2 is equivalent to asserting that at least one of the three inclusions in 1 is strict in p 2 h 2 ns in light of lemma 1 a separation of adjacent classes in the chain of inclusions from 1 can be viewed as a very strong failure of approachability foreman and todorcevic independently proved that the proper forcing axiom pfa implies failure of the approachability property at 2 2 in particular pfa implies that at least one of the inclusions in 1 must be strict krueger 21 improved this by showing that pfa in fact separates ia from ic in a global fashion given subclasses and of w w 1 w such that let us say that the inclusion is globally strict iff 2 h 2 h is stationary for every regular 2 answering a question of foreman todorcevic krueger proved 21 20 and 22 that each of the three inclusions in 1 can be globally strict under various strong forcing axioms as mentioned above pfa globally separates ia from ic but stronger forcing axioms were used for the following separations 2010 mathematics subject classification 03 e 55 03 e 35 the author gratefully acknowledges support from simons foundation grant 318467 1 meaning that for any regular 2 for all but nonstationarily many w h 1 w is in one of those four classes if and only if it is in all of them 2 see the discussion preceding theorem 5 3 in ko nig yoshinobu 19 1 http arxiv org abs 1807 06129 v 3 2 sean d cox theorem 2 krueger 22 theorem 5 2 pfa implies that the inclusion ic iu i e between the second and fourth class in the chain 1 is globally strict in particular pfa implies there is a disjoint stationary sequence on 2 theorem 3 krueger corollary of theorem 0 2 of 20 and theorem 6 3 of 22 martin s maxi mum mm implies that the inclusion is iu is globally strict in particular there is a disjoint club sequence on 2 theorem 4 krueger 20 theorem 0 3 pfa 2 implies that the inclusion ic is is globally strict we prove that the assumptions of his theorems 2 and 3 are sharp but the assumption of theorem 4 is not theorem 5 the assumption of pfa in theorem 2 cannot be replaced by pfa theorem 6 the assumption of mm in theorem 3 cannot be replaced by pfa 1 theorem 7 the conclusion of theorem 4 also follows from pfa and from martin s maximum 3 but not from pfa note that the pfa portion of theorem 7 i e that pfa implies that the inclusion ic is is globally strict strengthens both theorems 2 and 4 figure 1 summarizes the theorems above figure 1 when the inclusions from 1 are globally strict ia ic is iu strict under pfa strict under pfa mm not pfa strict under mm not pfa 1 foreman and todorcevic also considered stationary reflection principles for the classes in 1 given a possibly finite cardinal 1 and a subclass of w w 1 w let rp assert that for all regular 2 and every sized collection s of stationary subsets of h there is a w such that s w is stationary in w for every s s we usually write rp for rp 1 now 1 clearly implies 2 rpia rpic rpis rpiu krueger answering another question of foreman todorcevic 13 proved that the implication rpic rpis cannot be reversed in fact theorem 8 krueger 20 rp 1 is does not imply rpic 4 fuchino usuba 15 proved another result related to 2 they introduced a game theoretic princi ple denoted g proved it is equivalent to a version of strong chang s conjecture see definition 25 below and also equivalent to a reflection principle that they did not name but which we call rpinternal see section 2 they proved 3 separation of ic from is under martin s maximum was claimed in theorem 4 4 part 3 of viale 32 but the argument given there implicitly used the stronger assumption mm 2 see section 5 3 for a discussion 4 the theorem stated in theorem 5 1 of 20 just says that rp 1 is does not imply rpia but the proof there clearly shows that even rpic fails in his model forcing axioms approachability and stationary set reflection 3 theorem 9 fuchino usuba 15 rpic rpinternal g rpis we show below that the left implication of theorem 9 cannot be reversed this was already implicit in krueger s model from theorem 8 but our theorem 11 below strengthens and simplifies his result in several ways in particular the model of theorem 11 1 satisfies pfa and a plus version of a fragment of pfa 2 can be forced over an arbitrary model of pfa 1 in a single step and 3 satisfies diagonal internal reflection to guessing internally stationary sets drpinternal gis which is a highly simultaneous form of internal stationary reflection to the so called guessing sets used by viale weiss 33 to characterize the principle isp see section 2 in what follows gic refers to the class of guessing internally club sets and gis refers to the class of guessing internally stationary sets we also introduce some fragments of standard forcing axioms pfa 1 hv 2 ic denotes the forcing axiom fa 1 where is the class of proper posets that force hv 2 ic pfa 1 hv 2 ia is defined similarly see section 2 3 for the meaning of fa 1 mm 1 hv 2 is denotes the forcing axiom fa 1 where is the class of posets that preserve stationary subsets of 1 and force h v 2 is theorem 10 pfa 1 hv 2 ic implies drpinternal gis see section 2 a highly simultaneous version of internal stationary reflection to gis sets in particular this implies rp 1 is theorem 11 there is a 2 strategically closed poset that preserves pfa 1 hv 2 ic and forces rpic moreover if pfa held in the ground model then pfa is also preserved corollary 12 drpinternal gis does not imply rpic in particular the implication rpic rpinternal from theorem 9 cannot be reversed we also prove the following similar theorems theorem 13 pfa 1 hv 2 ia implies drpgic which is equivalent to drpinternal gic see observa tion 23 theorem 14 there is a 2 strategically closed poset that preserves pfa 1 hv 2 ia and forces rpia moreover if pfa held in the ground model then pfa is also preserved corollary 15 drpgic does not imply rpia in particular the implication rpia rpic from 2 cannot be reversed figure 2 summarizes the implications and non implications it shows that for the classes ia ic and is the maximal form of simultaneous reflection i e drp for one class does not even imply rp 1 for the next nicer class this contrasts greatly with the foreman todorcevic result corollary 20 of 13 that rp 3 2 v implies rp 1 unif 1 where 2 v w w 1 w and unif 1 w v cf sup w 1 for every regular uncountable w we now address the implication rpis rpiu from 2 whether this is reversible is closely related to question 5 12 of krueger 20 and to the question of whether the implica tion rpinternal rpis from theorem 9 can be reversed we do not know the answer to any of those questions but the following are some partial results that may shed light on this surprisingly difficult problem 4 sean d cox figure 2 an arrow indicates an implication and an arrow with an x indicates a non implication in order to simplify the figure the non implications shown do not incorporate the full strength of the theorems above drpia drpic x s s s s yyss s s drpinternal x xx drpis rpia rpic rpinternal rpis in light of the way that we separated the various reflection principles above theorem 10 through corollary 15 it is natural to conjecture that mm 1 hv 2 is should imply drpiu and that mm 1 hv 2 is should be preserved by a forcing that kills rpis this would have separated rpis from rpiu in a manner similar to the earlier separation results however mm 1 hv 2 is does not imply drpiu and in fact does not even imply the weakest generalized reflection principle of all as the next theorem shows the notation wrp is conventionally used to denote rp where is the entire class w w 1 w theorem 16 mm 1 hv 2 is is consistent with failure of wrp 2 recall that mm 1 hv 2 is is the 1 version of the forcing axiom for the class of posets that preserve stationary subsets of 1 and force h v 2 is a familiar poset in this class is namba forcing martin s maximum implies that namba forcing is semiproper which in turn implies wrp 2 5 also by sakai 26 wrp 2 is equivalent to the semi stationary reflection principle for 2 denoted ssr 2 the following corollary of theorem 16 may be of independent interest corollary 17 the axiom fa 1 namba forcing does not imply ssr 2 although mm 1 hv 2 is does not imply even wrp 2 it does imply a diagonal kind of ordinal reflection the principle drp cof giu is a weakening of drpgiu where one only asks for diagonal reflection of stationary subsets of cof rather than stationary subsets of we prove theorem 18 mm 1 hv 2 is implies drp cof giu corollary 19 drp cof giu does not imply wrp 2 to aid in the proofs of most of the theorems above we adapt some ideas of woodin to prove a very general theorem theorem 20 about preservation of forcing axioms theorem 20 makes such preservation arguments more closely resemble arguments about lifting large cardinal embeddings theorem 20 consolidates a variety of results in the literature about forcing axiom preservation into a single framework see examples in section 4 and may be of use in other applications theorem 20 forcing axiom preservation theorem assume is a class of posets that is closed under restrictions see definition 39 p is a partial order and is a p name for a definable class of posets that is also closed under restrictions assume 1 is a cardinal possibly 0 and that fa holds assume also that for every p name for a poset q and every p q name s i i for a sequence of many stationary subsets of 1 there exists a p q name r possibly depending on q and s such that 5 by shelah 27 and todorcevic 29 forcing axioms approachability and stationary set reflection 5 1 p q r 2 p q forces that r preserves the stationarity of s i for every i 3 if j v n is a generic elementary embedding p q r is regular in v and a hv is in the wellfounded part of n which we assume has been transitivized b j hv n and has size 1 in n c crit j v 2 and d there exists a g h k in n such that i g h k is hv p q r generic ii n s i g h is stationary for all i then n believes that j g has a lower bound in j p then v p fa the theorem above is stated in a general form to accommodate both the plus versions of forcing axioms and situations where one only wants to preserve a fragment of a forcing axiom e g if is the class of proper forcings but names the class of totally proper posets in v p in many situations however one wants for p to just preserve say pfa in this situation the from theorem 20 is zero and theorem 20 tells us that it suffices to show that for every p name q for a proper poset there exists a p q name r possibly depending on q such that 1 p q r is proper 2 if j v n is a generic elementary embedding p q r is regular in v and a hv is in the wellfounded part of n b j hv n and has size 1 in n c crit j v 2 and d there exists a g h k in n that is hv p q r generic then n believes that j g has a lower bound in j p in addition to using theorem 20 to prove our own results section 4 1 provides several examples from the literature that can be viewed as instances of theorem 20 section 2 provides the relevant background section 3 provides some key theorems for precisely controlling the internal part of an elementary submodel of size 1 while also ensuring that the elementary submodel will be a guessing set these arguments frequently make use of todorcevic s collapse poset of finite conditions e g as in 28 modified by a device introduced by nee man 25 to ensure continuity of the generic chain section 4 proves the forcing axiom preservation theorem mentioned above section 5 proves theorems 5 6 and 7 section 6 proves the remaining theorems from the introduction about rp and the forcing axioms pfa 1 hv 2 ic etc section 7 includes some questions and closing remarks 6 sean d cox 2 preliminaries unless otherwise noted all notation and terminology comes from jech 18 for m n snm denotes the set of n such that cf m 2 1 classes of 1 sized sets we will use 2 v to denote the class w w 1 w the star superscript indicates that we are not including chang like structures i e 2 v does not include w of size 1 such that w 1 foreman todorcevic 13 defined several weakenings of internal approachability e g they called a w 2 v internally stationary iff w w is stationary in w for the proofs in this article it will be convenient to use the following equivalent definitions if w 2 v a filtration of w is any increasing and continuous sequence n ni i 1 of countable sets such that w i 1 ni it is easy to see that if n and m are both filtrations of w then ni mi for all but nonstationarily many i 1 the internal part of w denoted int w is the equivalence class i 1 ni w in the boolean algebra 1 ns 1 where n is any filtration of w since any two filtrations of w agree on a club subset of 1 the choice of the filtration does not matter we will often abuse terminology and refer to a subset t 1 as the internal part of w when really we mean that the equivalence class of t modulo ns 1 is the internal part of w similarly when we say the internal part of w contains t we mean t int w in the boolean algebra 1 ns 1 the external part of w is defined to be 1 int w if w 2 v w is called internally approachable if there exists a filtration n ni i 1 of w such that n i w for every i 1 internally club if int w contains a club subset of 1 and internally stationary if int w is a stationary subset of 1 we use ia ic and is to denote the class of internally approachable internally club and internally stationary sets respectively we will also sometimes refer to the class iu of internally unbounded sets which is the class of w 2 v such that w w is cofinal in w 6 lemma 21 suppose w 2 v has internal part t and external part t c we make no assump tions about stationarity or costationarity of t here then this remains true in any outer model where 1 is not collapsed proof fix any filtration n ni i 1 of w then by definition of internal and external parts there is a club c 1 such that t c i 1 ni w and t c c i 1 ni w if v is an outer model of v with the same 1 then c is of course still club in v so t t c and t c t c c in the 1 ns 1 of v so the above two containments witness that v believes t is the internal part and t c is the external part of w we also observe 6 w iu can also be characterized by saying that there exists a filtration n of w such that ni w for unboundedly many i 1 if w iu is the set of such i is nonstationary in 1 for any filtration and even empty for some filtrations of w and hence int w in the boolean algebra 1 ns 1 however the assertion int w does not characterize w iu is even among those w of uniform cofinality 1 because there are always stationarily many w 2 h 1 that have uniform cofinality 1 yet are not internally unbounded this is due to zapletal see foreman magidor 11 forcing axioms approachability and stationary set reflection 7 observation 22 if m is a transitive zf model of size 1 with internal part t and m 2 m ord is regular in m then the internal part of h m contains t proof let q qi i 1 be a filtration of m and let c be club in 1 such that qi m for every i t c then qi h m i 1 is a filtration of h m and if i t c then qi m and hence qi h m m although we will not use it in this paper we provide a brief sketch of the proof of the folklore lemma 1 from the introduction similar arguments are implicit in work of shelah and somewhat more explicit in foreman magidor 10 by the assumption 2 1 2 we can fix a bijection 2 h 2 it is routine to check that 3 iu 2 h 2 s 21 where the means equal mod ns in 2 h 2 assume first that 2 i 2 this implies see foreman 9 that for a sufficiently large regular there is a first order structure a h in a countable language and an 1 club d s 2 1 such that for every d sk a 2 and there exists a strictly increasing sequence i i 1 that is cofinal in and every proper initial segment of is an element of w sk a we can without loss of generality assume that a includes a predicate for and hence for w h 2 for every d by 3 together with the assumption that d is almost all of s 21 to show that ia iu it will suffice to show that w h 2 ia for every d and for any d i j j i i 1 can easily be shown to be a filtration of w h 2 witnessing its internal approachability the other direction of lemma 1 is easier we leave this to the reader 2 2 stationary reflection principles given a regular cardinal 2 a subclass of 2 v and a possibly finite cardinal 1 rp is the assertion that for every sized collection s of stationary subsets of h there is a w such that s w is stationary for every s s the principle rp internal which was isolated but not named in fuchino usuba 15 asserts that for every sized collection s of stationary subsets of h there is a w such that s w w not just s w is stationary for every s s if is not specified in the subscript of rp it is understood to be 2 v we also typically write rp instead of rp 1 rp means that rp holds for every regular 2 similar notational shortcuts apply to all the reflection principles we mention notice that observation 23 rpic is equivalent to rpinternal ic since if w ic and s w is stationary then s w w is stationary as well we now recall the diagonal versions of stationary reflection as introduced in 5 drp asserts that there are stationarily many w 2 h 2 such that w h and s w h is stationary in w h whenever s w and s is stationary in h we also define a diagonal version of fuchino usuba s internal reflection drpinternal is defined the same way as drp except we require that s w w h not just s w h is stationary for every s w that is stationary in h remark 24 the principle drp easily implies rp 1 and in cox 5 it was asked if they are equivalent the author subsequently noticed that larson 23 gives a model where rp 1 holds but drp fails so drp is strictly stronger than rp 1 8 sean d cox we also define a weaker kind of diagonal reflection if is a subclass of 2 v drp cof asserts that for every regular 2 there are stationarily many w 2 h 2 such that for every r w that is a stationary subset of cof r sup w is stationary in sup w this is a consequence of weak drp wdrp introduced in 5 whether these two principles are equivalent is not known we now mention a few facts that although we will not use them in this paper illustrate that the notion of internal stationary reflection and its diagonal version are quite natural and related to several other well studied topics the following version of strong chang s conjecture was isolated but not named in fuchino usuba 15 it is a stronger version of the principle scccofgap considered in cox 3 definition 25 global scccof gap is the following assertion for all sufficiently large regular and all wellorders on h and every countable m h there are cofinally many w h 1 such that 1 1 w 2 letting m w denote sk h m w we have m w w m we note that the version of strong chang s conjecture isolated by doebler schindler 7 has a similar characterization where the m w w m requirement from definition 25 is weakened to the requirement that m w w m equivalently that m w 1 m 1 doebler schindler s version is equivalent to the principle which in turn is equivalent to semistationary set reflection see 7 the relevance of global scccofgap to the current paper is the following theorem theorem 26 fuchino usuba 7 rpinternal is equivalent to global scc cof gap the following lemma characterizes internal diagonal reflection it is a situation one often encoun ters when generically lifting a large cardinal embedding j v m to domain v p when j p is proper in m but not necessarily in v lemma 27 let be a subclass of 2 v the following are equivalent 1 drpinternal 2 for every regular 2 there are stationarily many w 2 h 2 such that a w h and b hw is correct about stationary subsets of 1 w where w hw w h 2 is the inverse of the mostowski collapse of w 3 for every regular 2 there is a generic elementary embedding j v n such that a hv 2 is in the wellfounded part of n b j hv 2 n c n j hv is a member of j d crit j v 2 forcing axioms approachability and stationary set reflection 9 e n hv 2 is correct about stationary subsets of the equivalence of 1 with 2 is almost identical to the proof of theorem 3 6 of cox 5 and the equivalence of 2 with 3 is a generic ultrapower argument closely resembling the proof of theorem 8 of cox 4 we refer the reader to those sources 7 2 3 forcing axioms and partially generic filters given a class of partial orders and a possibly finite cardinal 1 fa is the assertion whenever p d is an 1 sized collection of dense subsets of p and s i i is a length list of p names for stationary subsets of 1 then there is a filter g p such that g d 6 for every d d and for every i the following set is stationary in 1 s i g 1 p g p s i in the literature fa 1 is often denoted fa but we do not use that convention since we will need to deal both with the case 2 and the case 1 fa is as defined above but without mentioning the names for stationary sets so fa is the same as fa 0 if q is a poset and q w h we say that g is a w q generic filter iff g is a filter on w q and g d w 6 for every d w that is dense in q if 1 and s s i i is a sequence of q names for stationary subsets of 1 such that s w we say that g is an s correct w q generic filter if g is a w q generic filter as defined above and for every i s i g 1 q g q s i is in v a stationary subset of 1 let w hw w h be the inverse of the mostowski collapse ofw and suppose g w q it is easy to see that g is w q generic if and only if 1 w g is an hw 1 q generic filter in the usual sense furthermore if w s w and g is a w q generic filter then s i w for every i and g is s correct iff for every i the evaluation of 1 w s i by 1 w g is in v a stationary subset of 1 2 4 guessing models and strongly proper club shooting a pair of transitive zf models m n has the 1 approximation property iff for every x m and every a x n if a z m for every z m such that m z is countable then a m we say that m n has the 1 covering property iff for every z n that is countable in n there is a z m that is countable in m such that z z a poset p has the 1 approximation property iff it forces that v v p has the 1 approximation property and has the 1 covering property iff it forces that v v p has the 1 covering property the following fact is often used fact 28 viale weiss 33 if p has the 1 approximation and covering properties and p q has the 1 approximation and covering properties then p q has the 1 approximation and covering properties a set w is called an 1 guessing model if w 2 v w w w zf and hw v has the 1 approximation property where hw is the transitive collapse of w 8 we will often just say guessing model instead of 1 guessing model and use either g or when there is risk of confusion g 1 to denote the class of guessing models viale weiss 33 proved that weiss 7 those two cited proofs deal with the particular class ic but go through for internal reflection the key use of the class ic in those proofs was the above observation 23 8 this is equivalent to the original definition of guessing model from viale weiss 33 10 sean d cox generalized tree property principle isp 2 is equivalent to the assertion that for every regular 2 the set of guessing models is stationary in 2 h we say that w is an indestructible guessing model in v if letting w be the least regular cardinal such that w h v w then w remains a guessing model in any zf model n n such that h v w is an element of the wellfounded part of n and v 1 n 1 here n may be external to v and we even allow that v can be a set from n s point of view this of course isn t a first order statement over v but in typical contexts there are first order substitutes for this notion e g the presence of specializing functions in hv that guarantee such indestructibility see proposition 4 4 of 6 we let giu denote the possibly empty class of guessing models that are also internally unbounded theorem 29 viale weiss 33 see also proposition 4 4 of 6 assume 2 is regular and p is a poset that forces hv giu 9 then there is a p name s hv for a c c c poset such that p s hv forces h v to be indestructibly guessing corollary 30 suppose w h 2 w 2 v and p w is a poset forcing hv giu let s hv be as in the conclusion of theorem 29 if there exists a w p s hv generic filter then w h is indestructibly guessing proof suppose g h is such a w generic filter let w hw be the transitive collapse of w w and g h g h clearly g h is generic over hw then by theorem 29 hw g h h hw is indestructibly guessing this statement is upward absolute to v since v is an outer model of hw g h with the same 1 finally notice that h hw w h so the transitive collapse of w h is indestructibly guessing which implies that w h is indestructibly guessing given a partial order p a regular p and a condition p p we say that p is an m p strong master condition iff there is a condition p m m p such that for every r m that is stronger than p m r is compatible in p with p the condition p m is not typically unique and is called a reduction of p into m a partial order p is strongly proper on a stationary set iff there is a stationary s h p such that for all but nonstationarily many m s and every p m there is a p p such that p is an m p strong master condition this concept was isolated by mitchell and its main use is fact 31 mitchell 24 if p is strongly proper on a stationary set then it has the 1 covering and approximation properties there are two kinds of posets that are strongly proper on a stationary set that we will use in this paper adding a cohen real and the following club shooting poset which is the continuous version of todorcevic s collapse this poset is a special case of neeman s decorated poset from 25 the role of the f in definition 32 is just to ensure that the chain of elementary submodels added by the first coordinate is continuous 10 definition 32 let 2 be regular and x a stationary subset of h which we will without loss of generality assume consists only of elementary submodels of h the poset c fin dec x is the collection of all pairs of the form m f where 9 a sufficient condition for this is if p collapses hv to size 1 and has the 1 covering and approximation properties 10 neeman s forcing is designed to preserve 1 and we do not need preservation of for our purposes forcing axioms approachability and stationary set reflection 11 m is a finite subset of x and for every m n m with m 6 n either m n or n m we let m 0 m 1 m 2 mk be the unique enumeration of m such that mi mi 1 for every i k f is a function from m h and has the property that f mi mi 1 for every i k the ordering is defined by n h m f iff n m and h m f m for every m m fact 33 similar to neeman 25 section 4 suppose x is a stationary subset of h where 2 is regular then 1 c fin dec x is strongly proper on a stationary set in particular if n h 2 is countable n h x and m f is a condition in n then m n h f is an n c fin dec x strong master condition 2 if g is generic over v for c fin dec x then g is an increasing filtration of hv of length 1 consisting entirely of members of x moreover if x 0 v was a stationary subset of x and qi i 1 v g is the generic filtration then there are stationarily many i 1 such that qi x 0 in particular c fin dec x has the 1 covering and approximation properties and forces h v 1 we will also need lemma 34 if p is proper and is a regular uncountable cardinal then p c fin dec v is proper proof fix a regular with p h let n h p be countable and p m f n be a condition in the two step iteration since p is proper there is a p p that is an n p master condition so in particular p forces n g p n v then by fact 33 p forces that m n f is an n g p c fin dec v strong master condition then p m n f is a master condition for n that is stronger than p m f 2 5 a theorem of gitik and velickovic for any set r and any t 1 r t z r z 1 t a set r h is called projective stationary iff r t is stationary for every stationary t 1 this concept was isolated in feng jech 8 we make heavy use of the following theorem of velickovic which slightly improved an earlier theorem of gitik 16 theorem 35 velickovic 30 lemma 3 15 suppose v w are transitive zfc models rv 6 rw and that is a w regular cardinal with w 2 then in w for every stationary r cof and every stationary t 1 there are stationarily many z v such that z 1 t and sup z r in particular v is projective stationary the statement of theorem 35 is slightly stronger than the version in 30 which didn t mention the set r just the projective stationarity of v but a close examination of velickovic s proof shows the statement above because he proved that in w given any stationary t 1 and any function f for all but nonstationarily many members of the set x h 2 x cof there is a z x such that z is closed under f sup z x z v and z 1 t this will be the case for any x in the displayed set that has as an element player ii s winning strategy in the game from page 272 of 30 in particular this is true for some x such that x r we also will use 12 sean d cox lemma 36 suppose is an uncountable ordinal s is a stationary subset of is a regular uncountable cardinal strictly larger than and r is a stationary subset of cof then u sup u r and u s is stationary in proof let a be any first order structure on in a countable language we need to find a countable elementary substructure of a whose supremum is in r and whose intersection with is in s fix an m a of size such that m and m r this is possible because and r is a stationary subset of cof fix a skolemized structure b with universe m in a countable language extending a m such that any elementary substructure of b is cofinal in m this is possible because m is cofinal since s is stationary in and m fodor s lemma implies that there is a z s such that z z where z is the b skolem hull of z then z is elementary in b and hence sup z m r since z b b extends a m and m a then z a and z z s 3 controlling the internal part of a guessing model in this section we prove some facts that will be used in most of the proofs of the paper the tight control over the internal and external parts is mainly needed for theorem 7 a poset is called 1 ssp if it preserves all stationary subsets of 1 given uncountable sets h h and a subset s h lifth s denotes the set z h z h s it is a standard fact that if s is stationary then so is its lifting theorem 37 fix a possibly nonstationary subset t of 1 and a regular 2 1 there is an 1 ssp poset q 1 ssp t that forces the following for every v regular cardinal v 2 h v has size 1 is indestructibly guessing internally unbounded and its internal part is exactly mod ns 1 the set t also every stationary subset of cof from the ground model remains stationary in the extension 2 there is a proper poset q proper t that forces the following for every v regular cardinal v 2 h v has size 1 is indestructibly guessing and its internal part contains t more over if t was costationary in v then both the internal and external parts of hv are forced to have stationary intersection with t c in particular if t was stationary and costationary then q proper t forces int h v contains the stationary set t and ext hv is a stationary subset of t c for every v regular v 2 proof for part 1 q 1 ssp t is defined to be the poset 4 add c findec x t s h v forcing axioms approachability and stationary set reflection 13 where letting be the add name for its generic object x t lift hv hv t v 2 t c v z h z hv v and z 1 t or z 2 v and z 1 t c c findec x t is the poset from definition 32 and s h v is the poset given by theorem 29 assuming that the assumptions of that theorem hold which we verify first for theorem 29 to be applicable we need to check that the first two steps of 4 force hv iu this is part of the following claim claim 37 1 the first two steps of the poset 4 force that a hv g 1 iu b all v stationary subsets of cof remain stationary c all v stationary subsets of 1 remain stationary and d for all v 2 that are regular in v h v has internal part exactly t proof of claim 37 1 the proofs of parts a and b break into cases depending on whether or not t is stationary in v though the proofs of these parts could be combined we find it conceptually simpler to prove each part separately at the expense of some slight repetition for part a the poset add is strongly proper and the 2 nd step is forced to be strongly proper on a stationary set by fact 33 provided that the set x t is forced by add to be a stationary subset of h we verify this now let be add generic we break into cases depending on whether t is stationary in v if t is stationary in v then h t is stationary so properness of add implies that the set hv t v remains stationary in v and hence its lifting to hv which is a subset of x t is sta tionary from the point of view of v on the other hand if t is nonstationary in v then t c contains a club subset of 1 by gitik velickovic s theorem 35 noting that v 2 v 2 the set 2 v is projective stationary in v so in particular 2 t c v is stationary and hence its lifting to hv is stationary and this lifting is a subset of x t in summary whether t is stationary or not the set x t is forced by add to be stationary and hence the first two steps of 4 are of the form strongly proper followed by strongly proper on a stationary set so this 2 step iteration has the 1 approximation and cover properties by facts 31 and 28 this in turn ensures that hv will be 1 guessing and internally unbounded after the first two steps of the iteration 4 for all v regular 2 this completes the proof of part a of the claim next we verify part b of the claim let r be a stationary subset of cof from the ground model consider two cases depending on whether or not t is stationary in v if t is stationary in v then v r vt z h v sup z r and z 1 t is stationary in by properness of add r vt remains stationary in v and the lifting of r v t to h is a stationary subset of x t by fact 33 the second step of the forcing 4 preserves the stationarity of r vt since the supremum of every element of r v t lies in r it follows that r is still stationary as well 14 sean d cox now suppose t is nonstationary in v by fact 33 and the definition of x t it suffices to prove that v z sup z r z 2 v and z 1 t c is stationary in now v 2 v 2 and t c contains a club subset of 1 by our case so in turn it suffices to show that 5 v z sup z r and z 2 2 v is stationary in since v 2 v 2 theorem 35 implies that 2 v is stationary in v where the from the statement of that theorem is taken to be 2 by properness of add r is still a stationary subset of cof in v if 2 then 5 follows from theorem 35 directly if 2 then 5 follows from theorem 35 again with 2 together with lemma 36 next we verify part c of the claim let s be a stationary subset of 1 and let be v add generic then at least one of s t or s t c is stationary suppose first that s t is stationary then hv v s t is stationary in v and remains so in v by properness of add then its lifting to hv is a stationary subset of of x t x t so by fact 33 viewing v as the ground model cfindec x t preserves the stationarity of lift hv hv v s t and in particular the stationarity of s t now suppose s t c is stationary then it is still stationary in v so by gitik velickovic s theorem 35 2 s t c v is stationary and hence its lifting to hv is stationary moreover this lifting is a subset of x t then by fact 33 again viewing v as the ground model the poset cfindec x t preserves stationarity of lift 2 s t c v and hence stationarity of s t c finally we verify part d of the claim the poset c x t adds a filtration qi i 1 of h v with the property that whenever i is in the club c i 1 qi 1 i then if i t then qi h v v which implies that qi h v v for all 2 and if i t c then qi 2 v which implies that qi h v v for all 2 it follows that for each v regular 2 the filtration qi h v i 1 has the property that for every i c qi h v is an element of h v if and only if i t this shows that the internal part of hv is forced to be exactly t then by claim 37 1 and theorem 29 the third step s hv of the poset 4 forces h v to be indestructibly guessing and still internally unbounded also claim 37 1 and lemma 21 imply that for every v regular v 2 h v still has internal part exactly t after forcing with s h v since the latter preserves 1 it is c c c since s h v is forced to be c c c in particular it preserves all stationary subsets of 1 and of cof that lie in v add c fin dec x t together with claim 37 1 it follows that all stationary subsets of cof and of 1 from v are preserved by the 3 step iteration 4 this completes the proof of part 1 of the theorem part 2 is similar q proper t is defined similarly to the poset q 1 ssp t defined in 4 except that instead of the add name x t we use the add name y t lift hv hv v 2 t c v z h z hv v or z 1 t c and z 2 v forcing axioms approachability and stationary set reflection 15 the proof is similar to the proof of part 1 so we only briefly sketch it roughly the fact that y t contains the lifting of all of hv v rather than just of hv v t as was the case with the club shooting portion of q 1 ssp t ensures that the iteration q proper t will indeed be proper now suppose is v add generic and y t y t let qi i 1 be a generic filtration of hv added by c fin dec y t over v by definition of y t if i is such that qi 1 i and i t then qi h v v and hence qi h v v for every v regular v 2 it follows that the internal part of any such hv contains mod ns 1 the set t in particular if t is stationary then hv is v q now for the moreover clause of part 2 assume that t is costationary we want to show that both the internal and external part of each hv have stationary intersection with t c that the internal part of each hv has stationary intersection with t c follows from fact 33 together with the fact that hv v t c is in v a stationary subset of y t more precisely its lifting to h is a stationary subset of y t for the external part the gitik velickovic theorem 35 ensures that in v the lifting of 2 t c v is a stationary subset of y t and hence by fact 33 there are stationarily many i 1 such that qi 1 i t c and qi v 2 v for such i qi h v h v for every v regular v 2 the proof that hv is forced by q proper t to be indestructibly guessing is almost identical to the proof from part 1 corollary 38 assume 2 is regular and t 1 let q proper t and q 1 ssp t be the posets given by theorem 37 1 assume w h 2 t w 1 w and there exists a w q 1 ssp t generic filter then for every regular 2 w w h is indestructibly guessing has internal part exactly t and external part exactly t c in particular if t is nonstationary then w h giu is and if t is stationary and costationary then w h gis ic if the w q 1 ssp t generic filter is also stationary correct with respect to names for sta tionary subsets of 1 that lie in w then for every r w that is a stationary subset of cof r sup w is stationary in sup w 2 let s 2 external be the q proper t name for the external part of h v 2 if t is costationary then s 2 external is forced to be a stationary subset of t c furthermore if w h 2 t w 1 w and there exists a w q proper t generic filter that interprets s 2 external as a stationary set then for every regular 2 w w h is indestructibly guessing its internal part contains t and its external part is stationary and costationary in t c in particular if t is stationary and costationary then w h g 1 is ic for every regular 2 w proof for part 2 the fact that s 2 external is forced to be stationary follows immediately from the orem 37 also observation 22 implies that 6 reg 2 ext h v ext h v 2 s 2 external now suppose w is as in the statement of part 2 and that g is a w q proper t generic filter such that s 2 external g is a stationary subset of 1 in v let w hw w h 2 t be the inverse of the transitive collapse of w and bw 1 w b for every b w let g be the pointwise image of g under the collapsing map note that t w and t is not moved by the collapsing map it can also be easily verified that s 2 external g is the same as 1 w s 2 external g let s denote this set fix any regular w 2 then by 6 and theorem 37 hw g 1 h 16 sean d cox is indestructibly guessing size 1 its internal part contains 1 t t and its external part contains s since hw g is a transitive zf model and v is an outer model of hw g with the same 1 those statements are upward absolute to v finally notice that the statement x is indestructibly guessing its internal part contains t and its external part contains s viewing t and s as fixed parameters is invariant across sets that are isomorphic to x in particular v believes the same statement about w 1 w h which is just w h this completes the proof of part 2 the proof of 1 is similar using instead part 1 of theorem 37 the only new thing to check is that if the w generic filter g is stationary correct then w is diagonally reflecting for stationary subsets of cof lying in w to see this note that is collapsed to 1 and still has uncountable cofinality let f be a q 1 ssp t name for a strictly increasing continuous cofinal function from 1 suppose r w and r is stationary in cof let t r be the name for i 1 f i r since r remains stationary by theorem 37 it follows that t r is forced to be a stationary subset of 1 and hence its interpretation by g is really stationary in 1 by viale weiss 33 w is an closed set of ordinals this together with w genericity of g implies that f g maps 1 continuously and cofinally into sup w then the pointwise image of t r g under f g is a stationary subset of sup w and also contained in r 4 preservation of forcing axioms via generic embeddings the material in this section is motivated by woodin 34 and viale 32 31 where stationary tower forcing is used in conjunction with forcing axioms unlike those settings which made use of large cardinals in the universe to ensure wellfounded generic ultrapowers via stationary tower forcing wellfoundedness will not be important for the goals of this article the main theorem in this section theorem 20 makes preservation arguments for forcing axioms very closely resemble arguments that involve lifting traditional large cardinal embeddings this makes forcing axiom preservation arguments conceptually clearer in the author s opinion theorem 20 is possibly folklore but the author is not aware of any presentation of it in the literature the section concludes with several preservation results from the literature which can be viewed as instances of theorem 20 we make the following definition which holds of all standard classes of posets proper c c c etc definition 39 we say that a class of posets is closed under restrictions iff whenever q and q q then q q p q p q with order inherited from q is in note that in the statement of theorem 20 we do not require that or is closed under taking regular suborders this will be convenient in the proof of the theorems about stationary reflection since e g being proper and and forcing hv 2 ic is not closed under regular suborders the regular suborder will be proper but may fail to force hv 2 ic however notice that if fa holds and is the closure of under taking regular suborders then fa also holds this is not necessarily true of the plus versions unless one also requires that the quotient of the regular suborder is 1 ssp we will use the following observation several times observation 40 if fa holds and p is a regular suborder of some member of but possibly p then p preserves stationary subsets of 1 this is because by foreman magidor shelah 12 every member of must be 1 ssp and this property clearly is inherited by regular suborders forcing axioms approachability and stationary set reflection 17 the key to the preservation theorem is the following lemma of woodin lemma 41 woodin 34 proof of theorem 2 53 if is a class of partial orders and 1 is a cardinal possibly 0 the following are equivalent 1 fa 2 for every p every sequence s s i i of p names for stationary subsets of 1 and every equivalently some regular p there are stationarily many w 2 h such that there exists an s correct w p generic filter remark 42 suppose 1 and has the additional property that for every p and every cardinal there exists a p name q such that p q and p q 1 this holds for example if is the class of proper posets or 1 ssp posets but not c c c posets then clause 2 of lemma 41 can be replaced by for every p and every equivalently some regular p there are stationarily many w 2 h such that there exists a w p generic filter g such that for every s w that names a stationary subset of 1 the evaluation of s by g is stationary in v woodin s lemma 41 together with basic theory of generic ultrapowers yields the following theo rem 43 which is a variant of theorem 2 53 of woodin 34 with weaker hypotheses e g no woodin cardinals are needed and weaker conclusion e g the generic embeddings constructed in theorem 43 are not even necessarily wellfounded though the ones from woodin 34 are generic almost huge embeddings essentially fa can be characterized by existence of generically supercom pact elementary embeddings where the possibly illfounded target model has v generics for the relevant forcing theorem 43 minor variant of theorem 2 53 of woodin 34 let be a class of posets closed under restrictions and let 1 be a cardinal the following are equivalent 1 fa 2 for every q every q q every sequence s i i of q name for stationary subsets of 1 and every equivalently some regular q there is a generic elementary embedding j v n such that a hv is in the wellfounded part of n we assume the wellfouned part of n has been transitivized and hv n 1 b j hv n c crit j v 2 d there exists some h n such that q h h is v q generic and for every i n s i h is a stationary subset of 1 we make a remark that is parallel to remark 42 remark 44 suppose 1 and has the additional property that for every q and every cardinal there exists a q name r such that q r and q r 1 this holds for example if is the class of proper posets or 1 ssp posets but not c c c posets then clause 2 d of theorem 43 can be replaced by there exists some h n such that q h h is v q generic filter and every stationary subset of 1 in v h remains stationary in n 18 sean d cox proof of theorem 43 since this is very similar to the proof of theorem 2 53 of woodin 34 we only briefly sketch the proof first assume fa fix q q q a sequence s s i i of q names for stationary subsets of 1 and a large regular since is closed under restrictions q q is an element of and hence the forcing axiom holds for it let r be the set of w 2 h such that 1 w s w and there exists an s correct w q q generic filter hw by lemma 41 r is stationary for each w r let w be the transitive collapse of w and w w w h be the inverse of the mostowski collapsing map then h w 1 w hw is an w 1 w q generic filter q w 1 w q h w crit w w 2 and the evaluation of 1 w s i by h w is a stationary subset of 1 in v for all i let j be the restriction of the nonstationary ideal to r let u be v j generic and j v u n be the resulting generic elementary embedding then standard applications of los theorem see foreman 9 ensure that j has the desired properties mentioned above in particular idr u j h v j h v w 7 w u h v w 7 w u and is an element of the transitivized wellfounded part of n crit j v 2 and h w 7 h w u is an hv q q generic filter such that from the point of view of the generic ultrapower n s i h is a stationary subset of 1 for all i j since was chosen sufficiently large from the start h is also v generic now we prove the converse assume 2 and that q fix any sequence s s i i of q names for stationary subsets of 1 by woodin s theorem 43 it suffices to show that if f h h with f v then there is a w 2 h that is closed under f such that 1 w and there exists a s correct w q generic 1 stationary correct filter let j v n andh n be as in assumption 2 now j hv is closed under j f and j h v n by assumption also note that j h n since h n j hv n and q h v it is routine to check that j hv and j h witness that n there is a model containing 1 and closed under j f for which there exists a j s j s i i j correct generic filter for j q then elementarity of j yields the analogous statement in v completing the proof we now prove theorem 20 from page 4 which is our main tool for preservation of forcing axioms it makes preservation of forcing axioms closely resemble arguments where large cardinal embeddings are lifted after a preparation on the j side where the preparation is designed to provide a master condition both directions of theorem 43 will be used in the proof of theorem 20 the forward direction of theorem 43 using the class in v will be used to obtain a generic embedding j v n with the relevant properties we will generically extend the embedding j to domain v p using the master condition provided by r and then apply the backwards direction of theorem 43 using the class in v p to ensure that fa holds in v p proof of theorem 20 in order to show that fa holds in v p it suffices to verify that clause 2 of theorem 43 holds in v p with respect to the class more precisely we prove that 1 p forces that whenever q is a poset in q q and s i i is a sequence of q names for stationary subsets of 1 then there exists a generic elementary embedding v g m where g is the p name for its generic such that h v g m crit v g 2 h v g is in the wellfounded part of m and there is an h m that is v g q generic such that q h and for every i m s i h is a stationary subset of 1 forcing axioms approachability and stationary set reflection 19 so let p be an arbitrary condition in p q a p name for a poset in q a p name for a condition in q and s s i i a sequence of p q names for stationary subsets of 1 let r be as in the hypotheses of theorem 20 fix a regular such that all objects mentioned so far are in h note that by the assumptions about r each s i remains stationary in v p q r so s can be regarded as a sequence of p q r names of stationary subsets of 1 since p q r is an element of by assumption theorem 43 ensures that there is in some generic extension w of v a generic elementary embedding j v n such that 1 hv 2 is in the wellfounded part of n and has size 1 in n 2 j hv 2 n 3 crit j v 2 4 there is a g h k n that is v generic for p q r and such that p q 1 g h k and n s i g h k s i g h is a stationary subset of 1 for all i note that j g n because g n and j hv 2 n so j v n and g h k satisfy all the hypothesis in the if then clause 3 of the theorem we are currently proving so by that clause there is some p j p that n believes is a lower bound of j g now p may be in the illfounded part of n but this will not matter recall that w is the generic extension of v where the embedding j v n resides work in w for the moment then even if n is illfounded the fact that j p is a partial order is upward absolute to w and w generics are also n generics more precisely in w consider the n extension p of j p i e p x n x n j p and order p by x y iff n x j p y it is routine to check that p is a partial order in w choose a w p generic g such that p g then again it is routine to see that g is also w j p generic in the sense that for every d n such that n d is dense in j p there is some q g such that q n d now consider the generic extension n g a word is in order about what is meant by n g since the standard recursive definition of name evaluation by a generic does not make sense when the ground model is illfounded one way to make sense of n g is via quotients of boolean valued models 11 in the current context let b ron j p and consider the quotient nb g of the b valued model nb see hamkins seabold 17 then since g is generic over n lemma 13 and theorem 16 of 17 ensure that there is a definable isomorphic copy of n inside nb g which we identify with n such that nb g i am the forcing extension of n by g viewed in this way n g is simply nb g and if is a j p name in n then the name evaluation g makes sense if computed from the point of view of nb g which believes that n is wellfounded since p g and p was stronger than every element of j g elementarity of j v n ensures that j g g then the standard argument shows that the map j v g n g defined by g 7 j g is well defined and elementary here j g is computed in n b g n g which makes sense as described above note that j is definable in the extension w g which since g w and w was a generic extension of v is a generic extension of v g 11 alternatively one could use the fact that j hv n to work entirely within n more precisely with the forcing relation of n for the remainder of the proof this alternative would involve extending j hv h v n generically rather than extending the entire map j v n as is done below but the result would be the same namely in this alternative context one would use generic liftings of j hv to prove that h v g fa q which would imply that v g fa q 20 sean d cox next we observe that p must have been 2 distributive this will guarantee that crit j crit j v 2 v g 2 if p were not 2 distributive then there would be some name i i v 1 h v for a new v 1 length sequence of ordinals and hence j j i i v 1 would be a j p name for a new j v 1 v 1 length sequence of ordinals now n sees that the condition p extends the j hv j p generic filter j g and hence that p is a total master condition for the model j hv i e for every d j h v such that d is dense in j p there is a condition weaker than p in d j hv it follows that p already decides all values from the sequence j i i v 1 since p g n g sees that j g j g is already an element of the ground model n by elementarity of j v g sees that g is already an element of the ground model v which is a contradiction let q q g since j h v n and g h n it follows that h n g and j hv g g 7 j g h v n j p is an element of n g furthermore q q g is an element of h by 4 finally we need to verify that from the point of view of n g each s i g h is stationary indeed each s i g h is stationary from the point of view of n by 4 furthermore since p is a regular suborder of p q r and the latter is in observation 40 ensures that p is 1 ssp from the point of view of v by elementarity of j j p is 1 ssp from the point of view of n hence each s i g h remains stationary in n g theorem 20 gives an alternative proof of several preservation results in the literature we highlight a few below 4 1 examples from the literature 4 1 1 the larson example and generalizations larson s 23 theorem that mm is preserved by 2 directed closed forcing can be generalized to show the same is true for virtually any of the standard forcing axioms ma 1 pfa mm fragments of mm etc and their versions theorem 45 suppose is closed under restrictions and under 2 step iterations and let be any cardinal 1 then fa is preserved by 2 directed closed forcing proof suppose v fa p is 2 directed closed q is a p name for a poset in the class and s s i i is a sequence of p q names for stationary subsets of 1 since is closed under 2 step iterations p q let r be the p q name for the trivial forcing then clearly p q r also note that r trivially preserves the stationarity of each s i thus clauses 1 and 2 of the hypotheses of theorem 20 are satisfied we now verify that clause 3 of the assumptions of theorem 20 holds suppose j v n and g h k are as in the hypotheses of clause 3 of theorem 20 since hv n 1 p h v g is a filter and j hv n then j g n and n believes that j g is a directed subset of j p of size 2 moreover by elementarity of j n believes that j p is 2 directed closed hence n believes j g has a lower bound so clause 3 of theorem 20 is also satisfied so theorem 20 ensures that v p fa forcing axioms approachability and stationary set reflection 21 4 1 2 the beaudoin magidor example the classic beaudoin magidor theorem that pfa is con sistent with a nonreflecting stationary subset of s 20 see 2 can be re proved as follows with the class of proper posets assume pfa in v and let p be the forcing to add a nonreflecting stationary subset s of s 20 with initial segments let q be a p name for a proper poset let r be the p q name for the poset to kill the stationarity of s using countable conditions then p q r is proper see 2 moreover if j v n and s h k n are as in the hypotheses of clause 3 of theorem 20 the presence of the r generic club k ensures that s j s is nonstationary in v 2 and hence is a condition in j p and clearly a lower bound for j s so clause 3 of theorem 20 is satisfied and so pfa holds in v s the poset p in this example is actually a member of the class of posets considered in the next example 4 1 3 the yoshinobu example yoshinobu s 35 theorem about preservation of pfa by 1 1 operationally closed forcings can also be viewed as a consequence of theorem 20 suppose pfa holds and p is 1 1 operationally closed roughly this means that in the game gp of length 1 1 where the players create a descending chain of conditions with player ii playing at limit stages and losing if she cannot play at some limit stage 1 player ii has a winning strategy that only depends on the current position of the game i e on the boolean infimum of the conditions played so far and the current ordinal stage but not on the history of the game so far let q be a p name for a proper poset using properness of q and the fact that only depends on the current position yoshinobu designs a p q name r such that the 3 step iteration is proper and if g h k is generic over v for p q r then in v g h k there exists a play p of length 1 such that all proper initial segments of p are in v player ii used at every countable stage of p and the conditions played in p generate g then if g h k n and j v n are as in clause 3 of theorem 20 so in particular j hv j p and j g are elements of n then n believes that j p is a j 1 1 length play of the game j gp where player ii used j at every countable stage and that j g is generated by the conditions played in j p hence since j was used along the way the conditions played in j p have a lower bound which since j g is generated by j p is also a lower bound for j g then v p pfa by theorem 20 5 separation of appproachability properties the notions of disjoint club and disjoint stationary sequences on 2 were introduced in friedman krueger 14 and krueger 22 respectively we say that 2 carries a disjoint club resp disjoint stationary sequence iff there is a stationary s s 21 and a sequence x s such that every x is a club resp stationary subset of and x x whenever 6 are both in s krueger proved theorem 46 theorems 6 3 and 6 5 of krueger 22 assume 2 1 2 the existence of a disjoint club sequence on 2 is equivalent to the assertion that iu 6 is in 2 h 2 i e there are stationarily many w 2 h 2 that are internally unbounded but not internally stationary the existence of a disjoint stationary sequence on 2 is equivalent to the assertion that iu 6 ic in 2 h 2 i e there are stationarily many w 2 h 2 that are internally unbounded but not internally club 22 sean d cox 5 1 proof of theorem 5 in this section we show that pfa does not imply the existence of a disjoint stationary sequence on 2 and thereby show that krueger s theorem 2 is sharp by theorem 46 it suffices to find a model of pfa that also satisfies ic 2 h 2 iu 2 h 2 assume v is a model of pfa then 2 1 2 so we can fix a bijection 2 h 2 let ic be the set of s 21 such that 2 and is an ic model it is routine to check that all but nonstationarily many w ic 2 h 2 are of the form w 2 where w 2 ic let c ic be the poset of closed bounded c 2 such that c s 2 1 ic ordered by end extension by an argument similar to proposition 4 4 of krueger 20 c ic is 2 distributive 12 in particular h 2 is unchanged then the club added by c ic witnesses that in v c ic almost every s 21 has the property that ic and hence that almost every element of iu 2 h 2 is internally club it remains to show that v c ic pfa let q be a c ic name for a proper poset the poset c ic is closed and hence c ic q is proper in particular v v 2 remains stationary let r be the c ic q name for the poset from definition 32 that shoots a continuous 1 chain through v v 2 13 by lemma 34 the poset c ic q r is proper now suppose j v n is a generic elementary embedding with the properties listed in clause 3 of theorem 20 with c ic playing the role of the p from that theorem more precisely assume crit j v 2 j h v n h v is in the wellfounded part of n and there is a c h k n that is v generic for c ic q r the presence of k ensures that in hv c h k h v 2 ic by lemma 21 this is upward absolute to n furthermore j v 2 range h v 2 so n v 2 j ic and hence 7 n c v 2 j c ic and is clearly stronger than j c c by theorem 20 v c pfa completing the proof of theorem 5 5 2 proof of theorem 6 in this section we prove that pfa 1 does not imply the existence of a disjoint club sequence on 2 thereby showing that krueger s theorem 3 is sharp by theorem 46 it suffices to construct a model of pfa 1 such that is iu in 2 h 2 assume v is a model of pfa 1 fix a bijection 2 h 2 and let is be the set of s 21 such that is then almost every w is 2 h 2 is of the form w 2 where w 2 is let c is be the poset of closed bounded c 2 such that c s 2 1 is ordered by end extension as in section 5 1 this poset is 2 distributive and in particular h 2 and is h 2 are computed the same in v and v c is it is also routine to check that 8 v c is is iu in 2 h 2 12 briefly if w h 3 and w ia then w h 2 w 2 w 2 ic since ia ic and any condition in w c ic can be extended to a w generic tower with supremum w 2 this argument uses internal approachability of w then since w 2 ic that generic tower has a lower bound obtained by placing w 2 at the top of the tower in summary every condition in w can be extended to a condition whose upward closure is a w c ic generic filter since the set of such w is stationary standard arguments then imply that c ic is 2 distributive 13 for this application we could just as well have used a version of that poset using countable conditions but we choose to stick with definition 32 since it works just as well forcing axioms approachability and stationary set reflection 23 it remains to show that v c is is a model of pfa 1 let q be a c is name for a proper poset let be a large regular cardinal with c is q h by theorem 20 14 in order to show that pfa 1 holds in v c is it suffices to prove that if j v n is a generic elementary embedding with critical point v 2 such that j h v n h v is in the wellfounded part of n and has size 1 in n and n has an 1 stationary correct v generic filter c h for c is q then n believes that j c c has a lower bound in j c is now since j v 2 range h v 2 it suffices to show that hv 2 is n since then c v 2 will be a condition in j c is below c j c we can without loss of generality assume that q collapses v 2 since c is q is proper it forces that v v 2 is stationary and since it collapses 2 it follows that v c h h v 2 is let t be the c is q name for the internal part of hv 2 then t is forced to be a stationary subset of 1 since c h is an 1 stationary correct filter t c h is stationary in n hence h v 2 is internally stationary from the point of view of n 5 3 proof of theorem 7 we need to prove that the global separation of ic from is 1 follows from mm 2 follows from pfa and 3 does not follow from pfa that pfa does not imply separation of ic from is already follows from our theorem 5 recall in section 5 1 we obtained a model of pfa where ic iu in 2 h 2 so it remains to show either mm or pfa implies global separation of is from ic we start with the mm proof we prove a little more namely theorem 47 mm implies that g 1 is ic is stationary for every regular 2 theorem 47 appeared as theorem 4 4 part 3 of viale 32 however the proof given there is incorrect the proof given there appears to be implicitly using the stronger assumption mm 2 analogous to krueger s proof in 20 and works fine under that stronger assumption we briefly summarize the argument from 32 and where the error occurs a certain poset p 2 q p 2 is defined that forces hv to be a guessing model in is ic the third bullet at the very end of that proof near the end of section 4 claims that if w h is such that w 1 w h 2 and there exists a w p 2 q p 2 generic filter then w is guessing and w is ic the guessing part is correct but such a w is not necessarily in is ic to see why let c c findec v be the p 2 q p 2 name for the poset to shoot a continuous 1 chain through v as in definition 32 then p 2 q p 2 c is proper and forces h v ic 15 hence under mm or just pfa there are stationarily many w as above such that there exists a w p 2 q p 2 c generic filter say g h c so in particular by projecting to the first 2 coordinates there exists a w generic for p 2 q p 2 but the 3 rd coordinate c ensures that w h is an element of ic and hence not an element of is ic one could give a different counterexample under mm by instead letting c name the poset to shoot a continuous 1 chain through v in that context one would be able to find w for which a p 2 q p 2 generic exists yet w is we now give a proof of theorem 47 most of the work was already done in section 3 above proof of theorem 47 assume mm and fix a t 1 that is stationary and costationary let 2 be regular and let q 1 ssp t be the poset given by theorem 37 by woodin s lemma 41 14 viewing c is as the p from that theorem and taking r to be the c is q name for the trivial poset which is trivially forced by c is q to be 1 ssp 15 and is still 1 guessing since p 2 q p 2 forces h v to be indestructibly guessing 24 sean d cox there are stationarily many w h 2 for which there exists a w q 1 ssp t generic filter by corollary 38 w h is an indestructible guessing model and the internal part of w is exactly t in particular w is ic since t was stationary and costationary finally we show that the conclusion of krueger s theorem 4 follows from pfa again we prove something a little stronger namely theorem 48 pfa 1 implies that g 1 is ic is stationary for every regular 2 proof again most of the work was done in section 3 above assume pfa fix a regular 2 and fix any stationary costationary t 1 let q proper t be the poset given by theorem 37 and let s external be the q proper t name for the external part of hv by woodin s lemma 41 there are stationarily many w h 2 such that w 1 w and there exists a w q proper t generic filter g that interprets s external as a stationary subset of 1 by corollary 38 w h is indestructibly 1 guessing its internal part contains the stationary set t hence w h is and its external part is a stationary subset of t c hence w h ic 6 separation of stationary set reflection in this section we prove the various separations of stationary reflection from the introduction the proofs of theorems 10 13 and 18 are similar so we group those together most of the work for these theorems was done already in section 3 the proofs of theorems 11 and 14 are also similar so those are grouped together the main tool for those is theorem 20 in the final subsection we prove theorem 16 6 1 forcing axiom implications here we prove theorems 10 13 and 18 6 1 1 proof of theorem 10 assume pfa 1 hv 2 ic and fix a regular 2 fix a costationary subset t of 1 t will work let q proper t be the poset from theorem 37 that theorem and costationarity of t ensures that q proper t is proper and forces h v 2 is ic so in particular is in the class of posets to which pfa 1 hv 2 ic applies by woodin s lemma 41 there are stationarily many w h 2 such that w 1 w and there exists a w q proper t generic filter g that is correct with respect to stationary subsets of 1 that have names in w by corollary 38 w h is a guessing set and is in is ic it remains to show that w h is diagonally internally reflecting so let r w be a stationary subset of h we need to prove that r w w h is stationary in w h let q i i 1 be the name for the generic filtration of h v and s r be the name for i 1 q i r since q proper t is proper then r remains stationary and it follows that s r names a stationary subset of 1 also notice that since r v then in particular r v and so 9 i s r q i is an element of the ground model now the name s r can be taken to be an element of w so s s r g is really stationary in v now q i g i 1 is a filtration of w h then for every i s q i g is an element of r and also by 9 an element of w this completes the proof of theorem 10 forcing axioms approachability and stationary set reflection 25 6 1 2 proof of theorem 13 this is very similar to the proof of theorem 10 so we only briefly sketch it assume pfa 1 hv 2 ia let q proper 1 be the poset from theorem 37 with t 1 by that theorem hv 2 is forced to be indestructibly guessing and have internal part containing t guessing models are never internally approachable so in particular the poset forces hv 2 ia and hence the forcing axiom pfa 1 hv 2 ia applies to it so by woodin s lemma 41 there are stationarily many w h 2 for which there exists a g that is w generic and stationary correct and corollary 38 ensures that such w are indestructibly guessing and have internal part containing t 1 hence internally club the proof that w is internally diagonally reflecting is identical to the corresponding proof in section 6 1 1 6 1 3 proof of theorem 18 assume mm 1 hv 2 is and consider the poset q 1 ssp from theorem 37 taking the t from that theorem to be the empty set that theorem yields that hv 2 is forced to be indestructibly guessing and have internal part exactly t and hence to not be in is so q 1 ssp is a poset to which mm 1 hv 2 is is applicable by woodin s lemma 41 there are stationarily many w 2 h 2 such that there is some w q 1 ssp generic filter that is stationary correct about names for stationary subsets of 1 lying in w by corollary 38 it follows that r sup w is stationary in sup w whenever r w and r is stationary in cof 6 2 preservation results here we prove theorems 11 and 14 6 2 1 proof of theorem 11 assume v is a model of pfa 1 hv 2 ic by theorem 10 drpinternal gis holds so in particular wrp holds then by foreman magidor shelah 12 2 1 2 16 fix a bijection 2 h 2 and define ic s 21 ic it is routine to see that for all but nonstationarily many w ic 2 h 2 w is of the form w 2 as in krueger 20 let pnric be the following partial order nric stands for nonreflecting in ic conditions are functions f cof 2 for some 2 such that for every ic the set f 1 is nonstationary in the ordering is by function extension then 1 pnric is closed and 2 distributive lemma 4 1 of 20 so in particular hv 2 h v pnric 2 and ic 2 h 2 v is equal to ic 2 h 2 v pnric 2 if g is v pnric generic then by identifying g with 1 g 1 in v g we have g is a stationary subset of s 20 lemma 4 2 of 20 g is nonstationary for all ic 16 one could probably modify the arguments of velickovic and todorcevic to prove 2 1 2 already follows from the non plus version pfahv 2 ic we did not check this however 26 sean d cox rpic fails in v g we briefly sketch the argument set g z 2 sup z g then g is a stationary subset of 2 if w as defined above and sk h 3 g g w h 2 w where is some wellorder of h v g 3 then since g w 2 is nonstationary and cf w 2 1 it is straightforward to see that g w is nonstationary this shows that g can reflect to at most nonstationarily many members of but if rpic held then any stationary subset of 2 would reflect to stationarily many members of see foreman todorcevic 13 lemma 8 we use theorem 20 to prove that pnric preserves pfa 1 hv 2 ic let q be a pnric name for a proper poset that forces the ground model s h 2 is not in ic i e that h v pnric 2 ic since hv 2 h v pnric 2 pnric q forces h v 2 ic let r be the pnric q name for the trivial poset which is trivially forced to be 1 ssp then pnric q r is a poset to which the axiom pfa 1 hv 2 ic applies this verifies clause 1 of theorem 20 we now verify clause 3 of theorem 20 suppose j v n is a generic elementary embedding satisfying the assumptions of that clause where in particular g h k n is generic over v for pnric q r and correct with respect to stationary subsets of 1 in particular h v g h is correct fromn s point of view about the fact that the external part ofhv 2 is stationary recall from above that pnric q forces h v 2 ic in other words hv 2 ic n now j v 2 range h v 2 so v 2 j ic hence j g g is a condition in j pnric since by the definition of the forcing pnric there are no requirements whatsoever at points which are not in ic this verifies clause 3 of theorem 20 and hence by that theorem pfa 1 hv 2 ic holds in v pnric finally suppose in addition that pfa held in the ground model the poset pnric is 1 1 tactically closed as in yoshinobu 35 the argument is virtually identical to the proof of example 1 on page 751 of 35 hence pnric preserves pfa by the main theorem of 35 alternatively one could use theorem 20 to run basically the same argument as the beaudoin magidor example in section 4 1 2 above 6 2 2 proof of theorem 14 this proof is very similar to the proof of theorem 11 above so we only briefly sketch it assume that the ground model v satisfies pfa 1 hv 2 ia and define ia and pnria similarly to the way that ic and pnric were defined in section 6 2 1 with ia playing the role here that ic played there then pnria has the same properties that pnric had with the obvious modifications in particular if g is generic for pnria then rpia 2 fails in v g again use theorem 20 to show that pnria preserves pfa 1 hv 2 ia this is basically the same argument as above except in the current situation the reason that hv 2 ia n is because it is indestructibly guessing and guessing models are never internally approachable this ensures just as in the proof above that j g g is a condition in j pnria the rest is identical to the proof above so we omit the argument 6 2 3 proof of theorem 16 assume that v satisfies mm 1 hv 2 is let p p 2 be the poset from section 1 of aspero krueger yoshinobu 1 conditions are 1 sized subsets p of 2 such forcing axioms approachability and stationary set reflection 27 that p w is nonstationary in w whenever w 2 1 a condition q is stronger than p if q p and for every y q p y is not a subset of p section 1 of 1 proves that p is 2 strategically closed in particular it is 1 ssp and h v 2 hv p 2 p adds a stationary subset of 2 that does not reflect to any set of size 1 hence rp 2 fails in the extension it remains to verify that p preserves mm 1 hv 2 is again we use theorem 20 let q be a p name for an 1 ssp poset that forces the ground model is not in is and let r be the p q name for the trivial forcing which is of course 1 ssp since h v 2 hv p 2 p q r forces hv 2 is and is 1 ssp so clause 1 of theorem 20 is satisfied now suppose j v n is as in the hypotheses of clause 3 of theorem 20 using the notation from that clause then v v 2 is nonstationary in hv g h k h v g h and so g being the generic subset of v v 2 added by p is also nonstationary in hv g h hence j g g is nonstationary in v 2 from the point of view of n moreover since g is nonreflecting in v g then g is nonstationary for every v 2 and this is upward absolute from hv g to n so j g g is a condition in j p to see that it is stronger than every condition in j g consider some p g then j g g p j p and if y g p then there is some q g with y q and hence y q p without loss of generality we can assume q is stronger than p and so y is not a subset of p by definition of the forcing this shows that j g g is stronger than every condition in j g and hence the assumptions of clause 3 of theorem 20 is satisfied and so v p satisfies mm 1 hv 2 is 7 closing remarks as mentioned in the introduction we do not know if the implication rpinternal rpis from the fuchino usuba theorem 9 or the implication rpis rpiu from 2 can be reversed these questions are very similar since separating either implication would require some stationary sets to reflect only to the external parts of members of 2 v we suspect a solution to one of them would likely solve the other and conjecture that neither can be reversed the following theorem lends some support to this conjecture theorem 49 martin s maximum implies that there is a stationary subset s of h 2 such that for stationarily many w is 2 h 2 s reflects to w but not internally 17 proof fix a stationary costationary subset t of 1 and set st c h 2 t c let qt q 1 ssp t 2 be the 1 ssp poset from theorem 37 by woodin s lemma 41 there are stationarily many w 2 h 3 for which there exists a w qt generic filter let r be this stationary set by corollary 38 if w r then w w h 2 has internal part exactly t which implies that w is and that st c w w is nonstationary on the other hand stationarity of t c ensures that st c w h 2 t c w is stationary since in fact st c z is stationary for any set z h 2 such that 1 z then r 1 w h 2 w r is as required 17 i e w is and s w is stationary but s w w is nonstationary 28 sean d cox
