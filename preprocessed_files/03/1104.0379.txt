andrews fife ky 16 9 sx scotland uk rr cs st andrews ac uk abstract we give a calculus for reasoning about the first order fragment of classical logic that is adequate for giving the truth conditions of intuitionistic kripke frames and outline a proof theoretic soundness and completeness proof which we believe is conducive to automation 1 a semantic calculus for intuitionistic kripke models in rothenberg 2010 we use correspondence theory blackburn et al 2001 to give a cut free calculus for reasoning about intuitionistic kripke models kripke 1965 using a fragment of first order classical logic definition 1 partially shielded formulae we define the partially shielded fragment psf of first order formulae 1 2 p x iff p is an atomic propositional variable or an atomic first order formula with a free variable x 3 a x b x and a x b x iff a x b x are in psf 4 rxy where r is a fixed atomic binary relation 5 y rxy a y b y iff a x and b x are in psf proposition 1 a formula in psf is either of the form rxy or has at most one free variable proof by induction on the structure of the formula we give the calculus g 3 c psf in figure 1 which is useful for reasoning about sequents of formulae in psf a variant of it was introduced in rothenberg 2010 based on ideas from a calculus for the guarded fragment gf of first order formulae given in dyckhoff and simpson 2006 p p ax l a b a b l a b a

fresh for the conclusion of the r rule and that y in the premisses of the l and r rules is an abbreviation of y rxy a y b y proposition 2 standard structural rules rothenberg 2010 the following rules are admissible in g 3 c psf w c a a cut proposition 3 negri 2007 let g 3 c psf be g 3 c psf plus the following geometric rules rxx refl rxz rxy ryz rxy ryz tran rxy px py rxy px mono where px py in the mono rule are atomic http arxiv org abs 1104 0379 v 3 corollary 4 negri 2007 the standard structural rules proposition 2 are admissible in g 3 c psf remark 1 earlier work on geometric rules for modal logics can be found in simpson 1994 remark 2 the labelled sequent calculus g 3 i negri 2007 and dyckhoff and negri 2011 can be thought of as an alternative form of g 3 c psf that hides the quantifiers and incorporates the mono rule into the axiom ax definition 2 translation of propositional formulae into psf def a b def a b a b def y rxy a b p def p x a b def a b where the translation of a b requires that the free variable of a b is x and y 6 x and p x uniquely corresponds to p recall that r formulae occur only as strict subformulae in the translation the extension is adapted to sequents naturally where all formulae have the same free variable definition 3 kripke semantics of psf let m w r be a kripke model and let x be a function from first order variables into w then 1 m 1 iff m x 1 for all x w 2 m p x iff a m p x iff m x p x for all x w where p x is an atomic propositional variable b m p x iff m x px for some x w where p x is an atomic first order formula 3 m a b iff m a and m b 4 m a b iff either m a or m b 5 m rxy iff x y r 6 m rxy a y b y iff m x rxy a y b y iff m rxy and either m 1 a y or m b y this is extended naturally for sequents of formulae by m iff either m 1 or m theorem 5 soundness and completeness rothenberg 2010 let m w r be a kripke model for int then m iff g 3 c psf proof using definition 3 we note the rules of g 3 c psf are sound w r t the properties of m for completeness we show by induction of the structure of sequents the sizes of and the structure of each formula lemma 6 right monotonicity the rule rxy px py rxy py mono is admissible in g 3 c psf proof using cut lemma 7 general monotonicity the rules rxy ax ay rxy ax rxy ax ay rxy ay are admissible in g 3 c psf proof by induction on the derivation depth and formula size theorem 8 let g be a multisuccedent sequent calculus for int e g m g 3 ip troelstra and schwichtenberg 2000 then g iff g 3 c psf proof by induction on the derivation height an outline of the proof is as follows 1 hyperextend avron 1991 g to a hypersequent calculus hg 2 show g iff hg h straightforward 3 extend definition 2 so that components in hypersequents are translated with unique free variables 4 show hg h iff g 3 c psf h note that instances of mono or trans can be eliminated from g 3 c psf proofs of sequents with a single free variable corollary 9 soundness and completeness let g be a multisuccedent sequent calculus for int then g is sound and complete w r t int proof follows from theorem 8 2 future work we expect that adapting this work to single succedent calculi e g g 3 ip troelstra and schwichtenberg 2000 should be straightforward an obvious extension is to adapt this work to hypersequent calculi for superintuitionistic logics e g in avron 1991 for logics with geometric kripke semantics rothenberg 2010 this should be straightforward this work can be adapted to cut free sequent calculi for modal logics in a straightforward manner using similar calculi for guarded formulae such as dyckhoff and simpson 2006 the reader is also referred to ohlbach et al 2001 for related work adapting this work to extensions of gentzen calculi should be possible by applying translations of their data structures into sequents of psf and using a limited form of proof search on schematic rules such work may be easier if the data structure allows relations between points in a kripke frame to be explicit theorem 8 may be extended to hg iff g 3 c psf where is a translation from sequents of psf into hypersequents based on the transitive unfolding procedure from rothenberg
