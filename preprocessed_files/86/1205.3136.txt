microsoft word raschkejuly 2013 arxiv submitted minor revision 1 statistical modeling of ground motion relations for seismic hazard analysis mathias raschke freelancer stolze schrey str 1 65195 wiesbaden germany mathiasraschke t online de we introduce a new approach for ground motion relations gmr in the probabilistic seismic hazard analysis psha being influenced by the extreme value theory of mathematical statistics therein we understand a gmr as a random function we derive mathematically the principle of area equivalence wherein two alternative gmrs have an equivalent influence on the hazard if these gmrs have equivalent area functions this includes local biases an interpretation of the difference between these gmrs an actual and a modeled one as a random component leads to a general overestimation of residual variance and hazard beside this we discuss important aspects of classical approaches and discover discrepancies with the state of the art of stochastics and statistics model selection and significance test of distribution assumptions extreme value statistics we criticize especially the assumption of logarithmic normally distributed residuals of maxima like the peak ground acceleration pga the natural distribution of its individual random component equivalent to exp 0 of joyner and boore 1993 is the generalized extreme value we show by numerical researches that the actual distribution can be hidden and a wrong distribution assumption can influence the psha negatively as the negligence of area equivalence does finally we suggest an estimation concept for gmrs of psha with a regression free variance estimation of the individual random component we demonstrate the advantages of event specific gmrs by analyzing data sets from the peer strong motion database and estimate event specific gmrs therein the majority of the best models base on an anisotropic point source approach the residual variance of logarithmized pga is significantly smaller than in previous models we validate the estimations for the event with the largest sample by empirical area functions which indicate the appropriate modeling of the gmr by an anisotropic point source model the constructed distances like the joyner boore distance do not work well for event specific gmrs we discover also a strong relation between magnitude and the squared expectation of the pgas being integrated in the geo space for the event specific gmrs one of our secondary contributions is the simple modeling of anisotropy for a point source model ground motion relation probabilistic seismic hazard analysis area equivalence regression analysis extreme value statistics model selection statistical test random function 1 introduction the level of local seismic impact is estimated for modern building codes and the earthquake resistant design of industrial facilities by probabilistic seismic hazard analysis psha as a part of seismology and earthquake engineering therein the average annual exceedance frequency of local earthquake ground motion intensity is estimated an important element of psha is the ground motion relation gmr which describes the relation between the local ground motion intensity and different event parameters such as the magnitude bommer and submitted minor revision 2 abrahamson 2006 it is also called ground motion prediction equation we prefer the term gmr of atkinson 2006 because we research an appropriate relation for the psha that needs not to be the best prediction and its residual variance for a single event the previous gmrs are mostly modeled by a statistical regression analysis strasser et al 2009 wherein the event parameters are predictors douglas 2001 2002 provides a good overview of gmrs being published before 2002 and douglas 2003 gives an excellent overview of all aspects of gmrs like estimation methods or source models therein the physical unit of local ground motion intensity is the peak ground acceleration pga or the maximum of another type of local time history the parameters of current gmrs are fixed not event specific including the depth parameter the conditional probability distribution of the local ground motion intensity is generally modeled by the logarithmic normal log normal distribution in the gmr which implies a normal distribution for the logarithmized ground motion intensity joyner and boore 1993 strasser et al 2009 this approach results in unrealistically high estimations of ground motion intensities for low exceedance frequency stepp et al 2001 abrahamson et al 2002 bommer and abrahamson 2006 which has not been improved by the next generation of gmr nga abrahamson et al 2008 beside this truncation of the log normal distribution was suggested to avoid overestimations but choosing the truncation point is difficult according to strasser et al 2008 therein statistical estimation methods for truncation points raschke 2011 have not been considered we generally note a lack of consideration of current knowledge of stochastics and statistics in the research of gmr for example it is known for a long time that the statistical significance of regression models of gmr should be validated joyner and boore 1981 but many ngas are not validated in this sense s tab 2 beside this at least the individual random component 0 of joyner and boore 1993 of the pga should follow an extreme value distribution according to the extreme value statistics leadbetter at al 1983 coles 2001 dupuis and flemming 2006 have introduced the concept of extreme value statistics into gmr but their paper was not considered any further in the following section on regression models for gmrs we criticize important statistical aspects of previous gmr and briefly call arguments for the extreme value distribution of the individual random component in sec 3 however our break with the traditional approaches to gmrs is deeper in sec 4 we mathematically derive the area equivalence for gmrs in psha inspired by equivalences in max stable random fields schlather 2002 kabluchko et al 2009 therein gmrs are random functions which include event specific gmrs and distinction between gmrs for an actual prediction and gmrs for the psha we also introduce an approach to an anisotropic point source model in this section submitted minor revision 3 in sec 5 we numerically research the detectability of the distribution model and the influence of this and other items like the area equivalence on psha then we suggest an estimation concept for our approach to gmr in sec 6 including a regression free estimation of the variance of the individual random component we partly apply this concept to nine suitable data sets and research the link between the event specific gmr and the magnitude finally we conclude our results in the last section we follow here the rules of statistics use its terms s upton and cook 2008 and refer to the appendix by the letter a 2 regression model for gmr 2 1 basic formulation the gmr is usually formulated by a regression model with the basic formulation lindsey 1996 rawlings et al 1998 montgomery et al 2006 0 vyvegyegy xx 1 y is the predicted variable response variable dependent variable conditional variable or regressand the regression function g x includes a parameter vector which is estimated the predictors independent variables predicting variables or regressors are the elements of the random vector x x 1 x 2 xm e are the expectations and v are the variances the random variable is the random component residual random term or measurement error and determines the cumulative distribution function cdf fy of y under condition of x if g x 0 and v is proportional to g 2 x then we write the equivalent formulation 1 1 2 xxx gvyvegyegy 2 we prefer this formulation for gmrs wherein y is the pga or something similar because the expectation is a very important characterization of a random variable and can be neglected under certain conditions sec 4 1 if y 0 then we can logarithm and formulate the popular model for gmrs douglas 2001 abrahamson et al 2008 ln 0 ln ln vyvegyegy xx 3 it is assumed for most gmrs for psha that is normally distributed joyner and boore 1993 strasser et al 2009 this implies a model according to eq 2 with log normally distributed the link between eq 2 3 is johnson et al 1994 eq 14 8 2 exp vggye xx and 4 a 1 exp exp 2 exp vvgyv x 4 b 2 exp exp v 4 c submitted minor revision 4 we apply eq 3 4 simultaneously even if is not exactly log normally distributed johnson et al 1994 eq 12 67 with johnson 0 a typical formulation for a gmr is douglas 2002 0 0 0 ln 321 22 3210 hdrxrrmg ssx 5 with predicting variables magnitude m source distance d and r and indicator variable xs and its parameter s for the site condition the source depth is considered by h and can be a parameter or an event specific predictor there are many variants and extensions for g x douglas 2002 abrahamson et al 2008 2 2 random components estimation methods and errors the random components resp are independently and identically distributed iid variables and the predictors are measured exactly in simple regression models for such cases the least squared ls estimation can be applied which is equivalent to the maximum likelihood ml estimation for normally distributed residuals s rawlings et al 1998 p 77 this is not popular in seismology e g castellaro et al 2006 incorrectly claim that the residuals have to be normally distributed for the ls regression the ls method has often been used for gmrs and is extended to random components that are not iid douglas 2003 sec 11 gives an overview of approaches from before 2003 the two most important approaches seem to be the one and two stage regression method with the following random components joyner and boore 1993 with assumption of normal distribution 0 00 eee sese 6 wherein e is event specific s is site specific and 0 has an individual realization for each site station and event we prefer the product formulation according to eq 2 with 1 00 xx eqivalentactualqqseqse ggeeeee 7 wherein the additional pseudo random component q resp q results from the ratio between actual and equivalent function g x according to sec 4 a general distribution assumption is not required but it is obvious that q has a finite upper bound and a lower bound larger than 0 for a fixed distance d that is one reason why q cannot be log normally distributed in other gmrs the component s resp s had been replaced by site specific predictors xs in eq 5 but there is no proof that one additional predictor can completely replace s resp s and we doubt this because site response is very complex independent of this one condition of the regression models of joyner and boore 1993 is that predictors m and r do not include a measurement error however magnitudes are not measured exactly rhoades 1997 considers the known variance of the seismological magnitude estimation in his regression submitted minor revision 5 analysis for gmr it is not considered that this known error needs not to be the only one the actual error of the seismological estimation can be higher according to giardini 1984 arguments for this the source mechanism influences the ground motion campbell 1981 and 1993 crouse and mcguire 1996 sadigh et al 1997 this acts like a measurement error of magnitudes in the gmr an application of fewer classes of source mechanism would reduce but not eliminate it furthermore the inter event variability e can be interpreted as an error in magnitudes because the seismological magnitudes can be exact for a certain aspect of the rupture process but do not need to be exact for the gmr the actual magnitude of gmr could be a non measurable latent variable which is estimated by common magnitudes with an error in the sense of statistical error in models cheng and ness 1999 sec 1 1 the considerable differences between the estimated residual variances of gmrs for one sample of pgas but for different magnitude scales see e g atkinson and boore 1995 tab 5 support this assumption additionally the magnitudes of the analyzed sample could be from different scales e g bommer et al 2007 which acts like a measurement error the source to site distance d is also treated as exactly measured predictor but it should include an error because there are many definitions for this distance douglas 2003 sec 9 how could it be possible that all these measures for the same physical aspect act without a measurement error moreover the distances are determined by the seismological source estimation which also includes errors even if parameters of this error would be known it would be difficult to consider it in a regression analysis personal communication with pcw douglas spring 2013 beside this the influence of the source depth is often reduced to a fixed parameter for a defined class of earthquakes e g shallow events in other gmrs ambraseys and bommer 1991 h is the seismological epicenter depth but neither is the influence of the source depth the same for every earthquake nor is the seismological depth exactly measured in both cases a kind of measurement error is neglected furthermore it is assumed for current gmr that the parameter vector of the gmr is the same for each event joyner and boore 1993 abrahamson et al 2008 there are more estimation methods for a regression model e g rawlings et al 1998 sec 10 stromeyer et al 2004 the models for unknown measurement errors of predictors cheng and ness 1999 sec 4 are not applied for gmr as far as we know beside this the aspect of estimating the estimation errors of the regression parameters is not considered in all approaches these standard errors can be easily estimated for a simple linear ls regression with iid random components rawlings et al 1988 sec 4 6 but it is more difficult for models with random effects joyner and boore 1993 applied the monte carlo simulation to submitted minor revision 6 estimate the estimation error rhoades 1997 has computed this standard errors using the likelihood function chen and tsai 2002 also give a method to estimate the standard error but abrahamson and young 1992 do not give any advice for this issue regarding their procedure we draw attention here to the fact that an estimation error can be computed by the jackknife technique quenouille 1956 efron 1979 this also applies for clustered data according to raschke 2012 2013 as is the case for the mixed effects the estimation error can be applied directly to construct the confidence range and verify the statistical significance of a predictor and its parameter 2 3 the danger of over parameterization we could explain the entire variance of a predicted variable y or ln y by a regression model if we use a large number of predictors and related parameters although not all predictors have an actual influence rawlings et al 1993 fig 8 2 the question is how can we distinguish between significant and insignificant predictors and or parameters different statistical tools can solve this problem the first one is the significance test for the regression parameters i in g x resp g x ixi we test here if i 0 i 0 or i 0 for a defined significance level 5 is often used and recommended here the last two variants are applied when physical reason bounds the influence of a predictor e g a larger magnitude should be related to a larger pga in this case we can be sure with a probability of 100 that the actual parameter i does not have a contrary sign the smaller is the more rigorous is the test the t test is such a test rawlings et al 1998 sec 1 6 and 5 3 which has seldom been applied for gmr e g by joyner and boore 1981 molas and yamazaki 1995 and ambraseys et al 2005 pcw douglas march 2013 note that the classical t test cannot be applied without modification or acceptance of inaccuracies to the case of mixed effects clustered data the significance of a published gmr is also examined implicitly by published standard errors of the parameter estimation if the related quantile corresponding with is not smaller larger than 0 then it implies statistical significance this is the case for the estimations of joyner and boore 1993 tab 3 and rhoades 1993 tab 1 applying model selection criterions in the model building rawlings et al 1998 sec 7 is a further possibility for guaranteeing the statistical significance e g the akaike information criterion aic or the bayesian information criterion the significance has to be verified for each statistical model otherwise danger of over parameterization arises this problem applies to a considerable amount of gmrs we list 15 examples in tab 1 this is also an issue in other researches e g raschke and th rmer 2008 submitted minor revision 7 tab 1 examples of gmrs without sufficient validation of significance model selection refer to examples reference description 1 youngs et al 1995 the dependency of the residual variance on the magnitude had been tested by a likelihood ratio test but a test for the parameters of the primary model the gmr is not mentioned 2 douglas 2002 2003 many listed gmrs have been developed without a significance test or statistical model selection 3 chen and tsai 2002 gmr eq 9 tab 2 use magnitude related parameters 5 and 6 which have a very large standard error contrary signs are relatively likely 4 boore and atkinson 2007 the ngas have been developed without a significance test pcw boore 5 enescu and enescu 2007 the anisotropic gmr for vrancea region romania include 90 parameters tab 1 without a significance test or something similar 6 s rensen et al 2010 the anistropic macroseismic gmr for vrancea region romania include more than 30 parameters without a significance test or something similar pcw stromeyer 7 bommer et al 2007 no standard errors are given for the ten regression parameters tab 2 no significance test or something similar is mentioned 8 campbell and bozorgnia 2008 a test is not mentioned for the nga but applied with 10 pcw campbell the test variant is not very strict the accepted probability that one parameter is insignificant is 0 65 1 1 0 1 10 in case of 10 independent parameters 16 parameters are estimated tab 2 9 chiou and youngs 2008 the dependency of the residual variance on the magnitude had been tested by a likelihood ratio test but a test for the parameters of the primary model the gmr is not mentioned 10 abrahamson and silva 2008 no statistical test is mentioned and the standard errors of the parameter estimation of the nga with many parameters are not given a peer report is referred to for the last one but this report is not accessible 11 idriss 2007 no statistical test is mentioned and the standard errors of the parameter estimation of this nga are not given 12 al atik et al 2010 five references are listed in tab 3 and 4 for decomposition of the residual spreading we examined the references atkinson 2006 pcw atkinson chen and tsai 2002 lin et al 2011 pcw lin and morikawa et al 2008 therein statistical significance was not validated 13 anderson and uchiyama 2011 they have investigated site and path effects in gmr without a validation of significance the range of only one standard error of site and path related mean residuals in fig 6 mostly include 0 this is an indication of insignificance 14 scherbaum et al 2004 a criterion of model selection for gmrs has been formulated without proof or derivation according to the rules of statistics s our sec a 5 it is applied in other researches e g by stafford et al 2008 therein the number of parameters is not considered 15 kaklamanos and baise 2010 a criterion of model selection for gmrs is introduced without proof or derivation according to the rules of statistics therein the number of parameters is not considered 2 4 the test of the distribution assumption any statistical distribution model should be validated d augustino and stephens 1986 this also applies to the residual distribution of a gmr in psha although a distribution assumption is not necessary for the ls regression a powerful goodness of fit test is the best method of examining the distribution assumption as the anderson darling ad test for a normal distribution landry and lepage 1992 contrary to the aforementioned t test the test is the more rigorous the larger the selected significance is there are such tests for different distribution functions with estimated parameters stephens 1986 if all parameters are known then the distribution is fully specified and the classical kolmogorov smirnov ks test can be applied if the ks test is applied to estimated parameters then the test does not work raschke 2009 if there is not an applicable goodness of fit test for the distribution type used then a quantile plot q q plot can be used for a visual qualitative test as done by dupuis and flemming 2006 for residuals with a mixed non normal distribution however there is no objective criterion for rejecting the distribution hypothesis in this case a histogram is a submitted minor revision 8 kind of parameter free distribution model but it is not a tool for validating a distribution model not mentioned by d augustino and stephens 1986 because there is no objective criterion for rejection and there are many possible histograms for a sample we state that the assumption of normally distributed resp its components in eq 3 is often not correctly validated for gmrs for example ambraseys and bommer 1991 ambraseys and simpson 1996 ambraseys et al 1996 atkinson and boore 1995 spudich et al 1999 douglas and smit 2001 atkinson 2004 and kalkan and g lkan 2004 have neither assumed nor tested a distribution model beside this the assumed normal distribution of has been tested by the inappropriate ks test in other studies e g mcguire 1977 campbell 1981 abrahamson 1988 monguilner et al 2000 restrepo velez and bommer 2003 the quantile plot e g chang et al 2001 bommer et al 2004 and the histogram e g atkinson 2006 beyer and bommer 2007 morikawa et al 2008 have also been applied to validate the normal distribution although these methods are not appropriate note that even though seems to be normally distributed it needs not to be s sec 5 the inappropriate test of a distribution assumption is also a problem in other researches e g of flood hazard in germany raschke and th rmer 2008 3 the distribution of the maximum of a random sequence the popular assumption for gmr for pgas that all random components are log normally distributed normally distributed joyner and boore 1993 strasser et al 2009 is in contradiction to the extreme value theory according to this special field of stochastics and statistics the maximum of a sample y max z 1 z 2 zi zn of iid random variables has a generalized extreme value distribution in most cases ged fisher and tippett 1928 gnedenko 1943 beirlant et al 2004 de haan and ferreira 2006 the maximum of a sequence of non iid random variables also has a ged under some weak conditions leadbetter et al 1983 part ii and iii falk et al 2011 part iii its cdf is written with the extreme value index shape parameter scale parameter and location parameter 0 1 0 1 exp 1 yyyg 8 a 0 expexp yyg 8 b with the fr chet domain for 0 the weibull domain for 0 and the gumbel domain for 0 the latter one is also called the gumbel distribution a fundamental property of the ged is max stability this means that the maximum max y 1 y 2 of extreme value distributed variable y is again extreme value distributed with the same extreme value index if y would be log normally distributed then max y 1 y 2 would not be log normally distributed neither the submitted minor revision 9 normal nor the log normal distributions are max stable this problem is typical for the combination of the two horizontal components y 1 y 2 of the earthquake record it could be defined by a maximum max y 1 y 2 douglas 2003 sec 6 all combinations with a maximum definition of douglas 2003 sec 6 2 4 5 result in a classical extreme value for which the ged is the natural distribution the log normal assumption for random component 0 is wrong in this case according to the state of the art of stochastics and statistics we consider here only maxima in case of other combinations of the horizontal components it is also unlikely that random component 0 becomes log normally distributed we have investigated the distribution of the combination arithmetic mean geometric mean and vectorial addition of gumbel distributed components 01 and 02 numerically sec a 2 the log normal assumptions are rejected the argument of missing max stability of the log normal assumption also applies for sub sections of the ground motion time history if the sub maxima of not overlapping sub sections of the time history are log normally distributed then the maximum of the entire time history cannot be log normally distributed exception all sub maxima are identical log normal assumptions would also contradict all our experiences with extreme values h sler et al 2011 raschke 2011 2012 2013 we briefly investigate the possible domain of attraction for pgas and analyze the tail of three acceleration time histories fig 1 the tails are exponentially distributed which indicates the gumbel domain of attraction for the maxima of the accelerations s coles 2001 sec 4 besides dupuis and flemming 2006 have estimated a gmr with ged for the residuals of pga with extreme value index 0 which also indicates the gumbel domain a 0 01 0 1 1

function is a function randomly selected from a set of functions population schlather 2002 theorem 1 and its proof we use different symbols applies a measurable random function w s t 0 to construct a max stable process this max stable process max y si refers to the maxima at site s from all point events i with local event intensity y si moiw si t therein t is a source allocation resp the source point in the sense of psha not necessary a point source being part of a homogeneous poisson process in the geo space and at a moment scale mo 0 with density mo 2 its annual maximum max y si has the cdf g y exp y with annual exceedance function aef y of annual average frequency of exceedance y s y according to the limit law for extremes coles sec 7 3 this distribution is equivalent for different sets of random functions if their expectations e vo of the volume dswv s o ts are equal this construction can be interpreted as homogeneous seismicity with mow s t g x the spatial distance s t is part of the distance elements of the predicting vector x beside the event parameters in sub vector xe of x it is scaled by the earthquake magnitude with m ln mo without influence on the shape of w s t resp g x the magnitude is exponentially distributed without an upper bound according to theorem 1 of schlather the aef y is equal for different gmrs if the expectation e vo is equal for any fixed event parameters like magnitude m and h furthermore we can extend this equivalence to mow s t s g x according to theorem 2 of schlather 2002 pcw kabluchko 2012 if the random component has the expectation e 1 this includes that for an event is sxssx ss dgdg if the variance and the spatial correlation of s is relative small in all cases we can interpret a gmr as a random function in space being an element of a set population different sets of gmr act equivalent if the expectations e vo are equivalent note that the variance and the distribution type of have no influence on y this could be the reason why cornel 1968 did not explicitly consider a random component in his gmr for the psha with exponentially distributed magnitudes without upper bound he did not need and could have find this out by numerical researches non mathematicians can check all results in the same way this equivalence of gmrs works only for exponentially distributed magnitudes without upper bound we introduce the area function k y to derive a general equivalence of gmrs being independent of the magnitude distribution for this purpose we consider at first gmr submitted minor revision 11 g x in a simple one dimensional geo space as shown in fig 2 b we use an example with two maxima of g x to demonstrate the general application of this equivalence for fixed event parameters and a fixed value y the gmr covers a certain area of all points with y g x the area function k y is for homogeneous site conditions 0 1 x 1 xx 1 tx 1 gotherwisegyforgdgyk 9 the first derivation is the related area density measuring the amount of points with y g x dyydkyk 10 the area function is defined according to fig 2 a and b for a fixed source point t but we could also fix s and draw g x at t although it acts at site s we reflect the gmr in this way for 1 d geo space as shown in fig 2 c we have an equivalent formulation for k y with 0 1 x 1 xx 1 sx 1 gotherwisegyforgdgyk 11 the reflection becomes complicated for the two dimensional geo space but eq 9 11 still apply we can illustrate the reflection for an isoline with fixed y g x as shown in fig 2 d for an anisotropic gmr for a point source and an isotropic gmr for a line source in fig 2 e a b c d e fig 2 gmr and area equivalence a g x in a 1 d geo space b resulting area function k y c g x for fixed source point t and reflected version for fixed s d 2 d geo space with isolines of g x for different t light gray and reflected isoline dark gray for fixed s for anisotropic point source model e as d but for a line source now let us assume the case of homogeneous seismicity each point t in the geo space represents a source allocation with equivalent occurrence intensity equivalent g x with x s t xe with event parameter xe m h xi and its multivariate probability density function fe the distances d resp r of the gmr are determined by s t h and the source model we formulate for the aef y of annual average frequency of exceedance y s y 1 2 tsxxxtxsxsx x t eeyee ddvgyvgyeyffy e 12 therein the cdf fy is parameterized by its expectation e y s and variance v y s according to eq 2 v can be influenced by xe but does not include q eq 12 is oriented on the absolute probability integral of mcguire 1995 but there are many equivalent submitted minor revision 12 formulations one includes a replacement of the integration on t by the area density k y and the integration on y g x with ez yeee dzdvzyvzyeyffzky e xssxxx 1 2 13 because the integration in the geo space in eq 12 is nothing else than a computation of the amount of points with y g x in the sense of measure theory billingsley 1995 chap 2 now it is obvious that two gmrs g 1 x g 2 x result in equivalent hazard with 1 y 2 y if the area density is equal with k 1 y k 2 y resp k 1 y k 2 y note all other components in eq 12 13 are equal including the parameterization of cdf fy by v which does not include q the equivalence of y of eq 12 14 applies only to one site s with homogeneous seismicity in its surrounding we introduce now an expansion of this equivalence to the influence function y this function describes the influence of any fixed source point t to the seismic hazard of all sites s with homogenized site conditions 1 2 tsxxxsxsxsx x s eeyee ddvgyvgyeyffy e 14 this integral is basically equivalent to the integral of eq 12 and the principle of area equivalence also applies area equivalent gmrs result in equal influence functions therein homogeneity of seismicity is not required for eq 14 fe and can be source point specific time dependence is also possible what is the consequence for an actual and area equivalent gmr is gactual x gequivalent x for almost all x what includes a local bias an example is given in fig 3 b but q gactual x gequivalent x of eq 7 is not an actual random component and is not considered in eq 12 14 if q resp q are interpreted as an actual random component and the estimated residual variance from the regression analysis for the gmr is directly applied to the gmr in psha then we overestimate the entire random component residual resp and the variances v y s and by this the influence function y resp the entire influence of each source point t on the aefs y of all sites the hazard estimation of all sites is systematically over estimated in this way this does not exclude the possibility of local underestimation of y according to fig 3 b the only exception of the systematic overestimation is the case if all random components q 0 and e have no influence s above non mathematicians can numerically check these results beside this we state that gmrs could be random functions because there is no proof that all events need to have equal parameters in eq 2 5 submitted minor revision 13 4 2 a model of anisotropic gmr for a point source an anisotropic gmr can be simply formulated for a point source model according to the intercept theory fig 3 a by a unit isoline which includes area equal to the unit circle of angle functions the radius function dunit determines the unit isoline with azimuth of local polar coordinates with origin t the distance d in r 2 h 2 d 2 is replaced by d d dunit an example is pictured in fig 3 b different unit isolines can obviously be combined by the sum d 2 unit iai d 2 i unit with weighting 0 ai 1 and iai 1 we do not discuss any physical interpretation because our focus is on statistical modeling and physics is also not discussed in other anisotropic models enescu and enescu 2007 s rensen et al 2010 a a ba b t geo space b fig 3 construction of anisotropic gmr by an unit

underestimation a and b for fig 4 a 4 3 examples of area equivalent gmrs we illustrate the action of misinterpretation of q as an actual random component in example i we apply the unit isoline of fig 3 b and we set 3 1 and 2 0 of a gmr according to eq 5 s fig 4 a the parameters are 0 1 s 0 because they are not relevant here furthermore we fix h 10 km and simulate for a fixed site in the center of a source region with homogeneous seismicity as described in appendix a 3 there is no actual random component in the actual gmr because v 0 we have plotted ln y in relation to distance r in fig 4 b with the regression function for the isotropic circular gmr the estimated parameters are almost equal to the actuals if the observed residuals are interpreted as actual random components then the residual variance is overestimated with v 0 10 an interesting aspect constitutes the distance dependency of q in fig 2 b it increases with increasing distance but we can also construct an example ii of area equivalence with decreasing variance using the joyner boore distance in fig 4 c an actual and an estimated vertical projection of the rupture is pictured the shape of both projections and the included area is equal only the azimuth is different obviously the actual and the modeled joyner boore distance are area equivalent for the same gmr but there is a component q resp q we simulate again

numerically investigate the influence of the type of cdf fy which is determined by the distribution of resp on the hazard curve for equivalent residual variance for this purpose we use again the constructed situation of seismicity according to appendix a 3 with fixed depth h 10 km and consider different upper magnitudes mmax 7 and 9 additionally we consider different variances v 0 152 and 0 32 for log 10 which are typical for previous gmrs the applied gmr is g x 0 5 m ln r 0 002 r 4 7 we consider different distributions of random component gumbel the log normal and truncated log normal submitted minor revision 15 distribution the latter has an upper and lower bound at three times its standard variation the computed aefs are shown in fig 5 we note that the influence of the distribution type depends on the maximum magnitude the residual variance and the range of y the hazard of rare events is largest for the log normal distribution with high variance of course further seismicity parameters influence the contribution of the distribution model and the distribution model has no influence in case of unbounded exponentially distributed magnitudes sec 4 1 5 2 an example of area equivalent gmrs in a psha we research the influence of the misinterpretation of q of example i sec 3 5 fig 3 b on the psha the gmr is g x 0 5 m ln r 4 7 the considered site s again is the centre of the quadratic source region of uniform seismicity with mmax 8 for further details see appendix a 3 we compute the aef for an isotropic circular gmr and the anisotropic one both without a random component resp residual in the third variant we consider the isotropic gmr and consider a normally distributed random component with v 0 10 according to the estimation of example i in sec 3 5

differences as random component results in the overestimated hazard 5 3 the obscuration of a gumbel distributed random component 0 the gumbel distribution of random component 0 eq 7 a could be hidden if we observe estimate the product 0 s s as unknown site effect acting as random variable according to joyner and boore 1993 then we cannot test the assumption of log normal distribution for each component but the product could be distributed similarly to a log normal distribution an example 0 is gumbel distributed with e 0 1 and v 0 0 199 s is beta distributed s eq a 3 with e s 1 and v s 0 091 and with bound 0 5 s 2 8 the submitted minor revision 16 product 0 s has a mixed distribution as shown in fig 7 a it looks very similar to a log normal distribution however their tails in fig 7 b differ considerably the tail is important for psha according to the studies of restrepo velez and bommer 2003 and strasser et al 2008 and it is a specially studied object in extreme value statistics leadbetter et al 1983 therein the tail of a distribution should be modeled by the generalized pareto distribution huyse et al 2010 has already modeled the tail for the residuals of a ground motion using a generalized pareto distribution furthermore we research in detail the possibility of hidden distributions for a gmr y 0 sexp 0 7 m ln r s 1 xs 1 s 2 xs 2 s 1 xs 2 with a site parameter exp s i

5 ln r ln 200 and an occurrence probability of 1 3 for each site type then we carry out a ls regression using this sample and analyze the estimated residuals to be normally distributed we have done this for a sample size of n 1500 the estimated residual variance is v 0 293 the q q normal plot of the residuals is shown in fig 7 c similar plots s bommer et al 2004 fig 2 have been interpreted as a

survival functions of a c q q plot 5 4 the influence of the different effects on the estimation of gmr and psha now we research the effects of the combination of misinterpreted random component q incorrect distribution assumption for fy and measurement errors in the predictors on the psha using examples of anisotropic gmrs with point sources for this purpose we assume again the constructed situation of a site s and surrounding homogeneous seismicity according to appendix a 3 the magnitude is upper bounded here by mmax 8 the seismicity parameters are precisely known for the psha but the parameters of the gmrs are estimated for the submitted minor revision 17 latter regression models are estimated for monte carlo simulated samples of y mmeasured rmeasured therein the actual hypocenter depth h is fixed and the accidental distance d to the point source is beta distributed the related parameter depends partly on the simulated beta distributed magnitude for details s sec a 3 the measurement errors of depth h and distance d are also monte carlo simulated hmeasured is a log normally distributed random variable the measured distance is erroractualmeasured ddd km with normally distributed derror with a standard deviation of 5 km and an expectation of 0 a seismological epicenter or point of maximum energy could be estimated more precisely but the seismological epicenter can differ from the epicenter of the gmr the point of maximum g x resp g x we also assume a normally distributed measurement error for the magnitude with a standard deviation of 0 15 and 0 25 this is plausible according to our discussion in sec 2 2 and the magnitude errors in the peer database 2013 nga flatfile 2005 version xls we simulate 500 pairs of mmeasured rmeasured for each sample using this procedure examples are illustrated in fig 8 these are conceivable possibilities according to actual samples e g ambraseys and simpson 1996 ambraseys et al 1996 spudich et al 1999 atkinson 2004 kalkan and g lkan 2004 massa et al 2008 the related ground motion intensity y s 0 g x is computed by the actual pair m r and the defined gmr it is formulated by g x and v 0 of eq 3 and is transformed to g x and v 0 by eq 4 its relevant parameters are listed in tab 2 the individual random component 0 is gumbel distributed eq 16 b the site specific random component s is beta distributed with expectation e s 1 with a small share to s tab 2 rows 9 and 10 anisotropy is considered by an elliptic unit isoline s sec 4 2 and fig a 3 b the actual random component residuals is not log normally distributed resp is not normally distributed we estimate a gmr with the ls regression for each sample of size n 500 and test the estimated residuals to be normally distributed using the ks test as done in previous researches we repeat this 100 times for each researched variant the averages of the estimated parameters are listed in tab 2 as well as the shares of rejection of the ks test the false normal assumption for is accepted in 68 to 98 of the samples the residual variances of all four variants are overestimated according to rows 10 and 11 in tab 2 therein the contribution of the magnitude error is small raw 15 we show the gmrs g x in fig 9 with actual parameters and with the averages of the estimated parameters they do not differ from each other very much but there is a certain bias furthermore we compute the aef by psha and for the assumed seismicity described above we compare the influence of the actual and the estimated gmrs we apply the averages of submitted minor revision 18 the estimations to the latter one the corresponding aefs for the constructed seismicity are depicted in fig 10 the actual aefs are shown for site condition e s 1 and the 80 quantile of s this gives an impression of the small influence of the considered site effects furthermore we show an aef for the area equivalent isotropic gmr with the actual type and variance of fy we state the area equivalence works well as expected the overestimated variance and the wrong log normal assumption lead to an overestimation of the hazard for long return periods reciprocal of exceedance frequency the bias in parameter vector partly compensates this overestimation the theoretical results of sec 4 1 are confirmed 0 50 100 150 200 250 3 4 5 6 7 8 o b se r v e d d is ta n c e r k m

6 1 the basic concept we have stated in sec 4 1 that the gmr of an earthquake is a random function in our model that means that the gmr has event specific parameters in consequence the parameters of the gmr can and should be estimated event specific therein we assume that it is practically impossible to find the true gmr being absolutely exact for each azimuth and with a perfect source model furthermore we assume that an event specific area equivalent gmr g x can be formulated and estimated by a regression model except the variances of the actual random components the relation of the event specific gmrs to the event magnitudes has to be researched in this concept after a number of gmrs have been estimated this approach has already been applied by joyner and boore 1981 they estimated the parameter 1 of eq 5 by a regression analysis of the pairs m 0 wherein 0 of our eq 5 is event specific event specific random component e resp e would be the residual variance of such secondary regression analysis the influence of site effects can be analyzed using a posterior analysis of the estimated residuals morikawa et al 2008 negligence of non iid thus event specific randomness of the site effects could be considered the remaining problem is to estimate v 0 resp v 0 under exclusion of any influence of q resp q this should be possible by an analysis of the two horizontal components y 1 and y 2 the difference 0 lnln lnln ln ln ln ln 020102010201 020121 e xgxgyy qseqse 15 includes only the horizontal random components 01 and 02 resp 01 and 02 therein 01 and 02 resp 01 and 02 have an equivalent distribution and they are interdependent if we would know the dependence structure between 01 and 02 according to mari and kotz 2001 submitted minor revision 20 sec 4 copula then we could estimate the distribution of 01 and 02 with the difference ln 01 ln 02 by statistical computations therefore the dependence structure should be investigated in future researches a differentiation by classes of magnitudes regions site conditions or something else is possible because there should be enough ground motion observations to compute a large number ln 01 ln 02 we cannot prove the functionality of our entire suggestion but we estimate the gmrs of different earthquakes to demonstrate the potential of our approach 6 2 analysis of empirical data we analyze the observed pgas of nine earthquakes of the peer strong motion database 2013 files nga flatfile 2005 version xls nga documentation xls we select such earthquakes with a large number of records and an event center inside the cloud of strong motion stations which should cover the entire event area event 136 differs slightly furthermore we consider only one event from a cluster try to consider different regions and to cover a relatively large range of the magnitude scale the selected earthquakes are listed in tab 3 we consider different models a point source model with isotropic gmr a point source model with anisotropic gmr and if available the source models which lead to the constructed joyner boore distance the campbell distance the root mean squared distance rmsd and the closest distance to the ruptured area clstd our basic formulation is g x 0 2 ln r 3 r according to eq 5 with r 2 d 2 h 2 resp r 2 d 2 d 2 unit h 2 for the anisotropic point source we use an eccentric circle and an ellipse fig a 3 to model anisotropy additionally we consider different combinations of defined and estimated parameters the depth parameter h can be set by the hypocenter depth or be estimated with limit h 0 1 km the parameter 3 for ln r is estimated or set to 1 we do not consider a bound the parameter 2 is either set to 0 or estimated with limit 2 0 we divide the models into groups the constructed distances the isotropic point source with epicenter as projected point source the isotropic point source with estimated coordinates of the point source start values are the epicenter coordinates and the anisotropic point source model with estimated coordinates of the point source for each division we select the variant of best combination of estimated set parameters by the smallest aic rawlings et al 1998 sec 7 with sample size n and parameter number n nnvaic 2 ln 16 the parameters of the best models are listed in tab a 4 their aics are given in tab 4 v in tab 5 the constructed distances do not result in good estimations the anisotropic point submitted minor revision 21 source model is frequently the best model this may be relative because constructed distances do not exist for each event but we consider four constructed distances and only two simple variants of anisotropy additionally it may be possible that we have estimated only a local minimum of least squares for the anisotropic models the global one could be much better the average variance of the best models of all point source models is v 0 19 this also includes the site effects but it is nevertheless significantly smaller than the residual variance of the intra event component of nga for example abrahamson and silva 2008 standard derivations s 1 and s 2 of tab 6 eq 27 have variances between 0 35 m 5 and 0 22 m 7 this fact indicates the advantage of our approach examples of the estimated gmrs are shown in fig 11 the graphs of the gmrs look partly very individual which is a result of event specific parameters this validates the approach of individual gmrs for individual earthquakes there are also some cases with estimated depth h 0 1 km our defined lower bound for h reason for such poor estimations is the non regular situation in the regression model a parameter h defines the predicting variable distance r smith 1985 has mathematically researched the problem of irregularity for distribution functions we do not know a similar research for regression models however this problem could be minimized by the bayesian approach of parameter estimation the seismological source estimation could provide a prior distribution for the depth parameter furthermore the estimations for event 136 the kocaeli turkey 1999 earthquake are poor the parameter 3 is 0 in some estimations

6 3 area functions and site effects of the chi chi earthquake the chi chi taiwan 1999 earthquake 137 is the one with the largest sample size n 420 we can use it to compare the area function of the estimated gmr to the actual one but we cannot compute the area function directly because the records are from stations that are not uniformly distributed there are concentrations and thinning that have to be considered we do it using an empirical area function wherein the integration of eq 9 is replaced by a discrete accumulation with 0 1 1 iii n i iiobserved yotherwiseyyifyyayk 111 and 17 0 1 1 x 1 x x 1 x 1 iii n i iigmr gotherwiseygifggayk 18 we estimate these discrete steps ai by a voronoi analysis of the stations and our estimated area functions are defined with indicator function s eq 9 the results are shown in fig 12 a good model should include a good accordance between eq 17 18 with larger differences for larger y because of a larger influence of the random components additionally a certain submitted minor revision 23 bias is conceivable for very small values of y because of the effect of the truncation of the geo space by the finite sample resp station number in eq 17 18 a good agreement is detected for the point source model with estimated coordinates especially the anisotropic variant fits well in contrary to the constructed distances the plausibility of the comparison of ykobserved and ykgmr can be simply tested by generation of x igy with the estimated gmr and monte carlo simulated random component we do it for anisotropic gmr for a point source and simulate 100 times the entire sample and adopted the weighting ai for ykobserved by factor 0 01 we consider a log normal and gamma distributed random component to demonstrate the generality of the

gray line log normally distributed bold dotted dark gray line gamma distributed thin black line eq 18 submitted minor revision 24 6 4 relation of specific gmrs to the magnitude there is the need to find a relation between the event specific gmrs and the earthquake magnitudes when the event size in the psha is quantified by the magnitude we search such a relation by a statistical analysis of the relations between the parameters of the gmrs and the magnitudes the results are shown in fig 13 a to d obviously there is not a significant relation but we follow the idea of the max stable random fields and compute the volume of gmrs in the geo space we compute the volume s sx dgvo 2 19 numerically for distance d resp d 1000 km in steps of 25 m therein we squared the event specific gmr because the pga is approximately proportional to the pgv wald et al 2006 section 2 5 eq 1 1 1 4 the squared velocity is proportional to the energy and the energy is strongly related to the magnitude the logarithms of these volumes have a strong statistical linear relation to the magnitude according to fig 13 e and f with a minor influence of v of course the applied sample size is small which causes an uncertainty of the result but the magnitudes and the volumes are also only estimated and include an estimation error such errors rather disturb the observed relation therefore the actual relation should be really strong the relation is also not changed significantly if we eliminate event 136 with the poor estimations such a relation could be applied to gmrs in a psha the distance parameters 2 and 3 in eq 5 could be random variables and 0 is computed using the relation magnitude to volume the previous magnitude parameter 1 would not be needed anymore a r 0 1677 0 10 20 30 40 4 5 6 7 8 9 p a

revision 25 7 conclusion and outlook we have discussed here important aspects of earlier approaches to gmr by a regression model and discovered in sec 2 that many models have not been built according to the rules of statistics regarding statistical significance model selection and test of the distribution assumption but even if the log normal assumption for residuals of are tested positively it is not because the individual component 0 according to eq 7 of a pga or another maximum value should be generalized extreme value distributed according to the extreme value statistics sec 3 5 its domain of attraction seems to be the gumbel one but this issue should be examined by future researches our major contribution is the introduction of area equivalence of gmr for psha in sec 4 which implies a distinction between an appropriate prediction of the pga for a concrete earthquake by a conventional regression model and an appropriate gmr for the psha these models need not to be equal regarding the residual variances in contrary the residual of the regression model for the random function gmr includes the component q of eq 4 this may not apply as an actual random component in the gmr for the psha otherwise the variance v is overestimated which leads to an overestimated hazard in the psha except for one case sec 4 1 the possible influence of the distribution of and the misinterpretation of q have been researched in sec 5 the overestimation of hazard can be remarkable our numerical studies consider a broader constellation of parameters and distribution of predictors than the numerical studies of joyner and boore 1993 and chen and tsai 2002 about estimation procedures for gmrs nevertheless the benefit is limited more extensive numerical studies with different sample sizes would be needed to quantify more exactly the bias in the psha independent of this fact we have suggested an estimation concept for gmrs in psha in the last section including the independent estimation of the parameters of the individual random component 0 we stated that the dependence structure of the horizontal components has to be researched in the future to apply this concept however we were able to show that the event specific modeling of gmr leads to smaller variances v than earlier models therein the anisotropic point source approach results in the best regression models while the constructed distances e g joyner boore do not work well the relation between the event magnitude and the gmrs is given by the integration of g 2 x over the geo space details of this relation and its consideration in psha should be studied in further researches beside this the empirical area functions for the chi chi taiwan 1999 earthquake confirm that the anisotropic point source approach works well nevertheless we also suggest developing a detailed theory of this geo statistical approach in the future this also applies to the estimation of point source submitted minor revision 26 coordinates and depth by a regression analysis further statistical methods like bayes estimation local regression or kernel regression could provide better estimations and the models of extreme value statistics for the distribution tails could improve the gmr in psha a large challenge for future researches is also the discovering estimation and or examination of the distribution of every single random component
