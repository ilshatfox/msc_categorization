93106 usa abstract abstract we present a phase space model that simulates pleistocene ice volume changes based on earth s orbital parameters terminations in the model are triggered by a combination of ice volume and orbital forcing and agree well with age estimates for late pleistocene terminations the average phase at which model terminations begin is approximately 90 90 before the maxima in all three orbital cycles the large variability in phase is likely caused by interactions between the three cycles and ice volume unlike previous ice volume models this model produces an orbitally driven increase in 100 kyr power during the mid pleistocene transition without any change in model parameters this supports the hypothesis that pleistocene variations in the 100 kyr power of glacial cycles could be caused at least in part by changes in earth s orbital parameters such as amplitude modulation of the 100 kyr eccentricity cycle rather than changes within the climate system keywords glacial cycles climate model orbital forcing mid pleistocene transition eccentricity 1 introduction numerous studies have demonstrated that pleistocene glacial cycles are linked to cyclic changes in earth s

2007 however many questions remain about how orbital cycles in insolation produce the observed climate response the most contentious problem is why late pleistocene climate records are dominated by 100 kyr cyclicity insolation changes are dominated by 41 kyr obliquity and 23 kyr precession cycles whereas the 100 kyr eccentricity cy cle produces negligible 100 kyr power in seasonal or mean annual insolation thus various studies have proposed that 100 kyr glacial cycles are a response to the eccentricity driven modulation of precession lisiecki 2010 b raymo 1997 bundling of obliquity cycles huybers and wunsch 2005 liu et al 2008 and or internal oscillations gildor and tziperman 2000 saltzman et al 1984 toggweiler 2008 a closely related problem is the question of why the dominant glacial cycle shifted from 41 kyr to 100 kyr during the mid pleistocene most com monly this mid pleistocene transition mpt is attributed either to a drop in atmospheric co 2 levels ho nisch et al 2009 paillard 1998 raymo 1997 or erosion of the continental regolith clark et al 2006 but other mecha nisms have also been proposed some hypotheses do not require any internal changes in the climate system attributing the shift to chaotic or irregu lar mode switching huybers 2009 saltzman and verbitsky 1993 or to a change in the character of insolation forcing lisiecki 2010 b for exam ple the 100 kyr power of the climate response is observed to be negatively correlated with the 100 kyr power of eccentricity for at least the last 3 myr lisiecki 2010 b meyers and hinnov 2010 many simple models have produced 100 kyr cycles as responses to preces sion and or obliquity using different nonlinear responses to orbital forcing early models had difficulty reproducing the large amplitude of marine iso tope stage mis 11 during weak orbital forcing and produced too much 400 kyr power e g imbrie and imbrie 1980 however newer multi state models have solved these particular problems paillard 1998 parrenin and paillard 2003 many models can also reproduce a transition from 41 kyr to 100 kyr cyclicity during the mid pleistocene transition by changing certain model parameters or climate boundary conditions ashkenazy and tziper man 2004 clark et al 2006 huybers 2007 paillard 1998 paillard and parrenin 2004 raymo 1997 in fact the wide variety of ways in which 100 kyr glacial cycles can be produced makes it difficult to determine which if any of the models correctly describes the source of 100 kyr glacial cyclicity tziperman et al 2006 we present a new phase space model of pleistocene ice volume that gen 2 erates 100 kyr cycles in the late pleistocene as a response to obliquity and precession forcing like parrenin and paillard 2003 we use a threshold for glacial terminations however ours is a phase space threshold a function of ice volume and its rate of change our model is the first to produce an orbitally driven increase in 100 kyr power during the mid pleistocene tran sition without any change in model parameters in section 2 we describe the model and the derivation of its parameters in section 3 we compare the model results and climate data for the last 3 myr with emphasis on the timing of 100 kyr glacial terminations and changes in spectral power in section 4 we discuss 1 parameterization of the relationships between ice volume and orbital forcing 2 the timing of terminations with respect to orbital forcing and 3 the mid pleistocene transition finally section 5 summarizes our conclusions 2 methods 2 1 overview we use a statistical analysis of the ice volume record to guide the devel opment of a set of evolution equations which accurately model the dynamics of glacial cycles this is an important shift in perspective in that we are not testing specific physical mechanisms that may be responsible for key fea tures of the record rather we hope that the form of the equations will help clarify the discussion of possible mechanisms assuming that ice volume is the slowest mode in the climate system we look for equations involving a single variable y and an orbital forcing term and then explain as much of the low frequency variation in the record as possible 2 2 variables development and parameterization of the model is guided by analysis of the lr 04 global stack of benthic 18 o lisiecki and raymo 2005 which is a proxy for global ice volume and deepwater temperature the lr 04 stack from 0 to 1500 ka is taken with a sign change as is conventional so that larger values correspond to warmer epochs smaller ice volume the stack is interpolated as needed to get a record sampled every thousand years as we are interested in the slowly varying aspects of the record we put the data through a gaussian notch filter centered at 0 with a bandwidth of 1 kyr 1 the result was standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the 3 standard deviation producing a function y t for the ice volume record over time scaled to run roughly from 2 to 2 combinations of orbital functions obliquity e sin precession and e cos phase shifted precession are used as a forcing for our model and are taken from laskar et al 2004 insolation at most latitudes and seasons can be represented quite accurately by a combination of these three orbital functions the variables were standardized based on the mean and standard deviation from 0 to 1500 ka with a thousand year sampling interval the resulting variables are denoted obl esi eco 2 3 phase space picture we examine the ice volume record in a 2 dimensional plot with y on the horizontal axis and y the time rate of change of y on the vertical axis positive values denote y 0 warming epochs colors denote the forcing function discussed below with red for large positive warming and blue for large negative cooling one thing that becomes clear from figure 1 is the special role that the large semicircular loops play in the ice volume dynamics these are traversed in a clockwise fashion and correspond to periods of rapid warming terminations terminations have long been recognized as key features of the ice volume record most of the time however the system remains fairly close to the horizontal axis moving gradually left and bobbing up and down as it adapts slowly to changes in forcing 2 4 threshold for terminations in figure 1 one can observe just above the horizontal axis that there is a transition zone where some loops head back to the axis and others head upwards to initiate a large loop evidently if the rate of warming is large enough the climate will shift into a termination mode with runaway melting the threshold appears to be a diagonal line extending roughly from 2 0 to 0 13 this leads us to define a transition line trans x min 135 07 x 135 1 plotted onto figure 1 which incorporates this diagonal line and extends it horizontally to the right of the vertical axis above the line we consider the system to be in termination state below it is in glaciating

the termination state see supplementary online video 5 and ice volume here the diagonal line represents a combination of y and y ice volume but insofar as y and insolation are correlated the concepts are similar 2 5 accumulation state the accumulation state is modeled with a first order differential equation y g y f y t 2 where g y describes the internal tendency of the ice sheets to grow or re treat and f y t describes the external forcing a first order equation is a natural starting point for a system responding to a variable heat source additionally the phase lag with respect to obliquity is characteristic of a first order equation as we will see there is significant variation in y of the sensitivity of ice volume to various components of orbital forcing this is the reason for allowing the forcing function to depend on y as well as t clues for what might be reasonable choices for g were obtained by a weighted regression analysis for the period 1500 0 ka a weighted least squares regression was performed for y with obl esi eco used as explanatory variables the following weights were used exp y t y 0 2 d 2 with d 45 in this way we were able to get an understanding of the contributions of the individual forcing functions to y furthermore we could learn how the contributions vary with ice volume y 0 by effectively restricting attention to data points with y near y 0 the linear model looks as follows y h 1 y 0 obl h 2 y 0 esi h 3 y 0 eco r 3 where h 1 h 2 h 3 are the regression coefficients and r is the residual the residual r t has considerable scatter but by averaging the values of r using a weight function as above we obtained an estimate for the internal evolution function g y 0 1 n t r t exp y t y 0 2 d 2 4 where n t exp y t y 0 2 d 2 5 in formulating the model we used these functions h 1 h 2 h 3 g as guide lines only giving ourselves the freedom to tweak the curves to improve the 6 out 73 2 1 0 1 2 y 0 02 0 04 0 06 0 08 0 10 0 12 2 1 0 1 2 y 10 20

2 y t esi t h 3 y t eco t 7 lastly we compare in figure 3 the original g y with the piecewise linear version used in our model note that there is a similarity in shape but the version used for the accumulation state is lower this is due to the fact that the original g y came from averaging all the data including the terminations which have large positive values of y when one restricts attention to data in the accumulation state a lower curve should be expected one can visualize the effect of the forcing f y t as moving this curve up and down although this picture is typical for some positive

leads to the conclusion that a first order equation is inadequate to describe the system above the black line in particular there is evidence of inertia i e a tendency for y to be consistent over successive time intervals therefore an accurate description of the time evolution requires a second order differential equation which can be visualized as a flow in phase space figure 1 shows that once above the line trans x the system moves in a roughly semicircular pattern until it returns to the vicinity of the horizontal axis approximately 12 000 years are required to traverse the semicircle the endpoint of the semicircle is variable but appears to correlate with the forcing f y t we define a semicircle destination function d y t by scaling f linearly d y t 1 3 f y t 28 51 8 the result tends to lie between 1 and 2 the warmer the forcing the further to the right the semicircle aims we find a differential equation which describes in phase space a semicircu lar flow with time dependent destination in figure 1 the vertical scale was expanded by a factor of 4 relative to the horizontal scale therefore if we let the vertical coordinate be y a with a 1 4 we should see semicircular flow the equation y a 2 y c describes circular flow with center c and period 8 cy db y a figure 4 deriving the differential equation for terminations 2 a which coincides with the desired 12 000 year semicircle traverse time in order to express c in terms of d y and y use some elementary geometry with figure 4 noting that b d y y a 2 and c d y b 2 we see that the equation can be written as y 1 2 a 2 d y y 2 d y 9 a discretized version of this equation is used to generate the flow of our model while it is in the termination state keep in mind that d d y t from equation 8 the system returns to the accumulation state as soon as y trans y in view of the time dependence of d it can happen that y overshoots d that is y d in this case y is set to 0 the discretized equation can run into problems when y is close to d due to the small denominator this is handled by replacing any negative y with 0 physically the underlying mechanism must be something which causes a continuation or even acceleration of melting once a threshold rate is passed under the right conditions isostatic depression can accentuate melting and some models predict a catastrophic disintegration of the ice sheet e g peltier and hyde 1987 additional instability may arise if components of the ice sheet are marine based see the discussion in denton et al 2010 9 2 7 behavior of the model due to the nature of threshold models it is important to note that the model can be very sensitive to changes in parameters or in its position in phase space the model can be close to the threshold for a termination and pushed over the edge or a termination can be lost if the model is pulled back from the threshold this is likely a feature of the real climate system as well there is also an increase in sensitivity due to the way the forcing is dependent on the ice volume y for example ice volume loss can be amplified if it causes an increase in the coefficient of a forcing function which happens to be positive or a decrease in the coefficient of a forcing function which happens to be negative one can get a general feel for the behavior of the model by observing that there are 40 kyr epochs where there is a termination with each obliquity cycle as well as 100 kyr epochs where the model skips some obliquity cycles when it fails to reach the threshold for terminations the idea of skipped obliquity cycles appears in huybers and wunsch 2005 skipped cycles tend to happen during times of low eccentricity since the combination of large precession and obliquity forcing will almost always push the model over the threshold lisiecki 2010 b indeed the largest terminations in our model occur soon after 400 kyr eccentricity minima see figure 5 at 430 ka and 2360 ka one of the important successes of our model is its accurate picture of stage 11 and termination v the model of parrenin and paillard 2003 also did well with this part of the record the model also exhibits an increased sensitivity to the external forcing when ice volume is large which means the system is primed to terminate after 80 to 100 kyr of accumulation the exact timing of the termination is determined by the forcing this leads to synchronization or phase locking with eccentricity cycles when the model is in the 100 kyr mode see tziper man et al 2006 for a discussion of this concept a notable success of our model is its ability to exhibit the mid pleistocene transition from 40 kyr to 100 kyr cycles without time dependent parameters the underlying mechanism is the decrease in the average eccentricity level about 900 000 years ago one can see a confirmation that average eccentricity level is driving the switches between 40 kyr and 100 kyr mode by looking at the period of low eccentricity around 2500 ka which results in an increase in 100 kyr power in our model output in agreement with the ice volume record see figure 5 which shows the behavior of the model over the last 3000 kyr 10 o ut 4 6

de pending on the amount of damping imagine swinging a ball on a string the actual phase lag between typical insolation curves and the oxygen iso tope record is close to or a bit less than 90 which is typical of a first order equation while our model is second order and has a propensity to oscillate when driven it is first order during the accumulation state which is most of the time furthermore the timing of terminations is determined in the accumulation state this enables us to maintain a good phase relationship between forcing and model output our model is not equipped to handle the decrease in amplitude that be comes apparent when the data is viewed back to 3000 ka nevertheless there is a fair amount of similarity in features for both the model and the data the 100 kyr cycles are most pronounced soon after the eccentricity minima at 2900 2400 and 2100 ka although the correspondence is imperfect 3 results 3 1 model data comparison for 1 5 0 ma model results are compared to a detrended version of the lr 04 18 o stack from 3 0 ma figure 5 long term trends in the mean and variance of the stack are removed because the model includes no provisions to simulate these changes the stack is detrended first by subtracting a best fit fifth order poly nomial for 5 3 0 ma and then multiplying by e 0 34 t where t is time in ma to remove the stack s exponential trend in variance lisiecki and raymo 2007 note the stack does not provide definitive information about the ages of ice volume change because its age model is orbitally tuned however stack s tuned age model agrees within error with an untuned constant sedimentation rate age model lisiecki 2010 b and with radiometric age estimates of sea level change thompson and goldstein 2006 and magnetic reversals e g cande and kent 1995 additionally the tuned age model assumes some variability in the phase of climate response 1 a linear increase in response time from 3 1 5 ma and 2 short term phase changes at times when strict tuning would require large deviations in global mean sedimentation rates lisiecki and raymo 2005 the model reproduces many features of the detrended stack from 1 5 0 ma figure 6 especially the

vertical lines other model terminations are marked with dotted lines the last 1 myr the model also reproduces a shift from 41 kyr cycles to 100 kyr cycles at approximately 1 ma however the change in 100 kyr power is not as dramatic in the model as the proxy data in the model power in the 100 kyr band 78 8 128 0 kyr increases from 17 of the response before 1 ma to 29 after whereas 100 kyr power in the data increase from 8 to 48 of the response figure 7 the most notable model data misfits in the last 1 5 myr occur during mis 5 c at 100 ka mis 13 at 500 ka which has also been problematic in other models paillard 1998 parrenin and paillard 2003 mis 35 at 1175 ka and mis 47 at 1440 ka interestingly a much better match for mis 47 is obtained if the model is started with a value of 0 at 1 5 ma the model also generates five extra terminations in the last 600 ka dotted vertical lines in figure 6 however three of the five extra terminations have small amplitudes and well match the observed climate response the other two during mis 5 and 13 actually self correct the model after it over estimates mid interglacial ice growth in fact recent sea level estimates suggest that ice volume may have been smaller during mis 5 a than mis 5 c dorale et al 2010 therefore some of the apparent misfit between model and during mis 5 may be caused by the temperature component of the 18 o stack 3 2 phases of

although cycle for cycle agreement between the model and data is weaker before 1 5 ma figure 5 the model reproduces important spectral charac teristics of the data for the last 3 myr both model and data are dominated by 41 kyr power with very little 23 kyr and 100 kyr power from 2 1 ma and both have considerably more 100 kyr power after 1 ma figure 7 although 15 the model has a smaller increase in 100 kyr power than the data it achieves this without any change in model parameters the different model results for the two time intervals are solely the result of differences in orbital forcing

and raymo 2007 power in the 100 kyr band 78 8 128 0 kyr of model and data are in good agreement for the entire 3 myr and are both negatively correlated with the 100 kyr power of eccentricity this

pleistocene and during a peak in 100 kyr response from 3 0 2 5 ma both of these time intervals correspond to minima in the 100 kyr power of eccentricity 4 discussion 4 1 model parameters our model uses orbital forcing which is a linear combination of obliq uity e sin precession and e cos phase shifted precession the choice of which linear combination to use is data driven in that a regression analysis is used to determine which combination best explains y the rate of change in ice volume in our view this is preferable to working with a preconceived notion of which latitude and season is the most suitable for use in the forcing function in addition by using weighted regressions we allow the coefficients in the linear combination to depend on the ice volume y figure 2 shows that the weightings of the components of the forcing do vary significantly with ice volume we find that precession is more important during glacial epochs and obliquity is more important during interglacials see figure 2 left as the northern hemisphere ice margin moves southward so does the latitude of the insolation curve whose obliquity and precession components match our models forcing function this fits with the idea that the amount of melting in the most southerly parts of the ice sheets should be the primary driver of 16 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 2 0 2 time ka 41 k po w er a 500 1000 1500

right show in phase responses 18 ice volume changes the phase of the precession forcing is also of interest while the standard midsummer precession curve works well in interglacials we find that as the ice volume grows the relevant season for precession forc ing moves 1 2 months towards spring see figure 2 right this fits with the idea that as ice sheets extend further south the solar intensity necessary for significant melting will be attained earlier in the spring we have also used a data driven approach to determine the approximate shape of the internal evolution function drift function g y this function specifies the forcing independent part of the rate of change in ice volume in the accumulation state it is significant that g has an s shape see fig ure 3 so that horizontal lines intersect the curve in either 1 2 or 3 points each horizontal line equates to a particular level of orbital forcing ris ing intercepts correspond to unstable fixed points and descending intercepts correspond to stable fixed points thus for some values of the forcing both glacial and interglacial states are stable for higher values of the forcing only the interglacial state is stable and for lower values only the glacial is stable our model s drift function lies mostly below the axis which means that on average the ice volume grows until it reaches the threshold for ter minations this scenario with either one or two stable equilibria depending on insolation forcing is firmly rooted in the physics of ice sheets weertman 1976 other authors have used cubic nonlinearities like this in climate mod els including saltzman and verbitsky 1993 ditlevsen 2009 has made use of s shaped drift functions to reinterpret and extend paillard s 3 state model paillard 1998 from the point of view of bifurcation theory it is worth comparing the shape of g assuming zero focing as in figure 3 with that of the corresponding function in imbrie and imbrie 1980 which used straight lines with corresponding to time constants of 10 6 kyr warming and 42 5 kyr cooling if one replaces the portion of the graph in figure 3 below the axis with a straight line to the point 2 07 one obtains equivalent time constants of 12 kyr warming and 58 5 kyr cooling while individual terminations can be sensitive to small changes in pa rameters the overall pattern of 100 kyr cycles at times of low eccentricity is stable to small changes in parameters we would expect something similar if the model were subjected to stochastic forcing this would be interesting to pursue further however it is worth noting that a deterministic model can explain many of the key features of the climate record larger changes in parameters can make the system either more or less likely to produce 100 kyr cycles but it is important to note that our model 19 is realistic in the sense that parameters were chosen close to those determined from the statistical analysis see figures 2 and 3 4 2 termination phases the phase of termination onset with respect to orbital forcing has been shown to vary when the forcing is not perfectly periodic tziperman et al 2006 and when the trigger for termination onset depends on both ice volume and forcing parrenin and paillard 2003 the results of our model suggest that the range of termination phases produced by the climate system could be approximately 180 twice as large as range described by tziperman et al 2006 therefore early terminations may be consistent with milankovitch forcing as long as they occur after the minimum in insolation forcing these findings support the interpretation of kawamura et al 2007 that the onset of abrupt antarctic warming is consistent with northern hemisphere forcing during each of the last four terminations despite their wide range in phase phase stability with respect to different orbital parameters can be quan tified by rayleigh s r statistic defined as r 1 n n i 0 cos n i sin n 10 where n is the phase lag of the nth 100 kyr window relative to eccentricity and the line brackets indicate the magnitude r has a maximum value of 1 0 when all cycles have the same phase lag for terminations 1 11 in the model and data termination phases have a slightly tighter clustering with respect to precession than obliquity or eccentricity figure 8 the precession r values of the model and tuned data are 0 82 and 0 93 respectively whereas the obliquity r values are 0 69 and 0 72 it is unclear whether this is a real feature of climate dynamics or an artifact of age model tuning because the phase at which terminations occur in the tuned data will affect the climate s apparent sensitivity to obliquity and precession forcing and therefore the parameterization of the model the precession phase of terminations in the untuned stack lisiecki 2010 b is slightly less clustered than for eccentricity and obliquity but this could easily be an age model artifact caused by the greater impact of age model uncertainty on the phase of a shorter cycle huybers and wunsch 2005 20 4 3 mid pleistocene transition based on the anticorrelation between 100 kyr power in eccentricity and the lr 04 18 o stack lisiecki 2010 b proposed that the internal climate feed backs responsible for plio pleistocene 100 kyr cycles are inhibited by strong precession forcing our model demonstrates that relatively simple responses to orbital forcing can reproduce the observed anticorrelation between the 100 kyr power of eccentricity and ice volume the 100 kyr cycle in the presence of weak eccentricity and thus weak precession occurs because the model is biased toward ice volume growth between terminations and because the sensitivity to precession increases as ice volume increases thus after 90 kyr of ice sheet growth ice volume is large enough that the combined influ ence of obliquity and relatively weak precession will trigger a termination in contrast during strong 100 kyr eccentricity cycles the combined obliquity and precession forcing is strong enough to trigger terminations approximately every 41 kyr as observed 1 5 1 ma and 600 450 ka additionally positive and negative interference between precession and obliquity might contribute to changes in the 100 kyr power of the model through time before 1 ma the timing of individual 100 kyr cycles in the model does not correspond particularly well with 100 kyr cycles in the data the model also produces slightly too much 100 kyr power at 2 0 and 1 5 ma and not enough at 500 ka it is possible that a different parameterization or a more sophisticated model might alleviate these discrepancies however the model is not capable of producing the trend and the reduction in amplitude that one sees in the data prior to 1 ma a more complete understanding of climate dynamics prior to 1 5 ma is likely to require a model incorporating gradual changes in climate dynamics nevertheless our model demonstrates a mechanism by which 100 kyr power in eccentricity could be anticorrelated with the climate response additionally it supports the hypothesis that the timing of the mpt is related to changes in eccentricity forcing and suggests that if any changes in climate dynamics or boundary conditions are associated with the mpt they may be relatively subtle and or gradual for example no significant trend in co 2 concentrations across the mpt is suggested by most paleoclimate records lisiecki 2010 a 5 conclusions a pair of evolution equations describe how climate responds to orbital forcing a threshold in phase space determines which equation applies at any 21 given time when a combination of ice volume and its melting rate is not too large the system is in an accumulation state that evolves according to a first order differential equation the system responds linearly to orbital forcing and is subject to a nonlinear drift term having an s shape the drift term leads to either one or two stable values for ice volume depending on the level of orbital forcing above the threshold the system is in a runaway melting or termination state that evolves according to a second order equation in phase space the system moves along a semicircular arc toward a forcing dependent destination with low ice volume at which point it returns to the accumulation state our model uses a flexible forcing function that allows the strength of obliquity and precession forcing and the precession phase to vary with ice volume the form of the forcing function is guided by statistical analysis of correlations between each orbital function and the rate of change of ice volume the model reproduces many of the features of the ice volume record that have been challenging to understand the model has a 100 kyr mode where climate stays in the accumulation state through one or more insolation peaks before reaching the termination threshold this mode tends to be disrupted by high eccentricity values which lead to larger insolation peaks and prema ture crossing of the termination threshold conversely an extended period of low eccentricity such as the cycle prior to stage 11 allows for an extended time in the accumulation state before the threshold is crossed and this will lead to a larger 100 kyr cycle thus the model provides an explanation for the observed anticorrelation between eccentricity and the 100 kyr component of climate lisiecki 2010 b model output matches up well with many features of the lr 04 18 o stack from 1 5 0 ma especially the ages and amplitudes of glacial terminations of the last 1 myr broad features of the power in the 100 kyr band match up with the data from 3 0 ma in particular the pulses of 100 kyr power at 400 kyr eccentricity minima and the periods of more intense 100 kyr power coinciding with broad low eccentricity epochs at 5 and 2 5 ma the 2 myr eccentricity cycle model output switches from 40 kyr mode to 100 kyr mode at about 1 ma thereby reproducing the increase in 100 kyr power during the mid pleistocene transition without any change in model parameters this supports the hypothesis that pleistocene variations in the 100 kyr power of glacial cycles could be caused at least in part by changes in earth s orbital parameters such as amplitude modulation of the 100 kyr eccentricity cycle 22 references ashkenazy y tziperman e 2004 are the 41 kyr glacial oscillations a linear response
