in response to fluid injection robert c viesca 1 1 department of civil and environmental engineering tufts university medford ma 02155 usa received 31 may 2021 revised 7 sept 2021 published 12 oct 2021 there is scientific and industrial interest in understanding how geologic faults respond to transient sources of fluid natural and artificial sources can elevate pore fluid pressure on the fault frictional interface which may induce slip we consider a simple boundary value problem to provide an elementary model of the physical process and to provide a benchmark for numerical solution procedures we examine the slip of a fault that is an interface of two elastic half spaces injection is modeled as a line source at constant pressure and fluid pressure is assumed to diffuse along the interface the resulting problem is an integro differential equation governing fault slip which has a single dimensionless parameter the expansion of slip is self similar and the rupture front propagates at a factor of the diffusive lengthscale uc we identify two asymptotic regimes corresponding to being small or large and perform a perturbation expansion in each limit for large in the regime of a so called critically stressed fault a boundary layer emerges on the diffusive lengthscale which lags far behind the rupture front we demonstrate higher order matched asymptotics for the integro differential equation and in doing so we derive a multipole expansion to capture successive orders of influence on the outer problem for fault slip for a driving force that is small relative to the crack dimensions asymptotic expansions are compared to accurate numerical solutions to the full problem which are tabulated to high precision 1 introduction the coupling of fluid flow and fracture of an elastic medium has an extensive history in the context of open mode fractures specifically hydraulic fracture in which an injected fluid drives crack opening early work presumed laminar flow of the fluid in a planar crack khristianovic and zheltov 1955 barenblatt 1956 leading to similarity solutions and crack tip asymptotics spence and sharp 1985 desroches et al 1994 that depart from the square root asymptotic behavior of classical linear elastic fracture mechanics further developments include explicit consideration of fluid leak off into the elastic medium lenoach 1995 adachi and

03123 v 4 2 comparable problem of fluid driven delamination of a thin elastic sheet from a rigid substrate in this problem the sheet s elastic response is represented by classical beam theory such that elastic interactions are local and solutions are found in a relatively straightforward manner in comparison hydraulic fracture in a full space in which elastic interactions are non local reduces to singular integro differential equations requiring more specialized solution techniques a peculiarity of the thin sheet problem is that the inherent neglect of variations over distances on the order of the sheet thickness necessitates regularization of fluid flow near the fracture tip flitton and king 2004 this regularization may either take the form of a fluid lag behind the tip hewitt et al 2015 ball and neufeld 2018 wang and detournay 2018 or a pre existing thin film of fluid such that a rupture front is no longer precisely defined flitton and king 2004 hosoi and mahadevan 2004 lister et al 2013 hewitt et al 2015 peng and lister 2020 or may be bypassed altogether by explicit consideration of near tip phenomena over distances comparable to the sheet thickness lister et al 2019 we now look to examine the shear fracture counterpart to the above problems in the context of fluid induced slip of geologic faults the thin sheet limit of which is of interest in the modeling of landslides palmer and rice 1973 puzrin and germanovich 2005 viesca and rice 2012 snow slab avalanches mcclung 1979 and short timescale ice sheet motion lipovsky and dunham 2017 among other problems a source of fluid in the subsurface can drive the sliding mode fracture of a geologic fault by locally reducing the fault s frictional shear strength below an ambient level of shear stress such that fault must slide the fluid source may be natural such as from mineral dehydration of subducted sediments peacock 2001 or from a mantle source kennedy et al 1997 or artificial such as from the subsurface injection of fluids at kilometer scale depths for the disposal of wastewater healy et al 1968 or for the enhancement of permeability in geothermal oil or gas reservoirs despite wide interest simple solutions for fluid induced fault slip are scarce in the context of frictional fracture much of the development of fluid fracture interaction has focused on geologic fault phenomena including earthquakes and slow aseismic slip fluid driven fault slip has been studied in the context of earthquake nucleation via the initiation of aseismic slip viesca and rice 2012 garagash and germanovich 2012 jha and juanes 2014 ciardo and lecampion 2019 zhu et al 2020 garagash 2021 or strictly stable aseismic slip rutqvist et al 2007 garipov et al 2016 bhattacharya and viesca 2019 dublanchet 2019 yang and dunham 2021 in addition there has been substantial focus on fluid involved feedback mechanisms during seismic or aseismic fault rupture in which the role of fluids is in response to sliding such that rupture is fluid assisted or fluid inhibited these including dilatancy rice 1973 yang and dunham 2021 brantut 2021 thermal pressurization by frictional heating rice 2006 noda et al 2009 schmitt et al 2011 garagash 2012 viesca and garagash 2015 and chemical decomposition platt et al 2015 within this body of work solutions are nearly entirely numerical we examine a model for fluid driven fault rupture in which the condition of fluid flow is rudimentary but physically plausible and comparable to the starting assumption of laminar flow in hydraulic fracture we consider a planar fault in an unbounded linear elastic medium under a uniform state of stress prior to injection quasi static deformation is in plane or anti plane such that the corresponding fault slip is mode ii or mode iii rupture we use a boundary integral formulation to relate the crack face displacement and traction injection is modeled as a line source of fluids at constant pressure following which fluid migration and the concomitant rise in pore fluid pressure is restricted to occur along the fault plane the fault strength is frictional and is the product of a constant coefficient of friction and the local 3 effective normal stress the difference between the fault normal traction and the local pore fluid pressure this problem was presented in bhattacharya and viesca 2019 and is a variation of one considered in depth by garagash and germanovich 2012 hereafter referred to as gg 12 gg 12 examined the response to injection of a fault under the same elastic and fluid conditions considered here however gg 12 considered a fault friction coefficient that weakens with slip a feature that gives rise to rich behavior including the possibility of dynamic rupture nucleation and arrest corresponding to an earthquake source gg 12 found two end member regimes corresponding to marginally pressurized and critically stressed faults which reflect the pre injection state of stress the authors showed that these regimes lead to a rupture front lagging or outpacing fluid diffusion respectively and that in the critically stressed regime fault slip can be described by a boundary layer analysis however the slip dependent strength in that problem required numerical solution even in end member regimes and growth of the slipping region was non trivial and dependent on at least two problem parameters a constant coulomb friction coefficient necessitates stable growth of fault rupture furthermore the propagation of fault slip occurs in self similar manner in response to a self similar source additionally the problem has a single dimensionless parameter with the same two end member regimes as in the problem considered by gg 12 the simpler problem admits closed form perturbation expansions in these regimes and readily allows for higher order asymptotic matching of the boundary layer problem in the critically stressed regime in this regime where the rupture front races ahead of the elevated fluid pressure distribution the problem provides for the development of a multipole expansion to consider the higher order source effects the problem is also amenable to accurate numerical solutions for the cases intervening the two end member regimes and we provide tabulated solutions to high precision we begin in sections 2 and 3 by providing a problem statement and summary of asymptotic solutions to leading order in the critically stressed and marginally pressurized limits subsequently we return to the full problem and summarize its solution in section 4 finally we revisit the end member regimes and derive the asymptotic solutions to second order in the marginally pressurized limit the solution can be written as a single perturbation expansion section 5 in the critically stressed limit inner and outer perturbation expansions are found and the two solutions are matched to construct a composite solution sections 6 8 we compare the asymptotic expansions to numerical solutions to the full problem throughout 2 problem formulation 2 1 fluid mechanics a planar fault slip surface along h 0 is modeled as an interface within a poroelastic layer of thickness that is itself embedded within an elastic body the layer corresponds to a fault core that is presumed to be much more permeable than the surrounding host rock but having comparable elastic properties we assume that fluid flow within the layer follows darcy s law and we examine the injection of fluid directly into the fault core as a source of constant pressure distributed across the layer thickness at g 0 for this poroelastic configuration which is an in plane version of an axisymmetric case considered by marck et al 2015 the pore fluid pressure distribution is uniform across the layer thickness and its distribution g c along the fault coordinate g satisfies a diffusion equation c u h gg 4 10 10 10 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 0 2 4 6 8 1 0 2 4 6 8 1

5 compressibility of the fluid and porous matrix as noted by marck et al 2015 when the diffusive distance uc is much larger than the layer thickness the local response of the poroelastic layer is effectively that of uniaxial vertical strain in proportion to the local pore fluid pressure 2 2 solid mechanics we assume that the poroelastic layer thickness is small such that the condition uc is quickly achieved in the case the presence of the layer apart from its role in conducting fluids need not be explicitly considered and the shear and normal traction conditions on the layer medium boundary may be directly applied to the sliding interface furthermore provided uc is sufficiently greater than we may reasonably neglect any fault normal stress changes due to the swelling of the poroelastic layer about the source marck et al 2015 the medium containing the fault is assumed to be linearly elastic and its deformation along with slip on the fault may be in plane or anti plane the in plane case is illustrated in fig 1 top left the shear modulus of the medium is and the poisson ratio a we define the effective elastic modulus 2 1 a for in plane mode ii case and 2 for anti plane

bounded between 0 and 1 the upper bound denotes a marginally pressurized fault where the fluid pressure increase is just sufficient to initiate sliding 5 f g the lower bound denotes a critically stressed fault where the initial shear stress is equal to the initial shear strength g g the solution consists of a self similar distribution of slip in which the crack front grows as 0 c uc and the

the critically stressed and marginally pressurized limits in fig 8 for comparison we also show the full solution as well as the ad hoc approximation 3 11 constructed using the first order asymptotics

large value of 5 the composite solution has an approximate error of o 2 where 2 or 4 is the order neglected in the asymptotic expansion 9 summary and conclusion the quasi static rupture of a fault driven by a source of fluids has been studied in detail tracking the rupture of the fault corresponds to a free boundary problem for which both the size of the slipping domain and the distribution of slip within must be solved both depend on a single dimensionless parameter whose limits correspond either to a fault whose initial pre injection shear stress is relatively close to the fault s pre injection shear strength or to a fluid pressure increase that is marginally sufficient to induce sliding because the problem involves contact between elastic half spaces interactions between points on the fault are non local in that slip in one location induces changes in the shear stress over the entire fault plane the resulting equation governing slip evolution is an integro differential equation in addition to the crack tip boundary condition that slip vanish at the rupture front the condition determining the free boundary is the absence of a stress singularity ahead of the rupture front which corresponds to the boundary condition that the gradient of slip also vanishes at the rupture front moreover because the friction coefficient is held constant there is an absence of an elasto frictional lengthscale that may be otherwise present in problems for which friction depend explicitly on slip or its history correspondingly the only lengthscale in the problem is the diffusive length uc with the consequence that spatial dependence of slip scales directly with this lengthscale implying the self similar propagation of slip in a fashion similar to the earthquake nucleation problem considered by gg 12 we present asymptotic perturbation expansion solutions in the marginally pressurized and critically stressed limits and tabulate numerical solution for the intervening cases in the critically stressed limit the problem has both an inner solution on the scale of diffusion and an outer solution on the scale of the crack front an advantage of the posed problem is that the marginally pressurized expansion and the outer solution of the critically stressed limit are expressible in concise closed form for the latter we develop a multipole expansion method to develop successive approximations of a distributed loading beyond a point force approximation the leading order term of the inner solution of the critically stressed limit is solved numerically and tabulated key findings include that the rupture run out distance from the point of injection follows 0 c uc where is an amplification factor originally solved for and presented by bhattacharya and viesca 2019

1 has the form of a finite hilbert transform 6 g 1 c 1 1 b g b 3 b a 1 where here 6 g corresponds to a prescribed loading and of the distribution slip on the interface that is in quasi static equilibrium with the loading the solution to eq a 1 is the known inversion e g mushkhelishvili 1958 king 2009 g 1 g 2 1 1 g 2 1 c 1 1 1 b 26 b g b 3 b 1 c 1 1 b 3 b a 2 since slip vanishes at the rupture boundaries the corresponding condition on is 1 0 and hence 0 as an example solution consider the distribution 6 g x g which is equivalent to a distribution of a point force at the origin in the corresponding crack problem the inversion for g is g 1 1 g 2 1 c 1 1 1 b 2 x b g b 3 b 1 c 1 g 1 g 2 a 3 and integrating again with respect to g with the condition 1 0 we find that g 1 c arctanh 1 g 2 a 4 in table 1 we present a number of similarly derived solutions from which we draw in the main text from eq a 2 we find that g has the behavior in the limit g 1 g 1 2 1 g 1 c 1 1 1 b 1 b 6 b 3 b a 5 we may compare this behavior to the leading order term in the williams 1957 solution for slip near the tip of a crack located at g 0 x g 2 0 g c 3 x 3 g 1 2 0 g a 6 where is the conventionally defined mode ii or mode iii stress intensity factor and the corresponding leading order term in the distribution of stress ahead of the tip is gc 8 g 2 c g 0 we may define a quantity corresponding to the stress intensity factor by 0 and in comparing the latter expression in a 6 with eq a 5 we can derive an analogous expression for an intensity factor at g 1 1 c 1 1 1 b 1 b 6 b 3 b requiring that this intensity factor vanish at both tips hence implies that two conditions be 19 satisfied by the distribution 6 b 1 1 1 b 1 b 6 b 3 b 0 which can be recast as the sum and the difference of these two conditions leading respectively to 1 1 6 b 1 b 2 3 b 0 1 1 b 6 b 1 b 2 3 b 0 a 7 in the problem for the slip distribution eq 4 1 we identify 6 b erfc b 1 g g f a 8 the first condition of a 7 to be satisfied by a 8 corresponds to eq 4 2 in main text which provides the direct relation between and the problem parameter 1 g g f the second condition of a 7 is trivially satisfied by a 8 since 6 b is an even function for that case the non singular stress conditions a 7 if present can be taken into account in the inversion for g eq a 2 which may be rewritten as g 1 1 g 2 1 c 1 1 1 b 26 b g b 3 b 1 1 g 2 1 c 1 1 g b 6 b 1 b 2 3 b 1 g 2 c 1 1 1 1 b 2 6 b g b 3 b a 9 upon substituting eq a 8 in eq a 9 the contribution of the constant parameter 1 g g f vanishes and we retrieve eq 4 3 in the main text as another example we again consider the distribution 6 g x g for which the inversion for g with the non singular condition on g is g 1 g 2 c 1 1 1 1 b 2 x b g b 3 b 1 c 1 g 2 g 1 c 1 g 1 g 2 g 1 g 2 g 1 c arctanh 1 g 2 1 g 2 a 10 to which we may compare eq a 4 the inversion for the same distribution 6 g without the non singular condition in writing an asymptotic expansion for slip in powers in the marginally pressurized and critically stressed limits we derived spatial distributions for slip at each order x 0 and x 1 using results presented in table 1 note that the compilation of inversions in table 1 used a 2 and did not incorporate the non singular crack conditions a 7 in the inversion for g from 6 g however when solving for x 0 and x 1 the non singular conditions are implicitly incorporated in the expansion for the stress parameter 1 g g f in terms of the resulting expressions for x 0 and x 1 are fully equivalent to the solutions that would have been found had the conditions a 7 been incorporated directly into the inversion in other words we would have arrived to the same expressions for x 0 and x 1 in sections 5 and 6 had we instead used the non singular inversion a 10 to construct the functions g in table 1 and subsequently applied them to solve for x 0 and x 1 we recognize this for instance 20 in noting that the first term in the expansion for slip in the critically stressed limit eq 6 9 is given to within the factor 0 2 c by eq a 10 appendix b numerical solution procedure to numerically solve for the slip distribution x g from eq 4 3 given a value of we use gauss chebyshev quadrature for singular integrals erdogan et al 1973 viesca and garagash 2018 we begin by separating the singular integral in eq 4 3 q i 1 c 1 1 erfc b 1 b 2 1 i b 3 b b 1 and note that the slip distribution is given by the integration x g g 1 1 i 2 q i 3 i b 2 we numerically approximate the integral b 1 at a discrete set of points i 8 q i 8 1 9 1 erfc b 9 i 8 b 9 b 3 where the quadrature points b 9 and i 8 are i 8 cos c 8 8 1 1 b 4 b 9 cos c 9 1 2 9 1 we again use gauss chebyshev quadrature mason and handscomb 2002 to approximate the integral b 2 at a set of points g x g 1 1 8 1 1 i 28 q i 8 g i 8 b 5 where g b for 1 and is the heaviside step function we may similarly approximate the relation between 1 g g f and by first prescribing a value of and then numerically evaluating the integral 4 2 by gauss chebyshev quadrature 1 g g f 1 9 1 erfc b 9 b 6 where b 9 is defined as before appendix c multipole expansion here we derive the multipole expansion of eqs 6 3 6 6 this expansion was used to derive the outer solution in the critically stressed limit for which the rupture extent 0 c uc such that the fluid pressure source appears localized about the origin we begin by noting that the solution to the problem for g 6 g 1 c 1 1 b g b 3 b c 1 21 with the boundary conditions 1 1 0 may be also written in terms of the green s function g g satisfying x g g 1 c 1 1 b g g b 3 b using the inversion eq a 2 the green s function is g g 1 1 g 2 1 c 1 1 1 b 2 x b g g b 3 b c 2 1 c 1 g 2 1 g 2 1 g g and the solution to eq c 1 can be written as g 1 1 g g 6 g 3 g c 3 we derive a multipole expansion for eq c 1 by considering that a taylor series expansion of the green s function in eq c 3 about the origin g 0 g 1 1 g 0 g m mg g 0 g 2 2 m 2 mg 2 g 0 g m mg g 0 6 g 3 g reduces to g 0 g 0 1 m mg g 0 2 m 2 mg 2 g 0 m mg g 0 c 4 where the coefficients of this series are 0 1 1 6 g 3 g 1 1 1 g 6 g 3 g 2 1 1 g 2 2 6 g 3 g 1 1 g 6 g 3 g the expansion of 6 g implied by eq c 4 is found by first noting that from eq c 2 m mg 1 1 g 2 1 c 1 1 1 b 2 1 x b g g b 3 b c 5 where x is the th derivative of x with respect to its argument when evaluating eq c 5 at g 0 and comparing with eq a 2 we see that eq c 5 is the inverted solution for g when 6 g 1 x g hence substituting eq c 4 into eq c 1 yields 6 g 0 x g 1 x g 2 x g 1 x g where the leading two terms are the source monopole and dipole approximations respectively for 0 1 2 the first few functions of g in eq c 4 are g 0 1 c 1 g 1 g 2 m mg g 0 1 c 1 g 2 1 g 2 m 2 mg 2 g 0 g 2 2 g 3 1 g 2 multiplying these
