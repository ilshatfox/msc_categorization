these materials have potential applications such as scintillators thermophosphors photocatalyst and cathodoluminescene 1 in particular as photocatalysts they have attracted great attention for their applications in renewable energy and alternative green technology 2 they are also used as laser host materials when doped with trivalent rare earth cation due to their high optical conversion efficiency high birefringence and good thermal conductivity 3 4 at low temperature these materials show interesting structural and magnetic phase transformations 5 along with a few exhibiting jahn teller distortion 6 7 similar to the majority of rare earth orthovanadates rvo 4 r is rare earth element samarium vanadate smvo 4 crystallizes in tetragonal zircon type structure space group i 41 amd z 4 8 9 in this structure the vanadium atom is tetrahedrally coordinated while the samarium cation is coordinated by eight oxygen atoms forming triangular dodecahedra bidisphenoid the structure can be described in terms of alternating edge sharing smo 8 dodecahedra and vo 4 tetrahedra forming chains parallel to the c axis as shown in fig 1 upon compression these compounds undergo transformations to different denser phases depending on the size of the rare earth cation 10 typically the zircon type vanadates with small rare earth cations transform to the tetragonal scheelite type structure space group i 41 a z 4 around 6 8 gpa 11 12 it has been shown that the zircon and scheelite structures are closely and simply related via crystallographic twin operation 13 in particular starting with zircon and twinning on 200 020 and 002 generates the scheelite structure because of these symmetry relations the axial ratio of zircon c a 0 9 is approximately equal to 2 a c in scheelite i e c a 2 2 10 on the other hand in the compounds with larger rare earth cations la pr a different structural sequence has been reported these vanadates transform under quasi hydrostatic conditions to the monoclinic monazite type structure space group p 21 n z 4 at similar pressures 14 however when compressed non hydrostatically the zircon to scheelite transition is observed 15 both non hydrostatic stresses and the cationic radii have been shown to play similar role in the structural behavior of zircon type arsenates chromates and phosphates 16 17 raman spectroscopic measurements reported earlier in smvo 4 indicates zircon to scheelite transition at 6 5 gpa 18 however to the best of our knowledge smvo 4 has not yet been studied under compression either by in situ x ray diffraction xrd 3 or ab initio calculations these two techniques combined have shown to be a powerful tool to understand the high pressure behavior of ternary oxides 19 in addition to the high pressure structural behavior of smvo 4 another issue that deserves to be studied is the possible decomposition of rare earth orthovanadates under high pressure when studied with long wavelength x rays a phenomenon that has been reported to occur in hovo 4 and euvo 4 12 20 in the present article we report synchrotron based powder x ray diffraction study of smvo 4 using two different x ray energies and ab initio calculations up to the pressure of about 21 gpa evidence of zircon to scheelite phase transition is presented the structural details of the low and high pressure phases have been determined at various pressures furthermore the pressure dependence of unit cell parameters interatomic bond distances elastic constants and equations of state eos of different phases are obtained the reported results are discussed in comparison with related orthovanadates 2 experimental polycrystalline smvo 4 was synthesized by a conventional solid state reaction of stoichiometric amounts of pre dried sm 2 o 3 and v 2 o 5 details on sample preparation can be found elsewhere 21 the sample was characterized by powder xrd using a panalytical x pert pro diffractometer employing cu k 1 5418 radiation a single phase with zircon type structure was confirmed with unit cell parameters as a 7 2618 2 c 6 3837 3 and v 336 64 3 3 which agrees well with those reported in the literature 1 9 two series of experiments were performed at room temperature rt upon compression run 1 up to 21 4 gpa and run 2 up to 20 gpa the sample was loaded in 150 m diameter hole of stainless steel or inconel gaskets inside of a mao bell membrane type diamond anvil cell dac with a diamond culet of 400 m a mixture of methanol ethanol me in 4 1 ratio was employed as pressure transmitting medium ptm in run 1 whereas 16 3 1 methanol ethanol water mew mixture was used in run 2 high pressure angle dispersive powder xrd adxrd experiments were carried out at the xrd 1 beamline of elettra synchrotron source for run 1 and at the mspd beamline of the spanish alba synchrotron source 22 for run 2 at elettra monochromatic x rays of wavelength 0 653 were used with a beam size limited to 80 m in diameter by a circular collimator the eos of pt was used as in situ pressure scale 23 a mar 345 image plate area detector was used to collect xrd patterns for an exposure time of 15 20 minutes at each pressure at alba a monochromatic beam of wavelength 0 4246 was focused to a 15 m 15 m spot full width half maximum using kirkpatrick baez mirrors pressure was determined using cu as internal pressure gauge 23 4 diffraction images were collected using rayonix ccd detector with an exposure time of 10 30 seconds the fit 2 d software 24 was used to calibrate sample to detector distance detector tilt and to integrate the two dimensional diffraction images to standard one dimensional intensity vs two theta plot the structural analysis was performed with gsas software package 25 using a pseudo voigt profile function of thompson cox and hastings 26 the background of the xrd patterns was modeled with a chebyshev polynomial function 3 theoretical calculations ab initio total energy calculations were performed within the framework of density functional theory dft 27 using the plan wave method and pseudopotential theory with the vienna ab initio simulation package vasp 28 29 30 the projector augmented wave scheme 31 32 was employed in order to include the full nodal character of the all electron charge density in the core region basis sets including plane waves up to an energy cutoff of 520 ev were used to achieve highly converged results and an accurate description of the electronic properties the exchange correlation energy was considered in the generalized gradient approximation gga with the perdew burke ernzerhof exchange correlation prescription pbe 33 we also performed calculations with pbesol 34 however the results are very similar to the ones obtained with pbe a dense monkhorst pack grid of k special points was used to perform integrations along the brillouin zone bz in order to obtain very well converged energies and forces at each selected volume the structures were fully relaxed to their equilibrium configuration through the calculation of the forces on atoms and the stress tensor in the relaxed configurations the forces on the atoms were smaller than 0 006 ev and deviations of the stress tensor from a diagonal hydrostatic form are less than 0 1 gpa therefore our ab initio calculations provide a set of accurate energy volume and pressure e v p data that can be fitted using an equation of state eos in order to obtain the equilibrium volume v 0 bulk modulus b and its pressure derivate b calculations also provide the enthalpy of the different structures versus pressure which allows us to determine the stable structure and the transition pressure elastic constants describe the mechanical properties and mechanical stability of materials in the region where the stress strain relations are still linear the elastic constants were obtained by computing the macroscopic stress with the use of the stress theorem 35 the ground state and fully relaxed structures at several pressures were strained according to their symmetry the small total energy differences between the different strained states were 5 evaluated with high precision according to a taylor expansion 36 of the total energy with respect to the applied strain therefore it is important to check that the strain used in the calculations guarantees the harmonic behavior compound crystallizing in the zircon type structure belongs to the tetragonal laue group ti which has six independent elastic constants c 11 c 12 c 13 c 33 c 44 and c 66 on the other hand the scheelite type structure belongs to the tetragonal laue group tii and has seven elastic constants c 11 c 12 c 13 c 33 c 44 c 66 and c 16 to analyze the mechanical stability of crystals under external hydrostatic pressure p the generalized born stability criteria must be applied 37 for the ti laue group these criteria take the form for a crystal to be mechanically stable all the above criteria should be satisfied simultaneously for a crystal belonging to the scheelite type structure tii laue group the stability criteria m 1 to m 4 are the same as for ti however the m 5 criterion must be replaced by the m 6 criterion note that when no hydrostatic pressure is applied p 0 gpa the stability criteria m 1 to m 6 are known as born stability criteria 38 lattice dynamic calculations were performed at the zone center point of the bz with the direct force constant approach 39 the construction of the dynamical matrix implies separate calculations of the forces in which fixed displacements from the equilibrium configuration of the atoms within the primitive cell is considered highly converged results for forces are required for the calculation of the dynamical matrix diagonalization of the dynamical matrix provides the frequencies of the normal modes 6 4 results and discussion a selection of adxrd patterns collected at several pressures using me as ptm are shown in figs 2 a b a few data points measured while unloading pressure are also shown in fig 2 c in this set of data the ambient zircon phase is found to remain stable till 4 2 gpa the data collected at 4 8 gpa shows the appearance of new peaks indicting the onset of structural phase transition in the material on further compression a few more diffraction peaks appear as the phase fraction of the hp phase increases while the peaks from the zircon phase reduces in intensity as its fraction goes down the position of the strongest peak of the new structure matches well with that of the expected strongest peak of scheelite phase and indeed we could refine the new structure with a scheelite type structure at 10 gpa a pure scheelite phase could be observed which then remains stable up to 21 4 gpa the highest pressure reached in this experiment on decompression the scheelite phase is found to be metastable being possible to recover it at ambient pressure another interesting aspect observed in this study was the appearance of a peak at 2 value of 12 at 6 gpa this observation is similar to the one observed by us in other orthovanadates like hovo 4 and euvo 4 12 20 the position of the peak matched well with that of the strongest peak of v 2 o 5 and it could be followed up to the complete release of the pressure the presence of v 2 o 5 can be explained by a partial decomposition of the sample under the combined effect of compression and x ray energy in our earlier hp studies on hovo 4 and euvo 4 12 20 the appearance of the v 2 o 5 peaks have been observed when the x ray of wavelength close to 0 6 was employed in the measurements made on these compounds with smaller or larger wavelengths the decomposition was not observed also decomposition was not observed in raman experiments 18 these facts support the idea that partial decomposition could be triggered by x ray absorption which could induce photoelectric processes leading to the dissociation of v 2 o 5 units from the vanadates 40 in fig 3 a we show the rietveld refined pattern for the zircon structure as measured at ambient pressure in the dac fig 3 b depicts the multiphase refinement consisting of zircon scheelite and v 2 o 5 whereas figs 3 c d show the pure scheelite and pressure released scheelite phases respectively since the phase fraction of the v 2 o 5 was low only lebail fitting was carried out as shown in fig 3 b c however for the zircon and scheelite phases rietveld refinement was done the low intensity of the v 2 o 5 peaks facilitates the multiphase refinement of the two structures of smvo 4 the structural parameters for the 7 zircon phase at ambient pressure obtained from this data are a 7 2680 3 c 6 3914 3 and v 337 79 4 3 with various residuals of the refinement as rwp 3 9 and rp 2 82 for the scheelite phase at 10 gpa the structural parameters are a 5 044 1 c 11 275 5 and v 286 9 2 3 with various residuals of the refinement as rwp 2 4 and rp 1 8 to check the effect of x ray wavelength on partial decomposition and also the effect of experimental conditions on the compressibility behavior of the zircon and scheelite phases we have carried out another set of experiment using shorter wavelength 0 4246 with different ptm mew fig 4 shows a selection of xrd patterns for smvo 4 measured in run 2 in the figure two bragg peaks associated with cu can be easily identified since it has a different pressure evolution compared to the sample peaks at nearly ambient pressure inside the dac the xrd patterns can be unequivocally assigned to the tetragonal zircon type structure one can see it in the rietveld refinement shown in fig 5 a with the corresponding residuals of the structure determination the r factors of the refinement are rwp 3 8 and rp 2 75 the unit cell parameters determined at 0 05 gpa are a 7 2603 2 c 6 3890 3 and v 336 77 3 3 these values are comparable with those previously reported in the literature 1 9 and with the parameters determined from run 1 xrd patterns can be indexed with the initial zircon type phase up to 6 7 gpa above this pressure new bragg peaks emerge which clearly indicates the existence of a pressure induced phase transition in smvo 4 upon further compression the peaks of the low pressure phase disappear completely at 9 7 gpa therefore the two phases i e zircon and high pressure phases are found to co exist from 6 7 to 8 7 gpa the onset of the transition pressure is close to that previously reported in raman measurements carried out using same ptm onset at 6 5 gpa 18 at 9 7 gpa the xrd peaks could be assigned to the scheelite structure as found in run 1 in this regard smvo 4 behaves in similar way as orthovanadates with smaller trivalent cations luvo 4 ybvo 4 euvo 4 tbvo 4 and hovo 4 10 11 12 20 41 we have assigned the scheelite type structure to the hp phase as supported by structural refinements the residuals of the refinement at 9 7 gpa are shown in fig 5 b the r factors are rwp 3 3 and rp 2 3 the unit cell parameters of the scheelite structure at this pressure are a 5 0019 7 c 11 2341 9 and v 281 1 1 3 the scheelite structure of smvo 4 remains stable up to 20 gpa the highest pressure reached in run 2 upon decompression the phase transition is not reversible when totally releasing the force applied to the dac a pressure of 0 7 gpa is achieved due to piston 8 cylinder friction in the dac at this pressure the scheelite structure remains the stable phase as can be seen in fig 4 the unit cell parameters of the scheelite type smvo 4 at 0 7 gpa are a 5 0992 6 c 11 5115 11 and v 299 32 6 3 the obtained unit cell parameters are comparable with those reported in previous studies from quench experiments 18 42 we would like to mention here that in run 1 the onset of transition occurs at a pressure 2 gpa lower than in run 2 along with an increased pressure range of co existence of both phases 5 gpa the most probable reason for this observation could be that the sample was bridged between the diamond anvils due to high occupancy of the sample in the gasket hole resulting in large deviatoric stresses in the sample well below its hydrostatic limit 43 in order to study the effect of pressure on the crystal structure of smvo 4 theoretically in addition to zircon we considered scheelite and monazite structures most probable phases observed in rvo 4 compounds under compression however the only structures found to be stable are zircon and or scheelite in the pressure range covered in our studies fig 6 shows the total energy vs volume plot showing the stability of zircon structure at ambient pressure these curves are used to determine the p v eos of the zircon and scheelite phases inset in fig 6 shows the enthalpy vs pressure plots for zircon and scheelite structures it is clear from the figure that zircon type structure of smvo 4 has the lowest enthalpy at ambient pressure the calculated structural parameters at ambient pressure for the zircon structure are a 7 34974 c 6 41562 and v 346 564 3 these values agree within 1 with the experimental results upon compression calculations predict from the enthalpy vs pressure plot the occurrence of a zircon to scheelite phase transition at 4 5 gpa this transition pressure is in good agreement with the experimental values it is a first order transition that involves a large volume collapse v v 10 the calculated structural parameters at 7 9 gpa for the scheelite structure are a 5 06455 c 11 35874 and v 291 34 3 in table i the refined atomic positions for both the phases from two experiments along with the data obtained from theoretical calculations are given showing good agreement however the calculated lattice parameters slightly overestimate the experimental results which is usual with dft calculations in fig 7 the unit cell parameters for both the phases obtained from run 1 run 2 and theory are plotted along with the pressure released data the compressibility of a and c axis of the zircon phase is comparable from run 1 run 2 and theory however there is large scatter in c parameter of scheelite phase from me data the same effect was observed for hovo 4 12 when experimental conditions induced large deviatoric stresses this observation is compatible with the above mentioned comment on the possible sample bridging that might 9 have occurred in run 1 as a consequence of it the sample compressibility is usually reduced as was found in the experimental data obtained with the same ptm for hovo 4 12 another fact that deserves to be mentioned from fig 7 is that the c axis is less compressible than the a axis as a consequence of it the axial ratio c a is increased by 2 from ambient pressure to the transition pressure in the scheelite structure the reverse behavior is observed the most compressible axis is the c axis then the c a ratio decreases under compression about a 2 from the transition pressure to 20 gpa the same anisotropic behavior has been observed for both phases in related compounds which is associated with the different polyhedral chains present in each structure and to the fact that the smo 8 units are more compressible than the vo 4 polyhedra 15 fig 8 depicts the experimental pressure volume data for both the phases from run 1 run 2 along with theoretical results the obtained ambient pressure bulk modulus for zircon and scheelite phases by fitting the experimental data from both the runs to the 2 nd order birch murnaghan eos along with the theoretical eos are given in table ii the value of bulk modulus obtained from both runs agrees well with the theoretical results for zircon phase the values of the bulk moduli are also comparable with the values reported for the zircon phase of other vanadates 10 11 12 14 15 20 41 for the scheelite phase there is a good match between the values obtained from run 2 and theory but the value obtained from run 1 is extremely large since the hydrostatic limit of the ptm used in both runs is almost same we think that it is the effect of large amount of sample in the pressure chamber as mentioned earlier which in turn makes the compression of the sample almost like non hydrostatic leading to the observed large bulk modulus 12 43 in fact deviatoric stresses have been shown to considerably influence the hp structural behavior of the isomorphic hovo 4 cevo 4 and euvo 4 1 12 20 these studies clearly indicate the importance of sample to ptm volume filling ratio in the gasket hole to estimate the correct compressibility behavior of materials under investigation finally from the rietveld refined data from run 2 and calculations we extract the information on bond compressibility similar evolution for the bond distances are found from the experiment and calculations as depicted in fig 9 in both the phases the most compressible bonds are sm o bonds in addition after the phase transition the v o bond distance is slightly enlarged increasing the volume of vo 4 tetrahedra in case of sm o bonds the longer bond reduces at the transition whereas the shorter sm o bond increases making the smo 8 dodecahedra more regular however the overall effect of compression on smo 8 polyhedral unit is to reduce its volume both facts are a consequence of atomic rearrangement 10 associated with the first order zircon to scheelite phase transition which is reconstructive and involve the breaking of interatomic bonds and formation of new bonds in both phases the changes of the atomic bond is driven not only by the reduction of the lattice parameters when the material is squeezed but also by the movement of the oxygen atoms in zircon the internal position of the oxygen atom changes from 0 0 43132 0 20306 at ambient pressure to 0 0 43310 0 20269 at 5 gpa in the scheelite phase the internal position of oxygen changes from 0 24772 0 10938 0 04460 at 5 gpa to 0 24942 0 10169 0 04171 at the highest pressure however the changes in the atomic coordinates of oxygen are only in the third digit this suggest that our assumption that atomic positions are not affected much by pressure as done in the past 10 is not a bad approximation for estimating the bond distances for the zircon and scheelite phases of orthovanadates the elastic constants cij of smvo 4 for the low pressure zircon type structure at p 0 gpa are given in table iii these values matches well with the average values of other zircon type ortovanadates 44 the pressure evolution of the elastic constants is plotted in fig 10 although c 44 is almost constant the other elastic constants increase linearly with pressure with the exception of c 66 which exhibits an inverse relation with pressure it must be noted that though c 11 c 33 the pressure derivative of c 11 is almost twice as that of c 33 this behavior of elastic constants has been described earlier for zircon zrsio 4 45 the softening of c 66 is related to the pressure induced phase transition to the scheelite type structure as one can see in the inset of fig 10 the m 1 to m 5 criterion are fulfilled below 7 5 gpa and at 7 5 gpa the m 5 stability criterion for the zircon type structure is violated which indicates the mechanical instability of zircon structure at 7 5 gpa this pressure is an upper limit for the phase transition the result is in agreement with the theoretical and experimental findings reported here furthermore the pressure evolution of silent mode b 1 u plotted in fig 11 shows the softening and becomes imaginary at the same pressure indicating the dynamical instability of the zircon type smvo 4 at 7 8 gpa the seven elastic constants calculated for the scheelite type structure of smvo 4 at ambient pressure are presented in table iii as shown in fig 12 except for c 66 all the elastic constants increase with pressure the negative evolution of the pressure coefficient of c 66 is again related with the violation of stability criterion in this case the m 6 criterion which involves c 66 and c 16 not present for the zircon type is not fulfilled at 24 gpa inset in fig 12 this is the upper limit of the pressure beyond which the scheelite phase will be mechanically unstable beside this the acoustic infrared mode au softens and becomes 11 imaginary at 22 gpa thus the scheelite type structure of smvo 4 is dynamically unstable at this pressure this results suggests that further experimental studies beyond the pressure limit covered in this work are needed to identify the post scheelite structure of smvo 4 before concluding we would like to mention that the bulk modulus for both tetragonal structures can be obtained from the combination of the elastic constants 46 in our case the values obtained 120 9 gpa for the zircon type and 140 0 gpa for the scheelite type are in good agreement with those obtained from the calculated eos this indicates the quality and consistency of our calculations 5 conclusions the compression behavior of smvo 4 is investigated using synchrotron based powder x ray diffraction along with ab initio calculations a structural phase transition is observed in both the experiments which corroborates well with theoretical findings the present study provides quantitative information on structural parameters and equation of state of the zircon and scheelite phases the compression of both phases is found to be anisotropic the elastic constants for both the phases have also been calculated at different pressures these calculations support the existence of a zircon scheelite transition indicating that the zircon structure becomes mechanically unstable after the transition pressure finally the possible decomposition of orthovanadates when long x ray wavelengths are used is confirmed the obtained results are discussed in comparison with the known behavior of related compounds the reliability of the present experimental and theoretical results is supported by the consistency between the results yielded by both techniques acknowledgments this work was partially supported by the spanish mineco under grants mat 2013 46649 c 04 01 02 and mat 2015 71070 redc
