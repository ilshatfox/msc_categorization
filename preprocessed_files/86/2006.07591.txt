email afelix theory nipne ro abstract the empirical bath s law is derived from the magnitude difference statistical distribution of earthquake pairs it is shown that earthquake correlations can be expressed by means of the magnitude difference distribution we introduce a distinction between dynamical correla tions which imply an earthquake interaction and purely statistical correlations generated by other unknown causes the pair distri bution related to earthquake correlations is presented the single event distribution of dynamically correlated earthquakes is derived from the statistical fluctuations of the accumulation time by means of the geometric growth model of energy accumulation in the focal re gion the derivation of the gutenberg richter statistical distributions in energy and magnitude is presented as resulting from this model the dynamical correlations may account at least partially for the roff off effect in the gutenberg richter distributions it is shown that the most suitable framework for understanding the origin of the bath s law is the extension of the statistical distributions to earthquake pairs where the difference in magnitude is allowed to take negative values the seismic activity which accompanies a main shock including both the aftershocks and the foreshocks can be viewed as fluctuations in magnitude the extension of the magnitude difference to negative val ues leads to a vanishing mean value of the fluctuations and to the standard deviation as a measure of these fluctuations it is suggested that the standard deviation of the magnitude difference is the average 1 http arxiv org abs 2006 07591 v 1 difference in magnitude between the main shock and its largest after shock foreshock thus providing an insight into the nature and the origin of the bath s law it is shown that moderate magnitude dou blets may be viewed as bath partners deterministic time magnitude correlations of the accompanying seismic activity are also presented 1 introduction bath s law states that the average difference m between the magnitude of a main shock and the magnitude of its largest aftershock is independent of the magnitude of the main shock bath 1965 see also richter 1958 the reference value of the average magnitude difference is m 1 2 deviations from this value have been reported see for instance lombardi 2002 felzer et al 2002 console et al 2003 some being discussed by bath 1965 the bath s law is an empirical statistical law the earliest advance in un derstanding its origin was made by vere jones 1969 who viewed the main shock and its aftershocks as statistical events of the same statistical ensemble distributed in magnitude the magnitude difference distribution introduced by vere jones 1969 may include correlations which are viewed sometimes as indicating the opinion that the main shocks are statistically distinct from the aftershocks or the foreshocks utsu 1969 evison and rhoades 2001 the bath s law enjoyed many discussions and attempts of elucidation pa pazachos 1974 purcaru 1974 tsapanos 1990 kisslinger and jones 1991 evison 1999 lavenda and cipollone 2000 lombardi 2002 helmstetter and sornette 2003 the prevailing opinion ascribes the variations in m to the bias in selecting data and the insufficiency of the realizations of the statistical ensemble this standpoint was substantiated by means of the bino mial distribution console 2003 lombardi 2002 helmstetter and sornette 2003 in order to account for the deviations of m helmstetter and sor nette 2003 employed the etas epidemic type aftershock sequence model for the differences in the selection procedure of the mainshocks and the af tershocks according to this model the variations in the number m are related to the realizations of the statistical ensemble and the values of the fitting parameters see also lombardi 2002 console 2003 the statistical hypothesis for the distributions of earthquake time series is far reaching usually a statistical distribution is quasi independent of time it 2 is an equilibrium distribution such that the aftershocks distributed in the future should be identical with the foreshocks distributed in the past however it seems that there are differences between these two empirical dis tributions utsu 2002 shearer 2012 moreover in order the statistical laws to be operational in practice we need to have a large statistical ensem ble of accompanying associated earthquakes identified as aftershocks and foreshocks which is a difficult issue in empirical studies in addition the empirical realizations of the statistical ensembles of earthquakes should be repetitive a point which raises problems of principle considering the varia tions in time and locations in order to get meaningful results by applying the statistical laws to physical ensembles it is necessary to prepare in the same conditions identical realizations of such ensembles this is possible in statistical physics for various physical systems like gases liquids solids etc however an ensemble of earthquakes collected from a given zone in a long period of time is not reproducible because the conditions of its realization cannot be reproduced the distribution of the focal regions may change in the given zone or in the next period of time including the change in physical geological conditions the application of the statistical method to earthquakes exhibits limitations we show in this paper that the appropriate tool of approaching the accom panying seismic activity foreshocks and aftershocks of the main shocks is the distribution function of the difference in magnitude the derivation of this distribution is made herein by means of the conditional probabilities the bayes theorem as well as by using pair distributions the earthquake corre lations can be expressed by means of the magnitude difference distribution these correlations may be dynamical or purely statistical the dynamical correlations arise from an earthquake interaction while the purely sta tistical correlations originate in other unknown causes pair distributions related to statistical correlations are presented the singe event distribution of dynamically correlated earthquakes is derived from the statistical fluctu ations of the accumulation time by means of the geometric growth model of energy accumulation in the focal region the dynamical correlations may account at least partially for the roll off effect in the gutenberg richter statistical distributions the difference in magnitude is extended to negative values leading to a symmetric distribution for the foreshocks and aftershocks with a vanishing mean value for the magnitude difference this suggests to view the accompanying seismic activity as representing fluctuations and to 3 take their standard deviation as a measure for the bath s average difference m between the magnitude of the main shock and its largest aftershock foreshock this way the bath s law is deduced it is shown that moderate magnitude doublets may be viewed as bath partners deterministic time magnitude correlations of the associated seismic activity are also presented 2 gutenberg richter statistical distributions according to the geometric growth model of energy accumulation in a local ized focal region apostol 2006 a b the accumulated energy e is related to the accumulation time t by 1 t t 0 1 e e 0 r 1 where t 0 and e 0 are time and energy thresholds and r is a geometrical pa rameter which characterizes the focal region this parameter is related to the reciprocal of the number of effective dimensions of the focal region and to the strain accumulation rate which in general is anisotropic very likely the parameter r varies in the range 1 3 r 1 for a pointlike focal region with a uniform accumulation rate r 1 3 three dimensions for a two dimensional uniform focal region r 1 2 while for a one dimensional focal region r tends to unity an average parameter r may take any value in this range in equation 1 the threshold parameters should be viewed as very small such that t t 0 e e 0 1 and equation 1 may be written as t t 0 e e 0 r 2 a uniform frequency of events t 0 t in time t indicates that the parameter t 0 is the reciprocal of the seismicity rate 1 t 0 it follows immediately the time distribution p t dt 1 t t 0 2 dt t 0 3 and making use of equation 2 the energy distribution p e de r e e 0 1 r de e 0 4 4 at this point we may use an exponential law e e 0 e bm where m is the earthquake magnitude and b 3 2 ln 10 3 45 according to kanamori 1977 and hanks and kanamori 1979 see also gutenberg and richter 1944 1956 we get the normalized magnitude distribution p m dm e mdm 5 where br in decimal logarithms p m 1 5 r 10 1 5 r m where 0 5 1 5 r 1 5 for 1 3 r 1 usually the average value 1 5 r 1 2 3 is currently used as a reference value corresponding to r 2 3 see for instance stein and wysesssion 2003 udias 1999 lay and wallace 1995 frohlich and davis 1993 since t t 0 e e 0 the magnitude distribution given by equation 5 is not adequate for very small magnitudes m 0 it is worth noting that the magnitude distribution equation 5 has the property p m 1 m 2 p m 1 p m 2 while the time and energy distribu tions equations 3 and 4 have not this property this is viewed some times as indicating that the earthquakes would be correlated in occurrence time and in energy corral 2006 the magnitude distribution is particularly important because it can be used to analyze the empirical distribution p m n n 0 m t 0 n t m 6 of n earthquakes with magnitude in the range m m m out of a total number n 0 t t 0 of earthquakes which occurred in time t we get ln n t ln m t 0 m 7 from the magnitude frequency n t equation 6 we get the mean recur rence time tr t 0 m e m 8 for an earthquake with magnitude m i e in the interval m m m this time should be compared with the accumulation time ta t 0 e m for an 5 earthquake with magnitude m given by equation 2 and the exponential law e e 0 e bm these times are related by ta m tr whence one can see that ta tr for m 1 a relationship which shows that the energy corresponding to a magnitude m may be lost by seismic events lower in magnitude as expected moreover by the definition of the seismicity rate an earthquake with magnitude m is equivalent with a total number ta t 0 e m of earthquakes with zero magnitude energy e 0 michael and jones 1998 felzer et al 2002 we may call these earthquakes defined by the seismicity rate fundamental earthquakes corresponding to magnitude m it is worth noting that the magnitude distribution e m implies an error of the order m 2 m m 2 1 at least i e tr tr 0 41 for a maximal entropy with mean recurrence time tr we get easily a poisson distribution 1 tr e t tr for the recurrence time which has a large standard deviation t tr 2 tr similarly from equation 5 we get the excedence rate the so called re currence law which gives the number nex of earthquakes with magnitude greater than m the corresponding probability is readily obtained from 5 as pex e m such that the excedence rate reads lnnex lnn 0 m 9 the distributions given above may be called gutenberg richter statistical distributions equations 7 and 9 and implicitly 5 they are currently used in statistical analysis of the earthquakes the parameter is derived by fitting these distributions to data for 1 3 r 1 it varies in the range 1 15 3 45 for decimal logarithms 0 5 1 5 r 1 5 for instance an analysis of a large set of global earthquakes with 5 8 m 7 3 m 0 1 indicates 1 38 and 1 t 0 10 5 5 per year corresponding to r 0 4 a value which suggests an intermediate two three dimensional focal mechanism bullen 1963 for r 1 3 corresponding to a uniform pointlike focal geometry we get 1 15 equations 5 7 and 9 have been fitted to a set of 1999 earthquakes with magnitude m 3 m 0 1 which occurred in vrancea between 1974 2004 31 years apostol 2006 a b the mean values of the fitting parameters are ln t 0 9 68 and 1 89 r 0 54 a similar fit has been done for a set of 3640 earthquakes with magnitude m 3 which occurred in vrancea during 1981 2018 38 years the fitting parameters for this set are ln t 0 11 32 and 2 26 r 0 65 the data 6 for vrancea have been taken from the romanian earthquake catalog 2018 the parameter varies from region to region depends on the nature of the focal mechanism parameter r in br the size and the time period of the data set the range of empirical values 0 5 1 5 r 1 5 coincides with the theoretical range 1 3 r 1 the statistical analysis gives a generic image of a collective global earthquake focal region a distribution of foci particularly interesting is the parameter r which is related to the reciprocal of the average number of effective dimensions of the focal region and the rate of energy accumulation the value r 0 54 vrancea period 1974 2004 indicates a quasi two dimensional geometry of the focal region in vrancea while the more recent value r 0 65 for the same region suggests an evolution of this average geometry towards one dimension at the same time we note an increase of the seismicity rate 1 t 0 in the recent period in vrancea the increase of the geometrical parameter r determines an increase of the parameter which dominates the mean recurrence time for instance the accumulation time for magnitude m 7 is increased from ta 34 9 years period 1974 2004 to at least ta 59 years this large variability indicates the great sensitivity of the statistical analysis to the data set in particular for any fixed m we may view the exponential me m as a distribution of the parameter which indicates an error 0 41 in determining this parameter we note that inherent errors occur in statistical analysis for instance an er ror is associated to the threshold magnitude e g m 3 because the large amount of data with small magnitude may affect the fit also it is difficult to include events with high magnitude in a set with statistical significance because such events are rare the size of the statistical set may affect the results the fitting values given above for vrancea have an error of approx imately 15 such difficulties are carefully analyzed on various occasions e g felzer et al 2002 console et al 2003 lombardi 2002 helmstetter and sornette 2003 the statistical distributions given above may be employed to estimate con ditional probabilities and to derive omori laws for the associated accom panying seismic activity also the conditional probabilities can be used for analyzing the next earthquake distributions inter event time distributions apostol and cune 2020 which may offer information for seismic hazard and risk estimation we present here another example of using these distri butions in analyzing the bath s empirical law 7 3 bath s law in general two or more earthquakes may appear as being associated in time and space with or without a mutual interaction between their focal re gions in both cases they form a foreshock main shock aftershock sequence which exhibits correlations the correlations which appear as a consequence of an interaction imply an energy transfer exchange between the focal re gions e g a static stress these correlations may be called dynamical or causal correlations another type of correlations may appear without this interaction from unknown causes for instance an earthquake may produce changes in the neighbourhood of its focal region adjacent regions and these changes may influence the occurrence of another earthquake similarly an associated seismic activity may be triggered by a dynamic stress not a static one felzer and brodsky 2006 unknown causes is used here in the sense that the model employed for describing these earthquakes does not ac count for such causes the correlations arising from unknown causes may be called purely statistical or acausal correlations it is worth noting that all the correlations discussed here have a statistical character let us first discuss the dynamical correlations if an amount e of en ergy positive or negative is provided to a focal region by neighbouring focal regions the accumulation time t in the time energy accumulation law t t 0 e e 0 r equation 2 changes for a given energy we may assign this variation to the parameter r this may correspond to a change in the focal region subject to interaction as for instance one produced by a static stress we are led to examine the changes in the accumulation time t we have shown above that the ratio t t 0 is the number n 0 e m of fundamen tal earthquakes corresponding to the magnitude m where t 0 is the cutoff time time threshold equations 2 to 5 we may write approximately this large number as the sum n 0 n 0 i 1 ni ni 1 10 in this equation we may view ni as statistical variables with mean value ni 1 therefore we consider the number of fundamental earthquakes n n 0 i 1 ni 11 8 with the mean value n n 0 the variables ni are viewed as independent statistical variables their fluctuations are due to the interaction of these fun damental earthquakes with other fundamental earthquakes corresponding to different magnitudes exchange of numbers of fundamental earthquakes these interactions play the role of an external thermal bath for the funda mental earthquakes corresponding to a given magnitude m therefore the deviation n n 2 where n n n 0 ni ni ni is the number nc of dynamically correlated fundamental earthquakes corresponding to m we get immediately n 2 n 0 i j 1 ni nj n 0 i 1 ni 2 a 2 n 0 12 where a 2 ni 2 independent of i it follows nc a n 0 ae 1 2 m 13 obviously this number is tc at 0 where tc is the accumulation time for the correlated earthquakes with magnitude m in order to preserve the corre spondence of the cutoff time and energy parameters we need to re define the cutoff time t 0 as at 0 now we can repeat the derivation from equations 2 to 5 and get the magnitude probability of the correlated earthquakes pc m 1 2 e 1 2 m 14 we note that in the energy accumulation law given by equation 2 the pa rameter r changes to r 2 for dynamically correlated earthquakes tc at 0 e e 0 r 2 the dynamically correlated earthquakes may be present in foreshock main shock aftershock sequences it is difficult to test empirically the probability pc m because we cannot see any means to separate the dynamical corre lations from the purely statistical correlations we note that the dynam ically correlated earthquakes are distinct from the rest of the earthquakes their distribution e 12 m is different from the distribution e m usu ally in empirical studies we do not make this difference see for instance kisslinger 1996 but the error may be neglected because the total num ber of earthquakes n 0 is much larger than the total number of dynami cally correlated earthquakes nc according to equations 5 6 and 14 9 n 2 c 4 n 2 c n m n 0 nc is simply proportional to the statistical er ror n 0 like the total number of earthquakes the dynamically correlated earthquakes are concentrated in the region of small magnitudes where the slope of the function lnpc m is changed from to 12 such a devi ation is well known in empirical studies the roll off effect pelletier 2000 bhattacharya et al 2009 and is attributed usually to an insufficient de termination of the small magnitude data moreover small magnitude cor related earthquakes in foreshock main shock aftershock sequences are asso ciated with high magnitude main shocks which have a large productivity of accompanying events therefore dynamically correlated earthquakes are expected in earthquake clusters with high magnitude main shocks the bath s law is expressed in terms of the difference in magnitude between the main shock and its largest aftershock let us first consider two earth quakes with magnitudes m 1 2 with the distribution law e m m m 1 2 and seek the distribution of the difference in magnitude m m 1 m 2 in this law the magnitude m is positive but for the difference m 1 m 2 we need to extend this variable to negative values since m 1 m 1 m 2 m 2 and m 2 m 2 m 1 m 1 the law e 1 2 m suggests a magnitude difference distribution e m 1 m 2 for m 1 m 2 and fixed m 2 and a distribution e m 2 m 1 for m 2 m 1 and fixed m 1 these are conditional probabilities related to the bayes theorem in both cases this distribution can be written as e m where m m 1 m 2 or m m 2 m 1 m max m 1 m 2 irrespective of which m 1 2 is fixed the condition m max m 1 m 2 is es sential for statistical correlations we pass now to the bath s law let us as sume a main shock with magnitude ms and the accompanying earthquakes foreshocks and aftershocks with magnitude m we define the foreshocks and aftershocks as those correlated earthquakes with magnitude m smaller than ms we refer the magnitudes m of the foreshocks and aftershocks to the magnitude ms of the main shock by observing the ordering of the partners in each pair this can be done by defining m ms m 0 for foreshocks and m m ms 0 for aftershocks according to the above discussion the distribution of the magnitude difference is e m m ms therefore the total distribution is p ms m 2 e mse m m ms ms 0 15 this is a pair distribution for two events ms and m let us apply first this law to dynamically correlated earthquakes by replacing 10 in equation 15 by 2 since these earthquake clusters are associated with high magnitude main shocks we may omit the condition m ms and let m go to infinity in this case the statistical correlations are lost we are left only with the dynamical correlations the distribution given by equation 15 becomes a distribution of two independent events identifed by ms and m we may use only the magnitude difference distribution pc m 1 4 e 1 2 m m 16 this distribution has a vansihing mean value m m 0 the next correction to this mean value i e the smallest deviation of m is the standard deviation m m 2 2 2 17 therefore we may conclude that the average difference in magnitude be tween the main shock and its largest aftershock or foreshock is given by the standard deviation m m 2 2 this is the bath s law the number 2 2 does not depend on the magnitude ms but it depends on the parameter corresponding to various realizations of the statistical ensem ble it is worth noting that m given by equation 17 implies an averaging of the squared magnitude differences making use of the reference value 2 3 we get m 1 23 which is the bath s reference value for the mag nitude difference in the geometric growth model the reference value 2 3 corresponds to the parameter r 2 3 we can check that higher order mo ments m 2 n n 2 3 are larger than m 2 for any value of in the range 1 15 3 45 the result m 2 2 could be tested empirically although as it is well known there exist difficulties in empirical studies the magnitude difference m is variable depending on the fitting parameter which can be obtained from the statistical analysis of the data the results may tend to the value m 1 2 by adjusting the cutoff magnitudes lombardi 2002 console 2003 or by choosing particular values of fitting parameters helmstetter and sornette 2003 there are cases when the data exhibit values close to m 1 2 felzer et al 2002 it seems that values closer to m 1 2 occur more frequently in the small number of sequences which include high magnitude main shocks 11 if we extend the dynamical correlations to moderate magnitude main shocks we need to keep the condition m ms such that the distribution is pc ms m 1 4 2 e 1 2 mse 1 2 m m ms ms 0 18 the standard deviation is now m m 2 which leads to m 0 61 for the reference value 2 3 such a variablility of m can of ten be found in empirical studies for instance from the analysis made by lombardi 2002 of southern california earthquakes 1990 2001 we may infere 2 and an average m 0 45 with large errors from console et al 2003 new zealand catalog 1962 1999 and preliminary determination of epicentres catalog 1973 2001 we may infere 2 5 2 3 and an average m 0 43 0 54 respectively while m 2 gives 0 56 0 61 in other cases like the california nevada data analyzed by felzer et al 2002 the parameters are 2 3 and m 1 2 in agreement with m 2 2 we note that m 2 given here is an over estimate because it extends in fact the dynamical correlations equation 14 to small magnitude main shocks leaving aside the dynamical correlations we are left with purely statistical correlations for clusters with moderate magnitude main shocks in this case we use the distribution given by equation 15 which leads to m m 1 2 and m 0 31 for the reference vale 2 3 the bath partner for such a small value of the magnitude difference looks rather as a doublet poupinet et al 1984 felzer et al 2004 for statistical correlations we can compute the correlation coefficient vari ance the correlation coefficient r msm ms m between the main shock and an accompanying event m ms m m ms computed by using the distribution given in equation 15 is r 2 5 for the cor relation coefficient beteen two accompanying events m 1 and m 2 we need the three events distribution which includes m 1 2 and ms 4 pair distribution in general the correlations are visible in the pair two event bivariate distri butions such distributions are obtained as the mixed second order deriva 12 tive of a generating function of two variables we give here the pair dis tribution derived from the geometric growth model of energy accumulation we show that it coincides practically with the pair distribution used above equation 15 moreover the pair distribution derived here exhibits the dynamical correlations the single event probability p t given by equation 3 is obtained as the derivative p t f t of the frequency func tion f t t 0 t similarly by using the change of variable t t 0 e m we get the gutenberg richter magnitude distribution p m e m from p m f m where f m e m equation 5 let us assume that two successive earthquakes may occur in time t one after time t 1 t 0 e m 1 another after time t 2 t 0 e m 2 from the occurrence of the former using the partition t t 1 t 2 we get the distribution p t 1 t 2 2 f t 1 t 2 2 t 0 t 1 t 2 3 19 or properly normalized p m 1 m 2 4 2 e m 1 m 2 e m 1 e m 2 3 20 we can see that this distribution is different from p m 1 p m 2 2 e m 1 m 2 which indicates that the two events m 1 2 are correlated let m 1 m 2 m and m 1 m 2 0 m m 1 equation 20 becomes p m 1 m 2 4 2 e m 1 e m 1 e m 3 21 similarly for m 2 m 1 m 2 m 0 we get p m 1 m 2 4 2 e m 2 e m 1 e m 3 22 it follows that we may write p m 1 m 2 4 2 e max m 1 m 2 e m 1 e m 3 23 which highlights the magnitude difference distribution with the constraint m max m 1 m 2 13 let ms and m be the magnitudes of the main shock and an acompanying earthquake foreshock or aftershock respectively we define the ordered magnitude difference m ms m 0 for foreshocks and m m ms 0 for aftershocks m ms according to equation 23 the distribution of the pair consisting of the main shock and an acompanying event is p ms m 4 2 e ms e m 1 e m 3 m ms 24 the exponential e m falls off rapidly to zero for increasing m so we may neglect it in the denominator in equation 24 we are left with the pair distribution given by equation 15 properly normalized if we integrate equation 20 with respect to m 2 and redefine m 1 m we get the so called marginal distribution pmg m e m 2 1 e m 2 25 this distribution differs appreciably from the gutenberg richter distribution e m for m 1 and only slightly by an almost constant factor 2 for moderate and large magnitudes the corresponding cummulative distribu tion for all magnitudes greater than m p exmg m e m 2 1 e m 26 can be written as p exmg m e m 1 1 1 2 m e 1 2 m 27 in the limit m 0 which indicates that the slope of the excedence rate lnp exmg m deviates from corresponding to the usual gutenberg richter exponential distribution to 1 2 the roll off effect this deviation indi cates the presence of dynamical correlations governed by the distribution law pc m 1 2 e 1 2 m equation 14 the pair distribution given above can be written both for the earthquakes governed by the gutenberg richter distribution e m and for the sub set of dynamically correlated earthquakes governed by the distribution 14 e 1 2 m the procedure of extracting dynamically correlated earthquakes can be iterated passing from 2 to 4 etc however the number of affected earthquakes tends rapidly to zero and the procedure becomes irrelevant we may assume that energy e is released by two successive earthquakes with energies e 1 2 e 0 e bm 1 2 such that e e 1 e 2 the time corresponding to the energy e is t t 0 e 1 e 0 e 2 e 0 r or t t 0 ebm 1 ebm 2 we cannot derive a pair distribution from the second order derivative of t 0 t ebm 1 ebm 2 1 because the variation of the magnitudes m 1 2 implies the variation of the energies e 1 2 and not of the times t 1 2 this would contradict the geometric growth model which assumes that the probabilities are given by time derivatives 5 time magnitude correlations let us assume that the amount of energy e accumulated in time t is released by two successive earthquakes with energies e 1 2 such as e e 1 e 2 since according to equation 2 t t 0 e e 0 r e 1 e 0 e 2 e 0 r e 1 e 0 r e 2 e 0 r t 1 t 0 t 2 t 0 28 where t 1 2 are the accumulation times for the energies e 1 2 we can see that the time corresponding to the pair energy is shorter than the sum of the independent accumulation times of the members of the pair as expected for correlated earthquakes this is another type of correlations different from dynamical or statistical correlations they are deterministic correlations arising from the non linearity of the accumulation law given by equation 2 the time interval between the two successive earthquakes t 1 1 e 2 e 1 r 1 29 given by t t 1 depends on the accumulation time t 1 if we introduce the magnitudes m 1 2 in equation 29 we get t 1 1 e bm r 1 30 15 figure 1 the magnitude m 2 of the accompanying seismic events vs the time elapsed from the main event with magnitude m 1 and accumulation time t 1 equation 34 for m 1 5 b 3 45 r 2 3 the bath partner m 2 3 8 corresponds to 0 t 1 5 10 3 higher values of the magnitude m 2 occur at much longer times where the correlations are unlikely where m m 1 m 2 we can see that this equation relates the time to the magnitude difference the same equation can be applied to dynamically correlated earthquakes by replacing r by r 2 we get t 1 1 e bm r 2 1 31 these correlations can be called time magnitude correlations we apply this equation to a main shock aftershock sequence where m 1 is the magnitude of the main shock m 0 similar results are valid for the foreshock main shock sequence for the largest aftershock foreshock where m may be replaced by m 2 2 we get 0 t 1 1 e b m r 2 1 1 2 rt 1 e b m 1 2 rt 1 e 2 2 r 32 for b m 1 this is the occurrence time of the bath partner measured from the occurrence of the main shock the ratio 0 t 1 varies between 3 5 10 5 r 1 3 and 3 10 2 r 1 for r 2 3 we get 0 t 1 5 10 3 it is worth noting according to equation 28 that a partner close to the 16 main shock in magnitude bm 1 occurs after a lapse of time t t 1 2 r 2 1 33 which is much greater than 0 t t 1 varies between 0 12 and 0 41 for 1 3 r 1 we can see that even if the pair probability p m 4 e 1 2 m is greater for m 0 an earthquake close in magnitude to the main shock occurs much later where it may be difficult to view it as an aftershock and similarly for the foreshocks since 1 e bm r 2 in equation 31 is a decreasing function of m we can say indeed that the largest aftershock is farther in time with respect to the main shock in comparison with aftershocks lower in magnitude the duration 0 given by equations 32 for the occurrence of the largest aftershock may be taken as a measure of the extension in time of the aftershock and the foreshock activity it may serve as a criterion for defining the accompaning seismic activity also it is worth noting in this context that the energy probability of two independent earthquakes with energies e 1 2 is p e 1 p e 2 where p e 1 2 is given by equation 4 similarly for the time probability on the other hand if these two earthquakes are correlated then the conditional probability is obtained from p e 1 e 2 as in equation 28 from equation 31 we can get the distribution of the magnitudes m 2 of the acompanying earthquakes with respect to the time measured from the occurrence of the main shock with magnitude m 1 either in the future aftershocks or in the past foreshocks indeed we get m 2 m 1 1 b ln 1 t 1 2 r 1 34 where t 1 t 0 e 1 2 m 1 is the accumulation time of the main shock m 2 in equation 34 is defined for 1 e bm 1 r 2 1 t 1 2 r 2 1 0 m 2 m 1 the function m 2 is plotted in fig 1 vs t 1 for b 3 45 r 2 3 2 3 and m 1 5 for t 1 very close to zero the magnitude m 2 is vanishing and for t 1 2 r 2 1 the magnitude m 2 tends to m 1 the bath partner occurs at 0 t 1 12 re 2 2 r 5 10 3 with the magnitude m 2 3 8 the function m 2 t 1 is a very steep function for the whole reasonable range of parameters the whole accompanying seismic activity is practically concentrated in the lapse of time 0 on the scale t 1 the pair 17 probability of this activity is an abruptly increasing function of m 2 if we use m 2 given by equation 34 in the distribution 1 2 e 1 2 m 2 for small values of t 1 we get an omori type law as expected apostol 2006 c finally we note that the aftershock foreshock magnitude m 2 given by equa tion 34 can be approximated by m 2 1 r 2 m 1 1 b ln 2 rt 0 35 for 1 2 re 1 r 2 bm 1 t 0 2 r 2 1 e 1 2 m 1 36 where t 0 is the cutoff time the lower bound 1 2 rt 0 e 1 r 2 bm 1 in equation 36 corresponds to a very small quiescence time elapsed from the occurence of the main shock m 2 0 this time is much shorter than the cutoff time t 0 so in fact it is irrelevant the cumulative fraction of aftershocks foreshocks with magnitude from zero to m 2 is ncum n 1 e 1 2 m 2 where n is the total number of aftershocks foreshocks making use of equation 35 we get the cumulative fraction for time ncum n 1 rt 0 2 r 2 e 1 2 1 r 2 m 1 37 this fraction is a rapidly increasing function of time as it was pointed out recently by ogata and tsuruoka 2016 the cutoff time which is necessary in equation 37 remains an empirical parameter 6 concluding remarks in foreshock main shock aftershock sequences of associated accompanying earthquakes we can discerne in principle two types of correlations one type which we call dynamical or causal correlations imply an interaction between earthquakes i e an interaction between their focal regions e g a static stress another type consists of purely statistical or acausal correla tions though both types have a statistical character dynamical correlations imply a variation fluctuation of the accumulation time which is estimated by means of the geometric growth model of energy accumulation in the focal 18 region this way the number of dynamically correlated earthquakes is de rived as a statistical standard deviation and the single event distribution law for these earthquakes is deduced it is a gutenberg richter type exponential law with the parameter changed into 2 this change reflects a roll off effect in the gutenberg richter statistical distribution related mainly to clusters with high magnitude main shocks the correlations are discussed by means of the magnitude difference distri bution for earthquake pairs where the difference in magnitude is extended to negative values this distribution has a vanishing mean value of the mag nitude difference such that the foreshock aftershock seismic activity appears as fluctuations in magnitude the corresponding standard deviation is the average diference in magnitudes between the main shock and its greatest af tershock foreshock this difference in magnitude is given by m 2 2 for dynamically correlated earthquakes which leads to m 1 2 for the reference value 2 3 1 for decimal logarithms this is the bath s law if we allow for purely statistical correlations the difference in magnitude is approximately m 2 the difference between these two formulae and the variability of the parameter may explain the variability in the re sults of the statistical analysis of empirical data for m we note that it is difficult to differentiate empirically between dynamical and purely statis tical correlations for earthquake clusters with moderate magnitude main shocks the purely statistical correlations dominate they lead to a bath s law m 1 2 which gives m 0 31 for the reference value 2 3 indicating rather doublets as bath s partners the roll off effect in the gutenberg richter distribution and the presence of the dynamical correlations are also indicated by the pair two event bivari ate distribution which is derived by means of the geometric growth model of energy accumulation the same model is used to derive the determinis tic time magnitude correlations occurring in earthquake clusters the time delay between the main shock and its largest aftershock foreshock is esti mated it is suggested to use this time interval as a criterion of estimating the temporal extension of the aftershock foreshock activity acknowledgements the author is indebted to
