to model the thermal structure of polythermal ice sheets accurately energy conserving schemes and correct tracking of the cold temperate transition surface cts are necessary we compare four different thermodynamics solvers in the ice sheet model sicopolis two exist already namely a two layer polythermal scheme poly and a single phase cold ice scheme cold while the other two are newly implemented one layer enthalpy schemes namely a conventional scheme entc and a melting cts scheme entm the comparison uses scenarios of the eismint phase 2 simplified geometry experiments payne and others 2000 j glaciol 46 227 238 the poly scheme is used as a reference against which the performance of the other schemes is tested both the cold scheme and the entc scheme fail to produce a continuous temperature gradient across the cts which is explicitly enforced by the entm scheme entm is more precise than entc for determining the position of the cts while the per formance of both schemes is good for the temperature water content profiles in the entire ice column therefore the one layer enthalpy schemes entc and entm are viable easier implementable alternatives to the poly scheme with its need to handle two different numerical domains for cold and temperate ice keywords ice sheet thermodynamics polythermal ice enthalpy method modeling 1 introduction many glaciers and ice sheets are polythermal with disjoint cold and temperate domains separated by the cold temperate transition surface cts blatter and hutter 1991 both the greenland and antarctic ice sheets are canadian type polythermal that is they are mainly cold except for distributed temperate layers at the base where strain heating is largest and where there is a geothermal contribution it is thus important to model the thermody namics of ice sheets correctly by distinguishing both domains and accounting for the transition conditions between them various methods allow one to model the thermodynamic conditions in ice sheets thus far sicopolis simu lation code for polythermal ice sheets e g greve 1997 b sato and greve 2012 greve and herzfeld 2013 url www sicopolis net is the only three dimensional ice sheet model that employs the polythermal two layer scheme in this method the temperature and water content fields in the two domains cold and temperate ice are computed on separate numerical domains and the transition conditions at the cts are used to track its position in most older ice sheet models e g huybrechts 1990 calov and hutter 1996 payne and dongelmans 1997 ritz and others 1997 the cold ice method was applied by resetting any computed temperatures that exceed the local pressure melting point to the local pressure melting point while very simple this means that energy is lost and the water content in the temperate layer as well as the transition conditions at the cts are ignored the cold ice method has however always been available in sicopolis as an alternative to the polythermal two layer method aschwanden and others 2012 introduced a new enthalpy based approach for ice sheet thermodynamics in this method the thermodynamic fields of temperature in cold ice and water content in temperate ice are replaced by one polar science 10 1 11 23 2016 authors version doi 10 1016 j polar 2015 12 004 may 12 2019 ar x iv 1 50 6 02 36 4 v 4 ph ys ic s ao p h 2 9 f eb 2 01 6 common thermodynamic field enthalpy 1 for both domains and only one common field equation must be solved however the stefan type energy and mass flux matching conditions at the cts which are important for determining its position greve 1997 a are not included explicitly in the formulation of the enthalpy scheme by aschwanden and others 2012 following the terminology of blatter and greve 2015 we refer to it as the conventional one layer enthalpy scheme this scheme has already been used in a number of ice sheet and glacier models brinkerhoff and johnson 2013 golledge and others 2013 seroussi and others 2013 wilson and flowers 2013 gilbert and others 2014 kleiner and others 2015 two different conditions of the cts must be distinguished for melting conditions cold ice flows across the cts into the temperate layer where water starts to accumulate due to strain heating along trajectories the opposite situation freezing conditions occurs further downstream where temperate ice flows across the cts into the cold domain and the accumulated water content freezes out releasing latent heat for melting conditions the temperature gradient and the water content are continuous across the cts while for freezing conditions discontinuities of these quantities occur greve 1997 a since the cts tends to be rather steep near the terminus only a small area of the cts is freezing and therefore in results of ice sheet models freezing conditions usually only occur at very few isolated grid points greve 1997 b kleiner and others 2015 tested the implementation of the conventional enthalpy scheme for a canadian type parallel sided slab in one finite difference and two finite element ice sheet models tim fd 3 issm comice blat ter and greve 2015 compared the performance of four different versions of the enthalpy scheme for a parallel sided slab with a custom designed finite difference program besides the conventional enthalpy scheme they considered the two layer front tracking enthalpy scheme an enthalpy version of the polythermal two layer scheme mentioned above the one layer melting cts enthalpy scheme and the one layer freezing cts enthalpy scheme in the two latter schemes explicit tracking of the melting or freezing cts based on the respective transition conditions at the cts has been added to the conventional enthalpy scheme an important finding of these works was that the conventional one layer enthalpy scheme can produce correct solutions for melting conditions at the cts provided that the numer ical handling of the discontinuity of the enthalpy diffusivity across the cts is done carefully however especially for finite difference techniques blatter and greve 2015 concluded that it is safer to use the one layer melting cts enthalpy scheme which enforces the transition conditions explicitly for freezing conditions the conventional one layer enthalpy scheme fails because it cannot handle the associated discontinuities of the thermodynamic fields and it is thus imperative to enforce the transition conditions at the cts explicitly as it is done in the one layer freezing cts enthalpy scheme for this study in addition to the previously existing polythermal two layer and cold ice schemes we have imple mented the conventional one layer enthalpy scheme and the one layer melting cts enthalpy scheme in the sicopo lis model for the reason given above freezing conditions are not considered here we attempt to test and verify these four schemes in sicopolis and in particular to test how the various schemes handle the melting cts between cold and temperate ice for canadian type polythermal situations in ice sheets based on the results of blatter and greve 2015 we consider the polythermal two layer scheme to be the most reliable method and thus use its results as benchmark solutions in sections 2 and 3 we give an overview of the theory of ice sheet thermodynamics and describe the implementation of the various schemes in sicopolis section 4 gives the set up of the scenarios derived from the suite of eismint european ice sheet modeling initiative phase 2 simplified geometry experiments payne and others 2000 used for this study in section 5 we discuss the results focusing on the simulated thickness of the temperate ice layer section 6 concludes the paper 2 outline of ice sheet thermodynamics 2 1 standard polythermal thermodynamics the standard description of the thermodynamics of polythermal ice masses for which we follow largely greve 1997 a is based on the fields of absolute temperature t in cold ice and water content w in temperate ice the evolution equation for temperature in cold ice is given by t t v grad t 1 c z t z q c 1 1 owing to the incompressibility of ice the enthalpy is identical to the internal energy 2 where t denotes time z the vertical spatial coordinate v the three dimensional velocity vector 910 kg m 3 the ice density the temperature dependent heat conductivity of cold ice and c the temperature dependent heat capacity of cold ice also q tr t d is the volumetric strain heating where t is the cauchy stress tensor d the strain rate tensor the middle dot denotes tensor contraction and tr the trace of a tensor horizontal diffusion terms have been neglected which can be justified by scaling arguments making use of the shallowness of ice sheets e g greve and blatter 2009 similar to eq 1 the evolution equation for water content in temperate ice reads w t v grad w 1 z w z q l c l tm t v grad tm 1 l z tm z 2 where is the water diffusivity in temperate ice assumed to be constant and l 3 35 105 j kg 1 the latent heat of fusion the very small terms in the second line of the equation arise from the fact that the temperature in temperate ice is not constant but equal to the melting temperature tm that depends on the local pressure p tm p t 0 p 3 where t 0 273 15 k is the reference temperature and 9 8 10 8 k pa 1 the clausius clapeyron constant for air saturated glacier ice hooke 2005 as in eq 1 horizontal diffusion terms have been neglected in the evolution equation 2 as already mentioned in sect 1 for melting conditions at the cts the temperature gradient and the water content must be continuous across the cts greve 1997 a if we mark values at the cold side of the cts by plus superscripts values at the temperate side by minus superscripts and denote the normal unit vector pointing into the cold side by n this reads grad t n grad t m n 4 and w w 0 5 for freezing conditions the situation is more complicated in that the temperature gradient and the water content are in general discontinuous across the cts blatter and hutter 1991 greve 1997 a however as already mentioned in sect 1 this situation usually occurs only on very small parts of the cts and therefore we do not consider freezing conditions in this study at the ice surface we prescribe the surface temperature as a dirichlet type boundary condition at the ice base three different cases must be distinguished for a cold base the geothermal heat flux determines the normal derivative of the temperature neumann type boundary condition for a temperate base with no temperate ice layer above the temperature is equal to the pressure melting point for a temperate base with a temperate ice layer above in addition to that a boundary condition for the basal water content is required unless the water diffusivity is neglected in order to influence the solution as little as possible we choose the neumann type zero flux condition w z 0 in order to prevent the water content in temperate ice from rising to unreasonable levels due to the accumu lated strain heating a drainage model is required we have kept the simple formulation previously implemented in sicopolis which assumes that any water exceeding the prescribed threshold of wmax 0 01 1 is drained instantaneously the transport mechanism to the ice base remains unmodeled however the amount of drained water is added to the computed basal melt rate and thus accounted for in the computation of the vertical velocity and the evolution of the ice thickness 2 2 enthalpy method as an alternative to the polythermal thermodynamics outlined in sect 2 1 aschwanden and others 2012 intro duced the enthalpy method its strength is that it combines the temperature and water content into a single thermody namic field the specific enthalpy for which a single field equation holds 3 the specific enthalpy h of ice at absolute temperature t and water content w is given by h t w t t 0 c t dt lw 6 inversely the temperature and water content are not unique functions of the enthalpy because of the dependence of the melting temperature on the pressure eq 3 we denote the inverse of eq 6 for zero water content w 0 by t h and the enthalpy of ice at the melting point for zero water content by hm hm p h tm p w 0 tm p t 0 c t dt 7 the temperature and water content can then be obtained by t h p t h h hm p tm p h hm p 8 w h p 0 h hm p h hm p l h hm p 9 the balance equation for enthalpy reads h t v grad h z kc t h z q 10 where kc t kc c h hm p kt h hm p 11 are the enthalpy diffusivities in cold subscript c and temperate subscript t ice respectively like in eqs 1 and 2 horizontal diffusion terms have been neglected in eq 10 while vertical diffusion is present in both cold and temperate ice the transition conditions for a melting cts eqs 4 and 5 transform into physically equivalent enthalpy con ditions inserting eq 5 in eq 6 and considering that the temperature on both sides of the cts is equal to the pressure melting point tm yields the continuity of the enthalpy h h hm 12 on the cold side of the cts w 0 holds everywhere so that differentiating eq 6 yields grad h c tm grad t on the temperate side differentiating eq 7 yields grad h m c tm grad t m hence the enthalpy form of eq 4 is grad h n grad h m n 13 which expresses the continuity of the sensible heat flux note that the enthalpy gradient across the cts is in general discontinuous grad h n grad h n because the enthalpy in the temperate ice layer becomes larger than hm away from the cts due to the increasing water content for freezing conditions in general the enthalpy and the sensible heat flux are discontinuous h h grad h n grad h m n the exact form of the transition conditions shall not be given here by employing eq 6 the boundary conditions for the ice surface and base as well as the simple drainage model given in the last two paragraphs of sect 2 1 translate readily to the enthalpy formulation however for a temperate base with a temperate ice layer above instead of the zero flux condition for the water content w z 0 we use the zero flux condition for the enthalpy h z 0 since the temperature in temperate ice is not constant eq 3 these conditions are not equivalent but the difference is small and both conditions are ad hoc anyway so that this is acceptable for the sake of simplicity 4 3 thermodynamics solvers in sicopolis previous versions of sicopolis 3 1 and older contained two different options for dealing with ice sheet ther modynamics these are the polythermal two layer scheme and the cold ice scheme here we added two more options based on the enthalpy method and the schemes described by blatter and greve 2015 namely the conventional one layer enthalpy scheme and the one layer melting cts enthalpy scheme freezing conditions at the cts are not considered blatter and greve 2015 elaborated the schemes only for a one dimensional problem parallel sided slab here we extended them to three dimensions sicopolis uses terrain following sigma coordinates and the transforma tion to these coordinates produces extra terms e g greve and blatter 2009 sect 5 7 1 however since horizontal diffusion has been neglected in eq 10 even in the transformed coordinates no mixing of horizontal and vertical derivatives of the enthalpy h occurs this allows employing an implicit discretization scheme for the vertical deriva tives and an explicit scheme for the horizontal derivatives in the same way as for the temperature and water content equations 1 and 2 greve 1997 b thus the numerical solution for each vertical profile is similar to the solution of the one dimensional problem by an implicit scheme and the horizontal advection terms of the three dimensional equation play the role of additional explicitly discretized source terms 3 1 polythermal two layer scheme poly the polythermal two layer scheme scheme code poly is the most sophisticated but also the most complex method to simulate polythermal ice masses it splits the computational domain numerically into two distinct layers of cold and temperate ice and solves the evolution equations for temperature in cold ice eq 1 and water content in temperate ice eq 2 on two different grids blatter and hutter 1991 greve 1997 a pettersson and others 2007 in this method the cts is fixed with the lower and upper boundaries of the cold and temperate domains respectively and thus can be tracked very precisely with the transition condition at the cts the method works for both melting and freezing conditions at the cts in particular it can cope with the discon tinuities of the temperature gradient and the water content that accompany freezing conditions it is implemented in sicopolis as an iterative trial and error procedure for each time step and each ice column for which an internal cts is detected the temperature problem for the upper cold ice region and the water content problem for the lower temperate ice region are solved repeatedly with different test positions of the cts until all boundary and transition conditions are fulfilled this is discussed in more detail by greve 1997 b last paragraph of section 2 for the simula tions discussed in this study we disregard freezing conditions and apply the poly scheme only for assumed melting conditions at the cts the ability to turn off the freezing conditions is a newly implemented option for the poly scheme 3 2 cold ice scheme cold the cold ice scheme scheme code cold is the most simple yet physically incorrect way to deal with poly thermal conditions in ice sheets sicopolis applies the cold scheme by solving the temperature equation 1 for the entire domain and resetting any temperatures t exceeding the local pressure melting point tm eq 3 to t tm the excess heat of the temperate layer becomes lost so that the scheme does not conserve energy 3 3 conventional one layer enthalpy scheme entc the conventional one layer enthalpy scheme scheme code entc corresponds to the enthalpy method by as chwanden and others 2012 the enthalpy equation 10 is solved for the entire polythermal domain on a single numerical grid and the cts is diagnostically determined as the uppermost grid point of the temperate layer that is the uppermost grid point for which h hm holds the transition conditions at the cts eqs 12 and 13 for melting conditions or their more complicated counterparts for freezing conditions are not enforced explicitly 5 3 4 one layer melting cts enthalpy scheme entm the one layer melting cts enthalpy scheme scheme code entm by blatter and greve 2015 differs from the conventional one layer enthalpy entc scheme in that the continuity condition 13 at a melting cts is enforced explicitly this is achieved for each vertical column possessing an internal cts that is a non vanishing thickness of temperate ice at the base in two steps in a predictor step the enthalpy profile is computed for the entire vertical column like in the entc scheme the cts is then positioned at the uppermost point in the temperate layer in a corrector step the enthalpy profile in the upper cold layer only is recomputed by using condition 13 as lower boundary condition the updated enthalpy profile then consists of the predictor step for the temperate layer and the corrector step for the cold layer for the technical details of the scheme see blatter and greve 2015 the implementation of both the entc and the entm scheme in sicopolis has the same topological restriction as the poly scheme it only allows for canadian type polythermal conditions that is only one cts can exist in each column of ice and the cold layer is always situated above the temperate layer however this is not a fundamental restriction for the enthalpy schemes in principle they also allow dealing with more complex and or changing topolo gies such as temperate ice at the surface prescribed water content instead of prescribed temperature as a boundary condition at the surface bubbles of temperate ice within cold ice etc 4 experiment set up we tested the four different schemes described in sect 3 with modified versions of the eismint phase 2 simpli fied geometry experiments a and h as defined in payne and others 2000 the computational domain in the horizon tal plane is a square of 1500 by 1500 km spanned by the cartesian coordinates x 0 1500 km y 0 1500 km the numerical values of the dynamical and thermodynamical parameters are given in payne and others 2000 see also sect 2 the experiments were performed using sicopolis version 3 2 dev revision 471 with three different combinations of horizontal grid resolution x y and time step t namely x t 10 km 2 a 5 km 2 a and 10 km 20 a for the 10 km resolution this leads to 151 151 grid points indices i 0 150 j 0 150 in the horizontal domain while for the 5 km resolution the domain is covered by 301 301 grid points the stan dard vertical resolution is 81 grid points in the upper domain terrain following vertical coordinate c 0 1 index kc 0 80 and for the poly scheme 11 grid points in the lower domain terrain following vertical coordinate t 0 1 index kt 0 10 for the other three schemes the lower domain is not used for the 10 km 2 a combination we also consider a five times higher vertical resolution abbreviated as hvr with 401 grid points in the upper and 51 grid points in the lower domain both the heat capacity c and the heat conductivity depend significantly on temperature e g greve and blatter 2009 the implementation of all thermodynamics schemes in sicopolis accounts for that possibility by allowing both quantities to vary in space and time this is particularly relevant for discretizing the vertical diffusion terms in eqs 1 2 and 10 that contain within z terms however in the eismint set up used here the values are taken as constants c 2009 j kg 1 k 1 and 2 1 w m 1 k 1 payne and others 2000 the diffusive flux in the temperate layer is likely very small for small water contents however virtually no information on the value of the water diffusivity is available in sicopolis a value of 10 6 kg m 1 s 1 is implemented for reasons of numerical stability rather than for physical reasons this leads to kt 1 1 10 9 m 2 s 1 while kc c 1 1 10 6 m 2 s 1 thus a three orders of magnitude difference 4 1 eismint experiment a 1 the experiment is started with no ice conditions and runs for 200 ka to reach a steady state the ice sheet rests on a flat rigid base no isostatic adjustment the boundary conditions are circularly symmetric with respect to the center of the domain the prescribed surface temperature increases linearly with distance from the center with a minimum value of 238 15 k at the center summit and a horizontal gradient of 1 67 10 2 k km 1 similarly the surface mass balance is prescribed by a piece wise linear function with a maximum accumulation rate of 0 5 m a 1 in the interior of the ice sheet from the center to 400 km away from the center and a horizontal gradient of 10 2 m a 1 km 1 beyond that which leads to an equilibrium line 450 km from the center and an ablation zone further out with these assumptions the evolving ice sheet thickness does not feed back on the surface mass balance at the ice base no slip conditions are assumed everywhere and the geothermal heat flux is 42 mw m 2 6 there are two differences compared to the original eismint experiment a the first one is the higher horizontal resolution we use 10 and 5 km see above compared to the original 25 km the second one is that following lliboutry and duval 1985 we employ a water content dependent rate factor at for temperate ice at w a 0 c 1 1 8125 w 14 where a 0 c 4 529 10 24 s 1 pa 3 is the rate factor for 0 c relative to pressure melting that results from the original eismint set up 4 2 eismint experiment a 2 the set up of experiment a 2 is essentially the same as that of experiment a 1 however the water content dependent rate factor 14 is not used instead the original eismint set up is used which only considers the dependence of the rate factor on temperature physically this means that the lubrication effect through enhanced shear of the near basal temperate ice due to its water content is ignored 4 3 eismint experiment h 1 experiment h 1 replaces the no slip condition of a 1 by basal sliding otherwise the set up is the same the sliding law is most simple and relates the sliding velocity linearly to the basal drag in the original experiment h the sliding parameter has the value 10 3 m a 1 pa 1 however this does not produce any basal temperate layers except for the cold scheme due to the strong downward advection of cold surface ice since we want to focus on the temperate ice we decided to use a modified set up with the sliding parameter reduced by a factor 10 to the value c 0 b 10 4 m a 1 pa 1 further in the eismint set up basal sliding is assumed to occur wherever the ice base is at the pressure melting point while for a cold base no slip conditions prevail however when used with the shallow ice approximation that is employed by sicopolis this binary switch is known to produce a singularity of the vertical velocity field that prohibits proper convergence of the numerical solution bueler and brown 2009 in order to circumvent this problem we regularize the transition by allowing for sub melt sliding in the form by greve 2005 originally proposed by hindmarsh and le meur 2001 2 the sliding parameter cb depends on the basal temperature t b in c relative to pressure melting via cb c 0 b exp t b 15 where 1 c is the sub melt sliding parameter equation 15 has the effect that rather than stopping abruptly basal sliding decays exponentially as the basal temperature falls below the pressure melting point 5 results for experiment a 1 run with the polythermal two layer poly scheme and the parameters x 10 km t 2 a fig 1 depicts the simulated steady state ice thickness surface topography at the end of the simulation t 200 ka the ice sheet reaches a volume of 2 109 106 km 3 covers an area of 1 046 106 km 2 and reaches a maximum thickness of 3 687 km the melt fraction fraction of basal ice at the pressure melting point is 67 5 for the same set up fig 2 shows four steady state temperature profiles at t 200 ka in the bottom most 80 m of the ice they are all located near the margin 520 km away from the center where the largest thicknesses of the temperate layer occur the positions of the profiles are indicated in fig 1 the profiles show the typical patterns of the four different schemes concerning the position of the cts how they match the transition conditions at the cts and the influence of the discrete grid evidently the poly scheme produces the best solutions the computed temperature profiles are both continuous and smooth across the cts thus fulfilling the transitions conditions for melting conditions this justifies our decision already stated in the last paragraph of the introduction to use the solutions computed with the poly scheme as a reference to assess the performance of the other three schemes 2 an alternative way of regularizing the singularity at the spatial onset of basal sliding is to replace the shallow ice stress balance by a higher order one including membrane stresses such as the first order approximation blatter 1995 or a shallow ice shelfy

6 km away 112 112 523 3 km away in the depicted four profiles the cold scheme overestimates the thickness of the temperate layer by a factor 3 5 this overestimation which was already reported by greve 1997 b for simulations of the greenland ice sheet with the sicopolis model is paralleled by a violation of the transition condition 4 the temperature gradient across the cts is not continuous most pronounced in fig 2 c the profiles obtained with the entc scheme also overestimate the thickness of the temperate layer but to a lesser extent than the cold ice method factor 1 5 2 like for the cold scheme the transition condition 4 or its equivalent enthalpy form eq 13 is not fulfilled at the cts the temperate layer thicknesses found by the entm scheme are most similar to those produced by the poly scheme further the temperature profiles all show a continuous gradient across the cts that is they fulfill the transition condition 4 or the equivalent form 13 however the price to pay for its enforcement by the corrector step described in sect 3 4 is that the temperature itself shows a slight discontinuity of 0 02 0 03 k ultimately this results from the fact that in a one layer scheme the positioning of the cts is naturally limited by the grid resolution while in the two layer poly scheme arbitrary precision can be achieved comparing the temperature profiles in the cold ice layer above the cts shows that despite the differences in the position of the cts the results produced by the poly entm and entc schemes are very close to each other in detail for all four profiles the entm scheme is slightly warmer while the entc scheme is slightly colder than the poly scheme by contrast the cold scheme produces notably 0 4 k higher temperatures for the poly entm and entc schemes the majority of grid points within the temperate layer reach a water content of w wmax 0 01 which is the prescribed threshold value of the simple drainage model see the last paragraph of sect 2 1 therefore we refrain from showing the water content in a separate figure the cold scheme is an exception because it does not account for any water content in other words the water content is zero everywhere in the following we focus on the volume and thickness distribution of the simulated temperate ice layers this is because a the thermal conditions at and near the ice base where most of the shearing takes place are most relevant for ice flow and b within the temperate ice the water content usually reaches the value wmax 0 01 see above figure 3 shows the evolution of the temperate ice

the horizontal lines mark the cts positions which most of the changes take place for all shown cases the temperate ice volume starts forming 6 7 ka after the initiation of the ice sheet build up goes through a weak maximum and then converges towards a steady state value the main difference between the larger 20 a panel a and the smaller 2 a panel b time step is the behavior of the cold scheme compared to the poly scheme for t 20 a it overpredicts the temperate ice volume by more than a factor 6 while for t 2 a the overprediction factor is 4 the results of the poly entm and entc schemes do not change much entc produces 2 more and entm 1 4 more temperate ice than poly employing the high vertical resolution panel c reduces the discrepancy between the poly and entm schemes to less than 10 and the overprediction by the entc scheme to a factor 1 4 while there is little influence on the poor performance of the cold scheme for both time steps and the standard vertical resolution panels a b the entc and entm schemes show some high frequency noise in the evolution of the temperate ice volume amplitudes less than 2 of the total temperate ice volume while the results produced by the poly scheme and the cold scheme are smoother the noisiness is clearly reduced but still visible for the high vertical resolution panel c this makes the one layer approach of entc and entm with its positioning of the cts at a discrete grid point uppermost grid point of the temperate layer see sects 3 3 and 3 4 a likely cause however the one dimensional simulations carried out by blatter and greve 2015 for a parallel sided slab did not show any noise so that its occurrence it also related to the three dimensionality of the problem considered here see below figures 4 6 show maps of the steady state thickness of the temperate layer for experiment a 1 all four thermo dynamics solvers and the same set ups as in fig 3 the decreasing amount of temperate ice in the order cold entc entm poly is clearly visible the larger time step in fig 4 compared to fig 5 mainly affects the results of the poly and cold schemes for the cold scheme this was already discussed above for the poly scheme

above finds its counterpart in larger spatial noise compare the respective panels c and d to a and b the two types of noise are strongly related to each other both are largely unaffected by the time step fig 5 vs fig 4 but significantly reduced by the higher vertical resolution fig 6 vs fig 5 for the small time step high vertical resolution set up used in fig 6 the results of the poly and entm schemes are very similar to each other further in all cases the thickness of the temperate layer tends to increase gradually with distance from the center of the ice sheet and then decreases sharply near the ice margin this confirms for our new simulations what was already claimed in sect 1 and it is the reason for the fact that freezing conditions at the cts can hardly be resolved thus justifying that we ignored them for this study owing to the incompatible symmetries of the ice sheet geometry circularly symmetric and the numerical grid aligned to the x and y axes the thin rings of largest temperate layer thicknesses near the margin are in all cases somewhat discontinuous a synopsis of the main results of the 16 set ups of experiment a 1 all set ups shown in figs 4 6 plus the high horizontal resolution case x 5 km t 2 a is given in table 1 the volume of temperate ice is in the range of 0 25 1 of the total ice volume and as discussed above varies strongly across the different thermodynamics schemes by contrast the melt fraction area ratio of basal temperate ice to total ice is much larger 2 3 and varies very little across all 16 set ups for the total ice volume and area the strongest systematic but still small influence arises from the horizontal resolution on average x 5 km produces an ice sheet with 0 7 more volume and 0 5 more area than x 10 km by contrast the influences of the thermodynamics solver the time step and the vertical resolution are unsystematic and even smaller in table 2 the computing times of the four thermodynamics schemes are compared for experiment a 1 with x 10 km and t 2 a the differences between the schemes are significant as expected the most simple but physically inadequate cold scheme is by far the fastest with a gain of more than 40 compared to the poly scheme the differences between the poly entm and entc schemes are smaller entc is about 10 faster than poly while entm is about 6 slower the reason for the relative slowness of the enthalpy schemes despite greater simplicity compared to the poly scheme is that in the sicopolis implementation in each time step the computed enthalpy field is converted back to temperature and water content this must be done three dimensionally and is thus costly codes that are designed as enthalpy based from the outset whereas the thermodynamics of sicopolis is natively based on temperature and water content can probably avoid these conversions which opens the possibility for greater efficiency of the enthalpy schemes 10 figure 4 eismint experiment a 1 thickness of

point see sect 3 for the scheme codes for experiment a 2 the water content dependent rate factor for temperate ice has been replaced by a constant rate factor like in the original eismint set up sect 4 2 the resulting steady state thickness of the temperate layer for all four thermodynamics solvers and the combination x 10 km t 2 a is shown in fig 7 and an overview of the main results is given in table 3 the cold scheme is unaffected by the difference between experiments a 1 and a 2 because it does not account for any water content and consequently the results are the same by contrast the poly entm and entc schemes produce roughly two times thicker temperate ice layers for experiment a 2 the reason is that the simulated temperate ice is stiffer which reduces the advective transport of cold ice towards the base so that the growth of the temperate ice layers is favored compared to experiment a 1 it is interesting to note that for experiment a 2 the temperate ice volumes computed by the poly and entm schemes agree very well within 3 for the standard vertical resolution employed here for experiment a 1 a similarly close agreement is only achieved with the high vertical resolution see discussion above there is no notable influence of experiment a 2 on the melt fraction the total ice area is essentially unaffected as well while the total ice volume is systematically slightly on average 0 8 larger than in experiment a 1 we discussed above that for experiment a 1 the poly scheme with the large time step setting x 10 km t 20 a produces a temperate layer thickness that shows a waviness oriented diagonally to the x and y axes fig 4 a for experiment a 2 and x 10 km t 20 a this instability does not occur and the thickness of the temperate layer not shown is very similar to that obtained for the setting x 10 km t 2 a shown in fig 7 a hence the instability is linked to the enhanced fluidity in the temperate layer due to the water content dependent rate factor employed in experiment a 1 for experiment h 1 basal sliding over temperate and near temperate based areas has been added to the set up of experiment a 1 sect 4 3 like for experiment a 2 we only discuss the combination x 10 km t 2 a figure 8 depicts the steady state thickness of the temperate layer for the four thermodynamics solvers and table 3 gives an overview of the results comparing figs 5 and 8 as well as the entries in table 3 reveals that the addition of some basal sliding reduces the volume of temperate ice strongly this is a consequence of increased advection of cold surface ice downward and outward and of reduced strain heating like for experiments a 1 and a 2 the computed temperate ice volume decreases in the order cold entc entm poly however even the entm scheme overpredicts the temperate ice volume by more than a factor 2 compared to the poly scheme this is because the thicknesses are so small that any one layer scheme does not resolve them well unless a very high vertical resolution is employed whereas the performance of the two layer poly scheme is not limited by this problem 17 figure 8 b shows further that in the distribution of temperate ice obtained with the cold scheme some spokes emerge the spokes are also present in similar form in the results of the three other schemes when the basal tempera ture is plotted instead of the thickness of the temperate ice layer not shown this phenomenon was already observed in the original article on the eismint phase 2 simplified geometry experiments payne and others 2000 it is most likely a consequence of the combined effects of a thermoviscous flow instability and the symmetry of the numerical grid bueler and others 2007 since the sliding coefficient in experiment h 1 is small the melt fraction and the total ice volume only decrease slightly compared to those of experiment a 1 and the ice area is virtually unchanged this underlines the very high sensitivity of the temperate ice layer to changed flow conditions for the original experiment h with a 10 times larger sliding coefficient results not shown the large scale response of the ice sheet is more pronounced for this scenario only the cold scheme produces a temperate layer of non zero thickness while the other schemes merely produce a temperate base 6 discussion and conclusion we tested four different thermodynamics solvers in the ice sheet model sicopolis two of them are the pre viously existing polythermal two layer poly and cold ice cold schemes while the other two are the newly implemented conventional one layer enthalpy entc and melting cts one layer enthalpy entm schemes the entc scheme goes back to the study by aschwanden and others 2012 while the entm scheme was introduced by blatter and greve 2015 for a one dimensional ice slab extension to the full three dimensional problem was straightforward because due to the neglect of horizontal diffusive heat fluxes the computation of the thermodynamic fields temperature and water content or enthalpy is essentially one dimensional for each column horizontal advec tion merely plays the role of an additional source term for the vertical profiles and does not constitute a problem for the implementation of the scheme we used two scenarios from the suite of eismint european ice sheet modeling initiative phase 2 simplified geometry experiments payne and others 2000 as our model problems one without and one with basal sliding like in the one dimensional study carried out by blatter and greve 2015 the results computed with the poly scheme were assessed to be most reliable and thus chosen as a reference as it was already reported by greve 1997 b the cold scheme strongly overpredicts thicknesses of temperate ice layers and thus temperate ice volumes choosing a small time step reduces the amount of overprediction to a certain extent but the performance of the cold scheme which is not energy conserving and thus physically incorrect anyway is not satisfactory the studies by kleiner and others 2015 and blatter and greve 2015 both carried out for a canadian type parallel sided slab found that the entc scheme even though it does not enforce the transition conditions at the cts explicitly still fulfills them for the case of melting conditions continuity of the enthalpy and the sensible heat flux provided that the discontinuity of the enthalpy diffusivity 11 at the cts is properly accounted for in the discretization of the diffusion term in the enthalpy equation 10 this could not be confirmed in the present study even though the entc scheme has been implemented in sicopolis in the same way as described by blatter and greve 2015 the scheme fails to produce a continuous temperature gradient across the cts and overpredicts temperate ice layer thicknesses albeit to a smaller degree than the cold scheme always compared to the references provided by the poly scheme we speculate that this is a consequence of the three dimensionality of the problem investigated here most likely due to the additional horizontal advection terms in the enthalpy equation in contrast to the entc scheme the continuity of the temperature gradient across the cts is explicitly enforced by the entm scheme this leads to a better match of computed temperate ice layer thicknesses to those computed by the poly scheme however some overprediction remains the price to pay for enforcing a continuous temperature gradient across the cts while the positioning of the cts is limited by the grid resolution is a slight discontinuity of the ice temperature itself when comparing the temperature profiles in the ice column above the cts the entc and entm schemes both perform well compared to the poly scheme while the temperatures produced by the cold scheme are too high the water content in the temperate ice layer below the cts usually reaches the threshold value of 0 01 1 for the poly entc and entm schemes while the cold scheme does not compute any water content 18 for large time steps in conjunction with a water content dependent rate factor the poly scheme can produce a wavy distribution of the temperate layer thickness therefore some care is required to choose a sufficiently small time step to avoid this instability however in contrast to the academic eismint application considered here real world applications require small time steps for overall numerical stability anyway at 10 km horizontal resolution greenland simulations with sicopolis typically require time steps of 1 a and antarctica simulations with coupled sheet shelf dynamics even smaller ones so this instability is most likely not a matter of concern for most practical applications with complex topographies the entc and entm schemes produce some temporal and spatial noise for the volume and thickness of the temperate ice this does not happen for the poly and cold schemes it is related to the one layer approach in which we position the cts at the uppermost grid point in the temperate layer whereas the poly scheme allows in principle tracking the position of the cts to arbitrary accuracy a possible improvement of the one layer enthalpy schemes would be to implement a sub grid tracking of the cts position which would likely allow to fulfill the continuity of the temperate and of the temperature gradient across the cts simultaneously and reduce the noise however such a sub grid tracking scheme will inevitably increase the computational cost to sum up for a polythermal ice sheet model the one layer enthalpy schemes entc and entm are viable easier to implement alternatives to the poly scheme with its slightly awkward need to handle two different numerical domains for cold and temperate ice entm is more precise than entc for determining the position of the cts and thus the volume and thickness of the temperate ice layer the performance of both schemes is good for the temperature profiles in the cold ice column above the cts and also the water content in the temperate ice layer below the cts the computing times of all three schemes are comparable acknowledgments we thank the two anonymous reviewers and the scientific editor t kameda for their comments
