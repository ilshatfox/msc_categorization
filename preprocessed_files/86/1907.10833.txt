microsoft word paper vamaraju 2017 docx finite difference based wave simulation in fractured porous rocks janaki vamaraju department of geological sciences the university of texas at austin abstract biot s theory provides a framework for computing seismic wavefields in fluid saturated porous media here we implement a velocity stress staggered grid 2 d finite difference algorithm to model the wave propagation in poroelastic media the biot s equations of motion are formulated using a finite difference algorithm with fourth order accuracy in space and second order accuracy in time seismic wave propagation in reservoir rocks is also strongly affected by fractures and faults we next derive the equivalent media model for fractured porous rocks using the linear slip model and perform numerical simulations in the presence of fractured interfaces as predicted by biot s theory a slow compressional wave is observed in the particle velocity snapshots in the layered model at the boundary the slow p wave converts to a p wave that travels faster than the slow p wave we finally conclude by commenting on the major details of our results introduction wave propagation in porous media is of interest in various diversified areas of science and engineering the theory of the phenomenon has been studied extensively in soil mechanics seismology acoustics earthquake engineering ocean engineering geophysics and many other disciplines particularly in reservoir geophysics ultrasonic and seismic modeling in porous media is used to study the properties of rocks and characterize the seismic response of geological formations seismic survey is a powerful tool to find potential locations of new oil and gas janaki vamaraju janaki vamaraju and mrinal k sen seismic modeling of poroelastic wave equations reservoirs and to monitor existing reservoirs seismic waves contain essential information on subsurface properties to quantify the dependence between wave propagation characteristics and subsurface properties related to porous medium various models have been proposed in literature the commonly used equations for wave propagation in poroelastic solids are biot s equations biot 1956 a b 1962 a macroscopic description of fluid filled porous media was developed by gassmann 1951 and biot 1941 1956 biot established the fundamental theory for wave propagation in fluid saturated porous media it is still well accepted and forms the basis for wave propagation studies in porous media the theory successfully predicted the existence of the second compressional wave the slow compressional wave which had been observed in the laboratory plona 1980 berryman 1980 for numerical simulation of wave propagation in general heterogeneous poroelastic media the finite difference method is probably the most widely used technique zhu and mcmechan 1991 dai et al 1995 jianfeng 1999 pride et al 2004 masson et al 2006 sheen et al 2006 masson and pride 2007 to introduce the classical pml in this method in the case of elastic media the wave equation usually is formulated as a first order system in time based on velocity and stress collino and tsogka 2001 in this study we use a velocity stress finite difference algorithm with pml absorbing boundaries to model the wave propagation in the porous media this algorithm is fourth order accurate in space and second order accurate in time further fractured reservoirs have attracted increasing attention in the research of exploration and production geophysics further wave studies are needed to reveal the physics of wave propagation in such a fracture pore system which is meaningful to the application in exploration activities subsurface fractures can vary in size from microcracks to large faults and strongly influence seismic wave propagation by causing wave scattering and anisotropy crampin 1977 seismic modeling of poroelastic wave equations 1981 in this report we adopt an equivalent model qizhen et al 2011 based on the linear slip theory nakagawa and schoenberg 2007 to describe the fractured porous media at seismic frequency bands and simulate wave propagation in fractured porous media in the following sections we first briefly review biot s theory of poroelasticity and present the equivalent media model for fractured porous rocks we then perform numerical simulations both in fractured and non fractured porous media and show the analysis results we finally conclude by commenting on the major details of our results theory and method biot s theory of poroelasticity maurice biot established the theory of poroelasticity in early fifties he made the following assumptions to derive the equations of motion in the porous media 1 the rock frame is assumed to be elastic 2 the pores are connected so that the fluid could travel through the pore space 3 the seismic wavelength is much larger than the average pore size 4 the deformations are so small that the mechanical processes become linear 5 the medium is statistically isotropic zhu and mcmechan 1991 although biot extended his theory to more general cases such as anisotropic porous media in this report we concentrate on the isotropic case from the stress strain relation for a porous medium biot 1962 the solid stress and the pore fluid pressure p are given by 2 1 2 where 8 9 is the solid strain with being the particle velocity of the solid and where is the particle displacement of the fluid is the shear seismic modeling of poroelastic wave equations modulus and is the lame parameter of the saturated rock is defined by 1 abcd aefg h where jkl m and nop are the bulk moduli of the solid and the dry rock frame respectively is coupling modulus defined by q args h tuq aefg h with vl m being the bulk modulus of the fluid inserting the particle displacement vector of the fluid relative to the solid y and are the fluid and saturated rock densities and is the fluid mobility defined by with being the viscosity of the fluid and being the permeability of the porous rock q is the effective density of the fluid with t being the tortuosity defining the solid and relative particle velocities b and d b these equations could be written

propagation in poroelastic media equations 3 to 6 need to be discretized using the finite difference algorithm the unknowns are the solid stresses oo o the fluid pressure the solid particle velocities and o and the relative fluid particle velocities and for more accuracy a velocity stress staggered grid finite difference scheme was used for numerical modeling the solid stresses and the fluid pressure are seismic modeling of poroelastic wave equations calculated on the regular grid whereas other unknowns are calculated on the staggered grid where the grid points are shifted by half a grid

vertical velocities by z and shear stress by o equivalent medium model for fractured porous rocks in the linear slip model nakagawa and schoenberg 2007 the stress field and the pressure field is assumed to be continuous across the fracture whereas the displacement field is assumed to be discontinuous the jump in the displacement is linearly related to the traction vector at the fracture as follows p o 7 o qm oo 8 o o t 9 where p is the shear compliance qm is the dry normal compliance and t is the fluid mineral compliance of the fracture using this model q du et al 2011 derived the equivalent medium model for vertical fractures we shall adopt this model for the simulations in this report results and discussion homogeneous isotropic model without fractures we first simulate the poroelastic wave equations in a homogeneous isotropic medium a ricker wavelet was used as an explosive source to inject an explosive source the wavelet is added to the normal solid stresses and fluid pressure the size of the model is 2 km by 2 km the source is seismic modeling of poroelastic wave equations located at the position x z 1 0 1 0 km with a dominant frequency of 40 hz the recorders are located at 600 m depth grid spacing dx dz 2 m and time step dt 0 2 ms the properties of the medium are shown in table 1 the calculated snapshots for the vertical particle velocities of the solid and relative fluid with respect to solid are show in figure 2 two p waves traveling in the medium can be seen where the slow p wave travels with a speed close to the wave speed in the fluid the particle velocity of the slow p wave in the solid is out of phase with the one in the fluid in contrast for the fast p wave the particle velocities are in phase in the solid and fluid figure 3 also shows the fluid pressure snapshots for this model the slow p wave has a larger relative amplitude than the fast p wave which is because the slow p wave is originated from the fluid movement vertical and horizontal velocity shot gathers are also plotted below as observed from the snapshots the slow p wave can also be seen in the poroelastic shot gather figure 2 vertical velocity snapshots of the solid top and relative fluid with respect to the solid bottom at t 012 s 0 32 s table 1 properties of the homogeneous medium seismic modeling of poroelastic wave equations figure 4 vertical and horizontal velocity traces for the homogeneous medium homogeneous isotropic model with a vertical fault we repeat the previous experiment with a vertical fault line at x 1 km the source is located at the position x z 0 5 0 5 km with a dominant frequency of 40 hz the recorders are located at 100 m depth the fault has the properties shown below snapshots and shot gathers similar to the previous example are shown in figures 5 6 the results show that the linear slip discontinuity generates reflected and transmitted fast p and s waves with their corresponding head waves the reflected slow wave dissipates very quickly and hence cannot be seen figure 3 pressure field snapshots at t 0 12 s and 0 22 s seismic modeling of poroelastic wave equations figure 5 pressure field and vertical solid velocity snapshots at t 0 21 and t 0 46 s figure 6 horizontal and vertical velocity traces for homogeneous medium with vertical fault line heterogeneous 2 layer model the next example we use to study is a 2 layer heterogeneous model properties of the first layer are given in table 2 for the second layer we use the same properties as in the first example for a homogeneous medium both the layers have 1 km depth the source is located at the position x z 1 0 0 75 km with a dominant frequency of 40 hz the recorders are located at 500 m depth particle velocity snapshot is shown in figure 7 the shot gather is also plotted in figure 8 seismic modeling of poroelastic wave equations we see several wave modes including the converted waves pf and ps are the fast and the slow p waves respectively pff is the reflected fast p wave pss is the reflected slow p wave and pfs is the reflected s wave that is converted from a fast p wave a reflected fast p wave which is converted from the slow p wave is also evident in this figure this wave which is marked as psf travels faster than the reflected slow p wave table 2 properties of the upper layer in the 2 layer model figure 8 vertical velocity shot gather for the 2 layer model figure 7 vertical solid velocity snapshot at t 0 34 s seismic modeling of poroelastic wave equations conclusions biot s poroelastic wave equations were modeling using a velocity stress staggered grid finite difference algorithm we performed simulations both in fractured and non fractured media using the linear slip theory in the former case as predicted by biot s theory two compressional waves appeared in the snapshots of the particle velocities along with the converted waves due to the fault line a 2 layered model was also simulated to see the wave behavior at a boundary the vertical velocity snapshots showed different wave modes generated at the interface including a fast p wave which is converted from the slow p wave this poroelastic fd algorithm has the potential to be used for full waveform inversion to obtain porous media properties that are ignored in elastic wave equation algorithms references berryman j g 1980 confirmation of biot s theory
