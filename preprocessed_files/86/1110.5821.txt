objective of this article is to study the effect of spherical geometry on dynamic transitions and pattern formation for the rayleigh be nard convection the study is mainly motivated by the importance of spherical geometry and convection in geophysical flows it is shown in particular that the system always undergoes a continuous type i transition to a 2 lc dimensional sphere s 2 lc where lc is the critical wave length corresponding to the critical rayleigh number furthermore it has shown in 12 that it is critical to add nonisotropic turbulent friction terms in the momentum equation to capture the large scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns we show in particular that the system with turbulent friction terms added undergoes the same type of dynamic transition and obtain an explicit formula linking the critical wave number pattern selection the aspect ratio and the ratio between the horizontal and vertical turbulent friction coefficients contents 1 introduction 1 2

convection plays an important role in the large scale atmospheric and oceanic circulations the phenomena of the atmosphere and ocean are extremely rich in their organization and complexity and involve a broad range of temporal and spatial scales 3 to avoid to deal with the atmosphere and ocean in all their complexity the main focus of this article is to study the be nard convection on spherical shells to capture the main effects caused by the spherical geometry second over the years the rayleigh be nard convection problem together with the taylor problem has become one of the paradigms for studying nonequilibrium phase key words and phrases rayleigh be nard convection on spherical shells dynamic transition center manifold reduction spherical harmonics pattern formation the work was supported in part by the us office of naval research and by the us national science foundation 1 http arxiv org abs 1110 5821 v 1 2 wang and yang transitions and pattern formation in nonlinear sciences see among others busse 1 chandrasekhar 2 cross 4 ma and wang 13 and the references therein for the euclidean domain case a systematic study on dynamic transition of the rayleigh be nard convection is carried out in ma and wang 9 11 the main result in this direction is that the system always undergoes a type i continuous transition as the instability driving mechanism namely rayleigh number crosses a critical threshold rc thanks to the symmetry of the linear operator properties of the nonlinearity and asymptotic stability of the basic state at the critical threshold moreover the system has a bifurcated attractor which is an m 1 dimensional homological sphere where m is the number of critical eigenvalues of the linear operator in this article we consider a fluid which occupies a layer of spherical shell modeled by the boussinesq equations namely the density function is treated as a constant except in the equation of state and in the buoyancy term for simplicity the spatial geometry of the domain is taken as the product of a two dimensional sphere s 2 a with radius a and an interval s 2 a 0 h where h is the height of the fluid layer this is mainly motivated by the fact that aspect ratio for the large scale atmosphere and ocean is small see among others 7 8 14 as in the euclidean case in the spherical shell case we show that the system is always undergoes a type i continuous dynamic transition to a 2 lc dimensional homological sphere r where lc is the critical wave number determined by 1 1 1 h a 2 lc lc 1 2 2 an important part of this article is to show that 2 lc dimensional homological sphere r is in fact homeomorphic to a 2 lc dimensional sphere s 2 lc this is achieved by carrying out the reduction of the original boussinesq equations to the center manifold generated by the first 2 lc 1 modes the main difficulty comes then from the nontrivial nonlinear interactions of the spherical harmonics both scalar and vectorial the remaining part of this article is devoted to the introduction of the turbulent friction terms in the boussinesq equations this is crucial for capturing the large scale convection patterns in the large scale geophysical flows as demonstrated in thermohaline circulation studies by ma and wang 12 the friction terms are added based on the convection scale considerations as introduced in 12 and are given by 0 u 1 w see 6 1 under the assumption that 1 0 1 the corresponding critical wave number lc is approximately given by 1 2 h a 2 lc lc 1 2 2 0 1 1 2 as we know for the large scale atmospheric and oceanic circulations the critical wave number lc is often relatively small e g lc 6 for the global walker circulation over the tropics hence the small aspect ratio h a is then balanced by the smallness of the ratio 0 1 between the horizontal and vertical turbulent friction coefficients leading to moderated size of the critical wave numbers it is worth mentioning that with the framework given in this article one can study the humid ity salinity effects of the large scale atmospheric and oceanic flows as well as the rotational effect coriolis force of the earth we shall report this elsewhere 1 the integer lc is to make the left hand side the closet to the right hand side remarks on the rayleigh be nard convection on spherical shells 3 the article is organized as follows section 2 introduces the boussinesq equations on the spherical shell and the linear stability analysis is carried in section 3 sections 3 and 4 are on dynamic transitions and the structure of the bifurcated attractor section 6 demonstrates the need to introduction of convection scales and studies the dynamics transitions for the boussinesq equations with the added friction terms 2 boussinesq equations we start with the prototype of problem the be nard convection problem for a layer of fluid in a spherical shell we consider the case where the fluid can be modeled by the boussinesq equations namely the density is considered as constant except in the buoyancy term and in the equation of state the equations are given as follows 2 1 ut u 3 u 3 u 10 3 p g k 1 t t 0 tt u 3 t 3 t 0 div 3 u 0 here the unknown functions are velocity field u u 1 u 2 u 3 the temperature function t and the pressure function p other parameters include is the kinematic viscosity k 0 0 1 is the unit vector in the vertical direction g is the gravity constant is coefficient of thermal expansion of the fluid t 0 is temperature on the lower surface 0 is the density is he thermal diffusivity for simplicity we consider the spherical domain as d s 2 a 0 h where s 2 a is the two dimensional sphere with radius and h is the height of the fluid layer the motion for this type of geometry is due to the study of large scale geophysical fluid flows where the aspect ratio and the thin layer of spherical shell can be approximated by d given here it s easy to get the basic solution u t 0 t 0 x 3 p p 0 0 g x 3 2 x 23 where t 0 t 1 h r a h and t 1 is temperature on the upper surface mathematically speaking it is convenient to introduce the nondimensional form of the equation for this purpose let x t hx h 2 t u t u h h t r t 0 hx 3 p 0 2 p h 2 p 0 g 0 hx 3 h 2 2 x 3 2 in addition the rayleigh number r and the prandtl number pr are defined by r g pr 4 wang and yang the nondimensional domain is s 2 r 0 1 and it s reasonable to use the spherical coordinates let u w be the 3 dimensional velocity u be the horizontal velocity field and w be the vertical velocity also the following notations div are differential operators in the horizontal direction then the system 2 1 can be written as 2 2 1 pr ut uu w u z p 2 z 2 u 0 1 pr wt uw w w z p z 2 z 2 w rt 0 tt ut w w z rw 2 z 2 t 0 divu w z 0 supplemented with the following free slip boundary condition 2 3 w 0 t 0 u z 0 at z 0 1 it is worth mentioning that we can also study other physically sound boundary conditions such as the non slip boundary or the periodic boundary conditions the following are some differential operators at spherical coordinates on s 2 r t 1 r f e 1 r sin f e curlt 1 r sin f e 1 r f e uv 1 r u v u sin v u v cot e 1 r u v u sin v u v cot

the function spaces as 2 4 h u w t l 2 4 divu 0 w t 0 at z 0 1 h 1 u w t h 2 4 divu 0 w t 0 u z 0 at z 0 1 let l h 1 h and g h 1 h be defined by remarks on the rayleigh be nard convection on spherical

the following operator form 2 6 t l g 0 for t 0 here 0 h is the initial condition it is then classical to prove the existence and properties of solutions see 6 8 we omit the details here 3 linear analysis and principle of exchange of stability to study the dynamic transitions of the be nad convection problem 2 2 on the spherical shells we need to consider the linear eigenvalue problem 3 1 l which is equivalent to 3 2 pr 2 z 2 u p u pr 2 z 2 w pr t p z w 2 z 2 t w t div 3 u w 0 supplemented with the boundary condition 2 3 when u w t doesn t depend on vertical z then we have w t 0 and u curlyl m so the eigenvalue and eigenfunctions are as follows 3 3 l 0 pr 2 l lm 0 curlylm 0 0 6 wang and yang thanks to the spherical geometry of the domain the above eigenvalue problem can solved using the following separation of variables 3 4 u f h z w 2 f h z t f z by 3 4 we infer from 3 2 and 6 2 that f 2 f 3 5 pr 2 fh fh p fh 3 6 pr 4 fh 2 fh f p z 2 fh 3 7 2 f f 2 fh f 3 8 h h 0 at z 0 1 3 9 for the eigenvalue problem 3 5 on the 2 d sphere the only possible candidates for the eigenfunction and eigenvalues are given by f ylm 3 10 2 l l l 1 r 2 3 11 to eliminate the pressure function p we do 3 6 z 3 7 3 12 prh 2 pr 2 h 4 pr 2 h pr then we can consider two cases first for the case where l 0 it is easy to see that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of l are 3 13 0 n n 2 2 00 n 0 0 sinn z when l 6 0 plug 3 12 into equation 3 8 then h are as follows hn sinn z 3 14 n bln sinn z 3 15 then plugging 3 14 and 3 15 into 3 12 and 3 8 we obtain that bln 2 l ln 2 ln pr 4 ln 2 ln pr 3 16 where 2 ln n 2 2 2 l n 2 2 l l 1 r 2 from 3 16 the eigenvalue solves the following quadratic equation 2 1 pr 2 ln 4 ln 2 2 l 2 ln pr 0 remarks on the rayleigh be nard convection on spherical shells 7 we get two types of eigenvalues and eigenvectors 3 17 ln 1 2 2 ln 1 pr 4 ln 1 pr 2 4 pr 4 ln 2 2 l 2 ln 1 2 lmn n cosn z ylm 2 l ylm sinn z 2 l ln 2 ln ylm sinn z ln 1 2 2 ln 1 pr 4 ln 1 pr 2 4 pr 4 ln 2 2 l

group which is shown in 3 3 3 13 and 3 17 now we define the critical rayleigh number rc 2 c by 3 18 c min l n n 2 2 2 l 3 2 l min l 2 2 l 3 2 l it is easy to see that the minimum in the above formula is c is achieved at 2 lc by definition we have see 1 2 3 19 h a 2 lc lc 1 2 2 as l can only take integer values it is possible for the minimum in 3 18 is achieved at two consecutive l s for simplicity and without loss of generality in this article we only consider the case where the minimum is achieved at lc with an integer lc 3 20 c 2 2 lc 3 2 lc 3 3 2 2 with lc lc lc 1 r 2 and the critical rayleigh number is 3 21 rc 2 c 27 4 4 657 5 this value is consistent with the value developed classically see among many others 2 5 by definition the following principle of exchange of stability pes holds true lc 1 0 if c 0 if c 0 if c ln c 0 l n 6 lc 1 l n 0 ln c 0 l n l n 0 l 0 c 0 l 0 0 n c 0 n 0 the critical eigenspace is then given by 3 22 e 1 lc m lc xm lcm 1 x m 1 mx m xm c m lc 8 wang and yang with dimension dime 1 2 lc 1 4 dynamical transitions as mentioned in the introduction the linear operator l is symmetric leading to the real eigenvalues l n 0 n with the pes at our disposal we can obtain immediately that the be nard convection system will undergoes a dynamic transition and the following theorem shows that the transition is always type i theorem 4 1 the be nard convection problem 2 6 always undergoes a type i dynamic transition as the rayleigh number r crosses the critical value rc in particular the following assertions hold true 1 when r rc the basic motionless state with linear temperature profile u w t 0 is globally asymptotically stable 2 as r rc but near rc the problem bifurcates to an attractor r which is an 2 lc dimensional homological sphere where the integer lc is defined by 3 20 3 for any u w t r lc m 1 c xm lcm 1 o lc m lc xm x m 1 mx m xm c m lc 4 the attractor r attracts h where is the stable manifold of 0 with codimension 2 lc 1 5 the attractor r contains at least one steady state solution of the problem proof as in 9 we can show that the basic motionless state is globally asymptotically stable the critical eigenvalue c by the attractor bifurcation theorem in 10 and the linear analysis in the previous subsection we obtain immediately assertions 1 4 in the theorem it suffices then to show the existence of at least one steady state in the bifurcated attractor r to this end the steady state problem for 2 6 can be written as 4 1 a b g where a b l and the linear operator a and b are defined by 4 2 a p pr 2 z 2 u pr 2 z 2 w 2 z 2 t b p 0 pr t w u w t h 1 obviously the operator a is invertible and 4 1 can be written as 4 3 id a 1 b a 1 g then it is classical to show that the linear operator id a 1 b h h is a completely continuous field and a 1 g h h is a compact operator hence by the krasnoselski bifurcation theorem see e g theorem 1 10 in 10 4 3 has a nontrivial steady state bifurcation at rc as the critical eigenvalue rc has odd multiplicity 2 lc 1 which is the dimension of the eigenspace e 1 the proof is complete remarks on the rayleigh be nard convection on spherical shells 9 5 structure and patterns of the be nard convection the above theorem shows that the system always undergoes a dynamic transition as r crosses the critical rayleigh number rc and the transition states occupy a set r homological to s 2 lc the main objective of this section is to derive more detailed structure of this bifurcated attractor in particular we shall give a strategy to show that r is in fact homeomorphic to s 2 lc the approach for this purpose is reduce the governing partial differential equations to the center manifold generated by the unstable modes for r rc and near rc as the general case is tedious and time consuming we present here only two special cases where critical wave number lc 1 or 2 the other cases can be studied in the same fashion theorem 5 1 consider the be nard convection in the case where lc 1 which is equivalent in the dimensional form to h a 2 where a is the horizontal length scale and h is the vertical scale then the bifurcated attractor r is homeomorphic to s 2 consisting of only degenerate steady states furthermore r is approximated by r 1 m 1 1 m 1 x m 1 mx m x 0 2 x 1 2 x 1 2 11 q 1 where q 1 is given by q 1 3 3 17787 355912 pr 669713 pr 2 387787 pr 3 400000 pr 353 625 pr 353 pr 2 namely for any r 1 m 1 xm 1 m 1 o 11 q 1 1 2 x 20 x 1 2 x 1 2 11 q 1 x m 1 mx m m 1 theorem 5 2 for the case where lc 2 equivalently h a 2 3 the bifurcated attractor r is homeomorphic to s 4 which consists of at least an s 2 subset of degenerate steady states furthermore when pr 1 r is approximated by r 2 m 2 2 m 2 x m 1 mx m 2 m 2 xm 2 21 q 2 where q 2 is given by q 2 2291405 3 214754176 the proof of these two theorems is based on the reduction of the original boussinesq equations to the center manifold generated by the first unstable modes and to study the dynamics of the reduced system as mentioned the same method applies to other cases as well 10 wang and yang proof of theorem 5 1 we proceed in several steps as follows step 1 general center manifold reduction stratege more precisely let e 1 x lc m lc xm lcm 1 x m 1 mx m xm c m lc e 2 e 1 the main idea of the center manifold function is to seek a function which maps a neighborhood of the original

approximated by 5 2 l x p 2 g x o 2 where p 2 h e 2 is the canonical projection and o 2 o x 2 o lc 1 x 2 the first term in the right hand side of 5 2 involves products of the eigenfunctions lcm 1 which are defined in terms of the spherical harmonics ylm with l lc hence by the properties of the 3 j symbols for the products of spherical harmonics we only have to calculate the following center manifold function coefficients and all the others are zero or of higher order 1 for 1 l 2 lc m l 5 3 ylm 0 g x lm 0 l 0 lm 0 2 o 2 2 for n 2 5 4 y 002 g x 002 02 002 2 o 2 3 for l 6 lc 1 l 2 lc m l and n 0 or 2 5 5 y lmn g x lmn ln lmn 2 o 2 4 for 1 l 2 lc m l and n 0 or 2 5 6 y lmn g x lmn ln lmn 2 o 2 we note that hand calculation of the right had sides of above formulas are still difficult if not impos sible fortunately one can write a simple mathematica program to perform symbolic calculations to derive precise formulas these coefficients finally the reduced equations are given as follows

side of this reduced equation we need to use mathematica as well step 2 approximation of the center manifold function for lc 1 in this case the first eigenvalue of 3 1 with 3 4 is 11 1 12 9 2 1 pr 81 4 1 pr 2 48 pr 2 using mathematica we infer from 5 3 5 6 that 5 8 y 2 22 x 1 22 d 1 x 2 1 y 2 22 x 1 22 d 1 x 2 1 y 2 12 x 1 22 2 d 1 x 1 x 0 y 2 12 x 1 22 2 d 1 x 1 x 0 y 202 x 1 22 3 2 d 1 x 2 0 x 1

where q 1 3 3 17787 355912 pr 669713 pr 2 387787 pr 3 400000 pr 353 625 pr 353 pr 2 o 3 o x 3 o lc 1 x 3 as the eigenfunction are complex we can set xm 1 2 ym izm ym zm r by definition see 3 22 we have ym 1 my m zm 1 m 1 z m m 0 hence we obtain the following reduced equations 5 11 dy 1 dt 11 y 1 q 1 y 1 x 20 y 21 z 21 o 3 dx 0 dt 11 x 0 q 1 x 0 x 20 y 21 z 21 o 3 dz 1 dt 11 z 1 q 1 z 1 x 2 0 y

bifurcated attractor r is homeomorphic to s 2 also by theorem 4 1 there is at least one steady state solution in r in addition due to the spherical geometry the original boussinesq equations have an s

equations 5 11 equal to zero we obtain that r is approximated by y 1 x 0 z 1 r 3 x 20 y 21 z 21 11 q 1 the proof is complete proof of theorem 5 2 we note that the unstable space e 1 is now given by e

1 x 0 z 1 z 2 r 5 x 20 y 21 z 21 y 22 z 22 21 q 2 and r contains at least an s 2 subset of steady state solutions we remark here that if we retain only the linear and cubic order terms in the above reduced equations 5 15 we would have the whole s 4 consisting only steady state solutions however since the steady states solutions are degenerate with zero jacobian there is no persistence and stability of these steady state solutions the proof of the theorem is complete 6 large scale circulations and turbulent frictions now we consider the following equations 6 1 1 pr ut uu w u z p 0 u 2 z

same results as theorems 4 1 5 1 and 5 2 hold true for the rayleigh be nard convection system 6 1 with added turbulent friction terms we omit the details it is worth however to remark that 6 5 provides a precise pattern selection mechanism in terms of the aspect ratio h a and the ratio between the horizontal and vertical friction coefficients for example for the circulation we can choose
