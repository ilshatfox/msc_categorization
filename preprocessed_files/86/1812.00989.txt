formation factors of the mariana trench fig 1 a long and narrow topographic depressions of the sea floor located in the west pacific ocean mariana trench is the deepest part of the ocean floor a distinctive morphological feature of the convergent plate boundaries along which lithospheric plates move towards each other located about 200 km parallel to a volcanic island arc karato et al 2001 figure 1 study area mariana trench a trench marks the position at which the subducting slab descends beneath another lithospheric slab deschamps and lallemand 2003 1 1 geology sedimentation thin quaternary clayey sediments overlie a 400 m thick alternating sequence of the early cretaceous quartz trachyte pillow lava and early to late cretaceous radiolarian cherts in the oceanward slope of the mariana trench hirano et al 2002 the sediment cover is less than 10 m thick and is composed of soft bedded clay with sand size ash fragments this clayey sediment covers a very gentle terrace 500 m wide curtis and moyer 2005 the turbidite currents are being generated on the outer shelf and upper continental slope due to the precipitation and transport via the submarine canyons to the axial part of the trench the speed of such sedimentation in the bottoms of trenches closely depends on the volumes of the incoming sediments ranging from 300 to 3000 mm thousand years ishizuka et al 2018 as a result of such sedimentation over one kilometer of sediments have accumulated in the southern aleutian and chilean trenches over the last several hundred thousand years on the bottom of the deep ocean trenches a longitudinal main channel is usually formed under the influence of turbidite currents pabst et al 2012 it creates favorable conditions for distinctive movements of the sand sediments that shape large elongated accumulations of the sediments ernst 2001 as a hadal trench mariana trench belongs to the one of the deepest 45 of the ocean s depth range and its unique topography disrupts the continental shelf slope rise to abyssal plain continuum resulting in an array of deep isolated habitats the often abrupt and distinct topography is likely to further promote speciation through high hydrostatic pressure remoteness from surface derived food sources and geographic isolation eustace et al 2016 1 2 geomorphology cracks mariana trench is notable for its well developed systems of cracks in the structure cracks of the mariana trench are abundantly developed at the edge of the terrace in the middle and upper part of the terrace heuret and lallemand 2005 the explanation of the formation of these cracks is besides gravitational instability that horizontal extension is due to the trench ward increase of the dip angle of the ocean floor surface and that this might cause slope instability due to gravity pull the cracks on the surface of the seabed on the oceanward slopes of the mariana trench are attributed to tensile rock failure induced by a combination of slope lemenkova turkish journal of maritime and marine sciences 4 2 146 155 148 instability and earthquake shaking schellart 2007 the cracks of the mariana trench are found on the horizontal or very gentle slopes just above steep cliffs and are mostly elongated in directions nearly parallel to the strike of the cliffs although some are aligned branching or merging have no vertical nor lateral displacement that could be explained by open tension fractures surface edges of the mariana trench cracks are generally very sharp indicating their young origin with a noticeable pressure ridge caused by mud overflow during closure of one crack the cracks were formed at the horizontally stretched surface of the down going subducting oceanic plate under tensional stress this tensional stress may have been caused by a combination of gravitational slope instability plus additional inertia during earthquake shaking which occurs close to these areas demets et al 1990 thus the cracks were formed at topographically specific areas where gravitational instability or instability occurs at the edges of the slope or top of the ridge ishizuka et al 2010 1 3 tectonics slab movement understanding the mechanisms of trench migration retreat or advance is crucial to characterizing the driving forces of earth s tectonics plates the origins of subducting slab morphologies in the deep mantle and identifying the characteristics of subduction zones systems which are among the fundamental issues of solid earth science yoshida 2017 recent studies revealed faccenna et al 2009 that mariana trench advance toward the upper plate corresponding to the subduction of very old mesozoic oceanic lithosphere the mariana arc lavas are relatively enriched in molybdenum mo and have 98 95 mo significantly greater than morb apart from the samples from the island of agrigan this implicates the addition of a mo rich fluid with 98 95 mo 0 05 to the mantle wedge beneath most islands freymuth et al 2015 recently updated analyses of global plate motions indicate that significant trench advance is also rare on earth being largely restricted to the marianas izu bonin arc c kov and bin 2015 the effects of trench migration on the descent of subducted slabs are discussed by griffiths et al 1995 the global plate tectonics movements shaping the seafloor bathymetry can be described as follows the seafloor spreading creates an axial rift and corrugated hills spreading ridges are formed by nearby faults where the most destructive earthquakes occur subduction of the cooled plate into the mantle causes creation of the deep ocean trenches and here as a consequence the major earthquakes and tsunamis originate the plates act as giant radiators of the heat cooling thickening and gradually subsiding by progressing from ridge to trench it explains the appearance of the double seismic zone beneath the mariana island arc samowitz and forsyth 1981 in such a way tectonic plates form the large scale pattern of the system of ridges and deep ocean basins the deformation of the upper plates as well as the surface migration of the ocean trenches of the pacific ocean are the prevailing observables of the dynamics of the inter parts of the plates as described in various research papers e g miller et al 2004 therefore the classification of the tectonic plate boundaries according to their cross correlation with the kinematical and geometrical properties of the plate boundaries should reflect their geodynamics various research papers have discussed a problem of the slab movement around the trench e g fujioka et al 2002 funiciello et al 2008 heuret et al 2012 lemenkova turkish journal of maritime and marine sciences 4 2 146 155 149 2 material and method 2 1 gis data processing the gis part of the research is performed in the qgis by creating 25 bathymetric profiles crossing mariana trench each profile has a length of 1000 km a distance gap of 100 km in between and 518 measurement points in each the total dataset comprises of large amount of 12950 observations figure 2 violin plots showing depth data distribution for observation points of the 25 bathymetric profiles of the mariana trench data includes tectonic plates topography of the profiles slope angle depths aspect class location of the igneous volcanic areas sediment thickness in the qgis several tasks were performed using thematic plugins e g coordinate re projecting the geospatial data have been uploaded to form the gis project bathymetric features sediment thickness location of the igneous volcanic zones multiple thematic layers were upload into the gis system that include among others marine geology data stores in layers settings coordinate system parameters etc the geometry of the profiles has been digitized along the mariana trench the attributes profiles names and coordinates have been entered every profile had a length of 1 000 km and the distance between each two neighbor profiles 100 km along the path of the trench the gis processing resulted in bathymetric 25 profiles the gis project has been re projected into the utm cartesian coordinate system square n 55 2 2 analysis of data distribution the violin plots fig 2 were created to show kernel probability density distribution of the bathymetric observations as multimodal distributions with multiple peaks kernel density distribution plot as shown on the fig 2 was created using library violinmplot of r in a combined plot which includes calculated quantiles for 0 25 and 0 75 of the data pool the kernel density estimation kde is a non parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable of the observation depth the kde has been performed by smoothing data points across the sample points in the profiles 1 25 of the mariana trench kernel density estimates can be endowed with properties such as smoothness or continuity of the bathymetric data by using a suitable kernel technically besides violinplot library a kernel density estimation function can be implemented in r through the density the bkde function in the kernsmooth library as well as through the kde function in the ks lemenkova turkish journal of maritime and marine sciences 4 2 146 155 150 library to use the kde r function it is not required to install any packages or libraries while violinplot package was installed and activated prior to the current work 2 3 factor analysis to perform factor analysis and principal component analysis an approach based on the use of r scripting was used fig 3 to this end the r libraries for scripting simulations were used aimed to model principal factors that affect the morphology of the trench figure 3 a programming script for factor analysis written on r code for the factor analysis the entire modeling process including grid generation model setup execution and analysis of the results with visualized correlation matrix showing the more important factors impacts according to their values has been carried out from a single r script with the results of the correlation matrix shown on fig 4 the standardized loadings based upon correlation matrix of factor analysis of the mariana trench fig 5 show the impact values of each factor for this research the fa function from r was used fig 3 which received the following primary arguments r the correlation matrix nfactors number of factors to be extracted rotate one of several matrix rotation methods such as varimax or oblimin fig 8 figure 4 correlation matrix of factors of the mariana trench r programming next an alternative to factor for the components analysis was performed using factominer library by cluster analysis iclust fig 9 this goal is the same as factor or components analysis but methodologically it reduces the complexity of the data and attempts to identify homogeneous sub groups here the exploratory factor analysis aims to extract a more regular impact factors of the geologic morphology development whereas cluster analysis and hierarchical dendrogram extract the groups and classes in a total cloud of the bathymetric observation points finally the factor analysis results in the illustrating cross influences of the most notable factors geological geomorphological tectonic geographic and environmental parameters lemenkova turkish journal of maritime and marine sciences 4 2 146 155 151 figure 5 standardized loadings based upon correlation matrix of factor analysis this enables to quantitatively analyze correlation between the actual shape of the trench and its environmental impact factors fig 6 fm one of several factoring methods such as pa principal axis or ml maximum likelihood as shown on the fig 3 figure 6 exploratory factor analysis the omega testing was done to find out two alternative estimates of the reliability that take into account the hierarchical structure of the inventory data are fig 10 and fig 11 these were called using the omega function for factor analysis r the computed coefficient omega hierarchical h is an estimate of the general factor saturation of the performed test various factoring methods have been tested in this research to better describe data factors nevertheless the fa function provided the best results used for common factoring fig 7 in this research the oblique rotation rotate oblimin has been used which recognizes that there is likely to be some correlation between geomorphological factors affecting mariana trench formation the principal axis factoring fm pa was used in this research as the identifying the underlying constructs in the data was not necessary in this case figure 7 parallel analysis scree plots the exploratory factor analysis efa matrix is shown on fig 8 finally the euler venn plot fig 12 has been drawn to visualize all possible crossings between the variables using venn library of r calling following script x list philippine mdf plate phill pacific mdf plate

class venn x ilabels true col navyblue zcolor style 3 results once all the cross section profiles had been inspected the assessment of the bathymetric observation points and other environmental parameters depth sediment thickness has been met by the factor analysis correlation matrix fig 8 figure 8 efa correlation matrix the factor loadings fig 5 enable to assess the results of the factor solutions thus we can see that the sediment thickness factor solution 0 65 slope angle steepness factor solution 0 61 and mariana plate location factor solution 0 74 have high factor loadings 0 5 around 0 7 on the first factor pa 1 therefore these factors are the most influencing and representative for the morphology of the trench the sediment thickness is mostly impacted by the slope steepness degree two geophysical indicators were particularly tested in the comparative analysis fig 5 it was furthermore found that slope degree and amplitude has important impact on the sediment thickness while the aspect degree has lesser effect secondly the second column pa 2 reveals fig 5 that calculated tg slope angle has a factor solution 0 98 extremely high following by depth distribution factor solution 0 76 figure 9 iclust analysis the location of the caroline and philippine plates do not affect that much mariana trench having negative factor solutions 0 79 and 0 70 respectively as well as a much lower loading on pa 2 factor solutions 0 25 and 0 12 and that it has a slight loading on factor pa 1 figure 10 general factor saturation h lemenkova turkish journal of maritime and marine sciences 4 2 146 155 153 this suggests that statistics is less related to the concept of caroline and philippine plates than mariana plate and its geomorphic environmental settings such as tg slope angle sediment thickness slope angle steepness figure 11 general factor saturation through omega coefficient 3 factors furthermore on the resulting table fig 5 one can see that each factor accounted for the 20 0 26 and 0 18 of the variance in responses leading to a factor solution that accounted for 100 of the total variance cumulative proportion pa 2 1 00 in the mariana trench morphology formation finally these factors are correlated in between at 0 15 and recall that this choice of the oblique rotation allowed for the recognition of this relationship the hypothesis testing was sufficient with following factors having the highest score tg slope angle sediment thickness mariana plate location 4 discussions current studies have revealed that there are factors influencing mariana trench geomorphic structure the most namely sediment thickness of the basement slope angle steepness degree angle aspect bathymetric factors such as depth at basement means median and minimal values closeness of the igneous volcanic areas causing possible earthquakes and geographic location across four tectonic continental plates including mariana pacific philippine and caroline the bathymetry of the ocean floor reflects plate tectonics processes including trench movement deformation and bending which is associated with mantle convection at the global scale therefore studying combination of these factors is a prerequisite for the correct understanding of the complex processes that take place in the abyssal environment of the mariana trench the tectonic plates sediment thickness and location of the igneous volcanic areas around the cross section profiles play an essential role in the morphology of the trench complex distribution of various environmental factors on the adjacent abyssal plains of the ocean contributes to the formation of the geomorphic features of the ocean bottom in the mariana trench 5 conclusions the main innovative idea of this research was integrated usage of r programming language and statistical analysis towards marine geological studies geological studies of such complex geomorphic oceanological system as mariana trench has specific points that distinguish it from the study of the valleys located on continents first the rocks of the ocean floor are a closed object which it is studied mainly by geophysical i e remote methods lemenkova turkish journal of maritime and marine sciences 4 2 146 155 154 these observations include the study of cores obtained from drilling vessels or platforms samples collected while dredging the seabed secondly the knowledge of the geology of the ocean is connected with a thorough understanding of the basics of geophysics geography geomorphology oceanography cartography informatics and principles of the data interpretation figure 12 euler venn logical diagram on correlation of impact factors affecting mariana trench upper four tectonic plates below environmental factors therefore a complex variety of methods is necessary to study mariana trench that has been demonstrated in this research by r programming language current research was intended to highlight the problem of the mariana trench very complex formation consisting of a variety of environmental factors mariana trench is formed as an ocean seafloor geomorphological structure located in the zones of the continental margin tectonic plates bending moreover a special attention was paid to the application of the algorithms of factor analysis scripts with screen shots of codes correlation matrix as well as visualization of factor analysis as a case study of this research the application of r programming towards geoscience studies successfully revealed impact factors affecting the abyssal morphology of the mariana trench it contributed towards question of how we can measure and analyze the structure of trench in the least reachable location of the world ocean acknowledgements the funding has been
