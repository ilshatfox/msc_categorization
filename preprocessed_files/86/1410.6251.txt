greve lowtem hokudai ac jp abstract the enthalpy method for the thermodynamics of polythermal glaciers and ice sheets is tested and verified by a one dimensional problem parallel sided slab the enthalpy method alone does not include explicitly the transition conditions at the cold temperate transition surface cts that separates the upper cold from the lower temperate layer however these conditions are important for correctly determining the position of the cts for the numerical solution of the polythermal slab problem we consider a two layer front tracking scheme as well as three different one layer schemes conventional one layer scheme one layer melting cts scheme one layer freezing cts scheme computed steady state temperature and water content profiles are verified with exact solutions and transient solutions computed by the one layer schemes are compared with those of the two layer scheme considered to be a reliable reference while the conventional one layer scheme that does not include the transition conditions at the cts can produce correct solutions for melting conditions at the cts it is more reliable to enforce the transition conditions explicitly for freezing conditions it is imperative to enforce them because the conventional one layer scheme cannot handle the associated discontinuities the suggested numerical schemes are suitable for implementation in three dimensional glacier and ice sheet models keywords glacier ice sheet polythermal ice modeling enthalpy method 1 introduction the decrease of the ice viscosity with increasing content of liquid water in temperate ice was first confirmed and measured by duval 1977 it is therefore desirable to simulate the water content in glaciers and ice sheets re alistically especially if the temperate ice occurs in a basal layer where shear deformation is largest mathematical models of polythermal ice masses were introduced and further developed by fowler and larson 1978 hutter 1982 fowler 1984 and hutter 1993 we distinguish essentially two types of polythermal glaciers canadian type poly thermal glaciers which are cold in most of the ice mass except for a temperate basal layer in the ablation zone and scandinavian type glaciers which are temperate in most parts except for a cold surface layer in the ablation zone fig 1 blatter and hutter 1991 this work attempts to verify thermodynamic schemes used in shallow ice sheet models therefore we do not investigate processes which are not usually included in ice sheet models such as possible diffusion of water in tem perate ice hutter 1993 and pre melting in ice at sub freezing temperatures dash et al 2006 for verification of numerical solutions with exact solutions we neglect the pressure dependence of the melting point and the temperature dependence of the heat conductivity and specific heat capacity following aschwanden and blatter 2005 ice is treated as temperate if a change in heat content leads to a change in liquid water content alone and is considered cold if a change in heat content leads to a temperature change alone this implies that temperate ice is at the melting point and the temperatures in cold ice are below the melting point polythermal schemes that solve the field equations for the cold and temperate layers separately were implemented for both types of polythermal glaciers in one dimension

cross sections of canadian and scandinavian type polythermal glaciers adapted from aschwanden et al 2012 three dimensional ice sheets which are canadian type polythermal greve 1997 with the assumption that water mostly accumulates along the trajectories of ice particles in the temperate layer aschwanden and blatter 2005 used a trajectory model to determine the position of the cold temperate transition surface cts and the water content in the temperate part of storglacia ren aschwanden et al 2012 suggested an enthalpy scheme with the idea that with enthalpy only one thermodynamic field variable must be computed and the temperature and water content result from the enthalpy as diagnostic fields the domains of cold and temperate ice are discriminated by the contour of the enthalpy of ice with no liquid water content at the melting point a crucial point in polythermal enthalpy schemes is their treatment of the stefan type energy and mass flux match ing conditions at the cts which are important for determining its position greve 1997 these transition conditions are not included explicitly in the formulation of the enthalpy scheme according to aschwanden et al 2012 two different cases must be distinguished melting conditions occur if cold ice flows across the cts into the temperate region at the cts the particles consist of ice at melting temperature without liquid water and after the transition start to accumulate water due to strain heating thus the boundary condition on the temperate side of the cts is zero water content to match the vanishing latent heat flux the diffusive heat flux and corresponding enthalpy gradient on the cold side must also vanish the situation is different for freezing conditions at the cts where the ice flows from the temperate region into the cold region and the liquid water content of the temperate ice freezes at the cts the advective latent heat flux on the temperate side then changes into a diffusive heat flux on the cold side thus a drop of a non vanishing water content to zero results in a non vanishing temperature enthalpy gradient in the cold layer at the cts this work attempts to verify and test modified enthalpy methods and in particular to test how the modified schemes handle the internal boundary between cold and temperate ice for the verification we use an exact solution which is available for steady states in a parallel sided slab which reduces the problem to one dimension greve 1997 greve and blatter 2009 in section 2 we review the main concepts of the enthalpy method and in section 3 we formulate the enthalpy method for the special case of the parallel sided slab section 4 deals with different one and two layer methods to solve this problem the two layer front tracking scheme being used to provide reference solutions against which the performance of the simpler one layer methods can be tested concrete numerical experiments are defined in section 5 and results are presented and discussed in sections 6 and 7 2 enthalpy formulation in this paper we follow the formulation of aschwanden et al 2012 and use the notation of greve and blatter 2009 all physical parameters namely the stress exponent n 3 and the rate factor a 5 3 10 24 s 1 pa 3 of glen s flow law the heat conductivity of ice 2 1 w m 1 k 1 the melting point of ice tm 0 c the density 2 of ice 910 kg m 3 the specific heat capacity of ice c 2009 j kg 1 k 1 and the latent heat of fusion l 3 35 105 j kg 1 are assumed to be constant for simplicity in particular this means that we neglect the slightly larger density of temperate ice compared to cold ice due to the 10 larger density of liquid water the liquid water content mass fraction of temperate ice is defined by w w 1 where w is the partial density of liquid water in the mixture let hm c tm be the enthalpy of ice at the melting temperature with vanishing water content for cold ice with a temperature t and temperate ice with a water content w the enthalpy is then given by h ct t tm hm lw t tm and 0 w 1 2 and the corresponding balance equation reads h t v grad h q tr t d 3 where t is time v the velocity vector q the heat flux vector t the cauchy stress tensor d the strain rate tensor the middle dot denotes tensor contraction and tr denotes the trace of a tensor the heat flux is given by the constitutive equation q c t c h 4 with the conductivity c t h hm 0 h hm 5 for cold ice h hm this is fourier s law of heat conduction while for temperate ice h hm the heat flux is omitted because of the vanishing temperature gradient tm 0 and the negligibly small at least for small water content w 1 water diffusion 3 polythermal slab to reduce the problem of a polythermal ice mass to a one dimensional problem we apply the plane strain approx imation for a two dimensional flow in the vertical x z plane of a parallel sided slab with constant and steady thickness h and constant inclination angle and without dependencies on the transverse y coordinates fig 2 furthermore we impose uniformity in the down slope x direction that is x 0 for any field quantity thermomechanical coupling is omitted thus strain heating due to horizontal shearing is prescribed e g greve 1997 greve and blatter 2009 tr t d 2 a g sin 4 h z 4 6 otherwise the downslope velocity profile vx z and basal sliding are not relevant for the problem in consideration owing to the assumed uniformity in x direction and the plane strain approximation the continuity equation mass balance takes the form vz z 0 for the slab problem so that the velocity component in z direction vz is constant over depth vz const due to the kinematic boundary conditions this means that the accumulation ablation rate at the slab surface is equal to the melting freezing rate at the base and both are equal to vz with all these conditions and neglect of water diffusion the balance equation for enthalpy eq 3 is reduced to h t vz h z 1 c z c t h z 2 a g sin 4 h z 4 7 we restrict this study to the canadian type polythermal slab the imposed enthalpy boundary condition at the surface of the cold layer is h z h hs t c ts t 8 3 atmosphere cold ice temperate ice lithosphere g z h z m z 0 h x z figure 2 polythermal parallel sided ice slab geometry and coordinate system adapted from greve and blatter 2009 depending on the direction of the ice flow through the cts melting and freezing conditions must be distinguished let a m wz vz 9 be the ice volume flux relative to the moving cts where wz dm dt is the kinematic migration velocity of the cts in z direction melting conditions are then characterised by a m 0 and freezing conditions by a m 0 we limit our considerations to the case that the kinematic velocity of the cts is smaller than the ice velocity in z direction wz vz so that melting and freezing conditions correspond to downward vz 0 and upward ice motion vz 0 respectively for melting conditions ice at the melting temperature with no liquid water flows from the cold into the temperate layer where water is produced along a trajectory of an ice particle by strain heating thus h h hm w 0 h z 0 10 where the cold layer is defined as the positive and the temperate layer as the negative side of the cts together with the imposed surface enthalpy hs the enthalpy hm at the cts and the vanishing enthalpy gradient constitute three boundary conditions for the cold layer which determine the evolution of the enthalpy profile and the thickness of the cold layer thus also the position of the cts since we have neglected water diffusion in the temperate layer the enthalpy hm at the cts alone determines the evolution of the enthalpy profile in the temperate layer no additional basal boundary condition is required however if a regularising small water diffusion were applied an additional basal boundary condition would be needed which then should be chosen carefully in order not to influence the numerical solution significantly for instance a zero flux condition for freezing conditions the enthalpy released by freezing of water flows into the cold ice along the enthalpy gradient h hm c h z h hm a m 11 with a m 0 h z can be strictly negative and h hm strictly positive equivalent to w 0 discontinuous water content at the cts the advection equation for enthalpy in the temperate layer requires one boundary condition for which we use the enthalpy at the ice base assuming a vanishing water content of the basal ice yields h z 0 hm 12 for the cold layer the dirichlet conditions 8 prescribed surface enthalpy and 11 1 determine the evolution of the enthalpy profile and condition 11 2 can be used to determine the evolution of the cts position by solving it for the kinematic velocity wz that is contained in the volume flux a m equation 7 with t 0 for the temperate layer is equivalent to the accumulation of water produced by strain heating along trajectories as stated above we only consider the case wz vz so that melting freezing conditions 4 correspond to downward upward ice motion therefore the water content tends to increase downwards from the cts for melting conditions and upwards from the bed for freezing conditions equations 7 12 to be complemented by an initial enthalpy profile hinit constitute the problem of the canadian type polythermal parallel sided slab under the additional assumption of steady state conditions t 0 for any field quantity they can be solved exactly with the exception of the position of the cts that must be obtained with a numerical root finding algorithm for details see greve 1997 or greve and blatter 2009 for the general transient case a numerical solution is required 4 numerical methods an established strategy to compute polythermal ice masses numerically is to split the computational domain into two distinct domains of cold and temperate ice and compute the respective temperature and water content on two different grids blatter and hutter 1991 greve 1997 pettersson et al 2007 however for the sake of simplicity it is desirable to produce a numerical solution of the problem with a one layer scheme i e on one grid that spans the entire polythermal domain here we describe possibilities for enthalpy based two layer and one layer schemes for both melting and freezing conditions at the cts for all schemes time is discretized by tn tinit n t n 0 nmax 13 where tinit is the initial time of the respective simulation n is the discrete time index and t the time step we have developed explicit euler forward and implicit euler backward versions of all schemes based on second order centred finite differences for the first and second derivatives with respect to z in the diffusion advection equation in the cold layer eq 7 with c and upstream first order differences for the first derivatives in the advection equation in the temperate layer eq 7 with t 0 4 1 two layer front tracking scheme the surface of the cold layer is at z h the bottom of the cold and top of the temperate layer thus the cts at z m t and the bottom of the temperate layer at z 0 fig 2 to solve the enthalpy equation 7 we map both layers separately to layers of thickness unity c z m t h m t t z m t t 14 where c and t are the transformed vertical coordinates in the cold and temperate layer respectively and is the transformed time the cts is therefore fixed with the lower and upper boundaries of the cold and temperate domains c 0 t 1 respectively the transformed equations 7 are for the cold layer h wz 1 c vz h m h c c 1 h m 2 2 h 2 c 2 a g sin 4 h m 4 1 c 4 15 and for the temperate layer h wz t vz m h t 2 a g sin 4 h m t 4 16 where wz dm dt is the kinematic velocity of the cts introduced in section 3 the spatial grids for the cold and temperate domain are defined by c kc kc kc max kc 0 kc max 17 5 and t kt kt kt max kt 0 kt max 18 where kc and kt are the discrete grid indices for the two domains and kc max and kt max denote the number of grid points in the domains for each time step from a given time tn to the new time tn 1 tn t eqs 15 and 16 are solved on these grids with the discretizations described above for melting conditions at the cts the enthalpy hs at the surface the enthalpy hm and the enthalpy gradient on the cold side of the cts are defined thus the position of the cts is determined by the enthalpy profile in the cold layer alone with the two boundary conditions for the cold layer given surface enthalpy hs and given enthalpy hm at the given cts z mn obtained for tn an integration step of eq 15 does not generally result in a vanishing enthalpy gradient at mn by approximating the enthalpy profile around mn by a quadratic parabola the position of the vertex of the parabola is a first approximation m 1 n 1 of the cts position at the new time tn 1 the position can then be iterated iteration index i to the desired accuracy m i 1 n 1 m i n 1 h z i n 1 2 h z 2 i n 1 19 using the first and second derivative of the enthalpy profile at m i n 1 furthermore from the displacement of the cts we obtain the kinematic velocity wz n 1 of the cts via wz n 1 mn 1 mn t 20 for freezing conditions the transition condition at the cts eq 11 2 in the transformed cold layer yields an equation for the ice volume flux a m through the cts a m h hm c h m h 21 the discretized version of this equation provides the volume flux a m n 1 and via eq 9 the kinematic velocity of the cts wz n 1 a m n 1 vz 22 which allows to update the cts position mn 1 mn wz n 1 t 23 4 2 conventional one layer scheme in contrast to the two layer scheme discussed in section 4 1 in the conventional one layer scheme which corre sponds to the enthalpy scheme by aschwanden et al 2012 eq 7 is solved for the entire polythermal slab on one grid in the z domain it is defined by zk k z h k kmax k 0 kmax 24 where k is the discrete grid index z the grid spacing resolution and kmax denotes the number of grid points this grid is also used for the modified one layer schemes described below sections 4 3 4 4 the cts must be tracked on this grid the cold and temperate layers can be discriminated by the contour h hm and we define the cts position k kcts as the uppermost grid point of the temperate part that is the uppermost grid point for which h hm holds transition conditions at the cts are not accounted for explicitly in our one dimensional implementation for a melting cts where the ice flows downwards the surface boundary condition given enthalpy and the assumed continuity of the enthalpy field at the cts define the entire enthalpy profile hk n 1 at the new time tn 1 when the profile hk n at the old time tn is known boundary conditions at the base are not necessary because of the advection equation 6 in the temperate layer therefore only one boundary condition at the surface of the cold layer is required to obtain a unique solution although the conductivity is constant in the cold and temperate layers c and t 0 respectively eq 5 the discretization of the diffusion term in eq 7 must take into account the variation of the conductivity at least across the cts i e for k kcts z c t h z c t h z k 1 2 n c t h z k 1 2 n z c hk 1 n hk n t hk n hk 1 n z 2 25 t kleiner personal communication february 2014 kleiner et al 2015 omission of this and discretizing the diffusion term in the form c t 2 h z 2 instead results in a faulty enthalpy profile that violates the melting cts transition condition 10 2 zero enthalpy gradient at the cold side of the cts for freezing conditions the method must fail because it is not consistent with the discontinuity of the enthalpy field at the cts that results from the discontinuity of the water content eq 11 and following text 4 3 one layer melting cts scheme we propose an alternative one layer scheme for melting conditions that enforces explicitly the zero enthalpy gradient at the cold side of the cts eq 10 2 for this scheme the discretization of the diffusion term in eq 7 need not consider a conductivity that depends on the position z like in eq 25 instead it can be done in the form c t 2 h z 2 c t k n hk 1 n 2 hk n hk 1 n z 2 with c t k n t k 0 kcts c k kcts 1 kmax 26 each time step is now divided into two iteration steps the predictor step for solving the enthalpy equation 7 is carried out for the entire polythermal slab as in the conventional one layer scheme section 4 2 this provides a preliminarily updated enthalpy profile h 1 k n 1 for this profile the updated position of the cts k kcts uppermost temperate grid point and the updated conductivities c t according to eq 5 for each grid point are determined the corrector step affects only the cold layer we repeat the forward step for the enthalpy equation from the grid point k kcts to the surface k kmax discretizing the zero enthalpy gradient on the cold side of the cts eq 10 2 by hkcts n 1 hkcts 1 n 1 27 this provides an enthalpy profile h 2 k n 1 for the cold layer only the complete updated enthalpy profile hk n 1 is assembled by the predictor step for the temperate layer and the corrector step for the cold layer hk n 1 h 1 k n 1 k 0 kcts h 2 k n 1 k kcts 1 kmax 28 4 4 one layer freezing cts scheme owing to the discontinuous enthalpy and enthalpy gradient at the cts eq 11 a one layer scheme for freezing conditions at the cts is more difficult to implement the advection equation in the temperate layer eq 7 with t 0 only requires one boundary condition which is the dirichlet condition 12 imposed value of the basal enthalpy corresponding to zero water content the advection equation can therefore be solved independently of the cold layer for each time step from tn to tn 1 we do so for the entire polythermal slab which provides a first profile h 1 k n 1 that is only valid for the temperate layer from the ice base to the yet unknown new position of the cts 7 we then solve the diffusion advection equation eq 7 with c in the cold layer based on the cts position mn at time tn in contrast to the one layer melting cts scheme the cts is tracked with sub grid precision as will be explained below we denote the uppermost grid point in the temperate layer as kcts and compute the enthalpy profile from the grid point k kcts to the surface k kmax a quadratic extrapolation using the three grid points above kcts is used as a boundary condition hkcts n 1 3 hkcts 1 n 1 3 hkcts 2 n 1 hkcts 3 n 1 29 this step provides a second enthalpy profile h 2 k n 1 that is valid for the cold layer from the cts to the surface tracking of the cts is carried out by using the transition condition 11 2 for this purpose the enthalpy on the temperate side of the cts is interpolated by h n 1 h 1 kcts mn zkcts n z h 1 kcts 1 n 1 h 1 kcts n 1 30 and the enthalpy gradient on the cold side of the cts is discretized by h z n 1 h 2 kcts 1 n 1 h 2 kcts n 1 z 31 inserting eqs 30 and 31 in eq 11 2 yields the updated volume flux a m n 1 according to eqs 22 and 23 this allows to update subsequently the kinematic velocity of the cts wz n 1 and the cts position mn 1 the latter actually constitutes a sub grid tracking of the cts that goes beyond the grid limited precision provided by kcts uppermost temperate grid point the final updated enthalpy profile hk n 1 is assembled from h 1 k n 1 and h 2 k n 1 according to eq 28 5 set up of the numerical experiments for all numerical experiments presented in this work the thickness of the polythermal slab is h 200 m and the inclination angle 4 fig 2 for melting conditions at the cts we set vz 0 2 m a 1 and for freezing conditions vz 0 2 m a 1 all experiments are designed such that the condition wz vz see eq 9 and the following text is fulfilled at all times steady states for enthalpy profiles or equivalently for temperature and water content profiles are computed for melting conditions with surface temperatures of 1 c and 3 c and for freezing conditions with 6 c and 10 c transient experiments are carried out for melting conditions with step changes of the surface temperature from 4 c to 2 c and vice versa and for freezing conditions with step changes from 10 c to 6 c and vice versa the step changes are employed at the initial time tinit 0 and the initial conditions for these four scenarios are steady states for the respective initial temperatures furthermore we perform experiments with sinusoidal variations of the surface temperature with a mean value of 2 c and an amplitude of 1 k for a melting cts and a mean value of 8 c and an amplitude of 2 k for a freezing cts the initial conditions for these scenarios are steady states for the mean surface temperatures 2 c and 8 c respectively and two different periods of 100 and 500 years are employed for both cases all discussed experiments with the two layer front tracking scheme are run with a resolution of 100 grid points in each layer and a time step of 0 01 years the standard resolution and time step for experiments with the three different one layer schemes are 1 m that is 200 grid points and 0 01 years respectively however we also use the combinations 2 m 100 grid points 0 01 years and 0 5 m 400 grid points 0 002 years this is indicated in the captions of the corresponding figures all of these combinations are stable for both the explicit and implicit versions of the several numerical schemes the implicit schemes allow for larger time steps of up to 100 years however then the accuracy of transient solutions is affected as long as small time steps within the range of stability of the explicit schemes are used differences of results between the explicit and implicit schemes are very small and virtually indistinguishable in normal plots therefore we only show results computed with the explicit schemes 8 6 results 6 1 two layer front tracking scheme the steady state results of the two layer front tracking tracking scheme can be verified with the exact analytical solutions greve 1997 greve and blatter 2009 figure 3 shows the computed steady state solutions enthalpy profiles converted back to temperature and water content profiles for both a melting and freezing cts and prescribed constant surface enthalpies hs c ts corresponding to the surface temperatures listed in section 5 these steady states agree to high accuracy with the exact solutions not shown explicitly the positions of the cts coincide within about 0 3 m which is better than the grid resolution in particular according to its design the scheme handles the discontinuities for freezing conditions at the cts well 10 5 0 5 0 50 100 150 200 h e ig h t a b o v e b a s e m 10 5 0 5 0

for the sinusoidal forcings are shown below in figs 5 8 and will be used as references to test the performance of the one layer schemes all runs were performed with both the explicit and the implicit version of the two layer front tracking tracking scheme the steady state solutions are almost independent of the time step within stability limits for the transient scenarios time steps longer than the standard time step section 5 act like a low pass filter again within stability limits they have little influence on the results as long as the time step is smaller than the rate of change of the conditions otherwise delayed responses and dampenings occur which for the sinusoidal forcings results in reduced amplitudes and phase shifts of the oscillating solutions 6 2 conventional one layer scheme figure 4 black line shows the steady state solution enthalpy profile converted back to temperature and water content profiles for a melting cts and a surface enthalpy corresponding to ts 3 c computed with the conven tional one layer scheme which corresponds to the enthalpy scheme by aschwanden et al 2012 the solution is almost identical to the exact solution and the one computed with the

conductivity at the cts is properly accounted for in the discretization of the diffusion term in the enthalpy equation eq 25 otherwise discontinuity of the conductivity at the cts disregarded discretization like in eq 26 a greatly flawed solution results grey line in fig 4 this solution has significantly larger enthalpies along the entire profile except for the surface the cts position is 4 times higher above the base than in the correct solution and it does not meet the required transition condition 10 2 at the cts 6 3 one layer melting cts scheme figure 5 shows a comparison of the one layer melting cts scheme with the two layer front tracking scheme that is considered to provide reference solutions it shows the position of the cts and the basal water content for the step change scenarios from ts 4 c to 2 c and vice versa section 5 for the one layer scheme the three different resolutions of 0 5 m 1 m standard and 2 m have been employed the transitions between the two states show some asymmetric behaviour depending on whether the cts moves in the direction of the cold or the temperate layer the evolution of the cts position is smooth for the two layer scheme whereas it occurs in steps for the one layer scheme this is a consequence of the cts tracking on the discrete grid in the one layer scheme section 4 3 which only allows an accuracy of one grid spacing the results obtained with the one layer scheme cts position basal water content show good convergence with increasing resolution to the reference solution obtained with the two layer scheme the computed cts positions for the two scenarios with sinusoidal forcings section 5 are shown in fig 6 again the results obtained with the two layer scheme are very smooth while the one layer scheme produces step changes of the cts position that reflect the resolution this becomes particularly evident for the short period 100 years for which the amplitude of the variability of the cts position is less then 2 m it can only be reproduced reasonably well by the highest resolution of 0 5 m while the 1 m resolution reproduces the variability only rudimentarily and the 2 m resolution yields only an average cts position for the long period 500 years the results are less susceptible to the grid resolution of comparable quality to those for the step change forcing shown in fig 5 a and the highest 0 5 m resolution matches closely the solution for the two layer front tracking method 6 4 one layer freezing cts scheme we now compare the performance of the one layer freezing cts scheme with that of the two layer front tracking scheme figure 7 shows the evolution of the height of the cts above the bed and the water content at the temperate side of the cts for the step change scenarios from ts 10 c to

of 500 years the three different solid lines correspond to grid resolutions of 0 5 m black 1 m medium grey and 2 m light grey 14 since the upward moving ice reduces the response of the system to surface perturbations at a given depth the freezing cts requires a longer time for adjustment than the melting cts compare with fig 5 a a further notable difference is that the cts evolution is smooth for both the one layer and two layer schemes this is a consequence of the sub grid tracking of the cts employed in the one layer freezing cts scheme section 4 4 whereas the one layer melting cts scheme allows tracking the cts only with grid limited precision section 4 3 by contrast the computed water content at the cts shows some step changes for the one layer scheme while it is also smooth for the two layer scheme for all three resolutions of the one layer scheme the results agree well with those of the two layer scheme the largest but still acceptable discrepancy is found for the water content at the cts computed with the 2 m resolution figure 8 shows the evolutions of the cts positions for the two scenarios with sinusoidal forcings section 5 computed with the one layer freezing cts scheme and the two layer scheme the amplitude of the variations of the cts position is substantially smaller than that of the melting cts even though the amplitude of the surface perturbation is larger 2 k vs 1 k which is again due to the upward direction of the ice motion that delays and dampens changes of the surface conditions at depth for both periods 100 and 500 years and all resolutions the agreement to the reference results two layer scheme is within about the grid resolution of the one layer scheme as already observed in fig 7 a the sub grid tracking leads to a smooth evolution of the cts and the simulated amplitudes agree very well for all schemes and resolutions 7 discussion and conclusion the conventional one layer scheme which corresponds to the implementation of the enthalpy method by as chwanden et al 2012 does not explicitly take into account the stefan type energy and mass flux matching condi tions at the cts that are crucial for determining the position of the cts nevertheless we have demonstrated that this scheme can determine the cts position for the case of melting conditions correctly however this depends criti cally on the proper numerical handling of the discontinuity of the conductivity across the cts and is therefore prone to failure if the implementation is not done with great care for the case of freezing conditions with the associated discontinuity of the enthalpy at the cts the conventional one layer scheme fails inevitably two layer front tracking schemes using a time dependent terrain following coordinate transformation for the cold and temperate layers separately blatter and hutter 1991 greve 1997 pettersson et al 2007 can also be used in conjunction with the enthalpy method we have constructed such a scheme and have shown that it produces very good results for both melting and freezing conditions however schemes using only one grid for the entire polythermal slab are simpler to implement in existing ice sheet models and therefore more desirable therefore we have proposed one layer methods that modify the original enthalpy scheme by aschwanden et al 2012 in order to treat explicitly the transition conditions at the cts for both cases of a melting and freezing cts the proposed methods work well in our one dimensional model provided that the time steps and grid resolutions are sufficiently small we expect them to work as well in shallow ice sheet models where the thermodynamics neglects horizontal diffusive heat fluxes and thus treats vertical enthalpy or temperature profiles essentially in a one dimensional way horizontal advective heat fluxes can be treated as additional source terms of the vertical profiles in fact we have already implemented the one layer melting cts scheme in the ice sheet model sicopolis e g sato and greve 2012 greve and herzfeld 2013 url http www sicopolis net which despite the required adjustments for the additional physics pressure dependence of the melting point as well as temperature dependent heat conduc tivity and specific heat capacity accounted for could be done in a fairly straightforward way paper in preparation with some additional effort due to the complicating horizontal diffusive heat fluxes implementations in non shallow higher order or full stokes ice sheet and glacier models should also be feasible acknowledgements we thank f saito a
