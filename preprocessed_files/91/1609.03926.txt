of science and technology harbin 150080 china 2 corresponding author schlumberger westerngeco 3519 heartland key ln katy tx 77494 abstract in this paper we study a single species population model with pulse toxicant input to a small polluted environment the intrinsic rate of population is affected by environment and toxin in organisms the toxin in organisms is influenced by toxin in environment and the food chain a new mathematical model is derived by the pulse compare theorem we find the surviving threshold of the population and obtain the sufficient conditions of persistence and extinction of the population keywords pollution extinction persistence impulsive toxicant input 1 introduction in the real world with the rapid development of modern industry and agriculture environmental pollution has become an increasingly serious problem untreated pollutants are release to the environment continuously this causes many serious environmental problems and damages the ecological system this is a global issue populations of a lot of animal species have become extinct or endangered therefore it is very important to study surviving conditions of the population in polluted environment in the 1980 s hallam et al 1983 1984 studied the toxicant effectsin the environment on a single species population in their paper they assumed that relative to population size the capacity of the environment is large so the population absorption and excretion of toxins can be omitted many good results were obtained about the extinction and persistence of the population 1 3 but in a relatively closed environment the effect of population s own emission toxin can t be omitted he jinwei usually we write he et al 2007 2009 studied the survival problem of the population assuming that the intrinsic rate of population is to be affected by the environment and the toxins of the body 4 7 in most cases it is assumed that it is a continuous process for the toxins entering into the environment but in the real world it is not always true and the majority of cases are often represented as a periodic emission such as industrial waste water or waste water discharge agricultural pesticide spraying etc in these cases the discharge time of toxins compared with the population s life cycle is very short but their effect on the organism is of longer term liu bing may liu et al 2003 2 studied the survival effects of population on the pulse cycle toxin emissions under a fixed input quantitative toxin 8 at a fixed time zhang hong et al 2008 established a single population model in a polluted environment by assuming that other external toxins discharged into the environment at a fixed time period they showed that the population is extinct when the pulse period is less than a certain threshold conversely the population is permanent they also demonstrated that sustained living conditions can ensure existence and uniqueness of positive periodic solutions which are globally and asymptotically stable 9 10 jiao jianjun et al 2009 investigated a single population model with impulsive toxicant input in a polluted environment under the assumption that the toxins of population are also affected by the toxins in the food chain discussed the extinction and permanent existence of the population and drawed a conclusion that the population can be protected by changing the input toxin quantity and period 11 13 on the basis of the work in 11 we establish a model by assuming that the capacity of the environment is not large enough and the intrinsic rate of population is affected by the environment and the toxins level in the body we also assume that the toxicant stored by the dead organisms is considered as one type of toxins then we have the following model 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 o e o

denotes the concentration of the toxicant in an organism at time t and ec t represents the concentration of the toxicant in the environment at time t is intra specific competition of the population 0

1 d g m k h are positive constants in this paper we study the dynamic behavior of model 1 in section 2 we prove that the model 1 has the non negative solutions and they are ultimately bounded by inequality scaling method thus the survival upper bound of the population is found in section 3 by the pulse compare theorem we get the solution of model 1 which has a non negative lower bound and derive the sufficient condition of persistent survival of the population in section 4 we obtain the sufficient condition for extinction of the population some summaries are given in the last section 2 positive and boundedness of solutions in order to prove the persistence of solutions for model 1 we need to show that they are non negative and have upper and lower bounds first we prove that there does exist a positive solution we set initial values of model 1 as followings 0 0 x 0 0 1 oc 0 0 1 ec 3 in model 1 we assume 0 t r n n where n is a non negative integer set first we have the following conclusion with respect to the positive property of solutions of model 1 theorem 1 the solution o ex t c t c t of model 1 with initial conditions 3 is non negative proof integrating the first function of model 1 from 0 to t gives 0 0 0 exp t o e x t x r c c x d so if 0 0 x we have 0 x t for 0 t next we prove 0 oc t 0 ec t since 0 0 ec 0 ec t it is obvious 0 0 ec but for 0 oc we have two cases as follows case i 0 0 oc as 0 oc t from the second and third functions of model 1 we have 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 o e e o e t dc t kc fc g m b x c k f c dt 4 1 0 0 0 0 0 e e e t dc t k c x hc dt hence there must exist a positive number such that 0 oc t 0 ec t for 0 t then when 0 t we have 0 oc t 0 ec t 4 if it is not there must exist a positive number t such that 0 o ec t c t for 1 t n t nt and 0 oc t 0 ec t for 0 t t therefore there are only three cases at the end point t for the first case 0 oc t 0 e c t if 0 oc t is true then it is obvious 0 o dc t dt for 0 t t but from the second function of model 1 we have 0 o e t t dc t k f c t dt there is a contradiction so the first situation doesn t hold for the second case 0 oc t 0 e c t if 0 ec t is true then it is obvious 0 e dc t dt for 0 t t but from the third function of model 1 we have 1 1 1 0 e o o t t dc t g d c t c t x t dt there is a contradiction thus the second situation is not true for the third case 0 oc t 0 e c t it is obvious that 0 0 x t is the solution of model 1 at the same time it is also the solution of model 1 with initial values satisfying 0 x t 0 oc t 0 ec t the uniqueness theorems of solution yields 0 oc t 0 ec t for 0 t this is also a contradiction hence the third situation doesn t hold we conclude that 0 0 oc case ii 0 0 oc from 0 0 oc and the continuity of oc t for any 1 0 we have 0 oc t for 10 t furthermore 0 0 ec whatever 0 e t dc t dt is positive or negative we can promise that for any 2 0 we have 0 ec t for 20 t so let 1 2 min 0 there is 0 oc t 0 ec t for 0 t next we prove when 0 t there is 5 0 oc t 0 ec t then the proof of case ii is similar to that of case i the result still holds next we prove that all positive solutions of model 1 have upper bounds theorem 2 for model 1 if 0 1 h m gfr g for any t r there must exist a positive number m such that limsup t x t m limsup o t c t m limsup e t c t m proof from theorem 1 and the first equation of model 1 we have 0 dx t x t r x t dt standard comparison theorem produces 0 1 limsup t r x t m 5 defining 1 o e g v t c t x t c t g and using 2 one can obtain 1 e e g d v t mv t fc t x t h m c t g expression 5 and 0 1 h m gfr g when t nt gives 0 1 0 e fr g d v t mv t h m c t g when t nt there is 1 g v nt v nt g so for 1 t nt n t pulse inequality lemma 2 2 in 14 gives 1 1 0 1 1 m t t mt mt mt mt g e g e v t v e g e g e hence v t is uniformly bounded which is 2 1 limsup 1 mt mt t g e v t m g e according to the definition of v t and theorem 1 one can derive 2 limsup o t c t x t m 1 2 limsup e t g c t m g 6 the second function or equation of model 1 and 6 leads to 1 2 2 3 0 limsup e t k f g m m g c t m g g m b let 1 1 2 3 max g m m m m g so there is limsup t x t m limsup o t c t m limsup e t c t m 6 from theorem 1 and theorem 2 there is a invariant set in mode 1 that is 0 0 0 o e o ex t c t c t x t m c t m c t m 3 persistence survival of population in theorem 2 we know that the solutions of model 1 have upper bounds in this section in order to investigate the survival of the population we will prove that model 1 has a non negative lower bound now we can analyze the model 1 by the impulsive differential equations comparison theorem to find the lower bound as follows theorem 3 for model 1 if 0 0 k f r t h g m b h 7 then the population x t will be uniformly persistent proof from theorem 2 we know that x t is ultimately bounded hence in order to prove that the population x t is uniformly persistent we can only need to show that x t has the lower bound if not for any 0 when 0 t there is x t 8 considering the last two equations of model 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 o e o o e e e o e o o e dc t k f c t g m b c t x t c t dt t nt dc t hc t k c t g d c t c t c t x t dt c t c t t nt 9 we set up o ec t c t is the solution of model 9 from theorem 2 and 8 we get the pulse comparison equation corresponding equation of model 9 0 0 du t k f v t g m b u t m dt t nt dv t hv t a dt u v t nt 10 where 1 1 1 1 a g d m m m let u t v t be the solution of model 10 with initial values 0 0 ou c 0 0 ev c we will finish the proof by the following three steps 7 first we prove that model 10 only has a positive periodic solution u t v t which is globally attractive in the interval 1 nt n t the solution of the second function of model 10 is h t nt a a v t v nt e h h 11 from v t and 11 we have 1 ht a a v n t v nt e h h 12 which implies a stroboscopic map 1 v n t h v nt 13 where ht a a h y y e h h we get the only fixed point of map 13 that is 1 ht a v e h 14 it is easily to show that 1 hth v e so sequence 1 v n t converges to v using 11 and 14 we have h t nta a v t v e h h 1 nt t n t similarly from the first function of model 10 we can get 0 g m b t nth t ntq v a h q v a h u t p e u p e where 0 k f a h m p g m b 0 k f q g m b h 0 0 1 g m b tht g m b t q v a h e e u p e therefore the model 10 only has a positive periodic solution u t v t now we prove that the positive periodic solution u t v t is also globally asymptotically stable if u t v t is the any solution of model 10 define the transformation m t u t u t n t v t v t 15 then expression 10 is changed as follows 0 dm t k f n t g m b m t dt dn t hn t dt 16 let 0 0 m u 0 0 n v be initial values of model 16 8 from the second function of model 16 we have 0 htn t v e 17 first function of model 16 also gives 0 0 0 0 0 0 g m b tht k f v k f v m t e u e h g m b h g m b 18 using 17 and 18 we get lim 0 t n t lim 0 t m t so u t v t is globally attractive second we prove the population x t is uniformly persistent using the comparison theorem 15 and the globally asymptotically stable property of u t v t there exists a positive number 0 0 t for arbitrarily small 0 and when 0 t t we have o e c t u t u t c t v t v t 19 using 19 and the first function of model 1 we have 0 0 o e dx t x t r c t c t x t dt x t r u t v t 20 define 1 n n and 1 0 n t t integrating 20 from nt to 1 n t 1 n n leads to 0 1 0 0 0 1 exp exp 1 1 1 1 1 n t nt ht ht g m b t ht x n t x nt r u t v t dt q x nt r t pt e h e q at v a u p e g m b e h 0 0 1 exp hth e h q q at x nt r t pt h g m b h h exp 0 exp x nt x n 21 where 0 0 0 0 q q at r t pt h g m b h h a q q r p t h h g m b h 0 0 2 0 k f a h m a r t g m b h k f h g m b h 22 9 from 7 we know 0 0 k f r t h g m b h hence for given 0 m we choose sufficiently small 0 and 0 such that 0 0 0 k f a h m k fa r t g m b h h g m b h from 22 we get 0 so 21 yields lim n x nt this is a contradiction with 8 hence there exists a positive number 1 0 t t such that 1 x t third we prove when 1 t t we have expx t t 23 where 0 1 sup nt t n t r u t v t if not there exist 2 1 t t such that 2 expx t t according to the continuity of x t with t there exists 1 2 t t t such that x t and x t for 2 t t t for any 2 t t t we choose a non negative integer l such that 2 1 t t lt t l t integrating 20 from t to 2 t we get 2 2 2 0 0 0 exp exp exp exp t t t lt t t t lt t lt t x t x t r u t v t dt r u t v t dt r u t v t dt 2 exp t t there is a contradiction so 23 is right in summary we have liminf exp t x t t sufficient conditions of persistence of the population are obtained from theorem 3 conversely if the condition of theorem 3 is false the population may be extinct in next section we study the conditions of the extinction of the population 4 extinction of population theorem 4 for model 1 if 0 0 k f r t h g m b h 24 then we have the population x t becomes extinct proof for proving the extinction of population x t we only prove lim 0 t x t using theorem 2 and the last two functions of model 1 we have 10 0 1 0 0 o e e o e e e dc t kc t fc t g m b

the solution of model 26 with the initial values 0 0 os c 0 0 ew c following the same procedure as the solving process of model 10 model 26 has a positive periodic solution as follows 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 1 g m b t nt k m h t nt g m b t nt k m h t k m h t nt k f e e s t s e k m h g m b e w t w e where 0 2 02 2 2 0 1 1 1 g m b t k m h t g m b tk m h t k m h t k f e e s k m h g m b e e w e and the positive periodic solution s t w t of 26 is globally asymptotically stable using the comparison theorem 15 and the globally asymptotically stable property of s t w t there exists a positive number 0 0 t for arbitrarily small 0 0 and when 0 t t we have 0 o c t s t s t 0 e c t w t w t 27 for proving the extinction of the population x t of model 1 the contradiction method is used assuming that for arbitrarily small 0 when 0 t t there is x t 28 using 27 28 and the first function of model 1 we get when 0 t t 0 0 0 dx t x t r s t w t dt 29 setting 2 n n and 2 0 n t t and integrating 29 from nt to 1 n t 2 n n yields to 11 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 1 1 1 exp exp exp 0 exp n t nt x n t x nt r s t w t dt k f x nt r t g m b k m h k m h x nt x n 30 where 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 k f r t g m b k m h k m h 31 from 24 we know 0 0 k f r t h g m b h for given 0 m we choose sufficiently small 0 0 and 0 such that 0 0 0 1 0 1 k f r t k m h g m b k m h from 31 we get 1 0 when 1 0 30 gives 1 0 x n t from theorem 1 we also get 1 0 x n t which means 1 0 x n t it demonstrates that the population x t is eventually extinct when 1 0 30 shows 11 0 exp 0 x n t x n n which is contradiction with 28 so there exists 1 0 t t such that 1 x t now we prove that when 1 t t we have 1 expx t t 32 where 1 0 0 0 1 sup nt t n t r s t w t if not there exists 2 1 t t such that 2 1 expx t t hence there exists 1 2 t t t such that x t and x

regularly input towards the environment is directly related to the survival of the population x t theorem 3 and theorem 4 give the sufficient conditions for survival and extinction of population x t

paper we study a single population model with pulse input of environmental toxin in a relatively small polluted environment we obtain the conditions and a threshold of extinction and persistence of the population the threshold is 0 0 hbmgh fk trr that is when 1 r the population is persistent when 1 r the population is extinct the degree of pollution of the environment is directly related to survival and extinction of the population from the definition of threshold it is learned that if the toxicant input amount is constant we must extend the period of the exogenous input of toxicant in order to ensure the survival of the population if the period of the exogenous input of toxicant discharge is fixed we must decrease the toxicant input amount in view of ensuring the survival of population at the same time the results of numerical simulation demonstrate the influence of the period and amount of the exogenous input of toxicant on survival and extinction of populations due to the limitations of the population to survive the pollution problem in a small environment in this paper is more consistent with real problem than that in a big environment comparing the results of two types of environment we can note that when the toxicant input amount is the same the threshold of extinction and persistence of the population in a small environment is larger and the survival condition of population cecomes weaker so in order to make the population to survive in a small environment we only need to reduce the amount of discharge toxins and extend the time of emission in real world when facing pollutants from the environment young population and adult population have different reactions considering the population with the different age structure has more practical significance so this issue can be studied as a follow up research on the basis of the current research work acknowledgments 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 0 0 5 1 1 5 t x t 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80
