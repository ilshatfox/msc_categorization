nebraska lincoln corresponding author waynelee 1217 gmail com nishant malik department of mathematics dartmouth college and peter j mucha department of mathematics university of north carolina at chapel hill received on 4 november 2021 we study a model for switching strategies in the prisoner s dilemma game on adaptive networks of player pairings that coevolve as players attempt to maximize their return we use a node based strategy model wherein each player follows one strategy at a time cooperate or defect across all of its neighbors changing that strategy and possibly changing partners in response to local changes in the network of player pairing and in the strategies used by connected partners we compare and contrast numerical simulations with existing pair approximation differential equations for describing this system as well as more accurate equations developed here using the framework of approximate master equations we explore the parameter space of the model demonstrating the relatively high accuracy of the approximate master equations for describing the system observations made from simulations we study two variations of this partner switching model to investigate the system evolution predict stationary states and compare the total utilities and other qualitative differences between these two model variants keywords evolutionary games prisoner s dilemma adaptive networks network dynamics approximate master equations 1 introduction game theory is the study of strategic decision making and the analysis of mathematical models of con flict and cooperation between intelligent rational participants 13 17 36 game theory is used in a variety of disciplines including biology economics political science computer science and psychol ogy in classical game theory rational actors make their choices to optimize their individual payoffs that is actors make strategic choices on a rationally determined evaluation of probable outcomes or utility considering the strategic analysis that the players opponents are making in determining their own choices evolutionary game theory 21 24 39 57 68 the application of game theory to evolv ing populations has recently expanded from consideration of lifeforms in biology to various areas in social science evolutionary game theory is useful in this context by defining a framework of contests strategies behaviors and analytics in which competition can be modeled the key point in evolutionary game theory is that the success of a strategy is not just determined by how good the strategy is in itself rather it is a question of how good the strategy is in the presence of other alternative strategies and of the distribution of those other strategies within a population c the author 2021

difficulties of darwinian theory recognized by darwin himself was the problem of altruism 35 in particular exploited cooperators are worse off than defectors hence according to the basic principles of darwinian selection intuitively it seems almost certain that cooperation should go extinct if the basis for selection is at the individual level the phenomenon of altruism is often hard to interpret and selection at the group level or for the greater good appears to violate the game theory assumption of individuals maximizing their own utility indeed altruism is certainly not found to be the general case in nature nevertheless altruistic behaviors can be found in many social animals and indeed can be fundamental for some species to survive 7 the solution to this apparent paradox can be demonstrated in the application of evolutionary game theory to the prisoner s dilemma game 2 34 a game which tests the outcomes of cooperating versus defecting cooperation is usually analyzed in game theory by means of a non zero sum game the prisoner s dilemma game one of the most studied systems in all of game theory is a standard example that shows why two completely rational individuals may not cooperate even if it appears that it is in their best collective interest to do so within evolutionary game theory the analysis of the prisoner s dilemma is as an iterative game 33 with the repetitive nature affording competitors the possibility of retaliating or defecting based on the results of previous rounds of the game there are a multitude of strategies which have been tested by the mathematics of evolutionary game theory and in computer simulations of contests see e g 8 with the general conclusion that the most effective competitive strategies are typically cooperative with a reserved retaliatory response as necessary the most famous and one of the most successful of these strategies is tit for tat which carries out this approach by executing a simple algorithm 2 37 in recent years games played on various random graphs and social networks have been investi gated 1 6 10 11 20 23 26 29 31 38 50 54 for example the public goods game can be seen as a generalization of multiplayer n player games and group interactions such as pattern formation and self organization could be studied through this extension 18 46 62 the studies devoted to evolution ary games on complex networks are extensive speaking generally the goals of such studies typically include identifying which combination of game rules dynamics and various network topologies can provide cooperation among selfish and unrelated individuals in the present work we focus on the dynamical role of players having the option to switch partners as studied in the framework of adaptive networks that coevolve with the player strategies 42 43 48 59 61 on a coevolving or adap tive network with a game the vertices represent players and the edges denote the pairings or game interactions between players importantly the spatial structures in a network could enable cooperators to form small groups or clusters to protect themselves against exploitation by defectors 38 studies have shown that the spatial structure can promote cooperation 27 but there is also evidence that suggests that spatial structure may not necessarily favor cooperation 20 other studies have elaborated on different aspects of coop eration on scale free 15 45 51 square lattice 49 53 small world 30 55 63 social and real world networks 9 25 32 and multilayer networks 67 insofar as the player pairing network is part of a larger social setting other notable rules encouraging cooperative behavior are kin selection 16 group selection 5 65 direct reciprocity 44 indirect reciprocity 40 41 social diversity 47 56 69 vol untary participation 4 19 22 reputation 10 and frequency of breaking cooperator defector bonds and rewiring 60 61 all of these have been studied as interesting mechanisms that may promote cooperation in evolutionary games in this paper we focus our study on a simple coevolving network model for how players play a prisoner s dilemma game with the ability to adapt by changing their strategies or switching partners if they are exploited by their neighbors introduced in 11 we are interested in exploring the cooperative 3 of 24 level among the individuals as they organize into networks of cooperators by using the technique of approximate master equations we provide a more accurate approximation of the evolution of the net work structure and player states with which to explore the parameter space of the model we compare the existing analytical methods and our new approximation providing qualitative and quantitative esti mations of various network properties in section 2 we introduce the model we then describe our more accurate approximation in section 3 in section 4 we provide numerical results and compare the two approximation methods in section 5 we introduce a variation to the model and compare the results of the two variants of the model finally we make concluding remarks in section 6 2 description of the cd switching model we study the partner switching model introduced by fu et al 11 where vertices of the coevolving net work represent players edges denote the pairing of individuals playing the game and players adapting by changing strategies based on their current local information or switching partners for simplicity we initialize our simulations with an erdo s re nyi network with n nodes and m edges with each node assigned an initial state either as a cooperator c or defector d each node uses a single strategy across all of its links though that strategy can change over time as we describe below that is individ ual i playing with all of her connections obtains an income pi j ni sti ps j where ni is the neighborhood set of i and the 2 by 2 payoff matrix p is c d c 1 0 d 1 u u with cost benefit ratio u 0 1 determining the relative outcomes in the payoff matrix that is if players i and j in a pairing both play c then both receive the payoff 1 from this pairing if player i plays c and player j plays d then player i gets payoff 0 and player j gets payoff 1 u and so on each time step of our microsimulation proceeds as follows we uniformly at random pick one of the edges that connects a pair of players with different strategies i e a cd link denoted by ei j in section 5 we study a variant of the model where both cd and dd links are considered with probability w specified as a parameter the two nodes i and j connected by edge ei j consider updating their strategies otherwise i e with probability 1 w the edge ei j is rewired when a node reassesses its strategy along the edge ei j the node has probability specified by the fermi function to change its state as first proposed by 58 as specified in detail below when link ei j is rewired the player with end state c unilaterally drops the partnership with its neighbor with end state d on the edge ei j and picks uniformly at random another player from the remaining population outside its immediate neighborhood as its new partner the left panel of fig 1 illustrates this rewiring process when a strategy updating event occurs nodes i and j each consider their play across all of their neighbors observing their total payoffs pi and pj then the strategy of node j replaces that of i along the edge ei j that is i copies j s strategy with probability given by the fermi function si s j 1 1 exp pi pj 4 of 24 x z r r br y x y 1 1 1 5 0 5 0 5 4 u 0 5 fig 1 illustrations of the rewiring and strategy updating processes pick a discordant edge xy with node x in state c and node y in state d left rewiring occurs with probability 1 w with cooperating node x dismissing its defecting neighbor y and rewiring to a random node z in the network independent of the state of node z if z is in state d then the number of cd edges remains the same but if z is cooperating as in the picture then the number of cd edges has been reduced right strategy updating occurs with probability w nodes x and y compare their utilities with one node copying the other as selected according to the fermi function of the difference of utilities in the example depicted here suppose the cost benefit ratio u 0 5 and the fermi function bias parameter 30 then node x has utility px 1 node y has utility py 4 and the fermi function gives sx sy 1 1 exp px py 1 1 exp 30 1 4 1 so that node x is selected with probability close to 1 to imitate node y s strategy state d where modifies the intensity of the bias towards the strategy with the higher payoff 12 64 otherwise that is with probability s j si 1 si s j j copies i the value of 1 can be interpreted here as representing the amplitude of noise in the strategy updating process 52 66 that is 0 ignores the payoffs while yields deterministic imitation of the node receiving the higher payoff the right panel of fig 1 illustrates the strategy updating process this partner switching evolutionary game stops when there are no discordant edges remaining in the network that is only cc and dd edges exist in the final state of the system with the final network fissioning these two groups cooperative and defective into different components in fig 2 we visualize a simulated network shortly before fission occurs showing strong grouping of nodes by strategies we note that recent work 28 studied a spatially embedded extension of the partner switching model in 11 introducing a range of rewiring distance and finding that a preference for global partner switch ing can coevolve with cooperation however in the present contribution we consider only random rewiring partner switching 3 semi analytical methods of approximation we study this generalized coevolving network model with simulations and approximate model equa tions the frameworks of mean field theory mf pair approximation equations pa and approxi mate master equations ame have all been used effectively in similar settings the pa equations for these dynamics were obtained by 11 among these three levels of approximation ame can often be used to achieve the greatest accuracy 14 motivating us to develop the ame system here for comparison with the ame system that we will specify we first look at the pa equations derived in 11 describing the dynamics of the quantities nx and nxy where x y c d that count the numbers of nodes and edges corresponding to the two node states for example nc denotes the number 5 of 24 fig 2 visualization of the cd switching coevolving network model shortly before the network fissions into two disconnected components one including all of the remaining cooperator nodes blue and the other containing only defecting nodes red this simulation contains n 1 000 nodes and m 5 000 edges with cost benefit ratio u 0 5 strategy updating probability w 0 1 and initial fraction of defectors 0 5 this visualization was created using the yifan hu layout in gephi 3 of cooperators and ncc denotes the number of cc links in the network while the node states and network topology coevolve the total numbers of nodes n and edges m remain conserved by the specified dynamics requiring nc nd n and ncc ncd ndd m the evolution of these counts is then obtained through a moment closure approximating triple counts nxy z where x y z c d in terms of the edge counts ncc ncd and ndd specifically nxxy is approximated by the product of xx links and the average number of xy links that an x node has i e nxy nx hence nxxy 2 nxx nxy nx the resulting pa equations 11 are as follows dnc dt w ncd tanh 2 c d dncc dt w ncd c d 2 ncd ncc nc d c ncd ncd nd c d 1 w nc n ncd dndd dt w ncd d c 2 ncd ndd nd c d ncd ncd nc d c 3 1 where w is the probability of strategy updating versus edge rewiring c 1 2 ncc nc 0 ncd nd is the average utility of c nodes d 1 u ncd nd u 2 ndd nd is the average utility of d nodes c d 1 1 exp d c d c 1 1 exp c d and controls the intensity of selection the ame method has been successfully used to approximate various processes on static and coe volving networks the difficulty in deriving the ame system for the dynamics studied here is that the present transition probabilities depend on more than nearest neighbor states for comparison in the sis 6 of 24 model the recovery rate of an infected i node and the probability of infection along a given si edge are both specified as constant parameters similarly in typical voter model dynamics the probability for a node to change its state relies on its neighbors opinions in contrast in the partner switching evolutionary game studied here the local information impacting the decision of a node to change its state includes its total utility and that of its neighbors which depend on the states of the neighbors neighbors since the binary state ame framework only includes the node states degrees and neighbor states we need estimate neighbors utilities in terms of these limited quantities we will explain how we approximate these utilities after we introduce the equations below let ck l t and dk l t respectively be the number of cooperating and defecting nodes of degree k with l defecting neighbors at time t we note that the numbers of nodes using each strategy are then given by the zeroth moments of the ck l t and dk l t distributions nc kl ck l and nd kl dk l meanwhile the first moments give the numbers of edges of each type ncc 1 2 kl k l ck l ncd kl lck l kl k l dk l and ndd 12 kl ldk l importantly while the node states and network topology coevolve the total numbers of nodes and edges remain conserved by the specified dynamics requiring nc nd n and ncc ncd ndd m the ame system of ordinary differential equations governing the ck l t and dk l t compartments is of course more complicated than the relatively compact pa equations 3 1 in the following para graphs we describe each of the terms that appear in this ame system dck l dt w d k l k l dk l c k l lck l cd cc c l 1 ck l 1 cd cc clck l cc cd c k l 1 ck l 1 cc cd c k l ck l 1 w nc n l 1 ck l 1 lck l ncd n ck 1 l ck l 3 2 ddk l dt w dk l k l dk l c k l lck l dd dc d l 1 dk l 1 dd dc dldk l dc dd d k l 1 dk l 1 dc dd d k l dk l 1 w k l 1 dk 1 l k l dk l ncd n dk 1 l dk l 3 3 to describe the ame derivation we focus on explaining the ck l equation as the effects of correspond ing terms of the dk l equation are similar the first three lines of equation 3 2 pre multiplied by w are the effect of strategy updating while the last line with 1 w are the effect of rewiring to write the ame system we track all counts flowing in and out of center class ck l as visualized in fig 3 there are six such flows for the ck l compartment yielding the first six terms in the ck l equation the first term describes the rate at which dk l nodes change to ck l through comparing its utility with one of its c neighbors with the fermi function evaluation dk l as estimated below similarly the second term cap tures ck l nodes changing strategy to become dk l after comparing their utility with their d neighbors with fermi function evaluation ck l also estimated below 7 of 24 fig 3 illustration of transitions to and from the ck l and dk l compartments cooperating and defecting nodes respectively with degree k and l defecting neighbors in the system of approximate master equations due to players updating their strategies for each compartment only a subset of neighbors in the corresponding ego network are depicted here to signal the essential changes corresponding to each flow the term describing each flow is indicated above below the corresponding red line connecting compartments to estimate these fermi function transition probabilities we can directly compute the utility of the center node since we know the numbers and types of its neighbors but we need to estimate neighbors utilities in terms of the limited information available in the ame framework recall that the payoff matrix of our prisoner s dilemma game is c d c 1 0 d 1 u u where u 0 1 for transitions by a strategy update out of the dk l class the center node is of state d with k neighbors l of which are of state d hence we can compute the center s utility as pd l u k l 1 u since we do not have any information about the neighbors of the c neighbors of these dk l nodes we approximate utility by estimating the numbers and types of the neighbors of a c neighbor specifically we denote the expected number of c neighbors of this c neighbor by d and the expected number of d neighbors of a c neighbor by d 1 where d and d will be estimated below and the 1 accounts for the dk l node itself the estimate of the utility of the c neighbor thus becomes p c d 1 d 1 0 8 of 24 and we compare the center node dk l s utility with the estimate from one of its c neighbors via the fermi function so that the estimated probability of the dk l node changing its state in this consideration is d k l 1 1 exp pd p c 1 1 exp lu k l 1 u d meanwhile transitions by a strategy update out of the ck l rely on the utility of a ck l node pc l 0 k l 1 and estimating the utility of one of the d neighbors via the numbers and types of its neighbors we denote the expected number of c neighbors of this d neighbor including the ck l node in question by c 1 and the number of d neighbors of this d neighbor as c both of which will be estimated below with this notation the expected utility of one of the d neighbors is p d c 1 1 u c u and the fermi function estimate for the probability of the ck l node changing its state in this comparison becomes c k l 1 1 exp pc p d 1 1 exp k l c 1 1 u cu the third to sixth terms in the ck l equation are the effects of one of the neighbors changing its state and thus leading to a change of the total quantity of ck l similar to the above in order to make estimates of the transition probabilities we need a variety of estimates of the numbers and types of the neighbors neighbors which we denote as follows we use c to provide the expected number of d neighbors of a cc edge as c k l k l lck l k l k l ck l similarly d denotes the expected number of d neighbors of the c node in a cd edge by d k l l 2 ck l k l lck l meanwhile c and d estimate the numbers of c neighbors of the d node of a cd edge or of a dd edge respectively c k l k l 2 dk l k l k l dk l d k l l k l dk l k l ldk l similarly c and d provide the expected numbers of d neighbors of the d node of a cd edge or of a dd edge respectively while c and d give the numbers of c neighbors of a cc edge or the c node of a cd edge respectively c k l k l ldk l k l k l dk l 9 of 24 d k l l 2 dk l k l ldk l c k l k l 2 ck l k l k l ck l d k l l k l ck l k l lck l to compute the corresponding transition probability in each term let us first consider the fermi function factors on the second line in equation 3 2 specified by cd cc 1 1 exp pcd ccd c where pcd ccd c 1 1 u c u and c 1 2 ncc nc 0 ncd nc that is this transition probability considers a d neighbor of the center ck l class and we suppose this d neighbor has c 1 neighbors in state c including the center ck l node and c in state d then we estimate this d node s utility and compare it with its typical c neighbor that is the average utility c we note for emphasis here that other choices could have been made in this estimate specifically we explicitly know that one of the c neighbors of this d node is the center ck l node an alternative formulation of the ame system could be formed that separates out the state change of the d neighbor in comparison with the ck l center thus removing the 1 contribution from its state changes through interaction with other c nodes in order to keep the equations just a little simpler and because of the good approximation we observe in our results below we continue to employ the simpler estimate here we similarly estimate the fermi function factors on the third line in equation 3 2 as cc cd 1 1 exp pcc cdc d where pcc cdc c 1 1 c 0 and d 1 u ncd nd u 2 ndd nd in analogy to the above argument we consider a c neighbor of the center ck l class and suppose this c node has c 1 neighbors in state c including the center node and c in state d we estimate this c node s utility and compare it with the average utility of a d node d the last line in the ck l equation 3 2 describes the rewiring effect the class ck l 1 flows to ck l when the center node c drops one of its defecting neighbors and rewires randomly to another c simi larly the ck l count decreases when the center node c drops one of its defecting neighbors and rewires randomly to another c if the rewiring instead links to another d node these counts do not change finally a ck 1 l node becomes ck l if it is the recipient of a rewired edge from another c node while 10 of 24 x l r x l r r b fig 4 illustrations of nodes undergoing active and passive rewiring left active rewiring before the rewiring node x is in class ck l cooperator of degree k with l defecting neighbors suppose one of x s discordant edges is selected and x actively breaks that edge shared with a defective neighbor rewiring to a random node in the network if node x rewires to a node of state c as depicted here then node x moves to class ck l 1 we recall that only c nodes actively rewire in the present model right passive rewiring before the rewiring node x is in class ck l suppose in the rewiring process node x is passively rewired through the activity of another c node in the network then node x moves to class ck 1 l the ck l count decreases if a ck l receives a rewired edge the first group of square bracketed terms on this line corresponds to the center node actively rewiring to some other node in the network while the second group in square brackets describes the center node passively receiving a rewired edge through the action of some other node in the network fig 3 illustrates these active and passive rewiring processes shifting our focus to the six flows in and out of the set depicted in the center of the lower row of fig 3 we similarly obtain equation 3 3 for the dk l compartment the resulting system contains 2 kmax 1 2 coupled differential equations where kmax is the maximum degree a node can have in the network usually the necessary value of kmax for good accuracy depends on network structure and the mean degree here we choose kmax 50 we numerically solve these differential equations to semi analytically approximate the evolution of the system using the ode 45 solver in matlab until the solutions reach steady state while we consider pa and ame approaches here we note that 70 used an approach for studying adaptive sis networks that treated the links as the objects classifying them according to the disease states while tracking the degree and number of infected neighbors at both end nodes this link based method could generally improve the accuracy compared to ame however it also increases the number of coupled equations from o k 2 max to o k 4 max where kmax is the maximum degree in the network 4 simulations of the cd switching model to test the accuracy of the approximations we study simulated dynamics on networks with n 1 000 nodes and m 5 000 edges that is the mean degree of the network is fixed to be k 2 m n 10 we set the parameter 30 in the fermi function used for imitating strategies we study dynamics for different initial fractions of defectors denoted by we consider 0 5 first and explore the 11 of 24 influence of this parameter later we draw the initial networks from an erdo s re nyi g n m random graph model of n nodes and m edges distributed uniformly and independently between the nodes for large n the initial degree distribution is approximated by the poisson distribution of mean k with the probability of a selected node having degree k being pk k ke k k in the present model updating only discordant edges i e cd the dynamics stop when there are no discordant edges remaining unless stated otherwise we perform 1 000 simulations for each condition and report the average 4 1 final level of cooperation to study the effect of the cost benefit ratio u and strategy update rate w we focus on the level of cooperation obtained in the final stationary states of the model starting from an initial fraction of defectors 0 5 in fig 5 we present heat maps generated by simulations and ame approximations of the final fractions of cooperating nodes and cc links as qualitatively expected the final fraction of cooperating nodes is higher when the possible additional payoff for defecting u is smaller when w is close to 0 we observe a moderate level of cooperators as expected because the discordant edges can resolve themselves by rewiring with fewer strategy updates away from the small values of u or w the final network states are dominated by defectors the ame approximation generally captures these high and low cooperation regions of the u w parameter space up to a modest displacement in the precise position of the phase transition in fig 6 we further explore the final level of cooperation and assess the accuracies of the two semi analytical approximations in the left panel of fig 6 we consider w 0 w 0 05 w 0 1 and w 0 5 plotting the final fraction of nodes in state c versus the cost benefit ratio u there are three sets of outcomes here simulations markers pa dotted lines and ame dashed lines for w 0 there are no strategy updates and the final fraction of c nodes is fixed at 1 for w 0 strategy updates come into play with larger values of the cost benefit ratio u driving stronger incentive for nodes to defect decreasing the final fraction of cooperators as seen in the figure the cases w 0 1 and w 0 5 include higher levels of cooperation at small u that decrease slightly as u increases before suddenly dropping to zero near u 0 2 and u 0 6 respectively this phenomenon is qualitatively captured by both pa and ame though the quantitative description from ame is much more accurate particularly in terms of these critical points in contrast the pa prediction of the fraction of cooperators drops to zero at much smaller values of u similarly in the case w 0 05 the level of cooperation in the simulation results decreases with increasing u but without the sharp dropoff in contrast to both the simulations and ame the pa result drops to zero around u 0 9 similarly in the right panel of fig 6 we plot the final fraction of cooperators c versus w for different cost benefit ratios u 0 u 0 01 u 0 2 and u 0 8 for w 0 no nodes update their strategies and the final fraction of c nodes is 1 0 5 larger w increases both the number of strategy updates and their overall effect on the final state in the cases u 0 and u 0 01 u is so small that there is almost no incentive to defect so in the strategy updating consideration c s and d s are holding everything else equal almost indistinguishable however in rewiring an edge the c node drops its d neighbor reducing the number of partners for d and over time the d nodes experience lower payoffs because the numbers of their neighbors decrease this decrease in degree results in lower total payoff increasing the probability of a d node changing to a c strategy leading to the dominance of c s for small u in contrast for u 0 8 the c nodes become more disadvantaged with increased w since the payoff of defecting is high and the final fraction of cooperators decreases to zero around w 0 1 the case u 0 2 is intermediate between the competing effects of these two extremes the final fraction of cooperators increases for values of w that are not too large due to the above described rewiring effect 12 of 24 u 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 w 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 f

and dashed lines again indicate simulations pa and ame respectively in both panels we observe that ame is typically more accurate than pa especially so near the phase transition where the fraction of cooperators goes to zero but sufficiently large strategy update rates that is fewer rewiring steps combined with an apparently sufficient incentive to defect leads to final network states dominated by defectors in the simulations this transition for u 0 2 appears to occur near w 0 4 while the pa and ame results qualitatively describe all of these effects well ame does a better job capturing this transition point taking these results together we note that in general the increased frequency of breaking and rewiring cd bonds i e smaller w can directly support cooperation in agreement with 60 61 as observed here both in terms of the apparent phase transition and the behavior at large u in the right panel of fig 6 but we also note that the results include situations where increasing this frequency decreasing w decreases the total level of cooperation because of the complex interplay in the model dynamics 4 2 network dynamics having explored the populations in the final states we consider how the networks evolve to those states specifically we investigate the evolution of five fundamental quantities of the networks the fractions of nodes in states c and d and the fractions of edges that are cc cd and dd we recall that the total numbers of nodes and edges are constant during the dynamics requiring both c d fractions and cc cd dd fractions to be equal to 1 we visualize the average trajectories through this phase space for a collection of different u w parameters in fig 7 starting from an initial fraction of defectors 0 5 distributed across an erdo s re nyi g n m random graph comparing simulations with pa and ame predictions as such the initial fraction of cc dd and cd edges is 0 25 0 25 and 0 5 respectively that is all networks start at c 0 5 cc 0 25 cd 0 5 as the

both approximations are qualitatively incorrect for the case u 0 5 w 0 1 recalling the simulation and ame results in the fig 5 phase diagram we note that this parameter set is within the relatively narrow range between the observed location of the phase transition and the ame prediction 4 3 degree distributions the ame method utilizes more information and has higher computational cost than pa but as we have seen it generally provides a better approximation for the current model moreover and unlike pa ame explicitly includes information about degree distributions in fig 8 we plot the final state degree distributions of c and d nodes comparing the simulations and ame predictions in each case since we initialize with random strategies on the erdo s re nyi g n m random graph model the initial degree distributions are approximately poisson for large n we examine degree distributions in the final states revisiting the same parameters considered previously u 0 2 w 0 1 u 0 2 w 0 3 u 0

trajectory of the dynamics in this case above fig 7 in the final state of this case d nodes dominate the whole network with no c nodes left in the other three cases although the ame predictions are not as accurate we can still see the ame provides a qualitative picture of the final degree distribution once again the worst case of the four parameter sets visualized here is the u 0 5 w 0 1 where

lines by construction all results in these panels should connect the upper left and lower right corners because when 0 respectively 1 there are no d c nodes no discordant edges and no dynamics in the left panel for the different u curves the final fraction of cooperators first gradually decreases and then drops to zero suddenly at different values of ame predicts this qualitative behavior for dif ferent levels of u moreover fixing w 0 1 smaller u results in higher cooperation since the incentive of defecting is less when u is small in the right panel fixing u 0 2 the diagonal line is the case w 0 where there are no strategy updates and the cooperation level remains the same during the evolution for small and moderate w the curves decrease with increasing though more quickly for smaller w followed by a sharp drop to zero at decreasing values of for increased w when w is large greater rates of strategy updates the final cooperative level drops to zero for all non zero as we show in this panel the ame curves suddenly drop to zero when w 0 4 17 of 24 5 a model variant with dd rewiring in this section we study a slightly different variant of the partner switching evolution game model also introduced by 11 where dd edges can also rewire as defector nodes seek out new partners that they might better exploit we are particularly interested in how this additional rewiring affects the final cooperation level in this variant each time step starts by uniformly at random selecting from the union of cd and dd edges recall that only cd edges were selected in the original model above if a cd edge is picked the dynamics proceed as in the original model with probability w the strategy update process happens otherwise that is with probability 1 w the c node along this edge unilaterally drops the partnership with its d neighbor and rewires to another node in contrast if a dd edge is picked then with probability w nothing happens there is no strategy update otherwise that is with probability 1 w one of the two d ends selected with equal probability drops the connection and rewires uniformly at random to another node in the network to whom it is not already connected we note that the total numbers of nodes n and edges m remain constant as in the original model this variant model stops evolving when there are no cd or dd edges remaining in the system that is all edges in a final frozen state are cc however this does not require that all d nodes are removed from the system only that they are each left isolated with no connections another possibility in which the model variant as stated above never reaches a stopping condition is that the system evolves to a statistically stationary state where all c nodes have been removed so that all edges are dd edges and the continued rewiring of these dd edges simply serves to repeatedly randomize the network of defector nodes since in this case there are no c nodes left to emulate in a strategy update nor to connect to in a rewiring we do not consider the dynamics further beyond this event both of these cases are visualized in fig 10 in the left panel the c nodes own all of the edges having isolated the exploitation efforts of the d nodes in the right panel only d nodes remain and all edges are dd 5 1 semi analytical methods of approximation as before we study this model variant with a combination of simulations and approximate analytic models comparing the pair approximation pa and approximate master equation ame approaches with simulation results following the notation of the original model in sec 3 the pa equations for this variant become dnc dt w ncd tanh 2 c d dncc dt w ncd c d 2 ncd ncc nc d c ncd ncd nd c d 1 w nc n ncd dndd dt w ncd d c 2 ncd ndd nd c d ncd ncd nc d c 1 w nc n ndd 5 1 where we note the only difference between equation 5 1 and equation 3 1 is the appearance of the last term in the dndd dt equation this term captures the possibility in this variant model for a d node to dismiss its defective partner and rewire to a c node thus decreasing the dd count 18 of 24 fig 10 visualization of stationary states of the model variant with dd rewiring for n 1 000 nodes m 5 000

and 3 3 account for the rewiring of dd edges accounting for the rates of d nodes abandoning d neighbors and rewiring to c nodes d nodes passively gaining new connections through this rewiring and d nodes being abandoned by their d neighbors note the 1 2 factors in the last two lines of the dk l equation accounting for an individual node on a dd keeping and losing the edge 5 2 final level of cooperation as before we compare the final fraction of cooperators in the simulations versus the pa and ame predictions in the left panel of fig 11 we consider w 0 w 0 05 w 0 1 and w 0 5 plotting the fraction of c nodes in the final states versus the cost benefit ratio u in the right panel we fix values of u and vary w again markers indicate simulation results dotted lines are from the pa equations and dashed lines are from ame 20 of 24 comparing fig 11 for this variant with the results in fig 6 the inclusion of dd rewiring here leads to slightly larger final fractions of c nodes for small w 0 in particular whereas an existing dd link in the original model can only be changed if the state of one of the two d nodes changes in a strategy update the dd rewiring in this variant increases the numbers of cd edges and thus leaves open the possibility of c nodes becoming more favorable because of their yet higher degree however for larger values of w the more rapid rate of strategy updating leads to defectors dominating the system before the cooperators can gain any advantage from increased degrees for further comparison we consider the final fractions of c nodes and cc edges for different com binations of u and w in fig 12 as compared with the similar plots in fig 5 while many of the general features remain the same in the presence of this dd rewiring variant a notable difference is in the final fraction of cc edges for small w in particular at w 0 no strategy updates the original model results visualized in fig 5 limit to a final cc level of 0 75 since the initial dd edges at 0 25 for 0 5 cannot ever rewire under these settings but these edges of course do rewire in the dd rewiring variant leading cc to limit to 1 as w 0 6 conclusion we have investigated a node based prisoner s dilemma game played on a network coevolving with player strategy updates our study includes two model variants for rewiring one where only cd edges can rewire by c nodes dropping a link to a d neighbor in favor of a new partner and a variant where dd edges can also rewire we explore the parameter space to investigate the competing effects of strategy updates and partner switching as well as the initial levels of cooperation versus defection we compare our simulations to the existing pair approximation pa developed in 11 and we develop an approximation using approximate master equations ame to more accurately capture the transitions between the properties of the final states of these models we also use the ame method to estimate the final state degree distributions for different parameters we are particularly interested in the features that determine the final level of cooperation and overall utility in the network revisiting fig 6 and the corresponding results for the model variant in fig 11 it is clear that the most effective way to increase the final fraction of cooperators is to directly reduce the cost benefit ratio u so that players do not have as much incentive to defect alternatively if the strategy update rate w is small enough the effects of rewiring give greater advantages to c nodes as they accumulate larger numbers of playing partners which then results in larger numbers of cooperators through the strategy updates of course one can also directly decrease the initial fraction of defectors the question of how to maximize the total utility or payoff relates to the types of edges in the partner switching evolutionary game model we study here the total number of nodes and edges remain fixed no matter how the networks and node states change utility comes from every edge in the network with each cc cd and dd edge contributing from the two nodes 2 1 u and 2 u respectively where u 0 1 with no cd edges in the final state maximizing the final overall utility reduces to maximizing the number of cc links in particular comparing the right panels of figs 5 and 12 for the two model variants whether or not dd edges can rewire significantly affects the cc count and thus the total system utility for small strategy update rates 21 of 24 u 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 w 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 f in a l fr a c ti o n o f c o o

clearly apparent grid artifacts as in the original model without dd rewiring fig 5 while some discrepancies between simulation and ame results are clearly present we note in particular that the
