s palasek non cooperativity in bayesian social learning stan palasek princeton university july 2014 abstract we describe a bayesian model for social learning of a random variable in which agents might observe each other over a directed network the outcomes produced are compared to those from a model in which observations occur randomly over a complete graph in both cases we observe a nontrivial level of observation which maximizes learning though individuals have strong incentive to defect from the societal optimum the implications of such competition over information commons are discussed i introduction trends and fads though at times ill informed are ubiquitous features of hu man societies the mathematical exam ination of the origins of these trends as cascades of questionable wisdom was per haps pioneered in 1992 by banerjee 1 and independently bikhchandani et al 2 al though it is rational for agents to observe the actions of others and to update their own beliefs accordingly banerjee notes the dilemma that the very act of trying to use the information contained in the decisions made by others makes each person s de cision less responsive to her own informa tion and hence less informative to others vives similarly showed that when agents observations are governed by a benevolent organizer social learning is more effective than when each individual is acting strictly in his or her own interest the observed in efficiency is a manifestation of an underin vestment in production of public informa tion which limits exploration of unpop ular decisions and propagates herding 3 these results may go a long way in ex plaining the emergence of societal trends which may seem irrational to those with access to a different stream of information indeed theories concerning social learning have found a number of applications includ ing finance 4 5 policy 6 and the adop tion of new ideas and technologies in the developing world 7 8 9 ii social learning model we consider a system similar to that in salge polani 10 here there are n slots of which one hides a reward which is being sought by n agents at each time step with probability p 1 the reward is randomly relocated a random agent a is then selected uniformly and indepen dently who observes the slot s that it be lieves most likely to contain the reward all m agents perform a na ve bayes update the ath agent s based on the result of its ob servation of s and the other agents based on the fact that a elected to observe s this 1 ar x iv 1 40 7 05 19 v 1 cs s i 2 j ul 2 01 4 s palasek update takes into account the possibility that the target has moved removing the risk that agents get stuck having unsuc cessfully checked all n loci as discussed in 10 an agent s actions are chosen in consideration of its previous observations and therefore contain poten tially useful information for instance in a simple model with no bayesian updating and p 0 it can be shown that the condi tional probability of the reward being at s given that an agent chooses to observe s is twice the conditional probability given that an agent choses to observe a slot other than s we might expect that introducing social updating only injects more useful informa tion into agents choices described so far has been a model for social learning where the underlying social network is the complete graph of order m more generally we can consider the same process but with agents constrained to per form bayesian updates only for those with whom they are connected on a graph g note that at times we will allow g to be di rected ie for some perhaps artificial rea son an agent i employs information from j but not vice versa we make several key changes to salge polani s model which we believe make this formulation more realistic first here we do not reset the beliefs of an agent once it discovers the location of the reward we admit that occasionally injecting maxi mum entropy makes sense when p 0 since the game would otherwise be solved and quickly reach a steady state however the fact that the location of the reward changes simultaneously for the entire ensemble sug gests that all the agents are within a single environment and it would therefore be un natural for some to abruptly forget infor mation or be replaced second here we use a social network to limit information consumption as in 11 12 13 rather than throwing out ob servations with a uniform probability 1 po reminiscent of 14 although the lat ter model is appealing in the sense that it provides a linear continuum between a non social situation po 0 or all isolated nodes and complete observability po 1 or g is complete it is far more natu ral for agents to form social networks and learn from those with whom they are con nected indeed one might expect the uni formly random information selection to be analogous to learning on an erdo s re nyi random graph since they must both ex hibit low diameter clustering and a bi nomial degree distribution the authors suggested the random ignorance model as something that social agents might form strategically rather than something that is inherent within their decision making pro cesses the plausibility of which we will in vestigate later finally here we order the agent obser vations uniformly and independently rather than in a predetermined sequence this change was necessitated by the present use of the network model in lieu of random ob servation the latter formulation is sym metric because the choice of information disposal is i i d the arbitrary designation of an order is therefore of little concern in the current model however the underlying graph is generally asymmetric so an arbi trary ordering of the agents may introduce harmful bias random ordering avoids this complication iii graph connectivity results a major result of 10 is that maximal learn ing occurs at some intermediate 0 po 1 we will illustrate an analogous fact for our 2 s palasek network based model with the modifica tions detailed above in particular we ex ecute the described process for graphs cho sen uniformly at random from the set of graphs with n vertices and i edges for each i 1 2 3 n 2 figure 1 simulation results for n 15 p 0 01 and a bayes factor of 2 between positive and neg ative observations depicted are the results of 50 trials each a mean of 1000 iterations at each edge count from 1 to 100 the results are shown in figure 1 we see as in 10 that there indeed exists an optimal quantity of information to be collected by social agents as learning is maximized when the graph has approxi mately 25 edges or when the mean de gree is 3 3 for very disconnected networks agents have little access to the information contained in others actions which as we argued has a bayes factor of at least two conversely when the network has most of its possible edges present we observe that herding behavior to incorrect slots is preva lent this is illustrated in figure 2 which depicts the simulation over a complete net work during which the agents spend most of their time at only a handful of spots which rarely contain the reward figure 2 the location of the treasure black and the slot chosen at a given time orange for the same parameter set as figure 1 representative data for a society over a complete graph are shown and misinformed herding behavior is evident on these grounds alone 10 suggests that rational agents might voluntarily ig nore information to achieve po 1 or in this setting a non complete graph in the next sections we will evaluate whether agents truly have any incentive to do so or whether defecting from an optimal configu ration would suit one s individual interests at the expense of those of the group iv stability over complete g the notion that agents freely decide whose information to take into account and to what extent suggests that by default they have at their disposal more information than they would optimally use in this section we will therefore take the com plete graph as a starting point of our in vestigation of stability and consider devi ations thence should we see that from here no one has incentive to discard infor mation then we must conclude that the complete graph constitutes a stable equilib rium however the prevalence of harmful herding as demonstrated in the last section 3 s palasek would lead one to expect that agents are eager to defect from complete networks so as to minimize their susceptibility to cas cades of false information we test this by modifying a complete graph such that a test node originally of degree m 1 instead has degree i for i 0 1 2 m 1 since the original graph was complete and there fore symmetric there is a unique unlabeled graph for each i this will be an instance as we hinted at earlier in which the graph is directed except when i 14 since an agent s decision to disregard data from its neighbor has no bearing on its neighbor s reciprocal observation figure 3 simulation results for every possi ble single agent deviation from a complete graph depicted are time series for both the defecting agent orange and the remaining m 1 collectively black the parameter set is the same as that from figure 1 both series for t 1 follow power laws with r 2 0 999 with forms p 0 0293 d 0 177 individual and p 0 0261 d 0 134 society we do not show data for the individual non defecting agents for they vary in proportion with the aggre gate data the result of the simulation is shown in figure 3 as expected single agents are generally rewarded for severing ties from a complete network the only robust ex ception is in the transition from maintain ing one connection to becoming isolated in which the defecting node takes a slight loss in performance by disconnecting itself com pletely furthermore we see that the im provement in the defector s performance is mirrored in the welfare gain experienced by the rest of society we must then ask given that deviations from the complete network are incentivised to what density the net work must be cleared for no defection to be motivated should such a stable network exist at all v stability over sparse g next rather than beginning with a com plete graph we will instead consider the the highest performance graph with edge count near the extremum of figure 1 chosen out of the 100 000 random 15 order graphs ex amined this graph call it g 0 is depicted in figure 4 and it may be near the equilib rium should one exist figure 4 g 0 the highest performing graph with edge count near 25 among the 100 000 sampled graphs depicted in figure 1 the test vertex is highlighted in red for the purpose of illustration we will arbitrarily designate the node highlighted in red as the test vertex which will defect from its current situation in g 0 during our experiments in particular we will repeat the simulation from the previous section upon this graph g 0 by varying the order 4 s palasek of the text vertex this procedure differs in that now inasmuch as the starting graph is asymmetric there is not a unique graph with the required properties we will there fore select a uniformly random degree inclu sively between 0 and m and then choose the network randomly from the class of graphs in which the test vertex has the selected de gree and connections between non test ver tices are unchanged figure 5 learning performance over optimal graph g 0 with the test model s connections sys tematically modified 50 000 trials were executed with the same parameter set used in figure 1 de picted are both the performance of the test node or ange and the rest of the network black both time series are fit to power laws with r 2 0 9999 with forms p 0 0353 d 0 0466 individual and p 0 0339 d 0 00762 society figure 5 depicts the results which show that the test node can expect a robust in crease in its average performance by ob serving more agents meanwhile as long as the test agent is connected to someone its behavior ceases to have a measurable ef fect on the success of the others because the test agent already occupying one of the better connected nodes in the network is motivated to expand his observation of the other agents we conclude that this network does not present a stable environment when individuals are free to adjust their informa tion consumption figure 6 confirms that this observation is a general one and that all nodes not just the test node of figure 4 are motivated to defect to complete obser vation figure 6 mean performance improvements for each node of g 0 upon independently defecting to complete observation the same parameter set from figure 1 is employed with 1000 trials for each node the outlying datum is that of the isolated node seen in figure 4 vi stability with random observation one might come to believe that the insta bility we have identified when individuals are free to choose which information to con sider is a feature of our graph model and is not present in the random observation model of 10 here we will show that the phenomenon is present regardless now instead of each agent forming its beliefs according to its connections in a di rected graph it will use information from a given agent at a given time with some probability po as noted before varying po between 0 and 1 interpolates between the null and complete graphs in order to understand the incentives of agents to de viate from the po that is ideal for society as a whole we first set all agents obser vation probabilities to p 0 0 196 the op timal probability identified among 10 000 5 s palasek trials with the same parameter set that we have used throughout we then allow the observation probability of a single test node to vary 1 the results are depicted in fig ure 7 we conclude that the test agent and therefore every agent by symmetry of the model has incentive to increase its ob servation probability far past the optimum for society therefore despite po 0 196 being ideal for society as a whole it will not be adhered to by rational agents who can freely choose their observation rates figure 7 learning performance for test node as it defects from the societal ideal po 0 196 10 000 trials were executed each time selecting a random observation probability for the test node data are subjected to exponential moving averaging with a smoothing factor of 0 0005 vii game theory up to this point we have been employ ing language as though we are examining a competitive game without being explicit about its components it will become ap parent as we do so how naturally our for mulation can be viewed as a normal form game let the game have m players corre sponding to the society s agents a pure strategy profile is any directed graph g over m labeled nodes in which the ith agent has control over the ith row of g s adjacency matrix the payoffs are defined as the av erage performance for each agent when the described simulation is carried out over g 2 we assume that the agents information on the simulation s rules including the value of p is complete 3 in terms of this game we can summarize the results of the pre vious two sections by noting that neither the complete graph nor g 0 is a nash equi librium since someone and in fact every one gains a profit on average by defecting furthermore the complete graph is pareto inefficient by figure 3 we might wish to find a stable outcome ie a nash equilib rium but as we are considering only pure strategies nash s theorem does not guar antee their existence 18 to find equilib ria exhaustively is intractable for the num ber of unlabeled undirected graphs when m 15 is on the order of 1019 19 when directed edges are introduced the space be comes larger still by orders of magnitude we may still however computationally identify an equilibrium within the obser vation probability model here although the strategy space is continuous it is one dimensional and thus easy to search we proceed as follows let pt be the observa tion probability used by the test individual and ps the probability for the rest of soci ety let the expected performance of the test individual be given by u ps pt in equilibrium no individual has incentive to 1 the choice of the test node does not matter because here there is no underlying graph to introduce asymmetry 2 it is reasonable to expect that agents act upon the expectation of their utility 15 for a treatment that does not neglect the stochastic nature of learning performance one might consider games with fuzzy payoffs see for instance 16 3 one need not make this assumption see dekel et al 17 who examine learning without it 6 s palasek deviate from ps therefore we seek a solu tion ps pt 0 1 2 to ps arg max pt u ps pt 1 clearly when po 0 there is no widespread risk of herding so the test agent s best response is a pt near 1 furthermore as we showed in section iv when po 1 the best response is a near zero level of observation these facts combined with the continuity of the right hand side of 1 and the interme diate value theorem would imply that there exists a solution to the equation how ever due to the prevalence of phase behav ior as the degree of connectivity of societies varies 20 we cannot be certain as to how the function behaves in practice with this in mind we evaluate the function in silico the left and right hand sides of 1 are shown respectively in orange and black in figure 8 figure 8 the test node s best response observa tion probability is depicted at various societal ob servation probabilities the data represent 25 000 random samples of values for ps and pt the best response function is fitted to an exponential with p t 0 89 exp 2 84 ps 1 is satisfied when the best response series black coincides with the locus ps pt orange viii discussion we as in 10 determine that maximal so cial learning occurs when not all informa tion is taken into account by all agents the authors go on to detail the reasonable corol lary that rational agents will voluntarily discard much of their information between 70 and 80 according to both our analy ses doing so gives individuals own ob servations greater weight in their bayesian beliefs thus globally limiting the impetus for herding which as seen in figure 2 is often to the wrong location our objec tion to this reasoning is as follows a single agent by defecting and letting the extent of its observation be universal or nearly so has little effect on the prevalence of herding as it is necessarily a population wide phenomenon however its defection yields in its favor a significant improvement in its ability to take advantage of emerg ing trends since the propensity for false information cascades has hardly increased the defecting agent enjoys greater perfor mance such an argument applies to any and therefore every member of the society consequently we cannot expect rational in dividuals that have the ability to increase the extent of their observation to adhere to the welfare maximizing level of information consumption this dilemma is highly reminiscent of hardin s tragedy of the commons 21 there is a common resource in our sys tem information uncontaminated by neg ative information cascades acting in its own self interest each agent is strongly mo tivated to maximally consume this informa tion see figures 5 6 and 7 however as the common pool of information be comes over consumed small random flocks to potentially incorrect loci are accentuated and herding behavior emerges thus the re source is of far lesser use 7 s palasek as hardin famously pointed out there is no technical solution to such problems of overconsumption fortunately nature seems to impose a limit herself for hu man societies are typically arranged in non complete social networks this raises the question of whether the properties exhib ited by graphs of actual human commu nities are particularly conducive to such learning one might also wonder if such learning processes played any role in the adoption of technologies by early man which would have in turn correlated with survival probabilities why defectors did not invade populations of mutual cooperators for this we refer to the extensive literature on the evolution of cooperation in which these same questions are addressed in a general setting 22 23 24 references 1 banerjee a v 1992 a
