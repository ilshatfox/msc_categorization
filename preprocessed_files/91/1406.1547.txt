abstract it is assumed that under suitable economic and information theoretic conditions market exchange rates are free from arbitrage commodity markets in which trades occur over a complete graph are shown to be trivial we therefore examine the vector space of no arbitrage exchange rate ensembles over an arbitrary connected undirected graph consideration is given for the minimal information for determination of an exchange rate ensemble we conclude with a topical discussion of exchanges in which our analyses may be relevant including the emergent but highly regulated and therefore not a complete graph market for digital currencies i introduction consider a set of goods with a fixed exchange rate defined for each pair traded among ra tional investors provided that there is com plete information and the goods have objective worth as might for instance a currency it is necessary that the rates be such that no market participant can make a strict profit by execut ing a trade which ends in the same denomina tion with which it began otherwise because the quantity of each good is conserved and the investors by assumption have identical pref erences executing the trade would leave the others taking an effective loss we will refer to this assumption as the no arbitrage con dition 1 p 322 although history shows that it is at times possible to profit from differen tial cross and direct exchange rates due to for instance asymmetric information 2 3 we will for now neglect these uncommon compli cations ellerman notes that the arbitrage free prop erty of such an exchange is equivalent both to the system being path independent and to the exchange rates taking on their trivial cross rate values 4 these truths will become ev ident given the formulation presented here though we will proceed in the manner of mirowski and consider only undirected net works in which a reciprocal exists for each po tential trade 5 under the presumption that all relevant economies are free from arbitrage we will further examine the structure of the space of plausible exchange ensembles from a graph theoretic perspective of particular interest are markets without a universal cur rency ie graphs without a vertex connected to all others in such an economy it is meaning less to speak of price since no denomination is universal although we will prove a theorem that provides an equivalent alternative the resulting ambiguity over the value of a com modity is of interest to postmodern philoso phers who have themselves studied this sys tem 6 ii the space of arbitrage free ensembles definition 1 let g be a connected nth order graph with vertices g 1 g 2 gn which represents the exchanges between the n goods that may oc cur define an exchange matrix associated with g 1 http arxiv org abs 1406 1547 v 1 mailto spalasek princeton edu s palasek as any n n matrix e of positive reals where e i j is the exchange rate of gj to gi or equivalently the price of gi in units of gj with the additional prop erty that if i j g then ei j 1 furthermore for an exchange matrix e define its additive ex change matrix e to be the n n matrix of reals with ei j ln e i j definition 2 define a no arbitrage matrix over a connected graph g as an exchange matrix e such that for any closed walk upon g over the vertices gn 1 gn 2 gnt gn 1 we have e nt n 1 t 1 i 1 e ni ni 1 1 1 or equivalently for the additive exchange matrix ent n 1 t 1 i 1 eni ni 1 0 2 note that definition 2 considers 1 and 2 over all closed walks on g even those with repeated vertices not counting the repetition of gi 1 however because a closed walk with repeated vertices can trivially be fragmented into a sequence of closed walks without re peated vertices and 1 and 2 apply associa tively it is equivalent to consider the equations over non repeating closed walks cycles definition 3 let m g be the set of all additive no arbitrage matrices over the connected graph g lemma 4 m g is a subspace of the vector space of n n matrices over standard matrix operations proof choose any e e m g and c r and consider the matrix e c e evaluating it in the left hand side of 2 the terms sepa rate due to linearity again yielding zero fur thermore since both matrices are over g they contain zero entries wherever an edge is not in g therefore so does their linear combina tion thus all the conditions are satisfied for e c e m g so the space is closed under linear combination lemma 5 let g be an nth order connected graph and e an additive no arbitrage matrix on it then for any i j 1 ei i 0 2 ei j ej i proof if i j g then by definition 1 ei j 0 and the second statement is satisfied oth erwise if i j g then we can apply def inition 2 to the closed walk i j i to obtain ei j ej i 0 and the second statement is again satisfied letting i j the first state ment follows from the second note that if i is not reflexively connected to itself the first statement of the lemma holds not for any economically relevant reason but rather because we arbitrarily defined the en tries of e corresponding to non existent edges of g to be 0 this convention is nonetheless useful as it preserves m s additive and scalar multiplicative closure which we needed in the proof of lemma 4 definition 6 let g be a connected graph of order n and 1 ik jk n for k 1 2 t a col lection of ordered pairs i 1 j 1 i 2 j 2 it jt is a basis for g s additive exchange matrix if fixing the entries ei 1 j 1 ei 2 j 2 eit jt of the no arbitrage additive exchange matrix e of g uniquely and min imally determines the rest of the matrix we will refer to t as the dimension lemma 7 let g be the complete 1 graph of order n then for any k the entries k 1 k 2 k k 1 k k 1 k n 1 k n are a basis for the exchange matrix of g proof fix values for ek 1 through ek n exclud ing ek k consider i j satisfying i j g case 1 if i j k then ei j is determined by part 1 of lemma 5 case 2 suppose i k 6 j then ei j ek j is among the fixed values switching the roles of i and j is determined likewise up to a sign by the second part of lemma 5 case 3 suppose i j 6 k since 1 when we refer to a complete graph here and elsewhere it is irrelevant whether one includes or excludes the reflexive edges connecting each vertex to itself ie whether ones or zeros constitute the main diagonal of the adjacency matrix the main diagonal of the exchange matrix will in either case be zeros due either to no arbitrage over the reflexive loops or the convention of setting to zero the entries corresponding to absent edges 2 s palasek the graph is complete j k and k i are in g therefore gi gj gk gi form a closed walk and by definition 2 ei j ej k ek i 0 using the second part of lemma 5 this rearranges to ei j ek j ek i which is again determined in terms of the fixed values thus we ve shown that every entry of e is determined uniquely next we illustrate that a smaller collection of entries does not determine the exchange matrix uniquely let ei j ek j ek i 3 for all 1 i j k n then 2 becomes ek n 1 ek nt t 1 i 1 ek ni 1 ek ni 0 4 which telescopes to a tautology there fore such an exchange matrix is no arbitrage regardless of the choice of ek 1 ek 2 ek k 1 ek k 1 ek n 1 ek n we conclude that no smaller set could determine the exchange matrix uniquely thus both con ditions of definition 6 are met in the next lemma unlike before we will additionally refer to the standard linear alge bra definition of basis however the result will allow us to identify the definition 6 un derstanding of basis and dimension precisely with a basis for and the dimension of the space m g definition 8 let g be a connected graph of order n and i 1 j 1 i 2 j 2 it jt a basis for it for k 1 2 t define k to be the matrix uniquely determined by letting eik jk 1 and setting the rest of the basis entries to zero lemma 9 let g be a connected graph of order n with i 1 j 1 i 2 j 2 it jt and 1 2 k as in definition 8 then t k 1 ak k is the unique no arbitrage exchange matrix over g with ak at the entry ik jk for all k 1 2 t proof it follows from definition 8 that the kth matrix s ik jk entry is one and for m 6 k its im jm entry is zero in mathematical terms k im jm k m 5 therefore t k 1 ak k im jm t k 1 ak k im jm 6 t k 1 ak k m 7 am 8 by lemma 4 t k 1 ak k m g by defini tion 8 it is unique theorem 10 let g be a connected graph of order n with i 1 j 1 i 2 j 2 it jt and 1 2 k as in definition 8 then the col lection of matrices 1 2 t form a basis of m g proof we must show that every no arbitrage additive exchange matrix over g has a unique expression as a linear combination of the k by lemma 9 this is equivalent to the proposition that every no arbitrage ad ditive exchange matrix over g can be ex pressed with a unique choice of constants to fill the entries i 1 j 1 i 2 j 2 it jt this proposition is precisely the meaning of i 1 j 1 i 2 j 2 it jt being a basis as given by definition 6 corollary 11 let g be the complete graph and h a connected tree acyclic graph both of order n then dim m g dim m h n 1 9 proof the equality for g follows immediately from lemma 7 and theorem 10 by definition of a tree the only closed walks on h upon which we need to in voke 2 are those which double back on themselves ie those of the form i 1 i 2 ik 1 ik ik 1 i 2 i 1 for some k n linearity of 2 implies that it is neces sary and sufficient to check this condition with k 2 yielding anticommutativity as in lemma 5 as the sole restriction thus the ad ditive exchange has a degree of freedom for each edge of which there are n 1 for any tree 7 p 14 cor 1 5 3 then by theorem 10 dim m h n 1 3 s palasek theorem 12 if g is a connected graph then dim m g g 1 10 proof let n g the number of vertices in the graph g must contain a normal spanning tree 7 p 16 prop 1 5 6 call it hn 1 in recog nition of the fact that it has n 1 edges we will henceforth denote the number of edges of a graph by next construct a sequence of graphs hn 1 hn h g 1 h g with the following properties for n 1 i g 1 hi is a spanning subgraph of hi 1 2 hi 1 hi 1 3 h g g in other words the sequence of graphs from h g to hn 1 is the transformation of g into one of its spanning trees successively remov ing edges at each step since hn 1 is by def inition a subgraph of g such a sequence ev idently exists we will proceed by induction over the hi to show that each of the m hi and in particular m h g has dimension n 1 the base case in which i n 1 is given by corollary 11 for the inductive step suppose that for some i satisfying n 1 i g dim m hi n 1 let the edge k m be the singleton element of hi 1 hi there are three cases case 1 suppose k m the only new cycle is the reflexive loop k m k k the exchange matrix entry over which is trivially determined to be 0 thus the collection of en tries that form a basis of hi in the definition 6 sense likewise form one of hi 1 by theorem 10 they have equal dimension case 2 sup pose there is exactly one path from gk to gm consisting of distinct vertices call it c then the addition of the edge k m creates four cy cles on hi 1 that did not exist on hi k m k c k and their respective reversals analo gously to lemma 5 the no arbitrage condition on k m k implies ek m em k 11 thus all the edges in hi 1 are anticommuta tive so if a cycle satisfies 2 then its rever sal must as well we therefore see that the only nontrivial new constraint introduced by the edge k m is the no arbitrage condition on one direction of c k furthermore by 11 there is only one new unique variable to be determined consider the equation we referenced im posed by 2 on c k because hi is a span ning subgraph of hi 1 and a basis of size n 1 for hi s exchange matrix determines each of the variables that basis determines all of the variables in the no arbitrage equation except for ek m which in turn is determined by the equation we therefore see that hi 1 has a ba sis of size n 1 in the definition 6 sense so by theorem 10 dim m hi 1 n 1 case 3 suppose there is more than one path from gk to gm consisting of distinct vertices we will illustrate that additional paths impose no greater restriction than the single one we con sidered in the second case let c and c be two non identical paths from gk to gm on hi hi 1 now has two cycles that we did not con sider in case 2 c k and its reverse again by anticommutativity the no arbitrage equa tions imposed by these paths are equivalent furthermore observe that c c is a cy cle on hi where c is the reversal of the path c since the basis for hi provided for no arbitrage over this cycle as it does not assume the edge k m its no arbitrage equation can be assumed p q c c ep q 0 12 we may then split the equation over the two paths p q c ep q p q c ep q 13 thus the no arbitrage condition is equivalent over any two paths so the third case reduces to the second it follows by induction that dim m hi n 1 for n 1 i g let ting i g proves the theorem 4 s palasek iii discussion the cited literature s consideration of ex change rates over arbitrary networks see for instance 4 6 seems to rely on the premises both that complete graphs are too trivial to be of interest and that nontrivial underlying networks may exist ex papyro however the conditions formulated both implicitly and ex plicitly in the introduction may considerably limit the scope of the class of systems which our analyses may encompass first we re quired that all traders have the same prefer ences ie that they demand the same price for a given asset otherwise we would not have a fixed exchange matrix second in order to obtain a nontrivial here non sparse graph trades must occur between a variety of pairs of assets if there is a single commodity that is behaving as a universal currency then ev ery cross rate is immediately determined tri angularly the empirical existence of idiosyn cratic consumer preferences investment objec tives and information makes the first condi tion implausible american reality television provides an explicit counterexample see 8 furthermore the second condition obsolesced along with the bartering system in modern economies hence currency markets are the only logical applications where our consider ations might be relevant neglecting differen tial preferences for foreign goods a given cur rency has the same value across individuals my euro buys as many goods as your euro now we must contend only with the po tential of the underlying network to be not sparse enough certainly there are active ex changes between virtually every pair of con ventional currencies and as we showed in lemma 7 such complete no arbitrage net works are uniquely determined by the set of n 1 exchange rates with any given cur rency we might however turn our atten tion to unconventional electronic currencies 2 when included in the vertex set these cur rencies may fascinatingly not yield a com plete graph in may 2014 for instance the people s bank of china began urging banks to be wary of transactions in bitcoin a par ticularly prominent electronic currency in deed china s largest banks banned activities related to bitcoin trading 10 the edge in the market graph between the yuan and bit coin is therefore not present one might fur ther extend the network data permitting to include the elicit goods that make up a sig nificant fraction of transactions involving elec tronic currencies 11 one might expect that the popularity of resorting to alternate pay ment methods indicates an aversion to trading via traditional centralized currencies perhaps signaling additional absent edges we have so far considered only static mar ket equilibria allowing the discussion to re main in the context of currencies we will briefly discuss considerations for dynamics on exchange networks ellerman notes that the no arbitrage condition of equation 2 is for mally equivalent to kirchhoff s junction rule of electrodynamics 4 we must remember however that the economically relevant sys tem is multiplicative as in 1 it is therefore unrealistic to expect exchange rate dynamics akin to the charging of a circuit in response to changes in consumer demand or central bank supply rather we might imagine a set of ba sis entries e i 1 j 1 e i 2 j 2 e in 1 jn 1 perturbed according to e ik jk 7 e ik jk e ik jk 14 along with the observation from definition 1 that e i j exp ei j e 15 letting a be a third order tensor mapping a basis to its unique arbitrage free exchange ma trix linearity gives us e a e i 1 j 1 e in 1 jn 1 16 2 although the internal revenue service might disagree with this terminology 9 electronic currencies nonetheless conform to the conditions we outlined for them to fit within the scope of the model presented here 5 s palasek whence we may proceed to solve the dynamic equations though theorem 12 simplifies the calculation by guaranteeing that it is sufficient to know the changes to just n 1 independent entries one must be careful in determining precisely which entries change directly due to a supply or demand perturbation finally it may be of particular interest to apply these methods on so called scale free networks those graphs whose degree distri butions have power tails it is well established that this ubiquitous property arises natu rally in economic systems 12 and from simple stochastic network formation mecha nisms 13 additionally miroswski has found success examining arbitrage free systems with a cellular automaton model 5 which as he points out are conducive to graph models 14 p 240 and have been shown to produce asymptotic power tails 15 adapting the for mulation given here to be specific for such economically and socially realistic networks may be a promising line of future inquiry references 1 harrison m
