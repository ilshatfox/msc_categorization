turing trap brynjolfsson for daedalus 0 the turing trap the promise peril of human like artificial intelligence erik brynjolfsson stanford digital economy lab http brynjolfsson com forthcoming in d dalus spring 2022 in 1950 alan turing proposed an imitation game as the ultimate test of whether a machine was intelligent could a machine imitate a human so well that it s answers to questions indistinguishable from a human s 1 ever since creating intelligence that matches human intelligence has implicitly or explicitly been the goal of thousands of researchers engineers and entrepreneurs the benefits of human like artificial intelligence hlai include soaring productivity increased leisure and perhaps most profoundly a better understanding of our own minds but not all types of ai are human like in fact many of the most powerful systems are very different from humans and an excessive focus on developing and deploying hlai can lead us into a trap as machines become better substitutes for human labor workers lose economic and political bargaining power and become increasingly dependent on those who control the technology in contrast when ai is focused on augmenting humans rather than mimicking them then humans retain the power to insist on a share of the value created what s more augmentation creates new capabilities and new products and services ultimately generating far more value than merely human like ai while both types of ai can be enormously beneficial there are currently excess incentives for automation rather than augmentation among technologists business executives and policy makers 1 lan turing was far from the first to imagine human like machines according to legend 3 500 years ago d dalus constructed humanoid statues that were so lifelike that they moved and spoke by themselves 2 nearly every culture has its own stories of human like machines from yanshi s leather man described in the ancient chinese liezi text to the bronze talus of the argonautica and the towering clay mokkerkalfe of norse mythology the word robot first appeared in karel apek s influential play rossum s universal robots and derives from the czech word robota meaning servitude or work in fact in the first drafts of his play apek named them labori until his brother josef suggested substituting the word robot 3 of course it is one thing to tell tales about humanoid machines it is something else to create robots that do real work for all our ancestors inspiring stories we are the first generation to build and deploy real robots in large numbers 4 dozens of companies are working on robots as human like if not more so as those described in the ancient texts one might say that technology has advanced sufficiently to become indistinguishable from mythology 5 the breakthroughs in robotics depend not merely on more dexterous mechanical hands and legs and more perceptive synthetic eyes and ears but also on increasingly human like artificial intelligence powerful ai systems are crossing key thresholds matching humans in a growing number of fundamental tasks such as image recognition and speech recognition with applications from autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis to inventory management and product recommendations 6 ai is appearing in more and more products and processes 7 these breakthroughs are both fascinating and exhilarating they also have profound economic implications just as earlier general purpose technologies like the steam engine and a 2 electricity catalyzed a restructuring of the economy our own economy is increasingly transformed by ai a good case can be made that ai is the most general of all general purpose technologies after all if we can solve the puzzle of intelligence it would help solve many of the other problems in the world and we are making remarkable progress in the coming decade machine intelligence will become increasingly powerful and pervasive we can expect record wealth creation as a result replicating human capabilities is valuable not only because of its practical potential for reducing the need for human labor but also because it can help us build more robust and flexible forms of intelligence whereas domain specific technologies can often make rapid progress on narrow tasks they founder when unexpected problems or unusual circumstances arise that is where human like intelligence excels in addition hlai could help us understand more about ourselves we appreciate and comprehend the human mind better when we work to create an artificial one let s look more closely at how hlai could lead to a realignment of economic and political power the distributive effects of ai depend on whether it is primarily used to augment human labor or automate and replace it when ai augments human capabilities enabling people to do things they never could before then humans and machines are complements complementarity implies that people remain indispensable for value creation and retain bargaining power in labor markets and in political decision making in contrast when ai replicates and automates existing human capabilities machines become better substitutes for human labor and workers lose economic and political bargaining power entrepreneurs and executives who have access to 3 machines with capabilities that replicate those of human for a given task can and often will replace humans in those tasks a fully automated economy could in principle be structured to redistribute the benefits from production widely even to those who are no longer strictly necessary for value creation however the beneficiaries would be in a weak bargaining position to prevent a change in the distribution that left them with little or nothing they would depend precariously on the decisions of those in control of the technology this opens the door to increased concentration of wealth and power this highlights the promise and the peril of achieving hlai building machines designed to pass the turing test and other more sophisticated metrics of human like intelligence 8 on the one hand it is a path to unprecedented wealth increased leisure robust intelligence and even a better understanding of ourselves on the other hand if hlai leads machines to automate rather than augment human labor it creates the risk of concentrating wealth and power and with that concentration comes the peril of being trapped in an equilibrium where those without power have no way to improve their outcomes a situation i call the turing trap the grand challenge of the coming era will be to reap the unprecedented benefits of ai including its human like manifestations while avoiding the turing trap succeeding in this task requires an understanding of how technological progress affects productivity and inequality why the turing trap is so tempting to different groups and a vision of how we can do better i pioneer nils nilsson noted that achieving real human level ai would necessarily imply that most of the tasks that humans perform for pay could be automated 9 in the same article he called for a focused effort to create such machines writing that achieving a 4 human level ai or strong ai remains the ultimate goal for some researchers and he contrasted this with weak ai which seeks to build machines that help humans 10 not surprisingly given these monikers work toward strong ai attracted many of the best and brightest minds to the quest of implicitly or explicitly fully automating human labor rather than assisting or augmenting it for the purposes of this essay rather than strong versus weak ai let us use the terms automation versus augmentation in addition i will use hlai to mean human like artificial intelligence not human level ai because the latter mistakenly implies that intelligence falls on a single dimension and perhaps even that humans are at the apex of that metric in reality intelligence is multidimensional a 1970 s pocket calculator surpasses the most intelligent human in some ways such as multiplication as does a chimpanzee short term memory at the same time machines and animals are inferior to human intelligence on myriad other dimensions the term artificial general intelligence agi is often used as a synonym for hlai however taken literally it is the union of all types of intelligences able to solve types of problems that are solvable by any existing human animal or machine that suggests that agi is not human like the good news is that both automation and augmentation can boost labor productivity that is the ratio of value added output to labor hours worked as productivity increases so do average incomes and living standards as do our capabilities for addressing challenges from climate change and poverty to health care and longevity 11 mathematically if the human labor used for a given output declines toward zero then labor productivity would grow to infinity 12 the bad news is that no economic law ensures everyone will share this growing pie although pioneering models of economic growth 13 14 assumed that technological change was 5 neutral in practice technological change can disproportionately help or hurt some groups even if it is beneficial on average 15 in particular the way the benefits of technology are distributed depends to a great extent on how the technology is deployed and the economic rules and norms that govern the equilibrium allocation of goods services and incomes when technologies automate human labor they tend to reduce the marginal value of workers contributions and more of the gains go to the owners entrepreneurs inventors and architects of the new systems in contrast when technologies augment human capabilities more of the gains go to human workers 16 a common fallacy is to assume that all or most productivity enhancing innovations belong in the first category automation however the second category augmentation has been far more important throughout most of the past two centuries one metric of this is the economic value of an hour of human labor its market price as measured by median wages has grown more than ten fold since 1820 17 an entrepreneur is willing to pay much more for a worker whose capabilities are amplified by a bulldozer than one who can only work with a shovel let alone with bare hands in many cases not only wages but also employment grow with the introduction of new technologies with the invention of jet engines pilot productivity in passenger miles per pilot hour grew immensely rather than reducing the number of employed pilots the technology spurred demand for air travel so much that the number of pilots grew although this pattern is comforting past performance does not guarantee future results modern technologies and more important the ones under development are different from those that were important in the past 18 in recent years we have seen growing evidence that not only is the labor share of the economy declining but even among workers some groups are beginning to fall even farther 6 behind 19 over the past forty years the numbers of millionaires and billionaires grew but the average real wages for americans with only a high school education fell 20 while many phenomena contributed to this including new patterns of global trade changes in technology deployment are the single biggest explanation if capital in the form of ai can perform more tasks those with unique assets talents or skills that are not easily replaced with technology stand to benefit disproportionately 21 the result has been greater wealth concentration 22 ultimately a focus on more human like ai can make technology a better substitute for the many non superstar workers driving down their market wages even as it amplifies the market power of a few 23 this has created a growing fear that ai and related advances will lead to a burgeoning class of unemployable or zero marginal product people 24 n unfettered market is likely to create socially excessive incentives for innovations that automate human labor and produce weak incentives for technology that augments humans the first fundamental welfare theorem of economics states that under a particular set of conditions market prices lead to a pareto optimal outcome that is one where no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off but the theorem does not hold when there are innovations that change the production possibilities set or externalities that affect people who are not part of the market both innovations and externalities are of central importance to the economic effects of ai since ai is not only an innovation itself but also one that triggers cascades of complementary innovations from new products to new production systems 25 furthermore the effects of ai particularly on work are rife with externalities when a worker loses opportunities a 7 to earn labor income the costs go beyond the newly unemployed to affect many others in their community and in the broader society with fading opportunities often come the dark horses of alcoholism crime and opioid abuse recently the united states has experienced the first decline in life expectancies in its recorded history a result of increasing deaths from suicide drug overdose and alcoholism what economists anne case and angus deaton call deaths of despair 26 this spiral of marginalization can grow because concentration of economic power often begets concentration of political power in the words attributed to louis brandeis we may have democracy or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few but we can t have both in contrast when humans are indispensable to value creation economic power will tend to be more decentralized historically most economically valuable knowledge what economist simon kuznets called useful knowledge resided within human brains 27 but no human brain can contain even a small fraction of the useful knowledge needed to run even a medium sized business let alone a whole industry or economy so knowledge had to be distributed and decentralized 28 the decentralization of useful knowledge in turn decentralizes economic and political power unlike nonhuman assets such as property and machinery much of a person s knowledge is inalienable both in the practical sense that no one person can know everything that another person knows and in the legal sense that its ownership cannot be legally transferred 29 in contrast when knowledge becomes codified and digitized it can be owned transferred and concentrated very easily thus when knowledge shifts from humans to machines it opens the possibility of concentration of power when historians look back on the first two decades of the twenty first century they will note the striking growth in the digitization and codification of 8 information and knowledge 30 in parallel machine learning models are becoming larger with hundreds of billions of parameters using more data and getting more accurate results 31 more formally incomplete contracts theory shows how ownership of key assets provides bargaining power in relationships between economic agents such as employers and employees or business owners and subcontractors 32 to the extent that a person controls an indispensable asset like useful knowledge needed to create and deliver a company s products and services that person can command not only higher income but also a voice in decision making when useful knowledge is inalienably locked in human brains so too is the power it confers but when it is made alienable it enables greater concentration of decision making and power 33 he risks of the turing trap are amplified because three groups of people technologists businesspeople and policy makers each find it alluring technologists have sought to replicate human intelligence for decades to address the recurring challenge of what computers could not do the invention of computers and the birth of the term electronic brain were the latest fuel for the ongoing battle between technologists and humanist philosophers 34 the philosophers posited a long list of ordinary and lofty human capacities that computers would never be able to do no machine could play checkers master chess read printed words recognize speech translate between human languages distinguish images climb stairs win at jeopardy or go write poems and so forth for professors it is tempting to assign such projects to their graduate students devising challenges that are new useful and achievable can be as difficult as solving them rather than specify a task that neither humans nor machines have ever done before why not ask the research t 9 team to design a machine that replicates an existing human capability unlike more ambitious goals replication has an existence proof that such tasks are in principle feasible and useful while the appeal of human like systems is clear the paradoxical reality is that hlai can be more difficult and less valuable than systems that achieve superhuman performance in 1988 robotics developer hans moravec noted 35 that it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one year old when it comes to perception and mobility but i would argue that in many domains moravec was not nearly ambitious enough it is often comparatively easier for a machine to achieve superhuman performance in new domains than to match ordinary humans in the tasks they do regularly humans have evolved over millions of years to be able to comfort a baby navigate a cluttered forest or pluck the ripest blueberry from a bush tasks that are difficult if not impossible for current machines but machines excel when it comes to seeing x rays etching millions of transistors on a fragment of silicon or scanning billions of webpages to find the most relevant one imagine how feeble and limited our technology would be if past engineers set their sights on merely replicating human levels of perception actuation and cognition augmenting humans with technology opens an endless frontier of new abilities and opportunities the set of tasks that humans and machines can do together is undoubtedly much larger than those humans can do alone figure 1 machines can perceive things that are imperceptible to humans they can act on objects in ways that no human can and they can comprehend things that are incomprehensible to the human brain as demis hassabis ceo of deepmind put it the ai system doesn t play like a human and it doesn t play like a program it plays in a third almost alien way it s like chess from another dimension 36 computer 10 scientist jonathan schaeffer explains the source of its superiority i m absolutely convinced it s because it hasn t learned from humans 37 more fundamentally inventing tools that augment the process of invention itself promises to expand not only our collective abilities but to accelerate the rate of expansion of those abilities figure 1 labor automation and augmentation what about businesspeople they often find that substituting machinery for human labor is the low hanging fruit of innovation the simplest approach is to implement plug and play automation swap in a piece of machinery for each task a human is currently doing that mindset reduces the need for more radical changes to business processes 38 task level automation 11 reduces the need to understand subtle interdependencies and creates easy a b tests by focusing on a known task with easily measurable performance improvement similarly because labor costs are the biggest line item in almost every company s budget automating jobs is a popular strategy for managers cutting costs which can be an internally coordinated effort is often easier than expanding markets moreover many investors prefer scalable business models which is often a synonym for a business that can grow without hiring and the complexities that entails but here again when businesspeople focus on automation they often set out to achieve a task that is both less ambitious and more difficult than it need be to understand the limits of substitution oriented automation consider a thought experiment what if our old friend d dalus had at his disposal an extremely talented team of engineers 3 500 years ago and had somehow built human like machines that fully automated every work related task that his fellow greeks were doing herding sheep automated making clay pottery automated weaving tunics automated repairing horse drawn carts automated bloodletting victims of disease automated the good news is that labor productivity would soar freeing the ancient greeks for a life of leisure the bad news is that their living standards and health outcomes would come nowhere 12 near matching ours after all there is only so much value one can get from clay pots and horse drawn carts even with unlimited quantities and zero prices in contrast most of the value that our economy has created since ancient times comes from new goods and services that not even the kings of ancient empires had not from cheaper versions of existing goods 39 in turn myriad new tasks are required fully 60 percent of people are now employed in occupations that did not exist in 1940 40 in short automating labor ultimately unlocks less value than augmenting it to create something new at the same time automating a whole job is often brutally difficult most jobs involve many tasks that are extremely challenging to automate even with the most clever technologies for example ai may be able to read mammograms better than a human radiologist but it cannot do the other twenty six tasks associated with the job according to o net such as comforting a concerned patient or coordinating on a care plan with other doctors 41 my work with tom mitchell and daniel rock on the suitability for machine learning found many occupations in which machines could contribute some tasks but zero occupations out of 950 in which machine learning could do 100 percent of the necessary tasks 42 the same principle applies to the more complex production systems that involve multiple people working together 43 to be successful firms typically need to adopt a new technology as part of a system of mutually reinforcing organizational changes 44 consider another thought experiment imagine if jeff bezos had automated existing bookstores by simply replacing all the human cashiers with robot cashiers that might have cut costs a bit but the total impact would have been muted instead amazon reinvented the concept of a bookstore by combining humans and machines in a novel way as a result they offer vastly greater product selection ratings reviews and advice and enable 24 7 retail access from the 13 comfort of customers homes the power of the technology was not in automating the work of humans in the existing retail bookstore concept but in reinventing and augmenting how customers find assess purchase and receive books and in turn other retail goods third policy makers have also often tilted the playing field toward automating human labor rather than augmenting it for instance the u s tax code currently encourages capital investment over investment in labor through effective tax rates that are much higher on labor than on plant and equipment 45 consider a third thought experiment two potential ventures each use ai to create one billion dollars of profits if one of them achieves this by augmenting and employing a thousand workers the firm will owe corporate and payroll taxes while the employees will pay income taxes payroll taxes and other taxes if the second business has no employees the government may collect the same corporate taxes but no payroll taxes and no taxes paid by workers as a result the second business model pays far less in total taxes this disparity is amplified because the tax code treats labor income more harshly than capital income in 1986 top tax rates on capital income and labor income were equalized in the united states but since then successive changes have created a large disparity with the 2021 top marginal federal tax rates on labor income of 37 percent while long capital gains have a variety of favorable rules including a lower statutory tax rate of 20 percent the deferral of taxes until capital gains are realized and the step up basis rule that resets capital gains to zero wiping out the associated taxes when assets are inherited the first rule of tax policy is simple you tend to get less of whatever you tax thus a tax code that treats income that uses labor less favorably than income derived from capital will favor automation over augmentation undoing this imbalance would lead to more balanced incentives 14 in fact given the positive externalities of more widely shared prosperity a case could be made for treating wage income more favorably than capital income for instance by expanding the earned income tax credit 46 government policy in other areas could also do more to steer the economy clear of the turing trap the growing use of ai even if only for complementing workers and the further reinvention of organizations around this new general purpose technology implies a great need for worker training or retraining in fact for each dollar spent on machine learning technology companies may need to spend nine dollars on intangible human capital 47 however training suffers from a serious externality issue companies that incur the costs to train or retrain workers may reap only a fraction of the benefits of those investments with the rest potentially going to other companies including competitors as these workers are free to bring their skills to their new employers at the same time workers are often cash and credit constrained limiting their ability to invest in their own skills development 48 this implies that governments policy should directly provide this training or provide incentives for corporate training that offset the externalities created by labor mobility 49 in sum the risks of the turing trap are increased not by just one group in our society but by the misaligned incentives of technologists businesspeople and policy makers he future is not preordained we control the extent to which ai either expands human opportunity through augmentation or replaces humans through automation we can work on challenges that are easy for machines and hard for humans rather than hard for machines and easy for humans the first option offers the opportunity of growing and sharing the economic pie by augmenting the workforce with tools and platforms the second option risks dividing the t 15 economic pie among an ever smaller number of people by creating automation that displaces ever more types of workers while both approaches can and do contribute to progress too many technologists businesspeople and policy makers have been putting a finger on the scales in favor of replacement moreover the tendency of a greater concentration of technological and economic power to beget a greater concentration of political power risks trapping a powerless majority into an unhappy equilibrium the turing trap the backlash against free trade offers a cautionary tale economists have long argued that free trade and globalization tend to grow the economic pie through the power of comparative advantage and specialization they have also acknowledged that market forces alone do not ensure that every person in every country will come out ahead so they proposed a grand bargain maximize free trade to maximize wealth creation and then distribute the benefits broadly to compensate any injured occupations industries and regions it hasn t worked as they had hoped as the economic winners gained power they reneged on the second part of the bargain leaving many workers worse off than before 50 the result helped fuel a populist backlash that led to import tariffs and other barriers to free trade economists wept some of the same dynamics are already underway with ai more and more americans and indeed workers around the world believe that while the technology may be creating a new billionaire class it is not working for them the more technology is used to replace rather than augment labor the worse the disparity may become and the greater the resentments that feed destructive political instincts and actions more fundamentally the moral imperative of treating people as ends and not merely as means calls for everyone to share in the gains of automation 16 the solution is not to slow down technology but rather to eliminate or reverse the excess incentives for automation over augmentation in concert we must build political and economic institutions that are robust in the face of the growing power of ai we can reverse the growing tech backlash by creating the kind of prosperous society that inspires discovery boosts living standards and offers political inclusion for everyone by redirecting our efforts we can avoid the turing trap and create prosperity for the many not just the few author s note the core ideas in this essay were inspired by

this test comes from descartes in the discourse in which he wrote if there were machines which bore a resemblance to our bodies and imitated our actions as closely as possible for all practical purposes we should still have two very certain means of recognizing that they were not real men the first is that they could never use words or put together signs as we do in order to declare our thoughts to others secondly even though some machines might do some things as well as we do them or perhaps even better they would inevitably fail in others which would reveal that they are acting not
