towards decision support in reciprocation gleb polevoy 1 mathijs de weerdt 1 and catholijn jonker 1 1 delft university of technology delft the netherlands september 24 2018 abstract people often interact repeatedly with relatives through file sharing in politics etc many such interactions are reciprocal reacting to the actions of the other in order to facilitate decisions regarding reciprocal interactions we analyze the development of reciprocation over time to this end we propose a model for such interactions that is simple enough to enable formal analysis but is sufficient to predict how such interactions will evolve inspired by existing models of international interactions and arguments between spouses we suggest a model with two reciprocating attitudes where an agent s action is a weighted combination of the others last actions reacting and either i her innate kindness or ii her own last action inertia we analyze a network of repeatedly interacting agents each having one of these attitudes and prove that their actions converge to specific limits convergence means that the interaction stabilizes and the limits indicate the behavior after the stabilization for two agents we describe the interaction process and find the limit values for a general connected network we find these limit values if all the agents employ the second attitude and show that the agents actions then all become equal in the other cases we study the limit values using simulations we discuss how these results predict the development of the interaction and can be used to help agents decide on their behavior keywords reciprocal interaction agents action repeated reciprocation fixed floating behavior network convergence perron frobenius convex com bination 1 introduction interaction is

observers to this end we want to predict interaction instead of being economically rational people tend to adopt other ways of be havior 30 35 not necessarily maximizing some utility function furthermore people tend to reciprocate i e react on the past actions of others 15 17 21 40 since reciprocation is ubiquitous predicting it will allow predicting many real life interactions and advising on how to improve them therefore we need a model for reciprocating agents that is simple enough for analytical analysis and precise enough to predict such interactions understanding such a model would also help understanding how to improve personal and public good this is also important for engineering computer systems that fit human intuition of reciprocity extant models of sometimes repeated reciprocation can be classified as ex plaining existence or analyzing consequences the following models consider the reasons for existence of reciprocal tendencies often incorporating evolutionary arguments the classical works of axelrod 1 2 considered discrete reciprocity and showed that it is rational for egoists so that species evolve to reciprocate evolutionary explanation appears also in other places such as 22 39 or 5 chapter 6 the latter also explicitly considering the psychological aspects of norm emergence in 44 they consider pursuing fairness as a motivation for re ciprocation in 3 and 18 they considered engendering reciprocation by both the genetical kinship theory helping relatives and by the utility from cooper ating when the same pair of agents interact multiple times the famous work of trivers 41 showed that sometimes reciprocity is rational in much biological detail and thus people can evolve to reciprocate gintis 19 chapter 11 con sidered discrete actions discussing not only the rationally evolved tit for tat but also reciprocity with no future interaction in sight what he calls strong reciprocity he modeled the development of strong reciprocity several possible reasons for strong reciprocity such as a social part in the utility of the agents expressing itself in emotions were considered in 16 berg et al 4 proved that people tend to reciprocate and considered possible motivations such as evolutionary stability reciprocal behavior was axiomatically motivated in 37 assuming agents care not only for the outcomes but also for strategies thereby pushed to reciprocate on another research avenue given that reciprocal tendencies exist the fol lowing works analyzed what ways it makes interactions develop some models analyzed reciprocal interactions by defining and analyzing a game where the utility function of rational agents directly depends on showing reciprocation such as in 11 14 15 29 the importance of reward punishment or of incom plete contracts for the flourishing of reciprocal individuals in the society was shown in 17 to summarize reciprocity is seen as an inborn quality 16 41 which has probably been evolved from rationality of agents as was shown by axelrod 1 as we have already said understanding how a reciprocal interaction between agents with various reciprocal inclinations uncurls with time will help explain and predict the dynamics of reciprocal interaction such as arms races and per 2 sonal relations this would also be in the spirit of the call to consider various repercussions of reciprocity from 27 since no analysis considers non discrete lengthy interaction caused by inborn reciprocation unlike say the discrete one from axelrod 1 2 we model and study how reciprocity makes interaction evolve with time we represent actions by weight where a bigger value means a more desirable contribution or in the interpersonal context investment in the relationship we model reciprocity by two reciprocation attitudes an action s weight being a convex combination between i one s own kindness or ii one s own last action and the other s and neighborhood s last actions the whole past should be considered but we assume that the last actions represent the history enough to facilitate analysis defining an action or how much it changes or a state by a linear combination of the other side s actions and own actions and qualities was also used to analyze arms race 13 45 and spouses interaction 20 piecewise linear in this case attitude i depending on the fixed kindness is called fixed and ii depending on one s own last action is called floating given this model we study its behavioral repercussions there are several reminiscent but different models the floating model re sembles opinions that converge to a consensus 7 26 42 12 while the fixed model resembles converging to a general equilibrium of opinions 6 of course unlike the models of spreading opinions we consider different actions on various neighbors determined by direct reaction and a reaction to the whole neighbor hood still because of some technical reminiscence to some of our models we do use those for one of our proofs another similar model is that of monotonic concession 33 and that of bargaining over dividing a pie 34 the main differ ence is that in those models the agents decide what to do while in our case they follow the reciprocation formula example 1 consider n colleagues 1 2 n who can help or harm each other let the possible actions be giving bad work showing much contempt showing little contempt supporting emotionally a little supporting emotionally a lot advising and let their respective weight be a point in 1 0 5 0 5 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 4 0 7 0 7 1 assume that each person knows what the other did to him last time the social climate meaning what the whole group did also influences behavior however we may just concentrate on a single pair of even tempered colleagues who reciprocate regardless the others to understand and predict reciprocal behavior we look at the limit of time approaching infinity since this describes what actions will take place from some time on we first consider two agents in section 3 assuming their interaction is independent of other agents or that the total influence of the others on the pair is negligible this assumption allows for deeper a theoretical analysis of the interaction than in the general case the values in the limit for two agents will be also implied by a general convergence result that is presented later unless both agents are fixed we still present them with the other results for two agents for the completeness of section 3 section 5 studies interaction of many agents where the techniques we used for two agents are not applicable and we 3 show exponentially fast convergence exponential convergence means a rapid stabilizing and it explains acquiring personal behavioral styles which is often seen in practice 32 we find the limit when all the agents act synchronously and at most one has the fixed reciprocation attitude among other things we prove that when at most one agent is fixed the limits of the actions of all agents are the same explaining formation of organizational subcultures known in the literature 24 we also find that only the kindness values of the fixed agents influence the limits of the various actions thereby explaining that persistence i e being faithful to one s inner inclination makes interaction go one s own way which is reflected in daily life in the recommendations to reject undesired requests by firmly repeating the reasons for rejection 8 chapter 1 and 43 chapter 8 other cases are simulated in section 6 these results describe the interaction process and lay the foundation for further analysis of interaction the major contributions are proving convergence and finding its limits for at most one fixed agent or for two agents these allow to explain the above mentioned phenomena and predict reciprocation the predictions can assist in deciding whether a given interaction will be profitable and in engineering more efficient multi agent systems fitting the reciprocal intuition of the users 2 modeling reciprocation 2 1 basic let n 1 2 n be n 2 interacting agents we assume that possible actions are described by an undirected interaction graph g n e such that agent i acts on j and vice versa if and only if i j e denote the degree of agent i n in g by d i this allows for various topologies including heterogeneous ones like those in 36 to be able to mention directed edges we shall treat this graph as a directed one where for every i j e we have j i e time is modeled by a set of discrete moments t t 0 1 2 defining a time slot whenever at least one agent acts agent i acts at times ti ti 0 0 ti 1 ti 2 t and i nti t we assume that all agents act at t 0 since otherwise we cannot sometimes consider the last action of another agent which would force us to complicate the model and render it even harder for theoretical analysis when all agents always act at the same times t 1 t 2 tn t we say they act synchronously for the sake of asymptotic analysis we assume that each agent gets to act an infinite number of times that is ti is infinite for every i n any real application will of course realize only a finite part of it and infinity models the unboundedness of the process in time when i j is in e we denote the weight of an action by agent i n on another agent j n at moment t by acti j t ti r we extend acti j to t by assuming that at t t ti we have acti j t 0 since only the weight of an action is relevant we usually write action while referring to its weight for example when interacting by file sharing sending a valid piece of a file nothing 4 or a piece with a virus has a positive zero or a negative weight respectively for t t we define the last action time si t t ti of agent i as the largest t ti that is at most t since 0 ti this is well defined the last action of agent i on another agent j is given by xi j t acti j si t thus we have defined xi j t t r and we use mainly this concept xi j in the paper we denote the total received contribution from all the neighbors n i at their last action times not later than t by goti t t r formally goti t j n i xj i t we now define two reciprocation attitudes which define how an agent re ciprocates we need the following notions the kindness of agent i is denoted by ki r w l o g kn k 2 k 1 throughout the paper kindness models inherent inclination to help others in particular it determines the first action of an agent before others have acted we model agent i s inclination to mimic a neighboring agent s action and the actions of the whole neighborhood in g by reciprocation coefficients ri 0 1 and r i 0 1 respectively such that ri r i 1 here ri is the fraction of xi j t that is determined by the last action of j upon i and r i is the fraction that is determined by 1 n i th of the total contribution to i from all the neighbors at the last time 2 2 reciprocation intuitively the fixed attitude depends on the agent s kindness at every action while the floating one is loose moving freely in the reciprocation process and kindness directly influences such behavior only at t 0 in both cases xi j 0 ki definition 1 for the fixed reciprocation attitude agent i s reaction on the other agent j and on the neighborhood is determined by the agent s kindness weighted by 1 ri r i by the other agent s action weighted by ri and by the total action of the neighbors weighted by r i and divided over all the neighbors that is for t ti acti j t xi j t 1 ri r i ki ri xj i t 1 r i goti t 1 n i definition 2 in the floating reciprocation attitude agent i s action is a weighted average of her own last action of that of the other agent j and of the total action of the neighbors divided over all the neighbors to be precise for t ti acti j t xi j t 1 ri r i xi j t 1 ri xj i t 1 r i goti t 1 n i the relations are usually inhomogeneous linear recurrences with constant coefficients we could express the dependence xi j t only on xi j t with t t but then the coefficients would not be constant besides the case of two fixed agents we are not aware of a method to use the general recurrence theory to improve our results 5 2 3 clarifications compared to the other models our model takes reciprocal actions as given and looks at the process while other models either consider how reciprocation originates such as the evolutionary model of axelrod 1 or take it as given and consider specific games such as in 11 14 15 29 in example 1 let just here n 3 and the reciprocation coefficients be r 1 r 2 0 5 r 1 r 2 0 3 r 3 0 8 r 3 0 1 assume the kindness to be k 1 0 k 2 0 5 and k 3 1 since this is a small group all the colleagues may interact so the graph is a clique 1 at t 0 every agent s action on every other agent is equal to her kindness value so agent 1 does nothing agent 2 supports emotionally a lot and 3 provides advice if all agents act synchronously meaning t 1 t 2 t 3 0 1 and all get carried away by the process meaning that they forget the kindness in the sense of employing floating reciprocation then at t 1 they act as follows x 1 2 1 1 0 5 0 3 0 0 5 0 5 0 3 0 5 12 0 475 supports emotionally a lot x 1 3 1 1 0 5 0 3 0 0 5 1 0 3 0 5 12 0 975 provides advice x 2 1 1 1 0 5 0 3 0 5 0 5 0 0 3 0 12 0 25 supports emotionally a little and so on consider modeling tit for tat 2 example 2 in our model the tit for tat with two options cooperate or defect is easily modeled with ri 1 ki 1 meaning that the original action is cooperating 1 and the next action is the current action of the other player since we consider a mechanism rather than a game the agents will always cooperate if one agent begins with cooperation k 1 1 and the other one with defection k 2 0 acting synchronously then they will alternate the notation is summarized in table 1 3 pairwise interaction we now consider an interaction of two agents 1 and 2 since this assumption allows proving much more than we will be able to in the general case the model reduces to a pairwise interaction when r i 0 or when there are no neighbors besides the other agent in the considered pair we assume both w l o g since agent 1 can only act on agent 2 and vice versa we write acti t for acti j t x t for x 1 2 t and y t for x 2 1 t we analyze the case of both agents being fixed then the case of the floating and then the case where one is fixed and the other one is floating to formally discuss the actions after the interaction has stabilized we consider the limits if exist 2 limp act 1 t 1 p and limt x t for agent 1 and limp act 2 t 2 p and limt y t for agent 2 since the sequence x t is act 1 t 1 p with finite repetitions the limit limt x t exists if and only if limp act 1 t 1 p does if 1 a clique is a fully connected graph 2 agent i acts at the times in ti ti 0 0 ti 1 ti 2 6 term meaning acti j t t r the action of i on another agent j at time t ti the time moments when agent i acts synchronous t 1 t 2 tn si t t ti max t ti t t xi j t t r acti j si t goti t t r j n i xj i t ki the

notation used throughout the paper they exist they are equal the same holds for limt y t and limp act 2 t 2 p denote lx limt x t and ly limt y t 3 1 fixed reciprocation here we prove that both action sequences converge theorem 1 if the reciprocation coefficients are not both 1 which means r 1 r 2 1 then we have for i n limp acti ti p 1 ri ki ri 1 rj kj 1 rirj the assumption that not both reciprocation coefficients are 1 and the similar assumptions in the following theorems such as 1 ri 0 mean that the agent neither ignores the other s action nor does it copy the other s action these are to be expected in real life in example 1 if agents 1 and 2 employ fixed 7 reciprocation r 1 r 2 0 5 r 1 r 2 0 0 and k 1 0 k 2 0 5 then we obtain lx 0 5 1 0 5 0 5 1 0 5 0 5 1 6 and ly 1 0 5 0 5 1 0 5 0 5 1 3 in order to prove this theorem we first show that it is sufficient to analyze the synchronous case i e t 1 t 2 t lemma 1 consider a pair of interacting agents denote the action se quences in case both agents acted at the same time i e t 1 t 2 t by x t t t and y t t t respectively then the action sequences 3 act 1 t 1 p p n act 2 t 2 p p n are subsequences of x t t t and y t t t respectively the proof follows from definition 1 by induction straightforward proofs in this paper have been replaced by their general ideas due to lack of space using this lemma it is sufficient to further assume the synchronous case lemma 2 in the synchronous case for every t 0 x 2 t 1 x 2 t 1 and for every t 0 x 2 t x 2 t 2 x 2 t 1 by analogy t 0 y 2 t 1 y 2 t 1 and t 0 y 2 t y 2 t 2 y 2 t 1 all the inequations are strict if and only if 0 r 1 r 2 1 k 2 k 1 4 since we also have t 0 x 2 t x 2 t 1 we obtain t 0 x 2 t 1 x 2 t 1 x 2 t and for every t 0 x 2 t x 2 t 2 x 2 t 1 by analogy t 0 y 2 t 1 y 2 t 1 y 2 t and t 0 y 2 t y 2 t 2 y 2 t 1 intuitively this means that the sequence x t is alternating while its amplitude is getting smaller and the same holds for the sequence y t with another alternation direction the intuitive reasons are that first agent 1 increases her action while 2 decreases it then since 2 has decreased her action so does 1 while since 1 has increased hers so does 2 we now prove the lemma proof we employ induction for t 0 we need to show that x 0 x 2 x 1 and y 0 y 2 y 1 we know that x 0 k 1 x 1 1 r 1 k 1 r 1 k 2 and y 0 k 2 y 1 1 r 2 k 2 r 2 k 1 since y 1 k 2 we have x 2 1 r 1 k 1 r 1 y 1 x 1 since y 1 k 1 we also have x 2 1 r 1 k 1 r 1 y 1 x 0 the proof for ys is analogous for the induction step for any t 0 assume that the lemma holds for t 1 which means x 2 t 3 x 2 t 1 for t 1 x 2 t 2 x 2 t x 2 t 1 and y 2 t 3 y 2 t 1 for t 1 y 2 t 2 y 2 t y 2 t 1 we now prove the lemma for t by definition 1 x 2 t 1 1 r 1 k 1 r 1 y 2 t 2 and x 2 t 1 1 r 1 k 1 r 1 y 2 t since y 2 t 2 y 2 t we have x 2 t 1 x 2 t 1 by analogy we can prove that y 2 t 1 y 2 t 1 also by definition x 2 t 1 r 1 k 1 r 1 y 2 t 1 and x 2 t 2 1 r 1 k 1 r 1 y 2 t 1 since y 2 t 1 y 2 t 1 we have x 2 t x 2 t 2 by definition x 2 t 1 1 r 1 k 1 r 1 y 2 t since y 2 t y 2 t 1 we conclude that x 2 t 1 x 2 t by analogy we prove that y 2 t 1 y 2 t from 3 agent i acts at the times in ti ti 0 0 ti 1 ti 2 4 we always assume that k 2 k 1 8 this we conclude that x 2 t 2 x 2 t 1 and we have shown that x 2 t x 2 t 2 x 2 t 1 by analogy we prove that y 2 t y 2 t 2 y 2 t 1 the equivalence of strictness in all the inequations to 0 r 1 r 2 1 k 2 k 1 is proven by repeating the proof with strict inequalities in one direction and by noticing that not having one of the conditions 0 r 1 r 2 1 k 2 k 1 implies equality in at least one of the statements of the lemma with these results we now prove theorem 1 proof using lemma 1 we assume the synchronous case we first prove conver gence and then find its limit for each agent lemma 2 implies that the even actions form a monotone sequence and so do the odd ones both sequences are bounded which can be easily proven by induction and therefore each one converges the whole sequence converges if and only if both limits are the same we now show that they are indeed the same for the sequence x t the proof for y t is analogous x t 1 x t 1 r 1 k 1 r 1 y t 1 r 1 k 1 r 1 y t 1 r 1 y t y t 1 r 1 r 2 x t 1 x t 2 r 1 r 2 bt 2 c x 1 x 0 t 2 s s n x 2 x 1 t 2 s 1 s n as r 1 r 2 1 this difference goes to 0 as t goes to thus x t converges and so does y t to find the lim its lx limt x t and ly limt y t notice that in the limit we have 1 r 1 k 1 r 1 ly lx and 1 r 2 k 2 r 2 lx ly with the unique solution lx 1 r 1 k 1 r 1 1 r 2 k 2 1 r 1 r 2 and ly 1 r 2 k 2 r 2 1 r 1 k 1 1 r 1 r 2 we see that lx ly which is intuitive since the agents are always con sidering their kindness so the kinder one acts with a bigger weight also in the limit in the simulation of the actions over time in figure 1 on the left y t is always larger than x t and on the right they alternate several times before y t becomes larger 3 2 floating reciprocation if both agents have the floating reciprocation attitude their action sequences converge to a common limit theorem 2 if 0 r 1 r 2 2 then as t x t and y t converge to the same limit in the synchronous case t 1 t 2 t they both approach 1 2 k 1 k 2 k 2 k 1 r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 r 2 r 1 r 2 k 1 r 1 r 1 r 2 k 2 the common limit of the actions is shown in figure 2 in example 1 if agents 1 and 2 employ fixed reciprocation r 1 r 2 0 5 r 1 r 2 0 0 and k 1 0 k 2 0 5 then we obtain lx ly 1 2 0 1 2 0 5 0 25 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 1 9 2 time w e ig h t o f a c ti o n s agent 1 agent 2 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4

receives most when r 1 1 and given r 1 agent 2 receives most when r 2 0 the idea of the proof is to show that min x t y t max x t y t t 1 is a nested sequence of segments which lengths approach zero and therefore x t and y t converge to the same limit finding this limit stems from finding limt x t y t 3 3 fixed and floating reciprocation assume that agent 1 employs the fixed reciprocation attitude while 2 acts by the floating reciprocation we can show theorem 3 using the following lemma lemma 3 if r 2 0 and r 1 r 2 1 then for every t t 1 1 x t 1 x t and for every t 0 y t 1 y t the proof is by induction on t using the definitions of reciprocation with this lemma we can prove the following theorem 3 if r 2 0 and r 1 r 2 1 then limt x y limt y t k 1 proof we first prove that the convergence takes place and then find its limit for each agent lemma 3 implies that her actions are monotonically non increasing since the actions are bounded below by k 1 which can be easily proven by induction they both converge to find the limits notice that in the limit we have 1 r 1 k 1 r 1 ly lx 1 1 r 2 ly r 2 lx ly 2 from eq 2 we conclude that lx ly since r 2 0 substituting this to eq 1 gives us lx ly k 1 since r 2 0 and r 1 r 2 1 imply r 1 1 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 1 9 2 time w e ig h t o f a c ti o n s agent 1 agent 2 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1

is a fixed floating reciprocation with k 1 1 k 2 2 r 1 0 3 in the left graph agent 1 s actions are smaller than those of 2 agent 1 s actions decrease after t 1 while those of agent 2 decrease all the time the common limits value fits the theorem s prediction the relation between the sequences of xs and ys is given by the following proposition also covering the case r 1 r 2 1 proposition 1 if r 1 r 2 1 then for every t 0 y t x t if r 1 r 2 1 then y 0 x 0 for every t 0 such that t t 1 t 2 we have y t 1 x t 1 y t x t for any t t 1 t 2 we have y t x t and for any t t 2 t 1 we have y t 1 x t 1 y t x t and y t 1 x t 1 y t x t the proof employs induction on t we note that although we have not seen yet whether theorem 3 holds for r 1 r 2 1 we know that neither monotonicity lemma 3 nor y t being always at least as large as x t or the other way around holds in this case as a counterexample for both of them consider the case of r 2 1 0 r 1 1 k 2 k 1 one can readily prove by induction that for all t we have x 2 t 1 x 2 t x 2 t 2 and y 2 t y 2 t 1 y 2 t 1 and thus both sequences are not monotonic in addition one can inductively prove that x 2 t 1 y 2 t 1 x 2 t y 2 t and therefore no sequence is always larger than the other one figure 3 shows how the actions evolve over time the actions seem to con verge also in the unproven case r 1 r 2 1 in the case of the mirroring assumption that agent 1 acts according to the floating reciprocation attitude while 2 acts according to the fixed reciprocation we can obtain similar results which are omitted due to lack of space for all the considered cases we have the following proposition 2 if both lx and ly exist then lx ly 11 4 alternating case we consider the interaction of two agents 1 and 2 some of the statements in the paper refer only to the synchronous case t 1 t 2 t all of them can be updated for the alternating case t 1 contains precisely all the even times and t 2 contains zero and all the odd ones theorem 2 can be extended as follows theorem 4 in the case where agents act alternately which is when t 1 contains precisely all the even times and t 2 contains zero and all the odd ones they both approach 1 2 k 1 k 2 r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 k 2 k 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 k 1 r 1 r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 k 2 the idea of the proof is proving that x t y t approach k 1 k 2 r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 k 2 k 1 5 multi agent interaction we now analyze the general interdependent interaction when agents inter act with many agents to formally discuss the actions after the interaction has settled down we consider the limits if exist 5 limp acti j t 1 p and limt xi j t for agents i and j since the sequence xi j t is acti j t 1 p with finite repetitions the limit limp acti j t 1 p exists if and only if limt xi j t does if they exist they are equal denote li j limt xi j t we first provide general convergence results and then we find the common limit for the case when at most one agent is fixed and synchronous in theorem 6 we finally use simulations to analyze the limits in other cases in this section the ambivalent case of ri r i 1 is taken to be floating first we have convergence for the case of floating agents proposition 3 consider a connected interaction graph where all agents are floating and for every agent i ri r i 1 then for all pairs of agents i 6 j such that i j e the limit li j exists all these limits are equal to each other proof follows directly from 7 theorem 2 this article and similar articles on multiagent coordination 26 42 prove convergence when all agents are floating we now show convergence when some agents are fixed 5 agent i acts at the times in ti ti 0 0 ti 1 ti 2 12 proposition 4 consider a connected interaction graph where for all agents i r i 0 assume that at least one agent employs the fixed attitude and every agent acts at least once every q times for a natural q 0 then for all pairs of agents i 6 j such that i j e the limit li j exists the convergence is geometrically fast proof we express how each action depends on the actions in the previous time in matrix a t r e e which in the synchronous case is defined as follows a t i j k l 1 ri r i if k i l j ri r i 1 n i if k j l i r i 1 n i if k 6 j l i 0 otherwise 3 where the first line is missing for the fixed agents since for them own behavior does not matter if for each time t t the column vector p t r e describes the actions at time t in the sense that its i j th coordinate contains xi j t for i j e then we have p t 1 a t 1 p t k where k is the relevant kindness vector formally defined as k t i j 1 ri r i ki if i is fixed 0 otherwise in a not necessarily synchronous case only a subset of agents act at a given time t for an acting agent i every a t i j k l is defined as in the syn chronous case for a non acting agent i we define a t i j k l 1 if k i l j 0 otherwise 4 the kindness vector is defined as k t i j 1 ri r i ki if i is fixed and acting 0 otherwise by induction we obtain p t t t 1 a t p 0 k k l s k t t t la t k where k is the set of all possible kindness vectors and s k t is a set of the appearance times of k which are at most t we aim to show that p t converges first defining ri m to be the sum of the ith row of m note 9 eq 3 namely ri ab n j 1 n k 1 ai jbj k n j 1 ai jrj b 5 13 since the sum of every row in any a t is at most 1 we conclude that if b c ci j 1 then also a t b c we now prove that an upper bound of the form c on the entries of q t pa t converges to zero geometrically we have just shown that this bound never increases first a p c yielding the bound in the beginning now let i be a fixed agent and assume he acts at time t thus each row in a t which relates to the edges entering i sums to less than 1 and from eq 5 we gather that the upper bound on the appropriate rows in a t b decreases rela tively to the bound on b by some constant ratio since the graph is connected for all agents i r i 0 and every agent acts every q times we will have after enough multiplications that the bound on all the entries will have decreased by a constant ratio every agent acts at least once every q times so we gather that for some q 0 every q times the product of matrices becomes at most a given frac tion of the product q times before this implies a geometric convergence of t t 1 a t as for l s k t t t la t we have proven an exponential upper bound thus l s k t t t la t l s k t t l 1 q c l s k t t l q c t q l s k t l q c geom seq t q 1 1 q 1 c proving a geometric convergence of the series l s k t t t la t therefore p t converges and it does so geo metrically fast as an immediate conclusion of this proposition we can finally generalize theorem 3 to the case r 1 r 2 1 as follows corollary 5 consider pairwise interaction where one agent i employs fixed reciprocation and the other agent j employs the floating one and every agent acts at least once every q times assume that 0 ri 1 and rj 0 then both limits exist and are equal to ki the convergence is geometrically fast proof proposition 4 implies geometrically fast convergence we find the limits as in the proof of theorem 3 we now turn to finding the limit we manage to do this only in the syn chronous case when all the agents are floating or all the fixed agents have the same kindness for all reciprocation attitudes the following theorem also provides an alternative proof of convergence in the synchronous case theorem 6 given a connected interaction graph consider the synchronous case where for all agents i r i 0 if there exists a cycle of an odd length in the graph or at least one agent i employs floating reciprocation and has ri r i 1 then for all pairs of agents i 6 j such that i j e the limit li j exists and it is a positive combination of all the kindness values of the agents who are fixed if at least one agent is fixed and of all the kindness values k 1 kn if all agents are floating the convergence is geometrically fast moreover if 14 all agents employ floating reciprocation then all these limits are equal to each other and it is a convex combination of the kindness values namely l i n d i ri r i ki i n d i ri r i 6 if on the other hand all the fixed agents have the same kindness k then all these limits are equal to k in any case when not all the agents are floating then changing only the kindness of the floating agents leaves all the limits as before also follows from the limits being positive combinations of all the kindness values of the agents who are fixed let us say several words about the assumptions if all agents are fixed we can prove that the actions are subsequences of the actions in the synchronous case a straightforward generalization of lemma 1 thus the synchronous case represents all the cases in the limit when all agents are fixed the assumption of a cycle of an odd length virtually always holds since three people influencing each other form such a cycle proof we first prove the case where all agents use floating reciprocation we express how each action depends on the actions in the previous time in a matrix and prove the theorem by applying the famous perron frobenius theorem 38 theorem 1 1 1 2 to this matrix we now define the dynamics matrix a r e e a i j k l 1 ri r i if k i l j ri r i 1 n i if k j l i r i 1 n i if k 6 j l i 0 otherwise 7 according to the definition of floating reciprocation if for each time t t the column vector p t r e describes the actions at time t in the sense that its i j th coordinate contains xi j t for i j e then p t 1 a p t we then call p t an action vector initially p i j 0 ki further we shall need to use the perron frobenius theorem for primitive matrices we now prepare to use it and first we show that a is primitive first a is irreducible since we can move from any i j e to any k l e as follows we can move from an action to its reverse since if k j l i then a i j k l ri r i 1 n i 0 we can also move from an action to another action by the same agent since we can move to any action on the same agent and then to its reverse to move to an action on the same agent notice that if l i then a i j k l r i 1 n i 0 now we can move from any action i j to any other action k l by moving to the reverse action j i if k j l i we are done then follow a path from j to k in graph g by moving to the appropriate action by an agent and then to the reverse as many 15 times as needed till we are at the action k j and finally to the action k l thus a is irreducible by definition a is non negative a is aperiodic since either at least one agent i has ri ri 1 and thus the diagonal contains non zero elements or there exists a cycle of an odd length in the interaction graph g in the latter case let the cycle be i 1 i 2 ip for an odd p consider the follow ing cycles on the index set of the matrix i j j i i j for any i j e and i 2 i 1 i 3 i 2 ip ip 1 i 1 ip i 2 i 1 their lengths are 2 and p re spectively which greatest common divisor is 1 implying aperiodicity being irreducible and aperiodic a is primitive by 38 theorem 1 4 since the sum of every row is 1 the spectral radius is 1 according to the perron frobenius theorem for primitive matrices 38 the orem 1 1 the absolute values of all eigenvalues except one eigenvalue of 1 are strictly less than 1 the eigenvalue 1 has unique right and left eigenvectors up to a constant factor both these eigenvectors are strictly positive there fore 38 theorem 1 2 implies that limt a t 1 v where v is the left eigen vector of the value 1 normalized such that v 1 1 and the approach rate is geometric therefore we obtain limt p t limt a t p 0 1 v p 0 1 i j e v i j ki thus actions converge to 1 times i j e v i j ki to find this limit consider the vector v defined by v i j 1 ri r i sub stitution shows it is a left eigenvector of a to normalize it such that v 1 1 divide this vector by the sum of its coordinates which is i n d i ri r i obtaining v i j 1 i n d i ri r i 1 ri r i therefore the common limit is i n d i ri r i ki i n d i ri r i we now prove the case where at least one agent employs fixed reciprocation we define the dynamics matrix a analogously to the previous case besides that the first line from eq 7 is missing for the fixed agents since for them own behavior does not matter in this case we have p t 1 a p t k where k is the relevant kindness vector formally defined as k i j 1 ri r i ki if i is fixed 0 otherwise by induction we obtain p t at p 0 t 1 l 0 a l k analogically to the previous case a is irreducible and non negative as shown above a is aperiodic and therefore primitive since at least one agent employs fixed reciprocation at least one row of a sums to less than 1 and therefore the spectral radius of a is strictly less than 1 now the perron frobenius implies that all the eigenvalues are strictly smaller than 1 since we have limt p t limt a t p 0 limt t 1 l 0 a l k 38 theorem 1 2 implies that this limits exist the first part converges to zero while the second one is a series of geometrically decreasing elements since a is primitive limt t 1 l 0 a l 0 16 when all the fixed agents have the same kindness k we now find the limits taking the limits in the equality p t 1 a p t k yields i a limt p t k 38 lemma b 1 implies that i a is invertible and therefore if we guess a vector x that fulfills i a x k it will be the limit since the vector with all actions equal to k satisfies this equation we conclude that all the limits are equal to k in any case when there exists at least one fixed agent changing only the kindness of the floating agents will not change the unique solution of i a x k and therefore will not change the limits let us consider several examples of eq 6 example 3 if the interaction graph is regular meaning that all the degrees are equal to each other we have l i n ki ri r i i n 1 ri r i this holds for cliques modeling small human collectives or groups of countries and for cycles modeling circular computer networks example 4 for star networks modeling networks of a supervisor of several people or entities assume w l o g that agent 1 is the center and we have l n 1 r 1 r 1 k 1 i n 1 ki ri r i n 1 r 1 r 1 i n 1 1 ri r i an obvious conclusion of the theorem is that the fixed agents are intuitively spoken more important than the floating ones at least their kindness is we now conclude about the optimal reciprocation which goes back to providing decision support proposition 5 if eq 6 holds then agent i who wants to maximize the com mon value l and who can choose either ri or r i in certain limits a b for a 0 should choose either the smallest possible or the largest possible coef ficient as follows we assume we choose ri but the same holds for r i with the obvious adjustments she should set ri to b if j n i d j rj r j kj ki j n i d j rj r j is positive to a if that is negative and to an arbitrary if zero when this expression is not zero only these choices are optimal the proof considers the sign of the derivative and is omitted due to lack of space 6 simulations we now answer some theoretically unanswered questions from section 5 us ing matlab simulations running at least 100 synchronous rounds to achieve practical convergence we first concentrate on the case of three agents who can influence each other meaning that the interaction graph is a clique we begin by corroborating the 17 already proven result that when at least one fixed agents exists then the kind ness of the floating agents does not influence the actions in the limit another proven thing we corroborate is that when exactly one fixed agent exists then all the actions approach her kindness as time approaches infinity when the actions are plotted as functions of time we obtain graphs such as those in figure 4 the left graph on that figure demonstrates that exponential convergence may be quite slow and this is a new observation we did not know from the theory we also corroborate that the limiting values of the actions depend linearly on the kindness values of all the fixed agents the proportionality coefficients being independent of the other kindness values in order to reasonably cover the sam pling space all the above mentioned regularities have also been automatically checked for the combinations of kindness values of 1 2 3 4 5 over ri and r i values of 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 and over all the relevant reciprocation attitudes the checks were up to the absolute precision of 0 01 we do not know the exact limits when there exist two or more fixed agents with distinct kindness values we at least know that the dependencies on the kindness values are linear but we lack theoretical knowledge about the depen dencies of the limits of actions on the reciprocation coefficients so we simulate the interaction for various reciprocation coefficients obtaining graphs like those in figure 5 and analogously for the dependency on r 1 note that we can have both increasing and decreasing graphs in the same scenario and also convex and concave graphs the observed monotonicity was automatically verified for all the above mentioned combinations of parameters this monotonicity means that if an agent wants to maximize the limit of the actions of some agent on some other agent she can do this by choosing an extreme value of ri or r i the next thing we study is a fourth agent interacting with some of the other agents we consider the limits of the actions as functions of the fourth agent s degree but we found no regularity in these graphs in particular no monotonicity holds

is the only floating agent all the graphs exhibit monotonicity 7 additional notes when defining a reciprocating reaction we used the last action of the other agent to model the opinion about the other agent we can explicitly define the opinion of agent i about another agent j at time t opini j r t 1 r as opini j t actj i sj t upon i then we obtain that in the fixed reciprocation attitude for t 0 acti j t 1 ri r i ki ri opini j t 1 r i goti t 1 n i and in the floating reciprocation attitude for t 0 acti j t 1 ri r i acti j si t 1 ri opini j t 1 r i goti t 1 n i naturally a more general definition of opinion is possible to this end we define the temporal distance in ti for an i n which designates how many times agent i acted between two given times in ti formally for an i n and two times ti l ti m ti we define dti t 2 i r by dti ti l ti m l m now define the cumulative opinion of i about j at time t to be opini j t t tj t t i dtj t sj t 1 actj i t where i p r r is the dis count function expressing how much the passed time influences the importance of an action our definition of opinion as opini j t actj i sj t is a particular case of this model where the discount function is i p 1 p 1 0 otherwise 8 related work in addition to the direct motivation for our model presented in section 1 we were inspired by trivers 41 a psychologist who describes a balance between 19 an inner quality immutable kindness and costs benefits when determining an action this idea of balancing the inner and the outer appears also in our model the idea of humans behaving according to a convex combination resembles another model that of the altruistic extension like 10 23 31 and chapter iii 2 in 25 in these papers utility is often assumed being a convex combination while we consider a mechanism of an action being a convex combination 9 conclusions and future work in order to facilitate behavioral decisions regarding reciprocation we need to predict what interaction a given setting will engender to this end we model two reciprocation attitudes where a reaction is a weighted combination of the action of the other player the total action of the neighborhood and either one s own kindness or one s own last action for a pairwise interaction we show that actions converge find the exact limits and show that if you consider your kindness while reciprocating fixed then asymptotically your actions values get closer to your kindness than if you consider it only at the outset for a general network we prove convergence and find the common limit if all agents act synchronously and consider their last own action floating besides at most one agent dealing with the case when multiple agents consider their kindness fixed is mathematically hard so we use simulations in example 1 with the parameters from the end of section 2 all the agents employ floating reciprocation eq 6 implies that all the actions ap proach 25 52 in the limit meaning that all the colleagues support each other emotionally a lot in addition to predicting the development of reciprocal interactions our re sults explain why persistent agents have more influence on the interaction an expression of the converged behavior is that while growing up people acquire their own style of reciprocating with acquaintances 32 in organizations many styles are often very similar from person to person forming organizational cul tures 24 we saw in theory and we know from everyday life that the reciprocation process may seem confusing but the exponential convergence promises the con fusion to be short actually we can have a not so quick exponential convergence such as observed in the left graph in figure 4 but mostly the process converges quickly another important conclusion is that employing floating reciprocation makes us achieve equality in the synchronous case to achieve a common limit it is also enough for all the fixed agents to have the same kindness we also show that if all agents employ floating reciprocation and act synchronously then the influence of an agent is proportional to her number of neighbors and inversely proportional to her tendency to reciprocate that is the stability we prove that in the synchronous case the limit is either a linear combination of the kindnesses of all the fixed agents or if all the agents are floating a linear combination of the kindnesses of all the agents thus an agent s kindness influences nothing 20 or it is a linear factor thereby enabling a very eager agent to influence the limits arbitrarily by having the fixed attitude and the appropriate kindness as we see in examples real situations may require more complex modeling motivating further research for instance modeling interactions with a known finite time horizon would be interesting since people may change while recip rocating modeling changes in the reciprocity coefficients and or reciprocation attitude is important in addition groups of colleagues and nations get and lose people motivating modeling a dynamically changing set of reciprocating agents even with the same set of agents the interaction graph may change as people move around we study interaction processes where agents recipro cate with some given parameters and show that maximizing l would require extreme values of reciprocation coefficients to predict real situations better and to be able to give constructive advice about what parameters and attitudes of the agents are useful we should define utility functions to the agents and consider the game where agents choose their own parameters before the inter action commences this is hard but people are able to change their behavior considering how to influence agents to change their behavior is also relevant though it seems extremely hard it would be nice to consider our model in the light of a game theoretic model of an extensive form game such as 14 we used others research based on real data as a basis for the model actually evaluating the model on relevant data like the arms race actions may be enlightening an agent could have different kindness values towards different agents to represent her prejudgement another extension would be allowing the same action be perceived differently by various agents a system of agents who have both a fixed and a floating component would be interesting to analyze analytical and simulations analysis of reciprocation process allows estimat ing whether an interaction will be profitable to a given agent and lays the foun dation for further modeling and analysis of reciprocation in order to anticipate and improve the individual utilities and the social welfare acknowledgments this work has been supported by the project shine the flagship project of di rect delft
