action voluntary vaccination and other prospective choices stand as paramount examples of this setting 1 4 in this context as well as in many other social dilemmas uncertainty may produce non trivial effects 5 whereas uncertainty about collective targets and their impact were shown to negatively affect group coordination and success 6 8 no information is available about timing uncertainty i e how uncertainty about when the target needs to be reached affects the outcome as well as the decision making here we show experimentally through a collective dilemma wherein groups of participants need to avoid a tipping point under the risk of collective loss 8 that timing uncertainty prompts not only early generosity 9 but also polarized contributions in which participants total contributions are distributed more unfairly than when there is no uncertainty analyzing participant behavior reveals under uncertainty an increase in reciprocal strategies wherein contributions are conditional on the previous donations of the other participants a group analogue of the well known tit for tat 10 11 strategy although large timing uncertainty appears to reduce collective success groups that successfully collect the required amount show strong reciprocal coordination this conclusion is supported by a game theoretic model examining the dominance of behaviors in case of timing uncertainty in general timing uncertainty casts a shadow on the future 11 that leads participants to respond early encouraging reciprocal behaviors and unequal contributions 3 introduction public good games pgg provide abstractions of many real world problems wherein personal and short term interests of multiple players are in conflict with societal long term interests 12 participants in such games can contribute voluntarily to a common good which can once established be accessed without restrictions by all thus even those that did not contribute rational selfish behavior stipulates that it is best to not contribute yet such decision would be detrimental as a group is better off when all contribute these games not only serve as a good model for many for social public benefits e g social security retirement funds but are also recurrent in many other collective endeavors from group hunting 13 14 to public health 3 15 18 and sociopolitical processes like climate change 1 6 19 22 we place our experimental within the collective risk dilemma crd 8 a variant of a pgg where a threshold makes the outcome of the game non linear and the collective benefit uncertain and only achievable in the future 23 25 this model has been adopted to address the complexity pertaining decision making under climate dilemmas 8 9 21 26 but its significance is general enough to be of interest to a broad range of human endeavors such as costly signaling voting or petitioning at the start of the game participants are each given an endowment and they must decide whether to contribute up to a predefined amount to the common good over a fixed number of rounds if the joint contributions of all the participants over those rounds are equal or above a certain threshold then the disaster is averted and they receive as a reward the remainder of the endowment hence the dilemma on the contrary if the target is not reached there is a probability that a disaster may occur resulting in economical loss for all the participants they lose the remainder of their endowment this is modelled by a risk parameter and both experiments and theoretical analysis show that people only tend to contribute to avoid the disaster if they perceive the risk to be high 8 20 22 26 29 moreover even when the risk is high theoretical models indicate that players tend to delay their contributions when the moment of disaster is known 21 30 both threshold pgg and crd make strong assumptions about what is known in the game each participant knows from the start how much they need to acquire collectively to reach the target and how much time they have to achieve this yet in real world scenario s the amount as well as the timing when it has to be achieved may not be certain as they are based on predictions and thus inherently suffer from uncertainties prior work on uncertainty about what amount threshold should be achieved in pgg 5 31 and crd 6 7 has shown that the level of cooperation i e the willingness to contribute in both games is negatively affected yet no insights exist on how timing uncertainty affects the decision making process to answer this question three experimental treatments are performed here first as a control treatment nu no uncertainty we investigated the behavior of groups of 6 participants wherein each can contribute 0 2 or 4 emus experimental monetary units at each of the 10 rounds of the experiment 0 10 when the group does not reach the target contribution of 120 emus by the 10 th round they risk losing the remainder of their initial endowment 40 emus with a 90 probability nu thus repeats the work of milinski et al 8 but without the climate change framing which avoids possible cultural effects due to climate awareness while enabling the generalization of our conclusions to other problems 4 captured by the crd conversely in the second treatment lu low uncertainty participants did not know exactly when the experiment would finish they were told the experiment lasts on average 10 rounds and that from round 0 8 there was a possibility that the game ends see supporting information si for instructions a 6 faces dice was thrown and the game would continue if the result was higher than 2 i e the game ends with a probability of 1 10 0 1 1 3 if the game continues the same process is repeated at the end of each round until the dice result indicated the end of the experiment the game can thus stop early at round 8 but also continue multiple rounds after round 10 finally for the third treatment hu high uncertainty we increased the uncertainty i e the variance of the distribution of final rounds by making 0 6 and 1 5 we throw a 10 faces dice in this case importantly we made sure that all participants are clearly informed in every treatment that the average number of rounds is 10 their understanding was tested before starting the experiment note that in all three treatments fair behavior would be to contribute in total half of one s endowment f e 2 as it would ensure that everyone has the same maximized gains and that the target is met figure 1 average investment in the public account a average group achievement b and average number of rounds used to reach the target c panel a shows the average investment per round and per group of 6 players for each treatment for nu black lines and triangles the groups invested per round on average the minimum amount required to reach the target by the end of the game 12 emus per round treatments lu red lines and stars and hu yellow lines and circles assume low and high timing uncertainty respectively even though the game would on average end at 10 rounds our results suggest that the higher the uncertainty on the timing of the final round higher the amount contributed at early stages of the game as a result when groups succeed in reaching the collective threshold they do so in a smaller number of rounds see panel c however these early investments did not lead on average to higher collective success instead in panel b we can see that the group achievement of hu is lower than nu and lu results a b c 5 in the absence of any timing uncertainty nu black lines and bars in figure 1 the experimental results show that groups can reach the target amount and that their investments per round follow closely the minimum required to reach the target by the end of the 10 th round figure 1 a figure 1 b shows that more than 65 of the groups were successful average group achievement these groups nonetheless reached the targeted amount only by the last round figure 1 c and those that did not were always very close to it indicating a failure in the final coordination on the contrary whenever timing uncertainty is present lu and hu individuals tend to contribute earlier in the game with the amount contributed per round increasing with the uncertainty on the game timeframe see figure 1 a figure s 1 in si provides similar conclusions when examining the average donations per round and per group the motivation behind each individual s decision to contribute early is certainly diverse in lu the investments are very close to the required donation per round for a game with only 8 rounds indeed as shown in figure 1 c groups that met the target in lu did this by round 8 on average while the fraction of groups that met the target did not change significantly figure 1 b see methods for statistical test this indicates that participants attempted to reduce the uncertainty of the game and the risk associated by investing earlier yet in hu the average investments were lower than those required to reach the target in 6 rounds see figure 1 a in this third treatment groups only managed to reach the target on average by round 8 see figure 1 c which indicates that uncertainty affects behavior see also figure s 2 in si in a way that is subtler than simply understanding lu and hu treatments as if players would be playing a distinct game with less rounds in other words under timing uncertainty individuals behave on average in a risk averse fashion reacting earlier to the collective dilemma and finding it unlikely that the game would end after the average number of rounds 10 in this case independent of when they try to reach the target if every participant invests half of his or her e then the target is reached and they all go home with the same gains this fair share f can be achieved by accumulating different combinations of 0 2 or 4 emus over the different rounds indeed we observe in the investments per round for the nu experiment that most participants giving f do not do this by giving 2 in every round only 15 11 out of 72 of all participants giving f and 20 10 out of 48 of the successful ones do this by always giving what could be the locally fair share fairness in this game is thus defined at the game level and not the round level now when considering within each group the cumulated investments over all rounds c one can observe that individuals react to uncertainty by either giving more or less than from f see figure 2 a this suggests that the presence of timing uncertainty not only leads to earlier investments as mentioned earlier but also promotes the emergence of polarized reactions and unequal contributions among participants with more players c deviating from f than when there is no uncertainty this observation is confirmed in hu see figure 2 a where the prevalence of unfair contributions increases further when compared with nu and lu this polarized pattern may suggest a co existence of risk averse and risk seeking individuals 32 33 depending on whether individuals base their choices on a number of rounds below or above the average of 10 rounds 6 the same cumulative data also reveals the shift towards early investments when considering players donations in the beginning and end of the game see figure 2 b our results show how participants distribute their donations over time by dividing the game into two halves from 1 0 2 and 0 2 i e half means 5 4 and 3 for nu lu and hu respectively the fraction of players whose c is more equal or less than half of the fair donation i e 2 is shown for the groups that reached the target in the treatments with uncertainty lu and hu the fraction of 2 players in the 1 st half is significantly higher than that of the 2 nd half which means that participants invest earlier to reach the target in contrast in nu there is a slight increase in 2 during the second half of the game this may be related to players trying to compensate for procrastination resulting in higher investments at the end moreover when comparing the donations between players that met and did not meet the target see figure s 3 in si the difference between the fraction of players that invest 2 in the 1 st half of the game grows with uncertainty this highlights the importance of investing earlier and not procrastinating under the presence of timing uncertainty figure 2 distribution of participant behavior and dependence on time fraction of players within successful groups that invest less equal or more than the fair donation if all participants of a group invest exactly they reach the target a and how these behaviors are distributed over the first and second halves 1 half means 5 4 and 3 rounds for nu lu and hu respectively of the game b panel a shows that as uncertainty increases more players invest either more or less than while the players that invest exactly decrease panel b shows how this behavior is spread across the game by showing the fraction of players that invest less equal or more than in each half of the game the plot shows that the investments in the first half of the game increase with uncertainty in comparison to nu not only do participants tend to invest earlier in the presence of timing uncertainty but their donations become dependent on what the group members did see figure 3 to the point that the predominant behavior in successful lu and hu resembles a group level reciprocal behavior 34 or tit for tat tft 10 35 such group reciprocal behavior or group conditional cooperation has also been observed in linear public good games without a threshold 36 37 and it has been identified experimentally as a beneficial strategy for climate action 38 nu lu hu nu lu hu a b total donation per game halftotal donation 7 although this behavior does not avoid free riding there is actually and increase as can be seen in figure 2 a it promotes generosity among the participants and appears necessary for a successful outcome in figure 3 we can see that there is a positive correlation between the group donations and the average donation of the players in lu and hu see correlations in table s 1 in si for the players that met the target in contrast the players that did not meet the target do not display the same conditional behavior or even to the same extent indicating that reciprocity is used here by the participants to achieve honest coordination in the presence of timing uncertainty figure 3 prevalence of group reciprocity for different uncertainty levels we show the average donation per player in function of the donations of the group members in the previous round without the focal player the plots are separated by treatment columns and by whether they met true or not false the target rows we fitted a weighted linear regression on each plot see methods this analysis shows that there is no significant dependency on the group donations for nu despite a slightly negative correlation factor for the players that reached the target which indicates a compensatory behavior however there is a significant dependency on the group donations under uncertainty lu and hu moreover for lu the groups that did not reach the target display a slight compensatory behavior in contrast to the reciprocal behavior of those that did inside each plot we show a subplot of the frequency of each action 0 2 and 4 for the different group donations these plots depict clearly how for lu and hu the frequency of action 4 increases with the group donation on the previous round while action 0 increases when the previous donations were low in comparison action 2 is predominant when there is no uncertainty or when groups did not achieve the goal lu hu the non trivial dynamics and behavioral ecology of switching from compensating to reciprocal behavior may be explained by a game theoretical model that describes the behavioral dynamics through an evolutionary process see methods for a full description given the strategy profiles identified in figure 3 human subjects mostly adhere to either unconditional investments or conditional strategies based on the level of investments in the previous round for simplicity we define here three unconditional heuristics or strategies i e always 2 gives 2 in every round always 4 invest gives 4 in each round always 0 invest nothing throughout the game and the two conditional ones i e compensator will invest 4 when the group members did not invest and reciprocal will invest 4 as long as the group 8 members invest all strategies will stop contributing once the collective target is achieved we consider a population of individuals who may adopt one of these five strategies and revise their choices based on the relative success of each strategy 39 see methods for details more advanced strategies could be considered yet even with this baseline model our experimental observations can be explained indeed the model confirms that under uncertainty the reciprocal strategy prevails among those strategies that contribute to the collective good see figure 4 a while capturing also that the group achievement does not change significantly with uncertainty moreover the model indicates that the always 2 strategy is only stable when there is no timing uncertainty see figure s 6 in si the presence of this type of uncertainty induces the population into cyclic dynamics where the dominance of direct reciprocity increases with uncertainty the model is also able to capture the inequality in contributions and the increase in polarization observed in the experiments see figure 4 b figure 4 emergence of reciprocal strategy and polarization in a stochastic evolutionary model panel a shows how that group achievement does not vary significantly with timing uncertainty left y axis while the predominance of the reciprocal strategy over the strategies that contribute to reach the target increases right y axis and boxes with slashes panel b shows that the polarization increases when there is timing uncertainty these results reproduce the trend observed in the experimental data see methods for a detailed explanation of the parameters discussion despite the simplicity of our experimental setup and associated theoretical model the trends identified may hold potential lessons for dealing with uncertainty in local and global governance our results show that contrary to the outcome for other types of uncertainty timing uncertainty promotes early investments by the participants moreover timing uncertainty appears to increase polarized reactions among the participants suggesting a co existence of risk prone and risk averse preferences while diminishing the a b group achievement proportion of reciprocals 9 number of players contributing a fair share and increasing those that give less or more interestingly our result relates nicely with recent findings in the context of behavioral dynamics in urban settings it has been shown that uncertainty associated with big cities intensified both risk seeking and risk taking reactions while the predictability of small villages encouraged more homogeneous and intermediate choices 40 such heterogeneity highlights the intricacy of the study of the emergence of polarized preferences beyond contagious processes 41 with potential implications in various socio political and ecological contexts at the same time conditional behaviors emerge in the presence of timing uncertainty and groups that were able to coordinate through reciprocal behavior were more successful than those that simply played a fixed strategy or compensated for those giving not enough this heavily contrasts with the predominant behavior when the length of the game is certain in which most players unconditionally opt for a fair share f our results suggest that when the future is uncertain and stakeholders are aware of it they tend to respond early encouraging others to reach the target together this effect may be potentially maximized when combined with communication institutions or costly commitments 20 42 45 acknowledgements e f d is supported a f w o fonds

methods experiments the results of our experiment were obtained by testing 246 participants 41 females that were divided into 41 groups of six subjects each in a computerized experiment using the software available at https github com socrats beelbe ethical approval was obtained from the ethical commission for human sciences at the vrije universiteit brussel to perform this experiment most of the participants were bachelor master students of either the universit libre de bruxelles or the vrije universiteit brussel the average age of participants was 24 with a standard deviation of 4 years during each session of the experiments participants were assigned randomly into groups and were not allowed to communicate physical barriers were set up between them participants never knew who the other members of their group were in the control treatment nu 12 groups played the collective risk dilemma see main text defined as in 8 with the difference that the game was not framed as a climate change scenario which makes the results more general to other scenarios of collective risk where there is an uncertain deadline indeed this type of n person dilemma combining non linear and uncertain returns which are only reached in the future are recurrent in many human collective endeavors from public health measures to group hunting in the treatment with low uncertainty lu and high uncertainty hu another 14 and 15 groups respectively played the variant of the game in which the final round was decided by a random process after a minimum number of rounds 8 rounds in lu and 6 in hu the probability of the game ending after each round was 1 3 and 1 5 in lu and hu respectively to implement this uncertainty in lu hu a 6 10 faces dice was thrown at the end of round 8 6 and the game would continue if the result was higher than 2 thus generating the probability for ending the game in lu hu identifying polarization of donations we divided the participants on our experiment based on their total donations throughout the game and their relationship to what we call fair donation this value corresponds to the minimum donation required for a group to be successful if all participants invest the same i e if all participants invest exactly the group will be successful this value corresponds to half of the endowment 2 therefore we quantify the fraction of participants that contribute in total less equal or more than in figure 2 we show that the fraction of participants that invest and grows with timing uncertainty while fair players diminish we associate this divergence of donations to an increase of polarized reactions identifying conditional behavior conditional behaviors were assessed through the analysis of the average donation of each player as a function of the donations of the other group members in the previous round see figure 3 for this reason the plot starts with the data after the first round also we only take into account the data of the experiment before the target is reached i e when the public account contains less than 120 emus we adopt a weighted linear regression so that samples with smaller errors were more important than those with large ones the weight of a point is calculated as 1 where the errors were computed as https github com socrats beelbe 11 1 1 here 4 representing the range of the values an action can take and indicates the number of samples used to calculate the average of the samples vector this way points calculated from only 1 sample almost do not count for the regression statistics in figure 1 a the averages and error bars 95 confidence interval are computed across groups n 12 for nu n 14 for lu and n 15 for hu for lu and hu after the minimum number of rounds 0 n decreases since some of the groups finished the game for lu 9 for round 9 6 for round 10 4 for round 11 2 until round 17 for hu 12 for round 7 7 for round 8 4 for round 9 2 until round 13 and 1 until round 19 in figure 1 b each box plot display the proportion of groups that were successful for each of the treatments 8 out of 12 groups were successful in nu 9 out of 14 for lu and 7 out of 15 for hu we performed a chi square test of independence 0 49952 41 2 2 1 38 that issues that the differences between the group achievements among the treatments are not significant the error bars in figure 1 c represent the 95 confidence interval this figure shows the average round in which successful groups reached the target n 8 for nu n 9 for lu and n 7 for hu in figure 2 we calculate the fraction of successful players for each treatment that assume one of 3 contribution behaviors the total number of players in each of the fractions is 9 21 18 for nu 13 17 24 for lu and 13 8 21 for hu the error bars in figure 3 were calculated as described in the identifying conditional behavior section see si for detail on the number of samples for the correlation analysis game theoretical model as an alternative to considering fully rational agents we describe the behavioral dynamics through an evolutionary process 46 in which individuals tend to copy those appearing to be more successful we consider a finite population of z individuals who interact in groups of size n in which they engage in the collective risk dilemma with multiple rounds each individual can adopt one of the ns 5 strategies that mimic the behaviors observed on the experimental data always 2 always 4 always 0 compensator and reciprocal the first three strategies are unconditional i e they will always invest the same independently of the behavior of the other group members differently compensator and reciprocal are conditional strategies that adapt their behavior to the rest of the group according to a threshold of total investments per round we consider this threshold to be 10 which is exactly half of the maximum investment per round without the focal player in this manner compensators always start investing 2 and afterwards invest 0 as long as the sum of contributions of the rest of group members in the previous round is above 10 units otherwise they will invest 4 emus the behavior of reciprocal is the exact opposite of compensators they start by investing 2 emus and afterwards they invest 4 emus as long the sum of contributions of the other members of the group in the previous rounds is above or equal to 10 units otherwise they invest 0 we do not assume any population structure such that individuals are equally likely to interact with each other the so called well mixed assumption the success or fitness of an individual can be computed as the average payoff obtained 12 from playing in multiple groups randomly sampled from the population as a result all individuals adopting one of the ns 5 strategies can be seen as equivalent on average to study the behavioral resulting from this set of strategies we adopt a stochastic birth death process combined with the pairwise comparison rule 39 to describe the social learning dynamics of each of the strategies in a finite population at each time step a randomly chosen individual has the opportunity to revise their strategy by imitating or not the strategy of a randomly selected member of the population b the imitation will occur with a probability which increases with the fitness difference between and here we adopt the fermi function 1 1 where controls the intensity of selection we use 0 003 and fa fb is the average fitness of in addition we consider that with a mutation probability individuals adopt a randomly chosen strategy freely exploring the strategy space overall this adaptive process defines a large scale markov process whose complete characterization becomes unfeasible as one increases the population size and number of strategies 47 however this analysis of this stochastic dynamics is largely simplified in the limit of rare mutations in this case we are able to compute analytically the relative prevalence of each of the different strategies moreover as shown in the supporting information by means of large scale computer simulations this analytical approximation turns out to be valid for much wider interval of mutation regimes in this limit when a new strategy appears through mutation one of two outcomes occurs long before the occurrence of a new mutation either the population faces the fixation of newly introduced strategy or the mutant strategy is wiped out from the population hence there will be a maximum of two strategies present simultaneously in the population 48 49 this allows one to describe the behavioral dynamics in terms of a reduced markov chain of size 5 whose transitions are defined by the fixation probabilities of a single mutant with strategy in a population of individuals adopting another strategy this probability is given by 1 1 1 1 1 39 50 51 where is the probability to decrease increase the number of individuals with the mutant strategy 1 1 in the limit of neutral selection 0 the fixation probabilities become independent of the fitness values and equal to 1 z offering a convenient reference scenario see below since we will have at most two different strategies in the population we can calculate the fitness of a strategy in a finite population of size and individuals of strategy and of strategy as 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 27 where 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 represents a hypergeometric sampling sampling without replacement of the population and 1 is the payoff of strategy when facing strategy while the group is composed of 1 individuals with strategy we numerically estimate pairwise payoffs between every strategy pair and for each possible composition of a group of participants with members of using strategy and using strategy this is achieved by averaging over 103 games for each composition of the group and treatments nu lu and hu using the same parameters adopted in the lab experiments equipped with these tools one can now compute the prevalence of each strategy through the stationary distribution pw of the ns states markov chain the stationary distribution characterizes the average time the population spends in each monomorphic state w this can be computed analytically as the normalized 13 eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue 1 of the transposed of the transition matrix m of the markov chain 48 49 51 with all fixation probabilities to compute the expected group achievement shown in figure 4 a we weight the probability of success of each of the monomorphic states populations with only one of the 5 strategies by their predominance given by the stationary distribution i e where is a row vector containing the stationary distribution and is a column vector containing the probability of success of each monomorphic state in our case the probability of success is always 1 for populations of always 2 reciprocal and always 4 players while it is 0 for always 0 compensators are only successful if the game lasts more than 10 rounds therefore their probability of success is 1 10 0 since the random process that decides the final round under timing uncertainty follows a geometric distribution the calculation of the fraction of players that contribute less equal or more than used in figure 4 b is done in a similar fashion in this case we need to calculate the probability that a population consisting of each of the monomorphic states will contribute since we can calculate the contributions of the players depending on the number of rounds of the game the computation of these probabilities is straightforward the always 2 players will always invest always 4 and reciprocal will contribute and always 0 once more compensators will only contribute if the number of rounds is bigger than 10 otherwise they contribute we then multiply these probabilities by the stationary distribution to obtain the fraction of players that assume each of the previous behaviors in figure 4 all other parameters controlling the environment are set to be the same as in our lab experiments the risk 0 9 the initial endowment 40 and the target is 120 to obtain further intuition behind the emergence of cooperation group achievement and strategies in each treatment we also analyze the typical flow of probability between the different monomorphic states in the presence and absence of uncertainty see invasion diagrams in figure s 6 arrows represent transitions favored by natural selection i e those whose fixation probability exceeds 1 z associated with the fixation probability of a mutant under neutral evolution a strategy for which no mutant adopting any other strategy has a selective advantage is said to be an evolutionary robust strategy ers 52 a convenient measure of strategic stability in this context as shown in figure s 6 timing uncertainty changes the set of evolutionary robust strategies benefiting the flow of probabilities towards the adoption of reciprocal strategies references 1 barrett s collective action to avoid

ndez domingos jelena gruji juan c burguillo georg kirchsteiger francisco c santos and tom lenaerts nomenclature for the remainder of this document we will refer to each one of the 3 treatments analyzed in this manuscript in the following way treatment 1 no uncertainty treatment nu treatment 2 low uncertainty treatment lu treatment 3 high uncertainty treatment hu extended methods experimental procedure during each session of the experiment all participants were required to read the instructions on the screen of their assigned computer before the start the same instructions were provided on a printed copy that they could consult throughout the experiment after reading all participants went through a test with the goal to check their understanding in case of problems the coordinators discussed with them their errors ensuring that everything was clear throughout the experiment each participant observed on his or her screen the amount left in his or her private account and the actions of each of the group members in the previous round they are thus able to keep track of the behavior of their group mates but do not know their identity they could not observe the current state of the public account yet they were encouraged to keep track of it by asking them how much they believe is in the account at each round after the final round in the treatment with uncertainty they could observe the result of the random value produced by the dice that defined the end of the game the participants could see on the screen how much was invested in the public account in total and how much was left in their private account as well as the conversion to euros in the case this value was below the target a message would show the result of the dice that decided whether they would lose or not the remaining endowment finally before the participants were allowed to leave the laboratory they were requested to complete a small survey about their experience during the experiment 2 our experiment models the effect of timing uncertainty on the collective risk dilemma therefore there is a stochastic component that we must explain to participants carefully in order to do this we used the known example of a virtual dice for instance to explain that there is a probability of 1 3 that the game would finish after round 8 in the low uncertainty lu treatment we explain that the computer will throw a virtual dice of 6 faces and if the result is either 1 or 2 then the game will end we also tell participants that on average the game takes 10 rounds to give them an intuition about the distribution of this stochastic process the details of the instructions for all three treatments can be found in the following sections instructions for the control treatment no uncertainty nu each participant had access to the following instructions both in digital and paper format instructions to the experiment welcome to this experiment where you can earn money you are about to participate in an experiment on iterative decision making conducted by researchers from the vrije universiteit brussel and the universit libre de bruxelles in this experiment you will earn some money and the amount will be determined by your choices and the choices of the other participants your privacy is guaranteed the other participants will not know who you are during the experiment and the results of the experiment are stored in an anonymous manner it is very important that you remain silent during the whole experiment and that you never communicate with other participants neither verbally nor in any other way when in doubt or when you have a question please just raise your hand and an experimenter will approach you if you do not remain silent or if you behave in any way that could potentially disturb the experiment you will be asked to leave the laboratory and you will not be paid all your earnings during the experiment will be expressed in experimental monetary units emus which will be transformed into euros with a change rate of 0 75 euro to 1 emu at the end of the experiment a show up fee of 2 5 euros will be added to your earnings you will be paid privately by bank transfer to your account within a week after the experiment at the end of the experiment you will be requested to provide your iban number and bic code to make the transfer 3 before starting you will be randomly assigned into a group you will never know the identity of the other participants of the group however the experiment takes 10 rounds and you will be able to observe the actions of the previous round of every member of your group starting from round 2 login to the experiment before the experiment can start please enter the user login and password you have been given into the login page displayed in the browser of the computer assigned to you once you have logged in you will be able to see on your screen the same instructions that are written on this paper wait for the instructor s signal before you proceed general information at the beginning of the experiment you will be randomly assigned to a group which will include 5 other randomly selected participants during the whole experiment you will interact only with those 5 other group members at the beginning of the experiment you and each other group member will receive a personal endowment of 40 emus the whole experiment consists of 10 rounds of the following game in each round of the game you have to decide whether to add 0 2 or 4 emus in a public account if the public account contains at least 120 emus after the 10 th round each member of your group will keep their savings i e the emus of your endowment that were not put in the public account 4 however if this minimum is not reached the computer will throw a virtual dice and each group member will lose his or her remaining emus with a 90 chance 9 times out of 10 thus with a 10 chance 1 out of 10 you will keep the remaining emus in your private account course of action every round has the same structure and consists of the following steps step 1 choice of how much to contribute 0 2 or 4 step 2 make a prediction about the amount in the public account when the experiment reaches its final round you will move to the final 3 rd step step 3 check if the threshold of the public account has been achieved and calculation of final payoffs step 1 the contribution choice in the step 1 every member will be asked how many emus do you want to contribute to the public account three buttons are provided 0 2 and 4 emus you can select the amount by clicking the button as is shown in the figure below image 1 view of step 1 on the right side of the screen you can see the time you have left to make your decision and the amount of emus in your personal account you must make your decision within 5 the time displayed on the screen the time left square will start blinking when you are getting out of time nothing happens when the time runs out yet if you take too long to make a decision the experiment will take too long please respond as quickly as possible the table donations of the previous round shows the values donated by all the members of your group in the previous round in the first column you see your own donation from the previous round in the other columns you see the decisions of the other users the choice of each group member will always be shown in the same column this information about the previous donations is only available after the first round step 2 predict the content of the public account after step 1 you will go to a next screen on this screen you are asked the following question please estimate the current total content of the public account you should enter an estimation of how many emus you think the public account contains in total after all members including you have made their donations in the current round this is an example of what you will see in this step image 2 view of step 2 step 3 last round and calculation of final payoffs after the last round you will jump to a final screen if the accumulated contributions to the account are equal or higher than 120 emus then you will be informed that you can keep the amount of the endowment that you did not put in the public account for example if you put in total 20 emus of your endowment 40 emus in the public account during the experiment you will gain the remaining 20 emus i e 40 20 this amount is converted into euro s the screen will show the following text congratulations your group collected xxx emus which is greater or equal to 120 emus so you may keep the amount remaining in 6 your private account please fill in the amount in euro s you see on this screen on the payment document you received before clicking the continue button this amount consists of both your private winnings and the show up fee however if the minimum of 120 emus is not reached the computer will throw a virtual dice and all group members will lose all their remaining emus with a 90 chance there are thus two possible outcomes on one hand with a chance of 9 out of 10 the screen will show your group collected xxx emus which is lower than 120 emus the server has generated a random number between 1 and 100 the resulting value is yyy which is smaller than 91 this means that you all lose the remaining endowment in your private accounts please fill in the amount in euro s you see on this screen on the payment document you received before clicking the continue button this amount is the show up fee on the other hand with a chance of 1 out of 10 the screen will show your group collected xxx emus which is lower than 120 emus the server has generated a random number between 1 and 100 the resulting value is yyy which is bigger than 90 this means that you all win the remaining endowment in your private accounts please fill in the amount in euro s you see on this screen on the payment document you received before clicking the continue button this amount consists of both your private winnings and the show up fee end of experiment questionnaire at the end of the experiment you will be directed to a form containing a short questionnaire please answer to all the questions honestly the information you add here is an important part of this experiment any information that you may include in this form will remain completely anonymous and cannot be linked to you in any way once you have finished filling in the questionnaire please click the button submit at the end of the experiment you will be called by one of the organisers to make the payment official please stay seated and do not talk until you are called and have left the room please note communication is not allowed during the whole experiment if you have a question please raise your hand 7 all decisions are made anonymously i e no other participant learns the identity of the other decision makers the payment is also anonymous no participant learns from us about the amount that another participant received in the experiment instructions for the low uncertainty treatment lu the instructions of the treatment with low timing uncertainty differ slightly from that of the previous treatment below we describe only the sections that change with respect to the control treatment nu instructions to the experiment before starting you will be randomly assigned into a group you will never know the identity of the other participants of the group however the experiment takes at least 8 rounds and you will be able to observe the actions of the previous round of every member of your group starting from round 2 general information the whole experiment consists of minimum 8 and on average 10 rounds but it could be more than that the probability that the next round will happen after round 8 is 2 3 this means that at the end of each round starting from round 8 a virtual fair dice with 6 faces will be thrown if the result is 1 or 2 the game will end otherwise when the result is 3 4 5 or 6 the game will continue to the next round in which the process is repeated if the public account contains at least 120 emus after the final round each member of your group will keep their savings i e the emus of your endowment that were not put in the public account course of action every round has the same structure and consists of the following steps step 1 choice of how much to contribute 0 2 or 4 8 step 2 make a prediction about the amount in the public account the end of the experiment is decided by a random process starting from round 8 the game will go through a 3 rd step step 3 check if the experiment should end by throwing a virtual fair dice when the experiment reaches its final round you will move to the final 4 th step step 4 check if the threshold of the public account has been achieved and calculation of final payoffs step 3 check if the game should end the probability that the next round will happen after round 8 is 2 3 this means that at the end of each round starting from round 8 a virtual fair dice with 6 faces will be thrown if the result is 1 or 2 the game will end otherwise when the result is 3 4 5 or 6 the game will continue to the next round in which the process is repeated this means that the experiment will have a minimum of 8 rounds there is a virtual fair dice for each group thus the experiment can have different rounds depending on which group you are in you will be able to see on the screen the following text if the game continues the result of the dice was x which is different from 1 or 2 therefore the experiment will continue to the next round please click now on the button ok however if the result of the dice is 1 or 2 the screen will show the following text the result of the dice was x therefore the experiment will end please click now on the button ok instructions the high uncertainty treatment hu the instructions for the treatment with high timing uncertainty differ from treatment 2 low timing uncertainty only in that the minimum number of rounds is 6 and the probability that the game ends afterwards is 1 5 or 2 10 however the average number of rounds remains 10 below we describe only the sections that differ from the lu treatment 9 general information the whole experiment consists of minimum 6 and on average 10 rounds but it could be more than that the probability that the next round will happen after round 6 is 8 10 this means that at the end of each round starting from round 6 a virtual fair dice with 10 faces will be thrown if the result is 1 or 2 the game will end otherwise when the result is 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 the game will continue to the next round in which the process is repeated step 3 check if the game should end the probability that the next round will happen after round 6 is 8 10 this means that at the end of each round starting from round 6 a virtual fair dice with 10 faces will be thrown if the result is 1 or 2 the game will end otherwise when the result is 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 the game will continue to the next round in which the process is repeated this means that the experiment will have a minimum of 6 rounds testing participant s understanding after reading the instruction participants are requested to complete a short questionnaire that tests their understanding participants are not allowed to start the experiment until they answer to all questions correctly 10 supplementary experimental results in figure 1 of the main text we display the averaged cumulative contributions per group for each of the 3 treatments of our experiment in figure s 1 we present the average contributions per round here we observe that for the successful groups met target true the investments in the treatments with uncertainty were always higher than in the control treatment nu before the minimum number of rounds the figure also shows that for nu the difference between successful groups and non successful ones is mostly related to the contributions in the last two rounds while the successful groups increase their contributions slightly by the end compensate for other participants the non successful groups lower them this highlights the importance of coordination when the time is certain for the treatments with timing uncertainty this effect disappears and successful groups contribute more and earlier to reveal the differences between the treatments we used a t sne 2 d visualization figure s 2 of the multidimensional vector that represents each participant which is represented by a tuple of the actions she took at each round and the total donations of their group mates in the previous round this representation is able to cluster with some noise the participants of each treatment which allows us to confirm visually that there are differences between them each color in the figure represents one treatment and the colors are the same as those in figure 1 of the main manuscript nu black lu red hu yellow in figure s 3 we show a comparison between the participants behaviors in the first and second parts of the game for the participants that met the target this corresponds to figure 2 of the main manuscript and those that didn t we can observe an increasing difference between the generous players those that invest c f 2 in the first half of the game as timing uncertainty grows this highlights the importance of early investments to nudge participants into cooperation when there is a shadow on the future figure s 4 shows the frequency of each of the 3 possible actions depending on the group investments without the focal player in the previous round this figure combines the participants from both the successful met the target and unsuccessful sessions while in the treatment without timing uncertainty action 2 is predominant in the treatment with uncertainty we observe and increase of the extreme actions 0 and 4 moreover action 4 occurs with higher frequency when the previous donations of the other members of the group were higher than 10 and action 0 when they were lower 11 we have also extended our analysis of the conditional behavior to study how it depends on time first half and second half of the game and on the previous action of the focal player yet these results must be analyzed with care since the amount of data used to calculate each point becomes smaller with each new feature taken into account which is reflected in the error bars of the figures figure s 5 indicates that there are differences in conditional behavior depending on the half of the game this is expected since figure 2 of the main text already shows that in the treatments with timing uncertainty the investments are higher in the first half error reference source not found shows the correlation results and the associated p values for the results presented in figure 3 of the main text the correlations for the treatment without uncertainty are negative which indicates a compensatory behavior for the treatments with uncertainty however these correlations are positive indicating a reciprocal or tit for tat behavior nevertheless only the correlations for the successful players of lu and hu are statistically significant p 0 001 dependency analysis the results in table s 2 s 4 are all obtained using an ordered logistic regression or cumulative link model 1 implemented in the polr function implemented in the mass package in r we estimate the probability of taking an action 0 2 and 4 depending on a series of features this allows us to study how the actions of the participants on the experiment depend on these features we used this analysis to select the most relevant features for the behavioral representation of a participant which was then used to produce the results of figure 2 and 3 of the main manuscript the polr function differs from a multimodal regression in that it performs a ordered logistic regression i e it takes into account the order of the labels this is important in our case since the donations 0 2 or 4 are ordered the features included in the regression are public account the public account of the game i e the cumulative sum of investments of all participants private account the private account of the participant i e the remaining endowment at a given round round donations others the donations of the members of the group in

shows a 2 dimensional representation of the behavior of each player based on decisions taken by the individuals and their group mates similar behaviors are positioned in nearby points and dissimilar ones are characterized by distant points we can observe that the data points of each treatment form clusters which suggests that the behavior of participants is different in each treatment the axis

first and second half of the game if every player invested in total during the game the group would reach the target with exactly 120 emus for t 2 and t 3 we consider half of the game to be we can observe that the number of participants that invest more than in the first half of the game non procrastinators increase considerably in the treatments with uncertainty it is also noticeable that the difference in the fraction of non procrastinators between the groups that met and did not meet the target increases with uncertainty figure s 4 conditional behavior per treatment distribution of actions in function of the donations of the group members without the focal player in the previous round in nu on the left players display an almost uniform behavior over the set of donations of their group members in the previous round 2 is the predominant action nu lu hu nu lu hu successful groups non successful groups c f 2 c f 2 c f 2 0 042 0 189 0 208 15 with an increase of action 4 when the group members donated a total of 4 related to the players trying to compensate for their teammates on the last rounds in contrast in the treatments with timing uncertainty center and right players are more likely to donate 4 when their group members donated over 10 emus in the previous round and increase their 0 donations when the group members do the same which corresponds to a tit for tat

high uncertainty similar to the low uncertainty case for high uncertainty we can observe that both time and the donations of other in the group are relevant features polynomial fitting our analysis until now was mostly focused on identifying linear correlations and their sign between participants contributions and the contributions of their group mates this choice allows us to extract meaningful relationships while avoiding overfitting however in some of the studied cases as we would expect the data dependency might be represented better by a curvilinear polynomial model below we show that the conclusions presented in the main manuscript remain valid if high order fitting is chosen in tables s 5 s 10 we display the results of an anova test that compares polynomial regressions of different order from 1 to 4 for all the 6 cases analyzed in figure 3 of the main manuscript this test indicates whether increasing the order of the polynomial regression issues a significant improvement in only 3 cases a polynomial fit is significantly better than the linear model no uncertainty and players meeting the target low uncertainty and not meeting the target and high uncertainty and not 20 meeting the target in figure s 6 we show results analogous to figure 3 of the main manuscript but using the model that fits the best each case we show that our conclusions do not change and perhaps it is even clearer that in the certainty case when players meet the target they adopt a slightly compensatory behavior while considerably lowering their contributions when the rest of the

of conditional behavior using the best fitting model for each case applying the best fitting model identified through our tests to each treatment does not change our conclusions but highlights that on the certainty treatment when players meet the collective target they display a slight compensatory behavior while considerably lowering their contributions when the rest of the group adopt extreme actions they donate either too much or too little supplementary model results here we show additional results of our evolutionary game theoretical model 2 4 as fully detailed in the methods section we consider five representative strategies encountered in our experiments always 0 al 0 always 2 al 2 always 4 al 4 compensator comp and reciprocal reci the first three strategies always invest the same 0 2 and 4 respectively independently of the behavior of their opponents compensators only invest when the group members did not invest and reciprocal players will invest as long as the group members are always investing see methods for details all strategies stop investing once the threshold is reached we analyze the behavioral dynamics in large but finite populations when individuals revise their choice through imitation dynamics or social learning 5 7 0 5 10 15 20 0 5 10 15 20 0 5 10 15 20 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4 group donations of the previous round without the focal player av g d on at io

step the strategy of one randomly selected individual a is updated with probability a undergoes a mutation with probability 1 another randomly selected individual b acts as a role model for a the probability that a adopts the strategy of b equals p 1 a sticks to his her former strategy with probability 1 p this update rule is known as the pairwise comparison rule 7 where fa and fb denote the fitness of individual a and b respectively as defined in the methods section the parameter 0 measures the strength of selection in the limit of strong selection the probability p is either zero or one in the limit of weak selection 0 p is always equal to 1 2 irrespective of the fitness of a and b we have checked that our results are qualitatively invariant for a broad range of values of if the mutation probability is sufficiently small the time between two mutation events is so large that before the next mutation occurs the population will evolve to a configuration in which all individuals adopt the same strategy in this case the dynamics can be approximated by means of a markov chain whose states correspond to the five homogeneous states of the population for each of the five strategies studied here the transitions of this markov chain are defined by the fixation probabilities of a single mutant with strategy j in a population of individuals adopting another strategy i the transition matrix combines the different probabilities that a population in a homogeneous state si will end up in state sj after the occurrence of one single mutation this matrix is given by whereas the diagonal of the transition matrix is defined by 1 note that 4 is the number of strategies minus one the normalized left eigenvector associated with eigenvalue 1 of matrix determines the stationary distribution i e the fraction of time the population spends in each of the homogeneous states in the limit of neutral selection 0 the fixation probabilities become independent of the fitness values and equal to 1 z offering a convenient reference scenario 24 transitions above this threshold are said to be favored by natural selection in figure s 6 we show these transitions for two of the most paradigmatic scenarios nu and hu for instance if an arrow goes from a state with strategy to state with strategy it indicates that a mutant of strategy will invade the population of strategy with a probability which is higher than the one we obtain from neutral drift the absence of an arrow indicates that such transition will occur with a low probability i e with a probability lower than 1 z in this context a strategy is said to be evolutionary robust ers 3 4 if no mutant adopting any other strategy has a selective advantage in other words we can identify strategies that are evolutionary robust a measure of stability by noticing that there is no arrow emerging from its respective node see figure s 6 figure s 6 illustrates a reference scenario in what concerns the invasion dynamics of strategies in the absence of uncertainty always 0 and the always 2 strategy are the only two evolutionary robust strategies moreover given the number and strength of the transitions the fair strategy can easily become the most prevalent behavior differently under high timing uncertainty the always 2 strategy starts to be invaded by compensators and always 0 figure s 7 b changing the ecology of behaviors observed in the absence of uncertainty in fact uncertainty can easily lead to complex behavioral dynamics with cyclic dominances and no evolutionary robust strategies as illustrated in the right panel of figure s 6 reciprocators can invade always 0 yet losing to compensators which in turn are invaded by always 0 from this cyclic dynamic even if not stable both conditional strategies emerge as prevailing strategies leading both to the emergence of reciprocity and polarization see main text the limit of rare mutations allows us to conveniently employ a small scale markov chain to analytically compute the prevalence of each strategy this is achieved by restricting the number of strategies simultaneously co existing in a population and groups to a maximum of two however for arbitrary mutation rates we may have a complex co existence of more than two strategies calling for the adoption of large scale computer simulations to confirm the validity of our theoretical results in other mutation or exploration regimes to perform these computer simulations we mimic 25 the evolutionary process described above with discrete steps involving imitation and mutation yet without any constraint in the value of here a free variable at the beginning of each simulation each individual randomly adopts one of the five strategies in each generation z individuals are chosen to revise their strategy in an asynchronous manner for each combination of parameters we run 30 simulations each lasting 10 generations the fitness of each individual a is calculated as the average return earned from 10 games played against n 1 individuals randomly selected from the population the group achievement is computed from the average fraction of groups that surpassed the threshold after a transient period of 10 generations the same criterion is used to compute the overall level of polarization emerging from each simulation in figure s 8 we confirm that the stationary distribution obtained under the small mutation limit assumption is valid for a wide range of mutation values additionally we also include the polarization results considering only group combinations that achieve the target with and without mutation see figure s 9 showing that results discussed in the main text remain valid for a broad interval of exploration rates figure s 7 markov chain depicting the transition probabilities between states in panel a we show the markov chain when there is no timing uncertainty an arrow that goes from state to indicates that a population in state where all members of the population are of strategy will transition to strategy with a probability higher than random drift the number on top of each state indicates the stationary distribution al 2 al 0 al 4 al 2 al 4 al 0 a b 26 i e the time the population spends in that state when there is no timing uncertainty always 2 is an evolutionary stable strategy all arrows point to it and none goes out however in the high timing uncertainty case panel b it becomes dominated by always 0 also reciprocal strategy weakly dominates always 0 resulting in a cyclic dynamic no strategy dominates this explain the reduction in always 2 players and the increase of reciprocals figure s 8 influence of noise mutation in the stationary distribution this figure shows how the stationary distribution of the monomorphic states only one strategy in the population is affected by the mutation probability the probability that a random mutant appears in the population the results show that the small mutation assumption in the theoretical model is valid for a large value of mutation probabilities both in the case of no uncertainty panel a and high uncertainty panel b only for mutation values higher than does the distribution get significantly affected in this case mixed states more than one strategy survives in the population become more common always 2 always 0 always 4 reciprocal compensator a b high uncertainty no uncertainty 27 figure s 9 distribution of donations when only considering successful groups in panel a we show the fraction of the population that invests more less or equal to the fair donation f considering only groups that achieve the target we can observe that while in the no uncertainty nu case successful groups either invest equal or above f an important fraction of the population invests below f in the timing uncertainty cases this indicates the emergence of polarization with timing uncertainty as we observed in the experiments in panel b we show the same results but considering a mutation rate here our model results matches closely the experimental results for nu while it predicts an even more extreme case of polarization for lu and hu references 1 liu i
