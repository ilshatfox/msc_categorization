data backup network formation with heterogeneous agents extended abstract harshit jaina guduru sai tejaa pramod manea kapil ahujaa and nagarajan krishnamurthyb abstract social storage systems 1 2 3 are becoming increasingly popular compared to the existing data backup systems like local centralized and p 2 p systems an endogenously built symmetric social storage model and its aspects like the utility of each agent bilateral stability contentment and efficiency have been extensively discussed in 4 we include heterogeneity in this model by using the concept of social range matrix from 5 now each agent is concerned about its perceived utility which is a linear combination of its utility as well as others utilities depending upon whether the pair are friends enemies or do not care about each other we derive conditions when two agents may want to add or delete a link and provide an algorithm that checks if a bilaterally stable network is possible or not finally we take some special social range matrices and prove that under certain conditions on network parameters a bilaterally stable network is unique index terms social storage f 2 f backup system endoge nous and heterogeneous network formation bilateral stability i introduction and motivation in recent years social storage friend to friend is emerging as an alternative to local e g hard disc online e g cloud and peer to peer data backup systems social storage allows users to store their data on their social relatives e g friends colleagues family etc storage devices researchers believe that social relationships which are at the core of social storage help to mitigate issues like data availability reliability and security initial work in this field has primarily focused on developing techniques to exogenously build social storage systems and performing quality of services qos analysis in terms of data reliability and availability in these systems a most recent study in 4 focuses on explicit data backup partner selection where agents themselves select their partners this selection is studied in a strategic setting and eventually builds a social storage network they model a utility function which reveals the benefit an individual receives in a social storage network further they analyze the network by using bilateral stability as a solution concept where no pair of agents add or delete a link without their mutual consent there are several advantages of this approach first this approach makes it possible to incorporate user s strategic behavior in terms of with whom user wants to form social connections and with whom it does not second this approach aauthors are with the iit indore corresponding author kapil ahuja s email kahuja iiti ac in bauthor is with the iim indore helps us to predict the following which network is likely to emerge which one is stable in which no individual has incentives to alter the structure of the network either by forming new or deleting existing social connections and which one is the best contended and or efficient from all the participants point of view however the above strategic setting does not consider het erogeneous behavior e g selfless selfish etc in the network formation in this paper we focus on this aspect this way we make the model close to a real world scenario although doing so makes it challenging to deal with the model and as well as predict its outcome to achieve the above we incorporate the concept of social range matrix introduced in 5 while exploring different social relationships between agents we modify the utility of agents in the social storage model discussed in 4 further we revisit the results regarding bilateral stability of such a model ii model our model is composed of four components first is sym metric social storage second is the utility as derived in 4 of each agent third is social range matrix which captures the social relationship between these agents fourth is the perceived utility obtained by combining the second and the third components a symmetric social network g is a data backup network consisting of n number of agents and a set of links connecting these agents a link ij g represents that the agents i and j are data backup partners who store their data on each other s shared storage space in g pairs of agents share an equal amount of storage space agents perform two actions link addition represented by g ij and deletion represented by g ij the utility function in 4 reveals the cost and benefit that each agent i receives in g and is given by ui g 1 ni g c ni g this utility function ui g consists of the following param eters the agent i s neighborhood size ni g the benefit associated with data the cost c that the agent i incurs to maintain its neighbours and the probability of disk failure note that c and lie between 0 and 1 the utility function is a combination of two objectives for each agent i the first is to minimize the total cost of the links which is c ni g the second is to maximize the expected data backup benefit ar x iv 1 71 1 10 28 3 v 1 cs m a 2 8 n ov 2 01 7 which is 1 ni g note that from now onwards we will use ni to represent neighbourhood size of agent i in g in our model we consider three type of agents first where an agent helps to maximize other s utility friend second where an agent aims to decrease other s utility enemy third where an agent does not care about other s utility neutral based upon 5 we represent the above kind of social relationships between pairs of agents in a social range matrix f here each element fij denotes the above discussed social relationship between i and j that is fij 0 i and j are friend of each other 0 i and j are enemy of each other and 0 i and j do not care about each other also j the set of all agents including i and fii 0 many such interesting matrices are possible for example a matrix of all ones mean that all pair of agents are friends and a matrix of all zeroes except the diagonal elements means weak social links in our paper for the sake of simplicity we use only three values for fij that is 1 1 and 0 indicating friend enemy neutral respectively we also consider that agents give more importance to other agents utilities than their own utility i e fii fij for all j now agents have different social relationships with others and hence their utility not only depends on the structure of the network but also their social relationships with others we define the new utility of agent i in g as the perceived utility which is defined as follows u i g j fijuj g 1 in this setting each agent s objective is to maximize its perceived utility which takes care of utilities of other agents thus the optimization problem is max u i g iii condition for link addition and deletion link addition between an agent i and an agent j occurs only when the perceived utilities of both the agents increases i e u i g ij u i g 2 and u j g ij u j g 3 for all agents k except i and j the neighbourhood size nk remains constant so their utility is the same and cancels out simplifying 2 and 3 with 1 we get that link addition happens when fii ni fij nj fii fij c 1 and 4 fii nj fij ni fii fij c 1 5 similarly link deletion happens when u i g ij u i g and u j g ij u j g thus equivalent to 4 and 5 we get link deletion conditions as below fii ni fij nj fii fij c 1 and 6 fii nj fij ni fii fij c 1 7 iv sufficiency condition for link addition theorem 1 for any two agents i and j let t 1 max ni nj t 2 min ni nj and fij 0 if t 1 ln c 1 ln the link addition conditions 4 and 5 will be true and hence a link will be formed between i and j proof case 1 if ni nj then t 1 ni and t 2 nj thus ni nj since 0 1 or fii ni fii nj since fii 0 also fij ni fij nj since fij 0 combining above two we get fii fij ni fii ni fij nj fii fij nj 8 and fii fij ni fii nj fij ni fii fij nj 9 using 4 5 in 8 9 we get sufficiency condition for link addition as below fii fij ni fii fij c 1 10 on solving 10 we get that link between i j will happen if ni ln c 1 ln case 2 if ni nj since 4 and 5 are symmetric interchange i and j similarly we can derive sufficiency conditions when fij 0 above as well as for link deletion algorithm 1 lists the steps for reaching a bilaterally stable network that is when no agent has any incentive to add or delete a link v case study consider five agents as follows a b c d and e assume that social relationships between these agents is captured in the social range matrix f given in table i as an example the way to read this matrix is as follows a is a friend of b and d while it is an enemy of c and e let us also assume that c 0 01 0 2 0 1 and 0 1 initially all agents are isolated i e the starting algorithm 1 pseudo code to arrive at a bilaterally stable network input c f starting network flag 1 comment i and j are agents flag 1 means network is not bilaterally stable 1 while flag 1 do 2 flag 0 3 for i 1 to n do 4 for j 1 to n do 5 if i 6 j then 6 if link is absent between i j then 7 check link addition conditions 4 and 5 for i j and add link if they are true 8 flag 1 9 end 10 if link is present between i j then 11 check link deletion conditions 6 and 7 for i j and delete link if they are true 12 flag 1 13 end 14 end 15 end 16 end 17 end table i social range matrix f a b c d e a 1 1 1 1 b 1 1 1 1 c 1 1 1 1 d 1 1 1 1 e 1 1 1 1 network is a null network we follow the procedure described in algorithm 1 and obtain the bilaterally stable network g shown in fig 1 with the same set of parameters and f by starting from a random non null network we obtain a different bilaterally stable network than in fig 1 this implies that bilaterally stable networks are not necessarily unique by looking at the ratio of c where 0 c 1 0 2 and above f we found that for 0 044 c 0 089 algorithm 1 runs into infinite loop implying that no bilaterally stable network is possible interestingly for all other values of c we found that at least one bilaterally stable network exists if c 0 2 and above f then we get a unique bilaterally stable network in which all pair of agents are enemies vi unique bilaterally stable networks lemma 1 if c 1 n 2 and if all agents are friends of each other i e fij 1 then a complete network is the unique bilaterally stable network fig 1 bilaterally stable social storage network g proof first consider the link addition conditions stated in 4 and 5 we can observe that as ni and nj increases the l h s of 4 and 5 decreases this implies that agents have an incentive to increase their neighborhood size if the link addition conditions 4 and 5 are true for ni nj n 2 both agents have the neighborhood size one less than the maximum possible size 1 then they will be true for all values of ni nj n 2 if the smaller value of the l h s is greater than the r h s bigger values will be greater solving 4 5 with ni nj n 2 i e fii n 2 fij n 2 fii fij c 1 gives c 1 n 2 a similar analysis can be done with the deletion conditions lemma 2 if c 1 and if all agents are friends of each other i e fij 1 then the empty network is the unique bilaterally stable network proof similar to lemma 1 corollary 1 if c 1 1 fii 1 and if fij is either 1 or 1 then the bilaterally stable network will be the one where all the pairs of enemies form links vii future work in this work we have extended the social storage model proposed in 4 to include heterogeneous behavior variety of social relationships after that we have analyzed this model using their solution concept of bilateral stability the preliminary results here give tremendous insight into how a endogenously built social storage system would emerge future work involves further analyzing the stability of such networks as well as studying contentment when everyone has maximized their utility and efficiency where the total utility of the network is maximized in this new heterogeneous agent scenario references 1 n tran f chiang and j li efficient
