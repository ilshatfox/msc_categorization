current draft april 26 2021 first draft february 1 2012 an empirical assessment of characteristics and optimal portfolios christopher g lamoureux and huacheng zhang abstract we analyze characteristics joint predictive information through the lens of out of sample power utility functions linking weights to characteristics to form optimal portfolios suffers from estima tion error which we mitigate by maximizing an in sample loss function that is more concave than the utility function while no single characteristic can be used to enhance utility by all investors conditioning on momentum size and residual volatility produces portfolios with significantly higher certainty equivalents than benchmarks for all investors characteristic complementarities produce the benefits for example momentum

1 q fi n g n 2 7 a pr 2 02 1 1 introduction a large literature in finance explores the predictive content of stock characteristics for the cross section of returns most of this literature uses a linear loss function to study the efficacy of characteristics for predicting the cross section of expected returns 1 since standard asset pricing models link expected returns to risk this approach requires modeling risk exposure which is typically accomplished with a factor model to proxy for the stochastic discount factor recent research casts doubt on the interpretation of the results from this approach from both statistical and economic perspectives 2 we examine out of sample cross sectional predictability through the lens of power utility functions this alternative loss function avoids the unnecessary step of developing an empirical proxy for the stochastic discount factor since power utility is a function of all of the moments of the return distribution we extend analysis of characteristics predictive content to higher moments including skewness and kurtosis this is important because stock returns are not normally distributed and characteristic based strategies that generate high alphas may also entail fat tails and or negative skewness making them undesirable to a risk averse investor barroso and santa clara 2015 kadan and liu 2014 3 we use the parsimonious algorithm of brandt santa clara and valkanov 2009 to link mea surable characteristics to future portfolio returns this optimal portfolio approach to modeling characteristics predictive content has several advantages including the ability to optimally com bine multiple characteristics and not having to estimate conditional moments the algorithm also considers the higher order moments of the return distribution conditional on characteristics it has the disadvantage of conditioning and optimizing on sample data subjecting it to estima tion risk which is a first order problem for example a power utility investor with coefficient of relative risk aversion 2 who uses this algorithm to link portfolio weights to momentum log size beta residual volatility and average same month return the optimal characteristic set for this loss function results in a mean 95 confidence interval out of sample certainty equivalent of 42 1 100 0 3 0 per month in sample mean variance optimal portfolios also perform poorly out of sample best and grauer 1991 stress that this is because optimization amplifies estimation errors the models 1 cochrane 2011 stresses the need to evaluate the marginal economic effect of each characteristic lewellen 2015 studies out of sample predictability using fama macbeth regressions freyberger neuhierl and weber 2020 use the lasso to evaluate which characteristics have marginal explanatory power for expected returns 2 linnainmaa and roberts 2018 hou xue and zhang 2017 harvey liu and zhu 2016 and harvey 2017 suggest that the documented predictive power of characteristics is illusory the result of data mining mclean and pontiff 2016 argue that characteristics predictive content vanishes once the relationship is published in our academic literature martin and nagel 2020 argue that agents learning about cross sectional predictive relationships gives rise to evidence of in sample predictability which is not present out of sample 3 non normal return distributions may render linear performance measures such as alpha and the sharpe ratio as well as mean variance optimization inappropriate leland 1999 ferson 2013 and broadie chernov and johannes 2009 goetzmann ingersoll spiegel and welch 2007 harvey and siddique 2000 argue that conditional skewness in stock returns can explain deviations from linear factor pricing models 1 that have been developed to manage estimation risk include constraining weights and constrain ing estimators 4 however demiguel garlappi and uppal 2009 show that in general these economic and statistical tools that have been developed to optimize in the presence of estimation error are dominated by the 1 n rule rather than constrain parameter estimates or portfolio weights we manage estimation risk by decoupling the loss function used to obtain optimal in sample portfolio weights from the investor s utility function we choose the optimal characteristic set in sample loss function and sample construction protocol by comparing the sampling distributions of the out of sample certainty equivalents our empirical design has features in common with machine learning tech niques such as lasso and elastic net freyberger neuhierl and weber 2020 feng giglio and xiu 2020 and gu kelly and xiu 2020 in that we consider two sets of parameters the first set of parameters hyperparameters are the coefficients linking portfolio weights directly to the char acteristics we estimate these coefficients in sample conditional on a characteristic set in sample loss function and sample construction protocol we optimize over these tuning parameters with a second external validation step statistically motivated tools like lasso and the elastic net reward parsimony by imposing penalties on the parameter space 5 since we evaluate optimal portfolio rules out of sample expected utility we reward parsimony by attempting to mitigate overfitting in sample noise from the data generating process which gives the appearance of a pattern in sample which is not observed out of sample our power utility investor with coefficient of relative risk aversion 2 optimally uses a loss function that is more concave than her utility function to obtain portfolio weights this gener ates a portfolio that strictly dominates the benchmarks with expected 95 confidence interval out of sample certainty equivalent of 3 0 2 6 3 5 per month in order to profit from the predictive content of characteristics an investor has to penalize in sample even moments more and reward odd moments less than is natural for her utility function thus our first result is that overfitting is an important component of the estimation risk in this portfolio selection context furthermore the brandt santa clara and valkanov 2009 algorithm suffers from severe overfit ting despite the facts that the algorithm avoids estimating conditional moments and estimates a 4 jagannathan and ma 2003 demonstrate that there is a duality between constraining the weights and shrinking moment estimators in the mean variance optimization context kan and zhou 2007 derive the expected loss function from using sample rather than true moments when returns are normally distributed they show that estimation risk can be diversified by holding a minimum variance portfolio in addition to the estimated tangency portfolio recent bayesian approaches establish a prior using economic theory p stor 2000 and p stor and stambaugh 2000 use asset pricing models to form the prior p stor and mackinlay 2000 impose moment restrictions according to a factor model 5 both the lasso and elastic net model conditional expectations as such there is a mean squared loss function because of this each can be derived using bayesian tools tibshirani 2011 shows that the lasso is ols with a double exponential prior on the parameter vector and elastic net combines this with an independent normal prior as shown in li and lin 2010 2 small number of coefficients 6 estimation risk typically has two components overfitting and temporal instability tempo ral instability may result from learning in the sense of martin and nagel 2020 or structural changes in the economy we examine the extent to which this is a problem by comparing rolling and updating sample formation designs since we document that updating is universally preferred to rolling we infer that structural instability is not the major source of out of sample degradation finally since raising the cost of even moments in terms of odd moments in sample reduces over fitting we can reject the hypothesis that the out of sample performance degradation is the result of the absence of a structural relationship in the underlying data generating process we can also reject the hypothesis that the degradation from in to out of sample performance is entirely due to investors learning about the data generating process in the spirit of martin and nagel since our primitive loss function is an investor s utility function we do not take a stand on the empirical representation of the stochastic discount factor nevertheless it is common to use a linear factor specification to represent the stochastic discount factor kozak nagel and santosh 2018 for example as noted above much of the research on whether characteristics are useful predictors of the cross section of future returns considers the expected return for example from a sorted portfolio conditional on standard pricing factors again because we rely on the utility function itself to rank portfolios we have no interest in alpha per se our optimal portfolio is not the portfolio with the highest out of sample alpha however we are interested in the span of the risk return space of the optimal and benchmark portfolios the standard factors provide a familiar span our power utility investors use characteristics both to achieve some exposure to the fama french carhart ffc factors and to shift away from the market for example the optimal portfolio for the power utility investor with 5 has a market beta of 0 6 and only 3 of the portfolio s variance comes from the market variance this portfolio has a loading of 1 0 on the size factor smb and derives 5 of its variance from this source by contrast these values for the benchmark equally weighted portfolio are 0 5 and 8 respectively similarly the optimal portfolio s loading on the value factor is 2 0 with 17 variance attribution the benchmark s hml exposures are 0 3 and 2 the momentum factor mom accounts for 20 of the optimal portfolio s variance as this portfolio s mom loading is 1 5 the equally weighted benchmark has a momentum loading of 0 1 and it derives less than 1 of its variance from this factor finally this portfolio s alpha is 269 basis points per month and 69 of the portfolio variance lies outside 6 a t sahalia and brandt 2001 p 1299 refer to conditional moment or conditional likelihood estimation as the achilles heel of conditional portfolio choice because although the moments are predictable this predictability is for some moments quite tenuous they argue that by not specifying a likelihood i e the conditional return distribution we avoid introducing additional noise and potential misspecifications through the intermediate but unnecessary estimation of the return distribution 3 the span of the four factors market beta is flat in so that the percent of portfolio variance attributed to the market factor increases in risk aversion by contrast the optimal portfolio s loading on the momentum factor decreases in risk aversion whereas the percent of variance attributed to this factor is constant across the loading on smb and relative importance of this factor monotonically decrease in the optimal portfolio for the power utility investor with 2 has a significantly positive smb loading the optimal portfolio for the investor with 5 has an insignificant smb loading and the loading on smb of the optimal portfolio for the investor with 9 is significantly negative the value factor s appeal increases in risk aversion it accounts for 37 of the portfolio variance of the optimal portfolio of the investor with 9 and 20 of the optimal portfolio of the investor with 2 the four factors account for 32 42 and 54 of optimal portfolio variance as increases from 2 to 5 to 9 figure 1 shows the out of sample return distribution of the optimal characteristic based port folio for the power utility investor with 9 and the value weighted market portfolio the optimal portfolio is tilted toward stocks with positive momentum smaller market capitalizations and lower residual volatility and away from stocks at the other end of the spectrum along these dimensions the optimal portfolio is symmetric whereas the benchmark has a negative skew the optimal portfolio is significantly more leptokurtotic than the market the optimal portfolio s mean return is 176 basis points per month the market s mean return is 106 basis points per month the optimal portfolio s return interquartile range of 4 6 percent per month is significantly less than the benchmark s 5 2 however the optimal portfolio s return standard deviation 4 5 is not significantly different from the benchmark s 4 3 this highlights the fact that the stan dard deviation is not a good measure of scale for a leptokurtotic distribution the mean 95 ile confidence interval of the optimal portfolio s certainty equivalent return to this investor is 62 44 77 basis points per month these statistics for the benchmark are 10 4 15 we conduct comparative statics to isolate the marginal effects of conditioning on a specific characteristic conditional on the other characteristics for a given loss function since we maximize utility functions with varying levels of risk aversion we also evaluate the interaction between the loss function and characteristics marginal effects our first result in this context is consistent with the motivating literature that criticizes the first generation of characteristic based anomalies to wit no single characteristic can be used by all power utility investors to outperform the benchmark 7 the gains from linking portfolio weights to measurable characteristics derive mostly 7 as a matter of exposition we will use the phrase portfolio a outperforms the benchmark to mean that the 2 5 ile of the sampling distribution of portfolio a s certainty equivalent return exceeds the 97 5 ile of the sampling distribution of the market portfolio s certainty equivalent return the market portfolio refers to either the equally weighted portfolio of all stocks or the value weighted portfolio of all sample stocks depending on which the investor prefers 4 from complementarities amongst the characteristics as they relate to the cross section of future returns all power utility investors can outperform the benchmarks using the characteristic triplet momentum log size and residual volatility as risk aversion shrinks average same month return is added to the optimal characteristic set and the most risk tolerant investors we consider also include beta we find that the book to market ratio is never part of an optimal characteristic set because it is redundant in the context of size and residual volatility linking weights to momentum is the only way the portfolio can achieve the desired expo sure to the momentum factor for the more risk tolerant loss functions momentum complements size residual volatility and average same month return to reduce overfitting adding momentum to the remaining optimal characteristics for the power utility investor with 2 reduces the range of the out of sample certainty equivalent s sampling distribution from 10 279 basis points per month to 94 when the curvature of the in sample loss function is fixed at its optimal value alternatively dropping momentum from the optimal characteristic set increases the wedge be tween and the optimal curvature of the in sample loss function whereas the complementary effects of momentum to other characteristics has been noted for example in asness moskowitz and pedersen 2013 we are the first to show that the predictive relationships of size residual volatility and average same month return to future returns are more robust out of sample when conditioned on momentum although stocks with relatively low market capitalizations and resid ual volatility have done well in sample they are only desirable if they also had relatively high returns in months 13 through 2 this result is not evident from linear or mean variance loss functions nor is it evident in sample it appears because of the power utility function s amplifi cation of large negative returns this finding is unexpected and unusual in the sense that adding additional characteristics tends to increase overfitting the book to market ratio and last year s same month return are never part of an optimal characteristic set because the marginal informa tion that they contain in the context of the other characteristics is insufficient to overcome the overfitting that results from increasing the dimensionality of the characteristic space all power utility investors want reduced exposure to stocks that experienced high residual volatility over the preceding five years the power utility investor with 5 can link weights to residual volatility as a singleton to outperform the benchmark this is accomplished by tilting the portfolio away from high and toward low residual volatility stocks the resulting portfolio has a significantly lower standard deviation and interquartile range than the benchmark although the portfolio s expected return is not significantly different from the value weighted benchmark and significantly lower than the equally weighted benchmark this effect in isolation is very different from the marginal effect of conditioning on residual volatility in the context of momentum size and average same month return in that context the desirability of taking long short positions 5 in stocks with extreme values in these other characteristics is contingent on these stocks also having low high residual volatility entirely as a result of these complementarities adding residual volatility to the other characteristics results in a significant increase in the portfolio s expected return unlike momentum s complementarity the salutary interactions between residual volatility and the other characteristics arises in sample the optimal characteristic set for our most risk tolerant investor includes beta with an average coefficient that is positive but insignificantly different from zero when residual volatility is removed from this characteristic set the coefficient on beta becomes significantly negative 8 restricting residual volatility is a necessary condition to derive virtually all of the predictive benefits from the other characteristics for the power utility functions with equal to 5 or 9 dropping the residual volatility from the optimal characteristic set results in a portfolio that fails to statistically dominate the benchmark out of sample the optimal portfolio rules for all three investors have a significant negative average coefficient on log size omitting log size from the characteristic set produces portfolios with a statistically significantly negative smb loading for all loss functions thus all investors use size as a tool to offset the undesirable effects from conditioning on the other characteristics this effect is quite large in certainty equivalent and sharpe ratio terms when size is omitted from the optimal characteristic set the sharpe ratio is statistically significantly smaller than global optimal for all loss functions removing size from the optimal characteristic set significantly lowers the certainty equivalent for the more risk tolerant loss functions linking portfolio weights to average same month return is most attractive for the most risk tolerant loss function this characteristic entails too much estimation risk for the most risk averse investor removing it from the global optimal portfolio rule in the case of power utility with 2 decreases the 2 5 ile value of the portfolio s minimum monthly return from 68 to 86 and significantly decreases the portfolio s leverage expected return sharpe ratio and certainty equivalent removing average same month return significantly increases the portfolio s exposure to the momentum factor and the total exposure to the ffc factors and significantly lowers the portfolio alpha taken together these results are consistent with keloharju linnainmaa and 8 there is a growing literature stemming from ang hodrick xing and zhang 2006 that shows that the highest quintile of stocks sorted by idiosyncratic volatility has a significantly lower expected return than the bottom quintile this seems inconsistent with our result that placing a negative weight on residual volatility as a singleton characteristic generates a portfolio with the same expected return and a lower second moment than the value weighted index at least partial reconciliation of these two results can be gleaned from ang hodrick xing and zhang s table vi p 285 which shows that expected return is not monotone in their idiosyncratic volatility furthermore green hand and zhang 2017 show that the link between idiosyncratic volatility and expected return fades post 2003 while the setting is very different our result that investors want to avoid stocks with high residual volatility and beta is an imperfect proxy for this is similar to liu stambaugh and yuan s 2018 finding that the so called beta anomaly the observation that low beta stocks have a higher expected return than high beta stocks can be explained by the correlation between between beta and idiosyncratic volatility 6 nyberg s 2016 model of seasonal monthly returns aggregating small factors that lie outside the span of the ffc factors we provide a summary of the portfolio selection algorithm and describe the characteristic and return data and our econometric method in section 2 section 3 contains the first set of results on the efficacy of the algorithm and the sources of estimation risk section 4 contains comparative statics results pertaining to how the conditional density differs from the unconditional return density and the role of each characteristic in the conditioning set we conclude in section 5 2 portfolio selection 2 1 algorithm in brandt santa clara and valkanov s 2009 algorithm the vector is estimated to maxi mize a concave loss function over t periods max t 1 t 0 1 rp t 1 1 1 1 t 1 by allowing portfolio weights to depend on observable stock characteristics rp t 1 nt i 1 i t 1 nt xi t ri t 1 2 where xi t is the k vector of zero mean characteristics on firm i measurable at time t i t is the weight of stock i in the value weighted market portfolio at time t and nt is the number of stocks in the sample at time t 9 unlike brandt santa clara and valkanov or demiguel mart n utrera nogales and uppal 2020 we do not identify the parameter used to generate a feasible portfolio strategy in 1 with the relevant statistical loss function instead we consider a statistical loss function alternatively an investor that takes the same form as 1 indexed by the curvature of the statistical loss function which is pre determined and fixed from this perspective is a choice variable a tool to manage estimation risk our empirical design fixes the curvature of the statistical loss function our interest is in out of sample statistical comparisons across portfolios generated by various feasible portfolio rules from the perspective of this nonlinear statistical loss function an eligible portfolio rule consists of a subset of characteristics the in sample period construction protocol and the curva ture of the in sample loss function by definition the optimal in sample portfolio is obtained using all characteristics and by setting equal to whether this is also true out of sample is an empirical question if there is a positive relationship between an optimal portfolio s in sample even order moments and its noise i e higher out of sample even order moments then 9 we condition only on information that is available to investors at the time the portfolios are formed this avoids the overconditioning bias analyzed by boguth carlson fisher and simutin 2011 7 using a more concave loss function than the investor s utility function i e may generate portfolios that are preferred to those obtained by constraining to equal 2 2 data and specifications our sample spans january 1955 through december 2018 our out of sample period comprises the 44 years 1975 2018 we use the following characteristics momentum m the book to market ratio v log size s beta market model residual standard deviation last year s same month return rt 12 and the average same month return over the preceding five years r momentum is the stock s compounded return from month t 13 though t 2 equity market capitalization is the market value of the company s outstanding shares aggregated across all share classes at time t 2 book value is obtained from the compustat database for the most recent fiscal year end between t 6 and t 18 letting b be one plus the ratio of book value to equity market capitalization the book to market ratio is the natural log of b size is equity market capitalization we estimate beta and the residual standard deviation by regressing monthly returns from months t 60 through t 1 on the crsp value weighted index thus the stocks in the january 1960 sample have no missing data from january 1955 through december 1959 we obtain all characteristic and return data from the merged crsp compustat file on wrds to be eligible for inclusion in the sample in month t a stock must have no missing returns in the crsp database for the previous 60 months in order to construct the characteris tics in month t and it must have a positive book value in the compustat database for a fiscal year end between t 6 and t 18 we obtain the us consumer price index from the federal reserve fred 10 and use this to construct a minimum size criterion of 50 million in january 1990 dollars stocks whose market capitalization is less than this inflation adjusted size criterion are excluded from the sample this excludes stocks with market capitalization less than 11 5 million in january 1960 and 99 1 million in december 2018 we next exclude the smallest 10 of stocks that meet all inclusion criteria prior to january 1978 when the first nasdaq stocks enter the sample and the smallest 20 afterwards 11 if the stock return is missing in month t we look to the crsp delisting return if that is missing we substitute 30 for nyse and amex listed stocks and 50 for nasdaq stocks there are 389 exclusively new york stock exchange stocks in the final sample in january 1960 the sample size jumps in august 1967 from 674 to 875 when stocks listed on the american stock exchange are eligible for inclusion in our sample the largest jump in sample size is in 10 we extracted the series cpiaucsl consumer price index for all urban consumers all items 11 green hand and zhang 2017 and hou xue and zhang 2020 highlight the importance of removing microcap stocks from studies of return predictability 8 january 1978 from 1 000 to 1 420 stocks when nasdaq stocks are eligible to enter our sample the maximum number of stocks is 2 291 in april 2006 there are 1 848 stocks in our sample in august 2008 and 1 617 stocks on the last date in our sample december 2018 we normalize and standardize the characteristics so that the mean is zero and the standard deviation is one inspection of 2 shows that optimal portfolio weights will thereby sum to unity for any value of this also means that the characteristics are observationally equivalent to shrinkage values for example let be a stock s ols beta consider a prior weighted beta such as s 5 5 1 the normalized s are identical to the normalized this implicit shrinkage mitigates the usual concerns about outliers in characteristic space so we do not winsorize the characteristics a single observation i t comprises stock i s return in month t ri t as well as the vector of characteristics measurable at month t 1 for stock i i 1 nt because financial firms leverage is potentially different from that of non financial firms we use two alternative treatments of the book to market ratio 12 in the first we treat the book to market ratio the same as other characteristics we standardize it using all stocks and allow it to tilt their weights away from value weighting in the second treatment we exclude financial firms from this characteristic s standardization and set their standardized book to market ratio to zero so that their weights are invariant with respect to this characteristic this alternative treatment means that there are two versions of every characteristic set that includes the book to market ratio we refer to the book to market ratio under the treatment that exempts financial firms as v f excluding the alternative treatment of the book to market ratio there are 127 possible sets of our 7 characteristic variables we consider 48 characteristic sets including each of the six characteristics as a singleton and all seven variables together last year s same month return is only used in conjunction with the five year average same month return 23 of these 48 include the book to market ratio and each of these sets has two alternative treatments which means that we use 71 unique sets of characteristics treatments the base 48 sets maximized over the book to market treatment are reported in table 1 we consider 14 values of 2 13 16 22 the first in sample period comprises the 180 months of january 1960 through december 1974 we use this sample to solve for the vector which we use to construct the out of sample feasible portfolio returns over the next 12 months january through december 1975 we estimate a new vector at the beginning of each out of sample year the out of sample period consists of the 528 months from january 1975 through december 2018 we obtain the vector using all available data through the end of year t 1 for t 1 44 under the updating protocol under the 12 this issue is discussed in barber and lyon 1997 the proportion of financial stocks in our sample changes dramatically over the period from 1 5 in january 1960 to 11 9 in january 1978 to 21 6 in july 1994 and ending at 19 9 in december 2018 9 rolling protocol we use only the previous 180 months at the end of each year so in year 1 the two protocols produce the same vector since the portfolio is defined by there is no restriction on the available set of stocks in each of the out of sample months the last out of sample year is 2018 so the last optimization estimation applied to the 12 months of 2018 out of sample uses 696 months under the updating protocol and the 180 months from 2003 through 2017 under the rolling protocol this means that we optimize expected utility and estimate the vector from each of the 1 988 cases 71 characteristic treatment sets 14 values of 2 protocols 44 times at the end of each in sample year 13 2 3 empirical design the possibility that investors are learning about the data generating process the fact that optimal portfolio selection amplifies estimation error and the possibility of intertemporal changes in the conditional return distribution argue for analyzing optimal portfolios on an out of sample basis we use a bootstrapping out of sample procedure to construct sampling distributions of the functions of interest such as certainty equivalent portfolio loading on factors portfolio skewness etc the data in month t consists of the nt row vector t with elements i t for i 1 nt we stack these t row vectors of varying lengths to form the array this is not a traditional panel since stock i at time t is different from stock i at any other time and as noted the number of columns is different for each row our bootstrap is nonparametric cross sectional resampling motivated by the single period optimization problem with out of sample inference conditional on the time dimension is irrelevant in sample preserving the original time series in all bootstrap resamples allows us to evaluate the effects of structural instability on out of sample portfolios and also maintains the cyclical month of the year and serial dependence patterns inherent in the design of t a bootstrap draw for month t resamples with replacement an nt row vector from t thus each bootstrapped sample consists of the same number of observations in each period as the original sample we preserve the calendar structure of the original data and we maintain the same in sample estimation out of sample evaluation periods as in the data as such t is a cross sectional resample from t for months t 1 t consistency holds under n asymptotics as the number of stocks in each period increases since we can view as a gmm estimator once we have a bootstrap sample we obtain a vector by maximizing 1 at the end of year 15 for a given feasible portfolio rule we use this vector to construct the out of sample portfolio returns in each of the next 12 months we repeat the optimization and out of sample 13 this is a computationally demanding design generating the out of sample bootstrap results for a typical case takes 26 hours of cpu time on a 3 7 ghz xeon processor the computational burden increases exponentially in the number of characteristics and decreases in 10 portfolio return construction at the end of each year 16 59 thus we obtain 44 vectors and 528 monthly feasible portfolio returns from each bootstrap sample we take 10 000 bootstrap samples to construct the sampling distributions for each feasible portfolio rule we use the bootstrap small sample distributions of the certainty equivalent return to select the optimal feasible portfolio rule as econometricians we view each of the bootstrap samples as being equally likely we consider that portfolio a statistically significantly dominates portfolio b if the 2 5 ile value of the sampling distribution of a s certainty equivalent return the lower bound of the 95 statistical confidence interval is greater than the 97 5 ile value of the sampling distribution of b s certainty equivalent return therefore we rank portfolio rules using the 2 5 ile bootstrap value of the out of sample certainty equivalent return thus the optimal portfolio for the loss function indexed by is identified as the feasible portfolio rule that results in the highest 2 5 ile sampling value of out of sample certainty equivalent for that loss function this portfolio is maximally dominant and not dominated by any other portfolio 3 algorithm efficacy noise and estimation risk table 1 shows the sampling distribution of the out of sample certainty equivalent returns on the optimal portfolios under each of the three loss functions conditional on each of the 48 charac teristic sets maximized over the dimensions of sample construction rolling or updating and book to market treatment when relevant the global optimal portfolios i e maximally domi nant over all feasible portfolio rules are emboldened the higher of the two benchmarks equally weighted and value weighted portfolios of sample stocks for each investor are also provided for comparison this table shows that restricting to equal leads to poor out of sample perfor mance that this effect and the optimal characteristic set vary across and that the updating sample construction protocol is preferred to rolling panel a contains results for the 2 loss function where the global optimal characteristic set consists of momentum log size beta average same month return and residual standard devia tion 14 the globally optimal portfolio is achieved with 3 updating sample construction and characteristic set momentum log size beta average same month return and residual volatility this portfolio s mean 95 confidence interval certainty equivalent basis points per month 302 257 352 dominating the equally weighted benchmark with its 95 ile certainty equivalent confidence interval of 101 105 seven of the 48 characteristic sets generate optimal portfolios that are not statistically dominated by the global optimal for all of these seven the optimal is higher than 3 only one that drops beta from the optimal set has four characteristics the 14 as the only statistical loss functions that we consider are power utility functions we will write k loss function to mean power utility function with coefficient of relative risk aversion k we will use the phrases k loss function and k investor interchangeably 11 others all have five six or seven characteristic variables fixing the characteristic set for this loss function the rolling protocol is only preferred to updating when the book to market ratio is in cluded in the characteristic set but there are characteristic sets that include the book to market ratio where updating outperforms rolling panel b shows the optimal portfolios from the perspective of the 5 loss function in this case the global optimal portfolio is achieved with characteristics momentum log size average same month return and residual standard deviation 10 and updating sample construction the mean 95 confidence interval certainty equivalent basis points per month on this portfolio is 152 133 170 this portfolio dominates this loss function s equally weighted benchmark with its 95 ile certainty equivalent confidence interval of 57 62 for this loss function there are nine alternative characteristic sets that generate portfolios that are not statistically dominated by the global optimal portfolio only one of these sets has three characteristics all others have four or more as was the case for the less concave loss function in panel a rolling sample construction is only preferred to updating when the characteristic set includes the book to market ratio panel c reports the results from the perspective of the power utility function with 9 here the global optimal portfolio is achieved with 16 characteristic set momentum log size and residual standard deviation and the updating sample construction the global optimal portfolio s mean 95 confidence interval certainty equivalent basis points per month is 62 44 77 which dominates the value weighted benchmark with its 95 ile certainty equivalent of 4 15 for this loss function 21 of the 48 optimized portfolios 95 certainty equivalent confidence intervals include zero 14 of the 48 portfolios dominate the benchmark and are not statistically dominated by the global optimal portfolio these include two which condition on only a single characteristic either beta or residual volatility for each loss function table 1 panel d isolates the characteristic set containing the book to market ratio which produces the highest 2 5 ile certainty equivalent return for each of the three loss functions this panel shows the effects of treating financial firms differently as well as sample construction in all three cases the choice of sample construction is more important than the treatment of financial stocks and for these characteristic sets updating always outperforms rolling for all three loss functions and for either treatment of financial firms table 2 shows the effect of varying the curvature of the in sample loss function and the in sample construction protocol on out of sample portfolio certainty equivalent returns for the globally optimal characteristic set and another characteristic set for each of the three loss func tions this table shows the importance of using as a tool to mitigate estimation risk it also shows that once reaches a critical level above the loss function s curvature of further increases in have fairly small effects on the resulting portfolio s certainty equivalent returns 12 table 2 panel a shows the effects of changing from 2 12 for the 2 loss function and the optimal characteristic set along with the characteristic set that includes all characteristics except momentum this case provides an example of the well documented problem of the poor out of sample properties of in sample optimal portfolios for the globally optimal characteristic set restricting to equal creates a feasible portfolio rule whose mean certainty equivalent is 42 with 95 confidence interval 100 3 per month 15 increasing holding all else constant shows that much of the estimation risk in this context is the result of overfitting increasing the cost of even moments expressed in terms of odd moments has a dramatic salutary effect fixing there are 142 optimal portfolios across the characteristic sets and sample formation protocol restricting 2 causes 94 of these 142 portfolios 2 5 ile out of sample certainty equivalent return to be 100 overfitting is more severe when the book to market ratio replaces momentum in the char acteristic set for this characteristic set with either updating or rolling must exceed 5 in order for the 2 5 ile of the certainty equivalent s sampling distribution to exceed 100 the maximally dominant portfolio with this characteristic set is obtained with 8 under the up dating protocol and 9 under the rolling protocol both of these portfolios are statistically significantly dominated by the global optimal portfolio for the loss function indexed with 2 table 2 panel b shows the out of sample certainty equivalent returns of optimal portfolios from the perspective of the 5 loss function under the updating protocol this loss function is less sensitive to estimation risk than is the 2 loss function further estimation risk is more severe under the rolling protocol table 1 showed that this investors optimal characteristic set consists of momentum log size average same month return and residual volatility the updating protocol is optimal and the optimal value of is 10 as is the case with the less concave loss function the optimal value of varies with the characteristic set and protocol in general a higher value of is needed to mitigate overfitting under the rolling protocol than under the updating protocol here restricting results in a 2 5 ile certainty equivalent return of 100 in 18 of the 71 cases with the updating protocol and 83 of the 142 cases under both protocols out of sample certainty equivalent 95 ile confidence intervals include zero eight of these 71 portfolios statistically dominate the benchmark and 10 are not statistically dominated by the global optimal portfolio as in table 1 table 2 panel c shows that the optimal portfolio for the power utility loss function with 9 is achieved with feasible portfolio rule comprising the updating protocol 16 and characteristic set momentum log size and residual volatility the 2 5 ile of 15 the certainty equivalent in a single bootstrap draw is 100 when at least one of the 528 monthly returns in the out of sample period is less than 100 13 the out of sample certainty equivalent s sampling distribution is less than zero in 112 of the 142 optimal in sample portfolios generated when 9 imposing this constraint produces eight portfolios that statistically dominate the value weighted index whereas table 1 panel c shows that 15 of the 48 characteristic sets produce portfolios that dominate this benchmark under the updating protocol with unconstrained in general for all three loss functions overfitting is more severe under the rolling protocol than the updating protocol one manifestation of this is that the optimal value of under the former is greater than under the latter for example for the 2 loss function the best rolling portfolio is achieved using all seven characteristics and 6 for the 5 investor the optimal rolling portfolio is achieved with 13 panel c shows that when the characteristic set includes average same month return there is no value of that produces a positive 2 5 ile certainty equivalent for the power utility function with 9 under the rolling protocol this is not the case with the updating protocol table 2 also shows that the effects of overfitting are not monotonic in these effects are more pronounced for the 2 investor and the 9 investor than for the 5 investor in fact under the updating sample formation using characteristics momentum size beta average same month return and residual volatility restricting 5 produces a portfolio that statistically dominates this investor s preferred market benchmark all panels in both tables 1 and 2 highlight the fact that the sampling variations of the certainty equivalent returns are large 16 the global optimal portfolio does not dominate any of the other portfolios in table 2 for both the 5 loss function panel b and the 9 loss function panel c by contrast the global optimal portfolio for the 2 loss function panel a statistically dominates 29 of the other 43 portfolios in this panel these large sampling variances highlight the usefulness of using the 2 5 ile of the out of sample certainty equivalent returns sampling distribution to rank the portfolio rules these three loss functions are representative of others the optimal characteristic set for power utility loss functions with 3 and 4 is the same as for the 2 loss function the 3 loss function is maximized with 5 and the 4 loss function is maximized with 7 similarly the 6 and 7 loss functions have the same optimal characteristic set as the 5 loss function the global out of sample maximum for both of these loss functions is achieved with 12 under the updating protocol both the 8 and 10 loss functions global optimal portfolios are formed using the same characteristic set as the 9 loss function and of 16 all loss functions prefer updating to rolling the out of sample certainty equivalent return s 16 lewellen nagel and shanken 2010 p 185 note the large sampling error relative to mean returns in studies of stock market returns and stress the importance of reporting confidence intervals of functions of interest in order to make sampling issues more transparent 14 95 confidence interval of the optimal portfolio for the power utility function with 10 is 22 5 62 9 basis points per month an investor with these preferences would choose to invest in treasury bills over any equity position as noted in section 2 2 we have bootstrap out of sample results for 1 988 portfolios the 48 optimal portfolios in table 1 have the highest 2 5 ile certainty equivalent across the dimensions of protocol rolling or updating and treatment of the book to market ratio since we con sider 14 integer values of each of these portfolios is the optimal of 56 portfolios for the 23 characteristic sets that include the book to market ratio or 28 for the 25 characteristic sets that do not even though we do not estimate conditional moments overfitting degrades the out of sample performance of the optimal portfolios this is especially severe for the least and most concave loss functions that we consider using a loss function in sample that places a higher penalty on extreme losses than the actual out of sample loss function mitigates the unwelcome effects of noise on portfolio weights 4 how characteristics affect optimal portfolios in this section we evaluate properties of the global optimal portfolio returns and compare these to the benchmarks we also isolate the effect of each characteristic on the sampling dis tributions of various portfolio properties to this end we keep and the protocols fixed at their optimal values for each of the three loss functions indexed by and vary the characteristic set we start with the optimal set for each loss function and remove each characteristic in turn we examine the effect of each characteristic on certainty equivalent returns and unconditional portfolio moments in section 4 1 we assess the complementarities between the characteristics by examining the effects of removing an optimal characteristic on the coefficients that link the remaining characteristics to portfolio weights in section 4 2 in section 4 3 we examine the role of each characteristic in increasing or decreasing portfolio exposure to the fama french carhart factors we conclude this section by summarizing across these dimensions at the characteristic level 4 1 certainty equivalents and unconditional moments table 3 contains sampling distribution properties of certainty equivalent returns uncondi tional portfolio moments and other portfolio properties for benchmarks and optimal portfolios from the perspectives of each of the three loss functions certainty equivalent returns are reported in basis points per month the mean return median return return standard deviation and in terquartile return range are all reported in percentage per month terms the robust measures 15 of skewness s 4 and kurtosis k 3 are recommended by kim and white 2003 s 4 r 5 3 and k 3 r 95 r 05 r 5 r 5 2 63 4 where is the mean portfolio return over the 528 month out of sample period is the return standard deviation r 95 is the mean of the highest 5 of returns r 05 is the mean of the smallest 5 of returns r 5 is the mean of the top half of returns and r 5 is the mean of the bottom half of returns and r 5 is the median out of sample return 17 panel a shows that the 2 loss function strictly prefers the equally weighted portfolio to the value weighted portfolio of sample stocks the 5 loss function is indifferent between the two statistically an investor whose utility function matches the 9 loss function would prefer the value weighted portfolio but is so averse to risk that she would prefer the risk free asset offering an average of 37 basis points per month to the value weighted portfolio whose 95 ile certainty equivalent return confidence interval is only 4 15 basis points per month both benchmarks are more leptokurtic than the normal distribution and both are significantly negatively skewed panel b shows eight portfolios from the 2 loss function s perspective starting with this loss function s global optimal portfolio this portfolio has a 2 5 ile certainty equivalent of 258 basis points per month which statistically dominates the equally weighted benchmark table 1 shows the optimal value of is 3 in this case so we fix 3 to evaluate the comparative statics relating to the characteristics of the other seven portfolios in this panel the 95 ile confidence interval of the 2 loss function s global optimal portfolio s annualized sharpe ratio is 1 07 1 27 which is significantly larger than the equally weighted portfolio s 0 61 0 64 this portfolio s skewness and kurtosis are not significantly different from the bench mark although unlike the benchmark this portfolio is symmetric this portfolio uses leverage to exploit the conditional cross sectional return distribution and to take on significantly more risk than the benchmark dropping momentum from the optimal characteristic set increases the sampling standard deviation of the resulting portfolio rule s out of sample monthly certainty equivalent return from 106 1 to 3 366 8 basis points and the range of its 95 confidence interval from 94 to 10 279 basis points unlike the optimal portfolio this portfolio does not dominate the benchmark despite the fact that none of the moments or properties shown in table 3 differ significantly from the global 17 as per kim and white 2003 in our bootstrap samples s 4 the pearson skewness coefficient is similar to and more reliable than s 3 the bowley skewness coefficient integrated over the tail size similarly k 3 the hogg coefficient is more reliable than k 4 the crow and siddiqui parameter 16 optimal portfolio the asymmetric loss function amplifies the effect that removing momentum has on the sampling distribution of the minimum out of sample return in 2 5 of the 10 000 bootstrap samples the minimum optimum portfolio monthly return is less than 115 and in half of the samples the minimum return is less than 79 by contrast the 2 5 ile minimum return from the global optimal portfolio rule is 68 this confirms the evidence from table 2 that adding momentum to the other four optimal characteristics reduces overfitting this complementary property of momentum can only be appreciated out of sample and with a non linear loss function we will explore this aspect of momentum in more detail as we further analyze the nature of these portfolios in the next subsections dropping log size from the optimal portfolio characteristic set significantly lowers the certainty equivalent return to 170 248 the sharpe ratio to 0 83 1 03 and the portfolio median return from 426 619 to 253 402 basis points per month unlike the globally optimal portfolio this portfolio is significantly more leptokurtic than the benchmark it is also the only portfolio in this table that is positively skewed size is the only characteristic whose marginal addition to the others results in a significant increase in the median out of sample return in contrast with momentum removing log size from the characteristic set has virtually no effect on the resulting optimal portfolio rule s out of sample minimum monthly return on the margin adding residual volatility to the other four optimal conditioning character istics also significantly increases the certainty equivalent return adding this characteristic does not significantly alter any of the first four moments but the sharpe ratio is significantly increased from 0 84 1 01 removing either log size or residual volatility from the optimal characteristic set constrains this risk tolerant 2 loss function s ability to take advantage of the conditional cross section by contrast beta is not as important in constructing the conditional distribution removing beta from the optimal characteristic set does not significantly reduce certainty equiv alent return and unlike the removal of momentum does not generate a portfolio which fails to dominate the benchmark adding average same month return to the other four optimal characteristics significantly increases portfolio leverage from 417 522 to 541 699 while increasing the 2 5 ile of the minimum monthly return from 86 to 68 the marginal effects of average same month return include a significantly higher out of sample portfolio expected return and sharpe ratio it has the largest marginal effect on reducing kurtosis although this effect is not statistically significant adding the book to market ratio to the global optimal characteristic set lowers the 2 5 ile certainty equivalent return from 258 to 247 basis points per month but has no statistically 17 significant effects on the unconditional moments or portfolio leverage 18 the certainty equivalent effect is due to the slightly higher kurtosis and lower minimum return this suggests that the book to market ratio is redundant in the context of the five optimal characteristics substituting the book to market ratio for log size in the context of the other four optimal char acteristics extenuates in sample overfitting as the width of the out of sample certainty equivalent return s 95 confidence interval increases from 94 to 127 basis points this effect is the result of an increase in the sampling variance of the minimum return whose 2 5 ile drops to 86 with this characteristic set table 3 panel c provides basic unconditional out of sample properties of 8 portfolios from the perspective of the 5 loss function as table 1 shows this loss function s optimal out of sample portfolio is formed using the characteristic quartet momentum log size average same month return and residual volatility 10 and the updating protocol accordingly all of the portfolios in panel b are generated using 10 here the optimal portfolio has an out of sample certainty equivalent return of 133 170 basis points per month and sharpe ratio of 1 15 1 32 which are more than twice those of the benchmark this portfolio is much less levered than the 2 loss function s optimal portfolio with an average investment of 244 of equity this portfolio s mean median standard deviation and kurtosis are all significantly higher than the benchmark s however its monthly return interquartile range 557 695 basis points per month is not significantly higher than the benchmark s 590 619 interquartile range is a robust measure of scale that is not distorted by the distributions leptokurtosis for the 5 loss function removing either momentum or average same month return does not significantly lower the certainty equivalent return however because conditioning on momentum in conjunction with the other characteristics reduces overfitting the portfolio formed without momentum does not significantly dominate the benchmark dropping momentum increases the width of the certainty equivalent return s 95 confidence interval from 38 to 90 basis points per month removing average same month return lowers leverage significantly from 123 168 to 96 121 but otherwise has no significant effects on any of the moments or properties reported in table 3 panel c for the 5 loss function removing log size from the optimal characteristic set for the 5 loss function results in a significant drop in certainty equivalent return which is due to a significant drop in the first moment and not the second moment this is also reflected in the resulting portfolio s significantly lower sharpe ratio 0 87 1 03 this suggests that log size is particularly useful in the context of 18 in this context there is virtually no difference between the protocol that exempts financial stocks from condi tioning on the book to market characteristic and the protocol that does not differentiate financial stocks in this way the 95 ile certainty equivalent confidence interval for the former case is 246 2 353 4 using 3 this is consistent with the results shown in table 2 panel d for this loss function in that case we optimize over as well for this set of characteristics the optimal 4 here we use 3 for the purpose of comparative statics 18 momentum and residual volatility at boosting expected return the residual standard deviation is the only characteristic for the 5 loss function whose removal not only significantly lowers the certainty equivalent return to 58 73 basis points per month but also results in a portfolio that does not dominate the benchmarks we will return to the role of residual volatility in this case in section 4 3 adding the book to market ratio to the four optimal characteristics for the 5 loss function does not improve the portfolio in any way adding this characteristic has little effect on the resulting portfolio s out of sample properties relative to the optimal for this loss function the minimum monthly return is lowered manifesting in a 10 basis point per month reduction in the out of sample certainty equivalent return s 2 5 ile sampling value similarly adding beta to the optimal characteristic set does nothing to improve the portfolio and has almost no discernible effect on any of the out of sample properties shown in panel c the 9 loss function s optimal portfolio and related portfolios selected using 16 are reported in table 3 panel d while this loss function prefers the riskless asset to the value weighted portfolio of sample stocks cross sectional predictability is reliable enough to lever 1 77 times conditioning portfolio weights on momentum log size and residual volatility this loss function s optimal portfolio return standard deviation of 433 477 basis points per month is not statistically different from the value weighted portfolio s 427 437 while its expected return 164 189 and median return 170 208 are significantly higher than this benchmark s 102 110 and 121 144 respectively figure 1 shows the densities of these two portfolios which are easy to compare visually because of their similar scales the figure and the summary statistics show that the optimal portfolio is significantly more leptokurtic than the benchmark and has a significantly lower interquartile range 4 33 5 02 than the benchmark 5 04 5 42 together these features suggest that the portfolio is so different from the gaussian distribution that the standard deviation is not a sufficient statistic for the scale that is the optimal portfolio s departures from normality imply that the standard deviation is not a proper measure of the portfolio s riskiness from the perspective of the 9 power utility function figure 1 and table 3 also show that unlike the benchmark the optimal portfolio is not negatively skewed the area in the figure between 10 and 0 monthly return is clearly higher under the benchmark whereas the opposite is true between 2 5 and 10 the difference is especially large between 6 and 8 the 9 loss function s heightened asymmetry precludes the portfolio from attaining the sharpe ratio 0 99 1 14 of the more risk tolerant loss functions the 5 optimal portfolio s sharpe ratio is 1 15 1 32 for this loss function and optimal characteristic set removing momentum does not mitigate overfitting as was the case with the flatter loss functions and higher dimensional optimal charac 19 teristic spaces although dropping momentum does result in a lower 2 5 ile minimum monthly return despite the reduced dimensionality of the parameter space and significantly lower leverage the portfolio mean median and standard deviation are all significantly lower with momentum removed from the optimal set and 16 removing log size from the optimal characteristic triplet for this loss function does not signif icantly lower the certainty equivalent return but leverage and the sharpe ratio are significantly lowered as was the case for the 5 loss function removing residual volatility significantly ad versely affects every desirable attribute of the optimal portfolio in fact for this loss function the optimal portfolio conditional only on momentum and size is dominated by the riskless asset as with the other two loss functions adding the book to market ratio to the optimal charac teristic set adds only estimation risk so that it is redundant in this context a utility function with 9 is too risk averse to benefit from the boost to portfolio expected return provided by the average same month return adding beta and average same month return to the optimal characteristic triplet using 16 amplifies the role of in sample noise the width of the cer tainty equivalent 95 confidence interval increases from 33 to 77 basis points and the resulting portfolio does not dominate the value weighted benchmark or the risk free rate 4 2 coefficients linking portfolio weights to characteristics empirical designs with linear loss functions evaluate a characteristic s efficacy by the statistical significance of the coefficient on that characteristic e g demiguel mart n utrera nogales and uppal 2020 and freyberger neuhierl and weber 2020 this is not the case with our empirical design we are interested in the size and sign of the coefficients from alternative specifications in order to understand how characteristics affect portfolio properties and how they complement or substitute for one another however the statistical significance of a coefficient is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for a characteristic s efficacy this is because we select the optimal model based on out of sample certainty equivalent not in sample properties of table 4 reports the sampling distributions of the coefficients that link portfolio weights to characteristics for the 22 portfolios in table 3 for each feasible portfolio rule there are 44 annual estimates of the vector we average these across the 44 years the table reports the bootstrap properties of these annual averages all three globally optimal portfolios have significantly positive coefficients on momentum and significantly negative coefficients on size and residual volatility the sense in which momentum complements the other characteristics is evident in the comparative statics in this table for all three loss functions removing momentum does not significantly alter any of the coefficients on the remaining characteristics this is consistent with the conclusion from the portfolio comparisons that the complementarity between momentum and the other optimal 20 characteristics arises primarily out of sample with or without momentum the algorithm puts more weight into stocks that are relatively small have relatively low residual volatility and relatively high average same month average return based on the relationships between these variables and future returns in the sample table 3 shows that when momentum is not part of the characteristic set these weights result in a portfolio with such degraded out of sample properties that it is unacceptable to the 2 loss function using 3 however if a stock with higher weighting based on these four characteristics also has relatively low momentum then adding momentum to the characteristic set lowers the weight mitigating the effect of overfitting on portfolio formation similarly without momentum in the characteristic set the algorithm will heavily short relatively large high volatility stocks with low average same month returns allowing the algorithm to complement these weights by also weighting momentum dramatically reduces the adverse effects of noise on the portfolio s performance out of sample supplementing the predictive content of size volatility and same month return with momentum increases these characteristics signal to noise ratio resulting in improved out of sample performance this property of momentum is especially highlighted by the asymmetric loss function in contrast to momentum average same month return is largely independent of the other characteristics both in and out of sample for both the 2 and 5 loss functions removing average same month return from the respective optimal characteristic set does not induce a sig nificant change in any of the other coefficients similarly adding beta and average same month return to the three optimal characteristics for the 9 loss function with 16 panel c has little effect on the other three coefficients beta is in the optimal characteristic set for only the least concave most risk tolerant loss function removing beta from this optimal characteristic set has no significant effects on the remaining coefficients when log size is removed the coefficient on beta becomes strictly positive suggesting that high beta stocks with low residual volatility substitute for small stocks also with low residual volatility table 3 shows that this substitution is less than satisfactory for the 2 loss function as the certainty equivalent of the resulting portfolio is significantly less than the optimal portfolio when residual volatility is removed from the optimal characteristic set for the 2 loss function the coefficient on beta becomes strictly negative there is something about high residual volatility stocks that all investors want to avoid and about low residual volatility stocks that all risk averse investors want heightened exposure to when this characteristic is not available investors use beta as an imperfect proxy table 3 panel b shows that beta is a poor proxy because when it is the only volatility characteristic both the 2 loss function certainty equivalent 21 return and sharpe ratio are significantly lower than the optimal portfolio s which also conditions on residual volatility furthermore whereas removing residual volatility changes the sign of the coefficient on beta removing beta does not significantly affect the coefficient on residual volatility nor does it significantly change the certainty equivalent return panel b of table 4 reports comparative statics on the coefficients for optimal portfolios obtained with 10 starting with the global optimal portfolio from the perspective of the 5 loss function in this case the coefficient on log size is significantly negative with 95 sampling confidence interval 5 2 2 8 when we remove residual volatility from the optimal characteristic set this coefficient becomes insignificant 0 1 0 8 small stocks per se are not attractive to this loss function small stocks with low residual volatility are however since the global optimal portfolio for the loss function indexed with 9 uses three char acteristics table 4 panel c shows sampling distribution properties of the coefficients on these characteristics and related comparative statics when residual volatility is removed from the triplet the sign of the coefficient on size switches significantly from negative 3 4 1 4 to pos itive 0 1 1 2 and the coefficient on momentum switches from significantly positive 0 7 2 0 to insignificantly different from 0 0 1 1 4 table 4 panel d reports the sampling standard deviations and correlations of the estimators for the three optimal portfolios these reflect in sample complementarities and substitutabilities the largest correlations in absolute value are the positive 0 92 and 0 91 correlations between the coefficients on log size and residual volatility in the optimal portfolios for the 5 and 9 loss functions respectively this is consistent with the comparative statics results that show that for these loss functions small stocks are only appealing if they have low residual volatility this effect is dependent on the loss function as the correlation between the coefficients on log size and residual volatility is negative 0 15 in the case of the optimal portfolio for the 2 loss function the substitution effect between beta and residual volatility for the 2 loss function is seen in sample in the 0 85 correlation between the estimators in this case the in sample correlation between size and momentum is negative for all three loss functions and increasing in absolute value in risk aversion the same is true for the correlation between the coefficients on momentum and residual volatility all four coefficients on the globally optimal characteristics shared by the 2 and 5 loss functions drop significantly in absolute value as risk aversion increases this is consistent with the hypothesis that conditioning on these characteristics shifts portfolio exposure to priced factors this issue is explored further in the next subsection where we evaluate the effects of characteristics on factor exposures comparing tables 3 and 4 shows the tension between in sample statistical significance of a 22 characteristic s coefficient and that characteristic s efficacy in the out of sample loss function beta is included in the optimal characteristic set for the 2 loss function however the 95 confidence interval on this coefficient is 1 6 7 5 table 3 panel b shows that adding the book to market ratio to the optimal characteristic set for this loss functions lowers the 2 5 ile certainty equivalent by 10 basis points per month however the 95 confidence interval on this characteristic s coefficient is 1 2 6 8 4 3 relationships between optimal portfolios and fama french carhart factors table 5 panel a decomposes the two benchmark and 22 characteristic based portfolio returns from tables 3 and 4 using a linear projection of the 528 out of sample monthly excess returns on the four fama french carhart factors 19 the table reports the intercept from this regression in basis points per month along with the coefficients on each of the factors the projection decomposes the variance into 11 components with the orthogonal component being the ratio of the residual variance to the total portfolio variance the table only provides covariance terms whose sampling means exceed 5 of total variance so the tabulated component means do not sum to unity panel b contains the correlation standard deviation matrix of the four factors over the sample period the optimal portfolio for the 2 loss function largely lies outside the span of the four factors its mean alpha 95 confidence interval is 269 201 348 basis points per month and 61 75 percent of the excess return variance is not spanned by the factors the portfolio gets less than 10 of its variance from each of the market and size factors this portfolio has significantly more exposure to the value 12 21 and momentum factors 14 28 than the benchmarks dropping momentum from the characteristic set for this loss function changes the momentum factor loading from 1 2 1 8 to 0 5 0 1 the momentum factor s contribution to the port folio variance falls from 14 28 to 0 3 removing the characteristic momentum does not shift exposures into the other three fama french carhart factors the percentage of variance that is orthogonal to these factors increases significantly from 61 75 to 76 86 this portfolio has the highest alpha of all the tabulated portfolios yet table 3 shows that the mean 95 confidence interval of this portfolio s out of sample certainty equivalent return is 11 100 2 8 per month this portfolio with the highest alpha does not statistically dominate the benchmark this is a graphic example of the importance of the loss function in assessing the predictive content of characteristics 19 these four factors are the excess return on the crsp value weighted market index mkt the size factor smb value factor hml and momentum factor mom we obtain these along with the riskfree rate from professor kenneth french s website at dartmouth we use the 528 monthly returns in our out of sample period january 1975 through december 2018 23 section 4 1 and table 3 show that adding log size to the other optimal characteristics for the 2 loss function significantly increases the portfolio s certainty equivalent return expected return and sharpe ratio table 5 shows that this result is not the result of a significant increase in the portfolio s alpha instead it is due to the effects that conditioning on size have on the portfolio s optimal smb exposure when log size is not in the conditioning set the portfolio s out of sample loading on smb is significantly negative 1 5 0 9 this is primarily the result of the negative coefficient on residual volatility for this characteristic set as shown in table 4 panel a adding size to the characteristic set shifts the portfolio s smb loading to significantly positive 0 6 1 4 similarly when portfolio weights are not size dependent hml exposure is statistically insignificant 0 1 0 4 and significantly lower than that of the equally weighted benchmark adding size to the characteristic set raises the hml exposure to 1 6 2 4 furthermore adding log size to the other characteristics significantly decreases the portfolio s exposure to the market factor this loss function uses log size and residual volatility to create a portfolio that is largely market neutral replacing the coefficient log size with the book to market ratio shows that size is uniquely suited to zeroing out the market table 5 shows that the optimal portfolio obtained using the updating protocol 3 and characteristic set momentum book to market ratio beta average same month return and residual volatility has the same hml exposure as the globally optimal portfolio however it inherits one fourth of its out of sample variance from the market significantly more than the global optimal portfolio s 3 furthermore substituting the book to market ratio for size significantly decreases the smb loading from 0 6 1 4 to 1 0 0 3 consistent with the implications of tables 3 and 4 removing beta from the optimal charac teristic set for the 2 loss function has little effect on the relationships between the factors and the out of sample returns of the resulting portfolio similarly adding beta to the optimal char acteristic set for the 5 loss function has little effect on the resulting portfolio s factor regression and variance decompositions removing average same month return significantly lowers the optimal portfolio s alpha for optimal portfolios from both the 2 and 5 loss functions for the 2 loss function the resulting portfolio has significantly higher exposure to the momentum factor than the globally optimal portfolio hml becomes significantly more important for the 5 loss function nevertheless 45 51 percent of the variance of the 5 loss function s optimal portfolio conditioned on the characteristic triplet momentum log size and residual volatility using 10 is not explained by the fama french carhart factors this characteristic triplet is also the optimal set for the 9 loss function using 16 holding this set of characteristics fixed increasing from 10 to 16 shifts the portfolio s exposure away from momentum to the market the momentum factor s 24 loading decreases from 0 51 0 68 to 0 36 0 48 with a corresponding decrease in variance coverage from 22 32 percent to 12 21 percent movement into the market is reflected by the increase in factor loading from 0 45 0 56 to 0 54 0 63 and variance coverage from 13 23 percent to 26 40 percent panel b of table 1 and panel c of table 3 show that the 5 loss function can use residual volatility as a singleton to outperform the benchmark table 4 panel b shows that the average 95 confidence interval coefficient on residual volatility in this case is 2 3 3 1 1 5 table 3 panel c shows that this results in a portfolio whose out of sample expected return is significantly lower than the benchmark since this portfolio has a significantly higher certainty equivalent than the benchmark it follows that its standard deviation and interquartile range are also significantly lower than the benchmark it is also significantly more leptokurtic than the benchmark table 5 provides evidence about how this risk reduction in accomplished this portfolio has a mean 95 confidence interval market beta of 0 76 0 73 0 79 and derives 43 46 49 of its variance from the market it has a significant negative loading on smb and derives roughly one fourth of its variance from this factor the portfolio has a mean loading of 0 4 on hml and derives 10 of its variance from this factor table 5 panel b shows that the market and sml are positively correlated the opposite signed loadings means that the cross effect between these two factor reduces this portfolios variance attributed to the two factors in isolation by 22 similarly the negative correlation between the market and hml coupled with loadings of the same sign reduce the net variance contribution from these two factors by 13 this means that 21 of the portfolio s variance lies outside the span of the ffc factors and the portfolio has an alpha of 29 9 22 4 37 4 basis points per month these results are curious since as we have seen above in section 4 1 removing residual volatility from the optimal characteristic set for the 5 loss function significantly lowers the expected portfolio return from 2 4 2 2 2 7 per cent per month to 1 4 1 4 1 5 per cent per month with little change in the portfolio returns interquartile range table 4 panel c shows the in sample complementarities for residual volatility with 10 removing residual volatility significantly increases the coefficient on log size from 4 0 5 2 2 8 to 0 4 0 2 0 8 the loading on mom the momentum factor drops significantly from 0 6 0 5 0 7 to 0 3 0 2 0 4 the loading on hml drops significantly from 1 1 1 0 1 2 to 0 15 0 2 0 1 as discussed above the ffc factors account for less than 50 of the variance of the optimal portfolio with the market contributing 19 13 25 however restricting the coefficient on residual volatility to 0 results in a portfolio for which the market accounts for 87 83 91 of its variance these complementarities show that it is difficult to isolate residual volatility s effects as it is closely linked to the size and value factors 25 table 4 shows that the coefficient linking log size to portfolio weights is significantly negative 3 4 1 4 in the optimal portfolio rule for the 9 investor this tilts the portfolio toward small stocks and away from large cap stocks yet table 5 shows that this portfolio has a significantly negative smb loading 0 3 0 1 this follows from the fact that conditioning on residual volatility tilts the portfolio toward large cap stocks table 5 shows that when this loss function conditions only on residual volatility and momentum the loading on smb is significantly more negative than for the global optimal portfolio 0 7 0 6 this loss function uses log size to offset the excess exposure to large cap stocks that results from conditioning on residual volatility this significantly increases the portfolio s expected return from 1 2 1 4 to 1 6 1 9 per cent per month alpha from 16 31 to 40 62 basis points per month and sharpe ratio from 0 8 0 9 to 1 0 1 1 beta substitutes for log size as a means of increasing the loading on smb when the latter characteristic is removed from the optimal characteristic set for the 2 loss function optimally the coefficient on beta is statistically insignificantly different from 0 table 4 panel a but when size is removed from the optimal characteristic set this becomes significantly positive 2 9 8 8 the portfolio dramatically increases its exposure to the market portfolio in order to offset the large firm tilt that results from the negative coefficient on residual volatility and despite the tilt toward high beta stocks still has a significant negative loading on smb 1 5 0 9 the efficacy of the characteristic log size stems from its complementarity with residual volatility a phenomenon that is manifest for all three loss functions we highlight consider the use of leverage by the most risk averse loss function despite preferring the riskless asset to the market this loss function s optimal portfolio uses 77 leverage to exploit predictable properties in the cross section green and hollifield 1992 propose an ingenious argument as to why well diversified portfolios may have extreme short positions they point out that if there is a single factor on which all stocks load positively e g in the capm or the pricing kernel then minimizing portfolio variance might be accomplished by finding a diversified portfolio with a zero loading on this factor the 9 loss function provides some insight as to whether this technique to reduce factor exposure appeals to highly risk averse investors this portfolio has significantly more exposure to the market and hml factors than the 2 loss function s optimal portfolio the portfolio does use short positions to reduce exposure to the market factor however the optimal portfolio s expected return 182 169 196 and median return 196 176 217 basis points per month are significantly higher than those of the market 108 103 112 and 135 123 147 respectively this most risk averse loss function finds exposure to the value factor and momentum factors desirable she uses characteristics to create portfolios with exposure to these factors as well as to factors lying outside the span of the fama french carhart factors 26 4 4 characteristic comparative statics summaries 4 4 1 momentum all investors global optimal portfolios have a significant positive coefficient on momentum for the 2 loss function momentum serves to significantly reduce overfitting this beneficial effect decreases in as the tilting toward and dimensionality of the other characteristics diminishes conditioning on momentum is the only tool investors have to gain the desired exposure to the momentum factor which accounts for 15 20 of the return variance of all three loss functions optimal portfolios 4 4 2 log size all optimal portfolio rules have a significant negative coefficient on size adding size to the set of other optimal characteristics significantly increases the sharpe ratio in all three cases certainty equivalent increases significantly for the 2 and 5 loss functions expected return and alpha increase significantly for the 5 and 9 loss functions this effect is muted for the 2 loss function which substitutes high beta for small stocks for the more risk averse loss functions adding size increases the smb and hml loadings and alpha while also shifting the variance outside the span of the ffc factors adding size to the other characteristics increases the coefficient on residual volatility the smb loading absent size is significantly negative so adding size significantly reduces the effect of smb on the portfolio without size in the characteristic set the portfolios of the 5 and 9 loss functions derive 25 of their variance from smb adding size shrinks this to less than 4 4 4 3 residual volatility all optimal portfolio rules have a significant negative coefficient on residual volatility the 5 investor uses residual volatility as a singleton characteristic to tilt toward low residual volatility stocks in order to reduce the value weighted benchmark portfolio s return standard deviation and interquartile range but in the context of the other three optimal characteristics this same investor uses residual volatility to significantly increase portfolio expected return sharpe ratio median return and alpha adding residual volatility to the other three optimal characteristics switches the sign of the coefficient on log size from insignificant to significantly negative it also lowers the percentage of portfolio variance attributable to the market from 87 to 19 increases the percentage of the variance attributable to hml from 1 to 30 and to momentum from 6 to 20 4 4 4 average same month return while average same month return is the only characteristic that can be used as a singleton by our most risk tolerant investor to outperform the benchmark its predictive content is too risky for our most risk averse loss functions to exploit adding it to the other four characteristics 27 for the 2 loss function has no effect on any of their coefficients the resulting portfolio is less leptokurtotic and has a higher minimum monthly return while neither of these effects is statistically significant each is amplified by the loss function this suggests that as is the case with momentum conditioning on average same month return mitigates some of the estimation risk inherent in the other characteristics this manifests in the reduction in the width of the certainty equivalent s 95 confidence interval from 116 to 94 basis points which when scaled by the mean certainty equivalent is a drop from 63 to 32 4 4 5 beta beta only enters the optimal characteristic set for our most risk tolerant loss functions and has a minimal effect in the context of the other optimal characteristics its complementarity to log size and residual volatility are important in assessing their marginal contributions removing log size from the optimal characteristic changes the average coefficient on beta from insignificant to significantly positive as the portfolio uses beta as an imperfect inverse proxy for size similarly removing residual volatility from the optimal characteristic changes the average coefficient on beta to significantly negative 4 4 6 book to market ratio all of our optimal portfolios load significantly on the value factor hml without conditioning on the book to market ratio which has been historically associated with value although the book to market ratio has a positive statistically significant coefficient when added to the optimal characteristic set for the 2 and 9 loss functions its marginal effects on the resulting portfolios are very small the 2 5 ile sampling value of the minimum monthly return is lowered as is certainty equivalent s 2 5 ile sampling value the desired positioning of the portfolio relative to the ffc factors is achieved by residual volatility and size in combination conditional on that information the book to market ratio is redundant and adding it to optimal characteristic set increases sampling variation reflected in the width of out of sample certainty equivalent s 95 confidence interval 5 conclusions an important goal of linking portfolio weights to characteristics avoiding the intermediate step of estimating conditional moments is mitigation of estimation risk which is known to plague optimal portfolio selection however we show that the benefits from conditioning on observable characteristics are largely lost to overfitting when an agent obtains portfolio weights by maxi mizing her own utility function on sample data ratcheting up risk aversion for the purpose of in sample utility maximization mitigates overfitting and allows a risk averse investor to profit from the predictive information contained in the characteristic and return data these out of sample 28 utility gains derive from shifting into stocks that are jointly small have low residual volatility and positive momentum the gains derive from complementarities across these characteristics as no one characteristic can be used to produce utility gains by all loss functions the fama french carhart factors do not span the space of priced factors in the market the most risk tolerant investor s optimal portfolio alpha is over 200 basis points per month but this is not a free lunch increasing risk aversion shifts the portfolio toward the four factors significantly decreasing alpha nevertheless less than one fourth of the variance of the optimal portfolio for a power utility investor with relative risk aversion of five is driven by the market furthermore more than half of this portfolio s return variance is unrelated to the four fama french carhart factors whereas we have filtered our results through different loss functions and considered out of sample returns our empirical approach is not normative consistent with computer intensive machine learning methods we use the out of sample period to select the optimal feasible portfolio rule and evaluate performance because we are interested in comparing non nested alternatives fraught with estimation risk this is a design for inference not prescription this is also reflected in our empirical design which ignores trading costs and assumes away short selling constraints although in the presence of either static optimization is not appropriate how can these results be reconciled with equilibrium several of the assumptions underlying our design are likely violated first we consider only a static optimization problem this is of course optimal if the investment opportunity set does not change over time that seems unlikely second we optimize only within the set of publicly traded equities this can understate the appeal of the market depending on how it correlates with other forms of wealth for example real estate and human capital another way to interpret this is that the market portfolio or even a convex combination of the fama french carhart factors is a poor proxy for the stochastic discount factor third the bootstrap ties the subjective probability measure to historical data if marginal investors imaginations outpace their experiences that could be a problem 29 references a t sahalia yacine and michael w brandt 2001 variable selection for portfolio choice journal of finance 56 1297 1351 ang andrew robert j hodrick yuhang xing and
