wu 2 panpan wen 1 weihua liu 1 1 applied science college harbin university of science technology harbin 150080 china 2 corresponding author schlumberger westerngeco geosolution houston texas usa abstract in this paper we consider the impact of time delay by media on the control of the disease we set up a class of sism epidemic model with the time delay and the cumulative density of awareness caused by media the sufficient condition of global asymptotic stability of disease free equilibrium is approved we get the global stability of the epidemic equilibrium and the existence conditions of hopf bifurcation numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the analytical results finally we analysis the influence of parameters on the control of infectious disease by combining the data of h 1 n 1 by shortening the time of media lag increasing transmission rate of media and the implementation rate of the media project the spread of disease will be controlled effectively keywords sism model time delay hopf bifurcation numerical simulation 1 introduction if a new infectious disease occurs infected numbers death numbers infection disease symptoms and other related information is reported by media it makes people strengthen the prevention awareness choose consciously preventive measures and minimize the risk of contact with infection individuals these precautions reduce the chances of being infected so the media plays a important role in preventing epidemic 1 the propaganda of disease mainly affects the effective contact rate of susceptible individuals it can increase the awareness of prevention and reduce the spread of disease by adjusting the media propaganda 2 3 4 in recent years due to the awareness being cumulated by media it appears that the corresponding research results about controlling disease effectively 5 6 under the influence of media information the susceptible individuals are divided into two groups of aware and unaware and the susceptible individuals in the unaware group will eventually all convert into susceptible individuals who have awareness the cumulative density of awareness is introduced into the model as an independent dynamic variable sism model is established and the existence conditions of equilibrium are given the global stability of equilibrium is proved by structuring liapunov function 7 19 for the sism model with the delay of latency the results show that the stability changes and the model appears hopf bifurcation with the change of the parameters of latency considering that a small part of recovered individuals are still unawared susceptible individuals while the rest restore to awareness susceptible individuals the global stability of equilibrium and the existence conditions of hopf bifurcation are studied by establishing sism model from the normal form theory we infer the direction of hopf bifurcation the stability and the approximate expression of the periodic solution 9 when the disease occurs the media does not report immediately and it is 2 reported after a certain time in addition we do not take timely measures to prevent disease after media reports the infectious disease under the situation of different delay parameters the global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium was proved by structuring liapunov function in sism model on the basis of existing results the influence of latency and information time lag is researched we establishes double delay sism infectious disease model and the stability of equilibrium and the existence conditions of hopf bifurcation are studied in this paper 2 the model there exists a latent period for the infectious disease when the media reports the disease at time t exposed individuals show symptoms after latent period in the meantime we take into account of the case that the media do not report the information about the disease at time t and it is reported after a time delay of h in this paper we obtain the double delay s 1 is 2 m infectious

there exists hopf bifurcation around the endemic equilibrium e of the model 3 proof 1 according to the roots existence conditions of cubic polynomial when 3 0 q 0 or 0 and 0 1 2 iq i then equation 14 has no positive root by the cook theorem 13 we know that all characteristic roots of equation 12 have negative real parts that is to say e is asymptotically stable conclusion 1 holds 2 suppose that h h i h is positive root of equation 12 when 0 1 q and 2 q are non positive at the same time 2 f has a positive root 2 and 2 0 f it follows that equation 14 exists positive roots 2 1 2 k k m in 0 let 0 satisfy 0 0 1 1 0 0 h h according to the continuous dependence of characteristic root h to h and the choice of 0 1 h it follows that the critical value 0 1 h is h which makes the characteristic root firstly through to imaginary axis according to the cook lemma 13 for each 0 1 0 h h it follows that all the roots of equation 12 have strict negative real part so e is asymptotically stable when 0 1 h h then the characteristic roots of equation 12 exist positive real part the endemic equilibrium e of model 3 is unstable conclusion 2 holds 3 if condition 2 holds now differentiating equation 12 with

includes gene fragments of three kinds of influenza virus of human avian swine flu it spreads mainly through body fluids droplets and air latent period is generally 1 to 7 days 15 with the spread of the disease the number of patients also increases it brings significant impact on the quality of life and the development of social economy in the course of the global fight against h 1 n 1 there are a lot of research about the dissemination and the development trend of the disease lin etc analyze the trend of international flu in statistical method and assess the impact of pandemic on the country but they do not come up with effective strategies to control the disease 16 based on the research results of infectious disease model this paper quantitatively analyzes the influence of the parameters such as the rate of consciousness transfer and the implementation rate of the media project on the development trend of the disease and puts forward the prevention and control strategies 5 2 the determine of parameters based on data from the china statistical yearbook birth rate death rate and natural growth rate in 2012 we know that the rate of constant input and natural death is 0 007 c 17 the value of v references 18 for other parameter values we let 17 0 6 p 0 0 5 0 0 7 0 3 the awareness transfer rate the media project implementation rate 0 the time delay and h are mainly considered for controlling infectious diseases 5 3 numerical simulations with the change of awareness transfer rate media project implementation rate latent period and the time delay of media the development trend of disease will change the trend of disease is analyzes in different parameter values by numerical simulations the parameter values are shown table 1 table 1 the influence of parameter h on

individuals the results of numerical simulations show that we must increase media propaganda after the disease outbreaks let the public know the way of disease transmission route and make prevention measures as soon as possible so it may effectively control the infectious disease 5 4 the strategies of control disease for different diseases the comprehensive control strategies are implemented it reduces disease incidence 1 after the outbreak of the disease the processing time of disease information is not too long the disease is reported to raise the consciousness of prevention as soon as possible it makes that the relevant departments of medical takes timely measures to control the disease and the time of disease stabilization is shortened 2 the media propaganda increases and the rate of consciousness transfer and the implementation rate of the media project also increase it makes the proportion of infected individuals reduce significantly and the disease is controlled effectively 3 because there exists a latent period for the disease it is difficult to control the disease so people should try to avoid going to public places and reduce the chance of being infected 4 it can effectively prevent the spread of the disease by isolating infection individuals and it can improve the cure rate of the patients by processing medical assistance and increasing the vaccination rate
