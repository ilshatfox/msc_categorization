resilient urban housing markets shocks vs fundamentals amine ouazad september 2020 abstract in the face of a pandemic urban protests and an affordability crisis is the desirability of dense urban settings at a turning point assessing cities long term trends remains challenging the first part of this chapter describes the short run dynamics of the housing market in 2020 evidence from prices and price to rent ratios suggests expectations of resilience zip level evi dence suggests a short run trend towards suburbanization and some impacts of urban protests on house prices the second part of the chapter analyzes the long run dynamics of urban growth between 1970 and 2010 it analyzes what in such urban growth is explained by short run shocks as opposed to fundamentals such as education industrial specialization industrial diversifica tion urban segregation and housing supply elasticity this chapter s original results as well as a large established body of literature suggest that fundamentals are the key drivers of growth the chapter illustrates this finding with two case studies the new york city housing market after september 11 2001 and the san francisco bay area in the aftermath of the 1989 loma prieta earthquake both areas rebounded strongly after these shocks suggesting the resilience of the urban metropolis i would like to thank the johns hopkins coronavirus

urban areas such population is concentrated on a small share of the world s landmass between 0 45 liu he zhou wu 2014 and 1 5 european commission depending on the estimates the spatial concentration of location choices can be explained by agglomeration economies a key mechanism that enables the description of the spatial distribution of location choices and economic activity using the tools of general equilibrium the basic mechanisms of agglomeration economies were described as early as in marshall s 1890 principles of economics and are the essential ingredient in spatial models including fujita thisse 1996 and behrens robert nicoud 2015 agglomeration enables the sharing of common resources the matching with potential employers buyers sellers partners it also enables learning and social interactions dense urban living makes workers more productive puga 2010 agglomeration economics underpin the emergence and growth of cities duranton puga 2004 efforts to estimate the magnitude of agglomeration economies are described in rosenthal strange 2004 melo graham noland 2009 and combes gobillon 2015 recent events have raised concerns that the benefits of agglomeration may be declining affecting the desirability of urban living perhaps even triggering an exodus from cities the high density of urban setting suggests that over long periods of time the benefits of agglomeration have typically outstripped the costs of living in urban settings these include traffic congestion duranton turner 2011 potential health hazards moore gould keary 2003 1 labor poaching combes duranton 2006 at least two shocks have affected urban areas in 2020 the covid 19 pandemic and urban protests anecdotal evidence statements by public officials as well as descriptive statistics suggest a positive correlation between urban density and the number of confirmed covid 19 cases per capita 2 in addition urban protests focusing on racial justice have taken place in 43 of the 917 metropolitan 1 the causal impact of urbanization on health is ambiguous for instance singh siahpush 2014 displays a life expectancy that is 2 7 year longer in urban areas vs rural areas of the united states urbanization can lead to worse health outcomes in urban slums riley ko unger reis while statistical correlations also suggest that urbanization is a necessary condition for growth there are examples of urbanization without growth e g in sub saharan africa and in south asia annez and buckley chapter 1 in spence annez buckley 2009 chauvin glaeser ma tobio 2017 2 table 1 presents regressions suggesting a statistically significant positive correlation between county population density and confirmed cases per capita 2 areas in may 2020 3 thus a key question is whether the multiple short run shocks to urban housing markets are likely to cause a long term decline in metropolitan population growth will advances in information technology coupled with the challenges of living in dense neighborhoods lead to a decline of urban living with a population living farther away from the densest cities the answer is ultimately an empirical question that can be informed by the analysis of i the nature of recent short run shocks to local housing demand and ii the importance of short run shocks versus long run fundamentals for the growth of metropolitan areas this chapter presents an analysis of the short run shocks to the housing market in 2020 using zip level housing data as the long term prospects of u s urban housing markets cannot yet be assessed the chapter turns to the past to inform the future the chapter performs an analysis of the long term 1970 2010 growth trends of 306 metropolitan areas it then presents two zip level case studies of the long term resilience of new york city s housing market after september 11 2001 and of the long term resilience of the san francisco bay area after the 1989 loma prieta earthquake by combining micro data on covid 19 infections geocoded urban protests with census demo graphics house prices inventories and rents the chapter documents the large magnitude of the series of shocks that affected u s housing markets in 2020 prices inventories rents all experi enced large movements yet despite such large shocks the dynamic of prices is consistent with the market s expectations of resilience there is also evidence that within metropolitan areas housing demand is increasing faster in less dense neighborhoods and in neighborhoods farther away from the center of the metropolitan area this is consistent with at least in the short run households adaptation to changing conditions by demanding housing in locations farther away from the impact of the short run shocks the second part of the chapter uses longitudinal time series of census tracts with consistent 2010 boundaries to estimate the impact of fundamentals and shocks on the population growth in 306 metropolitan areas 4 results suggest no statistically significant impact of shocks such as hurricanes and urban protests this may be surprising given the experience of new orleans in 2018 population was 16 lower than its pre hurricane 2005 level yet in other metropolitan areas billion dollar 3 this statistic uses geocoded protest location data and zillow s definition of metropolitan area boundaries these data are described in section 2 4 4 recent data includes information on more than 900 metropolitan areas the 1970 2010 longitudinal data of the neighborhood change database allows an analysis of 306 metropolitan areas 3 events such as hurricane harvey and hurricane sandy had no discernible impact on metropolitan population levels beyond differences in the hydrology and topography of new orleans houston and new york a set of economic differences in fundamentals may explain the divergent long term paths in response to short run shocks this may also explain why collins margo 2007 finds a long run impact of the 1967 detroit riots a short run shock on long run population growth and on property values detroit s population peaked in 1950 17 years before the riots glaeser 2011 argues that detroit s industrial mono culture may have hindered innovation hence the shock of the riots may have been correlated with or driven by economic fundamentals such as detroit s relatively lower industrial diversification and high level of racial segregation this chapter s description of the importance of shocks vs fundamentals does not establish that shocks do not affect metropolitan population growth boustan kahn rhode yanguas 2020 describes impacts on outmigration and income but rather that fundamentals may outweigh their impacts the chapter also presents a case study of the resilience of local housing markets in the aftermath of september 11 2001 in new york there is evidence of a short run reversal of the gradient between price appreciation and distance to the central business district during the september december 2001 period yet the gradient returns to its prior long term negative slope whereby price appre ciation is higher in the cbd there is no impact of the event on house price appreciation from 2002 onward similar findings emerge in this chapter s second case study the impact of the 1989 loma prieta earthquake on san francisco s housing markets while there are visible population outflows in the 1990 census in areas affected by the earthquake there is no long term difference in population trends across areas with different earthquake risks large corporate headquarters have sprung up in those areas at risk of earthquakes overall the metro level and the neighborhood level evidence are consistent with the resilience of urban housing markets whereby fundamentals drive metropolitan growth rather than short run shocks this chapter s findings are consistent with prior literature davis weinstein 2002 documents the evolution of japanese cities from the stone age to the modern era with a specific focus on the impacts of world war ii bombing on the growth of japanese cities they document a strong recovery in the years immediately after such an unprecedented shock to city population brakman garretsen schramm 2004 documents that this is also true of german cities strategically bombed during world war ii the impact on city growth is only temporary davis weinstein 2002 emphasizes 4 the importance of locational fundamentals this chapter emphasizes the importance of fundamentals such as education industrial composition and urban segregation in other words it can be argued that while resources such as coal or proximity to major streams may have determined the emergence of cities it is their education levels their diverse economic activity and the opportunity to interact and learn that is the modern foundation of urban living this chapter s results also suggest that housing supply elasticity is a positive driver of metropoli tan population growth limited housing supply elasticity in some metropolitan areas might be driving recent population outflows from california to more affordable housing markets in texas arizona nevada and other states zabel 2012 finds that the cost of housing is a driver of labor mobility across metropolitan areas during the 1990 2006 period limited housing supply elastic ity may be hindering recovery after shocks koster van ommeren rietveld 2012 argues that planning policies may have hindered the rebuilding of bombed areas in rotterdam after world war ii finally this chapter s findings are also consistent with prior work on pandemics and housing markets francke korevaar 2020 finds only short run impacts on house prices and rents of the 17 th century plague in amsterdam of 19 th century cholera in paris these effects are short lived as they do not last more than a year these results are also consistent with the canadian experience of the sars pandemic on april 23 2003 the world health organization issued a travel advisory for toronto recommending postponing all but essential travel there is however no evidence of impacts of sars infections on the growth of toronto s housing markets prices and transaction volumes in 2003 and beyond the teranet index displays a 5 year on year house price increase throughout 2003 price increases remain strong in subsequent years reaching 7 9 between october 2007 and may 2008 this may be due to the relatively limited number of sars cases in toronto this is also consistent with a model in which house prices capitalize the entire flow of future rents and thus are resilient in the face of short run shocks such as pandemics overall the results described in this chapter imply that metropolitan areas may be on an equilibrium path and that shocks are short run deviation from this single dynamic equilibrium davis weinstein 2008 finds no evidence of multiple equilibria in cities dynamics using data for 114 japanese cities this paper finds that industrial composition and the size of the manufacturing sector are unchanged after large shocks to city population and employment this resilience may be 5 due to the quality of institutions of high income countries kahn 2005 this chapter proceeds as follows section 2 describes the ongoing shocks experienced by u s housing markets since march 2020 and their impact on market dynamics section 3 describes long run 1970 2010 evidence of the drivers of metropolitan population growth as well as new evidence of the impact of september 11 and the 1989 loma prieta earthquake on neighborhood dynamics section 4 provides a cautious forecast of urban resilience in the face of the 2020 shocks 2 the u s housing market in 2020 resilience and adaptation 2 1 short run aggregate dynamics insights from prices and rents time series of house prices listings and rents suggests that 2020 is a major shock to real estate dynamics it also provides evidence about the market s expectation of resilience we describe the dynamics using zillow s time series data and interpret them using standard principles of real estate while rents reveal the current flow value of housing prices capitalize current and future flow values this section uses metro level time series in the next section we focus on smaller more granular local housing market dynamics at the 5 digit zip code level figure 1 a presents the year on year change in the zillow house value index zhvi between january 31 2015 and july 3 2020 this price index is built using a repeat sales methodology similar to case shiller 1987 the bold line is for the united states the dashed line for the tristate metropolitan area of new york and the dotted line for the metropolitan area of los angeles all three series suggest that after a deceleration of prices in 2019 transaction prices experienced an accelerating growth from january till july 2020 perhaps surprisingly such deceleration did not soften during the covid 19 pandemic but rather price growth accelerated reaching year on year levels above 4 in july the dynamic of rents is rather different and reconciling this apparently contradictory dynamics provides new insights figure 1 b displays the year on year change in the zillow observed rent index zori which measures changes in asking rents over a sample of properties by measuring rents for the same units this index is akin to a repeat rent index hence this index is built with a similar method as the house value index the figure suggests that rent growth not only decelerated but rents decreased in the metro area of new york dropping by more than 2 year on year in 6 july 2020 in the united states overall and in los angeles rents are close to declining figure 1 d presents the metro level distribution of average year on year changes during the march to august 2020 period for the 100 largest metropolitan areas it suggests that overall prices have increased faster than rents with a significant number of metropolitan areas experiencing rent declines or stagnation while there is only one metro area with price declines listings experience the largest drop figure 1 c suggests that listings started decreasing signif icantly at the beginning of the pandemic dropping year on year by 20 in the u s and by up to 40 in los angeles with a rebound in june july 2020 this presents a first hypothesis for the seem ingly paradoxical increase in prices a first hypothesis is selection bias houses that do not transact during a given time period do not contribute to a repeat sales index by construction and houses in the lower part of the price distribution are more likely to experience no transaction during down turns ouazad ranci re 2019 while houses that do transact experience price increases houses whose value is declining might not contribute to the set of observations of the price index hence part of the index s fluctuations may simply be due to dynamic selection gatzlaff haurin 1997 this possibility nevertheless is unlikely to explain the observed price and rent trends first both the price index and the rent index are vulnerable to this selection bias second one econometric ap proach to correcting for such selection bias the inverse time weighting approach ambrose coulson yoshida 2015 does not typically yield significant differences in the price index three alternative mechanisms rationalize the evolution of the housing market s trends the simplest way to express them is using the gordon shapiro 1956 approach such approach capitalizes expected rents using a constant discount factor and a constant expected growth rate of rents rents are net of maintenance costs property taxes and potential credit costs formally r p r g 1 where r is the current net rent p the current value of the asset r the required capital yield and g the growth rate of net rents this can be written as p r r g suggesting that prices may increase even as current rents fall whenever i the expected growth rate of rents increases ii the rate of return r declines iii net rents increase relative to gross rents due for instance to a decline in credit costs 7 figure 2 a shows that as expected the increase in prices and the decline of rents implies a declining rent to price ratio which is the outcome of at least these three potential mechanisms first the de cline in the 30 year fixed rate mortgage average figure 2 b lowers interest costs and pushes prices up at given rents the impact of cheap mortgage credit on house prices has been documented adelino schoar severino 2012 favara imbs 2015 justiniano primiceri tambalotti 2019 second the decline in the aaa corporate bond yield figure 2 c suggests that prices are increasing in a search for yields the required rate of return on capital can be approximated by such a safe bond yield plus a risk premium third the increase in prices and the decline of the price to rent ratio is consistent with expectations of rent growth while current rents may be low buyers are arguably expecting substantial future rent growth figure 2 d plots expectations of price and rent growth using the time series of fannie mae s national housing survey while expectations of rent growth g fall sharply in june 2020 they rebound and become positive again in july 2020 suggesting that housing market participants expect a short lived trough in rents rather than a prolonged slowdown 2 2 covid 19 cases greater frictions declining rents resilient prices the global covid 19 pandemic affected housing markets throughout the world yet the spatial distribution of confirmed cases and deaths is uneven the pandemic emerged in the united states as a significant measurable phenomenon in the first half of march 2020 while daily confirmed cases were below 70 a day on march 5 th they grew to a peak of more than 77 000 cases a day on july 16 th 2020 for a total of 5 9 million cases as of august 29 2020 5 on the same day canada had reached a total confirmed number of cases of more than 129 000 cases figure 3 a presents the spatial distribution of cases per capita across zillow s metropolitan hous ing markets the colors corresponds to quantiles of cases per capita this map suggests that covid 19 infections reached most housing markets with an average number of confirmed cases per 100 residents of between no confirmed case three metros of utah cedar city price and saint george and a maximum of 9 cases per 100 residents alta indiana as expected the largest metropolitan areas host the largest number of total confirmed cases with 543 000 cases in new york 282 476 in los angeles with the exception of riverside california the largest numbers of 5 this chapter was written in september 2020 8 cases are all in the 10 largest metropolitan areas by population table 1 performs a county level regression of confirmed cases per capita on a range of variables from the american community survey density is measured by the ratio of county population on the county s area in squared kilometers the log density is a more relevant measure than density itself as the regression is less driven by extreme observations the regression includes state fixed effects results are unaffected by the inclusion of state fixed effects the table displays an economically and statistically significant correlation between county log density and confirmed cases per capita regardless of the inclusion of additional controls we match such cases by population to shifts in inventories to document a substantial and significant correlation between the decline in real estate inventories and the number of cases per population this is depicted in figure 3 b the vertical axis is the average year on year percentage change in inventories over the march to august 2020 period the horizontal axis is the number of cases per population where the total number of confirmed cases is from the johns hopkins coronavirus research center and county level population aggregated to zillow s metro areas is from the 2018 american community survey 6 the pandemic affected the ability of homeowners to sell and of buyers to acquire a property likely increasing search frictions and leading to inefficiencies there is no metropolitan area with cases per population above the median and inventory growth above the median charleston south carolina with more than 3 cases per 100 7 experienced a 4 decline in inventories new orleans with 3 1 cases per 100 experienced a 3 7 decline in inventories in contrast some of the largest increases in inventories happened in metropolitan areas with low case numbers san francisco with only 1 1 cases per 100 experienced a 3 2 increase in listings there is no detectable metro level correlation between house price dynamics and the number of confirmed cases suggesting that the impact of the pandemic may be more likely to stem from the economic consequences of the pandemic rather than through the avoidance of infection probabilities figure 3 c plots the average monthly change in prices for each of the largest 100 metros against the number of cases per population it suggests that prices are largely unrelated to confirmed cases 6 while 2020 county level population numbers have not yet been released a similar correlation would arguably hold with updated data 7 confirmed cases are also reported as cases per million using this alternative scaling does not affect this chapter s analysis 9 with a large variance of up to 20 percentage points in house price changes for metros with low infection numbers and no significant difference between metros with low infection numbers and metros with high infection numbers evidence may come from the correlation between rents and infection numbers figure 3 d plots the average change in rents against the number of cases per population metro areas with large num bers of cases per population experienced lower than average rent growth in contrast metropolitan areas with low case counts per population experienced some of the largest rent growth levels these three pieces of evidence on inventories prices rents suggest a substantial short run impact of the pandemic on the flow utility of housing in metro areas affected by the pandemic but a long run expectation of resilience whereby the pandemic does not significantly affect buyers expectations of the value of living in metro areas with large cases per population 2 3 evidence of short run suburbanization while house prices are overall on the rise there may be within city shifts in demand towards neighborhoods that are less dense and farther away from the central business district which are arguably less exposed to the pandemic anecdotal evidence 8 suggests that cities may become more resilient when households increase their demand for less dense areas where the propensity for infections is perceived to be lower 9 to perform this analysis we turn to neighborhood level evidence from the new york city metro area figure 4 presents the example of two neighborhoods with two extreme density levels the upper panel a presents the upper east side with a population density of 53 029 residents per squared kilometer as of 2018 it features condominium towers and other high density urban developments such density is higher than the average density of the densest cities in the world this stands in con trast with new york s great neck peninsula lower panel b on the northern side of long island with a population density 18 times lower of 2 968 residents per squared kilometer while commut ing time from great neck to downtown manhattan is less than half an hour this neighborhood has more than 20 parks across 9 villages and features verdant residential areas 10 8 new yorkers look to suburbs and beyond other city dwellers may be next national public radio july 8 2020 new yorkers are fleeing to the suburbs the demand is insane new york times august 30 2020 9 while many other factors than density explains the variance of cases across locations there is a significant and positive correlation between population density and cases per capita as displayed in table 1 10 marcelle sussman fischer the new york times july 2016 10 https www nytimes com 2016 07 31 realestate on the great neck peninsula a rich blend of many cultures html we test whether neighborhoods such as the upper east side have seen a decline in demand relative to neighborhoods such as great neck during the period of march to august 2020 we do so by regressing shifts in prices on 1 the distance to the population weighted center of the metropolitan area 2 population density as the ratio of the 2018 acs population over the area of the zip code tabulation area in squared kilometers the results are presented in the scatter plot of figure 5 and in table 2 these scatter plots and the regression table suggest a reversal in patterns of housing demand during the pandemic indeed the correlation between house price appreciation and density is positive in the three months of march may 2019 that is also true for other periods outside the pandemic the correlation between house price appreciation and urban density is also positive in the same time period of 2019 one year before the pandemic yet these two correlations turn negative and significant at 1 in the three months of march to may 2020 as the supply of housing moves slowly in the short run fluctuations in house prices between march and august are likely a good measure of the shift in the demand for housing units vacating less desirable locations and searching for housing in more desirable locations hence correlations between the characteristics of neighborhoods and shifts in transaction prices are likely a relevant proxy for shifts in tastes these results suggest that in the short run household demand has adapted by shifting to less dense and more peripheral neighborhoods 2 4 local housing markets and the may 2020 urban protests the year 2020 saw a second series of shocks affecting urban housing markets urban protests in response to alleged actions by the police started in may 2020 and quickly spread to a substantial number of u s metropolitan housing markets figure 6 a presents the geographic location of the may 2020 protests with more than 100 participants according to the geocoded crowdsourcing of the wikimedia foundation 11 the spatial extent of these protests exceeds those of the 1968 protests as documented by stanford university s susan olzak in her collection of ethnic collective action in contemporary united states this suggests that the 2020 urban protests may be the largest protests in u s history whether protests lead to positive reforms that improve the desirability of 11 other potential sources of recent geocoded data include the crowd counting consortium further literature may focus on factiva s news archive as an alternative source of information on protests 11 urban living or whether protests lower the quality of life in urban metros is an empirical question collins margo 2007 uses decennial census data between 1950 and 1980 to describe the long term impact of the 1960 s riots on property values they suggest that riots led to a decline of property values and in particular to a decline in black owned property values with no rebound in the 1970 s the perhaps most salient example of such decline is the city of detroit in this context glaeser gyourko 2005 argues that shocks may lead to a long decline in metropolitan areas as the supply curve of housing is l shaped a decline in housing demand may lead to a decline in house prices down to the marginal cost of housing leading to larger vacancy levels attracting lower productivity workers and lowering the benefits of agglomeration economies figures 6 b and 6 c present a correlational analysis of urban protests and house prices in the metropolitan area of los angeles figures 6 b presents evidence that george floyd protests extended from the northern neighborhood of san fernando to the southern neighborhoods of laguna niguel figure 6 c compares house price appreciation in zip codes where a protest happened red line to house price appreciation in zip codes where a protest did not occur black while the hypothesis that the appreciation rates are parallel cannot be rejected statistically prior to may 2020 the appreciation rate declines and crosses the appreciation rate of zip codes where a protest did not occur hence while on average across the united states house price increases suggest expectations of urban resilience there is local evidence of some expectations of decline in specific neighborhoods affected by the urban protests this may be driven by the shift of demand towards neighborhoods less exposed to risk the endogeneity of riots may cast doubt on the causal interpretation of such event studies that rely on a pre post analysis of the impact of riots on urban growth and decline dipasquale glaeser 1998 finds support for a beckerian mechanism in which protests are the outcome of a comparison between the opportunity cost of time and the potential cost of punishment and consistent with evidence by esteban ray 2011 the paper finds that ethnic diversity matters in the case of los angeles in may 2020 evidence suggests significant differences in the demographics of zips with urban protests and without urban protests 12 mean protest zips other zips difference s e t frac african american 0 054 0 084 0 029 0 019 1 56 frac hispanic 0 372 0 406 0 034 0 041 0 82 frac asian 0 219 0 186 0 032 0 025

012 1 70 in particular this table suggests that protests occurred in neighborhoods that had significantly higher household income lower shares of african americans and hispanics higher shares of owner occupied housing lower poverty rates and lower fractions of households with no health coverage in the future longer time series combined with sound identification strategies may allow for a causal analysis of the 2020 protests on urban housing markets 3 housing markets in the long run the role of shocks vs initial conditions the previous section described the short run response of u s housing markets to the pandemic and the urban protests the long run prospect is yet unknown the past can nevertheless inform our perception of future trends this section describes the long run evolution of metropolitan areas between 1970 and 2010 using longitudinal census tract data it sheds light on the drivers of the rise and decline of cities are cities that experience large short run shocks rebounding or are the typical impacts permanent shifts in population levels prior literature gabaix 1999 ioannides overman 2003 has described the relative stability of city size distributions which follow zipf s law where the log population is a linear relationship to the log rank of the metropolitan area yet within such distribution metro areas rise and fall understanding which observable characteristics drive such rise and fall is the focus of the first section 3 1 while metropolitan area rankings tend to be stable the desirability of specific neighborhoods within metropolitan areas changes more dramatically over time this is the focus of subsections 3 2 and 3 3 we present two case studies the new york housing market in the aftermath of september 11 and the dynamic of san francisco s 13 neighborhoods after the 1989 loma prieta earthquake 3 1 explaining metropolitan growth in the long run the relative ranking of metropolitan areas is stable over time data from the neighborhood change database suggests that the correlation between a metropolitan area s population rank in 1970 and its rank in 2010 is 0 8 implying that the best predictor of a city s future is its past rankings are also stable in other dimensions than population kerr robert nicoud 2020 shows that 1975 1980 annual patent count is a strong predictor of 2013 2018 patent count yet some metropolitan areas experience rapid population shifts the dallas fort worth arlington went from being the 11 th most populus metro to the number 4 rank the atlanta metropolitan area went from the 19 th to the 9 th rank joining the 10 largest metro areas in contrast pittsburgh went down 13 notches from the 9 th most populous metro to the 22 nd most populous as the steel industry declined two of the largest relative growth levels were observed in las vegas going from the 102 nd to the 31 st largest and the austin round rock metropolitan area jumping 58 spots to the 35 th rank the largest relative decline is that of johnstown pennsylvania going from the 150 th to the 249 th spot with a 50 6 decline in population this metropolitan area experienced three major floods the most recent in 1977 this major flood could be a candidate for a causal driver of the city s decline another competing explanation for this decline is johnstown s specialization in the steel industry with steel mill plants in the heart of its downtown hence for johnstown as for other metropolitan areas a key question is whether shocks here floods or fundamentals here industrial composition explain their rise and fall we use data from a range of sources to estimate the correlation between urban growth and i natural disasters ii urban protests iii industrial composition iv education levels v urban segregation and vi housing supply elasticity each of these hypothesis has received support in the literature the analysis of this chapter is not comprehensive yet provides an overview of the potential drivers of urban growth and decline the shocks hypothesis natural disasters 14 natural disasters may cause either temporary or permanent shifts in population levels we use data from noaa s significant storm events which provides damages and fatalities at the county level since january 1950 we count the number of billion dollar storms for each county in the 1970 2010 period the metropolitan area with the largest number of such storms is the new orleans metairie la cbsa with 12 billion dollar storms then comes the gulfport biloxi pascagoula ms cbsa with 6 such storms and the houston the woodlands sugar land tx cbsa with also 6 such storms the new orleans cbsa is also the metropolitan area with the largest amount of billion dollar damages we consider three variables explaining metropolitan growth the number of events the total property damages and whether there was any event urban protests we test the urban protest hypothesis using data collected by susan olzak on ethnic collective action in the united states olzak west 1995 the list of events was compiled from the new york times index and from microfilms of new york times articles we focus on protests occuring between 1970 and the last date of the file 1992 the data reports the number of protestors the involvement of police damage to property the presence of non residents and other features for each metropolitan area we match the now deprecated standard metropolitan area smsa geographies to the 2010 core based statistical area which is the most recent definition of metropolitan boundaries the fundamentals hypothesis we compare the impact of shocks to the impact of the following fundamentals education industrial composition segregation and housing supply elasticity in each case we describe the associated literature and the data used industrial composition initial industrial composition may matter for long term metropolitan growth through a number of channels first specialization in industries with strong global demand for their products may lead to a greater demand for labor in the metropolitan area this is the intuition of bartik 1991 and blanchard katz 1992 12 second the diversity of industries initially present in a metropolitan 12 for a discussion of this empirical approach see goldsmith pinkham sorkin swift 2018 15 area may foster the growth of a variety of industries that depend on an economic fabric of different suppliers and different customers this is the industrial diversification hypothesis perhaps most saliently popularized by jane jacobs in the death and life of great american cities typically small manufacturers must draw on many and varied supplies and skills outside themselves they must serve a narrow market at the point where a market exists and they must be sensitive to quick changes in this market without cities they would simply not exist city diversity itself permits and stimulates more diversity chapter 7 the generators of diversity we estimate the correlation between industrial composition either specialization or diversifica tion using the earliest wave of publicly available data from the county business patterns these data provide establishment numbers for each standard industrial classification sic 2 digit code we aggregate such county level data to the boundaries of 2010 core based statistical areas the same boundaries as those of the neighborhood change database this allows for measuring the growth of metropolitan areas to test the specialization hypothesis we use 2 digit sic codes leading to the following categories agriculture fishing and forestry metal mining and oil con struction manufacturing transportation and utilities finance insurance and real estate non classifiable retail the measure of industrial specialization is the herfindahl index hhi which is equal to the sum of the squares of the 2 digit sic industry establishment shares hhim k sharek 2 2 where m is the metropolitan area k is the 2 digit sic code and sharek is the proportion of establishments in industry k we use the share of establishments as this variable is well filled in the us census bureau s county business patterns given the large asymmetry and the fat tails of the hhi measure results of the linear regression are more robust when regressing on four indicator variables for the four quantiles of hhi from least specialized q 1 to most specialized q 4 education in moretti 2012 the author describes the diverging paths of menlo park and visalia ca and suggests that menlo park experienced significantly stronger growth thanks to its higher share of educated residents in the rise of the skilled city glaeser saiz 2003 describes the higher growth of more educated cities even after controlling for a range of covariates this chapter s measure of 16 education is the fraction of college graduates in 1970 according to the 1970 census count 4 pa provided by the national historical geographic information system at the university of minnesota segregation and inequality our third measure of metropolitan area fundamentals is urban segregation a number of papers suggest that urban racial segregation affects welfare li campbell fernandez 2013 argues that urban segregation has effects on metropolitan economic growth beyond its effects on minorities and poor residents thus urban segregation may be a concern for both distributional and efficiency rea sons card rothstein 2007 suggests that neighborhood segregation has a consistently negative impact on the sat scores of black students watson carlino ellen 2006 describes the negative correlation between income segregation and metropolitan population growth we build a measure of black white urban segregation in 1970 at the beginning of our time period the dissimilarity index measures the difference between the distribution of black residents across neighborhoods and the distribution of white residents across the same set of neighborhoods we use 1970 census tract demographics the dissimilarity index is a popular measure of segregation notably developed in duncan duncan 1955 and used in cutler glaeser vigdor 1999 the dissimilarity measure used in this paper is dm 1 2 j wm j wm bm j bm 3 where m is one of the 306 metropolitan areas j indexes neighborhoods wm j resp bm j is the number of white resp black residents in neighborhood j wm resp bm the number of white resp black residents in metropolitan area m results using other pairs of races and ethnicities are available from the author notable examples of segregated metropolitan areas include the chicago naperville elgin il in wi metropolitan area 0 90 oklahoma city ok 0 89 los angeles long beach anaheim ca 0 89 and detroit warren dearborn 0 88 alternative segregation indices such as the exposure or the normalized exposure indices cutler et al 1999 ouazad ranci re 2016 provide different rankings yet these three indices are strongly correlated housing supply elasticity our final hypothesis is that constraints on housing supply stemming either from geographic or regu 17 latory constraints are a barrier to the development of metropolitan areas they indeed constrain the growth of the housing stock mayer somerville 2000 glaeser gyourko saks 2006 saks 2008 and make housing more expensive for productive workers whose productivity gains are transferred to the owners of land there is a variety of available housing supply elasticity measures starting with saiz 2010 we use recent metro level elasticity measures from gorback keys 2020 yet using saiz s 2010 measures does not affect the regression estimates we control for an indicator variable for a missing elasticity measure as housing supply elasticity is typically not available for smallest metropolitan areas other possible fundamentals other fundamentals could be included in a further analysis innovations measured by the number of patents per capita kerr robert nicoud 2020 market access and transportation costs redding 2010 public transportation infrastructure kahn 2007 gonzalez navarro turner 2018 the proximity to deepwater ports brooks gendron carrier rua 2018 the flow of credit due to the structure of the banking sector in the metropolitan area clarke 2004 ouazad ranci re 2016 and other fundamentals estimation results shocks and fundamentals results of the analysis are presented in table 4 the first columns present the covariates separately education industrial composition segregation elasticity shocks and the last columns performs the regression with all previous covariates simultaneously in all 11 regressions the dependent variable is the change in the metropolitan area population rank between 1970 and 2010 a first notable fact is the strong correlation of black white urban segregation education and industrial specialization with a metropolitan area s relative growth more segregated areas grow less than other more integrated areas metropolitan areas with larger shares of college educated residents grow significantly more areas with less diverse industrial composition an hhi in the 4 th quartile tend to grow significantly less consistent with jane jacobs hypothesis regressions indicate that it is the concentration in one or a few industries that predicts urban decline rather than the specialization in manufacturing 18 notably none of the shocks urban protests and storms have a statistically significant impact at 5 there is no significance whether one looks at the number of riots whether there is any riot the dollar amount of property damages due to storms the number of storms or whether there is any storm in some cases the sign is as expected a larger number of riots with damages to property has a negative impact on a metropolitan area s population growth yet the impacts are not significant the last column includes all of the previous covariates simultaneously interestingly both ur ban segregation and industrial specialization remain strongly significant at 1 again consistent with the central tenets of jane jacobs the death and life of great american cities shocks re main non significant perhaps notable is the significance of the housing supply elasticity measure when controlling for other fundamentals metropolitan areas with higher housing supply elasticities experience significantly higher growth significant at 5 3 2 the resilience of the new york city housing market after september 11 while city rankings by population size are stable the ranking of neighborhoods tends to fluctuate substantially over time evidence from the neighborhood change database suggests that the correlation between a tract s ranking in 1970 and the same population ranking in 2010 is only 0 2 this suggests that cities may be resilient when urban residents adapt their location and housing consumption by using the variety of amenities housing stocks and access to jobs to respond to shocks september 11 2001 presents a case study for the impact of a terrorist event on the desirability of living in dense urban spaces the event had dramatic consequences on the welfare of central new york city residents galea ahern resnick kilpatrick bucuvalas gold vlahov 2002 suggests that adults experienced symptoms consistent with post traumatic stress disorder ptsd with a prevalence of ptsd up to 20 for those living south of canal street near the world trade center in a set of respondents with an oversampling of children new the world trade center hoven duarte lucas wu mandell goodwin cohen balaban woodruff bin et al 2005 finds that 29 of children experienced anxiety disorders this may have impacts on the new york housing market in isra l elster zussman zussman 2017 using hedonic and repeat sales approaches to show that attacks led to a 6 to 7 decline in house prices and rents they also find that these effects are perisistent beyond the 2000 2012 19 period and suggest this is consistent with a perception of a continued threat bram haughwout orr 2004 suggests that the september 11 events caused a sharp contraction of business activity in the long run eisinger 2004 claims that few lasting effects on city life are evident and suggests that city dynamics are affected by long term forces rather than even very significant short term ones we provide quantitative neighborhood level evidence of the dynamics of housing markets during and in the aftermath of september 11 using 5 digit zip code price data since 1996 we are thus able to estimate pre existing trends the impact of the events during the september to december 2001 period and during the post 2001 period we can also test whether these events affected the desirability of central city living in new york evidence suggests a strong rebound of price growth in the october to december 2002 period compared to the october to december 2001 period monthly year on year price appreciation for the new york msa as a whole and for the central new york city zip codes suggests that prices increased significantly a year after september 11 2001 there is no immediate discernible negative impact of september 11 on price appreciation in the new york msa as a whole suggesting that even shocks that a have strong negative impact on residents welfare have not been capitalized into long run house prices yet figure 7 does present evidence that september 11 temporarily shifted demand away from central new york city and to the suburbs panel a shows that price appreciation is up to twice stronger in zip codes close to the central business district than for neighborhoods in the 10 to 60 kilometer range 6 to 37 miles from the central business district this relationship is almost flipped in september and october 2001 wher price appreciation is larger in zip codes farther away from the central business district cbd than close to it yet panel d suggests this is only a temporary phenomenon as price appreciation is again decreasing with the distance to the cbd between 2002 and 2020 this evidence suggests that while september 2001 did affect the demand for central new york residential housing these effects did not last beyond 2001 at least in terms of price appreciation for residential units in the densest parts of new york the dramatic shock of september 2001 also affected the demand for central city residential housing in other cities abadie dermisi 2008 suggests that 9 11 increased chicago s residents perception of the probability of terrorist attacks they show that vacancy rates increased in the 20 vicinity of the sears tower the aon center and the hancock center this section s result do not however provide evidence of long run impacts of these events on residential housing markets 3 3 rebuilding san francisco after the 1989 loma prieta earthquake the loma prieta earthquake was an earthquake of magnitude 6 9 on the richter scale that shook the san francisco bay area on october 17 1989 according to the california department of conservation it caused 63 fatalities 3 737 injuries and 6 billion dollars in property damage its epicenter was only 32 5 miles from cupertino and 48 miles from menlo park both of which were and still are major centers of technological innovation a study published in the years following the earthquake murdoch singh thayer 1993 analyzed the dynamic of house prices in six counties that were affected the study used all residential home sales between january 1988 and november 1990 results controlling for a substantial range of covariates suggested that the disaster caused an overall decline in property values as well as a gradient between house prices and measures of earthquake risk such as soil type and seismic zone designation yet a key question is whether these price declines persisted and whether local amenities were affected in the long run in this last section we perform an analysis of the long run impact of the earthquake on neighborhood level population flows using data from the california conservation department 13 on earthquake risk and data from the neighborhood change database in a first step we estimate the liquefaction risk for each block of the san jose san francisco oakland combined statistical area according to the geological survey liquefaction takes place when loosely packed water logged sediments at or near the ground surface lose their strength in response to strong ground shaking 14 liquefaction risk is a predictor of damage to structures cubrinovski bray taylor giorgini bradley wotherspoon zupan 2011 towhata yasuda yoshida motohashi sato arai 2016 as the nature of the soil leads to greater impacts on land at a given earthquake magnitude in a second step we matched such block level liquefaction data with the neighborhood change database s tract level population levels we compute the share of a tract s area that is in the liquefaction area prices are harder to analyze over such a long period nevertheless population level 13 cgs information warehouse regulatory maps 14 what is liquefaction natural hazards u s geological survey 21 are an indicator of the immediate impact of the earthquake on living conditions and long term population changes are an indicator of the quality of neighborhood amenities owens iii rossi hansberg sarte 2020 argues that neighborhood population levels can decline below a threshold that yields large amounts of vacancies table 4 indeed suggests that population declined significantly in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake census data was collected in 1990 only a few months after the earthquake that shook the metropolitan area in october 1989 the first column of the upper panel of the table suggests that population declined 12 between 1980 and 1990 in tracts that are entirely in the liquefaction area this is significant at 1 the first column of the lower panel provides the regression where the dependent variable is the tract s population rank a tract within the liquefaction area lost 35 9 ranks on average in 1990 columns 2 and 3 nevertheless suggest that the effect of the earthquake is relatively short lived tracts in the liquefaction area experience no different population growth in the two decades following the devastating earthquake there is no straightforward evidence that the earthquake is a major long term driver of population dynamics this is also clear in figure 8 which focuses on mountain view while a substantial share of mountain view is in the liquefaction area including the headquarters of google at 1600 amphithe atre parkway there is no discernible impact of the liquefaction area on population dynamics in other words a regression discontinuity design at the boundary of such area would likely yield no significant impact this suggests that the 1989 loma prieta earthquake with damages estimated to 6 billion dollars stover coffman 1993 had only a minor impact on the san francisco bay area s long term population trend 4 conclusion the total magnitude and the length of both the covid 19 pandemic and the urban protests are at the time of writing this chapter yet unknown the past can nevertheless provide a sliver of hope for the future the evidence and the literature presented in this chapter suggest that over the span of four decades metropolitan areas are remarkably resilient to shocks fundamentals rather than short run shocks drive long run population trends such resilience of urban housing markets suggests that the benefits of agglomeration play a key role in residents welfare sharing matching 22 and learning are key motives that explain the desirability of urban living these benefits have over the long run arguably been greater than the negative externalities of agglomeration high levels of education a diversified industrial composition and racially integrated neighborhoods are keys to the resilience of metropolitan areas references abadie a dermisi s 2008 is terrorism eroding agglomeration economies in central business
