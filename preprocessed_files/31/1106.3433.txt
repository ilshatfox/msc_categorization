sultan qaboos university p o box 36 al khoud 123 muscat sultanate of oman snub 24 cell is the unique uniform chiral polytope in four dimensions consisting of 24 icosahedral and 120 tetrahedral cells the vertices of the 4 dimensional semi regular polytope snub 24 cell and its symmetry group w d 4 c 2 s 3 of order 576 are obtained from the quaternionic representation of the coxeter weyl group w d 4 the symmetry group is an extension of the proper subgroup of the coxeter weyl group w d 4 by the permutation symmetry of the coxeter dynkin diagram d 4 the 96 vertices of the snub 24 cell are obtained as the orbit of the group when it acts on the vector 1 or on the vector 1 in the dynkin basis with 1 5 2 and 1 5 2 the two different sets represent the mirror images of the snub 24 cell when two mirror images are combined it leads to a quasi regular 4 d polytope invariant under the coxeter weyl group w f 4 each vertex of the new polytope is shared by one cube and three truncated octahedra dual of the snub 24 cell is also constructed relevance of these structures to the coxeter groups w h 4 and w e 8 has been pointed out 1 introduction the o 4 symmetry or rather its proper subgroup so 4 su 2 su 2 has many applications in physics a few examples are in order one example is from the atomic physics the accidental degeneracy of the energy levels of the hydrogen atom can be explained in terms of the symmetry of the hamiltonian under the so 4 invariance another one is from the condensed matter physics the superfluid phases of the 3 he are described by the broken symmetry so 4 u 1 1 other applications can be given from the nuclear physics where the symmetry su 2 s su 2 i explains the spin isospin invariance of the nuclear interactions in particle physics the same symmetry has been used as a chiral symmetry to explain the low masses of the up down quarks moreover it is also suggested as the extension of the electroweak theory the above applications are all based on the lie group structure of the o 4 symmetry we do not yet have any evidence as to how any finite subgroup of the group o 4 has been observed in any physical phenomena on the other hand the finite subgroups of the group o 3 derived from the coxeter groups w a 3 w b 3 and electronic mail kocam squ edu om electronic mail nazife squ edu om electronic mail muataz squ edu om 1 http arxiv org abs 1106 3433 v 2 2 w h 3 corresponding respectively to the tetrahedral octahedral and icosahedral symmetries have many applications in physics chemistry and biology the orbits of these groups represent the platonic solids archimedean solids as well as the catalan solids they are all useful in the classifications of the molecules as well as the viral structures the extensions of the polyhedral symmetries to the 4 dimensions can be made by invoking the coxeter groups 2 w a 4 w b 4 w f 4 andw h 4 which constitute the finite subgroups of the group o 4 3 however not all semi regular polytopes can be obtained from the above groups the snub 24 cell is one of the example that requires the proper subgroup of the coxeter group w d 4 this follows from an observation that the snub icosahedron chiral icosahedron can be derived as the orbit of the proper subgroup of the tetrahedral group 4 namely the orbit w a 3 c 2 1 it is well known that the chiral polyhedra in particular snub cube and snub dodecahedron are used to describe certain molecular symmetries 5 this paper studies the construction of the snub 24 cell by expressing its symmetry group w d 4 c 2 s 3 as well as the vertices of the snub 24 cell in terms of quaternions orbits of the coxeter weyl group w d 4 are important because they are used to describe the irreducible representations of the so 8 lie group which is the little group of the superstring theories in 10 dimensions 6 section 2 deals with the construction of the group elements from the coxeter dynkin diagram d 4 in section 3 we construct the chiral icosahedron using the proper subgroup of the tetrahedral group w a 3 section 4 shows the explicit construction of the vertices of two snub 24 cells mirror images of each other and explains their cell structures the dual polytope of the snub 24 cell has also been constructed we point out that the union of two mirror images of these polytopes leads to a quasi regular polytope with 192 vertices consisting of the cells of cubes and truncated octahedra section 5 briefs our method and give some suggestions for the use of snub 24 cell 2 construction of the group w d 4 c 2 s 3 in terms of quaternions let q q 0 qiei i 1 2 3 be a real quaternion with its conjugate defined by q q 0 qiei where the quaternionic imaginary units satisfy the relation eiej ij ijkek i j k 1 2 3 2 1 here ij and ijk are the kronecker and levi civita symbols and summation over the repeated indices is implicit quaternions generate the four dimensional euclidean space where the quaternionic scalar product is defined as p q 1 2 pq qp 2 2 the group of unit quaternions is isomorphic to su 2 which is the double cover of the proper rotation group so 3 the quaternionic units can be represented 3 by the pauli matrices as ej i j j 1 2 3 in an earlier paper 7 we have constructed the group w d 4 using the quaternionic representations of the simple roots of the diagram d 4 here we employ slightly different representation of the group w d 4 in terms of quaternions the coxeter dynkin diagram of d 4 is shown in fig 1 fig 1 the coxeter dynkin diagram of d 4 the simple roots are chosen in terms of quaternions as follows 1 e 2 e 3 2 e 1 e 3 3 e 2 e 3 4 1 e 1 2 3 the cartan matrix c ij i j and its inverse c 1 ij i j with i j ij can be written as c 2 1 0 0 1 2 1 1 0 1 2 0 0 1 0 2 c 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 4 2 2 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 4 the weight vectors can be expressed in terms of quaternions as follows 1 1 2 1 e 1 e 2 e 3 2 1 e 1 3 1 2 1 e 1 e 2 e 3 4 1 2 5 for an arbitrary quaternionic root i the reflection generator ri can be writ ten as the quaternion multiplication ri 12 i i simply denoted by ri i 2 i 2 as an abstract group element the coxeter group w d 4 generated by the reflection generators ri i 1 2 3 4 is a group of order 192 and can be compactly written as w d 4 v 0 v 0 v v v v v 1 v 1 v 2 v 2 v 3 v 3 2 6 where the sets of quaternions are defined by v 0 1 e 1 e 2 e 3 v 12 1 e 1 e 2 e 3 even number of sign v 1 2 1 e 1 e 2 e 3 v 1 1 2 1 e 1 1 2 e 2 e 3 odd number of sign v 2 1 2 1 e 2 1 2 e 3 e 1 v 3 1 2 1 e 3 1 2 e 1 e 2 2 7 4 the proper rotation subgroup w d 4 c 2 v 0 v 0 v v v v is simply generated by the set of rotation generators rirj i j 1 2 3 4 this is a group of order 96 with the permutation symmetry s 3 of the simple roots dynkin diagram symmetry of the diagram d 4 the proper rotation subgroup can be ex tended to the larger group w d 4 c 2 s 3 of order 576 where the notation indicates the semi direct product the generators of the symmetric group s 3 can be taken as 1 2 1 e 1 e 2 e 3 12 1 e 1 e 2 e 3 v v and e 2 e 2 then the group can be represented as w d 4 c 2 s 3 p q p q where p q t 2 8 here t v 0 v v represents the quaternionic elements of the binary tetrahedral group of order 24 which also stands for the vertices of the polytope 24 cell we will use a compact notation w d 4 c 2 s 3 t t t t 2 9 for the designation of the group in 2 8 if we had constructed the extension of the group w d 4 by the symmetric group s 3 we would obtain the group 7 8 w d 4 s 3 w f 4 t t t t t t t t 2 10 where t v 1 v 2 v 3 we recall that the set t represents the vertices of the 24 cell rotated with respect to the set t it is clear that the group in 2 9 is one of the maximal subgroups of the group w f 4 and also it is a maximal subgroup of the coxeter group 9 w h 4 i i i i here i t s represents the set of 120 quaternions representing the binary icosahedral group as we will show later that the set s with 96 vertices represents the snub 24 cell 3 chiral icosahedron constructed as the orbit of the w a 3 c 2 let the coxeter dynkin diagrama 3 be represented by the quaternionic simple roots as shown in fig 2 fig 2 the coxeter diagram a 3 with quaternionic simple roots the cartan matrix of the coxeter diagram a 3 and its inverse matrix are given respectively by the matrices 5 c 2 1 0 1 2 1 0 1 2 c 1 1 4 3 2 1 2 4 2 1 2 3 3 1 the basis vectors of the coxeter dynkin diagram a 3 in the dual space are given by 1 1 2 e 1 e 2 e 3 2 e 3 3 1 2 e 1 e 2 e 3 3 2 using the simple roots of a 3 one can generate the coxeter group as w a 3 t t t t s 4 td 3 3 isomorphic to the tetrahedral group of order 24 the proper rotational tetrahedral group generated by the rotation generators rirj i j 1 2 3 is given by the set of elements w a 3 c 2 t t of order 12 it has been proven that 4 one can generate the vertices of an icosahedron as the orbit of the groupw a 3 c 2 t t acting on the either vector i 1 2 3 1 or ii 1 2 3 1 where 1 5 2 and 1 5 2 as defined in the abstract one can prove that these vectors are the mirror images of each other by substituting the quaternionic expressions in 3 1 the vectors read i e 2 e 3 and 2 ii e 2 e 3 applying the group elements of the group w a 3 c 2 t t on these vectors one can generate two sets of icosahedra w a 3 c 2 i e 1 e 2 e 2 e 3 e 3 e 1 w a 3 c 2 2 ii e 1 e 2 e 2 e 3 e 3 e 1 3 4 the icosahedron represented by the first set of vertices is shown in fig 3 fig 3 the icosahedron obtained from the orbit t t 1 let us observe that each set is also invariant under the change of signs of the vectors this additional symmetry can be achieved by the operators 1 1 and 6 fig 4 the quasi regular polyhedron represented by the vertices of 3 4 1 1 these generators extend the group to the group t t t t of order 48 therefore each set is invariant under the above group of order 48 one notes that the dynkin diagram symmetry of the diagram a 3 namely 1 2 3 3 which leads to the transformation of quaternionic units e 1 e 1 e 2 e 2 and e 3 e 3 this can be achieved by the operator e 1 e 1 the proper tetrahedral group can be extended by this generator to the group w a 3 c 2 c 2 t t t t then the above group of order 48 is the direct product of the group generated by the generator 1 1 and the latter group then it can be written as w a 3 c 2 c 2 c 2 t t t t 3 5 here we also note that the group in 3 5 involves the pyritohedral group th w a 3 c 2 c 2 t t as a maximal subgroup the pyritohedral group represents the symmetry of the iron pyrites the second set in 3 4 represents the mirror image of the icosahedron depicted in fig 3 the generation of the vertices of an icosahedron from the proper tetrahe dral group is interesting which will help us to construct the snub 24 cell from the diagram d 4 as the orbit of w d 4 c 2 s 3 t t t t we also note an interesting observation that when two sets of orbits in 3 4 are combined it repre sents a solid with 24 vertices the emerging polyhedron is a quasi regular truncated octahedron obtained as the orbit 4 w b 3 1 0 here the group w b 3 is the octahedral group generated by reflections from the coxeter diagram b 3 the quasi regular truncated octahedron is shown in fig 4 here the faces of the solid are squares of side and the isogonal hexagons with edge lengths and 1 4 construction of snub 24 cell from the diagram d 4 it is clear from the coxeter dynkin diagram of fig 1 that one can generate three tetrahedral subgroups by using the sets of generators r 1 r 2 r 3 r 3 r 2 r 4 r 4 r 2 r 1 and their proper tetrahedral subgroups are generated by the sets r 1 r 2 r 2 r 3 r 3 r 1 r 3 r 2 r 2 r 4 r 4 r 3 r 4 r 2 r 2 r 1 r 1 r 4 in terms of quaternionic notation they can be written as 7 r 1 r 2 r 2 r 3 r 3 r 1 t 4 t 4 r 3 r 2 r 2 r 4 r 4 r 3 t 1 t 1 r 4 r 2 r 2 r 1 r 1 r 4 t 3 t 3 4 1 recall the definition of the weight vectors in terms of quaternionic units in 2 5 these proper tetrahedral groups leave the vectors 4 1 and 3 invariant respectively actually the pyritohedral group w a 3 c 2 c 2 t t can be embedded in the groupw d 4 c 2 in 12 different ways in each case the quaternion q t will be left invariant one can generalize the idea discussed in section 3 to the case of the group w d 4 c 2 it is then straightforward to show that the vectors i 1 3 4 2 and ii 1 3 4 2 can be used to generate two sets of snub 24 cells which are mirror images of each other provided suitable scale factors are chosen in terms of quaternions these vectors read i 1 2 2 i 1 2 e 1 e 3 ii 1 2 2 ii 1 2 e 1 e 3 4 2 note that these vectors are transformed to each other under the exchange of one can generate the vertices of the snub 24 cell by applying the group w d 4 c 2 on these vectors by applying the group elements w d 4 c 2 s 3 t t t t on the vectors in 4 2 one can generate two sets of 96 elements each for example w d 3 c 2 s 3 leads to the following set consisting of 96 unit quaternions 9 s 1 2 e 1 e 3 12 e 2 e 1 1 2 e 3 e 2 1 2 e 1 e 2 12 e 2 e 3 1 2 e 3 e 1 1 2 1 e 1 e 2 12 1 e 2 e 3 1 2 1 e 3 e 1 1 2 e 1 e 2 e 3 12 e 2 e 3 e 1 1 2 e 3 e 1 e 2 4 3 let us recall that the set of 120 unit quaternions i t s represents the elements of the binary icosahedral group as well as the vertices of the platonic polytope 600 cell 10 consisting of 600 tetrahedra the symmetry of which is the coxeter group w h 4 i i i i therefore the set i t s represents the decomposition of the w h 4 polytope under its maximal subgroup w d 4 c 2 s 3 which branches into the set of 24 cell and the set of snub 24 cell applying the same group on the second vector 1 2 2 ii 1 2 e 1 e 3 we would generate the set s s which will be the mirror image of the set s in 4 3 that is one can show for example that r 1 s s of course this is true for any reflection generators of the group w d 4 the operation exchanges so here it plays the role of reflection symmetry for the two mirror images of the snub 24 cell it is well known that the binary icosahedral group 11 has two 2 dimensional 8 irreducible representations if one is represented by the set i t s the other is represented by the set i t s two irreducible representations of the binary icosahedral group will lead to two 4 dimensional irreducible representations of the coxeter group in the form w h 4 i i i i and w h 4 i i i i their common maximal subgroup is w d 4 c 2 s 3 t t t t since w h 4 is a maximal subgroup of the coxeter weyl group w e 8 12 and the root system of the e 8 can be represented as the union of the quaternions i i or i i 13 this analogy can be traced back to the coxeter weyl group w e 8 e 8 and perhaps to the heterotic superstring theory now we come back to the structure of the snub 24 cell in view of the arguments raised in section 3 the group structure in 3 5 can be extended to the groups t 4 t 4 t 4 t 4 t 1 t 1 t 1 t 1 t 3 t 3 t 3 t 3 4 4 each group acting on the vector i will generate an icosahedron the three icosahedra share the same vertex 1 2 e 1 e 3 we can write the vertices of these icosahedra in terms of quaternions from the set s but it is not needed at this moment but we note an important aspect that the centers of these three icosahedra can be represented by the vectors 4 1 3 t respectively up to some scale factor we can prove that the following sets of vectors p 1 i r 1 r 3 i r 3 r 4 i r 4 r 1 i p 2 i r 2 r 1 i r 2 r 3 i r 2 r 4 i p 3 i r 3 r 2 i r 3 r 1 i r 3 r 4 i p 4 i r 4 r 2 i r 4 r 3 i r 4 r 1 i p 5 i r 1 r 2 i r 1 r 1 i r 1 r 4 i 4 5 form five tetrahedra therefore the vector i is shared by three icosahedra and five tetrahedra we note that the dynkin diagram symmetry s 3 permutes the generators r 1 r 3 r 4 but leaves r 2 invariant similarly it permutes the vectors 1 3 4 and leaves the vector 2 invariant and consequently it leaves the vector i invariant this shows that the two tetrahedra p 1 and p 2 are left invariant by the per mutation symmetry while the tetrahedra p 3 p 4 and p 5 are permuted by the symmetric group s 3 one notes that the group generated by r 1 r 3 r 1 r 4 c 2 c 2 klein four group can be extended by the permutation group s 3 to the tetrahedral group td c 2 c 2 s 3 t 2 t 2 t 2 t 2 leaving the vector 2 invariant which represents the center up to a scale factor of the tetrahedron p 1 this group can be extended to the group td c 2 c 2 c 2 s 3 c 2 t 2 t 2 t 2 t 2 which leaves the vectors w 2 invariant then the group td c 2 leaving the vectors 2 2 1 2 1 e 1 t invariant can be em bedded in the group w d 4 c 2 s 3 t t t t in 12 different ways this indicates that the snub 24 cell involves 24 tetrahedra each left invariant un der one of the conjugate tetrahedral group td the centers of these 24 tetrahedra constitute the vertices of a 24 cell t up to some scale factor similarly the symme try group of icosahedrons t qtq t qtq q t can be embedded in the 9 group t t t t in 12 different ways where q t left invariant actually it follows that the centers of the 24 icosahedra belong to the sets v 0 v v so that the icosahedra are grouped as 24 8 8 8 indeed the sets of vectors v 0 v v constitute the weights of the 8 dimensional irreducible representations 8 v 8 s 8 c of the lie group so 8 now what remains is the other set of tetrahedra one can show that the remaining sets of tetrahedra possess the permutation symmetry s 3 only the number of tetrahedra possessing the s 3 symmetry is w d 4 c 2 s 3 s 3 576 6 96 therefore the total number of cells of the snub 24 cell is 144 which consists of 24 icosahedra 24 tetrahedra and 96 tetrahedra the dual of the snub 24 cell has been constructed in the reference 9 to con struct the dual polytope of the snub 24 cell one should determine the vectors repre senting the centers of the cells here three icosahedra and five tetrahedra sharing the same vertex we have already listed the vectors representing the centers of the icosahedra the vectors up to some scale factors representing the centers of the tetrahedra can be written as p 1 2 p 2 4 1 3 4 2 p 3 3 1 3 4 2 2 p 4 3 1 3 4 2 2 p 5 3 1 3 4 2 2 4 6 it is clear that while the first two vectors remain invariant under the symmetry s 3 d 3 the last three vectors are permuted to each other the last three vectors p 3 p 4 p 5 form an equilateral triangle parallel to the equilateral triangle formed by the unit vectors 1 3 4 it is better to express the other five vectors also as unit quaternions using the expressions in 2 5 10 c 1 1 2 p 1 1 2 1 e 1 c 2 4 2 2 p 2 1 2 2 e 1 e 3 c 3 4 2 2 p 3 1 2 2 e 1 e 2 c 4 4 2 2 p 4 1 2 2 e 1 e 3 c 5 4 2 2 p 5 1 2 2 e 1 e 2 4 7 note that the vector c 1 c 2 is orthogonal to the planes determined by the sets of vectors 1 3 4 and c 3 c 4 c 5 to determine the structure of the cell of the dual snub 24 cell one needs to express these eight vectors in the hyperplane orthogonal to the vertex i 1 2 e 1 e 3 we have already noted that the plane determined by 1 3 4 is orthogonal to the vector i one can also check that the hyperplane determined by the five vectors in 4 7 are also orthogonal to the vector i however the planes determined by the set of vectors in 4 7 and the vectors 1 3 4 are not orthogonal to the vector i unless a change of relative scale factor between these sets of vectors is introduced indeed the set of eight vectors 2 1 2 3 2 4 c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 c 5 forms an hyperplane orthogonal to the vertex i now one can express above eight vectors in a new basis of quaternions defined by p 0 i p 1 e 1 p 0 p 2 e 2 p 0 p 3 e 3 p 0 then all eight vectors will have the same component along the unit vector p 0 then the rest of the components define the vectors in the space orthogonal to the vector p 0 which reads 1 2 2 0 1 1 2 2 0 1 1 2 2 1 0 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 0 1 1 2 2 1 2 0 1 2 2 0 1 2 4 8 this solid consists of 9 faces three faces are made of kites of sides 2 2 and 1 2 and six triangular faces of the form of isosceles triangles of sides 2 and 1 2 it has a dihedral symmetry d 3 this typical cell of the dual polytope is depicted in fig 5 the vertex figure of any convex polytope is the convex solid formed by the nearest vertices to the vertex the following nine vertices constitute the set of nearest vectors to the vector i r 1 r 2 i r 2 r 1 i r 1 r 3 i r 2 r 3 i r 3 r 2 i r 1 r 4 i r 4 r 2 i r 2 r 4 i r 3 r 4 i 4 9 when they are expressed in the quaternionic bases p 0 i p 1 e 1 p 0 p 2 e 2 p 0 p 3 e 3 p 0 and the components of p 0 are removed the nine vertices read 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 4 10 11 fig 5 typical cell of the dual polytope of the snub 24 cell a top view b bottom view these vertices form the solid called tridiminished icosahedrons one of the johnson s solid j 63 14 as shown in fig 6 if the additional three vectors 1 0 1 0 0 1 are combined with the vectors in 4 10 we would obtain a regular icosahedron similar to what we have done for the two mirror im fig 6 tridiminished icosahedron ages of the icosahedra in section 3 we can combine two mirror images of the snub 24 cell namely we take the union of the sets s and s to form the set of vectors s s which is now reflection symmetric we observe that the symmetry of the new system extends to the group represented by the coxeter weyl group w d 4 s 3 w f 4 given in 2 10 it can be shown that the 192 vectors of the set s s can be ob tained from the vector 3 4 0 0 1 as the orbit w f 4 to obtain exactly the same set of elements of s s we choose the quaternionic simple roots of w f 4 as 1 1 2 1 e 1 e 2 e 3 2 2 e 3 3 e 2 e 3 4 e 1 e 2 4 11 which define the cartan matrix and its inverse as follows 12 cf 4 2 1 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 2 2 1 0 0 1 2 cf 4 1 2 3 2 2 2 3 6 4 2 2 2 2 2 4 2 6 3 2 2 2 3 2 4 12 one can readily show that 2 2 2 2 0 0 1 1 2 e 1 e 2 s 4 13 applying the group elements of the coxeter group w f 4 one generates the set of vectors of s s the orbit 2 2 w f 4 0 0 1 has an interesting structure it is a polytope consisting of two types of cells cube and truncated octahedron shown in the fig 4 to analyze the cell structures of the orbit w f 4 0 0 1 one needs to look at the subgroups of rank 3 we have two w b 3 groups generated by respectively w b 3 r 1 r 2 r 3 and w b 3 r 2 r 3 r 4 the first group acting on the vector 0 0 1 generate a cube with sides of 2 and the second group will generate a truncated octahedron with faces of isogonal hexagons of edge lengths 2 and 2 and a square of sides 2 the total number of cells of the polytope is 48 24 cube 24 quasiregular truncated octahedron at each vertex of the polytope w f 4 0 0 1 there is one cube and three quasi regular truncated octahedra to show the validity of our argument we apply the group w b 3 r 1 r 2 r 3 on the vector 1 2 e 1 e 2 this octahedral subgroup is expressed in terms of quaternions as w b 3 t 4 t 4 t 4 t 4 t 4 t t 4 t 4 4 14 where 4 1 e 1 which is left invariant the orbit w b 3 r 1 r 2 r 3 will lead to 8 vertices of the cube 1 2 e 1 e 2 12 e 1 e 2 1 2 1 e 1 e 3 12 1 e 1 e 3 1 2 e 1 e 3 12 e 1 e 3 1 2 1 e 1 e 2 12 1 e 1 e 2 4 15 to show that the vectors in 4 15 represent the vertices of a cube we note that the center of the cube is represented by the unit quaternion p 0 1 2 1 e 1 and one defines a new basis of unit vectors as p 0 1 2 1 e 1 p 1 e 1 p 0 1 2 1 e 1 p 2 e 2 p 0 1 2 e 2 e 3 p 3 e 3 p 0 1 2 e 2 e 3 4 16 then removing the common components of the unit vector 2 2 2 p 0 and ignoring an overall factor 2 2 the vectors in 4 15 would read in the new basis of unit vectors p 1 p 2 p 3 13 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 17 these represent the vertices of a cube with the first and the second sets repre senting two dual tetrahedra embedded in the cube one can also project the snub 24 cell to 3 dimensional space to do this one should choose one of its maximal rank 3 subgroups as we noted earlier that the icosahedron in the snub 24 cell has a maximal pyritohedral symmetry either rep resented by th t t t t or th t t t t which leads to the same result in 3 d therefore projecting the snub 24 cell into 3 d leads to a decomposition of 96 vertices of 4 3 as the orbits of the pyritohedral group th this leads to 4 icosahedra as shown in fig 3 classified with respect to the real parts 2 and 2 of the sets of quaternions in 4 3 the other two orbits of size 12 are obtained from the set of quaternions in 4 3 with the real parts given by 1 2 they lead to the solid in fig 7 which is a quasi regular icosahedron dual of a pyritohedron 4 fig 7 quasi regular icosahedron with pyritohedral symmetry the set of 24 quaternions with zero real part constitutes a single orbit under the pyritohedral group which is plotted in fig 8 it consists of three types of faces equilateral triangle golden rectangle and a trapezoid constructed with two edge lengths 2 and 2 1 fig 8 the quasiregular polyhedron with 24 vertices with pyritohedral symmetry 14 5 conclusion the snub 24 cell is an interesting semi regular polytope in 4 d its cells consist of 24 icosahedra and 120 tetrahedra its symmetry is generated by the proper rotational elements of the coxeter group w d 4 extended by the coxeter dynkin diagram symmetry it exists in two chiral forms represented by the sets s and s as explained in the text the union s s with 192 vertices forms a quasi regular polytope of the coxeter weyl group w f 4 the sets i t s and i t s are two representations of 600 cell consisting of tetrahedra which are the orbits of the coxeter group w h 4 they can be traced back to the coxeter group w e 8 e 8 which could be relevant to the heterotic superstring theory the rank 3 subgroups of the symmetry group w d 4 c 2 s 3 t t t t of the snub 24 cell are the pyritohedral group th and the tetrahedral group td each of order 24 they are the respective symmetry groups of the 24 icosahedra and 24 tetrahedra in the snub 24 cell each of the remaining 96 tetrahedral cells possesses permutation symmetry s 3 the dual polytope of the snub 24 cell consists of 144 vertices and 96 cells its typical cell is depicted in fig 5 it is expected that such a unique chiral polytope with its magnificent symmetry might have some relevance to the supersymmetric theories in higher dimensions references 1 d vollhardt and p wolfle the superfluid phases of helium 3
