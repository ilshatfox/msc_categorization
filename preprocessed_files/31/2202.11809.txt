6 0 it is supposed that the tuple is in general position we give a construction of type i and type ii hermite pade polynomials to the given tuple of degrees 6 n and 6 mn respectively and the corresponding m 1 multi indexes with the following property let m 1 z and m 2 z be two m 1 m 1 polynomial matrices m 1 z m 2 z gl m 1 c z generated by type i and type ii hermite pade polynomials respectively then we have m 1 z m 2 z im 1 where im 1 is the identity m 1 m 1 matrix the result is motivated by some novel applications of hermite pade poly nomials to the investigation of monodromy properties of fuchsian systems of differential equations see 12 5 10 6 8 bibliography 12 titles keywords hermite pade polynomials monodromy problem 1 introduction the very well known and very important algebraic relations between type i and type ii hermite pade hp polynomials were discovered by k mahler see 4 these relations connect to each other type i and type ii hp polynomials associated with a tuple of formal power series given at zero point 0 thus from those relations it follows that type i and type ii hp polynomials are not independent in the last decade based on g chudnovsky ideas 1 2 some generalizations of mahler s identities were obtained and successfully applied to the monodromy problems of fuchsian systems of differential equations see 12 5 10 6 7 8 and the bibliography therein similar to mahler s results these generalizations were produced for power series given at zero point 0 but after then while applying the identities to monodromy problems it was made the changing of the variable from to z 1 see 12 and 6 the reason is that it is namely in such a form the identities are applicable to monodromy problems the main purpose of the current paper is to propose a construction of type i and type ii hp polynomials associated with a tuple f 0 fm of formal power series given not at zero point but at the infinity point z under some assumption on the general position of the tuple cf 9 3 11 this construction provides two m 1 m 1 polynomial matrices m 1 z and m 2 z m 1 z m 2 z gl m 1 c z with the following property m 1 z m 2 z im 1 where im 1 is the identity m 1 m 1 matrix 2 the case of m 1 to make our idea of the construction of hp polynomials with the prescribed properties we start with the case when m 1 i e the case of pade polynomials thus we are given a tuple f 0 f 1 of two formal power series at infinity point we assume that the tuple f 0 f 1 is in a general position for 1 http arxiv org abs 2202 11809 v 1 2 sergey p suetin the case m 1 that means that all the indexes of the pade table for the series f f 1 f 0 are normal see 9 evidently it is also the case for the pade table for the reciprocal series 1 f let n 0 n n 1 and n 1 n 1 n be two multi indexes n 1 it is easy to see that for multi index n 0 there exist two polynomials q 0 0 degq 0 0 6 n and q 0 1 degq 0 1 6 n 1 with the following property 1 q 0 0 f 0 zq 0 1 f 1 o 1 zn z 1 from relation 1 it directly follows that q 0 0 0 6 0 indeed for otherwise we have that q 0 0 zq 0 0 where deg q 0 0 6 n 1 therefore from 1 it would follow that q 0 0 q 0 1 f o 1 zn 1 z 2 the relation 2 implies that the index n 1 n 1 is not normal for the series f f 1 f 0 which is in contradiction to our assumption thus we have that degq 0 1 n 1 degq 0 0 n and q 0 0 0 6 0 therefore we can normalize q 0 0 as q 0 0 0 1 just in the similar way we obtain that for multi index n 1 there exist two poly nomials q 1 0 degq 1 0 6 n 1 and q 1 1 degq 1 1 6 n with the property zq 1 0 f 0 q 1 1 f 1 1 zn z 3 based on normality of pade table for the series 1 f it follows from 3 that degq 1 0 n 1 degq 1 1 n q 1 1 0 6 0 and thus we can introduce the normalization q 1 1 0 1 from 1 and 3 it easy follows the relation q 0 0 q 1 z 2 q 0 1 q 1 0 o 1 z 4 therefore the polynomial p q 0 0 q 1 z 2 q 0 1 q 1 0 is constant to find this constant we evaluate this polynomial at zero point to obtain that p 0 1 thus we obtain that q 0 0 q 1 z 2 q 0 1 q 1 0 1 therefore for the 2 2 matrix m z q 0 0 zq 0 1 zq 1 0 q 1 1 we have that detm z 1 and m 1 z q 1 1 zq 0 1 zq 1 0 q 0 0 where degq 0 0 degq 1 1 n cf 12 1 here and in what follows we consider relations similar to 1 only as formal relations in the space of formal power series algebraic properties of hermite pade polynomials 3 3 the case of general m let now consider the tuple f 0 fm of m 2 series in nonnegative powers of 1 z fj 6 0 and such that the tuple is in a general position here general position means that all multi indexes n n 0 nm n m 1 are normal for the hp polynomials associated with the tuple at the infinity point see 9 11 set n n nk n 1 n 1 n k 1 n 1 n 1 nm 1 k 0 m be a multi index it is easy to see that for each k 0 m and the corresponding nk there exist polynomials q k j j 0 m degq k j 6 n 1 j 6 k degq k k 6 n with the following property zq k 0 f 0 zq k k 1 fk 1 q k k fk zq k k 1 zq k m fm o 1 zmn 5 the relation 5 implies that degq k k k and q k k 0 6 0 because otherwise we would obtain that multi index n 1 n 1 nm 1 is not normal for the given tuple f 0 fm therefore we can normalize q k k 0 1 k 0 m for each n n let ds mn 1 mn 1 mn s 1 mn 1 mn 1 nm 1 be a multi index s 0 m it is easy to see that for each s 0 m and the corresponding ds there exist polynomials p s j j 0 m degp s j 6 mn 1 j 6 s degp s s 6 mn with the following property zfsp s j fjp s s o 1 zn j 0 m j 6 s 6 the relations 6 imply that degp s s mn and p s s 0 6 0 because otherwise we would obtain that the multi index mn 1 mn 1 is not normal for the given tuple f 0 fm thus we can normalize p s s 0 1 the following result is valid theorem 1 let m 1 z zq k 0 zq k k 1 q k k zq k k 1 zq k m k 0 m m 2 z zp s 0 zp s s 1 p s s zp s s 1 zp s m s 0 m be two polynomial m 1 m 1 matrices then m 1 z m 2 z im 1 where im 1 is the identity m 1 m 1 matrix proof set uk z zq k 0 zq k k 1 q k k zq k k 1 zq k m k 0 m and vs z zp s 0 zp s s 1 p s s zp s s 1 zp s m s 0 m 4 sergey p suetin be two polynomial vectors then the scalar product pk s z uk z v t s z is a polynomial is z set f f 0 fm from 5 and 6 it follows that pk s z 1 fs uk z fsv t s 1 fs uk z p s s f t o 1 zn 1 fs p s s uk z f t o 1 1 fs p s s o 1 zmn o 1 o 1 7 from 7 we obtain that pk s z o 1 as z thus polynomial pk s z const pk s 0 we have to consider two different cases 1 if k s then pk k z uk z v t k z q k k p k k zp z thus pk k 0 q k k 0 p k k 0 1 2 if k 6 s then pk s z zq z and thus pk s 0 0 theorem 1 is proved references 1 g v chudnovsky rational and pade approximations to solutions
