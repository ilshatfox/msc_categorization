ar x iv 1 00 7 21 22 v 1 m at h c a 1 3 ju l 20 10 on the semiadditivity of the capacities associated with signed vector valued riesz kernels laura prat abstract the aim of this paper is to show the semiadditivity of the capacities as sociated to the signed vector valued riesz kernels of homogeneity in rn 0 n 1 introduction in this paper we study the capacity related to the signed vector valued riesz kernels x x 1 in rn 0 n if e rn is a compact set and 0 n one sets e sup t 1 1 where the supremum is taken over all real distributions t supported on e such that xi x 1 t is a function in l rn and xi x 1 t 1 for 1 i n when n 2 and 1 by the celebrated result of x tolsa t 1 1 is basically analytic capacity recall that the analytic capacity of a compact set e c is defined as e sup t 1 2 the supremum taken over all complex distributions t supported on e whose cauchy potential 1 z t is a bounded function and 1 z t 1 the case n 1 n 2 is also particularly relevant because n 1 coincides with the lipschitz harmonic capacity introduced in p to study problems of c 1 approximation by harmonic functions in rn see also map and v notice that the fact that in the plane analytic capacity and 1 lipschitz harmonic capacity are comparable cannot be deduced just by an inspection of 1 and 2 the reason is that the distributions involved in the supremum in 2 are complex in pr 1 one discovered the fact that if 0 1 then a compact set of finite dimensional hausdorff measure has zero capacity this is in strong contrast with the situation for integer in which dimensional smooth hypersurfaces have 1 http arxiv org abs 1007 2122 v 1 positive capacity see map the case of non integer 1 is not well under stood although it was shown in pr 1 that for ahlfors david regular sets the above mentioned result for 0 1 still holds in this case see also pr 2 in mprv 1 the surprising equivalence between 0 1 and one of the well known riesz capacities of non linear potential theory see ah chapter 1 p 38 was established it was shown that for some positive constant c c 1 c 2 3 n 3 2 e e cc 2 3 n 3 2 e 3 recall that the riesz capacity cs p of a compact set e r n 1 p 0 sp n is defined by cs p e inf p p 1 x n s 1 on e where the infimum is taken over all compactly supported infinitely dierentiable func tions on rn the capacity cs p plays a central role in understanding the nature of sobolev spaces see ah in envo it has been shown that the first inequality in 3 holds for all in dices 0 n the opposite inequality is false when z for example if one takes e contained in a plane with positive dimensional hausdorff measure then e 0 while c 2 3 n 3 2 e 0 it is an open problem to prove or disprove the second inequality in 3 for non integer 1 n since cs p is a subadditive set function as a direct consequence of 3 one gets that is semiadditive that is given compact sets e 1 and e 2 e 1 e 2 c e 1 e 2 for some constant c depending only on n and in fact is countably semiaddi tive in this paper we will show that the semiadditivity of holds for all indices 0 n see corollary 2 below if we restrict the supremum in 1 to distributions t given by positive radon measures supported on e we obtain the capacities clearly we have e e the arguments of this paper will prove that in fact these two quantities are comparable namely theorem 1 there exists an absolute constant c 0 such that for any compact set e rn and any 0 n e c e 4 2 this was first shown for 1 and n 2 by x tolsa t 1 and it was extended to the case n 1 by volberg vo for values of 0 1 the result appears in mprv 1 in mt theorem 1 was proven for a certain class of cantor sets in rn see also t 3 where it is proven for a wider class of cantor sets recently evo have proven that this comparability result also holds on some examples of random cantor sets as a corollary from theorem 1 one deduces that is countably semiadditive for 0 n corollary 2 let e rn be a compact set let ei i 1 be borel sets such that e i 1 ei then i 1 ei c i 1 ei where c is an absolute constant the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we prove corollary 2 in section 3 we deal with one of the main ingredients for the proof of theorem 1 a localization l estimate for the scalar kernels xi x 1 0 n 1 i n in section 4 we prove that the capacities satisfy a exterior regularity property that will be used for the proof of theorem 1 finally in the last section we present a sketch of the proof of theorem 1 it becomes clear that the proof depends on the following three facts a localization l estimate for the riesz kernels the exterior regularity property of 0 n and volberg s extension vo of tolsa s proof of the semiadditivity of analytic capacity t 1 our notation and terminology are standard for example c 0 e denotes the set of all infinitely differentiable functions with compact support contained in the set e cubes will always be supposed to have sides parallel to the coordinate axis l q is the side length of the cube q and q l q n its volume throughout all the paper the letters c c will stand for absolute constants de pending only on n and that may change at different occurrences 2 proof of corollary 2 in this section we will deduce the semiadditivity of the capacity 0 n from theorem 1 for this we need to introduce the riesz transform with respect to an underlying positive radon measure satisfying the growth condition b x r cr x rn r 0 5 3 given 0 we define the truncated riesz transform at level as r f x y x x y x y 1 f y d y x rn for f l 2 the growth condition on insures that each r is a bounded operator on l 2 with operator norm r l 2 possibly depending on we say that the riesz transform is bounded on l 2 when r l 2 sup r l 2 or in other words when the truncated riesz transforms are uniformly bounded on l 2 call l e the set of positive radon measures supported on e which satisfy 5 with c 1 one defines op e by op e sup e l e and r l 2 1 6 as it is well known the capacities e and op e are comparable that is for some positive constant c one has c 1 op e e c op e 7 for each compact set e rn see lemma 3 in pr 2 hence once theorem 1 is available namely the fact that e is comparable to e the semiadditivity of holds because op is obviously semiadditive 3 localization of riesz potentials 3 1 a growth condition let t be a compactly supported distribution in rn and 0 n write with z and 0 1 we say that the distribution t has growth provided g t sup q t q l q 8 where the supremum is taken over all q c 0 q satisfying the normalization inequalities n q l q 9 where n q is defined as follows 1 for z condition 9 means that n q sup s n s q l 1 q cl q 10 4 2 for 0 condition 9 means that n q sup s n s q 1 x n l 1 cl q 11 here we are adopting the standard notation related to multi indexes that is s s 1 s 2 sn where each coordinate sj is a non negative integer and s s 1 sn for a compact set e in rn we define g e as the set of all distributions t supported on e having growth with constant g t at most 1 we start by showing that the usual growth condition for a positive radon measure see 5 is equivalent to the notion of growth for distributions as defined in 8 given a positive radon measure set l sup q q l q where the supremum is taken over all cubes q with sides parallel to the coordinate axis if c 0 q then by an inequality of maz ya mzs p 15 and p 134 d d cl n thus g cl for the reverse inequality given a cube q let q be a function in c 0 2 q such that 1 q on q and s q csl q s s 0 then 10 clearly holds when z for 0 and s n write r n 1 bringing one derivative from s q to the kernel to get integrability in 4 q c and using fubini we obtain s q 1 x n l 1 4 q c s q 1 x n y dy 4 q s q 1 x n y dy c l q r 4 q c q dydx y x n 1 c l q s 4 q q dydx y x n cl q thus n q sup n s q 1 x n l 1 cl q 5 therefore q qd q c g l q next lemma shows that all distributions admissible in the definition of e have growth lemma 3 let t be a distribution supported on the compact set e rn let 0 n and suppose that t has bounded riesz potential x x 1 t then t g e proof our proof uses a reproduction formula for test functions involving the kernel xi x 1 which was first introduced in pr 1 lemma 3 1 there are many variants of this formula depending for instance on whether de dimension n and the integer part of are even or odd we will consider in full detail only the case of odd dimension of the form n 2 k 1 we will also assume that is non integer and that its integer part is even of the form 2 d the argument for the other cases follows the same line of reasoning but using the different variants of the corresponding reproduction formula in our present case the reproduction formula we use reads as follows x c n i 1 k d i xi x 1 1 x n 12 let q be a c 0 q function satisfying the normalization inequalities 9 then by 12 the boundedness of the potential xi x 1 t 1 i n and fubini t q n i 1 xi x 1 t k d i q 1 x n c n i 1 k d i q 1 x n y dy c n i 1 2 q q k d i q z z y n dzdy c 2 q c q k d q z z y n 1 dzdy cl q the other cases namely for odd n even are proven in the same way by using analogous formulae see pr 1 lemma 3 1 3 2 localization of riesz potentials when analyzing the argument for the proof of the semiadditivity of analytic capacity see theorem 1 1 in t 1 one realizes that one of the technical tools used is the fact 6 that the cauchy kernel 1 z localizes in the uniform norm by this we mean that if t is a compactly supported distribution such that 1 z t is a bounded measurable function then 1 z t is also bounded measurable for each compactly supported c 1 function this is an old result which is simple to prove because 1 z is related to the differential operator see g chapter v the same localization result can be proved easily in any dimension for the kernel x x n which is modulo a multiplicative constant the gradient of the fundamental solution of the laplacian again the proof is reasonably straightforward because the kernel is related to a differential operator see p and v in mprv 1 lemma 3 1 we were concerned with the localization of the vector valued riesz kernel x x 1 0 n for general values of there is no differ ential operator in the background and consequently the corresponding localization result becomes far from obvious we state now the general localization lemma proved in mprv 1 in what follows given a cube q q will denote and infinitely differentiable func tion supported on q and such that s q l q s 0 s n lemma 4 let t be a compactly supported distribution in rn and let 0 n suppose that xi x 1 t is a bounded measurable function for 1 i n then there exists some constant c c n 0 such that sup 1 i n xi x 1 qt c sup 1 i n xi x 1 t although lemma 4 is enough for our purposes that is to prove theorem 1 in this paper we will give a proof of a stronger localization result with a shorter and less technically involved proof the main difference between the localization lemma in mprv 1 and the one we prove here is that we localize one component of the vector potential x x 1 t only assuming l estimates on the potential of the same component instead of assuming x x 1 t 1 for the whole vector our new localization lemma reads as follows lemma 5 let t be a compactly supported distribution in rn with growth 0 n such that xi x 1 t is in l rn for some i 1 i n then xi x 1 qt is in l rn and xi x 1 qt c xi x 2 t g t for some positive constant c c n depending only on n for 1 the proof of the above lemma can be found in mprv 2 we remark here that when one deals with indexes z the proof of lemma 5 is less techni cally involved since the derivatives s q s n are ordinary derivatives and 7 therefore supported on the cube q compare 11 with 10 for the proof of lemma 5 we need the following result see lemma 7 in mprv 2 for the case 1 that will be proved after the proof of lemma 5 lemma 6 let t be a compactly supported distribution in rn with growth 0 n then for each coordinate i the distribution xi x 1 qt is a locally integrable function and there exists a point x 0 1 4 q such that xi x 1 qt x 0 c g t where c c n is a positive constant depending only on n proof of lemma 5 without loss of generality take i 1 we distinguish two cases 1 x 3 2 q c then k 1 qt x t q y k 1 x y notice that for an appropiate dimensional constant c the function q y cl q q y k 1 x y satisfies the normalization inequalities in the definition of g t namely n q l q 13 therefore k 1 qt x cl q t q c to see 13 observe that if denotes the integer part of and we write then by leibniz formula s q l q cl q s r 0 l q r l q s r cl q s 14 for any multiindex s s 1 sn with s 0 if 0 14 immediately implies that condition 13 holds when 0 let s s 1 sn be any multiindex with s n and write s q 1 z n y dy 2 q s q 1 z n y dy 2 q c s q 1 z n y dy a b 8 by 14 we have a c s q 2 q q dzdy z y n cl q and by bringing one derivative from s q to the kernel z n and using 14 again we get b c 2 q c t q 1 z n 1 y dy c t q 2 q c q dzdy z y n 1 cl q 15 for some multiindex t with t n 1 2 x 3 2 q since k 1 t and q are bounded functions we can write k 1 qt x k 1 qt x q x k 1 t x q k 1 t let q c 0 r n be such that q 1 in 2 q q 0 in 4 q c and s q cs l q s for each multi index s then one is tempted to write k 1 qt x q x k 1 t x t q y q y q x k 1 x y q t 1 q y k 1 x y the problem is that the first term in the right hand side above does not make any sense because t is acting on a function of y which is not necessarily differentiable at the point x to overcome this difficulty one needs to use a standard regularization process take c b 0 1 such that x dx 1 and set x n x the plan is to estimate uniformly on x and k 1 qt x q x k 1 t x 16 clearly 16 tends as tends to zero to k 1 qt x q x k 1 t x for almost all x rn which allows the transfer of uniform estimates we now have k 1 qt x q x k 1 t x t q y q y q x k 1 x y q t 1 q y k 1 x y a 1 a 2 9 where the last identity is the definition of a 1 and a 2 to deal with term a 1 set k 1 x y k 1 x y we claim that for an appropriate dimensional constant c the test function f y cl q q y q y q x k 1 x y satisfies the normalization inequalities 9 in the definition of g t with q replaced by f if this is the case then a 1 cl q t f c g t to prove the claim we have to show that n f l q 17 we first notice that the regularized kernel k 1 satisfies the inequalities s k 1 x c x s x rn 0 and 0 s n 1 18 where c is a dimensional constant which in particular is independent of the estimate of the l 1 norm in 17 requires the use of leibniz formula s q q q x k 1 x s r 0 cr s r q q q x s r k 1 x 19 and of 18 notice that for any multiindex t t 1 tn with t n 1 tf l 1 4 q cl q t r 0 1 l q r 4 q t r k 1 x y dy cl q n t cl q 1 20 and if s s 1 sn is such that s n using the mean value theorem to gain integrability when r 0 and 18 sf l 1 4 q cl q q 4 q dy y x s 1 cl q s r 1 1 l q r 4 q s r k 1 x y dy cl q 21 10 estimate 21 immediately yields 17 for 0 n f sup s n 4 q sf y dy cl q if 0 then for any multiindex s s 1 sn with s n sf 1 z n y dy 5 q sf 1 z n y dy c 5 q c tf 1 z n 1 y dy b 1 b 2 where t is some multiindex with t n 1 to estimate b 2 we use fubini and 20 then b 2 4 q tf z 5 q c dydz z y n 1 cl q we turn now to term b 1 by fubini and 21 we get b 1 c 5 q sf z 4 q dydz y z n cl q this finishes the proof of 17 we now turn to a 2 by lemma 6 there exists a point x 0 q such that k 1 qt x 0 c g t then k 1 1 q t x 0 c k 1 t g t the analogous inequality holds as well for the regularized potentials appearing in a 2 uniformly in and therefore a 2 c t 1 q k 1 x k 1 x 0 c k 1 t g t to estimate t 1 q k 1 x k 1 x 0 we decompose r n x into a union of rings rj z r n 2 j l q z x 2 j 1 l q j z and consider functions j in c 0 r n with support contained in 3 2 rj such that s j c 2 j l q s s 0 and j j 1 on r n x then since x 3 2 q and 1 q 0 in 2 q the smallest ring rj that may intersect 2 q c is r 2 therefore we have 11 t 1 q k 1 x k 1 x 0 t j 2 j 1 q k 1 x k 1 x 0 t j i j 1 q k 1 x k 1 x 0 j j t j k 1 x k 1 x 0 where i denotes the set of indices j 2 such that the support of j intersects 4 q and j the remaining indices namely those j 2 such that the support of j is contained in the complement of 4 q notice that the cardinality of i is bounded by a dimensional constant set g c l q j i j 1 q k 1 x k 1 x 0 and for j j gj c 2 j 2 jl q j k 1 x k 1 x 0 we show now that the test functions g and gj j j satisfy the normalization inequalities 9 in the definition of g t once this is available using the growth condition of t we obtain t 1 q k 1 x k 1 x 0 cl q t g c j j 2 j 2 jl q t gj c g t c j 2 2 j g t c g t which completes the proof of lemma 7 we check now the normalization inequalities for g and gj for g one argues as in the proof of 17 using that s 1 q cl q s s j c l q s j i 18 the fact that x x 0 3 2 q y 2 q c and a gradient estimate for gj we use in addition leibniz formula and a gradient estimate to show that for j j and n 1 s n sgj c 2 j 2 j l q s r 0 1 2 jl q r l q 2 j l q 1 s r c 2 jl q s 22 12 if 0 we use 22 to obtain n gj sup s n sgj y dy c 2 jl q if 0 then for any multiindex s s 1 sn with s n 1 using fubini 22 and arguing similar to the proof of 17 we get for some multiindex t t 1 tn with t n 1 sgj 1 z n y dy 2 rj sgj 1 z n y dy c 2 rj c tgj 1 z n 1 y dy c 2 jl q therefore we can conclude that n gj c 2 jl q proof of lemma 6 without loss of generality set i 1 and write k 1 x x 1 x 1 since k 1 qt is infinitely differentiable off the closure of q we only need to show that k 1 qt is integrable on 2 q we will actually prove a stronger statement namely that k 1 qt is in l p 2 q for each p in the interval 1 p n indeed fix any q satisfying n n 1 q and call p the dual exponent so that 1 p n we need to estimate the action of k 1 qt on functions c 0 2 q in terms of q we clearly have k 1 qt t q k 1 we claim that for an appropriate dimensional constant c the test function q k 1 c l q n p q satisfies the normalization inequalities 9 in the definition of g t once this is proved by the definition of g t we get k 1 qt c l q n p qg t and so k 1 qt lp 2 q c l q n p g t 13 hence 1 1 4 q 1 4 q k 1 qt x dx 4 n 1 q q k 1 qt x p dx 1 p c g t which completes the proof of lemma 8 to prove the claim we have to show that n q k 1 c l q n p q 23 write with 0 1 and z we distinguish now two cases 0 and 0 1 case 0 i e z this is the easiest case because the derivatives appearing in 23 are ordinary derivatives see also lemma 7 in mprv 2 let s s 1 s 2 sn be any multiindex with s n using leibniz formula s q k 1 s r 0 cs r r q s r k 1 24 we obtain q s q k 1 y dy c 2 q sk 1 y dy c s r 1 q r q y s r k 1 y dy a b to estimate term a we remark that for s n sk 1 c t where t is a smooth homogeneous convolution caldero n zygmund operator and c a constant depending on s this can be seen by computing the fourier transform of sk 1 and then using that each homogeneous polynomial can be decomposed in terms of homogeneous harmonic polynomials of lower degrees see st p 69 since caldero n zygmund operators preserve lq rn 1 q we get using ho lder a cl q n p q 14 to estimate term b we use s rk 1 x c x s r fubini the fact that r q cl q r and ho lder to obtain b cl q n p q

first with term a bringing one derivative from s q k 1 to the kernel x n and using fubini we obtain a c 2 q c t q k 1 1 x n 1 x dx for some multiindex t t 1 tn with t n 1 we will now use leibniz formula 24 with s replaced by t and the fact that t rk 1 x c x t r 25 therefore since t r n by fubini and ho lder we obtain q t q k 1 y dy c t r 0 q r q y t r k 1 y dy c t r 0 2 q x q r q y y x t r dydx c ql q n p 1 26 15 hence if we apply fubini again we get a c q t q k 1 y 2 q c dxdy y x n 1 cl q n p q to estimate term b we will use 24 and for each 0 r t we will add and substract r q x t r k 1

identity being a definition for b 1 b 2 and b 3 since arguing as in 26 recall that t n 1 we obtain q t r k 1 y dy ql q n p 1 r by the mean value theorem and fubini we get that b 1 t r 0 c l q r 1 q t r k 1 y 2 q dxdy y x n c t r 0 l q r 1 ql q n p 1 r l q cl q n p q 27 16 we deal now with term b 2 by computing the fourier transform of the con volution t rk 1 1 y n 1 one can see that for r 0 tk 1 1 y n 1 x c cs 0 x where c is a constant and s 0 is a smooth homogeneous convolution caldero n zygmund operator for r 1 we obtain t rk 1 1 y n 1 x csr x with sr a convolution operator with kernel of

will be used in the proof of theorem 1 lemma 7 let ej j be a decreasing sequence of compact sets with intersection the compact set e rn and let 0 n then e lim j ej proof since by definition the set function in non decreasing lim j ej e and the limit clearly exists for each j 1 let tj be a distribution such that the potential x x 1 tj is in the unit ball of l rn and ej 1 j tj 1 ej 18 we want to show that for each test function tj j t 28 for some distribution t whose potential x x 1 t is in the unit ball of l rn if 28 holds and is a test function satisfying 1 in a neighbourhood of e then lim j ej lim j tj 1 lim j tj t e to show 28 set k x 1 x n and f ij xi x 1 tj 1 i n we will treat first the case n odd and of the form n 2 k 1 by 12 tj c n i 1 f ij k i k c n i 1 f ij x k i k x dx we mention here that if n 2 k then one argues in the same way but one has to use another reproduction formula analogous to 12 for this case see pr 1 lemma 3 1 passing to a subsequence we can assume that for each 1 i n f ij f i in the weak topology of l rn but then f ij x k i k x f i x k i k x x r n since this pointwise convergence is bounded the dominated convergence theorem yields lim j tj c lim j n i 1 f ij x k i k x dx c n i 1 f i x k i k x dx define the distribution t by t c n i 1 f i x k i k x dx now we want to show that for 1 i n f i xi x 1 t for that we regularize f ij and tj take c 0 b 0 1 with x dx 1 and set x n x then we have as j xi x 1 tj x f i j x f i x x rn 19 because f ij converges to f i weak in l rn on the other hand since xi x 1 c rn and tj tends to t in the weak topology of distributions with controlled supports we have xi x 1 tj x xi x 1 t x x rn hence xi x 1 t f i 0 and so letting 0 xi x 1 t f i 5 sketch of the proof of theorem 1 this section will be devoted to the proof of inequality 4 namely e c e we will adapt the line of reasoning in t 1 and t 2 where tolsa proves the semiad ditivity of analytic capacity and continuous analytic capacity respectively we will also use the modifications introduced in vo where the semiadditivity of lipschitz harmonic capacity is proven see also rt in fact when one analizes the proofs of t 1 t 2 and vo one realizes that they depend on two technical facts the exterior regularity property of see lemma 7 and an l localization result which is theorem 5 in our setting we must mention that the positivity properties of the symmetrization method for the cauchy kernel discovered in me and mev are an important ingredient for the proofs of t 1 and t 2 in vo one has to circumvent this lack of positivity and modify tolsa s idea we will explain now how each of the above mentioned main ingredients take part in the proof of 4 as we proved in lemma 7 the capacities 0 n enjoy the exterior regularity property this is also true for the capacities 0 n just by the weak compactness of the the set of positive measures having total variation not exceeding 1 we therefore can approximate a general compact set e by sets which are finite unions of cubes of the same side length in such a way that the capacities and of the approximating sets are as close as we wish to those of e thus we can assume without loss of generality that e is a finite union of cubes of the same size this will allow to implement an induction argument on the size of certain n dimensional rectangles the first step involves rectangles of diameter comparable to the side length of the cubes whose union is e the starting point of the general inductive step in the proof of tolsa s theorem in t 1 and t 2 and in vo for the lipschitz harmonic capacity case consists in the construction of a positive radon measure supported on a compact set f which approximates e in an appropriate sense the construction of f and gives readily that e c f 29 20 and f c e 30 which tells us that f is not too small but also not too big however one cannot expect in the context of t 1 and t 2 the cauchy singular integral to be bounded on l 2 in our case one cannot expect the riesz operator r to be bounded on l 2 one has to carefully look for a compact subset g of f such that f c g the restriction g of to g has growth the operator r g is bounded on l 2 g with dimensional constants moreover recall from 7 that one has c 1 op e e c op e this completes the proof because then e c f c g c op g c op f c f c e c op e in t 1 t 2 and vo the set f is defined as the union of a special family of cubes qi n i 1 that cover the set e and approximate e at an appropriate intermediate scale one then sets f n i 1 qi the construction of the set f is different in the analytic capacity case and in the lipschitz harmonic capacity case in tolsa s proof this construction is performed by using the positivity properties of the symmetrization of the cauchy kernel discovered in me and mev in our setting the symmetrization of the riesz kernels x x 1 only gives a positive quantity for 0 1 see pr 1 lemma 4 2 therefore we have to circumvent the use of this positivity property and therefore modify tolsa s idea for this modification we will follow chapter 5 of vo where this was done for the lipschitz harmonic capacity case namely for n 1 in fact the arguments in chapter 5 of vo are written for more general caldero n zygmund kernels of homo geneity and so they also work in our setting therefore the construction of the approximating set f with properties 29 and 30 can be done just as in vo ch 5 by the definition of the capacity it follows that there exists a real distribution t 0 supported on the compact set e such that 1 t 0 1 e 2 21 2 t 0 has growth and g t 0 1 3 xj x 1 t 0 1 1 j n the construction of is performed simultaneously with that of a real measure which should be viewed as a model for t 0 adapted to the family of cubes qi n i 1 for each cube qi choose a ball bi concentric with qi with radius ri comparable to e 2 qi and set n i 1 r i ln bi ln bi consider now functions i c 0 2 qi 0 i 1 s i c l qi s and n i 1 i 1 on i qi the measure is defined as n i 1 t 0 i ln bi ln bi with ln being the n dimensional lebesgue measure notice that supp supp f moreover we have d bd with b t 0 i r i on bi at this point we need to show that our function b is bounded to apply later a suitable t b theorem to estimate b we need the localization lemma 5 proved in section 3 2 which gives us xj x 1 it 0 c 1 j n we therefore obtain by the definition of t 0 i c 2 qi e for 1 i n 31 hence b c it is now easy to see why e c f e 2 t 0 1 2 n i 1 t 0 i c n i 1 e 2 qi c f now everything is ready to apply a suitable variant of the t b theorem see ntvo there is still one more difficulty in applying the nazarov treil and volberg t b type theorem one needs finding a substitute for what they call the suppressed operators it was already explained in pr 1 that there are at least two versions of such operators for the riesz kernels that work appropriately see pr 1 2 7 and 2 13 22 references ah d r adams and l i hedberg function spaces
