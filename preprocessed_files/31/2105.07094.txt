properties of discrete measures in the first part of the paper we prove that for each probability measure supp 1 1 which logarithmic potential is a continuous function on 1 1 there exists a discrete measure supp 1 1 with the following property let pn x be the sequence of polynomials orthogonal with respect to then 1 n pn n where is zero counting measure for the corresponding polynomial the construction of the measure is based of the properties of weighted leja points in the second part we give an example of a compact set and a sequence of discrete measures supported on that compact set with the following property the sequence of measures converges in weak topology to the equilibrium measure for the compact set but the corresponding sequence of the logarithmic potentials does not converge to the equilibrium potential in any neighbourhood of the compact set bibliography 6 titles 1 1 1 let 1 1 and be a probability measure such that supp and the corresponding logarithmic potential v z of is a continuous function on for a measure supp we denote by pn x x n the monic polynomials which are orthogonal with respect to pn x x k d x 0 k 0 n 1 1 for an arbitrary polynomial q c z we denote by q the zero counting measure of q in accordance with their multiplicities of zeros q q 0 it is well known 4 5 that if 0 a e on then lim n pn 1 z pn z 1 2 z z 2 1 1 2 z here z 2 1 1 2 z 1 as z thus we have as n 1 n pn d 1 dx 1 x 2 2 notice that under a weaker condition on the relation 2 was proven in 2 the following statement holds date may 15 2021 1 http arxiv org abs 2105 07094 v 2 2 sergey p suetin proposition 1 let be a probability measure such that supp and the logarithmic potential v z of is a continuous function on then there exists a measure supp such that cf 2 1 n pn n 3 1 2 for the proof of proposition 1 we use the results which concerns the existence and properties of the weighted leja points see 3 and 6 chapter v recall that leja points for an arbitrary compact set k c belong to the boundary k of k they produce a sequence zn n 1 and are defined by induc tion in the following way once the points z 1 zn k are already defined the point zn 1 k is defined not uniquely from the relation n j 1 zn 1 zj max z k n j 1 z zj 4 when there are a few points satisfying the relation 4 we choose an arbitrary point from this set as zn 1 the following result was proven by f leja 3 theorem f leja 3 let k c be a regular compact set such that c k is a domain let zn be leja points for k set pn z n k 1 z zk then the following relation holds lim n log pn z 1 n gk z k z k 5 where gk z is the green function for the domain c k k is the robin constant for k following the monograph 6 chapter v we define the w weighted leja points xn for the compact set 1 1 where w x ev x once the points x 1 xn are already defined the point xn 1 is defined non uniquely from the relation env xn 1 n j 1 xn 1 xj max x env x n j 1 x xj 6 as before when there are a few points satisfying to the relation 6 we choose an arbitrary point from this set as xn 1 in 6 chapter v p 258 theorem 1 1 a general theorem on the limit properties of weighted leja points was proven from this theorem it follows that for the sequence xn which satisfies the condition 6 the following relation holds 1 n n k 1 xk n 7 thus we have that lim n log n k 1 z xk 1 n v z z c 8 two examples based on the properties of discrete measures 3 of proposition 1 let q 0 1 2 below we construct a sequence of positive numbers n n 1 with the following properties 1 n 0 as n 2 n 1 n 3 k n 1 k n notice that the above conditions 1 3 are fulfilled in particular for the sequence n q n 2 q 0 1 2 this fact will also be used in the future let fix some n 0 n and let 1 n 0 be some positive numbers let xn be a sequence of w weighted leja points for in the sense of the definition 6 and 7 set n n k 1 k xk for n n 0 it is clear that pn x n x x 1 x xn let now n min 16 k s 6 n xk xs let choose a number n 1 0 qn 2 n such that for each measure of the type n 2 n 1 n k 1 k xk 2 n 1 supp 1 6 1 the following property holds if pn x n k 1 x x k is the n th polynomials orthogonal with respect to then xk x k 1 2 min qn 2 n k 1 n 9 uniformly for all measures supp 1 6 1 this can always be done because the n th orthogonal polynomial pn x depends on the first 2 n moments of the measure only now set n 1 n 1 k 1 k xk and let continue the above procedure further as the result we will get a measure n 1 n xn 10 with the following properties measure supported on supp and for each n n 0 for the zeros xn k k 1 n of the corresponding n th orthogonal polynomial pn x x n x xn 1 x xn n the following relation holds xk xn k qn 2 k 1 n 11 hence we have uniformly on z k c log pn z n k 1 log z xk xk xn k n k 1 log z xk log 1 xk xn k z xk log n k 1 z xk n k 1 log 1 o qn 2 12 4 sergey p suetin from this it follows that uniformly on z k c cf 5 lim n log pn z 1 n v z 13 therefore as n 1 n pn relation 3 is proven 2 in this section we construct two examples of compact sets and sequences of discrete measures supported on those compact sets with the following property these sequences converge in weak topology to the equilibrium measures for the compact sets but the corresponding sequences of the logarithmic potentials do not converge to the equilibrium potentials in any neighbourhood of the compact sets the construction is based on the following well known property of the logarith mic capacity see 1 chapter vii 1 theorem 2 let pn z z n be an arbitrary monic polynomial of degree n then for each non generated compact set f c and the corresponding e z pn z f we have that cap e cap f 1 n 14 in particularly for the case of a disk f w w 6 n we obtain cap z pn z 6 n the following statement was given by herbert stahl in 7 p 166 but without details proposition 2 let z z 1 be the unit circle n be the sequence of probability measures associated with the zeros of monic polynomials zn 1 n 1 n n j 1 zn j zn j are the roots of degree n from 1 let be the equilibrium measure for the unit circle then n as n but v n z cap 6 v z in any neighbourhood of the compact set proof let fix an arbitrary 0 and consider the set en z z 1 v n z v z where v z log 1 z z 1 we have that v n z v z 1 n n j 1 log 1 z zn j log 1 z 1 n log z n zn 1 two examples based on the properties of discrete measures 5 therefore en z z 1 1 n log zn zn 1 z z 1 1 n log zn zn 1 z z 1 zn 1 6 zn e n z zn 1 zn 1 6 e n z pn z fn e n where fn w w 1 w 1 6 e n w pn z zn let 1 and k z z 6 then for all natural n large enough n n 0 we have that e n k hence en k e n for n n 0 therefore from 14 it follows that cap en k cap e n cap fn 1 n it is easy to see that 1 4 e n cap fn e n thus cap en k 1 4 1 n e 6 0 as n 0 proposition 3 let k 1 1 n be the sequence of probability measures as sociated with chebyshev polynomials of first kind for k let k be the equilibrium measure for the segment k then n k as n but v n z cap 6 v k z in any neighbourhood of the compact set k proof let fix an arbitrary 0 and consider the set en z v n z v k z where v k z log 2 z z z z 2 1 1 2 we obtain that en z 1 n log 1 tn z log 2 z z 1 n log z n 2 ntn z z 1 n log z n 2 ntn z z z n 2 ntn z e n z 2 ntn z z n 6 e n z tn z 6 2 n z n e n z tn z 6 2 ne n z tn z fn e n where fn w w 6 2 ne n let k z z 6 1 be the closer of an ellipse it is well known that for the chebyshev polynomials tn z z n the explicit representation is valid tn z 1 2 n z n z n z k from this it follows that e n k for all n large enough n n 0 hence en k e n for n n 0 therefore from 14 it follows that cap en k cap e n cap fn 1 n 6 sergey p suetin since cap fn 1 n e 2 then cap en k 1 2 e 6 0 as n 0 references 1 g m goluzin geometric theory of functions of a complex variable transl
