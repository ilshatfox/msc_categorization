mail benchrouda ahmed gmail com july 28 2019 abstract this paper is devoted to the study of the dirichlet problem associated with the dunkl laplacian k we establish under some condition on a bounded domain d of r d the existence of a unique continuous function h on rd such that kh 0 on d and h f on rd d the complement of d in rd where the function f is asumed to be continuous we also give an analytic formula characterizing the solution h 1 introduction let r be a root system in rd d 1 and we fix a positive subsystem r of r and a nonnegative multiplicity function k r r for every r let h be the hyperplane orthogonal to and be the reflection with respect to h that is for every x rd x x 2 x 2 where denotes the euclidean inner product of rd the dunkl laplacian k is defined 3 for f c 2 rd by kf x f x 2 r k f x x 2 2 f x f x x 2 where denotes the gradient on rd obviously k when k 0 given a bounded open subset d of rd we consider the following dirichlet problem kh 0 on d h f on rd d 1 where f is a continuous function on rd d when d is invariant under all reflections it was shown in 1 using probabilistic tools from potential theory that there exists a unique continuous function h on rd twice differentiable on d and such that both equations in 1 are pointwise fulfilled in this paper we shall investigate problem 1 for a bounded domain 1 http arxiv org abs 1402 5605 v 1 d which is not invariant let d be a bounded open set such that its closure d is in some domain of rd r h we mean by a solution of problem 1 every function h rd r which is continuous on rd such that h f on rd d and rd h x k x wk x dx 0 for every c c d where c c d denotes the space of infinitely differentiable functions on d with compact support and wk is the invariant weight function defined on r d by wk x r x 2 k the set d is called k regular if for every continuous function f on r d d problem 1 admits one and only one solution this solution will be denoted by h k d f by transforming problem 1 to a boundary value problem associated with schro dinger s operator q we show that d is k regular provided it is regular we also give an analytic formula characterizing the solution h k d f see theorem 1 below we derive from this formula that for every x d h kd f x depends only on the values of f on r d and on d the euclidean boundary of d if in addition we assume that f is locally ho lder continuous on r d then h k d f is continuously twice differentiable on d and therefore the first equation in 1 is fulfilled by h k d f not only in the sense of distributions but also pointwise it was shown in 5 6 that the operator k is hypoelliptic on all invariant open subset d of rd however if d is not invariant the question whether k is hypoelliptic on d or not remaind open for k regular open set d we show that if d is not invariant then k is not hypoelliptic in d hence the condition d is invariant is necessary and sufficient for the hypoellipticity of k on d 2 main results we first present various facts on the dirichlet boundary value problem associated with schro dinger s operator which are needed for our approach we refer to 2 4 for details let g be the green function on rd but without the constant factors g x y x y 2 d if d 3 ln 1 x y if d 2 x y if d 1 let d be a bounded domain of rd and let q j d the kato class on d i e q is a borel measurable function on rd such that g 1 d q the green potential of 1 d q is continuous on r d note that the kato class j d contains all bounded borel measurable functions on d assume that d is regular then for every continuous function f on d there exists a unique continuous function h on d such that h f on d and h x q x dx 0 for every c c d 2 in the sequel we denote h q d f the unique continuous extension on d of f which satisfies the schro dinger s equation 2 let g d and g q d denotes respectively the green potential 2 operator in d of and q the operator g qd acts as a right inverse of the schro dinger s operator q i e for every borel bounded function g on d we have g q d g x q x dx g x x dx for every c c d then the unique continuous function h on d such that h f on d and h x q x dx g x x dx for every c c d 3 is given for x d by h x h q d f x g q d g x 4 the function g q d g is continuous on d vanishing on r d d and for every x d g q d g x g dg x g d qg q d g x 5 moreover if in addition we assume that q c d then proceeding by induction it follows from 5 that g q d g cn d if and only if g dg cn d n n now we are ready to establish our first main result giving a characterization of solutions of the dirichlet boundary value problem associated with the dunkl laplacian k theorem 1 let d be a bounded open set such that d is in some domain of rd r h if d is regular then d is k regular moreover for every continuous function f on r d d and for every x d h k d f x 1 wk x h q d f wk x g q d wknf x 6 where q and nf are the functions defined for x d by q x r k x 2 and nf x r 2 k x 2 f x proof let f be a continuous function on rd d we intend to prove existence and uniqueness of a continuous function h on d such that h f on rd d and h x k x wk x dx 0 for every c c d 7 it is clear that wk x wk x r k x then using the fact that 3 r k k x x r 2 k 2 x 2 3 direct computation shows that wk x wk x r 2 k 2 k x 2 thus for every c c d wk x wk x x 2 r k x x 2 2 x x 2 q x x wk x and thereby wk x k x wk x q x x wk x wk x n x 8 since the map wk is invertible on the space c c d and the function x wk x x 2 is invariant under the reflection equation 7 is equivalent to the following schro dinger s equation for every c c d h x wk x q x dx wk x nf x x dx finally since q is bounded on d and therefore is in j d the statements follow from 3 and 4 to construct a regular set d it suffices to choose d such that its euclidean boundary d satisfies the the geometric assumption known as cone condition i e for every z d there exists a cone c of vertex z such that c b z r rd d for some r 0 where b z r is the ball of center z and radius r see for example 4 remark 2 note that in order to obtain q j d the hypothesis of the above theorem d rd r h is nearly optimal indeed assume that there exists a cone cz of vertex z d h for some r with k 6 0 such that crz cz b z r d for some r 0 then g 1 dq z 2 k 2 cr z g z y 1 y 2 dy 2 k 2 cr z g z y 1 z y 2 dy k 2 cr z z g 0 y 1 y 2 dy it is easy to see that for every x d the map f h kd f x defines a positive radon measure on rd d we denote this measure by h kd x dy the following results are obtained in a convenient way by using formula 6 of the above theorem 4 corollary 3 for every x d h kd x dy is a probability measure supported by d r d and satisfies wk x wk y h k d x dy h q d x dy r 2 k y 2 g q d x y dy corollary 4 let d be a regular bounded open set such that d is in some domain of r d r h let f be a continuous function on d r d if f is locally ho lder continuous on r d then h k d f c 2 d and for every x d k h k d f x 0 proof since h q d f wk is a solution of the schro dinger s equation 2 the hypoellipticity of the operator q on d implies that h qd f wk c d moreover since nf is locally ho lder continuous on d g d wknf c 2 d and consequently g qd wknf c 2 d then it follows from 6 that h k d f c 2 d for every c c d direct computation using 8 yields k h k d f x x wk x dx h k d f x k x wk x dx this completes the proof let d be an open subset of rd the operator k is said to be hypoelliptic on d if for every f c d every continuous function h on rd which satisfies rd h x k x wk x dx f x x wk x dx for every c c d is infinitely differentiable on d we note that the problem of the hypoellipticity of k is discussed in 5 6 where the authors show that k is hypoelliptic on d provided d is invariant under all reflections however if d is not invariant the question whether k is hypoelliptic on d or not remaind open theorem 5 let d be a k regular open set then k is hypoelliptic on d if and only if d is invariant proof it is obviously sufficient to prove that k is not hypoelliptic on d provided d is not invariant assume that d is not invariant since the open set d r h is also not invariant there exists a nonempty open ball b such that b d r h and b rd d for some r we also choose the ball b small enough such that for every r b d or b rd d 5 let i r b rd d and j r i let f be a continuous function on r d d and denote h kd f by h since b is regular and h satisfies h x k x wk x dx 0 for every c c b it follows from theorem 1 that b is k regular and for every x b h x 1 wk x h q b h wk x g q b wknh x 9 let g 1 and g 2 be the functions defined on b by g 1 x j 2 k x 2 h x and g 2 x i 2 k x 2 f x it is clear that the function g 2 is not trivial and nh g 1 g 2 now assume that h c d then g 1 c b and therefore g qb wkg 1 c b furthermore since h q b h wk c b it follows from 9 that g qb wkg 2 c b thus q g q b wkg 2 wkg 2 c b and therefore g 2 c b a contradiction hence h is not infinitely differentiable ond and consequently the dunkl laplacian k is not
