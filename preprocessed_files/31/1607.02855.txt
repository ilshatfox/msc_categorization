the random polynomials pn z n k 0 akbk z where ak k 0 are non trivial i i d complex random variables poly nomials bk k 0 are deterministic and are selected from a standard basis such as szego bergman or faber polynomials associated with a jordan domain g bounded by an analytic curve we show that the zero counting measures of pn converge almost surely to the equilibrium measure on the boundary of g if and only if e log a 0 1 introduction zeros of polynomials of the form pn z n k 0 akz k where an nk 0 are random coefficients have been studied by bloch and po lya littlewood and offord erdo s and offord kac rice hammersley shparo and shur arnold and many other authors the early history of the subject with numerous references is summarized in the books by bharucha reid and sam bandham 10 and by farahmand 12 it is well known that under mild conditions on the probability distribution of the coefficients the majority of zeros of these polynomials accu mulate near the unit circumference being equidistributed in the angular sense introducing modern terminology we call a collection of random polynomials pn z n k 0 akz k n n the ensemble of kac polynomials let zk nk 1 be the zeros of a polynomial pn of degree n and define the zero counting measure n 1 n n k 1 zk the fact of equidistribution for the zeros of random polynomials can now be expressed via the weak convergence of n to the normalized arclength measure t on the unit circumference t where d t e it dt 2 namely we have that n w t with probability 1 abbreviated as a s or almost surely more recent work on the global distribution of zeros of kac polynomials include papers of ibragimov and zaporozhets 18 kabluchko and zaporozhets 19 20 etc in particular ibragimov and zaporozhets 18 proved that if the coefficients are independent and identically distributed non trivial random variables then the condition e log a 0 is necessary and sufficient for n w t almost surely here e x denotes the expectation of a random variable x and x is called non trivial if p x 0 1 1 http arxiv org abs 1607 02855 v 1 asymptotic distribution of zeros for deterministic polynomials and especially zeros of sections of a power series has a long history that dates back to at least the work of jentzsch and szego see e g andrievskii and blatt 1 for an overview it is natural to use the wealth of accumulated results in the study of zeros for random power series a number of authors followed this approach and the recent paper of ferna ndez 13 deduces the above result of ibragimov and zaporozhets from the criterion of equidistribution of zeros of partial sums due to carlson bourion and erdo s fried ferna ndez shows that the gauge of a random power series satisfying the assumption of ibragimov and zaporozhets is equal to 1 so that the carlson bourion characterization of zero equidistribution applies see 13 for details we present a similar and perhaps somewhat simpler argument that proves the result of ibragimov and zaporozhets the assumption e log a 0 for a sequence of non trivial i i d complex random variables an n 0 is well known to be equivalent to lim sup n an 1 n 1 a s while e log a 0 holds if and only if the above lim sup is infinite with probability one see arnold 2 ibragimov and zaporozhets 18 etc thus the radius of convergence for the random power series k 0 akz k is either 1 or 0 almost surely in particular this series converges in the unit disk a s under the assumption e log a 0 which immediately gives that no point inside d can be a point of accumulation for the zeros of partial sums pn by hurwitz s theorem moreover the results of jentzsch and szego provide us a subsequence of partial sums with equidistributed zeros according to the measure t if the counting measures n fail to converge to t along a subsequence nk k n then we show that for some c q 0 1 the coefficients satisfy an qn cnk n nk a s the above behavior of the coefficient sequence is often referred to as hadamard ostrowski gaps on the other hand we prove that for any sequence of non trivial i i d random coefficients there is b 0 such that lim inf n max n b logn k n ak 1 n 1 a s since this is clearly incompatible with hadamard ostrowski gaps we conclude that the whole sequence of the counting measures n for the partial sums pn must converge to t with probability one if e log a 0 then the radius of convergence for our random power series is 0 almost surely a result of rosenbloom 25 now gives that there is a subsequence of partial sums with all zeros accumulating at the origin in fact his theorem xviii on pages 40 41 of 25 gives more precise information about zeros we apply essentially the same approach to prove a generalization of zero equidisribution criterion for sums of random power series spanned by various bases e g by orthogonal poly nomials sufficient conditions for almost sure equidistribution of zeros of random orthogonal polynomials were considered by shiffman and zelditch 26 and 27 bloom 6 and 7 bloom and shiffman 9 bloom and levenberg 8 bayraktar 3 and 4 and others pritsker 22 and 23 considered zero distribution for random polynomials spanned by general bases 2 2 equidistribution of zeros for random sums of poly nomials we now consider more general ensembles of random polynomials pn z n k 0 akbk z spanned by various bases bk k 0 let bk z k j 0 bj kz j where bj k c for all j and k and bk k 6 0 for all k be a polynomial basis so that deg bk k for all k n 0 given a compact set e c of positive logarithmic capacity cap e we denote the equilibrium measure of e by e which is a positive unit borel measure supported on the outer boundary of e see 24 for background it is known that under rather weak assumptions on the random coefficients ak and the basis polynomials bk associated with the set e the zeros of random polynomials pn are almost surely equidistributed according to the measure e this means that the counting measures n in zeros of pn converge weakly to e with probability one if e is a finite union of rectifiable curves and arcs we call the polynomials orthonormal with respect to the arclength measure ds by szego polynomials when e is a compact set of positive area we call the polynomials orthonormal with respect to the area measure da on e by bergman polynomials the basis of faber polynomials is defined for any compact set e with simply connected unbounded component of the complement c e the n th faber polynomial is the polynomial part of laurent expansion for n z at where is the canonical conformal mapping of onto c d normalized by and 0 theorem 2 1 suppose that e is the closure of a jordan domain g with analytic boundary l and that the basis bk k 0 is given either by szego or by bergman or by faber polynomials assume further that the random coefficients ak k 0 are non trivial i i d complex random variables the zero counting measures of pn z n k 0 akbk z converge almost surely to e if and only if e log a 0 our proofs show that the above result holds true for many other standard bases used to expand analytic functions e g for lagrange interpolation polynomial basis as well as for various extremal polynomials in the case of the unit disk and the faber basis our result reduces to that of ibragimov and zaporozhets in the proof of theorem 2 1 we obtain additional useful facts summarized below corollary 2 2 suppose that e is the closure of a jordan domain g with analytic boundary l and that the basis bk k 0 is given either by szego or by bergman or by faber polynomi als if ak k 0 are non trivial i i d complex random variables such that e log a 0 then the random polynomials pn z n k 0 akbk z converge almost surely to a random analytic function f that is not identically zero moreover lim n pn z 1 n z z 2 1 holds with probability one 3 note that 2 1 implies divergence of pn in with probability one so that l g is the natural boundary for the random series k 0 akbk z this phenomenon is well known in the case of standard power series see 21 for which the circle of convergence is almost surely the natural boundary more details and general results related to 2 1 may be found in 8 we know from the ibragimov zaporozhets theorem and theorem 2 1 that if e log a 0 then the equidistribution of zeros does not hold with probability one behavior of zeros for random power series in this case was studied in 17 and 19 however it is possible to find a polynomial basis and i i d coefficients for which there is still a subsequence of n that converges to t a s we give such a construction below recall that a positive measurable function l is called slowly varying at infinity if it is defined in a neighborhood of infinity and if for every t 0 we have lim x l tx l x 1 a random variable x is said to have a slowly varying tail if l x p x x is a slowly varying function for example if p x x h x log x for all large x r where 0 and limx h x c 0 then x has a slowly varying tail note that in this example e log x if and only if 1 proposition 2 3 let ak k 0 be a sequence of i i d random variables with a 0 1 almost surely consider the sequence of random polynomials pn z n k 0 ak z k 1 n n i if e loga 0 then n w t as n almost surely ii if e loga 0 and a 0 has a slowly varying tail then there is a subsequence such that nk w t a s if the random coefficients satisfy mild assumptions such as in theorem 2 1 then the zero counting measures of random polynomials pn z n k 0 akbk z converge almost surely to e for very general sets e and associated bases bk k 0 we direct the reader to the recent papers 8 3 4 and 22 23 and to references found therein however the necessity part of theorem 2 1 seems to be open in such general setting we end this section with conjectures related to this matter we assume here that g is an arbitrary jordan domain and e g conjecture 2 4 it is possible to construct sets e c with non analytic boundary and sequences of i i d random variables ak k 0 with e log a 0 such that for each basis of szego bergman or faber polynomials there is a subsequence of zero counting measures for pn z n k 0 akbk z satisfying nk w e a s our next conjecture is motivated by proposition 2 3 conjecture 2 5 it is possible to construct a weight function w 0 on t and a sequence of i i d random variables ak k 0 with e log a 0 such that for the basis of orthonormal on t polynomials with respect to this weight we have a subsequence of zero counting measures for pn z n k 0 akbk z satisfying nk w t a s an analogous construction should also exist for area orthonormal polynomials with respect to an appropriate weight function w 0 on d 4 3 proofs we start with auxiliary results on random coefficients the first lemma is well known but we prove it for the convenience of the reader lemma 3 1 if ak k 0 are non trivial independent and identically distributed complex random variables that satisfy e log a 0 then lim sup n an 1 n 1 a s 3 1 and lim sup n max 0 k n ak 1 n 1 a s 3 2 this follows from the borel cantelli lemmas stated below see e g 16 p 96 in a standard way borel cantelli lemmas let en n 1 be a sequence of arbitrary events i if n 1 p en then p en occurs infinitely often 0 ii if events en n 1 are independent and n 1 p en then p en i o 1 proof of lemma 3 1 for any fixed 0 define events en an e n n n then n 1 p en n 1 p log an n n 1 p 1 log a 0 n 1 e log a 0 hence p en occurs infinitely often 0 by the first borel cantelli lemma so that the com plementary event e cn must happen for all large n with probability 1 this means that an 1 n e for all sufficiently large n n almost surely we obtain that lim sup n an 1 n e a s and since 0 was arbitary this shows that lim sup n an 1 n 1 a s 3 3 on the other hand a 0 is non trivial so there exists c 0 such that p a 0 c 0 therefore since an are i i d n 1 p an c 3 4 using the second borel cantelli lemma it follows that with probability one there exist infinitely many n such that an c combining this with 3 3 we obtain 3 1 an elementary argument shows that 3 2 is a consequence of 3 1 5 lemma 3 2 if ak k 0 are non trivial i i d complex random variables then there is b 0 such that lim inf n max n b logn k n ak 1 n 1 a s 3 5 proof we use a modified idea of ferna ndez 13 in this proof let n n n n be a sequence of natural numbers that will be specified later consider mn max n n k n ak the statement lim inf n mn 1 n 1 a s is equivalent to p mn n i o 0 for all positive 1 the latter would follow from the first borel cantelli lemma if we show that n 1 p mn n for all positive 1 since our variables ak k 0 are i i d we have p mn n p a 0 n n as a 0 is non trivial we can find c 0 and p 0 1 such that p a 0 c p hence for any 1 there is n n p n such that p a 0 n p for all n n this gives n 1 p mn n n 1 p n provided p n 1 n 2 for large n it suffices to take n 2 log p logn to satisfy the latter condition we use the following result of grothmann 15 on the distribution of zeros of polynomials more details and applications of this result may be found in 1 let e c be a compact set of positive capacity such that c e is connected and regular the green function of with pole at is denoted by g z we use k for the supremum norm on a compact set k theorem g if a sequence of polynomials pn z deg pn n n satisfies lim sup n pn 1 ne 1 3 6 6 for any closed set k e lim n n k 0 3 7 and there is a compact set s such that lim inf n max z s 1 n log pn z g z 0 3 8 then the zero counting measures n of pn converge weakly to e as n we first give a short proof of the ibragimov zaporozhets equidistribution criterion for the zeros of partial sums pn z n k 0 akz k of a random power series with non trivial i i d complex random coefficients an n 0 if e log a 0 then the radius of convergence of our random series is almost surely 1 by lemma 3 1 on this event the series converges almost surely in the unit disk to a not identically zero analytic function so that 3 7 holds for any compact k d by hurwitz s theorem moreover 3 6 is also satisfied almost surely for e d by 3 2 and the estimate pn t n 1 max 0 k n ak if n do not converge to t then 3 8 does not hold with probability one for any compact set s in c d in particular for s z r r 1 and a subsequence nm m n we have with positive probability that lim sup m pnm 1 nm s r as g z log z hence with positive probability an 1 2 z r pnm z dz rn 1 qn cnm n nm for some c q 0 1 existence of such hadamard ostrowski gaps contradicts 3 5 of lemma 3 2 we conclude that n must converge to t with probability one if e log a 0 then the radius of convergence of the random power series is 0 almost surely on this event theorem xviii of rosenbloom 25 pp 40 41 gives a subsequence of pn whose zeros are equidistributed near the circles z an 1 n in particular all zeros of this subsequence tend to the origin as n proof of theorem 2 1 and of corollary 2 2 we have that e is the closure of a jordan do main g bounded by an analytic curve l with exterior it is well known that the conformal mapping 0 extends through l into g so that maps a domain r containing conformally onto z r for some r 0 1 in particular the level curves of denoted by l are contained in g for all r 1 l 1 l and l for 1 since g z log z l are also the level curves of the green function it is also known that in all three cases of polynomial bases we consider in this theorem we have that lim n bn z 1 n z 3 9 7 holds uniformly on compact subsets of r hence for any compact set k g we have cf 28 pp 290 and 338 and 29 section 2 3 that lim sup n bn 1 nk 1 if the assumption e log a 0 is satisfied then the random series must converge on compact subsets of g almost surely by 3 1 of lemma 3 1 furthermore its limit is almost surely an analytic function that cannot vanish identically because of 3 1 and uniqueness of series expansions in szego bergman and faber polynomials see 28 pp 293 and 340 and section 6 3 of 29 for these facts this proves the corresponding part of corollary 2 2 we also conclude that 3 7 holds for any compact k g by hurwitz s theorem note that 3 6 is also satisfied for e almost surely by 3 2 3 9 and the estimate pn e n k 0 ak bk e n 1 max 0 k n ak max 0 k n bk e as lim sup n max 0 k n bk e 1 n 1 if n do not converge to e a s then 3 8 cannot hold a s for any compact set s in we choose s lr with r 1 and find a subsequence nm m n such that lim sup m pnm 1 nm lr r 3 10 holds with positive probability note that all zeros of bn are contained outside r and hence inside lr for all large n by 3 9 this allows us to write an integral representation an 1 2 i lr pn z dz zbn z 3 11 which is valid for all large n n because pn z zbn z an z o 1 z 2 for z we now need more precise estimates for bn that follow from known asymptotic relations in r in the case of bergman polynomials carleman s asymptotic 14 p 12 implies that there are positive constants c 1 and c 2 that do not depend on n and z such that c 2 n n bn z c 1 n n z l r n n 3 12 similar estimates but without the factor n on both sides are true for szego and faber polynomials see 28 and 29 so that the following proof remains essentially the same for those bases we estimate from 3 11 and 3 12 with r that an lr 2 d pn lr c 2 nrn 8 where lr is the length of lr and d minz lr z it follows that pn 1 lr pn lr an bn lr pn lr 1 lr 2 d c 1 c 2 c pn lr n n applying this estimate repeatedly we obtain that pn k lr ck pn lr k n so that 3 11 yields an k lr 2 d pn k lr c 2 n k rn k lr 2 d ck pn lr c 2 n k rn k choosing sufficiently small 0 and using 3 10 we deduce from previous inequality that anm k qnm 0 k nm for some q 0 1 and all sufficiently large nm with positive probability the latter estimate clearly contradicts 3 5 of lemma 3 2 hence 3 8 holds for s lr with any r 1 and n converge weakly to e with probability one note that 3 8 for s lr with r 1 is equivalent to 2 1 indeed we have equality in 3 8 with lim instead of lim inf by bernstein walsh inequality and 3 6 see remark 1 2 of 1 p 51 for more details this concludes the proof of sufficiency part for theorem 2 1 as well as the proof of corollary 2 2 now we prove the necessity part of theorem 2 1 let us assume that e log a 0 recall the bounds of 3 12 for bergman polynomials and recall that similar bounds without the factor n are true for the szego and the faber polynomial bases it follows that for n large enough bn has all its zeros lying inside l we show below that for infinitely many n the zeros of pn all lie inside l where r 1 hence the counting measures n do not converge to e for the proof we follow a technique from 18 let us fix where r 1 to begin with we note that since ak are i i d random variables satisfying e log a 0 an application of the borel cantelli lemma gives us that lim sup k ak 1 k a s this means that with probability one for infinitely many values of n all three of the following estimates hold an 1 n max 1 k n 1 ak 1 k 3 13 an 1 n c 2 2 c 1 c 2 3 14 a 0 n 2 c 2 c 1 c 2 2 c 1 c 2 n 3 15 9 fix a large n for which 3 13 3 14 and 3 15 hold let z be in l and 1 k n 1 using inequality 3 12 and the bound 3 13 we estimate akbk z ak c 1 k k c 1 n an k n k c 1 n an n k n 3 16 furthermore 3 16 and 3 15 imply that with probability one a 0 b 0 a 1 b 1 z an 1 bn 1 z a 0 b 0 an 1 bn 1 z n 2 c 2 c 2 2 c 1 c 2 n c 1 n an n 1 n c 1 n an n 2 n c 1 n an n n 1 n n 2 c 2 c 2 2 c 1 c 2 n c 1 n c 1 n an n 1 an n 1 n 1 n 2 c 2 an n c 1 n an n 1 c 2 2 c 1 c 2 1 c 1 n n 2 c 2 an n c 2 n 2 an n 1 c 2 n an n anbn z we remark that in the above chain of inequalities we used 3 14 to go from the the fourth line to the fifth line and 3 12 in the last line having established the estimate a 0 b 0 a 1 b 1 z an 1 bn 1 z anbn z on l rouche s theorem now implies that pn has the same number of zeros as bn inside l in other words all the zeros of pn are inside l since this is true for infinitely many n and remembering that e is supported on l 1 e we conclude that with probability one the measures n do not converge to e proof of proposition 2 3 i since e log a 0 lemma 3 1 gives that lim supn an 1 n 1 a s coupled with our assumption that an 1 this gives lim n an 1 n 1 a s 3 17 next note that pn z anz n an 1 z n 1 a 1 z a 1 a 2 an dividing out by an we have that the zeros of pn coincide with those of qn z z n an 1 an zn 1 a 1 an z a 1 a 2 an an we now use the following theorem from 5 to study the limiting behavior of the zeros of qn 10 theorem bss let e c be a compact set cap e 0 if a sequence of polynomials pn z n k 0 ck nz k satisfy lim sup n pn 1 ne 1 and lim n cn n 1 n 1 cap e 3 18 and for any closed set a in the bounded components of c supp e we have lim n n a 0 3 19 then the zero counting measures n converge weakly to e as n it is known that 3 19 holds if every bounded component of c supp e contains a compact set k such that lim inf n pn 1 nk 1 3 20 see bloom 6 p 1706 continuing with our proof we observe that qn t 2 a 1 a 2 an an 2 nmax 1 i n ai an using 3 2 and 3 17 we obtain lim supn qn 1 n t 1 a s since qn is monic the condition on the leading coefficient is trivially satisfied and hence 3 18 holds a s in our case all that remains to check is 3 19 which in turn will follow from 3 20 by taking k 0 and using that our random variables are positive we have qn 0 1 n a 1 a 2 an an 1 n 1 a s hence 3 20 holds a s and theorem bss now yields that n w t a s ii let mn max 1 i nai then since a 0 has a slowly varying tail c f 11 a 1 a 2 an mn p 1 3 21 we also have that e log a 0 which implies that lim supk a 1 k k a s as before it follows that for some subsequence n a 1 nn max 1 k n 1 a 1 k k n n 3 22 since ak 1 a s this means that along this subsequence an mn now using 3 21 and choosing a further subsequence which we continue to call n we have that along the subsequence n a 1 a 2 an an 1 a s 3 23 11 as in the proof of part i it is enough to study the zeros of qn z z n an 1 an zn 1 a 1 an z a 1 a 2 an an we once again use theorem bss to study the limiting behavior of the zeros of qn n n to begin with we have qn t 2 a 1 a 2 an an now using 3 23 we see that along n lim supn qn 1 n t 1 since qn is monic the condition on the leading coefficient is trivially satisfied we show that 3 20 holds for k 0 indeed we have qn 0 1 n a 1 a 2 an an 1 n so that 3 20 holds a s by 3 23 therefore along the subsequence n we have n w t a s acknowledgement research of the first author was partially supported by the
