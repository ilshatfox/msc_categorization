radon measure on a locally compact hausdorff space x onto a closed or more generally a quasiclosed set a x that is a set which can be approximated in outer capacity by closed sets the setting is that of potentials with respect to a suitable symmetric function kernelg x x 0 following choquet 1959 we consider energy capacity not as a set function but as a functional acting on positive numerical functions on x the finiteness of the upper capacity of the function 1 ag is sufficient for the possibility of the sweeping in question 1 a denoting the indicator function of a and g the g potential of 1 introduction the thesis of frostman 14 marks the beginning of potential theory with respect to other kernels than the newtonian or greenian ones he considered the kernels x y n of order 0 n on rn studied particularly by his teacher m riesz as published in 28 1938 potential theory with respect to these kernels culminated with the book of landkof 23 potential theory with respect to much more general kernels began around 1940 with many contributions notably from the japanese school first by kametani ugaheri kunugui and ninomiya and from the french school around brelot h cartan choquet and deny a comprehensive study of the various principles in potential theory and their interrelations for rather general kernels was made by ohtsuka 27 1961 fundamental results by cartan 5 1945 on hilbert space aspects of classical potential theory were generalized by the present author 15 1960 to so called consistent function kernels on an arbitrary locally compact hausdorff space x that is on x x a continuation of that suitable for the study of balayage sweeping of a positive radon measure of finite energy on quasiclosed sets much as in cartan 6 for balayage on closed sets was worked out around 1970 in the setting of consistent function kernels and some underlying general aspects were treated in 18 and 19 1971 but the actual potential theoretic aspects were left unpublished until now here a

capacity as a functional and of balayage on quasiclosed sets with respect to a consistent function kernel is presented this will be applied in ongoing joint work with zorii 21 i thank natalia zorii for encouraging me to publish the present part of my old material from 1970 now including balayage of measures of infinite energy using choquet 8 and for going through the entire manuscript thoroughly and constructively in the present study we consider a kernel g on a nonvoid locally compact spacex that is a lower semicontinuous l s c function g x x 0 in the absence of other indication g shall be symmetric and strictly positive on the diagonal further requirements will be listed on the way we denote by m m x the cone of all positive radon measures on x the potential g of a measure m is defined by g x g x y d y our main purpose is to extend the gauss variational method passing first from measures in particular equilibrium measures on a compact set k to measures on a quasicompact set that is a set a x such that inf c a k k compact k x 0 1 1 where c denotes the outer energy capacity as a set function defined on all subsets of x cf e g 15 section 2 5 the main step is to pass from indicator functions of compact subsets of x to functions of class h 0 that is functions f x 0 such that inf c f h h h 0 h f 0 where h 0 denotes the cone of all finite upper semicontinuous u s c functions h 0 of compact support inx and where c is the extension of the above outer energy capacity of sets to a functional likewise denoted by c and termed the upper energy capacity defined on the cone f of all functions f x 0 cf 19 and eqs 2 1 through 2 3 below while this latter step is irrelevant for the study of equilibrium it becomes very useful for the study in section 4 with more assumptions on g of balayage of a measure on x onto a suitable set a x in the first place on a quasiclosed set a that is a set like a quasicompact set but with compact replaced by closed in 1 1 briefly speaking this usefulness is because the upper energy capacity c 1 ag supposed finite governs the game of balayage in section 2 we study the capacitary measures for a function f from the above class h 0 these capacitary measures are those measures on x which maximize the gauss integral 2 f g d as ranges over the cone e of positive measures of finite energy cf theorem 2 3 their potentials in particular possess the following properties g f q e on x and g f a e 1 2 symmetric function kernels and sweeping of measures 3 q e quasi everywhere meaning everywhere off some set of zero outer energy capacity compare with remark 2 4 section 3 deals with a dual notion of energy capacity and corresponding upper and lower dual capacity denoted and respectively the former being defined for f f by f inf g d 1 2 e g f q e interpreted as if there is no such measure this upper dual capacity is a particular case of an encombrement in the sense of choquet 12 it is easily shown that g g d 1 2 for any e lemma 3 3 we now assume that the kernel g is consistent and positive semi definite definitions 3 4 and 3 10 thus the potential g of every positive measure of finite energy g d is of class h 0 and every function f f with f is majorized q e by a function of class h 0 lemma 3 14 consistency of a strictly positive definite kernel amounts to the cone e of positive measures of finite energy being complete in the strong topology on e induced by the energy norm topology on the prehilbert space e of all signed measures of finite energy and such that this strong topology on e is finer than the induced vague that is weak topology 15 section 3 3 as observed by h cartan 5 the prehilbert space e is incomplete in the case of the newtonian kernel on rn under the stated hypotheses capacity and dual capacity are the same in particular c corollary 3 13 for every f h 0 there exist measures e satisfying 1 2 above any such measure is called a capacitary measure for f and the class m f of all these measures is a nonvoid convex subset of e compact in the vague topology on x theorem 3 15 of course if g is strictly positive definite then there is only one capacitary measure for f in any case the upper capacity c is sequentially order continuous from below c f sup n c fn for any increasing sequence of functions fn f corollary 3 13 it follows by choquet s capacitability theorem 11 that every h 0 suslin function f f is c capacitable theorem 3 17 section 3 closes with a discussion of upper capacitary measures for an arbitrary function f f with c f by reducing this to the previous case f h 0 in section 4 the above is applied under additional hypotheses on x and g to establish balayage of any radon measure m on a quasiclosed set a such that 1 ag h 0 this requirement is fulfilled lemma 4 2 if c 1 ag and if g is quasicontinuous in the sense that there exists for any 0 an open set v with c v such that the restriction of f to v x v is continuous in the extended sense 4 bent fuglede for simplicity of statements we now assume that the consistent and positive definite kernel g is strictly positive definite so that f 1 ag h 0 has just one capacitary measure which we denote by a similarly for a quasicompact set a f 1 a has just one capacitary measure in particular equilibrium measure in the presence of the maximum principle denoted a if has finite energy then g h 0 by definition of consistency and hence g is indeed quasicontinuous 19 theorem 2 6 we must further assume that g satisfies the domination principle in order to pass from g g a e in 1 2 to g g everywhere on x where now is a then a has the desired properties of the sweeping of on a it is desirable to remove the above hypothesis that e returning to any radon measure we establish the quasicontinuity of g by using a result by choquet 8 about quasicontinuity of g for any radon measure on x supposed compact when g is l s c and satisfies the continuity principle of evans and vasilesco as noted in 8 the compactness assumption is easily removed however quasicontinuity is understood in 8 with respect to the outer capacity g cap see eq 4 1 below which is smaller than the outer energy capacity assuming g symmetric but the two are equal if g satisfies the maximum principle in this way we obtain our result on balayage of a measure on a quasiclosed set a with c 1 ag theorem 4 12 replacing g by the constant function 1 and the hypothesis of the domina tion principle by that of the maximum principle this leads to a corresponding result about the equilibrium measure on a quasiclosed set a x of finite up per capacity c a remark 4 14 as emphasized by natalia zorii personal communication the requirement that c a be finite is not necessary for the existence of an equilibrium measure on a cf 6 p 277 20 p 74 29 this requirement however is necessary and sufficient for the existence of an equi librium measure of finite energy and our method is confined to equilibrium measures and swept measures a of finite energy dropping now the hypothesis that a be quasiclosed in these two results on sweeping resp equilibrium we obtain corresponding results on upper sweep ing resp outer equilibrium theorem 4 15 resp corollary 4 17 simply by passing from a to any quasiclosure a of a and noting that c 1 a g c 1 ag and hence 1 a g h 0 resp c a c a whence a is quasicompact a quasiclosure of a set a x is defined as a quasiclosed set a containing a which is minimal with these properties up to a set of zero outer capacity for details see the beginning of section 4 5 dropping instead the requirement that g in theorem 4 12 resp remark 4 14 satisfy the domination principle resp the maximum principle we loose the inequality g a g resp g a 1 everywhere on x and therefore only have pseudobalayage instead of balayage theorem 4 10 resp capacitary measures instead of equilibrium measures theorem 4 13 these two theorems symmetric function kernels and sweeping of measures 5 are valid e g for the riesz kernels x y n on rn of any order 0 n whereas we have actual balayage and equilibrium for 0 2 only 2 an extension of the gauss variational method 2 1 definitions and preliminaries let x be a non void locally compact space a positive function kernel on x is a lower semicontinuous l s c function g x x 0 in the absence of other indication we shall furthermore assume throughout except in section 4 2 that g is symmetric that is g x y g y x for x y x and that g is strictly positive on the diagonal that is g x x 0 for x x for any positive radon measure m m x define the potential g x 0 and the energy g d 0 of by g x g x y d y g d g x y d x d y for brevity we may write for g d 1 2 define e m e 1 m 1 remark 2 1 the requirement that g be strictly positive on the diagonal is equivalent to e 1 being vaguely bounded or equivalently vaguely compact see 15 lemma 2 5 1 it follows that 0 for any non zero m to see this take z supp and an open neighborhood v of z such that g 0 on v v possible since g z z 0 and g is l s c then 2 v v g x y d x d y 0 the mutual energy of two measures m is defined as g d g d g x y d x d y 0 the potential the energy and the mutual energy are l s c functions of the respective variables m being given the vague topology 15 lemma 2 2 1 let f f x denote the convex cone of all functions x 0 let g denote the convex subcone of f consisting of all l s c functions x 0 let h 0 denote the convex subcone of f consisting of all finite and upper semicontinuous u s c functions x 0 of compact support in x then c 0 g h 0 is the further convex subcone of f formed by all finite continuous positive functions of compact support in x referring to 19 section 5 we shall consider the enveloping capacity for the set e 1 of measures this capacity c is called the energy capacity with respect to the kernel g explicitly the functional c c 0 0 is defined by c max e 1 max d e g d 1 2 1 6 bent fuglede c 0 if we want to specify the kernel g in question we may write cg for c as a functional on c 0 the energy capacity c is finite valued increasing and sublinear that is subadditive and positive homogeneous 19 section 5 4 applicable because g is strictly positive on the diagonal cf remark 2 1 the extensions of this functional to functions of class h 0 or g are defined 19 section 4 2 by c h inf c c 0 h h h 0 c g sup c c 0 g g g the expression 2 1 for c with c 0 remains valid with replaced by h h 0 19 theorem 5 5 see also theorem 2 2 below define the lower and the upper energy capacity of a function f f by c f sup c h h h 0 h f sup f d e 1 2 2 c f inf c g g g g f sup f d e 1 2 3 cf 19 section 5 5 for the latter relation in 2 2 and 2 3 in the latter equal ity 2 2 it suffices to admit measures e 1 of compact support contained in f 0 19 section 5 5 remark these two functionals c and c on f are increasing and positive homogeneous and c is countably subadditive 19 p 21 note that c is an upper capacity also in the sense of 19 definition 3 1 two functions f 1 f 2 f are said to be c equivalent if c f 1 f 2 0 or equivalently if f 1 f 2 q e cf 19 p 6 corollary 2 it is understood that f 1 f 2 at points where f 1 f 2 we say that f is c capacitable if c f c f in which case we may write c f in place of c f or c f and briefly term c f the energy capacity of f define h 0 and g as the closures of h 0 and g respectively in the c metric topology that is the topology on f defined by the pseudometric e cart f 1 f 2 7 c f 1 f 2 we always define equivalently for f f f h 0 inf c f h h h 0 h f 0 f g inf c g f g g g f 0 by 19 section 3 2 every function of class h 0 or g is c capacitable and so is therefore every function of class h 0 or g see 19 lemma 4 6 furthermore c h for any h h 0 and hence for any h h 0 this is because any h h 0 is majorized by some c 0 and hence c h c also every function of class g is measurable and every function of class h 0 is integrable with respect to any e 19 corollary 6 1 symmetric function kernels and sweeping of measures 7 the following further extension of 2 1 from functions of class h 0 now to functions of class h 0 is crucial for the present study it is a particular case of 19 theorem 6 3 theorem 2 2 for any function f h 0 c f max e 1 f max f d e g d 1 if c f 0 then every maximizing measure for c f in theorem 2 2 clearly has energy 1 the expression for c f in the theorem therefore remains valid if e 1 is replaced by its boundary e 1 e 1 identifying a set a x with its indicator function 1 a f we write c k c 1 k for compact k then c k 2 is the usual energy capacity of k cf e g 15 eq 1 and note 1 p 162 denoting by c a 2 and c a 2 the usual inner and outer energy capacity of an arbitrary set a it follows that c a c 1 a and c a c 1 a we have the usual notions nearly everywhere n e and quasi everywhere n e that is everywhere except in some set e with c e 0 resp c e 0 according to 19 lemma 2 4 the sets a such that 1 a h 0 are the quasicompact sets see 1 1 2 2 gauss variation for a function f h 0 the key to the rest of this paper is the extension of the gauss variational method from the classical case dealing with compact sets k x see e g 15 theorem 2 5 to dealing with functions of class h 0 or even h 0 in particular with indicator functions of quasicompact sets the gauss integral associated with a given function f h 0 is defined as the following function of a variable measure e 2 f g d 2 f d 2 which is finite and only depends on the c equivalence class of f h 0 because does not charge the sets of zero outer capacity we say that a measure m is carried by or concentrated on a set a x if a is locally negligible let e a consist of all e that are carried by a theorem 2 3 for any function f h 0 we have c f 2 max e 2 f g d max e 2 f d 2 2 4 c f 2 max f d e g f a e 2 5 the maximizing measures are the same in the two cases 2 4 and 2 5 they form a nonvoid vaguely compact subclass m f of e which only depends on 8 bent fuglede the c equivalence class of f each measure m f is carried by f 0 and has the following properties a g f q e b g f a e c f d 2 c f 2 the measures m f are called the capacitary measures for f proof let first m f consist of all e maximizing the gauss integral over e provided such maximizing measures exist in proving 2 4 and the equations c the latter for m f we may leave out the trivial case c f 0 in which f d 0 for every e by the latter relation in 2 2 or 2 3 or by theorem 2 2 and so the gauss integral equals 2 whose maximum over e is 0 observe that then m f 0 for if 6 0 then 0 by remark 2 1 we are thus left with the case c f 0 where we only need to consider non zero competing measures in 2 4 by normalization write t 1 with t 1 e 1 the gauss integral at e then becomes 2 t f d 1 t 2 f d 1 2 t f d 1 2 2 6 for variable t 0 and fixed 1 e 1 this expression attains its greatest value f d 1 2 at t f d 1 for the corresponding measure t 1 we have f d t 2 2 when now varying 1 in e 1 and maximizing f d 1 2 this leads to the greatest value of the gauss integral over e and that greatest value equals c f 2 by theorem 2 2 relation 2 4 has thus been completely proved at the same time we have established c for every m f denote by m 1 f the class of all measures 1 e 1 equivalently 1 e 1 which maximize f d 1 over e 1 we show that m f c f m 1 f 2 7 again we may clearly assume that c f 0 if m f then 1 t 1 m 1 f for t c f in fact 1 e 1 and c f 2 f d 1 2 2 by c so that 1 indeed belongs to m 1 f according to theorem 2 2 conversely if 1 m 1 f then t 1 m f for t f d 1 c f in fact e and the gauss integral at equals f d 1 2 c f 2 by 2 6 it follows from 2 7 that m f is vaguely compact even if c f 0 and hence m f 0 and that every measure m f is carried by f 0 because m 1 f has these properties for the vague compactness of m 1 f note that the function 7 f on e 1 is vaguely u s c by 19 theorem 6 2 whence symmetric function kernels and sweeping of measures 9 m 1 f e 1 f c f is vaguely closed and therefore vaguely compact along with e 1 remark 2 1 and every m 1 f is carried by f 0 by theorem 2 2 and 19 lemma 6 5 because e 1 is strictly hereditary in the sense that for every e 1 and every m with we have g d 1 in fact g d g d g d g d by remark 2 1 to establish a and b also if c f 0 consider any measure m f for any e we have t m for all t 0 and hence 2 f d t t 2 2 f d 2 also if t for f d and f d are finite thus 2 t f g d t 2 2 0 and therefore f d g d for all e according to 19 lemma 2 3 f g is of class h 0 and hence integrable for every e and c capacitable since f g d 0 for any e as shown above we thus have f g d 0 for any e f g 0 and clearly even for arbitrary e hence c f g c f g 0 by the latter expression in 2 2 and we conclude by 19 lemma 1 3 b that indeed f g q e having thus established a we get in particular g f a e for every e because g f 0 on account of the latter inequality 2 3 hence g f a e since by c g d f d we thus get g f a e which proves b it remains to establish 2 5 and the fact that the maximizing measures in 2 5 form the class m f for any competing measure in 2 5 we find by integration with respect to that 2 f d and hence f d 2 f d 2 c f 2 2 8 on the other hand every m f is a competing measure in 2 5 by b and gives the value c f 2 to f d by c on account of 2 8 we thus see that 2 5 holds and every m f is maximizing in 2 5 conversely every 10 bent fuglede maximizing measure for 2 5 has g d f d and hence gives the value c f 2 to the gauss integral 2 f d g d f d c f 2 whence m f remark 2 4 the properties a c characterize m f uniquely up to c equivalence namely if e possess a c then m f in the above theorem property c alone characterizes m f within e for if e has property c then m f because 2 f d 2 2 c f 2 so that maximizes the gauss integral judging from the classical theory one might expect that the key properties a and b together might characterize m f but this does not seem to be the case in the general setting of theorem 2 3 however if g is consistent definition 3 4 and positive semi definite definition 3 10 then a and b together imply that m f see theorem 3 15 3 the dual energy capacity 3 1 upper and lower dual energy capacity we shall study a kind of dual energy capacity and corresponding upper and lower dual capacity f 0 this concept is a particular case of an encombrement in the sense of choquet 12 it will be shown in corollary 3 13 that c and c if the kernel g is consistent and positive semi definite see the next two subsections for these concepts to begin with g is just required to be symmetric l s c and strictly positive on the diagonal as stated in the beginning of section 2 with any function f f that is f x 0 we associate the following two convex subsets of e f e c f g 0 e g f q e f e c f g 0 e g d f d for all e e g f n e here indicates equality provided that f is measurable for every e of compact support contained in f 0 however if f f is arbitrary then the relation should be replaced by these and the alternative symmetric function kernels and sweeping of measures 11 expression for f are immediate by 19 sections 1 3 and 7 4 because g is l s c and hence e measurable that is measurable with respect to every measure in e for the second representation of f we use the latter expression 2 2 clearly f f for f 1 f 2 f the relations f 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 3 1 hold when f 1 f 2 q e hence f and f only depend on the c equivalence class of f f the latter relation 3 1 likewise holds under the weaker hypothesis that f 1 d f 2 d for every e it follows that if f 2 is e measurable then the latter relation 3 1 holds if c f 1 f 2 0 thus in particular if f 1 f 2 n e cf again 19 theorem 7 4 definition 3 1 the upper and lower dual capacity of a function f f are defined by f inf f f inf f respectively interpreted as if f resp f is void the terms upper resp lower are justified here by theorem 3 12 below where g is assumed to be consistent in the sense of definition 3 4 resp consistent and positive semi definite cf definition 3 10 the values f and f only depend on the c equivalence class of f since f f we have f f in case of equality we may denote the common value by f the dual capacity of f either functional f or f is positive homogeneous and if f 1 f 2 q e then f 1 f 2 and f 1 f 2 when f 2 is e measurable the latter inequality holds if just c f 1 f 2 0 in particular if f 1 f 2 n e cf the comments to 3 1 above lemma 3 2 let f h 0 then f f and hence f f f furthermore f c f proof from f h 0 follows f g h 0 for any m by 19 lemma 2 3 because g g g hence c f g c f g and so f f then also denoted f by theorem 2 3 a a capacitary measure m f belongs to f which in view of theorem 2 3 c yields f c f lemma 3 3 for any measure e we have g g proof since g we have g to prove that g note that for any g we have g d g d for all e and hence 2 g d g d g d g d 2 12 bent fuglede 3 2 consistent kernel definition 3 4 a symmetric kernel g x x 0 is said to be consistent if for every measure e the following two equivalent conditions are fulfilled i g h 0 ii the vaguely l s c function 7 g d considered on e 1 is finite and vaguely u s c and hence vaguely continuous since g g the equivalence of i and ii follows from 19 theorem 6 2 property ii is the same as property cw in 15 lemma 3 4 1 where g is supposed to be positive semi definite cf definition 3 10 below and for any positive definite symmetric kernel g property cw is equivalent with the property c of consistency defined in 15 p 167 cf 16 remark 3 5 suppose that g is consistent for any function g g we have g g g because g g is of class g and hence c capacitable for any measure e by 19 lemma 2 3 note that g h 0 by definition 3 4 i we then have g c g the equality holds by lemma 3 3 the inequality holds by lemma 3 2 in view of definition 3 4 i and equality prevails here if and only if g in addition is positive semi definite definition 3 10 theorem 3 6 convergence theorem suppose that g is consistent for any vague cluster point e for a sequence of measures n e with bounded energy norms n 6 a for some finite constant a we have g lim inf n g n q e equality prevails q e in case n vaguely as n proof such a cluster point exists by remark 2 1 for any p q n write n g lim inf n g n np g 1 p lim inf n g n np q g 1 p inf n q g n then n p np np q np q and in view of the countable subadditivity of c it therefore suffices to prove that c np q 0 for any p q by definition 3 4 all g n are of class h 0 and so is therefore infn q g n for each q by 19 theorem 2 2 in particular infn q g n is quasi u s c by 19 theorem 2 5 b for the notion of quasi u s c functions see 18 section 3 or section 4 1 below since g 1 p is symmetric function kernels and sweeping of measures 13 l s c it follows that each np q is quasiclosed and in fact quasicompact being a subset of a g q 1 p which is quasicompact according to 19 lemma 2 4 because 1 a pg q hence 1 a h 0 again by 19 theorem 2 5 b being quasicompact np q is c capacitable with finite c capacity cf the version of the proof of 19 lemma 4 6 for sets instead of functions thus it remains to show that c np q 0 let e have compact support contained in np q cf the text following 2 2 and 2 3 we conclude that 0 as follows g 1 p d inf n q g n d inf n q g n d inf n q g d n lim inf n g d n g d g d where the last inequality holds since g is consistent cf ii in definition 3 4 according to which the function 7 g d on ae 1 is vaguely continuous and since is a vague cluster point of n ae 1 g d becomes a cluster point of g d n this proves the former assertion of the theorem the latter assertion follows in view of the lower semicontinuity of the kernel g theorem 3 7 suppose that g is consistent for any f f such that f resp f is finite the infima in definition 3 1 are attained f min f f min f proof for the case of f choose a sequence of measures n f so that n f and denote by a vague cluster point for the vaguely bounded sequence n cf remark 2 1 by application of the above convergence the orem we have f moreover limn n f and so indeed f for the case of f let a f then ae 1 f 6 the con sistency of g means that the mapping 7 g d g d of ae 1 into 0 is finite valued and vaguely continuous for every e consider any vaguely convergent net on ae 1 f and denote by 0 its vague limit then 0 lim inf a using the second expression for f in its definition we have g d f d for any e and hence by the stated continuity g 0 d lim g d f d thus 0 f and indeed 0 ae 1 f because 0 a it follows that ae 1 f is vaguely closed and in fact vaguely compact along with ae 1 cf remark 2 1 the vaguely l s c function 7 therefore attains its infimum 0 when considered on ae 1 f that infimum is also the infimum of considered on all of f because a 0 on f ae 1 14 bent fuglede remark 3 8 suppose that g is consistent for any f f with f resp f we denote by f f f f f f the nonvoid equivalence class of measures of minimal energy in the convex subset f resp f of e cf 15 lemma 4 1 1 we may write f in place of f or f if these are equal theorem 3 9 suppose that g is consistent the upper dual energy capacity is sequentially order continuous from below that is sup n fn sup n fn for any increasing sequence of functions fn f the lower dual energy ca pacity is sequentially order continuous from below on e measurable func tions that is sup n fn sup n fn for any increasing sequence of e measurable functions fn f proof consider first the case of and write f supn fn in proving the non trivial inequality f supn fn we may suppose that the sequence fn is bounded by theorem 3 7 there exists n fn such that n fn by application of the convergence theorem theorem 3 6 we obtain a vague cluster point e of the sequence n such that g lim inf n g n lim inf n fn f q e that is f it follows that f lim sup n n lim sup n fn sup n fn the proof is similar in the case of now with quasi everywhere replaced by nearly everywhere while invoking the measurability requirement cf the last representation of f in the beginning of the present section 3 3 positive definite kernel definition 3 10 a symmetric kernel g x x 0 is positive definite if the following three equivalent conditions are fulfilled for every e i g d ii 2 g d g d g d iii c g hence actually c g symmetric function kernels and sweeping of measures 15 note that i obviously implies ii the converse the cauchy schwarz inequality is of course obtained by replacing with t and with t 1 0 t and next minimizing over t in iii g g is c capacitable and the opposite inequality in iii holds for every symmetric kernel g because c g g d if 0 noting that then e 1 from i applied with e 1 follows by 2 2 the stated inequality in iii c g c g conversely from the stated inequality in iii it follows that g d c g which implies i since we may suppose in i that 6 0 and hence 6 0 cf remark 2 1 in either condition i or ii it suffices to consider measures e whose supports are compact and disjoint 9 lemme 1 if g is positive definite we denote by e the prehilbert space of all signed radon measures on x for which g d taking for inner product of measures e the mutual energy g d with g defined a e by the same formula as in case 0 whereby g becomes integrable we keep the notation for the corresponding energy seminorm on e a positive definite kernel g is said to be strictly positive definite or to satisfy the energy principle if for any e 0 implies 0 or equivalently if g 0 a e implies 0 but here it may no longer be sufficient to consider measures e of compact support thus a positive definite kernel g is strictly positive definite if and only if the energy seminorm is a norm in the affirmative case the energy norm topology on the prehilbert space e and its induced topology on e is also called the strong topology our standard hypothesis that g be strictly positive on the diagonal is au tomatically fulfilled if g is strictly positive definite in fact if g x x 0 for some x x then x has finite energy g x d x g x x 0 and so x 0 which is impossible as mentioned in section 1 consistency of a strictly positive definite kernel amounts to e being strongly complete and such that the strong topology on e is finer than the induced vague topology 15 section 3 3 lemma 3 11 each of the following inequalities holds if and only if g is positive definite i c f f for every f h 0 hence actually c f f even for f h 0 in view of lemma 3 2 ii c f f for every f f iii c f f for every f f proof recall from lemma 3 2 that c f f for any f h 0 if g is positive definite we have for any f the equality c f g 0 and hence the inequalities c f c g invoking also 19 theorem 7 4 and definition 3 10 iii this establishes iii in the present lemma and ii is obtained similarly invoking now 19 lemma 1 3 b conversely ii or 16 bent fuglede iii implies i in view of lemma 3 2 finally i implies that g is positive definite in fact for any e we have by 2 2 c g sup c h h h 0 h g because c h h for every competing h we now justify the terms lower and upper dual capacity cf 2 2 and 2 3 theorem 3 12 suppose that g is consistent and positive definite for any f f we have f sup h h h 0 h f c f 3 2 f inf g g g g f c f 3 3 f min g g g g f q e 3 4 proof consider first the case of f recall from remark 3 5 that g g for any g g or just g g since h 0 is stable under supremum of finite families in particular upper directed so is h h h 0 h f for any h h there exists by theorem 3 7 h h we may assume that the numbers h h remain bounded say a for h h by remark 2 1 the net h h h has a vague cluster point ae 1 as at the end of the proof of theorem 3 6 we invoke the vague continuity of the function 7 g d on ae for any e it follows that g d lim inf h h g h d lim h h h d f d where the latter inequality follows from h h h hence g h d h d also note that the net h d h h is increasing this shows that f by the vague lower semicontinuity of energy lim sup h h h lim h h h sup h h h and hence f suph h h f f this leads to 3 2 f sup h h h sup h h c h c f because h c h for h h 0 by lemma 3 2 next consider 3 4 we may assume that f by theorem 3 7 f min f min g g f q e in view of lemma 3 3 and the definition of f thus there exists e with g f q e and g f for any g g with g f q e we have g f because f only depends on the c equivalence class of f since g g it follows that f g inf g g g g f q e symmetric function kernels and sweeping of measures 17 and this infimum is attained by g g which proves 3 4 having fixed f we have c f g 0 and therefore for any 0 there exists a function g g with c g such that f g g writing g g g g we infer that f g when g is positive definite the seminorm is subadditive and it easily follows that so is hence g g g c g f in view of lemmas 3 2 and 3 3 because g c g by 3 2 and because f since f by varying this implies the equality in 3 3 and that equality implies the inequality in 3 3 by inserting g c g and invoking the definition of upper energy capacity c f corollary 3 13 suppose that g is consistent and positive definite then c f f and c f f for any f f hence c c f 0 are sequentially order continuous from below on e measurable functions in the case of c c sup n fn sup n c fn c sup n fn sup n c fn for any increasing sequence of functions fn f e measurable functions fn f in the case of c the identity c follows by combining the inequality c in 3 2 for g consistent with the inequality c obtained in lemma 3 11 iii for g positive definite the identity c now follows from 3 3 hence the remaining assertions follow from the corresponding sequential order continuity of and theorem 3 9 for the concepts of quasi u s c resp quasi l s c functions of class f we refer to 18 section 3 or see section 4 1 below it follows from the definitions that a set a x is quasiclosed resp quasiopen if and only if the indicator function 1 a is quasi u s c resp quasi l s c lemma 3 14 suppose that g is consistent and positive definite a every function f f such that c f has a majorant of class h 0 if moreover f is quasi u s c then f h 0 b every set a x such that c a is contained in some quasi compact set if moreover a is quasiclosed then a is quasicompact proof a since f c f there exists f thus g f q e and g h 0 by definition 3 4 by redefining g on the set g f we obtain the desired majorant of f of class h 0 if f itself is quasi u s c then f h 0 by 19 theorem 2 5 b b since c 1 a 1 a has by a a majorant h h 0 then h is quasi u s c again by 19 theorem 2 5 b it follows by 18 lemma 3 3 that the set h h 1 is quasiclosed and contains a hence the function 1 h is 18 bent fuglede quasi u s c and h since h h 0 it follows by the latter assertion a that 1 h h 0 which by 19 lemma 2 4 means that the set h which contains a is quasicompact if a itself is quasiclosed then 1 a is quasi u s c and majorized by h h 0 and it follows by the second assertion a that 1 a h 0 and again by 19 lemma 2 4 that a is quasicompact 3 4 further properties of measures m f let us now return to theorem 2 3 and establish further properties of the capacitary measures m f now with g consistent and positive definite we shall repeatedly use the above lemma 3 14 theorem 3 15 suppose that g is consistent and positive definite let f h 0 or equivalently f is quasi u s c with c f the class m f of all capacitary measures for f is a nonvoid vaguely compact convex subset of e and consists of all measures of class e satisfying a and b in theorem 2 3 these measures which are carried by f 0 have in addition to a b c in theorem 2 3 the following properties d m f f and f is an equivalence class in e in particular if g is strictly positive definite then m f and f reduce to the same single capacitary measure proof for any measure e satisfying a and b we have c f 2 c g 2 g d f d the inequality by a the former equality by definition 3 10 iii and the latter equality by b on the other hand c f 2 f d by 2 5 because e and g f a e by b thus is maximizing in 2 5 and hence indeed m f according to theorem 2 3 concerning d for the equality c f f see lemma 3 11 i it follows from a that m f f since by c c f f for any m f we thus have m f f cf remark 3 8 where it is noted that f is an equivalence class in e convexity of m f amounts to that of m 1 f cf theorem 2 3 which reduces to that of e 1 a consequence of positive definiteness of g this establishes d 3 5 capacitability of suslin functions theorem 3 16 suppose that g is consistent and positive definite then the following two assertions hold a for any decreasing net of u s c functions h f with c h we have c inf h inf c h symmetric function kernels and sweeping of measures 19 b for any decreasing sequence of quasi u s c functions hn f with c hn we have c inf n hn inf n c hn proof assertion a follows from 19 theorem 3 6 a because c h and hence each h has a majorant of class h 0 according to the former assertion in lemma 3 14 a so that 19 theorem 2 5 b applies for b of the present theorem the latter assertion of lemma 3 14 a shows that hn h 0 and hence 19 theorem 3 6 c applies theorem 3 17 suppose that g is consistent and positive definite every h 0 suslin function f f is c capacitable proof this follows from the sequential order continuity of c from below on functions of class f corollary 3 13 together with the sequential order conti nuity of c from above on functions of class h 0 theorem 3 16 b we merely have to apply choquet s capacitability theorem in its abstract form 10 cf 19 section 1 6 and remark 2 in section 4 5 3 6 upper capacitary measures throughout this subsection it is assumed that g is consistent and positive definite and also that x has a countable base of open sets the second axiom of countability passing from the given function f h 0 in theorems 2 3 and 3 15 to an arbitrary function f f of finite upper capacity c f we introduce the upper capacitary measures for f for any f f define f f is quasi u s c f q e clearly f is convex and stable under countable infimum furthermore f is a union of c equivalence classes in f and only depends on the c equivalence class of f in f by corollary 3 13 c is sequentially order continuous from below since x has a countable base of open sets it therefore follows from 18 theorem 3 4 that f has a quasi u s c upper envelope f that is a quasiminimal element of f explicitly f is an element of f which is majorized q e by any element of f if c f that is f then every quasi u s c envelope f of f is of class h 0 being majorized q e by g h 0 for any f 6 cf lemma 3 14 a any two quasi u s c envelopes of f are c equivalent definition 3 18 let x have a countable base of open sets and let g be consistent and positive definite let f f and suppose that c f by an upper capacitary measure for f we understand a measure e whose potential has the following two properties f denoting a chosen upper envelope of f a g f q e that is g f 20 bent fuglede b g f a e we denote by m f the set of all upper capacitary measures for f theorem 3 19 suppose that x has a countable base and that g is consistent and positive definite let f f and suppose that c f for any quasi u s c envelope f of f we have c f c f f f m f m f where m f denotes the nonvoid vaguely compact convex set of all capacitary measures for f h 0 cf theorems 2 3 and 3 15 now with f replaced by f proof with f we have g f and f c f remark 3 8 and corollary 3 13 since f is a quasiminimal function in f and g f it follows that g f q e hence c f c g c f c f and so indeed c f c f next let f and f f f here f f f the latter equality by lemma 3 2 thus f and is even energy minimizing in f it therefore follows by 15 lemma 4 1 1 applied to f that 2 2 2 c f 2 c f 2 0 and hence any in f is equivalent to some in the equivalence class f cf theorem 3 15 d with f replaced by f as f is an equivalence class as well remark 3 8 this yields f f finally let m f then a in definition 3 18 implies the stronger inequality g f q e as in the beginning of the proof in view of 2 3 and this together with b in the same definition implies m f so that m f m f in view of the characterization of m f in theorem 3 15 with f replaced by f the converse inclusion is obvious and so indeed m f m f we omit the analogous consideration of the lower capacitary measures for f 4 balayage sweeping on a quasiclosed set for sweeping of a positive measure not necessarily of finite energy onto a suitable set a x we shall apply theorem 3 15 to the function f 1 ag for that purpose we need that f h 0 in particular that c 1 ag 4 1 quasicontinuous functions a map f of a subset u of x into a topo logical space t is said to be quasicontinuous with respect to outer energy capacity c if there exists for any 0 a set v u with c v such that the restriction of f to u v is continuous in the extended sense if e g t 0 one may then clearly take v open quasi u s c functions of symmetric function kernels and sweeping of measures 21 class f are defined similarly replacing continuous by u s c twice as noted earlier a set a x is quasiclosed if and only if 1 a f is quasi u s c remark 4 1 if g is consistent and e then g h 0 definition 3 4 and in particular g is quasi u s c by 19 theorem 2 5 b and even quasi continuous and hence 1 ag is quasi u s c for any quasiclosed set a x lemma 4 2 suppose that g is consistent and positive definite let be a measure on x such that g is quasicontinuous and let a x be quasiclosed write f 1 ag a if c f then f h 0 b if x has a countable base then f is c capacitable c f c f c f proof clearly f is quasi u s c a since c f we have f c f corollary 3 13 and hence there exists a measure e such that g f q e and c f then g h 0 definition 3 4 by redefining h g on a set of zero outer c capacity whereby h remains of class h 0 we achieve that h f everywhere in x and since f is quasi u s c we conclude from 19 theorem 2 5 b that indeed f h 0 b having a countable base x is the union of an increasing sequence of compact sets kj e g 1 section 2 no 1 corollaire furthermore g is the pointwise supremum of an increasing sequence of finite continuous functions j 0 supported by kj e g 1 section 2 proposition 11 observe that j being finite and continuous is bounded from above the functions fj 1 a kj j form an increasing sequence of bounded quasi u s c functions with the supremum f since a kj is quasicompact 1 a kj h 0 and hence fj h 0 in view of 19 lemma 2 4 and theorem 2 5 b as noted shortly before theorem 2 2 the functions fj are e measurable and c capacitable and therefore we conclude by corollary 3 13 that indeed c f c f lemma 4 3 let un be a cover of x by an increasing sequence of open sets un x and let for each n f un be quasicontinuous f f being fixed then f is quasicontinuous on all of x proof by the above definition of quasicontinuity there exists for every n an open set vn un such that f un vn is continuous in the extended sense and that c vn 2 n set v n vn open in x then c v n c vn since the open sets un cover x while f un v is continuous so is f v 4 2 relations between the energy capacity and the standard g capacity in view of lemma 4 2 and remark 4 1 we propose to find conditions under which the potential g of any measure m is quasicontinuous as 22 bent fuglede a map into 0 for the proof of the following theorem 4 7 we shall need besides the energy capacity c the g capacity g cap while our study of the energy capacity c provided above requires a kernel to be symmetric and 0 on the diagonal the g capacity is often studied without these requirements in this subsection we shall therefore drop these requirements and unless stated otherwise allow g to be any l s c function x x 0 x locally com pact its adjoint kernel g is defined by g x y g y x for x y x the symmetric part of g is 1 2 g g and will be denoted by g a kernel g is said to satisfy the continuity principle evans vasilesco or to be regular choquet 7 if for any measure m of compact support supp the potential g is finite and continuous on all of x provided that it is finite and continuous relative to supp a kernel g is said to satisfy the dilated maximum principle if there exists a constant k 1 such that for any measure m of compact support and with potential g 1 a e we have g k everywhere on x when k is specified we speak of the k dilated maximum principle for k 1 this is simply called the frostman maximum principle theorem 4 4 if g is finite off the diagonal and continuous in the extended sense on x x and if the restriction of g to k k satisfies the dilated maximum principle for every compact k then g is regular this is due to ohtsuka 25 26 27 eq 1 10 p 155 and independently choquet 7 without proof a symmetric kernel g which satisfies the maximum principle is positive definite 9 24 the g capacity of a compact set k x is defined by 4 1 g cap k sup k m g 1 everywhere see 8 3 p 43 27 17 we further assume that g is non degenerate in the first variable in the sense that g y 6 0 for every y x of course this assumption is satisfied if g is strictly positive on the diagonal equivalently g 6 0 for every non zero m in fact for given y supp choose x x so that g x y 0 and open neighborhoods u of x and v of y so that g 0 on u v and hence g x 0 conversely take y hence g x y g x 0 we show that this second definition further is equivalent to the following third definition s m g 1 on x is vaguely compact in the first place s is clearly vaguely closed by the first definition for any y x there exists xy x with g xy y 0 hence there is an open neighborhood vy of y such that g xy z 1 2 g xy y for all z vy it follows that 1 2 g xy y vy vy g xy z d z g xy 1 for every s symmetric function kernels and sweeping of measures 23 and so vy is bounded as a function of s since finitely many vy cover k this shows that the function 7 k indeed is bounded on s and so s is compact conversely if s is compact it cannot contain a ray t t 0 as it would if g 0 for some non zero m this proves that the supremum in the definition of g cap k is attained and hence finite when g is non degenerate from now on g is assumed to be strictly positive on the diagonal then so is g recall that the energy capacity of a compact set k x for a symmetric kernel g strictly positive on the diagonal is characterized by either of the following two equalities c g k max k e g d 1 4 2 c g k 2 max k e g 1 a e on x 4 3 cf theorem 2 2 or eq 2 5 respectively for the kernel g and functions of class h 0 in particular for indicator functions for compact sets then every maximizing measure for any of 4 1 4 2 4 3 is clearly carried by k and has finite energy we show that 4 4 c g k 2 g cap k let be a maximizing measure for g cap k then g d k we may assume that g d 0 for otherwise 0 by remark 2 1 and hence g cap k 0 clearly g d g d also denoted by 2 writing we have 1 so competes for c g k in 4 2 it follows that c g k k k k g cap k because 2 g d k this establishes 4 4 if g satisfies the k dilated maximum principle we obtain an inequality in the opposite direction let be maximizing for c g k 2 in 4 3 since g 2 g it follows that g 1 everywhere writing 2 k thus competes for g cap k and so g cap k k k 2 k c g k 2 2 k whence 4 5 c g k 2 2 k g cap k in 7 8 choquet has studied relations between g cap and g cap with out assuming g x x 0 it is interesting and perhaps more or less new that such relations have close counterparts in relations between g cap and the energy capacity c g the inequality 4 5 is a counterpart to the inequality g cap k 4 k g cap k established in 8 lemme 4 we proceed to estab lish two more advanced relationships theorems 4 7 and 4 8 below between g cap and c g counterparts to 8 proposition 2 the ore me 1 24 bent fuglede following 7 a point x 0 x is called a point of k undulation for g k 1 real if for any neighborhood v of x 0 there exists a measure on a compact set k v such that g is bounded on k and sup x v g x k sup x k g x we denote by ok the set of all points of k undulation for g and by o k 1 ok the set of all points of so called strong undulation clearly ok and o are closed subsets of x and every point of o has an open neighborhood v such that g v v satisfies the dilated maximum principle definition 4 5 a regular kernel g on x is said to be strongly regular if g is finite and continuous off the diagonal and strictly positive on the diagonal and if at least one limit point of o has a countable base of neighborhoods e g if x is first countable the following theorem 4 6 was established by ohtsuka 27 corollary 2 p 170 inspired by a similar result announced by choquet 7 8 theorem 4 6 if g is strongly regular then o is discrete theorem 4 7 let x be compact suppose that g is strongly regular and that g x x for every point x o then the outer g capacity g cap and the outer energy capacity c g are simultaneously small explicitly for any 0 there exists 0 such that for every subset a of x g cap a implies c g a and similarly with the two capacities interchanged proof the latter case follows from 4 4 extended to outer capacities of ar bitrary sets a for the former case according to theorem 4 6 above o is discrete hence finite by compactness of x for any x o g x x by hypothesis that is x has infinite energy hence cg x 0 and altogether c g o 0 for given 0 fix an open set o so that cg 2 the set k is compact along with x the restriction of g to k k satisfies the k dilated maximum principle for some constant k k 1 cf text just before definition 4 5 now define 2 8 k for any a x with g cap a we therefore have by extension of 4 5 to outer capacity of arbitrary sets c g a k 2 2 k g cap a k 2 4 and so indeed c g a c g a c g a k 2 2 in section 4 1 we have defined quasitopological concepts such as a quasi continuous function with respect to outer energy capacity c for a symmetric symmetric function kernels and sweeping of measures 25 kernel there are similar concepts with c replaced by any other outer capacity c on x cf 18 section 1 5 theorem 4 8 let x be countable at infinity suppose that g is strongly regular and that g x x for every point x o the g potential of any m is quasicontinuous with respect to the outer energy capacity c g proof the requirement that x be countable at infinity means that x can be covered by a sequence of compact subsets and hence also by an increasing sequence of open relatively compact sets un x such that un un 1 e g 2 chap 1 sect 9 prop 15 write gn g un un and denote by n the restriction of to un then gn is strongly regular along with g by 8 the ore me 1 applied to the regular kernel gn the potential gn n is finite q e and quasicontinuous on un with respect to the g capacity relative to the kernel g n on the compact space un in view of theorem 4 7 applied to the kernel g n in place of g and finally also with respect to the energy capacity c g on x in fact unlike what would be the case for g cap we have for any compact set k un cg k cg n k because the energy g d of any measure on k and hence the corresponding gauss integral only depend on the restriction of g to k k for any open set v un we therefore have cg v cg n v open sets being obviously capacitable with respect to energy capacity thus g n gn n is quasicontinuous on un with respect to c g and g n is even continuous on un which does not meet supp n in view of the finiteness and continuity of g off the diagonal consequently the sum g of these two quasicontinuous g potentials on un is quasicontinuous on un with respect to c g finally by lemma 4 3 g is indeed quasicontinuous on all of x with respect to c g corollary 4 9 under the hypotheses of theorem 4 8 we have for any subset e of x g cap e 0 if and only if c g e 0 this follows from theorem 4 7 in view of the usual definition of inner and outer capacities see e g 19 p 38 4 3 sweeping of measures after this excursion to possibly non symmetric kernels in the preceding subsection we shall from now on again only consider symmetric kernels g strictly positive on the diagonal we henceforth assume that g is consistent and positive definite for simplicity of statement we even assume that g is strictly positive definite and hence altogether perfect in the sense of 15 definition 3 3 and theorem 3 3 under suitable additional hypotheses we shall then define balayage sweeping of an arbitrary measure 26 bent fuglede m onto a quasiclosed set a x such that f 1 ag has c f and hence f h 0 by lemma 4 2 that will make theorems 2 3 and 3 15 ap plicable in the first place this will lead to theorem 4 10 about pseudobalayage or improper balayage of on a but in the presence of a suitable domination principle we obtain proper balayage in theorem 4 12 the gauss integral associated with f reads 4 6 2 a g d 2 as a function of e for such a is measurable by 19 corollary 6 1 because a is quasiopen and so 1 a is of class g by 19 lemma 2 4 by variation of the gauss integral in theorems 2 3 and 3 15 we only need to con sider measures e a that is measures e carried by a because the gauss integral defined by 4 6 increases when is replaced by its restriction to a this leads to 4 8 in theorem 4 10 below similarly concerning the other variational characterization of a stated in 4 9 in theorem 4 10 the gauss integral 4 6 now reads 2 g d 2 2 2 e a 4 7 the latter expression applicable when e in which case we have g h 0 by definition 3 4 and hence 1 ag h 0 by lemma 3 14 in the following theorem we achieve the same for any measure m for suitable x and g the hypothesis that g be strictly positive definite being unnecessary for 1 ag to be of class h 0 theorem 4 10 let g be perfect that is consistent and strictly positive def inite for a given measure m suppose either that e or that x is countable at infinity that g is strongly regular and that g x x for ev ery point x o for any quasiclosed set a x such that c 1 ag we have 1 ag h 0 and c 1 ag 2 max e a 2 g d 2 4 8 c 1 ag 2 max g d e a g g a e 4 9 in either case 4 8 or 4 9 there is precisely one maximizing measure the same in both cases this maximizing measure denoted by a is of class e a and is characterized within e a by the following properties a and b a g a g q e on a b g a g a a e and a has the following further properties symmetric function kernels and sweeping of measures 27 c g d a g a d a 2 c 1 ag 2 d c 1 ag min e g g q e on a proof we apply theorems 2 3 and 3 15 to f 1 ag by remark 4 1 resp theorem 4 8 and lemma 4 2 a we have f h 0 thus 4 8 hence also 4 9 follows right away from 2 4 and 2 5 the common maximizing measure a m f is uniquely determined in view of the strict positive definiteness of g because m f is a subset of the equivalence class f theorem 3 15 d the properties a b c including the characterization of a within e a by a and b likewise follow immediately from corresponding asser tions in theorems 2 3 and 3 15 finally property d follows from the equality c 1 ag 1 ag see lemma 3 11 i the unique measure a in theorem 4 10 is said to arise by pseudobalayage or improper balayage of on a if e then a is the nearest point projection of on e a according to 4 7 the most important case of pseudobalayage is of course proper balayage or sweeping in order to achieve sweeping of a given measure on quasiclosed sets a such that c 1 ag we assume that the perfect kernel g satisfies the following domination principle definition 4 11 for a given measure m the kernel g satisfies the domination principle if for any e such that g g a e we have g g everywhere on x if this holds for every measure of finite energy we say that g satisfies the domination principle theorem 4 12 let g be perfect for a given measure m suppose that g satisfies the domination principle also suppose that either e or that x is countable at infinity that g is strongly regular and that g x x for every point x o for any quasiclosed set a x such that c 1 ag we then have 1 ag h 0 and 4 8 and 4 9 from theorem 4 10 hold both with precisely one maximizing measure the same in both cases this maximizing measure is termed the sweeping of on a and denoted by a it is characterized within e a by the property a g a g q e on a and has the following further properties b g a g everywhere on x c g d a g a d a 2 c 1 ag 2 d c 1 ag min e g g q e on a proof in fact a and b from theorem 4 10 imply together a and b after applying the domination principle to b conversely a implies both a trivially and b in view of 2 2 2 3 and because a e a the remaining assertions follow from theorem 4 10 28 bent fuglede 4 4 capacitary measure and equilibrium measure on a quasiclosed set it is easy to adapt the proofs of theorem 4 10 resp 4 12 so as to establish corresponding results theorem 4 13 resp remark 4 14 on the capacitary measure resp the equilibrium measure on a quasiclosed set a x of finite outer capacity c a we simply replace g by 1 and a by the capacitary measure resp the equilibrum measure ona both denoted by a and therefore replace c 1 ag by c a the use of lemma 4 2 in the proof of theorem 4 10 is now replaced by the fact that every quasiclosed set a x with c a is quasicompact according to lemma 3 14 b furthermore in order to establish remark 4 14 the domination principle in theorem 4 12 is now replaced by the frostman maximum principle countability of x at infinity and strong regularity for g serving to establish quasicontinuity of g in case are not needed here because the function 1 is even continuous theorem 4 13 let g be perfect for any quasiclosed set a x with c a we have 1 a h 0 and c a 2 max e a 2 g d max e a 2 x 2 4 10 c a 2 max x e a g 1 a e 4 11 in either case 4 10 or 4 11 there is precisely one maximizing measure the same in both cases this maximizing measure termed the capacitary measure on a and denoted by a is carried by a and is characterized within e a by the following properties a and b a g a 1 q e on a b g a 1 a a e and a has the following further properties c a a a 2 c a 2 d c a min e g 1 q e on a remark 4 14 if in addition g satisfies the maximum principle then we get the actual equilibrium measure rather than the capacitary measure now a of the above theorem becomes a g a 1 q e on a whereas b becomes b g a 1 everywhere on x furthermore a alone now characterizes a within e a 4 5 outer balayage on an arbitrary set we apply theorem 4 12 to f 1 ag where m is a given measure and a now is an arbitrary subset of x with c 1 ag instead of a quasiclosed set with that property assuming that x has a countable base and that g is perfect there is a c equivalence class of quasiclosures a of a that is quasiclosed sets qua sicontaining a and quasi minimal with these two properties explicitly let us say that a set b quasicontains a set a if c a b 0 then a quasiclosure symmetric function kernels and sweeping of measures 29 of a is defined as a quasiclosed set a quasicontaining a and such that every quasiclosed set b which quasicontains a also quasicontains a equivalently 1 a shall equal 1 a a quasi u s c envelope of 1 a see the paragraph pre ceding definition 3 18 directly a quasiclosure a of a exists according to 18 theorem 2 7 applied to the outer capacity c on subsets of x defined by c e c 1 eg e x noting that c is sequentially order continuous from below on arbitrary sets because c is sequentially order continuous from below on f corollary 3 13 the c equivalence class of all quasiclosures of a obviously depends only on the c equivalence class of a from theorem 4 12 we have in view of lemma 3 14 cf theorem 4 8 the following result on outer balayage theorem 4 15 suppose that x has a countable base and that g is perfect consider a measure m such that g satisfies the domination principle a set a x with c 1 ag and a quasiclosure a of a suppose moreover that either e or that g is strongly regular and that g x x for every x o then c 1 ag c 1 a g the sweeping a of on a is also called the outer sweeping of on a and denoted by a it is carried by a and is characterized within e a by the following property a g a g q e on a hence q e on a and a has the following further properties b g a g everywhere on x c g d a g a d a 2 c 1 ag 2 d c 1 ag min e g g q e on a concerning d since a quasicontains a we have e g g q e on a e g g q e on a here equality prevails in fact being of class h 0 by definition 3 4 g is quasi u s c and because g is l s c the set g g is quasiclosed and since it quasicontains a it also quasicontains a by definition of a corollary 4 16 under the hypotheses on x g and a in theorem 4 15 suppose in addition that e a then a a b a b a b a for any set b quasicontaining a here a follows from the unique characterization of a by the property a in theorem 4 15 obviously possessed by itself the former equality b holds by a applied with and a replaced by a and b respectively noting that a e a e b since a is quasicontained in b and since a does not charge the sets of zero upper capacity the latter equality b holds by the characterization of a within e a by the same property a but now 30 bent fuglede with replaced by b noting that g b a g b g g a q e on a the second equality valid even q e on b a and so indeed b a a 4 6 outer equilibrium on an arbitrary set replacing g in theorem 4 15 by the constant function 1 we obtain a similar result for outer equilib rium whereby the domination principle shall be replaced by the maximum principle and there is no need for strong regularity of g here the function 1 being continuous corollary 4 17 suppose that x has a countable base and that g is perfect and satisfies the maximum principle consider a set a x with c a and a quasiclosure a of a then c a c a the equilibrium measure a on a is also called the outer equilibrium measure on a and denoted by a it is carried by a and is characterized within e a by the following property a g a 1 q e on a hence q e on a furthermore a and c a have the following properties b g a 1 everywhere on x c a x a 2 c a 2 d c a min e g 1 q e on a we omit the quite parallel study of the inner balayage and the inner equi librium for an arbitrary set a x the following theorem will not be used in the present study theorem 4 18 suppose that x has a countable base and that g is perfect for any quasiclosed set a x the convex set e a is strongly closed in e proof consider a sequence j e a which converges strongly and hence vaguely to some measure e cf 15 definition 3 3 the sequence j is bounded say j a for some constant a and lim infj j a by vague convergence furthermore is carried by the quasiclosed set a according to 19 corollary 6 2 so indeed e a 4 7 quasi topology and fine topology on x with respect to g through out this subsection we assume thatx has a countable base and thatg is consis tent and positive definite we have on x the cartan fine topology with respect to the kernel g that is the coarsest topology for which every potential g e is continuous we proceed to obtain two results which together express the equivalence of quasitopological properties and corresponding properties relative to the fine topology on x the second and deeper result is based on the following lower envelope principle symmetric function kernels and sweeping of measures 31 theorem 4 19 suppose that g satisfies the domination principle for any family e there then exists a measure e such that g i nf g q e and i nf g inf g g in particular inf g is quasi u s c and equal q e to i nf g here and in what follows f stands for the greatest l s c minorant of f f proof suppose first that the family is a sequence j the function f infj g j is quasi u s c along with each g j h 0 by consistency hence f h 0 cf 19 theorem 2 5 let m f be a capacitary measure for f cf theorem 2 3 then e and by b in that theorem g f a e that is g g j a e for every j by the domination principle g g j everywhere for every j that is g f and actually g f since g is l s c on the other hand by a g f f q e by a lemma of choquet see e g 13 p 169 an arbitrary family e has a countable subfamily j such that i nf g i nf j g j this reduces the former assertion of the theorem to the above case of a countable family in particular inf j g j g q e and since g is quasicontinuous being of class h 0 by consistency so is therefore inf j g j remark 4 20 in newtonian potential theory there is equality in the first in equality g i nf g of the above theorem which therefore becomes the fundamental convergence theorem remark 4 21 for the case where x is compact and g 0 is finite off the diagonal symmetric positive definite and continuous it was shown by kishi 22 theorems 3 1 and 3 2 that g satisfies the domination principle if and only if g satisfies the strong lower envelope principle that is for any two measures e and m there exists m such that g min g g n e on x consistency of g is not required let y denote a locally compact space with a countable base theorem 4 22 every quasicontinuous function f x y is finely continu ous q e every quasi u s c resp quasi l s c function f x 0 is q e finely u s c resp finely l s c every quasiclosed resp quasiopen subset of x differs by some set of zero outer capacity from its fine closure resp from its fine interior proof this follows from 4 theorem iv 3 because c is finely stable in the sense that c a c a for any a x corollary 3 13 a denoting the fine closure of a in fact a depends only on 1 a 1 a from section 3 1 by fine continuity of g for every e 32 bent fuglede the above theorem has the following converse which brelot called the cho quet property in view of 11 for classical potential theory theorem 4 23 every finely continuous function f x y is quasicontinu ous every finely u s c resp finely l s c function is quasi u s c resp quasi l s c every finely closed resp finely open subset of x is quasiclosed resp quasiopen proof in view of theorem 4 19 this follows from 4 theorem iv 7 remark 4 24 in the setting of theorem 4 15 the outer balayage measure a is carried by the fine closure a of a and even by the base of a the set of points of a at which a is not thin because the remaining points of a form a set of zero outer capacity and thus a null set for a remark 4 25 by way of example theorems 4 19 4 22 and 4 23 hold for the m riesz kernels x y n on rn of order 0 2 as shown in 18 sections 5 5 5 7 the dilated domination principle implies a dilated form of theorem 4 19 which suffices for the purpose of establishing theorem 4 23 and 4 22 above that covers the case of the m riesz kernels of any order 0 n 4 8 epilogue if we compare the results on balayage and equilibrium with respect to the kernel g obtained in the present article with corresponding results by cartan in 6 for the newtonian kernel or the m riesz kernels the main difference is our use of quasitopological concepts whereby the theory of balayage even on quasiclosed sets or outer balayage on more general sets is obtained by the gauss variational method our results only cover outer balayage of on sets a such that c 1 ag whereas more general sets a occur in 6 however the case c 1 ag in 6 uses balayage of superharmonic functions which are not necessarily potentials and in the present setting that would require severe restrictions on the kernel g beyond the requirements imposed on g for our theorems 4 12 on balayage and 4 15 on outer balayage and similarly for equilibrium and outer equilibrium references 1 n bourbaki topologie ge ne rale chap 5 hermann paris 1958 2 n bourbaki topologie ge ne rale chap 1 2 hermann paris 1961 3 m
