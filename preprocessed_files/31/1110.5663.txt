from operator theory we prove constructively prove the existence of solutions to dirichle t problems for planar jordan domains with at least two boundary curves an iterative method is thus obtained and explicit bounds on the error in the resulting approximations are given finally a closed form for the solution is given no amount of differentiability of the boundary is assumed 1 introduction suppose we are given a bounded jordan domain d c and a piecewise contin uous function f d r the resulting dirichle t problem is to find a harmonic function on d u such that lim z u z f 1 1 for all d at which f is continuous it is well known that this dirichle t problem has a solution once the existence of u is demonstrated uniqueness follows immediately from the maximum principle for harmonic functions that is there is exactly one harmonic function on d u for which equation 1 1 holds see e g chapters i and ii of 4 accordingly we denote this function uf dirichle t problems for other kinds of domains exist but will not be considered here when d is simply connected that is when d is the interior of a jordan curve it is fairly straightforward to prove the existence of uf in particular when d is the unit disk d uf z 1 2 d f p z ds where p z 1 z 2 z 2 and ds is the differential of arc length with respect to the variable the function p is of course called the poisson kernel since the composition of a harmonic function with an analytic function yields a harmonic function the existence of uf for simply connected jordan domains now follows from the riemann mapping theorem and the carathe odory theorem when d is bounded by more than one jordan curve there are at least two methods available to prove the existence of uf one is an extreme value argument as in section 6 4 2 of 1 if one desires a constructive proof a natural choice is the 2010 mathematics subject classification 31 47 key words and phrases harmonic functions dirichle t problems operator theory constructive complex

that converges to u is produced thereby however the proof does not give any information about the rate of convergence which is essential for error control when designing a numerical method nevertheless it is hinted in the exercises of 4 that the schwarz alternating method can be turned into an integral operator which in turn leads to a numerical method with error control here we will turn this chain of ideas on its head and give what appears to be a new and constructive proof of the existence of solutions to dirichle t problems for planar jordan domains based on some fairly elementary ideas from operator theory namely we will first define an integral operator and then show it has a fixed point u we will then show that this fixed point extends to a harmonic function on d for which equation 1 1 holds we will also give explicit bounds on the error in the resulting sequence of iterations finally we use these results to derive a closed form for the solution to the dirichle t problem all results hold for an arbitrary jordan domain with at least two boundary curves even those whose boundary is nowhere differentiable 2 a few preliminaries when r is a positive real and z 0 c let dr z 0 denote the open disk whose center is z 0 and whose radius is r let d d 1 0 let bharm d denote the space of bounded harmonic functions on d with the sup norm proposition 2 1 if d is open then bharm d is complete proof let u 1 u 2 be a cauchy sequence in bharm d it follows that this se quence converges uniformly to a function u d r it follows that u is continuous and bounded it remains to show that u is harmonic to do so we use the mean value property accordingly suppose dr z 0 d then u z 0 lim n un z 0 lim n 1 2 2 0 un z 0 re i d 1 2 2 0 lim n un z 0 re i d 1 2 2 0 u z 0 re i d it follows that u is harmonic 3 an operator theoretic existence proof suppose d is a bounded jordan domain suppose f d r is piecewise continuous let 1 n 1 1 n 1 be pairwise disjoint arcs such that d 1 df d j and d 2 df d j are simply connected the case when d is bounded by four curves is illustrated in figure 1 let j j and let j j let j be a continuous map of d onto dj that is conformal on d thus each point of d has exactly one preimage under 1 and each point of d has an operator theoretic existence proof of solutions to planar dirichle t problems 3 figure 1 exactly one preimage under 2 the existence of these maps follows from theorem 2 1 of 5 let aj 1 j d b 1 1 1 b 2 1 2 let h 1 be the harmonic function on d 1 determined by the boundary conditions h 1 f if d 0 if d and let h 2 be the harmonic function on d 2 determined by the boundary conditions h 2 f if d 0 if d 4 timothy h mcnicholl it follows that h 1 and h 2 have the integral forms h 1 z 1 2 a 1 p 11 z f 1 ds h 2 z 1 2 a 2 p 12 z f 2 ds let h 3 be the harmonic function on d 1 determined by the boundary conditions h 3 h 2 if 0 otherwise thus h 3 has the integral form h 3 z 1 2 b 1 p 11 z h 2 1 ds 3 1 finally let h h 1 h 3 3 2 for each 1 b 2 let k 1 be the harmonic function on d 1 defined by the boundary conditions k 1 0 6 2 p 12 1 thus k has the integral form k z 1 b 1 p 12 1 1 p 1 1 z ds note that 12 is bounded away from b 2 as ranges over accordingly let m max b 2 p 12 1 ds 1 it follows that m 2 we now define an operator on bharm d 1 when v is harmonic on d 1 let f v denote the function on d 1 defined by the equation f v z h z 1 2 2 b 2 k z 1 v 2 1 ds 1 the key lemma is the following lemma 3 1 f is a contraction map on bharm d 1 in particular for all v 1 v 2 bharm d 1 f v 1 f v 2 m 2 v 1 v 2 proof we first show that f v is a harmonic function on d 1 whenever v is that is f maps bharm d 1 into bharm d 1 this can be seen by expanding f v z an operator theoretic existence proof of solutions to planar dirichle t problems 5 and applying fubini s theorem so as to obtain f v z h 1 z 1 2 b 1 1 2 a 2 f 2 1 p 1 2 1 1 ds 1 p 11 z ds 1 2 b 1 1 2 b 2 v 2 1 p 1 2 1 1 ds 1 p 11 z ds 3 3 each summand in equation 3 3 defines a harmonic function on d 1 thus f v is harmonic on d 1 whenever v is we now show that f is a contraction map it follows from fubini s theorem that b 2 k z 1 ds 1 b 1 b 2 p 12 1 1 ds 1 p 11 z ds however b 1 b 2 p 12 1 1 ds 1 p 11 z ds m b 1 p 11 z ds 2 m the conclusion follows so let u be the fixed point of f lemma 3 2 u extends to a harmonic function on d such that f limz u z for all d at which f is continuous proof by lemma 3 1 u is harmonic on d 1 it follows from equation 3 3 and fubini s theorem that u z f u z h 1 z 1 2 b 1 g 1 p 1 1 z ds where g z 1 2 a 2 p 12 z 1 f 2 1 ds 1 1 2 b 2 p 12 z 1 u 2 1 ds 1 thus g is the harmonic function on d 2 defined by the boundary conditions g f d u d it also follows that u is the harmonic function on d 1 defined by the boundary conditions u f d g d hence g u for all decompose d into the simply connected domains s 1 sn as in figure 2 it follows that u g for all sj it then follows that u z g z for all z sj it then follows that u extends to a harmonic function on d that solves the given dirichle t problem 6 timothy h mcnicholl figure 2 a few moments of reflection will reveal that what the operator f does is the basic step in the schwarz alternating method however by couching things in the framework of operator theory it becomes possible to prove convergence using the contraction mapping theorem the proof thus gives more information than would be obtained by using harnack s principle since it reveals the rate of convergence of the construction which is important for computation 4 a closed form we first perform a procedure similar to kernel iteration let k 1 z 1 k z 1 k n 1 z 1 bn 2 k z n 1 n j 1 k 2 j 1 j ds 2 ds n 1 n 1 2 k z 1 n 1 1 2 2 n k n z 1 theorem 4 1 suppose d is a planar jordan domain with at least two boundary curves and that f d r is piecewise continuous let h bj etc be as in an operator theoretic existence proof of solutions to planar dirichle t problems 7 section 3 then uf z h z b 2 k z 1 h

restriction of uf to d 1 let z d 1 by induction on t 1 2 3 f t 1 0 z h z t n 1 1 2 2 n b 2 k n z 1 h 2 1 ds 1 it follows from lemma 3 1 that f j 0 f j 1 0 m 2 j f 0 m 2 j h by the maximum principle h f by a fairly standard calculation f t 1 0 u n t 1 m 2 k f m 2 t 1 2 2 m f it follows that equations 4 1 and 4 2 hold whenever z d 1 hence by conti nuity they hold for all z d we mention here that d
