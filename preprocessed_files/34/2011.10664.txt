attractor power series calculation of lyapunov exponents abstract in various fields of natural science the chaotic systems of differential equa tions are considered more than 50 years the correct prediction of the be haviour of solutions of dynamical model equations is important in under standing of evolution process and reduce uncertainty however often used numerical methods are unable to do it on large time segments in this ar ticle the author considers the modern numerical method and algorithm for constructing solutions of chaotic systems on the example of tumor growth model also a modification of benettin s algorithm presents for calculation of lyapunov exponents 1 introduction in 1963 lorenz considered in 1 the dynamical system x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 rx 1 x 2 x 1 x 3 x 3 x 1 x 2 bx 3 from a model describing a rayleigh benard convection at 10 r 28 and b 8 3 in this system there is the chaotic behaviour of solutions i e the solutions are unstable and at the same time bounded as it is known from the classical work 2 if the solutions are limited for time t 0 then the limit set exists the trajectories of the dynamical system are attracted to it for t after approx 13 years after the lorenz article the hypothesis about the structure of the lorenz attractor was formulated in 3 6 it was based on computational experiments let us show the several dynamic systems with chaotic behaviour of trajectories at the last 50 years 1 in the article 7 the authors described the chaotic change in time of the magnetic poles of earth the rikitake system 2 tyson 8 described the scheme and proposed a modified equation of oregonator it reflects the features of the self oscillating chemical reaction of belousov zhabotinsky corresponding author email address pchelintsev an yandex ru http

the equatorial region of ocean which have a strong influence on the global climate of earth 4 in 11 12 sprott showed the nineteen 3 rd order ordinary differential equations odes and 3 rd order ode which exhibits chaos the similar systems were later 13 14 5 stenflo 15 received a system describing the evolution of amplitude acoustic gravity waves in a rotating atmosphere the lorenz stenflo system reduced to the lorenz system when the parameter tied with the flow rotation is equal to zero 6 chen considered 16 17 the controlled lorenz equation with a linear feedback controller and received a new system with a double scroll chaotic attractor 7 not so long ago the nonlinear economic systems e g 18 appeared where there is chaos 8 the canonical gause lotka volterra model for describing of human sequential memory dynamics is considered in 19 20 the lorenz system and all of these systems are united not only by the chaotic behaviour of solutions but by type of nonlinearities in the right hand side of equations these models have the quadratic nonlinearities the authors 21 are presented a detailed analysis of the hidden attractors in some of them many researchers used the classical numerical methods to study the attractors of dynamical systems for example the explicit euler scheme with the central difference scheme 1 the adams method 22 23 the higher derivatives scheme 24 and the runge kutta methods 7 18 25 26 this methods cannot be used to build of correct prediction due to the unstability of solutions at a given time segment since the global calculating error grows by increasing of time the attractors are examined on large time segments it noted lorenz in his report 27 the butterfly effect but such error is limited by the diameter of sphere containing an attractor now there are methods that the accumulation of errors is not as great as it was in the classical methods motsa 28 29 presented a the piecewise quasilinearization and multistage spectral relaxation methods which are based on the chebyshev spectral method to solve the system and iteration schemes at each subinterval of integration in the article 30 the authors used the differential quadrature method with a similar idea to the solution of system of odes another used method is the homotopy perturbation method 31 in these methods the main problems are the choice of integration step and calculation error of the numerical method starting around the 1960 s the method of power series is starting to develop for applied computing gibbons in 32 considered the main types of right hand sides of odes and corresponding computational formulas today this idea was generalized in a recursive procedure called as automatic differentiation to compute the values of the derivatives for power series 33 an advantage over the general taylor series method is that the calculations can be constructed by fast formulas in comparison to the direct symbolic differentiation of right hand sides of nonlinear odes which requires a lot of computer memory for high precision calculations the method of power series in 34 36 is applied as the adomian decomposition method adm the clean numerical simulation cns 40 45 is based on the method of power series at arbitrary order and used the multiple precision data plus a check of solution by means of an additional computation using even smaller numerical noises in the fgbfi method the firmly grounded backward forward integration method 37 39 the authors have taken into account the above shortcomings of numerical methods used for constructing solutions of chaotic type i e 1 the recurrence relations for calculating of the coefficients of expansion of local solutions in a power series are received for any dynamic system with quadratic nonlinearities in the general form 2 the convergence of the power series is studied the authors derived a simple formula of calculating the length of the integration step in the general form e g it distinguishes the fgbfi method from cns alexander n pchelintsev journal of applied nonlinear dynamics 9 2 2020 207 221 3 3 the criteria for checking the accuracy of the approximate chaotic solution are obtained there are the control of accuracy and configuration of obtained approximate solution of a dynamical system with the forward and backward time which makes the reliability of the numerical method the degrees of piecewise polynomials the value of the maximum step of integration etc in this paper the author considers the fgbfi method for constructing solutions of chaotic biological system 46 the model of tumor growth the main advantage of this method is what it allows to produce a more accurate research of the behaviour of solutions of dynamical systems in very large time segments let us note that the fgbfi method can be used in the encryption system constructed by means of continuous time chaotic systems 47 and also for verification of approximate periodic solutions of continuous nonlinear dynamical systems 48 49 2 method of finding of approximate solutions describing the tumor growth let us consider the model developed in the article 46 x 1 2 nx 1 x 2 1 hx 1 x 3 x 2 4 i x 2 0 5 x 2 1 0 14 x 2 2 0 5 hx 2 x 3 0 001 x 2 3 x 3 ix 3 0 07 x 2 2 0 5 hx 2 x 3 0 002 x 2 3 1 where x 1 t x 2 t and x 3 t are a population of proliferating tumor cells in the avascular vascular and metastasis phases respectively n h and i are some numbers the essence of the system parameters n is a population of normal cells h is a population of the host cells and i is a population of immune cells t lymphocytes ctl and natural killer nk cells in this system there is the chaotic solutions for certain values of the parameters the right side of this system has the quadratic nonlinearities then we can apply the fgbfi method de scribed in the articles 37 39 to construct an accurate prediction of solutions in a given time segment for this purpose we rewrite system in the vector form 39 x ax x 2 where x t x 1 t x 2 t x 3 t t x 1 x 2 x 3 x t p x qpx x p 1 3 a 2 n 0 0 0 4 i 0 0 0 i q 1 1 0 h 0 0 0 0 0 0 q 2 0 5 0 0 0 0 14 0 5 h 0 0 0 001 q 3 0 0 0 0 0 07 0 5 h 0 0 0 002 we expand the solution as x 1 t i 0 1 it i x 2 t i 0 2 it i x 3 t i 0 3 it i 3 where x 1 0 1 0 x 2 0 2 0 and x 3 0 3 0 are initial conditions 4 alexander n pchelintsev journal of applied nonlinear dynamics 9 2 2020 207 221 the formulas for calculating of the coefficients obtained as follows the multiplications of phase coordinates are assigned by the sums x 2 1 x 1 x 1 r 1 i i j 0 1 j 1 i j x 2 2 r 2 i i j 0 2 j 2 i j x 2 3 r 3 i i j 0 3 j 3 i j x 1 x 3 r 4 i i j 0 1 j 3 i j x 2 x 3 r 5 i i j 0 2 j 3 i j then the relations for calculating the coefficients of the series are 1 i 1 2 n 1 i r 1 i hr 4 i i 1 2 i 1 4 i 2 i 0 5 r 1 i 0 14 r 2 i 0 5 hr 5 i 0 001 r 3 i i 1 3 i 1 i 3 i 0 07 r 2 i 0 5 hr 5 i 0 002 r 3 i i 1 4 for i 0 1 2 by analogy with 37 38 this formulas is simpler and faster for calculating than in adm since the criteria for checking the accuracy of the approximate chaotic solutions require to go in the back ward time repeatedly then we need to have a guaranteed estimation of a region of convergence for given 1 0 2 0 3 0 it is usually assumed in some articles e g 50 that the integration step is given and does not change in a calculating experiment in the nonlinear case or at all not justified we can research the asymptotic behaviour 1 i 2 i and 3 i to determine the integration step but this question is poorly investigated today for nonlinear recurrence relations unlike the linear case 51 in the article 39 the authors proved the theorem about estimation a region of convergence for the odes with any quadratic nonlinearities in particular in this case for i 0 h 1 n 0 a a 1 max 2 n 4 i i q 1 q 1 1 h q 2 q 2 1 0 5 h 0 001 q 3 q 3 1 0 5 h 0 002 3 max p 1 3 qp 3 h next we calculate h 1 3 p 1 p 0 h 2 h 21 a 2 h 1 if h 1 1 a otherwise t 1 h 2 5 where t is the integration step and is an any positive number can take a very small as seen the integration step is calculated quite simple which makes it use in practice a detailed description of the algorithm of constructing the approximate chaotic solutions for the any time segment is given in the next section alexander n pchelintsev journal of applied nonlinear dynamics 9 2 2020 207 221 5 3 algorithm for construction of approximate solution before we will seek the approximate solutions of the system 2 it is necessary determine the boundaries what is limited of researched solution the sphere sa limiting the attractor may be this boundary we can set sa e g based on 1 on the results of a preliminary calculating experiment by any numerical method for estimating the ap proximate boundaries of attractor 2 the lyapunov function 1

a class of high dimensional quadratic autonomous dynamical systems let ba is a ball bounded by the sphere sa next we show the constructing algorithm of approximate solution 1 set the quantity bm of bits for the mantissa of a real number and accuracy p for the power series expansion the number bm determines the machine epsilon m so we need to take with a reserve of this value i e choose the value

fgbfi method on the plane is shown in fig 1 the points a 1 a 10 and b 1 b 10 are the projections on the plane x 1 ox 2 of the points x t when running this algorithm if a value of the accuracy p is large then following in the backward time we will go to infinity because the solutions are strongly unstable at t therefore the algorithm uses the ball ba for the control of finding approximate solutions within the boundaries of the attractor for return to the given neighborhood r the value p and the number bm respectively selected in the calculating experiment in fact the value r determines how many digits of each coordinate of the point b 11 see fig 1 must coincide with the digits of corresponding coordinates of the initial point x 0 when we construct the approximate solution in the backward time also we use the configuration analysis of the approximate chaotic solution to check the accuracy it in this case we calculate the maximum degrees of piecewise polynomials which must be the same at the forward and backward time as in the articles 38 39 4 calculating experiments we made a calculating experiment for n 5 h 3 and i 0 7 46 by the fgbfi method in the calculation the point x 1 0 0 1450756817 x 2 0 0 8395885828 x 3 0 9 954786333 is found near the attractor the calculation parameters are bm 160 m 1 36846 10 48 and p 10 40 following by the backward time it is enough to get the coincidence of all the decimal places r 10 10 of the initial conditions for computing in the time segment 0 27 327 also the maximum degrees of piecewise polynomials coincide at the forward and backward time i e the criteria of the article 39 for checking the accuracy of the approximate solution are performed we recorded the rapprochements of trajectory with the initial point to the table 1 with the time step 0 001 see the highlighted strings in fig 2 wherein t 0 0 t x 1 t x 1 t 0 2 x 2 t x 2 t 0 2 x 3 t x 3 t 0 2 since the asymptotic trajectory is poisson stable based on the observed

is positive and near to zero and the kaplan yorke dimension is near to integer value see table 5 thus for large values t we leave the periodic regime there is a weak chaotic solution the trajectory

shown in table 2 since we are using the 10 th characters after the decimal point as the accurate then the error 3 68753 10 9 is not so great in relation to the length t of the integration interval here the maximum degree of the polynomials is equal to 25 the minimum degree is equal to 15 for the fgbfi method we compared the lengths t of the integration intervals and accuracies p for different dynamic systems in table 3 as this table shows the value p is not so small for the sprott jafari system 58 this can be explained by the fact that the almost periodic solution that we received in the article 39 has very near to zero or even negative value max also note max for solution in fig 4 of the system 1 is positive and near to zero see sect 5 therefore we have not such a big errors for the rk 4 method 5 calculation of lyapunov exponents usually many researchers construct a linearized system of odes for the system 1 to determine the lyapunov exponents we propose to expand the system 1 by adding the linearized equations the resulting system of 6 th order will also have a quadratic right hand side let us show it let x 4 t x 5 t and x 6 t are perturbations we find it is assumed that the
