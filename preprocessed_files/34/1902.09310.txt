stochastic ejection of nanocontact droplet solitons via drift instability richard o moore department of mathematical sciences new jersey institute of technology newark new jersey 07102 mark a hoefer department of applied mathematics university of colorado boulder colorado 80302 dated february 26 2019 abstract the magnetic droplet soliton is a large amplitude coherently precessing wave state that exists in ferromagnetic thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy to effectively sustain a droplet magnetic damping can be locally compensated in a nanocontact region that imparts spin transfer torque this has been successfully deployed in experiment to directly image the droplet and probe its dynamics electrically however theory predicts and experiments indicate the existence of a drift instability whereby the droplet is ejected from the spin transfer torque active region and subsequently decays an effect that may be enhanced or possibly induced by thermal fluctuations using soliton perturbation theory and large deviation theory this work determines the soliton ejection rate and the most likely path an ejected soliton tracks in the presence of thermal fields these results lead to an effective lower bound on the stability of magnetic droplet solitons in spin transfer torque nanocontact devices operating at finite temperature and point to ways in which droplets can be made more robust 1 ar x iv 1 90 2 09 31 0 v 1 nl in p s 2 1 f eb 2 01 9 introduction the pursuit of fast scalable nonvolatile storage and new ways to process digital informa tion have motivated much recent study of the formation and control of localized structures in ferromagnetic materials these structures are supported by an energetic balance among contributions from material anisotropy exchange energy dipole or self induced field energy and forcing due to external fields current induced spin torque and magnetic damping some localized structures such as skyrmions are created with a topology that cannot continu ously deform to the trivial state lending promise for additional structural stability in the absence of a driving force other structures such as dissipative solitons are maintained by a balance between driving and damping terms in both cases structures that are stable under deterministic dynamics are generally only quasi stable under the inevitable influence of thermal fluctuations or other stochastic phenomena in this paper we study the effects of weak thermal fluctuations on the magnetic droplet soliton 1 a large amplitude precessing mode that manifests as a balance between nonlin earity due to uniaxial anisotropy and dispersion due to the exchange interaction because of the droplet s precessional dynamics its practical realization was predicted 2 and then observed both indirectly via the giant magnetoresistance gmr effect 3 4 and directly with x ray transmission microscopy 5 6 in a spin transfer torque driven nanocontact de vice that imparts a current induced local torque to compensate uniform magnetic damping additional experiments 7 8 used the gmr effect to measure the nanocontact device s frequency characteristics highlighting a low frequency signal that was attributed to a drift instability whereby the soliton is expelled from the nanocontact and then decays after which a new droplet forms under the nanocontact and the process repeats 2 this drift instability presents a significant challenge to the robust control of droplet solitons and the reliable operation of future spintronic devices due to growing interest in magnetic droplet solitons experiments continue in spin torque nanocontacts 6 9 11 and in spin hall driven nanoconstrictions 12 the existence and dynamics of droplets in nanocontacts have been successfully described using soliton perturbation theory 13 14 that yields a system of ordinary differential equa tions odes for the droplet s parameters that we call the modulation equations the odes fixed points correspond to sustained droplets which for a certain parameter regime 2 are unstable and manifest an increase in the droplet s speed i e the drift instability 15 their stochastic dynamics under a thermal random field were explored theoretically 15 the objective of that study was to compute the approximate variance in droplet parame ters including its frequency linewidth and position relative to the spot of the nanocontact supporting it the ornstein uhlenbeck process derived from linearizing the stochastic model equations about the dissipative droplet state was shown to provide statistics that agree well with simulations of the nonlinear stochastic model and with micromagnetic simulations per formed using open source code mumax 3 that study also contained the description of the aforementioned drift instability occurring at critical bias current an equally important figure of merit for magnetic droplets in the presence of a thermal field is the probability alternatively the rate of ejection where the droplet escapes the attractive potential provided by the finite spatial extent of the nanocontact and then decays due to magnetic damping in the physically relevant limit of weak thermal effects exits occur rarely with a probability or rate determined by large deviation theory in this limit the asymptotic scaling of exit probabilities and rates with vanishing noise strength is provided by a rate function related to the exit path or paths that minimize an action functional this asymptotic scaling provides an order of magnitude estimate for the ejection rate which would otherwise be estimated through sampling using for example a software package such as mumax 3 16 these simulations must resolve dynamics on gyromagnetic time scales of nanoseconds while our estimates show that exits occur on time scales of micro to milliseconds depending on the operating regime monte carlo methods to estimate ejection rates or ejection probabilities over finite times are therefore unreasonably expensive in this work we demonstrate that even in regimes where the droplet fixed point is nominally stable under deterministic dynamics of the modulation odes the proximity of a saddle point associated with the drift instability provides an important mechanism for droplet ejection we use a combination of analytical and numerical techniques to compute the action associated with exits through all saddles with a single unstable manifold including the saddles with nonzero velocity bifurcating through the drift instability 15 and those associated with zero velocity originating in a saddle node bifurcation in the precessional frequency 13 our most important physical result is the determination of the mean time it takes for a deterministically stable droplet to be ejected from the nanocontact due to thermal noise based on physical parameters from recent experiments 7 17 we estimate 3 this time to be approximately 50 nanoseconds or a rate of droplet ejection of 20 mhz which is within an order of magnitude of low frequency observations from recent experiments we estimate that this rate can be manipulated and importantly significantly decreased through appropriate choice of operating parameters model we study a model for the magnetization m msm of the free layer in a thin magnetic film supported from below by a thin nonmagnetic conducting layer followed by a fixed layer with constant magnetization mp mpm p where ms and mp are their respective saturation magnetizations the fixed layer plays the role of a current polarizer enabling both magnetoresistive detection of the free layer magnetization and switching of the free layer through spin transfer torque stt the current density is approximately restricted in space to a circular disc nanocontact of radius r placed on top of the free layer an external field h 0 is applied perpendicular to the layers in order to provide control over the fixed layer magnetization and to stabilize the

stochastic driving term is not strictly normalizable i e does not have bounded variance due to the 1 contribution in the integrand near 0 the deterministic term does not suffer this difficulty since 1 is integrable but not square integrable using the argument that the primary contribution from thermal fluctu ations must come from values at the perimeter of the droplet 1 1 however we disregard the contribution near 0 where the droplet is exponentially close to pointing down to provide a well posed diffusion process since no other parameters depend on and since spatial isotropy allows the coordinate frame to be aligned with with nothing lost but an irrelevant angle the full dynamics of eqns 7 through 10 are captured by the four dimensional system d v i f 1 dt dw 13 d 2 h 0 i 3 2 f 2 dt

events are important phenomena to understand it is now well understood 19 that in the limit as 0 the probability of paths connecting any two states u 1 and u 2 approaches zero with a scaling that is exponential in 2 the rate of this asymptotic decay is dictated by minimizers of the wentzell freidlin action functional st u t t 0 1 2 u f u t u u t 1 u f u dt 24 where the admissible set includes all absolutely continuous paths u t connecting u 1 and u 2 in the case of an exit from the basin of attraction of a deterministically stable fixed point the time t over which the exit occurs clearly plays an important role in determining the 8 probability of exit if is the basin of attraction of a fixed point u 0 then lim 0 2 logp u t min u t st u t lim 0 2 logp te t min u s s t st u t where te min t u t is defined as the first time of exit and is the boundary of over arbitrary long time scales exits occur with probability one the question is therefore not whether an exit will occur but rather how long one should expect to wait before it does the mean time to exit mte can be shown to increase exponentially as decreases with a rate dictated by the action st minimized over all possible transit times with the action left only as a function of state space one can define a quasi potential function that quantifies the mte from u 0 to any other state u i e q u inft st where st is the minimizer of st u t over continuous paths u t satisfying u 0 u 0 and u t u in particular lim 0 2 loge te inf u q u 25 under broad conditions minima of the quasi potential occur at 1 saddles which represent the most likely points of exit from the basin of attraction of the stable fixed point gradient flows 23 where f u v u for some potential function v u represent a special case in the theory of large deviations in this case it can be shown 19 that the quasi potential between a minimum of v and the nearest saddle point is simply given by twice the difference in potential between the two points one dimensional sdes are automatically gradient flows since one can simply define v u u u 0 f y dy 26 while the above consideration provides the exponential scaling law for transition proba bilities and mean times to exit a more detailed analysis is required 20 22 to improve on this estimate by providing the prefactor of the exponential for example in this work we discuss only the rate function leaving a more accurate approximation for further study deterministic dynamics in the four dimensional system described by eqns 13 through 16 the first three pa rameters only depend on v through the diffusion tensor a complete description of the 9 deterministic dynamics is therefore afforded by the reduced system v i f 1 27 2 h 0 i 3 2 f 2 28 v 2 h 0 3 i 2 2 f 2 i f 3 v 29 the case v 0 has been thoroughly studied in ref 13 where it was shown that multiple fixed points are possible with v 0 depending on the number of roots of h 0 1 2 i tanh 1 ln cosh 1 ln cosh 1 30 where we note that 0 h 0 0 figure 2 illustrates the zero level surface of for different values of the applied field h 0 and scaled stt current i for 7 3 considering for a moment the 2 d system where we restrict v 0 and fix a small applied field h 0 a saddle node bifurcation occurs for i h 0 and the saddle approaches infinity as i approaches 2 ln 2 for larger values of applied field another stable fixed point bifurcates from infinity either before or after the original saddle node bifurcation to collide with and annihilate the saddle as i is increased since sgn f 1 sgn see appendix fixed points satisfy v 0 if and only if 0 centered droplet solitons depicted in the left image of fig 1 satisfy v 0 while non centered droplet solitons depicted in the right image satisfy 6 0 and v 6 0 the full stability of the centered fixed points is dictated by the jacobian evaluated at 0 0 j 1 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 3 31 where 1 1 2 i sech 2 1 32 2 1 h 0 1 2 i tanh 1 tanh 1 33 3 2 1 2 2 34 bifurcation to the drift instability

manifold is 3 1 0 1 2 i sech 2 1 36 providing an indication of the ejection mechanism associated with the drift instability analysis of non centered fixed points with v 6 0 6 0 is greatly simplified by the fact that they satisfy a two dimensional algebraic system i h 0 2 f 2 0 37 i 2 h 0 1 f 3 0 38 with the velocity then provided by v i f 1 39 11 fig 3 phase diagram of non centered fixed points plotted vs and and color coded by stability green is stable red and magenta correspond to one and two dimensional unstable manifolds respectively whitespace region corresponds to unphysical i e negative values of i or h 0 slight pixelation for small and large values of reflect lower resolution of computational grid in those regions rather than computing fixed points v associated with relevant parameter combina tions i h 0 it is convenient to compute the unique parameter sets i h 0 associated with each potential fixed point in the plane and verify that the parameters are within the appropriate asymptotic regime for perturbation theory to be applicable thus the sub set of non centered fixed points plotted in fig 3 versus and that correspond to physically relevant values of i and h 0 result in figs 4 5 and 6 each of these images is in fact a sur face resolved through a set of points using the method described above where the uniform grid defined in the plane is plainly visible the color coded points indicate stability 12 with green denoting stable fixed points red denoting fixed points with a one dimensional unstable manifold referred to here as 1 saddles and magenta denoting fixed points with a two dimensional unstable manifold the i h 0 plane at the base of each graph illus trates the dashed lines i h 0 which provides an approximate lower bound for existence of the centered equilibrium and the value i 2 h 0 the solid line is the drift bifurcation curve computable using eqn 35 from which it can be seen that all non centered fixed points emerge at small values of h 0 the bifurcation is supercritical in i such that the centered equilibrium immediately transfers its stability to the new non centered equilibrium for larger values of h 0 however the bifurcation is subcritical in i with a sheet of sad dles having only one unstable direction in close proximity to the stable centered equilibria these present the primary ejection mechanism when thermal effects are included and will be discussed in the next section an alternative to the strategy above for solving eqns 37 and 38 that provides additional insight is to consider them asymptotically for large and small i e the regime of validity for eqns 27 through 29 we observe in that case that the support of each integral lies in the intersection between the circular disk of radius and a washer with o 1 width and central radius 1 with the disk and washer centers separated by as depicted in fig 7 the two points of intersection lie at angles satisfying cos 2 2 1 2 2 so that by moving into droplet centered coordinates we have x sech 2 1 du 2 sech 2 1 d d 40 4 41 where 0 by construction the implicit assumption in this construction is that the disk and annulus have nontrivial intersection which approximately equates to the condition 1 42 treating the remaining integrals similarly we have that i h 0 43 i 2 h 0 1 2 sin 2 44 13 fig 4 families of non centered fixed points color coded by stability green is stable red and magenta correspond to one and two dimensional unstable manifolds respectively for 7 3 each bifurcates from the drift instability identified in 15 solid black at 0 and

including in the region where 0 0 is stable equating expressions for thus gives sin 2 2 h 0 i 45 from eqn 43 we require that h 0 i so that 0 2 46 which confines the droplet center to within the nanocontact see fig 7 thus h 0 i 2 h 0 47 for existence of this fixed point figures 4 through 6 clearly demonstrate that the surface of fixed points emerging from the drift bifurcation accumulates within this region moreover 14 fig 5 graph of values associated with the fixed points depicted in fig 4 emerging from at the drift bifurcation curve and accumulating in the region identified in eqn 47 color coding is the same as in figs 3 and 4 it is only within this region that the drift bifurcation is subcritical such that the region where a stable fixed point coexists with a saddle point associated with the drift mode is the intersection of 47 and the half plane bounded by 35 the unique solution for produces non centered fixed points with approximate values v i 1 h 0 and 48 v 2 sin 2 2 v cos v 49 both of these quantities are positive the associated parallel velocity is provided by vv 2 i sin 50 which is well approximated near the critical line i h 0 by vv i i h 0 1 51 15 fig 6 graph of v values associated with the fixed points depicted in fig 4 emerging from v 0 at the drift bifurcation curve and accumulating in the region identified in eqn 47 color coding is the same as in figs 3 and 4 the perpendicular velocity v associated with non centered fixed points is v 0 hence for each v v vv fixed point there is a corresponding collection of fixed points for the original six dimensional dynamical system 7 10 with droplet positions on the circle v having identified all centered and non centered fixed points we now turn to the calculation of the action of paths connecting them action and optimal paths in the limit of vanishing noise strength exits from the basin of attraction of a stable fixed point collapse at an exponentially growing probability onto paths that lead to the nearest 1 saddle where proximity is defined using a metric weighted by the diffusion tensor in the four dimensional system given by eqns 13 through 16 there are two candidates for the saddle that represent the most likely exit point either a decay mode or a drift mode we 16 fig 7 illustration of geometry used in asymptotic approximation of non centered fixed point soliton nanocontact interaction only occurs in the portion of the annular region droplet soliton that lies inside the zero centered circle nanocontact study these in turn to identify their associated limiting exit rates the first saddle is that identified at v 0 for values of i that lie between the saddle node bifurcation occurring at approximately i h 0 and the value of i where the saddle either runs off to infinity for small values of h 0 or is destroyed in a saddle node bifurcation with another stable fixed point for sufficiently large values of h 0 labelling the centered stable fixed point by 0 0 and the saddle by 0 s 0 we postulate based on the form of the action 24 and numerical results that optimal paths connecting these two fixed points with optimal action s satisfy v 0 dependence of the diffusion tensor on the state variables precludes a definite statement that this is true but we have observed it in all cases we have computed since this exit mechanism occurs strictly via changes in thereby mimicking the impact of damping on solitons 13 we refer to it as a decay mode of exit if we assume this to be true the action collapses to s ldt with l 2 5 2 2 52 where by construction 0 if s and equality holds only at the endpoints as explained on p 9 one dimensional flows are trivially gradient flows and it is immediate 17 that optimal paths satisfy 2 53 which integrates to give the wentzell freidlin action s q s q 54 where q is the quasi potential defined by q 8 3 d 4 h 0 i 2 2 i ln cosh 1 cosh i i 2 li 2 e 2 1 li 2 e 2 li 2 e 2 2 12 55 with li 2 z the dilogarithm function defined by li 2 z z 0 ln 1 t dt t 56 the quasi potential 55 has been defined such that lim q 0 as explained earlier depending on the parameters h 0 and i the saddle point 0 s 0 may not exist in these cases we identify an exit via the decay mode with such that the associated wentzell freidlin action simplifies to s q as illustrated in fig 8 expression 55 for the quasipotential q blows up as 0 this is expected since the noise strength goes to zero as 0 figure 9 depicts the wentzell freidlin action 54 for different relative stt currents i and different applied magnetic fields h 0 moving from the dotted line which provides a lower bound on values of i for which the centered droplet exists toward the solid line at which the centered droplet loses stability via the drift bifurcation the mte is observed to increase very quickly becoming effectively infinite for parameters not within a very small margin of the dotted line computing the minimum action between the stable fixed point and the saddle with nonzero velocity requires in principle consideration of the four dimensional system given by eqns 13 through 16 due to the dependence of the diffusion tensor given by eqn 17 on v the contribution from nonzero v is expected to be negligible because v 0 at all fixed points however for simplicity we therefore restrict our computations to the minimizers of the action restricted to three dimensional dynamics giving s 1 2 u f u t u u t 1 u f u dt 57 18 fig 8 quasipotential given in eqn 55 for 7 3 i 6 h 0 5 6 green star and red s denote stable fixed point and saddle respectively q blows up as 0 fig 9 log of mte in dimensionless time units corresponding to annihilation of the droplet soliton via noise induced damping except for parameters close to the dotted line approximating the existence boundary for the stable centered fixed point the mte from this damping mechanism is effectively infinite 19 where u v f v i f 1 2 h 0 i 3 2 f 2 2 h 0 3 i 2 2 f 2 i f 3 v 58 the diffusion tensor appearing in eqn 57 is t 1 2 0 0 0 5 2 4 v 0 4 v 5 9 4 3 v 2 59 the drift f u is not in general either gradient or trivially non gradient and the action must therefore be computed numerically the left image in fig 10 depicts the approximate mte obtained by using 25 with the action computed using the generalized minimum action method or gmam see ref 23 for details at parameter values where the base stationary state is stable and coexists with the saddle corresponding to the drift mode as explained on p 14 and observed in figs 4 through 6 for a given nanocontact radius this is approximately the set of current values h 0 i 2 h 0 the right image in fig 10 is the approximate mte associated with leaving the basin of attraction of stable non centered fixed points through the now unstable centered fixed point in the parameter regime operable in fig 9 and the left image of fig 10 the droplet soliton is potentially destroyed via two candidate noise related mechanisms the first is the drift mechanism described above where the position and precessional frequency are driven by noise to the point where the droplet loses stability to a transient traveling droplet which is then ejected from the nanocontact the mte associated with this mechanism is plotted on the left in fig 10 the second is the decay mode described earlier whereby an improbable accumulation of fluctuations that drive its precessional frequency sufficiently high as to fall into a regime where damping is no longer counterbalanced by the current passing through the nanocontact the stochastic dynamics of this mechanism has an associated mte depicted in fig 9 it is clear from this comparison that the action associated with the drift mode is substantially smaller for all parameters investigated here indicating that this is by far the most dominant mechanism for exit of a centered droplet soliton over the range of values of magnetic field h 0 and rescaled current i for which the original fixed point is stable and the saddle associated with the drift mode exists and has a one dimensional unstable 20 fig 10 log of mte in dimensionless time units corresponding to annihilation of the droplet soliton via the drift instability left mte from stable centered fixed points through non centered saddle points note that the simultaneous existence i e for the same values of i and h 0 of these two fixed points dictates the parameters for which this calculation is relevant see fig 4 right mte from stable non centered fixed points through centered saddle points this calculation is relevant for a different region of parameter space note that the exit times associated with this droplet annihilation mechanism are much lower than the exit times shown in fig 9 and these events are therefore much more likely to be observed on any finite time scale manifold as discussed earlier this is true for a subset of rescaled current values satisfying i 2 h 0 for large current but small external field h 0 where the non centered fixed points are stable it appears that the only exit mechanism for those non centered droplets is through the centered saddle point with a mte somewhat higher than the exit times associated with annihilation of centered droplets see fig 10 right for the mte associated with this ejection mechanism conclusions perturbation theory for a droplet soliton that experiences uniform magnetic damping local spin transfer torque via a nanocontact a vertical applied field and thermal fluctua tions results in a six dimensional system of stochastic ordinary differential equations in this paper we have reduced this system to an equivalent in the deterministic case or ap proximately equivalent in the stochastic case three dimensional system that is amenable 21 to detailed analysis we completely determined the nature of the fixed points for this dynamical system one family of fixed points called nanocontact centered exist and are deterministically stable in a restricted regime of current and applied field these fixed points represent dissipative droplet solitons centered within the nanocontact and precessing at a fixed frequency in addition to previously studied nanocontact centered fixed points we also identify a new class of non centered fixed points these latter fixed points correspond to droplet solitons whose centers are displaced relative to the center of the nanocontact with the resulting force balanced by an anisotropy in the soliton s in plane magnetization these non centered fixed points are stable in an appropriate parameter regime but we have not found any parameters at which the centered and non centered droplet solitons are simul taneously stable by combining our fixed point analysis with large deviation theory we identify the mostly likely path through phase space along which a droplet subject to weak thermal noise is expected to decay a direct computation of the wentzell freidlin action shows that the most likely decay process for stochastically perturbed centered droplet fixed points is to drift out of the nanocontact the computed action also provides an estimate for the rate of droplet expulsion from the nanocontact which sets an effective lower bound for droplet stability in these devices at finite temperature based on the parameter values in refs 17 and 7 with a time scale 0 13 ns the left image of fig 10 yields an estimated droplet ejection rate of 1 e 6 19 mhz at room temperature this rate is an order of magnitude lower than the low frequency observations in experiments that have been in the 100 500 mhz range it is important to note that estimates obtained by computing just the wentzell freidlin action 24 provide the scaling law of the mte in the limit of small noise strength but neglect
