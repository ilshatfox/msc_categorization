3 received accepted published online abstract we consider the planar hill s lunar problem with a homogeneous gravitational potential the inves tigation of the system is twofold first the starting conditions of the trajectories are classified into three classes that is bounded escaping and collisional sec ond we study the no return property of the lagrange point l 2 and we observe that the escaping trajectories are scattered exponentially moreover it is seen that in the supercritical case with 2 the basin boundaries are smooth on the other hand in the subcritical case with 1 the boundaries between the different types of basins exhibit fractal properties keywords hill s problem orbit classification chaotic scattering 1 introduction the n body problem has a long standing history and there are tremendous work on this problem we refer the readers to these textbooks 1 3 it is well known that for more than two bodies the newtonian n body y deng 1 school of mathematics

and is chaotic the problem has also been extended to the homogeneous gravita tional field with potential of the order r where r is the mutual distance and 0 it seems that most of the work are on the weak potential case where 2 and the newtonian gravitation 1 is the paradig matic case among the weak potential case for strong force where 2 4 5 are among the earlier work using the action functional and the variational princi ple gordon 4 showed the existence of periodic orbits for strong force conservative system mcgehee 5 gave a full description of the profile and speed of collisional orbits for the strong force kepler problem the strong force case exhibits significantly different behavior from the weak potential case as can be readily seen in the kepler problem in a recent work 6 the authors classi fied the n body problem in terms of the singularity ver sus global existence in particular the strong potential case has the feature that the critical point satisfies an energy minimizing property which enables us to classify the dynamics nicely contrary to the weak force case this energy variational property fails thus no such clas sifications are available and it is well know that chaotic behavior appears in a more recent work 7 the authors gave a nice characterization of the hill s lunar problem with homogeneous potential it turns out that there are simple smooth boundaries that distinguish colliding or bits from global ones for 2 under some energy threshold while for 2 there are no simple bound aries and indeed they seem to be fractal as suggested by the numerical results in this paper the analytical methods used the idea of ground states which were ex tensively studied in the nonlinear dispersive equation community for example 8 9 this numeric

primary generates a potential r where 1 2 numerical results in 10 sug gest that the boundaries distinguishing colliding orbits and global orbits become less fractal as approaches 2 note that the author in 10 called 1 2 the strong potential but in our paper they are still weak potential among the global orbits it is impor tant to understand which orbits remain bounded and which are escaping we refer the readers to 10 11 and the references therein for more information on escapes of hamiltonian systems and chaotic scattering it is our goal to investigate the initial conditions of the hill s problem in terms of colliding bounded and escaping orbits for all 0 for the supercritical hill s problem 2 the au thors in 12 give a preliminary characterization of the dynamics for the global solutions in particular expo nentially scattering is generic among the global orbits i e g sx has no interior where g denotes the set of ini tial conditions leading to global solutions and sx are those leading to exponential scattering that is any global solution of the supercritical hill s lunar problem which does not scatter exponentially is unstable in the sense that small perturbation leads either to the col lision or the exponential scattering in this paper we will simulate some solutions to support this result lastly in 7 the authors proved that there are no heteroclinic orbits between the two lagrange points for 2 we mention that this is different from the newtonian case where there are homoclinic tangle be tween the two lagrange points 13 and conjectured that there there are no homoclinic orbits either see the one pass theorem also known as the no return prop erty in that paper we will check this no return prop erty for 2 numerically the structure of the paper is as follows in section 2 we present in detail the properties of the mathemat ical model of the hill s lunar problem in section 3 we describe the computational methods we used for obtain ing the classification of the trajectories and present the numerical results about the colliding bounded and es caping orbits in section 4 we study the no return prop erty and present some simulations about the scattering solutions our paper ends with section 5 where the dis cussions and the conclusions of our research are given 2 presentation of the main problem the three body problem is a prototypical case in ce lestial mechanics the system sun earth moon can be considered as a typical example of the three body prob lem using heuristic assumptions about the relative size of various physical constants hill was able to give the equations for the motion of the moon as an approxima tion from the general three body problem the hill s lunar problem can be derived from the general three body problem using symplectic scaling method 7 14 using a uniform rotating coordinate system the earth can be viewed as fixed at the origin and the sun with infinity mass at the positive x axis infinitely far away the ratio of the two infinite quantities is taken so that the gravitational attraction of the sun on the moon is finite the motion of the moon in this rotating frame is then give by the following equation where x y de scribes the position of the moon in particular the planar hill s equation with ho mogenous gravitational potential is given by x 2 y vx y 2 x vy 1 where v x y 2 2 x 2 2 r r x 2 y 2 0 2 is known as the effective potential when 1 1 is the newtonian hill s lunar problem when 2 we shall call v the strong potential this vector field is well defined everywhere except at the origin 0 0 by the existence and uniqueness theorem of ode given q 0 x 0 y 0 6 0 0 and q 0 r 2 there exists a unique solution q t defined on the interval 0 tmax where tmax is maximal definition 1 if tmax then the solution is said to experience a singularity at tmax otherwise we say the solution exists globally definition 2 given a global solution q t if q t as t we say the solution is scattering more over if q t ekt as t for some constant k 0 we say q t is exponentially scattering since the ode is locally lipschitz in r 6 0 blow up is possible only by approaching the unique singularity namely the collision in particular for the hill s equa tion if tmax then lim t tmax x t y t 0 0 3 that is the singularity of the hill s equation is due to finite time collision at the origin 3 the hill s equation admits the famous jacobi inte gral which we shall refer to as the energy e x y x y 1 2 x 2 y 2 v x y 4 the effective potential v x y has exactly two critical points l 1 1 2 0 and l 2 1 2 0 which are known as the lagrange points we have that q 1 2 0 0 0 are the only equilibria of 1 in 7 we define q to be the ground states as their energies are the minimum under some constraint in particular the ground state energy e is defined as e inf e w 0 5 where w xvx yvy 0 6 it is shown that e is exactly achieved by q in par ticular e e q 1 2 2 2 2 7 when one projects the four dimensional phase space onto the configuration x y space the resulting region is called the hill s region hc x y e x y x y c x y v x y c 8 the boundaries of the hill s regions are called the zero velocity curves because they are the position in the x y plane where the kinetic energy vanishes the shapes of the hill s regions rely on the values of the energy there are four different cases in terms of the shape of the hill s regions c e both necks are closed so orbits inside will remain bounded in the configuration space or collide with the origin c e the threshold case e c 0 both necks are open thus allowing orbits to enter the exterior region and escape from the system c 0 motions over the entire configuration x y space is possible in figure 1 we present the structure of the first and third possible hill s region for 1 all the other 0 have the same structure with varied values of l 1 l 2 a theorem that describes the fates of the solutions below the ground state energy e is theorem 1 dichotomy below the ground state 7 for the hill s lunar problem consider the sets w x y x y e e w 0 w x y x y e e w 0 9 then w and w are invariant solutions in w exist globally and solutions inw are bounded or collide with the origin in finite time moreover for 2 solutions in w all collide with the origin in finite time figure 2 illustrates the region w projected onto the configuration x y space and all 0 has this structure for 2 we don t necessarily have the fi nite time collision property inw i e solutions inw for 2 is either bounded globally or collides with the origin in finite time moreover it is difficult to distin guish the bounded and the colliding orbits in w for 2 as the boundaries of the region are fractal as we shall see in the following figure 3 the fractal geome try of the basin boundaries has also been confirmed by computing both the uncertainty dimension 15 16 and the basin entropy 17 for energies equal to or above the ground state en ergy there seem to be no simple sets to distinguish the fates based on the initial conditions but still we are able to describe the global dynamics for 2 see 7 and 12 in this paper we will simulate the no return property for the supercritical case and show that the escaping orbits scatter exponentially as proved in 7 and 12 3 orbit classification 3 1 computational methods for orbit classification the motion of the infinitesimal test particle is restricted to a three dimensional surface e ec const the condition x 0 defines a two dimensional surface of section with two disjoint parts y 0 and y 0 each of these two parts has a unique projection onto the x y configuration space and we will take the part with y 0 for each gravitational power we take two values of the energy constant ec one below e and one above e for each fixed and ec we define dense uniform grids of 1024 1024 initial conditions regularly distributed on the configuration x y space inside the region allowed by the energy constant the orbits are integrated with initial conditions inside a certain region which in our case is a square grid with 2 x y 2 in the hill s problem there are three possible types of motion for the test particle a finite time collision into the origin b bounded motion around the origin c escape to infinity we need to define appropriate 4 fig 1 hill s regions hc when 1 e 4 5 the white regions correspond to the hill s regions and the gray shaded regions represent the energy forbidden regions left is below the ground state energy with c 4 6 right is above the ground state energy with c 4 4 fig 2 projection of w onto the configuration x y space plotted for 1 all other 0 have the similar structure numerical criteria to distinguish these three types of motion the motion is considered bounded if the test particle stays inside the disk of radius resc centered at the origin for maximal integration time t in our program we take t 5000 time units and resc 10 a trajectory is identified as escaping and the numerical integration stops if the test particle exits the disk of radius resc centered at the origin at a time t t finally the motion is considered as collision if the test particle crosses the disk with radius rcol around the origin we choose rcol 10 3 note that we are aware of the fact that the higher the values of resc and t the more plausible becomes the definition of bounded and escaping orbits as a result the higher these two values the longer the numerical integration of initial conditions of the orbits lasts how ever the maximal numerical integration time t 4 is effective based on our theoretical results in 7 12 and the vast majority of escaping orbits need considerable less time than t to escape from the disk of radius resc we choose resc 10 as suggested from 10 in 10 and 11 the authors rely on the positivity of the total orbital energy measured by an observer in the inertial reference frame to validate that the escaping radius resc 10 is safe though we didn t find the theoretical proof of the claim that positive orbital energy implies escaping we point that our theoretical results in 7 12 show that so lutions in w escape to infinity and our numerical re sults in figure 3 match the theoretical prediction hence imply that our choice of resc 10 is valid nonetheless we will check the positivity of the total orbital energy eorb eki epo 10 where eki 1 2 x y 2 y x 2 epo 1 r 11 are the inertial kinetic energy and potential energy 5 fig 3 the orbital structure of the y 0 part of the surface of section x 0 below e the values of and ec are on top of each diagram in the case of bounded motion we apply the sali chaos indicator 18 for further classifying between non escaping regular orbits and trapped sticky and chaotic trajectories of the test particle the equations of motion 1 for the initial conditions of all orbits are forwarded integrated using a bulirsch stoer algorithm with double precision developed in fortran 77 19 the energy integral of motion was conserved in 10 12 all graphical illustrations presented in this work have been created using python version 3 7 3 and version 12 0 of the software mathematica 20 6 fig 4 the orbital structure of the y 0 part of the surface of section x 0 below e the values of and ec are on top of each diagram the main numerical task is to classify initial condi tions of orbits in the y 0 part of the surface of section x 0 into three categories the initial conditions of or bits on the x y plane are classified into collision orbit bounded orbit and escaping orbit for each point in the 1024 1024 grid with 2 x y 2 it is assigned a specific color according to its final state in the following we will explore the orbital content of the configuration x y space in two different energy cases one is below the ground state energy e and the other is above e in each case we choose six values of 7 fig 5 the orbital structure of the x e plane the values of are on top of each diagram the power namely 1 0 1 2 1 6 1 9 1 95 3 0 we choose these values to see the bifurcation from fractal to smooth boundaries between the colliding and global orbits when 2 as mentioned in the introduction for every value of the two energy levels are different and they are taken roughly e 0 15 we call each of the color coded grids an orbit type diagram otd as in 10 21 22 8 3 2 below the ground state energy in this energy region both bottlenecks are closed cf figure 1 thus inside the interior region there are only collision and bounded orbits in figure 3 the otd de composition shows the orbital structure of the x y plane for six values of the gravitational power and ec below the ground state energy e for each for each orbit that has been computed with initial position at the point x y we color that point with its orbital type in figure 3 we see all points in the exterior re gion exhibit escaping motions we are more interested in the interior region in figure 3 top left where 1 classical newtonian gravity we see that inside the interior region both collision motion and bound mo tion are presented in the other diagrams of figure 3 as increases the collision basins increase and fill the entire interior region when 2 and beyond this serves as a numerical illustration for theorem 1 more over the boundaries for collision and bounded orbits become smoother with respect to that observed in dia gram 1 3 3 above the ground state energy in this energy region both bottlenecks are open cf fig ure 1 thus the test particle with initial conditions in side the interior region can escape figure 4 presents the orbital structure of the configuration x y space for six values of the gravitational power and ec above the ground state energy e for each in the first three diagrams where 1 6 we observe that inside the in terior region there are initial conditions with escaping orbit but the vast majority of the otd is occupied by initial conditions of collision or bounded orbits when 1 9 the interior only contains initial conditions with bounded and collision orbits when 3 the interior region are filled with collision orbits again we observe the pattern that as increases to 2 the boundaries distinguishing different motions become smoother and remains smooth for 2 3 4 an overview analysis the previous color coded otds in the x y plane re veal sufficient information on the phase space however it is only for a specified energy value we can use the section y x 0 y 0 that is the test particles are launched with these initial conditions so that they start from the x axis with x x 0 and initial velocity pointing vertically upward thus we can use x e as coordinates and investigate the behavior of the solu tions with various values of the energy e see figure 5 3 5 positivity of orbital energy now in order to verify that the orbits do escape af ter they exit the disk of radius resc 10 we follow 10 and check the positivity of eorb let 1 and ec 4 6 we choose a solution with initial position x 1 8 y 0 0 which is in the escape region we numerically integrate this solution and we record its distance r x 2 y 2 from the origin we choose this position because initially its orbital energy is negative thus it is interesting to investigate the change of eorb from negative to positive with respect to r note that for initial position x y where w x y 0 and x 0 the orbital energy seems to be positive initially thus there is no need to plot the orbital energy in the left panel of figure 6 we plot the growth of r as a function of time one can see that at about t 2 5 the tra jectory passes the escape threshold radius resc 10 and the value of the radius r continues to increase with time in the right panel of figure 6 we plotted the growth of eorb as a function of the radius r one can see that the total orbital energy becomes positive around r 2 0 which is much lower than resc 10 for other energy levels and values of no orbits whose total orbital energy eorb become positive at greater ra dius that resc 10 are found therefore the chosen escape threshold is safe finally we remark that our computations are re stricted to initial conditions with y 0 and x 0 for fixed energy if we take different section of surfaces we will get different orbital contents in the otds for ex ample in 10 the author took the part 0 of the surface section r 0 where r is the polar coordi nates of x y we choose x 0 in our computations because it contains more interesting orbital contents after all the different section of surfaces in the hill s problem share the same pattern that is as increases to 2 the boundaries distinguishing different motions be come smoother and remains smooth for 2 this is the phenomenon we want to explore in the numerical investigations 4 no return property and scattering for the supercritical case for the supercritical hill s problem our numerical com putations will only be carried out for 3 as we have similar structures for all 2 9 fig 6 the left panel is the growth of r as a function of time the horizontal orange line illustrates the escape threshold radius resc 10 the right panel is the time evolution of the kinetic energy eki blue the potential energy epo orange and the total orbital energy eorb green the zero energy level is marked as a black line more details are given in the text fig 7 the trajectories for solution 0 17 all collide with the ori gin starting at the blue point and colliding at the red point the origin 4 1 computational methods we will only study if there are homoclinic orbits at the lagrange point l 2 q 0 0 where q 0 1 2 3 1 5 the energy will be taken slightly above the ground state energy fig 8 the trajectories for solution 18 179 all look like this they scatter we will fix energy e e c and initial position at x 0 q 0 y 0 0 thus the kinetic energy is ek e v q 0 0 e e c since ek 12 x 2 y 2 we take all different directions of the initial velocity in particular we take x 0 2 ek cos y 0 2 ek sin 12 where ranges from 2 2 i e they are shooting outwards in the beginning if they are shooting inwards 10 fig 9 the trajectories zoomed in for solutions from 18 to 179 starting at blue point and scatters the orbit will collide with the origin as studied in the one pass theorem in 7 we take n angles in python they are i 2 i n 1 i 0 n 1 for each initial condition i q 0 0 2 ek cos i 2 ek sin i we integrate the equation 1 and plot their trajectories in the x y plane 4 2 no return collision or scattering we take 3 and fix e 6 4 e 0 066 n 180 the solution with initial condition i is called solution i for i 0 179 in figure 7 we see solu tions from 0 to 17 all collide with the origin the blue dot is the starting position i e l 2 and the red dot is the origin it is interesting to note that these trajecto ries collide with the origin even though initially they are not pointing towards the origin in figure 8 we see all solutions from 18 to 179 scatter or escape for the scattering solutions we also zoomed in de crease the maximal integration time to investigate their behavior in the beginning see figure 9 we see there are turnings for solution 18 to about 21 and for solu tion 21 to about 90 they escape to infinity monotoni cally without turnings and for solutions from 91 to 179 there are turnings after all they escape to infin 11 fig 10 the graph for log x t for five solutions from 18 to 179 they tend to straight lines after t 4 ity we conclude that there are no homoclinic returns at the lagrange point l 2 the orbits shooting outwards initially either collide with the origin or escape to in finity moreover for the escaping solutions 18 to 179 we plot the graph log x t see figure 10 after some time say t 4 the graph of t log x tends to be a straight line indicating that they scatter exponentially 5 conclusions in this paper we have numerically investigated the hill s lunar problem with homogeneous potential the main goal of the paper was to show the orbital difference between the subcritical 2 and supercritical 2 cases for the hill s problem another attempt was to support the conjecture of the no return property in the outer region for the supercritical case as well as to show the generic exponential scattering for global solutions for the orbital classification we have chosen several values of the power of the potential and examined the two most interesting hill regions i e below the ground state energy and above the ground state energy each of the hill s region we used uniform grids of 1024 1024 initial conditions that are regularly distributed on the configuration x y plane with y 0 all orbits were integrated with initial conditions inside the region 2 x y 2 for the no return property and scattering for the supercritical case we chose 3 and the hill s region with energy level above the ground state we investi gated the orbits when they are launched at the right lagrange point and with initial velocity pointing to wards the exterior part of the hill s region the main numerical results in the paper can be sum marized as follows 1 when the energy is below the ground state we see that in the bounded hill s region both collision mo tion and bound motion are presented for 2 while for 2 there are only collision orbits in side 2 when the energy is above the ground state we see that in the interior region w 0 both collision motion bound motion and escaping motion are pos sible for 2 while for 2 there are only collision orbits inside 3 in both types of the configuration plane the frac tal nature of the plane was reduced or disappeared as the exponent increased and exceeded 2 4 we also showed that near the lagrange point l 2 there are no returning orbits moreover the escap ing orbits for 2 are mainly exponentially scat tering based on these results we may say that this nu merical investigation serves as a nice illustration and support for the analytical results 7 12 on the prob lem this work also encourages us to study the strong force restricted three body problem for which the hill s lunar problem is just a limiting case it is our hope to fully investigate the significant dynamical differences between the strong force
