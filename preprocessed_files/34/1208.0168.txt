projection of null geodesics of the schwarzschild tangherlini metric in n 1 dimensions to the space of orbits of the static killing vector where the motion of a given light ray is seen to lie in a plane the projected curves coincide with the unparametrised geodesics of optical 2 metrics and can be equally understood as describing the motion of a non relativistic particle in a central force we consider a duality between the projected null curves for pairs of values of n and interpret its mathematical meaning in terms of the optical 2 metrics the metrics are not projectively equivalent but the correspondence can be exposed in terms of a third order differential equation we also explore the extension of this notion of duality to the reissner nordstrom case 1 introduction the study of the dynamics of null geodesics in black hole lorentzian spacetimes has recently been approached in several contexts via the idea of projecting the curves to a spatial surface of lower dimension for example if a given metric admits a hypersurface orthogonal timelike killing vectork then the null geodesics project down to the unparametrised geodesics of the optical metric on the space of orbits of k similar constructions have been explored when the metric admits a stationary killing vector 1 or a timelike conformal retraction 2 where the projected null curves endow a hypersurface with some notion of geometric structure in 3 the authors showed that the optical metrics of schwarzschild desitter are projectively equivalent yield the same geodesics as unparametrised curves for different values of the cosmological constant and as a consequence equations governing the dynamics of light rays in these spacetimes are independent of thus projective equivalence of optical metrics can play an important role in general relativity see 4 for a more detailed study of this topic in 5 the authors consider the properties of null geodesics in schwarzschild tangherlini spacetimes of n 1 dimensions here the projection of any such curve to the space of orbits of the timelike killing vector lies in a plane and 1 http arxiv org abs 1208 0168 v 1 coincides with an unparametrised geodesic of a two dimensional optical metric it is seen that the cases n 3 and n 6 may be related by a conformal mapping due to bohlin 6 and arnold 7 this begs the question as to whether the optical 2 metrics in these cases are projectively related and if not how can this relationship described in this paper we explore the bohlin arnold duality in depth in this context and argue that it does not give rise to projective equivalence of metrics but is something more general which can be described by a third order differential equation we analyse the role of the cosmological constant for these spacetimes and show explicitly why it does not effect the equations governing the dynamics of light rays and we discuss how the zero energy solutions fit in to the duality in section 6 we consider the possibility of a similar notion of duality for reissner nordstrom spacetimes in n 1 dimensions acknowledgements i would like to thank prof gary gibbons for introducing me to this problem and for his valuable input throughout 2 null geodesics and optical metrics ricci flat black holes in n 1 dimensions can be described by the schwarzschild tangherlini st metric 8 gst dt 2 dr 2 r 2 d 2 n 1 1 where d 2 n is the round metric on the unit n 1 sphere and 1 2 mn rn 2 if we project a null geodesic of this metric to the space of orbits of the killing vector t we find that it lies entirely in a plane through the origin endow ing this plane with polar coordinates r and setting u 1 r this motion is described by the differential equation du d 2 u 2 2 mnu n 1 b 2 2 where b is a constant impact parameter null geodesics of gst may then be mapped into the motion of a non relativistic particle moving in an attractive central force f 1 rn 1 v 1 rn thus one may use results from dynamics to discuss the optics of black holes see 9 for a recent application of this idea alternatively equation 2 describes unparametrised geodesics of the optical 2 metric ds 2 on dr 2 2 r 2 d 2 3 2 with 0 2 and projected null geodesics of the metric gst precisely coincide with the totality of unparametrised geodesics described by 3 on each plane through the origin remark according to 10 and 11 the cases n 3 4 6 are integrable and may be solved in terms of elliptic functions for a recent discussion see 12 the case n 3 admits a special solution in the form of a cardioid the case n 6 admits a special solution of the form of a lemniscate of bernoulli with node at the singularity and which touches the horizon 3 bohlin arnold duality the following equivalence between dynamical systems in the plane is due to arnold 7 but it has its origin in a paper due to bohlin 6 he introduces the complex coordinate z x iy and uses the jacobi principle according to which at fixed energy per unit mass e the paths described by 2 will be unparametrised geodesics of the metric ds 2 jacobi 2 e v x y dzdz 4 now consider a similar system in the complex w u iv plane with jacobi metric ds 2 jacobi 2 e v x y dwdw the two systems will coincide under pullback by the conformal map w f z if v f z 2 e e f w 2 v let us consider only conformal maps of the form w zp for now for these maps one finds that v r 2 p 2 and v r 2 2 p p will work setting p 1 p merely interchanges the role of v and v furthermore such expressions for the potential are physically interesting from the perspective of the classical orbit p 1 gives a trivial case but some other cases are of special note p 1 i e inversion which is the self dual case with v v 1 r 4 p 2 takes the simple harmonic oscillator to the kepler problem v r 2 v 1 r p 1 2 this example will be at the core of our discussion and gives v 1 r 3 v 1 r 6 3 another useful way to look at things is to note that if du d 2 u 2 au b then dr d 2 r 2 ar 4 br 4 this seems as though it would be particularly relevant for 4 we will come back to the interpretation of this formulation later the duality between black holes in 3 1 and 6 1 dimensions is interesting one example of this is the two pairs of special solutions au cosh 2 cosh 1 or cosh 2 cosh 1 f 1 r 4 a 2 u 2 cosh 2 1 cosh 2 2 or cosh 2 1 cosh 2 2 f 1 r 7 the first goes to the second under the replacement au a 2 u 2 2 which is precisely bohlin arnold duality the special zero energy solutions are not related in the same way however we will see why this is the case in the following sections 4 projective equivalence now that we have demonstrated the bohlin arnold duality we may probe it a bit further the results of the previous section seem to hint at the notion of projective equivalence in particular it appears that the metrics 3 for n 3 and n 6 may give rise to the same geodesics as unparametrised curves here we present an argument for why that is not the case and explore the true con sequences of the duality the family of metrics projectively equivalent to 3 can be completely deter mined for arbitrary n 3 1 obviously for n 2 the metric 3 is flat gn dr 2 a a 2 amn rn 2 cr 2 2 r 2 a 2 a 2 amn rn 2 cr 2 d 2 5 for constants a and c i e degree of mobility 2 this more general metric 5 is also familiar from a physical point of view it is the optical metric of an st black hole with cosmological constant n n 1 2 c as mentioned in the introduction the projective equivalence of such metrics was 1 we have verified this using the results in 13 4 noted in 3 where the invariance of the dynamics of light rays was discussed in fact we will see later that there is a link between projective invariance and the introduction of a cosmological constant in a more general case it is clear from 5 that in the given set of coordinates the metrics for n 3 and n 6 are not projectively equivalent but of course may be so after a coordinate transformation in general determining if such a diffeomorphism exists is a difficult problem however we can consider the case where just the r coordinate is transformed this is the type of transformation suggested by the bohlin arnold duality if we consider such a coordinate change for the n 3 metric 5 which results in the n 6 case given by r f r then we find that it is impossible to transform both the dr 2 and d 2 terms simultaneously in the appropriate way hence it seems that these metrics are not projectively equivalent even after a diffeomorphism 5 probing the duality the equation for unparametrised geodesics of 3 is r 2 r 2 r nmn rn 3 r 0 where represents differentiation with respect to alternatively we can express everything in terms of u 1 r u u nmnu n 1 6 or integrating once u 2 u 2 2 mnu n 1 b 2 7 where b is a constant impact parameter as before in this form we can expose the correspondence between the n 3 and n 6 cases specifically let n 3 in 7 and make the transformation u u p u 2 p 2 8 then 7 becomes u 2 u 2 2 m 3 1 b 2 u 6 whose integral curves coincide with geodesics of the n 6 metric 3 with mass parameter 2 m 6 1 b 2 and impact parameter 1 b 2 2 m 3 from this analysis we get a clearer picture of what is happening the effect of the transformation is to switch the roles of the mass fixed and the impact parameter constant of integration there do not exist two mass values m 3 and m 6 so that the totality of the geodesics from one metric will be mapped into those of the other however if we consider the mass term as a variable integration parameter 5 putting it on the same footing as b then we see how the duality works in particular the entire set of geodesics determined by the one parameter family of metrics g 3 m dr 2 1 2 m r 2 r 2 1 2 m r d 2 can be mapped into those determined by the one parameter family g 6 m dr 2 1 2 m r 4 2 r 2 1 2 m r 4 d 2 to make this idea more clear for a general n we can recognize this collection of geodesics as the integral curves of a 3 rd order differential equation thus turning the mass term into a constant of integration which can be constructed as follows from 6 u 1 nu u 2 n nmn and by differentiating we obtain u 1 n 1 u u u 2 n u 0 again this equation for n 3 can be mapped into the n 6 equation via the change of coordinates u u 2 2 remark this procedure will work for any value of n as long as we pick p 2 n 2 which is the transformation implied by the bohlin arnold duality 5 1 zero energy solutions as said before the zero energy solution for n 3 is a cardioid and for the n 6 case it is a lemniscate of bernoulli these solutions do not get directly mapped onto each other but we can try to determine the dual curves to obtain them first note that the zero energy geodesic coincides with the solution of 7 for which 1 b 2 0 clearly for any value of n this gives rise to a dual curve with vanishing mass parameter which is just a projected light ray in the minkowski case a straight line thus the zero energy solutions in the n 3 and n 6 cases with equal mass can be mapped onto each other but not directly via bohlin arnold indeed the zero energy curves of the equal mass black holes for any two values of n can be mapped to each other in this way 5 2 special conformal transformation in 14 the bohlin arnold duality of forces is also uncovered as a diffeomorphism of the complex plane which corresponds to a conformal transformation in real coordinates in 2 dimensions all real metrics are conformally flat so from this 6 point of view it does not seem that this transformation is particularly special however by viewing it as a function on the complex plane we restrict our attention to special types of conformal transformation which takes account of the underlying geometry furthermore if we wish to retain the jacobi form of the metric as in 4 such that the roles of the energy e and the potential v x y are switched then we must have the transformation in the form f z zp and this provides a mpa between geometries with potentials of the form v rp hence the duality map lies in a special category of conformal transformations 6 reissner nordstrom metrics and duality one question that arises from the above work is whether a similar notion of duality exists in the case of charged black holes to answer this first note that the projection of a null geodesic of the metric 1 for an arbitrary function r will lie in a plane due to the inherent spherical symmetry of 1 and will coincide with an unparametrised geodesic of the optical metric 7 on that plane the differential equation describing unparametrised geodesics of 7 for general r is u 2 u 2 1 b 2 9 where we have chosen the constant of integration to match up with the definition of the impact parameter from before it is clear from this equation that if we modify by adding an r 2 term then the set of unparametrised geodesics will be unchanged this highlights the fact that the dynamics of light rays in such static spactimes will be invariant with respect to the addition of a cosmological constant for the reissner nordstrom metric in n dimensions 1 2 mn rn 2 q 2 n r 2 n 4 so that the equation for unparametrised geodesics of the optical metric becomes u 2 u 2 2 mnu n q 2 nu 2 n 2 1 b 2 10 now let us produce a new equation by making the change of coordinates u u p p then 10 becomes u 2 u 2 2 mnu n 2 p 2 q 2 nu 2 n 4 p 2 1 b 2 u 2 2 p 11 if there is a duality as in the st case then we must be able to put this equation in the form of 10 for some value of n 7 two of the exponents in 11 will be equal only for n 0 1 or 2 otherwise we require that one of the new terms takes the place of the impact parameter i e one of the exponents vanishes since p 1 is trivial this means that we have two cases to consider p 2 2 n or p 2 4 2 n in the first case 11 becomes u 2 u 2 2 mn q 2 nu 2 1 b 2 u 2 n n 2 this equation resembles 10 only when n 0 where the duality is trivial or when 2 n n 2 6 hence there is a non trivial duality between the cases n 2 and n 3 2 when p 2 4 2 n 11 becomes u 2 u 2 2 mnu q 2 n 1 b 2 u 2 n 2 n 2 which in the form of 10 only for n 1 trivial and n 2 the duality from before in summary we ve obtained the following dual solutions n 0 there is a duality between the n 0 case and the zero energy reissner nordstrom solution for any value of p where m 0 1 2 b 2 is the new mass parameter and qn is the charge furthermore this reduces to the st solution for n 1 where m 0 1 2 b 2 becomes the mass parameter and q 2 n is the integration constant impact parameter n 1 similarly for n 1 we obtain a duality with the zero energy r n solution for any value of p where m 1 is the new mass parameter and q 2 n 1 b 2 is the charge this reduces to the st for n 2 n 2 this is the flat case with constant and the solutions can be mapped into the zero energy solution of any st projected null geodesic by an appropriate choice of p finally there is a duality between the cases n 3 2 and n 2 where the roles of the mass charge and impact parameters of the former are interchanged with the charge impact parameter and mass respectively of the latter however this does not correspond to the dynamics of light rays in some optical 2 metric 8 even though none of these cases gives rise to a duality that is interesting from the optical metric point of view we can still view the trajectories as describing particles moving in a central force of the form f rn 1 r 2 n 1 for constants and making them still physically relevant yet again it is clear from the expressions 10 and 11 that the zero energy solutions can be mapped into each other for any two values of n by appropriate choice of p 7 conclusions we have found that the static projection of light rays of a schwarzschild tangherlini metric in n dimensions lie in a plane and coincide with unparametrised geodesics of an optical 2 metric physically these curves also arise as non relativistic trajectories in a central force there is a duality due to bohlin and arnold between pairs of values of n and we have shown that this duality im plies a mapping between the totality of projected null geodesics determined by a 1 parameter family of such metrics this notion does not extend cleanly to the charged case the interpretation of the duality is lost in the spacetime as n is not an integer 3 but still remains for the classical particle moving in a central force it would be interesting to see if this notion of duality exists for other solutions of einstein s equations finally the role of the cosmological constant in spherically symmetric spacetimes of the form 9 is illuminating analysis of the dynamics of light rays in such metrics does not shed light on the value of so we require other ways to measure it references 1 gibbons g w herdeiro c a r warnick c m and werner m c 2009 stationary
