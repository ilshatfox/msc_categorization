entsyganov yahoo com abstract we introduce a concept of space time holomorphic solutions of partial differential equations and construct a meromorphic solution of navier stokes equations 1 introduction we study navier stokes equations in lagrangean coordinates vt ux 0 1 ut px ux v x 2 with cauchy data v 0 x v 0 x u 0 x u 0 x 3 here t r and x r are time and space respectively dependent variable v v x t denotes the specific volume u u t x velocity p p v pressure we assume that p satisfies the following conditions p 0 lim v 0 p lim v p 0 in addition we assume that p is holomorphic in a neigborhood of r in this paper we continue our study of solutions of the navier stokes equations having analyticity properties the issue of analyticity was first ad dressed in masuda 1 for navier stokes equations for incompressible fluids and was further investigated in a number of papers see foias and temam 1 http arxiv org abs 1309 0229 v 1 2 constantin foias kukavica majda 3 etc the results show that an alyticity arises naturally when solving the equations in their classical form and can be used to study their properties of special interest is the study of complex solutions of the navier stokes equations despite the fact that these models do not have a direct physical significance they provide new information about the equations themselves see dong li and y sinai 4 the study of analytic properties of weak solutions of the navier stokes equations for a compressible gas dynamic was initiated in e tsyganov 5 and was further developed for the multi dimensional case in d hoff and e tsyganov 6 we can point out that analyticity plays a critical role in the proof of backward uniqueness and in the derivation of exact rates of reg ularization and asymptotic behavior of weak solutions see e tsyganov 7 in this paper we study a special class of analytic solutions which we call space time holomorphic the basic idea is to merge t and x in one complex variable by the equality z it x where i is the imaginary unit after that in order to find solutions of the original partial differential equation we need to solve an ordinary differential equation in the complex plane we give an example of a family of solutions which are elementary meromorphic functions on the whole complex plane these functions may blow up have a pole in finite time however they become smooth again once we go through these positive values of time we also prove that these solutions are space and time meromorphic the article is structured as follows in section 2 we introduce the notion of space time holomorphic solutions of partial differential equations then in section 3 we give an example of such a solution of the navier stokes equations and study its properties 2 space time holomorphic solutions in this section we introduce a concept of space time holomorphic solutions definition 2 1 consider a partial differential equation f u u t nu tn u x mu xm 0 4 where t r x r u rl and f rk is a holomorphic function of its arguments we say that solution u of equation 4 is space time holomorphic if in addition it satisfies the equation u t i u x 5 where i is the imaginary unit 2 then it follows from condition 5 that function u satisfies cauchy riemann condition so if we set z x it then u becomes a holomorphic function of z and the following equalities hold u t i du dz u x du dz 6 now we can give another definition of space time holomorphy definition 2 2 we say that a function u is a space time holomorphic solu tion of equation 4 if it satisfies an ordinary differential equation f u i du dz i nd nu dzn du dz dmu dzm 0 7 in some domain of the complex plane remark 1 instead of condition 5 we can set u t i u x 4 if we now let z t ix then we will come to a different equation for the space time holomorphy f u du dz dnu dzn i du dz i md mu dzm 0 7 throughout the rest of the paper we will only consider equation 7 remark 2 let u u z satisfy the equation 7 in some domain of the complex plane if we set x re z t im z then u u x t satisfies partial differential equation 4 in some domain in the plane oxy 3 meromorphic solutions of navier stokes equa tions the equations of the space time holomorphy 7 for navier stokes equa tions 1 2 are the following ivz uz 0 8 iuz pz uz v z 9 we express vz in terms of uz and then substitute it into the second equation vz pz ivz v z 10 3 then we integrate the last equality to obtain v p i vz v c 11 where c is an arbitrary constant of integration we rewrite the equation and integrate it once again z c 1 i dv v 2 vp c 2 v 12 we will primarily be interested in those functions p for which the equation is integrable by quadratures setting p 1 v c 2 0 and c 1 c we can obtained the answer in closed form z c i 1 2 ln v 1 ln 1 v from which we obtain v v e 2 i z c 1 e 2 i z c 1 13 now we can find u u i e 2 i z c 1 e 2 i z c 1 c 2 14 we point out that the functions v and u are meromorphic on the whole complex plane and have the following properties lim z im z 0 v 1 lim z im z 0 u i c 2 15 we are interested primarily in the zeros and poles of v zeroes z k c poles z 2 k c k z depending on the value of c we can have the following situation in the half plane im z 0 1 im c 0 then the functions v and u are holomorphic in im z 0 and continuous on im z 0 in this case the pair of functions v v x t u u x t is a smooth solution of the navier stokes equations 1 2 in the half plane r r with smooth initial data 2 im c 0 then v u is a smooth solution of 1 2 in the half plane t 0 with meromorphic initial data 3 im c 0 in this case v u is a meromorphic solution for t 0 with smooth initial data at t 0 remark 3 equation 2 will have singularity at the points where v 0 these singularities are however removable since v u exist and is smooth at such points 4 remark 4 functions v v t x u u t x are meromorphic in t for any fixed x inr to prove this we use the following identities v t x def v t x u t x def u t x t c x r 16 the solution is also meromorphic in x for any fixed t r this follows from the obvious definitions v t x def v it x u t x def u it x x c t r 17 references 1 k masuda on the analyticity and the
