jadavpur university kolkata 32 india abstract in the study of ad hoc sensor networks clustering plays an important role in energy conservation therefore analyzing the mechanics of such topology can be helpful to make logistic decisions using the theory of complex network the topological model is extended where we account for the probability of preferential attachment and anti preferential attachment policy of sensor nodes to analyze the formation of clusters and calculate the probability of clustering the theoretical analysis is conducted to determine nature of topology and quantify some of the observed facts during the execution of topology control protocols the quantification of the observed facts leads to the alternative understanding of the energy efficiency of the routing protocols keywords mean field theory clustering anti preferential attachment complex networks 1 introduction in selecting cluster heads when a probabilistic method is used then each node elects itself as a cluster head with the same probability in large scale and homogenous wsns because it enables all nodes to independently decide their roles while keeping the signalling overhead low this method ensures rapid clustering while achieving favourable properties such as stable number of clusters and rotation of the cluster heads to distribute evenly the energy load among the nodes the re selection of the cluster heads is done at a regular interval by this practice we can extend the lifetime and minimize the energy consumption in carrying through the analysis of the system the nodes are allowed to join the network through preferential attachment and leave the network or not join the network through non preferential attachment 8 further the nodes distinguish themselves as cluster head nodes and normal nodes consistent with the heuristic definitions implicit in existing random graph approaches the goal of the paper is to quantify some of the observed features of localized topology control protocols simple tree cds rule k a 3 used in sensor networks with the theory of complex networks the paper is organized as follows section 2 deals with the related work section 3 describes the new local world model section 4 gives the organised analysis of the dynamical equation section 5 extends the usage of dynamical equation for the analysis of localised tc protocols section 6 concludes the paper 2 related work the b a scale free network model defines the basic structure that is responsible for the power law degree distribution it is still a approximate model with several limitations in 5 li xiang and chen guanrong proposed a li chen model to modify a limitation in the b a model they suggested that there should be a local world of each node in various real world complex networks moreover the preferential attachment mechanism of a scale free net work does not work in a global network but does work in the local world of each node the li chen model represents a transition between a power law and an exponential distribution as for the formation of widely existent scale free phenomenon in real networks preferential connection is commonly been considered as a key factor taking preferential connection as a foothold many variations of the scale free network model is been proposed during the recent past years for instance the comprehensive multi local world model 12 which requires no global information while behaves a novel topological feature as not being complete random or complete scale free but being somewhere between them the local preferential attachment model 13 that is based on the common senses that people can own information easily from its local community than from outside environment the physical position neighbourhoods model 14 which mimics the actual communication network and appears a degree distribution interpolate the power law scaling and exponential scaling the poisson growth model 15 which sets up the number of edges added at each step as a random variable corresponds with poisson distribution and can generate many kind networks by controlling the random number chen et al 6 studied a new evolving mechanism for deducing the fault tolerant communication topology among the cluster heads with complex network theory based on the b a model s growth and preferential attachment element they not only used a local world strategy for the network when a new node was added to its local world but also selected a fixed number of cluster heads in the local world for the purpose of obtaining a good performance in terms of random error tolerance luo et al 8 studied the theoretical analysis and numerical simulation conducted to explore the topology characteristics and network performance with different node energy distribution the result shows that when nodes energy is more heterogeneous the network is better clustered and enjoys higher performance in terms of the network efficiency and the average path length for transmitting data in this paper an evolving model for wsn s based on the b a model and the li chen model 7 is proposed the primary goal of the paper is to find the effect of interaction of different types of sensor nodes normal cluster head in wsn s the proportion of a normal node in a cluster node s neighbour nodes is increased in this model 3 the new local world network model in order to analyse the clustering of the sensor networks li chen model 5 is used to form the generalised local world model which forms the basis of clustering where each node has only one local connection information nodes connect only in their local world based on local connection information the following are parameters required to explain the dynamics 1 staring from a small number m 0 of nodes at each time step t 2 when choosing the nodes to which the new node connects assume that the probability ki that a new node is connected to node i depends on the degree ki of node i in such a way that i i j j k k k 3 select m nodes randomly from the existing network referred to as local world of the new coming node 4 add a new node with m edges linking to m nodes in the local world determined in 3 using preferential attachment with probability local ki defined at every time step t by local ki i local world ki j j local k where i local world m m 0 t then include a node with m edges connected to the network after t time steps there will be a network with n t m 0 nodes and m t edges this model contains two types of nodes normal nodes and cluster nodes there is only one cluster node attached to a normal node in other words the normal node has only one edge which means that the normal node cannot relay data from other nodes a cluster node can integrate and transmit data from other nodes both of the two types of nodes can connect to a cluster node and the number of edges is limited in every cluster node because of its energy efficiency as every new cluster node joins the network it is randomly assigned an initial energy ei from 0 5 1 the limited number of edges in every cluster node is represented by k max i which is based on the initial energy of the cluster nodes ei and 0 5 1 is chosen as the interval emin emax where kmax 9 is given as follows kmax i kmax ei emax kmax i reflects the ability of having the maximum number of edges for cluster node i then the growth model is described as follows starting with a small number of nodes all of them are cluster nodes they randomly link each other this results into an initial network 1 growth at every time step a new cluster node or a normal node with one edge enters into the existing network with a probability p or 1 p respectively new node is a cluster node then gives it a random energy value ei a small number of cluster nodes would cause many sensor nodes to link to them which results in working frequently and consuming energy fast however a large number of cluster nodes would waste resources and decrease the energy efficiency thus we assume that 0 p 0 5 2 preferential attachment the new incoming node links to an old cluster node that is selected randomly from the pre existing network nodes in wsns have the constraint of energy and connectivity and only communicate data with the cluster nodes in their local area first m cluster nodes are selected randomly from the network as the new incoming node s local world then one of the cluster nodes is chosen to link with the new node according to the probability local ki 1 if the new incoming node is a cluster node then the probability is set as follows ki max 1 i i i j j local k k k k 1 in this case when the value of ki is high the probability that it will be chosen to connect with the new node is higher 2 if the new incoming node is a normal node then the probability is adapted as follows ki max 1 i i i j j local k c k c 2 where ci is the number of cluster node i s edges that should connect with the cluster node on both sides and the greater the value of ci is the higher the probability that it will be chosen to connect with the new node only through this approach we can adjust the number of cluster nodes that are linked to one cluster node cluster head in 9 the authors consider the expenditure of energy in the process of linking nodes together the disadvantage is that the energy in a cluster node will have exhausted in only several rounds in fact the energy consumption is relatively low thus the energy consumption is not considered in this stage and only k max i is considered to be the limit for a cluster node to connect to others randomly anti preferential attachment let us consider a parameter z called the deletion rate which is defined as the rate of links removed divided by the rate of addition of links it s observed that lesser the energy of the node the more will be the probability of being deleted let this probability be denoted as i k now suppose that the sensor nodes which undergo a change in the configuration after time step t have sufficiently large scale we obtain the result for two type of nodes for the outgoing cluster nodes we have 0 1 i k m p t for the outgoing normal nodes we have 0 1 1 i c m p t so the total anti preferential probability is i i k c 0 0 0 2 2 1 1 m t m m t p p t t factor 2 introduced due to mutual interaction 3 the anti preferential removal mechanism is more reasonable for deleting links that are anti parallel with the preferential connection it is consistent with the real wireless sensor networks environment the wireless links that are not active may be removed from the network when the energy of the connecting nodes falls down to a certain level the particular anti preferential removal phenomenon is also reasonable for many real networks now we adopt the form and usage mean field theory 10 11 to give a qualitative analysis for our energy aware evolving model with link and node deletions by the mean field theory let the following dynamical equation is as 1 0 0 i i iki ki ki ki k m m z k t m p t m p t 4 using equations 1 2 3 we have 1 1 0 0 max max 0 0 0 2 2 1 1 1 i i i i i i i k k k m tm m z p k p c t m p t k k m p t m p t m t p t 5 where 1 i ii i k kk and 1 i ii i c cc 4 analysis of the dynamic equation case i if z 0 m 1 ie the new node selects node unless it reaches k moreover the preferential attachment mechanism does not work the rate of growth of ki is as 0 1 i k t m p t the denominator of the above expression is the number of cluster nodes at time t case ii if m m 0 p t this means that the local world is the whole network 1 1 0 max max 0 0 0 2 2 1 1 1 i i i i i i k k m tk m z p k p c t k k m p t m p t m t p t 6 in a network the degrees ki of most of the nodes are much smaller than their maximum kmax i thus similarly we obtain the following max 1 1 i i k k 7 i e putting the value of equation 7 in equation 6 we have 0 0 0 0 2 2 1 i i i i i i k c m tk m z p p t k c m p t m p t m t p t 8 by definition 0 0 0 0 0 deg n i i i k k k k total ree of node total umber of nodes m p t n m p t m t m p t m p t therefore 0 0 2 m t p t k m p t 9 similarly we have for ci 2 j j j c c c 10 as the cluster node will have one such node attached to itself the status of that node is either another cluster head or normal head hence the count value of c is 2 here the above equations 8 and 9 are used to find the values of c and k in fundamental terms then finally the equation forms after substituting the values of i i c and i i k in equation 8 we have 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 1 2 2 i i p k c z m tk p t m p t t m p t m p t m t p t at t infinity m 0 0 2 1 2 i i p k ck z t p t p t t p t p t t p t reducing the above equation by assuming a p 1 p b 1 p p c 1 p p 1 and ci 2 2 i a kk b z c t t t t 10 with initial conditions are given as ki ti 1 by integration we have the solution as 1 2 2 a i k t a b z ct t a b z c moreover to find the degree distribution p k i e the probability that a node has k edges we first calculate the cumulative probability p ki t k suppose that the node enters into the network in equal time intervals we define the probability density ti of as follows p ti 1 m 0 t so p ki t k has the following form 1 0 2 1 2 a t k a b z c t m a b z c hence the degree distribution p k can be obtained 1 0 2 1 2 a t k a b z c t t m a b z c 1 1 1 2 2 a aa b c k a b z c 11 equation 11 denotes the degree distribution function to understand the dynamics of clustering putting back the values of a b c we have the distribution function as the degree distribution p k the probability that a node has k edges is 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 p p p pp p z p p z p k k p p p p p p p p 12 considering the equation 12 an attempt to find the minimum value of z is done by considering the following equation below 0 dp k dz 13 by solving equation 13 we obtain the minimum value of z as 1 2 a b k z c 14 now considering the anti preferential factor z to be minimum during the evolution of the network as the result the value of z will tend to zero by setting the value of z to zero we have the following relation 0 5 1 3 1 2 1 k p k 15 5 analysis of the localized tc protocols a 3 simple tree protocol cds rule k the simulation was carried using the atarraya 16 simulator where the total nodes collection considered was 100 200 300 500 respectively and they were tested for a 3 simple tree cds rule k the output was recorded for average k for the respective node collection considered for various above mentioned protocols the following diagram enumerates the investigation of average k value from the figure i output of the simple tree protocol for total of 100 nodes figure i this figure shows the cluster heads in red circles with normal nodes attached taking the number of all the neighboring nodes of every cluster heads and dividing by the number of cluster heads we obtain the average value of k by similar procedure we obtain the average value of k for other node collection viz 200 300 400 500 carrying out the simulation using simple tree protocol for all collection then combining the theoretical using equation 15 and experimental values we have the table as described below n k n t n e 100 3 37 40 200 3 73

line polynomial options of ms excel have been used to study the degree of curve fit of the theoretical experimental curve 2 there is flip between the theoretical and experimental curve in case of a 3 and simple tree protocol which may be attributed due to the fact that a 3 approximate cds only preserves 1 connectivity whereas the spanning tree protocol has multiple connectivity hence a 3 protocol will require less energy to construct the tree as compared to span tree which confirms to the experimental results b discussion on cds rule k consider the equation 14 ie 1 2 a b k z c where a b c k z

nodes n y figure iii in table iv the minimum value of z corresponds to a probability value 0 5 which indicates that the clusters have dissociated into one clusterhead and one normal node which ideally predicts the case when the energy of the nodes have drained out in fig iii it can be seen that the mechanics of clustering in cds rule k is in accordance to the assumptions considered while deducing the distribution function using mean field theory unlike a 3 and simple tree protocol cds rule k also exhibits a relation of degree 4 as shown the linear graph as shown in the figure represents the situation when the value of z is min this graph is linear due to constant value of p 0 5 here where as other graphs were drawn on constant z 0 here above experimental results lead us to the following explanation of the anti preferential factor z the anti preferential factor can have three distinct values a when z 0 then the effective degree of the node is equal to the mathematical degree of a node here the number of cluster heads formed will be optimal b when z 0 then a node will have alternative connections available here the number of cluster heads will be higher c when z 0 then a node will have single connectivity here the number of cluster heads will be highest as the result will lead to dissociation 6 conclusions the assumptions work fairly well with the topology control tc protocols the significance of using this approach will allow us to understand new approach in designing the tc protocols using the z factor other than the conventional big ohh o notation especially the table iv which have far reaching consequences in understanding the lifetime of the network if at all the average number of neighbor nodes per cluster head can be set through certain mechanism 7 references 1 r
