configuration in the three dimensional hyperbolic sphere is equivalent to one central configuration on a particular two dimensional hyperbolic sphere however there exist both special and ordinary central configurations in the three dimensional sphere that are not confined to any two dimensional sphere key words celestial mechanics curved n body problem central configura tions 1 introduction the curved n body problem is a natural extension of the newtonian n body problem in r 3 to isotropic complete simply connected spaces of constant nonzero curvature s 3 and h 3 for its history we refer the readers to 3 where the equations of motion are written in extrinsic coordinates in r 4 for s 3 and the minkowski space r 3 1 for h 3 this approach different form more traditional ones like 9 led to fruitful results especially in the study of relative equilibria which are rigid motions that become fixed points in some rotating coordinates system 2 3 4 5 6 7 based on the work of diacu especially 3 5 the authors of 8 proposed to study central configurations roughly speaking central configurations are special arrangements of the point particles and the exact definition will be given later the central configurations of the newtonian n body problem first formulated by laplace 10 are quite important in the study of the newtonian n body problem in 8 the authors have also showed the importance of central configurations for the curved n body problem for instance each central configuration gives rise to 1 http arxiv org abs 1605 08730 v 1 2 suo zhao and shuqiang zhu a one parameter family of relative equilibria and central configurations are the bifurcation points in the topological classification of the curved n body problem some questions about these configurations were also raised in 8 for example find all central configurations for n point particles when n is small the three particles case has been recently solved and will appear in a forthcoming paper another interesting problem is to prove or disprove that for generic n point par ticles the number of equivalent classes of central configurations is finite though these questions are similar to those of the newtonian n body problem 11 12 the answers are quite different in general for example moulton s theorem con cerning the collinear central configurations has been generalized to h 3 8 but it can not be directly generalized to s 3 in this paper we put into the evidence another difference each central config uration on h 3 is equivalent to one central configuration on h 2 xyw which will be defined later whereas in s 3 there are central configurations that are not confined to any two dimensional sphere in some sense the number of central configu rations in h 3 is smaller than that of s 3 when we consider the wintner smale conjecture in h 3 raised in 8 asking whether the number of classes of central con figurations in h 3 is finite or not for generic n point particles we only need to study the problem on h 2 xyw the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we recall the basic setting of the curved n body problem and the corresponding facts about central configurations in section 3 we prove the result about central configurations in h 3 in section 4 we construct a two parameter family of three dimensional central configurations in s 3 2 the curved n body problem and central configurations 2 1 equations of motion as done in 3 5 the equations will be written in r 4 for s 3 and in the minkowski space r 3 1 for h 3 for convenience we understand the two linear spaces as r 4 endowed with two inner products for two vectors q 1 x 1 y 1 z 1 w 1 t and q 2 x 2 y 2 z 2 w 2 t the inner products are given by q 1 q 2 x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 z 1 z 2 w 1 w 2 where 1 for the euclidean space and 1 for the minkowski space we define the unit sphere s 3 and the unit hyperbolic sphere h 3 as s 3 x y z w t r 4 x 2 y 2 z 2 w 2 1 and h 3 x y z w t r 4 x 2 y 2 z 2 w 2 1 w 0 respectively we can merge these two manifolds into m 3 x y z w t r 4 x 2 y 2 z 2 w 2 with w 0 for 1 3 given the positive masses m 1 mn whose positions are described by the configuration q q 1 qn m 3 n qi xi yi zi wi t i 1 n we define the singularity set 1 i j n q m 3 n qi qj 1 let dij be the geodesic distance between the point masses mi and mj which is computed by dij q arccos qi qj for s 3 dij q arccosh qi qj for h 3 the force function u u being the potential function in m 3 n is u q 1 i j n mimjctndij q where ctn x stands for cot x in s 3 and coth x in h 3 we also introduce two more notations which unify the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions sn x sin x or sinh x csn x cos x or cosh x define the kinetic energy as t q 1 i n miq i q i q q 1 q n then the curved n body problem is given by the lagrange system on t m 3 n with l q q t q u q using variational methods we obtain the equations of motion in s 3 and in h 3 8 merged into one they are q i n j 1 j 6 i mimj qj csndijqi sn 3 dij mi q i q i qi qi qi i 1 n the first part of the acceleration access from the gradient of the force function qiu q and we will denote it by fi it is the sum of fij mimj qj csndijqi sn 3 dij for j 6 i 2 2 central configurations definition 1 a configuration q m 3 n is called a central configuration if there is some constant such that 1 qiu q qii q i 1 n where is the gradient operator in m 3 i q n i 1 mi x 2 i y 2 i and the explicit form of qii is 4 suo zhao and shuqiang zhu 2 2 mi xi w 2 i z 2 i yi w 2 i z 2 i zi x 2 i y 2 i wi x 2 i y 2 i in t s 3 n and 2 mi xi w 2 i z 2 i yi w 2 i z 2 i zi x 2 i y 2 i wi x 2 i y 2 i in t h 3 n since the two functions u and i are both invariant under the group action of so 2 so 2 in the case of s 3 and so 2 so 1 1 in the case of h 3 it is easy to check that a central configuration remains a central configuration after an so 2 so 2 action or an so 2 so 1 1 action 8 two central configurations are said to be equivalent if one can be transformed to the other by these group actions when we say a central configuration we mean a class of central configurations as defined by the equivalence relation a central configuration with 0 is called a special central configuration which only occurs in s 3 3 otherwise it is called an ordinary central configuration a central configuration lying on a geodesic is called a geodesic central configuration a central configuration lying on a two dimensional sphere is called an s 2 central configuration a central configuration lying on a two dimensional hyperbolic sphere is called an h 2 central configuration all the other central configurations are called three dimensional central configurations here a two dimensional sphere hyperbolic sphere means a sphere hyperbolic sphere isometric to the unit sphere hyperbolic sphere in r 3 r 2 1 it is the non empty intersection of m 3 with a three dimensional linear subspace x y z w t r 4 ax by cz dw 0 1 we begin with the following result proposition 1 let v x y z w t r 4 cz dw 0 if a configuration q q 1 qn lies on the two dimensional sphere hyperbolic sphere v m 3 then qii is in v for i 1 n proof by the explicit form of qii equation 2 we get qii 0 0 c d t 2 mi x 2 i y 2 i czi dwi 0 this equation completes the proof 3 central configurations on h 3 let us define h 2 xyw x y z w t r 4 z 0 h 3 we can prove the following result theorem 1 each central configuration in h 3 is equivalent to some central con figuration on h 2 xyw proof we first show that all central configurations in h 3 must lie on a two dimensional hyperbolic sphere then we show that there is some action 5 so 2 so 1 1 which transforms that hyperbolic sphere to h 2 xyw thus by the definition of equivalent central configurations each central configuration in h 3 is equivalent to some central configuration on h 2 xyw consider the two dimensional hyperbolic sphere h 2 x y z w t r 4 cosh z sinh w 0 h 3 the intersection is not empty since the linear subspace and h 3 share the point 0 0 sinh cosh t we show that each central configuration will be confined to only one such two dimensional hyperbolic sphere assume that this is not the case suppose that there is a central configuration q q 1 qn with qi h 2 i 1 i for i 6 1 and there is at least one i such that 1 i then qi can be written as xi yi i sinh i i cosh i t with i 0 since wi i cosh i 0 by proposition 1 q 1 i is in the linear subspace x y z w t r 4 cosh 1 z sinh 1 w 0 in order to have a central configuration q 1 u must be in the linear subspace i e q 1 u 0 0 cosh 1 sinh 1 t f 1 z cosh 1 f 1 w sinh 1 0 where f 1 z and f 1 w stand for the z coordinate and w coordinate of f 1 respectively however using the explicit form of f 1 we get f 1 z cosh 1 f 1 w sinh 1 n i 2 mim 1 zi cosh di 1 z 1 sinh 3 di 1 cosh 1 wi cosh di 1 w 1 sinh 3 di 1 sinh 1 n i 2 mim 1 i sinh i cosh 1 i cosh i sinh 1 cosh di 1 z 1 cosh 1 w 1 sinh 1 sinh 3 di 1 n i 2 mim 1 i sinh i 1 sinh 3 di 1 0 since i 1 for i 6 1 and there is at least one i such that i 1 thus any central configuration must lie on only one such hyperbolic sphere say h 2 let 1 0 0 1 cosh sinh sinh cosh so 2 so 1 1 since cosh sinh sinh cosh i sinh i cosh 0 i h 2 h 2 xyw this calculation completes the proof 6 suo zhao and shuqiang zhu to offer more insight into this result we provide a heuristic argument recall that the poincare ball model of h 3 is x 2 y 2 z 2 1 ds 2 4 dx 2 dy 2 dz 2 1 x 2 y 2 z 2 2 in this model a two dimensional hyperbolic sphere is the intersection of the three dimensional ball with a two dimensional euclidean sphere that orthogonally inter sects the boundary of the ball the hyperbolic spheres h 2 defined above are those that intersect the z axis orthogonally 1 for example h 2 xyw in this model is the disk in the plane z 0 now suppose that qi h 2 i and 1 2 proposition 1 implies that q 1 i tq 1 h 2 1 as showed in figure 1 however f 12 points towards the lower hyperbolic sphere h 2 2 thus q 1 i and q 1 u cannot be collinear z x m 1 m 2 f 12 q 1 i figure 1 a configurations in the poincare ball model remark 1 recall that there are central configurations not in a plane called spa tial central configurations in the newtonian n body problem such as the regular tetrahedron for any given four masses however those spatial configurations do not lead to rigid motions thus if we defined central configurations in r 3 as those that lead to rigid motions there would be no spatial ones 4 central configurations in s 3 apparently the compactness of s 3 makes the set of central configuration in it richer than in h 3 with computations similar to the ones we performed in h 3 we can get the following necessary conditions for central configurations in s 3 n j 1 j 6 i mimj j sin j i sin 3 dij 0 i 1 n 7 these equations however do not rule out the existence of three dimensional cen tral configurations for example we have the pentatope special central configu ration of five equal masses 8 x 1 1 y 1 0 z 1 0 w 1 0 x 2 1 4 y 2 15 4 z 2 0 w 2 0 x 3 1 4 y 3 5 4 3 z 3 5 6 w 3 0 x 4 1 4 y 4 5 4 3 z 4 5 2 6 w 4 5 2 2 x 5 1 4 y 5 5 4 3 z 5 5 2 6 w 5 5 2 2 however all known three dimensional central configurations are special central configurations i e 0 we will further construct a two parameter family of ordinary three dimensional central configurations of five masses suppose that the masses are m 1 m 2 m m 3 m 4 m 5 1 and their positions are given by x 1 0 y 1 0 z 1 cos w 1 sin x 2 0 y 2 0 z 2 cos w 2 sin x 3 r y 3 0 z 3 c w 3 0 x 4 r cos 2 3 y 4 r sin 2 3 z 4 c w 4 0 x 5 r cos 4 3 y 5 r sin 4 3 z 5 c w 5 0 where c 1 1 0 r 0 r 2 c 2 1 and 0 2 such configurations depend on two parameters c and and we denote them by q c it is easy to see that these configurations are not confined to any two dimensional sphere in figure 2 we illustrate such a configuration in a r 3 hyperplane by the stereographic projection of s 3 from 0 0 1 0 onto the corresponding equatorial r 3 hyperplane i e x x 1 z y y 1 z w w 1 z proposition 2 for any c 1 0 0 2 and c 0 1 2 the configurations q c constructed above are central configurations if 3 m 3 c sin 3 2 2 cos 1 c 2 cos 2 3 2 generally they are ordinary central configurations 8 suo zhao and shuqiang zhu w x y x 2 y 2 w 2 1 m 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 m 5 figure 2 a configuration q c with c 1 0 0 2 proof we check that the central configuration equations qiu qii i 1 5 are satisfied the function u can be written as u u 1 u 2 where u 1 cot d 34 cot d 45 cot d 35 u 2 m 2 cot d 12 m 5 i 3 cot d 1 i cot d 2 i note that the three equal masses m 3 m 4 and m 5 form an ordinary central con figuration themselves i e qiu 1 1 qii for i 3 4 5 1 32 sin 3 d 34 8 note that q 1 i q 2 i 0 by equation 2 thus qiu qii is satisfied if and only if there is some constant 2 such that qiu 2 2 qii i 3 4 5 and f 1 f 2 0 by symmetry we only need to check q 3 u 2 2 q 3 i and f 1 0 note that d 13 d 23 d 14 d 24 d 15 d 25 d 34 d 45 d 35 and cos d 12 cos 2 cos d 13 c cos cos d 34 3 2 c 2 1 2 some straightforward computation shows q 3 u 2 f 31 f 32 m q 1 cos d 13 q 3 sin 3 d 13 m q 2 cos d 23 q 3 sin 3 d 23 m sin 3 d 13 q 1 q 2 2 cos d 13 q 3 m sin 3 d 13 0 0 2 cos 0 t 2 c cos r 0 c 0 t 2 mr cos sin 3 d 13 c 0 r 0 t using equation 2 we obtain q 3 i 2 rc c 0 r 0 t thus we can write that q 3 u 2 2 q 3 i 2 m cos c sin 3 d 13 9 by direct computation we obtain f 1 f 12 5 j 3 f 1 j m 2 sin 3 2 q 2 cos 2 q 1 5 i 3 m sin 3 d 13 qi cos d 13 q 1 m 2 sin 3 2 q 2 cos 2 q 1 m sin 3 d 13 5 i 3 qi 3 c cos q 1 m sin 2 m cos sin 3 2 3 c sin 3 d 13 0 0 sin cos t thus f 1 0 if and only if m 3 c sin 3 2 2 cos 1 c 2 cos 2 3 2 since we need positive masses c cos needs to be negative we have thus obtained a two parameter family of central configurations q c for any c 1 0 0 2 and c 0 1 2 the central configu ration equations qiu c qii i 1 5 are satisfied and the constant is c 1 2 3 2 sin 3 d 34 m cos c sin 3 d 13 3 2 sin 3 d 34 3 sin 3 2 2 sin 6 d 13 3 2 8 3 3 1 3 c 2 3 2 1 c 2 3 2 sin 3 2 1 c 2 cos 2 3 which is zero on a one dimensional manifold factually it is homeomorphic to two open unit intervals thus generally q c are ordinary central configurations this remark completes the proof moreover if c 1 0 0 2 then the masses m 3 m 4 m 5 are contained in the unit ball x 2 y 2 w 2 1 and the masses m 1 m 2 are outside see figure 2 this happens because w 1 w 1 1 z 1 sin 1 cos 1 x 23 y 2 3 x 3 1 z 3 2 y 3 1 z 3 2 1 c 1 c 1 similarly if c 0 1 2 then masses m 3 m 4 m 5 are outside but the masses m 1 m 2 are inside the ball obviously we can still obtain central configurations if we substitute the equilat eral triangle by a regular n gon with equal masses and generally they are ordinary ones acknowledgements the authors thank f diacu for reading the original manuscript and making many useful suggestions suo zhao is
