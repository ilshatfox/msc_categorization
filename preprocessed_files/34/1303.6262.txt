criticised the adoption of the riemann integral in calculus courses as follows only the stubborn conservatism of academic tradition could freeze it into a regular part of curriculum long after it had outlived its historical importance the integral presented in the book is justified as follows to dispense with any considerations drawn from measure theory this is what we have done by defining only the integral of regulated mappings sometimes called the cauchy integral when one needs a more powerful tool there is no point in stopping halfway and the general theory of lebesgue integral is the only sensible answer on the other hand a few years before the publication in 1960 of the book 5 cited above ralph henstock and jaroslav kurzweil generalized the definition of the riemann integral so that the resulting integral called here the henstock kurzweil shortly hk integral encloses the lebesgue integral of real valued functions the study of hk integrals of banach valued mappings started around 1990 by the work of r a gordon the strong version of hk integral is called here the henstock lebesgue shortly hl integral no measure theory is needed in the definitions of hk and hl integrals moreover if a mapping g from a compact real interval i to a banach space e is bochner integrable i e if the norm function t 7 g t is lebesgue integrable then g is also hl integrable converse is not true because the norm function of a hl integrable mapping is not necessarily hl integrable or hk integrable moreover hl integrability encloses improper integrals on finite intervals hk integrability also on unbounded intervals in 5 the integral calculus is presented for regulated mappings i e the mappings from a real interval i to a banach space e having left limits in i inf i and right limits in i sup i the definition of the integral of a mapping g i e is based on the existence of a primitive i e a continuous mapping f i e that is differentiable in the complement of a countable subset z of i and f t g t for each t i z because any two primitives of g differ by a constant the difference f b f a for any two points of i is independent of the particular primitive f this difference is written b a g t dt and is called the integral of g from a to b as shown in 5 a primitive exists for every regulated mapping in this paper we study integrability of right regulated mappings i e those mappings from an interval i of r to a banach space e which have right limits at every point of i sup i the main difference between regulated mappings and right regulated mappings is that the latter ones may have discontinuities of the second kind while regulated mappings 2 can have only discontinuities of the first kind another difference is that regulated mappings are hl integrable and riemann integrable on bounded intervals whereas all right regulated mappings are not even hk integrable the main purpose of this paper is to develop criteria for hk hl bochner and riemann integrability of right regulated mappings on an interval i of r necessary and sufficient conditions for local integrability are also presented the main tools are a generalized iteration method presented e g in 8 using this method we shall prove that a right regulated mapping has at most countable number of discontinuities and that it can be approximated uniformly on compact intervals by step mappings with well ordered steps a fixed point theorem based on this method is applied in the study of impulsive differential equations summability of families in normed spaces summability of families with nonempty index sets is studied e g in 2 3 5 the given definitions rule out conditional summa bility so that the obtained summability results are not applicable in the study of hk and hl integrability therefore we assume that the index set is well ordered for the sake of applications we assume that the index set is contained in r cd primitives by a cd primitive of a mapping g from an interval i of r to e we mean a continuous mapping f i sup i r that is differentiable in the complement of a countable subset z of i and f t g t for each t i z this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we define and study summability and absolute summability of a family x in a normed space when the index set is a well ordered subset of r with the help of such families we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for global and local hk hl bochner and riemann integrability of step mappings and right regulated mappings defined on an interval of r and having values in a banach space the results obtained for step mappings in section 3 both generalize and improve some results derived in 6 12 13 see remark 3 1 the integrability criteria derived in section 4 for right regulated mappings are new we shall prove for instance the following results for a right regulated mapping g i e min i sup i we say that a property holds locally for a function defined on i if the function has that property on every compact subinterval of i 1 g is locally hl integrable if and only if it has a cd primitive 3 2 g is hl integrable when i is bounded if and only if g has a cd primitive that has the left limit at sup i 3 g is hk integrable if it has a cd primitive that has the left limit at sup i 4 g is locally bochner integrable if and only if it has a locally absolutely continuous cd primitive 5 g is bochner integrable if and only if it has a locally absolutely continuous cd primitive that has the left limit at sup i 6 g is locally riemann integrable if and only if it is locally bounded in which case g has a locally lipschitz continuous cd primitive 7 g is riemann integrable if and only if it is bounded and i is bounded 8 the improper riemann integral of g from min i to sup i exists if g is locally bounded and its cd primitive has the left limit at sup i 9 for each compact subinterval a b of i either g is riemann integrable on a b or there exists the greatest number c 1 in a b such that g is locally riemann integrable on a c 1 10 for each compact subinterval a b of i either g is bochner integrable on a b or there exists the greatest number c 2 in a b such that g is locally bochner integrable on a c 2 11 for each compact subinterval a b of i either g is hl integrable on a b or there exists the greatest number c 3 in a b such that g is locally hl integrable on a c 3 concrete examples of mappings f g r e are presented for above results when e is the space c 0 of those sequences of real numbers which converge to 0 in every example the mapping g has the discontinuity of second kind at every rational point of r the above results are valid with minor modifications also when g is left regulated i e when g has left limits at every point of i inf i the first one of the above results will be applied in section 5 to impulsive differential equa tions in banach spaces families indexed with well ordered subsets of r are used to represent impulsive parts of considered equations and to approximate their solutions 4 2 preliminaries in this section we shall first present basic properties of well ordered subsets of r these sets are used as index sets of families in normed spaces after defining summability and presenting examples of such families we introduce basic facts on hk hl bochner and riemann integrability of mappings from a real interval to a banach space a nonempty subset of r ordered by the natural ordering of r plus t for every t r is well ordered if every nonempty subset of has the smallest element in particular to every number of different from its possible maximum there corresponds the smallest element in that is greater than it is called the successor of and is denoted by s there are no numbers of in the open interval s the following properties are needed every well ordered subset of r is countable principle of transfinite induction if is well ordered and p is a property such that if p is true whenever p is true for all in then p is true of all definition 2 1 let be a well ordered subset of r denote a min and b sup when b denote the family x with elements x in a normed space e is summable if it has the following properties s to every b there corresponds a unique element of e called the sum of the family x satisfying the following conditions i a 0 and if s for some then x ii if is not a successor then for each 0 there is such that whenever and the sum of a summable family x is b if b 6 and b xb if b if is defined for every we say that x is locally summable a family x is locally absolutely summable if x is locally summable remarks 2 1 the above definition of summability is analogous to that given in 14 when the index set is an ordinal because is countable the given definition of absolute summability of a family x agrees on that of 5 section v 3 i e for a bijection from 5 n to the series n 1 x n is absolutely convergent as for results dealing with ordinary unconditional and absolute convergence of n 0 zn when e is a banach space see e g 12 appendix b next we shall determine the first partial sums and the sum of a summable family x in some elementary cases sup means the least upper bound in 1 if is finite and nonempty then sn a n 0 m m n 0 s 0 a a 2 if sn a n n 0 then n 0 xsn a n 0 zn where zn xsn a n n 0 3 after sn a n n 0 the next possible numbers of are a 0 sup sn a n n 0 sm a 0 m 0 1 a 1 sup sm a 0 n n 0 sm ai m 0 1 ai 1 sup sm ai n n 0 i 0 1 b 0 sup ai i n 0 and so on corresponding partial sums of the family x are sm a 0 a 0 m 1 n 0 xsn a 0 n 0 xsn a m 1 n 0 xsn a 0 a 1 a 0 lim m m 1 n 0 xsn a 0 n 0 xsn a n 0 xsn a 0 ai 1 ai lim m m 1 n 0 xsn ai n 0 xsn a i j 0 n 0 xsn aj b 0 i 0 ai n 0 xsn a j 0 n 0 xsn aj and so on in particular if b sup b 0 we have the associative rule b i 0 ai where the sum of x b is presented as a sum of an infinite number of its partial sums however this presentation is not independent on the order of both partial sums and their elements as in the case of absolutely or unconditionally summable families example 2 1 a simple example of a well ordered subset of an interval a b of r is an increasing sequence formed by numbers b 2 n b a n n 0 2 1 6 the smallest number of this sequence is a and its supremum is b when a 0 and b 1 we obtain the sequence 0 n 0 1 2 n 0 n 0 n 0 the points of 0 divide the interval 0 1 into disjoint subintervals 1 2 n 0 1 2 n 0 1 n 0 n 0 choosing a 1 2 n 0 b 1 2 n 0 1 and n n 1 in 2 1 we obtain in each of these subintervals decreasing sequences which together form an inversely well ordered set 1 n 0 n 1 1 2 n 0 1 2 n 0 n 1 1 n 0 n 1 n 0 choosing a vector e 6 0 of e and denoting x n 0 n 1 1 n 12 n 0 e n 1 n 0 n 1 n 0 we obtain a summable family x n 0 n 1 n 0 n 1 1 n 0 0 2 n 0 n 1 0 1 n 1 e n 1 the above process can be continued in the obvious way for each m n 0 one obtains a well ordered set m n 0 nm 1 m 1 k 0 2 k j 0 nj j 1 2 m j 0 nj m n 0 nm n 0 2 2 denoting x n 0 nm 1 nm 2 m 1 k 0 nke m nm n 0 nm n 0 then the family x n 0 nm n 0 nm m n 0 0 nm 1 0 nm 0 1 nm 2 m 1 k 0 nke m nm is summable but neither absolutely nor unconditionally summable in above considerations min m 0 sup m 1 and for every m n 0 another way is to restrict 0 to 0 1 2 1 to 1 2 3 4 and in general restrict m to 1 12 m 1 1 2 m 1 m n 0 thus n 0 nm is replaced by n 0 nm 2 m 1 1 n 0 nm i e n 0 nm 1 2 m 1 m 1 k 0 2 k j 0 nj j m 2 2 m j 0 nj 2 m 1 7 these numbers form a well ordered set 10 n 0 nm m n 0 nm n 0 satisfying min 10 0 and sup 1 0 1 replacing in the above considerations 0 by 1 0 we obtain more general well ordered sets of rational numbers 1 m m n 0 20 n 0 n n 0 for n 1 a family x n 0 is no more representable as a multiple series the following result is needed in the integrability studies lemma 2 1 let x be a family in e having a well ordered index set in r a either x is bounded or there is the greatest element c 1 in min such that the family x is bounded for each c 1 b either x is absolutely summable or there is the greatest element c 2 in min such that the family x is absolutely summable for each c 2 c either x is summable or there is the greatest element c 3 in min such that the family x is summable for each c 3 d c 1 c 2 and c 3 are not successors proof a if x is not bounded there is at least one number c in such that x c is not bounded because is well ordered there is the smallest of such numbers c denoting it by c 1 then the family x is bounded for each c 1 but not for each c if c 1 c this proves a b assume that the family x is not absolutely summable then there is at least one number c in such that x c is not absolutely summable because is well ordered there is the smallest of such numbers c denoting it by c 2 then the family x is absolutely summable for each c 2 but not for each c if c 2 c this proves b c the proof of c is similar to that of b when absolute summability is replaced by summability d to prove that c 1 is not a successor assume on the contrary that c 1 s c for some c thus x c 1 x c xc because x c 1 is unbounded then x c also unbounded but c s c c 1 whence c 1 is not the smallest of those numbers c of for which x c is unbounded contradicting with the choice of c 1 the proofs that c 2 and c 3 are not successors are similar 8 a mapping g from a compact real interval a b to a banach space e is called henstock lebesgue shortly hl integrable if there is a mapping f a b e called a primitive of g with the following property to each 0 there corresponds such a mapping a b 0 that whenever a b m i 1 ti 1 ti and i ti 1 ti i i i i for all i 1 m then m i 1 f ti f ti 1 g i ti ti 1 2 3 g is called henstock kurzweil shortly hk integrable if the above property holds with 2 3 replaced by i f ti f ti 1 g i ti ti 1 primitives of hk and hl integrable mappings are continuous see 12 theorem 7 4 1 if g is hl resp hk integrable on a b it is hl resp hk integrable on every closed subinterval c d of a b because any two primitives of g differ by a constant the difference f c f c for any two points of a b is independent of the particular primitive f this difference is called the henstock kurzweil integral of g from c to d and is denoted by d c g s ds thus d c g s ds f d f c where f is a primitive of g 2 4 riemann integrability is obtained when in the definition of hk integrability the gauge func tions are replaced by positive constants in this case the integral defined by 2 4 is called the riemann integral as for the proofs of the following results see e g 11 proposition 24 44 and theorem 24 45 lemma 2 2 a mapping g a b e is riemann integrable if g is bounded and is continuous in the complement of a subset z of a b that has lebesgue measure 0 conversely every riemann integrable mapping is bounded a mapping g i e min i sup i is said to be locally integrable in hk hl bochner or riemann sense if g is hk hl bochner or riemann integrable on every compact subinterval of i the next lemma follows e g from 4 lemma 1 12 lemma 2 3 if a mapping g i e has a cd primitive f then g is locally hl integrable and 2 4 holds for every compact subinterval c d of i 9 as for the definition of the hk integral on unbounded real intervals and the proof of the next result see 1 lemma 2 4 if a b and g a b e then the following results are equivalent a g is hk integrable on a c for each c a b and lim c b c a g s ds exist b g is hk integrable on a b and b a g s ds lim c b c a g s ds remarks 2 2 by definition every hl integrable mapping is hk integrable converse holds if e is finite dimensional see 12 proposition 3 6 6 if b the result of lemma 2 4 holds when hk integrability is replaced by hl integrability a strongly measurable mapping g a b e is bochner integrable if and only if the function t 7 g t is lebesgue integrable every bochner integrable mapping is hl integrable in particular hl integrability encompasses improper integrals of bochner integrable mappings regulated mappings are hk hl bochner and riemann integrable in the proof of the following lemma we apply a generalized iteration method lemma 2 5 let g a b e be right regulated then to every positive number there corresponds such a well ordered set in a b that a b is a disjoint union of half open intervals s b and g s g t whenever s t s and b proof define g a b a b by g b b and g x sup y x b g s g t for all s t x y x a b 2 5 it is easy to verify that g is increasing i e g x g y whenever a x y b because g is right regulated then x g x for each x a b by 8 theorem 1 1 1 there is exactly one well ordered subset of a b having the following property a min and a if and only if sup g 2 6 because supg exists it is by 8 theorem 1 1 1 both a fixed point of g and max since b is the only fixed point of g then b max since g for each b it follows from 8 lemma 1 1 3 that g s for all b thus by 8 corollary 1 1 1 a b is the disjoint union of half open intervals s b the last conclusion follows from 2 5 since g s for all b with the help of lemma 2 5 we shall prove some properties for right regulated mappings 10 lemma 2 6 let g a b e be right regulated then a g has at most a countable number of discontinuities b g is strongly measurable proof a let n n n denote the well ordered subset defined by 2 6 when 1 n it follows from lemma 2 5 that g s g t 1 n whenever s t s and bn thus all the discontinuity points of g belong to the countable set z m 1 m b by a the set z of discontinuity points of g is a null set whence g is strongly measurable 3 on hl hk bochner and riemann integrability of step mappings let e be a banach space in this section we consider first the integrability of a step mapping g a b e a b that has well ordered steps i e there is a well ordered subset of a b such that min a and max b and a family z of e such that g t z t s b 3 1 assume also that a b is a countable union of disjoint intervals s thus g is well defined on a b by 3 1 as an application of lemma 2 3 we shall prove the following result proposition 3 1 assume that g a b e a b is a step mapping with representation 3 1 on a b then the following condition are equivalent a g is hl integrable b the family s z b is summable if a or b holds then b a g t dt is the sum of the family s z b proof assume first that the family s z b is summable denote by the sum of s z we shall show that the mapping f a b e defined by f t t z t s b 3 2 is a cd primitive of g it follows from 3 1 and 3 2 that f t z g t t s b 11 thus f t g t for every t a b b in particular f is continuous in a b b to prove that f is continuous at every point of a b it suffices to prove continuity at every point b since f t t a za a t s a then f is right continuous at a if b is a successor i e s for some b then f t t z t t z t s applying the defining condition s of summability we obtain lim t f t s z lim t f t thus f is continuous at s b assume next that is not a successor given 0 there exists by condition s ii of summability such a that whenever and if t there exists such that t s thus f t f t z t z since also s and since t z s z s then f t f s s 3 this holds for every t thus lim t f t f if t s then f t t z t s thus lim t f t f lim t f t this proves that f is continuous at the above proof shows that f is continuous in a b and that f t g t in the complement of the well ordered and hence countable subset b of a b thus f is a cd primitive of g so that g is locally hl integrable on a b by lemma 2 3 using condition s it can be shown cf the proof of proposition 3 3 that f t b as t b thus t a g s ds 12 f t f a f t b as t b thus g is hl integrable because hl integrability encloses improper integrals on finite intervals by remarks 2 2 hence b implies a conversely assume that the mapping g a b e satisfies 3 1 and is hl integrable on a b we show by the principle of transfinite induction that the family s z is summable for every assume that and that s z is summable for every if is a successor i e s then whence the sum of s z exists in e this result and the defining condition s of summability imply that s z is summable and s z assume next that is not a successor because s z is summable for every it follows from first part of this proof that for g is hl integrable integrable on a and that 3 2 defines continuous mapping f on a thus f a g s ds for every because g is hl integrable integrable on a then lim a g s ds exists and is equal to a g s ds by by remarks 2 2 consequently lim exists so that s z is summable the above results imply by the principle of transfinite induction that the family s z is summable for every in particular s z b is summable thus a implies b if a or b are valid then both of them are valid by the above proof thus the mapping f defined by 3 2 is a primitive of g whence b a g s ds f b f a b a b this proves the last conclusion when integrability and summability are local we have the following result proposition 3 2 let be a well ordered subset of a real interval a b a b such that min a and sup b assume that g a b e is a step mapping defined on a b by 3 1 then the following condition are equivalent a g is locally hl integrable b the family s z b is locally summable if a or b holds and c a b then c a g t dt f c where f a b r is defined on a b by 3 2 proof assume first that the family s z b is locally summable because b then 3 2 defines a mapping f a b r and f t g t for each t a b 13 as in the proof of proposition 3 1 it can be shown that f is continuous thus by lemma 2 3 g is locally hl integrable so that b implies a conversely assume that the mapping g a b e defined by 3 1 is locally hl integrable on a b as in the proof of proposition 3 1 it can be shown that that the family s z is summable for every so that s z is locally summable thus a implies b if a or b holds then they both are valid assume that c a b because the mapping f defined by 3 2 is a cd primitive of g it follows from the last conclusion of lemma 2 3 that c a g s ds f c f a f c as an application of lemma 2 4 and propositions 3 1 and 3 2 we obtain the following result proposition 3 3 assume that g a e is a step mapping satisfying 3 1 with b then g is hk integrable if and only if the family s z is summable proof assume first that the family s z is summable then it is also locally summable whence g is locally hl integrable by proposition 3 3 thus g is also locally hk integrable denote by the sum of s z let f a e be defined by f t t z t s 3 3 because the family s z is summable then is a limit member of given 0 there exists by condition s ii of summability such a that whenever and if t there exists such that t s thus f t t z t z since also s and since t z s z s then f t s s 3 this holds for every t thus lim t f t because t a g s ds f t for each t a by proposition 3 3 then the limit lim t t a g s ds exists this implies by lemma 2 4 that g is hk integrable on a 14 assume next that the family s z is not summable then there is by lemma 2 1 the greatest element c in min such that the family s z is summable for each c moreover c is not a successor in particular the limit lim c does not exist thus g is locally hl and hk integrable on a c but lim c a g s ds does not exist consequently the limit lim t c t a g s ds does not exist whence lemma 2 4 implies that g is not hk integrable on a c therefore g is not hk integrable on a proposition 3 1 is applied in the proof of the following results proposition 3 4 a let g a b e a b be a step mapping that satisfies 3 1 then g is bochner integrable if and only if the family s z b is absolutely summable b let be a well ordered subset of a real interval a b a b such that min a and sup b assume that g a b e is a step mapping defined on a b by 3 1 then g is locally bochner integrable if and only if the family s z b is locally absolutely summable proof a because g is by 3 1 strongly measurable then g is bochner integrable if and only if the function h t 7 g t is lebesgue integrable replacing z by z in 3 1 and in 3 2 it follows from proposition 3 1 that h is is hl integrable if and only if the family s z b is summable because a real valued function is hl integrable if and only if it is hk integrable and nonnegative valued function is hk integrable if and only if it is lebesgue integrable then h is lebesgue integrable or equivalently g is bochner integrable if and only if the family s z b is summable or equivalently the family s z b is absolutely summable the conclusion b follows from a and from the definitions of local integrability and local summability proposition 3 5 assume that is a well ordered subset of a real interval a b such that min a and sup b given a family z of e let g a b e satisfy 3 1 a if b then g is riemann integrable on a b if and only if the family z is bounded b if b the improper riemann integral of g over a b exists if and only if the family z is bounded for every and the family s z b is summable proof a assume first that the family z is bounded it follows from 3 1 that g is bounded and that the set of its discontinuity points is a subset of and hence a null 15 set thus g is riemann integrable by lemma 2 2 conversely if g is riemann integrable it is bounded by lemma 2 2 since g z for each b then the family z is bounded this proves the assertion b assume that b and that the set z is bounded for every it then follows from 3 1 that g is bounded and hence riemann integrable on each interval a c a c proposition 3 3 implies that g is hk integrable on a if the family s z b is summable in this case lim c c a g s ds exists by lemma 2 4 this limit is the improper riemann integral because every integral c a g s ds a c is riemann integral if the family s z b is not summable then g is not hk integrable on a whence the improper riemann integal over a b does not exist example 3 1 let yn n 0 be a sequence in a banach space e and let g 0 e be defined by g t yn t n n 1 n n 0 g 0 3 4 show that a g is hk integrable if and only if the series n 0 yn is summable b g is bochner integrable if and only if the series n 1 yn is absolutely summable c the improper riemann integral of g exist if and only if the series n 0 yn is summable solution denoting n n n n 0 n 0 and z n yn n n 0 then g can be rewritten as g t z n t n s n n n 0 g 0 the series n 0 yn is summable in ordinary or absolute sense if and only if the series n 0 s n n z n has the same property moreover if n 0 yn is summable then the set z n n n 0 is bounded thus a follows from proposition 3 3 b from proposition 3 4 and c from proposition 3 5 example 3 2 let yn n 0 be a sequence in a banach space e and let g 0 1 e be defined by g t yn t 1 2 n 1 1 2 n n n 0 g 1 0 3 5 show that a properties g is hl integrable and the series n 1 2 nyn is summable are equivalent 16 b g is bochner integrable if and only if the series n 1 2 nyn is absolutely summable c the improper riemann integral of g exists if and only if the sequence yn is bounded solution the correspondence n n 1 2 n 1 is an order preserving isomorphism between n and n n n 0 denoting z n yn n n and noticing that s n n 1 2 n 1 2 n 1 2 n then g can be rewritten as g t z n t n s n n n 0 g 1 0 the series n 1 2 nyn is summable in ordinary or absolute sense if and only if the series n 1 s n n z n has the same property thus the conclusions of a b and c follow from propositions 3 1 3 4 and 3 5 respectively in view of example 2 1 the preceding example can be generalized as follows example 3 3 given m n let m n 0 nm n 0 nm n 0 be defined by 2 2 then s n 0 nm n 0 nm 1 m n 0 nm n 0 so that s n 0 nm n 0 nm 2 m k 0 nk m 1 thus if z n 0 nm n 0 nm m is such a family of real numbers that the family 2 m k 0 nk m 1 z n 0 nm n 0 nm m is summable then the mapping g 0 1 e defined by g t z n 0 nm t n 0 nm s n 0 nm n 0 nm m g 1 0 is hl integrable by proposition 3 1 according to proposition 3 4 g is bochner integrable if and only if the above family is absolutely summable if the family z n 0 nm n 0 nm m is bounded then g is riemann integrable by proposition 3 5 remarks 3 1 example 3 1 contains the results of 13 theorem 4 a and c as for related results see 10 let g 0 1 e be as in example 3 2 and let h 0 1 e be defined by h t yn t 2 n 2 n 1 n n 0 h 0 0 3 6 because h t g 1 t t 0 1 it follows from example 3 2 that a properties h is hl integrable and the series n 1 2 nyn is summable are equivalent and 17 that b h is bochner integrable if and only if the series n 1 2 nyn is absolutely summable the result a contains the result a of 12 proposition 5 4 1 and improves the results of 12 proposition 5 4 2 and 6 example where unconditional convergence of series n 1 2 nyn is shown to imply the hl integrability of h the result b is equivalent to the result c of 12 proposition 5 4 1 example 3 3 can be used to generalize further the results of 6 12 cited above in 7 a notion of convergence for multiple series is defined and shown to be equivalent to the hk integrability of the associated step function over an unbounded multidimensional interval 4 on hk hl bochner and riemann integrability of right regulated mappings applying lemmas 2 5 and 2 6 and the results derived for step mappings in section 3 we shall derive in this section criteria for hk hl bochner and riemann integrability of right regulated mappings proposition 4 1 given a right regulated mapping g a b e a b and a positive number let be the well ordered subset of a b defined by 2 6 then the following properties are equivalent a g is hl integrable b the step mapping g a b e defined by g t g t s b g b g b 4 1 is hl integrable c the family s g b is summable proof it follows from lemma 2 5 and 4 1 that g t g t whenever t s and b because g is strongly measurable by lemma 2 6 and g is strongly measur able by definition 4 1 then g g is bochner integrable and hence also hl integrable consequently if g is hl integrable then g g g g is hl integrable and if g is hl integrable then g g g g is hl integrable this proves that a and b are equivalent the equivalence of b and c follows from proposition 3 1 proposition 3 4 and the proof of proposition 4 1 is used to prove the following results 18 proposition 4 2 let g a b e a b be right regulated and let be a positive number let be the well ordered subset of a b defined by 2 6 then the following properties are equivalent a g is bochner integrable b the mapping g a b e defined by 4 1 is bochner integrable c the family s g b is absolutely summable proof it follows from the proof of proposition 4 1 that g g is bochner integrable hence if g is bochner integrable then g g g g is bochner integrable and if g is bochner integrable then g g g g is bochner integrable this implies that a and b are equivalent the equivalence of b and c follows from proposition 3 4 proposition 4 3 let g a b e a b be right regulated and let 0 be the well ordered subset of a b defined by 2 6 then the following properties are equivalent a g is riemann integrable b g is bounded c the mapping h a b e defined by h t g t s b h g 4 2 is hl integrable is riemann integrable d the families g b and g b are bounded proof the set of discontinuity points of g is countable whence the equivalence of a and b follows 11 theorem 24 45 the mapping h g is bounded and has only a countable number of discontinuities so that it is riemann integrable hence if g is riemann integrable then h g h g is riemann integrable and if h is riemann integrable then g h g h is riemann integrable this implies that a and c are equivalent the proof of the equivalence of c and d is similar to that of proposition 3 5 now we are in position to prove the results presented in the introduction theorem 4 1 the fundamental theorem of calculus for right regulated mappings as sume that a mapping g i e min i sup i is right regulated a g is locally hl integrable if and only if it has a cd primitive b g is locally bochner integrable if and only if it has a locally absolutely continuous cd primitive 19 c g is locally riemann integrable if and only if it is locally bounded in which case g has a locally lipschitz continuous cd primitive proof a denote a min i and c sup i it follows from lemma 2 3 that if g has a cd primitive then g is locally hl integrable to prove converse assume that g is locally hl integrable given b a c define for each n n the step mapping gn a b e by gn t g t s b 1 n gn b g b 4 3 because g is hl integrable on a b it follows from proposition 4 1 that the family s gn b 1 n is summable for every n n denote by n the sum of the family s g 1 n b 1 n the proof of proposition 3 1 that implies that for each n n the mapping fn a b e defined by fn t n t g t s b 1 n 4 4 is a cd primitive of gn thus for each n n the mapping fn is continuous f n t gn t for all t a b 1 n and fn a n a 0 moreover if g g for z n 1 n then gn t g t 1 n for each t a b by lemma 2 5 and 4 3 so that the sequence gn n 1 converges uniformly to g consequently it follows from 5 8 6 4 that the sequence fn n 1 converges uniformly on a b to a continuous mapping f a b e and f t g t for each t a b z f has these properties also when right continuity of g in z is not assumed because z is countable then f is a cd primitive of the restriction of g to a b choose an increasing sequence cn n 1 from a c so that it converges to c the interval a c is the union of increasing sequence of compact intervals a cn and g is hl integrable on these compact intervals by the above proof the restriction of g to a cn has a cd primitive fn and fn a 0 for each n n defining f t f 1 t f a t a c 1 fn 1 t fn 1 a t cn cn 1 n n we obtain a mapping f a c e which is a cd primitive of g cf remark after 5 8 7 1 b if g has a locally absolutely continuous cd primitive f then g is locally bochner inte grable by 8 theorem 1 4 6 conversely assume that g is locally bochner integrable and let a b be a compact subinterval of i then g is bochner integrable on a b whence the restric tion of g to a b has by 8 theorem 1 4 6 an absolutely continuous primitive h a b e 20 g is also locally hl integrable by 12 proposition 3 6 3 and theorem 5 1 4 thus g has by the proof of a a cd primitive f i sup i e it follows from lemma 2 3 and from the definition 2 4 of the henstock kurzweil integral that f x f a h x h a i e f x h x f a h a for all x a b thus f is absolutely continuous on a b consequently f is an absolutely continuous cd primitive of the restriction of g to a b c assume that g is locally riemann integrable and let a b be a compact subinterval of i it follows from proposition 4 3 that g is riemann integrable on a b if and only if g is bounded on a b in which case there is such a positive constant m that g t m for each t a b because g is also locally hl integrable it has a cd primitive f by the proof of a and f b f a b a g t dt by lemma 2 3 thus f b f a b a g t dt m b a this holds for every compact subinterval a b of i whence f is locally lipschitz continuous the following results are easy consequences of the results of theorem 4 1 and lemma 2 4 and the definitions of integrals and improper integrals corollary 4 1 let g i e min i sup i be right regulated a g is hl integrable when i is bounded if and only if g has a cd primitive that has the left limit at sup i b g is hk integrable if it has a cd primitive that has the left limit at sup i c g is bochner integrable if and only if the function it has a locally absolutely continuous cd primitive that has the left limit at sup i d g is riemann integrable if and only if it is bounded and i is bounded e the improper riemann integral of g from min i to sup i if g is locally bounded and its cd primitive has the left limit at sup i the next result follows from lemma 2 1 and propositions 4 1 4 2 and 4 3 theorem 4 2 let g i e min i sup i be right regulated a for each compact subinterval a b of i either g is riemann integrable on a b or there exists the greatest number c 1 in a b such that g is locally riemann integrable on a c 1 b for each compact subinterval a b of i either g is bochner integrable on a b or there exists the greatest number c 2 in a b such that g is locally bochner integrable on a c 2 21 c for each compact subinterval a b of i either g is hl integrable on a b or there exists the greatest number c 3 in a b such that g is locally hl integrable on a c 3 proof let a b be a compact subinterval of i let be a positive number and let be the well ordered subset of a b defined by 2 6 a according to lemma 2 1 a the family g b is bounded or there exists the greatest number c 1 in b c 1 a such that the family g is bounded for every c 1 this result and proposition 4 3 imply that g is riemann integrable either on a b or on a for every c 1 this proves a because c 1 is by lemma 2 1 d not a successor b by lemma 2 1 b the family s g b is absolutely summable or there exists the greatest number c 2 in b c 1 a such that the family s g is absolutely summable for every c 2 this result implies by proposition 4 2 that g is bochner integrable either on a b or on a for every c 2 this implies conclusion b since by lemma 2 1 d c 2 is not a successor c the proof of c is similar to that of b when absolute summability is replaced by summability lemma 2 1 b by lemma 2 1 c and proposition 4 2 by proposition 4 1 example 4 1 denote c 0 x xi i 1 xi r i n lim i xi 0 c 0 is a vector space with respect to componentwise addidion and scalar multiplication and x sup i n xi defines a banach norm in c 0 define a mapping g 0 r c 0 by g 0 t n 1 1 n 2 i 2 nt nt cos 2 nt nt 2 sin 2 nt nt i 1 t r 4 5 where nt m m 1 nt m m 0 1 g 0 is right regulated the set q of all rational numbers of r is the set of discontinuity points g 0 cf 9 236 moreover all these discontinuities are of second kind a cd primitive of g is given by f t n 1 nt nt 2 n 3 i cos 2 nt nt i 1 t r 4 6 because g is bounded it is also locally riemann integrable by theorem 4 1 the mapping g t 7 e tg 0 t has the improper riemann integral 0 g t dt example 4 2 let g 0 and f 0 be defined by 4 5 and 4 6 define mappings gm r c 0 m n by gm t g 0 t 1 i i m n 1 cos 2 nt nt sin 2 nt nt 2 nt nt i 1 t r 4 7 22 where i m min i m gm is right regulated and q is the set of discontinuity points of second kind of gm for all m n the mapping fm r c 0 defined by fm t f 0 t i m n i nt nt 2 ni cos 2 nt nt i 1 t r 4 8 is a cd primitive of gm for each m n it then follows from theorem 4 1 that the mappings gm are locally hl integrable on the other hand gm is neither locally bochner integrable nor locally riemann integrable for any m n the mappings t 7 e tgm t are hk integrable on r example 4 3 let g 0 and f 0 be defined by 4 5 and 4 6 define mappings g m r c 0 m n by gm t g 0 t 1 i i m n 1 1 2 nt nt i 1 t r 4 9 gm is right regulated and q is its set of discontinuity points of second kind for every m n the mappings fm r c 0 defined by fm t f 0 t i m n 1 nt nt nt ni i 1 t r 4 10 are absolutely continuous and fm t gm t for all t r q hence every gm is locally bochner integrable by theorem 4 1 but gm is not locally bounded and hence not locally riemann integrable for any m n the mappings t 7 e tgm t are bochner integrable on r remarks 4 1 integrability results derived in propositions 4 1 4 2 and 4 3 and in theorems 4 1 and 4 2 for right regulated mappings have also analogous counterparts for left regulated mappings 5 applications to impulsive differential equations let e be a banach space and a c a c a real interval denote by hlloc a c e the space of all locally hl integrable mappings from a c to e almost everywhere a e equal mappings of hlloc a c e are identified consider the following impulsive problem u t f t u a e on a c u d u 5 1 23 where f a b hlloc a c e e u u u d hlloc a c e e and is a well ordered subset of a c with a min and c sup when t a c we denote t t if a family x of e is locally summable and t a c denote by t x the sum of the family x t we say that u a c e is a solution of problem 5 1 if it satisfies the equations of 5 1 and if it belongs to the set v u hlloc a c e u is a e differentiable and right continuous the following result allows us to transform problem 5 1 into an integral equation lemma 5 1 let g hlloc a c e and assume that a family z of e is locally summable then the problem u t g t a e on a c u z 5 2 has a unique solution u this solution can be represented as u t t z t a g s ds t a c 5 3 moreover u is increasing with respect to g and z proof let u a c e be defined by 5 3 it is easy to verify that u t g t for a e t a c 5 4 for each the open interval s does not contain any point of so that u u u lim t z t g s ds z 5 5 it follows from 5 3 that u t u 1 t u 2 t 5 6 where u 1 t t a g s ds u 2 t t z t a c because z is locally summable then both u 1 and u 2 belong to v this 5 4 and 5 5 imply that u is a solution of problem 5 2 24 if v v is a solution of 5 2 then w u v belongs to v and w 0 for each whence w is a solution of the initial value of problem w t 0 a e on a c w a 0 5 7 this implies that w t 0 i e u v the last assertion of lemma is a direct consequence from the representation 5 3 and 4 lemma 9 11 assume that g hlloc a c e is right regulated given 0 and b a c let be the well ordered subset of a b defined by 2 6 and let g a b e be defined by 4 1 because g is locally hl integrable it follows from proposition 4 1 that g is hl integrable on a b and that the family s g b is summable let denote the sum of the family s g define a mapping f a c e by f t t g t s c 5 8 by the proof of proposition 3 1 f is a cd primitive of g it follows from lemma 2 5 that g t g t for all t a b thus t a g s ds t a g s ds t a g s ds f t t a the above considerations and theorem 4 1 imply the following results for solutions of prob lem 5 2 proposition 5 1 assume that g hlloc a c e is right regulated and that the family z is summable then for all fixed b a c and 0 the mapping u a b e defined by u t t z f t t a b 5 9 approximates the solution of problem 5 2 uniformly on a b within the accuracy b a the differential equation of 5 2 holds in the complement of a countable subset of a b in what follows we assume that e is a banach space ordered by a regular order cone and that the function space hl a b e is ordered a e pointwise the following fixed point result is a consequence of 4 theorem 2 16 and proposition 9 39 theorem 5 1 let w w g hlloc a c e w g w be a nonempty order interval in hlloc a c e then every increasing mapping g hlloc a b e w w has the smallest and greatest fixed points and they are increasing with respect to g 25 let us impose the following hypotheses on the mappings f and d in problem 5 1 f 0 there exist locally hl integrable mappings f a c e such that f t f t u f t for a e t a c and for all u hlloc a c e f 1 the mapping f u is right regulated for each u hlloc a c e f 2 f s is increasing for a e s a c d 0 d is increasing for all and there exist z e such that z d u z for all and u hlloc a c e and that the families z are locally summable as an application of theorem 5 1 we get the following existence and comparison result for problem 5 1 theorem 5 2 let the mappings f and d in 5 1 satisfy the hypotheses f 0 f 2 and d 0 then problem 5 1 has the smallest and greatest solutions u and u in v moreover these solutions are increasing with respect to d and f and they satisfy the differential equation of 5 1 the complement of a countable subset of a c proof the hypotheses f 0 and d 0 ensure that the equations w t t z t a f s ds 5 10 define mappings w hlloc a c e by using the hypotheses and 4 lemma 9 11 and proposition 9 14 it can be shown that the equation gu t t d u t a f s u ds t a c 5 11 defines an increasing mapping g hlloc a c e w w from theorem 5 1 it then follows that g has the smallest and greatest fixed points u and u and they are increasing with respect to d and f because by lemma 5 1 the solutions of problem 5 1 are the same as the fixed points of g then u and u are the smallest and greatest solutions of problem 5 1 and they are increasing with respect to d and f to show the validity of the last conclusion let u be any fixed point of g i e u t t d u t a f s u ds t a c 5 12 26 the mapping f u is by the hypothesis f 1 right regulated and also locally hl integrable on a c thus it has by theorem 4 1 a cd primitive f and t a f s u ds f t f a t a c hence there is a countable subset z 1 of a c such that f t f t u for each t a c z 1 denoting z z 1 it then follows from 5 12 that u t d dt t d u t a f s u ds f t u t a c z this proves the last conclusion example 5 1 the cone of those elements of e c 0 with nonnegative coordinates is regular choose a c 0 r let g 0 r c 0 be defined by 4 5 and define qi r r i 1 2 by qi s 1 2 i i m 1 k 1 2 arctan k 1 m s km 2 s r i 1 2 for x x 1 x 2 c 0 define g t x g 0 t qi i j 1 xj i 1 t r then one can easily verify that f t u g t u t satisfies hypotheses f 0 f 2 let be a well ordered subset of real numbers with min 0 and sup denoting c c 1 c 2 where ci 2 iz i 1 2 assuming that the family z is a summable family of real numbers z then the family c is summable in c 0 thus the mapping d u c has the properties assumed in d 0 with c and g defined before consider the problem u t g t u t a e on r u c 5 13 the above proof shows that the hypotheses of theorem 5 2 are valid when f t u g t u t and d u c thus problem 5 13 has the smallest and greatest solutions competing interests the author declares that he has no competing interests author s contributions the work is realized by the author 27 references 1 a boccuto and a r
