fberezovskaya howard edu 2 national centre for biotechnology information nih bethesda md 20894 usa email karev ncbi nlm nih gov abstract we propose and study a mathematical model that qualitatively reproduces several ancient ornamental designs than one can see in historical museums of crete and athens the designs contain several rings that circumscribe a fixed number of flowers centers or spirals specific to each design the model is based on a complex differential equation of weak resonance arnold 1977 we analyze the role of the model parameters in giving rise to different peculiarities of the repeated designs in particular the dynamical indeterminacy the model allows tracing design changes under parameter variation as well as to construct some new ornamental designs we discuss how observed ornamental design may reflect some philosophical ideas of ancient inhabitants of greece 2 introduction 1 1 the model as an equation with complex variable clear patterns exist in ancient ornamental designs such as the ones that one can see in historical museums of crete and athens see examples in appendix 3 the designs contain bands of different but fixed numbers of flowers mathematically centroids or spirals spider nets and various types of cycles up to stars see below the definitions boundaries of the bands may be smooth or star shaped curves the bands are connected by smooth lines these designs reminded us of some phase portraits of quasi hamiltonian dynamical systems invariant under rotations by the specific angles n with integer see appendix 3 figures 2 3 5 the aim of this paper is to find the simplest mathematical model that can describe key features of these ornaments to this end we consider the equation proposed by v arnold for analysis the problem loss of stability of self sustained oscillations see 2 3 and references therein the arnold equation is a complex differential equation that describes an equivariant vector field i e symmetric vector field invariant with respect to rotation to the angle 1 1 where is a point in the complex plane integer the function is given by the formula 1 2 where integer evidently equation 1 1 has equilibrium for any and are its eigenvalues the equation can have also peripheral equilibria if for some originally equation 1 1 was constructed for describing the loss of stability of self oscillations in maps equation 1 1 is an approximation of maps under strong resonance if n 1 2 3 4 and weak resonance if n cases for were studied in 2 9 and discussed in many other works see for example 10 using both analytical and numerical methods of bifurcation theory to the best of our knowledge cases of are still not investigated completely 3 the main problem considered in 2 3 was description of phase parameter portraits of equation 1 1 in a neighborhood of co dimension 2 bifurcation for specifically the goal was to reveal sequences of all co dimension 1 bifurcations that arise in the vicinity of for any fixed coefficients notably all cases demonstrate essentially different phase behaviors and corresponding equations have different organizing centers in what follows we consider cases for 4 and show that equation 1 1 demonstrates different kinds of phase behaviors depending on whether n is even or odd we analyze the role of parameters b and for even or odd s in the genesis of patterns and repeated designs for different n phase portraits of the equation with n 4 have patterns that mimic the qualitative features of some of greek ornamental designs figures of appendix 2 show several phase portraits of equation 1 1 for different n all of these portraits contain some of the four main types of annular patterns observed in greek ornamental designs definitions see figure 1 1 n cycle is a separatrix limit cycle composed of n saddles connected by their separatrices we call it an n star if it is not convex and convex n cycle otherwise centroid is a pattern composed of a center or spiral equilibrium together with a set of orbits around it n flower ring is a pattern consisting of n centroids and n saddles together with their separatrices each centroid is placed inside the leaf composed by a separatrix cycle or separatrix loop spider net is a pattern consisting of one or two neighboring saddles together with their separatrices outgoing to infinity and hyperbolic shape orbits between the separatrices next we show below that for a wide range of parameters equation 1 1 is hamiltonian and its phase portraits represent certain collections unions of patterns described above detailed descriptions of phase portraits of hamiltonian system are given in s 3 we also present some portraits which cannot be reproduced by hamiltonian equations but can be considered as portraits of hamiltonian equation under small variations of its coefficients 4 statement a for any integer and small values of parameters the phase parameter portrait of equation 1 1 can contain the four patterns defined above in discussion we try to explain and comment on the dynamical indeterminacy that to us is the most interesting peculiarity of the greek designs in terms of dynamical systems it implies the presence of domains in the phase plane such that the system shows essentially different limiting behaviors for close initial values for example we observe such domains in figures a 2 7 8 where trajectories from the neighborhood of the origin b or the limit cycle a can reach any of the peripheral points figure 1 1 example of model 1 1 with n 5 the phase portrait contains centroids around o and five peripheral equilibria the peripheral equilibria compose one 5 flower ring bounded by 2 separatrix cycles any two neighboring saddles contain spider nets 2 some properties of the model 2 1 the equation in different coordinate systems in order to analyze equation 1 1 it is convenient to cast it in both polar and the descartes coordinates 5 in polar coordinates equation 1 1 becomes the following system 2 1 in coordinates equation 1 1 becomes the following system 2 2 where are polynomials of 1 th order such that rotating the phase plane by angle such that we can rewrite systems 2 1 and 2 2 correspondingly as follows 2 3 where and 2 4 notice that 2 5 where 6 equation 1 1 as well systems 2 3 and 2 4 possess many specific properties some of which we discuss below 2 2 case b 0 if b 0 then equation 1 1 reads 2 6 where the function a is defined by 1 2 this differential equation serves as an approximation of the poincar map which was applied to analysis of loss of stability of a closed orbit limit cycle 1 10 let us recall some important properties of equation 2 6 in polar coordinates equation 2 6 becomes 2 7 in particular for small truncation of the system serves as a model system for the andronov hopf bifurcation of changing stability of equilibrium o 0 0 where is the first lyapunov value the bifurcation is supercritical accompanied by appearance disappearance of a stable limit cycle if and subcritical if accompanied by appearance disappearance of an unstable limit cycle if then the number and stability of limit cycles is defined by the second lyapunov value if then the next truncation system containing term describes the generalized andronov hopf bifurcation thus the first equation 2 7 defines the number and stability of limit cycles of system 2 7 7 for equilibrium o is a weak spiral a center in linear approximation the direction of orbit rotation of 2 7 close to o is defined by the sign of and in a general case by the sign of the direction of rotation can change for where is a root of the function so that the point such that is called a quasi equilibrium of 2 7 quasi equilibria are always composed of a circle with radius such that we call to this circle a quasi equilibrium cycle in the vicinity of every quasi equilibrium the orbits of the system change direction of rotation see figure 2 1 taking into consideration that limit cycles of 2 7 correspond to the roots of polynomial and quasi equilibrium cycles correspond to the roots of polynomial and applying the descartes rule of signs the number of positive roots of the polynomial is either equal to the number of sign differences between consecutive nonzero coefficients or is less than it by an even number we prove the following statement proposition 1 the number of limit cycles and the number of quasi equilibrium cycles of system 2 7 does not exceed s where s is defined in 1 2 figure 2 1 quasi equilibria of system 2 9 with n 5 equilibrium o is weakly unstable in all three panels quasi equilibrium point as appearance of peripheral equilibria for c appearance of a limit cycle and peripheral equilibria for https en wikipedia org wiki root of a function 8 let us study the role of the term in equation 1 1 in descartes coordinates it becomes in the 1 st equation of system 2 4 and in the 2 nd equation of 2 4 here are polynomials of n 1 th power and in polar coordinates this term corresponds to in the first equation of system 2 3 and to in the second equation of 2 3 we show below that these terms are responsible for appearance of peripheral equilibria where k 0 n 1 3 hamiltonian model 3 1 hamiltonian it is known 1 that a system in the descartes coordinates is hamiltonian if its divergence vanishes the divergence of equation 1 1 taken in form 2 4 vanishes as 0 3 1 then the following statement is true proposition 2 if conditions 3 1 hold then equation 1 1 is hamiltonian and can be written in polar coordinates in the form 3 h with hamiltonian 9 3 2 where h is an arbitrary constant in x y coordinates equation 1 1 as given in the form of system 2 4 becomes 4 h with hamiltonian 3 3 where and h is an arbitrary constant system 3 h has equilibrium and can have peripheral equilibria whose coordinates satisfy the system 3 4 the first equation of 3 4 defines 2 n rays where 3 5 then and coordinates of equilibria are the roots of one of the polynomials 3 6 let us consider polynomials along the rays for the same fixed the corresponding equilibria can be only saddles or centers see figure 1 1 a 2 1 a 2 6 because the system is hamiltonian 10 clearly if the equilibrium is a saddle center for some then all equilibria are saddles centers similar assertion is valid for equilibria these properties allow us to omit index in the notation of peripheral equilibrium and consider only points and because topological type of equilibrium e does not depend on for example if is a center a saddle then the phase plane contains n centers saddles with the same coordinates and the number and characteristics of equilibria essentially depends on whether is odd or even proposition 3 let n 5 be odd then 1 polynomials have no more than positive roots 2 if polynomial has m real roots and j of them are positive then also has m real roots and m j of them are positive 3 let be maximal and minimal roots among all positive roots of polynomials and then corresponding equilibria and are saddles 4 every two equilibria corresponding to consequent roots of polynomial are saddle center or center saddle same statement is valid for polynomial in order to study model behavior as it is useful to consider the system on the poincar sphere see for example 1 the poincar sphere is defined by two transformations of descartes coordinates given by formulas and analyzing equilibria in the equators of the poincar sphere as we get the following proposition 4 in the equator of the poincar sphere system 3 h with odd n has n equilibria which are alternating stable and unstable nodes see figure 3 1 11 figure 3 1 equators of poincar sphere a n is odd b n is even using propositions 3 and 4 we can prove the following theorem 2 let conditions 3 1 hold and assume equation 1 1 is hamiltonian then for odd the phase portrait of the equation contains only centroids n cycles and spider nets and can contain no more than flower rings example 1 system 3 h with n 5 see figure 3 2 in this case only one ring can exist due to proposition 3 the right hand sides of system 3 h are polynomial has one positive root if and has no real roots if in the first case for b 0 one of polynomials has one real positive root and second polynomial has one negative and two positive roots common number of positive roots of both is and two of them are saddles line serves as the boundary between two domains of different phase behaviors let for example have two positive roots then coefficients of are for any polynomial also has a negative root 12 in figure 3 2 we present the bifurcation diagram of the model for here has roots additional examples are given in appendix 3 figure a 3 2 3 figure 3 2 bifurcation diagram of example 1 for n 5 domain 1 domain 2 boundary now let us consider the case when n 4 in model 3 h is even then see 1 2 and system 3 h can be rewritten in the form 3 7 let be a peripheral equilibrium of 3 7 then its coordinate is given by 3 5 and coordinate is a positive root of even polynomials 3 8 each polynomial can have from 0 up to positive roots consider even polynomial that differs from polynomials only by the last coefficient polynomial has no more than positive roots proposition 5 let n 4 be even and b 0 then 13 1 polynomials have no more than real positive roots 2 polynomials have the same number of positive roots as polynomial if and if 3 if then at least one of polynomials has a real positive root and this is r coordinate of a saddle equilibrium of 3 7 4 every two equilibria corresponding to subsequent roots of polynomial are saddle center or center saddle similar statement is valid for the polynomial analyzing infinite equilibria at the poincar sphere similar to proposition 4 we get the following proposition 6 in the equator of the poincar sphere system 3 7 has at least 2 equilibria which are alternating stable and unstable nodes if and has no equilibria otherwise see figure 3 1 b propositions 4 and 6 are special cases of proposition 8 given below theorem 3 let conditions 3 1 hold and assume equation 1 1 is hamiltonian then for even n the phase portrait of equation 1 1 contains centroid n cycles and may contain no more than flower rings for b the phase portrait additionally contains spider nets proof of the theorem is given in appendix 1 example 2 system 3 h with n 4 here in this case only one ring is possible polynomial has no roots when and has one positive root when polynomials have no roots if and correspondingly they can have two positive roots if and only one root if see figures 3 3 a 2 1 and a 2 3 14 figure 3 3 bifurcation diagram of the model in example 2 n 4 domain 1 domain 2 boundaries between domains 3 2 rearrangements of phase portraits of hamiltonian model now we consider the how repeated structures appear in a phase plane of hamiltonian equations 1 1 and 3 1 assuming for simplicity that firstly let us assume that all coefficients for any phase curves starting in the vicinity of the equilibrium o result in a centroid i e a family of closed cycles next we need to differentiate between the cases of odd and even let be odd then there exists a separatrix cycle for any fixed and some that serves as a boundary of a family of closed curves due to proposition 3 see figures 1 1 a 3 2 a 3 4 a 3 6 the equilibria in the equator of poincar sphere are stable and unstable nodes proposition 4 so the phase plane contains spider nets see figure 1 1 notice now that the described picture is complete if one of polynomials has only one positive root it happens for example if all coefficients are positive if for the same b some of are negative then the flower ring a ring of centroids inside the separatrix cycles can appear notice that the number of flower rings cannot be more than the appearance of any such ring is accompanied by change of the sign of coefficient for some k it implies change of a number of alternating sign in sequence b k 1 s 15 remark that structure of phase portraits for odd n depends also on whether is odd or even for odd s see figures a 2 4 a 2 6 left panels as n 7 11 specific flower rings can arise which are similar to some greek designs figure a 2 5 let be even then the number of flower rings as well as the number of centers is no more than let if then polynomials 3 8 and have the same number of sign changes in their sequences of coefficients if polynomial has no real roots then polynomials also have no real roots if r has 0 real positive roots then polynomials also have real positive roots so the number of positive roots of polynomials is even or zero notice that in this case the equator of poincar sphere has no equilibria and so the phase plane contains a center for large r if then one of the polynomials say gets one more positive root we can verify that equilibrium is a saddle the number of real positive roots of the second polynomial does not change so both polynomials have an odd number of equilibria the equator of the poincar sphere in this case contains nodes of alternating stability and so the phase plane contains spider net structures for large r lastly if and then gets one more positive root corresponding to a center and the number of real positive roots of the polynomial does not change polynomials both have an even number of positive roots examples of phase portraits of hamiltonian systems 1 1 with even n are given in appendix 2 figures a 2 1 and a 2 3 3 3 the hamiltonian as a generalized lyapunov function a derivative of hamiltonian function 3 3 with respect to system 2 3 is 16 then if where is a small positive number and thus for small enough coefficients the model can be considered as a small perturbation of the hamiltonian one that keeps its main properties 4 on general model 4 1 finite equilibria in the general non hamiltonian case the x y coordinates of equilibria are defined by the system 4 1 where are given in 2 4 and the polar coordinates of equilibria are defined by the system 4 2 where are given in 2 3 system 2 3 has equilibrium o it can have equilibria where the coordinate is the root of the equation 4 3 by solving equation 4 3 together with equation 17 4 4 one can find r coordinates of multiple equilibrium points of the model and then using one of equations 4 2 find the corresponding equilibrium value of notice now that generally in non hamiltonian case equilibria can be saddles stable and unstable nodes spirals in practical computations it is more convenient to search peripheral equilibrium points in a neighborhood of quasi equilibria described in s 2 3 1 model 1 1 can have limit cycles see also 2 3 it was shown in 4 5 8 9 that equilibrium points of general non hamiltonian system 1 1 as n 4 can appeared outside inside and on a limit cycle in 4 5 8 9 the sequences of bifurcations of co dimension 1 that are realized in the system under variation of parameters have been found notice that we observed similar behaviors for general non hamiltonian model 1 1 as n 5 n 6 see fig a 2 7 a 2 8 4 2 stability of equilibria in a neighborhood of peripheral equilibrium point the jacobian matrix of system 2 3 consists of the elements in the hamiltonian case peripheral points are centers or saddles for which correspondingly in the general case if coefficients are small enough saddles remain saddles but centers become spirals it is possible to verify that these spirals are unstable if o 0 0 is unstable domains of repelling of all spirals are divided by separatrices see figure a 2 7 a 2 8 4 3 equilibria at infinity see figure 3 1 a b 18 proposition 8 in the equator of poincar sphere equilibrium points of system 2 3 are alternating stable and unstable nodes for odd the same is true for even if when the system has no equilibria in the equator of the poincar sphere proof of this proposition is given in appendix 1 5 discussion in this work we studied complex equation 1 1 with which describes behaviors of equivariant vector field i e the vector field that is invariant under rotations by the specific angle n more precisely we worked with the systems 2 3 2 4 that are equivalent to 1 1 system 2 3 casts equation 1 1 in polar coordinates and system 2 4 casts equation 1 1 in descartes coordinates notice that systems 2 3 2 4 are hamiltonian for specific explicitly formulated values of coefficients we constructed and described the phase parameter portraits of equation 1 1 as perturbations of phase parameter portraits of its hamiltonian version the value of n odd or even as well as coefficients b and serve as the main bifurcation parameters the structures of portraits essentially depend on these parameters we denoted the principle characteristics of considered portraits which we referred to as flower rings by definition n flower ring is a pattern consisting of n centroids and n saddles together with their separatrices each center is placed inside the leaf composed by a separatrix cycle or separatrix loop see figure 1 1 we showed that the number s of flower rings in the model 1 1 is if n is even and if n is odd we described also the possible sequences of appearance and disappearance of flower rings in the model under variations of various parameters we compared the qualitative structures in the obtained portraits with key features of the ancient ornamental designs that one can see in historical museums of crete and athens on our opinion some of phase portraits of the model and the ornamental designs have many common 19 characteristics for this reason one can consider the equation 1 1 as a kind of mathematical blueprint for these ornaments the ornaments are characterized by rings containing a certain number of points connected by spiral like lines a remarkable property of these ornaments is the dynamical indeterminacy known in the theory of dynamical systems a small change in the initial conditions of the starting point the lines lead to different points and so one can visit all points of the ornament with a very small shift of a trajectory point this peculiarity reminded us the phase parametric portrait of known weak resonance complex differential equation 1 1 proposed by v arnold we found main patterns of the phase portraits of this equation some of them are similar to the ornaments but the portraits may also contain other patterns that appear with parameter variation together with spiral like lines and patterns the ornaments may have patterns composed of closed cycles around centers such kinds of patterns usually arise in a hamiltonian system the spiral like ornamental design may reflect the ancient philosophical idea of harmonic unity of the world where various aspects of world phenomena are interconnected according to some authors see e g 11 ch 2 ancient greeks did not favor the idea of progress in contrast they believed that initially there existed a perfect golden age and mankind in their development down from the golden age are destined to degenerate hesiod this degradation may imply broken connections between different parts of the world causing it to disintegrate into separate parts the process may be reflected in ornaments by transition from spiral like to center like patterns we looked for a corresponding exhibit that shows such a transition and have found it in national archaeological museum athens see fig a 3 1 mathematically this process corresponds to the transition from general equation 1 1 to hamiltonian 1 1 3 1 which happens when particular model coefficients vanish variation of model parameters results in the change of the phase parametric portraits whereby one can animate the evolution of ornaments and perhaps on some level reflect the idea of destruction of the golden age in the language of mathematics and art 20 appendix 1 proof of propositions 3 proposition 3 let n 5 is odd then 1 every polynomials have no more than positive roots 2 if polynomial has k real roots and j of them are positive then also has k real roots and k j of them are positive 3 every two equilibria corresponding to consequent roots of polynomial are saddle center or center saddle similar statement is valid for the polynomial 4 let are maximal and minimal roots among all positive roots of polynomials and then corresponding equilibria and are saddles coordinates of peripheral equilibria of hamiltonian system 3 h satisfy the system 3 4 so a 1 and are the roots of the polynomials where a 2 even polynomial of the power 2 s where has changes of signs of its coefficients so it has at most m positive roots or less than m by an even number due to descartes theorem then one of the polynomials has at most m changes of signs and the second has at most m so for one of the polynomials has at most positive roots and the second has at most now we show that the number of saddles in the system is at most and the number of centers is at most the second assertion of proposition is obvious evidently if is a root of then is a root of the total number of positive roots of both polynomials is an odd number note also that and the equilibrium is a center of the system the system is hamiltonian so its equilibria can be only saddles and centersthat 21 alternates in each ray let are positive roots of polynomials thus the closest to o peripheral equilibria j 0 n 1 can be only saddles that together with their separatrices compose separatrix cycle in plane the cycle contains inside the point o next the largest root of polynomials also corresponds to a saddle because the number k is odd together with their separatrices the saddles j 0 n 1 also compose separatrix cycle in plane we have proven that the system has at most separatrix cycles containing n saddles and at most flower rings containing n peripheral centers proposition 5 let n 4 be even and b 0 then 1 polynomials have no more than real positive roots 2 polynomials have the same number of positive roots as polynomial if and if 3 if then at least one of polynomials has a real positive root and this is r coordinate of a saddle equilibrium of 3 7 4 every two equilibria corresponding to subsequent roots of polynomial are saddle center or center saddle similar statement is valid for the polynomial proof of proposition 5 in this case after substitution we get even polynomials of the form a 3 22 each of even polynomial has at most real positive roots so common number positive roots is at most the equilibrium is the center in the system so the closest to o peripheral equilibria are saddles together with their separartices they compose n separatrix cycle in plane it has been discussed in the proof of proposition 4 that saddles and centers are alternating in the let is the number of the changes of signs of coefficients of polynomial it is evident that for and for both polynomials has the same sighs of coefficients for highest exponent as then coefficients of each polynomial have changes of signs and so or less by even number of positive roots it means that total number of positive roots in both polynomials is even then the number of saddles is equal to the number of peripheral centers note that the points j 0 n 1 with the largest root is a center the union of centroids corresponding to these centers composes n flower ring for one of polynomial looses one change of sign in the sequence of coefficients then the number of positive roots of this polynomial becomes odd so total number of positive roots in both polynomials is odd then the number of saddles is more by 1 than the number of peripheral centers note that in this case the points j 0 n 1 with the largest root are saddles see figure 3 2 proof of proposition 8 lemma 1 system 2 4 in equators of poincare sphere i e in coordinates and is equivalent to system 2 3 in coordinates proof of these statement follows from formulas 23 thus and according to this lemma we consider system 2 3 in coordinates changing independent variable we get the system a 4 the equator of poincare sphere is defined by for odd system a 4 can be written as a 5 where are polynomials such that thus equilibria in the equator are where satisfy to the equation i e notice that for two neighboring jacobian of the considering system then thus one of these points is a stable node and another is unstable node the first statement is proven if is even then system a 4 in the poincare sphere equators can be written in the form a 6 24 equilibrium values of in system a 17 if they exist satisfy to the equation this equation has real roots if 1 and has no roots if 1 it is easily to verify that in the second case the equator does not contain equilibria and in the first case equilibria are alternated stable and unstable nodes indeed statements are proven corollary both statements of the proposition are true also for hamiltonian systems 4 h thus propositions 4 and 6 are also proven 25 appendix 2 phase portraits of several models figure a 2 1 phase parameter portraits of hamiltonian model 1 for n
