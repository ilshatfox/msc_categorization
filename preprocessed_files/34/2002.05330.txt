nonchaotic models and predictability of the users volume dynamics on internet platforms victoria rayskin tufts university department of mathematics bromfield pearson hall 503 boston avenue medford ma 02155 usa victoria rayskin tufts edu february 14 2020 abstract internet platforms traffic defines important characteristics of plat forms such as price of services advertisements speed of operations the traffic is usually estimated with the help of the traditional time series models arima holt winters etc which are successful in short term extrapolations of sufficiently denoised signals we propose a dynamical system approach for the modeling of the underlying process the method allows to discuss the global qualitative properties of the dynamics phase portrait and long term tendencies the proposed models are nonchaotic the long term prediction is reliable and it explains the fundamental properties and trend of various types of digital platforms because of these properties we call the flow of these models the trending flow utilizing the new approach we construct the two sided platform models for the volume of users that can be applied to amazon com homes mil or wikipedia org we consider a generalization of the two sided platforms models to multi sided platforms if the equations are cooperative the flow is trend ing and it helps to understand the properties of the platforms and reliably predicts the long term behavior i am very grateful to professor m w hirsch for important information which helped to improve this paper research was sponsored by the army research office

modeled as system s parameters initial conditions 1 introduction internet platforms become one of the most popular objects for our daily ac tivities there are many examples of interactions through platforms health exchange platforms connect health insurance providers subscribers bidding platforms connect auction buyers sellers real estate platforms connect renters home owners the 1000 genomes platform connects multi disciplinary re searchers the first three of these are examples of two sided platforms and the last example is the example of multi sided platform 16 6 users traffic is one of the most important characteristics of platforms for example it helps the platform owners to price the platform s services to predict platform s crashes due to high traffic and to plan platform development it becomes increasingly important to model the dynamics of the platform s volume of users as discussed in 7 usually model s selection depends on complexity of the data which spans a wide range easily predictable time series can be for example series with some seasonality trend or their combination on the opposite end of this range are series generated by the process which transmit no information from the past to the future like white noise processes series in the mid range generated by some non linear process pose interesting modeling challenges it is important to quantify where on the complexity range a given time series falls the detailed discussion of the complexity of the data estimated with entropy and model s selection can be found in 7 most of the real life processes are non linear and can be even chaotic as argued in 2 non linear time series analysis is important and should be reflected in the model s selection we discuss the dynamical systems approach for the study of the volume of users interacting through digital platforms these models are generally non linear except for the example 3 they have sensitivity to initial conditions but they are not chaotic we adopt r devaney 5 definition of chaos the flow of the models discussed in this paper has such geometric properties that make their long term behavior predictable some of the models are monotone or even cooperative the discussion of monotone and cooperative systems and its comparison to chaotic dynamics can be found in 10 11 12 17 and in many references therein the monotonicity of the models helps to understand global properties of the flow even though not all of the systems discussed in this work are monotone in the domain of our interest they have only trivial period 1 periodic cycles which are not dense i e the systems are nonchaotic the long term prediction of these systems is reliable and shows the trend of the flow for this reason we call the flow of our models the trending flow our goal is to understand the platform specific rules that govern the platform dynamics we would like to understand the platforms trends and long term 2 tendencies the dynamical systems approach for platform analysis discussed in 14 and 15 makes it now possible to develop strategies for increasing platforms efficiency inn the long run furthermore in the study of multi sided platforms which becomes increas ingly important dynamical systems are very well suited for a high number of platform sides finally prediction of a platform s future behavior may be sensitive to noise external effects and platform s policies any regime shift may significantly ef fect a prediction detecting regime shifts and adapting prediction models accordingly is an important area of future work 7 the dynamical sys tems approach allows one to associate changes in the external world with the changes in the trajectories initial conditions also one can study regions of sta bility and other fundamental qualitative concepts less sensitive to the external effects behavior of non linear systems can be chaotic and the long term prediction of trajectories often is not reliable for this reason we propose to fit the data into the models which have trending flow defined in section 2 this allows us to perform qualitative analysis of the processes and to understand the tendency of the processes see sections 4 and 5 moreover we can switch between differ ent trajectories of the dynamical system to reflect the changes in the external conditions we can also associate these switches with various incentives that help to influence platform s efficiency in section 3 we discuss a method for deriving the vector field of the specified form which fits the time series data of the process in section 4 we provide examples of the reconstructed dynamical systems and perform qualitative analysis of the phase portraits in section 5 we discuss specific internet platform models and the characteris tics of the mechanism that governs the dynamics of these models in particular we compare the properties of the seller buyer type of platforms and plat forms like wikipedia we note that the competition between sellers as well as competition between buyers restricts growth of the number of users of a seller buyer type of platform while wikipedia s popularity can grow if there are no wars between contributors such analysis of the global properties of the platforms is possible because of the nonchaotic trending nature of the models phase portraits 2 dynamics with trending flow many laws of nature and human activities can be modeled with the help of differential equations frequently as illustrated with the next example it is easier to observe and discover these equations than their solutions when studying the physical systems meteorological dynamics or chemical reactions that can be described with the help of the lorentz equations we face the complexity of chaotic behavior the differential equations of this process are 3 rather simple quadratic and easily discoverable with the modern techniques x 1 10 x 2 x 1 x 2 x 1 28 x 3 x 2 x 3 x 1 x 3 8 3 x 3 1 however if we try to describe the lorentz attractor trajectory corresponding to the solution of these equations we would not be able to write an explicit equation and would not be able to achieve high accuracy with approximations many processes for which the state variables equations cannot be explicitly written due to their complexity can be approximated with simple differential equations which have very few non linear terms our goal is to study the complex processes with the help of differential equations that can be fitted into the data generated by the processes this approach allows to understand the general laws governing the process to perform qualitative analysis of the system s global phase portrait and also depending on the external state to choose one of the initial value s trajectory for the short term prediction of the process the term chaos is not always understood in the same sense we will adopt the definition of r devaney 5 which requires as one of the conditions of chaos density of periodic points in that sense many systems with small non linearity are chaotic such as system 1 but the non linear models that we study in this paper are nonchaotic they only have stationary points which are not dense in the state space more over some of these dynamical systems are monotone the behavior of the monotone systems has been studied in multiple articles in many cases it can be proved that their typical trajectories tend towards fixed points or periodic orbits making the long term prediction more reliable for the overview and comparison of chaotic and monotone dynamics see 10 and for greater details see 11 12 17 and many references therein the models discussed in this paper are not necessarily monotone but they have very simple geometry definition 1 assume that we are interested in the dynamics on the set d which is the closer of an open set consider a system of differential equations defined on the domain d possibly well defined only on the interior side of the boundary we will say that the system of differential equations has trending flow on d if its semiflow t 0 with any initial value in d either converges to a fixed point in d or escapes the domain d in finite time through this paper the domain of interest is d 0 1 n rn the non linear dynamical system models discussed in this paper have trending flow on the d the study of the phase portrait of this flow can help to understand the long term forecast and trends of the processes the forecast is reliable because the flow is not chaotic on d 4 3 techniques of reconstruction of the vector field from the data how to reconstruct dynamical systems from data we will follow the ideas of the sindy method developed by brunton proctor kutz 3 however instead of trying to reconstruct one single trajectory we will assume that the data comes from many different trajectories because the process is influenced by external effects and consequently jumps from one initial value solution to another one we will try to reconstruct the vector field for some region of these trajectories accordingly we will use lasso ridge regression or a similar sparse re gression for the vector field approximation using the data points x tj here tj 1 p are the moments of times when the state variables x tj were recorded we will approximate the vector field x tj x tj x tj 1 tj tj 1 by a linear combination of functions from the library l x lk x tj k p k j 1 here k is the number of functions included in the library l more specifically for an n dimensional system we want to find the optimal values a a ki k n k i 1 s th l x a approximates x t x i tj x i tj k lk x tj a ki the library l of candidate functions may consist of homogeneous mono mials trigonometric and or other simple functions the matrix a is sparse because we need only a few terms for the vector field approximation 4 examples of the vector field reconstruction in this section we consider several examples of differential equations recon structed precisely or approximately from data using the method discussed in section 3 these examples are related to the dynamics of the volume of users on internet platforms which we will present in section 5 our first example will be based on the data simulated by the monotone system of differential equations x x y y y x 2 for the library l we will use monomials of order 5 and x y the lasso regression is capable of reconstructing the equations 2 precisely the reconstructed dynamical system can be analyzed the global properties can be described and the short term predictions can be performed starting at appro priate initial condition the phase portrait of this system which has 1 basin of 5 figure 1 true and identified trajectories defined by the equations 2 all trajectories in the basin of attraction 0 1 2 0 converge to 1 1 the flow is trending the trajectories initial conditions are shown as green squares the figure is reproduced with permission from amitans conference proceedings attraction with the attracting fixed point 1 1 is shown in figure 1 the phase portrait analysis provides a reliable information for the long term prediction because the system has trending flow next we will simulate the data with the help of another monotone system which is linear x x y y y x 3 theoretically this system is very simple however it has the whole diagonal of stationary points this singularity may cause problems with the traditional techniques for predicting future values of the process utilizing the dynamical systems approach we can try to reconstruct the differential equations from the simulated data using the same library l as in the example 2 then we can recover the equations precisely and obtain the simple picture of the linear flow figure 2 and again this analysis provides a reliable information for the long term prediction because this system has trending flow moreover because we discovered that the process is linear it is very easy to analyze this flow and to predict the future of the process in practice the functions which we include in the library l do not coincide with the functions or other mechanisms that generate the real process in the next example we will simulate the data with the help of the system which consists of the functions not included in our library x x y 1 4 sin 4 y y y x 1 4 sin 4 x 4 we will use the library of monomials of order 5 sin nx and cos nx n 1 13 6 figure 2 true and identified trajectories defined by the equations 3 all trajectories converge to the fixed points on the diagonal y x the flow is trending the trajectories initial conditions are shown as green squares the figure is reproduced with permission from amitans conference proceedings the result of the lasso regression is the system of the differential equations x 2669 x 5 2845 y 5 3128 sin 3 x 2479 sin 3 y 3808 cos 3 x 2753 cos 3 y 0977 cos 5 x y 2669 y 5 6149 sin 3 x 3128 sin 3 y 7437 cos 3 x 3808 cos 3 y 9624 cos 5 x 0977 cos 5 y 5 even though the identified equations 5 differ from the true equations 4 it appears that the approximation of the trajectories is of high precision figure 3 in this example the true trajectories are generated by the monotone system because sin sin 1 but we do not check monotonicity of the identi fied equations their phase portraits are similar the phase portraits of such systems are described by the theorem 2 because the geometry of the phase portraits is simple the long term tendency of the trajectories can be reliably estimated with the help of the phase portrait 5 dynamics of the volume of users on internet platforms in this section we will use the ideas of the differential equations approximation discussed in the sections 2 3 4 for the analysis of the traffic on internet 7 figure 3 trajectories of the true equations 4 and trajectories of the approxi mation of these equations with the system 5 there are 3 basins of attraction with the attracting stationary points 0 0 5 5 and 1 1 the flow is trend ing the trajectories initial conditions are shown as green squares the figure is reproduced with permission from amitans conference proceedings platforms the estimates of the volume of platform users are important for the platform owners helping them to price the platforms services to predict the moments of high traffic which occasionally cause platform s crashes and to understand the long term future of platforms popularity we will focus on the examples of the dynamical system models for the two types of internet platforms those that involve interaction similar to the seller buyer relations and those that are similar to the wikipedia platform we will analyze tendency and global properties of the volume of users interacting through these platforms with the help of the models having trending flow for more detailed analysis and proof of the results stated in this section see 14 and 15 first we discuss the two sided platforms they are characterized by two different types of users renters and home owners on homes mil sellers and buyers on amazon com readers and contributors on wikipedia org males and females on match com job seekers and employers on jobs com etc the volume of users in our model is a fraction of all theoretically possible users on each side of the platform we will denote them b and g for example b may represent the fraction of all possible buyers and g may represent the fraction of all possible sellers interacting through the amazon com platform and consider the following system b v g r b g w b s g b 0 1 g 0 1 here r b s g are the same side network effects and v g w b are the cross side network effects 8 the same side network effect represents the interaction within the same type of users this effect can be positive s 0 1 0 negative s 0 1 0 or non existent s 0 the same for the r function the negative effect is typical for renters and buyers who want to keep costs low for home owners on homes mil sellers on amazon com job seekers on jobs com males or females on match com who prefer lower competition positive effect occurs between reviewers on yelp or gamers who share access tools on gaming platforms on a platform like wikipedia the same side network effect does not exist unless there are some edit wars between contributors in subsection 5 1 we consider platforms with the negative same side network effect such as homes mil amazon com match com jobs com platforms with the negative same side network effect we call seller buyer type of platform then in subsection 5 2 we discuss the wikipedia platform in all examples discussed below we approximate the same side network ef fects with linear functions the cross side network effect represents users preferences and interest in the other type of users we believe that it reflects important differences between various platforms usually this effect is non negative therefore in this paper we assume v 0 and w 0 also nobody wants to join a platform without presence of the opposite party this implies the assumption w 0 v 0 0 time and range re scaling allow us to assume that w v 0 1 0 1 we will call w and v the attachment functions 5 1 systems with negative same side network effect in this subsection we discuss the users traffic model for platforms with the negative same side network effect approximated by linear functions b and g b v g b g w b g 6 where b 0 1 g 0 1 1 and v w 0 1 0 1 v 0 w 0 0 it is easy to see that each trajectory defined by the equations 6 with its initial condition in the unit square 0 1 2 remains in the square and converges to a fixed point due to negative divergence there are no periodic orbits in other words the model is well defined platform s population does not grow beyond 100 the flow is trending we will discuss the tendency convergence to the fixed points of the trajectories and other qualitative properties of the phase portrait of the system with various attachment functions v and w the first example is the power attachment i e v g g w b b 1 7 because fixed points of the dynamical system 6 are located at the inter sections of v and w we draw them on the same graph figure 4 the phase 9 figure 4 the power attachment functions the fixed points of the trending flow defined by the equations 6 with the attachments expressed by the equa tions 7 are located at the intersections of the attachment functions at the origin and at the corner 1 1 this strong attachment attracts all theoretically possible users eventually everybody joins the platform see figure 1 of sec tion 4 the figure is reproduced with permission from amitans conference proceedings portrait is shown in the figure 1 of section 4 it has one attracting fixed point at 1 1 the quadrant 0 1 2 0 is the basin of attraction this dynamics is monotone and moreover it has only simple fixed point attractor the traffic on the corresponding platforms can be predicted relatively easy we can conclude that with the power very strong cross side attachment all population tends to join the platform eventually many platforms can be characterized by step function attachments here for simplicity we show only 3 steps v g 0 g 0 25 1 2 g 25 75 1 g 75 1 w b 0 b 0 25 1 2 b 25 75 1 b 75 1 this dynamics is monotone the attractors are simple fixed points the flow is trending and the traffic of the corresponding platforms can be reliably pre dicted however the attachment functions are discontinuous for the real life applications it is natural to assume that these steps are smoothly connected possibly via rapidly growing functions called here c 1 and c 2 thus we will consider smoothed step function attachments shown in figure 5 10 figure 5 smoothed step attachment with 3 steps creates 3 attracting fixed points in the phase portrait of the dynamical system they are located in the 1 st 3 rd and 5 th points of intercept of the attachments the other 2 points of intercept are the hyperbolic fixed points of the dynamical system the figure is reproduced with permission from amitans conference proceedings v g 0 g 0 25 c 1 g g 25 25 1 2 g 25 75 c 2 g g 75 75 1 g 75 1 8 a similar equation can be written for w b the phase portrait corresponding to the smoothed step attachment with 3 steps is illustrated by the figure 3 of the section 4 it has 3 basins of attraction containing stable fixed points the basins are separated by separatrix passing through the 2 saddle fixed points see figure 6 because we used the equa tions with the smoothed step attachment functions for the approximation of the equations with the step function attachment it is natural to assume that v and w are non decreasing functions this makes the dynamics cooperative and easily predictable the class of cooperative systems see 12 has a variety of applications in biology chemistry physics and economics however even with out monotonicity assumption due to the negative same side network effect our model generates easily predictable behavior of the trajectories if we consider a more general case of non monotone attachments v and w theorem 2 implies that the flow of such system is trending conclusion 1 the model defined by the equations 6 with attachments ex pressed by the equations 8 has the trending flow shown in figure 6 it has the following properties if the volume of users is low within the low left basin all existing users tend to leave the platform eventually if the volume of users is in the middle basin of attraction the tendency of the volume is the middle fixed point 11 figure 6 fixed points are denoted by blue dots initial values of trajectories are green orange separatrix passing through saddle fixed points separate 3 basins of attraction low volume of users in the low left basin eventually extinct if the volume of users is in the middle basin of attraction the tendency of the volume is to the middle fixed point if the level of users is in the upper right basin of attraction the platform will eventually attract all population these global characteristics are reliable because the flow is trending if the level of users is high in the upper right basin the platform will eventually attract all population the long term prediction of the flow is reliable because the flow is trending the jumps between the basins of attraction happen with the help of external effects for example the platform owner can offer some incentives or change the platform s policy to jump from the lower basin to the higher one the general dynamics defined by the equations 6 can be described by the following theorem theorem 2 suppose the two sided platform model described by the equa tions 6 is smooth and has finite number of fixed points located at b g 0 1 2 b v g g w b then the fixed points are stable nodes saddles saddle nodes and stable spirals no repelling fixed points i e at least one eigenvalue has negative real part b 0 g 0 is a stable node spiral if and only if v g 0 w b 0 b 0 g 0 is a saddle if and only if v g 0 w b 0 b 0 g 0 belongs to center manifold if and only if v g 0 w b 0 moreover if v g 0 w b 0 1 v g 0 2 w b 0 6 0 then one of the 12 branches of center manifold converges to b 0 g 0 but the other one diverges from this fixed point the proof of this result can be found in 15 this theorem shows that the phase portrait s analysis of the models de scribed by the equations 6 helps to approximate the long term behavior of the trajectories the trajectories of the equations 6 like trajectories of mono tone systems are nonchaotic they have simple attractors fixed points and their long term prediction is reliable multi sided platforms are gaining popularity and become an important re search subject we will model them with the multi dimensional differential equations the multi sided platforms with the negative same side network ef fect can be described by the following system b 1 v 1 b 2 b 3 bn 1 b 1 b 2 v 2 b 1 b 3 bn 2 b 2 b n 1 vn 1 b 1 b 2 bn 2 bn n 1 bn 1 b n vn b 1 bn 1 nbn 9 where bk 0 1 k 1 and vk 0 1 0 1 vk 0 0 0 for k 1 n let us also assume that there is a finite number of stationary points in this system some of the properties of this system are similar to the properties of equa tions 6 for example the flow does not leave the n dimensional unit cube it is easy to see that at each fixed point the sum of the eigenvalues of the lin earized system is n k 1 k 0 i e at least one eigenvalue is negative if we assume that attachment functions of the equations 9 approximate some discrete step function attachments i e vi are non decreasing the system is cooperative and its long term prognoses is reliable however in the general case absence of closed orbits in multidimensional cases cannot be proved with the same technique as for the equations 6 the behavior of the trajectories can be complex and their long term prediction may be unreliable for the modeling of multidimensional processes the following question is important question 3 are there conditions on the attachment functions vk that make the flow of the equations 9 trending but not necessarily monotone 5 2 systems without the same side network effect the model for platforms without the same side network effect can be written as the following system of equations b v g g w b 10 13 figure 7 if we assume that negative same side network effect is not present the volume of platform users does not decline unless it jumps to a lower trajectory due to policy changes for example however if the origin was the only fixed point as shown here the flow of users would escape the unit square the figure is reproduced with permission from amitans conference proceedings where v w 0 1 0 1 and v 0 w 0 0 if we assume that v andw are differentiable and because v g b g w b g b 0 when b 6 0 g 6 0 we can see that the system is cooperative also without the differentiability assumption we can show that the flow is trending indeed since the attachment functions by definition are non negative the number of users never declines on such platforms also because b and g never decrease there are no cycles applying these ideas to the general tendency of the popularity of wikipedia we can conclude that in the long run it should increase if there is no the same side competition the trajectories of the equations 10 satisfy v g dg w b db 0 11 if v and w vanish not only at the origin then non zero stationary points are formed and the flow of users converges to such point s from left and below while staying within the point s basins of attraction or the flow escapes the unit square thus this flow is trending if 0 is the only stationary point or the volume of users is either above the highest stationary point or to the right of the rightmost stationary point the trajectories would eventually escape the unit square 0 1 2 as shown in figure 7 thus we assume that either the negative interaction between the users of the same side must appear at some point and the model changes or there are some non zero stationary points with both b and g positive coordinates and the initial volume of user is below and to the left of some stationary point the authors of 13 8 1 9 discuss issues like wikipedia s edit wars between contributors and newcomer retention they also discuss some new 14 policies re interpretations of the community rules and curating according to seniority this indicates some competition between contributors and possibly appearance of the negative same side network effect in this case the system becomes similar to the seller buyer system discussed in the section 5 1 then incentives provided to the contributors or some new policy can move the dy namics into a higher basin of attraction as discussed in conclusion 1 and increase the volume of contributors and readers the recent analysis of 9 shows that the number of wikipedia contributors declines if the edit wars are not fundamental characteristics of the wikipedia platform they can be viewed as a temporary external effects in this case the decline of the volume of users can possibly be explained as jumps from the higher trajectories to lower trajectory while the fundamental law governing the dynamics has no negative same side network effects and can be modeled with the equations 10 then the long term tendency of the trajectories is the growth of the number of users let us assume that the equations 10 describe the dynamics of the users volume of wikipedia as we noticed in this case v and w must vanish not only at the origin i e at some points gi bj 0 1 2 each side becomes indifferent to the opposite side v gi 0 and w bj 0 then gi bj are non zero stationary points since v g 0 on its domain gi must be a point of local minimum of v g and consequently v gi 0 similarly w bj 0 this implies that all non zero stationary points gi bj belong to the center manifolds which direct the flow north east as shown in figure 8 some of the trajectories may be trapped between the center manifolds and converge to the stationary points while other trajectories escape the unit square in the latter case we assume that it takes very long time to escape the unit square during a reasonably long time the volume of users does not grow beyond 100 the equations 10 can be generalized for multi sided platforms without same side network effect b 1 v 1 b 2 b 3 bn b 2 v 2 b 1 b 3 bn b n 1 vn 1 b 1 b 2 bn 2 bn b n vn b 1 bn 1 12 where bk 0 1 and vk 0 1 0 1 vk 0 0 for k 1 n because the attachment functions are non negative there are no cycles and the flow of users is always growing conclusion 2 the platforms modeled with the help of equations 12 in par ticular equations 10 have trending flow with the following properties 15 figure 8 if the attachment function v g has three zeros at 0 g 1 and g 2 and the attachment function w b has 3 zeros at 0 b 1 and b 2 the system has 9 sta tionary points shown in red color the flow of users with some positive volume of users on each side increases approaching one of the 4 non zero stationary points staying within some basin of attraction shown in green or escapes the unit square if the flow was above either b 2 or g 2 shown with dashed lines it would escape the unit square this flow is trending on a bounded domain in the long run the volume of users does not decrease the long term prediction is reliable a temporary decline of the volume of users may be due to external effects this corresponds to the jumps from the higher trajectories to the lower trajectories of the governing equations references 1 i beschastnikh t kriplean d w mcdonald wikipedian self governance in action motivating the
