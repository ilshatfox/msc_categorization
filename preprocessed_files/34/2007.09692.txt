tauchnitz hszg de 21 juli 2020 abstract this paper concerns a class of infinite horizon optimal control problems with state constraints by extending the needle variation method to the infinite horizon case we obtain a complete set of necessary optimality conditions for a strong local minimizer in form of the pontryagin maximum principle and the validity of several transversality conditions at infinity to this purpose we develop an approach in the space of continuous functions converging at infinity the considerations including new results on optimality and transversality conditions on banach spaces of continuous functions on the needle variation method and on problems with state constraints on the unbounded time horizon keywords pontryagin maximum principle optimal control infinite horizon opti mality conditions transversality conditions state constraints 1 introduction infinite horizon optimal control is a particular class in control theory the origin of this class goes back to the work of ramsey 21 in 1928 where the optimization of economic growth is considered as a variational problem on an unbounded planning horizon with the discovery of the pontryagin ma ximum principle for standard optimal control problems by pontryagin et al 20 in 1958 the impetus for the derivation of necessary conditions in the infinite horizon case was initiated in the recent years new results were established by different approaches like the finite horizon approximation the needle variation technique the approach by extremal principles the discrete time framework or the dynamic programming cf 1 7 9 16 19 and the references therein in this paper we present the pontryagin maximum principle for infinite horizon optimal control pro blems with state constraints the proof bases on the procedure in ioffe tichomirov 15 for regularly locally convex problems but this method must be extended to the infinite horizon case we achie ve necessary conditions in form of the adjoint equation the maximum condition and standard type transversality conditions our framework is closely related to the paper of brodskii 8 but in con trast to 8 we consider strong local optimality and we use the state space of continuous functions converging at infinity the last fact delivers the complete information on the subdifferential of state constraints on the infinite horizon consequently we obtain a more aesthetic representation of the 1 http arxiv org abs 2007 09692 v 1 adjoint as in 8 moreover we investigate objectives with general summable functions like a determi nistic unbounded weibull distribution the paper is organized as follows we start with the statement of the control problem the main as sumptions and the maximum principle section 2 in section 3 we present the proof of the maximum principle the proof is divided into different parts the introduction of the spaces of continuous func tions converging at infinity the statement and properties of the extremal problem results on needle variations and linear differential equations in the infinite horizon case the convex analysis of state constraints on the infinite horizon and finally the completion of the proof by standard arguments section 4 is devoted to transversality conditions and to the normal form of the maximum principle in the absence of state constraints then we show arrow type sufficiency conditions in section 5 we conclude the paper with section 6 where we show the relation between finite horizon and infinite horizon optimal control problems 2 problem formulation and the maximum principle we consider the following infinite horizon optimal control problem j x u 0 t f t x t u t dt inf 2 1 x t t x t u t 2 2 h 0 x 0 0 lim t h 1 t x t 0 2 3 u t u rm u 6 2 4 gj t x t 0 t r j 1 l 2 5 throughout

variables and uniformly continuously differentiable w r t x on v u 1 definition 2 2 the set alip denotes the set of all pairs x u w 1 r rn l r u with x xlip according to the special character of infinite horizon optimal control problems with bounded processes we state the following restrictive properties let x u w 1 r rn l r u and 0 t x t u t dt 0 x t x t u t dt 2 6 2 furthermore we assume that for any 0 there exists a t 0 such that the relation t t t u t t t u t x t x t u t t t dt 2 7 holds for all w 1 r rn with x x definition 2 3 the set alim denotes the set of all pairs x u w 1 r rn

strong local minimizer iff there exists a number 0 such that the inequality j x u j x u holds for any x u aadm for which x x definition 2 6 a the borel algebra on r consists of all sets b a e with open subsets a of r and e b by m r we denote the set of the borel measures on r which have a unique representation 0 where 0 is a regular signed borel measure on r cf 22 and is a finite signed measure concentrated at t we introduce the pontryagin function h r rn rm rn r r h t x u p 0 0 t f t x u p t x u theorem 2 7 let x u aadm alip alim if x u is a strong local minimizer in the problem 2 1 2 5

variation and continuous from the left in the case the measures j containing non zero masses concentrated at infinity it follows lim t p t lim t ht 1 x t x t l 1 l j 1 gjx t x t j 2 11 the requirement x u alim is a major restriction for the application of theorem 2 7 we demonstrate this fact in the following example 3 example 2 8 we consider the problem j x z u 0 e t 1 u t x t dt sup s t x t u t x t x 0 1 u 0 1 0 1 z t e tx t z 0 0 z t z t r z 1 the latter differential equation and the state constraint are the result of the budget constraint 0 e tx t dt z since z t 0 on r and z t z it follows e

theorem 2 7 are violated in the absence of state constraints theorem 2 7 leads to the following version of the maximum principle 4 theorem 2 9 let x u aadm alip alim if x u is a strong local minimizer in the problem 2 1 2 4 then there exist a number 0 0 vectors l 0 rs 0 l 1 rs 1 and a vector valued function p r rn not all zero such that a the vector valued function p satisfies almost everywhere on

the admissible process x z u again applying the ne cessary conditions of theorem 2 9 we obtain 0 1 p t e t q t 1 herein the adjoint q does not vanish at infinity 3 the proof of the pontryagin maximum principle 3 1 the extremal principle for locally convex problems let x and y be banach spaces let u be an arbitrary set let j be a functional on x u let f 1 fl be functionals on x and let f x u y be a mapping of the product x u into y we consider an extremal problem of the abstract form j x u inf f x u 0 f 1 x 0 fl x 0 x x u u 3 1 an admissible pair x u x u in problem 3 1 satisfies f x u 0 f 1 x 0 fl x 0 and making the functional j finite the admissible pair x u is a strong local minimizer iff there exists a number 0 such that the inequality j x u j x u holds for any admissible pair x u for which x x x for the extremal problem 3 1 we define the lagrange function l x u r y rl r l x u 0 y 1 l 0 j x u y f x u l j 1 jfj x moreover denotes the set 1 d rd 1 d 0 d i 1 i 5 theorem 3 1 let x u be an admissible element in the problem 3 1 assume that the point x has a neighborhood v such that a 1 the operator fx x u x y is linear and continuous a 2 the function x j x u is continuous on the neighborhood v and fre chet differentiable at x for any u u a 3 the functions f 1 x fl x are continuous on the neighborhood v and regularly locally convex at x b for every finite set of points u 1 ud u and every 0 there exist a neighborhood v v x v a number 0 and a mapping u u which have the following properties b 1 u 0 u b 2 the following inequalities hold for any x x v and any f x u f x u fx x u x x d k 1 k k f x uk f x u y x x x d k 1 k k j x u j x u d k 1 k j x uk j x u x x x d k 1 k finally we assume that c the range of the linear operator x fx x u x has a finite codimension in y if x u is a strong local minimizer in the problem 3 1 then there exist non trivial lagrange multipliers 0 0 1 0 l 0 and y y with 0 xl x u 0 y 1 l 0 jx x u f x x u y l j 1 j xfj x 3 2 l x u 0 y 1 l min u u l x u

1 the functional x j x u assumed to be fre chet differentiable at x which is a stronger requirement than the regularly locally convexity in 15 2 in 15 the mapping in assumption b has the more abstract form u x v u remark 3 3 since the first inequality in the assumption b 2 states the required differentiability of the mapping f we replaced the assumption a in 15 e g the mapping x f x u is of class c 1 at the point x for any u u by the assumption a 1 the type of differentiability in b 2 satisfies the requirements of the implicit function theorem in form of the generalized lyusternik theorem in 15 6 3 2 the space of continuous functions converging at infinity in the following we develop a framework for the state space x in the abstract extremal problem 3 1 the need of a suitable state space arises by different challenges on the infinite horizon 1 according to 2 3 e g lim t h 1 t x t 0 the trajectory x may posses a limit at infinity 2 let c 0 r r be the space of continuous functions vanishing at infinity then x c 0 r r satisfies the state constraint x t 0 on r iff x k z c 0 r r z t 0 for all t r but k possesses an empty interior let z k with z t 0 on r and consider the sequence zn t z t t 6 2 n 1 2 n 1 z t 2 z 2 n t 2 n 1 2 n 1 t t 2 n 1 2 n 1 then zn z 0 as n and zn 6 k for all n hence in the space c 0 r r the interior of k and the origin cannot be separated by the hahn banach separation theorem for convex sets 3 in the space c 0 r r the subdifferential of f x sup t r x t max t r x t delivers in x 0 the set of all non negative regular borel measures on r with the non strict attribute 1 indeed for any function z c 0 r r with z t 0 on r the definition f z x f 0 f z x z leads to 0 sup t r z t 0 z t d t 0 to fix these lacks we consider the space clim r r n of continuous vector functions converging at infinity which can be defined equivalently in the following ways clim r r n x c r rn lim t x t a rn x r rn x t x 0 t a x 0 c 0 r rn a rn the first setting delivers the natural norm x x but the representation in the second setting implies the norm x x 0 a lemma 3 4 on x clim r r n the norms x x x and x x x 0 a are equivalent proof by definition any x clim r rn possesses the unique representation x x 0 a with x 0 c 0 r rn and a rn since x t a as t the inequality x a holds let x 0 a then we obtain immediately x x 2 x in the case a x 0 there exists 0 1 with a x 0 it follows x x 0 a max x 0 a a min 0 1 max 1 x 0 1 2 x 0 consequently the inequalities x x x 3 x hold on clim r rn in the following we make use of the notation x lim t x t instead of the vector a rn 7 lemma 3 5 riesz s representation theorem any continuous linear functional x on clim r r n can be uniquely represented in the form x x 0 x t x d t tx 0 x 0 t d t tx where 1 n is a vector of regular signed borel measures on r cf 22 and rn or equivalently in the form x x 0 x t d t where 1 n is a vector of signed borel measures 1 n m r cf definition 2 6 proof any x clim r rn has the unique representation x x 0 a with x 0 c 0 r rn and a rn consider the linear mapping with x x 0 which maps the space clim r rn onto c 0 r r n then is continuous x 0 3 x by lemma 3 4 and ker x clim r rn x t a on r let x c lim r rn we denote by i the value of the functional x at the vector valued function whose i th component is identical 1 and whose remaining components are identically zero now we consider the functional x 1 c lim r rn defined by the formula x 1 x x x t a x t x 0 t a 1 n obviously x 1 ker by the lemma of the annihilator cf 15 there exists a functional x 0 x 0 with x 1 x 0 that means the equation x 1 x x 0 x x 0 x x 0 x 0 holds for all x clim r rn consequently for x c lim r rn we obtain the representation x x x 0 x 0 t a 0 x 0 t d t tx in this equation we set 0 d t and define the borel measure then the last representation formula in lemma 3 5 is shown finally the uniqueness of this representation can be verified directly in the space clim r r n we conclude 1 the space clim r r n is a suitable framework for restrictions of the form lim t h 1 t x t 0 2 the interior of the cone k z clim r r z t 0 for all t r is non empty and containing any x clim r r with max t r x t 0 3 we consider f x max t r x t by definition of f 0 we obtain in the space clim r r the inequalities max t r x t 0 x t d t max t r x t min t r x t this shows that the subdifferential of f consists in x 0 of those and only those non negative borel measures m r which satisfy 1 8 3 3 the abstract optimization problem and properties let x u alip alim and x clim r rn on clim r rn l r u we consider the mappings j x u 0 t f t x t u t dt f x u t x t x 0 t 0 s x s u s ds t 0 h 0 x h 0 x 0 h 1 x lim t h 1 t x t gj x t gj t x t t r fj x max t r gj t x t j 1 l moreover on clim r r n we define the linear operators jx x u 0 t fx t x t u t t dt fx x u t t 0 t 0 x s x s u s s ds t 0 h 0 x h 0 x 0 0 h 1 x lim t h 1 x t x t t g j x x t gjx t x t x t t r j 1 l furthermore let x clim r r n and let u be the set u u l r u u t u t m t w t u t w l r u m r measurable and bounded 3 5 we introduce the mappings f f h 0 h 1 fx x u fx h 0 h 1 x u then the optimal control problem 2 1 2 5 becomes the form 3 1 j x u inf f x u 0 f 1 x 0 fl x 0 x x u u 3 6 lemma 3 6 for any u u the mapping x j x u is fre chet differentiable at the point x and jx x u is the fre chet derivative proof according to x xlip for a fixed u l r u the mappings t f t x t u t and t fx t x t u t are uniformly bounded by c 0 0 a e on r for all x clim r rn with x x therefore the functional j x u is finite moreover the mapping x jx x u x is linear and continuous let 0 be given then we choose a number t 0 with t t 2 c 0 dt 2 moreover for sufficiently small 0 0 we have ess sup t 0 t x 1 fx t x t x u t fx t x t u t 2 1 l 1 0 0 9 it

all x clim r rn with x x furthermore the condition t 0 t x t u t dt holds consequently lim t f x u t exists for any pair x u clim r rn u lemma 3 8 the linear operator fx x u is continuous proof at first it is obvious that the mappings hi clim r r n rsi are continuously differentia ble on clim r r n and the linear operators h i x are their derivatives according to the second condition in 2 6 the linear operator fx x u is continuous lemma 3 9 for j 1 l the mappings gj are differentiable at the point x with fre chet derivative g j x proof according to the properties of gj t x the limits lim t

needle variations introducing needle variations in infinite horizon optimal control we have to take into account two challenging tasks the unbounded time interval and an unbounded density l 1 r r like a weibull type distribution t tk 1 e t k with form parameter k 0 1 in the following we develop a method where the needle variations are concentrated on a suitable compact subset of r for any measurable subset a the number a denotes the lebesgue measure of a let k r be a compact set with k 0 then there exists a number t 0 with k 0 t moreover for any n n there exist numbers 0 t 0 t 1 tn t with ti 1 ti k k n i 1 n therefore the sets i ti 1 ti k defining a sorted partition of k with equal length with these preliminary remarks we can state the following lemma which is a direct consequence of the results on intervals t 0 t 1 in 15 pp 243 246 lemma 3 10 let k be a compact subset of r and let yi yi k rni i 1 d be boun ded measurable vector valued functions then for every 0 there exist one parameter families m 1 md 0 1 d of measurable subsets of k such that mi k mi mi mi mi max t k 0 t k mi mi yi d 0 t k yi d for all i 1 d 0 1 d and i 6 i proof the proof in 15 bases on the explicit construction for step functions we repeat this construc tion in the case of the compact set k let y t m j 1 yj aj t be a step function where a 1 am is a partition of k furthermore let c max j yj then we can state a sorted partition 1 r of k with equal length no greater than 2 c we define the sets mij t aj i t 0 aj i d aj i then the sets m i j mij are the required sets it holds m i j mij i j aj i k

we have to verify that this problem has the properties indicated in the condition b of theorem 3 1 let x u aadm alip alim moreover let u 1 ud u and 0 be given then there exists a number t 0 such that the bounded sets mi in the representation of the elements ui are subsets of the interval 0 t in addition the number t can be choosen such that the condition 2 7 is satisfied with 3 e g t t x t u t t x

yi t are measurable and bounded with the corresponding sets m 1 k md k in lemma 3 10 we define on r the mapping u u where u t u t d i 1 mi i t ui t u t according to this expression we call the mapping u a generalized needle variation on the set qd qd 1 d rd 0 i 1 d i 1 d 12 the mapping u u is well defined by v and we denote the sets v x clim r rn x x 1 d rd 1 d 0 d i 1 i on v we consider the mappings 1 x t t 0 x u x u d t r 1 x t t 0 x x u x x d i 1 i x ui x u d t r and the functionals 2 x 0 t f t x t u t f t x t u t dt 2 x d i 1 0 i t f t x t ui t f t x t u t dt lemma 3 11 there exist 0

finally by 3 7 that last term does not exceed 3 x x the proof is completed lemma 3 12 there exist 0 and 0 1 d such that the inequality 2 x 2 x d i 1 i 3 12 holds for all x v and all proof the left

furthermore the number t 0 is chosen such that ui t u t for all t t and i 1 d this yields d i 1 t i t f t x t ui t f t x t u t dt 0 as in 15 pp 246 251 on the compact interval k we obtain d i 1 k mi i

related to the finite horizon case in 15 analogously to 15 t a t is a mapping of r into the space of linear operators from rn to rn and a t r rn is a vector valued function 14 lemma 3 13 assume that the mapping t a t and the vector valued function a t are summable on r then for every vector valued function z clim r rn and every 0 there exists a unique vector valued function x clim r rn such that x t z t t a s x s a s ds for all t 0 proof according to the assumptions on the mappings t a t t a t the operator q x qx t z t t a s x s a s ds maps the space clim r r n into itself then lemma 3 13 is

from the fixed point theorem of weissinger cf 14 corollary 3 14 the linear operator fx x u maps the space clim r r n onto itself lemma 3 15 let the mapping t a t and the vector valued function a t satisfy all conditions in lemma 3 13 then for every z rn and every 0 there exists a unique solution x t of 3 13 on 0 such that x z 3 6 convex analysis state constraints on the infinite horizon is a special and rarely considered topic at this point we would recall the discussion in section 3 2 for the present particular mappings we state the relation between the one sided directional derivative

differentiable at x 0 and let the proper convex function y r be continuous at g x 0 then the function f x g x is regular in x 0 e g f x 0 x f x 0 x for all x x now with the mappings gj defined in section 3 3 we consider the following functions on clim r r n fj x gj x max t r gj t x t j 1 l 15 lemma 3 17 the function clim r r r is proper convex and continuous moreover by lemma 3 9 the mappings gj clim r r n clim r r are fre chet differentiable at the point x xlip consequently the functions fj x gj x j 1 l are regularly locally convex in x cf 15 finally the standard arguments deliver the following representation cf 10 11 15 lemma 3 18 for any j 1 l the subdifferential of the function fj at the point x contains those and only those continuous linear functions x c lim r rn that can be represented in the form x x 0 gjx t x t x t d j t where j m r is non negative having norm 1 and supported on the set tj t r gj t x t fj x 3 7 completion of the proof the optimal control problem 2 1 2

completed 4 transversality conditions and the normal form in the absence of state constraints in the following we differ between special types of boundary conditions at infinity definition 4 1 we say 2 1 2 4 is a problem with 1 free endpoint iff lim t x t is free 2 fixed endpoint iff lim t x t x 1 with a fixed vector x 1 rn 3 mixed partly free and partly fixed endpoint iff lim t xi t is free for i 1 l and lim t xi t xi 1 with fixed numbers xi 1 for i l 1 n for convenience reasons lim t x t x 1 denotes the mixed endpoint according to the transversality conditions in theorem 2 9 we obtain immediately the following versions of they so called natural transversality conditions lemma 4 2 let p be the vector valued function stated in theorem 2 9 consider the problem 2 1 2 4 with a free endpoint then the following conditions hold lim t p t 0 lim t p t x t 0 for all x w 1 r rn b mixed endpoint then the following condition holds lim t p t x t x t 0 for all admissible x w 1 r rn 17 according to x u alim the condition 0 x t x t u t dt 4 1 is satisfied it follows by lemma 3 15 that the equation z t tx t x t u t z t lim t z t 0 possesses the unique solution z t 0 on r hence we can state lemma 4 3 in the problem 2 1 2 4 with free endpoint the normal form of the maximum principle holds e g theorem 2 9 is satisfied with 0 1 let y t z t be the fundamental matrix solutions normalized at t 0 of the homogeneous linear systems y t x t x t u t y t z t tx t x t u t z t we consider the function y t y t y t 1 with arbitrarily fixed t r and rn according to 4 1 the function y belongs to the space w 1 r rn furthermore in the problem 2 1 2 4 with free endpoint the following formula holds cf 1 p t z t z 1 t p t t t z s 1 s fx s x s u s ds t r consider p t y t using z 1 t y t

lemma 4 4 let p be the vector valued function stated in theorem 2 9 in the problem 2 1 2 4 with free endpoint the adjoint p possesses the representation p t z t t z s 1 s fx s x s u s ds 4 2 where z t is the fundamental matrix solution normalized at t 0 of the linear system z t tx t x t u t z t note that the representation formula 4 2 is the same as in 1 4 in contrast to the theory in 1 4 the lemma 4 4 characterizes strong local minimizer in the present infinite horizon optimal control problems now let the density function l 1 r r possesses a limit at infinity e g lim t t 0 then in the problem 2 1 2 4 with free endpoint the limits lim t t f t x t u t 0 lim t p t t x t u t 0 hold consequently the transversality condition of michel cf 17 is satisfied lemma 4 5 in the problem 2 1 2 4 with free

differentiable f 0 f 0 f 0 for an economical inter pretation cf 23 in contrast to 23 we replaced the condition lim inf t x t 0 by the state constraint x t 0 on r in this problem the optimality

be reduced to p 1 t u t cp 2 t f u t e rt f u t qu t max u 0 p 1 t u cp 2 t f u e rt f u qu let d r ac r then the representation of p 2 t leads to df u t e rt u t p 1 t qe rt max u 0 df u e rt u p 1 t

a df 0 q this case leads to g 0 0 and we obtain u t 0 x t x 0 y t y 0 cf 0 t p 1 t 0 p 2 t a r e rt b df 0 q and p 1 0 0 by g u df u q e rt 0 we obtain the optimal control u t u 0 0 on r in contradiction to x t 0 for all t r c df 0 q und p 1 0 0 since p 1 0 0 the resource will be completely extracted that means there exists t 0 with x t 0 for t 0 t and x t 0 for t t consequently u t 0 for t t for t t the adjoint p 1 is monotonically decreasing and satisfies p 1 t df 0 q e rt for t t p 1 t df 0 q e rt for t t according to p 1 0 0 it follows t we show the uniqueness of t 0 for 0 let the family u be defined by f u t 1 d q df 0 q er t t 0 and u t 0 for t since f u f 0 the functions u are continuous moreover the relation f u t f us t e g u t us t holds for all t 0 and all s therefore the function u 0 u t dt is strictly increasing with u 0 0 then the number t satisfies the condition u t x 0 22 in the cases a and c the adjoints p 1 p 2 satisfying piecewise the adjoint equation moreover the problem is linear in the state variables x y thus the hamiltonian h is a concave function of x y and g t x y x is convex in x y therefore in the cases a and c the sufficiency conditions of theorem 5 5 are satisfied 6 optimal control on finite and infinite horizon in infinite horizon optimal control there exist several definitions of optimality and a corresponding number of methods to proof necessary optimality conditions one of the most popular methods is the finite horizon approximation but the pathologies arising by this method are documented in literature cf 1 13 as an example we discuss the linearized ramsey model example 6 1 we consider the problem j x u 0 e t 1 u t x t dt sup x t u t x t x 0 x 0 u 0 1 0 1 for any t t ln 1 the process xt t et t 0 e t t ut t 1 t

in the problem on the infinite horizon motivated by the pathologies the question of the relation between finite horizon and infinite horizon optimal control problems arises one part of the answer can be given by the time transformation method let t 0 1 r be a bijective function with t 0 0 therefore the mapping t must satisfy the condition t 1 then the time transformation cf 15 leads to the states t s y s x t s and the controlw s u t s and the problem 2 1 2 5 possesses on 0 1 the form j y w 1 0 v s s f t s y s w s ds inf y s v s t s y s w s t s v s h 0 y 0 0 h 1 t 1 y 1 0 t 0 0 t 1 w s u v s 0 gj t s y s 0 s 0 1 j 1 l 23 this problem including the singularity t 1 which follows from the transformation of r onto the finite interval 0 1 or in other words the infinite horizon possesses the nature of a singularity therefore the infinite horizon optimal control problem 2 1 2 5 cannot be reduced to a classical one on the other hand consider the standard optimal control problem on the finite horizon t 0 t 1 r j x u t 1 t 0 f t x t u t dt inf 6 1 x t t x t u t 6 2 h 0 x 0 0 h 1 x t 1 0 6 3 u t u rm u 6 6 4 gj t x t 0 t t 0 t 1 j 1 l 6 5 in the problem 6 1 6 5 let all the conditions

restrictions 2 6 2 7 are satisfied moreover we define the functions g j t x gj t 0 x 1 e t t 0 2 t t 0 gj t x t t 0 t 1 gj t 1 x 1 e t t 1 2 t t 1 with the density function t t 0 t 1 t the problem 6 1

remark 6 2 in t t 0 and t t 1 the mappings f t x u t x u may are discontinuous but the method of proof presented in this paper is still applicable then the pair x u is a strong local minimizer in the problem 6 6 6 10 iff the pair x u with x t u t x t u t on t 0 t 1 is a strong local minimizer in the problem 6 1 6 5 in particular the sets tj t t 0 t 1 gj t x t 0 t j t r 0 g j t x t 0 24 coincide for any j 1 l furthermore the requirement x u alim is satisfied in the problem 6 6 6 10 applying the pontryagin maximum principle 2 9 in the problem 6 6 6 9 and taking into account that p t 0 for t 6 t 0 t 1 then there exist non trivial multipliers 0 0 vectors l 0 rs 0 l 1 rs 1 and a vector valued function p t 0 t 1 rn such that a the vector valued function p satisfies almost everywhere on t 0 t 1

7 conclusions in this paper we developed a novel approach to a class of infinite horizon optimal control problems the result is a complete set of necessary optimality conditions in form of the pontryagin maximum principle moreover we have shown the validity of several transversality conditions and arrow type sufficiency conditions in order to proof the maximum principle we introduced new elements in the needle variation method on an unbounded time interval and with an arbitrary summable density func tion in the field of convex analysis in the framework of continuous functions converging at infinity and for linear differential equations on the infinite horizon finally we have demonstrated that the standard control theory on the finite horizon is a particular case of infinite horizon optimal control problems with bounded processes this paper provides different perspectives the trajectories converging at infinity is a suitable frame work in problems with steady states and in problems with the turnpike phenomenon in particular the space of continuous functions converging at infinity may be useful in non smooth control problems on unbounded intervals furthermore the introduction of spaces of functions converging at infinity in section 3 2 can be directly extended to the cases of sequence spaces p lebesgue spaces lp r r n and sobolev spaces w 1 p r r n with 1 p the control problems with bounded processes play ing an essential role in recent articles on infinite horizon optimal control problems in the discrete time framework cf 5 7 and in the dynamic programming cf 6 9 the demonstrated degenerations in the convex analysis in the space of continuous functions vanishing at infinity carry over to the discrete time framework in the space of zero sequences an alternative will be the space of convergent sequences moreover the achieved results are a solid base to discuss the links between pontryagin s maximum principle and bellman s
