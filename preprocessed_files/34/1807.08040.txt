mathematics university of houston houston tx 77204 usa abstract motivated by recent outbreaks of the ebola virus we are concerned with the role that a vector reservoir plays in supporting the spatio temporal spread of a highly lethal disease through a host population in our context the reservoir is a species capable of harboring and sustaining the pathogen we develop models that describe the horizontal spread of the disease among the host population when the host population is in contact with the reservoir and when it is not in contact with the host population these models are of reaction diffusion type and they are analyzed and their long term asymptotic behavior is determined 2000 mathematics subject classification 34 35 k 65 92 b 99 keywords vector host reaction diffusion reservoir model asymptotic behavior 1 introduction in what follows we introduce a suite of models of increasing complexity to describe the role of a reservoir in circulating a highly lethal disease among a host population in our context the reservoir will be a species in which the infectious agent normally lives and multiplies we assume the reservoir harbors the infectious agent without injury to itself and is capable of transmitting the agent to the host species we model the outbreak and spatio temporal spread of a highly lethal disease that is initiated and sustained via contact of a host population with an infected reservoir population we will be able to account for the random dispersion of the host population across a region and the random dispersion of the reservoir species across a proper subregion of we will assume that the infectious agent is transferred to the host by virtue of contact with the infected reservoir and that the agent can be transferred horizontally within the host population via contact of infected and uninfected hosts circulation of the infectious agent within the reservoir population occurs horizontally by contact of the uninfected and the infected we assume no vertical transmission within either population our models do not feature standard crisscross dynamics 1 they do not allow transfer of the infectious agents from the infected host to the uninfected reservoir we 1 http arxiv org abs 1807 08040 v 1 are motivated by outbreaks of the ebola virus disease also known as ebola hemorrhagic fever which is commonly called ebola the first recorded outbreak of ebola occurred 1976 and between this and the 2013 2015 west african outbreak 24 outbreaks have occurred 14 ebola affects humans primates fruit bats and other mammals the natural reservoir of the ebola virus is yet to be deter mined however among a range of accidental animal hosts fruit bats are believed to be the natural ebola virus reservoir 10 the virus exhibits a very high pathogenicity among hu mans nonhuman primates and other mammals however it does not appear to have much if any deleterious effect on fruit bats ebola symptoms include fever sore throat muscular pain headaches vomiting diarrhea rash decreased function of the liver and kidneys and bleeding internal and external the infectious phase starts between two days and three weeks after exposure the disease has a high mortality killing between 25 and 90 percent of those infected within humans the virus is spread by direct contact with bodily fluids blood urine saliva sweat feces vomit breast milk and semen the bodies of individuals who have died from the disease as well as those suffering from the disease can transmit the virus can also be transmitted by objects of clothing that have been contaminated with the bodily fluids of either individuals with the disease or the bodies of individuals who have succumbed to the disease 18 there is additionally a possibility that the virus persists in the semen of men who have recovered from the disease and that the disease can be prop agated via sexual congress however we shall not include this mechanism in our modeling considerations we feel it incumbent to emphasize that our models are prototypes far too simplistic to provide an accurate depiction of the spread of ebola and can only serve as a gateway to the study of more comprehensive and realistic models we shall use the terms host and reservoir populations and not refer to any specific host or reservoir species our concluding remarks will return the ebola virus as a topic of discussion 2 spatially homogeneous outbreak model in a re gion with no reservoir the first model describes an outbreak of the virus in a host population that is removed from the reservoir here we could consider the arrival of infected travelers in a virus free region with no indigenous reservoir from a region inhabited by an infected reservoir our model is a simple system of ordinary differential equations that does not include any spatial considerations we use a variant of the well known seir model to describe the propagation of the disease 2 the state variables are s e i and r together with the variable c the variables s e i and r represent the standard seir compartments the susceptible class s consists of individuals who are capable of contracting the disease the exposed class e consists of individuals who have contracted the diseases but who have not yet become fully infected and are not capable of transmitting it the infected class i consists of individuals who are fully infected by the virus and are capable of transmitting it and the removed class r consists of individuals who have perished those who have acquired immunity by recovery or those who have become immune by exposure without fully developing the disease the removed class does not affect the dynamics of the systems and there is no need to consider it analytically we include it in our discussion because in a natural way it tracks the impact of the disease the contaminated class c represents contaminated bodies of individuals who have died from the disease the progression of ebola can be described by the following system of ordinary differential equations and initial conditions ds dt is sc 2 1 a de dt is sc e 2 1 b di dt 1 e i 2 1 c dc dt 1 i c 2 1 d dr dt 2 e 2 i c 2 1 e s 0 s 0 e 0 e 0 i 0 i 0 c 0 c 0 r 0 r 0 2 1 f we assume the initial populations s 0 e 0 i 0 0 and c 0 r 0 0 and the parameters 1 2 1 2 0 with 1 2 and 1 2 the total population is given by p s e i susceptible individuals can contract the disease from contact with either infected individuals or with the contaminated the transmission rates are given by is and sc respectively entering the exposed class the virus incubates during the exposed stage and is noninfectious and essentially asymptomatic individuals leave the ex posed class with a constant rate 0 either becoming fully infected and infectious at rate 1 0 or they are able to subdue the virus and leave the exposed class for the removed class remaining non infectious and acquiring immunity at rate 2 0 infectious individ uals leave the infectious class at a constant rate 0 either perishing and entering the contaminated class or recovering those perishing enter the contaminated class at the rate 1 0 and those recovering gain permanent immunity entering the removed class at rate 2 0 contact between susceptibles and the contaminated will expose them to the virus and further deplete the susceptible class contamination decays at a constant rate 0 3 we formally state the following result and include its proof only in an effort to set the stage for what follows theorem 2 1 assume 1 2 1 2 0 with 1 2 and 1 2 if s 0 e 0 i 0 0 and c 0 r 0 0 there exists a unique uniformly bound nonnegative global solution s t e t i t c t r t to 2 1 a 2 1 f with max t 0 s t e t i t c t s 0 e 0 i 0 c 0 in addition lim t e t lim t i t lim t c t 0 and lim t s t s 0 proof the analysis of this system relies on elementary methods of ordinary differential equations a variety of different fixed point theorems guarantee the existence of unique so lutions on a maximal interval 0 tmax showing that the solution components are uniformly bounded on any bounded interval 0 tmax will insure that tmax we observe that the vector field f s e i c is sc is sc e 1 e i 1 i c 2 e 2 i c does not point out of the positive orthant of r 5 consequently since all the initial data is componentwise nonnegative the solutions to 2 1 a 2 1 f are nonnegative for t 0 tmax if we define u t s t e t i t c t r t then we can sum the equations in 2 1 a 2 1 e to observe du dt 0 and consequently u t u 0 as a result there exists an m 0 so that s t e t i t c t r t s 0 e 0 i 0 c 0 r 0 for all t 0 tmax hence tmax and we are assured unique uniformly bound nonnegative global solutions moreover there exists n 0 so that max ds dt de dt di dt ds dc n 4 we set w s e i c and observe that dw dt 2 e 2 i c 0 and hence 0 e s i s c s ds coupling this with the nonnegativity of e i and c and the boundedness of their derivatives implies lim t e t lim t i t lim t c t 0 now observe that if g s i s c s then 0 g s ds k also ds dt g t s consequently s t s 0 e t 0 g s ds s 0 e k 0 therefore since s t is nonincreasing and bounded below by s 0 e k 0 we area assumed that lim t s t s 0 3 reservoir supported spread in this section we consider the case of an infected reservoir introducing and supporting the spread of a virus through a host population in this case susceptible hosts can contract the disease via contact with an infected reservoir as well as horizontally from infected and con taminated hosts interspecies transmission occurs only from infected reservoir to susceptible hosts we do not assume that infected or contaminated hosts transmit the virus back to the reservoir our model accounts for disease dynamics and demographics within the reservoir we assume that the reservoir demographics are modeled by the standard logistic equation we let t denote the time dependent reservoir population having birth rate and logistic mortality coefficient m both and m are positive constants the reservoir population t satisfies d dt m 2 3 1 a 0 0 0 3 1 b the presence of the virus subdivides the reservoir population two compartments the un infected t and the infected t where t t t it is of course known that 5 t 0 for t 0 and moreover we have lim t t m if 1 0 we introduce a force of infection term f 1 to model the transmission of the virus from the infected to the uninfected in the reservoir we have d dt 1 3 2 a d dt 1 m 3 2 b 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 c this system assumes that there is no vertical transmission to reservoir offspring and that the virus has no deleterious effect on the reservoir an invariant rectangles argument shows that the solution components remain non negative in addition since 0 t max m 0 for all t 0 we can use the fact that t t t to conclude that 0 t t max m 0 for all t 0 we will again use the state variables s t e t i t c t r t for the host population and the differential equations describing the circulation of the disease within the host pop ulation are basically the same differing only by the inclusion of interspecies transmission from the vector reservoir we introduce a term of the form s 0 to account for transmission from the infected reservoir this becomes a loss term for the susceptible hosts and gain term for the exposed hosts again a variant of the seir model is used to describe the propagation of the disease within the host population we have variables s e i and r together with the variable c s e i and r represent the standard seir components the susceptible class the exposed class the infected class individuals who are fully infected by the virus and capable of transmitting and the removed class the contaminated class is given by c susceptible hosts can contract the disease by contact with the vector reservoir or they can contract it by contact with infected or contaminated individuals the force of infection term which accounts for transmission of the virus to the susceptible class from the infected reservoir as well as transmission from the infective and contaminated hosts has the form f 2 s i c 2 si s sc where 2 and are positive constants the equations that describe the circulation of the pathogen among the host 6 population now become ds dt 2 is s sc 3 3 a de dt 2 is s sc e 3 3 b di dt 1 e i 3 3 c dc dt 1 i c 3 3 d dr dt 2 e 2 i 3 3 e s 0 s 0 e 0 e 0 i 0 i 0 c 0 c 0 r 0 r 0 3 3 f neither the transmission of the virus nor the demographics in the reservoir are affected by the dynamics of the virus in the host we are able to analyze the dynamical behavior of the reservoir 3 3 a 3 3 f independently proposition 3 1 if 2 m 0 0 0 then there exists a globally bounded non negative solution pair t t to 3 3 a 3 3 c with max t 0 t t max m 0 0 0 moreover if 1 m then lim t t t m 0 if 1 m then lim t t t 1 1 1 m 1 proof following the reasoning of theorem 2 1 the structure of the reaction vector field and the non negativity of guarantees that t t 0 furthermore since t is uniformly bounded and t t t we are assured a globally bounded non negative solution t t t to 3 2 a 3 2 c and from our previous comments 0 t t max m 0 for all t 0 in addition from our earlier discussion we have lim t t m consequently we can determine the asymptotic behavior of t by substituting t t t and replacing t with t m m in 3 2 b rewriting the equation gives d dt 1 m t m 1 m 1 1 2 3 4 if we define t 1 m t m then lim t t 0 if 1 m then d dt t 1 2 as a result the nonnegativity of t and 0 0 imply that lim t t 0 7 consequently lim t t lim t t m if 1 m then the nonnegativity of t 3 4 and 0 0 imply lim t t 1 1 m 1 consequently since lim t t m and t t t we obtain lim t t 1 theorem 3 2 assume 1 2 1 2 0 with 1 2 and 1 2 if s 0 e 0 i 0 0 0 0 and c 0 r 0 0 then there exists a globally bounded non negative solution s t e t i t c t t t to 3 2 a 3 2 c 3 3 a 3 3 f with max t 0 s t e t i t c t s 0 e 0 i 0 c 0 and max t 0 t t max 0 0 m moreover lim t e t lim t i t lim t c t 0 if 1 m then lim t s t s 0 and lim t t t m 0 if 1 m then lim t s t 0 and lim t t t 1 1 1 m 1 proof the arguments establishing global existence non negativity and uniform bounds as well as the convergence of e t i t and c t are essentially the same as those given in theorem 2 1 and will not be repeated the dynamics of t t is independent of the host population and its asymptotic behavior is given by proposition 3 1 all that remains is the asymptotic behavior of s t however when 1 m we know that lim t t 0 and as a result the asymptotic behavior is determined by 2 1 a 2 1 e implying lim t s t s 0 in the case of 1 m we know lim t t 1 1 m 1 0 and consequently 3 3 a implies s t k 1 s t for some k 1 0 therefore lim t s t 0 4 spatial outbreak model the next model is concerned with a dispersing spatially distributed population we assume that our population is confined to a bounded region in r 2 with smooth boundary such 8 that lies locally on one side of the state variables s e i c represent time dependent spatial densities of the susceptible exposed infective and contaminated classes the time dependent populations of these classes are obtained by integration over that is s t s x t dx e t e x t dx i t i x t dx c t c x t dx population dispersion is modeled by fickian diffusion with spatially dependent diffusivities d 2 and d 3 for the susceptible and exposed classes respectively we further assume that d 2 d 3 0 and are smooth on we remark that for the sake of mathematical completeness we allow distinct diffusivities for suspectible and exposed densities since we assume that exposed individuals exhibit no adverse effects from the disease this is unnecessary for our model however since infective infectious are severely ill we assume spatial distribution but no diffusion similarly contaminated individuals are spatially dispersed with no diffusion the boundary conditions s e 0 on for t 0 insure that the populations remain confined to for all time the infection kinetics are essentially the same as those given for the initial ordinary differential equation with the only difference being that we assume the contact rates x s x t i x t and x s x t c x t are spatially dependent these considerations give rise to the following coupled system of partial differential equations and evolving ordinary differential equations s t d 2 x s x si x sc x t 0 4 1 a e t d 3 x e x si x sc e x t 0 4 1 b i t 1 e i x t 0 4 1 c c t 1 i c x t 0 4 1 d s e 0 x t 0 4 1 e s x 0 s 0 x e x 0 e 0 x i x 0 i 0 x c x 0 c 0 x x 4 1 f recall that e is the rate of transfer from the exposed class 1 2 and the rate of transfer from the exposed class to the recovered class by warding off the infection is given by 2 e the infection induced mortality is i 1 2 and 2 i represents recovery the time dependent removed population r t which includes those who have become immune through exposure and those who have become immune through recovery as well as those who have perished satisfies dr dt 2 e x t dx 2 i x t dx c x t dx 9 r t gives a measure of the impact of the infection but does not feed back into the dynamics of the system and therefore will not be given further discussion these considerations produce the system 4 1 a 4 1 f of coupled semi linear diffusion equations with parametrically evolving ordinary differential equations a system such as 4 1 a 4 1 f is often called partially dissipative 11 19 we shall make use of the following lemma which guarantees uniform a priori c 2 1 0 bounds for solutions to the nonhomogeneous linear diffusion equations we extract the details of the proof from arguments for more general results appearing in 12 which are predicated on fundamental parabolic theory of 9 lemma 4 1 assume that is a bounded region in r 2 with smooth boundary such that lies locally on one side of d c 2 0 and v 0 c 2 if p 1 t 0 and f lp 0 t then there exists a unique v w 2 1 p 0 t solving v t d x v f x t x t 0 v 0 x t 0 v x 0 v 0 x x and there exists a constant cp t 0 independent of f and v 0 so that v 2 1 p 0 t cp t v 0 2 f p 0 t 4 2 furthermore if p n 2 2 and f lp 2 for all 0 then v c 1 2 and there exists a constant np independent of f and v 0 so that v 1 2 np f p 2 v p 2 4 3 finally if f c 2 0 t for some 0 1 then v c 2 1 0 t and if 0 then there exists m t 0 independent of f and v 0 so that v 2 1 t m t v 0 2 f 2 0 t 4 4 proof 4 2 follows from 9 pg 341 now suppose p n 2 2 0 and f lp 2 let h c 2 0 1 such that h 0 0 and h t 1 for all 1 t 2 define w x t v x t h t then w solves w t d x w hf vh x t 2 w 0 x t 2 w x 0 0 x 10 then estimate 4 2 applied to this system implies w 2 1 p 2 cp 2 hf vh p 2 kcp 2 f p 2 v p 2 where k h 2 since p n 2 2 it follows from 9 that w 2 1 p 2 2 imbeds continusly into l 2 2 implying 4 3 holds 4 4 follows from a similar argument by employing classical estimates and sobolev imbedding the following requirements will guarantee the global well posedness and uniform bound edness of solutions to 4 1 a 4 1 f condition i is a bounded region in r 2 with smooth boundary such that lies locally on one side of d 2 d 3 c 2 and d 2 d 3 for some 0 1 2 0 with 1 2 1 2 0 with 1 2 and 0 c 1 with for some 0 we can insure that 4 1 a 4 1 f is well posed with globally bounded classical solutions theorem 4 2 assume that all requirement of condition i are satisfied if s 0 e 0 i 0 c 0 c 2 are nonnegative and s 0 is not identically 0 then there exists a unique componentwise nonnegative uniformly sup norm bounded classical solution s e i c c 2 1 0 to 4 1 a 4 1 f furthermore there exists a constant s 0 such that lim t s t s lim t e t lim t i t lim t c t 0 proof the weakly coupled system is structurally similar to a hodgkin huxley system and we can adapt the greens function variation of parameters methods cf 4 7 to establish the local well posedness and a maximal time interval of existence 0 tmax moreover solutions to 4 1 a 4 1 f exist globally i e tmax provided they do not blow up in the sup norm in finite time because the crux of the global existence argument relies on establishing a priori bounds we shall not provide the specific details of the argument insuring that tmax instead we will assume that our solutions are globally well posed and focus on the argument producing these bounds and given this assumption produce uniform a prior bounds the invariant region theory of 17 insures that the solutions remain nonnegative in addition it 11 is immediately clear that the maximum principle implies s t s 0 also if we sum the equations above and integrate over we have d dt s e i c dx min 2 2 e i c dx 0 as a result we have a uniform l 1 bound for each component of our system and lim t t 1 t e x t i x t c x t dxdt 0 4 5 in addition the sum of the components of the reaction vector field associated with s and e is nonpositive and s is bounded so regardless of the presence of i and c the uniform boundedness results of 12 can be adapted to guarantee that for every 1 p there is a constant cp 0 providing a uniform space time cylinder bound e p t t 1 cp for all t 0 4 6 consequently if q 1 then t 1 t e x t qdxdt t 1 t e x t dxdt t 1 t e x t 2 q 1 dxdt therefore if we apply 4 5 4 6 and the nonnegativity of e we can conclude that e q t t 1 0 as t for all q 1 4 7 if we multiply 4 1 c by ip 1 and invoke young s inequality we can observe that if 0 then there exists k 0 so that 1 p t i p eip 1 ip k e p ip 4 8 so if we choose so that 0 2 we have t ip pk e p p 2 ip 4 9 therefore if a p 2 and b pk then i x t p exp at i 0 x p b t 0 exp a t e x pd 4 10 let k be a nonnegative integer then k 1 k i x t pdxdt k 1 k exp at i 0 x pdxdt 4 11 b k 1 k t 0 exp a t e x pdxdt 12 we examine the second term on the right hand side of 4 11 and obtain k 1 k t 0 exp a t e x pd dxdt k 1 k k j 1 j j 1 exp a t e x pd dxdt k 1 k t k exp a t e x pd dxdt k j 1 k 1 k j j 1 exp a j 1 e x pd dxdt cp p cp p k j 1 exp a j 1 1 cp p 1 1 exp a 1 as a result for any p 1 there exists ce p 0 such that e p k k 1 ce p 4 12 independent of k consequently similar to 4 7 we can conclude that e q t t 1 0 as t for all q 1 4 13 in a similar fashion we can conclude that for any p 1 there exists ci p 0 so that i p k k 1 ci p 4 14 independent of k consequently similar to 4 7 and 4 13 we can conclude that i q t t 1 0 as t for all q 1 4 15 now we return to equation 4 1 b for e and view the nonlinearity as a forcing term f x t s x t i x t s x t c x t e x t then lemma 4 1 4 3 and the results above imply e is bounded independent of t and e 0 as t 4 16 we can apply this estimate to 4 1 c to conclude that i t is bounded independent of t and i 0 as t 4 17 13 finally we can apply this estimate to 4 1 d to conclude that c t is bounded inde pendent of t and c 0 as t 4 18 now we reconsider 4 1 a multiplying both sides by s and integrating by parts gives s x t 2 dx 2 t 0 d 2 x s x t 2 dxdt s 0 x 2 dx implying t 1 t d 2 x s x t 2 dxdt 0 as t 4 19 if we now multiply both sides of 4 1 a by st integrate by parts employ the uniform bound on s 4 16 4 17 4 18 and 4 19 we can conclude that there exists k 0 so that d dt s x t 2 dx k for all t 0 4 20 finally from 4 1 a we can see that d dt s x t dx 0 as a result since s 0 we can conclude that there exists s 0 so that 1 s x t dx s as t as a result 4 19 implies s t s 2 0 as t then the standard boot strapping can be employed to guarantee that s t s 0 as t we now claim that s 0 since s 0 is not identically 0 standard arguments imply s x t 0 for all x and t 0 and there exist t 0 0 such that s x t 0 for all x we define w x t s x t ln s x t for x and t t 0 and note that w x t 0 for x and t t 0 moreover we may observe that wt 1 1 s st 4 21 a d 2 x w 1 1 s d 2 x s 1 s 2 d 2 x s 2 4 21 b it is also clear that w x t 0 for all x t t 0 4 22 therfore w x t satisfies wt d 2 x w f x t x t t 0 w 0 x t t 0 w x t 0 s t 0 ln x 14 where f si sc i c from the estimates above we know 0 f x t dxdt as a result we can use the comparison principle to observe that w t 1 s t 0 ln t 0 f x t dxdt for all t t 0 therefore from the definition of w and the asymptotic behavior of s we know that s ln s therefore s 0 remark 4 3 the assumption in theorem 4 2 that the initial data is smooth can be relaxed to allow the initial data to only be nonnegative and continuous on provided we are not interested in classical solutions in this case we can still obtain the global well posedness uniform bounds and asymptotic behavior in theorem 4 2 but the i and c components will have no more smoothness in the spatial variable than their initial data since any lack of smoothing present in the initial data for i and c will propagate with time in the absence of initial smoothness of i and c the argument for the persistence of s x t becomes more involved the s and e components will immediately become smooth regardless due to the presence of diffusion in 4 1 a and 4 1 b we note that model shows that in the long term if there is no external source of the infection over the long term it will disappear in the host and the host population will survive the disease 5 spatially inhomogeneous reservoir population in this section we analyze the qualitative behavior of a diffusive si model that includes demographics this model will subsequently be used as component of a spatial temporal host reservoir model we begin with a discussion of generic spatially inhomogeneous diffusive logistic partial differential equations of the form v t d x v g x t v r x v 2 x t 0 5 1 a v 0 x t 0 5 1 b v x 0 v 0 x x 5 1 c these equations are the commonly called fisher kolmogorov equations in the case when g x t is independent of t the fk equations are well known in the literature and frequently arising in population dynamics ecology and population genetics as well as in other contexts our interest lies in the special case when there exists a c such that g t a 15 0 as t in particular we are interested in the relation between the solution to 5 1 a 5 1 c and solutions to d x u a x u r x u 2 x 5 2 a u 0 x 5 2 b it turns out that the question is intimately tied to the eigenvalue problem d x a x x 5 3 a 0 x 5 3 b theorem 5 1 assume is a bounded region in r 2 with smooth boundary such that lies locally on one side of g c r and a c such that g t a 0 as t and d c 2 and r c with 0 min x d x r x if v 0 c with v 0 and not identically 0 then there exists a unique nonnegative classical solution to 5 1 a 5 1 c on 0 with 0 v x t max v 0 a rmin for all x t 0 in addition if the principal eigenvalue of 5 3 a 5 3 b is positive then there is a unique positive solution u to 5 2 a 5 2 b and v t u 0 as t if the principal eigenvalue of 5 3 a 5 3 b is negative then there is no positive solution to 5 2 a 5 2 b and v t 0 exponentially as t proof the results associated with 5 2 a 5 2 b can be found in chapter 3 of 3 and also 5 for the remaining portion let h x y a x r x y for x y r r and suppose u solves u t d x u h x u u x t 0 5 4 a u 0 x t 0 5 4 b u x 0 v 0 x x 5 4 c suppose the principal eigenvalue of 5 3 a 5 3 b is positive then there exists 0 so that for each r with the principal eigenvalue for 5 3 a 5 3 b with a x replaced by a x is positive and consequently there exists a unique positive soluition u to d x u h x u u x t 0 5 5 a u 0 x t 0 5 5 b 16 also from results in 3 u t u 0 as t and since g x y is strictly increasing in results in 3 imply u x is increasing in and consequently u t v t u t for 0 and t sufficiently large now consider the eigenvalue problem d x h 0 x u x 5 6 a 0 x 5 6 b note that 0 and u solve this problem in addition u 0 therefore 0 is the principal eigenvalue for 5 6 a 5 6 b consequently the principal eigenvalue of d x h 0 x u u y h 0 x u x x 5 7 a 0 x 5 7 b is negative since u x y h 0 x u u x r x 0 therefore the implicit function theorem implies that for we have u u 0 as 0 which implies v t u 0 as t the case when the principal eigenvalue for 5 3 a 5 3 b is negative can be handled by combining the comparison principle and results in chapter 3 of 3 remark 5 2 if a x dx 0 then the principal eigenvalue for 5 3 a 5 3 b is positive and this is certainly the case when a x is nonnegative and positive on a subset of of positive measure the pathogens causing the disease are harbored in the reservoir host the reservoir provides an environment in which they naturally live and reproduce we will be modeling the spread of a non lethal virus through a population that remains confined to a geographic region which mathematically described as a bounded region of r 2 the pathogens are assumed to be transmitted horizontally through the reservoir population with no vertical transmission to offspring the presence of pathogens has no negative impact on the reservoir the popu lation divides into two compartments the susceptible and the infected the time dependent population densities of the these two compartments are represented by x t and x t respectively the total population density is given by x t x t x t the disper sion of the population in each compartment is modeled by fickian diffusion with diffusivity d x the infection is transmitted through the vector reservoir by a spatially heterogeneous force of infection f x x individuals that become infected remain infected 17 with no recovery each of the compartments are subject to depletion by spatially dependent logistic mortality m x with the uninfected population replenished by a spatially dependent birth term which depends linearly on the total population density such models can be called spatially dependent logistic susceptible infective si models and they give rise to the following coupled system of reaction diffusion

2 x t 0 5 9 0 x 18 proof one can apply variety of different arguments to establish the existence of a maximal interval of existence 0 tmax and guarantee on this interval 0 this reduced the problem to one of establishing uniform a priori bounds for on 0 tmax theorem 1 of 2 insures that 0 max 0 mmin we add equations 5 8 b 5 8 c observing that x t x t x t and using the nonnegativity of solutions components to complete the argument that solutions are uniformly bounded and globally well posed theorem 5 1 and remark 5 2 imply lim t t 0 we consider the positive steady state solution of 5 9 as a predetermined quantity and introduce the function r x x 1 x m x we shall see that if a x r x in 5 2 a 5 2 b and the associated principal eigenvalue of 5 3 a 5 3 b is negative then the reservoir converges to a pathogen free steady state however if the associated principal eigenvalue is positive then the pathogen persists in the reservoir and we are assured that t and t converge to a positive endemic steady state in the next section we shall also see that this persistence or non persistence determines whether or not the susceptible host population survives the infection the uniform a priori l bounds on and insure that their time derivatives gradi ents and the time derivative of their gradients all have uniform a prioiri l bounds cf 17 p 226 proposition 5 4 suppose the conditions of theorem 5 3 are satisfied solve 5 8 a 5 8 e and 0 then the sup norms over of t t t t t and t are bounded independent of t for all t we are now in a position to characterize the long term behavior of and theorem 5 5 assume the conditions of theorem 5 3 hold r x x 1 x m x and let 0 be the principal eigenvalue of 5 3 a 5 3 b associated iwth a x r x if 0 0 then there exists a unique positive endemic steady state such that d 1 x x 1 x m x x d 1 x 1 x m x x 0 x if 0 0 then there is no nontrivial endemic steady state and we have lim t t lim t t 0 19 proof theorem 5 1 insures a unique strictly positive steady state solution to 5 8 a 5 8 b such that lim t t 0 using the fact that we reduce the system to the two component system t d 1 x x m x 2 x t 0 5 10 a t d 1 x 1 x m x 1 x 2 x t 0 5 10 b theorem 5 1 implies solutions to 5 10 a converge uniformly to x 0 so we confine our analysis to 5 10 b subject to 5 8 a 5 8 e note that t 1 m r 0 as t consequently we can use theorem 5 1 to obtain the result we can say more concerning the convergence of t as t the following result will be useful in the next section corollary 5 6 assume the conditions of theorem 5 5 hold if 0 0 then 0 0 x t dxdt proof the result follows immediately from theorem 5 1 and the exponential convergence of t to 0 as t 6 spatial spread of a vector reservoir supported virus in this section we consider the impact of a localized infected reservoir on the spread of the virus among a disturbed host population across a larger population the host population inhabits and is confined to a bounded region in r 2 with smooth boundary such that lies locally on one side of as in the preceding case the variables s e i and c represent time dependent spatial densities of the susceptible exposed infective and contaminated classes the time dependence populations are obtained by integration over the host dispersion across the region is modeled by diffusion the diffusivities of susceptible and exposed hosts are given by d 2 x and d 3 x respectively the reservoir population remains confined to a proper sub region of with smooth boundary such that lies locally on one side of homogeneous neumann boundary conditions are imposed on the hosts and the vector reservoir on the boundaries of and issues of global well posedness and long term behavior of the reaction diffusion system modeling the dynamics of the disease in the reservoir population appeared in the previous section a spatially dependent force of infection accounts for transmission of the disease to the host from the infected reservoir this results in a force of infection of the form f 2 x s i c 2 x si x s x sc 20 here 2 c 1 with 2 0 on and 0 on and l is a c 1 function on with 0 on and 0 on we have the following system that couples a reaction diffusion system on with a partially dissipative system on t d 1 x x m x 2 x t 0 6 1 a t d 1 x x 1 x m x x t 0 6 1 b t d 1 x 1 x m x x t 0 6 1 c 0 x t 0 6 1 d x 0 0 x x 0 0 x x 0 0 x x 6 1 e s t d 2 x s x si x sc x s x t 0 6 1 f e t d 3 x e x si x sc x s e x t 0 6 1 g i t 1 e i x t 0 6 1 h c t 1 i ci x t 0 6 1 i s e 0 x t 0 6 1 j s x 0 s 0 x e x 0 e 0 x i x 0 i 0 x c x 0 c 0 x x 6 1 k we introduce the following requirements for the system that couples the spatial dynamics of the reservoir on subdomain with the dynamics of the host on the larger domain condition iii is a bounded region in r 2 with smooth boundary such that lies locally on one side of and is a proper subregion of with smooth boundary such that lies locally on one side of d 1 c 2 and d 1 0 1 m c 1 and 1 m 0 l and c 1 such that 0 on and 0 on d 2 d 3 c 2 with d 2 d 3 0 1 2 1 2 0 with 1 2 and 1 2 21 c 1 with 0 0 0 0 c 2 0 with 0 0 0 s 0 e 0 i 0 c 0 c 2 0 we remark that if is not identically 0 the function x can create a spatial discontinuity of f 2 x s i c across the boundary of so we are not able to obtain the classical smooth solutions that we have had with a smooth force of infection term however it is still possible to obtain so called classical strong solutions definition 6 1 we say the functions s e i c on 0 and on 0 constitue a classical strong solution to 6 1 a 6 1 k if and only if s e i c c 0 and c 0 c 2 1 t w 2 1 p t for each p 1 and 0 t s e w 2 1 p t for each p 1 and 0 t i c c 1 0 c the partial differential equations boundary conditions and the initial conditions 6 1 a 6 1 k are satisfied our well posedness result for the spatially heterogeneous host reservoir system follows theorem 6 2 if the requirements of condition iii are satisfied then there exists a unique classical strong componentwise nonnegative solution to 6 1 a 6 1 k furthermore the solu tion is componentwise uniformly bounded in the sup norm proof we observe that there is no cross feedback from infected host to the uninfected reservoir so the existence of a classical solution c 2 1 0 t w 2 1 p t for each p 1 and 0 t satisfying 6 1 a 6 1 e is guaranteed by the analog of theorem 5 3 on and is independent of the evolution of the infection in the host furthermore this solution is componentwise nonnegative and uniformly bounded in the sup norm we can thereby assume as given this allows us to focus on 6 1 f 6 1 k standard arguments insure the local well posedness of nonnegative solutions on an interval 0 tmax and tmax if solutions are bounded in the sup norm on every finite time interval the maximum principle immediately insures the existence of a ms 0 such that s t ms for all t 0 then the form of the right hand sides of the differential equations for e i and c 22 clearly result in e i and c being bounded in the sup norm on every finite time interval and we can conclude that tmax we can now apply the arguments of developed in theorem 4 2 to produce uniform lp k k 1 bounds for each p 1 independent of the positive integer k of the form s p k k 1 e p k k 1 i p k k 1 c p k k 1 cp these in turn can be used to give uniform w 2 1 p k k 1 bounds for each p 1 of the form s 2 1 p k k 1 e 2 1 p k k 1 kp then p can be chosen sufficiently large to insure that e 0 is bounded the uniform boundeds on e allow us to obtain uniform bounds on i and c directly from their equations and the result follows the asymptotic impact of our vector reservoir on the host population hinges on the following eigenvalue problem d x x a x x x x 6 2 a 0 x 6 2 b where a x x 1 x m x theorem 6 3 if the conditions of theorem 6 2 hold then there exists a positive steady state of 6 1 a and a constant s 0 such that lim t s t s lim t t 0 in addition lim t e t lim t i t lim t c t 0 finally if the principal eigenvalue of 6 2 a 6 2 b is positive then there exists an endemic steady state 0 on so that lim t t lim t t 0 and s 0 if the principal eigenvalue of 5 2 a b is negative then s 0 and lim t t lim t t 0 proof if the principal eigenvalue of 6 2 a 6 2 b is positive then an analog of theorem 5 5 guarantees the uniform convergence of t t t to a steady state solution 23 of 6 1 a 6 1 d such that 0 moreover it insures that there exists a k l with k positive and continuous on and k 0 on and t 0 so that x x t k x for t t in this case we have s t d 2 x s k x s for x t t we introduce the operator on c defined by a k u x d 2 u x k x u x d ak u c u c 2 u 0 on then 8 13 15 guarantee a k generates a positive analytic semigroup t k t t 0 on c with t k t exp t for some 0 consequently we have s t s 0 exp t hence lim t s t 0 if we use the uniform bounds on i c and along with the exponential decay of s t then the positivity of implies there are constants k 0 so that e t k exp t then thi sdecay estimate and equations 6 1 h 6 1 i imply similar decay estimates for i and c that is lim t e t lim t i t lim t c t 0 with the decay being exponential if the principal eigenvalue of 6 2 a 6 2 b is negative then an analog of theorem 5 5 guarantees uniform convergence of t to a positive steady state solution of 6 1 a 6 1 d in addition lim t t 0 and lim t t 0 with the latter decay being exponential as above lim t e t lim t i t lim t c t 0 we observe that s t the spatial average of s t is decreasing and consequently there exists s 0 such that lim t s t lim t 1 s x t dx s 0 it remains to show that s 0 we define f x t s x i x t x c x t x x t s by applying the sup norm bounds on and and the exponential decay of t c t and t we can apply reasoning similar to the proof of theorem 4 2 applied only to the equation for s to conclude that s 0 24 7 conclusion and further discussion we have seen that in both the spatial independent case and the spatially dependent case the infection will be extinguished over the long term in the host population if there is no interaction with the infected reservoir population indeed a high rate of mortality enhances the rapidity of the disappearance to the infection on the other hand contact with the infected reservoir can have dire consequences for the long term persistence of the susceptible host population we have observed in the spatially dependent case that the function r x x 1 x m x and an eigenvalue problem play a critical role if the principal eigenvalue is negative then the virus decays to zero in the reservoir this is the case if 1 x m x 0 in if it is positive it converges to a strictly positive endemic steady state if the infection converges to a positive endemic steady state we have seen that the susceptible host population converges to zero and if the infection in the reservoir converges to zero the host persists and converges to a positive steady state this is the case if 1 x m x 0 on here we are totally consistent with the spatially independent case where we set r 1 m and the number r plays the role of the reproductive number there are issues with the applicability of this model to outbreak of the ebola virus in human populations fruit bats are generally believed to be the natural hosts or reservoir of the ebola virus with a wide range of mammals as well as humans serving as accidental hosts the ebola virus has been implicated in the catastrophic decline in primate populations in western equatorial africa we feel that our model may be most applicable in describing the transmission of ebola from fruit bats to primates and other indigenous mammals it can be argued that a realistic model might include indirect environmental transmission as developed in 7 20 in the case of the ebola outbreaks in humans the model should include a linkage to infected bush meat 6 in sub saharan africa there is a wide spread tradition of harvesting processing and consuming bush meat 14 the term bush meat covers a plethora of wild animals which includes non human primates rats and other rodents antelopes bush pigs and pangolin as well as bats subsequent work will address more complex models that incorporate a variety of intermediate hosts involved in the transfer of the ebola virus from fruit bats to humans as well as including indirect environmental transmission 25 references 1 bailey n t j
