march 27 2020 abstract solutions of functional differential equation of pointwise type fdept are in one to one correspondence with the traveling wave type solutions for the canonically induced infinite dimensional ordinary differential equation and vice versa in particular such infinite dimensional ordinary differential equations are finite difference analogues of equations of mathematical physics an important class of traveling wave type solutions is made up of periodic and bounded traveling wave type solutions on the other hand an important class of such systems is systems with strongly nonlinear potentials polynomial potentials for which periodic and bounded traveling wave solutions are studied such a problem is equivalent to the study of periodic and bounded solutions of the induced fdept to which the present work is devoted 2010 mathematical subject classification 39 b 22 keywords and phrases functional differential equations soliton solutions korteweg de vries equation polynomial potential periodic solitons 1 introduction for equations of mathematical physics which are the euler lagrange equation of the corresponding variational problems an important class of solutions are soliton solutions 1 2 in a number of models such solutions are well approximated by soliton solutions for finite difference analogues of the initial equations which in place of a continuous environment describe the interaction of clumps of a environment placed at the vertices of the lattice 1 3 emerging systems belong to the class of infinite dimensional dynamical systems the most widely considered classes of such problems are infinite systems with frenkel kontorova potentials periodic and slowly growing potentials and fermi pasta ulam potentials of exponential growth a broad survey of which is given in the paper 4 the study of soliton solutions solutions of the traveling wave is based on the existence of a one to one correspondence between soliton solutions for infinite dimensional dynamical systems and solutions of induced functional differential equations of pointwise type fdept 5 in case of the quasilinear right hand side of the functional differential equation in fact the described connection between solutions of the traveling wave type of the infinite dimensional dynamical system and solutions of the induced fdept is a fragment of a more general scheme that goes beyond the scope of this article periodic soliton solutions of an infinite dimensional dynamical system form an important class of solutions for both quasilinear and polynomial potentials it is important that the investigation of soliton solutions of an infinite dimensional dynamical system is equivalent to the investigation of solutions of an induced fdept another class of problems is related to the study of soliton solutions for equations of mathematical physics without using finite difference analogs at the same time the potentials can have lags in time in this case the induced equation for traveling waves also turns out to be a fdept e mail lbeklaryan outlook om e mail abeklaryan hse ru 2 l beklaryan a beklaryan for both classes of problems the existence and uniqueness theorem for a solution of an induced fdept 5 guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a soliton solution with given initial values for systems with quasilinear potential moreover for systems with a quasilinear potential one can formulate the conditions for the existence of a periodic solution the formulated conditions as well as the estimate of the radius of the ball in which the solution is contained are given in terms of the characteristics of the right hand side of the induced fdept the lipschitz constant the deviation of the argument and the characteristic of the traveling wave it is very important that such conditions do not use information about the spectral properties of the linearized equation equations in variations that essentially simplifies their verification a system with a polynomial potential can be redefined by changing the potential outside a given ball so that the emerging potential turns out to be quasilinear if a guaranteed periodic soliton solution for such an overdetermined system lies in the ball outside which the potential is redefined then we obtain the conditions for the existence of a periodic soliton solution for the initial system with a polynomial potential another important task is the numerical realization of periodic soliton solutions for systems with a polynomial potential which has been successfully solved 2 functional differential equations of pointwise type the theory of functional differential equations developed in the works of many authors among which it is necessary to single out the works of myshkis bellman kato krasovsky krasnoselsky sharkovsky hale varga and others we consider a functional differential equation of pointwise type x t f t x q 1 t x qs t t br 1 where f r rns rn is a mapping of the c 0 class qj j 1 s are homeomorphisms of the line preserving orientation br is either closed interval t 0 t 1 or closed half line t 0 or line r the fdept under consideration is an ordinary differential equation if qj t t j 1 s is an equation with pure delays if qj t t j 1 s is an equation with pure advances if qj t t j 1 s the functions qj t t j 1 s are called deviations of the argument using time replacement we can always achieve the condition h max i 1 s hj hj sup t r qj t t j 1 s for deviations of the argument it is obvious that such a replacement of time can change the growth character of the right hand side of the equation with respect to the time variable the approach proposed for the study of such equations is based on a formalism whose central element is the construction using a finitely generated group q q 1 qs of homeomorphisms of the line the group operation in such a group is the superposition of two homeomorphisms the type of functional differential equations considered here is rather wide and in particular describes traveling wave solutions soliton solutions for finite difference analogues of the equations of mathematical physics at the same time the use of the specifics of such a class of equations related to group features makes it possible to obtain advanced results for them and also to establish obstacles that prevent such equations from inheriting the remarkable properties of solutions of ordinary differential equations definition 1 an absolutely continuous function x defined on r is called a solution of the equation 1 if for almost all t br the function x satisfies this equation if in addition x c k r rn k 0 1 then this solution is called a solution of the class c k lobachevskii journal of mathematics on the existence of periodic and bounded solutions for fdept 3 2 1 existence and uniqueness of a solution for the initial boundary value problem with quasilinear right hand side the main goal in the study of such differential equations is the investigation of the initial boundary value problem x t f t x q 1 t x qs t t br 2 x t t t r br l r r n 3 x t x t r x rn 4 which we will call the basic initial boundary value problem in a general situation when t 6 t 0 t 1 or deviations of the argument are arbitrary we have a problem with non local initial boundary conditions if there is no deviation of the argument qj t t j 1 s the boundary value problem becomes the cauchy problem for the ordinary differential equation if br t 0 t 1 or br t 0 then for t t 0 and for an equation with delays qj t t j 1 s or for t t 1 and for an equation with advances qj t t j 1 s the boundary value problem is transformed into the well known formulation of the initial problem for an equation with delays or advances in the argument it is important that in the noted cases the problem under consideration has initial boundary conditions of local type let s define a banach space of functions x with weights ln c k r x x c k r rn max 0 r k sup t r x r t t

considered as piecewise continuous function with discontinuities of the first kind at the points of a discrete set b quasilinear growth condition for any t zj z j j 1 s f t z 1 zs rn m 0 t m 1 s j 1

z m 0 t i i has a finite value for any t r and is continuous as a function of the argument t d for the from the item c the family of functions f i z 1 zs t f t i z 1 zs i i z z 1 zs r n is equicontinuous on any finite interval lobachevskii journal of mathematics 4 l beklaryan a beklaryan in the case of the finite interval of the definition br t 0 t 1 we assume that the function f satisfies the conditions a b if br is the half line or the whole line we assume that f satisfies the conditions a d the last condition d is necessary only in the case of a half line or a whole line it can be removed but this leads to more technical complications let s describe a very wide class of functions f satisfying the constraints a d remark 1 suppose that the function f has a representation f t z 1 zs f 1 z 1 zs t in which the continuous function satisfies the condition d and the function f 1 satisfies the lipschitz condition then the function f satisfies the conditions a d the right hand side f of fdept will be considered as an element of the banach space v r r ns rn v r r ns r n f f satisfies the conditions a d f lip sup t r f t 0 0 t rn sup t z 1 zs z 1 z s r 1 2 ns f t z 1 zs f t z 1 z s rn s j 1 zj z j rn where the parameter r coincides with the corresponding constant from the condition c obviously for the function f v r r ns rn the smallest value of the constant m 2 from the lipschitz condition the condition b coincides with the value of the second summand in the definition of the norm f in what follows speaking of the lipschitz condition by the constant m 2 we mean exactly its smallest value we have the following theorem on the existence and uniqueness of a solution theorem 1 6 if for some 0 0 1 the inequality m 2 s j 1 hj ln 1 is satisfied then for any fixed initial boundary conditions l r r n x rn there exists a solution absolutely continuous x ln c 0 r of the basic initial boundary value problem 2 4 such a solution is unique and as an element of the space ln c 0 r depends continuously on the initial boundary conditions l r r n x rn and the right hand side of the equation function f v r r ns rn 2 2 existence of a periodic solution for equations with quasilinear right hand side to simplify the presentation of the idea and the basic constructions of the proposed approach we restrict ourselves to the case where the homeomorphisms qj j 1 s are shifts i e qj t t nj nj r j 1 s without loss of generality we assume that n 1 ns for clarity in the presentation we confine ourselves to the case when the deviation values of the argument n 1 ns and the period of the right hand side of the equation with respect to the time variable are commensurable in this case without loss of generality we can assume that the quantities n 1 ns are integers the last property can be achieved by replacing the time with extension we consider periodic solutions of the equation x t f t x t n 1 x t ns t r 5 lobachevskii journal of mathematics on the existence of periodic and bounded solutions for fdept 5 with a time periodic right hand side let s formulate an existence theorem for a periodic solution in terms of averages over the period theorem 2 7 suppose that the map f satisfies the conditions a d and is a periodic function with respect to time where z if for given 0 0 1 r 0 and for all x rn x rn r it is true that m 2 s j 1 nj ln 1 x x rn 0 f x x d 1

variables z 1 zs such a lipschitz constant will be denoted by lf r remark 2 if the right hand side of the equation is differentiable with respect to the variables z 1 zs then it is locally lipschitz and for any ball with radius r 0 the lipschitz constant lf r is defined and is a monotonically increasing function over the r variable theorem 4 let the map f is locally lipschitz and periodic

proof we can redefine the right hand side of the equation outside the ball of radius r so that the resulting overdetermined function satisfies the lipschitz condition with the lipschitz constant equal to lf r then the theorem 4 is the statement of the theorem 2 for the equation with the redefined right hand side moreover due to the condition r r the obtained periodic solution will be a solution of
