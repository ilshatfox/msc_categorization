derivative 1 introduction fractional calculus including integrals and derivatives of arbitrary order is a generalization of classical integer order differentiation and integration 9 in the past few decades fractional calculus theory has played an important role in the fields of fluid mechanics physics entropy and engineering 4 7 8 12 fractional partial differential fpd equations are important tool to describe physical and natural phenomena such as damping laws rheology diffusion electrostatics electrodynamics fluid flows and so on 5 6 20 22 and in most of these applications it is too complicated to obtain exact solutions in terms of composite elementary functions so approximation and numerical techniques are used extensively such as the tanh method 26 the differential transform method 25 27 the homotopy perturbation method 18 24 the adomian decomposition method 15 23 the variational iteration method 13 the homotopy analysis method 1 3 14 the optimal homotopy asymptotic method 21 and finite mailto asadfreihat yahoo com difference method 19 in this paper we apply the rpsm to find series solution for fractional burgers huxley equations the rpsm is an effective and easy tool to construct a power series solution for strongly linear and nonlinear equations without linearization perturbation or discretization different from the classical power series method the rps method does not need to compare the coefficients of the corresponding terms and a recursion relation is not required the rpsm method does not require any conversion while switching from the low order to the higher order and from simple linearity to complex nonlinearity consequently the method can be applied directly to the given problem by choosing an appropriate initial guess approximation thus through rpsm explicit analytic solutions of nonlinear problems are possible to obtain the rpsm was developed as an efficient method for fuzzy differential equations 17 it has been advantageously implemented for the fractional foam drainage equation 10 for the time fractional two component evolutionary system of order two 11 and for other equations 16 the remainder of the paper is organized as follows in the next section we review some fundamental definitions and theorems of fractional calculus theory and fractional power series in section 3 the procedure of the rpsm is described and then the residual power series to fractional burgers huxley equations is derived in section 4 our algorithm is applied graphical and numerical results are presented and in section 5 conclusions are given 2 preliminaries this section seeks to describe the operational properties on factional calculus theory that will help us follow through the principle with the solutions of fractional partial differential equations there are many definitions of the fractional operators that have been constructed as riemann liouville grunwald letnikov weyl riesz and caputo in our work we will use caputo s definition since the derivative of the constant is zero and the initial conditions of the fractional pde s with caputo s derivatives take the usual form of the integer order pde s which reduces the

solution to the generalized fractional burgers huxley equation by substituting its power series ps expansion among its truncated residual function from the resulting equation a recursion formula for the computation of the coefficients is derived while the coefficients in the fractional ps expansion can be computed recursively by recurrent fractional differentiation of the truncated residual function the fractional burgers huxley equation has the form 0 0 10 1 2 2 xt txutxutxutxu x txutxu x txudt 3 1 subject to the initial condition 0 xcxu 3 2 where are real constants and is a positive integer the rps method assumes the solution for the equation 3 1 as fractional power series about the initial point 0 t as follows 0 10 1 0 rtix m t xctxu m m n 3 3 next we let txuk to denote the k th truncated series of txu i e 0 10 1 0 rtix m t xctxu k m m mk 3 4 by using the initial condition 3 2 the 0 th rps approximate solution of txu is 0 00 xcxuxctxu 3 5 also in general the k th rps approximate solution of txu can be written in the form 3 2 1 0 10 1 1 krtix m t xcxctxu k m m mk 3 6 now we define the residual function for eq 3 1 as 1 re 2 2 txutxutxu txu x txutxu x txudtxs tu 3 7 and the k th residual function has the form 1 re 2 2 txutxutxu txu x txutxu x txudtxs kkk kkkktku 3 8 as in 19 20 0 re txs and re relim txstxsk k for all ix and 0 t therefore 0 re txsd i t since the fractional derivative of a constant in the caputo s sense is 0 also the fractional derivative i td of re txs and re txsk is matching at 0 t for each 2 1 0 ki now to clarify the rps technique we substitute 3 6 in eq 3 8 to get 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 re 1 11 11 1 2 2 1 k m m m k m m m k m m m k m m m k m m m k m m m k m m mtku m t xcxc m t xcxc m t xcxc m t xcxc xm t xcxc m t xcxc xm t xcxcdtxs 3 9

in fact it is very convenient to perform computations by using the mathematica software package 4 application and numerical results in this section we will generalize a classical test problem from burgers huxley equation into a fractional one by replacing the first time derivative by a fractional derivative of order 10 then we will apply the rps method demonstrated above on this problem later graphics and numerical results will be discussed application 1 consider the following time fractional burgers equation 0 0 10 1 1 xt txutxutxutxutxutxutxud xxxt 4 1 subject to the initial conditions 0

2 2 t xcxcxcxcxcxcxc t xcxcxcxcxctxu 4 7 thus by using the same manner as above and from eq 3 10 solving the equation 0 0 re 3 2 xsd ut results in the following formula 32 1 21 1 34 1 112 2 2 23 xcxcxcxc xcxcxcxcxcxcxcxc and the third rps approximate solution is 31 32 1 21 1 34 21 1 34 1 1 3 1 112 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 2 3 t xcxcxcxc xcxcxcxcxcxcxc t xcxcxcxcxcxcxc t xcxcxcxcxctxu 4 8 if we repeat the same procedures for 6 5 4 k we will get the rps approximate solutions of our time fractional problem in this application we study the solutions of the time fractional burgers huxley equation numerically in order to validate the efficiency and accuracy of the rps method we will compare between the exact solution and the 4 th approximate solutions figure 1 explores the fourth rps

solutions for various values of and we observe that each of the subfigures is nearly coinciding and similar in their behavior the graphical results in provide a numerical estimate for the convergence of the rps method in predict the solitary pattern solution anyhow the accuracy is in advanced by using only few terms of approximations indeed we can conclude that higher accuracy can be achieved by computing further terms to show the accuracy of the method numerical results at 4 with some selected grid points for 10 are given in table 1 from the table it can be seen that the present method

9 has the form 1 re 22 2 2 txutxutxu x txutxu x txudtxs kkkkkktku 4 12 to determine 1 xc we consider 1 k in equation 4 12 and substitute 1 11 t xcxctxu in the 1 th residual function re 1 txsu to get 1 3 2 1 1 2 3 1 1 1 re 3 113 2 12 1 12 1 2 1 1 1 2 11 txcxc xc txcxcxcxcxc xc txcxcxcxcxcxcxc xcxcxcxcxcxctxsu from eq 3 10 we deduce that 0 0 re 1 xsu and thus 1 1 xcxcxcxcxcxc therefore the first rps

using the same manner as above we get 0 2 xc so the second rps approximate solution is 1 1 2 t xcxcxcxcxcxctxu 4 14 thus solving the equation 0 0 re 3 2 xsd ut results in the following recurrence formula 3 2 1 21 1 12 1 3 xcxcxcxcxc xc xc and the third rps approximate solution is 31 3 2 1 21 1 1 3 1 12 1 3 t xcxcxcxcxc xc t xcxcxcxcxcxctxu 4 15 repeat the same procedures for 6 5 4 k to get the

this work the rps method is successfully employed to solve the time fractional burgers huxley equations with variable pressure in two dimensions the given examples reveal that the rps method can be used as an alternative to obtain analytical solutions of time fractional nonlinear differential equations the proposed technique provides solutions in terms of rapidly convergent series with easily computable components which are in excellent agreement with the exact solutions when 1 as revealed by the numerical results the algorithm for this method is direct and easy because it is based on the recursive differentiation of time fractional dispersive and the application of a given initial constraints conditions so that we can compute the coefficient of the multiplicity fps solution with less
