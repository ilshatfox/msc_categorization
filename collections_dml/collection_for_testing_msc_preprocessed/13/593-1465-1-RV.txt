monomial ideals with quasi linear quotients aniqa ahmad 1 imran anwar 2 shaheen nazir 3 abstract in this paper we extend the notion of quasi linear quotients for a pure monomial ideal not necessarily square free of degree d we introduce the notion of quasi linear free resolution and show that if a pure monomial ideal i u 1 u 2 um of degree d in the polynomial ring s k x 1 xn admits quasi linear quotients then lq u 1 uq 1 uq admits quasi linear free resolution for all q m moreover we show that if a pure monomial ideal i of degree d admits quasi linear quotients then i t will also have quasi linear quotients for t d key words shellable simplicial complex facet ideal graded free resolution graded betti numbers betti diagram colon of monomial ideals 2000 mathematics subject classification primary 13 p 10 secondary 13 h 10 13 f 20 13 c 14 1 introduction the class of square free monomial ideals with quasi linear quotients was intro duced in 1 a monomial ideal is said to have quasi linear quotients if there exists a minimal monomial system of generators u 1 u 2 um of i such that 01 lk 6 0 for all 1 k m where lk u 1 u 2 uk 1 uk the concept of shellability has been the subject of a considerable number of geometric and algebraic investiga tions for instance see 2 3 4 and 6 the facet ideal if introduced in 5 of a pure shellable simplicial complex admits quasi linear quotients 2 moreover the class of monomial ideals with linear quotients introduced by herzog and takayama 7 is contained in the class of monomial ideals with quasi linear quotients the potential aim of this article is to study the monomial ideals with quasi liner quotients we introduce the notion of quasi linear free resolution and show that if a pure monomial ideal i u 1 u 2 um of degree d admits quasi linear quotients then lq u 1 uq 1 uq admits quasi linear free resolution for all q m we also show that if a pure monomial ideal i of degree d admits quasi linear quotients then i t will also have quasi linear quotients for t d acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the higher education commission pakistan for supporting this research under the project number 4234 1 comsats institute

we define some basic notions that we will use in the paper along with some background theory let s k x 1 xn denote the polynomial ring in n variables over an infinite field k with each deg xi 1 and i a monomial ideal of s the graded betti numbers i j i j i appear in the graded minimal free resolution f 0 j z s j h j j z s j 0 j i of i in s then i j i dimk tori i k j for all i and j there are two important invariants attached to a monomial ideal i s defined in terms of the minimal graded free resolution of i proj dim i max i i j i 6 0 reg i max j i i j i 6 0 for some i namely projective dimension and regularity of i respectively we say that i has a linear resolution if there exists an integer m 1 such that i i j 0 for all i and j with j 6 m thus in particular if i has a linear resolution then i is generated by homogeneous polynomials of the same degree definition 2 1 let i be a monomial ideal in s and u be any monomial in s then the colon ideal of i with respect to u is defined as i u f s fu i here we recall an important class of monomial ideals namely ideals with linear quotients along with some important results definition 2 2 let i s k x 1 xn be a monomial ideal we say that i has linear quotients if there exists a minimal monomial system of generators u 1 u 2 um of i such that lk is generated by linear forms for all 1 k m where lk u 1 u 2 uk 1 uk moreover for each k we denote the number of generators of lk by rk or in other words lk rk one of the reasons that makes ideals with linear quotient an important subject for considerations is due to the following result 6 proposition 8 2 1 theorem 2 3 suppose that i s is a graded ideal generated in degree d and that i has linear quotients then i has a d linear resolution 3 pure monomial ideals with quasi linear quotients in this section we will consider only monomial ideals with quasi linear quotients in the polynomial ring s k x 1 xn we say that a monomial ideal i s is pure of degree d if and only if 0 j i 0 for all j 6 d 2 definition 3 1 let i be a monomial ideal in s we define the indeg i as follows indeg i min j 0 j i 6 0 definition 3 2 let i s be a monomial ideal we say that i has quasi linear quotients if there exists a minimal monomial system of generators u 1 u 2 um of i such that indeg li 1 for all 1 i m where li u 1 u 2 ui 1 ui remark 3 3 let i s be a monomial ideal having linear quotients then i has quasi linear quotients as well therefore the class of ideals with quasi linear quotients is a generalization of the class of monomial ideals with linear quotients definition 3 4 we say that i has a quasi linear resolution if for each integer i with 0 i proj dim i there exists an integer j such that i j i 6 0 implies i 1 j 1 i 6 0 thus in particular if i will have a quasi linear resolution then there is at least one linear shift in each step of the minimal free resolution of i the following example is given to show the various aspects of quasi linear resolution of an ideal i example 3 5 let us consider the polynomial ring s k x 1 x 7 and monomial ideal i x 1 x 2 x 3 x 1 x 3 x 4 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 5 x 6 x 7 its minimal free resolution is as follows 0 s 7 s 4 4 s 6 s 3 5 i with betti diagram 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 3 5 4 0 4 0 0 0 5 0 1 1 one can see the linear shift in each step clearly theorem 3 6 let i s k x 1 xn be a pure monomial ideal of degree d minimally generated by u 1 u 2 um if i has quasi linear quotients then lq u 1 u 2 uq 1 uq has a quasi linear free resolution for all 1 q m proof since i has quasi linear quotients so lq has a variable as a generator for all 1 q m to show lq has a quasi linear free resolution it is enough to show that a monomial ideal containing a variable has a quasi linear free resolution let l be an ideal containing a variable we may assume that l j x 1 with x 1 supp j by using the definition of minimal graded free resolution one may obtain a minimal graded free resolution of l from a minimal graded free resolution of j as torsi l k j tor s i j k j tor s i 1 j 1 k j for all i 1 and tors 0 l k j tor s 0 x 1 k j tor s 0 j k j 3 now suppose that i 1 l 6 0 then i j 6 0 in fact if i j 0 then i 1 j 0 which implies i 1 l 0 a contradiction in particular there exists j such that i j j 6 0 the presence of torsi j k j tor s i 1 j 1 k j ensures that i j l 6 0 and i 1 j 1 l 6 0 therefore l has a quasi linear free resolution for all k m here we give an example to demonstrate the step recursively mentioned in the proof of above theorem example 3 7 let i a b cd ce de be a monomial ideal in the polynomial ring s k a b c d e therefore we have the following chain of ideals i 0 cd ce de i 1 a i 0 i 2 i the betti diagram of i 0 is given as 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 3 2 the betti diagram of i 1 can be obtained from i 0 changes in shift are shown in bold entries 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 2 3 5 3 2 2 2 0 the betti diagram of i 2 i can be obtained from i 1 changes in shift are shown in bold entries 0 1 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 2 3 8 3 5 7 5 2 2 2 0 one can notice the changes in the shifts by comparing the above betti diagrams it is clear from above that torsi i 1 k j tor s i i 0 k j tor s i 1 i 0 1 k j for i 0 and torsi i k j tor s i i 1 k j tor s i 1 i 1 1 k j for i 0 moreover tors 0 i 1 k j tor s 0 a k j tor s 0 i 0 k j and tors 0 i k j tor s 0 b k j tor s 0 i 1 k j for a pure monomial ideal i s of degree d we have i t is a monomial ideal generated by t degree monomials in i in particular i t i x 1 x 2 xn t d 4 theorem 3 8 let i s be a pure monomial ideal of degree d having quasi linear quotients with respect to the generating set g i u 1 u 2 um then i t will also have quasi linear quotients for t d proof we prove our claim by giving the an ordered generating set of i t i x 1 x 2 xn t d that admits quasi linear quotients we claim that i t have quasi linear quotients with respect to the following generating system v 1 u 1 v 1 u 2 v 1 um v 2 u 1 v 2 u 2 v 2 um vru 1 vru 2 vrum such that r n t d 1 n 1 we order the above list of generators in lexicographic order with respect to vi by ignoring the monomial uj one may observe that all the monomials in the above list are of type vi uj where vi is a monomial of degree t d 1 firstly observe that if u 1 um admits quasi linear quotients then xt d 1 u 1 x t d 1 u 2 x t d 1 um also admits the quasi linear quotients therefore all the colon lv 1 uk will have a linear term for all 1 k m now take any term from the list of monomials viuk for 2 i from the above list with the assumption that vi x p ix with deg x t d p and supp x xj j i then there exists a term vj x 1 x p 1 i x such that vi lex vj or equivalently i j therefore the colon ideal lviuk will have a linear term vjuk gcd viuk vjuk x 1 as required references 1 anwar i raza z
