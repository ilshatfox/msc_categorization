classi cation of second order linear ordinary di erential equations with rational coe cients p v bibikov 1 submitted by 1 institute of control sciences ras received abstract in the present work we study linear ordinary di erential equations of second order with rational coe cients such equations are very important in complex analysis for example they include the so called fuchs equations which appear in 21 hilbert s problem and in the theory of special functions bessel function gauss hypergeometric function etc we compute the symmetry group of this class of equations and it appears that this group includes non rational and even non algebraic transformations also the eld of di erential invariants is described and the e ective equivalence criterion is obtained finally we present some examples 2010 mathematical subject classi cation 34 m 03 14 h 50 53 a 55 keywords and phrases ordinary di erential equation linear equation di erential invariant jet space 1 introduction the class of second order linear di erential equations y a z y b z y 0 is one of the most important classes of odes which appears in many di erent areas of mathematics and physics for example such is the equation of the free oscillations of a spring pendulum with the friction force another famous example comes from complex analysis and describes the so called special functions see 11 19 25 airy function ai is the solution of the equation y zy 0 bessel function jt is the solution of the equation z 2 y zy z 2 t 2 y 0 hypergeometric function f a b c z is the solution of the equation z 1 z y c a b 1 y aby 0 in all these examples coe cient functions a and b are rational we may ask when two second order linear di erential equations with rational coe cients are equivalent with respect to the action of holomorphic di eomorphisms in variables z y the corresponding group of these di eomorphisms is called point pseudogroup let us make some historical remarks related to this question the problems of the classi cation of di erential equations were studied by s lie who introduced di erential geometry and geometric methods in the theory of di erential equations in particular s lie proved see 1 that each rst order di erential equation is point equivalent to the trivial equation y 0 in the neighborhood of regular point also he proved that each second order e mail tsdtp 4 u proc ru 2 bibikov di erential equation is contact equivalent to the trivial one y 0 in the neighborhood of regular point but the point classi cation of second order di erential equations is not trivial this problem was studied by many famous mathematicians such as s lie a tresse r liouville e cartan etc a tresse in 22 calculated the algebra of di erential sub invariants the so called di erential parameters further b kruglikov in 14 found the algebra of absolute di erential invariants and classi ed non degenerated second order di erential equations with respect to the action of point pseudogroup the most important class of equations which is not included in the tresse kruglikov classi cation is the class of equations cubic in the rst variable this class of odes includes for example painleve equations see 3 and equations associated with the projective connections see 9 and projective geometry see 16 20 these equations were also studied by many mathematicians r liouville found two tensor di erential invariants and obtained a criterion of trivialization i e point equivalence to the equation y 0 for such odes see 17 v arnold found the so called non dezarg di erential 5 2 form and studied the canonical forms of such odes see 2 nally v yumaguzhin calculated the algebra of scalar di erential invariants and found the criterion of point equivalence for two non degenerated odes see 21 24 another important case of second order odes is case of linear odes according to the result of e cartan see 9 all second order linear equations are point equivalent the study of the linear equations of higher order was very popular at the beginning of the xx th century because linear equations are closely connected with di erential projective geometry the most important results in this area belong to e wilczynski see 26 but all these results have one general aw they cannot be calculated with the help of the computer on the other hand if we consider the linear di erential equations with rational coe cients it is possible to apply di erent results from algebra and algebraic geometry such idea was used by v lychagin and p bibikov in series of works 5 7 related to the famous algebraic problem of classi cation of homogeneous forms another application of this idea to di erential equations was considered by p bibikov and a malakhov in 8 the present paper is a logical continuation of papers 4 8 we consider the class of linear second order odes with the rational coe cients over the complex eld c and study the action of the symmetry group on these equations in work 8 the corresponding group was a subgroup of plane cremona group cr 2 it appears that our group is larger and includes non rational holomorphic transformations nevertheless it is possible to give the global e ective classi cation of linear odes with respect to the action of this group first of all we calculate the eld of di erential invariants for this action and then using this eld we suggest an e ective criterion for the equivalence of two non degenerated linear di erential equations with rational coe cients finally we give some examples 2 symmetry group and its lie algebra let j 2 c be the k jet space of germs of holomorphic functions with canonical coordinates z y p q then each linear di erential equation can be represented as a surface in j 2 c de ned by equation q a z p b z y 0 1 this surface is an algebraic cone over base c it is well known that point transformations which preserve the class of linear equations have the following form z 7 z y 7 z y but the condition of rationality of coe cients a and b imposes additional restrictions on functions and first of all function should be rational then it is known see for example 10 that rational morphism z 7 z is birational if and only if it is projective so z z z where and are complex constants and 1 lobachevskii journal of mathematics classification of second order linear differential equations 3 now let us apply transformation z 7 z z y 7 z y to our equation 1 after such transformation the equation 1 transforms into the equation q 2 r z 2 z a z z 2 p r z r z 2 2 z r z a z r z z 2 b z z 4 y 0 2 where r z ln z and z z z hence our transformation preserves the class of linear odes with rational coe cients if and only if function r z ln z is rational then we get that z e r z dz where r z is a rational function we obtain the following result theorem 1 the symmetry group g of the linear second order di erential equations with rational coe cients consists of transformations z 7 z z y 7 e r z dzy where r is an arbitrary rational function the action of group g on coe cients a and b of the equation q ap by 0 is given by the formulas a z 7 2 r z 2 z a z z 2 b z 7 r z r z 2 2 z r z a z r z z 2 b z z 4 where z z z the corresponding lie algebra consists of vector elds x z 2 z z 2 a z 2 z 2 a a a z z 4 zb 2 b b 3 remark it is easy to describe the integrals r z dz in terms of elementary functions namely such integrals have the form u z lnv z where u and v are also rational hence despite the fact that the coe cients of our equations are rational the symmetry group includes non rational transformations of coordinates z and y 3 field of differential invariants in this section we study the eld of di erential invariants for the action of the symmetry group g on the space of pairs of rational functions a b first of all we recall necessary de nitions consider the arbitrary meromorphic map f c c 2 denote by jk the k jet space of such functions the canonical coordinates on this space are denoted by z a b a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 ak bk the action of the symmetry group g on the maps f c c 2 prolongs to the action on the k jet space jk for all k we denote the corresponding group acting on jk as g k also introduce the in nite jet j lim jk and the corresponding group g lim g k as projective limits a di erential invariant of order 6 k for the action of group g is a rational g k invariant function j on k jet space jk an invariant derivation is a derivation with rational coe cients on in nite jet space j which commutes with the action of group g using computer system maple we get the following proposition lobachevskii journal of mathematics 4 bibikov proposition 1 function j 1 2 a 1 a 2 4 b 3 4 a 31 3 a 2 8 b a 21 20 b 1 6 a 2 a 8 b 2 4 a 3 a 1 2 a 3 a 2 4 b 2 2 a 3 a 2 8 aa 2 b 8 a 3 16 b 2 b 5 a 2 2 b 1 2 and derivation 1 2 a 1 a 2 4 b d dz are invariant unfortunately derivation has an irrational coe cient it is not good because the coe cients of our equations are rational and it is natural to stay in the eld of rational functions moreover according to the kruglikov lychagin theorem see 15 the eld of di erential invariants is generated by rational di erential invariants and invariant derivations with rational coe cients so we will take invariant derivation j now we are ready to describe the eld of all di erential invariants theorem 2 the eld of di erential invariants for the action of the symmetry group g on the in nite jet space j is freely generated by di erential invariant j of the order 3 and invariant derivation proof we use the classical construction of isotropy algebras see also 4 8 consider the projection k k 1 j k jk 1 the jet sequence k where k jk and k k 1 k k 1 and the ber v k 1 of projection k k 1 over jet k 1 let us de ne the isotropy subalgebra g k 1 g k which consists of tangent vectors x k k 1 vanishing in jet k 1 g k 1 x k k 1 x k 1 k 1 0 the isotropy subalgebra g k 1 acts on the ber v k 1 the number of independent di erential invariants of pure order k equals the codimension of the regular orbit of this action let us compute all isotropy subalgebras with the help of computer system maple it follows from formula 3 that the vectors from isotropy subalgebra g k 1 depend on variables li i 0 where i 6 k 1 g 0 a 2 4 b 2 a 1 a 1 a 2 a 3 2 2 a b l 2 4 b a 1 a 1 a 2 3 b 1 b 1 g 1 2 l 0 a 2 4 b 2 a 1 a 2 a 3 l 0 4 abl 0 3 al 0 a 1 l 3 10 l 0 b 1 l 0 a 2 b 2 g k 1 lk 1 bk where k 3 the dimension of the ber v k 1 equals 2 hence there are no di erential invariants of order 6 2 and there is only one independent di erential invariant of pure order k 3 according to the corollary of the rosenlicht theorem see 23 di erential invariant j and its invariant derivatives rationally generate the eld of di erential invariants remark using the constructions from 5 it can be proved that the algebra of all di erential invariants which are polynomials in coordinates of jet space and denominator 2 a 1 a 2 4 b 1 is also generated by invariant j and derivation lobachevskii journal of mathematics classification of second order linear differential equations 5 4 classification now we consider the following question when are two linear second order di erential equations with rational coe cients g equivalent we are interested in a global and e ective criterion consider the pair of rational functions a b from the linear di erential equation y a z y b z y 0 and the invariants j and j 1 j assume that the restrictions of these invariants on the given pair are well de ned i e 2 a a 2 4 b 6 0 in denominators of j and then we can de ne the rational morphism a b c 1 c 2 a b z j a 4 z b 4 z j 1 a 4 z b 4 z the closure in zariski topology of the image im a b is an algebraic curve c a b de ned by the algebraic dependence d a b between j a 4 z b 4 z and j 1 a 4 z b 4 z c a b c 2 d a b 0 theorem 3 1 pairs of functions a b and a b are g equivalent if and only if c a b c a b 2 pairs of functions a b and a b are g equivalent if and only if d a b d a b remark note that this theorem is similar to the theorem in work 5 proof the direct statements of the theorem are obvious let us prove the inverse ones note that c a b c a b if and only if d a b d a b if d a b d a b d then there exist two points z 1 z 2 c such that a b z 1 a b z 2 hence the values of di erential invariants j and j 1 in 4 jets a 4 z 1 b 4 z 1 and a 4 z 2 b 4 z 2 coincide let us di erentiate the polynomial d by invariant derivation we get dj j 1 dj 1 j 2 0 where j 2 2 j as the degree of d is minimal then dj 1 6 0 and j 2 dj dj 1 j 1 then the values of the di erential invariant j 2 in 5 jets a 4 z 1 b 4 z 1 and a 4 z 2 b 4 z 2 also coincide in the same way we obtain that for each point z 1 from the open in zariski topology set from the base c 2 there exists a point z 2 c 2 such that the values of all basic di erential invariants jk kj in the in nite jets a z 1 b z 1 and a z 2 b z 2 coincide hence according to theorem 2 there exists an in nite jet g z 1 z 2 g such that g z 1 z 2 a z 1 b z 1 a z 2 b z 2 not let us prove that there exists an element g g such that g a b a b this relation can be considered as a system of equations on the unknown constants and function note that the constants can be found from the element g z 1 z 2 to nd function one should use the formula 2 2 ln z 2 z a z z 2 a z above we prove that the system of equations g a b a b is formally integrable in some open in the zariski topology subset of c 2 hence this system is integrable and has the solution g g lobachevskii journal of mathematics 6 bibikov 5 examples in this section we provide some examples of the curves c a b and dependencies d a b for di erent pairs a b let us describe the procedure for computing the polynomial d d a b we consider the restrictions j j a b and j 1 j 1 a b of basic di erential invariants j and j 1 on the pair of rational functions a b of the di erential equation y a z y b z y 0 then we consider the polynomials pol numer j denom j and pol 1 numer j 1 denom j 1 where numer and denom are the numerator and denominator of a given fraction then the irreducible factor of the resultant of polynomials pol and pol 1 with respect to variable z is our polynomial d 1 consider the equation y zy 0 whose solution is airy function ai the polynomial d in this case looks as follows d 5 36 3 the corresponding curve c is a simple cubic parabola see fig 1 figure 1 2 consider the bessel

that the j invariant is an isomorphism from the riemann surface h to the riemann sphere c where h is the upper half plane and is the modular group the picard fuchs equation see 13 is d 2 y dj 2 1 j dy dj 31 j 4 144 j 2 1 j 2 y 0 this equation can be cast into the form of the hypergeometric di erential equation it has two linearly independent solutions called the periods of elliptic functions the ratio of the two periods is equal to the period ratio which is the standard coordinate on the upper half plane unfortunately the coe cients of the polynomial d are very big some of them are more than 10200 so we just show the corresponding curve c fig 8 lobachevskii journal of mathematics 10 bibikov figure 8 lobachevskii journal of mathematics classification of second order linear differential equations 11 5 the gauss manin connection is a connection on a certain vector bundle over a base space s of a family of algebraic varieties vs the bers of the vector bundle are the de rham cohomology groups hkdr vs of the bers vs of the family it was introduced by manin see 18 for curves s and by grothendieck see 12 in higher dimensions we consider just one example of this connection let v x y z be the elliptic curve x 3 y 3 z 3 xyz 0 here is a free parameter describing the curve it is an element of the complex projective line thus the base space of the bundle is taken to be the projective line for a xed in the base space consider an element of the associated de rham cohomology group h 1 dr v each such element corresponds to a period of the elliptic curve the cohomology is two
