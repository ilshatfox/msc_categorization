applied fields such as population dynamics heat conduction in materials 1 with memory seepage flow in porous media autonomous mobile robots fluid dynamics traffic models electro magnetic aeronautics economics and so on see for instance see 1 4 the fractional partial differential systems have recently been proved to be valuable tools in the modeling of many phenomena in various fields of science and engineering such as diffusion process electrical science electrochemistry viscoelasticity control science electro magnetic theory etc see 5 on the other hand hilfer see 6 proposed a generalized riemann liouville fractional derivative for short the hilfer fractional derivative which includes the riemann liouville and caputo fractional derivatives furati et al see 7 considered an initial value problem for a class of nonlinear fractional differential equations involving the hilfer fractional derivative very recently gu and trujillo see 8 investigated a class of evolution equations involving the hilfer fractional derivatives by using mittag leffler functions see 9 11 mathematical control theory is one of the important concept in the study of steering the dynamical system from given initial state to any other final state or to neighborhood of the final state under some admissible control input the controllability problem for an evolution equation is also consist of driving the solution of the system to a prescribed final target state exactly or in some approximate way in a finite interval of time see 12 21 and references therein in section 2 we briefly recall some basic known results and lemmas concerning fractional calculus throughout this works in section 3 we shall study the existence and uniqueness of mild solution of hilfer fractional partial integro differential equations in section 4 we shall investigate the sufficient conditions for controllability of hilfer fractional partial integro differential equations 2 preliminaries in this section we briefly recall some basic known results definition 2 1 see 22 the fractional integral of order 0 with the lower limit zero 2 for a function f t is defined as i f t 1 t 0 f s t s 1 ds t 0 is the gamma function definition 2 2 see 23 24 the hilfer fractional derivative of order 0 1 0 1 is defined as d 0 f t i 1 d dt i 1 1 0 f t remark when 0 0 1 the hilfer fractional derivative corresponds to the classical riemann liouville fractional derivative d 0 0 f t d dt i 1 0 f t d 0 f t when 1 0 1 the hilfer fractional derivative corresponds to the classical caputo fractional derivative d 1 0 f t i 1 0 d dt f t ctd 0 f t throughout this work we set j 0 b where b 0 is constant the state function w t takes its value in the banach space e l 2 0 2 with norm and the control function u t takes its value in the banach space l 2 0 2 from e to e let y c j e w c j e limt 0 t 1 1 w x t exist and finite with norm y where w y supt j t 1 1 w x t evidently y is a banach space for x e we defined the two families of operators s t t 0 and p t t 0 by s t i 1 0 p t p t t 1 0 t t d where 1 n 1 n 1 1 n 0 0 1 is the function of wright type which satisfies 0 d 1 1 for 0 3 lemma 2 1 see 25 the operators s t t 0 and p t t 0 have the following properties i for any fixed t 0 the operators s t and p t are bounded linear operators p t x mt 1 x for x 0 2 s t x mt 1 1 1 x for x 0 2 ii s t t 0 and p t t 0 are strongly continuous iii p t t 0 is continuous in the uniform operator topology 3 existence and uniqueness of mild solution in this section we prove the existence and uniqueness for mild solution of nonlinear hilfer fractional partial integro differential equation in the following form d 0 w x t aw x t f t w x t t 0 g t s w x s s 0 h s w x d ds t j 0 b x 0 2 w 0 t w 2 t 0 t j i 1 1 0 w x 0 w 0 x

semigroup t t on e and there exists a constant m 0 such that t t m w t takes the value in banach space e the nonlinear operators f j e e h j j e e and g j j e e e are given definition 3 1 we say that w x t y mild solution of system 3 1 if it satisfies w x t s t w 0 t 0 p t s f s w x s ds t 0 p t s s 0 g s w x r d ds t j 0 b x 0 2 4 where 0 h w x d r to establish the results we assume the following hypotheses h 1 i for each t j the function f t e e is continuous and for each w e the function f w x j e is strongly measurable ii for each positive number r n there is positive function zr j r such that sup w r f t w x t zr t the function s t s 1 zr s l 1 0 b r and there exist a 0 such that limr inf t 0 t s 1 zr s ds r h 2 for each t s j j the function h t s e e is continues and for each w e the function h w x j j e is strongly measurable h 3 i for each t s v j j e e the function g t s e e e is continues and for each v e the function g v j j e strongly measurable ii for each positive number r n there is positive function hr j r such that sup w r t 0 g t s w x t s 0 h s w x d ds hr t limr inf t 0 t s 1 hr s ds r theorem 3 1 if hypotheses h 1 h 3 are satisfied then the system 3 1 has a unique mild solution in j provided that mb 1 1 1 proof we defined the operator k y y by kw x t s t w 0 x t 0 p t s f s w x s ds t 0 p t s s 0 g s w x r d ds let br w x t y w x 0 w 0 x w x t r 5 which is bounded and closed subset of y step 1 we will show that there exists r 0 such that kw x t br we claim that there exists a positive number r such that kbr br if this is not true then for each positive number r there exists a function w x t br and kw x t y r then 1 r 1 kwr x t and so 1 limr r 1 kwr x t y however lim r r 1 kwr x t y lim r r 1 sup t j t 1 1 s t w 0 x sup t j t 1 1 t 0 p t s f

1 hr s ds mb 1 1 1 a contradiction hence kbr br for some positive number r step 2 we prove that the operator k maps br into a compact subset of br let the set dr t kw t w br is precompact in e for all t j this is trivial for t 0 since dr 0 w 0 x let 0 t b be fixed for 0 t and arbitrary 0 k w t t 0 t s 1 1 1 s 1 t s w 0 x d ds t 0 t s 1 t t s f s w x s d ds 6 t 0 t s 1 t t s s 0 g s w x r d d ds t t

and for all 0 also for w x t br kw x t k w x t y sup t j t 1 1 t 0 t s 1 1 1 0 s 1 t s w 0 x d ds sup t j t 1 1 t t t s 1 1 1 s 1 t s w 0 x d ds sup t j t 1 1 t t t s 1 t t s f s w x s d ds sup t j t

there are precompact sets arbitrary close to the set dr t and so dr t is precompact in y step 3 we will show that the kwr kw w br is an equicontinuous family of functions let w br and t j such that 0 t b kw t kw y sup t j t 1 1 s s t w 0 x sup t j t 1 1 t 0 p s p t s f s w x s ds sup t j t 1 1 t p s f s w x s ds sup t j t 1 1 t 0 p s p t s s 0 g s w x r d ds sup t j t 1 1 t p s s 0 g s w x r d ds its clearly that the right hand side of the above inequality tends to zero as t the compactness of p t for t 0 implies the continuity in the uniform operator topology thus kbr is both equicontinuous and bounded by using arzela ascoli theorem kbr is precompact in y hence k is a completely continuous operator on y from the schauder fixed point theorem k has a fixed point in bk any fixed point of k is a mild solution of 3 1 on j satisfying kw x t w x t the proof is completed 8 4 controllability of system in this chapter we will establish a set of sufficient conditions for controllability of nonlinear hilfer fractional partial integro differential equation in the following form d 0 w x t aw x t f t w x t bu x t t 0 g t s w x s s 0 h s w x d ds t j 0 b x 0 2 w 0 t w 2 t 0 t j i 1 1 0 w x 0 w 0 x x 0 2 4 2 where d 0 w x t w x t f t w x t and g t s w x s s 0 h s w x d are de fined in the previous sections and the control function u t is in l 2 j u a banach space of admissible control functions where u l 2 0 2 with u as a banach space the symbol b stands for a bounded linear from u into e definition 4 1 we say w x t y is a mild solution of system 4 2 if it satisfies w x t s t w 0 t 0 p t s f s w x s ds t 0 p t s bu x s ds t 0 p t s s 0 g s w x r d ds x 0 2 t j definition 4 2 the system 4 2 is said to be controllable on interval j if for every w 0 w 1 y there exists a control u t l 2 j u such that the mild solution w x t of system 4 2 satisfies w b w 1 x where w 1 and b are the preassigned terminal state and time respectively to prove the result let us assume the following hypotheses h 4 the linear operator q from u into e defined by qw t 0 p b s bu x s ds has an inverse operator q 1 which takes values in l 2 j u ker q where the kernel space of q is defined by ker q w y qw 0 and b is bounded liner operator 9 theorem 4 1 if the hypotheses h 1 h 4 are satisfied then the system 4 1 is control lable on interval j provided that mb 1 1 mb q 1 b 1 mb 1 1 1 proof using assumption h 4 define the control u x t q 1 w 1 s b w 0 x b 0 p b s f s w x s s 0 g s w x r d ds t we defined the operator y y by w x t s t w 0 x t 0 p t s f s w x s ds t 0 p t s s 0 g s w x r d ds t

x s b w 0 x b 0 p b s f s w x s s 0 g s w x r d ds d w 1 x step 1 we will show that there exist r 0 such that w x t br if this is not true then there exists wr x t br such that wr x t y r for some t j x 0 2 then we have r wr x t y 10 sup t j t 1 1 s t w 0 x sup t j t 1 1 t 0 p t s f s w x s ds sup t j t 1 1 t 0 p t s s 0 g s w x r d ds sup t j t 1 1 t 0 p t q 1 b w 1 x s b w 0 x b 0 p b s f s w x s

1 mb 1 1 mb q 1 b 1 mb 1 1 11 which is contradiction therefore w x t br for some r 0 step 2 to prove that the operator maps br into a compact subset of br let the set dr t w t w br is precompact in y
