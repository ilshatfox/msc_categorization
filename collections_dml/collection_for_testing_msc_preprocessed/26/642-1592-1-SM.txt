derivative integral sumudu transform 1 introduction recent years have been marked by an enormous growth of the use of the fractional calculus and fractional systems in several applications and domains 8 13 16 the use of the mathematical tools theories and methods is required to solve such a system one of the key and important problem in systems and control theory 1 5 17 is to find the solution of a singular continuous time fractional linear system with regular pencil which is already studied in 4 6 11 instead of the existing methods 4 6 11 in this paper we are going to use the sumudu transform 2 18 to solve such a singular continuous time fractional linear system since the sumudu transform is considered as an alternative to the laplace transform and has many particular and interesting properties as for instance the preserving properties of the scale and unit 2 this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the basic definitions and properties used are recalled then in section 3 the application of sumudu transform to solve singular continuous time fractional linear system is proposed in section 4 academic and real examples are presented the obtained results are compared to the existing methods finally the last section summarizes and discusses the obtained results 2 mathematical background in this section we recall some interesting definitions and properties which will be used definition 1 6 the function defined by d x t 1 n t 0 x n t n 1 d x n dnx d n 1 is called the caputo fractional derivative integral of the function x t where n 1 n n n and refers to the standard gamma function e mail zineb kaisserli univ mosta dz e mail djillali bouagada univ mosta dz 2 kaisserli bouagada definition 2 2 18 let us consider the set of functions a x t m 1 2 0 x t me t j if t 1 j 0 the sumudu transform x v of the function x t is defined over the set of functions a by x v s x t v v 1 0 x t e t v dv v 1 2 2 theorem 1 9 the sumudu transform of the fractional derivative integral 1 for n 1 n n n has the form s d x t v v x v n k 1 vk 1 x k 1 t t t 0 3 where x v denotes the sumudu transform of the function x t some interesting properties of the sumudu transform are described in the following proposition proposition 1 2 9 18 letx 1 v andx 2 t be the sumudu transforms of the functions x 1 t and x 2 t respectively then for any a r and n 1 n n n we have 1 s ta a 1 v

a e rn n be real matrices with dete 0 and det e v a 6 0 then for any v c and n 1 n n n the laurent series on the neighborhood of is given by e v a 1 i i v i 4 where rg e deg v det e v a 1 represent the index of nilpotency of e v a and i are the fundamental matrices proposition 3 12 for any real matrix a rn n the fundamental matrices verify i 0 a i 0 i n 3 main results we denote by rm n the set of real matrices with m rows and n columns and by rm the set of real columns vectors let us consider the fractional continuous time systems of the form d ex t ax t bu t 5 y t cx t du t 6 where d is the caputo fractional derivative integral x t rn u t rm and y t rp are the state the input and the output vectors of the model respectively and e a rn n b rn m c rp n and d rp m lobachevskii journal of mathematics singular continuous time fractional linear system 3 the boundary conditions of the system 5 are given by x t 0 x 0 nevertheless the solution x t is impulse free which is equivalent to the following compatibility condi tions ex t 0 and vk i ex k t 0 exist for all i 1 0 k n 1 n n and v 1 2 u t is provided and u k t 0 0 for all 0 k n 1 assuming that dete 0 and the pencil of the pair e a of the system 5 is regular i e det e v a 6 0 7 for any v c hence the system 5 is called fractional continuous time singular system using the caputo fractional derivative integral 1 the system 5 becomes ed x t ax t bu t 8 the system 8 is also called singular implicit fractional dynamical system thus its solution is given by the following theorem which is one of the main results of this paper theorem 2 the solution of the singular implicit fractional dynamical system 8 is given by x t i 0 i 1 i 1 b t 0 t i 1 1 u d i 1 i d i 1 bu t n 1 k 0 edi k 1 t x k t 0 i 0 n 1 k 0 ie ti k i k 1 x k t 0

sumudu transform formulas 2 and 3 to the system 8 we obtain s ed x t v s ax t bu t v using x v and u v as the sumudu transforms of x t and u t respectively and the fact that both the pencil e a is regular formula 7 and the system 8 is singular and impulse free we get x v e v a 1 v bu v e n k 1 vk 1 x k 1 t 0 substituting the term e v a 1 by the one given by the expression 4 yields x v i i v i v

solve singular continuous time fractional linear system with regular pencil in this paper singular continuous time fractional linear systems with regular pencil have been solved using sumudu transform due to its interesting properties however the case where e is invertible dete 6 0 has been already studied using sumudu transform in 7 the obtained results are promising and encourage us to extend and to use this approach for other type of system and circuit and also for other applications as for example the crone suspension which is one of our future research topics references 1 d baleanu j a t
