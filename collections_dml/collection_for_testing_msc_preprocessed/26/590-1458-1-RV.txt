fractional differential equation fractional differential operator monotonous sequences mixed solutions ams mathematics subject classification 26 a 33 1 introduction the fractional calculus is an active field of mathematical sciences and recently become famous since it is considered to extend the classical calculus and has wide range of applications almost all areas it follows the traditional definition of derivatives and integrals of calculus in form fractional order see 4 1 2 thus to use fractional order differential operator in mathematical modeling has become more and more popular and important because of their common occurrence in diverse applications in economics biology physics and engineering recently many researcher make the use of fractional differential and integral equations and contributed to the current literature by applying to solve the nonlinear differential equations of fractional order 3 it is considered that the class of fractional order differential equations is a generalization of the class of ordinary differential equations we discuss that the fractional order differential equations are more appropriate than the ordinary in mathematical modeling of biological studies as well as economics and social systems see 4 5 6 further the fractional calculus is utilized in biology and medicine to explore the potential of fractional differential equations to describe and to develop a structure and study functional properties of population as well as try to understand the growth of biological organisms of course it is an hope to extend this concept to evaluate the changes which are associated with the disease that contribute to the understanding of the pathogenic processes of medicine see 7 and to employ to the bacteria and other microbes to making something useful such as genetically engineered human insulin 4 among the fractional differential equations the hybrid type are important classes and deal with spe cial case of dynamical systems 8 9 in the related development dhage lakshmikantham and jadhav proved some of the major outcomes of hybrid linear differential equations of the first order and second type disturbances 10 11 12 however there were many open applied problems such 1 as to develop a mathematical model for bacteria growth by using the iterative difference equations in this regard ibrahim 13 established the existence of solutions for an iterative fractional differential equation cauchy type by using the technique of nonexpansive operator and similar problems were considered in the same direction as in the 14 15 16 17 in this work we discuss a mathematical model of biological experiments and its influence in our daily life the most prominent influence of biological organisms that effect negative or positive in our lives the bacteria the fractional hybrid iterative differential equations are more appropriate to observe and to develop a model our technique is based on the dhage fixed point theorem this tool describes mixed solutions by monotone iterative technique in the nonlinear analysis this method is used to combine two solutions lower and upper it is shown an approximate result for the hybrid fractional differential equations iterative in the closed assembly formed by the lower and upper solutions 2 preliminaries next we recall the following definitions that will be used in the development of the study definition 2 1 the derivative of fractional order for the function s where 0 1 is introduced by d a s d ds s a s s d d ds i 1 a s 1 1 in which is a whole number and is real number definition 2 2 the integral of fractional order for the function s where 0 is introduced by i a s s a s 1 d 2 in particular if a 0 then it becomes i a s s s where denotes the convolution product s s 1 and s 0 s 0 and s as 0 wherever s is the delta function based on the riemann liouville differential operator we have the following useful definitions definition 2 3 assume i s 0 s 0 a is a closed period bounded interval in where the real line for some s 0 a then the problem of initial value of fractional iterative hybrid differential equations fihde can be formulated as d v s s v s v v s s v s v v s s i 3 with v s 0 v 0 where i are continuous then a solution v c i of the fihde 3 can be given as 1 the map s v s v v v is a continuous function v and 2 v is the contented equations in 3 where c i is the space of real valued continuous functions defined on i 2 the definitions of the lower and upper solutions of 3 given as follows definition 2 4 the function c i is said to be a lower solution for the equation which introduced by 3 on i if satisfy 1 the map s 7 s s s s is continuous and 2 d s s v s v v s s s s s i s 0 v 0 definition 2 5 the function c i r is called an upper solution for the equation 3 on i if satisfies 1 the s 7 s s s s is continuous and 2 d s s v s v v s s s s s i s 0 v 0 we can build the monotonous sequence of consecutive iterations to converging towards the extremes among the lower and upper solutions of the differential equation related hybrid on i we treat the case that if is neither non decreasing nor non increasing in the state of the variable v then if the function can be separated into two components as s v v v 1 s v v v 2 s v v v where 1 s v v v is a non decreasing component while the another component is not 2 s v v v increasing in the state variables of v then we may be constructed sequences iteration converged to solutions extremal fihde 3 on i definition 2 6 currently thought to be a initial value problem fihde d v s s v s v v s 1 s v v v 2 s v v v s i v s 0 v 0 4 where c i r r and 1 2 l i r r thus the lower and upper solutions of 4 can be as defined as follows definition 2 7 the functions c i fulfill the following condition the maps s s s s s and s s s s s are absolute continuous on i thus the functions are supposed to be of the kind a which is mixed lower solutions and upper solutions for 4 on i as following d s s s s 1 s s 2 s s s s i s 0 v 0 5 and d s s s s 1 s s 2 s s s s i s 0 v 0 6 if the equality is achieved in 5 and 6 then the pair of functions is called a mixed solution of kind a for the fihde 4 on i b which is mixed lower solutions and upper for 4 on i as follows d s s s s 1 s s 2 s s s s i s 0 v 0 7 3 and d s s s s 1 s s 2 s s s s i s 0 v 0 8 if the equality is held in relations 7 and 8 then the pair of functions is called a mixed solution of kind b for 4 on i 2 1 assumptions in the following assumptions the function is very important in the study of eq 4 a 0 the function v 7 v s 0 v v v is injective in b 0 is a bounded real valued function on i a 1 the function v 7 v s v v v is increasing in for all s i a 2 there is a constant 0 so that s v v v s z z z v z m v z m 0 s i v z and m b 1 there exists a constant 0 such that s v v v s i and v b 2 1 s v v v is a non decreasing in v and 2 s v v v is not increasing in v for each s i b 3 0 0 is functions which are mixing the lower and upper solutions for 4 kind a on i with 0 0 b 4 the pair is 0 0 the upper and lower mixing solutions for 4 kinds b on i with 0 0 3 main results in this section our purpose is to discuss the approximate solution of 4 lemma 3 1 9 suppose the assumptions a 0 b 0 are achieved then the function v is a solution for eq 3 if and only if it must be the solution of the fractional iterative of hybrid equation integrated fihie v t v 0 s 0 v 0 v v 0 s v s v v s s 0 v v v s 1 d 9 s i v 0 v 0 theorem 3 1 18 let be a closed convex and bounded subset of the banach space a moreover let q a a and p a be two operators so that i q is nonlinear d contraction 4 ii p is compact and continuous iii v qv pz for all v z theorem 3 2 let the assumptions a 1 a 2 and b 1 be hold then 3 has a solution on i proof let a c i be a set and a such that v a a m 10 where m v 0 s 0 v 0 v v 0 0 a 1 1 and 0 sups i s 0 0 obviously is a convex bounded and closed subset of the space a by using the assumptions a 1 and b 1 together with the help of the lemma 3 1 we conclude that the fihde 3 is tantamount to the nonlinear fihie 9 we define two operators q a a and p a as follows qy s s v s v v s s i 11 and pv s v 0 s 0 v 0 v v 0 s 0 v v v s 1 d s i 12 consequently the fihie 9 is equivalent to the operator equation qv s pv s v s s i 13 we demonstrate that the operators q and p fulfill all the conditions of theorem 3 1 foremost we examine that q is a nonlinear contraction on q with a function let v z a in view of assumption a 2 we conclude that qv s qz s s v s s z s v s z s m v s z s v z m v z for all s i take the supremum over s yields av az v z m v z v z a this proves that q is a nonlinear d contraction a with the d function defined by r r m r next we examine that p is a continuous and compact operator on into a let vt be a sequence in converging to a point v thus we have lim t pvt s lim t v 0 s 0 v 0 v v 0 s 0 vt vt vt s 1 d v 0 s 0 y 0 v v 0 lim t s 0 vt vt vt s 1 d v 0 s 0 v 0 v v 0 s 0 lim t vt vt vt s 1 d v 0 s 0 v 0 v v 0 s 0 v v v s 1 d pv s 5 for all s i now we proceed to prove that pvt is equi continuous with respect to v according to 19 we attain that p is a continuous operator on to show that p is a compact operator on it suffices to examine that is a regularly bounded and equi continuous set in a let v be arbitrary then by the assumption b 1 we have pv s v 0 s 0 v 0 v v 0 s 0 v v v s 1 d v 0 s 0 v 0 v v 0 s 0 s 1 d v 0 s 0 v 0 v v 0 a 1 1 for all s i by taking the supremum over t we obtain pv s v 0 s 0 v 0 v v 0 a 1 1 v this proves that p is uniformly bounded on also let s 1 s 2 i with s 1 s 2 then for any v one has pv s 1 pv s 2 s 1 s 0 v v v s 1 1 d s 2 s 0 v v v s 2 1 d s 1 s 0 v v v s 1 1 d s 1 s 0 v v v s 2 1 d s 1 so v v v s 2 1 d s 2 s 0 v v v s 2 1 d 1 1 s 2 s 2 s 1 s 0 s 2 s 1 s 2 s 1 hence for 0 there exists a 0 so that s 1 s 2 pv s 1 pv s 2 s 1 s 2 i and v this examines for p is equi continuous in a presently p is bounded and hence it is compact by arzel ascoli theorem resulting is a continuous and compact operator on then we prove that assumptions iii of theorem 3 1 is fulfilled let v a be fixed and z be arbitrary such that v qv pz in view of the assumption a 2 yields v s qv s pz s v 0 s 0 v 0 s v s v v s s 0 v v v s 1 d v 0 s 0 v 0 s v s v v s s 0 v v v s 1 d v 0 s 0 v 0 v v 0 0 s 0 s 1 d v 0 s 0 v 0 v v 0 0 a 1 1 taking the supremum over s implies that v v 0 s 0 v 0 v v 0 0 a 1 1 m 6 thus v therefore fulfilled all conditions of the theorem 3 1 and thus the operator equation v qv pz has a solution in resulting the fihde 3 has a solution introduced on i this completes the proof theorem 3 3 let c i be lower and upper solutions of fihde 3 fulfilling s s s i and let the assumptions a 1 a 2 and b 1 achieved then there is a solution v s of 3 in the closed set f satisfying s v s s s i proof assume that i 7 is a function defined by s v v v max s min v s s satisfying s v v v s s v v v moreover define a continuous extension of on i such that s v v v u s v v v s i v in view of theorem 3 2 the fihde d v s s v s v v s s v v v s i v u 0 v 0 14 has a solution v defined on i for any 0 define s s s s s s s 1 s 15 and s s s s s s s 1 s 16 for s i in virtue of the assumptions a 1 we get s s and s s 17 for s i since s 0 v 0 s 0 one has s 0 v 0 s 0 18 to show that s v 0 s s i 19 we define v s v s s v s v v s s i likewise we consider s s s s s u s s s 7 and t s s s s s t s s s s s s i if eq 19 is wrong then there exists a s s 0 s 0 a such that v s and s v s s s 0 s s if v s s then s v s v v s s furthermore s s v s v v s s now d t s s s s s v s v v s d v s s i since t us d t s s i we have d t s d v s 20 but v s t s also v s t s s 0 s s means that together v s v s t s t s if 0 a small take the limit 0 in the up variance yields d v s d t s that is a contradiction to 20 hence v s s s i consequently s v s s s i letting 0 in the up inequality we get s v s s s i this completes the proof theorem 3 4 let assumptions a 1 a 2 and b 2 b 3 achieved then there are the monotonous sequences t t such that t and t uniformly on i in which are mixed extremal solutions fihde 4 type a on i proof note the following a quadratic fihde d t 1 s s t 1 s t 1 s 1 s t s t s 2 s t s t s s i t 1 s 0 v 0 21 8 and d t 1 s s t 1 s t 1 s 1 s t s t s 2 s t s t s s i t 1 s 0 v 0 22 for t n obviously the equations 21 and 22 having unique solutions t 1 and t 1 on i respectively given banach contraction mapping principle we now want to demonstrate that 0 1 2 t t 2 1 0 23 on i for t 0 1 2 let t 0 and set s s s s 0 s s 0 s 0 s 1 s s 1 s 1 s for s i next by monotonicity of 1 and 2 we get d s s s s d 0 s s 0 s 0 s d 1 s s 1 s 1 s 1 s 0 0 s 0 s 2 s 0 s 0 s 1 s 0 0 s 0 s 2 s 0 s 0 s 0 s i and s 0 0 this implies that 0 s s 0 s 0 s 1 s s 1 s 1 s s i in view of a 1 one can get 0 s 1 s s i likewise it can be demonstrated which 1 s 0 s on i setting s s s s 1 s s 1 s 1 s 1 s s 1 s 1 s s i by monotonicity of 1 and 2 we obtain d s s s s d 1 s s 1 s 1 s d 1 s s 1 s 1 s 1 s 0 0 s 0 s 2 s 0 s 0 s 1 s 0 0 s 0 s 2 s 0 s 0 s 0 s i and s 0 0 this leads to 1 s s 1 s 1 s 1 s s 1 s 1 s s i by a 1 we attain to 1 s 1 s s i next for n yields 1 1 and hence 1 1 setting s s s s s s s s 1 s s 1 s 1 s then the humdrum of 1 and 2 we receive 9 d s s s s d s s s s d 1 s s 1 s 1 s 1 s 1 1 s 2 s 1 1 1 s 2 s 0 s i and s 0 0 this implies that s s s 1 s s 1 s 1 s for every s i since assumption a 1 achieved we have s 1 s s i likewise it can be demonstrated which 1 s s on i the same way it is assumed that the inequality 1 1 achieves on i we are going to demonstrate that 1 1 on i set s s s s 1 s s 1 s 1 s 1 s s 1 1 for s i so by monotonicity of 1 and 2 we get d s s s s d 1 s s 1 s 1 s d 1 s s 1 1 1 s s s 2 s s s 1 s 1 1 2 s s s 0 for the whole s i and s 0 0 this means that 1 s s 1 s 1 s 1 s 1 1 for every s i since assumption a 1 is achieved we have 1 s 1 s s i up to now it is shown that the sequences and are bounded uniformly and equi continuous sequences and therefore converge uniformly on i as they are monotonous sequences t and t the converse uniformly monotonous and on i respectively thus the pair is a mixed solution of these equations 4 on i lastly we can establish which is a mixed solution of minimum and maximum for the equations 4 on i let v whatever solution of the equations 4 on i as 0 s v s s oni assume that for n s v s s s i we will demonstrate which 1 s v s 1 s s i adjustment s s s s 1 s s 1 s 1 s v s s v s v v s for every s i after for the monotony of 1 and 2 we get d s s s s d 1 s s 1 s 1 s d v s s v s v v s 1 s s s 2 s s s 1 s v s v v s 2 s v s v v s 0 for the whole s i and s 0 0 this yields 1 s s 1 s 1 s v s s v s v v s 10 for every s i since assumption a 1 is valid we get 1 s v s s i likewise it can be demonstrated which v s 1 s on i in principle the method of induction t v t for every s i by taking t limit we get v on i so they are mixed type a extreme solutions for the equations 4 on i i e d s s s s 1 s s s 1 s s s s i s 0 v 0 24 and d s s s s 1 s s s 1 s s s s i s 0 v 0 25 the proof is completed corollary 3 1 suppose the hypothesis of theorem 3 4 are fulfilled assume that for 1 2 1 2 f then 1 s 1 s 1 s 1 s 2 s 2 s n 1 1 s s 1 s 1 s 2 s s 2 s 2 s n 1 0 and 2 s 1 s 1 s 2 s 2 s 2 s n 2 1 s s 1 s 1 s 2 s s 2 s 2 s n 2 0 thus s v s s on i proof for on i it suffices to demonstrate that on i introduce a function c i s s s s s s s s s s s s next s 0 0 and d s s s s d s s s s d s s s s 1 s s s 1 s s s 2 s s s 2 s s s n 1 s s s s s s s s n 2 s s s s s s s s n 1 n 2 s s s s this demonstrates that s s s s 0 on i demonstrating that on i therefore v i the proof is completed theorem 3 5 let us suppose that the assumption a 1 a 2 and b 2 b 4 achieved therefore for any solution v s of 4 with 0 v 0 and we are an iteration t t satisfactory for s i 0 2 2 t v 2 t 1 3 1 1 3 2 t 1 v 2 t 2 0 26 as long as 0 2 and 2 0 on i in which iterating is given by d 2 t 1 s s 2 t 1 s 2 t 1 s 1 s t s t s 2 s t s t s s i 2 t 1 s 0 vo 27 11 and d 2 t 1 s s 2 t 1 s 2 t 1 s 1 s t s t s 2 s t s t s s i 2 t 1 s 0 vo 28 of t n furthermore the monotonous sequences 2 t 2 t 1 2 t 2 t 1 converge uniformly to respectively and fulfilling this assumptions 1 d s s s s 1 s s s 2 s s s 2 d s s s s 1 s t s s 2 s s s 3 d s s s s 1 s s s 2 s s s 4 d s s s s 1 s s s 2 s s s for s i and v v s i 0 0 0 0 v 0 proof by the assumptions of the theorem we suppose that 0 2 and 2 0 on i we demonstrate that 0 2 v 3 1 1 3 v 2 0 29 on i set s s s s v s s v s v v s 1 s s 1 s 1 s utilization that 0 v 0 on i as v is any solution of 4 and the monotonous the nature of functions 1 and 2 this yields d s s s s d v s s v s v v s d 1 s s 1 s 1 s 1 s v s v v s 2 s v s v v s 1 s 0 s 0 s 2 s 0 s 0 s 0 for every s i and s 0 0 thus we reached the conclusion v s s v s v v s 1 s s 1 s 1 s or v s 1 s for every s i in the same way we can show that 3 1 1 v and 2 v taking into account differences s s s s
