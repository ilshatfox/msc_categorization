integral 1 introduction let f a b r be a differentiable mapping on a b whose derivative f a b r is bounded on a b i e f sup t a b f t then we have the inequality f x 1 b a b a f t dt 1 4 x a b 2 2 b a 2 b a f 1 for all x a b 16 the constant 1 4 is the best possible this inequality is well known in the literature as the ostrowski inequality definition 1 let p a x 0 x 1 xn b be any partition of a b and let f xi f xi 1 f xi then f x is said to be of bounded variation if the sum m i 1 f xi is bounded for all such partitions let f be of bounded variation on a b and p denotes the sum n i 1 f xi corresponding to the partition p of a b the number b a f sup p p p a b is called the total variation of f on a b here p a b denotes the family of partitions of a b in 9 dragomir proved following

xi and v h max hi i 0 1 n 1 and let intermediate points i xi xi 1 i 0 1 n 1 then we have b a f t dt a f in r f in 3 where a f in n i 0 f i hi 4 and the remainder term satisfies r f in 1 2 v h max i 0

21 the aim of this paper is to obtain a new generalization of ostrowski type integral inequalities for functions of bounded variation and we give some applications for our results 2 main results

generalization of ostrowski type inequalities 3 where 0 1 and d c f denotes the total variation of f on c d proof define the mapping k x t by k x t t a x a 2 a t x t b b x 2 x t b integrating by parts we get b a k x t df t x a t a x a 2 df t b x t b b x 2 df t t a x a 2 f t x a x a f t dt t b b x 2 f t b x b x f t dt x a 1 2 f x x a 2 f a b x 2 f b b x 1 2 f x b a f t dt b a 1 2 f x x a f a b x f b 2 b a f t dt it is well known that if g f a b r are such that g is continuous on a b and f is of bounded variation on a b then b a g t df t exist and b a g t df t supt a b g t b a f 7 on the other hand using 7 we get b a k x t df t x a t a x a 2 df t b x t b b x 2 df t sup t a x t a x a 2 x a f sup t x b t b b x 2 b x f x a 1 2 x a f b x 1 2 b x f 1 2 max x a b x b a f 1 2 b a 2 x a b 2 b a f this completes the proof lobachevskii journal of mathematics 4 budak and sarikaya remark 1 if we choose 0 in theorem 3 then the inequality 7 reduces the inequality 2 corollary 1 under the assumption of theorem 3 with 1 then we have the following inequality 12 b a f x x a f a b x f b 2 b a f t dt 12 b a 2 x a b 2 b a f 8 remark 2 if we take x a b 2 in corollary 1 then we have the inequality b a 2 f a b 2 f a f b 2 b a f t dt 14 b a b a f which was given by alomari in 3 the constant 1 4 is the best possible corollary 2 under the assumption of theorem 3 with 2 3 then we get the inequality 23 b a f x x a f a b x f b 3 b a f t dt 23 b a 2 x a b 2 b a f 9 remark 3 if we take x a b 2 in corollary 2 then we have the simpson s inequality b a 3 f a f b 2 2 f a b 2 b a f t dt 13 b a b a f which was given by dragomir in 7 corollary 3 under the assumption of theorem 3 suppose that f c 1 a b then we have b a 1 2 f x x a f a b x f b 2 b a f t dt 1 2 b a 2 x a b 2 f 1 for all x a b here as subsequently 1 is the l 1 norm f 1 b a f t dt corollary 4 under the assumption of theorem 3 let f a b r be a lipschitzian with the constant l 0 then for all x a b b a 1 2 f x x a f a b x f b 2 b a f t

a b then for all x a b b a 1 2 f x x a f a b x f b 2 b a f t dt 1 2 b a 2 x a b 2 f b f a 3 application to quadrature formula we now introduce the intermediate points i xi xi 1 i 0 1 n 1 in the division in a x 0 x 1 xn b let hi xi 1 xi and v h max hi i 0 1 n 1 and define the sum a f in n i 0 1 2 f i hi i xi f xi xi 1 i f xi 1 2 10 then the following theorem holds theorem 4 let f be as theorem 3 then b a f t dt a f in r f in 11 where a f in is defined as above and the remainder term r f in satisfies r f in 1 2 1 2 v h max i 0 1 n 1 i xi xi 12 b a f 1 2 v h b a f proof application of theorem 3 to the interval xi xi 1 i 0 1 n 1 gives 12 1 2 f i hi i xi f xi xi 1 i f xi 1 2 xi 1 xi f t dt 1 2 hi 2 i xi xi 12 xi 1 xi f for all i 0 1 n 1 summing the inequality 12 over i from 0 to n 1 and using the generalized triangle inequality we have r f in 1 2 n i 0 hi 2 i xi xi 12 xi 1 xi f 1 2 max i 0 1 n 1 hi 2 i xi xi 12 n i 0 xi 1 xi f 1 2 1 2 v h max i 0 1 n 1 i xi xi 12 b a f which completes the proof of the first inequality in 4 lobachevskii journal of mathematics 6 budak and sarikaya for the second inequality in 4 we show that i xi xi 12 hi 2 i 0 1 n 1 and maxi 0 1 n 1 i xi xi 12 12 v h which completes the proof remark 4 if we choose 0 we get 3 with 4 and 5 remark 5 if we choose 2 3 and i xi xi 1 2 then we have b a f t dt as f in rs f in where as f in 1 6 n i 0 f xi f xi 1 hi 2 3 n i 0 f xi xi 1 2 hi and the remainder term rs f in satisfies rs f in 1 3 v h b a f which were given by dragomir in 7 corollary 6 choosing 1 gives b a f t dt a f in r f in where a f in n i 0 1 2 f i hi i xi f xi xi 1 i f xi 1 2 and the remainder term r f in satisfies r f in 1 2 1 2 v h max i 0 1 n 1 i xi xi 12 b a f 1 2 v h b a f particularly if we take i xi xi 1 2 then we have a f in 1 2 n i 0 f xi xi 1 2 f xi f xi 1 2 hi and r f in 1 4 v h b a f corollary 7 let f a b r be a lipschitzian with the constant l 0 then we have 10 and 11 and the remainder term satisfies r f in l 1 2 1 2 v h
