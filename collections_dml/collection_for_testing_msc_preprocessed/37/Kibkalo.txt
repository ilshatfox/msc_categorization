by i v komarov which is a generalization of the kovalevskaya integrable case in rigid body dynamics we generalize some results by a v bolsinov p h richter and a t fomenko about the topology of the classical kovalevskaya case we also show how the fomenko zieschang invariant can be calculated for every admissible curve in the image of the momentum map 2010 mathematical subject classification 37 j

showed that the kovalevskaya integrable case in rigid body dynamics can be included in a one parameter family of integrable hamiltonian systems on the pencil of lie algebras so 3 1 e 3 so 4 the kovalevskaya top was realized as a system on lie algebra e 3 we will briefly describe this construction consider the six dimensional space r 6 j x and the following one parameter family of poisson brackets depending on the real parameter ji jj ijkjk ji xj ijkxk xi xj ijkjk where ijk sign 123 ijk when 0 0 and 0 this bracket coincides with the lie poisson bracket for the lie algebras so 4 e 3 and so 3 1 respectively these brackets have two casimir functions f 1 x 2 1 x 2 2 x 2 3 j 2 1 j 2 2 j 2 3 f 2 x 1 j 1 x 2 j 2 x 3 j 3 in the case of 0 a 0 the common level surfaces of the casimir m 4 a b j x f 1 j x a f 2 j x b are orbits of the coadjoint representation and symplectic leaves the hamiltonian h of the system and the integral k are equal to h j 21 j 2 2 2 j 2 3 2 c 1 x 1 k j 2 1 j 2 2 2

foliation defined by the momentum mapping f h k m 4 a b r 2 on every non singular orbit m 4 a b bifurcation diagrams a b of f are often denoted by e mail slava kibkalo gmail com 2 kibkalo for short they were constructed by m kharlamov 8 when 0 and by i kozlov 3 when 0 they consist of the smooth fragments of curves called arcs and the points of their tangency intersection or cusps called singular points some families of arcs and singular points have analogs in the case of 0 these old families are denoted by y 1 y 13 and 1 2 in 3 and 2 respectively families of singular points that have no such analogs are denoted by z 1 z 11 in 3 we establish five families i i 1 5 of such new arcs table 1 contains necessary information about new arcs of and families of liouville tori denoted by 1 5 in 2

by a t fomenko and his school and discussed in 1 marked molecule is an invariant that classifies liouville foliations on three dimensional manifolds one should know some special coordinate basic cycles on the boundary tori of the neighborhoods of the critical fibers to calculate this invariant such bases are called admissible coordinate systems the definition of admissible coordinate systems for all types of the 3 atoms was given in 1 a v bolsinov p h richter and a t fomenko proved in 2 that for the kovalevskaya top the admissible coordinate systems near of every arc of a b can be expressed via the uniquely defined cycles the following theorem states that this result remains true for the case of so 4 theorem 1 the following coordinate systems i i are the admissible coordinate systems for the arcs i i 1 5 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 3 2 2 0 1 1 0 2 2 3 3 0 1 1 0 1 1 4 4 1 1 1 0 4 3 5 5 0 1 1 0 3 1 proof calculation of admissible coordinate systems for all i i 1 5 is based on well known facts about the structure of liouville foliation in neighborhoods of nondegenerate zero rank critical points the label r is equal to infinity for a point of the centre saddle type and therefore the cycles for the corresponding arcs are equal up to a sign we also use theorem 2 proved later about the admissible coordinate system for a critical point of centre centre type let us show the calculation for the arc 1 the arcs 3 4 5 can be considered analogously since z 5 is the image of a centre saddle point we have 1 2 3 1 the point z 1 is a critical point of centre centre type hence we choose the negative sign and 1 1 we consider the point z 3 to calculate cycles for the arc 2 this critical point has the centre saddle type hence we can take 2 2 and 2 2 where 1 since z 2 is the image of a degenerate critical orbit of rank 1 we need that 2 2 and 1 because both cycles are determined by sgradh lobachevskii journal of mathematics analysis of kovalevskaya case on so 4 3 a smooth curve without self intersections in r 2 is called admissible if it intersects the arcs of bifurcation diagram transversely and does not pass through the singular points of remark 1 admissible coordinate systems for arcs 1 2 found in 2 and the results of our theorem are sufficient to compute the marked molecule of every admissible curve for the kovalevskaya system on so 4 2 theorem about a point of centre centre type in this section we describe the marked loop molecule for the f image of a critical point of centre centre type the loop molecule has the form a a the label r 0 and the label 1 so one should calculate this sign small neighborhood of this point has the structure of cartesian product of two 2 atoms of the type a the formal definition of such point can be found in 1 its image will be called a singular point of centre centre type for every arc of bifurcation diagram we consider a small vertical interval i on the straight line h const that intersects this arc transversely the preimage of such interval is also the 3 atom a recall that it is a solid torus s 1 d 2 foliated by liouville tori and one singular elliptic orbit and the 2 atom a is its base definition 1 basis of 1 t 2 on the boundary torus is called admissible iff 1 the cycle is contractible 2 the orientation of the cycle is determined by the hamiltonian vector field sgradh on the singular fibre 3 basis in 1 t 2 is positive on the boundary torus we assume that basis u v in txt 2 is positive if the quadruple of vectors gradh n u v is positive w r t the volume form here n is the outward pointing normal vector to the 3 atom it is important that this way allows to determine the admissible coordinate systems near all arcs simultaneously as it was made in 2 it means that every gluing 2 2 matrix can be calculated as the transition matrix from the basis of the first arc to the basis near the other arc in particular determinants of all gluing matrices for the isoenergy surfaces h const are equal to 1 if we consider a surface under the condition k const then the determinants of all gluing matrices are equal to 1 the bifurcation diagram is an angle near the singular point l under consideration we consider inward pointing tangent vectors to arcs 1 2 of that intersect in l let the derivation of h in the direction of a tangent vector be called the derivation of h in the direction of the corresponding arc theorem 2 let point l be a singular point of a bifurcation diagram of centre centre type let i 1 i 1 2 be the signs of the derivatives of h in the direction of the intersecting arcs i i 1 2 respectively admissible coordinate systems i i for these arcs can be chosen s t 2 2 0 1 2 0 1 1 proof 1 it is well known that there exist local coordinates p 1 p 2 q 1 q 2 such that the symplectic form is given by the following formula in a neighborhood of this critical point of centre centre type dp 1 dq 1 dp 2 dq 2 and the functions h k have the form h h 1 2 k k 1 2 in this neighborhood where 1 p 2 1 q 2 1 and 2 p 2 2 q 2 2 we assume that i 0 on the arc i i 1 2 liouville tori near the critical point of centre centre type are the cartesian product of two circles 1 2 with tangent vector fields u 1 u 2 lobachevskii journal of mathematics 4 kibkalo u 1 q 1 0 p 1 0 u 2 0 q 2 0 p 2 2 we claim that i i for the arcs i have the following form 1 1 1 sgn h 1 2 2 2 2 sgn h 2 1 3 let us denote tangent vector fields to the cycles 1 2 as v 1 v 2 v 1 h 1 u 2 v 2 h 2 u 1 the orientations of cycles i are determined by the vector field sgradh sgradh 1 dh 2 q 1 h 1 2 q 2 h 2 2 p 1 h 1 2 p 2 h 2 to check the orientation of the cycles we have to verify that two quadruples of vectors gradh ni ui vi i 1 2 are positive w r t the volume form here ni is the outward pointing normal vector to the isoenergy 3 atom a for the arc i i 1 2 it can be easily checked that n 1 sgn h 2 n n 2 sgn h 1 n where vector n is the orthogonal to gradh ui vi n p 1 2 h 2 p 2 1 h 1 q 1 2 h 2 q 2 1 h 1 corollary 1 all elements of the gluing matrix in theorem 2 change their signs if one change the required orientation of the quadruple of vector fields in the definition of admissible coordinate system we assume that the critical point of centre centre is the only point in the fibre general case can be reduced to this one by considering the appropriate leaf of the bifurcation complex a t fomenko suggested the concept of bifurcation complex for systems of different dimensions in 5 and 6 their properties also were described there some applications and links between it and other topological
