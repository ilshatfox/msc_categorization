space over algebraically closed fields and r the list of all two dimensional left right unital power associative algebras along with their unit elements is specified also we compare the result of the paper with that results obtained earlier 2010 mathematical subject classification 15 a 03 15 a 24 17 a 60 17 a 05 keywords and phrases power associative algebra isomorphism classification unital algebra 1 introduction the class of power associative algebras is big enough to contain such classes of well known algebras as associative lie commutative jordan and alternative in the last two cases it is assumed that the underlying field is of characteristic 0 in this paper we use results from 1 6 7 11 18 19 to describe all power associative algebra structures on a two dimensional vector space over algebraically closed fields and r by providing the lists of canonical representatives of their structure constant s matrices the description of two dimensional power associative algebras over the field of complex numbers and r has been given in 24 however the approach considered in the paper is totally different from that of 24 and the same time the results of the paper confirm those of 24 in the case of field of complex and real numbers moreover we solve the problem over the fields of finite characteristic case as well as to the descriptions of some other classes of two dimensional algebras we refer the reader to 2 5 8 17 20 23 we consider two dimensional power associative algebras over algebraically closed fields of charac teristic not 2 3 characteristic 2 characteristic 3 and over r separately according to classification results of 1 11 to the best knowledge of the authors the descriptions of left right unital two dimensional algebras over algebraically closed fields and r

product of the matrices a and b over f let a be a m dimensional algebra over f and e e 1 e 2 em be its basis then the bilinear binary operation is represented by a matrix a akij m m m 2 f as follows u v ea u v where u eu v ev and u u 1 u 2 um t v v 1 v 2 vm t are the column coordinate vectors of u and v respectively the matrix a m m m 2 f defined above is called the matrix of structure constants msc of a with respect to the basis e further we assume that the basis e is fixed and we do not make a difference between the algebra a and its msc a see 10 if e e 1 e 2 e m is another basis of a e g e with g g gl m f and a is msc of a with respect to e then we have a ga g 1 2 1 thus the isomorphism of algebras a and b over f can be given in terms of msc as follows definition 1 two m dimensional algebras a b over f given by their matrices of structure constants a b are said to be isomorphic if there exists g gl m f such that b ga g 1 2 in the paper we deal with a class of algebras called power associative algebras the definition is given as follows definition 2 an algebra a is said to be power associative if its every subalgebra generated by a single element is associative here are the basic results which are used in the paper first of all we need results concerning the minimal independent system of identities for power associativity of algebras the problem has been studied in 6 7 19 in 6 the author has shown that the algebra a over a field f char f 0 is power associative if and only if u u u 0 u 2 u u 0 for all u a where u v w uv w u vw is the associator of u v w a if f is an infinite field of finite characteristic p then the variety of power associative algebras over the f can not be defined by a finite system of identities this case has been considered in 19 and the final result is given as follows if char f 2 char f 3 char f 5 char f p 5 then an algebra a over f is power associative if and only if u u 3 u 0 un 2 u u 0 for all u a n 3 2 k k 2 3 respectively un 2 u u 0 for all u a n 4 5 3 k k 1 2 3 un 2 u u 0 for all u a n 3 4 6 5 k k 1 2 3 un 2 u u 0 for all u a n 3 4 pk k 1 2 3 where un un 1 u for all n 1 2 3 and u 1 u by definition further we consider only the case m 2 and for the simplicity we use a 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 for msc where 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 stand for elements of f structure constants of a the next we need results from 1 11 on classification of all algebra structures on two dimensional vector space over a field f ofchar f 6 2 3 char f 2 char f 3 and f r cases respectively lobachevskii journal of mathematics power associative algebras 3 theorem 2

conditions stated earlier for power associativity of two dimensional algebras proposition 3 5 a two dimensional algebra a is power associative if and only if u u u 0 u 2 u u 0 for all u a proof it is evident that one needs only the proof of if part so let u u u 0 u 2 u u 0 for all u a due to the dimension reason for any element u a there exist a b f such that u 3 au 2 bu therefore for any n 3 the equality un 2 u u 0 is true that is in char f 6 2 case the proposition is true in the case of char f 2 we have u u 3 u u au 2 bu u a u u 2 u b u u u a u u 2 u and u u 2 u u 3 u uu 3 au 2 bu u u au 2 bu 0 this completes the proof due to proposition 3 5 to describe all two dimensional power associative algebras it is enough to find out which of the algebra among those in theorems 3 1 3 4 satisfies

algebra a is called a left respectively right unit if 1 l u u respectively u 1 r u for all u a an algebra with the left right unit element is said to be left right unital algebra respectively lobachevskii journal of mathematics power associative algebras 15 now we can describe up to isomorphism all two dimensional left right unital power associative algebras over an algebraically closed field f and r to do this it is sufficient to compare the algebras listed in theorems 3 6 3 9 with the two dimensional left right unital algebras given in 2 as an immediate consequence of the theorems
