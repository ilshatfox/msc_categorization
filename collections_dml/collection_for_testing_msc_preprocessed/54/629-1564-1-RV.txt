a note on minimal separating function sets raushan buzyakova and oleg okunev abstract we study point separating function sets that are minimal with respect to the property of being separating we first show that for a compact space x having a minimal separating function set in cp x is equivalent to having a minimal separating collection of functionally open sets in x we also identify a nice visual property of x 2 that may be responsible for the existence of a minimal separating function family for x in cp x we then discuss various questions and directions around the topic 1 introduction in this discussion we assume that all spaces are tychonov in notations and terminology we will follow 2 and 1 recall that a function set f cp x is point separating if for every distinct x y x there exists f f such that f x 6 f y we will refer to such sets as separating function sets ample research has been done on separating function sets it is natural to look for separating sets that have additional nice properties such as compactness metrizability etc note that it is quite likely that a randomly rendered sep arating function set contains a proper separating subset with perhaps better topological properties with this in mind we would like to take a closer look at minimal separating function sets definition a set f cp x is a minimal separating function set if f is separating for x and no proper subset of f is separating if f is separating closed compact and has not no proper closed compact separating subset f is a minimal closed compact separating function set in this paper we are concerned with the following general problem problem what properties of x xn are sufficient necessary for x to have a minimal separating function set in cp x a minimal closed compact sepa rating function set in cp x 1991 mathematics subject classification 54 c 35 54 e 45 54 a 25 key words and phrases cp x minimal point separating function set discrete space the diagonal of a space 1 2 r buzyakova and o okunev in the first part of our study we will concentrate on minimal separating functions sets and then we will zoom into minimal closed compact separating function sets 2 equivalence in this section we would like to make an observation that for a compact space x having a minimal separating function set in cp x is equivalent to having a minimal point separating family of functionally open subsets in x one part of this equivalence is quite obvious but the other requires some work recall that a family of subsets of x is called point separating if for any two distinct elements x and y in x there exists an element in the family that contains x or y but not both such a family is minimal if no proper subfamily of it is point separating theorem 2 1 if x has a minimal separating family of functionally open sets then x has a minimal separating function set proof let o be a family as in the hypothesis for each o o fix fo x 0 1 such that f 1 0 1 o clearly fo o o is a minimal separating function set to reverse the statement of theorem 2 1 we first prove four very technical assertions proposition 2 2 let x have a sized minimal separating function set then there exists a sized d x x x that is discrete and closed in x x x proof fix a minimal separating function set f cp x of cardinality by minimality for each f f we can fix distinct xf yf in f that are separated by f but not by any other function in f f the set d xf yf f f is a subset of x x x to show that d is a closed discrete subset in the off diagonal fix x y in x x with x 6 y we need to show that x y can be separated from d x y by an open neighborhood since f is separating there exists h f such that h x 6 h y let h x h y 3 recall that h does not separate xf from yf if h 6 f therefore h x h x h y h y is a desired open neighborhood of x y in our discussion we will reference not only the statement of proposition 2 2 but its argument too namely the definition of d in terms of elements of f a note on minimal separating function sets 3 lemma 2 3 there exists a collection un n 1 2 of open subsets of r with the following properties 1 un n 1 2 is point separating 2 un contains 0 for each n 1 2 3 un is the only element of the collection that separates 0 from 1 n proof put s 0 1 n n 1 2 since r is second countable and s is closed in r we can fix p an bn n 1 2 with the following properties p 1 an bn are open in r and their closures miss s p 2 a n b n p 3 for any distinct x y r s there exists n such that x an and y bn by p 1 for each n we can fix an open neighborhood on of s that misses a n b n put un on 1 n an let us show that u un n 1 2 is as desired properties 2 and 3 are incorporated in the definition of un s to show that u is point separating fix distinct x y r we have three cases case x y 6 s by p 3 there exists n such that x an and y bn then x un since o n and a n miss b n we conclude that un misses bn therefore y 6 un case x 6 s y s pick any positive integer k such that y 6 1 k and x 6 k since x k 6 s and k 6 x by p 3 there exists n such that k an and x bn then un contains y but does not contain x case x y s we may assume that x 1 n then un contains y but not x the proof is complete lemma 2 4 there exists a collection un n 1 2 of open subsets of r with the following properties 1 un n 1 2 is point separating 2 un is the only element of the collection that separates 1 n from 1 n proof put s 0 1 n n 1 2 since r is second countable and s is closed in r we can fix p an bn n 1 2 with the following properties p 1 an bn are open in r and their closures miss s p 2 a n b n p 3 for any distinct x y r s there exists n such that x an and y bn 4 r buzyakova and o okunev by p 1 for each n we can fix an open neighborhood on of s that misses a n b n put u 1 o 1 1 a 1 if n 1 put un on 1 n 1 n 1 an let us show that u un n 1 2 is as desired property 2 in the conclusion of the lemma s statement is incorporated in the definition of un s to show that u is point separating fix distinct x y r if x or y is in r s then the argument is as in lemma 2 3 we now assume that x y s we have three cases case x 0 then y 1 n 1 for some n hence un separates x and y case x 1 n y 1 n then un separates x and y case x 1 n y 1 m n m then um 1 does not contain 1 m y but contains 1 n x the proof is complete note that un n s constructed in lemmas 2 3 and 2 4 are minimal point separating families of functionally open sets of r the participating sequences can be replaced by any non trivial convergent sequences as well as r can be replaced by any non discrete second countable space either of the above two lemmas imply the following corollary 2 5 any separable metric space x has a minimal separating family of functionally open sets we are now ready to prove the reverse of of theorem 2 1 theorem 2 6 let x have a minimal separating function set then x has a minimal separating collection of functionally open set proof fix a minimal separating function set f cp x by corollary 2 5 we may assume that f is infinite partition f into f f so that each f is countably infinite for each f we will define u so that u u f will be a minimal point separating family of functionally open subsets of x first for each f f fix xf and yf in x that are separated by f and no any other member of f construction of u put h f f f since h x is compact there exists fn n f and l h x such that lim n xfn l by the argument of proposition 2 2 the set xf yf f f is closed and discrete in x x x therefore lim n yfn l too since xf 6 yf for each f we may a note on minimal separating function sets 5 assume that xfn n yfn n and that no yfn is equal to l we then have two cases case 1 xfn l for all n case 2 xfn 6 xfm 6 l for all n 6 m independently on which case takes place by lemmas 2 3 and 2 4 we can find a collection o on n of open sets in h x that separates points of h x so that only o n separates xfn from yfn put u h 1 o o o let us show that u u f is point separating and minimal with respect to this property to show that u is point separating fix distinct x y x since f is a point separating function set there exists f f f that separates x and y then h x 6 h y since o is a point separating family of open subsets of h x there exists o o that contains exactly one of h x and h y hence h 1 o u u separates x and y to show minimality of u with respect to being point separating fix u u then u h 1 o for some o o then there exists f f such that o is the only element that separates xf and yf since f is the only function in f that separates xf and yf we conclude that u is the only element of u that separates xf and yf theorems 2 1 and 2 6 imply the promised equivalence theorem 2 7 a compact space x has a minimal separating function set in cp x if and only if x has a minimal separating family of functionally open subsets in x 3 minimal separating function sets in this section the property of having a minimal separating function sets will be often referred to as the property and will be studies exclusively from the point of view of cp theory despite theorem 2 7 the rational behind this choice is that any such set is necessarily discrete in itself proposition 3 1 and discrete separating sets have attracted attention of many cp enthusiasts first observe that a space can have minimal separating function sets of different cardinalities indeed one can easily construct a one and a two element min imal separating function families for x 1 2 3 while cardinality is not a common property among minimal function sets the absence of cluster points is 6 r buzyakova and o okunev proposition 3 1 any minimal separating function set is discrete in itself proof let f cp x be a minimal separating set fix any f f since f is minimal there exist distinct x y x that are separated by f but not by any other member of f put f x f y 3 then u g g x f x g y f y is an open neighborhood of f that misses f f the statement of 3 1 is the main reason we consider our study from the point of view of cp theory in 3 it was proved that if x is a zero dimensional space of pseudoweight of uncountable cofinality then x has a discrete separating function set of size if and only if xn has a discrete set of size for some n this and proposition 2 2 prompt the following question question 3 2 let x be a zero dimensional space of pseudo weight and let x x x has a closed discrete subspace of size does cp x have a minimal separating set this observation naturally prompts a question of whether our property is equiv alent to having a discrete separating function set we will next identify a naive example among well known spaces that does not have the property under dis cussion but has a discrete function separating set example 3 3 the space has a discrete separating function set but no min imal separating function set proof recall that is a zero dimensional compactum that has a 2 sized separating family of clopen sets and a discrete in itself subset of cardinality 2 by 3 theorem 2 8 and corollary 2 19 has a discrete separating function set since is countably compact it cannot contain a discrete closed subset hence by proposition 2 2 does not have a minimal separating function set now that we have established the existence of spaces without the property it would be nice to isolated significant classes of spaces that have the property we have already proved that separable metric spaces have the property theorem 2 1 and corollary 2 5 in fact all metric spaces have the property we will derive it from a more general statement that we will prove next for this by a x we denote the largest cardinal if exists for which there exists a closed subset a x that contains at most one non isolated point recall that w x denotes the weight of x a note on minimal separating function sets 7 theorem 3 4 let x be a normal space and a x w x then x has a minimal separating function set proof let s be a closed subset of x with at most one non isolated point and of size equal to w x if s has a non isolated point denote it by p otherwise give this name to an arbitrary point of s since s is closed we can fix a w x sized family a of closed sets with the following properties a 1 for any distinct x y x s there exist disjoint ax ay a containing x and y respectively a 2 a x s let p be the set of all unordered pairs of disjoint elements of a enumerate p as a b w x and enumerate s p as p w x next for each w x fix a continuous function f x r that has the following properties f 1 f s p 0 f 2 f p 1 f 3 f a 1 3 f 4 f b 2 3 such a function exists because a b s p and p are mutually disjoint closed subsets of a normal space by a 1 a 2 and f 1 f 4 f is separating by f 1 f 2 f is the only function that separates p from p hence f is a minimal separating family of functions corollary 3 5 every metric space has a minimal separating function set our next goal is to investigate the behavior of the property within standard structures and under standard operations first we will show that any space can be embedded into a space with the property as a closed subset or even as clopen subset for our next statement recall that xx is a standard notation for the alexandroff double xx of a space x proposition 3 6 the alexandroff double of any infinite space x has a minimal separating set of functions of cardinality x proof put x since x is tychonoff and x there exists a separating family f cp x that has cardinality arrange elements of f into a sequence f so that every f appears in the sequence infinitely many times 8 r buzyakova and o okunev enumerate elements of x as x next for each define g xx r as follows g p f p p x f x p x for some 6 f x 1 p x clearly g is continuous and coincides with f on x let us show that g g is a minimal separating family of functions for xx to prove that g separates points of xx fix arbitrary distinct p q xx either both points are in x or both are in x or one is in x and the other is in x let us consider these three cases separately case p q x the conclusion follows from the facts that f separates points of x and that g s are extensions of f s case p q x there exist distinct such that p x q x since f separates points of x there exists such that f x 6 f x since f appears in the enumeration infinitely many times we may assume that 6 then g p 6 g q case p x q x there exist such that p x q x if then g separates p and q otherwise we proceed as in case 2 thus g is point separating finally only g separates x from x therefore g is minimal an argument analogous to that of proposition 3 6 proves the following state ment proposition 3 7 let x be an infinite space and let dx be a discrete space of cardinality x then x dx has a minimal separating set of functions of cardinality x propositions 3 6 and 3 7 may create an illusion that any kind of doubling guar antees the presence of the studied property in the resulting double space however the most basic doubling namely x 0 1 need not guarantee any such improvement indeed 0 1 is homeomorphic to itself and there fore does not have the property by example 3 3 this observation prompts the following question 3 8 let x 0 1 have a minimal separating function set does x have such a set a note on minimal separating function sets 9 statements of example 3 3 and proposition 3 7 imply that the property is not inherited by closed open and even clopen subspaces the following question may still be answered in affirmative question 3 9 let x have a minimal separating family of functions does every open dense subset have the property our next observation balances some of the negative statements above theorem 3 10 let x have a minimal separating function set for each a then ax has a minimal separating function set proof fix a minimal separating family f for each x put f f p a f f clearly this family is separating because for any two distinct points x y in the product there is an a such that p x 6 p y and there is an f f with f p x 6 f p y this family is minimal because if we remove some f p then there are a b x that are not separated by f f now let x and y be points of the product whose th coordinates are a and b and all the remaining coordinates are equal then the only projection that separates these points is p and the images under p are not separated in x by f f and that s it next let us look for traces of the property in images and pre images since any discrete spaces has the property the property is not preserved by continuous maps even bijective ones statements of example 3 3 and proposition 3 6 imply that the property is not inherited by taking the inverse image under a continuous injection on a positive note the domain of a continuous bijection has the property if the range does indeed let f be a minimal separating function set for x and let h y x be a continuous bijection put g f h f f since h is injective g is a separating family for y since f is minimal for each f f we can fix distinct x 1 x 2 x that are separated by f but not any other function in f by surjectivity y 1 h 1 x 1 y 2 h 1 x 2 are defined clearly y 1 and y 2 are separated by f h but not any other function in g let us record our observation as a statement proposition 3 11 if x admits a continuous bijection onto a space with a minimal separating set of functions then x has such a set too our discussion prompts the following question 10 r buzyakova and o okunev question 3 12 let x have a minimal separating set of functions and let y be t equivalent to x does y have such a set 4 a glance at minimal separating closed or compact function sets it is always natural to expect more interesting assertions about more rigid struc tures with this in mind we will next apply the minimality requirement within narrower classes of function sets for convenience let us recall the definitions from the introduction section definition 4 1 we say that f cp x is a minimal compact separating set if it is compact and separating and contains no proper compact separating subset similarly f cp x is a minimal closed separating set if it is closed and separating and contains no proper closed separating subset let us start with a non finite example of a minimal compact separating function set example 4 2 x 0 1 n 1 n has a minimal compact separating set proof let fn x 1 n 1 if x 1 n 1 and 0 otherwise then fn n converges to 0 therefore k 0 fn n is compact the function fn is the only one that separates 1 n 1 from 0 and every compact subspace of k that contains all fn is all of k the argument of example 4 2 can be used to prove the following statement proposition 4 3 let f be a minimal separating function set of x then clcp x f is minimal closed separating function set statements 4 2 and 4 3 prompt the following questions question 4 4 is there a minimal closed compact separating function set without an isolated point question 4 5 does every second countable compact space have a minimal compact separating functionset any eberlein compactum a note on minimal separating function sets 11 question 4 6 does having a minimal closed compact separating function set imply having a minimal separating function set question 4 7 is the property of having a minimal compact closed function set productive question 4 8 let x have a second countable separating function set does x have a minimal separating function set we would like to finish with two questions that were the main targets of this study and partly addressed by proposition 2 2 and theorem 2 7 question 4 9 is it true that cp x has a minimal separating sized subset if and only if x 2 x has a closed discrete sized subset what if x is compact what if x is zero dimensional question 4 10 is it true that having a minimal function separating set is equivalent to having a minimal separating family of
