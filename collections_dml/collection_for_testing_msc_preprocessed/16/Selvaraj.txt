identity and all modules are unitary denote by r mod the category of left r modules and by mod r the category of right r modules as usual pdr m idr m and fdr m will denote the projective injective and flat dimensions of an r modulem respectively we use fn to stand for the class of all rightr modules with flat dimension at most n and w gl dim r to stand for the weak global dimension of a ring r for unexplained concepts and notations we refer the reader to 1 5 13 16 we first recall some known notions and facts needed in the sequel given a class c of right r modules we write c m mod r ext 1 r c m 0 c c c m mod r ext 1 r m c 0 c c let c be a class of right r modules and m a right r module following 5 we say that a map f homr c m with c c is a c precover of m if the group homomorphism homr c f homr c c homr c m is surjective for each c c a c precover f homr c m of m is called a c cover of m if f is right minimal that is if fg f implies that g is an automorphism for each g endr c dually we have the definition of c preenvelope c envelope a c envelope m c is said to have the unique mapping property 3 if for every any homomor phism f m c withc c there is a unique homomorphism g c c such that g f dually we have the definition of c cover with unique mapping property following 5 a monomorphism m c with c c is said to be a special c preenvelope of m if coker c dually we have the definition of a special c precover special c preenvelopes resp special c precovers are obviously c preenvelopes resp c precovers in general c covers c envelopes may not exist if exists they are unique up to isomorphism a pair f c of classes of rightr modules is called a cotorsion theory 5 if f c and c f a cotorsion theory f c is called complete 15 if every right r module has a special c preenvelope e mail selvavlr yahoo com e mail prabakaranpvkr gmail com 2 c selvaraj and p prabakaran and a special f precover a cotorsion theory f c is called perfect 6 if every right r module has a c envelope and an f cover a cotorsion theory f c is called hereditary 6 if whenever 0 l l l 0 is exact with l l f then l is also in f by 6 proposition 1 2 f c is hereditary if and only if whenever 0 c c c 0 is exact with c c c then c is also in c a right r module m is called fp injective 14 if ext 1 r f m 0 for all finitely presented right r modules f accordingly the fp injective dimension of m denoted by fp id m is defined to be the smallest n 0 such that extn 1 r f m 0 for all finitely presented right r modules f if no such n exists set fp id m we use fpn to stand for the class of all right r modules with fp injective dimension at most n a left r module m is called super finitely presented 8 if there exists an exact sequence f 1 f 0 m 0 where each fi is finitely generated and projective following this gao and wang in 9 gave the definitions of weak injective and weak flat modules in terms of super finitely presented modules a leftr modulem is called weak injective ifext 1 r f m 0 for any super finitely presented left r module f a right r module n is called weak flat if torr 1 n f 0 for any super finitely presented left r module f accordingly the weak injective dimension of a left r module m denoted by widr m is defined to be the smallest n 0 such that extn 1 r f m 0 for all super finitely presented left r modules f if no such n exists set widr m the weak flat dimension of a right r module n denoted by wfdr n is defined to be the smallest n 0 such that torrn 1 n f 0 for all super finitely presented left r modules f if no such n exists set wfdr n the left super finitely presented dimension denoted by l sp gldim r of a ring r is defined as l sp gldim r sup pdr m m is a super finitely presented left r module let n be a fixed non negative integer in what follows the symbol win wfn denotes the class of all left right r modules with weak injective weak flat dimension less than or equal to n in 12 mao and ding proved that fn f n is a perfect hereditary cotorsion theory and introduced the notion of n cotorsion modules recently zhao proved wfn wf n is a perfect hereditary cotorsion theory in 17 proposition 4 18 inspired by 12 17 in this paper we will introduce and study the notion of n weak cotorsion modules in section 2 n weak cotorsion modules are defined and studied a right r module n is called an n weak cotorsion module if n wf n for a ring with wid r n we prove that a right r module m is n weak cotorsion if and only if m is a kernel of a wfn precover f a b with a injective if and only ifm is a direct sum of an injective rightr module and a reduced n weak cotorsion rightr module in section 3 we characterize rings with finite super finitely presented dimension in terms of among others n weak cotorsion modules it is proven that l sp gldim r n if and only if every n weak cotorsion right r module is injective if and only if every n weak cotorsion right r module belongs to wfn it is also shown that if every n weak cotorsion right r module has a wfn envelope with the unique mapping property then l sp gldim r n 2 2 n weak cotorsion modules for any ring r and a fixed non negative integer n it is known that wfn wf n is a perfect hereditary cotorsion theory by 17 proposition 4 18 in this section n weak cotorsion modules are defined to be the modules in the class wf n we start with the following definition 1 let r be a ring and n a fixed non negative integer a right r module n is called n weak cotorsion module if ext 1 r f n 0 for any right r module f wfn in what follows wcn stands for the class of all n weak cotorsion right r modules by definition 1 we have the following proposition lobachevskii journal of mathematics on n weak cotorsion modules 3 proposition 1 the following assertions hold 1 let ci be a family of right r modules then i ci is n weak cotorsion if and only if each ci is n weak cotorsion 2 wcn is closed under extensions and direct summands 3 if m n then every m weak cotorsion modules is n weak cotorsion recall that a right r module c is called cotorsion 4 provided that ext 1 r f c 0 for any flat right r module f for a fixed non negative integer n a right r module m is called n cotorsion 12 if ext 1 r n m 0 for any n fn 0 cotorsion modules are preciously cotorsion modules remark 1 1 for any non negative integer n we have the following implications injective modules n weak cotorsion modules n cotorsion modules cotorsion modules 2 if r is a coherent ring then n weak cotorsion modules coincide with n cotorsion modules since l sp gldim r w gl dim r the following theorem is due to zhao 17 proposition 4 17 and proposition 4 18 theorem 1 let n be a fixed non negative integer then following hold 1 for a ring r with widr rr n win wi n is a perfect cotorsion theory 2 for any ring r wfn wcn is a perfect hereditary cotorsion theory proposition 2 let r be a ring m and n two non negative integers 1 if c is an n weak cotorsion right r module then exti 1 r c m 0 for any integer i m and any m wfm n 2 the mth cosyzygy of any n weak cotorsion right r module is m n weak cotorsion proof 1 for any m wfm n we have an exact sequence 0 km pm 1 pm 2 p 1 p 0 m 0 with each pi is projective it is clear that km wfn therefore extm 1 r m c ext 1 r km c 0 since c is n weak cotorsion and the result follows by induction 2 let c be any n weak cotorsion right r module and lm the mth cosyzygy of c note that ext 1 r f l m extm 1 r f c 0 for any f wfm n by 1 thus l m is m n weak cotorsion proposition 3 let r be a ring and n a right r module then the following are equivalent 1 n is n weak cotorsion 2 n is injective with respect to every exact sequence 0 k m l 0 where l wfn moreover if widr rr n then the above conditions are also equivalent to 3 for every exact sequence 0 n e l 0 where e is injective e l is a wfn precover of l 4 n is a kernel of a wfn precover e l with e injective lobachevskii journal of mathematics 4 c selvaraj and p prabakaran proof 1 2 is obvious 2 1 for every right r module l wfn there is a short exact sequence 0 k p l 0 with p projective which induces an exact sequence hom p n hom k n ext 1 r l n 0 since hom f n hom k n 0 is exact by 2 ext 1 r l n 0 so 1 follows 1 3 let 0 n e l 0 be an exact sequence with e injective then e wfn is by 17 proposition 4 11 for any right r module f wfn the exact sequence 0 n e l 0 induces the exact sequence 0 hom f n hom f e hom f l ext 1 r f n 0 so e l is a wfn precover of l 3 4 it follows from the exact sequence 0 n e n l 0 and 3 4 1 let n be a kernel of a wfn precover e l with e injective then we have an exact sequence 0 n e l 0 so we have the exact sequence hom m e hom m l ext 1 r m n 0 for each right r module m wfn note that hom m e hom m l 0 is exact by 4 hence ext 1 r m n 0 as desired the following example shows that wf 0 the class of all 0 weak cotorsion modules is a proper subclass of f 0 class of all cotorsion modules and wf 1 the class of all 1 weak cotorsion modules is a proper subclass of f 1 class of all 1 cotorsion modules example 1 as gao mentioned in 9 remark 3 11 2 we have a ring r with l sp gldim r 0 but w gl dim r 0 by 11 theorem 3 4 and from 2 we have a ring r with l sp gldim r 1 but w gl dim r 1 then f 0 resp f 1 is a proper subclass of wf 0 resp wf 1 note that for any non negative integer n fn f n and wfn wf n are cotorsion theories by 12 theorem 3 4 2 and 17 proposition 4 18 respectively so wf 0 resp wf 1 is a proper subclass of f 0 resp f 1 recall that an r module m is said to be reduced 5 if m has no non zero injective submodules proposition 4 let r be a ring with widr rr n then the following are equivalent for a right r module m 1 m is a reduced n weak cotorsion right r module 2 m is a kernel of a wfn cover f a b with a injective proof 1 2 consider an exact sequence 0 m e m e m m 0 by proposition 3 the natural map e m e m m is a wfn precover thus e m has no non zero direct summand k contained in m since m is reduced note that e m m has a wfn cover by theorem 1 2 it follows that e m e m m is a wfn cover by 16 corollary 1 2 8 and hence 2 follows 2 1 let m be a kernel of a wfn cover f a b with a injective by proposition 3 m is n weak cotorsion now let k be an injective submodule of m suppose a k l p a l is the projection and i l a is the inclusion it is easy to see that f k 0 and f ip f this implies that ip is an isomorphism thus i is an epimorphism and hence a l k 0 so m is reduced theorem 2 let r be a ring with wid rr n then a right r module m is n weak cotorsion if and only if m is a direct sum of an injective right r module and a reduced n weak cotorsion right r module lobachevskii journal of mathematics on n weak cotorsion modules 5 proof is clear letm be an n weak cotorsion rightr module consider an exact sequence 0 m e m e m m 0 by proposition 3 e m e m m is a wfn precover of e m m but e m m has a wfn cover l e m m by theorem 1 2 so we have the commutative diagram with exact rows 0 k f l e m m 0 0 m e m e m m 0 0 k f l e m m 0 note that is an isomorphism and so e m ker im since im l thus l and ker are injective thereforek is a reduced n weak cotorsion module by proposition 4 by the five lemma is an isomorphism hence we have m im ker where im k in addition we get the following commutative diagram 0 0 0 0 ker ker 0 0 0 m e m e m m 0 0 k f l e m m 0 0 0 0 hence ker ker this completes the proof theorem 3 let r be a ring then the following are equivalent 1 every right r module is n weak cotorsion 2 every right r module in wfn is projective 3 every right r module in wfn is n weak cotorsion 4 ext 1 r m n 0 for all right r modules m n wfn 5 extir m n 0 for all i 1 and all right r modules m n wfn 6 every right r module m has a wcn envelope with the unique mapping property proof 1 2 it follows from theorem 1 2 1 4 3 4 5 and 1 6 are trivial 6 3 let m mfn then we have the following commutative diagram lobachevskii journal of mathematics 6 c selvaraj and p prabakaran 0 0 m m 0 uuu uuuu uuuu uuuu uuuu u wcn m l nn nnn nnn nn l l 0 wcn l where l mfn by wakamatsu s lemma 16 lemma 2 1 2 note that l m 0 0 m so l 0 by 6 therefore l im ker l 0 and hence m is n weak cotorsion thus 3 follows 3 1 letm be a rightr module by theorem 1 2 m has a special wfn precover and hence there exists a short exact sequence 0 k n m 0 where k wfn and n wcn since n is n weak cotorsion by 3 m is n weak cotorsion by theorem 1 2 so 1 follows in general l sp gldim r w gl dim r see 9 remark 3 7 3 here we have the following theorem 4 the following are equivalent for a ring r 1 l sp gldim r w gl dim r 2 wfn fn for any n 0 3 every n cotorsion module is n weak cotorsion for any n 0 proof 1 2 3 is trivial 3 2 since wfn wf n and fn f n are cotorsion theories for any integer n 0 so the assertion hold 3 applications in this section we characterize rings with finite super finitely presented dimension in terms among others of n weak cotorsion modules we start with the following lemma 1 let r be a ring with wid rr n and n 1 if m wi n 1 then there is an exact sequence 0 k e m 0 such that e is injective and k wi n proof let m wi n 1 and 0 n p m 0 an exact sequence of left r modules where p is projective consider the following pushout diagram 0 0 0 n p m 0 0 n e p d 0 l l 0 0 lobachevskii journal of mathematics on n weak cotorsion modules 7 where p is projective and p e p is an injective envelope note that widr p n by 17 proposition 4 11 it follows that widr l n 1 by 9 proposition 3 3 then ext 1 r l m 0 since m wi n 1 thus the exact sequence 0 m d l 0 is split and som is a quotient ofe p now let f e m be a weak injective cover of m with e injective then f is epic so we have the exact sequence 0 k e m 0 note thatk wi 0 we claim thatk wi n letf win and consider the exact sequence 0 e f g 0 theng win 1 by 9 proposition 3 3 so we have the exact sequence 0 ext 1 r g m ext 2 r g k ext 2 r g e 0 thus ext 2 r g k 0 on the other hand the exactness of the sequence 0 f e f g 0 induces the exact sequence 0 ext 1 r e f k ext 1 r f k ext 2 r g k 0 therefore ext 1 r f k 0 and so k wi n the following theorem extends the result of zhao 17 proposition 4 12 theorem 5 the following are equivalent for a ring r and a fixed non negative integer n 1 l sp gldim r n 2 every n weak cotorsion right r module is injective 3 every n weak cotorsion right r module is in wfn 4 ext 1 r m n 0 for all n weak cotorsion right r modules m n 5 extir m n 0 for all i 1 and all n weak cotorsion right r modules m n 6 every right r module m has a wfn cover with the unique mapping property if n 1 then the above conditions are also equivalent to 7 every left r module has weak injective dimension at most n 8 every right r module has weak flat dimension at most n 9 every left r module has a monic win 1 cover 10 every right r module has an epic wfn 1 envelope 11 every quotient of any weak injective left r module is in win 1 12 every submodule of any weak flat right r module is in wfn 1 13 the kernel of any win 1 precover of any left r module is in win 1 14 the cokernel of any wfn 1 preenvelope of any right r module is in wfn 1 proof the equivalence of 7 14 with 1 follows from 17 proposition 4 12 1 2 it follows from theorem 1 2 1 3 4 5 and 1 6 are trivial 6 3 let m be any n weak cotorsion right r module then we have the following commuta tive diagram lobachevskii journal of mathematics 8 c selvaraj and p prabakaran wfn k k k nn nnn nnn nn 0 vvv vvvv vvvv vvvv vvvv vv 0 k wfn m m m 0 0 note that m k 0 m 0 so k 0 by 8 therefore k im k ker 0 and so m wfn as required 3 1 let m be any right r module by theorem 1 2 there exists a shot exact sequence 0 m c l 0 with c wcn and l wfn then c wfn by 3 and hence m wfn thus l sp gldim r n remark 2 note that if r is a coherent ring then theorem 5 gives some of the equivalent conditions proved in 12 theorem 6 4 theorem 6 let r be a ring with widr rr n for a fixed n 1 then the following are equivalent 1 l sp gldim r 2 l sp gldim r n 3 every left r module in wi n 1 is injective 4 every left r module in wi n 1 is weak injective 5 every left r module in wi n is weak injective 6 every left r module in wi n is injective 7 every left r module in wi n belongs to win proof 2 1 3 4 5 and 6 5 are trivial 1 2 by 10 proposition 4 2 l sp gldim r wid rr n 1 7 follows from theorem 1 1 7 1 let m be a left r module then by theorem 1 1 there is a short exact sequence 0 k f m 0 with k wi n and f win then k win by 8 and hence m win as desired 4 3 let m be any left r module in wi n 1 there exists an exact sequence 0 m e l 0 withe injective note thatl is weak injective by 4 and 9 proposition 3 3 and so the sequence is split since ext 1 r l m 0 therefore m is injective 5 4 follows from lemma 1 5 6 similar to the proof 4 3 recall that a ring r is called n fc ring if it is a left and right coherent ring with left and right self fp injective dimension is n from theorem 6 we get the following equivalent conditions proved by gao in 7 theorem 3 6 corollary 1 let r be a n fc ring with n 1 then the following are equivalent 1 w gl dim r lobachevskii journal of mathematics on n weak cotorsion modules 9 2 w gl dim r n 3 every left r module in fp n 1 is injective 4 every left r module in fp n 1 is fp injective 5 every left r module in fp n is fp injective 6 every left r module in fp n is injective 7 every left r module in fp n belongs to fpn proposition 5 the following are equivalent for a ring r and a fixed integer n 0 1 r is a semisimple artinian ring 2 every n weak cotorsion right r module is projective proof 1 2 is trivial 2 1 since every injective right r module is projective so r is a qf ring then every n cotorsion right r module is n weak cotorsion by remark 1 2 and hence r is semisimple artinian by 12 corollary 6 5 theorem 7 assume a ring r satisfies one of the following conditions 1 every n weak cotorsion right r module has a wfn envelope with the unique mapping property 2 every finitely presented right r module has a wfn envelope with the unique mapping property then l sp gldim r n 2 proof assume 1 let m be any right r module then we have the exact sequences 0 c i f 0 m 0 and 0 f 2 f 1 c 0 by theorem 1 2 where f 0 m and f 1 c are wfn covers c and f 2 are n weak cotorsion thus we get an exact sequence 0 f 2 f 1 i f 0 m 0 let f 2 h be an wfn envelope with the unique mapping property then there exists h f 1 such that thus 0 and hence 0 which implies that im ker im so there exists h f 2 such that and hence we get the following commutative diagram h b bb bb bb 0 f 2 oo f 1 f 0 m 0 note that and so 1 f 2 since is monic thus f 2 is isomorphic to a direct summand of h and hence f 2 wfn therefore wfdm n 2 and so l sp gldim r n 2 assume 2 by 3 lemma 3 2 every right r module has a wfn envelope with the unique mapping property since wfn is closed under direct limits so the result follows since the condition 1 is satisfied lobachevskii journal of mathematics 10 c selvaraj and p prabakaran references 1 f w anderson and k r fuller rings and categories
