rings whose elements are linear combinations of three commuting idempotents peter v danchev abstract we classify those rings in which all elements are linear combina tions over z of at most three commuting idempotents our results improve on recent publications by the author in albanian j math 2018 gulf j math 2018 bull iran math soc 2019 and boll un mat ital 2019 as well as on publications due to hirano tominaga in bull austral math soc 1988 ying et al in can math bull 2016 and tang et al in lin multilin algebra 2018 1 introduction and background everywhere in the text of the present paper all rings r are assumed to be associative containing the identity element 1 which differs from the zero element 0 of r the standard terminology and notations are mainly in agreement with 8 for instance u r denotes the set of all units in r id r the set of all idempotents in r nil r the set of all nilpotents in r and j r the jacobson radical of r as usual z stands for the ring of all integers and zk z kz is its quotient modulo the principal ideal k kz where k n is the set of all naturals about the specific notions they will be explained in detail below definition 1 1 we shall say that the ring r is from the classr 1 if for any r r there exist commuting each to other e 1 e 2 e 3 id r such that r e 1 e 2 e 3 or r e 1 e 2 e 3 obvious examples of such rings are the rings zk where k 2 3 4 5 6 con trasting with that the ring z 7 need not be so definition 1 2 we shall say that the ring r is from the classr 2 if for any r r there exist commuting each to other e 1 e 2 e 3 id r such that r e 1 e 2 e 3 or r e 1 e 2 e 3 2010 mathematics subject classification 16 u 99 16 e 50 13 b 99 key words and phrases linear combinations idempotents nilpotents boolean rings fields 1 2 p v danchev immediate examples of such rings are the rings zk where k 2 3 4 5 6 reciprocally the ring z 7 does not have that property the most important principally known achievements concerning the subject are as follows classically a ring is said to be boolean if each its element is an idempotent such a ring is known to be a subdirect product copies of the two element field f 2 a successful attempt to generalize that concept is made in 7 to those rings whose elements are the sum of two commuting idempotents in fact these rings are known to be commutative being a subdirect product of family of copies of the two and three element fields f 2 and f 3 respectively in particular if every element of a ring is an idempotent or minus an idempotent then this ring is either boolean or f 3 or a direct product of two such rings further extensions of these notions in terms of linear combinations over z of at most four commuting idempotents are subsequently given below in details r r r e 1

the aforementioned variations the ring is of necessity commutative our major tactic is to develop the technique exploited in 1 6 as well as to utilize some new tricks inspired by the specification of the ring structure specifi cally we shall carefully study the rings from definitions 1 1 and 1 2 characterizing them up to an isomorphism rings and linear combinations of three idempotents 3 2 main results for the reader s convenience and readability of the exposition we distribute our results into the following two subsections 2 1 rings from the class r 1 we start here with the following technicality proposition 2 1 any ring r from the class r 1 decomposes as r 1 r 2 r 3 where r 1 r 2 r 3 are rings also lying in the class r 1 such that 2 nil r 1 3 nil r 2 and 5 nil r 3 proof writing 3 e 1 e 2 e 3 we infer that 4 e 1 e 2 1 e 3 e 1 e 2 e 3 since e 2 e 3 e 2 1 e 3 e 3 1 e 2 is a difference of two orthogonal idempotents we may assume without loss of generality that e 2 e 3 0 consequently multiplying both sides of 4 e 1 e 2 e 3 by e 2 we get that 5 e 2 e 1 e 2 and hence 6 e 1 e 2 0 implying that 30 e 2 0 after that squaring 4 e 1 e 2 e 3 and taking into account that e 1 e 2 e 3 4 2 e 3 we derive that 20 2 e 3 2 e 1 e 2 2 e 1 e 3 the last equality being multiplied by e 1 leads to 20 e 1 2 e 1 e 2 and so 60 e 1 0 however 20 2 e 3 2 e 1 e 2 2 e 1 e 3 ensures that 600 60 e 3 and thus a simple manipulation in 4 e 1 e 2 e 3 leads to 360 8 9 5 0 whence 303 0 thus 30 2 3 5 nil r let us now 3 e 1 e 2 e 3 observing that e 2 e 3 e 2 1 e 3 e 3 1 e 2 is a difference of two orthogonal idempotents we can assume with no harm in generality that e 2 e 3 0 thus 3 e 2 e 1 e 2 e 2 means that 4 e 2 e 1 e 2 and 3 e 1 e 2 e 1 e 2 e 1 e 2 gives that 5 e 1 e 2 0 which assures that 20 e 2 0 similarly repeating the same procedure for e 1 one detects that 20 e 1 0 we further square 3 e 1 e 2 e 3 and deduce that 12 2 e 3 2 e 1 e 2 because e 1 e 2 e 3 3 2 e 3 multiplying both sides of the equality about 12 by e 3 we obtain that 10 e 3 0 therefore 3 20 e 1 e 2 e 3 20 0 i e 60 4 3 5 0 finally in both cases 2 3 5 must be a nilpotent and thus the chinese remain der theorem applies to conclude that r r 1 r 2 r 3 where r 1 r 2 r 3 are rings again from the class r 1 with 2 nil r 1 3 nil r 2 and 5 nil r 3 as formulated the following assertion is pivotal strengthening 1 proposition 2 2 lemma 2 2 suppose that r is a ring of characteristic 5 then the following three conditions are equivalent i x 3 x or x 4 1 x r ii x 3 x or x 4 1 x r 4 p v danchev iii x 3 x or x 3 x x r iv r is isomorphic to the field z 5 proof i iii for an arbitrary y r satisfying y 4 1 but y 3 y considering the element y 2 1 it must be that y 2 1 4 1 or y 2 1 3 y 2 1 in the first case we receive y 2 1 and thus y 3 y as required while in the second one we arrive at y 2 1 and so y 3 y which is against our initial assumption ii iii the same trick as that in the previous implication will work assuming now that y 3 y iii iv let p be the subring of r generated by 1 and thus note that p z 5 we claim that p r so we assume in a way of contradiction that there exists b r p with no loss of generality we shall also assume that b 3 b since b 3 b obviously implies that 2 b 3 2 b as 5 0 and b p 2 b p let us now 1 b 3 1 b hence b b 3 along with 5 0 enable us that b 2 1 this allows us to conclude that 1 2 b 3 1 2 b however in fact if 1 2 b 3 1 2 b then one deduces that 2 b 3 p which is manifestly untrue if now 1 2 b 3 1 2 b then one infers that 2 b 2 p which is obviously false that is why only 1 b 3 1 b holds this in turn guarantees that b 2 b moreover b 3 b is equivalent to b 3 b as well as b 3 b to b 3 b and thus by what we have proved so far applied to b p it follows that b b 2 b 2 b b consequently 2 b 0 6 b b p because 5 0 which is the wanted contradiction we thus conclude that p r as expected conversely it is trivial that the elements of z 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 are solutions of one of the equations x 3 x or x 3 x iv i ii it is self evident that all elements of z 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 satisfy one of the equations x 3 x or x 4 1 as well as one of x 3 x or x 4 1 we now come to the following theorem 2 3 a ring r lies in the class r 1 if and only if it is commutative and r r 1 r 2 r 3 where r 1 r 2 r 3 are rings for which 1 r 1 0 or r 1 j r 1 is a boolean factor ring with nil j r 1 2 id r 1 such that 4 0 2 r 2 0 or r 2 is a subdirect product of copies of the fields z 2 and z 3 rings and linear combinations of three idempotents 5 3 r 3 0 or r 3 z 5 proof necessity appealing to proposition 2 1 there is a decomposition r r 1 r 2 r 3 where the direct factors r 1 r 2 and r 3 still belong to the class r 1 what we need to do is to describe explicitly these three rings separately describing r 1 here 2 j r 1 we assert that 4 0 to establish this the proof of proposition 2 1 assures that 8 0 next write that 4 e 1 e 2 e 3 or that 4 e 1 e 2 e 3 in the first case the multiplication by e 1 e 2 e 3 gives that e 1 e 2 e 3 0 squaring the equality of 4 one infers that 4 2 e 1 e 2 2 e 2 e 3 2 e 3 e 1 multiplying this by e 1 e 2 we derive that 2 e 1 e 2 0 similarly 2 e 2 e 3 2 e 3 e 1 0 so 4 0 as promised in the second case the multiplication by e 1 e 2 e 3 guarantees that 3 e 1 e 2 e 3 0 again squaring the equation for 4 one deduces that 4 2 e 3 2 e 1 e 2 2 e 2 e 3 2 e 3 e 1 multiplying this by e 1 e 2 we detect that 2 e 1 e 2 2 e 1 e 2 e 3 so that 2 e 1 e 2 e 3 2 e 1 e 2 e 3 which means that 4 e 1 e 2 e 3 0 the last combined with 3 e 1 e 2 e 3 0 allows us to conclude that e 1 e 2 e 3 0 2 e 1 e 2 furthermore 4 e 3 2 e 1 e 2 2 is a guarantor that e 3 e 1 e 2 and thus 4 e 1 e 2 e 3 0 as promised and the claim really sustained we observe also that r 1 j r 1 is of characteristic 2 ring from the class r 1 thus it has to be a boolean ring what needs to show is the equality j r 1 2 id r 1 in fact given z j r 1 we write z e 1 e 2 e 3 or z e 1 e 2 e 3 for some three commuting idempotents e 1 e 2 e 3 in r 1 in the first case z 2 e 3 e 1 e 2 e 3 still lies in j r 1 since e 2 e 3 e 2 1 e 3 e 3 1 e 2 and e 2 1 e 3 e 3 0 we may assume that e 2 e 3 0 as in the proof of 4 theorem 2 2 one obtains that z 2 e 3 2 e 2 hence z 2 e 2 e 3 2 id r 1 as expected as the sum e 2 e 3 because e 2 e 3 are mutually orthogonal idempotents in the second case we may process as in the proof of 4 theorem 2 2 so we receive the pursued description of r 1 after all describing r 2 here 3 j r 2 we claim that j r 2 0 and that 3 0 in fact as in the preceding case for r 1 we have that j r 2 2 id r 2 or j r 2 2 id r 2 if for any j j r 2 we write j 2 i for some i id r 2 then j 3 i i j r 2 id r 2 0 whence i 0 j symmetrically if j 2 i then j 3 i i j r 2 id r 2 0 and hence i 0 j as required furthermore since 3 0 it easily follows that x 3 x for all x r 2 and thus 7 is applicable to get the wanted description of r 2 describing r 3 here 5 j r 3 we assert that j r 3 0 and that 5 0 indeed as in the previous case for r 1 we have that j r 3 2 id r 3 if for any j j r 3 we write j 2 i for some i id r 3 then 2 j 5 i i 6 p v danchev j r 3 id r 3 0 and hence i 0 j by a reason of symmetry if j 2 i then 2 j 5 i i j r 3 id r 3 0 whence i 0 j as required furthermore as 5 0 it readily follows that x 5 x for all x r 3 we now intend to show that there is a more precise situation that is any element x from r 3 satisfies x 4 1 or x 3 x to that goal writing x e 1 e 2 e 3 for some three commuting idempotents e 1 e 2 e 3 from r 3 we are processing in the same manner as in 1 theorem 2 3 case 3 to get that x 4 1 actually this equality holds under the substitution x x 1 writing next that x e 1 e 2 e 3 again for some three commuting idempotents e 1 e 2 e 3 of r 3 we may assume with no harm of generality that e 1 e 3 e 2 e 3 0 indeed x e 1 e 2 1 e 3 e 3 1 e 2 as the last two members are orthogonal idempotents so further x e 1 1 e 3 1 e 2 e 2 1 e 3 e 3 1 e 2 1 e 1 where all members retain idempotents as well as the first and the second ones are orthogonal with the third one as claimed squaring the initial equality we deduce that x 2 x 2 e 1 e 2 e 3 2 id r 3 as it is easily checked that the sum e 1 e 2 e 3 is an idempotent whence x 2 x 2 2 x 2 x this enables us that x 4 2 x 3 x 2 2 x 0 which by the substitution x x 1 leads to x 4 x 3 x 2 x 0 now replacing x by 2 x and respectively by 3 x in x 4 1 we once again detect that x 4 1 since 5 0 so that doing that in x 4 x 3 x 2 x 0 we have that x 4 2 x 3 x 2 2 x 0 and x 4 2 x 3 x 2 2 x 0 respectively these two equalities in combination imply that x 3 x as desired therefore lemma 2 2 i is now in use and we consequently obtain the wanted description of r 3 as being isomorphic to z 5 concerning the commutativity of the whole ring r since r 2 and r 3 are ob viously commutative what remains to show is that this property holds for r 1 this however follows by the utilization of 4 theorem 2 2 sufficiency a direct consultation with 7 informs us that every element of r 2 is a sum of two idempotents likewise as in 1 4 or 5 each element in r 1 is a sum of three idempotents since r 3 has only five elements we are therefore in a position to exploit the same manipulation as that in the corresponding results from 1 4 and 5 getting that the direct product r 1 r 2 r 3 belongs to the class r 1 as expected the next comments shed some more light on the examined object remark 2 4 the direct product z 5 z 5 does not lie in the class r 1 whereas the direct products z 4 z 5 and z 4 z 4 z 5 still lie moreover concerning the element wise presentation in these rings the crucial elements 1 4 and 2 4 having problems with their representation in 1 and 4 here work positively in rings and linear combinations of three idempotents 7 fact one has that 1 4 1 0 0 0 0 1 2 4 1 0 1 0 0 1 and 1 2 4 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 2 2 rings from the class r 2 we begin here with the following technicality proposition 2 5 any ring r from the class r 2 decomposes as r 1 r 2 r 3 where r 1 r 2 r 3 are rings also lying in the class r 2 such that 2 nil r 1 3 nil r 2 and 5 nil r 3 proof let firstly 3 e 1 e 2 e 3 so 4 e 1 e 2 1 e 3 e 1 e 2 e 3 since e 2 e 3 e 2 1 e 3 e 3 1 e 2 and this is a difference of two orthogonal idempotents we may assume with no harm of generality that e 2 e 3 0 therefore multiplying by e 2 both sides of 4 e 1 e 2 e 3 we obtain that 5 e 2 e 1 e 2 whence 6 e 1 e 2 0 and thus 30 e 2 0 furthermore squaring 4 e 1 e 2 e 3 and bearing in mind that e 1 e 2 e 3 4 2 e 3 we infer that 20 2 e 3 2 e 1 e 2 2 e 1 e 3 which being multiplied by e 1 leads to 20 e 1 2 e 1 e 2 so that 60 e 1 0 however 20 2 e 3 2 e 1 e 2 2 e 1 e 3 means then that 600 60 e 3 and so a plain manipulation in 4 e 1 e 2 e 3 gives that 360 8 9 5 0 and hence 303 0 thus 30 2 3 5 nil r let secondly 3 e 1 e 2 e 3 since e 1 e 2 e 1 1 e 2 e 2 1 e 1 is a difference of two orthogonal idempotents we with no loss of generality may assume that e 1 e 2 0 therefore by multiplying with e 1 both sides of the given equality we deduce that 4 e 1 e 1 e 3 whence 3 e 1 e 3 0 and so 12 e 1 0 further by squaring 3 e 1 e 2 e 3 and taking into account that e 1 e 2 e 3 2 e 1 3 we derive that 6 2 e 1 2 e 1 e 3 2 e 2 e 3 and multiplying this by e 3 and next by e 2 we get that 4 e 2 e 3 0 and hence 12 e 3 0 consequently the equality 6 2 e 1 2 e 1 e 3 2 e 2 e 3 allows us to conclude that 36 62 0 so that 6 nil r finally in both cases 2 3 5 must be a nilpotent and so the chinese remainder theorem yields that r r 1 r 2 r 3 where r 1 r 2 r 3 are rings again from the class r 2 with 2 nil r 1 3 nil r 2 and 5 nil r 3 as stated we now arrive at the following theorem 2 6 a ring r lies in the class r 2 if and only if it is commutative and r r 1 r 2 r 3 where r 1 r 2 r 3 are rings for which 1 r 1 0 or r 1 j r 1 is a boolean quotient ring with nil j r 1 2 id r 1 such that 4 0 2 r 2 0 or r 2 is a subdirect product of copies of the fields z 2 and z 3 3 r 3 0 or r 3 z 5 8 p v danchev proof necessity according to proposition 2 5 there is a decomposition r r 1 r 2 r 3 where the direct factors r 1 r 2 and r 3 still belong to the class r 2 what we need to do is to describe in an explicit form these three rings separately describing r 1 here 2 j r 1 we assert that 4 0 to establish this the proof of proposition 2 5 insures that 8 0 next we may write that 4 e 1 e 2 e 3 which follows identically to case 1 of theorem 2 3 and that 4 e 1 e 2 e 3 the latter after multiplying with e 1 e 2 e 3 forces that 5 e 1 e 2 e 3 0 and by squaring implies that 4 2 e 1 2 e 1 e 2 2 e 1 e 3 2 e 2 e 3 the multiplication of the last equation with e 1 e 2 yields that 4 e 1 e 2 0 whence 4 e 1 e 2 e 3 0 whence e 1 e 2 e 3 0 again multiplying the equality of 4 by e 2 e 3 now tells us that 2 e 2 e 3 0 consequently e 1 4 2 e 2 e 3 2 that is e 1 e 2 e 3 and hence 4 e 1 e 2 e 3 0 as promised this substantiates our assertion indeed we see also that r 1 j r 1 is of characteristic 2 ring from the class r 2 thus it has to be a boolean ring what suffices to prove is the equality j r 1 2 id r 1 in fact given z j r 1 one writes that z e 1 e 2 e 3 which can be handled as in theorem 2 3 above or that z e 1 e 2 e 3 which can be written as j r 1 z 2 e 2 e 1 e 2 e 3 again as above tricked z 2 e 2 2 e 2 so that z 0 2 id r 1 as expected so we finally receive the pursued description of r 1 describing r 2 here 3 j r 2 we claim that j r 2 0 in fact as in the preceding case we have that j r 2 2 id r 2 or j r 2 2 id r 2 if for any j j r 2 we write j 2 i for some i id r 2 then j 3 i i j r 2 id r 2 0 whence i 0 j symmetrically if j 2 i then j 3 i i j r 2 id r 2 0 and hence i 0 j as required furthermore since 3 0 it easily follows that x 3 x for all x r 2 and thus 7 is applicable to get the wanted description of r 2 describing r 3 here 5 j r 3 we assert that j r 3 0 and that 5 0 indeed as in the previous case for r 1 we have that j r 3 2 id r 3 if for any j j r 3 we write j 2 i for some i id r 3 then 2 j 5 i i j r 3 id r 3 0 and hence i 0 j by a reason of symmetry if j 2 i then 2 j 5 i i j r 3 id r 3 0 whence i 0 j as required furthermore as 5 0 it readily follows that x 5 x for all x r 3 however we intend to prove the more exact equations x 4 1 or x 3 x in order to do that write x e 1 e 2 e 3 or x e 1 e 2 e 3 in the first case we adapt the corresponding situation from theorem 2 3 yielding that x 4 1 under the substitution x x 1 in the second case we can assume without loss of generality that e 1 e 2 e 1 e 3 0 squaring the second equation one gets rings and linear combinations of three idempotents 9 that x 2 x 2 e 1 e 2 e 3 2 id r 3 as it is elementarily to verify that the sum e 1 e 2 e 3 is an idempotent and hence x 2 x 2 2 x 2 x this means that x 4 2 x 3 x 2 2 x 0 which under the substituting x x 1 makes sense that x 4 2 x 3 x 2 2 x 0 furthermore as already above demonstrated the two substitutions x 2 x and x 3 x in x 4 1 give nothing new while in the other valid equality x 4 2 x 3 x 2 2 x 0 they ensure that x 4 x 3 x 2 x 0 and x 4 x 3 x 2 x 0 these two equations imply in turn together that x 3 x as wanted therefore lemma 2 2 ii is now in use and we consequently obtain the desired description of r 3 as being isomorphic to z 5 the commutativity of the former ring r follows in the same way as in theo rem 2 3 above sufficiency it follows by adapting the same idea as in the sufficiency of theorem 2 3 remark 2 7 the direct product z 5 z 5 does not lie in the class r 2 whereas the direct products z 4 z 5 and z 4 z 4 z 5 still lie besides concerning the element wise presentation in these rings the crucial elements 1 4 and 2 4 having problems with their representation in 1 and 4 here work positively in fact one has that 1 4 1 0 0 0 0 1 2 4 0 0 1 0 1 1 and 1 2 4 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 curiously it seems that the classes r 1 and r 2 coincide which is somewhat a similarity with a relationship illustrated in 1 as for the sentence it is pretty easy to establish that a finite direct product of rings from the class c is also a ring from the class c stated in the proof of sufficiency of theorem 2 4 in 5 it certainly makes sense under the validation of points 1 2 and 3 there as 5 example 2 6 unambiguously showed we end our work with the following two queries problem 2 8 describe the isomorphism structure of those rings r from the class r 3 in which for each element r there are three commuting idempotents such that r e 1 e 2 e 3 or r e 1 e 2 e 3 the next statement is of general interest in the present topic problem 2 9 if every element of a ring is expressed as a finite linear combination over z of commuting idempotents is that ring necessarily commutative acknowledgement the author would like to thank the specialist referee
