wavelet approximation 1 introduction numerous applied problems lead to the need to solve various classes of singular integro di erential equations s i d e in elasticity theory ltration theory control theory and stable processes see for example 2 7 singular integro di erential equations with the cauchy kernel of the rst kind on a real segment with some boundary conditions arise by present time there are a large number of works devoted to solving this problem since the exact solution to the problem can only be found in particular cases various approximate methods are widely used to substantiate them studies are carried out in the hoelder spaces as long as at the spaces of quadratically summable functions the properties of the singular integral do not allow to use the spaces of continuous functions however the most relevant in practice are uniform error estimates in this article the authors apply a speci c approach to the study this problem which they used earlier to solve integral equations of the rst kind with a logarithmic singularity in the kernel 8 and with the cauchy kernel on the interval 5 following 9 here we propose a special pair of spaces based on the restriction of spaces of continuous functions for such spaces the well posedness of the problem is established this allows us on the basis of the general theory of approximate methods of analysis 1 4 to substantiate theoretically various approximative methods the paper proposes a general projection method with establishing conditions for its convergence and uniform error estimates since wavelet approximations have recently been of interest in this paper for the problem under consideration a wavelet collocation method is proposed with subsequent justi cation in the selected spaces its numerical implementation is carried out using a model example 2 well posedness of the problem we consider a singular integro di erential equation of the rst kind of the form ax 1 1 1 x t d 1 1 1 h t x d y t 1 t 1 1 2 with boundary conditions x 1 x 1 0 2 where x t is desired function y t and h t are given continuous functions the singular integral i i t 1 1 1 t d is understood in the sense of cauchy s principal value as the space of the required elements x we choose the space of functions x t satisfying the following conditions x t is continuously di erentiable on 1 1 satis es condition 2 and ix is continuous we provide x with the norm x x x c ix c 3 where x c max 1 t 1 x t t 1 t 2 as the space of right hand sides y we choose the space of continuous functions y t for which i y is also a continuous function we introduce the norm in y by the relation y y y c i y c 4 the spaces x and y are banach the completeness of the space y was established in 5 the completeness of the space x follows from the results obtained below further we need some properties of the characteristic operator g x y de ned by the equality gx g x t 1 1 1 x t d lemma 1 the operator g x y is linear bounded and g x y 1 proof we represent x t in the form x t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 k 1 cuk 1 uk 1 t 5 where uk t sin k 1 arccos t 1 t 2 k 1 2 are the chebyshev polynomials of the second kind and cuk 2 1 1 1 t 2 t uk t

of the k th degree we get gx k 1 k kuk 1 t 7 from the de nition of norms 3 4 representation 7 and the known relation 1 1 1 1 2 uk 1 t d tk t 8 we nd gx y gx c i gx c t k 1 k kuk 1 t c k 1 k ki uk 1 t c t k 1 k kuk 1 t c k 1 k k cos k arccos t c ix c x c therefore gx y x c ix c x x whence the statement to be proved follows lemma 2 the operator g x y is continuously invertible and g 1 1 g 1 y x proof consider the characteristic equation gx y x x y y 9 under conditions 2 the solution to equation 9 will be sought in the form of 5 and the right hand side y t will be represented as fourier series in the chebyshev polynomials of the second kind then we have k 1 k kuk 1 t k 1 cuk 1 y uk 1 t using the method of uncertain coe cients we nd k c u k 1 cuk 1 y k lobachevskii journal of mathematics 4 and therefore the solution x t of equation 9 exists for any right hand side y y and can be represented in the form x t g 1 y 1 t 2 k 1 cuk 1 y k uk 1 t 10 using 3 4 10 and 6 we obtain g

lemma follows we write down problem 1 2 in the operator form ax gx rx y x x y y 11 where rx 1 1 1 h t x d by lemma 2 equation 11 is reduced to an equation of the second kind x g 1 rx g 1 y x g 1 y x then taking into account the known result of functional analysis 4 we have lemma 3 if the linear operator r x y satis es the inequality q r 1 r x y then the operator a g r x y is continuously invertible and a 1 1 q 1 a 1 y x lemma 4 let the kernel h t be a continuous function in both the variables then for the operator r x y the estimate r x y 2 h c c holds proof given the de nitions of norms 3 4 and formula 6 we have rx y 1 t 2 1 1 1 h x d c 1 1 1 1 2 t 1 1 1 h t 1 x 1 d 1 d c 2 x c h c c 1 1 1 h 1 x 1 1 1 1 1 2 t d 1 d c 2 x c h c c lobachevskii journal of mathematics 5 1 1 1 h 1 x

t x x t 1 1 this implies 12 consequently we have rx y 2 h c c x x and therefore r x y 2 h c c lemma 5 let the kernel of r have the form h t 1 1 2 t then r x y 1 2 proof using the de nitions of norms 3 and 4 the formula for the inverse of a singular integral with the cauchy kernel on the interval 3 and relation 6 we have rx y 1 t 2 1 1 1 x t 1 2 d c 1 1 1 1 2 t 1 1 1 x 1 d 1 1 1 21 d c 1 t 2 1 1 1 x x t d t 1 2 c 1 2 x c applying the lagrange formula and taking into account the estimate 12 we obtain rx y 1 t 2 1 1 1 x t d t 1 2 c 1 2 x x 1 2 x c 1 2 x x 1 2 x x 1 1 whence the assertion of the lemma comes if the operator r x y is completely continuous then the operator g 1 r is also completely continuous then from the riesz schauder theory 4 it follows theorem 1 let r x y be a completely continuous operator and the homogeneous problem corresponding to 1 2 have only a trivial solution then the operator a g r x y is continuously invertible lobachevskii journal of mathematics 6 3 general projection method let xn x be a subspace of elements of the form xn t 1 t 2 n k 1 kuk 1 t n k 1 k sin k arccos t 13 where k r yn hn 1 y here hn is the space of algebraic polynomials of degree at most

projection operator as shown above gxn n k 1 k kuk 1 t p 2 n pn so pngxn gxn for any xn xn then equation 14 takes the form anxn gxn pnrxn pny xn xn pny yn 15 this equation written in the operator form is a system of linear algebraic equations slae with respect to unknown coe cients 1 n r theorem 2 assume that the conditions of theorem 1 are satis ed if qn a 1 r pnr xn y 1 then the operators an xn

the conditions of theorem 2 the error can be estimated by the following inequalities x x n e a 1 n pnr x x gx pngx y x x n g pnr 1 y x gx pngx y theorem 3 let the conditions be satis ed a s i d e 1 with boundary conditions 2 is uniquely solvable in the space x for any right hand side y y b the kernel of h t is such that the operator r x y is completely continuous c the operators p 2 n pn pn e

the space x with the velocity x x n x o y pny y h p tnh y c here the notation p tn means that the operator pn is applied to h t in the variable t lobachevskii journal of mathematics 7 proof we estimate the proximity of the exact operator a and its approximating operators an for any xn xn we nd axn anxn y rxn pnrxn y 1 1 1 h t p tn h t xn d y h p tnh y c xn c 2 h p tnh y c xn x here we denote by h y c the norm of the function h t in the rst variable in the space y and in the second variable in the space c then taking into consideration the conditions of the theorem we have a an xn y 0 n therefore by virtue of 1 ch 1 thrm 7 for all n n for which the inequality a 1 y x a an xn y 1 holds equation 15 is uniquely solvable in addition by hypothesis of the theorem we have y pny y 0 n therefore the approximate solutions x n t converge to the exact one x t in the norm of the space x with the velocity x x n x o y pny y h p tnh y c corollary under the conditions of theorem 3 the approximate solutions x n converge to the exact one x uniformly with speed x x n y o y pny c h p tnh y c x x n c o y pny y h p tnh y c taking into account the estimates of the approximation of a function obtained in 5 by segments of the fourier chebyshev series and lagrange interpolation polynomials in the space y for various classes of functions we can state that the methods of orthogonal polynomials collocations and subdomains are correctly applied to the problem 1 2 under consideration with appropriate theoretical justi cation and obtaining constructive error estimates that take into account the structural properties of the source data for this in the general projection method the fourier chebyshev operator the lagrange operator and subdomains respectively should be considered as
