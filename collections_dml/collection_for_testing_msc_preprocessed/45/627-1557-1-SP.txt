com abstract in this paper are considered the questions of unique solv ability and redefinition of a nonlocal inverse problem for the fredholm integro differential equation of second order with degenerate kernel in tegral condition and spectral parameter calculations of the value of the spectral parameter are reduced to solve the trigonometric equations systems of algebraic equations are obtained the singularities that arose in determining arbitrary constants are studied a criterion for unique solvability of the problem is established and the corresponding theorem is proved 1 problem statement mathematical modeling of many processes occurring in the real world often leads to the study of initial or inverse boundary value problems for ordinary dif ferential and integro differential equations integro differential equations are mathematical models of the flow of many physical processes and the operation of technical systems see for exam 1 in the cases where the boundary of the flow domain of a physical process is not available for measurements nonlocal conditions in integral form can serve as an additional information sufficiently for one valued solvability of the problem a large number of pa pers have been devoted to the study of integro differential equations see for exam 2 9 2010 mathematical subject classification 45 q 05 45 j 05 key words and phrases integro differential equation inverse boundary value problem degenerate kernel integral condition unique solvability 3 4 yuldashev in this paper we consider singularities in solving nonlocal inverse boundary value problem for the ordinary fredholm integro differential equation with degenerate kernel integral condition and spectral parameter the values of spectral parameter are calculated and for which the solvability of the inverse boundary value problem is established standard methods for solving the integro differential equation do not pass here integro differential equations with a degenerate kernel for other formulation of problems were considered in particular in 10 14 thus on a segment 0 t we consider an equation of the form 1 u t 2 u t t 0 k t s u s ds t under the following conditions 2 u t t 0 u t t dt u t 3 u 0 r where 0 t is given real number is positive spectral parameter is real nonzero parameter r const is the coefficient of redefinition t c 0 t k t s k i 1 a i t b i s a i t c 0 t b i s c 0 t here it is assumed that the nonzero functions a i t and b i s are linearly independent the question of the uniqueness of the solution of the inverse problem 1 3 reduces to the question of the triviality of solution of the homogeneous integro differential equation under the homogeneous condition u t 0 2 construction of solution of the direct boundary value problem 1 2 taking the degeneracy of the kernel into account we write the equation 1 in the following form 4 u t 2 u t t 0 k i 1 a i t b i s u s ds t by the aid of notation 5 i t 0 b i s u s ds on inverse boundary value problem 5 the equation 4 is rewritten as follows 6 u t 2 u t k i 1 a i t i t differential equation 6 is solved by the method of variation of arbitrary constants 7 u t a 1 cos t a 2 sin t t where a 1 a 2 while arbitrary constants t k i 1 i h i t 1 t h i t t 0 sin t s a i s ds i 1 k 1 t t 0 sin t s s ds in order to find the unknown coefficients a 1 and a 2 in 7 we use the first condition from 2 and there we arrive at equality 8 a 1 1 a 2 2 0 where 1 1 1 2 cos t t sin t 1 2 2 1 1 2 sin t t cos t 0 t 0 t t d t t 2 1 case 1 in 8 we assume that 9 1 2 0 then we arrive at the trivial result 0 0 i e 0 in this case the corresponding model differential equation u t 2 u t 0 has an infinite set of solutions u t a 1 cos t a 2 sin t where a 1 a 2 are arbitrary constants we calculate the values of the parameter for which 9 takes plase let be 1 1 1 2 cos t t sin t 1 2 0 for some this condition is equivalent to equation 1 2 cos t t sin t 1 0 which has solutions 10 n 1 1 n t arcsin 1 2 n 1 2 n 2 2 n t 2 n t n n where n is the set of natural numbers the formula 10 is a transcendent equation with respect to n it can be solved by the method of successive approximations n 1 1 1 n t arcsin 1 2 n 1 2 n 2 2 n t 2 n t n n 1 2 6 yuldashev or graphically x n x 1 1 n t arcsin y n n t where y n 1 2 n 1 2 n 2 2 n t 2 suppose now that for some the following equality holds 2 1 1 2 sin t t cos t 0 this condition is equivalent to the trigonometric equation tan t t 1 2 hence we obtain solutions 11 n 1 t arctan n t 1 2 n n t n n the second formula in 11 is a transcendent equation with respect to n it can be also solved by the method of successive approximations or graphically the set of all values of the parameter n defined by 11 we denote by 1 the set of all values of the parameter n defined by 10 we denote by 2 total number of parameter values n is countable since 0 t then 1 2 so the function u t a 1 cos t a 2 sin t can not be a solution of the boundary value problem 1 2 consequently the boundary value problem 1 2 does not have solutions in this case thus the following lemma is proved lemma 1 suppose that conditions 9 are fulfilled then the boundary value problem 1 2 has no solutions on the segment 0 t 2 2 case 2 suppose that 12 1 n 0 2 n 0 then for the values of the spectral parameter n 1 we construct the solution of the direct boundary value problem 1 2 by virtue of 12 from 8 we obtain that a 1 0 1 n and a 2 is an arbitrary number since the spectrum of the parameter n consists the set 1 defined by formula 11 the function 7 takes the form 13 u t n 0 1 n cos n t a 2 sin n t t taking 0 t 0 t t dt t t n k i 1 i h i t n 1 t h i t t 0 sin t s a i s ds i 1 k 1 t t 0 sin t s s ds into account we on inverse boundary value problem 7 transform the expression 13 14 u t n a 2 sin n t

than k different roots we denote them by m 1 m k then n m are called the characteristic numbers eigenvalues of the kernel of the integro differential equation 1 for other values n m solutions of sae 15 are written in the form i a 2 1 i n 1 n n 2 i n 1 n i 1 k where 1 i n 1 n h 11 n h 1 i 1 1 n h 1 i 1 n h 1 k n h 21 n h 2 i 1 2 n h 2 i 1 n h 2 k n hk 1 n hk i 1 k n hk i 1 1 n hkk while the determinant 2 i n differs from 1 i n that the column i in it is replaced by b i substituting values of i from last expression into 14 8 yuldashev we derive 17 u t n a 2 sin n t n k i 1 1 i n 1 n i t n n k i 1 2 i n 1 n i t 0 t in order to uniquely determine a 2 we use the second condition in 2 a 2 m 1 n t n m 2 n t n m 1 n t n where m 1 n t n sin n t n k i 1 1 i n 1 n i t m 2 n t n n k i 1 2 i n 1

m 1 n t n w 1 n t n m 2 n t n m 1 n t n m 2 n t n m 1 n t n the uniqueness of the solution of the boundary value problem 1 2 fol lows from that for 0 and 0 it takes place u t n 0 for all t 0 t and 1 thus the following lemma is proved on inverse boundary value problem 9 lemma 2 let be conditions 12 are fulfilled then on the segment 0 t for all values of parameter n 1 the boundary value problem 1 2 has a unique solution in the form of 18 if condition 16 is fulfilled 2 3 case 3 we assume that 19 1 n 0 2 n 0 then for the values of the spectral parameter n 2 we construct the solution of the direct boundary value problem 1 2 by virtue of condition 19 from 8 we obtain that a 1 is an arbitrary number and a 2 0 2 n since the spectrum of the parameter n consists of the set 2 defined by formula 10 function 7 in this case takes the form 20 u t n a 1 cos n t n k i 1 i i t n 2 t where i t h i t sin n t 2 n t 0 h i t t dt h i t i 1 k 2 t 1 t sin n t 2 n t 0 1 t t dt 1 t substituting 20 into 5 we arrive at the system of algebraic equations sae 21 i n k j 1 j p i j a 1 i n c i i 1 k where p i j t 0 b i s j s ds i t 0 b i s cos n s ds c i t 0 b i s 2 s ds sae 21 is uniquely solvable for any

of the degree at most k the equation 3 n 0 has at most k different roots we denote them by m 1 m k then n m are the characteristic numbers of the kernel of the integro differential equation 1 for other values n m the solutions of sae 21 are written in the form 23 i a 1 3 i n 3 n n 4 i n 3 n i 1 k 10 yuldashev where 3 i n 1 n p 11 n p 1 i 1 1 n p 1 i 1 n p 1 k n p 21 n p 2 i 1 2 n p 2 i 1 n p 2 k n pk 1 n pk i 1 k n pk i 1 1 n pkk while the determinant 4 i n differs from 3 i n that the column i in it is replaced by c i substituting 23 into 20 we obtain 24 u t n a 1 g 1 n t n g 2 n t n where g 1 n t n cos n t n k i 1 3 i n 3 n i t g 2 n t n 2 t n k i 1 4 i n 3 n i t in order to uniquely determine a 1 we use the second condition in 2 then from 24 we obtain a unique solution of the boundary

uniqueness of the solution of the boundary value problem 1 2 fol lows from 25 that for 0 and 0 it takes place u t n 0 for all t 0 t and 2 thus the following lemma is proved lemma 3 let be conditions 19 are fulfilled then on the segment 0 t for all values of parameter n 2 the boundary value problem 1 2 has a unique solution in the form of 25 if condition 22 is fulfilled 2 4 case 4 suppose that 26

we assume that 0 and 0 then it follows from 34 that u t n 0 for all n 3 t 0 t hence implies uniqueness of the solution of the boundary value problem 1 2 in this case thus the following lemma is proved lemma 4 let conditions 26 are fulfilled then on the segment 0 t for all values of the parameter n 3 the boundary value problem 1 2 has a unique solution in the form of the function 34 if condition 32
