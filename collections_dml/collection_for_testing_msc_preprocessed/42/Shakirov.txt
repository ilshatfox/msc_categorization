street 28 naberezhnye chelny 423806 russia received abstract the lebesgue constant corresponding to the classical fourier operator is approxi mated by a logarithmic function depending on two parameters the difference between the lebesgue constant and this function is studied various extreme problems are considered algorithms of successive reduction of values of the obtained best uniform approximations are given 2010 mathematical subject classification 42 a 10 keywords and phrases fourier operator norm best approximation two way evaluation of lebesgue constant extreme problem 1 introduction the classical fourier operator sn c 2 c 2 is related to the lebesgue constant ln sn c 2 c 2 2 2 0 sin 2 n 1 t sin t dt n n l 0 1 1 according to the fundamental inequality x snx c 2 1 ln en x x x t c 2 x t c 0 2 x 0 x 2 this constant directly affects the uniform convergence rate of the partial sums sn x t to the initial function x t the known asymptotic behavior of the constant 1 in the form ln o lnn n was specified in 1910 year by l fejer 1 who obtained the inequality ln l n 4 2 lnn o 1 n 2 with the asymptotically exact coefficient 4 2 where o 1 is undefined but bounded value since then a lot of mathematicians engaged in the study of properties of the fourier operator and refinement of the formula 2 as well as the estimate of the constant from above from below and from both sides we mention the works of g szego 2 g watson 3 g hardy 4 a n kolmogorov 5 s m nikolskii 6 s b stechkin 7 p v galkin 8 and g i nathanson 9 which are related to the topic of the presented work from these papers one can see that the estimates of ln have been consistently improving the problem of finding the asymptotic value of the constant o 1 0 was solved where 0 1 270353241 is the well known watson constant 3 however problems of the best possible approximate replacement of the lebesgue constant with a logarithmic function in the form ln 4 2 ln n a b n n a b 0 1 0 2 3 e mail iskander tatngpi ru 2 shakirov and of estimating the corresponding error term as well as the solution of extreme problems related to 3 including establishing algorithms to improve best approximation values were not considered in the literature some of these questions were solved in the recent papers of the author 10 11 there the problem of monotonic behavior of the error function residual term of the argument n on a b def ln 4 2 ln n a b n n a b 0 1 0 2 4 was studied for various choices of the parameters a b in the domain the results imply that outside the domain the solution of the problem 3 on the best approximation of ln does not exist for a 0 1 2 in the domain 0 1 2 0 2 the error function 4 strictly decreases 11 for arbitrary values of the second parameter b 0 2 which means on a b m in the domain a 1 0 2 a 0 51188859 see 11 the function 4 strictly increases 10 which means on a b m m and m stand for the classes of strictly decreasing and strictly increasing functions in the form 4 respectively in the mentioned works the following extreme problems were solved n def inf a b sup n n ln 4 2 ln n a b 0 00065453 5 n def inf a b sup n n ln 4 2 ln n a b 0 00094522 6 which remained relevant problems of the theory on function approximation it is clear that the best approximations functionally depend on domains and the set of natural numbers n a natural question arises is it possible to reduce the values n n by varying their arguments it the present work 1 the expediency of applying a shift a translation a of the argument of the logarithmic function n in approximate equality was justified strictly 2 the domain a 1 0 2 in the problem 6 was expanded to the domain a 1 0 2 a 0 51089714 in which the value of the best approximation was reduced to 0 00081229 see 20 21 3 the problems 5 6 were considered in nested into each other subsets of the set n and thus the values were significantly reduced 2 auxiliary results we give the definitions of the classes of functions v and v which we will use in studying the behavior of the residue term 4 and during the proof of lemmas and theorems of the paper definition 1 strictly monotonic function n n d d n of discrete argument having a small change in the range of values r is called a function with a small variation the class of such functions we denote by v where the plus sign is used if the function increases in the domain d while minus is used in the case of decrease here sup n n d inf n n d further we give the results corresponding to the class m of strictly decreasing residue terms in the form 4 lobachevskii

parameters a 0 5 b 1 27100777 and besides 0 00065453 in other words the pair a b is the only solution of the problem 5 in m proofs of the lemmas the result of lemma 1 directly follows from the formulas 16 and 17 of the paper 11 taking into account that the continuously differentiable function 8 strictly decreases as a 4 2 1 a a 0 1 2 from lemma 1 we easily obtain that the inequalities 9 and 10 hold lemma 3 is an analogue of theorem 3 in 11 the lemmas are proved remark 1 the best in the class m optimal two sided estimate 9 a is two orders more better than the estimate 10 because for the ratio of the corresponding variations we have 0 1 2 0 16563788 0 00130906 126 5 b is more than two hundred times more better than known two sided estimates from the papers 8 12 p 258 13 p 183 now we recall some notation and results from the paper 10 corresponding to the class m a 0 5 0 5 0 51188859 3 exp 2 7 1 1 0 02377719 11 lemma 4 the values of the parameter a from the interval a 1 correspond

form 4 the best uniform approximation of the lebesgue constant is attained only for the following values of the parameters a 0 51188859 b 1 26940801 and besides 0 00094522 in other words the pair a b is the only solution of the problem 6 proofs of the lemmas the result of lemma 4 follows from the formulas 21 and 22 of the paper 10 the continuously differentiable by parameter a function 13 strictly increases in the domain a 1 because a 4 2 1 a 0 a a 1 hence the minimum value of a is attained for a a and the maximum value is attained for a 1 which proves the fact that lemma 5 is true the corresponding values of the variations a and 1 like in the case of remark 1 can be used to compare the quality of the randomly selected optimal estimate from 12 for example the best in the class m optimal estimate 14 about 61 times better than its worst analogue 15 1 a 0 11528408 0 00189044 60 9 the results of lemma 6 are fully consistent with the results of theorem 1 3 10 the lemmas are proved remark 2 the results of the above lemmas convincingly prove the expediency of using the shift a of the argument of the logarithmic function in the approximate equality 3 from the results of the main lemmas 3 and 6 it follows that the domain of definition 0 1 0 2 of the error function 4 consists of a union of three disjoint areas where and 1 2 a 0 2 16 only in the small area the error function on a b has an undefined behavior either strictly increases or strictly decreases or is a function of the general form in the next section we will slightly clarify this situation 3 the main results it seems clear that the extreme values 5 6 can be reduced the following ways by extending the domains of definition of functional dependencies n n to some areas at the same time preserving their monotonic behavior by restricting their second arguments to chosen subdomains nk k k 1 k 2 k 3 of the set of natural numbers n further we will apply both of these approaches in order to prove that the lebesgue constant ln in 3 can be approximately replaced by a logarithmic function with any predetermined accuracy lobachevskii journal of mathematics 5 3 1 extreme problems in the class m based on the scheme of the proof of lemma 3 see theorem 2 and lemma 3 11 we can claim that in the extreme problem 5 the extension of to the domain preserving the strict decrease of the error function on a b does not seem to be possible therefore we will consider the problem 5 in nested into each other subsets n 1 n 2 n 3 nk of the set n for example in n 3 3 4 5 6 the first three values of the lebesgue constant are calculated exactly according to the formula of l fejer ln 12 n 1 2 n k 1 1 k tg k 2 n 1 n n thus l 1 1 3 2 tg 3 1 43599112 l 2 1 5 2 tg 5 1 2 tg 2 5 1 64218843 l 3 1 7 2 tg 7 1 2 tg 2 7 1 3 tg 3 7 1 77832286 in order to obtain the best possible approximate formula to calculate the other values ln n 3 we first consider the following modification of the best optimal two sided estimate 9 applied to this particular case 4 2 ln n 1 2 0 ln 4 2 ln n 1 2 l 3 4 2 ln 7 2 n n 3 n 3 17 we now construct the best approximating element for ln as a half sum of the upper and the lower estimates of the lebesgue constant in 17 while the best approximation itself will be defined as their half difference ln 4 2 ln n 1 2 b 3 n 3 b 3 1 2 l 3 4 2 ln 7 2 0 1 27047519 3 def inf a b sup n 3 ln 4 2 ln n a b 12 l 3 4 2 ln 7 2 0 0 00012195 18 so the initial value of the best approximation in the modified problem 18 was reduced by more than 5 times 3 5 3 now in the extreme problem 5 instead of n we take the subset n 25 using the modification of the estimate 9 in the form 4 2 ln n 1 2 0 ln 4 2 ln n 1 2 l 25 4 2 ln 51 2 n n 25 similarly to the previous case we get ln 4 2 ln n 1 2 b 25 n 25 b 25 1 2 l 25 4 2 ln 51 2 0 1 27033555 25 def inf a b sup n 25 ln 4 2 ln n a b 12 l 25 4 2 ln 51 2 0 0 00000231 19 here the value of the best approximation from 5 was reduced by more than 283 times 25 283 3 remark 3 the sequence of the best approximations k k n corresponding to the subsets nk n tends to zero with a sufficiently high speed see the quantities 5 18 19 which means that in 3 the lebesgue constant can be approximated by a logarithmic function with a predetermined error term lobachevskii journal of mathematics 6 shakirov 3 2 extreme problems in the class m in this case the algorithm for proving the main lemma 6 see theorem 1 2 lemma 5 10 allows extension a 1 0 2 to some domain preserving the belonging on a b m one can see that the initial domain from 6 depends on the constant a to be more precise it depends on the way of determining the constant see 11 taking into account the known 10 algorithm for its determination further we will extend to the domain a 1 0 2 a 0 51089714 a a 20 preserving in this domain the property of strict increasing of the residue term on a b the above will naturally lead to reducing of the initial value of the best approximation from 6 theorem the solution of the extreme problem def inf a b sup n n ln 4 2 ln n a b 21 in the domain 20 is attained only for the following values of parameters a a 0 51089714 and b b 1 26954009 in this case for the best approximation we have 0 00081229 proof using the well known formula of g szego 2 ln 16 2 k 1 1 4 k 2 1 k 2 n 1 m 1 1 2 m 1 n n and the equality k 1 1 4 k 2 1 1 2 we calculate an increment of the residue term 4 for a 1 2 1 see 16 on a def on 1 a b on a b ln 1 4 2 ln n 1 a b ln 4 2 ln n a b 8 2 k 1 1 4 k 2 1 2 n 3 k m 1 2 2 m 1 ln n 1 a 2 n 1 k m 1 2 2 m 1 ln n a 8 2 k 1 1 4 k 2 1 2 k m 1 1 2 n

represented here as a sum of k pairs sk n def k j 1 1 2 n 1 k 2 j 1 1 2 1 2 n 1 k 2 j 1 2 k n n 22 in order to estimate the terms in braces from below we use the generalization of the inequality 17 from lemma 4 in 10 in the form 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 x dx 2 n 1 k 2 j 1 j 1 k k n n 23 lobachevskii journal of mathematics 7 in which still unknown parameter is defined from the condition 1 4 1 2 1 5 1 2 5 3 1 x dx in 22 n k j 1 24 slightly simplifying 24 we obtain def 3 2 exp 32 63 1 1 0 02179428 0 02377719 25 for the remaining k 1 pairs from 22 like in lemma 4 in 10 the strict inequalities 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 x dx 2 n 1 k 2 j 1 j 2 k hold further taking into account 23 we simplify the increment on a and estimate it from below on a 8 2 k 1 1 4 k 2 1 sk n ln n a 1 n a 8 2 k 1 1 4 k 2 1 k j 1 2 n 1 k 2 j 1 1 2 n 1 k 2 j 1 1 1 x dx ln n a 1 n a 8 2 k 1 1 4 k 2 1 2 n 3 k 2 n 1 k 1 x dx ln n a 1 n a 8 2 k 1 1 4 k 2 1 ln n a 2 n 3 k n a 1 2 n 1 k 0 k n n a 1 2 1 the required estimate on 1 a b on a b n n uniformly with respect to k is true if the following nonstrict inequality holds ln n a 2 n 3 k n a 1 2 n 1 k 0 k n n a 1 2 1 we solve it with respect to the parameter a n a 2 n 3 k n a 1 2 n 1 k a 1 2 1 2 k with 25 the uniform with respect to k restriction on the parameter a can be represented as a 0 5 0 5 a 1 2 1 a a 1 a 1 2 1 2 0 51089714 so in the domain a 1 0 2 there is an inequality on 1 a b on a b n n which means on a b m a b the solution of the extreme problem 21 now follows the proof of lemma 6 see theorem 1 3 10 given the strict increase in the residue term 4 in the domain which is wider than to avoid repetitions we will not give it here the theorem is proved remark 4 in the class m the advantage of the extreme problem 21 over the prob lem 6 is clearly seen from the ratio of the corresponding best approximations 0 00094522 0 00081229 1 1 lobachevskii journal of mathematics 8 shakirov remark 5 the result of the theorem gives the possibility to represent the domain of definition 16 of the error function on a b investigated here in the form 1 2 a 0 2 therefore the function 4 has undefined behavior only for the shifts a belonging to a small interval 0 5 0 51089714 now we consider the extreme problem 6 in subsets of the set n for definiteness we choose n 3 n and consider the problem corresponding to this case 3 def inf a b sup n n 3 ln 4 2 ln n a b for the purpose of subsequent approximate calculation the values of the constants ln n 3 we use the following modification of the best optimal two sided estimate 14 4 2 ln n a l 3 4 2 ln 3 a ln 4 2 ln n a 0 n n 3 similarly to the previous paragraph 3 1 for the best approximating element and the best approximation itself we obtain the formulas ln 4 2 ln n a b 3 n 3 b 3 1 2 l 3 0 4 2 ln 3 a 1 26978804 3 def inf a b sup n 3 ln 4 2 ln n a b 12 0 4 2 ln 3 a l 3 0 00056520 26 thus in the modified extreme problem 26 the initial value of the error term was reduced more than one and a half times 3 0 00094522 0
