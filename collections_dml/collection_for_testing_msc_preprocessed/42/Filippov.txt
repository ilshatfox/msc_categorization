series with integer coe cients by systems of contractions and shifts of one function v i filippov 1 1 saratov social economic institute branch of plekhanov russian university of economics 89 radishcheva str saratov 410003 russia abstract in the spaces lp 0 1 1 p we investigate the systems consisting of contrac tions and shifts of one function we study fourier type series expansions with integer coe cients by such systems the resulting decompositions have the property of image compression that is many their coe cients vanish this study may also be of interest to the specialists in transmission and processing of digital information 2010 mathematical subject classi cation 42 c 40 42 a 16 keywords and phrases functional systems contractions and shifts of a function lp spaces fourier type series with integer coe cients digital information processing digital information transmission the author continues the research published in 1 5 systems consisting of contractions and shifts of one function have become interesting for researchers with the advent of results on wavelets and frames in this paper we construct decompositions in the lp spaces directly by a given system consisting of contractions and shifts of one function the proposed algorithm allows one to obtain a decomposition with a large number of zero coe cients and at the same time to some extent is optimal when approximating with a xed accuracy the algorithm also admits a signi cant inaccuracy of intermediate calculations these inaccuracies are corrected in further calculations the possibility of uniform approximation of continuous functions with any accuracy by polyno mials with integer rational coe cients on a segment of the real axis has been studied since 1914 in the works of i pal kakeya m fekete i n khlodovsky s n bernshtein l v kantorovich and others the author of the paper 6 continues these studies and formulates some results of the above authors and other researchers on this problem the existence of a sequence of trigonometric polynomials with integer not necessarily positive coe cients that converges to zero almost everywhere follows from 7 recently there has been a certain interest in decompositions in a series with integer coe cients thus 8 gives a result on the existence of a sequence of trigonometric polynomials with integer positive coe cients that converges to zero almost everywhere the papers 9 10 also consider systems of contractions and shifts of one function but the expansion coe cients are found almost like the fourier coe cients the coe cients tend to zero and are slightly di erent than in this paper here we consider functional systems of the form k j k bkt j l k 0 1 2 j 0 1 bk 1 l bk j b n b 1 k 0 k 0 1 here t is an arbitrary function from lp 0
