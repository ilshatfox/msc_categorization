university moskovskaya 36 kirov russia received october 17 2018 abstract denote by r the semifield with zero of nonnegative real numbers with operations of max addition and multiplication let x be a topological space and c x be the semiring of continuous nonnegative functions on x with pointwise operation max addition and multiplication of functions by a subalgebra we mean a nonempty subset a of c x such that f g fg rf a for any f g a r r we consider the lattice a c x of subalgebras of the semiring c x and its sublattice a 1 c x of subalgebras with unity the main result of the paper is the proof of the definability of the semiring c x both by the lattice a c x and by its sublattice a 1 c x 2010 mathematical subject classification 06 b 05 16 s 60 54 h 99 keywords and phrases semiring of continuous functions subalgebra lattice of subalgebras isomorphism hewitt space max addition 1 introduction the present paper belongs to the direction of mathematics that studies interconnections between topological spaces and associated algebraic systems of continuous functions departure notions by a semiring we mean an algebraic system s 0 1 in which s 0 is a commutative monoid with neutral element 0 s 1 is a monoid with neutral element 1 multiplication is distributive with respect to addition on both sides and 0 a a 0 0 for all a s a commutative semiring that is not a ring and every nonzero element of which is invertible is called a semifield with zero it is easy to show that if s is a semifield with zero then ab a b 6 0 for any a b s 0 therefore the set s 0 with the same operations of addition and multiplication forms an algebraic system which is called a semifield let s be the field r of real numbers or the semifield with zero r of non negative real numbers or the semifield p of positive real numbers with the interval topology let c x s denote the set of continuous s valued functions with point wise operations of addition and multiplication of functions defined on an arbitrary topological space x then c x c x r is a ring c x c x r is a semiring and u x c x p is a semifield the ring c x is an algebra over r a subalgebra of c x is any nonempty subset that is closed under addition and multiplication of functions and under multiplication by constants from r by analogy we call a nonempty subset a c x s a subalgebra if f g fg rf a for any f g a and any r s thus we are using the term subalgebra in a wider sense than a ring that is simultaneously a vector space let a c x s denote the lattice of subalgebras of c x s with respect to inclusion and let a 1 c x s denote its sublattice of subalgebras with unity strict inclusion is denoted by it is easy to show that the infimum a b of subalgebras a and b is their intersection a b and the supremum a b consists of functions equal to finite sums of products of the form f 1 fn e mail sedoy vadim mail ru 2 sidorov where f 1 fn a b n n since a and b are subalgebras we can assume without loss of generality that n 2 if 0 s then sometimes a b therefore we regard the empty set as an element of the lattice a c x s its zero for any a b r we put a b max a b and a b min a b if for r and p usual addition replaced by max addition we get the semifield with zero r and the semifield p for the semiring c x c x r and the semifield u x c x p the notions of a subalgebra and a lattice of subalgebras with unity are defined as above a hausdorff space x is called a tikhonov space if for any nonempty closed set f x and any point x x f there exists a function f c x or which is equivalent f c x such that f f a and f x b for some a 6 b tikhonov spaces are up to homeomorphism subspaces of tikhonov powers of r a topological space x is called a hewitt space or real complete or functionally closed if it is homeomorphic to a closed subspace of some tikhonov power of the space r for example any compactum is a hewitt space main results suppose that with every topological space x an algebraic structure a x is somehow associated this correspondence is assumed to be invariant that is to homeomorphic spaces there correspond isomorphic structures the situation when the converse is true is described by the following definition we say that a topological space x k is defined uniquely up to homeomorphism in a class k of topological spaces by an algebraic structure a x if for an arbitrary topological space y k an isomorphism a y a x implies a homeomorphism y x the notion of definability of an algebraic structure a x in a class k of topological spaces by a derived algebraic structure a x is introduced in a similar fashion in 1939 gel fand and kolmogorov proved see 1 theorem 2 one of the first definability theorems for topological spaces an arbitrary compactum x is defined by the ring c x in 1948 hewitt established see 2 theorem 57 the definability of an arbitrary hewitt space x by the ring c x and in 1997 vechtomov proved see 3 theorem 1 the definability of x by the lattice a c x of subalgebras of the ring c x a systematic study of semirings and semifields of continuous functions began in 1998 see 4 in their study great attention is devoted to methods and results that can be transferred from theory of rings of continuous functions icluding those related to definability it is natural to assume spaces under these considerations to be hewitt spaces since the following proposition is true see 5 theorems 3 9 and 8 7 proposition 1 for an arbitrary space x there exist a thikhonov space x and a hewitt space x for which the rings c x c x and c x are canonically isomorphic and therefore so are the corresponding semirings and semifields as with the usual addition and with max addition in work 6 we proved the definability of an arbitrary hewitt space x by each of the lattices a u x and a 1 u x and also showed that for any topological space x these lattices define the semifield u x the following theorems are the main results of the present paper theorem 1 any hewitt space x is defined by each of the lattices a c x and a 1 c x theorem 2 for any topological space x the semiring c x is defined by each of the lattices a c x and a 1 c x theorem 2 follows from theorem 1 indeed by proposition 2 any isomorphism of the lattices a c x and a c y implies an isomorphism of the lattices a 1 c x and a 1 c y and therefore of the lattices a 1 c x and a 1 c y canonically isomorphic to them see propo sition 1 hence x y by theorem 1 therefore c x c x c y c y we proceed to the proof of theorem 1 in view of proposition 1 all the spaces considered in what follows are assumed to be tikhonov spaces lobachevskii journal of mathematics determinability of semirings c x 3 2 the subalgebra r the smallest subalgebra of the semiring c x containing a function f is said to be one generated and denoted by f let f denote the smallest subalgebra with unity of the semiring c x that contains a function f clearly f f r and f a 1 f anf n a 1 an r n n f a 0 a 1 f anf n a 0 a 1 an r n n 0 functions of subalgebras f and f we write polynomials with increasing powers of f the coefficients of polynomials be denoted by the letters a b c d and r often with indices for an arbitrary function f c x denote by z f and coz f the sets z f x x f x 0 pos f x x f x 0 denote by ez the function f c x such that f 0 on z and f 1 on x z for some subset z x in particular e 1 we say that in a lattice there is a lattice characterization of some property if this property can be described in terms of this lattice for example since the subalgebra r is the zero of the lattice a 1 c x it follows that there is a lattice characterization of the subalgebra r in a 1 c x a nonzero element a of a lattice with zero is called an atom if b 0 for any element b a a lattice characterization of subalgebras ez in the lattice a c x is given by lemma 1 subalgebras ez are exactly atoms of the lattice a c x proof let a be an atom of the lattice a c x that is a be a minimal subalgebra we choose nonzero function f a then f f 2 a since a is a minimal subalgebra it follows that f f 2 a therefore f f 2 and f has the form f a 1 f 2 an f 2 n therefore 1 a 1 f anf 2 n 1 on pos f 6 that is f a on pos f for some a 0 thus a f ez where z pos f conversely let a ez since ez e i z for all i n it follows that any nonzero function f ez has the form aez a 0 thus f ez that is ez is a minimal subalgebra lemma 2 for any subalgebra ez the following conditions are equivalent 1 ez r 2 if ez 6 ez and ez ez ez then ez ez or ez ez proof 1 2 let ez r consider subalgebras ez 6 ez and ez such that ez ez ez since ez 1 and e i z ez for all i n it follows that a function ez has the form a bez if a 0 then ez a 0 that is ez 1 if a 0 then b 1 that is ez ez 2 1 assume condition 2 holds but ez 6 r in particular z x put z x z and z then ez 6 ez ez and ez ez ez since ez ez ez a contradiction with condition 2 thus ez r from lemma 2 we obtain proposition 2 in the lattice a c x there is a lattice characterization of the subalgebra r and therefore of the sublattice a 1 c x remark 1 by proposition 2 for the proof of theorem 1 we can restrict ourselves to the case of the lattice a 1 c x therefore until the end of this work we will work in the lattice a 1 c x and the subalgebras with unity we will be call subalgebras lobachevskii journal of mathematics 4 sidorov 3 subalgebras f for an arbitrary function f c x denote by max f and min f the sets max f x x f x sup f min f x x f x inf f lemma 3 for any subalgebras f g f and any points x y x we have 1 if f x f y then g x g y 2 if g x g y then f x f y in particular im g im f 3 if f g and f g 6 r then z f z g 4 if f g then im f im g 5 if f g 6 r then max f max g and min f min g 6 if f x g x 1 and g a 0 a 1 f anf n then a 0 a 1 an 1 7 if f x 1 and f a 0 a 1 f anf n then f a 0 for f 1 or a 1 1 8 a 0 a 1 f anf n m am 0 am 1 fm amn f nm proof since g f it follows that a function g is presented as g a 0 a 1 f anf n 1 moreover for any i 1 and any a 0 the inequalities f x f y and af i x af i y are equivalent therefore statements 1 and 2 are true 3 let f g and f g 6 r in particular a 1 an 0 for any i 1 and any a 0 z af i z f therefore by 1 we obtain that z g z f similarly z f z g thus z f z g 4 if f g then g f and f g now by statement 2 we obtain that im f im g summing statements 1 and 2 we get statement 5 statements 6 and 8 are trivial 7 let f x 1 and f a 0 a 1 f anf n then a 0 a 1 an 1 if 0 f y 1 and a 1 1 then f y a 1 f y anf n y that is f y a 0 we now resolve the question of equality of subalgebras f lemma 4 for any subalgebras f and g are different from r we have 1 if im f 2 then f g if and only if im g 2 max f max g z f z g 2 2 if im f 2 then f g if and only if f rg for some r 0 proof 1 let im f a b a b 0 if f g then by statements 3 5 of lemma 3 condi tion 2 holds conversely assume condition 2 holds then im g c d for some c d 0 where f 1 a g 1 c f 1 b g 1 d b 0 d 0 we can assume without loss of generality that a c 1 if b d 0 then f g that is f g if b d 0 then consider m n n such that bm d and dn b therefore f b gn g and g d fm f thus f g and g f that is f g 2 let im f 2 if f g then im f im g by statement 4 of lemma 3 since f g and f g f u g and g v f for some polynomials u g a 0 a 1 g ang n v f b 0 b 1 f bmf m 3 therefore f u v f u v f c 0 c 1 f ckf k c 1 a 1 b 1 4 lobachevskii journal of mathematics determinability of semirings c x 5 we can assume without loss of generality that 1 g x f x f y f z for some x y z x 5 then by statement 6 of lemma 3 from 3 4 and 5 we obtain that a 0 a 1 an b 0 b 1 bm c 0 c 1 ck 1 if c 1 1 then by statement 7 of lemma 3 from 4 we obtain that f y f z c 0 a contradiction with f y f z therefore c 1 1 since a 1 b 1 1 it follows that a 1 b 1 1 thus by 3 we obtain that f u g g and g v f f that is f g converse is obvious denote by a 1 f the lattice of subalgebras a f lemma 5 for any subalgebra f we have 1 im f 1 if and only if a 1 f 1 2 im f 2 and z f if and only if a 1 f 2 3 im f 2 and z f 6 if and only if a 1 f 3 4 im f 3 if and only if a 1 f in particular there is a lattice characterization of the inequality im f 3 proof it suffices to prove the implications 1 obviously if im f 1 then a 1 f r 2 3 let im f 2 if g 6 r and g f then im g 6 1 max f max g and im g im f by statements 2 and 5 of lemma 3 in particular im g 2 assume that z f then z g since g 6 r and g f therefore f g by lemma 4 thus the lattice a 1 f is the two element chain r f assume that im f a 0 for some a 0 by lemma 4 if z g then g a 2 f and if z g 6 then f g moreover a 2 f f since a 2 f f and a 2 f 6 f by lemma 4 thus the lattice a 1 f is the three element chain r a 2 f f 4 let im f 3 then f 2 n fn for all n n since f 2 n fn 2 fn and f 2 n 6 fn by lemma 4 thus the lattice a 1 f is infinite the lattice a 1 c x is complete since every nonempty family ai i i of its elements has an infimum the intersection of subalgebras of the family and a supremum the subalgebra consisting of all possible finite sums of functions of the form f 1 fn where f 1 fn i i ai n n an element a of a complete lattice is said to be compact if for any nonempty family ai i i of its elements a i i ai implies a i j ai for some finite subset j i an element a of a lattice is said to be indecomposable if the fact that a b c for some elements b and c of the lattice implies a b or a c we give a lattice characterization of the subalgebras f proposition 3 the subalgebras f are exactly indecomposable compact elements of the lattice a 1 c x proof let f i i ai for some family of subalgebras ai i i then there exist subalgebras ai 1 aim m n and functions f 1 fn ai 1 aim n n such that f r f 1 fn thus f ai 1 aim that is any subalgebra f is a compact element prove that any subalgebra f is a indecomposable suppose the opposite that is f a b for some subalgebras a b f then subalgebras r a b and f are distinct thus im f 3 by lemma 5 since a 1 f 4 since f a b it follows that a function f has the form f a 1 u 1 f v 1 f anun f vn f 6 lobachevskii journal of mathematics 6 sidorov where u 1 un a r f v 1 vn b r f we can assume without loss of generality that 1 ui f x vi f x f x f y f z for some x y z x and any i 1 n 7 since 1 f y f z by statement 7 of lemma 3 from 6 we obtain that a polynomial ajuj f vj f contains a monomial f for some j 1 n assume that uj f b 0 b 1 f bmf m vj f c 0 c 1 f ckf k 8 then aj b 0 c 1 b 1 c 0 1 moreover aj b 0 b 1 c 0 c 1 1 since from 6 7 and 8 we obtain that a 0 a 1 an b 0 b 1 bm c 0 c 1 ck 1 therefore aj b 0 c 1 1 or aj b 1 c 0 1 if aj b 0 c 1 1 then from 6 and 8 we obtain that f ajuj f vj f ajb 0 vj f vj f vj f c 1 f f whence f vj f b that is f b a contradiction with b f similarly if aj b 1 c 0 1 then f a a contradiction with a f thus a subalgebra f is a indecomposable element conversely suppose that a subalgebra a is a indecomposable compact element of the lattice a 1 c x since a f a f it follows that a f 1 fn for some f 1 fn a n n we can assume without loss of generality that n takes the least possible value if n 2 then a f 1 f 2 fn which fact by the indecomposability of a means a f 1 or a f 2 fn a contradiction with the choice of n thus n 1 4 the subalgebras ez and ez denote by ez a function 1 2 ez by lemma 4 for any subalgebra f we have f ez im f 2 z f z f ez im f 2 min f z z f 9 an element a of a lattice with zero is called a predatom if in a lattice there are exactly two elements less than a zero and an atom of a lattice from lemma 5 we obtain the following lemma 6 the subalgebras ez and ez are exactly the predatoms and the atoms of the lattice a 1 c x respectively denote by f z the restriction of a function f on z x if sets z 1 zn form a partition of a set x then we will write x z 1 zn lemma 7 for any subalgebras ez 6 ez we have x z z if and only if im f 2 for any subalgebra f ez ez 10 proof the necessity is obvious conversely assume condition 10 holds consider the subalgebra ez 2 ez 3 ezez ez ez it is easy to see that if x 6 z z then 0 1 2 3 im ez 2 ez 3 ezez 3 a contradiction with 10 thus x z z remark 2 by lemma 5 the inequality im f 2 of condition 10 is a purely lattice one from this fact proposition 3 and lemma 6 we get that lemma 10 contains a lattice characterization of subalgebras ez and ez such that x z z generally we will repeatedly encounter a situation where properties for which lattice characterizations were obtained earlier are used for a lattice characterization of some property we give a lattice characterization of subalgebras f im f lobachevskii journal of mathematics determinability of semirings c x 7 proposition 4 for any subalgebra f 6 r we have 1 im f if and only if f ez 1 ezn for some subalgebras ez 1 ezn 2 im f and z f if and only if f ez 1 ezn for some subalgebras ez 1 ezn proof 1 let im f r

inf g 0 on z a function ez f g has the form ez a 00 a 10 f a 01 g amnf mgn where a 0 i 0 for all i 0 since ez 0 on z and g 0 on z therefore ez f a 10 a 11 g a 20 f amnf m 1 gn since z ez z and inf g 0

hence f r g for some g c x r inf g therefore a function f is presented as f a 0 a 1 r g an r g n where an 0 and n 1 since f 6 r thus f r g where r a 0 a 1 r anr n g a 1 g ang n and r inf g since r inf

remark 3 and proposition 5 we obtain that it suffices to consider the case when a f spset im f lemma 13 for any sp subalgebra f im f the following conditions are equivalent 1 f bset 2 for any sp

g a 0 b 1 c 0 a 1 f amf m b 1 c 1 g 21 whence g y b 1 c 0 and b 1 c 1 1 since sup f and sup g moreover b 1 c 0 b 1 c 1 g y g y since c 0 c 1 g y and b 1 c 1 1 a contradiction thus f uset we give a lattice characterization of subalgebras f uset spset bset lemma 15 for any subalgebra f spset bset the following conditions are equivalent 1 f uset 2 if h f g where g 6 r g bset uset and h bset spset then h uset lobachevskii journal of mathematics 12 sidorov proof 1 2 let f spset bset f uset g bset uset r in particular f g 0 therefore if h bset spset and h f g then h 0 thus h uset 2 1 assume that condition 2 holds put g 1 1 1 f then 1 g 0 inf g 0 and im g since sup f thus g bset uset and g 6 r put h fg then h f g moreover h bset spset since inf f 0 h 1 on f 1 and h f on f 1 therefore h uset by condition 2 that is h 0 whence f 0 since h fg thus f uset from remark 5 and lemmas 14 and 15 we obtain following proposition 7 there is a lattice characterization of u subalgebras denote by a 1 uc x the lattice of u subalgebras it is easy to see that the correspondence x a 1 uc x a 1 u x x a 7 a 0 is an isomorphism the proof of theorem 1 see remark 1 let be an isomorphism of the latttice a 1 c x onto the lattice a 1 c y where x and y are hewitt spaces by proposition 7 the restriction of on the lattice a 1 uc x is an isomorphism of the lattice a 1 uc x onto the lattice a 1 uc y therefore the map y 1 x is an isomorphism of the lattice a 1 u x onto the lattice a 1 u y thus see 6 theorem 2 x y acknowledgments the paper was prepared within the framework of the state comission of the ministry
