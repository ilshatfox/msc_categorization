topological space this result is extended to lattices of closed subsets with respect to arbitrary closure operator on a set also we establish a one to one correspondence between closure operators which are both algebraic and topological on a given set x and pre orders on x and prove that this correspondence induces a one to one correspondence between topological algebraic t 0 closure operators on x and partial orders on x 2010 mathematical subject classification 06 a 15 06 f 30 54 h 12 keywords and phrases closure operator moore class algebraic lattice t 0 closure operator pre order 1 introduction and preliminaries a partially ordered set poset is a pair x where x is a non empty set and is a partial order a reflexive transitive and antisymmetric binary relation on x for any subset a of x and x x x is called a lower bound upper bound of a if x a a x respectively for all a a a poset x is called a lattice if every nonempty finite subset of x has greatest lower bound or glb or infimum and least upper bound or lub or supremum in x if x is a lattice and for any a b x if we define a b infimum a b and a b supremum a b then and are binary operations on x which are commutative associative and idempotent and satisfy the absorption laws a a b a a a b conversely any algebraic system x satisfying the above properties becomes a lattice in which the partial order is defined by a b a a b a b b a lattice x is called distributive if a b c a b a c for all a b c x equivalently a b c a b a c for all a b c x a lattice x is called a bounded lattice if it has the smallest element 0 and largest element 1 that is there are elements 0 and 1 in x such that 0 x 1 for all x x a partially ordered set in which every subset has infimum and supremum is called a complete lattice if l is a complete lattice and x l we write infx or x or x x x for the infimum of x and sup x or x or x x x for the supremum of x if x x 1 x 2 xn is a finite subset then we write n i 1 xi or x 1 x 2 xn for infx and n i 1 xi or x 1 x 2 xn for supx any complete lattice has the smallest element and the greatest element which are denoted by 0 and 1 respectively logically the infimum and supremum of the empty set are 1 and 0 respectively an element a 0 in a complete lattice l is called compact if for any a l a supa a supf for some finite f a a complete lattice in which every element is the supremum of a set of compact elements is called an algebraic lattice e mail bvlmaths gmail com e mail umswamy yahoo com 2 b venkateswarlu and u m swamy it is well known that any class of subsets of a set x which is closed under arbitrary intersections and finite unions gives a topology on x with respect to which the members of the class are precisely closed sets in other words a moore class on x which is closed under finite unions is precisely the class of closed subsets of x with respect to a topology on x such moore classes can be named as topological moore classes also a closure operator c on a set x satisfying the additional properties c and c a b c a c b induces a topology on x with respect which c a is the closure of a for any subset a of x for this reason such closure operators can be called as topological closure operators further the class of closed subsets of a topological space forms a complete lattice for elementary properties of posets lattices and topological spaces we refer to 1 5 2 t 0 closure operators it is proved in 6 that the lattice of closed subsets of any topological space is isomorphic to that of a t 0 topological space in this section we extend this to any given closure operator on a given set first let us recall that an extensive idempotent and inclusion preserving mapping of the power set p x into itself is called a closure operator on a set x definition 1 let c be a closure operator on a set x for any x x we write c x for c x c is called a t 0 closure operator on x if for any elements x and y in x c x c y x y example 1 recall that a topological space x is called a t 0 space if for any x y x there exists an open set containing x and not containing y or vice versa it can be easily proved that a topological space x is a t 0 space if and only if for any x y x x y x y and therefore the topological closure operator c defined by c a a the closure of a is a t 0 closure operator on x in the following we prove that for any closure operator c on a setx there exists a t 0 closure operator c defined on a suitable set y such that the moore classes mc and mc are isomorphic where mc a x c a a first we have the following definition 2 let c be a closure operator on a set x define a relation c on x by c x y x x c x c y then c is an equivalence relation on x let us consider the quotient set xc c x x x where c x is the equivalence class containing x that is c x y x c x c y let pc x xc be the natural map defined by pc x c x for all x x clearly pc is a surjection definition 3 let xc be the set constructed above corresponding to a given closure operator c on a set x define c p xc p xc by c a pc c p 1 c a c x x c p 1 c a for any a xc where pc x xc is the natural map theorem 1 for any closure operator c on a set x c is a t 0 closure operator on xc proof first we observe the following p 1 c pc c y c y for all y x 1 clearly z p 1 c pc z for all z x now let y x then x p 1 c pc c y pc x pc a for some a c y c x c a a c y x c x c a c c y c y thus p 1 c pc c y c y and hence 1 is proved lobachevskii journal of mathematics t 0 closure operators and pre orders 3 now leta xc then since pc is a surjection a pc p 1 c a pc c p 1 c a c a therefore c is extensive also c c a pccp 1 c pc c p 1 c a pcc c p 1 c a by 1 pc c p 1 c a c a therefore c is idempotent finally let a b xc then c a pc c p 1 c a pc c p 1 c b c b therefore c is inclusion preserving thus c is a closure operator on xc to prove that c is a t 0 closure operator on xc first let us prove that c c x c x for any x x since x c x we clearly have c x c c x also z c x x z c c z c x z c x and hence c x c x so that c c x c x therefore we get that c c x c x for all x x 2 also for any x and y x y p 1 c c x pc y c x c y c x y c x thus p 1 c c x c x for all x x 3 note here that on the left of 3 c x is treated as an element of xc and on the right c x is treated as a subset of x now for any c x and c y xc where x and y x c c x c c y pc c p 1 c c x pc c p 1 c c y pc c c x pc c c y by 3 pc c x pc c y by 2 p 1 c pc c x p 1 c pc c y c x c y by 1 x y c c x c y thus c is a t 0 closure operator on xc from venkateswarlu et al 7 that for any closure operator c on a set x the moore class corresponding to c is given by mc a x c a a and that mc is a complete lattice under the inclusion ordering theorem 2 let c be a closure operator on x and c be the corresponding t 0 closure operator on xc then mc mc as lattices under the inclusion orders proof we have mc y x c y y and mc a xc c a a now define f mc mc by f y pc y for any y mc where pc x xc is the natural map first note that y mc c y y c pc y pccp 1 c pc y pc c y by 1 in the above theorem 1 pc y pc y mc and hence f is well defined and clearly f is order preserving now define g mc mc by g a p 1 c a for all a mc note that a mc a c a pc c p 1 c a p 1 c a c p 1 c a by 1 in theorem 1 p 1 c a mc therefore g is well defined and clearly g is an order preserving map also for any y mc g f y p 1 c pc y y by 1 in theorem 1 and for any a mc f g a pc p 1 c a a since pc is a surjection therefore f g and g f are identities on mc and mc respectively and hence f and g are order isomorphisms thus mc mc lobachevskii journal of mathematics 4 b venkateswarlu and u m swamy theorem 3 let c be a closure operator on a set x and c be the corresponding t 0 closure operator on xc then c is a topological closure operator if and only if so is c proof suppose that c is topological then c and c a b c a c b for all subsets a and b of xc we have c pc c p 1 c pc c and therefore c next let y z x clearly we have c y c z c y z on the other hand since y z p 1 c pc y z we have pc c y z pc c p 1 c pc y z c pc y z c pc y pc z c pc y c pc z since c is topological and therefore c y z p 1 c c pc y c pc z p 1 c c pc y p 1 c c pc z c p 1 c pc y c p 1 c pc z by 1 of theorem 1 c y c z since p 1 c pc y c y and p 1 c pc z c z therefore c y z c y c z thus c is a topological closure operator on x conversely suppose that c is topological then c pc c p 1 c pc c pc let a and b be any subsets of xc since each of pc c and p 1 c are union preserving we have c a b pc c p 1 c a b pc c p 1 c a p 1 c b pc c p 1 c a c p 1 c b pc c p 1 c a pc c p 1 c b c a c b thus c is a topological closure operator on xc let us recall that a closure operator c on x is called algebraic if c y c f f y and f is finite for all y x theorem 4 a closure operator c on a set x is algebraic if and only if the corresponding closure operator c on xc is algebraic proof suppose that c is algebraic let a xc then c a pc c p 1 c a pc c f f p 1 c a and f is finite pc c f f p 1 c a f is finite now let a c a then a pc c f for some f x 1 x 2 xn p 1 c a put f pc x 1 pc x 2 pc xn then f is a finite subset of a and a pc c p 1 c f c f therefore c a c f f a and f is finite the other inclusion is trivial thus c is an algebraic closure operator conversely suppose that c is algebraic let a x and x c a then pc x pc c a pc c p 1 c pc a since a p 1 c pc a c pc a c k k pc a k is finite and hence pc x c k pc c p 1 c k for some finite subset of k of pc a let k pc a 1 pc a 2 pc an where a 1 a 2 an a put f a 1 a 2 an since pc x pc c p 1 c k we get that pc x pc y for some y p 1 c k therefore c x c y and y c p 1 c k c p 1 c pc f c f from this we get that c x c y y c f now x c x c y c c f c f and f is a finite subset of a thus c is an algebraic closure operator on x the following corollaries are immediate consequences of theorems 2 3 and 4 corollary 1 for any given topological space x there exists a t 0 space y such that the lattice of closed subsets of x is isomorphic to that of y corollary 2 for any given algebraic closure operator c on a set x there exists an algebraic t 0 closure operator c on a suitable set y such that the moore classes of c and c are isomorphic to each other lobachevskii journal of mathematics t 0 closure operators and pre orders 5 3 pre orders and closure operators in this section we establish a one to one correspondence between pre orders on a set x and closure operators which are both algebraic and topological on the set x and prove that this induces a one to one correspondence between partial orders on x and topological algebraic t 0 closure operators on x let us begin with the following definition 4 let x be a non empty set a binary relation on x is said to be a pre order on x if is reflexive and transitive an antisymmetric pre order on x is called a partial order on x as usual pre orders or partial orders are denoted by etc we write a b for a b theorem 5 let be a pre order on a set x for any a x define c a x x x a for some a a then c is a closure operator on x which is both algebraic and topological also c is a t 0 closure operator on x if and only if is a partial order on x proof clearly c p x p x is a mapping and c also for any a b p x a c a a b c a c b c c a c a and c a b c a c b therefore c is a topological closure operator on x further c a a a c a for any a x and hence c is algebraic also thus c is a closure operator on x which is both algebraic and topological next for any x and y x we have c x c y c x c y and c y c x x c y and y c x x y and y x from this it follows that c is a t 0 closure operator on x if and only if is antisymmetric also that is is a partial order on x the following is a converse of the above theorem in the sense that every algebraic and topological closure operator on x is induced by a pre order on x theorem 6 let c be an algebraic and topological closure operator on a set x for any x and y x define x c y if and only if c x c y then c is a pre order on x such that for any a x c a x x x c a for some a a also c is a partial order if and only if c is a t 0 closure operator on x proof clearly x c x for all x x also x c y and y c z c x c y c z x c z therefore c is a pre order on x since c is an algebraic and topological closure operator on x it follows that for any a x c a c f f a and f is finite n i 1 c ai a 1 a 2 an a a a c a since x c a c x c a x c a we have c a x x x c a for some a a also since c x c y x c y and y c x it follows that c is a partial order on x if and only if c is a t 0 closure operator on x the following is an immediate consequence of theorems 5 and 6 corollary 3 let x be any non empty set then c 7 c is a one to one correspondence between algebraic and topological closure operators on x and pre orders on x such that c is a t 0 closure operator if and only if c is a partial order on x lobachevskii journal of mathematics 6 b venkateswarlu and u m swamy the following is an easy verification using the definitions of algebraic closure operators and topolog ical closure operators theorem 7 a closure operator c on x is both algebraic and topological if and only if for any a x c a a a c a next we prove that any function defined from a set x into any set y induces an algebraic and topological closure operator x first we have the following theorem 8 let f x y be a function for any a x define cf a f 1 f a x x f x f a for some a a then cf is an algebraic and topological closure operator on x and cf a a x is a partition of x proof clearly cf and a f 1 f a cf a for any a x also x cf cf a f x f cf a f x f y for some y cf a f x f y and f y f a f x f y f a for some a a x f 1 f a cf a therefore cf cf a cf a further a b x f a f b f 1 f a f 1 f b cf a cf b thus cf is a closure operator on x for any a x we have x cf a x f 1 f a f x f a for some a a x f 1 f a cf a for some a a and hence cf a a a cf a thus cf is both algebraic and topological in particular x cf x x x cf x note that for any x x cf x a x f a f x for any x and y x we have f x f y cf x cf y cf x cf y and therefore any two distinct cf x s are disjoint thus cf x x x forms a partition of x the following is a converse of the above theorem in the sense that any algebraic topological closure operator c on a set x is induced by a mapping of x into a suitable set provided c a a x is a partition of x theorem 9 let c be an algebraic topological closure operator on a set x such that c a a x forms a partition of x then there exist a set y and a function f x y such that c a cf a for all a x proof since c is given to be an algebraic and topological closure operator on x we have c a a a c a for all a x recall from definition 2 that we have xc x c c x x x where c is the equivalence relation x y x x c x c y now let f x xc be the natural map given by f x c x for all x x first we observe that for any a x x c a x c a for some a a c x c a for some a a since c x c a and c a a x is a partition of x therefore we have cf a f 1 f a x x f x f a for some a a x x c x c a for some a a x x x a c for some a a x x c x c a for some a a c a lobachevskii journal of mathematics t 0 closure operators and pre orders 7 let us recall that a closure operator c on x is called a t 0 closure operator if for any x and y x c x c y x y in the following we exhibit certain equivalent conditions for cf be a t 0 closure operator where f is a given function defined on x theorem 10 the following are equivalent to each other for any function f x y 1 cf is a t 0 closure operator on x 2 f is an injection 3 cf x x for all x x 4 cf is trivial that is cf a a for all a x proof 1 2 for any x and y x we have f x f y x f 1 f y and y f 1 f x x cf y and y cf x cf x cf y and cf y cf x cf x cf y x y therefore f is an injection 2 3 for any x and y x we have y cf x y f 1 f x f y f x y x and therefore cf x x
