equation with singular coefficient the solution is obtained in the form of the fourier bessel series there are proved theorems on uniqueness existence and stability of the solution in order to prove the existence of solution of the non local problem we obtain sufficient conditions for the convergence of the series in terms of the initial values 2010 mathematical subject classification 35 l 15 35

0 x l 0 t t is rectangular domain we consider hyperbolic equation 2 bu x t utt uxx k x ux 0 1 where k 0 is given real number equation 1 belongs to the class of degenerated hyperbolic equations investigation of boundary value problems for that equations is of importance for contemporary theory of differential equations with partial derivatives the problems have numerous applications in gas dynamics magnet hydrodynamics envelope theory and other fields of science and technique the cauchy and cauchy goursat problems for equation 1 were studied first in the work 1 for all k 1 in characteristic triangle as shown in the paper 2 the problems are not well posed for k 0 and the papers 3 4 contain studies of the problems for equations of mixed type such that their hyperbolic parts coincide with equation 1 the non local problems for equation 1 with integral conditions of the first kind and second kind are studied in the papers 5 7 in the present paper we investigate the following initial boundary value problem for equation 1 in domain d with non local integral condition of the second kind for k 1 we put in the further consideration without loss of generality l 1 because equation 1 is invariant with regard to change of variables x 1 x l y 1 y l statement of the problem it is necessary to find the function u x t satisfying the following restrictions u x t c 1 d

given sufficiently smooth functions satisfying matching conditions xk 1 x x x 1 1 0 x x dx 0 xk 1 x x x 1 1 0 x x dx 0 7 the problems for differential equations where instead of classical initial and boundary value con ditions are given conditions connecting meanings of desired functions or its derivatives at inner and boundary points of domains arise in numerous branches of sciences physics chemistry biology in particular the problems with integral conditions are encountered in mathematical modeling of the thermal conductivity the transfer of moisture in capillary porous media processes in turbulent plasma the detailed study of boundary value problems with integral conditions for hyperbolic equations can be found in the works 8 10 the papers 11 13 contain investigations of problems with integral conditions for equations with singular coefficient the condition 6 contains besides an integral operator the boundary meanings of derivative of the desired function according 8 we refer this integral condition to the second kind in what follows we apply the spectral analysis in proving of uniqueness existence and stability of the solution it is built explicitly as the fourier bessel series we check its convergence in the class of regular solutions 2 uniqueness we seek particular solutions of equation 1 which do not vanish in domaind and satisfy restrictions 2 5 and 6 in the form of products u x t x x t t we substitute the product into equation 1 conditions 5 and 6 and obtain the following spectral problem for unknown function x x x x k x x x 2 x x 0 0 x 1 8 x 0 0 9 xk 1 x x x x 1 1 0 x x x dx 0 10 here 2 is the separation constant by virtue of equation 8 and condition 9 we obtain from integral condition 10 xk 1 x x x x 1 1 0 x x x dx k 1 x 1 x 1 1 2 1 0 xx x kx x dx k 1 x

local condition 10 is equivalent to two local conditions apparently this is inherent only in the equation 1 the general solution of equation 8 for k 1 is determined by formula x x k 1 x j x k 2 x y x where j y are bessel functions of the first and the second kinds of order 1 k 2 relatively and k 1 k 2 are arbitrary constants the common decision for k 1 1 k 2 0 satisfies condition 9 as a result we obtain x x x j x 1 k 2 then eigenvalue 20 1 corresponds to eigenfunction x 0 x x j 0 x we substitute this decision into condition of the third kind and deduce the following equation for the eigenvalues of problem 8 10 j j 0 11 by virtue of formula zj z j z zj 1 z see 14 p 305 equation 11 is equivalent to the following one j 3 k 2 0 according 15 p 317 the zeros of this equation have asymptotic formula n n 2 k 4 o 1 n 12 for sufficiently large n thus the problem 8 10 has the following system of eigenfunctions x 0 x x 1 k 2 j 1 k 2 0 x x n x x 1 k 2 j 1 k 2 nx n n and its eigenvalues n are zeros of equation 11 the obtained system of eigenfunctions is not orthogonal on segment 0 1 because the eigenvalue 0 is not zero of bessel function j 3 k 2 x i e it is not root of equation 11 but the subsystem of functions x n x n n is orthogonal and complete in the space l 2 0 1 with weight xk as system of eigenfunctions of spectral problem 8 9 and 11 the orthogonality follows from equality 1 0 xkx n x x m x dx 1 0 xj 1 k 2 nx j 1 k 2 mx dx 0 since n and m are the zeros of equation 11 and 1 k 2 1 this system is complete in the space l 2 0 1 by virtue of the steklov theorem 14 p 314 therefore in what follows we consider the orthonormalized system of eigenfunctions x n x n 1 2 the equations x n x enable us to consider below the following normalized orthogonal system of eigenfunctions xn x x n x x n l 2 0 1 13 the norm is defined by formula x n 2 l 2 0 1 1 0 x x 2 n x dx x x k according 16 we introduce functions un t 1 0 u x t xkxn x dx n 1 2 14 lobachevskii journal of mathematics 4 sabitov zaitseva and auxiliary functions un t 1 u x t xkxn x dx n 1 2 where 0 is sufficiently small we differentiate this equality twice with regard to variable t 0 t t and obtain by means of equation 1 u n t 1 utt x t x kxn x dx 1 uxx k x ux xkxn x dx 1 x xkux xn x dx x kuxxn x 1 1 xkuxx n x dx in addition we obtain from this equality by virtue of equation 8 1 xkuxx n x dx 2 nun

limit for 0 and obtain by means of conditions 2 5 9 11 u n t 2 nun t ux 1 t k 1 u 1 t xn 1 t 0 t 15 then we multiply equation 1 by x and integrate the product for fixed t 0 t with regard to variable x from to 1 as a result we obtain d 2 dt 2 1 u x t x dx xux k 1 u 1 0 in the obtained equality we pass to the limit for 0 and by virtue of conditions 2 5 6 conclude that d 2 dt 2 xk 1 u x t x x l lux l

2 1 k 1 1 lobachevskii journal of mathematics initial boundary value problem 5 thus ux 1 t k 1 u 1 t 1 k 1 1 cos t 1 k 1 1 sin t we substitute the last equality into 15 and obtain the following equation for determination of functions un t u n t 2 nun t p 3 cos t p 4 sin t t 0 t where p 3 p 1 xn 1 1 k 1 1 j 1 k 2 n p 4 p 2 xn 1 1 k 1 1 j 1 k 2 n the general solution of this ordinary equation

not zeros of equation 11 in order to determine the coefficients an and bn in 14 we use the initial conditions 4 un 0 1 0 x xkxn x dx n u n 0 1 0 x xkxn x dx n as a result we obtain the system an n 1 2 n 1 1 k 1 1 j 1 k 2 n bn n n 1 2 n 1 n 1 k 1 1 j 1 k 2 n we substitute these meanings of constants an and bn into 16 and find finally un t n cos nt n n sin nt 1 2 n 1 1 k 1 1 j 1 k 2 n cos t cos nt 1

equation 1 by x and integrate it for fixed t 0 t in variable x from up to 1 as a result we obtain 1 utt x dx 1 xuxx kux dx 0 or d 2 dt 2 1 u x t x dx 1 x xux k 1 u dx 0 we have from this d 2 dt 2 1 u

mathematics 6 sabitov zaitseva we find from the integral condition 6 ux 1 t k 1 u 1 t 1 0 u x t x dx the substitution of this expression into previous equality leads to ordinary differential equation

by means of method of separation of variables i e we have constructed the system of eigenvalues 13 and by means of this system and the introduced functions 14 we find their explicit form 17 by assumptions we have x x 0 then imply that n n 0 for all n n we deduce from 17 that un t 0 for all n n then for any t 0 t relation 14 implies that 1 0 u x t xkxn x dx 0 system 13 is complete in the space l 2 0 1 with weight xk hence u x t 0 almost everywhere on segment 0 1 for any t 0 t according 2 we obtain u x t c d consequently u x t 0 in d 3 existence the obtained above particular solutions 13 and 17 enable us to write a solution of problem 2 7 as the series u x t n 1 un t xn x 18 we assume that its term by term differentiation is possible and consider the following series ut x t n 1 u n

virtue of these representations the function x 1 2 f x x 1 2 x x x x k 3 2 x x x x k 2 1 x 1 2 x x k 2 has bounded variation on segment 0 because it is product of two functions of finite variation see 17 p 202 one can show analogously that function x 1 2 f x has finite variation on segment 1 then it has finite variation on segment 0 1 and as in the case of integral 3 n we obtain bound 1 1 n c 10
