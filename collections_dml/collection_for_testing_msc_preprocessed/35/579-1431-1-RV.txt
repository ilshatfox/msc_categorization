sede medelli n colombia 2 universidad san francisco de quito ecuador received xx xx xxxx abstract we analyze the gkdv equation a generalized version of korteweg de vries with an arbitrary function f u in general for a function f u the lie algebra of symmetries of gkdv is the 2 dimensional lie algebra of translations of the plane xt this implies the existence of plane wave solutions indeed for some specific values of f u the equation gkdv admits a lie algebra of symmetries of dimension grater than 2 we compute the similarity reductions corresponding to these exceptional symmetries we prove that the gkdv equation has soliton like solutions under some general assumptions and we find a closed formula for the plane wave solutions that are of hyperbolic secant type 2010 mathematical subject classification 35 q 53 keywords and phrases korteweg de vries equation lie symmetries symmetry reduction 1 introduction the generalized korteveg de vries equation gkdv is a very natural family of non linear equations that generalizes the famous korteweg de vries equation kdv this gkdv equation has been studied by several authors using an analytic 7 or lie symmetries 4 6 8 approach it depends on an arbitrary function of f u this dependence allows us to obtain some interesting results the following is the expression for the gkdv equation ut f u ux uxxx 1 we will study its lie classical symmetries and similarity reductions our analysis extends some recent results published in 8 2 lie symmetries for a general exposition of lie symmetries the reader may see 2 3 9 12 we are interested in lie symmetries of the gkdv equation 1 we assume that the function f u is smooth somewhere around zero for different values of f u we will obtain different lie algebras of symmetries later we will show that the existence of non trivial symmetries forces f u to be analytic from the expression 1 we easily deduce that the lie algebra x t 2 is an algebra of lie symmetries of 1 for any arbitrary function f u this is 1 is invariant under translations on the plane xt we are interested in knowing for which specific values of f u this equation possesses a lie algebra of dimension three or greater e mail

determining system associated to 1 it follows that x is lie symmetry of 1 if and only if it satisfies the following system of pde s u 0 4 x 0 5 u 0 6 t 3 x 7 xx xu 8 uu 0 9 2 f u x f u 3 xxu t xxx 10 t f u x xxx 11 derivation of 7 with respect to x provides us xx 0 from 8 we have that xu 0 this allows us to simplify equation 10 obtaining 2 f u x f u t 0 8 also derivation of 11 with respect to u twice provides tu f u x 0 f u x 12 hence we will consider separately the cases f u 0 and f u 6 0 2 2 case f u 0 the case f u 0 is already well known see for example 5 in such case f u is an affine function f u f 0 f 1 u we should consider two qualitatively distinct situations if f 1 0 then equation f u f 0 is a constant function equation 1 is linear it admits the infinite dimensional lie algebra of symmetries x t 2 f 0 t x 3 t t u u v x t u 13 where v x y is any solution of the linear gkdv equation vt f 0 vx vxxx 14 if f 1 6 0 the case is equivalent to the classical kdv equation it admits the 4 dimensional lie algebra of lie symmetries x t 2 f 0 t x 3 t t 2 u u f 1 t x u 15 2 3 case f u 6 0 let us now consider the case f u 6 0 first from equation 12 we obtain x 0 applying this into equation 11 yields t 0 derivation of 8 with respect to t provides tt 2 f u xt 16 since does not depend on u and we are assuming f u is not identically zero we can deduce that tt 0 xt 0 17 lobachevskii journal of mathematics symmetry reduction and soliton like solutions for the gkdv 3 we will now take equations 10 8 the solution of the set of all other equations is expressed in terms of six arbitrary constants 0 a 0 a 1 b c d 0 3 bt a 0 a 1 t bx c du 18 values of these functions can be replaced in the equation 8 obtaining an equivalent equation c du f u 2 bf u a 1 0 19 for values of parameters 0 a 0 a 1 b c d when f u is a solution to 19 we get a symmetry of 1 we note that equation 19 does not depend on parameters 0 and a 0 which correspond to trivial symmetries translations proposition 1 let us assume f u 6 0 in 1 a vector field x x t u x x t u t x t u u is a symmetry of gkdv equation if and only if 0 3 bt a 0 a 1 t bx c du for certain constant values 0 a 0 a 1 b c d and furthermore f u verifies the following differential equation c du f u 2 bf u a 1 0 2 4 generic and degenerated cases of equation 19 the general solution of equation 19 if b and d are different of zero 19 is easily calculated by variation of constants we obtain the following formula f u a 1 2 b k c du 2 b d 20 where k is an integration constant there are two degenerated cases case d 0 and b 6 0 we may assume c 6 0 in other case f u would be constant and we fall into the case of a linear gkdv equation we obtain this formula for the general solution f u a 1 2 b k exp 2 b c u 21 where k is an integration constant case b 0 we may assume d 6 0 for in other case we fall in the classical kdv equation the formula for the general solution is now f u a 1 d log c du k 22 where k is a constant of integration we may state the following proposition 2 let us assume f u 6 0 equation 1 possesses a lie algebra of lie symmetries of dimension strictly greater than two if and only if f u is a function of the form 20 21 or 22 lobachevskii journal of mathematics 4 bla zquez sanz conde marti n an interesting remark is that me may eliminate the parameters b c and d of equation 19 in doing so we obtain the following single fourth order differential equation with no parameters d 2 du 2 f u f u 0 23 proposition 3 let us assume f u 6 0 equation 1 admits a lie algebra of symmetries of dimension strictly greater than two if and only if d 2 du 2 f u f u 0 2 5 general case we can eliminate the denominators appearing in equation 23 obtaining the following expression d 2 du 2 f u f u f u f u 2 f u f u f u 3 2 f u 2 f u f u f u 4 24 it is easy to check that the general solution of this equation contains the case f u 0 and thus f u satisfies this polynomial equation if and only if equation 1 admits a lie algebra of symmetries of dimension greater than two proposition 4 equation 1 admits a lie algebra of dimension greater than two if and only if the function f u satisfies the following fourth order differential equation f u f u 2 f u f u f u 3 2 f u 2 f u f u 0 25 in the case in which the equation 23 is satisfied the lie algebra of symmetries is easily computed using proposition 1 it always yields a three dimensional lie algebra of symmetries extending that of the lie algebra of translations we may state our final result on the symmetries this result slightly clarifies that of 8 that allowed some overlapping of cases in their classification table theorem 1 let us consider equation 1 where f u is a function defined in some neighborhood of the origin it falls in exactly one of the following six cases a b 1 b 2 b 3 i b 3 ii or b 3 iii a the function f u does not satisfy equation 25 the lie algebra of symmetries is the two dimensional lie algebra of infinitesimal translations of the plane xt x t b the function f u satisfies equation 25 we have the following subcases b 1 f u 0 in such case f u is a constant function f u f 0 equation 1 is a linear pde and it admits the infinite dimensional lie algebra of symmetries x t 2 f 0 t x 3 t t u u v x t u where v x y is any solution of the linear gkdv equation vt f 0 vx vxxx b 2 f u 6 0 and f u 0 in such case f u f 0 f 1 u is an affine function equation 1 is a classical kdv equation and it admits the following 4 dimensional lie algebra of symmetries x t 2 f 0 t x 3 t t 2 u u f 1 t x u lobachevskii journal of mathematics

algebraic nature we do not state that if a gkdv equation admits an additional symmetry then it is equivalent to some of the above cases but indeed it belongs to one of the above cases by an affine change of variables in u parameters f 0 f 1 from case b 2 u 0 from case b 3 i from case b 3 ii and f 0 u 0 from case b 3 iii are eliminated then we can state that if a gkdv equation 1 admits a lie algebra of symmetries of dimension strictly greater than two then it is equivalent to one of the following cases f u lie algebra of symmetries 1 x t 2 t x 3 t t u u v x t u v satisfies 11 u x t 3 t t

that appearing in 8 in which some equivalent equations are redundantly listed 3 similarity reductions 3 1 plane wave solutions in the general case for any value of f u equation 1 is invariant by translations on the plane xt the similarity reductions obtained by this kind of symmetries are the ordinary differential equations satisfied by plane wave solutions thus let us look for solutions of 1 of the form u x t w z z x ct 26 by direct substitution we obtain the reduced equation for w c dw dz f w dw dz d 3 w dz 3 0 27 lobachevskii journal of mathematics 6 bla zquez sanz conde marti n let us take f w w 0 f d then we may integrate and obtain the differential equation d 2 w dz 2 f w cw k 28 where k is a constant of integration the dynamics of such equation is described by a classical hamiltonian system in the plane w w where w represents the derivative of w with with respect to z of energy h w w h w w w 2 2 v w 29 where the potential is given by v w cw 2 2 kw w 0 f d 30 finally by conservation of energy the equation is reduced to the first order ordinary differential equation dw dz 2 2 e cw 2 2 kw 2 w 0 f d 31 that depends on the arbitrary constants c k and e 3 2 reductions of 1 for f u f 0 u u 0 let us consider the gkdv equation 1 with f f 0 u u 0 a symmetry of this equation is a vector field of the form x x y u with 2 f 0 t x c 1 c 3 3 c 1 t c 2 2 u u 0 c 1 32 therefore characteristics equation takes the form dx 2 f 0 t x c 1 c 3 dt 3 c 1 t c 2 du 2 c 1 u u 0 33 the case c 1 0 corresponds to the plane wave solutions that have been already studied in the general case let us assume c 1 6 0 any pair of symmetries with c 1 6 0 are conjugated by a translation hence we can set without loss of generality c 2 0 c 3 0 the characteristics equation is now dx 2 f 0 t x 1 3 dt t du 2 u u 0 34 consider f 0 6 0 then from above equation we obtain the variables for the reduction u u 0 w z t 2 3 z f 0 t x 3 t 35 substituting in 1 we obtain the reduced equation 3 w dw dz z dw dz 3 d 3 w dz 3 2 w 0 36 this equation does not admit in general a quadrature as it happened with the equation for plane wave solutions however in the case 2 which corresponds to a version of the modified korteweg de vries equation widely known as mkdv we can easily integrate to obtain the following second order equation 3 d 2 w dz 2 zw w 3 k 37 lobachevskii journal of mathematics symmetry reduction and soliton like solutions for the gkdv 7 where k is a constant of integration is not difficult to check that up to some complex linear change of variable in w and z this equation is equivalent to the well known second painleve equation we have assumed so far f 0 6 0 however in the case f 0 0 characteristics equation converts into dx x 1 3 dt t du 2 u u 0 38 if we solve this equation we have exactly the same reduction as in the case f 0 6 0 obtaining the same reduced equation 36 3 3 reductions of 1 for f u f 0 e u let us consider the gkdv equation 1 with f u f 0 e u a symmetry of this equation is a vector field of the form x x y u with 2 f 0 t x c 1 c 3 3 c 1 t c 2 2 c 1 39 characteristics equation is now dx 2 f 0 t x c 1 c 3 dt 3 c 1 t c 2 du 2 c 1 40 as in the previous section the case c 1 0 corresponds to the plane wave solutions that have already been discussed in the general case let us consider c 1 6 0 again any pair of symmetries with c 1 6 0 are conjugated by a translation so we can assume without loss of generality c 2 0 and c 3 0 characteristics equation takes the form dx 2 f 0 t x 1 3 dt t du 2 41 let us assume f 0 6 0 from above equation we compute the variables for the reduction u 2 3 ln t w z z f 0 t x 3 t 42 by substituting into 1 we obtain the reduced equation 3 d 3 w dz 3 3 e w z dw dz 2 0 43 finally the case with f 0 0 provides exactly the same reduction that the case f 0 6 0 therefore we have again 43 itself 3 4 reductions of 1 for f u f 0 log u u 0 let us consider the gkdv equation 1 with f u f 0 log u u 0 a symmetry of this equation is a vector field of the form x x y u with c 2 t c 3 c 1 c 2 u u 0 44 in what follows we will suppose u u 0 0 so that the function f u is defined in a neighborhood of 0 characteristic equation takes the form dx c 2 t c 3 dt c 1 du c 2 u u 0 45 lobachevskii journal of mathematics 8 bla zquez sanz conde marti n let us remember that our equation is invariant under temporal translations then we can take c 3 0 in that case we can choose c 2 1 then characteristics equation is dx t dt c 1 du u u 0 46 it is easy to deduce u u 0 w z exp t c 1 z x 1 2 t 2 c 1 47 which substitution into 1 gives us c 1 d 3 w dz 3 c 1 ln w f 0 dw dz w 0 48 the logarithm function can be eliminated with the following change of the dependent variable w z exp y z 49 it converts into d 3 y dz 3 dy dz 3 y f 0 dy dz 3 dy dz dy 2 dz 2 1 c 1 50 the order of above equation can be reduced by one we take d dz y z p y z y z 51 to obtain a second order equation for p p 2 d 2 p d 2 3 p 2 dp d p 3 f 0 p 1 c 1 52 4 solitary waves 4 1 plane wave solutions with a single critical point and exponential decay at infinity here we will look for plane wave solutions of 1 of the form u x t w z z x ct 53 that are exponentially small at z for this analysis we rely on the hamiltonian formulation 29 of the equation for plane wave solutions of 1 we only assume f u to be continuous in a neighborhood of 0 a solution with exponential decay at z should be an homoclinic curve of the hamiltonian system 29 associated to a critical point at the origin 0 0 in the plane w w that means a solution w z w z of the hamultonian system 29 such that see for instance 1 12 2 lim z w z w z 0 0 54 in order to have critical point of 0 0 we need to take k 0 in 30 if we assume that f is continuous near 0 then we have that the function h w 1 w 2 w 0 0 f d d 55 is continuous and takes the value h 0 f 0 2 the potential is thus written as v w h w c 2 w 2 56 lobachevskii journal of mathematics symmetry reduction and soliton like solutions for the gkdv 9 in such case we may use the energy invariant to solve the equations of movement by means of the inversion of an integral obtaining z w z w 0 dw w c 2 h w 57 in the case in which w 0 is in a potential well between 0 and a single zero of v w the function w z in formula 57 corresponds to an homoclinic curve of the hamiltonian system 29 it has exponential decay to 0 at z proposition 5 let us assume that f z is positive in the interval 0 then for eachw 0 0 the formula z w z w 0 dw w 2 h w 0 2 h w gives a plane wave solution u x t w z z x h w 0 t where the function w z takes a maximum value of w 0 at z 0 has no other critical points and decays exponentially to zero as z 4 2 hyperbolic secant soliton type solutions it is well known that existence of solitons described by hyperbolic functions is typical of completely integrable equations see for instance 5 13 this is solutions of hyperbolic secant type we have found the existence of traveling wave solutions for 1 in the particular case of f u f 0 u u 0 these solitary waves are described by hyperbolic secants we found them by a direct search theorem 2 let us assume 6 0 1 2 and f u f 0 u u 0 the function u x t c asech a x c 3 t b 58 is a solution of 1 if and only if a satisfy the following system of algebraic equations a 2 1 2 a 2 0 f 0 c 3 a 2 2 0 2 u 0 c 59 a particular case of this result can be found in 11 let us discuss some remarks on theorem 2 a this equation has this kind of solutions for all 6 1 2 however it can only be considered as a physically acceptable soliton for 0 b if we suppose that 0 then for large is small and then solitons are wide otherwise for small is large and then solitons are narrow is important to note that all these solitons travel at the same speed c these results are completely valid for 1 then 2 this situation corresponds to equation kdv itself let us see some examples of hyperbolic secant soliton type solutions 1 if 1 then 2 therefore a 12 a 2 u 0 c and f 0 c 3 4 a 2 0 soliton solutions writes as u x t u 0 asech 2 a x c 3 t b 60 which is the well known 1 soliton solution for the classical kdv equation lobachevskii journal of mathematics 10 bla zquez sanz conde marti n 2 if 2 then 1 therefore a 2 6 a u 0 c and f 0 c 3 a 2 0 soliton solutions writes as u x t u 0 asech a x c 3 t b 61 that is the well known 1 soliton solution for mkdv 3 if 2 then 2 thereforea 2 4 3 2 a 2 u 0 c and f 0 c 3 2 a 2 0 then this new soliton solution writes as u x t u 0 asech 2 a x c 3 t b 62 which corresponds to a soliton of width between kdv and mkdv ones but traveling at the same speed 5 conclusions we have studied a version of the korteweg de vries equation known as gkdv this equation has been previously studied by various authors however we have extended previous analysis and obtained new results we have clarified a result of the lie algebras in addiction we have found a few differential equations satisfied by the arbitrary function f u we have proved that this equations possesses in general plane wave solutions with a single critical point with an exponential decay at infinity we have studied completely all of the similarity reductions coming from lie classical symmetries for this gkdv equation in particular we have found explicit expressions for solitons for the case of f u f 0 u u 0 where is a real and strictly positive number all of these solitons travel at the same speed but have different width depending on acknowledgments dbs acknowledges the support of universidad nacional de colombia and colciencias through projects 776
