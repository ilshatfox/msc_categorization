the problem and studying inverse problems for the equation 1 by finding the factors of the right hand side fi x y t fi x y gi t i 1 2 either depending on x y or depending on t in the two dimensional case the inverse problems of searching for unknown right hand sides were studied in 15 18 in the present work the results of 19 for the two dimensional case are transferred to the three dimensional that is for the equation 1 using the ideas of 8 14 19 a criterion is established for the uniqueness of a solution to the problem 2 6 the solution to the problem is constructed in an explicit form in the form of the sum of an orthogonal two dimensional series when substantiating the convergence of a series the problem of small denominators of two natural arguments arose for the first lobachevskii journal of mathematics 4 sabitov time which complicates the convergence of the constructed series in this regard to prove the uniform convergence of the series estimates were established on the separation of small denominators from zero which made it possible to prove the existence of a regular solution 2 uniqueness criterion for solving a problem let u x y t is a solution to the problem 2 6

t 0 10 let fi x y t 0 i 1 2 x y 0 and the conditions mn 6 0 for all m n n then all mn 0 imn t 0 and by 10 and 7 it follows that for all m n n and any t d u x y t vmn x y dxdy 0 hence since the system of functions 8 in l 2 d is complete it follows that u x y t 0 almost everywhere in d for any t by condition 2 the function u x y t is continuous on d therefore u x y t 0 in d suppose that for some m m 0 or n n 0 the expression m 0 n 0 or mn 0 0 let us assume that mn 0 0 then the homogeneous problem 2 6 where x y 0 fi x y t 0 i 1 2 has a nonzero solution umn 0 x y t cmn 0 e 2 mn 0 tvmn 0 x y t 0 cmn

sines from the formula 8 to zero on the boundary of the region the condition 6 for x y 0 also holds since umn 0 x y cos mn 0 mn 0 sin mn 0 vmn 0 x y mn 0 vmn 0 x y 0 from the construction of the function umn 0 x y t it follows that umn 0 x y t on the set q q is a solution of the equation 1 at fi x y t 0 now the question arises of the existence of zeros of expression mn for this we represent it in the form mn 1 2 mn sin mn mn where mn arcsin 1 1 2 mn it can be seen that mn 0 with respect to only if k mn mn mn k m n n 11 this equality on the basis of the expression 9 takes the form k mn 2 m p 2 n q 2 2 thus mn vanishes when is given by the formula 11 or the last inhomogeneous diophantine equation has a solution on the set of natural numbers giving the formula 11 for k m and n natural numbers we get a countable set of zeros of the expression mn thus the following criterion for the uniqueness of the solution to problem 2 6 is established theorem 1 if there exists a solution to the problem 2 6 then it is unique only when conditions mn 6 0 are satisfied for all m and n 3 existence of a solution to a problem under the conditions mn 6 0 the solution of the problem 2 6 is formally determined by the fourier series of the system of functions 8 u x y t m n 1 umn t vmn x y 12 lobachevskii journal of mathematics 8 sabitov where the coefficients are found by the formula 10 since mn is the denominator of the coefficients of the series 12 and as shown above the equation mn 0 has a countable set of zeros 10 then the problem of small denominators of a more complex structure arises than in the flat case 7 8 p 61 66 in this connection in order to justify the convergence of the series 12 in the class of functions 2 it is necessary to establish an estimate of separation from zero mn expression mn can be represented as mn 1 2 mn sin n mn mn n max n m where q m n 2 p n n 2 pq mn 1 p q n q m n 2 p n n 2 2 lemma 1 let b 6 0 if takes only rational values then there are positive constants c 0 and n 0 n 0 n such that for all n n 0 the bound mn c 0 proof there is a natural number n 1 such that for all n n 1 p q n q m n 2 p n n 2 1 then mn can be represented as mn 1 mn moreover for mn we have the estimate 3 8 p q n q m n 2 p n n 2 2 mn 1 2 p q n q m n 2 p n n 2 2 substituting mn into mn we have mn 1 2 mn sin n mn mn mn n mn since depends on n andm and takes only rational values can be represented as r s r s n r s 1 here r and s also depend on n and m note that the set of values for any values of n and m is bounded i e t pq p 2 q 2 t max p q therefore the set of values of s is bounded above s s 0 s 0 n dividing nr by s with the remainder nr ds d 0 d d 0 n 0 0 d 0 s we give the expression mn form mn 1 d 1 2 mn sin d 0 s mn mn 13 by the well known inequalities x

estimates for mn and mn it follows that mn 0 and mn 0 forn then there exists a natural number n 2 such that for all n n 2 0 mn mn 2 now by the well known inequality sinx 2 x 0 x 2 and estimates for mn and mn we have mn 2 1 2 mn mn mn 2 1 2 mn mn 2 2 c 1 0 let d 0 0 the set of values of d 0 s is limited so for n it has a lower limit of d 0 0 1 which is independent of n and m then sin d 0 s mn mn has a lower limit for n therefore there exists a number n 3 n such that for all n n 3 it follows from the equality 13 with the representation mn n mn we get mn 1 2 1 2 mn sin d 0 1 2 sin d 0 mn 1 2 sin d

conclusion of this lemma remains valid lemma 2 if accepts only irrational algebraic numbers of degree 2 and inequality holds t 2 p 2 q 2 pq 2 2 p q t max p q then there are positive constants c 0 and n 0 n 0 n such that for all n n 0 the estimate mn c 0 proof since the number is a quadratically irrational number by liouville s theorem 20 p 60 for such a number there exists a positive number depending on such that for any integers n and l n 0 the inequality ln n 2 since the set of values of is bounded the set of values of is also bounded with 0 0 where 0 inf m n the relation mn can be represented as mn 1 k 1 2 mn sin n l n mn mn note that for any n n one can find l n so that the inequality holds 8 p 63 ln 12 n lobachevskii journal of mathematics 10 sabitov by the estimates for mn

sin n l n mn mn sin 3 4 c 3 then we have mn 1 2 mnc 3 c 3 in the second case we get sin n l n mn mn 2 n l n mn mn now based on estimates for mn mn and the inequality of the liouville theorem we have 2

it is enough for us to show that the constant c 4 0 to do this we determine the number from the inequality of the liouville theorem in terms of since is a quadratically irrational number it is the root of a second degree polynomial with integer coefficients x 2 2 0 based on the results of 8 p 65 66 where the formula for calculating in terms of the polynomial coefficients is obtained we have 1 2

mathematics initial boundary problem 11 the obtained relation is equivalent to the inequality from the conditions of the lemma then we get mn 1 2 mn c 4 n mn c 4 n n 1 mn c 4 n c 4 c 5 0 then the inequalities obtained imply the lemma for all n n 0 where n 0 n 4 c 0 min c 3 c 5 remark 2 since depends on n and m what should be the given problems p and q so that takes only rational or only irrational algebraic values let the relation q p be rational in this case without loss of generality we can assume that p and q are integers and they are coprime then can be rewritten as q 1 q m pn 2 q n m q 1 q p 2 q 0 n m q q p 2 n m 2 q n m by virtue of theorem 310 21 p 308 the square roots of and take rational values only when m a 2 b 2 p n 2 abq n a 2 b 2 q m 2 abp where a b 0 a b 1 and from the natural numbers a and b one of them is even and the other is odd 0 q a 2 b 2 p 2 ab from these statements it follows that there are countable sets of values n m p and q for which the roots and 0 take only rational values if these conditions are violated then the roots and 0 are algebraic numbers of degree 2 therefore if the product a t is a rational number then takes rational values under the conditions for n m p and q and if these conditions are violated irrational algebraic values lemma 3 let be an algebraic number of degree k 1 or k 2 then for all n n 0 the estimates umn t c 6 n mn 1 mn
