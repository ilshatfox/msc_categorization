of dar es salaam abstract in this paper we prove some fixed point theorems for f contraction mappings in partial metric spaces in par ticular the main results generalizes a fixed point theorem due to wardowski 8 in which f contraction was introduced as a generalization of banach contraction principle an illustrative example is provided to validate the results keywords partial metric spaces f contraction mappings fixed point theorem 2010 mathematics subject classification 47 h 10 54 h 25 1 introduction the notion of f contraction mappings was introduced by wardowski 8 as a generalization of banach contraction 5 and proved to be very useful in the existing metric fixed point theory this gave rise to numerous fixed point results for f contraction mappings as extension and its generalizations wardowski 8 introduced an f contraction mapping and defined it as follows definition 1 1 8 let m d be a metric space a mapping t m m is said to be an f contraction on m if there exists 0 such that for all x y m d t x ty 0 f d t x ty f d x y 1 1 and f r r a mapping satisfying the following conditions f 1 f is strictly increasing that is for all x y r such that x y f x f y f 2 for each sequence n n 1 of positive numbers lim n n 0 if and only if lim n f n f 3 there exists k 0 1 such that lim 0 kf 0 we denote the set of all functions satisfying the conditions f 1 f 3 by f remark 1 2 from f 1 and the contractive condition 1 1 we observe that every f contraction is neces sarily continuous sholawilgis gmail com drsengar 2002 gmail com gkakiko yahoo co uk 1 2 luambano et al the following example is one amongst the examples of f contractions example 1 3 7 let f r r be defined by f ln it is clear that f satisfies f 1 f 3 for any k 0 1 each mapping t m m satisfying d t x ty 0 f d t x ty f d x y is an f contraction such that d t x ty e d x y for all x y m t x 6 ty obviously for all x y m such that t x ty the inequality d t x ty e d x y holds and t is a banach contraction one can find more examples in 8 a partial metric space was introduced by matthews 6 which is a generalization of metric space and admits non zero self distance definition 1 4 6 let x be a non empty set a partial metric space is a pair x p where p is a function p x x r called the partial metric such that for all x y z x the following axioms hold p 1 x y p x y p x x p y y p 2 p x x p x y p 3 p x y p y x and p 4 p x y p x z p z y p z z clearly by p 1 p 3 if p x y 0 then x y but the converse is in general not true one among the classical examples of partial metric spaces is a pair 0 p where p x y max x y for all x y 0 one can find more examples in 3 6 each partial metric p on x generates a t 0 topology p on x whose basis is the collection of all open p balls bp x x x 0 where bp x y x p x y p x x for all x x and is a positive real number 2 preliminaries the following are some basic concepts and preliminaries useful for the establishment of our results bukatin et al 3 provided the following definition which is useful in our discussion definition 2 1 6 let x p be a partial metric space then i a sequence xn in x p is said to be convergent to x x if and only if p x x limn p x xn ii a sequence xn in x p is a cauchy sequence if and only if limn m p xn xm exists and is finite iii a partial metric space x p is said to be complete if every cauchy sequence xn in x converges with respect to the topology p to a point x x such that p x x limn m p xn xm bukatin et al 3 proved the following lemma which is useful in our discussion lemma 2 2 3 let x p be a partial metric space then the mapping ps x x 0 given by ps x y 2 p x y p x x p y y for all x y x defines a metric on x fixed points for f contraction mappings in partial metric spaces 3 bukatin et al 3 also proved the following lemma lemma 2 3 3 let x p be a partial metric space then i a sequence xn is a cauchy sequence in x p if and only if it is a cauchy sequence in the metric space x ps ii a partial metric space x p is complete if and only if the metric space x ps is complete some researchers have attempted to generalize improve and extend the notion of f contraction map pings to partial metric spaces for instance nazam et al 7 introduced an improved f contraction of rational type in partial metric spaces and used it to prove a common fixed point theorem for a pair of self mappings the following theorem was given by nazam et al 7 theorem 2 4 7 the contractions h t x x on a complete partial metric space x such that either h or t is continuous and h t is a pair of improved f contraction of rational type have a common fixed point z of h t in x such that p z z 0 wardowski 8 proved the following results using f contraction mapping theorem 2 5 8 let m d be a complete metric space and let t m m be an f contraction on m then t has a unique fixed point x 0 m and for every x m the sequence t nx n n converges to x 0 in this article we generalize theorem 2 5 to partial metric spaces to obtain some fixed point theorems for the following is the extension of the definition 1 1 to partial metric spaces 3 main results definition 3 1 let x p be a partial metric space the mapping t x x is said to be an f contraction on x if there exists 0 and f f such that for all x y x p t x ty 0 f p t x ty f p x y 3 1 the following theorem is the extension of theorem 2 5 to partial metric spaces theorem 3 2 let x p be a complete partial metric space and let t x x be an f contraction map on x then t has a unique fixed point v x such that p v v 0 proof let x 0 x be any arbitrary point and fixed we define a sequence xn n n x such that xn 1 t xn for all n 0 1 2 also we denote an p xn 1 xn for all n 0 1 2 if there exists n 0 n such that xn 0 1 xn 0 then t xn 0 xn 0 this will end the proof now suppose an 0 for all n n with xn 1 6 xn then by the contractive condition 3 1 of definition 3 1 we have f an f an 1 f an 2 2 f an 3 3 f a 0 n 3 2 from 3 2 we obtain lim n f an since f f then by f 2 of definition 1 1 we get lim n an 0 3 3 4 luambano et al by f 3 of definition 1 1 there exists k 0 1 such that lim n an kf an 0 3 4 following 3 2 for all n n we have an k f an f a 0 ankn 0 3 5 taking into account 3 3 and 3 4 and letting n in 3 5 we obtain lim n nan k 0 3 6 since 3 6 holds then there exists n 1 n such that nank 1 for all n n 1 this implies that an 1 n 1 k for all n n 1 3 7 next we show that xn n n is a cauchy sequence consider n m n such that m n n 1 then by 3 7 and axiom p 3 of definition 1 4 we have p xn xm p xn xn 1 p xn 1 xn 2 p xm 1 xm m 1 j n 1 p x j x j p xn xn 1 p xn 1 xn 2 p xm 1 xm an an 1 am 1 m 1 i n ai i n ai i n 1 i 1 k the convergence of the series i n 1 i 1 k implies that lim n p xn xm 0 by lemma 2 2 we obtain that for any n m n ps xn xm 2 p xn xm 0 as n this implies that xn n n is a cauchy sequence with respect to ps and hence converges by lemma 2 3 thus there exists v x such that p v v lim n p xn v lim n m p xn xm 3 8 since lim n m p xn xm 0 then from 2 8 we deduce that p v v 0 lim n p xn v 3 9 by 3 9 it follows that xn 1 v as n with respect to p by the continuity of t it implies that v lim n xn lim n xn 1 lim n t xn t v from the contractive condition 3 1 we can write f p v t v f p v v this implies that p v t v 0 and by axioms p 1 and p 2 of definition 1 4 we conclude that v t v hence v is a fixed point of t we now prove that a fixed point is unique fixed points for f contraction mappings in partial metric spaces 5 suppose there exists u x such that u 6 v and u tu from the contractive condition 3 1 we can have p tu t v p u v 0 f p u v f p u v f p tu t v f p u v this implies that f p u v f p u v which is a contradiction hence u v thus the fixed point of t is unique corollary 3 3 let x p be a complete partial metric space and a contraction t x x satisfies all conditions in theorem 3 2 if we take f as defined in example 1 3 then t is a banach contraction as generalized by matthews 6 we now present a fixed point theorem for a pair of maps satisfying f contraction condition as an extension of theorem 3 2 theorem 3 4 let x p be a complete partial metric space and h t x x be a pair of f contraction mappings such that for all x y x we have p hx ty 0 f p hx ty f m x y 3 10 where m max p x y p x hx p y ty p x ty p y hx 2 then there exists a unique fixed point which is common for both h and t proof we first show the existence of a fixed point for both h and t let x 0 x be any arbitrary point and fixed we define a sequence xn x for all n n such that xn 1 hxn and xn 2 t xn 1 for n 0 1 2 now suppose that p xn 1 xn 2 0 for all n n 0 with xn 1 6 xn 2 then by the contractive condition 3 10 we have f p xn 1 xn 2 f p hxn t xn 1 f m xn xn 1 where m xn xn 1 max p xn xn 1 p xn hxn p xn 1 t xn 1 p xn t xn 1 p xn 1 hxn 2 max p xn xn 1 p xn xn 1 p xn 1 xn 2 p xn xn 2 p xn 1 xn 1 2 max p xn xn 1 p xn 1 xn 2 p xn xn 1 p xn 1 xn 2 2 max p xn xn 1 p xn 1 xn 2 6 luambano et al suppose max p xn xn 1 p xn 1 xn 2 p xn 1 xn 2 then f p xn 1 xn 2 f p xn 1 xn 2 f p xn 1 xn 2 f p xn 1 xn 2 which is a contra diction thus max p xn xn 1 p xn 1 xn 2 p xn xn 1 hence we can write f p xn 1 xn 2 f p xn xn 1 for all n n 0 3 11 hence from 3 11 we have f p xn xn 1 f p xn 1 xn 2 2 3 12 repeating these steps n times we get f p xn xn 1 f p x 0 x 1 n 3 13 then from 3 13 we obtain lim n f p xn xn 1 3 14 by f 1 of definition 1 1 we obtain lim n p xn xn 1 0 3 15 by f 3 there exists k 0 1 such that lim n p xn xn 1 kf p xn xn 1 0 3 16 following 3 13 for all n n we have p xn xn 1 k f p xn xn 1 f p x 0 x 1 p xn xn 1 kn 0 3 17 considering 3 14 3 15 and letting n in 3 16 we get lim n n p xn xn 1 k 0 3 18 since 3 18 holds there exists n 1 n such that n p xn xn 1 k 1 for all n n 1 3 19 next we show that xn n n is a cauchy sequence consider n m n such that m n n 1 then by 3 19 and axiom p 3 of definition 1 4 we have p xn xm p xn xn 1 p xn 1 xn 2 p xm 1 xm m 1 j n 1 p x j x j p xn xn 1 p xn 1 xn 2 p xm 1 xm an an 1 am 1 m 1 i n ai i n ai i n 1 i 1 k fixed points for f contraction mappings in partial metric spaces 7 the convergence of the series i n 1 i 1 k implies that lim n p xn xm 0 by lemma 2 2 we get that for any n m n ps xn xm 2 p xn xm 0 as n this implies that xn n n is a cauchy sequence with respect to ps since x p is complete then so is x ps then there exists u x such that lim n ps xn u 0 3 20 moreover by lemma 2 3 p u u lim n p xn u lim n m p xn xm 3 21 then from 3 21 we deduce that p u u 0 lim n p xn u 3 22 it follows that xn 1 u and xn 2 u as n with respect to p hence by the continuity of t it implies that u lim n xn lim n xn 1 lim n xn 2 lim n t xn 1 t lim n xn 1 tu hence from 3 10 we have f p u hu f p hu tu f m u u f p u u this yields that p u hu 0 and by p 1 p 2 of definition 1 4 we obtain that u hu thus hu tu u hence h t has a common fixed point u x next we will show that u is unique common fixed point of h and t suppose that by contradiction there exists z x such that u 6 z and z t z from the contractive condition 3 10 we have f p hu t z f m u z 3 23 where m u z max p u z p u hu p z t z p u t z p z hu 2 max p u z p u u p z z p u z p z u 2 max p u z p u z p z u 2 p u z from 3 23 we have f p hu t z f p u z 3 24 from 3 24 we obtain that p u z p u z which is a contradiction hence u z and u is a unique common fixed point of h t now we provide an illustrative example for theorem 3 2 8 luambano et al example 3 5 let x 0 1 and define p x y max x y for all x y x then x p is a complete partial metric space define the mapping t x x such that for all x x t x x 3 if x 0 1 0 if x 1 clearly t is a self mapping define the function f r r by f r ln r for all r r let x y x such that p t x ty 0 this implies that f p t x ty ln max x 3 y 3 now suppose that y x without loss of generality and taking ln 3 we obtain that ln max x 3 y 3 ln 3 ln y 3 ln p x y f p x y similarly if x y we obtain that f p t x ty f p x y thus the contractive condition 3 1 is satisfied for all x y x hence all hypotheses of the theorem 3 2 are satisfied and note that t has a unique fixed point x 0 remark 3 6 we also notice that t in example 3 5 is not an f contraction in x d and consequently theorem 2 5 cannot be applied acknowledgements
