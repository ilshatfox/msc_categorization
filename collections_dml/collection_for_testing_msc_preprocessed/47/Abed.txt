november 24 2016 abstract we propose the conditions for a continuous function to be projection convex i e f p 1 q f p 1 f q for any projections p and q and any real 0 1 also we obtain the

new criteria for the commutation of pro jections in terms of operator equalities involving functional calculus we obtain a trace characterization for the class of all positive normal functionals on a von neumann algebra other trace characterizations may be found in 3 8 and 11 2 preliminaries let h be a hilbert space over the field c and i be the identity operator on h let b h be the algebra of all linear bounded operators on h the commutant of a set x b h is the set x y b h xy yx for all x x a subalgebra m of the algebra b h is called a von neumann algebra acting in the hilbert space h if m m if x b h then x is a von neumann algebra and x is the least von neumann algebra containing x for a von neumann algebra m of operators on h let mpr m z m be the lattice of projections the cone of positive operators and the center of the algebra m respectively for p mpr put p i p and let mp px ph x m be a reduced von neumann algebra let m denote the set of all continuous linear functionals on m a linear functional on m is positive if x 0 for any x m a positive functional on m is tracial if xx x x for any x m the set k f c 0 1 f x f 1 x f 0 1 x for all x 0 1 is a subcone in c 0 1 the set of

holds for any 0 1 proof for projections p q we consider the von neumann algebra p q it is abelian therefore p q l for some measure space and there exist a b such that p ia q ib clearly f ia 1 ib f 1

and only if either 1 or 0 or ia b ib a 0 the latter means that p q lemma 4 for 0 1 and each pair p q m 2 c pr and any function f k the inequality f p 1 q f p 1 f q holds for all 0 1 proof it suffices to consider p diag 1 0 and q t t 1 t t 1 t 1 t 1 where t 0 1 and c with 1 see 1 there exists r m 2 c pr such that p 1 q 1 r 2 r 1 2 0 1 1 2 1 therefore f p 1 q f 1 r f 2 r on the other hand f p 1 f q

f pz 1 f qz 1 f qz f pz 1 f qz f pz 1 f qz thus f p 1 q z f pz 1 f qz and f p 1 q z f pz 1 f qz the algebra nz is abelian hence pz qz by remark 1 since nz m 2 c we have pz qz by remark 2 finally we note that p pz pz qz qz q we may directly prove the inequality for some functions example 1 let f x x 3 for x r then f p 1 q 3 p 2 1 pqp 1 2 qpq 1 pq qp 1 3 q since p q 2 0 we have pq qp p q also pqp

example 2 the function f x ex lies in k 1 therefore e p 1 q ep 1 eq for any 0 1 and the equality holds only if p q 4 the commutativity of projections lemma 5 let f c 0 1 0 1 and p q m 2 c pr then the equality f p 1 q f p 1 f q yields p q i if and only if f f 0 f 1 f 1 1 f 1 f 0 and either f f 1 1 f 0 or f 1 1 f 1 f 0 for any 0 1 1 lobachevskii journal of mathematics 4 sami abdullah abed proof consider p diag 1 0 t 0 1 and c with 1 and let q be as in 1 let p 1 q 1 r 2 r then f p 1 q f p 1 f q implies that f 1 r f 2 r f 1 p f 0 p 1 f 1 q f 0 q we have f k f 0 f 1 f 0 k for k 1 2 therefore f 1 f 0 1 f 2 f 0 2 f 1 f 0 if these equalities hold and for any 0 1 1 either f f 1 1 f 0 or f 1 1 f 1 f 0 then 1 2 1 since 1 2 1 see remark 2 on the other hand if 0 1 1 is such that f f 1 1 f 0 and f 1 1 f 1 f 0 then the equality f p 1 q f p 1 f q also holds for p and q such that p 1 q r 1 r the equality 1 2 1 1 4 1 1 t holds for t 1 1 1 hence the equality f p 1 q f p 1 f q does not imply that q i p lemma 6 for each pair p q b h pr such that pq qp 0 1 and any function f c 0 1 such that f f 0 f 1 f 0 1 f 1 f 0 the equality f p 1 q f p 1 f q holds proof for p q we consider the von neumann algebra p q it is abelian so p q l for some measure space and there exist a b such that p ia q ib we have f p 1 q f ia 1 ib f 1 ia b f 0 iac bc f ia b f 1 ib a f 1 ia b f 0 iac bc f 1 1 f 0 ia b 1 f 1 f 0 ib a f 0 f 1 f 0 ia 1 ib 1 f 0 f 1 f 0 ia 1 ib f 1 ia f 0 iac 1 f 1 ib f 0 ibc f ia 1 f ib f p 1 f q theorem 2 let p q b h pr 0 1 and f c 0 1 be such that f f 0 f 1 f 0 1 f 1 f 0 and either f f 1 1 f 0 or f 1 f 1 1 f 0 for 0 1 1 then f p 1 q f p 1 f q if and only if pq qp proof consider the von neumann algebra n p q by lemma 1 there exists a projection z z n such that nz is abelian by lemma 6 we have f pz 1 qz f pz 1 f qz since nz m 2 c by lemma 5 the equality f pz 1 qz f pz 1 f qz yields pzqz qzpz finally note that n nz nz and f p f pz pz f pz f pz for some functions we may prove the implication f p 1 q f p 1 f q pq qp without theorem 2 lobachevskii journal of mathematics an inequality for a projections 5 example 3 let f x x x 1 3 x 2 3 x 1 the equality f 1 3 p 2 3 q 1 3 f p 2 3 f q implies that pq qp note that f p f q 0 then the equality f 1 3 p 2 3 q 0 holds hence p 2 q p 2 q i p 2 q 2 i p 2 q 3 i 0 thus pq qp 2 0 and pq qp example 4 let f x x x 1 2 x 1 the equality f 1 2 p 1 2 q 1 2 f p 1 2 f q implies that pq qp since f p f q 0 we have f 1 2 p 1 2 q 0 but by straightforward calculations f 1 2 p 1 2 q 1 8 pqp qp pq qpq then pq pqpq and qp qpqp hence pq qp 2 0 and qp pq example 5 let f x x x 1 3 x 1 2 x 1 the equality f 1 2 p 1 2 q 1 2 f p 1 2 f q yields pq qp since f p f q 0 we have f 1 2 p 1 2 q 0 by straightforward calculations f 1 2 p 1 2 q 1 16 qp pq 2 1 3 pqp qpq pq qp therefore 3 q qp pq 2 q qpqpq qpq 0 note that pq qp 2 0 and q pq qp 2 q 0 also qpqpq qpq 0 thus qpqpq qpq analogously pqpqp pqp since ipq iqp 3 i qpqp qpqpqp pqpqpq pqpq 0 we have pq qp theorem 2 leads us to more complicated examples example 6 the function f x sin 3 x meets the conditions of theorem 2 the equality f 1 3 p 2 3 q 1 3 f p 2 3 f q implies that pq qp example 7 the function f x x sin x x 0 0 x 0 or f x sin 2 x meets the conditions of theorem 2 the equality f 1 2 p 1 2 q 1 2 f p 1 2 f q yields pq qp 5 characterization of tracial functionals lemma 7 let p q m 2 c pr f c 0 1 be such a nonlinear function that f 1 x f x f 1 f 0 for all x 0 1 and f x f 0 f 1 f 0 x for any x 0 1 1 2 also let be a positive functional on m 2 c then the following conditions are equivalent i 0 1 p q

f p 1 q f 1 r f 2 r and f p 1 f q f 1 p f 0 1 p 1 f 1 q 1 f 0 1 q f 0 r r f 1 f 0 p 1 q f 0 r r f 1 f 0 1 r 2 r lobachevskii journal of mathematics 6 sami abdullah abed f 0 f 1 f 0 1 r f 0 f 1 f 0 2 r iii i if f is linear the equality is evident if is tracial then r r and f 0 f 1 f 0 1 r f 0 f 1 f 0 2 r f 1 f 0 r f 1 f 2 r f 1 r f 2 r ii iii if f p 1 q f p 1 f q then the equality f 1 x f x f 1 f 0 implies that f 1 x f 1 f 0 1 x f x f 1 f 0 x 0 therefore f 1 f 0 f 1 f 0 1 r f 2 f 0 f 1 f 0 2 r 0 and r r for any one dimensional r m 2 c pr this is equivalent to being tracial theorem 3 let m be a von neumann algebra be a positive functional on m and f c 0 1 be such that f x f 1 x f 0 f 1 for all x 0 1 and f x f 0 f 1 f 0 x for all x 0 1 1 2 then the following conditions are equivalent i 0 1 p
