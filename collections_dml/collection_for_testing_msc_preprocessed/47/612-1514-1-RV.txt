operator 1 introduction multiplication operators are associated closely with various significant classes of operators such as hankel operators toeplitz operators and composition operators see 1 7 and references therein in fact the unilateral shift on the hardy space h 2 one of the most interesting operators is unitarily equivalent to the multiplication operatormz onh 2 because of their wide appearance and their tendency to bring in new classes of operators multiplication operators have been studied extensively over the years and their study has been lifted to various function spaces such as bergman spaces dirichlet spaces lorentz spaces and orlicz spaces to name a few see 3 6 10 and the references therein the weighted hardy spaces were introduced by kelley 9 and have the ability to yield the classical hardy bergman dirichlet and fischer spaces for specific choices of the weight sequences see 16 thus the study over these spaces is quite fruitful and hence the multiplication operators and their generalizations have been discussed on these spaces see 15 16 in recent times the generalized multiplication operators on weighted hardy spaces have been introduced in 13 and further extended to kth order generalized multiplication operators in 4 where k 1 is an integer however the operators under consideration in the aforementioned studies 4 13 are the bounded ones in fact assumptions are taken on the weight sequence and the inducing symbols so that the induced generalized multiplication operators are bounded and the discussion is carried forward we find that it is not a difficult task to ensure the existence of unbounded generalized multiplication operators our focus in this paper is to undertake the study of these unbounded operators before we proceed ahead we would like to add here that the discussion of unbounded linear operators over hilbert spaces is of prime interest in physics also unbounded operators arise in varied applications notably in quantum mechanics and in connection with differential equations the theory of unbounded operators was stimulated in 1920 s and the systematic development of theory is credited to j von neumann and m h stone see 11 and the references therein the two most important unbounded linear operators are the multiplication operator and the differentiation operator e mail gopal d sati gmail com e mail ramitmukta 61 gmail com e mail ohri neel gmail com 2 gopal datt at al we now provide the outline of the paper in section 2 we provide a brief orientation about unbounded operators alongwith the setting of terminology to be used subsequently in the paper in section 3 we discuss the closedness and densely defined nature of some unbounded operators we also describe some basic properties of the adjoints of these operators 2 notations and preliminaries let n be a sequence of positive real numbers with 0 1 for 1 p lethp be the space of formal power series f z n 0 fnz n n 0 fn p p n thenhp is a banach space under the norm f p n 0 fn p pn for p 2 the space h 2 is a hilbert space called weighted hardy space with norm induced by the inner product defined as f g n 0 fngn 2 n where f z n 0 fnz n and g z n 0 gnz n are elements of h 2 hence f is given as f 2 n 0 fn 2 2 n the set en n 0 where en z zn n forms an orthonormal basis for the space h 2 the symbol h denotes the set of formal power series such that h 2 h 2 we refer to 16 as well as the references therein for the details and applications of these spaces we recall from 4 that for a natural number k and an element f of h 2 with expression f z n 0 fnz n f k is defined as f k z n k nfnz n k where n n n k n k and is called the kth derivative of f for a fixed natural number k 1 if is a formal power series then the mapping f 7 f k for each f d h 2 where d denotes the domain of this mapping is denoted by m k in general this mapping need not be bounded however under suitable assumptions on the sequence we can see that this mapping becomes bounded continuous on h 2 and in this case we call these operators as kth order generalized multiplication operators on h 2 we refer to 4 for the bounded case of m k it is worth recalling here that the differentiation operator x 7 x the derivative of x is an unbounded linear operator 11 example 4 13 4 the similarity of this operator with the mapping f 7 f k intuitively leads us to discuss the unbounded behaviour of this mapping in the present paper we describe the structure and behaviour of the unbounded operatormzp k where p is a fixed natural number in this pursuit we begin with describing the properties of the operator f 7 f k denoted by dk which is same as the operator m 1 k throughout the paper the symbol n denotes the set of all natural numbers and k refers to a fixed natural number by an operator on a hilbert space h we mean a linear mapping t d t h h defined on a linear subspace d t known as domain of t of h we use the symbols ker t and ran t to denote respectively the kernel of t and its range space we reserve the symbol gt to denote the graph of an operator t by definition gt x tx x d t for a closable operator t the smallest closed extension of t is denoted by t and called the closure of t the closure of a subset s of h is denoted by s and the orthogonal complement by s we refer to 5 11 14 for the definitions and details of these notions lobachevskii journal of mathematics unbounded generalized multiplication operators 3 3 unbounded generalized multiplication operators for a natural number k consider the linear operator dk d dk h 2 h 2 given by f 7 f k for each f d dk f z n 0 fnz n h 2 f k z n k nfnz n k h 2 we claim that for the sequence satisfying n k n k for each n k or limn n k n k for some k 0 the mapping dk is unbounded for let fn z z n n where n n then fn 1 and dkfn z nz n k n so that dkfn n n k n k n for n k which ensures that dk is unbounded in the same vein we obtain that the restriction limn n p k n k for some k 0 leads to unbounded generalized multiplication operator mzp k where p n thus the existence of unbounded operators dk and mzp k is ensured on specific sequence spaces h 2 henceforth in the paper whenever we discuss the operators dk and mzp k on h 2 the weight sequence is assumed to be such that these operators are unbounded to ensure the existence of the adjoint t of an unbounded linear operator t it must be densely defined i e d t must be dense in h see 11 we know that the closed subspace generated by en n 0 is dense in h 2 we find that for each n 0 en z zn n d dk because en z h 2 and e k n z 0 if n k n n zn k if n k so that e k n z h 2 for each n 0 as a consequence the operator dk is densely defined theorem 1 dk is a densely defined unbounded operator theorem 3 1 ensures the existence of the adjoint of dk so we now proceed to compute d k consider the collection of all elements g h 2 for which there exists a h h 2 such that dkf g f h for each f d dk it is known from the theory of unbounded operators 5 11 that for each g in this collection we obtain a unique h h 2 satisfying dkf g f h the collection of all such g is represented as d d k the domain of d k and in this situation we define d kg h for each g d d k we obtain the following theorem 2 the adjoint of dk is the operator d k d d k h 2 h 2 given by d k g z n 0 nz n for each g z n 0 gnz n d d k where n s are given as n 0 if n k ngn k 2 n k 2 n if n k proof the proof follows using straightforward computations as follows let f z n 0 fnz n d dk and g z n 0 gnz n d d k then dkf g f h provides that for each f d dk f h n 0 n kfn kz n n 0 gnz n n 0 n kfn kgn n 2 n 0 fn k n kgn n 2 n 0 fnz n n 0 nz n f n 0 nz n where n ngn k 2 n k 2 n if n k and zero otherwise since f d dk is arbitrary and d dk h 2 we obtain the desired result lobachevskii journal of mathematics 4 gopal datt at al consider the space h 2 h 2 with the inner product defined as f 1 g 1 f 2 g 2 f 1 f 2 g 1 g 2 for each f 1 g 1 f 2 g 2 h 2 h 2 then h 2 h 2 is a hilbert space and u h 2 h 2 h 2 h 2 defined as u f g g f for each f g h 2 h 2 is a unitary operator now utilizing 11 problem 7 pg 541 and the fact that u is a unitary operator we can relate the graphs of dk and d k theorem 3 we have the following for the operator dk 1 gd k u g dk u gdk 2 dk is closable i e dk permits closure proof we prove only 2 let fn hn be two sequences in d dk such that limn fn limn hn f for some f z m 0 fmz m h 2 where fn z m 0 fn mz m and hn z m 0 hn mz m let 0 be an arbitrary real number since fn f 0 there exists n 0 0 such that fn l fl 2 l 2 m 0 fn m fm 2 m 2 fn f 2 l 2 n no where l 0 is fixed utilizing the fact that hn f 0 we obtain that for each l 0 lim n fn l fl lim n hn l 1 further assuming that limn dkfn g and limn dkhn h where g h h 2 are given as g z m 0 gmz m and h z m 0 hmz m and using the structure of dk we obtain that for each l 0 gl l k lim n fn l k and hl l k lim n hn l k this together with equation 1 yields that gl l kfl k hl for each l 0 thus g h and the proof is complete for we have obtained that dk is closable we now compute the closure dk of dk in this pursuance consider a sequence fn inm such that fn f anddkfn g for some f g h 2 working along parallel lines as in theorem 3 we obtain that for each l 0 fl lim n fn l and gl l k lim n fn l k where fn z m 0 fn mz m f z m 0 fmz m and g z m 0 gmz m respectively are the formal power series expansions of fn f and g thus gl k lfl for each l k and consequently f k z m 0 m kfm kz m m 0 gmz m g z h 2 this helps to provide the following theorem 4 the operator dk is a closed linear transformation by the definition of the adjoint of a densely defined operator we obtain that d k is a linear and closed operator thus the closure of d k is the operator d k itself also the adjoint of a densely defined operator is densely defined so d k is a densely defined operator using the densely defined nature and closedness of operators we obtain the following theorem 5 for the densely defined and closed operators dk and d k we have 1 ker dk and ker d k are closed linear subspaces of h 2 2 ran dk is closed if and only ifran d k is closed lobachevskii journal of mathematics unbounded generalized multiplication operators 5 next we attempt to discuss the sums and products of the operator dk with some known operators defined on h 2 it is trivial to obtain that the operator dk i is a closed operator with domain d dk for each complex number where i denotes the identity operator on h 2 if we consider the bounded operator t on h 2 called weighted toeplitz operator see 12 induced by the symbol we observe that t dk d k t and t dk t d k it is worth pointing out here that an additional condition that r n n 1 1 for n 0 and r n n 1 1 for n 0 for some r 0 is imposed on the weight sequence so as to ensure the existence of some non trivial symbols l inducing bounded weighted toeplitz operators on h 2 it is imperative that we ensure the existence of bounded t and unbounded dk on the same sequence space h 2 for the above discussion to be meaningful we find that the co existence is ensured consider h 2 with given by n 2 n as an example next we investigate the self adjointness of the operator dk consider the following example example 1 let f z 1 and g z zk then f and g both belong to h 2 such that f k 0 and g k k also are in h 2 thus f g d dk and using the structure of dk it is easy to observe that dkf g 0 while f dkg k this provides thatdk cannot be self adjoint since k 1 is fixed however we find thatd kdk is a self adjoint operator with domain d d kdk given by f d dk dkf d d k further d d kdk can be expressed as f h 2 n 0 2 n k fn k 2 2 n and n 0 4 n k fn k 2 4 n 2 n k if the sequence is such that 2 n k 2 n 2 n k m for some m 0 for instance the sequence given by n n then d d kdk f h 2 n 0 2 n k fn k 2 2 n using the theory of unbounded operators we can prove the following theorem 6 the operators i d kdk 1 anddk i d kdk 1 onh 2 are bounded with norms atmost 1 in addition the operator i d kdk 1 is a self adjoint and positive operator next we discuss normality and quasinormality conditions for the operator dk we recollect that a densely defined operator t d t h h is normal if either of the following equivalent conditions hold 1 t is closed and t t tt 2 d t d t and tx t x for each x d t d t for a fixed integer m 0 we compute the values dkd k em and d kdk em the structure of dk provides that d kdk em 2 m 2 m k 2 m em if m k 0 otherwise and dkd k em 2 m k 2 m 2 m k em for each m 0 we put to use condition 2 stated above to assert that the operator dk can not be normal for if d dk d d k we obtain that for each 0 m k dkem 0 6 d kem in fact dk fails to become quasinormal see 8 theorem 3 6 for we compute and find that for each m 0 d k 2 d 2 k em 2 m 2 m k 2 m 2 k 2 m em if m 2 k 0 otherwise lobachevskii journal of mathematics 6 gopal datt at al and d kdk 2 em 4 m 4 m k 4 m em if m k 0 otherwise let p n we shall now focus our attention towards the unbounded generalized multiplication operator mzp k d mzp k h 2 h 2 induced by the symbol zp and given as mzp k f zp f k for each f d mzp k f m 0 fmz m h 2 zp f k m p m k pfm k p z m h 2 adopting similar approach as in theorem 1 and utilizing that zp e k n z 0 if n k n n zn k p if n k we obtain the following theorem 7 the unbounded operator mzp k is densely defined in our pursuance to discuss the closedness of the operator mzp k we adopt similar methods and techniques as adopted for dk and achieve the following theorem 8 mzp k is a closed linear transformation proof let fn be a sequence in d mzp k such thatfn f andmzp kfn g for some f g h 2 we obtain that for each l 0 fl limn fn l and gl l k pfl k p if l p 0 otherwise where fn z m 0 fn mz m f z m 0 fmz m and g z m 0 gmz m respectively this pro vides that zpf k m p m k pfm k pz m g z hence f d mzp k and mzp kf g and the operator mzp k is a closed linear transformation it is easy to compute the adjoint m zp k of mzp k theorem 9 the adjoint m zp k of mzp k is the operator m zp k d m zp k h 2 h 2 given by m zp k g z n k ngn p k 2 n p k 2 n zn for each g z n 0 gnz n d m zp k it is known that a linear transformation b is an extension of a linear transformation a written in symbols asa b if d a d b andaf bf for each f d a d b see 14 sincedk and mzp k are both densely defined unbounded operators we obtain that d km zp k mzp kdk it is interesting to observe that for p 6 k the operator mzp k is not self adjoint for if we consider f z zp and g z zk then f g d mzp k and mzp kf g 0 while f mzp kg k p 2 however for p k mzp k turns out to be a self adjoint operator theorem 10 the unbounded operator mzk k is self adjoint lobachevskii journal of mathematics unbounded generalized multiplication operators 7 proof let f g d mzk k such that f z m 0 fmz m and g z m 0 gmz m then it is a matter of routine computations to see that mzk kf g m k mfmz m m 0 gmz m m k mfmgm m 2 m k fm mgm m 2 f mzk kg next we observe that the operators mzk k ii are onto for let h z m 0 hmz m h 2 define f z m 0 fmz m where fm hm m i for each m 0 where m 0 if m k m m k if m k then m 0 fm 2 m 2 m 0 hm 2 2 m 1 m 2 m 0 hm 2 m 2 and m k mfm 2 m 2 m k 2 m 2 m 1 hm 2 m 2 m 0 hm 2 m 2 thus f d mzk k and mzk k ii f z m 0 hmz m h z thus the range of both the opera tors mzk k ii and mzk k ii is the space h 2 itself these observations together with the fact that mzp k is densely defined provide the desired result theorem 10 helps to provide that ker m zk k ii and ker m zk k ii are both equal to the singleton set 0 in our attempt to discuss the normality of the operator mzp k we observe that for each m 0 m zp kmzp k em 2 m 2 m k p 2 m em if m k 0 otherwise and mzp km zp k em 2 m k p 2 m 2 m k p em if m p 0 otherwise this helps to conclude that 1 for p k we obtain that for each m 0 m zk k mzk k em mzk km zk k em 2 mem if m k 0 otherwise by linearity ofmzk k and that of its adjoint we find that m zk k mzk k f mzk km zk k f for each f d m zk k mzk k d mzk km zk k provided the domains are equal thus the operator mzk k is a normal operator if d m zk k mzk k d mzk km zk k 2 for natural numbers p 6 k the operator mzp k can not be normal lobachevskii journal of mathematics 8 gopal datt at al 3 for p 6 k we compute and obtain that for each m 0 m zp k 2 m 2 zp k em 2 m 2 m k p 2 m 2 k 2 p 2 m em if m 2 k p 0 otherwise and m zp kmzp k 2 em 4 m 4 m k p 4 m em if m k 0 otherwise this provides that the operator mzp k for p 6 k can not be quasinormal references 1 avendan o r a m and rosenthal p an
