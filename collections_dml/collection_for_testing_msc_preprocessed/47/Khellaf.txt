the propriety l is hold with norm convergence in addition we prove that under collectively compact convergence the proprieties u and l are hold we describe the theoretical foundations of the method in details as well as illustrate its effectiveness by numerical results 2010 mathematical subject classification 47 a 10 47 a 75 47 a 58 65 f 15 keywords and phrases spectral pollution generalized spectrum proprieties u and l 1 introduction it is well known that the spectral pollution is the weakness of projection methods for an unbounded operator thus our technic is an alternative method based on disrupting an unbounded operator by a bounded one until that the spectral properties transform on controlled case the generalized spectrum takes its place as the desired case we will show that every unbounded operator contains a decomposition of two bounded operators which carry all the spectral properties through this decomposition and basing upon its numerical approximations the phenomenon of spectral pollution will be resolved this phenomenon is considered as a serious problem in several areas in the field of applied mathematics that has been studied in detail in 1 3 the concept of generalized spectrum was constructed under the generalized spectrum of the matrices see 4 then extended for bounded operators see 5 6 the natural framework of our research is a complex separable banach space x we will define an unbounded operator a with non empty resolvent set in the first section we will prove that each spectral problem contains a generalized spectral problem equivalent in this respect we will show our results for generalized spectrum throughout the second section we will work on sufficient condition for the generalized spectral convergence of a sequences of linear operators which is norme convergence finally we will prove the previous results under different condition that is collectively compact convergence while our numerical results are applied on harmonic oscillator operator which is defined over l 2 r by au u x 2 u accordingly the sufficient condition for the generalized spectral convergence of a sequences of linear operators is that the generalized spectrum is eventually contained in any neighborhood of the generalized spectrum of its approach and the corresponding generalized spectral subspace has the same dimension as its approach this former is identical with spectral subspace of the original problem the spectral convergence is adopted under the proprieties u and l although in numerical test we will use the upper and lower semi continuity of the spectrum where the proprieties u and l are consequences of its respectively see 7 e mail amarlasix gmail com khellaf ammar univ guelma dz e mail guebaihamza yahoo fr guebbai

is sp t s c re t s for z re t s we define r z t s t zs 1 the generalized resolvent operator we define c as a generalized eigenvalue when t s is not injective then the set e ker t s is the generalized spectral subspace we say that has an finite algebraic multiplicity if there exists where dimker t s if the operator s is invertible we have sp t s sp s 1 t if s 1 does not exist the generalized spectrum it can be bounded or the whole c or empty the next three results are a generalization of the classical case s i see 6 theorem 1 let re t s and c where r t s s 1 then re t s corollary 1 the set sp t s is closed in c theorem 2 the function r t s re t s bl x is analytic and its derivative given by r t s s r t s we consider an unbounded operator a with domain d a x the following theorem shows that every unbounded operator contains a decomposition of two bounded operators which will express it in the theory of the generalized spectrum theorem 3 if re a then there exist t s bl x such that sp a sp t s in particulary is an eigenvalue for a if and only if is a generalized eigenvalue for the couple t s in addition we have ker a i ker t s proof let re a we put s a i 1 t a a i 1 we prove that re a a i 1 bl x a i a i 1 bl x t s bl x t s 1 bl x re t s let sp t s there exists u x 0 such that tu su thus tu su a a i 1 u a i 1 u u a i 1 u u d a we apply a i on tu su we find that au u finally we observe by construction that ker a i ker t s we note that the choice of taking the couple t s as a function of the resolvent operator of a is not only the case see the numerical application below theorem 4 let t and s be two operators in bl x and let be a generalized eigenvalue of finite type isolated in sp t s we designate by the cauchy contour that separating from sp t s then the operator p 1 2 i t zs 1 s dz define a projection proof we note that the bounded operator p does not depend on the choice of see theorem 2 we consider now another cauchy contour such that int then for any u x we have p 2 u 1 2 i 2 t zs 1 s dz t z s 1 sudz 1 2 i 2 t zs 1 s t z s 1 sudz dz lobachevskii journal of mathematics generalized spectrum approximation 3 1 2 i 2 t zs 1 t z s 1 z z sudz dz 1 2

generalized eigenvalue of finite type for the couple t s theorem 5 under the same hypothesis as in theorem 4 if m ker t s then px ker t s proof firstly we fix re t s where for any cauchy contour associated with for we have s t s t 1 i s t 1 s which gives s t 1 1 i s t 1 s 1 1 s t 1 thus we can see that 1 is an eigenvalue for the operator s t 1 s indeed u ker t s t s u 0 s t 1 s t t s u u s t 1 su 1 u u ker s t 1 s 1 i we reverse the last process we have ker t s ker s t 1 s 1 i now under the choice of we can see that for all cauchy contour is also a cauchy contour for the eigenvalue 1 where 1 we put b s t 1 s and z 1 for any we write s t 1 s z i z zi b 1 thus by passage to the integral over we have 1 2 i s t 1 s d 1 2 i z i z zi b 1 dz z 2 1 2 i z 1 i zi b 1 dz 1 2 i 1 z dz i 1 2 i zi b 1 dz p 1 while p 1 is the spectral projection associated with the operator b s t 1 s around 1 hence according to the spectral decomposition theory px p 1 x ker s t 1 s 1 i ker t s lobachevskii journal of mathematics 4 a khellaf h guebbai in the case where ker t s m for our generalization takes sense i e px ker t s we can assume then t is commuting with s to obtain ker t s ker s t 1 s 1 i we designate by b 0 k the bull with center 0 and radius k 0 proposition 2 1 let t and s be two operators in bl x then sp t s b 0 k 0 sp s proof suppose that sp t s b 0 k then for re t s we have s t s t s t 1 s 1 1 as re t s then sp t s 1 sp s t 1 s so the fact that sp t s b 0 k implies that 0 sp s t 1 s hence 0 sp s the set of all generalized eigenvalues is denoted by spp t s it s clear that when x is finite dimensional the generalized spectrum consists only of the generalized eigenvalues except proposition 2 2 let t and s be two operators in bl x if s is compact then sp t s spp t s proof we use the expression 1 since the operator s t 1 s is compact thus sp t s is a set of isolated points let sp t s then there is z sp s t 1 s where z 1 hence there exists u x such that s t 1 su zu s t 1 s s u

spectral pollution is closed as is known our study is around the eigenvalue of finite type let t and s be two bounded operators in bl x we assume that there exist two sequences of bounded operators tn n n and sn n n in bl x such that a 1 tn t 0 a 2 sn s 0 lemma 1 let p 1 and p 2 be two projections in bl x such that p 1 p 2 p 1 1 then dimp 1 x dimp 2 x proof see 7 theorem 6 let be a generalized eigenvalue of finite type isolated in sp t s under a 1 and a 2 there is a positive integer n 0 such that for n n 0 dimpx dimpnx where pn 1 2 i tn zsn 1 sn dz lobachevskii journal of mathematics generalized spectrum approximation 5 proof we put en t tn fn s sn let z be in then tn zsn i en zfn r z t s t zs it proves that under a 1 and a 2 tn zsn has a bounded inverse which is uniformly bounded for n n where tn zsn 1 r z t s k 0 en zfn krk z t s we put n int sp tn sn we define the bounded operator pn 1 2 i tn zsn 1 sn dz for n larger enough we mention that n and pn do not depend on see 4 hence pn p tends to 0 indeed it suffices that to see tn zsn 1 t zs 1 tn zsn 1 en zfn t zs 1 c en zfn and tn zsn 1 sn t zs 1 s tn zsn 1 fn tn zsn 1 t zs 1 s finally we call the lemma 1 to finish the result we remark that n for n large enough otherwise pn 0 which implies that p 0 corollary 2 let be a generalized eigenvalue of finite type isolated in sp t s under a 1 and a 2 there exists a sequence n sp tn sn such that n proof we fix 0 such that the sequence n int sp tn sn belongs to the bull b let n n n a subsequence converges to where so by according to propriety u proved in 6 we see that sp t s but b and sp t s b hence thus n 4 generalized spectral approximation under collectively compact convergence we assume that b 1 tn cc t b 2 sn cc s we state in this section a set of lemmas which will be needed in the proof of our main theorems lemma 2 if tn p t and sn cc s then for any bounded operator h in bl x tn t h sn s 0 proof since tn p t and the set h n n 0 sx snx x 1 has compact closure then tn t h sn s 0 lemma 3 let t t s and s belong to bl x and let z re t s such that t t z s s r z t s 2 1 then z re t s and t zs 1 r z t s 1 t t z s s r z t s 1 t t z s s r z t s 2 lobachevskii journal of mathematics 6 a khellaf h guebbai proof we put e t t r z t s and f s s r z t s we can see then t zs i e zf t zs so by using the second neumann expansion see 7 we obtain that t zs 1 r z t s k 0 e zf 2 k r z t s k 0 e zf 2 k 1 r z t s i e zf k 0 e zf 2 k t zs 1 r z t s 1 e zf 1 e zf 2 proposition 4 1 if b 1 and b 2 are obtained then for z re t s z re tn sn for n larger enough proof let z re t s and for n larger enough tn zsn i e n zf n t zs where e n t tn r z t s and f n s sn r z t s firstly we have e n zf n 2 e n 2 zf n 2 e nf n f ne n so according to the lemma 2 e n zf n 2 0 thus by applying the last lemma we obtain that z re tn sn the following theorem shows that property u is obtained under the collectively compact convergence theorem 7 under b 1 and b 2 if n sp tn sn and n then sp t s proof assume that sp t s then according to the corollary 1 there exists r 0 such that the ball b r is contained in re t s hence according to the proposition 4 1 b r is contained also in re tn sn for n larger enough in the other hand n thus there exists n 0 such that for n n 0 n b r re tn sn which forms the contradiction to show that the property l is obtained we need the following lemmas lemma 4 under b 1 and b 2 then z re t s re tn sn tn zsn 1 p t zs 1 proof for z re t s re tn sn to find the desired result we use tn zsn 1 t zs 1 tn zsn 1 e n zf n where e n t tn r z t s f n s sn r z t s lemma 5 under b 1 and b 2 and for z re t s re tn sn we have tn zsn 1 t zs 1 s 0 proof we put that e n t tn t zs 1 f n s sn t zs 1 since t zs 1 tn zsn 1 s tn zsn 1 t zs 1 e n zf n s t zs 1 e n zf n s then by applying the lemma 2 we find the result lobachevskii journal of mathematics generalized spectrum approximation 7 lemma 6 under b 1 and b 2 we have tn zsn 1 sn t zs 1 s 2 0 for all z re t s re tn sn proof for z re t s re tn sn where n is larger enough tn zsn 1 sn t zs 1 s tn zsn 1 t zs 1 sn s tn zsn 1 t zs 1 s t zs 1 sn s gn hn kn so according to the lemma 2 and the lemma 4 and the lemma 5 we find h 2 n k 2 n hnkn and knhn tend to zeros theorem 8 let be a generalized eigenvalue of finite type isolated in sp t s under b 1 and b 2 there exists a positive integer n 0 such that for n n 0 dimpx dimpnx where pn 1 2 i tn zsn 1 sn dz proof let z we apply the proposition 4 1 we find that tn zsn 1 bl x which is uniformly bounded for n n and z we define n int sp tn sn for n larger enough the bounded operator pn is well define by pn 1 2 i tn zsn 1 sn dz hence according to the theorem 2 there exists z 0 re t s and c 0 such that pn p 2 c tn z 0 sn 1 sn t z 0 s 1 s so by applying the lemma 6 we find that pn p 2 0 in the other hand for any u x see the lemma 4 tn zsn 1 snu t zs 1 su thus pn p p but dimpx so we obtain pn p p 0 finally we apply the lemma 3 we have dimpx dimpnx corollary 3 let be a generalized eigenvalue of finite type isolated in sp t s under b 1 and b 2 there exists a sequence n sp tn sn such that n we mention that the two conditions a 1 a 2 and b 1 b 2 do not have any connection between them in natural ways however under a 1 b 2 or a 2 b 1 the proprieties u and l are hold too theorem 9 under a 1 and b 2 or a 2 and b 1 the proprieties u and l are hold as before the difficult is how to reverse tn zsn 1 for z re t s and how to show pn p 2 0 thus the two next lemmas illustrate these points lemma 7 under a 1 and b 2 or a 2 and b 1 we have tn t z sn s r z t s 1 2 0 for z re t s re tn sn proof see the lemma 2 lemma 8 under a 1 and b 2 or a 2 and b 1 we have tn zsn 1 sn t zs 1 s 2 0 for z re t s re tn sn lobachevskii journal of mathematics 8 a khellaf
