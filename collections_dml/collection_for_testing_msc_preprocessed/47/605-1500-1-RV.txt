morocco abstract using a generalized spherical mean operator we obtain a generaliza tion of two theorems 84 and 85 of titchmarsh for the dunkl transform for functions satisfying the dunkl lipschitz condition in the space lp rd wk x dx where 1 p 2 keywords dunkl operator dunkl transform generalized spherical mean oper ator mathematics subject classification 47 b 48 1 intoduction and preliminaries dunkl 5 defined a family of first order differential difference operators related to some reflection groups the theory of dunkl operators provides generalization of various multivariable function among others we cite the exponential function the fourier transform and the translation for more details about this theory see 4 6 8 9 10 11 and the references therein e c titchmarsh 12 theorems 84 85 proved following two theorems theorem 1 1 if f x belongs to lipschitz class lip p in the lp norm on the real line r then its fourier transform f belongs to l r for p p p 1 q p p 1 where 0 1 1 p 2 and lip p f lp r f x h f x lp r o h as h 0 1 theorem 1 2 let 0 1 and assume that f l 2 r then the following are equivalents 1 f x h f x l 2 r o h as h 0 2 r f 2 d o r 2 as r in this paper we try to explore the validity of those theorems in case of the dunkl transform in the space lp rd wk x dx where 1 p 2 for this generalization we use a generalized spherical mean operator in the first we collect some notations and results on dunkl analysis see 5 10 we consider rd with the euclidean scalar product and x x x for rd 0 let be the reflection in the hyperplane h rd orthogonal to i e x x 2 x x 2 a finite set r rd 0 is called a root system if r r and r r for all r for a given root system r the reflection r generate a finite group w o d the reflection group associated with r we fix rd r h and define a positive root system r r 0 a function k r c be a multiplicity function on r for brevity we introduce the index k r k moreover let wk denote the weight function wk x r x 2 k where wk is w invariant and homogeneous of degree 2 we let be the normalized surface measure on the unit sphere sd 1 in rd and set d k y wk y d y then k is a w invariant measure on sd 1 we let dk k sd 1 introduced by c f dunkl in 5 the dunkl operators tj 1 j d on rd asso ciated with the reflection group w and the multiplicity function k are the first order differential difference operators given by 2 tjf x f xj x r k j f x f x x f c 1 rd where j ej e 1 ed being the canonical basis of rd and c 1 rd is the space of functions of class c 1 on rd the dunkl kernel ek on rd rd has been introduced by c f dunkl in 7 for y rd the function x 7 ek x y can be viewed as the analytic solution on rd of the following initial problem tju x y yju x y for 1 j d u 0 y 1 for all y rd this kernel has unique holomorphic extension to cd cd m ro sler has proved in 11 the following integral representation for the dunkl kernel ek x z rd e y z d x y x rd z cd where x is a probability measure on rd with support in the closed ball b 0 x of center 0 and raduis x proposition 1 3 10 let z w cd and c then 1 ek z 0 1 2 ek z w ek w z 3 ek z w ek z w 4 for all 1 d n x rd z cd we have d zek x z x exp x rez where d z z 11 z d d 1 d in particulier d zek ix z x for all x z rd 3 we denote lpk l p rd wk x dx with 1 p 2 the banach space of measurable functions on rd such that f p k rd f x pwk x dx 1 p the dunkl transform is defined for f lpk by the formula fk f c 1 k rd f x ek i x wk x dx where the constant ck is given by ck rd e z 2 2 wk z dz the inverse formula f x rd fk f ek ix wk d x rd the dunkl transform shares several properties with its counterpart in the classical case we mention here in particular that parseval theorem holds in l 2 k by plancherel s theorem and the marcinkiewicz s interpolation theorem 12 we get for f lpk with 1 p 2 and q such that 1 p 1 q 1 fk f q k c f p k 1 where c is a positive constant the dunkl laplacian k is defined by the formula k d i 1 t 2 i k trime che has introduced 13 the dunkl translation operators x x rd for f lpk and we have fk x f ek ix fk f in lpk consider the generalized spherical mean operator defined by mhf x 1 dk sd 1 x hy d k y x rd h 0 for 12 we introduce the normalized bessel functuion j defined by 4 j z 1 n 0 1 n z 2 2 n n n 1 z c where is the gamma function lemma 1 4 1 the following inequalities are fulfilled 1 j x 1 2 1 j x x lemma 1 5 the following inequality is true 1 j x c with x 1 where c 0 is a certain constant proof analog of lemma 2 9 in 2 from 3 we have 1 j r min 1 r 2 2 where the symbol means the left hand side is bounded above and below by a positive constant times the right hand side for f lpk we have fk mhf j d 2 1 h fk f the first and higher order finite differences of f x are defined as follows zhf x mh i f x

t 1 s 2 f s s 2 d 1 ds we write t t 1 s 2 f s s 2 d 1 q s 2 d 1 1 q ds then if q by ho lder inequality we obtain t t 1 s 2 qf q s s 2 d 1 ds q t 1 s 2 d 1 ds 1 q c 0 t 2 q q q 1 t 2 d 1 q o t 2 t 2 d

and it follows that f l 0 s 2 d 1 ds provided 2 d 2 d q 0 this ends the proof for the second result of this paper we need first to define the dunkl lipschitz class definition 2 2 let 0 m m n a function f wm 2 k is said to be in the dunkl lipschitz class denoted by lipk 2 if zmh r kf x 2 2 k o h as h 0 theorem 2 3 let f wm 2 k then the following are equivalents 1 f lipk 2 2 s 4 r fk f 2 wk d

as h 0 8 it follows that s 2 s 4 r fk f 2 wk d ks 2 as s where k 0 is some constant furthermore we have s 4 r fk f 2 wk d j 0 2 js 2 j 1 s 4 r fk f 2 wk d c j 0 2 js 2 cs 2 this proves that s 4 r fk f
