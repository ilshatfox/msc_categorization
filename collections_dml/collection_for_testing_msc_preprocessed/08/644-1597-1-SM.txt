molodtsov 16 and is proved an efficient tool to handle the complications of modeling uncertain data in many fields as compared to the classical methods to increase the usefulness of soft sets numerous operations have been introduced and applied in the literature e g 2 18 etc subsequently n cagmen et al have redefined the various operations of molodtsov s soft sets which proved more efficient for the development of number of new results in soft set theory number of algebraic soft structures have been explored such as soft groups 3 soft rings 1 soft semirings 8 soft nearrings 17 recently we first author with a rehman have introduced and discussed soft nearsemirings 10 further to this soft intersection group soft int group 5 soft intersection rings soft int rings 6 soft intersection near

important role in the theory of automata and computer languages in 2005 krishna and chatterjee 13 discussed the condition of minimality of generalized linear sequential machines using the theory of nearsemirings we call a system r is a right nearsemiring if i r is a monoid ii r is a semigroup iii a b c a c b c for all a b c in r nearsemiring is said to be a zero symmetric if there exist 0 r such that 0 a a 0 a and 0 a a 0 0 some authors use the term of seminearrings for zero symmetric nearsemirings a nonempty subset i of a nearsemiring r is said to be a left right ideal if i for all x y i x y

m n si ideals with illustrative examples we apply different soft set operations to these newly established soft structures for the sake of investigations throughout we assume that m n u definition 9 let r be a nearsemiring and fr be a soft set over u then fr is called an m n soft intersection nearsemiring m n si nearsemiring of a nearsemiring r over u if it satisfies the following properties 1 fr x y m fr x fr y n 2 fr xy m fr x fr y n for all x y r example 1 let us consider u d 6 e a a 2 b ab a 2 b and a right nearsemiring r 0 x y defined by the following tables 0 x y 0 0 x y x x x y y y y y 0 x y 0 0 x y x x x y y y x y we assume that r is the set of parameters and u d 6 we construct a soft set over u as fr 0 e a b ab fr x a b ab fr y a b let us take m e a and n u then it is easy to verify that the soft set fr is an m n si nearsemiring remark 1 if fr is a soft intersection nearsemiring over u then fr is an u si nearsemiring of r over u thus every si nearsemiring is an m n si nearsemiring however the converse is not true in general example 2 let us consider that u d 6 e a a 2 b ab a 2 b and a left nearsemiring r 0 x y z defined by the following tables 0 x y z 0 0 x y z x x

over u as fr 0 e a 2 b a 2 b fr x a b ab fr y a a 2 b and fr z a 2 a 2 b then one can easily prove that fr is an m n si nearsemiring of r over u however fr xy fr 0 e a 2 b a 2 b fr a fr b a b thus fr is not a soft int nearsemiring over u corollary 1 it is easy to verify that if fr x u for all x r then fr is a m n si nearsemiring we will abbreviate such m n si nearsemiring by r lobachevskii journal of mathematics m n soft intersection nearsemirings and its algebraic applications 5 the following results can be easy to verify proposition 1 1 if fr and hr are two m n si nearsemirings of r over u then fr hr is also an m n si nearsemiring u 2 if fr and gr are two m n si nearsemirings of r over u then fr gr is also an m n si nearsemiring 3 if fr ht are two m n si nearsemirings ofr over the same universal set u then fr ht is also a soft an are two m n si nearsemirings of r over the same universal set u u however if fr and ft are two m n si nearsemirings of r over the same universal set u then fr ft need not be a m n si nearsemiring we demonstrate this in example 3 example 3 let us consider u d 8 e a a 2 a 3 b ab a 2 b a 3 b and two nearsemirings r 0 x y and t 0 x y z t defined by the

x y y t z 0 x y y t t 0 x y y t we assume that r and t are the set of parameters u d 8 and m a b n u we construct fr 0 e a b ab fr x a b ab and fr y a b then it is easy to verify that fr is an m n si nearsemiring u similarly consider a nearsemiring t 0 x y z t and we construct ft 0 d 8 ft x e a b ab ft y e a 2 b a 2 b ft z e b and ft t e a a 2 b clearly ft is an m n si nearsemiring let x z y 0 r t

a nearsemiringr is distributively generated and having multiplicative identity then fr hr r 6 theorem 1 let r be a commutative distributively generated nearsemiring with multiplicative identity and fr be the soft set over u then fr is an m n si nearsemiring of r over u iff fr r 1 r 2 m fr r 1 fr r 2 n and fr m fr fr n for all r 1 r 2 r proof we assume that fr be an m n si nearsemiring of r over u then fr r 1 r 2 m fr r 1 fr r 2 n let r n i 1 xiyi such that fr fr r then it is easy to verify let fr fr r 6 then fr fr r n r n i 1 xiyi fr xi fr yi n r n i 1 xiyi fr xiyi m r n i 1 xiyi fr r m fr r m hence fr m fr fr n conversely let fr r 1 r 2 m fr r 1 fr r 2 n and fr m fr fr n for all r 1 r 2 r then fr r 1 r 2 m fr fr r 1 r 2 n r 1 r 2 n i 1 xiyi fr xi fr yi n fr r 1 fr r 2 n hence fr is an m n

then we call fs an m n si subnearsemiring of r over u and is denoted by fs m n i fr example 4 let us consider u d 8 e a a 2 a 3 b ab a 2 b a 3 b and a right nearsemiringr 0 x y z t defined by the

table 3 s 0 y z t is a right sub nearsemiring of r we take s as a set of parameters e s u d 8 and m e b n u then we construct fs 0 d 8 fs y fs t e a 2 b and fs z e b which is an m n si nearsemiring of r over u evidently fs m n i fr proposition 2 let fr is an m n si nearsemiring over u if fs m n i fr and ft m n i fr over u then fs ft m n i fr over u definition 12 let r be a nearsemiring and fr be a

left and right ideal of r over u then we call a fr is an m n si ideal of r over u however we may also define a two sided m n si ideal of r over u as follows definition 13 let r be a nearsemiring and fr be a soft set over u then fr is an m n si ideal of r over u if it satisfies the following properties 1 fr x y m fr x fr y n 2 fr xy m fr x fr y n for all x y r we highlight the relationship between

then fr gt is a soft left right c int ideal over u 2 let fr and hr be two m n si left right c ideals of nearsemiring r over u then fr hr is also m n si left right c ideal of r over u definition 16 let fr gr be the two soft sets over u we define soft intersection c product of fr and gr as follows fr c hr r x y a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 y x fr ai gr bi i 1 2 if x is expressible as x y a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 y x otherwise theorem 3 let fr be an m n si right c ideal and gr be an m n si left c ideal over u then fr gr m fr c gr n proof let x r if fr c gr x then trivially completes the proof let us consider fr c

thus if m n u then f r f m n r case 2 if m n u let m 1 and n 2 3 4 5 6 7 then one can easily check that f r 2 3 and f r 1 2 3 however f m n r 1 fr 1 m n and hence f m n r f r lobachevskii journal of

nearsemiring r whenever it is non empty proof let f m n r 6 let x y f m n r then fr x m n fr y m n and fr x y m fr x fr y n fr x n fr y n n n n thus x y f m n r similarly one can easily show that fr xy m fr x fr y n it follows that xy f m n r thus f m n r is a sub nearsemiring theorem 5 let fr be a soft set over u and m n u then fr is an m n si left right ideal of r over u iff f m n r is a left right ideal of r such that f m n r 6 proof assume that m n u let fr is an m n si left ideal of r over u consider a b f m n r fr a m n and fr b m n it follows that fr a b m fr a fr b n n hence a b f m

suppose that f m n r is a left ideal of r such that f m n r 6 let a b f m n r such that n fr a fr b n for each a b r a b f m n r thus fr a b m n fr a fr b n also for each a f m n r such that fr a we get ra f m n r fr ra m fr a n thus fr is an m n si left ideal of r over u theorem 6 let fr be a soft set over u and m n u then fr is an m n si left right c ideal of r over u if and only if f m n r is a left right c ideal of r such that f m n r 6 proof assume that m n u refer to theorem 5 in which we have proved that fr is an m n si left right ideal of r over u if and only if f m n r is a left right ideal of r for any u such that f m n r 6 suppose that fr is an m n si left right ideal ofr over u let a b f m n r and x y r such that x y a b y x since a b f m n r implies that fr a m n and fr b m n also we have fr x m fr a fr b n then fr x m n so x f m n r hence f m n r is a left c ideal of r lobachevskii journal of mathematics 12 w a khan 1 b davvaz 2 and a muhammad 3 conversely let f m n r be the left c ideal of r such that f m n r 6 let a b x y r such that x y a b y x suppose fr a 1 fr b 2 and 1 2 n where i u then a f m n r and b f m n r since f m n r is a left c ideal of r we have x f

using soft sets along with intersection and union operation of sets we have also introduced m n si subnearsemirings m n si left ideal and m n si c ideals of a nearsemirings with illustrative examples we also introduced the notion of m n inclusion of soft sets and applied to m n si ideals to extend this study one can further study the other algebraic structures on this pattern conflict of interest
