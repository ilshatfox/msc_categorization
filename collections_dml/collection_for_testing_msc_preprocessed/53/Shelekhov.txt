7 2017 abstract on the boundaries of the first and second kind of curvilinear three web configurations are defined that are analogous to the known thomsen and bol configurations this makes it possible

three web boundaries of a curvilinear three web configu rations on a three web differential invariants of a 3 web regular three web 1 introduction let 1 2 3 be 3 smooth families of curves in the plane d be the maximum possible domain of the plane such that each of its points has a neighborhood in which a each of the families forms a foliation b families of lines have no singularities and are pairwise transversal then we say that the families form a three web w in the domain d and the domain d is called the domain of definition of the 3 web or the domain of its transversality points the families are defined at but the lines of the families or families themselves have singularities form the set of singularities of the three web w in particular points the leaves of 3 web w are tangent at do not fall into the domain d and the leaves common to two or three families do not fall in 1 we introduced boundary curves of the first kind at the points of which the lines of the families and are tangent in particular if the lines of two families coincide then this common line is called the boundary curve of the second kind the differential topological theory of three webs studies them up to local diffeomorphisms preserving only incidence of points or lines of a three web 2 therefore the main object of observation in this theory are configurations formed by three web lines reidemeister thomsen blaschke and bol introduced various configurations r t h b later generalized to multidimensional three webs a necessary and sufficient condition for the closure of all sufficiently small configurations of the same type is equivalent to the vanishing of some relative differential invariant that is a tensor thus the classification of three webs by the closure conditions and not only on them is connected with the finding of relative differential invariants 1 note that in terms of relative differential invariants many important problems in the web theory have been solved for example the well known problem of linearizability of three webs see 3 the main relative invariants of a curvilinear three web are its curvature expressed in terms of derivatives up to the third order of the web function and the web curvature covariant derivatives 1 2 the geometric meaning of curvature is that it determines the main part of the obstuction to the closure of three webs configurations if the curvature is zero in the domain d then all the classical configurations on the curvilinear three web are closed such a web is equivalent to a web formed by three families of parallel straight lines and is called parallelizable hexagonal regular e mail amshelekhov yandex ru 1 absolute invariants are introduced in the framework of the differential topological theory of webs 1 but they do not have a geometric interpretation therefore the classification of webs in accordance with absolute invariants is difficult since there is no way to describe the geometric properties of the corresponding classes 2 a m shelekhov but the classical sufficiently small configuration of the web and its curvature are defined only in the domain d that is outside its boundaries meanwhile the boundaries play an important role in the curvilinear web theory as shown in 1 a three web is regular if and only if its boundary curves are lines of this web therefore the study of the geometry of webs near the boundaries seems to us an urgent problem in the recent paper 4 absolute differential invariants of curvilinear three webs defined on its boundaries were introduced in this paper we introduce an analogue of the hexagonal configuration defined at the points of the boundary curve of the first kind an analogue of the right bol configuration for the boundary curve of the second kind and we find the corresponding relative differential invariants that are like the curvature the main part of the obstruction to closure of the introduced configurations here we use a simple but effective technique of computations used by chern in 5 to find the necessary and sufficient conditions for the closure of classical figures on a multidimensional three web all functions considered in this paper are assumed to be real analytic 2 pentagonal configurations on the boundary of the first kind it is known 1 that every three web is equivalent locally diffeomorphic to a three web whose two families form a cartesian net we can always assume that in a neighbourhood of a point in the domain d the third family is the level lines of some function f x y then the web equation that connects the parameters of the web lines through a point has the form z f x y the function f is called the web function in fig 1 we can see the thomsen configuration t we are going to construct its analogue here the lines of the first and second families form the cartesian net and the lines of the third family represented by inclined lines the vertical horizontal and slanted lines are marked by the parameters x y and z respectively the figure t is constructed for example as follows we take two arbitrary lines x 1 and y 1 from the first and second families then we draw the sloping lines z 1 and z 2 sufficiently close to the point x 1 y 1 through the resulting intersection points we draw the vertical and horizontal lines x 2 and y 2 x 3 and y 3 as shown in fig 1 we obtain points a and b the resulting configuration is called the thomsen figure or t if the points a and b lie on one line of the third family of web then we say that the figure t is closed x x x y y y z z z a b 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 figure 1 thomsen configuration in particular if the lines x 2 y 2 and z 2 pass through a common point then the thomsen configuration is called a hexagonal configuration or figure h one of the main theorems of the three web theory is the following the three web w is regular if and only if all sufficiently small figures h are closed on it since the third family of web lines consists of level lines of the function f the boundary 13 at the points the lines of the first and third families are tangent to is given by the equation f y 0 1 lobachevskii journal of mathematics configurations on three web boundaries 3 let o be an arbitrary point on 13 we choose the coordinates so that the point o has zero coordinates then in a neighbourhood of this point the curve of the third family lies on one side of the vertical line x 0 that is a line of the first family of web w see fig 2 we parametrize the third family so that the equation of the line has the form f x y 0 let p x 0 be an arbitrary point on the line of the second family y 0 that is sufficiently close to o see fig 2 then the vertical line of the web through p intersects at the points p 1 x y 1 and p 2 x y 2 the horizontal web lines through p 1 and p 2 intersect the y axis at the points p 3 and p 4 respectively let the curves of the third family through p 3 and p 4 intersect the axis x at the points a x 1 0 and b x 2 0 respectively y 0 o a b pp p p p x y y 1 3 4 1 2 2 figure 2 pentagonal configuration p 13 the constructed pentagonal configuration is denoted by p 13 it can be regarded as an analogue of the configuration h for the boundary 13 we estimate the difference x 2 x 1 up to the fourth order first of all note that in view of 1 f y 0 0 0 therefore in a neighbourhood of the point o we have the expansion f x y fx 0 0 x 1 2 fxx 0 0 x 2 fxy 0 0 xy fyy 0 0 y 2 1 6 fxxx 0 0 x 3 1 2 fxxy 0 0 x 2 y 1 2 fxyy 0 0 xy 2 1 6 fyyy 0 0 y 3 o 4 2 since the points o and p 1 lie on the line we have f 0 0 f x y 1 or 0 fx 0 0 x 1 2 fxx 0 0 x 2 fxy 0 0 xy 1 fyy 0 0 y 1 2 1 6 fxxx 0 0 x 3 1 2 fxxy 0 0 x 2 y 1 1 2 fxyy 0 0 x y 1 2 1 6 fyyy 0 0 y 1 3 3 the symbol means that the calculations are carried out up to the fourth order terms in what follows we write fx instead of fx 0 0 and so on it is clear from 3 that we can put x fyy 2 fx y 1 2 v y 1 3 4 lobachevskii journal of mathematics 4 a m shelekhov substituting into 3 we find v fxyfyy 2 fx 2 fyyy 6 fx 5 similar conclusions are obtained for the point p 2 x fyy 2 fx y 2 2 v y 2 3 6 let f x y c be the line of the third family through the points p 3 0 y 1 and a x 1 0 then f 0 y 1 f x 1 0 or by virtue of 2 1 2 fyy y 1 2 1 6 fyyy y 1 3 fxx 1 1 2 fxx x 1 2 1 6 fxxx x 1 3 hence we get x 1 1 fx 1 2 fyy y 1 2 1 6 fyyy y 1 3 similarly we find x 2 1 fx 1 2 fyy y 2 2 1 6 fyyy y 2 3 from the last two equalities we have x 2 x 1 fyy 2 fx y 2 2 y 1 2 fyyy 6 fx y 2 3 y 1 3 7 on the other hand from 4 and 6 we find fyy 2 fx y 2 2 y 1 2 v y 2 3 y 1 3 substituting into 7 taking into account 5 we obtain x 2 x 1 v fyyy 6 fx y 2 3 y 1 3 fxyfyy 2 fx 2 y 2 3 y 1 3 thus the main part of the difference x 2 x 1 is of order 3 and is determined by the quantity 13 fxyfyy fx 2 8 where the values of the derivatives are calculated at an arbitrary point of the boundary 13 it follows that 13 is a relative invariant of the three web w on the boundary of the first kind 13 we proved theorem 1 let the three web w be formed by the cartesian net and the level lines of the function f then the main part of the obstruction to the closure of the figure p 13 constructed on the boundary of the first kind 13 is determined by the relative invariant 13 computed at the points of this boundary by the formula 8 the similar relative invariant on the boundary 23 will be 23 fxyfxx fy 2 3 analogue of bol configuration on the boundary of the second kind let the line x 0 be the common line of the first and third families that is the line is the boundary 13 of the second kind of the 3 web w given by the cartesian net and some family of lines f x y c 0 let the line x 0 have the parameter c 0 then f x y c x a x y c b x y c 2 9 we place the origin in an arbitrary point of the axis y and construct fig 3 we choose an arbitrary point p x 0 draw a line of the third family through it take an arbitrary point p 1 x 1 y on the latter and take x and y close to zero next on axis x we take the point p x 0 draw the line of the third family through it take the point p 2 x 2 y on it through the points p 1 and p 2 we draw the vertical lines of the lobachevskii journal of mathematics configurations on three web boundaries 5 web w then we obtain the points p 3 x 1 0 and p 4 x 2 0 respectively through the points p and p we draw vertical lines of the web w through the points p 3 and p 4 draw inclined lines we obtain the points p 5 x y 1 and p 6 x y 2 respectively the constructed configuration coincides with the well known right bol figure br 1 the fundamen tal difference between this figure and the classical one is that in the latter the left and right parts are not separated by the boundary that is they lie in one connected part of the domain d of the 3 web w the configuration in fig 3 we denote by b 13 if the constructed configuration is closed then y 1 y 2 therefore the main part of the difference y 1 y 2 is a relative invariant of the 3 web w y 0 o p pp p x y y 1 3 6 12 2 x p 4 p 5 pp figure 3 analogue of the bol configuration b 13 we compute y 1 and y 2 assuming the figureb 13 to be sufficiently small this means that the quantities x y defining this figure and the parameters of the lines of the third family entering into it should be assumed to be close to zero we write down the conditions for the pairs of points p and p 1 p 3 and p 5 p and p 2 p 4 and p 6 to belong to the same curve of the third family 1 f x 0 c 1 0 f x 1 y c 1 0 2 f x 0 c 2 0 f x 2 y c 2 0 3 f x 1 0 c 3 0 f x y 1 c 3 0 4 f x 2 0 c 4 0 f x y 2 c 4 0 10 it is clear from 9 that fc x y 0 a x y fx x y 0 1 all the other derivatives of f with respect to the variables x and y for c 0 that is on the boundary 13 being equal to zero let the series expansion of a x y be written as a x y a 0 a 1 x a 2 y a 11 x 2 a 12 xy a 22 y 2 a 111 x 3 a 112 x 2 y a 122 xy 2 a 222 y 3 11 we assume that a 0 0 that is the quantities x and y are small relative to a x y then up to the second order members we obtain from 9 and 10 1 x a x 0 c 1 0 x 1 a x 1 y c 1 0 and xa x 1 y x 1 a x 0 12 we look for x 1 in the form x 1 u 0 u 1 x u 2 y u 11 x 2 substituting in the previous equation and using 11 after some calculations we get the following formula lemma 1 x 1 x a 2 a 0 xy a 12 a 0 x 2 y a 22 a 0 xy 2 a 112 a 0 a 2 a 11 a 20 x 3 y a 122 a 0 a 2 a 12 a 20 x 2 y 2 a 222 a 0 xy 3 13 lobachevskii journal of mathematics 6 a m shelekhov from 10 2 we similarly find xa x 2 y x 2 a x 0 this equality is obtained from 17 by replacing the variable x by x so the following is true lemma 2 x 2 x a 2 a 0 xy a 12 a 0 x 2 y a 22 a 0 xy 2 a 112 a 0 a 2 a 11 a 20 x 3 y a 122 a 0 a 2 a 12 a 20 x 2 y 2 a 222 a 0 xy 3 the third equality 10 gives xa x 1 0 x 1 a x y 1 substituting here x 1 from 18 and solving with respect to y 1 we obtain the following result lemma 3 y 1 y u 22 y 2 u 122 xy 2 u 222 y 3 where u 22 a 2 a 0 2 a 22 a 2 u 122 2 a 122 a 2 2 a 12 a 22 a 22 consider the fourth equality 10 it is obtained from the second one by replacing x by x in the right hand side and by changing x 1 to x 2 in the left hand side but x 2 is obtained from x 1 also by replacing x by x therefore y 2 is obtained from y 1 also by replacing x by x that is the following is true lemma 4 y 2 y u 22 y 2 u 122 xy 2 u 222 y 3 from the above we get y 1 y 2 2 u 122 xy 2 2 13 xy 2 so the quantity 13 2 a 122 a 2 2 a 12 a 22 a 22 14 is a relative invariant of the three web on the 2 kind boundary 13 we have proved theorem 2 let the three web be formed by the cartesian net and family of curves 9 so that the y axis is the boundary curve of the second kind 13 then the main part of the obstruction to the closure of the figure b 13 constructed on the boundary 13 is determined by the relative invariant 13 calculated at every point of this boundary by formula 14 4 calculation of the invariant 13 we express 13 in terms of partial derivatives of the function a from 11 we obtain a 2 ay 0 0 a 12 axy 0 0 2 a 22 ayy 0 0 2 a 122 axyy 0 0 substituting in the second formula 14 we obtain 13 ayaxyy axyayy a 2 y axy ay y ln ay xy all derivatives being computed at point 0 0 and the last equality is possible in a domain where ay 0 but since 0 0 is an arbitrary point of axis y we can write 13 ln ay xy c 0 15 on the other hand it follows from 9 that for c 0 fc a x y fcy a x y y fcxy a x y xy fcyy a x y yy fcxyy a x y xyy therefore for c 0 ln ay xy lnfcy xy and 15 takes the form 13 lnfcy xy c 0 16 let us find the form of the invariant 13 for the case when the third family is given by the level lines of the function f x y then the identity f x y f x y 0 is fulfilled differentiating it we obtain lobachevskii journal of mathematics configurations on three web boundaries 7 fx fcfx 0 since fx 1 fc a for c 0 from the previous formulas we have 1 afx 0 for c 0 as a result formula 15 takes the form 13 ln 1 fx y xy c 0 for the boundary 23 of the second kind we can construct an analogous figureb 23 and find analogous formulas for the corresponding relative invariant 5 the necessary condition for the p 13 closure the necessary condition for the closure of the figure p 13 is that the relative invariant 13 vanishes which gives the equality fxyfyy 0 that must be satisfied at the points of the boundary of the first kind 13 1 consider the case fxy 0 17 if condition 17 is satisfied at every point of the web domain then f x y and the web is regular 2 if condition 17 is satisfied on the boundary 13 given by the equation fy 0 then the condition fxy fy x y 0 x y 0 18 must be fulfilled solutions of equation 18 can be obtained as follows we set fy p x y k k 0 1 then fxy kp k 1 px k fy k 1 k px and condition 18 is satisfied in this case the boundary 13 is given by the equation p 0 and the function f can be found by integration the three web w in this case will not in general be regular 2 the case fyy 0 19 if condition 19 is satisfied at every point of the web domain d then the web equation has the form z a x y b x and in the plane of variables y z it defines a rectilinear three web w obtained from the web w by renumbering foliations and formed by the cartesian net y const z const and the family of straight lines z a x y b x with parameter x if 19 is satisfied on the boundary 13 then the condition fyy fy x y 0 x y 0 must be fulfilled solutions of this equation can be found similarly to 1 6 the necessary condition for the b 13 closure the necessary condition for the closure of the figure b 13 is that the relative invariant 13 on the boundary 13 its equation is x 0 is equal to zero suppose that the web is given by equation 9 then we obtain from 16 lnfcy xy c 0 0 20 if the equality lnfcy xy 0 is satisfied at every point of domain d then after integration we obtain f x c x y x 21 where x y 0 in d otherwise the web does not exist the three web defined in this case by the equation f 0 has not only the boundary 13 of the second kind x 0 but also the boundary 13 of the first kind defined by the equation y 0 outside the boundary x 0 the web equation f 0 can be written in the form c 1 x 1 x y x 0 or after admissible substitutions of variables c 1 z x 1 x x y y in the form z xy x generally speaking this web is not regular and will be such if x is a linear function note that the last equation determines a rectilinear three web in the plane of the variables y and z in accordance with 21 the solution of equation 20 can be written in the form f x c x y x 2 x y c 2 3 x y c 3 lobachevskii journal of mathematics 8 a m shelekhov 7 on the sufficient condition for the b 13 closure the necessary closure conditions for the figures p 13 and b 13 are not generally speaking sufficient let us find for example a sufficient condition for the closure of the figures b 13 for the web 21 first we make an admissible substitution y y then the web equation takes the form x c x y x 0 21 and the closure conditions 10 are written in the form 1 x x c 1 0 x 1 x 1 y x 1 c 1 0 2 x x c 2 0 x 2 x 2 y x 2 c 2 0 3 x 1 x 1 c 3 0 x x y 1 x c 3 0 4 x 2 x 2 c 4 0 x x y 2 x c 4 0 since the configuration lines are outside the domain c 0 x 0 we find from these relations 1 x x x 1 x 1 y x 1 x 1 2 x x x 2 x 2 y x 2 x 2 3 x 1 x 1 x x y 1 x x 4 x 2 x 2 x x y 2 x x 22 adding the first and the third equalities then the second to the fourth ones we obtain equalities x 1 x 1 y x x y 1 0 x 2 x 2 y x x y 2 0 a necessary and sufficient condition for the closure y 1 y 2 is satisfied in the case when x 1 x 1 x x x 2 x 2 x x or x 1 x 1 x x 2 x 2 x the values of x 1 and x 2 can be found from the first two equations 22 x 1 x y x 2 x y then the previous equality takes the form x y x y x x y x y x so the necessary and sufficient closure condition is that the function be skew symmetric remark the construction of figures p 13 and b 13 is impossible if the web exists only on one side of the boundary for example if three web is given by the equation z x 2 y 2
