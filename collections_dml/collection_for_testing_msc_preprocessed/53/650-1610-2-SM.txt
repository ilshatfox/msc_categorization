kenmotsu manifold and we analyzed the nature of ricci solitons when associated vector field is orthagonal to reeb vector field 1 introduction a ricci soliton is a riemannian metric g on a manifold m together with a vector field v such that lvg x y 2 s x y 2 g x y 0 1 1 where lv denotes the lie derivative along v and s and are respectively ricci tensor and a constant a ricci soliton is said to be shrinking or steady or expanding according as is negative zero or positive a ricci soliton is said to be a gradient ricci soliton if the vector field v is gradient of some smooth function f on m r
