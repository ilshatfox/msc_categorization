ricci solitons on three dimensional normal almost contact metric manifolds krishanu mandal and sourav makhal abstract the purpose of the paper is to study ricci solitons and gradient ricci solitons on three dimensional normal almost contact metric manifolds first we prove that if a non cosymplectic normal almost contact metric manifold with constant of dimension three admits a ricci soliton then the manifold is ricci flat provided 6 0 and 6 further we prove that if a normal almost contact metric manifold with constant of dimension three admits gradient ricci soliton then the manifold is einstein provided 2 2 6 0 1 introduction a ricci soliton is a generalization of an einstein metric a riemannian metric g defined on a smooth manifold m of dimension n is said to be a ricci soliton if there exists a vector field v and a constant such that 1 1 v g 2 ric 2 g 0 where v denotes the lie derivative in the direction of v and ric is the ricci tensor of g this is considered as a generalization of einstein metric and often arises as a fixed point of hamiltons ricci flow t g t 2 ric g t where g t is a one parameter family of metrics on m de et al 7 studied ricci soliton and

solitons gradient ricci solitons normal almost contact metric man ifolds 1 2 k mandal and s makhal the notion of ricci solitons on almost hermitian manifolds was introduced by tachibana 16 in 1959 hamada 10 studied ricci flat real hypersurfaces in non flat complex space forms the ricci tensor in contact metric manifold is given by 9 1 2 s x y 1 2 trace r x y where q is the ricci operator recently kaimakamis and panagiotidou 12 introduced the notion of ricci soliton where they essentialy modified the definition of ricci soliton by replacing the ricci tensor ric in 1 1 with the ricci tensor ric definition 1 1 9 a riemannian metric g on m is called a ricci soliton if 1 3 v g x y 2 ric x y 2 g x y 0 where is a constant and v is a vector field definition 1 2 9 a riemannian metric g

relation 1 5 s x y g x y where is a constant ghosh and patra 9 studied ricci solition in the frame work of sasakian and k contact manifold recently majhi et al 13 studied ricci solitons and gradient ricci solitons on three dimensional sasakian manifold motivated by the above studies in the present paper we consider ricci solition and gradient ricci soliton on three dimensional normal almost contact manifolds the paper is structured as follows after preliminary in sections 3 and 4 we study ricci solitons and gradient ricci solitons on three dimensional normal almost contact metric manifolds respectively 2 preliminaries let m be an almost contact manifold and its almost contact structure then m is an odd dimensional smooth manifold and carries a 1 1 tensor a vector field and a 1 form satisfying 1 ricci solitons 3 i 2 x x x for all x m ii 1 0 0 let t be a coordinate on r where r is the real line define an almost complex structure j on m r by j x d dt x x d dt where the pair x d dt denotes a tangent vector to m r x and d dt being tangent to m and r respectively if j is integrable then m with the structure is said to be normal or equivalently if 2 d 0 where the pair is the nijenhuis tensor of define by x y 2 x y x y x y x y forx y m we say that the form has rank r 2 s if d s 6 0 and d s 0 and has rank r 2 s 1 if d s 6 0 and d s 1 0 we also say that r is the rank of the structure a riemannian metric g on m is said to be compatible with the structure if the metric g satisfy the condition 2 1 g x y g x y x y and 2 2 g x x for x y m if the metric g is compatible with the structure then the quadruplet g is called an almost contact metric structure on m and m is an almost contact metric manifold for an almost contact metric manifold we can define the 2 form by 2 3 x

the manifold is either sasakian or kenmotsu 11 or cosympletic 1 from 2 7 we have r x y z r 2 2 2 2 g y z x g x z y g x z r 2 3 2 2 y g y z r 2 3 2 2 x 2 8 using 2 8 we obtain g r x y z w r 2 2 2 2 g y

get 2 11 q y r 2 2 2 2 y y from 2 10 we can state the following proposition 2 1 a three dimensional normal almost contact metric manifold m 3 g is ricci flat if and only if r 4 2 2 ricci solitons 5 the following lemma is very crucial for the next results lemma 2 1 on a three dimensional normal almost contact metric manifold m 3 g we have 2 12 r 4 r 2 3 2 2 proof from 2 7 we obtain 2 13 s x y r 2

r 2 3 2 2 x substituting x with in the above equation we get r 4 r 2 3 2 2 this completes the proof 3 ricci solitons on normal almost contact metric manifolds in this section we study ricci solitons on normal almost contact metric manifolds applying 2 10 in 1 3 we get 3 1 v g x y 2 r 2 2 2 2 g x y r 2 2 2 2 x y taking covariant differentiation of 3 1 with respect to any vector field z we have z v

since g is parallel with respect to the levi civita connection then the above formula becomes 3 4 x v g y z g v x y z g v x z y since v is 1 2 type symmetric tensor then it follows from 3 4 that 2 g v x y z x v g y z y v g x z z v g x y 3 5 applying 3 2 in 3 5 yields 2 g v x y z xr g y z y z 2 r 2 2 2 2 g x y z g z x y 2 x y z g y x z g z x y y r g x z x z 2 r 2 2 2 2 g x y z g z y x g x y z g z y

3 9 with respect to any vector field y yields y v x r 4 2 2 y x 2 r 2 3 2 2 y x v x y v x y 3 10 again we know that 3 11 vr x y z x v y z y v x z using 3 10 and 3 11 we have vr x 2 2 r 4 2 2 x x 2 r 5 2 2 x 3 12 setting y in 1 3 we obtain 3 13 v g x 2 x now lie differentiating the equation 2 2 along v and using the equation 3 13 we have 3 14 v 0 now from 2 7 we get 3 15 r x 2 2 x x lie differentiating the equation 3 15 and applying 3 13 3 14 we infer 3 16 vr x 6 2 2 x equating 3 16 and 3 10 we have 6 2 2 x 2 2 r 4 2 2 x x 2 r 5 2 2 x 3 17 substituting x in 3 17 we get 3 18 2 2 0 then either 0 or let us consider 0 now taking the inner product with y of 3 17 we obtain 2 2 r 4 2 2 g x y x y 2 r 5 2 2 g x y 6 2 2 x y 0 3 19 8 k mandal and s makhal substituting x y ei in 3 19 and summing over i 1 to 3 and using 0 we infer that 3 20 r 4 2 2 2 0 which implies that r 4 2 2 provided 6 0 from the above discussions we can state the following theorem 3 1 if a non cosymplectic normal almost contact metric manifold with constant of dimension three admits a ricci soliton then the manifold is ricci flat provided 6 0 and 6 4 gradient ricci solitons on normal almost contact metric manifolds let m g be a three dimensional normal almost contact metric manifold and g a gradient ricci soliton then 1 4 reduces to 4 1 ydf q y y for any y m where d denotes the gradient operator of g from 4 1 it follows that 4 2 r x y df xq y yq x taking covariant differentiation of 2 11 along arbitrary vector field x and using 2 5 we have xq y xr 2 y y r 2 2 2 2 g x y g y x 2 x y y x 4 3 using 4 2 and 4 3 infer r x y df xr 2 y y y r 2 x x r 2 2 2 2 x y y x 2 g y x 4 4 from 4 4 we have 4 5 g r y df 0 also from 2 7 it follows that 4 6 r y df 2 2 g y df g df y taking inner product of 4 6 with gives 4 7 g r y df 2 2 g y df g df y ricci solitons 9 in view of 4 5 and 4 7 we have 4 8 2 2 g y df g df y 0 from 4 8 we have 4 9 df f provided 2 2 6 0 taking differentiation of 4 9 along any arbitrary vector field x we have xdf x f f x replacing x by x and taking inner product with y we have 4 10 g xdf y f g x y g x y x y interchanging x and y in the above equation yields 4 11 g ydf x f g x y g y x x y applying poincare s lemma on a contractible manifold all closed forms are exact therefore d 2 f x y 0 for all x y m from which we have xy f y x f x y f 0 that is xg gradf y y g gradf x g gradf x y 0 this is equivalent to xg gradf y g gradf xy y g gradf x g gradf yx 0 since g 0 the above equation yields g xgradf y g y gradf x 0 that is g xdf y g ydf x replacing x by x and y by y in the foregoing equation we obtain g xdf y g ydf x applying this in 4 10 and 4 11 we have f g x y 0 that is f d x y 0 since d 6 0 it follows that f 0 consequently from 4 9 we obtain df 0 this implies f is constant therefore from 4 1 we have s x y g x y for all vector field x and y this shows the manifold is an einstein manifold theorem 4 1 if a normal almost contact metric manifold with constant of dimension three admits gradient ricci soliton then the manifold is einstein provided 2 2 6 0 10 k mandal and s makhal references 1 blair d e contact manifolds in riemannian geometry lecture note in
