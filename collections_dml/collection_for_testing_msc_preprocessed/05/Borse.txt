introduced the point addition operation on graphs and used it to classify 4 connected graphs azanchiler 1 extended this operation to binary matroids as follows definition 1 1 let m be a binary matroid with ground set s and standard matrix rep resentation a over gf 2 let x x 1 x 2 xm s be an independent set in m and let 1 2 m be a set such that s suppose a is the matrix obtained from the matrix a by adjoining m columns labeled by 1 2 m such that the column labeled by i is same as the column labeled by xi for i 1 2 m let ax be the matrix obtained by adjoining one extra row to a which has entry 1 in the column labeled by i for i 1 2 m and zero elsewhere the vector matroid of the matrix ax denoted by mx is called as the extension of m and the transition from m to mx is called as extension operation on m an example given at the end of the paper illustrates the definition note that the ground set of the matroid mx is s and mx m therefore mx is an extension of m the extension operation is related to the splitting operation on binary matroids which is defined by shikare et al 11 as follows definition 2 11 let m be a binary matroid with standard matrix representation a over gf 2 and let y be a non empty set of elements of m let ay be the matrix obtained by adjoining one extra row to the matrix a whose entries are 1 in the columns labeled by the elements of the set y and zero otherwise the vector matroid of the matrix ay denoted by my is called as the splitting matroid of m with respect to y and the transition from m to my is called as the splitting operation with respect to y e mail ymborse 11 gmail com e mail ganumundhe gmail com 2 borse and mundhe let m be a binary matroid with ground set s and let x x 1 x 2 xm be an independent set in m obtain the extension m of m with ground set s where 1 2 m is disjoint from s such that xi i is a 2 circuit in m for each i the matroid m obtained from m by splitting the set is the extension matroid mx the splitting operation with respect to a pair of elements which is a special case of definition 1 2 was earlier defined by raghunathan et al 10 for binary matroids as an extension of the corresponding graph operation due to fleischner 7 whenever we write mx it is assumed that x is a non empty independent set of the matroid m azanchiler 1 characterized the circuits and the bases of the extension matroid mx in terms the circuits and bases of m respectively some results on preserving graphicness of m under the extension operation are obtained in 2 borse and mundhe 6 characterized the binary matroids m for which mx is graphic for any independent set x of m a k separation of a matroid m is a partition of its ground set s into two disjoint sets a and b such that min a b k and r a r b r m k 1 a matroid m is k connected if it does not have a k 1 separation also m is connected if it is 2 connected in general the splitting operation does not preserve the connectivity of a given matroid borse and dhotre 4 provided a sufficient condition to preserve connectedness of a matroid while borse 3 gave a sufficient condition to get a k connected matroid from given the k 1 connected binary matroid under the splitting with respect to a pair of elements borse and mundhe 5 and malwadkar et al 8 gave two characterizations for getting a k connected matroid from the given k 1 connected binary matroid by splitting with respect to any set of k elements the extension operation also does not give k connected matroid from the given k connected binary matroid in general azanchiler 1 obtained sufficient conditions to preserve 2 connectedness and 3 connectedness of a binary matroid under this operation in this paper we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions to preserve k connectedness under the extension operation for any integer k 2 we also give necessary and sufficient conditions to get a connected matroid from a disconnected binary matroid in terms of the extension operation 2 proofs we need some lemmas lemma 1 1 let m be a binary matroid with ground set s and let x be an independent set in m suppose mx is the extension of m with ground set s let r and r be the rank functions of m and mx respectively then i is independent in mx ii r a r a if a s iii r a r s a 1 if a intersects iv r mx r m 1 lemma 2 1 let m be a binary matroid with ground set s and let x be an independent set in m then z s is a circuit of mx if and only if one of the following conditions holds i z is a circuit of m ii z xi xj i j for some distinct elements xi xj of x and the corresponding elements i j of iii z j d xj where j with j even and d is a circuit of m containing the set xj xi x i j lemma 3 9 pp 273 let m be a k connected matroid with at least 2 k 1 elements then every circuit and every cocircuit of m contains at least k elements the next lemma is a consequence of 9 proposition 2 1 6 lobachevskii journal of mathematics on k connected extensions of binary matroids 3 lemma 4 3 let m be a matroid with ground set s and let y s such that r m y r m 1 then y contains a cocircuit of m the following result follows immediately from lemma 3 and lemma 4 corollary 1 let m be a k connected matroid with ground set s such that s 2 k 1 then r m y r m for any y s with y k we now give necessary and sufficient conditions to obtain a k connected matroid from the given k connected binary matroid as follows theorem 1 let k 2 be an integer and m be a k connected binary matroid with at least 2 k 1 elements and x be an independent set in m then the extension matroid mx is k connected if and only if x k and 2 k 4 proof suppose x k and 2 k 4 we prove that mx is k connected the ground set of mx is s where is disjoint from the ground set s of m since x k by lemma 1 i is independent in mx suppose r and r denote the rank functions of m and mx respectively assume that mx is not k connected then mx has a k 1 separation a b therefore a and b are non empty disjoint subsets of s such that s a b and further min a b k 1 and r a r b r mx k 2 1 as a and b are non empty each of them intersects s or or both we consider the three cases depending on whether a intersect only s or only or both and obtain a contradiction in each of these cases case i a intersects only as a b s a since is independent a is independent in mx consequently r a a k 1 suppose a then by lemma 1 iii and iv r b r s 1 r m 1 r mx therefore r b r mx hence r a r b r mx k 1 which contradicts 1 therefore a hence b s and r a k by lemma 1 ii and iv r b r s r s r m r mx 1 therefore r a r b r mx k 1 which is a contradiction to 1 case ii a intersects only s as a a s and b s a therefore by lemma 1 i and ii r a r a and r b r k suppose s a k 2 then by corollary 1 r a r m consequently by lemma 1 iv r a r b r mx r a r b r m 1 r b 1 k 1 which is a contradiction to 1 hence s a k 1 by lemma 1 ii and iii r s a r s a r b 1 therefore by inequality 1 r a r s a r m r a r b 1 r mx 1 k 2 this shows that a and s a gives a k 1 separation of m which is a contradiction to fact that m is k connected case iii a intersects both s and let s 1 a s and 1 a since b it intersects s or if b intersects only s or only then we get a contradiction by interchanging roles of a and b in case i and case ii therefore b intersects both s and let s 2 b s and 2 b then si and i for i 1 2 by lemma 1 ii and iii r s 1 r s 1 r a 1 and r s 2 r s 2 r b 1 by 1 r s 1 r s 2 r m r a 1 r b 1 r mx 1 k 3 hence if s 1 k 2 and s 2 k 2 then s 1 s 2 gives a k 2 separation of m a contradiction to fact that m is k connected consequently s 1 k 3 or s 2 k 3 lobachevskii journal of mathematics 4 borse and mundhe suppose s 1 k 3 as k 4 and 1 s 1 k 4 and s 1 k 3 1 thus a contains exactly one element say x of m further a k 1 4 1 3 we claim that r a 3 suppose r a 2 then a contains a circuit c of mx such that c 3 since is independent in mx c is not a subset of therefore c contains x and c x a x in the last row of the matrix ax which represents the matroid mx the columns corresponding to the elements of have entries 1 and rest of the entries in that row are zero as c is a circuit the sum of the columns of ax corresponding to the elements of c is zero over gf 2 this implies that c contains at least two elements of hence c x 1 2 for some 1 2 let x 1 and x 2 be elements of the matroid m corresponding to 1 and 2 respectively by lemma 2 ii c 1 x 1 x 2 1 2 is a circuit in mx since mx is a binary matroid the symmetric difference c c 1 x x 1 x 2 of the circuits c and c 1 contains a circuit say c 2 of mx hence c 2 is a circuit in mx m such that c 2 3 4 1 k 1 a contradiction by lemma 3 hence r a 3 since s 1 k 3 by corollary 1 r s 2 r s s 1 r m therefore by lemma 1 iii r b r s 2 1 r s 2 1 r m 1 r mx therefore r b r mx hence r a r b r mx r a 3 k 1 a contradiction to 1 suppose s 2 k 3 then as in the above paragraph we see that r b 3 k 1 and r a r mx and so r a r b r mx r b k 1 a contradiction to 1 thus we get contradictions in cases i ii and iii therefore mx is k connected conversely suppose mx is k connected the last row of the matrix ax which represents mx has 1 s in the columns corresponding to the set and zero elsewhere hence contains a cocircuit of mx by lemma 3 k and so x k by lemma 2 ii mx contains a 4 circuit therefore by lemma 3 k 4 this completes the proof we now give a necessary and sufficient condition to get a connected matroid mx from the discon nected matorid m if x is disjoint from a component d of m then it follows from lemma 2 that d is a component of mx also therefore to get a connected matroid mx from the disconnected matroid m it is necessary that x intersects every component of m in the following theorem we prove that this obvious necessary condition is also suffcient theorem 2 let m be a disconnected binary matroid and let x be an independent set in m then mx is connected if and only if every component of m intersects x proof let m 1 m 2 mr be the components of m suppose each mi intersects x let s be the ground set of m then the ground set of mx is s where s since each mi is connected in m and mx m each mi is connected in mx too therefore each mi is contained in a component of mx we show that all mi are contained in a single component of mx since m is disconnected it has at least two components and so r 2 let d be a component of mx containing m 1 and let j 2 3 r suppose x contains an element x 1 of m 1 and an element xj of mj suppose 1 and j are elements of corresponding to x 1 and xj respectively then by lemma 2 2 ii c x 1 xj 1 j is a 4 circuit in mx as c contains an element of the component d of mx c is contained in d therefore d contains the element xj of mj consequently mj is contained in d thus all components of m are contained in d therefore s d let be an arbitrary member of and let x be the member of x corresponding to then by lemma 2 2 ii and x belong to a 4 circuit say z of mx as x z d z d and so d therefore d consequently d is the only component of mx hence mx is connected the converse readily follows from the discussion prior to the statement of the theorem example 2 8 we illustrate theorem 1 by using the fano matroid f 7 the ground set of f 7 is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and the standard matrix representation of f 7 over gf 2 is as follows a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 lobachevskii journal of mathematics on k connected
