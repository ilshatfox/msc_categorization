algebraic concept of group grading arises naturally in considering the crossed products especially in the context of irreversible dynamical systems in the paper some general aspects concerning group graded systems and related algebras are considered in particular a functional description of a c algebra associated with an abelian group graded system is presented 2010 mathematical subject

recent years the attention of many specialists in operator algebras were focused on the construc tions of algebras associated with irreversible dynamical systems since the concept of the group crossed product can not be directly transferred to the semigroup case new methods are developed to avoid the arising difficulties it can be mentioned papers concerning the different aspects of algebras associated with semigroup systems some of them arise within the framework of algebraical structurs namely as corresponding to semigroups with certain properties see a recent detailed review of xin li with references in 11 others describe irreversible dynamical systems endomorphisms polymorphisms see e g 1 3 5 10 irreversible mappings see e g 9 or interactions see e g 6 7 involvment of the concept of graded algebra into consideration seems to be most promising in this regard as the first step a notion of group graded system arises which allows different interpretations group graded system is a c variant of fell bundle concept which was developed in detail by ruy exel and presented in the book 8 in his turn the mentioned work in the substantial part is a continuation of a large series of works of the author and others see e g 4 as one of the recent it should be noted that our purposes are a little differ from the accents of the book of exel who is mainly interested in partial actions on the contrary it seems that by applying the tools of graded systems the difficulties associated with the use of partial isometries usually accompanying the irreversible dynamical systems can be avoided in the present paper we prefer consider the main object as an involutive semigroup structured in a special way although almost all definitions are available in general case the main result is formulated for abelian groups we mention in text when this restriction is necessary e mail vicar instmath sci am e mail gsuren inbox ru 2 arzumanian and grigoryan the paper is arranged as follows in the first section preliminary definitions and facts are provided the next section is devoted to the modular structure on the graded systems under consideration since their main properties are based just on it and on the natural action of the dual group in the abelian case in the third section we consider the modular representations and associated algebras in a suitable hilbert module in the last section a theorem describing the reduced c algebra as an algebra of continuous functions on the dual group is presented we consider the work as an our first step in studying semigroup dynamical systems in pursuit to replace partial actions on a given c algebra by the actions of a suitable group on a modifying algebra equipped with complementary relations which should accumulate some problems arising in similar situations in a certain part we follow the contours of the paper 2 which was introductory in nature with some abbreviations new details explanations and corrections we exclude from consideration the important concept of graded c algebra and accordingly do not touch the connection between graded systems and algebras connected with semigroup systems 2 definitions and elementary properties let be a discrete group say with the unit e and a a multiplicative semigroup with zero we will say that a is equipped with a system a a of subsets of a if i a is a banach space for each ii a a iii a a 0 for each definition 1 a equipped star semigroup a a is called graded system if the opera tions of multiplication and involution on the semigroup are consistent with the operations on the banach spaces components of the system and i ab a for a a b a ii a a 1 for a a iii ab a b for a a b a iv a a a 2 a 2 for a a obviously the central algebra a ae is a c algebra as well as an involutive subsemigroup of the semigroup a remark 1 we suppose almost everywere that the initial semigroup is unital the reader himself will understand when such an assuming does not work e g when the considering system is an ideal definition 2 we say that a graded system b b is a subsystem of the graded system a a if b is a subsemigroup of a and for each the banach space b is a subspace of the banach space a a graded subsystem i i is called an ideal two sided of the system a a if it is an involutive two sided ideal of the semigroup a thus the central algebras b be and i ie are respectively a c subalgebra and an ideal of the central c algebra a when i is an ideal of the draded system a a standard equivalence relation can be defined on a in the following way elements a and b are equivalent a b if they are from the same a and a b i the equivalence relation is a congruence lobachevskii journal of mathematics functional description of c algebras 3 proof let a b with a b a and u v u v a then both au and bv are from a so au bv a u v a b v i and a b a b i 1 which means au bv and a b the corresponding quotient semigroup a i defined in the standard way presents a graded system composed of the quotient spaces a i as a morphism of a graded system a a into another graded system b a we understand the pair where is a group homomorphism and a b is a morphism of the semigroup a into the semigroup b such that a a for each and the restriction of on each a is linear let be a morphism a b of graded systems then the morphism does not increase the norm a a for any a a proof let a a then by the condition iv of definition 1 a 2 a a a a a a a 2 two graded systems are called isomorphic if the mappings and are bijective the group of automorphisms of a graded system a is denoted by aut a the standard action of the dual group of the group on the graded system can be characterized as follows let a be a graded system with abelian and g be the dual group of the group then for any g g the pair g id g where id is the identity map and g a g a for a a is an automorphism of the system a moreover the map g aut a is a faithful representation of the group g into the automorphism group of of a proof for g g a a and b a we have g ab g ab g g ab g a g b for g g a a g a g 1 a g a g a evidently g is linear on each a thus g aut a now let g h g and a a then gh a gh a g h a g h a let g h then g a h a for all a a and which means that g h remark 2 each ideal of a graded system is invariant under the standard action of the dual group lobachevskii journal of mathematics 4 arzumanian and grigoryan 3 modules let a be a graded system and b be a c algebra we consider a notion of b module graded system limiting ourselves to bimodules definition 3 let a a be a graded system b be a c algebra we say the system a is a b module if each a is a b module and the following consistency conditions satisfy modular multiplication is denoted as i b b b b ii b a b a b a ba iii b b b b for a b b a a the following four conditions follow immediately from the previous ones and complete all the possibilities with them iv b b b b v a b b a a b ab graded systems have the standard modular structure let a a be a graded system with the central algebra a then each a is an a module more precisely bimodule with respect the operations a a a a for a a a moreover the system a is also an a module proof we omit routine calculations the following proposition introduces the structure of hilbert a module on each a the space a with the inner product a 1 is a right hilbert a module denoted as h proof we give only a few obvious relations a a a a 2 then a right hilbert a module h a can be associated to the graded system a as a direct sum of the hilbert modules on the fibers the inner product in h a is determined as 2 for a remark 3 remind that a system a belongs to the hilbert module h a if the series is convergent in a it certainly holds if the series 2 converges denote 1 2 for a then h a means that the series 2 is conver gent and so the hilbert module h a associated to a graded system a may be considered as a non commutative l 2 a lobachevskii journal of mathematics functional description of c algebras 5 4 representations we consider group graded systems as something like a covariant system from this viewpoint the following concept is a continuation of this analogy definition 4 let a a be a graded system and h be a hilbert space we call a representation of the semigroup a in h a representation of the graded system a if it is linear on each a obviously the restriction of the representation onto the central algebra is a representation of the central c algebra a it is easy to verify that the kernel of any representation of a graded system is an ideal the following fact is an immediate consequence of the proposition 2 each representation of a graded system a satisfies the inequality a a 3 for a a the representation is faithful if and only if a a the uniformly closed involutive algebra c a generated by a in b h we call the c algebra associated to the graded system a for any hilbert b module h we denote by l h the algebra of all adjointable bounded b linear operators on h definition 5 let a a be a graded b module and h be a right hilbert b module a representation of the semigroup a in the algebra l h is called b representation of the system a if it is a b modular mapping on each space a the uniformly closed involutive algebra c a generated by a in l h is called the c algebra associated to the graded system a now we introduce a canonical a representation of a graded system a in the associated hilbert module h a theorem 1 the mapping specified on generators as r a a 4 for a a determines a faithful a representation of the system a in the associated hilbert a module h a proof it is easy to verify that r is a representation of the system a and then r a a by proposition 4 let us show that it is faithful for any a a a 0 we have by iv of definition 1 r a 1 r a a a 1 aa a 1 a 2 a definition 6 the representation r introduced via theorem 1 is called left regular representa tion of the graded system a the last result shows that a graded system can be realized as an operator system let us denote by c r a the uniformly closed subalgebra in l h a generated by the image of the regular representation of a graded system a thus a covariant functor could be defined from the category of graded systems with above mentioned morphisms to the category of c algebras with homomorphisms as morphisms lobachevskii journal of mathematics 6 arzumanian and grigoryan 5 functional description now we are ready to present a description of the c algebra associated with a graded system as the algebra of a valued mappings on the compactum g the dual group to the group for each a a let a continuous function a on g be defined as a g g a 5 and let a a a a denote also a a theorem 2 the system a is a graded system isomorphic to the system a and then the associated reduced c algebras c r a and c r a are isomorphic proof obviously a is an involutive subsemigroup of c g a each a is a banach space in sup norm a subspace of c g a by virtue of proposition 3 the only common element of these spaces is the zero function then a is a equipped system for a a and b a we have a b g a g b g g a g b g ab a b g and a g g a g a a g thus a a a and a a 1 which means that the first two conditions of definition 1 are satisfied the conditions iii and iv of the definition are evident since c g a is a c algebra again by proposition 3 we obtain that the mapping a a is a bijection which means that the graded systems a and a are isomorphic references 1 v arzumanian operator algebras associated with polymorphisms j of math sci 140 1 354 356 2007 2 v
