belarus abstract in this article under certain restrictions the convergence rate of type ii hermite pade approximants including nondiagonal ones for a system 1 f 1 1 jz kj 1 consisting of degenerate hypergeometric functions is found when j kj 1 are different complex numbers and c 0 1 2 without the indicated restrictions similar statements were obtained for approximants of the indicated type provided that the numbers j kj 1 are the roots of the equation k 1 the theorems proved in this paper complement and generalize the results obtained earlier by other authors 2010 mathematical subject

zk be the set of k dimensional multi indices k ordered nonnegative integers the sum m m 1 mk is an order of the multi index m m 1 mk also let us fix n z 1 multi index m m 1 mk zk and denote nj n m mj

we assume that 1 1 series of the form 1 are called hypergeometric series and their sums are called degenerate hypergeometric functions recall see 1 2 that the mittag leffler function is defined by the power series e z p 0 zp p 1 0 c and is a generalization of the exponential function taking into account the well known equality p p where just as in the previous formula z is the gamma function we can see that the functions 1 are mittag leffler functions therefore the coordinates of a vector function f f 1 z f k z are mittag leffler functions if 1 then the vector function f 1 is an ordered set of exponentials e jz kj 1 e mail svoitov gsu by e mail ekechko gmail com 2 starovoitov kechko rational fractions j n m z j n m z f p j n m z qn m z j 1 2 k are called type n m hermite pade approximants

called hermite s integrals the decisive role of these integrals in the proof of the transcendence of the numbers e is well known see 5 for k 1 in this case m m 1 m and n m z f 1 1 n m z are called pade approximants of function f 1 explicit expressions for the remainder function rn m z r 1 n m z f 1 and the denominator qm z f 1 were found by h van rossum 6 namely for n m 1 qm z f 1 1 f 1 m n m 1

arbitrary curve connecting the points 0 and j henceforth for complex numbers w and we assume that w e lnw with a single valued branch of the logarithm defined by the equality lnw ln w i arg 0 w arg 0

conditions of n mj 1 see 8 further for 6 1 we assume their fulfillment lobachevskii journal of mathematics asymptotics for hermite pade approximants 3 and j 1 2 k or as n m respectively the problem of describing the rate of this convergence is of current interest 8 10 18 in 11 the rate of convergence of pade approximants n m z f 1 was established for n m 1 and n m f 1 z n m z f 1 1 m m n e 2 mz n m

pade approximants pertain mainly to the diagonal case and are obtained under the condition that the numbers j kj 1 are real and 1 essentially the only method in such studies is the saddle point method for complex numbers j kj 1 and in the nondiagonal case the use of the saddle point method is extremely difficult in such a situation in 8 a new method that is based on the taylor theorem and heuristic considerations underlying the laplace and saddle point methods was applied in this article we prove a multidimensional analogue of theorem 4 from 8 in which the case k 2 was considered when proving we use the methods of this paper and the analogue of van rossum s identity established by us besides under certain conditions on m and the main restriction limn m n n 0 of theorem 4 can be removed also we note the paper by h stahl 3 in which for k 2 1 1 2 1 the rate of convergence of rescaled diagonal hermite pade approximants was established using the method of the matrix riemann hilbert problem with the rescaling of variable z n the zeros and poles of such rational approximants fill some curves in the complex plane c today the questions related to the description of these curves and the asymptotics of the rescaled approximants attract considerable interest of specialists see for example 12 14 2 main result m o n j kj 1 c theorem 1 let n z 1 m m 1 mk zk j kj 1 be different nonzero

j j m if k 1 before proceeding to the proof of theorem 1 we note that under the assumptions made in it from 4 it follows that qn m z 1 o 1 for n m therefore it is sufficient to find the asymptotics of the functions rj n m first we prove an analogue of the van rossum identity 2 for k 1 theorem 2 for any k 1 and j 1 2 k r j n m z f 1 m n mj 1 j j k n zn m 1 n m m mj l 0 al mj l n mj l 1 1 f 1 mj l 1

assume that k 1 in the integral 3 which defines the remainder function we change the variable x jt and obtain r j n m z n mj 1 j zn m 1 n m 1 0 tn 1 t 1 mj k 1 6 j jt m e j 1 t zdt 9 the integral in 9 we denote by ij z in this integral we substitute u 1 t and then factor out j k then ij z 1 m j k 1 0 1 u n 1 umj k 1 6 j 1 j u j m e juzdu 10 denote the integral in 10 by jj z applying the binomial

in c as n therefore for sufficiently large lobachevskii journal of mathematics asymptotics for hermite pade approximants 5 n the absolute value of the second term of sum in the braces in the previous

difference being that in 8 instead of j j should take j j when proving the last inequality we used the fact that function t mj t n mj 1 t is monotonically increasing for t 1 and the well known equality z 1 z z now applying the identity 11 one more time with j j replaced by j j we obtain m mj l 0 a l m n m 1 l k 1 6 j 1 j j m n m 1 m it remains to note that since limn m n 0 the right hand side of the last equality tends to 1 as n theorem 1 is proved 3 main result j kj 1 are the roots of the equation z k 1 in the statement of theorem 1 we have significant constraints on the growth of the multi index order m o n as n consider one particular case when these restrictions can be removed let j kj 1 be the roots of the equation z k 1 i e j e i 2 j 1 k j 1 2 k 12 where i is the imaginary unit note that for every j 1 2 k j k 1 6 j j k 2 1 1 k 1 k 13 equalities 13 can be easily proved if in the both sides of identity zk kj z j k 1 6 j z we pass to the limit as z j consider the system of functions f where j kj 1 and j are defined by the equalities 12 in 8 in the diagonal case when n m 1 mk the following asymptotic equalities were obtained using the saddle point method for k 1 and j 1

5 therefore further we assume that k 1 in this case k j 1 j 0 and from 4 it follows that qn m z 1 o 1 as n m it is necessary to find the asymptotic of the remainder function r j n m z 1 m e jz zn km 1

function and using the stirling formula we obtain that u 0 j 1 j 0 k n n km 1 o 1 as n m in particular from this it follows that for sufficiently large n m we have u 0 0 1 to determine the asymptotic behaviour of the integral ij z we expand the function exp juz in the taylor series in a neighborhood of u 0 then e juz e ju 0 ze jz u u 0 e ju 0 z 1 jz u u 0 u z where for z l and u 0 1 u z 6 j 2 u u

when proving we used the representation u u 0 2 u 2 uu 0 u 0 u u 0 and the equality j 1 u 0 j 0 0 applying the equality 18 and then expressing the euler beta functions in terms of the gamma functions

n 1 k b m 1 n k km m n n m 1 19 taking into account the equalities 13 for m 1 mk m we obtain that 1 m n mj 1 j k 1 6 j j m 1 m n 1 j k m therefore with the corresponding parameters mj and r z the theorems 1 and 3 are consistent also we note that if the condition m o n as n is not satisfied then the equivalence in 19 is broken it means that the conditionm o n in the theorem 1 is necessary
