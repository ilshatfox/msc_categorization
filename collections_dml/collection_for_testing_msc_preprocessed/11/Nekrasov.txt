power filtration on morphisms of formal group law i i nekrasov 1 submitted by a m elizarov 1 st petersburg state university chebyshev laboratory st petersburg 14 th line of v o 29 b received october 6 2017 abstract the height filtration on the stack of formal groups mfg is well known we explore analogous filtration on a set of morphisms of formal group laws which extends to the stack mfg it is correctly defined colimit object for this filtration which can be identified with the colimit mfg as a corollary we prove explicitly density of additive formal group in any group law 2010 mathematical subject classification 11 s 31 14 l 05 keywords and phrases formal group laws height filtration 1 introduction formal group laws is a powerful tool for local problems in number theory it is classically known that kernels of isogenies are the main reason for all arithmetic fenomenas concerning formal groups for instance p divisible groups were invented exactly as a generalization of the tate module kernel of isogeny of formal groups not formal groups itself also the definition of the stack mfg 1 incarnates the idea of high importance only of the isogenies among all homomorphisms of formal group laws it was shown that additive group isomorphic modulo a tate module to a subgroup of any formal group by highly abstract reasonings 1 we give absolutely direct method of constructing such groups section 2 contains preliminaries for further sections in section 3 we following j lubin develop lattice finite subgroups correspondence theory on the level of full functors in section 4 we develop power filtration on morphisms of formal group laws which in case of endomorphism ring give us an explicit subgroup isomorphic to the additive group law 2 preliminaries we fix a prime number p and a local field k which we assume to be a finite extension of the field of p adic numbers qp ring of integers and maximal ideal of the field k we denote by ok and mk respectively it is known that we can continue discrete valuation vqp from qp to k in the unique way then by a uniformizer k of maximal ideal mk we mean any element with valuation equals 1 by fgl we denote the category of all one dimensional formal group laws 2 its quotient in stack terminology by a group of all isomorphisms we get mfg we assume that all formal group laws are defined over the ring ok for any such group law f and maximal ideal ml of any extension l k we form an actual group group of points f ml with addition given by a f b f a b we refer to 3 for structural results on ring of endomorphisms of formal group law for any extension l k abelian group f ml has a natural endok f gal l k module structure also we remind that the notion of height 4 is well defined for formal group laws moreover the height induces a natural filtration not only on the category fgl but on a stack mfg fgl 1 fgl 2 fgl e mail geometr nekrasov yandex ru 2 i i nekrasov mfg 1 mfg 2 mfg by fglfin we denote a full subcategory of formal group laws of finite height it is well known that all groups of infinite height are isomorphic to the additive group law fa x y set of homomorphisms between any two formal groups homfgl f g is not empty if and only if the corresponding formal groups f and g have the same height 3 lattice subgroups correspondence for formal group laws the most complete exposition on the results in classical lattice subgroups correspondence can be found in the paper 5 of j lubin we notice that results of this section is just an incarnation of the general idea of correspondence between sets and corresponding annihilators in a context of formal group laws the only endomorphisms of any formal group law f x y over ok without inverse are of the form t f x for t n where is a prime element of an endomorphisms ring 1 endok f end f ok kernels of this endomorphisms wmf k x mk m f x 0 actually are endok f and gal l k modules union of all this kernels we denote by w f k let v f be a space of all sequences a 0 a 1 such that k f a 0 0 for some k 1 and ai p f ai 1 the tate module t f of formal group law is a subspace of v f with a 0 equals 0 first form of the following theorem which describes a correspondence between finite subgroups in f and sublattices of v f appeared in 5 we present a natural generalization of the theorem to a level of equivalence of the corresponding functors the striking difference of the statement from the original one is that sets of morphisms are expanded to a maximal one theorem 1 we define two functors l and f from the category fglfin which on formal group f equals to a category lf as a category of sublattice l of v f which is contained and contains in p homotheties of t f with morphisms induced by w f k linear maps of v f a category ff as a category of all finite subgroups of a formal group law f with morphisms induced by endomorphisms of formal group f then functors l and f are naturally equivalent natural equivalence is given on objects by taking any lattice l to values set of the first non zero coordinates of all points from l proof for any morphisms between lattices we just set corresponding morphisms on values groups of first non zero coordinate but for homomorphisms of finite subgroups we should use the expanded form of the theorem 4 from 2 i e any such homomorphism we can present as an analytic homomorphism coming from the formal group structure on f x y and then pull it to a morphism of lattices 1 here and below end f is an absolute endomorphisms ring 3 for formal group law f x y lobachevskii journal of mathematics power filtration on morphisms of formal group law 3 4 height filtration on homomorphisms in this section we consider all formal group law over algebraically closed field kalg for simplicity however for any fixed formal group law all reasonings are the same for the fraction field end f zp qp also we notice that in this section categories fgl and mfg are replaceable because we work with isogeny structures only for any fixed formal group law f x y and any natural number m we consider a category cf m which consists of formal group law g x y together with a morphism g f x y g x y with a crucial condition ker m f ker g morphisms in cf m just coincide with morphisms in a coslice category f fgl then from the theorem 1 we know that the object m f f x y f x y is initial for cf m so for instance for any g x y g from cf m there exists a map g f x y g x y such that g g m f definition 1 we define an endo analog of cf m as a subcategory 2 ef m with objects f x y f f x y f x y then a natural filtration ef 0 ef 1 ef 2 coming from the one on cf m mdefine height filtration on the ring end f now we can formulate and prove the main theorem theorem 2 the colimit ef is correctly defined and equivalent to end fa proof the derivation homomorphism c end f kalg is injective so we can define a map c 1 frac c end f end f zp qp by c 1 a a w f x w for w vl a 0 but natural inclusion into ef m sends such a into a m f x m so after an elementary calculation 3 lim m f x y m f x m f y m x y we have that all this maps can be continued by lim m m f m operation to maps into the additive group fa x y then by the very construction we see that fa x y is isomorphic to ef finally we remark that all morphisms are commute with any isomorphisms of formal group f x y so it is true not only in fgl but also in mfg the following proposition is a corollary of the proof corollary 1 the additive group fa x y is isomorphic to a dense subgroup in any formal group law f x y proof from the previous it can be seen that f x y m kalg w f kalg zp qp is isomorphic to the additive group fa x y restricted to the same set by the map lim m m f x m 2 we identify it with its projection on the second coordinate thereby identify with subcategory of end f 3 the limit is taken in adic topology lobachevskii journal of mathematics 4 i i nekrasov so powers of isogenies m f can be considered as an analytic approximation sequence for logarithm logf on the punctured set mkalg w f k alg also the last proposition is an incornation of an abstract idea that after localization in the set of all isogenies of any formal group law f x y we get a representer of f x y in the component mfg acknowledgments this work was funded by the russian science foundation grant no 16 11 10200 references 1
