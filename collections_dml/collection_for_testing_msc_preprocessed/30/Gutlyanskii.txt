quasiconformal mappings in the theory of semi linear equations v gutlyanski 1 and v ryazanov 1 submitted by a m elizarov 1 institute of applied mathematics and mechanics of national academy of sciences of ukraine dobrovol sky ul 1 sloviansk 84100 ukraine received june 13 2018 abstract we study the dirichlet problem with continuous boundary data in simply connected domains d of the complex plane for the semi linear partial differential equations whose linear part has the divergent form we prove that if a jordan domain d satisfies the so called quasihyperbolic boundary condition then the problem has regular continuous weak solutions whose first gen eralized derivatives by sobolev are integrable in the second degree we give a suitable example of a jordan domain that fails to satisfy both the well known a condition and the outer cone condition we also extend these results to some non jordan domains in terms of the prime ends by caratheodory the proofs are based on our factorization theorem established earlier this theorem allows us to represent solutions of the semi linear equations in the form of composition of solutions of the corresponding quasilinear poisson equation in the unit disk and quasiconformal mapping of d onto the unit disk generated by the measurable matrix function of coefficients in the end we give applications to relevant problems of mathematical physics in anisotropic inhomogeneous media 2010 mathematical subject classification primary 30 c 62 31 a 05 31 a 20 31 a 25 31 b 25 35 j 61 secondary 30 e 25 31 c 05 34 m 50 35 f 45 35 q

all 2 2 symmetric matrix function a z ajk z with measurable entries and deta z 1 satisfying the uniform ellipticity condition 1 k 2 a z k 2 a e in d 1 for every c where 1 k further we study the semi linear equations div a z u z f u z z d 2 with continuous functions f r r either bounded or such that f t t 0 as t simi linear equations with such f describe a number of physical phenomena in anisotropic inhomogeneous media the equations 2 are closely relevant to the so called beltrami equations let d c be a measurable function with z 1 a e the equation z z z 3 where z x i y 2 z x i y 2 z x iy x and y are partial derivatives of the function in x and y respectively is said to be a beltrami equation the equation 3 is said to be nondegenerate if 1 the homeomorphic solutions of nondegenerate beltrami s equations 3 in w 1 2 loc are called quasiconformal mappings see e g 1 2 and 27 e mail vgutlyanskii gmail com e mail vl ryazanov 1 gmail com 2 v gutlyanski v ryazanov we say that a quasiconformal mapping satisfying 3 is agreed with a m 2 2 k d if z a 22 z a 11 z 2 ia 12 z det i a z 4 where i is the unit 2 2 matrix condition 1 is now written as z k 1 k 1 a e in d 5 vice versa given a measurable function d c satisfying 5 one can invert the algebraic system 4 to obtain the matrix function a m 2 2 k d a z 1 21 2 2 im 1 2 2 im 1 2 1 2 1 2 6 by the existence theorem for 3 see e g theorem v b 3 in 1 and theorem v 1 3 in 27 any a m 2 2 k d generates a quasiconfomal mapping d d we also would like to pay attention to a strong interaction between linear and non linear elliptic systems in the plane and quasiconformal mappings the most general first order linear homogeneous elliptic system with real coefficients can be written in the form fz z fz z fz 0 with measur able coefficients and such that k 1 k 1 1 this equation is a particular case of a non linear first order system fz h z fz where h g c c is lipschitz in the second variable h z w 1 h z w 2 k 1 k 1 w 1 w 2 h z 0 0 the principal feature of the above equation is that the difference of two solutions need not solve the same equation but each solution can be represented as a composition of a quasiconformal homeomorphism and an analytic function thus quasiconformal mappings become the central tool for the study of these non linear systems a rather comprehensive treatment of the present state of the theory is given in the excellent book of astala iwaniec and martin 2 this book contains also an exhaustive bibliography on the topic in particular the following fundamental harmonic factorization theorem for the uniformly elliptic divergence equations diva z u 0 z 7 holds see 2 theorem 16 2 1 every solution u w 1 2 loc of the equation 7 can be expressed as the composition u z h f z of a quasiconformal homeomorphism f g and a suitable harmonic function h on g the main goal of this paper is to point out another application of quasiconformal mappings to the study of some semi linear partial differential equations linear part of which contains the elliptic operator in the divergence form div a z u z a fundamental role in the study of the posed problem will play theorem 4 1 in 20 that can be considered as a suitable counterpart to the mentioned above factorization theorem a function u d r is a weak solution of 2 in the class c w 1 2 loc d if and only if u u where d d is a quasiconformal mapping agreed with a and u is a weak solution in the class c w 1 2 loc d of the quasilinear poisson equation u w j w f u w w d 8 where j denotes the jacobian of the inverse quasiconformal mapping 1 d d here a weak solution to 2 is a function u c w 1 2 loc such that d a z u z z dm z d f u z z dm z 0 c w 1 20 d where m z stands for the lebesgue measure in the plane lobachevskii journal of mathematics quasiconformal mappings in the theory of semi linear equations 3 2 definitions and preliminary remarks in the paper 21 theorem 3 we have established the following statement on the existence of regular weak solutions of the dirichlet problem for a quasilinear poisson equation proposition 1 let d r be a continuous function h d r be a function in the class lp d p 1 and let f r r be a continuous function that is either bounded or with the nondecreasing function f of t such that lim t f t t 0 9 then there exist weak solutions u of the quasilinear poisson equation u z h z f u z 10 such that u c d u d more precisely u d w 2 p loc d and 10 holds a e in d moreover u w 1 qloc d for some q 2 and u is locally ho lder continuous in d if in addition is ho lder continuous then u is ho lder continuous in d if p 2 then u c 1 loc d where p 2 p in particular u c 1 loc d for all 0 1 if h l d thus the degree of regularity of the weak solutions of the dirichlet problem to 10 essentially depends on the degree of integrability of the multiplier h furthermore by an example in 21 the equation 10 can have no continuous solutions if h is only in the class l 1 d making use of fundamental results on boundary correspondence under conformal and quasiconformal mappings one can extend the above statement replacing the unit disk d by a smooth jordan s domain corollary 1 let d be a smooth c 1 jordan s domain in c d r be a continuous function h d r be a function in the class lp d p 1 and let f r r be a continuous function which is either bounded or satisfying 9 with nondecreasing f of t then there exist weak solutions u of the quasilinear poisson equation u h f u for a e d 11 such that u c d u d more precisely u d w 2 p loc d and 10 holds a e in d moreover u w 1 qloc d for some q 2 and u is locally ho lder continuous in d if in addition is ho lder continuous then u is ho lder continuous in d furthermore if p 2 then u c 1 loc d where p 2 p in particular u c 1 loc d for all 0 1 if h l d in the latter case if in addition is ho lder continuous on d with some order 0 1 then u is ho lder continuous in d with the same order proof let be a conformal mapping of d onto d by the caratheodory osgood taylor theorem is extended to a homeomorphism of d onto d see 12 and 31 see also 5 and theorem 3 3 2 in the monograph 14 then setting 1 d we see that the function d r is continuous let h j h where is the inverse mapping 1 d d and j is its jacobian j 2 by the known warschawski result see theorem 2 in 34 its derivative is extended by continuity onto d consequently j is bounded and the function h is of the same class in d as h in d let u be a solution of the dirichlet problem from proposition 1 for the equation 10 with the given and h note that 1 is also extended by continuity onto d because 0 on d by theorem 1 in 34 thus u u is the desired solution of the dirichlet problem for the equation 11 by our factorization theorem mentioned in the introduction the degree of the regularity of the weak solutions of the semi linear equation 2 will depend on the degree of integrability of the jacobian j of the quasiconformal mapping d d associated with the matrix function a see equation 8 in turn the latter depends on geometry of the domain d lobachevskii journal of mathematics 4 v gutlyanski v ryazanov remark 1 by theorem 4 7 in 3 the jacobian of a quasiconformal mapping d d is in lp d p 1 if and only if the domain d satisfies the quasihyperbolic boundary condition i e kd z z 0 a ln d z 0 d d z d b z d 12 for some constants a and b and a fixed point z 0 d where kd z z 0 is the quasihyperbolic distance between the points z and z 0 in the domain d kd z z 0 inf ds d d 13 here d d denotes the euclidean distance from a point d to the boundary ofd and the infimum is taken over all rectifiable curves joining the points z and z 0 in d in this connection recall more definitions the image of the unit disk d under a quasiconformal mapping of c onto itself is called a quasidisk and its boundary is called a quasicircle or a quasicon formal curve recall also that a jordan s curve is a continuous one to one image of the unit circle in c as known such a smooth c 1 or lipschitz curve is a quasiconformal curve and at the same time quasiconformal curves can be even locally non rectifiable as it follows from the well known van koch snowflake example see e g the point ii 8 10 in 27 the recent book 17 contains a comprehensive discussion and numerous characterizations of quasidisks see also 1 16 and 27 remark 2 quasidisks satisfy the quasihyperbolic boundary condition indeed as known the conformal mapping d d is extended to a quasiconformal mapping of c onto itself if d is a quasicircle see e g theorem ii 8 3 in 27 by one of the main bojarski results see 8 the generalized derivatives of quasiconformal mappings in the plane are locally integrable with some power q 2 note also that its jacobian j w w 2 w 2 see e g i a 9 in 1 consequently in this case j lp d for some p 1 a domain d in rn n 2 is called satisfying a condition if mes d b 0 mes b d 0 14 for some 0 and 0 0 1 see 1 1 3 in 26 recall also that a domain d in rn n 2 is said to be satisfying the outer cone condition if there is a cone that makes possible to be touched by its top to every boundary point of d from the completion of d after its suitable rotations and shifts it is clear that the outer cone condition implies a condition remark 3 note that quasidisks d satisfy a condition indeed the quasidisks are the so called qed domains by gehring martio see theorem 2 22 in 18 and the latter satisfy the condition mes d b mes b d diamd 15 for some 0 1 see lemma 2 13 in 18 and quasidisks as domains with quasihyperbolic boundary have boundaries of the lebesgue measure zero see e g theorem 2 4 in 3 thus it remains to note that by definition the completions of quasidisks d in the the extended complex plane c c are also quasidisks up to the inversion with respect to a circle in d probably the first example of a simply connected plane domain d with the quasihyperbolic boundary condition which is not a quasidisk was constructed in 7 theorem 2 however this domain satisfies a condition in the next section we construct an example of a domain d with the quasihyperbolic boundary condition but without a condition and consequently without the outer cone condition see lemma 1 3 dirichlet problem for semi linear equations by the mentioned above factorization theorem from 20 the study of semi linear equations 2 in jordan domains d is reduced by means of a suitable quasiconformal change of variables to the study of the corresponding quasilinear poisson equations 8 in the unit disk d lobachevskii journal of mathematics quasiconformal mappings in the theory of semi linear equations 5 theorem 1 let d be a jordan s domain in c satisfying the quasihyperbolic boundary condition suppose that a m 2 2 k d d r is a continuous function and f r r is a continuous function which is either bounded or with nondecreasing f of t such that lim t f t t 0 16 then there is a weak solution u d r of the equation 2 which is locally ho lder continuous in d and continuous in d with u d if in addition is ho lder continuous then u is ho lder continuous in d proof by theorem 4 1 in 20 if u is a week solution of 2 then u u where is a quasiconformal mapping of d onto the unit disk d agreed with a and u is a week solution of the equation 10 with h j where j stands for the jacobian of 1 it is also easy to see that if u is a week solution of 10 with h j then u u is a week solution of 2 it allows us to reduce the dirichlet problem for equation 2 with a continuous boundary function in the simply connected jordan domain d to the dirichlet problem for the equation 10 in the unit disk d with the continuous boundary function 1 indeed is extended to a homeomorphism of d onto d see e g theorem i 8 2 in 27 thus the function is well defined and really is continuous on the unit circle it is well known that the quasiconformal mapping is locally ho lder continuous in d see theorem 3 5 in 9 taking into account the fact that d is a jordan s domain in c satisfying the quasihyperbolic boundary condition we can show that both mappings and 1 are ho lder continuous in d and d correspondingly indeed h where is a conformal riemann mapping of d onto d and h is a quasiconformal mapping of d onto itself the mappings and 1 are ho lder continuous in d and in d correspondingly by theorem 1 and its corollary in 7 next by the reflection principle h can be extended to a quasiconformal mapping of c onto itself see e g i 8 4 in 27 and consequently h and h 1 are also ho lder continuous in d see again theorem 3 5 in 9 the ho lder continuity of and 1 in closed domains follows immediately now it is easy to see that if is ho lder continuous then is also so and all the conclusions of theorem 1 follow from proposition 1 lemma 1 there exists a jordan s domain d in c with the quasihyperbolic boundary condition that does not satisfy either condition a or the condition of the outer cone proof let c 1 be the cube z x iy x 1 y 1 rn are the rectangles z x iy 1 x an n y n 1 with an 1 n and n 2 n and r n are the reflections of rn with respect to the real axis n 1 2 let d be the domain consisting of the cube c 1 and the remainder r n 1 rn r n first of all it is clear that d is a jordan s domain whose boundary consists of a countable collection of segments of horizontal and vertical straight lines and the point z 0 1 let us show thatd satisfies the quasihyperbolic boundary condition note firstly that the quasihyper bolic distance from 0 to any point in its central closed cube c 3 4 z x iy x 34 y 3 4 is not grater than 3 now let c be the continuum consisting of the cube c 3 4 and the segments 3 4 x 7 4 on the straight lines y 3 4 and y 3 4 it is clear by the triangle inequality that the quasihyperbolic distance from 0 to any point of c is not grater than 7 next note that all points in the triangle with the vertices 7 4 3 i 4 2 i and 2 i 2 lie more closely to the vertical line x 2 than to the horizontal lines y 1 and y 1 2 because its sides 7 4 3 i 4 2 i and 7 4 3 i 4 2 i 2 are bisectrices of the right angles at vertices 2 i and 2 i 2 of d each point in lies on a segment of a straight line starting from the corresponding point on the side 2 i 2 i 2 d and ending at the point 7 4 3 i 4 c and the slope of the line to the side is varied in the limits 4 and 2 let s be the natural parameter on one of such segments s with s 0 at the corresponding point of d and s be the natural parametrization of points on then d s d s 2 17 lobachevskii journal of mathematics 6 v gutlyanski v ryazanov by the symmetry of d the similar statement is true for the triangle that is symmetric for with respect to the real axes note also that every point ind c except the points of the triangles and lies on a segment of a straight line going under the angle 4 with respect to horizontal and vertical straight lines starting from the corresponding point on d and ending at the nearest point on the continuum c it is clear that 17 holds on such segments too the lengths of all segments mentioned above are bounded by the diameter of d 13 4 and consequently kd s 0 s 2 ln s ln s 0 2 ln ln s 0 where s and s 0 correspond to points in c and in d c thus by the triangle inequality kd z 0 2 ln d 0 d d z d 7 2 ln 2 2 ln d 0 d d z d 10 z d i e the domain d really satisfies the quasihyperbolic boundary condition finally let us show that d does not satisfy a condition at the point 1 0 indeed let us consider the sequence of disks dn centered at the given point with the radii 2 n a 2 n 2 n n 2 2 2 n note thatdn d contains 2 caps of the diskdn that are cut off by the horizontal straight lines y n 2 n and y n 2 n consequently in mes dn d mesdn n sin n where n is the angular size of each of these caps since sin n 2 an n converges to 1 as n we have that n i e in converges to 1 as n scaling rotating and shifting the remainder r from the proof it is possible to construct jordan domains d that are similar to the van koch snowflake with the quasihyperbolic boundary condition and simultaneously without a condition at the everywhere dense set of boundary points 4 the dirichlet problem in terms of prime ends it is much more simpler than in lemma 1 to construct similar examples of domains with the quasihyperbolic boundary condition that are not jordan lemma 2 there exist bounded simply connected domains d in c that are not jordan satisfy the quasihyperbolic boundary condition however without a condition and consequently without the outer cone condition proof let p be the rectangular z x iy 1 x 2 y 1 and let the domain d be obtained from p through cut along 1 x 2 in the real axis denote by c the union of the cube c 1 2 z x iy x 1 2 y 1 2 and 2 segments 1 2 x 3 2 on the straight lines y 1 2 and y 1 2 let be the triangle with the vertices 3 2 i 2 2 i and 2 and let be the triangle which is symmetric for with respect to the real axis arguing as in the proof of lemma 2 it is easy to get the following estimate kd z 0 2 ln d 0 d d z d 5 z d i e the domaind is really with the quasihyperbolic boundary condition but it is clear that a condition does not hold at the end point of the cut in p before to formulate the corresponding results for non jordan domains let us recall the necessary definitions of the relevant notions and notations namely we follow caratheodory 13 under the definition of the prime ends of domains in c see also chapter 9 in 14 first of all recall that a continuous mapping i c i 0 1 is called a jordan arc in c if t 1 t 2 for t 1 t 2 we also use the notations and for i i and i i correspondingly a cross cut of a simply connected domain d c is a jordan arc in the domain d with both ends on d splitting d a sequence 1 m of cross cuts of d is called a chain in d if lobachevskii journal of mathematics quasiconformal mappings in the theory of semi linear equations 7 i i j for every i j i j 1 2 ii m splits d into 2 domains one of which contains m 1 and another one m 1 for every m 1 iii m 0 asm where m is the diameter of m with respect to the euclidean metric in c correspondingly to the definition a chain of cross cuts m generates a sequence of domains dm d such that d 1 d 2 dm and d dm m chains of cross cuts m and k are called equivalent if for every m 1 2 the domain dm contains all domains d k except a finite number and for every k 1 2 the domain d k contains all domains dm except a finite number too a prime end p of the domain d is an equivalence class of chains of cross cuts of d later on ed denote the collection of all prime ends of a domain d and dp d ed is its completion by its prime ends next we say that a sequence of points pl d is convergent to a prime end p of d if for a chain of cross cuts m in p for every m 1 2 the domain dm contains all points pl except their finite collection further we say that a sequence of prime ends pl converge to a prime end p if for a chain of cross cuts m in p for every m 1 2 the domain dm contains chains of cross cuts k in all prime ends pl except their finite collection a basis of neighborhoods of a prime end p of d can be defined in the following way let d be an arbitrary domain from a chain in p denote by d the union of d and all prime ends of d having some chains in d just all such d form a basis of open neighborhoods of the prime end p the corresponding topology on ed and respectively on dp is called the topology of prime ends the continuity of functions on ed and dp will be understood with respect to this topology or the same with respect to the above convergence theorem 2 let d be a bounded simply connected domain in c satisfying the quasihyperbolic boundary condition suppose a m 2 2 k d ed r is a continuous function and f r r is a continuous function which is either bounded or with nondecreasing f of t such that lim t f t t 0 18 then there is a weak solution u d r of the equation 2 which is locally ho lder continuous in d and continuous in dp with u ed proof by theorem 4 1 in 20 if u is a week solution of 2 then u u where is a quasiconformal map of d onto the unit disk d agreed with a and u is a week solution of the equation 10 with h j here j stands for the jacobian of the mapping 1 and vice versa if u is a week solution of 10 with h j then u u is a week solution of 2 hence the dirichlet problem for 2 in the domain d can be reduced to the so for the equation 10 in d with the corresponding boundary function 1 the existence and continuity of the boundary function in the case of an arbitrary bounded simply connected domain d is a fundamental result of the theory of the boundary behavior of conformal and quasiconformal mappings namely 1 h where stands for a quasiconformal automorphism of the unit disk d and h is a conformal mapping of d onto it is known that can be extended to a homeomorphism of d onto itself see e g theorem i 8 2 in 27 moreover by the well known caratheodory theorem on the boundary correspondence under conformal mappings see e g theorems 9 4 and 9 6 in 14 the mapping h is extended to a homeomorphism of d onto dp thus the function is well defined and really continuous on the unit circle moreover is locally ho lder continuous in d see e g theorem 3 5 in 9 thus by theorem 4 1 in 20 theorem 2 follows from proposition 1 lobachevskii journal of mathematics 8 v gutlyanski v ryazanov 5 some model equations the interest to the study of some model semi linear equations considered below is well known both from a purely theoretical point of view due to its deep relations to linear and nonlinear harmonic analysis and because of numerous applications of equations of this type in various areas of physics differential geometry logistic problems etc see e g 2 11 15 19 24 25 28 30 and the references therein in particular the mathematical modelling of reaction diffusion problems leads to the study of the corresponding dirichlet problem for the equation 2 with specified right hand side following 4 a nonlinear system can be obtained for the density u and the temperature t of the reactant upon eliminating t the system can be reduced to a scalar problem for the concentration u f u 19 where stands for a positive constant it turns out that the density of the reactant u may be zero in a closed interior region d 0 called a dead core if for instance f u uq q 0 a particularization of the results in chapter 1 of 15 shows that a dead core may only exist if and only if 0 q 1 and is large enough see also the corresponding examples of cores in 20 in connection with the above the following statement may have of independent interest theorem 3 let d be a jordan s domain in c satisfying the quasihyperbolic boundary condition suppose that a m 2 2 k d and d r is a continuous function then there exists a weak solution u d r of the semi linear equation div a z u z uq z 0 q 1 20 which is locally ho lder continuous in d continuous in d and satisfies the boundary condition u d if in addition is ho lder continuous then u is ho lder continuous in d applying corollary 1 we also arrive at the following consequence corollary 2 let d be a smooth jordan s domain in c and let d r be a continuous function then there exists a weak solution u of the quasilinear poisson equation u z u q z 0 q 1 21 which is continuous indwithu d and such thatu c 1 loc d for all 0 1 if in addition is ho lder continuous with some order 0 1 then u is also ho lder continuous ind with the same order recall also that certain mathematical models of a heated plasma lead to nonlinear equations of the type 19 indeed it is known that some of them have the form u f u with 0 and u 0 if u 0 as for instance u u q 1 u under 0 q 1 see e g 15 with the replacement of the function u u u q signu we have that u u q signu q 1 q and with the choice f u u q 2 signu we come to the equation u u q signu u corollary 3 let d be a smooth jordan s domain in c and let d r be a continuous function then there exists a weak solution u of the quasilinear poisson equation u z u z q 1 u z 0 q 1 22 which is continuous indwithu d and such thatu c 1 loc d for all 0 1 if in addition is ho lder continuous with some order 0 1 then u is also ho lder continuous ind with the same order in the combustion theory see e g 6 32 and the references therein the following model equation u z t t 1 u eu t 0 z d 23 occupies a special place here u 0 is the temperature of the medium and is a certain positive parameter we restrict ourselves by stationary solutions of the equation and its generalizations in anisotropic and inhomogeneous media although our approach makes it possible to consider the parabolic case see 20 applying theorem 1 we come to the following statement lobachevskii journal of mathematics quasiconformal mappings in the theory of semi linear equations 9 theorem 4 let d be a jordan s domain in c satisfying the quasihyperbolic boundary condition suppose that a m 2 2 k d and d r is a continuous function then there exists a weak solution u d r of the semi linear equation div a z u z e u z 0 24 which is locally ho lder continuous in d continuous in d and such that u d if in addition is ho lder continuous then u is also ho lder continuous in d by corollary 1 applied to the corresponding quasilinear poisson equation we will finish this section with the following statement corollary 4 letd be a smooth jordan s domain in c and d r be a continuous function then there is a weak solution u of the equation u z e u z 0 25 which is continuous indwithu d and such thatu c 1 loc d for all 0 1 if in addition is ho lder continuous with some order 0 1 then u is also ho lder continuous ind with the same order concluding the presentation we want to emphasize the fact that joint use of the regularity results for the quasilinear poisson equations 10 and the comprehensively developed theory of conformal and quasiconformal mappings in the plane see e g the monographs 1 10 22 23 27 29 33
