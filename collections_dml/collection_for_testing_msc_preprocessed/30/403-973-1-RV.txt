structure called a up algebra he studied a up subalgebra and a up ideal somjanta et al 5 introduced the notion of a up filter and discussed the fuzzy set theory of a up subalgebra a up ideal and a up filter jun and iampan 2 introduced the concept of an implicative up filter and investigated several properties they discussed the rela tion between a up filter and an implicative up filter conditions for a 2010 mathematical subject classification 03 g 25 06 f 35 key words and phrases up algebra implicative comparative allied up filter 3 4 jun iampan up filter to be an implicative up filter and characterizations of a im plicative up filter in this paper we introduce the notions of a comparative up filter and an allied up filter and investigate related properties we discuss relations between a up filter an implicative up filter and a comparative up filter we state conditions for a up filter to be a comparative up filter and for a comparative up filter to be an implicative up filter we show that comparative up filters and implicative up filters coincide in a meet commutative up algebra x satisfying the condition x y z x x y z y x z we consider characterizations of a comparative up filter and provide conditions for a up filter to be an x allied up filter for given x x we establish an extension property for comparative up filter 2 preliminaries an algebra x x 0 of type 2 0 is called a up algebra see 1 if it satisfies the following conditions x y z x y z x y x z 0 1 x x 0 x x 2 x x x 0 0 3 x y x x y 0 y x x y 4 we define a binary relation on a up algebra x as follows x y x x y x y 0 5 in a up algebra x the following assertions are valid see 1 x x x x 0 6 x y z x x y 0 y z 0 x z 0 7 x y x x y 0 z x z y 0 8 x y x x y 0 y z x z 0 9 x y x x y x 0 10 x y x y x x 0 x y x 11 x y x x y y 0 12 comparative and allied up filters 5 a subset f of x is called a up filter of x see 5 if it satisfies the following conditions 0 f 13 x y x x f x y f y f 14 3 comparative up filters in what follows let x denote a up algebra unless otherwise definition 1 2 a subset f of x is called an implicative up filter of x if it satisfies the conditions 13 and x y z x x y z f x y f x z f 15 definition 2 a subset f of x is called a comparative up filter of x if it satisfies the conditions 13 and x y z x x y z y f x f y f 16 example 1 consider a up algebra x 0 1 2 3 with the binary operation which is given in table 1 table 1 tabular representation of the binary operation 0 1 2 3 0 0 1 2 3 1 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0 then 0 1 2 is a comparative up filter of x theorem 1 every comparative up filter is a up filter proof let f be a comparative up filter of x and let x y x be such that x y f and x f putting z y in 16 implies that x y y y x y f it follows from 16 that y f hence f is a up filter of x the converse of theorem 1 is not true in general as seen in the following example example 2 let x 0 1 2 3 be the up algebra in example 1 then 0 is a up filter of x but it is not a comparative up filter of x since 0 1 2 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 and 0 0 but 1 0 6 jun iampan theorem 2 let f be a up filter of x then f is a comparative up filter of x if and only if the following implication is valid x y x x y x f x f 17 proof assume that f is a comparative up filter of x and let x y x be such that x y x f then 0 x y x x y x f by 2 since 0 f it follows from 16 that x f therefore 17 is valid conversely let f be a up filter of x that satisfies 17 let x y z x be such that x y z y f and x f then y z y f by 14 and so y f by 17 therefore f is a comparative up filter of x in example 1 we know that the comparative up filter 0 1 2 is not an implicative up filter since 0 1 3 0 2 2 0 1 2 and 0 1 1 0 1 2 but 0 3 3 0 1 2 we will consider conditions for a comparative up filter to be an im plicative up filter lemma 1 2 let x be a up algebra satisfying the following condition x y z x x y z y x z 18 then a nonempty subset f of x is a up filter of x if and only if the following assertion is valid x y f z x x y z z f 19 in a up algebra x consider the following condition x y x x y y y x x 20 the following example shows that a up algebra does not satisfy the condition 20 in general example 3 let x 0 1 2 3 be a set with the binary operation which is given in table 2 then x is a up algebra which does not satisfy the condition 20 since 2 3 3 1 3 1 6 2 0 2 3 2 2 definition 3 4 a up algebra x is said to be meet commutative if it satisfies the condition 20 comparative and allied up filters 7 table 2 tabular representation of the binary operation 0 1 2 3 0 0 1 2 3 1 0 0 1 1 2 0 0 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 lemma 2 2 let x be a up algebra which satisfies the condition 18 then every up filter is an implicative up filter if and only if the following assertion is valid x y x x x y x y 21 theorem 3 in a meet commutative up algebra x satisfying the condi tion 18 comparative up filters and implicative up filters coincide proof let f be a comparative up filter of x and let x y z x be such that x y z f and x y f using 1 and 18 we have x y z y x z x y x x z note that f is a up filter of x see theorem 1 and so x x z f by lemma 1 using 18 20 6 3 and 2 we have x z z x z x x z z z x z x z x z x x z z x z x x 0 x z x 0 x z x x z f it follows from 17 that x z f therefore f is an implicative up filter of x now let f be an implicative up filter of x then f is a up filter of x see 2 also x x y x y for all x y x by lemma 2 which implies from 11 that x x y x y 0 let x y x be such that x y x f since x is meet commutative we have x y x x x x y x y 0 and so x x y x f by 11 thus f is a comparative up filter of x by theorem 2 in general any implicative up filter may not be a comparative up filter as seen in the following example 8 jun iampan example 4 2 let x 0 a b c be a set with the binary operation which is given in table 3 table 3 tabular representation of the binary operation 0 a b c 0 0 a b c a 0 0 0 0 b 0 a 0 c c 0 a b 0 then x is a up algebra see 1 and it is routine to verify that 0 0 b 0 c and 0 b c are implicative up filters of x see 2 on the other hand 0 b is not a comparative up filter of x since b c a c b a c b 0 0 0 b and b 0 b but c 0 b lemma 3 2 every up filter f of x has the following assertion x y x x y x f y f 22 lemma 4 2 let x be a up algebra satisfying the condition 18 given a up filter f of x the following are equivalent 1 f is an implicative up filter of x 2 f satisfies the following condition x y x x x y f x y f 23 3 f satisfies the following condition x y z x x y z f x y x z f 24 theorem 4 let x be a up algebra satisfying the condition 18 for any implicative up filter f of x the following are equivalent 1 f is a comparative up filter of x 2 f satisfies the following condition x y x x y y f y x x f 25 proof assume that f is a comparative up filter of x and let x y x be such that x y y f note that x y x x y x x x y x 0 0 that is x y x x and so y x x y x y it follows that x y y y x x y x x y y x x y x x y y x x comparative and allied up filters 9 since x y y f and f is a up filter of x by theorem 1 we have 0 y x x y y x x y x x y y x x f 26 by lemma 3 and 2 which implies from 16 that y x x f conversely suppose that f satisfies the condition 25 let x y z x be such that x y z y f and x f then y z y f since f is a up filter note that y z y y z y z z which implies from lemma 3 that y z y z z f hence y z z f by 23 and so z y y f by 25 note that y z y z y x z y by 9 and 10 it follows from 22 then x z y f and so that z y f hence y f and therefore f is a comparative up filter of x lemma 5 2 extension property for implicative up filter let x be a up algebra satisfying the condition 18 given an implicative up filter f of x if a up filter g of x contains f then g is an implicative up filter of x theorem 5 extension property for comparative up filter in a meet commutative up algebra x satisfying the condition 18 every up filter containing a comparative up filter is a comparative up filter proof the proof is straightforward by theorem 3 and lemma 5 how ever we provide the numerical process given a comparative up filter f of x let g be a up filter of x which contains f then f is an implica tive up filter of x and so g is an implicative up filter of x by lemma 5 let x y x be such that y x x g if we put u y x x then u y x x 0 f hence by 18 and 24 we have y u x u x u y x u x f it follows from 25 that u x y y f g note that y x x y x x x x u x x x y u x y u x y y x y y using 22 we have u x y y x y y g and so x y y g therefore g is a comparative up filter of x by theorem 4 10 jun iampan definition 4 let x be a fixed element of x a subset f of x is called an allied up filter of x with respect to x briefly x allied up filter of x if it satisfies the condition 13 and y z x x y z f x y f z f 27 by an allied up filter we mean an x allied up filter of x for all x in x example 5 let x 0 1 2 3 be a set with the binary operation which is given in table 4 table 4 tabular representation of the binary operation 0 1 2 3 0 0 1 2 3 1 0 0 1 3 2 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 then 0 is a 0 allied up filter of x the set 0 1 2 is an allied up filter of x with respect to 0 1 and 2 but 0 1 2 is not a 3 allied up filter of x since 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 and 3 3 0 0 but 3 6 0 proposition 1 for any x x every x allied up filter contains x itself proof for any x x let f be an x allied up filter of x note that x 0 x x x 0 f and x 0 0 f hence x f by 27 remark 1 proposition 1 shows that there are no proper allied up filters in up algebras theorem 6 for any x x if f is a up filter of x which contains x then it is an x allied up filter of x proof let y z x be such that x y z f and x y f since f is a up filter of x it follows that y z f and y f and so that z f therefore f is an x allied up filter of x theorem 7 every 0 allied up filter is a up filter and vice versa proof let f be a 0 allied up filter of x and let x y x be such that x y f and x f then 0 x x f and 0 x y x y f it follows from 27 that y f thus f is a up filter of x conversely comparative and allied up filters 11 let f be a up filter of x assume that 0 x y f and 0 x f for all x y x then x y f and x f which imply that y f thus f is a 0 allied up filter of x theorem 8 let f be a up filter of x and let a b x be such that a b if f is an a allied up filter of x then it is a b allied up filter of x proof let a b x be such that a b and let f be an a allied up filter of x let y z x be such that b y z f and b y f since a b it follows from 9 that b y z a y z and b y a y using lemma 3 we have a y z f and a y f which imply from 27 that z f therefore f is a b allied up filter of x the converse of theorem 8 is not true in general in fact in example 5 note that 2 0 and 0 is 0 allied up filter of x but 0 is not a 2 allied up filter of x since 2 2 1 2 0 0 0 and 2 2 0 0 but 1 0 the following example shows that there exists a 6 0 x such that any up filter is not an a allied up filter example 6 in the up algebra x in example 5 0 is a up filter of x but it is not a 3 allied up filter of x since 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 and 3 3 0 0 but 3 6 0 we now provide conditions for a up filter to be an x allied up filter for given x x theorem 9 let x be a up algebra satisfying the condition 18 for a up filter f of x and given x 6 0 x the following assertions are equivalent 1 f is an x allied up filter of x 2 f satisfies the following condition y z x x y z f x y z f 28 3 f satisfies the following condition y x x x y f y f 29 proof assume that f is an x allied up filter of x let y z x be such that x y z f using 18 and 1 we have x y z x y z y z x x y z y z x y x z 0 f 12 jun iampan hence x y z f by 27 if f is a up filter of x satisfying the condi tion 28 then it is clear that f is an x allied up filter of x therefore 1 and 2 are equivalent let f be a up filter of x that satisfies the condition 29 let y z x be such that x y z f using 1 2 6 8 9 and 18 we have 0 x y z x y z x y z y z x x y z x x x y z y z x x y z x y z x x x y z y z x y x z x y z x x x y z 0 x y z x x x y z x y z x x x y z which implies that x y z x x x y z 0 f since x y z f and f is a up filter of x it follows from 14 that x x x y z f hence x y z f by 29 this shows that 3 2 is valid suppose that a up filter f of x satisfies the condition 28 putting y x and z y in 28 induces 29 by 6 and 2 this completes the proof conclusion we have introduced the notions of a comparative up filter and an allied up filter and have investigated related properties we have discussed relations between a up filter an implicative up filter and a comparative up filter we have stated conditions for a up filter to be a comparative up filter and for a comparative up filter to be an implicative up filter we have shown that comparative up filters and implicative up filters coincide in a meet commutative up algebra x satisfying the condition x y z x x y z y x z we have considered characterizations of a comparative up filter and have provided conditions for a up filter to be an x allied up filter for given x x we have established an extension property for comparative up filter in further study we will apply this notion results to other type of up filters also we will study the fuzzy and soft set theory of comparative up filters and allied up filters comparative and allied up filters 13 references 1 a iampan j algebra relat top 5 1 35 54 2017 2 y b jun and a iampan
