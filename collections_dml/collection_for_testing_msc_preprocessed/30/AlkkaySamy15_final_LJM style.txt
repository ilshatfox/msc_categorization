january 13 2020 abstract in this paper we first consider another version of the rogosinski inequality for analytic functions f z n 0 anz n in the unit disk z 1 in which we replace the coefficients an n 0 1 n of the power series by the derivatives f n z n n 0 1 n secondly obtain improved versions of the classical bohr s inequality and bohr s inequality for the harmonic mappings of the form f h g

and a denote the space of analytic functions in d with the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets define b f a f z 1 in d then the bohr radius is the largest number r 0 such that if f b has the power series expansion f z n 0 anz n then n 0 an z n 1 for z r which is called the classical bohr inequality for the family b rogosinski radius is the largest number r 0 such that under the previous assumptions sn z 1 for z r where sn z n n 0 anz n n 0 denote the partial sums of f this inequality is called the classical rogosinski inequality for the family b if b and r denote the bohr radius and the rogosinski radius respectively then because sn z n n 0 an z n n 0 an z n it is clear that b r in fact the following two classical results are well known theorem a suppose that f b then we have b 1 3 and see rogosinski 25 and also 21 27 r 1 2 e mail s alkhaleefah gmail com e mail ikayumov gmail com e mail samy iitm ac in 2 seraj a alkhaleefah et al there is a long history about the consequences of bohr s inequality in particular indeed bohr 14 discovered that b 1 6 and the fact that b 1 3 was obtained independently by m riesz i schur and n weiner extensions and modifications of bohr s result can be found from 11 14 23 24 and the recent articles 1 3 9 15 19 22 we refer to 5 6 8 13 for the extension of the bohr inequality to several complex variables more recently kayumov and ponnusamy 18 introduced and investigated bohr rogosinski s radii for the family b and they discussed bohr rogosinski s radius for the class of subordinations in 7 aizenberg et al generalized the rogosinski radius for holomorphic mappings of the open unit polydisk into an arbitrary convex domain in 17 kayumov et al investigated bohr s radius for complex valued harmonic mappings that are locally univalent in d several improved versions of bohr s inequality were given by kayumov and ponnusamy in 18 and these were subsequently followed by evdoridis et al 15 to obtain improved versions of bohr s inequality for the class of harmonic mappings in 16 kayumov and ponnusamy discussed bohr s radius for the class of analytic functions g when g is subordinate to a member of the class of odd univalent functions for more information about bohr s inequality and further related works we refer the reader to the recent survey article 4 and the references therein in this paper we shall introduce and investigate another version of the rogosinski inequality for analytic functions defined on the unit disk d by substituting the derivatives of the analytic function instead of the coefficients of its power series we shall also introduce and study several new versions of the classical bohr s inequality 2 an improved version of the classical rogosinski inequality what could happened to the partial sums of the analytic function in the unit disk if we replaced the coefficients a 0 a 1 an 1 by the functions f z f z f n 1 z in this section we give an answer in the following form theorem 1 suppose that f b and f z n 0 anz n then n k 0 f k z k zk n k 0 1 2 k 2 for all z r 1 2 proof to prove this theorem we will use a modification of landau s method see 20 and 21 p 26 we consider the function g d d defined by g f 1 where 1 2 and use the substitution d 1 in view of the cauchy integral formula integration along a circle around the origin lying in its neighborhood we have f k k 1 2 i d f k 1 d 1 2 i k g k 1 d and thus we can write n k 0 f k k k 1 2 i g n k 0 1 k 1 d 1 2 i g n 1 n k 0 k d 1 set 1 2 3 1 1 k 2 kn 2 o zn 1 where we write k 1 1 2 k 0 1 2 k k and kn n k 0 1 2 k k lobachevskii journal of mathematics bohr rogosinski inequalities 3 in view of the above observations 1 reduces to n k 0 f k k k 1 2 i g n 1 kn 2 d 2 and therefore with ei and g 1 for all 1 2 and 1 we have n k 0 f k k k 12 2 0 1 n 1 kn 2 d 1 n n k 0 1 2 k 2 2 k allowing 1 we get n k 0 f k k k n k 0 1 2 k 2 for all 1 2 which completes the proof of the theorem 3 improved versions of the classical bohr s inequality for f b and f z n 0 anz n the following inequalities due to schwarz pick will be used frequently for z r 1 f z r a 1 ar and f z 1 f z 2 1 z 2 3 where a 0 a 0 1 also it is well known that the taylor coefficients of f b satisfy the inequali ties ak 1 a 2 for any k 1 4 more generally we have 26 the sharp estimate f k z k 1 f z 2 1 z k 1 z for any k 1 and z d 5 which in particular gives second inequality in 3 and 4 by setting z 0 in 5 in the following we also assume that m n and the idea of replacing ak by f k z k is used in 22 but our concern here is slightly different from theirs theorem 2 suppose that f b and f z n 0 anz n then af z f zm zm f zm k 2 ak rk 1 for all r rm 1 6 where rm 1 is the maximal positive root of the equation m x 0 with m x 1 x x 2 m

simple fact will be used in the later theorems also using this inequality and 4 we easily obtain from 3 and 6 that af z f zm rm 1 r 2 m 1 f zm 2 1 a 2 r 2 1 r rm a 1 arm rm 1 r 2 m 1 rm a 1 arm 2 1 a 2 r 2 1 r 1 1 a 1 rm 1 arm 1 a 2 rm 1 arm 2 1 a 2 r 2 1 r 1 1 a m a r 1 arm 2 1 r where m a r 1 rm 1 arm 1 r 1 a rm 1 r r 2 1 a 1 arm 2 1 r ar 2 m 2 rm 1 r 2 1 a 1 arm 2 the second inequality above is justified because of the fact that r m 1 r 2 m 1 2 for r m 2 1 also rm 1 m 2 1 where rm 1 is as in the statement now since m a r is an increasing function of a in 0 1 it follows that m a r m 1 r 1 r r 2 m 2 rm 1 2 r 2 1 rm 2 m r where m r is given by 7 clearly af z 1 if m r 0 which holds for r rm 1 to show the sharpness of the radius rm 1 we let a 0 1 and consider the function f z a z 1 az a 1 a 2 k 1 a k 1 zk z d 8 so that f k z k 1 a 2 a k 1 1 az k 1 for k 1 and z d for this function we observe that for z r and a 0 1 f zm zm f zm k 2 ak rk a 2 rm ar 2 m 1 arm 2 1 a 2 ar 2 1 ar 1 1 a pm a r 1 arm 2 1 ar 9 lobachevskii journal of mathematics bohr rogosinski inequalities 5 where pm a r 1 ar ar 2 m 2 rm 1 ar 2 1 a 1 arm 2 and the last expression 9 is larger than 1 if and only if pm a r 0 by a simple calculation we find that pm a r a r 2 m 2 a r 2 r 2 m 1 r 1 r 2 rm 3 a 2 r 2 m 2 4 arm 2 2 ar 2 4 a 3 r 2 m 2 6 a 2 rm 2 which is clearly non negative for each r 0 1 and thus for each r 0 1 pm a r is an increasing function of a this fact gives 0 r 2 m r 1 r 2 rm pm 0 r pm a r pm 1 r m r where m r is given by 7 therefore the right hand side of 9 is smaller than or equal to 1 for all a 0 1 only in the case r rm 1 finally it also suggests that the right hand side of 9 is larger than 1 if r rm 1 this completes the proof remark 1 in tables 1 and 2 we listed the values of rm 1 and rm 2 for certain values of m if we allow m in theorem 2 resp theorem 3 below we note that rm 1 1 2 resp rm 2 1 2 below and thus if f b then we have the inequality f 0 k 2 f k 0 k rk 1 for all r 1 2 and the number 1 2 is sharp theorem 3 if f b then bf z f zm k 2 f k zm k rk 1 for all r rm 2 10 where rm 2 is the minimum positive root of the equation m x 0 with m x 2 x 2 1 x 2 m 1 xm x 11 and the constant

mathematics 6 seraj a alkhaleefah et al proof as before we let f b and a a 0 by assumption 3 and 5 with zm in place of z we have bf z f zm 1 f zm 2 1 rm k 2 r 1 rm k f zm r 2 1 r 2 m 1 rm r 1 f zm 2 rm a 1 arm r 2 1 r 2 m 1 rm r 1 rm a 1 arm 2 1 1 a 1 rm 1 arm r 2 1 a 2 1 arm 2 1 rm r 1 1 a m a r 1 arm 2 1 rm r where m a r 1 rm 1 arm 1 rm r r 2 1 a the second inequality above is a consequence of our earlier observation used in theorem 2 but this time with r 2 1 r 2 m 1 rm r it is a simple exercise to see that m a r for each m 1 is an increasing function of a in 0 1 and thus it follows that m a r m 1 r m r where m r is given by 11 clearly m a r 0 if m r 0 which holds for r rm 2 where rm 2 is the minimum positive root of the equation m r 0 thus bf z 1 for r rm 2 and the inequality 10 follows to show the sharpness of the radius rm 2 we let a 0 1 and consider the function g z f z where f is given by 8 then for g we easily have g k z k 1 a 2 ak 1 1 az k 1 z d now we choose a as close to 1 as we please and set z r m a by a simple calculation the corresponding bg z takes the form bg z a rm 1 arm ar 2 1 a 2 1 arm 2 1 arm ar 1 1 a 1 rm 1 arm ar 2 1 a 2 1 arm 2 1 arm ar 1 1 a pm a r 1 arm 2 1 arm ar 12 where pm a r a 1 a r 2 1 rm 1 arm 1 arm ar clearly bg z 1 if and only if pm a r 0 by elementary calculations we find that pm a r a 2 a r 2 rm 1 rm rm r r 2 1 rm 2 rm r 2 a r 2 r 2 m rm 1 r 3 m r 2 m 1 2 r 2 m rm 1 2 rm r 2 r which is easily seen to be greater than or equal to 0 for any r 0 1 and m 1 consequently pm a r pm 1 r m r 2 r 2 1 r 2 m 1 rm r lobachevskii journal of mathematics bohr rogosinski inequalities 7 therefore the expression on the right of 12 is smaller than or equal to 1 for all a 0 1 only in the case when r rm 2 finally it also suggests that a 1 in the right hand side of 12 shows that the expression 12 is larger than 1 if and only if r rm 2 this completes the proof theorem 4 suppose that f b and f z n 0 anz n then cf z f zm z f zm k 2 ak rk 1 for all r rm 3 13 where rm 3 is the maximal positive root of the equation m r 0 with m r 3 x 1 xm 2 x 2 xm 2 xm 1 x 14 and the constant rm 3 cannot be improved m rm 3 1 0 280776 2 0 316912 3 0 327911 4 0 33152 5 0 332726 table 3 rm 3 is the maximal positive root of the equation 3 x 1 xm 2 x 2 xm 2 xm 1 x 0 proof as in the proofs of theorems 2 and 3 it follows from 3 4 and 5 that cf z f zm r 1 r 2 m 1 f zm 2 1 a 2 r 2 1 r rm a 1 arm r 1 r 2 m 1 rm a 1 arm 2 1 a 2 r 2 1 r 1 1 a 1 rm 1 arm 1 a 2 r 1 arm 2 1 a 2 r 2 1 r 1 1 a m a r 1 arm 2 1 r where m a r 1 rm 1 arm 1 r r 1 a 1 r r 2 1 a 1 arm 2 r 1 a arm 2 1 a 2 arm 1 rm 1 arm 1 r m 1 r m r where m a r is seen to be an increasing function of a in 0 1 and m r is given by 14 note that the second inequality above holds since max 2 r 1 r 2 m 1 and so for any r rm where rm is the maximal positive root of the equation 2 r 1 r 2 m 0 andrm 3 rm form n whererm 3 is the maximal positive root of the equation m r 0 since m r 0 for r rm 3 we obtain cf z 1 for r rm 3 and the desired inequality 13 follows lobachevskii journal of mathematics 8 seraj a alkhaleefah et al it remains to show the sharpness of the radius rm 3 to do this we let a 0 1 and consider the function f is given by 8 for this function we observe that for z r cf z rm a 1 arm r 1 a 2 1 arm 2 1 a 2 ar 2 1 ar 1 1 a qm a r 1 arm 2 1 r 15 where qm a r r 1 a a 2 rm 2 1 a 2 arm 1 rm 1 arm 1 ar we see that cf z 1 for a 0 1 if and only if qm a r 0 by a simple calculation we find that qm a r is an increasing function of a in 0 1 and therefore we have qm a r qm 1 r 2 r 2 rm 2 2 rm 1 rm 1 rm 1 r m r m r is given by 14 therefore the expression 15 is smaller than or equal to 1 for all a 0 1 only when r rm 3 finally it also suggests that a 1 in 15 shows that the expression 15 is larger than 1 if r rm 3 this completes the proof remark 2 in table 3 we listed the values of rm 3 for certain values of m if we allow m in theorem 4 we see that rm 3 13 and hence we have the classical bohr inequality for f b f 0 k 1 ak z k 1 for all r 1 3 and 1 3 is sharp 4 two improved versions of bohr s inequality for harmonic mappings theorem 5 suppose that f z h z g z n 0 anz n n 1 bnz n is a harmonic mapping of d such that g z k h z for some k 0 1 and h b then we have df z h zm n 1 an rn n 1 bn rn 1 for all r rkm 1 16 where rkm 1 is the maximal positive root of the equation m r 0 with m r 2 x 1 k 1 x m 1 x 1 xm 17 and the constant rkm 1 cannot be improved m r 1 m 1 1 0 154701 2 0 188829 3 0 197544 4 0 199494 5 0 199898 table 4 r 1 m 1 is the maximal positive root of the equation 4 x 1

with respect to r gives n 1 bn rn k n 1 an rn for all r 1 3 here q denotes the quasi subordination using these and the first inequality in 3 for h z one can obtain that for z r 1 3 df z rm a 1 arm 1 k r 1 a 2 1 ar 1 1 a 1 rm 1 arm 1 k r 1 a 2 1 ar 1 1 a m a r 1 arm 1 ar where m a r r 1 k 1 a 1 arm 1 rm 1 ar which is indeed an increasing function of a 0 1 so that m a r m 1 r m r where m r is given by 17 we see that df z 1 if m r 0 which holds for r rkm 1 where rkm 1 is the maximal positive root of the equation m r 0 this proves the inequality 16 finally to show the sharpness of the radius rkm 1 we consider the function f z h z h z h z z a 1 az 18 where 0 1 for this function we get that for z r and a 0 1 df z rm a 1 arm 1 r 1 a 2 1 ra and the last expression shows the sharpness of rkm 1 with 1 this completes the proof of the theorem remark 3 in table 4 we listed the values of rkm 1 for k 1 and for certain values of m when m we have from theorem 5 that rkm 1 2 4 k 6 thus under the hypotheses of theorem 5 we have h 0 n 1 an rn n 1 bn rn 1 for all r 2 4 k 6 lobachevskii journal of mathematics 10 seraj a alkhaleefah et al which for k 0 gives the classical bohr s inequality and for k 1 this inequality contains the bohr inequality for sense preserving harmonic mapping f z h z g z of the disk d with the bohr radius 1 5 see 17 theorem 6 assume the hypotheses of theorem 5 then we have ef z h zm zm h zm n 2 an rn n 1 bn rn 1 for all r rkm 2 where rkm 2 is the maximal positive root of the equation m r 0 with m r 1 x x 2 m 2 xm 1 2 x x k 1 xm 2 and the constant rkm 2 cannot be improved m r 1 m 2 1 0 1671 2 0 240751 3 0 267472 4 0 276691 5 0 279585 table 5 r 1 m 2 is the maximal positive root of the equation 1 x x 2 m 2 xm 1 2 x x 1 1 xm 2 0 proof as in the proofs of theorem 5 and earlier theorems we easily have ef z rm a 1 arm rm 1 r 2 m 1 rm a 1 arm 2 1 a 2 r 2 1 r k 1 a 2 r 1 r 1 1 a 1 rm 1 arm 1 a 2 rm 1 arm 2 1 a 2 r k r 1 r 1 1 a m a r 1 arm 2 1 r where m a r 1 rm 1 r 1 arm rm 1 a 1 r 1 a r r k 1 arm 2 1 r ar 2 m 2 rm 1 r 1 a r k 1 arm 2 m 1 r m r the first inequality above is justified with the same reasoning as in the proofs of earlier theorems now we see that ef z 1 whenever m r 0 which holds for r rkm 2 where r k m 2 is the maximal positive root of the equation m r 0 to show the sharpness of the radiusrkm 2 consider the function f defined by 18 with 0 1 for this function the corresponding expression for ef z with z r turned out to be ef z a 2 rm ar 2 m 1 arm 2 ar 1 a 2 r 1 ar 19 lobachevskii journal of mathematics bohr rogosinski inequalities 11 the last expression is larger than 1 if and only if p km a r 0 where p km a r 1 ar ar 2 m 2 rm 1 ar 1 a r 1 arm 2 20 by a simple calculation we find that p km a r is an increasing function of a 0 1 and for each r 0 1 so that p km a r p k m 1 r 1 r r 2 m 2 rm 1 2 r r 1 rm 2 therefore the expression 19 is smaller than or equal to 1 for all a 0 1 only in the case when r rkm 2 k finally it also suggests that a 1 in 20 shows that the expression 19 is larger than 1 if r rkm 2 this completes the proof remark 4 in table 5 we listed the values of rkm 2 for k 1 and for certain values of m if we allow m in theorem 6 we obtain that rkm 2 r k 2 1 4 2 k 1 2 8 2 k 1 whererk 2 is the positive root of the equation 2 x x k x 1 0 and the conclusion of theorem 6 takes the following form h 0 n 2 an rn n 1 bn rn 1
