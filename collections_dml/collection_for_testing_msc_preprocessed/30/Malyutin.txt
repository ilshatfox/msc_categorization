analytical functions of finite order 1 in the half plane the necessary and sufficient conditions for solvability of interpolation problem are obtained these conditions are obtained in terms of the nevanlinna product of interpolation nodes the solution of the interpolation problem is constructed in the form of the jones interpolation series which is a generalization of the lagrange interpolation series 2010 mathematical subject classification 30 e 05 keywords and phrases half plane function of finite order free interpolation nevanlinna product carleson theorem jones interpolation series 1 introduction in 1948 a f leont ev 1 first considered the interpolation problem in the space of entire functions of finite order 0 which received the name of free interpolation problem as known interpolation problem is called problem of free interpolation in the case when on the values of interpolation function f in interpolation nodes only necessary restrictions are imposed related to the fact that the function f must to belong to the considered space in this paper we consider the problem of free multiple interpolation in the spaces of analytical functions of finite order 1 in the half plane let c be the complex plane c z z 0 let r be the real axis and n be the set of positive integers we denote by c a r the open disk of radius r with centre at a let be the intersection of a set with the half plane c c denote by the space of analytical functions of finite order 1 in c 2 chapter i 1 i e f if sup z c ln ln f rei ln r lim sup r sup 0 ln ln f rei ln r 6 where ln a ln a ln a a 1

integer multi plicities qn n 1 n is called an interpolation divisor in the space if for any sequence of complex numbers bn k k 1 2 qn n n satisfying the conditions sup n n 1 ln an 2 ln ln sup 16 k 6 qn bn k an k 1 k 1 1 lim sup a n 1 ln an ln ln sup 16 k 6 qn bn k an k 1 k 1 6 2 there exists a function f solving the interpolation problem f k 1 an bn k k 1 2 qn n n 3 the conditions 1 and 2 are necessary restrictions on the sequence bn k these restrictions are related to the fact that function f z solving the interpolation problem 3 must belong to the space in 1975 b ya levin and n uen 3 considered the problem of simple interpolation i e qn 1 n n in the space 1 in the case when for any 0 the inequality an exp an holds for all n n they obtained necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for the solvability of the corresponding interpolation problems in terms of the nevanlinna product of interpolation nodes but between two types of these conditions there was a gap that did not allow the interpolation nodes to accumulate at points of the real axis this problem without these restrictions was solved in works 4 5 the problem of multiple interpolation under restrictions an exp an was considered by n uen 6 n uen also obtained necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for the solvability of the interpolation problem which are similar to the conditions in the article 3 the aim of this paper is to study the interpolation problem in the space for 1 we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the interpolation problem to be solvable this conditions are formulated in the terms of canonical product determined by the interpolation nodes according to its content the problem is a problem of free interpolation denote by bq u v the nevanlinna primary factor bq u v v

7 theorem 4 see also 2 chapter i 3 theorem 3 2 by we denote here the integer part of a number the function e z is called the canonical function of the divisor d our main result is the theorem stated below lobachevskii journal of mathematics multiple interpolation 3 theorem 1 the following two statements are equivalent 1 the divisor d is an interpolation divisor in the space 2 the condition 4 holds and the canonical function e z of the divisor d satisfies the conditions sup n n 1 ln rn 2 ln ln n 1 an qn 5 lim sup rn 1 ln rn ln ln n 1 an qn 6 6 where n k 1 k 1 d dz k 1 z an qn e z z an k 1 2 qn n n 7 in addition following titchmarsh 8 we shall use the following terms and notation if some argument involves a number independent of the main variables then it is called a constant to denote absolute positive constants not necessarily the same ones we use the letters m and p one can come across an assertion of the type f z mrp therefore f z 3 mr 2 p which need not cause any misunderstanding 2 preliminaries denote by an z 0 an ak 6 rn 2 ak z a k a k z ak qk en z e z an z a n a n z an qn bn z e z an z a n a n z an qn an z we need the following statements lemma 1 if the

by standard methods for estimating canonical products see e g 2 9 and we omit the proof lemma 2 if the divisor d satisfies 4 5 and 6 then sup n n ln qn ln rn 2 lim sup rn ln qn ln rn 6 10 proof if we use the fact that 2 an qn en an n 1 n 1 2 we get the assertion of the lemma from 5 6 and 8 lobachevskii journal of mathematics 4 malyutin kabanko lemma 3 if the divisor d satisfies 4 5 and 6 then sup

and the elementary inequality x 6 ln 1 x 0 6 x 1 we get the next relations sup n n 1 ln rn 2 ln 0 an ak 6 rn 2 qk ak an an a k 2 lim sup rn 1 ln rn ln 0 an ak 6 rn 2 qk ak an an a k 2 6 12 the condition 4 implies that for any 0 the series n 1 qn an r 1 n 13 converges from 12 and 13 we obtain the statement of the lemma lemma 4 if the divisor d satisfies 4 5 and 6 then sup n n 1 ln an 2 ln ln max 1 k qn n k aqn k 1 n 6 lim sup a n 1 ln an ln ln max 1 k qn n k an qn k 1 6 14 proof let s fix 0 from 10 and 11 it follows that there exists p 0 such that an akan a k exp r p n qn k n and an akan a k exp r n qn 15 for all rn r 0 r 0 next let ln mink n an ak it follows from 15 that ln an exp r p n qn n n and ln an exp r n qn 16 if rn r 0 we define an analytic function t on the disk c 0 1 by the equality tn t e an lnt it follows from 5 6 and 16 that for some p 1 0 0 e qn an qn lqnn exp r p 1 n n n and 0 exp r n lobachevskii journal of mathematics multiple interpolation 5 for all rn r 0 r 0 moreover t 6 max z an 6 ln e z 6 exp rp 2 n n n and t 6 exp r n for some p 2 0 and for all rn r 0 r 0 let g t t 0 since g t does not have roots in the disk c 0 1 2 and g 0 1 we can apply the carathe odory inequality see 9 chapter i theorem 9 which gives for some p 3 0 if t 6 1 4 then g t exp rp 3 n n n and g t exp r n for all rn r 0 r 0 from this for 6 ln 4 ln 8 for some p 4 0 e an ln qn exp rp 4

chapter i 1 theorem 3 2 theorem 2 govorov any function f 1 is represented as f z ei 0 1 z qz q zn 61 b 0 z zn zn 1 bq z zn exp 1 i tz 1 q 1 t 2 1 q 1 t z ln f t dt d t 18 where 0 1 q are real constants zn ne n are roots of f z all infinite products and integrals in 18 converge absolutely for any 0 the conditions hold n 61 n sin n n 1 sin n n ln f t dt d t 1 t 1 we need the following lemma lemma 5 let wn and rn be two sequences of positive numbers satisfying the conditions lim sup n rn sup n ln ln wn ln rn lim sup rn ln ln wn ln rn then the sequence n lim n n 0 of positive numbers can be chosen so that ln wn 6 r nn r k k 6 r n n if rk rn and for some sequence of values rnk k 1 2 tending to infinity ln wnk r nk nk this lemma is a consequence of the theorem on the existence of a proximate order of an entire function 9 chapter i theorem 16 lobachevskii journal of mathematics 6 malyutin kabanko 3 the proof of implication 1 2 of theorem 1 let the divisor d be interpolation divisor in the space there exists a function f such that f k 1 a 1 1 k 1 q 1 and f k 1 an 0 if n 2 k 1 qn therefore the divisor d a 1 q 1 belongs to the set of zeros of f and satisfies condition 4 2 chapter i 3 it means that and the divisor d also satisfies 4 we prove implication 1 5 and 6 by contradiction we now prove 5 assume the contrary that there exists a subsequence cn an such that lim n ln cn 2 1 ln ln cn pn n 1 19 where pn are the multiplicities of the numbers cn in d using the carleson interpolation theorem in the space h 11 and passing if necessary to a subsequence we can also assume that the set cn is sparse enough that inf n cn b cn 0 n 1 2 20 where b z n 1 c n z cn cn z c n is blaschke product corresponding to cn suppose further that f is such that f k 1 an 0 an cn k 1 qn f k 1 cn 0 k 1 pn 1 f pn 1 cn pn 1 cn 1 pn by theorem 2 the function f z f z b z e z belongs to we have f cn pn 1 1 f pn 1 n 1 b cn cn pn n 1 cnb cn the last equality with 20 and f contradicts 19 the inequality 5 is proved the inequality 6 is proved similarly 4 the proof of implication 2 1 of theorem 1 we remark that if an 6 1 then the multiplicities qn are bounded by virtue of conditions 10 therefore there exists a bounded function g h solving the interpolation problem 3 12 let b n k bn k g k 1 an for rn 1 and b n k bn k for rn 6 1 n 1 2 k 1 qn it is clear that the numbers b n k satisfy
