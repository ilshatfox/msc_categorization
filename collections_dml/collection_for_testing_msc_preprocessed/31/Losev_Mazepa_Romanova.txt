introduction this paper is devoted to the development of the fourier method in the theory of di erential equations on riemannian manifolds the theory of elliptic equations on noncompact riemannian manifolds has been quite actively developed over the past decades the following problems are most popular in this area of mathematics 1 find conditions guaranteeing that every solution of the equation from a given class is trivial liouville type thiorems 2 find the conditions providing unique solvability of boundary value problems most of the research is devoted to liouville type theorems an overview of the current state of research on this issue can be obtained for example from the work 1 in the theory of boundary value problems on noncompact riemannian manifolds most of the research is devoted to the solvability of the dirichlet problems notice that the common statement of the dirichlet problem on such manifolds could turn out nontrivial 2 however in some cases the geometric compacti cation of a manifold allows this to be done in a classical formulation one of the classes of riemannian manifolds on which the statement of the dirichlet problem has natural geometric interpretation is manifolds with negative sectional curvature see for example 3 another class of manifolds admitting traditional statement of the dirichlet problem is the manifold of the next form called model manifolds will describe their structure mg b d where b is some precompact with the non empty interior and d is isometric to the direct product r 0 s r 0 0 and s compact riemannian

positive smooth function on r 0 and d 2 be riemannian metric on s examples of such manifolds are euclidean space rn hyperbolic space hn surfaces of revolution and others we introduce the following notation j r 0 dt gn 1 t t r 0 gn 3 z dz where r 0 const 0 and n dimm the exact conditions for the ful llment of liouville type theorems and the solvability of boundary value problems for linear homogeneous and inhomogeneous equations on model riemannian manifolds were found in 5 10 in particular the following statement is proved theorem a 6 9 let the manifold mg such that j then for any functions c s and c s there exists a unique harmonic function on d such that u r 0 and lim r u r note that the boundary condition at in nity in the above statement is understood as follows lim r u r c drb r 0 a number of studies have been devoted to the study of the asymptotic behavior of derivatives of harmonic functions 11 p 232 in this regard the natural problem is the convergence of harmonic functions to boundary conditions in the norm of di erentiable functions in this paper we will consider a similar problem with the boundary condition at in nity of the following form lim r u r c 1 drb r 0 note that in the study of solutions of elliptic equations on model manifolds the fourier method of separation of variables was actively used the latter is related to their topological structure an important role was played by estimates of the eigenfunctions of the laplace operator on compact riemannian manifolds in the c norm however this task in itself is of considerable interest a number of studies were devoted to obtaining exact estimates of the c norms of the eigenfunctions of the laplace operator on compact riemannian manifolds see for example 12 13 14 in this paper we give estimates of the eigenfunctions of laplace operators on compact manifolds in the cm norm next using the fourier method the conditions for the unique solvability of the dirichlet problem for harmonic functions are found provided that the solution converges to the boundary data in the c 1 norm 2 eigenfunctions and eigenvalues let l div is an operator de ned on s here is positive smooth on s function in the case of 1 the operator l coincides with the laplace beltrami operator on s we assume that dims n this section is devoted to estimating the norms of the eigenfunctions of the operator l on compact
