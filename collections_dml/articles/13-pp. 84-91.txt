 LAGRANGEAN DUAL PROBLEMS OF VARIATIONAL INEQUALITIES 1  I.V. Konnov Kazan State University  We consider properties of Lagrangean dual problems of variational inequalities with nonlinear constraints. In general, this problem is also a variational inequality. At the same time, we show that such a dual can be formulated as a concave maximization problem.  1 Introduction  Let Q be a convex and closed subset of a real n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn, G : Rn → Rn a continuous mapping and hi : Q → R, i = 1, . . . ,m be convex continuous functions. Then one can define the variational inequality problem (VI) as follows: Find a point u∗ ∈ U such that  〈G(u∗), u− u∗〉 ≥ 0 ∀u ∈ U, (1.1) where  U = {u ∈ Q | hi(u) ≤ 0 i = 1, . . . ,m}. (1.2) It is well known that in the case where G is the gradient map of a convex function f , VI (1.1), (1.2) is equivalent to the problem of minimizing f over U , or briefly,  min u∈U → f(u). (1.3)  One of the most powerful and popular approaches to solving nonlinearly constrained optimization problems consists in exploiting duality relationships. In fact, consider the following constraint qualification (C) Either hi, i = 1, . . . ,m are affine, or there exists a point ū ∈ Q such that hi(ū) < 0 for all i = 1, . . . ,m.  Then we can state the following Kuhn-Tucker saddle point theorem (e. g. see [1, 2]).  1This work is supported in part by RFBR Project No. 01-01-0068 and by the  Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Tatarstan  84    I.V. Konnov  Proposition 1.1. (i) If u∗ is a solution to problem (1.3), (1.2) and (C) holds, then there exists an element v∗ ∈ Rm+ such that w∗ = (u∗, v∗) is a saddle point of the Lagrange function  L(u, v) = f(u) + 〈v, h(u)〉, (1.4)  i. e.,  L(u∗, v) ≤ L(u∗, v∗) ≤ L(u, v∗) ∀u ∈ Q, ∀v ∈ Rm+ , (1.5)  where h(u) = (h1(u), . . . , hm(u)). (ii) If w∗ = (u∗, v∗) is a saddle point of the Lagrange function L  defined in (1.4), then u∗ solves problem (1.3), (1.2).  We also recall that the initial (or primal) problem is equivalent to  min u∈Q → sup  v∈Rm +  L(u, v),  whereas the dual problem can be formulated as follows  max v∈Rm  +  → ψ(v), where ψ(v) = inf u∈Q  L(u, v). (1.6)  Note that the dual problem (1.6) is also an optimization problem, more precisely, it is a concave maximization problem. Thus, the initial problem (1.3), (1.2) can be in principle reduced to the simply constrained problem (1.6) which in fact is a composition of such problems. A great number of works were devoted to this approach in optimization; see e. g. [1] - [3].  It is natural to extend this approach to variational inequality problems. Clearly, we can also use the corresponding version of the Kuhn-Tucker theorem as a basis. We now recall one of such results from [4, Proposition 1].  Proposition 1.2. (i) If u∗ is a solution to VI (1.1), (1.2) and (C) holds, then there exists a point v∗ ∈ Rm+ such that  〈G(u∗), u− u∗〉+ 〈v, h(u)− h(u∗)〉 ≥ 0 ∀u ∈ Q, (1.7) 〈−h(u∗), v − v∗〉 ≥ 0 ∀v ∈ Rm+ . (1.8)  (ii) If w∗ = (u∗, v∗) solves VI (1.7), (1.8), then u∗ solves VI (1.1), (1.2).  85    A note on lagrangean dual problems. . .  Note that VI (1.7), (1.8) coincides with the saddle point problem (1.5) if G = ∇f where f is a convex function. By analogy with the previous case, we can replace VI (1.1), (1.2) with the dual problem, which can be formulated as follows: find v∗ ∈ Rm+ such that  sup t∗∈T (v∗)  〈t∗, v − v∗〉 ≥ 0 ∀v ∈ Rm+ , (1.9)  where  T (v) = {t ∈ Rm | t = −h(ũ), ũ ∈ Q(v)}, (1.10) Q(v) = {ũ ∈ Q | 〈G(ũ), u− ũ〉  +〈v, h(u)− h(ũ)〉 ≥ 0 ∀u ∈ Q}. (1.11)  Of course, both mappings Q and T , defined in (1.10), (1.11), are in general multivalued. Moreover, although T is monotone if G is so, T need not be the subdifferential map of a convex function as the following example illustrates. For simplicity, consider the problem of finding an element u∗ ∈ Ũ such that  〈Mu∗ + q, u− u∗〉 ≥ 0 ∀u ∈ Ũ ,  where Ũ = {u ∈ Rn | Au = b},  M is an n× n nonsymmetric positive definite matrix, A is an m× n matrix, q ∈ Rn, b ∈ Rm. Then Q(v) can be determined explicitly as follows:  Q(v) = −M−1(q +AT v), hence T (v) = AM−1(q+AT v), and the Jacobian of T is asymmetric in general. Therefore, VI (1.9) does not coincide with the problem (1.6).  In this work, we show that it is possible to reduce monotone VIs to dual convex maximization problems under certain additional assumptions. This approach is described in the next section.  2 Problems with a single constraint  For simplicity, we consider the strictly monotone case.  86    I.V. Konnov  Proposition 2.1. Suppose G is strictly monotone. Then the mapping Q and T , defined in (1.11), (1.10), are single-valued, and T is monotone.  The proof follows e. g. from [4, Corollary 1]. Let X be a subset in Rm and let S : X → Rm be a mapping.  The mapping S is said to be locally bounded, if it maps each bounded set into a bounded set. Next, the mapping S is said to be cyclically monotone, if for arbitrary points x0, x1, . . . , xN in X one has  〈S(x0), x1 − x0〉+ 〈S(x1), x2 − x1〉+ . . .+ 〈S(xN ), x0 − xN 〉 ≤ 0;  see [5, p. 96]. Clearly, each cyclically monotone mapping is monotone, and the reverse assertion is not true in general. However, this is the case if m = 1.  Proposition 2.2. If a mapping S : R → R is monotone, it is cyclically monotone.  Proof. We prove this assertion by induction on N . If N = 1 it is clearly true. Suppose it is true for N − 1 and choose arbitrary points x0, x1, . . . , xN . Renumbering the points if necessary, we can suppose that xN ≥ xi for all i < N . Then, by induction,  S(x0)(x1 − x0) + . . .+ S(xN )(x0 − xN ) = S(x0)(x1 − x0) + . . .+ S(xN−1)(x0 − xN−1) +S(xN−1)(xN − x0) + S(xN )(x0 − xN ) ≤ S(xN−1)(xN − x0) + S(xN )(x0 − xN ).  However, xN − x0 = τ(xN − xN−1) with τ ≥ 0, hence  S(xN−1)(xN − x0) + S(xN )(x0 − xN ) = τ [S(xN−1)− S(xN )](xN − xN−1) ≤ 0.  Thus, S is cyclically monotone.  Proposition 2.3. Suppose G is strictly monotone, Q is locally bounded and has nonempty values on Rm+ . Then Q is continuous.  87    A note on lagrangean dual problems. . .  Proof. Choose an arbitrary sequence {vk} → v′ such that vk ∈ Rm+ . Then v  ′ ∈ Rm+ and the sequence {uk} with uk = Q(vk) is bounded. Hence there exists a subsequence {uks} → u′. Clearly, u′ ∈ Q. Next, by definition, for every u ∈ Q, we have  〈G(uks), u− uks〉+ 〈vks , h(u)− h(uks)〉 ≥ 0.  Taking the limit ks →∞ in this inequality gives u′ = Q(v′). It follows that limk→∞Q(v  k) = Q(v′), i. e. Q is continuous, as desired.  Combining Propositions 2.1 - 2.3, we obtain the following key property of the mapping T .  Theorem 2.1. Suppose that m = 1, G is strictly monotone, Q is locally bounded and has nonempty values for each v ∈ Rm+ . Then T is continuous and cyclically monotone.  Proof. From Propositions 2.1 and 2.2 it follows that T is cyclically monotone. Next, from Proposition 2.3 it follows that Q is continuous. Since h is continuous, so is T . The proof is complete.  Thus, under the conditions of Theorem 2.1, the dual problem (1.9) is one-dimensional and there exists a concave function ψ such that ∇ψ(v) = −T (v) for every v ∈ Rm+ ; see e. g. [5, Theorem 7C].  Thus, the problem is to re-define U as a single-constrained set if m > 1. The simplest way is to introduce the nonsmooth auxiliary function.  H(u) = max{h1(u), . . . , hm(u)}. Then,  U = {u ∈ Q | H(u) ≤ 0}. Setting h1 = H in Proposition 1.1 and Theorem 2.1, we see that their assertion remain valid since the function H remains convex and continuous, though it is not necessary differentiable if hi, i = 1, . . . ,m are so. In addition, condition (C) implies that H(ū) < 0 for some ū ∈ Q, i. e. the constraint qualification also holds. Therefore, under the assumptions of Theorem 2.1 with the exception of m = 1, the dual problem to VI (1.1), (1.2) can be also formulated as a cancave maximization problem.  88    I.V. Konnov  3 Applications and extensions  The Lagrangean dual approach to solving VI of form (1.1), (1.2) seems very useful in the case where m = 1 and Q is defined on a product of spaces. In fact, set  Q =  s∏  j=1  Qj , Qj ⊆ Rnj ;G(u) = s∏  j=1  Gj(uj), Gj : R nj → Rnj ,  j = 1, . . . , s;  u = (uj)j=1,...,s, uj ∈ Rnj , j = 1, . . . , s; s∑  j=1  nj = n;  and  h1(u) =  s∑  j=1  h1j(uj).  Such decomposable optimization problems were studied by many researches; e. g. see [6]. In order to find an element ũ ∈ Q(v) for a given v ∈ R+, one has to solve the following VI:  n∑  j=1  〈Gj(ũj), uj − ũj〉+ s∑  j=1  v[h1j(uj)− h1j(ũj)] ≥ 0 ∀uj ∈ Qj ,  j = 1, . . . , s.  Clearly, this problem is equivalent to the s independent VIs:  〈Gj(ũj), uj − ũj〉+ v[h1j(uj)− h1j(ũj)] ≥ 0 ∀uj ∈ Qj  for j = 1, . . . , s. To solve the upper problem (1.9), we now can apply a suitable algorithm for one-dimensional nonlinear equations, for example, the well-known bisection algorithm.  In the general case where m > 1 in (1.2), the combination of an one-dimensional algorithm applied to the upper problem (1.9) and the preliminary transformation of constraints with the help of the nonsmooth function H seems reasonable in comparison with the usual Uzawa type methods (see e. g. [1, 2, 4]), especially in the case where the cost mapping G need not be strongly monotone.  89    A note on lagrangean dual problems. . .  The approach above can be applied to non strictly monotone VI (1.1), (1.2), however, then Q and T are multivalued in general. In fact, let G be monotone. Then, using Corollary 1 from [4], we see that T is also monotone. Since Proposition 2.2 remains true for multivalued mappings, we can state the following.  Proposition 3.1. If G is monotone and m = 1, then T is cyclically monotone.  Next, if G is monotone, then Q(v) is convex and closed for each v ∈ Rm+ ; see [7, Corollary 2.1.3]. If m = 1, taking into account the continuity of h, we conclude that T (v) is also convex and closed; see [8, Proposition 2.2]. Hence, if Q is locally bounded and has nonempty values, then, following the proof of Proposition 2.3, we see that Q is closed. Therefore, T is upper semicontinuous and has nonempty values. Thus, we have proven the following assertion.  Theorem 3.1. Suppose that m = 1, G is monotone, Q is locally bounded and has nonempty values. Then T is upper semicontinuous, cyclically monotone and has nonempty, convex and compact values on v ∈ R+.  Therefore, we can make use of the same max-type function H in the same manner to obtain a one-dimensional dual problem of the general VI (1.1), (1.2). However, in the monotone case, we have to resolve additional problems caused by multivaluedness of Q. For instance, if v∗ solves (1.9), then any element of Q(v∗) need not be a solution to (1.1), (1.2).  Also the algorithms for solving problems of form (1.11) with m = 1 and h1 = H, a linearly convergent method was recently proposed in [9]. Nevertheless, this approach to find a solution of nonlinearly constrained VIs should be carefully compared with other existing approaches.  References  [1] Arrow K.J., Hurwicz L., Uzawa H.
