Lapin Kazan State University  A finite-dimensional inclusion with M -matrices and several diagonal maximal monotone operators is studied. This problem can be viewed as a mesh scheme for a free boundary problem.  The article consists of three sections. In the first one the existence of a unique solution for the problem is proved as well as the  1This work was supported by RFBR, projects 01-01-00068, 01-01-00070  91    Domain decomposition and parallel solution. . .  convergence and the rate of the convergence for a class of the iterative methods are studied.  In the second and third sections the applications of the general results to the industrial problems are considered. Parallel iterative methods are constructed on the basis of the domain decomposition and the alternative Schwarz-type methods.  A bibliographical survey is included in every section.  1 Inclusions with m-matrices  and diagonal monotone operators  A finite-dimensional problem  Au+Bγ + δ = f ; γ ∈ Cu, δ ∈ Du, (1.1)  with M -matricies A,B and diagonal maximal monotone (multivalued) operators C, D is studied. The existence and the uniqueness of a solution for this problem is proved. Convergence, as well as geometric (or, linear) rate of convergence, is proved for several classes of iterative algorithms under some additional assumptions imposed to input data. Application to a mesh scheme for a model free boundary problem is considered.  Mesh approximations of free and moving boundary problems with several unknown boundaries lead to (1.1), where A and B correspond to the mesh approximations (finite difference or finite element) of the partial differential operators while multivalued operators C and D can be responsible for the constraints and nonlinear relations between the components of a solution (u, γ, δ) of the problem.  We can cite the following partial cases of problem (1.1): (i) B = 0 and δ is the subdifferential of the indicator function (or,  normal cone) of a closed convex subset K ⊂ RN . This is well-known finite-dimensional variational inequality  u ∈ K : (Au, v − u) ≥ (f, v − u) ∀v ∈ K,  (u, v) = N∑ i=1  uivi. The mesh schemes for the obstacle and two-side ob stacle problems, dam problem after Baiocchi transformation, implicit  92    A. Lapin  mesh schemes at fixed time level for one-phase Stefan problem are the examples of this variational inequality. Schwarz alternating methods for the variational inequalities have been studied in [26], [28], [29], [30], [31], [39], [40], [51], [52], [50], [12] for linear A and in [8], [30] for nonlinear M -mapping A.  (ii) ci and di are the continuous functions for all i ∈ RN , A is the identity matrix. Now, problem (1.1) includes, for example, a mesh approximation of the classical two-phase Stefan problem at a fixed time level, when B corresponds to a mesh approximation of Laplace operator, u stands for the mesh enthalpy function while γ for the temperature. Various parallel iterative methods based on the multisplittings of the matrix pair (A,B) have been considered in [6], [7], [48], [49] for this kind of problem (1.1). In [6] the geometric convergence of a class of asynchronous iterative methods for the system of nonlinear algebraic equations has been proved.  (iii) ci and di are the continuous functions, A and B are M matrices. Problem (1.1) can correspond to an implicit in time mesh scheme for the steel continuous casting problem with nonlinear boundary flux, which is a particular case of the Stefan problem with prescribed convection. The additive and multiplicative Schwarz iterative algorithms for this problem have been investigated in [34], [35]. A mesh scheme for the general Stefan problem with prescribed convection and linear boundary conditions has the form (1.1) with multivalued maximal monotone graph γi and D = 0. The article [31] deals with the algebraic problem, including such kind of the mesh scheme.  In [31] the existence of a unique solution and the convergence of a multisplitting method has been investigated for the problem with severalM -matrices and diagonal multivalued operators. Some results on the geometrical convergence of the iterative methods for problem (1.1) can be found in [33].  1.1 Existence and uniqueness of the solution.  Comparison theorem  Let for problem (1.1) the following assumptions be fulfilled:  A,B are M -matrices, (1.2)  C,D are diagonal maximal monotone operators, (1.3)  93    Domain decomposition and parallel solution. . .  i. e., for example, Cu = diag(c1(u1), . . . , cN (uN ))). Let also there exist a subsolution (u, γ, δ), γ ∈ Cu, δ ∈ Du and a supersolution (ū, γ̄, δ̄), γ̄ ∈ Cū, δ̄ ∈ Dū of problem (1.1):  (u, γ, δ)¿ (u, γ̄, δ̄), Au+Bγ + δ ¿ f ¿ Aū+Bγ̄ + δ̄, (1.4) where uÀ 0 means the componentwise inequality.  Further we suppose that the operators C and D are bounded and dom(C) = dom(D) = RN (see [31] for the details about the modification of the unbounded operators out the ordered interval 〈u, ū〉 to transform them into the bounded ones). It means that if u∗ ∈ R is a point of multivalence for an operator ci, then  ci(ui) = c̃i(ui) + αiθi, θi ∈ H(ui − u∗), where c̃i is continuous in the point u  ∗, αi > 0 andH(.) is the maximal monotone Heaviside graph.  Theorem 1.1. ([31]) Under the assumptions (1.2) - (1.4) problem (1.1) has a solution (u, γ, δ) for any f ∈ RN .  Now, let u∗ ∈ R be a common point of the multivalence for the operators ci and di for some non-empty set of indices I(u  ∗). Then for i ∈ I(u∗) we set ci(ui) = c̃i(ui) + αiθi, di(ui) = d̃i(ui) + βiθi, θi ∈ H(ui − u∗).  We define the diagonal maximal monotone operator Φ = diag(φ1, φ2, . . . , φn):  φi(ui) = {H(ui − u∗) for i ∈ I(u∗); 0 otherwise} and the diagonal positive definite matrices P and G with the entries:  { pii = αi for i ∈ I(u∗), 1 otherwise; gii = βi for i ∈ I(u∗), 1 otherwise.  Let us suppose that {u∗1, u∗2, . . . , u∗m} are all common points of the multivalence for the operators C and D. Proceeding as before for every point u∗k, k = 1, 2, . . . ,m, we get  C = C̃ +  m∑  k=1  PkΦk; D = D̃ +  m∑  k=1  GkΦk,  94    A. Lapin  where the operators C̃, D̃, Φk, k = 1, 2, . . . ,m have no common points of the multivalence and the diagonal matrices Pk, Gk are positive definite.  Theorem 1.2. Let the assumptions (1.2) - (1.4) be fulfilled and one of the following properties holds:  (a) there exists a positive vector p > 0 such that Atp > 0 and Btp ≥ 0 or, viceversa, Atp ≥ 0 and Btp > 0  or (b) there exists a positive vector p > 0 such that Atp ≥ 0, Btp ≥ 0  and C is an either continuous monotone or strictly maximal monotone operator.  Then if (u1, γ1, δ1) and (u2, γ2, δ2) are the solutions of (1.1) with right-hand sides f1 and f2, respectively, then the inequality f 1 À f2 implies the inequalities u1 À u2, γ1 À γ2, δ1 À δ2.  Proof. Let us rewrite the problem (1.1) in the form  Au+Bγ̃ + δ̃ +  m∑  k=1  (BPk +Gk)θ k = f ;  γ̃ ∈ C̃u, δ̃ ∈ D̃u, θk ∈ Φku ∀k (1.5) and denote by θk,1 and θk,2 the corresponding components of the solutions for this problem with the right-hand sides f 1 and f2.  Let I = {1, 2, . . . , N} and the subsets of I be defined by the equalities  U− = {i ∈ I : u1i < u2i }; Γ− = {i ∈ I : γ̃1i < γ̃2i };  ∆− = {i ∈ I : δ̃1i < δ̃2i }; Θk− = {i ∈ I : θ k,1 i < θ  k,2 i }  and M = ∪mk=1Θk− ∪ U− ∪ Γ− ∪∆−. Then  u1i ≤ u2i , γ̃1i ≤ γ̃2i δ̃1i ≤ δ̃2i , θ k,1 i ≤ θ  k,2 i ∀k for i ∈M,  because the operators C̃, D̃,Φk have no common points of the multivalence, while  u1i ≥ u2i , γ̃1i ≥ γ̃2i δ̃1i ≥ δ̃2i , θ k,1 i ≥ θ  k,2 i ∀k for i ∈ I \M.  95    Domain decomposition and parallel solution. . .  Let further a vector η be defined by the equalities  ηi = {pi for i ∈M ; 0 otherwise}, (1.6)  where the vector p is defined in the theorem formulation. The following inequalities are valid:  (Atη)i ≥ (Atp)i ≥ 0, (Btη)i ≥ (Btp)i ≥ 0, i ∈M ; (1.7)  and  (Atη)i ≤ 0, (Btη)i ≤ 0, i ∈ I \M (1.8) because of the non-positiveness for the off-diagonal entries of the matrices At and Bt.  For all k = 1, 2, . . . ,m we obtain  ((BPk +Gk) tη)i ≥ (Gkη)i > 0 for i ∈M ; (1.9)  and  ((BPk +Gk) tη)i ≤ 0 for i ∈ I \M. (1.10)  First, we prove, that ∆− = ∅, Θk− = ∅ ∀k under any assumption (a) or (b) of the theorem. We argue by contradiction.  Let the vector η be defined by (1.6). Multiplying equation (1.5), written for f1 and f2, by η, we derive the following inequality:  (u1 − u2, Atη) + (γ̃1 − γ̃2, Btη) + (δ̃1 − δ̃2, η)  + m∑  k=1  (θk,1 − θk,2, (BPk +Gk)tη) = (f1 − f2, η) ≥ 0. (1.11)  Owing to (1.7) - (1.10) the left-hand side in (1.11) is non-positive. If we suppose that Θk− 6= ∅ for some k then the strong inequality (1.9) ensures the strong inequality  (θk,1 − θk,2, (BPk +Gk)tη) < 0  and the left-hand side of (1.11) becomes negative that contradicts to non-negativeness of its right-hand side. Thus, Θk− = ∅ ∀k. The same arguments prove that ∆− = ∅.  96    A. Lapin  So, M = U− ∪ Γ− and inequality (1.11) can be rewritten in the following form:  (u1 − u2, Atη) + (γ̃1 − γ̃2, Btη) ≥ (f1 − f2, η) ≥ 0. (1.12)  (a) Let Atp > 0 and Btp ≥ 0. If we suppose that U− 6= ∅, then the strong inequality (u1 − u2, Atη) < 0 holds and proceeding as before we get the contradiction to the inequality (1.12). So, U− = ∅ and M = Γ−.  Let us suppose now that Γ− 6= ∅. Then from (1.12) we get  (f1 − f2, η) ≤ (γ̃1 − γ̃2, Btη) ≤ ((γ̃1 − γ̃2)Γ− , BtΓ−Γ−ηΓ−). (1.13)  The matrix BtΓ−Γ− being a submatrix of B t is also an M -matrix.  As ηΓ− ≡ pΓ− > 0, then all coordinates of the vector BtΓ−Γ−ηΓ− are non-negative and at least one of them is positive due to the regularity of the matrix BtΓ−Γ− . It means that the right-hand side of (1.13) is  negative if Γ− 6= ∅ and again we get the contradiction. Thus, Γ− = ∅. The case when Btp > 0 and Atp ≥ 0 is studied similarly. (b) Let C be a strictly monotone operator. In this case U− ⊂ Γ−  andM = Γ−. Then using once again inequality (1.12) and proceeding as in the part (a) of the proof we get the contradiction which proves the assertion M = ∅.  Let now C be a continuous monotone operator. Then Γ− ⊂ U−, M = U−, inequality (1.12) implies  (f1 − f2, η) ≤ (u1 − u2, Atη) ≤ ((u1 − u2)U− , AtU−U−ηU−) (1.14)  and the same arguments as in (a) lead to the inequality ((u1 − u2)U− , A  t U−U−  ηU−) < 0, i. e. to the contradiction.  Remark 1.1. Obviously, comparison Theorem 1.2 implies the uniqueness of the solution (u, γ, δ) ∈ 〈(u, γ, δ), (ū, γ̄, δ̄)〉 for problem (1.1).  1.2 Iterative methods  We study a variant of the multisplitting method, which includes, in particulary, the additive Schwarz alternating method (see [38], [7]) on  97    Domain decomposition and parallel solution. . .  the multisplitting methods for the system of the linear and nonlinear algebraic equations).  Let for l = 1, 2, . . . , p A = Al0−Al1, B = Bl0−Bl1 be the splittings of matrices A,B such that: Al0, B  l 0 areM - matrices, A  l 1 À 0, Bl1 À  0. Let also El À 0 be the diagonal matrices and  ∑p l=1El = Id,  where Id is the unit matrix. We consider the following iterative method for solving problem (1.1):  Al0v k+1 l +B  l 0η  k+1 l + δ  k+1 l = A  l 1u  k +Bl1γ k + f,  ηk+1l ∈ Cv k+1 l , δ  k+1 l ∈ Dv  k+1 l l = 1, 2, . . . , p;  uk+1 =  p∑  l=1  Elv k+1 l ; γ  k+1 =  p∑  l=1  Elη k+1 l ; δ  k+1 =  p∑  l=1  Elδ k+1 l (1.15)  for k = 0, 1, 2, . . . with initial guess (u0, γ0).  Theorem 1.3. Let the assumptions of Theorem 1.2 for problem (1.1) be fulfilled.  Then iterative method (1.15) converges for any initial guess (u0, γ0) from the ordered interval 〈(u, γ), (ū, γ̄)〉, and if (u0, γ0) = (ū, γ̄) ((u0, γ0) = (u, γ)) then the sequence {(uk, γk, δk)} converges monotonically decreasing (increasing) to the unique solution (u∗, γ∗, δ∗) of the problem (1.1).  Proof. First, we note that matrices Al0, B l 0, l = 1, . . . , p keep  all the properties of A and B. Further, using the induction and the comparison result of Theorem 1.2 we prove that (u, γ, δ) and (ū, γ̄, δ̄) are the sub- and supersolutions for all equations in (1.15).  Namely, if (uk, γk, δk) ∈ 〈(u, γ, δ), (ū, γ̄, δ̄)〉, then  Al0ū+B l 0γ̄ + δ̄ À Al1ū+Bl1γ̄ + f À Al1uk +Bl1γk + f  = Al0v k+1 l +B  l 0η  k+1 l + δ  k+1 l ;  and, similarly,  Al0u+B l 0γ + δ ¿ Al0vk+1l +B  l 0η  k+1 l + δ  k+1 l .  98    A. Lapin  Due to Theorem 1.2 the vectors (vk+1l , η k+1 l , δ  k+1 l ) belong to 〈(u, γ, δ),  (ū, γ̄, δ̄)〉 for all l. So, (uk+1, γk+1, δk+1) also belongs to 〈(u, γ, δ), (ū, γ̄, δ̄)〉.  Now we prove the convergence of the iterations of method (1.15). To do this we compare it with the point Jacobi method which will be proved to be convergent. The main idea is to prove that an n-th iteration of method (1.15) with any initial guess from the ordered interval 〈(u, γ), (ū, γ̄)〉 lies between the n-th iterations of the Jacoby method with initial guesses (u0, γ0) = (u, γ) and (u0, γ0) = (ū, γ̄).  The point Jacobi method has the form  A0w k+1 +B0β  k+1 + εk+1 = A1w k +B1β  k + f ;  βk+1 ∈ Cwk+1, εk+1 ∈ Dwk+1 k = 0, 1, 2, . . . (1.16) with A = A0−A1, B = B0−B1, where A0 and B0 are the diagonal parts of the corresponding matrices.  Let (u0, γ0, δ0) ≤ (w0, β0, ε0) = (ū, γ̄, δ̄). Let us prove, that the following statements are valid:  (wk, βk, εk) ↓ (u∗, γ∗, δ∗) when k →∞, (1.17)  (uk, γk, δk)¿ (wk, βk, εk) ∀k. (1.18) We proceed by induction. First we prove the monotone decreasing of the sequence {(wk, βk, εk)}.  Let (wk, βk, εk)¿ (wk−1, βk−1, εk−1) for some k ≥ 1. Then  A0w k+1 +B0β  k+1 + εk+1 = A1w k +B1β  k + f  ¿ A1wk−1 +B1βk−1 + f = A0wk +B0βk + εk, βk+1 ∈ Cwk+1, εk+1 ∈ Dwk+1, βk ∈ Cwk, εk ∈ Dwk  and the comparison result of Theorem 1.2 ensures the inequality  (wk+1, βk+1, εk+1)¿ (wk, βk, εk). (1.19)  The sequence {(wk, βk, εk)} is monotonically decreasing and bounded below by (u, γ, δ), so it converges to a vector (u∗, γ∗, δ∗) À (u, γ, δ). Passing to the limit in (1.16) we derive the equality  Au∗ +Bγ∗ + δ∗ = f.  99    Domain decomposition and parallel solution. . .  From the closeness of maximal monotone operators (cf. [11]) the inclusions γ∗ ∈ Cu∗, and δ∗ ∈ Du∗ follow. It means that {(wk, βk, εk)} converges to the unique solution of problem (1.1).  Now let us prove that (vkl , η k l , δ  k l ) ¿ (wk, βk, εk) for fixed l by  induction in k. Let the desired inequalities hold for some k ≥ 0 and all l (so, (uk, γk, δk) ¿ (wk, βk, εk)). Owing to inequality (1.19), the supposition of the induction and the fact that the matrices A0 − Al0, B0 −Bl0 are non-negative we obtain  Al0w k+1 +Bl0β  k+1 + εk+1 = A0w k+1 +B0β  k+1 + εk+1  −(A0 −Al0)wk+1 − (B0 −Bl0)βk+1  ≥ A0wk+1 +B0βk+1 + εk+1 − (A0 −Al0)wk − (B0 −Bl0)βk  = A0w k+1 +B0β  k+1 + εk+1 − (A1 −Al1)wk − (B1 −Bl1)βk  = f +Al1w k +Bl1β  k ≥ f +Al1uk +Bl1γk = A0vk+1l +B0η k+1 l + δ  k+1 l .  Then (vk+1l , η k+1 l , δ  k+1 l ) ¿ (wk+1, βk+1, εk+1) due to Theorem 1.2,  applied for the equation with the matrices Al0 and B l 0.  Using the same argumentation we can prove that for (u0, γ0, δ0) ≥ (w0, β0, ε0) = (u, γ, δ) the following statements hold:  (wk, βk, εk) ↑ (u∗, γ∗, δ∗) when k →∞,  (uk, γk, δk)À (wk, βk, εk) ∀k. Together with (1.17),(1.18) this leads to the convergence of the sequence {(uk, γk, δk)} to the solution (u∗, γ∗, δ∗) of problem (1.1).  As for the monotone convergence of this sequence when starting from the subsolution or from the supersolution, then the proof of these statements is similar to the previous one (cf. [31]).  1.3 Geometric convergence of iterative  methods  Further we use the following statement, which follow from the proof of Theorem 1.3 .  100    A. Lapin  Remark 1.2. Let (ūk, γ̄k, δ̄k) be a k-th iteration of point Jacobi method (1.16), when starting from the supersolution, while (uk, γk, δ  k) be a k-th iteration of point Jacobi method (1.16), when starting from the subsolution. Then for a k-th iteration of method (1.15) with any initial guess from 〈(u, γ), (ū, γ̄)〉 the following inequalities hold:  (uk, γk, δ k)¿ (uk, γk, δk)¿ (ūk, γ̄k, δ̄k). (1.20)  Owing to (1.20) we have at least the same rate of the convergence for iterative method (1.15) as for the point Jacobi method with the initial guess coinciding with a supersolution and with a subsolution.  Theorem 1.4. Let the assumptions (1.2) - (1.4) for problem (1.1) be fulfilled. Let also one of the following assumptions is valid:  (i) there exists a positive vector p such that  Atp > 0 and Btp > 0,  or (ii) there exists a positive vector p such that  Atp > 0 and BtpÀ 0,  and C is a Lipschitz-continuous operator:  |γi(ui)− γi(vi)| ≤ cL|ui − vi| ∀i, ∀ui, vi or  (iii) there exists a positive vector p such that  AtpÀ 0 and Btp > 0,  and C is an uniformly maximal monotone operator:  (γi − ηi)(ui − vi) ≥ 1/dL(ui − vi)2  ∀i, ∀ui, vi, ∀γi ∈ C(ui), ηi ∈ C(vi). Then there exist q < 1 and M > 0:  ||un − u||∞ + ||γn − γ||∞ ≤Mqn ∀n,  where ||u||∞ = maxi |ui|.  101    Domain decomposition and parallel solution. . .  Proof. Let (ūk, γ̄k, δ̄k) be a k-th iteration of the point Jacobi method with the initial guess, coinciding with the supersolution. Then, since  (ūk − u) ↓ 0, (γ̄k − γ) ↓ 0, (δ̄k − δ) ↓ 0,  we have  A0(ū k+1 − u) +B0(γ̄k+1 − γ)¿ A1(ūk − u) +B1(γ̄k − γ),  or, with the notations zk = A0(ū k − u), ηk = B0(γ̄k − γ),  zk+1 + ηk+1 ¿ S1zk + S2ηk. (1.21)  Here S1 = A1(A0) −1 À 0, S2 = B1(B0)−1 À 0. Let p > 0 and  Atp > 0. Then it is easy to know that Atp À αA0p with a positive α ∈ (0, 1) and St1p ¿ (1 − α)p. The inequality Atp À 0 implies St1p¿ p. Similarly, if Btp > 0 then St2p¿ (1− β)p with a constant β ∈ (0, 1) and in the case BtpÀ 0 we have St2p¿ p.  (i) Multiplying (1.21) by p we obtain  ||zk+1||p+||ηk+1||p ≡ (zk+1+ηk+1, p) ≤ (zk, St1p)+(ηk, St2p), (1.22)  where ||u||p = (|u|, p) = N∑ i=1  pi|ui| is a norm in RN . So,  ||zk+1||p + ||ηk+1||p ≤ (1− α)(zk, p) + (1− β)(ηk, p)  ≤ q(||zk||p + ||ηk||p) with q = max{1− α, 1− β} and  ||A0(ūn − u)||p + ||B0(γ̄n − γ)||p  ≤ qn(||A0(ū− u)||p + ||B0(γ̄ − γ)||p). (1.23) Similarly, if (un, γn, δn) is a n-th iteration of the point Jacobi  method with the initial guess, coinciding with the subsolution, then  ||A0(u− un)||p + ||B0(γ − γn)||p  102    A. Lapin  ≤ qn(||A0(u− u)||p + ||B0(γ − γ)||p). (1.24) Now from (1.20) and (1.23), (1.24) we obtain  ||un − u||∞ + ||γn − γ||∞ ≤M1(||A0(un − u)||∞+  ||B0(γn − γ)||∞) ≤M1max{||A0(u− un) +B0(γ − γn)||∞, ||A0(ūn − u) +B0(γ̄n − γ)||∞}  ≤M1qnmax{||ū− u+ γ̄ − γ||p, ||ū− u+ γ̄ − γ||p} ∀n. (ii) Let again (ūk, γ̄k, δ̄k) be a k-th iteration of the point Ja cobi method with the initial guess, coinciding with the supersolution. Keeping the previous notations we get cki = η  k i /z  k i ∈ [0, cL]. Let Dk1  be the diagonal matrices with the entries (1+ cki ) −1, while Dk2 be the  diagonal matrices with the entries cki /(1+c k i ). Let also w  k = zk+ηk. Then zk = Dk1w  k and ηk = Dk2w k. From inequality (1.22) we derive  ||wk+1||p ≤ (zk, St1p) + (ηk, St2p) = (Dk1wk, St1p) + (Dk2wk, St2p)  ≤ (((1− α)Dk1 +Dk2 )wk, p) ≤ q||wk||p  with q = max i  (1− α) + cki 1 + cki  < 1.  The rest of the proof is the same as in (i). (iii) To prove the statement (iii) of the Theorem we use (ii) and  the fact that the monotone operator C−1 is Lipschitz-continuous with constant dL.  2 Asynchronous domain decomposition methods  for continuous casting problem  Two asynchronous domain decomposition methods (which appear to be a two-stage Schwarz alternating algorithms) to solve the finite difference schemes approximating dynamic continuous casting problem are theoretically and numerically studied. Fully implicit and semi-implicit (implicit for the diffusion operator while explicit for the nonlinear convective term) finite difference schemes are considered. Unique solvability of the finite difference schemes as well as a monotone dependence of the solution upon the right-hand side are  103    Domain decomposition and parallel solution. . .  proved. Geometric rate of convergence for the iterative methods is investigated. All these results follow from the general theory of Section 1.  Numerical results which validate the theoretical ones can be found in [37] .  Stefan problem with prescribed convection, which special case is the continuous casting problem, has been considered in a number of articles (cf., e. g., [24], [44], [45], [46] and the bibliographies therein), where the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution has been proved.  A numerical schemes for this problem, based on an implicit discretization of the diffusion term and an explicit discretization of the nonlinear convection term (semi-implicit scheme in our terminology), has been studied in [20], [21], [22]. A fully implicit approximation of the problem has been considered in [35], where the existence and uniqueness of the solution for the mesh scheme has been proved as well as the convergence of the different iterative methods.  A parallel algorithms for the systems of nonlinear algebraic equations (mesh schemes for the classical Stefan problem are the examples of such systems) have been considered in [7], [48].  2.1 Continuous casting problem and its approxi mation  A continuous casting problem can be stated mathematically as follows. Let Ω = {0 < x1 < Lx1 , 0 < x2 < Lx2} be the rectangular domain with the boundary Γ = ∂Ω consisting of two parts: Γ1 = {x ∈ ∂Ω : x2 = 0 ∨ x2 = Lx2} and Γ2 = {x ∈ ∂Ω \ Γ1}. We assume that the domain Ω ⊂ R2 is occupied by a thermodynamically homogeneous and isotropic steel. We denote by H(x, t) the enthalpy related to the unit mass and by u(x, t) the temperature for (x, t) ∈ Ω×]0, T [. We have constitutive law  H = H(u) = ρ  ∫ u  0  c(Θ)dΘ+ ρL(1− fs(u)) in Ω×]0, T [,  where ρ is density, c(u) is specific heat, L is latent heat and fs(u) is solid fraction.  104    A. Lapin  For a steel casting process the graph H(u) is an increasing function R→ R, involving near vertical segments, which correspond to a phase transition states, namely, for u ∈ [TL, TS] where 0 < TL < TS are melting and solidification temperatures [41]. On the other hand, when a copper casting problem is studied, graph H(u) has a vertical segment for u = TL = TS [27]. Further we include in our consideration both problems and denote byH(u), u ∈ R, a maximal monotone, generally multivalued, graph.  We also suppose, that graph H(u) is uniformly monotone: there exists a positive constant α such that  (γ1 − γ2, u1 − u2) ≥ α(u1 − u2, u1 − u2) ∀u1, u2 ∀γi ∈ H(ui). (2.1)  Now a continuous casting process can be described by a boundaryvalue problem, formally written in the following pointwise form: find u(x, t) and γ(x, t) such that  (P)      ∂γ  ∂t + v  ∂γ  ∂x2 −∆u = 0 for x ∈ Ω, t > 0,  u = z(x1, t) for x ∈ Γ1, t > 0, ∂u  ∂n + au+ b|u|3u = g, a ≥ 0, b ≥ 0, for x ∈ Γ2, t > 0,  γ = H0(x) for x ∈ Ω̄, t = 0, γ(x, t) ∈ H(u(x, t)) for x ∈ Ω, t > 0.  Below we suppose, that the boundary temperature z(x1, t) at any point of Γ1 and for all t ≥ 0 does not coincide with the phase transition temperature TL = TS, in other words, enthalpy function H has a single values at all these points. This corresponds to physical meaning of the problem, because the incoming material (points x ∈ Γ1 : x2 = 0) is in liquid state, while the outcoming material (points x ∈ Γ1 : x2 = Lx2) is in solid state.  The existence and uniqueness of a weak solution for problem (P) are proved in [44].  We approximate problem (P) by an implicit in time finite difference scheme and by a semi-implicit finite difference scheme, using for the approximation in space variables a finite element method with the quadrature rules.  Let Th be a triangulation of Ω in the rectangular elements δ of dimensions h1×h2 and Vh = {uh(x) ∈ H1(Ω) : uh(x) ∈ Q1 for all δ ∈  105    Domain decomposition and parallel solution. . .  Th}, where Q1 is the space of bilinear functions. By Πhv(x) we denote the Vh-interpolant of a continuous function v(x), i. e. Πhv(x) ∈ Vh and coincides with v(x) in the mesh nodes – vertices of all δ ∈ Th. We also use an interpolation operator Ph, which is defined as follows: for any continuous function v(x) the function Phv(x) is piecewise linear in x1, piecewise constant in x2 and on δ = [x1, x1+h1]× [x2, x2+h2] it coincides with v(x) at (x1, x2 + h2) and (x1 + h1, x2 + h2).  Let further V 0h = {uh(x) ∈ Vh : uh(x) = 0 for all x ∈ Γ1}, V zh = {uh(x) ∈ Vh : uh(x) = zh for all x ∈ Γ1}. Here zh is the bilinear interpolation of z on the boundary Γ1. For any continuous function v(x) we define the quadrature formulas:  Sδ(v) =  ∫  δ  Πhvdx, SΩ(v) = ∑  δ∈Th  Sδv,  S∂δ(v) =  ∫  ∂δ  Πhvdx, SΓ2(v) = ∑  ∂δ∈Th∩Γ̄2  S∂δ(v);  Eδ(v) =  ∫  δ  Phvdx, EΩ(v) = ∑  δ∈Th  Eδ(v).  Let also ωτ = {tk = kτ, 0 ≤ k ≤M,Mτ = T} be an uniform mesh in time on the segment [0, T ] and  ∂t̄γ = 1  τ (γ(x, t)− γ(x, t− τ)).  Then the implicit in time finite difference scheme with up-wind approximation of the convective term v∂γ/∂x2 can be written as follows: for all t ∈ ωτ , t > 0, find uh ∈ V zh and γh ∈ Vh such that     SΩ(∂t̄γhηh) + EΩ(v(t) ∂γh ∂x2  ηh) + SΩ(∇uh∇ηh) +SΓ2((auh + b|uh|3uh)ηh) = SΓ2(gηh) for all ηh ∈ V 0h ,  γh(x, t) ∈ H(uh(x, t)) for all mesh nodes x.  (2.2)  When constructing the semi-implicit mesh scheme we approx imate the term  ( ∂  ∂t + v(t)  ∂  ∂x2  ) γ by using the characteristics of  106    A. Lapin  the first order differential operator (similar to [20], [23]). Namely, if (x1, x2, t) is the mesh point on the time level t we choose x̃2 =  x2 − ∫ t  t−τ  v(ξ)dξ and approximate this term by:  ( ∂  ∂t + v(t)  ∂  ∂x2  ) γ ≈ 1  τ (γ(x1, x2, t)− γ(x1, x̃2, t− τ)) .  If x̃2 < 0 then we put  γ̃(x, t− τ) = γ(x1, 0, t− τ). Note, that γ(x1, 0, t−τ) = H(z(x1, t−τ)) with single valuesH(z(x1, t− τ)) of H at these points, as it was mentioned above.  In what follows we use the notation  dt̄γ = 1  τ (γ(x, t)− γ̃(x, t− τ))  for the difference quotient in each mesh point on time level t. Now, the semi-implicit finite difference scheme for problem (P) is:  for all t ∈ ωτ , t > 0, find uh ∈ V zh and γh ∈ Vh such that     SΩ(dt̄γhηh) + SΩ(∇uh∇ηh) + SΓ2((auh + b|uh|3uh)ηh) = SΓ2(gηh) for all ηh ∈ V 0h ,  γh(x, t) ∈ H(uh(x, t)) for all mesh nodes x. (2.3)  Let N0 = card V 0 h and u ∈ RN0 be the vector of nodal values for  uh ∈ V 0h . We use the writing uh ⇔ u for this bijection. We define N0×N0 matrices A and B and nonlinear operator C by the following relations: for all V 0h 3 uh ⇔ u ∈ RN0 and V 0h 3 ηh ⇔ η ∈ RN0  (Au, η) = SΩ(∇uh∇ηh) + SΓ2(auhηh),  (Bu, η) = SΩ( 1  τ uhηh) + EΩ(v(t)  ∂uh ∂x2  ηh),  (Cu, η) = SΓ2(b|uh|3uhηh). Let now z̃h(x) ∈ Vh be the function which is equal to zh on Γ̄1 and 0 for all nodes in Ω ∪ Γ2. We define the vectors f and f0 by the equalities:  (f, η) = SΓ2(gηh) + SΩ( 1  τ γh(x, t− τ)ηh),  107    Domain decomposition and parallel solution. . .  (f0, η) = SΩ(∇z̃h,∇ηh) + EΩ(v(t) ∂Πh(H(z̃h))  ∂x2 ηh)  for all ηh ∈ V 0h . (Here we use again the fact, that the graph H(u) is single-valued for u = z̃h(x), when x is a mesh point). Finally we get F = f − f0.  In these notations the algebraic form for the implicit mesh scheme (2.2) at fixed time level is:  Au+Bγ + Cu = F, γ ∈ H(u). (2.4)  If we set  (Bu, η) = SΩ( 1  τ uhηh)  and  (f, η) = SΓ2(gηh) + SΩ( 1  τ γ̃hηh),  then the semi-implicit mesh scheme (2.3) has also the algebraic form (2.4).  The proof of the following lemma is straightforward:  Lemma 2.1. The matrices A, B and the operators C, H have the following properties:  A and B are M -matrices; (2.5)  A is weakly diagonally dominant in columns:  N0∑  j 6=i  |aji|/aii ≤ 1 ∀i; (2.6)  B is strictly diagonally dominant in columns:  N0∑  j 6=i  |bji|/bii ≤ β < 1 ∀i (2.7)  (in fact, for the semi-implicit scheme matrix B is diagonal); operators H and C have the diagonal forms:  { H(u) = (H(u1), H(u2), . . . , H(uN0))  t,  Cu = (c1(u1), c2(u2), . . . , cN (uN0)) t,  (2.8)  108    A. Lapin  where ci are continuous non-decreasing functions and H(.) is maximal monotone and uniformly monotone graph (see (2.1)).  Note, that β = τ/(τ + h2) for the case of implicit finite difference scheme, while β = 0 for the semi-implicit scheme.  It is easy to prove that there exist a subsolution (u, γ):  Au+Bγ + Cu ≤ F, γ ∈ H(u), (2.9)  and a supersolution (ū, γ̄):  Aū+Bγ̄ + Cū ≥ F, γ̄ ∈ H(ū) (2.10)  for problem (2.4). In fact, to construct a supersolution we choose a vector ū with  coordinates ūi ≡ c1 = const, corresponding to the nodes in Ω \ Γ̄1, while ūi = zi for the coordinates, corresponding to the nodes in Γ̄1. If c1 is sufficiently big and γ̄i ∈ H(ūi) then the pair (ū, γ̄) is a supersolution for problem (2.4). Similarly, if u has coordinates ui ≡ c2 = const, corresponding to the nodes in Ω\Γ̄1, while ūi = zi for the coordinates , corresponding to the nodes in Γ̄1 with sufficiently small c2 and γi ∈ H(ui) then the pair (u, γ) is a subsolution for problem (2.4).  The properties (2.5) - (2.10) ensure the validity of all assumptions of Theorems 1.1, 1.2 for algebraic problem (2.4). Thus, the following statement holds:  Theorem 2.1. The implicit mesh scheme (2.2) and the semiimplicit mesh scheme (2.3) have the unique solutions.  2.2 Iterative methods  The general idea of the Schwarz alternating methods is to solve the boundary value problem restricted to each subdomain, using as the boundary conditions the function values of the approximative solution of the neighboring subdomains. One of the advantages of the additive Schwarz is that the solutions in the subdomains can be handled by the different processors of a parallel computer. However, due to the mutual waits among the processors when a synchronous method is applied, it leads to high lost of calculating time. To exploit the  109    Domain decomposition and parallel solution. . .  asynchronous parallel computing capacity of a multiprocessor system, we propose and investigate theoretically and numerically the asynchronous algorithms for solving “highly” nonlinear finite-dimensional problem.  Algorithm 1 (ASM1)  1. Divide the domain of a boundary-value problem into p overlapping subdomains and construct approximative subproblems in these subdomains.  2. Solve simultaneously the subproblems in the slave processors.  3. When the local stopping criterion in a slave processor is reached, send information about this to the master processor and keep calculating further.  4. When all slaves have finished the calculations, send the subsolutions to the master processor for updating the information for all slave processors.  5. If the accuracy is reached, then STOP, else goto 2.  Algorithm 2 (ASM2)  1. Divide the domain of a boundary-value problem into p overlapping subdomains and construct approximative subproblems in these subdomains.  2. Solve simultaneously the subproblems in the slave processors.  3. When the local stopping criterion in a slave processor is reached, send subsolution to the master processor and check if there is a new information from the neighboring subdomains. If yes, then update it and restart the calculations, otherwise keep calculating further.  4. When all slaves have finished the calculations, send the subsolutions to the master processor for updating the information for all slave processors.  110    A. Lapin  5. If the accuracy is reached, then STOP, else goto 2.  In the Algorithm 1 we do not use the newest available information. This slows the convergence. Although it is much faster to just send sign to the master that the processor is ready than send the whole subsolution.  In the Algorithm 2 we send the subsolution to the master whenever it is gained. This increase the total calculation time. On the other hand we use the newest available information which decreases the calculation time.  Intuitively if there is a large load imbalance, i. e. if some processors have substantially more work than others, one can expect the asynchronous versions to converge faster than the synchronous one. It is also expected that ASM2 would be faster than ASM1. We will discuss these questions in more details.  For the simplicity but without loss of generality we suppose that the domain Ω is decomposed into two overlapping subdomains Ω1 and Ω2, consisting of the elements of triangulation Th. We arrange the nodes of the mesh as follows. First, we enumerate the nodes lying in the non-overlapping part of the first subdomain, namely x ∈ (Ω̄1 \ Γ̄1) \ ¯Ω1 ∩ Ω2, then the nodes in the overlapping zone x ∈  ¯Ω1 ∩ Ω2 \ Γ̄1 and at last the nodes in the non-overlappping part of the second subdomain. A vector u ∈ RN0 , u⇔ uh(x), takes the form u = (u11, u12, u22)  t with subvectors uij corresponding to enumaration of the nodes.  This decomposition implies also the partitioning of the matrices and nonlinear operators:  A = (Aij) 3 ij=1, B = (Bij)  3 ij=1, C = diag(C1, C2, C3).  Note, thatAij ¿ 0, Bij ¿ 0 for i 6= j and the blocksA13, A31, B13, B31 are equal to zero.  We use also the following notations:  A10 =  ( A11 A12 A21 A22  ) , B10 =  ( B11 B12 B21 B22  ) ,  A20 =  ( A22 A23 A32 A33  ) , B20 =  ( B22 B23 B32 B33  ) ,  111    Domain decomposition and parallel solution. . .  A11 = diag(0, A23), B 1 1 = diag(0, B23),  A21 = diag(A21, 0), B 2 1 = diag(B21, 0),  C1 = diag(C1, C2), C 2 = diag(C2, C3).  Let further u1 = (u11, u12)  t, u2 = (u12, u22) t  and similar for all other vectors. Then ASAM has the form (2.11), (2.12):      A10v k+1 1 +B  1 0η  k+1 1 + C  1vk+11 = F1 −A11uk2 −B11γk2 , A20w  k+1 2 +B  2 0ξ  k+1 2 + C  2wk+12 = F2 −A21uk1 −B21γk1 , ηk+11 ∈ H(vk+11 ), ξk+12 ∈ H(wk+12 ),  (2.11)  { uk+111 = v  k+1 11 , u  k+1 22 = w  k+1 22 , u  k+1 12 = αv  k+1 12 + (1− α)wk+112 ,  γk+111 = η k+1 11 , γ  k+1 22 = ξ  k+1 22 , γ  k+1 12 = αη  k+1 12 + (1− α)ξk+112 ,  (2.12) with an initial guess (u0, γ0) and α ∈ [0, 1].  Let now every subproblem in (2.11) be solved by using a finite number of iterations of an inner iterative algorithm. Then we derive a two-stage ASAM. Below we write two-stage ASAMs, corresponding to ASM1 and ASM2 from Introduction.  Let for i = 1, 2  Ai0 =Mi +Ni, B i 0 = Ki + Li  be the regular splittings of A and B with diag(Ai0) ⊆Mi, diag(Bi0) ⊆ Ki and Ni ¿ 0, Li ¿ 0. Starting from the initial guess  z1,0 = u k 1, z2,0 = u  k 2, ε1,0 = γ  k 1 , ε2,0 = γ  k 2 ,  we solve the subproblems in (2.11) by the iterative methods  { M1z1,i +K1ε1,i + C  1z1,i = ϕ k 1 −N1z1,i−1 − L1ε1,i−1,  ε1,i ∈ H(z1,i), i = 1, . . . , p1, (2.13)  { M2z2,i +K2ε2,i + C  2z2,i = ϕ k 2 −N1z2,i−1 − L1ε2,i−1,  ε2,i ∈ H(z2,i), i = 1, . . . , p2, (2.14)  112    A. Lapin  set  vk+11 ≡ z1,p1 , ηk+11 ≡ ε1,p1 ; wk+12 ≡ z2,p2 , ξk+12 ≡ ε2,p2 and then update the outer iterations using formulas (2.12).  Here  ϕk1 = F1 −A11uk2 −B11γk2 , ϕk2 = F2 −A21uk1 −B21γk1 for method ASM1, when we calculate all subproblems by using inner iterative methods until we reach the desired accuracy in all subproblems and after that send calculated vk+11 , w  k+1 2 , η  k+1 1 , ξ  k+1 2 to master  processor to update the outer iterations by using formulas (2.12). On the other hand, for method ASM2 the formulas for ϕki are changed by  ϕk1 = F1 −A11wk+12 −B11ξk+12 or by  ϕk2 = F2 −A21vk+11 −B21ηk+11 , depending on which of subproblems was solved faster.  The proof of the following statement is simple and direct.  Lemma 2.2. The matrices in all iterative methods (2.11), (2.13), (2.14) inherit the properties of the matrices A and B, namely, for i = 1, 2  Ai0,Mi are weakly diagonally dominant in columns,  and Bi0,Ki are strictly diagonally dominant in columns  are M-matrices.  Using Theorem 1.2, we can prove also the following  Lemma 2.3. The pairs (ū, γ̄) and (u, γ) are, respectively, a supersolution and a subsolution for all problems (2.11), (2.13), (2.14).  Owing to Lemma 2.2, Lemma 2.3 and to Theorem 1.1, all iterative methods (2.11), (2.12) and (2.13), (2.14), (2.12) are correctly defined.  Moreover, the assumptions of Theorem 1.4 (i) are fulfilled with the vector p = (1, . . . , 1)t, so we have  113    Domain decomposition and parallel solution. . .  Theorem 2.2. Iterative methods (2.11), (2.12) and (2.13), (2.14), (2.12) with an initial guess (u0, γ0) ∈ 〈(u, γ), (ū, γ̄)〉 converge with geometric rate of convergence:  ||A0(un − u) +B0(γn − γ)||∞ ≤Mqn (2.15)  with q = cAB + αβ  cAB + α < 1. Here  cAB = 2τ(1 + h22/h  2 1)  h2(τ + h2)  for the implicit scheme, while  cAB = 2τ(1 + h22/h  2 1)  h22  for the semi-implicit scheme.  3 Domain decomposition method  for dam problem  The problem of the water filtration through and under the dam with the permeable foundation and with the immovable fluid under the dam of greater density than in moving water is studied. The liquids are supposed immiscible. In this case the unknown domain of the filtration has two free boundaries, namely, depression surface which separate the wet and the dry parts of the dam and the interface between two fluids.  Finite difference scheme is constructed and written in the form (1.1). The study of this mesh scheme and iterative algorithms of its numerical solution is performed on the basis of the results of Section 1. The numerical results which confirm the theoretical ones can be found in [36], [37].  First variational formulation of the dam problem was given in Baiocchi’s article [10] where the dam of the rectangular form was considered. A number of the articles concerned this class of the dam problem (cf. survey [15] and the bibliography of this survey).  114    A. Lapin  The new mathematical model for the filtration problem in the dam of arbitrary geometry was constructed in [1] and [16]. The existence of a weak solution was proved. The uniqueness problem was solved in [18], [19]. The properties of the free boundary were studied in [3]. The main results in this field can be found in the monograph [25], cf. also [17].  The mesh schemes for the dam problem with arbitrary geometry of the dam were firstly studied in [2] and then in [14], [42]. The mixed formulation of free boundary problems of fluid flow and mixed finite element methods in its approximation were proposed and studied in [9].  Parallel solution of the dam problem are discussed in [26], [47], where the mesh scheme for Baiocchi’s model is considered.  The mathematical model of the problem that we consider here was formulated and studied in [32]. The existence of the unique weak solution was proved, the weak convergence of a sequence of approximate solutions which were constructed via finite element approximation was proved. The uniqueness of the approximate solution as well as the convergence of the Schwarz-type iterative methods were studied in [36] on the basis of our results on the solution of the finite-dimensional variational inequalities with several multivalued operators (see [30], [31]).  3.1 Statement of the problem, mesh  approximation  LetD be an open parallelepiped in Rn, D = ∪5i=1Ωi, where Ω3,Ω4 are the known subdomains corresponding to the water pool and the subdomain with atmospheric air, while other subdomains are unknown. They have the following sense: Ω1 is the domain of water filtration (saturated part of the dam), Ω5 is the dry part of the dam and Ω2 corresponds to the domain occupied by the immovable fluid under the dam.  Further we use also some more notations for the subdomains of D. Namely, D+ = D̄ ∩ {xn ≥ 0}, D− = D̄ ∩ {xn ≤ 0}, Ω1 = int( ¯Ω+1 ∪ Ω−1 ), where Ω+1 = {x ∈ Ω1|xn > 0},Ω−1 = {x ∈ Ω1|xn < 0}, Ω = Ω1 ∪ Ω2 ∪ Ω5.  115    Domain decomposition and parallel solution. . .  Let S0 = ∂Ω1 ∩ Ω̄5 be the depression surface, S1 = ∂Ω1 ∩ Ω̄2 be the interface between the filtrating water and immovable fluid; H0 = sup{xn| x ∈ D} be the piezometric head in the water pool, H1 = inf{xn| x ∈ D}. The boundary ∂D of the domain D consists of Γ2 = D̄ ∩ {xn = H0  ∨ xn = H1} and Γ1 = ∂D \ Γ2. On the other  hand, ∂Ω1 = S0 ∪S1 ∪ γ1 ∪ γ2 ∪ γ3, where γ1 = Γ1 ∩ Ω̄1, γ2 = Ω̄3 ∩ Ω̄1 and γ3 = Ω̄4 ∩ Ω̄1. At last, let γ0 = Ω1 ∩ {xn = 0}.  We suppose that the angle between the vector of external normal to Ω in the points of γ2∪γ3 and the positive direction of the coordinate axis xn is less or equal to π/2.  xn  (x1, ..., xn�1)  H0  H1  � 2  2  2    3  1    +1  S0    �1  S1  � 2    2  3    5    4  3  Figure 1: The dam  Let the linear (Darcy’s) filtration law be fulfilled for the liquid:  v = −k∇(p+ xn)  with piecewise constant coefficient of the filtration k(x) = {k1 for xn > 0; k2 for xn < 0}, ki > 0. The density of the filtrating water is supposed to be 1 while the density of the immovable liquid is ρ > 1.  116    A. Lapin  We look for the function p = p(x) (pressure field) satisfying the following relations in the points of Ω1 ∪ ∂Ω1:  divv = 0, x ∈ Ω+1 ∪ Ω−1 ;  p|γ+0 = p|γ−0 ; v · n|γ+0 + v · n|γ−0 = 0; v · n = 0 on γ1; p = H0 − xn on γ2;  p = 0,v · n ≥ 0 on γ3; p = pd,v · n = 0 on S0 ∪ S1. Here pd = {0 for xn ≥ 0;−ρxn for xn < 0} is given function corresponding to the hydrostatical pressure in the immovable fluid (xn < 0) and to atmospheric pressure for xn ≥ 0;n stands for the unit normal vector for the corresponding part of the boundary Ω1.  Let z = p− pd, g = {k1 for xn > 0; k2(1− ρ) for xn < 0}, and  K̄ = {u ∈ H1(D)|u(x) ≥ 0 in D \ Ω̄4;u(x) = H0 − xn in Ω̄3;  u(x) = 0 in Ω̄4 ∪ Γ2}; M̄ = {u ∈ H1(D)|u(x) ≥ 0 in Ω̄4;u = 0 in Ω̄3 ∪ Γ2}.  The weak solution of the problem is the pair (z, χ) ∈ K̄ × L∞, such that {∫  D (k∇z∇η + χgηxn)dx ≤ 0 ∀η ∈ M̄,  χ(x) ∈ H(z(x)) a. e. in D. (3.1)  We approximate the problem (3.1) by the finite difference scheme, constructing it via finite element method with the quadrature formulas.  Let us decompose the closed domain D̄ by the planes parallel to the coordinate ones (the plain xn = 0 being one of them) into the set τh of the parallelepipeds (finite elements). The index h corresponds to the maximal diameter of the elements δ ∈ τh. Let furtherQ1 be the space of the polynomials  ∑1 αi=0  aαx α1 1 . . . x  αn n (polilinear functions)  and the finite element spaces be defined by Vh = {uh ∈ C(D̄)|uh ∈ Q1 for every δ ∈ τh}, V0h = {uh ∈ Vh : uh(x) = 0 ∀x ∈ Γ2}.  We denote by Ω3h(Ω4h) the family of δ ∈ τh which are in Ω3(Ω4). Below we use the following notations for the sets of mesh func tions:  K0h = {uh ∈ Vh|uh(x) ≥ 0 in D \ Ω̄4h; uh(x) = 0 in Ω̄4h};  117    Domain decomposition and parallel solution. . .  K1h = {uh ∈ V0h|uh(x) = H0 − xn in Ω̄3h};Kh = K0h ∩K1h, Mh = {uh ∈ V0h|uh ≥ 0 in Ω̄4h;uh = 0 in Ω̄3h}.  On every δ ∈ τh, δ = ∏n  i=1[ai, bi], we use several quadrature formulas. Namely, if the set of the vertices of δ is partitioned into the two subsets: ω+(δ), which stands for the vertices in the plane xn = bn and ω−(δ) which contains the set of vertices in the plane xn = an, then the quadrature formulas are defined by the equalities  S+δ (v) = 2 −(n−1)|δ|  ∑  x∈ω+(δ)  v(x);  S−δ (v) = 2 −(n−1)|δ|  ∑  x∈ω−(δ)  v(x); Sδ(v) = 2 −1(S+δ (v) + S  − δ (v)).  Here v ∈ C(δ̄) and |δ| =measure δ. By S+, S−, S we denote the compound quadratures in the corre sponding subdomains of the domain D̄:  S+(v) = ∑  δ∈D+  S+δ (v), S −(v) =  ∑  δ∈D−  S−δ (v), S(v) = ∑  δ∈D̄  Sδ(v).  Let us define the following functions:  g1(x) = {k1 for xn ≥ 0; 0 for xn < 0}, g2(x) = {0 for xn > 0; k2(1− ρ) for xn ≤ 0},  k0(x) = {|δ|−1 ∫  δ  k(x)dx ∀x ∈ δ, ∀δ ∈ τh}.  By the solution of the mesh scheme for problem (3.1) we call the pair of the functions (zh, χh) ∈ Kh × V0h which satisfy the following relations:      S(k0 · ∇zh · ∇ηh) + S+ ( g1 · χh ·  ∂ηh ∂xn  )  +S− ( g2 · χh ·  ∂ηh ∂xn  ) ≤ 0 ∀ηh ∈Mh,  χh(x) ∈ H(zh(x)) ∀x ∈ D̄.  (3.2)  The existence of the unique solution of problem (3.1) as well as the existence of a solution for mesh scheme (3.2) are proved in [32].  118    A. Lapin  3.2 Algebraic form of the mesh scheme, existence  of the unique solution  Let ω̄ be the set of all mesh nodes, i. e. the set of all vertices of the elements δ ∈ τh. To a function vh ∈ Vh corresponds the vector of its nodal parameters v, i. e. the vector of its values in the nodes of ω̄. We denote by v ⇔ vh this correspondence. Later we use the notation ω̄ for the set of indices of the vector v as well.  To construct the algebraic form of the mesh scheme (3.2) we define several subsets of the set of mesh nodes (subset of indices):  ωk = Ω̄kh ∩ ω, k = 3, 4; ∂ω = Γ ∩ ω̄; ∂2ω = Γ̄2 ∩ ω̄; ω = ω̄ \ ∂2ω;  ∂1ω = ∂ω \ ∂2ω; ∂0ω = ω̄ ∩ {xn = 0}; ω0 = ω \ ∂0ω. By K0,K1,K,M we denote the closed convex sets of vectors v such that, e. g., K0 3 v ⇔ vh ∈ K0h etc.  Let the matrices A,B be defined by the equalities:  (Az, η) = S(k0 · ∇zh · ∇ηh),  (Bχ, η) = S+(g1 · χh · ∂ηh ∂xn  ) + S−(g2 · χh · ∂ηh ∂xn  )  + 1  h+n  ∑  δ∈T+  S−(g1 · χh · ηh + 1  h−n  ∑  δ∈T−  S+(g2 · χh · ηh),  where z ⇔ zh ∈ V0h, η ⇔ ηh ∈ V0h. Here T+ (T−) are the set of finite elements which are adjacent to xn = 0 from above (from below), while 1/h+n and 1/h  − n are the mesh steps in xn-direction for  the corresponding finite elements. Let the diagonal maximal monotone operator C1 be defined by  the equalities:  c1i (zi) = H(zi) for i ∈ ω0, c1i (zi) = 0 for i ∈ ∂0ω.  Further we define the sets:  K2 = {v : vi ≤ 0 ∀i ∈ ω4},  F = K1 ∩K2 = {v : vi ⇔ H0 − xn ∀i ∈ ω3, vi ≤ 0 ∀i ∈ ω4}  119    Domain decomposition and parallel solution. . .  Let C2 = ∂IF be the subdifferential of the indicator function IF of the set F . Then D is the diagonal maximal monotone operator.  In these notations the problem (3.2) can be written in the form  Az +Bχ+ η = 0; χ ∈ C1(z), η ∈ C2(z). (3.3)  Lemma 3.1. ([36]) The matrices A,B in problem (3.3) are the M -matrices with weak diagonal dominance in columns.  Let us now construct a subsolution and a supersolution for the problem (3.3).  Let the mesh function z̃h ∈ Vh is such that z̃h = {H̃0−xn for xn ≥ 0, H̃0 + (ρ− 1)xn for xn < 0} with H̃0 ≥ H0 ensuring the inequality z̃h(x) ≥ 0. We define the vector z̄ by the following relations:  z̄ ⇔ z̃h(x) in the nodes of ω \ (ω3 ∪ ω4),  z̄i = 0 for i ∈ ω4, z̄ = H0 − xn in the nodes of ω3.  Let further χ̄i = 1 where z̄i > 0 except i ∈ ∂0ω where χ̄i = 0 as well as χ̄i = 0 for i ∈ ω4.  At last, let η̄i = 0 for i ∈ ω \ (ω3 ∪ ω4) and η̄i =max{0, (−Ãz̄ − Bχ̄)i} for i ∈ (ω3 ∪ ω4).  Now, let us define the vector z by the following equalities:  zi = 0 for i ∈ ω ∪ ω4,  z = H0 − xn in the nodes of ω3. Let further χ  i = 1 where zi > 0 except i ∈ ∂0ω where χi = 0 as well  as χ i = 0 for i ∈ ω ∪ ω4.  At last, let η i = 0 for i ∈ ω∪ω4 and ηi = (−Az−Bχ)i for i ∈ ω3.  Lemma 3.2. The triple (z̄, χ̄, η̄) is a supersolution for the problem (3.3). The triple (z, χ, η) is a subsolution for the problem (3.3).  Let us now construct a vector p such that Atp > 0 and Btp > 0. To this end we choose a continuous positive function fp(x), which satisfies the following properties. It is piecewise smooth, namely,  120    A. Lapin  smooth in D+ and D−, strictly concave, strictly increasing in xn in the subdomain D+, while strictly decreasing in the subdomain D−. After that we take as the vector p the nodal values of this function. Then it is easy to know, that (Az, p) > 0 and (Bz, p) > 0 for any positive z that means Atp > 0 and Btp > 0.  Summarizing the results and using Theorems 1.1, 1.2, we derive  Theorem 3.1. The algebraic problem (3.3), so, the mesh scheme (3.2) has the unique solution (z, γ, η).  3.2.1 Iterative methods  We decompose the domainD into p overlapping subdomains. For this decomposition we construct the diagonal matrices El À 0,  ∑p l=1El =  Id and the splittings A = Al0 − Al1, B = Bl0 − Bl1 of the matrices A and B. Namely, let ωl be the nodes of the triangulation τh in the subdomain Ω̄l, consisting of the elements ∆ ∈ τh. We define the entries elii of the matrix El by e  l ii = 1 for i corresponding to the  nodes which lie in the non-overlapping part of Ωl, elii = 0 for the nodes outside of Ωl and elii ∈ [0, 1] in the overlapping parts of Ωl. To construct Al0, B  l 0 we proceed as follows. Let V  l h = {vh ∈ V0h : vh ≡  0 for x 6∈ Ω̄l} and  Sl,+(v) = ∑  δ∈Ω̄l∩D+  S+δ (v), S l,−(v) =  ∑  δ∈Ω̄l∩D−  S−δ (v),  Sl(v) = ∑  δ∈Ω̄l  Sδ(v).  First, we define  (Al0z, η) = S l(k0 · ∇zh · ∇ηh),  where z ⇔ zh ∈ V lh, η ⇔ ηh ∈ V lh. The constructed matrices are the blocks of A. We accomplish them with the diagonal elements of A to derive the matrices of the same dimension as A (keeping the same notation).  It is easy to check that the constructed matrices Al0 have the same properties as the matrix A. We set Al1 = A−Al0.  By a similar way we construct the matrices Bl0 and B l 1.  121    Domain decomposition and parallel solution. . .  Owing to the definition of the diagonal matrices El the constructed iterative method can be viewed as the additive Schwarz method. The assumptions of Theorem 1.3 and Theorem 1.4 are fulfilled, so this iterative method converges with the linear rate of the convergence.  References  [1] Alt H.W.
