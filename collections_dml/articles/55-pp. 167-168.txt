 THE RECOMMENDED AUTOMATIC SELECTION SYSTEM UDC  G.S. Yamalytdinova  We consider the most popular classifiers for systematization of scientific information. There are proposed the using recommender system for automation of the classification process and Tanimoto’s measure for proximity evaluation. We give an algorithm of forming classificator’s dictionary. There is a version of the automatic selection for the UDC service. Keywords: recommendatory system, classifier, UDC, systematization of scientific information.  UDC 517.98  ON SOME OPERATOR INEQUALITIES A.A. Sami1  1 samialbarkish@gmail.com; Kazan Federal University  We prove some operator inequalities for a Hilbert space.  Keywords: Hilbert space, linear operator, projection, operator inequality, hyponormal operator.  Let B(H) be a *- algebra of all bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space H , I be the identity operator. An operator a ∈ B(H) is hyponormal if a∗a ≥ aa∗ [1]. Let B(H)pr = {p ∈ B(H) : p = p2 = p∗}.  Theorem 1. Let x, y ∈ B(H) and z = x+y . Then x∗x+ℜ(z∗y) = y∗y+ℜ(z∗x) ≥ 34 z∗z. We have also x∗x +ℜ(z∗y) ≥ 3  4Ĺ y∗y .  Corollary 1. Let x, y ∈ B(H) and z = x + y . i. We have x∗x +ℜ(z∗y) ≥ 3  4Ĺ (λy∗y + (1−λ)z∗z) for all 0 ≤λ≤ 1.  ii. If y ( or z) is left invertible, then x∗x +ℜ(z∗y) is invertible.    168 МАТЕРИАЛЫ МОЛОДЕЖНОЙ ШКОЛЫ-КОНФЕРЕНЦИИ  iii. We have y∗y ≥ ϵI ( or z∗z ≥ ϵI ) for some number ϵ> 0. Thus, x∗x +ℜ(z∗y) ≥ 3ϵ 4Ĺ  I .  Theorem 2. Let x, y ∈ B(H) and z = x + y . Then for all numbers a,b > 0 we have (1−a)x∗x + (1− 1  aĹ )y∗y ≤ z∗z ≤ (1+b)x∗x + (1+ 1Ĺ  bĹ )y∗y.  Via Theorem 1 and 2 we have Corollary 2. Let x, y ∈ B(H) and z = x + y . Then for all a > 0 we have  x∗x +ℜ(z∗y) = y∗y +ℜ(z∗x) ≥ 3 4Ĺ  ((1−a)x∗x + (1− 1 aĹ  )y∗y).  Theorem 3. Suppose p, q ∈ B(H)pr and a = p +λp with λ ∈ C R, then the following conditions are equivalent:  i an operator a∗a −aa∗ is invertible; ii the operators p −q , p⊥−q are invertible.  Under this conditions operator a is invertible. Theorem 4. Suppose b ∈ B(H)sa, q ∈ B(H)pr , a = b +λq with λ ∈C\R.  Then the following conditions are equivalent:  i. an operator a is hyponormal;  ii. bq = qb. Under this conditions an operator a is normal.  References  1. Halmos P.R.
