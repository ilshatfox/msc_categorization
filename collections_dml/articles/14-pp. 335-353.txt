 SOME PROPERTIES OF MEANS OF BLOCH FUNCTIONS  1. Introduction and results. Let ∆ be the unit disc |z| < 1. For an analytic function f in ∆ we set  ‖f‖B = sup z∈∆  (1− |z|2)|f ′(z)|.  The Bloch class B is the set of all analytic functions f on ∆ for which ‖f‖B < ∞. The quantity |f(0)| + ‖f‖B defines the norm of the linear space B which equipped with this norm is a Banach space (see, e.g. [1], [12]).  351    The space B0 consists of all f ∈ B such that (1 − |z|2)|f ′(z)| → 0, as |z| → 0, and B1 consists of all f ∈ B such that if {zn} ⊂ ∆ and |f(zn)| → ∞ then (1− |zn|2)|f ′(zn)| → 0. Note that B0 ⊂ B1 ⊂ B.  Let S be the standard class of analytic univalent functions f in ∆ normalized by f(0) = f ′(0)− 1 = 0. For a ∈ ∆, let the Möbius mapping ϕa : ∆ −→ ∆ be given by the formula  ϕ(z) = ϕa(z) = e iθ a + z  1 + āz  where θ ∈ R. In [11] the notion of linearly invariant family was given as a class M of functions h(z) = z + · · · analytic and locally univalent in ∆ and satisfying the following condition:  for every Möbius mapping ϕ and every h ∈M the function  Fϕ(z) = h(ϕ(z))− h(ϕ(0))  h′(ϕ(0))ϕ′(0) = z + . . .  belongs to M. The number  ord h = sup{|F ′′ϕ(0)|/2 : ϕ is a Möbius mapping, ϕ(∆) = ∆}  we call the order of the function h. There are many interesting examples of linearly invariant families (see [11]).  The universal linearly invariant (or Möbius invariant) family Uα is the class of all functions h(z) = z + . . . analytic and locally univalent on ∆ such that ordh 6 α. Ch. Pommerenke [11] showed that Uα = ∅ for α < 1, U1 is the well known class of convex functions, and S ⊂ U2.  In [15] the second author introduced the following linearly invariant family of functions Uα′ ⊂ Uα.  Definition 1. The family Uα′ consists of all functions f such that  f ′(z) = exp [ −2  ∫ 2π 0  log(1− zeit) dµ(t) ]  , (1.1)  where µ(t) is a complex-valued function with bounded variation on [0, 2π) such that ∣∣∣∣ ∫ 2π  0  dµ(t)− 1 ∣∣∣∣ +  ∫ 2π 0  | dµ(t)| 6 α, α > 1. (1.2)  For many extremal problems in Uα extremal functions belong to Uα′. In [16] it was given the following  352    Definition 2. The family Uα∗ consists of all functions f such that there exist a convex univalent function s(z) = z + . . . (note that s ∈ U1 = U′1) and a Schwartz function ω (analytic in ∆, ω(∆) ⊂ ∆, ω(0) = 0) such that  f ′(z) = s′(z) exp [ −2  ∫ 2π 0  log(1− ω(z)eit) dµ(t) ]  , (1.3)  where µ(t) is a complex-valued function with bounded variation on [0, 2π) such that ∫ 2π  0  |dµ(t)| 6 α− 1, ∫ 2π  0  dµ(t) = 0. (1.4)  Uα∗ is a linearly invariant family of order α; Uα∗ ⊂ Uα. The families Uα∗ and Uα′ are not contained in each other for α > 1.  In [3] (see also [9]) it was shown that g ∈ B if and only if, there exists a function f ∈  ⋃ α<∞  Uα such that  g(z)− g(0) = log f ′(z). (1.5) A function g belongs to the space BMOA if g ∈ H1 and the boundary values of  g on the unit circle T belong to BMO(T), or equivalently, if the function g(ϕa(z))− g(ϕa(0)) belongs to H1 for every a ∈ ∆. The main properties of the space BMOA one can find in [2], [6].  Since BMOA * H.  it seems to be interesting to find the set of all functions f ∈ ⋃  α<∞ Uα for which  log f ′ ∈ BMOA. In the paper we give a partial answer to this problem. In the next theorem we give a relationship between the families Uα′, Uα∗ and  BMOA.  Theorem 1. i) f ∈ ⋃α<∞Uα′ =⇒ log f ′ ∈ BMOA; ii) f ∈ ⋃α<∞Uα∗ =⇒ log f ′ ∈ BMOA. Now we will prepare a ground for integral means in the Bloch space. For 0 < p < ∞ and analytic in ∆ function g we define  Ip(r, g) = 1  2π  ∫ π −π |g(reiθ)|p dθ, 0 < r < 1.  Clunie and MacGregor [4], and Makarov [10] proved the sharp estimate  Ip(r, f) = O((log 1  1− r ) p/2), r → 1,  353    for p ∈ (0,∞) and f ∈ B. What is known about the integral means of the derivatives of Bloch functions?  Girela [8] proved that if f ∈ B1, then  lim inf r→1  (1− r)2I2(r, f ′) = 0.  Moreover there exists a function f ∈ B such that  lim r→1  (1− r)2I2(r, f ′) > 0.  In this paper we characterize the integral means of functions from B0.  Theorem 2. For a given function ϕ(x) positive and (sufficiently slowly) decreasing with lim  x→∞ ϕ(x) = 0 there exists a function f ∈ B0 such that  lim inf r→1  (1− r)2I2(r, f ′) ϕ(− log(1− r)) = ∞.  Let us note that if f ∈ B0 and r → 1, then the expression (1 − r)2I2(r, f ′) can tend to 0 sufficiently slowly.  2. Proofs of results. Proof of Theorem 1. Let f be a function from a linearly invariant family M.  Then fa(z) =  f((z + a)/(1 + āz))− f(a) f ′(a)(1− |a|2) ∈ M,  for every a ∈ ∆. We have  log f ′a(z) = log f ′(  z + a  1 + āz )− log f ′(a)− 2 log(1 + āz).  Note that log(1 + z) ∈ BMOA (1 + z is univalent, and 1 + z 6= 0; see for example [2]). Since the function 1+ āz is subordinated to 1+z for every a ∈ ∆, by Littlewood theorem (see [5])  ‖ log(1 + āz)‖H1 6 ‖ log(1 + z)‖H1 , a ∈ ∆.  Thus we have the following inequality ∫ 2π  0  | log f ′( re iθ + a  1 + āreiθ )− log f ′(a)| dθ 6  ∫ 2π 0  | log f ′a(reiθ)| dθ+  +2  ∫ 2π 0  | log(1 + reiθ)| dθ.  354    Therefore, for to show that log f ′ ∈ BMOA for f from M it is enough to prove that ‖ log f ′‖H1 is bounded.  Now let us consider the first case. Let f ∈ Uα′, and let in integral representation (1.1) the function µ be a step  function, say µn. Let it satisfies (1.2) and has at most n steps. Then  log f ′(z) = −2 ∫ 2π  0  log(1− zeit) dµn(t) = −2 n∑  k=1  log(1− zeitk)ak,  where tk are the points of discontinuity of µn, ak = dµn(tk). Thus,  ‖ log f ′‖H1 6 2 n∑  k=1  |ak| · ‖ log(1− zeitk)‖H1 6  6 2( n∑  k=1  |ak|)‖ log(1 + z)‖H1 6 2α‖ log(1 + z)‖H1 .  By the above mentioned Littlewood theorem log f ′ ∈ H1. If f is an arbitrary function from Uα′ then there exists [15] a sequence of functions  fn ∈ Uα′ which tends to f uniformly in ∆ and such that the corresponding functions µ are step functions. Then f ′n(re  iθ) tends to f ′(reiθ) uniformly in [0, 2π], for every fixed r ∈ (0, 1). Therefore  ∫ 2π 0  | log f(reiθ)| dθ = lim n→∞  ∫ 2π 0  | log fn(reiθ)| dθ 6 2α‖ log(1 + z)‖H1 .  Thus, log f ′ ∈ H1. Now we consider the second case. Let f ∈ Uα∗. By (1.3) we have  log f ′(z) = log s′(z)− 2 ∫ 2π  0  log(1− ω(z)eit) dµ(t),  where ω is a Schwartz function and µ satisfies (1.4). Since s ∈ U′1, by the first part of the theorem log s′ ∈ H1. Thus, it is enough to prove that the function  ψ(z) =  ∫ 2π 0  log(1− ω(z)eit) dµ(t)  belongs to H1. Let µ be a step function with n points of discontinuity tk, k = 1, . . . , n, and dµ(tk) = ak. Then  ψ(z) = n∑  k=1  ak log(1− ω(z)eitk).  355    Thus, by the Littlewood theorem  ‖ψ‖H1 6 n∑  k=1  |ak| · ‖ log(1− ω(z)eitk)‖H1 6  6 ‖ log(1 + z)‖H1 n∑  k=1  |ak| 6 (α− 1)‖ log(1 + z)‖H1 .  Therefore, ψ ∈ H1. For arbitrary functions we get our result as in the first case.  Proof of Theorem 2. Without loss of generality we consider that ϕ is smooth. In the proof we will use the following Specht’s result [14]. For a given ∆ ∈ (0, 1) there exists a simply connected domain D with ∆ ∪ {eit : ∆π < |t| 6 π} ⊂ D such that  |ω′(z)− 1| < 1/2, z ∈ D. (2.1) Here ω denotes the conformal mapping D onto ∆ with ω(0) = 0, ω′(0) > 0, and  (1− r)/2 < 1− |ω(reit)| < 3(1− r), 0 < r < 1, |t| < δπ. (2.2)  Let q be a sufficiently big positive integer. Then for the function ϕ(x) we define a function  f(z) = ∞∑  k=1  ϕ1/2(k)ωq n  (z).  We note that f(z) = f̃(ω(z)) where f̃(z) = ∞∑  k=1  ϕ1/2(k)zq n  . The function f̃ ∈ B0 because it has Hadamard gaps and ϕ1/2(k) → 0 as k →∞ [13]. Thus, f ∈ B0 [12].  Since |ω(z)| < 1 and |ω′(z)| > 1/2 by (2.1), we have  2|f ′(z)| > ∣∣∣∣ ω(z)  ω′(z) f ′(z)  ∣∣∣∣ = ∣∣∣∣∣ ω(z)  ω′(z)  ∞∑  k=1  ϕ1/2(k)qkω′(z)ωq k−1(z)  ∣∣∣∣∣ =  =  ∣∣∣∣∣ ∞∑  k=1  ϕ 1 2 (k)qkωq  k  ∣∣∣∣∣ >  > ϕ1/2(n)qn|ω(z)|qn − n−1∑  k=1  ϕ1/2(k)qk − ∞∑  k=n+1  ϕ1/2(k)qk|ω(z)|qk .  Denote the last three expressions by E1, E2, E3, respectively. By (2.2) we have |ω(reit)| > 3r − 2 for |t| < δπ.  356    Let rn = 1−1/qn. Then for |t| < δπ and sufficiently big q such that (1−3q−n)qn > e−4 we get  E1 = ϕ 1/2(n)qn|ω(z)|qn > ϕ1/2(n)qn(1− 3q−n)qn > e−4ϕ1/2(n)qn.  To find an upper bound of E3 one can suppose that ϕ(x) is a sufficiently smooth function and ϕ(1) = 1. Since the function ϕ(t) decreases slowly and q is sufficiently big it is easy to show that the function ϕ1/2(t)qt is increasing. Indeed, assume that ϕ(t) is differentiable on (0,∞). Then we investigate a behavior of (ϕ1/2(t)qt)′. After calculations we get the inequality ϕ′(t)/ϕ(t) > − log q2. Since ϕ(t) tends to 0 slowly, we see that ϕ′(t)/ϕ(t) → 0 and the last inequality is true, because q can be sufficiently chosen.  Then  E2 = n−1∑  k=1  ϕ1/2(k)qk 6 ∫ n  1  ϕ1/2(x)qx dx. (2.3)  We will show that for a sufficiently small positive A ∫ t  1  ϕ1/2(x)qx dx 6 Aϕ1/2(t)qt, t ∈ [1,∞). (2.4)  Note that  0 =  ∫ 1 1  ϕ1/2(x)qx dx 6 Aϕ1/2(1)q.  To prove of (2.4) it sufficient to show that  ϕ1/2(t)qt 6 A [ 1  2 ϕ′(t)ϕ−1/2(t)qt + ϕ1/2(t)qt log q  ] .  Using the above investigations considerations on the behavior of ϕ′(t)/ϕ(t) we get  ϕ′(t) ϕ(t)  > 2  A − 2 log q.  Now we can control ϕ (sufficiently slowly decreasing) and q (sufficiently big) in this way that we can take A = e−4/4.  Therefore by (2.3) and (2.4)  E2 6 e−4  4 ϕ1/2(n)qn.  Girela [8] proved that for q > 2, m > s > 0 (m is an integer) and for a nonincreasing sequence (ak) of positive numbers  ∞∑ n=n+1  akq ks(1− q−n)qk 6 (me−1)man  1  qm−s − 1q ns, n = 1, 2, . . . .  357    Then by the Schwarz lemma (with ak = ϕ1/2(k) and s = 1) we get  E3 6 e−4  4 ϕ1/2(n)qn.  Finally we obtain  |f ′(z)| > e −4  4 ϕ1/2(n)qn, z = (1− q−n)eit, |t| 6 δπ.  Since n = log[1/(1− rn)]/ log q, we get  |f ′(z)| > e −4  4  1  1− rn ϕ1/2  ( log  ( 1  1− rn  ) / log q  ) >  > e−4  4  1  1− rn ϕ1/2 log  1  1− rn .  The inequality shows that there exists a constant K > 0 such that  I2(rn, f ′) > K  1  (1− rn)2 ϕ(log  1  1− rn ).  The function I2(r, f ′) is increasing with respect to r, therefore, for rn 6 r 6 rn+1 we have  I2(r, f ′) > I2(rn, f ′) > K  1  (1− rn)2 ϕ(log  1  1− rn ) =  = K 1  q2(1− rn+1)2 ϕ(log  1  1− rn ) > K  1  q2(1− r)2ϕ(log 1  1− r ).  Since all results proved for ϕ remain true for ϕ1/2, we get the proof of theorem.  Bibliography  [1] Anderson J., Clunie J., Pommerenke Ch. On Bloch functions and normal functions// J. Reine Angew.
