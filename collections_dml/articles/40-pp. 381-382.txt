   CONSTRAINED BEZIER CURVES   381   In this paper we present two new classes of n th degree Bezier   curves while its control points Ъn-1 or Ъ1 are always belong to а   curve. Degenerate Bezier curves may Ье considered as а particular   case of presented class.   А Bezier curve is а parametric curve frequently used in   computer graphics and related fields to model smooth curves that   can Ье scaled indefinitely.   As usual it is written as follows  n   ъп(t) = :Е biBf(t), (1)  i=O   where Bf(t) are Bernstein polynomials, defined explicitly Ьу   Let us consider that а curve (1) has а control point Ъn-l Е ьn(t)   for all t Е [О, lJ, then it is possiЬle to write  n '°' Ь · (n)ti(l - t)n-i = Ь L._, i i n-1,   i=O   and it follows that   Ъn-1 = l _ ntn~1(1 _ t) (t bi (7)ti(l - t)n-i + Ъntn) .  i=O     382 R . А. ZIATDINOV   Further we consider that а Bezier curve has а control point   Ь1 Е bn(t) for all t Е [О, 1), then  n   I:ьi(7)ti(l - t)n-i = Ь1 ,  i=O   n   Ьо(~)t0 (1 - t)n + Ь1 (~)t(l - t)n-l + Lbi(~)ti(l - t)n-i = Ь1,  i=2   and finally we obtain   Ь1 ~ 1 _ ntn~ '(l _ t) (t, Ь; {7)t'(l - t)n-i + bo(l - t)") .
