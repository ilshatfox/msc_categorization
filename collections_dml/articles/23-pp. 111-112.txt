)  ALTERNATIVITY AND DISJUNCTIVITY IN C∗-ALGEBRAS  Definition 1. An orthmodular poset (OMP) E is called alternative [1] if every orthogonal subset of E either has a supremum or has no minimal majorants.  Definition 2. An orthmodular poset (OMP) E is called disjunctive [3] if for any pair {a, b} in E such that a 6≤ b there is c ≤ a such that c∧ b = 0.  In the paper [2] the notions of alternativity as well as disjunctivity [3] of OMPs were studied in the context of orthoprojections or idempotents in C∗algebras. Namely, there was proved in [2] that the OMP of all idempotents in a von Neumann algebra is disjunctive but in the same time the orthomodular poset of all idempotents on a Hilbert space is not alternative. We recall that the idempotents are elements, p, of a C∗-algebra such that p2 = p, the idempotents with the property p∗ = p are projections. The sets of all idempotents or all projections are OMP’s with the order p ≤ q iff pq = qp = p and the involution p′ = e− p.  The following theorem was announced in [5] and is a generalization of [2]:  Theorem 1. The OMP of all idempotents in a von Neumann algebra M acting in a separable complex Hilbert space is alternative if and only if M is of finite type.  The proof uses some constructions of [2] and [4] as well as the existence of a center-valued trace in finite von Neumann algebras. The following theorem generalizes a result of [2]:  Theorem 2. The OMP of all idempotents in a C∗-algebra M is disjunctive if and only if the OMP of all projections in M is disjunctive.  R E F E R E N C E S 1. Ovchinnikov P. G.
