UDC 517.544.8  DIRICHLET PROBLEM SOLUTION FOR SIMPLY AND DOUBLY CONNECTED DOMAINS WITH SMOOTH BOUNDARIES  A. Elshenawy1, E.A. Shirokova2  1 atallahtm@yahoo.com; Kazan Federal University 2 elena.shirorova@kpfu.ru; Kazan Federal University  In this paper we propose a new method for solving the 2D Laplace equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions in simply and doubly connected domains. The method is based on reduction of the problem to the Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The numerical algorithm connected with truncated Fourier series is applied to convert the Fredholm equation to a finite system of linear equations.  Keywords: Cauchy integral, Fourier polynomial, Dirichlet problem, Fredholm integral equation, simply connected domain, doubly connected domain.  Here we present Cauchy integral method of 2D Dirichlet problem solution for simply and doubly connected domain with smooth boundary. The method is based on reduction of the problem to the Fredholm integral equation of the second kind for the boundary values of the conjugate harmonic function and further conversion of the integral equation to the truncated linear system. The solution of the integral equation has the form of truncated Fourier series. Finally, the solution of the Dirichlet problem has the form of the real part of the Cauchy integral.  The case of simply connected domain  We denote the function to be found as u(x, y) = ℜB(z), where B(z) is analytic in a given simply connected domain Ω. So the problem follows: given the function f0(t ) = u(x, y)|{x(t ),y(t )}∈∂Ω, t ∈ [0,2π], while the boundary smooth curve ∂Ω of the domain Ω passing in a counterclockwise direction, it is necessary to find the function u(x, y), (x, y) ∈Ω.  By denoting g0(t )=ℑB(z(t ))|z(t )=x(t )+i y(t )∈∂Ω, t ∈ [0,2π], and separating the imaginary parts in both the sides of the criterion of the function f0(t )+ i g0(t ) to be the boundary values of the function analytic in Ω, as in [2], the following Fredholm integral equation of the second kind is obtained:  g0(t ) =− 1  π  ˆ 2π 0  f0(τ) ( log[z(τ)− z(t )]  )′ τ  dτ+ 1 π  ˆ 2π 0  g0(τ) ( arg[z(τ)− z(t )]  )′ τ  dτ. (1)    A. Elshenawy, E.A. Shirokova 13  The integral equation (1) is similar to that appeared in [4] when the problem was solved applying the potential theory. The factor (eiτ−ei t ) is extracted from the expression (z(τ)− z(t )) in order to separate the improper VP integral in the Fredholm equation.  The solution is obtained in the form of truncated Fourier series g0(t ) = α0 +∑∞ n=1αn cos(nt )+βn sin(nt ) by solving the following linear system:(  A A AB B A BB  )( α  β  ) =  ( p q  ) (2)  according to the following Lemma. [1] Let numbers j , p > 1 and a constantU > 0 exist such that |∂ j+pG(τ, t )/∂t j∂τp | ≤ U and the function Y (t ) possess the bounded second derivative: Y ′′(t ) < T . Then, the approximate solution of the uniquely resolvable Fredholm integral equation of the second kind  X (t ) = ˆ 2π  0 G(τ, t )X (τ)dτ+Y (t ),  where Y (t ) is 2π periodic and G(τ, t ) is 2π periodic with respect to both variables, can be reduced to solution of finite linear system with error estimated by O  ( 1/N 2  ) where N is the  system rank. After finding g0(t ) we restore the Dirichlet problem solution as  u(x, y) =ℜ 1 2πi  2πˆ  0  f0(t )+ i g0(t ) z(t )−x − i y z  ′(t )d t .  The case of doubly connected domain  For the case of doubly connected domain Ω with boundary ∂Ω, we assume that the boundary is composed of the outer smooth curve L0 : z0(t ), t ∈ [0,2π], passed in counterclockwise direction and the inner smooth curve L1 : z1(t ), t ∈ [0,2π], passed in clockwise direction. The Dirichlet problem follows: given the functions f j (t ), j = 0,1, it is necessary to find u(x, y), (x, y) ∈ Ω, such that f j (t ) = u(x, y)|{x(t ),y(t )}∈L j , j = 0,1, t ∈ [0,2π]. Assume that the solution of the Dirichlet problem, according to [2], is presented in the form u(x, y) =ℜB(z)+ A log |z|, z = x + i y, where A is a real-valued parameter which will be calculated later. So we have the boundary values of the analytic function B(z) represented in the parametric form as follows:  B(z(t ))|∂Ω =    f0(t )− A log |z0(t )|+ i g0(t ), z(t) ∈ L0,  f1(t )− A log |z1(t )|+ i g1(t ), z(t) ∈ L1. (3)  Here {  g j (t ) }1  j=0 =ℑB(z(t ))|z(t )=x(t )+i y(t )∈L j , t ∈ [0,2π]. By separating the imaginary parts of the corresponding integral equation as above, the following system of Fredholm inte   14 МАТЕРИАЛЫ МЕЖДУНАРОДНОЙ ШКОЛЫ-КОНФЕРЕНЦИИ  gral equations is obtained:  g0(t ) = 1  π  ˆ 2π 0  g0(τ) [ arg(z0(τ)− z0(t ))  ]′ τ  dτ+ 1 π  ˆ 2π 0  g1(τ) [ arg(z1(τ)− z0(t ))  ]′ τ  dτ  − 1 π  ˆ 2π 0  ( f0(τ)− A log |z0(τ)|  )[ log(z0(τ)− z0(t ))  ]′ τ  dτ  − 1 π  ˆ 2π 0  ( f1(τ)− A log |z1(τ)|  )[ log(z1(τ)− z0(t ))  ]′ τ  dτ (4)  g1(t ) = 1  π  ˆ 2π 0  g0(τ) [ arg(z0(τ)− z1(t ))  ]′ τ  dτ+ 1 π  ˆ 2π 0  g1(τ) [ arg(z1(τ)− z1(t ))  ]′ τ  dτ  − 1 π  ˆ 2π 0  ( f0(τ)− A log |z0(τ)|  )[ log(z0(τ)− z1(t ))  ]′ τ  dτ  − 1 π  ˆ 2π 0  ( f1(τ)− A log |z1(τ)|  )[ log(z1(τ)− z1(t ))  ]′ τ  dτ (5)  The solution of the system with truncated Fourier series is obtained as a linear function of the constant A. Due to the properties of Cauchy integral, the parameter A can be easily calculated from the following formula:  1∑ s=0  (ˆ 2π 0  [ fs(t )− A log |zs(t )|+ i gs(t )  ] źs(t ) zk+1s (t )  d t  ) = 0, k = 0,1, . . . (6)  Finally, the Dirichlet problem solution u(x, y) in the doubly connected domain Ω as a function of z = (x + i y) can be expressed in the form  u(z) =ℜ (  1∑ j=0  1  2πi  ˆ 2π 0  f j (t )− A log |z j (t )|+ i g j (t ) z j (t )− z  ź j (t )d t  ) + A  2 log  ( x2 + y2  ) (7)  The Cauchy integral method, applied to several examples, gave highly accurate results for irregular simply and doubly connected domains, it is also applicable for the domains with boundary components that are not star-like with respect to the origin [3], as presented in figure (1), for harmonic function with constant boundary values.
