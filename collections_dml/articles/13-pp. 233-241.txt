.  FREDHOLM PROPERTY OF THE STRONGLY SINGULAR INTEGRAL OPERATOR FOR AN  INHOMOGENEOUS OPTICAL FIBER  E.M. Kartchevski Kazan State University  The eigenvalue problem for generalized natural modes of an inhomogeneous optical fiber is formulated as a problem for the set of time-harmonic Maxwell’s equations with the SveshnikovReichardt condition at infinity in the cross sectional plane. The eigenvalues of this problem are the complex propagation constants on a logarithmic Riemann surface. The original problem is reduced to a strongly singular domain integral equation, which is often used in practice for computation, and it is proved that the operator of the domain integral equation is a Fredholm operator with zero index.  233    Fredholm property of the strongly singular integral operator. . .  1 Introduction  Optical fibers are dielectric waveguides having various cross-sectional shapes, and where generally the refractive index of the dielectric may vary in the waveguide’s cross-section. In recent years research on the natural modes of arbitrarily-shaped dielectric waveguides has been focused on the development of efficient and reliable computational methods. In many papers on numerical methods for dielectric waveguides, the mathematical grounding of the method was frequently neglected, however, useful insight into the encountered difficulties and modal behavior has been discussed (e. g., [1], [2]). The most rigorous efforts were connected with integral equation (IE) formulations. Within this class the domain IE method has the attractive advantage of being applicable to cross-sectionally inhomogeneous dielectric waveguides [3], [4]. A problem with domain IE’s is that they are strongly-singular, which previously prevented their use in a mathematical study of the spectrum of the eigenvalues, with the exception of [5] for the purely guided-modes of an inhomogeneous dielectric waveguide. For real-valued propagation constants it was proved in [5] that the operator of the domain IE is semi-Fredholm.  In this paper we formulate the modal eigenvalue problem as a problem for the set of time-harmonic Maxwell’s equations with the Reichardt condition at infinity in the cross sectional plane. The eigenvalues of this problem are the complex propagation constants of the natural modes. The original problem is reduced to a strongly singular domain integral equation similar to [3], [4], [5]. We prove that the operator of the domain integral equation is a Fredholm operator with zero index.  2 Statement of the problem  We consider the generalized natural modes of the regular dielectric waveguide. Let the three-dimensional space {(x1, x2, x3) : −∞ < x1, x2, x3 < ∞} be occupied by an isotropic source-free medium, and let the refractive index be prescribed as a real-valued function n = n(x1, x2) independent of the longitudinal coordinate x3, and equal to a positive constant n∞ outside a cylinder. The axis of the cylinder is parallel to the x3-axis, and its cross section is a bounded  234    E.M. Kartchevski  domain Ω on the plane IR2 = {(x1, x2) : −∞ < x1, x2 <∞}. Denote by Ω∞ the unbounded domain Ω∞ = IR  2 \ Ω. Let the function n belong to the space of continuous functions in IR2.  The modal problem can be formulated as a vector eigenvalue problem for the set of harmonic Maxwell’s equations assuming that electric and magnetic field vectors have the form  E(x, x3, t) = Re (E(x) exp (iβx3 − iωt)) , (2.1) H(x, x3, t) = Re (H(x) exp (iβx3 − iωt)) . (2.2)  Here x = (x1, x2), ω > 0 is the radian frequency, β is the complexvalued modal wavenumber (or propagation constant), and E and H are complex amplitudes of E and H.  For the fields of the form (2.1), (2.2), the set of Maxwell’s equations become  RotβE = iωµ0H, x ∈ IR2, (2.3) RotβH = −iωε0n2E, x ∈ IR2. (2.4)  Here ε0, µ0 are the free-space dielectric and magnetic constants, respectively, and  RotβE =     ∂E3/∂x2 − iβE2 iβE1 − ∂E3/∂x1  ∂E2/∂x1 − ∂E1/∂x2    . (2.5)  By C2(IR2) denote the space of twice continuously differentiable in IR2 complex-valued functions. We shall be seeking non-zero solutions  [E,H] of set (2.3), (2.4) in the space ( C2(IR2)  )6 .  Denote by ΩR a circle ΩR = { x ∈ IR2 : |x| ≤ R  } , and by ΓR the  boundary of ΩR.  Definition 2.1. Let R0 be a large positive constant such that Ω ⊂ ΩR0 . We say that functions E and H satisfy the SveshnikovReichardt condition if the functions E and H can be represented for all x ∈ IR2 \ ΩR0 as  [ E H  ] =  ∞∑  l=−∞  [ Al Bl  ] H  (1) l (χr) exp (ilϕ) , (2.6)  235    Fredholm property of the strongly singular integral operator. . .  where H (1) l is the Hankel function of the first kind and index l, (r, ϕ)  are the polar coordinates of the point x, and χ = √ k2n2∞ − β2. The  series in (2.6) should converge uniformly and absolutely.  Definition 2.2. By Λ denote the Riemann surface of the function  lnχ(β). A nonzero vector [E,H] ∈ ( C2(IR2)  )6 is referred to as a  generalized eigenvector (or eigenmode) of the problem (2.3), (2.4), and (2.6) corresponding to an eigenvalue β ∈ Λ if the relations of problem (2.3), (2.4), and (2.6) are valid.  3 Fredholm property of a strongly singular  domain integral operator  Now we reduce problem (2.3), (2.4), and (2.6) to a nonlinear spectral problem for a strongly singular domain integral equation similar to [3], [4], [5], which is often used in practice due to its ability to account for generally inhomogeneous media.  For all β ∈ Λ we have  E(x) = ( k2n2∞ +GradβDivβ  ) 1 n2∞  ∫  Ω  ( n2(y)− n2∞  ) Φ(β;x, y)E(y)dy,  (3.1)  Φ (β;x, y) = i  4 H  (1) 0 (χ(β) |x− y|) , x ∈ IR2, y ∈ Ω.  This result is well known for β ∈ G (see, e. g., [6]). The desired assertion for all β ∈ Λ is obtained by applying the method of Green functions to the vector Helmholtz equation for the electric field with the use of the relation ∫  ΓR  ( ∂E(y)  ∂|y| Φ(β;x, y)− ∂Φ(β;x, y)  ∂|y| E(y)dy )  = 0, R ≥ R0, (3.2)  which is valid for any β ∈ Λ and an arbitrary function E satisfying the Reichardt condition (2.6).  Lemma 3.1. Suppose [E,H] is an eigenvector of problem (2.3), (2.4), and (2.6) corresponding to an eigenvalue β ∈ Λ. Then  (Q(β)E) (x) = 0, x ∈ IR2, (3.3)  236    E.M. Kartchevski  where  (Q(β)E) (x) = E(x) + 1 2 η(x)E(x) (3.4)  − ∫  Ω  T (β;x, y)  (( n2(y)  n2∞ − 1 ) E(y)  ) dy  −v.p. ∫  Ω  T1 (x, y)  (( n2(y)  n2∞ − 1 ) E(y)  ) dy,  TF =    KF  iβF3∂Φ/∂x1 iβF3∂Φ/∂x2  iβF1∂Φ/∂x1 iβF2∂Φ/∂x2 ( k2n2∞ − β2  ) F3Φ    ,  (3.5)  T1F =    K1F  0 0  0 0 0    , (3.6)  η(x) =     n2(x)Án2∞ − 1 0 0 0 n2(x)Án2∞ − 1 0 0 0 0    , (3.7)  K(β;x, y)F(y) = k2n2∞F(y)Φ(β;x, y)  + (F(y), grad2) grad2Φ0(β;x, y), (3.8)  K1(x, y)F(y) = (F(y), grad2) grad2Φ1(x, y), (3.9)  Φ1(x, y) = − 1  2π ln |x− y| , Φ0(β;x, y) = Φ(β;x, y)− Φ1(x, y).  (3.10)  The assertion of the Lemma we obtain by direct calculations passing the operator GradβDivβ under the integral in relation (3.1), and using the differention rule [7, p. 242] for weakly singular integrals.  For all β ∈ Λ the operatorQ(β) that is determined by (3.3) will be considered as an operator in the space of complex-valued functions [L2(Ω)]  3. For all β ∈ Λ the operator Q(β) has a highly singular kernel, but it will follow from the analysis that the operator Q(β) is Fredholm with zero index for all β ∈ Λ.  237    Fredholm property of the strongly singular integral operator. . .  Theorem 3.1. For all β ∈ Λ the operator Q(β) is Fredholm with zero index.  Proof. Let β be a fixed number that belongs to Λ. By Q∗(β) denote the operator adjoint to Q(β). By direct calculation for x ∈ Ω we obtain  (Q∗(β)E) (x) = ( I +  1  2 η(x)  ) E(x) (3.11)  − ( n2(x)  n2∞ − 1 )∫  Ω  T p (β;x, y) E(y)dy  − ( n2(x)  n2∞ − 1 ) v.p.  ∫  Ω  T1 (x, y) E(y)dy,  where  T p F =     KF iβF1∂Φ/∂x1 iβF2∂Φ/∂x2  iβF3∂Φ/∂x1 iβF3∂Φ/∂x2 ( k2n2  ∞ − β2  ) F3Φ    . (3.12)  Note that the kernel T1(x, y) is highly singular, self-adjoint, and does not depend in β; the kernels T (β;x, y) , T p (β;x, y) are weakly polar for any β ∈ Λ.  Now we shall prove that operator Q(β) is Fredholm with zero index. We will use the general results of the theory of multidimensional singular matrix operators [7, p. 368]. By definition, put  (D(β)E) (x) = ( I +  1  2 η(x)  ) E(x) (3.13)  −p(x) ∫  IR2  T (β;x, y)  (( n2(y)  n2∞ − 1 ) E(y)  ) dy  −v.p. ∫  IR2  T1 (x, y)  (( n2(y)  n2∞ − 1 ) E(y)  ) dy,  where x ∈ IR2 and p(x) is a indefinitely differentiable real-valued function which has compact support in IR2, and is equal to 1 for  238    E.M. Kartchevski  x ∈ Ω. For all β ∈ Λ the operator D(β) will be considered as an operator in the space of complex-valued functions [L2(IR  2)]3. By direct calculations for x ∈ IR2 we have  (D∗(β)E) (x) = ( I +  1  2 η(x)  ) E(x) (3.14)  − ( n2(x)  n2∞ − 1 ) ∫  IR2  p(y)T p (β;x, y) E(y)dy  − ( n2(x)  n2∞ − 1 ) v.p.  ∫  IR2  T1 (x, y) E(y)dy.  The first integral operators in (3.13) and (3.14) are compact in [L2(IR 2)]3  for all β ∈ Λ. Denote them by C(β) and C∗(β), respectively. For x ∈ IR2 if we define  (SE) (x) = ( I +  1  2 η(x)  ) E(x) (3.15)  −v.p. ∫  IR2  T1 (x, y)  (( n2(y)  n2∞ − 1 ) E(y)  ) dy,  then  (S∗E) (x) = ( I +  1  2 η(x)  ) E(x) (3.16)  − ( n2(x)  n2∞ − 1 ) v.p.  ∫  IR2  T1 (x, y) E(y)dy,  D(β) = C(β) + S, D∗(β) = C∗(β) + S∗. By direct calculations, for x ∈ IR2 and l,m = 1, 2, we have  ( S∗l,mEm  ) (x) =  ( 1 +  1  2  ( n2(x)  n2∞ − 1 ))  δl,mEm(x) (3.17)  − ( n2(x)  n2∞ − 1 ) v.p.  ∫  IR2  (2αl(ϕ)αm(ϕ)− δl,n) Em(y)  2π |x− y|2 dy,  239    Fredholm property of the strongly singular integral operator. . .  ( S∗3,3E3  ) (x) = E3(x),  ( S∗l,3E3  ) (x) = 0,  ( S∗3,mEn  ) (x) = 0,  where δl,m is the Kronecker symbol and αl(ϕ) and αm(ϕ) are the Cartesian coordinates of point α = (y − x) / |x− y| ,  αm(ϕ) = cosϕ, αm(ϕ) = sinϕ. (3.18)  The function n is continuous in IR2 and n(x) = n∞ for x ∈ IR2ÂΩ. Therefore, the characteristics of the operators S∗l,n are continuous in IR2 and do not depend on x for x ∈ IR2ÂΩ. Hence, by direct calculations we have an exact representation [7, p. 368] of the symbol matrix Ψ∗(x, α) of the operator S∗  Ψ ∗  (x, α) =     1 + (  n2(x)  n2∞ − 1  ) α21(ϕ)  ( n2(x)  n2∞ − 1  ) α1(ϕ)α2(ϕ) 0(  n2(x)  n2∞ − 1  ) α1(ϕ)α2(ϕ) 1 +  ( n2(x)  n2∞ − 1  ) α22(ϕ) 0  0 0 1     (3.19)  for x ∈ IR2, α ∈ Γ1. The function n is real, so the symbol matrix Ψ(x, α) of the singular integral operator S is equal to Ψ∗(x, α),  Ψ(x, α) = Ψ∗(x, α), x ∈ IR2, α ∈ Γ1. (3.20)  The following conditions are evidently valid:  inf x∈IR2, α∈Γ1  |detΨ(x, α)| > 0,  inf x∈IR2, α∈Γ1  ∣∣∣∣det (  Ψ1,1(x, α) Ψ1,2(x, α) Ψ2,1(x, α) Ψ2,2(x, α)  )∣∣∣∣ > 0, (3.21)  inf x∈IR2, α∈Γ1  |Ψ1,1(x, α)| > 0,  Therefore [7, pp. 362, 379] the operator D(β) is Fredholm with zero index. By analogy with Lemma 8.1 [8] it is easy to prove that index of the operator Q(β) is equal to index of the operator D(β), and also if the operator D(β) is normally solvable, then the operator Q(β) is normally solvable. This completes the proof.  240    E.M. Kartchevski  References  [1] Voitovich N.N., Katsenelenbaum B.Z., Sivov A.N., Shatrov A.D.
