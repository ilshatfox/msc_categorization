 THE FERMAT–EULER THEOREM AND DYNAMICAL PROPERTIES OF P -ADIC SOLENOIDS  As is well known, the theorems formulated below play an important role in the congruence theory (see, e.g., [1]).  Fermat’s Theorem. If a positive integer k is not divisible by a prime p, then kp−1 ≡ 1 (mod p).  In 1760 L. Euler generalized this theorem to the following form.  Euler’s Theorem. Let k and m be relatively prime positive integers. Then kϕ(m) ≡ 1 (mod m).  Here ϕ(m) is the value of the Euler function at m, that is, the number of positive integers which are relatively prime to m and at most m.  In [2] P. Fermat’s theorem is applied to the study of properties of periodic points of limit mappings of the dyadic solenoid.  Let P = ( p1, p2, . . .) be an arbitrary sequence of prime numbers (1 not being included as a prime). The P -adic solenoid ΣP is the inverse limit  of the inverse sequence S1 f21←− S1 f  3 2←− S1 f  4 3←− . . . , where S1 is the unit  circle considered as a subspace of the field of all complex numbers endowed with the natural topology. For every integer n the bonding mapping fn+1n is given by fn+1n (z) = z  pn for each z ∈ S1. If pn = 2 for all integers n, then the solenoid ΣP is said to be dyadic. Recall that the solenoid ΣP is a compact abelian group under the coordinatewise multiplication.  For positive integer k, let the morphism hk∞ : ΣP → ΣP be defined by hk∞(g) = g  k, where g ∈ ΣP . A point g ∈ ΣP is said to be periodic if g is a fixed point of the n-th iteration of hk∞ for some positive integer n.  Using L. Euler’s theorem, one can prove (cf. [3; Proposition 6])  Proposition. Suppose that infinitely many primes are not terms of the sequence P . Then the set of all periodic points of hk∞ is dense in ΣP .  R E F E R E N C E S 1. Vinogradov I. M.

Ghadiri (Yazd, Iran, mghadiri@yazduni.ac.ir)  ON DIRECT LIMITS OF Hv-MODULES  In this paper, the category of Hv-modules is considered. Also, it is shown that the direct limit of every direct system always exist in this category. Direct limit are defined by a universal property, and so are unique. The most powerful tool in order to obtain a module from a given Hv-module is the quotient out procedure. By use this method, some results about the connection between the fundamental modules, direct systems and direct limits is proved by considering the fundamental equivalence relation ε∗.  B. Solon (Ivanovo, Russia, solon@icti.ivanovo.su)  QUASI-MINIMALITY IS A SYNONYM OF THE NON-TOTALITY OF ENUMERATION DEGREE  We use notations and terminology similar to those of the monograph [1]. We recall as [2] that A ≤e B (A is enumeration reducible to B), if there is a uniform algorithm for enumerating A given any enumeration of B. Formally,  A ≤e B ⇐⇒ (∃n)(∀x)[x ∈ A ⇐⇒ (∃u)[〈x, u〉 ∈ Wn ∧Du ⊆ B]].  Let as usual A ≡e B ⇐⇒ A ≤e B ∧ B ≤e A and de(A) = {B : B ≡e A} be e-degree of A and de(A) ≤ de(B) ⇐⇒ A ≤e B. Denote by De the set of e-degrees partially ordered by ≤ and by 0e the least element of De .  An e-degree a is called non-total if in it there are no total functions (which are identified with their graphs). Let Tot be the set of all total e-degrees. The first example of a non-total e-degree has given by Medvedev [3]. The Medvedev’s e-degrees were named by Case [4] quasi-minimal later: a is quasiminimal iff  0e < a ∧ (∀f ∈ Tot)[f ≤ a → f = 0e].  75
