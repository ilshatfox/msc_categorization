In particular, we obtain pointwise Berstein-Walsh-type estimation for algebraic polynomials in the bounded and unbounded regions with piecewise smooth and quasi-smooth boundary having exterior and interior zero angles at the finite number boundary of points.  Keywords: algebraic polynomials, weighted Lebesgue space, Berstein-Walsh-type estimation.  UDC 517  APPROXIMATION INEQUALITIES IN WEIGHTED ORLICZ SPACES  R. Akgün1  1 rakgun@balikesir.edu.tr; Balıkesir  In this work some Jackson-Stechkin type direct theorems of trigonometric approximation are proved in Orlicz spaces, generated by a quasiconvex function, with weights satisfying some Muckenhoupt’s Ap condition. To obtain a refined version of the Jackson type inequality we prove an extrapolation theorem, Marcinkiewicz multiplier theorem and Littlewood-Paley type results. By means of a realization result we find an equivalence between the fractional order weighted modulus of smoothness and the classical weighted Peetre’s K-functional.  Keywords: approximation inequalities, Orlicz spaces.  References  1. Akgün R. Approximating polynomials for functions of weighted Smirnov-Orlicz spaces // J. Funct.
