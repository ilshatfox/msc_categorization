 FINITE GROUPS AND THE FACTORIZATION OF FORMATIONS  1. Finite groups with given sylow normalizers  We denote by NX the class of finite groups in which the normalizers of all Sylow subgroups belong to X . In [1], Bianchi, Mauri and Hauck proved that NN ⊆ N for the class of all finite nilpotent groups, i,e, if the normalizers of all Sylow subgroups of a group G is nilpotent, then G is nilpotent. In [2], Fedri and Serena pointed out that NU 6⊆ U for the class of all finite supersoluber groups. In [3-4], W. Guo gave a criterion whether a group G belongs to a Shemetkov formation F when all Sylow normalizers of G belong to F , and gave a series of applications.  In [5], Kondrat’ev A.S. proved that a group G is 2-nilpotent if the normalizer of each Sylow subgroup of G is of odd index in G. In [6], Zhang J. proved that a group G is soluble if the index of the normalizer of any Sylow subgroup of G is a prime power. In [7], Naoki Chigira proved that a group G is p-nipotent if p 6= 3 and (|G : NG(Gr)|, p) = 1 for every r ∈ π(G). In [8], W.Guo proved that the index of the normalizer of any Sylow subgroup of a group G is an odd number or a prime power if and only if G is a soluble group and G = KH, where K and H are Hall subgroups of G,K is a nilpotent subgroup which is normal in a 2′-Hall subgroup of G and H is 2-nilpotent.  2. Sylow objects in formations and the factorizations of formations  Problem 1 (Vedernikov). Describe the local formation in which every local subformation is complemented.  Problem 2 (Skiba). Describe the soluble totally local formation F satisfing the lattice F/∞(F∩N ) of all total locally formations between F∩N and F is Boolean (or a complemented lattice).  Problem 3 (Kourovka Notebook, problem 12.74). If F = MH is a one-generated composition formation,where M and H are nontrivial formations, is M a composition formation?  Problem 4 (Skiba). Is it possible to describe all uncancellative factorizations of the one-generated Baer-local formations?  26    Problem 5 (Shemetkov). Let F1F2 · · · Ft = M1M2 · · ·Mn, where F1,F2, · · · ,Ft, M1,M2, · · ·Mn are s-indecomposable s-closed w-saturated formations. Is it true that n = t and Fi = Mi, for all i = 1, 2, · · · , t ?  We have resolved the above Problems (cf [9–13]).  R E F E R E N C E S 1.
