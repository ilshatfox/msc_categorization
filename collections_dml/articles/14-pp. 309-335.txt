 NON-NEWTONIAN FLUIDS WITH JUMP DISCONTINUITIES  Аннотация  Different types of models describing the spreading of a fluid film with an initial surface jump and leading to discontinuous solutions are considered. Using the symmetry properties of these models, solutions describing the following situations are found: spreading of a film over a flat horizontal surface, flow from an inclined surface onto a horizontal plane, flow over a step-like surface, and spreading of a film subject to local mass sources. All determined discontinuous solutions are illustrated by graphs obtained by numerical calculations. Their physical interpretation is given for the case that the film forms part of an ice sheet or glacier.  1 Introduction  The motion of thin films, whose longitudinal dimension is much larger than the transversal extent, is a classical field of study of fluid dynamics in a variety of applications. For example, for sufficiently large time scales, all existing ice sheets and glaciers can be considered as thin layers of a non-linear viscous fluid (Shumskii 1969, Fowler and Larson 1978, Hutter 1983, Salamatin and Mazo 1984). Moreover,  315    many modern technological applications make in one form or another use of flows of thin films of non-Newtonian fluids. In these, under certain conditions, surface tension can play an important role. However, if the gravity force is much larger than the force, caused by surface tension (large Bond numbers), then surface tension can be ignored (Hocking 1980). Therefore, for the purpose of this work, let us consider only situations when this condition is satisfied, that is we will assume that surface tension is negligible.  Many physical processes associated with film flows are described by sharp changes of their main characteristics – fluid thickness and mass flux in some small regions. For example, the layer thickness experiences a jump when the fluid flows over a surface with a step; moreover, a change of the slip-law leads to a sharp change of the upper surface slope. A situation, giving rise to a sharp change of the horizontal mass flux, is the existence of strong mass sources or sinks on the surfaces and inside the film acting in regions much smaller than the typical longitudinal scales. Such a situation may arise e.g. when a glacier suddenly and locally receives accumulated mass from an ice fall of a hanging glacier above it.  For the description of the above situations, it is natural to consider models which allow solutions in which a field variable or its space or time derivative may experience a jump discontinuity. One example with such solutions is well known (Fowler 1984) and deals with the reduction of the mathematical model describing the propagation of surface waves to a nonlinear first-order partial differential equation. From a mathematical point of view, solutions with jumps are natural for hyperbolic equations, and their existence is evident. The situation is different when more complex models, described by parabolic equations, are considered. In this case, the existence of a solution with jumps is not evident. So it should be no surprise that in an extensive list of works studied by us, such solutions were not considered.  Because the number of models of film flows admitting solutions with jumps is far too large, let us restrict attention to models describing the “diffusive” spreading of a film, which starts initially with a jump in its surface elevation. This choice is motivated by the following reasoning. First, one particular model demonstrates that, if the boundary conditions are regular, then the solution is smooth, even for an initially discontinuous surface elevation; second, such models describe possible realistic situations, and third, they possess certain symmetries allowing a qualitative analysis.  A model or a system is said to admit a symmetry, if its equations remain invariant with regard to a certain group of transformations (Ovsyannikov 1969, Olver 1986, Stephani 1989, Ibragimov 2000). Every invariance group of transformations is generated by a corresponding operator, called infinitesimal operator, which one is actually searching for. For the equation, describing the dynamics of the free surface of a fluid film obeying a power law stress-stretching relation, all possible symmetries  316    were found by Chugunov (1982), and one of them is described by the infinitesimal operator  X̂ = (n + 1)t ∂  ∂t + x  ∂  ∂x . (1)  It is the appropriate operator for the spreading of a film with initial step-like profile over a flat horizontal plane without slip (Chugunov 1995).  This discussion suggests to us to formulate the aim of this work as follows: to consider models admitting the symmetry (1), in order to show existence of solutions with jumps and to discuss their physical interpretation. To this end, we shall in the second section discuss the governing dynamical equations of the film surface for a number of different situations of the film motion, when its initial surface elevation has a jump. Moreover, it will be shown that all these models are based on the equation describing the spreading of the film over a flat solid surface without slip; this equation can be converted to an ordinary differential equation of second-order. For this conversion, the existence of the symmetry (1) is essential.  In the third section, we then study the qualitative behavior of the solutions of the derived ordinary differential equation. Such an analysis is possible, because the considered equation again possesses symmetry, allowing transformation to a firstorder differential equation. Two propositions are formulated, which allow us to find solutions with jumps and to study their qualitative behavior. In the fourth section, we consider realistic examples of models allowing solutions with jumps. Firstly, the problem of the spreading of a film without slip but with an initial step-like profile is considered. The basal boundary is flat and horizontal. It is shown that the solution of the problem is smooth. Singularities caused by the non-linearity are also discussed. Then, this model is generalized for the transition flow from an inclined plane to a flat horizontal plane; the jump of the film thickness is studied as is the reaction of the film to a step in the basal profile and the existence of sources or sinks. Different types of solutions of these problems with jumps are shown. The conclusions regarding the qualitative behavior of the solutions are illustrated by numerical computations using well established algorithms. The physical interpretation of the derived results is discussed. Because the interests of the authors are mostly associated with ice sheet dynamics, the physical interpretation is given with reference to the ice sheet motion, which, of course, does not restrict the generality of the results.  2 Formulation  The mathematical model of the slow spreading of a film over a rigid surface is wellknown. In the isothermal case it consists of the equation of conservation of mass and the Stokes equations, accounting for a small value of the Reynolds number, and closed by the nonlinear power flow-law. These equations are completed by a  317    sliding law at the basal surface as well as by boundary conditions of stress at all surfaces (Fowler and Larson 1978, Hutter 1983). Small value of the film-aspect ratio allows us to simplify the original system of equations and to express all the flow characteristics in terms of the upper surface elevation, which is determined from a nonlinear parabolic evolution equation (Salamatin and Mazo 1984). For the powerlaw rheology this equation, written in dimensionless variables, takes the form  ∂`  ∂t =  ∂  ∂x  `∫  zb  Udz + ∂  ∂y  `∫  zb  V dz = S(x, y, t), (2)  V = Vs − (∇`/||∇`||)||∇`||n[(`− z)n+1 −Hn+1]/(n + 1), (3) where V is the two dimensional velocity vector with components U, V ; Vs is the sliding velocity vector with components Us, Vs; `,H = `−zb are the surface elevation and the thickness of the film; moreover, S is the accumulation rate; t the time; x, y the horizontal spatial coordinates and z the vertical spatial coordinate; ∇ = ( ∂  ∂x , ∂  ∂y )  is the gradient operator; ||.|| the norm of a vector; zb the surface elevation of the base and n the flow index3. It should be noticed, that, if n is replaced by 1/n in the power law, then the Ostwald-de Waele power-law model is obtained.  We will denote scales for the length and thickness of the film by x0, h0 and for the vertical velocity by w0. The following relations among the dimensionless and dimensional quantities can then be written (Salamatin, Mazo 1984)  x = X  x0 , y =  Y  x0 , z =  Z  h0 , t =  τw0 h0  ,  U = uh0 x0w0  , V = vh0 x0w0  , Us = ush0 x0w0  , Vs = vsh0 x0w0  ,  S = s  w0 , ` =  h  h0 , zb =  Zb h0  .  Here, X, Y , Z,τ , u, v, us, vs, s, h, Z0 are the dimensional spatial coordinates, time, velocity components, sliding velocity components, accumulation rate, surface elevation of the film and basal surface elevation, respectively. For a film flow along a flow band of constant width or simply for plane flow, from (2), (3), on assuming a small aspect ratio, h0/x0 << 1, we can derive  ∂H  ∂t +  ∂Q  ∂x = S(x, t), (4)  Q = UsH − sign (  ∂H  ∂x  ) Hn+2  n + 2  ∣∣∣∣ ∂H  ∂x +  ∂zb ∂x  ∣∣∣∣ n  , (5)  3n > 1 for shear-thinning or pseudo-plastic-fluids and 0 < n < 1 for shear-thickening or dilatant fluid, for example, mud (2, 5 < n < 10), oil (n = 1.25), ice (n = 3), represent pseudo-plastic liquids, and lime-water mixture (n = 2/3) is a dilatant liquid  318    U = Us − sign (  ∂H  ∂x  ) ∣∣∣∣ ∂H  ∂x +  ∂zb ∂x  ∣∣∣∣ n  (`− z)n+1 −Hn+1 n + 1  , (6)  where Q is the horizontal mass flux per unit width. Equation (4) is the z integrated mass balance, (6) defines the stream-wise velocity profile (from an integration of the momentum equation) and (5) is the volume flux associated with the velocity (6). The transverse velocity W is found from the equation of conservation of mass  W = − z∫  z0  ∂U  ∂x . (7)  Equations (4), (5), together with a sliding law, constitute a closed system of equations for the film thickness H(x, t). Boundary and initial conditions for equations (4), (5) and the definition of the functions S(x, t), zb(x) specify the class of flow under consideration.  Generally, if at a certain point x = x∗ the film thickness has a jump, then, from the mass balance, the jumps of the functions H(x, t) and Q(x, t) must obey the relation  x′∗[[H]]− [[Q]] = 0, (8) where the symbol ′ denotes differentiation with respect to t, [[H]] = H(x∗ − 0, t) − H(x∗ + 0) and [[Q]] = Q(x∗ − 0, t)−Q(x∗ + 0, t).  In the subsequent analysis, we will assume the no-slip condition. Moreover, we will omit the factor 1/(n+2), which can be achieved by the substitution t̃ = t/(n+ 2), Q̃ = (n + 2)Q, S̃ = (n + 2)S.  Let us consider the situation, when the film thickness initially has a jump at the point x = 0 (see Fig. 1a). This sharp change of the film thickness must obviously cause a conspicuous mass flux in the vicinity of this point; the film surface starts moving, even if the solid surface is a horizontal plane and there is no surface accumulation. The dynamics of the film surface is described in this case by the model (tildes to characterize the transformed variables are henceforth omitted)  ∂H  ∂t +  ∂Q  ∂x = 0, −∞ < x < ∞, t > 0; (9)  Q = −sign (  ∂H  ∂x  ) Hn+2  ∣∣∣∣ ∂H  ∂x  ∣∣∣∣ n  , (10)  t = 0 : H = H−∞, x < 0; H = H + ∞, x > 0; (11)  x → ±∞, H → H±∞. (12)  Let us also complicate the problem by considering the situation when the film, spreading over an inclined base, reaches a horizontal flat surface (Fig. 1b). In this  319    case, there is a sharp change of the solid surface slope, a case typical for mountain glaciers (for example, Kozelski Glacier (Chugunov 1995)). The mathematical model takes in this case the form  ∂H  ∂t +  ∂Q  ∂x = 0, Q = −sign  ( ∂H  ∂x  ) Hn+2  ∣∣∣∣ ∂H  ∂x − ε  ∣∣∣∣ n  , x < 0, t > 0; (13)  ∂H  ∂t +  ∂Q  ∂x = 0, Q = −sign  ( ∂H  ∂x  ) Hn+2  ∣∣∣∣ ∂H  ∂x  ∣∣∣∣ n  , x > 0, t > 0; (14)  The initial and boundary conditions shall be given by (11), (12), but with H+∞ = 0. As ε → 0, the model coincides with the previous one (9) – (12). The point x = 0 determines the position of the possible jump. Therefore, from (8) since x  ′ ∗ = 0  continuity of the mass flux Q follows immediately. In the general case, the jump of the film thickness, which determines the jump of the mass flux, can be imposed arbitrarily, but in the situation under consideration we request that  x = 0 : [[H]] = 0, [[Q]] = 0 (15)  of which [[Q]] = 0 follows from (8) and [[H]] = 0 is assumed. The system of equations (13), (14) with conditions (11), (12), (15) completely describes the flow of the film from the inclined bed onto the horizontal plane.  The conditions (15) show, that at the point x = 0 the film thickness is continuous, whereas its first partial derivative, since ∂H  ∂x < 0 (Fig. 1b), has the jump  x = 0 :  [[ ∂H  ∂x  ]] = ε. (16)  At the same time, the upper surface elevation `(x, t) has evidently a continuous first-order derivative with respect to x, however the second-order derivative has a jump at x = 0. Therefore, in the considered situation, the point x = 0 can be regarded as a point of weak discontinuity.  Let us now assume that the problem (9) – (12) has a solution with a jump of the film thickness Ȟ at a point x = x∗(t) (Fig. 1c). Then, owing to (8), at x = x∗(t) we have  x = x∗(t) : [[H]] = Ȟ, x ′ ∗[[H]] = [[Q]], (17)  This jump of the thickness can be caused by a step-like profile of the basal surface, or by a vertical plane hindering the film flow from above. For x′∗ 6= 0, in this situation the jump of the thickness leads to a jump of the mass flux and a discontinuity of the upper surface. It is natural to call the point x = x∗ a point of a strong discontinuity.  In the particular case, when x∗ = 0, the mass flux is continuous, but the upper surface elevation may still be a function with jump discontinuity. It should be noted, that the latter situation is frequent for mountain glaciers.  320    Fig. 1: Schematic presentation of different situations of the film motion  321    Other types of models, leading to solutions with jumps, are determined by the existence of local sources or sinks of mass, usually situated at the basal and free surfaces of the film (Fig. 1d). Considering a flat horizontal solid surface, we can write an equation of the film thickness  ∂H  ∂t +  ∂Q  ∂x = 0, x ∈ (−∞, x∗) ∪ (x∗,∞) t > 0; (18)  Q = −sign (  ∂H  ∂x  ) Hn+2  ∣∣∣∣ ∂H  ∂x  ∣∣∣∣ n  , (19)  where x∗ is the position of the mass source. The initial and boundary conditions are given by (11), (12), and the mass conservation yields  x = x∗(t) : [[H]] = 0, x ′ ∗[[H]]− [[Q]] = m̂, (20)  where m̂ is the strength of the source. This last case is especially interesting, because, first, the model (18) – (20), (11),  (12) describes ice sheet flow in geothermally active regions, second, the reaction of the film surface to such conditions is not trivial and effectively determined by the nonlinear rheology of the fluid. It follows from (20), even if the film thickness is continuous, that the mass flux suffers a jump together with the derivatives of the thickness and the surface elevation. Therefore, as for the previous problem, let us call the point x = x∗ a point of a strong jump.  Naturally, combinations of the above situations can occur. Because it is impossible to consider all these situations within one paper, let us restrict attention to the four illustrated situations being typical for considering solutions with jumps.  All the considered models are based on equations (9), (10), which admit the symmetry group with the infinitesimal operator (1). Therefore, the corresponding invariant solutions must be searched for in the form  H = ψ(z), Q = −σq(z)t−αn, σ = sign(ψ′), q = ψn+2|ψ′|n, z = xt−α. (21)  Substituting (21) into (9), (10), for the function ψ we derive  −αzψ′ = σ(ψn+2|ψ′|n)′ . (22)  Equation (22) is an ordinary second-order differential equation, for which a qualitative analysis of solutions can be performed. Based on the results of this analysis, we will be able to treat the behaviour of solutions of equations (9), (10) and to determine solution of the formulated problems.  322    3 Qualitative analysis of the equation describing the fluid flow  It can be shown that equation (22) admits a group of transformations with the infinitesimal operator z∂/∂z + +γψ∂/∂ψ, and therefore by the substitution  ψ = zγχ(z), ν = zχ′(z), (23)  where γ = (n + 1)/(2n + 1), can be transformed to the form  −αµ = σ(χn+2|µ|n)χν + σ(γ + 1)χn+2|µ|n. (24)  In the above, the subscript denotes derivative with respect of this variable. Furthermore,  ψ′ = z−βµ, (25)  where β = n/(2n + 1), µ = ν + γχ. Let E2(ν, χ) be a two-dimensional Euclidean space. Because the solutions of the  considered problems are physically meaningal only for the class of positive functions, let us consider the right-hand semi-plane (χ > 0). This semi-plane is divided by the line µ = 0 in two parts. For µ < 0, equation (24) takes the form  dν  dχ =  P (χ, ν)  F (χ, ν) , (26)  where  P (χ, ν) = α + (n + 2)νχn+1(−µ)n−1 − χn+2(−µ)n−2[(γ + 1)µ + nγν], F (χ, ν) = nνχn+2(−µ)n−2,  and for µ > 0 we have dν  dχ = −P (χ, ν)  F (χ, ν) , (27)  where  P (χ, ν) = α + (n + 2)νχn+1µn−1 + χn+2µn−2[(γ + 1)µ + nγν],  F (χ, ν) = nνχn+2µn−2.  Relations (23), (25) show that non-negative gradually decreasing solutions of (22) are determined by the solutions of (26) satisfying the conditions χ > 0, µ 6 0, and non-negative gradually increasing solutions of (22) are determined by the solutions of (27) satisfying the conditions χ > 0, µ > 0 (Fig. 2). Therefore, investigation of the solutions of equations (26), (27) in the corresponding regions allows us to determine  323    Fig. 2: Characteristics of equations (26), (27)  the behaviour of the solutions of (22). Such an investigation can be performed with the help of the qualitative theory of dynamical systems (Bautin, Leontovich 1990).  In Fig. 2, curves corresponding to the solutions of (26), (27) are presented. Equation (26) has two families of solutions L−1 and L  − 2 (dashed lines) depending  on an arbitrary parameter, with a solution L− separating them (solid line). For the family L−2 and the curve L  −, the straight line χ = 0 is a vertical asymptote. Again, for the family L−2 , as χ → 0 we have ν ∼ Kχ−(n+2)/n (the constant K > 0, which is the parameter of the family L−2 , has different values for different curves). Analogously, for L−, as χ → 0 we obtain the asymptotic formula ν ∼ −α1/nχ−(n+1)/n. As ν →∞, all solutions have the following behavior ν ∼ −γχ+Mχ−nα (the constant M < 0 takes different values for different curves; the asymptotic formula for the curve L− is determined for M = M0 < 0, and M0 can be found numerically). The curves, corresponding to the family L−1 , originate from the points (χ0,−γχ0) ∈ {µ = 0} (χ0 > 0 is the parameter of the family L−1 ). In the vicinity of these points, the behavior of the solutions of the family L−1 is described by the asymptotic formula  ν ∼ −γχ− [α(n− 1)(χ0 − χ) nγχn+30  ]1/(n−1), χ → χ0 − 0.  With (23), (25), the families L−1 , L − 2 determine the corresponding families K  − 1 , K  − 2  of gradually decreasing solutions of (22), depending on two arbitrary parameters,  324    and the curve L− determines the other family K−, depending on a single arbitrary parameter. With the help of the asymptotic formula found above, for solutions belonging to the families K−1 , K  − 2 , K  −, it is easy to obtain from (23), as χ →∞,  ψ ∼ (C + Mγ−1z)γ, q ∼ |M |n(C + Mγ−1z)γ+1, (28)  z → 0, C > 0, M < 0. Again, for the solutions of the family K− we have M = M0, for K−1 we have M > M0, and for K−2 we have M < M0.  Analogously, for the solutions K−2 , with the help of the asymptotic formula for the family L−2 as χ → 0, we find  ψ ∼ [2|K|(n + 1)n−1z(γ+1)/n0 (z0 − z)]n/[2(n+1)], q ∼ |K|nzγ+10 , (29)  z → z0 − 0, and for the solutions of K−  ψ ∼ [β−1(αz0)1/n(z0 − z)]β, q ∼ (αz0)2γβ−β(z0 − z)β, z → z0 − 0. (30)  For the solutions of the family K−1 , using the asymptotic formula for the family L − 1  as χ → χ0, we obtain  ψ ∼ χ0zγ0 , ψ′ ∼ 0, q ∼ 0, z → z0 − 0. (31)  Equation (27) has also two families of solutions L+1 , L + 2 (the dashed lines in the  region χ > 0, µ > 0, Fig. 2), separated by the solution L+ (solid line). For the curves of the family L+1 , as χ → 0, we find ν ∼ Kχ−(n+2)/n (constant K > 0 takes different values for different curves). In the plane (ψ, z) the family L+1 determines a family K+1 of gradually increasing solutions of (22), depending on two arbitrary parameters with the asymptotic formulas  ψ ∼ [2|K|(n + 1)n−1z(γ+1)/n0 (z − z0)]n/(2n+2), q ∼ |K|nzγ+10 , z → z0 + 0. (32)  As χ → ∞, all curves, corresponding to the family L+2 , are described by the asymptotic formula ν ∼ −γχ + Mχ−nα with the constant M > 0, and the curve, corresponding to the solution L+, by ν ∼ −0.5(γ + 1)αχ . Analogously, the family L+2 determines a family K  + 2 of gradually increasing solutions of (22), depending on  two arbitrary parameters with the asymptotic formulas  ψ ∼ (C + Mγ−1z)γ, q ∼ Mn(C + Mγ−1z)γ+1, z → 0, C > 0, M > 0. (33)  The solution L+ determines a family K+, depending on one arbitrary parameter with the asymptotic formulas  ψ ∼ Czn/(2n+2), q ∼ C2n+2(0.5nα)n, z → 0, C > 0. (34)  325    All the curves, corresponding to the solutions of (27), originate from the points of the straight line µ = 0, and, as for equation (26), in the vicinity of these points we have  ν ∼ −γχ + [ α(n− 1)(χ− χ0)  nγχn+30  ]1/(n−1) , χ → χ0 + 0.  In the plane (ψ, z), for the gradually increasing solutions of (22), we obtain  ψ ∼ χ0zγ0 , ψ′ ∼ 0, q ∼ 0, z → z0 + 0. (35)  The performed analysis results in the following propositions concerning the solutions of equation (22):  Proposition 1. In the region z > 0, the gradually decreasing solutions of (22) originate from the points of the coordinate axis (z = 0), and ψ(0) 6= 0, q(0) < ∞. For these solutions there exists a point z0 < ∞, at which either ψ = 0, q < ∞ (solutions of the family K−2 and K  −) or ψ′ = 0 (q = 0), ψ 6= 0 (solutions of the family K−1 ). Again, at the point z0, q = 0 only for the solutions of the family K  −, which are determined by the curve, corresponding to the solution L− of (26).  Proposition 2. The gradually increasing solutions of equation (22), in the region z > 0 originate either from the points of the coordinate axis (z = 0) or from the points of the axis (ψ = 0). Only the solutions of the family K+, determined by the solution L+ of (27), originate from the point z = 0, ψ = 0. For all gradually increasing solutions there exists a point z0 < ∞, at which ψ′ = 0 (q = 0), ψ 6= 0.  4 Solutions for the stated problems and discussion  Let us consider the different situations of the flow of the fluid film described by the system (4) – (8), (17).  4.1 Spreading of a step over a horizontal plane  Let us consider problem (9) – (12). In the variables z, ψ, i. e.,(21), it takes the form  −αzψ′ = σ(ψn+2|ψ′|n)′, z ∈ (−∞,∞), (36) z → ±∞, ψ → H±∞. (37)  Without loss of generality of the results, let us assume that H−∞ > H + ∞. In this  case, it is natural to consider only solutions belonging to the class of non-negative, gradually decreasing functions. Therefore, equation (36) can be rewritten as  αzψ′ = (ψn+2(−ψ′)n)′. (38)  326    For convenience of the analysis of the problem (36), (37), let us substitute  ϕ = ψ/H0, z̄ = z/H 1/γ 0 , q = H  (γ+1)/γ 0 q̄, (39)  where H0 = ψ(0), γ = (n + 1)/(2n + 1). The system of equations (36), (37) then takes the form  −αz̄ϕ′ = σ(ϕn+2|ϕ′|n)′, z̄ ∈ (−∞,∞), (40) z̄ = 0 : ϕ = 1, [[q̄]] = 0, (41) z̄ → ±∞, ϕ → H±∞H−10 . (42)  In the above q̄ = ϕn+2(−ϕ′)n, [[q̄]] = q̄(−0) − q̄(+0). If H±∞ is known, then the second condition (41) allows us to determine the parameter H0. Instead of imposing a value of H+∞, let us impose a value for q̄0 = q̄(0). In this case, problem (40) - (42) is replaced by the Cauchy problems for equation (40) with initial conditions  z̄ = 0, ϕ = 1, q̄ = q̄0. (43)  Given q̄0, we can find ϕ, and hence ϕ±∞ = ϕ(±∞), and consequently H0 = H−∞/ϕ−∞, H+∞ = H  − ∞ϕ  + ∞/ϕ  − ∞.  Let us consider the region z̄ > 0. In accordance with Proposition 1, the problem (40), (43) has a solution within the family K−1 or K  −, where the family is specified by the value of q̄0. Let q̄0 = q̄L for which the solution belongs to K. In this case, in accordance with Proposition 1, there exists a point z̄0 < ∞, at which ϕ = 0 and q̄ = 0. Consequently, ϕ+∞ = 0 and H  + ∞ = 0 at the points z̄ = z̄0, z = z̄0H  1 γ  0 < ∞ . The latter property appears because the mass flux q is zero for ψ = 0. In order to find q̄L, it is necessary to resolve equation (40) with the initial conditions  z̄ = z̄0 : ϕ = 0, q̄ = 0. (44)  The point z̄0 and q̄L are then determined from (43). Due to (23), a solution of the Cauchy problem (40), (44) can be written in quadrature form  ϕ(z̄) = z̄γχ, ln(z̄/z̄0) =  χ∫  0  dχ  νL(χ) , χ > 0. (45)  Because (40) possesses the symmetry z̄∂/∂z̄ + γϕ∂/∂ϕ, z̄0 can be found in explicit form. If we put  ϕ = z̄ γ 0ψ0(ζ), q̄ = z̄  γ+1 0 q0, ζ = z̄/z̄0, (46)  where q0 = ψn+20 (−ψ′0)n, the function ψ0 also satisfies (40), whence, all Propositions of section 2 are also valid for ψ0. Moreover, for ψ0 we can write a formula, analogous  327    to (45)  ψ0(ζ) = ζ γχ, ln ζ =  χ∫  0  dχ  νL(χ) , χ > 0. (47)  Expression (47) uniquely determines the function ψ0 and does not include arbitrary parameters. From Proposition 1 it follows that ψ0(0) 6= 0, and consequently from (46) and (43) we derive  z̄0 = [ψ0(0)] −1/γ, q̄L = z̄  γ+1 0 q̃0, q̃0 = q0(0). (48)  In numerical computations, it is convenient to determine ψ0 by solving a Cauchy problem in the region (0, 1) for the following equations,  ψ′0 = −q1/n0 ψ−(n+2)/n0 , q′0 = −αzq1/n0 ψ−(n+2)/n0 , (49) which is equivalent to (40) with the initial conditions  ζ = 1, ψ0 = 0, q0 = 0. (50)  The Cauchy problem (49), (50) is singular, and in order to solve it, it is necessary to use the asymptotic formula (30), putting z0 = 1 in order to consider a regular starting point from which a solution can be found without difficulties.  The quantities q̃0 and ψ̃0 = ψ0(0) depend only on n. Table 1,  n 1 2 3 4 10 ψ0(0) 1.09681 1.12328 1.15232 1.17682 1.25927  q̃0 0.41902 0.27098 0.20368 0.16426 0.07783  which includes results of the computations, shows this dependence. The physical interpretation is evident: The tendency of the liquid to move becomes weaker when n increases. Therefore, the mass flux decreases, but the thickness of the film becomes larger to sustain the given speed of its margin.  If q̄0 < q̄L, the solutions of the problem (40) – (43) belongs to the family K−1 , because M > M0 for K−1 , and q̄0 = |M |n, q̄L = |M0|n (see section 3). In accordance with Proposition 1, there exists a point z̄+∞, where ϕ 6= 0, q̄ = 0. Therefore, z̄∞ and ϕ+∞ = ϕ(z̄  + ∞) can be found by solving the Cauchy problem (40), (43) with q̄0 < q̄L.  Now, let z̄ < 0. If z̄ is replaced by −z̄, then the considered region transforms to the domain, where z̄ > 0, and equation (40) takes such a form, that describes gradually increasing solutions. Therefore, in accordance with Proposition 2, there exists a solution of (40), (43) belonging to K+2 and a point z̄  − ∞, where ϕ 6= 0, q̄ = 0.  Consequently, ϕ∞ = ϕ(z̄−∞). The locations of the points z̄+∞, z̄  − ∞ are determined by the fact that the mass flux  is equal to zero when ψ′ = 0. When n = 1 (Newtonian liquid), z̄±∞ → ±∞. Now we can describe the algorithm to find a solution of the problem (36), (37).  328    1. The functions ψ0(ζ), q0(ζ) are found in the region ζ < 1 by solving the Cauchy problems (49), (50).  2. The values of z̄0, q̄L are determined from (48).  3. The values of ζ∞, ψ∞ are determined from the conditions q0(ζ∞) = 0, ψ∞ = ψ0(ζ∞).  4. If H+∞ = 0, then owing to (39), (46), (48), the solutions of the problem (36), (37) can be written in the form  ψ(z) = H−∞, z < z − ∞,  ψ(z) = (z−∞/ζ∞) γψ0(zz  −1 0 ), z  − ∞ 6 z 6 z0, (51)  ψ(z) = 0, z > z0,  z0 = [H − ∞/ψ0(ζ∞)]  1/γ; z−∞ = ζ∞[H − ∞/ψ0(ζ∞)]  1/γ. (52)  5. If H+∞ 6= 0, then the functions ϕ(z̄), q̄(z̄) are found from the equations  ϕ′ = −q̄1/nϕ−(n+2)/n, q̄′ = −αz̄q̄1/nϕ−(n+2)/n, (53)  which are equivalent to (40), with the initial conditions (43) for q̄0 < q̄L. The values of z̄±∞, ϕ  ± ∞ are determined from the conditions  q̄(z̄±∞) = 0, ϕ ± ∞ = ϕ(z̄  ± ∞). (54)  6. For H+∞ 6= 0, the solution of (36), (37) can be written as  ψ(z) = H−∞, z < z − ∞,  ψ(z) = H−∞(ϕ − ∞)  −1ϕ(zz̄−∞/z − ∞), z  − ∞ 6 z 6 z  + ∞, (55)  ψ(z) = H+∞, z > z + ∞,  H+∞ = H − ∞ϕ  + ∞/ϕ  − ∞, z  ± ∞ = z̄  ± ∞(H  − ∞/ϕ  − ∞)  1/γ. (56)  It should be noted that the points z0, z±∞ are points of jumps of the derivatives. The existence of these points is determined by the properties of equation (40). Evidently, the functions ψ0 and ϕ together with their derivatives are continuous at the point z = 0. Hence, the initial jump of the surface of the film is smoothed out. Fig. 3 illustrates the behavior of the function ψ(z) when H+∞ = 0 (line 1) and H+∞ 6= 0 (line 2) for n = 3. Fig. 4 shows how the free surface of the film evolves when H−∞ = 1, H  + ∞ = 0.1728, n = 3. It illustrates the disturbances in the region  z−∞t 1/(n+1) 6 x 6 z+∞t1/(n+1). For z > 0, the problem (40), (43) can be considered as describing an outflow  of the fluid film from an orifice. Therefore, in this situation we can consider the  329    Fig. 3: Behavior of the function ψ(z) when H+∞ = 0 (line 1) and H + ∞ = 0.1728 (line 2) and  for n = 3  Fig. 4: Dynamics of the free surface of the film when H+∞ = 0.1728 (line 1 – t = 0.1, line 2 – t = 10, line 3 – t = 1000) and n = 3  330    problem only in the region z > 0 by assuming H = 1 for z = 0 (Subsections 4.3 and 4.4). However, if it is necessary to know the thickness of the film for z > 0, then it can be found by solving the Cauchy problem (53), (43) in this region.  The situation under consideration is frequently encountered in glaciology. For example, it can be caused artificially, by exerting influence on the glacier (Aizin and Chugunov 1989). Strictly speaking, the mathematical model of ice sheet dynamics includes equations (4), (5) with non-zero accumulation rate S and bedrock slope z′b, which here were assumed to vanish. Moreover, the boundary conditions are imposed at the ends of a finite segment. However, the derived solution describes ice sheet motion at small time scales fairly well. Because the problem (9) – (12) admits the symmetry (1), the found invariant solutions together with the system of equations (9) – (12), do not change once the substitution t = t̄ exp[(n + 1)a], x = x̄ exp(a), where a is an arbitrary parameter is made. Therefore, if H(x, t) is a solution in the coordinates x, t, then in the coordinates x̄, t̄, it will have the same form H(x̄, t̄).  Let us write equations (4), (5) in new variables x̄, t̄, by assuming U0 = 0, z′b = O(1),  ∂Ha ∂t̄  + ∂Q̄  ∂x̄ = exp[(n + 1)a]S̄(x̄, t̄), (57)  Q̄ = Hn+2a  ( −∂Ha  ∂x̄ − ∂zb  ∂x exp(a)  )n , (58)  t̄ = 0 : Ha = H + ∞, x̄ > 0, Ha = H  − ∞, x̄ < 0;  x̄ = x1 exp(−a) : Ha = H+∞; x̄ = x2 exp(−a) : Ha = H−∞.  In the above S̄(x̄, t̄) = S(x̄ exp(a), t̄ exp[(n+1)a]), and the subscript a describes the dependence of the solution on the parameter a. It can be seen that, as a → −∞, (57), (58) transform to the considered problem (9), (12). Hence, assuming existence of a solution of (57), (58), we can write  Ha(x̄, t̄) = H(x̄, t̄) + O(exp(a)), a → −∞.  Returning to the previous variables and taking into account that H is invariant and x̄, t̄ = O(1), we can find  Ha(x, t) = H(x, t) + O(t 1/(n+1)), t → 0. (59)  Physically, this means that, when the reaction of the ice sheet to local disturbances is relatively fast (which is, in turn, determined by high local gradients), then the mass accumulation rate and bedrock slope can be neglected and accounted for as higher-order effects.  331    4.2 Flow of a film from an inclined plane onto a horizontal plane  This problem differs from the previous one by accounting for the change of the lower surface slope. In this case, it will be shown that at the point, where the inclined plane meets the horizontal plane with a kink, even for small slopes, there exist jumps of the thickness and the second-order derivative of the upper surface elevation. Let us consider the most interesting case, when H+∞ = 0. The mathematical model (11) (15), describing flow of the film from the inclined onto the horizontal plane, does not admit the symmetry (1). However, it is possible to speak of inheriting this symmetry. Namely, if we also transform the parameter ε, then it is easy to ascertain, that the equation under consideration has a symmetry described by the infinitesimal operator  Xε = X̂ + ε ∂  ∂ε . (60)  The invariants of this symmetry are  I1 = xt −1/(n+1), η = −εt1/(n+1), I3 = H.  Therefore, the solution of the problem (11) - (14) takes the form  H = H(z, η), z = I1/z0, z0 = g(η), (61)  where z0 is the coordinate of the film margin. The functions H(z, η), g(η) can be found in the form  H(z, η) = Ĥ(z) + ηH1(z) + O(η 2), g(η) = g0 + ηg1 + O(η  2), (62) q(z, η) = q̂(z) + ηq1(z) + O(η  2), (63)  where q(z, t) = Hn+2  ( −∂H  ∂z  )n , z > 0, (64)  q(z, t) = Hn+2 ( −∂H  ∂z + ε  )n , z < 0.  Because of (61) – (4.2), the problem (11) – (14) breaks up into problems for Ĥ, q̂, g0 and H1, q1, g1. For the zeroth-order terms Ĥ, q̂, g0 we have  αgn+10 zĤ ′ = q̂′, q̂ = Ĥn+2| −H ′|n, −∞ < z < 1; (65)  z = 1 : Ĥ = 0, q̂ = 0; (66) z → −∞, Ĥ → H−∞, (67)  332    whilst for the first-order terms H1, q1, g1 we derive  αgn0 [(n + 2)g1zĤ ′ + g0zH  ′ 1 − g0H1] = q′1, −∞ < z < 1; (68)  q1(z, η) = (n + 2)Ĥ n+1(−Ĥ ′)n + nĤn+2(−Ĥ ′)n−1(−H ′1), z > 0, (69)  q1(z, η) = (n + 2)Ĥ n+1(−Ĥ ′)n + nĤn+2(−Ĥ ′)n−1(−H ′1 − g0), (70)  z < 0,  z = 1 : H1 = 0, q1 = 0; (71) z = 0 : [[H ′1]] = −g0, [[H1]] = 0; (72)  z → −∞, H1 → 0. (73)  Let us consider the leading-order problem (65) – (67). By the substitution  Ĥ = g γ 0ψ0(ζ), q̂ = g  2γ(n+1) 0 q0(ζ), z = ζ, (74)  it can be transformed to problem (49), (50) already solved. The parameter g0 is found from (67)  g0 = (H − ∞/ψ∞)  1/γ, (75)  where ψ∞ = ψ0(ζ∞), and ζ∞ is determined by the condition q0(ζ∞) = 0 (see subsection 4.1).  With (75) equations (74) take the form  Ĥ(z) =  { (H−∞/ψ∞)ψ0(z), z < ζ∞, 0, z > ζ∞,  (76)  q̂(z) =  { (H−∞/ψ∞)  2(n+1)q0(z), z < ζ∞, 0, z > ζ∞.  Now, the first-order problem (68) – (73) can be written as  α(zH ′1 −H1) = (−nr0(z)H ′1 + (n + 2)p0(z)H1)′ + g−(n+1)0 f(z), (77) −∞ < z < 1,  z = 1 : H1 = 0, q1 = 0,  z = 0 : [[H ′1]] = −g0, [[H1]] = 0, z → −∞, H1 → 0,  where  r0(z) = ψ n+2 0 (−ψ′0)n−1, p0(z) = ψn+10 (−ψ′0)n, (78)  f(z) = −ngn+20 f1(z)− α(n + 2)gn+γ0 g1f2(z), (79) f1(z) =  { r′0(z), z < 0 0, z > 0,  , f2(z) = zψ ′ 0(z). (80)  333    Let us expand H1 and the coefficients of (77) in terms of (1 − z). Using (78) and the asymptotic formulas (30), we derive  ψ0(z) = β −1α1/n(1− z)β + o((1− z)β), (81)  r0(z) = γ −1(1− z) + o(1− z), p0(z) = α(n + 2)gn+20 + o(1). (82)  The function H1 satisfies the linear, inhomogeneous equation (77). The corresponding homogeneous equation can be written in the form  α(zω′ − ω) = (−nr0(z)ω′ + (n + 2)p0(z)ω)′. (83) In accordance with the theory of ordinary differential equations, if the coefficients of the equation have the form (82), then a solution of (83) is given by  ω = (1− z)τ (1 + o(1)). The indicial equation for τ is obtained from (83) on using (82) and has the form  (n + 1)τ = −(2n + 1)τ 2. Hence, τ1 = −γ and τ2 = 0, and we have the two independent solutions  ω1 = (1− z)−γ(1 + o(1)), ω2 = 1 + o(1). (84) A general solution of (83) is therefore  ω = Aω1(z) + Bω2(z), (85)  where A, B are arbitrary constants. The asymptotic formulas (84) show that the function ω does not satisfy the  condition ω(1) = 0 for any values of A and B. Therefore, we conclude that the first condition of (71) determines the unique function H1 for z > 0.  In accordance with expression (79), a solution of (80), (71) – (73) can be found in the form  H1(z) = g0V̂ (z) + g γ−1 0 g1Û(z), (86)  where V̂ , Û are independent of the parameters g0, g1. Taking into account (79), (86), from (80), (71) – (73) it is easy to obtain the problems for V̂ , Û  α(zV̂ ′ − V̂ ) = (−nr0(z)V̂ ′ + (n + 2)p0(z)V̂ )′ − nf1(z), z < 1; (87) z = 1 : V̂ = 0;  z = 0 : [[V̂ ′]] = −1, [[V̂ ]] = 0; α(zÛ ′ − Û) = (−nr0(z)Û ′ + (n + 2)p0(z)Û)′ − α(n + 2)f2(z), z < 1 (88)  z = 1 : Û = 0;  z = 0 : [[Û ′]] = −1, [[Û ]] = 0.  334    Since f1 ≡ 0 when z > 0, then V̂ = ω for 0 < z < 1, but V̂ (1) = 0, therefore V̂ ≡ 0. Equations (87) determine the continuous function Û with continuous derivatives.  Its asymptotic behaviour as z → 1 can be found from (87), taking into account (81), (82),  Û(z) = (n + 2)β−1α1/n(1− z)1−γ/(3n + 2) + o((1− z)1−γ). (89) Therefore,  H1(z) = (90) = (n + 2)g  γ−1 0 g1β  −1α1/n(1− z)1−γ/(3n + 2) + o((1− z)1−γ), q1(z) =  = α(1− n)(n + 2)gn+γ0 g1β−1α1/n(1− z)β/(3n + 2) + o((1− z)β). (91) Consequently, q1 = 0 for z = 1 and the boundary condition for H1 at the point z = 1 is satisfied. Using (88), it is possible to reach a regular point z = 1− δ and to find Û by solving the Cauchy problem for equation (87) in the region z < 1− δ.  Since the coefficients of equation (77) and the function f(z) differ from zero in the region z > ζ∞, the functions V̂ , Û must be determined in the region ζ∞ < z < 1. The parameter g1 can be found from the condition H1(ζ∞ + ε∞) = 0, where ε∞ is introduced, because the point z = ζ∞ is singular. The value of ε∞ is calculated from the condition H ′1(ζ∞+ε∞) = 0. Now, we can formulate an algorithm of determining H1(z) and g1:  1. First, the Cauchy problem  dV̂  dz = −Ŵ − (n + 2)p0V̂  nr0 ,  dŴ  dz = −α  [ z Ŵ − (n + 2)p0V̂  nr0 + V̂  ] + nf1, z < 0,  z = 0 : V̂ = 0, Ŵ = nr0,  which is equivalent to (87), is solved.  2. Second, the Cauchy problem  dÛ  dz = −Ω̂− (n + 2)p0Û  nr0 ,  dΩ̂  dz = −α  [ z Ω̂− (n + 2)p0Û  nr0 + Û  ] + α(n + 2)f2, z < 1;  z = 1 : Û = 0, Ω̂ = 0,  which is equivalent to (88), is solved.  335    Fig. 5: Behaviour of the functions H1 and H ′1 for n = 3  3. The parameter g1 is found from the condition H1(ζ∞ + ε∞) = 0:  g1 = − V̂ (ζ∞ + ε∞)  g γ−2 0 Û(ζ∞ + ε∞)  .  4. Taking into account (62), (75), (76), (86), the film thickness is calculated by means of the formula  H(z) =  { g  γ 0ψ0(z) + η(g0V̂ (z) + g  γ−1 0 g1Û(z)), ζ ∈ (ζ∞ + ε∞, 1)  H−∞, z 6 ζ∞ + ε∞, (92)  The level of the free surface and the position of the margin are given by  `(x, t) = −εx + H(x/x0(t)), x 6 x0(t), (93) x0(t) = (g0 − εt1/(n+1)g1)t1/(n+1).  Results of numerical computations are presented in Figs. 5,6,7. In Fig. 5, curves 1,2 describe the functions H1 and H ′1 for n = 3. Fig. 6 shows the change of the film thickness. It can be seen that, at the point z = 0, the gradient of H(z) suffers a jump, whereas the free surface elevation is smooth (Fig. 7), In Fig. 7 curve 1 corresponds to the time t = 1, curve 2 to t = 100 and curve 3 to t = 104 (n = 3, g0 = 0.3548, g1 = −0.2251).  336    Fig. 6: Change of the film thickness for the situation of Fig. 5  Fig. 7: Dynamics of the free surface of the film  337    It is easy to show that the second-order derivatives of `(x, t) have the jumps [[  ∂2`  ∂x2  ]] = ε  (n + 2)(−ψ0)′ nψ0  t−1/(n+1), (94) [[  ∂2`  ∂t2  ]] = ε  g21 g0  t−(2n−1)/(n+1).  From equations (6), (7), (94) it follows that the vertical velocity W has a jump at the point x = 0. The magnitude of this jump can be significant at the beginning of the flow. This means that during such early time intervals, even in the vicinity of the point of a weak discontinuity, where a jump of the basal surface slope exists, the boundary layer approximation can break down. Therefore, in studying flows near such points at small-times, it is necessary to search for a so-called internal expansion valid in the vicinity of the singular points.  It should be noted, that formulas (92), (93) completely confirms the conclusion, formulated in the form of expression (59). The situation considered in this subsection is typical for mountain glaciers. For example, the marginal part of the Kozelski Glacier, which is near Avacha volcano in Kamchatka Peninsular, is situated on a slope, which is two times smaller than the slope of the bed of its main part (Chugunov 1995).  We proceed from the problem of a weak to examples of a strong discontinuity.  4.3 Outflow from an orifice with the thickness jump ∆∗ at the point z∗  Let us consider the problem (9) – (12), (17) with x∗(t) = z∗tα. Then, equations (9) – (12), (17) admit the symmetry (1), and the substitution (21) is possible. For convenience of the analysis we assume H+∞ = 0 and z∗ > 0. Therefore, it is sufficient to consider the region z > 0. In the considered case, the solution must also be sought for in the class of gradually decreasing functions, therefore σ = −1. It follows from Proposition 1 that, when z > z∗, the sought solution ψ(z) ∈ K− determines the film margin z = z̃0, where ψ and q are equal to zero. In the variables z̄, ϕ, q̄ (see (39)) the mathematical model takes the form  αz̄ϕ′ = q̄′, q̄ = (ϕn+2(−ϕ′))′, z̄ ∈ (0, z̄∗) ∪ (z̄∗, 1), (95) z̄ = 0, ϕ = 1, z̄ = z̃0, ϕ = 0, q̄ = 0, (96)  αz̄∗[[ϕ]] = [[q̄]], [[ϕ]] = ∆∗, (97)  where ∆∗ = H−10 Ȟ. Analogously to formulas (46), we put  ϕ = z̃ γ 0 ψ̂0(ζ), q̄ = z̃  γ+1 0 q̂0, ζ = z̄/z̃0, q̄0 = ψ̂  n+2 0 (−ψ̂′0)n. (98)  338    Substituting (98) into (95) – (97), we derive  αζψ̂′0 = q̂ ′ 0, ζ ∈ (0, ζ∗) ∪ (ζ∗, 1), (99)  ζ = 0, ψ̂0 = z̃ −γ 0 , ζ = 1, ψ̂0 = 0, q̂0 = 0, (100)  αζ∗[[ψ̂0]] = [[q̂0]], [[ψ̂0]] = z̃ −γ 0 ∆∗, ζ∗ = z̄∗/z̃0. (101)  The problem (99) – (101) involves only three parameters z̃0, ζ∗, ∆∗, among which only two are arbitrary. It is natural to impose the position z̄∗ and the value of the jump ∆∗. However, for the numerical solution of (99) – (101) it is convenient to impose [[ψ̂0]] and ζ∗, and then to compute z̃0, z̄∗, ∆∗. Let us rewrite (99) – (101) in the form  ψ̂′0 = −q̂1/n0 ψ̂−(n+2)/n0 , q̂′0 = −αζq̂1/n0 ϕ−(n+2)/n, ζ ∈ (ζ∗, 1), (102) ζ = 1, ψ̂0 = 0, q̂0 = 0, (103)  ψ̂′0 = −q̂1/n0 ψ̂−(n+2)/n0 , q̂′0 = −αζq̂1/n0 ψ̂−(n+2)/n0 , ζ ∈ (0, ζ∗), (104) ζ = ζ∗, ψ̂0 = ψ̂0(ζ∗ + 0) + [[ψ̂0]], q̂0 = q̂0(ζ∗ + 0) + αζ∗[[ψ̂0]]. (105)  From the first equation of (100), we have  z̃0 = [ψ̂0(0)] −1/γ, (106)  and again z̄∗ = ζ∗z̃0, ∆∗ = z̃  γ 0 [[ψ̂0]]. (107)  The algorithm for constructing the solution of the problem under consideration consists of the following steps:  1. First, the Cauchy problem (102), (103), completely coinciding with problem (49), (50), is solved. Therefore, ψ̂0 = ψ0(ζ) ∈ K−, ζ ∈ (ζ∗, 1).  2. The Cauchy problem (104), (105) is solved. The unique solution of this problem is determined by the conditions [[ψ̂0]] > −ψ0(ζ∗+0) and q̄0(ζ∗+0)+αζ∗[[ψ̂0]] > 0, ζ∗ ∈ (0, 1).  3. The value of z̃0 is found from (106), and, then z̄∗, ∆∗ are determined from (107).  4. When the function ψ̂0 and the position of the film margin z̃0 are known, the function ψ and the film thickness H(x, t) can be found from (98), (39), (21).  On the basis of this algorithm, a number of computations were performed for n = 3. Fig. 8 shows the dependence of the absolute value of the parameter M in the asymptotic formulas (28) on the parameters [[ψ̂0]], ζ (ζ ∈ (0, ζ∗), ψ̂0(ζ) ∈ K−1 ,  339    Fig. 8: Dependence of the parameter M on the [[ψ̂0]] and ζ∗ for n = 3. Curves 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 correspond to the values of ζ∗ = 0.1; 0.3; 0.5; 0.7; 0.9  if M > M0, and ψ̂0(ζ) ∈ K−2 , if M < M0 ). It should be noted that, due to (28), for the solutions belonging to the family K−, the condition  M0 = −(z̄γ0 q̃0)1/n (108)  must hold, where q̃0 = q0(0), and q0, z̄0 are determined as shown in subsection 3.1. Curves 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in this figure correspond to the following values of ζ∗ = 0.1; 0.3; 0.5; 0.7; 0.9.  Table 2  [[ψ̂0]] -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 q̂0(0) 0.1589 0.1694 0.1939 0.2036 0.2245 0.2466 0.2695  shows the characteristic dependence of q̂0 on [[ψ̂0]] for ζ∗ = 0.5 (the computations showed that such a behavior is characteristic for all ζ∗ and n). Inspection of Fig. 8 and Table 2 allows us, with the help of inequality M(K−2 ) < M0 < M(K  − 1 ), to  formulate the following Proposition 3. If [[ψ̂0]] > 0 , then a solution of the problem (104), (105) in the interval (0, ζ∗) belongs to the family K−1 with q̂0(0) > q̃0; alternatively it belongs to the family K−2 with q̂0(0) < q̃0, if [[ψ̂0]] < 0.  Accuracy of this proposition is evident because the pertaining to the families K−1 , K  − 2 is determined by the value of the parameter M , and M is the gradually  increasing function (Fig. 8, and M < 0) of [[ψ̂0]]. From Proposition 3, the following  340    Fig. 9: Dependence of the margin of the film on the value and the position of the jump  inequality follows q̂ (2) 0 (0) < q̃0 < q̂  (1) 0 (0), (109)  where q̂(2)0 (0), q̂ (1) 0 (0) are the values of q̂0(0) determined by the families K  − 1 , K  − 2  respectively. With (109) inequalities (108) lead to the estimates  q̃0 < q̂ (1) 0 (0) < q̃0(z̄0/z̃  (1) 0 )  γ+1, q̃0(z̄0/z̃ (2) 0 )  γ+1 < q̂ (2) 0 (0) < q̃0, (110)  where z̃(1)0 , z̃ (2) 0 are the values of z̃0 for the solutions of the families K  − 1 , K  − 2 ,  respectively. In terms of the original form of the problem (H0 = 1), relations (110) can be rewritten in the form  q̃0[z̃0(∆∗, z̄∗)] γ+1 < q(0) < q̃0z̄  γ+1 0 , ∆∗ > 0,  q̃0z̄ γ+1 0 < q(0) < q̃0[z̃0(∆∗, z̄∗)]  γ+1, ∆∗ < 0. (111)  If the dependence z̃0(∆∗, z̄∗) is known, then inequality (111) is convenient to use for the determination of the mass flux at the boundary x = 0. Moreover, if in the original form of the problem the mass flux at x = 0 and the margin position are imposed, then (111) can be considered as conditions determining the existence of a solution of the problem.  In treating the original form of the problem, it is natural to consider z∗ and ∆∗ as known parameters. Therefore, it is interesting to know the dependence of z̃0 on  341
