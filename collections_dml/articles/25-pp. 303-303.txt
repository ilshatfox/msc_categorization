)   SOME PROPERTIES OF B-MANIFOLDS   Let V2n Ье а Riema.nnian manifold with metric g. If (V2k, ip) is a.n  almost algebraic manifold with pure metric, we say that (V2k, ip, g)  is an almost B-manifold. А B-metric on а B-manifold is called  holomorphic if ф"' =О where ф"' is the Tachibana operator.   Here we consider а holomorphic B-manifold which is a.nalogous  to the Kahler manifolds. An almost B-manifold is holomorphic Bmanifold if and only if the almost algebraic structure is parallel with  respect to the Levi - Civita connection.   303
