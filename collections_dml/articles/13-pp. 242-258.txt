 ECONOMIC EQUILIBRIUM PROBLEMS  E. Volotskaya Kazan State University  We consider an economic application of the mixed variational inequality problem which involves a continuous mapping and a convex, but not necessarily differentiable function. We specialize several existence and uniqueness results for this problem and describe results of solving such a problem via the D-gap function approach.  1 Introduction  LetK and V be nonempty convex sets in the real Euclidean space Rn, K ⊆ V ; let f : V → R be a convex, but not necessarily differentiable function, and let G : V → Rn be a mapping. The mixed variational inequality problem (MVI for short) is the problem of finding x∗ ∈ K such that  〈G(x∗), x− x∗〉+ f(x)− f(x∗) ≥ 0 ∀x ∈ K. (1.1)  Problem (1.1) was originally considered by Lescarret [1] and Browder [2] and afterwards studied by many authors; e. g., see [3, 4]. It reduces to the usual variational inequality problem (VI for short) in the case where f ≡ 0. Most of the works are devoted to establish existence and uniqueness results for problem (1.1) under various assumptions on G and f and suggest solution methods.  This work is devoted to an economic application of MVI (1.1). Namely, we consider the economic equilibrium problem in the case where each i-th consumer demands a single commodity. We show that this problem can be reformulated as MVI of form (1.1) where the mapping G is M0. We present several existence and uniqueness results for this class of problems. In addition, properties obtained enable us to find a solution of MVI (1.1) with the help of the Dgap function approach, which was adjusted for such problems in [5, 6]. It consists in converting MVI (1.1) into the problem of finding a stationary point of a differentiable function. Therefore, one can  242    E. Volotskaya  find economic equilibrium with the help of the usual differentiable optimization methods, such as the steepest descent and conjugate gradient methods.  In what follows, for a vector x ∈ Rn, x ≥ 0 (respectively, x > 0) means xi ≥ 0 (respectively, xi > 0) for all i = 1, . . . , n; Rn+ denotes the nonnegative orthant in Rn, i. e.,  Rn+ = {x ∈ Rn | x ≥ 0};  Rn> denotes the interior of R n +, i. e.,  Rn> = {x ∈ Rn | x > 0}.  We denote by In the identity map in R n, i. e. the n× n unit matrix.  For a set E, Π(E) denotes the family of all subsets of E.  2 Preliminaries  In this section, we recall several definitions and related properties of mappings.  Definition 2.1. [7, 8] An n× n matrix A is said to be (a) a P -matrix if it has positive principal minors; (b) a P0-matrix if it has nonnegative principal minors; (c) a Z-matrix if it has non-positive off-diagonal entries; (d) an M -matrix if it has non-positive off-diagonal entries and its  inverse A−1 exists and has non-negative entries.  It is well known that an n × n matrix A is P if and only if, for every vector x 6= 0, there exists an index k such that xkyk > 0 where y = Ax. Similarly, A is P0 if and only if, for every vector x, there exists an index k such that xkyk ≥ 0, xk 6= 0 where y = Ax. Also, it is well known that A is M if and only if A ∈ P ∩Z; see [7, 8]. Hence, each M -matrix is P , but the reverse assertion is not true in general.  Definition 2.2. [7, 8] An n × n matrix A is said to be an M0matrix if it is both P0- and Z-matrix.  The following proposition gives a criterion for a matrix A to be an M - or M0-matrix.  243    On a class of economic equilibrium problems  Proposition 2.1. [7] Suppose A is a Z-matrix. If there exists a vector x > 0 such that Ax > 0 (respectively, Ax ≥ 0), then A is an M -matrix (respectively, M0-matrix).  Now we recall extensions of these properties for mappings.  Definition 2.3. [9] Let U be a convex subset of Rn. A mapping F : U → Rn is said to be  (a) a P -mapping, if max 1≤i≤n  (xi − yi)(Fi(x) − Fi(y)) > 0 for all x, y ∈ U, x 6= y;  (b) a P0-mapping, if for all x, y ∈ U , x 6= y, there exists an index i such that xi 6= yi and (xi − yi)(Fi(x)− Fi(y)) ≥ 0.  (c) a uniform P -mapping, if there exists τ > 0 such that  max 1≤i≤n  (xi − yi)(Fi(x)− Fi(y)) ≥ τ‖x− y‖2  for all x, y ∈ U ;  If F is affine, i. e., F (x) = Ax + b, then F is a P -mapping (P0mapping) if and only if its Jacobian ∇F (x) = A is a P -matrix (P0matrix). In the general nonlinear case, if the Jacobian ∇F (x) is a P -matrix, then F is a P -mapping, but the reverse assertion is not true in general. At the same time, F is a P0-mapping if and only if its Jacobian ∇F (x) is a P0-matrix, e. g. see [6, 9, 10].  Definition 2.4. (e. g., see [4, 11, 12]) Let U be a convex subset of Rn. A mapping Q : U → Π(Rn) is said to be  (a) strongly monotone with constant τ > 0, if for all u′, u′′ ∈ U and q′ ∈ Q(u′), q′′ ∈ Q(u′′), we have  〈q′ − q′′, u′ − u′′〉 ≥ τ‖u′ − u′′‖2;  (b) strictly monotone, if for all u′, u′′ ∈ U , u′ 6= u′′ and q′ ∈ Q(u′), q′′ ∈ Q(u′′), we have  〈q′ − q′′, u′ − u′′〉 > 0;  (c) monotone, if for all u′, u′′ ∈ U and q′ ∈ Q(u′), q′′ ∈ Q(u′′), we have  〈q′ − q′′, u′ − u′′〉 ≥ 0.  244    E. Volotskaya  Note that if a single-valued mapping F : U → Rn is monotone (respectively, strictly monotone, strongly monotone), then it is a P0mapping (respectively, P -mapping, uniform P -mapping), but the reverse assertions are not true in general.  3 The model  Let us consider an economic equilibrium model which deals in n commodities, where each producer supplies a single commodity, but its supply mapping is in general multivalued. This is the case if for example there are several technological processes of production. Without loss of generality, we suppose that each j-th producer supplies the single j-th commodity for j = 1, . . . , n. Then, given a price vector  p ∈ Rn+, the supply mapping is of the form S(p) = n∏  i=1  Si(pi), where  Si : R+ → Π(R) for i = 1, . . . , n. If each Si is monotone, then Si = ∂fi, where fi : R+ → R is a general convex function; e. g., see [13].  Next, we suppose that each i-th consumer demands the single i-th commodity, and that each i-th consumer has the inventory of  commodities b(i) = (β (i) 1 , . . . , β  (i) n ). Then its individual demand is  defined by:  X (i) i (p) =  n∑  j=1  pjβ (i) j /pi.  Hence, the total demand mapping is defined as follows: D(p) = n∑  i=1  X (i) i (p). As usual, we denote by E the excess demand mapping,  i. e., E(p) = D(p) − S(p). Note that it is multivalued in general. Traditionally, a vector p∗ ∈ Rn is said to be an equilibrium price if it solves the following complementarity problem:  p∗ ≥ 0, ∃q∗ ∈ E(p∗) : q∗ ≤ 0, 〈p∗, q∗〉 = 0.  In this work the feasible prices are assumed to be contained in the box-constrained set  K = n∏  i=1  Ki,Ki = {t ∈ R | 0 < τ ′  i ≤ t ≤ τ ′′  i ≤ +∞}, i = 1, . . . n.  245    On a class of economic equilibrium problems  In other words, each price of a commodity which is involved in the market structure has a lower positive bound and may have an upper bound. Thus, the problem of finding an equilibrium price can be formulated as follows (e. g. see [15]): Find p∗ ∈ K such that  〈G(p∗), p− p∗〉+ n∑  i=1  [fi(pi)− fi(p∗i )] ≥ 0 ∀p ∈ K, (3.1)  where G = −D and ∂fi = Si for every i = 1, . . . , n. Clearly, this problem is of form (1.1). Next, we see that  ∇G(p) = −∇D(p) = (δij)i,j=1,...,n,  where  δij =     −β(i)j /pi, if i 6= j,  n∑ s=1,s6=i  psβ (i) s /p  2 i , if i = j.  Hence ∇G(p) is a Z-matrix. We see that  n∑  j=1  δijpj = n∑  j=1  ∂Gi(p)  ∂pj pj =  n∑  s=1,s6=i  psβ (i) s  pi +  n∑  j=1,j 6=i  −pjβ(i)j pi  = 0  (3.2)  for all i = 1, . . . , n.  It follows from Proposition 2.1 that ∇G(p) is an M0-matrix for each p ∈ Rn>, and, hence, G is a P0-mapping.  Definition 3.1. (e. g. see [14]) A mapping Q : V → Rn is said (a) to satisfy the gross substitutability property, if ∂Qj/∂pi ≥ 0,  j 6= i; (b) to be positive homogeneous of degree m, if Q(αx) = αmQ(x)  for every α ≥ 0.  From the considerations above it follows that the demand mapping D is positive homogeneous of degree 0, and possesses the gross substitutability property in this model. First we give several existence and uniqueness results from [15].  246    E. Volotskaya  Proposition 3.1. (a) [15, Proposition 7] Let K be a bounded set. Then MVI (3.1) has a solution.  (b) [15, Proposition 8] Let K be a bounded set and let Si, i = 1, . . . , n be strictly monotone. Then MVI (3.1) has a unique solution.  (c) [15, Proposition 9] Let Si, i = 1, . . . , n be strongly monotone. Then MVI (3.1) has a unique solution.  For the index set L = {1, . . . , l}, we will write xL = (xi)i∈L and Al(x) = ∇xLGL(x). Hence, An(x) = ∇G(x). We denote by In the identity map in Rn, i. e. the n× n unit matrix.  Proposition 3.2. [15, Proposition 6 and Theorem 3] Let G be a differentiable P0-mapping. Suppose that, for every x ∈ K, ∇G(x) is a Z-matrix and for a fixed k, fi, i = k+1, . . . , n, are strongly convex functions. In addition, suppose that for a fixed k either  (a) Ak(x) is a P -matrix for all x ∈ K and K is bounded, or (b) there exists ε > 0 such that Ak(x)− εIk is a P -matrix for all  x ∈ K. Then MVI(3.1) has a unique solution.  Now we present new existence and uniqueness results for the problem under consideration. We begin from the bounded case.  Proposition 3.3. Suppose that K is bounded and that there exists an index k such that  β (i) j 6= 0 for all i = 1, . . . , k, j = k + 1, . . . , n.  If, in addition, Sj, j = k+1, . . . , n, are strongly monotone, then MVI (3.1) has a unique solution.  Proof. Recall that ∇G(p) is a Z-matrix. From (3.2) and assumptions above it follows that  k∑  j=1  ∂Gi(p)  ∂pj pj =  n∑  j=1,j 6=i  pjβ (i) j  pi +  k∑  j=1,j 6=i  −pjβ(i)j pi  =  n∑  j=k+1  pjβ (i) j  pi > 0  for all i = 1, . . . , k.  247    On a class of economic equilibrium problems  On account of Proposition 2.1, Ak(p) is a P -matrix. The result follows from Proposition 3.2 (a). 2  We now give an additional example of sufficient conditions for (3.1) to have a unique solution.  Corollary 3.1. Suppose that K is bounded and that  β(i)n 6= 0 for all i = 1, . . . , n− 1. (3.3)  If, in addition, Sn is strongly monotone, then MVI (3.1) has a unique solution.  Proof. To prove the result it suffices fix k = n− 1 in Proposition 3.3. 2  Next, if all the mappings Si, i = 1, . . . , n, are not strongly monotone, we can replace the cost mapping G in (3.1) by G(ε), whose components are defined by  G (ε) i (p) =  { Gi(p), if i < n; Gi(p) + εpi, if i = n;  where ε > 0 is an arbitrary sufficiently small number. If (3.3) holds, then such a perturbed MVI will have a unique solution which is close to that of the initial problem.  We can state similar results in the unbounded case.  Proposition 3.4. Suppose that there exist ε > 0 and an index k such that for every p ∈ K, we have  n∑  j=k+1  β (i) j pj > εp  2 i for all i = 1, . . . , k. (3.4)  If, in addition, Sj, j = k+1, . . . , n, are strongly monotone, then MVI (3.1) has a unique solution.  Proof. We see that  Ak(p)− εIk = (δ̃ij)i=1,...,k,j=1,...,k,  248    E. Volotskaya  where  δ̃ij =     −β(i)j /pi, if i 6= j,  n∑ j=1,j 6=i  pjβ (i) j /p  2 i − ε, if i = j.  Recall that ∇G(p) is a Z-matrix. From (3.2) and assumptions above it follows that  k∑  j=1  δ̃ijpj =  n∑  j=1,j 6=i  pjβ (i) j  pi − εpi +  k∑  j=1,j 6=i  −pjβ(i)j pi  = n∑  j=k+1  pjβ (i) j  pi − εpi > 0 for all i = 1, . . . , k.  On account of Proposition 2.1, Ak(p) − εIk is a P -matrix and the result follows from Proposition 3.2 (b). 2  We now give a simplified version of the condition above which guarantees for (3.1) to have a unique solution.  Corollary 3.2. Suppose that there exists ε > 0 such that for every p ∈ K, we have  β(i)n pn > εp 2 i for all i = 1, . . . , n− 1.  Suppose also that Sn is strongly monotone. Then MVI (3.1) has a unique solution.  Proof. To prove the result it suffices fix k = n− 1 in Proposition 3.4. 2  Proposition 3.5. Suppose that there exist ε > 0 and an index k such that  n∑  j=k+1  β (i) j τ  ′  j > ετ ′′2 i for all i = 1, . . . , k.  If, in addition, Sj, j = k+1, . . . , n, are strongly monotone, then MVI (3.1) has a unique solution.  249    On a class of economic equilibrium problems  Proof. It follows from the definition of K that τ ′  i ≤ pi ≤ τ ′′  i . Hence, (3.4) implies  n∑  j=k+1  β (i) j τ  ′′  j > ετ ′2 i for all i = 1, . . . , k,  and the result follows from Proposition 3.4. 2  Corollary 3.3. Suppose that there exists ε > 0 such that  β(i)n τ ′  n > ετ ′′2 i for all i = 1, . . . , n− 1,  Suppose also that Sn is strongly monotone. Then MVI (3.1) has a unique solution.  Proof. To prove the result it suffices fix k = n− 1 in Proposition 3.5. 2  Again, if all the mappings Si, i = 1, . . . , n, are not strongly monotone, we can use their regularization. Note that the results of Propositions 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5 remain true if we replace the subset {1, . . . , k} with an arbitrary subset of {1, . . . , n}. Of course, all the considerations above, in particular, Corollaries 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 remain true if we replace n with an arbitrary number from {1, . . . , n}.  4 Numerical experiments  Properties obtained before enable us to find a solution of the economic equilibrium problem which was described in Section 3 with the help of the standard unconstrained differentiable optimization methods.  Let us consider the function  ϕα(x) = max y∈K  n∑  i=1  Φαi (x, yi) = n∑  i=1  max yi∈Ki  Φαi (x, yi), (4.1)  where  Φαi (x, yi) = Gi(x)(xi − yi)− 0.5α(xi − yi)2 + fi(xi)− fi(yi)  for i = 1, . . . , n;  250    E. Volotskaya  α > 0. The function Φαi (x, ·) is strongly concave, hence, there exist unique solutions to each inner problem in (4.1), i. e., there exist elements yαi (x) ∈ Ki such that  max yi∈Ki  Φαi (x, yi) = Φ α i (x, y  α i (x)) for i = 1, . . . , n.  Set yα(x) = (y α 1 (x), . . . , y  α n(x))  T . It is clear that yα(x) solves the problem  max y∈K  → 〈G(x), x− y〉 − 0.5α ‖x− y‖2 + f(x)− f(y)  for any fixed x. It follows from the results of [6] that MVI (3.1) reduces to the  problem of minimizing the gap function ϕα over K, i. e., (3.1) is equivalent to the problem  min x∈K → ϕα(x). (4.2)  Thus, in order to find a solution to MVI (3.1) it suffices to find a stationary point of problem (4.2), with ϕα being continuous and having bounded level sets. For instance, we can make use of any descent constrained minimization method; e. g., see [16]. However, since ϕα need not be differentiable it is not so easy to find such a suitable method for the general case. To overcome this drawback, we can use the D-gap function which enables us to convert MVI into a differentiable optimization problem. This approach for MVI of form (3.1) was developed in [5, 6].  Let us consider the function  ψαβ(x) = ϕα(x)− ϕβ(x),  where 0 < α < β. First we give several results from [6].  Proposition 4.1. (a) [6, Theorem 1] The function ψαβ is continuously differentiable, and  ∇ψαβ(x) = ∇G(x)[yβ(x)− yα(x)] + β(x− yβ(x))− α(x− yα(x)).  (b) [6, Theorem 2] Let ∇G(x) be a P -matrix for all x ∈ Rn. If ∇ψαβ(x∗) = 0, then ψαβ(x∗) = 0 and x∗ solves MVI (3.1).  251    On a class of economic equilibrium problems  In other words, if the Jacobian of the cost mapping G is a P matrix, the initial MVI (3.1) is equivalent to the problem of finding a stationary point of the continuosly differentiable function ψαβ . This latter problem can be solved by the standard unconstrained differentiable optimization methods, such as the steepest descent and conjugate gradient methods. Namely, we used the following three algorithms to minimize the function ψαβ .  Algorithm 1 (The steepest descent method (SDM) from [16]).  Let z0 ∈ K be any initial point, s ∈ (0, 1), p ∈ (0, 1), λ ≥ 1. At the k-th iteration, k = 0, 1, . . ., we have zk ∈ K.  Step 1. uk = zk − λ∇ψαβ(zk). Step 2. Compute the smallest nonnegative integer m satisfying  ψαβ(zk + p m(uk − zk)) ≤ ψαβ(zk)− spm ‖uk − zk‖2  Step 3. Set θk = p m, zk+1 = zk + θk(uk − zk), k = k + 1.  Algorithm 2 (The conjugate gradient method (CGM 1) from [17]).  Parameters. s ∈ (0, 1 2 ), v ∈ (0, 1), ω ∈ (0, 1), ε̃ > 0, Π2 ≥ Π1 > 0,  ρ > 0, δ̃ > 0, σ ∈ (0, 1), L > 0, k > 0. Remark. Experimentation is recommended for determining the  best values for these parameters.  Step 0. Select a reinitialization integer p ≥ n. Select an initial solution estimate z0 ∈ K. Set an iteration counter i = 0. Set δ̂ = δ̃. Set δ0 = δ̂.  Step 1. If ‖∇ψαβ(z0)‖ = 0, stop; else, set j = 0 and set d0 = −∇ψαβ(z0).  Step 2. Compute a scalar εi > 0 satisfying  Π1 ‖∇ψαβ(zi)‖ ≤ ‖εidi‖ ≤ Π2 ‖∇ψαβ(zi)‖ .  If εi > ε̃, set εi = ε̃. If ‖∇ψαβ(zi)‖ > kδ̂, set δ̂ = ‖∇ψαβ(zi)‖ /k. Step 3. If  ψαβ(zi + 2εidi)− 2ψαβ(zi + εidi) + ψαβ(zi) ≥ ε2i δ̂ ‖di‖ 2 ,  252    E. Volotskaya  then compute λi by the following formula:  λi = −ε2i∇ψαβ(zi)T di  ψαβ(zi + 2εidi)− 2ψαβ(zi + εidi) + ψαβ(zi) ;  else set δ̂ = σδ̂ and set λi = ρ. Step 4. Compute the smallest nonnegative integer k ≥ 0 satisfying  ψαβ(zi + λiv kdi)− ψαβ(zi) ≤ sλivk∇ψαβ(zi)T di  and set ki = k. Step 5. Set δi+1 = δ̂ and zi+1 = zi + λiv  kidi. Step 6. If ‖∇ψαβ(zi+1)‖ = 0, stop; else, go to step 7. Step 7. If j ≥ p, go to step 12; else go to step 8. Step 8. Compute γi by the following formula:  γi = −‖∇ψαβ(zi+1)‖2 ∇ψαβ(zi)T di  .  Step 9. If  ∇ψαβ(zi+1)T [−∇ψαβ(zi+1) + γidi] ≤ −ω ‖∇ψαβ(zi+1)‖2 ,  then go to step 10; else, go to step 12. Step 10. If  ‖−∇ψαβ(zi+1) + γidi‖ ≤ L, then go to step 11; else, go to step 12.  Step 11. Set j = j + 1 and set  di+1 = −∇ψαβ(zi+1) + γidi,  and go to step 13. Step 12. Set j = 0 and set  di+1 = −∇ψαβ(zi+1).  Step 13. Set i = i+ 1 and go to step 2. Making usual continuity assumptions on the function being mini mized, the following properties of the proposed algorithm were established in [17]). Without any convexity assumptions on the function  253    On a class of economic equilibrium problems  being minimized, the algorithm is globally convergent in the sense that every accumulation point of the generated sequences is a stationary point. Furthermore, when the generated sequeness converge to local minimum points satisfying second-order sufficient conditions for optimality, the algorithm eventually demands only one trial stepsize at each iteration, and it rate of convergence is n-step superlinear and n-step quadratic.  Algorithm 3 (The conjugate gradient method (CGM 2) from [18]).  Data. ρ2 > ρ1 > 0, γ > 0, σ ∈ (0, 1), δ2 > 1 > δ1 > 0, z0 ∈ K. Step 0. Set d0 = −∇ψαβ(z0) and k = 0. Step 1. If ∇ψαβ(zk) = 0 stop. Step 2. Set  τk =  ∣∣∇ψαβ(zk)T dk ∣∣  ‖dk‖2  and choose ∆k ∈ [ρ1τk, ρ2τk]. Step 3. Compute ζk = max  { σj∆k, j = 0, 1, . . .  } such that the  vectors zk+1 = zk + ζkdk and  dk+1 = −∇ψαβ(zk+1) + ∇ψαβ(zk+1)T (∇ψαβ(zk+1)−∇ψαβ(zk))  ‖∇ψαβ(zk)‖2 dk  satisfy the conditions:  (c1) ψαβ(zk+1) ≤ ψαβ(zk)− γζ2k ‖dk‖ 2 ;  (c2) −δ2 ‖∇ψαβ(zk+1)‖2 ≤ ∇ψαβ(zk+1)T dk+1  ≤ −δ1 ‖∇ψαβ(zk+1)‖2 . Set k = k + 1 and go to Step 1.  This line search algorithm ensures global convergence of the PolakRibiére conjugate gradient method for the unconstrained minimization of nonconvex differentiable function. In particular, with this line search every limit point produced by the Polak-Ribiére iteration is a stationary point of the objective function. Under strong convexity  254    E. Volotskaya  assumptions, the known global convergence results can be reobtained as a special case.  Numerical experiments were implemented with the following data.  Algorithm 1. s = 0.5, p = 0.9, λ = 3.  Algorithm 2. s = 0.4, v = 0.9, ω = 0.7, ε̃ = 2, Π2 = 10, Π1 = 2, ρ = 1, δ̃ = 3, σ = 0.8, L = 50, k = 3.  Algorithm 3. ρ2 = 2, ρ1 = 1, γ = 1, σ = 0.5, δ2 = 2, δ1 = 0.5.  Parameters for the function ψαβ were determined in the following manner α = 0.7, β = 1. The starting point was chosen to be z = (1, . . . , 1). Functions fi(p) were determined by the following formula:  fi(p) = max {ci1p+ di1, ci2p+ di2}  where  ci = (i,−i− 1), di = (−i− 2, i+ 3) for all i = 1, . . . , n.  Inventory of commodities was chosen with the help of the randomnumber generator on the interval (0, 10). Numerical experiments were implemented with using the following stopping criterion ‖∇ψαβ‖ < ε.  Two series experiments were implemented. In the first series of experiments an accuracy of solution was fixed to be ε = 0.01.  SDM CGM 1 CGM 2 Dim Niter T(sec.) Niter T(sec.)

Recently, the D-gap function approach for MVIs was developed in [5, 6]. It enables one to convert MVI (1.1) into the problem of finding a stationary point of a continuously differentiable function if G is so and satisfies P type properties. Therefore, one can apply the usual differentiable optimization methods to find equilibrium solution for this class of problems. From the results above it follows that the combination of conjugate gradient methods and D-gap function approach is effective procedure to find economic equilibrium.
