\begin{abstract}
We consider a set of two squares constructed for the primitive periods $1$ and
$i$ and having four vertices on one straight line. In a neighbourhood of this
set, we study a four-element difference equation with constant coefficients.
The linear shifts of this equation are the generating transformations of the
corresponding doubly periodic group and their inverse transformations. The
solution is sought in the class of functions that are analytic outside this set
and vanish at infinity. We give some applications to the moment problem for
entire functions of exponential type.
\end{abstract}

{\bf Keywords:} difference equations, method of regularisation, moment problem.

{\bf Introduction.} Let $D_1$ be a square with vertices $t_1=\lambda(1+i)$, \
$t_2=t_1+1$, \ $t_3=t_2+i$, \ $t_4=t_1+i$,  $\lambda>0$,  and sides $\ell_j$,
written as they are traversed along the positively oriented boundary
$\Gamma_1=\partial D_1$ $(t\in\ell_1 \Rightarrow  \  {\rm Im} \,t=\lambda)$.
Consider also the square $D_2=-D_1$. Denote its sides by $\ell\,'_j$
$\left(t\in \ell\,'_1 \Rightarrow {\rm Im}\, t=-\lambda-1 \right).$ The
generating transformations of the corresponding doubly periodic group and their
inverse transformations will be written as $\sigma_m(z)=z+i^m$,
$m=\overline{1,4}$. They map the interior of any square to its exterior. Assume
that $D=D_1\cup  D_2$, $\Gamma=\Gamma_1\cup \Gamma_2$.

We will study the linear difference equation (l.d.e.) %% {linear recurrence equation?}
$$
\left(V  f \right) (z)\equiv \sum\limits _{m=1}^{4}  (-1)^m  f\left[\sigma_m(z) \right]=g(z), \ z\in D \eqno{(1)}
$$
under the following assumptions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The solution will be sought in the class of functions $f(z)$ that are
    holomorphic in the complement of the set $D$ and vanish at infinity.
    The boundary values $f^-(t)$ should satisfy the H\"{o}lder condition on
    each open side of the squares. At the vertices, there may be
    singularities of, at most, logarithmic type. %% {At the vertices, there may be singularities, logarithmic at most?}

\item The independent term $g(z)=g_k(z)$, $z\in D_k$, $k=\overline{1,2}$,
    is piecewise holomorphic in $D$ (i.\,e. holomorphic in each $D_k$) and
    its boundary values $g^+_k(t)\in H(\Gamma_k)$.
\end{enumerate}

We denote by $B$ the class of such solutions. Under these assumptions, the
non-connectivity of the set $C\setminus Q$, with $Q=\bigcup\limits_{k=1}^{2}
Q_k$, where $Q_k=\bigcup\limits_{m=1}^{4} \sigma_m(D_k)$, is the most important
factor, which completely determines the structure of the research. This set
splits into three connected components, and only one of them contains the point
at infinity. At the same time, Equation (1) is defined in the other two
components, which makes it impossible to apply to it the powerful classical
methods of research of convolution operators [1]. For this reason, here the
solution and the independent term belong in the general case to different
classes of holomorphic functions, which makes it different from the standard
approach to the theory of analytic solutions of l.d.e. In particular, the
independent term must not be analytically continuable across some interval
$\Gamma_k$. Even in the case of an homogeneous equation
$$
\left(V f \right)(z)=0, \quad z\in D, \eqno{(2)}
$$
we cannot in general conclude that it holds in a certain neighbourhood of
infinity. The need for additional restrictions on the nature of the boundary
values of the solution to the studied equations is determined by the essence of
the matter (a detailed commentary can be found in [2, p. 551] and in the
introduction to [3]).

That approach to l.d.e.\@ was first suggested in [4] in the case of a single
square. Subsequently, the task was generalised in various directions, including
the case of variable coefficients that are holomorphic in $D$ [5, 6]. Some
applications arising from this approach were considered in [7, 8]. The case
when those equations are defined on several squares was studied for the first
time in [2], where it was assumed that the squares are so ``far distant'' from
each other that the set  $Q_1\bigcap Q_2=\varnothing $  for $j_1\ne j_2$. We
therefore suppose here that $\lambda\in (0, 2^{-1})$.

Finally, we will dwell on the results of the article [9], where Equation (1)
was studied in the case $D_2=D_1+\alpha$, $\alpha\in(2,3)$. Note that the
problem becomes meaningless %% {loses its meaning}
when $\alpha\in(0,2)$ since in this case some transformations of the group map
the interior of one square to the interior of the other square, where the
solution $f(z)$ is not defined.

We consider a problem that differs essentially from the one studied in [9].
Firstly, the positive number $\mathop{\mathrm{dist}}\left( \Gamma_1,
\Gamma_2\right) $ may be arbitrarily small. %% {as small as we wish}
Secondly, the set $Q_0=Q_1\bigcap Q_2$ in [9] is a rectangle; here we assume
that this set is disconnected. It splits into two squares, thus giving a
different kind of power problem of moments for entire functions of exponential
type (e.f.e.t.).

This article consists of three sections. In \S\,1, we perform an equivalent
regularisation of problem (1). In \S\,2, we prove that the problem is
unconditionally solvable if $\lambda\in\left(3^{-1},2^{-1}\right)$. In \S\,3,
we consider applications to the moment problem for e.f.e.t.

{\bf \S 1.} We seek a solution to problem (1) in the form of a Cauchy-type
integral:
$$
f(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int\limits_{\Gamma} \left(\tau-z \right)^{-1}\varphi(\tau)\, d\tau, \quad
z \notin  \overline{D} \eqno(3)
$$

Consider a piecewise constant $\theta_t=(-1)^j,$ $t\in\ell_j\cup \ell\,'_j$.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that
$$
\varphi(t)=-\theta_t\ \varphi[\alpha(t)]. \eqno{(4)}
$$

Here $\alpha(t)=t+i^j,$   $t\in\ell_j\cup\ell\,'_j,$ $j=\overline{1,4}$, is a
Carleman shift induced on each contour $\Gamma_k$ by the transformations
$\sigma_m(z)$. Indeed, integral (3) does not change if one replaces its density
on any contour $\Gamma_k$ with  $\varphi(\tau)+a^+_k(\tau)$, where $a_k(z)$ is
a holomorphic function in $D_k$.

We consider (4) as a special case of the Carleman problem for a rectangle (see
[10]) with unknown function  $a_k(z)$. This problem is unconditionally
solvable. Taking into account expression (3), we obtain
$$
(1) \Leftrightarrow \left(A\varphi \right)(z)\equiv\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int\limits_\Gamma\varphi(\tau) E(\tau-z)\,d\tau=g(z),  \ z\in D, \eqno{(5)}
$$
where the kernel function
$$
E(u)=\left(u+1 \right)^{-1}+\left(u-1 \right)^{-1}-\left(u+i \right)^{-1}-\left(u-i \right)^{-1}. \eqno{(6)}
$$

Let us regularise Equation (1). With (4) in mind, we obtain
$$
\left(A^+\varphi \right) (t)=2^{-1}\varphi(t)+ \left(A\varphi \right) (t),  \eqno{(7)}
$$
where the integral operator is produced by the formal substitution of $z\in D$
with  $t\in\Gamma$ and is understood in the sense of the Cauchy principal
value. Replace in (7) the variable $t$ with $\alpha(t)$, multiply it by
$\theta_t$, and subtract the obtained equality from the original one. Then,
taking into account (5), we have
$$
\left(T\varphi \right)(t)\equiv \varphi(t)+\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int\limits_\Gamma\varphi(\tau) K(t,\tau) d \tau=g^+(t)-\theta_t g^+[(\alpha(t))],   \eqno{(8)}
$$
where
$$
K(t,\tau)=E(\tau-t)-\theta_t\theta_\tau E\left(
\alpha(\tau)-\alpha(t)\right). \eqno{(9)}
$$

{\bf Lemma 1.}  Kernel (9) is bounded.

{\bf Proof.} The proof reduces to a direct examination of different
dispositions of the points $\tau$ and $t$ on the sides of the squares.

{\bf Theorem 1.} L.d.e.\@ (1) has at most a finite number of solvability
conditions. All of them are solvability conditions of the Fredholm integral
equation (8).

{\bf Proof.} If Equation (8) is solvable, then it has a solution that satisfies
(4) (see [11]). Thus
$$
(8) \ \Rightarrow\left( A^+\varphi\right)(t)-\theta_t\left( A^+\varphi\right)\left(\alpha(t) \right)=g^+(t)-\theta_t g^+\left[\alpha(t) \right].
$$
And since the homogeneous Carleman problem $a^+(t)=\theta_t
a^+\left[\alpha(t)\right]$ has only the trivial solution, we can conclude that
$(8)\Rrightarrow (1)$. This completes the proof.

{\bf \S 2.} We assume now that  $\lambda\in \left(3^{-1}, 2^{-1} \right). $
Consider the homogeneous equation
$$
T\varphi=0 \ . \eqno{(10)}
$$
It is obvious that $(10) \ \Leftrightarrow \left(T\varphi \right)(-t)=0.$ To
make this conclusion, it is enough to replace in (10) the variables $\tau$ and
$t$ respectively with $-\tau$ and $-t$, taking into account that
$\alpha(-t)=-\alpha(t).$ Kernel (9) is antisymmetric. The adjoint equation has
therefore the form
$$
\left(T'\psi\right)(t)\equiv\psi(t)-\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int\limits_\Gamma\varphi(\tau) K(t,\tau)\,d\tau=0. \eqno{(11)}
$$
The fundamental system of solutions (f.s.s.) of Equation (10) or (11) can be
taken in such a way that each function belonging to it satisfies either
condition (4) or the opposite condition
$$
\psi(t)=\theta_t\psi\left[\alpha(t)\right]  . \eqno{(12)}
$$

The solvability conditions of the inhomogeneous Fredholm equation (8) can be
obtained by taking into account only the solutions of the adjoint equation that
have the property (12), since the solutions with property (4) are orthogonal to
the right member of Equation (8).

{\bf Lemma 1.}  The f.s.s.\@ of the adjoint equation (11) does not contain any
function with property (12).

{\bf Proof.} Assume that $M=\max\left\lbrace |\psi(t)|,
t\in\Gamma\right\rbrace$. By virtue of condition (12), the symmetry, and the
parity (evenness or oddness) of the function $\psi(t)$, we can assume without
loss of generality that $t\in\ell_1$. We also assume that $\lambda=3^{-1}$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[1)] $\tau\in\ell_1\cup\ell\,'_1 \ \Rightarrow \  K(t,\tau)=0.$

\item[2)]  $\tau\in\ell_3$.  Then $\tau-t=i+\gamma $,
    $\alpha(\tau)-\alpha(t)=\gamma-i$, with $\gamma\in[-1,1] \\ \Rightarrow
    K(t,\tau)=4i\varphi(x),$ where
    $\varphi(x)=(x+4)^{-1}-(x+2)(x^2+4)^{-1}$ and $x=\gamma^2.$ Therefore
    $\left|K(t,\tau) \right|\le 1{,}6.$

\item[3)] $\tau\in\ell\,'_3 \ \Rightarrow \left|K(t,\tau)
    \right|=\left|\left(u+i \right)^{-1}- \left(u-1 \right)^{-1}-\left(u+1
    \right)^{-1}-\left(u-3i \right)^{-1} +\right.$ \\ $\left.+\left(u-1-2i
    \right)^{-1}+\left(u+1-2i \right)^{-1}\right| \le 2,13. $ Here
    $u=\tau-t.$

\item[4)] $\tau\in\ell_2\cup\ell_4$. Since
    $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{2}\int\limits_{\ell_{2k}} \varphi(\tau) K(t,\tau)\,
    d\tau=\int\limits_{\ell_4} \varphi(\tau) K_1(t,\tau)\,d\tau,$ we will
    find an upper bound for the absolute value of the kernel
    $K_1(t,\tau)=K(t,\tau)-K(t,\alpha(\tau))$. Thus,
    $\left|K_1\right|=\left| \left(u+i \right)^{-1}-\left(u-i
    \right)^{-1}+\right.$ $+\left(u+1-2i \right)^{-1}-\left(u+2-i
    \right)^{-1}-\left(u+i +1\right)^{-1}+\left(u+2 \right)^{-1}-\left(u-2i
    \right)^{-1}+$ $\displaystyle\left.+\left(u-1-i \right)^{-1}\right| \le
    \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.$

\item[5)]  $\tau\in\ell\,'_2\cup\ell\,'_4$. If $\tau\in\ell\,'_4$, then we
    have $\left|K_1(t,\tau) \right|\le 1{,}8.$
\end{enumerate}

Since  $1{,}6+2{,}13+\sqrt{3}/2+1{,}8<2\pi$, we obtain $\psi\equiv 0$. This
finishes the proof of the lemma.

{\bf Note 1.}  If $\lambda>3^{-1}$, then estimates 3) and 5) only become
better, which means that the lemma remains valid in this case. Inequalities 2)
and 3) do not depend on $\lambda$.

{\bf Note 2.} It is possible to show that the f.s.s.\@ of Equations (11) and
(12) are empty if $\lambda\le 3^{-1}$. We do not give the proof here since the
estimates involved are quite cumbersome, and the result is not used in the rest
of this study.

{\bf  Theorem 2.} Problem (1) is solvable and has a unique solution. The
homogeneous problem (2) has only the trivial solution.

{\bf \S 3.} One of the squares the set $Q_0$ splits into is a square $\Delta_1$
with vertices $\lambda(i-1)$, $i(1-\lambda)-\lambda$, $(1-\lambda)i-1+\lambda,$
$\lambda-1+\lambda i$. The second one is the square $\Delta_2=-\Delta_1  \
\Leftrightarrow \ \Delta_2=\Delta_1+1-i$. Assume that $z\in\Delta_1$  and
$b(z)=f(z)-f(z+1-i)$. Then, taking into account (1), this expression can be
transformed in two ways. On the one hand, $b(z)=g(z+1)-f(z+2)+f(z+1+i).$ On the
other hand, $b(z)=f(z-1-i)-f(z-2i)-g_2(z-i)$. Equating both expressions, we
obtain $f(z+2)-f(z+1+i)-f(z-1-i)+f(z-2i)=g_0(z),$ $z\in\Delta_1$, where
$g_0(z)=g_1(z+1)+g_2(z-i)$. Take the point $z_0=2^{-1}(i-1)$, the centre of the
square $\Delta_1.$ Assume that
$$
g_0(z)=\sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{\beta_k(z-z_0)^k}{k!},
$$
and the convergence radius  of the series satisfies the inequality $R\le
\left(1-2\lambda \right) \sqrt{2}/2. $ Using the Borel transform (see [12,
ch.\,1]), we get
$$
\int\limits_0^\infty  F(x)  \exp\left( -x(z+2)\right)\,dx-
 \int\limits_{-\infty}^0  F(x)  \exp\left( -x(z-1-i)\right)\,dx +{}
$$
$$
+\int\limits_{\theta_2} F(\tau) \exp\left(-\tau(z-z_0) \right)\,d\tau=g_0(z), \
z\in\Delta_1.
$$
Here the ray $\displaystyle \theta_k=\frac{\pi}{2} (-1)^k,$ $k=1,2.$ Note that
the conjugate indicator diagram of the e.f.e.t.\@ $F(z)$, which is
Borel-associated with the lower function $f(z)\in B,$ is, generally speaking, a
hexagon $D$ with vertices  $\pm t_2$, $\pm t_3$, $\pm t_4$. Equating the Taylor
coefficients in the last equality at the point $z_0$, we get
$$
\int\limits_0^\infty  F(x) x^k \exp\left( -x(z_0+2)\right)\,dx-
 \int\limits_{\theta_1}  F(\tau) \tau^k  \exp\left( \tau(z_0+1+i)\right)\,d\tau-{}
$$
$$
-\int\limits_{-\infty}^0 F(x) x^k \exp\left(-x(z_0-1-i) \right)\,dx+
\int\limits_{\theta_2} F(\tau) \tau^k \exp\left(-\tau(z-2i) \right)\,d\tau =\beta_k (-1)^k. \eqno(13)
$$

{\bf  Theorem 3.} Moment problem (13) is solvable in the class of e.f.e.t.\@
$F(z)$ that are Borel-associated with the lower function $f(z)\in B$ and its
solution is unique.

{\bf Note 3.} It is possible (albeit of little interest) the case when the
conjugate indicator diagram is a ``smaller'' convex set $D''\subset D'$. For
this, it is necessary (but not sufficient) that at least one of the functions
$g_k (z)$ could be analytically continued from $D_k''$ to some neighbourhood of
the point at infinity, and $ g_k(\infty) = 0$. See Note 2 in [9] for more
details.
