double scaling splashes s a chumachenko 1 1 chumachenkosergei gmail com the saratov national research state university considers a new class of basic scales which are multiple integrating walsha s function it is proven that these sets are a solution to the scalable equation the obvious type of this scalating equation is indicated keywords binary basic splashes a scaling equation let i f x x 0 f t d t x 0 1 the integration operator w 2 n 1 x the functions of the walsh determination 1 function ement x 4 i nw 2 n 1 2 n x x 0 2 n will be called binary basic splash of the nth degree in 1 it was proved that the compression and shift system built on the basis of the function eed x is the basis in space c 0 0 1 and is fairly inequality f x s 2 n j x f 1 2 n 2 2 f 1 2 n 2 where s 2 n j x is the value of partial amounts at point x f 2 f the continuity of the first and second order the theorem about the scaling equation the following equality is true wor x 1 2 m wor 2 x 0 2 m 1 t 1 1 2 m 1 wor 2 x t 1 2 m wor 2 x 2 m the work is performed with financial support of the russian federation project 16 01 00152 literature 1 chumachenko s aos of one of the analogues of the faiber shauder system kazan proceedings of the mathematical center named after n i lobachevsky 2016 t 53 c 163 2 kashin b s sahakyan a a orthogonalny rows m acf 1999 550 c 3 aubakirov t u bokaev n a on the new class of functions of the faber shauder type mat notes 2007 t 82 no 5 c 643 binary refinement spline functions s a chumachenko we define binary basic splines of natural order and obtain a refinement equation for this splines keywords binary basic spline refinement equation
