the coefficient conditions of the trigonometric row convergence on average let the appropriate trigonometric series happen et least cne inx 1 as usual we will use the designations sn x n k n cke ikx n x 1 n 1 n k 0 sk x for all n 0 it is known that if the private sums of sn converge limited in the metric l then 1 2 2 0 n x sn x dx o 1 respectively o 1 2 36 is due if the row 1 is near the fourier then the condition 2 follows the convergence limited in the metric l of the private sums of the row 1 in the hackers of the species 2 we believe of course that n strives for icles in the report it is appreciated to discuss the abilities associated with the next four theraps theorem 1 1 if the condition 2 is fulfilled then 2 n k n 2 ck c k k n 1 o 1 respectively o 1 3 2 if for some 0 1 and the whole number m 6 0 the condition ln n 1 max j 1 n cn cn is completed jm o 1 respectively o 1 then from the condition 2 and even more so from the condition 3 the condition cn cn ln n o 1 respectively o 1 4 it turns out that for some common rows of species 1 the theorem 1 can be used to be used to the sequence of nature number nn inous 1 will say that it is like fl if it is also for a certain nature of p it satisfies the condition of the inf nn p nn n 1 1 the sequence of actual numbers an mmn 1 is a sequence of the type k 1 if there are such fl sequence nn mmn 1 and the number a 1 which each inhibitory k finds the urgent functions wor n k n and the sign sk 1 for which an sk accord n k n of all n nk 1 1 nk n does not decrease k n does not renounce either wor nk auction nk 1 1 or k nk 1 1 a k nk squeezed an mmn 1 we call a sequence of type k 2 if there are such fl sequence nn inous 1 the fire sequence of the actual numbers k k 1 37 and the whole m 0 which is for each nature of there is a polynomial pk degree not higher than m for which an pk n n k is all n nk 1 1 nk if there are such positive numbers and that nk nk 1 n k we will say that an mmn 1 of the type k 3 exist theorem 2 if each of the sequences re cn n 1 im cn ger 1 re c n mmn 1 im c n 1 5 type k 1 or k 2 then for a series 1 the conditions 2 and 3 are equivalent moreover if each of the sequences 5 type k 3 then conditions 2 3 and 4 are equivalent a special case of theory 2 for the rows of fourier when the coefficients of quasimonotonna was obtained by s a telyakovsky and g a fomin 1975 and the case when m 0 all k 0 and sequence nn mmn 1 lacunapna was received by s a taljakovsky 1991 note that we will have a condition 2 for the pro russian trigonometric rows and not only for the rows of fourier theorem 3 let n 1 a sequence of positive numbers that is proceeding to least then you can post such a series of fourier species 1 with unlimited metric l by private amounts that cn cn 1 c n c n 1 ln n 1 n n for all n 1 and a perpetual condition 4 is fulfilled theorem 3 shows that the next theorem 4 if a certain natural m is the condition cn cn m c n c n m o ln n 1 n then for a series 1 conditions 2 3 and 4 are equivalent 38
