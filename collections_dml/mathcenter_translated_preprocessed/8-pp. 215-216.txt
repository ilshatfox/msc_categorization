the numerically analytical solution of the bigarmonic equation is considered the marginal problem for the bargarmonic function in the multi link area it is known that the bigarmonic function can be expressed through two analytical functions that can be found by well known methods of analytical functions in particular in the case of double areas to solve the problem you can use a conformal display on the ring of the parametric plane and look for analytical functions in the form of a series of taylor two ways to determine the coefficients of the series are proposed 1 comparing the coefficients with the same trigonometric functions and 2 satisfaction with the boundary conditions at separate points collocation method the first method allows in some cases to get an analytical solution the second is to develop a numerical calculation algorithm for quite complex tasks numerical examples confirm the satisfactory coincidence of both methods for areas with arbitrary but non overstraining boundaries a numerical algorithm is developed based on the use of the method of boundary elements to the integral equation for the bigarmonic function 1 the task comes down to solving a system of linear equations the method can be applied to the numerical solution of the bigarmonic equation in the multi link area as an application the movement of bodies of various configurations in a limited maximum viscous fluid is considered 2 215 l and t r a t r a 1 elliot l ingham d b el bashir t b a the boundary element method for the slow problems for which a paradoxical sitation arises proc int conf bem in fluid dynamics ii southampton uk 1994 p 3 10 2 terentyev a g the movement of the cylinder in the maximum viscous limited fluid tr matte center named after n i lobachevsky t 7 kazan publishing house das 2000 s 246 259 n t tleukhanova karaganda kazakhstan on the transformation of hardy and bellman for the orthogonal rows of fourier orthonomated system k x k 1 let s call regular a constant b which 1 for any segment e from 0 1 and k n e k x dx b min e 1 k 2 for any segment w final arithmetic progression with step 1 from n and t 0 1 k etk f t b min w 1 t where k etk f t non growing rearrangement of the function korn k x w the number of elements in the set w let is a regular orthonomated system i ik k organ a certain sequence of the final subset from n through j we denote the sequence of sets jk k organ where jk m k im for f l 1 0 1 f n k 1 ak accord x and sequence i ik k organize the transformation 216
