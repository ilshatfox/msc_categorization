multipliers and functionality of one dimensional f algebra n log n multidimensional f albur n logomed functions in the ball and polydiska is considered in 1 as a replenishment by invariant metric 1 of the association of multidimensional f algebr i i privalov previously studied in 5 this article establishes that in a one dimensional case when the ball and polydis pass into the circle on the complex plane the scheme developed in 7 and 2 for some spaces containing n log n is applicable to the n log n space which allows us to fully allows describe linear continuous functionality in n log n and coefficient multipliers from n log n into the hardy hp p 0 the results are used to establish accuracy of the estimates of uniform growth of functions from n log n and their taylor coefficients as well as to identify some topological properties space n log n and fresche spaces covering it 1 preliminary information we denote the circle z 1 on a complex z plain symbol u and its border z 1 symbol t according to 1 the holomorphic in the function f belongs to the class n log ng if sup 06 r 1 log 1 f reiaw d 2 where t t log e t t 0 in 1 inclusions hp n q n log n n n n n p 0 q 1 with which the class n log n is associated with the classes of hard hp p 0 privalov n q q 1 see 3 smirnova n nevanlinn nvanlinn n 4 and class m introduced in the 97 th one case in 2 from where in particular see 4 the existence of the radial boundary limits f ei limr 1 f rei each function f n log n for almost all ei step t b 1 in class n log n is introduced invariant metric in the form f g f g f g n log n where f log 1 f ei d 2 f n log n 1 and the properties of class n log n are investigated as a functional space from which we will need the next two theorem a class n log n forms f spaces regarding metric disinfection in the metrics is not weaker uniform convergence on the computer ktah in u and for any function f of class n log n the function fr 0 6 r 1 determined by equations of fr z f rz z u converge at r 1 to the initial function f in metric the theorem b for the arbitrary function f of class n log n they are fairly uniform in assessment logs 1 f reiison 6 1 f 1 r 1 r 1 0 6 r 1 2 and log 1 f reiaw o 1 r 1 r 1 for r 1 3 in which the symbol 1 denotes the function in the of the function 2 evaluation of the coefficients of the taylor functions of the class n log n the purpose of this paragraph is to proof of the following assessment of the coefficients of taylor of the functions of the class n log n theorem 1 for the coefficients of the taylor functions of the space n log n an asymptotic assessment of log an o n log e n with n 4 proof let the holomorphic in the circle of the function f satisfies the condition of the log 1 m f r 6 1 1 r 1 r 1 with r 0 6 r 1 5 for some for some 0 and 0 6 r 0 1 where m f r max z r f z 6 98 and 1 denotes a function reverse to the function t t log e t t 0 according to koshi inequalities for the coefficients of taylor functions f are valuable log an 6 log m f r n log r 0 r 1 n z hence the log an 6 1 1 r 1 r 1 n log r 0 r 1 n z 7 we minimize the expression on the right in order equating the components of the compliance with each other 1 1 r 1 r 1 n log 1 r 8 this equation at the interval 0 1 has the only root r rn and it is easy to notice that rn 1 at n using the known equivalence we see that 1 1 rn 1 rn 2 1 rn log e 2 1 rn 2 1 rn log e 1 1 rn and n log 1 rn n 1 rn with n 9 from here and from equality 8 with r rn we get 2 1 rn 1 log e 1 1 rn n 1 rn or 1 rn 2 log e 1 1 rn n 2 for n since the function opposite to the function s t 2 log e t t 0 is equivalent to s ger functions s log e s then 1 rn 1 n log e n 2 2 or 1 rn 2 n log e n with n so substituting the value of r rn into the inequality taking into account the equivalent 9 and the fact that both are composed in inequality 7 are equal we get log an 6 bn 2 2 n log e n at n 10 if the function f belongs to the n log n class then for it is fair theorem b log 1 m f r o 1 r 1 r 1 99 for r 1 therefore constant in the assessment 5 can be chosen as an arbitrarily small positive value from inequality 10 then it should be that log an o n log e n with n which was required to prove 3 coefficient multipliers from n log n to hp p 0 let f and h two many holomorphic functions in the circle u the numerical sequence bn n organo is called the coefficient multiplier from f h if for any function f f with the decomposition f z ger n 0 anz n z u 11 there is a function h h once
