the study of the bending of round and ring plates according to the theories of reissner a and kirchhof agapova yu v nizhny novgorod state university work is devoted to the calculation of records of two types a continuous round step up thickness and ring constant thickness the plate is bended by the transverse load q r b t cosnb g in polar coordinates and efforts applied along the contour when solving the problem by the analytical method the round plate of a step to stand thickness is divided into two parts concentric circle and ring each of them has a load that has its own distribution law the calculation is based on the updated theory of reissner learning the influence of a shift on a bend the calculation of the task is carried out by the analytical method the solution of the main differential equations consists of a common amount containing arbitrary integration constants and a private one depending on the overhead load an algorithm has been developed on the basis of which the fortran language for ivm ivm compiled a program that allows based on the boundary conditions to compile a system of equations for setting arbitrary permanent integration solve this system 78
