parametric resonance for bending circular fluctuations in the b affane 1 1 boudkhil affane gmail com kazan volga federal university institute of mathematics and mechanics n i lobachevsky article is devoted to the study of the parametric resonance of the steeply oscillations of the console plates arising from bending vibrations the work is searching for parametric resonance windows of steep fluctuations for the first two mods of bending windows of parametric resonance of steep vibrations are built keywords bending vibrations steep fluctuations parametric resonance the introduction of console fixed rod type plates in which the thickness h width b and length l are such that h b l are used in particular in determining the logarithmic decrement of oscillations ldcs of the material on the basis of the study of fading bending vibrations of test figures according to the first main fashion taking into account aerodynamic damping 2 3 however when determining ldk materials based on a study of the forced fluctuations of test figures by the second forms of bending oscillations along with the fixed bending vibrations high frequency steep fluctuations are also observed for the correct description of these mechanical effects the basis of the basic equations of movement we put the specified geometrically nonlinear equations of oscillations of the elongated plates proposed in the work 1 for simplicity equations 1 are analyzed in neglect of damping internal and external the model predicts the excitation of steep fluctuations kc of the plate due to parametric resonance in the presence of highly amplitude bending vibrations ir in this work the task of theoretical study of this phenomenon is set to build windows of the parametric resonance of the kk the task boils down to solving the endless chain of ordinary differential equations with periodic coefficients this chain is being covered and the multipliers of the truncated system are determined and determined for the first two mods of ir the parametric resonance windows of steep vibrations are built it is shown that with typical parameters for the main fashion of the ic of the resonance window it is extremely narrow due to which the fixation of the growth of the cc is not possible on the existing experimental equipment the situation is different for the second fashion here parametric resonance windows are more clearly manifested and the task of their experimental detection 20 lobachev readings 2019 can be set fig 1 designations in the task of vibration of the plate setting the specified model 1 which
