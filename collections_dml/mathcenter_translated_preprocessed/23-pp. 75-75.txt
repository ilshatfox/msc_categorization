mutual genericiry this is joint work with dietrich kuske of dresden university we study generic automorphisms of three particular homogeneous structures the rationals as an ordered set the countable universal homogeneous partial order and the random graph two of these cases were discussed in an earlier paper of the same authors where it was shown that there is a generic automorphism of the second in a sense introduced by truss an automorphism is generic in this sense if it lies in a comeagre conjugacy class in this talk i shall discuss the existence of mutually generic automorphisms and give three possible definitions of what this could mean 77
