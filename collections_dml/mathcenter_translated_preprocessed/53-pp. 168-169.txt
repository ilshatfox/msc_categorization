determination of seismic signals using vyvyl analysis signals processing using veillet analysis found its application in many areas starting from the creation of the musical tracks and ending with the processing of seismic waves in the study of oil and gas deposits 1 2 below the races is the next task let there be a signal of the provision obtained during the exploration of the field and the database of rocky signature scalograms qi i n it is required to find such a signal in which is close to the source signal by the selected metric with a given accuracy note that the climax is called the function of the species cm 3 s ai bj wa ai bj 2 the method of analysis and comparison of seismic sigs with template signals from the base based on the use of their climbers is proposed the algorithm for comparing the obtained seismic signal f x y with a signal shabet from the database of template seismic signals is based on the method of searching for the image according to the template cm 4 the initial signal f x y lays out by the owl basis standard quantum operations truncation and sorting of coefficients are performed the comparison algorithm can be divided into steps step 1 calculation of a climb for a check signal step 2 graphic image of the rock a m shamsiev 169 step 3 weevlet transforming a climb step 4 truncation and quantization of the obtained owltetrochefficants step 5 finding in the database of climbers of a close climb using the selected metric a modernized algorithm for analyzing a seismic signal based on the method 5 known as shazam has also been proposed the algorithm for comparing the initial seismic signal and the signal shablon is implemented in the programming language c the wave class was created capable of improving seismic signals as well as perform the operating quantizing and sorting of the indulgence coefficients the work was carried out with financial support from the rffi about the ect no 15 07 05380 l and tr t r a 1 mallas veillets in signal processing per from english m mir 2005 671 p 2 kellerw wavelets in geodesy and geodynamics walter de gruyter gmbh and co kg 2004 277 p 3 vityazevv v ilovet analysis of time series textbook by souve st petersburg publishing house of the st petersburg university 2001 58 p 4 stage dorouzt salezind veillets in computers thermal graphics per from english izhevsk nic regular and chaotic dynamics 2002 272 p 5 wangavery li chun an industrial strength audio search algorithm shazam entertainment 2002 c 1 7
