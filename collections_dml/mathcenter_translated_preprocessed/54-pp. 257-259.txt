construction of general solution of second order ordinary differential equation with a variable changing signefficent n v martemyanova while solving inverse problems for a degenerate mixed type equation we obtain a inhomogened ordinary equation with a variable chaning signefficient we constructor general solution of this equation and prove some its properties keywords inhomogeneous ordinary differential equation with a variable changing sign coeffic general solution particular solution udc 517 53 on the best approximation of the degree function in the space of bergman v p misyuk 1 1 misiuk grsu by grodno state university named after yankees kupala grodno belarus in the article considers the question of the best approximation of the degree function in the space of bergman key words the best polynomial approximation direct theorems bergman s space let s the hidden of the jordan simple or closed curve in the complex plane c for 0 p mm we denote the space of the lebe of the integrated on s relative the linear measure of the lebe with the usual quasinore lp s the norm at 1 p least namely f lp s if f p f lp s d f p d 1 p mm at 0 p mm f f l least s sup eed f mm with p urb according to the definition of 1 3 the function f the analytical in the circle d z c z 1 belongs to the space of hardy hp 0 p main if the quasinorm is finite f hp sup rative 0 1 f lp sr where sr is the circumference ctor r as you know for almost all d the function f z z d has non cupual limiting values thus the function f hp is determined not only in d but also almost everywhere on d the border d it turns out that f hp f lp d 258 materials of the international school conference let pn many algebraic polynomials of the degree no higher than n for the function f hp we enter en f p inf pn et wood f pn hp n 0 1 2 the best approximation f by means of the set pn in the theory of polynomial approximations the following implication the so called jackson type theorem is well known is well known for hp en f p c ns f s hp at n s 1 where c 0 and depends only on p and s and f s the derivative s n functions f in the case of 1 p ear the ratio 1 is proved similarly to the jackson theorem for periodic functions 5 further e a storozhenko 4 gives an analogue of jackson s first theorem for hp spaces at 0 p 1 for first order continuity modules and conducts a generalization in case of modules of smoothness of arbitrary order 6 for r z we introduce the function f z 1 z where the main branch is taken in the region 1 urb from the implication 1 we immediately obtain that with n the weak equivalence en f p n 1 p 1 p urb z 2 in case of a flat measure of the lebag rather deep studies were not conducted in this direction however it can be noted that in 1961 s ya alper 7 studied issues related to the approximation of analytical functions on average in particular he received an analogue of inequality 1 under conditions s 0 p 1 generalization 1 for other parameter values in case of a flat measure were obtained author 8 let m 2 be a flat measure of the lebeg through ap ap d 0 p least we denote the space of the begman 1 analytical functions f in d endowed with the final quasinorm f ap f lp d the norm at 1 p icle relative to a flat measure lebbeg namely f ap f lp d d f hole p dm 2 hole 1 p p mm f aurb f l least d sup ther f answers mm with p inous it is clear that the spaces of horry and aives coincide therefore then we consider the case 0 p mm for f ap d we enter en f ap inf pnphn f pn ap d n 0 1 2 1 sometimes this space is called the space of mm drzhbashyan v r misyuk 259 is the best approximation of function f in space ap by means of a set pn the next result 8 can be considered as an appropriate jackson type theorem for ap s ion and f s ap d 0 p mm then en f ap c ns f s ap n s s 1 3 where c 0 and does not depend on f and n based on the ratio 3 we have shown that weak equivalence 2 for n will accept the type en f p n 2 p 2 p urb z the work was carried out with financial support for the state research program conversation 2020 literature 1 privalov i i the boundary properties of analytical functions m l gittl 1950 431 p 2 kusis p introduction to the theory of spaces h p m mir 1984 368 p 3 garnett j limited analytical functions m mir 1984 469 p 4 storozhenko e a approach of the functions of the class hp 0 p 1 mat collection 1978 t 105 147 no 4 c 600 621 5 timan a f theory of approximations of the functions of the actual alternating m gifml 1960 624 p 6 storozhenko e a about prib
