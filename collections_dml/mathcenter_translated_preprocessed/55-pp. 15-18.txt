the correct formulation of general boundary value problems for conditionally well posed integro differential equations of fredholm volterra j r agachev m yu pershagin in this paper we investigate the general boundary value problem for linear integrodifferential equations of fredholm volterra specified on a segment of the number line where the order of the internal differential operators is higher than that of the corresponding exterior differential operator we prove well posedness of this problem in the hadamard sense in a specially selected pair of non weighted sobolev spaces keywords sobolev space integro differential equation general boundary value problem wellposedness 517 928 1 1 aina 2100 yandex ru samara national research university named after academician s p 1 16 2 1 2 d d exp 1 1 r 1 1 dr 3 d 1 2 r 2 d d 1 1 exp 1 1 r 3 r 1 2 1 3 0 1 r 1 1 3 1 ln 1 1 2 r 3 1 0 4 1 3 d d 1 ln 1 1 2 r 3 1 exp 1 1 r 1 5 dr 3 d 1 2 r 6 1 1 1 2 3 4 17 for this
