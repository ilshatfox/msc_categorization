the non wave streaming of the recess at the bottom is considered inpatient potential l the course of a layer of ideal inconspicuous fluid above the uneven bottom i have a form of 1 to the polygon n the depth of the unperturbed level of the free surface on the left on the back of the instance va the speed of the incurring stream 0 7 and 37 the angles of inclination of the left and right walls of the depression to the axis is compared to the axis g the acceleration of gravity which acts in the rule of the opposite direction of the axis of the os the order of the problem is used to compare bones the conformal display 06 j 1 of the course in the physical plane z on width strip 7 2 in the parameter of the plane t the function x t associated with the production dz dt formula is introduced dz 2 n d exp x t j t 7 regarding the analytical function x t the color task is formulated which is then reduced to the non linear integer of the ralyum equation l s 1 2 exp zs l s sin ts l s f s 1 7 r where l s fs re x s 7 l i 2 f s is the well known function of the argument s s and t known linear integers 11 fr vo gh frud number after discretion equation 1 is solved by the method new tone decisions for supercritical regimes on tackances that do not have in n down the stream are determined it was established that with a fairly large depth of the pit the solution becomes repeatedly fox and loses its physical meaning the work was supported by the rfff project 99 01 00169 the ant r d foundation and the universities of russia program 135
