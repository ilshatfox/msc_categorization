the use of the lattice cubic formula for calculating the integral in a particular area 1 e l bannikov institute of mathematics with the uc ras ufa it is required to calculate the integral in the eight dimensional region which is a direct work of two three dimensional balls of radii of 1 and two segments 0 1 x x r 3 x 6 1 2 0 1 2 we use lattice cubic formulas with a limited border layer ops formulas 1 the optimal properties of which are theoretically justified 2 the calculation algorithm for these formulas provides for the calculation of the integral as the sum of local integrals corresponding to the division of the unit in the area of integration which provides simpler forms of integration of the integration i f dxf x h 8 hkuss ckf hk kf hk kf f j j 0 j x 1 for x i f j j 0 j dx j x f x j supp j the work considers the first stage of solving the problem at this stage an integral is calculated with the function o for which supp 0 int that is the integral from the function of the function f x and the cutting function x cm 0 which ensures the circulation of the work f in the vicinity of the border it is theoretically substantiated that for this terms you can put ck h 1 without violating the optimal properties of the algorithm the 1 st work was carried out with the financial support of the rffif project no 06 0100597 and programs no 14 of the presidium of the russian academy of sciences high performance calculations and multiprocessor systems section 1 12 standard programs for parallel calculations of model tasks 91 application of the lattice cubatic formula k the integral from the work is approached by the following formula dx x f x h 8 hkgr korn 8 hk f hk the cutting function has the type x x 8 1 x 8 x 7 1 x 7 1 x 26 x 25 x 24 1 x 23 x 22 x 21 where t 2 t 1 t 0 t 0 t 0 0 t 0 d 1 m 1 0 d 1 m 0 t 1 1 t 1 m the smoothness of the function f x to calculate the integral 0 x f x dx the ma program in c is written using a library of parallel functions of mpi as parameters the submarine function f x were set by the parameters smooth parameter m thickness border layer the number of graternal points on the edge of a single cube to clarify the qualitative characteristics of the computing algorithm calculation accuracy computing work and counting time the program was tested on the mvs 15000 multiprocessor computer of the interdepartmental superception center of the russian academy of sciences the mvs 15000 has 922 simultaneously working processor with a distributed that is a memory separate for each two processor module we used 600 processors m 3 1 3 remained unchanged parameters the step of the lattice and the number of processors changed in table 1 shows the results of the calculation of the integral in a given area from the work of the cutting function to the function f x 1 92 e bannikova table 1 h 0 x f x dx the number of processor account time sec 1 7 2 990442 100 24 1 10 2 546245 600 63 1 12 2 546504 600 253 function f x 1 was chosen because this integral can be easily calculated manually and thereby check the accuracy of the result of the calculation of the program the exact result is 2 54695 o 10 5 and the table shows that an accuracy of 10 3 was achieved and with a decrease in the grate pitch the accuracy increases also an important characteristic of the program is the account time which should be minimal from the calculation data it is clear that with an increase in the amount of n points of the grill by 2 time the account increases by 4 times and the accuracy does not significantly change this is due to the fact that the area under consideration of a large dimension and a slight decrease in step h entails a significant increase in time so it is enough to limit ourselves n 10 in table 2 shows the results of testing the program on the functions f x x 1 x 2 2 x 3 x 4 2 x 5 x 6 2 x 7 x 8 2 1 here we can judge the accuracy of calculations by the stability of decimal signs after decimalum comparison h 1 10 and h 1 12 shows the accuracy o 10 3 table 2 h 0 x f x dx number of processor account time sec 1 7 3 420291227 100 29 1 10 2 907349766 600 73 1 12 2 909396611 600 296 in table 3 shows the results of the program for the function f x cos x 1 1 x 2 x 3 1 x 4 1 x 6 x 7 1 x 8 93
