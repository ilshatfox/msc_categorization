quasi alarmous approximation of the plates and shells based on the three dimensional cubic isopar of the ametric final element of the syarendipov family prokofiev e yu filimonova n yu the nizhny novgorod state university is currently the method of final elements mke is essentially a necessary component of the strength calculations when designing machines and structures at the same time despite the thunder number of studies on the basis of which entire families of final elements ke are building the problem of development on the de stroke and effective ke remains relevant it is most acute in the end element analysis of component thin walled structures a characteristic feature of which is the presence of a maxim of parameter the relative thickness of the supporting elements rods plates and shells the most accurate for plates and shells is a three dimensional mug and it is natural that a lot of attention is paid to the issues of its finite element approximation by immersing of the end element approximation of the sirens of the family the family movements of the pure and transverse beams of the beam strips by the researchers found that to eliminate the false deformations of the transverse shift leading to the locking of the element the degree of approximation of the polynoma of the movements should not be lower than the cubic to eliminate the effect of locking when using the final elements with approximating polynomas with a step 132
