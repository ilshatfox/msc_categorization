the tensor of parallelity is the multidimensional surface of the projective space is considered as a variety of tangent planes in vivid compositional surfacing of the surface a given fields of the planes map and normal of the 2 nd kind of norden expressions were found for external differentials of the covarian differes of the reenses of the equipping quasitenzor with the help of the obtained geometric objects a tensor of parallelism was built and according to the casano that this tensor turns into zero tor and only when parallel transfer of the equipment are absolute that is they are carried out when they are displaced along the entire surface m k potapov moscow theorem on the relationship of the generalized smoothness module and k functional petra say that the function is f e lp a 3 if for 1 p oo f measuring on 1 1 a 3 and p oo and for p oo f continuous on 1 1 and 2 o f 3 2 o and llfllp a 3 mak 1 w 1 lf x l x 0 1 x rzl via en j p a 3 denote the best approach of the function j with the help of algebraic polynomials pn 1 degree not higher than p 1 in metric f e 174
