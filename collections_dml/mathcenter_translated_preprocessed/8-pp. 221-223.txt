martsinkevich for the haara system let t eint gern m the trigonometric system the number 0 2 and the function f l 0 2 we put a a t f ger n mm cn f mm where cn cn f 1 2 2 0 f t e intd t in 1934 levy proved that if f a 1 t and the function f is analytical on f 0 2 then the function f f a 1 t in this regard levy raised the question of what functions f can be taken in this theorem in 1958 katsnelson established the opposite for the levy theorem and thereby only analytical functions f act from class a 1 t to class a 1 t in 1940 martsinkevich began to consider many functions f a t with 0 1 where transformations f type j 1 occurred let the continuity module and n the positive 221 sequence with n 0 1 2 we put f ger n least cn f n we do not know here the final results about the transformations of f even for the case n 1 here we will consider similar issues for the haara x m t ughter system where you can get enough general results we introduce the necessary definitions we will determine the positive sequence m through the functions t with t 1 they say that t almost grows up almost if there is c 1 0 that t 1 c 1 t 2 t 1 c 1 t 2 with t 2 t 1 1 the almost expanding almost reducing function t satisfies 2 condition if there is c 2 0 that 2 t c 2 t 2 t c 2 t for t 1 one of the main results is the theorem let the continuity module and t an almost expanding or almost absorbing function that satisfies 2 condition then the inequality of a f f c f a f 1 is made for all f l 0 1 and all f lipm 1 for some constant c f in the case when 1 n t t 2 nt 2 d t c 3 2 n with all 0 and n 1 2 where n 2 n 2 based in this theorem certain values of the function t we will receive conditions for the continuity module when inequality is fair 1 222 work was supported by the russian federation project 99 01 00062 and the program leading scientific schools project 00 15 96143 g m ustinov yekaterinburg about the quasichebyshev subspurities in c q x if z is a ban on the space l is the closed subspace in z x z l then plx y l x y y inf zlex x z let x reflexive strictly convex space let s say that x has a property if in x there is such a complete minimum system fk k 1 which for any n n many an x x onic fk nk nk 1 ices 1 onic x x is certainly note that the space is lp 1 p has a property theorem 1 let q counting compact x has a property then in c q x there are such subspace l e that 1 dim l codim l urb 2 e c q x 3 plg is a single point g e theorem 1 is of interest in connection with the following known task does any separatic space c q x chebyshevsky subspace l dim l codim l inous contains if l e is the subspace in c q x then d l e hausdorfova metric between single balls of spaces e l theorem 2 let q counting compact l c q x dim l codim l inous then 0 there are such subspace e c q x and the counting subset a c q x a c q x which 1 d l e 2 peg 6 if g a b n khabibullin ufa 223
