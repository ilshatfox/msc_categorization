the stability and admissibility of the pair c 0 c 0 for linear variable equations is considered a linear variable equation xn n k 0 ankxk fn n 0 1 where xn fn sequence of elements from cm ank m m matrixes with complex elements it is assumed that the matrices i ann are reversible at n 0 i a single matrix we introduce the operator which each sequence x puts in line the sequence n k 0 ankxk determination 1 equation 1 steady asymptotically stable if with any free member f such that sup n 0 fn cm 0 with n solution x equation 1 satisfies the condition of sup n mid xn cm xn 0 for n determination of 2 a pair of spaces x y is permissible regarding the equation 1 if with any f x the solution x y determination of 3 a pair of spaces x y is permissible relative to the operator if x y i e if x y for any sequence x x the following statement is true cf 1 theorem let the equation 1 steady and steam c 0 c 0 26
