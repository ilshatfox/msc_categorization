the properties of local single leafful functions represented by structural formulas following the idea of work 1 we introduce and take off the classes of pupilly conformal display generated by the functions of classes s or e and the functions of the class of karateodori c 209 1 the symbol s a 3 denote the class of display one round circle d the elements of which are represented in the form where r f e s a 3 numerical parameters it is assumed that under the sign of the integral there are appropriate unambiguous vetes of the degrees of functions p and f taking values of 1 at the beginning of the coordinates with real a and 3 theorems about the distortion are proven a generalized constant kebe k a 3 for class s a 3 that is the radius of the greatest open circle with the center at point f o which is entirely contained in any one man sized riman surface f d was found each function f e s a b 1 1 r l l in a 3 jo 1 r lol z v d r at 3 1 the value of this constant is 1 4 2 la with non negative a and 3 the variant of the theorems of the doctors was obtained and the assessments of the initial taylor coefficients in the class s a 3 were found 2 the relevant issues are considered for the class o z of the prototypes w p l 0 r p zd defined in the field of d e c 1 the functions of r p e i p in particular the design of generalized faber polynomas which are raised with local conformal display w e f a 8 is taken as generators work support of the rffif project 01 01 00112 literature 1 grigoryeva v v shertov v g method of structural form of mule for local conformal display application analysis in the theory of tver tver tver tver tver tver tver 2002 s 12 19 210
