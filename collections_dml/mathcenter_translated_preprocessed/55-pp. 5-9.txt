numerical modelling of finite deformations with contact interaction a i abdrakhmanova l u sultanov in the paper a method of numerical investigation of the stress strain state of elastic solids with contact interaction is presented to perform the contact conditions in finite element implementation the method of penalty is used under which additional conditions for contact conditions are imposed locally on the element which leads to the possibility of constructing the so called contact elements locally for normal contact without friction is formulated functionality based on functions of the penetration the contact functionality is add to the function of elastic potential for the two bodies to search the contact area we use the closest point projection algorithm this algorithm allows building the contact elements based on the approach called master slave the contact problem formulated in a variational form with the use of these approaches is nonlinear and to solve this problem we applynewton s iteration method the results were obtained under the state assignment of the russian ministry of education and science 9 9786 2017 8 9 keywords finite deformations contact interaction penalty method closest point projection algorithm contact element 6 519 67 1 1 avdeyev iv gmail com ox s u r i u i r u u 1 2 7 3 u j d d c d x c ha da j ox ca hk dk j ck r ed u ln ca h juu ck h juu 1 c 1 ox
