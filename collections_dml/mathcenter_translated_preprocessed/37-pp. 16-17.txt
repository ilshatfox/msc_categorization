functions of the type of sinus for subharmonic function the term sinus type functions first appeared in the work 1 which refers to the function of the sinus type for the support function h z max worn re zw of the convex polygon d 17 v 2 the concept of the function of the sinus type is generalized for the supporting functions of convex areas with smooth boundaries in our work functions of the sinus type are constructed for subharmonic functions of the species u rez where u is some function convex at the interval of an material axis the work was carried out with financial support of the academy of sciences of the republic of belarus state contract 13 3 fm for the performance of work on the gntp theme problems of completeness and uniqueness and theory of entire functions l and t r a t r a 1 levinb ya interphyment with whole functions of special classes and the expanses associated with it into the ranks izv ussr academy of sciences ser matte 1975 t 39 no 3 c 657702 2 lyubarsky i rights of the exhibitor in smirnov spaces and interpolation with whole functions of special classes izv ussr academy of sciences ser matte 1988 t 52 no 3 c 559 580 r a bashmakov a a rumyantseva bashkir state university bashmakov rustem mail ru allarum mail ru about the conditions of the existence of a function an orthogonal specified system exponents the conditions for the sequence of complex numbers k k 1 2 when performing which from the fact that 18
