the use of artificial neural networks to evaluate the level of cognitive impairment this work is devoted to the development of a neural networks of a plexus which allows to evaluate the level of cognitive impairment in elderly and senile patients they distinguish light moderate and severe cognitive disorders 1 that way the task of the neural network was the correct classification of patients according to the following groups 1 patient is healthy 2 the patient has light cognitive impairment 3 the patient has moderate cognitive disorders 4 the patient has severe cognitive disorders the initial sample consisting of 127 people was divided into teaching 70 people and the control 57 people group the parameters of the neural network were age to the face of full years the average time of the complex sensorimotor reaction of the choice to the visual stimulus ms the amount of errors when performing the test to a complex sensorimotor response of the choice peak latency of the p 300 of the occipital leads o 1 o 2 to build a diagnostic system a multi layer perseptron was selected 2 the input layer of the neural network was from 5 neurons which corresponded to the number of initial parameters the number of neurons of the hidden layer was selected experimentally and amounted to 53 neurons the output layer with 4 neurons stood as a function of activation m v studye 61 was used by the sigmoid function f x 1 1 e x the neural network is implemented in charp to teach the neural network an error algorithm was used this algorithm minimizes the midst of the neural network using the method of gradient descent in the space of thresholds and weight coefficients of fitsiments 3 during testing the neural network correctly symbolized patients in more than 86 of cases thus the use of artificial neural sets allows you to classify patients with high accuracy by the level of cognitive impairment which can be used to select the effective tactics of treating patients in addition the use of a developed neural network of a plex can significantly reduce the time aimed at assessing the level of cognitive impairment l and t r a t r a 1 zakharovv v yakhnon n cognitive disorders in old and senile age method a manual for a doctor moscow 2005 71 p 2 khaykin simon neuron networks full course 2 nd ed per from english m ed house williams 2006 1104 p 3 akhterova v kirilchenkoa a fundamentals of theoretical robotics artificial neural networks review moscow 2008 http www keldysh ru papers 2008 prep 02 prep 2008 02 html
