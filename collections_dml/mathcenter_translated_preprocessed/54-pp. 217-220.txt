maximal density of numbers sequence a f kuzhaev in this work we announce relations between different densites of a positive sequence and variables related to them namely given the formula for calculating themaximal density of the positive sequence keywords sequence of positive numbers maximal density upper density udc 517 98 c algebra generated by a display which induces the inverse half group a yu kuznetsova 1 1 alla kuznetsova gmail com kazan volga federal university in the article discusses c albras generated by special species display the display specified on the counting set induces the family of partial isometry operators which generates the studied algebra the work provides conditions under which this family multiplictively gives rise to an inverse half group and the corresponding algebras are studied keywords c algebra inverse half group invariant subspace general shift operator algebra greenhouse let ffic x x the display of the counting set x in itself satisfying the condition of the card pul 1 x mm for any x x the graph x gment with the vertices at the points of the set x and the ribs x onic x is associated with the pair x c algebra c x generated by the display is associated with this graph the structure c x was proposed in 1 we assume that the graph x gment is coherent in addition we believe that wor x x is not with any n n and x x 218 materials of the international school conference specified for x the reflection induces on it a partial order ffic and the ratio of ising elevalent let s say that x y if there is such n n that ther y x let s say that the elements x and y n elvivient x n y if wor x ware y and is elivalent x peace if they are n excessive for some n purpose the family of functions ex xuss where ex y x y x y is the symbol of the crownker faces a natural orthonomated basis in l 2 x relations of ising ising and equivalence can be extended to the basic vectors identifying the element of the base ex with the corresponding element x x display ffic is induced by the closed operator tular l 2 x l 2 x tther f f 8 with which the family of partial isometry operators is associated with u uk k organ taper u 1 p 2 u 2 p mum where the uk partial isometry with the initial space l 2 xk f l 2 x t f k f and the final l 2 k f l 2 x taper f k f f f under the algebra generated by the display gment the operator algebra c x generated by the specified family of partial isometries is understood families u and u multiplying generatively generate the invuloving half group mon x the elements of which are called monomas obviously the linear combinations of monomas are dense in c x in 2 the criterion of the ignorance c x is given theorem 1 the following conditions are equivalent 1 c x is irrelevant on l 2 x 2 from equality w ex ex w ey ey for anyw mon x ex ey this criterion allows you to introduce another equivalence on the basic vectors let s say that the basic vectors ex and ey are excessive ex y if for any w mon x is performed w ex ex w ey ey it is easy to check that is indeed the ratio of equivalence and breaks the set ex x x into non overeating classes let jx 0 ex ex x 0 the equivalence class of the basic vector ex 0 we are interested in when the half group mon x is inverse that is it consists only of partial isometries for details about the inverse half groups and the associated algebraic constructions see 3 4 theorem 2 the following conditions are equivalent 1 the half group mon x is inverse 2 from the condition ex pioneers ex yy follows the previous theorem can be formulated as follows a yu kuznetsova 219 so that the half group mon x is inverse it is necessary and enough to make it possible for any two ffic eject elements x and y the mutually unambiguous display x x such that pan and x y suppose that the set of u is manual that is together with u gives rise to an inverse half group we set on monks the following action of a single circle s 1 autc x z v z indv v v mon x and continue according to continuity we denote through c accord 0 the fixed subpulbire regarding the action of the circumference the investigation podalgebrac pul 0 switching ahead of the head whenu gives rise to the inverse half group note that c accord 0 is af albro if u is a manual set then c accord 0 is generated by the underground of the idempotents mon x the set x is called ising ising if the corresponding family of partial isometries u is manual let e x y x x y and e x y x x ip lling y offer let x brown set let there be at least one x x such that the many e x is final then e x is the final set for any x x and jx ey y e x if x is bar then you can completely describe
