the presentation of the algebra von neumann induced by a tightly defined operator m r timirshin kazan state university timirshinm yandex ru algebra von neumann in the hilbert space k is the involutionary subhalhgebra of the algebra of all limited linear operators in k closed in weak operator topology see for example 3 various representations of the algebr von 151 neumanans are one of the most important tools in the study of such algebra in this paper a representation is built related to a closed tightly given operator theorem let k l hilbert space m algebra von neumann acting in k t a closed tightly specified operator acting from k to l h l k then the display t m b h acting according to the rule t a t t t t a m where 1 2 t a 1 2 t t 1 t t 1 is carried out by an isomer physical algebra von neumann m and t m in particular when m b k then t is isomorphism algebr von neumann b k and p b t h p t where p t is an orthprojector to the operator s schedule t t definition in conditions of steam theorems t h it is called the representation of the algebra von neumanm m associated with the operator t the above theorem is a generalization of the design set forth in the sentence 16 of the work 1 it is also associated with the design of the algebra von neumann as evidenced by the next result the proposal let the algebra von neumann acting in the hilbert space k t a closed tightly set operator in k annexed to m h k k then the representations of the algebrus von neumann m t h and t h coincide where the display t m b h is determined by the formula t a p t a 0 0 a p t a m 152
