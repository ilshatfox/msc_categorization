materials of the youth school conference of udc 512 556 izomorphisms of the salgebrus of fully fully paul positive functions with the max examination of v v sidorov 1 1 sedoy vadim mail ru vyatka state university describes the isomorphisms of the gratername of the supplies of half floor of continuous positive functions keywords half a continuous functions grate of podalgebr isomorphism huguittic space this work is a natural continuation of the article 1 the introduction to 1 serves as an introduction to all work and contains the basic ideological prerequisites for the study recall several concepts and designations for the missing refers to 1 the half ring is called the algebraic system s 0 1 where s 0 is a community monoid with a neutral elemental of 0 s 1 monoid with a neutral element multiplication is distributed distributively regarding the addition of addition on both sides and 0 a a 0 0 for all a s the switching half ring different from the ring each non equal element of which is turned is called half floor with zero it is easy to show that if s is a half floor with zero then ab a b 0 for any a b s 0 therefore the many s 0 with the same operations of addition and multiplication forms an algebraic system that we will call half a floor let s this is the field r real numbers a half floor with zero r non negative valuable pacifier impose incompatible ones which are considered with interval topology we denote the many continuous s digit functions set on an arbitrary topological space x with the intended operations of addition and multiplication then c x c x r ko c x c x r semi ring iu x c x p halfupol the ring x is the algebra vodr podalgebra vc x will be any of its subset closed relative to the addition and multiplication of functions and withstanding the multiplication of constants from r by analogy we call the subset a c x s by the submarine if f g f g r f a for any f g a and r sher s thus we will use the term podalgebra in a broader sense than a ring that is simultaneously vector space we denote through a c x s the lattice of all the zamalgbr in c x s regarding the inclusion we will denote strict inclusion with symbol and through a 1 c x s the lattice of all the zavalgebr with 1 if a and b is the podalgebras in c x s then the exact lower line a b is a b and the exact upper line a b consists of the final sums of the functions of the type f 1 fn where f 1 fn a b n purpose if s r or s r then a b since 0 a b announcement if s p then possibly a b therefore we will consider an empty set element of the lattice a u x its zero v v sidorov 135 for any a b r put a b max a b and a b min a b if in p replace the usual addition to the max contribution we will get the p poop for the half floor u x c x p the concepts of zagalgebra and grates of the zagalgebr with a unit are determined in the same way as in the case of conventional addition podalgebra a call the b podalgebra if all functions from a are limited from above sp subdalgebra if any function f a is strictly positive i e inf f 0 and spb landscape if it is b and sp podalgebra at the same time minx podalgebra of functions that take at point x the lowest value the topological space x is called huguittov if it is a homo morpho closed to the subspace of a certain tikhon degree of r huguitt spaces for example compacts that is compact haussorf spaces recall that the central result of work 1 is the theorem 2 according to which the topology of any hughittic space x is determined by the lattice a 1 u x and as a result see the remark after theorem 2 the lattice a u u u u in other words for any hughitte spaces x and y the isomorphism of the reshetoka u x ia u y or their subrapishes 1 u x ia 1 u y entails the homeomorphism of spaces x and y the following natural issues arise question 1 how are the isomorphisms of the reshetoka u x ia u y and them under the lattice a 1 u x and a 1 u y question 2 how are the isomorphisms of semi field x iu y which give rise to the isomorphisms of their sstelets with a unit question 3 are the isomorphisms of the nasal hep with the unit of the floor of the fields x iu y which are not generated by the isomorphisms of the semi fields themselves the main goal of this work is to answer questions 1 3 let s make a number of preliminary comments 1 let isomorphism of the lattices a 1 u x and a 1 u y and x canonical isomorphism of the lattice a 1 spbu x and a 1 u x where x and y are huguittic spaces and x is the stone chekhov compacting of space x when proof 1 theorem 2 it was shown that the correspondence is ffic x y set by the rule onic x y minx miny x x y y is the homoomorphism of the spaces x and y moreover the restriction of ory x serves as the homeomorphism of the spaces x and y we identify the points of spaces x and y home
