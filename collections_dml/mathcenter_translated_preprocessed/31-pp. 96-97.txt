horizontal elevator of linear connectedness in the tangent of the second order of n i manin penza state pedagogical university let linearness of the mn is set on the basis of mn x y arbitrary vector fields on mn t 2 mn tangent to second order stratification over the data diversity this linear connectedness allows for each vector field x given on the basis of mn to build its horizontal sequels xh 0 xh 1 xh 2 in the stratification of t 2 mn and for each co chamber field respectively horizontal sequels h 0 h 1 h 2 these constructions are carried out local map u xi on the basis of mn generates a card 1 u xi 0 x i 1 x i 2 at stratification t 2 mn where is the canonical projection t 2 mn mn and xi 0 xi 1 xi 2 coordinate functions on 1 u t 2 mn i 1 n for each vector field x xi i the coadecetic field jdxj given on the basis the local representation of their horizontal sequels in t 2 mn have the form respectively xh 0 xm 0 m ijmxj 1 1 i ijmxj 2 2 i 12 iks sjm j ikm x j 1 x k 1 2 i xh 1 xi 1 i tmixm 1 2 t xh 2 xi 2 i h 0 idx i 0 h 1 k k ijx j 1 dx i 0 dx k 1 h 2 t 1 2 kpi t jk j t pi x j 1 x p 1 t jix j 2 dx i 0 t jix j 1 dx i 1 dx t 2 offer each linear connectedness given on the basis gives rise to the only linear connectivity h on t 2 mn which has the properties of hxh 0 y ha xy ha h xhb y ha 0 96 where a 0 1 2 b 1 2 linear connectivity h is called a horizontal lifting of connectedness from the base in tangent stratification the tensors of the twisting of th and curvature rh for the resulting connectedness were built l and t r a t r a 1 yano k ishihara s tangent and cotangent bundles diffe rential geometry new york 1973 analytical and numerical analysis of the irregular refraction of the shock wave a a matutin saratov state university www sgu ru solving the problems of the shock wave refraction uv on the surface separating the gas and gas liquid bubble environment when falling uv from the side of a denser environment with the formation of a vacuum wave refers to complex relevant little research tasks in practice there are often the tasks of interaction between low intensity in particular underwater and underground explosions the movement of bodies under water with supersonic velocities the movement of gas liquid mixtures along pipelines the peculiarity of such tasks is a complex picture of the current containing the areas of the decrease rarefaction and a sharp increase jump of pressure 1 2 in this work an analysis of various regimes of the uv refraction was carried out regular irregular and regular with the formation of ht closing the vacuum zone to describe the phenomenon an equilibrium model of a gas liquid environment is used 97
