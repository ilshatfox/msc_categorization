the theorems of the coating and distortion for algebraic polynomas methods of the geometric theory of the functions of the complex alternating are applied to inequalities for algebraic polynomas developing the ideas of work 1 we prove new inequalities including generally a free member senior coefficient and extreme values of either a module or a real part of a polynome on a circle or on a segment as an example we give the following result theorem let p z polin degree n with material coefficients normalized by conditions max p z z 1 1 min p z z 1 1 1 then for any 2 the inclusion p z z 1 z 1 tn z z 1 z 1 where is tn z 2 n 1 zn polina chebyshev as the consequences from here well known inequalities of chebyshev markov and bernstein stem from here the strengthening of some modern results for algebraic polynomas was also obtained 2 l and t r a t r a 1 dubinin v n distortion theorems for polynomas for surroundings matem sat 2000 t 191 no 12 s 51 60 2 borwein p erdly t polynomials and polimomial inequalites new york springer werlag 1995 480 p s i dudov saratov about the minimum ball layer containing the boundary of convex compact 1 let d a given convex bodily compact from rp 96
