dual regulator in the reverse task of final observation for the thermal conductivity equation f a kuterin nizhny novgorod state university xredor yandex ru the report is dedicated to discussing the dual regulatory algorithm namely regulatory of the unceasing data of the classical dual algorithm of udzava 1 for solving the reverse thermal conductive tasks the algorithm consists in the direct solution based on the gradient method of dual to the initial reverse task and is designed to restore the distributed right part 83 of the thermal conductivity equation iterative regulatory of the proposed algorithm is discussed the results of the computer program implementing the iterative regulatory algorithm are given this algorithm is designed to restore the right side of the equation let d u linger qt u x t u p c on qt u a closed convex set in rm qt a b 0 t the reverse task of the final observation is considered in the case of the first regional task for the thermal conductivity equation zt zxx u x t 0 z x 0 z 0 x x a b 1 z a z b 0 which consists in the approximate finding of a normal i e the minimum in the norm the coefficient distributed right side u d by the observation of q z the observation of the observation at the final moment of time t l 2 a b this task can be reformed in the form of an equivalent task of optimal management i 0 u inf i 1 u q u d q h l 2 pq where i 0 u u 22 qt i 1 z u t taking into account the approximate task of the initial data we have instead of the task pq the family depending on the error of their task of the tasks i 0 u inf i 1 u hafa q u d q h l 2 for this task it is possible to determine the functionality of the lagrange l q u i 0 u z u t haf q u d l 2 and dual the task v q sup l 2 v q min u 84 dual regulators consists in a direct solution on the basis of a gradient method of the indignant dual problem of r q v q 22 max l 2 regulating according to tikhonov it is important to note that for the classic algorithm of uzavava the existence of the saddle point of the lagrange functionality of the corresponding task of optimal control is necessary the proposed algorithm works both in the case of the saddle point and in the event of its absence in addition the dual algorithm unlike the classic algorithm is stable to the errors of the source data examples of solving a specific reverse problem with the described method are also considered for the solution a computer program written by the author was used the author expresses gratitude to the supervisor to professor m i sumin for setting the task and assistance in work the work was supported by the russian federation project 04 01 00460 l and t r a t r a 1 min m mathematical programming theory and algorithms m science 1990 2 vasiliev f p methods of optimization m factorial 2002 3 sumin m i regularized gradient dual method of solving the reverse problem of the final observation for the parabolic equation zhvm and matt 2004 t 44 no 11 s 2011 2019 search for the minimum path in a given class of relative homologies 85
