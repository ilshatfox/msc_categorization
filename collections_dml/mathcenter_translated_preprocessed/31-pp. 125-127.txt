degenerate resonance in systems with two degrees of freedom a v potapov nizhny novgorod state university named after n i lobachevsky will consider the system with two degrees of freedom f 0 x f x y g 0 y g x y 1 which after the transition to the variable action contribution write in the form f i j j r i j 2 i j k i j 1 125 where slow variables i and j change in a single single legged limited area r 2 mod 2 fast angular variables running two dimensional tor t 2 i j i j the function of slow variables i and j frequencies of unrelated oscillators functions f r k 2 periodic in the corners determination 1 we will say that in the system 2 there is a resonance p q if i j q p q we denote through ipq jpq resonant values i and j respectively determination 2 we will say that in the system 2 there is a degenerate resonance of order k if at the point ipq jpq all derivatives from the function by variables i j to order k inclusive 0 and at least one k 1 i derived is different from zero system behavior 2 near degenerated resonance i e the two dimensional torus of the unperturbed task determined by the values of i ipq j jpq significantly depends on the procedure for degeneration and the properties of the functions f r k characterizing indignation consider the case of degeneration of the 1 st order k 1 in 2 it was shown that in this case the system 2 is brought in the vicinity of the degenerate resonance 2 with the accuracy of the order of the order o to the species 2 3 f 2 3 g ffic 2 3 x 2 ay 2 3 where f gment g gment smooth 2 p periodic functions according to and parameter a is equal to one of the three values 1 0 with a 1 we have an elliptical case for a 1 a hyperbolic case for a 0 a parabolic case in the system 3 we can 126 but get rid of the multiplier 2 3 using the transition to slow time 2 3 t in the work 4 the example of the system 3 p 1 sin onic p 2 p 3 sinovern p 4 cos onic x 2 ay 2 p 5 x 4 where the parameter p 5 is associated with the introduction of the disorder a decisive deviation from degenerate resonance and p 2 with the non custody of indignation in the initial system in 4 the system 4 was investigated statements are given about the behavior of phase curves when changing parameters however the type of species 1 in which degenerate resonances would have existed until now in this paper this gap is replenished it is proved that in the system x x 2 x 3 y y 1 x 2 5 for 0 2 can exist degenerate resonances the work was supported by the rfff project 03 01 00478 the author expresses sincere gratitude to his supervisor a d morozov for his help l and t r a t r a 1 morozov a d global analysis in the theory of non linear vibrations nizhny novgorod publishing house of nsu 1995 2 karabanov a a morozov a d on averaging near you born resonance in a four dimensional two frequency problem tr sbmo 2004 t 6 no 1 p 292 357 3 karabanov a a resonances in four dementional quasi hamilton systems analysis and simulations regular and chaotic dynamics 2001 v 6 no 1 p 17 32 4 dragunov t n morozov a d potapov a v on the structure of degenerate resonant zones in quasigamilton si 127
