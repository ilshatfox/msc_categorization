complex structures for one indecent nilpotent group of lee in this work are considered almost complex structures j associated with levoinariat symptical structures determined in the non stitent six dimensional groups of lee such structures are interesting in that each of them can be associated pseudo rimanov metric g which allows the use of riman geometry methods to study them in 1 the classification of left indicative nilpotent groups of lee is given it contains 25 groups in 2 levoinariat integrated structures for indecent nilpotent groups of lee and their explicit species are calculated consider one of the groups of lee included in the intersection of lists from these works find associated complex structures and calculate the scalar curvature and the ricci tensor of associated metrics consider a group of lee 1 whether the algebra is in the basis e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 e 5 e 6 has structural constants c 512 1 c 6 13 1 c 6 24 1 c 5 34 1 note that this algebra lee has a two dimensional center z formed by e 5 e 6 vectors the general element of the x algebra can be represented by a matrix x of order 6 the first four lines of which have the form 0 x 3 0 x 6 0 x 5 0 0 0 x 1 x 5 x 6 0 0 0 x 2 0 x 6 90 0 0 0 0 x 2 x 4 and the last two are zero the general element of the corresponding group lee g 1 has the form g id x where id is a single matrix left means sympy structure is specified 1 2 form 1 6 2 3 4 5 where i is 1 form dual base ei the almost comprehensive structure of the type j lection is considered where i j 1 6 the condition of association with the sympy structure has the form jx jy x y from this condition we get j 11 12 24 54 ran 44 m 14 61 ran 31 31 51 m 41 m 11 the almost comprehensive structure is integrated complex if its tensor neyenheis n x y 2 jx jy x y j x jy j jx y converts to nyl equating the elements of the neienheis tensor to zero and checking the condition j 2 1 we get two different families of complex structures j 1 0 0 1 0 222 unk 23 1 2 22 22 22 22 22 mit 23 31 urb 231 2 22 0 0 31 1 222 23 m 22 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 51 0 oring 231 cil 2 54 0 1 54 1 22 ran 23 1 2 22 22 22 edge 31 cil 222 acy 31 urb 231 cil 2 22 51 1 0 91 j 2 0 0 1 0 31 urb 23 0 23 ran 31 urb 23 0 31 1 23 0 34 0 0 0 0 51 m 51 m 34 31 urb 23 54 0 1 answers 2 34 mal ma 31 n 34 m 23 n 51 1 0 the report will present associated metrics for j 1 and j 2 and their properties l and tr u r and 1 khakimdjanov y goze m medina a symplectic or contact structures on lie groups preprint http arxiv org abs math dg 0205290 2 magnin l complex structures on indecomposable 6 dimensional nilpotent real lie algebras preprint http www u bourgogne fr monge l magnin s a korolev nizhny novgorod state university named after n i lobachevsky korolev s a mail ru to study resonances in the system of two weakly tied pendulums consider the system with two degrees of freedom consisting of two weakly tied pendulum equations sin x a cos x sin y b cos y 1 92 where is a small positive parameter a b parameters this system is close to nonlinear integrated with 0 the system 1 breaks up into two independent equations the phase cylinder of each of the uninocated equations is divided into two areas oscillatory filled with closed phase curves that do not cover the cylinder and rotational in the oscillatory areas new variables of action are introduced angle i 1 i 2 1 2 varias of action i 1 i 2 determine the two dimensional invariant thor 1 2 angular coordinates on it the movement on the torah is conditionally periodic with frequencies 1 i 1 2 i 2 the following is the resonant case when the frequencies are commensurate that is the ratio of p 1 i 1 q 2 i 2 0 is performed where p q is natural numbers the condition of commensuration determines the resonant curve on the plane of variable action in the vicinity of the point of this curve a three dimensional average system is calculated the functions in the right parts of the equations of this system are obtained in the form of rapidly converging rows leaving the main members in the rows we get the system v w p 1 u 2 p 2 uw p 3 w 2 w p 4 p 5 p 6 cos pv p 7 p 8 p 9 cos pv u p 10 p 11 cos pv w u p 12 p 13 cos pv p 14 p 15 cos pv u p 16 cos pv w 2 where pi is the parameters and p 4 p 7 p 10 p 12 p 14 linearly depend on a and b for the system 2 a study was conducted with 93 standing equilibrium a numerical study of the system 2 was also carried out depending on the parameters the work was carried out with the support of the rffi project 06 0100270
