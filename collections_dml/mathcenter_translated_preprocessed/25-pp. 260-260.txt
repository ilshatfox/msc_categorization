the existence of solutions to the non linear problem of the equilibrium of the non existence of the shells in the movements of r scma rigs kra ev i am a task geometrically and physical theory of thin elastic anisotropic non nominal shells of non equal gaussian curvature with sha rnirically covered with my edges the aim of the work is to proof of the theorem of a generalized solution in the space of movements the central place in the proposed studies occupies the construction of the space of movements h p for this purpose the task of riemann hilbert for generalized an anus is used finding a generalized solution entered with the help of the variational principle of lagrange reduces the solution of the non linear operator equation of the type c g c o 1 where g cj is an non linear limited operator in h q the perceptibility of equation 1 is established by the variation method for this purpose the functionality j c of the complete energy of the system shell load is introduced into consideration showers are that with some restrictions on physico geometry characteristics of the shell functionality j w 1 is defined and differentiated at any point n p and grad j c 1 c g c 2 weakly half snow from below in n n 3 is increasing functionality in n p then on the basis of a generalized weerstrass theorem the functionality of j c on n p has an absolute minimum point which is the desired solution to the problem equal to weight 260
