university kazan this work is devoted to the study of the new variational reverse edge of the air hydrodynamics problem the tasks of maximizing the aerodynamic quality of the wing profile streamlined by the stream of inconsistent fluid taking into account the viscosity of the course in the approach of the border layer an accurate solution has been built the problem of non confusion of the decisions received in the permissible class of single leaf movements was discussed a procedure is proposed that allows you to find physically implemented profiles with a single leafy area of the current with the value of aerodynamic quality which is quite close to extreme the introduction of following 3 4 the term variation reverse marginal tasks is used to refer to this class of two dimensional flat regional tasks with unknown boundaries which are sophisticated both the solution of the differential equation in private derivatives and the field of its determination itself moreover the latter has a certain extreme property and at the border d one regional condition is set as in direct tasks the extreme property of the region d is expressed in the form of the requirement of maximizing minimizing the given functionality j usually with additional restrictions at the same time the border itself is also a desired element of the solution therefore such tasks are adjacent to a wide class of regional tasks with unknown boundaries from the described production it follows that variations of the okz include on the one hand to the tasks of optimal design see for example 14 16 on the other hand to the tasks of optimizing systems with distributed 1 work completed with financial support of the rffi projects no 05 0801153 no 06 01 81019 bel a an rt project 05 5 4 341 119 the task of maximizing aerodynamic quality parameters see 9 studies conducted in 4 5 showed that the use of methods of the theory of reverse edge tasks okz 1 allows you to reduce variations of the okz to the tasks of classical variational calculus in this case the presence or absence of additional restrictions can significantly change the picture of resolving tasks therefore the problem of choosing optimized functionals and additional restrictions is relevant it is difficult for general reasons to find a solution to this problem at the same time one of the natural sources of variation of the okz is classical aerohydnamics mathematical models of aerohydrodynamics allow you to write optimized functionality in explicitly and physical limitations of these models are restrictions in optimization as a result the production of variations of okz aerohydrodynamics is obtained in the case of simple mathematical models of currents an analytical function acts as a sophisticated as noted in 4 5 in the current time of variation of the okz for analytical functions the correctness of tasks can be examined if you set many desired areas in the form of many images of the canonical area in particular the appearance of a single circle e 1 for a special class of conformal or quasiconic display described by the control p by moving to the canonical area you can represent the functionality of the task in the form of j j p as well as write down on the language of control p all additional restrictions 1 physical model of the flow of wing profile let the wing profile i e the wing section a flat area limited by a closed contour is located in the plane z x iy fig 1 a and is stuck on the established stationary uniform fluid stream we denote through the gz a current area containing an infinitely trimmed point through the lz the contour of the profile and through the vrance the value of the flow rate at infinity without restriction of community we put vinger 1 we assume that the lz contour is hidden it has 120 a m elizarov a e ilyukhin a n ihsanova perimeter l 2 closed and smooth with the exception with exception be maybe the only point b which is called the back edge we believe that at this point an internal angle is set to the area equal to 1 2 with 1 we get a smooth outline everywhere let us choose the beginning of the cartesian coordinate system x y so that it begins with the point b z 0 and the abscissa axis was parallel to the vector of the speed of the incoming flow c fig 1 physical model of the flow of wing profile a wing profile in the physical plane b a typical type of speed distribution v s c the canonical region in the auxiliary plane as you know the profile chord is called a segment connecting the back edge b with the point c most remote from it for physically real chord profiles it is always determined unambiguously we denote the length of the chord through the b and through is the angle of attack the angle between the profile chord and the direction of the speed of the run up flow see fig 1 a 121 the task of maximizing aerodynamic quality
