the dynamic model of the geodetic tube in the metric of schwarzshilda l i rozakov tatar state humanitarian and pedagogical university gumlei rambler ru is one of the sections of riman geometry which can be considered in the theory of gravity as a dynamic theory of particle theory in gravitational fields determined by metric tenzor the four dimensional rimanov space with the lorentsev signature 1 1 1 1 at the same time the trajectories of massive trial particles correspond to the time like geodesic and the isotropic ones are of the blessed exploring the geometry of geodetic lines it is possible to restore local and even global geometry of space time the most complete study of the geometry of space time is achieved by a study of the geometry of the geodetic tube i e the conspiracy of close geodetic the aim of the work is to study the geometry of geodetic 133 tubes in the schwarzshild field and the construction of a dynamic model of this tube such a task is very difficult for analytical research since its solution is associated with the study of the system of non linear differential equations and finding a solution to this system however the package of symbolic mathematics maple allows you to conduct a complete study of this task as you know the relativistic equations of the movement of the massive particle in the gravitational field described by the gik metric in the four dimensional space time v 4 coincide with the equations of geodetic lines in this space d 2 xi ds 2 ijk dxj dxk ds 0 i k 1 k 1 k 1 k 1 4 where ijk are the symbols of christofeffle ii dui ds ui four dimensional particle speed vector s invariant part of the particle and there is a ratio of the standard gikuuuk 1 consider the metricushwartsshild this is the metric of the spherical gravitational field in the void ds 2 dr 2 1 2 m r r 2 d 2 sin 2 d 2 dt 2 1 2 m r where m is the gravitational radius of the central body the maple package has created the procedures of the numerical solution of the geodetic equation with a different value of the moment of the pulse l 134 60 40 20 0 20 40 60 60 40 20 20 40 60 fig 1 2 0 2 4 6 8 y 4 2 2 4 6 8 10 12 x fig 2 from fig 1 shows that when moving to the central body the geodetic tube is compressed and when it is removed from it it expands in this case a precession of the elliptical orbit of particles around the central body occurs 135
