it is quite a geodesical placement determined by the infinite zealousness of the tangent stratification of the generalized lagranzhev space o v sukhov penza state pedagogical university rimanova the structure of almost a work set by infinitezimal coherence on the stratification of the generalized lagranzhev space inviaritionale characteristics have been obtained in the case when the horizontal distribution determines a completely geodetic formation let m smooth n diversity tm tangent stratification n infinitezimal connectivity that determines the horizontal distribution z 7 hz and therefore the structure of almost the work on tm tz tm hz vz where vz is a vertical distribution let h and v design operators on h and v respectively h 2 h v 2 v hv vh 0 then p v h is the operator of the structure of almost the work p 2 id p hx hx p vx vx the rimanic metric of the structure is almost a work of the naz 148 metric g satisfying the condition x y hx hy vx vy for any vector fields x y from where it follows that px py x y let the basic diversity m is a generalized lagran space with a metric tensor g consider the metric on tm rimanov determined by the conditions g xh y h g xv y v g x y g xh y v g xv y h 0 where xh y h xv y v horizontal and vertical elevators of vector fields from the base to tangent stratification in connectedness n obviously so a certain metric g is a metric of the structure of almost a work in order for the horizontal distribution to determine a completely geodetic layer it is necessary and enough to make the condition hxp 0 to the arbitrary horizontal vector field hx see 1 where is the coherence of levy the chivites of the last analysis of the latter conditions in the structure adapted to the structure of almost work leads us to conclusion the proposal ininsimal connectivity sets a completely geodetic formation if only if the horizontal distribution of this connectedness is integrated and the basic diversity is rimanov note that if the basic variety m is rimanov infinite zero is generated by levy s coherence the chivitis of the metric g then the space m g is flat l and t e r a t r a 149
