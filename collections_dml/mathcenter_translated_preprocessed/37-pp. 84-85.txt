some of the upper assessments in the problem of hilbert mail in 1998 s smeyl see 5 proposed to consider the restriction of the second part of the 16 th hilbert problem on a special class of polynomial vector fields on the plane relations y f x x 1 are called the equations of lenar in 1999 yu s ilyashenko and a panov 2 found a clear upper assessment of the number of maximum cycles of lenar equations depending on the degree of odd unitary polynomial f and on the upper assessment of the modules of its coefficients the result of 2 is based on the theorem of ilyashenko yakovenko 3 which connects the number of zeros and the growth of the holomorphic function a few years later yu s ilyashenko suggested finding an analogue of the result from 2 for generalized lenar equations yh x xf x x 2 the main result of this message is a clear upper assessment for a special class of generalized lenar equations which we call odd there is a very simple geometric condition for highlighting odd equations they do not have limit cycles in some vicinity of infinity in other words all limit cycles 85 are contained in some vicinity of the beginning of the coordinates this criterion is a natural generalization of the difference between the conventional equations of lenar by the odd and even degrees see 4 2 and 1 the work was carried out with financial support from the rffif projects 07 01 00017 and 08 01 00342 programs of the president leading scientific schools of the russian federation project nsh 3038 2008 1 and the program universities of russia project rnp 2 1 5055 l and t r a ta 1 cauberghm dumortier f hilbert s 16 th problem for classical lienard equations of even degree in preparation 2 ilyashenkou panova some upper estimates of the number of limit cycels of planar vector fields with applications to lienard equations moscow math j 1999 v 1 no 4 p 583 599 3 ilyashenkoyu yakovenko s counting real zeros of analytic functions satiffying linear ordinary differential equations j differential equations 1996 v 126 no 1 p 87 105 4 lins netoa de melow pughc c on lienard equations proc symp geom and topol springer lectures notes in mathematics 1977 v 597 p 335 357 5 smale s mathematical problems for the next century math intelligence 1998 v 20 no 2 p 7 15 86
