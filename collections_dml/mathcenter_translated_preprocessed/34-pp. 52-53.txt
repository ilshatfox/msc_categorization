small abelian groups regarding various classes of the abel groups i v gerdt tomsk state university let k is a certain class of abele groups we will call abelev a small relatively k or k mala if for any family of groups bi i organ where bi k for any i i is performed by hom a i organ bi i i hom a bi if class k coincides with the class of all abele groups then the k small group a will be called small in 1 the properties of the k small groups were studied and a complete description of small and d small aboles groups was obtained where d is the class of all divided aboles groups theorem 1 the following conditions for the abel group a are equivalent 1 a d small group 2 a of course the generated group 3 a a small group let the class of all reduced abele groups the following result was obtained 54 theorem 2 for the abel group a the following conditions are equivalent 1 a ala group 2 if m is the epimorphic image of the group a and m the direct sum of the cyclic groups of the final order then m is the limited group 3 if m is the epimorphic image of the group a and m the period of the wild group then m is the straight amount of the divided and limited groups 4 for any groups bi i i are such that b 1 i 0 and any homomorphism ffic a i et bi there is a final beam j i such that wor a iorn bi for the case when the group of the group without torsion is a limited group such results were obtained about k small groups theorem 3 let k a certain class of abele groups without twisting let g a group without twisting and a a group of group g such that g a is a limited group then g is a k mala group and only when a is a k malaya group consequence each subgroup of the final index of the k mala group without twisting an endless rank is k mala l and t r a t r a 1 gerdt i v small ableva groups bulletin of the tomsk university 2006 no 290 c 14 17 55
