classical isperimetric inequalities and isperimetric monotony of functionals for the first time the hypothesis of the existence of isperimetric monotony of the functionals was expressed by j hersh 1 this approach allows introducing an additional parameter continuously tie various physical and geometric characteristics of the region such as the main frequency of oscillations worshiping area maximum conformal radius and other values as a special case the property of isperimetric monotony contains a number of classical inequalities therefore summarizes them for the first time this property was proven by m kekhler jobin 2 in particular the polya sega hypothesis was proved about isperimetric inequality between the main frequency of oscillation and the rigidity of the twisting and the well known inequality of the faber the crane was generalized in this work new geometric functionals of the region and classical physical functionality are considered in 101 the dependence on the parameter is expressed in an explicit form in a degree form for them the properties of isperimetric monotony in the parameter are established and new isperimetric inequalities are proved including two parameters the work was supported by the rfff project no 02 01 00168 and the program universities of russia listed 1 hersch j isoperimetric monotonicity some properties and conjecturs connection between isoperimetric inequalitis sim rev 1998 v 30 no 4 p 551 577 2 kohler jobin m th une propri t de monotonie isop rim trique qui content plusieurs th or mes classiques c r acad sci paris ser a 1977 v 284 no 3 p 917 920 r b salimov p l shabalin kazan shabalin ksaba ru the display of the polygons was obtained different from 1 by setting and the method of solving the schwarz cristopheles formula in case of displaying the upper half plane on the polygon with a counting number of vertices exactly even if dz is a single link area the border of which consists of two broken l 1 z and l 2 z with a common point a 0 0 0 composed of an infinitely number of rectilinear links we denote through a 1 a 2 verses lz numbered sequentially when moving in a positive direction along l 1 z from point a 0 a 1 a 2 vertices l 2 z when moving along l 1 z starting from point a 0 the dz area remains on the left and when moving along l 2 z from point a 0 on the right the angles 10 2 0 0 10 2 20 10 2 formed with a real axis with the beginning at point a 0 l 1 z l 2 z respectively k 0 k 1 1 kk 1 respectively are considered known k 1 k 2 internal angles in relation to the area at the vertices ak a k k 1 urb it is required to determine the conformal display z of the upper half plane in the plane of the complex alternating ctor i to the dz region so that the contour l 1 z corresponds to the actual semi shaft 0 102 passes to point a 0
