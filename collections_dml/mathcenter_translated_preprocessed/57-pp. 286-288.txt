materials of the multiple interporation for the privalov spaces in a disk e g rodikova v a bednazh the problem of interporation on the set of multiple nodes for the privalov classes of analytic functions in the unit disk solved keywords interpolation multiple nodes the privalov spaces analytic functions udc 512 643 integer measurement matrices with small elements of k s ryutin 1 1 kriutin yahoo com moscow state university named after m v lomonosov in the work discusses the possibility of constructing integer measurements with small elements and the speed of operation of recovery algorithms is evaluated key words restoration of vectors integer measurement matrices the task of restoring the integrated rarefied vector according to a small number of linear measurements closely related to the theory of compressed measurements see for example 1 is considered the problems of the restoration of vectors on linear dimensions set by integer matrices were probably the first to consider l fukshansky d nidell and b sudakov in 2 we fix the designations and give some definitions the equation y ax is considered where a is the integer m d matrix we will call it a measurement matrix under a it is understood to be the maximum of the modules of the elements of the matrix a ai j the vector x is supposed to be s fissored that is its carrier has a power s and m max x j the main issues are when can you build an integer m d matrix a such that any s detailed vector x zd can be unambiguously restored according to the ax vector such a matrix will be called good or s good how small can the elements of such a matrix be made present the recovery algorithm and evaluate its complexity we describe the known results in 2 it is shown that for the matrix of a zm d which a k and all m m submits have a full rank in a necessary condition d o k 2 m similar matrices provide the uniqueness of the restoration of vectors at s m 2 the existence of such matrices by the authors 2 is proved by d p km these results were significantly improved in the work 3 5 more precisely in 5 it is proved that with large k for the existence of the above matrix it is necessary that d 100 k logkm at m logk and d 400 km m 1 m 3 2 at 2 m logk of the known hypotheses regarding the properties of random matrices it follows that with m logk this rating is close to optimal in addition in the work of s v konyagina and b sudakova 5 proposed a very natural design of the matrix a c a k in which everything m m submissions have a full rank in the assumptions m d max k 1 km m 1 2 the question of effective k s ryutin 287 actually recovery algorithm it was not considered let m p a matrix of elements i j z where i j k j i 1 mod p 1 j p 1 i m p is a simple number and m p k j fixed integers of 1 k j p thereby a certain representative of the deduction class for each element of the matrix was recorded it was this design that was considered in 5 while the elements were selected so that i j p 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 m we want to restore the vector x zp with non equal coordinates s m 2 according to this vector y y 0 ym 1 x zm we do not know the value of s and evaluation we carry out the complexity of the algorithm in terms m p m max x j it is known that for o t operations in the final field f you can solve the given t t system of linear heterogeneous equations where the best known 2 4 b 4 proved theorem there are determiners an algorithm that allows you to find according to the vector y vector x zao m logp m m 2 o 1 p 1 2 o 1 of arithmetic operations in the fp and zao m 2 logp m operations in the ring calculations are made with numbers not large in module than max m p max j y j mp 1 1 m there is a natural desire to build good measurements matrices with as lower elements as possible prepint is devoted to this issue 6 for example the boolery matrices it turns out that there is a simple design that according to the set m d integral matrix a and the number z n 2 z a builds mr d matrix with z where r logz a 1 at the same time it is true see 6 sentence 1 let the integerm d matrix a and algorithmic composition is given which finds any integer vector x zd with the size of the size of no more than the well known ax then there is an algorithm that allows you to restore the vector x by and at the same time the complexity of the mr arithmetic operations in z with numbers that do not exceed a the investigation when large and any s c 1 n log n the matrix n matrix with unambiguous restoration of any vectors from the carrier of power is no more than s in addition using the generalization of the design of the matrix the case of the fpr field was shown that it was completed see 6 drying 2 for any simple number p and numbers r s n s pr 2 there is an integer matrix size r 2 s 1 1 p
