topologically zn graded semigroup c algebras s a grigoryan r n gumerov e v lipacheva the report deals with the reduced semigroup c algebras for the normal extensions of cancellative commutative semigroups by the additive group zn of integers modulo n we present a general method for constructing the extensions generated by one element and give examples of such extensions for the additive semigroup of non negative integers themain result discussed here is the following statement the reduced semigroup c algebra for the above mentioned extension is a topologically zn graded c algebra keywords cancellative semigroup extension of semigroup group of integers modulo n exact sequence fell bundle normal extension generated by one element graded c algebra reduced semigroup c algebra semigroup of non negative integers topologically graded c algebra 517 53 1 1 cmex 1990 goose yandex ru 1 e 1 1 c z z 0 1 c 0 2 1 a an n 1 c an 1 a 1 a bn n 1 sup n n ln ln bn ln an 2 limsup an ln ln bn ln an 1 f f an bn n 1 2 2 128 ln b 0 b 0 lnb b 0 1948 3 1 bq u v bq u v v u v v u v q 0 b 0 u v exp q i 1 ui i 1 v i 1 v i q n a an rnei n n 1 c rn 0 0 a 0 n 1 sin n r n 1 3 e z e a z an 1 z an z a n an 1 bq z an q a a e z a 4 2 1 c bn 1 1 2 0 3 limsup n 1 ln an ln ln 1 an e an 3 limsup n 1 ln an ln ln 1 2 an e an 4 an 1 4 4 an 0 an exp an an r 129 2 5 6 1 1 1 a 2 1 e z a
