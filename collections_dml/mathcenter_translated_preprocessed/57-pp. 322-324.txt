materials of the about the explicit form of hermite pad e polynomials a p starovoitov n v ryabchenko in this article new concepts are introdued quite normal index and quite perfect system of functions using these concepts for an arbitrary system of power series a criterion for the uniqueness of the solution of the two hermite pad e problems is formulated and proved explicit determinant presentations for type i and type ii hermite pad e polynomials are obtained the proven assertions complement the well known results of theory of hermite pad e approximations keywords hermite pad e polynomials normal index perfect system hankel determinant udc 517 54 the final fox of analytical functions l a suan 1 1 laxuan ctuet edu vn kazan volga federal university institute of mathematics and mechanics n i lobachevsky investigated the harmonic displays of the circle in the areas that can be cut into the final number of convex hodo assessment of the foxes of the holomorphic display of the circle made up of the analytical component of the harmonic reflection was obtained keywords harmonic single leaf n linding convex functions shear design let d z z 1 a single circle on the complex plane c a is the linear space of the analytical functions determined in d endowed with the topology of a locality with a locality through b we denote the class of functions a such that z 1 with z d consider the linear space of complex digit harmonic functions f h g where h g a and g 0 0 endowed with the same topology note that the representation f h g is the only one and is called the canonical representation of the harmonic function f function h is called the analytical part f g is called the co analytical part f we will say that f retains orientation if jacobian j f z fz z 2 fz z 2 0 in d since fz z h z and fz z g z the condition j f z 0 is equivalent to inequality g z h z which means h z 0 and thus you can determine the function b which is called dilatation f according to the formula z g z h z where h z 0 in d let s the class of functions f z z a 2 z 2 analytical and single leafy in d clooney and shele small proposed the method of design shift to obtain a harmonic display with a given dilatation on the region convex in one direction consisting in the shift of a given conformal display along the parallel lines the design of the shift is justified by the following theorem theorem a 1 the harmonic function of f h g in d is a single leaf display of the circle d convex in the direction is material l a suen 323 respectively imaginary axis and only when h g respectively h g is a conformal display of the circle d convex in the direction of the material respectively imaginary axis this theorem can be reformulated as follows of the theorem b 2 let the function f h g are harmonious and local one leafing in d 0 2 let the function f h g are harmonious and convex in the circle d in article 5 the hypothesis about the existence of r was put forward such that the analytical function h ei g is convex however in our work 4 we showed that this hypothesis is incorrect in this work we study the question of the maximum foxness of the h ei g function where h g respectively are the analytical and co analytical parts of f for the region which can be cut into n convex hodo to do this we need the definition of 1 3 the function f z icle 1 an zn is called p list in the area d if it does not take values more than p times in d and there is some w 0 such that f z w 0 has a rolity p solutions in d when the roots are calculated in accordance with their multiples determination 2 the area is called a n conjudge area if it can be cut into n convexicated huddings let is a n groove area which is cut into n convex gangs k k 1 n let f h g a harmonic and local single leaf display of the circle d to the n conap region and dk f 1 k d we have proved theorem let f h g a harmonious and local single leaf display of the circle d to the area if the pi is a n condensed region then the function management function h z ei g z is nothing more than n lister in the circle d literature 1 clunie j g sheil small t harmonic university ann acad sci fenn ser a i 1984 vol 9 p 3 25 2 duren p harmonic mappings in the plane cambridge cambridge univ press 2004 226 p 3 goodman a w an invitation to the study of university andmultivalent functions internat j math math sci 1979 vol 2 no 2 p 163 186 4 kayumov i r ponnusamy s xuan l a rotations of convex harmonic univalent mappings bulleti
