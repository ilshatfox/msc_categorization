the weak sequenced completeness of one factor spaces in the space of integrated operators let the accurate normal semi endless trace of m and n its gaggogra of the neumann are highlighted on the algebra of the neuman suppose that the trace n is the restriction of m on n is also semi confusing we denote through l 1 m and l 1 n the space of operators integrated relative to m and n respectively and through k m and k n the corresponding spaces of completely measurable operators the set of sets k p x k m q mpr q p qxq p q where 0 p mpr p forms the basis of zero surrendering to separate the topology in k m consistent with the linear structure we will call this topology a local convergence topology as they theorem 1 3 let x such a subspace l 1 m that a single ball x is closed in the topology of local convergence as they then the factor space l 1 m x is poorly sequenced the proof of this theorem in the main features is transferred from the work of godfrois 1 which discusses the switching l 1 spaces only instead of the theorems of bukhukhovalov lozanovsky used there its inconsistent version of 2 is used theorem 2 factor space l 1 m l 1 n is poorly sequenced theorem 2 immediately follows from theorem 1 if you notice that a single ball of space l 1 n is closed to k m in the topology of local convergence as they for the case of the final trace this fact follows from the fullness of the space k n in the topology of convergence as they in general the proof of opi is 206 on the version of the fatu theorem from 2 the previous case and the continuity of conditional expectation as a display from l 1 m with l 1 m m topology in l 1 n with l 1 n n topology the work was supported by the russian federation project 01 01 00129 l and t r a t r a 1 godefry g sos eespaces bien disposes de l 1 applications trans amer math soc 1984 v 286 no 1 p 227 249 2 skvortsova g sh a non communist analogue of the below lozanovsky theorem about the convex subsets l 1 kazan un t 2000 12 p dep in viniti 05 24 00 no 1489 b 00 3 skvortsova g sh tikhonov o e the weak sequenced fullness of the factor spaces of non commutative l 1 spaces theory of function its adj and adjacent vopr mater shk conf might 130 th anniversary of the birth d f egorova kazan publishing house kazan matte sto va 1999 s 203 204 v a skvortsov moscow on variation measures in the theory of integral henstoka method in the theory of integral allows you to describe a wide class of generalized integrals in terms of variation regarding this differential basis generated by the function of the interval in henstok theory the differential basis b is defined as a family filtering to include of the subset of the descartes work j rn where j is a lot of intervals in rn for the function of the interval wor for each element basis b and for the set e rn the version of the function wor on e var onic e sup onic i where the amount is distributed to the set of non disclosure is determined intervals i for which i x and x e and sup is taken in all 207
