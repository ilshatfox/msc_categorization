materials of the international school conference udc 517 52 on the maximum density of the sequence of numbers a f kuzhaev 1 1 arsenkuzh outlook com the bashkir state university in the work announces the relationship between different densities of a positive sequence and the values associated with them namely a formula for calculating the maximum density of a positive sequence is given key words sequence of positive numbers maximum density upper density through n mn 1 we will denote a multiple sequence of positive numbers more precisely n mmn 1 unlimited strictly increasing positive sequence and mn a natural number called the multiplicity of the element n n 1 recall that the upper density of the sequence of the eleals is called n lim t urb n n n n t t n t n t mn in addition we will need a characteristic introduced by j polya see 1 the maximum density of the sequence n 0 lim 0 lim t t n t t t t 1 p t 0 1 according to the lem of the paragraph e 3 of chapter iv of the book 2 the limit of the according to 0 always exists so the maximum density is determined correctly in addition we will also need the following values l lim t t t 1 ln 1 af t n t mn n 0 1 the value of l was first introduced apparently l a rubele in 3 and is closely connected with the logarithmic block of positive sequence by definition this is l inf ed 0 1 l subsequently the ruble and p malliaven in their joint work 4 showed that in the case of the final upper density the logarithmic block dexterity can be determined as follows l lim 1 l that is this limit always exists the logarithmic blockness turned out to be the most important characteristic of a positive sequence in resolving the issue of the completeness of the system of the exhibits in the horizon strip see 3 using these designations the following is formulated by a yu kuznetsova 217 theorem employment ofevermoetrieth upper distribution then the righteous equality of n 0 lim 0 l sup ed 0 1 l literature 1 polya g untersuchungen ber l cken und singularit ten von potenzreihen math zeitschr 1929 v 29 p 549 640 2 koossis p the logarithmic integral i cambridge university press 1997 p 625 3 rubel l a necessary and sufficient conditions for carlson s on entire function amer math soc 1956 t 83 p 47 429 4 malliaven p rubel l a small entire functions of exponential type with given zeros bull soc math france 1961 t 89 p 175 201 on maximal density of numbers sequence a f kuzhaev in this work we announce relations between different densites of a positive sequence and variables related to them namely given the formula for calculating themaximal density of the positive sequence keywords sequence of positive numbers maximal density upper density udc 517 98 c algebra generated by a display which induces the inverse half group a yu kuznetsova 1 1 alla kuznetsova gmail com kazan volga federal university in the article discusses c albras generated by special species display the display specified on the counting set induces the family of partial isometry operators which generates the studied algebra the work provides conditions under which this family multiplictively gives rise to an inverse half group and the corresponding algebras are studied keywords c algebra inverse half group invariant subspace general shift operator algebra greenhouse let ffic x x the display of the counting set x in itself satisfying the condition of the card pul 1 x mm for any x x the graph x gment with the vertices at the points of the set x and the ribs x onic x is associated with the pair x c algebra c x generated by the display is associated with this graph the structure c x was proposed in 1 we assume that the graph x gment is coherent in addition we believe that wor x x is not with any n n and x x
