operators of a weak type and independent functions let t x l 0 1 a positively homogeneous operator that is limited from the quasibanach space x into the space of measurable almost every final functions determined on the segment 0 1 with the measure of lebugam along with the operator t we consider the operator t xn l n determined as follows t xi 1 t xi ger i 1 theorem let 0 p inous the following statements are equivalent 173 1 the operator t is limited from the space x to the space lp 2 there is q 0 p that the operator t acts from the space lp q x to the space l i linger 3 the operator t acts from the space lp x to the space l f linger if the operator t is invariant relative to the shift then each of the conditions 1 3 is equivalent to the condition 4 there is q 0 p that the operator t acts from the space lp q x to the space l linger xi lq n sup i xi aged almost everywhere let us explain the designations used in the formulation of the theorem lp x l odd c 0 m t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t x t c p 0 lp q x xi xn xi lp q l i lip respectively l f lday consists of all followers xi l n those that if with each i n function xi and xi are equal to the equally proper probative sense of the function respectively the functions of the xi and xi are equally proper then sup i xi aged almost everywhere the xi functions are determined generally speaking in another probabilistic space operators limited from lp to lp ux are called low type operators p thus the theorem gives in particular the probabilistic characterization of such operators close to 3 the condition was used by e m nikishin 1 to describe operators who allow factorization through the space of lp urb l and t r a t r a 1 nikishin e m resonance theorems and supra linear operators success of mat sciences 1970 t 25 no 6 c 129 191 174
