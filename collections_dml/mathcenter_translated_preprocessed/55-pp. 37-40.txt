mathematics named by the name of german mathematician lotar collatus who formulated this task on july 1 1932 38 materials of the youth school conference this is information from wikipedia https ru

enthusiasts mainly programmers see http boinc thesonntags com collatz the purpose of our study is simple and naive to analyze the very mu and not decades of its discussion determination 1 the monument of odd numbers denot 1 and many odd numbers not multiple of 3 are denoted as n 3 determination 2 function of the collateral k an odd number n is made in accordance with the correspondence number m which is obtained from the number of 3 n 1 by dividing into the maximum possible degree of number 2 thus k n 1 n 1 the collateral hypothesis of any odd number is found in a natural n that k n m 1 lemma 1 k n 1 n 3 obviously because the first transformation is n 3 n 1 and therefore there can not be multiple 3 in the image lemma 2 k n 3 n 3 moreover each image m n 3 has an infinitely many prototypes in n 3 lemma 3 there are arbitrarily long chains confirming the hypothesis of the collateral example for any natural n it has an equality 2 n 1 3 2 n 1 1 therefore the length of the chain is up to 1 not less than n lemma 4 the prototype k 1 1 is infinite and consists of numbers 4 n 1 3 n n or in the court of information 1 101 10101 1010101 formally calculations the transformation of the collateral multiplies the initial the number is 3 and the division is guaranteed only by 2 therefore there is a false feeling that the images of the converting of the collatele can grow to infinity lemma 5 the even number is divided on average by 4 in fact we calculate the average even number to what degree is divided each one is divided into 2 i e degree 1 each second is still in addition to 2 i e 1 2 every fourth is still in addition to 2 this is 1 4 etc as a result we get the amount of 1 1 2 1 4 2 therefore on average after converting the collateral the original number m is multiplied by 3 and is divided by 4 which means it will be equal to 1 approximately through log 4 3 n steps however in the process of performing the collateral transformations not all even numbers may occur lemma 6 consider the transformation of the collateral as a display k n 3 n 3 then only 29 even numbers can appear in the collateral chains in fact these are only the numbers of the type 3 6 k 1 1 2 9 k 2 and 3 6 k 5 1 2 9 k 8 k n a bolshakova d stepanyan a v rozhkov 39 however even even numbers of this species are also divided by 4 and therefore our assessment of the length of the chain as approximately equal to log 4 3 n does not change the transformation of the collateral is a typical tsipomarkov when the next shawl depends only on the previous one consider two simplest cases the first case since the first iteration of the collateral transformation sends us inside the set n 3 we have only two types of odd numbers with which we need to work this is 6 k 1 and 6 k 5 k n lemma 7 let us have two states of the system this is the number of the type 6 k 1 and 6 k 5 k n then the matrix of the transitions of the markov process has a form of 1 3 1 2 1 2 this is already a matrix of the limiting transitions at the same time as follows from lemma 7 in chains of transitions of the collateral of the number 6 k 5 k purpose are twice as often as the number of the type 6 k 1 k n now we consider the numbers that are the odd numbers according to the module 18 in this case the set of n 3 will be divided into 6 subsets 18 k 1 18 k 5 18 k 7 18 k 11 18 k 13 18 k 17 k n 1 lemma 8 let us have 6 states of the system this is the number of species 1 the then the markov process transitions then have the form of 1 63 16 8 4 32 1 2 4 2 1 8 16 32 16 8 4 32 1 2 4 2 1 8 16 32 16 8 4 32 1 2 4 2 4 2 1 8 16 32 this matrix has a characteristic polynomial x 6 x 5 and zhordanov s shape of 5 gordan cells 3 cells with 0 one with 1 and one size 2 2 with its own value 0 the second iteration that is as erected in a square the floor matrix becomes a matrix of maximum probabilities
