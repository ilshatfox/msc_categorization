vector measure on j projections let 1 i hilbert space with an inner product in 1 it was studied 1 l measure on the logic bpr 1 i of all orthogonal projections on 1 i we consider 1 l measure on the j projections of j space the real case see in 2 let hilbert space dim 2 fix selfadjoint symmetry j j 1 the form jx is said to indefinite metric on let the set of all bounded j projections i e px vx on and let pl the set of all one dimensional positive negative projection fro function 1 i is said to 1 i measure if l pi for any representation l pi the series being strongly convergent and sup p l llpll the 1 i measure is said to semitrace if there exist h h 1 i such that pi h and 1 h regular measure if vh 1 i there is trace class operator mh such that h tr pmh vp theorem 1 any 1 i measure on is the sum of regular measure and semitrace theorem 2 every 1 i measure on is regular if and only if di j i h dim j i h proposition 3 let dim and let 1 i regular 1 i measure then the function h mn is antilinear and continuous at the strong topology 1 l and the norm topology on proposition 4 let 1 l d complex hilbrt spaces and let 1 l regular 1 l measure then there are continuous at the norm topology d the strong topology 1 i 1 i valued integrals ji and v such that and v pj vpep references 1 jajte r pa 3 zkiewicz vector measure on the closed subspa ces of hilbert space studia mathem 1978 v lxiii 229251 301
