the method of the epipler of the construction of the veneer profiles lazarev d f research institute of mathematics and mechanics n chebotareva of kazan state university in the work analyzed the eppler s method 1 solving the reverse regional problems of aerohydrodynamics compiled a corresponding gram of construction of wing profiles a series of numerical calculations was made and results were compared with accurate analytical solutions z fig 1 fig 2 the difference between the eppler method and a number of others see for example 2 is that the desired contour of the profile is divided into n parts see fig 1 2 for each section except for the first and last that is selected that which angle of attack in which the speed can be considered constant i e in fact the distribution of speeds is set as shelf on the first 242
