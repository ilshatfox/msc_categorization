reviewed cosmological solutions for fermi systems with scalar interaction of particles in 1 2 shows that the correct introduction of scalar interaction of particles into a kinetic theory leads to a change in the effective masses of particles m m q where q is the scaly particle charge is the potential of the scalar field in this work we study a special case of cosmological solutions when the tensor of energy pulse is determined by the statistical system of fully degenerated enzymes with a scalar charge q in 3 it was shown that in this case the energy density and pressure are represented in elementary functions ef m 4 8 2 1 2 1 2 2 ln 1 2 123 pf m 4 24 2 1 2 2 2 3 3 ln 1 2 t ef 3 pf m 4 2 2 1 2 ln 1 1 1 2 q m 3 2 2 1 2 ln 1 2 where pf m the attitude of the fermi impulse to the effective mass is the scalar density of charges see 3 consider the obtained system in the flat model of friedman with a metric ds 2 dt 2 a 2 t dx 2 dy 2 dz 2 the tensor of the energy pulse of the scalar field has the form of an energy immoral energy tensor of ideal fluid es 1 8 2 2 s 2 ps 1 8 1 3 2 2 s 2 einstein equations with a scalar source 3 2 a 2 8 3 a p consider the maximum ratios for the macroscopic values of the density of energy and pressure in the case of ef 1 4 m 4 4 a 4 2 pf 1 12 m 4 4 a 4 2 es ps 2 s 8 2 in this case the second of einstein s equations turns to identity as a result the cosmological situation is described by two equations relative to the functions t a t namely the equation of the scalar field and the einstein equation d dt a 2 dart dt 2 sa 4 4 124 3 a 8 8 8 8 m 4 4 4 2 a 4 2 2 8 the work provides a study of the resulting system l and t r a t r a 1 ignatiev g izv universities physics 1983 t 24 no 8 c 15 2 ignatiev g izv universities physics 1983 t 24 no 8 c 19 3 ignat ev y g miftakhov r f statistical systems of particles with scalar intection in cosmology gravitation cosmology 2006 v 12 no 4 p 179 185 o v michsova nizhny novgorod state university named after n i lobachevsky miov 6 yandex ru about one model of economic development taking into account the external effect of human capital the generalized model of the lukas r 1 economic development of the two section economic system is studied which includes the production sector and the sector that forms human capital the concept of human capital can be interpreted as a set of knowledge skills and other qualities of an employee that increase the effectiveness of his contribution to the production process 2 the level of human capital of a representative economic agent is denoted by h t and a share of its active time 125
