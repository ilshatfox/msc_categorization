the task of riemann on the endless surface let rimanov be the surface of the genus infinity on which there is a holomorphic function z taking each value in a complex plane from p once i a bikchataev 45 taking into account the multiplicity then the display z r c determines the permanent unlimited covering r z plane c with an infinite number of branches of branching the projection of which do not have in maximum points consider the regional task of riemann in the next post ke find a piece matororphic function f on r with a line of jumps of g a multiple of the 1 d divisor and limited in the surrendously style of the ideal boundary of the surface r the limit values of which on g belong to the class n l g t about 1 1 l o and satisfy the ratio p t g t f t g t t er 1 proved theorem empty d about 11 ast on r with compactm until they are fulfilled then d iets i tilts the day some of the top of the 10 th which is horsefly and lyuba d prov imaging i am in the od luu tu to ch superu d using this theorem the regional task of riemann 1 on the open surface r is reduced to the task of the riemann on whom the packet riman surface thanks to this the conditions for resolving were obtained and a clear solution to this problem has been given
