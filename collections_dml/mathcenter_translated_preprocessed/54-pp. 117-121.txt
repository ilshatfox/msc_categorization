technical institute state university studies a half group of the holomorphic displays of the strip and an isomorphic half group of the holomorphic display of right half plate in itself for the holomorphic display of the strip the fulfillment of the condition is required which is an analogue of hydrodynamic normalization distortion theorems for these display were obtained and the conditions under which the areas of one legged exist a description of the class of display which allow investing in single parametric half groups an analogue of the levner kufarev equation for the studied half group of display was obtained and the theorem of the existence and uniqueness of the solutions for this equation was established keywords holomorphic display distortion theorems monolithic areas a single parametric half group evolutionary family evolutionary equation let f the holomorphic display of the strip s z c 2 2 118 materials of the international school conference in itself and re f x urb with x urb the invariant form of the lemma of the schwartz for the strip s can be recorded in the form f z cos im f z 1 cos im z from this inequality it is easily derived that the function x 7 re

an analogue of hydrodynamic standardization which is accepted for conformal display of half plate for 0 through t we will denote the class of functions f of t for which d f in a certain sense the parameter determines the degree of deviation of the holomorphic display f s 7 s from an identical transformation in particular for all z s the inequality of cos im z cos im f z e 2 which can also be considered as a certain analogue of the lemma of schwartz is performed the theorems of distortion in the geometric theory of functions are understood to be evaluated by the functionals that depend on the values of the function and its derivative at a fixed point in various classes of functions as a rule these estimates characterize the degree of deviation of the display carried out by the functions of this class from an identical transformation in a more general production areas of values of the corresponding functionals are studied we fix the point z 0 in the stripes and enter into consideration for 0 two sets z 0 w e z 0 f z 0 f z 0 w f z 0 e z 0 f z 0 f t the description of these sets allows you to obtain estimates of deviations of display f of class t from an identical

theorem v v goryainov 119 theorem 2 let z 0 x 0 i y 0 fixed point in the strip s and 0 then the set z 0 is a convex shell of the curve z 0 w 1 e 1 cos 2 t 2 cos 2 y 0 ei t 2 y 0 t 0 2 t 2 y 0 in addition in class t 0 there is an accurate inequality f z e z f z 1 e 1 cos 2 im z we note another property of classes t with small values which is expressed in the existence of strips of one leaf theorem 3 let f belong to the class t and 0 2 ln 3 then f is one leaf in the strip z im z y where y is the only one in the interval 0 y 2 the root of the equation cos 2 y e 1 cos 3 2 y 3 note that y 2 for 0 and y 0 with 2 ln 3 this theorem can be considered as an increase in theorem 2 from 1 the following results are due to the fact that class t forms a topological half group regarding the operation of the composition and topology of the locally uniform convergence in the bands considering r t r t 0 as an additive half
