some ratios for the logarithmic block of compression the relationship of the completeness of the exhibiting system with the behavior of integers of the exponential type which turns into zero on the sequence of indicators of the specified system is a well known fact so for example the work 1 2 show that the criterion of completeness in an unlimited convex of the loy area of a special type can be given in terms of such a characteristic of the sequence of zeros n n 1 as the upper logarithmic density l in the distance for brevity the logarithmic block density l lim a ger lim t ger 1 ln a t n 6 at 1 n 1 in connection with the foregoing we believe that obtaining any ratios for the value of l will be useful for the best results in the mentioned issues of completeness we will consider the positively non flowing after the milking of material numbers with the only maximum point by n n 1 we mean the numbering of this sequence without taking into account multiples we will denote the multiplicity of the point n through n and then the very multiple of the following n n n 1 denote the letter according to lemm 3 2 of the work 1 the limit of a 1 is always related so the value of l is determined correctly we also need to enter the following values into consideration lim n n 1 n 2 84 a f kuzhaev a i rafikov lim n n n lim n n n it is clear that 1 we will assume that everywhere in the long term sheet if the nasty is not stipulated for the the value 1 is considered after the pre finishment if then instead of and we will write simply theorem let 0 and 6 1 then the assessment ln 6 l 6 ln is fair consequence let there be a value and simultaneously 6 0 and 6 1 then the formula l ln is fair l and t r a t r a 1 malliavinp rubel l a on small entire functions of expo nental type with given zeros bulletin de la smf 1961 t 89 s 175 206 2 habibullinb n the completeness of systems exhibits and many uniqueness ufa ric bashgu 2012 176 p
