abstract sweeping in the theory of functions the concept of estimates for the first time arose in the theory of potential in a poincare its abstract interpretation is also possible see 1 2 let k x sets and t s x r urb two functionality s sweeping t relative to x if t k 6 s k for any k k for the case when x is a vector grill k is a convex cone and t and s are linear positive functionality for x it is supposed to discuss the application of such estimates to a number of topics of the theory of the functions of one and several complex variables such as non triviality of weight classes of holomorphic functions theorems non uniqueness for such classes of functions description of the zero sets of functions from such classes presentation of measorphic functions in the form of private holomorly functions with certain minimal characteristics the existence of a holomorphic function multiplier extinguishing the growth of some in advance of a given function the completeness of exponential and such systems in various spaces of the functions of a complex or material variable the stability of objects from previous points with various variants of their variation a distinctive feature of the application of the method of estimates to the listed areas is its non constructive nature where with traditional approaches a more or less clear construction of an object or their family with certain properties was required it is possible to replace such a check of a certain a priori system of inequalities the study was carried out with the support of the rfff project no 03 01 00033 and the foundation support for leading scientific schools project nsh 1528 2003 1 39 l and t r a t r a 1 akilov g p kutateladze s s streamlined vector about wanders novosibirsk science 1978 367 p 2 khabibullin b n the dual representation of super linen functionals and its application in the theory of functions i ii izvestia ras 2001 t 65 no 4 s 205 224 t 65 no 5 s 167 190 a s holuevo moscow holevo genesis mi ras ru on the hypothesis of additivity in quantum theory of information a whole class of information in the quantum theory of information simply formulated but still not amenable concerns the aditivity of a number of characteristics of the quantum channel relations of the type of classic throughput or maximum purity of the output state in relation to the operation of the tensor work of the channels this question is closely related to the purely mathematical problem of multiplier s multiplier quite positive display describing the channel all known results including a numerical audit are in accordance with this hypothesis a positive solution to this problem would mean in particular that the use of adherent states does not increase classical throughput and would be important for quantum information theory the report gives a formulation of a number of additivity multiplicity problems the relationship between them is investigated and the proof of partial results confirming the hypothesis is discussed 40
