geometric optics in a three dimensional riman space in the maple package t a zhakkova tatar state humanitarian and pedagogical university according to the geometric interpretation of the farm principle at the limit of geometric optics in an optically transparent anisotropic and heterogeneous environment with the refractive tensor of the nik x 64 photon trajectory light of light coincides with the geodetic line in the riman space with the metric tensor gik x nik x thus the entire geometric optics of an optically transparent heterogeneous anisotropic environment boils down to the theory of geodetic in a three dimensional riman space with an euclidean signature of metric so the equations of the spread of light in a transparent heterogeneous and anisotropic environment take the form d 2 x 2 d 2 ijk dxj dxk dxk d 0 1 where ij k 12 igjk jgik kgij optical symbols of the christoffel i th i th genus ijk n jl jk l optical symbols of christoffel of the ii genus here are three demonstration examples of the study with specific cases of the spread of light rays in optically heterogeneous media using a package of maple programs 1 the study of the focusing properties of an optical environment with flat symmetry 8 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 x 8 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 y 2000 1500 1000 500 0 z 0 5 0 7 0 8 0 9 v rho 1 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 1 v phi 1800 1600 1400 1200 1000 800 600 400 200 0 v z fig 1 fig 2 the geometry of the initially parallel bundle of light rays in the anisotropic and heterogeneous optical cut 65 de with flat symmetry is investigated when the optical properties of the medium depend on the direction of the beam of light and the coordinate z we create graphs of geodetic tubes fig 1 and graphs of phase trajectories fig 2 according to generated initial conditions as a result the obtained geodetic and phase trajectories are combined on one graph 2 the study of the focusing properties of the optical environment with cylindrical symmetry 10 5 0 5 10 x 10 5 0 10 y 1 2 1 0 8 0 6 0 4 0 2 0 z 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 vx 1 0 5 0 0 5 1 vy 0 4 0 3 0 2 0 1 vz fig 3 fig 4 the geometry of the initially parallel bundle of light rays in anisotropic and heterogeneous optical environment with cylindrical symmetry is investigated we create graphs of geodetic tubes fig 3 and graphs of phase trajectories fig 4 according to generated initial conditions as a result the obtained geodetic and phase trajectories are combined on one graph 3 a study of the dispersion of light rays in an anisotropic optical environment with flat symmetry the equations of colored rays in the dispersing heterogeneous anisotropic optical environment with flat symmetry are investigated the behavior of three rays of different colors has been studied red green blue 66
