the stability of mole free mole molen holes in the physical literature is called topological pens connecting the remote areas of spaces or bridges connecting various universes to date static mole holes are quite well studied mole burrs with geometry depending on time and rotating croces 73 are less studied the purpose of our work is to study the stability of rotating mole nice this is a difficult task so we will consider the model of a mole hole obtained from spaces time of black holes this technique was used earlier for the analysis of the stability of a spherically symmetrical mole hole 1 in the case of a spherical symmetry the method is as follows consider two identical spaces time of the schwarzshild 2 ds 2 1 2 m r dt 2 dr 2 2 m r r 2 d 2 sin 2 d 2 where the parameter m is asymptotic mass i e the mass that an infinitely remote observer sees in each of the spaces time we delete the four dimensional region 1 2 r 1 2 6 a a 2 m and identify the received sets along the border 1 2 the space time space obtained as a result of this procedure contains two asymptotically flat areas connected by a crop hole the neck of the skeletal hole is the surface the tensor of energy pulse has a great value from zero only on the neck r a to analyze the dynamics of a mole in 1 the parameter a is supposed to depend on time a t in this case einstein s equations take the form 2 2 m a 2 a 2 1 2 a where and is the surface density of energy and surface tension on the neck r a t respectively analysis of einstein s equations and stability requirements lead to a limitation of an asymptotic mass of mole hole m 0 in the case of a positive asymptotic mass the radius of the neck of the mole burns either turns to zero for a 74 unit period of time or increases unlimitedly and therefore the decision under m 0 is unstable this work is devoted to the construction and study of a model of a rotating mole hole l and t r a t r a 1 visser m lorentzian wormholes from einstein to hawking washington washington university 1995 2 landau l d lifshits e m field theory m science 1973 r a kayumov i z mukhamedova v v khammatova kazan state architectural and construction university muhamedova 78 mail ru development of a model of deformation of tissue composite materials in the stream of reduced pressure plasma taking into account taking into account physical non linearity modification of textile materials in the stream of high frequency plasma of reduced pressure can improve the operational properties of tissues and tissue composite materials tcm the creation of mathematical models for deforming tissue composites modified in the stream of high frequency plasma of reduced pressure allows firstly to significantly reduce the number of experiments in the analysis of the formality of the material secondly it allows model 75
