arbitrary functions systems as you know 1 polynomial incisions according to t systems are determined by the number of alterninance points with a fixed pair of continuous on the segment a b functions g g g x g x x a b the task of terribly is closely related to the task of polynoma with extreme coefficients 2 the work considers a situation where the initial system of basic functions is not necessarily a t system let ln an a posn a 1 n ai r ln g g p ln g p g the next two theorems are fair theorem 1 let 0 1 n 1 is a linearly independent system of continuous functions in order for any pair g g in condition ln g g 6 and any function n in ln g g there was the only polin with the largest smallest coefficient at n it is necessary and enough for the 0 system 1 n 1 was a t system theorem 2 let l 0 n g g 6 if 0 1 n 1 is a t system then the pair g g gives rise exactly two terrible according to the system 0 1 n if l 0 n g g but ln g g 6 then the couple g g gots either one or infinitely many heels according to the same system l and t r a t r a 1 dzyadik v k introduction to the theory of uniform approximation of the functions of polynomas m science 1975 510 p 2 zagirov n sh polynomials with extremal coefficents and sna kes east j approx 1995 v i no 2 p 231 248 109
