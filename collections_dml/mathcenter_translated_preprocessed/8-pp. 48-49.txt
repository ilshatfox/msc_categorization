polynomials generated by chain multiple exhibits of an infinitely frequent exhibit or as it can still be called endless chain exhibitor with the coefficients of the sequence an 0 f z a 0 lim n ea 1 z e a 2 z e an 1 z e an z def a 0 ez a 1 a 2 converges in the area s and s k z z 1 e a where a lim n ger an imes see 1 2 its series of taylor in the vicinity of the point z 0 is recorded in the form f z a 0 ger n 0 h n n lim n h n n 1 n e a where 1 h n i 1 in n n i 1 i 2 in i 1 i 2 i 2 i 3 in 1 in a 1 i 1 a 2 i 2 aniin if the sequence an 0 starting from a certain number k 0 is periodic i e ak 0 ml j j j 1 2 m l 0 1 then the convergence is guaranteed in the open circle k radius 1 e where max 1 j m j in 3 48 system m systems of non linear differential equations of the 1 st order is given see formulas 1 and 2 which has a system from m periodic chain exhibits by its solution in general min 1 j m j and the radius of convergence will be the pain by reducing the upper limit 1 at m 2 see 3 and the literature quoted there this upper limit can be calculated for f z ez by information of form h n from the coefficients a 2 k a 2 k 1 k 0 1 2 to politnaya from two variables with m 3 this limit is also calculated by assessing the form h n of the ott coefficients 1 2 m which is represented in the form of h n 1 m k 1 km n n k 1 2 this is a polych nth degree from m arguments one of its main properties lies in the fact that with any natural n and m and with 1 2 m equality h n n 1 n 1 n is performed l and t r a t r a 1 barrow d f infinite exponentials american math month 1936 v 43 p 150 160 2 bulanov a p rugularity of degrees of infinite brief izvestia of the academy of sciences of the russian federation ser matte 1998 t 62 no 5 c 49 78 3 bulanov a p movement of one dynamic system modern problem theories of functions and their adj thesis dokl 10 th saratov winter school saratov 2000 s 24 25 v d bystritsky a a ryabinin nizhny novgorod transformation of fourier stiltesi singular functions 49
