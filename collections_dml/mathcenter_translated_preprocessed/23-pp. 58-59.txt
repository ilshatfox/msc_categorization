several results about e prisoners and p production of computable numbers let and two computable numbers of the set s they say that e prison p prison to if there is such a recursive number w the navigable function f that s 1 s x y x y w y 1 s respectively s 1 s x y y df x dy 1 s where x y is the cantor number of pairs x y natural numbers from n and dn is a canonical number of the final subset n the existence of computable families of the final sets and the overall functions that do not have e main numbering is proved in 1 it is noted that there is a computable numbering of the family 0 1 0 1 0 1 2 3 0 3 to which the p vydima is notable it is further proved that 1 if some numbering p prison to the calculated numbering of the three element family of recursive and enrolling sets then it is computable 60 2 there is a computable numbering of the family 0 1 0 1 to which e vydima is inexpensive l and t r a t r a 1 degtev a n on the numbering to which the p prisoners are unsuccessful mat notes 1987 t 42 no 5 s 723 728 v g puzarenko novosibirsk vagrig math nsc ru about the properties of permissible sets by the author studies the ratios between the ratio of the properties of the descriptive theory of sets on permissible sets for this methods of both the classical theory of computing and the theory of sets and the theory of models are used first we recall some basic definitions model a signature is called a permissible set if a is the model kpu and a fundamally we limit ourselves to the consideration of the permissible sets of only the final signature an important example of the permissible set is the hereditary final superstructure let m the signature model with the main set m then hf 0 m m hfn 1 m hfn m p hfn m where n p x is many final subsidence of the set x hf m n pi m in this case hf m is a hereditary superstructure over the model m considered as a signature model u where uhf m m on permissible sets a b can be set n a b predicates as predicates defined in a formulas and formulas at the same time partial function f is called a calculated if f a v p predicat it is known that a is a subject on hf m above the model m of the final signature if only if it can be 61
