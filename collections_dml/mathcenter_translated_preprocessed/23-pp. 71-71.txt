gomology groups of categories and asynchronous transition systems is devoted to the applications of homological algebra to study mathematical models of parallel computing systems asynchronous systems of transitions and petri networks monoid is called partially switching if it has an idea e r with the help of many e and many ratios ab ba set for some a b e each monoid representation corresponds to some 2 cathegoria r the properties of which were the properties of which were studied by b mitchal 1 the author received the following result theorem let e r a presentation of a partially switching monoid if there are no triples of various elements a b c e for which ab ba bc cb and ac ca then 2 category r is trivial the arbitrary asynchronous system of transitions can be considered as the punctured right m nomotion over a partial communicative monoid m elements of this set will be the conditions of the asynchronous transition system let k x category of states its objects are elements x x for an arbitrary category groups of homologies and homological dimension are determined 2 consequence if the asynchronous system of transitions does not have triples of pair of independent events then the homological dimension of its category of states is not more than 2 hypothesis if the asynchronous transition system does not have n 1 in pairs of independent events then the homological dimension of its category of states is not more than n l and t r a t r a 1 mitchell b rings with several objects adv math 1972 v 8 p 1 161 2 husainov a homological dimension theory of small categories j math sci new york 2002 v 110 no 1 p 2273 2321 73
