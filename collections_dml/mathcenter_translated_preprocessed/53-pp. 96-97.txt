the differential equation for a function displaying a single circle to a curved polygon of a special type this work continues the research that began in 1 we fix the numbers r let the single legged region b of the extended complex plane w satisfy the condition of the condition 1 0 6 organs b b 2 b nk 1 lk i e the boundary of the region b consists of the final number of arcs of lk each of which when choosing a regular branch of transformation w i passes into an arc of a circle with a center at a point cil 0 or a radial ray of a plane hole 3 each point ak 1 6 k 6 n is the top of the curvoline n angle b is the achieved boundary point of the region b if several angular points are located at some point of the plane w then the same will be the top if the above conditions 1 3 are performed for the single link area b of the expanded compel plane w then area b is called the area that satisfies the condition 1 they say that the function f obeys the condition 1 if it satisfies the following conditions 1 f z is regular in the punctured circle e 0 z 1 and has a simple pole at the beginning of the coordinates s r mironov l d pogodin 97 2 f z one leaf displays the punctured circle e on the lastrate b satisfying the condition 1 theorem if the function f subordinates the condition 1 then it satisfies the usual differential equation of the type f z 1 2 1 i 3 i f z f z 2 p z where p z n k 1 1 2 k 2 z k 2 ck z ak here ck is some complex constants k inside the angles in the vertices of ak region b f e f z about the egmarly suture of the function f l and t r a t u r a 1 mironova s r pogodina l d the display of a single circle to a curved polygon of a special type mater 14 th all russian youth scientific school honf ka dawn publishing house kazan matte general publishing house of the academy of sciences of the republic of tatarstan 2015 t 52 p 100 101 2 golusing m the geometric theory of functions of a complex alternating m nauka 1966 628 p
