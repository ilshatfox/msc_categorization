new modifications of the concept of analytical capacity the concept of analytical capacity of sets plays a very noticeable role in modern complex analysis along with the main analytical capacity the capacity of alfors its modifications were also used in the definitions of which the potentials of koshi with different types of measures were involved complex real or positive uniting for all these concepts was the use of limited analytical functions for the capacity of alforts it was the whole class of such analytical in the field of g g functions f z which f z 6 1 f 0 and for the above modifications subclasses of this class consisting of the functions represented by the potentials of kosh with certain measures in the recently preprint of young spanish mathematician x tolsa 1 a sensational result was obtained on the equivalence of the capacity of alforts and all its marked modifications in 298 1 an extensive bibliography of works related to the development of these concepts and their applications was also given in this work we will deal with the new modifications of the analytical capacity associated with the functions lying under arbitrary majority while the identical unit was still major let g an arbitrary area of an extended complex plane g f a compact that is the addition of the g a f linear space of analytical on f functions c f the space of continuous to f complex functions with the usual norm in g the continuous function h z 0 is set through bh we denote the space of analytical functions f z for which f h sup z f z h z urb f 0 each analytical in g function determines the nonlinear functionality of lf so far without continuity lf y 1 2 i d f z y z dz y a f 1 where d f is some canonical surroundings f such that y z is analytical in d d generally speaking its own for each y z we agree in some designations or d d measures complex or d a measure which is a complete variation of the measure sose is a compact media of the measure we consider measures only with such carriers z the potential of koshi measures defined outside f we introduce into a f the prenatal p y inf s h z d sa g f 1 2 theorem 1 v p khavin 2 the bh space is associated with space a f equipped with a prenature 2 moreover the norm of linear functionality lf of 1 is f h and p y sup f h 61 lf y v p khavin proves in detail these facts for h z 1 but in a comment 1 at the end of the work it gives the result now we note the slight inaccuracy of this important work 2 the lack of standardization f 0 however already in the keta theorem quoted in 2 without this normalization the analytical function f z representing the functionality 1 is not the only one because f z c with any constant c represents the same functionality we denote through kh the class of complex measures s f for which z bh and z 6 1 299 theorem 2 let ai counting dense in g and c f then sup shiph f d inf i lim n n 1 h ai i 3 where the inf is taken by all such sequences i that n 1 i ai n n in c f 4 if there are no sequences with property 4 then extremums b 3 are equal to icles now we will introduce the following modifications of the analytical capacity h f sup f h 61 1 2 i d f z dz kh f sup orkh f d sup shiph 1 2 i d z dz of theorems 1 and 2 dual expressions are obtained for these quantities and it is obvious that kh f 6 h f due to the fact that we always have f 0 it is natural to impose the requirement of h z z 1 o 1 z urb 5 drying 1 if the weight h z satisfies the condition 5 then with h f 0 the bh space contains only f z 0 and with kh f 0 class kh contains only meru 0 sentenger 2 let them exist a the sequence of canonical areas g n exhausting g b analytical in g function z z 6 0 z g urb 1 v number m 0 such as g n h z z dz 6 m then h f kh f let the angle in the plane w with the top at the point w 0 and the bisector according to the positive real semi shaft open area the sides of the corner do not belong to it the solution of the angle is denoted by the same letter and we assume 300 that 6 we denote through e many of those functions from a f for which y f e cone in a f theorem 3 in order for the measure 1 i 2 on f where 1 and 2 are material measures satisfied the condition re f y d y eear it is necessary and enough for the measure 1 tg 2 2 6 was positive we denote the class of measures satisfying the condition 6 through k in the case of the inclusion k means simply that 0 theorem 4 in order for the analytical in g function f z f 0 it has the view f z z k it is necessary and sufficient to relf
