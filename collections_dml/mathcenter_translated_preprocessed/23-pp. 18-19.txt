the theory of the opead and the universal algebra in recent years have published three monographs dedicated to the theory of the opead 1 2 3 in the work of the author 4 a more general definition is given thanks to which an abstract clones can be considered a special case of the concept of operates this means that each variety of universal algebra is essentially accurately up to rational equivalence there is a variety of algebra over a certain opera the situation can be described informally as follows the theory of the algebra varieties over the operates and the theory of diversity which are traditionally awarded with the help of symbols of operations and identity correlate approximately the same as the total 20 theory of groups and the combinatorial theory of groups the report is supposed to consider three circles of issues firstly the direction associated with the continuation of work 4 see in particular 5 secondly the use of linear operating theory to the study of the varieties of superlgebr and finally the foundations of the theory of equivalence of morita for the varieties of linear algebra over the operas the simplest case is considered in 6 7 the general case is obtained using a new operational analogue of the module endomorphism ring the work was supported by rocr rt project no 05 5 1284 l and t r a t r a 1 smirnov v a simplied and operating methods in algebrai topology m publishing house factorial press 2002 272 p 2 markl m shnider s stasheff j operads in algebra topology and physics ams math surveys and monographs v 96 2002 349 p 3 leinster t higher operads higher categories london math soc lect notes ser cambr univ press 2003 380 p 4 trinin s n abstract clones and operates sib mat journal 2002 t 43 no 4 s 924 936 5 trinin s n on the characterization of the varieties of the algebrus over w opeads interenor algebr confer dedicu 250 th anniversary of moscow university and 75 th anniversary of kaf higher algebra tez reports m publishing house of mehmat msu 2004 s 127 128 6 tronin s n kopp o a matrix linear operates izv universities mathematics 2000 no 6 s 53 62 7 kapranov m manin yu modules and morita theorem for operad american j math 2001 v 123 no 5 p 811 838 21
