direct limits of hv modules in this paper the category of hv modules is considered also it is shown that the direct limit of every direct system always exist in this category direct limit are defined by a universal property and so are unique the most powerful tool in order to obtain a module from a given hv module is the quotient out procedure by use this method some results about the connection between the fundamental modules direct systems and direct limits is proved by considering the fundamental equivalence relation b solon ivanovo russia solon icti ivanovo su quasi minimality is a synonym of the non totality of enumeration degree we use notations and terminology similar to those of the monograph 1 we recall as 2 that a e b a is enumeration reducible to b if there is a uniform algorithm for enumerating a given any enumeration of b formally a e b n x x a u x u wn du b let as usual a e b a e b b e a and de a b b e a be e degree of a and de a de b a e b denote by de the set of e degrees partially ordered by and by 0 e the least element of de an e degree a is called non total if in it there are no total functions which are identified with their graphs let tot be the set of all total e degrees the first example of a non total e degree has given by medvedev 3 the medvedev s e degrees were named by case 4 quasi minimal later a is quasiminimal iff 0 e a f tot f a f 0 e 75
