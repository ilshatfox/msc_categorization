the diffraction of electromagnetic waves on the branching in a flat waveguard filled with anisotropic dielectric k r khadiev kazan state university kamilhadi gmail com is the task of diffraction of electromagnetic waves on the branching of a flat waved a zetropic dielectric which is a cold plasma the anisotropy of the environment is manifested as follows dielectric permeability 1 0 i 2 0 3 0 i 2 0 1 while the magnetic permeability of 1 the properties of the waves of the waveguide are the same as in the isotropic case the anisotropy manifests itself when considering tm waves when solving the helmholtz equation the component in the field of the field at 21 22 ex 1 0 2 x i 1 z hy x z ez 1 0 2 z z i 1 x hy x z here hy a x e x where is its own values and x is own functions for own functions the condition is not fulfilled but the condition of the biralonality of 212 h 0 is fulfilled 2 x 1 x x 2 x 1 x 0 6 n const 6 constance 6 constance 6 constance 6 constance 6 constance 6 constance 6 constance 6 const 0 we introduce the following designations h x 0 h x ex x 0 e x ez x 0 q x then equality are true h x a x x e x 1 0 a y q x 1 0 a q using the condition of bioponiality it is possible to obtain the condition of the condition of a 1 n h 0 h x y x e x 0 x x dx when stitching the parts of the waveguide the following equations are obtained by the parts of the tangent components of the vectors d 0 e and b 0 h 1 e a x 2 q a x 1 e 0 x 2 q 0 x 1 e b x 2 q b x 1 e c x 2 q c x where h 0 x e 0 x q 0 x are functions corresponding to the spreading wave bllau was obtained regarding the coefficients of a which is solved by truncation 213 l and t r a t r a 1 r mittra s lee analytical methods of the theory of the volodov m mir 1974 graded algebras li small rank n a khorev nizhny novgorod state university named after n i lobachevsky khorevana mail ru an important role in the classification of simple algebris lee over the al closed field of the field k characteristics p 0 game the recognition theorem of v katz 1 proven in 3 for p 3 this one the theorem gives a description of the graduated algebris l r i q li where l 0 is the direct sum of the classic algebris li l 1 is an ignorant l 0 module the negative part is born l and 1 and the condition of transitivity is fulfilled if x li i 0 x 6 0 then x l 1 6 0 in the case of p 3 the recognition theorem is proved in 2 for q 1 in this work the graduated algebras of the characteristics 3 with the local part l 1 l 0 l 1 where l 0 is sl 2 or gl 2 in the algebr lee class generated by the local part there is the only minimum algebra which is the algebra factor of the algebra lee generated by forming l 1 l 0 l 1 and the ratios that are performed in the local part according to the only maximum degree ideal which has a trivial the intersection with the local hour the following results were obtained theorem let l the endedly graduated algebra lee over the algebraically closed field characteristics of 214
