criteria of one leafness and complete permissibility for p harmonic functions to the issue of monolithic analytical in d z c z 1 of the functions a large number of works are devoted many criteria of one leafy analytical functions are available for harmonic functions only a few criteria of one legged is known for p harmonic in d functions only sufficient conditions of one legged are known the function f c 2 p d p n is called p harmonic see 1 if pf 0 v d where is laplace operator 50 k f amozova e g ganenkova is known see 3 that the function f c 2 p d is p harmonic and only when f has the following idea f z p k 1 z 2 k 1 fp k 1 z 1 where each function is fp k 1 hp k 1 gp k 1 ger n 0 a p k 1 n z n b p k 1 n z n k 1 p is harmonic in d the authors have received a criterion of one leafy for p garmo in d functions in terms of their coefficients theorem 1 let f z single leaf in some surroundings of zero p harmonic in d function of the species 1 the function f z is single in d z d 0 t 0 2 the following condition is fulfilled p k 1 z 2 k 1 n 1 a p k 1 n z n b p k 1 n z n sinnt sin t 6 0 by analogy with p harmonic functions cream teria a single leaf for p analytical functions i e the functions of the form f z p and 1 k 0 z kak z where ak z is analytical in d functions in 5 p lichberski and v v starkov they determined the achievable region region rn 0 is called permissible relative to 0 0 1 if for each point p there is such a number r r p 0 that the cone k p r x r n x p p p x p cos 2 x p 6 r is contained in rn k f amozova e g ganenkova 51 they proved that the perilative areas are about the condition of the cone and that the cigarette boggorphic in from the covered single euclidean ball dn n 1 the functions f dn cn f 0 0 displaying dn on the periocent region they have the property of heredity inherit peridity i e if r 0 1 then each area f rdn lodging it is known that in the class of harmonic functions f c c f 0 0 preserving orientation in d the property of the bulge or starship of the region f d is not inherited in such cases the subclass is distinguished and considered quite a convex quite star shaped functions that have their own heredity see 4 we will say that the p harmonic function f f 0 0 is quite permissible 0 1 if for each r 0 1 f displays dr z ser co z r in the perceptive region the criterion of complete permissibility for p harmonic functions is obtained theorem 2 let f z p harmonic in d function 1 f 0 0 and jf z 0 in d then f is quite percussion 0 1 z d the condition is performed p k 1 z 2 k 1 re z h p k 1 f g p k 1 f sin 2 f a 2 z b 2 z where a z re z p k 1 z 2 k 1 h p k 1 g p k 1 b z im z p k 1 z 2 k 1 himate k 1 g p k 1 as a result we receive a criterion of complete pergimim for biharmonic p 2 harmonic p 1 as well as a well known criterion see 6 2 for analytical p 1 g g 1 g g 1 g 0 in d functions also a criterion of complete starship case 0 for p harmonic harmonic p 1 52 k f amozova e g ganenkova 4 and analytical p 1 g 0 well known starship condition z f z f z 0 in d functions the work was performed with financial support for the program of strategic development petrgu and the rffi project 14 01 00510 l and t r a t r a 1 balkm b polyanalytic functions and their generalizations results of science and technology ser modern problem matte foundation directions 1991 t 85 c 187 246 2 brannand a and kirwanw e online classes of bounded university functions j london math soc 1969 v 2 no 1 c 431 443 3 chen sh ponnusamy s and wangx bloch constant and landau s theorem for planar p harmonic mappings j math anal appl 2011 v 373 no 1 c 102 110 4 chuaquim durenp and osgoodb curvature properties of planar harmonic mappings comput methods funct theory 2013 v 4 no 1 c 127 142 5 liczberski p and starkov v v domains in rn with confessible boundary j math anal appl 2013 v 408 no 2 c 547 560 6 stankiewicz j queelques probl mes extr maux dans leasses des fonuctions angulairement toil es ann univ mariae curie sklodowska sectio a 1966 v xx c 59 75
