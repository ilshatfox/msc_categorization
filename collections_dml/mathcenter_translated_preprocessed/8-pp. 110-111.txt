the limitations of nonlinear integrated functionals are known 1 that if the superposition operator fx f s x s where the function f s x satisfies the conditions of karateodori translates the space l prim r to l 1 r then the norms of its values are limited on each ball of the space linger r this is equivalent to the fact that the functionality is x 0 f s x s ds is defined on lux r and is limited on each ball of this space it turns out that this statement is also true in the case when the functionality is determined on a narrower set the bc r space continuous and limited to r functions with the norm x sup t favor t we denote through the class of integral functionals defined on bc r and having the form fx 0 f s x s ds 1 where the core is the function f s x satisfies the conditions of karateodori the following statements are fair theorem 1 any functionality from class m is limited on each ball of the bc r space 110 theorem 2 any functionality from class m using formula 1 can be continued on the space of l prim r and at the same time it will be limited on every ball of this space l and t r a t r a 1 krasnoselsky m a et al integral operators in the spaces of the summarized functions m science 1966 v i ivanov cheboksary the construction of almost periodic solutions of the first regional problem of the theory of elasticity for the area consisting of a strip and half plate a region consisting of a homogeneous izotropic elastic strip y h 0 h 0 ura x mm and the same half plate y 0 urb x is in equilibrium on the direct connection of y 0 the conditions of rigid adhesion are set u 1 x 0 u 2 x 0 v 1 x 0 v 2 x 0 1 y x 0 2 y x 0 1 xy x 0 2 xy x 0 on the straight line y h the boundary conditions of the 1 st kind are set 1 y x h f x 1 xy x h g x it is required to find stress functions j x x y j y x y j xy x y j 1 2 and movements u j j x y v j x y in a given area the solution to the problem is built in the space of almost periodic functions in the sense of boron with the help of generalized discrete 111
