uae sea water intrusion problem mathematical models versus field studies new analytical solutions are presented to a problem of steady state abrupt interface sea water intrusion into a coastal unconfined aquifer with uniformly distributed losses along a phreatic surface two free surfaces encroachment tongue and groundwater table intersect with a horizontal water table of the resting sea water intruded conformal mappings of the physical domain and of an unknown complex potential domain onto an auxiliary half plane are obtained by a modified method of polubarinovakochina which is mathematically reduced to a vector riemann boundaryvalue problem similarly to kacimov and obnosov 2001 the tongue does not originate at the beach slope as in standard models i e groundwater is discharging not into the sea but through the water table only free surfaces are found for different values of losses densities of the two fluids sea water and incident groundwater hydraulic heads comparisons with the dupuit forcheimer hydraulic model based on a nonlinear ode are done geophysical surveying based on ac voltage pulses is conducted in al hail site oman later shallow boreholes were drilled and water samples were analysed physically and chemically the results confirmed complete salinisation of the near shore zone and the mathematical model surface geophysical study using dc sources in wadi ham uae showed that sufficiently far from the beach line shallow groundwater is still not salinised practical implications of geophysics and mathematics in catchment scale groundwater management are discussed acknowledgements this study was supported by the joint sultan qaboos university united arab emirates university collaboration project cl squ uaeu 0 3 01 and by the russian foundation for basic research grants n 03 01 00015 03 01 96193 and n 05 5 1 265 2003 f 05 tas r e f e r e n c e s 1 kacimov a r obnosov yu v analytical solution for a sharp interface problem in sea water intrusion into a coastal aquifer proceedings royal society london a 2001 v 457 2016 p 3023 3038 112
