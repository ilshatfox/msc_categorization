a study of the sustainability of the mathematical model of the dynamics of the population of seaweed by the stability and stability of ecological simm is possible by studying mathematical models used to describe the dynamics of environmental communications the issues of sustainability are related to the issues of the rational operation of natural resources the assessment of the limits of environmental pollution as well as the forecast of the consequences of the anthropogenic impact on the environmental system 1 the purpose of this study is to study the stability of the dynamic model that describes the processes of growth and development of algae biomass 2 t t s x t 1 x 1 x 1 x t xm u t d sn s t t x t onic s 1 i v testova n a shilova 145 where is the rate of change in the biomass of algae and the end of the centralization of biogenic substances in the environment s t ks s t a trophic function of moscow but d is the coefficient of the duct sn the concentration of biogenic substances in the environment before the beginning of the growing season is the coefficient of the reflective the reflecting grew algae to a unit of consumed biogenicity substances xmax the maximum of who poy possible in the biomay of algae for the simplicity of solving the problem we assume that t const ks xmax d sn i u 0 and the system 1 will introduce in the form s ks s x 1 x xm u 0 d sn s x s ks s 0 2 we get two stationary points 1 0 sn 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 xm 0 5 xm d ks sn 2 4 snks xm d ks sn 4 to study the inpatient state of the system whether the system 2 is in the vicinity of the equilibrium position by decomposing functions in a series of taylor the absence of limit cycles of phase trajectories was proved by the power of the bendixon criterion for this about 146 i v testov n a shilov f x g s where f f x s s ks s x 1 x xm u g g x s d sn s x s ks s and it is shown that the expression f x g s for any pair x s r 2 it is sympathetic and different from zero indeed f x g s 0 since us ks s 2 x xm 1 d x ks ks s 2 0 for any pair x s r 2 then according to the bendixon criterion the system 2 does not have closed circuits trajectory the absence of limit cycles allows you to explore the stem using the linearization procedure in the vicinity of the balance of equilibrium linearized system 2 in the vicinity of the point is equal to this 3 in the first approximation it has the form 1 sn ks sn x 1 1 ds 1 sn ks sn x 1 5 where x 1 x 0 1 x 1 s 1 s 0 1 s 1 and x 1 s 1 small increments of values x 1 s 1 in the vicinity of the point 0 sn analysis of the roots of the characteristic equation of the system 5 showed that the equilibrium position 3 is an unstable saddle figure 1 a similarly it was shown that i v testov n a shilova 147 the stationary point 4 of the system 2 is a stable uz figure 1 b a b fig 1 phase portrait of the dormant points of the system an additional study of the stability of the equilibrium position was carried out using numerical meals by varying the initial states of phase tracts of the effect near the equilibrium position the results of a numerical analysis which was implemented in the delphi 7 0 environment showed that special points 3 and 4 systems 2 are an unstable saddle and a stable node respectively the results obtained are of practical significance and can be used to determine the range of the stability of organisms in changing environmental conditions based on changes in sustainability indicators the capabilities of the body of movs can be determined to changes in the changes in the biotic and abiotic factors of the environment the work was carried out with financial support from the rffi for a minimum project no 14 01 98800 l and t r a t r a 1 mamedovat f trevye v lyapina a the stability of mathematical models of the predator victim type news of higher educational institutions volga region 148 i a turagin physical and mathematical sciences mathematics no 2 22 2012 s 98 105 2 andreeva a shilovan a mathematical models and optimal strategy in the use and preservation of population resources mathematical methods of managing tver tvsu 2010 c 20 30 i a turygina research institute of mechanics of national research nizhny novgorod state university named after n i lobachevsky hodykinna gmail com numerical modeling of the interaction of shock waves with multilayer deformable barriers of wicker nets multi layer gas proof barriers are an fective means of protecting the structure from the effects of shock waves hc such obstacles are layers of metal wicker nets and are used to reduce ampl
