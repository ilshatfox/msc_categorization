university during the work was familiarized with the methods of describing the structure of bone tissue and models of physical and evolutionary ratios on the basis of the selected mathematical model an algorithm for solving the task of restructuring the bone structure under the influence of pressure a numerical experiment and the results were implemented and the results were obtained keywords mathematical modeling non mogenic media computed tomography when solving the problems of biomechanics in the section of the human musculoskeletal system it is necessary to describe the stress deformed state of bone tissue given the change in its structure over time 1 3 therefore there is a need to obtain a method due to which a change in the structure of bone tissue will be quantitatively described under the influence of constant load wolf s law is a law describing bone behavior under the influence of various factors in particular the load due to changes in the load restructuring of bone tissue begins wolf s law says the bone adapts its structure to the loads that it should withstand 4 in equilibrium the main axis of the tensor of deformations should coincide with the main axes of the deviator of the tensor of the structure the main axes of the tensors coincide if their scalar work is switching when building a model it was implied that the material is isotropic and non sophisticated from the assumption of the presence of a connection between physical density and mechanical characteristics the optical density was used to calculate the yunga module and maximum stresses the main idea is to build a relationship between a finite element net and ct data to do this it is necessary to determine the coefficients of weakening in the nodes on a sampled set which represents a set of data of nodes and elements next the mechanical characteristics are completely settled for each element which allows being in elastic production to use classic final elements evolutionary relationships are known from literature 4 describing changes in the structure of the spongy bone under the influence of various loads the cohen model allows you to express nine components of the orthotropy tensor through the normalized own values of the structure of the structure the second invariant of the structure of the structure and nine functions of the density of the bone matrix 1 3 the construction of geometry and the calculation were carried out in the universal software 222 lobachevsky readings 2019 system of the ansys of of course in the calculations the type of the final element solid 185 with linear approximation was used on the lower surface of the model we limit the movement in all directions we will apply the pressure on the upper surface an iteration process of step by step definition of unknown on each time layer was implemented to determine the quality of the restructuring of the bone structure vat visualization and the distribution of porosity in fixed moments of time were implemented when solving 320 iterations were used and a step in time the step is about 1 2 hours in the first calculated case the paintings of the distribution of changes in the proportion of solid material indicate that in a state of homeostatic equilibrium the maximum change in porosity will be observed closer to the upper surface after 122 iterations a gradual decrease in the value of the miserable is observed which suggests that the structure of the structure and tensor of deformation strive for the alignment and the convergence of the mathematical model in the second calculated case the stress in myise reaches an asymptotic value already on the 80 th iteration on the first iteration of the localization of maximum stresses and maximum changes in porosity coincide considering the resulting picture of the distribution of stresses it can be concluded that the maximum normal stresses when the state of homeostatic equilibrium reaches on the lower surface of the model closer to the corners based on the results obtained we can conclude that the bone structure comes into a state of homeostatic balance in about 5 days literature 1 gapta s dan p bone geometry and
