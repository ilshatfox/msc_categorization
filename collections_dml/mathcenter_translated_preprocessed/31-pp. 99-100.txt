continuous display on fractal sets of e n makhrov nizhny novgorod state university named after n i lobachevsky elena makhrova inbox ru in this note examines dendrites with a fractal structure dandrite is understood as a local coherent continuum not containing subset homeomorphic circles in 1 the theorem of the existence of a motionless point in the continuous display of dendritus in itself was proven in 2 it was shown that the fact of the existence of a motionless point in continuous display f on the segment i provided i f i see for example 3 is not generalized in case of arbitrary continuous displays of dendrites theorem let f x x continuous display of dendritus x in itself and there is a final tree y x such that y f y then y per f 6 the approval of the theorem is not fair if y is a dendritus with a counting set of branches of branching consider the following example let the dendrite x and display f x x are defined in the theorem with 4 we denote through o o point with the coordinates 1 2 3 2 a a point with coordinates 1 2 1 ai 1 in the point of intersection of arcs i 1 in i 1 in 0 i 1 in 1 where i 1 in 0 1 determine the dendritis z x o a here o a a segment connecting the points o and a and display g z z putting 1 g o a a 2 g i 1 i 1 o a linear homeomorphism such that g ai 1 o g o a for i 1 0 1 3 g i 1 in i 1 in i 1 in 1 linear homeomorphism 99 such that g ai 1 in ai 1 in 1 for any i 1 in 0 1 n 2 4 g z z if z e x where e x is a lot of end points of dendritis x it is easy to check that g z is a continuous display of dendritis z many periodic points which consists only of motionless points and per g e x a we will predict the display f z to the segment o a believing it equal to the identical for many per f periodic points f the equality of per f z e x is true we put f g f z z then 1 many periodic points of display f consists of a single fixed point a 2 x f x but x per f the work was supported by the rfff project 04 01 00457 l and t r and t r a 1 ayres w some generalizations of the scherrer fixed point theorem fundam math 1930 v 16 p 332 336 2 efremova l s makhova e n on a piece of curly monotonous displays with a closed set of periodic points on dendrites moding matte and her applications 2003 t 8 s 60 75 3 sharkovsky a n the coexistence of the cycles of continuous transformation of the line into himself ukrainian matte journal 1964 no 1 p 61 71 4 efremova l s makhova e n the dynamics of monotonous displays of dendrites matem sat 2001 t 192 no 6 p 15 30 100
