periodic orbits in the dynamics of a piece of side disposures with the parameter of one dimensional discrete dynamic systems are widely used in physics technology biology ecology sociology and other sciences for example when studying simple models of financial markets or constructing environmental and population models dynamic systems are explored data using continuous and piece line diligents in particular symmetric and asymmetric ten shaped display set by a system of two linear functions with one or two parameters see e g 1 5 note that the study of the dynamics of such references reduced serious attention and these models have been studied quite well the next step towards studying tent shaped reflection is the study of the case when the functions in the system are nonlinear we are considering one of the private servants of this task when the function depends on one parameter which allows you to conduct a full study of the dynamics set by 48 i i aksanov d z urazov nogo nonlinear tentine display f x ax 2 0 6 x 6 1 ax 1 x 1 1 as a result the behavior of the orbits of any point x from the area of determination of the function f for all material integrations of parameter a is described of greatest interest is the case a 1 the display here has three motionless and two ultimately motionless points and x 1 0 is attractive x 2 1 a repulsive and x 3 a 1 2 is neither attractive nor repulsive in addition the orbit of all points x of the segment 1 a are two period with the exception of point x 3 double period orbi are of great interest in studying and predicting the number of biological population the mathematical model of which is built as a discrete dynamic system set by the display f the study of dynamics f allows us to conclude that the most favorable conditions for the life and development of the population will be with the meaning of the parameter a 1 and for any values of the variable x from the interval 1 a a 2 in this case the population ultimately will fluctuate between the two values of x and x two peridic orbit which ensures its more bitness as for example in the case of a population of pacific salmon l and t r a t r a 1 al shameriw f h mahiubm a some dynamical properties of the family of tent maps int j of math analysis 2013 v 7 no 29 p 1433 1449 k f amozova e g ganenkova 49 2 lindstromt dynamical properties of maps fitted to data in the noise free limit j of biological dynamics 2013 v 7 no 1 p 108 116 3 sushko i gardini l degenerate bifurcations and border collisions in piecewise smooth 1 d and 2 d maps int j of bifurcation and chaos 2010 v 20 no 7 p 2045 2070 4 tramontanaf gardini l and westerhoff f intricate asset price dynamics and one dimensional discontinous maps in nonlinear economic dynamics new york nova science publishers 2010 5 tramontanaf gardini l puut duopoly games with alternate technologies j econ dyn contr 2008 v 33 p 250 265 k f amozova e g ganenkova petrozavodsky state university amokira rambler ru g ek inbox ru criteria of one legged and complete appropriation for p harmonic functions the issue of one leafness of analytical in d z c z 1 of the functions a large number of works are devoted many criteria of one leafy analytical functions are available for harmonic functions only a few criteria of one legged is known for p harmonic in d functions only sufficient conditions of one legged are known the function f c 2 p d p n is called p harmonic see 1 if pf 0 v d where is laplace operator
