abstract theory of close methods of solving linear problems 1 nb pletshchinsky kazan state university in the lecture discusses the main provisions of abstract theory of approximate methods for solving linear operator equations within the framework of which the theoretical justification of various methods of numerical solutions of boundary problems 1 work was supported by the r d foundation of the republic of tatarstan 55 abstract theory of close methods for differential equations integral equations and a number of other linear tasks examples are considered in the abstract theory of approximate methods of solving linear operator equations based on ideas and methods of functional analysis two main directions can be distinguished in the general theory of close methods of l v kantorovich 1 2 and its version proposed by b g gabdulkhaev 3 the main attention is paid to the conditions under which the permissive equation is permissible from the resolution of the exact equation this approach is most convenient to use in the theoretical substantiation of numerical methods for solving integral equations another direction arose in the study of variable schemes for differential equations here the concept of stability of the sequence of operators that approximate a given operator is significantly used here see for example 4 variable schemes close methods of the galerkin type and some other tasks are considered from a common point of view in the theory of abstract close circuits of v a trenogin 5 ch vii some statements of the general theory of close methods and theory of abstract close circuits are clarified and supplemented in the works 6 7 we also note the book of m a krasnoselsky g m vainikko p p zabreiko ya b rutitsky and v ya stutsenko 8 in which close methods of solving linear and nonlinear operator equations were investigated 1 operators of approximation and interpolations let x y linear normalized spaces a x y is a linear operator determined on a linear diversity in x additive and homogeneous ax y x x y y 1 a linear operator equation which will be called an accurate equation the close method of solving the equation 1 is as follows we choose linear normalized spaces x y and linear operator a x y approximir 56 nb poleshniye accurate according to the exact equation we construct an approximating equation ax y x x y y 2 here the element y is selected according to the element y we find the solution x x of this equation and the corresponding x element x x is the approximate solution of the equation 1 recall some information from the theory of linear operators and linear equations let d a and r a area of determination and area of the values of the operator n a x d a ax 0 many zeros nucleus of the operator a consider the equation 1 three situations are possible either the equation has no solutions or the solution of the equation exists and the only one or the equation has a solution but not the only one it is clear that the solution of equation 1 exists and only when y r a describe the set of r a for this operator a and formulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the resolution of equation 1 equivalent tasks equation 1 can only have one solution and only when n a 0 in this and only in this case there is a left reverse to a operator a 1 l the left reverse operator is determined unambiguously it will certainly be linear since each element from r a can be made in accordance with one of the elements d a the right reverse to a operator a 1 r on r a always exists but in the general case it is non linear when the right reverse to a the operator is determined throughout the entire space y equation 1 is resolved with any right side let the linear operators tx x x and sx x x establish a correspondence between elements of accurate and approximating spaces and txsx ix 3 this means that the sx operator has the left reverse i e e n sx 0 and the tx operator has the right reverse that is r tx x similarly even the linear operators ty y y and sy y y are such that ty sy iy 4 57 abstract theory of close methods we will call tx and ty operators of approximation and sx and sy interpolation operators we assume that d tx x d sx x d ty y d sy y a simple example if x is the space of functions then x txx is a vector of function of function x in nodes and x sxx interpolating polin sxtx and sy ty operators 3 and 4 are projectors from x to x and from y to respectively sxtx 2 sxtx and sy ty 2 sy ty the space x all the better approximates the space x the closer the sxtx operator to the identical operator ix if sxtx ix then a mutual uniform correspondence is established between the elements of spaces x and x to exclude this case we will assume that the sets x sx x and sy y are their own subspace of spaces x and y
