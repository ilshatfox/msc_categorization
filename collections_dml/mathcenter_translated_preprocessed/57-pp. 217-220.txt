various characteristics of non self adjoint ordinary differential operators on the convergence rate of spectral decomposition i s lomov the analysis of the results received by the scientific school of v a ilyin concerning assessment of speed of convergence and equiconvergence with a trigonometrical number of fourier of spectral decomposition of functions on root functions of linear ordinary differential operators both self conjugate and not self conjugate set on a final piece of a numerical straight line is provided the theorem of equiconvergence speed for the so called loaded differential operators is formulated estimates of speed of equiconvergence of decomposition are received in an integrated metrics both on any internal compact of an interval and on the whole interval the dependence of assessment of speed of equiconvergence of decomposition on any compact of the main interval from the distance of this compact to the interval border and also from some characteristics of the operator is established keywords ordinary differential operator eigenvalues spectral decomposition rate of convergence the formula of the average value 517 954 1 2 1 alexander losev volsu ru 2 lmazepa rambler ru 218 1 2 1 rn 70 rn 2 3 m lu u c x u g x 1 m c x 0 c x g x c 0 m 0 1 1 m u c 2 m lu g x c 2 c 2 l c m bk k 1
