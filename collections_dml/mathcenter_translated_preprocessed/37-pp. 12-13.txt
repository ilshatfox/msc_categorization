the study of the stress deformed state of three dimensional mke structures is considered a homogeneous isotropic concrete beam on the ribs of the beam are steel reinforcements along steel reinforcements stretching forces act the stresses and deformations of the concrete beam are sought in the general case the task boils down to the search for such a vector of displacements v in which a minimum of energy function l 1 2 v t d dv v q t v v v v v v v v v v dv s p t v dv where is the vector of deformations v vector of movements q vector of mass forces p vector of surface forces d the matrix of elastic constant for a numerical solution the initial structure is divided into an arbitrary number of finite elements as the final element a three dimensional final element of the isprametric type and the second degree of approximation was selected for a separate final element an expression of energy functionality is built as a function of moving nodes belonging only to this final element lm 1 2 qm t km qm pm t qm 13 where qm is the vector of nodal movements element km matrix of the stiffness of the element the energy functionality of the whole body is built as the sum of energy values for all elements it is believed that the movements of the nodes belonging to different elements are the same for all adjacent elements l and t r a t r a 1 golovanov a n berezhnaya d v the method of final elements in the mechanics of deformable solids kazan das 2001 302 p 2 golovanov a n zakirov r f paimushin v n piskunov a a shvetsov v a calculation of a stress deformed state of reinforced concrete structures tr mezh conf numerical and analytical methods for calculating structures samara 1998 s 67 71 t g g lenina chuvash state pedagogical university aleninatanya mail ru to the dual geometry of regular hyperpolos distribution in the space of affino metric coherence in the work of the indexes accept the following values j 0 n i j k l 1 n i j k s 1 m u v w m 1 n 1 m 1 n fourteen
