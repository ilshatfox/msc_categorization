the determination of relative phase diet for multi layer oil deposits is proposed to calculate the relative phase ponds of the premiums by water and oil it is believed that the deposit consists of several layers in the layers the permeability changes through the linear for stake liquids are filtered according to the scheme of jets 1 2 we determine the value of relative phase permeability the value of the average parameter of the kn for the entire pack kn i k h n is the number of p 1 asts in a pack the average knowledge from 11 1 phase permeability in water 1 q k 0 l k h kn 1 where to 0 l s with sn sv coherent oil and water it is easy to see that kj 1 kj p 2 1 thus we get 257 2 similarly we obtain the value of the relative phase through oil 2 where m 1 is the number of layers partially occupied by water and oil formulas 1 2 and 2 includes the value of k to determining the distribution of water saturation according to the layers we determine this veh 1 chica using the formula 1 and the position that the water is moving most 1 the distribution of vita water satisfies the equality not ik k h 3 e k jl k j 2 j where e 9 is the mobility of water e fluid mobility the values of water saturation s are calculated by the values of e s c e l c c the next formula serves to calculate the value of kj k during the saturation process k l d he e 4 n h n k where a l j d i j j j i kji k 2 k k 2 literature 1 bulygin v ya hydromechanics of the oil formation m not dra 1974 232 p 2 bulygin d v bulain v yya geology and imitation of the belt of the boot for theq jet of oil 1 nedra 1996 382 p o a vasi 1 yeva samara the task with integral and boundary conditions for the equation of a hyperbolic type with degeneration at one point of the boundary of the region in this work for equation 258
