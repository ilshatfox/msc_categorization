the remainder of the continuous tille fraction is empty the function f z is determined on the system in pairs 1 y nodes z 0 z 1 and determine the reverse differences for the function z g zo f zo g z 1 f z 1 reverse ra shosta zero 1 0 por dka 132 ikyu that ps considered by the reverse differences of 011 distant consider the interpolation continuity of the other those z zo j zo j j s z and the right fraction of the order z zo rp z f zo j zo zj z zn 1 is known that j zk rp zk k o 1 m tp p we also note that they sat down rn z n then the us the interpolation service you are filled with nds nodes zo z 1 zn theorem let the fuikv iya f z defined in pair of rains and they are nodes zo z 1 zn and in mo ch z and the right fraction of rp z interpols f z z in the indicated nodes then vypo l will clarify the cries f z rp z f z l 1 0 1 m pm zo z 1 zn z m 1 pt zo z 1 zn z n 1 zo z 1 zv 1 1 zv v o f zo z 1 z 1 z as an example consider the function j x x and polo in pairs of various nodes x 0 x 1 x then with a blade of theorem we get r x gho y l rnx 1 n 1 pm l m i vx x vx x
