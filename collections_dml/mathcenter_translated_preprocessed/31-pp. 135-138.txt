the differential geometry of the curves in the maple package a r samigullin tatar state humanitarian and pedagogical university alsu sam mail ru differential geometry of curves is the unification of analytical geometry and mathematical analysis and in particular affects the topics of differentiation of vectors vector operations integrating vectors ordinary differential differentials equation etc at the same time differential geometry is rich in various applications both geometric and mechanical and geometric optical packages of symbolic mathematics one of which is a maple package allow them to demonstrate these applications and give their graphic representations maple has well developed graphic capabilities which along with its analytical abilities and means of solving ordinary differential equations ode and their systems soda including methods of numerical solution allows you to solve these problems quite simply and effectively in this article we will describe the procedure for solving the main problems of the differential geometry of curves using the maple package 1 the graphic representation of the spatial curves spatial curves are built in maple using the spacecurve command r t a b libraries plots where r is the radius vector t is the parameter of the curve consider the construction of a spatial curve using the example of a screw line wound on a paraboloid rotation plots spacecurve t cos 8 pi t t sin 8 pi t t 2 t 0 1 color black thickness 3 numpoints 1000 2 construction and animation of the accompanying rapper of the curve the accompanying trihedral is determined by three derivatives of the radius vector r t of the arbitrary point of the curve with standard vector operations performed in the maple package using the linalg library commands derivatives of the n th order of the vector function r t x t y t z t are determined by the diff r t t n command scalar and vector works of vectors a and b is calculated in maple using the innerprod a b crossprod a b r t x t y t z t dr t dif r t t d 2 r t diff r t t 2 d 3 r t diff r t t 3 137 mod x simplify sqrt innerprod x x tau t scalarmul rt t 1 mod r t tau t beta t scalarmul crossprod dr t d 2 r t 1 mod crossprod r t d 2 r t nu t crossprod beta t tau t thus with a given curve three vectors of the accompanying trihedron are completely determined at each point of the curve the image of the accompanying trihedron can be obtained using the spacecurve command determining the parametric equations of straight lines with the reference point on the curve and guide vectors to animated the movement of the accompanying rapper you can use the display command with the insequence true parameter having previously created the sequence of the reereal graphs using the seq command 3 calculation of curvature and torsion of the curve create our own procedures for calculating curvature and torsion of curves mod x module of the vector x mod x simplify sqrt innerprod x x combprod x y z mixed works of three vectors combprod x y z simplify innerprod x crossprod y z k mod crossprod dr t d 2 r t mod dr t 3 kappa combprod dr t d 2 r t d 3 r t crossprod dr t d 2 r t 2 and we build a curvature schedule and twisting a screw line wound on a paraboloid rotation using the plot command plot k 1 kappa 1 t 0 2 pi 0 3 color red blue legend k 1 kappa 1 labels t k kappa 138
