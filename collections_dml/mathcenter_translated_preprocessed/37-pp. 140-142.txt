modeling in the task of multiple of the best choice with the minimum expected total rank is considered a generalization of the task of multiple of the best choice 1 in random order n objects ordered in quality are consistently it is required to find the optimal strategy that will minimize the mathematical expectation of absolute ranks e a 1 a 2 a k k 2 let a 1 a 2 an any rearrangement of numbers 1 2 n if the ai is the quality of the quality object among a 1 a 2 ai then we will write down yi b for all i 1 2 n yi a relative rank of an object we determine the price of the game v inf e a 1 a k 1 k the task of the best choice with the minimum total rank is to find the optimal strategy 1 k and winning values v let f m i algebra generated by the observations of relative ranks y 1 y 2 ymi if z m k e am 1 amk f m k 141 then v inf ez 1 k then the task comes down to the standard task of repeatedly stop the sequence z m k the solution to this problem will be the following optimal strategy there are sets of integers such that k k 1 k n k 1 0 6 k sixteen 6 k n k k n k 1 n 2 2 k 1 2 n 1 0 6 2 k 1 6 6 2 n 2 2 n 1 n 1 1 k 1 n 0 6 1 k 6 6 1 n 1 1 n n 1 i 1 j 6 i 2 j 1 6 i 1 i 2 6 k k i 1 1 6 j 6 n i 2 1 and 1 min m 1 ym 1 6 k m 1 i min mi mi 1 ymi 6 k i 1 mi on the set fi 1 1 m 1 i 1 mi 1 i 2 k f 0 see 1 following 2 to determine the sets 1 k consider the following maximization task it is required to find maxx edx e x r where x x x 1 x k conditions 1 are fulfilled r r 1 rn random rearrangement of numbers 1 2 n x non effective assessment x r x 1 n 1 n 1 n 1 rn 1 rn k 142 to solve the problem of combinatorial optimization the method of consistent minimization of the distance of kulbak label cross entropy method is used 3 in this work the values of the game v and sets of stopping sets were obtained l and t r a t r a 1 nikolaevm l optimal rules of multiple stop cross graff and industry mat 1998 t 5 issue 2 c 309 348 2 sofronov yu kruze d kif j nikolaev m l about one method of modeling thresholds in the task of multiple of the best choice cross graff and industry mathemat 2006 t 13 issue 6 s 975 983 3 rubinsteinr kroesed the cross entropy method a unified approach to combinatorial optimization monte carlo simulation and machine learning n y springer werlag 2004 318 p 143
