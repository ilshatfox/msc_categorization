some functionals on the space of configurations associated with the specifications of random fields b s nahapetyan l a khachatryan we show that the problem of description of random fields in terms of a subsystem of a specification consisting only of one point probability distributions the dobrushin problem reduces to the problem of extension of functionals defined on pairs of configurations that differ only in one point to the whole space of pairs of configurations such contination is possible under certain symmetry conditions of the functional keywords specification random field udc 514 822 properties of the spherical module of the family of crooked a novik 1 a n malyutin 2 1 novik anastasiia mail ru tomsk state university faculty of mechanics and mathematics 2 nmd math tsu ru tomsk state university faculty of mechanics and mathematics is devoted to studying the properties and calculating the spherical module of the krivn family as well as its distortion during display from the s medium characteristic 1 keywords spatial module spatial display module of the curve family the presence of extreme metrics and modules of the families of curves even on a plane is often related to difficulties because leading to the solution of the system of differential equations in private derivatives therefore to find extreme metric there is no universal method until now few spatial tasks are known for which the modules have been found a significant contribution to the development of the theory of modules was made by v a zorich i p mityuk v m milikov g d suvorov a v sychev b fyug lane j jenkins f goering yu g signac o martio s rickman ju v is l et al definition 1 let some family of curves in r n borelevsky function r rn 0 let s call the permissible metric of the family if pdlx 1 for each curve where dlx dl 1 x 2 in the future the recording p will mean that p is the permissible metric of the family determination 2 the spherical module of the family is determined by the formula m inf rn p d x where d x d x 1 2 n and inf is taken over the class of all kinds of metrics p note that the n dimensional integral in the definition of the module can be narrowed to the smallest borelevsky set of e containing the family since inf in 276 materials of the international school conference of this definition is achieved on metrics in zolo on c e obviously 0 m ear if the metrics class p is empty then we believe m inous determination 3 family is exclusive if m 0 we will say that some property occurs for almost all the crooked family if the subfamily in which it does not take place is exceptional theorem 1 the family of all kinds of indestructible curves in r n is exclusively proof let the icle be a family of all highly indestructible curves in r n enter the function p 0 x 1 x ln x x 2 1 x 2 1 for it rn pn 0 dlx 2 n n n 1 n 1 lnn 1 2 mm rn pn 0 d x 2 n n n 1 n 1 lnn 1 2 and in addition p 0 dlx 0 for each curve in fact if the curve is limited then p 0 x a 0 on and the statement is obvious if is unlimited then choosing a point x on the x 2 we have p 0 dlx x dr r lnr inous thus the p 0 function is permissible metric and therefore the icle family is exceptional the theorem has been proven theorem 2 family of all kinds of curves passing through the arbitrary point p of the r n space is exclusively let f r n r n transformation of the mebius i e display represented in the form of a superposition of the final number of the following known elementary transformations 1 parallel transfer f x x a a rn 2 homotetes f x r x r 0 3 orthogonal transformation f x type f x linear transformation and f x x for all x rn 4 inversions regarding the sphere s n 1 a r f x a r 2 x a x a 2 determination 4 if for a certain p 0 metrics there is rn p 0 d x then the metric p 0 is called extreme we indicate the basic properties of modules 1 if 1 2 then m 1 m 2 2 m icle 1 i 1 m i the property of semi adaditivity theorem 3 extreme metric of the family is determined in the only way with accuracy to the values of the multiple of the n mortal swing measure zero proof let the p 01 and p 02 two extreme metrics of the family enter the function p p 01 p 022 we prove that p is an acceptable measure for each curve we have p 01 dlx 1 and p 02 dlx 1 then pdlx 12 p 01 dlx 12 p 02 dlx 1 a novik a n malyutina 277 on the other hand since the function a t bt 2 1 t a 0 b 0 is an increasing function from t t 0 the inequality p 01 p 022 p 01 p 02 2 is performed and the equal sign takes place in those and only those points x in which p 01 x p 02 x it follows that rn p d x rn p 01 p 02 2 d x 12
