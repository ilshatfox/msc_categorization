slumping superpropagation rotation fingering and upconing in two phase abrupt interface flows sharp interfaces between fluids of different density and viscosity are common in models of sea water intrusion remediation of soils contaminated by dense liquids genesis and prospecting of oil gas traps in hydrocarbon deposits among others e g 1 in terms of the charny hydraulic model we examine the known and obtain new solutions to problems of dynamics of abrupt interfaces in porous layers the general charny pde of nonlinear diffusion is reduced to a nonlinear ode in cases of a stable finger a travelingwave finger and a rotating straight interface with explicit rigorous solutions to these equations a peculiarity of the solutions is the degeneration of the governing equation appearance of free surfaces the finger possesses one degeneration point and extends infinitely upstream where flow of the moving phase is uniform we analyze also superpropagation of an interface with two degeneration points in 243 case of periodic injection at a sinusoidal time variation of the incident seepage rate the interface is analytically shown to advance deeper than it would at a constant rate drive similar superpropagation is illustrated by the runge kutta integration of the green ampt nonlinear ode describing vertical infiltration from a ponded surface into a dry soil we juxtapose our solutions with the philip superelevation phenomenon in coastal aquifers the boussinesq equation 2 we quantify counter slumping i e propagation of one of the edges against the incident flow direction when the interface is sufficiently steep 3 in terms of a full hydrodynamic model we apply the methods of complex analysis conformal mappings of circular polygons in the hodograph plane onto the complex potential domain the signorini formula and its generalizations in the dirichlet and mixed boundaryvalue problems to study steady 2 d interfaces for a gas water interface in a monocline dipping at an arbitrary angle two regimes contraction and expansion are possible and explicit analytical solutions are derived in terms of hypergeometric functions for a gas oil trap the interface consists of two branches along which the isobaric condition and the condition of a linear increase of pressure with depth are reduced to a standard hodograph representation through two touching circles for flow to a sink in a soil layer which bottom is an impermeable horizontal rock humped by an impermeable but flexible lens containing a heavier immobile liquid a boundary value problem is solved in the class of functions with singularities at the transition points in a vortex generated flow 1 we prove that the interface is an optimal shape the necessary and sufficient conditions of a unique global extremum are satisfied and both the criterion and the extremal the taylor saffman bubble are presented in an explicit form this study was supported by sultan qaboos university projects agswat 9903 and agr 99 13 and by the rfbr grants no 9901 00364 no 99 01 00173 no 01 01 0888 and through the grant no 09 12 2000 f of the tatarstan academy of sciences r e f e r e n c e s 1 strack o d l groundwater mechanics prentice hall 244 englewood cliffs 1989 2 philip j r periodic nonlinear diffusion an integral relation and its physical consequences 1973 australian j phys v 26 p 513 519 3 huppert h e and woods a w gravity driven flows in porous layers 1995 j fluid mech v 292 p 55 69 i v konopleva b v loginov ul yanovsk invariant reduction of branching equations in real banach spaces e 1 e 2 the following bifurcation point problem is considered b x r x r 0 0 0 r 0 0 1 here b d b e 1 e 2 is a closed linear fredholm operator with dense in e 1 domain d b n b span 1 n n b span 1 n j n 1 e 1 and zj n 1 e 2 are corresponding biorthogonal systems the terminology and notation from 1 3 are used it is supposed that 1 admits a l parametrical continuos group g a a a 1 al d rl and a discrete group g 1 i e it is invariant with respect to g a g 1 g the subspace e n 1 is invariant with respect to l a condition i in coordinate representations in en 1 n b and n b the matrices representations ag and bg arise and the branching equation beq corresponding to 1 is invariant with respect to ag and bg t ag bgt the beq is called potential if the equality f d grad u holds with a nonsingular matrix d theorem 1 the potential u of the g invariant beq is an invariant of ag if a gdbg d in fact for ag we have du u d u d d 1 t d condition ii let l a be a l parametric continuous group e 1 acting l 1 optimally in n b it means that there exists a basis i n 1 245
