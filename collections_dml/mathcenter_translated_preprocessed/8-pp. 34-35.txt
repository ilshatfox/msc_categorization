the ratios of the spaces of infinitely differentiated periodic functions examine the spaces of infinitely differentiated periodic period 2 for all variable n 1 functions with the final metric winger a p u x cinger t n u 0 a d u x pp urb 1 here a 0 is a numerical sequence 1 n integer multi core 1 p mm tn n dimee it p is the norm in the space of the lp tn lebag space 1 is called non trivial if it is endlessly and tightly in l 2 tn for this as shown by yu a dubinsky 1 it is necessary and enough for lim mit a 1 0 2 for space 1 and similarly to the determined space winger b p t n condition 2 is supposed to be completed two methods of constructing a regularized n dimensional matrix a 1 0 for all are proposed that the spaces are wyunt a p t n and winger a 1 p t n coincide i e mutual investments take place the first method is based on the assessment of the norms of mixed derivatives through the norms of derivatives for one variable in lp tn the second on the representation of each element a by the amount of n j 1 b j and further regulatory of one dimensional sequences from the components and lines separately the method proposed by the author in 2 35
