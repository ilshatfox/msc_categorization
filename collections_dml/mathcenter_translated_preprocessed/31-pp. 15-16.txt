orifunctional compacting of the linear space with the strictly convex norm p d andreev pomeranian state university named after m v lomonosov the city of arkhangelsk for the orifunctional compacting of the xh metric space x m riffel 1 determined the concept of the buzeman point in the case of the space of incompatible curvature along the bozeman not every orifunction on x sets the point of buzeman and not every point of the buzeman is set by the function of the ceman c determined by some geodesic beam c r x equality of c x lim t x c t t in addition to orifunctional it is important for the self called geodetic compacting xg x gx spaces of incompatible curvature according to buzeman it occurs if the classes of asymptotic rays are considered as infinitely removed points a conical topology is introduced on xg see 2 in the case when space x is 15 cat 0 a spaceship compacting xg coincides with the orifunctional compacting in addition to cat 0 spaces to the main classes of the spaces of incompatible curvature according to buzeman normalized linear spaces should be attributed subject to strict convexity of the norm theorem let v n n dimensional linear space with a strictly convex norm then the following conditions i am equivalent 1 any orifunction is the point of buzeman 2 the family of the extreme sets of a single ball b tweeted space v n is closed in the topology of punovo kuratovsky 3 the compacting v n h and v n g is topologically equivalent with n 3 there are examples when the conditions given in the theorem are not fulfilled the work was supported by the russian federation project 04 01 00315 and the program development of the scientific potential of higher education project 335 l and t r a t rieffel m group c algebras as compact quantum metric spaces doc math 2002 no 7 p 605 651 2 hotchkiss ph the boundary of busemann space proc amer math soc 1997 v 125 no 7 p 1903 1912 stratification and groups of autorphisms of orbimes of affinity 16
