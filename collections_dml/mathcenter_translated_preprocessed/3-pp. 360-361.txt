a numerical method for solving the filtering problem with the maximum gradient in the variation production of o a shirokov nimm of the kazakh state university olga shirokova ksi ru presented a numerical solution to the problem of filtering with the maximum gradient in variation the task is considered to be supplanted by water of viscous and plastic oil in a circular layer through the discentric non centrices of the well g g boundaries of constant pressure entrance and you are the course of the filtration flow g p n g p o where the given pressure for the current function f on impermeable faces 360 tsakh g 1 g 2 of the region the conditions are met where q is filtrated it is known 1 that the true field of speeds minimizes the function of the function j f l g i l ljj i dxdy hq where the function g is determined by the law of filtering filtering with the maximum gradient where t is the size of the maximum gradient k is filtration resistance the presence of a maximum pressure gradient is driven to the fact that region n is divided into areas of two types filtration zone and stagnant the mobile border of these zones is not known in advance and is determined in the course of solving the problem a direct number of filtration currents based on minimizing non differentiated functionality allows you to find a true field of speeds and determine the position of a free border to walk the minimum functionality relaxation algorithms for minimizing non differential functions are used and the proposals in the work 2 literature 1 kosterin a v the use of the methods of stubborn anadis to the suspension of non amaling filtration in the current tube sat exercise on underground hydromechanics kazan publishing house kazan university 1984 vm 7 s 70 78 2 kreinin m i edification adhorims of minimization of undifferentiated functions abstract cand dissertation kazan 1981 361
