the presentation of the elements of the algebra von neumann in the form of the final sums of the works of the projectors let the hilbert space above the field c through b h denoting algebra of all linear limited operators in h operator x b h is called the projector if x x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x the following tasks are solved in the work i to present each element of the algebra von neumann m which does not have the direct ablev of the term in the form of the final sum of the final works of projectors from m ii indicate the smallest upper boundary for the number of complicates in the terms of such ideas earlier other authors considered only performances in a weaker form the coefficients from c or r in the terms were allowed the task ii was not studied in 1 a brief overview of the existing works in this direction was given and a complete solution to problems i ii for the case m b h was obtained each linear limited operator x in the guilertial space h is presented in the form of the final amount x xk where each xk has a work of no more than two projects at dim h inous and no more than three projectors at 2 dim h inous the next statement is unreasonable in terms of the number of residents theorem if algebra von neumann m does not have a direct abelev component respectively actually infinite then each operator x m is presented as a final amount x xk where each xk is a work of no more than three respectively two projectors from m from our result a new evidence of the equivalence of the primary classification of the algebrus von neumann in terms of projectors and in traces of traces description of the yordan structure of the hermite part of the algebra von mana algebra of observed quantum mechanics in terms of projectors i e questions of quantum mechanics we also give several auxiliary statements presenting 31 independent interest lemma 1 each hydropotent q toiletal c algebra a is presented in the form of a product q py where p apr and the operator y a and turn lemma 2 let the algebra von neumanm not have direct component of the final type i then a each operator x msa with x 2 2 is presented in the form of the amount of 24 symmetries from m b each operator z msa c z 11 13 is presented in the form of the amount of 24 projectors from m c each reversible operator y m is presented as a linear combination of projectors from m with positive coefficients lemma 3 let n algebra von neumann and 2 n n each operator x mn n is represented as a final sum of pair of thes of the idempotents mn n and in each complicated one of the dubbaters left or right is possible choose a projector for algebra b h the approval of lemm 1 and 2 were obtained in 4 and 3 corresponded note that in 2 the problem i is solved for the wide class c algebr the work was supported by the program universities of russia fundamental research code of the project ur 04 01 011 l and t r a t r a 1 bikchentaev a m on the representation of linear operators in guil berty space in the form of the final sums of works of projectors dokl an russia 2003 t 393 no 4 s 444 447 2 bikchentaev a m sherstnev a n projector conapal combinations in c albrahs with the property of unitary factorization matem notes 2004 accepted for printing 3 fillmore p a on sums of projections j funct anal 1969 v 4 no 1 p 146 152 4 fujii j i furuta t holub s factorization and normal approximations of idempotent operators math japon 1980 v 25 no 1 p 143 45 32
