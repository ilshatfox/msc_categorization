the approximation of non trivial trajectories of the global attorrator 1 a kornev moscow state university named after m v lomonosov moscow considers the task of the quality behavior of the trajectories of a given semi dynamic system at large times we are interested in what points of space h can see the observer after a rather long formally endless period of time the initial conditions are taken from a certain ball ba h the answer to this question for end ry spaces h is given theory of predecessive sets its generalization in case locally non membranous space h is commonly called the theory of a global attorrator the main facts of the general theory and the method of approximation of non trivial trajectories of the global attorney with guaranteed accuracy are given the 1 st work was carried out with the financial support of the rffif the project no 05 0565045 and the nwo grant 047 016 008 19 approximation of non trivial trajectories 1 global attorney mathematical definition of a global attorrator as an object that correctly characterizes the dynamics of the system in large times depends significantly on the class of the processes under study at the moment there are several widely used definitions the following tasks are considered to be investigated in terms of the minimum global b andttractor usually called global rener proposed in the work of o a ladyzhenskaya 12 for two dimensional equations of navier stox let h banakh space with the norm t non trivial subgroup of the additive group of material numbers r t t 0 ger half group of non negative elements from t and s t h h continuous in the second argument the display with a half group property s t 1 s t 2 u s t 1 t 2 u t 1 t 2 t u h troika s t h is called 14 polodynamic system pds at the same time h is the space of the system the role of time is played by t and the evolution of the system is set by the operator s if t r then we are talking about a semi odynamic system with continuous time in the work discrete pdss are considered almost everywhere time is set by the half group t i 0 1 the transition from the operator of the task s t u with continuous time is formally carried out by the following replacement si u s i u with some not necessarily small 0 in this case the term semi dynamic system means that the dynamics of si is determined at i 0 note that if for some subspace h h there is also si u for all u h and i 0 then on h the initial semi dynamic system can be expanded to the dynamic system we introduce the necessary concepts and formulate the following the known results of the general theory of the attractions 3 12 14 16 20 in terms of semi dynamic systems with continuous or discrete time s t h further for the convenience of presentation we assume that the record is ut s t u is also allowed for the case of continuous time i e for t r 20 a a the kornev is called the following sets for point u u ut s t u t 0 t u ut s t u t t similarly the positive half sector and its part are determined for an arbitrary limited subservience b h b u t b u b t u point is called a predicting point for point u or the same for the semi sectors u t u if there is such an increasing sequence of values tn 0 6 t 1 t 2 tn lim n tn inous that lim n ger stn u many all kinds of predicted points for u is called predatory set and then u is indicated similarly the predictive set b for an arbitrary limited subset b note that the set of b consists of the limiting points of all kinds of converging sequences of the type lim n stn u where u b tn there is 16 lemma 1 1 the set of u of all predatory points for u h is invariant and closed recall that the set of m x is called invariant more precisely strictly invariant in relation to the pds if st m m for arbitrary t 0 note that an arbitrary invariant set consists of complete trajectories the opposite is true at the same time there is an invariant set of an invariant set the next lemma 16 gives an equivalent description of predatory sets lemma 1 2 u t 0 t u h b t 0 t b h 21 approximation of non trivial trajectories here the symbol h means the closure in the metric of space h note that since t 2 b t 1 b for t 2 t 1 in the condition of lemma the intersection for all t 0 can be replaced by the intersection according to t t with an arbitrary t 0 for a wide class of mathematical modeling tasks a qualitative description properties approximation of the predatory set ba t 0 t ba h for some sufficiently large enough the ball of the initial conditions
