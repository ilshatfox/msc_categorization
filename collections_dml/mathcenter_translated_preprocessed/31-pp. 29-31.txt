the influence of point features in the flow on the aerodynamic characteristics of the streamlined plate of e v varsgov nimmm kazan state university in the tasks of aerohydrodynamics cause certain interests of the flow of wing profiles in the presence of features of the type of source vortex vortex sore vortex such tasks were studied at one time by s a chaplygin v v golubev the task of the flow of a circle with a whirlwind was solved by a i nekrasov 1 7 8 and m t nugin 2 16 the reverse task of finding 29 of the form of the profile according to the distribution of speeds given on it in the presence of a vortex is studied by m t nuzhin 2 16 and using the quasi of quasi n b ilyinsky and a v potashev 3 this work is devoted to solving the problem of the flow of an impenetrable plate with a well established stream of ideal inconspicuous fluid in the presence of a vortex in the flow of a vortex the method of comparing the planes was applied to solving this problem as a result of the solution the complex potential of the current was built the current lines were found the distribution of speed on the surface of the plate was obtained and the dynamic effect of the flow on the plate located in it was calculated the results of numerical calculations are given on their basis an analysis was made on the influence of the position intensity and circulation of the vortex on the aerodynamic characteristics of the plate it was established that the approximation of the vortex to the plate and an increase in circulation leads to an increase in the lifting force and a decrease in the resistance force and an increase in intensity leads to an increase in resistance and lifting force private cases were also considered source stock and whirlwind i express my gratitude to the scientific leader professor n b ilyinsky for setting the task and useful tips the work was supported by the rfff project 05 08 01153 and fcntp the ri 112 001 465 project l and t r a t r a 1 nekrasov a i collected works m publishing house of the ussr academy of sciences 1962 706 p 2 tumashev g g nuzhin m t reverse regional tasks and their applications kazan publishing house kazan university 1965 333 p 30 3 ilyinsky n b potashev a v construction of a wing profile with a closing modeled by a point vortex izv ras mechanics of liquid and gas 1992 no 1 p 3 9 fundamental solutions for the tasks of bending isotropic and orthotropic round plates of p g velikanov kazan state university my www ksu ru when solving problems by the method of boundary elements it is necessary to primarily determine the fundamental solution which is a solution to a differential equation on the right side of which delta function of dirac is contained there are several methods to determine the fundamental solution of the corresponding problem the use of integral transformation of fourier for differential equations with constant coefficients the use of the transformation of the kummer lyuville to bring a differential equation with variable coefficients to the equation with constant coefficients with the subsequent use of the integral transformation of fourier in this work it is proposed to find a fundamental solution based on the found general solution of a homogeneous equation if a general solution of a homogeneous differential equation is found it turns out that the fundamental solution is a product of the sign of a sign on a general solution to a homogeneous differential equation with the coefficients found when solving the system of linear algebraic equations this system is always resolved because vronskian is different from zero differential equations with p 31
