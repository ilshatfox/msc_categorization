locally free action of endless groups let g a group acting on an additively recorded abel group v they say that g acts freely on v if vg 6 v for 0 6 v v 1 6 g g the known tsassenhaus theorem gives the classification of the final groups that can act freely on the non trivial abele group in 1 this theorem was distributed from the final groups to groups in which any two conjugated elements of a simple order generate the final subgroup significant progress was achieved in 2 where it is proved that the periodic group generated by elements of about three and acting freely on the non trivial abel group is finite the work 3 shows that the condition for frequency in this result can be loosened to the condition of the limb of the order of the switch of any two conjugated elements of the order 3 finally in 4 the result of 2 mentioned above is generalized when the condition of freedom of action is applied only on subgroups generated by two conjugated elements of a simple order the next result significantly expands the class of the studied groups due to the weakening of the condition imposed on 2 sorrower subgroups teorema 1 let g a group acting exactly on the abel group v suppose g is generated by such a class x of the conjugated elements of about 3 that any two elements x y from x are either double halved or generate a periodic subgroup acting freely on v then g is either a cyclic group of about 56 ka 3 or an extension of a group of about 2 by means of a skillful group a i substitutions of some not necessarily final set of i power no less than 4 as follows from 3 the condition for the frequency of the subgroup x y in theorem 1 can be replaced with the condition of the limb of the order of the switch x y the approval the reverse theorem 1 is also true the work was supported by the russian fund for fundamental research projects no 02 01 00495 no 02 01 39005 grant n ur 04 01 028 programs of the universities of russia as well as the council for grants of the president of the russian federation and state support of leading scientific schools project no nsh 2069 2003 1 l and t r a t raltouts a i on the structure of a non invariant multiplier in some groups of frobenius sib mat journal 1994 t 35 no 4 s 893 901 2 zhurbov a kh on the quadratic automorphisms of the abel groups algebra and logic 2000 t 39 p 320 328 3 mazurov v d churkin v a on the free action of the group on the abel group sib mat journal 2002 t 43 no 3 p 600 608 4 zhurbov a kh on a group acting locally free on the abel group sib mat journal 2003 t 44 s 343 346 t m mitrofanova kazan my www ksu ru to build the kartanovsky continuation of the algebra lee type b 3 let l 1 i 3 li the non alpotenic part of the classic algebra of the type b 3 with a graduation in height of the roots the ultimate goal of this work is to build a complete kartanovsky continuation of the algebra l above the field k characteristics p 2 3 using a crawling display see 1 with other characteristics the continuation breaks off with algebra type b 3 in these theses we indicate only the display 0 and 1 57
