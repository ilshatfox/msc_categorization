one mixed task of the theory of elasticity for a piece a native body with a straightforward section considers the task of a flat theory of elasticity about the hard linear inclusion located on the straight line of the section of two environments one of the aspects of the inclusion is rigidly connected to the medium and the other is in a state of sliding contact mathematically the task is to build in the plane of the complex alternating z two pieces of piece headerfic functions z z with a line of break on the segment l coinciding with the inclusion according to the regional conditions im t t q t 203 im 1 t t r t 1 2 s 1 t s 2 t s 3 t s 4 t p t t l in the class of functions h 0 having a given behavior on urb here j sj given actual permanent p q r set functions task 1 is reduced to the construction of one function z according to the edge conditions im t g 1 t 2 re t t g 2 t t l where the actual constant and the functions of gj t are expressed through the initial data of the tasks the solution to the problem 2 is clearly in quadrature by introducing two new auxiliary functions by symmetry task 2 is a particular case of a more general task re a 1 t b 1 t g 1 t re a 2 t b 2 art t g 2 t t l aj bj complex constant to which many tasks of the theory of elasticity are reduced in particular the task of interference cracks one of the coasts of which is in contact with a smooth stamp or strengthened by a flexible unstable thread the work was supported by the russian federation project 01 01 00720 v v silvestrov a k yardukhin cheboksary the use of the combined regional problem of riman gilbert to solve one mixed problem of elastic theory is considered a plane composed of two different elastic properties of isotropic half fruits cracks aj bj and completely exfoliated thin hard angle inclusions ck dk the shores of 204 are located on the line of their connection
