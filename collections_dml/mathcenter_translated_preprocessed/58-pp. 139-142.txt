numerical modeling of laser radiation with a round micro zone with an non center active zone a o oktyabrskaya 1 1 alina oktyabrskaya 21 gmail com kazan volga federal university the institute of computing mathematics and information technologies proposes methodological modeling of laser radiation with active micro zone with holes the corresponding nonlinear spectral task for the system of boundary integral equations is solved by the galerkin method with a trigonometric basis the results of numerical experiments are given and the method of the effectiveness of the method keywords galerkin method spectral task for the system of boundary integral equations laser radiation lasers based on micro rusonators are widely used in a photonic one of the approaches to the study of their characteristics is based on solving the so called laser problem to its own values 1 in 1 the problem was solved numerically by the method of quadrators if the shape of the resonators and holes is round then the galerkin method may be preferable since in this case the matrix elements are written in explicitly 2 in this work we develop ideas formulated in 2 and give the results of numerical experiments confirming the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm consider a round resonator with an non center round hole fig 1 its shape consists of two regions of pipi and 2 these areas are limited by non center circles 1 and 2 with radii a 1 and a 2 respectively we denote the external region we introduce local coordinate systems for areas 1 and 2 as shown in the figure rice 1 the geometry of a round resonator let the function u describes the amplitude of the resonator s own fashion see 1 we will look for such numbers k 0 and 0 in which the non earlier function u 140 lobachevsky readings 2019 is a solution to the helmholtz equation u k 2 mu 0 x m m 1 2 3 1 satisfies the conjugation conditions u u m u rm m 1 u rm x m m 1 2 2 as well as the condition of radmerfeld radiation at infinity b 1 2 km k m m 1 2 3 for h polyarization u hz m 2 m for polarization u ez and m 1 symbol rm b 2 we denote a single normal to the border m directed outside the region m we will search for solutions to the problem 1 2 in the class of integrated functions that are continuously differentiated in closed areas m and twice continuously differentiated in m m 1 2 3 we use the integral representations of the function u u x 1 u y g 1 x y r 1 y dl y 1 g 1 x y u y r 1 y dl y x 1 3 u x 1 u y g 2 x y r 1 y dl y 1 g 2 x y u y r 1 y y y y y r 1 y dl y 2 u y g 2 x y r 2 y dl y 2 g 2 x y u y r 2 y dl y x 2 4 u x 2 u y g 3 x y r 2 y dl y 2 g 3 x y u y r 2 y dl y x 3 5 here gm x y i 4 h 1 0 km x y the foundational solution of the gelm golts equation following 1 2 we will reduce the initial task 1 2 to the nonlinear task for our own values for the system of boundary integral equations of muller for example the second equation of the system has the following type 2 u 1 x 1 u 1 y k 1 1 x y v 1 y k 1 2 x y dl y 2 u 2 y k 1 3 x y v 2 y k 1 4 x y dl y 0 where x 1 own functions have the form um x u x u x vm m 1 m 2 m u x rm x m 1 m 2 op 1 u x rm x xm m a o oktyabrskaya 141 where m 1 2 the nuclei in the system of integral equations of the muller have the form k 1 1 x y g 1 x y g 2 x y r 1 y k 1 2 x y 2 1 g 2 x y 2 2 g 1 x y 2 1 k 1 3 x y g 2 x y r 2 y k 1 4 x y 2 3 g 2 x y 3 2 we solve the system of integrated equations in numerically using the galerkin method with a trigonometric basis present our own functions in the form u n m t 1 am n k n onic m k ei kt v n m t 1 am n k n m k ei kt m 1 2 t 0 2 following 2 3 we calculate the matrix elements analytical elements then the non linear algebraic task for its own values will take the following type a 11 a 12 a 13 a 14 a 22 a 23 a 24 a 32 a 33 a 33 a 34 a 42 a 43 w 2 2 1 2 0 here ai j is a block matrix with elements a i j k l i j 1 4 k l n n which are non linearly dependent on their own numbers k and own vector has the form onic i pul i n onic i n i i n i n matrices a 11 a 12 a 21 a 22 a 33 a 34 a 43 a 44 diagonal elements of the matrix ai j write in explicitly a 1 1 l l 1 a 1 i i 2 k 1 jl k 1 a 1 h 1 l k 1 a 1 i let 2 k 2 jl k 2 a 1 h 1 l k 2 a 1 a 1 2 l l i 1 2 1 jl k 2 a 1 h 1 l k 2 a 1 i 2 2 1 jl k 1 a 1 h 1 l k 1 a 1 a 1 3 k l i 2 k 2 h 1 k k 2 a 2 jk l k 2 d jl k 2 a 1 ei k l 1 2 a 1 4 k l i 3 3 2 h 1 k k 2 a 2 jk l k 2 d jl k 2 a 1 ei k l 1 2
