the algorithm for constructing a multi party which determines the area of convergence of the integral of mellin barns representing the solution of the pentanomy algebraic equation we consider the nstanomial algebraic equation 75 from the result of melli 1 sh 1 it is known that the degree o the branch of the solution y x y o 1 seems to be the integral of mellin barns of the type 2 1 de integration is carried out according to imaginary vertical under space 1 ijr 3 the vector from the fixed and selected from the simplex to the rabpgs 2 j yu dokuano that nri is the condition of 2 n 2 ints l jji 2 converges above the inside of the day trial worker see fig 1 it can degenerate into a tenth game and parallels of the nri nri corresponding conditions for ryu t 3 atsli monomas and equation 1 76 t v zizovl in this work based on this result with the buildings of the computer algebra algorithm in the maple environment during the execution of the program a duodengine nickname is built a ten sided parallelepiped which determines the finish of the integral 2 representing the solution of the pentanomy algebraic equation 1 the ma program consists of several procedures the main domain for procedure pentanomial algebraic eqis is implemented according to the structure of the polyhedron the input data of the procedure is the indicators of the monomas of the pentanomy algebraic equation in fig 1 presents one of the results of the program a fig 1 the duodenum p 2 n 2 literature 1 mellin n resolution de l equation algebtique generale a l iide de la fonuction gamma c r acad sci paiis ser 1921 v 172 r 658 661 2 zykova t v on the similarity of the venue of the integral me r 1 11 ina barns on the border of its area of convergence bulletin of kemsu 2011 t 47 no 3 1 p 199 202
