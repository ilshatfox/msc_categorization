the canonical almost geodetic transformations of the second type of almost hermite varieties with a familiar metric space of an affinity is called smooth diversity in the main stratification of the reaches of which the connectivity is fixed 1 consider two spaces of affinity without twisting an and an diffherorphism an on an almost geodetic reflection 2 if as a result of this reflection each geodetic line of space an passes into almost geodetic spaces of an almost geodetic displays of the second type of affinity spaces 2 an an are geometrically characterized by the fact that each geodetic line as with the field of the tangent vector h passes into almost geodetic an for which the field of two dimensional planes e 2 at each point is a linear membrane of the h and jh vectors and jh x let m 2 n almost hermitovo diversity with a almost hermite structure j g set on it where j is an almost comprehensive structure on m consider the almost geodesical transformation of the second type to m which retains structural endomorphism j denote g g the structure j g is also an almost ermit structure on m the almost geodetic display of the second type is called canonical 2 if the affinite deformation tensor from rome 48 of the new connectedness metric g to riman coherence where is a certain co chamber then the covariant derivative of structural endomorphism j relative to coherence has the form x j y x j y jy jx y x we denote through c b respectively the structural and virtual tensors of the ah structure j g and through c b are structural and virtual tensors of the ah structure j g theorem 1 the structural tensor does not change during the canonical almost geodetic transformations of the second type and the virtual changes according to the following law b x y b x y y jx jy x if g and g are two pseudoriman structures on m then due to the symmetry of the tensor g there is self combined endomorphism f such that g x y g x fy let g rimanova structure then the tp m allows the basis consisting of its own vectors of endomorphism f that is from vectors y such as fy y r using the properties of a virtual tensor we get y g jx y jy g x y 0 due to the uninterruption of the metric g y jx jy x 0 49 from the linear independence of vectors x and jx it follows that y 0 since f admits a basis consisting of its own vectors of this endomorphism then 0 thus we get the following result theorem 2 almost hermitovo diversity with familiar metric does not allow non trivial canonical almost geodetic transformations of the second type l and t r a t r a 1 kirichenkov f differential geometric structures on the varieties m mpgu 2003 495 p 2 sinyukovn s geodetic display of riman spaces m nauka 1979 255 p v i zhegalov o a tikhonov kazan state university oatihonova rambler ru cascading integration in three dimensional space the result described below is considered as a continuation of their research from 1 3 dedicated to the study of the possibilities of solving in quadrators equations with senior private derivatives this message proposes a method for spreading the method of cascading integration of laplace 4 3 2 from the case of two independent variables to the spatial equation of the bianchi ik 0 1 k 1 3 a i 1 i 2 i x i 1 i 2 i 3 x 1 i 1 x 2 i 2 x 3 i 3 u x f 1 50
