asymptotic expansion of the model solution for the supercritical fluid extraction in polydisperse packed beds a a salamatin asymptotic expansion of the model solution for the supercritical fluid extraction in polydisperse packed beds of ground plant material is derived the first three terms of the expansion are obtained they describe the simulation of extraction process with high accuracy fractional composition of polydisperse particles is described by three the parameters volume fraction of small particles specific surface area and polydispersity parameter of main particle fraction of relatively large characteristic size keywords supercritical fluid extraction shrinking core model asymptotic expansion distribution function polydispersity 51 1 2 1 belosnegka 97 mail ru 2 chernaya nastya icloud com 4 131 60 70 1970 130 1953 1966 1970 40 150 1967 1965
