alternativity and disjunctivity in c algebras definition 1 an orthmodular poset omp e is called alternative 1 if every orthogonal subset of e either has a supremum or has no minimal majorants definition 2 an orthmodular poset omp e is called disjunctive 3 if for any pair a b in e such that a 6 b there is c a such that c b 0 in the paper 2 the notions of alternativity as well as disjunctivity 3 of omps were studied in the context of orthoprojections or idempotents in c algebras namely there was proved in 2 that the omp of all idempotents in a von neumann algebra is disjunctive but in the same time the orthomodular poset of all idempotents on a hilbert space is not alternative we recall that the idempotents are elements p of a c algebra such that p 2 p the idempotents with the property p p are projections the sets of all idempotents or all projections are omp s with the order p q iff pq qp p and the involution p e p the following theorem was announced in 5 and is a generalization of 2 theorem 1 the omp of all idempotents in a von neumann algebra m acting in a separable complex hilbert space is alternative if and only if m is of finite type the proof uses some constructions of 2 and 4 as well as the existence of a center valued trace in finite von neumann algebras the following theorem generalizes a result of 2 theorem 2 the omp of all idempotents in a c algebra m is disjunctive if and only if the omp of all projections in m is disjunctive r e f e r e n c e s 1 ovchinnikov p g on alternative orthomodular posets demonstra tio mathematica 1994 v 27 p 89 93 2 grigoryan s a mushtari d h ovchinnikov p g disjunctivity and alternativity in projection logics int j of theoretical physics 2000 v 19 p 705 709 3 godowski r disjunctivity and orthodisjunctivity in orthomodular 113 posets demonstratio mathematica 1979 v 12 p 1043 1049 4 mushtari d h projection logics in banach spaces izvestiya vysshikh uchebnykh zavedenii seriya matematika 1989 no 8 p 59 70 russian 5 mushtari d h alternativity in von neumann algebras wien quantum structures 2002 http tph tuwien ac at qs 114
