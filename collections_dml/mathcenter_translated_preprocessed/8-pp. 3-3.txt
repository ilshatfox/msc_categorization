the linear continuous operator of continuation in the aorem whitney let k is the compact of the material line in 1934 h whitney established the necessary and sufficient conditions on the sequence of continuous to k functions in which it is followed by sequential derivatives of some function infinitely differentiated on the axis the totality of all such sequences whitney jets is denoted by the symbol e k many authors b s mityan e bierstone w pavlucki and w plesniak r t seeley m tidten d vogt a p goncharov etc the following task was considered what additional conditions should be satisfied with the compact k in which there is a linear continuous operator from e k to the space e of all functions infinitely differentiated on the axis at the same time e and e k are endowed with the natural topologies of fresche spaces we outline the close connection of this task with the implementation of markov inequality for the polynomas for the compact in 1961 b s mittyan showed that there is no such operator for a single point compact but there is for a segment until now the complete characterization of all compacts for which the answer is affirmative has not been received the report will present a new method of solving this problem based on the theory of duality of local convex spaces by converting the cats of linear continuous functionals a description of the spaces conjugated with e k as an analytical spaces outside k functions that disappear in infinity and having a certain growth near k this description plays a key role and allows you to solve the task formulated above in terms of capacitive properties of extensions compact k in a complex plane along the way a new evidence of whitney s theorem itself is given in the continuation in one case note that the problem under consideration can be posed in a multidimensional situation however the methods proposed in the report are still significantly one dimensional 3
