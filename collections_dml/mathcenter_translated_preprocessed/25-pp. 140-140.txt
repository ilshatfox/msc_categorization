the effect of the shielding and localization of the echo zone on the asymmetry of shaping is solved the task of inpatient electrochemical dimensional form formation taking into account the anode polarized screen in the interelectrode gap and insoluble coating the surface of the detail the decision was obtained with the involvement of the theory of reverse mixed regional tasks of analytical functions of a comprehensive variable the setting of the problem allows its hydrodin interpretation when solving the method of the year of the graph was used the mathematical parameters of the problem are from the solution of the system of nonlinear equations the developed algorithm made it possible to analyze the results in direct production for the cottage the impact on the asymmetry of the shaping of various locations of the specified screen and coating has been established examples of calculations illustrating the localization of processing are under the considered variants of dimensional electrical processing are made before v v klyuchev yoshkar ola key marsu ru the necessary condition for the slow convergence of the class of solutions to the reverse problem of the koshi in the banach space consider the problem of the koshi for the abstract parabolic equation dx dt ah o x o x 0 here a d a with x t x in the general case the unlimited operator in the banach space x d a x denote k ip l e largli ip u ip e 0 7 r suppose that the operator a has a compact reverse l 1 x t x the spectrum a a belongs to the half year l e s iimli f t rel 2 a where pho 0 71 2 a o and 140 is performed
