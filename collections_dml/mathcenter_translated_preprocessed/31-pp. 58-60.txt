mutual non polar hyperplos in the projective metric space of e n egorova chuvash state pedagogical university cheboksary stolyarovav chgpu edu ru is devoted to the study of mutual semi polar non paulic hyperpolosa distributions of m dimensional linear elements immersed in the n dimensional metric space kn with the absolute q 2 n 1 invariant methods of differential geometric studies are involved in the study namely the method of external differential forms of e cartan 6 and the continuation method and coverage of g f laptev 1 the following values are accepted everywhere below k l 0 n i k l 1 n i j k s 1 m 0 m v m 1 n 1 m 1 n consider the n dimensional projective space pn derive formulas of the projective rapper r a and structural equations of the projective space have the form 6 da k ak d k k l k l l l 0 according to a p nordena 2 the kn space with a projective metric or projective metric space 1 is the projective space pn in which a fixed hyperkvadrika q 2 n 1 absolute is set in the case of a 0 q 2 n 1 the equation of the absolute space of the kn can be written in the form of 3 aikx ixk 1 c gi 0 x i cx 0 2 0 a ik 0 g 0 i gi 0 59 g 00 c c c c c c c c c c c c c cost 6 0 aik gik gi 0 gk 0 c and the condition of its immobility is determined by the equations daik ailppi alk li 1 c ailgk 0 aklgi 0 l 0 dgi 0 gl 0 li c 0 i ailponl 0 in the kn space we consider the regular non upper hyperpolosa h that is the regular hyperpolosa distribution of m dimensional linear elements m n 1 1 it is known 5 that relative to the first order of the first order the submarine h is determined by the system of differential equations ni n ik k 0 v i v ik k 0 n v a n v 0 i v n i vk k 0 by analogy with the hyperpolosa 4 under the dual normalization of the regular hyperpolos distribution h kn we will mean the normalization of its basic distribution in the sense of a p norden that is at each point a 0 h the planes of nn m and nm 1 are given such as such as that nn m a 0 m a 0 a 0 nn m a 0 m a 0 kn nm 1 a 0 m a 0 a 0 nm 1 a 0 the planes of nn m a 0 and nm 1 a 0 are called respectively by the normals of the first and second birth at point a 0 h at the same time in each center a 0 the normal of the first kind nn m a 0 contains a characteristic n m 1 a 0 of the current element m a 0 equipping the distribution of hypercoptic elements theorem 1 for regular hyperpolosa distribution h m dimensional elements specified in the projective metric space kn with the absolute q 2 n 1 and allowing 60
