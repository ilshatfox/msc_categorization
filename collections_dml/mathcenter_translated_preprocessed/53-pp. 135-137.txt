student science stem technologies in the theory of numbers in mathematics have a number of results where the use of extensive machine calculations is absolutely necessary there are similar tasks available to schoolchildren and students and in theo rii of numbers 3 an additional incentive is that the task may not have a universally recognized solution and its occupation is not just a training training but a real scientific experiment at the advanced lines of knowledge exactly what is the spirit of stem technologies science technology engineering mathematics 1 example 1 study of the properties of the euler function n the sum of the values of the function of euler 136 m v rozhkova a v horns n i 1 n 3 n 2 2 o n lnn we denote the arithmetic mean value of the euler function through n in the gap 4 p 8 r 5 package we conducted the following experiment for all n 1010 the inequality is performed 0 2 n 3 n 2 0 8 very rarely but the approach turned out to be a lack not an excess all differences lie inside the interval of a single length i e the evaluation of the difference as o lnn may not be true example 2 construction of natural numbers obtained by the consistent application of the function f which is natural a a 1 a 2 an in correspondence f a ak 1 a k 2 a k n we do not know whether this task was solved by someone earlier but the result is new a package of computers of the keys on the open code sage 7 3 was used theorem let a a 1 a 2 an f a a k 1 a k 2 a k n then the sequence is a f a f f a can only end with the following cycles k 2 2 cycles 1 4 16 37 58 89 145 42 20 k 3 9 cycles 5 lengths 1 2 lengths 2 and 3 k 4 6 cycles 4 lengths 1 and 1 length 2 and 7 k 5 16 cycles 7 lengths 1 2 lengths 2 and 10 1 length 4 6 24 28 44 k 6 7 cycles 2 lengths 1 1 length 2 3 4 10 25 k 7 17 cycles 6 lengths 1 2 lengths 2 1 length 3 6 12 14 21 27 30 56 93 a salamatin z f miftakhova 137 l and treet ura 1 rozhkova v rozhkovam v teaching mathematics and computer science in leading universities in the world and experience of cuba gu materials of the i all russian scientific and practical conf aunt university in the search and support system for mathematically gifted children and youth maykop 2015 s 116 121 2 hardy g h an introduction to theory of numbers 6 th edition oxford university press 2008 642 p 3 rozhkova v nisselbaumo v theoretical and appropriation methods in cryptography textbook tyumen publishing house of tyumen state university 2007 160 c a a salamatin z f miftakhova kazan volga federal university arthur salamatin 2 gmail com zila 5 94 m gmail com auto modified solutions in supercritical fluid extraction model of supercritical fluid extraction usually consists of two equations in the case of plant material with a high initial content of extracted substances the macroscopic equation of the filtration of the solvent can be recorded in a sistational approximation 1 the second equation of the model describes the microscopic diffusion transfer extract at the level of a separate particle of crushed raw materials the approach of a tapering nucleus is often used here the workers also consider particles of a flat plate form
