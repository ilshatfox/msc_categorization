some properties of b manifolds let v 2 n riema nnian manifold with metric g if v 2 k ip is a n almost algebraic manifold with pure metric we say that v 2 k ip g is an almost b manifold b metric on b manifold is called holomorphic if where is the tachibana operator here we consider holomorphic b manifold which is a nalogous to the kahler manifolds an almost b manifold is holomorphic bmanifold if and only if the almost algebraic structure is parallel with respect to the levi civita connection 303
