periodic problem for a mixed type equation of the second kind r s khairullin for amixed type equation of the second kind we investigate a boundary value problem in a rectangular domain on the sides of the rectangle the condition of periodicity is set on the bas from the rectangle the value of the desired function is given on the particular line gluing conditions are specified the solution is constructed as the sum of a series sufficient conditions for the given functions and geometry of the domain that ensure the existence of the solution are found the criterion of unique is established keywords strong degeneracy second kind equation periodic problem udc 517 9 invariant diversity and laxe pairs for integrated equations of a r khakimova 1 1 aigul khakimova mail ru the institute of mathematics with the computing center of the ufa ras in the work discusses the direct method of finding parlias for non linear integrated equations in private derivatives and their discrete analogues based on the concept of generalized invariant diversity a generally invariant variety is a common differential equation joint with linarization of a given equation the oma selected by the oma allows you to build a pair of laxation for the original nonlinear equation key words nonlinear integrated equations linearized equation invariant diversity pair of laxa a pair of laxa is an important tool for studying nonlinear integrated equations it allows hamiltonov to find a structure integrates of movement higher symmetries accurate and asymptotic solutions etc several methods of building pairs of laxa for integrated equations are known see for example 1 4 however the development of new approaches to the solution of this problem remains relevant currently there are a large number of integrated equations especially discrete ones which are poorly studied and the available methods for constructing a pair of laxa do not always lead to the result 358 materials of the school conference in our works 5 10 a new method of searching for pairs of laxa for integrated equations is proposed we emphasize that our method uses the idea close to the well known method of pseudo potential walquist estabruk 2 where both lax equations are at the same time the difference between our approach is that as the first equation of the representation of the laxation we take the linearization of a given integrated equation the second equation of the pair will be an ordinary differential equation jointly jointly with this linearized equation we call the ode found in this way a generalized invariant diversity omi it should be noted that oma suitable for building a pair of laxa is usually nonlinear in fact at the first stage we find a non linear pair of laxation and then linearize it using the corresponding transformation since we are looking for only one of two equations our method is quite effective briefly set out the essence of the method consider the non linear equation in private derivatives of the type ut f x t u ux uxx uk u j j u x j 1 linearize the equation 1 ut f u f ux dx f uxx d 2 x f uk dkx u 2 we will attribute to linarization 2 an ordinary differential equation um f x t u ux uxx um 1 u ux uxx un 3 where u u x t the desired function and the function u u x t which is a certain solution of equation 1 is included in 3 as a functional parameter the determination of the equation 3 determines the generalized invariant variety omi for the equation 1 if the condition is dmx ut d tum 1 2 3 0 is performed identically for all variables u j andu ux um 1 here variables ut ut and their derivatives in x are replaced by virtue of equations 1 and 2 and variables um um 1 due to equality 3 since variables x t u ux uxx um 1 u ux uxx un un 1 in equation 3 are independent the task of finding the function f x t u ux um 1 u ux un is redeemed and effectively solved the following two classes of generalized invariant diversity are considered in our works 1 s i j 0 i j u u 1 uiu j k 0 2 m j 0 j u u 1 u j 0 a r khakimova 359 where k is arbitrary permanent in the first case when the oma is set by the non linear equation the equations system 2 3 forms a nonlinear pair of laxation for the equation 1 which comes to linear transformations in the second case when oma is set by a linear equation such an important object in the theory of integration such as the recursion operator is easily displayed from equality the effectiveness of the method of building a pair of laxa and the recursion operator is tested with numerous examples see 5 10 the study was carried out at the expense of the grant of the russian scientific fund project no 15 11 20007 literature 1 zakharov v e shabat a b accurate theory
