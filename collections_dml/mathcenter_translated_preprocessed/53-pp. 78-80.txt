the study of the dynamics of a piece of curve display with the parameter is a simple discrete dynamic system is determined by a certain function f x x and the infinite sequence of its iterations the main task of describing such a system we are to study the behavior of the orbit of any point x from d r kadyrov a i kukushkina a d pechenkina a a rakhimov 79 areas of determination x function f in the last decade the study of the dynamics of the symmetric and asymmetric stunt like piece line display has been given serious attention the spectrum of the application of these displays in biology ecology robotics electroenergy and electrical engineering economics and social on uki is widely represented see e g 1 5 one of the directions of further study of the tumor of different reflection is the study of the case when the function f is not a piece of line an example of such functions that can be of interest to applications is f x ax 0 6 x 6 1 ax x 1 1 the study of the dynamics of the display 1 which depends on three parameters is very difficult task therefore we consider some particular cases when showing the degrees in the system are recorded and f depends on one parameter a in the work the dynamics of two non linear ten to shaped displays with fractional degrees of the variable including negative f 1 x ax 1 2 0 6 x 6 1 ax 1 3 x 1 f 2 x ax 3 2 0 6 x 6 1 ax 1 3 x 1 for all the intervals of the settings of parameter a obtained during the study fixed points and periodic orbits of data data the types of these points and orbits were found built web and bifur casual diagrams thus a complete description of the orbit of any point x from the area of determination of each of the functions f 1 and f 2 is given 80 d v captain m e suslova l and tr t r a 1 brockwell p j autoregressions generated by the tent map preprint tech univ munchen 2002 4 p 2 jianxin liu xuan zhang zhiming li and xuling li a tent map based conversion circuit for robot tactile sensor journal of sensors v 2013 2013 5 p 3 wang shuang xin li han zhang xiu xia wang zhi qin nonlinear predictive load control of boiler turbine generation unit optimization 2 nd chaotic modeling and simuling and simuling and simuling and simuling and simuling and simuling and simuling and simulant conf crete greece 2009 4 avrutin v schanz m multi parametric bifurcations in a scalar piecewiset linear map nonlinearity 2006 v 19 no 8 5 sushko i agliarib a gardinic l et al bifurcation structure of parameter plane for a family of unimodal piecewise smooth maps border collision bifurcation curves chaos solitons fraactals 2006 v 29 no 3 p 756 770 d v kapitanov m e suslova national research nizhny novgorod state university named after n i lobachevsky dis kdv mail ru mariya suslova 96 mail ru the study of the non custody of elastic systems for the example of a free rod in the work examines small flat low frequency oscillations of a homogeneous direct free rod the longitudinal dimensions of which are much larger than transverse to
