mathematical models of hydromechanics of multiphase environments to numerical studying of non stationary processes in non uniform low temperature plasma d a tukmakov the mathematical model of quasi neutral dusty plasma condensed phase of which has multifraction structure is presented by the particles having various size and consisting of substances with various physical properties the offered model of dusty plasma is developed on the basis of the polydisperse multi speed and multitemperature gas suspension dynamics theory taking into account speed and temperature delay of the condensed fractions particles at the same time it is supposed that disperse inclusions represent the spherical particles differing in the size and materials which particles consist of they can have various density and heat conductivity keywords mathematical model dynamics of dust plasma polydisperse structure 517 98 1 2 1 ekaterina turilova kpfu ru 2 hamhalte math feld cvut cz czech technical university in prague aw i i i i 2 aw c a e a a a a 0 a 1 aw 3 c a r a 0 a a e a 0 a aw a e a a a 0 a 1 a aw s e a a s b e b e a 0 368 c a b j a b j a j a j a 2 j a 2 a a a b a a p q p q p q a a a s b a s b a b e a a e a e a e a e a a e a r a f 0 1 0 1 a f a a a a f a a e a a a b ab 0 aw a 1 a aw i 2 a j p j p p 1 a aw i 2 a j a a f 0 1 0 1 a j f a a e a 369 aw 2 i ii
