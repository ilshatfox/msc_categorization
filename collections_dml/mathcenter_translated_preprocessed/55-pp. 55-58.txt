nonlocal boundary value problem for a hyperbolic equation with singular coefficient n v zaitseva we consider a nonlocal boundary value problem for a hyperbolic eth a singular coefficient in a rectanguelar domain the existence unique and stability of the solution of the problem are established by means of the spectral method the solution of the problem is obtained in an explicit form as sum of a fourier bessel series its convergence is prved in the class of regular solutions keywords nonlocal problem hyperbolic equation singular coeffic fourier bessel series stability udc 519 7 on some schemes of partial darkened signatures using the complexity of the problem of a discrete logarithm a i ziyatdinova 1 1 aiziyatdinova ksu ru kazan volga federal university institute of mathematics and mechanics n i lobachevsky provides new examples of partial darkened digital signatures based on the complexity of the task of a discrete logarithm key words darkened digital signatures partial darkened signatures the task of a discrete logarithm a variety of darkened digital signatures either blind or signatures blindly 1 are partial darkened signatures 2 there are quite a few examples of such signatures including the problem of a discrete logarithm based on complexity see for example 3 in our work two more examples of signatures of this type are described a feature of partial darkened signatures partelly blind signatures is that for signing along with a darkened value this may be an electronic banknote identifier an open parameter is sent which is used in the signing algorithm in the article 4 signatures similar to the digital signature of the el gamal the authors represent some types of signatures that are most effective for the client the buyer and signing the bank consider these signatures schemes 56 materials of the youth school conference are given two open large simple numbers p q and q p 1 in the field zp 0 1 2 p 1 the open element of the order q was selected for a digital signature a random number sa z p 1 is selected and p is calculated p a sa mod p in this case sa is a secret key to the signing and p a is an open key these values remain constant for all signed messages to sign the message m zp 1 the signing selects the random number k zp 1 calculates r k mod p and solves the equation s sa m r k mod p 1 relative to the parameter s troika m r s signed message the correctness of the signature can be carried out by checking the equality of r s pm ra mod p further the authors 4 represent some other options for the meta el hamal digital signatures which are as effective as the scheme discussed above to sign the message the client calculates the equation and the bank checks the validity of the corresponding comparison presented in the next list 1 s m r sa k s pm ra r 2 s sa k m r s p ar m r 3 s sa m r k m m s pm ra r 4 s sa k m r m m s p ar m r 5 s s sa m r k r r s pm ra r 6 s sa k m r r r s p ar m r consider the darkened version of the digital signature in this case there are three participants in the protocol of which only two are important for us the bank that signs and the client alice who withdraws money from the account and sends the bank a darkened identifier m when the bank signed this identifier the client removes the darkening and receives an electronic banknote e cash we will sign the diagram in detail 1 the bank signing generates a random number k zq calculates r k mod p and sends r to the client 2 the client in turn selects random numbers a b zq and calculates r r a b mod p and m a 1 m r r mod q the calculated m is sent to the bank 3 the bank signs the darkened message m calculating s sn m r k mod q then s is sent to the client 4 the client calculates s as b mod q by the signed message electronic banknote is the three m r s in order to find out whether the signature is correct you need to check the following comparison sr pm rn mod p or s pm rn r 1 mod p a i ziythdinova 57 will further consider signatures 1 and 3 from the list presented above therefore imagine their darkened options that are offered in 4 1 m a 1 m r r s as b 3 m a 1 m r r s a m s b m the tests remain the same as the corresponding to the interpreted versions in case 1 s pm rn r in case 3 s m pm rn r or s pm rn r m in the process of checking the signatures inaccuracies in the work were revealed 4 therefore we had to slightly modify some data in these two versions firstly in both cases the r calculated by the client will change it will have the form r r a b secondly an unknown signature will change in the version 3 which
