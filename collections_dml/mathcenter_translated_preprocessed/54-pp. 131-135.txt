approximation of gradient of the convex functions based on triangulation e g grigorieva v a klyachin the class of triangulations of a finite set of p points in rn similar to classical delaunay triangulation is introduced such triangulations are constructed using the condition of empty intersection with the set p of the interior of every convex set from a given family of convex bounded sets whose boundary contains vertices of the simplex of the triangulation in this case the classical delaunay triangulation corresponds to the family of all balls in rn we use of triangulations to obtain estimates of the error of approximation of the derivatives of c 2 smooth convex functions by piecewise linear functions keywords delaunay triangulation empty sphere condition convex set families piecewise approximation 512 573 512 562 1 k c 1 2 3 1 gsuren inbox ru 2 elipacheva gmail com 3 airat vm rambler ru c 1 c c 1 132 c k ha ba a b k k ha ba ha hb 1 2 3 5 6 k a and b k a b b a k a b k c k a c b c k ha ba a b k ha ean n 1 ba ha hb a b ean n 1 e b n n 1 ca cb ba a b c k 6 b a b a b a b a k 1 p a 0 p b p 1 a b p b a p 1 a b p b a a a a a ia 0 p 1 pn 0 pi 1 1 pi i 2 n p p pn pn 1 p 1 1 p 1 p 1 p 0 p 0 pn p 1 p 11 p 12 p 1 n p q p q p q p 0 q 0 1 p 0 q 0 s k a b c k a b c 1 a b b c a c 2 c b b a c a 3 b a a b ib a b b a ia 4 a b ib a b ia a b a b 133 5 b a ia b a ib b a b a 6 ia ia ia p s 0 p 1 p ga a k a 6 ga s ia s k ga k a b k p 0 p a 1 p b k 6
