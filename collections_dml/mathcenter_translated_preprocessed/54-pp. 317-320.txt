torsional rigidity of simply connected domain r g salakhudinov in this paper we give a brief survey of isoperimemetric inequalities connenecting the torsional rigidity and geometric characteristics of a plane domain a number of new statements are also stated some old and new hypotheses are formulated keywords isoperimetric inequality torsional rigidity euclidean moment of domain with respect to the boundary extremal domain udc 517 54 the solution of the heterogeneous regional problem of riman on the beam with an endless index of the new method of r b salimov 1 a z suleimanov 2 1 salimov rsb gmail com kazan state architectural and construction university 2 ayaz suleymanov 91 mail ru the kazan state architectural and civil engineering university considers the regional task of riemann with an endless index when the regional condition of the problem is set on a positive real axis of the complex plane to solve this problem an approach is used based on the elimination of 318 materials of the international school conference of the infinite rupture of the argument of the regional condition condition using a specially selected analytical function keywords riman s regional task analytical function endless index let d is the area in the plane of the complex variable z x i y the boundary of which is the positive real half axis l it is required to determine the function tail z analytical and limited in the area d if its boundary values satisfy the condition t g t t t g t t g t t t g t t l 1 where t t the limit values of the functionart function for z t respectively on the left and right when respectively z 0 and z 0 g t a given function that satisfies the condition of the helder on l g t hl g urb 0 coefficient g t a given function with the following properties ln g t hl argg t t t 2 specified numbers 0 0 12 t a given function t hl in article 1 a solution to riemann s homogeneous problem is given when in the regional condition 1 there is no term g t by eliminating the endless gap of argg t using a specially selected analytical function it is simplicity and transparency in comparison with the decision developed by n v govorov the founder of the scientific direction devoted to the tasks of riman with an endless index 2 p 113 123 brief information about the development of this scientific direction is given in 1 in this paper the approach used in the article 1 is used to find a private solution of the regional problem 1 take the function e z e i z 0 arg z 2 2 ec sin analytic in the area d the boundary values of which e t the boundary values of e t designated as in the case of t satisfy the equality e t e t e i t 3 for z r ei r 0 0 2 we have e r ei exp cos 2 sin sin 2 sin r r r r 4 the regional condition 1 multiplying by e t and designating g 1 t e t e t g t ei argg t imagine this t e t g 1 t t e t e t g t t l 5 and by force 2 3 g 1 t g t ei t 6 r b salimov a z suleimanov 319 as can be seen from the formula 4 at 0 and 2 r t e t e t exp 1 cos 2 sin t with t urb to eliminate this feature in the regional condition 5 we take a whole function with negative zeros f z k 1 1 zrk 0 r 1 r 2 it is easy to check 3 p 272 that for this function for z t 0 there is a ratio of lnf t t l n n x d x x x t 7 where n x denotes the number of zeros r 1 r 2 functions f z for which rk x we assume that for the indicated zeros there is the final limit of lim x x x 0 it can be shown that with t 0 the formula 7 can be represented like this 2 p 125 lnf t thank you t i t i t t mm 0 n x xp x x t 8 in this formula as in the work 2 p 127 we take n x x 12 an entire part of the amount x 12 then rk 2 x 12 than 1 1 k 1 2 considering that with 0 z r t 0 according to 4 lne 1 cos i 1 2 t we choose the number which is included in the formula 8 so that thank you 12 cos then the function f z will be determined completely at the same time on the basis of the result of the tats of the book 2 p 128 we conclude that e t f t g t hl for simplicity without limiting the community we will accept that for the function g t t of formulas 6 conditions are met g 0 1 0 0 g urb lim t g t 1 lim t t 0 g 0 0 we determine the analytical and limited function in area d 4 p 119 z 12 i l lng 1 x d x x z the values of which on l t t satisfy the condition hl 5 s s 61 66 68 in addition 0 5 p 68 the function z e z is an analytical in region d and its boundary values satisfy the regional condition t g 1 t t 4 p 109 1 given the latter kra
