we denote the polynomial extensions of the invariant algebra through a x 1 xn algebra of the polynomes above a certain algebra a from the committing unknown x 1 xn they say that algebra b is a polynomial expansion of algebra a a c b if b a b 1 b 1 bn e s let k g category of uniform algebra on compact the connected trial group g algebra a k g is called polynomically closed if it does not have non trivial polynomial explosions in the category k g let the additive group g isomorphic group group g and s some underput group in g in g containing a single element and generating the gem group s is called a l gobrai which is called from the condition of pa s and e g n e n the theorem if algebrai is closed then it is closed then algebra of all continuous functions for g the spectrum of which is contained in s is jav 1 l l am an amplified a l gubra literature 1 arens r singer 1 generalized apapalytic fipctiops tran amer math soc 1956 v 81 r 379 393 2 grigoryan s a on polynomial extensions of the switching banach algebra umn 1984 t 39 nol 225 p 129 130 3 grigoryan s a pankrateva t n tonev t v the validty range of two strex analysis theorets complex variases 2002 v 47 no 12 r 1085 1095 211
