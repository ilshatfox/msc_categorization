conformal display of half plate on the circular polygon i a kolesnikov 1 1 ia kolesnikov mail ru national research tomsk state university in the work received an integro reduced equation to display complex half plane on a circular polygon with the help of this equation and differential equation of the schwartz a representation is written for the acersor parameters of mk key words conformal display accessor parameters circular polygon let a circular n angle with peaks at points a 1 a 2 an 1 22 n angles at these vertices let the side of the a 1 an circular nang lies on the material axis curve l t 1 tn a 1 an a piece of iron tk ak curvature of curve l is constant at tk tk 1 t 1 n 1 the tangent to the curve l at the point forms an angle with a material axis we denote through f f holomorphic and single leaf display of the upper half fluidity on a circular n angle the prototypes of the vertices a 1 a 2 an when displayed are denoted through a 1 a 2 an the prototype of the point line through tk ak theorem display f satisfies the equation ln f z n k 1 k ln z q 1 n 1 k 1 tk 1 tk ln z dison c 1 where c is the constant k k 1 formula 1 is obtained using the integral formula of the koshi note that in the case when all sides of the circular n angle are rectilinear segments i e 0 t 1 tn formula 1 will take the form of the christophle shvartz formula a special case of formula 1 when a circular n angle is a plane with a section on a smooth curve consisting of two arcs of circles was obtained in 1 see also 2 it is known that the display f satisfies the differential equation 200 materials of the schwartz international schwartz school conference f z f z 1 2 f z f z 2 n k 1 1 1 2 k 2 z ak 2 mk z ak 2 finding the derivative of the schwarz of the display f from the equation 1 and comparing it with the right side of the equation 2 we get the following representation for the parameters mk mk n j 1 j k k j ak q j 1 lim z ak z q n k 1 k z ak n 1 k 1 tk 1 tk 1 z d 1 2 n 1 k 1 tk 1 tk 1 z d 2 n 1 k 1 tk 1 tk 1 z 2 d this work was carried out with the support of a program to increase international competitiveness of tomsk state university for 20132020 literature 1 kufarev p p on one special family of single leaf functions scientific notes of tomsk university 1947 t 5 s 22 36 2 proceedings of p p kufareva on the 100 th anniversary of the birth under the total ed i a alexandrova tomsk publishing house ntl 2009 372 p conformal mapping of a half plane onto a circular polygon i a kolesnikov in this paper we obtain an integro differential equation for mapping of half plane ato a circular polygon using this equation and the schwarz differential equation we get a representation for the accessory parameters mk keywords conformal mapping accessory parameters circular polygon udc 514 752 44 514 772 517 548 izothermic coordinates on the non custody of the two dimensional surfaces of a n kondrashov 1 1 alexander kondrashov volsu ru volgograd state university is investigating the existence and uniqueness of isothermal coordinates on glued surfaces in rm such surfaces are a special case of non alcohol surfaces for them an analogue of the famous theorem v m milkova 2004
