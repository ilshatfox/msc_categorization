the integral equation of the task of diffraction of the electromagnetic wave on the curved metal screen 1 tumakov kazan state university studied the task of koshi for the helmholtz equation in an unlimited area with a curved border the integral equation of fredgolm of the 1 st genus was obtained to which a flat task of diffraction of the electromagnetic wave on a curved metal screen is reduced 1 the derivative of normal and private derivatives will establish the relationship between the derivative in normal to the schedule of the monotonous function z f x in the two dimensional case and derivatives in the directions of the coordinate axes as you know the derivative of normal to the smooth curve of the function u x z can always be expressed through its private derivatives in 1 p 72 it is shown that for a monotonously waning function u n u x f x x u z 1 x 1 where x 1 f x 2 we show that formula 1 is also preserved in the case of an increasing function f x indeed for the angle between the axis x and the tangent to the curve tan f x then cos nx cos 2 sin 1 cos 2 tan 1 tan 2 1 work was supported by the fund of the republic of tatarstan 219 the integral equation of the task of diffraction cos nz cos 1 tan 2 and formula 1 follows from the formula u n u x cos nx u z cos nz 2 the task of the koshi for the region with the curved border we consider the task of the koshi for the helmholtz equation with the material coefficient in the area of z f x we build a solution to the equation 2 u x 2 2 u z 2 k 2 u 0 z f x ura x urb 2 satisfying the boundary conditions u n x f x a 1 x u x f x a 0 x mm x ged 3 complete the desired decision by zero to the entire plane and we will consider it as a distribution of slow growth from the sobolevsky space h loc 1 220 d n tumakov theorem 9 distribution u x z is a solution to the problem of koshi 2 3 when and only when the boundary functions satisfy the conditions ger mm a 1 x 1 f x 2 iacy 0 x f x i 0 hole a 0 x ei 0 hole f x i ingx dx 0 4 where 0 ctor k i nut 2 k 2 ctor k k 2 oring at the same time the image of fourier u satisfies the equation u 1 2 1 k 2 2 2 imes ura a 1 x 1 f x 2 2 iacy 0 x f x i a 0 x ei f x iising dx 5 proof we apply the double transformation of fourier to the equation 2 denote iz 1 2 et ipp x 2 u z 2 ei zdz ei recordx we convert the internal integral x 2 u z 2 ei zdz ger f x ei zd u z u z x f x ei f x f x ei zdu 221 integral equation of the task of diffraction u z x f x i u x f x ei f x 2 ger f x u ei zdz thus iz 2 u 1 2 mm u z x f x i u x f x ei f x iising dx 6 now consider the image of fourier ix 1 2 ura k vk z wk z 2 u x 2 eiunkdx ei zdz here wk z is the area of decrease of the function z f x vk z the area of increasing f x and k is the number of local extremum note that although the external integral in ix x z indicates endless limits in fact integration comes from min x f x to max x f x the internal integral how is it easy to see vk z wk z 2 u x 2 eiunkdx u x x z iising x z eiunk x vk z x wk z oring vk z wk z u eiunkdx consider the expression r mber k u x vk z z e i tip z u x wk z z e i standard z iising vk z z eiunk z i inst wk z z eiunk z ei zdz 222 d n tumakov will replace variables vk z x z f x x rk in the first and third terms and wk z x x f x x lk in the second and fourth terms here lk is an interval of decreasing function f x in the area of the perreum and rk is the interval of its increase note that k lk rk r then r k r k u x x f x eiason i f x f x f x dx l k u x x f x eiason i f x f x dx iaw r k u x f x eiason x f x dx i charge l k u x f x eiason i f x f x dx nder ura u x x f x f x ei charge i f x dx i charge ger ura u x f x f x ei mill i f x dx thus ix ran perf 1 2 imes ura u x x f x iason x f x f x ei charge i f x dx 7 after the double transformation of the fourier taking into account 6 7 and 1 we get k 2 ctor 2 2 u 1 2 et u n x f x 1 f x 2 223 integral equation of the task of diffraction iising x f x f x u x f x ei f x iising dx the function u e i h h min x f x should be analytically continued in the variable into the upper half plate the waves coming from infinity should also be absent we write the reverse transformation of the fourier of the expression standing on the right side 5 using the equality a b k 2 onic 2 2 1 2 0 perf b 0 a 0 b 0 a 0 we convert the integral m d t
