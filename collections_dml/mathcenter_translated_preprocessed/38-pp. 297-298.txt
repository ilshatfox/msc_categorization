the theorem of the existence and uniqueness of the solutions of the linear integrated equations of voltairer in the space of linear functions is denoted through s a b where qo the space of the functions that are determined on a b that have the end at each point a b the limits left and right and at point a has the final limit on the right it is known that if the function x t e s a b then it is limited on each for a fed segment from a b 1 consider the equation t x t j q t s x s ds f t t e a b 1 where q t s is determined at a s t b summarized at each t e a b by s for a t measurable in terms of variables in addition suppose that for q t s you are full of the ratio t s up j iq t s i ds se t e a b a 2 298 t n tsalyuk with j q t s ds e s a b s e a b 3 11 iq t s i k t s 4 and k t s satisfies the condition of radon 2 in addition we believe that q t s o t s and j t e s a b there is a theorem let y do q t s satisfy then the following are fairly approved i i 1 equation 1 has the only one in s a b a solution 2 t j t j r t s j s ds a 3 r t s satisfies the volume of yuh m equations of the dl literature 1 burbaki n the functions of a deil variable m science 1965 p 73 76 2 ts r yuk 3 b integral equalized i i volterra the results of the gi of science and technology vinity matte analysis 1977 t 15 s 131 18
