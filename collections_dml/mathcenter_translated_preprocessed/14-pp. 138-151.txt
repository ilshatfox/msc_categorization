some tasks associated with the functionality of the isoperimetric type the known isoperimetric inequality 1 b f sup e 1 2 f 6 1 e f 2 dival d 1 2 d f 1 144 majoring maximum conformal radius of the region f e its normalized area is the basis to compare the conditions of the uniqueness of the critical point of the conformal radius rf 1 2 f 2 in the form of restrictions on the prenatures of the flea and the airship of the pre vvartsan f f f 2 the idea of such a comparison was first put forward by one of the authors in the context of the permanent type of lechto see 3 and was implemented in 4 see also 5 and 6 for isperimetric expansion 1 this article is devoted to formalizing this idea with an application to a number of operators f 7 f 1 we introduce the necessary definitions and designations let h a class of functions holomorphic in e c 1 h 0 its subclass distinguished by the condition of local one leafness in e and standard standardization f 0 f 0 1 0 and let u many injections u h 0 h that cover the f family 0 f u h 0 0 3 through f we denote the many functionals l h 0 urb satisfying the conditions i l f monotonous and monotonous and monotonous and continuous function from 0 and l f 0 0 and lim ger l f urb ii for any u u the inclusion l f h l f 0 u h 0 and implication f l k f 1 where k f k f the number of critical points of the conformal radius 2 for function f associated with f ratio u f f the above conditions are in the same way as 3 are necessary for the correctness of some further definitions for l f we consider a number of l objects and above all the functionality l u 0 urb acting according to the formula l u sup l 0 l f 6 l f u h 0 k f 1 4 as well as l space l f h l f urb with open and closed l shars of l f g l l g f and l f g l l g f 6 l radius 0 with centers at points f l and l spheres l f lo f lo f the intention of l follows from the property i the set f f 0 l for any l f using just introduced objects functionality 4 145 can be recorded as follows l u sup l 0 k ll 0 u h 0 1 and in terms unity a l u f l u h 0 k f 1 in the form of l u sup l 0 ll 0 u h 0 a l u if the functionality l m f are connected by inequality l f 6 m f f h 5 and the image u h 0 l is in itself i e l f f u h 0 6 for any f l u h 0 and 0 6 that l g grain m mnity a m u is defined as la m u f m u h 0 0 1 k l f u h 0 where m is m space spring is true 1 let l 6 m on h then for any u u 0 and f m are the following ratios m l a m u a l u m f l f ma m u la m u la l u m la l u along with the sets a l u for different l we consider the set of a u f u h 0 k f 1 independent of the presence of l structures in h as well as functionality u sup 0 6 k f 1 the first exit of the f family from the set a u for a number of upper u uli a lot of a u will be star shaped by the beam f 0 i e the first output is the last u sup 0 k f 1 2 undertaken in this work the study is concentrated around the following two tasks 1 the problem of calculating l l u u u and an effective description of the intersections of l border of the uniqueness with l spheres with the center in zero 146 2 the problem of comparison l u and m u for functionals l m f satisfying the condition 5 for various u u in the work 2 it was established that b u d u 2 and a complete description of the intersections ba b u with b 2 0 and d 2 0 and da d u with d 2 0 where u f f the situation with the prenatures of the flea and a conductor for forewording the function from h 0 served as the prototype of the following general scheme which in particular shows that inequality 5 is always preserved when the species transition to functional 4 theorem 1 let u u and the functionality l m f satisfy the inequality l 6 m on h then l u 6 m u if u then m u and from equalities l u l f and l f m f 0 the ratio l follows u m u if in addition the image of u h 0 l everyone is carny in itself and l satisfies the inequality of the triangle then crossing the boundaries ma m u la m u and la l u with the ball mm u 0 is contained in the set l m f mm u 0 l f m f proof we show that l l u 6 m u m the case when l 0 or m trivial let 0 l and m we fix the arbitrary l 0 l and consider any function f u h 0 with m f 6 l many of these f is not empty due to the property i for m 3 and 6 taking into account 5 we get a chain of inequalities l f 6 m f 6 l l from where k f 1 according to 4
