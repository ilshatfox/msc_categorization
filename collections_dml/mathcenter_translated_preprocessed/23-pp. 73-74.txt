direct limits of hv modules in this paper the category of hv modules is considered also it is shown that the direct limit of every direct system always exist in this category direct limit are defined by a universal property and so are unique the most powerful tool in order to obtain a module from a given hv module is the quotient out procedure by use this method some results about the connection between the fundamental modules direct systems and direct limits is proved by considering the fundamental equivalence relation b solon ivanovo russia solon icti ivanovo su quasi minimality is a synonym of the non totality of enumeration degree we use notations and terminology similar to those of the monograph 1 we recall as 2 that a e b a is enumeration reducible to b if there is a uniform algorithm for enumerating a given any enumeration of b formally a e b n x x a u x u wn du b let as usual a e b a e b b e a and de a b b e a be e degree of a and de a de b a e b denote by de the set of e degrees partially ordered by and by 0 e the least element of de an e degree a is called non total if in it there are no total functions which are identified with their graphs let tot be the set of all total e degrees the first example of a non total e degree has given by medvedev 3 the medvedev s e degrees were named by case 4 quasi minimal later a is quasiminimal iff 0 e a f tot f a f 0 e 75 sasso 5 generalizes this notion relatively an e degree c a a is c quasiminimal iff c a f tot f a f c it is clear that any c quasi minimal e degree is non total whether but correctly the converse it appears not correctly as was shown in 6 there exist non total e degrees which are not c quasi minimal for any e degree c and still such non total e degrees somewhat also are quasi minimal in 7 slaman and sorbi have introduced the notion of i quasi minimal e degree where 6 i de is a set of e degrees a is i quasi minimal iff c i c a f tot f a c i f c theorem any non total e degree a is f quasi minimal for some f tot or f quasi minimal for some family of the total e degrees f fs forming a growing sequence f 0 f 1 fs a r e f e r e n c e s 1 soar r i recursively enumerable sets and degrees springer verlag berlin 1987 2 friedberg r rogers h reducibility and completeness for sets of integers zeit math log grund math 1958 v 5 p 117 125 3 medvedev u degrees of difficulty of the mass problem dokl akad nauk sssr 1955 v 104 p 501 501 4 case j enumeration reducibility and partial degrees ann of math 1971 no 2 p 419 439 5 sasso l a survey of partial degrees j symb log 1975 v 40 p 130 140 6 solon b local properties of the non total enumeration degrees computability and models kluwer academic plenum publishers new york 2003 p 351 370 7 slaman t sorbi a quasi minimal enumeration degrees and minimal turing degrees preprint 1996 p 1 26 76
