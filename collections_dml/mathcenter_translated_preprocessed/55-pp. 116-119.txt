materials of the youth school conference the use of elements of history in teaching mathematics z z rizvanov the article is devote to the us of elements of history of mathematics in the educational process it discusses various methods and forms of introduction of the historical material in teaching mathematics keywords history of mathematics teaching historical information udc 519 688 511 174 silovsky subgroups of the at group a v rozhkov 1 m v rozhkova 2 1 ros seminar bk ru kuban state university 2 ros seminar bk ru krasnodar college of management technology and technology studies silov s subgroups of the at groups above the sequence of final cyclic groups the issue was resolved from the coer notebook keywords group theory computer algebra packages silovsky subgroups groups of the group not local finite periodical groups the introduction of bernsidic groups is endless of course generated periodic groups the first instrumentation of the group given by the specified representation and not by the contact more precisely implemented in the form of the final machine is the design of s v aleshin 1 in 2 the design of aleshin was generalized and introduced by the at group class aleshinsky type groups or in a wider reading automorphisms of trees groups let a a 1 a 2 the sequence of sets each of which contains at least two elements kits u a 1 an ai ai we will call the arreas of length n u n we turn the set of all cules into a tree connecting the vertex u a 1 an and v a 1 an an an 1 n n the endless motorcade is a 1 a 2 an by the way in the tree t the tree t is clearly shown in the figure a 1 a 2 t any autorphism f wood fixing the initial peak is unambiguously set by a set of rearrangements of the ribs t placed in its peaks f f u u t where f u is a rearrangement of the set a u 1 placed in a v rozhkov m v rozhkova 117 vertex u the permutation f u will be called ue and if only the length n of the u peak u then the n th accompanying rearrangement of automorphism f definition automorphism f wood is called root if f is the only non identifying accompanying rearrangement of automorphism f let the a one nuclear path in the tree t automorphism f of wood is called longitudinal with the guide by if from f u 1 it follows that u 1 2 mb an 1 for some n n and an 1 an 1 moreover an 1 n 1 determination of at groups let f some of the root and longitudinal automorphisms of the tree t the g g r f group is called the at group over the sequence a if a group of permutations is n g r f u f f u n is transit on the many an 1 for any n n it should be noted that any at group is endless and has a trivial center 2 let g at group above the tree t let further u t u n the top and stg u the stabilizer of the vertex u groupg then the narrowing of the stg u on the support of tu with the initial vertex u is also an at group but above the sequence a n an 1 an 2 and its generative many will be tails longitudinal generating groups we will call this group n cutting and denote the most important case of at groups the most affordable proceedings are regular at groups definition if the sequence a a 1 a 2 consists of groups and all accompanying permutations f u are elements of the regular representation of the corresponding groups of an a total at group we will call regular the most important and most studied subclass of regular at groups is the class of at groups determination let the pan p 1 p 2 a sequence of simple numbers then a regular at group above the sequence of cyclic groups a ap 1 ap 2 is called at group regular at groups over the sequence of final cyclic groups should be noted that until now in any periodic at group that is not a p group silovsky subgroups have been found there were serious suspicions that in the class of periodic at group over a limited but not constant sequence all silovsky subgroups were locally finite therefore in 3 the question was raised about the silovsky subgroups in the more class of the at groups question 16 79 is it true that in any of the certainly generated at group above the sequence of cyclic groups the orders of which are limited all silovsky subgroups are locally finite however the class of final cyclic groups from cyclic groups of simple order is very different it is fundamentally important that a cyclic group of simple order is generated by any united element and this changes a lot for example in the case of a sequence of final cyclic groups there is a regular at group g which contains a subgroup f which is 118 material
