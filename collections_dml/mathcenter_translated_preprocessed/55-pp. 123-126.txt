about the object of curvature of a fundamental group connection of the 2 nd order n a ryazanov the second order curvature object contains the curvature object of the fundamental group connection defined in the principal bundle the curvature object of an affine connection over a manifold second order components differential comparisons for the components of the object of curvature of the second order fundamental group connection are made these comparisons show that the curvature object of the second order forms a geometric object only in combination with second order components connectivity object in the general case the object of curvature of the fundamental group connection of the second order does not form a tensor keywords structure equations of laptev fundamental group connection the second order curvature object 004 91 1 1 sabitovae 441 gmail com k 1 2 124 k k nearest neighbors algorithm knn k modified k nearest neighbors mknn knn mknn 3 k k r knn mknn 4 5
