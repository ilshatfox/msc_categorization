the structural properties of turing degrees containing the final pumping combinations of the listing sets of m m yamaleev kazan state university marsiam 2 yandex ru are considered 2 calculated for briefly 2 p see also 1 and also 1 3 p sets and their list of pureness regarding v p and 2 p sets in theorems 1 and 4 the enforcement of sets is studied relative to v p many and this issue is completely resolved some facts about the enforcement of 2 p the theorems 5 and 6 are given sets theorem 1 for an arbitrary 2 p sets a of its own 2 p the degree exists that is not comparable to it v p a lot of c such that a v p regarding c the next two theorems proven in the articles of arslanov la fort slavaman 2 and lemppa dooni la fort 3 respectively are well known theorem 2 let a b p c v p c 6 t a and a c 1 it has 2 pp degree 228 theorem 3 there is 3 b p a lot of a of the actual 3 p degree such that for all v p the sets of the multi variety a has w 1 a spectacle and only when w t 0 theorem 2 indicates that for n p n 3 sets from the actually n p the degrees do not make sense to consider the listness regarding v p sets located under them theorem 3 proves 0 priority reasoning and is the strongest result for the transmission relative to v p sets a weaker version of the theorem 3 by the 0 prio riteta is proven and this allows us to demand from the set a of theorem 4 additional properties for example a can be built over any v p the degree or a can be built such that the jump a will be equal to the jump in the specified v p sets theorem 4 there is 3 p a lot of a of the actual 3 p degree such that for all v p the sets are many a w 1 and only when w t 0 in addition some structural properties of turing degrees and the enemy relative to 2 p are considered sets the theorem 5 there is such a 2 p the set a a 1 a 2 from the actual 2 p the degree that the sets a a 1 a 2 are not comparable theorem 6 there is 3 p a lot of a such as for any 2 p sets b a b 1 a 6 t b as a result from here it is possible to obtain a fundamental once of lahlan sets for 2 p and 3 p sets the work was carried out with the support of the rffi project 05 01 00605 229 l and t e r a t r a 1 soar r i calculus enabled sets and a step of penalties kazan kazan matte o in 2000 2 arslanov m m laforte g l and slaman t a relative enumerablyity in the difference hierarchy j of symbolic logic 1998 v 63 no 2 p 411 420 3 lempp s downey r and laforte g a 02 set with barely 02 degree j of symbolic logic 1999 v 64 no 4 p 1700 1718 230
