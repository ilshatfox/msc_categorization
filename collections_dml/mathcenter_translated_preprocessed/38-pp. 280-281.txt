cases of factorization of the equation of the nth order of the nth order are considered cases of factorization of the equation where x x 1 hp i j i ik o t iz 1 n n k 01 1 l 0 i 2 1 n based on this presentation conditions were recorded the fulfillment of which ensures the possibility of lowering the equation 1 here we will talk about the development of these consequences a new one is introduced function u u a lli 3 in and 001 1 l oo s o a tikhonov 281 leading to the recording of equation 1 in the form a llis in a ol l a llis i a ol l a llis i x x 2 x x 2 a ooi 3 in a ool l a llis in u oois i q therefore if identity is performed ol i 3 in a jli 3 ip a ol l a llis ip q a xj 11 i 3 in a 101 l a l 1 is i a ol l a llis in axjx 2 xj x 2 a ooi 3 in a ool i a ili 3 i o where ik o t k 3 p iz in p 2 then the function and 2 of the udo enters the second order equation and the solution of the equation 1 will be by the solution of the equation of the order p 2 that is the problem of solving equation 1 is reduced to solving two equations 2 nd and p 2 of the order literature 1 zhegalov c and koshcheeva o a a decrease in the order of one class of equations with private nro production 11 dock ras 2006 vol 406 no 5 p 593 597
