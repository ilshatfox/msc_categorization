the study of one task of determining the voltage of the magnetic field of a given configuration methods of creating electromagnetic fields of a given configuration play an important role in solving various applied problems 1 2 in a quasi stationary magnetic approximation the equation for determining the voltage of the magnetic field can be written in the form of 3 4 4 c h x t t rot roth x t 4 c rot veste x t 1 div h x t 0 h x t 0 x h x t t 0 h 0 x x r 3 h x tfix e st x tfix r 3 const 0 where h is the magnetic field strength vector is a given vector function which is often considered specified by an electromagnetic field which is not an electromagnetic nature by origin in the future we will consider the isaader 80 a field chisel c is the speed of light in a vacuum is the magnetic permeability of the medium is the specific conductivity of the medium the system 1 is considered in the area qt 0 t the following spaces are introduced in the report v 1 0 2 qt u l 2 qt 3 rotu l 2 qt 3 div u 0 with a scalar work u v v qt t 0 u v rotu rot dx dt and o v 1 0 2 qt as a closure in v 1 0 2 qt smooth functions equal zero in the vicinity of the side surface of the cylinder qt the concept of a generalized solution of h is t of the task 1 corresponding to the source of the field is introduced and theorems of its existence and uniqueness in the class o v 1 0 2 qt are proved the results are planned to be used in the future to solve the reverse problem of creating an electromagnetic field of a given configuration the essence of which is to find the source of the field of the isom in which the electromagnetic field will have at the time of time t t a given configuration h x t h x to solve this problem it is planned to use the dual regulatory algorithm 6 7 i thank the scientific advisers of associate professor a v kalinin and professor m i sumin for setting the task and assistance in work the work was supported by the russian federation project 07 01 00495 l and t r a t r a 1 galaninm p popovy p quasistational electromagnetic fields in heterogeneous environments m fizatlit 1995 81 2 pigonge l sabonnadierzh k cad in electrical engineering m mir 1988 3 tolmachevv v golovina m potapovv s thermodynamics and electrodynamics of a continuous environment m publishing house of moscow state university 1988 4 tammi e fundamentals of electricity theory m physayatlit 2003 5 ladyzhenskaya o a solonnikov v a uraltsevan n linenic and quasi line equations of the parabolic type m science 1967 6 suminm i the regulatory gradient dual method of solving the reverse problem of the final observation for the parabolic equation zh calculation mat and matte physical 2004 t 44 no 11 c 2001 2019 7 suminm i regularization in the linearly convex task of mathematical programming based on the theory of duality j calculation mat and matte physical 2007 t 47 no 4 c 602 625 i a kozlov kazan state university garevo mail ru restoration of the temperature field of rocks in the vicinity of the well according to its thermometry after stopping the temperature of the rocks in the vicinity of the vertical discharge well fundamentally depends on the presence of 82
