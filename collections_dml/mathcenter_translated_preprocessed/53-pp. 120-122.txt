the laminar dynamo is considered the task of moving the conductive viscous fluid between the non center rotating sphere it is believed that the center of symmetry of the internal sphere of shifts of the chickpeas relative to the center of the external sphere in the equatorial plane at a short distance within the framework of this model the solution of the problem of hydrodynamics that does not take into account the influence of the magnetic field on the movement of fluid allows you to obtain a radial course 1 in this paper the question of the possibility of generating a magnetic field by the fluid by the fluid found in 1 we write down the equations of magnetic hydrodynamics 2 in the ends of measured form rot v t v v s rot h h rot v 1 h t rm rot v h h 2 div v 0 3 div h 0 4 v v novikov l n february 121 where c 2 4 s i 2 c 2 rm 4 v r c 2 t 4 r 2 c 2 r is the scale of the length t the scale of the current i the scale of the current v characteristic flow rate the conditions of a small parameters 1 s 1 allow you to neglect nonlinear members in 1 and reduce the system 1 3 to the sequential solution 1 the equations of hydrodynamics 1 3 without taking into account the influence of the mage of the native field on the movement of the fluid considered in 1 2 the equations of induction 2 together with the equation of inequality 4 with a certain course of v the solution of equations 2 4 is searched in the form of a row according to the ball vectors 2 h r e t l 1 2 m 6 l lm r y lm 0 lm r y 0 lm lm r y lm by grouping the coefficients in front of ball vectors with the same indices we get a system of ordinary differential linear linear equations relative to radial functions lm r after replacing derived with diverse analogues the task boils down to finding the k of the truncated system of interest is the value of with the greatest active part dependence on the magnetic number of reynolds rm for l 1 2 is built the critical value of rkp m is established in which the actual part becomes positive in this case the magnetic field is excited 3 for l 1 the value of rkp m 32 for l 2 value rkp m 29 122 p a novikov results can be useful in the study of the influence of convective currents in a liquid core on a geo magnetic field the work was carried out with financial support from the rffi about the ect 15 01 08326 l and t r a t r a 1 novikov v february l n the fluid between the non certificate spheres that make a dipphy rencial rotation scientist zap kazan un te ser physical matte science 2016 t 158 no 1 c 129 140 2 petrasheng i dynamic tasks of the theory of elasticity in the case of isotropic sphere scientific notes of lip a series of mathematical sciences 1949 issue 17 no 114 c 2 27 3 moffatg the excitation of the magnetic field in the conducting environment m mir 1980 342 p 4 denisov g novikov v on the course of the liquid between the control surfaces applied mechanics and technical physics 2011 t 52 no 1 c 40 46 p a novikov kazan volga federal university novikov it kfu ru determination of the boundaries of the continuation of the locally most powerful consistent criterion is known see 1 2 that the continuation of the local consistent criterion for checking the hypo the theza h 0 0 with alternative h 1 0 about material
