into polishing in the lagrange at the extreme points of the polynomials of chebyshev the report consists of three parts in the first part the known results on the approximations of interpolation by 105 polynomials of ln ln f x n k 0 f xk lk x f c 1 1 xk cos k n 1 where lk x fundamental polynomials in extreme points of polynomials of chebyshev i kind the second part of the report will set out new results in this area to illustrate we formulate some of them let l 2 l 2 1 1 swagger space on 1 1 with the chebyshevsky weight x 1 x 2 1 2 and with the usual norm and c c 1 1 and r r 1 1 the spaces of all continuous and accordingly integrated by riman into 1 1 functions with conventional max and sups theorem 1 for any function f r 1 1 polynomials 1 converge in space l 2 if f c 1 1 then the speed of convergence can be determined by the inequality f lnf l 2 2 en f c n n 2 where e f c is the best uniform approximation of the function f c 1 1 algebraic polynomials of the degree not higher than n theorem 2 operators ln c l 2 are limited in aggregate more precisely ln l 2 n n 3 theorem 3 for any function f r 1 1 lim n 1 1 ln f x dx 1 x 2 1 1 f x dx 1 x 2 4 if f c 1 1 then for any n n the assessment 1 1 f x ln f x 1 x 2 dx 2 e 2 n 1 f are true c 5 106 condition gaussa chebyshev quadrature formula 1 1 1 x 2 f x dx n 1 n k 1 sin 2 k n 1 f cos k n 1 f c 6 is a private a case of formula 1 1 f x dx 1 x 2 1 1 ln f x dx 1 x 2 n n k 0 f xk 7 where the bar is stroke the sign of the sum means that with k 0 and k n the corresponding terms should be divided into 2 let n determined in the space l 2 1 x 2 polynomial operator of the method of oscilling functions n f x d dx ln x 0 f t dt f l 2 1 x 2 n n 8 theorem 4 operators n l 2 1 x 2 l 2 1 x 2 strongly they converge and for any n n the assessment of 1 n l 2 1 x 2 l 2 x 2 2 f nf l 2 1 x 2 2 en are true 1 f l 2 1 x 2 where en 1 f l 2 1 x 2 is the best approximation in space l 2 1 x 2 l 2 1 x 2 1 1 the functions f l 2 1 x 2 with algebraic polynomials of the degree not higher than n 1 n n in the third part of the report the applications of many gochlens 1 including theorem 1 4 to the solution of regular and singular integral equations by the methods of mechanical squares collocation and oscillitive functions will be considered 107
