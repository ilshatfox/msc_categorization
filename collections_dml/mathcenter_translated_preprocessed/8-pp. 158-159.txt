classification of quasi made riman varieties this work is devoted to the study of the behavior of solutions of the equation lu 1 x div x u c x u 0 1 where x and c x smooth positive functions on non memorial riman varieties of some special species consider the triples si d 2 i fi where i 1 k si compact rimanovo diversity without a edge d 2 i metric on si fi positive smooth function on si variety d will be called a simple crossed work of order k if d isometrically direct work r 0 inous s 1 sk with a metric ds 2 k i 1 f 2 i i dr 2 k i 1 q 2 i r j 6 i f 2 j j d 2 i diversity representable in the form of b d 1 d 2 dp where b is the compact and di are simple crossed works we will call quasi making varieties we will say that d is l stringed with a hyperbolic crossed work of order k s if for any function c s and any continuous on s function s 1 k on d there is a solution to the equation 1 such that u r 0 and limr r s 1 k we will say that d is a l hyperbolic crossed work if for any function c s and any constant c to d there is a solution to equation 1 such that u r 0 and limr r c 158 let m complete rimanovo variety represented in the form of the association m b d where b is an arbitrary not obligatory compact area and d is a simple crossed work of the order k then the following statements are fair theorem 1 let d is l stringed with a hyperbolic crossed work of order k s then for any continuous function s 1 k on m there is a solution to the equation 1 that in the region d is lim r mit u r s 1 k theorem 2 let d is a l hyperbolic crossed work then for any constant c to m there is a solution to the equation 1 that in the region d is limr u r c in addition in the work criteria for determining the type of quasi making diversity in terms of metric of diversity were found s f lukomsky saratov about the convergence of the multiple of the multiple of the walsha in spaces close to lux let n n 1 n 2 nd nd d 1 family of d somedes vectors consider the task of convergence of partial amounts of sn f n d fold of furye uolsha palei functions f in spaces close to lux depending on the properties of the family determine d s lim sup n n min k v n 1 v n 2 v nd v nk 1 v nk 2 v nks where min k is taken by all s element submarines k k 1 k 2 ks 159
