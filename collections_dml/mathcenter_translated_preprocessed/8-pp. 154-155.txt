the task of diffraction of waves on periodic structures with a deformed section proposed a method for analyzing diffraction phenomena that occur when a flat electromagnetic wave falls on a periodic grill 1 containing a limited area with other characteristics than that of the lattice an example of such structures are lattices with a partially deformed profile see 2 the mathematical model is built in the form of a non self intended regional task for the helmholtz equation with a conductor of 154 le or a neuman at the border the condition on the rib 1 in the singular points of the border and the partial condition at infinity 3 with the help of work technology 4 on the basis of the apparatus of boundary integral equations and the theory of periodic gratings the properties of generalized potentials as well as the results of work 5 the classical resolution of model regional tasks has been proved developed and on the basis of the work methodology 6 the theoretically substantiated methods of the approximate solution of the examination problems in question l and t r a t r a 1 shestopalov v p the dynamic theory of gratings kyiv naukova dumka 1989 216 p 2 cacenelenbaum b z the indignation of the electromagnetic field with small deformations of the metal surface j technology physics 1955 t xxv no 3 s 546 557 3 ilyinsky a s partial conditions of radiation and their use in electromagnetic wave theory tr matte center named after n i lobachevsky kazan kazan matte o in 2000 t 6 s 4 13 4 lipachev e k to the approximate solution of the regional task of diffraction of waves in areas with an infinite border izv universities mathematics 2001 no 4 s 69 72 5 babich v m on the theorem of the existence of a solution to the problem of a conductor and neuman for the equation of the helmholtz in a quasi aidic case sib matte g 1988 t xxix no 2 p 3 9 6 gabdulkhaev b g the optimal approximation of solutions of linear problems kazan publishing house of kazan un tee 1980 232 p p lichbersky lodz v v starkov petrozavodsk line invariant families of the ball display and flea functions in cn 155
