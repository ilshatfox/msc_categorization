some classes of representing systems and their transformations i yu f korobeynik rostov on don 1 introduction 1 let h the complete separated by the local convex space half wp with the topology set by the set of the prenature p p and let x xk ger icles 1 some sequence of its non zero elements such that the system xk nk 1 linearly independent in h 1 for any n 1 form on it the space of numerical sequences a 1 a 1 x h c ck k 1 ck c a row k 1 ckxkk converges in h if p p c a put qp c sup n 1 p n k 1 ckxk lc ger k 1 ckxk and introduce into a 1 topology a set of prenatures qp qp p matter then a 1 is half the up see for example 1 p 194 operator l c a 1 7 lc h will be a linear continuous operator from a 1 to h further it is called the performance operator 171 code x is called the representing system ps in h if any element x from h can be represented in the form of a row x ger k 1 ckxk it is obvious see for example 1 2 that x ps in h and only when l is epimorphism a 1 on h apparently for the first time the concept of ps for the case when h is the space of fre she was introduced by a a talalan 3 who called them the presentation systems each basis in h all more will be ps the opposite is not always true for example if h h g is the space of the functions of the functions in the g c field with standard topology then the system e kz k 1 for any k c will not be the basis in h g see for example 4 at the same time as shown by a f leontyev 5 and later in another way yu f the box 6 for any convex region g b c there is a sequence k k 1 complex numbers such that e kz k 1 ps in h g thus if x ps in h then the decomposition of a one element x h into a row in x is not necessarily the only one in connection with which the questions arise 1 is it possible to determine constructively the coefficients of any decomposition of the element x according to ps x for any element x from h 2 is it possible to select also x h these coefficients so that they depend on x linearly and continuously the questions posed lead to definitions 1 ps x is called effective eps if there is a method of constructive determination according to any element x from h of any decomposition into h row in the system x 2 ps x is called the correct pps if the corresponding operator of the presentation l has a linear continuous right reverse lnpo 3 ps x is called effectively correct eps if the corresponding operator of submission l has an effectively determined lnpo note that if the operator l has lnpo t then x h x k 1 tx kxk and the row converges in h since the topology in a 1 majors the topology of the passing convergence then k 1 x tx k h and the coefficients of this decomposition depend on x linearly and continuously obviously each eps will be even eps 2 recall the definition of another important class of representing systems the sequence of the x non equalous elements xk k 1 of h is called an absolutely representing system aps in half a half if any element x h is represented as a row x ger k 1 ckxk 1 172 absolutely converging in h put a 2 a 2 x h c ck k 1 q 0 p c ger k 1 ck p xk p erp erp then a 2 is also half avp 1 p 196 197 with a set of prenatures qp pion and the operator l 0 c a 2 ger k 1 ckxk h lineen and continuous from a 2 in h at the same time x aps in h then and only when l 0 is epimorphism a 2 on h since the decomposition in a row 1 does not have the property of uniqueness in a general situation the same questions arise as for ps and ps and ps definitions of effective correct and effectively correct aps with the replacement of ps with aps and l 0 subsequently designated by the symbols of the eaps paps and epaps are given 3 effective and correct ps and aps are used to build private solutions of linear functional equations consider one such example 6 let q a linear continuous operator h with a sequence of its own elements qyk kyk k c k 6 0 k 1 2 suppose that y yk k 1 ps b h and what 1 k omet 1 multiplier a 1 y h d dk ger a 1 dk k ipp 1 a 1 let f h and f ger k 1 fkyk some kind of decomposition f of ps y then as it is easy to check a row k 1 fk k yk converges in h and if y 0 is its amount then qy 0 f therefore if y ps in h h and 1 k k 1 multiplier a 1 then q is epimorphism h and the method of constructing a private solution in h for any right part f of h is indicated when y is constructive when y eps when examining such linear equations the question often arises whether q 1 r q has q lnpo it is clear that if such an q 1 r operator exists then f h the element q 1 r f is a private solution to the qy f equation depending on f and linearly and continuously we indicate fairly simple conditions that ensure the existence of lnpo q 1 r suppose that 1 k icle 1
