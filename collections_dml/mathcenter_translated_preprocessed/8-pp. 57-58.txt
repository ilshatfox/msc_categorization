some maximum theorems for measures on hyperbolic logic in this message on w ising algebra are summarized by two limit theorems proved by m s matveychuk 1 2 for the case of w j factors we adhere to the designations and terminology of work 3 theorem 1 let the pu the set of all u sample projectors from semi pointed w u algebrym without a direct component type in n 4 and let n pu r sequence of indepinite measures suppose that for any projector p pu there is the final limit p lim n n p then p 0 entails p 1 n p 0 evenly by n if in addition m is the final algebra then pu r is an indepinite measure 57 for semi traces on pu pu theorem 1 takes the following form drying 2 let in the assumptions of theorem 1 n a sequence of half traces then for any u algebras the limit function is also half a trace m s matveychuk studied the measure on the ideal of orthoprojectors the next theorem shows that for the semi ended w u algebra m the many pfu pfu pfu p pu for which the subspace p of course can serve as a hyperbolic analogue of the ideal indefinite measure pfu r will call the final if for any projector p p u p u the inequality of sup q q p q p f u theorem 3 let the semi pointedw u albur which does not have a direct component type in n 4 then any final indepinite measure pfu r continues to all logic pu to an indepinite measure the work was supported by the ministry of defense of the russian federation project e 00 1 0 172 l and t r a t r a 1 matvejchuk m s vitali hahn saks theorem for hyperbolic logics int j of theor phys 1995 v 8 no 34 p 1567 574 2 matvejchuk m s finite indefinite measure on hyperbolic logics tatra mountains math publ 1993 no 3 p 77 80 3 vladova e v the probability in space with a unitaryly generated one and a half line form real collection s k vodopyanov novosibirsk p rotation of display on carno groups in various topologies and some applications the purpose of the report is to discuss the concept of p rostomencies 58
