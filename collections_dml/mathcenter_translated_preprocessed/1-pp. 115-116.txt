rough rides in the dynamics of flexible plates when exposed to longitudinal periodic loads krysko a v mitskevich s a the saratov state technical university built the theory of rude attractors in the dynamics of flexible plates as the original equations the equations of margerra vlasov mushtari are taken the solution method the final differences in spatial to the ordinates the methods of the gauss for the system of linear algebraic equations and the runge kugg for the system of ordinary differential equations according to the variable t methods of the theory of stochastic vibrations are used in the area of the control parameters of the rx yu where rx is the intensity of the longitudinal dynamic load along the ox axis yu is its frequency areas of rude attractions are built in which three countries are identified which are localized in various areas of phase space without intersection these attrays are rude as they retain their structure and static properties with small of the menenia of the control parameters of the px and yu to analyze the stochastic fluctuations of flexible plates the following characteristics were built 1 v x y t f x y t w x y t phase portra you li and poincare of functions w f mp mx mu 12 n p n n 2 for arbitrary points of the plate plan power spectra auto correlation functions a characteristic type of display of poincare for w f mp mx mu 2 at f x 9 and a 16 px o 5 and y 17 shown in fig l b g e z the dependence of the deflection time w 0 5 0 5 1 is shown in fig ja and ld these characteristics are identical to all points of the plate plan the boundary condition is free support initial conditions and l o 0 001 sin 1 t x sin 1 t 1 i o o 115 krysko a v mitskevich s a rough rides in diiamic o x 12 l w 0 5 0 5 1 0 0000 w t t 05 0 5 0 0012 l w 0 0012 0 0012 0 0000 0 0012 w about w t o 5 o 5 0 001 o oo e 0 001 w 05 0 5 0 001 o oo 0 001 116 50 0 100 0 150 about 0 0004 f t o 5 o 5 0 0000 0 0004 v 1 f 05 0 5 0 0004 0 0000 0 0004 in 50 0 100 0 150 f t o 5 o 5 0 0004 f 0 0000 f 05 0 5 0 0004 0 0004 0 0000 0 0004 fig 0 17 a 200 0 m t o 5 o 5 0 01 r 00 0 00 0 00 0 0 0 m t o 5 o 5 0 011 3 o oo m 05 0 5 0 011 1 0 011 o oo 0 011
