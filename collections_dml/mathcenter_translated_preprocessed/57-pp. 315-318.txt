about sinc approximations of special integrals on the real axis yu s soliev with the help of sync approximations for special singular and hypersingular integrals with the cauchy kernel along the real axis quadrature formulas with nodes of different multiplicities are constructed and investigated keywords special integral sinc approximation quadrature formula udc 517 28 517 54 517 41 hypothesis on jacobian the structure of the display of keller v v starkov 1 1 vstarv list ru petrozavodsk state university hypothesis about jacobian was first formulated by keller in 1939 in a modern interpretation it involves the injection of the polynomial display f rn rn cn cn provided that ja constation ja const 0 the question is posed in this post on the structure of polynomial display f for which j f const 0 keywords hypobiana hypothesis celler display we denote through pm many polynomas in rn or cn not exceeding m let pm many polynomial display f f 1 fn rn rn or cn cn fk pm k 1 n degree degfk m we denote the jacobi matrix through df and through jf jacobian display f in a complex case df and jf complex formulated by keller 1 in 1939 the hypothesis of jacobian jc in its modern interpretation is as follows if f pm and jf const 0 then f is inexplicable in rn cn the positive decision of the hypothesis would open up the possibility of its vast application in a number of areas of mathematics in 2 the hypothesis is proved for f p 2 for any n in 3 the hypothesis is checked for n 2 and f p 100 however so far the jc has not been proven or refuted at any meaning n the hypothesis is included in the list of mathematical problems for the next century 4 in this note the question of the structure of the display f pm with jf const 0 is posed it is it that seems key to evidence or refutation of jc the solution to this issue followed by the application of criteria or sufficient conditions for the injection of the display will lead to significant progress in jc the display f pm will be called the celler display if jf 1 and his jacobi matrix df 0 i in 5 a complete description of the celler s display for n 2 m 3 theorem a 5 let f p 2 3 f 0 0 display f is the reflection of the celler and only when when f a 1 g a where g x y u x y v x y u x y x 2 x y 2 3 x y 3 316 materials of the school conference v x y y 2 x y 2 3 x y 3 2 and 3 arbitrary fixed constant a linear a homogeneous unpertured display for m 3 a lot of keller displays is already more difficult see 6 in 7 the analogue of theorem a is obtained as a sufficient condition the theorem b 7 the hypothesis of jacobian is true for polynomial display f x asis f x where x x 1 xn rn a is a linear homogeneous unpertured display f u 1 un for k 1 n uk x xk k 2 x 1 xn 2 3 x 1 xn 3 m x 1 xn m j k r with n k 1 k 0 theorem b allows the following significant generalization theorem c 7 let for n 2 display f x u 1 un rn rn is determined as follows uk x xk pk 2 x 1 xn 2 pkm x 1 xn m 1 k 1 n and pk j any constant satisfying the condition n k 1 pk j 0 for all j 2 m then jc is fair for f moreover f f 1 where fl l 1 n polynomial displays of the species f from theorem b question 1 will the statement of the theorem c remain fair if in determination 1 of coordinate functions uk x the amount z x 1 xn replace with z b 1 x 1 bn xn with an arbitrary vector b b 1 bn b 1 one the problem is solved by the selection for each display f from the theorem c of an unexpected matrix a such that f x a 1 f ax has the necessary properties it turns out that such a matrix a does not always exist theorem 1 let k 1 n and p k pk 2 pkm m 1 a dimensions not all of which are zero n k 1 p k 0 let rn b b 1 bn 1 1 f x from theorem c is determined by condition 1 by means of vectors p k 1 if in a set of vectors k k 1 n linearly independent vectors no more n 2 then there is an unexpected matrix a such that f x a 1 f ax x q 12 z 2 q 1 m z m qn 2 z 2 qnm z m n k 1 qk j 0 for j 2 m 2 where z b x 2 if among vectors p k k 1 n n 1 linearly independent then the matrix a with the property 2 does not exist question 2 how much is the condition n k 1 qk j 0 important in the theorem 1 is important so that the polynomial display f x x m j 2 q j z j where q j q 1 j qn j z b x 3 v v starkov 317 was keller s display theorem 2 for any vector b b 1 bn and any vectors j
