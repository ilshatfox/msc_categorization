new modifications of the concept of analytical capacity the concept of analytical capacity of sets plays a very pulmonary role in modern complex analysis along with the main analytical container the capacity of alfors its modifications were also used in the definitions of which the potato cyls with different types of measures were involved complex real or positive the unifying for all these concepts was used 4 limited analytical functions for the capacity of alfors it was the whole class of analytical in the field of c po c functions f z lf z i 1 f oo oh and for the above modifications subclasses of this class with the functions represented by the potentials of the cossack with certain measures in the recent preprint of the young izsky mathematician h tolsa 1 a sensational result on the equivalence of the capacity of alfors and all of it was obtained the noted modifi county in 1 an extensive bibliography of works related to the development of these concepts and their applications is also given in this lecture we will deal with the new modifications of analytical the functions that lie under the arbitrary ointment of 163 wounds in that the time as the majority unit was still with the majority literature 1 h tolsa the semiadditivity of analytic capacy prepl int 2001 p 1 39 g v khromov saratov the new idea of tikhonovsky regulators in 1 was shown that the area of convergence of the method of regulatory of a n tikhonov of the l th order of smoothness 2 can be expanded to the entire space with a b i e tikhonovskiy requirements 1 additional smoothness for the exact solution of the studied equation can be removed in this message using the example of the task of approaching periods of periods of the reerusing operators tikhonov it is expected that the indicated area of convergence can be expanded to space c 1 a b consider on the segment g 7 r l times continuously differentiated function x satisfying the conditions 1 and the family of operators rcrf argi f u flli al j where w i is the one dimensional space of sobolev a o is a parameter 164
