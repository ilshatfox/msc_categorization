small isperimetric inequalities for the euclidean moments of the region regarding the border the main result of the work is to clarify the isoperimetric inequalities from work 1 in the class of polygons with a fixed number of parties it is well known that the classic isperimetric inequality between the area of the region and its long border is specified for n squares in particular classic isperimetric inequality can be obtained by the ultimate transition a large number of classic and new small isoperimetric inequalities can be found in an article review 2 the work considers isperimetric inequalities for the new geometric functionals of the region which were 92 in connection with a bilateral assessment of physical functionality the rigidity of the region s power see 3 let g a single link area on the plane geometric functionality i g g dist z g dx dy is called the euclidean moment of the region relative to the border of the order here is dist z g the distance from the point z x iy g to the boundary of this area g and 1 the polygon is called described if each of its sides touches the circle theorem let g the described n the bang then i g i g where g is the correct n angle of the same area as g the resulting isoperimetric inequality is a direct analogue of the classical inequality of saint venan polya p g a 2 g 2 where p g is the rigidity of the single legged area g the work is supported by the rffif project no 02 01 00168 and the universities of russia program l and t r a ta 1 avkhadiev f g salahudinov r g bilateral isoperimetric inequalities for bundary moments domains lobachevskii j of mathematics 2001 v 9 p 3 5 http ljm ksu ru 2 solynin a yu isperimetric inequalities for polygons and dissimmetrization algebra and analysis 1992 t 4 issue 2 s 210 234 3 avhadiev f g solving the generalized problem of saint venan matem collection 1998 t 189 issue 12 s 3 12 93
