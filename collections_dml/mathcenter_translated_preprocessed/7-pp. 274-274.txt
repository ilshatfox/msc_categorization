some results of the numerical modeling of oil displacement with water with gel forming additives s v anokhin r kh zakirov a i nikiforov institute of mechanics and engineering of the executioners of the russian academy of sciences 420111 kazan ul lobachevsky 2131 one of the effective ways to combat a rapidly progressive on the water of the products of producing wells is the processing of the payment of gel forming systems as such a system a solution of polyacrylamide and solutions of chromium salts usually rummage chromium ions interacting with the polymer molecules form a gel deep in the layer and block the main water supply paths thereby changing the direction of filtration flows the authors of this work compiled an algorithm for solving the corresponding regional problems based on the method of final elements the numerical decision was obtained for a fragment of a heterogeneous layer the effect of the exposure to gel forming systems was evaluated by comparing the coefficient of oil extraction from the layer with the coefficient a when the oil is displaced with water without chemicals b with oil virter solution with a polymer solution on the influence of current modulation on the electrical characteristics of the flow of nonequilibrium plasma aslan osman f a salyanov institute of mechanics and engineering of the executioners of the russian academy of sciences 420111 kazan ul lobachevsky 2131 work is the development of studies of the processes of smoldering discharge tr in plasmotrons with modulated current published earlier in 1 1 shows that the non stationary regional task of the plasma flow in plasma is reduced to solving the system of non level equations for electrons and the law of oma in integral form under the production of 274
