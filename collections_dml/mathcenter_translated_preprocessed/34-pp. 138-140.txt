invariant equipment of the distribution of kartan n a kuzmina chuvash state pedagogical university cheboksary caf geom chgpu mail ru this work is devoted to the study of some issues of the diots of the cardan m in the projective about the wanderings of p 2 m in the projective space p 2 m we consider the distribution of tangent elements a 0 m the center a 0 belongs to the corresponding plane m in the first order reoper the vertices of the rapper a 0 ai are located in the corresponding plane of the distribution and the a 0 coincides with its center the system of differential equations of the distribution of m sized linear elements has the form i ik k 0 i j k k k s 1 2 m m 1 2 m i k 1 2 m it is known that the distribution of m merged linear elements is a highonomic and only when ten zor jk is symmetrical suppose that 1 the number of linearly independent quadratic asymptotic forms a ik i 0 k 0 on the distribution is equal to m a ij ij 2 the distribution of m carries fabric fabric that is the directions of tangent to the lines of the fabric m are paused in pairs relative to any cone of directions 0 140 such a distribution by analogy with the surface of the cardan will be called the distribution of kartan we attribute the repertr to the fabric we choose the vertices of the ai rapper on tangent to the lines of fabric then in the selected first order of the first order the tissue equation has the form j i ik ik k 0 where aijk aiiama ijk i 6 j definitor a def a ii 6 0 is a related invariant d ln a 3 ss m 1 00 ak k 0 ak ass a ssk definition they say that the fabric m m is a holonon if any of the equations i 0 0 is quite integrated theorem 1 if the distribution of m m mortary linear elements in the projective space p 2 m is in a head then the fabric m m is golononna theorem 2 the halon distribution of cardan which carries the m consumed fabric of smirnov with m 2 exists with arbitrariness m m 1 functions m 2 arguments we compose the 2 nd order functions q 0 i def 1 m 1 j 6 i a j ij ti def 1 3 ai m 2 q 0 i aikk def aikk with i 6 k tk with i k i def aissa ss each of the functions of q 0 i i satisfies the equations dq 0 i q 0 i 00 ii 0 i q 0 ik k 0 darti i i i i i k k 0 the functions of the 3 rd order q 0 def 1 m s s m 1 q 0 s a s their s 141 are satisfied with the equations dq 0 q 0 0 q 0 s 0 s 0 q 0 k k 0 theorem 3 the fields of quasienzors i q 0 i of the 2 nd order of the coprea divide the internal invariant normalization of the head of the cardan it should be noted that the constructed normal nm i of the first kind of kartan is one of the m parametric family of foss normals theorem 4 the field of the geometric object i q 0 of the 3 rd order determines the internal invariant equipment in the sense of the e cardan of the codan of the cardan m p 2 m some results about the separation of the separation of medvedev a v kulakov kazan state university antonk 83 mail ru determination 1 any class a everywhere certain functions is called a mass problem let a and b are massive problems then a 6 m b and only when there is a calculated functionality such that g b f a grap f graph g determination 2 denote through sa b r a r b r 142
