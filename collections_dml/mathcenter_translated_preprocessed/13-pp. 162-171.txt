the method of potential functions in the dynamic tasks of the elastic theory of 1 a a gusenkova kazan state university considers the method of potential functions to solve the problems of diffraction of the elastic harmonic wave on a defect located along the segment of the material axis in a homogeneous isotropic environment some generalizations of the method in case of anisotropic three dimensional dynamic task of the theory of elasticity are proposed 1 three dimensional task in the case of anisotropic environment will consider the harmonic vibrations of the elastic homogeneous anisotropic semi space x 3 0 in the absence of volumetric forces as you know 1 in this case the dynamic equations in movements recorded in a fixed rectangular cartesian coordinate system x x 1 x 2 x 3 have the form 3 k l j 1 cijkl 2 uk xl xj 2 ui 0 i 1 3 1 1 work was supported by the fund of r d of the republic of tatarstan 162 a a gusenkova where is x t re u x e i t 1 2 3 vector vector u u 1 u 2 u 3 complex movement vector density density wednesdays cijkl i j k l 1 3 elastic constant satisfying the ratios cijkl cjikl cklij solution u u 1 u 2 u 3 equations 1 at x 3 0 x 3 0 will be called leaving the plane x 3 0 to the semi space x 3 0 x 3 0 if 1 ui x 1 x 2 x 3 i 1 3 supp ui x 1 x 2 x 3 x 3 0 x 3 0 i 1 3 2 a 2 sing supp ui 2 3 0 3 0 i 1 3 2 b we will look for the solution of the equation 1 x 3 x 3 0 in the classes leaving the plane x 3 0 in the semi space x 3 0 satisfying the conditions 3 j 1 ij ui xj x 1 x 2 0 g i x 1 x 2 ui x 1 x 2 0 h i x 1 x 2 xi r i 1 3 3 where gi hi specified functions ij some constant we apply to equations 1 the conversion of fourier according to variables x 1 x 2 x 3 taking into account the conditions 2 a and using the boundary conditions 3 then the images of the fourier of the distributions ui x 1 x 2 x 3 i 1 3 satisfy the equations 3 k l j 1 cijkl supply 2 ui 1 fi 1 2 3 i 1 3 4 where fi 1 perforate lection i ed 3 k 1 2 j 1 cijk 3 ci 3 kj ju 0 k 2 ci 3 k 3 iu 1 k 1 3 u 0 k 2 163 method of potential functions in dynamic tasks i 1 3 u 0 k 1 2 u 1 k 2 k 1 3 images of fourier of functions ui x 1 x 2 0 ui x 3 x 1 x 2 0 i 1 3 determined from the boundary conditions 3 after the conversion of fourier according to alternating x 1 x 2 for convenience we rewrite the system of equations 4 in the form of au f and denote 1 lection perforate deta i cil 1 nut 2 i 1 3 the determinant of the matrix obtained from a replacement ith column on f 1 f 2 f 3 t it can be shown that with im 1 im 2 im 0 the equation 0 has k pairs of comprehensive consolidated and 6 2 k actual roots j 1 6 k 0 k 0 3 the images of the fourier of the desired distributions that satisfy the conditions 2 a 2 b are determined by the equations of ui 2 i 1 2 3 i 1 3 moreover i 1 2 3 0 i 1 3 3 cil j 3 im j 3 0 j 1 k therefore we have 3 k additional conditions in the case of k roots 3 with a positive imaginary part of the equation 0 and in the boundary conditions 3 15 3 k of independent coefficients remain thus depending on the number of roots of the lection 3 0 with a positive imaginary part the number of additional conditions in the regional tasks may be different in 2 when solving the edge problem p d u f x xn 0 n 3 with conditions bj d u gj x xn 0 j 1 where x x 1 xn p hole is a homogeneous elliptical polin of order m the number of boundary conditions coincides with the number of roots equation p 0 cil 1 mit 1 in which the imaginary part is positive it is assumed that the order of the differential operator bj d does not exceed m 1 note that the difference between our approach from the method considered in 2 is that in 2 164 a a gusenkova transformation of fourier therefore the number of boundary conditions in 2 recorded for the desired function corresponds to the number of our additional conditions recorded for the images of fourier of the desired function the boundary conditions 3 in variables x 1 x 2 x 3 can be considered an analogue of the condition of lopatinsky in variables 1 cil in both cases these conditions ensure the correctness of the task for example if in boundary conditions 3 there will be fewer coefficients then the task may be redundant note that the division of conditions into boundary and additional condition of lopatinsky and boundary is made exclusively for convenience and simplification of calculations they can be naturally combined by moving to alternating x 1 x 2 x 3 x 1 xn or to alternating cil 1 cil 2 oring cil 1 cil these conditions impose some restrictions on the coefficients ij h i gi i j 1 3 operators bj d j 1 b 2
