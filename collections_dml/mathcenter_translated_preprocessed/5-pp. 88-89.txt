the limitations of nonlinear integrated operas and the tori volterr a is known 1 that if the uryson integral operator t j k t s x s ds ri acts in the space of lp rl 1 p oo and is limited on some ball then it will be limited on any ball about the wanderings of lp l in case of proof of this statement the essential role is played by the properties of the spaces of lp 1 at 1 p 88 os the space l 00 p does not have these properties nevertheless the statement of the limited integral operator in some cases turned out to be fair for the space of l 00 p in this note the corresponding approval is considered for integrated operators of bolterra and the space of the armed forces a oo continuous analogue of space l 00 a oo we denote through the m class of nonlinear integrated opera opera operating in the space of the armed forces a oo and having the form t kx t k t s x s ds and where is the function k t s 0 is continuous at a s t oo e o oo we note that each operator is continuously limited to dissection almost everywhere theorem every operator k e m limited find on a certain ball of space of the armed forces a oo will be fraud on the ryn bom wape of this space at the same time the operator is the only way to grow up on the space l 00 a oo with a conviction of the continuation of the om is a carrier the i the spaces in the spaces of the summered funv iy m nauka 1966 v v ivanov yoshkar ola to the question of the wave character of one reaction of burning the burning of the moving fuel mixture describes the system of equations 1 1 1 1 1 89
