the extrapolation description of the martsinkevich spaces and the convergence of the orthogonal series k v lykov samara university work is a continuation of research 1 4 and is devoted to the applications of the theory of extrapolation some classes of symmetrical spaces are considered on 0 1 the norm in which is determined by lp norms let f banakhovo ideal space of functions defined on 1 then you can consider the set of lf all functions x t for which cil lection p x p f it is easy to show that this is a set with the usual identification of functions equal to almost everywhere becomes a symmetrical space if we determine the norm x lf f in it if w w p is a positive function on 1 least then through f w we will denote the space of the functions x x t with the norm x f w x w f theorem 1 let m the space of the marcinkevich with the fundamental function t m 0 gment its separatic part t t gment t then the following conditions are equivalent 91 1 m lf for some f 2 m gment lf where firon lday 1 accord 3 m 0 gment lf 1 for some f 1 4 m 0 lf 0 where f ng 0 c 0 1 accord c 0 the space of functions x t of lux such that limt ger x t 0 5 there is c 0 that t c the p 1 t 1 p phone 0 t 1 1 if t satisfies stronger more stronger than 1 condition t icle t 2 2 then see 1 c 1 ship 2 p c 1 accord and therefore m 0 gment lg accord 3 where gwor 0 c 0 onic 2 p theorem 2 let e lf and the system xn 1 is minimal and full in e then if for all x e and natural n n n 1 x n x xn p cp x p where x n is a system related to xn then for any x e icle n 1 x n x xn converges to x in space e 1 lf 1 cp 92 using theorem 2 and ratio 3 can be obtained for example the following statement the investigation 1 let u satisfy the condition 2 n t gern 1 an orthonomated system and for x m 0 and natural n n n 1 cn x n p cp x p where cn x is the factors of fourier function x t if n t is full of m 0 gment then for x m 0 a row icle 1 cn x n converges x in space m 0 1 where 1 t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t ln 2 t the condition of the investigation is satisfied in particular the trigonometric system and the walsha system similar statements take place for the spaces of lorentz close results for the spaces of lorentz are proved in the work 5 l and t r a t raltakin s v lykov k v extrapolation description of the spaces of lorenz and martsinkevich close to licles in print 2 astashkin s v new extrapolation ratios in the lp space scale function analysis and its adj 2003 t 37 no 3 c 73 77 3 astashkin c v on the extrapolation properties of the lp space scale matem sat 2003 t 194 no 6 c 23 42 4 astashkin s v extrapolation function on the family of scales generated by the material interpolation method sib matte g 2005 t 46 no 2 c 264 289 5 lukomskii s f convergence of fourier series in lorentz spaces east j approx 2003 v 9 no 2 p 229 238 93
