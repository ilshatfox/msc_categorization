the task of building a profile streamlined with a feature of o s dunaev nimm named after n g chebotareva kazan state university oneberova yandex ru in the tasks of aerohydrodynamics some interest in the flow of wing profiles in the presence of features of the type of source and vortex in the stream the task of constructing a wing profile in the presence of features of the type of vortex in the stream is solved by m t nugin 1 16 the whirlwind was used in order to replace the dick or click this approach allowed to find an analytical solution to the problem and derive the conditions for its resolution but the issue of fulfilling the conditions for resolving the task that is the isolation of the desired contour of the profile and the coincidence of the given speed the flooding flow with the value found in the solution process remained open with the use of the quasi extension method the task of constructing a profile with a click replaced by a single motionlessly fixed vortex was solved in the work 2 this work is devoted to solving the reverse edge problem of aerohydrodynamics in the presence of a vortex of nickname in private cases of which are a source and a whirlwind 82 set the speed distribution obtained from the distribution of speed by the plate by replacing an infinite value by which is the matter a condition for the impermeability of the circuit is imposed it requires to find the shape of the wing profile and calculate its aerodi namic characteristics in the event that the resulting end of the profile is open the kva kva method is used 3 in the work an analytical solution was obtained a gram was drawn up numerical calculations were made wing profiles have been built their aerodynamic characteristics are calculated private cases of the source runoff whirlwind are considered there are conclusions about the influence of the features in the stream on the shape and aerial characteristics of wing profiles i express my gratitude to the scientific leader of professi soru nb ilyinsky for useful tips the work was carried out with the support of the rffif project 05 08 01153 l and tr t r a 1 tumashev g g juzhin m t reverse edge tasks and their applications kazan publishing house kazan university 1965 333 p 2 ilyinsky n b potashev a v building a wing profile with a closing simulated point vortex izv ras mechanics of liquid and gas 1992 no 1 p 3 9 3 elizarov a m ilyinsky n b potashev a v reverse edge tasks of aerohydrodynamics m science 1994 440 p 83
