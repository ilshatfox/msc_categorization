the correction theorem for helder s space considers the classic task of correcting the function from the gelder space to many low measures to increase its smoothness of the previous works on this 40 matics we note 1 in which it is shown that many functions x c 0 1 are such that m t x t y t 0 for all functions from the fixed space of helder has the second category in c 0 1 in 2 an example of a function from h 0 1 is given that m t x t y t 0 for each function from hool with 1 let is the first order continuity module h the corresponding space of the helder of the functions on 0 1 definition we will say that the function x h is correctable if there is a measurable set of mx positive measures such that lim s t s tgrmx x t x s t s 0 theorem 1 there is such an infinite closed subspace b of space h which each is not correct from identical zero is not corrective the theorem 2 the set of corrective functions in h is many the first category the work was supported by the russian federation project 99 01 00355 l and t r a 1 goffman c approximation of non parametric surfaces of finite area j math mech 1963 v 12 p 737 745 2 mikheev i m one property of functions represented by la kunar rows fourier vestnik mosk un of mat mech 1972 no 5 c 67 71 m s bespalov vladimir constant labig for walsh system for the constant of the walsha fayn system set 1 re 41
