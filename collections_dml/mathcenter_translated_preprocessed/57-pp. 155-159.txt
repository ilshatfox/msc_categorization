conditions for weak compactness of sets of bounded radon measures on various topological spaces v k zakharov t v rodionov the paper presents some cb weak compactness criterion of a set of positive bounded radon measures for a tychonoff space similar to the well known prokhorov criterion since for a general hausdorff space the classical space cb of bounded continuous functions can be trivial and not separate points and closed sets the s weak compactness criterion is presented for this case where s is the new uniformly closed linear space of metasemicontinuous functions these results are esentially based on the solution of the riesz radon frechet problem of characterization of radon integrals as linear functionals obtained by the authors earlier keywords radon measure prokhorov property uniform tightness weak compactness riesz representation theorem udc 517 13 510 67 some inductive sequence of models of generalized second order dedekind theory of real numbers with exponentially increasing powers v k zakharov 1 t v rodionov 2 1 valeriy zakharov list ru lomonosov moscow state university 2 rodionovtv mail ru lomonosov moscow state university the paper is devoted to construction of some inductive sequence of models of the generalized second order dedekind theory of real numbers with exponentially increasing powers these models are not isomorphic whereas all models of the standard second order dedekind theory are the main idea in passing to generalized models is to consider instead of superstructures with the single common set theoretical equality and the single common set theoretical belonging superstructures with several generalized equalities and several generalized belongings for first and second orders the basic tools for the presented construction are the infraproduct of collection of mathematical systems different from the factorized lo ultraproduct and the corresponding generalized infrafiltration theorem keywords second order language generalized models infraproduct ultraproduct nonstandard analysis 156 1 introduction it is well known that all standard models of the standard second order dedekind theory of real numbers are isomorphic see for example 1 7 2 the paper is devoted to the exposition of some generalized second order dedekind theory of real numbers with non isomorphic generalized models more precisely the paper is devoted to construction of some inductive sequence r ei 1 i 0 of models of the generalized second order dedekind theory of real numbers with exponentially increasing powers since the sequence r ei 1 i 0 is non limit see part i of the theorem in section 3 some limit generalized model r e 0 is constructed such that every r ei is a submodel of r e 0 see part ii of the theorem these generalized models are completely different from models of the non standard first order nondedekind theory of real numbers presented in 2 2 14 under the name of non standard analysis the appropriate for these constructions second order notions were introduced in papers 4 6 see also 5 c 1 c 2 namely a generalized second order signature g 2 a generalized language l g 2 of the signature g 2 a superstructure s g 2 of the signature g 2 over a set a an interpretation amathematical system u a sg 2 of the signature g 2 on the sup port a an evaluation on the systemu of all variables of the signature g 2 and a generalized modelu for a set of formulas of the language l g 2 the main idea in passing to generalized models is to refuse the consideration of superstructures with the single common set theoretical equality and with the single common set theoretical belonging and to consider the superstructure sg 2 with several generalized equalities first and second and several generalized belongings first and second for first and second orders this generalized superstructure sg 2 is the derivative object from some initial generalized second order signature g 2 containing in addition to individual and predicative constants and variables some symbols of generalized equalities and some symbols of generalized belongings for first order types and second order types 0 k correspondingly in the capacity of initial formulas of the language l g 2 the formulas of the following two forms are taken the formula y z and the formula x 00 x k k u where y and z are the variables of the first or the second order type and x i i and u are the variables of the first order types i and the second order type 0 k respectively these atomic formulas are interpreted on an evaluated system u with an evaluation of variables on u in the following generalized way y z and x 00 x k k u where is a generalized ratio of equality and is a generalized ratio
