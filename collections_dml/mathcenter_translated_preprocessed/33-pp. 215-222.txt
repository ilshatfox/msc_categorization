a numerical study of the spectral task associated with lbb resistance to schemes for the task of stox i v fedorov moscow state university named after m v lomonosov moscow consideration of many tasks of hydrodynamics leads to the regional task of stake strong grad p f in div u 0 in u 0 on 1 where is limited coherent area f f 1 x y f 2 x y a given vector function u v x y w x y an unknown vector function corresponding to speed p p x y a scalar function corresponding to pressure for unambiguousness p is assumed p d 0 this system is a stationary simplification of the problem of nastye stox which simulates laminar hydrodynamic currents in case of currents with low speeds resolving issues 1 and regularity of decisions are lit in 3 a numerical analysis of this task involves sampling by spatial variables that is the transition in the final spaces of uh and ph in this case an important characteristic of the 215 numerical study of the spectral task the final spaces used are the implementation for them inf sup inequality the existence of such h that sup uhorn ph div uh uh u h ph p ph ph 2 where u u gradu gradu 1 2 p p p 1 2 canne d the expression 2 is called the lbb consequences or inequality of ladyzhenskaya grandmother bretzi its implementation i e the existence of the grid dependent lower border for h guarantees the existence and unity of the solution of the discrete analogue of the problem of stox as well as its stability 6 therefore a large number of works are devoted to the search for lbb resistant ultimately ultimately ultrasound spaces see 4 and a reference book 7 a discrete analogue of a generalized task can be rewritten in a matrix form a b bt 0 u p f 0 3 where u p f are coefficient vectors obtained by the decompositions of the corresponding functions according to the bases of spaces uh and ph a at 0 the grid analogue of the laplass operator b is an analogue of grad bt the grid analogue of div then inf sup inequality is equivalent see 4 uniform limited limit from the bottom of the younger non mound value of the schuru schuru schuru operator sh 0 b ta 11 b system 3 because 2 p cp 6 p sh 0 p p rnp thus the task of finding the lbb constructs is reduced to the spectral problem au bp 0 btu p 4 for the pressure operator s 0 of the classical problem of stox 1 in 4 asymptotics of the size for areas rectangular shape the assessment on top for flat areas of the type of curved polygons and it is shown that the own functions of the operator s 0 they have features in the corners of the region 216 i v fedorov and the equation for the indicator of these features is also displayed estimates for the regions of the ring and cylindrical shape are presented in this paper numerical estimates of lbb controls were obtained on the triangular area given by the ratio a of the two sides and the angle between them to sampling the task the method of finite elements with a piece of speed is used continuously on and pressure piece to standing in uh u u s 1 th 2 u c c u 0 on ph p p const th p d 0 here th triangulation with step h obtained by the sequential breakdown of the triangle with medium lines th 2 triangles with sides doubled discrete analogues of operators div grad were built the circulation of the laplass operator was carried out using the blas package 12 with the front method for sparse matrices 5 to solve the edge problem of stake the method of uzhavas of conjugated gradients was used 8 the substantiation of the correctness of the construction of operators and the implementation of algorithms was carried out in particular the method of conjugated gradients made it possible to solve the edge problem of stox for non non oidal speed functions and you can check the convergence of the numerical solution of uh to the projection to the mesh of the analytical solution of u at the speed o h 2 2 to solve the spectral problem 4 namely the assessment of the five younger own values and the corresponding own vectors used the lantzosha method implemented in the arpack program package 10 11 it is known that the spectrum of the operator s 0 div discrete and limited s 0 c 1 0 c 6 1 2 see study of the spectrum of the mossera in 1 and lemma 1 of 9 from 9 at the same time 1 is an isolated own value of endless multiplicity the presence of a complete orthonomated in the p medical system of own functions is also proved 217 numerical study of the spectral task 1 a 1 3 3 h 2 3 4 5 1 8 0 282240 0 282240 0 376632 0 728994 1 16 0 247014 0 247014 0 292462 0 518270 1 32 0 227434 0 227434 0 254245 0 411297 1 64 0 215037 0 215037 0 232564 0 349831 2 a 1 2 4 h 2 3 4 5 1 8 0 197699 0 256224 0 500844 0 576776 1 16 0 164628 0 196640 0 369036 0 423263 1 32 0 146202 0 166052 0 281546 0 334037 1 64 0 134621 0 147849
