convex conformal display and right wing to the operator of representing the exhibits in this work in the present work solve the task of the existence of a linear continuous right wing operator to the operator of representing the exhibits of functions analytical on some limited convex set q in c it is assumed that q has a fundamental sequence of the surroundings consisting of convex areas in particular q can be a area or compact previously a similar task for limited convex regions q in c was solved in 1 3 and for limited convex sets q which have a fundamental sequence of compact subsets in 4 1 the geometric characterization of convex sets with a counting basis from convex surroundings further q is a limited convex set in c with a non stately insides containing 0 let d q the family of all open environs q and a q the space of all sprouts of functions analytical on q then a q g d q a g where a g is the freter space of all the functions in g b q in the standard way we introduce the inductive limit of inductive invent q a g following 5 we use the definition 1 let d convex set in c d close d in c is the intersection of the relative border d c d the set of d is strictly convex into r if the intersection of any supporting line to d c d is compact let q q part of the border q contained in q 0 q below are the sets of q such that in d q there is an account consisting of convex areas the characterization of the sets of q with this property is established in conjunction with i v pilipenko we believe b r z c z r c r 0 theorem 1 the following statements are equivalent i d q has an accounting basis consisting of convex areas ii is closed and the set q 0 int 0 is strictly convex in r 0 proof i ii since the family of all open steeps d q has a counting basis due to 6 6 6 theorem 1 a lot of 213 is closed suppose q 0 is not strictly convex in r 0 then there is an interval z 1 z 2 contained in 0 such that its end z 2 does not belong 0 which means that it lies in let l the supporting line to q containing z 1 z 2 p is an open half plate with the border l not containing q take any closed half year the transverse limited side m which lies on the interval z 1 z 2 and the boundary perpendicular to m rays lie in p l the addition of this strip is the open surroundings of q but obviously does not contain a single convex surroundings q the contradiction has been obtained so q 0 is strictly convex in r 0 ii i put qn conv n int q n n where conv d is the convex membrane of the set d n b 0 1 n n n show that qn n n the counting basis in d q it is clear that qn n n the surroundings of q suppose that qn n n is not a basis in d q then there is an open surroundings g of set q such that for any n n there is wn qn g for some tn 0 1 xn n yn intt q there are representations wn tnxn 1 tn yn n n due to the limitations of sequences tn xn yn n n we can assume that they converge tn t 0 1 xn x yn y n then wn w since the set is compact x since wn g n n compact is contained in g there is 0 for which dist wn n n therefore dist w thus w and t 1 since wn g n n then w ernt q in addition y q indeed y q if y int q then for sufficiently large n after all 0 6 t 1 is also wn int q which cannot be due to wn g for all n n since y since y since y since q x w y x and w ser int therefore if w 6 y a contradiction has been obtained with a strict bulge of q 0 in r 0 if w y then wn int q for quite large n although this is not so this means qn norn the counting basis of the surroundings q 2 the spaces of sequences operator of the presentation everywhere further it is assumed that there is a counting basis qn n the surroundings q consisting of convex limited areas moreover qn 1 qn n n for a convex set d through hd we denote the support function d hd z sup t photo re zt t c let hn hqn n n eon z exp z z c we fix the sequence j jorn in c such as j j urb through 1 q we denote the vector space of all numerical sequences c cj jorn for which a series jorn cje j absolutely converges into a q 214 for n m n we introduce banakh space of the numerical sequences n m q c cj jorn c pn m c jorn cj exp hn j j m imes lemma 1 let lim j ger log j j 0 then 1 q norn morn n m q proof according to 7 chap iii lemma 2 p 108 for any n n we have 1 qn morn n m q if a series jorn cje j absolutely converges in some about the wanderings a qn then it is abs
