the choice of a partial unavated scheme for the non stationary equation of convection disjuisation with the dominant process 1 o a lapshina rostov state university rostov on don in the work considers the non stationary equation of convection of disfusion in the incompetent environment u t 1 pe u 1 2 v 1 u x v 2 u y x v 1 u v 1 u v 1 u v 1 u v 1 u y v 2 u f 1 div v 0 x y 0 1 0 1 f f x y t v v 1 v 2 with the initial u x y 0 u 0 x y 2 and boundary conditions u x y t 0 3 the first term in equation 1 corresponds to the dynamics of the task the second term diffusion transfer and the rest convective it should be noted that the condition of inconsistency allowed us to record the original equation in the so called symmetric form when solving the problem of convection dipping it is important to know which of the processes prevails convective or diffusion to evaluate this the number of peckla which appears during the removal of the equation with pe 1 we have a process with the dominance of diffusion and with pe 1 convection dominates during the approximation of the problem 1 3 the endless method with the central differences for the first derivatives was used which has the second order of approximation in space 1 2 note that the recording of the convection disengage equation 1 work was performed with financial support for the rffi project n 00 01 00011 186 o a lapshina in symmetrical form with central strife approximation allows us to maintain the basic properties of the differential operator of convection of this equation and guarantees the receipt of a dissipative matrix 4 after the approximation of the spatial derivatives equations 1 3 on the standard five point template we get bh un 1 un ahun fn 4 here bh ah linear operators in the endless calbert space having the form bh e 1 dh 2 c 0 h ah c 0 h dh 5 as you know 3 the scheme stable according to the initial data fn 0 is stable on the right side therefore we examine stability according to the initial data the most general assessment of stability was obtained by information 4 5 to a three layer operator growth scheme with self consolidated operators and the study of the latter based on the known results about the stability of three layer circuits 1 2 in relation to the task 4 5 in 6 the following most general result was obtained theorem 1 6 if the condition is 2 dh 2 2 1 c 20 h 2 1 1 d 2 h 1 2 1 dhc 0 h c 0 hdh 0 6 scheme 3 4 stable according to initial data in a particular case when 1 0 2 1 we get a partially navigable scheme in which the convection operator is taken from the upper temporary layer i e on each layer we solve the problem e c 0 h un 1 fn e dh un 7 statement of stability for this case can be carried out by energy inequalities we formulate this condition 187 choosing a partial unexpected scheme for a non stationary equation theorem 2 let the condition 2 dh e 8 then a homogeneous fn 0 scheme 4 5 1 0 2 1 is stable proof scablarbly multiply 7 by un 1 taking into account that fn 0 un 1 2 c 0 hun 1 un 1 e dh un un 1 we will use the roe densimetricity operator c 0 h and condition ax y a x y we get un 1 2 e dh un un 1 un 1 e d un so for the stability of the circuit you need to fulfill the condition e dh 1 given the self strengthening of the operator dh it is equivalent to the following e e dh e 0 dh 2 e this follows the desired assessment 8 stability for the scheme 4 5 the theorem has been proven i must say that the assessment 6 is more common for the task 4 5 and boils down to 8 if put in 6 1 0 2 1 indeed 2 dh c 20 h d 2 h 0 2 dh d 2 h c 20 h dh 2 e dh c 20 h using the krosomitriction of operator c 0 h it can be proved that c 20 h 0 we will use this dh 2 e dh 0 188 o a lapshina given the positive certainty of the dh operator we have 2 e dh 0 and this is the assessment 8 however for receiving 6 more bulky calculations were needed while the conclusion of the condition 8 for our particular case demanded much less effort in the case when convective terms are taken from the previous temporary layer i e 1 1 2 0 we get another partial unhanged scheme in which only a symmetrical diffusion operator is made upstairs the condition of stability for this case takes the following form theorem 3 2 for the scheme 4 5 1 1 2 0 the assessment is correct un 1 d 1 m 2 4 un d where m 2 is a value that depends on the speed vector and its first derivatives to show the effectiveness of the use of partial unavated schemes for the non stationary equation of convection diplower the results were compared with the results of the use of a classic implicit scheme four tasks were tested the coefficients of the speed vectors of which are given in table 1 all of them are determined in the
