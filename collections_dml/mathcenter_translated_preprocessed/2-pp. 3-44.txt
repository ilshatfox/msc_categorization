effective algorithms for solving tough elliptical problems with large parameters 1 considere of of the end element approximation and iterative algorithms for solving a rigid elliptical regional problem with large parameters with an older derivative the rate of convergence of algorithms does not depend on the spread of the coefficients and the sampling parameter 1 introduction let d rn n 2 a limited area with a lipshit border let d g g and g the lipshitsev surface of the contact between the sets g and which are associations of the final number of topologically separated lipshit areas g i and j g mg i 1 g i m j 1 j g i g j i j for i 6 j we will also call the sets of g and areas and areas g i and j their components consider the following task of the conductor in d div a x u f in d u 0 on 1 1 where n n matrix a is represented in the form of a x a 1 x x a 2 x 1 2 a 1 and a 2 n n matrix x 1 x g j x j 1 3 1 work was carried out with the support of the rffif the project n 99 01 01146 3 here parameters 1 j j 1 2 m matrix ai x i 1 2 are symmetrical ai c 1 d where d d and there are constant i 0 i 0 such that the condition is i organiz 2 ai x lection i 2 1 4 is made for all x d and for all vectors rn further we assume that 2 1 the task 1 1 was previously investigated in the differential case for a 1 a single matrix j j 1 m and a 2 x const in 1 2 a asymmetric algorithm of the solution was built with the speed of convergence independent of in 3 this method was symmetrized and in 4 and in 5 for respectively asymmetric and symmetrical algorithms the restriction of a 2 x const was removed algorithms are based on the idea of iterations in the subspace see review in 6 for another approach to the problem see 7 let s say a few words about the structure of this work 2 introduces triangulation of the areas in question the necessary end element spaces are introduced in 3 and their basic properties are considered in 4 an approximation of the problem 1 1 is built obtained by the simplest method of final elements using linear elements to solve the final element analogue the problems 1 1 proves existence unity continuous dependence on the right side and convergence to the exact solution for all parameters j and the step of the mesh h in 5 an iterative algorithm g m kobelkova 4 finding a solution to the end element analogue of the problem 1 1 to analyze this algorithm the w queck approach was used 55 this algorithm is asymmetric and it is impossible for it to automatically choose iterative parameters the next 3 sections are devoted to the methods of correcting this deficiency in 6 symmetrization of the algorithm g m kobelkova based on the idea of j h bramble and j e pasciak 9 in 7 following the work of yu ilyash t rossi j toivanen 10 the method of minimal ita of lancosh is used to organize the process and the selection of iterative parameters in 8 symmetrization of the algorithm g m kobelkova based on the idea of n s bakhlavov g m kobelkova e v chizhonkova 3 compared to symmetrization of 6 the dimension of the task decreases by excluding the unknown u but at each step of the algorithm the laplace operator has to be converted if for the latter there is only a certain pre conditioning then such an iterative process will be two stage in 8 for a special case of the so called adaptive grid ways to overcome this problem are demonstrated the rate of convergence of all constructed algorithms does not depend on the parameters j 1 urb and the step of the grid h for the convenience of presenting evidence of all statements they are collected in a separate section 9 2 the triangulation of areas let x 1 x n means n quasi aisively arranged points on and x n 1 x 1 and all points of intersection of curves and if any are included in many storage x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x j n j 1 let dh a polygonal area with the peaks x 1 x n and h its border here h denotes the length of the smaller rib n n h the number of boundary ribs denote g g perhaps one of these curves is an empty set also designate what cuts x 1 g x n g g points from the set x j n j 1 belonging to the curve g and through x 1 x n points from the set x j n j 1 belonging to the curve the dots from the set x j g n gj 1 form broken gh from the set x j n j 1 broken h let x 1 x n means n quasi aisively arranged points on and the length of the largest rib is not more than h and all points of the intersection of curves and if any are among x x n j one let gh a polygonal area with the peaks x 1 x n x 1 g x n g g and h g
