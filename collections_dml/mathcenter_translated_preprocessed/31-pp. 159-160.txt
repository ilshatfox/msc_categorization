a mixed reverse edge task on riman surfaces with branches of branching of i z faizov kazan state university fiz hitv ru mixed reverse edge task is to find the region with a partially unknown border and the analytical function in it according to the given boundary conditions v n monakhov 1 first gave the setting of a mixed reverse edge task relative to the parameter x he studied the resolution of the problem for areas with a polygonal known border and then approximation for arbitrary hidden boundaries c r nasirov 2 studied the resolution of the regional task on riman surfaces with an arbitrary border without branches of branching in this paper we consider the case when the unknown multi leafy area dz in the plane z rimanova surface contains branching points and the known part of its border is polygonal it is assumed that dz is a single legged zordanov region on a polygonal riman surface containing a horizontal half year and contains inside the branching points zj 0 j 1 p its border lz consists of a well known arc l 1 z and the desired arc l 2 z while l 1 z is a broken with the peaks zk xk iyk k 1 n and l 2 z is such that any straight line is 160
