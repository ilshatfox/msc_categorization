the use of integral equations to the construction of riemann functions in 1 2 using integral equations some functions of riemann are built in this message these results are summarized for cases of less restrictive assumptions regarding the coefficients of the initial differential equations for example in 1 the specified issue is resolved for the uxy aux buy cu 0 equation when a a 1 y x b b 1 x const now it is shown that for a a x y b b x y the identity of ax by a similar generalization takes place for an equation with three independent variables in a flat case reasoning can be extended to the elliptical equation uxx uyy aux buy cu 0 with analytical material coefficients here the identity of ax by should be replaced by ay bx if at the same time the ln function ax by a 2 b 2 2 c is harmonic then you can build an analytical function z z x iy with which the function of the riemann is recorded in the form of j 0 z t perf d exp z t a t d z t b z dial here a z z 1 4 a z z 2 z z 2 i ib z z 2 z z 2 i b z z from a z z only by the sign before the second component j 0 the function of bessel l and t r a t r a 1 zelgalov v i kotukhov m p on the integral equi for the function of riman izv universities mathematics 1998 no 1 p 26 30 2 zhegalov v i on the three dimensional function of riman sib matte magazine 1997 t 38 no 5 s 1074 1079 108
