polokal group alebra let r kg a semi coloking group algebra over an algebraically closed field we will denote the ring ring ring ring ran ran radical to the group relative to multiplication g g j kg g g and the homomorphism of groups g g it is clear that is epimorphism if the orders g g are not equal to zero in k then is an attachment with chck 0 using bernside theorem of the limb of course of course 58 generated periodic linear group we get in another way a known result see for example 1 about the local limb of the group g l i 1 okninski j spectrally finite and semilocal group rings commun algebra 1980 v 8 p 533 541 d s permyakov nizhny novgorod dpermyakov rambler ru differentiation of classic algebrics lee over the field of characteristics 2 in the work describes the differentiation of classical algebrics lee over the field of characteristics 2 for a simple algebra of the field of characteristics 0 any differentiation is internal under the classic algebra lee above the field of non equal characteristics we understand the algebra of whether a simple algebraic group or its factor algebra in the center classic algebras of the type an bn cn dn above the field characteristics 2 their properties are largely different from the properties of the corresponding algebra over the field characteristics 0 in particular external differentiations appear in the work the dimensions of the spaces of external differentiations of all the algebra considered were found and the databases of these spaces were built theorem 1 let l algebra type an above the field f characteristics 2 n 1 l factor algebra l in the center if n 1 then dim h 1 l dim h 1 l l 4 if n 3 then dim h 1 l 1 dim h 1 l 7 if n is even then h 1 l l h 1 l l 0 if n 3 is odd then dim h 1 l l dim h 1 l 1 theorem 2 let l algebra type bn above the field f characteristics 2 n 2 l factor algebra l in the center if n 2 then dim h 1 l 5 dim h 1 l l 6 if n 3 then dim h 1 l 1 dim h 1 l 16 59
