the task of diffraction of the elastic wave on the periodic system of defects e a osipov kazan state university osipove mail ru is considered a medium consisting of two half fruits having the same environmental parameters and stripes with other characteristics on the boundary of the conjugation of the strip with the lower half fluidity of y h there are defects for example cracks or hard inclusions it is assumed that defects are posted periodically in a flat or two dimensional case when the desired values by the z the state of the elastic body describe the stress and movement which depend on the two spatial coordinates x y and on time t dependence on the time of all the values under consideration has the type of e t where is the circular frequency of the wave vibrations in the study of the tasks of the diffraction of elastic waves on the periods of wild defects in the layered environment the method of a redundant boundary task of koshi was used 1 the force of the structure of the structure of the solution of auxiliary boundary problems in each layer of the environment was considered as a quasi violent functions waves of the flock of the species f x y eiefa n mber fn y e i 2 l nx where l is the period therefore the system of differential equations is reduced to the system of equations regarding their fourier coefficients for the coefficients of the decays of the signs of the llame equation the system of differential 175 of the second order equations of the type 2 d 2 nuxn idnu yn 0 2 u was obtained yn d 2 nuyn 2 uyn idnu xn 0 the conditions of interfaces on the boundaries of the media are led to a paired functional equation it is shown that it is tantamount to bsrau for the solution of which the truncation method is used l and t r a t r a 1 pletshchinsky n b reflection refraction and diffraction of two dimensional elastic waves the method of the redundant task of koshi preprint pmf 04 01 kazan kazan matte about in 2004 2 pleshchinsky n b tumakov d n the method of partial areas for scalar coordinate tasks of the diffraction of electromagnetic waves in classes of generalized functions print 2000 01 kazan matte op in kazan 2000 refined resonances in the system of two weakly tied nonlinear oscillators a v potapov nizhny novgorod state university named after n i lobachevsky consider the system of two weakly knitted nonlinear os of the cyllets 1 x 1 1 x 2 1 x 3 1 x 2 1 2 x 2 2 x 2 x 3 2 x 1 1 176 1 176 1 176 1 176 1 176 1 176 1 176 1 176 1 176 1 176 1 176 1 176 1 176 1 176 1 176
