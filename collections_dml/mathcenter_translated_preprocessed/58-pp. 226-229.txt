2019 or bypass gps services while trying to identity the probable places where a given picture has been taken to solve this problem we used a special type of architecture of neural networks called convolutional neural networks to train our network it was necessary first of all to write a python script that helped to automatically download images from google with the given keywords because we couldn t find any ready dataset we had to create our own after the data collection cleaning and processing the data were still not enough and then we had to apply the data augmentation technique after the dataaugmentation the data increased and we could then train our network we made two convolutional neural network models and we established a voting classifier this made and helped us to obtain great results for future references in order to get a more general and better performing network for recognizing more places we will need to collect more data and train the network with very fined tuned parameters and look for an effective way to use the models that we would get references 1 chollet f deep learning with python f chollet manning shelter island 2018 362 p 2 cornelisse d apr 24 an intuitive guide to convolutional neural networks 2018 3 abdellatif abdelfattah 2017 jul 28 image classification using deep neural network a beginner friendly approach using tensorflow udc 004 85 seegaai deep reinforcement learning in seega c c emezue 1 f p b dossou 2 1 chris emezue gmail com kazan federal university 2 femipancrace dossou gmail com kazan federal university this research paper introduces seegaai a research project to develop a powerful artificial intelligence bot for the game of seega using deep reinforcement learning researchers have long been working on embedding human like behavior in computers a field of research popularly called artificial intelligence hereafter called ai with the advent of personal faster and more efficient computers in our present generation it has become easy to create powerful ais that can play and beat humans at various games like checkers backgammon chess and go 1 as a result several resources concerning the implementation of ai in these gamesresearch papers python libraries game bots online project codes etc are available and easily accessible online on the contrary only few resources from african indigenous games ayo seega abula can be found because little research has beenmade on them these games are however unique because they involve a complex combination of strategy psychology and quick decision making for example playing seega involves two stages placing the players and moving the players which both need strategy to win unlike chess which only requires strategy in moving the players as they have a fixed position and go which involves only placing the player it is for this complex gaming structure of seega that we chose it for our ai project we hope to achieve two things with this project successfully implement deep c c emezue f p b dossou 227 reinforcement learning in seega and provide research materials for implementing machine learning in african indigenous board games keywords seega reinforcement learning artificial intelligence introduction seega is a board battle game played in egypt ethiopia and especially in somalia it became popular in the 19 th century the aim of the game is to capture as many of the opponent s pieces as possible the winner is the player with the most captured pieces seega is a game with complete and perfect information 3 in november 2018 seega was selected for the annual mify artificial intelligence contest 2 this was the first as far as we know approach to designing a sophisticated ai for seega previous research done and what makes seegaai unique the contestants designed their ai using various methods from coding of complex logical decision making processes minimax to implementing alpha beta pruning and other advanced gaming optimization methods all their ai algorithms had one common feature the game decisions were hard coded into the ai through gaming optimization techniques and perhaps expert knowledge of the game of seega seegaai explores a different approach where the ai learns through trial and error about the game the strategy of the game how to make winning moves this approach called reinforcement learning hereafter called rl is akin to the way a child learns to walk in its environment by trying many times failing and learning from experience over the years using reinforcement learning to train computers to play games has produced far better results deepmind s alphazero which is considered unbeatable in chess shogi and go taught itself to play these games from scratch through reinforcement learning alphazero beat all the then powerful computer ais in these games it beat elmo in a s
