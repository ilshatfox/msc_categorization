a new version of the vector qd algorithm classic qd algorithm let sn is some sequence qd quotient difforence the algorithm in the classic version 1 is the calculation of the following type q 0 1 e 0 1 q 1 1 q 0 2 e 1 1 q 2 1 1 elements of which are connected by formulas q n e n q 1 n e 1 n 1 2 q n 1 e n q 1 n e 1 n 3 124 where n 1 2 0 1 initial conditions are selected in the form of e n 0 0 q 1 sa 1 s 4 one of the classicqd algorithm applications is the decomposition of the formal power row f z s 0 s 1 z s 2 z 2 in the continuous fraction of the species f z s 0 1 q 0 1 z 1 e 0 1 z 1 q 0 2 z 1 e 0 2 z 1 suitable fractions of this decomposition give diagonal approximations to a week of the formal steppe series another important property of the algorithm is the convergence of the qd tables to zeros and poles of the corresponding measorphic functions 5 vector qd algorithm j van izeghem in the works 2 3 when studying the properties of joint approximations of the hermitapade for a certain system of markov functions f f 1 f 2 fp where fj z j d j x z x ger k 0 s j k zk 1 a variant of vector qd algorithm was proposed in the vector case we believe that each element is sn s 1 n s 2 n s p n t is a column of p elements the denominators qn of the joint approximations of the hermita pad are vector orthogonal polynomials which satisfy the recurrent ratio of the type qn 1 z an n qn an n 1 qn 1 n pqn p 5 vector qd table has the following view qaven 1 q 1 n e n 1 n q 1 n 1 n e 1 n 1 n 1 n 1 n 1 n 1 n 1 n 1 n e n q 2 n 1 q 1 n 6 125 where eann e n i i n p r 1 r 0 0 the initial conditions are set in the form of e 0 0 q 1 s 1 1 s 1 q n 1 h 1 n 1 h h h n 1 h 1 n 7 where h where h n the corresponding sn determinants of gankel times the dimension of n n with the upper left element s formulas 2 3 connecting the elements of qd tables were expanded in the vector case to q 1 n 1 e 1 n n 1 q 1 e 1 n 1 n 1 n 1 n 8 eaa 1 n i q 1 i 1 e 1 n i 1 e n q n 1 e n 1 i n p one n 1 9 ea 1 n n pq 1 n p 1 e n n pq n 1 n d 10 one of the appendices of the vector qd algorithm is to find the coefficients of recurrent ratios 5 for vector orthogonal polynomials a new version of the vector qd algorithm in the proposed new version of the vector qd algorithm the corresponding determinants of gankel hk dn n pk d dimensions n n are selected with the upper left element s d 1 k this allows you to share a more general version of the algorithm for which the ratio of elements of vector qd tables are similar to the classic scalar version it is instead of the ratios 8 10 we have 1 n p n 1 n nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu 1 n p n 1 nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu 12 with the initial conditions 0 0 1 s d 1 k 1 s d 1 k the new version covers a more complete number of vector orthogonal polynomials which allows you to get a more effective way to calculate their recurrent coefficients the 126 th report provides the results of numerical experiments and a comparative analysis of various versions of the algorithm the work was partially supported by the russian federation project 99 01 01251 l and t r a t ratishauser h deer quotienten diffenezen algorithms z an gew math physik 1954 5 s 233 251 2 van isghem j vector orthogonal relations vector qd algo rithm j comp appl math 1987 v 19 p 141 150 3 van isghem j convergence of the vector qd algorithm zeros of vector orthogonal polynomials j comp appl math 1989 25 p 33 46 4 aptekarev a kaliaguine v van izeghem j genetic sum s representation for the moments of system of stieltjes functions and its applications constitution approximation 2000 v 16 p 487 524 5 grave morris p approximation pad m mir 1986 o v kapabanova m yu kokurin yoshkar ola about one class of regulatory methods of the first kind of first kind in the banach space the linear operator equation ax f x x here a is considered l x is a linear completely continuous operator x is a complex banakh space let their approaches ah l x and fpona and fpons x are known instead of the exact operator a and the right side of f such that ah a l x h f f x we fix the families of endless subspace nl and mm from x we denote through the i a single operator through pl and qm projectors for subspace nl and mm respectively it is assumed that sup l pl l x mm sup m qm l x mm and 127
