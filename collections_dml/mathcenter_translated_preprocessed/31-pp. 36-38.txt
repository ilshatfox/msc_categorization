affin functions in the spaces of incompatible curvature according to buzeman a v galkin pomeranian state university named after mv lomonosov g arkhangelsk in the article 1 determined the afferent displays of geodetic metric spaces and the question has been raised what metric spaces allow non trivial affection functions in particular there are affected functions on non standard metric works of geodetic metric spaces see definition in 2 determination 1 we will say that the set of a in the metric space x is broken into a trivial metric stratification a b m c if 1 topology a coincides with the topology of the work b c 2 all the many species b c are isometric and the projections are b c b c are isometers on the layers 37 3 all many species b c are isometric and the projections are b c b c are isometers on the layers determination 2 geodetic a b in the space of incompatible curvature according to buzeman are parallel if the distance of hausdorf between them is of course hd a b imes geodesic a r x is called regular if in both its directions it serves as a line of the anti gradient for the only accuracy to the orifunction constant theorem 1 let x local compact space of incompatible curvature according to buzeman a r x regular geodetic in x then many points belonging to geodetic parallel a is split into trivial metric stratification of the type y mr where y x x the closed convex set in x obtained by the intersection of the orisfer with the centers at infinitely removed points a urb and a least theorem 2 the spaceship x allows a non trivial affin function f x r in that and only if it is split into the trivial metric stratification of the geodetic metric space y f 1 0 into the material direct r the work is supported by the development program development the scientific potential of higher education project 335 l and t r a t r a 1 lytchak a schroeder v affine function on cat spaces preprint arxiv math mg 0410421 2004 2 bernig a foersch t schroeder v nonstandard metric pro ducts preprint arxiv math mg 0208196 2002 38
