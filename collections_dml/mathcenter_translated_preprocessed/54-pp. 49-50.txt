convergence almost everywhere of double furier series n yu antonov we consider one type of convergence of double trigonometric fourier series intermediate between convergence over squares and convergence for 1 the well known result on the convergence almost everywhere over squares of the fourier series of functions from the class l ln l 2 ln ln ln l 0 2 2 is extended to the case of convergence for some sequences keywords double trigonometric fourier series convergence almost everywhere udc 514 822 examples of display with the s medium characteristic of u k asanbekov 1 a n malyutin 2 1 urmat 1396 mail ru tomsk state university faculty of mechanics and mathematics 2 nmd math tsu ru tomsk state university faculty of mechanics and mathematics in this work examples are given that unlike display with limited distortion 1 for display with s medium characteristics 2 in which the integrals d k s i x f are finite j x f d x and d k s x f d x the restraint and degree on compacts from the compact of the from do not take place keywords limitations averaging compactness this work provides examples showing that unlike display with limited distortion 1 for display with an medium characteristic 2 in which the integrals d k s i x f j x f are finite d x and d k s x f d x limited multiplicity and degree on compacts from d generally speaking does not take place consider the display with the s medium characteristic 2 here are the following two examples example 1 twisting around the torah axis in the space of r 3 we consider thor d the points of which x x 1 x 2 x 3 are described using curved coordinates x 1 r r cos cos x 2 r r cos sin x 3 r sin where 0 2 0 2 0 r r and r a certain positive number let x x 21 x 22 designing through d 1 circumference x x r x 3 0 in the region d we set the display 50 materials of the international school conference f r 7 r r pison r 0 where p is some arbitrary negative number and put f x x if x d 1 display f is obviously continuous and limited in d at the same time it is locally homeomorphic at points x d r 0 all points of the set d 1 display f transfers into itself and each circle with the center on d 1 which lies in a two dimensional plane orthogonal d 1 when displayed also passes into itself from this it is easy to see that the display f is openly and continuously differentiated at points x d d 1 and j x f r p 0 since the 2 dimensional measure of the label of the set d 1 is zero and narrowing f to any straight line that does not pass through d 1 continuously differentiated then f is an acl point if point x costs the circle described above once in any direction then point f x will bypass the same circle in the same direction r p 1 time now take a compact f d containing some points from d 1 if y y 1 y 2 y 3 f x then y 1 r r cosr p cos y 2 r r cosr p sin y 3 r sinr pison therefore on the circle y r 2 y 3 r 2 there is at least m of prototypes of the set f to do this you need to choose r so that the ball of radius r with the center on d 1 lies in many f and the whole part of r p the number r p is at least m this means that the limitations on compact compacts of display f does not take place since j x f 0 for x d d 1 then n y f g y f g for all sizes g where n y f g the multiplicity and y f g a degree or topological display index f relative to the point f and area g consequently limitations on compacts to display f display from the s medium characteristic does not take place we will show further that the integrates that characterize the display with the s medium characteristic converge see 2 let 0 0 are arbitrary numbers we will make sure that you can choose p 0 so that the integrals d k i x f j x f d x d k o x f d x were finite if x d 1 then k o ki x f j x f 1 if x d d 1 then j x f r p ko x f 3 4 2 p 2 3 2 r 2 p and since ki x f k 2 o x f therefore d k i x f j x f d x c 2 1 0 r 2 p p 1 dr mm if 0 p 22 1 d k i x f d x c 3 as well as 1 0 r 4 p 1 dr mm if 0 p 12 thus both of these integrals are finite simultaneously if 0 p max 12 22 1 similarly the following example is obtained 2 twisting around the point in the space of r 3 we consider the area d which is a ball x 21 x 22 x 23 1 with the center at the beginning of the coordinates and radius 1 in the region d set the display f r 7 r r pison if 0 r 0 and f x x for x 0 note that in 3 examples and methods of finding a spherical module are given literature 1 reshetnyak yu g spatial display with limited distortion novosibirsk science 1982 28
