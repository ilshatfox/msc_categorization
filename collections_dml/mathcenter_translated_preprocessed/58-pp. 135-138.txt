the dependence of the coefficient of oil displacement on the degree of kern heterogeneity g a nikiforov in this work the isothermal flow of two incompressible immiscible liquids in a porous medium is simulated taking into account capillary and gravitational forces it is believed that oil has nonnewtonian properties deviations from the linear darcy filtration law are taken into account by introducing into the law of oilmotion a function that depends on the filtration rate the statement of the problem is used in the variables speed saturation numerical examples demonstrate the influence of kern heterogeneity on oil displacement coefficient in the calculations performed the kern is composed of well and poorly permeable blocks while the average absolute permeability of the kern is always preserved it was revealed that the oil displacement coefficient depends on the sizes of well and poorly permeable kern blocks keywords kern non newtonian oil two phase flow 004 62 159 9 07 1 1 konnikolaeff yandex ru vk api 136 2019 facebook 1 2 564 facebook python api pyodbc microsoft sql server id api vk com http 5000 wall get ip 100
