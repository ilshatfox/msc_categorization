singular integrals with a shift of the singular integrates acting in various functional spaces and close methods of their calculation are a rather well studied mathematical object due to the fact that regular and singular integrals are accurately calculated in rare private cases the methods of their approximate calculation and the assessment of the error allowed are of particular interest in the works 1 2 not only these issues are quite highlighted but also the issues of optimizing the endless approximations of the singular integrals in particular much attention is paid to optimization by k f for singular integrals with hilbert and koshi nuclei which have numerous applications in various fields of natural science similar issues for the singular integrals with a shift of the integration contour relate to the poorly studied section of mathematical analysis and were not considered in mathematical literature moreover the task of constructing quadrature formulas for integrals with a shift and study of their disintegration in various spaces that were convenient in the applications fell out of view such tasks were set and partially solved in 3 and the issues of constructing the optimal monograph in the sense of 1 methods for calculating the singular integrals with a shift and some extreme tasks of quadrators theory are devoted to this work of the author using the assessments of the norms of shift operators singular integration as well as special operators acting in the space of v v ivanov w below in terms 1 we give one of the results of this work theorem let f w rh w then vn f n r ln n r 0 0 1 and the quadrature formulas considered in the work are optimal in order among the possible quadrature formulas of the type of wsx t wspnx t n k 1 x tk ak t where wx t x t t the function of shifting a special type of single circle on itself for arbitrary shifts constructing optimal accuracy and in terms of the number of operations the f f remains relevant at 236 the task of constructing and research by k f is also relevant taking into account the features of the function of shifting the contour on themselves g optimal approximations of decisions of linear problems kazan publishing house of kazan university 1980 232 p 2 gabdulkhaev b g cleaned approximation of the single of lyarn integrals and direct methods for solving integral and integro dispensal equations results of science and technology mathema analysis m publishing house of vinity of the ussr academy of sciences 1980 v 18 s 251 307 3 shakirov i a candida dissertation kazan 1991 f a shamoyan bryan sk on polynomial approximations in the weight anisotropic spaces of the holomorphic in the polycolous functions let dn z z 1 zn zj 1 j 1 n a single polycryg in the n dimensional complex cn h dn many of all the holomorphic functions in dn r 1 r 1 wor rn r r 1 rn uction monotonously growing positive functions on 0 ap ship f h dn f ap ship dn f z p exp pul 1 1 z dm 2 n z 1 p nder dm 2 n 2 n dimensional measure of the lebey on dn exp 1 1 z n j 1 exp ventral 1 1 zj 237
