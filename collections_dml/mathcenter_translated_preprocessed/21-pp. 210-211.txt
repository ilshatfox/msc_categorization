geometric features of the algebraic surface v v teplyakov pomeranian state university f math pomorsu ru examines the features of the spherical display s 3 algebraic surface f 3 e x xj a 2 its curvature l si j s 4 and topological structure this surface is a multidimensional analogue of the known narrowing surface with eight special points lxl iyi lzl a 3 112 the order of the seventh like in special points the second form is 1 e and the spherical display f 2 s 2 is two faced the three dimensional analogue of this surface f 3 from e 4 has the next properties f 3 is also a hyperbolic surface it has eight departures for infinity in the form of tapering labor yuk 8 2 x r and the belts of these tubes are only enough and lico many special then 1 k on f 3 is a graph from the top at 32 points from each vertex it leaves along 6 ribs in the vertices of this graph the core of the spherical display has a dimension of ker d 2 on the ribs of the column kcr d 1 nevertheless in the vicinity of these points the spherical display remains homeomorphism about the surroundings of the vertices of the graph the spherical display is not in in person and has an unknown feature 210 these results were obtained using the properties of the gradient disposal grad f f 1 r 4 o a oo where l x xj this is l si j s 4 display associated with the spherical display f s 3 by the next switching diagram d grod t r 4 l p txf t s x where d grad differential gradient display d tzhf t x s 3 txf differential spherical disposal id txf r 4 identical entry r r 4 txf projection r 4 for subspace i e transition to go risont 111 a component of the differential of the gradient d grad j v v grad f y n v n ly vn v n where grad x j the diagram shows that the own vectors d txf txf these are the horizon the same as the signs of the corresponding values of d grad x this allows you to calculate the signature of the second square shape of the surface under consideration literature 1 bromol and others rimanova geometry as a whole m mir 1971 2 balkman and others introduction to differential geometry as a whole m science 1973 211
