economic equilibrium problems e volotskaya kazan state university we consider an economic application of the mixed variational inequality problem which involves a continuous mapping and a convex but not necessarily differentiable function we specialize several existence and uniqueness results for this problem and describe results of solving such a problem via the d gap function approach 1 introduction letk and v be nonempty convex sets in the real euclidean space rn k v let f v r be a convex but not necessarily differentiable function and let g v rn be a mapping the mixed variational inequality problem mvi for short is the problem of finding x k such that g x x x f x f x 0 x k 1 1 problem 1 1 was originally considered by lescarret 1 and browder 2 and afterwards studied by many authors e g see 3 4 it reduces to the usual variational inequality problem vi for short in the case where f 0 most of the works are devoted to establish existence and uniqueness results for problem 1 1 under various assumptions on g and f and suggest solution methods this work is devoted to an economic application of mvi 1 1 namely we consider the economic equilibrium problem in the case where each i th consumer demands a single commodity we show that this problem can be reformulated as mvi of form 1 1 where the mapping g is m 0 we present several existence and uniqueness results for this class of problems in addition properties obtained enable us to find a solution of mvi 1 1 with the help of the dgap function approach which was adjusted for such problems in 5 6 it consists in converting mvi 1 1 into the problem of finding a stationary point of a differentiable function therefore one can 242 e volotskaya find economic equilibrium with the help of the usual differentiable optimization methods such as the steepest descent and conjugate gradient methods in what follows for a vector x rn x 0 respectively x 0 means xi 0 respectively xi 0 for all i 1 n rn denotes the nonnegative orthant in rn i e rn x rn x 0 rn denotes the interior of r n i e rn x rn x 0 we denote by in the identity map in r n i e the n n unit matrix for a set e e denotes the family of all subsets of e 2 preliminaries in this section we recall several definitions and related properties of mappings definition 2 1 7 8 an n n matrix a is said to be a a p matrix if it has positive principal minors b a p 0 matrix if it has nonnegative principal minors c a z matrix if it has non positive off diagonal entries d an m matrix if it has non positive off diagonal entries and its inverse a 1 exists and has non negative entries it is well known that an n n matrix a is p if and only if for every vector x 6 0 there exists an index k such that xkyk 0 where y ax similarly a is p 0 if and only if for every vector x there exists an index k such that xkyk 0 xk 6 0 where y ax also it is well known that a is m if and only if a p z see 7 8 hence each m matrix is p but the reverse assertion is not true in general definition 2 2 7 8 an n n matrix a is said to be an m 0 matrix if it is both p 0 and z matrix the following proposition gives a criterion for a matrix a to be an m or m 0 matrix 243 on a class of economic equilibrium problems proposition 2 1 7 suppose a is a z matrix if there exists a vector x 0 such that ax 0 respectively ax 0 then a is an m matrix respectively m 0 matrix now we recall extensions of these properties for mappings definition 2 3 9 let u be a convex subset of rn a mapping f u rn is said to be a a p mapping if max 1 i n xi yi fi x fi y 0 for all x y u x 6 y b a p 0 mapping if for all x y u x 6 y there exists an index i such that xi 6 yi and xi yi fi x fi y 0 c a uniform p mapping if there exists 0 such that max 1 i n xi yi fi x fi y x y 2 for all x y u if f is affine i e f x ax b then f is a p mapping p 0 mapping if and only if its jacobian f x a is a p matrix p 0 matrix in the general nonlinear case if the jacobian f x is a p matrix then f is a p mapping but the reverse assertion is not true in general at the same time f is a p 0 mapping if and only if its jacobian f x is a p 0 matrix e g see 6 9 10 definition 2 4 e g see 4 11 12 let u be a convex subset of rn a mapping q u rn is said to be a strongly monotone with constant 0 if for all u u u and q q u q q u we have q q u u u u 2 b strictly monotone if for all u u u u 6 u and q q u q q u we have q q u u 0 c monotone if for all u u u and q q u q q u we have q q u u 0 244 e
