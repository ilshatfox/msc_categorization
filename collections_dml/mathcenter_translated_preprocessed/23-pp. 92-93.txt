degenerate hypergeometric function and solutions of quasi line equations in its recent work 2 p 350 l simon set the task of the existence of entire solutions of the following quasi linear equation of an elliptical type uxx 1 u 2 x 2 ucyuxuy uyy 1 u 2 y 0 1 the purpose of this report is to show that for for equation 1 the property of bernstein has not been performed that is there is a non trivial family of whole solutions theorem for any natural n 2 there is a whole solution un x y which is material analytical in the entire plane and grows on infinity as lim sup x y x y x 2 y 2 n 2 1 n n 2 2 n 1 at the same time the following parametric representation occurs x a cos 2 n 1 b cos y a sin 2 n 1 b sin un f f cos n 2 where a 1 2 f k f b 1 2 f k f f k k k 2 2 1 k 2 2 3 a c t degenerated hypergeometric function of the cummer and k n n 1 since the conversion of the lyindra was used when constructing n the un the main difficulty is the clarification of which decisions of the obtained linear equation correspond to unambiguous solutions globally defined in r 2 1 note that the evidence of the injection of this display is based on the properties of the function of the kummer 1 ch 6 and in particular for the following statement 94 lemma function a b where a and b are defined b 3 non negative monotonously increasing and there is the limiting ratio lim ger a b 1 2 n 1 the work was carried out with the support of the rfff post no 03 01 00304 a l and t r a t r a 1 batment g erdeii a higher transcendental functions hyper geometric function lyandra functions m science 1965 2 simon l asymptotics for exterior solutions of quasilinear ellipents equations geometry from pac rim berlin new york de gruyter 1997 p 343 362 3 tkachev v g algebraic structure of harmonic functions j math anal appl in the press p n ivanshin kazan pyotr ivanshin ksu ru the spectrum of one family of operators on a variety with the breakdown let m diversity with the placement of f generated by the locally free action of the switching group of li h let it still m f set the integrated connectivity of the eresman invariant regarding the action of h consider the operatorh d 2 dx 2 v on l 2 h p determined for each layer of laying f where v c 0 m that is h determines the family of schr dinger operators hp p matter hp l 2 rn l 2 rn where n dim h using the flok representation apparatus 1 the following series of statements can be proved drying 1 let h compact group then the spectrum of the schr dinger operator h d 2 dx 2 v continuously depends on the parameter p p drying 2 spectrum of the schr dinger operator h d 2 dx 2 v where v is evenly a periodic function there is a limit celest 95
