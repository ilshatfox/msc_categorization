the shifts of the sequences of positive numbers are known to study the completeness of the systems of exterous monomas in particular the exhibit is played by special integral functions of the exponential type which turn into zero at least the follower of the indicators n nhern of this system this means that the study of the geometric characteristics of the subsequent integrated numbers is important for obtaining the results relating to completeness work 1 and 2 so far they call that the upper density of n the maximum density n 0 as well as the upper logarithm block density l of the positive followed by the following way are of great importance n lim t 1 t n 6 t 1 lim n n n n 0 lim 0 0 lim t nder 1 t 1 t n 6 t 1 l lim a lim t 1 ln a t n 6 at 1 n our study is as follows let m n n n and n norn non layered sequences of positive numbers with the only limiting point urb associated with the ratio n n n where n 0 suppose that the limit of lim n n n 1 130 z z rizvanov e i fazleeva exists and is equal to a 6 1 theorem if 1 a 2 l m 2 6 0 then the following formulas are true n n m 1 a n 0 n 0 m 1 a l l m 1 a l and t r a t r a 1 malliavinp rubel l a on small entire functions of exponential type with given zeros bulletin de la smf 1961 t 89 s 175 206 2 habibullinb n the completeness of systems exhibits and many uniqueness ufa ric bashgu 2011 176 p 3 koossis p the logarithmic integral i cambridge cambridge university press 1988 606 p z rizvanov e i fazleeva kazan volzhsky federal university rizvanov zemfir mail ru elmira fazleeva mno maries of teaching plot problems to move in the school course of mathematics for a long time tasks play a huge role in learning the solution of problems acts as a goal and as a means of training the ability to compose and solve problems is one of the main indicators of the level of development of students solving this problem a person acquires mathematical knowledge
