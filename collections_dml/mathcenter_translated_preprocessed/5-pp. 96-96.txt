analytical study of the characteristics of the filt the projection method is known that iterative methods to obtain close solutions of initial quality problems in analytical form are closely related to the classical problem of chebyshev s moments 1 arkov they are favorably differed by quickly gone the bridge of consistent approaches in this work the use of the elements of functional analysis in the study of the characteristics of the filtration stream by the methods of ga raters on the ritz allowed them to consider them as a single projection method of moments for the latter the system of basic elements are solutions to recurrent differential equations built on the basis of the original initial stringed task a unified approach to the implementation of the tasks under consideration allowed to obtain close analytical dependencies between the characteristics of the filtration flow in the development of oil fields in the study of various questions related to irrigation and ecology in accordance with addictions are widely used in solving reverse problems in practical research v p kadushin kazan the projection and identical method of solving the singular integral equation with a monotonous opera is considered the singular integral equation with comprehensively unknown on a single circle kr p t ilr p t g t t r p t dt f t t e 1 2 t j 96
