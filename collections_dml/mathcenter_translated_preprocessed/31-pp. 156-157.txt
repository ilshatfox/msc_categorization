orifunctional border of the strictly convex plane of minkovsky v v tyukhtin pomeranian state university named after mv lomonosov g arkhangelsk 156 under the space of minkovsky we mean a final normalized space in 1 compacting xh is determined for an arbitrary local compact metric space x m riffel 2 calls such a compacting metric and in 3 it is called orifunctional the points of the orifunctional border are the so called orifunctions that is the limits of distance functions of the type dx y x y o x where o x is the marked point in addition to the orifunctional for the spaces of incompatible curvature in the sense of buzeman the so called geodetic compacting xg is determined the geodetic boundary gx xg x is formed by the classes of asymptotic geodetic rays theorem let v 2 the plane of minkovsky with a strictly convex norm then there is such a homeomorphism ffic hv 2 s 1 orifunctional boundaries of space v 2 on the euclidean sphere that the next diagram s 1 hv 2 1 pr s pr gv 2 is switching here s s 1 gaussian spherical image of the indicature of the norm s pinger s gv 2 central projection and pr hv 2 gv 2 display that compares each orifunction its direction of the anti gradient with n 2 the statement similar to our theorem is unfair 157
