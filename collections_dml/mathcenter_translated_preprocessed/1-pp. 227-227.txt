explicitly global uniforms of algebraic correspondence to o b dolgopolov belarusian state university the problem of global uniforms of multi digit analytic conformity is understood as the problem of finding methods of transmission from the implicit assignment f z w o to the parameter tank mission z rp t w lf t the parameter where p and lj unambiguous measures of morphic functions from parameter t the work is dedicated to the problem of the obvious construction of the global uniform of mication we limit ourselves to the most simple case of uniforms of algebraic correspondence f z w about wanting to simplify the procedure for uniforms we will refuse to use automorphic functions as uniforms instead we implement the following geometric idea having cut the surface to rimanov set by the equation f z w o according to some cries we will turn it into rimanov the surface of the genus with the edge after that we build another closed surface of the genus zero which includes this surface with the edge as a sub form siv ziv is a conformally constructed closed surface on the sphere c expressed the sought global uniforms in an explicit form through the disposal of a longing function of course there are great arbitrariness here which can be used to simplify the task the implementation of the presented idea made it possible to prove the existence of such a global uniforms z rp t w lj t that one of the functions of rp t lf t is rational literature 1 zvezchrovy ch e i about the possibility of obvious construction of a global unit 227
