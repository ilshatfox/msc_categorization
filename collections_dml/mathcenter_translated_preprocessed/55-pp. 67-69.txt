sufficient conditions of the completeness of exponential systems in convex domains a f kuzhaev we give some sufficient conditions for the completeness of the system of exponential monomials in convex domains this result is a generalization of a classical proposition on completeness of exponential monomials systems with positive exponents in a convex domain when these exponents have not density the proposition was obtained by a leontiev and b levin independently it is discovered that the condition of sequence s measurability i e existence of its density can be replaced by the condition of equality of its upper and maximum densities keywords density of sequence entire function completeness convex domain 519 62 o 1 1 oxxy 4893 mail ru yf 22 1992 2 68 1 x y x x y x y z z y z 1 x m 1 x 0 5 m 0 m 1 x 1 x 1 0 5 s m 0 x 0 x 0 2 8 4562 12 0732 0 0052 m 0 0 14 m 1 1 1468 s 0 9668 0 0 2 3 c 1 c 2 3 1 3 1 1 1 burkin i m khien n analytical numerical methods of finding hidden oscillations in multidimensional dynamical systems differential equations 2014 v 50 no 13 p 1695 1717 2 leonov g a kuznetsov n v vagaitsev v i localization of hidden chuas attractors phys lett app 2011 no 375 p 2230 2233 3 2015 1 c 26 34 structure of the global attractor of the generalized chua system o i kuznetsova we consider the problem of finding unstable orbits in autonomous systems of differential equations the results of reberty shooting method for the generalized chua system are given through which it is 69 possible to find an unstable trajectory in a dynamic system keywords three dimensional dynamical systems unstable trajectories numerical methods shooting method iterative methods 517 5 1 1 kuzovatov yandex ru z x 1 re z x 2 x
