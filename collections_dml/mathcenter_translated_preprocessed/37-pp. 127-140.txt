the approximate solution of the problem of filtering viscoplastic fluid to the horizontal well is an accurate formula for calculating the flow rate of a vertical well in a circular layer with a non linear filtration law with the maximum gradient has 1 q 2 kh ln rk rc 4 p rk rc 4 p rk rc 1 q 0 4 p 6 rk rc where k is the permeability of the formation h its thickness rk is the radius of the power circuit 4 p is the pressure drop the maximum gradient is the viscosity of the liquid rc is the radius of the well an approximate formula for calculating the flow rate of a horizontal well gs is obtained if in 1 replace rc with the given radius of r c the above radius is determined from the condition of the equality of the flow rate of the fittal of the enlarged vertical well of the radius r c in the case of linear filtration in a circular layer let the length of the gs be l and its axis is defended from the sole of the layer at a distance of the beginning of the coordinates will be placed in the center of the gs and the x axis will be directed along the axis of the well replace the gs with a linear source of uniform intensity in a dimensionless form the exact solution of the

the gs in a circular layer was solved numerically by the final elements with a non stationary influx of liquid to the gs put into work with a constant moron at each moment in the layer two areas are formed in the layer the filtering area and the zone where the current is absent over time the border between these zones moves from gs to the power contour numeric calculations showed that at small times the pressure in the gs practically does not depend on the value of the limit gradient and the deviation of the pressure from the linear filtration mode occurs in later times and increases with the growth of an additional difference in 129 pressure 4 p rk r c which is lost to overcoming the shift gradient is well consistent with the results of the numerical calculations of the stationary

numbers the flat task of the flow of incompatible fluid in a square cavity with a mobile upper lid over the past 40 years attracts the constant attention of specialists in computational hydrodynamics it actually became test during the testing of new discrete schemes for solving the equations of navier stox particular importance in this case is attached to the construction of stationary solutions of the problem under the large numbers of reynolds 1 3 in this work the stationary problem is solved by ended methods in primary variables on a uniform grid with span nodes the diverse scheme has 130
