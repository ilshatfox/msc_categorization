one scheme for constructing the correct expansion of the differential operator e n isaev nizhny novgorod state university named after n i lobachevsky issues of the general theory of boundary tasks were discussed in the labor of m i vishika l hurmander a a dezin and other authors these issues are directly related to the concept of right extensions of differential operations in these ra bots in particular the existence of correct tasks and correct extensions was proved it is of interest in the structure of structural schemes of the correct extensions of the differential operations this work discusses one of the approaches associated with the method of orthogonal television different from the approach considered by a as an example of the application of this scheme we consider 114 the task of constructing the correct extensions for ordinary differential operations with constant coefficients of the order n p d dx n i 1 ai di dxi an 6 0 in particular it is shown shows that it is shown that any correct task that meets the correct expansion of the differential operation p d dx can be formulated as follows p dx u x f x f l 2 x u x ek x dx qk x f x where qk is the solution of the equation p qk x ek x k 1 n e 1 x en x orthonormated nucleus base using the method of orthogonal design we will write down the solution of this problem in this way u x n k 1 f onic k p onic n k 1 e kx qk x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f dx where inous is an orthogonal normalized system of its own vectors that meet their own values k the work discusses examples of specific boundary tasks and the lines of calculating the coefficients of qk x the author expresses gratitude to a v kalinin for help in writing work l and t r a t r a 1 vishik m i on general regional tasks for elliptic differential equations tr mosk matte o v 1952 t 1 115 2 disin a a general issues of the theory of boundary tasks m nauka 1980 3 diszin a a differential operator equations method of model operators m science 2000 t 229 4 hurmander l equations with private derivatives m science 1968 filter convection in the channel with local heating and cooling the walls of e i kalinin a b mazo kazan state university kalininei yandex ru the topic of the report is a numerical study of convective processes in the porous environment arising in a tilt channel with local heating and cooling the walls the channel of a single width is considered inclined to go risontali on the angle fig 1 rice 1 on the boundaries of 3 and 4 the temperatures of 1 and 1 are maintained respectively the boundaries 1 and 2 are thermal insulated at the entrance the temperature of the liquid is zero 116
