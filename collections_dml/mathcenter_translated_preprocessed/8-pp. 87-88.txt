the limits of the function in the categories of coverage and covering groups in algebraic topology are well known for the following fact if p x g is the cover of a linearly coherent and local linearly connected group g of a linearly coherent space x then in x there is a group structure that turns p into the homomorphism of groups 1 theorem 79 it turns out that for the endless cover of a compact coherent group with a coherent covering space this theorem is also fair this result is based on the fact mentioned above and the theorem 1 formulated below which speaking of the inconspicuous claims that any n lord cover of this group is approximated by the n lis covers of smooth groups let s move on to the exact wording let n cov be a category the objects of which are the n lute covers of compact coherent groups with compact connected connecting spaces morphism between the two objects p x g and q y h of this category we define as pair f x y h g h consisting of continuous display and continuous homomorphism such that q f h p the composition of morphisms is determined in a standard way as in the category of morphisms from the arbitrary category through n cov diff we denote the subcategory in n cov consisting of coverage of groups or in other words subcategoria of groups without small subgroups 2 theorem 1 for each object p n cov there is a controversial function f p n cov from the category of a directed set p such that p is a projective limit f in n cov and f accepts the values of n cov diff 87 theorem 2 let p x g the endpoint cover of the compact coherent group g with a coherent topological space x then you can introduce the structure of the topological group in space x such that p will become the homomorphism of compact groups moreover in the case of the abel group g display p becomes the homomorphism of compact abele groups previously theorem 2 was proved for the case of solenoids in 3 l and t r a t r a 1 pontryagin l s continuous groups m nauka 1984 2 gleason a groups with small subgroups ann math 1952 v 56 no 2 p 193 212 3 grigorian s a gumerov r n kazantsev a v group structure in finite coverings of compact solenoid groups lobachevskij j math 2000 vi p 39 46 a p gurevich a p khromov saratov on the closure in the space of cq 0 1 the area of determination of the differential operator we denote through dl the area of determination of the differential operator ly y n x p 2 x y n 2 x pn x y x pj x c 0 1 x 0 1 1 with the edge conditions of the type vj y uj y y ip 0 j 0 1 n 2 where uj y n 1 k 0 ajky k 0 bjky k 1 y worj 1 0 y x ip x dx uction x c 0 1 we assume that the forms of uj y are normalized 1 p 65 66 operators of the type 1 2 are found e g in 2 88
