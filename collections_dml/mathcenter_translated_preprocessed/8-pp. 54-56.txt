positively interpolation spaces for a pair of ordered banach spaces everywhere further x x 0 x 1 indicate an interpolation pair of ordered banach spaces i e we believe that the banakh of the xi spaces with closed sponge ki cones are invested in some separated topological vector space v c closed cone v and ki v i 0 1 through l x we denote the many limited linear operators in pair x translating ki into ki i 0 1 definition the space x with a closed cone k v invested in the x 0 x 1 banakhovo will be called positively interpolation for pair x if any operator from l x translates k to k offer if the space x with the k cone is positively interpolarly for x and the cone k generating then x interpolation for positive operators in x i e any operator from l x translates x to x and there is constant c 0 that t x x c max t x 0 x 0 t x 1 x 1 for any t l x we give one method of constructing a positively interpol spaces let y the space interpolation for pair x in the usual sense and let ky the closure of k 0 k 1 in y put x x x x x ky x inf x y x y x x x x x ky 54 theorem the space with the norm and the ky cone is positively interpolation for a pair x similarly you can build positively interpolation spaces based on one of the ki cones and the interpolation space containing the xi we illustrate the proposed design on the example of constructing an serial analogue of the intersection space for a pair of non communist spaces l 1 lux let h a sepaable calbert space with some highlighted basis b is the algebra of all limited operators in h each operator a b is presented as an endless matrix a ai j j 1 let i i 1 according to the advance of strictly positive numbers satisfying the condition et i 1 1 2 i mm for the positive operator a ai j ger j 1 we put ffic a happen i 1 a 2 i 1 2 i 1 ia 2 i 2 i then is the exact normal semi inferior weight on b now we take the material space l 1 as x 1 and as x 0 the material space linger realized as the spaces of ermital bilinear forms on the lines of weight dense lineal in h see e g 1 these spaces make up an interpolation pair of ordered banach spaces if we count the cone ki in them with formed positive bilinear forms as an interpolation space y we take a banahovo space of the intersection of the engine of engine x 0 x 1 and build a space according to the above scheme the resulting space is loosely invested in and unmarried into we emphasize that in the considered example is not only not interpolation for pair x in the usual sense but is not even intermediate for x the work is supported by the rffif project 01 01 00129 l and tr trunov n v sherstnev a n the introduction into the theory of a non performance of tatative integration consp problem matte the latest up to 55 style t 27 results of science and technology vinity of the ussr academy of sciences m 1985 c 167 190 e b vladova ulyanovsk the probability of space with a unitaryly generated one and a half line form in this message describes the half following and in terms of half traces probability on the hyperbolic logic of projectors let m the algebra of the neumann in the hilbert space h and let u eiison the unitary operator algebra m is called w u algebra if m r u 2 w u algebra m is called w p albro if at least one of the projectors p e 0 or p i e 0 is final relative to the let pu p m p 2 p upx y ux py x y h projector p pu is called the maximum positive maximum negative if the ph is the maximum positive maximum negative subspace relative to indepinite metric 2 p i x y x y h let p u p u a lot of all positive negative projectors in pu and p m p m are many maximum positive maximum negative projectors in pu for any p p u we denote through e p the orthopriotector on p ph each projector e pu seems not the only way in the form e e e e p u the material measure pu r is called half a trace if there are an exact normal semi inferior trace and the operator m attached to the center of the algebra is such that or p t l 1 m and then e e te e pu or p t l 1 m and then e te e pu for a factor case the weakened version of the theorem 1 formulated below was previously proved by m s matveychuk theorem 1 let pu r measure on w u algebra ple 56
