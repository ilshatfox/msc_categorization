almost solvability for classes of nonlinear integral equations of the first kind m yu kokurin using the convexity properties of images of completely continuous nonlinear integral operators we give the description of convex closed cones which are included either into the recessive cone or into the tangent cone for the closed image of the operator under investigation depending on characteristics of the integrant the constructed cones are determined by the principal part in the asymptotics of the integrant at infinity and do not depend on the variation of its subordinate part applications to the generalized solvability of the first kind nonlinear integral equations are discussed keywords nonlinear integral operator recessive cone tangent cone equation of the first kind solvability 517 54 1 1 ia kolesnikov mail ru 2 l w w 2 l l w w 2 2 w 0 w 0 190 1 1 f z c z 0 2 f f z f z 3 2 f z f z 1 2 n k 1 lk 2 sin 2 z ak 2 mk cot z ak 2 g z 1 ak k 1 2 n a 0 k 0 2 lk 1 2 1 2 k k 0 2 k k 1 2 n a 0 k mk k 1 2 n g z 2 1 f lim z f z z 0 z g z 0 n k 1 mk 0 d t 0 t t d 0 m 0 t 2 m 0 t t m z 0 t 2 m d 0 t 0 t 0 t 0 t 0 2 0 ak 1 an t a 0 t a 1 t ak t 2 0 t t a 0 k 1 n 0 1 k 0 2 d t 0 t t w 0 d t 2 3 4 5 3 0 t t ak t mk t k 0 1 n a 0 f d t d ak t d t cot k t k 1 n 191 d t d t 2 m 0 t 2 d mk t d t 1 2 mk lk cot k t sin 2 k t k 1 n k t ak t t 2 4 2 1 n 0 2 0 t x p t a 0 x x 1 x 2 x 2 a k x ak 0 ak 1 x ak 2 x 2 k 1 n m k x mk 0 mk 1 x mk 2 x 2 k 2 n 1 m k x mk 1 x mk 0 mk 1 x mk 2 x 2 k 0 1 n ak t x a k x mk t x m k x k
