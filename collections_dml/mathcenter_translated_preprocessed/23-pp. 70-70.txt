the quasi resolved periodic abelevs of the group yu l ershov in 1 introduced an important concept of quasi zerosolvent permissible set and proved the statements 1 the hereditally final variety over the model of the regular theory of quasi rezerezolvently 2 in a quasi zerosolvent permissible set there is a universal function by analogy with this concept in 2 3 the concepts of a quasi zerosolvent 1 quasineral model are introduced and the quasi zerosolvent algebras of ershov and abeli p groups are described this message explores the quasi resolved periodic abelev groups a sufficient condition is given for the arbitrary model m to be quasyrezolvent periodic abeleva group g is called p quasirezolvent if there is such its quasi zerisolvent gn n which is for any numbers p n where p is a simple number the condition is true the primary component g p of the group g either intersects from gn to zero or g p gn the necessary and sufficient condition is given for the periodic abelev group g is p quadsirezolvent an example of a p quadsirezolvent periodic abeleve group which is not quasi isolive has been built let the periodical ableva group g are such that any of its non level primary p component is a direct amount of a certain number of copies of the cyclic group zp procedure p a necessary and sufficient condition has been found to ensure that group g is quasirzolvent l and t r a t r a 1 ershov yu l determining and computability novosibirsk a scientific book siberian school of algebra and logic 1996 2 2 khismiev a n on quasi resolve models and b models algebra and logic 2001 t 40 no 4 s 484 500 3 khisamiev a n on quasi zerosolvent models algebra and lo gik in the press 72
