line invariant families of display of the ball and the flea function in cn 155 the concept of a linear invariant family l i s of analytical in the circle b b 1 z c z 1 the functions were first introduced and studied by pommerenka in 1 the linear invariation of the family is locally single in b functions f z z means that along with each function f m this family also belongs to the function f z f 0 f 0 0 z with any conformal automorphism z circle b one of the examples of l i s the class s class s is single and analytical in the circle b functions of the specified type in 1997 in 2 the concept of l i s it was transferred to local billarfic display of a single ball bn n 1 b 2 studied l i s such display it should also be noted that even earlier such a generalization was undertaken in 3 for the case of n 2 unfortunately when the equality is withdrawn 5 3 in 2 a significant error was made however this false equality 5 3 formed the basis of evidence of some statements in 2 4 so in 4 three of the six theorems are equipped with evidence based on equality 5 3 lempting equality 5 3 began to use other authors in their works in 5 we have developed a method of lowering the dimension which allows you to reduce tasks for l i s in the bn ball to the corresponding tasks in b 1 with the help of this method it was possible not only to correct evidence of theorems from 2 4 but also to strengthen these theorems as well as get new results the most important example of l i s in bn is the kn family of all billarfic display f ball bn to convex areas in cn for such display in 6 inequality 1 z 2 df z was proved 1 z 1 z 2 z bn 1 it was stated that the equality here is achieved to display f z 1 zn 1 z 1 1 z 1 zn kn 156 with n 1 inequality 1 is indeed accurate for each z b otherwise the situation is with n 2 here the equality in the left part 1 is achieved at the point z 0 however at r z 0 0 917 we have received inequality 1 1 r 2 1 r n n n 1 n 1 r n n n 1 n df z f kn where n 1 2 n 1 2 moreover it turned out that for accuracy in kn inequality of the type 1 1 z c df z it is necessary that c 2 2 2 n thus the question of the exact lower assessment df z in kn remains open for n 2 our research in this direction leads to the hypothesis 1 1 z df z f kn z b n n 2 the identified connection of l i s with a flea space it allows you to transfer the obtained in l i s the results on the flea function l and t r a t r a 1 pommerenke ch linear invariante familen analytischer funk tionen i math ann 1964 hf 155 s 108 154 2 pfaltzgraff j a distortion of locally biholomorphic maps of the n ball comples variables 1997 v 33 p 239 253 3 barnard r v fitzgerald c h gong s a distortion theorem for biholomorphic mappings in c 2 trans amer math soc 1994 v 344 p 907 924 4 pfaltzgraff j a suffridge t j an extension theorem and linear invariant families generated by starlike maps ann univ mariae curie sk lodowska sect a 1999 v 53 p 193 203 157 5 lichbersky p starkov v v line invariant families of the holomorphic display of the ball the method of lowering the dimension sib mat g 2001 in print 6 pfaltzgraff j a suffridge t j norm order and geometric properties of holomorphic mappings in cn j anal math 2000 v 82 p 285 313 a g losev volgograd classification of quasi made riman varieties this work is devoted to the study of the behavior of the solutions of the equation lu 1 x div x u c x u 0 1 where x and c x smooth positive functions on non memorable riman varieties of some special species consider the triples si d 2 i fi where i 1 k si compact rimanovo diversity without a edge d 2 i metric on si fi positive smooth function on si variety d will be called a simple crossed work of order k if d isometrically direct work r 0 inous s 1 sk with a metric ds 2 k i 1 f 2 i i dr 2 k i 1 q 2 i r j 6 i f 2 j j d 2 i diversity representable in the form of b d 1 d 2 dp where b is the compact and di are simple crossed works we will call quasi making varieties we will say that d is l stringed with a hyperbolic crossed work of order k s if for any function c s and any continuous on s function s 1 k on d there is a solution to the equation 1 such that u r 0 and limr r s 1 k we will say that d is a l hyperbolic crossed work if for any function c s and any constant c to d there is a solution to equation 1 such that u r 0 and limr u r c 158
