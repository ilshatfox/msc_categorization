the reverse edge task for the wing profile located near the rectilinear screen r b salimov 1 t yu gorskaya 2 1 salimov rsb gmail com kazan state architectural and construction university 2 tatyana gorskaya mail ru kazan state architectural and construction university considers the reverse regional task for the wing profile located near the solid rectilinear border and streamlined by the stream of fluid inconvenient with the velocity at the infinity parallel to the specified border it is required to determine the shape and position of the wing profile according to the distribution of the velocity potential as a distribution of the velocity as a function of the profile point a given velocity value in the front edge of the profile and a given difference in the function of the function on the profile and on the rectangular boundary or the value associated with the indicated difference keywords reverse edge task wing profile inconsistent inhuman liquid comprehensive potential let the wing profile lz located in the plane of the complex variable z x i y are stuck on the established stream of fluid unexpressed inanimate limited by the straight line y p p const 0 and that has an infinity equal to vurba vinger 0 we take that the back of the lz profile has an abscess x 0 d is the lz profile point the most remote from the imaginary axis with the well known abscissa xd 0 and the abscesses of all other points lz satisfy the ratio 0 x xd we assume that the flux a branch point is located on the lower surface of lz we denote its abscissa x xa we denote through the arc abscissa the lz point counted from the stream a branching point on the lz profile in a positive direction in which the course of the current remains on the right let w z i the complex potential of the current around lz designing through the v speed module at point z through the the angle of inclination of this speed to the real axis we will have w z ve ia the course of the current denote dz we take that 0 on the straight line y p q const 0 on the profile lz on the arc adb profile lz we have v on the rest of the profile s v we will assume that at the velocity potential point the value of ising pper pper lling a point z of the vel podlor proopter covers its value at point b denominates onic believing that the uction on the adb section lz is a continuous function from s if the ll speed potential on the ab section of the lower surface of the profile is a continuous function from s then in this area with a decrease s ffic increases from zero to point b which is denoted by wor the difference of the exam con is the circulation of speed v according to the profile lz we assume that 0 322 materials of the international school conference on the specified part b a of the lower surface of the lz profile we select the point n in which the 8 lus 2 and in the future we assume that the velocity potential of the profile is a continuous function from s everywhere except point n with abscissa xn and when it is bypassed lz in a positive direction starting from point n is increased by an increment equal to worb 2 2 as shown in the book 1 p 97 105 if the lz circuit is unknown the distribution of the speed value v v s 0 s l where l is the perimeter of the contour lz and it is required to find it the form then this task is allowed only when fulfilling the conditions of resolution the conditions of isolation of the lz contour the above is true for the lz profile located near the screen methods of overcoming the difficulties arising in this case and a detailed review of work on this problem are set out in the book 2 in connection with the above it seems appropriate to consider the tasks of determining the form of the lz profile which are permitted as such a task we consider the following believing that the lz profile is streamlined by the above stream with a straightforward border it is required to find the shape of the lz profile the position of the straight line of the y p i e the number p and the speed of the unperturbed flow vift if the distribution of the ll ll potential is set on lz as the function of the abscess x of the profile point lz in the form x 0 x xd on the upper surface ship ll x 0 x xd on the lower surface 1 and onic 0 onic 0 worb xn 0 2 ip xa 0 xn 0 worb 2 onic xd xd here worb a xa xn xd are known numbers in addition the value of the velocity is vd v x xd at the point d of the profile lz and the above number q we assume that x x differentiated functions the derivatives of which satisfies the condition of helder in the interval 0 xd and in the vicinity of the point x xd for the above derivatives the representation x x x xd x 1 2 xd 0 similarly as done in 1 p 97 105 it is advisable to assume that the derivatives x are set and then the values x are calculated when setting the values of these derivatives we take into account that for points lz the ratio v cos is true if the desired lz contour is sufficient in shape
