the hardi littlwood theorem and palei inequality for the rows of furye haara is well known for the hardi littlewood theorem 1 for trigonometric rows let 1 p mm f k 0 ak cos kx if ak gerk 0 is a monotonously non growing sequence then in order to f lp 0 it is necessary and enough to ensure that a row k 0 kp 2 apk converges 1 there is 2 an analogue of this theorem for monotonous functions if f is monotonous and f k 0 ak cos kx then in order to f lp 0 it is necessary and enough for a row 1 to converge as can be seen from these results the conditions for belonging to the lp space for monotonous functions and functions with monotonous coefficients coincide this is the convergence of a series 1 for the rows according to the haara system there is a different situation p l ulyanov in the work 3 proved that if the factors of furye haara ck are monotonous then in order for the function f to belong to 24 lp space 0 1 with 1 p aged it is necessary that ck k 1 l 2 i e to converge a row k 1 ck 2 theorem 1 let k inous 1 haara system 1 p mm f imes k 1 ck k if f x is a monotonous function then in order to f lpq it is necessary and enough for a row ughter k 0 2 k 1 2 1 p q sup 2 k 2 k 1 c q 1 q the next theorem establishes inequalities which are analogues of palei inequalities 1 theorem 2 let k x k 1 haara system f ger k 1 ck k x k 1 2 k 2 k 1 2 k 1 ca k 1 u uk 2 k 2 max 2 k 1 2 k c inous k 1 a if 1 p 2 p p p 1 and f lp 0 1 then the inequality q c f f lpq 0 1 is true b if p 2 u lp q then f lpq 0 1 and the inequality f lpq 0 1 c u lp q is true l and t r a t r a 1 sigmund a trigonometric rows t 2 m mir 1965 537 p 2 boas r p jr inregrability theorems transforms ergebnisse der mathematik und ihrer grezgebiete bd 38 new york springer verlag 1966 25
