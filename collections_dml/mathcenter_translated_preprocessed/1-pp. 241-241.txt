some tasks for the emden fauler equation and short o i samara state university by emden fauler s equation uef by a new different different different equation of the 2 nd order in y bxm lyn o x it has a number of physical applications for example is used in nia physics for example in astrophysics etc from a mathematical point of view it is also interesting it is a non linear equation with the resolution of the yami the behavior of which can be determined with amazing accuracy despite the fact that they generally speaking cannot be obtained in an explicit form 1 the question of the exact decisions of the uef its group properties as well as the leading to the autonomous form was investigated in 2 in this work the following tasks are considered with the regional and on cuper conditions 1 the thomas fermi equation x 112 u u 312 with the conditions with the conditions y o 1 limzh 4 ooy x o 20 n 1 y y p 2 u 0 y l 0 jy o j oo 1 5 p 2 i z 0 u y y 3 o y l o iy o i oo 40 u n 1 y jyj p 2 y o o x 1 y o 1 jy l i oo p 5 line equation mdeno at y yn o with conditions u o 1 y o o 6 in n 1 y iyl p 2 y o y o a o y o o p 2 70 u n 1 y n y 3 y o a o y o o using the runge kutt method and the final method implemented in the thrbo pascal 5 0 as well as the mathematica package it was possible to get a solution to these problems the work was supported by the russian foundation of total research the code of project 96 01 01997 241
