kalmanovich 2 1 v 572264 yandex ru kaluga state university named after k e tsiolkovsky 2 v 572264 yandex ru kaluga state university named after k e tsiolkovsky in the article is given an algorithm for the solution of the third type of thermal conductivity formulated in the most general form for the multilayer environment based on this algorithm the method of solving the problem of finding the coordinates of the phase boundary in one of the layers under general conditions on external borders is described key words matrix method thermal conductivity equation multilayer environment phase transition multilayer materials in the form of plates shells screens find more and more use in construction and equipment they are exposed to external thermal influences and are often in extreme conditions the study of thermal modes in the multilayer shell allows you to predict the behavior of individual layers and identify the conditions for the possibility of deformation melting and other changes in the physical or chemical nature of individual layers to do this you need to have good calculating methods that allow you to predict possible undesirable phenomena as such a method the matrix method that we proposed in a number of works is suitable in a number of works using the apparatus of generalized degrees of bers 5 6 let the multilayer environment consists of n flat suspicimimetric or layers with central symmetry we will direct the x axis perpendicular to the boundaries of the layers the coordinates of which are denoted by x 1 x 2 xn 1 and x 1 and xn 1 the boundaries of the entire layer system consider the stationary one dimensional process of the heat transfer directed along the x axis and described by the system of equations d d x i x xp dt i d x 0 xi x xi 1 n 1 n 1 and the conditions for coordination at the boundaries of contact of the layers t i xi 1 t i 1 xi 1 2 i xi 1 dt i d x xi 1 i 1 xi 1 dt i 1 d x xi 1 3 here t i and i respectively the temperature and coefficient of thermal conductivity in the i th layer the xp multiplier takes into account the possible curvatures of the layer p 0 corresponds to the flat layers p 1 with cooked hollow cylindrical shells p 2 concentric hollow spherical shells the layer number coincides with the number of its smaller coordinate yu a gladyshev v v kalmanovich 115 stream in the i th layer j i x i xp dt i d x 4 on the external boundaries of the layer system we set the conditions of the third type m 1 t 1 x 1 n 1 j 1 x 1 tvn x 1 5 m 2 t n xn 1 n 2 j n xn 1 tvn xn 1 6 further to solve the problem the matrix method was used together with the apparatus of generalized degrees of bers enter matrix v 1 x 1 t 1 x 1 j 1 x 1 v i x t i x j i x 7 vvn x 1 tvn x 1 jvn x 1 vvn xn 1 tvn xn 1 jvn xn 1 8 l m 1 n 1 0 1 r m 2 n 2 0 1 9 k i 1 x x 1 1 xi x xi i 1 j 1 x j x j 1 x j 0 1 10 where the functions of the type xi x xi x j x j 1 x j are generalized degrees of bersa and them the amount in the matrix to a physical point of view represents the sum of thermal resistance of the sequentially connected layers the solution for the i th layer has the form v i x k i 1 x x 1 v x 1 xi x xi 1 11 the output of formula 11 is presented in 1 moreover according to the boundary conditions 5 and 6 vvn x 1 lv 1 x 1 vvn xn 1 rv n xn 1 12 where will we get vvn 12 xn 1 rk n 1 x x 1 l 1 vvn x 1 13 thus a system of two linear equations is obtained connecting tvn x 1 tvn xn 1 jvn x 1 jvn xn 1 and by any known pair of these values the values can be determined by the values another unknown couple for example if tvn x 1 tvn xn 1 are known then from 13 you can find jvn x 1 jvn xn 1 formulas 11 13 make it possible to find a point of possible phase transition if we assume that the phase transition point xf is in the i th layer then this layer by point xf is divided into a model into two layers thus the number of layers in the system increases to n 1 having overthrown the layers in connection with this we get that the desired point of the phase transition will be xi 1 and the last point is xn 2 we solve the resulting problem according to the proposed algorithm and since it is fair at 116 materials of the school conference of any final number of layers by applying it we get a solution to the regional problem expressed through the unknown parameter xf xi 1 then we find the value of the xf point at the temperature of the phase transition tf that is from the equation t xi 1 tf according to the general theory of behavior of the solution of a homogeneous system type 1 the desired point xf provided that tv x 1 tf tv xn 1 there is and the only one the further stage of the solution is a mathematical study whether this point lies in the interval xi xi 1 under the simplest boundary conditions this problem was solved in 7 the work was carried out with financial support for the russian fund for fundamental research project
