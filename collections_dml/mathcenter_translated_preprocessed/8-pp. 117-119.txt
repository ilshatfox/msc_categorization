the solution of the singular integral equation with comprehensive consolidated unknown descent methods we consider the singular integral equation a t onic t b t onic t c t s t d t s ur t f 1 t 1 where siron t 1 i onic is the circle of a single radius with the center at the beginning of the coordinates 117 to the equation 1 add the equation comprehensive to it a t onic t b t onic t c t s t d t s accord t f 1 t 2 we denote as in 1 x 1 t onic t x 2 t onic t then equations 1 and 2 can be considered as a system of singular integral equations kx t a t x t b t sx t thx t f t where x t vector function with components x 1 t x 2 t f t vector f 1 t f 1 t a t b t dimensional matrices 2 thx t is a completely continuous part the exact appearance of which is brought to 1 it is shown that taking into account the specifics of the vector x t the operator k is symmetrical and the ax t a t x t operator for re a 0 and re 2 b t 2 is 2 monotonous in mihlin 3 denote min re re a 2 b 2 if c d where the norm is taken in c then the operator k is also monotonous and the solution of the equation 1 onic t x 1 t x 2 t 2 is the method of the most important descent by minimizing the functionality f x kx x 2 re f x the rate of convergence of the method is estimated 4 depending on the difference m m c d where m m is the largest smallest own value of the operator k in the case of arbitrary coefficients of the equation 1 as a minimized functionality you can take x ax 1 bx 2 csx 1 dsx 2 th 1 x 2 f 1 in the latter case a convergence assessment can be obtained from the general convergence of the method of the smallest squares 3 l and t r a 1 kadushin v p to direct methods for solving one class of singular integral equations izv universities mathematics 1976 no 2 c 109 111 118 2 kadushin v p to the approximate solution of the singular integral equations with comprehensive consolidated unknown and monotonous operators in sat design theory of functions and functions analysis kazan publishing house of ksu 1990 c 36 44 3 mikhlin s g variation methods in mathematical physics m nauka 1970 512 p 4 bakhlov n s numerical methods m science 1973 631 p a v kazantsev kazan flea derivatives with blokhov pre vartsanians the main strategy for the study of many holomorphic and local single leafy in the circle e 1 functions f with the only extremum of the flea derivative 1 2 f it is to study the properties of diving a in various functional classes the properties of three of these dives are discussed 1 display that compares the function f of its schwartz derivative sf f f 2 2 where f f f pre jets 2 identical immersion a into the space of the holomorphic functions with an uniform topology convergence on compacts and 3 immersion f 7 f into the space of the flea with the prenature f b submar 1 2 f in particular the theorem is fair if the holomorphic in e function f satisfies the condition f f b 2 then f a the set a identified with its image when immersed in b is absorbing but is neither balanced even in the case of f 0 0 nor star shaped however when limited to subspace b f b f 0 0 the set a b acquires starship the justification of which develops the technique of parametric families from 1 which allows us to describe 0 and in terms of the functionality of mingkovsky for a so 0 bf f s 1 and b b f 119
