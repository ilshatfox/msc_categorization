closed holomorphic functions closed by the windows which allowed the local description the introduction uses terminology from 1 2 according to functional analysis from 3 everywhere further is the area on the complex plane c h the space of all holomorphic functions p h some separated by a local convex space above the field c further called simply space if the space p is the topological module over the ring of polynomials c z z c that is multiplication by an independent variable z continuously by p then for brevity we call p just a module further everywhere under the sequence in is understood as an empty final or endless sequence of the type n where n 1 2 which does not have maximum points in for the subsidence b through b n b 1 we denote the number of points of the sequence that fell into b the function the division of the sequence relations and operations for sequences are determined respectively through the integrity relations and operations 6 inf for their divisions submissions corresponding work of an empty set of elements is zero respectively 1 for a non equal function f 6 0 from h the sequence of all roots of the function f translated taking into account the multiplicity we denote zf the subspace of the i module p is a winding over c z the term z invariant or subspace is also common invariant relative to the shift 4 5 or then just a windows if for any p c z and f p we have 280 pf i for a submodule i p we consider zi f f the sequence of zeros of the perodul i the space p is stable if for any function f p and the point c of the condition f z z z z z z z z h follows f z z p the sequences are compared in the module p the special diligence of the type i f p zf obviously if p is a stable module and i non equal dwelling i e i 6 0 then zi the dwelling of the i module p admits a local description or in terminology 1 2 is plentiful if i i zi abundant durles and their properties play an important role in the spectral theory of operators and often find themselves a decisive factor usually in a dual production in the tasks of spectral analysis synthesis interpolation in studies of the equations of packages in the issues of weighted appendix with polynomials exponential functions etc see introduction to 1 2 and reviews 4 5 the closed windows i p topologically is generated by the i 1 submodules in if i is a closure of many elements of the type i 1 in where i 1 i 1 in in we designate such a suburbs as i 1 in the closed windows of the i module p topologically is generated by the functions of the g 1 gn i if it coincides with the closure of the many elements of the type p 1 g 1 pngn where p 1 pn c z at the same time the suburbs of i is called topologically norporiental based on software research i f krasichkova ternovsky 1 2 the tasks of the local description of the closed windows in the spaces of the holomorphic functions of one variable in this article are given sufficient conditions under which the closed windows i i 1 i 2 generated by a pair of abundant windows i 1 and i 2 and i 2 also abundant these conditions are formulated in the terms of the proximity of the sequences of zeros of the i 1 and i 2 undergraduates for a wide class of modules p set as an inductive or projective limit of normalized weight spaces the setting of the problem under consideration and the terms in which it is solved also proceed from i f krasichkovaterenovsky of the and apparently the first conditions of this kind we note the recent results of n f abuzyarova 6 3 8 where for 2 periodic trigonometrically convex see 9 a half abede of the function h 0 r for modules of whole functions h with 0 corresponding to h with 1 with an indicator in order strictly smaller h corresponding to no less h 0 2 sufficient the conditions for the proximity of sequences of the roots of two whole functions in which the closed windows generated by these two functions is plentiful 281 1 the formulation of the main result is introduced into consideration of the weight modules of the holomorphic in the field of of functions set as an inductive or projective limit of normalized spaces such spaces after an appropriate integral transformation often act as the implementation of conjugated spaces to the weight spaces of the holomorphic functions in areas in c or to the spaces of functions on intervals in r let q a materially digit function in through pq we denote a normalized space consisting of all functions f h with the final norm f sup p exp q 1 1 let q qn n n an increasing comprehensive decreasing sequence of materially digit functions to enter the locally convex space p q n 1 pqn corresponding to q n 1 p
