classification of the algebrus of the galonomy of the lorentsev diversity a s galaev saratov state university rector ssgu ssu runnet ru classification of the algebra of the riman diversity of the riman diversity agrm is a well known classical result 1 this work sets out the classification of the algebra of the hydronomy of the lorentsev diversity aglm the algebra of the n 2 dimensional diversity of diversity can be identified with the gaggra g so 1 n 1 n 0 the theorem s wu and the results of m bergeta 1 allow us to consider only poorly irrelevant which are not irrelevant ch aglm g so 1 n 1 all such algebra g does not have its own invariant unbearable subspace in r 1 n 1 but has an invariant isotropic line l r 1 n 1 therefore g is found in parabolic subpassion so 1 n 1 l so 1 n 1 for podalgebras g so 1 n 1 consider the space r g r hom 2 r 1 n 1 g r u v w r v w u r w u v 0 for all u v w r 1 n 1 tensors of curvature type g determination 1 podalgebra g so 1 n 1 is called an algebra of a berge if span r 2 r 1 n 1 r r g g 35 from the ambrose zinger theorem 1 it follows that aglm is an algebra berge in 2 sn podalgebras in so 1 n 1 were divided into 4 types and with each such submarine some podalgebra h so n was associated from the works 3 and 5 it follows that the sn of the podalgebra g so 1 n 1 is an algebra of the berger and only when h so n is agrm to complete the classification of aglm it is necessary for each sn algebra berger g to build an example of lorentsev s diversity with the algebra of the gunomy g this is done in 4 where local metrics are built giving the necessary homonomies we give examples for parabolic subpal geibra 1 n 1 l so 1 n 1 we have the decomposition of ivasawa so 1 n 1 l r so n n rn sn aglm of two types have the form g 1 h r nrng 3 h onic onic a a x a h x rn where h so n agrm hom h r eed h h 0 consider the metric on rn 2 g 2 dx 0 dxn 1 n i 1 dxi 2 2 a ijkx jxk xn 1 11 dxidxn 1 f dxn 1 2 where a ijk i j k 1 n 1 n some numbers depending on h so n and f is some function for f n i 0 x i 2 corresponding f ixi xn 1 1 where the numbers wor i 1 n 1 n depend on the wor the algebra of the dull of the metric g coincides with g 1 h corresponding with g 3 h lus l and t r a t u r a 1 bessose a diversity of enshtein t 2 m peace 1990 36
