the almost periodic solutions of the main tasks of the theory of elasticity for multi layer stripes setting the problem horizontal strip h 0 s u 5 hp oo x os consisting of p uniform isotropic layers separated by straight y h 1 j 1 p 1 is located in equalization the conditions of the 1 st 2 nd or 3 rd species are set at the border of the strip and the conditions of contact strict adhesion smooth contact contact with friction are set on direct connections find the functions on the spins a j x y a j x y t v x y and movements u i x y v j x y in every layer the solution to the problem is built in the space of almost periodic functions with the help of a generalized transformation of fourier introduced and studied in 1 and 2 a method based on the use of the functions of papkovich neiber is used 3 the solution to the problem was obtained in the form of the absolutely convergent row fourier which converges absolutely and evenly the work is supported by the rffif project 01 01 00720 literature 1 kulagina m f on some endless systems with varied indices izv universities matem 1992 no 3 p 18 23 2 kulagina m f on the integrated equations in the average values in the spaces of almost periodic functions izv universities matem 1993 no 19 p 19 28 3 ufland l s integral transformations in the tasks of those elasticity of the elasticity l science 1968 406 pp k p isaev ufa bergman s space and the question of unconditional bases from the exhibits let d limited convex area on the plane and b 2 d the space of bergman space b 2 d consists of 108
