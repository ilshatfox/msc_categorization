fredholm property of the strongly singular integral operator for an inhomogeneous optical fiber e m kartchevski kazan state university the eigenvalue problem for generalized natural modes of an inhomogeneous optical fiber is formulated as a problem for the set of time harmonic maxwell s equations with the sveshnikovreichardt condition at infinity in the cross sectional plane the eigenvalues of this problem are the complex propagation constants on a logarithmic riemann surface the original problem is reduced to a strongly singular domain integral equation which is often used in practice for computation and it is proved that the operator of the domain integral equation is a fredholm operator with zero index 233 fredholm property of the strongly singular integral operator 1 introduction optical fibers are dielectric waveguides having various cross sectional shapes and where generally the refractive index of the dielectric may vary in the waveguide s cross section in recent years research on the natural modes of arbitrarily shaped dielectric waveguides has been focused on the development of efficient and reliable computational methods in many papers on numerical methods for dielectric waveguides the mathematical grounding of the method was frequently neglected however useful insight into the encountered difficulties and modal behavior has been discussed e g 1 2 the most rigorous efforts were connected with integral equation ie formulations within this class the domain ie method has the attractive advantage of being applicable to cross sectionally inhomogeneous dielectric waveguides 3 4 a problem with domain ie s is that they are strongly singular which previously prevented their use in a mathematical study of the spectrum of the eigenvalues with the exception of 5 for the purely guided modes of an inhomogeneous dielectric waveguide for real valued propagation constants it was proved in 5 that the operator of the domain ie is semi fredholm in this paper we formulate the modal eigenvalue problem as a problem for the set of time harmonic maxwell s equations with the reichardt condition at infinity in the cross sectional plane the eigenvalues of this problem are the complex propagation constants of the natural modes the original problem is reduced to a strongly singular domain integral equation similar to 3 4 5 we prove that the operator of the domain integral equation is a fredholm operator with zero index 2 statement of the problem we consider the generalized natural modes of the regular dielectric waveguide let the three dimensional space x 1 x 2 x 3 x 1 x 2 x 3 be occupied by an isotropic source free medium and let the refractive index be prescribed as a real valued function n n x 1 x 2 independent of the longitudinal coordinate x 3 and equal to a positive constant n outside a cylinder the axis of the cylinder is parallel to the x 3 axis and its cross section is a bounded 234 e m kartchevski domain on the plane ir 2 x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 denote by the unbounded domain ir 2 let the function n belong to the space of continuous functions in ir 2 the modal problem can be formulated as a vector eigenvalue problem for the set of harmonic maxwell s equations assuming that electric and magnetic field vectors have the form e x x 3 t re e x exp i x 3 i t 2 1 h x x 3 t re h x exp i x 3 i t 2 2 here x x 1 x 2 0 is the radian frequency is the complexvalued modal wavenumber or propagation constant and e and h are complex amplitudes of e and h for the fields of the form 2 1 2 2 the set of maxwell s equations become rot e i 0 h x ir 2 2 3 rot h i 0 n 2 e x ir 2 2 4 here 0 0 are the free space dielectric and magnetic constants respectively and rot e e 3 x 2 i e 2 i e 1 e 3 x 1 e 2 x 1 e 1 x 2 2 5 by c 2 ir 2 denote the space of twice continuously differentiable in ir 2 complex valued functions we shall be seeking non zero solutions e h of set 2 3 2 4 in the space c 2 ir 2 6 denote by r a circle r x ir 2 x r and by r the boundary of r definition 2 1 let r 0 be a large positive constant such that r 0 we say that functions e and h satisfy the sveshnikovreichardt condition if the functions e and h can be represented for all x ir 2 r 0 as e h l al bl h 1 l r exp il 2 6 235 fredholm property of the strongly singular integral operator where h 1 l is the hankel function of the first kind and index l r are the polar coordinates of the point x and k 2 n 2 2 the series in 2 6 should converge uniformly and absolutely definition 2 2 by denote the riemann surface of the function ln a nonzero vector e h c 2 ir 2 6 is referred to as a generalized eigenvector or eigenmode of the problem 2 3 2 4
