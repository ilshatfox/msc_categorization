differenticability of display on carno groups in various topologies and some application the purpose of the report is to discuss the concept of p radiation 58 1 of the carno groups a special class of nilpotent groups of lee which should be considered as a natural generalization of the differentiation of the eliminations of euclidean spaces this concept naturally arose in 1 in case of proof of the theorem of the type of rademacher for the lipshitsevs in the carno karateodori metrics of the carno groups further results on the p radiation of the carnos groups are established in 2 3 where the theorem on approximative differentias display of carno groups approximatically p differentiated along the horizontal vector fields has a complete approximative p radio radiolence the theorem the theorem the theorem type stepanov theorems on p roathelism of display classes of sobolev in sobolev s topology and other results as applications the results are given on the geometric theory of measures in the groups of the carno formula of area and koploshchad and the results on the geometric theory of functions in carno groups analytical definition of quasiconic display 4 etc the work was supported by the rffif and the program universities of russia l and t r a 1 pansu p m triques de carnot carath odory et quasiisom tries desespace sym triques de rang un ann of math 1989 v 119 p 1 60 2 vodop yanov s k p differentiability on carnot groups in different topologies and related topics tr by analysis and geometry editor compiler s k vodopyanov novosibirsk publishing house of the institute of mathema them s l sobolev sb ras 2000 s 603 670 3 vodopyanov s k on the differentiation of the display of the classes of sobolev in the carno group sib mat g 2001 in print 4 vodopyanov s k monotonous functions and quasiconic display in carno groups sib mat g 1996 t 37 no 6 c 1269 1295 59
