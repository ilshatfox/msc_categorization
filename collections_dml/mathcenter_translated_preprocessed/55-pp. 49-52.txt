kazan volga federal university institute of comathematics and mechanics named after n i lobachevsky in the work conducts a study of questions about the structure of the hydrodynamic power of the resistance that occurs during the periodic movement of the spherical vibration in the liquid and the influence of its various components on the process and the effectiveness of movement including the role of the hereditary resistance force in the dynamics of the robot movement is revealed excellence is carried out as part of direct numerical modeling using the openfoam software package it is shown that the hereditary component of force in the case of the final periods of movement gives a contribution to total force comparable to quasi stance its influence significantly reduces the effectiveness of the mechanism of movement for the case of high frequency oscillations keywords vibrorobot hydrodynamic resistance viscous fluid self propelled device hereditary forces the forces of the joined masses quasi stance forces the definition of hydrodynamic forces that occur during the movement of the spherical body of imperibility belongs to classical problems of hydromechanics in this paper it is considered in relation to the task of the progressive engine of 50 materials of the youth school conference of the spherical viborobot a self propelled device consisting of a solid sealed spherical body placed in a viscous fluid and a mobile internal mass that makes periodic fluctuations inside it the possibility of a directed movement of such a system rehearses the nonlinear resistance of the liquid questions about the structure the magnitude of its constituent and their influence on the movement of the viborobot are considered in this work modern models of hydrodynamic forces see e g 1 describing the effect of viscous fluid on the sphere with non stationary progressive movement are based as in the case of small reynolds numbers 2 on the release of three basic effects quasi stance resistance fst the forces of the joined masses fa and the forces of hereditary resistance fh f fst fa fh 1 the theoretical model that studies the possibilities of the viborobot movement due to quasistational resistance was presented in the work 3 under such conditions the effectiveness of the system movement in the raynolds raynolds number reav 103 could reach 7 9 where reav is the number of reynolds compared at the average speed the optimal unit of this case is the two phase periodic laws of the movement of the internal mass where the long phases of slow progressive movement on which the sphere experiences low resistance are replaced by short phases of rapid return movement allowing to return the internal cargo to the initial position due to high resistance with a minimum rollback it was these results that were chosen as the starting point in this work using numerical modeling the movement of the vibro zone according to such two phase laws of relatively painful values of the

numerical model 4 and the conforment assessment of the components of the resistance for each simulated case in accordance with 1 it was shown that the force on two segments of the acceleration see region ii in fig 1 is almost completely determined by the power of the massacers of proportional acceleration the coefficient of attached masshas is a constant ca 0 5 which is consistent with the results of many studies conducted for the sphere 5 thus the total contribution of forces on segments of acceleration of os zhuchkova a n nuriev 51 in the framework of the full period of movement is approximately equal to zero and consequently the directed movement of the viborobot is the result of forces acting on the direct and refundable phases of the movement see region i iii in fig 1 on both phases according to representation 1 in the absence of acceleration force is determined by the hereditary and quast statational components the coefficients of these forces on the phases are determined by the following formulas c d c h c st f u 2 c d c h c
