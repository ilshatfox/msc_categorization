the dual tasks of linear programming and their approximation r sh mukhutdinov kazan state university pnb ksu ru let k the field of material numbers x and x linear spaces over k if non equal bilinear functionality is x x on x x with values in k then the spaces of x and x are dual 1 let a x y linear operator x x and y y vapors of dual spaces operator a y x is called dual to a if x a y ax y x x y y in linear programming it is more convenient to use another definition operator a y x will call dual to a if x a y y ax x x y erro y let x x y y ordered linear spaces moreover the orderlies in them are agreed if x 0 then x x 0 x p x p x is a positive cone in x 104
