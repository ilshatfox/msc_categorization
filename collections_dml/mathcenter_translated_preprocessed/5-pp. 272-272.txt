for the equation of the eilera ason darbu with a strong degeneration we consider the equation iq q 1 iq and o where n men in the area of o limited characteristics ab i o sun 17 1 ad 17 o cd i 1 denote 0 1 01 q 17 02 0 11 i 17 i set 2 in the area of the lnitis function and 17 with the properties 1 and q t ec q 2 and 17 u vte continuous derivatives and and and and satisfying equation 1 in l 1 in 2 3 there are limits from the regions n i 1 2 v q lim 17 q n m u u h q 17 n m r o q i 2 q o 1 3 4 satisfies the regional conditions and o 17 sr 17 and l tj s 17 here ep 17 x ry sdated functions 4 5 the problem is solved by the method of integral equations using the solution of problems of the type of cat with the specified r 17 u 17 17 v 17 in i i 1 2 we get a two point task relative to r 11 1 as a result the theorem is proved problem d 2 has the only solution when fulfilling one perceptibility condition 272
