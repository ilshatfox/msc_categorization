the stationary and periodic regimes of natural convection in the porous environment e i kalinin a b mazo kazan state university kazan introduction numerical modeling of filtration currents in the context of gravitational stratification of fluid is currently developing intensively the calculations of natural thermal convection of liquid in containers filled with a porous environment were carried out for example in work 1 2 recently along with traditional equations of non thermal filtration more complex nonlinear models have been considered so in 3 a numerical study of the thermal constituent course based on the darcy foremer model taking into account the effect of inertia was performed in 4 natural convection in the square region with a partially open upper wall was studied through which heat transfer with the environment occurs in 5 the influence of complex heterogeneous boundary conditions for temperature on the intensity of heat transfer was investigated the article 6 considers the convective course complicated by the mismatch of the temperature of the porous skeleton and the filtering fluid the conditions for the applicability of the hypothesis of local thermal equilibrium are numerically determined in 7 a modeling of natural convection was carried out due to an uneven distribution of not only temperature but also the concentration of impurities an analysis of modern scientific literature on natural convection in a porous environment shows that in most works filtration currents in rectangular containers are studied while the effect of the geometry of the region on the features of thermal constituent processes was not studied even sufficiently within the framework of 157 stationary and periodic regimes linear models in this article the simplest mathematical model of natural convection was used to numerically study the modes of the filtration course of the fluid in the container of arbitrary form the situations are considered when with stable temperature stratification heating from above stationary vortex structures occur in the porous medium and in the case of unstable stratification of the fluid heating from the bottom the current regimen is characterized by periodic carcolines 1 the setting of the problem consider a flat container with the border and a characteristic linear size l filled with a rich porous medium fig 1 let k and m the absolute permeability and porosity of the skeleton and its thermophysical properties are set by the following parameters density c heat capacity is thermal conductivity we will use the same parameters with index f to characterize the filter fluid in addition we denote through its viscosity all properties of the liquid and the porous environment are supposed to be constant with the exception of the density of the fluid which is linearly dependent on the temperature f t 0 1 t t 1 1 1 fig 1 to setting the problem 158 e i kalinin a b mazo here 0 equilibrium density the coefficient of temperature expansion of the fluid with an uneven distribution of temperature dependence 1 1 leads to natural convection for modeling various modes of heating coeking of the walls of the container dress its border into three parts 0 with a given temperature t 0 1 with a given temperature t 1 and 2 with the conditions of thermal insulation see fig 1 we will use the caretove coordinates with a vertical axis y directed up against acceleration of gravity g and time t the basis of the mathematical model of the studied process we put the law of darcy and the bossinnes hypothesis determining equations have the form v k grad p f 0 g ey 1 2 1 m c mcf f t cf f v grad t div grad t 1 3 p g f y 1 4 hereinafter v filtration rate p deviation of pressure from hydrostatic n external to normal ex ey single orths the impermeability of the border of the container is expressed by the boundary condition of the neumann for pressure p n f 0 g sin n ex 1 5 and the above mentioned walls of the walls of the walls are set by the boundary conditions in certain areas of the border 0 t t 0 1 t t 1 1 6 2 t n 0 we bring the system of ratios 1 1 1 6 to the dimensionless form using formulas x y x y l t t t 1 t 0 t 1 f 0 0 t 0 t 1 159 stationary and periodic regimes v v v 0 v 0 k 0 t 1 g p p p 0 p 0 v 0 l k 1 7 pe v 0 l a a cf 0 s m 1 m c cf f t t t 0 t 0 l v 0 s the law of temperature expansion 1 1 in variables 1 7 takes a simple form t and after the density is excluded we come to the next formulation of the task the line above the dimensionless quantities is lowered p t y x y p n t sin n ex 1 8 vx p x vy t p y 1 9 t t v grad t 1 pe t x y 1 10 0 t 1 1 t 0 2 t n 0 instead of a task 1 8 for pressure you can consider an alternative formulation of the task by introducing the current function vx y
