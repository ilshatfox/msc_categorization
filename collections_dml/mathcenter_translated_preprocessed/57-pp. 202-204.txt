the materials of the school conference here are worth noting that the proposed parametric method is a sufficient but not necessary sign of the existence of a solution and even in such a simple case as a scalar square equation additional variation of the auxiliary operator a ai is necessary to cover all cases of the existence of a solution the simplest choice of the operator a 0 as in the work 1 is insufficient to prove the existence of a solution in case of positive discriminant therefore the proposed method gives an improvement even in this simplest case and thereby allows a sufficient sign to be made necessary and sufficient in the general case however it should be borne in mind that obtaining the necessary and sufficient features proposed by the parametric method if possible it requires preliminary knowledge of such a criterion with the further selection of auxiliary operators a covering all known cases of the criterion with a specific choice of operator a the parametric method only delivers a sufficient feature literature 1 hartman f ordinary differential equations m mir 1970 720 c 2 lobanov s g vytod vushevsky for nonlinear evolutionary equations matem notes 2008 vol 83 no 5 s 705 714 a parametric method of solving non linear equations in banach spaces a g korolev in this paper we develop a generalization of so called vazhevsky method solving non linear etces f x h keywords non linear equations parametric method udc 517 5 criterion for the completeness of the system of exponential monomas with positive indicators o a krivosheev 1 a f kuzhaev 2 1 kriolesya 2006 yandex ru bashkir state university 2 pozitiv 373 gmail com bashkir state university in the work investigates the problem of the completeness of the system of exponential monomas with positive indicators in the space of analytical functions in the convex region the criterion for the completeness of such a system has been obtained keywords a system of exposed monomas completeness convex region let k nk k 1 a multiple sequence of positive numbers o a krivosheeva a f kuzhaev 203 k k 1 k 1 k urb nk purpose put n t k t nk the upper density of the sequence is called respectively n lim t n t t and the maximum density of the sequence is called n 0 lim 0 n 0 n 0 lim t t n t 1 t 0 1 consider the system of exponential monomas e zne k z nk 1 urb n 0 k 1 our task is to investigate the problem of the completeness of the e system in the field of d c i e in the space of analytical functions in the field of d with the topology of uniform convergence on the compact subset of the region d most often the problem of completeness in the convex region is most often studied from the result of i f krasichkov ternovsky 1 theorem 8 3 it follows that subject to n the system e is not full in any unlimited convex area that contains a vertical half prince convex areas that do not have this property lie in a certain horizontal strip the criterion for the completeness of the e system in the horizontal strip was obtained by p maljaven and l rubel 2 it is formulated in terms of the logarithmic density of the sequence b n khabibullin 3 summarized this result in case of unlimited areas lying in a horizontal strip there are a number of results about the completeness of the e system in the circle see for example 4 chap iv 5 chap i 7 in the case of arbitrary limited areas b ya levin 4 chap iv theorem 21 and a f leontyev 6 independently obtained the following classic result we will formulate it for convex areas let d is a convex area the vertical diameter of the region d is called the size d d sup x sup y 1 y 2 y 1 y 2 x i y 1 x i y 2 d theorem 1 let the k nk if theratic sequence with a density n 0 then the e system is full in any convex area with a vertical diameter d d 2 and is not full in any convex area with a vertical diameter d d 2 the problem of the completeness of the e system in limited convex areas was also studied in work 7 and 8 in 8 a generalization of theorem 1 for some sequences that do not have density was obtained in one of the classes of convex areas in particular in the class of areas that have vertical or horizontal axes of symmetry 204 materials of the school conference the purpose of this work is the distribution of the result of the theorem 1 to one of the classes of sequences that do not have density theorem 2 let k nk n 0 mm the following statements are equivalent 1 the e system is incomplete in any convex area d with a vertical diameter d d 2 and is full in any convex region d with a vertical diameter d d 2 2 n the work was carried out with financial support for the grant of the russian scientific fund project no 18 11 00002 literature 1 krasichkov ternovs
