one assessment of twisted generated by the permeable wall of the f r gainulnn v l fedyaev institute of mechanics and engineering of the knc ras kazan ilgatov sci kcn r and the non stationary and stationary course of the ideal inconspicuous fluid in the channel containing a thin permeable wall are considered it is assumed that in front of the wall the movement of the liquid is potential behind it is vortex in the non stationary case it is additionally believed that at the initial moment of time the liquid rests subject to quasistacency the current at the beginning of the acceleration pressure p and p on different sides of the walls are using the bernoulli integral at the same time 1 here the coefficient of resistance w is the rate of flow p the density of the liquid we believe in addition to the fact that behind the wall the tangent component of the speed is small and in front of it du kw dt 2 where t and tangent coordinate and fluid velocity k s ln s s 1 s 0 s 1 openings area s 0 wall skeleton area ln characteristic distance by normal considering further that k lr 0 p 0 p 0 constant medium values from 1 and 2 we will find d 2 y w 2 lr 0 2 kw dt p 2 3 osr taking into account the ratings of ln and lr 0 for the speed of flow and twist on the wall we get w ricost j xsint where t tta t l x tt f v f f f 01 f a s lne l jl 0 l ri e v e wall length f 0 its projection l 0 the average value of the resistance coefficient v is the velocity of the liquid at the input to the channel 176 e parameter characterizing the attenuation of the velocity in front of the wall in the inpatient case behind the wall the pressure p is estimated by v p r p 2 wq 4 where q is the current function 5 to find w the equation dw u 2 jwd w d t o 2 6 orsye after a series of simplifications for assessing the speed of leakage we find expression 7 where 0 t a a coordinate one of the edges of the wall cr 0 5 o y a 2 q 1 cr o 1 cr q a 0 5 parameter that characterizes the tangent of the fluid velocity in front of the wall determined from the task of the flow of the impenetrable wall q is the fluid consumption through the wall q fluid consumption e 4 s s 1 s 2 s 1 s 2 s l cr sin 2 q 8 s 1 s 2 here s is the channel section at the output s 1 s 2 areas corresponding to the opening and wall q the angle of inclination to the axis of the channel from 7 it follows j u ocrea i and the obtained estimates of the rate of flow and twisting can be used further as initial approaches in numerical calculations of the flows under consideration 177
