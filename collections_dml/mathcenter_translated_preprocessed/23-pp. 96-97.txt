the regional tasks for one class of semi linear elliptical equations on riman varieties in this work are studied issues of resolving on the riman 98 varieties of some of the regional tasks for the semi linear elliptical equation u u u 1 where 0 0 a monotonously increasing continuously differentiated function at 0 mm let m complete rimano diversity represented in the form of m b d where b is a certain ancestor with a non resistant inside the border b which is a smooth submachine d isometrically direct work r 0 s where r 0 0 s compact rimanovo diversity without a edge with a metric ds 2 dr 2 g 2 r d 2 where g r 0 is smooth on r 0 inous function and d 2 is a metric on s we will say that on m resolves the task of the conductor for equation 1 in the class of positive negative functions if for any continuous positive negative on s functions there is a limited solution to this equation u x such that lim r u r we introduce the designation i ger r 0 dt gn 1 t t r 0 gn 1 dran n dim m theorem 1 the task of the conductor for the equation 1 is solved on m in the class of positive negative functions when and only when i theorem 2 for any constant a 0 a 0 on m b there are whole positive negative limited solutions u r and v r equations 1 that satisfy the regional conditions u b a u b 0 v b 0 v b a then and only when i imes in addition there are limr u r and limr ger v r the work was carried out with financial support from the russian federation project no 0301 00304 99
