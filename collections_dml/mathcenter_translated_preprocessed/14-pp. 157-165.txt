one homeomorphism between the classes of single leaf functions in the future is the class of regular and single leafy in the ring 2 z 1 functions each of which performs a conformal display of this ring to a particular double area symmetrical regarding the circumference w and moreover so that the circle z is displayed into the circle w with the preservation of orientation and the point z passes to point 163 w let s a class of regular and single leafed in a circle z 1 functions f z normalized by conditions f 0 0 f 0 1 finally if is some limited closed subset w thoroughness then it should be understood as the class of measorphic and one leafy in addition to many functions that do not accept values equal to zero and in the vicinity of an infinitely removed point decomposition i w w a 0 a 1 w a 2 w 2 where the multi flowers indicate members containing higher degrees of 1 w the next theorem is known in the literature called the torization theorems theorem 1 let the function w w z conformally displays the ring 2 z 1 to the double region d the internal component of the addition to which to the entire plane coincides with the continuum in these assumptions there is moreover the only function of the iw w from the class such that the composition lw z iw w z determined in the ring r z r analytically continues in the full circle z 1 lw 0 0 and is in this circle a regular and single leaf function for the first time the theorem on factorization and moreover in a more general form was established by v d erokhin 1 2 the theorem on factorization arose from the needs of the theory of approximation later ideas expressed by v d erokhin received development in the works of other authors see 3 5 suppose that the function v z continuously depends on the small material parameter 0 and with 0 evenly inside the ring 2 z 1 strives for some function w z let the function w w z conformally display the ring r z r on the two way area d the addition to which to the entire plane consists of a limited continuum and an unlimited continuum b we denote the conformal image of the ring 2 z through dv 1 when displayed v v z obviously dv is a double ivated area one of the two connected components of the addition of which is limited to the entire plane v and the other bv is unlimited in accordance with the theorem of factorization for the function v z at any 0 there is the only function iv v from class v for which the composition lv v iv v z determined in the ring 2 z 1 analytically continues in the full circle z 1 and is in this circle a regular and single leaf function since with 0 function v z 164 evenly inside the ring 2 z 1 strives for the w z function it is natural to expect that the functions of iv w and lv z at 0 uniformly inside their areas of the definition converge respectively to the functions iw w and lw z that meets the functions w z in the sense of the theorem 1 lemma 1 on any closed subset of additions to the continuum an uniform assessment of iv w iw w o 1 0 is performed 1 1 we have an uniform rating lv z lw z o 1 0 2 proof any closed set of f lying in addition to the continuum can be separated from this continuum of some closed hidden curve zhordan in turn and the curve can be separated from the continuum closed gordanus curve let denoting the distance between the curves and with sufficiently small 0 and any w point v v z w where z w is a function reverse for w z will lie inside 3 on open curve when the point w promises the curve point v describes some curve closed by zhordanov at 0 the curve is entirely located in 3 the surroundings of the curve and therefore inside the curve consider the closure 3 ocrests of the curve the addition to this closed surroundings of the curve consists of no more than the counting number of single link areas let u that of them that contains an infinitely remote point the complement to the area of u is a limited single copied set independent of at 0 continum v as well as curves and belong to the set as for the curve it lies in the u covering the continuum and remaining from it at a distance of no less 2 3 if necessary reduce so that with 0 and any w point v v z w lay inside 3 ocrestes of point w therefore at 0 and w between the point v v z w and the continuum are a certain positive distance no less 3 since with 0 function iv v it belongs to the class on the curve a uniform assessment iv w iv v o 1 0 3 165 and therefore with w and
