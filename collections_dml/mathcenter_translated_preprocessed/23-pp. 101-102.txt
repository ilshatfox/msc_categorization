the discreteness of the spectrum of the schr dinger operator on curved works we will consider the rimano variety z isometric work x y where x and y are arbitrary diversity of dimensions n and m respectively with metric dz 2 dx 2 2 x dy 2 where x c 1 a bit positive function dx 2 and dy 2 metric on x and y respectively such diversity zs are called curved riman works let the borelev measure are set on z we will assume that has a density z where z x y x and y c 1 cordous positive functions consider the weight diversity z and ope 103 schr dinger rator on it l div c x we need this operator to be semi boundary the poet will assume that c x k k const next we believe that the spectrum of the laplace belpami operator y on diversity y discrete we denote i y its own values avy ordered by increasing and each repeated according to its multiplicity for the wording we denote amer with the weight of m x x on diversity x then through the a 0 we denote the operator of laplace belmers on the variety of x with a measure and the schroddinger operator associated with it is through b 0 a 0 c x theorem the schr dinger operator on diversity z has a discrete spectrum and only when the spectrum of the operator b 0 1 y 2 is discrete in diversity x this theorem is a generalization of the results 1 and 2 the work was carried out with financial support from the rffif project no 03 01 00304 l and t r a 1 baider a noncompact riemannian manifolds with discrete spectra j diff geom 1979 v 14 p 41 57 2 svetlov a v the spectrum of the operator of the schr dinger on the crossed about the establishments vestnik volga series 1 mathematics physics 2002 issue 7 s 12 19 b v simonov volgograd htf vstu ru on the conditions of investing of some classes of functions let lp the space of 2 periodic functions with p 1 summarized by 0 2 f 1 2 0 f x dx or with p continuous for the entire axis f organ max xicle 0 2 f x en f p is the best approximately 104
