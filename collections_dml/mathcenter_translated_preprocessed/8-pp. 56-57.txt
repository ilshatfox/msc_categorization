space with a unitaryly generated one and a half line form in this message describes the half following and in terms of half traces probability on the hyperbolic logic of projectors let m the algebra of the neumann in the hilbert space h and let u eiison the unitary operator algebra m is called w u algebra if m r u 2 w u algebra m is called w p albro if at least one of the projectors p e 0 or p i e 0 is final relative to the let pu p m p 2 p upx y ux py x y h projector p pu is called the maximum positive maximum negative if the ph is the maximum positive maximum negative subspace relative to indepinite metric 2 p i x y x y h let p u p u a lot of all positive negative projectors in pu and p m p m are many maximum positive maximum negative projectors in pu for any p p u we denote through e p the orthopriotector on p ph each projector e pu seems not the only way in the form e e e e p u the material measure pu r is called half a trace if there are an exact normal semi inferior trace and the operator m attached to the center of the algebra is such that or p t l 1 m and then e e te e pu or p t l 1 m and then e te e pu for a factor case the weakened version of the theorem 1 formulated below was previously proved by m s matveychuk theorem 1 let pu r measure on w u algebra ple 56 blowing conditions are equivalent i is the sum of the half traces ii is constant on many maximum positive maximum negative projectors iii e p p p p u and e p p p p u theorem 2 let pu r probabilistic measure on w u algebra m type m is different from i 2 then there is a non equal component which is w p is algebra the narrowing on it is again a probability and is the sum of the half traces the work was supported by the ministry of defense of the russian federation project e 00 1 0 172 l and t r a t r a 1 matvejchuk m s semicontant measures on hyperbolic logics proc amer math soc 1997 v 125 no 1 p 245 250 e b vladova ulyanovsk some limiting theorems for measures on hyperbolic logic in this message on w the algebra are summarized by two limit theorems proven by m s matveychuk 1 2 for the case of w j factors we adhere to the designations and terminology of work 3 theorem 1 let the pu the set of all u sample projectors from semi pointed w u algebrym without a direct component type in n 4 and let n pu r sequence of indepinite measures suppose that for any projector p pu there is the final limit p lim n n p then p 0 entails p 1 n p 0 evenly by n if in addition m is the final algebra then pu r is an indepinite measure 57
