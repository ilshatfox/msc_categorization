regularization of the equations of the task of diffraction of the electromagnetic wave on the periodic lattice the task of diffraction of the electromagnetic wave on a flat periodic grate of metal tapes belongs to the key tasks of electrodynamics 1 in this work various methods of bringing the task of diffraction to endless systems of linear algebraic equations blsa are considered for which the method of truncation reduction converges this means that starting with some order of truncation all the final slaus are unambiguously permitted and the sequence of close decisions of blsa built according to their decisions converges to the exact solution it is shown that the equivalent task of diffraction by a paired summary equation can be transformed using a special integral identity so that designing on a system of basic functions gives regular bsrau at the same time the regulatory identity is a condition that connects the boundary functions in the reduced task of the cosse for the helmholtz equation in the half plate in a periodic case finally the galerkin method leads the singular integral equation siu with a logarithmic feature in the nucleus equivalent to the summary equation to exactly the same truncated bsra 233 10 let the l periodic grill consisting of endlessly thin and perfectly conducting metal tapes parallel to the x parallel x fingers is located in the plane of the xy we denote through m many points of the interval 0 l located inside the tapes and through n all the internal points of the remaining part of the interval let a flat electromagnetic wave which is determined by the potential function u 0 y z e igz falls on top z 0 you need to find a field that occurs in the process of diffraction we will look for the potential functions of the field above the lattice and under the grille in the form of u y z ger n least ane nzei ny z 0 1 u y z nder n n n n least i nzei ny z 0 1 where 2 l and n k 2 n 2 n l k 2 n 2 n l i n 2 k 2 the theorem 1 the task of differentias of the flat wave on the periodic grill is equivalent to the paired summary equation n least ane ny 1 nder n least an ne ny 0 y is equivalent n 2 3 we denote ik m ei k d k 0 1 jk n ei kydy l 0 ei kydy ik k 0 l k 6 0 0 ik 234 having designed equation 2 3 on the exp i my functions system m 0 1 which is tantamount to equating the factors of the fourier of the left and right parts we get blance l mam n least 1 n in m i m m 0 1 it is easy to check that the sequence of its close solutions found by the method of truncation does not converge to regulate the equation 2 3 and similar equations the method of the problem of riman gilbert or the semi security method was proposed see 1 it is based on the fact that it is possible to build a clear solution of the paired equation n least ane i ny 1 y m ger n urb an n ei ny 0 y n we note we note that the calculated formulas of this method are significantly complicated if not one tape is located in the band of the lattice but several tapes lemma 1 if k 1 y 1 l m happ 1 m ei m y then ger n least ane i ny l 0 ger n an ne i n k 1 y d y 0 l 4 indeed from the orthogonality of the system the exponent on 0 l follows that the integral operator with the core k 1 y has its own exp i ny functions that correspond to its own values 1 n n 0 1 it is assumed that a number of fourier in the left part 4 converges 235 theorem 2 the task of diffraction of a flat wave on the periodic grille is equivalent to blanu l ak 1 l ger n char ger m least 1 m in mjm k i k 0 k 0 1 5 proof from 3 and identity 4 it follows that with y n ger n least ane i ny 1 l ger n urb an n ger m et me i my 0 6 equalizing the coefficients of fourier and the right parts of paired equality 2 6 we get 5 20 consider the task of the koshi for the helmholtz equation with the material coefficient in the half plane z 0 following the work 2 we will look for solutions to the equation 2 u y 2 2 u z 2 k 2 u y z 0 7 in the class of sobolev distributions generalized functions of slow growth at infinity we agree to distinguish between the distributions and their images of fourier by arguments believing that when converting fourier variables y z are replaced by solving u y z equations 7 will call the line z 0 in half a fluidity z 0 if u y z is the distribution of slow growth supp u y z z 0 and sing supp u 0 8 the field dependence on time in the form of exp i t is chosen let k i 2 k 2 k k 2 2 lemma 2 solution u y z equations 7 belongs to the class coming from the straight line z 0 into the halfness z 0 decisions and satisfies the boundary conditions u y 0 u 0 y u z y 0 u 1 y y r 1 9 236 and only when the images of the fourier of the boundary distributions of bonds
