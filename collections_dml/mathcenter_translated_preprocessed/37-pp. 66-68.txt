the numerical solution to the problem of the flow of the system of bodies in the variables current function turpect is considered the task of streaming the system of bodies with a viscous laminated fluid flow we describe the course of the system of equations of navier stake in the variables the function of the current vortex t v 1 re 4 1 67 vx y vy x 4 2 on each of the streamlined contours i the conditions of adhesion and non treatment are recorded as n 0 ci t 3 in this case the first of the conditions 3 is used to determine the boundary conditions for 1 to determine the unknown constants ci we use the condition for the continuity of pressure on the contours 2 p i p s ds 1 re n ds 0 4 on each time layer task 1 2 was decided in the following order 1 the definition from the poisson equation 2 with the boundary conditions of the conductor 2 determination of the boundary values from the solution of equation 2 with the boundary conditions of the neumann 3 the solution of the equation of the transfer of twisted 1 since the value of the current function on the circuit satisfying the condition 4 is unknown in advance we will introduce all hydrodynamic functions as linear from ci after the mke approximication of poisson taking into account the boundary conditions of the conductor we will come to the system of equations s f we single out the components containing unknown ci in separate columns fi on the right side then due to linearity s it is possible to write s 1 f 0 i s 1 fi ci 0 i i ci using the found 0 i in the second step we determine the boundary values and in the third the fields of twist 0 i 68 which in the conditions 4 we come to the system of equations to determine the unknown constants i 0 n ds j i j n ds cj 0 we use the found ci to finally determine the fields of twist and current function on the layer as an example of the use of the described algorithm we consider the course around three circular cylinders of different radius with the number of reynolds relatively smaller of them re 200 in fig 1 shows the current lines at the time t 200 and the dependence of the constant ci on time it can be seen that the current is of a carcolor in nature rice 1 l and t e r a t r a 1 mazo a b dautov r z on the boundary conditions for the navier stox equations in the variables of the current function swirling when modeling the flow of the tel system ifzh 2005 v 78 no 2 c 75 79 2 jian guo liu cheng wang high order finite methods for unsteady incompressible flows in multi connected domains computers fluids 2004 v 33 no 2 p 223255
