compactness conditions in the spaces l i n katkovskaya v g krotov in this paper we give criteria for the compactness of sets in the spaces l consisting of equivalence classes of measurable functions f for which the composite f is summable on ametric space x with a measure that satisfies the doubling condition here r r is an even function positive continous and increasing on 0 urb and onic 0 0 limt ger peace t urb in addition it is assumed that satispies the orlicz 2 condition the compactness criteria are formulated in terms of maximal operators measoring the local smoothness keywords dubling condition compactness spaces of summable functions maximal operators local smoothness udc 517 5 problem on the arc for analytical functions b a kats 1 s r mironov 2 a yu pogodina 3 1 katsboris 877 gmail com kazan volga federal university 2 srmironova yandex ru kazan national research technical university named after a n tupoleva kai 3 apogodina yandex ru kazan national research technical university named after a n tupoleva cai imracking the regional task of a jump in the najordane arc and look for a solution in the class of functions that are analytical functions keywords beltra equation the edge of the leap task analytical functions 182 materials of the international school conference consider the equation by the underwear z 1 where 1 2 x i y 1 2 x i y it is a generalization of the equation of koshha riman 0 and has a large number of applications see e g 1 3 in 1985 a b tungatarov 4 investigated this equation at z z z 0 1 and established the following analogue of the cat formula for the solutions of this equation z 1 2 1 i d z z 2 1 d z z where 2 2 1 is a closed smooth curve that limits a certain flat area then in articles 5 9 regional tasks were studied for continuously differentiated solutions of this equation called analytical functions the task of the jump and the task of riman on closed curves were solved here we are studying the task of a jump for analytical functions on the jordan arches let oriented smooth arc starting at point t 1 and ending at point t 2 t 1 t 2 and 0 we are looking for the analytical function z such that at each point t it has the limiting values on the left and right satisfying the ratio t t f t t 1 with a given function f t in addition it is required that the company 0 and at the end points of the arc the ratio z o z t j j z t j j j 1 j 1 2 2 for the case 0 the task of jumping on smooth arcs has been studied and its solution is well known see e g 10 11 the main apparatus here is an integral of the koshi type in this work we use its analogue z c f z 1 2 1 i f z z d d 3 such an integral taken by a closed curve was studied in 5 7 we note some properties of integral in 3 lemma 1 if the integral in 3 exists then the right part of this equality determines the analytical function in c which turns into zero at infinity we denote the class of functions through ha that satisfy the condition of the helder with the indicator 0 1 b a katz s r mironova a yu pogodin 183 lemma 2 if the function f t t ha then the function determined by equality 3 has the ultimate values on the left and right t at any point t satisfying equality 1 note that the display z 7 z z is mutually unambiguous it is bilipshitsevo on each compact subservience of the plane not containing the beginning of the coordinates we denote through the image of the arc while display lemma 3 if the function of f t ha then in the vicinity of the end of the ar columns determined in 3 has the following behavior z f t j 2 1 i ln z t 2 z t 1 c j o 1 j 1 2 where c j constants and the logarithm branch is determined by a section along based on lemm 1 3 theorem is proved function tail z c f z is the only solution to the task of leap 1 2 on the smooth arc that satisfying the equation of the underwear z z and turning to zero at infinity the work of the first author was supported by grant rff no 17 41 160345 literature 1 union i n generalized analytical functions moscow science 1988 2 bojarski b old and new on beltrami equations functional analytic methods in complex analysis and applications to partial differential equations proc of the ictp conference trieste italy feb 8 19 1988 3 iwaniec t martin g what s new for the beltrami equation proc of the national research symposium on geometric analysis and appls june 26 30 2000 canberra proc center math appl 2000 v 39 p 132 148 4 tungatarov a b properties of certain integral
