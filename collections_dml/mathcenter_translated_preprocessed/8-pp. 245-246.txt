invariant reduction of branching equations in real banach spaces e 1 e 2 the following bifurcation point problem is considered b x r x r 0 0 0 r 0 0 1 here b d b e 1 e 2 is a closed linear fredholm operator with dense in e 1 domain d b n b span 1 n n b span 1 n j n 1 e 1 and zj n 1 e 2 are corresponding biorthogonal systems the terminology and notation from 1 3 are used it is supposed that 1 admits a l parametrical continuos group g a a a 1 al d rl and a discrete group g 1 i e it is invariant with respect to g a g 1 g the subspace e n 1 is invariant with respect to l a condition i in coordinate representations in en 1 n b and n b the matrices representations ag and bg arise and the branching equation beq corresponding to 1 is invariant with respect to ag and bg t ag bgt the beq is called potential if the equality f d grad u holds with a nonsingular matrix d theorem 1 the potential u of the g invariant beq is an invariant of ag if a gdbg d in fact for ag we have du u d u d d 1 t d condition ii let l a be a l parametric continuous group e 1 acting l 1 optimally in n b it means that there exists a basis i n 1 245 in n b such that for any fixed n 1 k k n b we can find an a d and constants r 1 rl 1 n l 1 l such that l a l 1 1 rj j the functions rk are 1 homogeneous invariants of a a condition ii implies an invariant reduction of the beq to l 1 n or l 1 l 1 systems in the last case we say about truncation reduction tr the tr is possible under potentiality conditions of the beq but sometimes it takes place on its partial potentiality see the lowest degeneracy cases in the problems about capillary gravity surface waves and crystallization in statistical crystal theory 2 in this connection under beq reduction realizability the bifurcation point existence theorem is proved some connections between partial potentiality of beq and tr possibility are discussed and on the base of these results iterational methods are suggested our further activity in this direction is divoted to investigation of potentiality problems for resolving systems in bifurcation theory our results are supported by rfbr grant 0101 0019 r e f e r e n c e s 1 vainberg m m trenogin v a branching theory of solutions of nonlinear equations moskow nauka 1969 542 p 2 loginov b v branching theory of solutions of nonlinear equations under group invariance conditions tashkent fan 1985 184 p 3 loginov b v branching of solutions of nonlinear equations and group symmetry vestnik samara univ 1998 no 2 8 p 15 75 246
