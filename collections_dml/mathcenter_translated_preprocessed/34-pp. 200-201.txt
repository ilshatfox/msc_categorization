multi digit dynamic systems with libra of p i troshin kazan state university troshin hitv ru in this paper we propose to consider m digit m n transformation of the probabilistic space x b which can be represented as a union 1 digit transformations s x m j 1 sj x we equip this transformation with a set of measurable functions worts j x 0 1 mj 1 with the property m j 1 j x 1 four x b s we will call many valid dynamic a system with weights we give analogues of concepts and theorems from the ergodic theory of 1 digit dynamic systems see 1 namely a new measure on b s b m j 1 s 1 j b j x d operator of the kupman uf x m j 1 j x f sj x the operator of the frobenius the platform p l 1 x b l 1 x b set by the equation b pf d m j 1 s 1 j b j x f x d and the concept of ergodism s when f l 1 g lius lim n mit 1 n 1 k 0 x p kf x g x d x f d x g d 202 we have the ability to achieve the conditions of preservation of the measure s and ergodicity s using the choice of weights j mj 1 some generalization of the results in 2 among the others we have proved the following main facts 1 u lp compression on lp and u l 1 markov operator 2 if s then f lp p mm f lp lim n 1 n 1 k 0 ukf f lp 0 3 if f l 1 and g lear then x pf g d x f ug d 4 if f l 1 1 f 0 then pf f then and only when s retains the measure b b f d 5 if s is ergodic then ug g g lear and only when g is constant 6 if f l 1 lim n p nf x f d l 1 0 then s ergodic l and t r a t r a lasota a mackey m chaos fractals and noise appl math sci 1994 v 97 springer werlag new york 2 igudesman k b dynamics of finite multivalved transformma tions lobachevskii j of mathematics 2005 v 17 p 47 60 203
