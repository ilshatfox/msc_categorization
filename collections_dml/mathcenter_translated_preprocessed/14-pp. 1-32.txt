scientific seminar in the geometric theory of functions the main results of the last two decades in 2002 have been 40 years since the founding of a scientific seminar in the geometric theory of the functions of a complex alternating at kazan state university ksu the seminar combines mathematicians developing the problems of the geometric theory of the functions of complex alternating direct and reverse marginal tasks for analytical functions and their applications in the mechanics of solid media it was created in 1962 as an optional student seminar and later became a creative association of mathematicians from various universities of kazan the seminar first acted at the department of differential equations and from 1978 to the present works at the department of mathematical analysis of the mechanical and mathematics faculty of ksu his permanent leader is the honored worker of science of the republic of tatarstan doctor of physical and mathematical sciences professor l a aksentiev through its participants the seminar has always actively interacted with other scientific groups subsidiaries in relation to the city seminar regional tasks and their applications the leaders of the latter for many years have been professor m t juzhin g g tumashev and l i chibrikova so f g avhadiev a m elizarov and s r nasyrov were permanent active participants in the seminar in the departure of the regional tasks of the research institute of mathematics and mechanics nimm named after n g chebotarev ksu led by professor n b ilyinsky professor r b salimov kazan state architectural and construction academy and his students v v seleznev m l slavutin e v strezhnev n k tuktamyshev and others repeatedly performed at the seminar of l a aksentieva in the nimm a seminar works under the leadership of f g avhadiev a number of reports and dissertation studies were discussed at joint meetings of two seminars the seminar contributed to the creation of a scientific team which is engaged in research on comprehensive analysis and its applications today the kazan part of this team is concentrated mainly in universities professor l a aksentiev f g avhadiev a m elizarov and s r nasrov

the editions of the results of science and technology vinity 13 64 as well as in monographs 6 65 66 146 since the beginning of the 90 s of the last century summer all russian schools conference schools on the theory of functions have been regularly held in kazan see for example 32 33 41 67 68 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 69 121 122 123 in the organization of which the seminar members take an active part we describe the main achievements of a number of mathematicians grown up at the seminar and continuing active mathematical creativity over the past two decades since kazan is a leading center in russia for research in the field of sufficient conditions of one legged we will start with this direction 1 the conditions of one leafness of analytical functions and their generalizations assessments for analytical and harmonic functions 1 1 application of the parametric method and quasiconic continuity in the theory of single leafful functions one of the most effective is the parametric method of levner kufarev which is based on the possibility of representing an arbitrary one leaved conformal display through the solutions to the koshu problem for the non linear equation of levner kufarev with the right part the material part of which is positive this gave a fundamentally new approach to the study of geometric and extreme properties of single leafy analytical functions on the other hand the levner kufarev equation generates the evolutionary families of nested areas which made it possible to approach the decision of the act in a new point of view
