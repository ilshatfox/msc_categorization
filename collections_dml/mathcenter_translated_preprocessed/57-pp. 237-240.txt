one analogue of the reverse theory of the theory of approximation relative to the flat measure v p misyuk 1 1 misiuk grsu by grodno state university named after yankees kupala grodno belarus considered the question of one analogue of the theorem such as bernstein theory of rational approximation in the event of a flat measure of the lebag key words the best rational approximation inequality such as bernstein reverse theorems the space of hard besov let m 2 a flat measure of the lebag in the complex area c e m 2 measurable set in c for 0 p through lp e we denote the space of the lebeg functions f on e relative to a flat measure m 2 with the usual quasinore f lp e norm at 1 p icle namely f lp e if f m 2 measured and f lp e f z p dm 2 z 1 p mm at 0 p mm f lp e ess sup zlex f z mm with p inous we will further believe that e d z c z 1 let the function f are analytical in d through f k we denote its k na coefficient of macloren if 0 then the next function is also the analytical j f z ger k 0 k 1 f k zk it is called the derivative f in the sense of weil obviously if l is natural then j l f z d d z z l f z if 0 function j f is also called an integral of order let r and 0 p icle 0 q imes following the work 1 and 2 through b q we denote the space of hardy besov namely f b q if with some function 1 z 2 1 q jux f z belongs to lq d quasinorm the norm at 1 q in the space of b q is determined as follows 238 materials of the school conference f b q 1 z 2 1 q jux f z lq d d 1 z 2 1 q jux f z q dm 2 z 1 q mm the determination of the b q space does not depend on with various the corresponding quasinorms are equivalent for the sake of convenience as a rule 1 is believed we say that the function f belongs to the space of bergman 1 ap d 0 p least if it is analytical in d and the finite quasinorm f ap f lp d the norm at 1 p icle through rn f ap inf rn photrn f rn ap n 0 1 2 we denote the best approximation f by means of rational functions of the degree not higher than n next we give some information from the theory of interpolation spaces let the x 0 and x 1 be compatible quasinomated abelevs of groups in order 4 for x x 0 x 1 we introduce k functional ya petra k t inf x 0 x 0 t x 1 x 1 x 0 x 1 x x 0 x 0 x 1 x 1 t 0 where xs s 0 1 is a quasinorm in xs we denote through q 0 1 0 q icle the interpolation function of j peter 4 exactly x x 0 x 1 q x q if x x q 0 t k t q d t t 1 q mm with q x x urb sup t 0 t k t following y peter 4 6 we introduce the approximation space r p q r q ap f ap f r p q mm 0 p q 0 where f r p q ger k 0 1 n n 1 p rn f ap q 1 q q urb 1 sometimes this space is called the space of m m drzhbashyan here we will accept the name of the bergman s space because it is most often found in the literature v r misyuk 239 f r p sup n 1 n 1 p rn rn f ap q theorem 1 3 let 0 0 1 0 1 mm 0 1 1 0 1 and 1 1 0 1 then b 0 0 b 1 1 q b theorem 1 is well known for 1 0 1 q 0 q 1 least see for example 4 chap 6 from the point of view of generalized functions in the material case it was obtained in the books of y peter 7 and h table 6 for analytical functions this theorem was proved by a a pekarsky 3 excellent from the methods used in 4 7 6 theorem 2 4 5 let 0 p q 0 q 1 ughter 0 0 1 mm and 0 1 0 1 and 1 0 1 then r 0 p q 0 r 1 p q 1 q r p q following theorems 1 and 2 and also 8 we come to the following the statement of theorem 3 let 2 p and 1 q 2 p then there is an investmentr q p b q the work was carried out with financial support for the state research program conversation 2020 literature 1 flett t m lipschitz spaces of functions on the circle and the disk j math anal and appl 1972 v 39 no 1 p 121 158 2 pekarsky a a inequalities of the bernstein type for derivatives of rational functions and reverse theorems of rational approximation mat collection 1984 t 124 no 4 c 571 588 3 pekarsky a a rational approaches of convex functions mat notes 1985 t 38 no 5 c 679 690 4 berg j interpolation spaces introduction m mir 1980 264 p 5 peetre j interpolation of normed abelian groups ann mat pura appl 1972 v 92 p 217 262 6 table h theory of functional spaces m mir 1986 447 p 7 peetre j new thoughs on besov spaces math dept duke univ 1976 264 p 8 misyuk v r theorems like jackson and bernstein for
