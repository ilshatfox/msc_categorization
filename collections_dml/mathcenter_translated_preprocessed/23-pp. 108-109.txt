local invariant algebra of functions on the n mortal torah 10 consider c tn banakhov algebra of all continuous functions on the n mortal tora tn closed zagalgebra a algebra c tn on 110 is called uniform if it contains constants and shares the points of the set tn take a uniform algebra on tn invariant relative to shifts and ma is its space of multiplier functionals the transformation of the gelfand of the function f a is called the function f on the multiple ma determined by the ratio f m m f using these designations we introduce f c ma f a they say that f c tn is locally on tn belongs if for any point tn there is such the surroundings u 3 and such a function g a which f coincides with g everywhere on u algebra a is called local on tn if any function belonging locally on tn to a is an element of algebra a algebra a is called local if the local algebra on ma the first example of the non kelkalnaya algebra was proposed by e kollin in 1 theorem 1 for n 2 each uniform algebra on tn invariant relative to shifts is local with n 2 there are non kental invariant algebras on tn 20 in the work 2 the following question was posed by the j raidster if b and a are two uniform algebras on x ma in addition b a and each function from a locally belongs b whether it follows that a b the solution to this issue led to the next result theorem 2 for n 3 on the n mortal tora tn there is such a chain of uniform algebra invested in each other ak ger 1 invariant relative to the shifts that a mak ma 1 for all k 1 2 c dimak ak 1 1 c each function from k locally belongs to algebra k 1 l and t r a t r a 1 kallin e a nonlocal fund algebra proc nat acad sci 1963 v 49 p 821 824 2 raiwater j a remark on regular banach algebras proc amer math soc 1967 v 18 p 255 256 3 gamelin t uniform algebra m mir 1973 111
