some issues of poorly combinatorial and implicit selector sets below are a continuation of the studies published in the work 1 and 2 in 1 the question remained open is it true that the class is weak x y z cks by the sets is strictly contained in the class of weakly xy xz yz cx sets a positive answer to this question is given in 2 it was asked whether it was true that the class is weak x y hens of sets is strictly contained in the class of weakly xyz xyz xy z xyz eis it turns out that the answer to this question is negative let m 1 i m 1 x 1 x 2 xi 1 xi 1 xm 1 and k m the class is weak m heating of the sets it is proved that k m k m 1 as well as that if is a monotonous boulevium a function that depends on no more than four variables then k x y k xy xz yz k u xy xz yz xyz k x and everywhere the inclusions are strict 53 l and t r a t r a 1 degtev a n ivanov d i on poorly combinatorial and selector sets algebra and logic 1998 t 37 no 6 s 627 636 2 degtev a n ivanov d i on the poorly combinatorial and selector sets of dimension 3 discret matte 1999 t 2 no 3 p 126 132 sh t ishmukhametov ulyanovsk ishmukhametov ulsu ru about incomparable elements in the tier degrees of the yershov hierarchy we will study the problem of the existence of incomparable elements in the lower cones of tucal degrees limited by many from the hyrarchy of yershov let a nonal turing degree through d a we denote the lower cone of t spons limited by the degree a i e the totality of t spectacles smaller or equal a consider the attendance of the problem of the existence of incomparable elements in the lower cones limited to recursive permitted degrees theorem 1 in the lower cone d a r for any intermediate degree there is r p degree with a incomparable with b this theorem is proved using the priority method with endless violations let the cone d a are limited by the degree belonging to the second level of the ershov hierarchy i e containing the difference in recursive and redesigned sets in this case the analogue of theorem 1 can no longer be proved using only 0 methods suppose that the opposite case is made that is in the lower cone d a there is a degree with a such that for it in the cone d a there are no incomparable elements then the following property is performed theorem 2 let in the lower cone d a r p there is an intermediate degree b comparable to any degree c a then b recursively listed finally the last theorem claims that if the degree a is 54
