accounts in the actual numbers a i denisov 1 a d shevchenko 2 1 alexey lifeomics gmail com llc intellivizhn kazan volga federal university 2 shevchenka yandex ru oktonus software llc in the classical theory of sets the actual numbers are uncountable the subset of the actual numbers which corresponds to computable functions is counting since in practice there are only those real numbers that can be calculated or at least define we are considering the construction of not the classical theory of sets in which there are no real numbers that cannot be defined many such real numbers will be counting keywords the theory of sets counting real numbers in the classical theory of sets are a strict definition of the actual number see for example 1 such numbers are uncountable on the other hand there is a definition of a valuable number 2 this is the number that corresponds to a function that can be calculated using the turing machine there are only a counting number of such numbers since many programs are counting computational numbers form a subset of all real numbers in practice in most cases scientists and engineers are faced with computable real numbers moreover if you look at the actual number from a geometric point of view it turns out that on a small scale we cannot say that the object is at a certain point of space quantum mechanics impose fundamental restrictions on information about the exact position of objects our knowledge of the position of the object in space what we can measure or read more corresponds to the definition of the calculated number accordingly the question arises of whether there are unsuitable numbers in reality it is impossible to answer this question within the framework of mathematics since comparing mathematical objects is not a real study of mathematics as part of mathematics you can answer other questions such as is it possible to create a mathematical theory within which only computable real numbers will exist what will be the differences in the results between such a theory and the classical the answers to these questions can bring us closer to the understanding of which definition of real numbers more corresponds to reality and moreover potentially this can expand our understanding of the device of the real world 72 lobachev readings 2019 sets and function of belonging we assume that each set should correspond to a function that shows what many belong to it and which are not in this sense we will identify the function and many the simplest functions are an empty variety of void bool voi d set x r etur n f al se and many all many all bool al l set x r etur n tr ue in terms of the function of belonging it is easy to receive an association the intersection and addition of the sets russell s paradox is recorded in the following form many sets of all not belonging to themselves bool r ussel l set x r etur n not x x in the classical theory of sets it is believed that the function of belonging is determined for each argument but in this case if you file the russell function itself it will recursively call itself without stopping it follows that this function of belonging is not determined for this argument that is there are sets for which we cannot always say whether this element enters it or not here is an example of a function that is not defined anywhere bool none set x r etur n none x at first glance with this definition of sets it is possible to avoid classical paradoxes of the naive theory of sets such as russell paradox we especially note that unlike the classical theory in the proposed version many may have elements of which are not determined by this multitude many natural numbers since we have a definition of an empty set 1 as well as in the classical theory of sets we can determine many natural numbers voi d 0 1 0 0 0 0 2 1 1 0 1 n n 1 n 1 0 1 n 1 as well as in the classical theory of many different numbers satisfy the axioms of arithmetic a i denisov a d shevchenko 73 sets a lot of all subsets the final set just as in the classical theory of sets for the final set a b the following subset will exist a b a b as in the classical theory of sets all classical actions can be determined such as intersection associations etc endless sets you can determine the set of all the subservients of domain numbers p n for example containing only even numbers even 2 4 6 it is not difficult to record the function of belonging
