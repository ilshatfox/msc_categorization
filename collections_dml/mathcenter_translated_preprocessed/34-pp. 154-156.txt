regularyized dual algorithm for the task of optimal management with the phase restriction of m i lisachenko nizhny novgorod state university named after n i lobachevsky lismisha yandex ru the report is devoted to dual regulatory 1 for a close solution to the problem of optimal management with the ceiling phase restriction and very convex targeted functionality let u rr convex compact d u lux t 0 t u t u p v on t 0 t the problem i 0 u min i 1 u m c 0 t u d 1 i 0 u t t 0 a 0 t x u u u u u u is considered t x u t b 0 t u t u t dt i 1 u g x u m m m m the set of all incompatible functions in c 0 t x u t t 0 t absolutely a timely solution to the linear system of ordinary differential equations a t x t b t u t c t x 0 x 0 156 corresponding to the control of u d the algorithm of dual regulatory 1 is the direct solution of the problem r v 2 max m l 2 0 t 0 where m are many non negative functions in l 2 0 t v inf uurb u l u i 0 u i 1 u u argmin l u u d it is shown that with the desire to zero the parameter of the regulatory of the regulatory decisions u argmax r m converge as the problem 1 regardless of this exists or exists or exists there is no saddle point of the lagrange functionality the specified convergence is also preserved in the event of an error in the task of the initial data of the task 1 however the indicated error should strive for zero in agreement with the regulatory parameter the issue of iterative regulatory of this dual algorithm and the issue of stopping iteration about the cess in the case of the final fixed error of the task of the outcome data are considered i express my sincere gratitude to the scientific supervisor liu professor m i sumin for setting the task and attention to work the work was carried out with financial support from the rffi about the ect 04 01 00460 157 l and t e r a t r a 1 sumin m i the regulatory dual method of the reverse problem of the final observation for the paraboli equation j calculation mat and matte physical 2004 t 44 no 11 c 2001 2019 symmetry of simmorphic crystallographic groups in the tasks of the theory of branching b v loginov o v makeev ulyanovsk state technical university o makeev ulstu ru loginov ulstu ru in the theory of branching of non linear equations the tasks of impaired symmetry when decisions with the symmetry of crystallographic groups i e are born that when crossing the cavalry parameter the bifur transition that is decisions with a symmetry of the broadcast lattice our works of the last two years have been continuing research on the subgroup structure of solutions of stationary and dynamic bifurcation problems with symmetry of senior critical systems of crystalline systems algonium in this work the results obtained are illustrated by the example of a volume centered vq grate of chemical class d 4 h the volumetric centered grate v q is composed of displacements a 1 tx a 2 ty a 1 a 2 along mutually perpendicular to the second order axes ox and oy and the display a 3 which consists with the basic displacements a 1 and a 2 a 3 12 a 1 a 2 a 1 a 2 determines the displacement tz 2 a 3 a 1 a 2 belonging to the lattice vector 1 2 tz 158
