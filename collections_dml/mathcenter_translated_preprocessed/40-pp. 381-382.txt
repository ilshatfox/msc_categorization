constrained bezier curves 381 in this paper we present two new classes of n th degree bezier curves while its control points n 1 or 1 are always belong to curve degenerate bezier curves may considered as particular case of presented class bezier curve is parametric curve frequently used in computer graphics and related fields to model smooth curves that can scaled indefinitely as usual it is written as follows n t bibf t 1 i o where bf t are bernstein polynomials defined explicitly let us consider that curve 1 has control point n l n t for all t lj then it is possi le to write n n ti l t n i l i i n 1 i o and it follows that n 1 l ntn 1 1 t t bi 7 ti l t n i ntn i o 382 r ziatdinov further we consider that bezier curve has control point 1 bn t for all t 1 then n i i 7 ti l t n i 1 i o n t 0 1 t n 1 t l t n l lbi ti l t n i 1 i 2 and finally we obtain 1 1 ntn l t t 7 t l t n i bo l t the following fi gures show the first class of cu ic constrained bezier curve j f i 1 fig constrained bezier curves at t 0 4 0 8 1 the last figure shows the degenerate bezier curve references 1 farin g curves and surfaces for cagd practical guide academic press 2002 499
