two inequalities between the boundary moments of the inertia of the region the main frequency and area let is a single link area with a limited area on a complex plane consider the boundary moments of the region i dist 2 z da and ic r 2 z da 1 introduced in 1 and named respectively respectively euclidean and conformal moments of the inertia of the region relative to the border here z x iy dist z denotes the function of the distance from point z to the border region r z conformal radius at point z and da an element of the area the starting points of the study are the following two results the first of them is the inequality of the city of polya and g sege 2 p 1 a 4 2 where p is the rigidity of the twisting 1 the main frequency definitions see for example in 2 and a area note that inequality 2 is not optimal further in the viewing article 3 examples of calculating the left part 2 for specific areas are given it is shown in particular that in the type of type 2 the circle is not an extreme area we also note an interesting and important interpretation discussed in 3 and related to the 227 regional task 4 u u 1 0 in u 0 on least 1 note that the use of the equation with the parameter allows you to continuously connect the three most important characteristics of the region from the inequality 2 the second starting point is f g avhadiev 1 problems of saint wenan about the approximation of the stiffness of torsion by a simple geometric characteristic in the class of single link areas theorem a 1 let is a single link area of the complex plane then p i or ic and a chain of inequalities i 6 ic 6 p 6 4 ic 6 64 i using the theorem a you can immediately obtain inequality similar to 2 for i and ic the main result of this work is the proof of inequalities similar 2 for boundary moments with more accurate constants unfortunately these inequalities are also not optimal namely the theorem will be proven let is a single link area with a limited area then inequalities i 1 a ic 1 2 a occur note that these grades are integrated and do not follow from the known preferential assessments indeed the following complicated grades take place equalities are achieved only for the circle and only when the point is taken in the center of the circle dist 2 z 6 r 2 z 6 j 20 1 where j 0 where j 0 2 4048 the first positive root of the function of the zero order the proof of the theorem is based on the method of g polya and g sege stated in the monograph 2 by isoperimetric inequalities as well as on two ratios dist z 1 r z 2 dxdy 2 a 3 the first equality in 3 is a known property of the function of the distance the second equality is proved in 4 228 let ther n 1 is a complete system of own functions in the task of oscillations of the membrane in the we have 4 pipes n 8 n 0 in onic 0 on work accord 0 k 6 l 0 1 6 2 6 3 6 4 where n mmn 1 own values corresponding to the system ther n 1 consider a number of fourier for the dist z function ger n 1 dn accord z 5 we will build in a square and intervene the first equality of 3 and then substitute 5 we get a dist z 2 da dkdl icle z accord z da dkdl work z intern z da using 4 and the formula of green we get icle z vent z da 4 accord wor z n da l lus z da where ds is an element of the length of the border thus we have a l 1 d 2 l l wor z da on the other hand from 1 and 5 we display i dkdl wor z z da 1 d 2 l da of the last two equations taking into account 4 and the fact that the final number cannot be for any area of its own values the first basic result 1 i l 1 1 d 2 l can easily follow wor 2 l z da l 1 d 2 l wor z da a the second basic inequality is proved similarly while the second ratio of 3 is used the work was carried out with financial support from the rffif project 02 01 00168 229 list of literature 1 avhadiev f g solving the generalized problem of saint venan matem sat 1998 t 189 n 12 c 3 12 2 polya g segeo g isperimetric inequalities of mathematical physics m fizatgiz 1962 336 p 3 hersch j isoperimetric monotonity some properties and conjecturs connection between isoperimemetric inequalitis siim rev 30 no 4 p 551 577 4 avhadiev f g variation conform and invariant inequalities and their applications dokl an russia 1998 t 359 n 6 s 727 730 r b salimov p l shabalin kazan to solve the edge problem of hilbert with an endless index and a counting set of points of rupture of the coefficients 1 the task of hilbert for half frost with infinite and
