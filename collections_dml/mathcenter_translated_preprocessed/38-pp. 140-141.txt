one task of the theory of elasticity for the composite wedge flat shared elastic wedge consisting of two homogeneous izotropic wedge shaped regions about e a and 3 in o o r oo with elastic modules in the es of 1 e 2 and coeffit by the poisson v l and v 2 respectively is in equilibrium the top of the composite wedge is fixed rotation at the point with the coordinates b o r ro r 0 o is absent on the beam b o set the conditions of smooth contact the first main task of the theory of elasticity is considered the boundary conditions are specified in the form of sedate rows with the blessed radii of convergence the solution of the problem is searched in the form of steppe rows 00 00 l r c l l e rn a j r b l in b rn rn n o n o 00 00 t r c l with b rn u l r c l d j rp n o n o 00 v l r c l fjj o rn j 1 2 1 n o where l e in c c v e d b f l o unknown functions here and below the upper index j corresponds to the fins with parameters e j l j facial 1 in differentiation equations of equilibrium 1 p 122 and the equation of inequality find a b b o c l b further using e g ivanov 141 law hook and the connection of deformation with the components of the displacement 2 p 92 93 we determine d 8 f j 8 for example a l r 8 a sin 28 b cos 28 s 8 d l a sin n 2 8 b cos n 2 8 nfo with l p 2 sin nb d j n 2 cos nb rp n n 2 n n 2 for unknown 1 0 ephones a b jf d 1 the condition of smooth contact of the wedge shaped regions and the boundary us yuvia are used further the task comes down to solving a system consisting of eight linear equi and eight unknown a study of the system is carried out it is shown that the resulting steppe rows have a bored radius of convergence at the last stage specific examples are considered when the given functions are polynomas or whole functions e r sin r cos r etc literature 1 ufland i s integral ny transformations in the task ah theory of elasticity l science 1968 402 p 2 tymoshenko s p boeper j theor i ya elasticity m science 1975 576 p
