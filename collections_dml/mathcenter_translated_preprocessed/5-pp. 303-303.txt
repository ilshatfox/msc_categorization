special linear and projective analytical devices of the projective space will assign the projective space pn to the mobile repera ag i j k o n derivational formulas have the form da 1 w 1 a where d is the sign of ordinary differentiation we will produce these formulas external using the completeness of the differentials of the enzymes da 1 d dag o where d symbol of the external differentials of losing we receive structural equations doo oo l line group gl n 1 which acts ineffective in the space p n from the group gl n 1 an effective specialized linear group sgl n l using the equality of oo o it is called a condition for the equi projectivity in essence the condition of the project this special linear apparatus is not always convenient a about the effect space pn is a generalization afford spaces an but structural equations of the astfine ga n which are in the space of the antra n do not follow the equations of the sgl n i 1 group b when limiting the special linear appal of the pn space for subspace pm whether the neutral apparatus is obtained in other words when the sgl group n 1 operates in the space of p 11 the gl m t 1 group acts in the subspace p m the projective analytical apparatus deprived of the indicated deficiency of 1 1 o kv is built using basic forms 8 j co o a projective group gp n the isomorphic group sgl n 1 highlighting the value about the index g o i l j k l n and lowering it in forms 8 8 from the structural equations of the group gl n 1 we will find the equations of the gp group n 00 1 ej e de e e ek 8 1 eko oko d 81 e e j this device is suitable for describing strata above the space of p for example the theorem is fair projective pneummark pn considered as 1 the space of points is a codonal 2 the space of hyperpravka is a smooth smooth more precisely affinant 303
