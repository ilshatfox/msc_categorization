some properties of means of bloch functions 1 introduction and results let be the unit disc z 1 for an analytic function f in we set f b sup z 1 z 2 f z the bloch class b is the set of all analytic functions f on for which f b the quantity f 0 f b defines the norm of the linear space b which equipped with this norm is a banach space see e g 1 12 351 the space b 0 consists of all f b such that 1 z 2 f z 0 as z 0 and b 1 consists of all f b such that if zn and f zn then 1 zn 2 f zn 0 note that b 0 b 1 b let s be the standard class of analytic univalent functions f in normalized by f 0 f 0 1 0 for a let the mo bius mapping a be given by the formula z a z e i a z 1 a z where r in 11 the notion of linearly invariant family was given as a class m of functions h z z analytic and locally univalent in and satisfying the following condition for every mo bius mapping and every h m the function f z h z h 0 h 0 0 z belongs to m the number ord h sup f 0 2 is a mo bius mapping we call the order of the function h there are many interesting examples of linearly invariant families see 11 the universal linearly invariant or mo bius invariant family u is the class of all functions h z z analytic and locally univalent on such that ordh 6 ch pommerenke 11 showed that u for 1 u 1 is the well known class of convex functions and s u 2 in 15 the second author introduced the following linearly invariant family of functions u u definition 1 the family u consists of all functions f such that f z exp 2 2 0 log 1 zeit d t 1 1 where t is a complex valued function with bounded variation on 0 2 such that 2 0 d t 1 2 0 d t 6 1 1 2 for many extremal problems in u extremal functions belong to u in 16 it was given the following 352 definition 2 the family u consists of all functions f such that there exist a convex univalent function s z z note that s u 1 u 1 and a schwartz function analytic in 0 0 such that f z s z exp 2 2 0 log 1 z eit d t 1 3 where t is a complex valued function with bounded variation on 0 2 such that 2 0 d t 6 1 2 0 d t 0 1 4 u is a linearly invariant family of order u u the families u and u are not contained in each other for 1 in 3 see also 9 it was shown that g b if and only if there exists a function f u such that g z g 0 log f z 1 5 a function g belongs to the space bmoa if g h 1 and the boundary values of g on the unit circle t belong to bmo t or equivalently if the function g a z g a 0 belongs to h 1 for every a the main properties of the space bmoa one can find in 2 6 since bmoa h it seems to be interesting to find the set of all functions f u for which log f bmoa in the paper we give a partial answer to this problem in the next theorem we give a relationship between the families u u and bmoa theorem 1 i f u log f bmoa ii f u log f bmoa now we will prepare a ground for integral means in the bloch space for 0 p and analytic in function g we define ip r g 1 2 g rei p d 0 r 1 clunie and macgregor 4 and makarov 10 proved the sharp estimate ip r f o log 1 1 r p 2 r 1 353 for p 0 and f b what is known about the integral means of the derivatives of bloch functions girela 8 proved that if f b 1 then lim inf r 1 1 r 2 i 2 r f 0 moreover there exists a function f b such that lim r 1 1 r 2 i 2 r f 0 in this paper we characterize the integral means of functions from b 0 theorem 2 for a given function x positive and sufficiently slowly decreasing with lim x x 0 there exists a function f b 0 such that lim inf r 1 1 r 2 i 2 r f log 1 r let us note that if f b 0 and r 1 then the expression 1 r 2 i 2 r f can tend to 0 sufficiently slowly 2 proofs of results proof of theorem 1 let f be a function from a linearly invariant family m then fa z f z a 1 a z f a f a 1 a 2 m for every a we have log f a z log f z a 1 a z log f a 2 log 1 a z note that log 1 z bmoa 1 z is univalent and 1 z 6 0 see for example 2 since the function 1 a z is subordinated to 1 z for every a by littlewood theorem see 5 log 1 a z h 1 6 log 1 z h 1 a thus we have the following inequality 2 0 log f re i a 1 a rei log f a d 6 2 0 log f a rei d 2 2 0 log 1 rei d 354
