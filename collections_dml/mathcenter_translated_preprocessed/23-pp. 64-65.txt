supporting matrix groups let k means a switching associative ring with a unit as usual gln k is a group of all reversible sln k special utn k unchargled matrices of degree n over k for certainty we believe that utn k is a group of upper unchargled matrices in 1 the theorem 1 group g uln k gln k sln k degree n 3 above the switching associative ring k with a unit is constructivized then and only when the ring k is constructivized c s goncharov during the report at the algebra and logic seminar asked if the analogue of the theorem 1 is fair for very constructive matrix groups the next theorem answers this question theorem 2 group g uln k gln k sln k degree n 66 3 above the switching associative ring k with the unit is very constructivized and only when the ring k is very constructivized l and tr t r a 1 romankov v a khismiev n g on constructive matrix loads algebra and logic in the press i i sakhaev kazan ishak sahajev ksu ru one sided nil ideal does not always give rise to the accelerative rings of the ring we will denote through the mn r the ring of all square matrices of the nth order above the ring r j r the radical of jacobson ring r amitsur in 1 and the cream in 2 formulated the following equivalent hypotheses hypothesis 1 the new sided nil ideal of the ring will be invested in nil ideal the problem of keta 3 hypothesis 2 if r is a nil ring then mn r is nil ring for each n hypothesis 3 if r is a nil ring then the ring of all polynomials r x is quasiregular smoktunovich 4 gave a partial negative response to the hypothesis 3 if r is the nil ring then the ring of all polynomials r x is nikolts theorem there is algebra r above the simple field k characteristics 2 with such the right nil ideal j that the ideal m 2 a of the m 2 r rings is not nil ideal where a is the ideal of algebra r generated by the right willy ideal j l and t r a t r a 1 amitsur s a nil radicals historical notes and some new results colloquia math soc janos bolyai 6 rings modules and radicals keszthely hungary 1971 p 47 65 67
