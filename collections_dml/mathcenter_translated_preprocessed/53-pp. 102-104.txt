the chaotic dynamics in systems set by one dimensional display many processes of the real world both stable and nonlinear can be described in the form of mathematical moles of some dynamic systems in modern designs the problems of the deterministic chaos which are generated by the internal essence of nonlinear processes are increasingly being considered the study of their dynamics as well as the search for the conditions for the occurrence of chaos in systems of various kinds is very acting at present the chaotic behavior of systems is being studied in the studies of the earth s atmosphere various phrasic processes in biology ecology in information technology the laws of dynamic chaos are applied for pussy search and protection of information the work is devoted to the location and evidence of the conditions for the existence of chaos in the study of simple models of di native systems set by one dimensional display with one and two parameters a complete study of the dynamics of display f x m x 3 6 x specified in the actual area was carried out the intervals of the values of the parameter m are determined and the existing of the random behavior of the orbit of points for all found intervals is proved the proof of the existence of the chaos of the opi n i nashrov i a khvyuzov 103 is on the glending theorem 1 it should be noted that serious attention is paid to the study of the dynamics of symmetric and asymmetric tent shaped display and these models are studied quite well see e g 2 4 discrete dynamic systems set by tent like display are increasingly used in the construction of environmental and population models 5 to solve the problems of thermal power industry 6 and in other branches of science and human activity at the same time the studies of asymmetry tent shaped display known to us in which various methods of studying dynamics and methods proof of the existence of chaos were not exhaustive we studied the dynamics of the display set by the system of two linear functions with parameters f x 1 ax x 6 0 1 bx x 0 in the process of research the plane of parameters a b times the bit in the area where the display has the same dynamics founded and two peridic points f x the deferes are found their types are built web and bifurcation diagrams were built for each area analytical methods about the knowledge of the dynamics of display f x for the possesses of the values of the parameters in which the existence of chaos is observed the proof of the chaotic behavior of the orbit of the points was carried out using the glending theorem 1 l and t r a t r a 1 glendining p stability instabide and chaos cambridge cambridge univ press 1994 399 p 104 l yu nizamiev 2 al shameriw f h mahiubm a some dynamical properties of the family of tent maps int j of math analysis 2013 v 7 no 29 p 1433 1449 3 lindstrom t thunberg h an elementary approach to dynamics and bifurcations of skew tent maps j dif eq and appl 2008 v 14 p 819 833 4 sushko i gardini l degenerate bifurcations and border collisions in piecewise smooth 1 d and 2 d maps int j of bifurcation and chaos 2010 v 20 no 7 p 2045 2070 5 lindstromt dynamical properties of maps fitted to data in the noise free limit j of biological dynamics 2013 v 7 no 1 p 108 116 6 wang shuang xin li han zhang xiu xia wang zhi qin nonlinear predictive control of boiler turbine generation unit bass optimization 2 nd chaotic modeling and simulation intern conf crete greece 2009 l yu nizamiev kazan national research technical university named after a n tupoleva kai nizamievalu ya ru professional oriented orientation of mathematical education at a technical university at a technical university in the process of forming a specialist a special role belongs to the course mathematics professional education of the future graduate of a technical university implies very serious mathematical training
