the method of processing mathematical documents in the omdoc format is currently the development of the internet in many ways related to semantic processing of information see e g 1 os is a new problem when processing text files incomplete structuring and differences in the grammatical buildings of different languages the document created in the tex note also p o gafurova 71 does not have semantic expressiveness which does not allow to perform complete computer processing of the document this means that you need a new machine oriented format of the document see e g 2 the difficulty of processing mathematical documents is related to the dual structure of the mathematical text and its non linearity the documents consist of a set of formulas determination of divisions lemma theorem evidence and as a rule do not have a tree like structure which would naturally be presented in the xml format 3 one of the approaches to solving these problems is proposed in the works 3 5 the omdoc format has been developed which uses the presentation mathml notation for representing formulas see e g 2 and rdf to denote links at the moment omdoc uses the option of the contents of the rhetorical structure theory rst which supports such types of relations as annotation introduction conclusion thesis antithesis and a number of others the use of this format allows you to solve a number of problems associated with the processing of tex files although problems such as subperational plura lism and inflexformality remain unresolved 4 in this work a software tool is proposed that allows the processing of omdoc files the application is written in the programming language c as the input parameter the name omdoc file is used the result of the application of the application is a list of terms with katya horization and indicating the connections it should be noted that when translating mathematical documents to the omdoc format one can set ties not only among documents in russian but also to provide connections with documents in other languages tu 72 p o gafurov the opportunity allows you to combine mathematical documents in different languages using ties and form complete information about this object which in the future is used to be used in the construction of the world digital mathematical library see e g 6 7 the work was carried out with the financial support of the russian federation and the government of the republic of tatarstan projects 15 07 08522 15 47 02472 l and t r a t r a 1 elizarova m lipachev k malakhaltsev a language of the marking of a semantic web practical as pects kazan publishing house kazan university 2008 url http window edu ru catalog pdf 2 txt 971 73971 53132 2 elizarova m lipachev k malakhaltsevom a based on you mathml presentation of mathematical texts on internet m fizatlit 2010 198 p 3 kohlhase omdoc an open markup format for mathematical documents fb informatik universitat des saarlandes d 66041 saarbrucken germany 2000 64 p 4 kohlhasem omdoc an open markup format for mathematical documents version 1 2 springer 2006 428 p 5 kohlhasem iancum co cressenting structer and meaning of mathematical documents computer science jacobs university bremen germany october 26 2015 24 p 6 developing a 21 st century global library for mathematics research washington d c the national academies press 2014 131 p url http www nap edu catalog 18619 develo ping a credury global libaray for mathematics research 7 elizarova m zhiltsov g kirillovich lipa cheve k nevzorova a ontomath ecosystem and o v hermider v n popov 73 of the world digital mathematical library proceedings of the mourning conf by computer and claw linguistics tel 2016 ka dawn publishing house kazan university 2016 s 25 28 o v hermider v n popov north arctic federal university named after m v lomonosova o germider narfu ru v popov narfu ru mathematical modeling of transfer processes in the channel formed by two cylinders as part of the free molecular regime solved the problem of thermal massacre formed by two cylinders radius r 1 and r 2 which form the paralle of the lelna and the axes are shifted relative to each other by the distance a the channel maintain constant gradients of tours and pressure temperatures as the main equation describing the process of the process the equation of williams was used recorded in the cylindrical coordinate system 1 and in the form of the boundary condition on the wall of the canal a diffusion model the deviation of the gas state from the equilibrium is supposed to be small which allows you to get a solution to the problem in a linarized form to find a linear amendment to the local moral distribution function the task is reduced to the solution of a linear uniform differential equalization in private derivatives of the first order c cos z ro c z z z sin z z 1 0 1
