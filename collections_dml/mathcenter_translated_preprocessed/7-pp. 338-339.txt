construction of the circuit according to the distributions of mass concentration and stream of substance a yu khasanov the kazan financial and economic institute econot kfei in the late 70 s of our centuries kcn riy the reverse edge task was set for the equation of stationary heat transfer according to the boundary conditions of the i and 11 clans the solution to this problem in the assumption of the symmetry of the desired semi norfront circuit was implemented in the work 1 the method of constructing an unknown circuit set forth in it is taking lem to solve the reverse edge problem for the equation of stationary mass exchange the possibility of this application is due to the fact that in the condition of the inpatient thermal power supply the equation of the transfer of mass concentration of the substance is similar to the equation of heat transfer with a turn of the surfaces by applying or removing the substance it can be accepted that the flow of the substance is proportional to the concentration gradient staging determine the symmetrical semi pointed end of the tour streamlined by the potential stream of electrolyte which has the properties of an ideal inconspicuous fluid according to the equalized distribution of mass concentration and the removal of a substance with 338 of the upper of this contour determined by the values of the gradient of the concentration of the tension the solution to this problem is carried out by the method set forth in 1 and can be applied when designing the cathode tool for the gas on the surface of the metal layer substrate literature 1 khasanova a yu the reverse regional task of the theory of heat transfer the seminar ponds for regional tasks kazan publishing house kazan university 1983 svyp 20 s 212 219 339
