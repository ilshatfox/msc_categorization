one assessment of the final difference of the nth order is introduced let f z a function analytical in half plate re z 0 denote through 1 f z z z 1 the final difference of the first order i e 1 f z z z 1 f z z 1 f z z z 1 we determine the final difference of the nth order by the recurrent formula n f z z z 1 zn 1 n 1 f z z z 1 zn 1 z zn with fixed z 1 zn the final difference of the nth order is an analytical function from z in 1 an upper assessment of the divided difference of the first order f z was obtained z 0 z 1 f z 0 f z 1 z 0 z 1 analytical in a single circle e z 1 the functions based on the assessment of its derivative f z further in 2 of this kind of assessments they were obtained for the divided difference of the n th order of order determined by the recurrent formula f z z 0 z 1 zn f z z 0 zn 1 f z z 1 zn z 0 zn as an appendix of the received assessments for example is given the following result let the first divided difference of the function f z z a 2 z 2 a 3 z 3 does not turn to zero in e then this function is single in e and for any of its n th divided difference the valuation is fair f f f z z 0 zn 6 1 n m 0 1 1 zm n m 0 1 1 zm n 0 1 2 the equal sign takes place and only when all points are z 0 zn are located on a radius of a single circle inclined at an angle to the material axis and the function f z has the form f z z 1 e i z 2 note 3 that the condition for the unreason in the zero of the n th final difference of the function f z into entails 158 single leafness of the function f n 1 z in since the value of single leafful functions in the theory of conformal display is not in doubt the question of assessing the final difference of the n th order of order seems relevant in this work the upper assessment of the module of the above finite difference of the nth order is given the following theorem will call the transition theorem the meaning of which is the transition from the assessment of the n th derivative to the assessment of the nth finite difference 1 for the formulation and evidence of the transition theorem we agree in the designations t t 1 tn point n mortal region v determined by inequalities 0 6 t 1 6 1 0 6 tn 6 1 t z 0 z 1 t 1 zntn t r 0 r 1 t 1 rntn where z 0 z 1 zn and zm rm m 0 1 n l a ray emanating from the beginning of the coordinates at an angle to the material axis note that t t v theorem let the inequality of f n z 6 m n z z 1 where m x continuous in the interval 0 urb a function that has a strictly increasing n th derivative m n x in this interval then the following statements are fair 1 there is inequality n f z z 0 zn 6 n m r r 0 r 1 rn z 0 zn 2 where zm rm m 0 1 n 2 in order for some z 0 z 1 zn and f n z 6 constertic occurred n f z z 0 zn n m r r 0 r 1 rn 3 it is necessary and enough that such material and exist for which the conditions are met a all points z 0 z 1 zn lie on a certain ray l i e zm rme i m 0 1 n and t t ei t v b all values of the function f n t lie on a certain ray l and f n t ei m n t ei t v 159 we will need some lemmas lemma 1 for the final difference of the nth order the representation of n f z z 0 zn z 1 zn 1 0 1 0 f n z 0 z 1 t 1 zntn dt 1 dtn 4 in fact z 1 1 0 f z 0 z 1 t 1 dt 1 1 0 f z 0 z 1 t 1 d z 0 z 1 t 1 f z 0 z 1 f z 0 f z z 0 z 1 and the formula 4 is fair at n 1 using the method of mathematical induction it is easy to verify the justice of the formula 4 with any natural n note that from lemma 1 follows that n m r r 0 r 1 rn 0 let us write 4 in the form of n f z z 0 zn z 1 zn v f n t dv 5 lemma 2 let g t continuous in v function in order to make equality v g t dv v g t dv 6 is necessary and enough for all g t values to lie on a certain ray l i e g t g t ei t v proof necessity let it be for continuous in v of the integral function g t equality 6 put v g t dv v g t dv ei 160 then equality 6 can be recorded in the form of v re e i g t dv v ei g t dv 7 in addition re e i g t 6 ei g t t v 8 functions re e i g t and ei g t continuous in v therefore from 7 and 8 it follows the re e i g t ei g t anywhere t v but then all the values of the function g t at points t v are on the beam l sufficiency let all values of the integrated continuous f
