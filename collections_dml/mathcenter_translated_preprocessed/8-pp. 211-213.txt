the permissibility of the integral equation of the voltairer in the space of asymptotically periodic as the functions of functions the permissibility of the pair of spaces asymptotically periodic as the functions for the equation x t t 0 k t s x s ds f t 1 where the core is k t s is determined everywhere in the area ura s t mm and satisfies the conditions 1 1 k t s k t s urb s t mm 211 2 with any t 0 matrix k t s is summarized by s for 0 t and lim h 0 t 0 t h s k t s ds t h t t h s ds 0 determination 1 continuous and limited to 0 function x t has a zero limit as the lean is with t if for any number 0 the condition t t x t rn 0 for t urb is performed we use for this limit the designation lim t x t 0 and for the space of such functions c 0 determination 2 continuous on 0 function x t is called asymptotically periodic as it is if x t z t y t where z t z t y t c 0 the space of all such functions is denoted by p the following statements are proven theorem 1 let the resolver r t s equations 1 satisfies the conditions 1 sup tham 0 r t s ds imes 2 the function ivil t 0 urb r t s exp i 2 k s ds k 0 1 i 1 continuous on 0 and lim t onic t 0 3 lim t 0 r t s s 0 212 4 for any closed set f 0 of the final measure and any 0 there is such a t 0 that depends on f and that t t 0 f t 0 t r t t t t t s ds mm then the couple p p is permissible for the equation 1 comment conditions 1 3 of theorems are also necessary for the permissibility of the pair p p regarding equalization 1 theorem 2 let the pair p p is permissible for the opera of the torus k x t t 0 k t s x s ds and t 0 0 sup tural t 0 t 0 k t s ds 1 then pair p p is also permissible for the equation 1 l and t r a t r a 1 pulyaev v f tsalyuk z b dif equations 1974 t x no 6 s 1103 1110 f f sultanbekov kazan about grichi homogeneous logic with the only state be m are natural numbers quantum logic partially ordered set omp l is called n m a home 1 if each atom is contained in 213
