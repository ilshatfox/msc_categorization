the classification of polynomas with the smallest integral norm according to their four senior coefficients let the material rn 4 x xn 4 a 1 xn 3 a 2 x n 2 a 3 xn 1 a 4 xn an 4 has the smallest norm in 70 space l 1 1 due to the choice of a 4 an 4 depending on the point t a 1 a 2 a 3 polin rn 4 x can have n i the change of the sign on i 1 1 where i 1 4 let di n n 4 di many of all those points t in which rn 4 x has an even n i sign of sign to i forms of polynomas rn i x for points t di are contained in paragraph i theorems 7 1 i 1 4 we will describe everything di here let the area h consists of points u v r 2 in conditions 2 u 3 v u 1 2 4 4 with 1 u 3 and also 2 u 3 v 2 u 3 for u 3 theorem 1 point a 1 a 2 a 3 d 1 n 4 if only if one of two points p q r u v w we have w 2 27 u 2 3 v u u 2 3 v uv 9 u v h or w v 1 u when u v h we put further p a 1 2 3 q 2 a 2 n 2 2 r 2 a 3 n 1 2 a 1 as well as p q r r 2 2 p 2 p 2 3 q r q 2 4 q 3 p 2 let r r p q p 2 p 2 3 q 2 p 2 q 3 2 p 2 q q q q q 0 then equation x 3 3 px 2 3 qx r 0 has the roots x 1 x 2 x 0 condition a means only x 0 1 1 similarly conditions b v are introduced at roots x 1 x 2 requirements a b v are set by simple inequalities on p q r which are not given here theorem 2 point a 1 a 2 a 3 d 2 n 4 only in cases 1 2 1 with p q r 0 and condition v inequality 3 2 8 p is performed 6 q 3 4 2 p for p 2 p 2 q cos ory 4 3 onic arcos s p 2 q 3 2 s r 3 pq 2 p 3 2 2 the inequality p 2 3 p 2 q 1 2 5 or inequality 3 2 8 p 6 q 3 4 2 p 8 6 71 in this case in 1 2 the value is selected depending on the sign more precisely a with 0 and 1 3 p 3 q r 1 3 p 3 q b 1 2 is taken p s 2 1 3 s 2 1 3 b for 0 if r r p q and conditions are respected 3 p 1 p 1 4 q p 2 1 p 1 3 p 1 p 1 4 p 1 then in 1 2 is taken p 2 p 2 q and if r r p q then p 2 p 2 q if 3 p 1 p 1 4 q p 2 1 p 1 3 p 1 p 1 4 1 p c for 0 in 1 2 is taken p 2 p 2 q cos ory 2 k 3 onic arcos s p 2 q 3 2 where k 0 k 1 when performing conditions a b respectively theorem 3 point a 1 a 2 a 3 d 4 n 4 n 1 if only if 1 1 2 3 0 1 1 2 3 0 3 ophas 1 2 3 3 0 1 2 1 3 3 0 where i are taken from paragraph 4 theorem 7 1 after this the point from d 3 n 4 are set by the difference d 3 n 4 r 3 d 1 d 2 d 4 thus the task of zolotarev 1 see 1 was solved at l 4 the case l 1 examined korkin and zolotarev 1873 and l 2 and l 3 y heronimus 1935 and f pierstorfer 2 the work was supported by the russian federation project 01 01 00346 l and t r a t r a 1 gate v e about the polynomas the least evading zero in the metric l 1 1 dokl ras 2000 t 370 no 5 c 583 586 2 peherstorfer f lineare und nichtlinere l 1 approximation dissertation wyen 1978 72
