universal morphism of vector stratification of r n alishev kazan state university let vectn have many vector stratification of rank n over compact varieties vector stratification hole is called universal if for any stratification vectn there is a smooth display f of its base b into the bu universal stratification base called the classification such that f ising it is known that universal vector stratification exists and the ring of the claw h bu of the universal stratification base contains all the characteristic classes of vector stratification from vectn in the sense that any characteristic class of stratification vectn is f h bu where f is f classifying display 3 4 the purpose of this work is to build universal morphism of vector stratification the need for such a construction arises when studying the characteristics of morphisms of vector stratification see 1 2 definition a pair of vector stratification e e 0 of the rank m k above the variety m will call such a couple of stratification e e 0 that e 0 is an extension e ranke 0 k m ranke 13 let s say that the variety m has a type p if it allows the coating no more than p are in areas homotopically equivalent points we fix the p and designate through vectm k many pairs of vector stratification of the rank m k above the varieties of the type p put gn m k v 0 v v 0 v rn dim v 0 n m dim v n k offer there is a universal pair of vector stratification u hole 0 with the base gn m k where n depends on p such that for any pair ctor vectm k there is a smooth display f of its base b in gn m k with the property f 0 f 0 any morphism e f of the vector stratification of the rank n above the variety m is unambiguously set by its graph graph which is a vector decrease in the stratification of e f a transversal second direct terms theorem for any natural n there are n n p and a pair of vector stratification u hole 0 with the base gn n n such that for any morphism e f of vector wagons n above diversity m type p there is a smooth display f m gn 2 n n such that f e f and f 0 graph thus a couple of vector stratification lection hole 0 is natural to consider as universal morphism of vector stratification of the same rank over the variety of the final type l and t r a t r a 1 harvey p r lawson h b a theory of characteristic classes associated with singular connection asterisque 1993 v 213 p 1 268 fourteen
