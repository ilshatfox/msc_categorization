areas that satisfy the condition of a homogeneous cone on the groups of the carno m mauccous group carno 1 is a coherent single cylnese nilpotent group of lee g algebrah which decomposes into a direct sum of vector spaces v 1 vm such that v 1 vk vk 1 for 1 k m 1 and v 1 vm 83 0 let d x y metric carno karateodory of the group g deltas x sixik a group of sprains g see 1 2 we denote through b y r the ball in the carno karateodori metric on g let d g some limited area and z d we say that d satisfies the condition of the internal homogeneous cone at point z if there is a ball b y z r z in the carno karateodori metric on g such that z z s x s 0 s 0 z x b y z r z d region d satisfies the condition of the internal homogeneous cone if it satisfies this condition at its each boundary point z and in this case there is a constant k 0 such that min r z d z y z k for each point z d also region d satisfies the condition of an external homogeneous cone if the g d area satisfies the condition of the internal homogeneous cone for areas of carno groups the concept of a homogeneous cone was introduced by l kaponya and n harophalo 3 in the study of the properties of solutions of subroilliptical equations in addition the region with the condition of a homogeneous cone play an important role in the theory of investments of functional spaces in carno groups 4 the areas that satisfy the condition of a homogeneous cone are closely related to the regions of john john region on carno groups are determined relative to the carno karathori metrics in the traditional way see for example 5 we have installed a theorem on carno groups there are limited areas of john that do not meet the conditions of the internal and external homogeneous cones the work was supported by the rffif and the program universities of russia l and t r a 1 pansu p m triques de carnot carath odory et quasiisom tries desespace sym triques de rang un ann of math 1989 v 119 p 1 60 84 2 vodop yanov s k p differentiability on carnot groups in different topologies and related topics tr by analysis and geometry editor compiler s k vodopyanov novosibirsk publishing house of institute matem them s l sobolev sb ras 2000 s 603 670 3 capogna l garofalo n boundary behavior of non negative solutions of subellipts in nta domains for carnot caratheodory metrics fourier anal appl 1998 v 4 no 4 p 403 432 4 romanovsky n n integral performances and investments for the functions set in the groups of heisenberg hn in print 5 capogna l tang p uniform domains and quasiconformal mappings on heisenberg group manuscripta math 1995 v 86 no 3 p 267 281 s a grigoryan r n gumerov a v kazantsev kazan the surfaces of bora riman over the big disk study algebraic covers of the big disk local compact factorization g 0 1 g 0 cylinder g 0 1 where g is a compact abel group that arises as a group of characters of the subgroup rdiscr the latter as you know is isomorphically parametrilized by the group of characters group g a aives each character is a a 0 you can continuously continue on assuming a r a ra g r 0 1 the extreme case of this scheme when rdiscr is the compacting of the boron gave the name to the indicated coverage closely related to the riman surfaces due to the presence of a dense complex structure in everywhere which is generated by immersion into g of the r eucl group which turns g into the solenoid it is significant that the opposite case of the borovsky case z leads to c that is to the riman surfaces itself the construction of analytical and algebraic structures on the bigdisa is based on the existence of the algebra of freche o the elements of which are generalized analytical functions 85
