generalizations of the inequality of koshi bunakovsky in spaces with indefinite metric in the work 1 2 generalizations of the inequalities of koshi bunya kovsky in integral and discrete forms were obtained for example the clarification of discrete inequality has the form 1 where the middle part a x y is determined by the arbitrariness similar generalizations were obtained for the inequality of koshi bunakovsky in the spaces of minkovsky lorenu with a familiar norm theorem let p p x 5 z o u 5 l yt 0 k i k l then is fair with the middle part a x y from 1 houo t x yk houo j a x y 202 the results obtained can be applied to grades of sampling of some integral operators in the theory of relativity and geometric tasks literature 1 sitnik s m conditions of the integral inequality of koshi bunakovsky vestnik samar state tech un te 2000 no 9 p 37 45 2 sitnik s m some supplies of clarification of the unequal of koshi bunakovsky bulletin of samar state economy acad 2002 no 1 8 with 302 313 o m solycheva nizhny novgorod solycheva list ru multiple lipshitsev operators super position in wotterman lvv spaces in the work are represented by the necessary and sufficient conditions for the generators of multi digit superposition operators who satisfy the caliber and operating in the wah waterman the results of the work summarize for a multi valued case some of the results of the work 1 3 let x 11 11 y 11 11 banakh space i a b with jr k c convex cone k 1 many functions from i to k ss y many non empty convex compact submarines in with the hausdorf metric d and l ln l with jr non reatheating iedovatianness pressing it numbers from the property e l 1 up 00 for f i ss y recording f e lbv i ss y means that the value of vl f sup in e 1 d f bp f ap lp is finite where the supremum is taken by all t i and all disordered on the bore v 1 ip non legal segments in ap b with i see see see 4 with ss y jr many lbv i ce y is metric 203
