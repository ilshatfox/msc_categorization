the recommended automatic selection system udc g s yamalytdinova we consider the most popular classifiers for systematization of scientific information there are proposed the using recommender system for automation of the classification process and tanimoto s measure for proximity evaluation we give an algorithm of forming classificator s dictionary there is a version of the automatic selection for the udc service keywords recommendatory system classifier udc systematization of scientific information udc 517 98 on some operator inequalities a a sami 1 1 samialbarkish gmail com kazan federal university we prove some operator inequalities for a hilbert space keywords hilbert space linear operator projection operator inequality hyponormal operator let b h be a algebra of all bounded linear operators on a hilbert space h i be the identity operator an operator a b h is hyponormal if a a aa 1 let b h pr p b h p p 2 p theorem 1 let x y b h and z x y then x x z y y y z x 34 z z we have also x x z y 3 4 l y y corollary 1 let x y b h and z x y i we have x x z y 3 4 l y y 1 z z for all 0 1 ii if y or z is left invertible then x x z y is invertible 168 iii we have y y i or z z i for some number 0 thus x x z y 3 4 l i theorem 2 let x y b h and z x y then for all numbers a b 0 we have 1 a x x 1 1 al y y z z 1 b x x 1 1 l bl y y via theorem 1 and 2 we have corollary 2 let x y b h and z x y then for all a 0 we have x x z y y y z x 3 4 l 1 a x x 1 1 al y y theorem 3 suppose p q b h pr and a p p with c r then the following conditions are equivalent i an operator a a aa is invertible ii the operators p q p q are invertible under this conditions operator a is invertible theorem 4 suppose b b h sa q b h pr a b q with c r then the following conditions are equivalent i an operator a is hyponormal ii bq qb under this conditions an operator a is normal references 1 halmos p r a hilbert space problem book d van nostrand company inc london 1967
