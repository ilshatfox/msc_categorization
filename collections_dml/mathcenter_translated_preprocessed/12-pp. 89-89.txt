application of adaptive integration in the method of boundary temporal elements l a igumnov v m sennikov nnsu the city of nizhny novgorod discusses the decision of non stationary dynamic margins for the dachas of the three dimensional isotropic theory of elasticity using a direct approach in the method of boundary temporal elements mgve extra minute bikwadratic elements are used to describe the geomete of the body bilinear elements for boundary movements according to the standing elements by surface forces and linear elements for ok 1 in the work the calculations of the yurregrals are pre flooded using the adaptive number of leyu integration which realizes the automatic selection of the quadrature formula and the division of the element into subwalries into its distance to a special point the described mgve scheme is used for the calculations of the problem 1 on the action of non stationary pressure on the border of the elastic ball and the spherical cavity in the boundless elastic environment having an analytical rope and the sprais of the square slab with a cylindrical hole with a non stationary load evenly the layout of the lamented in two proceedings the ends of the stove the calculations conducted on software security without adaptive integration showed good results the introduction of an anaptia 11111111111111111111111111111111111 of calculations when the cumocation point is located near the element thus the same accuracy of the calculation using modified software when choosing a significant smaller number of boundary elements is achieved 89
