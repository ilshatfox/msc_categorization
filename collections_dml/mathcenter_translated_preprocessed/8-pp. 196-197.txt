the absolute convergence of the ranks of the fourier coefficients according to bases such as faber shauder is well known that the system of faber shauder wor bfsh is the basis in c 0 1 it is generated by one function 2 if m 2 k l then onic onic 2 kx l 1 while it is assumed that ory x is zero outside of the segment 0 1 following the same algorithm you can build gm x systems generated by the function g x and if g x satisfies certain conditions see for example 1 then this system also forms the basis in with 0 1 btfshg a basis of the faber shauder type generated by g x we denote the ag class of continuous functions in which a number of fourier coefficients in btfshg are absolutely converged theorem if for the factors fourier according to btfshg functions t x the rating is fair am t g c 22 k m 2 k l l 1 2 k m 2 1 and c 2 1 1 then ag at note 1 this condition is only sufficient but not necessary so the function t 1 x 4 x 1 x generates the shaidukov base in c 0 1 bs and at 1 aware however theorem 1 for the factors of fourier according to the bfsh function t 1 x are not performed note 2 take as the initial basis of the bfsh while a consequence of theorem 1 will receive if g x c 0 1 and max g 8 then ag a accord note 3 take the bs as the initial basis of the bs to 196 but as a result of theorem 1 we get if g x c 0 1 and max g 48 then ag at 1 a accord in particular this is true if you put g x sin x or g x 8 x x 3 3 and the last function is interesting because it is not symmetrical note 4 if for btfshg the equality of ag aw is true then for these functions all the statements obtained earlier by the author for the functions of class airon are automatically fair in particular they form an algebra l and t r a trarova t saburova about bases in c 0 1 type of faber shauder theory of functions and approaches tr 3 rd sarat winter school 1986 saratov 1988 part 3 c 44 46 2 saburova t n the superposition of functions and their ranks according to the faber shauder system izv academy of sciences of the russian federation a series of mat 1972 t 36 no 2 c 401 423 e kh sadekova e a sevastyanov moscow polynomas approaches in hausdorf metrika let f x limited 2 periodic generally speaking multi digit function with augmented schedule 0 s f x min sup f t x ower t x sup f t x t x i f x max inf inf inf inf f t x t x inf t t x t x inf x s f x i i i i i i i i i f x 2 if in the definition of s f x change min to max and in the definition of i f x max on min then the values of s f x and i f x respectively which by means of equality f sup x s f 2 x i f 2 x the uniform modulus of continuity f of the function is determined f 197
