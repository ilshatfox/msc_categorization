the functions of the mittag lofler and bessel we found that the function of the mittag luffler e z n 0 zn n 0 satisfies the equation in private derivatives z 2 u z 2 u 0 1 found by the method of separation of variables the function u z n 0 cn n z n 2 will be a solution to equation 1 under appropriate conditions for coefficients cn and function t with t 1 t the function 2 satisfies both the equation 1 and the differential strip equation z d dz u z 1 u z u z 3 in particular subject to du z dz u z 1 the equation 3 is reduced to the differential equation z d 2 dz 2 u z d dz uve z u z which can be transformed into the best equation the continuial analogue of the solution 2 of equations 1 is the function represented by the stiltyes integral u z b a c t 1 t ztd t such integral representations under certain conditions on t and t are studied the work was supported by the russian federation project 01 01 01019 and the ministry of defense of the russian federation 227
