materials of the youth school conference udc 004 42 the method of forming a semantic representation of digital mathematical documents p o gafurova 1 1 polina gafurova yahoo com kazan volga federal university institute of mathematics and mechanics n i lobachevsky proposed a method of semantic submission of documents of the digital mathematical collection the design of a semantic description of collections the service for their processing the tools of semantic search and presentation key words semantic web semantics omdoc semantic representation of mathematical documents the work is a continuation of research conducted in 1 and is devoted to the development of methods for introducing semantics into electronic mathematical documents based on the formats omdoc stex and others see e g 2 3 the presence of a large number of sources obliges to present funds for processing information on the internet naturally each sphere of scientific knowledge is characterized by features vramatematimatimromertakkakki designs are theorems lemma evidence and most importantly formulas these designs have their own values and therefore for machine processing it is necessary to include some hidden information in them in particular metadata to process mathematical documents it is necessary to bring them into a semantic appearance the introduction of semantics in web is a distinctive feature of web 3 0 elements of semantics can be found now for example in the german speaking wikipedia also as an example one can note the kwark project aimed at introducing semantics in various documents including mathematical 4 5 to introduce semantics into mathematical documents the kwark project offers the language of submission of mathematical documents omdoc 2 6 omdoc is a document in its structure with a document with mathematical formulas included in it this format was taken by us as the basis for the development of the language of semantic description of mathematical documents this format began to be developed back in 2000 and is still not fully developed since there are problems in mathematical documents that have not yet been solved 7 despite the fact that the format began to be developed a long time ago there are no works related to the visual presentation of documents in this language the language is the basis for some other outproots of the kwark project however it is possible to use the transformations to withdraw information from the file to the screen 1 5 for the semantic representation of the formulas mathml language also based on xml 8 is usually used mathml does not work in all browsers which makes it difficult to use this language as a language of the presentation of mathematical documents for this submission of theamathetic documents of p o gafurova 43 fig 1 the scheme of the semantic presentation of the digital collection document in the web uses mathjax a language that does not support the semantics but is reproduced by all modern browsers for a semantic description of the digital mathematical collection we proposed a language based on xml see for example 9 this language has the following structure each book is described by tag bok and contains metadata tags author title sayar publisher as well as the content tag this tag contains basic information on the book without losing the structural component of the text paragraphs and chapters have their own strict position in the text in paragraphs there are substantial tags for describing as mathematical structures definition def lemma romm theorem teor axiom ax example ex so not mathematical tag article mathematical tags also have their own strict location and structure a brief name full text or alternative text includes in each mathematical object also evidence is given in the case of theorems and an alternative evidence and consequences are possible to transmit mathematical formulas in the created presentation language presentation mathml is used see e g 8 10 however in connection with the problems with the display in the browsers it was necessary to solve the problem of converting into 44 materials of the youth school conference of mathjax to do this an application in python was written which when reading from the code file mathml performs the transformation into mathjax result in fig 2 this application is based on the use of a strict structure ofmathml when reformatting it in mathjax rice 2 the input data and the result of the work of the program with the next step is to create a web application in the php language in order to output documents of the collection on the screen and semantic search for them the web application displays two pages the first page of choosing a category and the term fig 3 rice 3 a pile of selection of category and the term in the list must be selected in which category of the user wants to search as well as drive a search query into the text field and press the button next the beam occurs
