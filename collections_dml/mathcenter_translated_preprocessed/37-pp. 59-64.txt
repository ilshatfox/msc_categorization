one class of self like sets in the work 2 introduced the concept of the upper address for the system of iterized functions sif the following set of sif 0 1 g 0 g 1 where g 0 g 1 0 1 0 1 g 0 x tx g 1 x is also considered as an example tx 1 t with various t 0 1 we denote the attorrator of this siep through at well known that for t 0 1 2 at middle kantorovo many with a compression coefficient t located on the segment 0 1 in particular a 1 3 the classic cantoron for t 1 2 1 a lot of at 0 1 denote def 0 0 1 0 1 2 j 0 1 many endless sequences consisting of zeros and units we will call targeted space the element is called the address of point x at if x lim j g 0 g 1 g j 0 simple calculations show that x 1 t icle 0 jtj therefore at f t where f t def 1 t ipp j 0 jt j 60 if with t 0 1 2 the graphs of the functions of f t do not intersect that is the points from the attorrator have the only address then with t 1 2 1 the situation in the root changes fig one rice 1 150 different schedules of the functions of f t among all addresses of the point x at we select the maximum in the lexicographic sense we will call this address the upper at point t it should be noted that this design is closely related to the so called greedy or separation see classical work 6 and 4 as well as with the infinite bundle of bernoulli see classic work 3 and a wonderful review in 5 denote the top deg t 0 1 the upper address in t t def upper address in t our main goal is to describe these sets 61 the next theorem allows you to find many values of parameter t in which the fixed address is the upper one theorem 1 let s transformation of the shift and supk s we denote t positive root of the equation f t 1 t t then top 0 t if the supremum is achieved otherwise the top 0 t now we fix t 1 2 1 and find many upper addresses at this point denote 0 t def t 0 0 many upper addresses at point t starting from scratch it is easy to show that t 0 t t 1 0 t t 11 0 t 1 thus we can limit ourselves to the consideration of the set 0 t theorem 2 let t 1 2 1 then 0 t 0 sk s ness for any k where nah is a quasi top address see 1 a point t 1 t we show that many upper addresses are an invoice of self like sets as in theorem 2 we denote the quasi top address of the point t 1 t through ness consider many finite sequences of zeros and units of the following type t def highlights 2 expers expense 1 1 k n 62 which will be called blocks for example for t 5 1 2 we have 01 and t 0 010 01010 0101010 note that by virtue of the design of quasi top addresses 01 0 1 k 0 inger consequently the t also contains block 0 the next theorem and its consequences give a complete description of the self like structure of the set 0 t which means by force 1 and the entire space of the upper addresses t theorem 3 let 0 t then 0 1 2 where j t and this decomposition is only moreover any infinite sequence of blocks j j 0 corresponds to a certain address from 0 t the investigation 1 the set of 0 t is represented in the form of an accounting disjunctic combination of the sets of the likes like to itself 0 t organt 0 t as soon as we know the structure of t it will vigorously find hausdorfov the dimension of the sets associated with it investigation 2 let t 0 1 2 1 and t 1 0 t 0 then dimh fpi t 1 t 0 ln t 0 ln t 1 where dimh is the dimension see fig 2 63 fig 2 the many upper addresses at point t 0 are interested in comparing the chaotic location of the functions depicted in fig 1 with an ordered set in fig 2 the work is supported by a grant of the german academic exchange service daad and the ministry of education and science of the russian federation as part of the program mikhail lomonosov a 06 16768 l and tr u r a 1 baiocchic komornikv greedy and quasi greedy expansions in non integer bases preprint arxiv 0710 3001 v 1 math nt 2007 2 barnsleym superfractals cambridge cambridge university press 2006 464 p 3 erd s p on a family of symmetric bernolli convolutions amer j match 1939 1939 1939 1939 v 61 p 974 976 4 parryw on the expansions of real numbers acta math acad sci hung 1960 v 11 p 401 416 64 64 5 peresy schlag w solomyakb sixty years of bernoullli convolutions basel birkh user 2000 p 39 65 6 r nyia representations for real numans and their ergodic properties acta math acad sci hung 1957 v 8 p 477 493 n v isaenkova e v zhuzhoma nizhny novgorod state pedagogical university nisaenkova mail ru about trimer dipho nomorphisms
