binary basic splines of the second order s f lukomskii m d myshko we define binary basic splines of the second order indicate an algorithm for construction an interpolation polynomial of the second degree and give an estimate about the regions we also prove that the constructed basic spline is a solution of some refinement equation keywords binary basic spline interpolation polynomial refinement equation udc 517 982 extrapolation properties of interpolation scales k v lykov 1 1 alkv list ru samara national research university named after academician s p the queen describes the connection between interpolation and extrapolation structures it is shown that for a certain class of interpolation spaces obtained by the k method of material interpolation there is also an extrapolation description obtained by the replacement in the interpolation structure of the functionality with a parameterized set of accurate interpolation spaces with characteristic functions t 0 1 in particular on a set of spaces of peter keywords interpolation space interpolation function extrapolation space peter s spaces material interpolation method suppose that a a 0 a 1 is a pair of banakhov i e such a pair of banana spaces that for some hausdorfovs of the topological space t continuous investments a 0 t and a 1 t then for any element x t represented in the form of x x 0 x 1 where x 0 a 0 and x 1 a 1 can be determined by k functional k t x a inf x 0 x 1 x 0 x 1 x x 0 a 0 t x 1 a 1 t 0 using k functional the spaces of the materialk interpolation method are built if f is a banakhov grille of measurable functions on 0 then the a kf space is determined by the condition of the limb of the norm x a kf k t x a f a particular case of such spaces is the spaces of petra a k q 0 1 q 1 urb for which we will use the following norm x q q 1 11 1 q 0 t k t x a q d t t 1 q with q and x urb sup 0 t mm t k t x a 238 materials of the international school conference we also recall that the interpolation function i is a display from the category of all banana pairs to the category of banach spaces which has a property if the linear operator t determined on a 0 a 1 and taking values in b 0 b 1 is limited from ai in bi i 1 2 the same operator is limited from i a to i b if at the same time t i a i b max t a 0 b 0 t a 1 b 1 then the interpolation function is called the characteristic function of the interpolation function is called the function t 0 0 urb determined from the ratio i r 1 t r 1 t r we will now prove the theorem that connects the interpolation and extrapolation structure record x 1 x 2 for two norms will mean that with some constant c 0 independent of element x inequalities c 1 x 1 x 2 c x 1 are performed moreover the uncertainty of one of the norms means the same for another norm theorem suppose that a a 0 a 1 is such a banakh that a 0 a 1 and 0 a 0 where 0 is a combination of all limits in a 1 limited sequences from a 0 the so called replenishment for gallicardo let x the space of the k method of material interpolation x x k t x a f and in addition the operator s f t f t t f t t f t t f t t 2 then for any family i 0 1 of accurate extrapolate functions with characteristic functions i t t there is an extrapolation ratio x x x i log 1 t a e urb t f proof recall see 1 p 11 2 10 that the following investments are a j 1 1 1 i a 1 k urb here a j 1 the space of the j method of material interpolation determined using the j functional j t x a max x a 0 t x a 1 the limb of the norm x a j 1 inf strictly measurable function u t 0 a 0 a 1 see 2 paragraph 3 2 first show that a k 1 c a j 1 k v lykov 239 with a certain constant c 0 which does not depend on 0 1 the right investment is easy to obtain using a strong form of fundamental lemma of the theory of interpolation see 3 according to the fundamental lemma for any x a j 1 there is such an idea x icle 0 u s d s which ux 0 min 1 t s j s u s a d s s k t x a t 0 with some universal constant for such a presentation we get x 1 1 0 t step t x a d t t 1 1 mm 0 t 0 min 1 t s j s u s a d s d t t 1 1 0 0 t min 1 t s d t j s u s a d s 1 1 mm 0 s 1 j s u s a d s s 1 mm 0 s j s u s
