iliterative methods of gradient type for finding quasi free nonlinear operator equations are considered the equation f x 0 where f h 1 h 2 is a non lineociated operator h 1 h 2 the gilberta space in cases where the resolution of the original equation is not guaranteed the task of finding its quasi playing is set i e points x which delivers a minimum to h 1 the functionality of the miserable ffic x 12 f x 2 we believe that instead of the exact operator f x only its approximation f h 1 h 2 which has in the vicinity of r points x about 133 gato gato up to a third order and satisfying the conditions f x f x f x f x f x r where is a known level of error in the task of the operator f x the iteration process of the approximation of the quasi of the quasi x x 0 h 1 xn 1 pm xn ctor f ising xn xn xn ctor 1 where pm is the design operator for fixed closed subspace m h 1 the parameter h 1 satisfies the condition pm e x perf theorem let the initial approximation x 0 is closely close to quasi of the x of the initial equation error is quite small then with suitable constants c l 0 q 0 1 for the sequence xn the ratios are performed xn x lqn c lim n nder xn x c 2 according to 2 produced by the method 1 approaches xn are stabilized at n urb in the vicinity of quasi rejection x radius c thus the problem of the practical implementation of the scheme 1 removes the problem of choosing the moment of stopping iterations a similar 1 process in relation to the case f x 0 was studied earlier in 1 l and t r a tararo bakushinsky a b iterative methods of a gradient type with design for a fixed subspace for solving irregular operator equations zhvm and mf 2000 t 40 no 10 s 1447 1450 m yu kokurin n a yusupova yoshkar ola 134
