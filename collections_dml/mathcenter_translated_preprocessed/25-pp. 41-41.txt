the mathematical and experimental modeling of the echo process in the presence of an anonymous polarized screen solved the task of modeling a stationary electrical chemical shape echo in the presence of anonymous screen in an interelectrodic gap pana mathematical setting of the problem corresponding to the scheme of the interelectic gap of the experimental cell for the echo during the reign of the task the hydrodynamic analogy of the samples of the echo the algorithm for finding the parameters of the problem has been developed and numerical calculations have been completed experimental studies of anode shapes were carried out in the presence of a specified screen in the npc the results showed a satisfactory coincidence of the conclusions of the mathematical and experimental division of the phenomenon on the localization of the echo zone l m berkovich samara berk ssu samara ru nonlinear differential equations some design methods in the report will talk about some analytical methods of research and integrating non linear different differential equations olu as well as an important class of equations from private derivatives namely non linear evolving equations some developed by the author 41 are represented
