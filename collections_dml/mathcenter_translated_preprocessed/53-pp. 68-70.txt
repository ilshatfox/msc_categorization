the method of finding the optimal regression equation we consider multidimensional data where for yj there is a set of variables xji j 1 m i 1 n y x 1 x 2 xn y 1 x 12 x 1 n y 2 x 21 x 22 x 2 n ym xm 1 xm 2 xmn r a galyamov m m minegaliev 69 assumes that y does not depend on all x 1 x 2 xn and from some subset a x 1 x 2 xn and the subset of a is unknown and the dependence of the non linear the work considers the method of finding this dependence in the regression analysis two models are most often considered among all models 1 multiplier y 0 x 1 x k ik 1 2 additative y 0 1 xi 1 kxik 2 classes are studied models lying between 1 and 2 y 0 i 1 x i 1 ikx ik 3 where y f y and x i f xi f fift z ln e z 1 we believe that y is addicted to x by formula 3 the solution to this problem is using the maximum credibility method the function of credibility has the form l a 1 2 m e y x a 2 2 2 where y j f yj y y 1 y m x a is a matrix that is from the elements x ji 1 6 j 6 m i a x j 0 1 such as x ji f xji vector 0 1 k we find the values and such that the function l a is maximum after the substitution of these values we get l a 1 2 m y x a x a 1 x a yx a 2 m m 2 e m 2 70 p o gafurov so our method is as follows we find a lot of a and so that the confidence interval i does not contain 0 and the average quadratic error y x a x a 1 x a yx a 2 m was the smallest then the set of a and and x ax a 1 x ay are the optimal parameters in the equation 3 in the sense that they maximize the function of credibility in the assumption that trust intervals are not equal zero the proposed methods are illustrated by example other fift functions when optimizing the equation y 0 1 x 1 nx n are considered in 1 l and t r a t r a 1 aivazyans a economics methods m infra m 2010 509 c p o gafurov kazan volga federal university polina mannshtern mail ru the method of processing mathematical documents in omdoc currently developing the internet is largely due to semantic processing of information see e g 1 os is a new problem when processing text files incomplete structuring and differences in the grammatical buildings of different languages a document created in the tex note also
