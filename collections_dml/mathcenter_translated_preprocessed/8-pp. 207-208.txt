variation measures in the theory of integral henstoka method in the theory of integral allows you to describe a wide class of generalized integrals in terms of variation regarding this differential basis generated by the function of the interval in henstok theory the differential basis b is defined as a family filtering to include of the subset of the descartes work j rn where j is a lot of intervals in rn for the function of the interval wor for each element basis b and for the set e rn the version of the function wor on e var onic e sup onic i where the amount is distributed to the set of non disclosure is determined intervals i for which i x and x e and sup is taken in all 207 such sets the value of v accord edb var onic e is called the variational measure of the set e relative to the basis of the function ffic ffic it is easy to check that v accord is a metric outer measure the concept of a variation measure allows the following descriptive characteristic of the uncertain integral of henstok regarding some bases the additive function of the interval f is an uncertain integral of henstok regarding the basis b and only when the corresponding variation measure generated by the function f is absolutely continuous regarding the measure of the lebeg in this case the differentiation of function f follows from absolute continuity from this point of view a wide class of bases is considered in 1 among the new results in this direction we note the result regarding the approximative integral of henstok see 2 the work was supported by the rffif projects 99 01 00355 00 15 96143 and grant of the institute of mathematics of the city of bydgosh inst mat bydgoszcz poland l and t r a t r a 1 bongorno b di piazza l skvortsov v a anal appl in print 2 skvortsov v a blutovski p o the variation of the variation of a variational determined by an approximative differential basis bulletin of moscow state university ser mat fur in print v f snigirev kazan variant of a two dimensional functional splan for interpoing a function known in the arbitrarily located nodes of a two dimensional mesh two dimensional functional splashes are most effective 1 4 paid at the same time yav 208
