the formulation of the generalized task of the theory of filtering in the presence of a point source discusses nonlinear stationary tasks of the filter of the walkie talkie in the arbitrary area in the presence of a point source in particular the tasks of filtering with the maximum gradient with the explosive law of filtration etc it is assumed that the function that defines the law of filtration has linear growth at infinity the generalized task in this case is formulated in the form of an equation or variational inequality with the opera of the thor acting in the calbert space v functions that have the first generalized derivative integrated with a square see for example 1 modeling spot sources is natural to introduce delta function at one as you know in a repeated case the delta function does not belong to the conjugated space of v which does not allow the use of existing generalized productions at the same time for a number of special filtering areas from the news solving some problems in the presence of spot sources for example 2 in this work an approach is proposed to overcome the indicated difficulty by introducing a new generalized setting the work was supported by the rfff projects 03 01 00380 04 01 00821 and the russian ministry of education of the russian ministry of education project e 02 1 o 189 literature 1 lyashko a li karchevsky m m diverse methods of solving no income task theory of filtering izv university matte 1983 no 7 with 28 45 2 bernandiner m g v m hydrodins are a theory of abnormal liquids m nauka 1975 199 p 119
