filtering convection in the channel with local heating and cooling the walls of e i kalinin a b mazo kazan state university kalininei yandex ru the topic of the report is a numerical study of convective processes in a porous environment that arises in a tilt channel with local heating and cooling the walls the channel of a single width is considered inclined to go risontali on the angle fig 1 rice 1 on the boundaries of 3 and 4 the temperatures of 1 and 1 are maintained respectively the boundaries 1 and 2 are thermal insulated at the entrance the temperature of the liquid is zero 116 the descartes coordinates with an axis x is used on the channel corrected along the lower boundary of the channel the mathematical model of the studied process is based on the darsy law and the equation of convective thermal conductivity within the framework of the bouredinel and linear law of thermal expansion the fluid course is described by the following equations system 1 2 t t v gradt 1 pe t 1 ose g t x cos t y sin 2 vx y vy x 3 here t is the temperature of the liquid t time v vx vy the speed of the current pe the number of bee g gravitational number the problem was solved numerically by the method of final elements the rectangle 0 12 0 1 was accepted for the calculation area at the same time cooling and heating occurred at the boundaries at 3 x 7 in fig 2 a presents the current lines const in the channel at 0 pe 1 g 20 it can be seen that closed vortex cells are formed at the entrance and exit from the heating and coolation zone with an increase in the angle of inclination to 90 the symmetry of the course relative to the axis of the channel is destroyed in fig 2 b shows the case of the course in the strictly vertical channel 90 pe 1 g 3 in the cooled area we observe the formation of one vortex with 90 the current acquires instability due to the fact that the heated boundary turns out to be cooled this can lead to motor coaling processes consisting in continuous education movement and destruction of vortices inside the heating coilization zone 117 in fig 2 c shows such a case in the horizontal channel at 180 pe 1 g 30 fig 2 the picture of the current fundamentally depends on the parameters pe g and in fig 3 shows the curves g g and g g pe separating the currents in which closed via are the crooked structures g g correspond to zone 1 from those in which closed vortex the cells do not arise g g they responsible zone 2 90 0 90 1 2 3 1 2 g pe 10 600 1200 0 10 20 2 1 pe g 0 fig 3 118 work was carried out with the support of the rffi project 04 01 00484 l and t r a t r a 1 sebisi t bredshaw p convective heat transfer m mir 1987 597 p 2 merkin j h zhang g on the similarity solutions for free conversation in a saturated porous medium adjacent to impermeable horizontal surface warme ind staffubertr 1990 no 25 p 179 184 3 piva s barozzi g s collins m w combined free and forced conversation in horizontal flows a review computation analysis of conversation heat transfer wit press southampton boston 2000 432 p on the numerical method of solving the mixed reverse edge problem of aerohydrodynamics i m kamalutdinov nimm named after n g chebotareva kazan state university islamui mi ru in direct regional tasks of aerohydrodynamics of the roof profile is considered known and it is required to find its aerodynamic characteristics with the specified parameters of the emerging flow in the reverse tasks the wing profile is found according to the distribution of speed or pressure set on its circuit such tasks are incorrect in adamaru and to solve them the kva kva method is successfully used 1 the marginal task of aerohydrodynamics is called mixed if the part of the wing contour is known in advance about 119
