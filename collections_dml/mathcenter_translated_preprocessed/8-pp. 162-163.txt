conformal displays of circular polygons let the limited single link area b are given in a complex w plaque different from the circle the boundary of the region b consists of the final number of arcs of concentric circles and the final number of segments lying on the rays emerging from the center of circles the center of circles coincides with the beginning of the coordinates and belongs to the region region b generally speaking is not starry relative to the beginning of the coordinates in the work a differential equation was obtained regarding the function displaying a single circle to the region b the resulting differential equation contains unknown constant which are not directly determined by the form of the region b we note that the areas under consideration are a special case of circular polygons for which the corresponding differential equation relative to the displaying function it known as the differential equation of schwartz 162 has a more complex appearance l and t r a t r a 1 golubev v v lectures on the analytical theory of differential equations m l gittl 1950 2 malanina e v displays to the circular polygons of ki issl mat analysis and algebra tomsk tsu 2001 s 174 178 in print a n malyutin tomsk about display with a s summized characteristic consider f d rn where d rn denote through k 0 x f ki x f external and internal dilatation of display f definition display f is called the display with k i s summified characteristic s 0 if 1 display f continuous isolated class w 1 n loc d and jacobian j x f 0 almost everywhere in d 2 there is a constant k i s 0 such that k i s f d ki x f j x f s 1 x 2 ndx 1 s k i s let the family of curves in d determination non progressive borelev function call the permissible metric for the family if x n x i dord x 1 x 2 1 for each for each curve 163
