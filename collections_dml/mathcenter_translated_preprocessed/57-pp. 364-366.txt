materials of the school conference of udc 517 9 ultraproduction of probabilistic measures in the space of states c algebr s g haliullin 1 1 samig haliulin kpfu ru the kazan volga federal university discusses the probabilistic measures of radon set in the space of the conditions of some algebra ultraproductions of sequenic measures are also considered studying the structure of the states of states algebr and its extreme points in itself is an interesting task but if we consider the ultraproduction of such algebra and conditions on them then we get quite non trivial results keywords measure of radon ultraproduction let k a convex compact subset of the material locally swollen topological vector space x c k the space of all material continuous functions on k it is well known that c k is the vector space above the field r and that the function is f sup f x there is a norm in this space that turns c k into a banakh space in addition c k is a switching algebra over the field r and the topology determined by the norm is consistent with the structure of this algebra determination 1 see for example 1 a measure of radon in a compact space k is the continuous linear form in the banach space k in this case the value of the form for the continuous function f is called the integral from f relative to and is recorded in the form of f k f x d x f c k x k the measure of radon is called positive if f 0 for all f 0 the positive measure of radon is called probabilistic if k 1 the set of all the probabilistic measures of radon on the set k denocate m 1 k each positive extent radon clearly corresponds to the algebra f k the so called measurable subset of the compact hausdorfov spaces under consideration any set a f k is then compared by the non negative number a called the measure of the set a in this case the measure is the borelevsky measure on k and the rice theorem establishes a mutually monk correspondence between the many borelevsky measures and the measures of radon on k further everywhere we will assume that k is a convex subsets of many states ea a some c algebra a which is compact in the sloba of topology each probabilistic measure m 1 k has a barcenter center of gravity see for example 2 b k d s g haliullin 365 if b then they say that represents the state it is clear that the measure of dirac always represents on many positive measures of radon the attitude of the partial order is introduced f f for all continuous convex functions on k it is known 2 that if 1 k and then b b each state is a barcenter of some measure 1 k which is maximum in the sense of the introduced order in physical applications the most important is the unity of the state of measure it is also known 3 that if k is a non empty convex subsets of the locally convex space x and point k then is the extreme point k in that if the measure of dirac spot mass is it is the only probabilistic measure on k representing determination 2 2 compact convex set k which serves as the basis for cone c is called a symplex if c is a grate it is known 2 that if k is a convex compact subset of the separated local convex space then any point k is the ramp of the only maximum 1 k measures and only if k is a symplex determination 3 see for example s heinrich 4 let n n arbitrary non empty sets u non trivial ultrafilter in the set of n the factor many work of the decartes work of the sets an n n the ratio of equivalence an u bn n n an bn u is called theoretical ultraproduction of the settings an and is indicated an u determination 4 4 consider the sequence hn n banach spaces ultraproduction hn u is the factor space linger n hn nu where lip n hn hn hn hn submin hn nu hn lux n hn limu hn 0 it is well known see s heinrich 4 that if kn is compact hausdorfs of space then there is such a compact hausdorfo space k that ultraproduction c kn u is a linearly isometrically isometrically space c k this isometry also retains multiplier and lattice structures therefore the space c kn u can be identified as some c k and we call this space by the ultra work of spaces c kn at the same time ultraproduction theoretical many kn u homeomorpho dense subset k let kn ean the space of the states of some c algebra an n n the condition on the ultraproduction of the sequence c algebr a call u
