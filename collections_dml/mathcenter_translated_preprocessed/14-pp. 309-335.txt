non newtonian fluids with jump discontinuities different types of models describing the spreading of a fluid film with an initial surface jump and leading to discontinuous solutions are considered using the symmetry properties of these models solutions describing the following situations are found spreading of a film over a flat horizontal surface flow from an inclined surface onto a horizontal plane flow over a step like surface and spreading of a film subject to local mass sources all determined discontinuous solutions are illustrated by graphs obtained by numerical calculations their physical interpretation is given for the case that the film forms part of an ice sheet or glacier 1 introduction the motion of thin films whose longitudinal dimension is much larger than the transversal extent is a classical field of study of fluid dynamics in a variety of applications for example for sufficiently large time scales all existing ice sheets and glaciers can be considered as thin layers of a non linear viscous fluid shumskii 1969 fowler and larson 1978 hutter 1983 salamatin and mazo 1984 moreover 315 many modern technological applications make in one form or another use of flows of thin films of non newtonian fluids in these under certain conditions surface tension can play an important role however if the gravity force is much larger than the force caused by surface tension large bond numbers then surface tension can be ignored hocking 1980 therefore for the purpose of this work let us consider only situations when this condition is satisfied that is we will assume that surface tension is negligible many physical processes associated with film flows are described by sharp changes of their main characteristics fluid thickness and mass flux in some small regions for example the layer thickness experiences a jump when the fluid flows over a surface with a step moreover a change of the slip law leads to a sharp change of the upper surface slope a situation giving rise to a sharp change of the horizontal mass flux is the existence of strong mass sources or sinks on the surfaces and inside the film acting in regions much smaller than the typical longitudinal scales such a situation may arise e g when a glacier suddenly and locally receives accumulated mass from an ice fall of a hanging glacier above it for the description of the above situations it is natural to consider models which allow solutions in which a field variable or its space or time derivative may experience a jump discontinuity one example with such solutions is well known fowler 1984 and deals with the reduction of the mathematical model describing the propagation of surface waves to a nonlinear first order partial differential equation from a mathematical point of view solutions with jumps are natural for hyperbolic equations and their existence is evident the situation is different when more complex models described by parabolic equations are considered in this case the existence of a solution with jumps is not evident so it should be no surprise that in an extensive list of works studied by us such solutions were not considered because the number of models of film flows admitting solutions with jumps is far too large let us restrict attention to models describing the diffusive spreading of a film which starts initially with a jump in its surface elevation this choice is motivated by the following reasoning first one particular model demonstrates that if the boundary conditions are regular then the solution is smooth even for an initially discontinuous surface elevation second such models describe possible realistic situations and third they possess certain symmetries allowing a qualitative analysis a model or a system is said to admit a symmetry if its equations remain invariant with regard to a certain group of transformations ovsyannikov 1969 olver 1986 stephani 1989 ibragimov 2000 every invariance group of transformations is generated by a corresponding operator called infinitesimal operator which one is actually searching for for the equation describing the dynamics of the free surface of a fluid film obeying a power law stress stretching relation all possible symmetries 316 were found by chugunov 1982 and one of them is described by the infinitesimal operator x n 1 t t x x 1 it is the appropriate operator for the spreading of a film with initial step like profile over a flat horizontal plane without slip chugunov 1995 this discussion suggests to us to formulate the aim of this work as follows to consider models admitting the symmetry 1 in order to show existence of solutions with jumps and to discuss their physical interpretation to this end we shall in the second section discuss the governing dynamical equations of the film surface for a number of different situations of the film motion whe
