comparison of triangular variety schemes with methods of high order of accuracy in solving the convection diplomatic equation 1 so called subbotina south russian regional center for informatization of higher school g rostov on don 1 introduction in recent years has been there to an sharp increase in computing capabilities of computer technology and at the same time increased interest with the mathematical modeling of various physical processes so when modeling the transfer of matter in the air or in water it is necessary to solve the non stationary equation of convection disengage it is known that in the presence of a small parameter with a senior derivative i e in the dominance of convective processes the task is complicated especially if the solution contains internal or border layers for such tasks a large number of obvious and implicit variable schemes were developed 1 5 the triangular oblique variable schemes proposed in this work belong to the class of circuits that effectively solve problems because triangular matrices are easily reversible and do not require a large number of arithmetic actions at the same time it is shown that under the fulfillment of certain conditions different circuits with such an operator are stable theoretical studies are based on the well known results of the theory of stability of operator growth schemes and operator inequalities 6 7 numerical experiments were carried out for the convection of dissection with a small parameter with a senior derivative with four different speed fields and for a task with solving the type of border layer of particular interest is the comparison of the results of the work of triangular schemes with a high cost schemes with the support of the rffi project no 03 01 00005 a and about the grams of universities of russia project no 03 01 019 226 subbotine ka 8 9 allowing you to effectively solve problems with complex velocities or with border layers the results set forth in the article are fair for the variable space operators with the property of dissipativity that is for non self intended operators in which the symmetrical part is positively determined different operators with such properties can be obtained during approximation of a fairly wide class of scientific and technical problems associated with convection and diffusion processes such as the hydrodynamics of viscous inconspicuous fluids the spread of substances and the distribution of temperature in the atmosphere in water bodies etc 10 2 the setting of the problem and methods for solving it is the dynamic problem of convective disjudicial transfer of the substance in the case of two spatial variables can be written in a symmetrical form given the inconsistency of the environment div v 0 ices t 1 pe accord 1 2 v 1 accord x v 1 x v 2 ular v 2 y f onic t 0 0 x y d d 0 1 0 1 2 1 in the equation 2 1 v v 1 x y v 2 x y the vector of the speed of the environment the first term corresponds to the dynamics of the task the second term diffusion transfer and the rest convective transfer f f x y t after the approximation of the spatial derivatives of equations 2 1 on the standard five point template where the convective part is approximated by the central differences we get the operator growth scheme 6 b yk 1 yk ayk fk k 0 1 2 2 y 0 u 0 2 3 227 comparison of triangular diverse schemes here a b linear operators matrices in h h the material final free calbert space f y 0 h y 0 the initial condition yk the solution of the problem 2 1 on the k m step by time is a step according to time 2 1 triangular oblique schemes we present the matrix a in the form of the sum of the symmetrical and oblique parts a a 0 a 1 a 0 0 5 a a a 1 0 5 a a a 1 kb kh where kb is kb and kh the upper and lower triangular parts of the matrix a 1 kb k h following the basic idea to determine the operator b with an easily reversible matrix we put b e k where k kb or k kh 10 2 then the matrix corresponding to the operator b will have a triangular structure note that the symmetrical b 0 and the kosmimetric part of the operator b e kh have the form b 0 e 0 5 kh kb b 1 a 1 consider the transition operator s in the assumption that b 0 b 0 0 s b 1 b a b 0 b 1 1 b 0 b 1 a 0 a 1 b 0 a 1 1 b 0 a 0 b 1 2 0 e p 1 1 e p 0 b 1 20 here p 0 b 1 2 0 a 0 b 1 2 0 p 0 2 4 p 1 b 1 2 0 a 1 b 1 2 0 p ys 1 2 5 thus the operator s is similar to the operator e p 1 1 e p 0 going to the equivalent of equivalent errors for the vector yk b 1 2 0 xk we get s b 0 e p 1 1 e p 0 theorem 2 1 let the operator a non self intended the operator b has the form b e r a 1 r j kh kb j 1 1 b 0 e r b 0 0 then for the stability of the variety of senctors 2 2 according to the initial data in the energy space 228 so called subbotin hb 0 is enough for e p 1 1 e p 0 6 1 where p 0 and p 1 are set by formulas 2 4 and 2 5
