an analogue of levner s equation for displaying stripes d a dubovikov volgograd state university dubovikov gmail ru the levner equation arose in the famous work of 1923 and in connection with an attempt to solve the problem of the coefficients ge metrically described the washing of the cut in terms of context display with riemann s standardization subsequently this equation was summarized in connection with the solution of various ex three problems in the transition to the boundary normalizers analogues of the leuner equation for half flipped with hydrodynamic standardization and for the strip when fixed 80 two boundary points see 1 arose since such generalizations were focused on creating variations in the corresponding classes of conformal display the design associated with the washing of the cut was absent on the other side the new applications of the levner equation such as sle are based on this design see for example 2 in a standing job the issue of obtaining an analogue of the levner equation for the strip is studied let z 0 im z f conformal display of the strip in itself then there are limits of c f lim re z z f z where z changes in the underpoint we will be interested in the case of the unnecessary c f we denote through t the totality of the conformal transformations of the strip which analytically break through the material axis into the strip z im z leave the invariant material axis and satisfy the condition f 0 0 let f f c f c f theorem 1 let f t 0 f ln 3 it is for the god of the compact k in the strip there is a constant m k such that z k f z z 6 f m k let z t 0 t t a simple zordanov cree in the strip with continuous parameterization im t we denote dt t where t is part of the curve from t to t in this case there is the only conformal disposal ft dt from class t we select the course of time so that ft t t theorem 2 let ft be defined as before then t ft z nt z ez 1 ez ek t 1 1 e k t 81 where k t f 11 t t i l and t r a t r a 1 goryainov v v half groups of conformal display matem sat 1986 no 129 171 4 s 451 472 2 rohde s schramm o basic properties of sle ann math 2005 v 161 no 2 p 879 920 the task of building a profile streamlined with a feature of o s dunaev nimm named after n g chebotareva kazan state university oneberova yandex ru in the tasks of aerohydrodynamics some interest in the flow of wing profiles in the presence of features of the type of source and vortex in the stream the task of constructing a wing profile in the presence of features of the type of vortex in the stream is solved by m t nugin 1 16 the whirlwind was used in order to replace the dick or click this approach allowed to find an analytical solution to the problem and derive the conditions for its resolution but the issue of fulfilling the conditions for resolving the task that is the isolation of the desired contour of the profile and the coincidence of the given speed the flooding flow with the value found in the solution process remained open with the use of the quasi extension method the task of constructing a profile with a click replaced by a single motionlessly fixed vortex was solved in the work 2 this work is devoted to solving the reverse edge problem of aerohydrodynamics in the presence of a vortex of nickname in private cases of which are a source and a whirlwind 82
