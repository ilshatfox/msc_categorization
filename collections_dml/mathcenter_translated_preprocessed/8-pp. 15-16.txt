solving one generalized problem of the gazeman type for bianalytic functions in the parabolic case if the final single link area on the plane of the complex alternating z x iy limited by a simple smooth closed contour l through t denote the addition of t l to a complete comprehensive plane the following task is considered see also 1 it is required to find all the piece of bonalytic functions f z f z f z class a 2 t h 2 l f 0 0 f 0 satisfying on l the next regional conditions f t x 2 k yk 1 gk 1 t f t x 2 k yk 1 gk 2 t f t x 2 k yk 1 gk t k 1 2 1 where gkj t gk t k 1 2 j 1 2 the functions set on l satisfy the helder condition along with their derivatives up to about 3 k inclusive and gkj t 6 0 on l t preserves orientation of the homeomorphism of the contour l on itself and t 6 0 on l is known see for example 1 that any piece of bonalytic function with a line of jumps l can be represented in the form of f z f z onic 0 z z wor 1 z z t f z 0 z z 1 z z t 2 where ventral z 1 z gment 0 z 1 z analytical in t t functions called the analytical components of the bianalytic function f z f z in this message using the presentation 2 it is established that if gk 1 t gk 2 t k 1 2 a parabolic case for the problem 1 then the solution of the problem in question is reduced to solving the two problems of hilbert internal and 15 external and the marginal problem of the gazeman with integral members regarding the piece of analytical functions l and t r a 1 rasulov k m m the sore tasks for polyanalytic pounds and some of their applications smolensk sspu 1998 343 p l a apaicheva nizhnekamsk b g gabdulkhaev kazan optimization of the quadrature formulas in the class of functions hk with a singular integral with the keelbert nucleus j x s 1 2 2 0 ctg s 2 x d x f c 2 1 understood in the sense of the main value of koshi the quadrature formulas k f of the type jn x s 1 n n k 1 ak s are placed in accordance x sk n n 2 where sk sk n n 1 is an arbitrary system of pair of non excessive nodes ak ak n s arbitrary continuous functions and f x is some class of densities we denote through vn f inf sk ak sup xorn x s jn x s c 2 3 the optimal assessment 1 class errors k f 1 in the class f specific k f j 0 n x s with nodes sk s 0 k and functions ak a 0 k k 1 n is called optimal asymptically optimal and optimal in order if conditions are fulfilled 16
