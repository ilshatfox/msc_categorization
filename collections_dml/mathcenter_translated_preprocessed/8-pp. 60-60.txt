the design of the wing profile of the screen planet by the method of complex variable functions in the work studies the effect of the screen on the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing profile by solving the reverse edge problem of aerohydrodynamics as the initial speed distribution a modified speed distribution from the surface of the plate above the screen is selected initially a direct task was considered to calculate the flow of the plate above the screen with a flat parallel deadless stream in the assumption of the hypothesis of zhukovsky chaplygin the analytical solution of this problem obtained by l i sedov 1 was implemented in the form of a program and the aerodynamic characteristics of the plate were calculated depending on the defense of the plate from the screen and on the angle of attack the case of the contact of the plate with the screen is considered when the half plate with an emitted inclined segment conformally is displayed in half a sophistication the resulting distribution of speed over the surface of the plate was modified namely the infinite value of the speed was replaced by the final one having set this new distribution as the initial and using the profile program compiled in the nimm regional tasks department they received a solution to the reverse problem in the presence of a screen the built solution was implemented in numerically and the report shows the results of the calculations the work was supported by the rfff project 99 01 00365 and the program universities of russia l and t r a t r a 1 sedov l i flat tasks of hydrodynamics and aerodyns of ki m science 1966 448 p 60
