the phenomenon of gibbs for interpolation polynomas of the functions is well known see 1 p 126 the phenomenon of gibbes for the often dimensions with a limited change in its isolation points of the gap at the same time the constant gibbs is 1 17 let tp f x interpolation with pauline with equivos with boxes 7 r 2 k 1 2 n l k o 1 p functions f x with a limited change the gibbs effect is also observed for the polynomas tn j x constant gibb ca in this case is 1 06 there is an asymptotic formula 7 r 2 sin 2 tp f x 2 1 g du o l n 1 x ssh and about 158 p a korolkov 2 1 j sin 2 zu 2 du o l z ssh and 1 o x o and p oo formula 1 and the effect of gibbs are first installed for function 00 fo x lbksinkx k l if lk 1 k 2 k 1 2 and then transferred to the production functions of limited variation literature 1 vari n k trigonometru ch socials tasks for harmonic functions in riman varieties with the ends of the work examine the functions and e jni m on many images of m with the ends here ini m the space of harmonies on the functions that are limited on the one hand at each end of diversity let 1 ld capacitive in the tentyal of the end of di and vd l potential of the end d 1 see 1 go that the end of di has a parabolic type if ud o otherwise they say they say that the end di has hyperboly t ip
