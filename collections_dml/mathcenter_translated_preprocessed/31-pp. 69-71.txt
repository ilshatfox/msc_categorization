one method of the approximate solution of integrated equations of scattering theory based on periodic bursts k g zverev kazan state university zverev pai ru modeling of physical processes associated with the spread of electromagnetic waves is based on maxvella equations a number of tasks in particular the tasks of scattering waves by periodic structures can be formulated in the form of regional tasks for the helmholtz equation 1 2 these tasks are unambiguously solved in the class of quasiperiodic functions with partial radiation conditions at infinity 1 iu 69 tod of integral equations allows you to reduce the edge tasks to integral equations of the second kind the latter can be considered at one period 3 the work discusses the edge tasks in areas with a periodic wavy border for example y k sin x d periodic bursts are used to build a periodic solution of the integral equation equivalent to the regional problem 4 to substantiate the algorithm of a close solution in the work a variant of the general theory of close methods is used 5 l and t r a tsang l ding k h ao c a scattering of electromagnetic waves numerical simulations new york wiley interscience 2001 705 p 2 ilyinsky a s kravtsov v v sveshnikov a g mathematical models of electrodynamics m higher school 1991 3 kolton d korus r methods of integral equations in the theory of scattering m mir 1987 311 p 4 pan g w wavelets in electromagnetics and device modeling new york wiley interscience 2003 532 p 5 gabdulkhaev b g the optimal approximation of solutions of linear problems kazan publishing house of kazan un tee 1980 232 p connectedness on almost paraceums v yu zinchenko nizhny novgorod state university named after n i lobachevsky vera zinchenko inbox ru 70 let answers e p b t k the main stratification with the projection p e b and the structural group t k rk zk r b b the action of the final group on the basis of b the purpose of the work is the study of the multi digit lifts of the action of r into the space of the stratification hole agreed with the action of the structural group t k similar designs were studied in 1 for the case of smooth stratification here we consider b and e just fairly good topological spaces for example polyhedrings or cellular complexes suppose that the coating of u base b is invariant regarding the action of r and there is an atlas a u of stratification hole associated with it for cards v a u with u v 6 and elements consider the functions of the transition lection u v t k ising to and put v u uv r determination 1 let the display v u u v t k are locally constant for all u v u and then a u we will agree to call almost atlas two such atlases will be considered equivalent if their association is also almost atlas if a is the equivalence class of almost atlas a u then a pair lection a will call almost parace for cards u t k eu p 1 u we determine the actions of ru eu eu with the formula ru a t a t determination 2 cremr ru u u we will be called pseudo activity and in the case when a u is almost atlas the multi digit effect of the group on e continuous section h the stratification p ei q where q x v bi e x 0 p v ei and bi are the spaces of ways in e and b and p y p y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y 0 is called t k binding on lection if h x v t h x v t for all x v q and t t k 2 71
