the differentiation of classic algebrists lee over the field of characteristics 2 in the work describes the differentiation of classic algebrians lee over the field of characteristics 2 for a simple algebra lee above the field characteristics 0 any differentiation is internal under the classic algebra lee above the field of non equal characteristics we understand the algebra of whether a simple algebraic group or its factor algebra in the center classic algebras of the type an bn cn dn above the field characteristics 2 their properties are largely different from the properties of the corresponding algebra over the field characteristics 0 in particular external differentiations appear in the work the dimensions of the spaces of external differentiations of all the algebra considered were found and the databases of these spaces were built theorem 1 let l algebra type an above the field f characteristics 2 n 1 l factor algebra l in the center if n 1 then dim h 1 l dim h 1 l l 4 if n 3 then dim h 1 l 1 dim h 1 l 7 if n is even then h 1 l l h 1 l l 0 if n 3 is odd then dim h 1 l l dim h 1 l 1 theorem 2 let l algebra type bn above the field f characteristics 2 n 2 l factor algebra l in the center if n 2 then dim h 1 l 5 dim h 1 l l 6 if n 3 then dim h 1 l 1 dim h 1 l 16 59 if n 3 then dim h 1 l 1 dim h 1 l 2 n 2 theorem 3 let l algebra type cn above the field f characteristics 2 n 3 l is the factor of algebra l in the center then dim h 1 l l 2 n 1 dim h 1 l l 1 theorem 4 let l algebra type dn above the field f characteristics 2 n 4 l factor algebra l in the center if n is odd then dim h 1 l 1 dim h 1 l l 2 n 1 if n 4 even then dim h 1 l 2 dim h 1 l l 2 n 2 if n 4 then dim h 1 l 2 dim h 1 l 26 the work was performed with financial support for the rffif project no 02 0100725 m l platonov tyumen platonov tgu ru several results about e prisoners and p dedication of computable numbering let and two computable numberings of the set s they say that e prisoner p dwarf to if there is such a recursive number w the general meshursive function f that s 1 s x y x y w y s s respectively s 1 s x y y df x dy 1 s where x y cantor number of the pair x y of natural numbers from n and dn the canonical number of the final subset n the existence of computable families of the final sets and the overall functions that do not have e main numbering in the work 1 it is noted that there is a calculated numbering family 0 1 0 1 2 3 0 3 to which the p vydima is inexplicable it is further proved that 1 if some numbering p provar is computable the numbering of the three element family of recursive and permitted sets then it is computable 60
