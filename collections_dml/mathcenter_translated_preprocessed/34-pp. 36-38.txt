resolving the problem of the drum by m g volynskaya samara university volyn 79 mail ru the study of the oscillations of the drum membrane leads to mathematical modeling to the next task for a loaded hyperbolic equation utt urr 1 r ur 2 r 0 0 ru r t dr r s 0 r 0 t 0 t 1 u r 0 t 0 2 u r 0 po r 3 ut r 0 r 4 u 0 t mm 5 where is constant 38 temporarily counting the function f t 2 r 0 0 ru r t dr is known the solution of the task can be obtained by fourier it is shown that the method of separating variables leads to the task of the assault liuville for the equation of the bessel which are the functions of the bessel j 0 kr r 0 using the shafheitlin theorem 3 p 540 on the properties of the roots of k the functions of bessel j 0 x as well as the conditions for the convergence of some rows of fourier bessel 1 p 295 it was possible to show that the function f t satisfies the voltaire equation second kind f t t 0 2 r 30 f n 1 1 3 n sin n t r 0 d g r t 6 where g r t is expressed through known functions due to the equalities of the row our n 1 3 n sin n t r 0 the kernel core 6 is continuous and limited which entails the existence of the only solution to this integral equation 2 p 228 thus the task 1 5 becomes a classic laughing task proof of the uniqueness of the solution of the problem 1 5 is based on the received a priori assessment r 0 0 r u 2 t r t u 2 r r t dr 6 0 39 l and t e r and t u r a 1 tolstov a n rows fourier m 1972 2 krasnov m l integral equations m 1975 3 vatson g n theory of bessel functions m 1949 absolute parallel transfer to the point often surface of a v vyalov kaliningrad state technical university olga omelyan 2002 mail ru in the n dimensional projective space pn pn plate bone surface sh r seems to be a degenerate multipline of three a lh tm and point a a lh tm and the tangent plane tm m h r describe the m seniority and the forming lh is the r dimensional family 1 with the top of sh r the main stratification g sh r is associated the base of which is the surface itself and the typical layer is under the group of hospital stationaries the point excavated surface can be represented by the stratification of lh br with the base the grace of the br forming lh considered as elements of the variety of the grassman gr h n and the typical layer the family point of the plane of the lh plane therefore the variety of points of the fixed generator lh sh r is the narrowed base of the stratification g sh r group connectedness in the main stratification g sh r is set using the field of connectedness 1 about the composite equipment 1 of the point excavation surface is picked up which consists in the connection of the surface of the three planes of the three planes ph 1 pm h 1 pn m 1 about the drawing of 40 respectively 40
