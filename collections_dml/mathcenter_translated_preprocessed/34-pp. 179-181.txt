clarifications of the inequality of fire jackson a a putintsev bashkir state university mail bashedu ru in 1910 fayer put forward a hypothesis of the justice of negligence n k 1 sinkx k 0 0 x n 1 2 in 1911 jackson proved the validity of this inequal therefore it is called the inequality of fire jackson since then the generalizations of this inequality were devoted to many 181 st works see review in 1 2 for example the above negligence was improved by a 4 sin 2 x 2 touran ctg x 2 x 2 n k 1 sin kx k 0 x n 2 3 in 2 this assessment was strengthened for all n 2 and x 0 the inequality x 2 ctg x 2 x 2 n k 1 sin kx k to determine the best approximation of the functions of trigon metric polynomas we needed to clarify the negligence of the fire json at the ends of the interval 0 theorem 1 for any natural n the inequality is n k 1 sin kx k sinnx at 0 x 2 n theorem 2 for any natural n the inequality is n k 1 sinkx k n n 1 sin 2 x 2 ctg x 2 x 2 2 n x note 1 outside of the 1 2 intervals given in theorems the sum of the row varies near the straight line y x 2 note 2 to determine the coefficients of the inequality and behavior of the series the matlab 7 2 package was used set up on the cluster of the center of computer technology of the matical department of the bashgu the work was carried out with the support of the rffi project 06 01 00354 182 l and t r a t r a 1 polya g sege g tasks and theorems from analysis t 2 m gostechizdat 1956 2 alzer horst koumandos stamatis inequalites of fejer jackson type monatsh math 2003 v 139 no 2 p 89 103 on the calculation of the claws of algebr lee d v reshetnikov nizhny novgorod university named after n i lobachevsky genserg hotmail com the second group of claws of classic algebrons lee with the eprictions in the attached module in the characteristic p 2 was found for algebrus with a homogeneous system of cor chebochko 2 the calculation of the second group of whom the monitoring for the rest of the classic algebrus lee is a great difficulty a software complex was developed for calculating the hn l m of an arbitrary final algebra lee l with the coefficients in the final module m for the case of the specified structural constants l and m in addition the graduated algebra l and the graduated module of the module m provides for the possibility of simplifying the calculations due to the graduation on claws the results of a numerical experiment for claws of the class of the syatic algebris of the cn series n 6 8 showed that the dimension of the crumology group h 2 l is 2 n 2 5 n 1 where n is the rank of algebra l and the basic cockers deliver the following weights in designations 1 1 for 0 we have dimh 2 l l n 1 183
