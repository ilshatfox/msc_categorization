infinite sets of vortex sources sinks that are identical in each homogeneous phase is considered a necessary and sufficient condition for the solvability of the problem is obtained which relates the power of sources sinks and the intensity of vortices in dissimilar phases using the obtained solution the flow networks streamlines and equipotentials for a number of sets of conductivities of different phases and fixed powers of the sources sinks and intensities of the vortexes was reconstructed the limiting cases of the degeneracy of a three phase medium into two phase and homogeneous are considered keywords doubly periodic heterogeneous structure complex analysis piece wise meromorphic solution conformal mapping 517 51 lp 0 p 1 1 nvomelchenko mail ru lp 0 p 1 yn f p inf g j t j n j p j 1 d f d j 1 g j p n n 1 nd nd 0 t j n p n n 0 lp n x j x j x 1 x j 1 x j 1 xd 0 2 d 1 j 1 d lp 1 p 0 p 1 2 3 4 4 g g 2 g g g g z 261 l 1 g 0 0 g d d j 1 j j 1 d rd j g j 1 d g d h f x zd f x h f p sup 0 h j j j 1 d h f x p h rd 0 1 f x x x 1 xd lp 0 p 2 d p 0 p 1 p c 2 1 rd rd 0 r d z d nd nd 0 d x y x 1 y 1 xd yd x y x 1 y 1 xd yd k j n x j j 1 d 1 d j 1 1 ei j k j 1 d 1 4 1 p 0 p 1 h 0 r r 0 t t t 0 r r v w 0 q r v q w f v w lq r v q w v q w w q v 2 c d a b 0 a b 1 a 0 b
