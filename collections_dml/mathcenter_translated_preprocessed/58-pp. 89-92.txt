sequentual first crossing look ahead procedure for selecting a population with the largest mean in normal normal model i a kareev a problem of statistical selecting of population with the largest mean value is considered we introduce a sequential selection procedure which we call first crossing look ahead for normal normal bayesian setting of the problem where variances of the populations are supposed to be the same and known and the means are realizations of prior normal random variable with known distribution parameters the paper includes the definition of the procedure with some basic analytical results keywords selection problem bayesian approach sequential procedure first crossing look ahead normal normal model 517 547 1 2 3 1 ikayumov gmail com 2 dianalynx rambler ru 3 samy iitm ac in 1914 1 d z c z 1 f z n 0 an z n b f z k 0 ak r k f for z r 13 90 2019 13 2 3 4 b d z c z 1 f z n 0 an z n f z 1 sn z 1 z 12 sn z n 1 k 0 ak z k f 12 5 6 7 b f z r f n z f z k n ak r k z r sn z f z k n ak z k r fn z r fn z c f z 8 9 f z n 0 an zn c f z k 0 1 k 1 k n 0 an zk 1 0 f t z 1 t z d t c f r n 0 1 n 1 n k 0 ak r n k 0 ak k r k r s k r s s 1 1 r r 0 xk 1 x d x 1 c f z 1 r log 1 1 r r z 0 1 91 1 f z k 0 ak z k d f z 1 d n r 1 c f z k n ak k r 1 r log 1 1 r r pn z r pn n r 0 n r 1 r log 1 r 2 r n 1 2 n r 1 r n r pn c f z 2 2 f z k 0 ak z k d f z 1 d n r 1 c f z 2 k n ak k r 1 r 2 log 2 1 1 r r p n z r p n n r 0 n r 1 r 2 log 1 r log 1 1 r r n 1 r n n r p n 1 c f z c f zm 3 f z k 0 ak z k d f z 1 d n r 1 m n n c f zm k n ak k r 1 r m
