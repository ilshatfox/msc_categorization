extracting terms in digital mathematical collections r r batyrshina 1 1 r batyrshina mail ru kazan volga federal university institute of mathematics and mechanics n i lobachevsky in the work considers existing methods for extracting terms the algorithm of their extraction is presented based on the method of using mathematical thesauruses the method is implemented in java key words clustering extraction of terms thesaurus the extraction of terms from scientific documents plays an important role in replenishment and in the development of various terminological resources primarily mathematical thesis and ontologies 1 2 the replenishment of such resources manually is quite a laborious task to facilitate this process it is necessary to automate the process of extracting terms 2 r r batyrshina 25 methods of extracting the terms existing core of this time in 3 are divided into three groups the first group thematic models based on the methods of clustering texts clastorization is a grouping of the document of the similar document collection on the basis of some measure of similarity as noted in 4 the task of clustering is that all similar documents are placed in one cluster and not similar documents are guaranteed to fall into different clusters in 3 the following methods of constructing thematic models are proposed an algorithm of k medium and spherically k medium hierarchical agglomerative clustering non negative matrix factorization second group probabilistic thematic models presenting each document in the form of a mixture under which each subject is a certain probabilistic distribution above the words the following representatives of this category are considered in 3 the method of probabilistic latent semantic indexing latent placement of airship the third group the basic thematic model in which the subtans are not distinguished and each document is considered as a separate subtem having examined the methods described above we have developed our own algorithm for extracting terms based on the method of using a dictionary our task was to create a program that could return the findings found in the text and together the dictionary according to which the search is carried out the program is implemented in the java language is able to perform the following actions accept the name of the file file format txt pdf format and return its contents in the form of a line follow the search for terms in the text using the mathematical dictionary we created the method is based on the method of using the dictionary that is it is necessary to make a test whether the word from the text to the dictionary is included in order to determine whether the word from the text and the term correspond to each other it is necessary to calculate the percentage correspondence initially the percentage correspondence for the word is calculated how much percent the prefix in the word occupies then the percentage correspondence for the term is also calculated if both the word and the term prefix occupies 60 percent the words correspond to each other and since the word from the text coincided with the term then returns
