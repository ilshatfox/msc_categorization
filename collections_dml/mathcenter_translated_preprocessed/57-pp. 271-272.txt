extreme rotation surfaces for the potential energy functional n m poluboyarova i a romanova we study the extremals of the potential energy functional such extremals model the state of equilibrium liquids in a gravitational field with a potential magnetic fluids and capillary surfaces imposing conditions on the functional we managed to constructles of extremal surface of revolution keywords the variation of functional extreme surface functional type area volumetric density functional the functional of potential energy the mean curvature of the exte sume sume sume sume sume sume sume sume sume simply udc 517 54 travel to bor inequality yesterday today and tomorrow s ponnus 1 1 samy iitm ac in the indian technological institute of marasa lecture is based on my recent active cooperation with ilgiz kayumov and therefore the results that will be considered are based on our joint work the results regarding the inequalities of the type of boron relate to the following two main families of functions namely 1 family of all limited analytical in a single circle of functions 2 family preserving the orientation of harmonic display of a single circle and the rest are obtained by generalizing or improving the inequality of boron this report will be given a review of a number of results including the latest achievement with regard to the classical inequality of bor in particular solutions to a number of problems about the radius of bor for various spaces of analytical function will be described we will also discuss several unpublished results and formulate some new problems keywords boron inequality limited analytical functions journey to bohr s inequality yesterday today and tomorrow s ponnusamy the lecture is based on my recent active cooperation with ilgiz kayumov and thus the results that 272 will be addressed will mainly be my joint work with lgiz kayumov and his team results concerning bohr type inequality are motivated by the following two fundamental family of functions namely 1 the family of all bounded analytic functions in the unit disk 2 the family of sense preserving harmonic mappings of the unit disk and the rest are evolved these by way of generalizing as bohr s phenomenon or improving the bohr inquality in different setting in this talk an overview on the number of results including recent trend on the classical inequality of bohr will be addressed in particular we indicate solutions to a number of problems on the bohr radius for different spaces of analytic functions a sequence of events led to new problems will be discussed we shall address few unpublined results and discuss some new problems keywords bohr s inquality bounded analytic functions udc 514 635 4 modeling the wave course of liquid films with thermal mass renewal l a prokudin 1 d a bukharev 2 1 prokudina susu ru south ural state university 2 needleinspace gmail com the south ural state university is represented by a nonlinear differential equation in private derivatives for the deviation of a free surface of a liquid film from a uninhabited state in the processes of heat and mass exchange computational experiments were carried out on the calculation of the wave characteristics of the liquid film frequency incremental phase speed in the processes of evaporation and condensation as well as computer modeling of the state of the free surface of the vertical film of water taking into account gradients superficial viscosity key words liquid film wave characteristics free surface temperature gradients subtle layers of viscous fluid liquid films moving along a solid surface under the influence of gravity for moderate reinolds with heat exchange evaporation condensation were investigated the acutality and practical significance of studying the currents of the thin layers of viscous fluid is associated with their wide implementation in numerous heat mass combat devices of thermal chemical metallurgical food pharmaceutical industries film rectifiers columns with flat parallel nozzles absorbers and others a combination of slight thickness films and a large surface of the contact can significantly intensify chemical thermal diffusion processes 1 2 the nonlinear differential equation in private derivatives is presented 3 for the deviation x t of the free surface of the liquid film from the calm
