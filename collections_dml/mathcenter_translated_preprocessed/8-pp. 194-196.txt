the multiple incompleteness of the own functions of the beams of ordinary differential operators will be considered in the space of l 2 0 1 a beam of operators l generated by differential expression l y y n p 1 y n 1 x npny x 194 and two point marginal conditions s k n 1 s jsky k 0 jsky k 1 0 j 1 n where pj jsk jsk c let the roots j j 1 n characteristic equation n p 1 n 1 pn 0 are different different from zero and lie on one ray emanating from the beginning of the coordinates without violating the community we can assume that 0 1 n let their own values s z board l are simple and form a counting set we denote through the many non lwells of s z let in addition the function y x a 1 e 1 x a 2 e 2 x ane nx aj c 1 is a beam l that is generating for its own functions corresponding to s z of the set consider the systems of functions y y x yc y x c earlier the author established that the yc system is not a n compliant in any space l 2 0 where 0 and has an infinite defect in the case of 1 the function y x is considered continued for the segment 0 1 by the formula 1 hence in particular a similar statement follows for the y it turns out that with some ratios between the parameters of the beam l there is a stronger result theorem if a 1 1 a 2 2 an 1 n 1 an n 2 then the yc system is not 2 fold in any space l 2 0 with 0 and has an infinite defect consequence if the condition 2 is fulfilled then whatever the set the y system is 2 fold full of 195 in any space l 2 0 with 0 and has an endless defect the work was supported by the russian federation project 00 01 00075 and the program leading scientific schools project 00 15 96123 t n saburova moscow about the absolute convergence of the ranks of the fourier coefficients according to bases such as faber shauder is well known that the faber shauder system uction bfsh is the basis in c 0 1 it is generated by one function 2 if m 2 k l then onic onic 2 kx l 1 while it is assumed that ory x is zero outside of the segment 0 1 following the same algorithm you can build gm x systems generated by the function g x and if g x satisfies certain conditions see for example 1 then this system also forms the basis in with 0 1 btfshg a basis of the faber shauder type generated by g x we denote the ag class of continuous functions in which a number of fourier coefficients in btfshg are absolutely converged theorem if for the factors fourier according to btfshg functions t x the rating is fair am t g c 22 k m 2 k l l 1 2 k m 2 1 and c 2 1 1 then ag at note 1 this condition is only sufficient but not necessary so the function t 1 x 4 x 1 x generates the shaidukov base in c 0 1 bs and at 1 aware however theorem 1 for the factors of fourier according to the bfsh function t 1 x are not performed note 2 take as the initial basis of the bfsh while a consequence of theorem 1 will receive if g x c 0 1 and max g 8 then ag a accord note 3 take it as the initial basis of the bs tog 196
