the reverse task of the reflection and refraction of elastic waves in the layered environment of i l alexandrov kazan state university considers a two layer elastic environment for each layer of which density elasticity and coefficients of poisson are set on the border of the section of the first and second layers a longitudinal elastic wave with a given amplitude falls as a result of this longitudinal and pepper waves that go to infinity appear in the first layer the reverse task boils down to restoring the thickness of the second layer according to a well known wave field in the first layer with well known elastic parameters of the environment seismic exploration equipment allows you to measure the deviations of the soil layer from the rest of the rest when a wave of a certain type passes by virtue of the principle of superposition of elastic waves the task is considered to be the spread of only on the ground waves on the border of the first and second layers at the production of the dots we place the seismic receivers which the way to measure the movements of y xi t i 1 n in normal at time t the thickness of the layer h is searched from the condition n i 1 m j 1 y xi tj u y xi h tj 2 0 1 where the movements u y xi h tj on the border are folded from the straps for a falling wave field and resulting from a reflected wave field problem 1 is solved by gradient descent this task has several solutions knowing the structure of the earth s 15 crust and the rate of spread of longitudinal waves in its different layers additional restrictions can be applied to the thickness of the layer in calculations as the first layer it was taken from black sea as a second layer marble only one decision turned out that satisfies these restrictions l and t r a t r a 1 grinchenko v t meleshko v v harmonic vibrations and waves in elastic bodies kyiv sciences dumka 1981 284 p 2 pleshchinsky n b reflection refraction and diffraction of two dimensional elastic waves the method of the redundant task of the koshi preprint pmf 04 01 kazan kazan matte sto vo 2004 34 p 3 alexandrova i l the direct task of the reflection and the pretense of elastic waves in the layered environment tr matte center named after n i lobachevsky t 32 mathematical modeling and mathematical physics kazan publishing house kazan matte about va 2005 s 50 59 gelfand formula levitan for the differential operators of the 2 nd order with the non cranky potential of e f akhmerov bashkir state university ufa in l 2 0 consider the operator h h 0 v where h 0 d 2 dx 2 v is the multiplication operator by the material function v x l 2 0 in the future the operator h is generated by one of the following conditions a u 0 u 0 b u 0 u 0 c u 0 u 0 16
