extraphlation properties of interporation scales k v lykov the paper describes the relationship between interporation and extraphlation constructs for some class of interpolation space obtained by the real interporation method an extraphlation description is pressented it is shown that for such spaces it is possible to replace thek functional in the interpolation description by a parametrized family of norms of exact interpolation spaces with characteristic functions t 0 1 in particular by the family of norms of peetre s spaces keywords interpolation spaces interporation functor extraphlation spaces peetre s spaces the real interporation method udc 517 53 517 947 942 on the analogue of the euler equation for extreme display with ki s or ko s medium characteristic a n malyutina 1 k a alipova 2 1 nmd math tsu ru national research tomsk state university 2 aka math tsu ru the national research state university of in real work continues the study of the differential and extreme properties of non meomorphic display with ki s ko s an means of means of an means in the theory of flat quasiconic displays to solve extreme problems a variation method is developed and successfully used 2 3 9 we offer an attempt to apply this classic method for solving extreme problems in the class of display with an medium characteristic keywords display with an medium characteristic differential properties variation extreme display let f d rn display of class w 1 n loc d then almost everywhere in the dio the values are the size f x n i j 1 fi x j 2 12 j x f det fi x j x and if j x f 0 is honored everywhere then the local characteristics of hi x f j x f l n x f ho x f ln x f j x f were determined consider the two limited areas d and d in the euclidean space rn for which there is a display f d d f x f 1 x f 2 x fn x from the covered continuous satisfying the conditions of fi x w 1 n loc d i e x d exists an u oxation of a point x d such that f j u w 1 n u f 1 i j x w 1 n loc d display f is called the display with ki s d d an average characteristic with ko s d d averaged characteristic if ki s x f 1 d d j x f l n x f s d x 1 s ki s f 1 242 materials of the international school conference k i s x f 1 d d j x f l n x f s j x f d x 1 s k i s f ko s x f 1 d d ln x f j x f s d x 1 s ko s f 2 k o s x f 1 d d ln x f j x f s x f d x 1 s k o s f here s 1 d the n dimensional measure of the lebeg region d denote through ki s d d and k i s d d a set of display f d d such as ki s f and respectively k i s f is finite ko s f and accordingly k o s f is finite the differentiation of such display is proved in 1 display f d d is called extreme in a certain class k of ki s or from k i s if f k and ki s f ki s g or k i s f k i s g for all g k functionals 1 2 are an integral characteristic of the display with the s medium characteristic these functionality are invariant relative to mebius transformations lemma 1 for any f ki s d d k i s d d the class of permissible variations is not empty for quasiconic displays this statement has been proved in 4 lemma 2 let f d d extreme display with s middle characteristic then for him the identity is d n i j ai j s x f x j d x 0 d n i j ai j ko s x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x f x j d x 0 d n i j ai j ki s x f x j d x 0 for any function x x where y is a smooth material function with a carrier in d lemma 3 let f d d extreme display with s middle terilicism then for him the identity is d n i j ai j k i s x f x j d x 0 i 1 2 n where x f x smooth material function with the carrier in d a n malyutin k a alipova 243 lemma 4 let f d rn continuous display with c medium characteristic of class c 1 d and j x 0 f 0 at some point x 0 d then there is a ball b x 0 such that h h with the corresponding choice 5 lemma 2 12 t 0 t 1 display ft x h p f x t x hep f x where ep is the p a single coordinate vector in rn is defined and is homeomorphism in b x 0 for any p 1 2 n theorem 1 let s 2 n 2 and display f d d is an extreme displacement in the class ki s d d then f w 22 d for any sizes d such that j x f 0 on the closure d and d
