einstein metrics with two functional parameters consider the four dimensional rimanov metric of the type g dt 2 a 21 e 1 2 a 22 t e 2 2 e 3 2 where 1 form of the ei form the algebra basis su 2 as you know e g malkovich 93 eight einstein ricij gij is a nonlinear differential equation of the second order on the ai t function it is known that with a suitable choice of coordinates systems a number of classic einstein meters metrics of fubini stupid taub no eguchi khanson are appreciated by the system of equations a 1 k 1 a 2 2 k 2 a 2 k 3 a 2 l 1 a 1 a 2 2 l 2 a 2 l 3 for suitable constants ki and lj the considered system the same way can be considered as one of the ways to get the degree of einstein s equation it was shown that in addition to the already known einstein metrics there is another ricci flat metric that satisfies this system 4 c 2 2 4 d 2 1 2 e 1 2 2 c 2 2 2 e 2 2 e 2 2 e 3 2 this metric is incomplete at the singular moment of the time of the t 0 the second function a 2 t behaves as t t 0 1 3 9 5 t t 0 for some constant and the first a 1 t explodes explodes like 2 3 t t 0 1 3 with t the function a 1 t strives for the constant and the function a 2 t becomes equivalent to linear function 2 t
