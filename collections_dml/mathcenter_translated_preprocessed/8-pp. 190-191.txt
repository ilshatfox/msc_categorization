the non metro stationary marginal task of the type of neumann for meta analytical functions is the final single link area on the plane of the computer alks variable z x iy limited by a simple smooth closed contour l through t denote the addition of t l to a complete comprehensive plane everywhere in the future we will use the designations and terminology adopted in 1 the following regional task is considered it is required to find all the meta analytical functions of the f z class m 2 t h 2 l which satisfy on the lredit condition f t n g t f t g t 1 where n is a derivative of the internal normal and g t g t specified on l functions h l with g t 0 the task 1 is the task of the neumann in the class of meta analytical functions therefore with g t 6 0 t l the formulated task will be called a modified task of the type of neuman for meta analytical functions moreover if g t 0 the task 1 is called homogeneous the task of the neumann i e the task 1 for g t 0 in the class of meta analytical functions is not neter since meta analytical in the circle t z z 1 the functions f z zn 1 z zn exp 0 z where n is an arbitrary natural number and 0 any complex number are solutions to a homogeneous problem of neumann 190 1 consequently the number of a linearly independent solutions to the homogeneous problem of neumann is not final which means that the task of neumann for the meta analytical functions of not neter however as will be established in this message a modified task of the type of neuman for meta analytical functions is neter l and t r a 1 rasulov k m m the sore tasks for polyanalytic functions and some of their applications smolensk sspu 1998 343 p i k rakhimov kazan methods of solving the singular integral equations on the material axis explores the exact and close methods of solving the nonlinear syngular integral equation aung a t t 1 mber h 1 t ory t d t 1 f t onic t 2 t onic t 1 mm h 2 t onic d t y t 1 where j r function onic t desired a t y t f t u hj t u t u v the known functions of their arguments at raction t mm and et v mm here the singular integralls are shj pul s hj pul t 1 mm hj t d t are understood in the sense of the main value of the cat leobe 191
