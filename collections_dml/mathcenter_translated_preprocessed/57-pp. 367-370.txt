the best approximation of uniform almost periodic functions of yu kh khasanov 1 1 yukhas 60 mail ru the russian tajik slavic university studies the question of the approach of almost periodic functions with whole functions of the final degree with an arbitrary spectrum in a uniform metric the necessary and sufficient conditions for belonging to uniformly periodic functions to the class of entire functions are also established key words almost periodic functions rows of fourier a spectrum of function whole functions of the final degree trigonometric polynomas the best uniform approximation determination of the continuous function on the entire material axis f x is called uniformly periodic if for each 0 you can specify such a positive number l l which in each interval of length l is at least one number for which inequality is executed f x f x least x mm the space of uniform almost periodic functions we denote it through b there is a closure of many trigonometric polynomas t x n k 1 ak exp i kx where ak fourier coefficients k are fourier spectrum of functions f x b with the norm f x b sup ip x mm f x consider the class of functions f x b with an arbitrary spectrum k i e functions that have a number of fourier species f x k mm ak exp i kx where ak lim t t t t f x exp iord dx it is known 1 that for the class of functions f x b the value of ak can differ from zero no more than on the counting set of spectrum values it is this circumstance that makes it possible to spread the concept of a number of fourier to the area of almost periodic functions through g 0 we denote a class of limited over the entire axis of entire functions of the degree not higher than consider the following important issue let 368 materials of the school conference give the function f x b what are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the belonging of this function to the classroom to resolve this issue we will prove the approval which is previously given by the author in 2 and is used to obtain the main results of this work theorem 1 in order for the uniform almost periodic function f x to belong to the classg it is necessary and sufficient for its indicatorsfuria k to satisfy inequality k s n bernstein 3 found that among the functions from class g carrying out the best uniform approximation of the 2 periodic function f x on the entire actual axis there is a trigonometric of polina no higher than the proof is based on the fact that if g f x g and sup mm x mm f x g f x a f 1 where a f is the best uniform approximation of order periodic period 2 functions through the functions of class g then evenly in all x least x mm the following estimates occur f x 1 2 n 1 n k n g x 2 k a f 2 lim n 1 2 n 1 n k n g x 2 k 2 g x 2 k 0 3 note that the above the result of s n bernstein can also be obtained if instead of 2 and 3 use the ratio n x q n n x a f where 0 n n any natural numbers n x 1 f x t fn t d t 1 2 n 2 n 2 n f x t fn t d t q n n x 1 2 n 2 n 2 n f x t fn t d t fn t sin 2 n 1 t 2 2 n 1 sin 2 t 2 and with any fixed n evenly in x least lim n nder q n n x 2 q n n x 0 for the first time an analogue of the theorem s n bernstein for functions f x b is found in the works of e a bredikhina 4 5 using the method of proof of s n bernstein she found that if the function f x b and has a number of fourier f x k ak exp i k x yu kh khasanov 369 has fourier indicators with a maximum point at infinity see for example 6 then among the functions of g x gl 0 for which there is an equality 1 there is a trigonometric of polynoma degree not above we formulate the main result of this note which is also an analogue of s n bernstein for uniform almost periodic functions with arbitrary fourier indicators k k 0 1 2 theorem 2 let f x b and a f sup mm x mm f x g f x 0 then for any 0 there is the final trigonometric sum piot x n k 1 bk exp i k x k for which the assessment is evenly valuable f x p x a f s n bernstein see 3 p 371 373 proved that for evenly continuity of the limited function f x throughout the material axis it is necessary and sufficient to make the inequality of a f c f 1 4 where c is a certain absolute constant and f sup x 1 x 2 f x 1 f x 2 the ratio 4 was obtained by the maximum transition at n from the inequality of a f en f n where en f is the best approximation of the function f x by segment polynomas of degree n further for uniform almost periodic functions we will try to find the function g x
