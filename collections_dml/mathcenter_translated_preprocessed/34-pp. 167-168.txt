the presentation of the space of whole functions by the pairs of fisher v v napalkov a a nuyatov institute of mathematics with the cu u council of ministers of the russian academy of sciences shaig anrb ru nizhny novgorod state university named after n i lobachevsky root mm un ru let pn z and qm z polynomials of degrees n and m through ip z we denote the ideal in the algebra of all the whole functions h c generated by the polynomial p z let the wq the space of all solutions of the differential equation q d dz y 0 consider many functions of the type ip wq it is known that if n m and qn z pn z then h c ip wq symbol means direct amount the question naturally arises what is the amount of ip wq in the case when the degree of m n or m n consider the case when the degree of polynoma q z is more than the degree of polynoma p z that is degq degp the polynomial q z will always imagine in the form of a work of two polynomials of the lesser degree q z q 1 q 2 z moreover degq 1 169 degp then the space h c can be represented as a direct amount h c ip wq 1 since wq consists of linear combinations of the exhibit then wq wq 1 wq 2 and therefore wq 1 wq let z wq this means that wor z h z g z h z ip g z wq 1 then wor z g z h z where it follows that h z wq 2 but h z ip therefore ip wq 6 that is the space of integers representable in the form of h c ip wq but not represented in the form of a direct amount let us now consider the case when the degree of polynoma p z is more than the degree of polynoma q z i e degp degq we always imagine the polynomial p z as a work of two polynomials of the lesser extent p z p 1 p 2 z moreover degp 1 degq then the space h c can be represented as a direct amount h c ip 1 wq let f z ip then f z h z g z h z ip 1 g z wq since ip ip 1 then f z h z which is incorrect therefore in the case of degp degq the sum ip wq does not coincide with h c l and t r a t r a 1 shapiro h s an algebraic theorem of e fischer and the holomorphic goursat problem bull london math soc 1989 no 21 p 513 537 170
