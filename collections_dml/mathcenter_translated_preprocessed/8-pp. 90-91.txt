point transformations and equations of penlevy is well known that the next class of differential equations of the second order y p x y 3 q x y y 3 r x y y 2 s 2 s x y y 3 1 is closed relatively unpertured point transformations this made it possible to build an effective classification of equations 1 in the work of 1 regarding the data of the breaks of blows all six equations of penlev the coefficients of which are measorphic functions belong to class 1 therefore methods from 1 are applicable for their study the main results a a classification of penilee equations relative to unbearable point transformations b a necessary condition for equivalence of equation 1 of the penlevse equation was found c for the equations of penilev iii and penlev iv piii y 1 y y 2 1 x y 1 x ay 2 b cy 3 d y piv y 1 2 y y 2 3 2 y 3 4 xy 2 2 x 2 a y b y built a special necessary condition for the equivalence of the equations of type 1 d dan 2 an effective criterion for reducing the equations of the form 1 to the equations of penlevy i and penlev ii pi y 6 y 2 x pii y 2 y 3 xy a the work was supported by the russian federation project 01 01 00996 a listed 1 sharipov r a effective procedure of point classification for the equations y p 3 qy 3 r y sum s y 3 eleectronic archive at lanl 1998 math g 9802027 p 1 35 2 dmitrieva v v effective test of equivalence the second order ordery differential exidents to painleve i and painleve ii equations electron g studied in russia www zhurnal ape relarn ru articles 2000 095 pdf 2000 no 095 c 1298 1317 e p dolzko moscow the worst fractions 91
