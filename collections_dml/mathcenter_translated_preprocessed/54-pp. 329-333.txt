riemann s vector margin on the riman surface of e v semenko 1 t i semenko 2 1 semenko 54 gmail com novosibirsk state technical university novosibirsk state pedagogical university 2 semenko ti mail ru the novosibirsk state technical university the novosibirsk state pedagogical university in the article discusses the previously practically non considered vector regional task of linear conjugation the vector task of riman on the riman surface it is shown that any vector edge of riemann on the riemann surface can be reduced to the consistent solution of well studied riemann one dimensional tasks key words rimanova surface vector marginal task of linear conjugation on the compact riman surface d genus 0 consider the vector edge of the riemann the task of linear conjugation f t g t f t g t t l 1 where l where l d is a smooth outline on d not necessarily coherent dividing d into two liaison parts d and the orientation l is agreed with d f t corresponding boundary values on l analytical in d n dimensional vector f z g t unpertured detg t 0 gelderov n n matrix on l called the matrix of the coefficients of the regional condition g t helderova n dimensional vector function on l right side this task is exhaustively studied on a plane i e in the riman sphere 0 see for example 1 and in one dimensional n 1 case it was well studied on a riman surface of any kind see for example 2 3 however vector marginal tasks on the riman surface of the genus 0 were practically not studied we will consider both analytical and measuring solutions to the problem 1 recall see for example 1 that the vector f z f 1 z fn z t is called analytical measorphic in d if its coordinates f j z j 1 n analytical merorphic in d at the same time point z 0 is called the pole of the vector f z if it is a pole of at least one coordinate and the pole of the pole will be the maximum pole order for all coordinates similarly the point z 0 will be zero of the vector if all its coordinates turn at this point at zero and the order of zero is the minimum order of zero according to the coordinates in the usual way the vector division and the frequency of the vector are determined in a given division as usual in the task of riemann let s call the g 1 t and g 2 t coefficients with equivalent if g 2 t x t g 1 t x t 1 where x t the boundary values of the matrix x z unpertured det x z 0 and analytical in d solutions of the problems of the conjugation f j t g j t f j t g j t j 1 2 g 1 t x t g 2 t 330 materials of the international school conference are obviously connected by the ratio f 2 z x z f 1 z in particular the analytical solutions of problems have the same zeros and the middle zeros and poles and poles have the same zeros thus a significant stage in solving the problem 1 is the classification of matrices g t with accuracy to equivalence so then we will consider only homogeneous g t 0 mating tasks similarly to the tasks on the plane to solve problems on the riman surface the so called koshi koshi core p q is an abelev differential in p multiple r 1 r r 10 q 1 with deductions unit in q and minus unit in r 0 and the middle function according to q the multiple p 1 r 0 r 11 r 1 here 0 r 1 r r 10 is the minimum dividezer i e there are no abel differentials multiple and middle functions multiple 1 the core of koshi k 0 p q is a direct analogue of the expression d p p q on the plane its construction and properties see for example in 2 in particular with the help of a koshi nucleus for any point q l you can build analytical in d functions z q z having the only simple zero at the point z q 2 let further q t q t q t t l for the divisor arn ur ps q 1 1 qm 1 1 put z s j 1 p j z m j 1 q j z 1 t s j 1 p j t m j 1 q j t 1 it is obvious that the vector f z is the solution of a homogeneous problem f t g t f t multiple of the divizer then and only when f 0 z f z z there is an analytical solution to the problem f 0 t g 0 t f 0 t g 0 t g t t with the help of the specified core of the koshi and the introduced functions z you can completely repeating and only slightly modifying the reasoning for tasks on the plane 1 prove the following statements 1 the homogeneous regional task f t g t f t in the class of functions multiple of the divizer is reduced to the system of integral equations of fredgolm on l hereinafter the fredgolm system in turn the system of equations associated with the fredgolm system i e setting the conditions for the resolution of the fredgolm system is reduced to a homogeneous regional task in the class of functions multiple of the divizer 1 the so called union task 2 the order of the division of any middle solving a homogeneous problem does not exceed the constants m m g i e in particular if deg
