the decomposition of the semi resistant algebra of the associative type in the works 1 2 was introduced into consideration of the lievsky type algebra class let us give its definition let g a switching group l g g sorted algebra above the field k i e l cho l t g t mm and l l l if t and l l 0 if 6 we will say that l is the lyevsky type algebra if for any t are such k 6 0 0 that if a l b l c l then ab c a bc b ac if 0 for any t then the algebra l will be called the algebra of the associative type just as for associative algebra an ultimately algebra of the associative type will be called semi resistant if it does not have inilpotent ideals and simple if it does not have non trivial bilateral ideals theorem the ended free semi industrial g gorduated algebra ac 55 of the social type above the field of zero characteristics with a completely ordered group g is a direct sum of simple ideals l and t r a t r a 1 bahturin y zaicev m identites of graded algebras j algebra 205 1998 no 1 p 1 12 2 bakhturin yu a zaitsev m v segal s k g g g the nasso algebr mat collection 1999 t 190 no 11 p 3 14 v d mazurov novosibirsk mazurov math nsc ru on the locally free action of endless groups be a group acting on the additively recorded abel group v they say that g acts freely on v if vg 6 v for 0 6 v v 1 6 g g the known tsassenhaus theorem gives the classification of the final groups that can act freely on the non trivial abele group in 1 this theorem was distributed from the final groups to groups in which any two conjugated elements of a simple order generate the final subgroup significant progress was achieved in 2 where it is proved that the periodic group generated by elements of about three and acting freely on the non trivial abel group is finite the work 3 shows that the condition for frequency in this result can be loosened to the condition of the limb of the order of the switch of any two conjugated elements of the order 3 finally in 4 the result of 2 mentioned above is generalized when the condition of freedom of action is applied only on subgroups generated by two conjugated elements of a simple order the next result significantly expands the class of the studied groups due to the weakening of the condition imposed on 2 sorrower subgroups teorema 1 let g a group acting exactly on the abel group v suppose g is generated by such a class x of the conjugated elements of about 3 that any two elements x y from x are either double halved or generate a periodic subgroup acting freely on v then g is either a cyclic group of about 56
