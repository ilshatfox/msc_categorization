subdifferentials for the difference of convex functions e s polovinkin it is shown that for some classes of funculations all epiderivates and subdifferentials of f clarke p michel j p penot type and others coincide several rules of calculation of subdifferentials for the difference of two convex function are obtained some examples are considered keywords nonsmooth analysis convex function semiregular function directional derivatives subdifferentials udc 514 752 514 764 274 517 97 condition for the stability of extreme surfaces n m poluboyarova 1 1 natasha medvedeva volsu ru volgograd state university describes the result of the condition of the stability of an extreme surface since the extremes of the functional work in question are modeling for example physical equilibrium fluids in a gravitational field with potential tent coatings the task of determining their stability is very relevant key words variation of functionality extreme surface functionality of the type of area functionality of volumetric density of forces functionality of potential energy stability introduction in the work presents a study of the stability of extreme functionality of potential energy just as the minimum surfaces are extremely extremely functional of the area and the smooth surfaces we are considering extreme functionality which is a linear combination of the functionality of the type of area and functionality from the volumetric density of forces such extreme surfaces model the conditions of equilibrium fluids in the gravitational field with potential tent coatings magnetic fluids capillary surfaces therefore their study on stability and instability does not lose relevance and the functionality studied is complicated in order to contain more information about the physical characteristics of the system the areas of sustainability and instability of minimal surfaces were searched for in various methods both analytical for example using variations of 298 materials of the international school conference functionality of the area surfaces indices and using the geometric properties of surfaces for example using display and modularity technology there is a wide range of works devoted to the study of the stability of the minimum surfaces in the euclidean and pseudo euclidean spaces in particular the work of yu a aminov v a klyachin v m milikov a v pogorelov v g tkachev a a tuzhilina a t fomenko m to carmo c k penga sh yau r finn j simons and others in this work it is proposed to introduce a size similar to the main frequency when whose help the task of stability is to find a solution to differential inequality in 1 it is shown that in the surface of the surface there is a solution to the jacobi equation the setting of the problem let m a n dimensional oriented variety of class c 2 consider the oriented hyperpore m m u obtained with 2 load u m rn 1 let rn 1 some area such that m rn 1 r c 2 loud functions if the lection of the field of single norms to the surface m then for any c 2 clatter of the surface m the value w m m answers x d x 1 which does not depend on the choice of normal hole functionality 1 will call the functionality of potential energy the surface m is extreme if the first variation of the functionality 1 is zero for all endlessly small surface m the extreme surface m is stable if the second variation of the functionality 1 is familiar with all endlessly small surface m otherwise unstable denote g gi j n 1 i j 1 gi j 2 answers j i j dart 2 where dart unk 1 answers ern 1 i j a symbol of the crownker ki the main curvatures ei are the main directions of the surface theorem 1 ifw t w mt then w 0 m div dart t nh x h x dm where div divergence in the metric of the surface m h h the average curvature of the surface relative to the normal hole moreover ifw 0 0 for any function h x c 10 m then w 0 g h h h 2 x n i 1 k 2 i g ei ei dm 3 n m poloboyarova 299 where the quadratic form corresponding to the matrix 2 comment variations for the functionality of the type of area were obtained in 2 a sign of the stability of the extreme surface further we will believe that the matrix g of 2 is positively determined and 0 we introduce the value m inf m g h h dm m qh 2 dm where is q n i 1 k 2 i g ei ei and the exact lower line is taken according to all lipschit functions h m m r so that m h m dm 0 since 3 is made for any function h x c 10 m for definitely the style of the condition in the form of h x m 0 m h x dm 0 let and the minimum and maximum module of the matrix s own values 2 then the theorem 2 if there is a positivec 2 funct
