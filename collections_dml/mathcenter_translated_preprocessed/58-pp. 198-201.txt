lobachev readings 2019 udc 517 928 analysis of threshold phenomena in the model of the electrochemical reactor n m firstova 1 1 firstova natalia yandex ru samara national research university named after academician s p the queen in the work raises the question of comparing the values of the control parameter for the trajectory obtained for the dynamic system and the values in which the solution of the stochastic system under consideration becomes unstable that is more amplitude vibrations are observed in the system the dynamics of changing the values of the control parameter of the stochastic system was built when the noise intensity changes keywords trajectories stability system stability random disturbances in the work considered a modified two dimensional model of the electrochemical reaction of the coopera iliter 1 2 from the point of view of taking into account the influence of the fluctuations of the environment on the course of the chemical reaction since these fluctuations are random in nature their accounting in the framework of the alleged modification should lead to the fact that the new model will be considered stochastic naturally such indignation should be introduced through an additive additive into the parameters of the inpatient process suppose that the system contains white noise of low intensity du d t kae 2 u 1 kd e 2 1 u 1 p u d d t kae 2 u 1 kd e 2 kee 0 f e cil 2 q u 1 a variable u is a dimensionless concentration of a substance on the surface surface concentration is a dimensionless volumetric concentration of a substance domestic variable reflects the amount of substance adsorbed on the surface of the electrode e is the potential of the electrode is the adsorbate coefficient 0 is the symmetry coefficient for the transfer of electrons the current density is set in a dimensionless form by means of the equation j kee 0 f e f f rt where r is a universal gas constant f is a constant faradea t is the temperature hole and scalar standard independent vinerian processes the intensity of random interference since the parameter is small the system is a singularly indignant in the works 3 4 5 a detailed analysis of the deterministic model was carried out using methods of the theory of singular disturbances and numerical methods it was shown that the critical regime is modeled by the trajectory of the grid and that it is this regime that plays the role of a peculiar watership between the two main types of reaction flow modes a stable cycle and vibrations with self risk the trajectory is the ear and the value of the control parameter k e was n m firstova 199 are presented in the form of asymptotic decomposition according to the degrees of the small parameter u 0 kd e 2 0 e 0 f e kae 2 1 2 u 1 kau 0 1 e 2 kd e 2 1 u 0 1 e 0 f e u 0 kae 2 u 0 0 ka 1 e 2 kd e 2 ka 1 e 2 1 e 0 f e 3 1 kau 1 1 e 2 u 1 kau 1 u 1 1 e 2 e 0 e u 1 here is the value at the disruption point obtained from the equation of irregular points kau 1 2 e 2 kaue 2 cd e 2 kd e 2 kee 0 f e 0 4 equations 2 and 4 determine the points of the interpretation for the studied stochastic system we find a special point as well as the meaning of the control parameter k e in which a change in its type occurs to do this we write down the following system of equations kae 2 u 1 kd e 2 1 u 1 0 kae 2 u 1 kd e 2 step kee o f e 2 0 from which we obtain equations for finding u venting u 1 ke o f e 1 2 5 and equation determining value police kae 2 1 ke o f e 1 kd e 2 step kee o f e cil 2 0 6 the equation is transcendental and does not have a general solution the specific value of the venting parameter can be found in numerically for various sets of system parameters thus we obtain a special point a 1 ke o f e ls for the linarization of the system 1 we find our own values at this point to do this we will solve the following equation j 0 f u u f u g u u g u a 0 200 lobachev readings 2019 what can be written in the form of 2 w 1 w 2 0 with discriminant d w 21 4 w 2 7 where w 1 kae police 2 1 kae police 2 u venting 1 2 1 police kd e 2 1 yware 2 kee 0 f e 1 8 w 2 kae police 2 1 kee 0 f e kae 2 u police 1 venting kd e 2 1 2 kee 0 f e based on the analysis of the type of special points carried out in the work 3 4 5 we can conclude that the type of special point depends only on the sign w 1 that is the loss of stability occurs at w 1 0 we equalize the expression 8 to 0 and we find the value of the controller parameter k e in which the system loses stability k e kae 2 1 1 2 1 1 1 mit kd e fur 2 1 2 1 kae 2 step 1 2 1 1 e 0 f e 8 to study the effect of external noise on the behavior of the system the following values are recorded
