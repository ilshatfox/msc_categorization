the characterization of traces with suspended inequalities is denoted through the algebra of all the matrices of the nth order above the field c m n m h n the family of positive and hermite matrices respectively for a b mhn we write a 6 b if 43 b a m n in 2 a complete description of the class of all functions f is given for which the inequality of tr af a 6 tr af b 0 6 a 6 b a b mn is given if f is a degree function it is not difficult to prove that for any a b m n a 6 b there is tr a 2 r p 6 tr arbpar where r 0 p 1 the purpose of this work get new characterization of traces with the help of such balanced inequalities on algebra mn lemma 1 let is a positive linear functionality on m 2 the function f x is continuously differentiated and f x 0 on 0 urb let for matrices a 1 1 1 c 1 0 0 1 the inequality ises a df a df a tc dt t 0 0 then is a scalar multiple trace theorem 1 let positive linear functionality on mn function f x is continuously differentiated f x 0 on 0 urb and f 0 0 if for any a 6 b from m m from m n the inequality af a 6 onic af b then lus is a scalar multiple trace note 1 it turns out that if the function f is not constant on 0 and onic af b r or onic bf a r for any a 6 b of m n then ffic is followed lemma 2 let is a positive linear functionality on m 2 such that with r 0 and p 1 for any 44 a c m 2 the inequality ffic ar d a tc p dt is performed t 0 ar 0 then is a scalar multiple trace with the help of lemma 2 the following theorem is proved which is a generalization of some results from 1 and 3 theorem 2 let positive linear functionality on mn and at r 0 p 1 for any matrices a 6 b from m n the inequality ffic ap 2 r 6 arbpar is made then is a scalar multiple of the trace note 2 with p 0 1 ap 6 bp follows from a 6 b therefore with r 0 we have ap 2 r 6 arbpar then the inequality in theorem 2 is true for any positive linear functionality l and t r a t r a 1 bikchentaev a m tikhonov o e characterization of the trace by monotonicity inqualites linear algebra appl 2007 v 422 p 274 278 2 dinh trung hoa tikhonov o e weighted trace inequalites of monotonicity lobachevskii journal of math 2007 v 25 p 63 67 3 sano t yatsu t characterization of the tracial property via inqualites j inequal pure appl math 2006 v 7 issue 1 article 36 45
