the issues of uniqueness for a certain class of the haara rows we are considering some of the issues of uniqueness for the rows of haar n 1 anma x the next terminolo giya is used the set of a 0 1 is called the m mnity for the rows of haar with a certain condition a if there is a number of haaras with condition a not all coefficients of which are zero satisfying the condition a and converging to zero outside a if the set of a is not a m mnity for the rows of haar with condition a then many a will call the u many for the rows of haaras with condition a as a condition a consider the condition sn x o n 1 1 where sn x n n 1 anti x o its for each x and 0 1 let the non empty perfect subset of the segment 0 1 we introduce a number of numerical characteristics of the set b we build the function b determined on all binary intervals we conclude that b 0 if and only when there are no points from b let b 0 1 1 next we build the b function according to the rank of binary interval see 1 let the b be defined in the binary interval rank n determine the b on non exciting binary intervals i i 1 2 which constitute in the combination of engine namely even if k is the number of intervals i inside of which there are points from b then b i 1 k b if inside is points from b and b i 0 otherwise definition we call the index of point x b relative to the set b the number or possibly two numbers indb x sup 0 b n o n where n is the sequence of nuclear intervals inside each of which is points from b and the rank n is equal to n and x n at the same time two indices have those points x for which there are two similar sequences we call the upper in 182 dex of the set b the number b sup x and the lower in dex of the set b is the number indb inf x b indb x at the same time 0 indb indb 1 formulate the main results theorem 1 if a is the m mnity for the rows of haar with condition 1 then a contains the perfect subset b with indb then a is the m mnity for the rows of haar with condition 1 theorem 2 if a does not contain perfect subsets b with indb then a is the u many for the rows of haar with condition 1 in particular if a is a complete set with inda then a is a u many for the rows of haar with condition 1 theorem 3 for any 0 1 there is a perfect set b with indb and indb theorems 2 and 3 show that there are committed many for the rows of haar with condition 1 if 0 1 thereby theorem 2 of work is generalized 2 where the perfect umnity is built under a stronger condition namely namely namely namely namely subject to the limitations of the general member of the haar series in this case sn x o log 2 n the work was supported by the russian federation project 99 01 00355 l and t r a t r a 1 skvortsov v a the calculation of the coefficients everywhere converging a row of haara mat collection 1968 t 75 issue 3 s 349 360 2 mushegyan g m about many uniqueness for the haara system izv an arm ssr 2 1967 no 6 c 350 361 n i popov yoshkar ola 183
