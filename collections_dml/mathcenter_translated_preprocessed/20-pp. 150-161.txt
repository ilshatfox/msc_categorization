the numerically analytical method of solving the generalized problem of stox a v kargin moscow state university m v lomonosov moscow 1 introduction currently practical and theoretical interest is the study of the movement of a viscous inconspicuous fluid a number of such tasks are described by non stationary equations of navestox see 1 their sampling in time leads to the tasks of the following type see for example 2 find the vector function 151 numerically analytical method u u x y v x y and the function p x y that satisfy in the area a 2 6 x 6 a 2 b 2 6 y 6 b 2 with the border 1 2 where 1 x a 2 a 2 b 2 6 y 6 b not 2 2 y b 2 b 2 a 2 6 x 6 a 2 the system of equations and the boundary conditions 4 u u p f div u 0 u 0 where f f g 1 1 in this work a new solution is presented 1 1 in a continuous case the method is iteration and it was analyzed by the analysis of convergence depending on the external parameters of the task which is one of the most important characteristics of methods of this kind 2 the setting of the problem before starting solving the problem 1 1 we will impose some restrictions on many acceptable solutions let u v p l 2 and have derivatives to the second order inclusive from l 2 in addition we demand that f g l 2 in estimates we will use the norm 2 2 dpi let s move on to the description of the method under discussion we will look for a solution 1 1 in the form u p u 1 p 1 u 2 p 2 where u 1 p 1 solution to the problem 4 u 1 u 1 p 1 f div u 1 0 2 1 with boundary conditions u 1 1 0 v 1 x 1 0 u 1 y 2 0 v 1 2 0 152 a v kargin at the same time u 2 p 2 respectively the solution of the problem 4 u 2 u 2 p 2 0 div u 2 0 2 2 with boundary conditions u 2 1 0 v 2 1 v 1 1 u 2 2 u 1 2 v 2 2 0 3 the solution of the heterogeneous problem will look for a solution 2 1 by fourier of the separation of variables we have u m n umn sin m x a 2 a cos n y b 2 b v m n vmn cos m x a 2 a sin n y b tempo 2 b p m n pmn cos m x a 2 a cos n y b 2 b 3 1 where umn vmn pmn are constant which are determined from the system of equations m 2 a 2 n 2 b 2 umn mpmn a fmn m 2 a 2 n 2 b 2 vmn npmn b gmn mumn a nvmn b 0 3 2 here the numbers fmn gmn are determined from the decomposition f m n fmn sin m x a 2 a cos n y b 2 b g m n gmn cos m x a 2 a sin n y b not 2 b 153 numerically analytical method from 3 2 for umn vmn pmn are followed by the formulas pmn mfmn a ngmn b m 2 a 2 n 2 b 2 umn n 2 fmn b 2 mngmn m 2 a 2 n 2 b 2 m 2 a 2 n 2 b 2 vmn m 2 gmn a 2 nmfmn m 2 a 2 n 2 b 2 m 2 m 2 m 2 m 2 a 2 n 2 b 2 now the formulas 3 1 give us u 1 p 1 thus they found a heterogeneous part of the solution to the problem 1 1 4 the solution of a homogeneous problem all the tasks considered below differ from 2 2 only by boundary conditions therefore in order to save money we will record only the latter by virtue of the linearity of the problem 2 2 to solve it it is enough to obtain an effective method of solving the following problem u 1 0 v 1 0 u 2 u 1 2 v 2 0 4 1 to solve 4 1 consider the auxiliary problem u 1 0 v x 1 0 u y b 2 h 1 x u y b 2 h 2 x v 2 0 4 2 its solution is explicitly the calculations will be carried out later we will show how knowing how to decide 4 2 get a decision 4 1 consider the following iteration process step 1 we solve the problem u 1 0 v x 1 0 u 2 u 1 2 v 2 0 4 3 154 a v cargin let u 1 v 1 p 1 its decision step 2 solve the problem u 1 0 v 1 v 1 1 u y 2 0 v 2 0 4 4 let u 2 v 2 p 2 its decision step n n odd solve the problem u 1 0 v x 1 0 u 2 u n 1 2 v 2 0 4 5 let u n v n p n its decision etc now we note that the fulfillment of the conditions u n 2 2 6 v n 1 1 2 and v n 1 2 6 u n 1 2 2 4 6 with 1 allows us to argue that u v u 1 v 1 u 2 v 2 and p p 1 p 2 will be the desired decision 4 1 tasks 4 3 4 4 4 5 are the tasks of the species 4 2 as well as tasks 4 2 with a turn on 2 which is not fundamentally here and lower by u 2 2 is understood to mean u y b 2 2 u y b 2 2 accordingly it is understood and v 1 2 4 1 solution of the auxiliary problem solving an auxiliary problem 4 2 has the form u m um y sin m x a 2 a v m vm y cos m x a 2 a 155 numerically the analytical method p m pm y cos m x a 2 a where um vm pm are determined from the system of equations m 2 a 2 um u m mpm a 0 m 2 a 2 vm v m p s 0 mum a v m 0 4 7 and the following boundary conditions
