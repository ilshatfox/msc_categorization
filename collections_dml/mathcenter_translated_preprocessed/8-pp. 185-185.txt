the construction of a model wing profile with a purely circulation flow is proposed a simple method for constructing a model profile on which a purely circulation flow of an ideal inconsistent fluid is implemented as a comprehensive potential of the flow of such a profile the complex potential is used from a vortex resistant placed in a plane parallel stream w z q imb 2 ln z vift where q is the abundance of the source the circulation of the vortex and vimate the speed of the incurred stream at the same time part of one of the current lines of such a course is taken over the profile circuit as a result the contour of the profile which has the shape of a snail through the hole in which the flow is carried out on the basis of numerical calculations various forms of such profiles were found depending on the ratio of the vortex circulation and the abundance of the source an analysis of the nature of the course was also carried out depending on the location of the gap on the profile circuit the optimal value of the initial parameters was found in which the flow of the largest part of the circuit occurs without separation of the border layer the work was supported by the rfff projects 99 01 00365 99 01 04029 the program universities of russia and the rocr foundation of the academy of sciences v f pulyaev e yu savchitz krasnodar on the reversibility of integral 185
