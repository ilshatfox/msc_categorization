izerized logarithmic assessments of the speed of convergence of the methods of solving linear operator equations in the hyalbert space h is considered the operator equation au f where a l h h a a 0 a 0 m it is assumed that r a 6 r a f r a the class of methods of approximation of the closest to the chosen initial approximation h the solution u this equation u i a f 0 0 1 is investigated to obtain assessments of the speed of the method of method 1 the condition of the source of the initial inevitability is used u ln ln 1 what if u peace ln a pv p 0 and sup m 0 m 1 ln p c 0 ln p 0 0 3 m 0 1 then the assessment is u u c 1 ln 0 0 0 0 1 suppose that the generating function for some 0 0 0 1 satisfies the condition 1 c 2 1 ln 1 1 ln 1 1 ln 1 1 4 0 0 0 0 we go off the sequence mk m 1 1 mk emk 1 k 2 3 theorem let a m where m 0 m 11 n and the conditions 2 4 are fulfilled then the assessment u u c 3 ln ln ln p 0 is fair 0 0 0 0 m 1 n n characters ln the condition 4 is satisfied with the functions which generate the method of m m lavrentiev its iconic version method 135 of the establishment as well as obvious and implicit iteration procedures l and t r a t r a truring m yu yusupova n a on the criteria for slow convergence of methods for solving linear equations reverse and incorrectly set tasks thesis of dokl conc m moscow state university 2000 c 39 a p kolesnikov moscow basics in local convex spaces the calculation of topological bases in local convex spaces is associated with the clarification of the conditions of existence and constructing homomorphisms acting from a given lvp e into some separately separated lvp the basis in which exists the functional implementation of e as a vector space of continuous numerical functions is considered that is the linear functionality dirac function t x t x t x t e t k t t t t t t t t locally compact space k compact in t theorem let e and f separated by the lvp a e f linear continuous and therefore the slightly continuous display e in f a is its conjugated display which is the weak isomorphism of the space f in e let the many a f e total on e and t a f if e is completely full and f is sideways then a is the topological isomorphism of the spaces e and f a continuous operator reverse for the operator a can be built in this way since t a f e t k there is a weak solution gt a equation a gt t as a result of which equality is fair 136
