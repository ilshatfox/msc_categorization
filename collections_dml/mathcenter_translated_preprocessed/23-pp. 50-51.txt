the balance of strongly coherent graphs with scales in half groups let s half group g oriented graph each arc of whose weight is assigned the element of the semi group s the weight of the path in the column is naturally determined as a work of arches along this path the graph is called k balanced if the weight of any path of the length is no more than k in it is unambiguously determined by the length of the path and its initial and final peaks the graph is called balanced if it is k balanced at any k examples of balanced graphs are the graphs of the final groups the columns of the iconic portraits of indecent complex matrices satisfying the condition ak af at all k where a max i j aij famous matrix norm if for a certain natural k each k balanced strongly coherent n varic column with weights in the half group s is a balanced then the smallest of these ks are designated through sc n s theorem 1 each n 2 2 n 2 balanced strongly bonds of the 52 ve naval graph with weights in the half group s are balanced that is the inequality sc n s n 2 2 n 2 1 theorem 2 is fair assessment 1 is accurate for all values n and only when the semi group s satisfies at least one of the following conditions 1 the orders of its elements are not limited in aggregate 2 there is an underground t s containing more than one element and a monoid d i ivanov tyumen ivanow dmitry ru about some issues of poorly combinatorial and implicit selector sets below are a continuation of studies published in the works 1 and 2 in 1 the question remained open is it true that the class is weak x y z cks by the sets is strictly contained in the class of weakly xy xz yz cx sets a positive answer to this question is given in 2 it was asked whether it was true that the class is weak x y hens of sets is strictly contained in the class of weakly xyz xyz xy z xyz eis it turns out that the answer to this question is negative let m 1 i m 1 x 1 x 2 xi 1 xi 1 xm 1 and k m the class is weak m heating of the sets it is proved that k m k m 1 as well as that if is a monotonous boulevium a function that depends on no more than four variables then k x y k xy xz yz k u xy xz yz xyz k x and everywhere the inclusions are strict 53
