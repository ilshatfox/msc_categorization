the regional task of riemann for p analytical function on an indestructible spiral circuit 1 this work continues the 2 study of the regional task of riemann for the p analytical function on the spiral circuit formulation of the problem find p analytical function f z z the boundary values of which on the curve l satisfy the condition of the riemann f t g t f t g t t l 1 where p where p analytic function f z z u x y iv x y is such that u x 1 p v v u y 1 p v x p const im p 0 research each p analytic function f z z mutually unambiguously corresponds to the analytical function onic z and f z z p 1 onic z p 1 gment z 2 p 2 onic z p 1 f z z p 1 f z z 2 by substituting the value 2 b 1 we get p 1 onic t p 1 onic t g t p 1 ng t g t p 1 ng t 2 pg t 3 simultaneously with condition 3 the conjugated condition p 1 t p 1 onic t g p 1 ng t g t p 1 ng t 2 pg t 4 multiply equality 3 by p 1 equality 4 by p 1 we add the obtained ratios in the case of g t g t on l i e when g t is a real function we will come to the condition onic t g t ng t g 1 t 5 129 where g 1 t p 1 g t p 1 g t 2 thus the task 1 for p analytic function f z z is reduced to the regional task of riemann 5 for the analytical function z in 1 2 the task 1 was examined in detail on the hidden spiral shaped circuit l in this work the task 1 is considered that l is the spiral contour of the endless length the regional task of riemann 5 in the class of limited layerly analytical functions on such a circuit was investigated in 3 5 2 consider first the task 1 in the case of g t 0 this is the uniform task of riman f t g t f t t l 6 for p analytical function f z z in g t g t it comes down to the homogeneous problem of the riemann ng t g t ng t t l 7 for the analytical function z we examine this task in detail using the results previously obtained in 3 5 let the curve l t t t t s r s exp i s s 0 8 where s is arc abscissa r s s continuously differentiated material functions r s 0 s 0 lims ger r s 0 lims ger s this spiral l belongs to the class s m where m is the natural number 0 1 if imes 0 rm s r s 1 1 ds ds ds 9 for a fixed point z c l we denote the point l closest to z if there are several such points then we take any of them the spiral l belongs to the class s 0 m s m if it has a property z 10 through z we denote the arg tz where the branch of the argument is highlighted using a cut according to l enter class t n n natural number 0 1 the material functions t the times differentiated according to taylor at point 0 i e t t t n 0 t 11 where p t polin degree not higher than n 0 t satisfies the helder condition with an indicator 0 t h 0 0 0 these conditions uniquely determine the functions 0 and p in decomposition 11 see 6 c 86 130 let in the problem 1 l s m and the coefficient of the task g t is a real function and has the form g t g t exp t t t m and either or 1 suppose that there is the final limit limz 0 zp z ln z 1 let the number equal to 1 if it is the whole and the function zp z ln z not limited from above with a small z and equal i e an entire part of the number in other cases the theorem 1 3 p 83 let in the problem 7 spiral l s 0 m the function g t g t exp t t t m 0 1 and there is the final limit of and the index 0 then the homogeneous task of riemann 7 has 1 linearly independent limited solutions and the general view of its solution is z z z p z x z expp 1 2 i l t dt t z 12 p z polin degree not higher if the limit is final and 0 then a homogeneous task 7 does not have non trivial solutions note that the integral type of koshi in 12 for the locally indestructible circuit l is understood in the sense of the inexplicable integral of riemann by substituting the found value onic z in 2 we get a solution to the problem 1 provided g t 0 consequence 1 let the problem 1 l s 0 m g t g t expp t t t m 0 1 g t 0 let the final limit and index 0 then the general solution of the problem 1 in the class p analytical functions has the form f z z p 1 z z p z p 1 z def z p z 2 p the condition of the limb can be replaced with two conditions with the curve l in general equivalent limitations least limz 0 z ln z 1 limz 0 z ln z 1 inous we introduce another limit 0 lims min z r s zp z ln z 1 the investigation 2 fair approval a if 0 then the task 6 does not have non trivial solutions 131 b if 0 urb inous
