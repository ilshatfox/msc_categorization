the study of non linear gravimagnetic shock waves in the computer mathematics system for gravimagnetic shock waves gmv was called the class of accurate solutions of the self compiled system of the equations of hydrodynamics and maxwell s equations against the background of an accurate plain sophimonymic solution of einstein s equations bondi pirani robbinson metrics the solution contains physical singularity on a certain wave surface on which the invariant physical characteristics of the plasma are singular to eliminate the singularity in 1 a model equation of energy balance was built taking into account the process of transformation of the energy of a flat gravitational wave into the electromagnetic energy of the plasma y 2 22 y p 1 2 g 2 x 1 where y is the control the function 2 and is the first and second parameters of gmv g x the normalized amplitude of the falling gravitational wave p 4 8 the parameter of the anisotropy of the plasma despite external simplicity the equation is significantly nonlinear and can hardly lend itself on research in 2 10 3 the decision was studied analytically the presence of instability at the point 2 was established since it was not possible to find the exact solution of the energy balance equation which has important astrophysical applications the need arose of its numerical study with large values of the parameter and the small values of the lection parameter the equation belongs to the class class 4 and this is what the difficulties of the first attempts to study it were associated in this work the mathematica 5 2 computer mathematics system built a programmatic procedure for a numerical solution to the energy balance equation 1 based on the implicit method of adams of the second order the constructed procedure made it possible to conduct a study of numerical solutions 1 depending on the first and second parameters of the gmv and build a more complete model of the response of magnetoactive plasma on the gravitational wave as well as calculate the physical characteristics of the plasma in fig 1 shows the characteristic features of the solution in the rigid area of the parameters consisting in the formation of the plateau section 0 25 1 5 the development of instability near x 2 11 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 1 25 1 5 1 75 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 1 2 1 4 fig 1 the results of the numerical integration of the equation 1 50 2 0 0001 l and t e r and a 1 ignat ev y g gravitation cosmology 1995 v 1 no 4 p 287 2 ignat ev y g gravitation cosmology 1996 v 2 no 4 p 213 3 ignat ev y g gravitation cosmology 1998 v 2 p 240 4 hirere nursetts vannerg solution of ordinary differential equations tough tasks m mir 1999 12
