the automatic continuity of positive operators is well known positive linear display in ordered banach spaces with some additional assumptions are automatically continuous apparently the strongest result in this direction belongs to g ya lozanovsky see 1 chap 6 2 2 theorem 1 2 1 3 consequence 6 the purpose of this message is to summarize the result of lozanovsky in particular in the event of metriezed topological vector spaces recall that the wedge is the subset of the material vector space satisfying the conditions k k k k k r the wedge k is called a cone if k k 0 let x f space with invariant metric and x x 0 x x see 4 ii 1 we will say that the wedge k in x has an assembly if the convergence of the numerical series is xn xn k entails convergence in the x series xn to an element from k theorem let x 1 and x 2 two f space with wedges k 1 and k 2 and the wedge k 1 gives rise to x 1 i e x 1 k 1 k 1 and has assembly and k 2 a closed cone then any linear operator from x 1 to x 2 translating k 1 to k 2 is continuous consequence let the x 1 and x 2 be two full metrhysable topological vector spaces with closed cones of positive elements k 1 and k 2 and k 1 gives rise to x 1 then any linear positive operator from x 1 to x 2 is continuous the work was supported by the program universities of russia fundamental research project ur 04 01 011 86 l and t r a t r a 1 wulikh b z special issues of the geometry of cones in normal spaces kalinin kalininsky state university 1978 84 p 2 krasnoselsky m a lifshitz e a sobolev a v positive linear systems method of positive operators m science the main version of the physical and mathematical literature 1985 256 p 3 abramovich y a aliprantis c d positive operators handbook of the geometry of banach spaces vol 1 w b johnson and j lindenstrauss eds amsterdam elsevier 2001 p 85 122 4 dunford n schwartz j linear operators general theory m publishing house of foreign literature 1962 896 p n s vyacheslavov e p mochalina moscow mochalina 77 yandex ru on rational approximations of functions like makarov stiltyes in the hard hp space for any element f of its smallest deviation from the totality of rn hp rational functions of the degree above n denote through hprn f in the assumption that the measure is absolutely continuous on the segment 1 1 and its density with some a b 1 satisfies the condition x 1 x a 1 x b with x 1 x 1 1 1 denote z 1 1 d x 1 xz theorem 1 n s vyacheslavov let the parameters p 1 a b 1 p are fixed and weak asymptotic 1 is fair is the average harmonic numbers a 1 p and b 1 p theorem 2 e p mochalina we fix the parameter p from the interval 0 1 and the measure the density of which satisfies the condition 1 87
