the vector case of the theory of style orthogonal polynomials and operators the classical theory of stiltyes 1 connects the problem of the points on the semi axles with the continuous fraction of style and some sequence of orthogonal polynomials the problem of the moments can also be considered as part of the problem of self intended expansion of a certain operator known as the jacobi operator 2 the continuous fraction of style and the orthogonal polynomials associated with it play an important role in analyzing the spectral properties of the jacobi operator the tasks of rational approximations with a common denominator to a set of functions approximation of the hermita pad lead to the need to study polynomial systems orthogonal in relation to a set vector of measures such systems of polynomials are called polynomials of joint orthogonality or vector orthogonal polynomials the most important characteristic property of vector orthogonal polynomials is the presence of a high order recurrent ratio that connects them the study of which is equivalent to the study of a certain vector continuous fraction 3 the same recurrent ratio allows you to associate with the system of vector orthogonal polynomials of some 120 rh asymmetric diverse operator for which the initial set of measures can be considered as a vector of spectral measures 4 among the wide class of systems of vector orthogonal polynomials and the corresponding operators the systems and operators in their properties are close to the classical case of style 5 it is interesting to note that these same operators play an important role in the analysis of some non linear chains of mathematical physics associated with the discrete equation of kp 5 the report will tell you about the results and open problems of the vector theory of stiltyes recently operators for simplicity of presentation we limit ourselves to an occasion of orthogonality in relation to the vector of 2 measures consider the following asymmetric tape matrix with two extreme non equal diagonals l 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 a 1 0 0 1 0 0 a 2 0 0 1 0 0 a 3 0 0 1 1 the matrix l determines in the space of sequences l 2 a certain closed operator which we will denote the same symbol we denote the canonical basis l 2 through en ughter we call the following functions the functions of the veil operator fj z rzej 1 e 0 j 1 2 here the operator l and x y indicates the scalar product in the complex space l 2 through the rz operator l is limited when and only when the condition is complied with the supn an imes in this case the operator s weil s functions have the following decomposition into a series of laurent in the vicinity of infinity row of the neuman fj z lkej 1 e 0 zk 1 z l 2 for each j 1 2 of the number f j k l kej 1 e 0 we call the moments of 121 operators l associated with the fj z function the special structure of the matrix 1 gives f j n 0 n 6 3 k j 1 k 0 put s j k f j 3 k j 1 k 0 and introduce the new system of functions sj z using equations fj z z 3 jsj z 3 j 1 2 then instead of decomposition 2 we have sj z icle k 0 s j k z k 1 the starting point of our study is the following results proven in 5 theorem 1 let for all n 1 performed an 0 then there is a system of positive measures j j 1 2 with a common carrier on 0 urb such that s j k xkd j x k 0 3 theorem 2 subject to an 0 n 1 operator l is limited and only when the total carrier of measures j j 1 2 is a limited set in conditions of theorem 1 function sj z are functions such as stiley sj z 0 d j x z x j 1 2 4 system of measures j or what is the same system stiltyesian functions 4 can be considered as spectral data of the operator l determined by the matrix 1 in connection with the presentation 4 many interesting tasks arise consider some of them vector fraction of style the following decomposition of the functions vector s 1 s 2 in vector continuous fraction s 1 s 2 1 1 0 z 1 a 1 0 1 1 a 2 0 1 1 a 3 0 z 1 a 4 0 1 5 where the circulation of the vector is defined using the jacobineron rule 5 fraction 5 is an obvious analogue of the classic continuous stiff fraction it is well known that the classic style of style converges and only when 122 the corresponding problem of the moments of style is definite the task of convergence of the vector fraction is more complex and interesting outractions of the operator we recognize the operator through the l 0 for which an 1 for all values n 1 and through 0 j j 1 2 of stiltyus measures associated with it provided lim an 1 operator l is the compact indignation of the operator l 0 the task of determining the spectral measures of the operator l through disturbance an 1 and measures 0 j is of fundamental importance
