makai inequality for torsional rigidity l i gafiyatullina r g salakhudinov using methods from 3 we prved a generalization of the makai inequality for convex domains keywords torsional rigidity euclidean moments of a domain with respect to the boundary isoperimetric inequalitis distance fundarone to the bundary of ad domain udc 517 584 on zero combinations of works of cylindrical functions a a gimaltdinova 1 1 alfiragimaltdinova mail ru the ufa state oil technical university explores zeros of functions which is the sum of the works of bessel functions with opposite indices keywords bessel function modified function of bessel many zeros of function in the study of spectral tasks for degenerating equations of a mixed type namely when finding its own values it becomes necessary to find zeros of the function of the species f t j t i t i t j t 0 1 1 106 materials of the international school conference at re t 0 the study of zeros of combinations of works of cylindrical functions is dedicated to a relatively small number of studies for example the reference book 1 shows the tables of the first roots of the equation j x n kx j kx n x 0 for some values k and and the roots of the equation in x j n x jn x i n x 0 for n 0 1 2 3 in some cases the combinations of the works of bessel functions are elementary functions and then the question of their roots is solved elementary for example 2 c 91 j z y 1 z y z j 1 z z z i z i 1 z i z i 1 z 2 sin z the book 3 shows a review of works devoted to the study of zeros of functions containing works of subsitrinal functions but function 1 or similar ones are not investigated it is given the formula j z i z sin 0 f 3 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 z 4 64 sin z 2 2 1 2 0 f 3 1 3 2 3 2 3 2 z 4 64 2 where 0 f 3 1 a b c z generalized hypergeometric function given the formula 2 function 1 you can lead to type f t 2 sin 0 f 3 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 t 4 64 however in the literature known to us there are no statements regarding its roots for the function the theorem is fair equation j t i t i t j t 0 0 1 3 has a counting variety of positive roots t 1 k and a counting set of purely imaginary roots roots i t 2 k with a positive imaginary part proof 1 let t x r due to the fact that x 0 i x 0 i x 0 from the equation 3 we get j t i t j t i t 4 in this case the function f 1 t j t i t has the same zeros as the function j t and the function f 2 t j t i t the same zeros as the function j t by the theorem about the separation of the roots 4 p 136 due to the fact that the functions of j t and j t are linearly independent solutions of the bessel equation non kissed number zeros of the functions j t and j t are mutually divided therefore and zeros functions f 1 and f 2 are also mutually divided this means that between any two neighboring yu a gladyshev v v kalmanovich 107 roots of function f 1 there is exactly one root of the f 2 function and vice versa from this due to the continuity of both of these functions we will get that their graphs intersect exactly at one point at each interval between any two neighboring roots of the jerg t as well as between any two adjacent roots of the j haro t this means that equation 4 has a counting set of positive roots and knowing the zeros of the functions j t and j t we can separate the intervals on which the roots of the equation are located 4 2 let t i y c y erro r reasoning similarly we get that the equation i i y j i y i i y j i y has a counting many purely imaginary zeros a remark the question is not clarified whether the equation 3 has other comic roots that are different from the purely imaginary you can make sure that the justice of the same statement for the equation j t i t i t j t 0 0 1 the work was performed with financial support to the rffi project 17 41 020516 literature 1 janka e emde f lesh f special functions formulas graphs tables m nauka 1977 344 p 2 beitman g erdeyi a higher transcendental functions t 2 bessel functions functions of the parabolic cylinder orthogonal polynomials m nauka 1974 296 p 3 luke yu special mathematical functions and their approximation m mir 1980 608 p 4 three part f differential equations m ill 1962 352 p on zeros of combinations of products of cylindrical functions a a gimaltdinova zeros of a function that is the sum of products of bessel functions with opposite indices are investigated keywords the bessel function the modified bessel function the set of zeros of the function udc 517 9 on the use of the apparatus of generalized degrees of bers to build basic solutions of the equations of the highest order yu a gladyshev 1 v v kalmanovich 2
