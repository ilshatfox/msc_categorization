the characterization of the trace by the degree inequalities below through mn we denote the linear space of all n nmotor above the field of complex numbers through the mhn the subset of the ermi 45 of the 45 th matrix through m n the subset of m h n positively the semi subject matrix for x y mhn the recording x y means that y x m n for the matrix x mhn and the material function f the determination area of which contains the spectrum x the value f x mhn is determined by the final version of the spectral theorem in particular for x m n and any p 1 the xp matrix is correctly determined for x y mhn absolute meaning xy it is defined as y x 2 y 1 2 through m n we denote many linear functionals on mn taking non negative values on m n theorem for the functionality onic m n the execution of each of the following conditions entails that wor is a scalar multiple of the trace i for some numbers p q 1 1 p 1 q 1 p 6 2 for any matrix x y m n is performed helder s inequality onic xy onic xp 1 p accord y q 1 q ii for some numbers p q 1 1 p 1 q 1 for any matrix x y m n is the yunga inequality xy 1 p xp 1 q gment y q iii for some p 1 for any such matrices x y m n that x y is inequality of monotony ising y p as you know for the trace the above inequalities occur and thus each of the conditions i ii iii characterizes the trace consequence the functionality onic m n is a scalar multiple of the trace and only when wor ex onic ey for any such x y mhn which x y we also note that the above results allow generalization in case of functionals and weights on c and w algebrah the work was supported by the program universities of russia fundamental research project ur 04 01 011 46
