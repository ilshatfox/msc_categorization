mathematical modeling of the processes of transfer in the channel formed by two cylinders within the framework of the free molecular regime solved the problem of the heat massive in a long channel formed by two cylinders the radius of the r 1 and r 2 which form the paralle of the lolne and the axes are shifted relative to each other by the distance a the channel maintain constant gradients of tours and pressure temperatures as the main equation describing the process of the process the equation of williams was used recorded in the cylindrical coordinate system 1 and in the form of the boundary condition on the wall of the canal a diffusion model the deviation of the gas state from the equilibrium is supposed to be small which allows you to get a solution to the problem in a linarized form to find a linear amendment to the local moral distribution function the task is reduced to the solution of a linear uniform differential equalization in private derivatives of the first order c cos z ro c z z z sin z z 1 0 1 74 o v hermider v n popov with boundary conditions z r 1 c 0 cos 0 2 z onic c 0 2 2 a cos a 2 1 n 2 c 0 3 where c the polar coordinates of the vector of the gas molecules in the space of velocities r 1 r 1 r 2 a a r 2 with the dimensionless velocity of gas molecules n 2 normal vector to the surface of the second cylinder directed into the gas n 2 c is a scalar product of these vectors the solution of equation 1 with boundary conditions 2 constructed using the method of characteristics and has the form z onic c cos r 21 2 sin 2 c 6 6 z c cos a cos onic 1 sin a sin onic 2 c 6 6 2 22 2 arccos 2 r 21 using the obtained solution the mass velocity vector in the channel was built and the values of heat and mass flow through the cross section of the canal were found an analysis of the obtained solutions was carried out in the limit case when the cylinder axes coincide it is shown that in this case the results obtained in the work are transferred to similar reckonings obtained for coaxial cylinders the work was performed with financial support in the framework of the state assignment creation of computational infra of the structure to solve high tech applied problems about ect no 3628 v i zhegalov e a sozontov 75 l and tr tor u r a 1 latysheva v yushkanova a kinetic equations like williams and their exact solutions monograph m mgou 2004 271 p v i zhegalov e a sozontova kazan volga federal university vzhegalov yandex ru sozontova elena rambler ru gurs s task is considered to solve the problem of gurs in the work in the area d x 0 x 1 y 0 y y 1 find the regular solution of the equation uxy aux buy cu f 1 satisfying the conditions u x 0 y onic y u x y 0 x onic y 0 x 0 x x 0 x 1 y x 0 x 1 2 it is known that the task 1 2 is definitely solved once cases of resolving this task in quadrature are given in 1 p 15 16 2 3 the aim of our study is to highlight new cases of resolving the task in quadrature the results can be formulated in terms of the following ratios 2 h lnh xy k 0 3 h 2 1 x 1 y 6 0 k 3 1 x 1 y 6 0 4
