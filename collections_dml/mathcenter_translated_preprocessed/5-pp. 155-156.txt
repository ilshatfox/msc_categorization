periodic generalized convex functions we study the 27 g periodic functions f x family which is determined by the fact that at each interval a b the length of b a 7 g of the functions of this family are sub u i function in the sense of e in the sense of f bekkenbach 1 generating the functions g 1 x and 92 x are set as linearly independent solutions of the equation of the species in 11 p x u 1 q x y o 155 we solve a number of extreme problems in this family periodic analogue of convex functions in particular for 271 periodic sub 1 functions an ttogi of the neglies of adamar of for example 2 j and the theorems of the miles 3 namely we prove that f a b a f x dx f a f b a under conditions b g a g b 2 qi a b a 9 i x dx i 1 2 a and find points of the minimum of the function b p s j x ts x dx a where ts x is the supporting function for j x at the point s in addition we show that in some cases the functions of this family are realized as indicators of the growth of entire solutions of the equation by the underwear the author expresses deeply to the scientific manner of detadel f g avhadiev for help in the work literature 1 bt ckenbach e f generalized sop 111 ex fu nctions bull amer matl 1 soc 1937 v 43 r 363 371 2 dragomir s s and mond m integral inequalites of hadamard type for log convex function demonstr vlath 1998 v 31 r 355 364 3 miles m j ap extremum property of convex function american math monthly 1969 v 76 r 921 922 156
