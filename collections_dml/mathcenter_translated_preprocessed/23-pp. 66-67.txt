algebras over the opead of the graphs let g n are many symmetrical n n matrices the components of which belong to the two element boulevium algebra 0 1 the elements of this set are the matrix of the adjacency of graphs possibly with loops without multiple ribs we also determine the component g 0 consisting of an empty matrix which corresponds to a column without vertices by analogy with 1 we determine the operation of the composition g m g n 1 g nm g n 1 nm is as follows ab 1 bm a 11 b 1 a 12 a 1 m a 21 a 22 b 2 a 2 m am 1 am 2 amm bm where aij aijjninj jninj is the ni nj size matrix consisting of units aii bi a matrix obtained from bi adding aii to each bi element theorem 1 regarding the introduced operation of the composition g g n n 1 is an operation with a single element matrix 0 the gar of the g is also an epi operation in the sense of 2 and is generated as an epi operation with a graph of two peaks connected by one rib and an empty graph of two peaks theorem 2 the diversity of the algebra over the glg g opead g is rationally equivalent to the variety of algebra with two binary operations of the 68 zhenya multiplication and constant satisfying the following ten identities a 1 a 2 a 2 a 1 a 1 a 2 a 2 a 1 a 1 a 1 a 1 a 1 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 1 a 2 a 3 a a a a a a a a a a a a a a 1 a 2 a 3 a 1 a 2 a 1 a 3 a 1 a 2 a 1 a 2 a 2 a 3 a 1 a 3 the work was supported by rocr rt project no 05 5 1284 l and tr trin 1 trinin s n semenova a v opeads of the final marked chairs of fov izv universities mathematics 2004 no 4 c 50 60 2 trinin s n abstract clones and operates sib mat journal 2002 t 43 no 4 s 924 936 a i stukachev novosibirsk aistu math nsc ru about models allowed in the permissible sets for arbitrary permissible set a discusses the concepts of permitted limitedly permitted calculated in the algebraic system it is shown that if the m 1 percussion system in hf m then in hf m there is a universal function and fair principle of reduction but the principle of uniformization is not always carried out there is a theorem 1 let m 1 percussion in hf m then hf m has the property of uniforms in that case when some existential cheekbone enrichment of the m system m is calculated in hf m a description of the permitted models permitted in the hf and supervisors generalizing the nurtazin theorem 1 theorem 2 for the computable system m and n the following conditions are equivalent 1 m n percussion in hf m 2 for any n m n n percussion relative to d n 69
