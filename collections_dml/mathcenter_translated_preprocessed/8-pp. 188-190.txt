the boundary values of polyanalytic functions let the anl 2 d denotes the space of all nanalitic in the area d z z 1 functions for which the norm is finite f 2 d d f z 2 dxdy 1 2 mm it is known that any function f anl 2 d is the only 188 way can be represented in the form see 1 f z n k 1 k 1 zk 1 1 zz k 1 fk 1 z 1 where fk 1 al 2 d k 1 2 n as usual hp d 1 p means the space of har di theorem let f anl 2 d then d 1 z 2 f z z 2 dxdy mm fk 1 h 2 d k 1 2 n and almost everywhere on d there are angular boundary values of the polyanalytic function f moreover f n k 1 1 k 1 k 1 k 1 fk 1 d a similar statement is true for polyanalytic functions f in which in the view 1 all components fk 1 k 1 2 n belong to the space h 1 d the work was supported by the russian federation project 99 01 00119 189 l and t r a t ramazanov a k the representation of the space of polyanalytic functions in the form of a direct sum of orthogonal subspace appendix to rational approximations matem notes 1999 t 66 no 5 c 741 759 k m rasulov smolensk about the non modified regional task of the neumann type for meta analytical functions if the final single link area on the plane of the computer alks variable z x iy limited by a simple smooth closed contour l through t denote the addition of t l to a complete integrated plane everywhere in the future we will use the designations and terminology adopted in 1 the following regional task is considered it is required to find all the meta analytical functions of the f z class m 2 t h 2 l which satisfy on the lredit condition f t n g t f t g t 1 where n is a derivative of the internal normal and g t g t specified on l functions h l with g t 0 the task 1 is the task of the neumann in the class of meta analytical functions therefore with g t 6 0 t l the formulated task will be called a modified task of the type of neuman for meta analytical functions moreover if g t 0 the task 1 is called homogeneous the task of the neumann i e the task 1 for g t 0 in the class of meta analytical functions is not neter since meta analytical in the circle t z z 1 functions f z zn 1 z zn exp 0 z where n is an arbitrary natural number and 0 any integrated number are solutions to a homogeneous problem of neumann 190
