the boundary values of the integral of the koshi on the self like fractal curve let are the closed zordanov curve on the complex plane and f t the function set on it if the curve is hidden and f l then with z 6 the function f z 1 2 i dt t z 1 called the cosa integral in this paper the integral 1 is studied in a situation where the curve is fractal and therefore unearthly despite this the integral exists with certain restrictions on and f let x are continuous monotonously increasing at x 0 the function is such that 0 0 the curve is called sprinkled if sup j rune zj zj 1 ger where supremum takes on all the final sequences of the points z 0 z 2 zj technology in the manner of bypass regarding the function f we assume that it satisfies the condition of the h lder with the indicator 0 1 it can be shown that the integral 1 exists as an integral of the style provided that the row is motor n 1 onic 1 1 n where onic is a function inverse to further the closed curve is called self like if for each point t can indicate its arc 132 the image of which is transformed by the likeness z 7 t k z z z z z z z z t 0 k 1 is also an arc on the curve theorem let the self like curve is sprayed and the function of the function f satisfies on it satisfies the condition of the h lder with indicator if the function is x convex and its reverse function onic x satisfies the inequality 1 x cx for some 0 c 0 and all fairly small x then the integral of the cossack 1 has continuous boundary values at each point t when approaching it from both sides this theorem shows to what extent the self mileage of the curve allows you to weaken the conditions of the border the values of the integral 1 obtained for the entire class of sprayed curves in 1 l and t e r a t r a 1 katz b a continuity integrated koshi on my indestructuring my curve tr matte center named after n i lobachevsky t 5 act problem matte and fur mater mezh scientific conf kazan october 1 3 2000 kazan unipress 2000 s 102 103 a i kozlov m yu kokurin yoshkar ola ittative methods of the gradient type for finding quasi of irregular non linear operator equations are considered the equation f x 0 where f h 1 h 2 non linear twice differentiated by the gato h 1 h 2 hilbert space in cases where the resolution of the original equation is not guaranteed the task of finding its quasi playing is set i e points x which delivers a minimum to h 1 the functionality of the miserable ffic x 12 f x 2 we believe that instead of the exact operator f x only its approximation f h 1 h 2 which has in the vicinity r points x about 133
