permissible sets of the author studied the ratios between the ratios of the properties of the descriptive theory of sets on permissible sets for this methods of both the classical theory of computing and the theory of sets and the theory of models are used first we recall some basic definitions model a signature is called a permissible set if a is the model kpu and a fundamally we limit ourselves to the consideration of the permissible sets of only the final signature an important example of the permissible set is the hereditary final superstructure let m the signature model with the main set m then hf 0 m m hfn 1 m hfn m p hfn m where n p x is many final subsidence of the set x hf m n pi m in this case hf m is a hereditary superstructure over the model m considered as a signature model u where uhf m m on permissible sets a b can be set n a b predicates as predicates defined in a formulas and formulas at the same time partial function f is called a calculated if f a v p predicat it is known that a is a subject on hf m over the model m of the final signature if only if it can be 61 specified by some computable in the classical sense sequence an n sets consisting of hedel numbers color signature form let a and b permissible sets we will say that a es is to b and denote as a ve b if there is such a display b on a that 1 c will be binary b v p predicate for any binary a v p predicate c let a permissible set the family s p a is called computable in a if there is such a binary a v p predicat q that s b q a b a a a v the function f x y is called universal if for any one scale partial a b the functions are such a a that f a y y any allowable set a contains as a b subset through le and j le we will denote the upper half sections of e spectacles and ideals of e spectacles of subsets is correspondingly let s a family of predicates of arbitrary nature the principles of uniforms reduction separation and continuity are understood for s in a conventional smell s satisfies the principle of enforcement if for any non empty a s there is such f on a that f s s satisfies the principle of quasi cesspiability if for any a s there is such f b on a that f s they say that the permissible set satisfies the principle p if the family of all a b p predicates satisfies p they say that the ideal i j le satisfies the principle p if i satisfies p 1 the design permissible sets 7 hereditary final superstructures theorem 1 2004 for any permissible set a there is such a model ma signature q 4 that 1 a e hf ma 2 a is listed if only if hf ma is listed 62 3 a quasi if only if hf ma is quasi list 4 a satisfies the principle of uniforms if only if hf ma satisfies the principle of uniforms 5 a satisfies the principle of reduction if only if hf ma satisfies the principle of reduction 6 a satisfies the principle of separation if only if hf ma satisfies the principle of separation 7 a satisfies the principle of continuation if only if hf ma satisfies the principle of continuation 8 a has a universal a b the function if only if hf ma has a universal hf ma in function 2 the design j le 7 hereditarily final superstructures theorem 2 2002 a s morozov v g puzarenko let a permissible many then the a b family n subset is closed relative to e prodigal and operation we denote through ie a the family of e spectacles of all a b n subset from theorem 2 it follows that ie a will be an element j le through sap a we denote the class of all the submarines computers in the families drying 1 let the permissible sets a and b are such that a ve b then s a s b in particular ie a 6 ie b theorem 3 2002 a s morozov v g puzarenko for any ideal i j le such a class ki is elementary equivalent to hereditary final buildings that ie a i for any a ki theorem 4 2002 2004 for the sequence ki ief le built for the proof of theorem 3 the following is true 1 for any permissible set a there is such hf m 0 kie a that hf m 0 ve a a 63 2 i satisfies the principle of separation continuity if only if hf m 0 satisfies the principle of separation continued for any hf m 0 ki 3 i has a universal function if only if hf m 0 has a universal hf m 0 in function for any hf m 0 ki 4 hf m 0 does not satisfy the principle of reduction for any i j le and hf m 0 ki the term i has a universal function is understood in the following sense theorem 5 2002 let hf m 0 ki i
