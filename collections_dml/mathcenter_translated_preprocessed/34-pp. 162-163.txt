affin vector fields of the direct work of projective evcual spaces of the affinated connectedness of m b morgun penza persian pedagogical pedagogical university in the work examine the structure of algebra lee infinisia of male affinated transformations of a direct work about the telecommunication spaces of affinated coherence in this work the indexes take the following values i j 1 n n 1 n m let mn 1 and nm 2 projective euclidean about the wanderings of the affinity of non zero curvature that is the coherence of 1 and 2 do not have twists the tensors of weil 1 w and 2 w are zero and 1 r 6 0 2 r 6 0 in the standard way we build a direct work of these spaces mn nm 1 2 we denote through g mn nm the algebra whether infinitic surveys of this space recall that the vector field x g mn nm is and only when lx 0 1 in local coordinates this equation is equivalent to a system of differential equations in private derivatives of the second order the first series of conditions for the integration of this system is equivalent to the lxr 0 equation where r 1 r 2 r given the conditions of 1 w 0 and 2 w 0 from equality lxr 0 we get the ratio rklx i 0 r x j 0 according to the condition of the projective euclidean and crooked tensors 1 r and 2 r are non zero therefore the corresponding tenzo 164 ricci is also non zero therefore x i 0 x j 0 since x i x i x j jx x i depend only on x 1 xn x only from xn 1 xn m that is x 1 x 2 x where 1 x 2 x are vector fields on mn and nm respectively the results obtained lead to the conclusion that the equation 1 of the space mn nm is a system l 1 x 1 0 l 2 x 2 0 thus the theorem has been proven algebra lee infinitezimal affin transformations g mn nm of direct work of projective eclidic spaces of affinated connectedness lays a direct sum of algebrus of infinitiasis of affinable transformations g mn and g nm data of the projective evcual spaces of affinated connectedness the space of smooth functions of a given growth near the border of the cone i x musin p v fedotova institute of mathematics with the uc ras polina 81 rambler ru let is an open convex cone in rn 6 rn determine the space e accord of smooth functions to as follows let h k k 1 a sequence of positive convex functions that satisfies the conditions 165
