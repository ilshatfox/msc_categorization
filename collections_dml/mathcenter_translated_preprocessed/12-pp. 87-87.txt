the system of circular plates connected to each other along the arcs of the boundary circle of a yo zemlyanova tfuvask state university e mai azem chuvsu ru examines two tasks of the theory of elasticity for circular plates in the first task the tense state of the circular plates system is the same about the radius and endless plates from the circles of the same radius the plates are applied to each other and are connected along the general boundary circle the specified load of ci is attached to the plates with circular cuts at infinity the method of sedate rows found complex pots and stresses in the plates examples are considered the second task considers a system consisting of two crooked 1 mstin of the same radius and endless ru astin with a circle with a neckline of the same radius connected along the arcs of the boundary of the rulis dailed to the cargo at infinity are attached to the plate with a circular neckline the method of the matrix regional task of riemann found complex potentials their behavior was studied near the contsechnaries of the connection line and the intensity of voltages near these ends depends on four actual coefficients cases of the connection of the plates along one arc and two symmetrical arcs are considered in detail voltage graphs and coefficients of voltage intensity were built the work was supported by the rffi project 01 01 00720 87
