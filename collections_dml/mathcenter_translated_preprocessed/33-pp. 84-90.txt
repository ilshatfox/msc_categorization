the solution to the reverse problem of restoring the parameters of the freindlich isotherm with a gradient method 1 l a babich e a kosterin kazan state university kazan superior layer of the soil is a natural barrier on the path of various pollution from the surface of the soil to the aquifers in this case the ability of the soil is important in this way of soil is almost all types of pollution when modeling sorption processes in a porous environment the isotherms of langmur and freindlich are most often used 3 5 7 8 the numerical parameters of the isotherm depend on the properties of the soil and the sorbicted substance this work is devoted to the construction of the mathematical method of restoration according to the experimental data of the numerical values of the parameters of the freindlich a c k cp 1 where a c is the amount of substance captured by the soil c is the concentration of the substance in the pores of the soil k 0 and p 0 numerical parameters depending on the specific pair of soil country rice 1 the experiment diagram is assumed that the following experiment was conducted fig 1 there is a horizontal soil column with a soil sample the 1 st work was carried out with the financial support of the rffif project no 04 0100484 84 l a babich e a kosterin first soil is impregnated with clean water until completely saturated then a solution of a certain substance of the known concentration c 0 is supplied the substance moves through the soil profile due to the diffusion mechanism part of the substance penetrating the soil is sorbed by particles of the soil over time the substance reaches the opposite boundary of the soil sample during the experiment the concentration of a substance on the right border of the sample is measured it is believed that the cross section of the column is much more than the thickness of the sample then the task of spreading a substance in the column will be one dimensional the task of finding k and p corresponding to experimental data can be formulated as the task of finding a minimum of the functionality of j k p t 0 cobs t ccmp l t 2 dt 2 where t is the duration the experiment l is the thickness of the soil sample cobs t concentration at the output obtained from the experiment ccomp l t concentration at the output obtained as a result of solving a direct problem a direct task that simulates the process of spreading a substance in a column has the form of t mc a c d 2 c x 2 0 x l t 0 3 a c k c p signc 4 c c 0 x 0 t 0 5 d c x c x l t 0 6 c 0 0 6 x 6 l t 0 7 here m is porosity d is the diffusion coefficient equation 3 is the equation of the balance of the mass of a water soluble substance taking into account the processes of diffusion and sorption 1 at the entrance the concentration is constant and equal to c 0 at the output the sample is washed by the flow of 85 the solution of the reverse problem on the restoration of parameters intensity 0 at the time of the beginning of the experiment an admixture in the sample is absent the ratio 1 is replaced by the ratio 4 this allows you to not enter in the problem 3 7 an additional restriction on the value of the desired function c x t 0 for all x and t note that in the case of c x t 0 the ratio 4 coincides c 1 the differential task 3 7 was recorded in dimensionless variables and was approximated by an implicit variable scheme on a uniform grid with a pitch of time and h by spatial variable on a fixed temporary layer for p 1 the variety diagram has the form mc a c t i dcxx i i 1 n 1 ci c 0 i 0 mc a c t i 2 h dcx i 2 h ci 0

babich e a kosterin to find a minimum of the functionality 2 a gradient method was used 2 kl 1 kl lj k kl p l p l 1 p l lj p kl p l l 0 1 2 8 the l coefficient was selected in various ways option 1 we choose the initial value of the multiplier 0 for example 0 100 if when moving in the direction of the anti grading with this multiplier the functionality does not decrease divide the multiplier in half if the functionality value has decreased we proceed to the next iteration putting l 1 equal to the last value of the multiplier on the previous iteration option 2 we choose the initial value of the multiplier 0 for example 0 0 1 if with such a coefficient in the direction of the anti gradient the value of the functionality decreases we put l 1 2 l if l is too large the functionality of the functionality begins to grow then we put l l 2 thus in the process of iteration l it increases
