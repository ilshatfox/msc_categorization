the local properties of harmonic display let d is the area of the complex plane c w f z d c harmonic display the point z 0 d is called a special point of display f if in any its surroundings f is not bunctional 1 a necessary and sufficient condition for the presence of features at point z 0 is the appeal to the jf jf z fz 2 fz 2 display f at this point the isolated zero of jacobian is answered by the branching points special points of the unstable type in the theory of disasters stable features of smooth display of euclidean spaces are classified in the two dimensional case only two types of stable features are conveyed the folding points and the assembly point of particular complexity is a description of the behavior of non overgrown harmonic display for such displays jf is not equal to zero in the vicinity of the uninsulated zero of jacobian it is proposed different from 1 a method based on the properties of the hopf differential pper dz 2 fzfzdz 2 associated with a harmonic display f the zero jf jf jf jfs unpertured into the points of jf are analytical curves and are called common folds of display f the orthogonal trajectory of the holomorphic quadratic 74 th differential uction dz 2 is called the analytical curve along which the differential inequality isingz 2 0 theorem 2 is performed let z 0 be the uninvited zero of the jacobian of the unbearable harmonic corry resistant display f point z 0 is a folding point assembly point for f then and only when the total display folder f and orthogonal trajectory of the hopf pper fdz 2 differential passing through point z 0 intersect transversally respectively at the point z 0 the local properties of unused harmonic display which are not cinger resistant are much more complicated the main attention in the report is given to this case l and t r a 1 lizzaik a local properties of light harmonic mappings canad math j 1992 v 44 no 1 p 135 153 2 golubev a a on special points of flat harmonious display the use of functional analysis in the theory of approximations tver 1997 s 47 52 b i golubov moscow an analogue of one hardy theorem to convert fourier uolsh and its application the introduction of even h t the space of hardy the elements of which are 2 periodic intensified functions i e the boundary values of the functions from the space h d d z z 1 the following hardy theorem is known see 1 p 454 theorem a if f h t and f n fourier 75 coefficients
