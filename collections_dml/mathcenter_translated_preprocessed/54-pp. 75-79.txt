dissipative extensions of the integral operator v m brooke 1 1 vladislavbruk mail ru saratov state technical university named after yu a gagarin in the article considers an integral equation with an operator measure for this equation the lagrange formula is established taking into account the presence of single point atoms in an operator using the boundary values a description of dissipative extensions of the minimum symmetric operator generated by this equation is given keywords integral equation operator measure a guilbert space a symmetrical operator a boundary task let h a sepaable calbert space with the norm and a scalar work consider the function 7 p determined on the borelev sets a b and taking values in many limited linear operators acting in h function p is called the operator measure on a b see for example 1 chap 5 p 324 if p is equal to zero on an empty set and for any non overeating borel sets n is true p n 1 n icle 1 p n with a slightly converging nearby further all ir ru p determined on the borelev sets a b continue on a certain segment a b 0 a b 0 a b believing p 0 for all borelevsky sets a b 0 a b we denote the bilate p sup i p i where sup applies to the final sums of non overeating borel sets i the number of bilan p is called variation of measures p on the borelevsky set let the measure p have limited variation on a b then for the mail of all ban a b there is such an operator function lection lection with values in many linear limited operators in h 1 which is for any borelevsky set a b equality p d is true this integral converges in the sense of the usual norm of the opera of the radators and the function is determined unambiguously with the accuracy of the values of the many zero somers 1 chap 5 p 325 the symbol t t 0 denotes t 0 t if t 0 t t t 0 if t 0 t and 0 if t 0 t function h is integrated as it is p to many if there is an integral in the sense of bochner t h t d dp h t suppose that the function h is integrated as it is p to a b 0 then the function y t t t 0 dp h s is continuous on the left in a strong sense t 0 t a b 0 further sp denotes many single point atoms of the measure p i e many of these t a b that p t 0 a lot of sp is nothing more than counting in the next theorem the j linen operator in h with the properties j j j 2 e e identical operator p 1 p 2 q operator measures that have limited variation for a b taking values in many linear limited operators acting in h and measure q self combined i e q q for any borelevsky set it is assumed that measures p 1 p 2 q are continued on the segment a b 0 a b 0 a b described above 76 materials of the international school conference of theorem 1 let f g integrated on a b 0 as q function y 0 z 0 h then for any functions y z type y t y 0 i j t t 0 dp 1 s i j t 0 dq s f s z t z 0 i j t t 0 dp 2 s z s i j t 0 dq s g s a t 0 b 0 t 0 t b 0 fair formula analogue of the lagrange formula c 2 c 1 dq t f t z t c 2 c 1 y t dq t g t i j y c 2 z c 2 i j y c 1 z c 1 c 2 c 1 y t dp 2 t z t c 2 c 1 dp 1 t y t z t tgrp 1 sp 2 c 1 c 2 i jp 1 t y t p 2 t z t t photsq sp 2 c 1 c 2 i jq t f t p 2 t z t tgrp 1 sq c 1 c 2 i jp 1 t y t t q t g t tgr c 1 c 2 i jq t f t q t g t t 0 c 1 c 2 b 0 let the segment l 1 l 2 a b 0 consider many functions measurable in bore with values in h limited to l 1 l 2 continuous on the left on l 1 l 2 in the strong sense and permanent on l 1 l 2 b b 0 we determine the norm equality u l 1 l 2 sup t photo l 1 l 2 u t the resulting banach space we denote c l 1 l 2 ras we look at the equation y t t 0 dp y g t a t 0 b 0 1 where the measure p has a limited variation on a b as above we believe p 0 for all borelev sets b b 0 theorem 2 for any fueling g c a b 0 there is the only solution to the equalization 1 belonging to the space c t 0 ower b 0 where t 0 0 is not enough enough if t 0 a and 0 with t 0 a investigation 1 let t 0 a then for any function g c a b 0 the equation 1 is the only solution belonging to the space c a b 0 the next equation ys t c t s dp ys c h 2 is a particular case of equation 1 for g t c through u t s we denote the operator that puts in two of each element c h the value of the solution ys t equations 2 function t u t s c is a solution to the equation u t s c c t s dp u s c theorem 3 let p q measures with limited variation
