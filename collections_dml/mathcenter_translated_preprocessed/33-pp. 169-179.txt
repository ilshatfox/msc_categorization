the use of dynamic nets in solving the tasks of convection disjuction 1 i v kapirin institute of computational mathematics of the russian academy of sciences moscow introduction in this work considers a three dimensional task of convection disjuisation that occurs when modeling the transfer of impurities in porous media for its numerical solution the end element method proposed by j zhaffre inria is used the peculiarity of which are different methods of approximation for the elliptical and hyperbolic parts of the spatial operator the convective member is clearly calculated the diffusion nicholson nicholson scheme to ensure stability in relation to the mesh number of peckla the upwind technology is used the advantages of the method include conservatism due to the continuity of both convective and diffusion flows formally the second order of accuracy in time and space the solution at each step in time of one global linear system with a symmetrical positively defined matrix acceptable restrictions on stability h compared to completely obvious schemes where h 2 approximation is based on unstructured tetrandal grids which allows you to take into account the complex geometry of the calculated areas locally chop and boil the mesh the technology of automatic rebuilding the grid is proposed depending on the behavior of the solution which allows you to reduce the total operating time of the program due to the smaller number of unknown in the system to obtain higher accuracy in areas where the solution is rapidly changing for example in the tasks of the movement of concentration fronts the 1 st work was carried out with partial financial support of the rffi project no 04 07 90336 and the omn ras program computational and information problems of solving big problems 169 on the use of dynamic nets 1 the setting of the problem and the numerical method of solving it 1 1 the task of convection disengage let is a limited polyhedral region in r 3 with the rice consider the following model task for the simplicity of the presentation homogeneous boundary conditions of the type of the conductor are accepted c t t d c b c f in 0 t c 0 on 0 t 1 1 c g 0 x at t 0 here c is the concentration of the pollutant b is the non verbal vector field of the convective flow f l 2 the function of sources or drains d x symmetrical positively defined tensor of diffusion we denote through s the scalar work in l 2 s moreover we introduce the spaces v l 2 w h div w l 2 3 w l 2 as well as a new variable r is the diffusion stream then you can reformulate the problem 1 1 in a weak mixed setting find such a pair r c w v for which c t v r v b c v f v v v d 1 r w c w 0 w w 1 2 1 2 sampling the problem let h conformal breakdown into tetrahedron we introduce on the h of of the end element spaces vh v and who w let vh the space of functions breaking on the faces of tetrahedron and linear inside them explosive final elements the restriction of wh w means for any inner edge the continuity of the normal component of the vector w from the wh the simplest representative of the wh is the rt 0 h plainar a lower order volume 2 whose basic functions are 170 i v kapirin linear inside the tetrahedron have a single stream through one of the faces of the grid and zero through all the rest concentration c and stream r are approximated in spaces vh and wh respectively mixed end element setting of the problem 1 2 has the form e ventral c t v e p r v e e b c v e e f v e v vh d 1 r w c w 0 hi w sroh the step of the proposed scheme in time consists of three subsidies variables of integration volume dx and ds area are subsequently omitted i e cn 1 2 cn t 2 m e 3 2 div rn 1 2 2 div rn 1 m e bcn m e bcnin nm e fnm m vh e e h 1 3 a ii e c cn t m e div rn div rn 1 2 m e bcn 1 2 m m e bc n 1 2 in out nm nm e fn 1 2 m m vh e e h 1 3 b d 1 rn rn 1 2 w cn c 2 div w 0 w wh 1 3 c iii the tilt limiter is c cn 1 here vh e narrowing vh on the tetrahedron e in step 1 3 a an intermediate concentration is clearly calculated which is used in 1 3 b to find convective members in a step 1 3 b 1 3 c a clear time scheme is used for the approximation of the convective part of the operator and the crane scheme nicholson for the diffusion part moreover to stabilize the scheme in 171 about the use of dynamic nets the convective member uses the upwind technology that is in the integral the concentration of c n 1 2 in out is used from the tetrahedron which has a convective stream in the direction of the external normal to this face positive to implement a step 1 3
