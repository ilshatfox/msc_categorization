the methodology for calculating seismic fluctuations in structures taking into account contact interaction with the ground v g bazhenov n s dyukin nizhny novgorod state university named after n i lobachevsky boyarinovanadya mail ru the problem of the seismic resistance of buildings and structures of acquiring in recent years is significant relevance the analytic description of seismic processes does not take into account the features of the contact interaction of structures with the base and various soil layers with each other which does not allow the use of analytical methods in the calculations of responsible structures therefore 24 creation and development of a numerical methodology are relevant which with mini mininating computational costs will allow you to take into account all the many ways of dynamic interaction between the structure with the soil the developed mathematical model and the methodology of numerical modeling of the behavior of buildings and structures under this national fluctuations take into account the effects of the contact one sided interaction with the soil base and yes the results are satisfactorily consistent with the indicative data with minimal computing costs when building a mathematical model of the task it was assumed that elastic waves when they go to the surface of the soil at right angles when solving a two dimensional problem the sizes of the estimated area of the soil corresponded to the 5 overall dimensions of the building since as for now the deposits of computational experiments in this case the contribution of the waves reflected from the structure becomes insignificant la would have been developed a methodology for restoring the impulse load applied to the entire lower boundary of the multilayer soil massif according to the seismogram known on the surface of the wound on the lateral boundaries of the soil mass of siva an unperturbed decision was set this numerical technique was used to calculate mutual displacements of the soil and buildings of the pump station and the back of the torny compartment of the busher npp and used in assessing the strength of the underground water pipes under the influence of operational and seismic loads when solving two dimensional for the summer cottage a package of dynamics 2 programs was used of course an elemental analysis of two dimensional strength tasks the work was carried out with the support of the rffi project 05 08 33618 25 l and t r a t r a 1 bazhenov v g zfirov s v kochetkov a v et al package of application programs dynamics 2 grase problem surable to styles and plasticity all union interuniversity sat 1987 c 4 13 the non stationary task of group persecution a s bannikov udmurt state university izhevsk in the space of rn n 2 the differential game persons pursuers p 1 p and otching e 1 e the laws of the movement of each of the pursuit of the pi and each of the escaping ej have the form i a t xi ui j a t yj vj ui vj v where xi yj ui vj rn i 1 j 1 a t continuous square matrix of order n v convex compact definition in the differential game from the initial state z 0 x 01 x 0 y 0 1 y 0 office is possible if there are measurable functions v 1 t v t vj t v for all j t 0 such that with any measurable functions u 1 t u t ui t v for all i t 0 there is number s in which the inequalities xi t 6 ys t for all i 1 t 0 at the same time we think that at the time t 0 the management of the escapers are formed on the basis of the z t t xi t yj t and the management of the pursuers on the basis of any conceivable information 26
