the reaction of the elastic e lement of the type of rods and cylshtric shells under the influence of the longitudinal impulse of the strength of a f shirabutdinov kazansj iy state university examined the tasks of the behavior of the elastic rods and circular qi lindric shells under the influence of the proda rnoro impulses of force it is believed that the force is to the end of the force it is applied instantly and remains on the time set in a given period of time the movement of the elements of the opi is carried out by the system of wave differential equations the 125 shifts and inertia of rotation are taught the conditions of the element for the rods are fulfilled and the conditions of articular support were fulfilled and for the cylindrical shell mustache 1 oovia of pinching the decision was carried out two methods the method of final differences and a combined analytical method in the latter case the method of converting laplace is used based on the results of the solution graphs of longitudinal stress are built and forms of wave formation at different points of the time of time are shown ti and the boundaries of the applicability of the ranges bz bath methods the magnitude of the critical time the influence of geometric and mechanical characteristics literature 1 gordienko b a shock pushing elastic systems izv ussr academy of sciences mtt 1971 no 4 s 108 115 the suspicimetric flow of a long body in the absence of a protrusion over the cylindrical surface of v k krasnov m v krasovnov cheboksary cooperative institute of the university of consumer cooperation a dc 1 napononi has the claimed disc dc the difference between this task and the same is considered 126
