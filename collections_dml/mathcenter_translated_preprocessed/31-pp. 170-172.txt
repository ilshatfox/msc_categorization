the ratio of tits on the border of the space of incompatible curvature according to buzeman k v churkin pomeranian state university named after m v lomonosov g arkhangelsk x d is a local compact space of incompatible curvature in the sense of buzeman the compacting of which xh and xg coincides this means that the identical reflection x on itself continues to the homeomorphism of compacting in the case of cat 0 spaceship the icles border has the so called corner metric which gives rise to the metrics of tits td as the corresponding internal metric see 1 we introduce a set of ratios on the border icles which serves as an analogue of the titsa metric in the case we are considering determination 1 let gx and a b r x rays with the beginning x 0 which are in directions of points cil and respectively we will say that the points me and form an angle of less than and write if x 0 lim t urb a t b t 2 t 1 1 otherwise we will say that the angle between hole and is and write the execution of inequality 1 does not depend on the choice of point x 0 a 0 b 0 for arbitrary infinitely removed points ctor gx we assume that 1 td cil if 2 td cil if for any of their surroundings u and v 172
