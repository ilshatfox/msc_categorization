decompositions according to the systems of binary compressions and shifts of a fixed function the convergence in l 2 of orthotorcurgery decompositions by the potachi systemam was proven kudryavtsymia v politov however the question of convergence remained open almost everywhere this work provides a general result of convergence almost everywhere of orthotorcursive decompositions for binary compression and shifts keywords orthotorcursive decomposition compression and shifts convergence almost everywhere orthorecursive decays introduced by t p lukashenko in 2000 2001 1 2 are a natural decomposition scheme generalizing the classic decomposition into the rows of fourier and included as an integral part into purely greedy decompositions and their generalizations 3 recall the definition of orthotorcursive decompositions let h the space with a scalar work in this work the case of spaces over the field of real numbers is considered en 1 the system of single elements h f element h we determine inductively the sequence of residues rn 0 and the sequence of the coefficients f n 1 r 0 f f n 1 rn en 1 rn 1 rn f n 1 en 1 definition a row n 1 f nen is called an orthorexide decomposition orthore by a curly row of fourier of the element f according to the system en mmn 1 it is easy to notice that the detachment of orthotorcurgery decomposition to the decomposed element is equivalent to the convergence of the residue of the decomposition to zero for orthotorcursive decompositions as for decompositions into the rows of fourier according to orthonomated systems the sequence of the coefficients f n 2 belongs to the 2 space and the equality of the parsheval 1 f 2 n f 2 is performed if only if it takes place the decay of decomposition to the decomposed element an interesting case of non targeted systems from the point of view of orthotorcursive decays is the systems of binary compression and shifts of fixed functions 100 materials of the international school conference 4 determine them by putting h l 2 0 1 let the ffic is an arbitrary function lying in l 2 0 1 and having a single l 2 norm dominate it with zero outside the segment 0 1 and put wor j x 2 k j x 2 k 2 accord 2 k x j k 0 1 2 j 0 j 0 j 0 j 0 1 2 k 1 the resulting system wor x n 1 which is normalized in l 2 0 1 is called a system of binary compression and shifts generated by the function x a yu kudryavtsev and a v politov 5 6 showed that if 1 0 onic x d 0 this condition is necessary for the completeness of the system onic x n 1 in l 2 0 1 and additional but additional a fairly weak condition has been fulfilled for the continuity of the generating function k 1 22 2 k mm where 2 is the integral continuity module in l 2 then for each element f l 2 0 1 its orthotorsky expansion of the expansion according to the system wor x 1 converges to f according to norm l 2 however for the functional spaces and in particular the l 2 spaces in the study of decompositions along with the question of convergence the question arises of the question of the convergence of almost everywhere for some systems first of all the system of characteristic functions of binary intervals and its generalizations such results were noted by the authors earlier 2 7 but it turns out that convergence is almost everywhere a common property in ortorkursive decomposition of the continuous function of the function in a wide class of systems of binary compression and shifts more specifically the following theorem takes place let the function onic x which generates the system of binary compression and shifts is non negative on the segment 0 1 and satisfies the condition or the condition of the h lder with an arbitrary positive indicator on this segment and the function f l 2 0 1 is almost continuous everywhere then the orthotorcursive decomposition of the function f x according to the system of binary compression and shifts onic x urb 1 converges to f x almost everywhere on the segment 0 1 a key role in the proof of the theorem is played by lemma which is essentially associated with the consideration of the local from the point of view of the segment 0 1 the property of the decomposition coefficients this lemma can be formulated as follows for the binary irrational point x and the whole non negative k through nk x we denote this natural number n 2 k j j 0 1 2 k 1 which x j 2 k j 1 2 k in other words nk x is the index of the binary segment of the k th pack containing point x v v galatenko t p lukashenko v a sadovnichy 101 lemma row k 0 f 2 nk x 2 k converges for almost all x 0 1 it seems that the above theorem allows further generalizations related to the weakening of conditions as a generating function onic in particular this refers to the refusal of the requirement of the pitch as well as the weakening of the condition of h lderovo
