the direction of the initial growth of the crack from the top of the casp with a semi infinite neckline v v ermolaeva l v sinyushin for aza certain states enoye univa sit the task of finding the direction of the beginning 1 growth of cracks from the top of the caspa is solved on the basis of the hypothesis the initial spread of the treshine occurs in the plane for which normal tearing stresses ij 3 have 1 aximal value of the coefficient intensity 1 thus if z 0 is the top of the caspa and a c j ji z zoi z z 0 where 3 arg z z 0 then for determining the direction in 29 it is necessary to solve the equation rz iz zo lap c c o in s 1 uchas of the semi nerd cut the appearance of which is half a display of the upper half fringed im o using functions 2 i b 2 1 b 2 1 2 z i b 2 1 b 2 1 2 o 1 ish oh for pcqa definitions rz it comes down to solving the equation of the form a sin o in cos u s 3 u d cos 3 o f relative where a c c s d f are determined from the regional conjuring the first main task of the theory of elastic sty 2 for this the chi is in the plane with the specified neckline an exact decision was obtained determination 1 iv from the equation find 3 2 the task of determining the direction of crack growth is solved for the case of setting the boundary voltage in the form of w n it t e o oo w e o 21 r t i and for the case of the application of concentrated force at one boundary point which corresponds to the rupture of the first kind in the vector of boundary efforts literature 1 panasyuk v v the marginal balance of fragile bodies with crack kyiv naukova dumka 1968 264 p 2 muskhelishvili i i some of the main backdrop and mathema of the thusecoral theory of elasticity m science 1966 707 p thirty
