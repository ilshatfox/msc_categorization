extremal functions in szego fekete problem ya v borisova the paper solves the szego and fekete problem by the variation method we investigate functionaldiferential equation for extremal function of the consedered functional for real values of the parameter extremal functions are found we describe the image domain under the extremal functions keywords functional holomorphic univalent function extremal function variational method udc 517 925 53 51 72 on the factorization of the characteristic polynomial of the matrix jacobi a v bratishchev 1 1 avbratishchev spark mail don state technical university let the autonomous system of differential equations of the nth order have an invariant set for a state of balance on this set we form a jacobi matrix of the right side of the system the work proposes a formulantactorization of this matrix the formula is useful in the task of designing regulators of dynamic systems key words autonomous system invariant set equilibrium state characteristic polynomial let the autonomous system of the nth order with right wing parts from the smoothness class c r r 0 74 materials of the school conference x 1 f 1 x 1 xn f 1 x x n fn x 1 xn fn x 1 as you know the function x is a full integral of the system 1 when and only when its derivative by virtue of the system 1 is identical to zero geometrically this means that every set of lc x x c c r is invariant the solution of the problem of koshi with the initial data x 0 x 01 x 0 n lc always lies on this set more general is the question when x is a private integral the set l x x 0 invariant it is relevant in the reverse tasks of the dynamics and synergistic theory of management 1 3 note that the reverse task of describing all differential equations for which this set is invariant was set in 4 this paragraph summarizes the presence of an invariant set in the system 1 lemma consider the n dimensional diversity l x 1 x 0 m x 0 m n 2 x r anti i x j x m let the functions 1 m and the right parts of the system 1 are connected by the ratios 1 x 1 f 1 x 1 xn fn x 1 1 x m x x 1 xn m x 1 f 1 x m xn fn x m 1 x m x x 1 xn where i 0 0 x 1 xn 0 i 1 m we denote through x t x 0 x 1 t x 0 xn t x 0 the solution of the problem for the system 1 with the initial condition x 0 x 0 x 0 let x 0 l and the corresponding generally speaking system of the system of differential equations 1 t 1 1 t m t x 1 t x 0 xn t x 0 m t m 1 t m t x 1 t x 0 xn t x 0 3 the task of the cat 1 0 m 0 0 has the only zero solution then l is an invariant set of system 1 proof it must be proved that x 0 l t 0 1 x 1 t x 0 xn t x 0 0 m x 1 t x 0 xn t x 0 0 a v bratishchev 75 denote i t i x 1 t x 0 xn t x 0 i 1 m then by force 1 3 we have 1 t 1 x 1 f 1 x t x 0 1 xn fn x t x 0 1 1 t m t x 1 t x 0 xn t x 0 m t m x 1 f 1 x t x 0 m xn fn x t x 0 m 1 t m t x 1 t x 0 xn t x 0 that is the functions i t are a solution to the system of differential equations 3 and with the initial condition i 0 i x 01 x 0 n 0 i 1 m due to the conditions of the uniqueness of the solution of this problem koshi receive the required ratio lemma proven consequence if the functions that determine the variety 2 and the right parts of the system 1 are connected by the private ratios of the type 1 x 1 f 1 x 1 xn fn x 1 1 m m x 1 f 1 x m xn fn x m 1 m where i 0 0 0 i 1 m then instead of 3 it is necessary to require the task of the cat 1 0 m 0 0 for the autonomous system 1 t 1 1 m m t m 1 m had the only zero solution let the autonomous system 1 have an invariant set 2 for which the conditions of lemma are fulfilled in the assumption of the analytics of the features of your in the vicinity of the beginning of the coordinates according to all variables from the condition i 0 0 x 1 xn 0 i 1 m there are equality i x 1 0 0 x 1 xn 0 i xn 0 0 x 1 xn 0 i 1 m 4 let the point x 0 x 01 x 01 l is the state of equilibrium of the system 1 and gor xi 1 1 xim m xi 1 m xim x x 0 0 then there is such a generalization of the theorem 2 of article 5 76 materials of the school conference of theorem the characteristic polynomial of the jacobi matrix of the right part 1 at the point x 0 l can be factorized by the following
