the new mke scheme for solving the flat task of the theory of elasticity of k m gladilshchikov nizhny novgorod state university gladilsh mail mail ru a number of numerical schemes for solving flat in the problems of the theory of elasticity are known they can be built on the basis of finite variational and characteristic methods or methods of final elements mke however the current mke schemes existing also have virtues and disadvantages 1 accordingly if the if it is obviously unsuccessful schemes the area of effective applicability of each scheme is limited therefore the problem of building new numerical schemes with improved properties continues to be relevant in this work a new approach is proposed to the construction of two dimensional schemes based on a three dimensional openwork scheme of mke 2 the construction of the scheme is considered on the example of a linear dyan of a mycual task of the theory of elasticity although it can be applied to other tasks of mathematical physics famous mke schemes suggest that the final elements occupy the estimated area all the time without the interval and without overlapping however the rejection of the requirement of continuous filling of the region with elements is also possible in the sense that the elements involved in the formation of the system of algebraic equations fill out the calculation of the fins with the intervals an example of a successful scheme of this kind when solving problems of the theory of shells is given in 3 this scheme showed advantages compared to the standard scheme on linear triangular elements 58 another example of an openwork scheme is proposed in 2 this is a hal solution of three dimensional problems on the basis of a linear final element in the form of a tetrahedron several methods are known for the structure of regular nets on tetrahedral cells with one of them the cell of the main grid parallelepiped is divided into 5 tetrahedron 1 in the center and 4 at the edges if you remove all the tetrahedron except for the central one we will get the desired mke scheme at the same time the division of the area into elements is as follows the region is divided into hexagons and even one of them remains one tetrahedron in each of them at the same time it turns out that not all nodes of a variable grid participate in the calculations but only nodes with an even amount of indices this scheme is completely symmetrical since the tetrahedron is located symmetrically relative to the center of the cube the scheme has on an orthogonal rhythmant grid the second procedure for proximation when solving dynamic problems on the obvious scheme or with an iteration solution of the system in an implicit scheme computational costs for one temporary layer one iteration for a given scheme are 2 to 5 times lower than for the traditional scheme on tetrahedrals or for a bilinear hexagonal ale cop in the case of using the obvious cross scheme this scheme is stable under the same conditions as the scheme of the bilinear final element we also note that the full template surroundings of the node of this scheme has the form of multifaceted nick which is significantly closer to the ball than a cube consequently sheer anisotropy should be lower than for example in the scheme of the hexagonal bilinear final element we will build a numerical solution to a two dimensional problem by designing a three dimensional scheme on a plane at the same time the h 3 the step of breaking the grid in the third coordinate is 59 in a parameter of a numerical scheme selected for consideration of stability and accuracy we write down the first two equations of the lama system while we will take into account the fact that we are considering a two dimensional task assessments of the temporary step of this two dimensional scheme can be obtained from the analysis of a three dimensional openwork scheme which is carried out by harmonica based on the spectral criterion for the stability of the neumann the condition of stability for the openwork scheme coincides with the condition of kunta where the minimum height is taken as a characteristic size or the minimum distance between the pairs of the crossed ribs of the tetraeral cell this scheme may also be characterized by the effect of boundary instability described in 2 with the corresponding selection of the h 3 parameter from this drawback you can trigger l and t r a t r a 1 golovanov a i tyuleneva o n shigabutdinov a f tod of the final elements in statics and the dynamics of thin constructions m fizatlit 2006 2 chekmarev d t openwork schemes of the final element method applied problems of strength and plasticity numerical modeling of physical and mechanical processes interuniversity sat m 1997 3 bazhenov v g chekmarev d t on the index switchgear of numerical differentiation j calculation mat and matte physical 1989 t 29 no 5 s 662 674 60
