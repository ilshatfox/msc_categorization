one class of axial symmetric solutions in the theory of gravity with the scalar field p e kashargin s v sushkov kazan state university serge sushkov ksu ru is devoted to the construction of axial symmetric rites in the framework of the general theory of relativity in the source of gravity in the form of a massless scalar field the action of the theory has the form s d 4 x g 1 8 r g 1 where r is the scalar curvature g metric tensor 1 the following equations of the gravitational and scalar fields correspond to the action 1 r 8 0 2 the solution of the system of equations 2 is built in a special class of axial symmetric meters 1 ds 2 f dt a cos dear 2 1 f dl 2 k d 2 sin 2 d accord where f k is the functions of one variable l and a parameter the solutions obtained in the work can be divided by three times personal algebraic classes by type of function k class a k l 2 l 20 l 0 6 0 f 2 0 l 0 be 0 u a 2 b 2 e 2 0 u u 20 4 16 121 where 0 l 0 b are the integration constants u u l arctg l l 0 and 1 class b k l 2 f 2 0 be 0 l a 2 b 2 e 2 0 l 0 l 16 here 1 class c k l 2 l 20 l 0 6 0 f 2 0 l 0 be 0 u a 2 b 2 e 2 0 u u 1 2 ln l 0 l l 0 the solution for the field in this case has different views in the visibility from the size u 4 20 16 1 u 20 4 16 1 the work was supported by the rffif project no 05 02 17344 l and t r a t r a 1 matos t nhangez d rotating scalar field wormhole preprint arxiv gr qc 0508117 122
