a study of the probability of successful placement of particles according to cells by the methods of complex analysis let the number of series of particles each series of sustainable particles n the number of cells in the equally cutting scheme for the placement of particles in cells we assume that events related to various series of particles are independent the chim is the probability of an event in each cell there was no more than p particles from one series the case of distinguishable particles in each series then pn 1 f 1 n n 1 p d 27 ri nmzm l c and fair 6 theorem 1 let p an then st pn echr a n 1 1 o n p n oo the case of indistinguishable particles in each series then m i z zp n n pn 2 ri f n t 1 n t 2 nzm l dz and fair theorem 2 1 let p 1 if p n oo so that n a y oo then pn e m m l o 2 let r 2 if p n n n n t oo is so that n s a a and oo then pn 1 the work is supported by the russian federation project 02 01 00168 yu r agachev m i zakiev a i leonov i p semenov kazan jagachev ksu ru direct method of solving one class of integrodiferent equations the linear integrated equation of the type x t 1 g t s x s ds la 1 h t s x s ds y t o t 1 1 where y t and g t s li t s are the known functions of the u 1 o l and o 1 2 respectively and x t the desired function denote through ch k t 0 fundamental joints shinn the howl of the degree on the net of nodes tk k o p let tk l 2 tk tk 1 2 and tu iv j o 1 sobolev s space with nor my jlxll llxlli 2 llx l designation h through w x b and a x b b 2 modules of continuity with step b function x t in space c o 1 and l 2 0 1 respectively and through w i h b 2 xss and wi h b 2 private modules continuity of the function h t s by variable t in spaces respectively l 2 0 1 x c o 1 and l 2 0 1 2 7 7
