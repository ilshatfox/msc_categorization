the fermat euler theorem and dynamical properties of p adic solenoids as is well known the theorems formulated below play an important role in the congruence theory see e g 1 fermat s theorem if a positive integer k is not divisible by a prime p then kp 1 1 mod p in 1760 l euler generalized this theorem to the following form euler s theorem let k and m be relatively prime positive integers then k m 1 mod m here m is the value of the euler function at m that is the number of positive integers which are relatively prime to m and at most m in 2 p fermat s theorem is applied to the study of properties of periodic points of limit mappings of the dyadic solenoid let p p 1 p 2 be an arbitrary sequence of prime numbers 1 not being included as a prime the p adic solenoid p is the inverse limit of the inverse sequence s 1 f 21 s 1 f 3 2 s 1 f 4 3 where s 1 is the unit circle considered as a subspace of the field of all complex numbers endowed with the natural topology for every integer n the bonding mapping fn 1 n is given by fn 1 n z z pn for each z s 1 if pn 2 for all integers n then the solenoid p is said to be dyadic recall that the solenoid p is a compact abelian group under the coordinatewise multiplication for positive integer k let the morphism hk p p be defined by hk g g k where g p a point g p is said to be periodic if g is a fixed point of the n th iteration of hk for some positive integer n using l euler s theorem one can prove cf 3 proposition 6 proposition suppose that infinitely many primes are not terms of the sequence p then the set of all periodic points of hk is dense in p r e f e r e n c e s 1 vinogradov i m the number theory basics moscow nauka 1981 176 p 2 charatonik j j covarrubias p p on covering mappings on solenoids 74 proc amer math soc 2002 no 130 p 2145 2154 3 gumerov r n on finite sheeted covering mappings onto solenoids proc amer math soc in press m ghadiri yazd iran mghadiri yazduni ac ir on direct limits of hv modules in this paper the category of hv modules is considered also it is shown that the direct limit of every direct system always exist in this category direct limit are defined by a universal property and so are unique the most powerful tool in order to obtain a module from a given hv module is the quotient out procedure by use this method some results about the connection between the fundamental modules direct systems and direct limits is proved by considering the fundamental equivalence relation b solon ivanovo russia solon icti ivanovo su quasi minimality is a synonym of the non totality of enumeration degree we use notations and terminology similar to those of the monograph 1 we recall as 2 that a e b a is enumeration reducible to b if there is a uniform algorithm for enumerating a given any enumeration of b formally a e b n x x a u x u wn du b let as usual a e b a e b b e a and de a b b e a be e degree of a and de a de b a e b denote by de the set of e degrees partially ordered by and by 0 e the least element of de an e degree a is called non total if in it there are no total functions which are identified with their graphs let tot be the set of all total e degrees the first example of a non total e degree has given by medvedev 3 the medvedev s e degrees were named by case 4 quasi minimal later a is quasiminimal iff 0 e a f tot f a f 0 e 75
