the qualitative investigation of a family of dynamic systems with polynomial right hand sides in the poincare disk i a andreeva a f andreev t o efimova some extended family of dynamical systems with polynomials in their right parts is studied on an arithmetical plane of the phase variables x and y d x d t x x y d y d t y x y here x x y y x y are reciprocal polynomials of x and y x is a cubic while y is a square form such that x 0 1 y 0 1 0 a goal was established to outline all possible topologically different phase portraits in the poincare circle existing for these systems with obtaining criteria of their appearance close to coefficient ones the poincare method of central and orthogonal displays is used the qualitative results together with the quantitative ones are given keywords dynamical system phase portrait poincare sphere poincare circle singular points trajectories udc 517 5 extremal sets in the complex plane chebotarev stahl and nuttall compacts a i aptekarev 1 1 aptekaa keldysh ru keldysh institute of applied mathematics russian academy of science moscow russian federation the classical chebotarev problem is about a compact of the minimal logarithmic capacity connecting a finite number of given points on the complex plane we discuss the modern applications and generalizations of this problem such as the sheets structure of the riemann surface of vector analytic functions and asymptotics of the hermite pad rational approximants 36 keywords chebotarev problem logarithmic capacity riemann surface hermite pad rational approximants 517 98 o 1 2 1 arzikulov 79 mail ru 2 yusup 62 mail ru h h c h 1 1 rd 1 d 1 n 2 rd 2 d 2 n h 0 k 0 x y h 0 f x y k 0 x y f x y k 0 x y 1 2 k 1 x s y 21 2 k 2 x t y 1 22 k 1 x s y k 1 s x y k 2 x t y k 2 x y t l 2 1 2 h h 0 t 1 t 2 1 t 1 t 2
