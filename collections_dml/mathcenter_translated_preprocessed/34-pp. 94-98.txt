building a solution to the gurs problem for the equation of liuville v i zhegalov a a kungurtsev let d 0 x a 0 y b task gursa find the function u x y c d c 1 1 d which is in d by the solution of the equation uxy k exp u k const 1 and satisfying the boundary conditions of u x 0 x x 0 a u 0 y y y 0 b 0 0 2 it is known 1 p 321 the general representation of the decision 1 first half obtained by liwill exp u 2 k x y onic x y 2 3 when constructing formula 3 the functions of ln accord x ln y ln 2 k are used therefore it should be assumed that k 0 x 0 y 0 4 96 in the rest ory are arbitrary functions put 0 0 0 5 for this can always be achieved by substituting u u 0 w x y u 0 0 0 6 obviously w satisfies the equation 1 with the multiplier keu 0 instead of k and yet taking into account the structure of the right part 3 and the pleasantness we put onic x 1 x 0 1 y 1 y 1 1 therefore we can and we will assume that wor 0 0 1 7 now we will look for a solution to the problem by substituting 3 b 2 i have exp x 2 k onic x 0 1 onic x 2 expp y 2 k 0 y 1 y 2 8 having integrated the first of these differential equalities we find ffic x 0 k x 0 exp d 0 k x 0 exp dran 9 by force 5 7 from 3 follows 0 0 2 k therefore 9 taking into account 4 rewrite onic x 2 onic 0 x 0 explode daw 2 0 x 0 exp dival 10 97 consciously calculate x 4 accord 0 exp x 2 0 x 0 exp daw 2 11 having put x 0 we have a ratio 0 0 which you are filled with any value onic 0 thus 0 is not determined from 11 so far we will still consider 0 an uncertain positive see 4 constant c a 10 commention live ivil x 2 c x 0 exp answers dran 2 c x 0 exp dran x 0 a 12 it is clear that the denominator should not contact zero it is indicated through f x we see that it is a function that decreases on 0 a i e to f x c exp x the condition of the circulation f x in zero is c x 0 exp answers d 2 therefore to a status condition for the unreason f x in zero on 0 a is the execution of inequality c 2 a 0 exp cil dival 13 similarly having solved the second equation 8 relatively y we get y 2 c 1 y 0 exp d 2 c 1 y 0 exp d y 0 b 14 with a positive constant c 1 satisfying the condition c 1 2 b 0 exp d 15 98 is not difficult to see see 11 and a similar formula for y that requirements 4 are fulfilled by substituting 12 14 b 3 after obvious transformations we find exp u x y 8 cc 1 exp x y k 4 cc 1 x 0 exp ddition y 0 exp d 2 16 having put here x 0 y 0 we have cc 1 2 k by force 13 15 the boundary conditions 2 must satisfy the inequality k a 0 exp daw b 0 exp d 2 17 a formula 16 at cc 1 2 k obviously it acquires the type of exp u x y 4 exp x y 2 k x 0 explode daw y 0 explinatory d 2 18 this is the desired solution of the problem from the above reason the unity of this decision follows thus to the cauldron of the theorem if on the segments of your definition x y c and the condition 17 is fulfilled then the solution of the problem 1 is only given by the formula 18 note that for a more general equation uxy f x y u ux uy the correctness of the gurs problem is proved by the method of sequential approaches 2 p 205 99 l and t r a t r a 1 bitsadze a v equations of mathematical physics m nauka 1982 336 p 2 three part of f lectures on equations in private production m il 1957 443 p about one mixed task for the potential of the electric field a a zhidkov nizhny novgorod state university named after n i lobachevsky artem zhidkov telma ru a wide class of physical tasks leads to the study of electromagnetic fields in quasi stationary electric approximation in particular such tasks arise when dividing electromagnetic processes in the atmosphere 1 in the approximation under consideration the maxwell equation system has the form of rot h x t 4 c j x t 1 c d x t t rot e x t 0 div b x t 0 div d x t 4 x t and material ratios are performed see 2 j x t x e x t ect x t b x t x h x t d x t x e x t the solution is sought in the area t x t x r 3 t 0 t it is assumed that the area r 3 is a homeomorph is 100
