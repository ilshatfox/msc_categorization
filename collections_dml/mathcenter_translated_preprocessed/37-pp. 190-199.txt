determination of heterogeneity in flat waves by neural networks fig a waveguide with a metal screen has a flat waveguide which is a dielectric with metal walls x 0 and x h see fig the environment is supposed to be homogeneous and isotropic in the waveguide there is heterogeneity in the form of a flat perfect screen set by three numbers d the task of finding such heterogeneity is set in some part of the waveguide 0 d d d d for the solution of which the neural network is used signals are generated a a 1 a 2 emitting a certain source the corresponding reflected signal 191 a a 1 a 2 is recorded by a sensor the function f a a d is required in order to determine the position of the heterogeneity set by the numbers d by a pair of signals suppose that numbers d and signal a are known put the recalling so called the direct task of finding the reflected signal a in the general case this task reduces the infinite system of linear algebraic equations bslau h 2 a ke i kd n 0 ane nd 1 n k ink n 0 ane imbes k 0 where is ink x onic x dx ink are calculated in the closed form n k 2 n h 2 n 6 0 n 0 and k the number characterizes the signal distribution environment in 2 it is proven that this blanch can be solved by truncation in practice it will be possible to measure only the final number of signal coordinates a and a and blanca will become an ordinary sludge which can be solved by any suitable numerical method let now we have some final set of given a k a k k k d k korn k n after solving n direct problems the initial task is reduced to the construction of such a fw function that the minimum of the following functionality is achieved w k organ k k d k fw a a a a a k a k 2 min where x y z 2 x 2 y 2 z 2 the fw function is searched in a certain form set by the so called architecture of the neural network this work uses a multi layer perceptron 192 thus the task is to select the coefficients w w 1 wm on which the desired minimum is achieved the selection is implemented using the so called method of reverse distribution of error 3 l and t r a t r a 1 pleshchinsky b models and methods of wave electrodynamics uch manual kazan ksu 2008 104 p 2 pleshchinsky b tumakov n n partial areas for scalar coordinate tasks of the diffraction of electromagnetic waves in classes of generalized functions kazan ksu 2000 50 p 3 hyikins neural networks full course 2 nd ed excavated m publishing house of williams 2006 1104 p t t yusupov nizhny novgorod state university named after n i lobachevsky tty list ru category pseudo psyche with a non aable structural group consider the smooth main stratification lection with the projection p e b and the structural group g on the basis of the stratification we set the right action r b b the final group determination 1 let u an open coating of diversity b for which there is an atlas a u of stratification and r u u for all u u then the u is called cil cover 193 determination 2 let u cil prolling the base b and u u and eu p 1 u action ru eu e we call the local raising of the action r to the space of the stratification lection if p rru r p for all and r u v g r u v g for all v for all v eu g g at the same time the set r ru u u we will call the pseudo treading of r determination 3 let them pcing u atlas a u stratification iron and pseudo pseudo ru u u a action r if the e exists g ligature invariant relative to r then pair a u r will be called pseudo atlas the two pseudo atlas will be considered equivalent if many g bonds invariant relative to the corresponding pseudo release coincide if a is the equivalence class of the pseudo atlas a u r then the pair a will be called pseudo psyche by virtue of this definition if the g ligature of the invariant relative to some pseudo atlas pseudo spray then it is an invariant regarding all its pseudo athlas thus with each pseudo spray is associated with many invariant g binding h let f e e morphism over b of the main strata e p b g and e p b g then f is isomorphism and induces the bijection f of the many g bonds of the stratification lection into many g bonds of the stratification let us now consider the pseudo psyche a and a determination 4 if f h h then we will call fraphism the pseudo psyche and we will consider the variety of b group g and action r b b then the many pseudo 194 strata over b with the structural group g and their morphisms form the category k b g r denote the symbol n b r group of invariant
