frames of parseval in rn with the same norms of m a lapshin samara university marijalapshina rambler ru a set of vectors f mi 1 rn is called the frame parseval if each f rn is fairly equal to m i 1 f fi 2 f 2 if f 1 f 2 fm then fi 2 n m frames of parseval with the same norms are of great interest for applied research it is known 1 that for each m n there is a framework of parseval with the same norms however building such frames requires complex algorithm movs the work shows simple ways to build a parseval frames with the same norms for the next pairs m 3 n 2 m 4 n 2 m 5 n 2 n 3 n 4 m 6 n 3 in the proposed algorithms matrices of the dysflow of fourier are used 2 l and t r a t r a 1 casazza p g modern tools for weyl heisenberg gabor frame theory advances in imaging and electron physics 2000 v 115 p 1 127 2 christensen o an introduction to frames and riesz bases birkhauser boston 2003 153
