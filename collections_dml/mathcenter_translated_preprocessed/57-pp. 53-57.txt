integral formulas when finding the temperature distribution in the prince of sudden heating of the surface of a non uniform half space v b bednova this article presents the solution method of the temprature problem of the sudden heating of the depth half space surface we use integral formulas that allow us to obtain the solution of the original problem for an equation with variable coefficients depending on coordinates and time by solving the same problem for an equation with constant coefficients keywords heat conduction partial differential equations with variable coefficents integral formulas udc 517 929 a new approach in the existence of periodic solutions for the functional radical equations of the point type l a beklarian 1 a l beklarian 2 1 lbeklaryan outlook com central economic and mathematics institute of the russian academy of sciences moscow 2 abeklaryan hse ru national research university higher school of economics moscow report is dedicated to the functional and differential equations of the childertip t f t x q 1 t x qs t t br where f where f where f where f where f where f r rns rn display of class c 0 q j j 1 s straight homeomorphisms preserving orientation br closed interval t 0 t 1 closed numerical half rectifier t 0 or numerical direct r keywords functional radical equations of a point type initial stringular problem solitone solutions periodic solutions the importance of the equations of the type under consideration is determined by the fact that the theory of solutions of the functional dispersed equations of the point type is closely connected with the theory of solutonic solutions for endlessly ordinary differential equations 2 the approach proposed for the study of such equations is based on formalism the central element of which is constructions that use of course the generated group q q 1 q s 54 materials of the school conference of homeomorphisms of direct group operation in such a group is superposition of homeomorphisms using the replacement of time for the functions of the rejection of the argument q j t t j 1 s can always achieve the fulfillment of the condition h max iorn 1 s h j ger h j sup tgr q j t t j 1 s the main goal in the study of the functional differential equations of the point type is the study of the initial stringly task t f t x q 1 t x qs t t br 1 t onic t t r br linger r rn 2 x t x t r x rn 3 which we will call the main initial stringent task in a situation of the general position when t t 0 t 1 or the deviations of the argument are arbitrary we have a task with non cutting initial root conditions another important class of tasks is associated with the study of periodic and limited solutions for the initial functional differential equation of a type of type determined on a straight line we determine the bananah space of functions x with libra l n c k r x x c k r r r r r r r r r r rn max 0 r k sup tgr x t t rn 0 1 and the norm x k max 0 r k sup tgr x t t rn we formulate a system of restrictions on the right part of the functional differential equations of the point type a f c 0 r rn s rn in condition a function f according to a variable t you can put a piece of line with the first kind of ruptures at the points of a discrete set b condition of quasilineous growth for any t z j z j j 1 s f t z 1 zs rn m 0 t m 1 s j 1 z j rn m 0 c 0 r r and r and condition of the lipper f t z 1 zs f t z 1 z s rn m 2 s j 1 z j z j rn actually m 1 m 2 but the constants m 1 and m 2 can be taken equal l a beklarian a l beklard 55 c exists r such that expression sup ipo m 0 t i i for any t r it has the final value and as the function of the argument t is continuous theorem 1 1 if for some 0 0 1 the inequality m 2 s j 1 h j ln 1 then with any fixed initial stringed conditions x rn lux r rn there is a solution absolutely continuous x l n c 0 r the main initial stringular task 1 3 such a solution is the only one as the element of the space n c 0 r continuously depends on the initial string conditions onic linger x rn and the right part of the equation function f periodic solutions of the equation t f t x t n 1 x t ns t r 4 the right part of which periodic in time with the period without violating the community we will assume that n 1 ns for clarity when presented we limit ourselves to the case when the values of the deviations of the argument n 1 ns and the period of the right side of the equation by a variable time are comparable in this case without violating the community we can assume that the values of n 1 ns are integer the last property can be achieved by replacing time of the type of stretching cf
