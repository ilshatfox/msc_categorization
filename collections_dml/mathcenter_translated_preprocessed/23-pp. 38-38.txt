hypothesis of additivity in the quantum theory of information in the quantum theory of information that are simply formulated but still not amenable to solution concerns the additivity of a number of characteristics of the quantum communication channel of the type of classical throughput or maximum purity of the output state in relation to the operation of the tender channel works this question is closely related to the purely mathematical problem of multiplier s multiplier quite positive display describing the channel all known results including a numerical audit are in accordance with this hypothesis a positive solution to this problem would mean in particular that the use of adherent states does not increase classical throughput and would be important for quantum information theory the report gives a formulation of a number of additivity multiplicity problems the relationship between them is investigated and the proof of partial results confirming the hypothesis is discussed 40
