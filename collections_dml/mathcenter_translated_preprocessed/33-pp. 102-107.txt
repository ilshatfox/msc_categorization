the reverse task of assimilating the data of the method of the lying drops of e v volkov rnc kurchatov institute moscow introduction the method of the lying drop is one of the main and most reliable static methods for measuring the surface tension of high temperature melts 1 2 in this method a drop is placed on a solid horizontal unmarked or poorly wetted substrate to calculate surface tension a drop is photographed and its characteristic dimensions are measured in the picture it is assumed that the surface of the drop has a symmetry of rotation the results of the experiment of the lying drops were historically processed manually based on the use of bashfort and adams tables and geometric constructions however this method requires an individual approach to each individual picture time costs and although it is quite accurate still leaves opportunities for a more accurate solution in this regard at present special attention is paid to the use of modern personal computers for processing experimental data there are a number of computer programs for processing data obtained by the method of lying a drop for example 3 at the same time existing programs are inaccessible or expensive and the question of their reliability remains open in this paper a description of the developed computer processing of the data of the lying drop method is given and the results of the computational experiment are given to determine the reliability of the restoration of the capillary permanent 102 e v volkova 1 mathematical model the main equation of the method of the lying drop the equation of jung laplace describing the surface of a drop with a symmetry of rotation in the form of a dependence of y x a drop of drops on height x above the substrate has the form y 1 y 2 3 2 1 y 1 y 2 1 2 h x 2 2 r 0 1 1 where h is the height of the drop above the substrate r 0 is the radius of the curvature of the drops at the upper point 2 1 2 g capillary constant surface tension 1 2 density of media inside and outside the drop g acceleration of free fall to find the solution of the equation 1 1 natural parameterization of the curve y x x t y t is introduced where t is the length of the curve from the top of the drop such parameterization leads to the system of equations 3 x 2 y 2 r 0 h x 2 y 2 r 0 1 2 with the initial conditions x 0 h y 0 0 0 1 and an additional condition y t 0 1 r 0 to find surface tension it is necessary to solve the reverse task of restoring the coefficients r 0 h and 2 for the set of observation values xi yi i 1 n the values of the density parameters and the acceleration of free fall are considered known in addition it is believed that the height of the drop h is known from observation data thus the reverse problem is solved relative to two parameters r 0 and 2 which change within some intervals of permissible values r 0 min r 0 max and 2 min 2 max respectively 2 solution to solve a direct problem 1 2 used the runge kutta method of the fourth order of accuracy 4 an example of a solution 103 the reverse task of assimilating the data of the laying drop of a direct task is shown in fig 1 fig 1 solving the direct problem of the method of lying drops the reverse problem of restoring the coefficients of the system of equations 1 2 is incorrect to solve it the variational method of regolarization of tikhonov 5 with the smoothing functionality of the type j 2 r 0 n i 1 yi yi modi 2 a r 02 2 2 min 2 r 0 2 1 2 2 min 2 max r 0 r 0 min r 0 max where yi is the value of the observed radius modi is the corresponding the same height xi modeling radius of the drop a 0 is a regulatory parameter the choice of which will be discussed below for several calculated examples the smoothing functionality 2 1 turned out to be not unymodal therefore the genetic algorithm 6 with the following launch parameters was used to minimize it sampling 4095 points the number of individuals in population 20 the number of iterations 6 100 the number of solutions of the direct problem 4000 the time of work on the pentium iv 2 53 ghz 3 min 104 e v volkova 3 computing experiment to verify the reliability of the restoration of capillary constant at different levels of error in the observation data a computational experiment was conducted to assign the observation data the solution of the direct problem with the parameters h 0 253 r 0 0 27 2 0 034934 n 40 a random disturbance was included the total value of which was 2 n i 1 2 xi x i where 2 xi x i is the distance between the unperturbed and corresponding indignant points after finding the minimum of the function 2 1 the relative error ref 2 mod 2 2 was evaluated as well as the solution of the solution the norm of the difference between the observation data and the solution of the direct problem with the found value of the 2 mod parameter some results of the computational experiment are given in table 1 p
