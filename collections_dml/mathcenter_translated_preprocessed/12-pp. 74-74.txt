the interaction of jets with permeable obstacles of p r andronov research institute of mechanics of the moscow state university sh m v lomonosova l 1 oskva e ta 1 andrrm imr hamrmr c ms 11 r 11 r of various gas cutting technologies for example in the drying technology of humid fabric with a directed stream of air there are a task of flowing through permeable surfaces solving the corresponding problems can only be obtained by nri of certain assumptions about the properties of a permeable surface in this paper an anus received an annetic solution by the methods of tfkp the problem of the interaction of a hundred zyonary free jet of an ideal non disintegrated liquid stirring from the canal with a permeable screen under conditions that the sucking rate is linearly depending on the pressure difference and that the fluid velocity after leaking is directed 110 normal to surfaces it is shown that behind the sketching of a degenerate case of absolute permeability along with seeping unlimited spreading of the jet in front of the barrier is always originating also in this work a numerical solution was obtained by the non tedious problem of the interaction of a flooded flat stream with a penny of the red width plate the method of discrete vortices was used it was assumed that the law of seeping is linear and that the speed beyond the plate is not necessarily directed by normal to it the influence of the guide action of the structure of the porosity of the plate on the picture of the current was investigated the work was carried out with partial financing under the program of the rff for supporting leading scientific schools project 00 15 96070 74
