geometrical properties of sun i g tsarkov in the article there solved two long running question it is obtained the characterization of a bounded compact set to be a sun via the property of acyclicity of the sets of the best approximation and also it is proved that any bounded compact set possessess a continuous selection for all 0 the solution of the second problem on b connection of a bounded sun is obtained as a corollary from the solution of the first problem keywords geometrical theory approximation sun kolmogorov criterion udc 517 952 the smoothness of the decisions of the heterogeneous system of duglisov o v chernova 1 1 chernova olga bsu edu ru the belgorod state national research university the institute of engineering and digital technologies in the article for the first order elliptical system with comprehensive coefficients considers the task of riman gilbert under certain conditions the smoothness of the solution of the heterogeneous daglis system is proved on the right side of the regional condition key words riman gilbert s task elliptical system index let the area d of the complex plane c is limited by the smooth contour c 1 the latter condition means that the derivative of parameterization of the smooth curve belongs to the class of the helder ca with indicator 0 1 recall that the function gment satisfies the condition of the helder with the indicator 0 1 on a certain set of the complex plane if it exists such constant c 0 that z 1 arent z 2 c z 1 z 2 for any z 1 z 2 e the smallest constant c in this assessment coincides with the midnight sup z 1 z 2 onic z 1 arent z 2 z 1 z 2 374 materials of the school conference where the upper line is taken according to the points z j e the class of limited functions that satisfy this condition is indicated by c e regarding the norm onic sup e onic z ip it is a banach space 1 if e is a closed area d then you can introduce the space c 1 d continuously differentiated in d functions which together with their private derivatives belong c d consider in the area d the heterogeneous system of the daglis lj z a z z b z z f z z d 1 where the differential operator l j y j x acts in the class l vector functions and is determined by the constant matrix j cl l its own values which lie in the upper half frost im 0 and l l matrix coefficients a z b z and f z belong to the class c d the corresponding homogeneous system l jy 0 in the assumption that the matrix j teplitsev was first studied by a duglis 1 in the framework of the so called hypercomplex numbers later the first order elliptical systems with constant coefficients were examined by b boyarsky 2 r p gilbert j l buchanan 3 and many other authors for the system 1 we set the task of rieman gilbert with the next regional condition reg t t f t t 2 where l l matrix functions g t c and its definition are everywhere different from zero in the work 4 it was shown that in the class c j d c d c 1 d l jart c d the task 1 2 fredgolmova and its index is given by the formula 1 argdetg l 3 where the increment is taken in the direction leaving the region d on the left theorem if f c 1 d then any solution c j d the problem of rimanagilbert 1 2 belongs to the class c 1 d and therefore the index formula 3 retains its strength and in class c 1 d the work was carried out with financial support from the ministry of education and science of the russian federation project no 1 7311 2017 8 9 literature 1 soldatov a p singular integral operators and elliptical regional tasks i smfn 2017 t 63 no 1 s 1 189 2 douglis a a function theoretic approach to elliptic systems of equations in two variables comm on pure and appl math 1953 v 6 p 259 289 i a shakirov 375 3 boyarsky b v theory of a generalized analytical vector annales polon math 1966 v 17 no 3 p 281 320 4 gilbert r p buchanan j l first order elliptic systems a function theoretic approach mathematics in science and engineering 163 academic press inc orlando fl 1983 281 p smoothness of solutions for non homogeneous douglis system o v chernova we consider the riemann hilbert problem for an elliptic system of first order under certain conditions on the right hand side of the boundary condition the smoothness of solution for the non homogened doulis system is studied keywords riemann hilbert problem elliptic system index udc 517 518 83 on the best approximation of the constant loader operator fourier i a shakirov 1 1 iskander tatngpi ru naberezhnye chelninsky state pedagogical university corresponding to the classic operator fourier of the constant of the lebaga is approached by logarithmic functions depending on two parameters the element of the best uniform approximation the value of the best approximation and the algorithm of the sequential reduction of its initial value are indicated key
