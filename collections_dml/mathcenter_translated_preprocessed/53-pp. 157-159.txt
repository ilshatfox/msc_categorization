problems of the centralization of the internet of things and their solutions to the internet of things iv are an environment in which unique identifiers are assigned different objects including animals and people and the possibility of transmitting data through the network without the requirement of a man man or a person a person computer see for example 1 to create iv networks it is necessary to solve a number of problems whose operation is determining the rules for providing access to data sensors and control rights of control funds devices determining the rules for registering but devices on the iv network etc these tasks these tasks as a rule they are in the local means of companies etc due to limited access to the created technologies organizing an intranet instead of the internet of things 2 even taking into account the unifying standards of the consortass of the mind a iot 3 modern created protocols such as a pitch are guided by the presence of some user management services on the network 4 the general collection and processing of possible problems in the network excessive loads on similar vital services to increase the failure tolerance of iv networks their decentralization is necessary the translation of computing loads to the network of devices itself foggy calculations 5 as well as the introduction of the protocols of the reinforcement authentication authorization and identification of devices based on the solutions of the internet agents themselves 158 a a feranets of things as the basis for the proposed protocols the ideas of the security system alljoyn security 2 0 6 with various types of access control lists acl are taken 7 8 to abandon the single service of security manager offered in the framework a description of trust levels is used a thin access system is introduced to individual components from the outside of roles the system determines the main torture of actions related to the security system and the categories of typical actions related to the main functionality based on the categorizes described above algebra of decisions of the iv network agents was introduced which allows you to abandon the centralized approach or reduce the influence of central services in the ev networks due to the flexible approach in the description of the decision of decisions compatibility with existing security organization systems is possible the work was carried out with the financial support of the russian federation and the government of the republic of tatarstan project no 15 47 02472 l and t r a t r a 1 what is internet of things iot definition from whats com electronic resource url http internet offingsagenda techtarget com definition internet off things iot 2 carsten magerkurth convertered architectural reference model for the iot v 2 0 3 documents iot a internet of things architecture electronic resource url http www iot a eu public public documbs doocements 1 4 alljoyn iot framework updated with enhanced security functionly electronic resource url https allseenalliance n m firstova e a schepakina 159 org announcement alljoyn freek updated lehanced security freewear 5 distefano s merlino g puliafito a atility paradigm for iot the sensing cloud persive and mobile computing 2015 t 20 c 127 144 6 alljoyn security 2 0 feature high level design electric thrine url https allseenalliance org framework documentation learn security 2 0 hld 7 seitz l slander g geehrmann c authorization framework for the internet of things world of wireless mobile and multimedia networks wowmom 2013 t 14 c 1 6 8 godik s anderson a parducci b humenn p oasis extensible access control markup language xacml 3 techno report oasis 2002 n m firstova e a schepakina samara national research university named after academician s p queen firstova natalia yandex ru shchepakina yahoo com method of integral diversity in modeling critical phenomena in the tasks of chemical kinetics is devoted to the problems of modeling and research of critical phenomena in the tasks of chemical kinetics based on a geometric approach when modeling and studying objects and processes of various nature the nature of which is the ability to simultaneously
