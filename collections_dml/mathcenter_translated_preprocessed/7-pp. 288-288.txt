mathematical modeling of the problem of the flow of fluid to the well which revealed the multi layer layer m n verev azerbaijani state research and design institute of the oil industry aznipineft 370033 baku ul aga neimatullah 39 the movement of fluid in a horizontal large enough layer consisting of an arbitrary number of ladies with various thicknesses and penetration coefficients and peozo conductivity is considered the mathematically set problem is solved using integrated transformations of laplace and hankel in the established and not established filtering modes due to the fact that with a large number of layers of the layer an accurate transition from images of the applied transformations to the originals in the sense of obtaining effective formulas is almost impossible in the work it is designed with a close but accurately accurate method for the transmission to the originals the considered problem is first solved for a specific number of layers of the layer on the basis of which the existing analogy between the number of layers the boundary conditions and parameters of the formation is revealed according to an analogy the task is generalized in case of an arbitrary number of layers of the layer due to the fact that with a large number of layers of the layer more than three checking the calculations according to the exact formulas is time consuming an effective method has been developed which allows a sufficient degree of accuracy to conduct hydrodynamic calculations 288
