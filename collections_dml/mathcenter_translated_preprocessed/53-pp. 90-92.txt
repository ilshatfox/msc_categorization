the use of artificial neural networks to analyze the visual analyzer studies the work of the visual analyzer by means of outbreak of visual caused potential sasp the schedule of which is shocked in fig 1 fig 1 the sils of sils s v makletsov 91 certain reactions of various areas of the brain on the floor on the floor of tea visual information may be the basis for nominating assumptions about its normal functioning or the presence of certain deviations from the norm to solve the problem of determining the qualitative paramet of the ditch of the visual analyzer personal approaches and in particular models built on the basis of artificial neural networks ins can be used 1 on the basis of the scientific and diagnostic center at the kazan state medical university experiments were conducted on the creation of artificial neural network fashion lee type perceptron with the use of one of the most diverse learning algorithm the error algorithm in the first experiment a sample of 85 people divided into 7 groups was used as a training set the first group 24 people was conditionally assigned to the norm and the rest included persons with certain deviations from the norm the accuracy of the perceptron in the test sample when providing new data was not 50 which does not allow using such a network in real conditions in the course of the second experiment the neural network was the wife of a training sample of the same volume divided into only 3 groups at the same time the quality of the classification increased to 70 as a result ways to improve the quality of the ins were proposed firstly since the neural network contains a pain number of relationships between neurons and corresponded a large number of customizable parameters su 92 e galkovo an increase in the sample for its training is required secondly when creating an as it makes sense to replace the measured input indicators with the calculated values depending on the medium normal indicators thirdly a neural network should be divided through functional blocks into several related networks the work of which will analyze the corresponding stages of processing of visual information with the brain this will reduce the number of relationships on the network and use the teaching samples of a smaller size when maintaining the statical level of quality classification of patients in addition this approach will allow to obtain a more accurate representation about the work of various departments of the visual analyzer l and t r a t r a 1 yahyuevag fundamentals of the theory of neural networks electronic resource national open university intuit url http www intuit ru studies courses 88 lecture 20527 e g malkovich novosibirsk state university malkovich math nsc ru about einstein metrics with two functional parameters consider the four dimensional rimanov metric of the type g dt 2 a 21 e 1 2 a 22 t e 2 2 e 3 2 where 1 forms ei form the base of the algebra su 2 as is known
