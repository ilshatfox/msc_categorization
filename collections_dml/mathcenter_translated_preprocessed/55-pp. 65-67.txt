sufficient conditions for the completeness of the exponential system in convex areas a f kuzhaev 1 1 arsenkuzh outlook com bashkir state university provides sufficient conditions for the completeness of the system of exponential monomas in convex areas this result is a generalization of the classical statement obtained independently by a f leontyev and b ya levin in case of indicators that do not have a density it was found that weakening the measurability of the sequence that is the existence of density in the context of the above result of completeness is the equality of the upper and maximum densities key words sequence density whole function completeness convex region let k nk ger 1 a multiple sequence of positive numbers here k k 1 is an unlimited strictly increasing sequence of sexual numbers and nk is a natural number called the multiplicity of the element k k n recall that the upper density and maximum density respectively is the following characteristics of the sequence n lim t nder 1 t k t nk n 0 lim 0 lim t 1 t t 1 af k t nk according to 1 e 3 ch iv the limit for 0 always exists so the maximum density is determined correctly in the case of the limit n lim t 1 t k t nk the sequence is called measurable and this limit is simply density if the sequence is measurable then the upper and maximum density for it coat and equal density 2 lemma 2 1 we will be interested in the case when the upper and maximum density coincide but the sequence is not measurable many such sequences are non notorious that it demonstrates the following example let 0 rk and rk 1 rk k urb we put k organo where k is a lot consisting of all natural numbers belonging to the interval r 2 k r 2 k 1 k n the frequency of each of which is equal to one we put for brevity n t k t nk 66 materials of the youth school conference due to the choice of numbers rk we have n lim t ger n t t lim k ger n r 2 k 1 r 2 k 1 lim k r 2 k 1 r 2 k r 2 k 1 1 let 0 1 denote n 0 lim t n t n t 1 t then n 0 lim k n r 2 k 1 n r 2 k 1 1 af r 2 k 1 lim k r 2 k 1 r 2 k 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 from here taking into account the previous one according to 3 lemma 1 we get n 0 n at the same time we have lim t n t t lim k n r 2 k r 2 k lim k r 2 k 1 r 2 k 0 thus the sequence does not have a density let the producing convex area of complex plate the vertical diameter of the region will be called the following value d g sup x sup z 1 z 2 g y 1 y 2 z 1 x i y 1 z 2 x i y 2 z 1 z 2 g x r through kg we will denote the supporting function of the convex region g 4 p 43 we put e zl e k z nk 1 k 1 l 0 we will say that the system of functions e pop on in the convex region g if it is full in the space of functions that analytical in the region with the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsurrents of isg the next statement is generalized by the classic result of levinaleontiev which was obtained by them independently of each other 5 p 286 4 p 122 theorem let n n 0 mm then the system is full in any area g for which the condition kg 2 kg 2 d g 2 is met and is incomplete in any area with a vertical diameter d g 2 literature 1 koossis p the logarithmic integral i cambridge university press 1997 625 p 2 abdulnagimova i krivosheev c correctly distributed subset in the complex plane algebra and analysis 2016 t 28 no 4 s 1 46 3 krivosheev s kuzhaeva f about one theorem of leontyev levin ufa matte g 2017 t 9 no 3 c 89 101 4 leontyeva f whole functions rows exhibited m nauka 1983 176 p o i kuznetsova 67 5 levinb i distribution of roots of whole functions m gittl 1956 632 c on sufficient conditions of the completeness of exponelas systems in convex domains a f kuzhaev we give some sufficient conditions for the completens of the system of exponential monomials in convex domains this result is a generalization of a classical proposition on completones of exponential monomials systems with positive exponents in a convex domain when these exponens have not devsity the proposition was obtained by a leonties and b levin independently it is ovehed that of the condition of sequence s measurability i e existence of its density can be replaced by the condition of its upper and maximumuum densitities keywords density of sequence entire function completens convex domain udc 519 62 the structure of the global attorrator of the generalized system of chua o i kuznetsova 1 1 oxxy 4893 mail ru tula state university institute
