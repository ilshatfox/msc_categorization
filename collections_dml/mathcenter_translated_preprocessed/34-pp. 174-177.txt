refined resonances in the system of two weakly tied nonlinear oscillators a v potapov nizhny novgorod state university named after n i lobachevsky consider the system of two weakly tied nonlinear os of the cyllets 1 x 1 1 x 2 1 x 3 1 x 2 1 2 x 2 2 x 2 x 3 2 x 1 1 176 which is which which in the transition to the altitude action contribution the type 1 x 2 i 2 2 1 i 1 x 1 1 i 1 1 x 1 1 1 1 2 x 1 i 1 1 1 i 1 1 1 will take 1 x 2 2 i 2 2 1 1 i 1 x 2 i 2 2 1 i 1 x 1 11 1 x 1 iod i 1 1 2 2 i 2 x 1 i 1 1 x 2 i 2 i 2 2 2 where slow variables i 1 and i 2 are changed in some naughty limited area r 2 1 2 mod 2 fast angular variables running two dimensional tor t 2 1 i 1 2 i 2 frequencies of unrelated oscillators determination 1 we will say that in the system 1 there is a resonance p q if the condition of the frequency rhinosity is fulfilled 1 i 1 2 i 2 q p q expression 1 i 1 2 i 2 q p is determined on the plane i 1 i 2 a resonance curve we select the point on it i 1 pq i 2 pq determination 2 we will say that in the system 2 at the point i 1 pq i 2 pq there is a degraded resonance of the first order if the condition 1 i 1 pq 2 i 2 pq 0 is fulfilled at this point and at least one of the second derivatives from the personal from zero periods h 1 2 traffic along a closed phase curve 21 2 2 x 2 1 2 2 1 2 x 3 1 2 3 x 4 1 2 4 h 1 2 uninocked oscillators 0 are non monotonons of functions at 1 2 0 2 in this case in the system 2 degenerated resonances of the 1 st order may exist periodic solutions of the unperturbed system 0 are expressed through elliptical functions in the work 1 it was shown that in the case of the degree of the 1 st along the row in the vicinity of the degenerate resonance system 2 from 177 accuracy to members of the order o it can be led to the type u 1 2 3 a 10 i 1 pq i 2 pq u 2 2 3 a 20 i 1 pq i 2 pq 2 3 1 2 u 21 2 1 2 32 u 22 3 where a 10 ship 1 2 p 2 p 0 x 2 i 2 pq 2 1 x 1 1 i 1 pq q p 2 x 1 1 i 1 pq q p 2 d 2 a 20 ship 1 2 p 2 p 0 x 1 i 1 pqq q p 2 x 2 2 i 2 pq 2 d 2 in dodium expressions it is necessary to substitute calm decisions the purpose of this work was the calculation of the ak 0 k 1 2 and the study of the system 3 due to the complexity of calculating the functions ak 0 ffic the case of small 1 2 is considered periodic solutions of the unperturbed system in this case can be represented in a simpler form it is shown that the system 3 accepts the type u 1 2 3 b 11 sin p connect b 12 cos piron b 10 u 2 2 3 b 21 sin p connect b 22 cos puty 2 3 1 2 u 21 2 1 2 32 u 22 4 where bij const the species of the species 4 is considered in 3 the basic attention in this work is paid to the study of the behavior of phase curves depending on the parameter the work was carried out with the support of the rffif project no 06 01 00270 and the ns programs project no 9686 2006 1 178 the author expresses gratitude to his scientific supervisor a d morozov l and t r a t r a 1 karabanov a a morozov a d on the averaging near you born resonance in a four dimensional two frequency task of che proceedings of svmo 2004 t 6 no 1 c 292 357 2 morozov a d resonances cycles and chaos in quasigamil of tone systems m izhevsk nic regular and chaotic dynamics 2005 3 dragunov t n morozov a d potapov a v on the structure of renovated resonant zones in quasigamilton shtems with two degrees of freedom bulletin of the nsu a series of mathematics 2005 issue thirteen c 25 36 model of a gradient continuum obtained from the discrete microstructure of yu m prokhorov nizhny novgorod branch of the institute of machine studies named after a a blagonravova ras nizhny novgorod pum 2000 front ru in the last decade when modeling mechanical processes in structurally heterogeneous materials gradient models are widely used the first theory for which was built by mindlin in 1964 in particular the theory of grade continuums is used to describe dispersion waves in heterogeneous materials such a dispersion can be accurately described using a homogeneous gradient of the non continuum however in order to get an acceptable precision 179
