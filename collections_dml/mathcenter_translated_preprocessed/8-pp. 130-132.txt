the regional task of the riemann in case of degeneration of the symbol in the space of generalized functions on the segment of the actual axis with the main space of sm n is the lines of the functions gment pper t 130 having non integrated degree logarithmic features at the ends of the contour a b we will understand the integrals in the sense of the final part according to adamar designating f p topology in sm n is introduced using the system of norms eng t r max ware t lp 1 t lp 2 eng 1 t lp r i t a p m 1 b p n i i 1 2 r ware t lp 1 l 1 t onic t p dt 1 p p 1 analytical representation of the koshi generalized function f s ing n f z f x ih 1 2 i f t 1 t x ih is analytical in the plane z everywhere with the exception of the segment b the statement is true if f t s ing n onic t sm n exists then there is lim h 0 f x ih f x and the ratio is performed f f x f x sf f x f x f x f x purpose of s s n where sf gment f s accord sf 1 i f p b a onic t d the resulting formulas of sohotsky are used to solve the next task of linear conjugation with a degenerate symbol find the function f z the generalized limit values of which satisfy the regional condition t n f t t ng t f t ship t t ng t t on the segment b the actual axis where n is the whole non negative number a b g t s ing n onic t sm n 131 it is assumed that the coefficient of the task t c of a b accepts the actual positive values of and arg g t a b 0 it is proved that the solution of the formulated problem has the form f z x z 2 i g t x t 1 t z x z n 1 k 0 ak z k 1 where g t x t x t ak arbitrary permanent b a katz kazan the boundary values of the integral of the koshi on the self like fractal curve let are a closed curve on a complex plane and f t a function set on it if the curve is hidden and f l then with z 6 the function f z 1 2 i dt t z 1 called the cosa integral in this paper the integral 1 is studied in a situation where the curve is fractal and therefore unearthly despite this the integral exists with certain restrictions on and f let x are continuous monotonously increasing at x 0 the function is such that 0 0 the curve is called sprinkled if sup j rune zj zj 1 ger where supremum takes on all the final sequences of the points z 0 z 2 zj technology in the manner of bypass regarding the function f we assume that it satisfies the condition of the h lder with the indicator 0 1 it can be shown that the integral 1 exists as an integral of the style provided that the row is motor n 1 onic 1 1 n where onic is a function inverse to further the closed curve is called self like if for each point t you can indicate its arc 132
