mathematical modeling of the mechanical system pipeline summary of the pressure considers mathematical models of the mechanical sis of the theme pipeline pressure sensor as an example we give one of them in a linear production corresponding to the small deflection of the elastic element and small indignations of the velocity of the working environment the mathematical model is determined by the next equations and boundary conditions fjxx jyy o x y o oo 1 u 11 u 1 uo 2 ru x uo 2 t o x e o oo chjx o y t o y wo 2 a u b uo 2 62 ipx x yo t w y t u e a b lim r pipt x y t p t u e wo 2 uo 2 w oo l w mw dw 6 w 1 zw 7 w ro y t r pipt o u e a b here ip x y t the potential of the speed of the working environment w y t deflection of the elastic element uo transverse size of the pipeline water p t the law of change in the working environment at the input to the pipeline ro u t a distributed external load and b the coordinates of the ends of the element x y decartons coordinates bar and point correspond to differentiation according to x and t methods of the theory of the functions of a comprehensive variable solution of this task is reduced to study of the equation for the formation of the elastic element b l w p 0 y t p t jw r t lnlsin 1 gt sin 1 gu ldr u e a b 7 g uo uo a study of this equation is based on the application of the galerkin method according to which its solution is submitted in vi de n w y t l wk t sin vk y a vk 1 gk b a k l literature 1 velmisov p a reshetnikov yu a gorbokonenko in l mathematical modeta l incing of dynamics elastic e l data of dat chika matem methods and models in graff tasks of science and technology tr mezh conf klin 2003 ulyanovsk ulg tu 2003 t 5 s 24 30 63
