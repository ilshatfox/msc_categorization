analysis of the results of the application of the method of moments to the tasks of underground hydrodynamics in the work approximate analytical dependence for the pressure field in oil deposits by the projection method house of moments 1 graphs of approximations and accurate solutions using the excel 7 0 program are built the analysis of the results allows us to conclude that when solving specific tasks of developing oil fields with sufficient accuracy for practice it is possible to limit the approximations of the second and third orders the resulting analytical dependencies were used in solving the reverse problems of underground hydrodynamics in particular when determining the permeability coefficients hydraulic end and piezeceneability of the formation according to the specified commercial values of wells of wells literature 1 shaimuratov r b ilyasov r 3 modification of algorithm methods models when solving the problem of the theory of the fi l attraction theses of the dock siberian congress on graff and industrial mathematics novosibirsk publishing house of mat ki 2000 s 172 95
