the task of the conjugation for the equation of carleman voisa on the open riemannic surface for the equation of carleman folois dw aw bw f 1 on the open riemannic surface r is the regional reservation for gle g g ralky closed circuit on r the coefficients a and b are not supposed to be finite but are subordinated to the weak restrictions of the ideal border along the upper r pokuyano that the task 1 2 p normmlin at g t i about t e g and its index is 2 indg 1 h 1 where h is the genus of the surfaces r at h oo task 1 2 nutherov the races also watched the case when the coefficients of the regional condition are turned to zero in the final number of points the work was supported by the region
