the fundamental principle in the invariant subspace o a krivosheev 1 1 kriolesya 2006 yandex ru bashkir state university in the work studies complex sequences of the first order with the final maximum angular density the criterion was obtained when such a sequence is part of a properly distributed set with a given angular density on this basis complete decisions of the problematic principle and basis for the invariant subspace of analytical functions in a limited convex region are given key words invariant subspace basis fundamental principle let d convex region in c h d the space of the functions in d with the topology of uniform convergence on the compacts and k nk the sequence of complex numbers k and their multiples nk are such that the system e znexp k z k 1 n 0 nk 1 not full in h d through w d we denote the closure in h d of the linear shell of the e system then w d is a non trivial closed subspace in h d invariant relative to the differentiation operator is its multiple spectrum and e a set of own and attached functions in w d let m sm ger 1 we will say that is the replenishment pul 2 the symbol n 1 2 r is denoted by the number of points k taking into account their multiplications that have fallen into the sector teiphous onic 1 2 t 0 r they say 1 chap ii 1 that has an angular density in order of one if for all 8 2 except perhaps the counting set exists the limit of n 1 2 limr 2 r r put n 0 1 2 lim 0 limr mit n 1 2 r n 1 2 1 af r r many is called correctly distributed see 1 chap ii 1 if it has an angular density and a lindelaf condition is fulfilled i e there is a limit of limr k r nk k properly distributed sets are closely related to regular growth functions let f a whole function of the exponential type i e there are a b 0 such that f z a b z z c the upper indicator f is the function h f lim t ger ln f t t c the h f indicator is a convex positively uniform with a function that coincides with the complex support function of a certain convex compact k i e with the usual support function of a comprehensively associated with k compact called the conjugated diagram f see for example 2 chap i 5 theory 210 materials of the international school conference ma 5 4 h f hk sup zlex re z c they say see 1 chap iii that f has regular growth if h f lim t t e ln f t t c where e is a lot of zero relative measures on the beam 0 i e the measure of the lebbeg of its intersection with the interval 0 r is infinite in comparison with r with r urb let k convex compact and z 1 z 2 points of its border k through s z 1 z 2 k we denote the length of the arc k connecting z 1 and z 2 the movement along which from z 1 to z 2 is carried out in a negative direction clockwise for each r the intersection lus of the supporting line l gment z re zei pul hk ei accord and the borders k is either a point z gment or a segment a lot of k directions for which is a segment nothing more than counting put sk 1 2 sup z 1 lus z 2 ory s z 1 z 2 k the function sk fficuns 2 is non flowing in ising and non growing in ising and many of its gap points in both alternating coincides with the k if 8 2 k then sk 2 s z 1 z 2 k according to the theorem 4 of chapter iii of the book 1 the function f has regular growth and only when its zero set is correctly distributed in this case for all 1 2 k 0 2 pul the equality is true see 1 chap ii 1 formula 2 07 n 1 2 sk 1 2 2 1 where k is a conjugated diagram and is a multiple zero set f theorem 1 let k nk and k convex compact the statements are equivalent to 1 there is 0 that for all 2 k with condition 0 2 pulp the inequality n 0 1 2 sk nger nger 2 is performed 2 there is a replenishment of sequence which is a correctly distributed set and at the same time correct 1 let the k nk and d are a limited convex area recall see 3 that the sequence is compatible with d if it is part of the zero set taking into account the multiples of nk of the whole function f of the exponential type and regular growth the conjugated diagram of which is the closing of d area d i e h f hd hd let k d if is a properly distributed replenish satisfying 1 then its canonical function f has an indicator h f coinciding with hd see 1 chap ii theorem 4 it follows that the statement 2 theorem 1 equivalent to compatibility with the area d thus the investigation is true the following approved
