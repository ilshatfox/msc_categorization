a mixed non stationary task for the function of electric field strength in the study of electromagnetic phenomena in the atmosphere is often used by maxwell s equations in quasi stance electric approximation 1 2 however this approximation describes slow processes in the atmosphere well when describing fast processes for example thunderclasses it is necessary to consider the full system of maxwell s equations 52 in this work the system of equations of the maxwell of the species of the type rot h x t 4 c x t e x t j st x t 1 c e x t was studied x t t 1 rot e 1 c h x t t 2 in the area dipho nomorphic ball layer in r 3 with the border 1 2 1 2 two components of the coherence of the border each of which is dipho nomorphic to the sphere in r 3 t 0 t b 1 2 the assumption is taken into account that the magnetic and dielectric permeability satisfy the condition x t x t 1 system 1 2 is supplemented by the boundary condition of e 0 3 and the initial conditions e t 0 e 0 h t 0 h 0 4 in the subject of the task 1 4 it was supposed to x t the function of class c 1 0 t lip satisfying the condition 0 6 x t 6 j st x t a given class function c 1 0 t l 2 3 when studying atmospheric phenomena the main interest is the electrical field e x t to find the electric field from 1 2 the equation 1 c 2 2 2 2 t 2 4 c 2 t x t e x t can be obtained jst x t rot rot e x t 0 53 the generalized setting of the problem is formulated in the work the possibility of applying the galerkin method to it is justified 3 with which the existence of the existence and uniformity of the solution is proved in functional spaces determined by the setting of the task the issues of a numerical implementation of the solution of a mixed problem within the framework of the finite elements method are considered 3 4 i thank my supervisor alexei vyacheslavovich kalinin for setting the task and assistance in work l and t r a t r a 1 mareeve a anisimov s v global electric circuit as an open dissipative system proc 12 th int conf on atmosphereic electricity versailles 2003 p 797 800 2 kalinina v zhlikova a integral identity for determining the electrical potential in quasistational electric approximation vi russian conference on atmospheric electricity sat tr n novgorod 2007 s 53 54 3 temmar the equations of navier stox theory and numerical analysis m mir 1981 4 syarlef the method of final elements for elliptical tasks m mir 1980 54
