the existence of periodic points 98 continuous display on the fractal sets of e n makhrov nizhny novgorod state university named after n i lobachevsky elena makhrova inbox ru in this note examines dendrites with a fractal structure dandrite is understood as a local coherent continuum not containing subset homeomorphic circles in 1 the theorem of the existence of a motionless point in the continuous display of dendritus in itself was proven in 2 it was shown that the fact of the existence of a motionless point in continuous display f on the segment i provided i f i see for example 3 is not generalized in case of arbitrary continuous displays of dendrites theorem let f x x continuous display of dendritus x in itself and there is a final tree y x such that y f y then y per f 6 the approval of the theorem is not fair if y is a dendritus with a counting set of branches of branching consider the following example let the dendrite x and display f x x are defined in the theorem with 4 we denote through o o point with the coordinates 1 2 3 2 a a point with coordinates 1 2 1 ai 1 in the point of intersection of arcs i 1 in i 1 in 0 i 1 in 1 where i 1 in 0 1 determine the dendritis z x o a here o a a segment connecting the points o and a and display g z z putting 1 g o a a 2 g i 1 i 1 o a linear homeomorphism such that g ai 1 o g o a for i 1 0 1 3 g i 1 in i 1 in i 1 in 1 linear homeomorphism 99
