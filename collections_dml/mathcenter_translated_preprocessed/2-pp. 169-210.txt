the iterative methods for mesh variational inequalities introduction 1 1 we consider the finite dimensional variational inequalities or inclusions of one of the following classes au cu 3 f 1 which be refered as problem p 1 or au b f cu 2 which we call by the problem p 2 in these variational inequalities a l rn rn corresponds to a mesh approximation finite difference or finite element of linear partial differential operator while nonlinear generally multivalued operator c is responsible for the constraints in the problem as for the term b b l rn rn it may be viewed as an approximation for the nonlinear convective term in the differential problem under consideration there are a lot of variational inequalities and differential inclusions of practical importance which mesh approximations lead to finite dimensional problem of the first or second types namely mesh schemes for obstacle problem and dam problem mathematical model constructed using baiocchi transformation implicit mesh schemes on the fixed time level for one phase or two phase stefan problem and 169 some others can be written as the problem p 1 on the other hand mesh approximations on fixed time level for stefan like problems with nonlinear convective terms and the problems of fluid flows in porous medium under the gravity forces have the form p 2 below in section 1 2 we construct finite difference or finite element schemes for some model problems these mesh schemes have the form p 1 or p 2 in s 1 of this article we study existence and uniqueness of the solutions for problems p 1 and p 2 the existence of the solutions for both problems are proved using rather standard technique the proof of the uniqueness of the solution for the problem p 2 is based on the comparison results of 8 which play the crucial role also in the analysis of the convergence for iterative methods of relaxation types iterative methods for p 1 and p 2 are constructed and studied in s 2 and s 3 we pay special attention to iterative methods constructed on the basis of domain decomposition technique both with overlapping and non overlapping subdomains in s 2 we unit in one class block coordinate relaxation methods multisplitting methods alternative schwarz methods and study their convergence for p 1 p 2 with m matricies a and b splitting iterative methods and their application to domain decomposition methods with nonoverlapping subdomains are studied for the problem p 1 with positive definite matrix a in s 3 the main results here are the rate of convergence and theoretically optimal choice of iterative parameters the article ends with the appendix in which some results on the monotone operators m matricies and convex functions theories are collected the iterative methods based on the domain decomposition are thoroughly studied for linear equations see the books 15 16 survey articles 2 10 and proceedings of conferences on ddm a few articles deal with the schwarz alternating iterative methods for some classes of variational inequalities which can be written in the form p 1 or its generalization for nonlinear a namely 4 5 11 12 18 19 20 21 moreover as a rule convergence results are proved if starting from specially choosen initial guess super or subsolution for the studied problem according to terminology of this article more general results on the convergence of iterative methods for p 1 as well as several results for problem p 2 are studied in 8 170 the splitting algorithms for finding a zero of the sum of two maximal monotone operators were studied in 13 3 some error bounds for these methods were obtained in the case when a is single valued monotone and lipschitz continuous operator better error bounds were derived in 6 for the case of linear self adjoint operator a and in 9 for the case of nonlinear operator a two lewel iterative method with positive definite non self adjoint preconditioner for p 1 where c ik ik is the subdifferential of indicator function for a convex set k was studied in 17 it was shown that this method can be treated as the partial case of splitting method for sum of two maximal monotone operators and its convergence was proved we refer to 17 also for bibliograthy of the papers concerning the splitting methods for variational inequalities 1 2 several examples of variational inequalities vi s and their mesh approximations let be a polygonal domain in r 2 with boundary by h 1 we denote the sobolev space of the functions u l 2 such that u xi l 2 i we equip this space by the inner product u v uv u v dx and the corresponding norm u h 1 u u the functions from h 1 which traces in the boundary are equal to zero form the space h 10 example 1 let k u h 10 u x 0 a e in be the convex closed set in h 10 we look for the following vi which is tradition
