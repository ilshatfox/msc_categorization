the projectivization of the conformal model of the stratification of the hemisphere of m v dyachkov kazan state university will consider the 3 dimensional unit unit unprofitable algebra of the second type 1 it has a structure of the customs of the customs of the rank of rank 2 the stratification of the hemisphere s 2 1 determined by the subparagraph of double numbers is considered in 2 we build a conformal model of this hemisphere s 2 1 to study its main stratification according to the sub hepatre of double numbers to do this we expand the semi evclidic space to the design space p 3 we introduce homogeneous coordinates y 0 y 1 y 2 y 3 assuming xi yi y 3 i 0 1 2 then the equation of quadric s 2 1 x 20 x 21 1 sets in p 3 the material cone y 20 y 21 y 23 0 1 attributed to the canonical reper e 0 e 1 e 2 e 3 stereographic projection of the plane p 2 y 0 0 per cone 1 from the pole n 1 0 0 1 should be considered only when y 3 6 0 therefore taking the line y 3 0 for the unreasonable and introducing descartes coordinates u 1 y 1 y 3 u 2 y 2 y 3 we get in the plane y 0 0 semi euclidean structure a 2 with a linear element ds 20 du 21 the cone crosses the plane a 2 by pair of imaginary parallel lines u 21 1 we normalize the cone 1 auto polar taking straight ligaments with a fixed center e 0 for normal p e 0 and for normal the second kind of pii their polar straight lines belonging to the planes y 0 0 the projective plane p 2 is also normalized 84 since the point e 0 is selected constant the derivative equations of the normalized plane p 2 y 0 0 contains only two equations ix yi lix jyi ljyi pjix we set the normal pii with the reference points yi ix lix the decompositions jyi ljyi s ijys pijx determine projectively euclidean connectivity kij and tensor pij thus considering the structure of the semi european plane with rectangular coordinates ui in the a 2 we get a conformal model of a polar normalized project of p 2 with a linear element ds 2 du 21 1 u 2 1 2 the resulting non euclidean space is conformally semi sabbath to the bottom plane the metric teaser gij and the curvature tensor r r kji in this connection is cowardly constant the plane p 2 has constant curvature consider the stratification of this space determined by the subparagraph of double numbers the planes y 0 y 1 v y 2 0 where v r set the equations of layers in the projective space p 3 having examined them together with the equation of the cone 1 the 1 parametric family of layers of stratification on kos nus with a stereographic display it will go into 1 parametric parametric parameter u 2 1 2 v u 1 1 2 with a top at a point 1 0 symmetrical relatively straight u 1 1 l and t r a t r a t ral 1 vishnevsky v v shirokov a p shurygin v v about wandering over algebrays kazan publishing house kazan university 1985 263 p 2 dyachkova m v the stratification of the sphere induced by the main stratification of 3 algebra of the second type and its semi conform john 85 terment proceedings of the fourth kolmogor readings in the press 3 shirokov a p nonevlid space kazan edged in the cauldron university 1997 50 p on structure in groups e 6 2 e 6 with an odd q m e eliseev nizhny novgorod state technical university it is proved that automorphism ffic with the property xwor x 1 sts 1 x t t is the subgroup of it acts only in groups e 6 q 2 e 6 q when q is odd groups for which there is non trivial automorphism with a indicated property are further called groups information about them can be found in 1 2 3 the structure introduced in this way is inherited when the transition to anvarian under groups and factor groups according to invariant normal divisors in subsequent considerations it is often applied to the painted c n structure let t t c c t and n n t it is easy to check that n 1 c so n and c lead to the same quasi group therefore n t n 1 n 1 t or t t n 1 n n 1 and in t contains an element of a simple order dividing the index n c in particular if t c then n and c must match 86 at the final stages of evidence the following results are used theorem 1 3 if in the compositional series of the group there are insoluble simple factors of types for which vent the deo rema has already been proven we have ln sp 2 n un on then there are involution in t theorem 2 2 if 2 1 in group 1 then resolves the proof passes according to the following scheme 1 it is known 4 that the automorphism of a simple group cannot be regular so t 1 2 we prove that there are semi free elements in t 3 we prove that in t there is involution 4 we prove the identity gment drying 1 t contains semi free elements in case of proof of this proposal information from 6 about the conjugation of uniples with their degrees was used significant about at once in group e 6 q when considering the classes of these elements three cases are distinguished a ch k 3 c q 1 mod
