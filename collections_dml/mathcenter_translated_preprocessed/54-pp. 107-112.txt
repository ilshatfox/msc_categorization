combinations of products of cylindrical functions a a gimaltdinova zeros of a function that is the sum of products of bessel functions with opposite indices are investigated keywords the bessel function the modified bessel function the set of zeros of the function udc 517 9 on the use of the apparatus of generalized degrees of bers to build basic solutions of the equations of the highest order yu a gladyshev 1 v v kalmanovich 2 1 v 572264 yandex ru kaluga state university named after k e tsiolkovsky 2 kaluga state university named after k e tsiolkovsky shows that the method of generalized degrees proposed by bers and widespread to the operators of the degree of the first allows us to reduce the solution of the equations of the second and higher orders to build decisions of differential 108 materials of the international school conference of the first order equations examples of using the method to find solutions of equations of different types are given at the same time a complete coincidence of the results with previously known is shown the possible ways to generalize the method to equations with a large number of independent variables are indicated key words generalized degrees generalized constant differential equations laplace equation the concept of a generalized degree was introduced by bers 1 with the spread of methods of the theory of the functions of the complex alternating to the system of equations of the koshi riman type with variable coefficients the generalized degree of bers n c was defined as a function built by the sequential use of the integral operator i x n c n i nc x 0 c c which is the right reverse for the specified differential operator d d i 1 to the function c taken from the nucleus of the operator d in a given linear space l dc 0 studying the properties of linear combinations of generalized degrees bers introduced the princess of correspondence when a row in ordinary variables is compared with a series of generalized degrees with the same coefficients based on the principle of conformity the symbols of sinmx x x 0 cosmx x x 0 were introduced satisfying relative to the rules formally similar to different differentiation rules the concept of the principle of conformity in a slightly different sense called replaceement method was used by protter 2 to build generalized spherical harmonics in these studies the operator d remained a first order operator with a given variable coefficients in this message an attempt was made to take as d the operator higher than the first order since both methods lead to an unambiguous result when setting additional completely fulfilled requirements the report introduced the concept of the bx operator which is analytically set in the form of a row by the ratio f x in ordinary variables compares the linear ratio between the generalized degrees of bx x 0 n f f x here the function f x was obtained after substituting a generalized degree through ordinary variables in brackets in bx all the necessary additional information is indicated for example the procedure n operator d the integration limits when a generalized degree is found etc in this work the case of operators d of the order is considered higher than the first for the first time this question was raised in a monograph 3 where a generalization of the concept of yu a gladyshev v v kalmanovich 109 generalized degree for operators of a higher order it is of interest as d choose an fold derivative operator d d d x 1 in this case a generalized constant has the form of a polynomial c c 0 c 1 x c 1 x 1 and the integral operator i is quite simple so that the generalized degree has the form x n x 0 n x 2 n 2 n c 0 x 2 n 1 2 n 1 c 1 1 x 2 n 1 2 n 1 c 1 for example if 2 then we have d d 2 d x 2 x n x 0 n x 2 n 2 n c 0 x 2 n 1 2 n 1 c 1 take as the initial function f x cekx which gives a solution to the simplest equation d fd x k f let s move on to a generalized degree we get the function f x c 1 ch p kx c 2 sh p kx which satisfies the equation d 2 f d x 2 kf it is obvious that the appearance of two generally speaking new arbitrary constants is quite natural and necessary since the equation for f x of the second order we show the effect of the operator bx x 0 2 as the initial function we take the solution f x t x t nc 2 equations f x f t 0 apply the correspondence operator bx x 0 2 k 2 we have bx x 0 2 f x t x t nc n i 0 c in x n i x 0 t i the expression x t nc after substituting a generalized degree can be expressed through the polynomas of the ermit f x x t nc n 2 n h 2 n cil c 0 n 2 n 1 h 2 n 1 c 1 x 2 p t 110 materials of the international school conference and gives a solution to the second order equation 2 f x 2 f t 0 if the equation is taken with another sign under the derivative of t f x f t 0 3 then we have a solution f 1 p x t 4 having features on the line x t 0 if p 2 then d
