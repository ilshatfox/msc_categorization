the generalized cauchy problem for elliptic equations at the ends of riemannian manifolds of a special type a n kondrashov we consider a linear elliptic differential equation u c x u 0 defined on a riemannian manifold m that has an end x on which the metric takes the form dl 2 h 2 r dr 2 q 2 r d 2 in appropriate coordinates here r r 0 s and s is a smooth compact riemannian manifold with metric d 2 at the end x the coefficient c x takes the form c x c r for ends of parabolic type and for ends of hyperbolic type with such metrics we formulate versions of the generalized cauchy problem with initial data at the infinitely remote point and study its solubility the results obtained are new and in the case of ends of parabolic type somewhat unexpected keywords non compact riemannian manifold end of a manifold generalized cauchy problem 517 98 1 1 akorolev 5 yandex com f x h f x h f x y x y h y y f 0 0 f 1 x f x f 0 h 1 h f 0 h f f x h h f x h t h t 0 h y t 0 1 y y y 0 0 y 1 h t x t 0 1 x f x t y t x 0 0 x 1 f x h 201 t f f x t y t t df x t x t y t y t y ay b 1 a y y b b a h y y 0 0 y 1 h b a h a h a v x x x df x v x af x b 2 x v x x 0 0 3 x 0 1 a b 1 h v x 2 3 x t 0 1 a x 1 f x h 2 v x v x x c 1 x x c 2 3 t 0 h df x a v x 2 3 a 0 1 a a ai a i
