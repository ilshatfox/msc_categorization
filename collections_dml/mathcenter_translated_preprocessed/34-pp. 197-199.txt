linear decisions of one class of dynamic systems on the torah yu v tretyachenko nizhny novgorod state university named after n i lobachevsky tretyachenko y v mail ru the system considers the system of differential equations p 1 x cos y q 1 x sin y r 1 x x x y p 2 x cos y q 2 x sin y r 2 x y x y 1 on a two dimensional torah in the assumption that pi x qi x ri x i 1 2 trigonometric polynomas of the voluntary stitch n n n above the field r x x y 6 0 y x y x x y 6 const 199 for the system 1 with the assumptions made is decided for the cottage about the existence of trajectories set by linear equation y x y 0 x y 0 mod 2 0 2 it was established that all the permissible values b 2 are distant so that the corresponding trajectory is closed on the torah the work examines the issue of the existence and the number of other closed trajectories this part of the problem was completely solved for the case when x x y const 6 0 3 that is for the case when the system of system 1 is the grave curves of the equations dy dx p 2 x cos y q 2 x sin y r 2 x the main results can be formulated by a trace theorem 1 if the system 1 has the trajectories of the species 2 then a m 1 2 n m 1 n n 0 2 n at the same time if is the permissible integer then the indicated trajectories on the torah are no more than two if is fractional then such a trajectory is the only one theorem 2 in order for the system 1 to have two trajectories of the species 2 with 0 1 n it is necessary and enough for y x y x x y p x b cos y x y 0 4 200 where p x trigonometric with polin of a special species y 0 b some constant at the same time if the condition 3 is fulfilled then either both trajectories 2 are simple maximum cycles and there are no other limiting cycles on the torah or all the trajectories are closed to the torah theorem 3 the trajectory 2 corresponding to the fractional a exists in the case if the identity is performed 4 at the same time such a trajectory is the only one and if the condition 3 is fulfilled then all the trajectories will be closed on the torah the coefficient criteria for the existing linear trajectory with each all over a in the case when the condition 3 is fulfilled the unprofitable and sufficient conditions for the possible implementation of one of the following topological structures either the curve 2 about the perenniral cycle are substantiated on the torah there is exactly one simple maximum cycle of a more complex analytical nature or 2 there are no complex maximum multiplicity cycle of two and there are no other maximum cycles on the torah or all systems of the system 1 are closed on the torah l and t r a t r a 1 erekhtina g m tretyachenko yu v the study of one differential equation on the torah in the case of existing linear solutions dep viniti no 312 b 2006 2 ershov e k on the number of maximum cycles of some differential equations on two dimensional torah different cyanic equations minsk 1991 t 27 no 12 c 2167 2169 201
