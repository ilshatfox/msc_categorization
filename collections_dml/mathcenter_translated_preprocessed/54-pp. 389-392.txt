approximations of almost periodic functions in a uniform metric of yu kh khasanov 1 1 yukhas 60 mail ru the russian tajik slavic university studies the question of the approach of almost periodic functions with whole functions of the final degree with an arbitrary spectrum in a uniform metric the necessary and sufficient conditions for belonging to uniformly periodic functions are also established by the class of entire functions key words almost periodic functions rows of fourier a spectrum of function whole functions of a final degree trigonometric polynomes the best uniform approximation determination 1 1 the function continuous on the entire material axis f x is called uniformly periodic if for each 0 can indicate a positive number l l which in each interval of length l is at least one number for which inequality is performed f x f x least x mm the space of uniform almost periodic functions we denote it cut b is the closure of many trigonometric polynomials t x n k 1 ak exp i k x where ak fourier coefficients k are fourier spectrum of function f x b with the norm f x b sup ip x mm f x consider the class of functions f x b with an arbitrary spectrum k i e functions that have a number of fourier species f x k mm ak exp i k x where ak lim t t t t f x exp i k x d x it is known 2 that for the class of functions f x b the value of ak can differ from zero no more than on the counting set of spectrum values it is this circumstance that makes it possible to spread the concept of a number of fourier to the area of almost periodic functions through g 0 we denote a class of limited over the entire axis of entire functions of the degree not higher than consider the following important issue let 390 materials of the international school conference given the function f x b what are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the belonging of this function to the class of g to resolve this issue we give a statement that was previously used by the author in the work 3 theorem 1 in order for the uniform almost periodic function f x to be appropriate for the class of gx it is necessary and enough for its indicators fourier k to satisfy inequality k s n bernstein 4 found that among the functions from the class g performing on the entire actual axis the best uniform approximation of the 2 periodic function f x is found by a trigonometric of polynoma degree not higher than the proof is based on the fact that if g f x g and sup mm x mm f x g f x a f 1 where a f is the best uniform approximation of the order 2 periodic period 2 the functions through the functions from class g s then evenly in all x least x have places assessments f x 1 2 n 1 n k n g x 2 k a f 2 lim n 1 2 n 1 n k n g x 2 k 2 g x 2 k 0 3 note that the above the result of s n bernstein can also be obtained if instead of 2 and 3 use the ratio n x q n n x a f where 0 n n any natural numbers n x 1 f x t fn t d t 1 2 n 2 n 2 n f x t fn t d t q n n x 1 2 n 2 n 2 n f x t fn t d t fn t sin 2 n 1 t 2 2 n 1 sin 2 t 2 and with any fixed n evenly in x least lim n q n n x 2 q n n x 0 when conducting similar studies in contrast to periodic servants tea where the conditions are applied only to the smoothness of the functions for f x b additional conditions are required and the behavior of the fourier indicators see e g 5 or 6 a when fourier indicators have an endless point in infinity i e yu kh khasanov 391 k k 1 lim k k inous b when fourier indicators have a maximum point in zero k k 1 lim k mm k 0 for the first time analogue of the theorem s n bernstein for functions f x b is found in the works of e a bredikhina 7 8 using the method of proof s n bernstein she found that if the function f x b has a number fourier f x k ak exp i k x having fourier indicators with the limiting point in infinity then among the functions of gl x glit 0 for which there is an equality 1 there is a trigonometric of polynon degree not higher than now using the theorem 1 we formulate the main result of this note which is also an analogue of s n bernstein for uniform almost periodic functions with arbitrary fourier indicators k k 0 1 2 theorem 2 let f x b and a f sup mm x mm f x g f x 0 then for any 0 there is the final trigonometric sum piot x n k 1 bk exp i k x k for which the assessment is evenly valuable f x p x a f to complete the presentation along with the theorem 2 we give the following statement when the spectrum k at any final segment has a final number of maximum points and moreover the multiple is given
