the effect of the shielding of the anode surface on the asymmetry of the electrochemical forming v v klokov kazan state university vladimir klokov ksu ru electrochemical processing echo of metals is successfully used in mechanical engineering 1 the result is achieved due to the anodic dissolution of the surface in an appropriate electrolyte in this way the burrs are removed and the sharp edges of various parts are rounded holes are flashed the blades of turbines and compressors are processed calibration and many other operations are performed the echo is a complex process which is generally described by the laws of electrochemistry magnetic hydrodynamics and thermal mass combin an analysis of the available data 2 shows that the main effect on the rate of dissolution of the metal has intensity of the electric field and the distribution of the specific electrical conductivity of the medium in the gap between the anode and the cathode in the first approximation when the environment can be considered homogeneous the potential of the field is a harmonic function the boundary conditions for it should be given taking into account emelene processes in the electrolyte 3 in some cases the border of the clearance can be considered equitaneical 2 however this is not enough for a complete setting of the edge task since the shape of the dissolving surface is unknown in advance another condition is necessary to determine it and here the stationary regime of the echo is of independent interest when the cathode tool is slowly approaching on the processed anode surface and the shape of the interelectrode clearance does not change this mode is found during firmware cutting grinding and other technological processes in this case the law of movement of the instrument and the law of the anodic dissolution of the metal determine the boundary condition closing the task in 2 a wide class of flat tasks of a stationary echo is considered they are reduced to the tasks of hydromechanics a number of exact decisions have been obtained the relevant productions and solution methods are illustrated below on a specific example of the problem of a stationary echo with a given cathode instrument in order to determine 62 influence on the asymmetry of the anode boundary of the presence of a site on it which brinomes and localizes the processing zone the solution to the problem as in 2 was obtained by the method of the year of speed the cross sectional diagram of the interelectrode gap in the plane parallel nature of the fields of all variable values is presented in fig 1 the localizing part of the bc anode border can occur naturally with the course of electrolyte from the left side of the cross section to the right but can be artificially created from the insoluble metal coating of the anode moving along with a cathode tool separate tasks related to the presence of the screen anode polarized and insoluble in the processing process were considered in the work 4 5 the study of the distribution of potential with an additional electrode is presented in the work 6 the location of additional electrodes for aligning the current density on the cathode surface is used in galvanostegia 3 with dimensional electrochemical processing the effect of shielding is practically not studied it is believed that the determining forming is the nature of a stationary electric field in a gap for assumptions of the so called ideal model 1 2 in fig 1 line ab the desired stationary anode border bc is an anode border parallel to the cathode tool c c a d kv d zd y 1 fig 1 the cross section diagram of the gap 1 the screen m b a 63 adc and the localizing processing zone the location of this section parallel to the kv supply speed is characterized by the distance d the thickness of the tool is neglected in order to compare with a well known parabolic solution to the problem when in the absence of a localization section of the anode border the type of parabola 2 1 2 y x 2 hereinafter all the geometric dimensions of the real interelectrode clearance are attributed to the dimensional quantity k u u h v where is the output electrics is the electrical conductivity of the
