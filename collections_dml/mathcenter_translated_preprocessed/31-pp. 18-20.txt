the use of maple software to create animation of fundamental physical processes by m r bagautdinov tatar state humanitarian and pedagogical university kazan mansour rambler ru many fundamental physical processes are described by differential equations which in some cases are reduced to non linear than the ode or equations of mathematical physics typically nonlinear ode systems are only explored by high quality methods the package of symbolic mathematics maple allows you to build numerical models of these processes and importantly animize them and create a dynamic model of processes which allows you to better imagine the consequences of these processes as an example we consider two fundamental physical processes a spontaneous disorder of symmetry and cooling of the plate based on the process of spontaneous violation of 19 symmetry all theories of the great association are built from a mathematical point of view in the simplest case this process can be described by a nonlinear ode of the 2 nd order an equation of oscillations in a symmetrical potential pit of the species u x 2 y 2 where 0 and 0 a change in potential energy depending on the time from considering the non linear friction force is described by the differential equation m 2 x 4 x 2 k where m is body weight k is the coefficient of friction the differential equation is solved in numerically using the maple symbolic mathematics package in the assumption m 3 k 0 1 6 1 and x 0 0 0 0 using the obtained numerical decision is located dependence x t fig 1 and the dependence of potential energy on time u t fig 2 animated graphs are built the process of cooling the plate is described by the parabolic type let u x t the temperature of a one dimensional rod at point x at the time of time t at the initial point in time t 0 the temperature of the rod was distributed according to the law u x 0 x the ends of the rod are attached to the thermostat and they are supported by constant for example zero temperature then the cooing equation will have the form of t u x t a 2 2 x 2 u x t 0 in the maple package we create the procedure for solving the equation and anamize u x t fig 3 20
