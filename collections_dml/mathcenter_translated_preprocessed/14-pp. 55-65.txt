the orders of the boundary zeros of the solutions of the degree of riemann the degree of riemann t g t t t l 1 of which are boundary zeros j l j 1 r was considered in the works 1 8 in this case the study was conducted in two directions depending on the setting of the task at the first production 1 6 an analytical continuation t and t in the semi oral zero in d and d respectively and with functional indicators and in addition the fulfillment of the regional condition on the multi leaf circuit 3 5 or on one leafy 6 during the second setting 7 such a continuation was not required here the functions z were considered solutions if there were branches t and t on the arcs l j r 1 for which the condition 1 was fulfilled this difference led to the fact that in the first case the functions t t at each point j had a whole order and during the second setting a fractional order was allowed an attempt to study the problem in a fractional order it was made in 8 but the final result is true only for a whole order in this work the task 1 with indicators r is considered in the second formulation the equivalence of the nonlinear task and counting set of linear homogeneous tasks of riemann with a breakdown coefficient is shown the structure of the order of zeros on the circuit on the circuit was obtained the limited number of boundary zeros was proved when and are rational and unlimited 61 when or is irrational the arbitrariness of the constant solutions has been investigated 1 let l a smooth closed contour that divides the plane into areas d 0 d and d d oriented counterclockwise it is required to find all the functions z 6 0 with z c l analytical in c l continuously continuously on l on the left and right i e z hipp d c d having r 0 different zeros on l i e z h 0 0 r according to the boundary condition t t t t l 2 where r z let j r 1 through j l j 1 r r 1 the points are indicated the solutions are indicated the condition l condition 2 located in the order of positive bypass understand so that there are branches of ln t on the open arcs l in which the equality of exp ln t t exp ln t 3 a at points j j lim exp ln t 0 j lim exp ln t 0 for t j t l the setting of the task shows that in the general case the function ln t which means t t do not continue analytically in the semi orality of j points respectively in d and d however since z 6 0 with z d there are branches of logarithms we call them l n z which are analytical in d from ln t on arcs they differ in numbers multiple 2 i and without limiting the community we can assume that they coincide on the arc 1 2 from 3 we have exp l n t 2 in t t exp l n t 2 in t 4 where n t linge and maintenance functions with ruptures at points j j 1 r taking integers enter the function f z from hinger c d f z exp l n z f z exp l n z 5 f j lim f z 0 z j z d f z 6 0 z d i e f z h 0 0 r for her we have from 4 f t t exp 2 in t f t t l 6 here n t 0 t 1 2 k j 2 kj lj t k k 1 k 2 r 7 62 r 1 1 kj lj z any n t 0 for r 1 thus if z are solutions to 2 then f z diluted in 5 satisfy the condition 6 back if f z solutions to the problem 6 then the functions z f z 1 z f z 1 8 where the branches are taken the analytical respectively in d will satisfy the regional condition 2 7 indeed let f z solving the problem 6 take z from 8 then f z z exp l n z f z exp l n z exp l n t t exp 2 in t l n t it follows that the branches of ln t which satisfy 3 will be ln t l n t 2 i k j 2 kj ln t l n t 2 i k j 2 lj t k k 1 k 2 r the theorem 1 problem 2 and tasks 6 are equivalent to kj lj z their solutions are connected by formulas 5 8 we study the tasks 6 with r 1 we get a solution that are different from zero only at 0 f z c z 1 f c z 1 z 9 under r 2 we solve the problem 6 with the explosive coefficient t exp 2 in t following 9 p 254 let z 1 2 i l ln d j 2 k 1 k j 2 kj lj d z where the branch of the logarithm ln is fixed to l 1 ln exp 2 in t 0 t 1 2 2 i k j 2 kj lj t k k 1 63 x fractional part x for the canonical function take z z 1 1 exp z 1 r j 2 kj lj where x is the whole part x then different from zero solution we get the problem 1 0 f z p 1 z 1 1 r 2 z j z 1 kjj lj 10 f z z kin z z 1 r j 2 z j z 1 kj lj 11 where is p 1 z mn
