initial substructures of the structure of n c e degrees one of the principal directions in the study of degrees of unsolvability of sets of ershov s difference hierarchy is the development of their structural theory the first significant result concerning the structures of the n c e degrees for n 1 distinguishing them from the c e degrees was provided by arslanov 1 2 every nonzero n c e degree can be joined to 0 i e can be cupped by an incomplete d c e degree for n 1 cooper 3 and yates unpublished had already shown that there exists a nonzero c e degree which is not cuppable by any incomplete c e degree this gave a difference between elementary theories of c e and n c e degrees for every n 1 other elementary differences between these structures were provided by downey 4 who proved that the diamond lattice can be embedded into the d c e degrees preserving 0 and 1 while by the lachlan 5 nondiamond theorem this is not true for the c e degrees and by cooper harrington lachlan lempp and soare 6 who established a nondensity result for the n c e degrees n 1 for every n 1 there exists a maximal incomplete n c e degree in the n c e degrees for n c e degrees the density problem has some variants namely studying weak density properties of d c e degrees cooper lempp and watson 7 showed that for any n 0 and c e degrees c a there exists a properly n c e degree b such that c b a cooper and yi 8 for n 2 and arslanov laforte and slaman 9 for n 1 showed that for n 1 any n c e degree b and any c e degree a a b there exists a d c e degree c with a c b recently extending both the weak density theorem of cooper and yi and cooper s splitting theorem cooper 10 cooper and li 11 proved that for any d c e degree a and any c e degree b a there are d c e degrees x 0 and x 1 such that b x 0 x 1 a and x 0 x 1 a cooper and li 12 proved that in the n c e degrees n 1 cooper s splitting theorem cannot be combined with cone avoidance given n 1 there exists a n c e degree a and a c e degree b such that 0 b a and for any n c e degrees x y if x y 0 then either b x or b y 22 main results of this paper are the following theorem 1 let e and d be d c e sets and x a c e set such that d t e x t e d 6 t x and d and e are c e in x then there exists a d c e set u such that x t u t e and u t d theorem 2 there are c e set d a d c e set e and a 3 c e set f with such that 1 t d t e t f 2 for every 3 c e set u t f either u t e or e t u d 3 for every 3 c e set u t e either u t d or d t u an important corollary from these two theorems is that the sentence d 0 e d f e u u 6 f u e e u d u 6 e u d d u holds in the 3 c e degrees and fails in the d c e degrees r e f e r e n c e s 1 arslanov m m structural properties of the degrees below 0 sov math dokl n s 1985 283 2 p 270 273 2 arslanov m m on the upper semilattice of turing degrees below 0 sov math 1988 7 p 27 33 3 cooper s b on a theorem of c e m yates handwritten notes 1974 4 downey r g d r e degrees and the nondiamond theorem bull london math soc 1989 21 p 43 50 5 lachlan a h lower bounds for pairs of recursively enumerable degrees proc london math soc 1966 16 p 537 569 6 cooper s b harrington l lachlan a h lempp s and soare r i the d r e degrees are not dense ann pure and applied logic 1991 55 p 125 151 7 cooper s b lempp s and watson p weak density and cupping in the d r e degrees israel j math 1989 67 p 137 152 8 cooper s b and yi x 1996 isolated d r e degrees 1996 preprint 9 arslanov m m laforte g l and slaman t a relative recursive 23 enumerability in the difference hierarchy j symb logic 1998 63 p 411 420 10 cooper s b a splitting theorem for the n r e degrees proc amer math soc 1992 115 p 461 471 11 cooper s b and li a turing definability in the ershov hierarchy to appear 12 cooper s b and li a splitting and cone avoidance in the d c e degrees science in china series a 2002 45 p 1135 1146 s b cooper leeds united kingdom pmt 6 sbc leeds ac uk incomputability fifty years after alan turing in the fifty years since turing died on the 7 th june 1954 his work on mathematics logic and computer science has continued to exercise a unique influence at the heart of his research was a lifelong concern with questions of computability and in particular the need to find out more about the interface both in the mathematics of the real world and in relation to the human mind between computability and incomputability the existence of unsolvable problems ha
