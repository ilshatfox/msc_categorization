the worst fractions of the week discuss the functions of the type rn z n j 1 1 z aj where aj poles of the function rn z some points of the complex plane c are not necessarily different obviously rn z is a logarithmic derivative of a certain polynomial degree n for point b c and functions f analytical in some single copper vicinity u point b following 1 put z f z z b f d where integration is carried out according to any hidden the paths l b z from this surroundings leading from b to z with n 1 the most rational differential of order n 1 functions f z at point b in some single line vicinity u which f z is unambiguous and analytical or the most common fraction of the n th order of the function f z at point b we call the smallest fraction of rn f b z the order n with the property f z rn f b z o z b n at z b theorem 1 rn f b z coincides with the logarithmic derivative of the partial amount n k 0 ck z b k of a number of taylor function e z at point b theorem 2 let the function f analytical in some vicinity of point b c the positive number r is such that a number of taylor of the e z function with the center at point b converges on the circle z z b r r const 0 r then for an arbitrary compact e z z b r which does not contain the poles of the function f the unrequited inequality of lim sup n rn f b f e r r is performed theorem 3 let f h 1 b 0 z f z 0 r 1 144 dr z z r then there is such a n 0 that for all n n rn f b f c dr c f h 1 f dr dr rn 1 r where c x y 1 xe 2 x 3 1 y ey the work was supported by the russian federation project 99 01 00119 l and t r a t r a 1 danechenko v i danchenko d ya on uniform approximation by logarithmic derivatives of polynomials theor functions its adj and related cry mater school honf dedicated 130 th anniversary of the birth d f egorova kazan 13 18 september 1999 kazan publishing house of kazan matte o va 1999 s 74 77 v a koshcheev yekaterinburg about one overdeck hypothesis relating to the systems of complex functions that satisfy haar in 1971 continuing the research of marcheum schlenberg and yang 1 formulated the hypothesis 2 according to which the arreous continuum q allowing the system of linearly independent complex continuous functions satisfying the condition of haar homomorphone with a flat subset as a haar showed in the material case and a n kolmogorov 3 in the complex polynomes according to the system of functions with the condition of the haar given and continuously on the compact q have the property of the uniqueness of the best approximation for any continuous function t haara condition characterizes chebyshev systems we consider the task with additional restriction of naq namely we require arcuate coherence of not only the q continuum itself but also each of its percontinum and call it 145
