the spreading of a drop along the interposed surface in the work solves a two dimensional problem of spreading a liquid drop along the border of two non laughing liquids on the flat interference border of two non funeous liquids with densities t and b upper and lower respectively a cylindrical drop of the third liquid d is placed fig 1 the density t d b varies so that the drop does not pop up but also does not sink further a drop under the action of the power of buoyancy and hydrodynamic forces spreads along the interference border numeric calculations were carried out on the basis of the ftm 1 method 2 originally formulated for the case of two phase boundaries 3 and modified for calculating currents with contact points of several interfacial boundaries the system is considered as a single continuous environment with explosive values of physical parameters and interfacial interaction is taken into account in the navier stake equations up to 41 with a full integral on the interfactions u t u u 1 p f u tu nively x x ds where u p is the speed and pressure of the liquid f volumetric forces and curvature and curvature and curvature the surface tension coefficient of the interference surface calculations were carried out in a wide range of minton numbers m g 4 l 2 l 3 and an ete e g d 2 10 5 m 1 8 e 80 to describe the nature of the movement and deformation of the drop the dependence of the horizontal size of the drop from time was studied pictures of evolution of a drop in time were obtained a high quality classification of surfacing and spreading of a drop along a liquid border was carried out rice 1 m 0 03 e 20 t 0 0 875 1 675 the number e mainly determines the final equilibrium shape of the drop so with an increase in the number of eths the drop is more flattened the number of morton on the contrary makes qualitative changes to the dynamics of spreading drops so if with the numbers m 1 the graph of the dependence of the position of the drop of the drop from time to time has the appearance of the fading exhibitors then as decreased m fading vibrations appear on it and their initial amplitude grows 42 varying of the density of the drops with fixed t and b leads in the occurrence of waves on the border between the upper and lower liquid fig 1 as the value of the density of the drop to the density of the upper fluid approaches in addition to the spreading phase the swimming phase preceding spreading becomes more noticeable l and t r a trygggvason g bunner b esmaeeli a a front tracking method for the computations of multiphaase flow j comput phys 2001 v 169 p 708 759 2 puckkett e g almgren a s bell j b marcus d l rider w g a high order projection method for tracking fluid interface in variable density incompressible flows j comput phys 1997 v 130 p 269 282 3 gusarov d v chernyshev i v local hydrodynamic fields of the pop up systems in the parabolic stream vestnik volga ser 1 mathematics physics 2006 issue 10 s 75 81 din chung hoa kazan state university dinhtruunghoa yahoo com characterize traces with suspended inequalities denot through mn algebra of all matrices of the nth order above the field c m n m h n are the families of positive and hermite matrices respectively for a b mhn we write a 6 b if 43
