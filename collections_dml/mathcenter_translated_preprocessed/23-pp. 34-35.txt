integral medium and boundary properties of conformal display let is a single link area on a plane that does not coincide with it f is a conformal display of a circle d z 1 on in the modern theory of boundary behavior of conformal display an important role is played by the spectrum of integral medium f t lim sup r 1 log f reiaw td log 1 1 r for good areas f t is a piece of line with t for example f t 0 at 1 t 1 3 the most non trivial spectrum of integral average behaves when has a fractal border the report will consider a new characteristic that is closely related to the spectrum of integral average f t let f locally single leaf and analytical in the circle d z 1 function then log f is also an analytical function in a circle d and can be decomposed in a row icles k 0 akz k uniformly converging inside d the size f t lim sup r 1 k 0 log i 0 t ak rk log 1 1 r let s call proner of integral medium here i 0 x ger 0 x 2 4 1 2 is the modified function of the zero order nub since the log i 0 x x 2 4 then f t will be the final function from t if lim sup r 1 k 0 ak 2 r 2 k log 1 1 r mm 36 the last ratio is performed for any function f analytical and single leafy in the circle d the modified bessel i 0 function in the f t study was first used by kind it was shown that if the log f z a zq k then f t log i 0 at log q the relationship of the characteristics f t and f t will be shown we will prove that f t like f t is a continuous convex function from t further it will be shown that the spectrum f t can be obtained from f t by turning of the log f z coefficients it will also be proved that if the taylor coefficients ak log f z are positive then f t f t with the help of these results lower estimates of the spectrum of integral medium f t will be obtained the work was supported by grant rffif projects no 02 01 00168 03 0100015 and the program of universities of russia v m miklikov volgograd miklyuk mail ru some tasks of the theory of conformal displays of surfaces consider the issues of existence uniqueness and stability of relatively small deformations of conformal display of irregular surfaces some estimates of the relative distance of m a lavrentiev and assessments of the distortion of the area with such display are given applications are indicated to the problem of compliance of the boundaries yu v obnosov kazan yobnosov ksu ru effective characteristics of some periodic multiphase heterogeneous structures in the work considered various dense parquet coatings of the plane physical processes in the corresponding pieces it 37
