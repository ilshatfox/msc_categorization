smirnova st petersburg state university 1 dynamic model describing the movement of spherical microparticles in the near earth space movement in the near earth space okp of microparticles mc with the size of 0 01 100 m characteristic of fine dispersed products of solid fuel rocket engines ttrd is determined by the influence of a whole complex of forces of various physical nature for microparticles with a size of 1 m the most numerous ejection fraction the specified complex of forces includes gravitational forces acting on the mch from the side of the earth s gravitational field as well as the gravitational fields of the moon and sun electrodynamic forces caused by the interaction of the charge of the magnetic and electric fields of the near earth space which are induced on the mch the force of solar pressure the resistance force that occurs during the flow of a microparticle with a stream of background gas a particularly serious problem is the need to take into account the impact on the movement of the mch of electrodynamic forces which is associated with the difficulty of determining the electrical charge of the microparticles which is formed as a result of the process of collective interaction between the mch with the flows of charged particles from the background space plasma and the flows of secondary charged particles issued by the surface microparticles due to the spatial heterogeneity of the parameters of the near earth plasma and the conditions of the illumination of the mch in the okp the electrical charge of the microparticles changes along its trajectory and the value of the charge at a given time is characterized by kolesnikov ek chernov s v the 56 th time of charging mch depends on the physical conditions at the points of the near earth space corresponding to both the current and previous positions of the microparticles on the trajectory therefore in the general case when solving the problems of the dynamics of microparticles the equations describing the process of charging mch in cosmic plasma should be solved together with the equations of the microparticle movement in the okp in the inertial reference system with the beginning in the center of the earth not rotating along with the earth the movement of the microparticle will be described by an equation of 2 0 2 b e gr gr prigons lor lor sd sopr d m dt r f f f f f f f f f 1 forces
