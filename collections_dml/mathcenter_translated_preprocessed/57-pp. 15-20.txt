the best approximations of functions of the nikol skii besov class in the lorentz space by trigonometric polynomials g akishev we consider the lorentz space of periodic functions of several variables and nikol skii besov classes we obtain estimates of the best approximation by trigonometric polynomials with harmonic numbers from a hyperbolic cross of functions from nikol s besov classes in the lorentz space keywords lorentz space nikol s besov class approximations of functions hyperbolic cross udc 517 53 the optimal restoration of a derivative of a limited analytical function of river akopyan 1 1 rrakopyan mephi ru the ural federal university the institute of mathematics and mechanics of the ural branch of the russian academy of sciences solved interconnected extreme tasks for limited analytical functions in the single link area g with the zhordanova hidden border in particular the task of optimal restoration of the derivative at the point z 0 g according to the set 16 materials of the school conference with the error with the limiting boundary values of the function on the measurable part 1 borders on the classroom of functions with the limited unit by the boundary values of 0 1 the task of the best approaching the derivative at the point z 0 g linear limited functionality in lux 1 on the class keywords optimal restoration of functionality the best approach of unlimited functionality with limited analytical functions in the future g is a single bond area of the complex plane limited by the zhordanova hidden curve let 1 the measurable subset of a positive measure 0 is an addition to 1 to i e 0 1 through h g hu g the hardy class of analytical and limited functions is denoted class h g functions are almost everywhere for of non powerful angular limiting boundary values these boundary values make up a function which is determined almost everywhere on and belonging to lip for the density of the harmonic measure relative to the area g at the point z we will use the designation p z accordingly the harmonic measure w z g of the measurable subset of the hidden border relative to the region g at the point z is represented by the formula w z g p z d in h g we highlight the class q functions f that satisfy the inequality f l et 0 1 in this article on class q interconnected extreme tasks for functionality 1 z 0 which in accordance with the boundary values of 1 functions f value its derivative f z 0 at point z 0 g the function of the variable hern 14 determined by the equality f z 0 f q f lu 1 1 is called a module for the continuity of functionality 1 z 0 on class q from definition 1 it follows that for the functions of h g the accurate inequality f z 0 f l least 0 f l least 1 f l least 0 the second is the task of the optimal restoration of the value of the derivative of the derivative of the derivative of the function at the point z 0 functionality 1 z 0 according to the well known error according to the norm of linger 1 by the boundary values of the function to 1 and additional information of the function of the class q more accurately albeit for the unknown function f from class q is a function q linger 1 is such that the inequality is fair f q lurb 1 we want to restore the derivative of the derivative of the function f z 0 z 0 g in the best optimal way as many methods of recovery r from which the optimal is selected we will consider many possible b limited or l linear functionals on lux 1 the formal setting of the problem is as follows for the number hernzeas 0 and the method of restoration t r the value u t sup f z 0 t q f q q lux 1 f q lurb 1 rh akopyan 17 is an error in the restoration of the value at point z 0 derivative of the function of the class q on the boundary values of the function on 1 specified with the error according to the norm linger 1 by method t then er inf u t t r 2 is the value of the optimal restoration of the value of the derivative of the function at point z 0 or the same optimal recovery of the functionality 1 z 0 of class q function their affected boundary values on 1 using the methods of restoration r the task is to calculate the value of er and determine the optimal recovery method the functionality on which the lower line is achieved in 2 with values 1 and 2 the task of the best approximation of functionality 1 z 0 is closely related to linear limited functionality the exact setting of the problem is this let l n have many linear limited functionals in lux 1 the norm of which does not exceed the number n 0 the value u t sup f z 0 t f f q is the evasion of the functionality t l n from the functionality 1 z 0 in the class of functions q accordingly the value e n inf u t t l n 3 is the best the approximation of the functionality of the 1 z 0 by many linear limited functionals l n on the class q the task is to calculate the value of e n and find extreme functionality on which
