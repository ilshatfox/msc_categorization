integration over non rectifiable paths of strong rotation with applications b a kats a number of contemporary publications are deling with transfer of the concept of curvilinear integration on non rectifiable contours and applications of this concept to solving of boundary value problems for analytic functions there are obtained various important results in this field but untill now there known classes of arcs for which satisfactory theory of integration is not developed in the pressent report we discuss recent achievements concerning these problems keywords non rectifiable path strong rotation curvilinear integral cauchy type integral riemann boundary value problem udc 517 53 spectral approach to the regional task of riman d b kats 1 1 katzdavid 89 gmail com kazan volga federal university institute of mathematics and mechanics n i lobachevsky we examine the dependence of the solvability of the homogeneous regional task of riemann on the arc from the spectral parameter the regional task of riman is one of the classic regional tasks of complex analysis see 1 3 and others we give her homogeneous version given 172 materials of the school conference oriented curve and function coefficient g t determined on this curve it is necessary to find the holomorphic in c function z such that t g t t 1 where the t are the limit values of the z for z t on the left and right respectively and 0 if is a curve closed by zhordanov then this formulation means that the limit values exist and the attitude 1 is true to any point t but if is zordanov an arc then we cannot demand the existence of limit values that satisfy 1 in the final points a and b of this arc instead in this work we assume that the required function is limited to points a and b we also include the spectral parameter in the coefficient g of the regional task i e go to the problem t g t t 2 where 0 is a constant multiplier we consider the many s p g of all values c 0 c 0 such that the task 2 has non trivial solutions and call it the problem of the problem 1 keywords riemann s edge task indestructible curves indestructible curve indipinate fractal fractals the work was supported by the rffi grant 18 31 00060 and according to a special program of the russian government supporting research at kazan federal university literature 1 gakhov f d territory tasks moscow science 1977 2 muskhelishvili n i singular integral equations moscow science 1968 3 jian ke lu boundary value problems for analytic functions singapore world scientific 1993 spectral approach to the riemann boundary value problem d b katz we study the dependance of the solvability of the riemann boundary value problem on arc on a spectral parameter the riemann boundary value problem is one of the classical problems of complex analysis let user its homogenous statement we have an oriented curve and a function g t defined on this curve we seek for holomorphic in c function z such that t t t 3 what t are the limit values of z whether z t from the left and from the right respectively and 0 if is a classed jordan this formulation means that limit values exist and rangion 1 t but if is a jordan arc we cannot require the existence of the limit values which satiffy 1 at the ends a and b of this arc instead of this we assume that desired function is bounded at the points a and b we also include the spectral parameter into the coefficient g of the boundary value problem i e we get to the problem t g t t 4 i r kayumov d m khammatova s ponnus 173 where 0 is a constant factor we consider the set s p g of all values c 0 c 0 such that problem 2 has a non trivial solulation and call it the spectrum of problem 1 the research is supported by rfbr grant 18 31 00060 and a special programme of the russian government research at kazan federal university keywords riemann boundary value problem non rectifiable curve non rectifiability fractal udc 517 547 boror inequality for the operator cesaro i r kayumov 1 d m khammatova 2 s ponnusov 3 1 ikayumov gmail com kazan volga federal university institute of mathematics and mechanics n i lobachevsky 2 dianalynx rambler ru kazan volga federal university institute of mathematics and mechanics n i lobachevsky 3 samy iitm ac in the indian technological institute of madras the mathematics department received an analogue of the boror theorem for the cesaro operator operating in the space of functions holomorphic and limited in a single circle the asymptotic behavior of an analogue of the boron amount for this operator was also studied key words boron inequality operator cesaro let d z c z 1 only
