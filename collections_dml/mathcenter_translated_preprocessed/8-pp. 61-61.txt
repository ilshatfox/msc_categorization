direct methods of solving the linear integral equation with a nucleus that has fixed features considered a linear integral equation of the type 1 ax x t 1 0 k t s u s 1 x s ds ds y t 0 t 1 1 where u t tp 1 t q p q r k and y are known continuous functions with certain properties of smoothness of a point nature x is the desired function and the integral is understood in the sense of the final part by adamar many boundary tasks of mathematical physics and the theory of mixed type equations lead to equations of the type 1 since the studied equations are accurately solved only in very rare private cases the development of effective methods of their approximate solution with theoretical justification is of important theoretical and applied importance 2 a number of results in this direction were obtained in 1 where direct methods of solving the equations of the type 1 based on the use of special polynons are proposed and substantiated this message proposes new variants of splainmetodes specially adapted to the approximate solution of the equation 1 their justification was given and it was established that the constructed methods are optimal 2 in order of accuracy in a certain class of the hrph type among all projection methods of solving the equations in some way in a certain space of point smooth smooth functions l and t r a t ralbasov n gabbasov n s new options for the collocation method for one class of linear equations with the adamar integral different equations 2001 t 37 no 1 p 91 96 2 gabdulkhaev b g the optimal approximation of solutions of linear problems kazan publishing house kazan university 1980 232 p 61
