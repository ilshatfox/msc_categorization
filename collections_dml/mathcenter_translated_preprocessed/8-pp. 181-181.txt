the reverse edge task of aerohydrodynamics for the wing profile with a rejected clinter as part of the model of the ideal incompressible fluid solved the task of building an isolated wing profile with a rejected closing according to a given distribution of speed as a function of arc abscissa initially the task of flowing a plate with a rejected shield was first considered its analytical solution was obtained using the christoffs shvartz formula the distribution of speed is determined over the surface of the plate and the shield when the back of the shield according to the hypothesis of zhukovsky chaplygin is the point of flowing of the flow further the resulting speed distribution was modified namely endless and zero speed values at the corners are replaced by the final values according to the modified speed distribution the main reverse edge of the aerohydrodynamics is solved using the quasi free method to fulfill the conditions of resolution 1 as a result smoothly streamlined profiles with a rejected closing were obtained the aerodynamic calculation of the obtained profiles showed that the presence of a rejected click in the profile allows you to improve its aerodynamic characteristics the work was supported by the rfff project 99 01 00365 and the program universities of russia l and t r a t r a 1 elizarov a m ilyinsky n b potashev a v the reverse regional tasks of aerohydrodynamics m nauka 1994 436 p 181
