the regulatory properties of the principle of maxim pontryagin for systems with approximately known initial data of e v trushin nizhny novgorod state university named after n i lobachevsky lenatr bk ru is well known that the principle of maximum pontryagin was the result of the needs of purely applied research during the time after its discovery the theory of the necessary conditions of optimality was significant developed 1 2 nevertheless in the vast majority of works the theory of the necessary conditions in optimal management the tasks of which are exactly from the messenger are considered at the same time the needs of numerous applications inevitably lead to the need to study the tasks of the opalial directorate in situations where their initial data are known only approximately however in this case in terms of classical optimal management it loses its meaning because in the indignant task it is not to exist and in the case of existence it is not entirely in the good way what attitude it has to the initial optimal man of the control of a unperturbed task the situation is cardinal but changes if as a desired element of the theory to consider minimizing sequences of permissible departments the use of minimizing sequences may be considered from uniform positions both the tasks for which their outraged analogues have no classic solutions as well as the tasks with indignations solved in the classic 204 sko sense the use of minimizing sequences is also justified because they always exist conveniently with an applied engineering point of view carry a regulating principle and in fact they are used in essence in the theory of numerical methods of optimal management in the theory of regulators incorrect tasks the report considers the parametric task of optical control i 0 u inf i 1 u 6 p i 2 u q p rk q rl 1 where u d lmool 0 t u t u p v on 0 t u rm compact i 1 u i 1 1 u i 1 k u i 2 u i 2 1 u i 2 l u ii u t 0 fi t x u u t dt i x u t i 0 1 2 x u the solution to the problem of the cat a t x b t u t x 0 x 0 t 0 t x rn the initial data of the tasks 1 satisfy the conditions traditional for the theory of optimal management and are considered to be approximately approximately in this situation the following main ones are discussed 1 the necessary and sufficient conditions for minimizes of the rising sequences 2 the regulatory properties of the principle of the maximum of pontryagin and minimizing after conveying 3 of of the end strife approximation of the task 1 and minimizing sequences 4 minimizing sequences and parametric optimization illustrative examples are considered 205 thank my supervisor of professor m i sumin for setting the task and attention to work the work was carried out with the support of the rffi project 04 01 00460 l and t r a t r a 1 sumin m i optimal management of systems c under close known source data j calculus mat and matte physical 1987 t 27 no 2 p 163 177 2 sumin m i trushina e v the parametric task of the option of systems with approximately known source data bulletin of the nsu series mathematics n novo rod publishing house of nsu 2006 issue fourteen s 114 128 asymptotic spectrum and trace formulas for one operator r z tulkubaev bashkir state university ufa rinattulkubaev pochta ru in the space l 2 0 operator l t v where tf n k 1 k f ising 2 cos kx and v is the multiplication operator on a supply function v x note that t is a square to the ren from the operator lf f generated by the conditions of the neumann f 0 f 0 the spectrum of the operator t consists of numbers k 0 1 2 corresponding complete orthonomated 206
