characterization of traces on algebrah von neumann inequality dinjs chong jung kazan state university dinhtrunghoa yahoo com at all below we will assume that p 2 in 3 it is proved that if for the positive functionality on the adulture of matrices of the nth nth the order for any non negative matrix a b and any 0 1 is the inequality a 1 b p 6 ap 1 bp 1 then k tr where k r and tr is a standard trace this work is devoted to the transfer of this result by the tea of the algebra von neumann afn that is the algebra algebra of all limited 76 operators in the guilbert space closed in the weak opera of the radar topology see for example 1 5 the technique developed in 2 4 is used for afn we will denote through m many positive operators from m determination 1 weighing on afn m is the display m 0 urb with the properties x y x y x x x y m 0 in this case 0 0 for the weight on m through m we will denote the set x m x urb through mart its complex linear shell the set of mpr m projectors with the final weight will be designated through py determination 2 the weight on the algebra von neuman m is called final if e where e is a unit in m normal if supi xi supi xi for any moisture growing limited network xi m semi final if the set of mips ultramosbo is densely in m followed if x x xx for any x m determination 3 two projectors p q m from m are called equivalent if partial isometry u m such that p u u q uu comment let p q non zero orthogonal equivalent projectors from m then algebra generated in p q m p q with the corresponding partial isometry u isomorphic algebra of matrix m 2 c lemma 1 let positive normal functionality on afn m such that p 1 p 2 for any op 77 of the 77 equivalent projectors p 1 p 2 from m then is followed with the help of a remark lemma 1 and the above the sulfate of 3 the following theorem 1 let the normal final weight on afn m if for any operators a 1 a 2 from m inequality 1 then is the trace lemma 2 4 lemma 2 let is a normal semi inferior weight on afn m and for any projector p p s reduced weight in reduced afn mp is followed then is the trace theorem 2 let the normal semi visible weight on afn m if for any operators a 1 a 2 m is performed 1 then is trace to prove the theorem 2 it is enough to apply theo rem 1 and lemm 2 the work was carried out with the support of the russian federation project 05 01 00799 l and t r a t r a 1 kadison r v ringrose j r fundamentals of the theory of operator algebras vol i ii academic press 1983 1986 2 tikhonov o e subadditivity inqalits in neumann algebras and characterization of tracial functional positivity 2005 v 9 p 259 264 3 sano t yatsu t characterization of the tracial property via inqualites j inequal pure appl math 2006 v 7 issue 1 article 36 4 stolyarov a i tikhonov o e sherstnev a n the character of the normal traces of the algebra von neumann is inequal for the module mat notes 2002 t 72 s 228 254 78 5 sherstnev a n elementary theory of the algebr of neumann tutorial kazan publishing house kazan university 1988 the minimum set of groups of isometric of metric spaces a yu dolgonosov nizhny novgorod state university named after n i lobachevsky dolgonosova rambler ru let g a certain group of homeomorphisms of the topologic space x the subset a x is called ginovarian if g a a it is called in the form of unification of the orbits of the group g the non empty closed g invariant subset of the topological space x is called the minimum number of the group group g if the mm does not have the non empty of its own closed g invariant subsets the study of the existence and structure of the mini rash sets of groups of homeomorphisms of direct and districtly is devoted to a series of works by l a beklarian 1 in this work we examine the minimum set of arbitrary group of isometry of the local compact meter applying the results of van danzig and van der wardin from the messengers of 2 we proved the following statement theorem let m a coherent local compact metric space and g an arbitrary group of art meters m then the closure of g x orbit g x at any point x m forms the minimum number of group g 79
