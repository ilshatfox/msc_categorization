non classical convolutions o a ivanova we propose an approach to define a multiplication convolution in the dual to a council limit of weighted spase of entire function variax varias varias this multiplication is introdued with the help of shift operators for the generalized backward shift operator the properties of the obtained algebra of analytic functionals are studied keywords convolution algebra of analytic functionals generalized backward shift operator udc 517 53 multiple regular sets in the spaces of entire functions of the final order of m v kabanko 1 1 kabankom gmail com kursk state university examines the concepts of poorly regular multiple sets in the spaces of entire functions of the final order it is proved that such sets are interpolation sets key words a whole function regular set interpolation task 162 materials of the school conference the term regular set in a complex plane was introduced by b ya levin 1 p 126 it has been proved that such sets are interpolation in the space of entire functions of quite regular growth with an indicator less than the specified manner specified in this specified order this concept was generalized in various directions in particular in 2 the concept of a weakly regular set in the spaces of entire functions of the non mound final order was introduced and in spaces of entire functions of the type no higher than normal relatively unnecessary final order in 3 the concept of a weakly regular set was extended to the space of entire functions of the type no higher than normal relatively zero finite order in all the noted works and works that fell into the vision of the author of this article it was assumed that regular sets have no multiple points however in many tasks of the theory of functions for example when constructing canonical works of sets interpolation tasks many with multiple points have to be considered the aim of this work is to generalize the concepts of regular sets in case of points that have multiplicity other than one we introduce the necessary definitions and designations let f z a whole function m f r max 0 iment 2 f r ei accord through urb we denote the space of entire functions whose order does not exceed 0 that is such as limsup r ln ln m f r lnr let d an qn inous 1 a division i e many different complex numbers an rneiison 1 c along with their multiples qn mmn 1 n by the given division d we determine the measure d z ger n 1 qn z an where delta dirac function we will use the following designation c z t w c w z t a vicious circle with a center at the point z radius t we determine the family of functions d z d c z z qn 0 1 2 where qn is the multiplicity of the division closest to z if such points several then we take a point with the greatest multiplicity if there are several of them any of them for example a point with the largest imaginary part it is not difficult to get the following statement from the cat formula for derivatives if the function f urb then inequality f k 1 z k 1 exp z k n performed with a fixed 0 for all quite large zs z r this inequality leads to the rationality of the introduction of the following definition determination 1 divizer d an qn 1 is called interpolation in space urb if for any sequence of complex numbers bn k mv kabanko 163 k 1 2 qn n purpose satisfying the condition limsup n 1 ln an ln ln sup 1 k qn bn k k 1 there is a function f inous with the property f k 1 an bn k k 1 2 qn n purpose i in such a setting the task of interpolation refers to the problems of free interpolation when minimal restrictions related to the need to obtain a decision in a given class are imposed on the values of the interprooping function in the nodes in the work of k g malyutin and o a bozhenko 4 the necessary and sufficient conditions for the interpolation of the divizer d in the space were found in terms of the canonical work of the division d and in terms of the family of functions d z in particular it has been proved that the divin d is interpolation in the space urb then and only when the ratios are performed for any 0 ger n 1 qn an limsup n ln qn ln an 1 and limsup z 1 ln z ln 1 2 0 d z d 2 note that the task i was considered by g p lapin 5 who studied only the case 0 and received the criteria for resolving the problem i in terms of canonical works lapin considered the task i at the following restrictions on the values in the interpolation nodes limsup n 1 ln an ln ln sup 1 k qn bn k that is in such a setting the task i is not the task of free interpolation we introduce the following definition determination 2 divizor d an qn 1 is called c
