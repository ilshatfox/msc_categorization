the projection and growth scheme for the non stationary movement of the viscous weak minded gas 1 k a zhukov moscow state university named after m v lomonosov moscow built an implicit projection and growth scheme for the linear system of equations that describes the non stationary movement of viscous weak gently in the case of two spatial variables an assessment of accuracy was obtained depending on the parameter characterizing the compressibility of gas and the viscosity of the gas 1 the initial pore task we consider the linear system of equations that describes the non stationary movement of the viscous weak luminous barotropic gas p t k divu 0 u t p u f 1 1 the desired values pressure p and speed vector u u 1 u 2 are the functions of eler s variables t x q 0 t x x y the equation includes function f vector of external forces which is a well known function of euler s variables through k 1 the financial support of the ras program modern problems of theoretical mathematics project optimization of computational algorithms for solving the problems of mathematical physics 141 projection and growth scheme for non stationary movement the positive constant characterizes the compressibility of gas 5 10 is indicated we will consider the gas to be ill impermeable if k 1 the value 1 is a positive constant characterizing the viscosity of the gas the technique of obtaining an assessment of the proximity of accurate and approximate decisions is such that the estimates are uneven in at 0 therefore we assume that the value is separated from zero complete the system 1 1 with the initial and boundary conditions p u t 0 p 0 u 0 x u t x 0 t x 0 t 1 2 below without restriction of community we assume that the function p 0 satisfies the condition for the standardization p 0 d 0 the tasks similar to the task 1 1 1 2 were considered in the work 4 6 8 11 in these monographs various variety schemes were built and the accuracy of the received net decisions were made in the works 2 3 an economical end and based scheme for the task 1 1 1 2 was built and investigated however the end and based approach makes great demands of smoothness to the exact solution semi discrete schemes built by the galerkin method were investigated in 1 where completely discrete projection characteristic schemes are considered which impose smaller requirements for the smoothness of the exact solution in the future we will assume the existence and unity of the generalized solution of the problem 1 1 1 2 while we understand the equality 1 1 in the sense of integral identity p t d k divu d 0 u t d pdiv d u d f d op l 2 and o w 1 2 while u o w 1 2 p l 2 142 k a zhukov 2 the projection and growth scheme let is a limited single link area in the space of r 2 the border s of which is a piece of class c 2 curve and triangulation is set on satisfying the usual conditions of quasi dimensionality the mesh nodes will be called the tops of the triangles of triangulation through h we will denote the totality of nodes belonging to the region we break each triangle with the middle lines into four parts the grid obtained as a result of such triangulation is denoted by h 2 we assume that for each grid all nodes are resettled n th the mesh node xn yn each node xn yn of the h 2 grids we put in line with the function eed x y equal to 1 in this node 0 in all others and linear in each small triangle the node xn yn of the mesh h will put in line a certain large triangle the top of which it is so that various large triangles correspond to different nodes now each such triangle we compare the function n x y equal to 1 if x y belongs to the large triangle and 0 otherwise a lot of linear combinations of pairs of functions onic x y about the final space will find out denote it uh the pairs of functions onic x y form the basis in this space similarly we define the ph space as many linear combinations of the functions n x y that form the basis in this space the expression denotes a scalar work and the norm in l 2 below we will also use the norm u 1 sup eed onic 6 0 u ship and designations u un u x y tn un 1 ut unt 1 un un 1 in order to reduce the record we use the method of finite elements for sampling by spatial variables and the method of final differences 143 projection strife scheme for non stationary movement for sampling by time the resulting discrete solution of the problem 1 1 1 2 we denote q v qt k divv 0 ph vt ship q div iron v icle f icle 2 1 where q and v on each time layer from the spaces ph and uh respectively the initial conditions are set in the form q 0 v 0 p 2 2 where p p 1 0 and are from the solution of the following problem
