the transformation of the airship and some of its applications in the work 1 introduced and studied the generalized discrete prefix fourier which each sequence a l a 1 l 1 a 2 l 2 ap lp lp where ln is material ast text numbers an e 11 puts it in line with a series of fu t l a l esh 1 a t almost periodic p p in the sense of boron function in the darkened works of the author various applications of this transformation to solving integral equations in the average meanings and to solving some problems of the mata are indicated 1 atich physian puting in in in 1 formally t z x i y we get a z la l ei z 2 if a row 2 is an analytical p p function in the strip a y 3 then a z is called the transformation of the conductor vector a l e a if a l e a l 1 in this c 1 uchey rark 2 yav 1 is p p function on a straight line y a vector a l a a 1 belongs to the class 3 a if a e 1 a l e a then unilateral transformations of the conductor l about 3 u and there is a transformation of the conductor those from a l a z a z a z will be an analytical function in the strip about u rz the transformation of the airship will allow you to reduce some of the blessed systems with different indices and the tasks of mathematical physics to solving the problem of riemann for the strip or floor of the village fragrances in k 1 asas of analytical paragraphs p functions 136 work supported by the rffi project 01 01 00720 literature 1 kulagina m f on some endless systems with varied indices i i 1 v universities matem 1992 no 3 p 18 23 a a kungurtsev kazan characteristic tasks with normal derivatives for one three dimensional hyperbolic equation let d o x l o l o z l the existence of the equation in the solution of the equation and z yz ai v e z z civz dizh eiv diz hu f x y z and and and uy they their uyz with the conditions of the gurs 1 u x y u oi x y u x o o o o o o o o o o o z 02 x z u o y z oz y z proved in 1 this message is about the following tasks ggn task find the solution of the equation 1 satisfying the conditions and x y 0 1 r 1 x y u x o z 02 x z their o y z fz y z gnn task find the solution of the equation 1 satisfying the conditions u x y 0 oi x y iv x o z f 2 x z u 0 y z 1 jz y z the task is nnn find the solution of the equation 1 satisfying the conditions u x y o 1 j 1 x y uy x o o o oh z 1 j 2 x z their o y z fz y z 137
