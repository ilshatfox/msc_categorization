amazing extensions of the fields of algebraic numbers amazing expansion of the field of algebraic numbers is any existential closed field in the classroom of all counting underpants of the rings of the adels of this field the main properties of such fields are the justice for them of the local global principle of hasse for entire points of diversity and the properties of maximumness lack of their own algebraic extensions the elementary theory of such fields is complete and permitted algebraic and theoretico model properties of amazing extensions will be described and their application is indicated to build an effective version of the global theory of classes of classes m i kuznetsov n novgorod kuznets unn ac ru o a mular n novgorod milyar mail nnov ru maximum zagalges and automorphism algebr frank over the characteristics field 3 are considered a series of simple exceptional algebr lee is a series of algebr franc t m m n 1 2 3 4 algebra frank t m t has a z 2 grading t t 0 t 1 where t 0 w sl u o t 1 u 1 u is the vector space of dimension 2 o 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 m w w 1 m whether algebra of special differentiations of algebra o theorem 1 let m maximum maximum maximum permanence 3 in t m then either m t 0 the standard maximum subpalgra or m resolved and t m an ignorant m module theorem 2 let g aut t a group of automorphisms algebra t g alge g whether the group g g g 0 g 1 is the corresponding z 2 grading then g 0 sl u o line aut w g 1 t 1 3 17 where t 1 3 t 1 t 3 t 3 the third member of the standard filtering of the algebra t the work was performed with financial support for the rffif project no 0201 00725 l and t r a t r a 1 skryabin s m new series of simple algebris lee matem sat 1992 t 183 no 8 c 3 22 2 knuznetsov m i classification of simple graduated algebrians lee with an inextricable component l 0 metam sat 1989 t 180 no 2 c 147 158 3 chan to us zung about two classes of simple algebris lee over the field characteristics 3 vestn moscow state university ser mathematics and mechanics 1992 no 2 c 12 15 4 brown g on the structure of some lie algebras of kuznetsov michigan math j 1992 v 39 no 7 p 85 90 m v semenova novosibirsk semenova math nsc ru convex geometry the investigation in the lattices of closed subsets and the existence of decompositions of convex geometry is called the scope of the anti reservation x which meets the property of the anti residence x ivil a y a attracts y a x for any closed a x and any x 6 y in x as well as the property through cl x we denote the lattice of the subsets which is closed to the x the next result is classic see for example 1 and 2 theorem 1 for the final lattice l the following conditions are equivalent 1 l isomorphic cl x gment for some convex geometry x gment 2 l semi displayed up and half permissive down 3 each element in l present the only way in the form of an unusual unification of indecent elements i e l has the only non 18
