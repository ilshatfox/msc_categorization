the incomparable elements in the turing degrees of the ershov hierarchy we study the problem of the existence of incomparable elements in the lower cones of turing degrees limited by many from the hererchy of yershov let a nonal turing degree through d a we denote the lower cone of t spons limited by the degree a i e the totality of t spectacles smaller or equal a consider the attendance of the problem of the existence of incomparable elements in the lower cones limited to recursive permitted degrees theorem 1 in the lower cone d a r for any intermediate degree there is r p degree with a incomparable with b this theorem is proved using the priority method with endless violations let the cone d a are limited by the degree belonging to the second level of the ershov hierarchy i e containing the difference in recursive and redesigned sets in this case the analogue of theorem 1 can no longer be proved using only 0 methods suppose that the opposite case is made that is in the lower cone d a there is a degree with a such that for it in the cone d a there are no incomparable elements then the following property is performed theorem 2 let in the lower cone d a r p there is an intermediate degree b comparable to any degree c a then b recursively listed finally the last theorem claims that if the degree a like 54 degrees from theorem 2 exists then it should be quite high in the degrees of degrees below 0 theorem 3 if a is an arbitrary non melted low 2 spectacle containing a n r n set then in the lower cone d a for each p n degree with a exists nr n degree c incomparable with b l and t r a t r a 1 cooper s b the density of the low 2 n r e degrees preprint series leeds 1989 no 16 2 ishmukhametov s on a problem of cooper and epstein j symb log 2003 v 68 p 52 68 n a koreshkov kazan nikolai koreshkov ksu ru on the decomposition of the semi resistant algebra of the associative type in the works 1 2 was introduced into consideration of the lyeevsky type algebra let us give its definition let g a switching group l g g sorted algebra above the field k i e l cho l t g t mm and l l l if t and l l 0 if 6 we will say that l is the lyevsky type algebra if for any t are such k 6 0 0 that if a l b l c l then ab c a bc b ac if 0 for any t then the algebra l will be called the algebra of the associative type just as for associative algebra an ultimately algebra of the associative type will be called semi resistant if it does not have inilpotent ideals and simple if it does not have non trivial bilateral ideals theorem cleaned semi free g g sorted algebra ac 55
