the method of finding polynomials of the best with the weight of the approach 1 v i lebedev rnc kurchatov institute the institute of computing mathematics of the russian academy of sciences moscow introduction the famous articles by p l chebyshev 1 3 about the polynomials of the best approximation mnp of the n th the degree of pn x for continuous functions they opened a new direction in mathematics which then received powerful development in the works of domestic mathematicians subsequently 4 6 numerical methods for finding the pn x parameters based on iterative methods for solving nonlinear like type of equations with a poorly determined vandermond matrix were developed the article contains the formulations of extreme tasks for mnp and extreme polynomials that are the least deviating from zero em with weight w x the smoothness of the coefficient in the residual member for interpolation polynomials of lagrange was studied the error is obtained in the trigonometric form through the phase function n which forms the basis of the iteration method the quadrature formula for the singular integrals with the hilbert core was obtained this formula for em is asymptotic at n for n she along with formulas for zeros and eight currents for error determines the algorithm of joint movement of zeros and edochki when the weight function w x is indignant it rational methods for finding em and mnp parameters are formulated based on the use of reverse analysis methods the theory of disturbances and asymptotic formulas the 1 st work provided by the ras program theoretical problems of modern mathematics project optimization of computational algorithms for solving the problems of mathematical physics and with the financial support of the rffif project no 05 01 00582 4 v i lebedev examples of numerical calculations showed the high efficiency of the proposed proposed method 1 formulation of extreme tasks let f x w x c 1 1 w x 0 on 1 1 weight and f x an approximate function let n a class of material polynomials pn x qn x not higher than the nge degree it is required to find a solution to the next extreme problem find en min qn x n max xicle 1 1 f x qn x w x and pn x arg min qn x n max xorn 1 1 f x qn x w x the solution to this problem exists and only 7 the polynomial pn x will be called the best approximation to 1 1 from f x with the weight w x or mnp let rn x f x pn x w x fair 7 the main theorem of chebyshev about alterninance in order for the polynomial pn x to be least deviated from the function f x c 1 1 with the weight w x it is necessary and enough to exist at least n 2 points 1 mit 2 mit 2 1 called alternannance points in which max x 1 1 rn x with a sequential change in the sign let s call the lection e points from this theorem it follows that at least n 1 points y 1 y 2 yn 1 such as y 1 2 yn 1 mit 2 in which rn yj 0 j 1 n 1 1 1 let x x 1 xn 1 xi 1 1 xi 6 xk n 1 x x n 1 i 1 x xi 5 about the method of finding polynomials ln x x polynomial lagrange of the nth degree for function f x built in terms of values at points x ln x x n 1 k 1 f xk lk x lk x n 1 i 6 k x xi xk xi n 1 x x n 1 xk x x xk then f x ln x x ln x x n 1 x x 1 2 and valid lemma 1 1 if f x cm 1 1 1 m 0 then ln x x cm 1 1 it is known 5 6 that if m n then ln x x f n 1 n 1 1 1 from 1 1 it follows that p yj l yj therefore a lot of a member pn x can be sought in the form of pn x ln x arg min x max xicle 1 1 n 1 x x ln x x w x 1 3 the solution to the problem 1 3 which determines the same polynomial lagrange can be uneatable relative to in cases when rn x has more than n 1 zeros on 1 1 let r 0 and fn 1 f x f x cn 1 1 1 f n 1 x 6 r it is required to find the value en supffn 1 en for this task an extreme polynomial with accuracy to the multiplier will be n 1 x n 1 i 1 x y 0 i arg min x max 16 x 61 n 1 x x w x 1 4 then en 6 en rmin x max 16 x 61 n 1 x x w x n 1 6 v i lebedev is polynomial n 1 x we will call extreme em each of them is the least with weight w x deviates from zero among polynomials n 1 of the degree having a single coefficient at xn 1 the following reverse task has simple solutions let the nth degree pn x be set determine many functions f x c 1 1 for which pn x is mnp for any 0 this set is determined as follows we build two functions g x pn x w x g x pn x w x forming the corridor then pn x will be an mnp for any function satisfying the conditions g x 6 f x 6 6 g x and alternately taking the value of g x g x not less than in n 2 x points let the x cos further then the theorem is valid 1 1 in order for pn x to be mnp it is necessary and enough to find
