triangular oblique schemes for solving the non stationary equation of convection disengage 1 so called subbotina rostov state university rostov on don which was considered in the work the non stationary task of convective diofusive transfer of a substance with dominant convection is a good test example to check the speed of triangular oblique variable schemes and their accuracy of the solution the dynamic task of convective dipuse transfer of the substance in the case of two spatial variables can be written in a symmetrical form taking into account the inconsistency of the medium div v 0 1 ip t 1 pe accord 1 2 v 1 accord v 1 x v 2 accord y v 2 accord x y t ory t 0 0 x y onic d ivil 1 d 0 1 0 1 1 work was carried out with financial support from the rffif project n 00 01 00011 212 so called subbotine in equation 1 v v 1 x y v 2 x y the vector of the speed of the medium the first term corresponds to the dynamics of the task the second term is diffusion transfer and the rest convective transfer f x y t is selected so that the analytical solution of the system 1 is the smooth function lus x y et sin x sin y or a function of the border layer gment pper x y x 10 y 10 t after the approximation of the spatial derivatives of equations 1 on the standard five point template where the convective part is approximated by the central differences we get b yk 1 yk ayk fk 1 k 0 1 2 here a b linear operators matrices in h h the material final free hailbert space f y 0 h y 0 the initial condition yk solution to the problem 1 on the k m in time a a diverse operator in the region of d present the matrix a in the form of the sum of the symmetrical and oblique parts a a 0 a 1 a 0 0 5 a a a 1 0 5 a a a 1 kb kh where kb and kh are the upper triangular and lower triangular matrices let the operator b have one of the following structures 1 b bc 2 kh 2 b 1 2 e kh m m a 0 kb kh 3 b 1 i 2 e kh i n j 1 mij mij elements of the matrix m as shown in 2 the scheme 1 is stable at 0 1 0 5 min max i j kij kij elements of the matrix a 1 min min i i i own numbers operator a 0 schemes 2 and 3 are absolutely stable 2 thanks to the triangular structure of the operator b the solution in the scheme of me 2 on k 1 t step in time is explicitly expressed and does not require the use of numerical methods of solid slau 213 triangular oblique solutions using the selected triangular schemes four tasks with various speed vectors were solved the tasks were solved at the time interval t 0 20 with a step in time the increase in which in the case of the application of scheme 1 leads to a loss of stability for the 2 nd and 3 rd circuits given their absolute stability the step in time is 20 the solutions are obtained on a 32 32 grid in space in the following numbers of peckla 1 pe 10 1 dominant diffusion 2 pe 10 average diffusion 3 pe 103 weak diffusion 4 pe 105 dominant convection tables 1 3 presents the numerical results of the solution of the problem 1 a step in time time spent on solving the problem on the segment 0 20 and the relative error of the solution in the norm of space c at the last step in time numerical calculations confirmed the theoretical results 2 about the conditional stability of the circuit 2 with b bc 2 kh scheme 1 and the absolute stability of the circuit 2 with b 1 2 e kh m scheme 2 and b 1 i 2 e kh i n j 1 mij scheme 3 scheme 1 with dominant diffusion is unstable the age of the influence of convection leads to an increase in the step by time at which the scheme retains stability schemes 2 and 3 are absolutely stable regardless of which of the physical processes dominates and solve the problem for much less time than scheme 1 as expected the error of solving a problem with a smooth exact solution is much less than in the case of solving a border layer with an increase in the number of pe the accuracy of solving a problem with a smooth solution and with a solution of the type of border layer worsens for all three schemes schemes 1 and 3 reach the greatest accuracy on tasks with a speed vector v 1 1 v 2 1 and the scheme 2 on the tasks at v 1 x y v 2 x y and v 1 sin x v 2 y cos x the worst accuracy of all three schemes with v 1 1 2 x v 2 2 y 1 214 so called subbotina table 1 solution of the problem 4 scheme 2 with b e 2 kh vector step by time classifies speed of time sec pogr smooth solution 10 1 unstable v 1 1 10 0 002 329 93 0 18484 v 2 1 10 3 0 016 41 19 0 01225 105 0 016 41 2 0 89566 10 1 unstable v 1 1 2 x 10 0 002 336 47 0 68965 v 2 2 y 1 10 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 022 30 49 0 06948 105 0 024 27 91 0 5173 10 1 unstable v 1 x y 10 0 002 329 83 1 94027 v 2 x y 10 3 0 018 36 69 0 15069 105 0 005 131 88 17 2895 10 1 10 0 3 0 005 140 06 14 8075 1
