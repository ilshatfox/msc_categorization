the strengthening of one theorem about the element of the best approximation is well known see for example 1 theorem a let n the endless subspace in lr a b 1 s r oo in order for the function of 9 o e the functions f e lr a b the best approach in the according to the spaces it is enough with r 1 in the event that time j t is 90 90 t t is almost everywhere different from zero and the fulfillment of the condition is 9 t lf t 9 o t g 1 si 9 p f t 9 o t dt o a for any 9 of n the following theorem v let n is the endless subspace in lr a b 1 s r oo in order for the function of 9 o e having taken the functions f e lr a b the best approximation in the outskirts of n it is necessary and sufficiently the fulfillment of the condition 9 t lf t 9 o t g 1 si 9 n f t 9 o t dt s a b e s 1 si 9 n r 1 j 9 t ldt 1 e 201 dmj of any g of n where e t e a b f t go t o an example has been built showing that equality in 1 is achieved the work was supported by the rfff project 03 01 00080 and propr 1 support for leading scientific schools project nsh 1657 2003 1 literature 1 korneychuk n p extreme tasks in theory with closeness m science 1978 193 p s m sitnik voronezh mathsms yandex ru generalizations of koshi bunakovsky inequalities in spaces with indefinite metric in the works 1 2 generalizations of the inequalities of koshi buna kovsky in integral and discrete forms were obtained for example the clarification of discrete inequality has the form 1 where the middle part a x y is determined by the arbitrariness similar generalizations were obtained for the inequality of koshi bunakovsky in the spaces of minkovsky lorenu with a familiar norm theorem let p p x 5 z o u 5 l yt 0 k i k l then is fair with the middle part a x y from 1 houo t x yk houo j a x y 202
