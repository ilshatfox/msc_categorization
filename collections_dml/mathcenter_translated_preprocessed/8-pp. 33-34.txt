antipromoxyminal sets in direct works of spaces determination a non empty closed subset a 6 x of the material banner space x is called antiprofyminal if there is no nearest point for any point x a in the set a we denote through v x s x single closed ball 33 and the sphere of banakh space x x f x x v x f x sup f z z v x let x y banakh space z x y a direct work of spaces x and y on which the norm is determined satisfying the following conditions x x y y max x x y y c x y z c max x x y y where c 0 is some constant see 1 p 103 definition banah this space z x y satisfies the condition p 1 we will write z p 1 if from the ratios f x x g s y it follows that f g z z in 2 it is proven that in the space of continuous functions c q where q is an endless bicompact there is a limited closed convex antiprotoxymal body this result is generalized as follows theorem let q bikopakk x c q dim x inous y banakh space z x y direct work of spaces x and y z p 1 then in the space of z there is a limited closed convex antiproxy body m the work is supported by the leading scientific schools program project 00 15 96035 l and t r a t r a 1 danford n schwartz j linear operators t 1 m il 1962 2 balagansky v s antipromoxinal sets in the spaces of continuous functions matem notes 1996 t 60 no 5 s 643 657 34
