summarized design models and recursive hierarchies in this work examine machine oracular modeling of second order arithmetic and some of its fragments as well as fragments of the axiomatic theory of sets close to them this means the construction of generalized design models that consist of objects calculated with some oracle in this work 1 through a generalization of the pulsating process proposed by n v belyakin such an ordinal numbering is built that the totality of m total functions computable with the ilistered clinian oracle h e 1 forms a model of arithmetic second order 2 such autonomous relative to e 2 hyper hyper jump is built that the totality of m of total functions gives a model for a two quarter fragment of second order arithmetic 3 it is proved that no e 2 autonomous numbering does not give a model of all second order arithmetic l and t r a t r a 1 gylit e v arithmetic of the second order and pulsating hierar of hiya sib mat journal 2002 t 43 no 1 p 33 40 2 gaillite e v modeling the pulsating process algebra and logic 2003 t 42 no 6 p 641 654 3 gaillit e v arithmetic of the second order and autonomous calculation of the personal sib mat journal 2003 t 44 no 2 p 303 310 48
