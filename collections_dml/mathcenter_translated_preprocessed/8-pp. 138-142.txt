the convergence of the spectral decays of one integral operator in the space l 2 0 1 consider the integral operator af 1 x 0 a 1 x t f t dt x 0 a x t t dt x 0 1 1 138 where a x t x t n 1 n 1 2 6 1 operator 1 it is the simplest of operators some derivatives of the nuclei of which allow ruptures of the first kind on the lines t x and t 1 x with 0 there is equalness of decays on its own and attached functions s p f of this operator and decomposition into a trigonometric series of fourier 1 2 here we get a similar result and in the case of 6 0 it turns out that spectral decays according to s p f operator a is equal to not one but with two trigonometric rows of fourier in a certain way of selected functions we denote through r e age 1 a to the resolventa of fredgolm e a single operator is a spectral parameter for certainty we assume that n even the case of odd n is considered similarly the task of finding r is reduced to solving the following regional problem v n x dv x bf x 2 pv j 0 qv j 1 j 0 n 1 3 where v x v 1 v 1 v 1 x v 2 x t f x f x f 1 x t t transponing sign d 1 0 0 1 b 1 2 1 1 1 p 0 0 1 q q 1 1 0 0 0 theorem 1 if v x satisfies 2 3 and the corresponding homogeneous marginal task has only a zero solution then r exists and rison x v 1 x v 2 x this theorem allows you to obviously find a formula for r and get the necessary estimates consider another regional task u n x du x bf x 4 139 u j 0 u j 1 j 0 n 1 5 where u x u 1 x u 2 x t remove from the thoroughness along with the circular surroundings of the same small radius 0 k k 1 2 in which the conditions of theorem 1 or 1 k or are violated 1 k are their own values of the marginal task y n x y x 0 y j 0 y j 1 0 j 0 n 1 the resulting area is denoted through s 0 theorem 2 for any f x l 0 1 and any 0 1 2 the equality of lim r rf 1 0 where rf 1 2 i r 2 i 1 vi x ui x d and r such that r s 0 v 1 x v 2 x t solution to the problem 2 3 u 1 x u 2 x t solution of the problem 4 5 we will now get the main result theorem 3 let 2 6 1 then for any f x l 0 1 and any 0 1 2 the ratio takes place lim r ger max x sr f x 1 2 r 1 f g x 1 2 r 1 f g x 0 where sr f x partial amount of a number of fourier functions f x according to s p f operator a for those characteristic numbers k for which k r r f x a partial amount of the trigonometric series fourier functions f x for those numbers k for which 2 k n r and r is such that r s 0 g x f 1 x 140 proof according to the theorem 1 1 2 i r r f d 1 2 i r u 1 x u 2 x d rf 6 but 1 2 i r r f d sr f x 1 2 i r u 1 x d 1 2 r 1 f g x 1 2 i r u 2 x d 1 2 r 1 f g x since bf t 1 2 1 f t f 1 t 1 f t f 1 t t therefore the statement of the theorem follows from 6 by virtue of theorem 2 investigation if f x l 0 1 and almost everywhere f x f 1 x then lim r ger max x sr f x r 1 f x 0 if f x l 0 1 and almost everywhere f x f 1 x then lim r max x sr f x r 1 f x 0 the work was supported by the russian federation project 00 01 00075 and the program leading scientific schools project 00 15 96123 l and t r a 1 khromov a p the theorem of equality for the integral operator with a variable upper integration limit meter theory of functions and related issues of analysis collection of articles par the 70 th anniversary of p l ulyanov m publishing house of afc 1999 c 255 266 141 2 kornev v v khromov a p on the equality of spectral decays of one class of integrated operators cons methods in the theory of regional tasks tez dokl voronezh 2000 c 89 v v kostin moscow to the question of restoring the coefficients of the rows according to some orthogonal systems of functions let p pi ger a sequence of natural numbers that are different from 1 let s call a p system or the system of multiplier functions of the price or the system of generalized haar functions see 2 built according to the corresponding p and denote it ther x 0 the behavior of a row according to the p system anaper x is completely described by the martingal sequence of private sums smn x where m 0 1 mn p 1 pn let smn x converge almost everywhere on 0 1 to f x at n how to restore the coefficients of a row on f x in general the question is incorrect since there can be several such ranks so it is necessary to impose additional conditions on a series about
