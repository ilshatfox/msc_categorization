modeling the optical properties of the environment using symbolic mathematics packages and the preparation of demonstration support of a special course on geometric optics t a zhakova tatar state humanitarian and pedagogical university kazan geometric optics is an excellent illustration of differential and riman geometry as well as the theory of ordinary differential equations at the same time it is a practical model for the spread of light rays in optically heterogeneous environments the aim of the work is to create methodological manuals that teach about grams to maintain the methodological base of the course physical picture of the world some demonstration examples of the study of specific cases of the distribution of other rays in optically heterogeneous environments using the maple program are studies of focusing properties and dispersion properties of heterogeneous optical media with cylindrical symmetry spherical symmetry as well as the phenomena of wave interference all these examples also have animated accompaniment obtained using special maple method of animation models based on the use of the plots display command using the insequence true parameter in this case the sequences of the image are preliminarily prepared corresponding to the different values of the dynamic time of the model 95 l and t r a t r a 1 sailor a maple 6 solving the problems of the highest mathematics and mechanics s pb publishing house bhv petersburg 2001 2 ignatiev yu g zharkova t a modeling the optical properties of the environment using packages of the symbolic mathematics and the preparation of demonstration materials for lectures tez dokl ii member scientific conf mathematics education culture togliatti tsu 2005 building a solution to the problem of gurs for the equation of liuville v i zhegalov a a kungurtsev let d 0 x a 0 y b task gursa find the function u x y c d c 1 1 d which is in d by the solution of the equation uxy k exp u k const 1 and satisfying the boundary conditions of u x 0 x x 0 a u 0 y y y 0 b 0 0 2 it is known 1 p 321 the general representation of the decision 1 first half obtained by liwill exp u 2 k x y onic x y 2 3 when constructing formula 3 the functions of ln accord x ln y ln 2 k are used therefore it should be assumed that k 0 x 0 y 0 4 96
