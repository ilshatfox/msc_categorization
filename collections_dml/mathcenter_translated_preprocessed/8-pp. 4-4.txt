the numerical optimization of aerodynamic characteristics by means of suction of the border layer in the work examines the method of controlling the border layer ps through its suction the task is to find the boundaries of the permeable area on a given streamlined body as well as the distribution of suction rate which give an extremum of the aerodynamic characteristics of this body as a criterion of optimality a minimum of either the coefficient of consumption or the resistance coefficient taken as the sum of the coefficient of the viscous resistance of friction and the coefficient of energy costs for suction is selected the calculation of the ps on the permeable surface was carried out by the eppler method 1 the well known pointer program based on the genetic calculation algorithms was used as an optimizer a solution to the problem was found when the distribution of suction rate was modeled with a piece by standing function a comparison of the results with an exact solution based on solving the problem of optimal management is given the effectiveness of the use of sam suction for both laminar and turbulent border layers is shown and to prevent the transition of laminar ps to turbulent the effectiveness of the use of sam suction for different types of distribution of the velocity of the external flow in the diffuser section has been investigated the work was supported by the rfff projects 99 01 00365 99 01 04029 the program universities of russia and the rocr foundation of the academy of sciences l and t r a t r a 1 eppler r airfoil design and data berlin springer werlag 1990 512 p 4
