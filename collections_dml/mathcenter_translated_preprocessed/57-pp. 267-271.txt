the development of hydrodynamic statistical models of the forecast of heavy summer precipitation squalls and tornadoes over the territories of republic tatarstan and of high and middle volga e v perekhodtseva the results of the hydrodynamic statistical forecasts based of different recognition forecast models of dangerous wind including squalls and tornadoes and heavy precipitation over the territories of republic tatarstan and high and middle volga are submitted at this paper the storm warning about these phenomena is given by synoptic to 3 hours ahead the hydrodynamic model forecast is not successful now the phenomena warning is 20 30 these phenomena bring the great economic losses the successful forecast to 12 48 hours ahead allows to reduce the economic losses nowdays the forecast of squalls tornadoes and heavy precipitation used the last statistical recognition models of these phenomena is operative it calculated two times per day for the using in the operative practice as a great effective help to synoptic keywords the territory of republic tatarstan the statistical recognition model the hydrodynamicstatistical forecast the dangerous phenomenon the squalls tornado heavy precipitation the verification by criterion of pirsy obukhov 514 752 514 764 274 517 97 1 2 1 natasha medvedeva volsu ru 2 irina romanova volsu ru m k 268 1 2 3 m n c 2 m m u c 2 u m rn 1 rn 1 m rn 1 r c 2 m c 2 m w m m dm x d x 1 m 1 m 4 1 g gi j n 1 i j 1 gi j 2 i j i j d d 1 2 n 1 i j div m h h m 3 1 w t w mt w 0 m div d t nh x h x dm h x c
