this method is difficult to calculate the so called bots since they often fit completely random data but our development is not designed to solve this problem literature 1 gusarova n f analysis of

work considers the method of describing the behavior of solid media taking into account structural features as an example computed tomography of the diaphysis of the femur of the rat is considered keywords a tensor of structure trabecular spongy bone fabric an ellipsoid structure at present there are many materials that have complex internal architecture and are of interest to research for a quantitative description of the structure of such materials the structure of the structure is used this is a positively defined tensor of the second rank which allows you to take into account the features of the material 1 2 to build a tensor the structure found the application of the average distance msr between the pores 2 4 to use it two methods of processing data obtained using ct threshold binarization of e v were implemented in the work semenova d a mukhin 187 and binarization with a linear site in the first case the threshold of binarization which separates two conventional media is selected from the analysis of the histogram of the sample by the ocu method this algorithm allows you to distinguish from the entire array the so called useful and background values which in the binary of the massif correspond to the values of 1 and 0 in the second case the binarization threshold is an interval determined by the defined parameter and linearly connecting 0 and 1 elements from this interval correspond to the area of bone tissue where the pores are small and the resolution of the tomograph does not allow them to identify but their concentration significantly changes the properties of the material the msr method allows you to get a cloud of points that describes the distribution of one environment in another in the work the regulatory method was implemented which allows to adjust the msr distribution its use is mainly due to two factors the characteristics of the tomograph its resolution and settings and sensitivity to the choice of the threshold of binarization in the work as the initial data computed tomography of the diaphysis of the femoral bone was considered using the considered methodology the structure of the sample was described the data obtained is a vector field of own vectors similarly vector fields were found for the case of binarization with the threshold and for the use of regulatory for the latter the data obtained allow assessment of the axes of orthropia for the studied sample and also evaluating the field of own values you can get information about areas corresponding to greater stiffness for this type of data set standard statistical methods can be applied for example the singular decomposition of the correlation matrix or other factor methods literature 1 shertzer r h fabric tensors and effective properties
