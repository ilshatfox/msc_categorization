the central maximum theorem for the multiplier orthogonal system of functions through n x n 0 1 2 x 0 1 we denote the periodic multiplier orthonomated system of functions abbreviated pmons determined by the sequence of simple numbers pk for a detailed definition see for example in 1 let nk a certain lacunal sequence of numbers subordinate starting with some k condition nk 1 nk 1 k at k 1 2 where k decreases monotonously but not faster to some degree k 0 1 determine the values f 0 0 f k 1 max i ni mk k 0 1 2 bk f k 1 p k max pi 1 i k 1 in 2 the question of the subordination of the sequence ink x interpreted as a sequence of two dimensional random vectors central maximum theorem was studied sufficient conditions for the implementation of the cpt were obtained theorem a in the case when the pk numbers structuring the system are limited in aggregate 151 the next result spreads the theorem a in case limk pk inous theorem if in the conditions of theorem a see 2 the growth of the pk numbers is due to the ratio lnp k o bk b 2 k with k then the subsystem nk x is subordinated to the cpt in the sense of determining from 2 the work was supported by the russian federation project 00 01 00341 l and t r a t r a 1 vilenkin n ya additions to the book of s kachmazh and the city of stein gauza theory of orthoronalny ryads m fizatgiz 1958 2 levizov s v on weak lacunar rows on periodic multiplier systems theory of functions and approaches saratov 1990 part 3 p 5 10 v g leontyev a v potashev kazan optimization of the shape of an arc streamlined near a horizontal screen when designing wing profiles is important is the task of finding a form of a profile that provides optimal aerodynamic characteristics one of the tasks of this kind is the task of determining the wing profile with maximum lifting force the solution to this problem for the handle of a given length and limited curvature was obtained by m a lavrentiev 1 the result of such optimization is a circumference the work is dedicated to the numerical solution of the problem of lavrentiev for arches near the horizontal screen the task is reduced to the search for a control function that delivers extremum to the target functionality when limiting the curvature of an arc by approaching the control function of the segment of the steppe 152
