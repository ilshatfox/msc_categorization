will be addressed will mainly be my joint work with lgiz kayumov and his team results concerning bohr type inequality are motivated by the following two fundamental family of functions namely 1 the family of all bounded analytic functions in the unit disk 2 the family of sense preserving harmonic mappings of the unit disk and the rest are evolved through these by way of generalizing as bohr s phenomenon or by improving the bohr inequality in different setting in this talk an overview on the number of results including recent trend on the classical inequality of bohr will be addressed in particular we indicate solutions to a number of problems on the bohr radius for different spaces of analytic functions a sequence of events led to new problems will be discussed we shall address few unpublished results and discuss some new problems keywords bohr s inequality bounded analytic functions 514 635 4 1 2 1 prokudinala susu ru 2 needleinspace gmail com 1 2 3 x t 273 t b 0 2 x t b 1 x b 2 2 x 2 b 3 3 x 3 b 4 4 x 4 b 5 x b 6 2 x 2 b 7 x 2 b 0 5 24 re 2 fx b 1 refx re x b 2 rem 2 3 40 re 3 fx x fx b 3 re 2 fx n 2 b 4 re 3 b 5 2 refx re x b 6 rem 3 8 re 3 fx x 9 20 re 3 f 2 x b 7 b 6 x t n m x 1 1 1 1990 271 c 274 2 1993 208 c 3 2014 87 1 c 158 166 simulation of wave flow of liquid films in heat and mass transfer l a prokudina d a bukharev a nonlinear partial differential equation for the deviation of the free surface of the liquid film from the undisturbed state in the processes of heat and mass transfer is presented computational experiments were carried out to calculate the wave characteristics of the liquid film frequency increment phase velocity in the process of evaporation and condensation as well as computer simulation of the free surface of the vertical water film taking into account temperature gradients and surface viscosity keywords liquid film wave characteristics free surface temperature gradients 517 54
