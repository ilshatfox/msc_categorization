calculation of electrochemical honyming taking into account the localization zone shkarban a yu kazan state university in the work solved the task of electrochemical honyming taking into account the localization zone of the metal dissolution process an anode border and hydrodynamics of the electrolyte course in the interelectrode gap were calculated electrochemical hinaging is characterized by mechanical and electrochemical effects on the processed surface the mechanical exposure is intended for depassivation on the coated surface the electrochemical effect of allowing g is to refine parts that are difficult to mechanically process the problem is solved in two dimensional production hon tool is a block of metal covered on top and below the isolycies which moves through the workpiece in this work the presence of the process of localization of the process is taken into account it is believed that at a certain distance from the cathode tool the process of dissolution of the metal is painted to solve the problem its hydrodynamic analogy is used the electrostatic field is modeled by the potential course of the ideal inconspicuous fluid which expires of continuously arranged sources of the lower part of the insulation and absorbed by continuously located sources on the upper part of the insulation and at the endless point the stationary task is considered it has a condition of the stationary v cos 8 where 8 is the angle between the tangent to the anode border and the axis of the oh and v is the speed of a fictitious flow like in 1 the problem is solved by the method of the state of speed using the apparatus of the theory of analytical functions to the field of the cracute 264
