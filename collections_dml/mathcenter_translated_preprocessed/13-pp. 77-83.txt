parallel implementation of iterative algorithms for variational inequalities with m matrix d o solovyov kazan state university considers the class of grid variation inequalities which can be recorded in the form of the next system of equations inclusions in rn au b f cu du 1 where a b is m brutal 2 c d are the diagonal maximum monotonous operators of the wrn 3 suppose that submission u cu du and superfillation u cu du of the task 1 1 u exist u au b f au b 4 where u 0 means component inequality then the following theorems of the existence of the solution theorem 1 and comparison theorem 2 1 3 are true theorem 1 when fulfilling conditions 2 4 equation 1 has a solution u for any f rn theorem 2 suppose that assumptions 2 4 and a b have a weak diagonal predominance by columns 5 and also takes place one of the following conditions a a or b have a strictly diagonal predominance by columns or 77 parallel implementation of iterative algorithms b c either continuously monotonous or strictly as monotonous operator or c 0 a b m m a m a weak diagonal predominance for columns if u 1 1 1 and u 2 2 2 are solutions 1 with the right parts f 1 and f 2 note 1 from the theorem of comparison 2 the unity of the solution follows u u u for the task 1 1 let for l 1 2 p a al 0 al 1 b bl 0 bl 1 are the splitting of matrices a b such that al 0 b l 0 are m matrix al 1 0 bl 1 0 next we also assume that al 0 a 0 bl 0 b 0 where a 0 b 0 are diagonal parts a and b let el 0 is also a diagonal matrix and p l 1 el id where a single matrix is indicated through the id consider the following iterative method for solving the problem 1 al 0 v k 1 l b l 0 k 1 l k 1 l a l 1 u k bl 1 k f k 1 l cv k 1 l k 1 l dv k 1 l l 1 2 p uk 1 p l 1 elv k 1 l k 1 p l 1 el op 1 l k 1 p l 1 el k 1 l 6 for k 0 1 2 with initial approximation u 0 0 theorem 3 let the conditions of theorem 2 comparison for the task 1 and for the case c theorem 2 let also split matrices a and b are consistent in the following sense l l 0 al 0 lbl 0 are poorly diagonal branding along columns m matrixes then the iterative method 6 converges for any boss approaching u 0 0 from the ordered interval u u and if u 0 0 u u 0 0 u the sequence uk k k converges monotonously decreasing age to the only solution u of the problem 1 78 d o soloviev will now consider the iterative method such as block relaxation with variable blocks this in particular is the multiplier method of the schwartz for grid variation inequalities recorded in the form of the equation 1 for simplicity we analyze the case when the iteration method is built on the use of only two splitting of matrices a and b let the matrices and vectors be divided into non overturning blocks a aij 3 i j 1 b bij 3 i j 1 c diag c 1 c 2 c 3 id id 1 id 2 id 3 u u 1 u 2 u 3 f f 1 f 2 f 3 determine a 10 a 11 a 12 0 a 22 0 0 0 a 33 b 10 b 11 b 12 0 b 21 b 22 0 0 b 33 a 20 a 11 0 0 0 a 22 a 23 0 a 32 a 33 b 20 b 20 b 11 0 0 0 b 22 b 23 0 b 32 b 33 as well as the diagonal matrices e 1 diag id 1 id 2 0 e 2 diag 0 id 2 id 3 let a al 0 al 1 b bl 0 bl 1 for l 1 2 are two splitting of matrices a b obviously al 0 b l 0 are m matrixes and al 1 0 bl 1 0 consider the following iterative method a 10 k 1 b 10 k 1 k 1 a 11 u k b 11 k f k 1 c k 1 k 1 d k 1 7 vk 1 k 1 k 1 t e 1 k 1 k 1 k 1 t id e 1 uk k k t 8 a 20 k 1 b 20 k 1 k 1 a 21 v k 1 b 21 qua k 1 f k 1 c k 1 k 1 d k 1 9 79 parallel implementation of iterative algorithms uk 1 k 1 k 1 t e 2 k 1 k 1 k 1 t id e 2 vk 1 k 1 k 1 t 10 with initial approximation u 0 0 theorem 4 let the conditions of theorem 2 then the iteration method 7 10 converges for any initial approximation u 0 0 from the ordered interval u u and if u 0 0 u u 0 0 u then the sequence uk k k converges monotonously decreasing age to the only solution u tasks 1 note 2 comparison 2 theorem allows you to prove that the iterative method 7 10 converges no slower than the method 6 when the initial approximation is a sub or superfluousness of the task 1 as an illustration of general theoretical results we consider the system of variational inequalities which
