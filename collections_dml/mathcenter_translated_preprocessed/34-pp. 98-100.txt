one mixed task for the potential of the electric field a a zhidkov nizhny novgorod state university named after n i lobachevsky artem zhidkov telma ru a wide class of physical tasks leads to the study of electromagnetic fields in quasi stationary electric approximation in particular such tasks arise when dividing electromagnetic processes in the atmosphere 1 in the approximation under consideration the maxwell equation system has the form of rot h x t 4 c j x t 1 c d x t t rot e x t 0 div b x t 0 div d x t 4 x t and material ratios are performed see 2 j x t x e x t ect x t b x t x h x t d x t x e x t the solution is sought in the area t x t x r 3 t 0 t it is assumed that the area r 3 is a homeomorphic with a ball 100 layer with the border 1 2 1 2 two components of the coherence of the border each of which is a homeomorphic sphere in r 3 the system under consideration is complemented by the boundary conditions of e 0 bn 0 x the work shows that in this case the task of determining electric fields can be solved regardless of magnetic fields it is also shown that the task in question proceeds the closed formulation in terms of the electrical potential of the following type to predict the function onic x t x t t onic t w 12 t 0 t satisfying the boundary and initial conditions x t 0 x 1 onic x t const x 2 onic x t t 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 integral identity d dt grad onic x t grad x dx 4 x grad x t grad x dx 4 x ect x t grad x dx for all w 12 such as x 0 x 1 x const x 2 it is shown that this task is equivalent to a certain abstract task of the cat with the corresponding choice of the functional space of h the theorem of existence and the only style of solving the problem under study have been proved in the work and some of the inlets of numerical analysis are given 101 thank you to my supervisor of the associate professor a v linin for setting the task and assistance in work l and t r a t r a 1 mareev e a trakhtengets v yu about the problem of electric dynamo izv universities radiophysics 1996 t 39 no 6 s 797 814 2 tamm i e fundamentals of the theory of electricity m science 1976 ledness of controlled systems of differential equations v a zaitsev udmurt state university izhevsk verba udm ru the linear controlled system of differential equations a t x is considered b t u t x u r 1 n m 1 with a piece of line continuous coefficients limited to r control in the system 1 is built as u u t x where u t t r is m n an impact function with limited pieces of unrefined continuous coefficients such controls u t will be called permissible the corresponding closed system has the form of a t b t u t x 2 two systems p t x and q t y are called asymptotitis if it is equivalent if there is a transformation of the lyapu nova x l t y connecting these systems where l t is matrix 102
