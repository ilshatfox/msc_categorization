applications of differential equations in the radio electronics are the main task of radio electronics is the synthesis and ana liz chains these research methods are not complete without races and calculations of the parameters of the chain research for the scope of the parameters of the chain that optimize data about the cessions we are considering the oscillatory contour its differential equation the parameters arising in the solution of the differential equation as well as some others about the steady chains transition processes in electrical circuits and methods of their calculation are also investigated classic differently differential equations operator using the operations calculus the foundations of which are laid by o hevisaid the method of variable state the purpose of the study is to show the advantages and disadvantages of these methods which allows you to expand the possibilities laid down in the program of technical universities where two methods of solving lndu are usually considered the variation method lagranha and the method of picking on the right side all this is linked in the presented message using computer methods of calculating chains 86 e k lipachev a s mokhov l and t r a t r a 1 bakalovv p dmitrukv f krukb i fundamentals of the theory of chains m radio and communication 2000 592 p 2 pontryaginl s ordinary differential equations m publishing house science 1970 332 p 3 ponomarevk k drawing up and solving differential equations of engineering and technical problems m uchpedgiz 1962 184 p 4 popovv p fundamentals of the theory of chains m higher school 2000 575 p 5 garaevk g about some problems of mathematical education in technical universities in modern conditions bulletin of kazan state tech university named after a n tupole va 2000 no 1 s 78 79 e k lipachev a s mokhov kazan volzhsky federal university elipachev gmail com alexphenomenonon 2010 mail ru method for identifying duplicates in various digital collections of physical and mathematical documents of one of the tasks of digital collection management is the search for duplicate documents with the same content in the case of collections including documents with texts in different languages software tools are also needed to find all documents that are translating the same document this task is closely related to the task of identifying borrowings in the scientific pool of liquidations see e g 1 at the same time it is most difficult to find in
