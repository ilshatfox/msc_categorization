the orthogonal vector field that does not possess the carrier in 1 is introduced by the carrier of the orthogonal vector of the field and proved that any ultralabo ishbo continuous vector field has a medium it remained open in the light of the existence of an orthogonal vector field not about the bearer here an example of such a field is given for x x 1 x 2 e l 00 we determine the operator x acting in the hilbert space l 2 according to the formula lfl 212 x x x f 11 f 2 e l 2 then m x x e 100 switching algebra von neym on and many of its orth projectors mri x 7 g with n n let further mo i lih 1 gi breakdown n oppe i l divide fo mo l 2 equality fo x lio where where on a fixed vector from l 2 and i 0 is unambiguously determined by the condition of 1 gio e u here and some ulterfilra long lasting filter freche continuing by continuity fo with j 10 for m we get a claim omem ortogonal vetor fille literature 1 lugovaya g d on the concept of the carrier of the orthogonal age of the torny field 11 scientific notes of ksu 2008 t 150 prince 2 s 71 75
