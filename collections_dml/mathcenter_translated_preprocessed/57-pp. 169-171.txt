approximation in spaces of periodic functions and the riemann hypothesis v v kapustin we discuss approximation statements that aequivalent to the riemann hypothesis about the zeroes of the riemann zeta function keywords approach of beurling nyman to the riemann hypothesis beurling s theorem about invariant subspaces davenport s formula udc 514 822 integration on indestructible arcs of strong torsion and its application b a kats 1 1 katsboris 877 gmail com kazan volga federal university institute of mathematics and mechanics n i in recent decades lobachevsky has appeared a lot of works devoted to transferring the concept of a contour integral to indestructible contours and its applications when solving regional problems for analytical functions in this area important results have been obtained but there are classes of arcs for which a satisfactory theory of integration has not yet been developed this report discusses recent promotions in this area and their applications when solving the regional problem of riman keywords indestructible arc strong twisting contour integral integral of the koshi type the regional task of riman 170 materials of the school conference of the solutions of many regional problems of complex analysis are recorded in the form of contour integrals let us consider as an example the regional task of riman see e g monographs 1 3 this task is set like this let specified on the complex plane c directed curve it is required to find the analytical vc function z which has the limit values t and t on the left and right respectively satisfying the regional condition t in all internal points t t g t where g t and g t specified on functions usually this regional condition is supplemented by the condition of 0 and any restriction on the growth of the desired function at the ends of the arc this is a classic task of complex analysis which has a large number of applications in the classical case the curve of the curve of the solution of this problem is built in the form of integrals along the contour for example with g t 1 the so called task of leap is an integral of the type of cat z 1 2 i g t d t z z since the task also makes sense for indestructible contours the task arises of giving the point to such an integral on indestructible curves and arcs the first satisfactory solution to this problem was obtained in 4 let us give it a brief description let have a simple oriented jordanov arc with the beginning and end a and b respectively with each such arc we will connect the logarithmic core k z the unambiguous branch of the function k z 1 2 i ln z b z a distinguished in c condition k urb 0 in the inner points of the arc of it it the logarithmic nucleus has a single leap and at its ends it can have features of arbitrarily high order further let the function g t jump specified on the arc is a narrowing on this arc with a function with a compact carrier z which is continuously differentiated into c and its product derived in z to a logarithmic nucleus integrate in c to degree more than two with certain restrictions such a function can be built using the whitney theorem about the continuation 5 then the display distribution cures c 7 c k z z z z d z d z d zs in the case of a piece of the arc coincides with the display 7 g t t d t d b katz 171 and therefore can be considered its transfer in case of an indestructible arc with the help of this generalized integral a number of results regarding the edge tasks have already been obtained however it may not exist when the features of the logarithmic core of the arc at its ends have a fairly high order in geometric terms this means that this arc at the ends is twisted in a spiral with a fairly high degree of twisting the report discusses a number of situations when a generalized integral on an indestructible arc manifests itself to determine despite its strong twisting as well as apply to calculating an integral type of cat on such an arc and solving some regional problems on it the work was carried out with the financial support of the russian federation and the government of the republic of tatarstan project 18 41 160003 p a literature 1 gakhov f d regional tasks m nauka 1977 649 p 2 muskhelishvili h i singular integral equations m nauka 1968 513 p 3 lu jian ke boundary value problems for analytic functions singapore world scientific 1993 466 p 4 katz b a zadacharimanan of the opened curve izvestia of universities mathematics 1983 no 12 s 30 38 5 stein i singular integrals and differential properties of functions m mir 1973 342 p integration over non rectifiable paths of strong rotation with applications b a kats a number of contemporary publications are deling with transfer of the concept of curvilinear integration on rectifia contours and applications of this concents
