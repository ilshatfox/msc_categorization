the equivalence of the norms of analytical functions in the appearance of the convex region let d is a limited convex region on a complex plane and g c d through d g we denote the distance from the point to the border d d dist d inf zlex z g let h 0 g the space of functions that analytical in g and disappearing in infinite for 1 2 through b 2 g we denote the space consisting of the functions h 0 g for which the norm is finite g 2 d 2 dv dv dv dv dv 1 2 where dv is an element of the area for 1 2 the space b 2 g will identify with the space of smirnov considering without loss of community that 0 d smirnov s space e 2 g can be defined as a replenishment of space see 1 p polin p 0 0 g p 1 2 ds least where ds is an element of the length of the border arc we introduce the natural number n and through b n 2 g denote the space of functions h 0 g for which n b 2 g in space b n 2 g the norm is n n the main result of this work is the following theorem 1 if 1 2 then there is such a constant c n 0 which does not depend on the region d which is 1 2 1 2 n 6 n 1 1 6 c n n for 1 2 there is such a constant c n 1 2 0 depending on the area d which 1 2 n 1 2 6 n 1 1 2 6 c n 1 2 1 2 thus the spaces b n 1 1 2 g and b n 2 g coincide and the norms in them are equivalent 39 in particular cases this theorem is proved in the works 2 3 we first prove several lemmas lemma 1 with any n and 1 2 the subspace of space b n 2 g consisting of functions analytical on g is everywhere tight in b n 2 g proof for smirnov s space case 1 2 this follows from the definition of space if b n 2 g where 1 2 then take the sequence of tm numbers that decrease to 1 at m and consider the functions m t 2 n m tm g we believe that 0 d obviously m h 0 g and g n m 2 d 2 dv g n tm 2 d 2 dv dv let s replace the variables tm z the varine z runs the area gtm tmg g and obviously d z tm 6 d z tm therefore m 2 n 6 t 2 2 m gtm n z 2 d 2 z dv z since 2 2 1 then m 2 n 6 g n z 2 d 2 z dv z 2 n in addition it is obvious that m evenly on the compacts from g contensing to from these facts in a standard way we get that m is normal in space b n 2 g lemma 1 proven it allows you to prove the theorem 1 and subsequent lemmas only for the functions in g lemma 2 1 the function of the distance d convex in particular subharmonic and satisfies the condition of the lips d 1 d 2 6 1 2 1 2 g 2 if d is differentiated at point 0 then grad d 0 1 3 if d is a convex polygon then d is continuously differentiated in g providence 1 through b z r r 0 we will designate the circle with the center at the point z and the radius r let 0 g and 3 d 0 dist 0 d consider the family of direct l separating the region d from the circle b 0 d 0 and let p 40 the corresponding family of half fluidity containing d then it is obvious that for b 0 d 0 dist d sup dist p since dist p is a linear function d dist d is a convex function let 1 2 g and z 2 d the point of achieving distance d 2 that is d 2 z 2 2 then d 1 d 2 inf zlex z 1 z 2 2 6 z 2 1 z 2 2 6 1 2 since 1 2 equal then d 1 d 2 6 1 2 2 according to the derivatives d in paragraphs in paragraphs do not exceed in modulus 1 if z 0 d is the point of achieving distance d 0 then the derivative of d in the direction 0 z 0 0 z 0 at point 0 is equal to one since the gradient module is equal to the maximum module of derivatives in directions then grad d 0 1 3 the addition to the convex polygon is divided into semi breeds in which the distance is reached on one of the sides of the polygon and to the corners with the vertices in one of the vertices of the polygon in these corners the distance is achieved at the corresponding top of the polygon obviously the function of the distance is continuously differentiated in the insides of the stripes and angles it remains to check continuous differentiation on the boundary rays one of these rays is compatible with a positive part of the ordinate axis so that one of the sides of the polygon lay on the positive part of the abscissa axis let 0 iy 0 y 0 0 to the left of 0 distance d right d im if x iy then on the left of 0 we have dist d x x dist d y y and we get dist d x 0 dist d y 1 thus the first private derivatives on the positive semi shafts of the ordinates are glued lemma 2 proven we prove the right wing theorem inequality for 1 2 we will use the theorem of continuation of the type of whitney see 4
