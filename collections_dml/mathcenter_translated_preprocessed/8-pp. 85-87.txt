the surfaces of the big riman over the big disk are studied by algebraic covers of the big disk locally compact factorization g 0 1 g 0 cylinder g 0 1 where g is compact ableva a group arising as a group of characters of the subgroup rdiscr the latter as you know is isomorphically parametrilized by the group of characters group g a aives each character is a a 0 you can continuously continue on assuming a r a ra g r 0 1 the extreme case of this scheme when rdiscr is the compacting of the boron gave the name to the indicated coverage closely related to the riman surfaces due to the presence of a dense complex structure in everywhere which is generated by immersion into g of the r eucl group which turns g into the solenoid it is significant that the opposite case of the borovsky case z leads to c that is to the riman surfaces itself the construction of analytical and algebraic structures on the bigdisa is based on the existence of the algebra of freche o the elements of which are generalized analytical functions 85 i e functions continuously on functions that are localized by linear combinations of the functions a and 0 in particular subtle sets in i e the closed subset of the zero many functions from o provide the surfaces of the rieman brown branches of branching definition the topological space x is called the surface of the bora riman over the big disk if there are a thin multitude of f and continuous surge p x such that the narrowing p for x p 1 f is an inseparable of the end of the end of the same the surfaces of bora riman naturally arise when studying the question of resolving algebraic equations over the algebra of analytical almost periodic functions see 1 3 the continuation of this topic is the following results theorem 1 let polin polin p xn xn f 1 xn 1 fn are locally quite quite given over the space of continuous functions to then this polin is completely given over o the surface of bora riman generated by polynoma p x is a disjunct association of big discis theorem 2 if the discriminant of the polynoma p x is different from zero on the multitude g 0 then the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface generated by some polynoma of the species xn a where n deg generated p consequence let the group allow division by n if polin p x degree n over o is locally quite given then the surface of the boron riman determined by it can be inflated to the disjunctic combination of the final number of big disks l and t r a t r a 1 bohr h flanders d a algebraic equations with almost periodic coefficients kobenhavn 1937 2 levitan b m almost periodic functions m state texidat 1953 396 p 86 3 grigorian s a gumerov r n kazantsev a v group structure in finite coverings of compact solenoid groups lobachevskij j math 2000 v 6 p 39 46 s a grigoryan r n gumerov kazan the limits of function in the categories of coverage and covering groups in algebraic topology are well known for the following fact if p x g is the cover of a linearly coherent and local linearly connected group g of a linearly coherent space x then in x there is a group structure that turns p into the homomorphism of groups 1 theorem 79 it turns out that for the endless cover of a compact coherent group with a coherent covering space this theorem is also fair this result is based on the fact mentioned above and the theorem 1 formulated below which speaking of the inconspicuous claims that any n lord cover of this group is approximated by the n lis covers of smooth groups let s move on to the exact wording let n cov be a category the objects of which are the n lute covers of compact coherent groups with compact connected connecting spaces morphism between the two objects p x g and q y h of this category we define as pair f x y h g h consisting of continuous display and continuous homomorphism such that q f h p the composition of morphisms is determined in a standard way as in the category of morphisms from the arbitrary category through n cov diff we denote the subcategory in n cov consisting of coverage of groups or in other words subcategoria of groups without small subgroups 2 theorem 1 for each object p n cov there is a controversial function f p n cov from the category of a directed set p such that p is a projective limit f in n cov and f accepts the values of n cov diff 87
