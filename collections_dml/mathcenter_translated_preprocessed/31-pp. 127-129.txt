the methodology for evaluating residual deformation of thin pipes weakened by defects such as dents v v povvalov nizhny novgorod state university valery provalov gmail com one of the common types of defects is a defect such as dent as a result of some exposure the pipe changes the cylindrical shape and plastic deformation remains at the place of deflection experiments have shown that the level of local maximum deformations has a significant effect on the bearing capacity of the pipe during alternating loading in 1 a non destructive method of determining the omeded values of plastic deformations by the thickness of the pipe has been developed but the costs of evaluating using such a methodology are quite large therefore more simple assessment methods may be based on a numerical modeling of the defect formation process the behavior of the material is described by a model of kinematic hardening which according to the experiments quite accurately reflects the behavior of pipe steels the process of defect formation is modeled by the solution to the problem of deforming the shell using mke the solution is carried out by a 4 nodal ke taking into account geometric nonlinearity the integration of the dynamics equations was carried out according to the implicit scheme of newmark 2 128 according to the results of a numerical experiment the dependence of the maximum intensity of plastic deformation on the depth of the dent was built fig 1 rice 1 the dependence of the plastic deformation on the depth of the defect lobes lobashev 1 agishev v n improvement of methods for determining the residual resource of gas pipelines with defects in the shape of the pipes diss cand tech n ufa ufims state oil technical un t 2005 136 p 2 bathe k j finite element procedures prentice hall englewood cliffs 1996 the output of the isotropic dynamically consistent model of the gradient elastic theory 129
