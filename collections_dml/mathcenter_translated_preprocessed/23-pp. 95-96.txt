the solvability of the regional tasks for the stationary equation of the schr dinger when changing the coefficient c x is devoted to the study of the behavior of unlimited solutions to the stationary equation of the schr dinger lu x u 0 1 where c x is a smooth non negative function on an uncompromal diversity m when changing the coefficient c x let m arbitrary smooth coherent non membranous rimano diversity without a edge bk gerk 1 exhaustion of diversity m with smooth boundaries bk b m an arbitrary coherent compact subsets with a smooth border not empty insides and b bk for 97 all k in 1 a sufficiently new approach was proposed to setting marginal tasks on non membranous riman varieties based on the introduction of the concept of class f equivalent on the variety of montless limited functions in this work a generalization of this approach is proposed for the case of unlimited continuous functions f let f 1 x and f 2 x continuous non negative on m functions limited or unlimited we will say that the functions f 1 x and f 2 x are equivalent to m and denote f 1 x f 2 x if for some exhaustion bk ger 1 variety m limk bk f 1 x f 2 x 0 the variety of m will be called l strip of diversity if the m b has a solution to the equation 1 such that v b 1 and v 0 next with equation 1 consider the equation l 1 u u c 1 x u 0 2 where 0 c 1 x c x c 1 x smooth function theorem let on the l string of diversity m for equations lu 0 and u 0 on m b are solved external marginal tasks with boundary conditions from class f then on m b solve the external marginal task for the equation l 1 u 0 with boundary conditions from class f the work was supported by the rffi project no 03 01 00304 a l and t r a t r a 1 mazepa e a regular tasks for the stationary equation of the schr dinger on riman varieties sib mat journal 2002 t 43 no 3 s 591 599 e a mazepa volgograd lmazepa rambler ru orthodox tasks for one class of semi linear elliptical equations on riman varieties in this work studied the issues of resolution in the riman 98
