analytical functions with multiple poles at infinity their application in hydrodynamics considers the external marginal task of the neumann or dirichle for the analytical function w z with the main part f z n n 1 an zn 1 in general it can also have a logarithmic feature similar tasks arise in hydrodynamics when considering the flow of bodies with an indignant flow 1 the solution is found in a parametric form by displaying the area under consideration to the appearance of the circle of a single radius in the auxiliary plane w n n 1 bn n bn n 2 i ln 2 if the displaying function z f then bn coefficients can be determined from 1 by isolating the main part of the function f f the general decision 2 as in the theory of wing profiles is ambiguous therefore a critical point should be set for certainty in particular if one of the critical points coincides with the point 1 then the speed circulation 2 i n n 1 n bn bn 3 the work also proposes a numerical algorithm based on a generalized integral equation of green 1 and the method of boundary elements as an illustration zhukovsky s profile in a stream was considered outraged by the presence of a circular cylinder the radius of which is much larger than the profile chord 73 compared the analytical solution with the numerical as well as with the results of calculating the full task of the flow of the circular cylinder and profile lidentents a 1 terentyev a g generalization of the green formula and use in numerical hydrodynamics tr mezh scientific conf modeling calculations design in conditions of uncertainty 2000 ufa publishing house of uv state aviation university 2000 s 82 89 a a golubev tver on the local properties of harmonic display let d area of the complex plane c w f z d c harmonic display the point z 0 d is called a special point of display f if in any its surroundings f is not bunctional 1 a necessary and sufficient condition for the presence of features at point z 0 is the appeal to the jf jf z fz 2 fz 2 display f at this point the isolated zero of jacobian is answered by the branching points special points of the unstable type in the theory of disasters stable features of smooth display of euclidean spaces are classified in the two dimensional case only two types of stable features are conveyed the folding points and the assembly point of particular complexity is a description of the behavior of non overgrown harmonic display for such displays jf is not equal to zero in the vicinity of the uninsulated zero of jacobian it is proposed different from 1 a method based on the properties of the hopf differential pper dz 2 fzfzdz 2 associated with a harmonic display f the zero jf jf jf jfs unpertured into the points of jf are analytical curves and are called common folds of display f orthogonal trajectory of the holomorphic quadratically 74
