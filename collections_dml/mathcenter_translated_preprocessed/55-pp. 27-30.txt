the structure of dense n k and its calculation a bolshakov 1 a timofeev 2 a v rozhkov 3 1 aleksiosroller mail ru kuban state university 2 caesar 147 mail ru kuban state university 3 ros seminar bk ru the kuban state university studies the thickening of prime numbers their number location on a straight line their applications for the theory of numbers and cryptography are indicated keywords numbers theory computer algebra packages twin numbers simple numbers introduction definition a lot of n simple numbers is called a dense n ko ntuples if they are located on a segment of the minimum possible length the definition is independently introduced in the works 1 2 perhaps this is not the only and not the first works where it is a very natural concept defined a dense n ka is a generalization of well known twins i e simple numbers of the species p p 2 triplets are simple numbers of the species p p 2 p 6 and p p 4 p 6 double twins p p 2 p 6 p 8 further construction of dense nc should be done according to induction the algorithm for building dense n k let the dense n ki be built n 1 ki suppose dense n ki are placed on the segment p p 2 p 2 k length k 1 we consider the segment p p 2 p 2 k p 2 k 1 length k 2 the stage of the divider 3 we consider the numbers 0 2 4 2 k 1 according to module 3 there are two options the number k 1 is divided into 3 then we have two dimensions from the middle numbers from 2 to 2 k we leave those whose remaining of division by 3 equal 1 from the middle numbers leave those that have the remainder 2 if the number k 1 is not divided then we leave those that have the remainder from divisions by 3 equal 0 or k 1 this stage is completed the remaining numbers do not form a complete deduction system according to module 3 and with the correct choice of the initial number p not one of them will be divided into 3 the stage of the divider 5 we consider the number of numbers at the previous stage of the module 5 let s 0 1 2 3 4 0 k 1 mod 5 we take s from s and cross out all the numbers that have the remainder of s and do not touch the rest so we will have 3 or 4 options this stage guarantees us that the numbers will not be divided by 5 with the corresponding choice of the number p the stage of the divider 7 we apply the same method to each version of the previous stage as at the stage of the divider 5 we only replace 5 by 7 etc we carry out deletion until we have exactly n 1 number left and the last stage of the divider will be the maximum simple number that does not exceed the number n 1 with 28 materials of the youth school conference at some stage may turn out that all the remaining ones the numbers are divided into the current divider then we proceed to the segment of the length k 3 and repeat the procedure the algorithm is completed thus dense n ka or k tuples 1 is n numbers by module n n the length of the segment inside which these n numbers are located which i do not form the full deduction system for any simple number p n due to the fact that the calculations have to be carried out according to the ever increasing number of simple modules finding the structure of the n k is a very time consuming task by investing dense nc in each other in the calculation process ideas and methodology set forth in the works 1 2 were used 2 calculations were made using a package of computer algebra gap 4 8 8 the official address http www gap system org it is necessary to record the recording of dense n k since the even number cannot be simple all even numbers inside the length of length n inside which we will omit the dense n ka if some odd place is occupied by a simple number we will mark it with a number 1 and 0 will mean the absence of a number in these designations the blifts mentioned above triplets and double twins will take the form of 2 1 1 3 ki 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 4 ki 1 1 0 1 1 we also give the type of dense n k to n 15 inclusive note that in the standing time on october 2017 only three 21 s were found and not a single 22 5 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 6 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 7 ki 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 8 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 9 ki 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 10 ka 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 11 ki 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 12 ki 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 13 ki 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 a bolshakov a timofeev a v rozhkov 29 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 one 14 ki 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 y
