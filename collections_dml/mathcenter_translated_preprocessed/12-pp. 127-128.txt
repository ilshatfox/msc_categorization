the study of the mixed shape of the loss of stability of the three layer plate which is in the heterogeneous in thickness of the temperature field a a bushkov i i maslov t v polyakova kgsu kpu them a n tupoleva kstu kazan considered the linearized task of the mixed form of stability loss fpu of an infinitely wide three layer plain with a transversal soft aggregate located in a non norce naive temperature field in thickness it is assumed that the lower layer on the ends of the p tastina x o a a the length of the plate is fixed amazingly motionless and the upper layer has a fixed hinge due to the subtleties of these layers the distribution of the temperature of their thickness is accepted uniformly and in the filler it subordinates the linear law t z g zg g t 1 t 2 1 2 g t 2 2 h h 5 z 5 h here 2 h the thickness of the aggregate t t increasing temperature in the supporting layers it has been established that in the pre critical state the initial efforts of 0 tea 01 are formed in the non existing layers f q t 2 o l v 127 where t the thickness of the supporting layer v is the coefficient of 1 luoasson and the coeff is the fitsent of the temperature expansion with such efforts the task is considered it turns out the equivalent task of the mixed fpu of the three layer p astin compressed by axial efforts through one layer which was examined in detail in the article 1 its solution was found on the ba stability equations dedicated to and has the form of et d l 2 1 v 2 where t 1 is an dimensionless parameter of the force and d is the rigidity of the bearing layer to bend literature 1 ivanov v a paymushin in n polyakova t v the updated theory of the stability of three layer structures unearuzed equations of the neutral equilibrium u priestly one dimensional tasks izv universities mathematics 1995 no 3 s 15 24 128
