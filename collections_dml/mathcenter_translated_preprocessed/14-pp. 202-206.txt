the geometric properties of some classes of functions in the circle consider class c 0 6 1 analytical in the circle e z z 1 functions w f z z a 2 z 2 satisfying the condition arg 1 z 2 f z 2 z e 1 class c is the class k almost convex order of functions f z 1 2 distinguished by the condition arg f z g z 2 z e 2 where w g z arbitrary convex in e function since with g z g 0 z ln 1 z 1 z from 2 the condition 1 is obtained therefore all the functions of class c 0 6 1 are single leafy and almost convex in e 3 let f z c consider the complex function f w f g 10 w analytical in the strip d w im w 2 then by virtue of conditions 1 we have arg f w 2 w d on the basis of this it is not difficult to establish see for example 4 that the area f e f d is achievable from the outside of the angles of the solution 1 with bisectors parallel imaginary axis in particular c c 0 and class c 0 coincides with the class of functions 5 convex in the direction of the imaginary axis from 1 it follows that for the functions f z c there is an integral representation f z z 0 p t 1 t 2 dt 3 more than p z p where analytical class in e functions that satisfy the condition p 0 1 re p z 0 z e 208 theorem 1 if f z c 0 6 1 then then in the circle z 6 r there are estimates 1 r 1 r 1 1 r 2 6 f z 6 1 r 1 r 1 1 r 2 4 f z 6 1 2 1 1 r 1 r 1 1 5 z f z f z 2 z 2 1 z 2 6 2 r 1 r 2 6 the assessments are accurate and are achieved for the function f z 1 2 1 1 z 1 z 1 1 proof by force 3 we have 1 z 2 f z p z since p z p subordination takes place 6 p 356 p z 1 z 1 z therefore 1 z 2 f z 1 z 1 z 7 hence for everyone z z 6 r we have an assessment 1 z 2 f z 6 1 r 1 r since 1 z 2 1 z 2 then we get the right from the assessments 4 due to subordination 7 in the circle z 6 r we have 1 r 1 r 6 1 z 2 f z 6 1 r 2 f z from here we get the left of the assessments 4 assessment 5 is obtained from the assessment 4 by integration by the segment of the radius from 0 to r by virtue of the representation 3 z f z f z 2 z 2 1 z 2 z p z p z 8 since p z 1 z 1 z then ln p z ln 1 w z 1 w z where w z satisfies the conditions of lemma schwartz hence z p z p z 2 zw z 1 w 2 z 209 by virtue of inequality 7 w z 6 1 w z 2 1 z 2 for all z z 6 r this means that z p z p z 6 2 r 1 r 2 from where on the basis of equality 8 we get an estimate 6 unrequaling assessments is set by a simple check assessment 6 allows you to easily find a radius of the bulge of class c it is known that the radius of the bulge r 0 of a certain class a of analytical functions f z is called the largest of numbers r 0 r 1 such that for each function f z a image of any circumference z r 0 r r 0 there is a convex curve theorem 2 the radius of the bulge r 0 r 0 c is defined as the smallest positive root of the equation r 4 2 r 3 2 r 2 2 r 1 0 9 evidence by virtue of the assessment 6 we get re z f z f z 2 z 2 1 z 2 6 2 r 1 r 2 hence for all z z 6 r re z f z f z min z 6 r re 2 z 2 1 z 2 2 r 1 r 2 2 r 2 1 r 2 2 r 1 r 2 2 r 2 2 r 4 2 r 2 r 3 1 r 4 1 where r r 0 is the smallest positive root of the equation 9 i e in the circle z 6 r 0 the convexity of the function f z is performed we show that the radius is radius the bulge is accurate for the function f 0 z z 0 1 iz 1 iz dz 1 z 2 c we have z f 0 z f 0 z 2 z 2 1 z 2 2 i z 1 z 2 therefore at the point z ir 0 we get z f 0 z f 0 z 2 r 2 1 r 2 2 r 1 r 2 1 210 tons it cannot be improved we denote through the m class of analytical in e functions w f z f 0 0 f 0 1 such as f z zf z where the function f z c 0 6 1 note that m m 1 where m 1 f z re 1 z 2 z f f z 0 z e and m 1 coincides with the class of typically material functions for this class radius of starship is determined in the work of r liber 7 using the known the relationship between convex and star shaped functions expressed by the ratio f z s 0 f z zf z s we obtain that the radius of the starship of the class m is determined by the equation 9 and with 1 we get the known result 7 r 1 2 5 1 2 5 1 0 345 theorem 2 can be clarified if it is known that the decomposition of function f z in a row taylor has the passes of members in particular if a 2 0 then f z 1 3 a 3 z 2 and p z f z 1 z 2 1 1 c 2 z 2 c 3 z 3 z sher e hence the subordination p z 1 z 1 z taking into account the decomposition p z we get grades p z 6 1 r 2 1 r 2 z p
