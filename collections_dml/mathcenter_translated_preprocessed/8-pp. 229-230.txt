contilest and equal continuity of sequences of probabilistic measures the concept of the continuous sequences of probabilistic measures was introduced in mathematical statistics for the task of distinguishing close hypotheses it is a natural generalization of the concept of absolute continuity of probabilistic measures an important role in the theory of measures is played by the concept of continuity in the direction which naturally coordinates the linear structure of space and measure the work considers a generalization of this concept on the sequence of probabilistic measures let e linear space e some algebra of subset e invariant relative to shifts on elements h e determination 1 1 the probabilistic measure in the space e e is called continuous in the direction of the vector h e if the condition limt 0 a th a is completed for each a e determination 2 let en linear space en some algebra of its subsets and the operation of a 229 hectares on the element hn en is measured n is a probabilistic measure on en n n let s say that the sequence of measures n is equally continuous regarding the sequence of vectors hn hn en if for any sequence of measurable sets an an en the sequence of numerical functions t n an thn is equally continuous with t 0 it is known see 1 that in the event of an endless space the continuity of the measure in the direction of the vector is equivalent to its absolute continuity regarding the measure of the lebag theorem there is no sequence of probabilistic measures n relative to which the sequence of probabilistic measures would be continuously continuous regarding the sequence of vectors hn l and t r a 1 romanov v a on continuous and completely explosive measures in linear spaces dan ussr 1976 t 227 no 3 s 569 570 n n kholshchevnikova moscow analogue of privalov theorem for the multiple rows of walsha in 1923 i i privalov 1 proved the following theorem if the trigonometric series is everywhere except perhaps some closed u nomine converges to the final summified function f then this series is a number of fourier functions f the analogue of privalov s theorem for the walsha system was received by v a skvortsov 2 we turn to the multiple rows of walsha the set of a 0 1 n will be called the valesha n fold rows if it contains n surfaces of the type xi fi x 1 230
