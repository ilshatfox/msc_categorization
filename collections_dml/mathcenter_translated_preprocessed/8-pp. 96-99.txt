the theorems of the coating and distortion for algebraic polynomas methods of the geometric theory of the functions of the complex alternating are applied to inequalities for algebraic polynomas developing the ideas of work 1 we prove new inequalities including generally a free member senior coefficient and extreme values of either a module or a real part of a polynome on a circle or on a segment as an example we give the following result theorem let p z polin degree n with material coefficients normalized by conditions max p z z 1 1 min p z z 1 1 1 then for any 2 the inclusion p z z 1 z 1 tn z z 1 z 1 where is tn z 2 n 1 zn polina chebyshev as the consequences from here well known inequalities of chebyshev markov and bernstein stem from here the strengthening of some modern results for algebraic polynomas was also obtained 2 l and t r a t r a 1 dubinin v n distortion theorems for polynomas for surroundings matem sat 2000 t 191 no 12 s 51 60 2 borwein p erdly t polynomials and polimomial inequalites new york springer werlag 1995 480 p s i dudov saratov about the minimum ball layer containing the boundary of convex compact 1 let d a given convex bodily compact from rp 96 a function n x satisfies the norms for rp then the task of constructing the ball layer of the smallest thickness is normal n with the center from the compact d and containing its border can be written in the form of x r x x min xorn 1 where r x max y x min yorn n x y rp d the function r x is convex on rp and the function x is concave on d thus the task 1 is the task of convex programming in a number of works it was considered for the case when n x euclidean norm for example 1 we take the designations n x subdifferent norm n at the point x k x a a cone of possible directions of the set a at the point x k conjugated cone to the cone k coa convex shell of the set a a b a b a a b b bn x r y rp n x y r inf 0 x a the function of the minkovsky set a qr x d z d r x n x z q x z x n x z x d arg min xorn x kv rp the space of convex compacts from rp 2 here are some properties of solving the problem 1 theorem 1 1 in order for point x 0 d to be a solution 1 it is necessary and enough to make the ratio x 0 k x 0 d 6 where x 0 co n x 0 z z qr x 0 d co n x 0 z k z d z q x 0 2 the conditional superdifferential of the function x at point x 0 on a set of d 2 if the norm n is strictly quasi bass function then the solution to the problem 1 is the only one x d x 0 3 if n x is the euclidean norm then x d x 0 intd 97 4 multiple display x d kv rp 2 r p is a semi intake from above examples show that the solution of the problem 1 may be un unitity and some points from x d may belong to the border of the compact d we also note that if the compact d and the ball of norm n are polyhedra then the task 1 comes down to solving the problem of linear programming 3 for a numerical solution to the problem 1 convex programming methods can be used when implementing the kelly method see for example 2 taking into account the specifics of the task reflected in the subdifferiomic formula 2 of the target function x leads to the following scheme for constructing consistent approaches let the three objects have a three objects dk mk xk at the k m step of the algorithm in it the dk and mk are polyhedra that contain the sets d and bn op 1 and point xk d is the solution to the problem rk x k x min x 3 here rk x max y d wor x y k x min yorn n x y with k 0 the choice of polyhedraries d 0 d and m 0 bn 0 p 1 are arbitrarily we immediately note that the task 3 is reduced to the task of linear programming the transition to the new triple dk 1 mk 1 xk 1 is as follows building dk 1 if xk d then at any point yk q xk we build supporting hyperplosiness yk to d if xk d then we take any point yk d for which d xk n xk yk and find hyperploster yk separating d and bn xk d xk the constructed hyperploster yk along with the faces of the dk polyhedron form a new dk 1 d polyhedron building mk 1 we take any point zk qr xk d and at the point zk xk n zk xk we build supporting hyperpravus zk kbn op 1 98 together with the faces of the mk polyhedron she forms a new multi party mk 1 bn op 1 now as xk 1 we take the solution to the problem 3 for k k 1 theorem 2 any limiting point x sequence xk is a solution to the problem 1 in conclusion we note that for the case when norma n is strictly quasi puppy function the task 1 is equivalent to the task of the best approximation of the compact d of the norm n in the hausdorf metric metric
