some extreme tasks in the class of display with a symmetry of transfer let xt 2 is a class of holomorphic one leaf display f set in the upper half frost and satisfying conditions f z 2 k f z kt k z t 0 and lim im z f z z 0 in the work 1 it is shown that the display f z lim z i where z is the solution of the equation of the type of levner d z d ctg z 2 137 with the initial condition z 0 z and continuous numerical display form a dense subclass in the xt 2 class this allows you to solve extreme problems in the xt 2 class from the levner equation we have f z z e im z 0 y 1 2 d ln f z 2 e im z 0 y d 1 y 1 2 where y y is the control function y 1 for f of a dense subclass the following results take place theorem 1 f xt 2 and z ib are valuable estimates 2 ln 2 sh b 2 im f ib 2 ln 2 ch b 2 th b 2 f ib cth b 2 equality is achieved on the functions of lobachevsky 2 theorem 2 f xt 2 and z ib are fair assessment ref ib ln cth b 2 arg f ib ln cth b 2 l and t r a t r a 1 kopaneva l s the parametric representation of the disposal with a symmetry of transfer issl on the mat analysis and algebra tomsk tsu 2001 s 135 144 in print 2 alexandrov i a conformal displays of half plate in the area with a symmetry of transfer izv universities mathematics 1999 no 6 s 15 18 v v kornev a p khromov saratov on the convergence of spectral decompositions of one integral operator in the space l 2 0 1 consider the integral operator af 1 x 0 a 1 x t f t f t f t t dt x 0 a x t f t dt x 0 1 1 138
