lobachev readings 2019 two series of calculations were held in the first case the contact problem was not solved in the second case the contact element was introduced between the soil and the concrete walls and the separation and slipping between the walls of the pit and the soil was allowed an analysis of the results shows that these calculation options are fundamentally different in the first case the walls diverge to the sides and the maximum bending stretching stresses occur on the inner surface of the retaining walls this is due to the fact that after the excavation of the soil between the walls which in the absence of contact as it were pulled the walls the soil located behind the retaining walls begins to push them apart this does not happen in the case of contact between the walls and the soil and in this case after the soil seizure under the influence of the gravity of the soil behind the walls they begin to bend inside the pit in addition the level of stressful state in this case is much lower the work was carried out with financial support from the rffi as part of the scientific project no 18 31 00419 study of the intection s processes of underground reinforced

gas production industry to determine the fields of a tense deformed state at each stage the so called concepts of structural transforming mechanical systems are introduced the algorithms used in modeling such tasks suggest that at every step of calculation the stiffness of the entire system can change in a jump in this case accounting of the results obtained on the earlier steps of the calculation scheme used which leads to the need to use the geometric nonlinearity of the calculated l a bigaeva i i latypov 25 areas in addition to solve the problems of drilling and installation of wells it is often necessary to use the elastoplastic models of soil even at a low level of external loads in this paper a technique based on a modified incremental theory of lagrange is used when the deformation process is presented as a sequence of equilibrium states at the corresponding levels of loading the determining ratios are introduced in the elements between the true components of the tensors of stresses and deformations in addition the joint calculation of the structural elements of the well and soil involves the contact interaction between the elements of the calculated area for example the calculation of the stress deformed and marginal states of the well of the well trunk in the drilling zone is calculated the calculations were carried out for wells of various depths of drilling and the real occurrence of soils both in elastic and in elastoplastic production the results of the solution of the problem were compared with the results obtained during the monitoring of the well the results of the comparison allow us to conclude about the adequacy and effectiveness of the proposed methodology for calculating the stress deformed and marginal states of the calculation areas which allows us to more accurately and technically competently make design decisions for various stages of construction work the work was carried out with financial support from the rffi as part
