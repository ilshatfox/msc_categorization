affinmeal of measures with the application to the holomorphic functions of b n khabibullin e b menshikova let u least and m least two subharmonic functions in the area d of the complex plane c we explore two related ones but various tasks the first consists in finding the conditions for ris s measures vu and m functions u and m respectively when performing which there is a subharmonic function h least in d such that u h m the second is that the desired function h should be harmonious in d the answers to these questions are given in terms of special affinity of the measures introduced in our previous works the applications of this technique relate to the description of the distribution of zeros of the holomorphic functions f in d which satisfy the limitation f exp m key words subharmonic function measure of risa sweeping holomorphic function sequence of zeros many uniqueness weight class udc 517 956 6 on the periodic task for the equation of a mixed type of the second kind r s khairullin 1 1 xravil kgasu ru kazan state architectural and construction university for an equation of a mixed type of second kind has a task in a rectangular area on the sides of the rectangle the condition of frequency is given on the basis of the value of the desired function on a special line the conditions of gluing are determined the solution to the problem is built in the form of a summary sufficient conditions were found for the given functions and geometry of the region ensuring the existence of a solution the criterion of uniqueness has been established key words strong degeneration an equation of the second kind a periodic task in 1 k b sabitov for the mixed type equation was considered the task of the conductor in the rectangular area to study it a certain analogue of the fourier method was proposed this method was later used in solving other problems including tasks with the condition of frequency 2 3 the purpose of our research is to adapt the this method to equations with strong degeneration in particular articles 4 6 are devoted to the study of the task of the conductor for the uxx yuy y uy 0 1 2 1 354 school materials conferences in the mixed area x y 0 x 1 y where 0 and 0 in this work for the equation 1 the task is considered with the condition of the periodicity on the side sides through n and m we denote natural numbers that satisfy the inequalities 1 2 n 0 1 2 1 2 m 2 it is obvious that m 2 n 2 at 1 2 0 0 and m 2 n 1 at 0 0 1 2 let 1 y 0 2 y 0 the task is p in the area find the function u x y with the properties 10 u x y c 2 1 2 and satisfies the equation 1 in 1 2 20 there are limits from the regions x y i i 1 2 i x lim y 0 u x y i x lim y 0 y u x y a x y i y 2 where a x y i m 2 s 1 2 s i x 1 s s y s n a x y i n s 1 2 s i x 1 s s s y s 2 n 2 i x n n 1 y n 1 ln y n a whole part of the number 0 1 s 1 s 1 and on a special line the conditions of gluing 1 x 2 x 0 x 1 1 1 nose x 0 x 1 3 30 the equalities s i 0 s i 1 s 0 2 m 2 1 4 40 u x y satisfies the condition of the frequency of u 0 y u 1 y ux 0 y ux 1 y y 5 50 u x y satisfies the edge conditions u x 1 x u x 0 x 1 where uction x set functions we put the following conditions on the given functions condition 1 function x belongs to c 2 0 1 c 3 0 1 and equalities 0 ng 1 wor 1 0 1 1 are performed ther 0 ther 1 condition 2 function 2 x belongs to c m 2 1 0 1 c m 2 2 0 1 and equalities onic s 2 0 onic are performed s 2 1 s 0 m 2 1 r s khairullin 355 by the method of separation of variables we build private solutions of equation 1 of the type u x y x x y y that satisfy the conditions 2 5 we get k 2 k 2 k n 0 6 x 0 x 1 xk x xk 1 x or xk x xk 2 x for k n 7 yk 1 y y 0 ger s 0 s k y s n 1 2 s 8 yk 2 y ger s 0 s k y s s s with n 9 yk 2 y n s 0 s k y s n s s 1 n n s n 1 s k y s s n 1 ln y 1 s s rsn with n 10 where z is psi function xk 1 x p 2 sin 2 kx xk 2 x p 2 cos 2 kx 11 theorem 1 let k xk x and yk x are determined by equalities 6 11 then the functions uk x y xk x ck yk 1 y dk yk 2 y where ck dk are arbitrary constant are equation solutions 1 satisfying conditions 2 5 denote k n 0 j k y 1 y 2 y j k 1 y 1 yk 2 y 2 y j k 2 y 1 yk 1 y 2 the theorem 2 in order for the task of the pp out of no more than one solution it is necessary and enough for all determinants 0 k are different from zero through e we denote many of these k for which equality 0 k is performed 0 we will have a formal solution to the initial problem in the form of a row u x y k 0 u
