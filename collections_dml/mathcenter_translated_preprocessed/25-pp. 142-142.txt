achi for differential equations and their connection with the reverse tasks in the report sets out the results on the resolving of ill tank margins for some classes of equations with private derivatives hyperbolic parabolic pseudo of parabolic and pseudo parapabolic equations equations of the constituent type equations with multiple characteristics the tasks are considered with the task as non quarrel conditions for example conditions and x o foi io x or accordingly with linear operators of the po and f 1 and the conditions that are non spatial variables for all tasks under consideration theorems of the existence and uniqueness of regular decisions are proved the so called tents for equations with private derivatives are closely connected with non cabal tasks for cottages in which unknown along with the solution are the coefficients of the equation or the right part the existence of regular solutions of a number of new such problems is also proved by the author the basis for such results is the corresponding results of the author about the resolving of non valuable tasks m yu kokurin yoshkar ola kokurin marsu ru about stable iterative methods for weakly non linear equations with non closed operators we consider the equation ah g x xe n 1 where e l h 1 h 2 g 2 g 2 h 1 t h 2 non linear operator and h 1 h 2 hilberto 142
