sparr interpolation method spaces of sparra 1 is a multidimensional analogue of the well known k method peter its function q act on sets of n 1 a 0 a 1 an the implementation of the sparra method in specific classes of spaces is greatly difficult in the fact that well known theorems about stability analogues of theorem about reiteration for the peter method contain an additional requirement that q k j relatively recently i askritova and n kruglyak 2 146 managed to prove that this statement is fair for the families of banana structures and their retracts thanks to this you can get interpolation theorems for the spaces of besov and lizorkin tribel theorem 1 let urb sj s mm 1 p mm 1 qj q least h 2 j 0 1 2 moreover if the two values of sj are equal to each other then let the corresponding qjs are also equal to each other we put s 2 j 0 jsj 1 p 2 j 0 j pj and let q 1 p s the inner point of the triangle mj 1 pj sj then f sjpj qj rn q b s p q q rn theorem 2 let the two unexplored triangles mj 1 pj sj nj 1 rj uj and vector h 2 are set let the weak conditions t f mj 1 1 f nj urb urb j 0 1 2 are fulfilled for the linear operator t mj 1 p 2 j 0 j pj s 2 j 0 jsj 1 r 2 j 0 j rj u 2 j 0 juj then the operator t bs p q q bu q q if in addition the condition r p is fulfilled then the operator t bsp bur here hn is many vectors 1 2 n for which i 1 0 l and t t r a 1 sparr g interpolation of several banach spases ann mat pura appl 1976 v 99 p 247 316 2 asekritova i krugljak n on equivalence of k and j methods for n 1 tuples of banach spases stud math 1997 v 122 no 2 p 99 115 147
