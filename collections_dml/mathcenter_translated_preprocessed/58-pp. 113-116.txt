a numerical study of the localization of deformation with the slow movement of the bulk environment o i kuzovatova 1 1 oik 17 yandex ru the siberian federal university using the computing algorithm based on the finite elements method conducts numerical calculations of the task of moving the loose environment in a converging channel which confirm the presence of zones of localization of deformations keywords variational inequality diverse environment localization of deformations the method of final elements the initial stress method many natural and artificial materials have significantly different strengths of stretching and compression to describe the stressed state of the bulk environment as a variety of material a medium with plastic ties is used under the influence of compressive or stretching stresses smaller clutch coefficients such an environment is not deformed as the limit of strength reaches the deformation develops in accordance with the theory of linear hardening the rheological diagram of the model is presented in fig 1 fig 1 the rheological scheme is judging by this scheme a fairly additive representation c 0 e here is a tensor of full stresses c the tensor of stresses in contact 0 adhesion tensor e e is the tensor of elastic stresses thousand the tensor of deformations e is a symmetrical positively defined tensor of elasticity modules the tensor c is subject to variational inequality is the dilatania parameter p 2 the intensity of the shift 3 the deformation deviator deformation of the volume the symbol of the crownker given the introduced designations the inequality 1 takes the form e 0 0 c according to the definition of projection this means that c e 1 0 114 lobachev readings 2019 where is a projection operator for a cone according to norm p e consider the structure of the structure made of heterogeneous material which occupies the flat area of the with the border consisting of two non overturning parts u and on the first of which there are no movements and on the second the vector of the distributed load p is set the equilibrium equation in the variation form and the boundary conditions are fair f u d 0 2 u 0 on u n p for 3 the task 2 3 is reduced to the task of the minimum min uc j j u where j u 1 2 0 f u d p ud uc u h 1 u u 0 u c direct calculation shows that j u max uc 0 0 f d p d 2 2 e d from this it can be shown that the field of displacements is identical to zero in the case and only the case if 0 f d p d 0 uc 4 the load f p is called safe if u 0 let p 0 f m f 0 where m is the loading parameter then from 4 we get that the load will be safe when changing the parameter m from zero to the limit value stock coefficient m min 0 d f d 5 this statement is the formulation of a kinematic theorem about the ultimate balance known from the theory of plasticity consider the task of the flat course under the influence of our own weight of the bulk environment in the converging channel it is assumed that in the case of 1 localization of the deformation of a simple shift with dilatance occurs in a narrow linear zone of thickness h inclined at an angle wor fig 2 and case 2 at an angle fig 3 o i kuzovatova 115 fig 2 case 1 fig 3 the case 2 coefficient of the reserve m in this task will be the smallest value of the values of the coefficients m 1 and m 2 for each case respectively with sin accord with a thousand cos p 2 1 formulas for the reserve coefficient 5 for cases 1 and case 2 take the type m 1 2 s g a 1 sin 1 sin cos m 2 2 s g a 1 sin cos here s is the limit limit the analysis showed that the inequality of m 1 m 2 is true at thus the localization zone is directed at an angle ng arcsin 1 p 2 1 6 and corresponds to fig 2 the computing algorithm is based on the finite element approximation of the model the algorithm leads the task of determining the field of movements in a multi resistant environment to solving the sequence of static tasks of linear elasticity with initial stresses with its help maximum loads can only be defined as close as loads the excess of which leads to intensive deformation of the material as an initial approximation in the iteration process the solution of the elastic problem is used the idea of the algorithm consists in replacing the determining equations with an iterative formula n 1 2 3 n e n 1 1 11 0 here const 0 is the projection operator on the cone k p according to the norm 0 p e 1 which acts sl
