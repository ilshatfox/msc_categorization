degenerate resonance in the pendulum systems s a korolev nizhny novgorod state university named after n i lobachevsky korolev s a mail ru the pendulum system is considered with 3 2 degrees of his body with nonlinearity in the form of trigonometric polynoma degrees n 1 n 6 5 and periodic in time non core indignation y n n k 1 pk sin kx a sin t by where pk a b are parameters the frequency of indignation is a small parameter 0 the unperturbed system 0 is a hamiltonic with the function of hamilton h x y y 2 2 n k 1 pk k cos kx and is a two dimensional autonomous system on qi lindra for each phase curve h x y h the phase point is moved from a certain period of the house t h definition the level h x y h 0 is called degenerated if t h 0 t h 0 t j 1 h 0 0 t j h 0 6 0 j 1 while we say that the degeneration procedure is j if t h 0 6 0 then the level is called unpertured 129 proved that in the area of rotational movements the function t h strictly monotonously decreases there are no degenerate levels in this area next only the area of oscillatory movements is considered in this area degenerated levels of different degeneration procedures may exist namely the blowing theorem is fair 1 theorem for 1 n 6 4 the maximum possible degeneration procedure in the unpeerated system is n for degrees of polynoma from 2 to 5 pk coefficients are indicated in which the function t h is non monotonous and has extreme values of the maximum degeneration in the presence of periodic in time of indignation 6 0 degenerate resonances may exist with each n it is possible to have n resonant chains corresponding to the unpertured resonances with the same value of the period of the t the change in the frequency of indignation and parameters a b with the merger of resonant zones and degenerated resonance the issue of the topological structure of degenerate resonance zones is considered depending on the parameter b based on the theory of retic analysis of the average systems 2 a numerical study of poincare s display was also conducted the results obtained are mainly consistent with theoretical in addition a new type of bifurcation is established associated with the formation of vortex steam the work was carried out with the support of the rffi project 06 01 00270 l and t r a t u r a 1 dragunov t n korolev s a morozov a d on degenerate resonances in the equations of the pendulum type bulletin of the university of nizhny novgorod named after n i lobachevsky series 130 mathematics nizhny novgorod publishing house of nsu 2006 issue fourteen s 18 28 2 morozov a d resonances cycles and chaos in quasichonic systems moscow izhevsk publishing house of the rxd 2005 radii of convergence for the rows of the exhibits of o a krivosheev bashkir state university g ufa putinbsu yandex ru let the sequence of complex numbers j j 1 we introduce the value lim j ger ln j j let now denotes the sequence k mk where k is complex numbers such as k urb with k and mk natural numbers through we will denote a vehicle where is a sequence j which is arbitrarily compiled from members of the sequence k so that each point k is found in it exactly mk once we introduce more the size m lim k mk k in addition through we denote the many limiting points of the sequence k k excluding the point k 0 from it if it exists consider a number of exponential monomas i e a number of the species mk 1 k 1 n 0 dk nz n exp kz 1 for the sequence of the coefficients d dk n and we put h d inf limj 06 n 6 mk j 1 ln 1 dk j n k j 131
