about the direction of rbhm and its evolution z ya yakupov r k galimova in the modern world the transmission of information through electronic communication channels as well as processing in any form of information is carried out by means of its coding in the coding in turn the hadamard matrices are used at present it is not known whether there exist hadamard matrices of all orders that are divisible by four finding matrices of higher orders makes it possible to transfer and process information more qualitatively the work is devoted to the study of the hadamard problem the determination of the dependencies between the orders of matrices and the formulas describing them the modernization of a well known list of formulas for expressing the orders of these matrices keywords theory of information coding noise immune coding hadamard matrices reed solomon codes hadamard s conjecture 517 54 1 2 1 damir abzalilov kpfu ru 2 elena shirokova kpfu ru 418 1 2 3 wegmann a n 1 dz l 0 ls ls z zs t zs 0 zs 2 t 0 2 s 0 n z 0 l 0 dz ln d r ei r 1 0 2 0 dz d r ei rn r 1 0 2 0 dz s rsei s s dz s t s 0 n t 0 2 zs t z d rs s s d dz z dz d 0 0 0 dz dz ln z z 1 ln z z dz ln zs t rsei s t n 0 1 i 2 0 ln z r ei z z zs t d s 0 n 1 1 q s t n 0 1 2 0 q k s t d ps t s 0 n 2 419 k s t arg z zs t t ps t n 0 1 2 0 ln z ln z zs t t d qs t arg zs t s t s 0 n q s t m j 1 a j s cos j t b j s sin j t t 0 2 s 0 n 3 2 m 2
