locally convex spaces the calculation of topological bases in local convex spaces is associated with the clarification of the conditions of existence and constructing homomorphisms acting from a given lvp e into some separated lcp the basis of which exists the functional implementation of e as a vector space of continuous numerical functions is considered that is the linear functionality dirac function t x t x t x t e t k t t t t t t t t locally compact space k compact in t theorem let e and f separated by the lvp a e f linear continuous and therefore the slightly continuous display e in f a is its conjugated display which is the weak isomorphism of the space f in e let the many a f e total on e and t a f if e is completely full and f is sideways then a is the topological isomorphism of the spaces e and f a continuous operator reverse for the operator a can be built in this way since t a f e t k there is a weak solution gt a equation a gt t as a result of which equality is fair 136 x t x t x a gt ax gt f gt f f gt f x e thus of the formula x gf f f x e is defined by the linear continuous operator g acting from f to e reverse for the operator a let fi the basis in f and a series mber i 1 ifi converges in the topology of space f then a row i 1 ig fi et i 1 i accord is also related in the topology of space e thus the operator g f e according to the well known base of space f generates the basis in e space f with the basis we call calibration for e l t r a t r a 1 picch a nuclear local spaces m mir 1967 2 kolesnikov a p topological methods in theory with closeness and numerical analysis m publishing house urss 2001 l s kopaneva tomsk some extreme tasks in the class of display with symmetry of the transfer let xt 2 there is a class of holomorphic one leaf display f given in the upper half plate and satisfying conditions f z 2 k f z kt k z t 0 and lim im z ger f z z 0 in 1 it is shown that display f z lim z i where z is a solution to the equation of the type of levner d z d ctg z 2 137
