the geometric description of the areas in which hardy s inequality is fairly the main result of the work is the solution of the well known problem associated with the following variational inequality of hardy in the flat area u 2 2 dx dy c gradu 2 dx dy u cu 0 where is the distance from the point x y to the boundary of this area it is said that is the hardy area if there is a final constant c for which rightly indicated variational inequality it is known that with the local lipshitsky border is the area of hardy there are a number of generalizations of this fact see review 1 however the task of the geometric description of all the areas of hardy remained unresolved we prove the following statement theorem the area r 2 is the area of hardy and only when is a uniformly perfect area in conclusion we note that uniformly perfect uniformly perfect are well known from a number of works on hyperbolic geometry and for them there is a simple description of both the terms of euclidean and hyperbolic geometry the work was supported by the rfff projects no 02 01 00168 03 01 00015 and the program universities of russia l and t r a 1 davies e a review of hardy inqualites the maz ya anniversary collection vol 2 oper theory adv appl 1999 v 110 p 55 67 thirty
