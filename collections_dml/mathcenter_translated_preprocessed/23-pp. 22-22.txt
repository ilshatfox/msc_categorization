incomputability fifty years after alan turing in the fifty years since turing died on the 7 th june 1954 his work on mathematics logic and computer science has continued to exercise a unique influence at the heart of his research was a lifelong concern with questions of computability and in particular the need to find out more about the interface both in the mathematics of the real world and in relation to the human mind between computability and incomputability the existence of unsolvable problems having been discovered of course by turing and alonzo church in the 1930 s in this talk i will review the role of incomputability in turings life and work and examine its enduring impact on current research a facchini padova italy facchini math unipd it direct sum decompositions of modules almost trace ideals and pullbacks of monoids suppose we want to study and describe all direct sum decompositions of a fixed right module m over an associative ring s with identity there is not a natural algebraic structure on the set of all direct sum decompositions of m the way to overcome this difficulty is to pass to consider direct sum decompositions of mn for all n 0 as the direct sum of a direct sum decomposition of mn and a direct sum decomposition of mm is a direct sum 24
