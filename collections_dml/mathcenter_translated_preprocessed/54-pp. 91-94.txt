laplasian levy on an infinite variety of b o volkov 1 1 borisvolkov 1986 gmail com moscow state technical university named after n e bauman discusses the connection of two definitions of laplasian levy on an infinite diversity the first of them is that laplasian levy is defined as the average cesaro of the second derivatives in the direction the second of them is that laplasian levy is defined as integral functionality set by a special type of second derivative interest in laplacean levy is due to his connection with calibration fields keywords laplasian levy endless diversity yang mills equations the original definition of laplasian levy was as follows laplasian levy en l is an infinite laplaxian acting on the functions of f determined in the space l 2 0 1 according to the formula en l f x limn 1 n n k 1 f x ek ek where en is an orthonormated basis in l 2 0 1 another definition of laplasian levy is as follows let the second freche of the functions f was f x u v 1 0 k v x t s u t v s d td s 1 0 k l x t u t v t d t where k v x l 2 0 1 0 1 and k l x linger 0 1 then laplasian levy l can be determined by the formula l f x 1 0 k l x t d t the orthonomated basis en in l 2 0 1 is called slightly evenly dense if limn ger 1 0 h t 1 n n k 1 e 2 k t 1 d t 0 for any function for any function h lux 0 1 an example of a weakly evenly dense basis is en t p 2 sin nt for weakly equal to a number of dense basis en l en l is performed 1 in 1 l akardi p gibilisco and i v in analogy with the second definition of laplasian levy an infinite laplasian was introduced in the space of functions in the space of curves in rd this analogue is also called laplasian levy for such an operator in 1 the following was proved connecting 92 materials of the international school conference in vector states over rd is the solution of the equations of yang mills then and only when the corresponding coherence of parallel transfer is a solution to laplace laplace lapisan levy in 2 r leandra and i v volovich s definition of laplasian levy and the connection theorem with yang mill s equations were generalized in case of diversity in 3 l akardi and o g smolyanova proposed an analogue of the first definition of the original laplasian levy for the case of diversity in this work it is shown that laplasians levy on an infinite diversity are connected by the ratio of similar 2 if e m is a vector stratification the symbol of the plates of the sections in this stratification let m g is a cinger rimanovo single copper variety of dimensions d c rimania metric g let h 1 m 0 1 m the khilbertovo variety h 1 feces on m with the beginning at the point m m let e e m vector stratification over m with a layer cn if p m let ep layer above p in stratification e let e e h 1 m 0 1 m vector stratification on h 1 m 0 1 m a layer of which above h 1 m 0 1 m is the space is the space linear operators from em to e 1 let q t parallel transfer to t m along h 1 m 0 1 m generated by the connectedness of the levi chivites on m let z tm m and h c 1 0 1 r more h 0 0 for curve h 1 m 0 1 m curve z hs h 1 m 0 1 m where s pa for a fairly small 0 is determined by the formula z h s t expense t se t q t z where expp is an exponential display at the point p m let z 1 zd orthonomated basis in tm m we denote the symbol of the pipe of the orthonomated bases in l 2 0 1 such that en c 1 0 1 and en 0 en 1 0 for all n n definition laplasian levy en l is a linear display en l dom venting en l determined by the formula en l onic limn 1 n n k 1 d i 1 d 2 d s 2 s 0 onic zi ek s 2 where dom en l is the space of all sections lus inge for which the right part 2 exists for all h 1 m 0 1 m above h 1 m 0 1 m there are two canonical vector strata 0 h 0 h 1 m 0 1 m and 1 h 1 h 1 m 0 1 m see 4 layer b h 0 over h 1 m 0 1 m is the space h 0 fields along the the canonical rimanova metric in the stratification h 0 is determined by the formula x y 0 1 0 g x t y t d t b o volkov 93 symbol 0 will denote the covariant differentiation associated with canonical coherence in h 0 generated by the coherence of the levi chivita on m layer b h 1 above h 1 m 0 1 m is the space h 1 field x along is such that x 0 0 if x oring 1 and h 1 m 0 1 m then x h 1 fall in t m its covariant derivative is x s dd s x s s x s s where is the characters christophfel of the coherence of levi chivita on m the canonical rimanova metric in stratification h 1 is determined by the formula x y
