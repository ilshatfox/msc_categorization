lagrangean dual problems of variational inequalities 1 i v konnov kazan state university we consider properties of lagrangean dual problems of variational inequalities with nonlinear constraints in general this problem is also a variational inequality at the same time we show that such a dual can be formulated as a concave maximization problem 1 introduction let q be a convex and closed subset of a real n dimensional euclidean space rn g rn rn a continuous mapping and hi q r i 1 m be convex continuous functions then one can define the variational inequality problem vi as follows find a point u u such that g u u u 0 u u 1 1 where u u q hi u 0 i 1 m 1 2 it is well known that in the case where g is the gradient map of a convex function f vi 1 1 1 2 is equivalent to the problem of minimizing f over u or briefly min u u f u 1 3 one of the most powerful and popular approaches to solving nonlinearly constrained optimization problems consists in exploiting duality relationships in fact consider the following constraint qualification c either hi i 1 m are affine or there exists a point u q such that hi u 0 for all i 1 m then we can state the following kuhn tucker saddle point theorem e g see 1 2 1 this work is supported in part by rfbr project no 01 01 0068 and by the academy of sciences of the republic of tatarstan 84 i v konnov proposition 1 1 i if u is a solution to problem 1 3 1 2 and c holds then there exists an element v rm such that w u v is a saddle point of the lagrange function l u v f u v h u 1 4 i e l u v l u v l u v u q v rm 1 5 where h u h 1 u hm u ii if w u v is a saddle point of the lagrange function l defined in 1 4 then u solves problem 1 3 1 2 we also recall that the initial or primal problem is equivalent to min u q sup v rm l u v whereas the dual problem can be formulated as follows max v rm v where v inf u q l u v 1 6 note that the dual problem 1 6 is also an optimization problem more precisely it is a concave maximization problem thus the initial problem 1 3 1 2 can be in principle reduced to the simply constrained problem 1 6 which in fact is a composition of such problems a great number of works were devoted to this approach in optimization see e g 1 3 it is natural to extend this approach to variational inequality problems clearly we can also use the corresponding version of the kuhn tucker theorem as a basis we now recall one of such results from 4 proposition 1 proposition 1 2 i if u is a solution to vi 1 1 1 2 and c holds then there exists a point v rm such that g u u u v h u h u 0 u q 1 7 h u v v 0 v rm 1 8 ii if w u v solves vi 1 7 1 8 then u solves vi 1 1 1 2 85 a note on lagrangean dual problems note that vi 1 7 1 8 coincides with the saddle point problem 1 5 if g f where f is a convex function by analogy with the previous case we can replace vi 1 1 1 2 with the dual problem which can be formulated as follows find v rm such that sup t t v t v v 0 v rm 1 9 where t v t rm t h u u q v 1 10 q v u q g u u u v h u h u 0 u q 1 11 of course both mappings q and t defined in 1 10 1 11 are in general multivalued moreover although t is monotone if g is so t need not be the subdifferential map of a convex function as the following example illustrates for simplicity consider the problem of finding an element u u such that mu q u u 0 u u where u u rn au b m is an n n nonsymmetric positive definite matrix a is an m n matrix q rn b rm then q v can be determined explicitly as follows q v m 1 q at v hence t v am 1 q at v and the jacobian of t is asymmetric in general therefore vi 1 9 does not coincide with the problem 1 6 in this work we show that it is possible to reduce monotone vis to dual convex maximization problems under certain additional assumptions this approach is described in the next section 2 problems with a single constraint for simplicity we consider the strictly monotone case 86 i v konnov proposition 2 1 suppose g is strictly monotone then the mapping q and t defined in 1 11 1 10 are single valued and t is monotone the proof follows e g from 4 corollary 1 let x be a subset in rm and let s x rm be a mapping the mapping s is said to be locally bounded if it maps each bounded set into a bounded set next the mapping s is said to be cyclically monotone if for arbitrary points x 0 x 1 xn in x one has s x 0 x 1 x 0 s x 1 x 2 x 1 s
