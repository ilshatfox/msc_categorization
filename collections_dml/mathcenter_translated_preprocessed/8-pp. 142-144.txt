restoration of the coefficients of the rows according to some orthogonal systems of functions let p pi ger a sequence of natural numbers that are different from 1 let s call the p system or the system of multiplier functions of the price or the system of generalized functions of haar see 2 built according to the corresponding p and denote it ther x 0 the behavior of a row according to the p system anaper x is completely described by the martingal sequence of private sums smn x where m 0 1 mn p 1 pn let smn x converge almost everywhere on 0 1 to f x at n how to restore the coefficients of a row on f x in the general case the question is incorrect since there can be several such ranks so it is necessary to impose additional conditions on a series that ensure its unity they can be expressed in terms of the majority of private sums s x supn edn smn x it turns out that if p is limited i e sup pn then there is a theorem 1 let the martingal sequence of private sums smn x in the p system where p is limited converges almost everywhere to the function f x and has a majority such that one of the conditions is fulfilled 1 there is a sequence that increases to infinity k 1 such that lim k k x 0 1 s x k 0 2 lim x 0 1 s x 0 1 142 then subject to 1 the nth coefficient of this series is restored by function f x according to the formulas an lim k 1 0 f x onic x k dx where k k ms k n ms 1 n ms 1 m 1 0 if the series is considered according to the generalized haar system and k k if the row is considered according to the walsh system and subject to 2 a series of p system is a nearby fourier of functions f x in the sense of a integral proof of theorem 1 is based on work methods 1 where a similar issue is studied for the franklin system theorem 1 covers in particular all the rows of fourier in the sense of the usual integral of the lebeg since any row of fourier according to the psisist even without the condition of limited p satisfies 1 therefore provided that when f x is integrated the corresponding necessary and sufficient conditions for the belonging of a row of the fourier rows for example 1 from the theorem 1 follow from the theorem 1 theorem 1 can also be proved for some generalizations of the anintegra as well as get rid of the requirement so that smn x converges almost everywhere without limitations p the above results are incorrect even if 1 and f x is integrated namely the theorem 2 for any pn system is true such that sup pn is not equal to a number of this system which is identical to zero satisfying 1 and in which smn x 0 is almost everywhere the work was supported by the russian federation project 99 01 00354 and the program for supporting leading scientific schools of the russian federation project 00 15 96143 l and t r a t r a 1 gevorkyan g g majorant and the unity of the ranks according to the franklin system matem notes 1996 t 59 no 4 c 521 545 2 bokaev n a on the uniqueness of the representation of functions 143 with multiple rows according to the generalized haar system matem notes 1996 t 60 no 1 c 127 130 o n kosukhin moscow on the most common fractions of the pad the functions of the type rn z n j 1 1 z aj where aj poles of the function rn z are some points of the complex plane c not necessarily different obviously rn z is a logarithmic derivative of a certain polynomial degree n for point b c and functions f analytical in some single copper vicinity u point b following 1 put z f z z b f d where integration is carried out according to any hidden the paths l b z from this surroundings leading from b to z with n 1 the most rational differential of order n 1 functions f z at point b in some single line vicinity u which f z is unambiguous and analytical or the most common fraction of the n th order of the function f z at point b we call the smallest fraction of rn f b z the order n with the property f z rn f b z o z b n at z b theorem 1 rn f b z coincides with the logarithmic derivative of the partial amount n k 0 ck z b k of a number of taylor function e z at point b theorem 2 let the function f analytical in some vicinity of point b c the positive number r is such that a number of taylor of the e z function with the center at point b converges on the circle z z b r r const 0 r then for an arbitrary compact e z z b r which does not contain the poles of the function f the unrequited inequality of lim sup n rn f b f e r r is performed theorem 3 let f h 1 b 0 z f z 0 r 1 144
