management of groundwater through wells in connection with the problem of maintaining the quality of groundwater is developed approaches to their protection against pollution one of these approaches is the creation of artificial hydrodynamic barriers in the stream of pollution promotion by pumping or pumping fluids into layers through wells the possibility of controlling the flow with a similar method of influence was theoretically studied in the work 1 5 below as in the cited works it is accepted that the wells are located in a homogeneous and isotropic layer of single power where there is a natural stream of polluted groundwater the liquid is inconsistent the valid darcy law the filtration of two dimensional the flow of potential the first section examines the case of the simultaneous operation of operational and injection wells that are imitated by point sources and runoff the second considers the task of the well with a real radius in the stream the method of comprehensive analysis is the boundaries of the areas of the current protected from pollution 1 source and two flow in the stream the filtration flow is considered created by a natural stream with a speed of v and a source and two 254 drains located on a straight perpendicular direction of the flow the distance between the source and drains is equal to l the modules of the source and runoff consumption are equal respectively 2 q and q the filtration course is obviously symmetrically relative to the ox axis this property was used below when constructing the unknown boundaries of that area of the current that is protected from contaminated natural flow at sufficiently large values of q the scheme of 1 of the course is realized see fig 1 a rice 1 curve diagrams of the curve divides the natural flow and the course from the source in the case of scheme 1 the curve consists of two sections 1 and 2 the scheme 2 of the course is implemented at sufficiently small values of q fig 1 b while the contaminated stream breaks between the pair of source stone so that the current from the source and to drain turns out to be hydrodynamically unrelated the complex potential of the course w w z onic i where z x iy has the form w z q 2 ln z 2 l 2 v z 1 next dimensionless values q q 2 v l z z l w w v l are introduced and the strokes are lowered above them from the formula 1 the expression is followed for the current function and from the condition dw dz 0 the equation for determining dimensionless coordinates of the points of zero velocity in the stream n 1 and n 2 see fig 1 a z 3 z 2 q 0 2 using the designations f 1 q q 2 1 27 1 2 q 1 3 f 2 q q 2 1 27 1 2 q 1 3 of the roots of equation 2 in the half plate y 0 can be represented in the form of x 1 f 1 q f 2 q y 1 0 255 x 2 1 2 q f 2 q y 2 3 2 f 1 q f 2 q in the case of scheme 1 point n 1 belongs to 1 and point n 2 section 2 this allows using expressions for the current function to get two equations x 4 x 2 1 2 y 2 2 xy ctg y q y 2 y 2 1 0 3 for 1 and x 4 x 2 1 2 y 2 2 xy ctg y q g y 2 y 2 1 0 4 for 2 where g arctg 2 x 2 y 2 x 22 y 2 2 2 x 22 y 22 y 2 q it should be borne in mind that the equation 3 is also satisfied with the coordinates of the line on which q and the equation 4 the coordinates of the current lines suitable for point n 2 from the source and from the side of the natural flow these lines here are not of interest here by setting the line 1 value 0 6 y y 0 to determine the coordinates of the line and for 2 the values of 1 y qg and by choosing the necessary roots you can build lines 1 and 2 if q 2 then y 0 1 and if q 2 then y 0 is determined by the value y in which two material roots of equation 3 merge into one this corresponds to the maximum on the curve 1 let q q is a critical value of dimensionless flow in which scheme 1 passes into circuit 2 considering that with q q point n 2 lies on 1 we get a transcendental equation for determining q ctg y 2 q y 22 1 y 22 x 42 x 22 1 2 y 22 2 x 2 y 2 5 the initial approximation when solving it should be selected by setting quite small values q having solved the equation 5 we find that q 0 2005 in the case of scheme 2 equation 3 is used where y changes within 0 y 2 q in fig 2 the boundaries lines 1 6 are depicted for values q 2 1 0 55 0 3 0 2005 0 18 2 the injection well in the stream a classic solution to the problem of the source of consumption q in the stream with projections vx v vy 0 1 see fig 3 is known the comprehensive current potential has the form w z q 2 ln z v z 6 from here is the equation of the current line limiting the course from the source x y tg 2 v yq 1 7 256 fig 2 the boundaries separating the contaminated and uninhabited streams of the coordinate x 0 point n zero velocity is x 0 q 2 v obviously point n cannot reach a source but the real well has a radius r about 0 1 m and is of interest to get a solution to the problem of the form of the border for the case of the well on which constant pressure is set see fig 4 for this purpose it is used expressed
