page 18 of how the properties of this group and geometric structure are related 1 we are studying these issues for the orbogodes endowed with affinated connectedness 2 locally n dimensional orbiosity n is a factor space of the n dimensional material space of rn in the final group of dipheeromorphisms the isomorphism of the coordinate surroundings corresponds to the equivalent actions of the same group on rn if points x and y from n have isomorphic coordinate surroundings then they say that they belong to one orbifold type on many points of one orbifold type the structure of smooth diversity is induced thus the orbiosity allows the breakdown k k organo 0 n into smooth generally incoherent k diversity k and the variety n is coherently open everywhere in n such breakdown is called stratification orbits and the variety itself is k k 0 n strata if the n dimensional orbiosity n allows the stratum k k 6 n then n is called its own we have proven that a group of autorphism a n n dimensional orbits of affinity n allow the structure of a dimension group that does not exceed n 2 n we emphasize that the completeness n is not assumed this statement summarizes the famous nomizu theorems as well as hano and morimoto that a group of autorphisms of the n merit variety of affinated 17 connectedness is a group lee the aim of this work is to study the relationship between the dimensions of the strata of the orbits of the affinity coherence and the dimension of the group of its automorphisms it is shown that the dimension of the a n group of n n of the ner orbits of the affinity of n allowing the crama strata does not exceed n 2 n n k k 1 moreover the equality of dim a n n 2 n is achieved when and only when the orbiosity n degenerate into an ordinary flat affection space for their own orbivotes n the inequality of dim a n n 2 is performed and in the case of equality n it does not have a dimension 1 n 2 it was established that on the short circuit ck components of the connectedness ck k dimensional strata k is induced by the structure of smooth cord orbits for which ck is a lot of regular points and the border ck consists of a component of the coherence of the m mortal strata where m k we say that the component of connectedness ck strata k does not adjoin the strategic strategic strategic if for any stratum m orbits n m n the closure m does not contain ck it is proved that in the case of the component of the connectedness ck strap k which does not adjoin the strata of a larger dimension there is an estimate of dim a n n 2 n n k 2 k 1 1 moreover if ck 6 ck then dim a n n 2 n n k 2 k 1 k 2 examples are built showing the accuracy of assessments 1 and 2 eighteen
