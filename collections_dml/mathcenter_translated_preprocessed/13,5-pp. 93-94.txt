the features of some classes of differentiated display let f and x y v x y continuously differentiated display of the region d to d 1 the following is investigated in the view under what conditions of the line on which the jacobian is jia i d u v d x y is zero are not special that is f is local injectively at the points of the curve and at which injection is disturbed at least for some points an example of such display has been built let p x y c a certain family of simple smooth crows located in the area d which the vector function f and v displays in curves with an equal equal apparent form v g u c 1 the function lf x y will call the allied with p x y if the determinant of chjx l jy py l jx is constant in d we will assume that jacobian i is equal to the new functions a p x y and b lf x y in this case and v satisfy the parabolic system of equations and v g u f p x y where f is an arbitrary differentiated function and x y satisfies the uz equation y uy jx a p b lf f 1 p 93 integrating it we get the structural formula of the display and x y o sr j f f cp v x y g u f cp 1 where a 3 f arbitrary rather smooth functions for i x y we have equality i j cf a y fz f the task is solved depending on the multiplicity of the zeros of the multipliers if a sro o then the point sr x y sro special function f transfers it to the point io f cpo vo g io j cpo er sro a line of collapse according to our terminology if j cp 1 o and cp 1 zero of order k then with knoye sr x y p 1 is not special but with an odd line the line ep cp 1 is displayed in the folds of the folds 1 the same situation with the zeros of the multiplier z f in any casket d not containing the line of collapse or prototypes of the folds f v in more particular cases analogues of conformal display were obtained some facts are transferred to the display of the region of three dimensional space literature 1 arnold v i va rchenko a n huseyn zade s m differences and imoy ykh is displayed ii 1 t 1 m science 1982 304 p 94
