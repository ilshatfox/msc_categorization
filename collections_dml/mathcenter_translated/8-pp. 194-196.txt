The multiple incompleteness of the own functions of the beams of ordinary differential operators will be considered in the space of L2 (0, 1) a beam of operators L (λ), generated by differential expression l (y, λ) = y (n) + λp1y (n - 1) (x ) +. . . + λnpny (x) 194 and two -point marginal conditions ∑ s + k = n -1 λs (αjsky (k) (0) + βjsky (k) (1)) = 0, j = 1, n, where pj, αjsk, βjsk ∈ C. Let the roots ωj, j = 1, n, characteristic equation ωn + p1ωn - 1 +. . . + PN = 0 are different, different from zero and lie on one ray emanating from the beginning of the coordinates. Without violating the community, we can assume that 0 <ω1 <. . . <ωn. Let their own values ​​(S.Z.) Board L (λ) are simple and form a counting set. We denote through λ the many non -lwells of S.Z .. Let, in addition, the function y (x) = a1e λω1x + a2e λω2x +. . . + ane λωnx, aj ∈ C, (1) is a beam L (λ) that is generating for its own functions corresponding to S.Z. Of the set λ. Consider the systems of functions yλ = {y (x, λ) | λ ∈ λ}, yc = {y (x, λ) | λ ∈ C}. Earlier, the author established that the YC system is not a N-compliant in any space L2 (0, σ), where σ> 0, and has an infinite defect (in the case of σ> 1, the function y (x) is considered continued for the segment [ 0, 1] by the formula (1)). Hence, in particular, a similar statement follows for the Yλ. It turns out that with some ratios between the parameters of the beam L (λ) there is a stronger result. Theorem. If | A1 | √ ω1 + | A2 | √ ω2 +. . . + | an-1 | √ ωn-1 <| an | √ ωn, (2) then the YC system is not 2-fold in any space L2 (0, σ) with σ> 0 and has an infinite defect. Consequence. If the condition (2) is fulfilled, then whatever the set λ, the Yλ system is 2-fold full of 195 in any space L2 (0, σ) with σ> 0 and has an endless defect. The work was supported by the Russian Federation (project 00-01-00075) and the program “Leading Scientific Schools” (project 00-15-96123). T. N. Saburova (Moscow) about the absolute convergence of the ranks of the Fourier coefficients according to bases such as Faber-Shauder is well known that the Faber-Shauder system uction (BFSh) is the basis in C [0.1]. It is generated by one function С С ϕ2 (): if m = 2k + l, then onic = onic (2kx - (l - 1)), while it is assumed that Сory (x) is zero outside of the segment [0.1]. Following the same algorithm, you can build GM (x) systems generated by the function G (x), and if G (x) satisfies certain conditions (see, for example, [1]), then this system also forms the basis in with [ 0.1] (BTFSHG-a basis of the Faber-Shauder type generated by G (X)). We denote the AG class of continuous functions, in which a number of Fourier coefficients in BTFSHG are absolutely converged. Theorem. If for the factors Fourier according to BTFSHG functions t (x) the rating is fair | AM (t, G) | ≤ cα22k (m = 2k + l, l = 1 ... 2k, m> 2, α> 1) and Cα <2α−1 - 1, then ag = at. Note 1. This condition is only sufficient, but not necessary. So the function T1 (x) = 4x (1– x) generates the Shaidukov base in C [0.1] (BS) and AT1 = Aware, however, theorem 1 for the factors of Fourier according to the BFSh function T1 (X) are not performed. Note 2. Take as the initial basis of the BFSH, while a consequence of theorem 1 will receive: if g ′ ′ (x) ∈C [0.1] and max | g ′ ′ | <8, then ag = a accord. Note 3. Take it as the initial basis of the BS, TOG 196
