The optimal control of the movement of the vibration in the viscous fluid 73 is a drin that is not a non -stationary NRAMOLINSOM METHOD in the vibrobot fluid - the Dnuhmas system consisting of spherical case. and mobile inner mass. By controlling the movement of the inner body, you can control the external SNLII, acting on the body and, as a result, movement! \! Systems as T ~ ELOGO. The task is to find 01111111111111111s, it is • RAYUSHOGOM MPURIL Energy • Early costs at: ~ Alappa of the average velocity of the trp nibrobrobot and a fixeronapper period of oscillations. Until now, this and similar tasks were solved 11, 2] in the conditions of quasi stations, when the resistance forces were determined only by the mug speed of the corps. 13 of this work in the forces of the conjuvenular1 R. In addition to the quadratic in speed of viscous forces, the power of the power of the Baeshe: R = -SZ -7TFNSSHIL + 67TRVA2 dT DU/DT 2 -OOO J1GV (t -t) are also and are also and also.

With an increase of S, the character of optimal dreysen is maintained, and the effectiveness of the movement is smart, which is the increase in the energy costs of overcoming the forces of the bass.
