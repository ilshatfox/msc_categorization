) The regularity of operators associated with the regional tasks for the holomorphic functions 2 1. Introduction, this work is an overview of the results of the study of the regularity of operators related to the regional tasks for the holomorphic functions, regarding the functional parameters of these tasks. In particular, the regularity in some banich spaces of a number of integral operators relative to the integration circuit was studied. This topic is significantly based on the classical results on the theory of regional tasks for the holomorphic functions presented in known monographs and overview articles [8], [10], [13], [29], [32]. The well -known results are also used about the regularity of conformal display and single -leafful functions ([4], [37], etc.), the results can have applications to the tasks of hydrodynamics (see, for example, [5], [30]), in the study of the regularity of free free free borders in the tasks of the theory of filtration (see, for example, [6], [39], [40]), as well as when studying the effective properties of composite materials (see, for example, [1], [3], [31])) . The proposed approach dates back to the classical work of T. Roy [37] about the continuity of the conformal display relative to the boundary curve in uniform metric. Closed to the results we are considering were obtained by R. Koifman and I. Meyer [16], as well as S. Wu [7], who studied the regularity of the operator associated with the conformal display of Lavrentiev’s regions in relation to the boundary curve. Within the framework of the present, Leonid Aksentieva is 2-bit of Leonid Aleksandrovich in connection with his 70th anniversary of 185 of the approach, the properties of the regularity of the singular integral operator established by A.P. are substantially used. Calderon [14] and G. David [11], as well as the properties of the superposition operator, described, for example, in monographs [2], [41]. A number of the presented results are based on studies of the boundary behavior of conformal and quasiconic display (see [9], [28], [35]). In each of the sections of this work, one or more interconnected results are obtained within the framework of this cycle of work. 2. The regularity of the autonomous operator of the superposition (composition) and the circulation operator in this section we rely mainly on the results of the work [18], [19], [21]. Determination 2.1. Let x, y, z - some functional spaces, are such that for each pair of functions f ∈ X, g ∈ Y the function F ° g belonging to the space Z. Then the operator of the composition t [f, g] is determined on the x × y]: X × Y → Z, T: (F, G) 7 → F ° G = T [F, G]. (2.1) definition 2.2. Let X, Y - some functional spaces, such that for each function F ∈ X is determined the function of F - 1 ∈ Y. Then the operator of the circulation J [f]: x → y, j: f 7 → f -1 = j [f] is determined on the X. (2.2) Consider the properties of superposition and circulation in Shauder's spaces. We give the necessary designations and definitions, following, mainly [17]. Let ω - open set in RN. The space m times continuous-differentiated functions F: ω → R, the derivatives of which the Mo-Order satisfies the condition of the Helder order α, equipped with a natural norm, we denote CM, α (ω). The subspace of CM, α (ω) of those functions that allow a uniform continuation on CL ω along with their derivatives to order M inclusive, and the latter satisfy the condition of Helder on CL ω, denote CM, α (CL ω). Symbols CM, α (ω; RK), CM, α (CL ω; RK) indicate the spaces of vector function, the components of which belong to the corresponding spaces. For 186 subspace of functions taking values ​​in a certain set b ⊂ rn, the designations CM, α (ω; b), cm, α (CL ω; b) are used. The symbol of CM, αp (CL ω) indicates the closing according to the norm of the space CM, α (CL ω) the space of polynomial n variables. The above spaces are called Shauder's spaces. We also introduce the concept of a set regularly in the sense of Whitney. Let ω - open set in RN. The set of ω is called regular in the sense of the Whitney, if it is limited both coherently and finite the value of C [ω]: = SUP {λ (s, t) ‖s - t‖, s, t ∈ ω, s 6 = t} < +ger , (2.3) where λ (s, t): = inf {leength (γ), γ ∈ C1 ([0, 1]; ω): γ (0) = s, γ (1) = t}. It is known [12] (p. 12) that if ω is an open, limited, coherent subset RN, which has a class of class C1, then ω regularly in the sense of Whitney. The properties of the regularity of the composition operators (2.1) and the appeal (2.2) are described by the following statements. Theorem 2.1 [19]. Let m ∈ N, α ∈ (0, 1]. Let the sets also ωj, j = 1, 2, - open limited subset rnj, respectively, and ω1 regularly in the sense of Whitney. Then the operator of the composition (2.1) is the operator of the CR class, r ∈ N, from the space CM+R, αp (CL ω2) × cm, α (CL ω1; ω2) into the space CM, α (CL ω1). Theorem 2.2 [19]. Let m ∈ N, α ∈ (0 , 1]. Let the sets also ωj, j = 1, 2, - regular in the sense of the Whitney of the subset RN. We denote IM, α: = {g ∈ CM, α (cl ω1; rn): g (t) 6 = g (t) 6 = g (t) 6 = g (t) s), s 6 = t, g (CL ω1) = CL ω2, DETDG (t) 6 = 0, T ∈ CL ω1
