Trynin1 1 TAYU@rambler.ru; Saratov State University. N.G. Chernyshevsky in the article discusses the justice of the principle of localization of syncproxymies on the segment in the class of functions integrated by Riman. Keywords: syncproximation, cardinal functions, approximation, localization principle. 358 Materials of the International School-Conference, the work is devoted to the study of the approximative properties of the synck-attachments of LN (f, x) = n∑ k = 0 sin (nx −kπ) nx −kπ f (kπ n) = n∑ k = 0 (−1) k sinnx nx −kπ f (kπ n) = n∑ k = 0 lk, n (x) f (kπ n). (1) inside the interval (0, π). Interesting signs of uniform convergence on the axis of the cardinal functions of the Whittecter are given in [1], [2]. Equally important are sufficient conditions for the convergence of sync-approximations were obtained by the authors of articles [3], [4]. Unfortunately, when continuous functions approach the segment using (1) and many other operators near the ends of the segment, the phenomenon of Gibbs arises (see, for example, [5]). In [6], [7], [11] and [5], various assessments of the errors of the approximation of analytical functions in the circle using synck-concerns (1) were obtained. As far as I know, before the advent of these works, the approximation of the cuttrock on a segment or a limited interval was carried out for only some classes of analytical functions to the occasion of the axis using a conformal display. Article [11] establishes accurate in order to evaluate the functions and constants of the operator’s label (1), as well as the operator’s approximative properties of the operator (1), the formula of G.P. Nevay. The work [8], [12] are devoted to obtaining the necessary and sufficient conditions of the preoccupation and uniform inside the interval (0, π) of the convergence of syncproximation (1) for continuous for [0, π] functions. The authors of an interesting article [13] use the results of work [8] to study the convergence of algorithms of multi-level syncproximations of functions with minimal smoothness. In [14], an example of continuous, disappearing at the ends of the segment [0, π] is built, for which the sequence of values ​​of operators (1) unlimitedly diverges everywhere on the interval (0, π). From the results of studies in [14] it is clear that when trying to approach unwatering continuous functions, the values ​​of operators (1) may occur “resonance”, leading to an unlimited increase in approximation error in the entire interval (0, π). We will say that for the interpolation process of syncproximation (1) in the vicinity (x0-δ1, x0+Δ2), the principle of Δ-localization in the class of functions f (x0, Δ1, Δ2) at point x0 ∈ [0, π] , if for any functions f ∈ F (x0, δ1, Δ2), g ∈ F (x0, Δ1, Δ2), which coincide in δ-oxes of point X0: OPA (x0) = (x0-δ1, x0+Δ2) ∩ [0, π], there is a ratio of lim n → ger (f, x0) −ln (g, x0) = 0. (2) definition. We will say that for the interpolation process of syncapproximation (1), the principle of localization in the class of functions f occurs if f ⊂⋂ x0] [0, π]; Δ1> 0, Δ2> 0 F (x0, Δ1, Δ2). In this work, using the concept of publications [15]-[22] it is shown that for the many functions integrated by the riman, the principle of localization for the interpolation process of syncproximation (1). A.Yu. Trynin 359 The following statement is true. Lemma 1. Let F integrate in the sense of the Riemann on the segment [0, π], x0 ∈ [0, π] and Oaf (x0) = (x0 −δ, x0 +δ) ∩ [0, π]. In order for lim n → ° ∑ k: xk, n∈ [0, π] \ oδ (x0) fn (xk, n) f (xk, n) = 0, it is necessary and enough to ensure that the sequence 0 ≤ x1, n <·,, · <xn, n ≤π, satisfied the conditions of lim n → ° ∑ k: xk, n∈ [a, b] (⊂ [0, π] \ oδ (x0) fn (xk) fn (xk , n) = 0, max n] ≤ m <inous, for any sequence of sets il = ⋃ 1≤ j≤ml [a j, b j], ml <mm, [a j, b j] ⊂ [0, π], ⊂ [0, π] \ oδ (x0) ⊃ I1 ⊃ I2 ⊃. . .

For the interpolation process of the synck of approximation (1), the principle of localization on the class integrated according to the riman on the segment [0, π] takes place. Proof. We are convinced that for synck-function lk, n (x) from (1) the ratio of lim n → ∞ k: xk, n∈ [a, b] (⊂ [0, π] \ oδ (x0) LK, LK, NRO, are true. n (x0)) = 0, max n] ≤ m <inous, for any sequence of sets il = ⋃ 1≤ j≤ml [a j, b j], ml <mm, [a j, b j] ⊂ [0, π], ⊂ [0, π] \ oδ (x0) ⊃ I1 ⊃ I2 ⊃. . .
