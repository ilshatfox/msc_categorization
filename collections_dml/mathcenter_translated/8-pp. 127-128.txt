One class of regulatory methods of the first kind equations in the banach space is considered a linear operator equation Ax = F, X ∈ X. Here A ∈ L (X) is a linear completely continuous operator, X is a complex banakh space. Let their approaches AH ∈ L (X) and FPONA and FPONS X are known instead of the exact operator A and the right side of F, such that ‖AH —A‖l (x) ≤ h, ‖fδ - f‖x ≤ δ. We fix the families of endless subspace {nl} and {mm} from X. We denote through the i a single operator, through PL and QM - projectors for subspace NL and MM, respectively. It is assumed that Sup l ‖pl‖l (x) <mm, sup m ‖qm‖l (x) <mm and 127 lim l → ‖ (i - pl) x‖ ° = limm → → ‖ (i qm )x‖X = 0 ∀x ∈ X. В силу полной непрерывности оператора A существуют такие последовательности {ηl}, {ωm}, что lim  l→∞ ηl = lim  m→∞ ωm = 0, ‖A(I − Pl) ‖L (x) ≤ ηl, ‖ (i −qm) a‖l (x) ≤ ωm. The group of methods of approximation of solutions x ∗ is investigated by the initial equation xmlα = (i θ (qmahpl, α) qmahpl) ₽ + θ (qmahpl, α) qmfδ. (1) here α ∈ (0, α0], the element ă ∈ X is the initial approximation to the desired solution x ∗, θ (λ, α) (λ ∈ C, α ∈ (0, α0]) - a family of generating functions. Discharged. Method (1) is subject to the source of the initial unleash x ∗ ∗ ∗ du = apv+ w; v; v, w ∈ X, p> 0, ‖W‖ ≤ ∆. When performing a number of non -alien restrictions on the function θ (λ, α) is fair Theorem. Let the parameter of the regulator α are consistent with errors h, δ so that α ∈ (0, α0], lim h, δ → 0 α = lim h, Δ → 0, l → ° α -1 (h + δ + ηl ) = 0. Then (1) determines the regulatory algorithm for the initial task, and there is an assessment of ‖xmlα - x ∗ ≤ ≤ c (h + δ + ηl α + ‖v‖ (αp + h + ηl + ωm) + ∆) where the constant C> 0 does not depend on α, h, Δ, l, m.
