The generalized Miln -Front theorem for a rectangular wedge is considered the task of indignation of the given complex potential F (Z) by introducing into an infinite isotropic environment of the S2 of foreign inclusion S1 - rectangular Kjshna (s1 = {x ;;; :: o, y ;;;; :: O}) . The case is investigated when a given complex potential has a final number of logarithmic features in the end points of inclusion S1. The task is to find a piece-matomorphic function (see [1]) V (Z) = {VI (Z) = F1 (Z) + V1O (Z), Z E 81; v2 (z) = = v2o (z), z e s2} according to the regional conditions {v1 (x) = av2 (x) - bv2 (x), v1 (iy) = av2 (iy) + bv2 (iy), x > o, y> o, where a, B are material coefficients, VP0 - unknown regular parts in 8P, P = 1.2, and F1 (Z) - the well -known main part V1 (Z). In the functions of V0P (Z), V0p (1/Z), p = 1, 2, the presence of integrated features at the beginning of the coordinates is allowed. Without reducing the community, it is enough to investigate the case of tentyal with a single feature of 8 1, that is, when j '(z) = f1 (z) = ~ z - a shows that the solution of the problem has the form: v1 ( z) = t (z) + f1 (z) + dt (-z) + df1 (-z), z e s1 v2 (z) = t (z)/a + f1 (z)/a, z e s2 , T.V.
