. A numerical method for solving the filtering problem with the maximum gradient in the variation production of O. A. Shirokov NIMM of the Kazakh State University Olga. Shirokova@ksi.ru presented a numerical solution to the problem of filtering with the maximum gradient in variation. The task is considered to be supplanted by water of viscous and plastic oil in a circular layer through the discentric non-centrices of the well; G+, g_ - boundaries of constant pressure (entrance and you are the course of the filtration flow), g+: p = n, g_: p = o, where the given pressure. For the current function F on impermeable faces 360 Tsakh G1, G2 of the region, the conditions are met where Q is filtrated. It is known [1] that the true field of speeds minimizes the function of the function J ('f) = / l G (i' \ l'ljj i) dxdy - HQ, where the function G is determined by the law of filtering. Filtering with the maximum gradient where T is the size of the maximum gradient, k is filtration resistance. The presence of a maximum pressure gradient is driven to the fact that region N is divided into areas of two types: filtration zone and stagnant. The mobile border of these zones is not known in advance and is determined in the course of solving the problem. A direct number of filtration currents based on minimizing non -differentiated functionality allows you to find a true field of speeds and determine the position of a free border. To walk the minimum functionality, relaxation algorithms for minimizing non -differential functions are used, and the proposals in the work [2]. Literature 1. Kosterin A.V.
