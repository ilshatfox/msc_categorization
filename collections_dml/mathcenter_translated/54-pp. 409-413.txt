. Integral Representations of Solutions for a Second Order Hyperbolic Equation with a Supersingular Point F.M. Shamsudinov  In this paper, for a hyperbolic equation of the second order with a supersingular point, we obtain representations of the set of solutions by means of two arbitrary functions of one independent variable, the properties of the solutions obtained are studied, and also the boundary Value Problem a is investigated.

UDC 517.52 On the incorrectness of a sign of the integrity of Dini Fourier, the generalized Haar systems in zero groups V.I. Shcherbakov1 1 kafmathan@mail.ru; Moscow Technical University of Communications and Informatics The article says that the deductible signing [0, 1] is a preoccupational sign of convergence of the Fourier rows for generalized Haar S-signs Dini, which (for SUP N PN = ∞) is always better than the sign-scales (sigicadini-Vilenkin) It becomes incorrect to the zero compact abelevs of the group, because the convergence on the group may depend on the choice of basic elements. Keywords: Nolmer compact Ableva Group, modified segment [0, 1], generalized Haara systems, V -signs of Dini (sign of Dinivilenkin), S -signs of Dini. 410 Materials of the International School-Conference, let P0 = 1, {Pn} inous = 1-a sequence consisting of simple numbers; mn = n∏ k = 0 pk (n = 0.1.2,...). Any natural number N in the only way can be decomposed according to the formula n = s∑ k = 0 ak mk = asms +n ′, (1) where AK, S and N ′ are whole with 0 ≤ AK <pk +1; 1 ≤ as <ps+1; 0 ≤ n ′ <ms. Let G - zero compact Ableva Group (Vilenkin group) with an operation ⊕ and the reverse operation ⊖ and with the embedded system of subgroups G = G0 ⊃G1 ⊃G2 ⊃. . . ⊃GN ⊃. . . and φ⋂ n = 0 gn = {0g} (2) (0g-the zero element G) and the factor-group GN-1 \ GN has order PN (n = 1.2,...). The system of subgroups {gn} ger in this way is a system of zero system. Regarding the above topology, we determine the limit and continuity of the function (under the function we will decide to display the group G in many complex numbers C). It turned out a zero compact Ableva group, which is sometimes called a group of Vilenkin (it was determined by N.Ya. Vilenkin [1]). In each of the adjacent classes GN -1 \ GN, we choose according to the element EN (n = 1.2,..), Which we will call basic and fix. Then any point x ∈G in the only way can be decomposed according to the formula x = x1e1 ⊕x2e2 ⊕. . .⊕xnen ⊕. . . , (3) where xk is whole with 0 ≤ xk <pk; for a ∈G, by definition, ka = a ⊕a ⊕. . .⊕a︸ ︷︷ ︸ k times and 0a = 0g. Number XK in equality (3) will be called by the coefficient of the element x ∈G when it is decomposed according to the basis {en} mmn = 1. You can determine the display of group G on the segment [0, 1]: x = x1e1 ⊕x2e2 ⊕. . .⊕xnen ⊕. . . 7 -→ φ∑ n = 1 xn mn (4) with a violation of mutual unambiguousness only at {pn} -rational points (points x1e1⊕x2e2⊕. ⊕ (xn −1) en ⊕ (pn+1–1) En +1⊕ (pn+2–1) en+2⊕. ⊕ (pn+k −1) en+k ⊕.

By putting µ (x ⊕ gn) = 1mn, according to the Lebel scheme, we determine the measure (on the Borelev sets it coincides with the measure of Haar) and the absolutely converging integral on G. For L (G) we denote many functions, the integral from which the Group G is absolutely converged. Similarly, the actual straight line is determined by the orthogonal and orthonormated systems of functions. Consider the following orthonomated system of functions {χn (x)} و = 0: χ0 (x) ≡ 1; χmk (x) = {p mk Exp (2iπxk+1 pk+1), if x ∈Gk 0 for x ∈G \ Gk (k = 0.1.2,..) And V.I. Shcherbakov 411 χn (x) = χas ms+n ′ (x) = (χms (x⊖ <n ′ ms>)) as where XK is defined in the formula (3), s, as and n ′ - in equal terms (1 ), and <n′MS> - the “final” prototype of the number N ′ MS when displaying the monn (4) (that is, all the coefficients of the element <n′MS> when it declines according to the formula (3), starting with (S +1) -How, equal to zero). For pn ≡ 2, the system {χn (x) ¾ φ = o coincides with the Haar system [4]; For SUP N Pn <و, it was considered (on the segment [0, 1]) B.I. Golubov and A.I. Rubinstein [5]; For any PN (also on the segment [0, 1]) - B.I. Golubov [6] (B.I. Golubov and A.I. Rubinstein [5], as well as B.I. Golubov [6] The condition of simplicity on the number PN was not imposed); In zero compact aboles groups, it was considered by S.F. Lukomsky [7]. The following major nuclei are known for the nuclear nuclear on the generalized Haar systems {χn (x)} φ n = 0: 1. Majorant Vilenkin (V -Majorant): V (X) = Mn+1, if x ∈Gn \ GN+1; N = 0.1.2 ,. . . (in [1] v (x) is designated as [1x]); 2. S-majorant S (x) = mn sin πxn+1pn+1 for x ∈Gn \ gn+1; n = 0.1,2 ,. . . , a xn+1 are defined in (3) (in [8] S (x) designated as Q (x)). Depending on the major nuclear nuclei, there are two signs of Dini's convergence for the rows of Fourier on generalized Haar systems on zero compact
