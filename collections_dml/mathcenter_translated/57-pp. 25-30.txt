Mendeleev in 1887 (solved by A.A. Markov in 1889). In the next 100 years, the Mendeleev problem was repeatedly modificated and solved. Its essence is in the description of conditions under which the inequality | f (z)| ≤ |F (z)| for polynomials f and F and for z from a fixed set    26 МАТЕРИАЛЫ ШКОЛЫ-КОНФЕРЕНЦИИ  implies the inequality |L[ f ](z)| ≤ |L[F ](z)| for some differential operator L. In the presented paper, we consider a differential operator of special type and arbitrary order.  Keywords: polynomial, inequality, differential operator.  By Pn we denote the set of all polinomials in C of degree at most n ∈N. In 1887 D.I. Mendeleev [8, § 86] posed the following problem: for a polynomial f ,  deg f = 2, with | f (x)| ≤ M for x ∈ [a,b], give an estimation of | f ′(x)| for x ∈ [a,b]. In the book of V.I. Smirnov and N.A. Lebedev [11, p. 340] this problem was formulated in more general form. It was called the Mendeleev problem: let B ⊂C be a compact set, f (z) be a polynomial, deg f = n ≥ 1, | f (z)| ≤ M for z ∈ B. Give the best estimation of | f ′(z)| for z ∈ B.  The Mendeleev problem was solved by A.A. Markov in 1889 in the case of real polynomials and compact set B = [a;b].  Theorem A. [6, p. 51–75]. Let f ∈Pn and | f (x)| ≤ M for x ∈ [a,b]. Then  | f ′(x)| ≤ 2n 2M  b −a .  Here the equality is attained only by the functions  f (x) =±MTn (  2x −a −b b −a  ) where Tn = cos(n arccos x) is the Chebyshev polynomial.  V.A. Markov obtained analogous result for k-th derivative of a real polynomial f , 1 ≤ k ≤ n, [7, p. 81–93].  ByD denote the unit disc {z ∈C : |z| < 1}. V.I. Smirnov proved the Mendeleev problem for complex polynomials in the case B = ∂D.  Theorem B. [10], [11, ch.V, § 1, 20, p. 346] (see also [1, pp. 38–44]). Let f ∈Pn and | f (z)| ≤ M on ∂D. Then on ∂D  | f ′(z)| ≤ Mn. The equality holds only if f (z) = eiγzn , γ ∈R. Theorem B can be reformulated as follows:  Theorem B′. Let f ∈Pn and | f (z)| ≤ |M zn | on ∂D. Then | f ′(z)| ≤ |(M zn)′| on ∂D.  The equality holds only if f (z) = eiγzn , γ ∈R. S.N. Bernstein generalized Theorem B′. He changed the polynomial M zn to an arbi trary polynomial F, degF = n. More precisely, he obtained the following result: Theorem C. [2]. Let f and F be polynomials such that  (∗)    1) deg f ≤ degF = n, 2) F has all its zeros in D, 3) | f (z)| ≤ |F (z)| on ∂D.  Then | f ′(z)| ≤ |F ′(z)| for z ∈C\D.    K.F. Amozova, E.G. Ganenkova, V.V. Starkov 27  For z ∈C\D equality holds only in f = eiγF, γ ∈R. V.I. Smirnov generalized Theorem D. For z ∈C\D byΩ|z| denote the image of the disc  {t ∈ C : |t | < |z|} under the mapping ψ(t ) = t 1+ t . For f ∈ Pn put Sα[ f ](z) = z f  ′(z) − nα f (z), α is a complex constant.  Theorem D. [11, ch.V, § 1, p. 356]. Let f and F be polynomials possessing conditions (∗). Then for z ∈C\D  |Sα[ f ](z)| ≤ |Sα[F ](z)| for all α ∈Ω|z|. For α ∈Ω|z| equality holds at a point z ∈C\D only if f = eiγF, γ ∈R.  If we put α= 0 in Theorem D we obtain the Bernstein Theorem C. In [5, p. 65] M. Marden presented a differential operator B : Pn → Pn . The Marden  operator carries a polynomial f ∈Pn into the polynomial  B [ f ](z) =λ0 f (z)+λ1 nz  2 f ′(z)+λ2  (nz 2  )2 f ′′(z) 2!  ,  where λ0, λ1 and λ2 are constants such that all roots of the polynomial  u(z) =λ0 +nλ1z + n(n −1)  2 λ2z  2 (1)  belong to the half-plane Re z ≤ n 4  . Q.I. Rahman and G. Schmeisser obtained the following generalization of Theorem D for the operator B.  Theorem E. [9, p. 538–540]. Let f and F be polynomials possessing conditions (∗). Then  |B [ f ](z)| ≤ |B [F ](z)|, z ∈C\D, (2) For z ∈C\D in (2) equality holds only in the case f = eiγF, γ ∈R.  This theorem was generalized in different ways (see, for example [12] and references herewith).  Let T : Pn → Pn be a linear operator. The operator T preserves zeros if, for every polynomial F of degree n having all its zeros in D, the polynomial T [F ] also has all zeros in D.  In [9, p. 538] Rahman and Schmeisser proved that Theorem F takes place not only for the operator B , but for any operator T preserving zeros. In [4] we showed that the converse statement is also true:  Theorem F. Let T : Pn →Pn be a linear operator. Then T preserves zeros if and only if for all f and F possessing conditions (∗)  |T [ f ](z)| ≤ |T [F ](z)|, z ∈C\D, (3) and for z ∈C\D in (2) equality holds only if f = eiγF, γ ∈R.  In the paper [4] we introduced the modified Smirnov operator, which carries a polynomial f ∈Pn into  S̃a[ f ](z) = (1+az) f ′(z)−na f (z),    28 МАТЕРИАЛЫ ШКОЛЫ-КОНФЕРЕНЦИИ  a ∈ D. The modified Smirnov operator S̃a is more preferred in a sense than the Smirnov operator Sα, because the param
