) The transformation of the airship and some of its applications in the work [1] introduced and studied the generalized discrete prefix Fourier, which each sequence A (L) = {(A1, L1), (A2, L2), ..., (AP, LP, LP ), ".}, where LN is material, AST: Text numbers, {an} e 11, puts it in line with a series of fu (t) = l a (l) esh, (1)>. A (t )-almost-periodic (p.-p.) in the sense of boron function. In the darkened works of the author, various applications of this transformation to solving integral equations in the average meanings and to solving some problems of the MATA are indicated;-; 1ATICH PHYSIAN.

The transformation of the airship will allow you to reduce some of the Blessed Systems with different indices and the tasks of mathematical physics to solving the problem of Riemann for the strip or floor of the village, fragrances in K.1ASAS of analytical paragraphs-p.
