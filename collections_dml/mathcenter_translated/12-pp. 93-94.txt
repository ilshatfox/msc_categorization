Kayumov Ural State University, Yekaterinburg E-Mail: Rashid. kayumov@isi.ru let lp = {a = I <x1 <... <hp = b} - breakdown of the segment [a, b], d (lp) - its diameter, si, (lp) - space [, - - - - - CRMains on the breakdown of the HP, the rapids by the differential operator f, ~ d1+µ1, s · 1.

Theorem 2. Let [a, b] = [o, it "µ) and the length of one of the segments of the detachment is close to 7ciµ. We denote the sum of the lengths of the remaining segments of the breakdown through L for the values ​​of the element of the best approximation si · (dp) (x ; .f) in the nodes of the LP grid, the rating is 93 max {1 s · l (lp) (xk,: f) ': k = o ".., n} ~ (38/l -: - o (l)) 'i fllc. Theorem Z. Let [a, b) = [o, liµj. Then there is a constant with such that m (µ, l) S. Studies are performed with financial support for the RFFI (about SKT 99-01-00140). The bend of the plate on the layer is UPR} To-plastic material V.E. Koisin SP6GMTU. . :. San/\ M-Peterb;, p. ' E-mail: koissin@mail.ru in the work solved the problem of the shy tense state of the plate, 1-degree on the layer of elastic-rshastic material, under the influence of concentrated force, which is fashion, 1I-layer of a three layer plate lying on a rigid base. The main theory of the TII aspect of the problem is the use of integrated pre -formations and asymptotic decays from the theory of elasticity of not homogeneous bodies, and practical significance is determined by the wide Profit, N, by calling three -layer panels (fiberglass + light foam plast). In the mathematical setting of the task of an endless plate, which is operated on a layer of ultimate thickness, the equations of the bend of the plate (EN-vsnan and the flat theory of elasticity (plasticity). Mulas for the main variable desired variables. For analysis in about; ~ asti of the plastic deformation of the filler, the model of the elastic-frauded and elastic-produced beam, the wives with concentrated force and a distributed load equal to 94
