The weak convergence of the fouring rows if f (x) 27r-periodic and integrates on [o, 27R] in the sense of Henstok (or, otherwise, R*-integrive), then its Fourier 27 '27' AN =.; (R*) / f (x) cos nxdx, bp =.; (R*) / f (x) sin nxdx, o oh and therefore, there is a number of Fourier functions F (x), which we will call nearby fury-henstock. Since the trial (R*) is integrated functions, for CO2 "the same integral of the Lebaga (L) J LF (X) IPDX does not exist for any P> o, you can not talk about the convergence of the rows of Fourierichenstok in the LP metric (p> about ). However, we can talk about a weak convergence. Through L1, µ, we denote the space of Marcinkevich MF ~ {F ~~ f!
