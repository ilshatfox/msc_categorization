Filippov1 1 8888vadim@mail.ru; Saratov Socio-Economic Institute (branch) of REU named after G.V. Plekhanova obtained the results of the decomposition of elements of multidimensional spaces LP {(0.1] m}, 1 ≤ p <φ, according to the systems of functions consisting of compression and shifts of the same function, with entire coefficients. These studies can also cause interest in specialists in specialists transmission and processing of digital information, since a simple algorithm for approaching the elements of spaces lp {(0.1] m}, 1 ≤ p <mm, with these properties is proposed. Key words: functional systems from compression and shifts of one function in multidimensional spaces LP { (0.1] m}, 1 ≤ p <φ, multidimensional rows of the Fourier type, multidimensional rows of the Fourier type with whole coefficients, digital information processing, digital information transmission, integer decays of functions. The results are continued by studies published in [1] and In other works of the author. Functions systems obtained from compression and shifts of the same function attracted the attention of mathematicians in connection with research research and frames. In the proposed studies Orthonormated systems from compression systems and shifts of the same function are not built. We get the decomposition of LP spaces directly according to this system, consisting of compression and shifts of one function. A significant error in calculating the initial coefficients is allowed. At the same time, the proposed algorithm adjusts the errors of the calculation of the coefficients. 344 Materials of the School-Conference recently among mathematicians have a certain interest in decompositions into ranks with entire coefficients. So, in [3] the result is the result of the existence of a sequence of trigonometric polynomials with whole positive coefficients, which converges to zero almost everywhere. In article [4], systems from compression and shifts of the same function are also considered, but the decomposition coefficients are almost as a Fourier coefficients and somewhat differently than in the proposed work. Let ψ (x) = {1, if x ∈ (0.1]; 0, if x ∉ (0.1], (1) ψ (t) = ψ (t1, t2, ..., tm) = ψ (t1) · ψ (t2) · · · ψ (tm), ti ∈ (0.1], i = 1, m. Consider the functional systems of the species {ψn, j} = {ψn, j1, j2, .. ., jm} = {1 2n -1 ψ (2n - 11 - j1 −1) · ψ (2N - 11t2 - j2 −1) · · · ψ (2N - 11tm - jm −1)} = {ψl}, n = 1.2, ..., ji = 1.2n - 1, ti ∈ (0.1], i = 1, m, l = 1.2, .... (2) a continuous specific numbering of elements is proposed this system. You can propose other numbering of the elements inside the pack. This will not affect the proof of the theorem. Let the arbitrary function F ∈ LP {(0.1] m}, 1 ≤ p <mm. Consider a series φ∑ l = 1 d ∗ l Ψl = φ∑ i = 1 (2i-1∑ j1 = 1 2i-1∑ j2 = 1 ... 2i-1∑ jm = 1 d ∗ i, J1, J2, ..., JMψi, J1, J2, J2, ..., jm), (3) where fk+1 = fk - 2k - 1 j1 = 1 2k --1∑ j2 = 1 .. 2k - 1 jm = 1 d ∗ k, j1, j2, .. ., jmψk, j1, j2, ..., jm, f1 = f, k ≥ 1, coefficients d ∗ l = d ∗ k, j1, j2, ..., jm = d ∗ k, j are whole and calculated by special way. Theorem. Let the arbitrary function F ∈ LP {(0.1] m}, 1 ≤ p <mm. Then p is set The poison (3) according to the system (2) with the generating functionψ as in (1) converges according to the norm of the space LP {(0.1] m}, 1 ≤ p <mm to f (t), i.e. ∥∥ f ∑n l = 0 d ∗ l ψ p ∥∥ p → 0, n → urb. Comment. Let us call the decomposition of fuccation in theorem 1 integer decomposition of functions from the corresponding spaces. Example. Our task, for example, is the broadcast or preservation of a television audio and a video signal using its decomposition to integers. Note that in this case, the compression of the images is also obtained. Using the designations of the work [2], in the case of onic (t) = | t | 2, we get ∗2 (l) = ∗ ∗ 2 (l) = e 2 accord (note that index 2 at the top and bottom means that the two -dimensional space is considered), where eρ1 = e accord is l2 {(0.1] 2}, and eρ2 = e accord is L2 (0.1]. The space L2 {(0.1] 2} is used to approach the images according to the system (3) in a fixed The moment of V.I. Filippov 345 Time TL. The space L2 (0.1] is used to approach the sound signal in it by the system (3) over the moment of time (TL, TL+1). Such moments during conventional broadcasting, for example, It can be 24 in one second. If at the same time there are many stationary zones in the image, then from the moment it is possible to transmit only information about the changed zones from moment to moment. Consider the system of functions {ψn, J1, J2; ψn, J1} = {ψL}, where L First, the elements are numbered in the nth pack of the system {ψn, j1, j2} = {ψ1l}, and then in the nth pack of the system {ψn, j1} = {ψ2l}. We call the system {ψl} the decomposition system (integer decomposition system ) in spaces E e 2 accord if there is a row ∑ et l = 1 clψl (∑ happen of 1 c ∗ l ψl, c ∗
