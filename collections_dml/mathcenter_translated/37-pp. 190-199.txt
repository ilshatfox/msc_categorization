Determination of heterogeneity in flat waves by neural networks Fig. A waveguide with a metal screen has a flat waveguide, which is a dielectric with metal walls X = 0 and X = H (see Fig.). The environment is supposed to be homogeneous and isotropic. In the waveguide there is heterogeneity in the form of a flat perfect screen, set by three numbers (α, β, d). The task of finding such heterogeneity is set in some part of the waveguide 0 <d <d <d <d, for the solution of which the neural network is used. Signals are generated → A = (→ A 1, → A 2,.), Emitting a certain source. The corresponding reflected signal 191 ← A = (← A 1, ← A 2,.) Is recorded by a sensor. The function F (→ A, ← A) = (α, β, D) is required, in order to determine the position of the heterogeneity set by the numbers (α, β, d) by a pair of signals. Suppose that numbers (α, β, d) and signal → A are known. Put the recalling so -called. The direct task of finding the reflected signal ← a. In the general case, this task reduces the infinite system of linear algebraic equations (BSLAU) −h 2 ← a ke −iγkd+ ∑ n> 0 ← ane −γnd (1- γn γk) ink = ∑ n> 0 → ane Imbes, k> 0, where is ink = ∫ β α ∈ (x) onic (x) dx (Ink are calculated in the closed form), γn = √ k2 - (πn h) 2 (= γn 6 0, <γn> 0), and k - The number characterizes the signal distribution environment. In [2] it is proven that this blanch can be solved by truncation. In practice, it will be possible to measure only the final number of signal coordinates → A and ← A, and Blanca will become an ordinary sludge, which can be solved by any suitable numerical method. Let now we have some final set of given {→ a (k), ← a (k), α (k), β (k), d (k)} korn, | k | = N after solving N direct problems. The initial task is reduced to the construction of such a FW function that the minimum of the following functionality is achieved: φ (w) = ∑ k organ ∥∥∥∥ (α (k), β (k), d (k)) - fw (→ a (→ a (→ a (→ a (→ a (→ k), ← a (k) ∥∥∥∥ 2 - → min, where ‖ (x, y, z) ‖2 = x2 + y2 + z2. The FW function is searched in a certain form set by the so -called. architecture of the neural network. This work uses a multi -layer perceptron. 192 Thus, the task is to select the coefficients W = (W1,., WM), on which the desired minimum is achieved. The selection is implemented using the so -called.

Lobachevsky, tty@list.ru Category Pseudo ∆-psyche with a non-aable structural group Consider the smooth main stratification lection with the projection p: e → B and the structural group G. On the basis of the stratification, we set the right action R: b × ∆ → B. The final group ∆. Determination 1. Let U - an open coating of diversity B, for which there is an atlas A (u) of stratification ă and rδ (u) = U for all U ∈ U, Δ ∈ ∆. Then the U is called (cil, ∆)-cover. 193 Determination 2. Let U-(cil, ∆) -Prolling the base b and u ∈ U, and eu = p-1 (u). Action Ru: EU × ∆ → E We call the local raising of the action R to the space of the stratification lection if p ®Rruδ = rδ °P for all Δ ∈ ∆ and R U δ (V · G) = R U Δ (V) G for all v for all v ∈ EU, G ∈ G. At the same time, the set r = {ru | u ∈ U} We will call the pseudo-treading of R. Determination 3. Let them (ă, ∆) -pcing u, atlas a (u) stratification iron and pseudo-pseudo = {Ru | u ∈ U} A action R. If the E exists G-ligature, invariant relative to R, then pair (a (u), r) will be called pseudo ∆-atlas. The two pseudo ∆-atlas will be considered equivalent, if many G-bonds, invariant relative to the corresponding pseudo-release, coincide. If a is the equivalence class of the pseudo ∆-atlas (a (u), r), then the pair ρ = (ă, a) will be called pseudo ∆-psyche. By virtue of this definition, if the G-ligature of the invariant relative to some pseudo ∆-atlas pseudo ∆-spray ρ, then it is an invariant regarding all its pseudo ∆-Athlas. Thus, with each pseudo ∆-spray ρ is associated with many invariant g-binding hρ. Let F: E → E ′ - Morphism over b of the main strata ă = (e, p, b, g) and ă ′ = (e ′, p ′, b, g). Then F is isomorphism and induces the bijection F ∗ of the many G-bonds of the stratification lection into many G-bonds of the stratification ′. Let us now consider the pseudo ∆-psyche ρ = (ă, a) and ρ ′ = (ă ′, a ′). Determination 4. If f ∗ (hρ) = hρ ′, then we will call fraphism the pseudo ∆-psyche ρ and ρ ′. We will consider the variety of b, group G, ∆ and action R: b × ∆ → B. Then the many pseudo ∆ 194 strata over B with the structural group G and their morphisms form the category K (B, G, ∆, R).
