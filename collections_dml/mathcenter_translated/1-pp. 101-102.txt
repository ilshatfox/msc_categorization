. Finding a limited own functions of one singular operator Degryarenko N.A., Zvelynch E.I. Belarusian State Technological University, Minsk Let K and K ' - positive numbers. We denote through SN about El the liptic function of Jacobi [l] with the main periods of 4k and 2ik '. We look at the homogeneous singular integral equation A, ja <p (t) dt <p (t)---; = O, -a <t <a,; r 1 _ 0 sn (t -t) (1) where a e (o, k). Since the SN function is about the material axis and odd, the identity of 101 Degtyarenko N.A. is performed, Zvezherovich E.I. and the finding of the festivities of the11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111}} ;; ; I SN (:-t) Â· (2) Therefore, the integral operator B (1) is self-consolidated (as an operator from LI (-a, a) in Li (-a, a)). Therefore (see [2]), all its characteristic numbers A. are material, and its own functions, which correspond to various characteristic numbers, are orthonal. In this paper, the entire system of characteristic seques and their own functions of the integral operator in equation (1) in the space L2 (-a, a) was found in a clear form. With regard to the equation (1) the belonging of the own functions of the space LI (-a, a) means their limitation, so below will be discussed only about the limited own functions. To solve the problem, the method of analytical continuation (3) is applicable, i.e., we introduce into the consideration of the bicopperiodic KU COO-Analytic function 1 Ja TP (R) DR F (Z): =-. , n [-a, a], 2tr 1 _ 0 sn (r-z) (3) where all the characters on the right side indicate the same as in the equi equi (1). Since the differential has at points r = z z. , r = z+2k SN (r-Z) simple poles with deductions in them equal to 1 and -1, respectively, for the integral (3) on the lines of its gap (-a, a) and (-a+2k, a+2k ) The formulas of the Sohotz. The formula [3]: j f+(t) -f- (t) = tp (t), f+(l)+f- (1) = ~ j tp (r) DR_ (4) are fair TR 1 -a Sn (R - T) using these formulas, as well as the identity of SN (Z + 2K) !! -sn (z), we rewrite equation (1) in the form of the next task of the linear conjugation: 102 j f+(l) =: ~~ f- (1), te (-a, a), f (IU-K)+ F (IU+K) = O, -K '<k <k', f (x -ik ') = f (x+ik'), -k <x <to.
