It is quite a geodesical placement, determined by the infinite zealousness of the tangent stratification of the generalized Lagranzhev space O. V. Sukhov Penza State Pedagogical University, Rimanova, the structure of almost a work set by infinitezimal coherence on the stratification of the generalized Lagranzhev space. INVIARITIONALE characteristics have been obtained in the case when the horizontal distribution determines a completely geodetic formation. Let M-smooth n-diversity, tm-tangent stratification, n-infinitezimal connectivity that determines the horizontal distribution Z 7 → Hz and, therefore, the structure of almost the work on tm: tz (tm) = hz⊕vz, where VZ is a vertical distribution . Let h and v - design operators on h and v, respectively: h2 = h, v2 = v, hv = vh = 0. Then p = v - h is the operator of the structure of almost the work: p 2 = id, p (hx) = - - HX, P (VX) = VX. The rimanic metric of the structure is almost a work of the NAZ 148 metric G = <·, ·>, satisfying the condition <x, y> = <hx, hy> + <vx, vy> for any vector fields x, y, from where it follows that <px , Py> = <x, y>. Let the basic diversity M is a generalized lagran space with a metric tensor G. Consider the metric on TM Rimanov, determined by the conditions G (xh, y h) = g (xv, y v) = g (x, y), g (xh, y v) = g (xv, y h) = 0, where XH, Y H, XV, Y V - horizontal and vertical elevators of vector fields from the base to tangent stratification in connectedness n. Obviously, so a certain metric G is a metric of the structure of almost a work. In order for the horizontal distribution to determine a completely geodetic layer, it is necessary and enough to make the condition ∇hxp = 0 to the arbitrary horizontal vector field HX (see [1]), where ∇ is the coherence of Levy - the chivites of the last analysis of the latter Conditions in the structure adapted to the structure of almost work leads us to conclusion, the proposal. Ininsimal connectivity sets a completely geodetic formation, if only if the horizontal distribution of this connectedness is integrated, and the basic diversity is Rimanov. Note that if the basic variety M is Rimanov, infinite zero is generated by Levy's coherence - the chivitis of the metric G, then the space (M, G) is flat. L and t e r a t r a 149
