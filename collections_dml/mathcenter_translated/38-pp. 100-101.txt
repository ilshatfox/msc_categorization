The numerical algorithm for constructing some jet currents of hydrodynamics is devoted to the consideration of simple jet flowing of non -aligned fluid. We give a brief physical description and mathematical in terms of tasks for the surviving polygonal obstacles with a separation of jets. We will consider the flat potential course of the inconspicuous fluid in the single -link of the region D with the border DD: = p u l, consisting of a given polygon P (final or endless) and jets of L, breaking away from its ends Z1, Zn. Polygon R is assumed by simple [1]. The course of the course D and its image D* in the plane of the complex potential are conformally displayed on the upper half -fruit IM (> about so that the vertices of Z1 and Zn are relevant to the points t = ± 1 of the material axis. Then the derivatives of the upper half -frozen DC. The plane W = ER + + IF and the area of ​​the DZ current have the form [1], p. 152: ~~ = ko (; ~~ = kp (() m ((). K!

Gubkina 101 The parameters K and TK (k = 2, p -1) are sought from the condition of the coincidence of the landfill, determined by equation z = z (t) at t e [-1, 1], with a given TK+ training ground+ 1 l = g (u), 9k = k j ip (t) llm (t) ldt, k = 1, p - 1, (1) tk where l = (l1, ..., l11 _ 1) - specified Vector of the lengths of the sides of the landfill on p, and = (i1, ..., un -i) - the desired vector. The local unity of the solution of the equation was proved (1). An iterative numerical algorithm of the solution was built For summer cottages and its convergence has been proved. The work was carried out with financial support from the RFFI (about the ECT 09-01 ~ 98001-R-Siberia-A) and the Grant "Mobility of Young Scientists" (project 09-08-90706-Mob-ST). Literature 1.
