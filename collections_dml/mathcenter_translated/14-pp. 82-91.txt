) The use of the Winner-Hopf method to the task of the two-layer course of the severe fluid in the channel considers the task of the interaction of two flows of severe incompatible fluid in the channel with solid motionless walls. On the border of the stream section in the transverse gravity field is a semi -infinite weakly reduced plate set by the equation y = f (x), x <0. Relations γ = ρ1/ρ2 and β = v2/v1 of the densities and velocities of the arising flows are set. The flow scheme is shown in Fig. 1. ρ1 v1n1 n2 ρ2 v2 y g Fig. 1: The flow diagram in the corresponding areas are described by the complex potentials WJ (Z) = vjz + wj (z), Wj (x, y) = ∗j (x, y) + iψj (x, y), j = 1, 2, z = x + iy. In a linear approximation, the task is reduced to finding the functions ψj (x, y) according to the regional conditions ψj (x, yj) = 0, –ura <x <mm, y1 = h1, y2 = —h2, (1) ∂j ∂x ( x, 0) = −vj df (x) dx, x <0. (2) on the boundary of contact, the pressure in the upper and lower liquids is the same, that is, the dynamic condition β ∂2 ∂y (x, 0) - γ ∂11 is performed ∂y (x, 0) = νψ1 (x, 0), x> 0. (3) 88 When crossing the contact border, the continuity of normal components of flows, that is, the kinematic condition of ∂∂2 ∂x (x, 0) is observed = β ∂∂1 ∂x (x, 0), x> 0. (4) here, then all linear dimensions are attributed to the width H1, ν = (1–γ) /FR, FR = V 21 /(GH1), GH1, GH - Acceleration of gravity. When output (3), the equation η = −1 (x, 0) /v1 was used, where y = η (x), x> 0, - the equation of the border of the stream section. To solve the problem, the presentation of harmonic functions ψj (x, y) in the form of an integral of Laplace [1] ψj (x, y) = 1 2πi ∫ iughter —iy main [aj (₽) e iacy + bj (ă) e - is used i etc., (5) where aj (cil), bj (ă) are the desired functions. Of the conditions (1) we get bj (ă) = –Aj (perf) EXP (2Iising). By introducing further the designations xj (perf) = perf (1- e2i charge), yj (hole) = i ed (1 + e2i purpose), a ∗ 1 (ă) = x1 (ă) a1 (₽), from conditions (2) and (2) and (2) and (2) and (2) and (2) and (2) and (2) and (2) and (2) and (2) and (2) and (2) and (2) and (2) and (2) and (2) and (2) and (2) and (2) and (2) and (2) 4) we will have A ∗ 2 (lection) = βa ∗ 1 (lection). From (2) and (3) we obtain for function a ∗ 1 (₽) the pair integral equation 1 2πi ∫ iughter —Iy (1 f (ă) a ∗ 1 (₽) e ξXDurb = (—V1df/dx, x <0 0, x> 0). (6) in which f (hole) = y1 (hole) x1 (perf) - β 2 γ y2 (₽) x2 (₽). In the case of the same width of the channels h1 = h2 = h = π, which further to simplify the presentation and we will consider, f (ă) = r (ă) f1 (ă) f2 (ă), r (ă) = ₽ - 2f0 (₽) ), Fj (₽) = ₽ −1 sin (h ed), f0 (perf) = γ 2 [(β2/γ + 1) ă sin (2h) + (ν/γ) (cos (2h pip)]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]] . To solve the equation (6), the method of Wiener-Hopf is applicable [2]. Let us first consider the pair integral equation of a more general species 1 drop+ic∫ −mm+ic (1 k (α)) a (α) e --iαxdα = (x), x> 0 g (x), x < 0). (7) 89 We will assume that K (α) is a regular function from α = σ+ iτ in the strip τ - <τ <τ+, a (α) - also regular function in this area. If a (α) is known, then 1√ 2π mm+ic∫ −mm+ic k (α) a (α) e --iαxdα = (x), x> 0 l (x), x <0), 1√ 2π mm+ic∫ −mm+ic a (α) e --iαxdα = (h (x), x> 0 g (x), x <0). We apply to these expressions the conversion of Fourier. To do this, multiply them by EXP (Iαx) and we will intervene by x from − char to +urb. After the transformations, we obtain k (α) a (α) = s + (α) + e - (α), a (α) = h + (α) + g - (α). (8) here are the designations 1√ 2π و imes 0 eiαx (s (x) h (x)) dx = (s+(α) h+(α)), 1√ 2π 0∫ −mm eiαx (l (x) g (x)) dx = (e - (α) g - (α)). In these ideas, and everywhere further, the+( -) indicates the analyticism of the functions in the upper half -fluidity τ> τ - (in the lower half -plate τ <τ+), and the functions s+(α), h+(α) will be regular at τ> τ- if in the vicinity φ (| s (x) |, | h (x) |) <m exp (τ - x). Accordingly, for the regularity of the functions g - (α), e - (α) with τ <τ+, it is necessary that (| g (x) |, | l (x) |) <n exp (τ+ x) in the vicinity of −imes Where M, N are some constant. The functions s (x), g (x), l (x), h (x) may have the final number of ruptures and the final number of maximums and minimums on each final part of the integration interval. The functions S+(α), h+(α), e - (α), g - (α), being unilateral transformations of Laplace, are turned to zero at α → ∞. The order of zero is determined by the nature of the behavior of the corresponding function functions in the vicinity of x = 0. Excluding the function A (α) from the system of equations (8) and by factorizing the function K (α), that is, presenting it in the form of K (α) = k-(α) )/K+(α), we obtain the equation h+(α) k+(α) - e - (α) k - (α) = S+(α) k - (α) - G - (α) K+(α). (9) We denote the right side of the equation (9) through C (α). Assuming that C (α) is an analytical function in the strip τ - <τ <τ+ and such that with | σ | → φ 90 | C (σ + iτ) | <const | σ | —m, m> 0, present it in the form of the sum of the two functions C (α) = C+(α)+C - (α), C+(α) = 1 2πi ∞+IC∫ −mm+IC C (t) t - αdt, c - (α) = - 1 2πi φ+id∫ –ura+id c (t) t - αdt, with τ - <τ <d <τ+. Substitute C (α) in the equation (9) and regroup the terms. We get h+ (α) k+ (α) - c+ (α) = e - (α) k - (α)+ c - (α). (10) In this equation, the left side is defined and regular in the area τ> τ–, and the right side in the area τ <τ+, that is, the left and right parts are different ideas of the whole function P (α) in various areas.
