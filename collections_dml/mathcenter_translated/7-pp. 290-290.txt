The influence of approximation of the properties of the thermal plasma flow on the characteristics of Plazotoron I.V. Vinogradov, F.A. Salyanov Institute of Mechanics and Engineering of CAENC of the Russian Academy of Sciences 420111, Kazan, ul. Lobachevsky, 2131 Work is the development of research [1] and others, where smooth approximations of the dependencies of plasma properties on the function of heat potential S were used. However, the study of the study of other situations is of the interest. In Fig. 1 The distribution of the volumetric density of the suggestions from the function S. As you can see, we have a large range of the possibilities of approximation of function N from S, depending on the concrete situation. From Fig. 1 you can see the complexity of the selection of a single continuous function of dependencies of plasma properties on the function of thermal potential. The work analyzes the influence of dependencies of the type of approximation on the dynamic properties of the thermal plasma flow in plasmoron.
