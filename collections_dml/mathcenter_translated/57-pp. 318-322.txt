UDC 517.538.52+517.538.53 On the presentation of the polynomials of the Hermit - Pad in explicitly A.P. Starovoitov1, N.V. Ryabchenko2 1 svoitov@gsu.by; Gomel State University. F. Skorina 2 nmankevich@tut.by; Gomel State University. F. Skorins introduced new concepts in the work: a completely normal index, quite perfect system offunctions. With the help of these concepts, the criteria for solving the two problems of the Hermit-Pad are formulated and proved for the arbitrary system of the degree rows, the obvious determinant representations of the polynomials of the Hermit-Pad 1y and 2nd genus were obtained. The proven statements complement the well -known results in the theory of approximations of the Hermita -Pad. Keywords: Ermita polynomials - a case, a normal index, a perfect system, Gankel determinants. 1. Empress the Hermita-Pad 2nd genus 1.1. Formulation of the problem. Basic definitions. Let F = (F1, ..., fk) - on the boron, consisting of K formal steppe rows f j (z) = ger∑ i = 0 f j i zi+1, j = 1.2 ..., k (1.1) With complex coefficients. A lot of K - dimensional multicindex n = (n1, ..., nk), i.e. streamlined k as follows, denote ZK+. The order of Multotiyndex n = (n1, ..., nk) is the amount | n | : = n1 + ... + nk. Let us fix the non -zero multindex n ∈Zk+ and consider the next task of the Ermite - the case [1; ch. 4, § 3]: The task of A. to find an identical not at zero polynomials = q | n |, degq é | n | Such that for some polynomials P1 = P 1N ,. . . , Pk = p kn, equations r j n (z) = q (z) f j (z) −p j (z) = c j zn j + 1 + were performed. . . , j = 1.2 ..., k. (1.2) The solution to the problem exists [1], and polynomials Q | N | And P J N are accurate to the multiplier factor. Enjoyance can be more significant. It is customary to say [1] that the task A has the only solution if all the solutions of the problem A can be written in the form (λq, λp), where λ ∈C, λ ̸ = 0, a (q, p) is a certain fixed solution. Determination 1.1. If pair (q, p), wherep = (P1,., PK), is a solution to the problem A with the index N ∈ZK+, then polynomial Q, P1 ,. . . , PK is called the polynlines of the Hermit-a parade of the 2nd kind for a set (system) F of formal steppe rows (1.1). A.P. Starovoitov, N.V. Ryabchenko 319 central in the theory of such polynomials are the concepts of a normal index N and the perfect system F (see [1; chap. 4, § 3], [2]). Determination 1.2. The index n ∈ ZK+ is called normal for F regarding the problem A if for any solution (Q, P) the problem A with this index Degq = | N | . Determination 1.3. The system f is called perfect if all indices n ∈Zk+ are normal for F regard to the problem A. It is well known [1] that the normality of the index N is a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of the solution of the problem A. It is not difficult to give an example, which shows that this condition is not A necessary condition for the uniqueness of the solution of the problem A. still does not have an answer to the next question. What are the necessary and sufficient conditions on the index N ∈ ZK+ and the system F, determined by equalities (1.1), in which the task A has the only solution? 1.2. The criterion of the uniqueness of solving the problem A. Since the components of the vector F = {F1 ,. . . , fk} are formal sedate rows, the task is algebraic and, therefore, has an algebraic solution. We introduce the necessary designations. For a nonsense multi -foster n = (n1, ..., nk) and fixed j ∈ {1, 2 ,. . . , k}, in the assumption that n j ̸ = 0, consider the matrix-stripes about 1 × (| n | +1) f J i = (f j-i-1 f j i f J i 1... F j |+i -2 f j | n |+i -1), i = 1 ,. . . , n j; Functional matrix-strips about 1 × (| n | +1) e (z) = (1 z z2... B | n | −1 z | n |), e j (z) = (0 f j 0 f j 0 Z + F J 1.. | N | −2∑ p = 0 f j p z z | n | −p - 2 | n | −1∑ p = 0 f j p z z | n | −p -1); Matrix of order n j × (| n | +1) f j = [f j 1 f j 2. . . F j n j] t =   f j 1 ... f j n j   and matrix fn = [f 1 f 2. . . F k] t order | n | × (| n | +1). Let us also consider the determinants (| n | +1) -th order D J N, I = DET [F 1 F 2. . . F k f j i+n j] t, i = 1.2, .... Determination 1.4. The index n ∈Zk+ will call quite normal for F regarding the problem A if the rank of matrix fn is | N |. Theorem 1.1. In order for the problem zk+ to have the only solution for a fixed index of n ∈ ZK+, it is necessary and enough for the index N to be quite normal regarding the problem A, i.e. Rangfn = | n |. 320 Materials of the School-Conference in the event that Index N is quite normal, with a certain choice of multiplier factor for solving the problem (Q, P) the following determinant representations are true: Q | N | (Z) = DET [F 1 F 2. . . F k e (z)] t, p j n (z) = Det [F 1 F 2. . . F k e j (z)] t, r j n (z) = q | n | (z) f j (z) −p jn (z) = و = 1 d j n, i zn j+i. 2. The polynomials of the Hermita-Pad 1st RO
