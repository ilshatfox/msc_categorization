) INVARIANT REDUCTION  OF BRANCHING EQUATIONS  In real Banach spaces E1, E2 the following bifurcation point problem is considered:  B(x) = R(x, λ), R(0, 0) = 0, R(0, λ) = 0. (1)  Here B : D(B) ⊂ E1 → E2 is a closed linear Fredholm operator with dense in E1 domain D(B), N(B) = span{ϕ1, . . . , ϕn}, N∗(B) = span{ψ1, . . . , ψn},{γj}n1 ∈ E∗1 and {zj}n1 ∈ E2 are corresponding biorthogonal systems. The terminology and notation from [1-3] are used. It is supposed that (1) admits a l-parametrical continuos group G(a), a = (a1, . . . , al) ⊂ D ⊂ Rl, and a discrete group G̃1, i.e. it is invariant with respect to G(a) × G̃1 = G. The subspace E∞−n1 is invariant with respect to L(a).  Condition I. In coordinate representations in En1 = N(B) and N∗(B) the matrices representations Ag and Bg arise and the branching equation (BEq), corresponding to (1), is invariant with respect to Ag and Bg : t(Agτ, λ) = Bgt(τ, λ). The BEq is called potential if the equality f(τ, λ) = d gradτ U(τ, λ) holds with a nonsingular matrix d.  Theorem 1. The potential U(τ, λ) of the G-invariant BEq is an invariant of Ag if A′gdBg = d.  In fact, for τ̃ = Agτ we have DU(τ̃) =< ∇τ̃U(τ̃), dτ̃ >= =< ∇τU(τ), dτ >=< d−1t(τ), dτ > .  Condition II. Let L(a) be a l-parametric continuous group E1 acting l1-optimally in N(B). It means that there exists a basis {ϕi}n1  245    in N(B) such that for any fixed ϕ = ∑n  1 τkϕk ∈ N(B) we can find an a ∈ D and constants r1(τ), . . . , rl1(τ), n− l1 ≤ l such that L(a)ϕ =∑l1  1 rjϕj. The functions rk(τ) are 1-homogeneous invariants of A(a).  Condition II implies an invariant reduction of the BEq to (l1 × n)- or (l1 × l1)-systems. In the last case we say about truncation reduction (TR). The TR is possible under potentiality conditions of the BEq, but sometimes it takes place on its partial potentiality (see the lowest degeneracy cases in the problems about capillary-gravity surface waves and crystallization in statistical crystal theory [2]). In this connection, under BEq reduction realizability, the bifurcation point existence theorem is proved, some connections between partial potentiality of BEq and TR possibility are discussed, and on the base of these results iterational methods are suggested. Our further activity in this direction is divoted to investigation of potentiality problems for resolving systems in bifurcation theory. Our results are supported by RFBR, grant 0101-0019.
