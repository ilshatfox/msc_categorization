. A mixed reverse edge task on Riman surfaces with branches of branching of I. Z. Faizov Kazan State University, fiz@hitv.ru Mixed reverse edge task is to find the region with a partially unknown border and the analytical function in it according to the given boundary conditions. V.N. Monakhov [1] first gave the setting of a mixed reverse edge task relative to the parameter X. He studied the resolution of the problem for areas with a polygonal known border, and then approximation - for arbitrary, hidden boundaries. C. R. Nasirov [2] studied the resolution of the regional task on riman surfaces with an arbitrary border without branches of branching. In this paper, we consider the case when the unknown multi -leafy area DZ in the plane Z (Rimanova surface) contains branching points, and the known part of its border is polygonal. It is assumed that DZ is a single -legged Zordanov region on a polygonal riman surface containing a horizontal half -year, and contains inside the branching points ZJ0, J = 1, p. Its border LZ consists of a well -known arc L 1 Z and the desired arc L2Z, while L 1 Z is a broken with the peaks zk = xk + iyk, k = 1, n, and l2z is such that any straight line is 160
