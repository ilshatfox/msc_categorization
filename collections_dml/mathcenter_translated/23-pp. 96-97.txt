) The regional tasks for one class of semi -linear elliptical equations on riman varieties in this work are studied issues of resolving on the Riman 98 varieties of some of the regional tasks for the semi -linear elliptical equation ∆u = uφ (| u |), (1) where φ (ă)> 0 - 0 - A monotonously increasing, continuously differentiated function at 0 ≤ ă <mm. Let M - complete Rimano diversity, represented in the form of m = b∪d, where B is a certain ancestor with a non -resistant inside, the border ∂b which is a smooth submachine, D isometrically direct work [r0, +∞) × S (where R0> 0 , S - compact Rimanovo diversity without a edge) with a metric DS2 = DR2 + G2 (R) Dθ2 (where G (R)> 0 is smooth on [R0, + inous) function, and dθ2 is a metric on S). We will say that on m resolves the task of the conductor for equation (1) in the class of positive (negative) functions, if for any continuous, positive (negative) on s functions φ (θ) there is a limited solution to this equation U (x), such that lim r → φ u (r, θ) = φ (θ). We introduce the designation i = +ger∫ R0 dt gn -1 (t) t∫ r0 gn -1 (₽) dran, (n = dim m). Theorem 1. The task of the conductor for the equation (1) is solved on M in the class of positive (negative) functions when and only when I <∞. Theorem 2. For any constant a> 0 (a <0) on m \ b, there are whole positive (negative) limited solutions u (r) and v (r) equations (1) that satisfy the regional conditions u | ∂b = a, ∂u ∂ν ∣∣∣∣ ∂b = 0, v | ∂b = 0, ∂v ∂ν ∣∣∣∣ ∂b = a, then and only when I <imes. In addition, there are limr → φ u (r) and limr → ger v (R). The work was carried out with financial support from the Russian Federation (project No. 0301-00304). 99
