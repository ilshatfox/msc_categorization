)  INITIAL SUBSTRUCTURES OF THE STRUCTURE OF n-C. E. DEGREES  One of the principal directions in the study of degrees of unsolvability of sets of Ershov’s difference hierarchy is the development of their structural theory. The first significant result concerning the structures of the n-c. e. degrees for n > 1 distinguishing them from the c. e. degrees was provided by Arslanov [1, 2]: every nonzero n-c. e. degree can be joined to 0′ (i. e., can be cupped) by an incomplete d. c. e. degree. For n = 1, Cooper [3] and Yates (unpublished) had already shown that there exists a nonzero c. e. degree which is not cuppable by any incomplete c. e. degree. This gave a difference between elementary theories of c. e. and n-c. e. degrees for every n > 1.  Other elementary differences between these structures were provided by Downey [4], who proved that the diamond lattice can be embedded into the d. c. e. degrees preserving 0 and 1, while by the Lachlan [5] Nondiamond Theorem, this is not true for the c. e. degrees; and by Cooper, Harrington, Lachlan, Lempp and Soare [6], who established a nondensity result for the n-c. e. degrees, n > 1: for every n > 1, there exists a maximal incomplete n-c. e. degree in the n-c. e. degrees.  For n-c. e. degrees the density problem has some variants. Namely, studying weak density properties of d. c. e. degrees, Cooper, Lempp and Watson [7] showed that for any n > 0 and c. e. degrees c < a there exists a properly n-c. e. degree b such that c < b < a. Cooper and Yi [8] (for n = 2) and Arslanov, LaForte and Slaman [9] (for n > 1) showed that for n ≥ 1 any n-c. e. degree b and any c. e. degree a, a < b, there exists a d. c. e. degree c with a < c < b.  Recently, extending both the weak density theorem of Cooper and Yi and Cooper’s splitting theorem (Cooper [10]), Cooper and Li [11] proved that for any d. c. e. degree a and any c. e. degree b < a, there are d. c. e. degrees x0 and x1 such that b < x0,x1 < a and x0 ∪ x1 = a. Cooper and Li [12] proved that in the n-c. e. degrees (n > 1) Cooper’s splitting theorem cannot be combined with cone avoidance: given n > 1, there exists a n-c. e. degree a and a c. e. degree b such that 0 < b < a, and for any n-c. e. degrees x,y, if x ∪ y = 0′, then either b < x or b < y.  22    Main results of this paper are the following:  Theorem 1. Let E and D be d. c. e. sets and X a c. e. set such that D <T E, X ≤T E, D 6≤T X, and D and E are c. e. in X. Then there exists a d. c. e. set U such that X ≤T U ≤T E and U |T D.  Theorem 2. There are c.e. set D, a d. c. e. set E and a 3-c.e. set F with such that  1) ∅ <T D <T E <T F ; 2) for every 3-c.e. set U ≤T F either U ≤T E, or E ≤T U ⊕D; 3) for every 3-c.e. set U ≤T E either U ≤T D, or D ≤T U .  An important corollary from these two theorems is that the sentence  (∃d > 0)(∃e > d)(∃f > e)(∀u)[[u 6≤ f ∨ u ≤ e ∨ e ≤ u ∪ d] & & [u 6≤ e ∨ u ≤ d ∨ d ≤ u]]  holds in the 3-c. e. degrees and fails in the d. c. e. degrees.

At the heart of his research was a lifelong concern with questions of computability, and in particular the need to find out more about the interface, both in the mathematics of the real world and in relation to the human mind, between computability and incomputability - the existence of unsolvable problems ha
