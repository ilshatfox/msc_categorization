) The numerical modeling of the movements of the lev-shows of the course of the CHEL-Show is the two-dimensional currents of the viscous incompetent fluid with the mobile border [1], Ch. 4. In this work, the effect of destroying the solutions of the regional problems of the regional problems of the CHEL-show in the classical case and in the case when the liquid flows an obstacle. If the moving liquid has only one source (drain), then the mathematical model can be built as follows. Model 1. Let F0 (Z) - analytical and unambiguous on the set U = {z ∈ C: | z | ≤ 1} Function and Q (t) - continuous at t ≥ 0 function. It is necessary to find the function f (z, t), analytical and unambiguous in z in u and continuously differentiated by t with t ≥ 0, satisfying the conditions of re (1 z ∂f ∂t ∂f ∂z) = Q (t), z ∈ ∂u, t ∈ [0, t), (1) f (z, 0) = f0 (z), z ∈ U, (2) f (0, t) = 0, t ∈ [0, T). (3) 219 is known [2], [3] that this task is poorly determined in the case when the intensity Q (t) <0. In particular, it is proved that the classic solutions of the type F (z, t) = n∑ k = 1 ak (t) z k (4) are always destroyed in some final time. To trace the appearance of features in such solutions, a numerical model was built. By substituting (4) B (1), we get n∑ l = 1 n∑ l = k a′l (t) ak (t) z l --k = q (t), z ∈ ∂u, t ∈ [0, t) . (5) It follows that the desired functions of AK (T) satisfy the non -linear system of differential equations that are not allowed relative to derivatives, and some initial conditions A1 (0) = A10 ,. . . an (0) = an0. When solving a non -linear system at every step, you have to turn a filled matrix. It is convenient to use the method of numerical integration of Merson, which has the fifth order of accuracy, and the method of UL factory. It is significant that the degree of polynoma cannot be chosen too much (about 102), which is associated with the loss of stability of the method of circulation of the matrix. Various techniques are proposed to eliminate the poor conditioning of the task. The method of kinetic freezing [4] boils down to the suppression of large speeds that occur at the border close to destruction. In this case, the mathematical model has the following look. Model 2. Find the function f (z, t), analytical and unambiguous in z in u and continuously differentiated by t, and the function Wreg (z, t), analytical in z and continuous in t, satisfying the conditions Re (1 z ∂f ∂T ∂F ∂Z) = Q (t) + re (zwreg), z ∈ ∂u, t ∈ [0, T), (6) 220 IM (zwreg) = α∂θ (∣∣∣∣ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂z ∣∣∣∣ −1 [q (t) + re (zwreg)]) (7) and conditions (2) and (3), where α is the regulatory parameter, Z = R Exp (Iθ). In [4] it is shown that this task has the only local solution in time. Consider a generalization of the classic task of a chele show in case the viscous fluid flows a motionless obstacle. In the simplest case, you can change the law that the speed of the moving fluid is subordinated by replacing the dependence of V = ∇p by V = χP, (8) where χ is some piece-to-stand function. Note that the formula (8) is poorly justified. Model 3. Find the function f (z, t) that satisfies the condition of re (1 z ∂f ∂t ∂f ∂z) = χ [f (z)] q (t), z ∈ ∂u, t ∈ [0, T). (9) and conditions (2), (3). During calculations, condition (9) was transformed according to the Schwartz formula and the analytical connection was used between the Schwartz integral and Hilbert's singular integral. Gilbert's transformation is implemented using two quick Fourier transformations. Time derivatives and spatial variable are approximated, respectively, two- and four-point variable templates. One of the calculated cases is shown in Fig. 1. Another approach to the task with the obstructing obstacle is based on the assumption that the function that imitates the obstacle is considered as the regulatory parameter. Model 4. Let the continuous function of the complex argument α (Z) be set. It is required to find the functions f (z, t) and Wreg (z, t), 221 satisfying the conditions (6), IM (zwreg) = α [f (z, t)] (∣∣∣∣ ∂f ∂z ∣∣∣z ∣∣∣z ∣∣∣z ∣∣∣z ∣∣∣z ∣∣∣z ∣∣∣z ∣∣∣z ∣∣∣z ∣∣∣z ∣∣∣z ∣ −1 (q (t) + re (zwreg)) (10) and conditions (2), (3). The numerical model of this task is built by analogy with the model 3. Condition (10) is transformed to the singular integradifferent equation with Hilbert's core. To solve it, the method of simple iterations is used. It was found that the algorithm loses stability already at α ≈ 1. This situation is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 1. Fig. 2. Literature [1] Batchalor J.
