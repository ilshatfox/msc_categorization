Gumilyov; The Ural Federal University in the article discusses the spacecraft of periodicals of the variables and the space of Nikolsky -Besov. Assessments of the best approximation by trigonometric polynomas with the numbers of harmonics from the hyperbolic cross of the functions of the Nikolsky -Besov class were obtained. Keywords: Lorentz's space, Nikolsky -Besov’s class, approximation of function, hyperbolic cross. Let RM-M-Minar Euclidean space of points X̄ = (X1,., XM) with material coordinates; IM = {x̄ ∈ RM; 0 ≤ x j ≤ 1; j = 1 ,. . . , m}-M-dimensional cube, tm = [0.2π] m. Through LP, τ (TM), we denote the space of the Lorentz of all the functions f (x̄) measurable according to the Lebeg, which have a period of 2π for each variable and for which the value is ∥ f ∥p, τ = {τ p ∫ 1 0 (f ∗ (t) ) τ t τ p −1d t} 1 τ, 1 <p <mm, 1 ≤ τ <φ is final, where f ∗ (y) is an irrepressive rearrangement of function | f (2πx̄) |, x̄ ∈ IM (see [1], p. 228). In the case of τ = P, the space of the Lip Lp, τ (TM) coincides with the space of the LP (TM) label with the norm ∥ f ∥p = ∥ f ∥p, p. Functions F ∈ L1 (TM) = L (I M) compare its row Fourier∑ ngrm an (f) ei 〈n, 2πx〉, where an (f) - Fourier functions f ∈ L1 (TM) by multiple trigonometric the system {ei 〈n, 2πx〉} zm, and ZM is an integer grille in RM. Put 〈ȳ ȳ, x̄〉 = m∑ j = 1 y j x j, Δs (f, x) = ∑ norn (s) an (f) ei 〈n, x〉, where ρ (s̄) = {k1 (k1 , ..., km) ∈Zm: [2s j - 1] ≤ ∣∣k j ∣∣ <2s j, s j ∈Z+, j = 1, ..., m} and [a] - a whole part of the number a. The numerical sequence {an} n organm, ∈ LP, 1 é p <+inous, if ∥∥ {an} n organm∥∥lp = {∑ nphm ∣∣an∣∣p} 1 p <+φ. G. Akishev 13 Let R̄ = (R1, ..., Rm), R j> 0, j = 1.2, ..., m, 1 é θ é φ. Consider the space of all functions f ∈ LP, τ (TM), for which ger∑ s̄∈Zm+ 2 〈S, r θ θ θ || ΔS̄ (f) || θp, τ <mm. This space is indicated by the symbol S R̄ P, τ, θ B and is called the space of Nikolsky -Besov. In this space, we consider the unit ball s r p, τ, θb = {f ∈ ° lp, τ (t m): ∥∥ f ∥∥p, τ+ ∥∥∥∥ ∥∥∥∥ 〈s, r〉 ∥∥δS (f ) ∥∥p, τ} s̄∈Zm+ ∥∥∥∥ lθ é 1}. Для данного вектора r̄ = (r1, ...,rm) положим γ̄= r̄r1 ,r j > 0 и  Q (γ̄) n =∪〈s̄,γ̄〉<nρ(s̄), T (Q  (γ̄) n ) = {T (x̄) =  ∑ k̄∈Q(γ̄)n  bk̄ e i 〈k̄,x̄〉}. Let e ​​(γ) n (f) p, τ - the best approximation of the function f ∈ LP, τ (TM) polynomas from the set T (Q (γ̄) n). In the space of the LP (TM) Lebaga for the class of Nikolsky -Besov SR̄P, θb, the exact approximation of the best approaches in the space of LQ (TM) was established by V.N. Temlyakov [5], E.M. Galeev, A.S. Romanyuk and others (see Bibliography in [2]-[4]). It is known that for the spaces of the Lorentz, the inclusion of LQ, τ2 (t m) ⊂ lp, τ1 (tm) in the case of 1 <p <q <φ, 1 <τ2, τ2 <φ and lp, τ2 (tm) ⊂ lp, τ1, τ1 (TM), if 1 <τ2 <τ1 <imes. The main goal of the article is to find the exact order of the size E (γ̄) n (s r̄ p, τ1, θ b) q, τ2 in different ratios between parameters p, q, τ1, τ2, θ. Record an ≍ BN means that there are positive numbers C1, C2, which are not dependent on n ∈N, such as C1 an é Bn ≤c2 an. The main results are the following statements. Theorem 1. Let 1 <p <mm, 1 <τé 2 or 2 <p <mm, 2 ≤ τ <mm. Then, for any function F ∈ LP, τ (TM) there is an inequality ∥ f ∥p, τ éc (∑ s̄ăzm+ ∥δs̄ (f) ∥τ0p, τ) 1 τ0, where τ0 = min {2, τ}. To prove this theorem, analogues of Lemm 1.1.2 [5] for multiple sums are first set and then the Littlewood -Pali theorem is used in the space of Lorentz. Theorem 2. Let 1 <p <φ, 1 <τ2 é é é é2 <τ1 and the function f ∈ LP, τ1 (TM) satisfies the condition ∑ s̄ root (m∑ j = 1 (s j +1)) τ2 ( 1τ2-1τ1) ∥δS̄ (f) ∥τ2p, τ1 <mm, 14 Materials of the School-Conference then F ∈ LP, τ2 (TM) and the inequality is performed ∥ f ∥p, τ2 é ∑ s̄∈Zm+ (m∑ j = 1 (s j +1)) τ2 (1τ2 - 1τ1) ∥δS̄ (f) ∥τ2p, τ1 1/τ2. The proof of this theorem follows from theorem 1 and inequalities of different metrics for trigonometric polynomas in the space of Lorentz [5]. Put γ̄ ′ = (γ′1, ..., γ ′ m) and we will assume that γ ′ j = γ j, j = 1, ..., ν and γ j -1 <γ ′ j <γ j. , j = ν+1, ..., m. Theorem 3. Let r̄ = (r1, ..., rm), 0 <r1 = ... = rν <rν+1 ≤ ... ≤ rm, 1 <p <τé 2 or 2 <p <∞ and 2 é τé 2, 1 é θ éimes. If 2 <p <mm and 2 é τ <φ, then e (γ̄ ′) n (s r̄ p, τ, θb) p, τ ≍ 2 —Nr1n (ν - 1) (1 2– 1θ)+, n ∈N, where a+ = max {0, a}. If 1 <p <τé and 1, then e (γ̄ ′) n (s r̄ p, τ, θb) p, τ ≍ 2 − nr1n (ν - 1) (1 τ - 1 θ)+, n, n, n ∈N. To prove this theorem, the theorem 1. Theorem 4. Let r̄ = (r1, ..., rm), 0 <r1 = ... = rν <rν+1 ≤ ... ≤ rm, 1 <p <mm, 1 <τ2 é 2 and τ2 <τ1 <φ, 1 é θ <mm. Then e (γ̄) n (s r̄ p, τ1, θ b) p, τ2 éc 2 - nr1n (m - 1) (1 τ2 - 1 θ) ++ (1τ2 - 1 τ1), n ​​∈N, where a+ = max {0, a}. To prove this theorem, the theorem 2. Theorem 5. Let 1 é p <q <mm, 1 é τ1, τ2 <mm. If the function f ∈ LP, τ1 (tm) and ∑ S
