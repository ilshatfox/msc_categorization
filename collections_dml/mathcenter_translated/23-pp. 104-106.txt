The relationship of some classes of functions, let 1 <p <mm, k> 0, β1> β> 0, σ (λ (s), f) - a number of functions F, transformed by the sequence λ (s) = {λ (s, k, 1/n) = (∫ 2π 1/n α (t) dt + nks ∫ 1/n 0 α (t) tksdt) 1/s <mm, n = 1, 2 ,. . .}, for which we consider 0 <∫ 2π 0 α (t) tksdt <mm, α (t) - a non -negative function on [0, 2π] (that is, if a number of functions f (x) ∈ L0p is recorded in the actual form ∑و n = 1 (an cos nx + bn sin nx) ≡ ∑ et n = 1 an (x), then a row is called a row converted by a row (λ (s), f): = ∑و n = 1 λ (s, k, 1/n) an (x)); QM is a class of functions, the sequence of factors of the Fourier is quasimonotones, that is, there is a number ≥ 0, such that ann --ρ ↓ 0 (n → ∞); Λ is a class of functions, the sequences of the Fourier coefficients are lacunar, that is, they are non -negative and equal to zero, if n 6 = 2k, k = 0, 1, 2,. . . ; ∗ (δ) - continuous, non -negative on [0, 2π] function, 106 possesses the properties: ∗ (Δ1) ≤ c1 accord (Δ2), 0 ≤ Δ1 ≤ Δ2 ≤ 2π; ∗ (2δ) C2 ≤ ∗ (Δ), 0 ≤ Δ ≤ π, where the positive constant C1, C2 do not depend on Δ, Δ1, Δ2; SWBH (θ, τ, p, k, β1) is a class of functions f ∈ LP, for which there is a function ψ ∈ LP with a number σ (λ (τ), f) and (δ (k+β) θ λθ (τ, k, β) · ∫ 2π δ ωθk+β1 (ψ, t)/(t (k+β) θλθ (τ, k, t) t) 1/θ ¿¿¿¿¿(Δ), for any Δ ∈ [0, π]; SBH (τ, p, k, β) is a class of functions f ∈ LP, such as (∫ δ 0 t -τk - 1 ∫ t 0 α (u) uτkduωτk+β (f, t) p) 1/τ ¿ ∗ (δ), for any Δ ∈ [0, π]. Statement. I. If 0 <θ ≤ min (2, p), max (2, p) ≤ τ <mm, then 1) sbh (β, p, k, β) ⊆ swbh (τ, θ, p, k, β , β1); 2) sbh (τ, p, k, β) ⊇ swbh (θ, τ, p, k, β, β1); II.

Fedotov (Kazan, Fedotov@mi.ru) The norm of the Lagrange operator in the multidimensional spaces of Sobolev Let HS (s ∈ R) - the space of Sobolev functions m variables with the usual norm. We will assume the condition s> m/2, which ensures the investment of HS in the space of continuous functions. We fix N = (n1, n2, ..., nm) ∈ NM, enter into [−π, π] m mesh of equivalent nodes ∆n = {tk = (tk1, tk2, ..., tkm) | tk ∈ Zm, | kj | ≤ nj, j = 1, 2, ..., m} and designate the lagrange operator through PN, compares each function U ∈ HS trigonometric interpolation (pnu) (τ) = ∑ tkorn u (tk) m∏ j = 1 sin ((2nj + 1) (τj - tkj)/2) (2nj + 1) sin ((τj - tkj)/2), τ ∈ [−π, π] m. In [1] it is shown that with m = 1 ‖pn‖hs → hs ≤ √ 1 + ζ (2s), where ζ (t) = ∑icle l = 1 l –t. In [2] This result is generalized in case M ≥ 2. Namely, in this case ‖pn‖hs → Hs ≤ 2 m --S 2 m s + 1 2 m (n, s) √ 1 + ζ (2s --m + 1), 108
