Agafonov2 1 ignatev-yurii@mail.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University 2 A.A.Agathonov@gmail.com; Kazan (Volga) Federal University based on a qualitative analysis of cosmological models with phantom scalar fields with self -activity identified and clarified their distinctive features. Key words: phantom scalar field, quality analysis. The function of the lambgange of the phantom scalar field with mass M and by self -use has the form: l = - 1 8π (g i kφ, iφ, k + m2φ2 + α 2 φ4), where the α is the constant of self -activity. We will write out the self-composed equations of the spatial-flat cosmologic model D S2 = D T 2 —A2 (T) (D X2 +D Y2 +D Z2)-Einstein equation 3 ȧ2 A2 = −φ̇2 +m2φ2 +α 2 φ4 +λ (1) and The equation of the massive phantom scalar field with cubic nonlinearity: φ̈+3 ȧ a φ̇ --m2 ∗ ∗ φ = 0. (2) 160 materials of the international school-conference, using the constant habblah can be expressed from the Einstein equation through the functions φ, φ̇ dimensionless comphaned time (mt = τ) and conducting the standard replacement of the variables φ ′ = z (t), we bring the field equation to the type of normal autonomous system of ordinary differential equations on the plane {φ, z}: φ = x; Z = y; p (x, y) = y; Q (x, y) = - p 3 √ λm - y2 +x2 +αm 2 x4y +x +αm x3. (3) Special points of the dynamic system are determined by equations (see, e.g., [1]): m: p (x, y) = 0; Q (x, y) = 0. (4) at any values ​​of αm and λm ≥ 0 system of algebraic equations has one trivial solution: x = 0; y = 0 ⇒ m0 (0.0). (5) in the case of αm <0, in addition, non -trivial symmetrical solutions are also possible: x = x ± = ± 1p --αm; y = 0 ⇒ m ± (x ±, 0). (6) Calculate derivatives of functions (3) at a zero special point (5) at λm> 0: ∂p ∂x ∣∣∣∣ m0 = 0; ∂p ∂y ∣∣∣∣ m0 = 1; ∂q ∂x ∣∣∣∣ m0 = 1; ∂q ∂y ∣∣∣∣ m0 = - √ 3λm. Thus, we obtain a characteristic equation (see [2]): ∣∣∣∣∣∣ − − 1 1 --λ -p3λm ∣∣∣∣∣∣ = 0 ⇒ λ ± = - p 3λm 2 ± p 3λm +4 2 so that: λ+λ - = −1 (7) - both of their own values ​​are material and have opposite signs. It is not difficult to see that the own vectors λ-matrix are rthotonal: u ± = (λ ±, 1) ⇒ (u+, u-u-) = 0. (8) Thus, according to the qualitative theory of dynamic systems on the plane, the dynamic system we examined in the case ofλm> 0 always has a saddler (4), which is unstable in any direction of time. In the case of α> 0, this point is the only special point of the dynamic system. Derivatives of functions (3) at special points (6) at λm> 0 are equal: ∂p ∂x ∣∣∣∣ m ± = 0; ∂p ∂y ∣∣∣∣ m ± = 1; ∂q ∂x ∣∣∣∣ m ± = −2; ∂q ∂y ∣∣∣∣ m ± = p 3 √ λm - 1 2αm. SOUTH. Ignatiev, A.A. Agafonov 161 characteristic equations for both special points coincide and their own points have one type: ∣∣∣∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣∣∣∣ λ 1 1 –λ - p 3 √ λm - 1 2αm ∣∣∣∣∣∣∣ = 0 ⇒λ ± = = 0 - p 3 √ λm - 1 2αm 2 ± p 3 √ λm - 1 2αm - 8 3 2. (9) The sexual expression in the first member (9) is strictly larger than zero, therefore three cases are possible (see [3]): 1) λ1/2αM −8/3> 0 - then both own values ​​are material and negative. In this case, the solution contains two symmetrical attractive (stable) unbearable nodes. All phase trajectories in the vicinity of such special points at T → ° are included in these points and, in addition to two exceptional, relate to their own minimum length vector. Own vectors are again determined by the formula (8), into which it is necessary to substitute the corresponding own values ​​from (9). It is easy to show that U+is such a minimum length vector. 2) λm −1/2αm −8/3 = 0 - then both own values ​​are negative and equal. In this case, the solution contains two symmetric degenerated nodes. 3) λm - 1/2αm -8/3 <0 - then both of their own values ​​are comprehensively conjugated, and their real parts are negative. In this case, the solution contains two symmetrical attractive focus. Rice. 1.
