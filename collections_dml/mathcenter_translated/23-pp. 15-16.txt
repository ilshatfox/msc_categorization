Amazing extensions of the fields of algebraic numbers amazing expansion of the field of algebraic numbers is any existential closed field in the classroom of all counting underpants of the rings of the adels of this field. The main properties of such fields are the justice for them of the local-global principle of Hasse for entire points of diversity and the properties of maximumness (lack of their own algebraic extensions). The elementary theory of such fields is complete and permitted. Algebraic and theoretico model properties of amazing extensions will be described and their application is indicated to build an effective version of the global theory of classes of classes. M.I.

Algebra Frank T (M) = T has a z2 grading: t = t0 ⊕ t1, where t0 = w + sl (u) ⊗ o, t1 = u ⊗ ω1, u is the vector space of dimension 2, o (1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: m), W = w (1: m) - whether algebra of special differentiations of algebra O. Theorem 1. Let m - maximum maximum maximum permanence 3 in T (M). Then either m = t (0)-the standard maximum subpalgra, or m resolved and t/m-an ignorant M-module. Theorem 2. Let g = aut t-a group of automorphisms algebra t, g = alge g-whether the group G, g = g0 ⊕ g1 is the corresponding z2-grading, then g0 ∼ = SL (u) ⊗o + line aut w, G1 ∼ = T1, (3), 17 Where T1, (3) = T1 ∩ T (3), T (3)-the third member of the standard filtering of the algebra T.

Semenova (Novosibirsk, Semenova@math.nsc.ru) Convex geometry: The investigation in the lattices of closed subsets and the existence of decompositions of convex geometry is called the scope of the anti -reservation (X, φ), which meets the property of the anti -residence: x ∈ ivil (a ∪ {Y }) \ A attracts y /∈ ∈ (A ∪ {X}) for any closed A ⊆ x and any x 6 = Y in x, as well as the property φ (∅) = ∅. Through CL (x, ∗), we denote the lattice of the subsets, which is closed to the X. The next result is classic (see for example [1] and [2]). Theorem 1. For the final lattice l, the following conditions are equivalent: 1) l isomorphic Cl (x, gment) for some convex geometry (x, gment); 2) l semi -displayed up and half -permissive down; 3) Each element in L present the only way in the form of an unusual unification of indecent elements, i.e., L has the only non -18
