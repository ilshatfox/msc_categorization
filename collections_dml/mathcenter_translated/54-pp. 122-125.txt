Materials of the International School-Conference UDC 517.54 Logarithmic coefficients and the norm of the derivative of the Schwartz harmonic functions S.Yu. Graph1 1 sergey.graf@tversu.ru; Tver State University, Petrozavodsk State University received estimates of logarithmic coefficients and derivatives in linear and affiliates-invariant families preserving the orientation of harmonic displays of a single circle. Estimates of the family order in the terms of the Supremum are proved by the norms of Schwartz derivatives in the families in question. The connection of these results with sufficient conditions of single -leafness of harmonic functions is discussed. Key words: harmonic display, Schwartz derivative, linearine families. Any local single -leaf -preserving orientation harmonic in the circle d = {z ∈C: | z | <1} The function f (z) has the form f (z) = h (z)+ g (z), where h (z) = ger∑ k = 0 ak z k, g (z) = ger k = 1 bk z k, (1) dilatation ω (z) = g ′ (z)/h ′ (z) analytical and | ω (z) | <1 in D. The classic derivative of the Schwartz (Schwarzian) is locally single -leaf analytic function H (see, for example, [1]) is defined as SH (Z) = (H ′ ′ (Z) H ′ (Z) ′ - 1 2 (h ′ ′ (z) h ′ (z)) 2. Attempts to summarize the concept of Schwartz derivative in case of harmonic functions have been made repeatedly (see, for example, [2, 3]). In particular, in [3] R. Ernandez and M. Martin, a fairly successful determination of the Schwartz derivative for arbitrary single -leafful harmonic functions of the species (1): s f (z) = (p f (z) z - 1 2 (p f f (z). (z)) 2, where p f (z) = ∂ ∂z ln (| h ′ (z) | 2 - | g ′ (z) | 2). This definition maintains the basic properties of the classic Schwartz derivative. The norm of the Schwarzian harmonic function F is determined by equality || S f || = SUP Zorn | S F (Z) | (1 - | Z | 2) 2. The family l locally single-leafy preserving the orientation of harmonic vdfunctions of the species (1), i.e. a0 = a1−1 = 0, is called linear-index (L.I.S.), S.Yu. Graph 123 If for any function f ∈L F (φ (z)) - f (φ (0)) fz (φ (0)) φ ′ (0) ∈L ∀φ (z) = eiθ z +a 1+ az, a ∈D, θ ∈R. The family of L is called affiliate-invariant (A.I.S.), if f (z)+ε f (z) 1+εb1 ∈L ∀ ε ∈D. An essential role in the theory of affiliate and linear-invariant families is played by the concept of the order of the family, defined by T. Sheil Small [4] as α = Sup F ∈L | A2 |. In [5], the concept of an updated order of A.L.I.S. L: α0 = sup f ∈L 0 | a2 | where l 0 = {f ∈ L: b1 = 0}. The clarified order in some cases is more convenient than α. We also determine β0 = SUP F ∈L 0 | B2 |. Note that α0 ≤ α and β0 ≤ 1/2 for any A.L.I.S. L. Theorem 1 [6]. For any function F ∈L and Z ∈D | p f (z) | ≤ 2 α0 +| z | 1 - | z | 2. The assessment is accurate, for example, in A.L.I.S. convex or close to convex harmonic display. Consider the arbitrary A.L.I.S. L and f = h + g ∈ L 0. We determine the locally single -line analytical function Fε (z) = h (z) + εg (z) in D with the arbitrary value ε, | ε | ≤ 1. Let φε (z) = ln f ′ ε (z) = ger k = 1 ck (ε) z k. We call CK (ε) by logarithmic coefficients f. Theorem 2 [6]. Let the local-one-leaf harmonic function F ∈L 0 and | ε | ≤ 1. Then | ck (ε) | ≤ min rative (0.1) ck (ε, r) <ck   ε, √ k −1 k +1 , where ck (ε, r) = 2 kr k - 2 (1 - r 2)  α0 +β0 r +| ε | 1+r | ε | r - r α0+β0 r+| ε | 1+r | ε |  . Theorem 2 allows you to evaluate in l 0 the functionality of the fecti-sego, which plays a key role in assessing the norms of the Schwarzian function F: for any function f ∈L 0, is true inequality∣∣a3 –A22∣∣≤ 13 (α20 + min Rorn (0 , 1) C2 (0, R)). 124 Materials of the International School-Conference by the consequence of this assessment is the theorem 3 [6]. For any function F ∈L || S f || ≤ 2 (α20 +min Rorn (0.1) C2 (0, R)) <2α20 +3 (p 3α0 +β0 - 1p 3α0 +β0). The reverse task is to assess the order of A.L.I.S. L, if the assessment of the norm of the Schwarz derivative in this family is known. This task is important for constructing sufficient conditions of one -leafness of harmonic functions. Theorem 4 [6]. Let - A.L.I.S. Harmonic functions, and there is a constant c such that SUP F ∈L | p f (z) (1- | z | 2) | ≤c +2 | z |. Then α0 ≤ c2, α≤ c+12. The assessment is accurate, for example, in the family of convex harmonic display. A similar result is fair in the terms of Supremum Schwarzian norms in the L. Theorem 5 [6]. Let - A.L.I.S. harmonic functions, and there is a constant C such that SUP F ∈L || S f || ≤c. Then: (i) for any function F ∈L 0 | A3 —A22 | ≤c /6 and for f ∈L | a3 —A22 | ≤ (C +2α0 +3/2)/6; (II) The order of the family satisfies the inequality α≤ (1+ P 8+ 2C)/2. The message is supposed to discuss the above results, as well as some related to them, including the conditions of one -leafness of the harmonic function in terms of its derivative of Schwartz.
