Sabitov1 1 sabitov_fmf@mail.ru; Sterlitamak branch of the Institute of Strategic Research of the Republic of Belarus, Sterlitamak branch of the Bashkir State University for the equation of fluctuations in the final beam studied the initial-border tasks and the initial task for the endless beam. Problem solutions are constructed in explicitly and the corresponding theorems of uniqueness and existence in the class of regular decisions have been proved. Key words: the equation of the beam, initial-border tasks, the initial task, the spectral method, unity, existence, row, stability. Many tasks about fluctuations in rods, beams and plates, which are important in construction mechanics, theory of stability of rotating shafts and vibration of ships lead to differential equations of a higher order. Let the beam L length L for certainty are based on two supports using pin devices. Under the influence of the continuous external power of G (X, T), designed for a unit of length, forced bending transverse fluctuations of a homogeneous beam, in the absence of rotational movement during bend, are described by an equation of a fourth order [1, p. 141 - 143], [2, p. 278 - 280] ρsut t +e juxxxx = g (x, t), K.B. Sabitov 309 where ρ is the linear density of the beam, s is the cross -sectional area, e is the elasticity module of the material, the moment of inertia of the section relative to its horizontal axis, which we rewritten in the following form: lu ≡ ut t +α2uxxxx = f (x, t) , (1) where α2 = E J/ρS, f (x, t) = G (x, t)/ρS. Note that equation (1) comes to many tasks when calculating the stability of rotating shafts and studying the vibration of ships [3]. To determine the oscillation (displacement) u (x, t) points of the beam, you need to set boundary conditions at the ends of x = 0 and x = l. The type of additional boundary conditions depends on the method of fixing the corresponding end. If both ends are supported, i.e. They can freely rotate around the consolidation point, then in this place the bending moment should be zero. In this case, we have conditions U (0, t) = uxx (0, t) = u (l, t) = uxx (l, t) = 0, 0 ≤ t ≤ t. (2) and in the case of a beam from The borders of the beam and horizontality of the tangent at the ends: u (0, t) = ux (0, t) = u (l, t) = ux (l, t) = 0, 0 ≤ t ≤ t ≤ t ≤ t ≤ t ≤ t ≤ t ≤ T. (3) If both ends are free, then in this case the bending moment and the tangential force UXX (0, t) = uxxx (0, t) = uxx (l, t) = uxxx (l, t) should be zero at the ends. ) = 0, 0 ≤ T ≤ T. (4) If the end x = 0 is tightly covered, and the other end X = L is free, then we have the following boundary conditions: U (0, T) = UX (0, T) = uxx (l, t) = uxxx (l, t) = 0, 0 ≤ t ≤ t. (5) if the end x = 0 is articulated, and the other is shut up tightly, then u (0, t) = uxx (0, t) = u (l, t) = ux (l, t) = 0, 0 ≤ t ≤ t. (6) other boundary conditions are possible. As for the initial conditions, they are the same as in the case of the string equation: u (x, t) | t = 0 = onic (x), ut (x, t) | t = 0 = ψ (x), 0 ≤ x ≤ l. (7) In this work, for equation (1), the following initial-border tasks in the rectangular area D = {(X, T) | 0 <x <l, 0 <t <t}, where L and T are the given positive numbers. Initial-border tasks. To in the field (x, t) with the following properties: u (x, t) ∈C 4,2X, t (D); (8) lu (x, t) ≡ f (x, t), (x, t) ∈ D; (9) 310 materials of the International School-Conference satisfies the initial conditions (7) and one of the boundary conditions (2)-(6), where f (x, t), onic (x) and ψ (x) are given fairly smooth functions . Note that in the works [2, p. 277], [3], [4, ch. VI] [5, p. 45], [6, p. 35], [7, p. 151], [8, p. 25] By separating variables, the own frequencies (own values) and forms of own oscillations (own functions) for the equation (1) for F (X, T) = 0 with boundary conditions (2) - (6) were found. Questions about the substantiation of the correctness of the initial-border tasks set by us have not been studied. Interest in these tasks is caused by the author of the article of the construction of specialists in construction mechanics with a request to build in explicitly a solution to the tasks. The theory of vibrations of rods and beams, even simplified by discarding insignificant values,
