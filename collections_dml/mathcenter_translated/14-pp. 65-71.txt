) Sufficient conditions for solvability of the homogeneous regional problem of Riemann with an endless index in the complex plane Contour L, consisting of m deployed in the infinity of rays LJ = {Arg Z = βj}, 0 = β1 <β2 <. . . <βm <2π. We denote DJ = {βj <arg z <βj+1}, j = 1, m, βm+1 = 2π. Consider the homogeneous regional task of Riemann, consisting in finding all limited layerly analytical functions φ (z) with a line of jumps L, continuous boundary values ​​of which satisfy the linear ratio φ+(t) φ - (t), t ∈ L \ {∞}. (1) the given coefficient G (t) of the task is subordinated to the conditions (j = 1, m): arg g (t) = 2π venting (t) | t | ρj, t ∈ LJ, 0 <ρj <mm, ∈) Hlj (µj), ∗j (urb) = λj 6 = 0; (2) 71 ln | g (t) | ∈ HLJ. (3) From the conditions (2) it follows that the coefficient G (t) has the task at each of the rays of LJ at the point t = و Sures of the steppe order ρj [1], p. 512. We denote J+(j -) those indices J, for which the inequality λj> 0 (λj <0) is performed, and B is the class of limited pieces of analytical functions continuous on many dj \ {∞}. The method of solving the problem of Riemann with an endless index of the power order in the event of one -sided twisted N.V. Govorov [2]. Sufficient conditions for solvability of the problem (1) in class B in the case of bilateral twisted on the material axis were obtained in [3], for m rabs - in [4], [5]. In this work, statements announced in [5]. Lemma 1. Any limited solution to the problem of Riman is represented in the form of φ (z) = x (z) f (z), (4) where x (z) is a canonical function set by the formula x (z) = m∏ j = 1 Exp {1 2πi ∫ lj∩ {| z | 61} ln g (τ) dτ τ τ - z + + z [ρj] +1 2πi ∫ lj∩ {| z |> 1} ln g (τ) dτ [ρj] +1 (τ - z)} ≡ m∏ j = 1 xj (z), (5) a f (z) - a certain function of the order not higher ρ = max j {ρj}. Lemma is proved in [4], and in [5] the indicator HX (θ) of canonical function is indicated. Theorem 1. For the existence of an infinite set of limited solutions to the problem of Riman (1), the coefficient of which is subordinated to the ratios (2), (3), the fulfillment of one of the conditions: 1) all the turnover coefficients are positive and the inequalities of Max J {0, (2ρj - (2ρj - 1) (2ρj + 1) −1} <µj j = 1, (6) where µj is the Helder indicators from conditions (2); 2) ρ <σ ∗ = minl π (βjl+1 - βj) −1 and the HX (θ) indicator is negative at points θ = βγl, i.e., hx (βjl) <0, l = 1, r, (7 ) where JL, L = 1, R, R 6 M, - the marked indices J+, i.e. ρjl = ρjl> 0, which are in terms of increasing. 72 3) ρ <σ ∗ and with some natural n resolve relatively unknown ∆k> 0 and ϑk ∈ [0, 2π] One of the systems of inequalities (l = 1, r): a) π sin ρπ n∑ k = 1 ∆ k cos ρ (| βjl - ϑk | - π) <–hx (βjl) if ρ 6 = [ρ]; (8) b) −π ρ n∑ k = 1 ∆k sin ρ (βjl - ϑk) <–hx (βjl), if ρ = [ρ]; (9) 4) ρ - = max j - {ρj -} <min s {βj+s+1 - βj+s) −1} = σ̃, (ρj+s - σ) (1+ρj+s - σ) −1 <µj, ρ - <σ <σ̃, (10) where J+S are those J+indexes that are inhabited in the order of increasing order, for which ρj+> ρ-. Proof. 1) If λj> 0, j = 1, m, then in class B, each of the homogeneous tasks with the gj (t) coefficient is solved on the Lj [2], p. 154. The solution of the problem on L in this case, obviously, will be the work of solutions to the corresponding problems on LJ. For example, the solutions to the problem (1) are the functions of the type [2], c. 165, 189, φ (z) = m∏ j = 1 exp {z 2πi ∫ lj (ln g (τ) - 2πinj (τ) dτ τ (τ - z)} (11) where those who consider zero zj, n, n = rj, neiβj Solutions set by the formula nj (τ) = [max 06x6 | τ | (∗j (xe iβj) xρj + 1/2)]. 2) The indicator of the canonical function is a trigonometrically ρ-spray function on each of the segments [βjl, βjl+1], l = 1, r. Therefore, from conditions 2) it follows [3] that hx (θ) <0 for θ ∈ [βjl, βjl+1]. Therefore, the canonical function has an exponential desire for zero at z → urb. Therefore, a limited solution to the problem will be any function of the species (4), where F (Z) is an arbitrary whole function of order ρf <ρ. 3) If the system is allowed (8), then you can build a family of entire functions F0 (Z) with zeros on the rays Arg z = ϑk and densities ∆K in order ρ, such as hf0 (θ) = π sin ρπ n∑ k = 1 ∆K cos ρ (| θ - ϑk | - π), 0 6 θ 6 2π, 73 and HF0 (βjl) <–hx (βjl). (12) Then the solution to the problem (1) of the type φ0 (z) = x (z) f0 (z) (13) will have a negative indicator on βjl rays. From here, as shown in 2), it follows that φ0 (z) is a limited solution to a homogeneous problem. If the system (9) has a solution, then you can build an infinite number of whole functions F0 (Z), the zeros of which lie on the rays Arg Z = ϑK and Arg Z = ϑK + πρ and 1, and the modules of zeros on each pair of rays are the same and have density ∆K in an updated manner ρ (r) = ρ + (ln r) −1 ln ln R [6], p. 93, and the indicator has the form HF0 (θ) = - π ρ n∑ k = 1 ∆k sin ρ (θ - ϑk), 0 6 θ 6 2π. Therefore, the HF0 (θ) indicator satisfies the inequality (12) and, according to the above function φ0 (z) from the formula (13), will be limited solutions to the problem (1). 4) Let the inequality (12). We build the function φ0 (z) = p∏ s = 1 exp {z 2πi ∫ l j + s (ln g (τ) - 2πins (τ)) dτ τ (τ - z)} ≡ p∏ S = 0 φs (z ) where the zer zer is considered to be a function
