-Tigoricity of the Boolery algebra, the work is devoted to the study of the auto resistance of the calculia of the maced algebra regarding various classes. In [3], McCo proved that under a certain effect of the concept of DG-cathegicity and relative dg-cathegicity for the Boolean algebra, coincide. In this work, it is shown that the result of McCoy can be generalized, from seemingly an effective condition. With the help of the technique of trees, the following lemma has been proven.
