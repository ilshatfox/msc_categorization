By zero integrals on hyperbolic rectangles, let D = {z e s: lzl <1} - hyperbolic plane INI2. The decomposition of the Ivasawa Group G of conformal autorphisms of the circle D has the form G = K A An, where k = s0 (2), a = {a 1 = (~~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~ ~): t e}, 1 + is is 198 -sis )} 1 - is: s e IR. Consider the following task type Pompey. We call the multiple of the type q = {z = n, at · o: o $ s $ a, $ t $ 1} with a hyperbolic rectangle. Let the function F E C (D) and R DXDY} 9 Q F (Z) (L _ LZL2) 2 = O, VG e n A. should F = O B D? In the general case, the response from the ritative, however, with some additional suggestions on F, it can be argued that F = O (see theorem below). In this work, a generalization of this task was obtained in case of not any functions. For E N, designate qk = {z = p, a1 · o: О $ s $ CL'K, O $ t $ 1} (1 $ k $ t) and lm (z) = 'l: ~ 1 fk (z ).
