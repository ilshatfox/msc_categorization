UDC 517.955 On the resolving of the initial task for the differential equation with private derivatives of V.S. Mokechev1, A.M. Sidorov2 1 valery.mokeychev@kpfu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University 2 anatoly.sidorov@kpfu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University in the space ivil distributions with values ​​in the banach space considers the initial task for the differential equation with private derivatives. Keywords: differential equation with private derivatives, the space ivil distributions, lus -solution. In [1], [2], the concept of ffic distribution was determined and studied, which turned out to be a convenient means of finding decisions of some differential equations with private derivatives. In order to expand the class of equations, to which the approach based on this concept is applicable in [3], [4] was introduced ivil distribution, where B was banakh space. In this work, we, in the framework of the ising space of distributions, continue the study of the initial task for the differential equation with private derivatives. Let φ - the final set of multicindexs α = (α1,., Αn), cα, j (t), j = 0 ,. . . , M, - linear operators, with each t ∈ [a, b) ⊂ r displaying some banakh space b in themselves, ω is the area in rn, x = (x1,., Xn) purpose, d jt = ∂ ∂ ∂ j ∂t j, dk = ∂∂xk, k = 1 ,. . . , n; D α x = dα11. . .D αn n. The resolution of the equation is studied m∑ j = 0 ∑ αion Cα, J (t) d j t d α x u = f (t, x), t ∈ [a, b), x ∈ω. (1) The desired function u = u (t, x) must satisfy the conditions d j t u | t = a = g j (x), j = 0 ,. . . , M −1. (2) The solution of the problem (1), (2) is searched in the space d ′ ′ (b) [4] φb -distributions with values ​​in the banach space b, where wor = {exp ((µ + i p) x), p purpose Z n}, µ = (µ1,., Μn) ∈ C n. Since u (t, x) and f (t, x) -∗ distribution, then for almost all T V.S. Mokechev, A.M. Sidorov 241 u (t, x) = ∑ p up (t) exp ((µ+ i p) x), (3) f (t, x) = ∑ p fp (t) exp ((µ+ i p) x) (4) decompositions in a row Fourier [4] according to the system φ φb -distribution u (t, x), f (t, x). Determination 1. Function V (t): [a, b) → b is called absolutely continuous if there is a function w (t): [a, b) → b is such that ∥w (t) ∥b ∈ L1LOC ([A , b)) and v (t) = ∫ t a w (s) d s, ∥ · ∥b - the norm in space b. Determination 2. ivil distribution of U is called the fficue of the problem (1), (2), if UP (t) is absolutely continuous, equality (2) and equality (1) are made in D ′ ′ (2). We set the operators qp, j (t): b → b, t ∈ [a, b), the formula Qp, J (t) = ∑ αλ (µ+ i p) αcα, j (t), p ∈ Z n, j = 0 ,. . . , M. Theorem. Let with some µ operators qp, m (t) with all p ∈ Z N have reverse, ∥ (qp, m (t)) - 1qp, j (t) ∥b ≤ c (t), where c (t) ∈ L1loc ([a, b)) and ∥ (qp, m (t)) - 1 fp (t) ∥b ∈ L1 loc ([a, b)). Then the task (1), (2) is unambiguously resolved in space d ′ ′ (b). Comment. Ifu (t, x) - the solution of the equation (1), almost everywhere in T, belonging to the space of Sobolev 2, φ (ω), the same equality (3), (4), (4). Therefore, ifu (t, x) is such a solution, then it is a ∗ a solution. An example given in [3] shows that the reverse statement is incorrect. Literature 1. Mokechev V.S., Mokechev A.V.
