The algorithm for solving the problem of identifying the permeability of the household filter D.A. Panin1 1 dany.panin99@gmail.com; Kazan (Volga) Federal University has developed an algorithmic for the reverse task of determining the effective permeability of the filler of the household filter for water purification. The task is to identify the magnitude of permeability, which is included as the parameter in the formulation of a direct task of the filtration process. A direct task is formulated as part of a mathematical model of one -dimensional single -phase filtration in the gravity field with dynamic boundary conditions for pressure. The model describes the two stages of the process: a) filtering with free water from the filter; b) filtering with the gradual flooding of the output cross section of the filter in the reservoir-receiver. The reverse problem is solved by minimizing the functionality of deviations of model and measured dynamics of reducing the free surface of the water in the source tank. The coordination of decisions obtained during the first stage and during the period of both stages of the process with an additional unknown parameter - the moment of the beginning of the second stage. A simplified algorithm for two measurements of the water surface is proposed and an assessment of its reliability was made. The reliability of the solution was evaluated by laboratory measurements of the permeability of the filter. Key words: single -phase filtration, absolute permeability, experiment, reverse task, filter Introduction Household filters of water purification are characterized by almost ubiquitous use. They are extremely easy to operate, and the only task of servicing them is to replace the filter element - the cartridge. Filters manufacturers indicate the resource of the cartridge, measured in the total volume of purified water. Since this value in practice is almost impossible to evaluate, it is recommended that some averaged temporary interval for the replacement of cartridges, which, however, can vary significantly depending on the intensity of using the filter or the degree of pollution of the purified water. As an objective alternative indicator, the degree of decrease in the permeability of the filter element, which requires a simple method of measuring permeability available to each user, can be used. This work provides the results of assessing the applicability of such an algorithm. The setting of the problem of the filter scheme is indicated in Fig. 1. The area of ​​solving the direct problem of water filtration is the area of ​​the filter cartridge. The level of water in the reservoirist and the reservoir -receiver (when flooding the output section of the filter) 144 “Lobachev readings - 2019” determine the boundary values ​​of the pressure in the liquid. Rice. 1. The process diagram is the process of the process we consider one -dimensional along the vertical axis Y, the filter is homogeneous with effective permeability K, we consider the saturation of the filter with water complete, and the course is completely neglected by the course. Taking into account the law of filtering darsie in the gravity field [1], we write the Equivalent Equity: Divu = Div (−k µ [∂p ∂y +ρg]) = 0 or ∂ 2P ∂Y2 = 0, (1) where U is the filtration rate liquids (m/s), µ - the dynamic viscosity coefficient of the filtering liquid (P), P -pressure (PA), ρ is the density of the liquid (kg/m2), G - acceleration of free drop (M/s2). The solution of equation (1) gives a linear distribution of pressure in the filter, determined by the boundary conditions P (y = 0) = p0 and p (y = l) = PL. The boundary pressure values ​​are equal to hydrostatic pressure on the lower and upper boundaries of the filter, determined by the values ​​of the height of the free surface: p (y) = p0 + y (pl --p0)/ l, p0 = ρg h1 (t), pl = ρg h (t) . The solution of the direct problem of the filtering process can consist of two stages: a) the free expiration of the water from the lower section of the filter (0 ≤ t ≤ t: h1 (t) = 0) (the corresponding decision will be denoted by the lower index (1)) and b) the flooding of the lower The filter sections (t> t: h1 (t)> 0) (the corresponding decision will be denoted by the lower index (2)). To calculate the filtration rate, we write down the pressure derivative of y: 0 ≤ t ≤ t: ∂p ∂y = ρg h (t) l; t> t: ∂p ∂y = ρg h (t) −h1 (t) l. Substituting these values ​​in the Darsi law, given that u = f1f2 h and h (t)+ h1 (t) (t) m = h̃ = const, we get two ordinary differential equations from the function h (t) ḣ (1) = - k µ F2 F1 (h (1) l +1) ρg, ḣ (2) = - k µ f2 ((m +1) h (2) −Mh̃ l +1) ρg, D.A. Panin 145 where F1, F2 is the cross -sectional area of ​​the vessel -receiver and filter, M = F1F1+F2. We introduce dimensionless variables by normalizing the characteristic scenes of the headquarters: h̄ = h l, ū = u u0, t̄ = t0, k̄ = k k0, t0 = f1l f2u0, u0 = k0 µ ρg, ¯̃h = h̃ l, where K0 = where k0 = 10-10 m2 - characteristic permeability. Then the latest equations will accept the form ḣ (1) = −k (h (1) +1), ḣ (2) = −k (h (2) (1 +m) −Mh̃ +1). Rice. 2. a) the dependence of the function h (t, k, h) a) on k: 1) k = 0.2, 2) k = 0.3, 3) k = 0.5; b) from t: 1) t = 0.5 c, 2) t = 3 c. We will present their solutions in the form of a generalized function h (t, k, t) (Fig. 2): h
