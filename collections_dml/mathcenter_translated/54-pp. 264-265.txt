Materials of the International School-Conference UDC 517.955 correctly solved tasks for linear differential equations in private derivatives V.S. Mokechev1, A.M. Sidorov2 1 valery.mokeychev@kpfu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University 2 anatoly.sidorov@kpfu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University using the theory of ffic distribution, we consider the task of koshi for a linear differential equation in private derivatives. Keywords: linear differential equation in private derivatives, the task of the Cossack, uction is distribution. Consider the differential equation p (t, u, d) u = dnt u + m∑ j = 1 ∑ αion cα, j (t) d j t d α x u = f (t, x), (1) where t ∈ R, x ∈ Rn, D Y - a symbol of differentiation by y, φ - a final set of multi -fosels, Cα, J (t) - a square matrix that does not depend on x and u, f (t, x) - a well -known function. No dependent on u. If (1) describes the mathematical model of the dynamic process, then the solution must satisfy the initial and regional conditions. In this case, the resulting task should be correctly set according to Adamaru [1]. Let f (t, x) = φ∑ | k | = 0 fk (t) exp (i kx t), (2) where k = (k1,., KN) - vector with integer coordinates, fk (t ) - a well -known function that does not depend on X and belonging to some banach space b, i kxt = i k1x1 + · · · + i kn xntn, t j> 0, x = (x1,., Xn) ∈ R n n. , I - an imaginary unit. In [2], [3], the concept of 8 distributions was introduced, i.e. E. 8 -distribution with values ​​in a given banach space b. These distributions turned out to be very convenient, including when solving problems for linear differential equations in private derivatives. It was shown that the space of ∗ distribution is the widest space in which equality is true (2). The solution U equation (1) is searched in the space of ∗ distribution, i.e., u = ger∑ | k | = 0 uk (t) exp (i kx t). (3) If UK (t) ∈C nl OC (R), then u (m) t = ∑icle | k | = 0 u (m) k (t) exp (i kx t), m = 0 ,. . . , N. The decision U must satisfy the conditions of the cat u (m) t (0, x) = GM (x), m = 0 ,. . . , N −1, (4) R.G. Nasibullin 265 in which GM (x) -known ffic -distribution, i.e., GM (x) = و | k | = 0 gm, k exp (i kx t), gm, k ∈ Cn. Definition. ∗b - distribution U (3) is called the solution of the problem (1), (4) if ger∑ | k | = 0 p (t, x, d) (uk (t) exp (i kx t)) = f (t (t) , x) and the conditions are fulfilled (4). Theorem. IfCα, j (t) ∈ L1LOC (R), then the task (1), (4) correctly solved the Poadamaru in the space of ising distributions. Literature 1. Hadamard J.
