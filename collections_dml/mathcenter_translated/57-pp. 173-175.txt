Lobachevsky 2 Dianalynx@rambler.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.I. Lobachevsky 3 samy@iitm.ac.in; The Indian Technological Institute of Madras, the Mathematics Department received an analogue of the Boror theorem for the Cesaro operator, operating in the space of functions, holomorphic and limited in a single circle. The asymptotic behavior of an analogue of the boron amount for this operator was also studied. Key words: Boron inequality, Operator Cesaro. Let d = {z ∈C: | z | <1} - a single circle, b is a class of all functions, holomorphic in D, such as | f (z) | ≤ 1 in D. The Borean theorem in its final form [1] reads: theorem. If f ∈ B, f (z) = φ∑ n = 0 an z n and m f (r) = φ∑ n = 0 | r n, then m f (r) ≤ 1 for r ≤ 1/3 and constant 1/3 cannot be improved. In a more general case, you can consider the value M (r) = sup m f (r) ∥ f ∥ et, where the Supremum is taken according to all limited and analytical in D functions F ̸≡ 0. There are many works that study the value M (R). So, bombing [2] Doca hall that m (r) = 3- √ 8 (1 - r 2) r for 1/3 ≤ r ≤ 1/ p 2. The simplest assessment for M (r), true for anyone r, follows from the inequality of Koshi-Bunakovsky: m f (r) ≤ (φ∑ k = 0 | ak | 2) 1/2 (φ∑ k = 0 r 2k) 1/2 ≤ ∥ f " 2. In 2004, Bombieri and Burgeine [3] managed to show that this inequality is strict, that is, that m (r) <1p 1 --r 2 for R> 1/ P 2. 174 Materials of the School-Conference in the same work was The asymptotic behavior of m (r) at R → 1. It turned out that for any ε> 0 there is a constant C (ε), such that m (r) ≥ (1 - R 2) −1/2 - (C log 1 1 - r) 3/2+ε R → 1. A large number of results associated with the inequality of the boron in various productions can be found in the works [4–7]. In the presented article, an analogue of the inequality of Bor for the Operator Cesaro ([8], [9]) was obtained, which for the function f (z) = ∑icle = 0 an zn, the holomorphic BD, can be determined as follows: C F (Z) : = Φ∑ n = 0 (1 n +1 n∑ k = 0 ak) zn = ∫ 1 0 f (t z) 1 - t z d t. The sum of the boron for the operator Cesaro takes the form C M F (R): = ger∑ n = 0 (1 n +1 n∑ k = 0 | ak |) r n. It should be noted that for all R ∈ [0.1) the following inequality is true: | C F (Z) | ≤ 1 R Log 1 1 - R. Then the natural analogue of the Boror theorem for the Cesaro operator is the following theorem 1. Let f (z) = ger∑ n = 0 an z n ∈B. Then C M F (R) ≤ 1 R Log 1 1 - R for R ≤ R, where r = 0.5335 ... is a positive root root 2x = 3 (1– x) log 11–x. The number R cannot be improved. Also, an interesting task is the study of asymptotic behavior C M F (R) for R → 1. The following result was obtained: theorem 2. Let f (z) = ger∑ n = 0 an z n ∈ B. Then for r ∈ [0.1) is performed The inequality c m f (r) ≤ 1 r √ 1+ r 1 - r log (1+ r)+ log (1 - r). The resulting assessment is correct for all R ∈ [0.1). For R, close to one, we have C M F (R) ≤ √ 2log2 P 1 - R ≈ 1.17741P 1 - R. I.r. Kayumov, D.M. Khammatova, S.
