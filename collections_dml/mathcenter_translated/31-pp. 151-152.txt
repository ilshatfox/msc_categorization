. The presentation of the algebra von Neumann, induced by a tightly defined operator M. R. Timirshin Kazan State University, timirshinm@yandex.ru algebra von Neumann in the Hilbert space K is the involutionary subhalhgebra of the algebra of all limited linear operators in K, closed in weak operator topology (see , for example, [3]). Various representations of the Algebr von 151 Neumanans are one of the most important tools in the study of such algebra. In this paper, a representation is built related to a closed tightly given operator. Theorem. Let K, L - Hilbert Space, M - Algebra von Neumann, acting in K, T - a closed tightly specified operator acting from K to l, h ≡ l⊕k. Then the display ψt: m - → b (h) acting according to the rule ψt (a) ≡ (α (tα ∗) ∗ tα t (tα ∗) (a ∈M), where α ∆ ∆1/2t a∆ 1/2 t, ∆t ≡ (1 + t ∗ t) −1, is carried out by an isomer physical algebra von Neumann M and ψt (m). In particular, when m = b (k), then ψt is isomorphism algebr von Neumann b (k) and p) b (t (h) pγ (t), where pγ (t) is an orthprojector to the Operator's schedule γ (t) T. Definition. In conditions of steam theorems (ψt, h) it is called the representation of the algebra von Neumanm M, associated with the operator t. The above theorem is a generalization of the design set forth in the sentence 16 of the work [1]. It is also associated with the design of the algebra von Neumann, as evidenced by the next result. The proposal. Let the algebra von Neumann, acting in the Hilbert space K, t - a closed tightly set operator in K, annexed to m ′, h ≡ k ⊕k. Then the representations of the algebrus von Neumann m (ψt, h) and (ρt, h) coincide, where the display ρt: m - → b (h) is determined by the formula ρt (a) ≡ pγ (t) (a 0 0 a) pγ (t ) (a ∈M). 152
