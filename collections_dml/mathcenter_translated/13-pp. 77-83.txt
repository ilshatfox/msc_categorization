Parallel implementation of iterative algorithms for variational inequalities with M-matrix D.O. Solovyov Kazan State University considers the class of grid variation inequalities, which can be recorded in the form of the next system of equations (inclusions) in RN AU + Bγ + Δ = F; γ ∈ Cu, Δ ∈ Du, (1) where a, B is M -brutal, (2) C, D are the diagonal maximum monotonous operators of the WRN. (3) Suppose that submission (u, γ, δ), γ ∈ Cu, Δ ∈ Du and superfillation (U, γ, δ), γ ∈ Cu, Δ ∈ DU of the task (1.1): (U, γ) exist , δ) ¿(u, γ, δ), au + bγ + δ ¿f ¿au + bγ + δ, (4) where u à 0 means component inequality. Then the following theorems of the existence of the solution (theorem 1) and comparison (theorem 2) ([1] - [3]) are true. Theorem 1. When fulfilling conditions (2) - (4), equation (1) has a solution (u, γ, δ) for any f ∈ Rn. Theorem 2. Suppose that assumptions (2) (4) and a, b have a weak diagonal predominance by columns. (5) and also takes place one of the following conditions: (A) A or B have a strictly diagonal predominance by columns; or 77 parallel implementation of iterative algorithms. . . (b) C either continuously monotonous or strictly as monotonous operator; or (c) ∃α> 0: a -αb -m -M -a m -a weak diagonal predominance for columns. If (U1, γ1, Δ1) and (U2, γ2, Δ2) are solutions (1) with the right parts F1 and F2, Note 1. From the theorem of comparison 2, the unity of the solution follows (u, γ, δ) ∈ 〈(u, γ, δ), (u, γ, δ)〉 for the task (1.1). Let for l = 1, 2 ,. . . , p a = al0 - al1, b = BL0 - BL1 are the splitting of matrices A, B, such that Al0, B L 0 are M Matrix, AL1 à 0, BL1 à 0. Next, we also assume that Al0 à A0 BL0 à B0, where A0, B0 are diagonal parts A and B. Let El à 0 is also a diagonal matrix and ∑p l = 1el = ID, where a single matrix is ​​indicated through the ID. Consider the following iterative method for solving the problem (1): al0v k+1 l+b l 0η k+1 l+δ k+1 l = a l 1u k+bl1γ k+f, ηk+1l ∈ CV K+1 l , Δ k+1 l ∈ DV K+1 L l = 1, 2 ,. . . , p; uk+1 = p∑ l = 1 elv k+1 l; γ k+1 = p∑ l = 1 el op+1 l; Δ k+1 = p∑ l = 1 elδ k+1 l (6) for k = 0, 1, 2 ,. . . with initial approximation (U0, γ0). Theorem 3. Let the conditions of theorem 2 (comparison) for the task (1) and for the case (c) theorem 2. Let also split matrices A and B are consistent in the following sense: ∀L ∃αL> 0: al0 - αlbl0 are poorly diagonal Branding along columns M -matrixes. Then the iterative method (6) converges for any boss approaching (u0, γ0) from the ordered interval 〈(u, γ), (u, γ)〉 and, if (u0, γ0) = (u, γ) ((u0 , γ0) = (u, γ)), the sequence {(uk, γk, δk)} converges, monotonously decreasing (age), to the only solution (u ∗, γ ∗, δ ∗) of the problem (1). 78 D.O. Soloviev will now consider the iterative method such as block relaxation with variable blocks (this, in particular, is the multiplier method of the Schwartz for grid variation inequalities, recorded in the form of the equation (1)). For simplicity, we analyze the case when the iteration method is built on the use of only two splitting of matrices A and B. Let the matrices and vectors be divided into non -overturning blocks: a = (aij) 3 i, j = 1, b = (bij) 3 i, j = 1, C = Diag (C1, C2, C3), ID = (ID1, ID2, ID3), U = (U1, U2, U3), F = (F1, F2, F3). Determine A10 =   A11 A12 0 A22 0 0 0 A33  , B10 =   B11 B12 0 B21 B22 0 0 B33  , A20 =   A11 0 0 0 A22 A23 0 A32 A33 , B20 , B20 =   b11 0 0 0 B22 B23 0 B32 B33  , as well as the diagonal matrices E1 = Diag (ID1, ID2, 0), E2 = Diag (0, ID2, ID3). Let A = AL0 - AL1, B = BL0 - BL1 for l = 1, 2 are two splitting of matrices A, b. Obviously, AL0, B L 0 are M Matrixes and AL1 à 0, BL1 à 0. Consider the following iterative method: A10ṽ K +1 +B10 η̃ K +1 +σ̃K +1 = A11U K +B11γ K +F; η̃k+1 ∈ Cṽk+1, σ̃k+1 ∈ Dṽk+1; (7) (VK+1, ηk+1, σk+1) T = E1 (ṽ k+1, η̃k+1, σ̃k+1) t++(id - e1) (uk, γk, Δk) t; (8) A20ũ K+1+B20 γ̃ K+1+δ̃K+1 = A21V K+1+B21QUA K+1+F; γ̃k+1 ∈ Cũk+1, Δ̃k+1 ∈ Dũk+1; (9) 79 Parallel implementation of iterative algorithms. . . (UK+1, γK+1, ΔK+1) ​​T = E2 (ũ K+1, γ̃K+1, Δ̃K+1) T++(ID - E2) (VK+1, ηK+1, σk+1) t (10) with initial approximation (u0, γ0). Theorem 4. Let the conditions of theorem 2. Then the Iteration method (7) - (10) converges for any initial approximation (U0, γ0) from the ordered interval 〈(u, γ), (u, γ)〉 and, if (u0 γ0) = (u, γ) ((u0, γ0) = (u, γ)), then the sequence {(uk, γk, Δk)} converges, monotonously decreasing (age), to the only solution (u ∗, γ ∗, Δ ∗) Tasks (1). Note 2. Comparison 2 theorem allows you to prove that the iterative method (7) - (10) converges no slower than the method (6), when the initial approximation is a sub- or superfluousness of the task (1). As an illustration of general theoretical results, we consider the system of variational inequalities, which
