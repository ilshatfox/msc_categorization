) The conditions of one -leafness of solving the external reverse edge problem according to the decartre parameters in this work are generalized the results of the article [1] in the event of two decent coordinates X, Y. It is required to find a closed jordan circuit lz = l1z ∪ l2z in the plane of the integrated alternate z = x + iy and the function W (Z), analytical in the DZ area, nder ∈ DZ and ∂DZ = LZ. The boundary values ​​of W (t), t ∈ LZ are set in the form of W = lus (x) + iψ1 (x), 0 ≤ x ≤ a, on one part L1z, W = ∗2 (x) + iψ2 (x), 0 ≤ x ≤ a, on the rest of the part l1z, w = onic (y) + iψ (y), −b ≤ y ≤ b, on l2z. It is assumed that these values ​​in the plane W are determined by the closed Zhordan circuit LW. We believe that o ∈ L1z and W0 = W (∞) in the plane W is fixed in advance (setting M. T. Numan). The solution and formula method for the Z (ζ) function depending on the arbitrary C = A + IB constant and displaying E on DZ is the same as in [2]. We denote through W = ω (ζ) the conformal display of the circle E = {| ζ | <1} on DW is such that ω (0) = w0 and ω (eiγa) = onic (−b) + iψ (−b), 0 <γa <π. The prototypes of points ∗ (b) + iψ (b) and С) (0) + iψ2 (0) are denoted through eiγb and eiγc, respectively, and γb = 2π - γa, γa <γc <γb. The one -leafness of the desired region is guaranteed by the following conditions: 1) part L1z corresponding to the arc {eiγ | γc <γ <γb} of a single circle should lie strictly above the part L1z corresponding to the arc of the same circumference {eiγ | γa <γ <γb}; 2) the arc L2z should lie in the half -plate of re Z> a. These sufficient conditions determine in the plane A + IB two areas, which will have a non -empty intersection G while fulfilling the conditions of 3γA + γc> 2π, γc - γa <π. If the point A + Ib ∈ G, then the Z (ζ) function and the desired area DZ will be single -leaf. 5 L and T R A T RALIMOT R. B.
