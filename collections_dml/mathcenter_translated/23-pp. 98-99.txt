) A sign of the instability of the extreme surface from RN in the report presented a sign of the instability of the surface M ⊂ Rn, which is obtained using the C-capacity of the capacitor and assessment of the second variation of the area type of area: f (m) = ∫ m φ (₽) DM, (1) where hole - a single normal to the surface m, φ: rn → R - non -negative, c2 - cordy function. To formulate the main results, we need to enter the designations: g = d2φ + δij (φ - <∇φ, ă>), where ∇φ = (∂φ ∂acy1,., ∂φ ∂ident); || A || 2G = n∑ i = 1 g (A (ei), a (ei)) + || a || 2 (φ - <∇φ, ₽>) and some concepts: 1) let m - Rimanovo diversity with a piece of curly-hot edge or without it. Consider the two closed unrestrained subset P and Q. The value of CAPG (p, q) = Inf ∫ m g | ∇ices | 2, where the exact lower line is taken along all locally lipsit functions ising: m → R, such that lus (m ) = 1, if m ∈ P, and onic (m) = 0, if m ∈ Q is called the G - the capacitor (p, q) (see, for example, [1]). 2) The variety of M is called G - Parabolic (see [2]), if there is an exhaustion of M open by many dk, k = 1, 2,. . .; D1 b d2 b. . .; ⋃ K≥1 dk = m, such that for any compact k ⊂ m, Lim Inf K →+ger Capg (K, DK \ DK - 1) = 0. 3) The extreme surface is called stable if its second variation is familiar. 100 theorem 1. Let m - extreme functionality (1), such that: the matrix G is a positively defined and exists compact P B M, such that ∫ p || a || 2g> capg (p, ∂m). Then the surface m is unstable. Theorem 2. Let M steable extremal functionality (1) has a G - paradara type and matrix G is positively determined, then the surface M is a plane. L and Tr. T R A 1. Goldstein V.M., Reshetnyak Yu. G.

Salahudinov (Kazan, rsalahudinov@ksu.ru) classic isoperimetric inequalities and isperimetric monotony of the functionals for the first time a hypothesis about the existence of isperimetric monotony of the functionals was expressed by J. Hersh [1]. This approach allows, introducing an additional parameter, continuously tie various physical and geometric characteristics of the region, such as the main frequency of oscillations, worshiping, area, maximum conformal radius and other values. As a special case, the property of isperimetric monotony contains a number of classical inequalities, therefore, summarizes them. For the first time, this property was proven by M. Kekhler -Jobin [2], in particular, the Polya -Sega hypothesis was proved about isperimetric inequality between the main frequency of oscillation and the rigidity of the twisting and the well -known inequality of the Faber - the crane was generalized. This paper discusses new geometric functionals of the region and classical physical functionality, in 101
