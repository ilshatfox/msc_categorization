Rough rides in the dynamics of flexible plates when exposed to longitudinal periodic loads Krysko A.V., Mitskevich S.A. The Saratov State Technical University built the theory of rude attractors in the dynamics of flexible plates. As the original equations, the equations of Margerra-Vlasov Mushtari are taken. The solution method: the final differences in spatial to the ordinates, the methods of the Gauss for the system of linear algebraic equations and the Runge-kugg for the system of ordinary differential equations according to the variable t. Methods of the theory of stochastic vibrations are used. In the area of ​​the control parameters of the RX (Yu), where RX is the intensity of the longitudinal dynamic load along the Ox axis. Yu is its frequency, areas of rude attractions are built, in which three countries are identified, which are localized in various areas of phase space without intersection. These attrays are rude, as they retain their structure and static properties with small of the menenia of the control parameters of the Px and Yu. To analyze the stochastic fluctuations of flexible plates, the following characteristics were built: 1V (X, Y, T), F (X, Y, T), W (X, Y, T), Phase Portra You Li • (and '), Poincare of Functions W, F, MP = (MX + MU) 12, N P = (N, + N,.) / 2 for arbitrary points of the plate plan, power spectra, auto -correlation functions. A characteristic type of display of Poincare for W, F, MP = (MX +MU)/2 at F> X = 9 and A> = 16; Px = O, 5 and Y = 17 shown in Fig. l (b-g, e-Z), the dependence of the deflection-time (W (0.5; 0.5; 1)) is shown in Fig. Ja and LD. These characteristics are identical to all points of the plate plan.
