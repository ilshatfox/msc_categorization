The functions G (T, L) and G′L (T, L) satisfy the conditions of karateodori, that is, measurable by T for any l ∈ R and continuous in L for almost every t ∈ π, limited on any limited set. Permissible control of U (·) from class D absolutely continuous to [0, T1] functions such as U 6 U (T1) 6 U, | U ′ (T1) | 6 û. Let ω are a lot of those departments, each of which is met by the only global, generalized solution of the XU (·) problem (1), (2). Let π ≡ {t2 ∈ R: UT1 6 T2 6 T2 - UT1} - the upper part of the border π, A (·) - a given function from L2 ([π]). Consider the task of optimal control f [u] ≡ ‖xu (t1, ·) - a (·) ‖l2 [π] → min, u ∈ ω.

Sufficient conditions for the stability of the existence of the global solution to the XU problem (1), (2) from [1], [2]. The work was done under the guidance of prof. V.I.

Panagushina Kazan State University, dmitri.berzhnoi@ksu.ru Study of the stress-deformed and marginal state of the soil interacting with the concrete plate partially located in it presented the methodology and results of the calculation A concrete slab partially located in the ground, taking into account their joint deformation and the possibility of achieving the maximum state. The calculated plate and the adjacent soil can be represented as a three -dimensional array, which has specific properties. It is known that soils are physically non -linear environments and obey the law of Hook in a small range of exerted loads. There are numerous mathematical models that allow us to describe the deformation process, which differ in the complexity of the resolving equations. This work uses a model similar to a model of an ideal-plastic body. In accordance with it, it is assumed that the law of Hook is fair to the limiting state, and after its achievement, the medium begins to deform without increasing the UP 22
