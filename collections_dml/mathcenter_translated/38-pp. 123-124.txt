The use of the estimates of the area during the localization of the maximum of the conformal radius based on the approach approach [1], [2] the conditions of the unity of the critical point of the conformal radius of the flat area were obtained. These conditions have the form of subordination of the considered functionals of some majority. Evidence is based on the application of the results of solutions of extreme problems for areas for conformity display of a single circle. Let S - the class of functions G (Z) = Z + C2z2 + C3 Z3 + · · · ·, regular and single -leaf in the circle E = {Z: lz/ <1}; S0 124 T. century. Zharkova, n. AND .
