. A numerical study of the task of an emergency task on the influx of a gas condensate mixture to an imperfect opening of the well M.T. Abasov, G.I. Dzhalalov, T.M. Ibrarimov, A.M. Mamedov, H.A. Faizullaev Institute of problems of deep oil and gas deposits of Azerbaijani , 370143, Baku, 33 Gjavid Ave., studying the impact of imperfection according to the degree of autopsy and determining the coefficients of the imperfection of wells, is accurately dedicated to oil and gas wells. Hydogasodynamic studies associated with the development of gas of condensate deposits, taking into account the multidimensionality of the flow and nonsense of the well, are one of the complex and poorly studied areas of theory and practice. This work is devoted to a numerical study on the basis of the binary model of the task of the gas condensate inflow. The mixture to the well -which -which is different in the degree of autopsy. At the same time, the calculation of the scheme and the algorithm has been developed, a program was compiled and implemented that allowed the calculation poem to explore the process of the inflow of the gas condensate mixture on the gas regime to the well imperfect opening, and the effect of the location of the opening of the layer and the degree of imperfect on the distribution of capacitance and pressure. At the same time, a picture of the distribution of capacitance in the bottomhole zone of the well was first built, which can affect the correct selection of measures to increase the efficiency of the operation of wells. 262
