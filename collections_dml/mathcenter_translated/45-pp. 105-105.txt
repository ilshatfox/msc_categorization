Dispersions of hydroacoustic waves in the operation of the NOK. It is enough that observant in the experiments of Dyscard Pers11n flat acoustic waves in water can be described with the nomads of the mathematical model of the hereditary U111 RURE OF NOUNTING and Thomson. Formulas for the ramparts were obtained: I am the phenomena of the1yological coefficients of the model of the model through the speed of the moist -frequency and ultrouvular waves and the cities: 3 decrees Ment :: ~ Atuhniy Ultra :: ~ vuk.: T. The system of equations of the hydroaccourse of the CI, taking into account the dispersion of the waves, is given to the symmetrical T -gyperbot ~ thah form. M. M.
