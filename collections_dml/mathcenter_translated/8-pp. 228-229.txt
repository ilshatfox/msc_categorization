) Maximization of some determinants found in the theory of experiment planning in mathematical statistics, it is necessary to maximize the determinants of matrices of the type ∥∥∥∥∥ n∑ k = 0 fi (xk) fj (xk) ∥∥∥∥∥ n i, j = 0, where x0 , x1 ,. . . , XN belong E = (a, b) or [a, b], and the functions of FI (x) are continuous on E. We represent the solution to this problem when fi (x) = √ ω (x) XI, x ∈ (A , b) for some special cases of choice ω (x). Let the polynomial a (x) degree q + 1, positive on (a, b) polynomial b (x) degree not higher than p + 2 and function h (x) satisfy conditions 1) h ′ (x) h (x) = a (x) b (x), 2) lim x → a+0 ω (x) x2n = lim x → b --0 x2n = 0, ω (x) = bs+1 (x) h (x). Theorem. If h (x), a (x), b (x) satisfy conditions 1) and 2), then x0, x1 ,. . . , xn from (a, b), which maximize the determinant Det ∥∥∥H (XI) BS+1 (XI) XI+Ji ∥∥∥ n i, j = 0, are zeros of the polynomial f (x) degree n+1, satisfying the differential equation b (x) y ′ ′ + (a (x) + (s + 1) b ′ (x)) y ′ = γns (x) y, (1) where γns (x) is the polynomial degrees R = max {p, q}. In the case when h (x) is a classic weight function, equation (1) coincides with the differential equation of the S -derivatives of classic orthogonal polynomials of the degree n + s. 228 also considered cases corresponding to functions a) h (x) = xα (1 + x/t) –β, x ∈ (0, + urb); b) h (x) = (1 + x2/t) −β, x ∈ (− least, + urb), under some conditions for parameters; And in these cases, the equations obtained from (1) coincide with the corresponding equations for orthogonal polynomials.

Khaliullin (Kazan) Contiguality and equal continuity of the sequences of probabilistic measures, the concept of the contrast of sequences of probabilistic measures was introduced in mathematical statistics for the task of distinguishing close hypotheses. It is a natural generalization of the concept of absolute continuity of probabilistic measures. An important role in the theory of measures is played by the concept of continuity in the direction, which naturally coordinates the linear structure of space and measure. The work considers a generalization of this concept on the sequence of probabilistic measures. Let E-linear space, E-some σ-algebra of subset E, invariant relative to shifts on elements h ∈ E. Determination 1 [1]. The probabilistic measure µ in the space (E, E) is called continuous in the direction of the vector h ∈ E if the condition limt → 0 µ (a - th) = µ (A) is completed for each A ∈ E. Determination 2. Let EN-linear space, EN-some σ-algebra of its subsets, and the operation was shifted 229
