The versions of “almost probably” maximum theorems for random placements with a random number of particles, let it have n cells, in which n particles are randomly thrown from each other. The probability of getting each fixed particle into a cell with a number J is 1/n for any j = 1, n. Let µ0 (n, n) - the number of empty cells. Consider the independent random values ​​mit, perf, n ∈ N, evenly distributed on the segment [0, 1]. Let N, N ∈ N, ∆I = ∆NI = [I -1 N, I N), 1 6 I 6 N. The implementation of the random veh of the lection lection is considered as random placement n particles by n cells. The number of empty cells, in this sense, can be represented in the form of µ0 (n, n) = n∑ i = 1 n∏ j = 1 i {ăjiment}. 174 denote α = n/n. We assume that the area of ​​change N, N → φ is central, that is, 0 <α1 6 N/N 6 α2 <imes, where α1 and α2 are constants. We complicate the probabilistic scheme, assuming that the number of particles is an integer random value ν with an average an and dispersion Nσ2. We assume that at first, according to some pre -set distribution law p {ν = n}, the implementation of the value ν = n is determined, and then, subject to ν = n, the equivalent scheme for placement n particles in n cells is considered. In this case, the number of empty cells is µ0 (ν, n) = n∑ i = 1 φ∑ k = 0 k∏ j = 1 i {ăjion} i {ν = k}. Consider νn, n ∈ N, - the sequence of independent integer random values ​​determined in the probabilistic space (ω, a, p). Denote san = µ0 (νn, n) - eµ0 (νn, n) √ dµ0 (νn, n). Let γ is a standard normal random value, δx is a measure of a single mass concentrated at point X, µζ - the distribution of a random value ζ. The convergence of the distribution of random values ​​and the weak convergence of the measures is denoted by the symbols D - → and W - →, respectively. Theorem 1. Let the families {ă} and {νn} are independent, νn --an σ √ n d - → γ with n → ¾ and q (0) n (ω) = 1 log n n∑ k = 1 k ΔSν n ( ω). Then q (0) n (ω) w - → µγ for n → φ for almost all ω ∈ ω. 175 Theorem 1 is a version of “almost probably” a normal maximum theorem ([1], p. 178). Let 0 <β <1 and [x] - a whole part X. The particle falls into the first N ′ = = βn] cells with the probability p = n ′/n, and in the last n - [βn] - with the probability of Q = 1–N ′/n. In this scheme, the number of empty cells among the first n ′ cells is µ0 (ν, n ′) = n ′ ∑ i = 1 φ∑ k = 0 k∏ j = 1 i {ăjion ∆i} i {ν = k} . Consider Saven ′ = µ0 (ν, n ′) - eµ0 (ν, n ′) √ dµ0 (ν, n ′). Theorem 2. Let 0 <α1 <α2 <° and qn (ω) = 1 (log α1 - log α2) log n ∑ k6n ∑ {k: α16 kk 6α2} 1 kk ΔSν K ′ (ω). Then QN (ω) W - → µγ, N → ∞, for almost all ω ∈ ω. L and T R A T R A 1. Kolchin V.F., Sevastyanov B.A., Chistyakov V.P. Random placements. - M.: Fizatlit, 1976. - 223 p. 176 M.R. Timirshin Kazan State University, Timirshinm@yandex.ru Designs of unlimited measures on orthoprojectors, Let M - Algebra von Neumann. We denote through MPR and M+ classes of all orth projectors and positive operators (respectively) VM. Let 1 - an identical operator from M. Definition. Display µ: mpr → [0, + φ] is called a certain-adnsal measure on projectors, if p, q ∈Mpr, pq = 0 ⇒ µ (p + q) = µ (p) + µ (q). Measure µ is called unlimited if µ (1) = +urb. Measure µ is called semi -pointed if there is a network (pα) αion ⊂ ⊂mpr, such that pα ↗ 1, µ (pα) < + ¾, α ∈ A. The weight on the algebra von Neumanam is called the reflection ffic: m + → [0 , + Urb], possessing the properties: ∗ (x + y) = onic (x) + onic (y), onic (λx) = λ ventration (x), x, y ∈M +, λ> 0, while it is believed that it is believed that it is believed that 0 · φ = 0. New schemes for constructing clearly defined unlimited semi-endless endive measures on the algebra von Neumann orthoprojectors of a certain type, not continuing until weight. One of these schemes is a generalization of the approach proposed in the work [1]. Theorem 1. Let N - the counting of Abeli ​​Algebra von Neumann, is such that the identical operator 1 177 is presented as an endless sum of the final orthoprojectors from N. Let m = mn ⊗ n, where mn is algebra of square matrices of the order n, n ∈ [2, +urb). Then in M ​​there is an unlimited semi-endless of the end-adventive measure µ: mpr → [0, +urb], not continuing until the weight. Theorem 2. Let N - algebra von Neumann, such that it contains uni -naval minimal orth projectors P and Q. Let m = ⊕i], where I is an infinite set of indices. Then in M ​​there is an unlimited semi-endless of the end-adventive measure µ: mpr → [0, +urb], not continuing until the weight. In particular, as n you can take the algebra of all limited linear operators b (h) operating in the Hilbert space H, DIMH> 1. L and T R A T R A 1. Lugovayag.d., Sherstneva.n.
