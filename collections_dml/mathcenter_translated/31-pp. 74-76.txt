The algorithmic recognition of some properties of associative algebra 74 L. Yu. Kasapenko Ulyanovsk State University, L.Kasapenko@mail.ru The question of the algorithmic recognition of the algebraic dependence of the final family of free associative algebra is generally solved [1]. This paper considers the question of the algorithmic recognition of the free generation and the endlessness of the Zagalbra, set by the final standard basis in the associative standardly of course (p. About.) Algebra. Let K - the field of zero characteristics; X = {x1,. . . , xn} - arbitrary alphabet; <r> - a free half -group generated by many X; K <x> is a half -group algebra of the half group X above the field K, which is a free associative algebra of the rank n above the field K. Ideal I = (φ) denotes the ideal in k <x>, and the system φ = {f1,. . . , FM} generating ideal I forms its baze of the rowner. The Algebra factor A = k <x> /i is called p. K. About Algebra [2]. The concept of the standard basis of the linear landfill introduced into [3] made it possible to determine in [4] the concept of the standard basis in the Zagalgebra of the associative s. K. about. Algebra. In [4], the issue of recognizing the free generation and the endlessness of the Zagalbra, set by its final standard basis, has been positively resolved. Let Podalgebra b s. K. About algebras a = k <x> /i is set by its final standard basis g = {g1 ,. . . , gn}. Theorem 1. The algorithmically recognized property “B is a free Podalgebra with free generating G1 ,. . . , gn ". 75 Theorem 2. There is an algorithm for recognition of the endoedness of the algebra b.

X is called the space of incompatible curvature in the sense of Buzeman (see [1]), if for any three points x, y, z ∈ X, for the arbitrary middle M between X and Y and for the arbitrary middle n between x and z, non -76 is performed for non -76
