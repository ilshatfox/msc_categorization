Cases of permissibility in the quadrature of one equation of Voltaire in the region t = {x0 <x1, y0 <y <y1, z0 <z <z1} I. M. Shakirov 165, the equation U (x, y, z) + x∫ x0 is considered A (ă, y, z) u (₽, y, z) dă + y0 b (x, η, z) u (x, η, z) dη + + z∫ z0 c (x, y, ζ ζ ζ ζ ) u (x, y, ζ) dζ + x∫ x0 y∫ y0 d (ă, η, z) u (ă, η, z) d op + + x∫ x0 z∫ z0 e (ă, y, ζ) u (ă, y, ζ) dζd + + y0 z, z0 f (x, η, ζ) u (x, η, ζ) dζd type + + x∫ x0 y∫ y0 z0 g (cil, η, η, ζ) dζdηdă = φ (x, y, z), (1) where ayz, bxz, cxy, dz, ey, fx, g, φxyz ∈ C (t). Applying to (1) operator ∂3 ∂x∂y∂z, we get uxyz + auxy + buyz + cuxz + dux + euy + fuz + gu = φxyz, (2) a = c, c = b, d = BZ+CY+F, E = AZ+CX++E, F = AY+BX+D, G = BXZ+AYZ+CXY+DZ+Ey+FX+G. From (1) it is easy to see that the boundary values ​​of the problem of the GUR for the equation (2) u (x0, y, z) = ng (y, z), u (x, y0, z) = = ∗2 (x, z) , u (x, y, z0) = ∗3 (x, y) satisfy the integral equations of the type (1), but with two independent changes. In this case, from the integral equation for wor, it follows that, for example, each of the functions ising (y, z0) and uction (y0, z) is actually a solution to a certain ordinary line of the first order equation, that is, it is written in explicit form. All this means that for calculating ng (y, z), the classical task of Gurs receives. Based on the results from [1], we can make sure that 166 I. M. Shakirov Lemma 1. Let the functions m1, s1, t1, t1 ∈ C2 and at least one of the conditions: 1) [CB −bz - f] ( x0, y, z) ≡ 0; 2) [cb - cy - f] (x0, y, z) ≡ 0; 3) cy | (x0, y, z) ≡ bz | (x0, y, z), [cb −bz - f] (x0, y, z) ≡ ξ01 (y) η01 (z) 6 = 0; 4) [bz - cy] (x0, y, z) ≡ [cb −bz - f] (x0, y, z) ≡ ξ11 (y) η11 (z) 6 = 0; 5) [cy −bz] (x0, y, z) ≡ [cb - cy - f] (x0, y, z) ≡ ξ21 (x) η21 (y) 6 = 0; 6) [m1cy −bz] (x0, y, z) ≡ [m1bz - cy] (x0, y, z) ≡ ≡ (m1 - 1) [cb - cy −bz - f] (x0, y, z) ; (3) and or [cb −bz - f] (x0, y, z) = 2s′1 (y) t ′ 1 (z) (2–m1) [s1 (y) + t1 (z)] 2, either [cb - cy - f] (x0, y, z) = 2s′1 (y) t ′ 1 (z) (2 - m1) [s1 (y) + t1 (z)] 2, and s’s11 (y) t ′ 1 (z) 6 = 0, s1 (y) + t1 (z) 6 = 0, m 6 = 2. Then ffic is calculated in explicit form. There are 6 conditions of conditions, but in fact there are 7 of them, because The last of them contains two opportunities. Similar allegations (we will call them, respectively, see 2 and see 3) are fair for the functions onic and ∗3 with the corresponding conditions playing the role (3). Thus, equation (1) is reduced to the Gurs problem for the equation (2), or rather, to 73 = 343 tasks, since you can combine the calculated boundary values ​​of a given task, choosing one of the possibilities contained in each set of the form of the type (3) included in any of the Lemm 1-3. I. M. Shakirova 167 remains the last step: to build in quadrators the solution of the problem of the Gurs for the equation (2) with the boundary values ​​of ising (k = 1, 3). Using the results from [2, c.169] it is possible to record the following conditions that allow the implementation of this construction: ay ≡ bx, az ≡ cx, bz ≡ cy, az —Ac + e ≡ 0, bx −b + d ≡ 0, cy −bc + f ≡ 0, (4) namely, the theorem occurs. If the assumptions of LEMM 1-3 are performed (4), and the BAZ -ABZ+Ey -Af+G design is a product of the type λ (x) µ (y) ν (Z), then equation (1) is resolved in quadrature. L and T R A T R A 1.
