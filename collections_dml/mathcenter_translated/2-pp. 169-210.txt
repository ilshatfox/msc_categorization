THE ITERATIVE METHODS FOR MESH VARIATIONAL INEQUALITIES  Introduction  1.1. We consider the finite-dimensional variational inequalities (or inclusions) of one of the following classes:  Au+ Cu 3 f, (1)  which be refered as problem P1 or  Au+Bγ = f ; γ ∈ Cu, (2)  which we call by the problem P2. In these variational inequalities A ∈ L(RN ;RN ) corresponds to a mesh approximation (finite difference or finite element) of linear partial differential operator while nonlinear, generally multivalued, operator C is responsible for the constraints in the problem. As for the term Bγ, B ∈ L(RN ;RN ), it may be viewed as an approximation for the nonlinear convective term in the differential problem under consideration.  There are a lot of variational inequalities and differential inclusions of practical importance which mesh approximations lead to finite-dimensional problem of the first or second types. Namely, mesh schemes for obstacle problem and dam problem (mathematical model constructed using Baiocchi transformation), implicit mesh schemes on the fixed time level for one-phase or two-phase Stefan problem and  169    some others can be written as the problem P1. On the other hand, mesh approximations on fixed time level for Stefan-like problems with nonlinear convective terms and the problems of fluid flows in porous medium under the gravity forces have the form P2.  Below in section 1.2 we construct finite difference or finite element schemes for some model problems. These mesh schemes have the form P1 or P2.  In S1 of this article we study existence and uniqueness of the solutions for problems P1 and P2. The existence of the solutions for both problems are proved using rather standard technique. The proof of the uniqueness of the solution for the problem P2 is based on the comparison results of [8], which play the crucial role also in the analysis of the convergence for iterative methods of relaxation types.  Iterative methods for P1 and P2 are constructed and studied in S2 and S3. We pay special attention to iterative methods constructed on the basis of domain decomposition technique, both with overlapping and non-overlapping subdomains. In S2 we unit in one class block coordinate relaxation methods, multisplitting methods, alternative Schwarz methods and study their convergence for P1, P2 with M -matricies A and B. Splitting iterative methods and their application to domain decomposition methods with nonoverlapping subdomains are studied for the problem P1 with positive definite matrix A in S3. The main results here are the rate of convergence and theoretically optimal choice of iterative parameters.  The article ends with the Appendix, in which some results on the monotone operators, M -matricies and convex functions theories are collected.  The iterative methods based on the domain decomposition are thoroughly studied for linear equations, see the books [15],[16], survey articles [2], [10] and proceedings of conferences on DDM. A few articles deal with the Schwarz alternating iterative methods for some classes of variational inequalities, which can be written in the form P1 (or its generalization for nonlinear A), namely [4], [5], [11], [12], [18], [19], [20], [21]. Moreover, as a rule, convergence results are proved if starting from specially choosen initial guess (super- or subsolution for the studied problem according to terminology of this article). More general results on the convergence of iterative methods for P1 as well as several results for problem P2 are studied in [8].  170    The splitting algorithms for finding a zero of the sum of two maximal monotone operators were studied in [13], [3]. Some error bounds for these methods were obtained in the case when A is single-valued monotone and Lipschitz-continuous operator. Better error bounds were derived in [6] for the case of linear self-adjoint operator A and in [9] for the case of nonlinear operator A. .  Two-lewel iterative method with positive definite, non self-adjoint, preconditioner for P1 where C = ∂IK (∂IK is the subdifferential of indicator function for a convex set K ) was studied in [17]. It was shown that this method can be treated as the partial case of splitting method for sum of two maximal monotone operators and its convergence was proved. We refer to [17] also for bibliograthy of the papers concerning the splitting methods for variational inequalities.  1.2. Several examples of variational inequalities (VI’s) and their mesh approximations  Let Ω be a polygonal domain in R2 with boundary ∂Ω. By H1(Ω) we denote the Sobolev space of the functions u ∈ L2(Ω) such that ∂u ∂xi ∈ L2(Ω) ∀i. We equip this space by the inner product (u, v) =∫  Ω (uv + ∇u∇v)dx and the corresponding norm ||u||H1 =  √ (u, u).  The functions from H1(Ω) which traces in the boundary ∂Ω are equal to zero form the space H10 (Ω).  Example 1. Let K = {u ∈ H10 (Ω) : u(x) ≥ 0 a.e. in Ω} be the convex closed set in H10 (Ω) . We look for the following VI which is tradition
