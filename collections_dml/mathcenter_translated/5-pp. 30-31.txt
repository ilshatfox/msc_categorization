L. W. Bakhtieva, L. D. Eskin {Kazan) On the integral equation of the theory of phase transitions and thermodynamic properties of the Ellipsoidal particles system Orientational phase transitions in the system of anisotropic suspicimetric particles are described by the global solution of the non -linear equation of the orientation of the particles (1] . The most important property of this integral equation is the invariability of its nucleus while turning the particles of the particles. This property made it possible to examine in detail the help of the theory of bifurcation [2] the anisotropic branch of the Gjya, which branches from isotropic, and with the help of numerical methods and the second anisotropic The branch with the pain norm. The resulting cuttings are used to study the terpine properties of the system of ellipsoidal particles (UR Avil, chemical potential, etc.) depending on the concentration of particles and their geometry. 31
