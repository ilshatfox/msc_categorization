A more general scheme of series of different stripped random quantities that satisfy the condition of Lindsberg. obtained by NRA/L: Fir Theorems are used in some models of stohy • 1S financial mathematics. Three financial models are built: a market with permanent • Sew agencies, a market with reducing items the number of agents, the market with increasing • 1is; yum agents. For each model, we build a random nrotses that determines the market • the cost of shares. Also for each, 11.
