The structure of the operates of tournaments L. T. Abdulmyanov Kazan State University, lilabd@rambler.ru uses information from the theory of the OpeD, which can be found in [1] and [2]. Through DIR, we denote the opera of simple oriented graphs (see [2]). Let Tour (N) ⊆ DIR (N) - many tournaments with n peaks equipped with MI 1, 2 label ,. . . , n. Various arrangements of the labels give various elements Tour (N). Recall that the tournament is called such a simple oriented graph in which for any two times personal vertices I, J exists either arc I - → J, or the arc J - → I. Put Tour = {Tour (n) | n = 1, 2 ,. . .}. Theorem 1. Tour - suboperda of the Dir Opeads. Through los (n) we denote many of all such guidelines from DIR (N), which are linearly stinging with the daily sets. Theorem 2. Los = {los (n) | n = 1, 2 ,. . .} - suboperda Dir Opeads. There is an isomorphism of the OPD Los ∼ = σ (Operad σ is defined in [3]). Consider the suboperadu Tourc Tour Opeads, generated by a cycle C, that is, a tournament with peaks 1, 2, 3 and arcs 1-→ 2, 2-→ 3, 3-→ 1. Theorem 3. The Tourc Operations is isomorphic to the factor of the factor of his body operating operators Foω with the basis ω, consisting of one mental element ω ∈ Foω (3), according to the congruence generated by the element (σω, ω) ∈ Foω (3) × Foω (3), where σ = (1, 2, 3) ∈ σ3 . It is assumed that each suboperade of the operating operates of the moat, generated by a simple tournament P with the number of vertices N> 3, is a factor of the free FOPA operates with the basis of 3 ω, consisting of one element ω ∈ FOL (N), by consistency generated by all pairs (σω, ω), where σ ∈ σn are such that σp = p, and that the operating of all tournaments is the co -prose of the LOS Opeads and all subservipes generated by a simple tournaments with the number of vertices of at least three.

Analysis of sound information based on continuous owl-transformation by D. A. Abramov Kazan State University considers the task of spectral analysis of sound information presented by the ultimate length signal. The software complex capable of selling the capture of the sound signal with the subsequent decomposition of it into the spectrum. The analysis of spectral information allows you to identify some invariant frequency-temporal characteristics of the sign, which is necessary when solving such problems as identical to the voice (isolation of the main signal frequency), knowledge of speech, and improvement of a noisy signal. 4
