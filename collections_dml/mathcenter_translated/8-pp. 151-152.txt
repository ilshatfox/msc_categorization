The central maximum theorem for the multiplier orthogonal system of functions through χn (x), n = 0, 1, 2, · · · ·; x ∈ [0, 1], we denote the periodic multiplier orthonomated system of functions (abbreviated - PMONS), determined by the sequence of simple numbers {pk} (for a detailed definition, see, for example, in [1]). Let {nk} - a certain lacunal sequence of numbers, subordinate (starting with some K) condition: nk + 1 nk ≥ 1 + ω (k) at k = 1, 2, ... where ω (k) decreases monotonously ( But not faster to some degree Kα, 0 <α <1). Determine the values: f (0) = 0, f (k + 1) = max {i: ni <mk}, k = 0, 1, 2 ,. . .; Bk = √ f (k + 1), p̃k = max {pi: 1 ≤ i ≤ k + 1}. In [2], the question of the subordination of the sequence {χink (x)} (interpreted as a sequence of two -dimensional random vectors) central maximum theorem was studied. Sufficient conditions for the implementation of the CPT were obtained (theorem a) in the case when the PK numbers, structuring the system, are limited in aggregate. 151 The next result spreads the theorem a in case limk → φPK = inous. Theorem. If, in the conditions of theorem A (see [2]), the growth of the PK numbers is due to the ratio lnp̃k = o (bk · ω (b2k)) with k → ∞, then the subsystem {χnk (x)} is subordinated to the CPT (in the sense of determining from [2 ]).

Potashev (Kazan) Optimization of the shape of an arc, streamlined near a horizontal screen when designing wing profiles is important is the task of finding a form of a profile that provides optimal aerodynamic characteristics. One of the tasks of this kind is the task of determining the wing profile with maximum lifting force. The solution to this problem for the handle of a given length and limited curvature was obtained by M. A. Lavrentiev [1]. The result of such optimization is a circumference. The work is dedicated to the numerical solution of the problem of Lavrentiev for arches near the horizontal screen. The task is reduced to the search for a control function that delivers extremum to the target functionality when limiting the curvature of an arc. By approaching the control function of the segment of the steppe 152
