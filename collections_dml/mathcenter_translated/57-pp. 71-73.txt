The Inclusion of Generalized Sobolev Spaces M Pα (X) Intinous Functions in the Critical Case S.A. Bondarev let (x, d, µ) be a space of homogeneous type with doimension γ. Inclusion of Generalized Sobolev Spaces M Pα (X) (p is a summability parameter, α is a smoothness parameter) into the Space of Continous Function in the Critical Case γ = αp IS Discussed. It is shown, that, Under certain controls on the Space (X, D, µ), for P ≤ 1, α> 0, Any Function from m pα (x) Locally Has an Unified Continous Representative. Keywords: Analysis on Metric Measure Spaces, Sobolev Spaces. UDC 517.54 Extreme display in the task of Sege-Belly Ya.V. Borisova1 1 borisova_yana@list.ru; Tomsk State University in this work The Jequinaste Problem is solved by a variation method. A functional-radio equation for the boundary display of the functionality in question is. With material values ​​of the parameter, boundary 72 materials of the school-conference of the display were found. The geometry of the boundary display has been established. Key words: functionality, holomorphic one -leaf display, boundary display, variation method. Let S - the set of all the holomorphic one -leafy in the circle E = {z ∈ C: | z | <1} display f: e → c, f (z) = z + c2z2 + c3z3 + .... The classic task of the feces and segha [1-3] is considered about finding many values ​​of functionality I: S → R, I (F) = Re (C3 γC22), γ ERR. The variation method [4] establishes that the boundary display of the functionality satisfies the differential equation Q F (Z) +1 F 4 (Z) F ′ 2 (Z) = Z 4 +Qz3 +BZ2 +QZ +1 Z4, where Q = 2 (1 --Γ) c2, b = 2i (f). Using a qualitative analysis, it was established that the right part of this equation has the form Q F (Z) +1 F 4 (Z) F ′ 2 (Z) = (Z - - µ) 2 (Z - type) 2 z4 (1) or a form q f (z) +1 f 4 (z) f ′ 2 (z) = (z - - µ) 2 (z ξ) (z - 1 ă) z4, (2) where | µ | = 1, | η | = 1, | ctor | <1. Theorem. With γ ∈ (0.1), the maximum functionality is max f ∈S I (F) = 1+2E −2γ 1- - the solution of the equation (1) with material coefficients in the extension of zero, which is implicitly set in the form of 2E - γ1- γ ln 1+ √ 1-4e - γ 1-–γ f 1 - √ 1-4e - γ 1- γ f - √ 1-4e - γ 1–γ f = −1 z + z −2e - γ 1–––s LN Z, and F displays a single circle on a plane with cuts on three analytical arcs connecting at a point 1 4 e γ 1 - at equal angles, one of which goes to infinity. With γ <0, the maximum functionality of max f ∈S I (F) = 3 - 4γ delivers an equalization solution (2) with material coefficients in the extension of zero, belonging to the Keba family. With γ> 1, the maximum functionality of max f ∈S I (f) = −3+4γ delivers the solution of equation (2) with the coefficients C2N -1 ∈ R, I C2N ∈ R in the extension of zero belonging to the KEB family.

Bratishchev1 1 avbratishchev@spark-mail; Don State Technical University Let the autonomous system of differential equations of the nth order have an invariant set. For a state of balance on this set, we form a Jacobi matrix of the right side of the system. The work proposes a formulantactorization of this matrix. The formula is useful in the task of designing regulators of dynamic systems. Key words: autonomous system, invariant set, equilibrium state, characteristic polynomial.
