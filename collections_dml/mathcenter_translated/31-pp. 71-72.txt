. An example of an ecbphin display of T.V. Zudin Volzhsky branch of the Moscow Road Institute (State Technical University), ZTV77@mail.ru 1. Let there be two N-dimensional diversity m and m̄ with ecc byphic sl (n, r) structures ( ∇, ω) and (∇̄, ω̄), respectively, each of which consists of coherence without twisting and not converting to zero covariantly constant in this connectedness of the N-form (see [1]). Then diphenomorphism f: m → m̄ is called an exiyffin display if the n-form f ∗ (ω̄) belongs to SL (n, r)-the structure of diversity m, i.e., f ∗ (ω̄) = cω for the constant C> 0. The last how easy it is to install, it is performed only when and only when the tensor de 72
