The approximate solution of the problem of filtering viscoplastic fluid to the horizontal well is an accurate formula for calculating the flow rate of a vertical well in a circular layer with a non -linear filtration law with the maximum gradient has [1]: Q = 2πkh µ ln (Rk RC) (4p - γ (Rk - RC) ), 4p> γ (rk - rc), (1) q = 0, 4p 6 γ (rk - rc), where k is the permeability of the formation, h - its thickness, rk is the radius of the power circuit, 4p is the pressure drop, γ - The maximum gradient, µ is the viscosity of the liquid, RC is the radius of the well. An approximate formula for calculating the flow rate of a horizontal well (GS) is obtained if in (1) replace RC with the given radius of R′C. The above radius is determined from the condition of the equality of the flow rate of the fittal of the “enlarged” vertical well of the radius R′C in the case of linear filtration in a circular layer. Let the length of the GS be L and its axis is defended from the sole of the layer at a distance of δ. The beginning of the coordinates will be placed in the center of the GS, and the X axis will be directed along the axis of the well. Replace the GS with a linear source of uniform intensity. In a dimensionless form, the exact solution of the problem of stationary filtration of the Newtonian fluid to the GS in a circular layer has the form PD = ln (rkd)+1+σ (xd, yd)+φ∑ n = 1 f (ă2n) cos ₽ 2 nδd cos ₽ 2 n 2 n (δd+zd), (2) 128 σ (α, β) = 0.25 {(α -1) ln [α - 1) 2] - (α+1) ln [α+1) 2] 2] 2] - - 2β Arctan 2β α2 + β2 - 1}, f (β) = 1∫ −1 k0 (√ β √ (xd - α) 2 + y2d) dα, where PD = 2πkh4p/(µq), ld = 2l/2l/2l/2l/2l/2l/2l/2l/2l/2l/2l/2l/2l L, cil = nπ/hd, k0 (x) - modified function of the subsitient of the second type of 0 -order. Formula (2) was obtained on the basis of an asymptotic solution to the problem of non -stationary filtering of the liquid to the GS in a circular layer [2]. If you put in it XD = ZD = 0, YD = RCD, then we get the formula V.P. Pilatovsky. With HD <2 formula V.P. Pilatovsky is greatly simplified and takes the form Q = 2πkh4p µ ln (rk/r′c), r′c = l 2e (2πrc h sin πδ h) h/l. The condition for the constancy of pressure in the HS is accurately approximated if in (2) put XD = 0.74, YD = 0, ZD = RCD. With HD <1.74, we get an analogue of the formula Yu.P. Borisova [1]: q = 2πkh4p µ ln (rk/r′c), r′c = l 4 (2πrc h sin πδ h) h/l. The task of filtering viscoplastic fluid to the GS in a circular layer was solved numerically by the final elements. With a non -stationary influx of liquid to the GS, put into work with a constant moron, at each moment in the layer two areas are formed in the layer - the filtering area and the zone where the current is absent. Over time, the border between these zones moves from GS to the power contour. Numeric calculations showed that at small times, the pressure in the GS practically does not depend on the value of the limit gradient γ, and the deviation of the pressure from the linear filtration mode occurs in later times and increases with the growth of γ. An additional difference in 129 pressure 4pγ = γ (rk - r′c), which is lost to overcoming the shift gradient, is well consistent with the results of the numerical calculations of the stationary tributary of the liquid to the GS.

Nuriev Kazan State University, artem501@list.ru Stationary flow in a cavity with a mobile lid with high Reynolds numbers The flat task of the flow of incompatible fluid in a square cavity with a mobile upper lid over the past 40 years attracts the constant attention of specialists in computational hydrodynamics . It actually became test during the testing of new discrete schemes for solving the equations of Navier - Stox. Particular importance in this case is attached to the construction of stationary solutions of the problem under the large numbers of Reynolds [1 - 3]. In this work, the stationary problem is solved by ended methods in primary variables on a uniform grid with span nodes. The diverse scheme has 130 second accuracy procedure due to the central-growth approximation of convective members. The solution to a nonlinear grid problem is carried out It is carried out It is carried out using the ideas proposed in [4]. The next approximation is sought according to the previous one as V (n + 1) = (1– ω) v (n) + ωv, where V is the solution of the linear mesh problem of the type V (n) · ∇ (Up) H v - re -1∆hvvvv +∇hp = v (n) · (∇ (up) h v (n) — ∇hv (n)), ∇h · v = 0. Here ∆H is the net analogue of the Laplass operator, ∇H and ∇ (UP) H meets central and directed and directed up the stream of approximation of the corresponding derivatives. The use of directed differences provides a diagonal predominance of the transition matrix, which allows you to use a high -performance multi -section method when solving a net problem. The geometric version of this method [3] was used with a single W-cycle on each iteration. The calculations were carried out in the range of 0 6 re 6 5 · 104 on detailed grids (up to 40962 knots) with the provision of a wire not exceeding 10-10. The relaxation parameter ω monotonously changed from the unit with small re to 0.1 at RE = 5 · 104. In a typical
