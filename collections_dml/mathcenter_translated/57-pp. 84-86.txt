Stock, St. Petersburg National Research University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics (ITMO University) The task is the task of constructing material amplitude -frequency operators for differentiation and extrapolation of analytical functions. The method of constructing these operators is proposed by regulating the interpoiled function by adding an integral component special type to it. Keywords: numerical differentiation, numerical extrapolation, amplitude-frequency operators, regulators. Recall that the amplitude-frequency amounts (operators) of the order not higher than N are called the functions of Hn (h; z) = hn ({µk}, {λk}, h; z): = n∑ k = 1 µk h (λk z) , z ∈C, (1) where {µk, λk} n k = 1 - free complex parameters (respectively, amplitudes and frequencies), and H is an analytical function in a single circle. [1] considered the issue of resolving the problem of 2n-time interpolation to the case f (z) −hn ({µk}, {λk}, h; z) = o (z2n), z → 0, (2) analytical in the vicinity The start of functions F by choosing the parameters µk = µk (f, h, n) and λk = λk (f, h, n). There, for example, it is shown that the task (2) is solved and, moreover, the only way if the relations of the Taylor coefficients of functions F and H satisfy the special determinant condition of the penny. Such a case is called regular. A regular case is obtained, for example, if f (z) = 1z ∫ z - z h (t) d t. At the same time, the interpolation ampolation and frequency of the opera is built in explicitly and (2) takes the form of a well-known quiss 1 z ∫ z h (t) d t ≈h intn (h; z), (3) accurate on algebraic polynomials h. degree not higher than 2N - 1. In the operator h inten, the amplitudes {µk} n k = 1 are positive, and the frequencies {λk} n k = 1 are zeros of the polynomial of the Lyandra and belong to the segment [−1,1]. In addition, µk and λk do not depend on h. D.G. Vasilchenkova, V.I. Danchenko, P.V. Chunaev 85, in case of failure to fulfill the condition of the Proni (irregular case), the issue of the existence of a solution to the problem (2) has not been studied, which noticeably narrows the scope of amplitude-frequency operators. This situation takes place, for example, when trying to build amplitude -frequency operators for approximate differentiation (this corresponds to the case F (Z) = (ZH (Z) ′) or extrapolation (for f (z) = h (az) and fixed a> 1 ). In [1], however, the regulatory of these two tasks was proposed by subtracting from an interpoled function F of a special binom of the type BP, Q (Z; H): = PZN -1 +Qz2N -1, P, Q ∈C. It was shown that there are complex numbers p = p (h) and q = q (h), for which the corresponding amplitude-frequency operators exist and are built in the only way, A (2) takes the form (ZH (Z) ′ = BP, q (h; z)+h difn (h; z)+o (z2n), h (az) = bp, 0 (h; z)+h extn (h; z)+o (z2n), (4) Where amplitudes and frequencies {µk, λk} n k = 1 do not depend on H and in this sense are unequal. We also note that in the second equality of frequency satisfies the condition | λk | <a, which makes it extrapolation. Nevertheless, formulas (4) turn out to be inconvenient in practice when working with materially digesting functions H on a real axis, since the parameters appearing in them are often complex. To overcome this drawback in this note, a different regulatory method consists in subtracting from the interpoled function F integral IM (h; z): = m z ∫ z 0 h (t) d t, m> 0. We have proven the following statements. Theorem 1. with a certain m = m (n)> 0 is true equality (zh (z) ′ = IM (h; z)+h rdifn (h; z)+o (z2n), where in h rdifn are positive, The frequencies are material and all of them do not depend on h. Equality is accurate on polynomials H no higher than 2n −1. Theorem 2. For any M> 0 and A> 1, equality h (AZ) = IM (h; z)+h rextn (h; z)+o (z2n) is true, where in h rextn amplitudes are positive, frequencies are material and all They do not depend on h. Moreover, the frequencies belong to the interval [0, a), i.e. The indicated equality is extrapolation. Equality is a marginal marty of degree not higher than 2n −1. Note that the regulatory integral IM (h; z) in the theorems itself is well approached by the amplitude-frequency amount according to the Gauss formula (3).
