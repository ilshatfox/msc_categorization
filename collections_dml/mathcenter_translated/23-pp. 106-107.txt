) The norm of the operator of the lagrange in the multidimensional spaces of Sobolev Let HS (s ∈ R) - the space of Sobolev functions m of variables with the usual norm. We will assume the condition s> m/2, which ensures the investment of HS in the space of continuous functions. We fix N = (n1, n2, ..., nm) ∈ NM, enter into [−π, π] m mesh of equivalent nodes ∆n = {tk = (tk1, tk2, ..., tkm) | tk ∈ Zm, | kj | ≤ nj, j = 1, 2, ..., m} and designate the lagrange operator through PN, compares each function U ∈ HS trigonometric interpolation (pnu) (τ) = ∑ tkorn u (tk) m∏ j = 1 sin ((2nj + 1) (τj - tkj)/2) (2nj + 1) sin ((τj - tkj)/2), τ ∈ [−π, π] m. In [1] it is shown that with m = 1 ‖pn‖hs → hs ≤ √ 1 + ζ (2s), where ζ (t) = ∑icle l = 1 l –t. In [2] This result is generalized in case M ≥ 2. Namely, in this case ‖pn‖hs → Hs ≤ 2 m --S 2 m s + 1 2 m (n, s) √ 1 + ζ (2s --m + 1), 108 m (n, s) = (√ n21 + n 2 2 + ... + n 2 m min (n)) s. LISTOV 1. Fedotov A. I.

Shamsudinov (Kurgan-Taube, Tajikistan, Faizullo100@yahoo.com) about one second-order system with a super-sengular point, let the rectangle, d = {0 <x <δ1, 0 <y <δ2}. Next, we denote γ1 = {y = 0, 0 <x <δ1}, γ2 = {x = 0, 0 <y <Δ2}. In the area D, consider the UXY + system (AJ (X, Y)/R αJ) ux + (bj (x, y)/r βj) uy + (cj (x, y)/r αj + βj) u = = fj (x, y)/r αj + βj, (1) where r2 = x2 + y2, aj (x, y), bj (x, y), cj (x, y), fj (x, y) - specified The functions of the region D, βj are integers, j = 1, 2. The study of differential equations and systems with singular and ultra -orgular coefficients is devoted to a lot of work. In this message, on the basis of a method developed by N. Rajabov, a representation of the variety of system solutions (1) was obtained. In the future, we denote the class of functions through C2 (D), which have continuous derivatives of the first order in D and such that uxy ∈ C (D). The theorem has been proven. Let in the system of equations (1) for αj = 2, βj> 2, j = 1, 2, coefficients and right parts satisfy the following conditions: 1) a1 (x, y) ∈ C ′ (D), B1 (X, B1 (X, B1 (X, B1 (X, B1 (x, y), c1 (x, y), f1 (x, y) ∈ C (D); 109
