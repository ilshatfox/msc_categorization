Materials of the International School-Conference of UDC 512 on one class (3.3)-a-home quantum logic with an even number of atoms F.F. Sultanbekov1 1 foat.sultanbekov@kpfu.ru; The Kazan (Volga) Federal University in the article built (3.3)-aiding quantum logic with an arbitrary even number of atoms, starting from 18. For these logic groups, their groups of automorphisms are described. Keywords: quantum logic, (3.3)-Rodic logic, group of autorphisms. Quantum logic L is called (M, N) -Dorous if any atom is contained exactly in maximum, relative to inclusion, orthogonal sets of atoms (called blocks), and each block L contains exactly n atoms. In this logic, M · Card a = N · Cardb, where a is many of all atoms L, B are many of all its blocks [2]. A necessary condition for the existence of a two -digit state f on l is: (card a)/n = (cardb)/m = card [f −1 (1) ∩a] [1], [2]. The author in [2] built an example (2.3) -Dorous logic with 96 atoms without two-digit conditions. Groups of automorphisms for some finite homogeneous logic are described in [3]. At previous conferences of 2013, 2015, (3.3) are examined in detail (3.3)-aiding logic with 18 and 19 atoms and their states spaces are described. Atoms (3.3) -togodny logic l denote non-negative integers. Let N - an odd natural number not less than 9, l (2n) = {0.1, ..., 2n - 1}, the family B consists of blocks of the species {2i, 2i +1.2i +2} and blocks of the species {2 j −5,2 j, 2 j +5}, where i, j ∈ {0.1, ..., n −1} and all numbers are considered according to module 2n. Theorem. L (2N) with the above blocks is (3.3)-a-home quantum logic. The group of automorphisms Logic L (2N) consists of 2N elements and is generated by two automorphisms: T (K) = K +2, S (K) = 2N −K. Literature 1. Ovchinnikov P. G.
