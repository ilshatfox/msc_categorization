Numerical modeling of natural convection of viscous fluid in the canal with several heaters M. Yu. Garnyshev, E. I. Kalinin, A. B. Mazo Kazan State University, mgarnysh@rambler.ru considered a flat task of natural convection of viscous fluid in a vertical channel with placed placed In it heators γi, where I = 1 ,. . . , N. The heater temperature is constant and equal to Ti, the walls of the canal are thermal insulated, and the Jew bone at the input to the canal has a temperature equal to zero. At the initial point in time, the liquid rests. Rice. 1 In the Cartesian system of coordinates with a vertical axis X (Fig. 1) the Equation of Navier -Keen and convective thermal conductivity in the approximation of the Bossinnes, describing the studied process, in dimensionless quantities are [1, 2] ∂t ∂t + ~ v · gradt = 1 PE ∆T, (1) –PHO = ω; ω = ∂vx ∂x - ∂vy ∂y, vx = ∂ ∂y, vy = - ∂ ∂x; (2) ∂ω ∂t + ~ v · gradω = 1 re ∆ω + ∂t ∂y. (3) 51 here T - the temperature of the liquid, t - time, ~ v = (vx, vy) - the speed of the current, ψ - the function of the current, ω - swirling, pe, re - the numbers of Pekle and Reynolds. To determine the boundary values ​​of the current function, we use the approach [3]: γbot: ψ = 0, γtop: ψ = q, γi: ψ = ψi. (4) the parameters of Q and ψi are determined with the help of the auxiliary functions ηq, ηi, which are the decisions of the following regional tasks: ∆ηq = 0; Γtop: ∂ηq ∂n = 1; (5) γin, γout, γi: ∂ηq ∂n = 0; Γbot: ηq = 0; ∆ηi = 0; γi: ∂ηi ∂n = 1; (6) γin, γout, γtop, γk 6 = i: ∂ηi ∂n = 0; Γbot: ηi = 0, where n is the external normal. From the ratios (2), (5), (6) the expressions for Q and ψi: Q = 1 | γTOP | ∫ D ωηq dd; ψi = 1 | γi | ∫ D ωη DD. (7) here | γTOP |, | γI | - lengths of the corresponding boundaries, D is the calculation area. The boundary conditions for ω are displayed from the conditions of adhesion on the walls ∂∂/∂n = 0. from (2) the integral also ∫ d ωη dd = ∫ d ∇ · ∇η dd, (8) in which η is an arbitrary trial function. The values ​​obtained from (8) ω on the boundaries are used to solve equalization (3). 52 Problem (1) - (3), (4), (7), (8) was solved in numerically by the method of unreal elements for PE = 100, RE = 100, D = [–20, 60] × [−10, 10, 10 ]. The current lines and the temperature field for the convective flow of the liquid in the channel with two heaters with temperatures T1 = 1, T2 = 0.8 are shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that near each of the heaters the current is localized in the vicinity of the sunnal jet, while the temperature field has the character of the “mushroom”, which is transferred by an induced contextual stream. The results obtained qualitatively with the previously known [4]. -10 0 10 20 30 40 40 -10 -5 0 5 10 -10 0 10 20 30 40 -10 -5 0 5 10 Fig. 2 Work was carried out with the support of the RFFI, project 04-01-00484.

Small Abelian groups regarding various classes of the Abel groups I.V. Gerdt Tomsk State University Let K is a certain class of abele groups. We will call Abelev a small relatively k, or k-mala, if for any family of groups {bi} i organ, where bi ∈ K for any i ∈ I is performed by Hom (a, ⊕ i organ bi) ∼ = ⊕ ⊕ ⊕ ⊕ ⊕ ⊕ ⊕ ⊕ ⊕ I∈I Hom (a, bi). If class K coincides with the class of all abele groups, then the K-small group A will be called small. In [1], the properties of the K-small groups were studied and a complete description of small and D-small aboles groups was obtained, where D is the class of all divided aboles groups. Theorem 1. The following conditions for the Abel group A are equivalent: 1) A-D-small group; 2) a - of course the generated group; 3) a - a small group. Let < - the class of all reduced abele groups. The following result was obtained. 54
