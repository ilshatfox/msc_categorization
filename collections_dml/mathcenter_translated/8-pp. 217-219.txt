) Quasianalytic and task of the conductor, let D is a single -bonded limited area in C with a hidden border and mn> 0, n = 0, ..., - some of the latter is 217 vinity. Through h (d, mN) we denote the class of functions F, the holomorphic in D and satisfying the condition: there are numbers cf, qf> 0 such that max zatory | f (n) (z) | ≤ cfqnf mN for all n = 0, 1, ... due to the limitations of the derivative f (n+1) (z) BD function F (n) will be evenly limited in D and therefore there are maximum boundary values ​​for all derivatives. Class H (D, MN) is called quasi -enyalistic at the boundary point Z0 ∈ ∂D, if there is no non -zero function in this class, treating all derivatives at zero at the point Z0. The task of the conditions for the sequence of MN, necessary and sufficient for quasi-analyticalness, dates back to the problem of Adamar with the answer in the Danzhua-Carleman theorem (see [1]): let T (R) = SUP N≥0 Rn/MN-the Function of the Sugue Protection Mn. Class H (I, MN) is quasi -analytical at the point x0 ∈ I ⊂ r, then and only when ∫ φ 1 ln t (r) r2 dr = inous. The criterion of quasi -analytics at the point Z = 0 class h (∆K, mN), where ∆ seo is the angle of solution γπ with a vertex in zero, is obtained by Salinas in [2], for the boundary point of the circle, the condition of the quasi is given by theorem of the corybias [3]. The criterion of quasi -analytics at the boundary point Z0 is a convex limited area D is considered in the work [4]. This work is dedicated to the problem of quasi -analystness at the boundary point of the non -pool region. The sequence is mn = mn/n!, N = 0, 1, ..., is called an attached sequence. We assume that the sequence (MN) satisfies the following conditions: 1) m2n ≤ mn -1mn+1, n = 1, 2, ...; 2) there is a number q> 0 such that mn+1 ≤ qnmn, n = 0, 1, ...; 3) there is a ratio of lim n → و M 1 n n = inous. Determine the function M (x) = SUP K≥0 1 mkxk, x> 0. through g about 218, the image is significant with inversion w = 1/z additions D. The theorem has been proven. Class H (D, Mn) will not be quasi -ianaltical and only when there is a single -link area g ′ ⊃ g, such that it is solved in it the task of the conductor with values ​​on the border LN M (D (W)/| W | 2).
