One task for an equation with a senior private derivative in a three -dimensional space we consider the equation of the order m = m1 + m2 + ms of the type L (u) = l aq1q2qgz; 2z; e = 0: 5q;: 5m;, i = l, 3 (1) We believe that A E C (Qi, Q2, QE) F E C Class C (Ki, ..., KN) means' QIQ2QZ • · · the existence and continuity of all derivatives DL1+ ... +ln/dx'1 ln (l · - o k ·. - 1 n) 1 ... xn ' -' •. • '"i -' let the region D is a part of the characteristic parallelepiped, the plane formed during the intersection Tei XI = XIO, XI = XI1, I = 1.3, trotted with the uncharacteristic surface S from the angle (x10, x20, hzo). Task: Find the regional solving equation (1) that satisfies the conditions = uik; , I = g, Z, where II is the external normal to s, XI - the edges D at XI = XIO · KR of that, the conditions for coordination should be met on the curves SNX;. We will draw through point M (~ 1.6.6) of the plane X1 = 6, x2 = 6, xs = 6, which are cut off from D parallelepiped D 1. Integri with the development of identity from (1] in region D 1, the formula for the posed task was obtained. 185 Literature 1. Mironov A. N. On the method of Riman D.L..
