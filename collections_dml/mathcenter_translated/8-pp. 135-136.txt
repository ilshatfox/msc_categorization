Izerized logarithmic assessments of the speed of convergence of the methods of solving linear operator equations in the hyalbert space H is considered the operator equation AU = F, where a ∈ L (H, H), A ∗ = A ≥ 0, σ (A) ⊂ [0, m]. It is assumed that R (A) 6 = R (A), F ∈ R (A). The class of methods of approximation of the closest to the chosen initial approximation ă ∈ H The solution U ∗ This equation Uα = (i θ (a, α) ă + θ (α) f, α ∈ (0, α0]. (1) is investigated. To obtain assessments of the speed of the method of method (1), the condition of the source of the initial inevitability is used U ∗ - ₽ = [ln ln.. [1], what if u ∗ ∗ peace = ( - ln a) −pv, p> 0 and SUP λM (0, m] | 1– λθ (λ, α) | ( - ln λ) −p ≤ c0 ( - ln α) −p ∀α ∈ (0, α0], (3) (m ∈ (0, 1)), then the assessment is ‖uα - u ‖ ≤ c1 ( - ln α) − α ∈ (0, α0], α0 ∈ (0, 1). Suppose that the generating function θ (λ, α) for some µ0, β0 ∈ (0, 1) satisfies the condition | 1– µθ (µ, β) | ≤ c2 ∣∣∣∣∣1 - (ln 1 µ) −1 θ ((ln 1 µ) −1, (ln 1 β) −1) ∣∣∣∣∣ (4) ∀µ ∈ (0, µ0] ∀β ∈ (0, β0]. We go off the sequence {mk}: m1 = 1, mk = emk - 1, k = 2, 3 .... theorem. Let ‖a‖ ≤ m, where m ∈ (0, m - 11n ) and the conditions (2) - (4) are fulfilled. Then the assessment ‖uα - u ‖ ≤ c3 [ln ln ... ( - ln α)] - p ∀α ∈ (0, is fair (0, α0], α0 ∈ (0, M - 1N) (n characters LN). The condition (4) is satisfied with the functions θ (λ, α), which generate the method of M. M.

On the criteria for slow convergence of methods for solving linear equations // reverse and incorrectly set tasks (thesis of Dokl. Conc.). –M.: Moscow State University, 2000. - C. 39. A.P. Kolesnikov (Moscow) Basics in local convex spaces, the calculation of topological bases in local convex spaces is associated with the clarification of the conditions of existence and constructing homomorphisms acting from a given LVP E into some separately separated LVP, the basis in which exists. The functional implementation of E as a vector space of continuous numerical functions is considered, that is, the linear functionality (dirac function) δt: <x, δt> = x (t), x (t) ∈ E, t ∈ K ⊂ T (t - t - t - t - t - t - t - Locally compact space, k - compact in T). Theorem. Let E and F - separated by the LVP, a: e → f - linear continuous, and, therefore, the slightly continuous display E in f, a ′ is its conjugated display, which is the weak isomorphism of the space F ′ in E ′. Let the many a ′ (F ′) ⊂ e ′ total on e and Δt ∈ A ′ (F ′). If E is completely full, and F is sideways, then A is the topological isomorphism of the spaces e and f. A continuous operator reverse for the operator A can be built in this way: since Δt ∈ A ′ (F ′) ⊂ e ′, t ∈ K, there is a weak solution GT ′ A equation A′GT = ΔT, as a result of which equality is fair 136
