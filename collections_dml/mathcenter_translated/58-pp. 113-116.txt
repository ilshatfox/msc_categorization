A numerical study of the localization of deformation with the slow movement of the bulk environment O.I. Kuzovatova1 1 oik17@yandex.ru; The Siberian Federal University using the computing algorithm based on the finite elements method conducts numerical calculations of the task of moving the loose environment in a converging channel, which confirm the presence of zones of localization of deformations. Keywords: variational inequality, diverse environment, localization of deformations, the method of final elements, the initial stress method many natural and artificial materials have significantly different strengths of stretching and compression. To describe the stressed state of the bulk environment as a variety of material, a medium with plastic ties is used. Under the influence of compressive or stretching stresses, smaller clutch coefficients, such an environment is not deformed. As the limit of strength reaches, the deformation develops in accordance with the theory of linear hardening. The rheological diagram of the model is presented in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. The rheological scheme is judging by this scheme, a fairly additive representation σ = σc +σ0 +σe, here σ is a tensor of full stresses, σc the tensor of stresses in contact, σ0 - adhesion tensor, σe = e: ε is the tensor of elastic stresses, ε thousand - The tensor of deformations, E is a symmetrical positively defined tensor of elasticity modules. The tensor σc is subject to variational inequality κ is the dilatania parameter, γ (ε) = p 2ε ′: ε ′ - the intensity of the shift, ε ′ = ε- θδ/3 - the deformation deviator, θ (ε) = ε: δ - deformation of the volume, δ - the symbol of the crownker. Given the introduced designations, the inequality (1) takes the form (E: ε- --σ+σ0): (ε̃ --ε) ê 0, ε, ε̃ ∈C. According to the definition of projection, this means that ε = πc [e -1 (σ-σ0)], 114 “Lobachev readings - 2019” where π is a projection operator for a cone according to norm | ε | = p ε: e: ε. Consider the structure of the structure made of heterogeneous material, which occupies the flat area of ​​theω with the border ∂ω = γ, consisting of two non -overturning parts γu and γσ, on the first of which there are no movements, and on the second, the vector of the distributed load p is set. The equilibrium equation in the variation form and the boundary conditions are fair: ∫ ω (∇ · σ+ f) (ũ −u) dω = 0, (2) u = ũ = 0 on γu, σ · n = p for γσ. (3) The task (2) - (3) is reduced to the task of the minimum min ũ∈UC J (ũ) = j (u), where j (u) = ∫ ω (1 2 ε: ε+ε: σ0 - f · u) dω - ∫ γσ p · udγ, uc = {u ∈ H 1 (ω) | u | γu = 0, ε (u) ∈C}. Direct calculation shows that j (u) = - max ũ ∈UC ũ ̸ ̸ ̸ = 0 [∫ ω (ε (ũ): σ0 - f · ũ) dω - ∫ γσ p · ũdγ] 2 + 2 ∫ ω ε (ũ ũ ũ ũ (ũ ũ ũ ũ ũ ũ ũ ũ ũ ũ ũ ũ ũ ũ ): E: ε (ũ) dω. From this it can be shown that the field of displacements is identical to zero, in the case and only the case, if ω ω (ε (ũ): σ0 - f · ũ) dω - ∫ γσ p · ũdγé 0, ∀ũ ∈UC. (4) The load (F, P) is called safe if U ≡ 0. Let p = 0, F = m · F 0, where M is the loading parameter. Then from (4) we get that the load will be safe when changing the parameter m from zero to the limit value (stock coefficient) m ∗ = min ũ ∈ ∈ ̸ ̸ ̸ ∫ ω ε (ũ): σ0dω [∫ ω f · ũdω] +. (5) This statement is the formulation of a kinematic theorem about the ultimate balance, known from the theory of plasticity. Consider the task of the flat course under the influence of our own weight of the bulk environment in the converging channel, α> β. It is assumed that in the case of 1 localization of the deformation of a simple shift with dilatance occurs in a narrow linear zone of thickness H, inclined at an angle wor (Fig. 2), and case 2 at an angle ψ (Fig. 3). O.I. Kuzovatova 115 Fig. 2. Case 1 Fig. 3. The case 2 coefficient of the reserve M ∗ in this task will be the smallest value of the values ​​of the coefficients M1 and M2, for each case, respectively. With sin accord with a thousand --cosαp ν2+1 formulas for the reserve coefficient (5) for cases 1 and case 2 take the type: m1 = 2τs κρg a 1 sinα 1 (νsinα --cosα), m2 = 2τs κρg a 1 sinβ - cosβ), here τs is the limit limit. The analysis showed that the inequality of M1 <m2 is true at β <α. Thus, the localization zone is directed at an angle ng = α --arcsin 1p ν2 +1 (6) and corresponds to Fig. 2. The computing algorithm is based on the finite-element approximation of the model. The algorithm leads the task of determining the field of movements in a multi -resistant environment to solving the sequence of static tasks of linear elasticity with initial stresses. With its help, maximum loads can only be defined as close as loads, the excess of which leads to intensive deformation of the material. As an initial approximation in the iteration process, the solution of the elastic problem is used. The idea of ​​the algorithm consists in replacing the determining equations with an iterative formula (n = 1.2.3,..) Σn = e: εn - 1 1+λ λ λ λ λ λ λ λ − 11 −σ0). Here λ = const ê 0, π is the projection operator on the cone k = {σ | τ (σ) ≤ κp (σ)} according to the norm | σ | 0 = p σ: e - 1: σ, which acts SL
