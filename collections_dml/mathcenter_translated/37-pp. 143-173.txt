-Dender curve built on the basis of canonical models in [1] Crush γ = {x (t), y (t), z (t)}, set parametrically by equations of the 3rd degree: x (t) = α0t3 + 3α1T2 + 3α2t + α3, y (t) = β0t3 + 3β1t2 + 3β2t + β3, z (t) = γ0t3 + 3γ1t2 + 3γ2t + γ3, t ∈ [0, 1]. These curves are called cubically parameterized curves. Also, the concept of a canonical model for a b-sized curve was introduced in [1]. Definition. The curve γ ′, the equations of which has the form: x ′ (t) = α′0t 3 + 3α′1t 2 + 3α′2t + α ′ 3, y ′ (t) = β′0t 3 + 3β′1t 2 + 3β ′ 2T + β ′ 3, z ′ (t) = γ′0t 3 + 3γ′1t 2 + 3γ′2t + γ ′ 3 where each of the forms x ′ (t), y ′ (t), z ′ (t ) It has a canonical look FI, I = 1 ′, 1, 2, 3 [1], we call the canonical model of the curve γ (i, j, k), I 6 = j 6 = k. The canonical model of the curve changes with a change in the direction of bypassing the points of the source array. In [1] it is shown that the canonical model of any spatial cubic parametric curve will lie in one of the six planes. 144 In the space there are 24 unexplored models [1] (that is, cases of type curves (i, j, k), where I 6 = J 6 = K), which are located in the corresponding planes. An analysis of the parametric equations of each model shows that the model is a cross section of the cylinder S plane. The guide cylinder S is a semicurrent parabol, and the forming parallel are parallel to one of the coordinate axes (depending on the type of model). We consider the composite curve generated by the array of two canonical models. We get a curve consisting of 5 links. We call L1 - the initial link, L5 is the final one. The analysis of the results shows that the connection of the 4th and 5th links is not smooth. This is due to the fact that the direction (order) of bypassing the points of the entire curve and the last link is opposite. To eliminate the non -owners, we will change the procedure for bypassing the points of the last link. We also note that when changing the direction of bypassing the entire composite curve, when instead of L1 we put L5 with the first link, and instead of L5 the L1 link, the general view of the composite curve does not change.

Struzhanov Ural State University, Institute of Machine Studies of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Stru@imach.uran.ru about the functions of a catastrophe with stretching with the power to consider a mechanical system that joints a joint stretching with twisting with twisting Highly elastic sample with the help of two elastic rods. The loading of the sample (hard, soft and mixed) occurs in a potential power field at constant temperature with an extremely low speed (quasistatically). In this case, in the sample there are a tensile voltage σ, tangent voltage τ, longitudinal deformation ε and shift deformation γ. Note that the stresses and deformations are interconnected by complete deforming diagrams, in other words, the stage of recovery is taken into account, which is responded to the area falling to zero. The potential function W, describing the mechanical system, has the form W = λ1 (u - ε) 2 2 + λ2 (ψ - γ) 2 - u∫ 0 pdu - ∫∫ 0 mdψ + ∫ κ σdε + τDγ. Here κ is the path of deformation. This function connects control parameters with state parameters. Note that the role of control parameters is played by forces or set movements, and the role of state parameters - internal movements or deformation. Since this task is static, the study of the functioning of the mechanical system is reduced to the study of the solutions of equation 146 of the equilibrium obtained by equalization of the zero of the Hamilton operator, which is applied to the potential function W: ∇W = 0. (1) note that the Hamilton operator is determined in the space of the state parameters , which, we will assume, is Euclidean. Equation (1) defines both stable and unstable critical points of the function W (system equilibrium). To determine the nature of the stability of equilibrium provisions, the signs of the own values ​​of the Hesse matrix (stability matrix) H (W) the potential function W, which is determined by the formula H (W) = = ∇∇W. In the case when the Matrix H (W) has a full rank (unreasonable), critical points of the function W are unpertured (fruit -and -fruited), otherwise - degenerated critical (non -naval) points. According to the Morse theorem in the vicinity of unpertured critical, the potential function can be through some smooth replacement to the canonical quadratic (fruit drink) form, and this form does not depend on the control parameters. In the case of degenerated critical points, according to the principle of splitting volume, a potential function in some surroundings
