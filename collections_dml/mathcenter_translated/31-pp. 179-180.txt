Yusupov Nizhny Novgorod State University, tty@list.ru Consider the smooth main stratification The final group ∆ on B. for all b ∈ B, δ ∈ ∆ denote b · δ = rδ (b) = R (b, δ). In the work [1], the open coating of the base B is named (₽, ∆)-cover, if there is an atlas A (u) and rδ (u) = u for all u ∈ U, Δ ∈ ∆. Determination 1. Let U - (₽, ∆) —Prolling the base B. Action Ru: P -1 (U) × ∆ → P -1 (U), U ∈ U, call the local raising of the action R, if it satisfies the conditions: (1) p °ruaper = rδ ° P for all δ ∈ ∆; (2) rueth (v · g ′) = rueth (v) g ′ for all v ∈ P - 1 (u), g ′ ∈ T K. In this case, the set r = {ru | u ∈ U} We will call the pseudo -indentation of R. Drying 1. Product Local Raising R U Act 180
