Filippov1 1 8888vadim@mail.ru; Saratov Socio-Economic Institute (branch) of REU named after G.V. Plekhanova, the theorems of the completeness of special multimodular spaces are proved for the previously introduced by the author of multi -mudular spaces. Keywords: multimodular spaces, generalized classes and spaces of an eagle, space Emp. The foundations of modular spaces are reflected in monographs [1] and [2]. In this work, a generalization of modular spaces (multimodular spaces) is considered, theorems of the completeness of some kind of spaces are given. For these spaces, the F -Norm is determined. Note that the generalized spaces and classes of Orlich, as well as LP classes are a special case of modular spaces. The works [3–5] discusses the system systems in some specific modular spaces. In [6], some results are announced in multi -module spaces. The articles [3, 7, 8] investigated the ranks of Fourier and Fury-haara in special modular spaces. The space E with the F -Norm (norm) will be called the F -space (B -space), if it is full. Determination 1. Say that the functionality is ρ: e → [0, φ), on the actual or complex vector space E, is called a pseudo -modular, if conditions are fulfilled for arbitrary x and y belonging: 1) ρ (0) = 0; 2) in the case when E is valid, ρ (−x) = ρ (x). If E is comprehensive, then for the LOS of the real T, we have ρ (ei t x) = ρ (x); 3) for α≥ 0 and β 14 and α+β = 1 ρ (αx+βy) ≤ ρ (x)+ρ (y). Suppose that EI, I = 1, N, - actual or complex vector spaces. Consider the many E N0 consisting of elements F = (F1, F2,., FN), where fi ∈ EI, I = 1, N. Let F, G ∈ E N0, L - Scalars' Field. We introduce in the set E N0 the sum of F + G and the work of the element F ∈ E N0 on the scAR of α ∈ L is either a rifling. It can be shown that the set of E N0 is a linear space. Let ρi, i = 1, n, pseudo -modules (modules [6]) in ei, i = 1, n, then ρ0 (f) = 1 n ∑n i = 1ρi (fi), f ∈ E N0 will be a pseudo -modular (module ) in E N0. Determination 2. If ρ0 pseudo -modular in E N0, then E Nρ = {F ∈ E N0: LIM λ → 0 ρ0 (λ f) = 0} is called multimodular space. IN AND. Filippov 377 Let ρ0 pseudomodular in E N0. Then functionality | F | ρ0 = 1 n n∑ i = 1 Inf {ε> 0: ρi (fi ε) ≤ ε} will be F -pseudonorm in E Nρ. Theorem 1. Let ρi pseudo -modular in EI, I = 1, N. If f ∈ E nρ and fk ∈ E nρ for k = 1.2.3. . ., then condition | fk - f | ρ0 → 0 for k → φ is equivalent to the condition ρ0 (α (fk - f)) → 0 with k → weather for any α> 0. If fk ∈ E nime for k = 1.2,3 ... , then {fk} is the sequence of koshi in the space of E Nρ relative to F -pseudonorm | · | Ρ0, and only when ρ0 (α (fk - FL)) → 0 with k → ∞, l → ∞ for each α> 0. Definition 3. Suppose that (ωi, σ, µi), i), i), i), i), i), i), i) = 1, n, measurable space, i.e. Ωi is a non-empty set, σ-σ-algebra of the subset from ωi and µi-a non-negative complete measure not equivalent to zero. We will say that the actual function ffic ising on ωi × {[0, φ)} belongs to class B, if it satisfies the following conditions: 1) ∈ (x, v) is ffic from a variable V ≥ 0 for each x ∈ ωi , i.e. It is a non -flowing, continuous function such that wor (x, 0) = 0, ∗ (x, v)> 0 for V> 0, ∗ → ∞ with v → urb. 2) wor (x, v) is a σ -measured function from x for all V ≥ 0. Let EI -the many truly significant (or integral) σ -reproach and final µi -respect for ωi with the equivalence of µi almost everywhere. Obviously, wor (x, fi (x)) is a σ-measured function from x for each fi (x) ∈ EI and ρi (fi (x)) = ´ ωi ∗ (x, | fi (x) |) dµi He is a module in EI. Determination 4. Let ∗i ∈ B, I = 1, N. Modular space eρi, ρi (fi (x)) = ´ ωi wor (x, | fi (x) |) dµi, consisting of many of those fi (x) ∈ EI for which´ ωi ∗ (x, α | fi ( x) |) dµi → 0, with α → +0, we call the generalized spaces of the eagle and we will denote, with n = 1, through ∗ ∗ (l, ω, σ, µ) (or briefly ∗ ∗ (l)). Modular space E Nρ, ρ0 (f (x)) = 1n ∑n i = 1ρi (fi (x)), consisting of many of all those f (x) ∈ E n0 for which 1n ∑n i = 1 ´ ωi ∈ (x, α | fi (x) |) dµi → 0, with α →+0, we will denote through ventral (l, ω, σ, µ) (or briefly ∗ n (l)). Determination 5. Let ∗i ∈ B, I = 1, N. The set of all those fi (x) ∈ EI, for which ´ ωi ∗ (x, | fi (x) |) dµi <و, we call, with n = 1, the generalized class of the orlich and we will denote gment (l, ω, σ, σ, µ) (or briefly ∗ (l)). The set of all those F (x) ∈ E N0 for which ρ0 (F (x)) = 1 n n∑ i = 1 ˆ ωi ∗ (x, | fi (x) |) dµi <mm, we will denote through wor (l, Ω, σ, µ) (or briefly wor (l)). 378 Materials of the International School-Conference Determination 6. Function f (x) ∈ E N0 is called a limited element B vent (l), if α f (x) lus (l) for any α> 0. The set of all limited elements in uction ∗ n (l) are denoted by E N accord (pr
