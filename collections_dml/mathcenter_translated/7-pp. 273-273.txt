. Lavrentieva of the flow of bodies by the ideal liquid of M.M. Alnmov, A.B. Mazo Nii Mathematics and mechanics named after N.G. Chebotareva [(Azan State University 420008, Kazan, University St., 17 mars.alitov@k.si.ri, atazo@i.ri in monographs [1] A scheme of the flow of ideal liquid stu with the formation of non -relevant zones, and The mathematical setting of the relevant task is given. In the monograph [2], this task is reduced to the integral equation in the field with unknown borders, the results of the ERO solution for some typical tasks are given: symmetrical about the tacing of the plate, cylinder and ledge. Using modern computing means of the process of setting out models of mods to be solved Directly in the production [1], which was done by the authors. In this case, the results obtained significantly differ from those given in [2]. Famous experiments show that in the range of changes in the number of Reynolds: 1 about <45, there is a hundred zionic trace behind the cylinder. The scheme of M.A. Lavrentiev is closed by another parameter: the size of twisted in the trace. Her task is definitely CHMO determines the point of disruption of the stream, the size of the swirling zone, as well as the size of the flow circulation along its border. Therefore, comparing the solution of the problem according to the scheme of M.A. Lavrentiev with the experiment or with the decision of the Nastye-Koksa corresponding to the cottage, it is possible to establish the dependence of the size of the twistedly on Re. The application of this approach to the task of the qi flowing out. 1Indra gave a good compliance of the results in the indicated range of changes in the number of Reynolds. The work was carried out with financial support from the RFFIF (project No. 98-01 00200). Literature 1. Lavrentiev M.A â€œShabat B.V.
