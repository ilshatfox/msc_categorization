The splasen metodes of the solution of the fractional-integrated equation are considered equations with the selected weakness of the fractional integral of the Weil {21 g: = x (t) + iia> (x, t) + JO H (t, t) x (t) dt = J (t), (1) where x (t) is the desired function, if) (x, t) - a fractional integral of Weil from function x (t) (see, for example, [1]), f (t) and h (t, t) known 27g-periodic functions. Since the equation (1) is definitely not solved, for its reinforcement, it is necessary to develop various close associates of me. Below, the problem (1) is solved by the method of splashing collocations (see, for example, [2]) based on first-order slaves. We introduce a mesh of nodes (2) the approximate solution of the equation (1) we will look for in the form of 27g -periodic splan XN (t) = 2 ::. :: cxkcpk (t), -o <t <00, (3) k = -n IS HE . Grigoryeva 99 where 'pk (t) is fundamental slats of the first degree from the node (2). Unknown coefficients A0, A1 ,. . . AN determine from conditions (4) it is clear that the conditions (4) are a system of neural algebraic equations relative to the coefficient O: k · theorem.
