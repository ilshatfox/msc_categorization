. Dual regulatory in the reverse task for the abstract parabolic equation F. A. KUTERIN Nizhny Novgorod State University named after N.I. Lobachevsky, Xredor@yandex.ru in [1] proposed a regulatory version of the algo of the rhythm of Udzava to solve the problem of optimal management. This work continues research in this direction for an abstract parabolic equation. Let h - the Hilbert space, u1, u2 ⊂ h - convex closed sets, d ≡ ≡ {u ∈ L2 (0, t; h): u (t) ∈ U1 for p. t ∈ [0, T]} × {V ∈ H: V ∈ U2} - a lot of permissible controls. The inverse task is considered to find the minimum in terms of the norm of the element π = (u, v) ∈ D by the observation of y (t) ∈ H for the 146 abstract task of the Koshi y ′ (t) +ay (t) = u (t) +ay (t) = u (t) +ay (t). t), 0 6 t 6 t; y (0) = v. (1) The task is reformulated in the form of an equivalent task of the option of the type of equality, then the unconditional maximization of the functionality of the functionality of Raf, α (λ) = v δ (λ) - α λ || 2, λ ∈ H, is carried out. where v δ (λ) = min πefed (‖π‖2 + 〈λ, y [π] (t) - qδ〉), qδ is approximately known observation, ‖qδ - y (t) ‖ <δ, a The solution to the problem (1) is understood in the generalized sense [2]. Let λδ, α - the only point in H, which gives the maximum functionality Rith, α (λ). Subject to coordination of the error of the initial data problem Δ with the regulator parameter α, i.e., when performing the maximum ratio Δ/α (δ) → 0 with Δ → 0, regulatory elements πδ [λδ, α] are strongly converged to solving the initial problem π0 Regardless of whether it reaches the functionality V 0 maximum on h or not. An iterative diagram is given for the described algorithm. Illustrative examples are considered. The author expresses gratitude to the scientific leader, professor M.I.

Lobachevsky, laddassm@hotmail.com due to the problem of classifying simple algebrics or low characteristics is of interest to study from the messenger series of exceptional simple algebrus Li. The work considers filtered deformations of al Goebr Lee of the Franc T (M) characteristics 3, the geometric implementation of which is built in the works [1] - [3] (see also [6]). Filtered algebra L Lee L is called filtered deformation of the graduated algebra L Lee if GRL = L. There are several approaches to the description of filtered de formations. In the work, a method based on the theorem of the filtered algebrus of the contact type in the ultimate algebra Lee obtained in the work [5] and the technique of description of deformations developed there were applied. The investment t = t (m) was also used in the contact algebra k = k (3: 1, 1, m), according to Brown [4]. According to [5] local filtered 148
