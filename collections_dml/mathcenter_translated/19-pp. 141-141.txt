) The regional tasks for the Helmholtz equation in areas with an endless Lipshitsky border conducted a study of the regional tasks of the conductor; ~ e and Neum on the Helmholtz equation with the final inclusion, the geometry of which is described by the Lipshitsky howl (definitions see, e.g., in [1] ). The approach used earlier in solving the tasks of the diffraction of electromagnetic waves on endless obstacle to the yach with the final piece-clad inclusion (see [2, s]). The study is carried out in generalized Sobolevsky transactions with an additional condition on the function, which is the option of the condition of Zommerfeld. For the case of lipschita boundaries, a significant processing of the research scheme developed for the piece of curve-barking was required. With evidence, the uniqueness of the decision used the analogue of the formulas of Green (see, e.g., [1, 4]). Operators were also introduced, called with [4] operators such as potential and reckoning an ANA, 1 -and -and -haul used in the work [2, 3] of generalized potentials of simple and double layers. Proof of resolution of the region L; Shark is based on the study of the properties of these operators. Literature 1. Mitrea M.
