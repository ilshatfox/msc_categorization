Materials of the International School-Conference in the case of 1 ≤ P <2 Theorem 1 argues that if the values ​​εn, δ, h are quite small, then all the stationary points of the task (3), (4) lying in the BN ball (U ∗; m, L) = {u ∈hn: ∥u −u ∗ ∥h1 ≤ 1 m (m2/p 2l) p/(2 --p)}, are actually from U ∗ at a distance of order O ((εn +δ +h2) 1/p). Thus, with small εn, δ, h, the possible multi -ethnicity of the problem (3), (4) is insignificant if it limits the specified ball. In particular, any stationary maximum point from BN (U ∗; M, L), generated by the arbitrary iteration process of final minimization, serves as a good approximation for U ∗. In the case of P = 2, when fulfilling the condition L/M <1, additional restrictions on U ∗ N are not, i.e. You can put BN (u ∗; m, l) = Hn. The work was carried out with the financial support of the Russian Federation (project 16–01–00039A), supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation as part of a state assignment (project 1.5420.2017/8.9).

UDC 517.983.54 assessments of the speed of convergence of variable schemes for incorrect tasks of the cat's first and second orders M.M. Kokurin1 1 kokurin@next@mail.ru; Marisky State University, Faculty of Physics and Mathematics establishes sedate assessments of the speed of convergence of different methods for solving incorrect tasks of the first and second order in the guilbert space. For these assessments, the necessary and sufficient conditions close to each other were found in terms of the indicator of the source of the desired decision. Keywords: the incorrect task of the Koshi, the Hilbert space, the variable scheme, the speed of convergence. The incorrect tasks of Koshi for differential -operator equations of the first and second order are studied: ẋ (t) = AX (t), t ∈ [0, T]; x (0) = f ∈ D (A); (1) M.M. Kokurin 197 ẍ (t) = AX (t), t ∈ [0, T]; X (0) = F ∈ D (A), ẋ (0) = 0. (2) here A: H → H - an unlimited, densely defined, self -combined linear operator in the calbert space H with a spectrum σ (a) ∈ [A ,+Urb), a> 0. For each of the tasks (1), (2), the question is raised about the discrete approximation of the classical solution X: [0, t] → H on the segment [0, T]; The existence of this decision is assumed. It is known that both tasks cannot have more than one classic solution. For approximation of the solution of the problem (1), a class of single -step different circuits with the parameter β> 0 is built, which have the order of approximation m = 1: - xn+xn+1 = ∆t a ((1+β) xn βxn+1), 0 ≤ n ≤ n −1, x0 = f. (3) In addition, a class of two -step variable schemes with parameters β1 ∈ (0.1), β2> 0 for the task (1) that have the order of approximation m = 2: (1–2β1) xn + (2β1 −2) xn is studied +1 +xn +2 = ∆t a ((β1 –β2 −1) xn + +(β1 +2β2 +1) xn +1 –β2xn +2), 0 ≤ n ≤ n −2, x0 = f, x1 = 2 F - (E +∆T A) −1 F. (4) For the approximation of the solution of the problem (2), a class of two -step variable schemes with the parameter β> 0 is proposed, which have the order of approximation m = 2: xn −2xn +1 +xn +2 = (∆t) 2 a (βxn +(1 +2β) xn+1 –βxn+2), 0 ≤ n ≤ n −2, x0 = f, x1 = 3 2 f - 1 2 (e+(∆t) 2 a) −1 f. (5) In the formulas (3) - (5) ∆t = t /n is a step of sampling, xn ∈ H - approximation to the value X (n∆t) of the desired function X (t) in the N -m node of samples, e - Single operator in h. If x (t) is a classic solution to the problem (1) or (2), then the element X (t) allows the source -like representation X (t) = a -p W with some p ≥ 1, w ∈ H. The following theorems set the degree assessments of the rate of convergence of the schemes (3) - (5), depending on the indicator of the source of the corresponding decision. Theorem 1. For diverse schemes (3) of the solution of the problem (1) there is an assessment of the speed ∥xn −x (n∆t) ∥ ≤ {c1 (∆t) p/2, 1 ≤ p <2 c1∆t, p. ≥ 2}, 0 ≤ n ≤ n, c1 = c1 (p). Theorem 2. For diverse schemes (4) of the solution of the problem (1), the valuation of the ∥xn −x (n∆t) ∥ ≤ {c2 (∆t) 2p/3, 1 ≤ p <3 c2 (∆t) 2 is true. , p ≥ 3}, 0 ≤ n ≤ n, c2 = c2 (p). Theorem 3. For diverse schemes (5) of the solution of the problem (2), there is an assessment of the speed ∥xn −x (n∆t) ∥ ≤ {c3 (∆t) 4p/3, 1 ≤ p <3/2 c3 (∆t) t) 2, p ≥ 3/2}, 0 ≤ n ≤ n, c3 = c3 (p). 198 Materials of the International School-Conference of Theorem 1-3 belong to the case when the input data f is known for sure. When studying incorrect tasks, the case is more relevant when instead of element F, its approximation Fδ, ∥ fδ - f ∥ ≤ δ. In this case, the number of segments of crushing N B (3) - (5) should be selected depending on Δ. Theorem 4. For diverse schemes (3) - (5) in conditions of approximate input data with a suitable choice of dependence n (Δ), the assessment ∥xn −x (n∆t) ∥ is fair
