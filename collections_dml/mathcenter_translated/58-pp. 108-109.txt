"Lobachev readings - 2019" UDC 517.518 The exponential type of a whole function with one A.F. Kuzhaev1 1 arsenkuzh@outlook.com; Bashkir State University, Ufa State Oil Technical University in the work gives a lower assessment to the exponential type of whole function with 1 (such functions are also called entire functions of the exponential type). This assessment was made through the logarithmic block of sequence of zeros of this whole function. It is assumed that zeros are material. Key words: a whole function, order of a whole function, type of whole function, zeros of a whole function, logarithmic block-compliance, let F-a whole function. Recall (see [1, p. 8-9]) that the order of the whole function is the following value ρ (f) = lim r → φ lnln m (f, r) lnr, m (f, r) = max | z | = R | f (z) |. The type of this function in order ρ is the value σ (f) = lim r → φ ln m (f, r) r ρ if one of the two conditions are fulfilled for the whole function: either ρ <1, or ρ = 1, but type σ final , then they say that this is a whole function of the exponential type. Equivalent definition: a whole function is a whole function of the exponential type, if in the entire complex plane it satisfies the inequality of LN | f (z) | É a | z |+b, z ∈C. Consider the sequence of zeros λ (f) = {λk} ger = 1 of the whole function F, which is numbered by non -modules. Some numbers in the sequence can be repeated, but the number of repetitions of each point of course. If the function F is not identical zero, then the sequence λ (f) is not limited in the module, or empty (provided that F is not polynomial). In this work, we will assume that all the numbers λk are material. Let A = {AK} inous = 1 - an unlimited sequence on a material line. Recall (see [2]) that the Logarithmic block of the positive sequence is called the following value L̄ (A) = Inf U> 1 Lim T → ∞ T <Akéut 1 AK, where each component in the amount of counts is exactly as many times, what The multiplicity of the point AK in the sequence A. According to the lemma 3.2 of the work [3] the logarithmic block-density can be calculated differently: l̄ (a) = lim u → ° Limt → nder ∑ t <akéut 1 ak, A.F. Kuzhaev 109 That is, the limit for U → ∞ always exists. According to Lyndelef (see [1, p. 35]) and Lemme 1 of the work [4], for the whole function of the exponential type, the logarithmic block of its zeros is always finite. The following result is fair. Theorem. Let F - a whole function of the exponential type, and let σ - its exponential type. Let the further λ (f) = {λk} φk = 1-the sequence of zeros of the function f, l̄ (λ (f))-the logarithmic blockness of this sequence. Then the following assessment σ (f) êπl̄ (λ (f)) is fair.
