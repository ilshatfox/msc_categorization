. Anode shapes when cutting with asymmetric trihedral cathode K.Sh. MA1SHUR Kazan State University by hydrodynamic an.Ru1 Â· OM finding the anode border from the messenger characteristics of the tool (the width is equal to the side of the side faces - p and y) is the task of determining the border by the current AB (Fig. 1) with the specified year FOM FOM speeds and boundary conditions: v; = l on ADC; VF-0, D 1 /// DP = COS () on A R. When solving the problem, as in [1], an ANNA of the theory of the functions of a complex alternating (conformal display, the formula of Christophfle Schwartz) was used. As a result, an algorithm for calculating anode; The numerical calculations for various angles of p and different dl1m b. In the symmetrical case, comparisons are given with the results of the TAMs of other authors. Literature 1. Karimov A.Kh "Klokov V.V" Filatov e. AND .
