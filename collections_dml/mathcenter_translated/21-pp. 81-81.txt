Geometric connectedness in the extension of the centered planes of O. O. Belov Ka. Lipiprad State University, Olesya@epc. Albertina. RU in the N-dimensional projective space considers the space V of all centered planes of dimension M. Space V is presented in the form of two homogeneous strata: 1. S (RP) - the stratification of the ligaments of the s M -dimensional planes of the projective space passing through one point (the base is the area of ​​the projective space of the RP, and the typical layer - the bunch of S); 2. T (v) - stratification of the aggregates of the centered M -fluids belonging to one unconventional plane LM (the base is the diversity of the grassman GR (M, P) of the plane LSCH, and the typical layer is the totality of T). In each of the homogeneous stratification, the linear Diffe Rensky-Goeome will be defended; AND . Bluezasas. Prove that the equipment of the space with the fields of the planes of the RP-T and PM-L (the plane P711 _ 1 l • the life in the plane of LRN and does not pass through its center A, the plane PN-M 11erssekas1'sy with, at point A), which are with ~ 1 analogues of the rammey of the 1st and 2nd genus in the sense of Norden, allow us to set these connectedness. The components of the objects of geometric connectedities have been built by the KVA components: zitenzors of the equipment of the space of space V in each E1 · 0 representations. With the help of a pair. 11 of the rensions, a characteristic of the connectednesses induced by the fields of the equipping planes is given. For each stratification, the values ​​of the object of curvature of geometric connectedness in constructed coverage are located. It is shown that the curvature is either zero or tensor appearance. 81
