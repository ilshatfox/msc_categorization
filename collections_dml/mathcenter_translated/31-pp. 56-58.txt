The existence of a generalized solution of the non -valve problem for the wave equation V. B. Dmitriev Samara Academy of Railways Consider the equation LU ≡ UTT −4U = F (X, T) (1) 56 in the cylinder Qt = {(x, τ): x ∈ ω ⊂ rn, 0 <τ <t}, where ω is a limited area in RN with a smooth boundary. We set for him the task with the initial conditions of the Cossack u (x, 0) = onic (x), (2) Ut (x, 0) = ψ (x) (3) and non -cabinal condition ∂u ∂n | ST = ∫ ω K (x, y) u (y, t) dy, (4) where ∗ (x), ψ (x), k (x, y) are set, and st = {(x, t): x ∈ ∂ω, 0 <t <t} - the side surface of the cylinder Qt. The definition of a generalized decision is based on the identity of t∫ 0 ∫ ω (cheTvt +∇u∇v) dx dx dx 0 ∫ω v (x, t) ∫ ω k (x, y) u (y, t) Dy ds dt = t∫ 0 ∫ ω f (x, t) v (x, t) dx dt + ∫ ω ψ (x) v (x, 0) dx. (5) definition. We will call a generalized solution from W 12 (Qt) of the problem (1) - (4) the function u (x, t) belonging to W 12 (Qt) equal to wor (x) with t = 0 and satisfying identity (5) for any v ∈ W 12 (Qt), V (X, T) = 0. Theorem. The task (1) - (4) has a generalized solution from W 12 (qt) for f ∈ L2.1 (qt), onic w 12 (ω), k ∈ L2 (ω × ω) and ψ ∈ L2 (ω) When fulfilling the conditions | k (x, y) | ≤ r (y) ∀x ∈ ω, where ∫ ω r2 (y) dy = r <mm. Proof. We will use the Galerkin method. Let {∗}} is the fundamental orthonomated system in 57 W 12 (ω): (∗, lus) = ∫ ω ∗ fficuns puldx = ΔLK. The approximate solution u n (x, t) is looking for in the form of un = n∑ k = 1 cNK (t) onic (x) from the ratios (Untt, lus) + ∫ ω n∑ i = 1 unxiphise - ∫ ∂ω ∗ Ω k (x, y) un (y, t) dy ds = = (f, uction), l = 1, 2 ,. . . , N. (6) System (6) - a system of normal linear ordinary differential equations of the second order by T relatively unknown CNK (t), k = 1 ,. . . , N (with constant coefficients). The initial conditions here are unambiguously determined by conditions (2) and (3). With them, the system (6) ∀n is unambiguously resolved (see [2], p. 27), and d2cnk /dt 2 ∈ L2 (0, t). By constructing a sequence {un} inous = 1, we will prove its convergence. It can be shown that the constructed sequence is limited: ‖un‖w 12 (qt) ≤ c (7) thanks to (7) from the sequence {un}, n = 1, 2,. . . , you can choose sub -sequence (for which we will preserve the same designation), which is weak in W 12 (Qt) and evenly by t ∈ [0, t] in normal l2 (ω) to a certain element U ∈ W 12 (qt) ([1 ], p. 214). This is U (x, t) and there is a generalized solution to the problem (1) - (4). L and T R A T R A 1. Ladyzhenskaya O. A. Regional tasks of mathematical fi siki. - M.: Nauka, 1973. - 408 p. 2.
