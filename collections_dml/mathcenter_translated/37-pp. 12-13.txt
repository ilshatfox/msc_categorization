The study of the stress-deformed state of three-dimensional MKE structures is considered a homogeneous isotropic concrete beam. On the ribs of the beam are steel reinforcements. Along steel reinforcements, stretching forces act. The stresses and deformations of the concrete beam are sought. In the general case, the task boils down to the search for such a vector of displacements {v}, in which a minimum of energy function l = 1 2 ∫∫ v ∫ {ε} t [d] dv - ∫∫ v ∫ {q} t {v {v {v {v {v {v {v {v {v {v } DV - ∫ s ∫ {p} t {v} DV, where {ε} is the vector of deformations, {v} - vector of movements, {q} - vector of mass forces, {p} - vector of surface forces, [d] - - The matrix of elastic constant. For a numerical solution, the initial structure is divided into an arbitrary number of finite elements. As the final element, a three -dimensional final element of the isprametric type and the second degree of approximation was selected. For a separate final element, an expression of energy functionality is built as a function of moving nodes belonging only to this final element LM = 1 2 {QM} T [km] {qm} - {pm} t {qm}, 13 where {qm} is the vector of nodal movements element, [km] - matrix of the stiffness of the element. The energy functionality of the whole body is built as the sum of energy values ​​for all elements. It is believed that the movements of the nodes belonging to different elements are the same for all adjacent elements. L and T R A T R A 1. Golovanov A.N., Berezhnaya D.V.
