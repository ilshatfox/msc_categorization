-AVERAGED CHARACTERISTIC U.K. Asanbekov, A.N. Malyutina  In the present paper we give examples showing that, in contrast to mappings with bounded distortion, for mappings with s-averaged characteristic, for which the integrals are bounded, the boundedness of the multiplicity and the degree on compact sets in D, in general , does not hold.

Astashkin1 1 Astash56@mail.ru; Samara National Research University named after S.P. The queen says that the banakh space X has the property of Kato, if each linear is a strictly singular operator acting in X, compact. Clarifying some recent results, we prove that this property has a wide class 2-dizly uniform symmetrical spaces. Keywords: symmetrical space, compact operator, strictly sigular operator, 2-dizly uniform banquic grate. Recall that the linear operator, limited from one banahov space to another, is called strictly singular, if no narrowing on endless subspace is isomorphism. This concept was introduced by T. Kato in connection with the solution of some problems of the theory of disturbances of Fredgolm operators [1]. How easy it is to see, many strictly singular operators form a closed operator ideal that contains the ideal of compact operators. At the same time, according to the classical theorem of J. Kalkin [2] the latter is the only non -trivial closed ideal of operators limited in the Hilbert space. Therefore, in this case, the ideals of strictly singular and compact operators coincide [1]. A similar result is also true for LP spaces, 1 ≤ p <و, and C0 [3], and, as it was recently proved in [4], for some class 2-dizly uniform symmetrical spaces. We will say that the banakh space X has the property of Kato, if each linear strictly Singolar operator acting in X is compact in this space. Recall also that Banakhov’s grate X is called 2-dizywnly homogeneous, if any sequence of pair of disjunctic normalized elements in X contains subsequentness, equivalent to the canonical basis in L2. 52 Materials of the International School-Conference of Theorem 1 [4]. Let the X-2-dizly uniform symmetrical space on [0.1] that x ⊃ lp at some p <mm. Then each strictly singular operator acting in X, compact. The purpose of this note is to spread the theorem 1 to a wider class of 2-dizly uniform symmetrical spaces. Recall some definitions from the theory of symmetrical spaces (see more complete information in [5]). Banahov’s space X measurable on [0.1] functions is called symmetrical (or double-personal), if 1) it is perfect, i.e. From inequality | X (t) | É | y (t) | For P.V. t ∈ [0.1], where function X is measured by the Lebeg, and y ∈ X, follows x ∈ X and ∥x∥x éy∥x; 2) from the equal measurability of the functions x and y ∈ X, i.e. equality µ ({t ∈ [0.1]: | y (t) |> u}) = µ ({t ∈ [0.1]: | x (t) |> u}), u> 0, where µ (e) - the measure of the logs of the set E ⊂R, the X ∈ X and ∥x∥x = ∥y∥x stems. In particular, any measurement of [0.1] function X is equal to proper with its non -growing continuous rearrangement x ∗ (t): = Inf {u ≥ 0: µ ({s ∈ [0,1]: | x (s) | > u}) <t}, 0 <t ≤ 1. For each SP X on [0.1] Continuous investments are true: lip ⊂ x ⊂ l1. An important and most famous example of symmetrical spaces is LP space, 1 ≤ P ≤ear, with the usual norm. Their natural generalization is the spaces of Orlich. Let m (t) - an increasing convex function on [0, φ), m (0) = 0. The space of the LM eagle consists of all measurable to [0.1] functions X, such that the norm is ∥x∥lm: = Inf {U> 0: ˆ 1 0 m (| x (s) | u) d s ≤ 1} finite. In particular, if m (t) = t p, 1 ≤ p <mm, we get LP space. The closure of the Linger in the spaces of the Orlich, built according to the function M (t) = E T 2 −1, is usually indicated through G. It is well known (see [6] or [7, Lemma 3.2]) that x ∈G, if only if lim t → 0 x ∗ (t) ln1/2 (e/t) = 0. From the last ratio, In particular, it is easy to see that g ̸ = ⊂ lp for each p <mm. Therefore, the following statement is an increase in the theorem 1. Theorem 2. Let X-2-diz-uniform symmetrical space on [0.1], x ⊃g. Then each strictly singular operator acting in X, compact. Proof. Let the linear operator t: x → x strictly singular. Since the space x 2-dizly, in view of [4, Lemma 2.10], it is enough to show that the set of T ([−x, x]), where [−x, x]: = {y ∈ X: | Y | ≤ x}, relatively compact in x for each x ∈ X, x ≥ 0. S.V. Astashkin 53 If T is not compact, then there are x ∈ X, X ≥ 0, and the sequence {gn} from the serial interval [−x, x] such that the sequence {t gn} does not contain fundamental in the X subsequent.
