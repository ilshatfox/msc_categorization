) The equivalence of the norms of analytical functions in the appearance of the convex region, let D is a limited convex region on a complex plane and G = C \ D. Through D (ζ), ζ ∈ G, we denote the distance from the point ζ to the border D: D (ζ) = DIST (ζ, ∂D) = Inf zlex | ζ - z |, ζ ∈ G. Let H0 ( G) - the space of functions that analytical in G and disappearing in infinite. For α> −1/2 through Bα2 (G), we denote the space consisting of the functions γ ∈ H0 (G), for which the norm is finite ‖γ‖α =  ∫ g | γ (ζ) | 2D2α (ζ) DV (ζ) DV (ζ) DV (ζ) DV (ζ) DV ( ζ)   1/2, where DV (ζ) is an element of the area. For α = −1/2, the space Bα2 (G) will identify with the space of Smirnov. Considering without loss of community that 0 ∈ D, Smirnov’s space E2 (G) can be defined as a replenishment of space (see [1]) {P (ζ) - Polin: P (0) = 0, ∫g | P (1 /ζ) | 2 ds (ζ) <least}, where DS (ζ) is an element of the length of the border arc. We introduce the natural number N and through b (n, α) 2 (G) denote the space of functions γ ∈ H0 (G), for which γ (n) ∈ Bα2 (G). In space b (n, α) 2 (g) the norm is ‖γ‖n, α = ‖ (n) ‖α. The main result of this work is the following theorem 1. If α> −1/2, then there is such a constant C (n, α)> 0, which does not depend on the region D, which is √ (α + 1) (2α + 1) 2 ‖ γ‖n, α 6 ‖γ‖n+1, α+1 6 c (n, α) ‖γ‖n, α. For α = −1/2, there is such a constant C (n, −1/2)> 0, depending on the area D, which (1/2) ‖γ‖n, −1/2 6 ‖γ‖n+1, 1/2 6 C (N, −1/2) ‖γ‖, −1/2. Thus, the spaces B (n+1, α+1) 2 (G) and b (N, α) 2 (G) coincide and the norms in them are equivalent. 39 In particular cases, this theorem is proved in the works [2], [3]. We first prove several lemmas. Lemma 1. with any n and α> −1/2, the subspace of space b (n, α) 2 (G), consisting of functions, analytical on G, is everywhere tight in b (n, α) 2 (G). Proof. For Smirnov’s space (case α = −1/2) this follows from the definition of space. If γ ∈ B (n, α) 2 (G), where α> −1/2, then take the sequence of TM numbers that decrease to 1 at m → °, and consider the functions γM (ζ) = t −2n m γ ( tmζ), ζ ∈ G (we believe that 0 ∈ D). Obviously, γm (ζ) ∈ H0 (g) and ∫ g | γ (n) m (ζ) | 2D2α (ζ) dV (ζ) = ∫ g | γ (n) (tmζ) | 2D2α (ζ) DV DV (ζ). Let's replace the variables TMζ = Z. The varine Z runs the area gtm = tmg ⊂ g, and, obviously, D (Z/TM) 6 D (Z)/TM. Therefore, ‖γm‖2n, α 6 t - 2–2αm ∫ gtm | γ (n) (z) | 2D2α (Z) DV (Z). Since 2 + 2α> 1, then ‖γm‖2n, α 6 ∫ g | γ (n) (z) | 2D2α (Z) DV (z) = ‖γ‖2n, α. In addition, it is obvious that γm evenly on the compacts from G contensing to γ. From these facts in a standard way we get that γm → γ is normal in space b (n, α) 2 (G). Lemma 1 proven. It allows you to prove the theorem 1 and subsequent lemmas only for the functions in G. Lemma 2. 1) the function of the distance D (ζ) convex (in particular, subharmonic) and satisfies the condition of the lips | D (ζ1) - D (ζ2) | 6 | ζ1 - ζ2 | ∀ζ1, ζ2 ∈ G; 2) if D (ζ) is differentiated at point ζ0, then | grad d (ζ0) | = 1; 3) If D is a convex polygon, then D (ζ) is continuously differentiated in G. Providence. 1) through b (z, r), r> 0, we will designate the circle with the center at the point Z and the radius r. Let ζ0 ∈ G and 3D0 = DIST (ζ0, ∂D). Consider the family of direct {lα}, separating the region D from the circle b (ζ0, d0), and let {pα} 40 - the corresponding family of half -fluidity containing D. Then it is obvious that for ζ ∈ B (ζ0, d0) Dist (ζ, ∂D) = SUP α DIST (ζ, pα). Since Dist (ζ, pα) is a linear function, d (ζ) = DIST (ζ, ∂D) is a convex function. Let ζ1, ζ2 ∈ G and Z2 ∈ ∂D - the point of achieving distance D (ζ2), that is, D (ζ2) = | z2 - ζ2 |. Then D (ζ1) - D (ζ2) = Inf zlex | z - ζ1 | - | z2 - ζ2 | 6 | z2 - ζ1 | - | z2 - ζ2 | 6 | ζ1 - ζ2 |. Since ζ1, ζ2 - equal, then | D (ζ1) - D (ζ2) | 6 | ζ1 - ζ2 |. 2) according to the derivatives d (ζ) in paragraphs in paragraphs, do not exceed in modulus 1. If Z0 ∈ ∂D is the point of achieving distance D (ζ0), then the derivative of D (ζ) in the direction (ζ0- Z0)/| ζ0 - z0 | At point ζ0 is equal to one. Since the gradient module is equal to the maximum module of derivatives in directions, then | Grad D (ζ0) | = 1. 3) The addition to the convex polygon is divided into semi -breeds, in which the distance is reached on one of the sides of the polygon, and to the corners with the vertices in one of the vertices of the polygon. In these corners, the distance is achieved at the corresponding top of the polygon. Obviously, the function of the distance is continuously differentiated in the insides of the stripes and angles. It remains to check continuous differentiation on the boundary rays. One of these rays is compatible with a positive part of the ordinate axis so that one of the sides of the polygon lay on the positive part of the abscissa axis. Let ζ0 = IY0, Y0> 0. To the left of ζ0 distance D (ζ) = | ζ |, right - D (ζ) = IM ζ. If ζ = x + iy, then on the left of ζ0 we have ∂ DIST (ζ, D)/∂X = x/| ζ |, ∂ DIST (ζ, D)/∂Y = Y/| ζ |, and we get ∂ DIST (ζ, D)/∂X ≡ 0, ∂ DIST (ζ, D)/∂Y ≡ 1. Thus, the first private derivatives on the positive semi -shafts of the ordinates are “glued”. Lemma 2 proven. We prove the right -wing theorem inequality for α> −1/2. We will use the theorem of continuation of the type of Whitney (see [4]).
