. Homomorphism of claws de Rama, induced by a complete elevator of differential forms 176 into the stratification of Weil V.V. Shurygin (ml.) Kazan State University, vadimjr@ksu.ru Let a - algebra Weil. We denote the symbol of MF the category of smooth diversity, and the symbol of the FM is the category of stubborn spaces. The algebra A associate the TA: Mf → FM function, called the Veil function, which relates to the smooth diversity m its stratification of Weil πa: Tam → M [1]. We will assume that algebra A is Frobenius, i.e., an unexplored bilinear form Q: A × A → R is set to the following associative condition: Q (XY, Z) = Q (X, Y Z) for any X, Y, Y, Y Z ∈ A. Form Q determines the Frobenius Coicator P: a → R by formula p (x) = q (x, 1a), where 1a is a unit of algebra A. Let L - an endless module above a and t: l ×. . . × l → a-a-digit covariant tensor. Definition [2]. The implementation of the tensor T is called the material tensor R (t): = p ° t: l ×. . . × l → R. Let M-M-Merged smooth diversity. The stratification of Weil TAM is a M-dimensional A-grinding diversity, and at each point X ∈ TAM the tangent space of TXTAM is an M-dimensional A-module [2, 3]. Let ă ∈ ω ∗ (m) - the differential form on m and lection ∈ ising (TAM) - its analytical continuation [3]. Determination. Complete elevator hole of differential form ă will call the form lection: = R (hole) on TAM. Theorem 1. Let M - smooth diversity, tam - its stratification of Weil. Full elevator of external forms induces GO 177
