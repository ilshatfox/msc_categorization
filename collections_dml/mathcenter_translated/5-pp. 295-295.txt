Let (M, G) duality - compact oriented P -Mortal Rimano diversity, etc. (m, r) - vector space of conformal Kil; ~ inri R -forms (see [1]), then there is a theorem. DIM T '(m. R) = t, <oau t, = tp _, for r =- 1, 2, "., P-1. This fact established by us (2] only in the case of Rimanov only a variety of constant curvature , is an analogue of the well-known duality theorem of Poincare, = bp _,. For the numbers Betty, each of which serve as the dimension of the corresponding vector space n '(m, r) harmonic R-forms. We denote through (m, r) and p " - '(m, r) vector spaces of cosamed (killin) and closed (flat) conformities of the lingopian r- and (n - r) - form, respectively. Based on the isomomomer of these spaces (see {2]) and The above approval we formulate the investigation (see [2]). DIT to {m, r) = k, <oo and DIM RP- '(m, r) = RP-, <a:; for k, = RP-R . Literature 1.
