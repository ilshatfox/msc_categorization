UDC 517.53 Steam of harmonics from trigonometric polynomials with an amplitude-phase operator V.I. Danchenko1, D.Ya. Danchenko2 1 vdanch2012@yandex.ru; Vladimir State University named after A.G. and N.G. Stock 2 ddanchenko@vlsu.ru; Vladimir State University named after A.G. and N.G. Stocking rooms are proposed a method of excretion from trigonometric polynomials TN (t) of the sums of two harmonics with specified numbers by amplitude-phase transformations. Such transformations transform member (t) into similar ones, performing two simple operations - multiplication by the material constant X and a shift into the material phase λ, i.e. TN (t) 7 → x · tn (t −λ). Harmonics are distinguished by an amplitude-phase operator, which is the addition of such polynomials. Key words: amplitude-phase operator, harmonic evaluation. The action of the amplitude-phase operator (AF) is not higher than m on trigonometric polynomial tn (t) = a0 + n∑ k = 1 τk (t), τk (t): = ak coskt + bk sinkt, n purpose, 144 materials International School-Conference is as follows: tn (t) 7– → m∑ j = 1 x j · tn (t –λ j), x j, λ j ∈R. (1) In the works [1], [2] it is shown that for any number µhern 1, there is an AFO for which m∑ j = 1 x j · tn (t - λ j) = τµ (t)+a0 · m ∑ j = 1 x j, (2) where m = m (n, µ), a {x j}, {λ j} do not depend on TN, but depend only on n andµ. Thanks to the materiality of these parameters (2), it has a simple physical meaning: from the stationary signal TN (t), harmonica τµ (t) is distinguished by the application of no more than m such signals that differ only in amplitudes and initial phases. Harmonic highlighting signals (without the use of intermediate spectral measurements) allows you to effectively use the AFO for assessments of the harmonic of trigonometric polynons. Especially important for assessments is the construction of AFO, which has all the XK of one sign. With the help of such AFU in [1], [2], for example, accurate assessments of the LP-Norm harmonic through the LP-Norm of the polynomial itself were found, and in the case of non-negative polynomas TN ̸≡ 0, accurate assessments of their coefficients through a free member (generalization of Feyer inequality for the first harmonica; see [1]): √ a2µ +b2µ ≤ωa0 <2 a0, n = sµ - 1 ≥ 1, ω: = 2cos π S +1, s ∈N. Many work is devoted to assessments of the coefficients of trigonometric polynomials (see, for example, the work of A.S. Belov and S.V. Konyagin and an extensive bibliography in them). We also note that, unlike a number of spectral methods in the design of the AF, integral devices are not used; Formula (2) has a purely arithmetic character, from it, for example, with a0 = 0, arithmetic formulas for Fourier coefficients are obtained: aµ = m∑ j = 1 x j · tn (λλ j), bµ = m∑ j = 1 x x x x j · tn (π 2µ λ j). This note considers the task of constructing the AFO to highlight two harmonics in the form of τµ (t)+τν (t)+a0 · m∑ j = 1 x j = 1 x j · tn (t –λ j), 1 ≤µ <ν≤ n, (3) and receiving accurate assessments of the sums of steam harmonics. Of course, two harmonics can be distinguished by combining the actions of two AFA AF (2), however, this method cannot be accurately harmonicized by this method. The task turned out to be much more complicated as a problem for one harmonic and in the general case could not be solved. Solutions were found only for steam (µ, ν) = (1, n) and (µ, ν) = (2, n). For some other couples, numerical methods for building AFU are developed. Theorem. In the case of (µ, ν) = (1, n) we have m = n and 2a0 −τ1 (t) −τn (t) = 4 n +1 n∑ k = 1 sin2 λk 2 tn (t –λk), λk = λ (1) k = 2πk n +1. IN AND. Danchenko, D.Ya. Danchenko 145 in the case (µ, ν) = (2, n), n = 2s −1, s ∈N, in the formula (3) m = n, phases λk = λ (2) k are the arguments of the roots of ZK of the next polynomial ( Fraction of reduction) gn (z) = z (z2s +1 +1) sin accord (z2 −1) (z2s +1 −1) sin S4 −2 z2 cos (∗) +1, ng = π 2s +1. The polynomial GN has exactly N of different roots of EIλk lying on a single circle. XK multipliers are all negative, their amount is equal (−2cos engine). Consequence. For the non -negative polynomial TN ̸≡ 0 for all T, we have τ1 (t)+τn (t) ≤ 2a0, τ2 (t)+τn (t) ≤ 2a0 cos π 2s +1 (n = 2s −1). Estimates are accurate. They turn into equality with t = 0 on the polynomial t ∗ n (t) = n∏ k = 1 sin2 (t +λ (1.2) k 2).
