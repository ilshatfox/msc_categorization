) The Walesha Constant Constant for the Walbes system for the Walsha Fayn system installed [1] re 41 buretral formulas L2N = LN and L2N + 1 = (LN + 1 + LN + 1)/2. Using only these formulas and ratio L1 = 1, the following statements can be obtained. 1. The property of symmetry (proved in [2]): l2m+k = l2m+1–k, where 0 ≤ k <2m. 2. ∆L2N = 12 (1 + ∆LN)> 0, ∆L2N + 1 = 1 2 (∆LN - 1) <0; Max (| ∆L2N |, | ∆L2N + 1 |) = 12 (1 + | ∆LN |). 3. 0 <| ∆LN | <1 for n ≥ 2; maxn∈] m [| ∆LN | = ∆L2M = - ∆L2M+1–1 = 1–2 - m; If n ∈] M [, N 6 = 2M, N 6 = 2M+1 - 1, then | ∆LN | <1 - 2 --m. 4. With m ≥ 2, there are exactly two points of the maximum TM, connected by the variety equation TM+2 = tm+1+2TM with the initial condition t0 = 1, t1 = 3 for calculating the left point of the maximum tm ′ and the same an equation with the initial condition t0 = 2, t1 = 3 for calculating the right point of the maximum tm ′, with TM ′ and 2TM -1 ′ (similarly TM ′ ′ and 2TM -1 ′ ′) - neighboring points, that is, they differ by 1 . 5. tm ′ ′ = tm -1 ′ + 2m, tm ′ = tm -1 ′ ′ + 2m -1 and tm ′ = tm -2 ′ + 2m. 6. TM ′ = 13 (2 m + 2 + (−1) m + 1), tm ′ ′ = 13 (5 · 2m + (−1) m). 7. am+1> am and they satisfy the diverse equation 2am+2 --am+1 --am = 1 with the initial condition a0 = 1, a1 = 3/2, the solution is AM = 19 (3m+10+(−1) M+12 --m). 8. CM satisfy the diverse equation 2cm + 1 + cm = 1 with the initial condition c1 = 1/2, the solution of which is cm = - m∑ k = 1 (−1 2) k = 1 3 (1–1 2) m ). The designations are used here: ∆yn = yn+1 - yn for the difference in forward,] m [for integers from 2m to 2m+1 - 1, am = maxn mail] m [ln for the maximum values ​​of the circuits in the pack, tm for the point Maximum in the pack - ltm = am, cm = ∆am - 1 for the growth of maximum values ​​from pack to pack. The formulated statements are not difficult to prove precisely in the indicated manner. In [1] it is noted that the formulas for TM ′ from paragraph 6 and for AM were received, but not published, Rademacher in 1921. They are used in [1] for evidence (having spaces) 42
