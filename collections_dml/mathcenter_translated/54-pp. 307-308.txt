Summarized operator of the convolution of Dankla A.I. Rakhimova1, V.V. Napalkov2 1 alsu1405@mail.ru; Bashkir State University 2 napalkov@matem.anrb.ru; The Institute of Mathematics with the Central Executive Committee of the UC RAS ​​in the work considers the generalized operator of Dankla and its properties. The operator of the package built on it is studied. Keywords: generalized operator Dankla, operator of Dankle’s package, Dankle transformation, own function. The work considers Dankla Operator λ F (Z) = D D Z F (Z)+ C Z (F (Z)+ F ( - Z)), C> 0. Its effect on the whole function F (Z) has the form λ f (z) = Φ∑ k = 0 akφ (k) z k - 1, where φ (k) = 12πi ´ k edition (1 ă2 + c (1 ă + 1 ₽ --π)) dival = k + c (1 + eπi (ki (k +1)). The generalized Dankla operator is determined by the formula λ f (z) = d d z f (z)+ C z m --1∑ j = 0 α J f (α J z), c> 0, α j = e 2πi j m, j = (0; m −1 ). Its effect on the whole function f (z) has the form λ f (z) = φ∑ k = 0 akφ (k) z k - 1, where φ (k) = 12πi ´ k edition (1 ξ2 + c m - 1 j = j = 0 e 2πi j m ₽ - 2πi jm) daw = k + c m - 1 j = 0 e 2πi j (k + 1) m. The resulting row is determined by the decomposition of Adamar. If the condition φ (k) = p (k) is met, where p (k) is some polynomial, and p (0) = 0, p (k)> 0, k> 0, then the generalized operator of Dankla is the operator of the Helfond-Leontiev . Theorem 1. For the operator λ, the ratio λ f (z) = 1z (f0 (ă), f (edition)) is performed, where the functionality F0 (Z) is such that the function associated with it has the form: g (z) = 1 z2 + C m - 1∑ j = 0 e 2πi j m z - 2πi jm. Theorem 2. The own function of the generalized operator of Dankle in the general case has the form: y (λz) = c0 (1+ ger∑ k = 1 λk zk onic (1) onic (2) ... onic (k)) ∀c0 ∈C . Dankle shift operator has the form: ST [F (Z)] = F (Z)+ ger k = 1 T K φ (1) φ (2) ... φ (k) λk f (z), z, t ∈ C. 308 Materials of the International School-Conference Operator of the Danclis functionality F (z) ∈ H ∗ (C) and functions f (z) ∈ H (C) is determined by the formula Mf [f (z)] = (f (t), ST [ f (z)]), z, t ∈C.

Sabitov1 1 sabitov_fmf@mail.ru; Sterlitamak branch of the Institute of Strategic Research of the Republic of Belarus, Sterlitamak branch of the Bashkir State University for the equation of fluctuations in the final beam studied the initial-border tasks and the initial task for the endless beam. Problem solutions are constructed in explicitly and the corresponding theorems of uniqueness and existence in the class of regular decisions have been proved. Key words: the equation of the beam, initial-border tasks, the initial task, the spectral method, unity, existence, row, stability. Many tasks about fluctuations in rods, beams and plates, which are important in construction mechanics, theory of stability of rotating shafts and vibration of ships lead to differential equations of a higher order. Let the beam L length L for certainty are based on two supports using pin devices. Under the influence of the continuous external power of G (X, T), designed for a unit of length, forced bending transverse fluctuations of a homogeneous beam, in the absence of rotational movement during bend, are described by an equation of a fourth order [1, p. 141 - 143], [2, p. 278 - 280] ρsut t +e juxxxx = g (x, t),
