Bulygin1 1 Alexey.buligin@gmail.com; Northern (Arctic) Federal University named after M.V. Lomonosov examines the properties of locally full of like homogeneous heterogeneous rerevians. Displays of some classes of the R-VERVEV, keeping the distance of one. Keywords: like a homogeneous space, R-Vreyevo, a metric in the work, some properties are studied like homogeneous heterogeneous metric spaces with internal metric, in particular R-brushes. Like homogeneous spaces are a natural generalization of homogeneous riman spaces, the geometry of which is well studied from various points of view, see, for example, [1]. The results obtained are a continuation of geometry studies like homogeneous R-brushes presented in [2]. Determination 1. Under the segment in X with the ends of x, y ∈ X is understood the image in the X numerical segment [a, b] ⊂R with isometric attachment I: [a, b] → x, in which I (a) = x and i and i and i I and i and i I and I (b) = y. Space X is called geodetic if any two points X, Y ∈ X can be connected by a segment. Determination 2. Space X is called similar to homogeneous if for any point x, y ∈ X there is a semblance of ∈, translating X into wor (x) = y. If for any A.I. Bulygin 39 x, y ∈ X exists isometry ∈, translating X into Y, space X is called homogeneous. Determination 3. Space X is called locally complete if for any point x ∈ X is determined the number R> 0, for which the closed ball b (x, r) is full in the metric D. The exact upper facet of radius R, for which the ball b (x, r) is full, is called the radius of completeness at point X. For the radius of completeness in [3], the designation C (x) is adopted. If c (x0) =+φ at least at one point x0 ∈ X, then the space x is complete and C (x) =+inous in all points x ∈ X. Theorem 1. (Bereestovsky V.N., see [3]) Locally complete like a homogeneous space X is homogeneous and only when it is full. Further, homogeneous spaces that are not homogeneous are considered solely, so the function C (X) is certain everywhere. Determination 4. Non-trivial (containing more than one point) geodetic space (x, d) is called R-Vreyv if the combination of any two segments [x y] and [y z] in X, the intersection of which is their common end Y is again a segment [XZ ]. In other words, X is a war, if any side of the arbitrary triangular △ x y z in X is contained in the unification of the other two sides: [xz] ⊂ [x y] ∪ [y z]. Determination of 5. R-drone is called a symptyal tree if it has a structure of a one-dimensional sympenial complex. The zero symplexes of such a complex are called peaks, and one -dimensional - with ribs of a symptyal tree. Each rib e = [x y] compares a certain positive number ℓ (e) - its length. The metric of the Simpleic tree X is an internal metric, in which the distance between the peaks X, Y ∈ X is equal to the sum of the lengths of the ribs, which make up the metric segment [x y]. In the 1960s. HELL. Aleksandrov formulated the general problem of characterizing metric spaces: “Find conditions sufficient to ensure that the following characterization of isometries be performed in the metric (M, D). Any bijection f: m → m, which retains the fixed distance R, is the isometry, along with the backward display. ” Determination 6. For points x, y ∈ M, the jump path of length N between them is defined as a display γ: {0.1 ,. . . , n} → m, in which γ (0) = x, γ (n) = y and d (γ (i - 1), γ (i)) = 1 for all ∈ {1,. . . , n}. The number n is called the length of the jump path γ. Sentence 1. Let the X -complete Simplian tree, for which all the distances between the peaks are the diet
