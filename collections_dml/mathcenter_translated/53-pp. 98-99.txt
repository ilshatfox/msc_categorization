. Mikhailovskaya Y. A. Mikhailovskaya Kazan (Volga) Federal University, yana.michailovskaya@yandex.ru computable linear orders and the Ershov hierarchy is devoted to the study of computable line orders, whose signature is added to the SNL and FL signature, given as follows as follows (here (x, y) l = {z | x <l z <l y}): s2kl (x, y) ⇌ | (x, y) l | = 0∨ = 2 ∨. . . ∨ = 2k, s2k+1l (x, y) ⇌ | (x, y) l | = 1∨ = 3 ∨. . . ∨ = 2k + 1, fla (x, y) ↔ ∃n ∈ ω (| (x, y) l | = n). Drying 1. For any (n + 1) -V.p. sets a computable linear order L, ordered by type ω, such that SNL ≡ TA. The investigation 1. There is a computable linear man of the dock L such that the spectrum of the SNL ratio consists exactly of all (n+ 1) -V.p. degrees. Drying 2. For any linear line of line l from the calculation of S0L, the calculation of SNL for any n. Drying 3. There is a computable linear line L, in which SKL relations for all K> n are computed, but the SNL ratio is not computable. Ya. A. Mikhailovskaya 99 sentence 4. There is a computable linear line L, in which SNL relations for all N are computed, but the ratio of the FL block is not computed. Dry 5. Let l - the calculated linear order containing only the final number of length blocks 6 (n+1). Then, from the calculation of SNL, the calculation of S 0 l is followed. The following theorem was also proved. Let the calculated linear order L have an infinitely many blocks of length 2 and the ratio of S1L is calculated. Then there is a computable linear order R such that R ∼ = L, S1R is calculated, but S0R is not computable. L and T R A T R A 1. Downey R.G, LEMPS., Wug.
