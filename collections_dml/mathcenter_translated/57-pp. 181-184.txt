UDC 517.518.234 + 517.548.3 The representations of the second kind to solutions to the common linear evenly elliptical systems on the plane of SB Clement1 1 sbklimentov@sfedu.ru; Southern Federal University, Yumi of the INC of the Russian Academy of Sciences in the work examines the representations of the second kind for the solutions of the Sobolevo classes of the general uniformly elliptical system of the first order in a single -bonded limited flat region with the class of the classw k - 1p p. It has been established that when undergoing assumptions about the coefficients of the system and the border of the region, the operators used are the isomorphisms of banach spacesw (G), k ≥ 1, p> 2. These results are new even for solutions to the canonical elliptic system of the first order (generalized analytical functions In the sense of I.N. century). Key words: first -order elliptical linear systems, generalized analytical functions, solutions. We denote through g, ∂g = l, a limited single -copper area in a complex ζ - plastry. The article uses the following standard functional spaces with standard norms in them: C Kα (G), K ≥ 0, 0 <α <1, W KP (G), P> 2, space W K - 1P P (L) traces of functions from w k p (g). We will say that the circuit l ∈ C Kα, K ≥ 1, 0 <α ≤ 1 (w l - 1p (l), l ≥ 2, p> 2) if there is a homeomorphic display ζ = f (z) circumference γ On L class 182 materials of the School-Conference C Kα (γ) (w l-1p p (γ)) such that f ′ (z) ̸ = 0. Note that the reverse display Z = F −1 (ζ) There will be class C Kα (l) (W l - 1p p (l)). In this case, the display ζ = f (z) (as the opposite) is called the diplomorphism of the class C Kα (W l - 1p p) of the contours γ and l. Analo is diligently determined by the dipheurorphism of any contours of the corresponding smoothness. Consider in the region G, ∂g = l, ζ-ζ-plane general linear elliptic system of the first order in the complex record DW ≡W +Q1 (ζ) ∂ζW +Q2 (ζ) ∂ζ̄W +A (ζ) W +B ( ζ) W = r (ζ), (1) where ζ = ₽+Iη, w = w (ζ) = u (ζ)+i v (ζ) - the desired complex function, ∂ζ̄ = 1/2 (∂/∂ cil+ i∂/∂η), ∂ζ = 1/2 (∂/∂ă ∂/∂ ∂ ∂), - derived in the sense of Sobolev, Q1 (ζ) and Q2 (ζ) - specified measurable complex functions that satisfy The condition of the uniform elliptical system (1): | q1 (ζ) |+ | Q2 (ζ) | ≤ Q0 = const <1, ∈ ∈G, A (ζ), B (ζ), R (ζ) ∈ LP (G), P> 2, also specified complex functions. Denote T F (ζ) = tg f (ζ) = - 1 π ï g f (τ) τ - ζd xd y, τ = x + i y, ∂ζ̄t f (ζ) = f (ζ) (see [1 ], there is also a bibliography). The representation of the second kind to solve the system (1) is based on well from the messenger formula Pompey [1, p. 41, 57, 69]: If W (ζ) ∈ W 1P (G), p> 2, ∂g = l ∈ C 1, then W (ζ) = 1 2πi ∫ l w (τ) τ - τdτ - 1 π ï g ∂w ∂τ̄ · d xd y τ - ζ, τ = x + i y. и имеет вид:  Ω(w) = 1 2πi  ∫ L  w(τ)  τ−ζdτ+T R(ζ)  где Ω(w) ≡ w(ζ)+T (q1∂τw +q2∂τ̄w + Aw +B w ) (ζ). At the same time, the question of the reversibility of the operator of the PIC naturally arises. This question is when G = D is a single circle is investigated in [2], and in the case when G is an arbitrary limited single -legged area, partially studied in [3], where the following statements are established (in the quoted articles you can find a more detailed Review of work on this topic). Theorem 1. If q1 (ζ), q2 (ζ) ∈ C (G), A (ζ), b (ζ) ∈ LP (G), p> 2, ∂g = l ∈ C 1α, 0 <α < 1, then ω - (materially) linear isomorphism of the banakh space W 1P (G). Theorem 2. If q1 (ζ), q2 (ζ), a (ζ), b (ζ) ∈ C Kα (G), k ≥ 0, 0 <α, ∂g = l ∈ C K+1α, then ω - (materially) linear isomorphism of the banakh space c k+1α (G). S.B. Clement 183 serious complication in the proof of these theorems, compared with the case of Q1 (ζ) = Q2 (ζ) ≡ 0 studied by I.N. Eyeua is that the integro - differential operator T (Q1∂τW+Q2∂τ̄W+AW+B W), generally speaking, will not be quite continuous in the corresponding banana spaces. The main result of this work, complementing the above theorems, is the theorem 3. If Q1 (ζ), Q2 (ζ), a (ζ), b (ζ) ∈ W KP (G), K ≥ 1, P> 2, ∂g = L ∈ W K+1P P, then ω - (materially) linear isomorphism of the banakh space w+1p (G). We give one (obvious) important consequence of theorem 3. Theorem 4. In the assumptions of theorem 3 for any function w (z) ∈W KP (G), K ≥ 1, there is a priori assessment: ∥W∥W KP (G) ≤ const { ∥DW∥W K -1P (G) +∥W∥ W K - 1P P (L)}, where COST depends only on K, P and the norms of BW K -1p (G) operator D. remark. It should be noted that in the case of a single circle of reasoning for classes C Kα (D) and W K P (D) differ slightly [2]. In the transition to an arbitrary single -link area with the border of proper regularity, this is not so. Methodology of the transition from a single circle to the region with the border of Class
