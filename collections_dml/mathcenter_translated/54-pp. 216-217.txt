Materials of the International School-Conference UDC 517.52 On the maximum density of the sequence of numbers A.F. Kuzhaev1 1 arsenkuzh@outlook.com; The Bashkir State University in the work announces the relationship between different densities of a positive sequence and the values ​​associated with them. Namely, a formula for calculating the maximum density of a positive sequence is given. Key words: sequence of positive numbers, maximum density, upper density. Through λ = {λn, mn} و = 1 we will denote a multiple sequence of positive numbers. More precisely: {λn} mmn = 1 - unlimited strictly increasing positive sequence, and MN - a natural number called the multiplicity of the element λn, n ê 1. Recall that the upper density of the sequence of the eleals is called n̄ (λ) = lim t →+urb n n. N n. (t, λ) t, n (t, λ) = ∑ λnét mn. In addition, we will need a characteristic introduced by J. Polya (see [1]) - the maximum density of the sequence λ: n̄0 (λ) = lim Δ →+0 lim t →+و (t, λ) −n (t (t (t (t, λ) 1-p), λ) δt, Δ ∈ (0; 1). According to the lem of the paragraph E3 of chapter IV of the book [2], the limit of the according to →+0 always exists, so the maximum density is determined correctly. In addition, we will also need the following values: l̄ (λ, δ) = lim t →+φ λ (t) − (t (1–δ)) - ln (1–af), λ (t) = ∑ ∑ ∑ λnét mn λn, Δ ∈ (0; 1). The value of L̄ (λ, δ) was first introduced, apparently, L.A. Rubele in [3], and is closely connected with the logarithmic block of positive sequence. By definition, this is l̄ (λ) = Inf Δ ed (0; 1) l̄ (λ, δ). Subsequently, the ruble and P. Malliaven in their joint work [4] showed that in the case of the final upper density, the logarithmic block dexterity can be determined as follows: l̄ (λ) = lim Δ → 1 l̄ (λ, δ), that is, this limit always exists. The logarithmic blockness turned out to be the most important characteristic of a positive sequence in resolving the issue of the completeness of the system of the exhibits in the horizon strip (see [3]). Using these designations, the following is formulated by A.Yu. Kuznetsova 217 Theorem. Employment ofevermoetrieth Upper Distribution. Then the righteous equality of n̄0 (λ) = lim Δ →+0 l̄ (λ, δ) = SUP Δ ed (0; 1) l̄ (λ, δ). Literature 1. Polya G. Untersuchungen über lücken und Singularitäten von Potenzreihen // Math.

UDC 517.98 C ∗-algebra, generated by a display, which induces the inverse half group A.Yu. Kuznetsova1 1 alla/kuznetsova@gmail.com; Kazan (Volga) Federal University in the article discusses C ∗-albras generated by special species display. The display specified on the counting set induces the family of partial isometry operators, which generates the studied algebra. The work provides conditions under which this family multiplictively gives rise to an inverse half -group, and the corresponding algebras are studied. Keywords: C ∗-Algebra, inverse half-group, invariant subspace, general shift operator, algebra greenhouse. Let ffic: x - → x The display of the counting set X in itself, satisfying the condition of the Card pul - 1 [x] <mm for any x ∈ X. The graph (x, gment) with the vertices at the points of the set X and the ribs (x, onic (x)) is associated with the pair (x, ∗). C ∗-Algebra C ∗ ∗ (X), generated by the display ∗, is associated with this graph. The structure C ∗ ∗ (x) was proposed in [1]. We assume that the graph (x, gment) is coherent. In addition, we believe that wor (x) ̸ = x is not with any n ∈N and x ∈ X.
