Enikeev1 1 enikeeva.svetlana@mail.ru; Kazan National Research Technological University in the article proposes the theoretical justification of the method of the smallest squares for a weakly singular integral equation. Keywords: weakly singular integral equation, the method of the smallest squares, polynomial approximation, convergence of the method. Numerous applied and theoretical tasks of mathematics, mechanics, physics, chemistry and technology lead to the need to solve various classes of integral equations with varied logarithmic nuclei in the main part of the integral operator. Consider the weakly singular integral equation of the first type K x ≡ 1 π +1 −1 p (τ) ln | τ - t | x (τ) dτ +1 π ˆ +1 −1 p (τ) h (t, τ) ) X (τ) dτ = y (t), −1 ≤ t ≤ 1. (1) S.P. Enikeeva 149 HERE H (t, τ) and y (t) - known functions, x (τ) - the desired function, and p (t) - the weight function of Chebyshev of the third or fourth kind: p (t) = √ 1∓t 1 ± t. Such equations, as a rule, are definitely not solved. Therefore, there is a need to develop close methods of solving them with the corresponding theoretical justification. For these purposes, we use the approach proposed in [1, 2] (and used, for example, in [3.4]), based on the corresponding choice of the spaces of the right parts (we denote this space through Y) and the desired elements X. Then K can be considered as a reversible linear operator acting from x = l2, p (−1,1) in y = w 12, q [−1,1], where Q = 1/P, W 12, Q [−1 , 1] = {onic (s) ∈ C [−1,1]: ∃icle ′ (s) ∈ L2, Q (−1,1)}. In this case, the task of solving a weakly singular integral equation (1) is correctly set. Let the weight function P (t) = √ 1+t 1–t and {pk (t)} ger K = 0 - the system of orthonal polynomas for this weight. It is known that in this case PK (t) = tk+1 (t) –tk (t) t - 1, k ≥ 1, where tk (t) = cos (k arccos t) - Polina Chebyshev of the first kind. Here is a computational scheme and theoretical justification of the method of the smallest squares. The approximate solution of equation (1) is searched in the form of a polynoma xn (t) = n∑ k = 1 αk pk -1 (t) = n∑ k = 1 βk t k - 1. (2) Unknown permanent αk, βK are determined from the conditions: ∥y −k xn∥2y ⇒ min. And this, as you know, leads to the following system of linear algebraic equations (abbreviated, SLAU) n∑ k = 1 αk (k pk -1, k p j - 1) y = (y, k p j - 1) y, j = 1 , n, (3) where for any ∗, ψ ∈ Y we believe (∗, ψ) y = (onic, ψ) 2, p + (onic ′, ψ ′) 2, q, (ship, ψ) 2, p = +1´ −1 p (t) onic (t) ψ (t) d t, (onic ′, ψ ′) 2, q = +1´ q (t) ′ ′ (t) ψ ′ (t) d t. Then Y turns into a hyilbert space with the norm ∥ ventration = √ ∥ç∥22, p +∥′∥∥22, q. We denote through h the operator set by the second integral in the left side of the equation (1). Theorem. Let the operator K: X → Y Continue, and the core H (t, τ) is such that the operator h: x → y is continuous. Then, with all natural ns (3) it has the only solution α ∗ 1, α ∗ 2 ,. . . , α ∗ n (β ∗ 1, β ∗ 2,., β ∗ n) for any n = 1.2 ,. . . The approximate solution x ∗ n (t) = ∑n k = 1α ∗ k pk - 1 (t) = ∑n k = 1β ∗ k t k - 1 at N → و goes to the exact solution x ∗ (k −1y) (t) equations (1) in the space x = l2, p (−1,1). The error of the approximate solution can be appreciated by the inequality ∥x ∗ ∗ n∥x ≤ ν (k) · en (x ∗) x, 150 materials of the international school-conference where ν (k) = ∥k ∥x → y · ∥k −1∥y → X - the number of due to the operator k: x → y, a en (x ∗) x - the best approximation of the function
