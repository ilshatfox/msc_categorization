The limitations of nonlinear integrated operas and the tori volterr A is known [1] that if the Uryson integral operator (t) = j k (t, s, x (s)) ds Ri acts in the space of LP (RL) (1 :::: ; p <oo) and is limited on some ball, then it will be limited on any ball about the wanderings of LP (! L). In case of proof of this statement, the essential role is played by the properties of the spaces of LP (! 1) at 1 :::; p <88 OS. The space L00 (P) does not have these properties. Nevertheless, the statement of the limited integral operator in some cases turned out to be fair for the space of L00 (P). In this note, the corresponding approval is considered for integrated operators of Bolterra and the space of the Armed Forces [a, OO) (continuous analogue of space L00 (A, OO)). We denote through the m class of nonlinear integrated opera opera operating in the space of the Armed Forces [a, oo) and having the form T (KX) (t) = / k (t, s, x (s)) ds, and where is the function K ( t, s, 0 is continuous at a :::;: s $ t <oo, (e (-o, +oo). We note that each operator is continuously limited to dissection almost everywhere. Theorem. Every operator k E M, limited: find on a certain ball of space of the Armed Forces [a, oo), will be fraud-on the ryn bom wape of this space. At the same time, the operator is the only way to grow up on the space L00 (A, OO) with a “conviction” of the “continuation” of the OM is a carrier.
