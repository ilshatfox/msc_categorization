UDC 517.9 On the task of Koshi for an ordinary differential equation with a fractional derivative in the main part of Yu.R. Agachev1, A.V.

Lobachevsky 2 Avsavina@kpfu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.I. Lobachevsky in the article examines the task of Koshi for one class of linear ordinary differential equations with a fractional derivative in the main part in the case when the known coefficients of the equation belong to the Helder class. The correctness of the task in a specially constructed pair of functional spaces is proved. On the basis of the apparatus of algebraic polynomas, approaches to the exact solution of the problem under study are built. Keywords: linear equation, fractional -radio equation, the task of the Koshi, the correct setting, and the approximate solution. LetM - a fixed natural number, the material number α is subordinated to the condition M −1 <α <m. The work examines the task of Koshi X (i) = 0, I = 0, M −1, (1) 10 Materials of the Youth Conference for the differential equation of the fractional order of the type K x ≡ (dαa+x) (t)+(t)+ m∑ i = 1 pi (t) x (m --i) (t) = y (t), a <t ≤ b, (2) where Pi (t), y (t) are known, x (t) –Iskoic functions on [a, b]; dαa+x is the left -sided derivative of Riemann - Liwill (see, for example, in [1, p. 44]) order α of the function x (t): (dαa+x) (t) (t) ≡ 1 γ (m −α) d m d t m t∫ a x (τ) dτ (t –τ) α --m+1, (3) γ (·)-gamma function. The existence of this derivative is ensured by the condition t∫ a x (τ) dτ (t -) α --m+1 ∈ AC M -1 [a, b], where AC M - 1 [a, b] means a class of functions f (t) having an absolutely continuous derivative of F (M - 1) (t) order m - 1 (f (m - 1) ∈ AC [a, b] ≡ ac 0 [a, b]). Since the desired function X (t) in the problem (1), (2) has a derivative of the order M - 1, the known properties of fractional derivatives allow you to convert the formula (3): (DαA+X) (t) ≡ 1 γ (1– {α α α }) D D T∫ A X (M -1) (τ) dτ (t τ) {α} = (D {α} A+X (m - 1)) (t), (4) where {α} is fractional Part of the number α. Let hβ ≡ hβ [a, b] - the space of functions that satisfy the [a, b] condition of the Helder with indicator β, 0 <β <1. through H0, β denote its subspace of functions that turn to zero at point A. We introduce the norm in the Hool space in the usual way: ∥ f ∥β = ∥ f ∥c +h (f; β), f ∈ Hβ. Here ∥ f ∥c is the usual Max-Norm in the space of continuous in the segment [a, b] functions, h (f; β)-the smallest constant gelder F ther Hβ. We introduce into consideration the operator of the fractional integration of Riman -Liwill I {α} a+ order {α}. This operator, as you know, carries out mutual and one-digit correspondence H0, β on h0, {α}+ β, if 0 <β <{α β <1. Then the fractional-radio operator d {α} a+ translates the space H0, {α}+β on h0, β. We define a couple of spaces in which we will consider the original task. Let y = h0, β, x = w̃ m - 1h0, {α}+β - the space of functions that satisfy the conditions (1) and have a derivative of the order - 1 belonging to H0, {α}+β. We set the norm in space X according to the formula ∥x∥x = ∥x (m - 1) ∥ {α}+β, x ∈ X. In a pair of spaces (x, y), the task (1), (2) will write in the operator form K x ≡ dx +gx = y (x ∈ X, y ∈ Y), (5) Yu.R. Agachev, A.V. Guskova 11 where, taking into account the formula (4), (dx) (t) = (D {α} a+x (m - 1)) (t), (gx) (t) = m∑ i = 1 pi ( t) x (m --i) (t). The following theorem 1. Let the material number γ satisfy the condition {α}+β <γ≤ 1 and the assumptions are made: 1) pi ∈ H0, γ [a, b], i = 1, m; 2) y ∈ H0, β [a, b]. Then the equation (5) (and, consequently, the task (1), (2)) in pair (x, y) is correctly set along Adamar. Note that for the fractional derivative of the order, α occurs [1, p. 44] Consistent (dαa+x) (a) = 0, if x (t) = (t —a) α --i, i = 1.2 ,. . . , [α] +1. Given this property for the fractional production, the approximate solution of the equation (5) will be found in the form of xn (t) = (t —a) α n∑ i = 0 ci t i, (6) let HN have a subspace of algebraic polynomas no higher than n. In the spaces introduced above, we introduce subspace: XN - the subspace of generalized polynomas of the species (6), yn = Hn. Let pn: y → yn - an arbitrarily fixed design operator Y on yn. We will solve the problem (1), (2) by the general polynomial projection method, according to which unknown polynoma coefficients (6) are determined from the equation KN ≡ dxn +pngxn = pn y (xn ∈ XN). (7) Note that with a specific election of the design operator, we will radiate computing schemes of a particular project
