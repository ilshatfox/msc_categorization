Kalitvin2 1 kalitvinas@mail.ru; Lipetsk State Pedagogical University named after P.P. Semenovatyan-Shansky 2 kalitvin@gmail.com; Lipetsk State Pedagogical University named after P.P. Semenovatyan-Shansky in the article considers the task of Koshi for the non-linear integroDifferential equation of Barbashin with a private second-order derivative. The task under consideration is equivalent to the integral equation of Voltaire with private integrals. The conditions of unambiguous resolution of the integral equation were obtained, therefore, the tasks of Koshi. Keywords: Barbashin’s integro-radio-radical equation, Koshi's task, Voltaire's integral equation with private integrals. We will call the integro-differential equation of Barbashin (Idub) an integro-differential equation, in which an unknown function with A.S. Kalitvin, V.A. Kalitvin 171 is kept under the sign of a private derivative and under the sign of the integral, and the private derivative of this function is calculated by one variable, and its integration is carried out according to another variable. The foundations of the theory of Idub with a private derivative of the first order are built in [1]. At the same time, Idub was interpreted as differential equations in the banach space or boiled down to integral equations with private integrals. When interpreting linear Idub, differential equations in the banach space, the resolution of the latter is ensured by the conditions of strong continuity of operator function that determine differential equations. Such conditions are contained in [1] in cases where the operator-function takes values ​​in the spaces of linear operators, continuous in the space of continuous functions, in the spaces of the Lebag, in banach ideal spaces. In the case of the information of the Koshi task for linear Idub to the linear integral equations of Voltairer with private integrals, the unambiguous resolution of the integrated equations is ensured by zero spectral radius of the corresponding linear operator Voltaire with private integrals. The conditions of equality zero spectral radius of the linear Voltaire operators with private integrals in various classes of functional spaces are given in [2-4]. We note the work [5], which gives an example of a banakh functional space and linear operator Voltairer with private integrals and continuous nuclei, the spectral radius of which is more than zero in this space. This note considers the nonlinear Idub ∂2x (t, s) ∂t 2 = f (t, s, x (t, s))+ ˆ d c n (t, s, σ, x (t, σ)) dσ+ g (t, s) (1) with the initial condition x (a, s) = onic (s), x ′ t (a, s) = ψ (s). (2) It is assumed that t ∈ [A, B], S ∈ [C, D], [A, B] and [C, D] - the final segments, the set functions f, n, g, ∗, ψ are continuous, Functions F and N satisfy the condition of the lips: | f (t, s, u) - f (t, s, v) | ≤ f0 (t, s) | u - v |, | n (t, s, σ, u) −n (t, s, σ, v) | ≤ n0 (t, s, σ) | u - v |, where F0 and N0 are some continuous functions, integral in (1) is understood in the sense of the Lebeby, and the solution of the problem (1)/(2) is considered continuous on [a, b] × [c, d] together with x ′ ′ t (t, s) function x (t, s), satisfying Idub (1) and initial conditions (2).
