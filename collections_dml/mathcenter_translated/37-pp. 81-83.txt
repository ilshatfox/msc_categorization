Restoring the temperature field of rocks in the vicinity of the well according to its thermometry after stopping the temperature of the rocks in the vicinity of the vertical discharge well, fundamentally depends on the presence of 82 filtration of the liquid. This is also reflected in the temperature restoration curve (kW) in the well after it stops. This effect is used to detect possible violations of the integrity of the well barrel. The temperature of the rocks θ (r, τ) in the vicinity of the vertical well in the absence of convection for each vertical mark is described by the non -stationary equation of thermal conductivity (direct task). The initial temperature distribution θ0 (r) around the well at the time of its stop should be determined; Only its value is known outside the zone of thermal influence θ0 (φ) = θg. Additionally, the results of the thermometry of the well after stopping are set, namely, the values ​​θjw = θ (rw, τj) in moments of time j = 1, ..., nt. This task refers to the class of incorrect reverse tasks with an unknown initial condition [1]. Its quasi is defined as the function θ0 (r), minimizing the functionality ρ (θ0) = 1 2nt nt∑ j = 1 [θ (rw, τj, θ0) - θw (τj)] 2 → Inf. (1) The only solution to the variation problem (1) exists only on the compact class of the correctness of MP with the final uniformly limited set of parameters. Such parameters restrictions were taken into account by introducing penal functionality. The direct problem was solved numerically [2]. The reverse task (1) was solved by gradient descent (with a crushing step). To accelerate the convergence of the gradient method, the so -called. The ravine method [3]. It gives the stepped nature of the minimization of the functionality (1), as shown for a model example in Fig. 1. 83 Frame 0 N P 100 200 300 10-16 10-14 10-12 10-10 10-8 10-6 10-4 10-2 Fig. 1. Vertical lines - steps along the bottom of the ravine, “horizontal” - sinquest descent iterations were carried out by parameterization of the correctness class with cubic splashes.
