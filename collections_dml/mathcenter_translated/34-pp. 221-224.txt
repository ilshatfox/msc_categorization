. Modular classes and canonical homologies of Poasson structures on R2 V.V. Shurygin (ml.) Kazan State University, vadimjr@ksu.ru let m - smooth diversity. We will denote the alge of the BRU of smooth functions on m through CU (M), a ring of differential forms on m through ω ∗ (M) and the outer algebra to the Sosymmetric controversial tensor fields on M through V ∗ (M). The Poisson's tensor (or the puasson structure) on M is the tensor w ∈ V2 (m), such that [w, w] = 0, where [·, · · · bastard of teenachis on v ∗ (m) [1]. The variety of M, endowed with Poisson's tensor W, is called Puas with a sleepy variety and is denoted by a symbol (M, W). Operator σ: vk (m) → vk+1 (m), acting according to the rule σu: = [w, u], satisfies equality σ ° σ = 0. Therefore, the complex (v ∗ (m), σ) is determined and determined The spaces of his clamps HKP (M, W) called the claws of Yami Poisson Poassonov (M, W). 223 in the work of J.-L. Koshulya [2] was introduced by the operator Δ: ωk (m) → ωk -1 (m) acting by the formula Δ = [i (W), D] = I (W) ° D - D ° I (W), where D - external differential, and i (w): ωk (m) → ωk -2 (m) means internal multiplication by W. It also shows that Δ ° δ = 0. Thus, the complex (ω ∗ (m), δ) is associated with each Poasson variety. Its homology h (ω ∗ (m), δ) = h ∗ can (m, w) are called the canonical homologs of Poassonov Valia (m, w). An important invariant of the Poasson structure is the MOD DIALLER CLASS (M, W) Poassonov variety (class of the homologies of Poisson of the modular vector field, i.e., the element of the space H1P (M, W)), introduced by A. Weinstein [3]. It is an obstacle to the existence of the form of volume, invariant in relation to the flows of the Hamilton Age of Torny fields. In addition, in the case when MOD (M, W) = 0, Poisson's clamology is naturally dual in nonic homologies [4]. On the plane R2 Poissonova, the structure is set by any tensor w = f ∂x ∧ ∂ ∂y ∈ V2 (R2), 224 where F = F (X, Y) ∈ CU (R2). The modular vector field of such a structure has the form ∆W = ∂f ∂y ∂x - ∂f ∂x ∂ ∂y. In the case when the function F (X, Y) does not turn to zero anywhere on R2, Poissonova structure W is a sympy and its modular class is zero. Theorem 1. Let S = F -1 (0) 6 = ∅. Then the modular class Mod (R2, W) is not equal to zero. In the case when F (X, Y) there is a homogeneous polynomial of two variables, this follows from the results of the work [4,5]. We denote the symbol Cun (R 2) the subscription of the smooth functions on R2, turning to zero at a point (0, 0). Theorem 2. Let S = F -1 (0) 6 = ∅. Then the canonical homologs of Poassonov Diversity (R2, W) have the following form: h0can (r 2, w) ∼ = c least (r2) f (x, y) · cung (r2) ∼ = r ⊕h1can (r2, w) ; H1can (R 2, W) ∼ = CU (R 2) F (X, Y) · CU (R2); H2CAN (R 2, W) = 0.
