) Nonero solutions to operator equations, let x, a - ban. Khovs of space, f: x x a -+ x - opera Rator, exists x • E x, with any>. E, satisfying equality f (x*,>.) = About. The task is set - to determine the conditions under which such x e x,>. E L, that f (x,>.) = O, x ::/:- x*. (1) This task will continue to be called the task (1). For simplicity of records, we put x* = O. Suppose that on many x (up) x l (up), x (up) = {x e x: llxll ~ to}, l (to) = {>. E A: 11> .11 ~ to}, to> o, f (x,>.) = AX+F*(X,>.), A- Linear operator, lim p • 11 (jj>.) = O evenly in>. E L (up), f*(o,>.) = O llxll-+o x on a lot of l (up). Theorem. If a. A - a continuous operator who has an OZRA in the space x the reverse operator, then it is subject to the number 110 d (o, d0], in which the task (1) is not solved on many x (d) x l (e). Let H1. , h2 "" Hn - linearly independent non -zero ale of space x, satisfying equality ahi = o, i e {1.2 ", n}. The report will prove theorems about the conditions of the existence of the unnecessary solution of the problem (1) in the form of n m x = px + l: aihi + 'l: f3; 9 ;, i = l j = l where p is the design operator of the henna space, a linear shell determined by the elements H1, H2,..
