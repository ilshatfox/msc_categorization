Sot use of orthogonal polynomials to the function of brange in studies and solutions of geometric and extreme problems of the theory of complex variable functions is widely used by the method of parametric representations. This Me Tod obtains many important results about the properties of the head of morphic display of canonical areas, in particular, the solution of the well -known Bieberbach hypothesis: ICN (J) J :( N, PE N \ {1}, in the class of functions S, that is, the class of holomorphic one -leaf display J (z) the circle e = {z e c; jz! <1}, satisfying the conditions: f (o) = o, f '(o) = 1. The full solution of the Bberbach problem on the coefficients would be obtained by l. Lj in 1984. An important part of the evidence proposed was the stage of the application of the method of and parametric representations based on the use of the equations of Levner D ((T, Z) = -((T, Z) µ (T) + ((T, (T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T. z), dt µ (t) - (t, z) o ~ t < +oo, with a continuous control function µ (t), / µ (t) / 1, and on a cuper condition ((o, z) = z, zet. Proof of the brange of G. A. Yuferov 319 was reduced to establishing the sign of functions introduced by him .. ,,.

Aski, G. Gasper (2]. In this work, another proof of the constituent of the indicated exponential polynomials of the Branda YS, N (T), which uses the ratio between the polynomials of Che Zhishev, Lyushandra and Gegenbauer, is disgusted by the perceptions of the function of the functions of;, 71 (t) not in the form of the sum of familiar terms, as it is, as it is Initially, it was obtained by foul, and in the form of Sumy we with the components of one sign.
