Volkov The Article Discusses The Connection BetWeen Two Definitions of the Levy-Laplacian on An Infinited Manifold. In the first of the definitions, The Levy-Laplacian Is Defined as Cesaro Mean of the Second Order Directional Derivatives. In the Second One, The Levy-Laplacian Is Given As An Integral Functional Defined by A Sepial Kind of the Second Derivate. Interest in the Levy-Laplacian Is Due to Its Connection with The Gauge Fields. Keywords: Levy-Laplacian, Infinite Dimensional Manifold, Yang-Mills Equations. UDC 517.518 Weak and strong grades for gross operators such as Hausdorf in the P-adic linear space S.S. Hairy 1 volosivetss@mail.ru; The NRU Saratov State University for gross operators such as Hausdorf, determined in the P-adic linear space of CQNP, and their switches with a symbol from the Lipshitz space, we bring sufficient conditions for their limitations from one space of the Lorentz to another. Key words: Hausdorf operator, switch, weak type, Lorentz space, interpolation. Let p - a simple number and x ∈ Q, x ̸ = 0. If x is written in the type x = pγm/n, where γ = γ (x) ∈Z and m, n ∈Z are mutually simple with p, then | x | P: = p --γ (for x = 0, we count | 0 | p = 0). The value | X | P has all the properties of the norm on the field, including equality | x y | p = | x | p | y | p and additional property | x+y | p ≤ max (| x | p, | y | p). Through the CQP, we denote the circuit q according to normal | · | P. Each x ∈qp, x ̸ = 0, has a representation x = pγ (x0 +x1p +x2p2 +.) = Φ∑ i = 0 xi p i +γ, where x0 ̸ = 0, xi ∈Z, 0 ≤ XI <p, γ ∈Z. In this case, | x | p = p --γ and | 0 | p = 0. With this norm, Qp is again a field. Let bk (x0) = {x ∈ Qp: | x - x0 | p ≤ pk} and sk (x0) = {x ∈ Qp: S.S. Hair 95 | x - x0 | p = pk}. Since the additive group ofqp is locally compact, there is a Haara µ measure, such that µ (b0) = 1. for x = (x1,., Xn) ∈Qnp: = Qp × QP · · × QP and T ∈QP we introduce | x | p = max {| xi | p: 1 ≤ i ≤ n}, tx = (t x1,., t xn). BK balls (x) and spheres SK (x), k ∈Z are determined in the same way as with n = 1. The Haara µ measure is a product N of the corresponding measures. Space LQ (QNP), 1 ≤ Q <mm, consists of integrated measurable functions with the final norm ∥ f ∥q =  ´ qnp | f (x) | q dµ (x) 1/q. Next, 1/q+1/q ′ = 1. Distribution function η F measurable on q n p function F is set by equality η f (λ) = µ (& ∈Qnp: | f (x) |> λ}), λ λ λ λ λ λ λ λ λ λ λ) ≥ 0. The non -growing permissance F is the function F ∗, determined on R+ = [0, urb) with the formula f ∗ (t) = Inf {λ: η f (λ) ≤ t}, t ∈R+. Let 0 <q, s <∞. The space of the lorenz LQ, S (QNP) consists of all measurable functions F on QNP, for which ∥ f ∥q, s = (∞ mm 0 [t 1/q f ∗ (t)] s d t) 1/s <mm. If S = urb 1 ≤ Q ≤ care, then ∥ f ∥q, inous = Sup t> 0 T 1/Q F ∗ (t). Let T - the operator determined on LQ, 1 (QNP) and its values ​​are measurable on Q N P, 1 ≤ Q <و, 1 ≤ r ≤ moT. If T is limited from LQ, 1 (QNP) in L R, urb (QNP), then T is called the low -type operator (Q, R). An important role in the work is played by the Martsinkevich theorem. Theorem A. Suppose that 1 ≤ Q0 <q1 <°, 1 ≤ r0, r1, r0 ̸ = r1, θ ∈ (0.1) and 1/q = (1–θ)/q0 +θ/q1, 1, 1 /r = (1–θ)/r0 +θ/r1. If the operator T has weak types (Q0, R0) and (Q1, R1), then T is limited from LQ, S (QNP) in LR, S (QNP) for all 1 ≤ S ≤ least. On the spaces of the Lorentz, operators of a weak type and interpolation theorem of Martsinkevich see [2, ch. 4, § 4]. We introduce the following P-Addic analogue of the operator of the Hausdorf operator, considered in [3], hφ, ω (f) (x) = ˆ qnp φ (x | y | p) | y | np ω (y | y | p) f (y) dµ (y). Here, ∈ L1 (S0 (0)) and we consider the number | Y | P, equal to a certain degree P, as an element. We also determine the switch H Bpe, ω (F): = BHφ, ω (F) −hφ, ω (b f), where b ∈λβ (QNP) for some 0 <β≤ 1, i.e. ∥b∥λβ = sup {| b (x+h) −b (x) |/| h | β p: x ∈qnp, h ∈Qnp \ 0} <mm. 96 Materials of the International School-Conference The purpose of this work is to obtain sufficient conditions for assessments of strong and weak types for hya, ω in LQ (QNP) and for h b φ, ω from l q, s (qnp) in l r, s (qnp ). As long as the S0 (0) sphere has the same dimension as QNP, the methods used in the work differ from used in the case of RN (see [3] and [4]). Theorem 1. Let 1 ≤ Q <و, φ is radial, i.e. Φ (x) = onic (| x | p), where ∈ is determined in all PK and is constant on all (PK -1, PK], k ∈Z, ω ∈ LQ ′ (S0 (0)
