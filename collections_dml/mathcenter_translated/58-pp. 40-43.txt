Aleksandrov for metric spaces in the presented cases is not performed. The result is consistent with the work of other authors (see [4, 5, 6]). Literature 1. Bereestovsky V.N., Nikonorov Yu. G.

Keywords: Similarly Homogeneous Space, R-Tree, Metrics UDC 517.83 On some properties of discrete operators V.B. Vasiliev1, A.A. Khodyreva2 1 vbv57@inbox.ru; Belgorod State National Research University 2 711012@bsu.edu.ru; Belgorod State National Research University We consider discrete functions in the cone and investigate the properties of their discrete Fourier transformations. These properties are associated with the analyticity of the studied classes of functions in special areas of multidimensional integrated space. Keywords: discrete area, discrete conversion of Fourier, analyticity let D ⊂ Rm - a convex cone that does not contain a whole straight line, and ∗ D is a concrete cone to D, i.e. ∗ D = {x ∈RM: x · y> 0, y ∈ D}. V.B. Vasiliev, A.A. Khodyreva 41 Put DD = Hzm, H> 0, ħ≡ H - 1. We denote T (∗ D) ⊂CM set of the type ħtm+i ∗ D. For ħtm ≡ rm (h → 0), such many multidimensional integrated space are called radial tubular areas above the cone ∗ D [1]. We introduce the function BD (z) = ∑ x̃∈Dd ei x̃ · zhm, z = onic+ iτ, ă ∈ ħtm, τ ∗ D, and determine the operator (bd u) (₽) = lim τ τ ħtm bdm bdm bdm bdm bdm bdm bdm bdm bdm bdm bdm bdm (z −η) ud (η) dη. This operator is a conical analogue of Hilbert's periodic transformation [2.3,4]. Next, discrete analogues of the Schwartz S (HZM) and spaces of Sobolev - Slobetsk H s (HZM), H S (DD) are introduced [3.4]. On a discrete set of DD, the functions of a discrete argument UD are considered. Let pd: h s (hzm) → H s (DD) - projector on DD, i.e. ∀ud ∈ H s (hzm) (pd ud) (x̃) = {ud (x̃), x̃ ∈ DD, 0, x̃ ∉ DD Discrete converting Fourier is determined by the formula (fd ud) (perf) = ∑ x̃∈Hzm ei X̃ · Did (x̃) h m, ă ∈ ħ [−π, π] m. Lemma 1. For ud ∈ S (HZM) the following identity fd pd ud = bd fd ud proof is true. If you introduce the function χ (x̃) as a characteristic function of the discrete cone DD, then, obviously (pd ud) (x̃) = χ (x̃) ud (x̃). In order to apply the theorem about the bundle, we regulate the characteristic function χ (x̃) by the asshole EI X̃ · τ, τ ← D, so that the work χ (x̃) ei x̃ · τ is already an integrated function. Now you can use the theorem about the package for two functions χ (x̃) ei x̃ τ and ud (x̃). Remembering the definition of BD (Z) and the properties of a discrete transformation of Fourier, we get the statement of Lemma 1. N remark. It follows from Lemma 1 that the operator BD: l 2 (ħtm) → l2 (ħtm) is a line limited operator with a norm independent of h, it is equal to 1. Example 1. Let m = 2 and cone d is the first quadrant - this is the first quadrant On the flatness d = {x ∈R2: x = (x1, x2), x1> 0, x2> 0}, 42 “Lobachev readings - 2019” Then the corresponding periodic core BD (Z) has the form BD (Z1, Z2) = H2 4I CTG HZ1 2 CTG HZ2 2, and the corresponding operator looks as follows (τ = (τ1, τ2) ∈ D) (BD ũ) (Answers, lection) = h2 4i lite τ τ τ ħ ħπ ħπ∫ — ħπ∫ ħπ∫ ħħπ∫ CTG H (cil1 + iτ1 - t1) 2 ctg h (₽2 + iτ2 - t2) 2 ũ (T1, T2) D T1D T2. Calculations in a single case are given in [2]. Note that in our case, the cone D is self -integrated, i.e., D = ∗ D. Lemma 2. The function BD (Z) is analytical in the T (∗ D) region and satisfies the assessment∫ ħtm | BD (ă+ iτ | 2Durb C (h 1 - Hb | τ |) m, where the constant C does not depend on the evidence. COMPOSITIONS OF COSHI -Riman are checked directly. Next, we will use the arguments from [1]. According to the equality of the Parseval, we have ħtm | bd (ă+ iτ | 2D ing = 1 (2π) m ∑ x̃efa | ei x̃ · z | 2hm = 1 (2π) m ∑ x̃phical e - 2x̃ τ τhm = 1 (2π) m ∑ x̃∈Dd e -2 | x̃ | · | Τ | · cos � (˜, τ) xhm, where � (˜, τ) x denotes the angle between X̃ and τ.
