. The task of scattering for Schrödinger operator A. N. Galimov Bashkir State University, Ufa in L2 (R3) Consider the Schrödinger operator h = 3∑ k = 1 (pk + ak (x)) 2 + v (x), where PK = I −1∂/∂xk, a (x) = (x), a2 (x), a3 (x)) and v (x) - respectively, magnetic and electric potentials, and all potentials are material and satisfy the conditions ( i) (| φ (x) | + | a (x) |) ∈ L (r3), where φ (x) = a2 (x) + idiv a (x) + v (x), a2 (x) = 3∑ k = 1 a2k (x); 45 (II) for all Δ> 0 Functions Fδ (X) = ∫ | X --Y | 6δ | φ (Y) || X --Y | −1Y, GPA (X) = ∫ | X --Y | 6PA | A (y) || x - y | −2dy are limited in R3, and lim δ↘0 fδ (x) = lim Δ↘0 gδ (x) = 0 evenly in R3. The equation of Lippman - the Swinger with magnetic potentia is called the integral equation gment ffic (x, λ, ω) + ∫ r3 (4π | x - y |) −1eiλ | x --y | [φ (y) + 2 (λ | x - y | −1 + + i | x - y | −2) 〈x - y, a (y)〉] · supply (y, ω, λ) dy = eiλ 〈x, ω〉. (1) The solution ffic (x, λ, ω) of equation (1) will be called the problem of the problem of selection. Equation (1) with material λ has the only reinforcement if the homogeneous equation f +k (λ) f = 0, where k (λ) is an integral operator B (1), has only zero solution. We denote through E set of those points λ, = λ> 0, for which this homogeneous equation has a non -trivial solve. We introduce sets E1 = E ∩ {λ | = λ> 0}, e2 = e \ e1 \ {0}. It is proved that: 1. Under conditions (i) - (II) operator K (λ) compact and indifference, it was spent on λ in uniform operator topology in space C (R3). 2. Under conditions (i) - (II), the set of E2 does not have the final maximum points, and if λ 6 = 0, λ ∈ E2, then λ2 is the positive number of Schrödinger operator H 46 of the final multiplicity, and any corresponding own function F (x) for s ∈ [0, 2) allows the assessment of SUP X] (1 + | x |) 2 | f (x) | <Imes. 3. For λ ° 6 = 0 and λ ° ∈ E2, the limit is the limit onic (x, λ°, ω) = lim n → ger onic (x, λn, ω), uniform for x ∈ R3 and ω ∈ S2. L and T R A T R A 1. Murtazin H.Kh., Galimov A.N. Spectrum and scattering for Schrödinger operators with unlimited coefficients // Dokl. RAS. - 2006. - T. 407. - No. 3. - C. 413–432. The theorem of the regularity of descending in line-invariant families of the functions of E.G. Ganenkova Petrozavodsky State University, g_ek@inbox.ru The concept of a linearily forecasting family was introduced. Pommerenke [1] in 1964 and means that together with each function F from a certain family this family belongs to the function f (gment (z)) - f (gment (0)) f ′ (gment (0)) (0) = Z +. . . With any automorphism ∗ (z) of a single circle. For many such families, regularity theorems are known that characterize the procedure for the growth of the module of functions and its derivatives (see [2–6]). 47
