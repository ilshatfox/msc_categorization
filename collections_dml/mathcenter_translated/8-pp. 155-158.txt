) Line-invariant families of display of the ball and the Flea function in CN 155 The concept of a linear-invariant family (L.-I.S.) of analytical in the circle b = b1 = {z ∈ C: | z | <1} The functions were first introduced and studied by Pommerenka in [1]. The linear invariation of the family is locally single in B functions f (z) = z +. . .. means that, along with each function F ∈M, this family also belongs to the function F (φ (z)) - f (φ (0)) f ′ (φ (0)) φ ′ (0) = z + · · · · · With any conformal automorphism φ (z) circle B. One of the examples of L.-I.S. The class S class S is single and analytical in the circle B functions of the specified type. In 1997, in [2] the concept of L.-I.S. It was transferred to local billarfic display of a single ball BN, N> 1; B [2] studied L.-I.S. such display. It should also be noted that even earlier such a generalization was undertaken in [3] for the case of n = 2. Unfortunately, when the equality is withdrawn (5.3) in [2], a significant error was made. However, this false equality (5.3) formed the basis of evidence of some statements in [2], [4] (so, in [4] three of the six theorems are equipped with evidence based on equality (5.3)); Lempting equality (5.3) began to use other authors in their works. In [5], we have developed a method of lowering the dimension, which allows you to reduce tasks for L.-I.S. In the BN ball to the corresponding tasks in B1. With the help of this method, it was possible not only to correct evidence of theorems from [2], [4], but also to strengthen these theorems, as well as get new results. The most important example of L.-I.S. In BN is the KN family of all billarfic display F ball BN to convex areas in CN. For such display in [6], inequality (1 + || z ||) −2 ≤ || df (z) || was proved (1 + || z) ≤ (1 - || z ||) −2, z ∈ Bn, (1) it was stated that the equality here is achieved to display F (Z1,., Zn) = (1- Z1) −1 (Z1,. ., zn) ∈ KN. 156 with n = 1 inequality (1) is indeed accurate for each z ∈ B. Otherwise, the situation is with n ≥ 2; Here the equality in the left part (1) is achieved at the point Z = 0. However, at r = || z || ∈ (0, 0.917) We have received inequality 1 (1+R) 2 <(1- R) γn/n - (n+1)/n (1+r) γn/n+(n+1)/n ≤ | | Df (z) || ∀f ∈ KN, where γn = 1 + √ 2 (n - 1) 2. Moreover, it turned out that for accuracy in KN inequality of the type 1 (1 + || z ||) c ≤ || df (z) || It is necessary that C ≤ √ 2 + 2 - √ 2 n. Thus, the question of the exact lower assessment || DF (z) || in KN remains open for n ≥ 2. Our research in this direction leads to the hypothesis: 1 1 + || z || ≤ || df (z) || ∀f ∈ Kn, ∀z ∈ B N, N ≥ 2. The identified connection of L.-I.S. With a flea space, it allows you to transfer the obtained in L.-I.S. The results on the flea function. L and T R A T R A 1. Pommerenke ch. Linear-INVARIANTE FAMILEN ANALYTISCher FUNK Tionen.
