The frames of the gabab in the final spaces let the vector G = (G (O), G (L),. .., G (N - 1)) E C_N, K ~ N, T - Cyclic shift operator in c_n, i.e. Tg = t (g (o), g (l), .., g (n - 1)) = (g (n - 1), g (o), g (l), ..., g (N - 2)). Determination 1. empty g = (g (o), g (l), ..., g (n-1)) e cn. For t = o, 1, ..., n- 1 define n-1 · g (t) = l g (j) e-21rimj/n; j = o vector g = (g (0), § (1), ..., g (n - 1)) is called the discrete by the transformation of the truck. Statement 1. The system of vectors {tkg} 1;; ';: 0 1 image of the basis in c_n and then a crowd when g (t) =/o for t = o, 1 ,. .. n - 1. Let m - the modulation operator in c_n, defined by the crown of mg = m (g (o), g (l), ..., G (n - 1)) = = (w0g (o ), w1g (l), ..., WN -1G (n - 1)), where w = e27ri/ n. Statement 2. The system of vectors {m1g} {: 0 1 forms (orthonomated) basis in CN and Molko then Then, to Gda G (J) =/-O (G (G) = 1/VN) for j = o, 1 ,. .., n - 1. 166 m. BUT . Lapshina Determination 2. A set of elements {'pj} f = l 1.lz cn is called: J1Sestkuum by the frame for space CN, if there is a positive' number A, such that to li <x, tpj> 12 = a! Lxll 2 j = l for all x · from CN. Determination 3. Frame {'pj} _7 = 1 names is uniform, if there is a' number a, such, what Ij tpj 1! = And for any j = 1, ..., K. Determination 4. The Gabor system in CN is a system of vectors of the species {m1tkg}, where (l, k) e l with zi, zn is the class of VT'chetov according to RN. OD N. Theorem. For each vector, G =/= O from CN, the full gabor system {m1tkg} with L = ZJV forms a uniform hard frame with the framework of N! LGLL2. The frames of Gabor with L =/Z'JV are also built. Literature 1.
