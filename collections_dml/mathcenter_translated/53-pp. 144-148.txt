A study of the sustainability of the mathematical model of the dynamics of the population of seaweed by the stability and stability of ecological SIMM is possible by studying mathematical models used to describe the dynamics of environmental communications. The issues of sustainability are related to the issues of the rational operation of natural resources, the assessment of the limits of environmental pollution, as well as the forecast of the consequences of the anthropogenic impact on the environmental system [1]. The purpose of this study is to study the stability of the dynamic model that describes the processes of growth and development of algae biomass [2]:   ẋ ẋ ẋ (t) = µ (t) ∗ (s) x (t) (1– x (1– x (1– x t) xm) u, ṡ (t) = d (sn - s (t)) - µ (t) η x (t) onic (s); (1) I.V. Testova, N. A. Shilova 145 Where ẋ, ṡ is the rate of change in the biomass of algae and the end of the centralization of biogenic substances in the environment, ) = s (t)/(ks+ s (t)) - a trophic function of Moscow but, D is the coefficient of the duct, SN - the concentration of biogenic substances in the environment before the beginning of the growing season, η is the coefficient of the reflective, the reflecting grew algae to a unit of consumed biogenicity substances, XMAX - the maximum of WHO POY POSSIBLE IN THE BIOMAY of Algae. For the simplicity of solving the problem, we assume that µ (t) = const, ks, xmax, µ, d, sn, ηi, u> 0, and the system (1) will introduce in the form:   µ µ s ks + S x (1 - x xm) u = 0, d (sn - s) - µ η x s ks + s = 0. (2) we get two stationary points: 1. (0; SN), (3) 2. (3) 2. (3) 2. (3) XM; 0, 5 (√ (xmµ ηd + ks - SN) 2 + 4SNKS - xmµ ηD —KS + SN)). (4) To study the inpatient state of the system, whether the system (2) is in the vicinity of the equilibrium position by decomposing functions in a series of Taylor. The absence of limit cycles of phase trajectories was proved by the power of the Bendixon criterion. For this, about 146 I.V. Testov, N. A. Shilov, ∂f ∂x, ∂g ∂s, where: f = f (x, s) = µ S ks + s x (1 - x xm) u, g = g (x, s) = d (sn - s) - µ η x s ks + s, and it is shown that the expression ∂f ∂x + ∂g ∂s for any pair (x, s) ∈ ∈ R2 + It is sympathetic and different from zero. Indeed ∂f ∂x + ∂g ∂s <0, since [µ us ks + s (2 x xm - 1) + d + µx · ks (ks + s) 2]> 0 for any pair (x, s) ∈ R2+. Then, according to the Bendixon criterion, the system (2) does not have closed circuits trajectory. The absence of limit cycles allows you to explore the STEM, using the Linearization procedure in the vicinity of the balance of equilibrium. Linearized system (2) in the vicinity of the point is equal to this (3) in the first approximation, it has the form:    ẋ1 = µsn (ks + sn) x1, ṡ1 = −ds1 - µsn η (ks + SN) x1; (5) where {x1 = x 0 1 + x̃1, s1 = S 0 1 + S̃1, and X̃1, S̃1 - small increments of values ​​X1, S1 in the vicinity of the point (0; SN). Analysis of the roots of the characteristic equation of the system (5) showed that the equilibrium position (3) is an unstable saddle (Figure 1a). Similarly, it was shown that I.V. Testov, N. A. Shilova 147 The stationary point (4) of the system (2) is a stable UZ (Figure 1b). a) b) Fig. 1 Phase portrait of the dormant points of the system, an additional study of the stability of the equilibrium position was carried out using numerical meals, by varying the initial states of phase tracts of the effect near the equilibrium position. The results of a numerical analysis, which was implemented in the Delphi 7.0 environment, showed that special points (3) and (4) systems (2) are an unstable saddle and a stable node, respectively. The results obtained are of practical significance and can be used to determine the range of the stability of organisms in changing environmental conditions. Based on changes in sustainability indicators, the capabilities of the body of MOVs can be determined to changes in the changes in the biotic and abiotic factors of the environment.
