Estimates of the coefficients of the holomorphic functions T.V. Kasatkina then; Winsky State University The task of evaluating the coefficients in the decomposition of the holomorphic one fox in the circle R.: = {Z: 1z1 <\} functions .f (z) E, for many years, stimulated the development of new ideas and methods of geometry. theories of analytical functions. The parametric method, the internal variations of the chiffer-Goluzin, as well as the apparatus of formal exno-enencing, developed by Lebedev and Milin, Louis de Brange in 1984 to solve the problem of the coefficient in class S.
