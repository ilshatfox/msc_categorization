Let DN = {Z = (Z1,., Zn): | ZK | <1, k = 1, n}-a single polycryg in the N-dimensional integrated space CN, ~ p = (P1,., PN), 0 <pk <mm (k = 1, n).

The subspace l ~ p (DN), consisting of holomorphic functions in DN, we denote through h ~ P (DN), and from n-harmonic functions-through h ~ p (DN). Let, further, dα (ζ, z) = n∏ i = 1 αi + 1 π (1 - | ζi | 2) αi (1– ζizi) αi + 2, αi> −1, i = 1, n, zz , ζ ∈ Dn. Theorem. Let ~ p = (p1,., Pn), 0 <pk <mm (k = 1, n). Then the operator tα (f) (z) = ∫ dn dα (ζ, z) g (ζ) dm2n (ζ), z ∈ Dn, αi> 2/pi, i = 1, n, displays the space h ~ p (dn ) on h ~ p (dn), and || tα (f) || h ~ p (dn) ≤ const || g || h ~ p (dn). Note 1. In the case when ~ p = (p1,., Pn), where pk> 1, i = 1, n or 0 <pk ≤ 1, i = 1, n, this result is established in [1 ]. 233 Note 2. The result obtained allows you to get a full description of linear continuous functionals n ~ p (DN) in the conditions of the proven theorem.

Chistyakov (Nizhny Novgorod) selectors in the BV classes is devoted to the problem of the existence of selected variation selectors for multi -digit displays of limited variation. Let T are a non -empty multitude of material numbers and (x, d) - metric space. Record ∗ ∈ BV (t; x) means that for display pper: t → x is its variation vd (∗) = submink ∑m i = 1 d (onic (ti), onic (ti - 1)), where SUPM is taken for all the breakdown ă = {ti} mi = 0 ⊂ t sets T (here m is natural and ti -1 <ti, i = 1,., M). We denote through C (x) the family of all non -empty compact subsets X, endowed with the metric of Hausdorf d (a, b) = max {e (a, b), e (b, a)} for a, b ∈ C (x), where E (a, b) = supx∈A Dist (X, B) and DIST (X, B) = Infy edb D (X, Y). The selector of the multi -digit display f: t → c (x) is called this display f: t → c (x), which f (t) ⊂ f (t) for all t ∈ T; If with each T ∈ T the set F (T) consists of one element, then F is called a single -digit selector for f. Theorem 1 (generalized principle of choosing Helly [1] - [3]). The infinite family φ display from T to X is such that SUP intern (∗) <imes and the set {onic (t) | ∗ ∈ φ} is predictable in x with any t ∈ T, contains a sequence that is preoccupied on T to the metric D to a certain recess 234
