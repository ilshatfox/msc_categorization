) Multipliers and functionality of one -dimensional F -algebra n Log n multidimensional F -albur n logomed functions in the ball and polydiska is considered in [1] as a replenishment by invariant metric (1) of the association of multidimensional F -algebr I.I. Privalov, previously studied in [5]. This article establishes that in a one -dimensional case, when the ball and polydis pass into the circle on the complex plane, the scheme developed in [7] and [2] for some spaces containing N Log N is applicable to the N Log N space, which allows us to fully allows Describe linear continuous functionality in n log n and coefficient multipliers from n log n into the Hardy HP, p> 0. The results are used to establish accuracy of the estimates of uniform growth of functions from N Log N and their Taylor coefficients, as well as to identify some topological properties Space N Log N and Fresche spaces covering it. 1. Preliminary information. We denote the circle | z | <1 on a complex Z-plain symbol U, and its border | z | = 1 - symbol t. According to [1] the holomorphic in the function F belongs to the class n log ng if SUP 06R <1 ∫ π − ω (log (1 + | f (reiaw) dθ 2π < + φ, where ω (t) = t log (e + t), t> 0. In [1] inclusions hp ⊂ n q ⊂ n log n ⊂ n ⊂ n ⊂ n ⊂ n, p> 0, q> 1, with which the class n log n is associated with the classes of hard Hp, p> 0, Privalov n q, q> 1 (see [3]), Smirnova n ∗, Nevanlinn nvanlinn n ([4]) and class M, introduced in the 97th one case in [2], from where in particular ( See [4]) the existence of the radial boundary limits F ∗ (eiθ) = limr → 1– f (reiθ) each function f ∈ N Log N for almost all EI step ∈ T. B [1] in class N Log N is introduced invariant Metric ρ in the form ρ (f, g) = | f - g |, f, g ∈ N Log N, where | f | = ∫ π −π ω (log (1 + | f ∗ (eiθ) |)) dθ 2π, f ∈ N Log N, (1) and the properties of class N Log N are investigated as a functional space from which we will need the next two. Theorem A. Class N Log N forms F -spaces regarding metric ρ, disinfection in the metrics ρ is not weaker uniform convergence on the computer ktah in u, and for any function F of class n log n the function FR, 0 6 R <1, determined by equations of FR (Z) = F (RZ), Z ∈ U, converge at R → 1 - to the initial function f in metric ρ. The theorem B. For the arbitrary function f of class n log n, they are fairly uniform in θ ∈ [−π, π] assessment logs (1 + | f (reiison) 6 ω - 1 (| f | (1 + r) (1- r) −1), 0 6 r <1, ​​(2) and ω (log (1 + | f (reiaw)) = o ((1 + r) (1 - r) −1) for r → 1 -, (3) in which the symbol ω -1 denotes the function in the ω of the function. 2. Evaluation of the coefficients of the Taylor functions of the class N Log N. The purpose of this paragraph is to proof of the following assessment of the coefficients of Taylor of the functions of the class N Log N. Theorem 1. For the coefficients of the Taylor functions of the space N Log N, an asymptotic assessment of Log+ | An | = O (√ n/ log (e + n)) with n → ∞. (4) proof. Let the holomorphic in the circle of the function F satisfies the condition of the log (1 + m (f, r)) 6 ω - 1 (α (1 + r) (1– r) −1) with R0 6 R <1 (5) for some for some α> 0 and 0 6 r0 <1, where m (f, r) = max | z | = r | f (z) | (6) 98 and ω - 1 denotes a function reverse to the function ω (t) = t log (e + t), t> 0. According to Koshi inequalities, for the coefficients of Taylor, functions F are valuable LOG | An | 6 log m (f, r) - n log r, 0 <r <1, ​​n ∈ Z+. Hence the log | an | 6 ω - 1 (α (1 + r) (1– r) −1) - n log r, 0 <r <1, ​​n ∈ Z +. (7) We minimize the expression on the right in order, equating the components of the compliance with each other: ω - 1 (α (1 + r) (1– r) −1) = n log (1/r). (8) This equation at the interval (0, 1) has the only root R = Rn, and it is easy to notice that rn → 1 at N → °. Using the known equivalence, we see that ω - 1 (α 1 + rn 1 - rn) ∼ 2α (1- RN) log (e + 2α/(1 - rn) ∼ 2α (1– RN) log (E + 1/ (1- Rn) and n log (1/ rn) ∼ n (1 - rn) with n → φ. (9) from here and from equality (8) with r = rn we get 2α (1– RN) −1/ log (E + 1/(1 - Rn) ∼ n (1 - Rn) or (1– RN) −2/log (E + 1/(1 - RN)) ∼ n/(2α) for n → ∞. Since the function opposite to the function s = t2/ log (e + t), t> 0 is equivalent to S → + ger Functions √ S Log (E + S), then (1– RN) −1 ~ n log (e + n/2α)/2α or 1 - rn ∼ √ 2α/(n log (e + n)) with n → φ. So, substituting the value of R = Rn into the inequality, taking into account the equivalent (9) and the fact that both are composed in inequality (7) are equal, we get log | an | 6 bn ∼ 2 √ 2αn/ log (e + n) at n → φ. (10) If the function F belongs to the N Log N class, then for It is fair (theorem b) ω (log (1 + m (f, r)) = o ((1 + r) (1– r) −1) 99 for R → 1–, therefore constant α in the assessment ( 5) can be chosen as an arbitrarily small positive value. From inequality (10) then it should be that log+ | an | = O (√ n/ log (e + n)) with n → φ, which was required to prove. ¤ 3. coefficient multipliers from N Log N to HP (P> 0). Let F and H - two many holomorphic functions in the circle U. The numerical sequence (BN) n organo+ is called the coefficient multiplier from F H, if for any function F ∈ F with the decomposition f (z) = ger n = 0 anz n, z ∈ U, (11) there is a function h ∈ H once
