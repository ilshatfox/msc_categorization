SAMI ABDULLAH ABED 175  Sami Abdullah Abed  University of Diyala, samialbarkish@gmail.com  COMMUTATIVITY OF PROJECTIONS  Let H be a Hilbert space, B(H) be the algebra of all bounded  linear operators on H , B(H)pr be the set of all projections on H.  Let E be the unit of B(H) .  Lemma 1. Let f ∈ C[0, 1] , λ ∈ (0, 1) , and p, q ∈ M2(C)pr , then the equality f(λp+ (E − λ)q) = λf(p) + (E − λ)f(q) implies p+ q = E if and only if  f(λ)− f(0) λ  = f(1− λ)− f(1)  1− λ = f(1)− f(0) (1)  and for any µ ∈ (0, 1) \ {λ, 1− λ} either  f(µ) 6= µf(1) + (1− µ)f(0) (2)  or  f(1− µ) 6= (1− µ)f(1) + µf(0). (3)  Lemma 2. For each pair of projections p, q ∈ B(H)pr such that pq = qp , for λ ∈ (0, 1) , and for a continuous function f ∈ ∈ C[0, 1] such that the condition (1) holds  f(λp+ (1− λ)q) = λf(p) + (1− λ)f(q). (4)  Theorem 1. Let p, q ∈ B(H)pr , λ ∈ [0, 1] , and f ∈ C[0, 1] be such that the condition (1) holds and for any µ ∈ (0, 1)\{λ, 1−λ} either (2) or (3) holds. Then the equality (4) holds if and only if  pq = qp .  For some functions the implication  f(λp+ (1− λ)q) = λf(p) + (1− λ)f(q) =⇒ pq = qp    176 SAMI ABDULLAH ABED  can be obtained directly without using Theorem 1.  Example 1. Let f(x) = x(x− 1 3 )(x− 2  3 )(x− 1) . The equality  f( 1  3 p+  2  3 q) =  1  3 f(p) +  2  3 f(q) (5)  implies pq = qp .  Example 2. Let f(x) = x(x− 1 3 )(x− 1  2 )(x− 1) . The equality  f( 1  2 p+  1  2 q) =  1  2 f(p) +  1  2 f(q) (6)  implies pq = qp .  Theorem 1 provides a pathway to more complicated examples.  Example 3. The function f(x) = sin(2πx) satisfies the  conditions of Theorem 1. The equality (6) implies pq = qp .  Example 4. The function f(x) = sin(3πx) satisfies the  conditions of Theorem 1. The equality (5) implies pq = qp .  This work was supported by the Ministry of Higher Education  and Scientific Research of Republic of Iraq.  B I B L I O G R A P H Y  1. Bikchentaev A.M.
