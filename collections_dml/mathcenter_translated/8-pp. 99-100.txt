One assessment for hyperbolic nuclei of double integrals, let the Fourier converting the functions of two variables F (X, Y) 99 ∈ L (R2) is determined by the formula F̂ (S, T) = 1 (2π) 2 ∫ R2 F (X, Y) E - Y) E- I (sx+ty) dxdy. Of considerable interest is the question: under what conditions the function f (x, y) can be argued that at some point partial Fourier integrals on hyperbolic crosses converge to it, i.e. f (x, y) = lim r → µ ∫ gr f̂ (s, t) ei (sx+ty) dsdt, (1) where GR = {(s, t): | s | ≤ r2 and | t | ≤ min (r2, r2/| s |)}? Earlier, the author showed that when studying a similar issue for convergence in circles of Fourier integrals from the classes of Waterman λbv (R2), assessments of some integrals associated with the corresponding integral nuclei of the conductor play a very important role. Here we will give the obtained grades for hyperbolic integral nuclei. Lemma. Let R ≥ 1, IR (x, y) = ∫ gr ei (sx+ty) DSDT, and U> U ≥ 1/R and V> V ≥ 1/R. Then the following inequalities are fair | IR (u, v) | ≤ c1r 2 (r2uv) 3/4 and ∣∣∣∣∣∣ u∫ u v∫ v IR (x, y) dxdy ∣∣∣∣∣∣ ≤ c2 (r2uv) 3/4, where permanent C1 and C2 not The studies are supported by the RFFF (project 00-01-00042) and the program “Leading Scientific Schools” (project 00-15-96143).
