The shifts of the sequences of positive numbers are known to study the completeness of the systems of exterous monomas (in particular, the exhibit) is played by special integral functions of the exponential type, which turn into zero at least the follower of the indicators λ = {λn} nhern of this system . This means that the study of the geometric characteristics of the subsequent integrated numbers is important for obtaining the results relating to completeness. Work [1] and [2] so far they call that the upper density of n̄ (λ), the maximum density N̄0 (λ), as well as the upper logarithm “block” density l̄ (λ) of the positive followed by the following way are of great importance : n̄ (λ) = lim t →+φ 1 t ∑ λn6t 1 = lim n →+φ n λn, n̄0 (λ) = lim Δ → 0+0 lim t →+nder 1 δt ∑ (1–δ) t <λn6t 1, l̄ (λ) = lim a →+و lim t →+φ 1 ln a ∑ t <λn6at 1 λn. Our study is as follows. Let m = = {µn} n∈N and λ = {λn} norn - non -layered sequences of positive numbers with the only limiting point +urb, associated with the ratio λn = µn --αn, where αn> 0. Suppose that the limit of Lim N →+α αn µn (1) 130 Z. Z. Rizvanov, E. I. Fazleeva exists and is equal to A 6 1. Theorem. If (1 - a) 2 + (l̄ (m) 2 6 = 0, then the following formulas are true: n̄ (λ) = n̄ (m) 1 - a, n̄0 (λ) = n̄0 (m) 1 - a, L̄ (λ) = l̄ (m) 1 --a. L and T R A T R A 1. Malliavinp., Rubel L.A.

The solution of problems acts as a goal and as a means of training. The ability to compose and solve problems is one of the main indicators of the level of development of students.
