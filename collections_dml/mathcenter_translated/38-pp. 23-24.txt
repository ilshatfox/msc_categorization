Asymptotic solutions of the problem of convective diffusion outside the drop if there is a chemical reaction, the marginal task 2 1 (d · f d'lj; di) with di - 1 · 2 sin8 dv dr - dr dv - µf (u) = o, · and = and = and = and = and = · and = O, r = 1; · And-> 1, t-> oo, (1) (2) where D is the operator of Laplace, · F (R, B), F (I)-specified functions, e> o-a small parameter. Task (1), (2) occurs when a study of convective diffusion of a spherical drop, which is established by the progressive stream of a viscous incompatible fluid in the presence of a voluminous chemical reaction (see, for example, [1], chap. 5, formulas (6.1) - (6.3)). With such an interpretation, E - 2 = re - the number of pacle, 'lj; (r, c) - current function, · 1 ·, () 24 r. G. Akhmetov spherical coordinates. Function F (U) - the speed of chemical reaction. The numberµ = kv/pE, where KV is a chemical reaction speed constant. At the same time, the numbers K, "rex to the demon of the limb, and µ is limited. The task similar to the task (1), (2), in the case of the resulting particle, was studied in the work of [2] in the coordination of asymptotic decays [3]. In character, a peculiarity is a peculiarity. The problem under consideration is the presence of special points such as the saddle on the border of the region. The task is bisingular in nature (see definition in work [3]). The report gives an overview of the main results of the author on this topic. In particular, the case is considered when F (O) = O, f '(O) #O. Work was performed under the financial sub-holder of the RFFIF (about ECT 09-01-00530) · And the Presidential Programs "Leading Scientific: Schools of the Russian Federation" (project NSh-2215.2008.1).
