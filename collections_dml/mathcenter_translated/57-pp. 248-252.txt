Nasibullin1 1 nasibullinramil@gmail.com; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.I. Lobachevsky proved new geometric versions of the inequalities of the Hardi-Rellich type, the weight functions of which contain the function of the distance to the boundary of the region ω ∈ Rn, the diameter and volume of the area ω, as well as the pseudo-dodium. The resulting inequalities bind the function and its private derivatives of the first and second orders in the integral ratio. We prove the inequalities in arbitrary and regular areas, in areas that satisfy the condition of the θ-cone, as well as in convex areas. Keywords: Hardy inequality, Rellich inequality, Best, Lamba constant, Laplace operator, Distance function, additional term. This work is devoted to spatial inequalities such as Hardirellich in the areas of ω Euclidean space rn, ω ̸ = rn. The inequality considered contain the function of the distance to the border ∂ω region ω, the diameter and volume of theω. We denote through C 10 (ω) the family of continuous-differentiated functions F: ω → R with a compact media in ω. It is known that if ω is a convex area, then for any function F ∈C 10 (ω) the following inequality of hardy ω | ∇ f (x) | 2D x ≥ 1 4 ∫ ω | f (x) | 2 δ (x) 2 d x, (1) where ∇ f is the gradient of the function f and δ (x) - the function of the distance from point x ∈ to the boundary of the region ∂ω, i.e. δ (x) = inf yphm∂ω | x - y |. R.G. Nasibullin 249 Extensive literature is devoted to various generalizations and modifications of inequality (1) (see, for example, [1] - [6] and literature in it). Note that the ratio (1) connects the function and its private derivatives of the first order. On the other hand, the inequalities of the Rehelikh associate the function with its private derivatives of the second order. If ω ⊂ rn is a convex area, moreover, ω ̸ = rn, n ≥ 1, then for any function f ∈Curb (ω) there is an inequality of relech∫ ω | ∆ f (x) | 2d x ≥ 9 16 ∫ Ω | f (x) | 2 Δ (x) 4 d x, where ∆ is the Laplace operator. In the articles [2], [3], [6], [9], [10] and [14], more detailed information about the development and modifications of inequalities of the type of relic. Inequalities connecting private derivatives of the first and second orders are known. For example, in [14] it is proved that if n ≥ 5 and f ∈C root (rn), then ∫ rn (∆ f (x)) 2D x ≥ n 2 4 ∫ rn | ∇ f (x) | 2 | x | 2 d x. Constant N2/4 is the best. As we already mentioned above, the inequalities of Hardy and Relalikha were generalized and the Moscow Region were distinguished in various directions. For example, one of the methods of generalization is the addition of an additional component to the corresponding inequality of Hardy or Rellich ([6], [7], [10], [11], [12]). Next, we give one example of inequality with additional terms. Let F ∈C 20 (ω). Then there is an inequality ∫ ω | ∆U (x) | 2D x ≥ 9 16 ∫ ω | u (x) | 2 δ (x) 4 +k n (n +2) (| SN -1 | n | ω | ) 4 n ∫ ω | u (x) | 2D x, (2) where k ≈ 1.25, ω is a convex region in RN, | SN -1 | -surface area N-Mortal Single spheres-1 and | ω | - The volume of the area. The last inequality was proved in [10]. We add that in [10] inequalities of the type of hard and relech in the 11 region were also obtained, which include pseudo -diagnosis instead of the function of the distance to the boundary of the region. The natural question is whether the inequality connecting the function with its private derivatives of the first and second orders is true. We give a positive answer to this question. To begin with, we will introduce some designations. Let the pans-the convex region BRN (n ≥ 2), | SN-1 | surface area of ​​the n-dimensional single sphere SN-1, | ω | - the volume of the region ω, γ - gamma Euler and D (ω) function - diameter ω. Suppose that b (n, s) = γ (s+1 2) γ (n 2) p πγ (n+s 2), k (q): =   (1–2 1 q - 2–1-1 ) 2–q, 0 <q <2, 1, 2 ≤ Q <3. We also put that 0 <q ≤ 3, ν≥ 0 and f ∈C 20 (ω). If ν midfields 1/q and n ≥ 4–q, then the values ​​of the school-conference of the Liva are the following inequality of the type of Hardi-Rellic 1 N (N +2) ∫ ω | ∆U (x) | 2D x + ν 2Q2 −1 4n ∫ ω | ∇u (x) | 2 δ (x) 2 d x ≥ Q2λ2ν (2/q) (3–q) 2 16 (2 d (ω) q b (n, 4–q) ∫ Ω | u (x) | 2 δ (x) 4–q d x +24 --q k (q) (sn - 1 n | ω |) 4–q n ∫ ω | u (x) | 2d x  , (3) And if ν ∈ [0.1/q] and n ≥ 4–q, then the following OC takes place
