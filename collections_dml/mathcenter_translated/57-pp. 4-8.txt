Guskova 5 Let them fix M ∈ N and α ∈ R, M −1 <α≤ M. The task of the type of koshi is considered (dα -k-1a+ x) (a) = 0, k = 0, m −1, (1) for the fractional-radical equation of the species (dαa+ x) (t)+ m∑ k = 1 gk (t) (d α --k a+ x) (t) = y (t), − music <a <t ≤ b ≤+ φ, (2) where the functions are GK (t), k = 1, m, y ( t) - famous, x (t) - desired; (DβA+x) (t) there is a left -sided derivative of the riman -liville of the fractional order β from the function X (t) (see, e.g., [1, p. 44]). Note that the task (1), (2) is closely related to the task of Koshi Z (K) (A) = 0, K = 0, M −1, (3) for the differential equation Z (M) (t)+ m∑ k = 1 gk (t) z (m --k) (t) = y (t), a <t ≤ b. (4) Let lp ≡ lp (a, b), 1 ≤ p <mm, - the space of functions integrated according to the Lebeg on [a, b] with the degree p, with the norm ∥z∥p = {b∫ a | z ( t) | p d t} 1/p, z ∈ LP. By linger ≡ linger (a, b) we mean the space C [a, b] continuous on [a, b] functions with a conventional Max-Norm. We will assume that the known functions GK (t), k = 1, m and y (t) belong to the space y = lp ≡ lp (a, b), 1 ≤ p ≤ least. Then the task (1), (2) can be considered in a pair of spaces (X, Y) of the desired elements and right parts, order α from the function from lp: f (t) = (iαa+ng) (t) ≡ 1 γ (r −1+α) t∫ a x (τ) dτ (t –τ) r - α, r = [α α α. ] +1, γ (·)-Gamma Function of Euler. We set the norm in space X, having agreed with the corresponding norm in Y: ∥x∥x = ∥x∥p +∥iαA +x∥p, x ∈ X. In the selected pair (x, y), the task (1), (2) is equivalent to the operator equation k x ≡gx +t x = y (x ∈ X, y ∈ Y), (5) where the operator g: x → y, determined formula (gx) (t) = (dαa+x) (t), x ∈ X, 6 Materials of the School-Conference is continuous and has a continuous reverse, and the operator t: x → y, (t x) (t) = m∑ k = 1 gk (t) (d α --k a+ x) (t), x ∈ X, is quite continuous. Thus, the equation (5) in the selected pair of spaces (x, y) is an equation leading to the equation of the second kind with a completely continuous operator [2], to which the theory of Fredgolm is applicable. From this follows the correct setting in the sense of Adamar of the original task (1), (2) in a pair of spaces (x, y), if the task (3), (4) has the only solution for any right side of Y. In the future, without any reservations, we will assume the unambiguous resolution of the corresponding task (3), (4). Let h (r +µ) p, r +1 ∈ N, µ ∈ (0.1], 1 ≤ p ≤ accord, - a class of functions f (t) defined on [a, b] and having a production
