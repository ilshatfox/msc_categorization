UDC 517.542 Continuous fractions and conformal display P.N. Ivanshin1 1 pivanshi@yandex.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University in the work provides a method for constructing fractional-polynomial conformal displays of a single circle on the area with corner points. Key words: conformal display, fractional-polynomial function, convergence. The work has one auxiliary method for constructing a close conformal display of a single circle to a single -copper area. The design built here complements [1], [3]. Recall that in [1] the authors construct an approximate polynomial conformal display of a single circle D to some single -single area b. The method of constructing an approximate conformal display of the ring to the double region, see [2]. The main result is that built with continuous fractions (similar, but not coinciding with the sequence of fractionalnopolinomy functions [4], [5]), the display brings the square root in the complex right -wing half -plate. To approach fractional degrees, we consider the representation of z k n = z k - 11n + z - z k - 1 n z n - k n +. . .+ z 2n+ z 1n +1 For example, for z1/3 we get for F1 (Z) = 1+ Z -1Z+ 1 FN (Z) = 1+ Z −1 Z FN -1 (Z)+ FN -1 (Z) +1 Lemma. For FN (Z) and Z C re [z]> 0 The following facts are performed: 1. Re [fn (z)]> 0 2. Im [fn (z)] has the same sign as IM [z]. 3. The ratio of IM [fn (z)] re [fn (z)] has the same sign as IM [z] re [z], but ∣∣∣ im [fn (z)] re [fn (z) ] ∣∣∣ <∣∣∣ Im [z] re [z] ∣∣∣. Theorem. There are no points in the right complex half -plane in which the derivative of FN (Z) is zero. Statement. Fun (z) functions converge to zk/n for re [z]> 0, | z | <1. Literature 1.

Agafonov2 1 ignatev-yurii@mail.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University 2 A.A.Agathonov@gmail.com; Kazan (Volga) Federal University based on a qualitative analysis of cosmological models with phantom scalar fields with self -activity identified and clarified their distinctive features. Key words: phantom scalar field, quality analysis. The function of the lambgange of the phantom scalar field with mass M and by self -use has the form: l = - 1 8π (g i kφ, iφ, k + m2φ2 + α 2 φ4), where the α is the constant of self -activity. We will write out the self-composed equations of the spatial-flat cosmologic model D S2 = D T 2 —A2 (T) (D X2 +D Y2 +D Z2)-Einstein equation 3 ȧ2 A2 = −φ̇2 +m2φ2 +α 2 φ4 +λ (1) and The equation of a massive phantom scalar field with cubic nonlinearity: φ̈+3 ȧ a φ̇ --m2 ∗ φ = 0.
