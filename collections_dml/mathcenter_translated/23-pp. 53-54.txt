The decomposition of the semi -resistant algebra of the associative type in the works [1], [2] was introduced into consideration of the Lievsky -type algebra class. Let us give its definition. Let G-a switching group, l-G-g-sorted algebra above the field K, i.e., l = ⊕αă cho lα, t ⊂ g, | t | <Mm and lαlβ ⊆ lα + β, if α + β ∈ T, and lαlβ = 0, if α + β 6] We will say that l is the Lyevsky -type algebra, if for any α, β, γ ∈ T are such λ = λ (α, β, γ), µ = µ (α, β, γ) ∈ K, λ 6 = 0 = 0 that if a ∈ Lα, b ∈ Lβ, C ∈ Lγ, then (AB) C = λA (BC) + µb (AC). If µ = µ (α, β, γ) = 0 for any α, β, γ ∈ T, then the algebra L will be called the algebra of the associative type. Just as for associative algebra, an ultimately algebra of the associative type will be called semi -resistant if it does not have inilpotent ideals, and simple, if it does not have non -trivial bilateral ideals. Theorem. The ended-free semi-industrial G-gorduated algebra AC 55 of the social type above the field of zero characteristics with a completely ordered group G is a direct sum of simple ideals.

Mazurov (Novosibirsk, Mazurov@math.nsc.ru) On the locally free action of endless groups, BE - a group acting on the additively recorded Abel group V. They say that G acts freely on V if VG 6 = V for 0 6 = V ∈ V, 1 6 = G ∈ G. The known Tsassenhaus theorem gives the classification of the final groups that can act freely on the non -trivial abele group. In [1], this theorem was distributed from the final groups to groups in which any two conjugated elements of a simple order generate the final subgroup. Significant progress was achieved in [2], where it is proved that the periodic group generated by elements of about three and acting freely on the non -trivial Abel group is finite. The work [3] shows that the condition for frequency in this result can be loosened to the condition of the limb of the order of the switch of any two conjugated elements of the order 3. Finally, in [4] the result of [2] mentioned above is generalized when the condition of freedom of action is applied only On subgroups generated by two conjugated elements of a simple order. The next result significantly expands the class of the studied groups due to the weakening of the condition imposed on 2-sorrower subgroups. TEOREMA 1. Let G - a group acting exactly on the Abel group V. Suppose G is generated by such a class X of the conjugated elements of about 3 that any two elements X, Y from X are either double -halved, or generate a periodic subgroup acting freely on V. Then G is either a cyclic group of about 56
