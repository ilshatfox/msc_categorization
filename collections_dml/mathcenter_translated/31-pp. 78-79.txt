. Invariant equipment in the sense of E. Kartan and E. Bortolotti regular unliped hyperpolosa N. A. Kuzmina Chuvash State Pedagogical University, Cheboksary, Stolyarovav@chgpu.edu.ru we will consider the n-dimensional projective space PN. Hyperpolosomic distribution of M-somnic linear elements H (m <n-1) (that is, non-elonononal hyperpolos) is called [1] pair of distributions of the first kind, namely, the distribution of M-dimensional linear elements (a0, πm) and the distribution of hyperplioscopic elements (a0 , Πn -1) with the ratio of incidents: a0 ∈ πm ⊂ πn -1. In the first -order rhe, the differential equations of hyperpolosa distribution H have the form [1]: ωni = λ n ikω k 0; ω v i = λ v ikω k 0; ω n v = a n vαω α 0; ω i v = n i vkω k 0; i, j = 1, m; v = m + 1, n - m - 1; K = 1, n; Here, each of the sets of functions {λnij}, {anuv} forms a first -order tensor. Hyperpolosa distribution H with the field of unpertured tensors λnij, a n uv is called regular [1]. The differential surroundings of the 1st and 2nd orders determine the fields of quasiTins Avn Def = (1/M) λvijλ Ji n A 0 V Def = (1/M) N IVI 78, respectively, the first and second order. It is shown [1] that the regular hyperpolos distribution of the M-dimensional elements H in the second differential surroundings induces the projective space P̄n, the dual source space PN regarding involving transformation I: ωk̄ j̄ → ω̄k̄ J̄ of the Pfaff structural forms. The task of regular distribution H in PN induces [1] diversity h̄ in p̄n, dual source, and its differential equations in the tangential rover {ăj̄} have a form similar to the underpammon of H. Hyperpolosa Distribution of M-dimensional elements is called E. Kartan equipped in the sense of E. Kartan [2], if each center A0 is placed in line with the plane NN - M -1 (A0) of the dimension N - M -1, which does not have common points with the current element πm (A0) of the basic distribution. Equipping hyperpolos distribution H in the sense of E. Kartan is equivalent to the assignment on the sub -image of h fields of geometric objects {νin}, {νin, ν0n, avn}, {—A0v}. At the same time, in each center A0 distribution, the equipping plane NN - M -1 (A0) intersects the characteristic πn -m -1 (A0) along the first axis of Koenigs NN - M -2 (A0) of the sub -image H in its center A0. The hyperpolosa distribution of M-Merged linear elements H is called E. Bortolotti equipped in the sense of E., if each center A0 of the sub-forming H is in accordance with the hyperploster NN-1 (A0), not passing through point A0. Hyperploster NN -1 (A0) is set by equations ν0i x i + µ0vx v + µ0nx n - x0 = 0. Since the coverage ν0v = –A0V determines the field of the first axis of the Koenigs nn - m - 2 (a0) ⊂ πn --m -1 (a0 ) distribution h, then by duality coverage (ā ā0v) = anwva w n determines the field (m + 1)-dimensional 79
