Estimates of the amounts of Fourier -Haara coefficients let V (0, 1) - the space of all functions that have limited variation on the segment [0, 1], the function F belongs to V (0, 1). Let {an (f)} mmn = 1 - Fourier factors Fourier F according to the Haar system {χn} و = 1, and v 10 F - its complete variation on the segment [0, 1]. P. L. Ulyanov proved that a series φ∑ n = 2 | an (f) | γ converges at γ> 2/3 for any function F ∈ V (0, 1), and that the function is F0 ∈ V (0, 1) such that φ∑ n = 2 | an (f0) | 2/3 = inous (see [1], p. 533, theorem 5 '). In this work, for each γ from the gaps 1 ≤ γ ≤ 1.5 and γ ≥ 2, the exact constants c me are found in the assessments (φ∑ n = 2 | γ) 1/γ ≤ cγv 10 f (1) for Functions F, having the final and different from zero complete variation. A special case γ = 1 is considered by the author earlier in the work [2]. This article also received estimates from above and below for Cγ for the rest γ> 2/3. The main results are formulated in the following theorems. Theorem 1. Let γ0 - (only) root of the equation 5γ + 2γ/2 - 4γ - 23γ/2 = 0, lying in the gap 1 <γ <1.5. 1) at 1 ≤ γ ≤ γ0, the value of cmb is calculated according to the formula cγ = √ 2 3 (2γ/2 - 1) 1/γ, and the equality in the inequality (1) is achieved on function f (t) = {0 {0 ≤ t ≤ 1/3; 1 at 1/3 <t ≤ 1. 2) with γ0 ≤ γ ≤ 1.5 is true formula cmb = 1 12 ((5γ + 2γ/2) (2γ/2 - 1) + 23γ/2 2 2 2 - 1 - 1 ) 1/γ, 68 A equality B (1) is achieved on the function G (t) = {0 at 0 ≤ T ≤ 5/12; 1 at 5/12 <t ≤ 1. 3) with γ ≥ 2, the following is performed: cγ = 1/2, and on the functions χ2 (t) =   1 at 0 ≤ T <1/2; −1 at 1/2 <t ≤ 1; 0 with t = 1/2 equality B (1). Theorem 2. 1) at 2/3 <γ <1, the assessment of max {√2 + 2 3 is fair; 21/2 2 (23γ/2 - 2) 1/γ} ≤ cmb ≤ 21/γ 2 (23γ/2 - 2) 1/γ. 2) at 1.5 <γ <2, the inequality is correct 0.5 <cmb ≤ 1 12 (5 √ 5 + 1 7 (15 4 √ 8 + 16 √ 2 + 4 4 √ 2 + 8)) 2/3 ≈ 0 , 6107.
