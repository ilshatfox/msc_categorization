Integral equations for determining the function of Riemann in [1] for the UXXY + AUXX + Buxy + Cux + Duy + EU = 0 equation, the solution of the gurs problem in terms of Riemann function, which is defined as a solution to an integral equation containing single and two -time integrals. Here, using the work methodology [2], [3], sufficient conditions have been obtained to record integral equations for the function of Riemann, not containing single integrals. Let D ≡ bx, C ≡ ab + 2ax, then the function of Riemann V satisfies the equation V (X, Y, X0, Y0) = Exp  Y∫ Y0 A (X0, β) Dβ  + B (X0, Y0) x∫ x0 r (x0, y0, α, y) dα + + y0 x∫ x0 α∫ x0 r (α1, β, α, y) hv (α1, β) dα1dαdβ, h = e - e - e - e - e - e - e - e - (Ax + AB) X, R (X, Y, X0, Y0) = EXP   x0∫ x b (α, y0) dα + y0∫ y a (x, β) dβ  . If D ≡ bx, C ≡ ab + Ax + By, then V (X, Y, X0, Y0) = Exp   y∫ y0 a (x0, β) dβ  + b (x0, y0) x∫ x0 R1 (x0, y0, α, y) dα + + y0 x∫ x0 α∫ x0 r1 (α1, β, α, y) kv (α1, β) dα1DαDαDαDαDαDαDαDαDαDαDαDαDαDαDαDαDαDαDαDαDαDαDαDαDAK, K = E - (by + AB) X , R1 (X, Y, X0, Y0) = Exp   x0∫ x b (α, y) dα + y0∫ y a (x0, β) dβ  . 168 The resulting integral equations allow you to build a Riemann function for the UXXY + A (Y) UXX + E (Y) U = 0 in the following form V (X, Y, X0, Y0) = Exp  Y∫ Y0 A (β) dβ    1 - φ∑ k = 0 1 k!   y0∫ y e (β) dβ  k (x0 - x) 2k (2k)!  . 169 L and T R A T R A TALALOV V.

Mukharlyamov (Moscow) Construction of the equation of the dynamics of a given structure The task of constructing systems of differential equations, the solutions of which would have the indicated properties, has an ambiguous solution. The analytical expression of the properties of solutions can be different. The general structure of systems of differential equations, the first or private integrals of which are set, is known. The right parts of the desired system contain arbitrary functions, the choice of which can be controlled by the direction of movement in the variety determined by the specified integrals, and in its environs. This allows us to ensure the stability of the variety, the required distribution of the trajectory family in this area, the necessary accuracy of the execution of the equations of relations with a numerical solution and other properties. The reverse tasks of dynamics are also reduced to the construction of systems of differential equations. Modern setting of reverse tasks of dynamics involves constructing the equations of the movement of the system in one form or another. According to the well -known structure of the system of differential equations, the corresponding functionality is determined, which takes stationary value on the solutions of the system. To compose the equations of movement of the required structure, which would describe movements with given properties, successfully use the methods of building differential 170
