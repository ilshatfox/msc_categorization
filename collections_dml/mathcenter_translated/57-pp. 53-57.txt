Integral Formulas When Finding the Temperature Distribution in the Prince of Sudden Heating of the Surface of a non-uniform Half-Space V.B. Bednova This Article Presents The Solution Method of the Temprature Problem of the Sudden Heating of the Depth Half-Space Surface. We use integral formulas that allow us to obtain the solution of the original problem for an equation with variable coefficients depending on coordinates and time, by solving the same problem for an equation with constant coefficients.

UDC 517.929 A new approach in the existence of periodic solutions for the functional-radical equations of the point type L.A. Beklarian1, A.L. Beklarian2 1 lbeklaryan@outlook.com; Central Economic and Mathematics Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow 2 Abeklaryan@hse.ru; National Research University “Higher School of Economics”, Moscow Report is dedicated to the Functional and differential equations of the CHILDERTIP ẋ (t) = f (t, x (q1 (t),., X (qs (t)), t ∈ BR where f: where f: where f: where f: where f: where F: R × rns - → rn - display of class C (0); q j (·), j = 1,., S - straight homeomorphisms, preserving orientation; BR - closed interval [T0, T1], closed numerical half -rectifier [T0 ,+Φ [, or numerical direct R. Keywords: functional-radical equations of a point type, initial-stringular problem, solitone solutions, periodic solutions. The importance of the equations of the type under consideration is determined by the fact that the theory of solutions of the functional-dispersed equations of the point type is closely connected with The theory of solutonic solutions for endlessly ordinary differential equations [2]. The approach proposed for the study of such equations is based on formalism, the central element of which is constructions that use of course the generated group Q = <Q1,., Q. S> 54 Materials of the School-Conference of Homeomorphisms of Direct (Group operation in such a group is superposition of homeomorphisms). Using the replacement of time, for the functions of the rejection of the argument [Q j (t) - t], j = 1 ,. . . , S can always achieve the fulfillment of the condition h = max iorn {1, ..., s} h J <+ger, h j = sup tgr | q j (t) - t |, j = 1,. . . , s. The main goal in the study of the functional-differential equations of the point type is the study of the initial-stringly task ẋ (t) = f (t, x (q1 (t),., X (QS (t)), t ∈ Br (1) ẋ (t) = onic (t), t ∈R \ Br, ∗ (·) ∈ Linger (R, RN), (2) x (t̄) = x̄, t̄ ∈R, x̄ ∈RN, (3) which we will call the main initial-stringent task. In a situation of the general position, when t̄ ̸ = t0, t1, or the deviations of the argument are arbitrary, we have a task with non-cutting initial-root conditions. Another important class of tasks is associated with the study of periodic and limited Solutions for the initial functional-differential equation of a type of type, determined on a straight line. We determine the bananah space of functions x (·) with Libra l nµc (k) (r) = {x (·): x (·) ∈C (K) (r) (r) (r) (r) (r) (r) (r) (r) (r) (r) Rn), max 0≤r≤k sup tgr ∥x (t) µ | t | ∥rn <+و}, µ ∈ (0.1), and the norm ∥x (·) ∥ ( k) µ = max 0≤r≤k sup tgr ∥x (t) µ | t | ∥rn. We formulate a system of restrictions on the right part of the functional -differential equations of the point type: (a) f (·) ∈C (0) (r × rn × s, rn) (in condition (a) function F (·) according to a variable T, you can put a piece of line with the first kind of ruptures at the points of a discrete set); (b) Condition of quasilineous growth: for any t, z j, z̄ j, j = 1 ,. . . , s ∥ f (t, z1,., ZS) ∥RN ≤ m0 (t)+m1 s∑ j = 1 ∥z j∥rn, m0 (·) ∈C (0) (r, r), and r), and Condition of the lipper ∥ f (t, z1,., ZS) - f (t, z̄1,., Z̄s) ∥RN ≤ m2 S∑ j = 1 ∥z j - z̄ j∥rn (actually m1 ≤ m2 , but the constants M1 and M2 can be taken equal); L.A. Beklarian, A.L. Beklard 55 (C) exists µ ∗ ∈R + such that expression SUP IPO M0 (T + I) (µ ∗) | I | For any T ∈ R, it has the final value and as the function of the argument T is continuous. Theorem 1. [1] If for some µ ∈ (0, µ ∗) ∩ (0.1) the inequality M2 S∑ J = 1 µ --h J <Lnµ-1, then with any fixed initial-stringed conditions x̄ ∈Rn , ∗ (·) ∈ Lux (R, Rn) there is a solution (absolutely continuous) x (·) ∈L nµc (0) (R) the main initial-stringular task (1)-(3). Such a solution is the only one as the element of the space nµc (0) (r) continuously depends on the initial-string conditions onic (·) ∈ Linger, X̄ ∈RN and the right part of the equation-function F (·). Periodic solutions of the equation ẋ (t) = f (t, x (t +n1),., X (t +ns)), t ∈R, (4) the right part of which periodic in time with the period ω. Without violating the community, we will assume that n1 ≤. . . ≤ ns ≤ ω. For clarity, when presented, we limit ourselves to the case when the values ​​of the deviations of the argument N1 ,. . . , NS and the period ω of the right side of the equation by a variable time are comparable. In this case, without violating the community, we can assume that the values ​​of N1 ,. . . , NS, ω are integer. The last property can be achieved by replacing time of the type of stretching. Cf.
