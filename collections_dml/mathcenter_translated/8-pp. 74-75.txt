The local properties of harmonic display, let D is the area of ​​the complex plane C, W = F (Z): D → C - harmonic display. The point z0 ∈ D is called a special point of display f if in any its surroundings F is not bunctional [1]. A necessary and sufficient condition for the presence of features at point Z0 is the appeal to the JF JF (Z) = | fz | 2– | fz̄ | 2 display f at this point. The isolated zero of Jacobian is answered by the branching points - special points of the unstable type. In the theory of disasters, stable features of smooth display of Euclidean spaces are classified. In the two -dimensional case, only two types of stable features are conveyed - the folding points and the assembly point. Of particular complexity is a description of the behavior of non -overgrown harmonic display (for such Displays JF is not equal to zero) in the vicinity of the uninsulated zero of Jacobian. It is proposed different from [1] a method based on the properties of the Hopf differential pper СDZ 2 = fzfzdz2, associated with a harmonic display f. The zero JF JF JF JFs, unpertured into the points of JF, are analytical curves and are called common folds of display f. The orthogonal trajectory of the holomorphic quadratic 74th differential uction ∗dz2 is called the analytical curve, along which the differential inequality isingz2 <0. Theorem [2] is performed. Let Z0 be the uninvited zero of the Jacobian of the unbearable harmonic Corry, resistant display f. Point Z0 is a folding point (assembly point) for F then and only when the total display folder F and orthogonal trajectory of the HOPF pper СFDZ 2 differential, passing through point Z0, intersect transversally (respectively) at the point Z0. The local properties of unused harmonic display, which are not Cinger, resistant, are much more complicated. The main attention in the report is given to this case. L and T R A 1. Lizzaik A.
