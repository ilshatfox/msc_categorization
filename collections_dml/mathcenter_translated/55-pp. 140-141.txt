Note that an analogue of this protocol is possible, using only horizontal superposition in 2-cathegors. Literature 1.

Sozontova1 1 Sozontova-elena@rambler.ru; The Elabuga Institute of KFU describes new options for solving the problem of Gurs in quadrators for a two -dimensional second -order system. Keywords: Gurs's task, solvability in quadrature. Task 1. In the field of D Find the regular solution of the system {ux y +a1ux +b1uy +c1vx +d1vy +e1u +f1v = g1, vx y +a2ux +b2uy +c2vx +d2vy +e2u +f2v = g2, (1) satisfying conditions u (x0, y) = wor (y), u (x, y0) = ψ1 (x), v (x0, y) = ng (y), v (x, y0) = ψ2 (x), С y0) = ψ1 (x0), ∗2 (y0) = ψ2 (x0). (2) In this case, it is assumed that ∗1, ∗2 ∈C 1 (x), ψ1, ψ2 ∈C 1 (Y), and the smoothness of the system (1) is determined by inclusions A1, A2, C1, C2 ∈C (1, 0), B1, C1, C2, D2 ∈C (0.1), E1, E2, F1, F2 ∈C (0.0). E.A. Sozontova 141 is known [1, p. 67] that the solution of this problem exists and only. In [2] the conditions for solvability of problem 1 in quadrature were obtained. This work provides new cases of resolving this task in explicit form. The following ratios and identity h = AX +AB - C, K = BY +Ab - C, ωR = 2S ′ R (X) T ′ R (2–MR) [SR (x) play an important role. + tr (y)] 2, [sr (x)+ tr (y)] s ′ r (x) t ′ r (y) ̸ = 0.
