Solving one four -element regional problem of the riman type in the classes of meta -analytical functions, let T+ - the final single -link area on the plane of the complex alternating z = x+ iy, limited by a simple closed smooth contour l, and T- = C \ (T+ U L), where C - where s - where s - where s Expanded complex plane. In the yes, mainly, we will adhere to the terms of it and the notations adopted in [1], [2]. Consider the following regional task. Demand. I am all in a piece of metaanalytic functions f (z) = = {f+(z), p- (z)} class.a m2 (t ±) n h (i) (l), 'us 'Conditions that are in vicinity and satisfying on L to the next edge: a () df+(t) a () df+(t) 1 j t dx+12 t dx, df- (t) = g11 (t ) dx + g12 (t) dx + 91 (t), (1) 56 D. s.

In equality (2), the multipliers -1 at A22 (t), G22 (t) and an imaginary unit for G2 (t) are introduced for the convenience of further designations. The formulated task will be called the first OS Four -elemental regional task of the Riemann type in the classes of meta -analytical functions (or, briefly, the task of G R41), and: the corresponding homogeneous task (91 (t) = 92 (t) = = o) - the task GR ~ 1 . In this message, the conditions of the networks for the GR41 cottages and the constructive method of solving it were obtained in the case, th COG T+ = {Z: lzl <1}. Literature 1. Rasulov K. M.
